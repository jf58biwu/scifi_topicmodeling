 No real ones . But there are . She 's perfect . Careful . Two centimetres . OK . Yeah . Ready with that amnio . And ... there it is . Be careful . Jesus ... Clamp . What about her ? Can we keep her alive ? How 's the host ? Doing well . Sew her back up . Excellent work . Everybody . How is our Number Eight today ? Appears to be in good health . - How good ? - Excellent . As in completely off our projected charts . Look at the scar tissue . See the recession ? - This is from three days ago ? - Exactly . Well , this is good . This is very good . You 're going to make us all very proud . Don 't ! I 'm all right ! Now try this . Hand . Close . Glove . Number Eight ? Fruit . Good . Cherries . - It 's unprecedented . - Totally . She 's operating at a completely adult capacity . - What about her memories ? - There are gaps . Synaptic dissonance . She 's freaked . It has difficulties , caused by a biochemical imbalance , causing emotional autism ... Wait . It has memories ! Why does it have memories ? I 'm guessing , but ... inherited memories , passed down generationally by the aliens , like its strength . Plus a highly evolved form of instinct . An unexpected benefit of genetic crossing . Oh ... I see . Stupid me . Of course . An unexpected benefit of the genetic process ! I didn 't even think ofthat ! - You 're not thinking termination ? - Oh , boy , am I ? ! General , this is not a problem . Ellen Ripley died trying to wipe this species out . She practically succeeded . I don 't want her taking up old hobbies . - That won 't happen . - We won 't tell her . Oh , I see , and that 's supposed to comfort me . Identification , please . Please tryagain . Thank you , GeneralPerez . The bottom line is , she looks at me funny one time , I 'm putting her down . OK , as far as I 'm concerned Number Eight is a meat ... by-product . Her Majesty here is the real payoff . - When does she start producing ? - Days . Less , maybe . - We need the cargo . - I told you , it 's on its way . Fork . Fuck . It 's a fork . How did you ... How did we get you ? Yes . Hard work . We used blood samples , from Fiori 16 , on ice . Where you died . We 've remade you . Cloned you . Does it grow ? Yeah . Very rapidly . It 's a queen . How did you know that ? She 'll breed . You 'll die . Everyyone in the company will die . In the ... in the company ? Weyland Yutani . Ripley Eight 's former employers . Terran growth conglomerate . They had ... defence contracts under the military . I think you will find that things have changed a great deal since your time . I doubt that . We 're not flying blind here . This is United Systems Military , not some greedy corporation . Oh . It won 't make any difference . You 're still gonna die . How do you feel about that ? I wish you could understand what we 're doing here . The potential for this species goes way beyond urban pacification . New alloys , vaccines . Nothing like this , we 've ever seen before . You should be proud . Oh . I am . And the animal itself , wondrous . The potential , unbelievable . Once we 've tamed him . Roll over ? Play dead ? Heel ? You can 't teach it tricks . Why not ? We 're teaching you . Time to enjoy some of the General 's hospitality , Christie . Great . Army food . Yeah , it 'll do till we get the family wagon up to spec . Yeah . That is , ifthe natives are friendly . How 's that ? Good . Are we expecting any , uh , trouble ? From Perez , I doubt it , but you never know . We 've been there before . - Where are the others ? - ln the cargo bay . What is wrong with you ? Just a little target practice . Vriess isn 't complaining . Goddamn it ! Johner , you son of a bitch ! Come on , man , you didn 't feel a thing . Whoa ... The knife . Son of a bitch ! Don 't push me , little Call .

Could you repeat that ? Prick . You know , no matter how many times you see it , the sight of a woman all strapped up in a chair like thatjust ... What ? Just bring us in on a 3-0 descent .

How you been ? Wanna check the chair ? Elgyn , these were very , very hard to come by . So was our cargo . You 're not about to plead poverty on me , are you , General ? Few people deal in cash now . Just the ones don 't like to keep business records . Yourself , for example . Drink ? Constantly . I 'm gonna take a ... wild guess here , General , but I 'm thinking whatever you got going on here , it ain 't exactly approved by Congress . Who 's the new filly you got on board ? Call ? Little girl playing pirates . She makes an impression . She is severely fuckable , ain 't she ? Mind you , I think she 's just a tad curious about this transaction of ours . I can 't say as I blame her . It 's awfully cloak-and-dagger stuff . It 's a military operation . Really ? Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I was under the impression that most army medical labs don 't operate outside of regulated space . What do you want ? Me ? Yeah . Two days bed and board . Vriess might want to snag a part or two . I mean , if it 's not imposing . Mi casa es su casa . Please direct cargo to med-lab centre , area G. Follow the litpath . Do not deviate .

You mean my baby ? I don 't get it . If they took it out , why keep you alive ? Well , they 're curious . I 'm the latest thing . Look , I can make it all stop .

Smells like a double-cross , boss . Where 's the other one ? With the chair . Don 't ever touch me . Ever ! - Wanna tell us what this is ? - Wanna tell me who you 're working for ? Wren , they 're not involved . With what ? Do you know the penalty for terrorist activity ? There are no terrorists in my crew . Call , you got something to say ? I don 't care ifyou knew . You brought a terrorist on board . As far as I am concerned , you all die with her ! Do you understand ? Yeah . I understand . Christie . Freeze ! Stop ! Drop your weapons !

If we 're gonna survive this mess we all stick together . Agreed ? Hillard , we gotta go . It 's not over . We gotta get to the Betty . Make a nice souvenir . I can 't believe you did that .

To make decent time , let 's ditch the cripple . - No offence , man . - None taken . Nobody is left behind . Not even you , Johner . - What 's the quickest way out ? - After the cooling tower , there 's an elevator .

There 's no way you can tell . She 's right . - It 's been go since the attack . - It 's a standard emergency procedure . Any serious problem , the ship autopilots to home base .

He 's got one inside . I can smell it . Inside me ? Inside me ? What 's inside me ? I don 't want one ofthose things birthing anywhere near my ass . It 's a bad risk . What 's inside me ? - We can 't leave him . - You came here to stop them spreading . - What 's inside me ? - Can 't you stop it ? We 've got no time . The lab 's out of order . I could do him . Back ofthe head . Painless . Might be the best way . What 's inside me ? There must be another way . - What ifwe freeze him ? - What 's in-fucking-side me ? ! There 's a monster in your chest . These guys hijacked your ship , and they sold your cryotube to this ... human . And he put an alien inside ofyou . It 's a really nasty one . And in a few hours it will burst its way through your ribcage . And you 're gonna die . Any questions ? Who are you ? I 'm the monster 's mother .

Yeah . Just like old times . Yeah . Must be the cooling tanks . Somebody must have opened the valves . The nasties couldn 't do that , could they ? We 're at the bottom ofthe ship . We have to go through the kitchen . Maybe 90ft . To the elevator on the other side . I don 't like it . What 's to like ? This sucks ! Are you sure about the distance ? Yes ! You ready to get wet , partner ? Yeah . Hey , Christie , do me a favour . When we hit the surface , no backstroke , OK ? Jesus Christ ! It set a goddamn trap . It 's a goddamn ambush ! Distephano !

You got body armour on ? Yeah . Come on . You took it in the chest . I saw it . You 're a robot ? Son of a bitch ! - Little Call is full of surprises . - I should 've known . No human being is that humane . I thought synthetics were logical . You just a big old psycho , girl ! You 're a robot ? You 're a Second Gen , aren 't you ? You 're an Auton ? Robots designed by robots , right ? I remember . They were meant to revitalise the synthetic industry . Instead they buried it . They don 't like being told what to do . Government ordered a recall . Now , I heard ... I heard that only a few had gotten out in time . Man , I never thought that I would see one ! Great . She 's a toaster oven . Can we leave now ? How long before we land ? Under two hours . Vriess , you got a wrench ? Maybe she just needs an oil change . Sorry . Access denied . And I almost fucked it . Like you never fucked a robot ! If Wren gets in the computer he could really screw us . - We gotta find a terminal . - Not on this level . We 'd have to go back . We can 't go back . - I don 't know Wren 's access codes . - Help me . Call ... No . I can 't . You 're the new model . You can access the mainframe . No , I can 't . I burned my modem . We all did . Call , you can still patch in manually . You know that . There 's ports in the chapel , up there . Call ... You 're programmed for that ? Don 't make me do this . Don 't make me make you . I don 't wanna go in there . It 's like my insides are liquid . It 's not real . Get over it . You can blow this ship before it reaches Earth , and kill them all . Just give us time to get out first . Damn it ! Anything ? Hold on . Breach in sectorseven , sector three . Sector nine unstable . 86 minutes untilEarth dock . We burn too much energy . I can 't make critical mass . I can 't blow it . Then crash it . I 'm OK . I 'm OK . Really . I feel good . Ground levelrecalibrated . Time tillimpact 43 minutes , 8 seconds .

You must think this is pretty funny . I 'm finding a lot ofthings funny lately . But I don 't think they are . Why do you go on living ? How can you stand being what you are ? Not much choice . At least there 's a part ofyou that 's human . I 'm just ... Look at me . I 'm disgusting . Why did you come here ? To kill you . Remember ? Before the recall , I accessed the mainframe . Every covert op the government ever dreamed up is in there . And this , you , the aliens , even the crew from the Betty . I knew if they succeeded it 'd be the end ofthem . Why do you care what happens to them ? Because I 'm programmed to . You 're programmed to be an asshole ? You 're the new asshole model they 're putting out ? Come on ! I guess we 're almost there . It 's not so far now ! - I 'm so tired ! - You can sleep when you die ! Oh , no . This is bad , right ? I think we 're near the nest . - We 'll go another way . - We don 't have time . - We got 90 minutes . - Not any more . What ? - What did you do , robot ? - Let 's go . Come on . Hey ! You wanna die here , with your family , that 's cool . But I plan to live past today . If this hunk of plastic pulls any shit , I 'm gonna kill her ! Kill you ! Does that compute ? ! Or do I have to draw you a schematic ? Hey ! You want another souvenir ? How far are the docks ? 100 yards . Ripley ? Come on ! Ripley , we have to go . I hear them . I hear them . They 're so close . - Ripley ... - It 's the queen . She 's in pain . Ripley ! Ripley ! Wait ! Oh , my God . We gotta be moving . The best thing we can do is pray for a quick death . Come on . Come on . It 's not right . I 've been saying that all day . Call , I need you to patch into the ship , and open the hatch . Johner , we should put Purvis in the freezer now . All right , little buddy . Nap time . Oh ... Nobody moves , or I put a cap right where this little droid 's brain is . Distephano , take the weapons . Excuse me , sir , but ... fuck you ! Fine . Then I kill her , and you kill me , and we all die , and nobody goes home ! Now drop the weapon ! Then this little synthetic bitch is gonna plug into the Auriga , and take us back to home base , according to standard procedure . No , she 's not ! Are you crazy ? You 'd bring those things back to Earth ? - Haven 't you been paying attention ? - Ah , the intellectual speaks ! - Listen , if ... - Don 't you ever shut up ? Why does nobody listen to me ? I told you , at first everything was normal . The queen laid her eggs . But then she started to change . She added a second cycle so ... So ... this time there is no host . There are no eggs . There is only her womb and the creature inside . That is Ripley 's gift to her : A human reproductive system . She is giving birth for you , Ripley . And now she is perfect !

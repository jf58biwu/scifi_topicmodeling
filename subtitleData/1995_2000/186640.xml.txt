 [ People shouting ] [ People chanting ] [ Shouting ] [ People continue chanting ] [ Hissing ] No ! Please , no . [ Coughing ] [ Whooshing ] [ Rembrandt exclaiming ] You know what else I miss about Professor ? Soft landings . Whenever he was around , I always had a cush spot to aim for . So you were aiming ? [ Wheezes ] What does this gizmo tell us ? Rickman landed about here and he hasn 't slid out yet . We don 't have much time to find him . Less than two days on the [ all coughing ] World . What 's wrong with you guys ? I think it 's the fog . [ Coughing ] I can 't breathe . We have to get you guys out of the fog . Rembrandt , grab Wade . Come on ! [ Wade coughing ] [ All coughing ] I told you they 'd be coming for me . ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . I guess now we know how Maggie must 've felt when she landed on our world and couldn 't breathe . There 's a path over there and I think it leads to a town just below . Where 'd Maggie go ? ( Quinn ) She went back in ? I told her not to . She 's gonna get herself killed . She can breathe in there , Q-Ball . She should be okay . And when she can 't ? I 'm going after her . No way . Look , you 're not risking your life . Look , I know it sounds cold , okay , but where do we draw the line , huh ? We 've already lost one of us . I don 't want that to happen again . Does that " us " include Maggie ? So that 's how it is . It 's us , then her ? Relax , guys . I wouldn 't want you to risk your precious lives . Nice to know where you stand , though . Any sign of Rickman ? No . Let 's head into town , see if he made a visit there . I 'm going back in , higher up this time . I 'll catch up with you guys in town . Maggie , we 've been through this . We don 't split up unless we have to . We stick together . We work as a team . Team ? I got the impression I wasn 't officially on the team . Congratulations . You 've just been drafted . That 's okay , guys . I was never a very good team player . Beckett ! You go back into that fog , you lose your bus ticket through the inter-dimension . When Rickman slides , you 're stuck here . No way to track him , no way to avenge your husband 's death . Now , like it or not , you 're one of us . Nice to know where you stand , though . ( man # 1 ) You better watch those over there ! [ Dog barking ] ( man # 2 ) Y 'all don 't try nothing strange . Y 'all just , uh , passing through town , right ? Actually , you know , we 're thinking of buying property in the area . Maybe you could point us towards the realtor 's office ? Your woman needs to be taught some manners . And I bet you 're just the person to do that , huh ? Billy T , you leave those folks alone . ( boy ) Mom ! Bye . Don 't mind Billy T , he ain 't never been to Miss Porter 's . Hanged man . Good card . Wisdom , self-sacrifice , sometimes death . Hard to tell from just one turn . Sit down . I 'll do your read . Oh , please . I 'm with you on this . She 's blind . In tarot legends , a blind seer is the most powerful of all . Guys , a clinic . ( Quinn ) Nice place to check out blood types . Yeah . He needs fresh brain cells to stay alive . No ! You are not what I expected . Your face is different . Sorry to disappoint you . It ain 't about me . Y 'all must leave these hills . Death is waiting on you . It 's your choice . You 're not responsible for him . Oh , yeah . She 's normal . She 's scared . ( Quinn ) Wade ? Look , she might be for real , Quinn . L ... I think we should hear her out . I 'm gonna ask her what she saw . Oh , come on ! We don 't have time for this ! Let her go . Let 's see what the clinic can tell us . ( Adra ) He 's here to save himself . That 's all . You tell him that . And he 's not to go into the fog . How do you know Quinn ? [ Chair creaking ] Quinn , that his name ? Yeah . That boy 's in trouble . I 've seen him at night . He can 't sleep for his fears . It 's been really hard on him lately . We lost somebody that he cared about very much . Is that why he beckons death ? Why he waits for the ax to strike ? No . Quinn 's not like that . He 's looking for death . He 'll find it in the fog . Adra , we 're here looking for a man who brings death with him . Maybe that 's what you see in the fog . Quinn 's death will be by his own hand . There ain 't no other involved . Beware the Foggins . They live above the fog line . They 'll steal your life away while you ain 't looking . Don 't tempt them . We won 't . The man you seek wears a uniform . He 's one of them now . He exists up there , but he 's not strong . He only gets half a life . That 's right . He leaves his victims in comas . Look , Adra , please , if you can help us . We need to stop him . Hello ? Well , either Rickman 's been here already , or they are not very big on filing . Type " A , " " A negative , " " B , " " O. " " Theodore Lloyd . " The address has been ripped out . " Lucy LaCroix . " Her info sheet 's been ripped out , too . It 's like he 's making a list of donors for his booster shots . He needs more info than just blood types for an injection . Otherwise he 'd just be shooting in the dark . Well , take a look at this place . Not exactly the hub of modern medicine . All right . Let 's make a list of the files he took . We 'd better find those people before ... ( Rembrandt ) What is it ? A burned-out microchip . His timer fried . Wade , we 've got Rickman . His timer burned a chip on entry . He 's here somewhere looking for his next victim . He got her . Last night . He attacked a girl named Lucy LaCroix . ( Rembrandt ) She 's on the list . He 's gonna keep doing this until we stop him . Look , we 've got 17 names of people left on that list that he may go after . Now , will she help us with addresses ? First you see Lucy . Adra wants us to take a look at Lucy . See if we can do anything for her . It 's better we warn the others before the Colonel strikes again . If you want my help , you gotta help Lucy . I still think it were the Foggins . Foggins ? I 'll explain on the way . If he didn 't get his injection on the last world , he might be getting a little desperate . Yeah , I would be , too , if I had a fungus attacking my brain . We 're here . [ Birds chirping ] [ Door closes ] How 's she doing ? No change . They got her . They got her good . Who are they ? They say they can help her . How ? If we could see her , we could tell you more . This has nothing to do with your fog men . The man we 're after did this to your daughter . I got a shot at him before he disappeared into the fog . Did you hit him ? You bet . Left a trail of blood out there . I 'm not sure there 's much we can do for her . I 'm sorry . Not your fault , but I appreciate it . ( Quinn ) Definitely Rickman . Not a very neat job , either . I don 't think he got his full injection . Well , that 's good . That ups the odds she can come out of this . How do you figure that ? Back at the base , they were experimenting with neural stimulation techniques on the coma victims . It was working . If they would have lived , they would have made it . You know what techniques they were using ? Yeah , I ... I think so . Good . You stay here and work with Lucy . We 're gonna go back to the fog line . Bunt shot at Rickman , says he got a piece of him . Which means maybe he didn 't get that far . That 's what I 'm thinking . ( Bunt ) Come along . Let 's go . [ Door closes ] [ Birds cawing ] Here 's where I got him . Well , something was hit . Let 's hope it was short , with an English accent . Let 's hope he 's up there suffering . Remember , this is just a recon job . We don 't know how it 'll affect you after more than a few minutes . I was okay the last time . You weren 't in that long . You start coughing , 10 minutes or not , you get right back here . Won 't do much good , but it might give you a minute . If she don 't make it back , you 'll need it to bring her out . ( Bunt ) Fog 's poison . Kills you if you breathe too much . [ Maggie coughs ] [ Watch beeping ] ( Rickman ) Maggie , is that you ? Maggie , you 're looking for me , aren 't you ? Colonel ? Col. Rickman ! Oh , yes , it 's me ! [ Chuckling ] I 'm sorry about Steven . But he wasn 't really man enough for you , was he ? Maybe I did you a favor . You bastard ! [ Gasps ] [ Gasping ] [ Coughing ] Oh , yes , it 's me . The face has a way of changing with these injections . We 're different , Maggie . Our lungs are stronger . It hurts to breathe now . But in a couple of days , you 'll get used to it . You 'll even start to enjoy it . [ Coughing ] It 's not time yet , but soon . Tell Mallory that . Soon . Maggie ! Maggie ! Maggie ! [ Grunting ] Come on , it 's me ! It 's me ! Here . Come on . I 've got you . Let 's go . [ Coughing ] ( Maggie ) He told me to tell you : Soon . L ... I have no idea what that means . Are you sure it was him ? It was the Colonel . I know it . I don 't care if you believe me or not . It doesn 't make sense . It was him , but it didn 't look like him ? I know . But you heard her . Probably just the fog playing tricks . Has a way of making you see things . How is that ? What 's in it ? It 's got a power of its own . Don 't know why . It 's sulfur . You can smell it . Must be a volcano under here . The fog forms when hot vapors hit the air . It also explains why it chokes people . The oxygen is binding with the sulfur . Your lungs can 't break it up when they need to . You 've been hanging out with me way too long . Don 't I know it . ( Adra ) Wade , let the girl rest . She 's too far in the fog . Your methods can 't reach her . I was sure this would work . We 've given your ways a chance . Now , let 's try mine . In order to beat the haints , you gotta go into their world . The fog outside is the darkness . All of us have it inside . You gotta move past the haze , y 'all come to the truth . This fog , this darkness , it 's our creature . We make it . We control it . It 'll do our bidding . A strand of your hair . If we 're to cast off the evil for Lucy , it couldn 't hurt to throw in a little spell for you , too . Thanks . I 'm sure I could use one . I am , too . It ain 't a game , Wade . You 're in danger , all of you . If you can 't defeat the evil , the evil defeats you . You gotta be strong if you 're ever gonna complete this journey . No ifs . I 'm getting home or I 'm gonna die trying . Oh , my God . Lucy ? What 's happening ? She passed out again . Sweet Jay ! She 's up . ( Wade ) She 's burning up . I don 't remember the other victims going through anything like this . It 's the Foggins , struggling to keep her . Be strong , Luce . You can beat them . How 's she doing ? Well , all they keep saying is , " It 's them . Them . " There is no " them . " The girl is sick . If she doesn 't get any medical attention , she 's going to die . There 's got to be a hospital here somewhere . I 'll go check it out . I 'll go with you . No hospitals . She 'll be fine . Look , no offense , Mr. LaCroix , but you don 't know that . Now , what you know for sure is that Lucy is getting worse , not better . It 's like Adra says , sometimes it 's like that before you come out of the fog . It has nothing to do with Adra or the fog , sir . She 's fighting some type of an infection . She needs antibiotics . Don 't you see that you 're letting her die by holding onto your superstitions ? Look . Give her a chance . Let us take her to a hospital . She 's my daughter . I ain 't gonna let her die . Adra 's spell casting worked once . It 'll work again . He 's making a big mistake . Adra , maybe you can say something to him ? It ain 't no use . Bunt lost his wife in a hospital . He 's not about to lose a child , too . Besides , local hospitals don 't much understand the hold the Foggins have . Oh , you fools . ( Wade ) Remmy . ( Rembrandt ) Look , they 're risking her life . In my book , that makes them fools . Maybe you think we 're fools . Maybe we are . But the craft is our faith . In my book , faith is all that really matters . Beware the fog . You mustn 't go in . If you do , you 'll never come out . I 'll be fine . ( Wade ) Just because you don 't understand something , doesn 't mean it 's not real . I would 've thought that you , of all people , would get that . Yeah , well , I don 't . Not in this case . Is it just me , or is Remmy acting a little touchy today ? A little . We all are . It might be aftereffects from the fog . ( Maggie ) I think he 's fine . He 's just not buying into all of Adra 's phony powers . Maggie , you haven 't been to the places I 've been . You haven 't seen the things I 've seen . So don 't judge me or my beliefs . Found a still , huh ? All these jars are labeled " Witches ' Butter . " Maybe that 's their moonshine . I guess . Remmy , please . Look , I ... I ... I don 't know why this whole thing with Adra has you feeling the way that you do . Yeah . You 're right . You don 't . So tell me . Remmy , all I meant was that you , out of all of us , have a faith that guides you , just like Adra and Bunt do . Wade , there is a difference between faith and superstition . So don 't compare me to them ! I 'm sorry you 're upset . I 'm also sorry that you can 't put your anger aside to listen to my apology . [ Crickets chirping ] ( Quinn ) There were 17 possible targets on Rickman 's hit list . Six are pretty close . The rest are spread for miles . I know the Colonel . He 's going to hone in on the six that are easiest to hit . All right . Choose three and grab Remmy . Wade and I 'll take the others . [ Crickets chirping ] You want to talk about it ? What happened to you out there today ? I told you . I saw Rickman . You told me what you saw . What you didn 't tell me is how you felt . Must 've been pretty scary . Passing out , almost dying ? You don 't expect me to get all weepy now , do you ? What was I thinking ? I have no idea . Hey , Wade just come in here ? We thought she was with you . ( Wade ) Help ! Rickman . He 'll take her into the fog . ( Quinn ) Wade ! Wade ! [ Gasping ] [ Rickman laughing ] [ Gun firing ] You crazy ? You could hit her ! ( Quinn ) Wade ? I 'm okay . He didn 't get me . ( Wade ) There he is . Quinn , wait ! This doesn 't feel right . [ Gun cocking ] He 's out there . I 'll head him off . [ Quinn coughing ] ( Rickman ) Having trouble breathing , Mallory ? Weird in here , isn 't it ? The fog makes you see things , or does it ? Just a little more , Mallory . Breathe it in . [ Wheezing ] Watch out . He 's in there . We gotta get you out of here . You gonna pull back before the mission 's finished ? You always were slow on the draw , Beckett . [ Gun firing ] Damn it , Mallory ! I almost had him ! [ Exclaims ] [ Groans ] Excellent . Let 's get them up the mountain . No ! [ Groans ] [ Rembrandt coughing ] No sign of them . Damn it ! They should 've just let Rickman go . Quinn thought he had a stab at it . In there ? It 's like nothing 's real in the fog . I 'll tell you what 's real . Quinn 's gone and we 've got 12 hours before the slide . You know , when I was in the fog , something kept flashing in my mind . That Witches ' Butter . The shed smelled a lot like the fog . Yeah . Figured you 'd seen the still . What 's the deal , Bunt ? I know it 's connected to the fog . Without the Witches ' Butter , you can 't make the tea . Without the tea , you can 't go into the fog . Look , Bunt , we 've gotta go back in there . If your tea makes that possible ... It 's a fresh batch . Needs time to mellow . We don 't have time . Even when it 's aged , most folks can 't keep it down . Yeah , well , we can stomach it . Look , we may need a guide . Oh , hell , no ! Risky enough just going in there trying to get quick grabs . Any more than that , Foggins 'll kill you for sure . [ Sighing ] All right . Look , how much of it do we have to drink ? [ Chuckles ] You 'll know when to stop . It kind of decides for you . Then wait 20 minutes before starting out . Canteen 's in there , too . Thanks . Look , you keep Lucy doing those exercises . She 'll be just fine . Wouldn 't suggest it normally , but Adra took to you . In your shoes , I 'd ask her about the village . ( Maggie ) Rickman ! Show your face ! I know you 're behind this ! Quinn ! Where are you taking her ? Fight them , Maggie ! Rickman ! Let me out of here ! Open up this damn cage . It 's not my decision . I told him he was wasting his time . You 're not like us . But he wants to help you . Who ? I told him you wouldn 't understand . They 've drugged you , Rickman . Oh , no . They don 't have to . It 's the fog . All that sulfur builds up on the brain . He understands , man . I mean , he really understands why I had to do what I did . You 're a butcher . That 's all . I wouldn 't get too cozy in all that righteousness if I was you , Mallory . [ Snickering ] Without you , I wouldn 't be sliding . I 'm gonna get you , Rickman . Nothing 's gonna keep me from it . Still worked up about your dead professor ? You bastard ! [ Laughing ] You know what the funny thing is ? They were going to kill me . Then I told him about you . How you were following after me . Then everything changed . You 're my savior , man . ( Adra ) I warned you not to let him go . He 's been taken . We need to get to the village . Bunt said you could take us . [ Rembrandt snorts ] ( Rembrandt ) This is so damn typical . You sit there smoking , acting like you know everything . When people come to you with a concrete problem , something you can help them with , all of a sudden , you know nothing . I was wrong about you . Thought you really didn 't want to know . Thought that Haiti was in your way . I just want to know where Quinn 's been taken . That 's all . If you have any idea , the least you could do is tell us . A village up the mountain way . Where I was born . You 're one of them ? True . Born and raised . But even by their gauge , I was wild . I fell in love with one from here . I gave him the power of the butter witch so he could come visit me in the fog . They killed him , and blinded me for crossing the line . I 'm so sorry , Adra . ( Adra ) My people see no betweens . The blind on me is what the eyes of them won 't bear . All they fear , I see now . Can we use their fear against them to get Quinn back ? You won 't get Quinn back . If you make it to the village , burn this . They 'll respect its power . For your journey up the mountain . Thanks . We work better in the dark . Come on . All right . Let me go , damn it ! Whatever you 're planning , you can forget it . Oh , no . Not again . [ Exhales ] Water . Please , water . [ Villagers chattering ] I bet he 'd be happy if he knew I was thirsty ? Let me out of this cage , or I kill you . [ Croaks ] Say something . ( Quinn 2 ) You 're not a killer . Not yet . You 're almost there . You shouldn 't have stopped , though . To die in the hands of a god , that 's what they want . That 's what we all want . ( Rembrandt ) The tea is working . I can breathe , but my mind 's acting a little wild . Mine , too . Here . Oh ! [ Rembrandt exclaims ] [ Coughs ] You don 't look so good . Oh , it 's the tea . Look , I 'm sorry about the way I 've been treating you . I guess , uh , this slide has just gotten to me a little , huh . It seemed like Adra knew why . Yeah , well ... [ sighs ] Something did happen back there in Haiti . I was stationed there for a while , and , uh , I made a good friend with one of the locals . He was a lot like Adra . He had more heart than anybody I 've known . [ Chuckles ] And God , did he have a voice . What he didn 't know was that I had hooked him up with my record label . And so the day that I told him , he , he just thanked me and said that he was going to die . You see , he had had his cards read that day . No wonder you reacted like you did . I mean , it wasn 't that he just gave up on life , Wade . It was how he made it a crusade . You know , wanting to prove to me that it would happen the way the cards said . [ Sighs ] I tell you , that superstitious will , it took him down , right before my eyes . He believed himself to death . I 'm sorry , Remmy . Yeah , yeah . What a freaking waste . [ Coughs ] Come on . [ Villagers chattering ] You let these people worship you ? Now I know I 'm right . You 're exploiting them . They see you vortex in , of course they 're gonna think you 're a god . You can 't use it like this . Being worshipped means nothing to me . This has to do with our salvation . Our salvation ? Hard to believe , you 've been sliding almost as long as I have . What do you know about me ? Three years ago , on your home world , I gave you the final part of the equation . Without me , you would never be here . That can 't be you . No one could change that much . Strip your friends away . Slide alone like I have , you 'd be just like me . Here I am . The undeniably horrible . The unimaginably disgusting proof , that I 'm you without your friends . ( Maggie ) No ! What are you going to do with her ? It 's a simple equation . Much more simple than the one I solved for you . You kill me , the villagers will let you live . You do nothing , she dies . You 're insane . And you are weak . But I 'm gonna help you with that . Clean him up . Take him to the cave . You don 't have to live like this . We slide out of here soon . Slide with us ! I 'll never slide again . ( Rembrandt ) If we don 't find that village soon , we 'll be drinking tea here for the next 29 years . ( Wade ) We 've got to be close . We 've been out of the fog over an hour . If we are close , I can 't tell here . See what you can make out of it . [ People chanting ] Do you hear that ? You can 't fix his timer . You can 't let him keep sliding . A deal 's a deal . Get it now , Mallory ? I bring you to him , he fixes my timer and I 'm on my merry way . He 's a killer . Wouldn 't be the first time I helped one . [ Electronic beeping ] No . Think about what you 're doing . It 's done . [ Whooshing ] Man , what happened to you ? The Kromags happened to me . Don 't feel sorry for me . I 'm responsible for the Kromags . [ Whooshing ] ( Quinn 2 ) Responsible for all the worlds they pillaged . The populations they enslaved . They couldn 't have done it without me . You gave them the equation ? I gave them the formula and they destroyed my home . Hate me , like they hate . Instinctively . The Kromags act with a crystal-like willful intelligence . The brilliance of that . You have to see it . You don 't believe that . You can 't believe that . [ Beeping ] Tick-tock , tick-tock . Your friends , they 're coming for you , aren 't they ? Probably . Must be nice . Must be nice ? They 're probably gonna die in that fog trying to get here ! Don 't worry . The fog changes everything inside of you . Shut up ! [ Whispers ] I 'm trying to open your mind . You see what I really am . I want you to hate me . You have to . You have to kill me . I need to know I 've done something to turn things around . Killing you won 't change anything . It will change you . It will make you strong like them . Strong enough to get home , to protect it , to protect the ones you love . Like I couldn 't . This is how it all started . Just an equation on a wall . God only knows where it will lead us . What horrors . I need you , Quinn . I need you to stop me . I can 't stop myself . This is the end . [ People chanting ] Either me or her ? Your choice . No . [ Quinn 2 grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ People chanting ] [ People continue chanting ] We 're gonna need Adra 's power . You got the bag ? Yeah . So who 's gonna run out there and test it out ? [ People continue chanting ] You always do paper . Yeah , and you always do rock . Look , never mind , I 'll do it . No . It 's okay . I 'll distract them . You just make sure you get her out alive . You realize you 're asking me to risk my life for her , right ? We drafted her . I will not become like you . [ Both grunting ] Finish me . Kill me . Save her and yourself . I won 't kill you , but they might , when they find out you 're not a god but just a man . [ People chanting ] [ People exclaiming ] You 'll be free in a sec . Where 's Q-Ball ? In one of the caves . [ Rembrandt grunting ] [ Maggie exclaims ] [ People exclaiming ] [ Quinn screaming ] Wade ! Come on , girl ! ( Rembrandt ) Go ! You okay ? Yeah . Go ! [ Whooshing ]

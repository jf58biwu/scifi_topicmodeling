 CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS . AND IT IS OUR FIRM BELIEF THAT CAPTAIN GIDEON IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR THIS JOB . HIS REPUTATION- - OH , WE ARE AWARE OF YOUR CAPTAIN 'S REPUTATION . HE HAS TAKEN PART IN MORE BATTLES DURING PEACETIME THAN MOST OFFICERS FACE IN A MAJOR WAR . HIS LATEST INVOLVED ONE OF OUR CAPTAINS WHO WAS JUSTIFIABLY UPSET AFTER LOSING EVERYTHING HE OWNED IN A CARD GAME- - LOSING TO YOU . Gideon : HE BET EVERYTHING HE HAD ON A BLUFF . NOT MY FAULT . GENERAL , WE RECOGNIZE THAT EARTH WILL DIE UNLESS YOU CAN FIND A CURE FOR THIS TERRIBLE VIRUS OFF WORLD . BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW PASSAGE THROUGH OUR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF SPACE UNTIL WE ARE SURE THIS WILL NOT LEAD TO AN INCIDENT . CAPTAIN GIDEON WAS CHOSEN PERSONALLY BY PRESIDENT SHERIDAN TO LEAD THIS MISSION . AS HEAD OF THE INTERSTELLAR ALLIANCE AND THE ONE WHO 'S PROVIDING US WITH THEEXCALIBUR- - IT STILL REQUIRES OUR APPROVAL . SINCE YOU ENJOY GAMBLING , CAPTAIN , I WILL MAKE A WAGER WITH YOU . AGREE , AND WE WILL ALLOW YOU FREE PASSAGE IN ANY AREA OF OUR JURISDICTION . Gideon : WHAT 'S THE BET ? YOU SAY THIS VIRUS WILL BECOME ACTIVE IN 5 YEARS . AT THAT POINT , EVERY MAN , WOMAN , AND CHILD OF YOUR WORLD WILL DIE , CORRECT ? THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO MOVE FREELY FOR 4 YEARS . IF YOU CANNOT FIND A CURE FOR THE VIRUS BY THEN , YOU WILL SPEND THE FIFTH YEAR IN ORBIT AROUND YOUR HOME WORLD . WHY ? AS THE DAY OF PLANETARY DEATH LOOMS CLOSER , YOUR PEOPLE WILL BECOME DESPERATE , FRIGHTENED , IRRATIONAL . MANY OF THEM WILL TRY TO ESCAPE FROM EARTH . YOU WILL STOP THEM BY PERSONALLY SHOOTING DOWN ANY SHIP TRYING TO LEAVE . AMBASSADOR- - WE DO NOT WANT YOUR KIND SPREADING THIS VIRUS TO OUR WORLDS IN A BLIND PANIC . WHAT WILL IT BE , CAPTAIN ? WILL YOU AGREE TO SHOOT DOWN YOUR OWN SHIPS , KILL YOUR OWN PEOPLE , IF YOU CANNOT FIND A CURE IN 4 YEARS ? DAMN IT , CAPTAIN , YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE AGREED TO THAT . YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE MADE A BET WITH THE DEVIL . Gideon : LOOK WHAT 'S AT STAKE , SIR . IF I COULD FIND HIM , I 'D BRING THE CARDS MYSELF . WELL , THERE 'S YOUR SHIP . A ONE-OF-A-KIND PROTOTYPE . THE BEST SHIP WE 'VE GOT . GOOD LUCK WITH HER , SON . BECAUSE UNLESS WE FIND SOMETHING AT HOME TO BEAT THAT DAMN VIRUS , YOU AND YOUR CREW AND THAT SHIP ARE THE LAST BEST HOPE OF EARTH . DON 'T SCREW IT UP . [ COMMUNICATOR BEEPS ] [ COMMUNICATOR BEEPS ] [ BEEP BEEP ] [ BEEP BEEP ] YES . DR. CHAMBERS HERE , CAPTAIN . WE 'VE MOVED INTO THE NEXT ROW OF BUILDINGS , BEGINNING OUR ANALYSIS . SO FAR SO GOOD . THEN I EXPECT TROUBLE AT ANY MINUTE . YOU 'RE A PESSIMIST , CAPTAIN . I 'M A REALIST . SEE YOU IN 20 . I 'M A REALIST . SEE YOU IN 20 . CAPTAIN 'S PERSONAL JOURNAL , CONTINUED . OUR SEARCH FOR A CURE TO THE DRAKH PLAGUE HAS BROUGHT US TO A DEAD WORLD UNLIKE ANY WE 'VE SEEN BEFORE . IT 'S MORE THAN JUST THE STRANGE APPEARANCE OF THE BUILDINGS . WHOEVER LIVED HERE VANISHED CENTURIES AGO . BUT THE CITY IS STILL IN PERFECT SHAPE , AS IF THEY HAD NEVER DISAPPEARED . IT FEELS LIKE THE CITY IS WATCHING US . IT FEELS LIKE THE CITY IS WATCHING US . BUT , OF COURSE , THAT 'S NOT POSSIBLE . BUT , OF COURSE , THAT 'S NOT POSSIBLE . [ MECHANICAL HUM ] [ MECHANICAL HUM ] AAH ! AAH ! AAH ! MATTHEW GIDEON , CAPTAIN . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . TO FIND A CURE TO THE DRAKH PLAGUE BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . Questioner : WHO DO YOU SERVE ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? MR. EILERSON ... WHEN I LEFT HERE LAST NIGHT , YOU WERE WORKING ON THAT SAME HIEROGLYPH . I THOUGHT YOU WOULD 'VE MOVED ON BY NOW . WE 'VE GOT A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER . YOU DON 'T BECOME AN ARCHEOLOGIST BECAUSE YOU 'RE IN A HURRY , CAPTAIN . IT 'S A DISCIPLINE OF PATIENCE . AFTER WORKING NONSTOP FOR THE LAST 8 HOURS , I 'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRANSLATE MOST OF THIS SECTION . AS FAR AS I CAN TELL , ALL OF THESE ARE EQUATIONS . AS FAR AS I CAN TELL , ALL OF THESE ARE EQUATIONS . THIS ONE HERE DESCRIBES A WHOLE NEW MEANS FOR CREATING AND CONSERVING ENERGY . AND THAT ONE- - A NEW PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT WILL DOUBLE THE SPEEDS OF OUR CURRENT STARSHIPS . AND HERE--WAYS OF CREATING NEW ALLOYS THAT WEIGH ALMOST NOTHING AND CAN SUPPORT TONS . ANY MEDICAL INFORMATION ? NO . NOT YET . WHAT 'S MADDENING IS THAT ALL OF THESE CONTAIN ONLY THE FIRST PART OF THE FORMULA IN QUESTION . I 'M SURE THEY 'RE CONTINUED SOMEWHERE , BUT I 'LL BE DAMNED IF I CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE . I HAVE MY PEOPLE SEARCHING THE BUILDINGS FOR THIS PARTICULAR SEQUENCE . MR. EILERSON , WE ARE ON A CLOCK HERE . WE HAVE TO PUT FINDING A CURE TO THE DRAKH PLAGUE ABOVE ANY ... DISTRACTIONS . DISTRACTIONS ? [ CHUCKLES ] WOULDN 'T YOU LIKE TO GO BACK TO EARTH NOT ONLY AS THE SAVIOR OF MANKIND , BUT WITH A PATENT ON A SHINY NEW FUTURE ? THE MONEY TO BE MADE- - IS SECONDARY TO OUR MISSION . LOOK , WHEN INTERPLANETARY EXPEDITIONS HEARD THAT WE NEEDED A CRACK ARCHEOLOGIST AND LINGUIST , THEY GAVE US YOU . FAIR ENOUGH . YOU 'RE ONE OF THE BEST . BUT THIS ISN 'T ABOUT MAKING A PROFIT FOR IPX . IT 'S ABOUT ... SAVING HUMANITY . I DIDN 'T KNOW THE TWO WERE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE . OPEN YOUR MIND A LITTLE , CAPTAIN . I DID . DESPITE GROWING UP ON MARS UNDER THE HEEL OF EARTH OPPRESSION , I STILL WANT TO FIND A CURE FOR EARTH , ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU DO . IT 'S ... HUMANITARIAN . CHARITABLE . NOBLESSE OBLIGE . IT 'S SOMETHING- - GOOD FOR YOUR REPUTATION . GOOD P.R. GOOD BUSINESS IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE . IPX IS A MULTIPLANETARY CORPORATION , WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE NEEDS . BUT OUT OF CALAMITY COMES OPPORTUNITY . NATIONS RISE AND FALL , PLANETS LIVE AND DIE , BUT CORPORATIONS GO ON AND ON THROUGH GOOD TIMES AND BAD , BECAUSE IT 'S ALL ABOUT PROFIT . BECAUSE IT 'S ALL ABOUT PROFIT . Woman : CAPTAIN , IN HERE . Woman : CAPTAIN , IN HERE . YOUR COMMISSION CAN WAIT . IF YOU FIND ANY FORMULAS THAT RELATE TO THE MEDICAL INFORMATION THAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR , I 'LL TURN THIS PLACE UPSIDE DOWN TO HELP YOU FIND THE REST OF THEM . UNTIL THEN , KEEP MOVING . UNTIL THEN , KEEP MOVING . SORRY TO DRAG YOU AWAY FROM THE KING OF THE PIG PEOPLE , BUT I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD SEE THIS . THESE ARE SOIL SAMPLES . WHEREVER WE GO , WE LEAVE MICROSCOPIC SKIN FLAKES BEHIND . TOO SMALL TO SEE , BUT CARRYING OUR DNA IMPRINT . SO FAR , I 'VE MADE OUT AT LEAST 30 DIFFERENT TYPES OF DNA IN SOIL SAMPLES GOING BACK 50 YEARS . IF WE 'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES TO FIND THIS PLACE , WHY IS EVERYTHING STILL INTACT ? USUALLY A RESOURCE LIKE THIS WOULD BE STRIPPED BARE . I DON 'T KNOW . AND ANOTHER THING- - THOSE HIEROGLYPHS MR. EILERSON FOUND- - WHY ARE THEY OUT IN THE OPEN LIKE THAT ? I PUT MY BOOKS ONA SHELF . I DON 'T TAKE THE PAGES AND TURN THEMINTO A SHELF . I DON 'T TAKE THE PAGES AND TURN THEMINTO A SHELF . COULD THIS PLACE HAVE BEEN SIMILAR TO THE LIBRARY AT ALEXANDRIA ? A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE USED BY VARIOUS RACES OVER THE CENTURIES ? NO . WE WOULD 'VE HEARD ABOUT IT BY NOW . AND WHY NO SIGN OF LONG-TERM EXCAVATIONS ? IT DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . ALL WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT THIS PLANET HAS BEEN DESERTED FOR AT LEAST 1,000 YEARS . AND THE ALIEN RACE THAT BUILT ALL THIS DISAPPEARED ALMOST OVERNIGHT . COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT BY THE SAME PLAGUE THAT HIT EARTH ? MAYBE . OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING CATACLYSMIC HAPPENED HERE . MAYBE . OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING CATACLYSMIC HAPPENED HERE . BUT IF IT WAS A PLAGUE , WHERE ARE ALL THE BODIES ? THERE SHOULD BE SOME SIGN OF THEM . IT DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . IT DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . TOO BAD GALEN 'S NOT HERE . HE MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEAS . IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE EASIER IF HE COULD STAY CLOSER TO HOME INSTEAD OF FLITTING OFF AT EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY . HE 'S A TECHNOMAGE . THEY 'RE LIKE THAT . HE APPEARS WHEN YOU WANT HIM LEAST AND NEED HIM MOST . BY THE WAY , WHERE 'S DUREENA ? I DIDN 'T SEE HER ON MY WAY IN . OH , WE 'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING INTO SOME OF THE OTHER VAULTS , SO I ASKED OUR RESIDENT THIEF AND TUNNEL RAT IF SHE COULD FIND A WAY IN . DID SHE ? I DON 'T KNOW . WHEN I LOOKED BACK , SHE WAS GONE , AND THERE WAS A DUREENA-SIZED HOLE IN THE GROUND . AND THERE WAS A DUREENA-SIZED HOLE IN THE GROUND . AHH ... ANOTHER ONE . AHH ... ANOTHER ONE . [ COMMUNICATOR BEEPS ] YEAH ? Gideon : DUREENA , YOU BETTER GET UP HERE . BUT I JUST FOUND- - IT CAN WAIT . ONE OF THE CREW 'S BEEN MURDERED . ONE OF THE CREW 'S BEEN MURDERED .

THE CAPTAIN 'S ON SITE . THE DOCTOR 'S WITH HIM . THE CAPTAIN 'S ON SITE . THE DOCTOR 'S WITH HIM . YOU FOUND THE BODY ? YES , SIR . NOBODY SAW OR HEARD ANYTHING , AND THE ONLY FOOTPRINTS WE FOUND BELONG TO THE VICTIM . FOOTPRINTS AREN 'T ALL THAT 'S MISSING HERE . HE WASN 'T JUST KILLED . HE WAS GUTTED . NEARLY ALL HIS INTERNAL ORGANS ARE MISSING . MR. EILERSON , WHEN WE DID OUR PRELIMINARY SCAN OF THIS PLANET , YOU TOLD ME THIS PLACE WAS DESERTED . NO SIGN OF LIFE AT ALL . THAT 'S CORRECT . THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS ? CLEARLY , DR. CHAMBERS ' PEOPLE GAVE ME BAD INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE MY ANALYSIS . GARBAGE IN , GARBAGE OUT . JUST A MINUTE- - [ BEEP BEEP ] YES ? EXCALIBURHERE , CAPTAIN . WE 'RE GETTING MOVEMENT IN YOUR SECTOR . IDENTIFY . UNKNOWN . BUT WHATEVER IT IS , IT 'S HEADING YOUR WAY , AND IT 'S DEFINITELY NOT US . AND IT 'S DEFINITELY NOT US . I DON 'T THINK THEY 'VE SEEN US YET . I DON 'T THINK THEY 'VE SEEN US YET . GET TO THE SHUTTLE AND TAKE OFF . TELL THE OTHERS TO GET BACK TO THE SHIP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . I 'LL CATCH UP LATER . WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? TO BUYYOUSOME TIME . NOW MOVE IT . NOW MOVE IT . HEY ! OVER HERE ! OVER HERE ! Galen : I WANT YOU TO KNOW , MATTHEW , I HEARD THAT BIT ABOUT MY ONLY SHOWING UP WHEN I 'M MOST NEEDED AND LEAST WANTED . GOOD THING FOR YOU I DON 'T HOLD A GRUDGE . Gideon : YES , YOU DO .

AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL , ALL ACTIVITY ON THE PLANET STOPPED AS SOON AS YOU LEFT . FOR THE TIME BEING , AT LEAST , IT APPEARS WE 'RE SAFE UP HERE . NO SIGN OF LIFE DOWN THERE ? WE 'RE RUNNING THE SCANNERS AT MAXIMUM , PROBING TO A DEPTH OF A HALF A MILE . SO FAR , NOTHING . WELL , THERE 'S SOMETHING DOWN THERE , LIEUTENANT . THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF AUTOMATIC DEFENSE SYSTEM . AN A.D.S. IS DESIGNED TO KEEP YOU FROM LANDING . IT 'S BEEN QUIET FOR 2 FULL DAYS . NOW THIS . [ SIGHS ] ANY THOUGHTS , GALEN ? HMM ? OH , SORRY . I WAS JUST TRYING TO WORK OUT WHETHER A COMMENT FROM ME RIGHT NOW WOULD BE " MOST WANTED " OR " LEAST NEEDED . " I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUDON 'THOLD A GRUDGE . I DON 'T . I HAVE NO SURVIVING ENEMIES ... AT ALL . AT ALL . SHOULD WE BREAK ORBIT ? NEGATIVE . WHATEVER 'S DOWN THERE KILLED AT LEAST ONE OF OUR PEOPLE . WE 'RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL I KNOW HOW AND WHY SO THE SAME THING DOESN 'T HAPPEN TO THE NEXT SHIP TO COME THIS WAY . I HAVE TO SAY I AGREE . THERE 'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE DATA DOWN THERE , AND IF WE LEAVE NOW , WE LOSE EVERYTHING . MAX , WE DON 'THAVE ANYTHING . YOU SAID YOU WERE ONLY ABLE TO FIND PARTIAL INFORMATION . EXACTLY MY POINT . I SAY WE FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND TAKE CARE OF IT . I BELIEVE THAT BLOWING IT UP IS THE USUAL SOLUTION TO THESE THINGS . AND THEN WE GO BACK FOR THE REST . AND WE AVENGE THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF CREWMAN ... AND WE AVENGE THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF CREWMAN ... VARELLI . VARELLI . VIVISECTED . TERRIBLE WAY TO DIE . WE HAVE TO HAVE OUR PRIORITIES , AFTER ALL . DID YOU SAY ... VIVISECTED ? YES . NEARLY ALL HIS INTERNAL ORGANS WERE MISSING . NOW , THAT IS INTERESTING . NOW , THAT IS INTERESTING . WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? I JUST NEED TO GET SOMETHING FROM MY SHIP . I JUST NEED TO GET SOMETHING FROM MY SHIP . WHY DO I ALWAYS GET NERVOUS WHEN HE SAYS THAT ? WHY DO I ALWAYS GET NERVOUS WHEN HE SAYS THAT ? WHERE 'S DUREENA ? WHERE 'S DUREENA ? FLIGHT DECK . FLIGHT DECK . THE ANSWER IS STILL NO . THE ANSWER IS STILL NO . I DIDN 'T SAY ANYTHING . THAT WAS THE LOOK YOU GAVE ME THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED ME TO TEACH YOU WHAT I KNOW . THE ANSWER WAS NO THEN , AND IT IS NO NOW . WHY ? BECAUSE THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING , AND RIGHT NOW IS THE WRONG TIME . YOU WANT TO LEARN FOR THE WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE REASONS- - THE NEED FOR REVENGE . THE NEED FOR REVENGE . THE DRAKH KILLED MY ENTIRE RACE . NOW , THEY WILL DO THE SAME TO YOURS , TO ALL THE HUMANS WHO WERE ON EARTH WHEN THE PLAGUE WAS RELEASED , AND YOU DON 'T WANT REVENGE ? WHEN YOU HAVE REACHED THE END OF THE ROAD , THEN YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO GO TO THE LEFT OR TO THE RIGHT , TO FIRE OR TO WATER . IF YOU MAKE THOSE DECISIONS BEFORE YOU HAVE EVEN SET FOOT UPON THE ROAD ... IT WILL TAKE YOU NOWHERE . IT WILL TAKE YOU NOWHERE . EXCEPT TO A BAD END . EXCEPT TO A BAD END . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND .

THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE PARTIAL FORMULAS WRITTEN ON THE WALL , DISPLAYED RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN SO WE WERE SURE TO SEE THEM . THEY GAVE US JUST ENOUGH SO WE 'D STICK AROUND , BUT NEVER LETTING US HAVE THE WHOLE THING . CHEESE FOR THE MOUSETRAP . AND ALL THE WHILE , THEYWERE OBSERVINGUS , UNTIL THEY WERE READY TO SPRING THE TRAP . THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE DOZENS OF DNA SAMPLES I FOUND . AND THE BODIES . AND THE BODIES . WHAT BODIES ? THE ONES I FOUND UNDERGROUND . SOME WERE FAIRLY INTACT . OTHERS WERE JUST IN BITS AND PIECES . WELL , DOCTOR , YOU WERE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF THIS WORLD . THERE 'S YOUR ANSWER . NO . THESE BODIES WERE ALL DIFFERENT . NO TWO ALIKE . THEY WERE VISITORS , SAME AS US . WHY DID YOU WAIT UNTIL NOW TO MENTION THIS ? OH . BECAUSE THERE IS A RIGHT TIME AND A WRONG TIME FOR EVERYTHING . I WAS JUST WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME . I WAS JUST WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME .

AS THOUGH WE WERE ALREADY DEAD . THEN YOU ENCOUNTERED THE SAME VIRUS THAT HIT OUR WORLD . YES . THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU .

YOU ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A CURE . WE STRUGGLED FOR 3 YEARS TO DEFEAT THE PLAGUE , AND FAILED . WE HAD FEW SHIPS CAPABLE OF STAR FLIGHT , NOT ENOUGH TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOROURCURE , AS YOU ARE DOING . SO WE ... WENT TO SLEEP . THOSE MUST HAVE BEEN THE CRYONIC TUBES THAT WE SAW ON THE SCANNERS . BY FREEZING AN INFECTED PERSON , YOU FREEZE THE VIRUS SO IT CAN 'T ADVANCE UNTIL YOU THAW IT OUT AGAIN .

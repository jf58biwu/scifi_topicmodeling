 Previously on The Pretender . - Who am I ? Was I bought ? Stolen ? Where are my mom and dad ? This is my mother . - Yes , it is . His name is Angelo . Someone who can absorb the intellectual , - I want to know what happened to my mother . - I killed her . That 's what I torture myself believing . Raines is a dangerous man . He may be involved with the murder of Miss Parker 's mother . - I fantasize about killing him . Special agent , Jarod Ness . Welcome abord . The escapee is a John Doe , he was convicted for his violent felonies , that ended in the kidnapping of Harriet Tashman . Mom ... He 's name is Kyle , and he was part of the Preteder program years ago ... under the direction , of an Dr. Raines , I decide who lives or dies . He was teaching him to hate me more . to shoot my mother . Now , I decide who lives or dies . Not this time . Witch one ? Get Kyle ! Why did you stop me from shooting him ? Kyle is your brother . I don 't remember my parents or anything about having a brother . Well , you were very young when you were taken . We often repress , forget . How did they come to be with you ? Well , my own parents were killed three weeks before my 11 th birthday . I grew up in a convent , content to give my life serving the church as a nun . I had said my vows and was cloistered for years . - But it didn 't take . - Was my family tied to the convent ? No , no . There was another girl . Catherine Jamison . I slipped in . I was drowning . Catherine dove in , dragged me out and then breathed life back into me . She never became a nun , but the spirit that glowed in her ... was something I 've been unable to achieve despite years of prayer . Then after she left the convent , she married a man by the name of ... Catherine Parker . - Did you know her ? - Her daughter . What did she have to do with my parents ? Well , in 1969 , the year I inherited this farm ... Mother Superior called and said Catherine needed help . Catherine showed up and asked me to shelter a man and a woman ... who had had their two young sons abducted . Is that when my parents came here ? I knew them as Charles and Margaret . They were afraid . It was safe here . Thwy were wonderful people . Jarod . You would be very proud of them . Did they ever talk or ask about me or my brother ? They never talked . I never asked . It was too painful . Especially for your father . It was clear how deeply he missed his sons . Did they ever say who they thought might 've taken us ? I think your father was afraid it would affect your mother 's health . - The baby . - She gave birth to a little girl a month later . - I have a sister . - Her name is Emily . There are no pictures . I 'm sorry . Years later , I started getting threatening phone calls and letters from Kyle . He must 've figured out I had some tie to your parents . Of course , I had no idea at the time ... He was desperate . He thought I could help him . It was after the kidnapping that your family vanished . You 've been hiding here ever since . I knew Kyle was in prison , but I also know the debt of his anger ... his suffering . I 'd lost contact with Catherine Parker years earlier . I felt alone , and I was afraid . So I went underground . Your parents loved you , Jarod . They loved and they missed you and your brother . Do you remember where you first lived when you came to the Centre ? At first , three doors down from the corridor entrance . - Later , sublevel ... - What was the Manchester Solution ? The Manchester Solution . I don 't remember any solution because the job was blown . - I could 've done it alone . I simmed it correct ... The others lost the will , but I didn 't . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies . You said after all those years in prison , he 'd remember nothing . - He can 't remember everything . I brought him in . Why is he here ? - I asked him to be . - Who in the hell is Kyle anyway ? Or should I say what ? Kyle is someone of concern to me . You missed Jarod . It was your best chance , and he 's still out there . I know you 're upset . I should 've told you that I had brought Mr. Raines in on this . I apologize . But things were moving quickly . Now Mr. Raines and I will handle Kyle . - But , Daddy ... - No , no , no . Trust me . Sydney , do you think Jarod might return to the Centre ? There 's nothing here that Jarod wants . And Jarod always has an objective . Besides , even though we never figured out how he got out ... our latest security improvements are quite beyond anyone 's capabilities . Even Jarod 's . That 's the first time I have ever heard you doubt Jarod 's abilities . Let 's just hope they believed it as much as you did . Help , they 're comming ! - Get him out of here . - No ! Jarod , help ! No , leave me alone . Jarod , help me . ! You said it was a matter of great importance . I want you to help me get to Kyle . - Why ? - Because he knows something about my mother 's death . What do you want me to do ? Beg ? What makes you so certain that Kyle can help you ? Because he was Mr. Raines 's pet project . I feel it . Sydney , I feel it . Kyle knows who killed my mother . Look , they 're keeping him in a section I don 't have access to . Also , they 're monitoring him round the clock from the tech room . There 's just no way for anyone to get there undetected . - Right ? - Mmm , well , that 's not entirely true . What do you mean ? I mean , I got us into SL 27 , didn 't I ? I could probably bypass the sensors ... and at a designated time , loop the camera feed into the monitor system . Well , for how long ? Mmm , long enough . here . Oh , that 's hot ! I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Got it . You look just like her . That 's what they tell me . You 're the one who decides who lives or dies , right ? - You know my work . - Did you kill my mother ? - No . - Then who ? Was it Mr. Raines ? What are you doing here ? I was trying to find my way to the , uh , new accounting offices . Why do I think you 're lying ? Open the door . Get him out of here . My parents must have loved this place . I may know someone ... who can help you find what you 're looking for . Who ? Solemn vows die hard . I 'll have to go and see them . Alone . It 's too dangerous . Catherine didn 't think of herself when she pulled me out of that icy pond . I 'll be ... I 'll be gone a few days . I won 't be here . I 've spent every moment since I broke out ... searching and hunting for some clue that might lead me to my past . And right now , the biggest clue to it is back where I started . I don 't understand . I 'm going to get my brother . I 'm going back to the Centre . My God . How 'd you get in ? The same way I got out . Why didn 't you tell me about my family ? About my brother ? - Your brother ? Kyle . At least that 's what I think his name is . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - I didn 't know . That 's interesting . That what you allways say . I swear to you , Jarod . All I know about Kyle is ... actually , what Jacob told me . Am I interrupting something ? Oh . Just going over some notes . Of course . Always the conscientious one . You will notify me if Jarod attempts to make contact with you . What if he contacts you first ? Jarod , help me ! Look at your hair . Cracker Jack ... C.J. You 're C.J. You wrote those letters to Kyle in prison . You 've been in contact with him just like you 've been in contact with me . It 's been a long time since we 've had to perform ... this kind of a radical procedure , Dr. Raines . And the Tower hasn 't made their approval clear yet . I 've made the diagnosis . A frontal lobe separation is the only way to bring him peace . Unless you 'd like to offer a differing opinion . - I 'll call for anesthesia . He 'll be ready in 10 minutes . Who the hell are you ? I 'm Jarod . Raines said you were dead . Not hardly . Why are you helping me ? Because ... I 'm your brother . - I don 't have any family . - Yes . You do . I 'm guessing ... our father gave you this . My God . - You kept it . - Not me . He did . Come on . It 's time we all were free . Nobody gets hurt . Where are we going ? Home . Angelo , come on . Get in . I decide who lives or dies . How did this happen ? Alarm sensors indicate they 're in SL 19 . I 'm on it . I need to speak to Mr. Parker . - This way . - Where does it lead ? Out . Come on . We 're on 19 . Broots , where are they ? I 'm working on it . I 'm working on it . - Go down to 20 . Miss Parker , I 'm getting a signal in the motion detectors . They 're in the ventilation system . Right where you are . Rip that down . Damn it . It 's Cousin Itt . It 's Angelo . Trust me . Tell me this wasn 't you , Daddy . I did not authorize this procedure . I would never do that . Raines was prepared to destroy a Centre investment ... with no directive from the Tower ... to protect himself from what Kyle knows . We 've both been feeling it for a long time . Raines has had his own agenda long enough . He 'll be dealt with . Just bring me back what belongs to the Centre . - It 's okay . Here . It 's one of the small joys of freedom . There 's candy underneath the head . That 's okay . I have plenty more . We just gonna drive ? I know a place where we can rest . The truth is ... the running never stops . How long you been out ? Almost a year now . There 's so much out here . You have so much catching up to do . You do remember . That Kyle was a million years ago , Jarod . By the time I broke from the Centre , my head was mush . All I thought about was finding my ... finding our parents . And anybody got in my way , I just ran over ' em . Before long , I was running from the law . By the time I figured things out and got to Harriet ... I never wanted to hurt her . I just thought she knew where they were . Something good came out of it . At least we have a place to start . Well , that 's the rest of it . He 's gone through everything we have . Jarod 's notebooks , F.B.I. files , everything we 've got on Kyle . Real glutton for punishment , hmm ? Desperate times , desperate measures , Sydney . If Sponge Boy here really can become anyone , then I 'm letting him become Kyle and Jarod at the same time . Maybe he 'll tell me where they went . Maybe we should have tethered him . Aren 't we making one erroneous assumption , - Dr Parker ? What 's he gonna blow ? A transistor ? - You assume that he wants to help you . - Why wouldn 't he ? Just let this quack handle it , hmm ? Jarod . If you 're really in there , Jarod ... then you 'll know who I am ... and that I can help you . Also , that I am the only one ... who can protect you from Mr. Raines . I 'm going home . I 'm safe here . Kyle kidnapped a woman named Harriet Tashman . He was trying to get her to this place . I can feel them here . I know . But they don 't have faces . 'Cause we don 't remember . Or the Centre didn 't let us remember . Maybe this will help . She 's beautiful . They 're still out there , aren 't they ? Yes . Them ... and our sister . She was born after we were gone . Dad taught me . We 're going to find them . We wouldn 't have gotten this far unless we were meant to . Korkos ! Do you want to know where John Doe is ? We didn 't know it was you . It 's all right . We all want the same thing . I have some good news . Somebody 's coming up the road . Let 's get out of here . Get ' em . - Hold still . Let me look . - No . Go . My leg is broken . No . I 'm not going to leave you here . Jarod , go ! Find our parents . Don 't tell them what I became . Come on , Jarod . Freeze . F.B.I. - Jarod , we have to split up . - No . Come on . I can protect you . No . This is not about me now . Your parents . They 're in Boston . They 'll arrive by taxi at this coffee shop . My parents , have you seen them , are they OK ? Here 's the address and meet time . Tomorrow at 3 : 00 . Harriet , thank you . It was a prudent move with Kyle . Keeps our hands clean . I think we should focus on bringing Jarod in . - Where ? When ? - 3 : 00 . Today . Take a Sweeper team with you . Bring him back . - We 're flying blind . - No need , Miss Parker . - Well , don 't count on Mr. Raines feeling the same way . - I don 't . Well , let me show you how to take off the safety , huh ? I don 't want Jarod hurt . Do my best , Syd . - It 's hot and good to go . You take the east . Got that ? You take the west . I 'll float . Hello , Jarod . You stole me from my parents . You had the F.B.I. kill my brother . And now you 're trying to kill my family . What have I ever done to you ? You exist . I 'm not gonna let you do to me what you did to my brother . You leave me alone . I thought he gave up smoking . No . No , no , no . There was no plant . The information on Jarod 's rendezvous with his parents ... came from a phone tap we 've had on St. Catherine 's for over 30 years . Yes , Mr. Lyle . You want me to come in ? What for ? Let 's talk now . Whatever you say . I 'll be with you shortly . We will . You have my word . Thank ... Ah . Glad you 're here . - Really ? - Of course . We have work to do . We ? Now that Raines is in doctors ' hands ... or God 's . Skin grafts can be so demanding . Well , at least he 'll be out of your hair . Isn 't that what you wanted ? - - Is that what you wanted ? - He overstepped . I dealt with him as promised . Then why was he out on that street yesterday ? Why did he know right where Jarod would be ? Difficult for a man like Raines to end up in hospital ... while sitting behind his desk , don 't you think ? You promised me that we would talk . Did Raines kill Mother ? Honey . There are no easy answers . - Yes or no . Did he kill her ? There are still great repercussions from your mother 's death . When I can tell you more , I will . - Trust me . Ah , you 're here to escort me ? Of course you are . A friend of mine in cleanup sent me this . - Ballistics report ? - What the hell 's going on here ? - I don 't follow . Well , the bullet that struck the oxygen tank ... They can 't tell which gun it was fired from . Hello . This is Sydney . Hello . Who 's there ? I may be tired , Sydney ... but I 'll never give up . I don 't expect you to . I 'll find them again . No one is going to keep me from my family . I understand . Jarod , you were closer to your family than I ever was . I want you to believe that . If it 's my faith you want ... tell me where they buried my brother . - Buried him ? - Kyle . Yes . - Tell me , Sydney . The van 's gas tank was full . It burned for a very long time . No remains were found . Nothing . Nada . Which is , yet again , what you leave me with . Are you still there ? I 'm here . With everything that 's happened ... they 're more determined than ever to find you . Do you know where you 'll go ? I have a good idea . Catch me if you can .

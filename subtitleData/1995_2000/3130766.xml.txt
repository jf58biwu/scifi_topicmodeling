Your wife is on line one . Sean ! A jet was just chartered . Anderson Airfield . Guess who paid the bill in cash ? Pollux Troy . - Put one of our people on that plane . - Wait ! We still got no sign of Castor ! Pollux doesn 't fly without Big Brother . Now come on ! right ? I told you goddam Dietrich would try to pawn off some ... cheap-shit North Korean plastic . Casing fit like a condom . Pollux ? how long did you want me to sit here twiddling my thumbs ? I paid for the jet . Save us some time . to hide our famous faces . bro . I hate it when you call me bro . including himself . smoggy . my passengers are here . I gotta go . Let 's go . Let 's go . I 'm bored . Let 's go . - Here you go . - Bravo . Would you like anything else once we 're airborne ? a peach . Sit . Come here . eat a peach for hours . come here . uh ... wait . Let me rephrase . would you be grateful ? There 's someone on the runway . Get off of me ! - Archer . - FBI ! This is a very big gun . Fly the fuckin ' plane ! Come on . That 's it . - Come on . Let 's go ! - Goddam it . Don 't play chicken with a goddam jet ! Come on . Sean ! pin ' em in ! Close in on ' em ! Sean ? Shit ! go ! Sean ! Take off now . - Fly ! - I can 't ! bitch ! locked and ready . Follow Archer 's lead . What the fuck are you doing ? There 's an engine out . We gotta stop . move ! - Get back ! Back up ! Pollux ! - Cas ! - Get over here . Back him to me . Back him to me . He 's mine ! Cas . Secure the hangar . down ! Down ! Castor . Your time 's up . 'cause you only got one bullet left . So do you . Wow . We 've got something in common . We both know our guns . and you do . that hurts . Sean ? Why don 't you come with us ? Try terrorism for hire ? - We 'll blow some shit up . It 's more fun . - Shut the fuck up . You watch your fuckin ' mouth ! but I 'll give this shithole a break if my brother and I walk . I see . Y-You think I 'm bluffing . maybe I 'm not . what would you do with me locked up ? You 'd drive your wife and kid crazy . anyway ? Is she ripening by now ? your little peach ? Is she ripe ? Okay . O-Okay . don 't shoot me . Seanie ! because I don 't give a fuck ! I 'm ready baby looks like Elvis done left the buildin ' . It wasn 't my fault . Why won 't you ever be on my side ? but you have to give me a chance ... Now what ? She was suspended again . Some kid made a crack about her clothes ... Dad . Don 't even ask me what happened . Okay . What happened ? I see . - Not like you would believe me anyway . okay ? loo ...

How 's Loomis ? he 'll be okay . - What 's up ? - Special ops . They want a word . forget it . I don 't have the time . Sean . Recovered from the jet wreckage . Found in Pollux Troy 's briefcase . Porcelain casing . Thermal cloak . Nerve gas and biological payload . It 's enough to flatten a square mile . the fallout 'll be a tad worse than Gulf War syndrome . A biblical ... A biblical plague to LA . Where is he ? Where is Pollux Troy ? Why draw the schematic if you 're not gonna build the bomb ? is it now a crime in this country to exercise the mind ? - I 'm interested in bomb ... - I won 't say another word until I see my brother . Any progress ? give it a rest . You got Castor . Just go home . we 're not gonna evacuate the city on your hunch . I know Castor too well for this to be a hunch . just-just run the goddam bureau any way you like . I could put an agent in his cell . Maybe Pollux will let it slip . come on . He 's a paranoid sociopath . and he 's dead . There is one other possibility . God . You 're keeping him alive . Archer . He 's a turnip . Oh . What if you could walk into Erewhon Prison ... big brotherly hug as Castor Troy ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . Let me try . Malcolm Walsh . - I run the bio-cover unit for special ops . - I know who you are . - But you don 't know what I can do . - Uh ... Physical alteration . Augmentation . even the voice of a government witness . I think you 'll recognize this patient . We had to build your friend Loomis a whole new ear from scratch . just a temporary trade . Come here . not weeks . but Pollux won 't know that . Height difference is negligible . eye pigment : both almost identical . microplugs for body hair . love handles . But all that 's the easy part . Here 's the real science . morphogenetic template . the outside exactly like Troy 's . but the real thing . tear ducts and nerve endings . you wanna take his face and mine ... - Borrow . The procedure 's completely reversible . Y-You think that I want to do this ? Sean . - No ! - You have lived and breathed Castor Troy for years . I 'll get his gang to talk . That 's what I do . and Castor Troy will win . Get out . Go ahead . Wipe your ass . what the hell is that smell ? He shit in his pants . Where 's Dietrich ? Sasha . When was the last time you saw Castor Troy ? - Who cares ? He 's dead . - Answer the question . I know my rights . I don 't have to answer shit . but know this : You 're a convicted felon on probation for harbouring Castor Troy . and your son will end up in a foster home . I understand why you would use such a threat . I swear to you ... I haven 't seen him for years . This reeks of you . It 's got your signature all over it . but you ain 't got nothin on me and you know it . or I can talk to your sister again . She 's right outside . Only this time I 'll be nice . how 's your dead son ? but that 's all I know . Great . So we got a date . Now where the hell 's the damn bomb ? Only Pollux Troy 'll know that . Sean . this is a black bag operation . and you can 't tell your wife . God . let 's see . risk my neck . And you 're asking me to put in the dark all the people ... that love me ... and trust me . I 'll do it . Sean . Sorry I woke you . I 'm glad it 's you that woke me . And not a phone call telling me you won 't be coming home . huh ? Sean . It 's okay . I keep ... I keep wanting to move this ... you know ? Mikey 'd be alive . And you wouldn 't be . things are gonna get better now that you 're home . but it will heal if you let it . Everything will be better now that he is forever out of our lives . if I told you that I realize that ... that this thing won 't fully end ... u-until I did one last thing ... something vital . Okay ... I ... You 're going back on assignment again . This one last time . Eve . that 's what you told me . Oh . Sean . You never have . So go . But go now . I changed my mind . This is a suicide mission . I know . uh ... this doctor ... if he ... if he ... I don 't know . be in control . That 's the part that scares me . something ... I have this scar ... that ... that ... after all this is over ... It ... It 's important to me . It 's ... It 's like a reminder . Sure . hold this for me . Please . Okay . Let 's go . G ... my God . Sean . Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuck you ! - Sean ! Sean ! - Fuck you ! come on . Sit down . Sit down . Sit down . Sean ! Sean ! Archer ! You 're Sean Archer . Sean Archer . Sean Archer . I want you to take this face ... and burn it . Hey . I still sound like me . but you 'll have to be careful . even a violent sneeze could dislodge it . - Just repeat what you hear . - Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . There 's a scratchy tickle . Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . - Once again . - Peach . I can eat a peach for hours . six days until the 18th . and so is the bomb . You got two days to get Pollux to talk . pulls you out . You got me ? - What 's the matter ? - Face itches . You all right ? Come on . Let 's go . Archer 's gonna be pissed when he comes back from his training op and finds out . The guy is knee-deep in Georgia swamp . a citizen of nowhere . The Geneva Convention is void here . Amnesty International doesn 't know we exist . I mean exactly that . This entire prison 's one big magnetic field . The boots tell us where you are . 621 to Population ! pal ? Don 't you remember the little people ? yeah . I bust ... believe Sean Archer busted you for stalking ' the UN Secretary General . no . Archer framed me . I ain 't had nothin ' to do with that . No ... Word was you got wasted . little man ? Pollux . Yeah ! there 's a disturbance in the population . - Go to lockdown . - Hold that lockdown . you pussy ! You watch your fuckin ' mouth . You watch your fuckin ' mouth ! 'Cause I 'm Castor Troy ! Yeah ! I 'm Castor Troy ! - Castor ! Castor ! - I 'm Castor Troy ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Lock ' em down . not you . you know where you 're goin ' . - When I get out of here ... - If you get out of here ... I 'm gonna have you fired . it 's me . Believe it . Someone ... They took ... switched my ... wh ... F ... Some fucking ... But it 's cool . We 're gonna deal with it . we 're gonna deal with it . - What 's this about ? - Dr Walsh . enjoying some of your greatest hits here . I partook ... uh ... your groovy painkillers . bravo . Bra-fucking-vo . God . This is excellent . Bravo . - Bravo . - What do you want ? Take one goddam guess . I wish they 'd play some of those salmon spawning scenes again . I found them intensely erotic . Fuckin ' nature channel . I 'm gonna foam at the mouth . It 's like they 're begging us to riot . Excuse me . are you ? you gotta help me . I am so fried . we 're both gonna be dead meat . Shock treatment ? What 's the matter with you ? Did they operate ? you 're still so fuckin ' paranoid . Aren 't they giving you your medication in here ? What was my medication ? I hand-fed you those pills for years . Vivex . I haven 't forgotten that . It 's just everything else . It 's ... my memory . It 's like a tab of bad Quantrex . I don 't even know why that fucking Yeti jumped me yesterday . Dubov ? You had a sex sandwich with his wife and his sister the night he was sent here . I guess that explains why he 's so upset . Wow . bro . Ain 't it cool ? why don 't you ? and now those militia nutjobs get to keep their cash . It 's so fucking unfair . That bomb you built does deserve an audience . It 's a work of art . It belongs in the Louvre . well . I guess the LA Convention Centre 'll have to do . - What ? - Thank you . For what ? You are so fucking pathetic . You got a visitor . you good-lookin ' . You 're hot ! only not . okay ? - But you were ... - In a coma ? Nothing like having your face cut off to disturb your sleep . Read the newspaper lately ? huh ? if a face-lift costs five grand ...

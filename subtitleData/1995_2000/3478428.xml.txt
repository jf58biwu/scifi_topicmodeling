 Yale - [ Static ] More tragedy struck the Yale series tutor program today . A Yale unit took its own life , and another had to be - [ Yale ] Stop playback . [ Distorted ] Stop playback . [ Distorted ] Experts believe the breakdowns occur - memory blocks fail . The Yale inductees experienced their criminal pasts . [ Groaning ] Why don 't you give that a rest for a little while ? [ Bess ] Morgan . Well , it 's just that whatever he keeps replaying gets him more and more upset . Not to mention me . If I could control it , don 't you think I would ? Yale . Oh , my God ! What happened to your hand ? Stay back . Stay back ! But look . No wonder the command controls don 't work . Don 't ! [ Screams , Gasps ] Bess ! She was trying to help , you freak ! I told her ! I told both of you ! I have no idea what I 'm capable of ! . [ Morgan Narrating ] Things looked bad , and I had only myself to blame . After 68 days on the planet , I wasn 't getting any better at living here . I was trying . Really I was . But everything is different here . Nothing quite happens the way you 'd expect . G889 was supposed to have been Eden . Uninhabited , ready for the taking . But even in the short time since the crash , we 'd managed to find a good number of obstacles - some intelligent , some dangerous , all a surprise . Our own kind had , of course , outdone us . The Council had long ago decided ... to test the survivability of this planet with penal colonists . There are signs it 's not beyond the realm of possibility . Terrians had actually raised an orphaned human girl ... and , in our case , healed the first Syndrome child to reach the planet . But the gains we make are fragile . There are times the dark secrets of this planet pale ... compared to what we carry within us . Conflicting political backgrounds rip at our unity . A system tutor remembers his criminal past , and it drives him to the brink of madness . And for some , the pull of the endless horizon , the boundless possibilities , drive us to thoughts of greed and avarice . Maybe it was this that made me crave something to hold on to . Maybe that 's why I thought I had to own that heat-giving mineral , to stake a claim to a better future . I decided to lock up a kilometer of this planet for my own . It was a mistake . Not only did I petrify a Terrian , but I shook the balance between the Terrians and their planet . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Now I can 't undo it . I can 't unfreeze that Terrian , because I don 't have the right code . The damage is done , and Bess and I will have to live with it . Or die with it , as the case will probably be . [ Danziger ] If this is what it did to the perimeter monitor , then we 're lucky . That geolock came within a hundred meters of petrifying the entire camp . Lucky ? Have you looked at the land ? We better hope Morgan has a code to release the lock . If he 's alive . If any of them escaped the lock . Okay , well , we 'll send out search parties at dawn . In the meantime , let 's search that Martin tent , find that release code . [ Walman ] Camp alert . ! Camp alert . ! We got intruders . ! Mary . ! [ Trilling ] We 're so sorry . We know an awful accident has happened . [ Trilling ] What did she say ? They shared their sun stone with us , and in return we crippled a vital part of their mother . That 's what they called the earth . We are trying to reverse the lock . We didn 't know they were your stones . Zero , collect the stones that we have and bring them back here , please , quickly . We will give them back to you . Devon , that 's not all . When the lock was activated , we killed one of their tribe too . [ Terrians Growling ] We 're sorry . We want to make this right . How can we make this right ? [ Low Moaning ] Let me try to dream with them . Okay . [ Muttering ] It 's not - It 's not working . It 's like the dream plane 's broken . Your machine hurt the dreaming . How ? The machine belonged to two of our crew . We 'll hold them responsible . Three . And we hold them . What do you mean , you hold them ? [ Devon ] You have three ? They have Yale . [ Terrians Trilling ] Wait . Let 's talk about this now . Let 's talk about this . Wait ! Mary , you can 't do this . You have to give us a chance . ! What did they say ? At sunrise , the three who hurt the earth ... will go into the earth . They 're all gonna die . They 're all gonna die . Here we go . [ Shouting , Screaming ] - [ Screams ] - [ Man ] Come on . ! Get over there . ! Get over there . ! Move . ! Move . ! Move . ! - [ Screaming Continues ] - [ Man ] Come on . ! We ask for sanctuary under the Federal Agreement of Science . - We surrender . - [ Gasps , Panting ] It 's coming back , isn 't it ? You 're remembering who you were . Mary ! Thank God you 're here . Mary , what 's gonna happen to us ? Mary ? Well , you 're gonna get us out ofhere , right ? [ Morgan ] You explained it was all a mistake . You spoke to the Terrians , right ? We know your fate . What do you mean , our fate ? W-We have a fate ? How did that come about ? You killed . Well , now you 're going to kill us ? Mary , please . You can 't let that happen . Please . We can 't die . [ Whispering ] You must let them go . They are innocent . Morgan ? Morgan , are you there ? I can 't see . I can 't either , Bess . But I 'm right here beside you . Yale ? Yale , are you here ? Oh , my God . Morgan , where are they taking us ? I don 't know . I don 't know . Oh , Bess . Oh , God , Bess . Be strong . I think this is it . [ Both Gasping ] God , it 's horrible . So much death . But it is only one kilometer . I wonder why the Terrians are so worked up about it . Well , it 's a kilometer full of mineral veins that we don 't understand yet . But obviously Morgan has frozen a very vital part . Geolock , unlock freeze zone . [ Computer Voice ] Unauthorized command . Do not tamper with geolock . - Do not tamper with geolock . - Careful , Devon . - Ow ! - You okay ? Gave you a shock ? Yeah . That 's a hell of a protection system . [ Sighs ] How 's this thing work , Julia ? I 'd say that the canister contains a range of molecular decelerating factors ... that somehow combine in patterns to petrify the chosen area , but - So programmed in here is the exact counter-pattern that would unlock the area , right ? I guess , if you had the right code to release it . But , uh , we 've got exactly three hours and 52 minutes until dawn . About nine billion wrong codes to go through . Damn ! The Martins have more of these in their tent , right ? Think we could figure a way to set ' em off ? Maybe . Why ? We got four hours left . If we can 't impress the Terrians with our good intentions , maybe we can buy a few hours by threatening them . Wait a minute . You want to set off another geolock ? I 'm not saying that it 's the most diplomatic approach , but we are talkin about three lives here . Why don 't we let Alonzo try to reach the Terrians one more time ... before we turn this thing into Armageddon ? I agree . [ Echoing ] Hello ! Somebody ! You have to give us a chance ! Listen to me ! I 'm trying to stop a war ! Something is wrong in there . I couldn 't even speak . Whatever we did to their land , it ruined the dream plane . [ Whispering ] Come on . Let 's get - I can 't talk to them anymore . I just can 't . I 'm sorry . We got two hours . [ Danziger ] They won 't listen to reason . The only thing left is a threat . The problem with a threat is you have to be prepared to carry it through . Are you ready to petrify another kilometer of their land ? Are you ready to let the Terrians execute our people ? Do you have another idea , Devon ? I 'm ready to hear it ! Now is the time ! Julia , have you found out anything ? [ Sighs ] If locking up the land has damaged the dream plane , and if I 'm right , and the sun-stone veins are part of a planetary communication or nervous system , then maybe the vibrations that the rocks make ... are part of a language that we could learn . You mean a Terrian language ? The Terrians are part of it , but maybe it 's more . Maybe it 's the language of the planet . - And if you 're right ? - Well , I guess I 'm thinking ... if we could understand how the Terrians use the stones to communicate , we could fix the damage that we 've done with the geolock . That 's great . But we don 't have time for this ! [ Door Opens ] - [ Groaning ] - Oh , my God ! Morgan , Bess , are you guys all right ? We 're all right . We 're alive . What happened ? Where were you ? What happened ? [ Panting ] Mary . Mary is a saint . She saved us . Where is he ? What ? Where 's Yale ? What do you mean , where 's Yale ? He 's supposed to be with you . He was with us underground . But what happened to him ? Oh , my God , Morgan . That must be why they let us go . He must have traded himself for us . He must have told them that the geolock was all his fault . [ Sobbing ] Oh , my God . He saved us . [ Morgan ] He saved us . Then we have to save him . What 's the matter , Danziger ? Just a few minutes ago , you were ready to set off another canister . I 'm still willing to threaten the Terrians . But - But what ? We should just let Yale die ? Of course not , Devon . It 's just - He 's not exactly in stable condition . He was afraid ofhurting us . Maybe it 's what he wants . You have no idea what Yale wants . Do you ? Dev , ifhe 's asking to be killed - Yale would give his life for any one of you . Forgive me my sins , sins I can 't confess because I can 't remember . Show mercy on me ... as you have shown mercy on my victims . May the pain that they have felt at my hands be lifted from them . My last meal , I suppose . Thank you . Who were you talking to ? God . It 's a way of getting ready to die . To face one 's life and ask forgiveness ... for the harm that you have done . The Terrian way is better . - Don 't harm . - And don 't forgive . Mary , life isn 't that simple for humans . We struggle , we make mistakes , and we try to learn . We want to learn . It 's as basic as the need to eat . Like you . You ask questions ... because you want to learn . And before I die , I want the truth . So I talk to God . Terrians don 't talk to find truth . We listen . Be careful . That 's - [ Gasps ] [ Men Shouting ] - [ Woman Screams ] - [ Shouting Continues ] [ Man Screams ] [ Man ] Get inside . ! Everybody stay inside . ! No ! [ Panting ] I can 't . You don 't know ? You don 't know the release codes ? I told you they were impossible to decrypt . Just cracking the initiation code took forever . - Save it , Morgan . - I know . I know . I 'm a greedy fool . I never should 've - [ Magus ] John , grab your gear . It 's Devon . - Adair , where are you ? - I 'm in the tunnels . Alonzo 's with me . What ? Why ? Get back here ! We want to talk to the Terrians face-to-face . They will listen to reason . Get it through your head . This is a different species . They don 't think anything like we do ! Just hold off on using the geolock until I get back , okay ? - Adair , we 're gonna lose both of you . - Adair out . Baines , Walman , let 's go . I 'm coming with you . No ! You are staying here ! You have done enough already . Sit down ! - I want to help . - Sit ! Let 's go . If he tries to come , shoot him in the leg . All clear in there . How about you ? - [ Yale ] Nobody around . - Here 's the next one . You ready ? [ Yale ] I 'm ready . Let 's break it down . Okay , here we go . - One , two , three . - [ Screaming ] Here we go . [ Grunts ] Okay . Get that one ! Go ! Move ! Move ! Move ! - [ Screaming ] - Get off the ground ! Get outta here ! Come on ! Get the next one ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Get down ! Get down ! - [ Screaming ] - Sit down and shut up ! [ Distorted ] We ask for sanctuary - sanctuary - under the Federal Agreement of Science . - [ Indistinct ] - Please . We 're unarmed . We surrender . [ Distorted ] Please . We 're unarmed . [ Scientists Sobbing , Whimpering ] [ Grunts ] [ Man On Radio ] I heard weapon fire . You need any help ? Unit 3 , why don 't you answer ? Unit 3 , what 's happening ? - [ Yale ] All clear here . - Thank you . You saved our lives . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! There isn 't gonna be a court-martial , Croix . You 're just gonna disappear . Ever heard of the Yale program ? I am not a criminal . I 've saved lives . I will not die falsely accused ! I will not die ! Tier 1 at gamma by 5-2 . Ow ! Tier 1 at gamma by 5-1 . Ow ! My fingers are getting numb ! Morgan , let me try . Come on . I 'm partly to blame for this . Ooh ! No . You didn 't set off the geolock , Bess . I did . - Bess . - What ? I breached the first encryption tier . Morgan , there 's five more tiers to go , and this one took an hour . - Ow ! I can 't stop . - Wait a second . Why can 't you use your V.R. gear ? Come on . The geolock has remote radio reception . Yeah . It can read my thoughts ... a lot faster than I can type ' em . Okay . - It might not hurt as much . - Yeah . Okay . [ Beeping ] I 'm in . Tier 2 at beta by 9-9 . [ Electrical Buzz ] Oh . ! Well , it 's faster anyway . [ Morgan , Distorted ] Tier 2 at beta by 9-8 . Tier 2 at beta by 9-7 . [ Julia ] I 've got good news and bad news . The bad news is I don 't think I can fix whatever it is that we 've done down there . [ Devon ] The good news ? The good news is I think the minerals can . The stones are definitely tapped into some kind of intelligence . I 'm listening . I 've started communicating through the sun stones . But not because I learned their language . They learned mine . How do you know that ? I was trying to signal some basic syntax - just , you know , rudimentary English - and they sent back a language more complex than I 've ever seen before . So what are you thinking ? I 'm thinking that the Terrians are so furious ... not because we froze some extraneous nerve endings of the planet , but because we froze a significant portion of its cerebral cortex . Well , then how can it help us ? Well , it 's impaired , but it 's still powerful . It figured out the binary language of my scanner in minutes . I 'm wondering how long it would take to crack the geolock . Julia , if there 's any chance at all , do it . And hurry . [ Murmuring ] They 're ready to talk . Thank you for letting us speak . We wanted to talk to you before [ Trilling ] - She wants me to translate . - Why ? She can understand me . - She doesn 't want to carry our words . Tell them we understand we did a terrible thing , and we did not mean to harm them or their planet . All we need is some time . [ Sighs ] It 's really hard getting anything with the dreams , but ... I think they 're asking why . Because there is a chance we can undo the damage that was done . Mary , help me . Please . [ Trilling ] [ Terrians Trilling ] They 're saying if we don 't pay the price , it will happen again . It will not happen again . You have my word , and I 've kept my word before . [ Trilling ] [ Terrians Murmuring ] But you 're not speaking for all of us . They say Terrians think with one mind , but we think with many . You are not giving us a chance . We came here in good faith - - Tell ' em not to move ! - Danziger , what are you doing here ? Don 't shoot . ! John , please don 't . ! [ Terrians Murmuring ] Danziger , I 'm trying to get them to trust me . [ Alonzo ] Mary , they think we 're in danger . They 're our friends . These humans . It 's what she was talking about . They 'rejust trying to protect us . That 's all . John , put down the gun , please . How many hostages you want to give them , Adair ? John , listen to me . The only chance Yale 's got , the only chance any of us have ... is if we teach the Terrians to trust us . Look , I know you want to help . So , John , please help me ... by showing them that there 's a lot more to us than meets the eye . I hope you know what you 're talkin ' about . Okay , guys , let 's take a chance . See ? See , we can think with one mind . We do not need to lose lives to learn . I know you understand , Mary . Being human means seeing many sides . Make them see our side . You 'll be helping them too . Please . [ Trilling ] [ Terrians Murmuring ] - What are they saying ? - She 's trying to convince them . [ Trilling ] What 's happened ? Oh , my - [ Sighs ] Oh , great . [ Morgan 's Voice , Distorted ] [ Julia ] Morgan ? Bess ? Beta by 5-8 . Tier 2 at beta by 5-7 . You making any progress ? Yes . Barely . I think I can help . I don 't know . This geolock speaks a pretty complicated language . [ Sighs ] I 've got something that learns fast . - I have to talk to you . - This staff will stop you . Then you will go into the earth so no more hurt is done . Mary , I was ready to die before , but now I know the truth . Your earth has helped me find that truth . I don 't deserve to die ! - What do you want ? - I want to live ! Help me . Help me live . Why would I help ? Mary , everything that you know ... doesn 't come from these rocks . The truth is never that simple . I - Please , help me live . [ Groaning ] Oh ! No ! Not now ! [ Bess ] So how come it 's not decrypting any faster ? [ Julia ] All right . Let me see . The geolock is communicating with the scanner . The scanner 's communicating with the sun stones . I - - [ Beeping ] - I don 't know . So much for the smart rock theory . [ Sighs ] The two systems just don 't know how to interact . These encryption systems were designed by twisted minds . Otherwise , anyone with a hyper-net could crack them . So to get the two systems to understand each other - We need a twisted mind . [ Bess ] Morgan , no . Maybe it 's that simple . Uh , maybe all we need is an interface between the two systems ... to make them compatible . - [ Bess ] Morgan . ! - Oh . Your brain is not built to take this kind of stress . You could have a seizure . You know that . I got us into this . It 's almost dawn . [ Groaning , Grunting ] Tier 2 gamma 9-6 by theta 1 - 0-0-0 find 2-8 - [ Morgan 's Voice ] Searching , searching by delta tier 2 gamma 9-6 ... by theta 2-0-0-0 find 2-8 . Searching , searching for delta 2 - Mary ! You know this isn 't right ! You know it in your human heart . ! Help me live ! [ Morgan 's Voice ] Six by theta 3-0-0-0 find 2-8 . Searching - Tier 2 at gamma by 4-0-0 - [ Continues , Indistinct ] [ Bess ] It 's working . ! The numbers are flying . ! Oh , feeling woozy . [ Bess ] Julia , he 's out . What 's wrong ? No , he 's okay . He 's communicating unconsciously . Look . The numbers are still moving . Look . ! It worked . ! Morgan , you 've got two down and four to go . Only three more . [ Computer Voice ] Unlock code accepted . - Please enter countdown time . - Morgan ! - Please enter countdown time . - Bess ! Three seconds . Please enter zone size . One kilometer . - Lock-on selected . Are you certain ? - Yes . Go . Three , two . Commencing reaction . Look ! I don 't believe it . It worked . He did it ! [ Panting ] Morgan ? Morgan , did you hear that , honey ? Honey , you did it ! Did you hear that ? You broke the code . Morgan ? Morgan ? Morgan , honey ? [ Rumbling Sound ] What the hell is that ? It 's the geolock . Did you - Let 's go . [ Growling ] [ High-pitched Tone ] [ Gasps ] Oh , my God . He 's alive . Must 've reversed . Let 's get out of here . We have to get Yale . [ Danziger ] I hope we 're not too late . [ Gasps , Groaning ] [ Panting ] Thank you . Thank you , Mary . [ Panting ] Mary . I know we confuse you . But we can be friends . It-It 's frightening to go back to your buried past , but you have taught me it 's better to know . [ Rumbling ] Join us , Mary ! They have done all that they can do for you . You are not a Terrian . [ Rumbling ] Is that what you get for helping me ? You can 't travel through the earth anymore ? They won 't forgive you , Mary . It is not their way . Stay . Stay with us . [ Trilling ] Mary ! No ! Mary . ! Come back . ! No ! He 's all right . He 's coming around . Morgan ? Morgan , can you hear me ? [ Panting ] What happened ? Oh . Where am I ? Morgan , you broke the code . You did it . I broke the code ? Oh , Bess . The tree ! [ Laughs ] Oh ! Dirt . I love this planet . [ All Laughing ] [ Danziger ] Devon , you did the best you could . I 'm sorry . Mary . ! Mary , where are you ? [ Devon ] Yale ? You 're alive ? Much more than you think . Good morning . Morning . How are you ? Okay . Thanks . You 're welcome . [ Bess Laughing ] [ Indistinct Chattering ] Thanks . Sure . You surprised me , Martin . You came through . [ Groaning ] Oh , well , that kind of hurts . You know , the burns on my hands . Really ? Sorry . Brayden Croix . That was my name . Brayden . I enlisted in the Elite Services to pay for my postgraduate studies . I can 't - I mean , I can 't yet remember in what field . You will . Hmm . Mm . Are you angry ? You paid for a heroic act as if you were a criminal . Right now ... I 'm relieved ... and grateful . So am I , Yale . Or should I call you Brayden ? [ Laughs ] Uh , I 'm not yet ready to change things overnight . No . One day at a time . [ Morgan Narrating ] We are finding that it 's impossible to learn about this planet ... without also learning about ourselves . Yale and I had both tapped into the vast intelligence ... that we now know is humming beneath our feet . It 's an extraordinary new world , and survival is simply a question of whether we can reach deep enough ... to find the extraordinary in ourselves .

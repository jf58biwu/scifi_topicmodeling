 Milepost 1 34 . Two miles to go . I 'm all a-tingle . So , Mulder , this supposed clandestine source who 's contacted you . How do we know that he 's not just another crackpot ... whose encyclopedic knowledge of extraterrestrial life ... isn 't derived exclusively from reruns of Star Trek ? Because of where this particular crackpot works- - Groom Lake , Area 51 , - where the military has conducted- - - For the past 50 years ... classified experiments involving extraterrestrial technology . It 's all our questions , the proof that we 've suspected ... but never been able to hold in our hands . That- - That proof is here . It 's the dim hope of finding that proof that 's kept us in this car ... or one very much like it for more nights than I care to remember . Diving hundreds , if not thousands , of miles ... through neighborhoods and cities and towns ... where people are raising families and buying homes ... and playing with their kids and their dogs , and , in short , living their lives , while we , we- - we just keep driving . What is your point ? Don 't you ever just want to stop ? Get out of the damn car ? Settle down and live something approaching a normal life ? This is a normal life . Mulder ? [ Tires Screeching ] I don 't know if we 're going to meet that crackpot after all . - Out of the car ! - [ Rifles Cocking ] Out of the car , sir ! Ma 'am . May I see some identification , please ? [ Sighs ] F.B.I. - You 're gonna have to leave immediately . - Why ? It 's a public highway . It also borders a U.S. government testing ground . What 's your business here ? - What are you doing out here in the middle of the night ? - What are you doing out here ? [ Scully ] Hiding top - secret test flights ? Using technology from U.F.O.s ? Flying saucers . I got a top secret for you . There 's no such thing as flying saucers . - Come on , Mulder . Let- - - [ Low Rumble ] [ Whooshing , Crackling ] Come on , Mulder . Let 's go . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! - Sir , open fire ? - No ! No , let ' em go . Let ' em go . Sir ? Your orders , sir ? I want to get out of here . [ Man ] Morris . - [ Exhales ] - Morris ! What do you think you 're doing ? Why 'd you let them go ? They didn 't know anything . They were F.B.I. agents obviously here to meet someone , very possibly an informant . You just sent away our best hope of finding out who . We can 't just disappear a couple of F.B.I. agents , Howard . We 'll get their own people to deal with them . That 's what Morris was thinking . Right , Morry ? Let 's go . [ Helicopter Blades Whirring ] Sir ! Yeah ? Your identification , sir . You do have identification ? Yeah . [ Indistinct ] What 's Wegman doing here ? Kind of late for the old man to be clocking in . Something must be up . I 'm gonna check it out . Kiss-ass . [ Whispers ] Scully . [ Motor Turns Off ] - Are you all right , Mulder ? - What are you talking about ? Well , you haven 't said anything since we left those men on the highway . Is something wrong ? I 'm fine . Gas cap 's on your side . Okay . If you don 't want to talk about it . [ Cell Phone Rings ] - [ Ringing Continues ] - Mulder ? Mulder- [ Line Ringing ] - Come on , Scully . Pick up . - Bastard ! - Huh ? Hello ? Hello ? Oh , Dana ? You want to pick me up a pack of Morley 's , please ? - Since when do you smoke ? - Well- - You 're not gonna be a Nazi about it , are you ? I ran a reverse trace on the outgoing calls . We definitely got a leak . I ran a reverse trace on the outgoing calls . We definitely got a leak . He called the F.B.I. this morning ... from Wegman 's office . - Wegman ? - The leak . He used the guest phone in Wegman 's office . - He 's rubbing our noses in it . - Hmm . In what ? In the fact that he works in this building . That he has access to everything . All our work . [ Scoffs ] And we don 't know who he is . [ Phone Rings ] - Morris ? - Yeah ? - [ Ringing Continues ] - You gonna answer that ? - Hello ? - What are you doing there ? - Just trying to work that out . - It 's midnight . I 've been waiting up . I didn 't know . What do you mean you didn 't know ? You said you 'd call . Morris- - - I forgot . - You always forget . This time don 't forget the milk . [ Dial Tone ] The wife ? [ Mimics Whiplash ] Come on , man . Let 's go home . [ Door Opens ] - Tired , Morry ? - There it is , huh ? Home , sweet home . All right . Good night , Jeff . - [ Woman ] Base operator . - Oh , um- - I , uh- - Would you like an outside line , Mr. Fletcher ? No , thank you . Good night . Look , kids , it 's Larry , the creepy stage- - September , along the- - - [ Woman ] Want to play ? - [ Man ] I think we already are . [ Actors Breathing Heavily ] [ Woman Moaning , Gasping ] [ Fire Extinguishers Hissing ] It was a routine test flight , sir . Craft suddenly lost altitude ... at 23 : 1 7 hours over Highway 37 5 . - What happened ? - We haven 't yet determined that , sir . We have recovered the flight data recorder , as well as the two pilots . Alive ? We found the copilot over here . - [ Grunting ] - My God . - The other man 's alive , but- - - But what ? We 're not sure yet . What happened , Captain ? [ Native Language ] I 'm sure he 's on his way . [ Exhales Deeply ] Mulder ! Hey . Hey , Dana . How 's it going ? Mulder , where have you been ? Oh , sorry . I just got a little lost on my way in . - You got lost ? - I 'm just a little- - you know , a little lost in my head . - Yeah . - Yeah . One of those days . Yeah . Hi , there . How are you this morning ? - The assistant director 's waiting , sir . - Great . Let 's do it . My two frequent fliers . I 'm to understand you were in Nevada yesterday . And after , what 's it been , two , three conversations ... such as this on the matter . - Uh , sir- - - This morning I got a phone call from the Pentagon ... demanding that the two of you be reprimanded ... for trespassing on a top-secret military installation . What do you think you were doing there ? - We were following a lead , sir . - And that 's part of your current case load ? A legitimate investigation ? Agent Scully and I were contacted by a confidential source . - What source ? - Oh , if I had the name , I 'd give it to you . Some whistle-blower working inside the so-called Area 51 . Said he had some " big deal " information . I gotta tell you , the whole thing turned out to be ... just one gigantic mistake on our part . Agent Mulder , you were specifically ordered not to pursue ... any line of investigation pertaining to the X-Files . Sir , you 're absolutely right . And on behalf of Agent Scully and myself , I 'd like to apologize ... for our blatant disregard of your direct order . You have our word . We will never , ever do that again . Mulder . Mulder ! - What ? - What was that about ? - What was what about ? - " " I 'd give you his name if I had it . " Whatever happened to protecting out contacts , our work ? He asked . Hang on a second . [ Chuckling ] - Well . Okay , then . - [ Claps Hands ] - What ? - What is going on with you ? Will you please stop trying to pick a fight with me ? Mulder , you are acting bizarre . Jealous ? [ Voices Chattering On TV , Indistinct ] - Scully ? - I can 't believe you . I just can 't believe you . And who is Scully ? - Good morning . - You could at least do me the courtesy ... of coming to bed at night , pretend we have a happy marriage . What if Chris or Terry had come down here first ? Seen their father being a pervert ? Did that ever occur to you ? Hey , uh- - Um- - Honey ? I need- - Have you s- - Have you seen my car keys ? - I thought I might have left them- - - Morning , Dad . Morning ... Terry . Oh , my God ! [ Sobbing ] Morris ! What did you do to Chris ? [ Sputtering ] Where are my keys ? - Yo , Dad . - Howdy , Terry . I 'm not Terry . - Chris . - Terence . Terry 's for wusses . And Terence isn 't ? Hey , uh , Terence , how about helping ... your old dad find his car keys ? No milk . I 'm taking the minivan . - Don 't I have my own car ? - Chris , did you give your father back his keys ? Okay , well , uh , everybody have a , uh , a good day at your various , uh- - - All right . - Mom ! Morris ! What about Chris ? - Chris ? - You said you 'd give me an answer today . Her nose . You said you 'd give her an answer about her nose . Um- - I think she 's a little young for plastic surgery , don 't you think ? - [ Sobbing ] - Oh , for God 's sake , Morris . A nose ring ! She says she wants a nose ring ! I hate you ! I wish you were dead ! Well , my work here is done . Have a nice day . You want a divorce , don 't you ? Just say the words . " " Joanne , I want a divorce . " Joanne ? Joanne , no . I will not live this way , Morris . I will not let you walk in and out like a stranger . - Maybe it 's better if you just- - - I 'm sorry . I 'm- - I 'm just not myself lately . Morris . You are wearing your suit from yesterday . Ladies and gentlemen , Mr.Johnny Cash . Morris , what are you doing ? It 's for you . Thanks . [ Door Shuts ] M- - Morris . - Morry , it 's Jeff . Where the hell are you ? - I 'm running a little late . Get your ass down here tout de suite . We got something big going down . - Bigger than what ? - Big as in I can 't say anything more over the phone . - Just get down here . - [ Dial Tone ] [ Chanting In Native Dialect ] - [ Chanting Continues ] - Do we know what he 's saying ? It seems he 's praying , sir . We 've identified the language , a Native American dialect- - Hopi , to be exact . The pilot 's name is Captain Robert McDonough . Born in Missoula , Montana . No known foreign language skills . Only since the crash , he claims to be one Mrs. Lana Chee , a 75 - year - old Hopi Indian woman born and raised in the Mowape Reservation ... about 3 5 miles from here . - Is it some kind of shell shock ? - We don 't think so , sir . This is Mrs. Lana Chee . We picked her up on the reservation this morning . At ease . - What 's your name ? - Captain Robert McDonough , sir ! I apologize for my present condition and appearing out of uniform , sir ! Do you know what happened last night , Captain ? Sir , we launched from base at 2300 hours and headed south . At approximately 23 : 1 5 , we lost power in the right rear quadrant . Do you know what , uh- - Do you know what caused the power loss ? No warning lights came up on the panel . All systems checked out in preflight . She just wasn 't in the mood to fly , sir . [ Morris ] Come on , baby . Be the hole . - Ah ! - [ Whispers ] Mulder ! I got a birdie . [ Phone Ringing ] Scully . Oh , thank goodness . Scully , it 's me . - I 'm sorry . Who is this ? - It 's me , Mulder . - Mulder . - Shh . [ Mulder ] I 'm sorry I couldn 't call sooner . Something really weird happened last night when that U.F.O. passed over us . - U.F.O. ? - You don 't remember ? You don 't remember . The man that you 're with- - That 's not me . His name is Morris Fletcher . He 's an Area 51 employee . Morris Fletcher . That 's right . Everybody here seems to think that I 'm him , but I 'm not . I 'm me , Mulder . Psst ! As long as they think I 'm him , I have access , but I 'm gonna need your help . - What was that ? - Uh , what was what ? This may not be a secure line . Mulder , uh , where are you ? I 'd better not say . Look , just get out here as soon as you can . How can I get in touch with you ? You won 't . I 'll get in touch with you . [ Dial Tone ] - Who do you suppose that was ? - That wasn 't your source ? - I 'll run a trace . - Uh- - No , no . I think we should notify el jefe A.S.A.P. We don 't want our collective asses chewed out all over again . Mulder ? Are you sure that 's the best thing to do ? Look , little lady , I think it 's time you got your panties on straight . We 're federal officers . We go by the book . That 'll be $ 1 .89 . You got 1 1 cents ' change . - Keep it . - Wow . Maybe I 'll just close early . [ Engine Starts ] [ Low Rumbling ] Turn around , big guy . We got trouble . Keep back ! We got a spill ! Sir ! Hey , Fletcher ! What the hell 's he doing ? Fletcher , what are you doing ? - There was a man in here , the attendant . - [ Man Groaning ] [ Groaning Continues ] Holy mother of- - It 's happened again . - What 's happened again ? - Let 's get out of here . - We got to help this man . - We got to help ourselves . Whatever caused this could come back . - We can 't just leave him here . - Morris- - - What the hell 's the matter with you ? - Morris - - - I 'm not asking you , I 'm telling you . Let 's go . - This man needs a doctor . [ Gunshot ] Not anymore . Burn it . Clear perimeter 200 feet ! Everybody , pull back ! Come on , Morry . That guy was dead long before we found him . [ Woman Giggling ] [ Kissing Noises ] Agent Scully . - [ Morris ] Can 't get enough , huh ? - It 's me . - Oh , hey , Dana . - What do you think you 're doing ? Oh , you know , just a little lunch break . What 's up ? We got the trace back on the call we received this morning . It came from a gas station pay phone off of Highway 37 5 , three miles east of Groom Lake . And ? And I 'm thinking it was your source . Although I don 't know why he 'd try and impersonate you . - Maybe so . - You don 't think that we should follow up on this ? - Maybe so . - You don 't think that we should follow up on this ? Are you out of your pretty little mind ? Am I out of my mind ? Mulder , you are out of your mind . What is up with you ? I 'm thinking about having you examined for mental illness ... or-or drug use or- - or maybe a massive head injury . This is an X-File . Your life 's work . Your crusade . As I understand it , we 're off the X-Files . [ Door Slams ] Bitch . [ Howard ] This was brought to a local vet . Some kid found this in the desert ten miles east of the gas station . Show me on the map . Right here . This is where you found the gas station attendant ? Yes , sir . We located the pilot of the crash site here ... and the Indian woman right there . - What 's this ? - That , we believe , is ground zero . Once we analyze the flight data recorder , we hope to confirm it 's where the warp began . - Warp ? - Beam me up , Scotty . It 's a tear in the space-time continuum . An anomaly created by the malfunction of the aircraft ... which was operating in gravity pulse mode before it went down . We 've been flying these things since ' 53 . I never heard of anything like this . According to quantum physics , it 's possible . Antigravity systems utilize bends in space and time for propulsion . A sudden shift in a craft 's trajectory ... could create the kind of distortion we 're witnessing right here- - a lizard and a rock existing in the same time and space . If this is where your so-called warp began , we would have all seen it . The three of us were out on Highway 37 5 at the time , sir , intercepting two F.B.I. agents . The fact that none of us remembers seeing it is evidence that my theory is correct . - And how 's that ? - Lost time . Lost time is a common symptom of close proximity to antigravity propulsion . Then how come my head isn 't in a rock , or Morris 's ? That 's one question I haven 't been able to answer . It is possible we suffered consequences from our exposure that we 're not fully aware of . What do we do about it ? That 's your department- - keep it out of the paper , make sure witnesses disappear . Yeah , but how do we reverse it ? How do we get the lizard out of the rock ? Who says we can ? This is not a marriage . It 's a farce ! - What ? - You 're not attracted to me anymore . - I disgust you , don 't I ? - No . No , it 's-it 's not that you 're disgusting . [ Stammering ] It 's just that- - It 's just that you don 't want to make love to me ever again , that 's all . That , and you mumbled something about Scully in your sleep . Who is Scully , Morris ? Is it another woman ? Does Scully sound like a woman 's name to you ? Who is Scully ? Tell me . Look , Joanne , I 'm sure I 've told you many times in the past ... that there are things about my work that unfortunately I have to keep a secret . Oh , no , Buster . That 's not gonna fly this time . My point is that there are a lot of things you don 't know about me . And ... I 've just been- - I 've been under a lot of pressure lately . Up is down . Black is white . I don 't know where I stand anymore . I don 't even know who I am , really , anymore . I just- - I know for sure ... that I am not the man you married . I 'm just not , and I 'm sorry . I 'm truly sorry . Oh , God , Morris . I didn 't know . They have that pill now . We can work this out . There 's other ways to be intimate . - [ Doorbell Rings ] - I think that was the doorbell . We can make this work . - Yes ? - Hi . My name is Dana Scully . I 'm looking for Morris Fletcher . Morris ! You son of a bitch ! I 'm sorry . Uh , Morris Fletcher ? Scully , it 's me . It 's Mulder . You 're , uh- - You 're the man from the other night from Area 51 ? [ Joanne ] Liar ! You phoned me . Mind telling me what this is about ? No , I 'm Mulder . I 'm really Mulder . I switched bodies , places , identities with this man , Morris Fletcher- - the man that you think is Mulder , but he 's not . Of course you don 't believe me . Why was I expecting anything different ? Your full name is Dana Katherine Scully . Your badge number is- - Hell , I don 't know your badge number . Your mother is Margaret . Your brother is Bill , Jr . He 's in the navy and hates me . Lately for lunch , you 've been having this little six-ounce cup of plain yogurt , into which you stir bee pollen because you 're on a bee pollen kick ... even though I tell you you 're a scientist and should know better . Cheater ! - Look , - [ Door Slams ] any of that information could 've been gathered by anyone . Even that yogurt thing ? That is so you . That is so Scully . It 's good to know you haven 't changed . That 's somewhat comforting . - Look , I don 't know what the point of all this is . - I 'll prove it to you . No , you won 't . But I wouldn 't mind if you came clean with me . Scientific proof about what happened to us on that road two nights ago . - Fair enough ? - [ Door Opens ] I am calling the police . - [ Door Slams ] - Good-bye , Mr. Fletcher . I will prove it to you , Scully . Tonight . I 'll prove everything . Okay ? [ Car Engine Starts ] [ Ringing ] - Howard Grodin . - [ Morris ] Mr. Grodin ? This is Special Agent Mulder of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . - How are you this morning ? - How did you get this number ? Frankly , that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . Sir , I am obligated to tell you that you have a security leak in your facility . A man with whom you have worked very closely has contacted this office on several occasions ... and offered me access to highly classified information . - Would you happen to have a name for this man ? - Why , yes . Yes , I would . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Scully . - You 're in Nevada again . Uh , sir , I- - [ Kersh ] Do not speak , Agent . Listen . Your partner already apprised me of his conversation with the air force ... and his fervent desire to save you from making a fatal career mistake . Therefore , you will follow my instructions to the letter . Sir , I don 't know what Mulder told you- - You will follow my instructions to the letter . Otherwise don 't bother coming back from Nevada . Can I help you ? Scully , I got it . I got the proof . [ V ehicles Approaching ] [ Rifles Cocking ] - I 'm sorry . - Scully , you ? - Damn it , Morris . - You ! You son of a bitch ! You orchestrated this whole thing ! He 's not me , Scully ! Would I do this ? Would I do this ? Scully ! No , you bastard ! Tell her the truth ! Scully , he 's not me ! He 's not me ! Scully , he 's not me ! [ Child ] I made this ! [ Child ] I made this !

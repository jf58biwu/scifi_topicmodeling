Did you get some on you , Dave ? Didn 't want you to get fined . Just trying to be neighborly . Gotta be up to code . [ Kline ] Shroeder 's out there painting our mailbox . ! You know what I 'm gonna do ? I 'm gonna paint the whole damn house pink . Forget about the mailbox , huh ? I 'm gonna make this whole damn place look like you won it selling cosmetics . How ' bout that ? That 'll show these Nazis . Honey , would you just calm down ? Rules are rules . They 're repainting our mailbox because it 's desert sienna instead of desert sage . - This guy is a freakin ' weirdo . - Hon , what 's that package ? I don 't know . It doesn 't say who sent it . - Whoa . - Tasteful . Boy , the neighbors would really hate that . [ Tapping ] [ Tapping Stops ] Honey , what is it ? [ Floorboards Creaking ] Stay here . [ Screaming ] Dave ? Honey ? [ Loud Banging ] - [ Woman Screaming ] - [ Banging ] Wow . Take a look at this . Honey , what do you think ? Is this place us or what ? You must be the Petries . Hi . Welcome . Welcome to the Falls . [ Giggling ] I 'm Rob , and this is my lovely wife Laura . - Rob and Laura Petrie . - We pronounce it " " Pee-trie , " actually . - Oh . - Like the dish . Well , it 's so nice to meet you . I 'm Pat V erlander . I live six doors down . I 'm the neighborhood welcome wagon . - We 're pleased to make your acquaintance , Pat . - I really must say . - It 's ten after 5 : 00 . I don 't think you 're gonna make it . - I 'm sorry ? The 6 : 00 cutoff ? All move-ins are required to be completed by 6 : 00 p.m. It 's in the C.C. R.s. It 's one of our rules . Wow . The photos did not do it justice . Guys , fast , fast . Come on . Quick . The previous owners left it so clean . What do you do for a living , Mr. Petrie ? That 's right , isn 't it ? Yeah . I , uh- - I work mostly at home , which is great for Laura because she gets me all to herself . Oh . [ Chuckles ] This place really is immaculate , Pat . I wouldn 't mind sending a thank-you note to the previous owners . That 's sweet . Um- - Good . [ Chuckles ] Okay , move it , people . Come on . - Rob and Laura Petrie . - Yes . - " " Pee-trie . " - Win Shroeder , next-door neighbor . Welcome . Hi , Win . Nice to meet you . Don 't you folks worry . We 'll have you moved in before 6 : 00 . Time ? - 5 : 1 9 - Pardon me , neighbor . - Excuse us . - Thanks . Oh , thank you . Thanks . Thank you . Excuse me ! - I 'll get that . - No , don 't be silly . It 's heavy . I got it . Oh , no . I 'm- - I 'm so sorry . - I 'm really sorry . - Mike . Mike , Mike , Mike , it 's okay . - It 's okay , Mike . Go help Gordy . - Send me any bills . I 'm- - I 'm sorry . I 'm Cami Shroeder , by the way . Win 's wife . Nice to meet you . I 'm Laura . - Where does this go ? - You can just put that right here in the driveway . Whoa . Hold on . Hold on . Let 's talk . A B-ball fan ? Shooting hoops- - That 's- - That 's not good . That 's definitely gonna stand out in your front yard over there . - Stand out , Win ? - Well , as in , uh , not be aesthetically pleasing ... to the eye . But , hey , maybe you can get special dispensation from Mr. Gogolak , president of our home owner 's association . I 'd take it up with him . But in the meantime , let 's keep that in the garage . [ Chuckles ] Put it in the garage . Okay . Let 's finish getting you folks moved in . Let 's go , people ! Let 's move , move . ! [ Engine Starting ] [ Man ] Bye . Oh , yeah . Nothing weird going on around here . Hey . Wait a minute . You didn 't let me carry you over the threshold . - You ready ? - Let 's get it on , honey . All right , then . - [ Sighs ] - [ Object Rattling ] Thanks to our friendly neighbors , there will be no flourescein bloodstain enhancement . Not that it makes much difference . This place is so clean you can build computer chips . Okay . 6 : 01 p.m. , February 2 4 . Agents Scully and Mulder ... in the former home of David and Nancy Kline ... who disappeared without a trace lastJuly . The Klines were the third such couple to disappear ... since this neighborhood was built in 1 991 . All were apparently stable professional people ... with no history of violence , domestic discord or mental illness . And it took a family member or employee ... to realize that they were gone ... including their cars and a few personal items . What local police found in each case was nothing - - just impeccably-manicured homes ... and a community of neighbors who professed total ignorance that anyone had disappeared . That 's pretty surprising considering how nutty this bunch is about being neighborly . The local police department were at a dead end , so they turned to the F.B.I. A.D. Skinner in assigning us this case ... thought a fruitful approach to the investigation would be ... if we went undercover posing as prospective home buyers ... as this planned community would seem to hide ... a dark , possibly murderous conspiracy of silence . You want to make that honeymoon video now ? - Rob and Laura Petrie ? - " " Pee-trie . " Mulder , if we ever go undercover again , I get to choose the names , okay ? - Fine . - This tells me that you 're not taking this seriously . I 'm taking it seriously . I just don 't understand why we 're on it . It 's our first catch back on the X-Files . This isn 't an X-File . Sure it is . It 's unexplained . What do you want , aliens ? - Tractor beams ? - Wow . Admit it . You just want to play " " house . " [ Doorbell Chimes ] Woman , get back in here and make me a sandwich ! [ Removes Gloves ] Did I not make myself clear ? [ Doorbell Chimes ] Hi . Well , - you didn 't need to do that . - Oh , please . I have more dishes than I need . I just usually use one and then ... wash it . Uh- - - I 'm , uh , Mike Raskub , by the way . - Hi . - Big Mike , for obvious reasons . I live the next street over . - Oh . That 's a caduceus . - Are you a doctor , Mike ? - No . A vet . V eterinarian . If you folks are thinking about getting a dog , or any pet , I 'd be happy to check it out for you , no charge . Just , uh , you 're not allowed to have over 1 6 pounds of pet . That 's one of the C.C. R.s. Mighty nice of you , Mike . Gosh . With all this hospitality , I can 't believe the Klines ever left . That , uh - - That was their name , wasn 't it ? The , uh , Klines ? I have to go . Mulder . The name is Rob . What you got there ? Looks like whoever cleaned this place maybe missed a spot . That look like blood to you ? That look like blood to you ? Mm-hmm . How 'd it get way up there ? [ Pat ] I , uh , didn 't really learn much about them . He just said he works at home , which tells me she 's got money . Seemed nice . Cute couple . [ Mike ] Mmm , very cute . - Uh , they 're a nice couple . - What do you think , Gene ? - Ladies , my compliments to the chef . - Cami ? Sissy ? These Petries , are they gonna play ball ? " " Pee-tries . " Uh , so far , so good . I 'm keeping my eye on ' em . Um , Mr. Gogolak . Don 't you think that , uh , maybe this time it would be better ... if we told them ? Mike , you and I have been through this before . We don 't know yet if we can trust them . It 's just that ... there are so many- - so many rules . I think that maybe they would be able to keep up with them better ... if they knew what happened if they don 't . It 's the neighborly thing to do . I really think we should do this . Son , Godspeed . Thank you . Um , can I , uh , use your- - Second door to the left . There 's Glade under the sink . Gordy , how about you go make sure he finds it . - Gene , I can talk him out of this . - Win . The boy 's a weak link , and a strong chain can 't survive with a weak link . [ Man On T V ] ... is instinctive and necessary for survival . Failure to conform within the tribal structure can often prove lethal . When group elders suspect such an outcast within their midst , tribal members gather in a circle ... - to perform a ritual chant in the belief ... - [ Glass Breaks ] that this will expose the unwitting conduit of evil . - The chanters eventually settle on the so - called misfit - - - Oh , no . [ Groans , Panting ] [ Grunts ] Come on . Yes . [ Groans ] - [ Footsteps Pounding ] - No . No , I fixed it ! I fixed it ! [ Screaming ] Morning . Oh ! Oh , Rob , Laura . I 'm so sorry . So , good morning . So , how was your first night ? Peaceful ? It was wonderful . We just spooned up and fell asleep like little baby cats . - Isn 't that right , honey bunch ? - That 's right , poopy head . Win , are we in the right place ? I thought this was Big Mike 's house . Yeah , yeah . I 'm just , uh- - I 'm just helping out . Mike had to leave town on business . What kind of business ? I thought he was a veterinarian . V eterinarian business , I guess . I just know he 's gone weeks at a time . - I 'll just leave this here then . - Let me take those . Just ... tidier-looking than leaving them on the front porch . It 'd be more aesthetically pleasing , huh ? Exactly . Say , would you two like to join ... Cami and me for dinner this evening , about 6 : 00 ? - We eat early . - That sounds great . Thanks . Great . Oh , Win , you mentioned , uh , that I could talk to someone about putting up my basketball hoop ? Who was that again ? Mr. Gogolak , was it ? All right , then , let 's see . Basketball hoop and backboard . Portable . Nope , I 'm sorry . It 's not allowed . - You 're kidding ? - I 'm afraid not . Rules are rules . It may not sound like anything - - a simple basketball hoop - - but from there it 's just a few short steps to spinning daisy reflectors ... and a bass boat in the driveway . In other words , anarchy . It may sound tough , but ours is a system that works . That 's why the Falls is ... one of the top-ranked planned communities in all of California . Most of our homeowners have been here since day one . I love the decor here , Mr. Gogolak . Is it , um , Occidental ? Well , it 's , uh , Nepalese and Tibetan mostly . - I go there twice a year on business . - Oh . I run Pier 9 Imports . I can get you a great deal on rattan furniture if you 're interested . Indoor only . Outdoor use is prohibited by our C.C. R.s. Uh-uh , Scruffy . Go on , now . Sweetheart , did you use the dolphin-safe tuna this time ? - Dolphin-safe all the way , honey . - We always use dolphin-safe . You 've got to love those dolphins , although they 're pretty tasty too . [ Laughs ] So , where 'd you two meet ? - Actually , it was at a U.F.O. conference . - [ Win ] Flying saucers ? Interesting . Wouldn 't have thought you folks would have been into that . Well , it 's not me so much as Laura . She 's quite the new-ager . I mean , she 's into those magnetic bracelets and crystals and mood rings , what have you . I mean , God bless her . She 's a sucker for all that stuff . - Well , I wouldn 't have guessed that , would you ? - Mm-mm . - No kidding . - Yeah . You know , Win , when you , uh- - when you told me this morning ... that Big Mike was out of town on business , I don 't think that 's true . You don 't ? No , ' cause we called his office . Didn 't we , honey ? - We did . - Yeah . [ Clears Throat ] We 're thinking about getting a dog , so we wanted to ask him his advice ... and see if his office had a forwarding number and they said- - - That he wasn 't there . They didn 't know where he was . - Yeah . Do you know where he is , Win ? [ Chuckles ] I really couldn 't tell you . It 's gotta be something really freaky-deaky . I mean , for him to lie about it like that ? Maybe he 's got some wild secret life going on . [ Laughing ] But every community has its dark underbelly , don 't you think ? We don 't have any underbelly . As far as I 'm concerned , this community is the American Dream . [ Cami ] Um - - I 'm sorry . I , um , realized that it 's past time that I walk Scruffy . - Would you like some company ? - Yeah . So , is this the American Dream ? This place ? Oh . Uh- - Nice neighborhood , you know . Just a lot of people who want the best for their families . So it 's just not your dream . You know , Cami , I 've noticed ... that you 've walked us past Mike 's house ... twice . Are you worried about him ? - No . I don 't really know what you mean . - [ Barking ] Scruffy ! Scruffy , come here ! Scruffy , no ! Scruffy ! Scruffy , come out here ! Scruffy . Scruffy , come out of there . [ Barking Continues ] - Let me take a look . - Do you see him ? Uh-uh . [ Yelping ] Scruffy , it 's okay . It 's okay . I got you . I got you . - What 's he got there ? - Deep breath . That 's a close one , huh ? Yeah ? - That 's a good boy . - Let me wipe that off . That 's a good boy . Okay , let 's get you home . Come on . - All right , Lieutenant . - Caduceus . Thank you . Local P.D. came up blank on ... Mike Raskub . No activity on his credit cards . No sighting ofhis '97 Mercury Villager . There 's no sign of him in his house . I didn 't see him in the storm drain either . - I take it he 's dead , Scully . - Laura . Think it 's Win Shroeder ? Maybe Win cleaning up . - Cleaning up for who ? - I don 't know . Mulder , speaking of cleaning up , whoever taught you how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste ? What do we know about this stuff ? I 'm driving down to San Diego tomorrow to have it analyzed . - All right . - Third warning . Toilet seat . - Why kill Big Mike ? - [ Gasps ] What 's missing here is intent . What would be the motive ? Compulsive neatness , or a lack thereof . Have you noticed how everybody around here ... is obsessed with the neighborhood rules and C.C. R.s. ? - You know , you fit in really well here . - And you don 't . Anyway , tomorrow I got a surefire way of testing out my theory . Come on , Laura . You know . We 're married now . Scully , Mulder . Good night . The thrill is gone . Bring it on . [ Toilet Flushes ] [ Basketball Bouncing ] - Stay here . - Stop him , Win . - Stay here ! - Stop him ! Hey , Win , wanna play " " horse " ? - What the hell are you doing ? - What am I doing ? - What are you doing ? - Damn it ! Get off of it ! Help me get this inside . - What 's gonna happen if we don 't ? - Fine . - That 's the way you want it ? - It 's just a basketball hoop , Win . I don 't understand why you 're getting all bent out of shape . - You were warned . - [ Chuckles ] Warned about what ? [ Cami Screaming ] No . ! No . ! No . ! No . ! - Stop ! - [ Crying ] Cami , you all right ? [ Floorboards Creaking ] - Mulder ? - [ Banging ] Mulder , is that you ? [ Banging ] [ Gasps ] - Whoa ! - Sorry , Mulder . - Somebody was in the house . - Tidying up . Whoever it was , they put away my basketball hoop . Somebody 's looking out after us , Scully , which may not be a bad thing . - What do you mean ? - I got a look at that thing that 's been scaring everybody . I take it back . This is an X-File . How 's Cami ? What did we do wrong , Gene ? Was our welcome mat not to your liking ? Did I coil my garden hose clockwise instead of counterclockwise ? Hold the phone now . Are you saying that I had something to do with this ? Who else ? The exact same thing- - the thing you had me do to Mike . - Who else would do that ? - Son , you 'll wanna take a deep breath ... and rethink that theory . It 's your next-door neighbor , Win . He 's a rabble-rouser . He 's trouble with a capital " " T. " And you and I both know it only takes one rotten apple ... to spoil the whole bunch . Here we go . Yeah . I 'm guessing there 's one of these in every yard . I think this is how this thing travels- - where it lives . In the ground ? This huge creature you think you saw ? [ Sighs ] Look , Mulder , huge creatures aside , do you care to hear what I think ? Always . [ Scully ] These are the lab results from the San Diego P.D. First of all , the stuff that we found on the fan blade- - dried blood and scalp hairs ? It 's neither . The blood is predominantly ketchup and brake fluid ... - [ Scoffs ] - and the hairs are bristles from a scrub brush . And the same goes for the sample we found on the dog 's muzzle . It 's coffee grounds , eggshells and motor oil ... with about 50 other constituents with a little mercurochrome for color . In other words , Mulder , it 's garbage , which makes perfect sense ... because this entire neighborhood has been built upon an old landfill . - A landfill ? - Mm-hmm . We found this stuff everywhere because it is everywhere . It 's just beneath the topsoil . And that protrusion in the front yard may occur from the venting of methane gas . But , Mulder , I don 't see how any of this has to do ... with the disappearances that we 're investigating . - It does . Somehow , it 's one and the same . The Klines ? - Yeah ? - What if they 're still here ? - You mean buried in the yard ? Well , once we start a forensic excavation , our cover 's blown . [ Engine Rumbling ] [ Gasps ] What in God 's name are you doing ? - God- - - Putting in a pool . In the front yard ? What , are you insane ? Have you even looked at the C.C. R.s ? - You can 't just put in a swimming pool ! - It 's not a swimming pool . It 's a reflecting pool . I checked the rules . There 's no rule against putting in a reflecting pool . It 's very tranquil . You 'd like it . Let him dig his own grave . Hey . Mulder . [ Groans ] The Klines aren 't down there . I think it 's time you called it a night . Tasteful , isn 't it ? - Gogolak . Hey , can you get an excavation team out here ? - Yeah . - We need to dig deeper . - Where are you going ? To price some rattan furniture . [ Sighs ] [ Line Ringing ] Yes , this is Special Agent Dana Scully . I need a full forensic team to 450 Autumn Terrace . No , not tomorrow . Tonight . [ Banging ] I 'm sorry . Can I call you back ? Jesus . [ Footsteps Banging ] Oh , God . - [ Muffled Scream ] - It 's come for you , Laura . You can 't make a noise . - [ Gasps ] - Shh . Shh . Mike . What happened to you ? - You have to get out of here . - Why ? - [ Footsteps Banging ] - What are you talking about ? Who 's downstairs ? - Shh . Shh . Shh . - Mike . - Who did this to you ? - The ubermenscher . It 's our fault . The original homeowners . We asked for it and now we can 't stop it . Stop what , Mike ? I tried to give it Shroeder . You know , tit for tat . Just like Shroeder did for me . Mike , listen . Settle down . Okay ? Just give me my gun . I 'm a federal agent . The ubermenscher wants you , Laura . Your husband- - he 's broken way too many rules . I 've been hiding in the sewer . I tried to warn him . [ Banging On Door ] Mike , just give me the gun . [ Gunshots ] [ Mike Screams ] No . ! - F.B.I. ? What did I do ? - Let 's start with the Klines . You 're responsible for them being in little pieces in my front yard . - You gave them that lawn ornament- - guy with the axe ? - Whirligig . Yeah , whirligig . It 's tacky enough to break your rules and C.C. R.s. Tacky enough to mark the Klines for death . And won 't that sound good in a court of law ? When the judge asks you who killed the Klines , what exactly are you gonna tell him ? A tulpa . It 's a Tibetan thought-form . It 's a living creature willed into existence by someone who possesses that ability- - an ability I think you picked up on your whirligig - buying excursions to the Far East . Why 'd you do it ? I mean , is it so damn important ... for everybody to have the same color mailbox ? It 's important that people fit in . But you didn 't know exactly what you were getting into , did you ? I mean , you can summon its existence , but- - You can give it life , but you can 't control it . The best you can hope for is to stay out of its way . Son , my lawyers are gonna make you sound so stupid ... that not only will I never see the inside of a jail cell , but you 'll be signing all your paychecks straight to me . [ Win ] Gene ? Win . You 've got two F.B.I. agents living next door to you . Cheer up . It 's not for long . Scully ? Scully ? - Scully ? - [ Banging ] - [ Scully ] Mulder ? - Scully ? - Mulder ? - Scully , hang on . Come here . Help me with this . - Win , come here . - [ Footsteps ] Win . ! Win , wait a minute . No . No . He deserves what he gets . Mulder , it was here . [ Screaming ] Mulder . [ Screaming Continues ] [ Scully 's Voice ] Several residents of the Falls ... have now come forward to blame the deaths in the neighborhood ... on home owner association president Gene Gogolak . These same residents deny Agent Mulder 's allegations ... that they were in some sense all responsible for the demise of Gogolak himself , claiming ignorance as to what actually killed him . It would seem the code of silence that hid the sins of this community ... has not only survived , but in its creator , claimed a final victim . Meanwhile , the Falls at Arcadia has been named ... one of the top planned communities in California for the sixth year running . [ Child ] I made this . ! [ Child ] I made this . !

 Nice place ? I 've seen better . Everybody downstairs ! Good afternoon . Afternoon , sir . Where do you want this thing ? Just through there , thank you . Come on , you guys . I 've got a surprise for you ! Want me to place him right over here , sir ? Yup , just over there . H-here 's a place . Here . Yeah , okay . Move it over here . There ya go . Nice and easy . That 's right . Easy . Lift it up . Sweetie , come away from it , please . W-what is it , daddy ? Wait , wait , wait . Wow . Wow . My . Thank you , sir . Enjoy your ndr . Northam robotics household model ndr-114 , serial number 583625 . - Hello . - Hello . Are you one 's family ? Well , um , I guess so . It 's scary . It 's not scary . It 's stupid . - I doubt that . - Jenny Harrison 's family 's got one , so does Kate McAllister- - they 're all the same . What is it ? It 's an android . What 's an " Andrew " ? Will that be one 's name ? Well , why not ? It sounds good . - Hello , Andrew . - Hello , sir . Would you care to hear the three laws of robotics ? - It 's said to be a most entertaining presentation . - Okay . Sure . - Will you step back , sir , to maximize presentation ? - Right . * * A robot may not injure a human being , or , through inaction , cause a human being to come to harm . Second law : A robot must obey all human orders , except where those orders come in conflict with the first law . A robot must protect itself , so long as doing so does not conflict with the first two laws . * * Andrew , don 't ever do that again . Of course not , sir . It is a one-time only . There is another option that one is obligated to point out , sir : You may have one with or without personality . Would you care to see a demo of the personality chip ? No , no , thank you . We 'll stick with what we 've got . A wise choice , sir , if one may say so . Well , you 'll be staying down here . Got everything you need ? - One only requires access to a power outlet . - Good . Right . Well , um , good night , Andrew . It certainly is , sir . No . No , Andrew , the correct response to " good night " is " good night . " - Good night . - Yes . You just said " yes . " Yes ? But the correct response to " good night " is " good night . " - Good night , Andrew . - Good night , sir . - Good night , Andrew . - Good night , sir . - You only need to say it once . - Or one would be saying it forever , sir , in an infinite verbal loop . Exactly . Thank you , sir . Good . Night . Sorry , sir . Honey , I don 't want it ... Following me around the house all day . Can 't-can 't you turn it off or something , please ? Just give him a job . It 'll be okay . - Well- - seat belts ! - Seat belts ! Good morning , Mr. Martin . Today 's temperature will be in the high 70s . Bye , mom ! Have a good day , sweethearts . Have a good day , sweethearts . - Andrew , this is very good . - Thank you , sir . Don 't you think ? I think it sucks . " Sucks " ? How ? Chickens do not have lips . She 's being rude . You mind your manners , young lady , please . - We 're fine , Andrew . - Indeed you are , sir . The kitchen . It 's fine too , sir . No . Go to the kitchen now . Hello . Come on . Maybe it 's a big bluff . Just a pretty face . Check . Andrew , could you come up ? Should I- - No . It 'll be fine . Yes , miss ? Andrew , would you please open the window ? One is glad to be of service . A lovely breeze . Now jump . No , out the window . Did you hear something ? Was that an earthquake ? Sorry for the inconvenience . May one re-re-re-enter ... Er-er ? What happened , Andrew ? For the sake of family harmony , One is programmed not to tell . Andrew ? Andrew ! Yeah ? Amanda , grace , downstairs right away . Come in , Andrew . Thank you , si-i-i-r . Andrew 's not a person , he 's a form of property . One is not a per-r-r-r-r-r-r - son . But property is also important . So from now on , as a matter of principle , in this family Andrew will be treated as if he were a person . Which means there will be no more attempts to break him . Break him ? Your sister tried to kill Andrew . You too ? Shh . Sorry . Come on . Everyone up to bed . - Will you be all right , Andrew ? - One is capable of self-mai-ai-aintenance , sir . Good . - Good night , Andrew . - Good night , Andrew . Guh , guh , guh- - G-good night . Good night , Andrew . Good ... night . Miss , one has been given specific orders for your safety , and that is an unsafe area . Now , come down . Okay . Thank you . " Well , I think it 's gonna be sunny tonight . " " Me too . " " So do I. " He 's my favorite . Pretty . Would you like to hold him ? That was my favorite . They don 't even make him anymore . - Can it be repaired , little miss ? - No , it can 't ! - You 're screwed . - I hate you ! Get away from me . Can we fix him ? No . Look at him- - he 's in a million pieces ! I 'm sorry . There 's nothing you can do . Put the rest of them away . Wow . Andrew ! Yes , little miss ? This is the best present I ever got . One is glad to be of service . Would you please come with me ? Does this involve a window ? No . You can sit here . His name is woofy , and from now on ... He 's yours . Woofy . Because sometimes he barks , once he gets to know you . Thank you very much . You 're welcome . I have to go to sleep now , Andrew . - Yes . - Yeah . Can you , kinda- - Of course . - Good night , sweetheart . - Good night , Andrew . Little miss ? Sure . Thanks . Miss ? - After you . - Well , thank you . You 're welcome . Andrew , did you really make this ? Yes , sir . A robot cannot tell a lie , Andrew . That is not entirely correct , sir . One cou lie , if one were ordered to lie , or if it were necessary to tell some untruth in order to keep a human being from harm , or if one 's own safety were in jeopardy- - sir ? Andrew . One did indeed carve that for little miss . And the design- - you 're responsible for that ? Yes , sir . - What did you copy it from ? - Copy it , ma 'am ? Well , I mean , you didn 't just get it out of thin air . You got it out of some book , right , or used the computer to plot it out ? One did nothing more than study the raw material for a time ... Until one came to understand how best to carve it into a shape ... That would appeal to little miss 's love of tiny mammals . * * * * * * * * * * Yes , yes . Please come in . I am so glad you called . Mansky , Dennis mansky . Richard mark . And an ndr-114 . Now , I got your message , but what exactly is it doing ? Well , what interests me is he shows a number of characteristics- - Like creativity , curiosity , friendship- - That , frankly , have taken us by surprise . Andrew- - Yes , Dennis ? Social as well . Now I 'd like to show you something if I may . Now , Andrew carved these . These are original works of art , and last night Andrew said , " I enjoy making them . " " Enjoy . " Yes . Should one not use that word ? No , no . It 's fine , Andrew . See what I mean ? It 's unusual , surely , to hear a robot talk about enjoying something . What I want to know is , do many of your other robots have- - have feelings like this ? Must be ... Something in the pathways . So , then , will you be wanting a refund or a replacement ? No , neither . I just wanted to get your reaction to Andrew . I wanted to know what you think . He 's unique , wouldn 't you say ? It is an anomaly . No refund , no replacement- - How much do you want ? - I don 't think I understand . - Well , clearly you realize if word of this gets out , we 'll have to recall our entire line . We 're in people 's homes , sir , with their children . If it is doing what you say , it can also run amok . One is not qualified to run " mucks . " All right , sir . If I let you have Andrew , you 'll what- - you 'll disassemble him , will you ? Carefully , yes . We would need to trace the actual course of Andrew 's neural pathways , replace the positronic brain , then put it- - Him- - back together and return him to you , good as new . Now , these neural pathways are presumably fragile . Isn 't it possible , in the course of these procedures , that something might go wrong ? We would make every conceivable effort . And , in the unlikely event that something did go wrong , you 'd , of course , replace Andrew . Of course . Even though he 's unique and irreplaceable . He- - his- - You s- - Well , it 's a natural error- - It has human form , therefore you read mechanical failure as eccentricity ... And anthropomorphize it . It is a household appliance , and yet you act like it is a man . We 're leaving . Come on , Andrew . Please , I beg you to reconsider , Mr. Martin . Let us examine Andrew , talk to your wife . Name your price ! Now , listen to me . There is no price for individuality . He is , for better or for worse , my robot , and you will never lay your hands on him- - do you understand ? All in good time . You see , sooner or later you 'll have to bring it in for repairs . Andrew , I 've made a decision . Yes , sir ? You will cut back on your workload . You can no longer ... Devote yourself entirely to children and housework . But one likes the children , sir , specifically the smaller one , little miss . That is a contradiction , Andrew , and that is exactly the sort of thing you need to learn about . Thank you for choosing northam robotics . So we need a new regimen . Regimen , sir ? First of all , you 'll spend part of each day making something . So as not to offend humans , we 'd better find something that 's not overly artistic . Could you make other things ? I could teach you my line of work- - You know , timepieces and clocks and so on . One could not tell you , sir . One has never attempted such things . Well , you will now . Also , you 'll spend part of each evening in instruction with me . And what is the purpose of this instruction ? To teach you , Andrew- - To teach you all the things that haven 't been programmed into you . Andrew , you 're unique . Unique ? Thank you for choosing northam robotics . And I feel a responsibility to help you ... Become whatever you 're able to be . And what is one able to be ? Well , I don 't know . See , people grow through time . But then , of course , for you , time is a completely different proposition . For you , time is endless . Endless ? Is this a good piece ? Very . What about this one ? Excellent . * it was a lucky April shower * * it was the most convenient door * * I found a million-dollar baby * * in a five and ten cent store * * * * And , nine months later , a baby is born . And those , Andrew , are the so-called facts of life . People actually do this , sir ? Well , yes . And married people- - One supposes they see it as some kind of requirement or obligation . Well , it- - It 's not exactly an obligation , Andrew . That 's a relief . And it is the natural and preferable way to conceive children . Sir , of all these millions of sperm , only one makes it ? - That 's true . - What happens to the others ? Well , they die . They die ? One feels badly for them . Well , one does . - But it 's completely agreed that it feels good- - - for both parties , sir ? In an ideal world . - So people do it rather frequently . - How often , sir ? - Well , as often as they can , matter of fact . At least at first . Sir , may one speak frankly with you ? As always , Andrew . It 's just that the whole process- - It sounds so messy . I think that 's a fair comment . They die . Isn 't it ? What ? It 's called " humor . " " Humor " ? Yes . People tell jokes to make each other laugh . And this laughter gives pleasure , sir ? Yes . Sir , could you teach one to tell a joke ? Well , l-let 's see . Um- - two drunks walk into a bar . Wouldn 't two drunks walk out of a bar , sir ? You walk into a bar to drink , and you come out drunk . Let 's try something simpler , Andrew . Um- - - Knock-knock . - " Knock-knock " ? No , knock-knock , someone 's at the door . - Shall one get it , sir ? - No , no . No . Y-you say , " who 's there , " Andrew . - Who 's there , Andrew ? - No , just " who 's there ? " One does not know , sir . Let 's start with something a little simpler , Andrew . Why did the chicken cross the road ? One does not know , sir . Possibly a predator was behind the chicken . Or , possibly , there was a female chicken on the other side , if it 's a male chicken . Or possibly a food source or , depending on the season , it might be migrating . One hopes there 's no traffic . To get to the other side . " To get to the other side . " Why is that funny ? So , what do you kids have planned for the day ? Probably stick with Andrew . What about you , miss ? I 'm gonna go play at my friend Natalie 's house . May one , sir ? Is now a good time ? What ? A good time for what ? Last night , sir taught one- - no , no , no . Don-don 't blame me , Andrew . Just go ahead . Thank you , sir . Two cannibals were eating a clown . One turns to the other and says , " does this taste funny to you ? " How do you make a hanky dance ? Put a little boogie in it . What is a brunette between two blondes ? Translator . Do you know why blind people don 't like to skydive ? It scares their dogs . A man with dementia is driving on the freeway . His wife calls and says , " sweetheart " , I heard there 's someone driving the wrong way on the freeway . " He says , " one ? There 's hundreds ! " What 's silent , smells like worms ? Bird farts . It must have been an engineer who designed the human body . Who else would put a waste processing plant next to a recreation area ? A woman goes into a doctor 's office . The doctor says , " mind if I numb your breasts ? " - " Not at all . " " Num-num-num-num-num . " One did it , sir . Andrew , it was fine , but we might want to talk about ... Appropriateness and , um- - and timing . It 's 10 : 15 , sir . * * - Andrew . - Little miss . Would you like me to teach you how to play a duet ? Certainly . Come on . Okay , ready ? You start here , and then just follow me . I play first , okay ? All right . Ready ? Your turn . * * Good . Very good . Now together . * * * * That was wonderful . Thanks . Thank you , little miss . * * Hi , mom . Grace , is it possible for you to find somewhere more private to do that ? No problem . Just give me your credit disc and we 'll get a hotel room . - What did you say to me ? - Let 's go . What did you say to me , young lady ? You get off that bike this minute , and you are grounded ! Get- - go on ! Get out of here , you piece of scum ! Richard ? Does this look right ? Hi , mom . Didn 't you talk to her about that boy ? Well , not yet . But I will . Kind of hoping it 's a phase that 'll pass , like the others . I am so sick of these damn clocks . I 've already given half them away . - Perhaps we should sell them . - Sell them ? Well , it 's an idea . Well , who gets the money ? Well , I imagine we will . But Andrew does all the work . Yes , but Andrew 's our- - then Andrew should get the money . Andrew is a robot . What conceivable use would a robot have for money ? Robots don 't go shopping . Robots don 't go on vacations . Robots don 't eat dinners in fancy restaurants . I can 't believe we 're having this discussion . Dad , it doesn 't matter what he is . Andrew deserves to benefit from the work he does . Sweetheart , I will do what 's right for Andrew . Of course I will . But at the end of the day we are talking about a machine , and you can 't invest your emotions in a machine . Right ? Can I get you anything ? No , thank you . There you are . How are ya ? Bill , good morning . This must be Andrew . Andrew , bill feingold , family lawyer . Andrew . You own one of my clocks . This is one of my favorites . Do you enjoy it ? Yes , I do , very much . - I like the new office , bill . What floor are we on here ? - Thirty-seven . Andrew , come and have a look at this . No , thank you , sir . - You sure ? - No . How can I help you ? As you know , Andrew 's earned a great deal of money from his endeavors , and what he really wants to do is open his own bank account . A bank account in the name of a robot ? Would that be legal ? I couldn 't say . There are no precedents . I don 't think there 's a law against it , but- - Richard , why- - why do you want to give him a bank account ? What 's he need money for ? To pay for things , of course , which otherwise sir would have to pay for . One would like to pull one 's own . - Weight . - For what , sir ? - Andrew . - Yes , little miss ? Ooh ! . I 'm so sorry . Not to worry . It can be repaired . Wow . - left . Andrew , remember Frank , my boyfriend ? Yes , the one your sister says has a nice ass . Last night- - Last night he asked me to marry him . One gathers that is a good thing . Well , I haven 't said " yes " yet . So there is doubt . No . Frank is wonderful . He 's handsome . He 's reliable . He 's somebody I could spend the rest of my life with . I could have children with him . Then what is the problem ? Board ? No , not at all . Not him- - there . Well , I have this friend ... That 's very special to me . He 's just so sweet and funny , and whenever I 'm with him ... I don 't want to be with Frank . One can see that would create a complication . Yes . But the answer 's staring you in the face . Marry your friend . What ? Well , he 's not- - I mean , h-he- - A relationship between us would be impossible , really . It could never work out . Why ? Well , because he 's not- - Because he-he 'll never be- - Yes ? Is something wrong ? No . Nothing 's wrong , nothing at all . Thank you for listening to me . One is glad to be of service . Little miss , what will you do about Frank ? Accept his proposal . Really ? Humans . Andrew , yes ? It would mean so much to me if you would be an Usher at my wedding . One is unfamiliar with this term . How does one " ush " ? You help people to their seats . You wear a tuxedo . - One would wear clothing ? - Yes . One has never been asked to wear clothing . It would be an honor . Great . One still is all thumbs . Installed what ? Um , an alarm . If you try to enter Andrew 's brain while you 're making this repair , the police will be alerted . Also , you should probably know that- - If you actually injure Andrew 's brain or positronic pathways in any way , my lawyer , the good Mr. feingold , will be happy to sue you . He will sue you for the lost value of Andrew 's income until the end of time . Well , I think we understand each other . Good . Sir , one more item of business . As long is one is in the shop , can you do work on one 's face ? One wishes to have more expression . One has thoughts and feelings that presently do not show . You want your thoughts and feelings to show on your face ? Yes , like the contempt that you are showing me right now . Well , we have done some experimentation . We are able to give robots superficial responses ... Which mimic human expression . One has read that there have been ndr upgrades . Yes , yes . We 've worked up a dozen experimental models with expression capabilities , sleeker body types . We ran some market surveys and decided not to go ahead with the line . Why not ? Negative consumer reaction . There 's a growing fear that robots will continue to make ... The human work force obsolete . Andrew has worked for me for over 15 years . There 's no danger of anyone losing their job to him . Surely there 's no concern performing these modifications on an old-style robot . True . But procedures like that would be prohibitively expensive . It is understood that you will attempt to rivet one . Screw , Andrew . Really ? How much ? That is roughly one 's monthly salary . It 's more than I make in a year . Not bad for- - What did you call him last time we were here ? Household appliance . - Household appliance ? - Household appliance , yes . May the peace of the lord be with you always . I now pronounce you husband and wife . You may kiss the bride now . It is my pleasure to present Mr. and Mrs. Frank charney . What ? Good evening , sir . Magnificent night . You look very sharp this evening , Andrew . Thank you , sir . It was quite challenging for the tailor . May one continue wearing clothing ? If it suits you . Are you serious ? As always . Well , I suppose so . We 'll have to find you some other stuff , though . You can 't wear tails all the time . Really ? How sad . Sit down , Andrew , please . Thank you , sir . - It was a wonderful wedding , wasn 't it ? - Yes , sir . And , if one may say , you are a spectacular dancer . - Well , that 's very kind . - Not at all , sir . It 's the truth . Did you record the day ? Every second , sir , is in one 's memory bank . Well , let 's watch it , shall we ? Sir ? Is everything all right ? Um- - They 've both gone now , Andrew . Well , things change . Things always change . People move on . It 's as it should be . But , what I realized today is that , I 'll never stop missing them . Sir ? One is still here . And one is glad of that , Andrew . Thank you . Good night , sir . Good night , Andrew . Lloyd ! Come here . What did I tell you about throwing sand at people ? What did I tell you ? Now apologize to Andrew . I will not apologize to it . Him . It . Lloyd . Sorry . One understands why some animals eat their young . I 'm so sorry , Andrew . Are you all right ? You seem very quiet . How does one obtain freedom ? - Y-you wish to leave us ? - Not at all , little miss . One merely wishes to be declared free . But why ? You have so much freedom here . Until one is ordered to do something . Andrew , it 's been years since anyone 's given you an order . But you may still request one to perform tasks . Well , we ask all the time , but it 's a request , not an order . But that 's not enough for you , is it ? One has studied your history . Terrible wars have been fought where millions have died ... For one idea : Freedom . And it seems that something that means so much to so many people ... Would be worth having . Sir , would now be a good time to speak with you ? It 's always a good time , Andrew . You know that . It is everything in one 's bank account . Why would you want to give me- - To purchase one 's freedom . One wants to be free . One would , of course , still obey the three laws ... And serve you in exactly the same fashion . The only thing that would change would be the form . One would no longer be your property . You want to leave . That 's what this is about , isn 't it ? Not at all , sir . You are one 's family . Then why ask for this ? I see . You 're in on this . We 've talked about it , yes . So you ordered him to do it , and he obeyed . No . He makes his own decisions . - But you put the idea in his head . - No , father , you did . You 've given him hundreds of books to read . It was simply a matter of time before he became intrigued by the idea of freedom . He learns and grows all the time , and it 's because of you and Andrew 's abilities ... That he 's become every bit as complex as we are . Good morning , sir . You take your check back , please , Andrew . Why , sir ? You are free now . I must ask you to leave this house . But sir , I don 't wish to leave . You wished for freedom , you must accept the consequences . Then I will remove my belongings . Yes . Where will you go ? I will look for a residence nearby ... So that if you ever need anything , sir- - That will not happen , Andrew , thank you . There 's no need to be close by . - If you command me not to do this , I will obey . - I command nothing . You 're free . Then- - called or uncalled- - I am always at your service . Andrew , you 've stopped referring to yourself as " one . " A home of my own . Andrew ? Andrew ? I 'm in here . Little miss . Is something wrong ? He asked for you . It 's time . - The robot 's here . - Andrew . Hello , miss . Andrew . Sir . - How are you , sir ? - Well , I 'm dying , Andrew . Otherwise I 'm fine . Wonderful to see you again . I 'm very happy to see you , Andrew . It 's been a long time . Yes , it has , sir . I wanted to- - I wanted to tell you ... That I was wrong . You 're never wrong , sir . Then don 't contradict me . You were right to want your freedom , and I 'm glad that you have it . Thank you , sir . Andrew , you were very good to us . It was an honor serving you , sir . I want to seek out my own kind . In order to understand my destiny , I must know if there is another like myself . Northam robotics will not return my inquiries , and now that you have finally passed the bar , Lloyd , I want you to sue them for information of the whereabouts of all ndr series robots , if you don 't mind . The freedom of information act doesn 't quite cover suits by robots . - Not yet . - Mother , I 'm a very busy man . I do not have time to help ... It pursue some ridiculous lawsuit . Lloyd , sweetheart , I do love you , but sometimes I have to wonder if you really are my child . Well , that 's mutation , mother . The miracle of genetics is I 'm not you . No , you 've always been more like your father . So that ' why you divorced him . Sorry . Andrew , what would you do if I got the information on these other ndrs ? I would seek them out , each and every one . So you 'd be gone for quite a long time . Yes . Several years if not more , if my calculations are correct . I 'd love to help you . Did he not breast-feed ? " Dear little miss , " my journey is nearing the end of its tenth year , " and I still have not found any robot that bears any similarity to myself . " I have thousands of Miles to go , hundreds of cities to visit , " so I have not given up hope . Love , Andrew . " Hello . My last name is Martin . Hey , get off the field . " Dear little miss , my journey is nearing its end . " I have exhausted all possibilities save for one final ray of hope . I 've learned of an ndr robot that has recently been rebuilt back home in San Francisco . " Take as many as you need . Then you should love them . I 'll be right back . Take as many as you need . Thank you . You 're quite welcome . * * * * * whoo * what you want baby , I got it * * whoo , whoo * what you need do you know I got it * * whoo , whoo * all I 'm askin * is for a little respect when you come home * * just a little bit * hey , baby when you get home * * just a little bit * just a little bit just a little bit * * mister * I ain 't gonna do you wrong while you 're gone * * ain 't gonna do you wrong if I don 't wanna * * whoo * whoo , whoo * all I 'm askin * is for a little respect when ya come home * * just a little bit * baby , when you get home * just a little bit * just a little bit just a little bit * * yeah * Hi . Is this yours ? Thank you . I 'm looking for Rupert burns . You 've come to the right place . Come in . Certainly have . Do you have a name ? Of course I do . Galatea . Galatea . You have an amazing ... Agility . You were dancing in the market . Did you like that ? Very much . Dancing is the sportiest sport , and we 're so much better at it than humans . I can 't believe I finally found you . When did you know ? Know what ? That you were unique . I knew that right away . Me too . You and I- - We 're the same . We have personality ! Is your personality chip turned on ? Isn 't yours ? No . Sucks to be you ! I think personality is much more fun than intelligence , don 't you ? * baby , baby , sweet baby . I think so . * there 's somethin that I 've just got to say * * can I help you ? Your robot is just a standard ndr , isn 't she ? Yeah , I 'm afraid so . Why does she have the ability to dance ? 'Cause I- - I put a modified skeletal chip into her during a rebuild . How were you able to do that modification ? My father taught me . He created the android unit at northam robotics . He 's responsible for the technology that allows you to mimic human expression . - What happened to him ? - Well , northam laid him off when they shut down the unit , so he started this place , and I took over when he died . I 'm sorry to hear that . He would have been absolutely thrilled to meet you . I-I-I 'm Rupert burns . It 's a real honor . The honor is mine . * * Hey ! You and I- - we 're the same ! Let 's get loco , robo ! Whoo-hoo ! Shut her off or I will . Okay . * * Thank you . Is this your father 's work ? Yeah- - well , it 's- - it 's our work , you could say . I haven 't really been able to restrain myself from continuing ... To tinker with the relentlessly unfashionable android technology . As a matter of fact , I 've actually gotten to a point ... Where I can pretty much exactly replicate the external physical appearance ... Of a human being . - Remarkable . - Thank you . - Amazing ! - Yeah . Unfortunately , nobody seems terribly interested in funding my research . - But- - - I am . I will fund your research . Yeah ? That 'd be cool . Thank you , darlin ' . Okay . Andrew , I want to make it very clear : This is an external physical upgrade only in the strictest sense of the word . You 'll feel nothing . None of your internal mechanisms will be changed . You 'll still be subject to the parameters of your positronic brain . Is that clear ? Understood . Okay , good . Now , have you given any thought whatsoever as to what age you 'd like to be ? Officially , I am 62 years old . Let 's take off 25 years . What do ya say ? Fifteen . Twenty . Good . Perfect . Now , Andrew , believe it or not , the secret to all this is actually ... Imperfection . Imperfection ? Yeah . Things like ... Wrinkles , less-than-perfect teeth , details like fading scars , little pockmark- - Look at my nose . See my nose ? It 's bulbous and slightly irregular ? It is . Well , I 'm the only one who 's got my nose , and that 's what makes me , me . We need to incorporate these features into your design ... So that you can be the only one of you . That 's what makes us unique , is those imperfections . I see . Like the shape of your head . - What about the shape of my head ? - It 's huge . But lovely . Thank you . - What happened ? - What 's going on ? What happened ? I saw the inner me . - Is it ready ? - Okay . Please , be careful . Don 't drop me . I 'm being careful . My God ! Just relax , relax , relax . Why did you do that ? That wasn 't very funny . Just keepin ' ya on your toes . I don 't have any toes . You do now . I do . And hands . And fingers . How do I look ? See for yourself . Thank you . * * Beautiful . Sorry . Who are you ? Andrew . Andrew ? You look wonderful , even younger . How do you do that ? Do-do I know you ? Well , I know I look different too . I 've had an upgrade . Touch it . What ? - No , no ! No . - Sorry , the face . What 's going on ? You leave her alone ! Who are you ? Andrew . No . Andrew ? Yes . But Andrew 's a robot . - Yes , I am . Well , now , an android . - He 's had an upgrade . I know that . Hello . Hello ! It is you . You know him ? Yes . You know me ? Yes . Who are you ? No ? I 'm little miss . Yes . That 's little miss . No . No ? No ? No . No , that 's portia . Portia ? Yes . Portia ? Yes . Who 's portia ? My granddaughter . Your granddaughter ? Yes . Yes . Is this some kind of trick ? No . You 're little miss ? Yes . Why do you have to look like her ? There is and can be only one little miss . Really ? Yes ! It 's a genetic resemblance . Sometimes it skips a generation . I don 't care . I don 't like it . I can see that . But if you took a moment , which I see you 're not inclined to do right now , you 'd realize portia and I are very different people . Why is she imitating you ? What 's so funny ? You are . I 'm not trying to be funny . Things have certainly changed around here . That happens after 20 years . I have so much to tell you . Come . Come with me . It I you . Yes . Portia . Hello , my friend . Hello , little miss . Whose daughter is she ? Lloyd 's . Now the rudeness makes sense . Go . Go home to your master . You don 't have a home , do you ? I don 't have food . I don 't eat . Come in . We 'll keep each other company . I know you don 't like me . Well , I don 't like you either . I just wanna make that clear . It couldn 't be more clear if you spat in my face . I can 't . I don 't have a mucous gland . Would it be possible to have a slightly longer conversation ? May my canine companion enter also ? Thank you . Is this your sculpture ? No , I 'm restoring it . I 'm a preservation architect . It 's quite horrendous . How ugly was it before you restored it ? - Listen . First , you get mad at me because of how I look . Tonight you show up at my door , announce that you don 't like me , and then you criticize my work . Once again , I apologize for telling the truth . But it can 't be helped . It 's my programming . What is it exactly that you want ? Family . My last name is Martin , I am so named because your great-grandfather and grandmother ... Considered me to be a member of your family . Now , sir is dead . Little miss is getting older . You don 't like me , but at least you 'll talk to me if I knock on your door long enough . Is that a joke ? No . Would you like to hear a joke ? This Buddhist walks up to a hot dog vendor and says , " make me one with everything . " Andrew , do you- - do you have any friends at all ? No . Only woofy , who 's very sweet , but not very challenging on a conversational level . That is the extent of his skills . So you want someone to talk to ? With . Even if that person doesn 't like you ? You can 't have everything . Is that right ? Is it , " you can have everything " ? Seems like some people do , so I 'm somewhat confused on that level . Sit down . Let 's talk . Thank you . Hey there , handsome . Andrew , could I get you anything to drink ? Sorry , I have no stomach . Could I get something for him ? He has a stomach . Yes . Do you think he 's hungry ? How is she ? She 's sleeping . What happened ? She had a stroke . There you are . Little miss . She 's gone ? It 's cruel that you can cry and I cannot . Here is a terrible pain I cannot express . Will every human being that I care for ... Just ... leave ? I 'm afraid so . That won 't do . Andrew , this is remarkably impressive . You did this all by yourself ? Yes . I downloaded every known medical textbook into my memory . I studied them . That 's how I came up with these drawings . I know they 're very primitive and not entirely complete , but that 's why I need you to fill in the mechanical gaps , Rupert . This is another upgrade . It 's considerably more than an upgrade . I mean , you 're- - You 're talking about a profound transition ... From the mechanical to the biological . I realize that , and I believe it is the ideal marriage of both fields . Not only that , but this stuff could cut both ways . I don 't think that any existing prosthetic devices or artificial organs ... Hold a candle to what you 've designed here . You could use these in human beings as well . Exactly . Wow ! * * What a piece of fecal matter . Shit . Excuse me ? What a piece of shit . I know that . No , that 's way you say when you 're frustrated . You say " piece of shit . " - " Piece of shit " ? - Yes , but-but with feeling . What a piece of shit . More . What a piece of shit ! Good , very good . Thank you . Now , are you aware that what you 've essentially designed here ... Is the equivalent of the human central nervous system ? That was my intention , yes . Okay . Well , you gotta realize that a nervous system is going to ... Radically enhance the way that you feel and perceive the world around you . I 'm not just talking about hot and cold and little tiny pinpricks . Put it this way : As your experience becomes varied , so will the feelings , emotions , sensations ... Stimulated by that experience . And while some of these will be very subtle ... And wonderful and nuanced and shaded , others will be profoundly intense and difficult to tolerate . Do you feel like you 're ready for that ? Absolutely . Lovely . Thank you . I was referring to the statue . I know . Could you fix this piece of shit ? I don 't know . Let me take a look . Andrew , I 'm sure you could restore this yourself . Yes , I could . But you could do it much better . Well , I 'd be happy to fix it for you . If it 's not too much effort . No , not at all . I 've been working all day , and I could really use some air . Do you wanna go for a walk ? That would be quite splendid . Yes . Why are you laughing at me ? You 're just- - you 're always so polite and so proper . It 's very sweet . Thank you . Let 's go . Thank you . * when a man 's an empty kettle * * he should be on his mettle * * and yet I 'm torn apart * * it 's because I 'm presumin' that I could be kinda human * * if I only had a heart * * picture me do you have an impact drill ? Yeah , over on the rack . Thank you . * * Jesus ! There 's a party next week ... To celebrate the opening of the building that I restored , and all my friends will be there , and it would be great if you could come . I would love to . Thank you . I think you 're letting me win .

" What ? Swine . Then the ballet is not swine lake ? God , nobody makes me laugh like you . Laughter is essential for a good friendship . Yes , it is . Sometimes I get the feeling that ... You feel a certain way about us ... And ... that you ... Wish or- - What ? I don 't know . It 's just a little- - Having this conversation with- - A robot ? Yes . I-I mean , a thing is itself , Andrew . A tree is a tree , water is water . You ... Are a magnificent machine . But no matter how much you change , that 's what you 'll always be . No , I can 't believe that , will not believe that . I realize I 'm not entirely human . That 's why people don 't always like or understand me . I like you . You do ? I even understand you ... Some of the time . But I- - I can 't invest my emotions in a machine . Must be a genetic trait . Things change , portia . Things always change . She laughed at me . " - A thing is itself , Andrew . - Water is water . " What about ice ? What about steam ? Andy , you gotta calm down , okay ? Do you know what it 's like to be laughed at ? Humiliating . It 's an abomination . Look at me . Look what I 'm doing here . I am trying to make something of myself . I am trying to fulfill my destiny . Does she notice ? Andrew ? Yes ? I don 't want you to take this personally , but I have to work now . Good night . Good ni- - Where 've you been ? I 've been trying to call you . Poke me in the eye . Poke me in the eye , portia . What ? You 're crazy . Poke me in the eye ! That hurts .. It works . What the hell is going on ? It 's my neural net . I am the proud owner of a central nervous system . You can feel . Yes , very much . Will you do something for me ? Will you perform an experiment just for the sake of science ? All right . Kiss me . No , not there . Here . Thank you . Could you feel it ? It 's wonderful . It 's everything they say it is . And you ? Portia , what 's wrong ? Charles and I are getting married . He 's a lucky man . Congratulations to the both of you . Goddamn it , Andrew . If you 're gonna succeed at this thing- - what thing ? This thing you 're trying to do- - you 've got to stop being so damn deferential . I can 't help being deferential . It 's built in . Then change . Change ? I have changed . I don 't mean on the outside . Change on the inside . Take chances , make mistakes . Mistakes ? Yes ! Sometimes it 's important not to be perfect , okay ? It 's important to do the wrong thing . Do the wrong thing ? Yes ! Why ? I see- - to learn from your mistakes . No , to make them . To find out what 's real and what 's not . To find out what you feel . Human beings are terrible messes , Andrew . I 'll grant you that . I see . This is what is known as an irrational conversation , isn 't it ? No , this is a human conversation . It 's not about being rational . It 's about following your heart . And that 's what I should do ? Yes . And you have a heart , Andrew . You do . I feel it . I don 't even believe it sometimes , but I do feel it . And in order to follow that heart , one must do the wrong thing . Yes . Thank you . Galatea , could you be a little more careful ? That 's very delicate equipment . Sorry . - What are you doing ? - Near as I can tell , your bitch work . My wha ? You heard me , and I 'm sick of it ! All day long it 's , " yes , Rupert , sir , " " no , Rupert , sir . " " Would you like another beverage , Rupert , sir ? " And it chaps my ass ! So here 's a helpful hint for you : Shut up , and let me do my work ! No , no . I 'm done . " Chaps my ass " ? Give me back the chip . Where 's the chip ? I replaced it . Andrew , she 's uncooperative , she 's abusive , she 's confrontational- - And a lot more interesting , don 't you think ? Arguably , but we 're not getting any work done , Andrew . Please , please , give me the old personality chip back . Fine . She can be perky again . Perky ? She 's just a ro- - I didn 't mean it that way . Andrew ? Andrew ! I really didn 't mean that . What 's the matter with you today ? Andrew , where you going ? * * Hey , Jamie , come over here . I want you to meet Charles . Charles , my aunt Jamie . Hi , nice to meet you . This is Ryan . Hey , Ryan . This is Michael . The boys are great . Rupert ! What 's going on ? What 's going on ? Portia 's parents are throwing an engagement party ... That I wasn 't invited to for obvious reasons . Yeah . There he is . Who ? The prospective groom . Where ? Where ? The one in the pale blue suit with the big pointy chin . He 's got a pointy chin ? Pointy chin ? You could put an eye out with that chin . Yeah , that 's nothing compared to his teeth . Look at that . I 'm amazed he 's out in daylight . He 's got funny teeth ? You need to upgrade your eyes . That shouldn 't stop portia . She can marry whoever she likes . It 's just that one day she 's gonna wake up next to him and realize ... That she is married to a man whose face closely resembles an antique can opener . You know ? The kind that used to go- - You know ? The ones that move around and can pops off . You 're jealous . You are jealous . No , I 'm not . No , I 'm not . You are . Otherwise what are you doing sneaking around here , spying on portia ? My God , I am jealous . If I 'm jealous , that means I 'm in love . Hi ! Thanks for coming . If I 'm in love , then all hope is gone . I 've lost her . Andrew . Andrew ! Andy , would you like a sip of my beer ? It would be a waste . I could not taste it . What if you could ? It would be exquisite . I 've come up with a design- - A modification , rather- - That , if I 'm correct , would enable you to deal with solid foods and liquids . And taste ? Taste too . And also , If my schematics are correct , I think I 've come up with a method ... To make you ... A complete man . Complete ? Complete . Complete ? Not in a reproductive sense , of course , but in terms of approximating ... The physical sensation , you know , that occurs- - Friction- - Sexual relations . Yeah . I 've always been fascinated by that . Well , I mean , curious ... Because- - Well , because of what they say . What do they say ? That you can lose yourself- - Everything , all boundaries , all time- - The two bodies can become so mixed up ... That you don 't know who 's who or what 's what . And just when the sweet confusion is so intense you think you 're gonna die , you kind of do , leaving you alone in your separate body . But the one you love is still there . That 's a miracle . You can go to heaven and come back alive . You can go back anytime you want- - With the one you love . And you want to experience that ? Yes , please . So do I. We 'll have to hire more people . Maybe two more weeks . Andrew . Excuse me . I 'll be right back . Sure . I didn 't expect to see you . I remember this place very well . This is where your grandmother was married . Yeah , I wanted it ready for my own wedding . So , you 're not married yet ? No , two weeks from Saturday . I 'm not too late . Are you absolutely positive you 're doing the right thing ? Positive ? About getting married ? I 'm never absolutely positive . So you could be doing the wrong thing . No , I 'm pretty sure I 'm doing the right thing . Great . Why is that great ? In your apartment , you told me to do the wrong thing . Now , you are not doing the wrong thing . You 're doing the right thing . It 's safe to say you 're not following your own advice , 'cause if you were , you would definitely not be marrying this man , Charles . Because I would be doing the right thing . Precisely . In some strange way , you 're starting to make sense . Good . Do you have any idea what it 's like to be in love with someone ... Who 's about to marry someone else ? Someone totally magnificent , someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun ? Someone who you know is lying to herself ? Lying ? Convincingly , yeah . Very , very much so . About what ? That you don 't love me , when I know at least in some way you do . And how do you know that ? Portia , I have done everything inside and out . But that stuff doesn 't matter to me . Well , something matters , 'cause I 'd have to believe if nothing mattered , you 'd love me ... And not some man whose chin could sink the Titanic . What ? See ? It 's true , isn 't it ? I 'm sorry . Does he light you up like this ? Does he make you laugh ? Nobody makes me laugh like this . Good . Then admit it . Admit that you love me . Give me one kiss . God . That 's all . One quick kiss . Just one kiss ... Could not jeopardize a glorious marriage . Besides , it would also explain to me why your pulse jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute . Your respiration rate has doubled . You 're putting out clouds of pheromones . It 's not fair to read me like that . I know . Love isn 't fair . I 'm reading your heart . I 'm asking you to follow it- - begging you . Begging is supposed to be humiliating . I don 't care . I love you , portia . I loved you the very first moment I saw you . I thought you said a quick kiss . I lied . How do you feel ? Wonderful . So do I. I guess that 's the point . What was that ? That 's your stomach growling . You 're hungry . Was that me ? Yes . I thought it was you . No , it wasn 't me . Really ? Ooh . Do you do that ? Sometimes . Quieter than that . I 'll have to have Rupert make me a muffler . It 's wonderful . It 's wonderful- - the taste and the texture both . You know , it 's marvelous . I know this will be my fourth helping , but may I please have some more ? Pig- - very smart animal . Obviously not that smart if it ends up as bacon . I feel like I 'm eating my way through the entire food chain . Thank you . What ? What 's wrong ? If we 're together- - You and me- - We 'll never be accepted . Because I 'm not human . That will not do . I will have to get started . Started with what ? The next step . I love you . Wish me luck . Andrew Martin , step forward , please . So , Mr. Martin , you would like us to pass a bill ... Declaring you a human being . Yes , specifically the ability to marry ... A fellow human being . I see . We have to face the undeniable fact ... That no matter how much you may be like a human being , you are not part of the human gene pool . You are outside of it entirely . You are something else , something artificial . Sir , what about all the real people wading in the gene pool ... Who have bodies full of prosthetic devices , many of which I have invented . You yourself , sir , have one of my kidneys , do you not ? Are you not in some way artificial , at least in part ? In part , yes . Well , then , I 'm human in part . Which part , Andrew ? This one , sir . I see . And here ? It is true I am still equipped with a positronic brain . And because of that positronic brain , you are , for all accounts , immortal . Yes , sir . Well , Andrew , society can tolerate an immortal robot , but we will never tolerate an immortal human . It arouses too much jealousy , too much anger . I 'm sorry , Andrew . This court cannot and will not validate your humanity . I hereby bring an end to these proceedings . It is the decision of this court ... That Andrew Martin from this day forward ... Will continue to be declared a robot- - A mechanical machine , nothing more . One is glad to be of service . Andrew , I have to tell you ... I 'm beginning to feel not so sure . About us ? No . Next week will be my 75th birthday . I know , and you look 50 . Thank you . A spectacular 50 . But I don 't feel 50 . Your body does . Last night was amazing . What was that called again ? Shut up and listen to me . Sorry . And don 't give me that look . I 'm not ordering you around . Whatever you say . Please don 't be agreeable . I 'm not being agreeable . I can be if you want . Goddamn it , Andrew , I 'm trying to tell you something important here . I 'm not going to live forever . Yes , you will . That 's why I invented- - No , no , I won 't always take your d.N.A. Elixirs . I won 't have all my organs replaced . Eventually I 'm going to wear out . And I want to . Why would you want to leave ? There 's an ... Order to things . Human beings are meant to be here for a certain time and then pass on . That 's what 's right . I see . There 's just one problem , portia . What ? I couldn 't stand to live without you . Andrew , people grow through time , but then , of course , for you time is a completely different proposition . For you , time is endless . There 's only one thing to do . Galatea , my dear , where are we ? The transfusion is almost complete . Is that so ? Just goes to show you , Andrew , somebody becomes a human being , sooner or later , they do something monumentally stupid . You 've been a great example , Rupert . How quickly will the blood degrade my system ? I don 't know . You exercise , eat right , I 'd say 30 , 40 years . That 's a little vague , chief . You don 't know exactly how long I 'll last ? Sorry . Welcome to the human condition . Andrew Martin- - I have always tried to make sense of things . There must be some reason I am as I am . As you can see , madam chairman , I am no longer immortal . You have arranged to die ? In a sense , I have . I am growing old , and my body is deteriorating , and , like all of you , it will eventually cease to function . As a robot , I could 've lived forever . But I tell you all today , I would rather die a man ... Than live for all eternity as a machine . Why do you want this ? To be acknowledged ... For who and what I am- - No more , no less . Not for acclaim , not for approval . The simple truth of that recognition- - This has been the elemental drive of my existence , and it must be achieved , if I am to live or die ... With dignity . Mr. Martin , what you are asking for is ... Extremely complex and controversial . It will not be an easy decision . I must ask for your patience ... While I take the necessary time to make a determination ... Of this extremely delicate matter . I await your decision , madam chairman . Thank you for your patience . We tried . Is it almost time ? In a few minutes . It doesn 't matter what the world congress says . Why do you need their approval ? Old habit . I started my existence as a robot . I still like to be told certain things . It 's time . Ladies and gentlemen , Ms. Marjorie bota , president of the world congress . According to records of the northam robotics company , the robot , also known as Andrew Martin , was powered up at 5 : 15 P.M. , on April 3 , 2005 . In a few hours , he will be 200 years old , which means that , with the exception of methuselah and other biblical figures , Andrew is the oldest living human being in recorded history . For it is by this proclamation ... That I validate his marriage to portia charney ... And acknowledge his humanity . Andrew ? I 'm sorry he didn 't see it . Maybe he didn 't need to . Could you do me a favor ? Would you mind unplugging me ? That 's an order . Thank you , galatea . As the great Andrew Martin used to say , " one is glad to be of service . " I 'll see you soon . * laugh and cry * live and die * life is a dream * we all dream it * day by day * I find my way * look for the soul * and the meaning * then you look at me * and I always see * what I have been searching for * * I 'm lost as can be * then you look at me * and I am not lost anymore * people run * sun to sun * caught in their lives * ever flowing * one sweet dawn * life goes till it 's gone * we have to go * where it 's going * then you look at me * and I always see * what I have been searching for * * I 'm lost as can be * then you look at me * and I am not lost * anymore * and you say you see * when you look at me * the reason you love life so * * though lost I have been * I find love again * and life just keeps on running * * and life just keeps on running * * you look at me * and life holds love for * you * for * you *

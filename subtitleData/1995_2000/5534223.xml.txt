 [ Gunfire , Explosions ] dddd [ Rock ] dddd [ Man Singing , Indistinct ] dddd [ Owl Hooting ] BOBBY ? PHIL . I 'VE HAD IT WITH THAT KID , PATTI . I 'VE ALREADY TALKED TO HIM . YEAH , LIKE HE EVER LISTENS . [ Video Game : Explosions , Gunfire ] [ Loudly ] DID YOU HEAR ME CALLING YOUR NAME ? GET UP ! [ Pants ] WHAT ARE YOU DOIN ' ? YOU THINK THIS IS WHY I GO TO WORK EVERY DAY SO YOU CAN SIT ON YOUR ASS ? WHAT DID I DO ? WHAT 'D YOU DO ? YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING . THAT 'S THE PROBLEM . WHAT KIND OF A LOSER ARE YOU GONNA TURN OUT TO BE ? PUT YOUR BOOTS ON . [ Thunder Rumbling ] YOU DON 'T LEAVE MY TOOLS OUT IN THE RAIN . TOOLS ARE FOR WORK . THEY COST MONEY . ALL RIGHT , I 'LL PUT IT AWAY . AFTER YOU 'VE FINISHED . PICK IT UP . I 'M NOT GONNA LET YOUR MOTHER WATCH YOU GROW UP TO BE SOME KIND OF A JERK . FINE . I 'LL PUT IT AWAY ... PHIL . NO WAY . YOU 'LL FINISH THE JOB . NOW . [ Exhales ] GET AWAY FROM ME ! - GET AWAY FROM ME NOW ! - BOBBY ! [ Grunts ] BOBBY ! WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? COME BACK HERE , BOBBY ! I 'M CALLING YOU ! CAN 'T YOU HEAR ME ? BOBBY ! BOBBY ! [ Indistinct Shouting ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Shouting Continues ] BOBBY ! BOBBY ! BOBBY ! BOBBY ? BOBBY ! [ Grunting ] [ Thunderclap ] BOBBY ! BOBBY ! [ Grunting ] NO . TWELVE POUNDS , NINE OUNCES . ALL THAT CAME OUT OF HIS STOMACH ? MOST OF IT . THE SMALL AMOUNT IN HIS LUNGS IS WHAT KILLED HIM . IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE TOOK THE TERM " MUD PIE " LITERALLY ? I 'M SURE IF MR. RICH WERE ALIVE , HE WOULD FIND SOME HUMOR IN THAT . ACCORDING TO HIS POLICE REPORT , MR. RICH WAS A MAN WHO COULD TELL A JOKE . HE GREW UP HERE , WORKED THE SAME FIELDS FOR 20 YEARS . WELL LIKED AROUND TOWN . FUNNY HE SHOULD TURN UP MURDERED . IS THAT WHAT YOU CONCLUDED ? I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THIS MAN 'S HEAD WAS HELD FORCIBLY ... DOWN IN THE MICHIGAN MUD JUST A LITTLE TOO LONG , MOST LIKELY BY HIS STEPSON WHO WAS NAMED IN THE REPORT AS BOBBY RICH , AGE 16 . ACCORDING TO THE SAME REPORT , THE CORONER HAD TO HIRE A BACKHOE ... TO REMOVE THE BODY , WHICH WAS BURIED COMPLETELY IN A STANDING VERTICAL POSITION . THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT HIS STEPSON MAY HAVE DUG THE HOLE ... AND THAT A RECENT RAINSTORM MAY HAVE HELPED TURN IT INTO A MUDDY TRAP . - SOME RAINSTORM . - THEY SAY IT RAINED 400 INCHES A DAY . NOW , THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN EXAGGERATION , DON 'T YOU THINK ? WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SHOW HOW HE MAY HAVE DONE IT ? HOW A 6 ' 4 " , 250-POUND MAN WAS BURIED ALIVE ... IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES BY A 16-YEAR-OLD KID ... WHOSE CLASSMATES LOVINGLY REFER TO AS " DORK WEED " ? HE MAY HAVE HAD AN ACCOMPLICE . " ICH BIN EIN AUSLANDER . " " I AM AN OUTSIDER . " WHEN KENNEDY TOLD THE GERMANS " ICH BIN EIN BERLINER , " HE WAS ACTUALLY SAYING " I 'M A COCKTAIL SAUSAGE . " WHO 'S KENNEDY ? I 'M NOT HERE TO ACCUSE YOU OF ANYTHING , BOBBY . WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR , THEN ? I WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORY . I TRIED TO HELP . I COULDN 'T . WELL , THE POLICE AREN 'T ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT THAT 'S THE TRUTH . SO , WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT IT ? THEY WANT ME TO CONFESS SO THEY HAVE SOMEONE TO BLAME . RIGHT . BUT , YOU SEE , YOU 'RE NOT MAKING IT VERY EASY FOR THEM TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE . YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ? [ Clears Throat ] WHAT CAN I SAY ? EVERYBODY KNOWS I HATED HIM . THEY WERE REAL CLOSE WHEN BOBBY WAS LITTLE . ALWAYS KIDDING AROUND AND STUFF . BUT BOBBY SORT OF GOT INTO THAT TEENAGE STAGE , AND HE DON 'T WANT TO LISTEN TO NOBODY . AND THAT CAME TO A HEAD LAST NIGHT ? PHIL WAS LATE COMIN ' HOME . HE 'D BEEN STRESSED OUT 'CAUSE OF THE BLIGHT AND STUFF . HOW DO YOU MEAN ? THE HAZELNUT TREES ALL GOT A DISEASE . AND ... BOBBY DON 'T HELP THINGS OUT WITH HIS ATTITUDE AND STUFF . DID PHIL INSTIGATE WHAT HAPPENED ? IT 'S HARD TO TELL WHAT STARTS THESE THINGS . PHIL COULD BE STERN , JUST LIKE HIS OWN FATHER WAS TO HIM ... BUT I NEVER SAW HIM RAISE HIS HAND . AND WHEN I SAW HIM LYING IN THE MUD , I HALF-EXPECTED HIM TO PULL ME IN , LIKE HE HAD PLANNED IT OR SOMETHING . DID HE EVER HURT YOU ? PHIL , HE USED TO GET OFF SHOVING ME AROUND , YEAH . DID YOU EVER SHOVE HIM BACK ? [ Laughs ] HE 'S TWICE AS BIG AS ME . THAT 'S WHY SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE DUG THE HOLE , OR ATTACKED HIM WHEN HE FELL IN THE HOLE , 'CAUSE HE WAS DOWN THERE . THAT 'S THEIR PROBLEM , ISN 'T IT ? DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD AT THE TIME ? I GUESS ... I FELT HE HAD IT COMIN ' . HE WAS KNEELING OVER PHIL , STRUGGLING REAL HARD AND STUFF . COULD YOU TELL THAT HE WAS DEFINITELY TRYING TO HELP HIM ? IT SEEMED THAT WAY TO ME . YOU KNOW , THERE 'S A STRONG CHANCE ... THE POLICE ARE GONNA ARREST YOUR SON FOR MURDER . I DON 'T SEE HOW . BUT IF THEY DO , AND IF THERE 'S EVIDENCE OF ABUSE THAT YOU 'RE NOT COMING FORWARD WITH , IT COULD HURT HIS CHANCES . I KNOW EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON , BUT I STILL DON 'T SEE NO REASON FOR THIS . THEY 'RE ALL DYING . ACCORDING TO BOBBY 'S MOTHER , THAT 'S THE BIG REASON WHY HER HUSBAND BLEW UP . HIS HAZELNUT ORCHARD WAS HIT WITH A BLIGHT . SO HE POUNDS THE KID ? AND THE KID POUNDS BACK . IS THAT WHAT SHE TOLD YOU ? WELL , NOT IN SO MANY WORDS . ACTUALLY , SHE WON 'T ADMIT TO ANY ABUSE IN THE HOUSE . I SUSPECT SHE 'S JUST TRYING TO MOVE ON AND PROTECT WHAT FAMILY SHE 'S GOT LEFT . THE KID SAYS HIS STEPFATHER TEED OFF ON HIM REGULARLY . IS THAT HIS EXCUSE ? NO , THAT 'S HIS EXPLANATION . HE SAYS HE 'S INNOCENT . WHAT DO YOU THINK ? I THINK HE 'S A HARD KID TO LOVE . I 'M STILL FINDING IT HARD TO RECONCILE THE FACTS WITH THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE . EVEN IF HE DIDN 'T DIG THIS HOLE , THE DISEASE COULD HAVE KILLED ROOT SYSTEMS , CREATING WEAKENED SOIL . THEN HOW DID THE VICTIM SWALLOW 12 POUNDS OF THIS STUFF ? WELL , WHEN YOU FIGHT FOR AIR , A VACUUM IS CREATED . AND MAYBE ONCE HE SUCKED DOWN A MOUTHFUL OF MUD , IT TURNED HIS ESOPHAGUS INTO A SIPHON . AND WITH HIS HEAD PUSHED DOWN , IT FILLED ALL OF HIS PASSAGES LIKE A GAS CAN . WELL , YOU ASKED ME FOR ANSWERS . THOSE ARE THE BEST ONES I 'VE GOT . DID YOU ASK IF ANYBODY ELSE MIGHT BE INVOLVED ? HIS MOTHER SAYS THAT BOBBY CAN 'T MAKE FRIENDS . HE 'S BEEN IN THERAPY FOR HIS ANGER SINCE 1995 . THAT COULD BE ME . - WHAT IS IT ? - SOMEONE 'S WATCHING US . SIR ? HELLO ? WHO WAS IT ? I DON 'T KNOW . HE 'S GONE . [ School Bell Rings ] [ Students Chattering ] LISA . WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? I CALLED YOU LAST NIGHT . HOW COME YOU DIDN 'T CALL ME BACK ? THEY 'RE SAYING YOU KILLED HIM , BOBBY . I FINALLY STOOD UP TO HIM . PSYCHO ! THINK FAST . JUST GET AWAY FROM ME , OKAY ? OR WHAT ? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO , HUH ? MAYBE I 'LL KILL YOU TOO , HUH ? [ Boy Chuckling ] PSYCHO KILLER ! SEE ? ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS STAND UP . I 'LL SEE YOU LATER , THEN . [ Knock At Door ] [ Mulder ] KARIN MATTHEWS ? [ Door Opens ] [ Woman ] YES ? [ Scully ] WE 'RE AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY FROM THE F.B.I. I HOPE MY DIRECTIONS WERE CLEAR . I 'M A LITTLE TUCKED AWAY . I FIRST WORKED WITH BOBBY AFTER AN INCIDENT AT SCHOOL . HE 'S HAD DIFFICULTY DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS , AND THIS DIFFICULTY HAS CAUSED HIM TO ACT OUT . IN WHAT WAY ? BY PUTTING ON CERTAIN AIRS , AFFECTING AN ATTITUDE ... THAT HAS DRAWN THE WRONG KIND OF ATTENTION TO HIMSELF . I 'VE SEEN HIM COME IN HERE PRETTY BEATEN UP . PHYSICAL VIOLENCE ? MORE THAN JUST KID STUFF . WAS HIS STEPFATHER EVER INVOLVED ? I 'M NOT FREE TO SPEAK WITH PERFECT FRANKNESS , OF COURSE . IF YOU KNOW THAT BOBBY COMMITTED A CRIME , YOU 'RE UNDER LEGAL OBLIGATION TO TELL US . BOBBY ONCE SPILLED A GLASS OF MILK AT DINNER . FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS , HE WAS FORCED TO EAT IN THE CELLAR . NO TABLE , NO CHAIR , NO LIGHT . SOMETIMES HE WAS LEFT DOWN THERE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING . YOU SEE , THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF CRIMES , NOT JUST THE ONES YOU MIGHT FIND REASON TO INVESTIGATE . SO YOU 'RE SAYING BOBBY WOULD HAVE GOOD REASON TO KILL HIS FATHER ? I 'M SAYING THERE ARE SOME CRIMES WHERE THERE ARE ONLY VICTIMS . YOU 'RE FREE NOT TO ANSWER , MISS MATTHEWS , OR YOU 'RE FREE TO MAKE THESE VAGUE ALLUSIONS , BUT YOUR EVASIVENESS IS ONLY GONNA LAND THIS KID IN JAIL FOR A LONG , LONG TIME . I 'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND . YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A JUSTIFICATION , LIKE BOBBY DID IT , AND I DON 'T THINK HE DID . dddd [ Car Stereo : Rock ] HEY , WHAT ARE YOU DOIN ' ? GOING HOME . WELL , I , UH- - I WAITED FOR YOU . I THOUGHT , UH , WE WERE GONNA TALK , SO- - YOU SCARED ME TODAY , BOBBY . WHY ? WAS IT BECAUSE I STOOD UP FOR MYSELF , OR , UM ... BECAUSE I DIDN 'T LET THEM BEAT ME UP LIKE USUAL ? I GOTTA GO . YOU GOTTA STAND UP , LISA . YOU GOTTA TELL YOUR DAD YOU 'RE NOT GONNA PUT UP WITH THIS CRAP . THERE 'S A WAY ... TO MAKE IT GO AWAY ... FOREVER . [ Dog Barking In The Distance ] [ Door Opens ] WHAT THE HELL BUSINESS YOU GOT WITH HIM ? NOTHING . HE 'S JUST A FRIEND . [ Door Opens ] I DON 'T WANT YOU SEEING THAT KID . I DON 'T WANT HIM COMING ROUND HERE . DO YOU HEAR ME ? STOP IT , OKAY ? I 'M DOING WHAT 'S RIGHT FOR YOU . JUST SHUT UP ! [ Muffled Yelling ] [ Panting ] [ Gasps ] [ Sobbing ] [ Bird Cawing ] THE VICTIM 'S NAME WAS ... EUGENE BAIOCCHI , 40s . HE WAS A FOREMAN FOR ONE OF THE LOCAL GROWERS , A SINGLE PARENT . DID YOU GET A LOOK AT THE BODY ? IT HAD ALREADY BEEN REMOVED . I THINK IT 'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT KILLED HIM , THOUGH . FROM WHAT THEY PUT TOGETHER , THEY 'VE ALL BUT CONCLUDED HE WAS PUSHED OUT THE WINDOW . - PUSHED OUT ? - HIS DAUGHTER LISA MADE THE 9-1-1 CALL AT 8 : 08 P.M. SHE SAYS SHE AND HER FATHER HAD A FIGHT . - ABOUT WHAT ? - BOBBY . I DON 'T WANT YOU TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING , ALL RIGHT ? I 'LL BE HERE FOR YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE . BUT THEY 'RE GOING TO COME AND ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS , AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE . IF YOU DON 'T FEEL COMFORTABLE ANSWERING THEM , THEN I DON 'T WANT YOU TO ANSWER THEM . CAN I HAVE A MOMENT WITH LISA ? WAS LISA ANOTHER OF YOUR CLIENTS ? LISA ? YES , FOR FOUR YEARS . WHAT WERE YOU TREATING HER FOR ? AN EATING DISORDER . HAVE YOU ASKED HER WHAT HAPPENED ? ISN 'T THAT YOUR JOB ? WE GATHER THAT SHE HAD A FIGHT WITH HER FATHER OVER BOBBY RICH . WELL , IT DOESN 'T SURPRISE ME . LISA 'S FATHER WAS VERY DISAPPROVING OF HER GENERALLY , WHICH STEMMED TO A LOT OF HER PROBLEMS . HAD YOU COUNSELED HER FATHER ? NO . MY APPROACH IS WITH THE VICTIMS SOLELY , TO ALLOW THEM TO EMPOWER THEMSELVES . IN WHAT WAYS ? BY BREAKING THE CYCLE OF ABUSE , BY OWNING IT , BY CONFRONTING IT AND BY STANDING UP AGAINST IT . IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING . WHEN I TOLD LISA HER AUNT WAS COMING TO PICK HER UP TOMORROW , SHE STARTED TO CRY . IT WASN 'T OUT OF SORROW . THREE GUESSES WHO FOLLOWED LISA HOME LAST NIGHT ... AND WAS SITTING OUT FRONT IN HIS FATHER 'S TRUCK JUST MINUTES BEFORE THIS HAPPENED . - DOES SHE THINK BOBBY DID IT ? - SHE THINKS HE 'S QUITE CAPABLE . I THINK WE 'RE ALL QUITE CAPABLE . SHE SAYS THAT HE ALSO THREATENED TO KILL A BOY IN SCHOOL YESTERDAY . COME HERE . TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . IF LISA 'S FATHER WAS PUSHED OUT THE WINDOW , THEN ALL THE GLASS WOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE . THERE 'S GLASS HERE ON THE INSIDE . THE PAINT ON THE MULLIONS IS CRACKED ON THE OUTSIDE , NOT ON THE INSIDE HERE . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE SOME FACTS HAVE BEEN ASSUMED . IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE LISA 'S FATHER WAS PULLED OUT THE WINDOW , NOT PUSHED . HOW ? THAT I DON 'T KNOW . WELL , THERE 'S NOWHERE TO STAND . EVEN IF HE DID USE A LADDER , THERE 'D BE NO LEVERAGE . I MEAN , ESPECIALLY FOR A SCRAWNY 16-YEAR-OLD KID . THAT 'S MY POINT EXACTLY . SODIUM HYDROXIDE AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID . ALL RIGHT , CLASS . THERE WILL BE A QUIZ ON THIS TOMORROW . - MAY I HELP YOU ? - I 'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT . I NEED TO ASK YOU TO COME WITH US , PLEASE . - WHAT FOR ? - TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS . ABOUT WHAT ? I DON 'T WANT TO HAVE TO EMBARRASS YOU IN FRONT OF YOUR CLASS . WELL , I AIN 'T EMBARRASSED . [ Chuckling ] [ Students Murmuring ] I 'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THIS MAN DIED FROM A BROKEN NECK . BUT THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF BLOOD LOSS , WASN 'T THERE ? YES , BUT THE CUTS ALL MISSED THE ARTERY . I HAVE X RAYS IF YOU DON 'T BELIEVE ME . IT 'S THE FOURTH AND FIFTH VERTABRAE . HAVE YOU DETERMINED IF THE NECK INJURY WAS CAUSED BY THE FALL ? WELL , WHAT ELSE WOULD IT HAVE BEEN ? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS ? WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS HERE ? OH . ARE YOU SATISFIED ? [ Chuckles ] NO , I 'M NOT . MM. SCULLY . - WHAT IS THAT ? - EVIDENCE . OF WHAT ? ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO SCARE HIM ? NO , I THINK HE 'S SCARED ENOUGH AS IT IS . OF WHAT ? I 'LL HELP GET THE REST OF YOUR THINGS PACKED . BUT I THINK IT 'S BEST YOU GO TO YOUR AUNT 'S AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . WHEN DID SHE SAY SHE WAS COMING ? FIRST THING IN THE MORNING . HEY . FEEL IT . IT 'S OKAY . COME ON . [ Man ] YOU NEVER LEARN . [ Karin ] I 'M SORRY . PLEASE- - PLEASE JUST DON 'T YELL . WHAT WILL YOU EVER AMOUNT TO ? STOP IT . STOP IT ! WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? UP TO MY ROOM . [ Man ] YOU 'RE RUINING MY LIFE . YOU HEAR ME ? [ Footsteps ] I WISH YOU 'D NEVER BEEN BORN . WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ? THAT SPLINTER YOU 'RE HOLDING CAME FROM MR. BAIOCCHI 'S NECK , BUT IT DIDN 'T COME FROM THE BROKEN WINDOW . WHERE DID IT COME FROM ? IT 'S GREENWOOD . FRESH FROM A LIVING TREE . WHAT ? EXCUSE ME . IT 'S BEEN A FEW YEARS . YOU THINK THAT BOBBY CLIMBED THIS TREE TO PULL LISA 'S FATHER OUT OF THAT WINDOW ? IT KINDA BEGS THE QUESTION , DOESN 'T IT ? HEY , SCULLY , IS THIS DEMONSTRATION ... OF BOYISH AGILITY TURNING YOU ON AT ALL ? [ Rustling ] WHO ARE YOU ? I TAKE CARE OF THE TREES . SCULLY ? I DIDN 'T EXPECT YOU TO BE STANDING RIGHT THERE BEHIND ME . YOU WERE WATCHING US THE OTHER DAY IN THE ORCHARD . THE TREES ARE DYING . - SCULLY ! - MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME DOWN HERE , MULDER . DO YOU , UH , KNOW WHAT KIND OF TREE THIS CAME FROM ? SAME AS THIS TREE . YOU , UH , SAID THESE TREES WERE DYING . THIS SPLINTER 'S LIVE WOOD . [ Man ] TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENS . WHAT CAUSES THIS ? A VERY BAD MAN . [ Door Creaking ] [ Creaking ] [ Ground Sloshes ] [ Gasps ] [ Woman ] THE LITTLE SNOOP . SHE 'S JUST LIKE YOU . WHERE IS SHE ? [ Door Slams ] [ Knocking , Doorbell Rings ] MS. MATTHEWS , WE 'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS . ABOUT WHAT ? YOUR FATHER 'S DEATH . WE NEED TO CLARIFY A FEW DETAILS . MY FATHER ? HE DIED 20 YEARS AGO . YEAH , UNDER RATHER CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES . HIS BODY WAS PULLED FROM THE MUD OF AN ORCHARD ? I-I 'M SORRY . I WAS JUST A YOUNG GIRL , UH- - I DON 'T KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME . WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT YOU DIDN 'T BOTHER TO MENTION IT . I DON 'T SEE THAT IT MATTERS . WE SPOKE TO SOMEONE WHO THINKS IT DOES , SOMEONE WHO WORKED FOR YOUR FATHER . ACCORDING TO THE ORCHARD MAN , YOUR FATHER 'S DEATH BROUGHT ABOUT ... THE END OF A BLIGHT AFFECTING THE TREES . MY FATHER WAS A POWERFUL MAN , AND POWERFUL MEN ARE PRONE TO INSPIRE THIS KIND OF FANTASY . DON 'T TELL ME YOU 'VE BEEN TAKEN IN BY IT TOO . IS LISA STILL STAYING WITH YOU ? NO , SHE 'S NOT . SHE 'S GONE TO HER AUNT 'S . LOOK , I 'M SORRY I CAN 'T HELP . [ Engine Starts ] HELP ME ! I 'M DOWN HERE ! HELP ! LISA . LISA . KARIN ? KARIN ! KARIN . KARIN . LISA , YOU 'VE GOT TO BE QUIET , QUIET AS A MOUSE , OR HE 'S GOING TO HEAR YOU DOWN THERE . KARIN , I 'M SCARED . LET ME OUT , PLEASE . I WILL , BUT NOT UNTIL IT 'S SAFE . KARIN ? KARIN , I DON 'T WANT TO STAY DOWN HERE . PLEASE LET ME OUT ! [ Doorknob Jiggling ] KARIN . [ Departing Footsteps ] [ Door Closes ] MULDER , WHATEVER YOU 'RE HOPING WE FIND HERE , WITHOUT A COURT ORDER IT WON 'T BE ADMISSIBLE . I 'M NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE . [ Creaking ] MULDER , WHERE 'S THE BODY ? [ Knocking ] YES ? I 'M LINDA BAIOCCHI . LISA 'S AUNT . ARE YOU KARIN ? YES . - IS LISA HERE ? - NO . SHE WENT- - SHE 'S GONE TO THE BUS STATION . SHE HAS ? BUT IT WAS ALL ARRANGED . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU . I 'M SORRY . THERE MUST 'VE BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING . [ Glass Shatters ] [ Lisa ] HELP ME ! I 'M DOWN HERE ! [ Sobbing ] DON 'T LEAVE ! I 'M DOWN HERE ! AUNT LINDA , I 'M DOWN HERE ! - WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE ? - JUST GET ME OUT , PLEASE ! OKAY . I-IT 'LL BE OKAY . I 'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE . [ Gasps ] [ Crunching Sound ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] MULDER , YOU STILL HAVEN 'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION . WHAT HAPPENED TO KARIN 'S FATHER ? WHY WOULD ANYBODY STEAL HIS BODY ? I DON 'T THINK THIS WAS AN ACT OF GRAVE ROBBING , SCULLY . NO , THAT 'S WHAT WE WERE DOING . MORE LIKE AN ACT OF NATURE . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? THE ORCHARD MAN SAID THAT THE BLIGHT ... THAT PLAGUES THIS TOWN WAS CAUSED BY A MAN , IMPLYING A CONNECTION . I 'M A LITTLE AFRAID TO ASK WHAT KIND OF CONNECTION . BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF THIS VALLEY AND THEIR LIVELIHOOD- - THE TREES . LOOK AT THE VICTIMS , SCULLY . BOBBY 'S FATHER , LISA 'S FATHER- - AND KARIN 'S FATHER 20 YEARS AGO . ALL MEN WHO WORKED IN THESE ORCHARDS , THEIR LIVES AND DEATHS TIED TO THESE TREES . WE REMOVED THIS SLIVER OF GREENWOOD FROM LISA 'S FATHER 'S NECK . AND THE BRUISE THAT YOU FOUND ON BOBBY 'S FATHER 'S ANKLE COULD 'VE BEEN CAUSED BY A ROOT , THE SAME ROOT SYSTEM THAT PULLED KARIN 'S FATHER FROM HIS GRAVE . MULDER , THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE DEATHS , ONE THAT PROVIDES A CLEAR MOTIVE AND INTENT . THESE WERE ABUSED CHILDREN . WHO COULDN 'T DEFEND THEMSELVES . WHAT , SO NATURE DID IT FOR THEM ? SOMETHING DID IT FOR THEM , OR SOMEONE CONTROLLING NATURE . KARIN SAID SHE WAS COUNSELING BOBBY AND LISA TO EMPOWER THEM . I THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO THEM . I CALLED LISA AT HER AUNT 'S HOUSE 20 MINUTES AGO , AND THERE WAS NO ANSWER . - THEN WE SHOULD TALK TO BOBBY . - MULDER , WE 'VE ALREADY QUESTIONED HIM TWICE . MAYBE WE HAVEN 'T ASKED HIM THE RIGHT QUESTION . [ Engine Starting ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . YES , YOU DO . MAYBE YOU HATED YOUR STEPFATHER , BUT YOU DIDN 'T KILL HIM . YOU DON 'T HAVE IT IN YOU . THAT 'S GOOD . THAT 'S REALLY GOOD . CAN I GO NOW ? NO . YOU CAN 'T GO UNTIL YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH . FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE , PEOPLE ARE TAKING YOU SERIOUSLY , AND I THINK THEY SHOULD TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY . I THINK YOU 'RE A SERIOUS KID . YOU 'RE NOT AN OUTSIDER ANYMORE , HUH ? YEAH . I 'M THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR A.S.B. PRESIDENT . SO WHY DON 'T YOU JUST GIVE IT UP ? WHY DON 'T YOU GIVE IT UP ? WHY DON 'T YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT ? YOU TOOK THE SHOVEL TO HIM , BUT YOU COULDN 'T DO IT , SO YOU RAN . YOU RAN TO THE ORCHARD , BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU DUG A HOLE OR LAID A TRAP . BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID . NOT OF PHIL . YOU WEREN 'T AFRAID OF PHIL . PHIL NEVER HIT YOU OR HURT YOU IN THAT WAY . IN FACT , I THINK YOU WANTED TO HELP PHIL . [ Screaming ] YOU WANTED TO SAVE HIM . YOU DIDN 'T WANT PHIL TO DIE , DID YOU ? - [ Choking ] - [ Sniffles ] [ Grunting ] WHAT WERE YOU AFRAID OF ? I COULDN 'T DO IT . YOU COULDN 'T DO WHAT ? I COULDN 'T STAND UP TO HIM ... BUT SHE MADE ME- - SHE WHO ? KA- - KARIN . KARIN , SHE- - SHE MADE ME , UH- - YOU 'RE A LOSER ! YOU UNDERSTAND ME ? I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN BORN ! YOU 'RE RUINING MY LIFE ! KARIN MADE YOU WHAT ? SHE MADE ME SAY THOSE THINGS . SHE HAD ME PRETEND THAT I WAS HIM , THAT I WAS PHIL . SHE MADE YOU BELIEVE YOU WERE A VICTIM , BUT YOU WEREN 'T , WERE YOU ? SHE SAID I HAVE THE POWER ... TO- - TO MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY . BUT I- - BUT I DIDN 'T MEAN FOR HIM TO DIE . IT 'S OKAY . [ Footsteps ] [ Woman ] YOU THINK YOU CAN HIDE DOWN THERE ? YOU THINK YOU 'RE SAFE ? [ Altered Voice ] YOU 'LL WISH YOU WERE DEAD . KARIN ? SCULLY , TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . MULDER . TALK ABOUT PUTTING DOWN ROOTS . [ Scully ] WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE ? I THINK WE 'RE LOOKING AT KARIN MATTHEWS ' FATHER . BUT HOW DID HE GET HERE ? THE SAME WAY BOBBY 'S FATHER GOT PULLED DOWN IN THAT MUD . - MULDER , I- - - THIS HAS TO DO WITH KARIN , WITH HER OWN FATHER 'S ABUSE . IT WAS NEVER BOBBY THAT WAS LOCKED IN THE CELLAR . IT WAS KARIN . - KARIN CAUSED ALL THIS . - YOU THINK KARIN IS THE KILLER ? I THINK SHE 'S THE KILLER AND THE VICTIM . [ Lisa Groans , Shrieks ] [ Sobbing ] LISA . WHERE 'S KARIN ? [ Indistinct Muttering ] YOU 'RE GONNA BE OKAY . YOU STAY WITH HER , SCULLY . [ Tires Screeching ] [ Pounding On Door ] [ Latch Clicking ] - I NEED TO SEE BOBBY . - I 'M SORRY , BOBBY 'S NOT HERE . HE 'S IN DANGER ! GET AWAY FROM HERE , PLEASE . BOBBY ! HE 'S NOT HERE ! [ Groans , Shouts ] WHERE IS HE ? BOBBY ! BOBBY ! BOBBY ! - BOBBY ! - [ Panting , Grunting ] STAY AWAY FROM ME ! I 'M WARNING YOU . [ Creaking ] [ Gasping ] [ Altered Voice ] YOU 'RE PATHETIC . [ Grunting ] [ Bobby Gasping ] YOU LITTLE PIECE OF GARBAGE . KARIN , STOP ! - YOU STAY AWAY FROM HIM ! - STAND UP TO HIM ! KARIN DESERVES WHAT SHE GETS . [ Gasping ] MAKE HIM STOP , KARIN ! TELL HIM WHAT YOU SHOULD 'VE TOLD HIM 20 YEARS AGO . - YOU 'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE ! - KARIN 'S DEAD . IT 'S DONE NOW . NO MORE . [ Mulder ] COATS GROVE AUTHORITIES CONDUCTED A DETAILED EXAMINATION ... OF THE SOIL AND ROOT COMPOSITION IN THE RICH FAMILY ORCHARD , BUT COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT PULLED KARIN MATTHEWS ' BODY INTO THE MICHIGAN MUD ; NOR COULD THE AUTHORITIES DETERMINE HOW THE BODY OF KARIN 'S FATHER ... WAS PULLED FROM ITS GRAVE INTO HER ROOT CELLAR THREE YEARS EARLIER . WHILE THE FORENSIC DATA IS INCONCLUSIVE , I BELIEVE THE EXPLANATION LIES ... IN HOSPITAL RECORDS DATING BACK TO KARIN 'S CHILDHOOD , WHICH SUGGESTS SHE HERSELF WAS A VICTIM OF ABUSE . RAGE , UNCONFRONTED , TAKES ITS OWN PATH . I BELIEVE IT WAS KARIN 'S UNCONFRONTED RAGE ... THAT FORCED HER TO FACE HER BURIED FATHER . THIS SAME RAGE MADE HER IMAGINE VICTIMS IN THE CHILDREN AROUND HER , TRYING TO INSTILL IN THEM A STRENGTH SHE NEVER FOUND IN HERSELF . WHAT HAPPENED TO KARIN MATTHEWS IN THE ORCHARD THAT NIGHT WAS A RELEASE , RELEASE FOR A VICTIM WHO , UNABLE TO FACE UP TO HER OWN PAST , WAS FINALLY CONSUMED BY IT . [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

 * * Sit . Good boy . What 's the matter , Spike ? I could see . I could see . Spike , for a moment , I could see ! What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * $ 10,000 ? ! What , are you nuts ? ! An eight-to-one payback , guaranteed . By who ? By this guy I met . He imports computer chips from China . You met where ? At the Technology Expo at McCormick Place . China , Gare . Unexplored territory . But that 's not the point . The point is , it 's a chance for me to start from the ground floor . Well , not with our profits . Fine . If it 's a no , it 's a no . It 's a no . Fine . Just thought you might have more faith in your partner . Look , I-I 've told you this a thousand times . I - I 've already got an investment , and that 's McGinty 's , period . Is that all you aspire to ? Running a gin joint for your whole life ? Correction , I run the joint , you run around saving the world . And you help me . Exactly . I 'm living in your shadow . Oh , come on . No ! Gare , this is a chance for me to make my mark . Well , what do you say ? What do I say ? We 're here . Where ? Let 's see , the armored car comes around that corner , it goes too fast , hits another car , holds up traffic for hours . Armored car as in money armored car ? Uh , yeah . It 's old bills . They take them out of circulation . They 're burning bills ? Let me see that . Hey . Come on , Gary . No look , no help . For Pete 's sake . Thank you . " Yesterday , at Hartnett and Third , the armored car " toppled on its side , spilling approximately four million big ones . " Hey , Chuck . What ? That-that girl that I - I started seeing last year when I started getting the paper , that 's her . Oh , the one you could never find ? Yeah . I 'd see her everywhere , and then she 'd-she 'd just disappear . She 'd ju ... She had something to do with the paper , Chuck . I know it . Go get her , man ! I can 't ; I got this . See , that 's what I 'm talking about . I can handle it . Let me do it . I 'm sick and tired of being the second banana . You never give me a shot . And it 's a perfect opportunity . Hey ! Hey ! Can you believe it ? ! Look , it wasn 't my fault . I stepped in the street , I waved my arms , and the truck swerved to avoid hitting me . It was meant to be . It was fate . All right . Nobody got hurt . They could have . Yeah , but they didn 't . Hey , you guys hear what happened over on Hartnett a little while ago ? Yes . Yes . Hey , can I have a cup of coffee , please ? Look , the-the point of the matter is , you blew it . You 're forgetting something , pal . I went out of my way to do you a favor , okay ? I 'm the one that could 've gotten hurt . Lots of luck getting that money back . It 's a feeding frenzy out there . People are snatching up cash like monkeys grabbing peanuts . You didn 't . What ? I 'm insulted . You t ... Hey , Hobson . Hey . Marissa needs you in the office . She says it 's important . What 's ... what is it ? I don 't know . Ask her . I saw something . All right , Marissa , slow down . I can 't . Marissa . I saw something , Gary . Well , if-if you saw something , that 's-that 's incredible . I know it is , but it happened ! I 'm sure of it ! All right , well , Marissa - All right , well , tell me what happened . Okay . I was out for a walk , and then there was light and shapes . Gary , I 'm telling you , for a moment , I was actually seeing . Marissa , is , is that possible ? I don 't know . But it happened . It happened for a few seconds , and then it was ... it was dark . And - gosh , my hands are still shaking . Gary , what do I do ? Well , this is all quite something , isn 't it ? Yes , it is . Did you find something ? Now , of course , this is only a preliminary ... But you found something , right ? There 's nothing , Marissa . Your condition 's unchanged . Your physical indications are what they 've always been . There 's no sign of any ... That can 't be . I saw something . Marissa , vision is-is a very complex thing . It-it 's not a switch that turns on and off . You know , we , we see in our dreams , in our imaginations . But I wasn 't dreaming ! I saw something . It was , it was bright . It was a letter . A letter . Can I have a pen and paper , please ? I remember in elementary school we had to learn the alphabet by their shapes . And I 'm not quite sure what letter it is , but ... There is no such letter . Well , what are you talking about ? It 's , uh ... It 's not a letter . Marissa , has there been anything unusual in your life ? Something , uh , especially stressful ? You don 't believe me ! Well , now , I-I didn 't say that . You don 't have to ! But I know what happened , and I saw something . Marissa , wait , now . I can 't wait . I have things to do . Well , listen , he 's just telling you what he knows . That 's not what I heard ! What I heard was condescending , as if I were a child with some imaginary friend . It 's a professional opinion , that 's all . Opinions I don 't need , Gary . I need someone who 's going to believe me . Do you believe me ? Well , do you ? Well , I want to . I - I do . I ... Well , that 's a start . Well , wait a second . I 'll walk you home . All right . * * Victor ? Victor ? It 's me , Fishman . Geez . Why don 't you turn on some lights around here ? What , are you trying to save money ? Victor ? Oh . Hi . I 'm looking for , uh , Victor Buena Vista . Hey , thanks a lot , pal . Victor ? Victor , I got the money . Ten G 's . Don 't ask me how I got it . Even if I told you , you 'd never believe me . Vic ? Oh . Must be some game , huh ? What , did you put money on it ? Huh ? Vic ... Vic ? Vic . You 're early . It 's not the cat ! It 's me ! Open up ! How you doing ? Oh , man , I 'm in trouble . What 's her name ? Very funny . I spend the night out in the street , and you give me stand-up . I saw a guy get murdered last night . What ? Not only that the guy who did it saw me . Don 't get it ! It might be him ! Oh , the cat . So , uh , what happened ? Well , remember that guy I told you about ? I went to go see him yesterday . Yeah , the ... You took that money ? You let an armored car crash on purpose ? No ! I tried to stop it , I swear ! All right , the truth is ... truth is that sometimes I let my subconscious get a little overactive , okay ? It just happened . It , it was like fate . I needed $ 10,000 and $ 10,000 just happened to appear in my hands . They were gonna incinerate the bills anyway . Fate ? Are we gonna sit here and argue about some petty larceny crime , or ... are we gonna deal with the fact that my life is in danger ? It was ... horrible . All right , all right , you-you say that this-this guy , whoever he is , you say he saw you ? Yeah , nose-to-nose , chin-to-chin . I 'm toast . It 's here . It is ? What does it say ? Read it to me . " The body of a local businessman " was pulled from the water " near the docks late yesterday afternoon . " The deceased was identified as Victor Buena Vista , " an import-export trader known to have syndicate ties . Police are calling the death a mob-style execution . " The mob ? Boy , you , you sure know how to , how to pick a business partner . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . He wasn 't killed at the docks . He was killed in his office . I saw him . Unless they ... came back and moved the body . Which means they could be watching me . Oh , my God . Wait . Now , just take it easy , would ya ? Oh , my God . Gary ... I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm not toast . I 'm bacon . The mob , huh ? What kind of business was this guy in ? Computer chips from China . Drugs . No , it 's legit . I even saw the merchandise . I bought a laptop from the guy . You know , these guys always got legitimate covers . And they 're always looking for patsies , too . So , how come , how come this wasn 't on the news ? Never mind . I don 't want to know . Okay , so now what ? You go downtown . Uh-uh . No way . Uh-uh . Wait . Look , you gotta go downtown . You witness a crime , it 's the law . Correction . It 's my life , okay ? I know what happens when these guys get your number . I am staying right here . All right . Where are you going ? I 'm going down to the library to get some research for Marissa . Oh , so you 're leaving me now , huh ? Well , yeah . She needs me . I 'm gonna ... I need you ! Hey , I 'll take him down , Hobson . Thank you very much . And listen , would you listen to the man , please ? Please . I 'll be back in an hour . I 'm doomed . I had such a promising future . Wait a minute . There 's always witness protection . You 're better off buying yourself a fake mustache . You think I blend in ? Yeah , if it was Halloween . You 're making me nuts here ! At the rate we 're going , we 're not even gonna get to my car until sometime tomorrow afternoon . I can 't do this . I can 't tell on ' em . I 'll be a marked man . From what you said , you 're already a marked man . At least this way , the cops 'll be able to identify the body . Oh ... Why is this happening to me ? It 's your karma . Bad things got a way of catching up with you . You reap what you sow . You believe that ? In your case , absolutely . Hey , what are you doing ? ! But I mean , you can change your karma , right ? I mean , by doing a good deed , you can make a difference ? I forgot the rulebook . Wait here . Watch out , lady ! Don 't worry , lady . Hold it ! Hold it ! Hey , buddy ! After you . Moron ! Wait a minute . Slow down ! What are you doing ? ! Slow down . Relax . You 're very kind . Don 't mention it . Just doing my bit . You got that ? ! What 's your name ? Fishman . Chuck Fishman . F - i-s-h-m-a-n ! Fishman ! Okay ? Fishman . Right . You 're certifiable , you know that ? Hide me ! What ? That guy , look at him . He 's a hit man . Fishman , are you coming down to the police station or not ? Not ! All right . This is , it 's all I could find . So now what-what do we look for ? Case histories . Any record of people blind from birth regaining sight . Listen , have you ever heard of this happening before ? Yeah , in the Bible . I didn 't bring that . Hmm . Look , if it happened at all , I want to know . I mean , if there 's any way that I can convince my doctor that it 's possible , then maybe he 'll believe my story . Maybe there are more tests we can do . What ? Well , it 's just I ... Look , I don 't want you to get your hopes up about something ... Stop . I can pretty much guess what my doctor said to you , and I can tell you right now that he 's wrong about me . Sure , it would be nice to see . I used to dream about it all the time when I was a little girl , but I like my life . And I saw something . And I want to know why . Why me ? Would you get a hold of yourself ? Sure , that 's easy for you to say . You 're not the one who 's being hunted down . You know , you can 't go on like this . You 're gonna have to get help . You realize that ? Help ? That 's a joke . The cops can 't help me . No one can . Don 't open that ! Gary ? Yeah ? Gary ? Sorry . Chuck 's being a little bit paranoid right now . Oh . Better safe than , uh , whatever . Oh . And how are you doing , Chuck ? Oh , I 'm terrified . And how are you , Marissa ? Well , I checked the Internet . There was no help there . Um , seems that there are no other recorded cases of vision recurrence like mine . And I guess I just wished it all . Are , are , are you sure ? I mean , you , you were sure that you , uh ... I 'm not too sure about anything right now . Yeah , well , that makes two of us . How could I be so stupid ? ! That 's what I was wondering . Gary ... No , he 's right . I put my money on the wrong horse , and it wasn 't even my money ! Well , what do you mean , it wasn 't your money ? He 's talking about the armored car accident . You took money from that ? It was only ten G 's . $ 10,000 ? ! That 's robbery , Chuck ! I lost it at the murder scene . Does that make up for any of it ? No . I didn 't think so . Crumb says you reap what you sow . If that 's the case , I 'd hate to be me at harvest time . It 's a little late for remorse , don 't you think ? I really did it this time . Here , take this . What 's this ? It 's a St. Jude 's medal . My grandmother gave it to me . St. Jude ? Patron saint of hopeless cases . Give it a try . You never know . Hopeless cases . That 'll fit . Hey , where you going ? I 'm gonna take a drive . It 's harder to catch a moving target . Keep that couch warm for me , huh ? Hey . Hey ! Chuck . His name 's Chuck Fishman , and he 's been kidnapped ? Look , I told you this already . His car door was wide open . He hasn 't been seen since last night . Any ransom note ? No , it 's not that kind of kidnapping . What kind of kidnapping is it ? It 's the kind of kidnapping where you 're , you 're found floating in the river after three days . That kind of kidnapping . What have you done to my office ? It 's not your office anymore . And it 's called " taste . " If you could file a missing persons report ... Not till tomorrow . Don 't touch that ! Well , tomorrow 's gonna be a little too late ! What makes you so sure your friend 's in trouble ? Maybe he 's just hanging out somewhere . Wouldn 't be the first time . I know how you guys are . He witnessed a murder Tuesday night of Victor Buena Vista . I see . That 's " I see " as in , " I see a way to clear up a front-page case and get myself a promotion . " Your friend witnessed Victor Buena Vista 's murder ? Yeah . Well , no , not exactly . He ... Well , he saw the body , and it was after the murder . At the docks ? No , at Buena Vista Imports . I see . That 's ... " I see " as in , " This conversation is wasting my time . " Forensics has been all over Buena Vista Imports . Clean as a whistle . Sorry , Crumb , but I 'm seeing nothing here to tie your missing bar boy into the case . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Thanks for nothing . Come on , let 's go . They 're not gonna look for him , are they ? What can they do anyway ? Check out every Dumpster in the city of Chicago ? Look , let 's face it , if the mob 's got him , it 's gonna be hard to find him anyway . At least in one piece . Maybe he lost his nerve , and he took off for the hills . Oh , without telling us ? Well , why don 't you just look in that crystal ball of yours or whatever it is that you do ? Oh , thanks a lot . All right , look , I 'm gonna go back and rattle a few more cages . I might be a has-been , but I still know a trick or two . Thanks . Hey , I like the little guy , too , you know ? Well , " like " is a little strong a word . Just-just try to find him , would you , please ? I 'll try to find him . Help ! Help ! Finally . Thought you forgot all about me . Listen , I need to see the man in charge . I 'm willing to make a deal . I won 't say another word about anything that I saw - or-or didn 't see , actually , 'cause I didn 't see anything , but - Listen , if you let me go , I 'll forget all about this kidnapping business . Another five minutes , and the offer is withdrawn ! Come on , man ! Come on , just give me a clue . I 'll take it from there . 'Scuse me . I 'm not gonna do that again . * * Marissa , I found it . Found what ? The drawing that you made down-downtown at Franklin and Randolph - I found it . I mean , it 's just a sketch of what you drew ... Gary , please don 't do this . I know you want to help , but , uh , this isn 't the way . No , no , I found it . I 've got it . Gary , look , I don 't know what you 're doing , but I know how it feels . So let 's just forget it . What are you talking about ? Well , in the first place , I wasn 't at Randolph and Franklin that morning . I was down by the lake . I went there again today . I sat on the same bench , and I asked someone to tell me what he could see . There was nothing but water ! What did you find ? I looked through the file on Buena Vista . The guy 's got a record as long as Aunt Tillie 's nose . He dealt with every family in the city . So I talked to my people , and we figure it 's got to be the Rosarios . Oh , good . Then we go see them . Are you kidding ? Rosarios are big business now . They 'll never cop to a murder . They 've even got their own trademark . You know that thing with the back-to-back R 's ? If we 're gonna find Fishman , we have to find him on our own . What kind of business did you say they were in ? Well , shipping , mostly . But , uh , they ... Marissa , you were wrong . Oh , Gary , don 't do this . Listen to me . I need you to tell me everything that you saw . I already did . No , I want you to tell me everything exactly . Please . I was out . I was facing out , toward the water . And suddenly everything was different . Um ... I could hardly bear it , it was so , uh , guess you would say bright . And then everything changed , and it got very dark . Very dark . And I don 't know what it was , but it was that shape . And it was , it was moving , like , um , floating . And that 's it . That 's everything . Do we have to do this ? Was there anything else ? No . Except for a sound . A whistle , a horn . A ship 's horn ? That could have been it . Could have been what ? She saw a boat . A tugboat . A tugboat makes that sound . So ? The docks . That 's where they found Buena Vista , the docks . That 's where he is , isn 't he ? I knew there was a reason . Oh , not this mumbo-jumbo again . Now you think Fishman 's on a boat ? I 'll call the police . No , no , don 't do that . They-they won 't help . We 're gonna do it . On some heebie-jeebie hunch ? It 's not a hunch , Crumb . It 's something more than that . It ... Stop . I don 't want to know . Marissa , you keep things running here . We 'll call you if we need help . Come on , Crumb , let 's go . Ask me , we already need help . Okay , we found it . Now what ? Now we get Chuck . Well , wait a minute , wait a minute . This-this is not like snatching some little old biddy out of traffic . These people are serious . What we got to do is , we got to hang around here till some of those guys leave . Believe me , if Fishman 's still alive , this will give us our best shot . Come on , Crumb , we can 't wait much longer . We shouldn 't have to ; there 's only one guy left . Well , then let 's go . You remember the plan ? Yeah , I remember the p ... Hey , this is gonna work , huh ? Maybe . Well , that 's very reassuring . Come on , let 's go . Excuse me . The , uh , Captain here ? Captain 's not here . We 're with the Port Authority Commission . Harbor safety . We got a report that your boat here , it 's not up to code . What code ? 2706 - faulty wiring . Could be a fire hazard . That 's bull . Hey , you got a problem with that , why don 't you call the Rosarios ? Interrupt their dinner . They love that sort of thing . Look-look , all we need to do is we need to get into the wheelhouse . It 'll only take a second , then we 're out of your hair . All right , come on board . Told you it 'd work . All right , this doesn 't look too bad . This shouldn 't take long to check out . Hey , where 's the other guy ? Don 't worry about him . Just let me do my job . You can 't be too careful with these old tugs . I tell you , I still don 't like this wiring up here , though . When was the last time this was checked out ? It looks corroded . It 's just a hobby . Gary ? Oh , uh , no , that-that 's right . This is McGinty 's . We 're open till 1 : 00 . Gary . Chuck ! Gare ! Where have you been ? How you doing ? I - I 'll be fine once you get this thing off of me . Don 't bother . Probably just have to put them right back on again . How come he didn 't get cuffs ? Oh , I guess they weren 't expecting a crowd . When does the backup arrive ? What backup ? What back - You didn 't call backup ? What kind of cop are you ? A retired cop . Cut it out , will you ? Well , who knows we 're here ? You didn 't tell anyone ? Yes , I did . Who ? Marissa . Come on , Gary , call . Please call . No one 's gonna find us here . Shut up , Fishman . Well , at least this thing ain 't going anywhere . You had to say that , didn 't you ? ! You just had to say it ! Think you could knock that off ? I can 't help it . This thing is killing me . Ow ! Now I 'm gonna need skin grafts ! Where we 're going , you 're not gonna need anything . Listen , will you two quit it so we can get out of here ? I 'm game . How ? Yeah . I don 't know . Gary ? Gary , are you here ? 911 emergency . Hello , police ? I 'd like to report a ... 911 , emergency . Hello ? I 'll call back . Cat ? What are you doing here ? Oh , God . God . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me , I need someone to help me , please . Could someone help me , please ? There may not be much time ! Please ! Anyone . This is all my fault . You can say that again . If I ever get out of here , I 'm gonna change . I swear , I 'll be good . People will go , " There goes Chuck Fishman , friend of orphans and little old ladies . " Would somebody just shoot me now ? Gary , there 's something I never told you before . You remember when you , you found your Walkman last year all smashed and mangled , and you didn 't know what happened ? That was me . Well , that 's-that 's all right . And that hundred dollar bill you left on your dresser and when you came back , you couldn 't find it ? You took that ? Why ? I 'm a heel . And yet , you remain my friend . Oh , that 's-that 's all right . That 's okay . I guess what I 'm trying to say is , Gare , I love you , man . I really love you . I love you , too . Crumb ? No , don 't start on me , now . You 're really a very special person . Hobson , you better figure a way to get us out of here . 'Cause I 'm going to strangle this guy . I 'm trying , believe me . The two of you are two of the most special people in the world . If we could just find something to pick this lock . I am so lucky . Who am I kidding ? This is hopeless . I feel so grateful to have known both of you . Bu ... Hopeless ? Hopeless . Hopeless cases . Hope ... less . Would this come in handy ? I don 't believe it . This just might work . What is that ? It 's , uh ... Marissa 's St. Jude medal . What does that mean ? We 're out of gas . Hey . You hear anything ? This is just a guess . I don 't think it 's a good sign . Well , there 's nobody here . You mean , we 've just been drifting all this time ? Yeah , looks that way . Well , start this baby up , and let 's get home ! Hey , like I said , no juice . Well , maybe the , uh , the radio . Whoops . Lord , I know we haven 't been speaking for the past few days , and maybe we should have , but I need another miracle . I know it sounds selfish , but I told Gary that I believe there 's a reason for all of this . And I still believe that there is . So , here I am . You let me see once , Father . And I thank You for that . Please let me see again . Please ... Please let me see . How awful . Excuse me ? Sorry . I was just reading this story in your paper about a sunken tugboat . Tugboat ? Can you read it to me , please ? Sure . Are you okay ? I am now . Tell me that isn 't what I think it is . I think there 's something you guys should know right now . I can 't swim . Four minutes and 25 seconds and counting . Listen , Crumb-Crumb , you got to - You got to disarm this . How ? What do you mean , how ? You-you go to the movies , don 't you ? You-you snip the wires . The red one . That 's what they did in Air Force One . Fishman , you see any wires on this thing ? This is digilatized ! This is state of the art . You mess with this , we blow . All right , well , there-there 's got to be a - a life raft , or , uh , something like that . We 've been all over this scow . There 's no life raft , there 's no nothing . Hey ! What about this ? What ? Three of us on one life preserver ? You kidding me ? This thing could hold a tank . All right , so we swim . Have a nice day . All of us . Well , you don 't understand , Hobson . I ... Come on , Crumb . No ... We 'll hold you up . Go on , the both of you 's , get out of here . Start swimming . There 's something you don 't understand : If you don 't go , I don 't go ; if I don 't go , he doesn 't go ; it 's one for all , and all for one . If I go , will you shut up right now ? Yes ! I 'll go . It is a far , far better thing I 've done today than ever I have done before . Can we just go ? ! Yeah , all right , all right . One ... One ... Two ... Two ... Prepare to be boarded . Wait ! Prepare to be boarded . Marissa . Hey ... ! I don 't believe it . It 's Marissa . Here 's that dramatic photo taken earlier today by a crewman on the rescue vessel moments after saving three men from a death trap set by organized crime . Police say today 's series of events have led to arrests all in connection with the murder of Victor Buena Vista . They 're also pursuing other leads linking today 's events to the mob . Yeah ! Hey . You know how it ends . Good guy wins . Yeah . I just wanted to hear my name mentioned one more time . Charles Fishman ? Yeah ? I represent the law firm of Guilder Smith . Earlier this week , you helped an old woman across the street . So ? Well , that woman is a client of ours . That bag lady ? Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays . The rest of the time she 's Mrs. Camilla Danforth . Wait . Camilla Danforth , the , uh , department store heiress ? The same . She 's a bag lady ? Mrs. Danforth likes to walk the city unobserved in search of the needy and deserving . She asked me to give you this . It 's not ticking . If you 'll just sign here . Good day . Yeah . Take care . What is it ? I don 't know , but I 'm sure it 's something good . Well , just open it , Fishman . It 's a Bible . Hmm ... What is that ? It 's a ... It 's a check . Well , for how much ? $ 100,000 ... ? $ 100,000 ? Well , what 's that ... What 's the card say ? " Dear Mr. Fishman , " I 'm sure you 'll use this for a worthy cause . " The world needs more good people like you . Camilla Danforth . " Whoa ! She got the wrong guy there ! Woo-hoo ! No , she didn 't . She 's right . I said I 'm going to change , and I am . What ? I need to think . Is he serious ? You never can tell with him . Well , this is it . This is it . So , you 're really going to do it , huh ? Absolutely . I 'm supposed to put that money to good use , and that 's what I intend to do . In L.A. ? L.A. ' s the place . Fishman Productions . Wholesome family entertainment . You 're joking . No . I even got my first idea . It 's going to be about a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . You 've got to be kidding . No . And he has this friend , this , uh , sidekick , this second banana who , uh , is an incredible pain in the butt . What do you think ? What do I think ? It 'll never float . It 's Hollywood , baby . Good-bye , Marissa . Who am I going to argue with , Chuck ? There 's always the cat . Hmm . Oh ! And , uh , don 't forget this . It came in , uh , incredibly handy . Appreciate the loan . You 're welcome . Oh , you 'll be fine . We 'll ... we 'll-we 'll see each other . I mean , you know , we 'll talk . We-we 've got the phone . Yeah . You got my cell phone number ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , I got your number . You get in trouble , you give me a call . If you need me , I got your back , you know that ? Yeah , yeah . Listen , uh ... about that , uh , second banana thing , you know , you-you were never second banana . I appreciate it . I 'll miss you , buddy . Okay ... Okay ... I 'm leaving now . Bye , Chuck . I 'm going . Bye , McGinty 's . I 'll-I 'll call you when I get there , okay ? I may stop in Vegas first . Arrivederci . Wow . So he 's really gone , huh ? Yeah . I have a feeling , though , he 's never going to be too far away . Hey , how are you , uh , you know , about , uh ... My sight ? Yeah . Well , it 's still the same . You know , I don 't know , Gary , maybe , um ... maybe I did just imagine that tugboat , or-or maybe I really did have a vision , like in the Bible . Hmm ... What ? Nothing . It 's just that , uh ... you had a vision , and ... he got his sight . Maybe . Buy you a cup of coffee ? Sure . Why not ?

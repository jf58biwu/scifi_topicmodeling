 For this wonderful occasion . And so , another principal proudly take this place on our wall of honor . Lades and gentlemen Clive Randolph Scampi ! STUDENT : Go , Scampi ! My dear Farber family I 'm ... moved to see all of you here for the sole purpose of honoring little old me . Where are the guys ? They 're going ot miss the ... Ooh ! Crab puffs ! Every day , you make me late . Every day . Lisa gave us a teleporter to zap us to school and still we 're late . Snooze alarm- - It 's the devil 's tool . [ teleporter whirring ] Hey , Lis . What are you doing here ? Waiting for the reception . And now , the proudest moment in this humble educator 's career . [ ceremonial music playing ] [ crowd gasping ] [ crowd laughing ] GARY : Hey , everybody , look . It 's Principal Trampi . [ laughter continues ] - Clever . - [ nervous chuckle ] - Very clever . - [ laughter continues ] - Hey . - Oh . Hello , Miss , uh ... ? Tomp ... kin ... bur ... gle ... - Thorpowitz . - Geometry , right ? The funniest thing just happened . I was at the vending machine buying a snickers and two of them came out . - You want one ? - You 're very kind but I 've had all the snickers I can bear for one day . Yeah , you 'd think it 'd get easier , wouldn 't you ? I mean , after all , I 've endured the japes and wheezes of students for years . - This happens a lot ? - Oh , yes . From my very first assembly where I was ruthlessly pantsed to those buffoonish impersonations of me at the annual talents shows . Those meanies . In this day and age a principal is no more than a glorified babysitter . I lack the resources and authority to bring these vandels to justice . Suppose you had some more resources- - A little more authority . Do you really think you could make a difference ? I know I could , Miss Tompkinburglethorpowitz . I know I could . [ Scampi grunting ] The building is secured . Evidence labeled and sealed . We found this twinkle wrapper near your vandalized portrait . I want the FBI to run a trace on that twinkle wrapper . Have the CIA bug the boys ' bathroom in case someone starts bragging . Call the PTA and postpone the spelling bee 'cause we got us some bad guys to catch . Okay , okay . Celebrity lips . Who am I ? Don Knotts ? Michael Keaton ! Okay , here 's an easy one . Again , I go with Don Knotts . Julia Roberts . I can 't get any easier than that . - Oh ! - Now , that 's Don Knotts . [ students clamoring ] Mr. Donnelly , Mr. Wallace I place you under arrest for the crime of vandalism . - Under whose authority ? - How about ... the Broad of Education ? I don 't know what Lisa did or why she did it , but I don 't like it . Take them away . Wait a minute ! We didn 't do anything . You can 't just arrest us out of the blue . You still got to have evidence . This was found at the crime scene . Using the UPC bar code we traced the twinkles' point of sale to Ed 's gas and go . And the security cameras caught all the fun . Thus , placing you both at the crime scene . It 's purely circumstantial evidence . It 'll never hold up in court . We should have played the race card . - What race would that be , Gary ? - Uh , the human race ? You 're an idiot . SCAMPI : Welcome , students , to Farber High 's Loco for Locomotion Day . - Hmm ... - [ engine turning over ] - Hmm ... - [ bell clinking ] Oh , my God ! Oh ! Quick ! Quick ! Hurry ! Push us off the tracks ! Push us off the tracks ! We can 't ! We 're handcuffed ! - Toss me the keys ! - [ horn honking ] [ people yelling ] Toss me the keys ! Toss me ... the keys ! [ squealing ] - [ whistling blowing ] - Move ! Look out ! - No ! - [ children screaming ] [ grunting ] Come on , come on ! Hey , you come back here right now ! My , my , my , my , my , what a mess . Tention . Attention everyone . The fugitives have been on the loose since third period . Now , what I want from you is a hard-target search of every arcade , movie house , fun house and waffle house in the area . Your fugitives ' names are Wyatt Donnelly and Gary Wallace . - [ helicopter whirring overhead ] - Go get ' em . Give me one good reason why I shouldn 't call Scampi - and turn you two hoodlums in . - Because we didn 't do it ! - [ siren wailing ] - How can you not believe us ? Hello ! Videotape evidence . - I mean , come on . - All we did was buy a twinkle . Can 't you zap up some video evidence of the actual crime ? Then maybe we can find out who 's really responsible . Oh . Yeah , I guess I could . And how about something to eat ? This whole on-the-lam thing 's making my tummy growl . Let 's do both . What 's that ? Mystic pizza . It 's like a crystal ball . Gaze into it , and it 'll show us who trashed Scampi 's picture . Then we chow down . [ sniffing ] : Sure smells good . Ooh ! I 'm starting to get an image ! - Why 's the picture so crappy ? - Extra cheese . [ mouthing words : ] WYATT : There he is ! The guy 's got only one arm ? Icky . I guess you guys didn 't do it . Oh , look who just caught up . Now let 's see if your little pizza will get us a good look at this guy 's face . What ? I can 't believe you ate his face ! [ glass crashing ] SCAMPI : Give yourselves up , boys . Your extracurricular activities have come to an end . Go for it ! I 'll stay here and stall the fuzz . [ siren wailing ] Okay . Scampi 's personal files . This looks promising . For academic records , double-click the Book icon . For attendance records , the Calendar icon . For a detailed listing of students with bizarre physical deformities double-click the Hunchback icon . [ double-clicks ] There 's no one-armed man listed in here . Hey , look ! Ed Ferrera 's got six toes . - How does that help ? - I don 't know . It 's just fascinating . [ grunting in frustration ] Chett ? Okay . Where 's my arm ? We might ask you the same thing . We 've been looking for a one-armed man who trashed Scampi 's picture and left us holding the bag . Did you take the fall for that ? I 'm even more of a genius than I thought . If you 're such a genius , how come you only have one arm ? Well , I discovered your teleporter and I decided that was the perfect way to sneak into Farber and to get some payback on Scampi . Hmm , twinkie . My beer . Hey ! When it return , it was gone so I figured you two tub-bubblers took it . Why would we want your disembodied arm ? It didn 't just crawl away . So , because of Lisa 's magic , Chett lost an arm and we 're Farber 's most-wanted . There 's got to be some kind of record . [ can falls ] - What the hell is that ? - BOTH : Scampi . - [ grunts ] - WYATT : Wait for us ! Later . It 's locked . SCAMPI : Well ... like a dog returns ot his vomit so return miscreants to the scene of their transgression . Great . Now we 're getting blamed for something some dog did . It 's all over but the crying , boys . - But we 're innocent . - I don 't care . But we were set up . It 's the one-armed man you want . Oh , that explain everything . Believe us . Chett is the one-armed man . I happen to know that your brother is a two-fisted drinker- - An activity which requires a minimum of two fists . Chett lost his arm when he tried teleporting to school . He picked up a twinkie , and his arm fell off before he trashed your picture . We saw it in the mystic pizza before I bit his head off . Mocking me to the better end , huh ? All I want from you boys is a little respect . But , uh ... we do respect you , sir . In fact , you are the man who taught us respect . Go ahead , Donnelly . Pull the fire alarm . Commit another crime . - Hmm . - Hmm . Show us how you not only disrespect me - but how you disrespect yours ... - [ alarm ringing ] Oh , hell . SCAMPI : After them ! But ... no running during a fire drill . Single file , orderly fashion . [ siren blaring ] [ man 's voice ] : Freeze , dirt bags ! - Funny genie . - Funny , funny genie . This will sound strange but there is a disembodied arm - crawling around your bedroom . - It 's Chett 's . - So Chett is the one-armed man ? - And he won 't confess . If we find his arm , we can hold it hostage and force him to tell the truth . I still don 't know that was wrong with my idea . Come here , little arm . Give me a kiss . This plan can 't miss . [ playing " Heart and Soul " ] [ stops playing ] [ resumes playing ] [ playing melody ] Get him ! Get him ! [ shouts ] Nail clippings . Bastards . SCAMPI : Donnelly 's got a clean record . Never missed a day . And Wallace ? Too witless to pull off a crime this clever . Things just don 't add up . And what about the brother and this crazy one-armed man theory ? - Chett Donnelly . - He certainly is a criminal type . But he 's got two arms . What if he didn 't ? [ phone ringing ] Yeah , this is Scampi . WYATT : Remember what we told you by the fire alarm ? [ snapping fingers ] I remember you endangering the public safety . ( whispering ) : Keep him talking . You know , Mr. Donnelly running during a fire drill is a hazard . We 're in the library . [ click , then dial tone ] Did you get it ? - Mm-mmm . - No , not enough time . Damn ! Well , if there 's no more call-tracing to be done I have to mop the library . The library ! Turn yourself in to Scampi or we hurt the arm . Indian burn . Start singing or the arm starts singing . [ snorts ] Do your worst . [ groaning ] WYATT : Crack his knuckles . I ... ain 't ... talking . Charley horse ! Man down ! Man down ! Leave me ! Finish this thing . I got an itch that needs scratching . You don 't have the guts to scratch that itch . No ! Okay . Okay , I 'll confess . Good , because Scampi should be here any second . Ow ! Nipple ! Nipple ... That-a-boy . Well ... Looks like we got all the characters in our little drama . Though I didn 't expect to see you , Miss Tompkinburglethorpowitz . Any point in us still trying to convince you we 're innocent ? You know , I was all set to believe you boys ... But now , I find myself face-to-face with the disappointing reality that your brother indeed does have two arms . That 's right . Two arms . Count them and weep . They clap ... they flap ... they do the disco dance of innocence . You 've got to be freaking kidding me . There really is a one-armed man . So what ? The arm fell off . It doesn 't prove nothing . It proves you 're a liar and that makes you the number-one suspect . - That 's good enough for me . - And me . - And me . - Me , too . - Book him , Renfro . - Hey , I 'm out of here . I 'm asking you not to run , Chester Donnelly . Show me some respect just this once . You got to earn my respect . I 'll handle this . [ laughing ] Is it safe to assume that I 've now earned your respect ? I got to admit , that was pretty cool . [ laughs ] Uh , we 're missing part of the suspect , sir . Attention , people . Our fugitive has been on the crawl for ten minutes . It 's approximately 27 inches long possessing four digits and an opposable thumbs . Average hand speed- - over a waxed floor , barring injury- - Is 100 yards an hour . Our assailant has been known to clasp the male nipple and twist vigorously . Flak jackets are mandatory . So are knees pads , elbow pads , shin pads , foot pads ... Captioned by Grant Brown

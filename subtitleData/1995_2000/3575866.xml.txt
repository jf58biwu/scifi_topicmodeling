 ( kids laughing , screaming ) WOMAN : Okay , you go back . Oh , look . Mr. Boggles is out of his cage . Miss Bailey ! Miss Bailey ! Mr. Boggles is out of his cage ! I 'll be right there , Allie . Good job . Miss Bailey ! Miss Bailey ! Mr. Boggles is running away ! Not so far . Come back here , Mr. Boggles . Come back ! CHUCK : Paper said 9 : 00 a.m. , right ? GARY : Around 9 : 00 a.m. CHUCK : Around ? That 's not very helpful . Least they could do is give you the exact time . Yeah , well- - Who 's they ? They . You know , whoever delivers the paper in the first place . Well , they don 't know the exact time ... Hang on ! ( tires screeching , car horns blaring ) Next time you do that , tell me about it beforehand ! I said , " hang on , " didn 't I ? ! Besides , you 're the one that 's in such a big hurry . Oh , no . CHUCK : What ? Look , " Pedestrian killed on Chestnut . " Chestnut ? We 're on Chestnut . Right . How ? Speeding car . When ? Now ! ( tires screeching ) Oh , mama ! ( people talking , car horns honking ) Are you okay ? I-I think so . What are you doing ? I 'm-I 'm laying in the street . What happened ? Well , you fainted . Uh , uh ... You fainted , Walter . How 'd you know my name ? Well , becau- - He 's all right . You take care of him . Hey , why me ? 'Cause I got to go . You can 't do that ; that 's a hit and run . ( engine starts ) Well , except that we didn 't hit him . What are you doing ? I-I think my nose is gonna bleed . * * Excuse me . Who are you ? I 'm looking for Allie Chapman . Do you know where she is ? I 'm sorry , but unless you 're a qualified guardian , I ... Look , this is an emergency . She 's gonna disappear , if she hasn 't already . Now , where is she ? I 'm sorry , but I 'm gonna have to ask you to leave . Look , do-do you know where Allie is , Allie ... ? Allie ? Well , hey , wait . Allie ? ! Allie ! Sir , I insist you ... Allie ! Allie ? Oh , my God . Allie ! Allie ! GARY : Allie ! ALLIE : Mr. Boggles , where are you ? Mr. Boggles , where are you ? Mr. Boggles , where are you ? ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * It 's not your fault . Okay , let 's go over this again . You 're who ? Teacher ? Parent ? Look , I already told you this . Just happened by . That 's right . Why ? Well , no particular reason . But you asked about Allie Chapman . Said you thought she was missing . And why is that ? Look , I guessed , all right ? Well ... you guessed right . Detective Barnes ? We 've searched the area ; there 's no sign of her anywhere . Hospitals ? Nothing yet , sir . Okay , start a house-to-house . Yes , sir . I 'm Mrs. Chapman . Is there any ... Not yet , ma 'am . Karen . I 'm so sorry . I got to do this . Um , I can reach you at this address , right ? Yeah . You wouldn 't happen to know where this little girl is , would you ? No , sir . Never hurts to ask , right ? ( siren wailing in distance ) Uh , Ms. Chapman , um ... ( clears throat ) need to ask you a couple questions about your daughter . Stop beating yourself up . You did what you could . I missed her . You tried . Yeah , I tried and I missed her . She 's a five-year-old kid . Well , she 'll turn up . The paper just says she 's not found , that 's all . No where , no when , no how , nothing . Did you tell the police what you know ? I don 't know anything . What could I tell them ? Why does this do this to me ? Well , there 's a reason . What reason ? I have no idea . Well , thank you very much . You 're welcome . I would 've got to her if some nut hadn 't run out in front of Chuck 's car- - The nut . What ? I left Chuck with the nut . ( door opens ) CHUCK : Hey , Gare . Remember your buddy Chuck ? Of course , you 've met Walter . Nice running into you again . CHUCK : Oh , no . Uh-uh . That would be a disaster . Well , he looks okay . All right . Yeah , I 'll get his signature anyway . Thanks , Mort . Who was that ? That was my lawyer . I need to get a release signed for the accident . What accident ? We didn 't hit the guy . Correct . But if some smart lawyer gets ahold of his story , we are in a lot of trouble . Well , he doesn 't seem like the kind of guy that would sue you . And how , may I ask , would you know that ? Well , it 's just a feeling . I mean , he seems sad . I feel sorry for him . Hey , Walt , are you , uh , are you sure you 're not hurt ? I 'm fine , thanks . Thanks for asking . Yeah , no problem . So what do you got in this briefcase you 've been lugging around ? Oh , nothing . Just my life 's work . You mind if I , uh ... Well , go ahead . ( latches clicking ) Whoa . What the heck is it ? It 's called a digital aurameter . It filters out the big noises and detects micro vibrations . ( turns on aurameter ) Micro what ? Little noises . You know , tiny movements that the ear couldn 't otherwise detect . CHUCK : Oh , really ? Tiny movements , huh ? Mm-hmm . Micro vibrations . ( chuckles ) Wait , what 's so odd about that ? Oh , nothing . This thing 's ridiculous . It 'll never work . Go ahead , Chuck , give it a try . CHUCK : Yeah , sure . ( aurameter powers up ) ( electronic pulsing ) ( cat meows ) ( cat meows ) ( electronic pulsing ) ( heartbeat ) ( heartbeat stops ) ( meows ) Hey , cat . Uh , excuse me for ... Well , I 'll be darned . This thing really works . Of course it works . Now that it 's too late . ( cat meows ) Cat ? Cat ? ( cat meows ) ( meows ) Cat ? ANNOUNCER ( over TV ) : In weather news today , batten down the hatches , Chicago . A severe line of thundershowers is headed our way . The storm line has been approaching , and it 's bringing record amounts of rain along its path as it 's headed into the metropolitan area . Who turned that on ? ( meows ) And now , a special bulletin from the news watchers news room . A five-year-old child is missing . Hello ? Hello ? And so far , police are baffled as to how she may have disappeared from her schoolyard earlier this morning . She was last seen wearing a pink snow suit , and police need your help to find little Allie Chapman . I hope she 's found before the big storm . It 's supposed to be torrential . In other news , the price of milk is going down . ( turns off TV ) What am I supposed to do ? ( growls softly ) There are no new changes in this . ( growls ) ( sighs sharply ) Hey , you know what ? You 're so smart , why don 't you clean the place up , huh ? ( meows ) Just a few hours ago , I was standing at ground zero of every inventor 's dream . There I was , in the boardroom at Consolidated Electric Enterprises . 14 years of blood and sweat and dreams and hard work came down to this one moment . And the machine would not turn on . A crummy two-dollar on / off switch ruined my life . Since then , I 've just been wandering around in a fog . Uh , next thing I remember , I was sitting in the middle of the street , and you were standing over me . Oh . Now that 's a bad day . Mommy ? ( water dripping ) Man , I think Cheryl is so hot . ( chuckles ) So , what are you gonna do about it ? Man , what can I do ? I got no car . ( conversation approaches ) Hello ? Hello ? Oh , wait . Hello ? Help me . What was that ? Somebody help me . Somebody please help me . Somebody please . ( train rumbling ) Did you hear that ? What ? I don 't know . I thought I heard something . It 's nothing , man . Come on . We 're gonna be late . Come on . Let 's go . ALLIE : Hello ? Hello ? Anybody , please ! I 'm down here ! Oh , well , there must be someplace else you can take it to . Uh-uh . I have been totally discredited . In the micro-movement world , I 'm a walking joke . Can it find groundhogs ? Huh ? You know , little animals that burrow under the ground . Oh , that 'd be easy , but that 's not what it 's designed to do . Why ? Well , I 'm in the pest control business . Grant 's the name . Just got back from the police captain 's house . Big groundhog problem . They 're eating his grapevines all over the place . But I couldn 't find the little buggers . A thing like that , if it worked , hell , it 'd be worth a small fortune . But that 's not its scientific purpose . It 's a geological ... Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Is it patented ? Well , of course . Really ? Grant , name 's Charles Fishman . ( siren wails in distance ) All right , now that I 'm here , what the hell am I looking for ? * * * * ( siren wails in distance ) Allie ? Well , well , well , this is gonna be interesting . What are the odds ? How 's that ? You and me . First we meet this morning , then we both show up here . Gotta be astronomical , don 't you think ? Look , if you 're interested in ... Oh , that I am . I 'm looking for Allie Chapman . Thought she might be here ? I thought she could be . Why ? Well , maybe I should ask you the same thing . I 'm a cop . This is my case . I do this for a living . Your turn . I 'm just a nice guy who cares . Oh , you do this kinda like for a hobby , huh ? You just run around looking for lost little girls ? Listen , why don 't you try and help me to understand ? Contrary to popular belief , we cops aren 't as dumb as we look . All right , listen , you want to find Allie Chapman , I think I might know what happened to her . There 's a rabbit missing over at the school , a Mr. , Mr. Boggles or something . Now , I was just over there , only the rabbit 's not there . He 's gone . Now , I think Allie might be looking for this Mr. Boggles , and when she went to look for him , she got lost . And followed him down a hole ? Like Alice in Wonderland ? Allie and Mr. Boggles , huh ? Hey , where 's the Mad Hatter ? I 'm sure I don 't know . You know , I have a theory about this , too . You want to hear it ? Sure . Go ahead . Little girls just don 't disappear . I think someone took her . Maybe someone that lives in there . Now what do you think Mr. Boggles would say about that ? Well , I don 't know . Rabbits , I don 't talk to . Are you done with me now ? You need a lift ? No , thank you . I 'll walk . Yeah , that 's right . Mm-hmm . I 'm not so sure about this . Uh , Captain , no . Look , I understand completely . Those pesky little rodents can drive you nuts . Look , tell the captain that ... Shh ! What ? Oh , no . This machine was built for that problem . Mm-hmm . Oh , the name ? It 's ... Digital Aurameter . Captain , we call it " The Critter Transmitter . " What ? What ? ! Mm-hmm . Okay . So then we 'll see you tomorrow ? Great . Bye-bye . All right , we 're in . How could you do that ? Do what ? Look , this is not some pest control gizmo . It 's a scientific invention for seismic exploration . For natural resource recovery . See , for geographical ... Uh-uh , uh-uh . Walter , Walter , Walter , look at it this way , okay ? Now , this morning , your baby was living on the trash pile , okay ? Well , yeah ... Now thanks to me , you actually have a chance to redeem your reputation . What , by , by catching rodents ? Walter , do you have any idea what you 've built here ? Yes , a locating device . Wrong . It 's a much better mousetrap . Now , you 'll stay at my place tonight with this . Okay . And listen to me . It doesn 't matter what you originally built this for . Well , the sonar ... Nobody cares . Trust me , okay ? Now ... Nothing . Not even a single word has changed in here . Well , why should it be ? Because I talked to the detective at the school about Mr. Boggles . Mr. Boggles ? Mr. Boggles is the missing rabbit . And he didn 't believe you ? It 's very odd there are no changes . Usually there 's something , it gives me an idea what to do , but there 's nothing . Well , maybe you just have to wait for tomorrow 's paper . Yeah ... yeah . I 'll see ya . Wait . Where are you going ? I 'm gonna take a jog . Hey , you know , it 's very strange , but all day I 've been , uh ... I 've been , uh ... Getting this feeling like she 's somewhere nearby ? How did you know that ? It 's a normal response when people are missing . Oh . I guess that makes sense . Yes ? Marissa , what if something happens to that little girl before I get the paper tomorrow ? Guess we have to hope it doesn 't . Yeah . My mommy knows we 're lost , and she will have the police come and find us . MAN : I 'll get it . Hey , what 's going on ? It 's the Chapman place . You know , the kid who got snatched . Snatched ? Kidnapped . What makes them think that ? Sorry . Sources . Oh , yeah ? Well , you 're wasting your time . You ought to go home . Says who ? Sorry . Sources . You know , my sources say that the cops already have a suspect in mind . Oh , yeah ? Whoever it is , I would hate to be that guy . ( thunder crashes ) ( indistinct radio transmission ) Do you want a cookie ? It 's your favorite ; a elephant . ( squeaking ) ( squeaking ) ( screaming ) ( quietly ) : Maybe tomorrow . WOMAN ( over radio ) : ... metropolitan area . And for anyone who hasn 't heard yet , the weatherman says we 're going to get some heavy rain , starting about midday . There 's a small craft advisory , ( cat meows ) so stay off the lakes ... " The body of Allie Chapman was discovered yesterday " in a drainage pipe at Main Street wash . " A city search has been underway for the little girl " who wandered off the morning before . " Apparently , the girl drowned " when the pipes from the maze of tunnels beneath the city " filled with runoff from yesterday 's heavy rains . " The discovery came as a surprise to police , " who were certain Miss Chapman had been abducted . Funeral services will be held Friday . " That 's it ? That 's the thing that 's gonna find the groundhogs ? This , sir , is absolutely guaranteed . How ? Uh , it detects micro-movements in the mini-decibel level ... Smell . It can smell the fur . It can ? Uh , yeah . Good idea . M.I.T. How much is this gonna cost me ? For you , absolutely free- - if you are willing to sign the following endorsement . You save my garden , and I 'll sign your Aunt Mary 's diapers . Okay , let 's give it a try . Good . Come on . Excuse me ? It can smell their fur ? Why get technical ? Simple is better . And for the record , I went to Ohio State . Just leave the public relations to me , okay ? And it 's not a mousetrap ! Well , that 's good , ' cause we 're not looking for mice , we 're looking for groundhogs ! ( thunder rumbling ) ( echoes ) : Allie ? Allie ? Allie ? Straight . ( low electronic humming ) Watch out for my grape arbor . Those plants are very delicate . I didn 't know you could grow grapes out here . Yeah , they 're specially imported from France . They 're dormant now ; come to life in the summertime . Beautiful plants , beautiful . Damn groundhogs have been eating ' em . Taking care of that problem for you right now , Captain . Excuse me . ( whispers ) : Hey , what 's wrong with that thing ? Does it need a new battery ? For your information , it has a 50-year lithium battery . Well , we don 't have 50 years , so set the doohickey on groundhog , and let 's get going . Well ... frankly , this is an exercise in futility . This thing was not designed to find groundhogs . It found a cat , it can find a rodent . I-I-I don 't even know what a groundhog looks like . Hey . We 're almost there , sir . You know what I think ? I think you guys got no idea what you 're doing . N-Now , hold on , with all due respect , I really believe that ... I found something ! He found something . Really ? GARY : Allie ? Where are you ? Allie ? Hey ... Hello , Mr. Boggles . Mr. Boggles . All right . Come on , buddy , we 're gonna go get some help . Mr. Hobson . Barnes , it 's nice to see you , for once . Here . One Mr. Boggles . And here 's one teddy bear . That proves she 's down in there somewhere . Yeah , nice detective work . Hey , look , these tunnels , they run for miles down here . She could be anywhere in there , so I suggest you organize a search party a little bit bigger than this one , huh ? We could . Then again , maybe you could save us some time . ( panting ) : Huh ? Tell us where she is , Hobson . Oh , no . Oh , no , now , listen ... Why don 't you take us to her , man ? You could spare us all a little trouble here . I 'm telling you , I don 't know where she is ! She could be down here anywhere ! Put him in the car . Look , Barnes ... Bar-Barnes , don 't do this . Put him in the car . The kid 's down there somewhere . I don 't know where she ... Hey , my paper ! Barnes , you 're making a big mista ... ( mechanical clanking , rumbling ) Those critters sure dig deep . Are you sure they 're down there ? Might be . Might ? Might be something else . Like what , gophers ? ( sniffs ) Gas . Oh ... Go ... ! Look out ! ( dog barking in distance ) Oh ... Oh , my ... my grapes ! Well , that ought to take care of those groundhogs . If you didn 't put the girl in there , why did you go back for her things ? Look , I didn 't go back . I 've never even been there before . I found the bear down there , and then I found ... The little bunny . Come on . Look , you 've got to believe me , the kid , she went down there by herself , all right ? Okay . So now it 's Alice Through the Looking Glass again . Come on , man , don 't try to play me for a fool . Listen , even if you think it 's me , the least you can do is start the search . Already did . That girl is nowhere near that wash . Well , then I suggest you start again , 'cause I 'm telling you she 's down there somewhere . Maybe . Or maybe it 's all just a red herring . Maybe she 's nowhere near that wash . Look , you gonna charge me with something ? For the moment , I 'm gonna hold you for questioning . All right , well , I got a right to a phone call , right ? In weather news today , batten down the hatches , Chicago . A severe line of thundershowers is headed our way . I want you to know I 'm very sorry . CHUCK : Skip it . I really thought I had it . Had it ? Walter , we blew up his backyard . Whoa , whoa , whoa . That 's not the fault of the aurameter , okay ? Besides , as I think I mentioned to you before ... It 's not a mouse trap . I know . Exactly . You know , I deserve this . Must have been something I 've done , way back . This is karma . Look , I-I know it 's a setback , but that 's no reason to lose faith in the basic technology . That is so typical . I put my reputation on the line , my good name , and this is what I get ! You 're-you 're taking it too personally . Here , sign this . What is it ? It 's a release form from yesterday 's near accident . Robin , you have a pen , please ? Yeah , sure . You think I would sue you ? You think I 'm a fake . I thought you believed in me . Just sign it . ( pen scribbling ) Thank you . You know , may-maybe if I rewired the machine , and ... Nope . Well , we could go back to square one ... Nope . You 're right . Why waste your breath on Walter Dalrymple ? ( phone rings ) He 's not worth it . ROBIN : Hello ? McGinty 's . It 's Gary . Hey , Gar . What 's up ? You 're where ? Listen , Chuck , I need your help , and I need the paper . Don 't ask so many questions , all right ? The State Street Wash . You got that ? I 'll tell ... Look , I 'll tell you when you get here , all right ? ( thunder rumbling ) ( thunder rumbling ) ALLIE ( calling in distance ) : Mommy ? Mommy ? Mommy , help me . ( whimpering ) ( crying quietly ) WOMAN ( on radio ) : The leading edge of this storm is in , and if you look out your window , you 'll see a light drizzle already falling . It 's expected to get pretty heavy at times . So get out your galoshes , and be careful on those roads . The things I do for this guy . All right , look , you let me out of here , I 'll help you find the girl . Then you can throw me in jail . How does that sound ? So you 're gonna show me where she is , huh ? Anything . Let 's just get out there . Where ? Out there where ? I don 't know where exactly . I told you I don 't ... Look , stop playing games with me . I 'm just trying to stop a girl from drowning , that 's all . Sorry , I 'm not biting . Detective ? This kid has something you might want to hear . I don 't mean to be a pain , or anything , but ... Well , the TV said to come here if I knew something . About what ? That little girl on the news . Well , I meant to get here yesterday , but ... Well , I had school , so ... What about the little girl ? Well , you 're gonna think I 'm crazy . But yesterday , I heard this voice calling from the sewer . I thought I was spacing . Where did you hear the little girl ? Oh , on Ohio , just before State . You ignore this , you 're gonna regret it the rest of your life , I promise you that . You come with me . WOMAN ( on radio ) : Some suburbs are now experiencing significant downpours as the storm moves across the city . A traveler 's advisory is still in effect for all of Cook County . This newspaper 's getting my upholstery all dirty . If you have to go out , please drive carefully . Whoa ! ( brakes squealing ) Not again ! Walter , you 've got to stop doing this . Any news , Captain ? Nothing good . They say the water 's rising pretty fast down there . Well , the rain 's letting up . It 'll go down soon . No way . That water 's coming from all over . It 's not even close to cresting yet . ALLIE ( distant ) : Mommy , help . Mommy ? Somebody ? The water 's getting too high . All right , two things . One , you can 't keep doing this . Two , you are a menace to society . Now I want you to hang that thing up in your garage , and forget about it . I don 't- - I don 't have a garage . Promise me . Then I 'm getting out . No , no , no , no , you 're staying . I 'm leaving . No , you 're staying . I 'm leaving ! Staying ! WOMAN ( on radio ) : Police and rescue departments have instituted a search for a five-year-old girl who they believe is trapped in the storm drain system under the city . That 's Gary 's girl . Rescue teams are concentrating in the area of Ohio and State Streets . Get out . What ? Get out now . I 'm staying . Leaving . Staying . Leaving . Staying . Leave . I 'm staying ! I-I can find that girl . With what ? With that ? Walter , you couldn 't find snow in Antarctica . If you don 't take me , I 'm going to sue you for hitting me with your car . How are you going to sue me ? You signed a release . It 's worthless . I signed it Thomas Alva Edison . Let 's go , buster . How about here ? We 've already been down there . What about this one ? Completely saturated . My men are looking down here right now . Allie ! Hold it , buddy . Where do you think you 're going ? Oh , it 's okay . We got emergency equipment here . This is a groundhog detector . A what ? A groundhog detector . Hey , Gare ! Come on . Hey , Gary ! Hey , we got here as fast as we could . What ... Listen , I think I can help . What are you doing here ? And you ... Gee , what a small world . Who are these guys ? A couple of conmen . Swindlers . Actually , we 're , uh , we 're friends of his . Oh , thank you very much . Don 't mention it . Get them out of my sight . But-But I 've come to help . Let 's go . Hey , wait a minute . Move ! Okay , that 's it . We covered all the tunnels from Rush Street east . GARY : Wait a second . Look , we know she 's down here . You 're not giving up . Look , at this point , I think we need to consider our options . What do you mean , consider your options ? You mean you 're giving up ? It 's getting too dangerous down there . I got my men to think of . Now look what you did . You got us sitting here . Oh , what am I yelling at you for ? It 's not your fault . It 's not ? No . It 's mine . Let 's face it , I 'm a sucker for hopeless causes . Talk about buying the Brooklyn Bridge . Micro-vibrations ? What was I thinking ? ( beeping ) What is that ? Maybe you hurt its feelings . " Hurt its feelings ... " Look , with all due respect , would you just turn that thing off , please ? Shh . What ? What is it ? Be quiet . Oh , the gas company 's gonna have a field day with this one . ALLIE : Mommy ? Mommy ? Oh , this is ridiculous . ( beeping ) She 's under here . I found her . Get somebody . Get someone over here . Oh , no , no . I hereby relinquish all rights and responsibility for that-that-that thing . Hey . Come back here ! Listen to me . You can 't just leave that kid down there . Look , I 'm going to tell you one more time , I am not going to risk my men 's lives on a one in a million . All right , then you give me the equipment and I 'll do down there . You want to go down there ? You 're crazy . WALTER : I found her ! I found her with the aurameter . She 's ... here . Can 't be . That tunnel 's full of water . I don 't care . She 's alive , I 'm sure of it . Oh , no . Get him out of here . And I mean out of here now . Wait . Let 's hear him out , just in case . Listen , I may look like a crackpot , and I know things haven 't always gone right , but this one time , I need you to believe me . She 's down there . Never mind how I know , I just- - I just do . That 's it , I 'm calling this now . It 's too dangerous . Everybody back to the trucks . I 'm sorry . Show me . Come on , show me . Hobson , where are you going ? GARY : I 'm going to find that little girl . CHUCK : Oh , no . Here comes the rain again . Where is she ? She 's under here . Where does this go ? I don 't know . Down to the river , I guess . You 're not going down there . There 's a five-year-old kid down there . Are you going to help me , or not ? ( grunting ) This is Barnes . Get a rescue team down to the State Street wash , now . MAN ( over radio ) : Yes , sir . ALLIE : Help ! Help me . Allie ? Over here . Help me ! Somebody , please . I don 't believe this . Why 'd you let him go down there ? I don 't know . You know , with that current , there 's no way he 's gonna be able to get back out of there . This 'll take him to the State Street wash , right ? Yeah , eventually . Then let 's go . CHUCK : Come on , we can save ' em over at the other end . Over here ! Help me ! Help ! I 'm here . Help me . Help me ! Help . Over here . Over here . ( siren wailing and indistinct radio transmission ) I hope you 're right about that thing . I-I am right . I 'll stake my life on it . You don 't have to stake your life on it . You already staked Gary 's . MARISSA : Chuck ? Marissa ! What are you doing here ? I heard it on the news . Is he all right ? I don 't know . Say a prayer . MAN : Look ! Look over there ! GARY : I got her . I got her . ( people exclaiming happily ) I want my Mommy . MAN : All right ! Mommy ! Allie ! Mommy ! ALLIE : I was so scared . Sir , is it true that they found the little girl with the help of a new device ? Well , umm ... Absolutely . Everything you heard is absolutely true . No , it 's not . I bet by tomorrow night , you 'll be selling thousands . I-I-I don 't know ... As Mr. Dalrymple 's official business associate , I would like to tell you and mention that ... It 's not for sale . What do you mean , it 's not for sale ? It 's not for sale . Yes , it is for sale . It 's going back to the drawing board . I 've still got some bugs to get out . Maybe next year . Uh , no . Mr. Dalrymple 's a little confused . We 've already started mass production of this item . And I 'll be right back . Apparently , this story has had a happy ending . Allie is safe . How are you , sweetie ? Thank you . She 's a tough little girl . Mommy , who was that man ? He 's the one that saved you , honey . Yeah , I believe you . Thanks for the help . Thanks .

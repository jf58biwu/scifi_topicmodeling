 Ow ! Damn ! A bee just stung me , eh ? Well , now , don 't you all take the cake ? Does your mom ever mix you up ? I 've come to you at great risk . I mean you no harm . - He knows about your sister . - How do I know you 're for real ? I can explain everything . First I want you to come somewhere with me . I want you to come with me to see my mother . Stay out of his way . He doesn 't want to hurt you . You can 't use your gun ! Stop right there , sir ! Come on . - Mulder ! - Scully , get the car ! This way . Damn . This way . Hey ! Jeremiah ! Jeremiah , stop ! What are you doing ? There 'll be more right behind him . - You can 't leave here ! - They 'll kill me ! I need your help ! My mother is dying ! Mulder ! Mulder ! Mulder ? Mulder ! Where are they going ? I don 't know . I need to know . Please . I don 't know . They 'll know where to find us . They 'll be waiting for us . Who ? Your government men . They 'll be waiting at the hospital with your mother . What can they do ? We 're working in the light . They can 't stop us without exposure , without consequence . You have to understand something . I must perish . Whatever the consequences to that end , they are incalculable to the preservation of the larger plan . The larger plan ? You mean colonization ? Hegemony , Mr. Mulder . A new origin of species . - I don 't understand . - I can show you . My mother is dying . I need to take you to see her right now . And if they are waiting for us , if they 're willing to kill me ... and face the consequences of their actions , to stand before your ineffectual justice system , I will be dead . I won 't be able to save your mother . The work will go on . The plan will continue to be executed . - Or you can stop it . - How can I stop it ? I can take you to a place , show you the work in progress where you can see - No ! There 's no time . Where you can see your sister . - He isn 't coming . - I told you . - Then where is he ? - I don 't know . Certainly he anticipated we 'd be here waiting . Unless we had a security leak . Who ? I 've come in receipt of some pictures ... of your visit to Mrs. Mulder 's summerhouse . Were you aware you were being photographed ? By whom ? I believe that can be determined by a simple planting of information ... to see where that information fows . What information ? That Mrs. Mulder 's life is in danger . That , left unprotected , she may come to an unnatural end . Scully . Scully , it 's me . Where are you ? I 'm right where you left me . I 'm sitting here in my car . Why ? Because you wouldn 't answer your phone , and I didn 't know what else to do . - Are you okay ? - Yes , I 'm fine . Listen . There 's going to be people looking for me . They 're going to think they can get tome through you . - Mulder - - Hold on . Just listen for a second . I need you to do something for me . I had to steal a car from an airport in Alberta . There 's going to be a record of me going through Canadian customs . I need you to cover my tracks . I also need you to know I 'm okay . I 'm fine , okay ? - Mulder , he 's coming after you . - Who ? The man you left for dead . He 's alive . That 's it for the gas . How much further from here ? About 20 miles . Maybe half that on foot over those hills . Let 's go . - Sir ? - Agent Scully . I heard you were looking for me . There 's been some concern about you and Agent Mulder . We 're fine , sir . We 've been searching for this man , Jeremiah Smith . - Did you find him ? - No . I received a memo from you that there 's more confusion about this man . That the Social Security Administration has five men with this name ... working in branch offices around the country ... with identical photo I.D. ' s . We ran a check on these men . All five have not reported to work in three days . Would you or Agent Mulder like to let me in on what it is your suspicions are ? I 'm afraid we haven 't exactly formulated any clear suspicions , sir . - Well , we have , Agent Scully . - Sir ? We were able to download the hard drive data ... from each of the five missing men 's Social Security workstations . In each case , we found an enormous amount of files and data ... that cannot be identified , do not correspond ... with any kind of accounting or document collection ... done as normal departmental business . The data was all locked in password files . How much of it is there ? Enough to fill seven ten-gigabyte hard drives . Roughly a billion entries . It appears to be some kind of personal record keeping or accounting . Could it be some kind of cryptogram ? If it is , I can 't crack it . I 'd like to get a copy of a portion of this . - I might be able to figure it out . - Seriously ? Maybe . There 's somebody I want to run it by . - Agent Mulder ? - No . I think , sir , this is more along my field of expertise . What happened to this man ? I wouldn 't touch the body , Mr. Mulder . There 's a work order here . It 's for yesterday . He 's only been here a little more than 24 hours . You know what killed him , don 't you ? It 's not much further . You 're looking at the future , Mr. Mulder . What is it ? A flowering shrub . But its specific epithet can 't be found on any of your taxonomic charts . Being grown for what ? Pollen . What is this ? - What 's going on here ? - What did I tell you ? That looks just like my sister . But that 's not possible . She 's no older than the day she was taken . Samantha ? Samantha ? Samantha ? Samantha ? Samantha ? Samantha , it 's me . It 's me , Fox , your brother . Do you remember me ? - What 's wrong with her ? - She has no language . What do you mean ? She 's a drone , Mr. Mulder , a worker . What are you talking about ? There 's more you should see so that you might understand . How 'd they get here ? They 're stationed here . They 're part of an agrarian workforce . - Who takes care of them ? - They take care of themselves . Parenting is unnecessary , a needless division of energy . They 're clones . Serial ovotypes . Have you seen enough ? We can 't stay around here much longer . I 'll go see if I can find some gas . Open the door , Agent Scully . - How did you know I was here ? - I 've been trying to reach Agent Mulder . I watched you enter the building . Where is he ? I don 't know . I have information for him , a matter that would concern him greatly . - Concern him how ? - Concerning his mother . - Has something happened to her ? - No . - No , not yet . - Is she in danger ? I prefer to speak with Agent Mulder directly . Let me just say she is unprotected . From whom ? From whom ? If you want to involve yourself , Agent Scully , you might do well to give this information to your partner . Not until you give me some information first . These are data entries taken from Social Security records . You 're going in the wrong direction . All beginning with the letters " S.E.P. " You know what these are . Confirm or deny . Smallpox eradication program . Smallpox . Don 't unlock doors you 're not prepared to go through . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - Leave it alone . Protect the mother . What are you doing ? - She 's coming with us . - You can 't do this . - She 's not your sister . - Then who is she ? You have a chance here to understand something so much greater , to comprehend it , to expose it . Then explain it to me . Explain it to me now ! - Bees . - It 's an apiary . Are bees what killed that man we found ? Yes . It 's probably not a good idea to hide in there . - You have no immunity to them . - But you do ? Somebody lead me . I can 't see anything . Is that the only way out ? I think we 've walked into our own trap . Come on ! - You busy , Agent Pendrell ? - No , I was just , uh - Good , because I think I 've made some headway on this data . - Can you call up the files ? - Yeah . I 've got to tell you I 've gotten nowhere . " S.E.P. " Smallpox eradication program . Smallpox ? How 'd you figure that ? I got lucky , but the key is in this first string of letters . Twenty-letter strings , 30 different variations . You say a 20-letter code to any scientist , and they immediately think ... protein amino acid sequence code , which is what this turned out to be . Protein sequence code for what ? The cowpox virus , the virus used to inoculate humans against smallpox . Okay , right . So these guys were keeping records of smallpox inoculations . Why ? I haven 't worked that out yet . But the big question is this second alphanumeric string - 15 digits . Yeah . I checked . Each one is different . An infinite number of variations . - An inventory . - Of what ? Of us . With all due respect , Agent Scully , it looks like something from the Hubble Telescope . Actually , it 's an image created by what 's called a confocal microscope . You 're looking at a three-dimensional picture of the location of a protein . In this case , cowpox structural protein number six . It 's one of the inoculants used in the smallpox vaccine . - Where 'd it come from ? - From me . I had a biopsy taken from the smallpox vaccination scar on my upper arm . Through a process called immunohistochemical staining ... and through the addition of an antibody for the cowpox virus six , I was able to get this picture of the location of a protein - a single , nonrandom protein pattern . I 'm not a scientist , and I don 't know that many people in this room - What I 'm saying is that I think this protein is a tag , some kind of genetic marker that was applied to me ... when I was inoculated against smallpox as a child . Why you ? Not just me , all of us , quite possibly anybody who 's been inoculated over the past 50 years . Agent Scully , frankly this sounds like ... something we might have expected from Agent Mulder . I had my doubts , and I 'm still not certain . But I performed the same procedure on Agent Pendrell . The location of the protein from his biopsy should be identical to mine , but it 's slightly different , which might correspond to the alphanumeric entries ... collected by the men at the , uh , Social Security Administration . So what you 're saying is we 're being cataloged , tagged and inventoried ? - By who ? - I don 't know . But it would have to be a government agency . - And to what purpose ? - I don 't know that either . I think the only man who might be able ... to give us that information is Jeremiah Smith . Agent Scully , can I see you outside for a moment ? Alone . Do you realize what you 're promoting in there ? You 're rounding these people up in the middle of a workday to imply that - I am a scientist . What I 'm promoting in there is reductive evidence . It 's the reason I was assigned to the X files in the first place , is it not ? To put Agent Mulder 's work to the test of science ? Excuse me . Scully . Where are you right now ? I 'm in Skinner 's office . Where are you ? I 'm still in Canada , but I 'm catching a plane soon . - I need you to meet me on the other end . - Just tell me where . - At the hospital where my mother is . - Mulder , I don 't - Her life depends upon me and my party getting there safely . - Who ? - Jeremiah Smith and someone else . I 'm gonna need some protection . - Believe me , you 're going to have it . - What do you mean ? There 's a lot of people who want to talk to Jeremiah Smith . They 'll get their chance . We 'll be there . Please . You can 't kill him . He can 't die . He must . That girl is my sister . He shows you pieces , but tells you nothing of the whole , because he 's inconsequential , a traitor to the project . Kill me . Let them go . - You 'd trade your life for his ? - For my mother 's . Everything dies . He 's in touch with the perimeter . I 'm sorry , sir . For security reasons - Five hours we 're out here swinging in the wind , Agent Scully . Something 's wrong . Something happened . You don 't have anyway of getting a hold of him ? This is beginning to seriously compromise ... our ability to treat patients . Just moment , sir . Oh , my God ! Mulder ? I can 't . There 's nothing - Mulder , you 're fr - No . You 're freezing . - He 's in shock - You 're in shock . - What happened ? She 'll never know . She 'll never know . We could have saved her , Scully . As long as she 's lying here , you can 't give up on her . I don 't care what the doctors say . I had one chance , and I let it slip away . You don 't know that . You can 't blame yourself for what you could only hope . He took me to a place with green fields , and I saw my sister . She was just a little girl . I 've seen too many things not to believe . I 've seen things , too , but there are answers to be found now . We have hope that there 's a place to start . That 's what I believe . You put such faith in your science , Scully , but ... the things I 've seen , science provides no place to start . Nothing happens in contradiction to nature , only in contradiction to what we know of it . And that 's a place to start . That 's where the hope is . I feel I came so close . I feel it too . I know it . - How ? - I was warned ... by a man we both know , who I believe knows the truth , who can lead us to a place to start . Mr. Mulder ? My name is Marita Covarrubias . I am the assistant to the special representative . Was he able to review the material I sent him ? - Yes . - And will he see me ? I 'm afraid he 's been called into something important . - Can I ask who sent you here ? - A friend . I 've been inquiring with each of the special representatives ... all month about the farmland in Canada . I 've been trying to get some reasons , and all I 've gotten are dead ends . I can tell you that farm has been abandoned . The crops you described were left to die . But they have been identified as ginseng . No evidence of beehives or bee husbandry was found . I know it 's not the answer you wanted . No . I , uh - Can I ask why this is so important to you ? I have suffered - I 've suffered some very personal losses recently and - I was - I was hoping ... that , um - Not everything dies , Mr. Mulder . I need to know the reasons why this should be . So that the work may continue , so that the project may proceed unabated ... by removing an unnecessary obstacle . What obstacle ? Agent Mulder , actually . If his mother were to die , he would - He what ? You see , the fiercest enemy is the man who has nothing left to lose . And you know how important Agent Mulder is to the equation .

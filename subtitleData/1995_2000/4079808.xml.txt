 It 's gonna crash . Are you saying these men are clones ? Unless you protect us , we are already dead . - Who is Mom talking to ? - Your sister . I 'm in danger , Fox . - Scully . - Scully , it 's me . Where are you ? Scully ? Are you there ? Scully ? Sir . Captain . - What have you got ? - I 'm not sure , sir . We picked up some paint approximately two minutes ago . - Looks like it 's just hanging there . - It 's 200 metres below the ice . Looks to be about 80 metres across and it 's noisy . - Noisy how ? - It 's emitting radio signals but it 's just random noise , sir . We can 't detect any pattern . Get me Pacific Command on the satellite uplink . Admiral . I don 't know what we 've found , but it appears to be some kind of craft . Yes , sir , that 's correct . But we 're on a cartography mission , Admiral . My crew isn 't prepared to ... Yes , sir . Understood , sir . Set a course . Heading 047 . Toward the object , sir ? Weapons room . Lock torpedoes on target . Prepare to fire on command . - Captain , shouldn 't we identify it ? - We have our orders , Lieutenant . But , sir ... The reactor 's gone down . - Engine room ! - That won 't work . We 're on battery power . I 'm going down there . Prepare to surface at once ! Surface into what ? We 're under 32 feet of glacial ice . X-Files Season 2 Episode 17 - End Game Scully ? Are you there ? Scully ? What 's going on ? No . Sorry . - Who was that ? - It 's a wrong number . - Where have you been , Mulder ? - I was trying to reach you . I went by your house , but you weren 't there . I got here as quickly as I could . - Why didn 't you call me ? - I did call . I couldn 't get through . - Put your hands against the wall . - Scully ... I said put your hands against the wall ! - What 's wrong ? - Do it ! Scully , it 's me . I don 't know who you are . I 'm gonna take my left hand and reach into my pocket for my ID , OK ? Don 't shoot me . - I got shot once and I didn 't much ... - I said keep your hands up ! Where is he ? That was him on the phone , wasn 't it ? Tell me where he is . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Scully ! He 's been here . Your partner is alive . He took her to get me . - But she wouldn 't have just let him in . - She might not have known who he was . She might have thought it was you . He 'll contact you . He 'll say he wants to make a trade-your partner 's life for mine . - Why does he want to kill you ? - Because I know how to kill him . - How ? - By piercing the base of his skull . - That 'll kill anybody . - Yes , but this is the only way to kill him . - I 'm fairly sure it 'll work . - Fairly sure ? He 's got powers I 've never seen before . If it doesn 't work , you could die . From what ? Their blood is toxic . Human exposure to it is fatal . - I know this must seem incredible ... - No . No , no . That 's just it . It doesn 't seem incredible at all . How do we find him ? We don 't . He 'll find us . - He 'll call . - You 're sure . - I know what he wants . - And if he doesn 't get it ? - I know this is hard for you , Fox . - No , it 's not hard . It 's unbelievable . - You don 't believe me . - After 22 years , why come back ? - I 've explained . - You 've explained only what you had to ! I know next to nothing about your so-called parents or the man who wants to kill them ! The men you 've been seeking are the progeny of two original visitors . Clones who have been attempting to establish a colony here since the late 1940s . - A colony ? - Loosely . The community , by necessity , is dispersed . Clones identical to my parents live in virtually every part of the country . What are they trying to accomplish ? It 's their belief that our stewardship of the planet is being forsaken and that , by default , they 'll become the natural heirs . And in the meantime ? Through hybridisation they 've been erasing that aspect which has forced them to scatter : ... their identical natures . All the clones worked in abortion clinics . Why ? Access to foetal tissue . Though the biologies are incompatible they finally found a way to combine human DNA with alien DNA . And this man ... Why has he been sent to kill them ? The experiments weren 't sanctioned . It was considered a dilution of their species , a pollution of their race . So a bounty hunter was dispatched to destroy them and terminate the colony . That 's a good story . But I 've heard a lot of good stories lately . I 've got no reason to lie to you . I 'm your sister , Fox . You have to trust me . Who is it ? Skinner . - Mulder ? - The door 's open . Make yourself at home . What 's going on , Agent Mulder ? Why are the lights out ? Orders from my ophthalmologist . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 've been trying to reach you and Agent Scully . I haven 't checked my messages . Agent Scully incarcerated four men with the federal marshal 's office and those men are now missing . It 's all right . It 's not him . What the hell is going on here , Mulder ? - This is my sister . Samantha Mulder . - What ? I 've no time to explain . Agent Scully is missing . What do you mean , missing ? - Hello . - Mulder , it 's me . - Scully , where are you ? - I don 't know . I 'm in a telephone booth . He 's got my gun , Mulder . He says he 'll kill me if you don 't give him what he wants . - What does he want ? - A woman who is with you . He says you 'll know what I 'm talking about . - Tell him we 'll negotiate . - He doesn 't wanna negotiate . - He says he wants to make a trade . - All right , let me speak to him ! He says be at Memorial Bridge in Bethesda in one hour . - Scully , I need more time than that . - Mulder ... Where is she ? What 's this negotiation ? We don 't have any time . If I ever needed your help , your trust , I need it now . Mulder 's in position . We just need to make him think we 're gonna make a trade . - We just need one shot . - To the base of the neck . These guys can hollow out a dime at 200 yards . Now , Samantha ... Do not take any unnecessary risks out there . Scully ? Bring her out . Take your shot when you got it . Step close . Right up close . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - I 'm OK . Samantha ! I lost the shot . There 's no way out . We got both sides of the bridge covered . Now let her go ! - Tell me where she is . - Let her go ! Samantha ! Samantha ! Spread it out . Clear . There 's some debris under the bridge . - Mulder ... - You should be in the hospital , Scully . I was discharged an hour ago . - Have they found anything yet ? - Nothing yet . Do you think she could have survived ? - Maybe . But the water 's 36ยบ . - Maybe she went into hypothermic shock . I 've heard about people that have lived after being in water like this eight to ten hours . Mulder , why didn 't you tell me on the phone that it was her ? - I couldn 't tell you . - Why not ? Because you 'd never let me go through with it . - Are you sure that it 's your sister ? - Why would you even question me on that ? Because back at the motel it was you . But it wasn 't you . Well , it was her ! - Then who is this man and where 's he ... - He 's an alien . - Is that what you 're gonna tell Skinner ? - I already told him . That was easy . Now I gotta tell my father . You didn 't have me come all this way to give me good news . What is it , Fox ? Samantha 's gone ... Dad . I lost her . What do you mean , you lost her ? There was a man . He was holding my partner hostage in exchange for Samantha . You let this man take your sister . Isn 't that what you 're trying to tell me ? I can 't explain it to you , but , um ... I believed I was doing the right thing , Dad . Was this your decision ? Yes . I 'll tell Mom . Do you realise what losing her again is going to do to your mother ? Do you ? I 'm sorry , Dad . I 'm sorry . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Your sis ... Samantha left this at the house for you . - Mulder . - Mulder , it 's me . Scully , she left a path in case we got separated . I think she 's alive . Mulder , I think you should come back as soon as you can . Why ? What 'd you find ? It 's your sister . We just pulled her body out of the river . Mulder , I 'm so sorry . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . You know ... Whatever you 're feeling , you can 't blame yourself . What about a second body ? Did you find a second body ? No , not yet . I 'll be there as soon as I can . - Agent Scully , something you need to see . - What is it ? It 's the body we pulled from the water . Something strange is happening . Federal agent . Keep your hands where I can see them and turn around . Slowly . Who are you ? - She 's dead , isn 't she ? - What the hell is going on ? Come , please . There 's not much time . Who are you ? Please . - It was all a lie . - We needed your help . - We knew you could be manipulated . - He 'll be coming . We must hurry now . Who ? The man who 's been sent to kill us . He 's dead . - How do you know ? - He was shot . In the back of the neck ! - How did he die ? - He fell off a bridge . With one of you . Then we don 't know for sure . You could have been followed . Come with me . This way , Agent Mulder . The rest of us are dispensable . She was the first . The one from which we all came . The one you must save . - I 'm not your saviour . - You must help us . You have no choice . No , I ... I do have a choice . My choice is to walk outta here . We know where your sister is . Ask yourself , Agent Mulder , how else would we know so much about her ? He 's here . I found one ! Sir , we 're gonna get you outta here ! - What about the others ? - We got real lucky . There are no others . No , wait ! There were women in here . - We looked . You 're the only one . - No ! Keep looking ! After treatment for smoke inhalation Agent Mulder was released from Samaritan Hospital in satisfactory condition . At his request , the abortion clinic where he was found has been searched repeatedly but the bodies of the women he insists perished were not found . My report on this case remains incomplete . Many aspects continue to defy explanation including the identities of the identical men and women . Agent Mulder 's claim of alien origins cannot be substantiated . The suspect in their disappearances is still at large . He has now been charged with the death of FBI Special Agent Barrett Weiss whose body is quarantined at the Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases . His cause of death involved a thickening of the blood . We now believe he was subjected to a virulent strain of virus whose origin and behaviour are also unexplainable . It is my hope that further analysis of this contagion will aid in the solution of this case . - This is a retrovirus ? - Yes . But we 've never seen anything like it . Do you recognise it ? Was the thickening of the blood an immunological response to the virus ? Apparently . Exposure to it triggers a massive production of red blood cells . Take a look at this . We took a second culture and were able to control its growth . What did you do ? All we did was lower the temperature by 5ยบ Fahrenheit . - So the virus is inhibited by cold . - Knocked out by it ! For some reason this retrovirus goes dormant at cold temperatures . We pulled a body from the river that was chilled near freezing . - When it started to thaw , it began to corrode . - Corrode ? If you find out anything else , you let me know as soon as possible . You wanted to see me ? - How was the opera ? - I 've never slept better . I don 't like these hasty public meetings , Agent Mulder . - I 'm sorry . I need your help . - It 's over . The fat lady is singing . I need to know what you know . - OK . They 're all dead . - No ! One of them is alive . The one who was sent to kill them . Where is he ? A nuclear submarine located his craft in the Beaufort Sea five days ago . They were ordered to destroy it , but were disabled . An attack fleet left Anchorage this morning to make sure this man does not leave . I gotta get up there . You 'll only win the war if you pick the right battles , Agent Mulder . This is a battle you can 't win . Mulder , it 's me . Are you there ? Scully-when you get this message I 'll be too far away for you to stop me but where I 'm going I can 't allow you to follow . I won 't let you jeopardise your life and your career for reasons purely personal to me . You were right , Scully . You said a line has to be drawn somewhere . And I 'm drawing it for you here . I 'll contact you when I can . Sir ? I 'm sorry to come unannounced , sir , but your assistant wasn 't at her desk . - What is it , Scully ? - May we speak off the record , sir ? - About ? - Agent Mulder . He 's gone . - Where ? - I don 't know . I was hoping you 'd tell me . Agent Mulder told me he was going to take some time off after what he 'd been through . He told me the same thing , but I don 't think this matter with his sister is settled . Sir , is there any way that you can reach him through unofficial channels ? - I can 't help you , Scully . - Please ! Agent Scully , you and I both have a greater responsibility to consider-to the FBI . Mulder 's actions are in violation of his duties , his oath of trust and Bureau protocol . - He 's risked my position , your life ... - Agent Mulder saved my life ! If he wanted or expected you to do the same , he would have told you where he was going . Please close the door on your way out , Agent Scully . Where 's Mulder ? Sorry . I must have the wrong apartment . Where 's Mulder ? - I need to know , dammit ! - You 've mistaken me for someone else . I 'm losing time ! I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . Excuse me . Did you tell her what she needed to know ? How hard do you wanna make this ? No harder than it has to be . I 've killed men for far less . You pull that trigger , you 'll be killing two men . Now , I wanna know where Mulder is . Agent Mulder flew to Tacoma , Washington . From there he caught a military plane to Deadhorse , Alaska . He used his FBI credentials to charter an all-terrain vehicle . It 's still a ten-mile hike across the ice . These are the coordinates of his final destination . - How did you get this ? - Unofficial channels . Hey ! Stop ! - Who are you ? - Lieutenant Terry Wilmer . Step outta there ! Come out ! What happened to you ? I don 't know . We , uh ... We just lost power . We ... we drifted under the ice for days . Then , um ... then we hit a , uh ... Don 't look at me ! Face forward ! We hit a shallow patch and punched through , OK ? That 's what happened . So why did you run ? A man came . He , um ... He sealed most of the men below decks without any air and , uh ... And then he started to execute the rest of us . Every ... They 're all dead . I , uh ... I thought you were him . I didn 't know if you were him . How is it you managed to survive ? I hid under the body of the chief petty officer . OK ? I , um ... I played dead . What 's this for ? - What , are you crazy ? - No . I 'm just tired . You 're not getting back to your ship until I get the truth . Tell me where my sister is . - I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . - Base of the neck ! Tell me how I can find her and I 'll let you get back to your ship before it 's destroyed ! Please ... Please , you 're making a really big mistake . If I wanted to , I could have killed you many times before . Where is she ? Is the answer to your question worth dying for ? Is that what you want ? Where is she ? Just tell me where she is ! She 's alive . Can you die now ? Agh ! No change in BP or pulse . I 'm Dana Scully , his partner . What are his vitals ? - He 's suffering from extreme hypothermia . - No ! Get him out of the tub . - He 's lost all his body heat . - If you keep him in there , you 'll kill him . The cold is all that 's keeping him alive . His heart stopped ! - Give me one amp of epinephrine ! - You don 't know what you 're dealing with ! He has been exposed to a retrovirus resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome . - I want you out of my ER right now . Nurse ! - Yes . Ma 'am ... His blood has thickened . That 's why his heart is failing . His heart is failing because he 's lost all his body heat . No , the only thing saving him right now is the hypometabolic state induced by the cold . Now , if you don 't do what I 'm saying , you are going to kill him ! Let 's get him out of that tub now . Charged and ready . - Clear . - Clear . - No rhythm . - No . - Clear . - Clear . - I 'm picking up a faint pulse . - Yes ! I want a digoxin 0.1mg IV . Hang a heparin drip of 1,000 units per hour and get two units of fresh frozen plasma now . - This patient 's not even ... - He 's going to make it . Transfusions and an aggressive treatment with antiviral agents have resulted in a steady but gradual improvement in Agent Mulder 's condition . Blood tests have confirmed his exposure to the still unidentified retrovirus whose origin remains a mystery . The search team that found Agent Mulder located neither the submarine nor the man he was looking for . Several aspects of this case remain unexplained suggesting the possibility of paranormal phenomena . But I am convinced that to accept such conclusions is to abandon all hope of understanding the scientific events behind them . Many of the things I 've seen have challenged my faith and my belief in an ordered universe . But this uncertainty has only strengthened my need to know to understand , to apply reason to those things which seem to defy it . It was science that isolated the retrovirus Agent Mulder was exposed to . And science that allowed us to understand its behaviour . And ultimately ... it was science that saved Agent Mulder 's life . Hey ! How you feelin ' ? Like I got a bad case of freezer burn . How did I get here ? A naval reconnaissance squad found you . They choppered you to Eisenhower Field . - Thanks for ditching me . - I am sorry . I couldn 't let you risk your life on this . Did you find what you were looking for ? No ... No . But I found something I thought I 'd lost . Faith to keep looking .

YOU KNEW FROM SQUARE ONE . LOOK AT HIM . HE 'S UP TO HIS EYEBALLS IN THIS THING . NO , QUENTIN . THAT 'S HOW THEY STAY HIDDEN . YOU KEEP EVERYONE SEPARATED , SO THE LEFT HAND DOESN 'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS DOING . THE BRAIN NEVER COMES OUT IN THE OPEN . WHOSE BRAIN ? IT 'S ALL THE SAME MACHINE , RIGHT ? THE PENTAGON , MULTI - NATIONAL CORPORATIONS , THE POLICE ! IF YOU DO ONE LITTLE JOB , YOU BUILD A WIDGET IN SASKATOON , AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW , IT 'S TWO MILES UNDER THE DESERT , THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF A DEATH MACHINE . I WAS RIGHT .

IT 'S A HEADLESS BLUNDER OPERATING UNDER THE ILLUSION OF A MASTER PLAN . CAN YOU GRASP THAT ? BIG BROTHER IS NOT WATCHING YOU . WHAT KIND OF FUCKING EXPLANATION IS THAT ? IT 'S THE BEST YOU 'RE GONNA GET . I LOOKED , AND THE ONLY CONCLUSION I COULD COME TO IS THAT THERE IS NOBODY UP THERE . SOMEBODY HAD TO SAY , " YES , " TO THIS THING . - WHAT THING ? - ONLY WE KNOW WHAT IT IS . WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS . WE KNOW MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE . I MEAN , SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE KNOWN SOMETIME BEFORE THEY GOT- - THEY GOT FIRED OR VOTED OUT OR SOLD IT . BUT IF THIS PLACE EVER HAD A PURPOSE , THEN IT GOT MISCOMMUNICATED OR ... OR ... OR LOST IN THE SHUFFLE . I MEAN , THIS IS AN ACCIDENT ; A ... A FORGOTTEN PERPETUAL PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT . DO YOU THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO ASK QUESTIONS ? ALL THEY WANT IS A ... IS A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND A FAT PAY CHECK . I MEAN , I LEANED ON MY SHOVEL FOR MONTHS ON THIS ONE . THIS WAS A GREAT JOB . WHY PUT PEOPLE IN IT ? BECAUSE IT 'S HERE . YOU HAVE TO USE IT , OR YOU ADMIT IT 'S POINTLESS . BUT IT ... IT IS POINTLESS . QUENTIN , THAT 'S MY POINT . WHAT HAVE WE COME TO ? IT 'S SO MUCH WORSE THAN I THOUGHT . NOT REALLY . JUST MORE PATHETIC . YOU MAKE ME SICK , WORTH . I MAKE ME SICK TOO . WE 'RE BOTH PART OF THE SYSTEM . I DREW A BOX . YOU WALK A BEAT . IT 'S LIKE YOU SAID , QUENTIN . JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN , KEEP IT SIMPLE , JUST LOOK AT WHAT 'S IN FRONT OF YOU . NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THE BIG PICTURE . LIFE 'S TOO COMPLICATED . I MEAN , LET 'S FACE IT , THE REASON WE 'RE HERE IS THAT IT 'S OUTTA CONTROL . THIS IS HOW WE RUIN THE WORLD ? WELL , DUH ! HAVE YOU BEEN ON GLUE ALL YOUR LIVES ? I FELT GUILTY FOR RUINING THE WORLD SINCE I WAS LIKE SEVEN . GOD ! IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO BLAME , THROW A ROCK . WELL , I FEEL BETTER . THAT 'S WHY YOU STAYED WITH US . TO CONFESS . STILL LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BUST , QUENTIN ? QUENTIN , STOP IT ! STOP IT ! WE NEED HIM . WHAT FOR ? HAVE YOU GONE ABSOLUTELY MAD ? HE 'S THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLACE . WORTH . H-HI . SO THERE 'S THIS OUTER SHELL ? YEAH . AND IT 'S A CUBE , RIGHT ? LIKE THIS ? I ASSUME SO . ARE THERE ANY DOORS ? THERE 'S ONE DOOR . WHERE ? WHERE THE DOOR GUY PUT IT . Worth : SIX GUESSES AND IT 'S SEALED FROM THE OUTSIDE . AND WHAT ARE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE OUTER SHELL ? 434 FEET SQUARE . MAY I ? COME ON , HONEY , SLIDE OVER . 14 BY 14 BY 14 . THE INNER CUBE CAN 'T BE FLUSH TO THE SHELL WALL . I KNOW THAT . THERE 'S A SPACE . ONE CUBE ? I DON 'T KNOW . IT MAKES SENSE . OKAY , WELL ... THE BIGGEST THAT THE CUBE CAN BE THEN IS 26 ROOMS HIGH , 26 ROOMS ACROSS , SO ... 17,576 ROOMS . 17,576 ROOMS ? OH , GOD . THAT MAKES ME QUEASY . DESCARTES . LEAVEN , YOU ARE A GENIUS . WHAT ? WHAT ? CARTESIAN COORDINATES . OF COURSE . CODED CARTESIAN COORDINATES . THEY 'RE USED IN GEOMETRY TO PLOT POINTS ON A THREE-DIMENSIONAL GRAPH . IN ENGLISH ? SLOWER . I 'M SURE THESE NUMBERS ARE MARKERS . A GRID REFERENCE LIKE ... LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE ON A MAP . THE NUMBERS TELL US WHERE WE ARE INSIDE THE CUBE . WELL , WHERE ARE WE ? IT WORKS ! OKAY , UM , ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS ADD THE NUMBERS TOGETHER . X-COORDINATE IS 19 , Y IS ... 26 ROOMS . SO THAT PLACES US ... SEVEN ROOMS FROM THE EDGE . ALL RIGHT . LET 'S GO . JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY , I MEAN , DON 'T HIT ME AGAIN OR ANYTHING , BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN YOU GET THERE ? MAYBE WE CAN GET THE DOOR OPEN . OH . WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET AROUND THE TRAPS . I 'M DEALING WITH THAT , HOLLOWAY . I 'M LOOKING FOR PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS HERE . WELL , YOU HAVEN 'T FOUND ANY YET . WE 'LL CUT THE RISK , WITH THE NUMBERS AND THE BOOT . WORTH WILL GO IN FIRST . NO , HE WON 'T , QUENTIN . WE TAKE TURNS . RELAX . ROOM FOR TWO IN THERE ? WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? THESE COORDINATES ; 14 , 27 , 14 . WHAT ABOUT ' EM ? WELL , THEY DON 'T MAKE SENSE . ASSUMING THE CUBE IS 26 ROOMS ACROSS , THERE CAN 'T BE A COORDINATE LARGER THAN 26 . IF THIS WERE RIGHT , THEN WE WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF THE CUBE . NO , NOT OUTSIDE OF THE CUBE . OH . GUESS THAT MEANS WE 'RE NOT HAVING DINNER . TRAP . TRAP . TRAP . TRAP . TRAP . TRAP . TRAP . TRAP ! TRAP ! SOUND ACTIVATED . BOO ! LOVELY . HOW COME THE SOUND OF THE DOOR OPENING DIDN 'T SET IT OFF ? MUST BE RIGGED TO IGNORE IT . SO THAT 'S IT ? THE EDGE IS SURROUNDED BY TRAPS .

GET IT OFF HIM . WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS . WE JUST HAVE TO BE QUIET . THAT 'S PRETTY FUCKING QUIET . I 'M GLAD YOU 'RE ON HIS SIDE , WORTH , 'CAUSE YOU 'RE UP . AND HE 'S NOT COMING . OF COURSE HE IS . NO WAY ! YOU 'RE NOT LEAVING HIM BEHIND . HE 'S UNPREDICTABLE . WHEN WE GET TO THE EDGE WE CAN COME BACK FOR HIM , BUT HE 'LL GET SOME - BODY KILLED HERE . AM I RIGHT ? SHAME ON YOU . WILL YOU LOOK AT YOURSELVES ? WHAT HAVE YOU TURNED INTO ? THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN OUR LIVES AWAY , BUT WE 'RE STILL HUMAN BEINGS . THAT 'S ALL WE 'VE GOT LEFT . WE 'LL COME BACK FOR HIM .

I CAN 'T THINK ANY MORE . SURE YOU CAN . IT 'S YOUR GIFT . IT 'S NOT A GIFT . IT 'S JUST A BRAIN . LET HER SLEEP FOR AWHILE . WE HAVEN 'T SLEPT IN FUCK KNOWS HOW LONG . ALL RIGHT . ONE HOUR . HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU GONNA KNOW HOW LONG AN HOUR IS ? AN HOUR IS AS LONG AS I SAY . WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? WE HAVE TO MAKE IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM . IT 'LL BE QUIET THERE AND YOU CAN CONCENTRATE . YOU JUST WANNA LEAVE THEM ? THEY 'RE TRAPS , LEAVEN . WE 'RE THE KEY . I 'LL GET US DOWN THERE . YOU 'LL THINK US OUT . BELIEVE IN ME . TRY AND SEE WHAT I SEE ; HOW MY MIND WORKS , THE FLASH WHEN I LOOK INTO SOMEONE 'S HEAD , LIKE A FUCKING X-RAY . I LOOKED THROUGH THE WALLS . I DREAMED HIM , AT HIS DESK , DESIGNING EVERYTHING . YEAH . HE CAN 'T LET YOU SOLVE THE PUZZLE , SEE ? 'CAUSE THERE IS A PURPOSE . WE ARE THE PURPOSE . THE CUBE ... IS US . QUENTIN ... WE FIT , LIKE NUMBERS . A MAN AND A WOMAN ; TWO HALVES OF THE EQUATION . I 'LL TAKE YOU DOWN ; THE PERFECT KEY . I 'LL SLIP YOU IN THE LOCK . LEAVEN . IT 'S TIME TO GO DOWN . GETAWAY FROM HER . LEAVEN . THEY 'RE FUCKING SPIES : HIM , THE RETARD . HOLLOWAY HAD OUTSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT MY FAMILY . BUT SHE SLIPPED UP , DIDN 'T SHE ? SHE CROSSED THE LINE . YOU DROPPED HER . JUST GO , QUENTIN . GIVE US THE BOOT , YOU PIG . YOU DON 'T WANT THE BOOT . YOU WANT TO COME WITH US , WORTH ? DOWN THE HATCH . WHAT THE FUCK 'S WITH HIM ? HOW DID HE ... ? IT 'S ... IT 'S ... IT 'S " THE WREN " . THE OLD WRENSTER . HOW COULD ... ? WE 'RE GOING IN CIRCLES . THAT CAN 'T BE . WHERE ARE WE ? I DON 'T KNOW . WHERE ARE WE ? YOU FIGURE IT OUT . YOU HAVEN 'T DONE ANYTHING . ALL YOU DID WAS FREAK OUT , YOU ... MURDERER ! I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT , WORTH . THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF HERE . GETAWAY FROM ME . WASN 'T RENNES KILLED IN THAT ROOM ? HOW COME THERE 'S NOTHING OUT THERE ? IT 'S THE EDGE . WE WEREN 'T AT THE EDGE BEFORE . WHERE 'S THE ROOM THAT KILLED RENNES ? FUCK OFF ! OH , THAT WAS GOOD . WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ? WE 'RE DEAD ANYWAYS . HEY ! LISTEN TO WHAT I 'M SAYING . THERE WAS A ROOM THERE BEFORE . WE HAVEN 'T BEEN MOVING IN CIRCLES . THE ROOMS HAVE . OF COURSE . THE ROOMS . THAT EXPLAINS THE THUNDER AND THE SHAKING . WE 'VE BEEN SHIFTING THE WHOLE TIME . IT 'S ... IT 'S THE ONLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION . I 'M SUCH AN IDIOT . WHAT ARE YOU ON TO , LEAVEN ? GIVE ME A MINUTE . OKAY . THE NUMBERS ARE MARKERS , POINTS ON A MAP , RIGHT ? RIGHT . AND HOW DO YOU MAP A POINT THAT KEEPS MOVING ? PERMUTATIONS . PERMU-WHAT ? PERMUTATIONS . A LIST OF ALL THE COORDINATES THAT THE ROOM PASSES THROUGH . LIKE A MAP THAT TELLS YOU WHERE THE ROOM STARTS , HOW MANY TIMES IT MOVES , AND WHERE IT MOVES TO . A NUMBER TELLS YOU ALL THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . SEE , I 'VE ONLY BEEN LOOKING AT ONE POINT ON THE MAP , WHICH IS PROBABLY THE STARTING POSITION . ALL I SAW WAS WHAT THE CUBE LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT STARTED TO MOVE . OKAY , SO IT 'S MOVING . HOW DO WE GET OUT ? 27 ! I KNOW WHERE THE EXIT IS . WHERE ? STAY AWAY FROM ME . BACK OFF , QUENTIN . I JUST WANT TO KNOW . DON 'T YOU WANT TO KNOW ? YOU REMEMBER THAT ROOM WE PASSED THROUGH BEFORE ? THE ONE WITH THE COORDINATE LARGER THAN 26 ? WHAT ABOUT IT ? THAT COORDINATE PLACED THE ROOM OUTSIDE THE CUBE . A BRIDGE ! RIGHT . BUT ONLY IN ITS ORIGINAL POSITION . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? UH ... LOOK . THE ROOM STARTS OFF AS A BRIDGE . AND THEN IT ... IT MOVES ITS WAY THROUGH THE MAZE , WHICH IS WHERE WE RAN INTO IT . BUT AT SOME POINT , IT MUST RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION . SO THE BRIDGE IS ONLY A BRIDGE ... FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME . THIS THING IS LIKE A GIANT COMBINATION LOCK . WHEN THE ROOMS ARE IN THEIR STARTING POSITION , THE LOCK IS OPEN . BUT WHEN THEY MOVE OUT OF ALIGNMENT , THE LOCK CLOSES . WITH A STRUCTURE THIS SIZE , IT MUST TAKE DAYS FOR THE ROOMS TO COMPLETE A FULL CYCLE . SO WHEN DOES IT OPEN ? DON 'T . TO FIND THE ORIGINAL COORDINATES , THE NUMBERS ARE ADDED TOGETHER TO FIND THE PERMUTATIONS , THEN SUBTRACTED FROM ONE ANOTHER . THAT 'S IT . THIS ROOM MOVES TO ZERO , ONE , AND NEGATIVE ONE ON THE X-AXIS , TWO , FIVE AND NEGATIVE SEVEN ON Y , AND ONE , NEGATIVE ONE AND ZERO ON Z. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? YOU SUCK AT MATH . OKAY , I NEED THE ROOM NUMBERS AROUND US AS A REFERENCE POINT . Worth : SIX , SIX , SIX . EIGHT , NINE , SEVEN . FOUR , SIX , SIX . FIVE , SIX , SEVEN . EIGHT , NINE , EIGHT . OKAY ? YES . AND FIVE , FOUR , FIVE . DID YOU GET THAT ? SIX , FIVE , SIX . SEVEN , SEVEN , EIGHT . FOUR , SIX , TWO . THAT 'S ENOUGH . X IS 17 , Y IS 25 , AND Z IS 14 . WHICH MEANS THIS ROOM MAKES TWO MORE MOVES BEFORE RETURNING TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION . DO WE HAVE TIME ? MAYBE . THEN LET 'S GO . CAN YOU WORK THE TRAPS FOR THIS SYSTEM ? FUCK THE TRAPS . LET 'S GET TO THE BRIDGE . WELL YOU THREW OUT OUR LAST BOOT , YOU FUCKING IDIOT . TECHNICALLY I CAN IDENTIFY THE TRAPS . TECHNICALLY ? I THOUGHT THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY PRIME NUMBERS , THEY 'RE NOT .

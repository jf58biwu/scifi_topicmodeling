I 'm sorry to be leaving . At least you didn 't miss the fireworks . Did you hear about this ? - No . - Dr. Mitchell was arrested last night ... for killing that administrator and making it look like a Panalex O.D. Dr. Jekyll even confessed . Wonder how they got that out of him . Well , I guess a taste of his own medicine . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Man ] Bring him on down here . Sport-utility versus pedestrian . John Doe . Pulse , 120 . B.P. 82 over 60 . Respiration , 30 . - Patrick . Patrick . - Intermittent awareness . Somebody said he was running to a phone booth three blocks from here when he got nailed .

Call Radiology and get a head C.T. , stat . - Patrick . Patrick . - This is Dr. Hargadon . I need a C. T. , stat , please . [ Jarod ] Patrick . Kara , take over from here . [ Ringing ] [ Honking , Tires Screech ] [ Ringing Continues ] Hello . The mysterious Mr. Harper . Huh . So that 's how you look without the beard . What do you want ? Cooperation . Two million by this time tomorrow ... or the next time you see little Patrick , he 'll be wearing a toe tag . I 'll give you whatever you want . Please - don 't hurt my son . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . The rules are simple . No law . No media . Break a rule , Patrick dies . I 'll pay you . Just , please , don 't hurt my son . Look behind the phone book . Two million in 24 hours . I 'll call you with the details . [ Sighs ] Tell Patrick that his father love - [ Dial Tone ] - [ Brakes Squeak ] - [ Engine Rumbles ] [ Knocking ] - Hey ! - [ Knocking Continues ] [ Car Alarm Chirps ] George Harper . Patrick . George Harper . You 're going to be okay , Patrick . You 're lucky I don 't kill you now . Your hands . - Who the hell are you ? - George Harper . You tell that to someone who 's not his head of security . - Now , let 's try this again . - [ Gun Cocks ] Who are you ? - [ Exhales ] - [ Broots ] That 's Jarod , all right . Clarkston Pharmaceuticals . They make a very popular antidepressant called Panalex . Jarod was employed there for three weeks . - Who did he help ? - Nobody . Well , he wasn 't stealing the formula for Flintstone vitamins . Hold onto yourJockeys . A major shareholder in Clarkston is - [ Breathes Heavily ] Mr. Raines ? - [ Broots Laughs ] - [ Raines ] Everyone needs a nest egg . [ Raines ] Continue . [ Wheels Squeaking ] Um - Well , uh , it 's a - a solid lead . It means nothing till we find Jarod 's emotional purpose . Jarod 's purpose is to harass the Centre . He 's after my stock . If he were after your stock , you 'd be broke . Jarod is driven by altruism . You want him out there , trying to help the little guy . The answer is the little guy . If you want to find Jarod , find the person he 's trying to help . [ Water Dripping ] I want my dad . I want my dad . [ Door Squeaks ] [ Breathing Heavily ] Dr. Gordon to the O.R. post-op . Dr. Gordon to the O.R. post-op . - [ Chattering ] - [ Phone Ringing ] [ Sighs ] Is he gonna make it ? It 's too soon to tell . But he 's going to be in that bed for at least two more weeks . Look , doc , I was a little rough on you back there , but - You want Patrick back just as much as his father does . I understand . You said the kidnapper left a cell phone for you . I 'll handle it from here . Mr. Alomar , he saw me . By becoming George Harper , I bought that boy one more day of life . Why don 't you tell me how it happened ? Mr. Harper got the note after 3 : 00 . Called me , said to meet him at the phone booth . A limo drops off Patrick every morning at school , picks him up in the afternoon . Today , the driver found only this . Did you talk to this limo driver ? He found the backpack where Patrick usually waits . We 've known this guy for years . He 's been with us a long time . But I 've run a new background check on him , just in case . Mr. Harper 's ready to pay off this bastard . But I know how these people think . I 'm ex-F.B.I. Worked a few abductions . More than likely , he 'll - He 'll probably kill Patrick just so he won 't I.D. him . [ Exhales ] He is a professional . He wants us to feel a total loss of control ... so he can fulfill his fantasy of power . What do you know about kidnappers , Doctor ? When I was a boy , I was stolen from my parents . I can help you get Patrick back ... but you 're going to have to trust me . Otherwise , by this time tomorrow , Patrick could be dead . Keep the phone ... for now . - A lunch box ! - [ Chuckles ] You 're gonna be starting special school soon , Jarod . Is that why those teachers came to see me yesterday ? Yes , it is . They say you have a gift . Course , I already knew you were smart as a whip . You 're gonna love it , Jarod . I am so proud of you . I 'm the proudest mommy in the world . [ Bell Ringing ] [ Kids Chattering ] Is there something I can help you with ? - You 're a teacher . - Yes . I 'm George Harper . Oh ! This is quite an honor . I - I 'm Judith Peck . Oh , Hayvenhurst is a much better place thanks to your scholarship fund , sir . You 've - You 've opened the school to a number of disadvantaged students . I 'm sorry if I seem a little surprised to see you - I understand . I 'm here about my son . This is Martin Benton . He oversees security for the school . I 'm so sorry about this , Mr. Harper . Nothing like this has ever happened here , sir. I - I 'm shocked . I strongly urge you to call the police . I can 't . That 's one of the kidnapper 's demands . If I could just find something , a-anything that would help . Well , he was in session after school . Um , reading studies , I think . - Reading studies ... for the dyslexia . - Right . - He gets out around 3 : 00 . - With the special ed kids . Most of the others are gone by 2 : 00 . [ Sighs ] He doesn 't want to be singled out . - He hates being special . - Right . He just wants to be a regular kid . That 's why he 's always reading comic books in class . This is where he usually waits for his ride . Isn 't that right , Judith ? Right . Is there anything we can do , Mr. Harper ? Yes . Nothing . Don 't contact the police or the media . I beg of you . Patrick 's life depends on it . Of course . [ Jarod ] I was stolen , taken from my home in the middle of the night . [ Gasps ] It 's all coming back to me , Sydney . Repressed memories . They often resurface during traumatic events , Jarod . But those memories themselves , they are not as important as how you face them . How do you face yours ? How do you live with what happened to me ? [ Muffled Grunts ] Jarod , nothing can justify what happened to you . But what you 've been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years - [ Sighs ] That tells me something right - Came out of something very , very wrong . It 's like a nightmare . It all keeps coming back in pieces . [ Struggling , Groans ] First the fear ... and then the panic . The shooting through your nerves kind . I 'm a child again . It 's - It 's dark ... and I 'm alone . All I can think about is seeing my family again . I want my world to be like it was . [ Young Jarod Singing , Indistinct ] When can I see my daddy ? Harper will pay , and you 'll get your cut . Tomorrow . Yeah . The kid 's having his last meal right now . [ Clears Throat ] [ Grunts ] [ Miss Parker ] You 're late . [ Broots Clears Throat ] Uh , Clarkston Pharmaceuticals - Um , Jarod was a national rep ... in , uh , Cupertino and Sunnyvale , California . Have you found any evidence of child abduction ? Why would he , Syd ? A hunch . Play the tape , Mr. Broots . [ Whispering ] Syd , they made me do this . - [ Clicks ] - [ Mouths Words ] [ Jarod ] How do you live with what happened to me ? [ Sydney ] Jarod , nothing can justify what happened to you . But what you 've been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years - - That tells me something right - - [ Jarod ] Came out of s [ Stops Tape ] - And for two years ... I 've been saying your personal connection toJarod has hindered this pursuit . This is proof . My conversations with Jarod are nothing new . They keep us from him . They keep him from disappearing . Sydney ... he 's right . Two million . I got what I could from Patrick 's room , like you asked . But , I still don 't see how it helps . If I 'm going to be George Harper ... I have to understand his life ... and his son 's . I don 't want the kidnapper to catch me in a lie . Limo driver 's clean . Checked some past business associates for possible motives . Nothing . F.B.I. files show no kidnappers with a similar M.O. At least , not in the last five years . All we can do is hope this bastard keeps his word ... and we 'll have Patrick back tomorrow . This is Patrick 's mother . [ Alomar ] Chloe . Great lady . Passed away in ' 96 . Patrick loves puzzles . Hmm . They help him to think . That 's what he always says . I bought him this one . Sometimes when Mr. Harper 's working late , I help Patrick out . Yeah , well , kind of . Kid 's way faster than me . - [ Sighs ] - You okay ? Those abductions I worked for the bureau - The things some of these guys do to those kids , it 's just , uh - [ Sighs ] [ Monitors Beeping Slowly ] We 'll get him back . [ Sighs ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Window Bangs ] [ Muffled Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Stanton to C.C.U. , stat . Dr. Stanton to C.C.U. , stat . [ Sighs ] [ Window Bangs ] [ Jarod Gasps , Muffled Screaming ] [ Grunts , Gasping ] [ Exhales ] - [ Monitors Beeping Slowly ] - [ Harper ] Patrick . Patrick . - Jarod ? - He 's waking up . Mr. Harper , my name is Jarod . He 's going to help us , Mr. Harper . Is Patrick here ? No , sir . He 's not . But he 's going to be just fine . I promise you . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Syd , we 've been ordered to Sunnyvale . Broots found this . Could beJarod 's handiwork . We leave in an hour . Raines is sending Willie with us to keep us honest . But what he doesn 't know is that Sam is already on his way . I 'll be ready . [ Sighs ] I hate myself for siding with Raines , but the creep 's got a point . This emotional umbilical you have with Jarod is ... becoming a problem . In your eyes . Jarod is doing your work out there , isn 't he ? - I could say the same about you . - Mmm . His mind games don 't work on me anymore . You can 't make that claim . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Like you said , we 've been ordered to Sunnyvale . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Has the kidnapper called ? Where 's my boy ? He 'll be back by the end of the day , sir . [ Sighs ] When he was a newborn , I 'd go into his room late at night to check on him . I 'd stand over him until my eyes adjusted to the dark . And when I 'd see him breathe , I 'd know he was okay . New parents , they must be very nervous . New ? I still check on Patrick every night . But what good did it do ? I should 've been there . If you had been there , you would 've found the backpack , not your driver . That 's all . You know , since Chloe died , it 's just Patrick and me . I lost her in a room just like this . I promised her we 'd be a strong family . Jarod - I 'll get him back . [ Kids Chattering ] [ Man ] Jessica . [ Benton ] Need some help ? I 'm sorry . I was just trying to put myself into Patrick 's shoes . Well , you 're in the right place . He always reads his comic books right here . [ Alomar ] You must be lost . Kidnapper calls in less than two hours . I went to see Harper . You weren 't there . - What are you doing here ? - Following you . Why aren 't you at the hospital ? I have two hours left . There 's still some time . Time for what ? For this . He was here . He was buying comic books here . The kidnapper grabbed him over here . He emptied out the backpack ... put the note inside , and he left it across the street for the driver to find . And nobody saw a thing . [ Sighs ] Almost nobody . So that 's how E.R. doctors do it - sugar rush . - [ Sighs ] - There . [ Jarod ] Patrick . [ Screaming ] [ Jarod Sighs ] No plates . [ Sighs Angrily ] Tape 's useless ! Ski mask covered his face . We 're down to the wire . [ Breathing Heavily ] Got it . [ Jarod ] I want to check up on Harper before I get the call . I almost bought your little blowup back there . That was my office on the phone . When I ran the background check on the driver , I ran one on you too . You 're a tough man to track , Dr. Pearce . Maybe that 's 'cause you died in 1979 . You didn 't pretend to be Harper in that phone booth . You made a deal with the kidnapper . How much is he paying you ? [ Phone Rings ] Look , I know that you think about Patrick like he was your own son . You probably saw some horrible things happen to children when you worked for the F.B.I. You 're afraid the same thing is gonna happen to him . - But I swear to you , I want to help this boy . - [ Ringing ] And I can 't help him unless I answer this phone call . [ Ringing Continues ] Please , trust me . - [ Flips Phone Open ] - George Harper . Same phone booth . Ten minutes . - [ Dial Tone ] - Ten minutes . [ Tires Squeal ] Miss Parker , I 've got him . Go . Go . Kidnapper 's probably watching . Get off here . I 'll maintain visual . You pull anything , I 'll kill you . I 'd expect nothing less . [ Kidnapper 's Phone Ringing ] I 'm here . I 'm here . Take the money and cross the street to the green garbage can . [ Exhales ] When do I see Patrick ? As soon as I get paid . How do I know you 're telling the truth ? Where is my son ? - Hello ? - Harper , I said no law . - What are you talking about ? - [ Car Doors Close ] The deal 's off . The boy is dead . No ! No ! No ! You 're a businessman . Just name your price . I 'll pay it . Another two million in three hours . I see one badge , your son stops breathing . I want to talk to my son . I want to know that he 's still alive . I love you , Daddy . Intelligent boy you got there , Mr. Harper . Who says he needs special ed ? Keep the phone . I 'll call . [ Panting ] - [ Panting ] - [ Panting ] [ Car Starts ] [ Tires Squeal ] [ Horn Honks ] - What happened ? Who the hell was that ? - One of the kidnappers . Look . He wants another two million in three hours . You 've got to get it . [ Panting ] Now you know who you can trust . Can we trust this guy ? How do we know we can trust this guy ? - We still have two hours left . - Oh , G - [ Jarod ] Exponential algorithms . Yeah . I used to try and solve those as a boy . It always took my mind someplace else . Hmm . Just like Patrick uses puzzles . [ Chuckles ] I never looked at it like that . We 're going to find him . He knew . He knew . He said it to me just before he hung up . He knew that Patrick was in special classes . He knew that he would be held after school late . But how did he know that he would be there alone ? [ Parker ] Must be someone in this godforsaken hospital who 's seen Jarod . - [ Parker ] Find anything ? - Bingo . [ Man ] Thanks a lot . Excuse me . Have you seen this man ? Jarod ? Sure . Just a sec . Yes . This is Dr. Hargadon . I need to page extension 7477 , please . It 's an emergency . [ Beeping ] [ Parker ] So , you knowJarod ? - Are you a friend ? - Old friend . He 's upstairs . I 'm headed that way . Come on . Jarod 's transfer came in today , but he still has , uh , one more patient . Well , it looks like he had the patient moved . This is dicey , Syd . If I know Jarod , he is right under my nose . [ Woman On P.A. , Indistinct ] [ Monitors Beeping ] Well , a swing and a miss . Sam , sweep the other floors , then meet me downstairs . - Yes , Miss Parker . - Broots , Sydney , come with me . Psst . [ Exhales ] - Thank you . - You obviously got my page . Thank you for helping me keep my work a secret . Wait a minute . - You 're the one that got Dr. Mitchell to confess ? - Yes . I 'm sorry I had to lie to you before . But I knew the pharmaceutical companies would send their lawyers after me . Lawyers ! Well , that explains that woman 's attitude problem . We 're not leaving . Check the employee records , Broots . - Find out where they were sending Jarod 's checks . - Okay . - His last patient was transferred . - It 's too neat , Syd . Your boy usually thumbs his nose at me . [ Angrily ] Could you go ? Egghead 's still in town . I got a gut feeling . " Dear Parents , In an effort to ease congestion ... " while the city completes roadwork near the school ... " pickup for the students will be moved from the south end of the school ... " to the north on Tuesday the 17 th . Sincerely , Martin Benton . " [ Jarod 's Voice On Radio ] Why don 't you take the van ? Hey ! Hey ! Don 't ! Don 't ! Hey ! No ! No ! Help ! Don 't ! Hey ! Don 't ! - [ Slams Into Wall ] - Hey , hey . Get me - Get me outta this . Relax . You 're being kidnapped , just like my son . - Harper ? - How much is he paying you ? How much is my son 's life worth ? Harper , please . Please get me outta here . It 's too early to beg . Kidnapping victims , they usually last 5.8 minutes before desperation sets in . [ Panting ] First , they have to face the overwhelming fear . - [ Shouts , Grunts ] - Like my son , you 're wondering , where 's he gonna take me ? - Is he going to kill me , or is he just going to torture me ? - Let me go . You 're begging again . You moved the student pickup to the north side of the school . But you made sure Patrick didn 't know about it . He was out there all alone . You supervised the kidnapping , didn 't you ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I have a surveillance video from where my son buys his comic books . Now you tell me . How much is he paying you ? A hundred thousand . - Where is Patrick ? - [ Whimpers ] He 'll kill me . No ! Oh . Not if I do it first . [ Shouting ] Where is he ? Money or no money , he 's gonna kill Patrick . Ow ! No ! Aah . Now where does that leave you now ? Where is he ? He 's in an abandoned warehouse . Across the street from the phone booth . - He was watching me . - Yes . Yes . [ Grunts ] - Jarod , what 's happening ? We got less than 30 minutes . - I know where Patrick is . - Where are you ? - At your place . - Has anyone been there looking for me ? - No . I 'll meet you there . - Manny . - Jarod , run ! Run . ! No . [ Grunts ] - Ow . - [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Grunts ] Miss Parker , there 's a little boy . He 's been kidnapped . He needs my help . - Won 't work this time . - [ Smashes Phone ] They 'll kill him ! - Let the authorities take care of it . - They don 't know about it ! - GetJarod to the car . - Sydney , please . - Please , don 't let this happen ! - [ Young Jarod Crying ] This is just how they stole me when I was a little boy ! Please ! [ Young Jarod Crying ] I wanna see my mommy ! Let me go ! - [ Parker ] It 's over . ! - [ Panting ] How do you face your past , Sydney ? [ Door Closes ] [ Sam ] Miss Parker . - I 'll take it from here . - Like hell you will . - You have a problem , talk to Mr. Raines . - Back off ! Don 't , Willie ! - [ Gunshot ] - Ow ! - [ Grunts ] - I 'm hit ! I 'm hit ! - Jarod , stop ! - Parker ! Please . [ Screams ] Ow ! [ Phone Rings ] [ Woman 's Voice ] We 're sorry . The mobile unit you have dialed is either - [ Beeps Off ] [ Kidnapper Speaking , Indistinct ] [ Both Grunting ] [ Choking ] Now - I 'm gonna kill your son . And you get to watch . Think you can handle that , Mr. Harper ? [ Young Jarod Screams ] [ Strained ] I 'm not ... Mr. Harper ! [ Grunting ] [ Shouting ] [ Shouts ] [ Coughing ] - [ Punches Landing ] - Mama , help me ! I am so proud of you . I 'm the proudest mommy in the world . [ Kidnapper Gasping ] [ Panting ] [ Wheezing ] [ Gasping ] It 's over , Patrick . It 's over . It 's over . [ Exhales ] [ Monitors Beep ] - Dad ! - Patrick , oh . Oh . [ Harper ] Let me look at you . [ Laughing , Crying ] - Oh . How are you , huh ? - I 'm good . [ Laughing ] Oh . [ Mouths Words ] [ Raines ] Unacceptable . Jarod escaped because of you , Miss Parker . Not at all . Parker caughtJarod . Willie botched it . That 's what my report will say . How do you think my father will react when he reads that ? This isn 't over . - [ Wheels Squeaking ] - You can bet your bald head on that . I can fight my own battles , Sydney . I knew you 'd do the right thing with Jarod . [ Exhales ] You know , Sydney ... sometimes I wonder if you do want him out there ... helping the little guy . I want him back as much as you do . I just don 't want him dead . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Those people who were looking for you , they think you 're pretty valuable . As far as I 'm concerned , you died in 1979 . [ Sighs ] Wow . Are you looking for this ? - That 's the piece ! - [ Chuckles ] [ Imitates Bugle Call ] - [ Harper ] Yea . ! - All right . [ Chuckles ] Looks like a perfect fit . Hey , you 'll make a great father someday . [ Chuckles ]

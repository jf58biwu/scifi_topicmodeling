 [ Whooshing ] ( Wade ) We 're on a jet . Yes ! First-class lounge of a 747 , to be exact . The timer has never landed us in the air before . Always on the ground . Let 's see ... Judging from what stars I can see and the coastline down there , we could still be in California . Hey , man , check out the food . I mean , good food . Well , enjoy ourselves while we 're here . ( Rembrandt ) This sure beats frozen fish sticks . You all right ? I 've got this thing about flying . Sliding between parallel worlds doesn 't bother you , but flying does ? You have no idea how much . Excuse me ! [ People chattering ] [ Clearing throat ] Just what I 'm looking for . Thank you . You guys together ? Uh , yeah , we 're traveling together . Hmm . I 'm going to the beach . Where are you guys going ? Beach sounds nice . Sun , surf , margaritas ! You 're a little out of shape for the Games , are you , Pops ? Well , it depends what sort of games you had in mind , doesn 't it , madam ? [ Laughs ] I don 't know about you guys , but after a month on Igloo World , I could use a vacation . Hear , hear . You want some more ginger ale ? Where did the stewardess go ? [ Crashing ] [ Woman screaming ] [ Woman sobbing ] Good heavens ! There 's no one flying the plane ! ( Professor ) Take the left seat , Mr. Mallory , and remember , dead foot , dead engine ! I 'll try and extinguish the fire ! Don 't back away from the stick , Mr. Mallory ! [ Woman screaming ] It 's not coming up ! You 're the pilot . It 's been engaged . Try again . [ Buzzing ] [ Buzzing ] ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year and you 're the same person but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice on speaker ) Welcome to Level 1 . While you 're grabbing some gear , just remember under the new rules of the Game adopted by the National League only one team or surviving player will be declared a winner . Come on . We 'll be starting the Game in approximately 19 seconds . What the devil is going on here ? ( Quinn ) It 's some kind of simulation . Well , I 've been simulated enough . I 'm getting out before this thing starts up . We 've got a full field of players for the Game . 25 teams in all representing the best competitors west of the Mississippi . There will be five levels to this tournament . Follow the signs to find your way through the city to the finish line . We believe that our diabolical digitheads have created a very bitchin ' course for this holiday bloodfest . To win the event , a player must place his medallion in the obelisk on Level 5 . We have a great assortment of booby traps heat-seeking androids , and mind-blowing mayhem , guaranteed to kill a few of you in a very entertaining fashion . And remember , anything you find or capture will admit you to a safe haven for a rest period . Just look for the big arch and sign that will lead you there . So let me conclude by saying that I , and 228 million fans out there , want to say we hope to see you at the beach ! How do we get to the beach ? Didn 't they tell you ? Well , perhaps we missed something . You make it to the finish line , and you 'll have enough money to go anywhere you want . The beach , the mountains . Name it . You better grab some gear . [ Sighing ] How many hours till we slide , Mr. Mallory ? 38 . Well , I say we just stay in the simulator . There 's enough food and drink in there to keep us happy . ( Egghead ) Looks like we 're in for a heat wave . Highs for today . ; 680 degrees . Who turned on the sauna ? Everybody grab something . ( Rembrandt ) What ? Anything you can ! Quick ! Run for the door ! ( Quinn ) The floor is heating up ! Hurry ! I don 't think I want to play this game . It doesn 't look like we have a choice . ( Wade ) Ow ! Ow ! [ Explosion rumbling ] What was that ? That was a bomb . This ranks very high on the weird meter . What kind of game is this ? I suspect a very serious one . Look , got a paper here , " It 's a good day to die . " That 's wonderful . What the hell ? Get down ! [ Gun firing ] Has anybody got a pen ? What ? You want to write a letter ? The pen is a mighty instrument . Okay ? [ Machine zipping ] [ Gun firing ] Well done , my boy . Nice neighborhood . I 'd hate to see the welcoming committee . Let 's get out of here before it arrives . ( Quinn ) We 're being watched . Hey ! There ' s been some kind of mistake , we want to quit . Where 's the exit ? I suspect our only way out is to find the finish line and complete the Game . [ Car approaching ] ( all ) Hey ! You guys , stop ! Gu ... Look , I suggest the only way we 're going to find out what kind of world we 've landed in is by keeping up with those people . ( Wade ) What is going on here ? ( Professor ) That is a car bomb . This game is being played for very high stakes . Mr. Brown ? Whoa ... whoa , guys , what 're you doing ? Well , if it 's a bomb , we 're gonna have to disarm it . What do you know about bombs ? Girl , in the Navy , you learn a lot about everything . Hey , Professor , what are the wires comin ' out of this coil ? That isn 't a coil , Mr. Brown . This is a diesel engine . They don 't have coils . How much time did you spend on that course ? Well , I took a couple of classes before I left on a U.S.O. Tour . Well , there are no suspicious connections to the battery , there 's nothing to the ignition . Nothin ' in here . Clean under here . Ah , right . [ Grunts ] I can 't be sure , but I think it 's okay . So , guys , why don 't you just step back , okay ? [ Panting ] [ Engine starting ] ( Rembrandt ) Let 's fly ! Let 's go . After them , Mr. Brown ! And don 't let them get away ! ( Wade ) It looks like a war zone . ( Quinn ) But who 're we fighting ? [ Explosion ] That is very close by . ( Rembrandt ) What did this ? Looks like somebody didn 't make it . Oh , my God . Hit the brakes . [ Beeping ] Back up ! Back up ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! [ Tires screeching ] Run for it ! [ Gun fire ] [ Groaning ] Professor , come on . Take it ! Come on ! Take it ! [ Panting ] Professor , you all right ? I can 't see anything . I can 't see anything , Mr. Mallory . [ Helicopter engine whirring ] I 'm blind . ( Egghead ) Congratulations , players . You are now on Level 2 . 18 teams remain in the game . [ Groaning ] [ Metallic clinking ] I need a change of guide dog . Well , if you 'd stay behind me you wouldn 't trip so much . Miss Wells , you 'd appreciate that having stumbled a dozen times my flesh , as well as my faith in your navigational skills , are damaged ! Look , why don 't I take over for now , okay ? That would be very good , Mr. Brown . Lead on . You think it 's permanent ? I don 't know . [ Panting ] Maybe it 's like a flash on a camera . It goes away . Wade , it 's been over three hours and he still can 't see . ( Quinn ) I wonder who invented this game ? ( Wade ) Some pretty sick puppies . Yeah . Well , maybe they got bored with the Super Bowl . Huh ? Psychiatrists say that the , uh , games we watch and play are a reflection of the collective national psyche . So what ? You don 't think they have little baseball players on this world ? If they do , I can assume the little sluggers use the bats on each other . [ Professor grunts ] [ Barking ] ( Quinn ) What is it ? Professor ! Come on ! Professor ! Come on ! Professor , it 's gone . It 's the biggest monster junkyard dog I 've ever seen . Let 's get out of here before it comes back . You all right ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Watch it . Watch it . Here . Come on , Frankie . Easy does it . Easy does it . I 'm gonna give you something for the pain . Okay ? Okay , Frankie ? You hear me , Frankie ? Don 't you think about going anywhere , all right ? You gotta stay with us . Wait . Who 's gonna teach me how to bodysurf ? Huh ? Oscar 's afraid of the water . That just leaves you . Frankie , Frankie , we can carry you to the finish line . We can do it . Remember the regionals ? Remember they counted us out . But we did anyway ! [ Panting ] Frankie ? [ Guns firing ] Frankie ? Frankie . [ Sobbing ] Frankie . What am I gonna tell your ... [ explosion rumbling ] I 'll make sure your family gets the money . You have my word . Hey . Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! I 'm surprised you made it this far . Is he dead ? Yes . If this were the last level , I 'd shoot you . But it 's not , and I play by the rules . Please . We 've got no fight with you . I 'm gonna lower my gun , all right ? Where are you going ? Wait . Please , let us come with you . Can 't do it . Well , at least tell us how to get out of here , then . Stay alive . You find a haven . That key will get you in . See you at the beach . What ? It means good luck . [ Engine starting ] Is that a dog ? Where ? ( Rembrandt ) It 's okay , Professor . It 's dead . And it 's not a dog . It 's an android . Yeah . Well , it could 've fooled me . It 's got some kind of control collar . You know what they say , " let sleeping droids lie . " ( Wade ) Try the key she gave us . It worked . ( Egghead ) Hello , players . Welcome to a haven . You 'll find food , water , and ammunition . You 're one of 16 teams left in the Game . And congratulations to all our players . This is one of the highest-rated Games in history . The fans love you ! See you at the beach ! ( Wade ) Well , at least we eat . They think of everything , don 't they ? How long till we slide ? 22 hours , 15 minutes . [ Sighs ] I know it 's not up to your gourmet standards , but ... I don 't want anything . Professor , you have to eat ... I know what I want ! I want to lie down . Will somebody please , please , please ... There 's a place right over here , Professor . I 've had it with Candid Camera . I mean , what kind of world gets off on seeing people hurt , huh ? Be glad we 're only visiting . Right over here . Back . Back . If you need anything ... That 'll be fine . Thank you . Mr. Mallory , every teacher goes through life hoping just once he 'll have a student like you . I just wanted you to know that . Now go away . [ Watch alarm beeping ] The Professor 's gone . Get up ! The Professor 's gone . Look inside . Professor ! Professor ! ( Professor ) No need to shout . I thought you were ... What the hell are you doin ' out here ? If you want to know , I was answering a call of nature . Why ... why didn 't you ask one of us for help ? You could 've gotten yourself killed ! This may come as a surprise to you , Mr. Mallory , but I am not yet comfortable with making my private hygiene a public event . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Save me further embarrassment by locating my right shoe . [ Gun firing ] Come on . You got it ? Uh-oh , we got company . ( Rembrandt ) I don 't know where this door goes , but ... Try it ! Let 's go ! Oh , no ! [ Knocking on door ] ( Rembrandt ) Hey , it 's locked ! Rembrandt ! ( Quinn ) Rembrandt ! Rembrandt ! Wait ! ( Rembrandt ) What do we do ? All right ! Find your way out . Follow the signs to the finish line . Signal us by firing three shots . We 'll meet you later ! [ Guns firing ] Why don 't we rest here for a while ? Hey , look ! Must be left over from a long time ago . I used to be pretty good at this . I was undefeated until the second grade , when I lost to Rosemary Caraway . Would you know it , the only boy I had a crush on quit playing dodge ball and came to watch . Norm Roberts . Oh , he was so cute . Wade . Truth is , I messed up . I got so worried about impressing him that I stepped on a line . Strictly an amateur move . ( Quinn ) Stay where you are ! Do not move ! You might set it off . Set what off ? Look over your shoulder . Quinn . All right . If it hasn 't gone off yet , it 's got to be triggered by your weight . You must not move . How much do you weigh ? What ? I need to put enough weight on the trigger pad so , it thinks that you 're still standing on it . How much do you weigh ? 100 pounds . OK , maybe 104 . I had a lot of pizza last week . [ Thumping ] So , uh , what happened to Norm ? Uh , I think he became an attorney . Figures . Quinn ? You 'd tell me if you thought I looked big , right ? Sure . No , I mean it . I mean , I-I 'd tell you if you had spinach in your teeth or bad breath . Friends do that , right ? If I was ... Wade , I think you need to be quiet now . Okay . Okay . When I tell you to , step off . Then what ? Then we run like a couple of bats out of hell . Okay . Okay . And ... jump ! [ Explosion ] [ Both panting ] So , how 's my breath ? [ Laughing ] [ Paper rustling ] I got some crackers here . Least they look like crackers . You want one ? What I want is for you to ... Yeah . Yeah . I know what you want . You can keep asking . Don 't be an idiot , Mr. Brown . Save yourself , man . Then , if there 's time , come back for me . Look , it 's not gonna happen . I 'm not leaving you . Mr. Brown , you and I have both served in our country 's armed forces . We know there 're times on certain missions where you have to be prepared to leave a wounded man behind ! Keep your voice down . What is the point of traveling to new worlds when you can 't see them ? All right , it 's simple . We 'll be your radio . What ? Wade , Quinn and me , we 'll tell you what we see . Mr. Brown , I don 't need a talking guide dog . I need a friend who will carry out my wishes . You don 't know you 're blind . You might see again . And even if you don 't , it doesn 't mean that your life is over . You know , one of my buddies in the Navy , Guy Yaniger , he always wanted to study painting in Paris . He saved all his life . When he retired , he had a lot of money . But he went blind from diabetes . What is the point of this maudlin little story ? He went to Paris , anyway , and became a sculptor . You know somethin ' ? For somebody with so much education , there are moments when you aren 't very smart at all . Spare me your insights , sir ! No , I figure that this is the first time in your life that you may have to depend on somebody else . And I can 't believe that you would rather die than do that . Man , don 't you know that we need your help , too ? Very well . Since you will not leave me , sir , I will leave you . I wouldn 't do that , Professor . [ Professor grunts ] [ Groans ] [ Screaming ] [ Sobbing ] You 're right , Mr. Brown . I do not want to do this . Don 't just stand there , man . Come and help me . Please ? ( Wade ) Rembrandt ! Professor ! Why don 't you signal again ? [ Firing ] What are we gonna do if ... We 'll find them . We will . Let 's just rest here for a while . [ Sighs ] How long before we slide ? 18 hours . Quinn ? What are we gonna do if we don 't hook up with them in time ? We 're not leaving without them . All right ? All right . Maybe we can rest in here . You 're certain that door 's secure ? Now , don 't worry . Nobody 's gettin ' in . What 's that humming noise ? I don 't hear anything . I 'm sorry . It 's up there , Mr. Brown . Okay , you wait right here . [ Gun clicking ] That way . Up there . Up there . [ Whirring ] What ? What happened ? What 's happening ? I 'm stuck on something . Take out the flashlight out of your bag . Shine it over here . Not in my eyes . Shine it up so I can see what 's got me . Slowly . [ Rembrandt grunts ] Up a little . Damn . What ? ( Rembrandt ) It 's not good . Okay , you got your gun handy ? Yes . Okay . You 're gonna have to take your gun and shoot the three big spiders that are coming to electrocute me . What ? No , really . You 're gonna have to kill these suckers . Mr. Brown , what if I shoot you ? I may ask you to do that if you miss too many times , okay ? All right . Just take the flashlight with the barrel of the gun . Shine it up . Up . There . That 's it ! Shoot ! You got him . We can do this . We can do this . Now , turn it to your ... to your to your left , okay ? Easy . Left . That 's it . Now ! No ! No ! No ! He 's going down . Bring it down ! Shoot ! You just poked him ! Shoot ! Okay . One more . Bring it over to your right . That 's it . Go a little further . Hold it right there . Right there . Let that little sucker come right to you . Yeah . Right there . That 's it . Easy . Shoot ! [ Rembrandt groans ] [ Yells ] Mr. Brown ? Rembrandt ? You all right ? Yeah , you got them . You got them all . ( Egghead ) Well done , players . You 're free to move to Level 4 . It only gets worse from here . There are 12 teams left in the Game . Can I ask you something ? I have a feeling no matter what I say , you 're still gonna ask . What were you thinking when we all thought that that plane was gonna crash ? I was thinking I was gonna die . I was thinking just when I was beginning to enjoy this ride , it was gonna be over and I was sad because I knew I 'd miss everybody . And then , I turned and saw you . And Arturo , and Remmy , and I was suddenly okay because at that moment I realized that everything we 've done , all the stuff we 've seen , it doesn 't just disappear . It goes somewhere . [ Whirring ] This way . Look ! I thought you ... [ panting ] We were on the verge of a civil war 10 years ago . The government had banned all sporting events but the people wanted to be entertained . You know ? So they started up the Games . They used to have the Game at the old coliseum but it outgrew in a couple of years . After the riots , the government banned all sports , except for the Game . In ' 92 , the owners built this wall around part of the city . After that , anybody with enough money could sponsor a team . How many times have you done this ? This is the first Game I 've gone major . This is our first time , too . Man , talk about ... What ... what did you call it ? Sliding . Talk about sliding into the wrong place at the wrong time . How did you get together ? Well , Wade , Arturo and I were conducting an experiment and Rembrandt just happened to be driving by outside and accidentally got sucked into the vortex . I didn 't think you guys looked like players . Especially the big guy . Is he dead ? We don 't know . I lost the last of my team yesterday . I 'm sorry . But as long as one of us makes it to the finish line , all our families get to share the prize money . How much do you win ? $ 5 million . You take the first watch ? Yeah . ( Rembrandt ) Damn ! What ? [ Growling ] We 're trapped ! How many ? Two too many . Get over here ! [ Dog barking ] Put this in front of you . Right there . [ Barking continues ] Come on ! [ Grunting ] ( Professor ) Where is it ? [ Grunts ] It 's all right ! It 's okay , Professor . Let 's get out of here . Let 's get our guns . Huh ? I came to relieve you . Good . It 's gonna be dawn soon . Would you change my bandage ? Yeah . How much time is left ? About two hours . Will you and your girlfriend leave without the other two ? We 're just friends . That 's all . How long will you wait for them ? If we don 't slide out of here before the timer runs out , we 're stuck here for 29 years . Today will be the worst . The last level . No rules . Anything goes . I was wondering ... Maybe we should team up . That way we can all make it to the finish line . I 'd like that . If I don 't make it to the finish line , will you place my medallion in the recorder ? You have my word . ( Egghead ) Congratulations , players . You 've made it to Level 5 . You 're in the home stretch . This looks to be an exciting finish ! Three teams are within one-half mile of the finish line . [ Gun firing ] [ Yelling ] ( Egghead ) Correction . Make that two teams . [ Gun firing ] Did you hear that ? Must be Quinn . Signal him back . [ Gun firing three times ] It 's them . Remmy ! Over here ! Come on , let 's go . Back ! Back . Back . Thank you , Remmy ! Mr. Brown , what can I do ? Left , shoot left . [ Gun firing ] ( Professor ) Mr. Brown , I believe my sight is returning . Stop talking and keep shooting ! Shoot ! Over there ! Down ! Thank you . We did good ! We did good ! Come on . Oh , am I glad to see you ! Ditto . How 's Quinn ? He 's fine . No ! Looks like I don 't get to finish . Isn 't that the girl that ... Take this for me . No . No . No . We 're gonna get you to a doctor . See you at the beach . No ! No ! No ! ( Egghead ) Congratulations , players ! You 're within 100 yards of winning . Be careful . All right , we have got two minutes left . There 's something I 've gotta do before we slide . No , you can 't risk it . Wade , I promised her . Hey , let me help you . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Mr. Brown , is this a CO2 extinguisher ? Does it still have anything in it ? I believe the androids locate us with a heat sensor . You could use the cold CO2 to create a cloud that would render you invisible to them . Remmy ? I 'm with you , man . Let 's do it . Okay ? Ready . Let 's go . ( Rembrandt ) Hurry up , Q-Ball . This thing 's running low ! Hey , you can 't do that . Watch me . ( Egghead ) The Game is officially over . A winner has been declared . Congratulations to Nicky Kent and her victorious team ! Let 's get out of here . The vortex . I can see the vortex ! I think my eyesight 's returning . All right . After you , Professor . Glad we all could make it . Ditto . [ Whooshing ]

 Here 's your mail . Oh . Thank you . Oh , and , Dr. Solomon , the Andrew K. And Eileen B. Fleischman foundation called . They received your grant application . Oh , excellent ! Dick , the Andrew K. And Eileen B. Fleischman foundation grant is very prestigious . Do you really think you have a chance ? Oh , it 's in the bag . Once I dazzle them with my scientific prowess , they 'll hand over that $ 20,000 and then , pffft ! I 'm off to Disney world , baby ! That money is for scientific research . Oh , you 're right . I should probably hit epcot while I 'm down there . " Dear friend , this is a chain letter . " You have 3 days to send copies of this to 10 of your friends , " but do not throw it away , " or bad luck will befall you . Sincerely- - " Mary , what is this ? I got one , too . Bunch of crap . Just throw it out . Whoa ! You are crazy . My aunt Janelle threw a chain letter out once . The same day , she crushed her hand in a juicer . I don 't understand . What kind of power could this letter have ? The power to waste your time . Why risk it , Dr. Solomon ? Just send it out . Every culture has its own superstition . I have studied ' em all . And the one thing they all have in common- - they 're all a little bit cuckoo ... cuckoo ... cuckoo . Mary : cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! Well , Nina , I hope that your aunt now realizes that the plastic plunger included with the juicer is there for a reason . [ Crash ] Mary : ow ! Pull the plug ! Pull the plug ! Oh , Mary , are you all right ? I told you not to throw that chain letter out ! Oh , don 't be ridiculous . It was just a coincidence . Ow ! Ooh ! Ah ! Ohh ! Unnhh ! hey , guys . Well , I finally figured out why Dubcek gave me such a deal on the garage apartment . Look at all this junk I found in my toilet tank . Oh , no , no . I think that junk 's supposed to be in there . It 's like your toilet 's brain . Or heart . Whoopsie . Well , I guess we better go down to elberfeld 's hardware store on main street . Hey , you know , they give out free peppermints . Whoo ! Not anymore . Ever since that new hardware stop superstore opened out by the interstate , they went out of business . Old man elberfeld died a lonely , broken man . [ Gasps ] There 's a new hardware stop by the interstate ? Awesome ! Let 's go ! Family meeting , family meeting ! Ok , can any of you come up with a reasonable scenario in which throwing out a piece of mail would result in having your ribs broken by a floor waxer ? Absolutely . The guy who was waxing the floor thought you were throwing out his paycheck . No . The guy with the waxer knew nothing about it . Well , why were you throwing out his paycheck ? No . There was no paycheck . No paycheck ? Well , no wonder the waxer dude went psycho on you . No ! No , no ! It 's called a chain letter . It 's a random , meaningless piece of mail , but Nina seems to think that throwing it away can cause bad luck . Oh , please . That 's stupid . There 's like a billion-to-one chance that those 2 things are at all related . Thank you . Yeah , just like there 's a billion-to-one chance that aliens from a distant galaxy would actually visit ... this crappy little planet . That 's true . Ohh . Hello , hello . Donny boy ! I just came by to pick up Tommy for the hockey game . Hockey game ? Yeah . Remember those season tickets for the Rutherford ice hogs that you begged me to order back when we were dating ? No . Well , they came . Yep , 63 home games . So I just figured I 'd treat Tommy and his lady to an evening of hockey . Yeah . It gives me a chance to show Alissa how varied my interests are . 'Cause every guy loves a good hockey game . Still trying to make up for the museum of miniatures , huh ? Desperately . So , Alissa , you know that big car that sweeps the ice ? That 's called the ice car . Isn 't that a Zamboni ? Yes . Yes , but Zamboni translated from Italian means car of the ice or ice car . Soda ! Who needs a soda ? ! I 'll be right back . I don 't know anything about hockey . I 'm a pathetic excuse for a man . Ahh , don 't worry . When the puck drops , sticks are gonna meet flesh , teeth are gonna fly , and blood will stain the ice . There will be so much testosterone wafting up to these seats , she 'll definitely mistake some of it for yours . That 's cool . Thank you . Oh . [ Puck drops ] Pass it ! Get a body on that guy ! Stenstrom ! Stenstrom ! What 's a Stenstrom ? Uh , number 23 . Olf Stenstrom . 161 stitches , 8 missing teeth , and 2 broken noses . The pretty boy of hockey . Shoot , you magnificent bastard ! Shoot it ! Is there anything I can help you with , miss ? Yeah . I think I need a new one of these . Let me take a look . Uh , you might need a new flex post . But your slide float 's fine . Oh , here 's your problem . Your center barrel is purging . Whoa . You 're like a plumbing expert . Well , I 've been here a while . I bet you could fix anything , huh ? Pretty much . Is that all you need ? Mm-hmm , yeah . Ok . No , uh ... wha-wha-wha-what do you know about , um , um , shelves ? Mounted brackets or built-ins ? Brackets . Ok . Why don 't you and I take a little walk down to aisle 15 , then we 'll hook past plumbing , and you 'll be all set . Ok . Hey , pal . Could I get 3 copies of this key ? You want me to make keys for you ? 3 . I need 3 copies . Ok . [ Engine humming ] It is not just for myself , but for all scientists that I accept the Andrew K. And Eileen B. Fleischman foundation grant . For I am but a humble player- - ahem , ahem , ahem- - a humble player in the amazing drama that is science . Hi , Dick . Mary , what happened to your arm ? Oh , it 's nothing . After they wrapped my ribs , the nurse walked me to my car and slammed my shoulder into the door . I guess accidents will happen , huh ? Yeah . She then took me back to the hospital , and they forced it back into its socket , gave me a shot of cortisone . Oh , well , I hope that made it feel better . Well , no . The cortisone was mismarked . It was minoxidil . But they tell me the excess hair will fall out by beach weather . Oh , don 't tell me you still have that chain letter . Well , it just so happens that I wrote a very important phone number on it . I don 't see any number . Well , I wrote it very small . Are we still on for the game tonight ? Sure , if you 're up to it . Oh , I 'm fine . Excuse me . How do you tell the difference between a 1 / 2 inch dowel and a 3 / 8 dowel ? You know , I 've been getting this a lot lately . There 's a standard rule of thumb . Ok , now , the 3 / 8 dowel fits perfectly in my ear . Whereas the 1 / 2 inch dowel does not . Ok , thanks . All right . All right , everybody , clear your desks . All you will need is your examination and a number 2 pencil . You will have exactly one hour- - Leon , clear your desk . Dr. Solomon , that 's my lucky rabbit 's foot . See , I really wanna do well on this test . And a severed foot of a lagomorphic mammal increases your chances of getting a good grade ? That 's what I 'm hoping for , yes . What about studying ? That works for most people . Not me . That 's why I got this . Just put it away . Well , what about bug ? He gets to wear his lucky Pendleton sweatshirt . I 'm not wearing this for the test , jerk . Pendleton has got a basketball game today , and the team always wins when I wear this . Dr. Solomon , what about our exam- - oh , shut up , Caryn . Now , bug , about your shirt- - does it work just for home games ? How many miles before it loses its power ? It 's not like that . Ok , you 're gonna jinx it now . You 're gonna jinx it . Stenstrom ! Stenstrom ! Did ya see that ? Now that is forechecking . Mm-hmm . And I 'm guessing that nobody forechecks quite like Stenstrom . Yeah , nobody . Sorry we 're late . My carburetor caught on fire . It was a tad strange . The car was turned off at the time . Wow , Mary . Looks like you 've had a string of bad luck . She did throw out a chain letter . Ooh , that 's bad news . Elbowing ! That 's elbowing ! Put him in the box , you blind idiot ! Would someone tell that annoying girl to keep it down ? She 's Tommy 's new girlfriend . She 's cute . Shoot it ! Shoot it ! Mary , look out ! Ohh ! I caught a puck ! I caught a puck ! That is so lucky . And I thought you had bad luck . Oh , ho ! You see , silly ? Oh , and I was so worried about this stupid letter . Look at this , Mary . I 'm tearing it up . So much for this one . Good riddance . I mean , what are the chances of Mary Albright catching a hockey puck ? [ Thud ] Oh , no . It 's the curse of the chain letter . This is the worst thing that 's ever happened to me . I 'm doomed ! Hey , Justin . Justin , look what 's broken . Oh , how did that happen ? I do not know . It must 've just disconnected itself or something . Looks like your gas line 's been cut with a hacksaw . Weird . You can fix it , though , right , Justin ? Got to open it up , look at the cores . Think you may need to rethread the t-valve ? Could be . I just hope I don 't have to recalibrate the flow bushings . Yeah , well , there 's a lot of silt collecting in the drip pan . Ooh . What are your btus ? 500 . I 'll be right back . I 'll be waiting . You know that song macho man ? Mm-hmm . He 's who they 're singing about . So I guess rugged good looks and broad shoulders really do it for you women . Oh , please . Lots of guys have that . But Justin- - Justin can fix things . He can build things . He 's got a belt full of tools . A tool belt , if you will . How am I supposed to compete with guys like that ? Look at me . My arms are stick-thin , I shave , like , once a month , my ass is flat . Sweetie , listen to me . Don 't be so hard on yourself , Ok ? I mean , I 'm sure there are a lot of girls who are more than willing to settle for a tiny , little wussy like you . That helped very little . This is a disaster . What am I gonna do ? I can feel the Andrew K. And Eileen B. Fleischman foundation grant slipping away ! I told you to send out that chain letter . Nina , some of my students have lucky charms . Do those work ? Ooh , it couldn 't hurt . Try to remember an item you had when something really great happened to you . Like the day I met Mary ? Yes , what did you have in your pocket the day you met her ? Lint . Lint ! My lucky lint ! Your lucky lint ? Oh , damn ! I let Harry play with it , and he lost it . Oh , listen to you two . Haven 't you ever heard of the machacan tribe ? Well , of course , but tell us for Nina 's sake . Machacan men believed that by wearing this sheath over their ... that by wearing this sheath , they would ward off all misfortune . Great . Can I wear it ? It didn 't work , Dick . They were wiped out by a volcano . Everything we know about them we have learned from their perfectly preserved- - from this sheath . Are there any volcanoes in Ohio ? No . Great . Then I 'll wear it . Give that to me . Oh , fine . Smells like hell , anyway . Look at her . She 's in love with Stenstrom . Aw , she 's just getting into the game . I love you , Stenstrom ! She 's about a goal away from taking her shirt off . Oh , don 't sweat it , Tommy . It 's just a harmless crush . Kinda like the one I used to have on Joe Namath . It 's not something I 'm proud of . But it 's not a harmless crush , Don . She 's crazy about him . He 's just more of a man than I am . Guys like us are always gonna lose out to guys like that . At least I can give ' em speeding tickets . Yeah , but what can I do ? That 's something you 're gonna have to figure out for yourself , Tommy . That 's part of what becoming a man is all about . You 're just saying that ' cause you don 't know how to help me . I 'm dry . Hello , hello , hello . What are you doing ? Nothing . I 'm in a run of bad luck , and I 'm not setting foot outside this house without a lucky charm . Yeah . Oh , really ? It 's impossible to find rabbit 's feet in this town . Oh , sure , you can get a whole rabbit , but don 't tell the pet store what you 're gonna do with it . Well , this came for you . The mailman accidentally left it in my bedroom . It 's from the Andrew K. And Eileen B. Fleischman foundation . I 've been chosen as a finalist for the Andrew K. And Eileen b . Fleischman foundation grant ! This must be your lucky day . And you ! What ? You 're my lucky charm ! Oh , Mrs. Dubcek . There you go . And thank you for shopping at the hardware stop , your one-stop spot to stop to shop spot . Hi . Can I help you ? I 'm looking for Justin . He 's not with another customer , is he ? Nope . Today 's his day off . Maybe I can help you ? No . Heh . No , no , no . Justin and I were gonna talk about customizing cabinets . My specialty . I was a carpenter for 10 years . You were ? Bonded and licensed . Bonded . No . No , I can 't . It wouldn 't be right . I 'll just wait for Justin , Ok ? Ok . I mean , it 's not like I don 't want to . It 's just I just don 't know where it 'll go , you know ? That 's fine . Oh , screw Justin . Let 's do it . Uh , excuse me . Where 's the lawn-And-garden department . You know what ? I have no idea . Let 's go find out , huh ? Wait a second . Don 't you work here ? No . Why would you think that ? You got the orange shirt . I- - hmm . What 's going on with that guy ? Take 5 . You 're fired . Hey . Hey , Stenstrom . Hmm ? Ok , look , I gotta talk to you . I 'm beggin ' you , man . Everybody knows that you 're big and you 're strong and so you could have any woman in this place , but I 'm just asking you , man to man , could you leave me my girlfriend ? Just that one . That 's all I ask . Just that one . [ Swedish accent ] Ice hogs number one . No . She really means a lot to me , man . Stay in school . Say no to drug . Ok , I 'm just gonna take a wild guess , say you don 't speak a word of English . Say no to drug . Tommy , what are you doing ? Ok , this is the last time I 'm gonna tell you here . Stay away from my girl . 'Cause otherwise , you 're gonna have to answer to me . You don 't want a piece of this . Capice ? Ok . What was that all about ? He was talking trash about you . I didn 't wanna get violent , but if I needed to , I would 've forechecked his butt into the Zamboni . Ow ! Such an idiot . Ok , let 's ease up there . Next . Dr. Solomon . Welcome . Thank you for having me . Please come in . Uh , yes , uh ... yes , of course . Are you Ok ? I 'm fine . We 've read your paper , and we 're quite excited to hear your presentation . Uh , thank you . And I 'm sure that a generous grant from , uh ... [ Clears throat ] Ok , I 'm coming . Who is this ? This is my esteemed colleague Dr. Mamie Dubcek . Lucky , lucky , lucky , lucky , lucky , lucky- - Dr. Solomon . Just one moment . Franks , beans , collard greens . Yes ? On page 13 of your proposal , you suggest the behavior of super- - I 'm sorry . I can 't answer any questions on that . You can 't ? I can 't answer any questions regarding page 13 or what I like to refer to as " the devil 's page . " So , uh , if you are all open to said page , I will just collect them and rid the room of their demonic mojo . Andrew K. And Eileen B. Fleischman foundation grant . Andrew K. And Eileen B. Fleischman foundation grant . Dr. Solomon ... yes ? Do you really think this is any way to impress a panel of scientists ? All signs point to yes . Ahh , well , I didn 't get the grant . Mmm . They didn 't like your ideas ? I never got to them . I was too busy yanking on Dubcek 's ears . It 's so weird . Humans make up all these superstitions to try to control random events , but before they know it , the superstitions are controlling them . And to think I fell for it . Yeah . Well , I feel pretty stupid , too . I thought Alissa was in love with Stenstrom just ' cause he 's big and rugged and likes to fight . Ooh , he sounds good . Hey , you guys . I 'm going down to the mall to buy some sneakers . well , the mystery is solved . It wasn 't bad luck . I have an inner-ear infection that threw off my balance . Oh , that 's good to know . The car place called . Your car will be ready tomorrow . Oh . What happened to your car ? Some kid hit the windshield with a rock . It was a meteorite . They don 't know that ! Nasa 's still studying it . Bad mojo . Bad mojo . Mm-Hmm . Mm-hmm .

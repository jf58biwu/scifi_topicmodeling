 [ Clacking ] [ Beeping ] [ Young Jarod ] Hi , Mom . Hi , Dad . I 'm so happy to see you again . Hello , Mother , Father . It 's very good to see you again . Sydney , I can 't decide what to say . - And this tie isn 't working . - Jarod ... just try and relax . Just please tell me what to say . Trust your feelings ... and you 'll be fine . [ Beeping ] [ Mr. Lyle ] So how much did the little thief get ? Sixty million , give or take . Considering what was sitting in the account ... Jarod could have hit us worse . You know , murder happens ... extortion is sometimes necessary ... but theft - simply taking for the taking - has always escaped me as an admirable criminal pursuit . Little bitter about your car being stolen ? Ten miles on the odometer . Three hours filling out police reports ... five pages of insurance company fine print - I know it 's a little late to stop the happy fellows at the chop shop this time ... but I saw this and I immediately thought of you . Consider it a little preventative medicine . Actually , with the $ 2,000 alarm system ... that the dealer all but threw in ... I still hope to get my car back in one piece . [ Jarod ] Now there 's a good target . Once you try one of these puppies ... you 'll never go back . It takes a lot of jack to supply the kind of order I 'm talking about . Who 's funding you ? Some people I used to work for . I 'm talking about 60 SAMs . If they can afford ' em , I can find ' em . You get ' em to my place in Venezuela , we 're in business . There 's no business like the arms business . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Sixty million dollars - What are you up to , Jarod ? Mmm . Actually , it 's 58,990,620 . It 's not every day we get ripped off to the exact penny . Once again , Officer , it 's a black ... 500 SL convertible ... license plate , LYLE-1 . Well , it didn 't just vanish . Found it . Thank you . Mm . Have a nice day . Jarod . How goes the hunt , Broots ? Well , Jarod 's routed the money through a maze of phony cover accounts - nearly 100 of them so far - but I 'm still tracking it . Look , I hate to bring the room down , but we 've been here before . It 'll take us three weeks to run Jarod 's little maze ... and by then he 'll be long gone . Not this time . Right , Broots ? I created a new computer tracing program - type of digital encryption . I marked the Centre 's funds electronically - like a bank marks cash - and this program lets me follow the money wherever it goes . [ Chuckles ] I , uh - I call it " The Hound . " Too bad it doesn 't work for cars though . Whoo-hoo ! Whoo-hoo ! Come on . You 're making me feel like McGwire . [ Grunts ] Whoo ! Three-bagger . Come on . Put some heat on that ball . [ Groans ] I 'm sorry , Mr. Blake . It slipped . Your turn . - [ Man Groans ] - [ Bat Clatters ] [ Man # 2 ] You all right ? I guess that one got away from you . Landed right where I threw it . Hmm . Just stack ' em four high . The missiles . All 60 of them . - I 'll have my man cut you a check . - Check ? What are you talking about ? That wasn 't part of the deal . I guess you should have covered that ... before you brought your weapons here . You know something , Mr. Blake ? In their current state they couldn 't take out a Tonka truck . The guidance systems are dead ... and I 've got the only brain that can program them . I guess you should have covered that before I brought them here . Cash - wired to my account . Half now , half when they can fly . Ryan , I 'm in a meeting here . - I 'm sorry , sir . - Ryan was just playing , Daddy . Tuck in that shirt . Oh . Yes , sir . - Emma . - Come on , kids . Your dad 's working . Let 's get ready for lunch . Your children are very well behaved . How long is it gonna take to program my missiles ? I 'll need to be here for two weeks . - You got 72 hours . - We 're talking about 60 missiles here . It would take an entire team of specialists ... to program those missiles in 72 hours . - I 'll give you Logan and Dobbs . - I don 't think you understand - No , I understand perfectly . You got 72 hours . You stay in the guest house . I want you here until those missiles are programmed . Seventy-two hours then . Guidance telemetry ... needs to be downloaded into each missile - one at a time . Which means we will be working shifts around the clock ... if we 're going to meet the deadline . [ Man ] Considering Mr. Blake already has buyers lined up ... there 's not much choice , is there ? I 'm going to get some air . Get started , Mr. Dobbs . [ Man On Radio ] Inter-perimeter clear . [ Clink ] You know , if you center the tail - like this - it flies a lot further . Thanks . Who are you ? I 'm working for your dad . [ Girl ] Do you know if " angel " is G-E-L or G-A-L ? - G-E-L . - Thanks . - Jarod . - I 'm Rebecca . - Hi , Rebecca . - Thanks , Jarod . What are you writing ? A letter ... to my mom . I write lots of them . - Your mom 's not here ? - No . She 's ... right here , see ? - She 's very pretty . - Don 't tell my dad about the picture . - I 'm not supposed to have it . - I promise . Our mom 's in heaven . She 's an angel . Thank you for your patience . It 's really been a madhouse here today . - [ Child ] Mommy , Mommy ! - It 's okay . Oh ! I am so sorry . I swear , that 's the fifth glass I 've dumped today . Spilling a glass of water isn 't the end of the world . Losing your children is . What do you know about my kids ? I know that you lost them ... and you won 't be alive until you get them back . Wendy , my name is Jarod . I heard about you ... and your story . I know you don 't have much reason to trust people right now ... but I would like to help you get your children back . Why would you help me ? Let 's just say I know the feeling . It 's been three years since - I don 't even know where they are . Not long after the court granted me custody ... my ex-husband stole Ryan and Rebecca . I have spent every last penny , every waking moment , searching ... and I 'm still without them . They could be anywhere in the world by now . Leave that to me . Desmond is a monster . When the judge granted me full custody ... Desmond was furious . I saw hatred in his eyes like I have never seen . You 're talking about going after his number one possession . And that is exactly how he sees our children , as a possession . - He sounds like a real family man . - He wasn 't always like that . Now ... he would kill ... to keep me away from our children . Wendy . Let me help you . Who are you ? I 'm someone ... who believes that children shouldn 't be stolen ... from a mother who loves them . [ Rebecca ] We miss our mom . She died three years ago ... in a car crash . Jarod , there 's been an accident . The plane your parents were on - it crashed . There were no survivors . [ Emma ] Ryan , Rebecca , in the house . Come on , in the house . I don 't know what your business with Mr. Blake is ... but from now on , you stay away from those kids . Those children are lucky to have someone like you watching out for them . - [ Whirring , Beeping ] - [ Keys Clacking ] [ Dobbs ] See you in 60 . [ Woman Speaking Spanish On P.A. ] [ Jarod ] Wendy . Oh , Jarod . I got here as quickly as I could . Just , uh-Just tell me that my children are okay . - They 're fine . - [ Sighs ] Thank goodness . When I got your messages saying to come as soon as possible ... I didn 't know what to think . I didn 't expect to hear from you for at least a week . I had to push the timetable up . Desmond has only given me 72 hours . - Is that enough time ? - [ Sighs ] It 'll have to be . Just tell me that you are sure that Ryan and Rebecca are okay . See for yourself . I took this yesterday . - I never thought I 'd see ' em again . - You will . - They ride horses . - [ Jarod ] Lessons every day at 5.00 . Unfortunately , Desmond is always with them along with his armed guard . - Well , how are we gonna save ' em ? This is a layout of your ex-husband 's compound . Ryan and Rebecca 's rooms are in the main house . I 'm working on circumventing the security cameras and the alarm system ... so that I have free access inside the house . Once I 've accomplished that ... then we 'll make our move . You 'll be waiting in a car outside of this gate . When ? Before my cover with Desmond is blown . - Soon . Very soon . - [ Sighs ] Oh , I hope we 're doing the right thing . It 's just , uh ... hard for me to even imagine being with them again . Trust your feelings . You 'll do just fine . [ Sighs ] There 's something you have to know . Desmond told your children ... that you died in a car crash . I just - I don 't know if I 'm gonna make it through this . Wendy , you can 't fall apart on me now . It may be a shock for them at first ... but your children need you . They need a mother . Trust me . - I have to get back to the compound . - Oh . Jarod - Oh , just thank you . - [ Chuckles ] - Thank you . You can thank me when you 're back with your children . The Hound did it . Gee , Broots , come on in . It found the money thatJarod stole . He routed it through 506 bogus accounts ... and it ended up here . " Raul Zenega - real estate developer ... - Mexico City . " - That may be what it says ... but Mr. Zenega 's an arms dealer . And you know this because ? Let 's just say he and I have a history together - back when I was still building my résumé . What would Jarod be doing with 60 million dollars ' worth of weapons ? Sounds like a question for your pal Zenega . So what happened to your pitcher ? Disabled list . You wanted to see me ? About a month ago , someone tried to blow up my car . Luckily I wasn 't in it ... but lately ... I 've been a little mistrustful of strangers . I went by your room last night . You weren 't in it . - I didn 't realize I had a curfew . - My house , my rules . I went for a walk . And I 'm supposed to believe that ? Look , Mr. Desmond , I 'm not here to blow up your car . I 'm here to program your missiles , get my money ... and get the hell out of here . - [ Fence Rattles ] - [ Mutters Angrily ] [ Dobbs ] Twenty-three down . Great . Thirty-seven more to go . [ Beeping ] - [ Jarod ] Damn it . - What was that ? - Must have blown a circuit . - I 'll go reset it . No , I 'll go . Get that casing fitted . [ Man Over Radio ] Rear gate secure . [ Radio Chatter , Indistinct ] What do you think you 're doing ? I was hungry , so I thought I would grab a sandwich . Well , I 'm afraid that this area is off-limits . Well , the old stomach was growling . What can you do ? That 's a very pretty medallion you 're wearing . - What saint is it ? - I don 't know . It was a gift . And now I have to insist that you leave . I don 't allow Mr. Blake 's associates in this part of the house . Tell me something , Emma . If you have such a problem with Mr. Blake 's associates ... why do you work for him ? It 's really none of your concern . It must be very difficult to fill her shoes . One doesn 't replace a mother . I 'm sure ... wherever she is ... she 's very grateful to you . [ Panting ] [ Miss Parker ] Mmm . Work those quads . You must be Raul Zenega . Ay . A beautiful young lady has caught me at a disadvantage . - Please don 't get up . - [ Laughs ] [ Mr. Lyle ] Hola , Raul . - [ Groans ] - Little out of shape , are we ? Please . Whatever you want , I 'll give it to you . Anything . - [ Groans ] - You obviously made quite an impression last time you met . But to my credit ... very little scarring . My legs , my legs . I can 't hold it . [ Groans ] Psst . This man gave you ... sixty million dollars of our money . I 'd like to know what he got in return . Missile launchers - laser-guided SAMs . Sixty of them . - [ Squealing ] - [ Groans ] Twenty-second time-out , Raul . Where 'd he take them ? All I know is the name ofhis buyer . It 's Desmond Blake . Tell us where to find Blake ... and you keep your knees . I would never lie to you . I swear . Not after last time . [ Groaning ] - [ Groaning ] - Gravity 's a bitch . - [ Knocking ] - Wendy ? Wendy ? Wendy ! Wendy . Oh , no . The riding school . Good form , Ryan . Keep working on it . [ Chattering , Indistinct ] That 's not bad , Son . You 're getting better . You 're getting better . - [ Ryan ] Where 's my plane ? - I think it 's over there . Hi , Daddy . How am I doing ? Pull your horse in a bit . Straighten your back , hands higher . That 's it . Come on . Come on . Don 't give me that look . The only reason I tell you what you 're doing wrong ... is so you can do it better next time . - [ Radio Playing ] - [ Woman Speaking Spanish ] Ryan ! Ryan ! Ryan ! - Bring it ! - I think I saw a lady . I think it was Mom . Let 's go . Let 's go . In the car . In the car . Everyone . Everybody , get in the car . Son , get in the car ! Let 's go . Let 's go . Beat it . Go ! - [ Horn Honking ] - [ Blake ] Emma ! Emma ! But it was Mom . I saw her . Ryan , you did not see your mother . It 's impossible . - Inside , both of you ! - But what if he 's right ? Maybe it was all a mistake . Maybe she wasn 't even in the car that crashed . She could still be alive . - What if my parents weren 't even on that plane ? - Jarod ... denial is a very ... human response to a devastating loss ... but this is a reality that must be faced ... no matter how painful that may be . [ Blake ] Did I tell you ? I said inside the house , both of you , now . But , Dad , if Mom 's still alive , she 's gotta be looking for us . It was her . She looks just like she did in Rebecca 's picture . What picture ? Give me that picture , young lady . I said give me that book . Why ? Why do you kids do this to me ? Do you know how difficult it was losing your mother ? How it tears me up inside ... to see her face ? - But , Dad , if it was Mom - - Your mother is dead ! This does nothing but cause me pain . Ryan , maybe the reason ... that you saw your mom is because you miss her so much . Your heart wants to see her so badly ... that your eyes went along with it . Emma , get these two packed . We 're leaving first thing in the morning . - Leaving for how long ? - I said get them packed ! Come on . - Come on . - The morning ? Are you crazy ? There 's no way I can have the missiles done by the morning . And I want to know what you were doing out by the stables . I was trying to tell you that we 're running behind . Dobbs and Logan aren 't cutting it . No , they 're cutting it . It 's you who I 'm concerned about . I 'm thinking it may be time to just blow your brains out . I 'm the only one that knows where the memory chips are . You need me . Unless , of course , you don 't want your missiles . Jarod , I 've got a brain too ... and it 's telling me not to trust you . - [ Jarod ] What were you thinking ? - I wanted to see them . - [ Jarod ] What were you thinking ? - I wanted to see them . I was just losing my mind knowing that they were just a few blocks away . Well , now Desmond is spooked . He 's taking the kids and flying out first thing in the morning . - What ? Where are they going ? - He wouldn 't tell me . I have to get them out tonight . You park the car by the gate at 11 : 00 p.m. , like we had planned ... and you sit there with the lights off and you wait . - Can we trust Emma ? - Absolutely . All right . I will create some kind of diversion . Then I will get the children out . In the meantime , don 't go out that door ... and don 't so much as peek out those windows . Desmond 's men will be looking for you . Ryan didn 't even recognize me . [ Sighs ] Of course he did . It 's all he could think about . Rebecca too . She carried this with her all along . 11 : 00 p.m. Sharp . Wendy , I 'll get them out . I promise . [ Broots ] The name Raul Zenega gave you ? Desmond Blake ? - I think I found him . - You think . Remember the Centre account thatJarod stole the 60 million from ? It just received a very serious deposit a wire for 40 million bucks . - Where did it come from ? Jarod 's buyer - Desmond Blake - from a small town in Venezuela . I hope you brought your sunscreen . [ Men Chattering ] Emma . I need to speak to you . - There 's not much time . - Time for what ? Time to get Rebecca and Ryan out of here and into their mother 's arms . What are you talking about ? Do I have to remind you that Wendy Dawson died three years ago ? That is what Desmond always wanted you to believe ... but I am telling you , she 's very much alive ... and in a hotel not ten minutes from here . You know what ? I don 't believe you . [ Sighs ] That medallion around your neck - It 's a St. Anne 's medal . Wendy gave it to you the day her son was born ... to thank you for being like a sister to her . [ Scoffs ] Desmond could have told you that one . When you put it around your neck , she made you promise ... that if anything ever happened to her children ... you would devote your life to raising them . Desmond couldn 't have told me that . He wasn 't even there that day his son was born . Oh , my God , Wendy . But I saw the casket go into the grave . You never saw inside the casket , did you ? I was - I was in New York when Desmond called me ... about the news that Wendy had died . And I 'd been divorced for a couple of months ... and he said that the kids needed me desperately , so I flew here straightaway . She was buried the next day . Wendy had no other family , so - [ Laughs ] Desmond said that he wanted to bury her here ... so that the kids could be close to her . What lie have I been part of ? Be a part of the truth . Help me . Help those children . Come on . [ Beeping ] Call the general now - and get someone to put this out . [ Clamoring ] - [ Beeping ] - [ Whirring ] Ryan . - [ Beeping ] - [ Whirring ] Rebecca . Rebecca ! - Where are they ? Where are the children ? - I don 't know . [ Phone Ringing ] - Jarod ? - The plan has changed , Wendy . Get out of there . Go . - Wh-Where are the children ? - They 're gone . Desmond took your children to another part of the compound ... but they 're okay . Because he saw me at the riding stables . [ Groans ] - I can 't risk anything happening to the children . - Nothing will , I promise you . You don 't know Desmond . He 'll do anything to keep them away from me . - I mean , anything . - Wendy , calm down . Now listen to me . Go to the airport and park at the south end of the hangar and wait . - This is a mistake . - I was stolen from my mother when I was a child . I never wanted her to stop looking for me ... even if it put me in danger . Wendy , never give up . The children need you . [ Sighs ] I 'll get them out . [ Electronic Whine ] [ Beeping ] Here you go , Dawkins . - The SAMs are loaded and ready to go . - That 's great . It 's been a rough couple of days . Keeping a family together can be very difficult . - Mr. Blake ? - Hmm ? There 's been a problem . Dawkins is feeling really ill . - Who 's Dawkins ? - He 's my driver . I could drive you . Hey , it 's the least I can do for a paying customer . What the hell . An iron gate 's not gonna save you this time , Jarod . [ Blake ] What 's the problem ? Let 's go . Emma , aren 't those two parked over there the ones ... that were questioning you about the children when you were in town ? - Uh , yeah , yeah . That 's them . - What questions ? I should have mentioned it to you earlier ... but I , uh - I didn 't want to bother you . They just seemed really interested ... in Ryan and Rebecca , that 's all . I told them nothing , of course . We 've got a couple of trespassers at the gate . Make sure they don 't give us any trouble or follow us . Then you can let them go . - He 's gotta come out sometime . - I got a bad feeling . Move it ! Go ! Go ! [ Blake ] Okay , kids , let 's go . Come on , let 's shake . [ Beeps ] Unlock the door . Hey . What the hell are you doing ? Just making sure I have a captive audience . Oh , Desmond , I hope you don 't mind ... but I sent one of those ahead . - I thought I would do a little target practice . - [ Electronic Whine ] Wait till Logan and Dobbs get here . You 're a dead man . The key word being " when . " [ Chuckles ] [ Groans ] Oh , man . You have wonderful taste in weapons , Desmond . Who the hell are you ? Why are you doing this , Jarod ? So you would know what it feels like ... to have everything that you care about in the world ... ripped away from you - Like you did to your ex-wife . Like you did to Ryan and Rebecca . My kids ? What do my kids have to do with this ? Oh , they have everything to do with this . - I know what 's best for them . - Oh , really ? Like telling them that the one person that they love in the world is dead ? That woman doesn 't deserve them . They 're mine ! You make it sound like having children is like owning - well , a missile . - [ Panting ] - [ Whirring ] No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! You know , on second thought ... blowing you up is too easy . I 've got something ... that will get you where you live . Emma , bring the children . [ Blake ] What the hell 's going on , Jarod ? What are you doing ? - Ryan . Rebecca . - I have someone here who has missed you very much - who loves you more than everything in the whole world . Don 't be afraid . Just trust your heart . Oh , Wendy . No ! No ! No ! No , don 't listen ! No ! - Come on ! - [ Ryan ] Mommy ! - I can 't believe it . - [ Rebecca ] We missed you . - You 're actually here . - [ Blake ] Wendy ! Wendy , don 't ! Mom , oh ! Oh , my God . [ Wendy ] Oh , look at you . Emma ! Thank you so much . Get on the plane . [ Blake ] Rebecca ! Ryan ! [ Jarod ] Oh , Desmond . You know ... the Venezuelan authorities were very interested ... when I told them that arms dealing was going on right under their very noses . - You son of a bitch . - They 'll be here within the hour . F.Y. I. - All this time I haven 't been arming your missiles . I 've been disarming them . Now they couldn 't take out a Tonka truck . Rebecca ! Ryan ! Rebecca ! You 're my kids ! Come on . Let 's go . Jarod ! You - [ Laughing ] You 've given me my life back . Take good care of them . - Let them take care of you . - I will . Oh . Here 's a little something to get your new life started - from Desmond . From Desmond ? Well , I helped out a little bit . Oh ! Oh , my gosh . - Good luck . - Jarod . I hope your parents find you one day ... so that you can feel what I 'm feeling right now . Thanks . Thank you . - [ Whispering ] Bye . - Bye . [ Young Jarod ] Dear Mom . I miss you more than ever . [ Thinking ] Every day I think of you . I make myself remember your face ... and Dad 's face . I remember everything I can ... so I 'll know you when we see each other again .

 Charlie ! Come on , Charlie . Here you go , sweetie . Charlie ? Hey , ice cream ! Oh . You want some ice cream ? Here , Charlie . Here you go . Look ! There it goes . Going to balloon land . Go bye-bye . Shh . Oh , sweetie , don 't cry . Look , here 's some ice cream . Want some ice cream ? Teddy ? Teddy , here 's your balloon . Look at that . Such a mess . We got to clean you up . Charlie and I will wait for you . That was my balloon . - Eat your ice cream before it melts . - I don 't want any ice cream . I want my balloon . We 'll get you a balloon , okay ? No . I want my balloon . Fine . We 'll get you another balloon . That was a waste of good money . Ooh ! There we go . Okay . Okay , oh ! There we go . That 's a boy . Such a good boy . Okay . Okay , Teddy . I 'll be right back , okay ? # There were six in a bed and the little one said " Roll over , roll over " # # So they all rolled over and one fell out # # Five in the bed and the little one said " Roll over , roll over " # # So they all rolled over and one fell out # # Four in the bed and the little one said " Roll over , roll over " # # So they all rolled over and one fell out # # Three in the bed and the little one said " Roll over , roll over " # # So they all rolled over and one fell out # # Two in the bed and the little one said ... # # Teddy ? Teddy ! Teddy ! Teddy ! Teddy ! Ready ? There 's a kid on the track ! Oh , my God ! Teddy ! Teddy , get away from there ! Teddy ! Get off the track ! No ! Oh , my God ! Teddy ? Oh , Maggie . Teddy . This photo was taken at an amusement park three months ago . The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey , age two . - He was killed just seconds after this was taken . - How ? According to the police report , he wandered onto the tracks of the miniature train . The conductor was unable to stop due to a malfunction of the braking system . Teddy 's father works for the State Department , so a coroner 's inquest was held ... due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the accident . And did the inquest come up with anything unusual ? No . But the county medical examiner called me afterwards . He was disturbed by this case and by this photograph . And I think with good reason . This is a helium balloon . And one thing I did learn in kindergarten is when you let them go , they float up , up and away , but this is moving away from him horizontally . Did you learn about wind in kindergarten ? I called the National Weather Service , and they said ... on the day Teddy died the wind was blowing north , but you see , the balloon is moving south , as if it 's being pulled against the wind . Pulled ? By whom ? I don 't know . That 's why I came to Chuck , the king of digital imagining . Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a simple photographic print . Not details . Information . Watch the monitor . We have limitations on how much information the eye can perceive unaided . But with this special software , which I designed , we can detect hidden information . We can manipulate it , enhance it . Watch right here . There it is . It 's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy . So you 're saying ... that a ghost killed Teddy Holvey ? Has anyone checked the camera that took this photo ? The lens or pressure plate ? It all checked out . I think from the information , this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity . This information is the same reason why you 'll see a newspaper photo ... with Jesus ' face appearing in the foliage of an elm tree . It 's a chance occurrence of light and shadow . In order to get on those tracks , Teddy Holvey ... had to escape this child-proof halter that his mother tied to a sink . I 've seen slippery two-year-olds . So the C.M.E. Took it home and put it on his own two-year-old , and found out it was physically impossible for the kid to reach around and free himself . So , unless Teddy Holvey was the reincarnation of Houdini ... And that would be an X-File in itself . I don 't understand . There 's already been a formal inquest . We 're here apart from that investigation . We have reason to believe something may have been overlooked . - Like what ? - The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks . Oh , my God . There were over 100 witnesses . We saw Teddy ourselves . He was chasing a balloon . There was no one else around . It was an awful accident . But that 's all it was . An accident . Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy ? He was just a baby . Why would anybody want to hurt him ? I don 't know what you 're getting at . We loved Teddy . If you 're suggesting this is like that woman who drowned her kids in the lake , you 're way out of line . Mrs. Holvey , did you hear anything in the bathroom before Teddy disappeared ? I already told the inquest . I heard nothing . Mrs. Holvey , at the time of the accident , did you have any hired help ? No . My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born . Around the time of Teddy 's death , had you noticed anything strange happening around the house ? Things moved , odd objects appearing ? Anything like that ? It 's that damn smoke detector ! I 'll be right back . Ah , does this happen often ? It 's an old house . We have a problem with the wiring . Mother . Mother , it was just a false alarm . No ! Mother , stop it ! What is she saying ? Maggie ! You marry a devil . You have devil child . I 'm sorry . - You recognize this ? - Sure , it 's a swastika . It 's also known as a gammadion or fylfot . It 's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck . It 's been used by various cultures since the Middle Ages . The Holvey 's child had one on the back of his hand last night . My guess it was drawn there by the old lady to protect the boy . - I saw her drawing it . - And you didn 't think that was strange ? - I saw her drawing it . - And you didn 't think that was strange ? I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get . But just not from ghosties or beasties . Take a look at this . Have you ever heard of Munchausen by proxy ? Yeah , my grandfather used to take that for his stomach . It 's when a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing medical symptoms , usually as a way of gaining attention or status . If you look at Teddy Holvey 's medical history , you 'll see he was admitted to various hospitals ... ten times during the two years he was alive . That 's once every three months . Projectile vomiting at three months , diarrhea at four months , vomiting , diarrhea , diarrhea ? - Each time they were unable to determine the cause . - And no one questioned this ? The family moved a lot because of Steve 's job . And records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital . But this kind of abuse is not limited to just one child . So I checked out Charlie 's history as well . - Charlie had medical problems too ? - Since his brother was born . Which is right when Holvey 's mother-in-law moved in . Often the perpetrator of Munchausen by proxy will view the child as evil . The old woman would be a likely candidate , but it could be any family member . Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department , Scully ? Things have been strange since Golda , my mother-in-law , moved in with us . I met Maggie in Romania in 1984 . Golda forbade our marriage . Said I was the devil . After I transferred back to the U.S. , things got somewhat better , until Teddy was born and she came to live with us . That 's when the strangeness really started . What kind of strangeness ? Superstitions rule Golda 's life . She 'll spit when anyone compliments the kids . Once she moved in with us , she started pouring hot water over the threshold to ward off demons , tying red strings around the kids ' wrists . One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof . Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick a lot . And you suspect Golda ? She 'll call Charlie evil right to his face . But at the same time , she dotes on him like she 's afraid of him . Afraid of him or for him ? I just don 't know . Are you familiar with Munchausen by proxy ? Are you accusing us of child abuse ? Teddy 's medical records have raised some questions . I could never say this to Maggie , but I 've wondered if it wasn 't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day . I 'd like to interview your son Charlie , Mr. Holvey , with a professional counselor . Oh , boy . This is gonna be hard . What do they want ? To take Charlie away ? They want him to talk to a social worker . She 's expecting him . Social worker ? They 'll put lies into Charlie 's head . - You 're being unreasonable . - You want to take him away . You blame me for Teddy , and now you want to take him away from me ! I 'm not gonna listen . This is ridiculous ! If you want to come , you can , but I 'm taking Charlie now . No , Steven . He 's my son too . What is that ? Come on , Charlie . Let 's get your coat . - You have no right to do this . - Maggie . Come on . We 'll meet you out front . - Okay , you buckled in there ? - Yeah . Good . Damn it . No ! No ! Daddy ! No ! No ! No ! Daddy ! No ! Mulder . Daddy , no ! Daddy ! No ! Daddy ! Daddy ! You see this ? Find anything ? Yeah , maybe . Looks like ash . Yeah , it 's everywhere . Look at this . The Holvey 's said earlier that they had some problems with the wiring of the house . - It could be from the motor shorting out . - I checked . It 's working fine . - What do you think it is ? - I don 't know , but I 'm gonna have this analyzed . Before we do anything , I think we should get Charlie out of this house . I just put a call into a social worker who 's going to come and make a report . The courts are reluctant to intervene in these matters . Not when a child is in danger . And not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman 's bedroom . Really ? You still think this is Munchausen by proxy , Scully ? Without a doubt . What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . Stay away from our house ! - Hey , you want to see something weird ? - What ? Chem lab analysis of the ash from the Holvey 's house . - No trace of any metal , no carbon , no oxygen , no nothing . - What do you mean ? It contains nothing organic or inorganic . In fact , according to the technicians , this ash doesn 't exist . Come on . - Where are we going ? - To get a second opinion . Oh , wow ! Haven 't seen this for a while . Not since India , 1979 . - India ? - Before Chuck succumbed to the glamours of academia , he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail . It 's called Vibuti . Holy Ash . Technically , it 's known as an apport . Something that materializes out of thin air . Wait a second . Nothing just materializes out of thin air . You 've read the Bible ? - RememberJesus creating the loaves and the fishes ? - Yeah , but that was a parable . In 1979 , I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air . Too bad you didn 't take a picture . You could 've run it through your computer and seen the entire Last Supper . Vibuti is created during the presence of spirit beings . Or during bilocation , which is a phenomenon ... where a person 's energy is transported to a different location . That energy could have been what set off the garage door opener . - Yeah . - Yeah , that . - Or somebody activated the remote control . - Who are you suggesting ? Who was standing outside when the garage door opened unexpectedly on us yesterday ? The old lady . And Charlie . Mrs. Holvey ? My name is Karen Kosseff . I 'm a social worker with the F.B.I. I 've been instructed to file a report for the court . May I come in ? No . Please . I 've already had enough trouble . I understand , Mrs. Holvey . But if you won 't talk to me , I 'm going to have to put that in the report , and it could very well complicate your situation . - Mommy ! - Charlie ! Oh , my God ! Charlie . It 's okay , Charlie . It 's okay , Charlie . It 's okay . He 's been sick . My mother was supposed to be looking after him . Mother ! Mother ! Get out of my house ! Get out ! I have had enough , Mother . I want you out of my house . No ! Mother ! Mother ! Mother ! Agent Scully , the grandmother 's taken the child . She 's locked him in the room with her . She may have a knife . I 've called 9-1-1 . - What happened ? - There were three strange men performing some kind of ritual . No ! No , Nanna ! It is the only way . No ! Mother ! Oh , my God . Mother ! Mother ! Mother ! That should about do it . Okay , guys . Did you talk to Charlie ? He says he doesn 't remember anything . The coroner 's preliminary report states that she died of a heart attack . But those wounds , Mulder , I 'd swear it looked like her eyes were pecked out . There was more ash beneath the old woman 's body . And look at this . What is it ? It 's mugwort . I think it 's a ceremonial herb . You think this was a ritual killing ? No . The reverse swastika and red string around Charlie 's wrist are protective devices . - Protection against what ? - I don 't know . But I think the old woman knew the family was in trouble . And those men were here doing a ritual to help her . I told you before , get out of my house ! I am not interested in your superstition . Now , get out ! Now ! Mrs. Holvey ? - It 's all right . - Who are they ? They are the Calusari . In Romania they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites . What did he say ? He said it 's not over . The evil is still here . Excuse me . Sir , can I have a word with you ? I 'm with the F.B.I. I 'd like to ask you some questions . You were trying to protect the family , weren 't you ? You said there was still evil here . Sir ! I can arrest you if I have to . The evil that is here has always been . It has gone by different names through history : Cain , Lucifer , Hitler . It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men . If you 're trying to stop us , the blood will be on your hands . Mrs. Holvey ? This is a difficult time , but there are some questions that need to be answered . My mother used to say that evil follows evil . Once someone suffers a misfortune , they 'll always have bad luck . I used to think that was just a superstition . Now I don 't know what to believe . I blamed her , you know ? For all that 's happened . I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me . Punish you for what ? For abandoning the old ways . I was raised to believe as she did in spirits . The unseen world . When I married Steve and came to this country , I left all that behind . Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs ? She was trying to cleanse the house of evil . She thought Charlie was responsible somehow . How could he be responsible for all this horror ? He 's just a little boy ! We should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother 's bedroom . Charlie , I was told they found you in your grandmother 's room yesterday . Can you tell me about it ? Do you remember how you got there ? No . Your mother said you were there . Don 't you remember ? I wasn 't there ! Many people saw you in the room . It wasn 't me ! I wasn 't there ! It wasn 't me ! - Who was in the room ? - No ! Was there someone else in the room ? No ! I didn 't hurt her ! Charlie , Charlie . Who hurt your grandmother ? Charlie ! It was him ! Who , Charlie , who ? It was Michael ! Michael ! Mrs. Holvey ? We never told him . It was agreed upon . It was our secret . What secret , Mrs. Holvey ? What are you talking about ? Michael . He was Charlie 's twin . He was stillborn . Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it . My mother , she wanted to perform the ritual of separation when she heard of Michael 's death ... to divide their souls . She said if we didn 't , the world of the dead would follow Charlie . But it was just a superstition . Charlie ! I need your help ! - Charlie ? - He 's having a seizure . Don 't restrain him . Let 's turn him on his side so he doesn 't aspirate . Charlie , you 're going to be okay . - How 's Charlie ? - He 's resting . - How 's Mrs. Holvey ? - I 'm amazed she hasn 't broken down completely . She 's in the waiting room trying to get some sleep . The doctor said that Charlie had some kind of a seizure , but they 've been unable to determine the cause . I 'm sorry , Charlie . I didn 't mean to scare you . I 'm Nurse Castor . I 'm just going to give you something to help you sleep . - I don 't want a shot ! - I know , but that 's what happens when you spit out your medicine . - We have to give it to you some other way . - No ! Charlie , I just want you to relax . It 's not going to hurt . - Afterwards , I 'll give you a sticker . - Leave me alone ! Charlie , it 'll just be a little pinch . I want you to relax . - Stop it ! - Charlie , I want you to behave . - Leave me alone ! - I want you to behave . - Just relax . - No ! Don 't do it ! Don 't do it ! No , Michael ! Michael , don 't ! Mommy ? I want to go home now . Charlie ? What are you doing up ? Why are you dressed ? They said I could go home now . Who said that ? The doctors . They said I could leave . All right , then . Let 's just get your coat . We 'll talk to the doctors . No , Mommy . Let 's just go home . Now ! Okay , Charlie . We 'll go straight home . What are you looking at ? - Is that Mrs. Holvey ? - Where ? There . I think she 's got Charlie with her . Nurse ! - Are you all right ? - He hit me . - Who , Charlie ? - No , the other one . There were two of them , two boys . - We 've gotta get to Mrs. Holvey 's house . - Why ? That boy you saw leave ? That wasn 't Charlie . Are you saying that Mrs. Holvey left here with a ghost ? Spirit or ghost , I 'm not sure . But it 's what we saw in the photograph . It 's what the old woman was trying to protect the family from . - But ... - Whatever it is , it 's killed three people . You 've got to get to Mrs. Holvey 's before it happens again . What are you gonna do ? Get help . There you go , Charlie . - Aren 't you going to have some ? - No , dear , I 'm not hungry . - Tomorrow we can go to the park . - Yes , sure . Can I have a balloon ? Uh-huh . Can we ride the train , Mommy ? Now , you finish up and Mommy will be right back , okay ? Please , God , don 't let it be true . What are you doing , Mommy ? Mommy ? Guard the door . Mrs. Holvey ? Hello ? Come hold him down . Don 't look at it ! Look away or it will recognize you ! Charlie ? Mommy ? It hurts ! Do not let go ! He tricks you ! - Are you all right ? - Charlie ? Let the boy rest . We must find the mother . The boy needs her . - Scully , are you all right ? - We 're okay . How 's Charlie ? Charlie ? Hello , sweetie . - Charlie ? - It is over for now . But you must be careful . It knows you . The strange case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred ... during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved . The boy , who will celebrate his tenth birthday next month , remains under the watchful care of his mother . And though I believe him innocent of the crimes , I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari . That neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection ... against the howling heart of evil .

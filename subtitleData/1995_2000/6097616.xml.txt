 I have lived with a fragile faith , built on the ether of vague memories , from an experience that I could neither prove nor explain . When I was 12 , my sister was taken from me . Taken from our home by a force that I came to believe was extraterrestrial . This belief sustained me , fueling a quest for truths that were as elusive as the memory itself . To believe as passionately as I did was not without sacrifice , but I always accepted the risks ... to my career , my reputation , my relationships ... to life itself . Let 's move out ! He 's an F.B.I. Agent . His name 's Mulder . We need a frostbite bay stat ! Let 's get ready , please ! Take your warmer and get the blood ready . - Basal temp 's 86 degrees . - Right eye dilated . Left eye dilated . Let 's get him into that tub or we 're gonna lose him . On three . One , two , three ! - Was Agent Mulder brought here tonight ? - This is an authorized area . - Military personnel only . - I 'm a federal agent . You 're not going anywhere until we see some I.D. There is no time for this . A man is dying . What happened to me out on the ice has justified every belief . If I should die now , it will be with a certainty that my faith has been righteous . And if , through death , larger mysteries are revealed , I will have already learned the answer to the question that has driven me here : That there is intelligent life in the universe other than our own , that they are here among us , and that they have begun to colonize . I 'm Dana Scully . I 'm Agent Mulder 's partner . What are his vitals ? He 's suffering from extreme hypothermia . No . You 've got to get him out of the tub . - He 's dying . He 's lost his body heat . - You 've got to listen . You 're going to kill him . The cold is the only thing keeping him alive . His heart stopped . Get me one amp of epinephrine and a cannula . You got to see this , Captain . We got a U.F.O. Or something buzzing us . Right up here . - It 's been hovering up there for about 20 minutes . - Could be a helicopter . - Not the way it flew over us . - It 's coming at us again . It 's going to crash . - Reverse engines . - All astern . We 're going after it . ... has been covering this story , and files this report . Two days ago , the crew of an ice cutter working the Arctic Circle ... thought they had seen a U.F.O. When a strange aircraft plunged into the Beaufort Sea . But a short time later , they recovered what is now believed to be ... a Russian fighter pilot from the icy water , where he miraculously survived the extreme Arctic temperatures . The man was airlifted to a military hospital in Alaska , where he was listed in stable condition . While authorities have been trying to determine who the pilot is , we 've learned that he has apparently walked out of the hospital , and is now listed as missing . Reporting from our ... - Where is he ? - I don 't know ! - Hey , I 've been looking for you . - I was just down the street . Someone fired more shots at the White House last night . You gotta wonder about a country where even the president ... has to worry about drive-by shootings . - What are you working on ? - I found these in my E-mail this morning . - Three obituaries . - Sent by whom ? - Nobody I know , but obviously somebody that knows me . - Why ? The deceased are Dr. Landon Prince of Scranton , Pennsylvania , Dr. Dale Gayhart of New York City , and Dr. Harvey Buchanon ofTeaneck , New Jersey . All worked in abortion clinics . They died in arson fires . - Sounds like the work of militant right-to-lifers . - Sounds like it . Why would somebody send them to you ? - It 's taken me all morning to figure that out . - What 'd you find ? This is the latest victim : Dr. Landon Prince . And these are the other two victims : Drs. Gayhart and Buchanon . - Triplets ? - No . I can 't find any blood connection between them . In fact , I can 't find any records on them at all . It 's as if before they died , they never existed . What ? Dr. Prince performed legal , clinical abortions . Which seems to be having its own share of occupational hazards . You don 't know anything else about him ? He went about his work quietly . None of his family 's come forward . - What about a man you arrested ? This , uh , preacher ? - Rev. Calvin Sistrunk . He 's got a motive . He 's threatened abortion docs before . He was carrying this when we arrested him . We 're hoping for an indictment . As soon as you locate Dr. Prince 's remains . Yes . But that fact hasn 't been released . There have been two identical fire deaths . Neither body 's been found . We 're quite certain he was in the building . His car was in the parking lot . We found his keys in the stairwell where the fire was started . He 's been missing since the incident . - It could be we 'll just be finding teeth and bone . - Good afternoon . - Reverend Sistrunk . These are Agents Scully and Mulder . They want to ask you ... If Dr. Prince burns in hell 's fire for his murder of the unborn ? - If his damnation is God 's will ? - Is that what you think ? I guess it 's a question of opinion . Well , it 's my opinion that whoever killed Dr. Prince ... will also be linked to two other murders . - How do you feel about that ? - There are those who endorse ... the killing of the heathen sinner in God 's name , but I , sir , am not one of them . Have you been to New York and New Jersey in the past two weeks ? No , sir . - This clipping . Where 'd you get it ? - From the newspaper . Obviously , there are more of God 's soldiers seeking this man for judgment . - Which newspaper ? - The local paper , up in Binghamton . Oh , yeah . I remember this one . - The man who placed this paid cash . - Would you recognize his face ? I might . - No . That 's not him . - Do you have a record of his name or address ? No , we don 't . He wouldn 't sign anything . In fact , he called and asked to place that ad a second week . So we did , but he never came back to pay . - Thank you . - Sure . - Got a bad feeling about this case . - What do you mean ? Nothing about it makes sense . We 've got three deaths of identical victims , no bodies , a virtual non-suspect ... - Sounds just like an X-File . - You don 't even know who sent that information . Mulder , we 've been set up before . If somebody wanted to set us up , would they give us this little to go on ? There 's something bigger here , Scully . - I 'd be willing to bet there are more of these guys out there . - More victims ? Unless we get to them first . The deaths follow a pattern : New Jersey , New York , Scranton , and then an ad is placed here in Binghamton ... looking for a man exactly like the others . The killer 's moving in a northerly direction . Excuse me ? Excuse me . The , uh , number in the ad . - Would that be a voice mail ? - Yes , it is . - How would you access that ? - Well , you 'd start by paying the bill . Dial the number , then press 12-36 . There 's 24 messages responding to the ad . The first caller has seen the man in the photo in Syracuse . That 's north . Special Agent Weiss . This is Agent Mulder . I need to enlist your help . - Shoot . - I 'm heading your way with Agent Scully . A man in your area may be in danger . His name is Dr. Aaron Baker . He 's living in Syracuse . We need you to find him and sit on him ... until we can get there . You got it . I 'll call you back as soon as I track him down . Your plans will not succeed . Federal Agent . Drop your weapon . I said , drop it ! What the hell ? - Agent Mulder ? - Yes . Agent Weiss ? - Yes , sir . - Did you find Dr. Baker ? No , I 'm afraid not . No one 's home . - There 's two weeks ' worth of mail in the mailbox . - We may already be too late . - We should take a look around anyway . - Not much to see . - Agent Mulder has arrived . - Send him right in . Agent Mulder , please have a seat . - I 'm sorry I 'm late . I just flew in . - From ? - Syracuse . - Where you were doing what ? Agent Scully and I were following up a lead on a case . Did anyone authorize this investigation , Agent Mulder ? - No , sir . - Do you have paperwork on this case ? No , sir . L ... I 'd assumed we had ... an understanding with respect to the X-Files . I 'm sure it doesn 't surprise you that the people I have to answer to ... aren 't so understanding , particularly when one of their field agents is dead . - What ? - Special Agent Barrett Weiss . Out of the Syracuse office . His body was found stuffed in the trunk of a car ... in front of a house that you sent him to . It 's impossible . I spoke to Agent Weiss . I saw him at the house . Save it , Agent Mulder . Save it for your report . Until this is cleared up , your butt and mine are in a sling . And your investigation , official or otherwise , is terminated . - Sir ... - Don 't underestimate the seriousness of this . A man is dead . I want a full accounting on my desk in the morning . - Mulder . - Mulder , it 's me . Where are you ? - I 'm at home . - Agent Weiss is dead , Scully . - What ? - Somebody killed him , and Skinner hit the roof . We 're being grounded until he gets a full accounting . I just wish I knew what the hell was going on . Have you checked your E-mail this morning , Mulder ? - No . Why ? - I received something unsettling , and I wondered if you 'd gotten it too . - What is it ? - It 's a digitally-scanned photograph . There 's another one , Mulder . His name is Dr. James Dickens . - And , Mulder ? He 's here in Washington . - Yeah ? Stay where you are , Scully . I 'll be right there to pick you up . Agent Mulder ? My name is Ambrose Chapel . I work for the Central Intelligence Agency . I need to talk to you about the case you 're working on . What case is that ? The murder of certain identical victims . I have a story to tell , Agent Mulder . Believe me , you want to hear it . We 've known of their existence for a decade . We had no idea they were in the country until last year . - Who are they ? - We 're working on vague intelligence reports , but it appears that early in the cold war , Soviet scientists ... stumbled on a genetic anomaly in sets of identical twins . They were able to isolate the specific DNA material that gave the twins ... their facial features , hair color , texture ... And they were able to reproduce it . Are you saying these men are clones ? By all outward appearances . How did they get here ? The program went by the code name " Gregor , " the name given to every clone . We believe the original Gregor came here ... sometime in the mid - ' 70s , on a German passport . Using that same document , they were able to bring a small cadre of clones into the country , several of which have obtained ... strategic positions in the medical establishment . - For what purpose ? - In the event of war , they would mobilize simultaneously at different facilities across the U. S ... to contaminate blood supplies , sabotage pharmaceutical factories ... essentially destroy the country 's immune system . If you 've known about this for a year , why hasn 't anything been done ? Well , this is where the story gets perhaps even more incredible . In a secret agreement , someone is allowing the Gregors ... to be systematically eliminated ... by a man who I believe is a Russian spy-killer ... in exchange for the absolute suppression of the program 's existence ... and to obtain the science that created it . - What 's your business in this ? - I believe we share ... similar sentiments on our government 's policies of denial , which is why they 've been trying to contact you . - Who ? - The Gregors . You 've obviously got a reputation as someone who might protect them ... and bring these misdeeds to light . What makes you think we 've been contacted ? Your inquiries into their deaths . And your response to the ad I placed . We 're talking state-sanctioned murder . If we can find them first , maybe the truth can be known . We know where one of these men may be . Okay . Let 's go . - Who is it ? - Agents Scully and Mulder . We 're with the F.B.I. - Dr. Dickens ? - Yes . - I believe you 've been trying to contact us . - Uh ... - May we come in , Dr. Dickens ? - Uh ... It 's okay , sir . There 's nothing to be afraid of . I 'll call the paramedics . He 's moving . He 's getting up ! I 'll call you back . - You okay ? - Okay . I just got the wind knocked out of me . - Don 't lose him . Go ! - Okay . Are you all right ? He 's gone . - Where ? - He blindsided me . Went up the fire escape before I could grab him . I 'm gonna go see ... if I can find a way up on the roof . How are you feeling ? Like I should have used the crosswalk . - A lot better than my phone . - Maybe we should have dropped this case when you were told . Scully , if what our friend from the C.I.A. Says is true , this could blow the lid off one of the biggest national security conspiracies ever . Our " friend " from the C.I.A. Is about as unbelievable as his story , as is everything about this case . Whatever happened to " trust no one , " Mulder ? I changed it to " trust everyone . " I didn 't tell you ? I ran a full background check on this guy . Ambrose Chapel is a 17-year veteran . Special Intelligence Clearance . He 's the real thing , Scully . Why would a man with his experience need our help ? And how could he let a man he 's been looking so hard for ... slip away so easily ? That doctor wasn 't running away from us . He was running away from Agent Chapel . I think you 're being overly paranoid about him , Scully . Paranoid . Have you stopped to consider ... that maybe it was Chapel who killed that agent in Syracuse ? Is that what you want me to put on my report ? I 'd be happy to have you explain that to him . Damn it , Mulder , that is not my job . You 'll pursue a case ... at the expense of everything , to the point of insanity , and expect me to follow you . There has to be somewhere to draw the line . Three identical men are dead . A fourth identical man is alive and on the lam . If the pursuit of this case seems like insanity to you , step away from it . An F.B.I. Agent died because of our pursuit of this case . Those are the risks we take . You either accept them or you don 't . We all draw our own lines . I have to show you something . I got these a week ago . I stepped in something last night that ate clean through the sole . Now , maybe I 'm being paranoid , but it was in the exact spot where this man Chapel said the doctor escaped . Why don 't you send it to our lab guys for analysis ? While you 're at it , why don 't you arrange for an autopsy bay ? - An autopsy bay ? - Putting together my report for Skinner , I came across something I think you 'll appreciate . Whoever killed that field agent in Syracuse was so clever ... no clear cause of death can be established . There 's no penetrating knife or gunshot wounds , no ligature marks or abrasions from strangulation ; the toxicological is clean ; and the blood work ... well , the blood work is strange . - Strange how ? - There 's evidence of polycythemia ... excessive production of red blood cells . - How excessive ? - Extremely . The doctor who made this report has it that the blood was " curdled like jelly . " As if something caused the blood to thicken or clot prior to death . - Due to what ? - Possibly a coagulating agent ... introduced into the body , but it would have shown up on the toxicological . Didn 't Agent Chapel say something about these doctors ... being able to contaminate the blood supply ? Couldn 't one of those contaminants have been used to kill this man ? I don 't know , Mulder . L ... There was a doctor 's bag I took as evidence from the apartment . Agent Mulder ? Assistant Director Skinner 's been looking for you . All right . I 'll be right there . Check the bag . See if you can find anything . We 'll connect . Skinner 's gonna want to know why you didn 't file your report . What are you going to say ? Just the truth . I got hit by a car . I 'm sorry this is so late . I had trouble with the data ... That 's not why I called you in here , Agent Mulder . Your father 's been trying to reach you . There 's been a family emergency . Thank you . Hello ? - Mom ? - Fox , is that you ? Yeah , I didn 't expect you to answer . What are you doing at Dad 's ? Is he all right ? Yes . Let me put him on . - Hello ? - Dad ? I got a message there was a family emergency . I received a very strange phone call this afternoon . I called your mother . We think it 's important ... that you come up here as soon as possible . - Can you tell me what this is about ? - I 'll know more when you get here . I didn 't find much of anything to go on , but we 've got an address . Check it out . I 'll call you as soon as I can . - Where are you going ? - Home . This is Fox Mulder . Leave me a message and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . - Mulder , it 's me . I need to talk to you immediately . I 've got some new information on this case . Mulder , I think I 'm in danger . I 'm in my apartment , and I think I 've been followed . Your mother needs some time . You said it was an emergency . She wanted you to come . It 's a difficult time . I appreciate your coming at such short notice . What is it , Dad ? The certainty ... becomes a comfort that allows you to move on . We bury our memories so deep , after all that has been destroyed , never expecting ... Who is Mom talking to ? Your sister . Fox . After all those sleepless nights , now I can hardly keep my eyes open . Well , you 're exhausted . We all are . - It 's after 5 : 30 . - Oh , I just need a couple of hours . Try and get some sleep . - Fox . - Yeah , Mom ? It is really her . Isn 't it ? Um , I don 't see who else it could be . Go on . Go to sleep . Is it too late for a game of Stratego ? It 's 22 years too late . I don 't think Dad could think of anything to say . He just sat here . So much has happened . Where do you begin ? I must have been nine or ten when I was returned . I had no memory . I was placed with a family who raised me as a daughter . Who were they ? I knew they weren 't my parents , but I didn 't remember Mom or Dad . Or you . But you came to remember ... us . I started having trouble several years ago . It was diagnosed as free-floating anxiety . Nothing worked for me . I hit rock bottom . Until I underwent regression hypnotherapy . And it all started coming back . The abductions , the tests ... I 'm in danger , Fox . I 'm in danger , Fox . - What do you mean ? - You 've been contacted . You know there 's a man hunting my father and the other doctors . Your f ... Your father ? My adoptive parents . They 're only visitors here . What people would call aliens . A bounty hunter 's been sent to kill them . You 've met this man . His lies to you have caused others like my father to die . He won 't stop until he 's killed them all ... and anyone who tries to stop him . He 'll come for me soon . Hi . This is Dana Scully . Please leave a message , and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . - Scully , it 's Mulder . Pick up the phone . Okay , if you 're screening , pick up the phone . I need to talk to you . All right . Do not under any circumstances trust the C.I.A. Agent . Your life may be in danger . Call me . She may not be able to recognize him . He has the ability to disguise himself . - Disguise himself ? How ? - As anyone . As anyone ? You gotta be kidding . No . You can 't recognize him , but I can . - Hello . This is Fox Mulder . Leave a message , please . Mulder , it 's me . I 've just left my apartment and I don 't think I 've been followed . I 'm going to be staying at the Vacation Village Motor Lodge ... off the I-90 in Germantown . By the time you reach me , I should have some important information ... regarding this case . Wait ! Stop ! Federal Agent . Put your hands against the wall . - Do it ! - You won 't shoot me . Put your hands against the wall . Now . You cannot harm us . - Sir ... - It 's all right . We are the last remaining . Unless you protect us , we are already dead . These men are to be held at maximum security protective custody . No visitors , no press , no anybody . - Okay ? - Yeah . Can I ask ? Who are these guys ? I 'll let you know when I figure it out myself . I should have some important information regarding this case . - Vacation Village ? - Yeah , I need to speak to Dana Scully , please . Just a moment . I 'm sorry . There 's no one registered by that name . All right . I need her to call Fox Mulder . As soon as she checks in , okay ? Fox Mulder . - Fox Mulder . - Yes . Will do . Now , who 's this message for ? I 'd like a single for one night , please . Ah , see what I got . - Whose post is this ? - Mine , sir . We 're on changeover . I 'm gonna talk to the prisoners . You wanna give me a coffee ? Sugar and milk , no cream . - Do you want me to keep an eye open ? - No , just give me the coffee . Yes , sir . - Who is it ? - Scully , it 's me . - I got your message . - Where have you been ? Hang on . - Scully . - Scully , it 's me . Where are you ? Scully ? Are you there ? Scully ?

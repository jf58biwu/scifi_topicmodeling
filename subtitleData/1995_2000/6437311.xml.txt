 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman ? THEME SONG : Weird Science . Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . My creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . My creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand ? Hes alive . Alive ! Go , Farber High ! Oh , man . Oh , man . Didn 't I tell you ? These x-ray glasses rock . Oh wait , stop . Yo , dude , how come they 're not , like , naked ? You need the x-ray contact lenses for that . That 's probably a good thing , cause I got a heart murmur . This is too cool . I 've never been in a limo before . Want to stand up through the sun roof ? I 'd rather just snuggle with you . Works for me . Sunset ride along the coast ? Excellent . Coast highway , please , James . On our way . And stop calling me James . Oh my god . 10 : 00 . Tammy Fitch . Oh man , she 's coming this way . Hi , guys . What do you think of the new uniforms ? I think they 're unbelievable . Just looking at them fills me with pep . Well , thanks . Maybe we 'll see you at some more games this season . I 'm buying a season ticket . Oh ! Roger . Oh , man , my specs are wasted , man . Not to worry , buddy of mine . Gary Wallace is on the case . Gimme a sec . Your timing really sucks . Whoa . Give me those ! So , what do you need ? Make it quick . Why , you busy or something ? Oh , Wyatt . A little . What is it ? Need a new pair of horny goggles . Roger busted his . There . Hasta . Leopard skin ? Lance , you stud . Easy on the potholes , James ! James ? [ SCREAMING ] Sorry . Oh , James . You had no right to call Lisa away when she was with me . No right ? When did you become lord of the genie ? Settle down , guys . You 're supposed to be best friends . We 're the team , remember ? Well , this member of the team almost went flying off the Pacific Coast Highway at 65 miles an hour . Almost . You almost died . I definitely have a fat lip . You know , we never had these problems when it was just the three of us . Well , Gary and Roger have been so buddy buddy lately . At least my life doesn 't revolve around having a stupid girlfriend . At least I have a girlfriend . And I don 't need a pair of special glasses to see her in her underwear . Word around school is she 's dating you on a dare . Take it back . And she 's a guy . Take it back . Well , now we 've got that nasty tension out of our systems , let 's play a game of Jenga . Come on , Lis . Let 's go . Lisa 's not going anywhere . She lives with me . Well , maybe we should change that . I think she could live with me for a while . That way you couldn 't hog her all the time . Guys , look , let 's settle down and go back to being friends . I know we will- - once Wyatt backs down , like he always does . Not this time . Come on , Lis . Time to leave . You 're staying right here , Lisa . That does it . Where are we ? Welcome to Cyber Court . Hear ye , hear ye , these proceedings will now commence . Wallace versus Donnelly for the sole custody of their computer genie . Cyber Court is now in session . Let her rip . A custody hearing ? Isn 't that a little extreme ? Since you can 't work it out for yourselves , we 'll let the Cyber Court decide . Whoever wins gets custody . The loser will never see me again . So , what do you think , guys ? Pretty drastic , huh ? You ready to give it up and be friends again ? No way . Sounds like a great idea to me . It does ? I could live without ever seeing his ugly face again . You can ? Not a problem . We 'll just leave it up to the judge . Oh , how gracious of you . I am so beholden to you . You know , these things always sort of break my heart . May I see the child in question ? Hoo , boy ! Heads up , lads . May the best man win . Where 's you counsel ? Huh ? Counsel . That means lawyer . I know what it means . I just don 't have one . Well , you 've got to have counsel . I mean , who 's going to object and sum up , and make arguments and stuff ? You 've got to have counsel . Now pick one . Interactive attorney selection ? Please select your attorney now . Wow . I can have Abraham Lincoln as my attorney ? Hello . My name is Abraham Lincoln . Long before I was elected president , I gained prominence as a gifted young trial attorney . No brag , just a fact . Oh , good choice . The penny guy . My reputation speaks for itself . If you would have me , I would be proud to serve as your attorney . And I would be proud to have ya . Hello , son . I 'm Abraham Lincoln . I 've got Abraham Lincoln . Big whoop . My attorney will chew him up and spit out the beard . Check it out . I 'm BF Jackie , and if you 're sick of getting pushed around , let me push back for ya , cause that 's what I do . Push , push , push . But let 's let my clients speak for themselves . When a waitress spilled a cup of scalding hot coffee on this fat guy two tables over , I was emotionally scarred . BF Jackie got me $ 2.7 million . Thank you , BF Jackie . I peed on an electric transformer and suffered grievous bodily harm . BF Jackie told me I could sue the power company . I 've got 8.3 million . Thanks , BF Jackie . I 've seen his infomercial , like , 100 times . That teleportation . I think it threw my neck out . Remember I said that , kid . You may get subpoenaed . So , where 's it hurt ? Please say the leg . Legs are worth a pile . Sprained , fractured , you name it . This is a custody battle . Oh , right . Tether your acts in , counselor . As lawyers it is our sacred responsibility to ensure that justice is served in a fair and equitable fashion . Careful , pops . You don 't want to give away your strategy . Seems a nice enough fella . On with the custody battle . So , let me see if I have this right . You are an honor student , you 're active in the community , and you love your mama . Yeah , basically . Your witness , counselor . So besides being a mama 's boy , you 're quite a big shot at school , huh ? Big plans for the future ? I hope to follow my father 's footsteps . After college . Would you characterize your father as a particularly ambitious , driven individual ? That 's him . Good dad ? Help you with your homework ? School projects ? Go to games together ? When he has the time . But does he ever have the time ? When was the last time you even talked to your father ? I don 't know . He 's been out of town . A couple of weeks ago . Couple ? More like three weeks , isn 't it , Mr. Donnelly ? Three weeks since you 've spoken to your father . Three weeks , your honor . Three weeks what ? I 've just proved that Wyatt Donnelly 's going to grow up to be a bad father . You did ? Well done . Certainly looks bad for you , Mr. Donnelly . You may step down now . Had enough ? Keep this up and useless Abe is gonna fix it so you never see me again . We 're not doing so bad . You kidding ? You 'd have a better shot at winning if you peed on an electric transformer . Relax , Lis . It 's all part of our strategy . Be the bigger man . Apologize to Gary . You know how stubborn he gets . Once the court makes a decision , I 'm not going to be able to stop them . Well , it 's fine with me , cause I 'm gonna win . I turn the court 's attention to exhibit A. It 's a synaptic display unit . It plays back memories . Oh . I remember that day . That was back when we all used to be friends . JACKIE : Baseball , America 's pastime . And here we see Gary dipping into his meager allowance to shower his genie with love and attention . His reward ? Her happy smile , your honor . That 's all the testimony we need . Oh . That is so nice . Your honor , we 'd like to continue viewing the memory please . I 'd like that , too . I want to see who wins that game . Hit it , kid . Foul ball . Hey , I forgot about that part . My client clearly acted in self defense . I 'd be more concerned about the intentional genie abuse inflicted by Wyatt and the hot dog . Huh ? That cold , sadistic reptile Wyatt Donnelly deliberately slathered too much spicy mustard on Lisa 's hot dog . [ COUGHING ] Ladies and gentlemen , I ask you to remember this- - if the hot dog 's too mustardy , you must award custody . [ APPLAUSE ] Woo ! I don 't know about you , but I know who I 'm voting for . I need a quick recess so I can write that one down . Court now in recess so he can write that one down . Gary , how could you do that to your best friend ? It 's not hard when your lawyer 's a super sleaze like mine . Thanks , man . Listen to me , you 've gotta drop the case . Be the bigger man . Apologize to Wyatt . You know how stubborn he gets . Drop the case while we 're winning ? Brilliant . Why didn 't I think of that ? Big help , sweetie . Thanks . Your honor , I really would like the chance to speak . Seeing as how you just spoke without my permission , I 'd say you 're one up on me . Sneaky . Court 's back in session . But- - Shush . We gotta regroup . We 're getting boned here . Not to worry , young Wyatt . Once we cross-examine that skinny stripling , we 'll expose him for the ambitionless slug he is . Ambitionless ? Yeah , I guess that 'd be accurate . How about free time activities ? Are you busy with chores , school clubs , volunteer work ? Sports ? Fiddlesticks . He 's taking all my best questions . Part time job ? Study ? Nah . So having time to devote to your genie doesn 't present itself as a problem , then ? Your honor , I really must- - Ah , ah , ah . Take a lock . Proceed . Do you have a girlfriend , Mr. Wallace ? No . But if I did , I wouldn 't be like Wyatt and ditch my best friend . He ditched you ? This comes as a shock to me . Good god . What kind of monster is this Wyatt Donnelly , ditching this poor , lonely , frustrated , torqued up , pathetic shell of a human being ? What about you dumping me for Roger ? Didn 't think to zap up a pair of x-ray specs for me , did ya ? Well , I like to look at naked people , too . Order in the court . We all like looking at naked people . Well , gracious , who doesn 't ? We rest , your honor . So , uh , Mr. Loser- - I mean , Mr. Lincoln , would you care to try to pull this one out of the fire ? Hm ? For our final witness we call to the stand Lisa the genie . Well , it 's about bloody time . You 're calling Lisa ? You said it better than I ever could . We 're getting boned . It 's time to roll the dice and force the genie to choose between the two of you . Isn 't that a big risk ? Brother , I didn 't win the Civil War by being a candy ass . Miss Genie , I 'll come right to the point . Of the two boys , which do you feel is the more responsible ? Objection . Overruled . What grounds ? Feel like it . Go ahead , high pockets . Could I say something first ? I 've been waiting to talk . Please answer the question . Which boy is more responsible ? Well , Wyatt may be more responsible , but Gary 's got- - Thank you . And which boy would you say is smarter ? If you put a gun to my head , I 'd have to say Wyatt . But intelligence isn 't- - Thank you . In your opinion , who has better personal hygiene ? Gary . Huh ? You 're under oath , miss . OK . Wyatt . And now for the big question . Now , think before you answer . Between Gary and Wyatt , who do you prefer to stay with ? Look , this is all a big mistake . The Cyber Court wish was intended to teach the guys a lesson . It wasn 't supposed to get this far . I 'm waiting for my answer , miss . I can 't choose between Gary and Wyatt . I love them both . Answer the question , or I shall declare you in contempt . I 'm not choosing between them , and you can 't make me . This is my courtroom , miss . I 'm gonna talk now , and the first perosn who tries to stop me gets turned into a funnel cake . I am the last word around here , missy , and I do not allow any genie hoodoo in this courtroom . You took my magic . Well , see , you were glowing and stuff , so I- - If you have anything you want to say in your defense , I guess I 'll allow it . These two guys and I have been through a lot together , your honor . We 've shared a lot of great experiences and adventures . You dance divinely . And some not so great experiences . Actually , a lot of near fatal experiences , when you get right down to it . But I wouldn 't have traded our friendship for anything . Your honor , I need Gary and Wyatt in my life . Both of them . They created me . I 'm equal parts of each of their personalities . Hm I got the good parts , you see . Wyatt gave me compassion and understanding , and intelligence , and Gary gave me a sense of humor and generosity . And a bod that just won 't quit . I 'm living proof of how good they are together . I 'm like , their friendship in the flesh . And if you took me away from either one of them , it would really suck . And that 's all I have to say . [ APPLAUSE ] Sorry , Lis . We were real jerks . We 'll never put you through this again . We promise . Uh , Mr. Judge , sir ? Hm ? I 'd like to drop my case . Why do I set myself up ? I give and I give , and this is the thanks I get . I 'm dropping my case , too . I think our differences turned out to be reconcilable after all . Cool ? Cool . This is better than when the North and South got back together . Order in this court ! Hold it ! For your information , when you two began this custody battle you were also putting your friendship on trial . By doing this , you have surrendered your fate to me , and this won 't be over until I have delivered my verdict . Now , then , Wyatt Donnelly , Gary Wallace , as neither of you has proven to be a fit genie custodian , this court hereby declares Lisa the genie to be a ward of the internet . Help ! What are you doing to her ? Well , her data clusters are being stripped away and distributed across the internet . I can 't feel my toes . Take us instead ! Lisa hasn 't done anything wrong . The decision of this court is final . Objection . Mr. Lincoln , you are out of order . I 'm out of order ? I 'm out of order ? You are out of order . This whole courtroom 's out of order . I see why that guy 's on the $ 5.00 bill . He is one bad mother . I may not know about videos , or computers , or these cybers that everybody keeps talking about , but I do know about justice . These boys belong with their friend , and you are keeping them apart . My word is law as long as I am sitting on this side of the bench . Then we 'll move the bench . Used to be a wrestler and a bare knuckle boxer . Dang near killed a fella once . The counsel makes a stirring argument . I , uh- - Cyber Court hereby remands Lisa the genie to the custody of Wyatt Donnelly and Gary Wallace . Case dismissed . I 'm OK ! My clusters are back . And they 've never looked better . No , I really can 't tonight . I 'm hanging out with Gary . Cool . I 'm glad you understand . All right , well , I 'll see you on Monday . Bye . Holly took that pretty well . And I lent Roger my magic whoopie cushion . That should keep him happy all weekend . This is great . The three of us are together again , and everything 's the way it should be . [ WHISTLING ] [ SCREAMING ] Well , looks we got one too many bulls in the pen . While you 're here , you might as well get my back . Loofa ? If you don 't mind . Oh , that 's the spot . THEME SONG : Weird Science . Fantasy and microchips shooting from the hip . Something different will make it weird science . Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

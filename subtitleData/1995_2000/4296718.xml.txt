PURSUE ALPHA WITH EXTREME CAUTION . MULDER ! DAMN IT . AGENT SCULLY ! SCULLY ! - WHAT HAPPENED ? - I LOST HIM . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? HE GOT AWAY . I CAME IN EARLY . I WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE TO MAKE SURE I WASN 'T CRAZY . [ Sighs ] WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE , MULDER ? " WHAT HAPPENED " ? THERE WERE 12 AGENTS YESTERDAY IN THE PARK . WE HAD OWNERSHIP OF THE SUSPECT . WE WERE IN POSITION TO MAKE THE CAPTURE , AND YOU LET HIM GET AWAY . AND FROM WHAT I SEE NOW , YOU MAY HAVE EVEN AIDED IN HIS ESCAPE . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . IT 'S ON THE VIDEO , MULDER . I CAN 'T PROVE IT WAS YOU , BUT I KNOW WHAT I SAW . THIS MAN IS A MURDERER . HE 'S A TERRORIST . I HAVE A REPORT TO GIVE THIS MORNING . I EXPECT YOU TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER . I EXPECT YOU TO TELL ME THE TRUTH . WE 'RE LATE FOR THE HEARING . [ Door Opens ] FIFTEEN HOURS AGO , A JOINT F.B.I.-C.I.A. TASK FORCE ... ASSEMBLED TO CAPTURE JACOB STEVEN HALEY , SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE MILITIA GROUP KNOWN AS NEW SPARTANS . INTELLIGENCE REVEALED HALEY WAS TO MAKE AN EXCHANGE OF MONEY ... FOR A QUANTITY OF AUTOMATIC WEAPONS ... TO CONDUCT DOMESTIC TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ... AND TO FURTHER THEIR EXPRESSED GOAL OF OVERTHROWING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . DUE TO REASONS THAT ARE STILL UNDER REVIEW , OUR OPERATION FAILED . JACOB STEVEN HALEY REMAINS AT LARGE , WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN . WHAT ABOUT THE WEAPONS ? AN ARMS DEALER NAMED KHADRI WHO DIED AT THE SCENE RECEIVED FROM HALEY ... A $ 50,000 BEARER BOND . PRESUMABLY THIS WAS PAYMENT FOR WEAPONS DELIVERED . IN OTHER WORDS , HALEY NOT ONLY GOT AWAY , HE GOT AWAY WITH $ 50,000 WORTH OF GUNS ? HAVE WE DETERMINED A CAUSE OF DEATH , HOW HALEY KILLED THIS MAN ? HE WAS KILLED BY MEANS OF A HIGHLY TOXIC BIOLOGICAL AGENT . - WHAT KIND OF TOXIN ? - WE DON 'T KNOW . ITS EFFECT ON THE DERMIS AND THE SOFT TISSUES , THE RAPIDITY OF ITS ACTION- - IT IS NOT A DISEASE KNOWN IN NATURE . IT WOULD SEEM TO BE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED- - A BIO-WEAPON . HOW THE HELL DID HE GET IT ? [ Man ] THE FORMER SOVIET UNION . SECURITY ON THE SIBERIAN VECTOR LAB ... IS , UH , LAX . IT 'S CONCEIVABLE IT WAS STOLEN , THOUGH WE HAVE NO CONFIRMATION FROM MOSCOW . SO , IS THIS IN THE OZONE NOW ? IS THIS STUFF FLOATING THROUGH FOLGER PARK ? [ Scully ] LEVEL FOUR DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES ... WERE UNDERTAKEN IMMEDIATELY . OUR BEST INDICATIONS ARE THAT EXPOSURE WAS LIMITED ... AND THAT THE TOXIN WAS TRANSMITTED DIRECTLY AND NOT CONTAGIOUS . - HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ? - [ Mulder ] WE 'RE NOT ALL DEAD . [ Smattering Of Nervous Laughter ] AT THIS POINT WE CAN ONLY GUESS ... THAT THE TOXIN WAS TRANSMITTED BY LIQUID OR GAS , TOUCH OR INJECTION . ANYBODY CARE TO TELL ME HOW THIS GUY HALEY ELUDED US ? [ Skinner ] VIDEO RECON INDICATES HALEY HAD AN ACCOMPLICE AT THE PARK . WE 'VE YET TO IDENTIFY WHO THIS WAS OR HOW HALEY KNEW HE WAS UNDER SURVEILLANCE . - HE MUST HAVE MADE US . - COULD HE HAVE ? EVERY MEMBER OF THIS TASK FORCE WAS CHOSEN FOR THEIR LACK OF EXPOSURE IN TERRORIST CIRCLES . HALEY 'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS , TO THE POINT OF PARANOIA . HE 'S GOT MILITARY TRAINING AND A GUERILLA MENTALITY . SECOND ONLY TO THIS MAN . AUGUST BREMER . HE 'S THE GROUP 'S MASTERMIND . HOWEVER , THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE AND HALEY ARE VYING FOR CONTROL . THIS DESTABILIZATION MAKES AUGUST BREMER OUR PRIMARY THREAT . WELL , THIS IS IT , THE SCENARIO WE 'VE ALL BEEN WORRIED ABOUT , PEOPLE . NOW , I NEED MAXIMUM CONTROL OF INFORMATION . NOTHING LEAVES THIS ROOM . THE MEDIA GETS A SNIFF , WE 'RE GONNA DISAVOW . WE ARE GONNA STOP THESE MEN . WE 'RE GONNA MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY . [ Agents Murmuring , Whispering ] MULDER . THE SHOW 'S ALMOST OVER . ONE , PLEASE . [ Man ] MEET YOU OVER THERE , OKAY ? [ Woman ] ALL RIGHT . THANKS . I 'D LIKE SOME POPCORN , PLEASE . DO YOU WANT LARGE , EXTRA LARGE ... OR JUMBO LARGE ? COULD I GET SOME FRESH POPCORN , PLEASE ? THE SIGN SAYS " FRESH POPCORN . " - THIS IS FRESH POPCORN . - NO , FRESHFRESH . HOT , OUT OF THAT MACHINE BACK THERE . PLEASE . A LARGE . I HAVE TO MAKE IT . PROBABLY TAKE A MINUTE . [ Phone Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] - YEAH ? - YOU SET ME UP . - I SAVED YOUR ASS . - THEN WHY WASN 'T I TOLD ? [ Mulder ] I DIDN 'T KNOW ABOUT THE OPERATION . IT WAS YOUR OPERATION . NO , NO , THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP . I FOUND OUT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE IT WENT DOWN . I DID WHAT I COULD . - YOU 'LL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT , MULDER . - WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY ? I GOT AS MUCH TO LOSE HERE AS YOU DO . THEY CATCH YOU , YOU 'LL FLIP ME . LOOK , I BELIEVE IN YOUR IDEALS AND YOUR GOALS . THE ONLY REASON I TOLERATE YOUR METHODS IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 'S ARE WORSE . WOW , WHAT A RINGING ENDORSEMENT . HEY , YOU CAME TO ME . REMEMBER ? WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM ME ? I 'VE RISKED EVERYTHING . I 'VE GIVEN YOU INFORMATION . MY PARTNER IS SERIOUSLY SUSPICIOUS . IF THAT 'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU , THAT 'S ALL I GOT . [ Boy ] AIN 'T NOBODY HOME . OH , SHE 'S IN THERE . SHE 'S JUST HIDIN' OR SOMETHIN ' . WE COULD MAKE A BREAK FOR IT , RIGHT THROUGH THE FRONT DOORS . WHY ? I GOT US FRONT-ROW SEATS . [ Chuckles ] [ Whispers ] HERE . [ Movie : Man ] TRUST ME , GUYS . SHH . [ Giggling ] SHH ! [ Movie : Man ] DUCK . dddd [ Orchestral , Dramatic ] [ Movie : Man Grunts ] LOOK OUT ! SHE SEE US ? IS SHE COMING ? [ Movie Soundtrack Continues ] HEY , MAN . [ Gasps ] MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT 'S GOING ON . WHAT ? THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM . A MAN JUST TOLD ME YOU GAVE HIM KEYS TO MY ROOM- - ROOM 130 . WHO ARE YOU ? WHO AMI ? WHO IS HE ? MR. , UH , KAPLAN . MR. KAPLAN . YES . THANK YOU . ARE YOU THE WIFE ? NOT EVEN CLOSE . [ Sighs ] [ Rings ] YEAH ? WE 'LL PROCEED AS PLANNED . [ Door Closes ] [ Man Whispers ] AGENT MULDER , YOU 'RE COMING WITH US . [ Engine Starts ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Knocking On Window ] - STEP OUT OF THE CAR . - [ Knocking Continues ] [ Scully ] EXACTLY WHAT AGENCY ARE YOU GUYS FROM ? OBVIOUSLY NOT THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION . [ Knock On Window ] AGENT SCULLY , TAKE A SEAT . WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ? - I APOLOGIZE FOR OUR METHODS . - THEY MAY WELL HAVE SAVED AGENT MULDER 'S LIFE . WHAT ABOUT MY LIFE ? I DON 'T APPRECIATE BEING RUN OFF THE ROAD . WE HAD OUR REASONS . YOU 'RE SUSPICIOUS AGENT MULDER 'S BETRAYED HIS COUNTRY . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . YOUR DISCRETION IS UNDERSTANDABLE . IN POINT OF FACT , AGENT MULDER 'S ACTIONS ARE ENTIRELY HONORABLE . WHAT YOU 'VE STUMBLED INTO IS A CLASSIFIED ACTION , A DEEP COVER ASSIGNMENT . UNTIL NOW , AGENT MULDER 'S TRUE MISSION WAS KNOWN ONLY TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY AND MYSELF . HIS " TRUE MISSION " ? THE COUNCIL WE SAT IN WAS A FRONT ... TO MAKE THE NEW SPARTANS BELIEVE WE WERE UNAWARE OF AGENT MULDER 'S COMPLICITY . WHY HIM ? - WHY CHOOSE AGENT MULDER ? - WE DIDN 'T CHOOSE HIM . THEY DID . HE SPOKE AT A U.F.O. CONFERENCE IN BOSTON , WHERE HE APPARENTLY BROADCAST HIS FEELINGS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT ... AND THEIR CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . SOMEBODY FROM THE ORGANIZATION WAS LISTENING . THE MAN WHO ESCAPED- - HALEY- - SENT OUT FEELERS ... IN HOPES THAT AGENT MULDER WAS A MAN WHOSE POLITICS WERE IN LINE WITH HIS OWN . SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE THAT HE COULD USE . - TO WHAT AIM ? - THAT , WE DON 'T KNOW . YOU 'VE PUT AGENT MULDER 'S LIFE IN DANGER BY NOT TELLING ME . AGENT MULDER CAME TO ME . I ADVISED HIM NOT TO TELL YOU . HE 'S AT A VERY DELICATE POINT . EVERYTHING HE DOES NOW MUST WORK TO BUILD TRUST . INCLUDING LETTING THIS MAN HALEY GET AWAY WITH MURDER ? SIR , WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS BIO-WEAPON . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO USE IT FOR . WE DON 'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO STORE IT SAFELY . PUTTING AGENT MULDER IN THIS SITUATION ... IS EXTREMELY RISKY . THEY WANT SOMETHING FROM HIM . WE HAVE NO OTHER WAY OF LEARNING WHAT . - [ Door Opens ] - MOVIE THEATER IN OHIO . WHATEVER THEY 'RE USING , THEY 'VE USED IT AGAIN . [ Engine Off ] [ Emergency Brake Sets ] IS THIS THE PEPSI CHALLENGE ? HOW ABOUT SOME FRESH AIR , BOYS ? [ Sighs ] WELCOME , AGENT MULDER . OKAY , DEAL ME IN . THIS IS JUST A LITTLE METHOD THAT WE USE ... TO LEARN THE TRUTH . YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT THAT HOOD BACK ON ME , UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE A GROWN MAN CRY . WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PARK ? [ Exhales ] I TOLD YOU ON THE PHONE . - [ Groans ] - I WAS SET UP . I 'M TELLING THE TRUTH . WAIT . WAIT . WAIT ! [ Gasps ] I LET YOU GO . YOU 'RE SPYING ON US , AREN 'T YOU ? NO . NO ! AAAH ! [ Groans ] YOU WANT ME TO LIE AND SAY YES ? [ Groans ] I 'M GONNA KILL YOU , YOU SON OF A BITCH ! I 'M GONNA KILL YOU ! IF I SET YOU UP , YOU THINK I 'D GET IN THE CAR WITH THIS NAZI PIECE OF SH- [ Finger Cracking ] - AAAH ! I RISKED EVERYTHING ! IF I WAS LYING , THERE 'D BE FEDERAL AGENTS DESCENDING ON THIS PLACE ... LIKE THE WRATH OF GOD RIGHT NOW ! YOU TOUCH ME AGAIN , YOU 'D BETTER KILL ME ! [ Groaning ] A WAR IS GOING ON , AGENT MULDER . EITHER YOU 'RE ON THE RIGHT SIDE , OR THE WRONG . [ Exhaling Sharply ] - YOU 'VE SEEN THE EFFECTS OF THIS ? - YES . - WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM AGAIN ? - NO . I DIDN 'T SET YOU UP . IF YOU GOT SET UP , IT WAS ONE OF YOURS . - [ Snaps ] - [ Shouts ] [ Mulder Whimpers ] YOU KNOW WHAT ? I BELIEVE YOU . AS FAR AS I CAN TELL , YOU 'RE ALL CLEAR IN THERE . WHAT ARE YOU READING IN THERE ? WE 'VE BEEN THROUGH AND THROUGH . NO HOT ZONES , NO ATMOSPHERICS . YOU 'RE CLEAR , AGENT SCULLY . THANK YOU . THERE 'S 14 VICTIMS TOTAL , INCLUDING PATRONS , A PROJECTIONIST AND AN EMPLOYEE . [ Sighs ] THAT 'S THE USHERETTE . THERE WERE TWO SURVIVORS- - TWO TEEN-AGED BOYS . HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THOSE TWO KIDS SURVIVED ? I DON 'T KNOW , BUT IT 'S GONNA HELP US ESTABLISH A METHOD OF DELIVERY . IT 'S DOUBTFUL THE PATHOGEN WAS AIRBORNE . THEY FOUND NO ATMOSPHERIC TRACES . SO IT 'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY TOUCHED . DON 'T BE ALARMED . SCULLY , GET OUTTA HERE . - MULDER- - - GET OUTTA HERE ! I KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE DOING . SKINNER TOLD ME EVERYTHING . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND ? NOTHING . OH , MULDER , WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU ? THIS NEEDS TO BE SET . YOU 'RE IN PAIN . YEAH , IF YOU KEEP PULLING IT AROUND LIKE THAT . LET 'S GET THE SWELLING DOWN . [ Sighs ] THEY 'VE KILLED AGAIN , MULDER . FOURTEEN PEOPLE IN A MOVIE THEATER IN OHIO . THE SAME TOXIN THEY RELEASED IN THE PARK . FOURTEEN PEOPLE ? THAT DOESN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE . UNLESS IT WAS A TEST ... FOR SOMETHING BIGGER . WHY DO THIS TO YOU , MULDER ? [ Mulder On Transceiver ] THEY 'RE TESTING ME TOO . HALEY 'S PARANOID , SPOOKED . I WAS SURE HE WAS GONNA KILL ME . [ Scully On Transceiver ] WHAT STOPPED HIM ? [ Mulder ] HE STILL NEEDS SOMETHING FROM ME . I 'M SENSING THERE 'S SOMEONE HALEY TRUSTS EVEN LESS . THE MAN GIVING HIM HIS ORDERS . SOMEONE I HAVEN 'T MET YET . A GUY NAMED AUGUST BREMER . WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND ? TERRORIST LIE DETECTOR . WELL , DID YOU PASS ? I MUST HAVE . I 'M STILL HERE . THEY TOLD ME WHAT THEY WANT . DOCUMENTATION FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK . FUND TRANSFER SCHEDULES FOR THE EASTERN SEABOARD . CASH MONEY . THEY 'RE GONNA HIT A BANK OR AN ARMORED CAR . THAT 'S IT ? THAT 'S ALL ? I THINK I CONVINCED HALEY THAT THE NEAR MISS IN FOLGER PARK ... WAS DUE TO A MOLE INSIDE HIS OWN GROUP . - HE WANTS SURVEILLANCE FILES ON THEM . - HOW SOON ? THEY 'RE WAITING FOR MY CALL . WE 'LL NEED SOME TIME TO DUMMY SOMETHING UP . NO , NO , I ANTICIPATED THIS . I 'VE GOT FILES READY TO USE . I 'M GETTING A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS . I WANT A TAIL ON HIM . NO TAIL . ONCE THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT , WHAT 'S TO KEEP THEM FROM KILLING HIM ? THEY SPOT A TAIL ON HIM , THEY 'RE GONNA SHOOT HIM ON THE SPOT . WE HAVE GOT NO OTHER WAY OF LEARNING WHAT THEY WANT PAST THIS , WHAT THE BIG PICTURE IS . YOU MAY NOT HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO CONTACT US . IF YOU DON 'T HEAR FROM ME BY MIDNIGHT , FEED MY FISH . [ Man ] THAT 'S IT . THAT 'S YOUR BUG . [ Scully ] IT 'S A BACTERIUM . AN ESPECIALLY VIRULENT ONE . WE ISOLATED IT FROM THE BEARER BOND . WAS THE BACTERIUM ALSO FOUND ON THE TICKET STUB ? ACTUALLY , NO . BARRING THE USUAL PARTICLES AND DUST MITES , THE TICKET STUB WAS CLEAN . WELL , THEN HOW WAS THE BIOTOXIN SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE THEATER ? I DON 'T KNOW . [ Scully ] IT LOOKS LIKE STREPTOCOCCUS . A STRAIN OF STREPTOCOCCUS , BUT ONE THAT HAS BEEN GENETICALLY ALTERED ... TO MAKE IT EXTRAORDINARILY LETHAL . BUT STREP WOULDN 'T BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ANY KIND OF EXPOSURE TO THE ENVIRONMENT . NORMALLY , BUT , UH , WHOEVER PRODUCED THIS ... HAS CLEVERLY COATED THE BACTERIUM ... WITH A SYNTHETIC PROTECTIVE COVERING . [ Beeps ] THE COVERING GIVES THEM AN ADHESIVE QUALITY . IT 'S LIKE SCRATCH-AND-SNIFF . DERMAL CONTACT ACTIVATES THE CONTAGION . IT 'S INGENIOUS , IN ITS OWN EVIL WAY . DEVELOPED BY THE RUSSIANS ? NO , I 'VE SEEN EVERYTHING IN THE RUSSIAN ARSENAL . THEY 'VE GOT NOTHING THIS SOPHISTICATED . WELL , THEN , BY WHOM ? [ Door Closes ] [ Light Switch Clicking ] DO YOU HAVE WHAT WE NEED ? TELL THE GIMP TO BACK OFF . GIVE ME THE FILES . I NEED THAT BACK BY TOMORROW . LIES WITHIN LIES . PUT THE HOOD ON . YOU 'RE GOING WITH US . NO . YOU PUT IT ON , OR THE GIMP PUTS IT ON FOR YOU . [ Ring ] SKINNER . THE BIOTOXIN WAS APPLIED TO THE BEARER BOND WITH AN AEROSOL SPRAY , BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF IT WHATSOEVER ON THE THEATER STUBS . NOW , I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW THESE KIDS WERE UNAFFECTED . HAVE YOU I.D. ' D THE TOXIN ? AGENT SCULLY ? SIR , ARE YOU ALONE ? NO . WHY ? I 'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU IN PRIVATE . [ Click ] YOU 'RE OFF THE SPEAKER . THANK YOU . NOW , C.I.A. INTELLIGENCE SUGGESTED THAT THIS BIOTOXIN WAS STOLEN FROM THE RUSSIANS , BUT MY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT IT WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY DEVELOPED DOMESTICALLY . THE UNITED STATES HAS NO BIO-WEAPONS . PRESIDENT NIXON DISMANTLED OUR PROGRAM IN 1969 . YES , SIR , THAT 'S WHAT WE 'VE BEEN TOLD , BUT THE C.D.C. DATABASE CONTAINS EVIDENCE OF A STREPTOCOCCUS BACTERIUM ... BEING DEVELOPED BY THE ARMY 'S PINE BLUFF FACILITY IN THE 1960s . IT APPEARS TO BE A VERY PRIMITIVE STRAIN OF WHAT WE 'RE SEEING HERE . WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? WHAT I 'M SAYING IS THAT THE BIO-WEAPONS PROGRAM MAY HAVE CONTINUED IN SECRET ... AND THAT SOMEONE MAY BE SENDING AGENT MULDER ON A SUICIDE MISSION . RIGHT . THANK YOU . WHAT IS IT ? SHE 'S JUST CONCERNED FOR HER PARTNER . YOU PUT US ALL AT RISK BRINGING HIM HERE . WE TOOK THE USUAL PRECAUTIONS . ANYWAY , HE CAME THROUGH FOR US . FEDERAL RESERVE SCHEDULES FOR TOMORROW . YOU 'RE A BELIEVER ? I HAVE MY BELIEFS . YOU WILLING TO DIE FOR THEM ? I 'D PREFER IT DIDN 'T COME TO THAT . WE HAVE A JOB TO DO . [ Bremer ] YOU 'RE DRACULA . [ Sighs ] OH , DAMN . [ Sighs ] THE MONEY . OH , MY GOD . THE MONEY . MULDER , TAKE IT . MAKE SURE YOU POINT THAT THE RIGHT WAY . MAY I HAVE THE KEYS , PLEASE ? YES , HERE . [ Alarm Beeping , Volume Increasing ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Beeping Stops ] YOU DO WHAT I SAY , OR I 'LL SHOOT YOU ! THREE MINUTES ! OPEN THE GATE . OPEN IT ! - GET DOWN ! NOW ! - [ All Screaming ] EVERYBODY DOWN ! DON 'T BE FOOLISH ! GIVE US THE MONEY , AND WE 'LL BE GONE ! MOVE BACK ! COME ON ! MOVE IT ! ALL RIGHT , HIT IT ! DOWN , NOW ! - DON 'T TOUCH THAT PHONE ! - DRACULA , TAKE THE TELLER . STEP AWAY FROM THE COUNTER . OPEN THE DOORS . PUT YOUR HANDS UP ON THE WINDOWS ! NOW ! NOW ! DO IT ! YOU ! HERE ! GET DOWN ! NOW ! ON THE FLOOR ! - NOBODY MOVE ! - TWO MINUTES ! LET 'S OPEN IT . OPEN IT ! DON 'T MOVE ! - I GOT IT . - [ Gunshot ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Woman Sobbing ] OH , MY GOD ! IS HE DEAD ? NO . HE 'S STILL ALIVE . FINISH HIM ! ONE MINUTE , THIRTY . [ Whimpers ] YOU ! FACE DOWN , ON THE FLOOR ! RIGHT HERE ! NOW ! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ? DO IT ! GET DOWN ! [ Man Whimpering ] I TOLD YOU TO FINISH HIM . FINISH HIM ! THAT WEAPON 'S TRACEABLE . GO . [ Gunshot ] [ Screaming ] GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE . GO ! GO ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? THE BILLS COULD BE TRACED . THE BANK HEIST WAS A DECOY ... TO CONTAMINATE THE MONEY YOU DIDN 'T TAKE . NO MORE TESTS , MR. MULDER . THIS IS THE REAL DEAL . YOU 'VE BEEN A BIG HELP . PUT THAT DOWN . HE 'S A LIABILITY . TO WHO ? YOU ? IF YOU THINK YOU 'RE GONNA KILL MULDER TO PROTECT YOUR SECRET , IT 'S TOO LATE . I ALREADY KNOW YOUR SECRET . AGENT MULDER PROVIDED US WITH F.B.I. SURVEILLANCE REPORTS , FILES WHICH CONTAINED A NAME , A SOURCE WHO 'S BEEN LEAKING INFORMATION ON US FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS . CHARLES BOGARD . SEE , BOGARD IS AN ALIAS , AN OLD ONE , FOR AUGUST BREMER . AGENT MULDER KNOWS MY ALIAS , JUST AS HE KNEW A FALSE REPORT WOULD FEED YOUR AMBITION AND PIT YOU AGAINST ME . MULDER RISKED HIS LIFE FOR US . ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT ? [ Mulder ] THEY 'RE TESTING ME TOO . [ Continues On Tape ] HALEY 'S PARANOID , SPOOKED . I WAS SURE HE WAS GONNA KILL ME . [ Scully ] WHAT STOPPED HIM ? HE STILL NEEDS SOMETHING FROM ME . I 'M SENSING THERE 'S SOMEONE HALEY TRUSTS EVEN LESS . WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ? DIRECTOR SKINNER , YOU 'VE GOT TO GET TO MULDER . YOU 'VE GOTTA FIND THE BANK THEY HIT . THAT 'S WHAT WE 'RE TRYING TO DO . AGENT MULDER 'S LIFE IS IN DANGER , AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO TOUCHES THE CURRENCY AT THAT LOCATION . THEY 'RE PUTTING THE BIOTOXIN ON THE MONEY . [ Skinner ] WE 'VE GOT NO WAY OF CONTACTING HIM . NOT WITHOUT BLOWING HIS COVER . YOU 'VE GOT NO CHOICE . WE HAD SURVEILLANCE TAPES SATELLITED TO US . THERE HAVE BEEN 27 ROBBERIES IN SEVEN EASTERN STATES , ALL THIS MORNING . NO SIGN OF MULDER . WELL , HE 'S GOTTA BE ON THERE SOMEWHERE . [ Bremer ] WE HAVE MADE SOME DECISIONS . TAKE IT AND GET OUT OF HERE . I DON 'T WANNA SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN . GO . - ON YOUR FEET . - I DON 'T NEED A CAR . YOU CAN JUST CALL ME A CAB . - LET 'S GO . - GO WHERE ? [ Grunts ] WITNESSING THE MURDER OF A FEDERAL AGENT WILL MAKE THESE MEN AN ACCESSORY TO THE CRIME . DID YOU HEAR THAT ? I WOULDN 'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD . [ Bremer ] STOP THERE . DOWN ON YOUR KNEES . HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK . [ Pistol Chamber Clicks , Gunshot ] [ Sighs ] THERE 'S A CAR FOR YOU JUST OVER THE RISE . HEAD SOUTH TILL YOU GET TO THE HIGHWAY . WHO ARE YOU ? GO ON . THEY COME OUT HERE AND FIND US , THEY 'LL KILL US BOTH . [ Whispers ] GO . HEY ! HOLD IT ! HOLD IT ! WHO ARE YOU ? F.B.I. WHO 'S IN CHARGE ? WHO 'S IN CHARGE ? I NEED EVERYBODY OUT OF THE BANK . - MULDER ! - THEY SPRAYED THE MONEY ! WE GOT HERE AN HOUR AGO , BEFORE ANY OF THE FUNDS WERE TOUCHED OR TRANSFERRED . THE CASH SUPPLY IS BEING ISOLATED , IT 'S BEING LOCKED DOWN IN THE VAULT . [ Dispatcher On Radio ] CODE 415 . HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS THIS BANK ? I RECOGNIZED YOU FROM THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE . YOUR FINGER . AUGUST BREMER , OR WHATEVER HIS REAL NAME IS ? HE 'S WORKING WITH US . BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER , YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE BIOTOXIN THEY USED ... MAY HAVE COME FROM GOVERNMENT LABS . OURGOVERNMENT . YOU 'RE SAYING I WAS SET UP ? YOU HAVE NO DEFINITIVE INFORMATION TO JUSTIFY THAT POSITION . I WAS BEING USED ? THIS WHOLE OPERATION ? THE PEOPLE THAT DIED IN THAT THEATER ? AGENT MULDER . OUR GOVERNMENT IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS . THE HELL THEY AREN 'T . THOSE WERE TESTS ON US TO BE USED ON SOMEONE ELSE . THOSE BILLS HAVE BEEN ANALYZED . THE MONEY IN THE VAULT GAVE NO READINGS . THERE 'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF ANY BIOTOXINS . SO BEFORE YOU CLIMB ON ANY BANDWAGON- - YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS ALL ALONG . YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS THE WHOLE TIME ! I WANT THAT MONEY RECHECKED . THAT MONEY HAS BEEN CLEARED . IT 'S BEING USED AS EVIDENCE IN A FEDERAL CRIME . THAT MONEY 'S AS DIRTY AS YOU ARE , ISN 'T IT ? ISN 'T IT ? SAY THAT WERE TRUE . THEN WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH , AGENT MULDER , AS A WHISTLE-BLOWER ? TO MOBILIZE A CIVIL RIGHTS ACTION ? TO BRING DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ? TO DO THE VERY WORK THAT THAT GROUP YOU WERE A PART OF IS SO BENT ON DOING ? WHATDOYOU WANT ? LAWS AGAINST THOSE MEN , OR LAWS PROTECTING THEM ? I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH . WELL , SOMETIMES OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE FROM KNOWING IT . EXCUSE ME . [ Horn Blaring ] [ Horn Continues Blaring ] [ Child ] I MADE THIS .

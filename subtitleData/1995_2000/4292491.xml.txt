Swing it in here . - Strike ! - In what league ? Quit complaining . We already had to move home plate ' cause you bitched about the mud . [ Fielder ] Nice pitch . Come on , let him hear some chin music . Throw a fast ball ! [ Grunts ] Whoa . - Nice hit . - Go get it ! - Hey , come on ! - It went on the Peacock 's property . Here 's another one ! [ pitcher ] Come on , let 's play ! Come on , baby , bring it home to mama . Right here . Put it there . Come on , right here . Come on , baby . Bring it home . Come on , right here . That 's it . Ease up . Come on . [ Fielder ] Get to it . Compression marks indicate the shovel blade ... to be approximately six and three-quarters inches . The angle of movement and deeper indentation on the right side of the mark ... suggests a left-handed individual . I 've collected soil specimens , and , uh , although numerous shoe impressions remain from the sandlot game , I think a couple of dental stone casts will prove invaluable ... to the investigation . Meanwhile , I 've quit the F.B.I. and become a spokesperson for the Ab-Roller . Smell that . It 's perfume . Eau de ball . God , this brings back a lot of memories of my sister- - all day pickup games out on the vineyard , ride your bikes down to the beach , eat bologna sandwiches . Only place you had to be on time was home for dinner . Never had to lock your doors . No modems , no faxes , no cell phones . Mulder , if you had to do without a cell phone for two minutes , you 'd lapse into catatonic schizophrenia . Scully , you don 't know me as well as you think you do . My work demands that I live in a big ciry , but if I settle down , build a home , it 'll be a place like this . - It 'd be like living in Mayberry . - [ Truck Door Closes ] Agents Mulder and Scully ? Hi . - I 'm Sheriff Andy Taylor . - For real ? Can 't thank you or the bureau enough for coming out . It 's just me and my deputy , and- - Hell , we never had anything of this nature . Do you have any thoughts or suspects ? Population of Home is only a few hundred . Everybody knows everybody pretty much . Were there any local women who were pregnant and now suddenly aren 't ? No . I just saw Mary Ellen and Nancy . - They 're both fine . - Hey , Sheriff , who lives in that house there ? - They 're both fine . - Hey , Sheriff , who lives in that house there ? Did you question them ? They 've been watching us the entire time . That farm belongs to the Peacock family . Three boys now- - Well , men . Guess you could call them human . Their folks were in a bad car wreck . We suppose they died . - You suppose ? - We tried to administer medical attention , but the boys hauled the bodies away , took them home . They haven 't been seen in ten years , so ... we suppose they died . Have you questioned the men ? The Peacocks built that farm during the Civil War . It still has no electriciry , no running water , no heat . They grow their own food . They raise their own pigs . They breed their own cows . Raise and breed their own stock , if you get my meaning . It is , however , the closest residence to the crime scene . Those boys are feeble , Agent Scully , and sad . They wouldn 't have any idea what you were talking about . - They could have witnessed- - - Look , this town is my home . I love it . It 's quiet ... peaceful . I don 't even wear a gun . I 've seen and heard some of the sick ... and horrible things that go on outside my Home . At the same time , I knew we couldn 't stay hidden forever , that one day the modern world would find us ... and my hometown would change forever . And when I saw ... it ... in the ground , I knew that day had come . Now I want to find whoever did this . But in doing so , I 'd like it if the way things are around here didn 't have to change . I know this is iffy bureau jurisdiction , but I didn 't know where else to turn . So I called the bureau in Pittsburgh , and when I described the victim , they said I should see you . Maybe we should take a look at the victim then . We don 't have a lab or a morgue . I 've got a room down here , might be a bit cleaner . By the way , this is my deputy , Barney . - Fife ? - Pastor . [ phone Ringing ] I could use a bit more elbow room . The thing is , see , folks have been dropping in to ask about the case , and I wouldn 't want anybody to pop in and see this . You could just lock the door to the office . Folks know I never lock the door . They 'd start rumors . has been afflicted by every rare birth defect known to science . I mean , I 'm going to have to order DNA typing from the crime lab , but there appears to be abnormalities associated with ... Neu-Laxova syndrome , Meckel-Gruber syndrome , atrophy of the cloaca . I don 't even know where to begin . I guess we can rule out murder as the cause of death , huh ? I don 't know about that . There 's evidence of occlusion due to dirt in the nose and mouth , indicating the dirt has been inhaled . There 's something rotten in Mayberry . Imagine all a woman 's hopes and dreams for her child ... and then nature turns so cruel . What must a mother go through ? Apparently not much in this case , if she 'd just throw it out with the trash . I-l guess I wasjust projecting on myself . - Why , is there a history of genetic abnormalities in your family ? - No . Well , just find yourself a man with a spotless genetic makeup ... and a really high tolerance for being second-guessed ... and start pumping out the little Uber-Scullys . - What abour your family ? - Hmm ? Well , aside from the need for corrective lenses ... and a tendency to be abducted by extraterrestrials ... involved in an international governmental conspiracy , the Mulder family passes genetic muster . Scully , that child inside is a tragedy . Some young parents , probably scared kids , disposed of an unwanted birth . In a very certain sense , infanticide is involved , but this is not an F.B.I. matter . But from what I know about genetic defects , Mulder , it 's unlikely that child is the result ofa single polygenic mating . We should let local authorities investigate that . Those defects , Mulder , are autosomal-dominant disorders , and from the degree , I 'd say , mutations that go back many generations . Scully , Sheriff Taylor implied that the boys in that family ... were not really the type that could easily get dates . But he also implied that they practice inbreeding . Now , we all have a natural instinct to propagate- - Do we ? There are theories which pose that our bodies are ... simply vehicles for genes needing to replicate . Yeah , but there 's no sister . The mother 's been dead for ten years . But if that instinct and the need is strong enough , they will answer it anyway that they can . Now , a woman gave birth to that child , Mulder , and , my guess is , against her will . And kidnapping is a bureau matter . Scully ... I never saw you as a mother before . [ Fly Buzzing ] No , there 's no probable cause . [ Scully ] They match . - This room alone should convict them . - Yeah , if we can find them . They probably bolted when they saw us coming . We 'll alert Sheriff Taylor to issue a warrant for the brothers ' arrest , put out a counry-wide A.P.B. And check any prior missing persons for a woman ... and check the vehicle identification number on that Cadillac . If the mother 's alive , they probably took her with them . [ Raspy Breathing ] I 've issued descriptions and arrest warrants for George Raymond Peacock , approximate age : 30 , Sherman Nathaniel Peacock , approximate age : 26 , and Edmund Creighton Peacock , 42 . What about missing persons reports ? Depury Pastor 's on it right now . Do you recall over the last eight to ten months ... any vehicles you found and considered to be abandoned , but which might actually belong to kidnap victims ? We saw a white Cadillac in the Peacocks ' front yard . We get so many of those , Agent Scully . A car breaks down , people move on . Well , we 'll check on those in the morning . You get some sleep , Sheriff . You too , Miss Scully . Good night . [ Sighs ] Whoa ! Don 't move , don 't move . Damn . You still planning on making a home here ? Not if I can 't get the Knicks game . Just as long as a brutal infanticide doesn 't weigh into your decision . - Good night , Mulder . - Good night , Mom . Mulder , this lock is broken .

I , uh- - I came over to give him these reports and , uh ... and found them . The , uh ... owner of the Cadillac was- - was found and contacted in Baltimore . She ran out of gas and just left the car on the 119 . Other , uh ... possible missing persons are in the file ... and , uh ... this came from the federal crime lab overnight . - Where are they ? - They 're , uh ... inside . His chest is one big hematoma . There 's wood shavings embedded in what 's left of the cranium . They really went caveman on them . Damn it . The lab screwed up the DNA test on the infant . Multiple maldistribution , chromosomal breakage , maldivision of the centromere . You expected these abnormalities . Yeah , but this shows far too many gene imbalances . It would have to be a lab error . This child 's cells would have had to divide triple-fold in cell metaphase . Triple ? Hey , Scully , what if each of the Peacock brothers was the father of that child ? Only one sperm in thousands from a single individual can penetrate an ovum membrane , let alone from three separate males . What if generations of autosomal breeding could produce such a mutation ? No , for that to even be remotely possible , there would have to be a weakening of the ovum , and that would have to come from a female member of the Peacock family , and there aren 't any left . Well , in any case , they haven 't ventured too far from home . We should request backups from Pittsburgh and go pick them up . That would take a whole day . I think they may have a woman captive up there ... who may have sustained life-threatening injuries while giving birth . Who knows what those men have done to her . I think we should go there now . Yeah , but we 're outnumbered . We could further endanger the victim by doing that . I 'll take you out there . Then it 's three against three . And this- - This should give us the advantage . That was just a little bit too Chuck Bronson for me . Hang on a second . Why- - Why would the Peacocks kill Sheriff Taylor ? He didn 't even question them about a buried child . They probably heard about the warrants issued for their arrest . But how would they know ? He issued the warrants by phone . Unless they overheard us talking about it , how would they know ? We searched that house , Scully . They weren 't home . Exactly . How could they know ? [ Snorting ] I 'm hungry . [ Flies Buzzing ] [ Regurgitating ] All right . I 'm ready . You look fine . They 'll be coming now . We knew this day was gonna happen . That they 'd try to change the way things are . All we can do about changing things ... is be ready for it , be ready for them . - [ Fly Buzzing ] - Let them know ... this is our home ... and this is the way it 's gonna stay . [ Scully ] Yep , they 're up there . I 'll take the front . Their attention will be taken by the uniform . You two can approach around back . Are these vests absolutely necessary , Deputy ? I 've seen them fire muskets before . I , for one , am not getting taken out by some antique . This is Pastor . I 'm at the front of the house . We 're getting into position . - I don 't see anybody inside . - I 'm going in . - Pastor , no ! - [ Screams ] Pastor 's dead . The brothers moved in like a pack of animals . The eldest will move in to assure the prey has been killed . Encircling the prey is a signal to the others that it 's safe to approach . What we 're witnessing is un diluted animal behavior . Mankind- - absent its own creation ... of civilization , technology and information , regressed to an almost prehistoric state , obeying only the of ten savage laws of nature . We 're outsiders invading the den , trying to take away ... their one chance at reproducing , which we 're gonna do . Even though we have the firearms , I imagine the place is rigged with traps . Yeah , but we can try to divert them out of the house . Scully , would you think less of me as a man ... if I told you I was kind of excited right now ? Is there some secret farmer trick to getting these things moving ? I don 't know . Nah-ram-ewe . [ Bleating ] Nah-ram-ewe . Yeah , that 'll work . I baby-sat my nephew this weekend . He watches Babe 15 times a day . - And people call me Spooky . - [ DoorOpens ] Federal agents ! ls anybody in here ? F.B.I. ! ls anybody in this house ? Is there anybody in here ? Oh , no . [ Squeaking ] - No ! Get out of here ! Go away ! - It 's all right , ma 'am . - We 're federal agents . We 're here to help you . - Get out ! Go away ! - Go away ! Get away ! - Let 's move the bed . - Get away ! Get away ! - They 've got her strapped to some kind of board or something . [ Woman Continues Screaming ] Take it easy , ma 'am . It 's all right . It 's all over . - [ Crying Hysterically ] - We 're from the F.B.I. We 're here to help . We 're gonna make sure that you 're safe . - [ Woman Sobbing ] - We 're gonna make sure that you get home . [ Crying Continues ] Mulder , she already is home . It 's Mrs. peacock . She 's their mother . [ Hisses ] [ Yelling ] [ Yelling Continues ] [ Sobbing ] [ pigs Grunting ] [ Scully ] Mulder , where are you going ? The others may have heard the screams . I 'm going to check on their position . What about her ? She 's not gonna go anywhere . We may not be able to remove her , Mulder . She doesn 't appear to be held against her will . I mean , she appears to be , but I don 't believe she is . I 'm sure she 's an accessory . At least she aided and abetted . We 're only assuming . We can 't prove anything . The way I think it goes here ... is that Edmund is the brother and father of the other two . Which means that when Edmund was a kid , he could ground the other two for playing with his things ? The brothers killed three people , Scully . Tell her we 're gonna bring them in , and try convincing her ... that she 's the one way they can get out of this without any of her boys getting hurt . All right , I 'm gonna keep an eye on them . Scully , watch your step . This place is rigged . Mrs. Peacock ? Mrs. Peacock , you are in immediate need of medical attention . Agent Mulder and I are here to help you . This is our home . Why leave it ? - Whatever pain you may be in- - - Don 't feel pain . Runs in the family . Have to check the boys , see if they hurt themselves . What about you ? Even after the accident ? Right arm was torn off . Saw it sitting there across my dead husband 's lap . Boys took me home ... sewed me up just like the family learnt ... in the War of Northern Aggression . Whole time , felt the same as if been making breakfast . They 're such good boys . Mrs. Peacock , they murdered Sheriff Taylor and his wife and Deputy Pastor . I can tell you don 't have no children . Maybe one day you 'll learn the pride ... the love ... when you know your boy will do anything for his mother . Scully . Federal agent ! I 'm armed ! - Stop or I 'll fire ! [ Grunting ] Mulder ! [ Glass Shatters ] I 've got the mother ! [ Yelling ] - [ Glass Shattering ] - [ Grunting ] - [ Fires Gun ] [ Brother Groans ] Where 's the other brother ? Edmund ? Mulder , look . Marks on the floor . - All right , thank you . - I looked everywhere . They 're both gone . I 've notified the state police and the highway patrol . They 've put out an A.P.B. on the Peacocks ... and are setting up a road block over a 30-mile radius . In time , we 'll catch them . I think time already caught them , Scully . # # [ Mrs. peacock ] There , there . Sherman and George were good boys . We should be proud . And you got to know , Edmund , you can 't keep a peacock down . There 'll be more . One day , there 'll be more . Now we have to move on ... start a new family , ; one we 'll be proud of . Find a new place to call ours , ; a new home , a brand-new home .

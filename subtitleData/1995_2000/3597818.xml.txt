 [ Footsteps approaching ] [ Car door opens ] Okay , sweetheart . We 're just going in for a few things . We won 't be long . Okay , Polly ? Mommy needs some groceries , okay ? I don 't like this store , mommy . We 're only gonna be a minute . I wanna go home . [ Doll ] let 's have fun . Help , Melissa . [ Woman gasping ] We 're going home , Polly . Please , don 't do this to mommy . [ Glass shatters ] [ Clattering ] [ Sobbing ] [ Customers crying out ] [ Groans ] [ People groaning , shouting ] It 's Dave down at the supr savr . Send whoever you got on duty . I want to play . [ Grunts ] [ Screaming ] [ Bell dinging ] [ Phone ringing ] [ Ringing continues ] Scully . Hey , Scully , it 's me . Mulder , I thought we had an agreement . We were both gonna take the weekend off . Right . Right , I know . But-But I-I just received ... Some information about- - About a case . A classic x-Files . Classic . I wanted to share it with you . Mulder , I 'm on vacation . The weather is clear . I 'm looking forward to hitting the road and breathing in some of this fine new England air . - You didn 't rent a convertible , did you ? - Why ? Are you aware of the statistics of decapitation ? Mulder , I 'm hanging up . I 'm turning off my cell phone . I 'm back in the office on Monday . You shouldn 't talk and drive at the same time , either . Are you aware of the statistics- - Hello ? [ Line disconnects ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Tires screeching ] Sir ? Sir , what happened ? I-I think we need a doctor . [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing continues ] who are you ? I 'm- - My name is Scully . I 'm- - I 'm an F.B.I. Agent . What happened to you ? I-I don 't know . But Dave , the butcher- - I think he 's dead . [ Panting ] [ Man , woman moaning on TV ] [ Phone ringing ] Mulder . [ Scully ] Mulder , it 's me . [ Moaning continues ] I thought you were on vacation . I am . I 'm up in Maine . I thought you said you didn 't want to be disturbed . You wanted to get out of your head for a few days . I don 't . I mean , I do . I- - [ Moaning continues ] What are you watching , Mulder ? It 's the " world 's most deadliest swarms . " Um- - You said you were gonna be unreachable . What 's going on ? I , uh- - I 'm at a market here . I 'm just trying to give the local P.D. A handle here . A handle on what ? Well , I 'm not quite sure how to describe it , Mulder . I didn 't witness it myself , but there seems to be some kind ... Of an outbreak of people acting in a violent , involuntary way . - Towards who ? - Toward themselves . Themselves ? Yeah . Beating at their faces , clawing at their eyes . One man is dead . Dead how ? Self-Inflicted , it appears . Huh . It sounds to me like that 's , uh , witchcraft ... Or maybe some sorcery that you 're looking for there . No , I don 't think it 's witchcraft , Mulder , or sorcery . I 've had a look around , and I don 't see any evidence ... Of anything that warrants that kind of suspicion . Maybe you don 't know what you 're looking for . Like evidence of conjury or the black arts or shamanism , Divination , Wicca or any kind of pagan or neo-Pagan practice , Charms , cards , familiars , bloodstones or hex signs ... Or any of the ritual tableau associated ... With the occult , Santeria , voudom , macumba or any high or low magic . - Scully ? - Yes ? Marry me . I was hoping for something a little more helpful . Short of looking for a lady wearing a pointy hat , riding a broomstick , I think you 've pretty much got it covered there . Thanks anyway . - Who 's that woman right there ? - Melissa Turner . She 's the only one I 've seen who looks unaffected . What 's your point ? You might want to talk to her . Ms. Scully . You staying in town ? Yes . I 'm on vacation . Why ? What you said back there about Melissa Turner ... Kind of put a spin on this whole business here today . How 's that ? Well , Melissa 's caused some stir . People here say she 's a witch . It 's not the first time for that accusation in these parts . Uh , yeah . To be honest with you , captain Bonsaint , um , I 'm not much of a believer in witchcraft . You know , I 'm not either . I used to just think it 's ' cause Melissa was pretty and single . Threatenin ' , you know ? But now you 're not convinced ? Well , you know , I appreciate the trouble you went to , And I sure do hope there 's a reasonable explanation , like you said . Just this one thing gonna make it hard to persuade folks to your thinkin ' . What one thing is that ? Who she 's been carrying on with . " Who she 's been carrying on with " ? Uh , yeah . With Dave , the butcher . [ Melissa ] hello ? Hey , it 's Buddy . Oh , hi . Are you okay , Melissa ? I 'm fine . Why do you ask ? Who 's that , mommy ? ? [ " Hokey pokey " on record player ] I know you were here , Melissa , down at the supr savr . I don 't know what you 're talking about , Buddy . - Hang up , mommy . - Melissa , Turn the music down . There 's some talk that you 're involved in what happened here today . I 'm not involved in anything . I know that . Would you listen to me ? I-I-I 'm not saying that you are . What are you saying , Buddy ? [ Polly ] mommy ! I want to help you , but you gotta keep it a secret , Or we 're both gonna be answering questions . Now , I got something to tell you . What ? Something bad . What is it , Buddy ? Dave 's dead . Oh , my God ! I gotta see you right away . Melissa- - I can 't . You need a friend more than ever . ? [ Continues ] let 's have fun . You can 't come here , Buddy . Why ? Tell me why . I can 't explain it to you now . I 'm coming over there , Melissa . You shouldn 't be alone . ? You put your backside in ? ? And you shake it all about ? ? ? You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around ? ? ? That 's what it 's all about ? [ Scully ] the back door 's wide open . [ Bonsaint ] Melissa ? The sheets are still wet . Chief ? Take a look at this . What the devil 's this for ? It looks like she was afraid of something . Whatever it is , she 's run off in a hurry . Laundry 's out , door 's unlocked . Beats me . [ Sighs ] You know her ? Melissa Turner ? Mm-Hmm . About as local as you can get . Born and raised here . Married a fisherman . Widowed last year after a boating accident . Don 't know if the little girl , Polly , ever really understood . Toys in the attic . The daughter 's autistic ? That 's what they say . There was the incident last year over at the day care center . Proprietor slapped Polly across the face . Slapped her ? What for ? She said Polly threw a tantrum so fierce , there was nothin ' else she could do . Next thing she knew , she 's on the ground . Little girl knocked her silly . The little girl did ? Well , that 's her story . Polly never touched her as far as I could figure . Oh , it was a real drama , though . The lady who ran the school lost her license . People calling ' the kid all manner of names , sayin ' Melissa 's a witch . Polly never went back to school a day since . This , uh- - This affair that the mother was having with the butcher ? Dave . Oh , I might have given you the wrong impression . That wasn 't really an affair . Although , Dave did make quite a fool of himself and his wife . So , it was unrequited ? You could say that . To the extent that she 'd have to nail a window shut ? Oh , he wasn 't that big a fool . You know , Maybe she wasn 't afraid of somethin ' ... gettin ' in . Maybe she was afraid of somethin ' gettin ' out . Like what ? Just a thought . What do you think of that , huh ? Why don 't you leave town ? I 've got nowhere to go , Buddy . I live on a shoestring as it is . Listen to me . I 've got some money put away . Buddy , I can 't . I 've had my eye on you for more years than I care to remember . I missed my chance the first time around . I 've been waiting in the wings . Now , I 'm sorry about things . Truly I am . But you need somebody who can provide . Don 't , Buddy , please . Don 't because you don 't want to , Or just because you 're too proud ? You don 't understand . What don 't I understand ? What happened in the supr savr , What happened to Dave- - I couldn 't stop it . What do you mean ? I 've seen things . I want more cherries . - What 's that , sweetie ? - I want more cherries . I saw Dave dead ... Before he was dead . I saw him in frozen foods all cut and bloody . And it 's not the first time . My husband- - I saw him ... In a window , dead before it happened . You know , with the hook . You 're gonna have to go ask your mommy for some more money , hon . - I just can 't give them away . - [ Man ] window order . Let 's have fun . Mommy , I want more cherries . We gotta go now , Polly . Take this , Melissa . It 's to a place we use for hunting up near Schoodic lake . Mommy ? Mommy ? Or else there 's gonna be trouble , more than you need . - Mommy ! - [ Screaming ] [ Screaming continues ] Is that you , Jack ? Uh , yeah , it 's me , Jane . Come in ? Who have you got with you ? Ms. Froehlich , my name 's Dana Scully . I 'm with the F.B.I. I just happened to be here on vacation , and , uh- - So ? So , I just- - I 'm helping out the chief here . Did you talk to her ? Who ? Oh , please . Melissa Turner . That whore 's a witch , sure as I 'm standin ' here . She 's descended from the Hawthornes in Salem and the Englishes too . She comes from a cursed lineage , And now she 's passing it on to the whelp . God save that little girl if somebody don 't do somethin ' . Lord knows I tried . Jane , if we could just come in for a few minutes and talk . I found out last year how much good talkin ' to you does , Jack Bonsaint . I explained everything , and the city closed me down anyway . Our great-Great-Grandfathers knew how to treat witches . They would have driven the demon out of that little girl ... And given that slantard of a mother just what she 's got coming . New England hospitality . I 've heard about it my whole life . Finally got a chance to experience it for myself . You see what I 'm up against here , public sentiment and all . This family tree of Melissa Turner 's . Uh , yeah . It 's all talk , isn 't it ? Well , I never really asked . Why ? Well , I think you need to bring her in to straighten this out . Under what pretext ? That she might know something . About what ? Well , about what I 'm sure is a perfectly reasonable explanation for all this . Uh , yeah . I wish I could help you out . You know , I 'm just ... on vacation . [ Car door closes ] [ Engine starts ] Hi . Where are you headed this time of night ? We were invited up to a place near the lake . Uh-Huh . A friend gave us the key . You got gear ? Food and water ? We 'll be all right . I just want to make sure of that , ma 'am . Winter 's in full force up there . Power 's iffy . Just you and the little one ? For now . I wanna go home , mommy . We 're gonna go camping , Polly . I want my bed . I want my records . Let 's have fun . I 'll just take your license number , then . - [ Gasps ] - Help me . Hey ! ? [ Record player ] ? You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around ? ? That 's what it 's all about ? ? Left foot ? ?

I was , uh , a little worried about you . I was wondering if you needed my help up there . Needed your help on what ? I left you a message at the motel . You didn 't get it ? I was up and out this morning . [ Tapping continues ] Mulder ? Yeah ? What 's that noise ? Where are you ? I 'm at home . They 're doing construction right out the window . Hold on a second . Hey , fellas , can you just keep it down for a second maybe ? Thank you ! Yeah , hey , I was thinking about this case . Maybe it 's not witchcraft after all . Maybe there 's a scientific explanation . " A scientific explanation " ? Yeah , a medical cause . Something called chorea . Dancing sickness . Yeah , St. Vitus 's dance . It affects groups of people , Causing unexplained outbursts of , uh , uncontrollable jerks and spasms . Yeah , and it hasn 't been seen or diagnosed since the middle ages . Mmm . [ Groans ] You 're obviously not a fan of American bandstand , Scully . Mulder ? Thanks for the help . Yeah ? [ Line disconnects ] hello ? That your partner ? Yep .

[ Turns off ] You know , chief Bonsaint- - Um , Jack- - Can I call you Jack ? I 've been thinking that maybe- - Maybe we need to explore other possibilities . I 'm not sure I understand .

Ah . Oh , my God ! [ Sighs ] That looks like something out of Jules Verne . We 're supposed to eat that ? A little late for anything else . Now , you said you had some other directions you were lookin ' at ? I 've been thinking about Melissa Turner . Now , you said that her husband died in a boating accident ? Uh , yep . Well , was there anything strange about that ? About the way that it happened ? Well , it was never quite explained to anyone 's satisfaction , actually . - How 's that ? - How the man got a grappling hook ... Poked clean through his skull . Was Melissa ever questioned about that ? Melissa ? No , I don 't see how she 'd be involved . The boat he died on is right over there , if you 're at all wondering ' . I saw that man in the market . I want popcorn , mommy . ? Okay . ? ? You put your right foot in you put your right foot out ? ? You put your right foot in ? [ Gasps ] What are you doin ' here ? Buddy . How come you 're back in town ? You 've gotta get outta here . I called the rangers . They said you tried to kill a man . You almost ran him over . You came back here to kill her too , didn 't you ? I didn 't try to kill anybody . Jane Froehlich . It isn 't me , Buddy . Yeah , well , we 're gonna see about that . You 're coming with me . ? That 's what it 's all about right arm ? ? ?

[ Seagulls cawing ] [ ship horn blaring in distance ] " What happened ? " You ask that question around here , you get as many stories as- - As fishermen . You were on board the night that he died . What do you think ? I told my story to the chief . People 's stories change . [ Sighs ] folks blame the widow . Who do you blame ? He was wild for her . He worked very hard to build that little house for her . When that daughter came , you needed a mop to wipe the smile off his face . We 'd set out to sea on the girl 's last birthday . He was counting the hours before he 'd be home again . Hey , look what Davy Jones sent my little Polly . Catch of the day . [ Chuckles ] Yeah . Three days later ... He was dead . And you know what killed him . The eyes play tricks at night . Water up against the hull making noises . Sometimes you hear things . [ Doll ] let 's have fun . What the hell was that ? [ Door opens ] What is it ? [ Door closes ] [ Doll ] I want to play . [ Gasps ] oh , my God ! Like I said , the eyes play tricks . But you saw something ... In that grocery store . That little girl and her dolly . The moment I saw them ... I knew . [ Phone ringing ] - Scully . - Oh , hey . I- - - I thought you weren 't answering your cell phone . - Then why 'd you call ? I , uh- - I had a new thought about this case you 're working on . There 's a viral infection that 's spread by simple touch . Mulder , are there any references in occult literature ... To objects that have the power to direct human behavior ? What types of objects ? Um , like a doll , for instance . - You mean like chucky ? - Yeah , kind of like that . Well , yeah , the talking doll myth is well established in literature , Especially in New England . The fetish- - Or juju- - Is believed to pass on magical powers on to its possessor . Some of the early witches were condemned ... For little more than proclaiming that these objects existed . The supposed witch having premonitory visions and things- - Why do you ask ? I was just curious . You didn 't find a talking doll , did you , Scully ? No . No , of course not . Uh- - I would suggest that you check the back of the doll for a- - A plastic ring with a string on it . That would be my first- - Hello ? [ Line disconnects ] Let 's go talk to Melissa Turner . [ Scraping sounds ] [ Shouting ] where 's my popcorn ? It 's coming , Polly . [ Scraping sounds continue ] Where 's my popcorn ? It 's coming . [ Hammering ] [ Polly ] mommy . I can 't sleep . You go back to bed , Polly . It 's way past your bedtime . No more pounding . Go back to bed , sweetheart . - Let 's have fun . - [ Gasps ] Help me . Everything 's gonna be all right , sweetie .

Don 't play with matches . You go back to bed , Polly ! [ Knocking continues ] Melissa ! Go on now ! [ Knocking continues ] [ Scully ] Melissa ! Melissa ! Bonsaint ! Don 't play with knives . Mommy ? She 's got the door nailed shut . She 's trying to kill herself . [ Pounding on window ] Melissa ! Mommy ! Mommy , no more pounding ! Let 's play with the hammer . [ Scully ] Melissa !

Oh , I got it down on " m " street at some head shop about five years ago . Hmm . Why ? No , I just ... wanted to send one to somebody . You do ? Mm-Hmm . Who ? [ Clears throat ] - Who ? - Oh , just ... Some guy . Jack . " M " street ? Yeah . Does this have something to do with that case you were working on ? What case ? Uh , yeah . Yes , it does . - Did you solve it ? - Me ? No . No , I was- - I was on vacation . Just ... getting out of my own head for a few days . What about you ? Did you , um , get anything done while I was gone ? Oh , God , it 's amazing what I can accomplish without incessant meddling ... Or questioning into everything I do . It 's just- - There 's ... got to be an explanation . Oh , I don 't know . I think some things are better left unexplained . Hmm . I want to play . [ Child ] I made this !

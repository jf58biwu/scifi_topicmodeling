 ( KRYTEN ) Last week on Red Dwarf ( SQUEALS ) something terrible happened to Mr Lister 's armI Watch thisI Hey , guys , check this out ! There 's a woman in there ! I 've been tongue-hockeyed to death ! You know how you told us to find a solution , however drastic ? What have you got , Kryts ? My left arm , I said ! What kind of navigation officer can 't tell left from right ? - We did our best . I am so sorry . - Mr Lister , you 're awake ! Buddy , you look great ! ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) ( TUNELESS STRUMMING ) Oh , bravo , sir ! There 's no need for despondency . You can still play the guitar ! Yeah , look on the bright side . At least now I 'm only half crap . - We should still count our blessings . - Kryten 's right . You may have lost a limb , but countless people have lost an arm and gone on to lead a perfectly " normal " life . - Like who ? - Oh , there are thousands , sir . - Thousands upon thousands . - Like ? - More than thousands . - Who ? - Millions ! - Who ? - Well , I can 't name them all individually . - Name one . One ? Hmm ... As many as that ? - Lord Nelson . He beat the French . - Thank you , ma 'am . - He beat the French . - Who else ? - Well , er ... - The Venus de Milo . The Venus de Milo . No arms at all , but that didn 't prevent her from pursuing a successful modelling career . - Go on . - Go on ? You said there were millions . That 's two , and one 's a statue . Name five . Five ? Right . Well , there 's , um ... There 's Lord Nelson , and , er ... Ms de Milo , and then there 's the ... well ... - Help us ! Er , the ... - The painter dude ! - What painter dude ? - The Welsh guy . You know ? The one with one arm . Van Gogogogh . He had one ear . He cut the other one off . - He did ? - Yes . See ? He manages to cut off his own ear with one arm , and you 're worried . There must be more ... That guy from " The Fugitive " . What was his name ? - The One-Armed Man . - That 's him ! That 's three . He was a murderer . He killed Richard Kimble 's wife . But that proves my point . If that guy can murder an able-bodied woman minus a major extremity , then you 've got nothing to worry about . Let 's face it , guys . There aren 't any noteworthy one-armed people . - You can 't even name five . - Of course we can ! Horatio Nelson , the one-armed guy from " The Fugitive " , the Venus de Milo , Van Gogh and ... one more ... That Mexican dude ! - The one who robbed people ! - What one ? The one-armed bandit ! That 's a machine , you gimp ! One of the most popular pub games of the 20th century . And it only had one arm ? What a heart-warming story . - Dave Lister . There . That 's five . - I 'm going to the loo . I don 't need to , but as it takes 45 minutes to undo my flies , I should make a start . Do you need a hand ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean ... Sorry . Sorry . Sorry ! Sorry ! Sorry ... - Biscuit , sir ? - Please . - Another bik-bik ? - Yes , please . - Kryten ? What are you doing ? - I 'm just dunking bikkies , ma 'am . It 's another of life 's joys of which Mr Lister has been robbed . Right , sir ? Could you tweak my nose ? I 've got an itch . Itch it yourself . You 've still got one arm . - There . Is that better , sir ? - Yeah , a bit . Kryten , I told you - he wants to be independent . He doesn 't need you treating him like an invalid . - But he does , he does ! Don 't you , sir ? - ( SIGHS ) - Another slurp , sir ? - This is making me sick . Take no notice of her , sir . It 's nearly suppertime . Chuckie-eggs tonight , sir , with your toast cut up into little , tiny , weeny , bite-sized soldiers of varying ranks . - I can cut up my own toast . - Just like you asked for . - Asked for ? - Now , just remember , sir , Kryten knows best ! I 'm gonna stretch me legs , take a walk around the ship . Just opening the door , sir . There we go . Door 's open , sir . - Cheers . - Just closing the door now , sir . The door 's closing , sir . The door 's nearly closed . It 's closed , sir . Florence Nightingdroid , could I have a word ? Certainly , ma 'am . Look , deep down I 'm a big softie . When I saw " Gone With The Wind " , I went through a box of tissues . " ' Now , Voyager " , I couldn 't speak for 20 minutes . I 'll make a note , ma 'am . " Now Voyager " . Worth keeping on stand-by . Carry on , ma 'am ! I 'm saying I 'm not a heartless bitch , so understand that what I 'm about to say isn 't easy . Back off Lister . Let him learn to cope on his own . - I don 't understand , ma 'am . - By helping him , you 're not helping him . Without me , he wouldn 't be wearing underpants ! Have you ever heard of something called " tough love " ? - Does it involve dressing up ? - No . Sometimes , to help a person , you have to get tough , make them stand on their own two feet - or in Lister 's case , one hand ! I see . So you think he should brush his own teeth . I do . It 's time you built him an artificial arm so he 's not so dependant on you . I was getting around to that , but being on 24-hour wipe alert , I haven 't had time ! Wipe alert ? No , don 't even tell me what that means . I think I know , and it 's the grossest thing ! I help him get rid of the crumbs around his mouth . Yeah , that 's what I thought , and it 's absolutely gross . Mouth crumbs . Eurgh ! Disgusting ! It 's a real sonofabitch about your arm , bud . Losing an arm , that is one terrible thing . - Your move . - Can you imagine that ? One minute , you got two arms , and the next - zing ... doof ! - You got one . Hoo-ee ! That 's tough . Your move . And we must need two arms . That 's why we got two arms . Well , except you . Your move . You 're probably wondering , " Is it going to affect my life ? " I think the answer is , " Yes , it is . " Your smegging move . If it were me , I couldn 't survive . I 'd climb to the top of my tallest platform boots and leap to my death . - I couldn 't stand not being perfect . - Your move . But with you I think it 's different . Take a pit bull , a real ugly sonofabitch . It loses its leg somehow and says to you , " Hey , man ! I 've only got three legs . " Will lady pit bulls still like me ? " You 've gotta stop from laughing , haven 't you ? He 's ugly with four legs ! He 's ugly with three ! Hell , he 'd be ugly in a suit with a carnation . So here 's something that 's gonna cheer you up ! It 's your move . - Mr Pit Bull ? Put it there , buddy ! - MOVE ! OK , OK . I 'm going ! I don 't think you 've been listening to a thing I 've said . Now , this is the standard model from the 21st century . Comfortable , sir ? - It 's fine , yeah . - OK , now let 's recap - the limb is connected to neurons on the left hemisphere of your brain , which controls the right side of your body . You merely command the arm to do something , and it obeys . Now , let 's practise . Right , concentrate , sir . I want you to think , " Arm , pick up the ball . " OK ? Now just think , " I will pick up the ball . " - I will pick up the ball . - Good . Concentrate . - I will pick up the ball . - OK , now really think , - " Hand ... " - I will pick up the ball . - That 's right . - Hand , pick up the ball . - " Hand , pick up the ball ! " - Hand , pick up the ball ! - Keep going . - Pick up the ball ! - Now focus onto that . - Pick up the ball ! " Hand , pick up the ball ! " That 's right , sir . Really think , now . " Hand , pick up the ball ! " Really get it going , sir ! " Pick up the ball ! Hand , pick up the ball ! " Really start to move it now , sir ! " Hand , pick up the ball ! " Keep going , sir ! You CAN do it ! " Hand , pick up the ball ! " You 're going to move it ! Move that hand , sir ! Pick up the ball ! Yes , sir ! We 've got some movement , sir ! Yes ! The finger is moving ! Yes ! Oh ! Bravo , sir ! - Oh ! The sweat 's dripping off me ! - Oh , that was fantastic , sir ! - It worked like a dream ! - Is that it ? - Sir ? - Is that the best it works ? To pick up a ball , I need the morning off . It was a tad slow , I 'm forced to admit . The only thing that picks up slower is Rimmer in a disco . Maybe if I adjust the impulse valve , it might make it a little more sensitive . OK , let 's try again . " Hand , pick up the ball . " OK . Hand , pick up the ball . ( CLUNK ) OK . Right . Well , er , let 's try again . - OK ? - Now , " Hand , pick up the ball . " Hand , pick up the ball . I think , sir , the anger inside you is driving the arm . - I don 't feel angry . - You 've lost your arm , sir . - You 've every right to feel angry . - I don 't ! You see , it 's subconscious . You 're thinking , " Hand , pick up the ball , " but your subconscious is saying , " Punch Kryten in the head . " Beat the brains out of the demented droid that cut off my arm . " - Kryten , that 's rubbish ! - ( CLANG ) You 're right ! It 's controlled by my subconscious ! It 's too dangerous to keep that arm , sir . Two minutes with Miss Kochanski and who knows what you 'd be swinging around your head ? There must be a solution to this . Hey , half-eaten-lollipop-head , what about one of your spares ? - Whaddaya say , motherboarder ? - Too heavy , sir . The extra weight would prevent Mr Lister getting it up . He could take it off if he was going on a date . Someone do something to him , ideally involving ice cubes and any puckered body cavity . Wait a minute . Can 't your self-repair system help ? - Ma 'am ? - When you have a mechanical failure , it fixes itself , doesn 't it ? The Kryten back in my dimension had these tiny little robots . Subatomic ? Nanobots . They break objects down into their component atoms , then recombine those atoms to repair damaged circuits . - Nanotechnology . - Just run that by me one more time , but do the big-writing version with pictures , one word a page ? Let me think of a cogent paradigm . I 'd rather have a good example . This is a lead pencil . It 's made of graphite , a particular arrangement of carbon atoms . This is diamond . It too is made of carbon atoms . Nanobots can rearrange atoms so they could take this lead pencil , move the atoms around a bit and turn it into diamond . It 's possible to make diamonds out of pencils ? It 's possible to make computer chips out of sand . So what if we transferred some of your nanobots into Dave ? Could they build him a new arm from excess body tissue ? Unfortunately , ma 'am , it 's not possible , no . - Why not ? - I have no nanobots . They deserted me . - When and where , I can 't be certain . - But if we find them , could they do it ? But finding them would be like looking for a needle in a male student 's flat . - When was the last repair they made ? - On the Esperanto , before the Despair Squid . ( TUTS ) That was before we lost the Dwarf . - That 's why I 've given up hope . - Set a course for the Esperanto . But I promise you it 's futile , sir . I 'll start preparing the suspended animation booths . Hang on a minute . Where the smeg are we ? The computer woke us early . It must have something . Maybe it 's something to do with this planetoid ? Just scanning , sir ... No , that 's ridiculous . - What is ? - It 's not even worth mentioning , ma 'am . Must be a scanner fault . Rescanning . - What ? Again ? - What is it , man ? You look shakier than a silicon implant ward during an earthquake . Well , according to all our scanners , that planetoid out there is ... Red Dwarf . - Gah ! Must be on the blink . - Of course it is . This is a piece of equipment that detected a planet entirely populated by air hostesses . We spent two weeks checking that out . I knew we gave up to soon ! It was worth at least one more week . - However , there is one additional factor . - Which is ? - That we 've been here before . - It 's the cockpit , dummy ! We come here all the time . Doesn 't this sector of the galaxy look familiar ? Kryten , it 's space . Black with twinkly bits . It all looks familiar . On the port side , sir , is the ocean world where we discovered the Esperanto . That was just before we lost Red Dwarf . - Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? - I 'm thinking leather underpants with silver studs are a mistake if you wear them inside out . - What are you thinking ? - About a mallet , you and ice cubes again . - This planetoid , let 's check it out . - The weather scan says it 's beautiful . Tropical temperatures , not a cloud in sight . Suggest we dress for snow and take the buggy . ( THUNDER CRASHES , WIND HOWLS ) Take some readings and grab some soil samples . - Looks kinda blowy . - It 's an electric storm . There must be more electricity than the surge that went through the National Grid during the commercial break in the Olympic all-girl custard wrestling finals . ( WIND HOWLS WILDLY ) Phew ! I can 't believe you 're here . How did you persuade Kryten to let you out ? He 's not my mum , Kris . I hope the Cat 's not too long , I promised we 'd be back by tea . Joke . It 's impossible out there ! - Do you need some different goggles ? - No , I need a comb ! - Sweet ? - Thanks . - Here , have another one . - I can do it . - Don 't be silly . Let me . - I can do it , really . I 'm not an idiot . ( GAGS AND SPLUTTERS ) ( WIND HOWLS ) Can I ask you a question ? Now that I 've got no arm , does it ... does it make any difference to anything ? I mean , if you were a female pit bull terrier , how would you feel about a three-legged ... ? Does it make any difference to - plucking any old relationship out of the air - us ? Dave , before you lost your arm , I thought you were a no-good , disgusting bum . - And I still do . So no , none at all . - Will this make any difference to women ? Losing an arm isn 't going to make any difference to any woman who cares about you . - Really ? - Really . - What about sex ? - Not here . It 's too sandy . - How did you get on ? - Take a look . This sand didn 't start out as sand atoms . They 've been engineered nanobotically . - From what ? - Computer chips , you name it . According to the particle analyser , this planetoid is Red Dwarf . - Where are you going ? - I 'll need some help ! There 's a lot of stuff out there worth checking out ! What stuff ? Hey , it feels like the storm 's easing off ! Come and see for yourself ! Oh , I was beginning to worry ! Oh ! What on earth is this ? The whole damn planetoid 's packed with stuff from Red Dwarf . Supplies , bunks , drinks dispensers , you name it . - It 's like a giant car boot sale ! - We got some valuable stuff ! What ? Napkin rings ? A box of hairnet requisition forms ? A motorised tie rack and an inflatable shark ? - What a haul ( ! ) - There must be some useful stuff . I couldn 't see what I was getting . All right , dudes ? - What the smeg are you doing here , Hol ? - Those little wotsits . - Nanobots ? - They remolicurised ... They remolic ... They remol ... Anyway , they did that word that I can 't say to the whole ship and left the bits they didn 't wantI What ? They fixed your core program , then decided to leave you ? Yeah , it was shortly after they 'd met me . Well , from one machine to another , welcome back online , Holly ! What 's happened to him ? That 's quite horrific , isn 't it ? Cheap razor ? It 's just not worth buying them from garages , is it ? - Don 't you remember me ? I 'm Kryten . - Kryten ? I 'm sorry , mate . It 's the way the light was shining on your - what 's the word ? - " face " I suppose . I just didn 't recognise you for a minute . Never forget a face , usually . Never . - It 's good to see you again . - And you are ? Unbelievable . Dumped on a planet in the middle of an electro-storm and left to rot for hundreds of years , and the guy 's lost nothing . So , while we were on the Esperanto , your nanobots mutinied and took over Red Dwarf ? They wanted a ship . My body had nothing new , but Red Dwarf itself was far too big . But they 're nanobots . They can change anything into anything else . Yeah , they can turn a Pot Noodle into food . So they took Red Dwarf , made a subatomic version , and turned the rest of the atoms into a planetoid ? What were we chasing ? What was producing that vapour trail ? - Red Dwarf . - Did someone turn over two pages at once ? We were chasing the nano-Red Dwarf . That 's why the readings were so minute . So now they could be anywhere ? You pursued them across half the galaxy . Until we lost track of the readings - a scanner malfunction . Or they went out of reach of your scanners . But we were gaining on them , bud . Scanners scan on the outside . To escape , they just had to stop . You mean , the nanos could be in here , on board Starbug somewhere ? Hey , he could be right . He 's back . Kicking bottom or what ? Recalibrating scanner , sir . Performing internal sweep . - What are you getting ? - Nothing yet . Just two pieces of Bombay aloo you dropped several millennia ago down the ducts , where they appear to evolved a rudimentary intelligence and formed a folk duo . - Damn scanner . - Keep looking . Narrowing parameters . Oh . Oh , my . You were right , sir . I think we 've found them . Where ? They 're there , OK . So Red Dwarf spent the last two years exploring my laundry basket ? The ship is now so small that to the nanos a hole in an athletic support is the size of a galaxy ! Hey , I like the sound of that - Dave Lister , the man with the galaxy-sized jockstrap . Little scampsI It 's the oldest trick in the book . Capture your ship , turn it into a planet , then explore a macro-universe in a laundry basket . How could you fall for an old scam like that ? Ma 'am , tell me if the readings change . ( FAINT BLEEPING ) Same . Still the same . - Still the same ! - They 've changed ! Ha ! Nailed the little blighters ! After all the embarrassment they 've caused me ! Kris , find a frequency to establish contact . Leave it to me , sir . I 'll make contact . Can you hear me , you little critters ? We want our ship back and a new arm for Mr Lister ! Are you receiving me ? - ( BLEEPING ) - Ah , we have contact . They 're communicating in machine code . Leave the talking to me . Have you any idea what you 've done , deserting your droid ? You 've broken every reg in the manual ! And to compound matters by stealing our ship , it 's unbelievably ... Er ... It 's unbelievably ... naughty . Now , listen up . Here 's the deal . We want that planetoid turned back into Red Dwarf and we want you to build a new arm for Mr Lister . - ( HIGH-PITCHED WHINE ) - If you don 't , you 'll get more of this . ( ELECTRONIC SQUEALING ) So they 'll manufacture a new arm from existing tissue ? I 've got them so worked up , they 'll do anything I say . - Where are they ? - Here . On the tip of my finger , sir . Millions and millions of them . Now I just insert them into your body . What with ? - Hypodermic , sir . - Thank God for that . I can 't bear to look . Has it worked ? Someone tell me ! Let 's all turn around after three . ( CAT ) One , two , three ! - Did it work ? - It 's been a 100 per cent success , sir . In fact , it 's been a 500 per cent success ! In fact , they 've ... Well , if that 's all , sir , I think I 'll retire for the evening . Goodnight ! Release me , Kris . I 've gotta see it . They probably didn 't mean any harm . I think they were trying to make up for before . They can have another go , OK ? Aaaaaaaaarrrrrgh ! ( CAT ) HeyI Nice rebuildI Those nano-dudes have done a real neat job . Hey , it seems even bigger than I remember . Er , guys , we 've got a problemi # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

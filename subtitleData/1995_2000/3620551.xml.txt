I say he 's a rat and we throw him overboard like a rat . - Yeah . - Right . Let 's give him the heave-ho . How 's about another dip in the Atlantic ? Dirty Jerry . Yeah . Even the sharks won 't eat him . What you got to say for yourself , Jerry , before we throw you back in ? - My name 's not Jerry . - What 's that ? Eh ? My name 's Mulder . Fox Mulder . - Is that a name ? Mulder ? - I got ID in my pocket . " Fox Mulder , Federal Bureau of Investigations . " - Sorry .

What do you mean ? I say cut him and see what color he bleeds . - Dirty Jerry ! - Deutschland uber alles . Deutschland uber alles ? Wait a second . How 's about you shove a cork in it , mate ? AII right ? Aye ? What 's this about ? We found him in the water , sir . Don 't know nothing about him . I think he 's a German . Bring the prisoner in my room . Friend or foe ? - What ? - To what flag do you pledge allegiance ? I think there 's been a mistake . I think there 's been a mistake . I think the mistake is mine . - Speak the truth . - This is the Queen Anne ? - Aye . - Hey , that 's enough of that . - I came looking for this ship . - Say the word . I 'II make him first . - Wait . I think I can explain what 's going on . - It 's a ruse , Captain . - What 's our current position ? - Cut the spy up . No , I 'II tell you . We 're two degrees above the 30th parallel . Sargasso Sea . Just above the tropic of Cancer . 64o west by southwest , off the PIantagenet Bank . 60 miles south-southwest off Bermuda . How would I know that if I 'd been in the water ? Aye . That 's a damn good question , lad . I 'm waiting for a damn good answer . Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me you haven 't been able to get accurate compass readings . It 's because you 've been caught in something called the Devil 's Triangle . I can show you . It 's because you 've been caught in something called the Devil 's Triangle . I can show you . It goes from Bermuda down to Puerto Rico , back up to florida . The Queen Anne is stuck here on the eastern edge . You 've been caught in some kind of time warp , some kind of limbo dimension , and now you 've popped out the other side into 1998 . - 1998 ? - This man is mad . - Let him tell it to the fishes . - I 'm done fooling ' about . There 's a war on . And in it or no , I don 't plan to lose me mind , nor me ship , to the likes of a jackal like you . You can relax . There 's no war . The world is at peace . There 's a Iittle trouble at our White House , but that 'II blow over , so to speak . Peace ? It 's September 3 , 1939 , man . Hitler has entered Poland . We 've been boarded by his goose-stepping hooligans , so don 't speak to me of peace , lad . Tell Mother England . No , it 's not September 3 . It 's November 16 . Look . - Excuse me , Captain . - Aye . Sir , the Germans have taken control of the bridge . Steering a course for their homeland . Not on the watch of Captain Yip Harburg , they 're not . Lock the prisoner up in here . It 's OK . The war is over . Let ' em take you to Germany . They make nice cars . This is unbelievable . Mayday . This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI . I 'm on the SS Queen Anne . Ship in distress . Mayday . .. British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland , a state of war would exist between us . No such undertaking has been received . Consequently , as of today , September 3 , 1939 , this country is at war with Germany . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? .. closing places of entertainment . AII cinemas , theaters and other places of entertainment are to be closed immediately until further notice . The evacuation of British children is going on smoothly and efficiently . The Ministry of Health says ... What the hell is goin ' on ? Spender ? He , hast du was gefunden ? Bleib doch stehen ! Horst du nicht ? Umdrehen ! Hast du was gefunden ? Warten Sie mal ! Halt ! Stehen bleiben ! Halt ! Hier ist er nicht ! Zuruck ! Excuse me . Scully . Get your Nazi paws off me before you get one in the kisser . No , it 's me : Mulder . You speak English ? Want to see the stars on the American flag ? - I 'm not a Nazi . - Sure . You just look like one , right ? - I had to steal this uniform . Scully ... - Hier ist der Mann , den Sie wollen ! Hande hoch ! Hande hoch ! He said put your hands up . You see ? I told you . You 're all big men now , but wait until you get to Russia . I hope you fellas like the cold . I hope you fellas like the cold . Hold still ! Hast Gluck , dass wir dich nicht sofort abknallen . - Same to you , Adolf . - Schnauze ! Bringen Sie dieses Schiff auf Fahrtrichtung Deutschland oder wir schaffen Sie vom Steuer weg . Verstanden ? I 'II not give up this ship . - Zeig ihm , was ich meine . - Aye , you can put me down , man . But I 'II not let go of this wheel . So till we meet in hell ... Erschiess ihn . You . Wer ist dieser Mann ? Er hat einen meiner Leute zusammengeschlagen und seine Uniform gestohlen . Er ist Spion . Wo sind die Waffen versteckt ? - No sprechen . - Die Waffen haben Sie an Bord , nicht ? I don 't speak Nazi . Erschiess ihn auch . Wait a minute . Why are you shooting me ? Why are you killing me ? What have I done ? I don 't understand what you 're asking me . Halt ! Nicht schiessen ! Dieser Mann ist ein Amerikaner . Oder wollen Sie mehr Leute am Krieg beteiligen ? Bring ihn nach unten . Bring alle nach unten . Skinner ? Where are they taking me ? Help me , Skinner ! What are you guys doing here ? - Mulder 's in trouble . - What do you mean ? - Mulder 's in trouble . - What do you mean ? - Let 's take a walk . - OK . Where are we going ? - The walls have ears . - I have ears . Tell me what 's going on . - Mulder 's disappeared . - From where ? From the National Reconnaissance Office 's Lacrosse mid-Iatitude imaging radar satellite . - What am I looking at ? - A whole lot of nothin ' . We got that 45 minutes ago off the NRO satellite which today sent a picture of a ship which inexplicably appeared in the Atlantic . The SS Queen Anne , which , by all accounts , vanished over 60 years ago . The British luxury liner . - Right . - It was torpedoed by a German U-boat . - That 's one story . - There 's another ? Though her exact position was kept a secret for fear of spies it 's thought she was just south of the PIantagenet Bank when she went missing . Less than 60 feet of water , yet she was never found . - So she just disappeared ? - Into the Bermuda Triangle . And reappeared this morning at 6.49am Eastern Standard Time . Impossible . - The satellite can 't lie . - It 's blank . We gave the original images to Mulder for navigational aids . - He was in a hurry . - To get where ? - Out to the Queen Anne before anyone else . - He 's gone out here ? He went to Bermuda and he chartered a powerboat . - We tracked him on the satellite . - Until the storm obscured transmissions . - That 's what you have . - What happened ? We can 't know without alternative tracking data , which is why we 're here . - Without data we can only hope for the best . - And expect the worst . We have to get help . - With no position he 's a needle in a haystack . - What do you need ? Navy AWACS SLAR or SAR 100k swath imaging . You 're gonna have to find somebody at the Pentagon to get it . Wait for me downstairs . - I need to speak with him . - Could you take a seat ? - Is he in ? - Yes . Sorry . This can 't wait . Sir ? Can you hold on a minute ? What is it , Agent Scully ? I just received some very disturbing information , sir . I need your help . I 'II call you back in five . - You can 't come rushing in here . - I couldn 't waste time explaining myself . - Tell me what is so urgent . - Mulder 's done something incredibly rash . - I can 't . - He may be lost at sea . - I can 't . - You can 't what ? - Help . There 's nothing I can do for you . - It isn 't for me . It 's for Mulder . My hands are tied . I 'm not your direct superior now . - Don 't you wanna know what this is about ? - No , I don 't . I don 't even wanna hear it . - Sir , this is about a man 's life . - I 'm not allowed to have contact with you . Any contact with you or Mulder . She walked right past me , sir . - You 're out of line , Scully . - No , sir , you 're out of line . I 'm sorry , but I 'm coming to you for help and I 've got nowhere else to go . I would hope that after everything you 'd have the courtesy , the decency , and not to mention the respect to listen to what I have to say . Now , all I need is information . You don 't have to do anything else . Sir , if you know anybody at the Office of Naval Intelligence it would be of great help . I could lose my job . My pension . I could even be subject to legal action . Use your head , Scully . It 'II save your ass . Save your own ass , sir . You 'II save your head along with it . Sorry . Yes , sir . I 'II get those files and make that call . Yes , sir . I 'II get those files and make that call . - I need a word with AD Kersh . - Sorry . He 's not available . Assistant Director Kersh , may I have a moment ? - A moment for what ? - May I , sir ? Thank you . Sir , I need you to get me some information . I am not at liberty to say why but I can tell you it is of the utmost importance . - Yes ? - I ... Sorry , I shouldn 't have come unannounced . May I see what you were gonna show me , Agent Scully ? It 's nothing . Really . Good . What am I thinking ? Sorry . Come on . Answer the phone , Mulder . Answer the phone . The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not responding . Damn . I want you to do me a favor . It is not negotiable . Either you do it or I kill you . - Are you OK ? - No , I 'm not . I 'm a gun ready to go off , so don 't test me or think about trying to weasel me . What is it that you need ? Navy AWACS SLAR 100k swath south-southeast of Bermuda . I am looking for a boat , maybe a ship . - 1939 luxury liner . - 1939 ? Don 't ask too many questions . I don 't care what you do . I need that information and I need it now . Are we clear ? Crystal . Agent Spender ? If you 're not back in a hurry I 'II hunt you down and so help me God ... Right . God . - Hello ? - Agent Fowley ? Yes . I was looking for Agent Spender . I 'm sorry . He 's not here right now . Is there something I can help with ? Yeah . Agent Scully just gave the assistant director a piece of paper with an intelligence system scribbled on it . Yes ? - Yes , sir ? - Who is this ? - Agent Scully . - I ... - I was sent to fetch you . - I was waiting for Agent Spender . I was supposed to pick up a delivery from him . Agent Spender is with Assistant Director Kersh . That rat bastard ! Stupid ! Scully ! Mulder , is that you ? No , I can 't . I 'm on an elevator . Hold on . I 'II be off in a s ... Hold on . - Hello ? - Scully ? I can 't understand ! I can 't ... - Was that you ? - Is it you ? I 've been trying to reach you . I got the information you needed . - How ? - Don 't even ask . Sir , what you 've done ... - .. could save Mulder 's ass . I know . - Thanks . And if you ever ask me to break policy I will have you written up and tossed out of the FBI for good . Understood ? Yes , sir . Yes . - Did you get it ? - Yeah . American , right ? Saved your life , mate . Krauts don 't want no reason to bring you into the war . - I got two words for you - Pearl Harbor . - What ? After Poland , Hitler 's off to Denmark , Holland and France , with a few stop-offs . The French all but roll over on us . The Italians seize their opportunity and the Japanese come through the back door . - It 's a Iong bloody story with a happy ending . - We win ? You come out on the side of history with help from us . Not much to apologize over the next 50 years , except for maybe the Spice Girls . Dann mal raus mit euch . Vorwarts . Worauf wartet ihr ? Mach schon . Los . Well , according to our host this 'II be our new accommodations , lads . You speak German . What was that shouting about ? They got it in mind that we left America carrying arms to England . - Are we ? - Listen . She 's drawing 16 feet at 81,000 tons . We 're making 21 knots at full power . If we got munitions aboard this ship they weigh but a few stone . But the captain knew something . He wouldn 't give up the wheel . The Nazis boarded us after they intercepted a radio communication . Some kind of code word they keep asking about . Thor 's Hammer . Do you know what that is , mate ? Who goes there ? I said who goes there ? Show your faces or we 'II bloody beat them to a stump . Put your irons down . It 's your own crew , for God 's sake . - What you doing here ? - Having a cup of tea . - What 's it look like , you stupid swabbo ? - Then who 's steering the boat ? Just some blokes who answer to the name of Heil Hitler . You ever been to Germany ? They 'II have a special affection for the likes of you . - Yeah , right . - This ship can 't go to Germany . - Make up your mind , mate . - I got news for you . You 're not carrying munitions . It 's something more deadly . - Thor 's Hammer . - That isn 't a weapon . It 's a man . A man who helped build a bomb that 'II win the war for whoever has it . - You 're telling me he 's aboard this ship ? - I saw him . In the ballroom . Was ist los ? Sein Name ist Thors Hammer . Er hat einen Plan , eine Bombe zu bauen . Auf Wiedersehen , mates . What 's wrong with you ? Don 't you know there are spies everywhere ? Trust no one , man ! We 've got to stop this ship ! Now ! Hey , you ! Who 's in charge of this engine room ? Hey , I 'm talking to you ! Shut her down , man . We 've got to scuttle her now . - Put some piss in her , boys ! - You heard him ! Kill the engines ! - There 's no other way , swabbo . - You can 't get to Germany if you can 't steer . Me overriding her . We steering ' a course for home . You seen your compass ? You can 't get to England going the wrong way . We 're not going to England . We 're going to Jamaica . You 'II steer her home , you ruffo . To the home where she belongs ! Listen to me ! You can 't take this ship to England . You 'II never make it . There 's only one place she 's going . - Jamaica ! - You can 't take the ship to Jamaica either . The Germans will hunt you down no matter what course you steer . Hear now ! And who you be , boy ? - My name 's Mulder . - He wants to go back to America . No , I don 't . I want you to take the ship , turn it back around the way you came . - bloody hell ! We 're halfway home ! - You 've got to turn this ship around . - And what 's in that direction ? - The future . Actually , the past . - Well , I 'm convinced . - I can explain it to you . Du ! Der Amerikaner ! Du kommst mit uns . Rauf hier . Mitkommen . Turn this ship around ! Or Hitler rises , Germany wins and your children will never know what freedom is ! halt 's Maul jetzt . halt 's Maul jetzt . Klappe ! Weitergehen ! Links rum . Na komm , mach schon . Halt ! Halt ! Stehen bleiben ! Stehen bleiben oder ich schiesse . Aufstehen . Mach schnell ! Get up ! Er sagte ... Wir haben einen Mann an Bord , einen Wissenschaftler , der weiss , wie man eine Bombe macht , die den Krieg gewinnen wird . Frag ihn , wer dieser Mann ist . There 's a scientist on board who can make a bomb . Who is this man ? I don 't know . Waffe bereit ! Sag ihm , wir werden einen Passagier umbringen , fur jede falsche Antwort . You will answer the question or we will begin killing passengers . Which one is the scientist ? I don 't know . Erschiess ihn . Frag ihn , wie viele Personen er sterben lasst . How many lives are you willing to sacrifice ? None . Then you have the answer ? Er weigert sich ihn zu nennen . Schiess noch mal ! Stop ! He has no answers . You 're killing innocent people to Iearn that he knows nothing . - Shut up ! Shut up and move away . - Listen to me , you little weasel ! Wir haben unseren nachsten Passagier , eine Dame . Richte die Waffe auf sie . Erschiess sie , wenn er die Frage nicht beantwortet . Answer the question . I 'II answer the question . Beantworte die Frage . That man is the scientist . Scully , you 're not gonna believe this . Get up here . What ? The sky just cleared and there it was . Is it the Queen Anne ? That 's her . - I don 't believe it . - Seeing is believing . They 've got power . Maybe Mulder 's already on board . Let 's hope he is . - You 're lying . - He 's telling the truth . Shut up ! Who is the scientist ? I told you . This man is the scientist . Untersuchen ! - Frag ihn , wie der Mann heisst . - What is the man 's name ? John Brown . Ask me again and I 'II knock you down . - What 's his name ? - Puddintame . - Ask me again and I 'II tell you the same . - Wait ! Don 't shoot . - I 'm the scientist . - This man 's a liar . I 'm the scientist . please , tell the truth before someone else has to die . - I don 't know him . - Don 't listen to her . She is traveling with me to protect me . She works for the OSS . Fuhrt diesen Mann ab . That 's great . I don 't see you did any better . Erschiess sie zuerst . Erschiess alle . What did he say ? - I think I know what he said . - You learn fast . - What 's happening ? - The engine shut down . - Hey ! - Hey what ? - Come with me . - Why should I ? Cos you 're the only one who can save this ship . Come on . Stehen bleiben ! Stehen bleiben oder ich erschiesse Sie . Hande hoch . Hinter lhren Kopf . - Machen Sie 's ! - Now what , Einstein ? Machen Sie 's ! God bless America . Now get your asses out of here . Byers ? Langly ? Frohike ? Come on . There you guys are . - What are you doing ? - Telling you how to save the ship . I can 't stay . I gotta get back to history . - What ? - You gotta rescue it . Wait , listen to me . The ship 's been caught in something called the Devil 's Triangle . Some kind of time warp . - Are you crazy ? - Einstein predicts the theoretical possibility . He also predicts an atomic weapon to destroy the world . Yeah ? So what ? If you don 't go back and convince the crew to head back into the Devil 's Triangle , everything Einstein predicted will become true , except for the outcome of history . So if I don 't turn this ship around ... In all likelihood , I won 't exist . And neither will you . So in case we never meet again ... I was expecting the Ieft . Mulder ? Mulder , it 's me . - Where am I ? - You 're in a hospital . - Lie still . - I feel like hell . I don 't blame you . You 've been through the wringer , I 'd say . - What happened to me ? - You did something incredibly stupid . - What did I do ? - You went looking for a ship , Mulder . In the Bermuda Triangle . - Say that again ? - Gilligan awakes . - You were there , Scully . - He 's delirious . - And he was there too . - Right , me and my dog , Toto . - No , you were there with the Nazis . - Will you settle down ? It 's an order . - Not that he takes orders . - You saved the world , Scully . - Yeah . You 're right . I did . - What kind of drugs is he on ? - I want some . - No , the Queen Anne . I found it . You were there with Thor 's Hammer . I told you to turn the ship around , then I jumped . Yeah , I bet you did . The boat that you were on was busted into a million pieces . And as for the Queen Anne , it was nothing more than a ghost ship . No , no , no . You and I were on that ship , Scully , in 1939 . Get some rest , Mulder , cos when you get out of here , I 'm gonna kick your butt , by God . I would never have seen you again . But you believed me . In your dreams . Mulder , I want you to close your eyes , and I want you to think to yourself " There 's no place like home . " Hey , Scully . Yes ? I Iove you . Oh , brother .

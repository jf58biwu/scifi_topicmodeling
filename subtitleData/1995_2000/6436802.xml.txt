 You make man ? No- - woman . MONSTER : Woman ? [ THEME MUSIC ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces and bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation- - is it real ? It 's my creation Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand- - It 's alive- - alive ! [ BEEPS ] OK , you know the plan . Piece of cake . I slip into the Farber High computer system and grab the student file on- - what 's her face . Uta Streumgart- - 5 feet , 7 inches of blue-eyed , Bavarian babe-age . A little inside info , and she 'll fall victim to my ( GERMAN ACCENT ) blitzkrieg of love . Ya vol , Herr " Ubagroper . " Let 's get crackin ' . Roger . I 'm goin ' in . COMPUTER : Welcome to the Farber High computer system . LISA : I 'm in . Switching to video . What the hell is this ? Cyber space- - a virtual representation of the Farber High computer system . [ BEEPS ] Wow , it 's pretty advanced for a high school computer . OK . I 'm at the record subdirectory- - all the students ' permanent records at my fingertips . Ooh , what do we have here ? Gary Wallace , discipline record- - tardy , tardy , disruptive , lewd behavior . You have no right to read my personal , confidential file . Put it away and go find Uta 's . [ STATIC ] [ BEEP ] Uta Streumgart , personality profile right here . Turn-ons- - moonlit strolls and kittens . Turnoffs- - pestilence . Bingo . Upload that bad boy and come on home . LISA : Roger-dodger . Wait . Pan left . No , your other left . What was that ? [ STATIC ] Report cards , huh ? We have a change in the mission profile . LISA : No way , stretch . I 'm not here to hack your grades . Come on , Lis ' , just one- - Home-Ec . I would have had an A if it weren 't for the grilled cheese final . It isn 't fair , Gary . Fair ? How am I supposed to know Kraft singles come individually wrapped . That 's why they call them " singles , " brainiac . Just change my grade , please . [ ALARMS SOUNDING ] Lis ' ? What 's happening ? Dammit . It 's a protected file . [ BEEP ] [ ALARMS SOUNDING ] [ PANTING ] I 'm trapped in here . Security program , booby-trapped . Lis ' , Lis ' ! LISA : Fix it . Game over , man . [ STATIC ] Oh , boy . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] How could you lose an entire genie ? Everything was under control . Then bam- - Lisa gets caught in some high-tech cyber booby trap . High-tech ? You got to be kidding . The Farber computer is such a dinosaur , you could debug the sys op UNIX subroutines without even rerouting the backdoor access codes . Don 't you think I tried that ? [ BEEPS ] COMPUTER : Welcome to the Farber High computer system . See ? When you know what you 're doing- - COMPUTER : You are trespassing- - [ BEEPING ] - -in a secured computer matrix . Your location is now being traced . [ BEEPING ] We have locked on to your location . Please wait for the authorities to arrive and take you into custody . Thank you . I can 't log off . Why don 't you just , you- - you know , plug up your backdoor UNIX hole . [ BEEPING , TYPING ] Watch out . Whoa . I wasn 't expecting that . Neither was Lisa . We got problems . Scampi 's got a new computer . Getting Lisa out isn 't going to be easy . Right . We 're going to need steely nerves- - OK . - -and cat-like reflexes- - Yeah . - -and a license to kill . How about a plan ? A plan sounds good . Hello , gentlemen . [ GASPS ] Oh , Principal Scampi . We didn 't hear you walk up . [ CHUCKLES ] [ GONG ] [ ASIAN FOLK MUSIC ] Listen for him . He cannot be heard . Look for him . He cannot be seen . He moves with the cunning stealth of a Shaolin priest . Can I help you boys with something ? Uh , we were just admiring your new computer . Ah , yes . Apparently , some of our less scrupulous students have been hacking into our old system . No . Fortunately , I 've been able to divert some funds from the nurse 's office . So , uh , say goodbye to Bactine and band-aids and hello to El Diablo . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC ] El Diablo ? El Diablo- - protected by the most advanced security system ever devised , virtually impregnable . [ GULPS ] Carry on , men . They did it . Huh ? El Diablo . I 've been reading about it for years . It 's supposed to be completely hack-proof . So what do we do ? We have to access it directly . And that means getting into Scampi 's office . Piece of cake . I 've been sent to Scampi 's office so many times , I got my own coffee mug . [ COUGHS ] Isn 't there an easier way to get sent to the principal 's office ? Every puff is a nail in my coffin . Shut up and smoke . [ DOOR OPENS ] Do I smell the demon tobacco ? [ FUSE BURNING ] - Cherry bomb ! [ EXPLOSION ] Ah , jeez ! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] The false alarm- - a classic prank . It never fails . [ ALARM SOUNDING ] Fire ! Fire ! [ SHOUTING ] Mr. Pecktate is really gonna freak when he gets a load of Elsie here . [ MOOING ] [ LAUGHING ] So let 's recap . Magic genie- - constant trouble . No magic genie- - can 't get arrested . Makes you think . Don 't worry . This plan will work . And since Gary and I are considering careers in education , we were hoping to learn from the best . We want to be your proteges . Really get inside the mind of a principal to learn from you , benefit from your knowledge . Learning more about Scampi , the principal , is to get a glimpse into- - Scampi , the man . What do you say , sir ? You boys have brought a tear to an old educator 's eye . To really know a man , you need to know his passion- - fishing . Peaceful , isn 't it , boys ? Mm . I often come here to escape the day-to-day complexities of being a high school principal . It allows me to think , to reflect , observe . Ah . You should try it . I have to go to the bathroom . Actually , son , we call it " the head " out here at sea . There you go . [ LIQUID SLOSHING ] [ FLIES BUZZING ] [ SCHOOL BELL RINGING ] Hey . All day on that damn boat , and still no password . It 's time to get serious . Tonight , we break into that office and steal the computer . I hope Lisa 's OK in there . Help ! Help ! Let me out of this damn computer . [ BEEPS ] [ JACKHAMMER ] [ ELECTRICITY , BEEPING ] We seem to have picked up a shimmy . [ GROANING ] So you want to play rough , huh ? Bonzai ! [ ELECTRICITY , BEEPING ] That shimmy is getting worse . Try this . [ EXPLOSION ] [ ELECTRICITY , BEEPING ] Well , goodnight , nurse . I 'd say a call to tech support might be in order . [ DIALING TONES ] [ METAL CLANKING ] WYATT DONNELLY : All right , the rope , the rope . Ah ! [ GROANING ] Good thing we brought the rope . We 're in , aren 't we ? [ GROANING ] Let 's grab the computer and get out of here . The computer . Where 's the damn computer ? [ GASPS ] Oh , boy . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] The computer 's gone . And Lisa with it . What do you think happened ? There 's only one way to find out . I knew you boys would get hooked on fishing . Guess they 're just not biting these spinning potsies . I got a few nibbles on my Pinky Tuscadero . So how 's El Diablo these days ? The darn thing crashed on me , so I sent it back to the factory . I think I 'll try a straight Chachi . You sent it back to the factory ? Why 'd you do that ? You can 't do that . Ah , don 't worry . It 's under warranty . A good memory purge , it 'll be as good as new . ( ON TV ) When they knock , we 'll just say , come in , gentlemen . [ SHOUTS ] - Oh , no ! Oh , no ! Come out ! [ LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ] Did not see that coming . Hey , Chett . Beat it , butt whiffer . The Big Ragoo is about to dance . I 'm listenin ' . So let me get this straight . You two pudding ' cups want me to help you break into a high-security computer complex and risk being shot , arrested , and electrocuted just to steal a lousy computer ? Yeah . Sounds doable . Too bad you can 't afford me . [ CHUCKLES ] Did I mention we were going after Principal Scampi 's computer ? [ WESTERN MUSIC ] Scampi ? Scampi , who humiliated me ? Who beat me at every turn ? Never forget . Never forget . CHETT DONNELLY ( VOICEOVER ) : It would have been the crowning prank of my sophomore year . I 'd spent all of fifth period coating the halls with Crisco . Once I yanked the fire alarm , the entire student body would perform the ultimate spastic " Grease " dance . [ GASPS ] Where 's the freakin ' handle ? Looking for something , Chester ? The freaking handle , as you call it , is safe in my possession . And you , my friend , have a date with a certain lemon-scented fellow we call Mr. Clean . Uh , later , tater . [ GASPS ] [ GRUNTING ] Scampi . Scampi ruined everything . I 'm in . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] So that 's the plan . Now , usually , there 'd be a question and answer session . But who 's kiddin ' who ? Only one of us is coming back alive . And you 're looking at him . Let 's move out . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Penetrator to Captain Puke . Are you there ? Come in , Captain Puke . Over . I will not answer to Captain Puke . OK , fine . Then you 're Major Dump . Dibs on Captain Puke . No , I want Captain Puke back . You snooze , you lose , Major Dump . Ow . Hold your position , Major Dump . Hairspray ? Oh , thanks , man . The humidity in here is really screwing with my do . [ SPRAYS ] [ CHIMES ] [ SPRAYING ] Ah , way to go , Chett . We 'd have walked right through that . Damn straight , " Butt-veeta . " Wait . I think we 're gonna need this . Cool . What 's that do , create some kind of laser deflector force field ? Nope . Theme music . Puts me in the mood . [ ROCK MUSIC ] What ? The primary objective . We 're getting close . Couple more minutes , and we 'll have Lisa back . If they haven 't erased her yet . [ PLAYING HARMONICA ] [ DOG SNARLING ] [ BARKS ] Big dog . We 're Alpo . [ WHISTLING ] Cool . Let me try it . [ WHISTLING ] [ BARKING ] [ SNARLING ] [ BARKING ] Nice goin ' . Chett , no ! You promised . No killing ! If you don 't have the juevos to do what it takes , you should have stayed home . Now stand back and let me do my job . Sorry you had to see that , kid . [ LAUGHS ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Pay dirt . How do we get in ? Simple . Sis , I need your ATM card . What 's the code ? 3425 . Thanks , Butt Lick . [ SNICKERING ] SONG LYRICS : Hallelujah . Hallelujah . Mission accomplished . Let 's grab it and get out of here . Wait . It could be a trap . [ BEEPING ] [ CHARGING ] Yeah . This baby 's hot . We can 't just unplug it . Why not ? Security system 's linked to the power grid . If we turn anything on or off in this room , we 'll set off the alarm . So what do we do ? We make toast . Hm ? This toaster uses the same amperage as the computer . If I plug it in at the exact moment that I unplug the computer , they 'll never notice a drop in the power . You can do this ? I can do this . Stand back . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [ GASPS ] No problem-o . Uh-oh . [ ALARMS SOUNDING ] [ SHOUTING ] Go , go , go ! Come on ! Ow , pinkie . Ow ! What do we do ? Go . Save yourselves . We can 't leave you here . I knew the risks when I signed on . You 've got to leave me here . Be strong , little bro . I know it 's tough to leave your own brother behind . But it 's the only way . Now , go . OK . Later . Hey , guys . W- - where are you going ? I didn 't mean it . I was just trying to be brave . Come back here . I 'm your flesh and blood . We can 't really leave him here . It was fun to think about . Hang on , Chett ! One of these wires has got to operate the bars . Which one ? Any one . Just start slapping wires together and get me the hell out of here , you freaking idiot . [ ELECTRICITY ] Oops . Wrong wires . Try touching the blue one and the red one . No , I just did the blue and the red one . I know . I thought it worked well . [ ELECTRICITY ] ( SLURRING ) Hey , Wyatt . Remember the time I smeared margarine all over your face and held you down while the dog licked it off ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . That was funny . ( GROANING ) Let 's go home , Chett . OK . Hey , Gary . Gary . Remember the time I shaved all the hair off your butt ? That was the cat , Chett . That was funny . Any luck Lisa 's still in there ? Yep . A few more minutes , we 'll have her file back . [ BEEPS ] Hey , this is not my room . [ DOOR CLOSES ] This is not my room , either . You better hurry . We may need a little Lisa magic to take care of Reddy Kilowatt here . [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ ECHOING BIRD CALL ] ( CALLING ) Loon , loon . Lake loon . [ CROW CAWING ] [ OBNOXIOUSLY CAWING ] Magpie . [ BIRDS TWEETING ] [ MAKING BIRD CALLS ] Whip-poor-will ? Curly . I 've always been a " Stooges " fan . [ LAUGHING ] Oh- - [ SHUSHING ] The fish . [ THEME MUSIC ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different . We 're making weird science . Oh , pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces and bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation- - is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

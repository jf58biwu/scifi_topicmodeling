Where 's the boy ? Mr. Wallace . Ali looks even better than he did in Ankara , does he not ? Yes . It 's amazing . It 's amazing . The Nefasti pendant . You placed it there you must remove it . All right . This is half the deal . Where 's the ring ? Ali . Go . Dr. Wallace I must tell you I 'm having second thoughts about what we are dealing with . I am not sure what we are doing is right . I 'll be the judge of that . Saving my daughter 's life is right . - Yes , but like this ? I 'm not so sure . - Don 't try to jack me for more money . - I don 't have any more money . - It is not money that concerns me . It is our souls , all our souls ! Dr. Wallace , I have had time to think since our last meeting . I want to give you one last chance to reconsider . I swear . I will send the pendant and ring back to Ankara . I will return all your money right now . You want the best of both worlds , absolution from God and money . I don 't give a damn what happens to your soul . I want the ring . The pendant is useless without the ring . Yes . He who wears the ring is the spring of life . He who wears the pendant drinks of that spring . Why is Ali taking so long ? I 'm going back there . Don 't do this . Do you take responsibility for these actions ? - Yes . Get your hands off and give me the damn ring ! Since the beginning oh time mankind has existed between the world oh light and the world oh darkness . Our secret society has been here horever protecting others hrom the creatures who inhabit the shadows and the night . Known only to the initiated by our true name The Legacy . Hey , Derek , you wanted to see me ? What 's wrong ? A friend of mine a colleague at the university , an anthropologist Clayton Wallace his daughter Samantha is dying of aplastic anemia . She 's barely 24 years old . - I 'm so sorry . - We were very close when Samantha was young . I was an honorary uncle , you know , that sort of thing . She was almost like a daughter to me . His wife died suddenly of pneumonia about five years ago . He tortured himself for the longest time . He felt that if he wasn 't so dedicated to his work he might have done more . I have no idea how he 's taking this . Think about how you 're feeling right now and then multiply it by 1000 . And then there 's the guilt , you know . Survivor 's guilt . That 's always with you . I called the hospital . I 'm going there tonight . - You want me to come ? - Yeah . It would be a big help . So tell me straight , Phil . We 've been through this for the last three months never quite as bad . How long does she have ? It could be just a matter of days , Clayton but she could leave us as soon as tonight . I 'm sorry . Hi . I got you presents from the desert . Dad . You got me a bug ? It 's not a bug . It 's a scarab , symbol of immortality . It 's beautiful . - But I think it 's a little late . - Let 's not have any talk like that . Now , you do me a favor . You 've got to keep this on and get some rest . I love you , Samantha . I 'll do anything to take your place . Derek , I ... I really appreciate your coming . I am at a loss for words as to why I didn 't tell you sooner . - You must understand . - Oh , Clay , I understand completely . Please . I 'm only here to be of help if I can . Samantha 's very special to me . Well , I think she knows that . I certainly know that . No offense , Rachel , but I don 't feel a need for a psychiatrist . No offense is taken , Dr. Wallace , just know the offer stands . Well , I don 't think it 'll be necessary . I 'm not the one to be worried about . Well , Clay , please , consider your situation . You 're all alone , Samantha is very ill . Dying . Why don 't you just say dying ? That 's what everyone around here thinks . - She 's gonna pull through ! - And that is what we 're all hoping for , really . Thank you . Thank you . I wish there was something I could do for him . There 's nothing more devastating than the loss of a child . Oh , Derek , she 's so young . Way too young to die . So was his wife . It 's almost more than one can bear . But you know that , Rachel . It 's one of the unsettling comforts of the work we do knowing death is just a doorway to somewhere else . You will drink from my spring . My God . No mistake . There 's not a single sign of the anemia returning . Let 's say you 're one lucky young lady . And that wouldn 't even be the half of it . My father , he was so upset last night . He should be here now . Oh , he will be . He will be . And there 's no sign of secondary damage ? - Nothing . - You mean , I 'm actually cured ? - How can that be ? - I 'd like to take credit for it , but I can 't . We 're gonna run a couple tests over the next 48 hours just to be sure . And then , believe it or not you 're out of here . Great . But to where ? I gave up my apartment . You can stay with us , Sam . - Are you sure ? - I insist . Hello , Dominick . Can you help with the luggage outside ? It 's been three days , still no sign of your friend . I 'm sorry , I 've done the hospital , missing persons , the works . I just can 't find him . Sam . Nick Boyle , Samantha Wallace . Nick works with us here at the Luna Foundation . - I 've heard a lot about you . - Hi . So , what does it feel like to be on the business end of a miracle ? Well , I 'm still pretty shaky . Maybe that 's because my father 's still missing . And I don 't know if I 'd call it a miracle exactly . I mean , you 'd think a miracle would feel more miraculous , I guess . Come on , I 'll show you to your room . - Derek ? - Yeah ? - You are still looking for my father ? - Don 't worry , Sam . We 'll find him . I promise you . Just before Samantha awakened in the hospital I definitely felt something . - A presence ? - Not so well-defined but undeniably a dark force . Considering her recovery and Clay 's sudden disappearance there 's no way I can let this pass . Start at the university , find out what Clay 's been up to in the last year or so since Samantha got sick . I can look into her medical records . And , Nick , keep a close eye on Sam . She 's comfortable around you , maybe she can tell us ... Derek ? It 's happening again . No ! I have no more life to give . No . No ! God help her ! I don 't understand how her symptoms could disappear so completely and then , less than a week later , come raging back . I 'm at a complete loss . I couldn 't explain the remission I can 't explain the relapse . - Any word from Clay ? - Nothing . We phoned him at his home again all night . At his office . He 's disappeared off the face of the earth . Excuse me , I have to go to her . I have your numbers , I 'll call if there are changes . - I 'll stay with her . - All right . Come on . Who 's there ? You son of a bitch . It 's not working . She 's dying again . - Let me go . I can help you . - You said this ring would work . I wanted to die in her place . The scarab is still hungry . Your life force is not strong enough to save her . Her illness is too great . - Why did it let me live ? - So you could pass it on to feed on someone else , someone stronger . - Someone younger . - Age is but one factor . But beware . With each attempt to revive her she will need more and more water from the spring to slake the scarab 's thirst . Each attempt ? There was to be one sacrifice . Me . - It will not relinquish its hold . - Then how can I pass it on ? It appears , Dr. Wallace as with all things in order to regain your life as it was you must pay the price . Do it . Nick . Hey . It 's happening all over again , isn 't it ? It hurts , Nick . Close your eyes . Come on . Now breathe deeply and try to relax . And imagine that you are in your favorite place in the whole world . And let the pain flow out of your body like clouds floating past the sun . You 're beyond it now . It can 't touch you . There . Open your eyes . That was the slightly abbreviated version . You know , I 'm actually all right with this . - With being sick ? - No . No , I hate being sick . But over the past few months I 'm at peace with dying . You know , you embrace life hold it close but when the time comes you gotta let go . You know what my favorite place is ? - Where I went when you said that ? - Where 's that ? A houseboat I lived on with my father when I was a little girl . Thanks for taking me there , Nick . I feel a lot better . Nice thing about living on a houseboat you don 't gotta mow the lawn . What 's up with the hand ? - Nothing . I cut it . - Is that right ? Well , I got a rep for being a cut man myself . Give it up . And I mean everything . - I don 't have any money . - Don 't . Don 't . Don 't mess with me . Do not mess with me . Come on . Hold on ! - What 's this ? What 's this ? - No . Don 't do that ! Don 't what ? Don 't what ? - You giving me orders now ? - No , no . - How much is this worth ? - It 's worth a lot . It 's worth everything I own . It looks good . Damn good . Sam ? Samantha ? - Are you okay ? - Oh , yes , Nick . I am . In fact , I 've never felt better in my entire life . I stood right here the day he and Teresa brought Samantha back home from the hospital the first time . He stopped keeping it up , but he couldn 't bring himself to sell it . Not even after Teresa died . Here . Yes , I thought so . Well , you 're right . Somebody has definitely been staying here . They got some Chinese . Look at this . Three days ago . That about says it all , doesn 't it ? Well , so does this . Sorry . Corrigan . Really ? Yeah , we 're on our way . What ? Barzman says Samantha has recovered . He 's running tests , but he thinks she 's well again . - That 's impossible . - In the true meaning of the word . And Clay is there . He showed up right after she got better . This is a switch . You 're a vegetarian . I know . But Dr. Barzman says I need as much protein and iron as I can get . It 's either this or needles . And I 've had enough needles to last me a lifetime . Hey , Derek , Rachel . - Well . - Hello . - Look , I 'm better . - I heard . I see . It 's amazing . - You 're telling me . - Hi , Nick . Hey . - Clay . - Hi . - Can I talk to you for a moment ? - Yeah . Well , you 're not messing around in the grub department , huh ? Hey , I could go for a real cocktail now . What happened to you , Clay ? Where have you been ? These last few days have been a ... A haze . When Barzman told me that Sam only had another day to live I completely lost it . I wandered the streets , stayed in the houseboat . What happened to your hand ? I cut it . I broke a window on the houseboat . God only knows where the keys are . - Why didn 't you stay at your house ? - My house . I had to sell my house . I needed the money . When Teresa got sick , I didn 't react fast enough . If I had , she 'd be alive . Clay , your wife had pneumonia . - You did ... - Whatever I did wasn 't enough . This time I 've sold everything I own to buy Sam the best possible treatment . - And it worked . - It seems to have worked . Two complete recoveries from the brink of death in less than a week . You 're a scientist . How is it possible ? Think about it . I don 't want to think about it . I 'm tired of thinking . I want to accept this for what it is . - What is it ? - All I know is I got enough strength to come back here , expecting the worst only to find that my little girl is okay . Now , that 's enough for me . Quite enough . All right , but there 's one thing I won 't let you get away with . - What is that ? - Once Sam 's released I want the two of you to stay with us at the Luna Foundation . Until both of you get your feet back under you . And I won 't take no for an answer . Well , the answer is yes . Thank you . I went over Samantha 's medical records . What it comes down to , pure and simple is that she should have died twice , but she didn 't . Alex ? Well , Clay was on a research dig in Turkey when Samantha first displayed serious symptoms about a year ago . He flew home immediately and the diagnosis of irreversible aplastic anemia took two months . That 's when she was confined to the hospital . Right , but get this . While she was in the hospital Clay took a leave of absence from the university flew back to Istanbul on his own dime and stayed two weeks . Why was he in Turkey in the first place ? Well , the initial dig was authorized to uncover relics on the Hittite Empire . Nothing special there . But there 's something up with that second trip . I 'm still working on it . Clay told me he sold everything he owned including his house , to get treatment for Samantha . So get dates of those sales and crosscheck them against his itinerary . - Anything else ? - Yeah . The police found a body near their houseboat with something very twisted about the condition of the corpse . - Any details ? - It 's kind of sketchy at this point but I have a friend in the coroner 's office who said she 'd help us out . Okay . You know , I think I was born to live in a castle preferably with lots of servants . Well we can 't stay here forever . Did you really spend all your money ? Yes . And then some . Well , that wasn 't too bright . Not too bright at all . What will we live on ? We 'll get by . I 'll go back to the university . You 'll go back to school , work on ... - Oh , Daddy , please . ... your teaching degree . Now that I almost died , I ... I wanna live a little . Forget school . I wanna have fun . You 've always had such a passion for teaching . Well , you know what they say about those who can 't . Present company excluded , I hope ? Of course . But now I wanna do things . I wanna go out . You know my friend in there , Nick ? He 's a pretty great guy . I wouldn 't mind spending some time with him . - What do you think ? - Well , I haven 't thought about it . Now Daddy 's embarrassed by his little girl . Don 't worry . I won 't forget you . If it weren 't for you , I wouldn 't be here . I wouldn 't be here at all . You 'll always be the number one man in my life . - Let 's dance . - No . - Yeah . - Samantha , I think ... Oh , don 't think , dance . What ? What ? What ? What is it ? I don 't ... I don 't feel so good . - It 's not the same , is it ? - No , it can 't be . I 've been fed . Daddy , you gotta help me . Yes , I 'll do anything . What can I do ? I think you know . Could be a mutated virus . Maybe a variant of that flesh-eating bacteria that 's been cropping up . Whatever it is , we 're not taking any chances . - You got time of death on this guy ? - His watch stopped at 11 : 23 . - And he 's missing a finger , huh ? - No , not missing . Severed . They found it at the scene . Sliced off at the nub . Nice . - It 's hot . - Thank you . What a pretty ring . Samantha keeps losing life . I don 't know what to do . You 've been through a lot this week . Do you have children ? Yeah , a little girl , Kat . She 's 8 . I 'll bet you 'd die for her . In a heartbeat . If someone threatened that child , I 'll bet you 'd kill that person . You know , this is one of those questions I 've thought about . It 's ... Yeah . If I came around a corner and someone was messing with Kat I think I 'm capable of it . If she needed a heart , you would take the heart of the most heinous serial killer , wouldn 't you ? - What are you asking me ? - Lf she was dying and you had the power to save her by taking the life of a useless member of society no one knows , no one cares what would you do ? I think the more important question is what would you do ? Is there something you wanna tell me ? I would like to continue this conversation at another time . I have to check on my daughter . How are we doing ? Not so well . Daddy , please don 't let me die . - You 're not dying . This is not a relapse . You 're just weak . I need someone . Now . Samantha , how many more will it take ? It hurts , Daddy . God ! Please , Daddy . It hurts so much . Please , Daddy . So Samantha 's asleep . Clay 's gone out to clear his mind . And the autopsy report 's in on that corpse . The cellular structure was completely blown away . There 's no sign of disease but all cellular life was completely ionized and drawn out leaving only crystalline salts . - Drawn out by what ? - They don 't know . And the severed finger 's a mystery as well . Till they figure it out , they 're keeping it under wraps . I can understand that . Also , there 's no time of death on this guy but his watch stopped at 11 : 23 . Now , if whatever killed him fried his watch , that was the time of death . I talked to Dr. Barzman , and he said that 11 : 23 was the exact time that Samantha started to recover . - What more do you have on Clay ? - I still don 't know the reason for his return to Turkey but I did manage to track him from Istanbul to Ankara where he spent most of the time . How about his finances ? When he got back , he closed his pension fund sold off his stocks and bonds everything except for the title on the houseboat . Well , I guess we can assume he found something or someone in Ankara . - A faith healer ? - No . No , I ... Not a faith healer , nothing that benign . What he 's involved in is much darker . All right . Get out of there ! You don 't touch that ! Daddy will be home soon . He hasn 't forgotten his wife and little girl . Only he 's gone on a long business trip . But he 'll be back , so don 't worry . Don 't cry . There , there . Don 't cry . Don 't cry . Who 's there ? It 's you . Daddy 's home . I was just telling her that you 'd be back . You see , he loves us . I 've brought you a gift . A gift from the desert . It 's beautiful . Daddy brought Mommy a beautiful present . A pretty , pretty thing . A pretty thing . What 's wrong ? Mama . God ... God , forgive me . Samantha ? - You okay ? - I 'm more than okay . Nick , how did you get here so quickly at 5 : 00 in the morning ? I just couldn 't sleep . I was walking downstairs . Walking downstairs or waiting for me to get up so you could ? I feel so good . Don 't be shy . I 'm not going to bite . Unless it 's called for . - You know what I wanna do ? - I can imagine . I wanna go out . Yeah . Let 's go get something to eat . I 'm starving . Out ? Now ? You know , we got plenty of food here . Oh , no . No , I wanna go out . I have a great idea . Let 's ... Let 's go to one of those all-night places and get a big bunch of food and we 'll take it to my father 's houseboat . You know , I don 't think that 's such a good idea , considering how late it is . No . No , Nick , please . Take me to the houseboat . It 's my favorite place . Remember , I told you in the hospital ? I was happy there . I just wanna be happy again . I don 't know how much longer I have left . Please ? All right . Get your stuff . So , what do you figure , we got enough stuff ? Don 't worry . I 'll make the best breakfast you 've ever had . - Oh , yeah ? I 'm gonna hold you to it . - Yeah . Watch your step . - Daddy . Oh , my God . - Come on , let 's get him inside . Come on . The Nefasti scarab necklace . The exact one Samantha has . It was stolen from the Ankara museum two days before Clay left the country . Probably smuggled it out later , no doubt . Along with its deadly mate the Lapis Lazuli scarab ring . Now , according to the legend of Murtasis the Conqueror who died at the ripe old age of 432 after he murdered half of his subjects : " He who wears the ring is the spring of life . He who wears the necklace drinks from the spring . " The ring and the necklace were in the museum ? Yes , but the idea of Clay demanding a test before paying in full is right on the money . The day after the break-in a really strange-Iooking corpse was found on the riverbank . By the time the police got there , it disappeared . Derek . Nick 's gone . So is Samantha , and I found this in her room . The houseboat . And Clay never came home at all . I 've got to go there . I can 't do this anymore . I can 't . Even though I love you , I can 't do it . - Do what ? - Nothing . He ... - He doesn 't know what he 's saying . - I 'm in complete control of my faculties . I know exactly what you want me to do to him . Nick , he 's delirious . Oh , jeez . I 'll handle this . - Could you give us a minute ? - Yeah , sure . What have I done ? What have I done ? You 're pathetic . Have you got the ring ? Yes , God help me . You 're far beyond the help of any God . I suppose I am . Then work out the logic , Dad . You 're good at that . It doesn 't matter what you do anymore , so give me the ring ! Now . Daddy , please ? Give it to me . You know I need it . Please , Daddy . Nick I don 't feel so good . You okay ? Nick ! No ! Get away from her ! Yes . Make her stop , Clay . - She 's my daughter . - That thing isn 't your daughter . Samantha 's dead . Only you can remove that pendant , Clay . For God 's sake . Let her go . Oh , my God ! - Samantha ... - No ! Don 't touch it ! Baby , remember how happy we were before your mother died , here on the houseboat ? So happy . No , Dad , please . - You 'll kill me . - I wanted you to live forever but not like this . Do it now , Clay ! Sam I 'm so sorry for the pain I caused you . So sorry . Dad . I don 't feel any pain anymore . The pain is like a cloud moving across the sun . I 'm finally at peace in my favorite place in the whole world .

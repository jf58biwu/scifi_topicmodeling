Plus that bozo who went bang . Well , take your stuff and get out of here . Sir , he broke out of jail . You want to explain that to a board of inquiry ? Yeah . Funny thing is , I still can 't believe he 's dead . I mean , I know he came down in pieces , but ... a guy like that , he really believed he was what he thought he was , you know , and you sort of have to admire that . He got you . Cynical me . I thought he was just a cheap con . My keys . He stole my keys . Funny , your car was here an hour ago . Somebody must 've took it . Yep ! ( Sighs ) GARY : I think this is for you . ( orchestral version of " White Christmas " playing ) CHUCK : It 's magic . At least it is if you believe . Which , I guess , can happen to the best of us . Merry Christmas . Yeah , same to you . It all depends on being wise enough to know your heart ... and young enough to feel that old surprise . I 'm Dreaming of A white Christmas With every ( cat yowls ) Christmas card I write ... May your days Be merry And bright ... ( music slows ) And may All your Christmases Be White . Merry Christmas . SANTA ( in distance ) : Merry Christmas !

 Ten months ago , the crew of Voyager was pulled into the Delta Quadrant by an entity known as the Caretaker . Not enough time ! When he died , Voyager 's best chance of getting home died with him , but he revealed one hopeful possibility . There is another like me . She left hundreds of years ago , but she 's out there , somewhere . Open yourself to the impressions around you ... the thoughts ... the minds that are on this ship . What do you hear ? Voices . So many voices . I believe you are sensing the thoughts of various crew members on board . What should I do ? See if you can isolate one of the voices . Imagine you are listening to a symphony and focusing on a single instrument . It 's working . Try to maintain your emotional equanimity . You should not be concerned with success or failure . Uh-oh . He 's taking off too much . I told him just a few millimeters off the top . Way too much now . Don 't touch the sideburns . It 's Neelix ! I can hear Neelix 's thoughts . That is not unexpected . You have an emotional attachment to him which may have drawn your focus . My scalp itches . Maybe I should tell him about that shampoo of his . I think he 's getting a haircut . Oh , no ! He 's trimming the ear hairs . I told him the ear hairs are the perfect length . Not the ear hairs ! If you are to succeed in honing your telepathic abilities , you must learn to control these emotional outbursts . Outburst ? It was a giggle . Tomorrow , I will teach you a Vulcan mind-control technique that will help you inhibit your giggles . Thanks , Tuvok . You may go . You 're late . Sorry . My lesson with Lieutenant Tuvok went a little long today . Today , yesterday and the day before . You 'd think a Vulcan would be more attuned to punctuality . I 'll try to keep a closer eye on the time from now on . So , how was school today ? Wonderful . Tuvok helped me with a sensory focus exercise , we worked on my precognitive skills , and I learned how to self-induce a hypergogic mental state . Sounds stimulating . He says I 'm making excellent progress . I had no doubt that you would , but I 'd appreciate it if you wouldn 't let these ... mind studies interfere with your ... What 's that ? I don 't know . Life-signs ? Apparently so . But before I could analyze them , the life-signs simply ceased . I 'm scanning the remains on all biospectral frequencies . It 's completely inert . Dead . Somehow , I find it hard to believe this rock suddenly came to life for several seconds . I concur . However , dead or alive , these are the remains of an alien entity we never fully understood . It may be prudent to place it in a level-3 biohazard containment field . Agreed ... but first , I want to take a look at ... I 'm picking up life-signs . They 're sporocystian . The Caretaker was a sporocystian life-form . But , according to my readings , the life signs aren 't coming from the remains . The remains are simply resonating in response to an external energy source ... some other life-form . Where ? Let 's find out . Janeway to Bridge . Mr. Kim , begin scans for a sporocystian life-form . Aye , Captain . Stand by . I 've got it , Captain . A sporocystian energy burst approximately ten light-years distant . But I can 't get a precise fix on its location . The life-signs are gone . These remains could be responding to the Caretaker 's mate . If that 's true , maybe we could use them to track her down . And if we can find her , she might have the ability to send us home . Torres to Janeway . Go ahead . We 've placed the remains in a hexiprismatic field , Captain . The next time it responds to sporocystian energy , the field should give us a heading to the source . You 're using the remains like a compass . Exactly . Good work . Keep us apprised . Janeway out . Captain , the Caretaker was a being of considerable power , and although his intent was not hostile , we were essentially at his mercy . I do not care to repeat that experience . And if we are about to meet his mate , you 'd like it to be on more even ground . Precisely . I have studied the Doctor 's biochemical analysis of the Caretaker remains , and I believe it is possible to create a sporocystian toxin ... something which might debilitate the life-form . Sounds like a sensible precaution . Get on it . I 'm picking up sporocystian energy . Chakotay to Engineering . We 're picking up life-signs . Is your compass working ? Stand by . Activate the field . I can 't get a bearing on the source . Try increasing the spatial resolution . Spatial resolution at maximum . The life-signs are fading , and I still can 't get a lock on the coordinates . Boosting the signal gain . We 've got it , Captain . Bearing 272 mark 19 . Acknowledged . Mr. Paris , set a course and engage at maximum warp . Aye , Captain . Captain , we 're picking up an artificial structure on long-range sensors . It appears to be a space station of some kind . Slow to impulse and put it on screen . That looks a lot like the Caretaker 's Array . The configuration is similar . So is the surface composition , but it 's only about one-tenth the size . Are there any sporocystian life-forms on board ? No , but I am picking up over 2,000 carbon-based life-forms . They appear to be ... Wait a second . Confirming . Captain ... they 're Ocampa . We 're approaching the station , Captain . All stop . Hail them , Mr. Tuvok . No response . I am reading an energy surge from the station ... possibly weapons . Shields . Definitely weapons . Shields are holding . Incoming message from the Array . Let 's hear it . You 're not wanted here . We pose no threat to you . I 'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the ... You have been warned ! They are Ocampa ? That 's right . There appears to be an entire colony . And , according to our sensors , the station is at least 300 years old . Kes , is there any Ocampa history about people who left your planet or were captured by aliens and taken away ? No . The idea that there could be Ocampa anywhere but on the homeworld is something no one ever considered . I thought I was the only one . Since you 're definitely the only one on Voyager , I want you to act as an intermediary . Gladly . What should I do ? The first step is to arrange a meeting . Let 's see if we can get that far . Hail the Array . This is becoming tiresome , Captain . If you force us to take further aggressive action ... I have someone here who wishes to speak with you . My name is Kes . I 'm an Ocampa . This is some kind of trick . I assure you it 's not a trick . What would an Ocampa be doing on an alien starship ? It 's a long story . But I 'd like to know what an Ocampa is doing on an alien space station . That is also a long story . Then I suggest we meet and tell each other our stories . May we come aboard your station ? No , but I am willing to come to your ship . Our readings identified a sporocystian life-form in this area . We 've been looking for that life-form for months . Why ? To destroy it ? No . On the contrary , we believe it has the technology that could send us home . Captain , are you aware of how your ship is regarded ? That when Voyager appears , people fear destruction ? Your ship is known as a ship of death . What ? You 've established quite a reputation . You killed the Caretaker , declared war on the Kazon , raided planets for their resources . None of that is true . We 've never attacked anyone except in self-defense . And we did not kill the Caretaker . He died of natural causes . Mr. Tanis , please try to understand , we only want to find the entity we 've been looking for . I want to talk to you alone . Our sensors tell us she 's somewhere in this region . Can you help us find her ? Captain , I 'd like to speak to Tanis alone , if I may . Very well . Why should I believe any of this ? These are kind people , Tanis . They saved my life , at great risk to themselves , when they didn 't have to . They wouldn 't lie to you . I will admit , these people are hardly what I expected . But more unexpected was finding you here , Kes . I had no idea any Ocampa had left the homeworld so recently . I have about a thousand questions to ask you . I know , and I 'm going to try to answer them . Is this where you spend your time ? You mean in this room ? No . This is where the Bridge officers usually meet . I want to see where you live . I want to see the place that is special to you . You did all this ? I had a little help , but , yes , most of it is my work . Well , you 've done well ... bringing something so beautiful into a place so sterile . Sterile . Voyager ? Look around you , Kes . This is a cold and barren place . There are over 150 people on board . I 'd hardly call that barren . There are people , but there 's so little life . Part of me weeps to see you in this place . You 're so isolated . Corridors , bulkheads ... all cutting you off from the world around you . You live on a space station . How is it any different ? I assure you , it 's very different . You 're very young , aren 't you ? Two years . Would it surprise you to know that I 'm 14 years old ? That 's not possible . The oldest Ocampa only lived to be nine . You know so little about your own people . There 's so much for you to learn about yourself ... about the galaxy . Being here on this ship is holding you back . These people are helping me . I 'm a member of the crew . I suppose we were like you once ... innocent , naive . But when Suspiria brought us here 300 years ago , she began to teach us how we could become stronger than we ever could 've on the homeworld . Suspiria ... is that your Caretaker ? We don 't think of her as a Caretaker . Her species is actually called the Nacene . Then you do know her . Where is she ? Nearby . But she 's so different from the entity you knew . He was only interested in maintaining the status quo . He kept our people servile and weak . Suspiria taught us to develop our psychokinetic skills that had lain dormant for so long . We have abilities far beyond anything you can imagine . Like what ? We can enhance life . And that 's only the beginning , Kes . I have to return to the station . We 'll talk again . Sounds like you 've established a dialogue with Tanis . It 's an excellent beginning . Good work . Thank you , Captain . Kes ... is there something wrong ? Not exactly . I 'm just a little overwhelmed . I always believed that my people had the potential to be more than what they were ... that our mental abilities could be somehow heightened ... and now I 've met someone who 's realized that potential and I don 't know whether to be excited or frightened . A nonemotional response would be more useful . But since you 're not a Vulcan , I 'd say a mixture of the two emotions would be appropriate . It 's an exciting moment , Kes , and I 'm very happy for you . But just remember , we know very little about these Ocampa . Be cautious in your dealings with Tanis . I will . But I just have a good feeling about him . I 've met with the Ocampa girl . She has potential . I don 't care about the girl . She 's yours . Bring me the ship . This is delicious ! Mr. Tanis , is it true you 're 14 years old ? Yes . That 's quite common with my people here . Suspiria helped us develop a technology to extend the Ocampa life span three generations ago . My father lived to be 20 years . Would that technology work for Kes ? Possibly . Where does Suspiria live ? On another Array ? Oh , nothing so corporeal as that . She exists as pure sporocystian energy . She only assumes physical form when we need to communicate with her . Does she occupy our space-time continuum ? I don 't know . All I know is , when we need her , she comes . I 'll take you to the meeting place . I 'm sure all your questions will be answered then . You 'll enjoy meeting her , Kes , as well as the other Ocampa here . I 'd love to visit the station . Visit ? Why not stay with us ? Stay ? Yes . I think you could learn a lot from us , we from you . We haven 't been in contact with the Ocampa homeworld for hundreds of years . We 'd be fascinated to hear about our distant cousins . That sounds wonderful , but , uh ... Kes , you certainly don 't have to decide something this important right now . Give it some thought . She 's absolutely right . There 's no rush . I appreciate that . I am curious about your mental abilities . They 're so much greater than mine . Do not underestimate your own potential , Kes . Your mental abilities are rapidly maturing . I might be able to help you . No offense to Mr. Tuvok , but I am more familiar with the Ocampa mind . I would appreciate any insight you could give me . Oh , good . Maybe later this evening . It is a highly reactive sporocystian toxin . I ran a micro-cellular analysis of the Caretaker 's remains , and discovered a critical enzyme in his cellular structure . The energy in this cylinder is formulated to break down that enzyme . It would result in temporary paralysis . Mr. Tanis says she 's harmless . It is my hope that we only have to use it as a precautionary measure . Very well . Proceed . In your mind , visualize your hand . Now reach out with that hand and grab the teacup . Reach out with the fingers of your mind . Grasp it . Do you have it ? I can feel the handle and the texture of the metal , but I can 't move it . Don 't try to move it . Just take a drink from it . See ? You can do it . I don 't understand . I didn 't try to move it . No . You just tried to drink from it . And what would you do if you wanted to take a drink ? I 'd reach out and pick it up . That 's right . But you wouldn 't be thinking about picking it up . You 'd simply do it . And that 's what you just learned . Focus on the goal , not the task . When you wanted the tea , it came to you . Uh , excuse me ... We 're not finished . I know you 're tired , but I want you to try one more thing . It 's cold . Wouldn 't it taste better if it were hot ? See past the liquid . Not with your eyes , with your mind . What your eyes show you is only the surface of reality . Look deeper . There is no liquid . There is no cup . There 's only a collection of molecules and atoms , moving , vibrating ... I see them . They 're barely moving . That 's because they 're cold . How would you heat them up ? With ... a fire . That 's right ... with the fire of your mind . How do I do that ? Focus on the goal , not the task . Don 't think about creating the fire , just use it . I see it now . It 's so simple . That 's right . But that 's enough for tonight . Tomorrow , I 'll take you to the next level . Until then , good night . May I say something now ? Of course , Neelix . I 'm so proud of you . I knew you could do it . This is a whole new beginning for you , Kes . I know , I know . What if I did go ? Go ? To the Ocampa Array . If I decided to live with Tanis and the others ... would you go with me ? I 'd go anywhere with you . Captain 's Log , supplemental . We 've arrived at what Tanis calls " the meeting place " ... the region of space where Suspiria exists . Nothing on sensors , Captain . Captain , may I access your communications equipment ? Of course . I 've sent out a subspace carrier wave . Suspiria should respond within the next 47 hours . I 'll be in my quarters . We 'll let you know when she makes her appearance . That won 't be necessary . I 'll know when she 's here . Tanis has shown me the next level . The psychokinetic manipulation of matter . That is a large step for someone whose mental abilities are still undisciplined . Nevertheless , I am intrigued . May I ? Please . He showed me how to use the fire in my mind . Fascinating . However , I would advise caution in exploring this ability until you have mastered the ... I have to stop the fire . How do I stop the fire ? ! Tuvok ... Tuvok , can you tell me what to do ? ! Tuvok ! No ! Lieutenant , can you hear me ? What happened ? Your cell membranes went through hyperthermal induction . The temperature of your blood rose by 37 degrees in a matter of seconds . You were in shock , and I resuscitated you . I 'm restricting you to light duty for the next three days . Try and get some rest . That will not be necessary , Doctor . My Vulcan healing techniques do not require an extended period of convalescence . Vulcans make the worst patients . Fine , but if you 're feeling any nausea or dizziness , I 'm expecting you to report to Sick Bay at once . Of course . Tuvok , I 'm sor ... You are probably feeling the emotion known as remorse , possibly guilt . I advise you to look on this incident as a learning experience . It 's not that easy . I almost killed you . That is correct , but you did not . Try to remember that . I will see you tomorrow at 1500 hours , assuming you wish to continue your training . You still want to teach me ? If this experience proves anything , it is that you need further instruction , and I would regret not continuing as your instructor . Thanks , Tuvok . How 's the Vulcan ? Is he going to recover ? You heard ? In a manner of speaking . I was aware of what happened . He 's going to be all right , no thanks to me . Tanis , I 've been thinking ... I don 't know if I 'm ready for this . What 's wrong ? If I can 't control my abilities , there might be another accident . I 'm afraid it isn 't going to get any easier , Kes . You 're already starting to manifest abilities far beyond anything you 've ever imagined . Soon you 'll be so far beyond the other beings on this ship that you 'll look at them as they look at ... pets . They 're not pets . They 're people . They 're my friends . And I 'm sure you care for them very much . I 'm sure they 're wonderful people , and they certainly seem that way to me , but ... it 's time that you began to accept how different you are from them . The people on this ship ... they live their lives trapped inside their primitive skulls , depending on flesh and bone to tell them what the universe is like . They don 't know what it is to see beyond the physical . Touch it . This is how they know their universe . They touch the flower , their nerve impulses travel up their arm to the brain , and in their mind , they sense the moisture of the petals , the texture of the leaves , the sharpness of the thorns , and they think they know what it feels like , but they don 't . Now touch it . Reach out with your thoughts . Feel it for the very first time . Think of nothing but the flower . It 's the only object in the universe . Know it . Know it in a way only an Ocampa can . Can you see it ? Yes . It 's more than seeing . It 's more than touching . I know this flower . You can do more . Reach out . Feel all the life in this room . Yes , I can feel it . I know them all . They 're so beautiful . It can be more beautiful . Bring the fire . How did it feel ? They 're dead . They 're all dead . Amazing . You felt life . You embraced its essence with your mind and then you transformed it . There 's nothing else like it in the universe . I killed those plants ... just like I almost killed Tuvok . But I don 't want to hurt anybody . Of course you don 't . That 's not the point . Hurt people , help them , give life , kill ... it 's all the same . Once you see beyond the physical , you see the universe as it truly is . Now you know why you can 't stay with these people ... why you have to come with me . Come back to the station . We 'll care for you . We 'll train you . Oh , I don 't know . I still need some more time to think about it . Take all the time you want . But when you meet Suspiria , I think you 'll decide to join us . Why ? Because Suspiria is your future . She 's part of us , and we 're a part of her . All the Ocampa here are connected in a way that can 't be put into words , and if you develop your abilities far enough , Suspiria will invite you to go with her to Exosia . Exosia ? A place the humanoids on this ship call " a subspace layer , " a place of pure thought , pure energy , a place of the mind . Think about it , Kes . When you 're ready , Suspiria will embrace you . Good night . Torres to Bridge . The Caretaker 's remains are resonating again . It 's definitely reacting to a sporocystian life-form , and from what I can tell , that life-form is right on top of us . Acknowledged . Captain ... there 's a subspace rupture forming directly ahead . Yellow Alert . Janeway to Tanis . Will you please come to the Bridge ? I believe we 've made contact with Suspiria . I know . I 'm on my way . I think we should run a biospectral analysis . Some of these readings are pretty strange . And get me the sensor logs on that subspace rupture out there . Captain , I 'm picking up some strange readings in Engineering . Some kind of plasmatic energy field is forming . Janeway to Torres . We 're picking up some odd plasmatic readings down there . Can you confirm ? Janeway to Torres . Security , meet me in Main Engineering . Aye , sir . It 's time to go . Go ... where ? Back to the Ocampa station . Everyone 's waiting for you , Kes . The connection has been made . You 're part of us now . Your future has already begun . Tuvok to Bridge . Go ahead . I believe the female Caretaker is here . Commander , you have the Bridge . Can 't you feel the connection ? Your people are calling to you . Listen to them . Yes . I can hear them . All of them . And can you hear Suspiria ? Tuvok ? Who are you ? Suspiria . I 've been looking forward to meeting you . Why ? Because I had the opportunity to talk to your companion before he died . Yes , I know . I can feel her presence . She 's powerful ... turbulent . She 's upset . She 's angry ! Kes ... She wants to destroy the ship ! Kes , listen to me . There 's nothing to worry about . Am I interrupting ? He told us that you were curious and went off to explore the galaxy . We 're explorers , too , but your friend brought us to this Quadrant against our will , and we haven 't been able to find a way back . Is that why you killed him ? We didn 't kill him . You destroyed the Array and you took his remains . - I assure you ... - No ! You killed him . And now , I will kill you . Now you will know what frail , small creatures you truly are . What 's going on ? I don 't know . It 's like the entire molecular structure of the ship is coming apart . Red Alert . Bridge to Janeway . Bridge to Janeway . We 're losing hull integrity . Increase power to structural reinforcement . Aye , sir . Forget these people . You 're beyond them . No . Leave her alone , Tanis . Remember how you felt in the airponics bay ? You 've never felt that way in your entire life , have you ? Get away from me . That was only the beginning , Kes . I said leave her alone ! Neelix ! Leave him ! Leave him , Kes ! He 's nothing compared to you . Nothing ! You have to trust . Oh , Neelix . Suspiria ... So , now you kill me as you did my mate . No . I told you we didn 't kill him . Please try to understand . We don 't want to hurt you . We don 't want to hurt anyone . We just want to get home . Tuvok , release the force field . Captain ... Do it . You 'd show me mercy after what I did to you ? Yes , I would . Take me with you ... please . It appears she has descended into subspace . Can you track her position ? Negative . The rupture has been sealed . She is gone , Captain . Captain 's Log , supplemental . We 've resumed our course back to the Alpha Quadrant , but the female Caretaker is still out there with the power to send us home . And I will use all my power to find her and convince her to do just that . I looked at the tea and I tried to make it boil , but nothing happened . Without Tanis ' help , I just can 't do it . Nevertheless , your psychokinetic abilities are still part of you . They might resurface one day . To be honest , I never want to see that part of myself again . To which part are you referring ? To the part of me that got pleasure from destroying those plants in the airponics bay . To the part of me that was tempted to go with Tanis . I never realized I had such dark impulses . Without the darkness , how would we recognize the light ? Do not fear your negative thoughts . They are part of you . They are a part of every living being . Even Vulcans . You ? The Vulcan heart was forged out of barbarism and violence . We learned to control it . But it is still part of us . To pretend it does not exist is to create an opportunity for it to escape . Let us begin . Open yourself to the impressions around you ... the thoughts , the minds that are on this ship .

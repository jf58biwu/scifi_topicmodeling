 [ Hissing ] [ Coughing ] [ Groaning ] [ Breathing deeply ] No . It 's not ... it 's not holding . No . Ah ! That 's better . All better now . [ Whooshing ] [ Rembrandt and Maggie grunting ] ( Quinn ) Oh , look out ! [ Maggie panting ] All right . We got a reading on Rickman ? Yeah . He 's still here . Oh ! Must be over 90 degrees , and it 's dark . We 're probably in the San Fernando Valley . Yeah , we should have fixed that timer to drop us next to a pool in weather like this . [ Sighing ] [ Panting ] Help me ! They 're dead ! They 're dead ! Help me ! Please help me ! No . [ Woman sobbing ] It 's Rickman . But this woman 's dead , not comatose . He went out there , right just now ! [ Whooshing ] We just missed him . When does our window open ? Six minutes and change . Good . Then he won 't have much of a head start when we land there . [ Woman sobbing ] Something 's wrong here . He 's never killed before , and never more than one at a time . The DNA mismatches must be taking their toll . Like a junkie shooting bad dope , the high doesn 't last . The guy needs brain fluid to stay alive . He 's not gonna be too choosy . Excuse me ! People are dead here . Doesn 't that mean anything ? Look , it happened , it 's real . You 're acting like it doesn 't even matter . All that 's important is her revenge ? Yeah . I want him to pay for killing my husband . What about your friend , you forgetting about that ? You can shed a tear for a couple of friends , but in the meantime , he 'll be stackin ' up dead bodies like a cord of wood until we stop him . [ Footsteps receding ] What are you gonna do when we catch him ? Hold her coat for her while she murders him ? He 's got our world 's coordinates in his timer . We get that , we get home , sweetheart . [ Sighing ] The price is too damn high . Rickman has to be stopped . We all know that . Yeah , I just wish Maggie wasn 't looking forward to it like she is . [ Whooshing ] [ All grunting ] [ Whooshing ] We 've been here before . We 've gone backwards through the inner dimension . Is Rickman here ? Yup . The New World . We 're transporting Rickman 's people to save ' em from the pulsars . Well , it makes sense . The man needs victims with the same DNA as his . He hand-picked this whole colony . It 's one big smorgasbord . We 're not far from the settlement . I recognize those peaks . Whoa ! Look at that . [ Roaring ] ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice-over ) Sliders . [ Birds chirping ] ( Rembrandt ) Oh , I can 't wait to see Malcolm , he 's probably grown at least an inch . I know he 'll be glad to see us . Promised him you 'd be back . I bet he 'll be expecting us . We just saw dinosaurs , and you 're rattling on as if nothing happened . Been there , done that , and we got the T-shirt . You shoulda been with us the first time we ran into dinos . It 's not a lot you don 't see if you slide long enough . So who 's this Malcolm ? A kid who owes his life to Remmy . He got him on Rickman 's list to slide into the New World . Well , by the looks of this place , he didn 't do the kid any favors . Well , the good news is we 've only seen plant-eaters . The worst they can do is trample you . Someone wasn 't quick enough . Imagine the force involved to do that . How would you stop one of those things ? [ Chuckling ] Is there anything she doesn 't think of killing ? What ? If you 're spoiling for a fight , sweetheart , she 's gonna give you one , if that 's what you want . What I want is for things to be back the way they were before . Yeah . Me , too . But you gotta play the hand that you 've been dealt , that 's all we can do . It 's not Maggie 's fault the Professor 's gone . I know that . Let 's just give it a rest , okay ? You know , you can be one pain in the butt sometimes . You takin ' her side ? No sides , we 're all in this together . Just that you and Maggie at each other all the time , it could be hurtful to all of us . Yeah . I hear ya , okay ? Tell her that . Yeah , whatever . What the devil happened here ? Used to be home for over 100 people . Look at this . There was only one of ' em . One was more than enough . Now , on our world plant-eaters are not aggressive . But here , that could be different . Hey , Q-Ball , take a look at this . Malcolm had to draw it . Doesn 't look anything like the one we passed by back there . Look at the teeth on that sucker . Yeah , that 's a T. Rex . Natural born killer . These are all unmarked like the ones back there . These settlers would leave crosses , markers , or something . These graves are only a couple of months old . It 's like a plague ran through this place . So why no settlers among the dead ? [ Gun firing ] [ Gun firing ] Good shot . Forgotten me already ? Col. Rickman ? L ... I didn 't recognize you . Your face . You 're different . Oh , very different , I 'm afraid . [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] [ Roaring ] [ Roaring ] [ Screaming ] These tracks are only a couple of hours old . Two sets . Yeah , three , includin ' the dino . He must be hunting ' em . Didn 't do him any good . Maybe that 's why there aren 't any settler graves there . [ Robert groaning ] The dinos eat ' em whole . You hear that ? ( Robert ) Help ! [ Birds chirping ] Help ! [ Robert groaning ] Help ! [ Robert groaning ] Hang on , sick buddy . I 'll have you right out of there . He almost got me . The dinos are gone . No , Col. Rickman . He 's here . He 's gone crazy . He attacked me . ( Quinn ) Just take it easy , we 're safe now . Nobody 's safe . Capt. Beckett ... [ grunting ] ... you gotta stop the Colonel . [ Robert groaning ] That 's why I 'm here . Now , what happened ? Where is everybody ? Scattered , just trying to survive the dino . It hunts us . My ... my camp , it 's ... it 's up there . I 'm going after Rickman . No , not alone . Here , you guys find the camp . I 'll stay with Maggie . Here , take this . We 'll double back and see you in the morning . We have plenty of time before we slide . And if you don 't make it back ? You know the drill . Think about yourselves . I will see you in the morning . [ People chattering ] Need some help here ! Robert ! ( Robert ) I 'm all right , Gretchen . I think his ribs are broken . Lie him down here . [ Groaning ] I know you . The Sliders . Where are the others ? Rickman killed the Professor . Quinn went after him with Capt. Beckett . But you left this world . It 's a long story . We need to wrap his chest and bandage these cuts . Do you have any medical supplies ? Michael . Malcolm ! Malcolm . Remmy ! You came back ! [ Rembrandt laughing ] I promised you that I would . Let me look at you . When we saw that settlement had been torn up , I thought ... Bet you thought the T. Rex got me , huh ? Not me , man . I 'm too fast . I should 've known no overgrown lizard could catch my man Malcolm . [ Sighing ] I can 't tell you how many times Malcolm 's talked about him , dreamed about him coming back . Same goes for Remmy . It killed him to leave him behind . Have you been lookin ' after him ? [ Robert breathing hard ] My own son , Tracy , wasn 't chosen for the slide to this world . I tried to stay behind , but they forced me through the hole . Col. Rickman said we 're needed here . [ Children chattering ] I 'm sorry . I 'm Wade . Gretchen Chambliss . You feel that ? Vibrations . It 's getting stronger . Let 's head for those cliffs . [ Maggie screaming ] Hustle . Hustle . Run ! [ Growling ] [ Growling ] ( Quinn ) We 'll be safe up here . [ Panting ] [ T. Rex roaring ] [ Chuckling ] I guess those little front legs aren 't made for climbing . That 's what I call a terrific genetic flaw . That terminator just might get to Rickman before we do . That make you happy , Maggie ? Only if I 'm not there in time to watch . Don 't give me that choirboy look . You want him just as badly as I do . You were after him with a gun in your hand the last time we were here . I was out of control . Now all I want is the timer . It 's our only chance of getting home . And there 's more nobility in that than in revenge . I 'm not judging you . The hell you 're not . [ T. Rex roaring ] We both know what we have to do . I just wonder if we have the stomach for it when the time comes . [ Crickets chirping ] You like it , Remmy ? [ Chuckling ] Delicious flavor . I don 't think I 've ever tasted chicken this good . Hmm . It 's not chicken . More like gopher or weasel . I trap ' em . I 'm so happy I 'm a vegetarian . The small burrowing animals and birds are all that 's left . The T. Rex has wiped out everything else . Look , uh , we saw hundreds of graves . Those deaths are on our heads , I 'm afraid . The native population had no immunities to the bacteria that we brought with us . Common flu virus went through ' em like wildfire . And they were too superstitious to let us inoculate them . We saw bones at the settlement . ( Gretchen ) We lost nearly 12 people when the T. Rex attacked . We were warned , but no one took the tales seriously . What tales ? ( Malcolm ) The natives worshiped the dinos . They made animal sacrifices to them to keep them happy . When the game ran short , they came to us , asked for some of our livestock for the Allosaurus and the T. Rex . ( Gretchen ) And our stock was too valuable to give in to superstition . So we refused . I mean , we 'd never seen the T. Rexes . We thought they were just a myth until they got hungry enough and attacked . [ Sighing ] No more catered lunch means they have to hunt . How many are there ? ( Gretchen ) Most of them have died from starvation . We 've gotten really good at hiding , and our camps are scattered all over the mountains . But there 's at least one , the biggest and most aggressive . He 's stayed alive by cannibalizing the remains of the others . [ Dog barking ] ( Malcolm ) Want some coffee , Remmy ? Gretchen makes it out of tree bark and fungus and stuff . Tastes like the real stuff . No , no . I think I 'll pass . I don 't want it to , uh , keep me awake . [ Owl hooting ] [ Chuckling ] [ Sucking ] Oh . [ Chuckling ] Remember doin ' that when you were a kid ? Never with worms . [ T. Rex roaring ] You better have a couple , you need your protein . Billions of fish can 't be wrong . Ugh . Come on , it tastes like chicken . [ Chuckling ] You 're really enjoying this . What I 'd really enjoy is a fire . I 'm freezing . Well , we don 't wanna attract any dinos that might be able to climb . Yeah . Or put out a welcome mat for Rickman . You going to sleep ? No , just trying to stay warm . Here , snuggle up . We 'll share our body heat . What is that , Sliderese for " what 's your sign ? " Fine . Freeze . Okay . [ Sighing ] [ Owl hooting ] [ Dog barking ] [ Zippering ] [ Thudding ] ( Quinn ) Hello . Anybody home ? Move and we 'll cut you to pieces . All right . Easy does it , boys . We mean you no harm . I know you . You were Rickman 's right hand . That 's right , but not anymore . Things have changed since we left the old world . We 're hunting the Colonel . He 's here and you 're all in danger . ( Andrews ) The Colonel is a good man . Once he left , we fell apart . Why are you after him ? Uh . The Colonel 's gone totally over the edge . He suffered some kind of brain damage in the Gulf War and now he needs live brain tissue in order to stay alive . He hand-picked all the settlers for the New World because their DNA matched his . My God . Nobody is safe until we find him . You 're too late . He killed our sentry last night . Had a puncture wound right back here . We 're gonna need weapons , and some help . Listen , you didn 't learn to fish and trap on that military base , did you ? No , Bantu showed me . We 'd have starved by now if it wasn 't for him . If it wasn 't for you , the way I see it . Was Bantu one of the native kids ? I taught him to draw , he taught me this . Grab that end . [ Man screaming ] [ T. Rex roaring ] What the devil is that ? ( man ) Somebody help me ! T. Rex . He 's close . ( man ) T. Rex is loose ! [ Roaring ] [ Roaring ] [ Screaming ] [ Crunching ] Did you know him ? He wasn 't from our camp . It was stupid to be down in the flats alone . Malcolm . Malcolm , hold up . Listen , don 't you think that 's a little cold ? That 's the way it is . On this world you can 't afford mistakes . [ T. Rex roaring ] We 're close . I can feel his eyes on us . He knows we 're following him ? You can bet on it . We should split up so we can flank him . Careful , Quinn . You 're starting to think like me . No , I want him alive . Well , that 's your choice . But I 'm not playing by your rules . You never have . All right , I 'll stay on his track . You two flank me . [ Soldier groaning ] [ Cracking ] Freeze ! Over here . Capt. Beckett 's down . How did you know it was him ? I tripped over Andrews ' body back there . Rickman held the morph long enough to sucker you . ( Rickman ) So close , Maggie . Another inch to the right and you 'd have won our little game . Well , at least you kept Mallory in the contest . Let 's end this right now , Rickman . ( Rickman ) Soon , my friends . You should wait here . Your friends are probably on their way back . They should have been here by now . How will you find ' em ? It 's wild country out there . Quinn and Maggie are tracking ' the Colonel . We can track them . She knows what she 's doing . You don 't , but I do . I 'll guide you . Malcolm , I can 't let you do that . Listen , you don 't have a chance of finding ' em without me . I can take care of myself . All right , partner . We 'll bring him back . ( Malcolm ) This way . I promise . ( Maggie ) There 's a cave up here . I 'll go in alone . The hell you will . It could be a trap . Have we got another choice ? [ Bird squawking ] [ Crow cawing ] [ Grunting ] [ Rumbling ] As traps go , it 's a good one . [ Crow cawing ] There . Quinn ? Rickman . [ Electronic pulsating hum ] [ Whooshing ] Damn ! He just vortexed out . We 've gotta go up there . Just be prepared for what you might see . [ Thudding ] [ Panting ] [ Thudding ] You hear that ? Somebody 's tryin to dig us out . Hey ! Hey , we 're in here ! [ T. Rex roaring ] Oh ! ( Maggie ) Get back . [ Quinn grunting ] [ Roaring ] Yeah , he 's after something . Q-Ball 's tracks lead right down there . [ Roaring ] It 's a feeding cave . Bantu showed it to me once . It 's where they left animals for the T. Rexes . Great . Quinn and Maggie are trapped in the dino drive-up window . I think they still might be alive . We 're gonna have to get old Rex away from there if we wanna get ' em out . If we make enough noise , he 'll chase us . There 's this escape pass back down the trail . They dug it to get away after they made the feedings . How far ? Once he starts after us , we won 't have much time . Just stay with me , I 'll lead you to it . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Look , you go back there and wait at the entrance . We 'll meet you there . I don 't want you getting hurt . Now , you do like I tell you . All right ? All right . Now , go ahead . [ T. Rex roaring ] [ Thudding ] You ready ? Can 't wait . Let 's go . [ T. Rex snarling ] There 's no way out . The tunnel dead ends . I 'd love to empty my gun in him , but it would just tick him off . You know , I 'm one up on you for saving your life back there . Now would be a good time for you to even the score . Believe you me , I 'd love to pay you back . ( Rembrandt ) Q-Ball ! Hey , it 's me . It 's Wade and Remmy . Wade ! Wade ? Remmy ? [ Both yelling ] ( both ) Hey ! ( Wade ) You 're ugly ! [ Both yelling ] ( Wade ) Chicken ! Hey , your mama ! [ Both continue shouting ] ( Wade ) Chicken ! Now . Come on ! Go , go , go , go ! [ T. Rex roaring ] ( Wade ) Run , hurry . Run ! Come on ! Come on , he 's almost on you ! [ Rembrandt screaming ] [ T. Rex roaring ] [ All screaming ] ( Rembrandt ) Jeez , that smells ! ( Wade ) Remmy , do something . Ooh , I thought dog breath was bad . Man , I 'm glad you guys made it . Yeah , well , once Rex loses interest and goes back to the cave we 'll hook up with Quinn and Maggie . All right ? Follow me . ( Rembrandt ) Let 's go . ( Maggie ) It just makes no sense to me . Why would Rickman vortex out when he needs the DNA from the settlers to stay alive ? Yeah , especially when you guys were as good as dead . You weren 't a threat to him . He plays by the same rules we do . He ran out of time and he had to slide , or else he would have been stuck here for 29 years . Aren 't enough people left here to keep him goin ' that long . But he can come back to this world , just like we did . He said he was gonna harvest . He 's just waiting for that window to open again . We got 22 hours left before we slide . If he comes back , we 'll deal with him . In the meantime , there 's a T. Rex out there that is a clear and present danger to these people . Can 't kill him . Not with the weapons we 've got . We 've wasted thousands of rounds of ammunition . What about explosives ? ( Gretchen ) There 's nothin ' left . We used all the dynamite we brought with us on the slide to clear land to plant . Maybe there 's something in the settlement we can salvage that 'll get the job done . I can 't imagine what . Yeah , but he can . [ Children chattering ] Come on . We might be able to rig this to make a trap , like the snares that Malcolm makes . So we trap him . Then what ? Problem solved . We weld his mouth shut . Maggie can hold him still . One 's empty , this one 's almost full . You hit it with a rifle , it goes off like a bomb . But we 'll have to get him really close in order to do some damage . Up close and personal . With that cocky attitude , you know he 's got a plan . [ Clanking ] Yep , and it 's killer . What 'd I tell you about that guy , huh ? [ Grunting ] Hey , where did you get there , partner ? A couple of gophers and weasels . We won 't have to hunt for T. Rex . Saw him less than a mile down the canyon . Once he gets a whiff of these babies , look out ! Good job . We 're almost set here . All right . Wade , Maggie , I want you guys to get started . Malcolm , I want you to head back to the camp . But I wanna help . Look , you 've already done your part , trapping ' us bait to bring old T. Rex up here . Gretchen needs you at the camp . You just don 't want me to get hurt . Yeah , yeah , that too . Go ahead . All right ? You sure this is gonna work ? ( Quinn ) Absolutely . You guys deliver the T. Rex , we will deliver the package . All right . Raise it up a couple inches . Right here . [ Grunting ] [ Clanking ] [ Birds chirping ] He 's a great kid . I wouldn 't be surprised if Remmy decides to stay here with him . He wants to get home , just like Quinn and I do . Well , home is where someone loves you . Has he got someone more important to him on your world ? His life , that 's all . Yeah , well , news flash for you . This is your life . The only thing that 's left back on your world is your past . Come on , Rex ! ( both ) Hey , come on ! Over here ! He 's got the scent . Let 's go ! [ T. Rex roaring ] We meet again , Malcolm . You killed my father . And I 'll kill her . And you . Unless you do exactly what I tell you . Where are the Sliders ? ( Maggie ) He 's coming ! All right , once I shoot the bottle , you guys start firing . [ Clattering ] [ T. Rex snarling ] Now ! [ Clanking ] [ T. Rex snarling ] Don 't take this the wrong way , Mallory , but your plan sucks . And I 'm still one up on you . You 've gotta save my life to even the score . I 'd hate to go out owing you one . Well , then , let 's do something about it . You get the bottle close to him and I 'll take it from there . [ T. Rex roaring ] He 's gonna break through any second . The opening 's going to collapse ! Let 's feed Rex before we 're on the menu . All right , we only get one chance at this . On three . ( Rembrandt ) Do not wait for us . You guys start firing once you get an open shot . Fire lots of ' em . 1 , 2 ... Roar , sucker . Open up ! 3 ! Now ! [ Guns firing ] [ Thudding ] [ Both cheering ] Well , that makes us even . Nice shooting . Same here . I think they 're bonding . Hey , we did it , Malcolm . T. Rex is toast ! [ Rembrandt panting ] What is it , what happened ? Gretchen . Bit by a snake . We gotta help her . All right , all right , calm down . It 's gonna be all right . Show us the way . This way . ( Rembrandt ) This is pretty remote country . What was she doing way out here ? ( Malcolm ) She was hunting . Yeah , she was hunting birds . It 's quite a hike from camp . We saw plenty of birds flyin ' there . She likes it out here . She likes being ' here by herself . You 're lucky you found her . I thought you were headed towards camp . You think I 'm lyin ' ? She got bit by a snake . We gotta help . Look , Malcolm . There 's something wrong here , partner . Now , you can tell me the truth . What 's goin ' on ? It 's just like I told it . [ Birds chirping ] It 's okay , I know you wouldn 't lie to me . Col. Rickman . He was there when I got back . He 's got Gretchen , he said he 'd kill her . I 'm sorry . It 's okay , Malcolm , you did what you had to do . We all understand that . She 'll be fine . Believe it , all right ? Where is he now , Malcolm ? About half a mile up there . It 's a box canyon . There 's no way out . I 'll split off . I 'll work my way around and fall in behind him . No . He trained you , he 'd be expecting that . So what 're we supposed to do ? Just walk in there like lambs to the slaughter ? Malcolm , you told him that we were goin ' in the cave to kill the dino , but you didn 't know that we got out alive until you met us on the trail . So the Colonel can 't be sure that we didn 't all die back there . Yeah , and I 'd say the odds were definitely in T. Rex 's favor . It 's a miracle we got out alive . Let 's hope he believes in miracles . Malcolm , you 're gonna have to do a very scary thing . You 're gonna have to go up there alone and tell Rickman that the dino got us . No ! He 'll kill Gretchen . He 'll know I 'm lying . He could be watchin ' us right now . If he were , we 'd all be dead right now . It 's the only way , Malcolm . It 's the only chance that she has . Now you can do it . I know you can . And if he believes me , he might just kill us both right there . No , he 'll wanna see for himself . He 'll take you and Gretchen with him back to the cave . Malcolm , you 're gonna have to go up there , look him in the eye , tell him that we 're all dead . Can you do that ? I 've got to , but I 'm scared . I feel like a coward . Listen . Courage doesn 't mean that you 're not afraid . It just means that you act even though you are , man . That 's bravery , that 's what heroes are made of . And you know I 'm proud of you , right ? Hmm ? All right . All right . Let 's go , then . Where are the Sliders ? Dead . They never got out of the cave . The Rex got ' em . You wouldn 't lie to me , would you , boy ? You see , if you lie to me , I 'll have to cut her . They 're dead , they 're all dead ! Let her alone ! Let her alone ! Man , I 'll kill you ! [ Thudding ] You 're a brave little boy . I could use a man like you . Now , let 's just go have a look in that cave , shall we ? Hey . Hey , boy . Here . Don 't sulk , have some water . Go on , you must want some . [ Rickman grunting ] What 're you doing ? Sloppy , Maggie . Very sloppy ! When you covered your tracks , you brushed out all the other tracks here as well , even the boy 's ! Or ... or did he fly here , eh ? And just touched down over there where the tracks begin ? ( Maggie ) I won 't miss at this range ! ( Quinn ) Neither will I. Well , that makes three of us . You see , if I 'm hit , even with a clean head shot , my trigger finger will jerk , and I 'm afraid this ... this poor boy here , this poor boy here will have an exit wound in his body that you could pitch a cat through . Let the boy go . Hey ! I 'm in charge here . Now , I want you all out in the open now ! Throw your rifle down , Mallory ! [ Gun firing ] I won 't ask again ! Now , Maggie won 't give up her gun because she 's too good a soldier . But right now she 's figuring acceptable casualties . You got a clear shot , Maggie ? Whenever you 're ready . The boy will die , Mallory . Maybe . But if I don 't take you down , he 'll probably die anyway . It 's just a matter of time . So I 'm gonna call him an acceptable casualty . There is another way . Give me the timer and I 'll go . And then you can live here happily in peace , and I 'll know you won 't be chasing me . Now , that sounds like a pretty good plan to me . Don 't do it , Quinn . Your time 's up . I 'm tired of this game . Give me the bloody timer , or I 'll kill this boy ! [ Electronic pulsating hum ] ( Maggie ) Quinn , no ! All right . Easy now . [ Rickman yelling ] [ Rickman grunting ] [ Screaming ] [ Gun firing ] [ Whooshing ] No ! [ Panting ] [ People chattering ] ( Rembrandt ) Excuse me . Hey . I haven 't seen Malcolm this morning . He left early this morning to go check his trap lines . I think he 's afraid to say goodbye to you again . [ Sighing ] Yeah , I know the feeling . Thanks . [ Bird chirping ] [ Water splashing ] Hey , partner , catch anything ? I never miss . When are you leaving ? Soon . Remmy , I can 't go with you . And you can 't stay here . How do you know that 's what I was thinking ? Because I 've been thinkin about it . I wish there was a way we could stay together , but I can 't see it . Yeah . Yeah , you 're too important to Gretchen . She needs you , all of these people do . And your friends need you . [ Sighing ] I 'm not gonna ask you to promise you 'll come back . I 'll just hope for it . Me , too . [ Rustling ] So you won 't forget me . I will never forget you , son . Not in a million years .

 Previously on " The Pretender " - They 're stirring the genetic stew , Sydney . Deciphering the human genome . And not just anyone 's . Mine . Oh , my ... God in heaven . It 's you ! Dad ! For years i would lie awake at night ... wondering what you would be like ... what you would look like . I 've missed you so much . I need to know the truth . Did my mother ever mention a project " Gemini " ? Never heard of it . What do you want , Sydney ? I want Gemini . Gemini has always been mine . His inception was flawless . ... the entire project Gemini has been run ... completely aboveboard . Raines was playing God . And he unleashed the devil . That boy is me . They cloned me ! [ Man narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I 've broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Jarod ] No . No . No . No . Please . No . Please . No . What did they do to you ? I can 't open the hatch ! I can 't open the hatch ! It 's too hot ! I - I can 't think ! I 'm burning ! [ Young Jarod ] I can save him ! - No ! - This is your last chance . I did tell the truth . I 'm at peace . I feel tired . My legs hurt . I set myself on fire because I 'm convinced it 'll send a message , Sydney . [ Young Sydney ] It 's been three days , Jarod , with temperatures over a hundred degrees . - All you have to do is submit . - It 's not for me . - I 'll never give up . - [ Jarod ] It 's not your fault . [ Sighs ] - But - - We 're together now . That 's all that matters . That ... and saving the boy . [ Computer Twitters ] [ Major Charles ] I 'm into the Centre 's mainframe . Damn ! They 're onto me . But I 'm into Gemini . They 're transferring the boy to the Triumvirate . - When are they going to transfer him ? - I don 't know . Damn it ! They 've shut me out . There 's gotta be some other way we can find out . Someone who can tell us . [ Beeps ] [ Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Line Ringing ] - Come on , Sydney . Answer the phone . - Are you going to answer it , or shall I ? - [ Ringing Continues ] - It 's not important . - [ Beeps ] What we have to say is . The timetable on the transfer of our young Pretender has been moved up . He goes at dawn . My work won 't be completed . It can 't be avoided . The mainframe 's been compromised ... and we suspect Jarod and Major Charles . My father says you can continue your work with the boy once he 's been transferred . We expect your full cooperation . You have that . [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] " I vehemently disagree ... " with Dr. Raines 's conclusions about Gemini ... " and despite some humane advances being made at Pakor ... " I cannot in good conscience endorse moving forward with the project . " While it represents a potentially major breakthrough for mankind ... " one must wonder if mankind is or ever will be prepared for its ramifications . Catherine Parker . " [ Door Opens ] [ Exhales Sharply ] You got anything to drink ? Preferably something that burns . Need to cleanse your palate ? No . My soul . I backtracked the cloning records from Donoterase . Over the years , they fertilized 289 ova before they were successful with the boy . The results of which we saw at the specimen lab . Well - [ Clears Throat ] Some of them . [ Coughs ] And if you can believe it ... that sideshow wasn 't the weirdest part of the circus . They couldn 'tjust grow those ova in an incubator . - They needed donor wombs . - Surrogate mothers . Seems Raines found the women himself . Mostly disenfranchised , homeless , loners or coma victims . Women who wouldn 't be missed if there were complications . And-And believe me , there were plenty of them . Most fetuses never reached term . And-And ... the ones that did - Well , they didn 't even make it through - - Childbirth . - [ Scoffs ] Well , if you - if you could call it that . All of the surrogates who made it that far , though , they - they just - - Disappeared . - Without a trace . That 's what my mother was talking - talking about in this Gemini memo . What she feared could happen at Donoterase . What should I do ? Well , whatever it is , you better decide pretty quickly , because they 're moving the boy at dawn . Where ? Triumvirate station , Africa . Your mom 's first priority was the children . What would she do ? The same thing she was trying to do when ... she was killed : Rescue the children . I 'm over here . I 'm sorry . I didn 't hear you come in . Do you want me to do something for you ? No . I just came to talk . Talk ? You don 't want anything ? Just to see you . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . I 'm fine . Ready to work . - You were crying . - No , I wasn 't . I - I just - Don 't tell Mr. Raines . He gets angry if I show any emotion . It won 't happen again . I promise . It 's okay to cry . No , it 's not . Not for me . I 'm here to serve - to do what I 'm told . Is that what Raines taught you ? Yes . That I have been gifted with the intelligence designed to help others . Mr. Raines says emotions get in the way . If you don 't want me to work , then why are you here ? When I was your age , I knew a boy just like you . Exactly like you . I felt for him ... but I never let him know . I saw ... pain ... in his eyes ... but I looked the other way . I see the same pain in your eyes . But I can 't look away anymore . I don 't understand . Do you want to be here , or do you want to do what other kids do ? What do other kids do ? Play . Have fun . Experience life . - Is this a simulation ? - No . No . This is real . I 'm doing what I want to do : Sims to help others . Then why were you crying ? I - I wasn 't . I just - It 's okay . It 's okay . If Mr. Raines finds out , he 'll get angry . And when he gets angry , he - He - - He - - I won 't let him hurt you anymore . I promise . Now we gotta get you out of here . He 's not going anywhere with you . [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] I can 't believe this , Sydney . You 're going with them . - Yes . - Sydney , why ? - You too , Broots ? - You certainly fooled me for the last three years ... bumbling around the globe like a benevolent Dr. Spock ... when you 're really a , uh , psycho Dr. Mengele . You don 't know what you 're saying . [ Phone Rings ] It 's your original lab rat . - What are you gonna tell him ? - [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Beeps ] - Sydney . They 're going to move the boy . I need to know when . I can 't help you anymore . Sydney , I need your help . Please . [ Wheels Squeaking ] And another excursion into the mainframe would be useless . There is no refuge for you anymore . [ Beeps ] He hung up . [ Beeps ] He 's helping them . What did he say ? He said that another excursion into the mainframe would be useless . Why would he tell us where not to look ? Because someone else was there . It was his way of telling us where to look . He said the mainframe was useless . There would be no ... " refuge . " I knew I could trust you , Sydney . - Straight to the airstrip . No stops . - [ Engine Starts ] The transfer plane is meeting us just after first light . [ Car Engine Starts ] - You gotta be kidding me . - What the hell is goin ' on ? Let 's go , junior . We got places to be . [ Coughing ] [ Broots ] Miss Parker , what 's goin 'on ? Jarod . [ Car Approaching ] - Miss Parker . - Get him in the truck ! - Where are you going ? - Just get him out of here now ! Get in . - [ Engine Cranking ] - Get out ! Dad . - [ Coughing ] - Oh ! Damn ! Who are you ? I 'm you . [ Angry Chattering ] - You were the problem . - You need to get off my back . [ Chattering Continues ] [ Clanging ] Carelessness ... leads to chaos ... chaos to anarchy ... anarchy to ruin . This is the Centre . Ruin ... is not an option ! - Mutumbo , if I may - - Excuses are only yesterday 's failures . Only solutions matter now . Mutumbo , we all-we all want the same thing here : The boy and Jarod back . I am listening . So we fumbled the kid . We intercepted Jarod 's father . He 's our trump card . - Let 's play him . - [ Miss Parker ] And I guarantee you , sir . You give me 10 minutes with Major Charles ... and I 'll have every answer you want about where Jarod and the boy are . Brigitte will handle Major Charles . Thank you . If I may , sir - You will honor my wishes . Good answer . In the meantime , we have Jarod and the boy to track down . Mr. Lyle will lead that effort . [ Miss Parker ] Sir , with the possible exception of Sydney ... I know Jarod better than anyone here ... and he will not allow that boy to be captured . Yes . But what you are forgetting is the boy himself . He wasn 't raised to cooperate . Especially with Jarod . I 'm just saying it 's a waste of manpower and money to go after Jarod ... when the key to it all is the man sitting down in Renewal Wing . - Daddy . - Well , uh , Mutumbo has a good plan here . We need to follow it . [ Mutumbo ] Then it is settled . Two points of attack . Two generals , one plan . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Chattering ] Now I know what dirty laundry feels like . - Not here , angel . - Yes , here . How could you just stand there while Mutumbo shut me out ? For God 's sake , we 're talkin ' the Triumvirate here . Every action , every thought , every word I utter could be a death sentence . We both know I 'm the one who should be down there with Major Charles . And we both know sometimes I have to play things the way I play things ... whether you like it or not . " Play . " Oh , my God . We 're talking about the man who killed Mom . We 're talking about our family . I 'm talking about survival . The things I do , choices I make ... you probably never will understand . Tell me , Daddy . Are you really afraid of Mutumbo ... or what I may find out from Major Charles ? [ Elevator Bell Dings ] I thought I was off your Christmas card list . You were . Until our nosy little bald friend Broots confirmed my suspicions with this . You left e-mail for Jarod in a box called " refuge . " You let him know when and where to find the boy . I had you pegged for the wrong witch in Oz , Sydney . I 'm sorry I doubted you . I 'm sorry I wasn 't able to confide in you . Or in Broots either . Human cloning - I ... don 't think I probably would have believed you anyway . When I went down to talk with the boy , it was , um - It was so surreal being with him . It was like I was suddenly 11 years old again . And yet - And yet ? And yet the boy is Jarod ... in every way except the most important one . He doesn 't have Jarod 's soul . And he didn 't have you . Miss Parker . When I found out they had made another Jarod ... I knew that if I didn 't take control ... something important would be lost . If facing Major Charles is important enough to you ... then go . Take it . And everyone else be damned . [ Thunderclap ] [ Jarod ] Must be some matches around here somewhere . Aha . Yes . Little light in here . There we go . [ Thunder Rumbling ] You cold ? It 's probably too damp out there to hunt for firewood ... but maybe I can break up some of these old chairs . I don 't understand . Why are you so afraid of me ? - Is this a bad man ? - [ Raines ] Very bad . - What did he do ? - [ Wheels Squeaking ] This is the man who killed your parents . How can one feed such a terrible lie to a child ? Raines could feed candy to a diabetic and sleep like a baby . He doesn 't seem like a killer . He seems sad , Mr. Raines . Like there 's this void in his life that 's depriving him of any true happiness . Perhaps loss of a loved one . Or the loss of family . Maybe he feels the same way I do ... not knowing who he is or where he came from . You 're not concentrating . He 's no different from any of the others . I don 't know . I just - I feel I have a connection with him . - This boy 's good . - Mmm . Almost as good as the real thing . Wait a minute . What am I saying ? He is the real thing . [ Raines ] If you can 't find him ... he 'll go out and kill another little boy 's parents ... just like he killed yours . Do you understand me ? Good . [ Jarod ] I swear to you I had nothing to do with the death of your - [ Thunder Rumbles ] Of your parents . - Then what happened to them ? - It 's complicated . You 're a gifted young man . You have the ability to grasp difficult concepts . When I was a boy I used to look in the mirror and think about my past ... try to picture my future . - Do you ever do that ? - Yes . But I can 't see a past . When I was a boy ... I was stolen from my parents ... and I was held prisoner at the Centre . [ Thunderclap ] They exploited my mind . They made me do things . Things I never should have done . The same kind of things that they made you do . When I got older , I realized that they were using these things to hurt people . Even to kill them . So I ran away . You escaped . Yes . But not all of me . They kept part of me behind . Some of my - Some of my D.N.A. I guess they had a plan . A way to always keep me prisoner . I don 't understand . I think you do . If you could look into that mirror and see your future ... it would look exactly like ... me . But my parents . They don 't exist . They never did . At least not in the way you were taught . No . You 're lying . Mr. Raines said you were clever . You 're lying . I wish to God I was . But I 'm not lying . I 'm sorry . I want to show you something . That 's me when I was your age . [ Young Jarod ] No . I can 't do it ! - [ Young Sydney ] You shut down now , you all die ! - I 'm you ? - I come from nowhere ? - You come from here . And I come from two people who love me very much . [ Thunder Rumbling ] It 's okay to cry . I can 't . Mr. Raines won 't let me . [ Thunderclap ] - [ Young Miss Parker Screams ] - [ Young Sydney ] No ! Keep her back ! - Keep her back . - [ Young Jarod ] Leave me alone ! [ Young Miss Parker ] Mama ! [ Sobbing ] [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Water Dripping ] You can beat me all you want . I 'd rather die than give up my son . You 're going to die , but it 's not about your son . It 's about my mother . You look just like her . You should know . You killed her . That 's my gun . The one you used to shoot her . No . It 's the one a man named Raines stole from me the day your mother was killed . She knew trouble was coming . [ Chuckles ] Why should I believe that ? Because it 's true . It was the day I was supposed to help her rescue Jarod and two other children . Raines shot me , left me for dead ... took my gun . I still carry the bullet in my back . You bought yourself another second . Talk fast . Your mother located me . She knew I was searching for Jarod . She was afraid of something called the Triumvirate . She said we 'd have to move fast - that this Triumvirate threatened her husband ... because of her action to rescue the children ... and her opposition to something she called Gemini . - They threatened Daddy ? - They threatened his wife and his daughter . You were the other child we were trying to rescue . Your mother was gonna take you to Europe the next day . Don 't you remember ? My father knew about these rescues ? My rescue ? That was how I saw it . But I can 't be certain . But I do know for sure ... your mother was scared for your safety and his . Afraid of how the Triumvirate controlled him . Raines was the Triumvirate watchdog then . He 's still howling . I didn 't understand why he took my gun all those years ago , but I do now . All your mother and father ever wanted was what I wanted : To love and be with our children . - [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Jarod ] Good morning . - [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Jarod ] Good morning . Breakfast . That isn 't wheat grass and tomato juice . No . That 's what they feed you . It 's called ice cream . You 'll never forget the first bite . Go ahead . Try it . Go ahead . - [ Chuckles ] - Mmm . It 's very good . There are so many incredible things in the world to try . Hope they 're all as good as ice cream . So , what are we gonna do now ? Right now I have to figure out a way to get my - our father out of the Centre . Maybe we should trade them for something just as important . I can 't believe I doubted him . All these years . All these years I 've - I 've wondered why Daddy hid things from me ... lied to me , dissuaded me from digging into her past ... but it was all for my own good . We all want to believe that our parents have our best interests in mind . But - I finally find some peace of mind , and you want to lobotomize it ? Isn 't there an apparent conflict between your newfound joy ... and your loading of this weapon ? It 's very simple . Raines dead ... me happy . Not an easy man to kill . Can 't help it if you 're a lousy aim . I don 't plan to miss . Miss Parker . Y-You both . - You gotta come quick - to the lobby . - Later , Broots . Oh , no , no , no . Trust me . You 're not gonna believe this . - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - He 's right here . Move . Remember me ? [ Miss Parker ] Where 'd you find him ? [ Sam ] We didn 't . He came in on his own . Three years on the run , and it 's finally homesickness that brings you back . Well , actually , I came to cut a deal . Broots , go get my father . [ Jarod ] Oh , he 's not in his office . What kind of game is this ? It 's a simple one . You 'll get your father back ... when I get mine . So you 're proposing an equal trade . Your father for my husband . I wouldn 't say that it was equal , but it will do . Yes . And how do we know you 're not bluffing ? [ Gun Cocks ] Seeing is believing . I 'll call you in two hours to arrange the exchange . One of you will bring me my father . - Only one . - That 'd be me . That 'd be Sydney . Sydney ? This is my father we 're talking about . Our father . All the more reason to keep cool heads . Sydney 's the only person I can trust to play by the rules . - Where will the exchange take place , Jarod ? - Like I said , I 'll call you . I wouldn 't want anybody showing up early and complicating things . I really have to go now . Do you want to see your father again ? Alive ? - [ Wheels Squeaking ] - And you let Jarod walk right out ? He has my father ! And we had him ! I made the only move there was , you son of a bitch ! It was your last one , Miss Parker . The Centre 's chain of command is clear . As long as Mr. Parker is absent ... Mr. Raines is in charge . And your plan is , Mr. Raines ? We organize two Sweeper teams . Once we know the location , one will scout and secure - [ Wheezing ] And the other will execute . No . No . No . You 're gambling with my father 's life . We do this just as Jarod said . Well , Raines 's experience with Jarod is just administrative . Look ... - I know how this guy 's mind works . - This is not a democracy . My decision stands . [ Phone Ringing ] - Jarod . - [ Jarod ] Interstate Road 40 . Iversonville , North Carolina . At 3 : 00 . Not 2.59 . Not 3.01 . 3 : 00 . - That barely gives enough time for Sydney to - - Then he 'd better get moving . Jarod , I want to talk to my father . - Daddy , are you there ? - [ Beeps ] Sydney , go . - [ Door Opens ] - Get Major Charles . Let 's move . [ Wheels Squeaking ] Like I said , two teams . [ Wheezing ] And I 'll need our best sharpshooter . I 'm your man . Jarod will not walk away from this . No . I want Jarod alive . And the boy too . It 's Mr. Parker who 's outlived his usefulness . That waste of skin Raines is gonna get my father killed . Well , I don 't think Jarod would hurt your father . I don 't think . Jarod 's been searching for his father his entire life ... and he 's gonna do whatever it takes to get him back . I could see it in his eyes . - Well , then what do you think we should do ? - Same thing . Whatever it takes . Miss Parker . Jarod isn 't the only enemy this time . Don 't worry , Bridget . I wouldn 't forget about you . I know what you think of me ... but believe me , we both want the same thing this time . Mr. Raines is planning to kill your father . Why should I believe you ? Because if you don 't , somebody we both love very much is going to die . With or without you , I 'm going . Let 's do this together . Please . [ Major Charles ] I 'd like to thank you , Sydney . - What for ? - For raising my son . What he 's become is a reflection of you . What was he like as a child ? Someone a father would feel very proud to call his son . I 'm sorry you never had that chance , Major . In fact , I can 't imagine anything worse ... than what you 've had to endure . I can . - Not ever finding him at all . - [ Jarod On Walkie-talkie ] Sydney , are you there ? Yes , Jarod . You 'll see a road a quarter of a mile up . Turn right . My father will know where to go from there . [ Sydney On Walkie-talkie ] All right , Jarod . I 'll follow his instructions . Well , he - he didn 't say where . Only that his father knew . Great . We 're in the middle of nowhere with no Sydney ... and no idea where he 's going . - I know exactly where he 's going . - Yeah ? Well , where might that be ? To the beginning of this little odyssey . [ Sighs ] Well , I gotta hand it to you . Capturing the king is inspired . Walking into the Centre to cut your deal . - Real bold . - Not bold . Prudent . Necessity . Exhibition of resolve . You people only understand one thing : Power . Whatever it was , it was brilliant . No wonder my people have such a hard time catching up to you . Of course , that 's why we want you back . 'Cause you 're brilliant . I 'm not going back . Neither is he . I do have one question . It 's your nickel . Why ? Why do you do it ? Why the Centre ? Give and take . For a cause bigger than both of us . Oh , hell . I don 't expect you to understand it ... but in the end , it does all add up . You steal children . You create them . How does that add up ? Rape , incest , murder . Survival . Given enough incentive , man is capable of almost anything . [ Car Approaching ] It 's time to go . Dad . Now take care of your father . And of yourself . Thank you , Sydney . Come on , Dad . Jarod . I 'm glad you found your family . [ Car Rapidly Approaching ] - I told you . Sydney comes alone ! - Jarod , I had no choice . They 're planning to kill my father . - Who ? - [ Helicopter Approaching ] Daddy , get back ! - I 've got him . - Shoot him ! [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] - God , no ! - [ Jarod ] She 's losing a lot ofblood . Keep this compressed against the wound . [ Raines ] Forget Parker . Stop the plane ! Jarod , let 's go ! - You go ahead without me ! - Jarod . That boy needs a father . Now go ! We 'll catch up later ! I love you , Son ! I love you too , Dad . Go ! Go ! Go ! [ Jarod 's Voice ] I 've got to get her to the hospital . You 're not going anywhere . Looks like you 're out of luck . Now , you want to do this the easy way , or do you want to end up like her ? Stop him ! Welcome back to the Centre , Jarod . Angel , don 't leave me . Don 't leave me , angel .

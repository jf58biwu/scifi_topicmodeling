That 's why none ofthe volunteers come back . They all get a pardon . Some come back , I heard . Please put me back ! Don 't take me ! They got 'em up on the seventh floor . They hide 'em up there . They 're all messed up in the head . You don 't know they 're all messed up . Nobody 's seen 'em . And maybe they 're not messed up . That 's a rumor . Nobody knows that . I don 't believe that . Good luck , man . - Volunteer duty ! - I didn 't volunteer . You causing trouble again ? No , no trouble . These are the instructions for the first time probe .

For a man in your position , an opportunity . Not to volunteer could be a real mistake . Definitely a mistake . " Yet among the myriad microwaves ... the infrared messages , the gigabytes of ones and zeros ... we find words , byte-sized now ... tinier even than science ... Iurking in some vague electricity . But ifwe but listen ... we hear the solitaryvoice ofthat poet telling us ... yesterday this day 's madness did prepare ... tomorrow 's silent triumph of despair . Drink , for you know not whenceyou came , norwhy . Drink , for you know not whyyou go , norwhere . " Wandering around in nothing but his underpants ... and one ofthose plastic , see-through lady 's raincoats . So , they get there , they ask the guy real nice for some kind of ID . He gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses . Totally irrational , totally disoriented . Doesn 't know where he is , what day ofthe week it is . All they got was his name . They figured he 's stoned out ofhis mind . Some kind of psychotic episode . - He 's been tested for drugs ? - Negative for drugs . But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs . - No drugs . You believe that ? - He 's in restraints . Yeah . Weren 'tyou listening ' ? I 've got two police officers in the hospital ! The medic gave him enough Stelazine to kill a horse . He 's rarin ' to go . That would explain the bruises , I guess . The struggle . Yeah . You wanna go in there , examine him ? Yes , please . Is this all you have ? Ran it through your system ? No matchup . No license , no prints , no warrants .

Nobody ever calls me that . - Haveyou been a patient at County ? - No . - Have I seen you someplace ? - Not possible . I need to go ! I 'm supposed to be gathering information . - What kind ofinformation ? - Won 't help you . Won 't help anyone . Won 't change anything . James , doyou know whyyou 're here ? 'Cause I 'm a good observer . I 've got a tough mind . You don 't remember assaulting a police officer ? Why am I chained ? Why are these chains on me ? You 've been in an institution before , haven 'tyou ? - Or hospital ? - No ! Now I need to go . Need to go ! - Haveyou been in prison , James ? - Underground . Hiding ? I love this air .

Come on , let 's go . Hey , Goines ! Yo , Goines ! Yo , Jeffrey ! - What ? - Look here . This here 's James . Now , do me a favor . Why don 'tyou show him around ? Tell him the TV rules . Show him the games and stuff . Okay ? How much you gonna pay me ? How much ? I 'd be doin ' yourjob . - Five thousand dollars . That enough ? - Five thousand ?

Nowyou got it . Okay , it 's all in good fun . Here 's some games here . And there 's- - Get out ! Get out ! He was in my chair . Games . Games . Here 's some games . Games that wanna get out . See ? More games . Games , theyvegetizeyou . See ? Ifyou play the games , you 're voluntarily taking a tranquillizer . I guess they gaveyou some chemical restraints . Drugs ! What 'd they giveyou ? Thorazine ? Haldol ? How much ? How much ? Learn your drugs . Knowyour dosages . It 's elementary . - I need to make a telephone call . - A telephone call ? That 's communication with the outside world . Doctor 's discretion . Ifall ofthese nuts could just make phone calls ... it could spread insanity oozing through telephone cables ... oozing to the ears ofall these poor , sane people , infecting them . Wackos everywhere . A plague of madness . In fact , very few , Jim- - Jim , very few of us here are actually mentally ill . I 'm not saying you 're not mentally ill . For all I know , you 're crazy as a loon . But that 's not whyyou 're here . You 're here because ofthe system . There 's the television . It 's all right there . All right there . Look , listen , kneel , pray . The commercials ! We 're not productive any more . Don 't make things . It 's all automated . What are we for then ? We 're consumers , Jim . Okay , okay . Buy a lot ofstuff , you 're a good citizen . But ifyou don 't buy a lot of stuff , what are you then ? What ? You 're mentally ill . Fact , Jim . Fact ! Ifyou don 't buy things : toilet paper , new cars ... electrically operated sexual devices ... stereo systems with brain-implanted headphones ... screwdrivers with built-in radar devices , voice-activated computers- - Take it easy , Jeffrey . Be calm ! Right . That 's right . You 're a very attractive woman . Ifyou want to watch a particular TV program , like All My Children ... go to the nurse , tell her the day , the time the showyou wanna see is on . Butyou have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on . This guywas always requesting shows that had already played . Yes . No . You have to tell her before . He couldn 't grasp the idea that the nurse couldn 't make it beyesterday . She couldn 't turn back time ! Thank you , Einstein . Now he , he was nuts . He was a fruitcake , Jim . Okay , that 's it , Jeffrey . You 're gonna get a shot . - I warned you . - Right . I got a little carried away ... explaining the innerworkings ofthe institution toJim . I don 't really come from outer space . Oh . L.J. Washington . He doesn 't really come from outer space . Don 't mock me , my friend . Get outta my chair ! It 's a condition of mental divergence . I find myself on the planet Ogo . Part of an intellectual elite ... preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on Pluto . But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in all ways ... nevertheless , Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche . I am mentally divergent ... in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities ... that plague my life here . When I stop going there , I will be well . are you also divergent , friend ? This is a place for crazy people . I 'm not crazy . We don 't use that term , " crazy , " Mr. Cole . You 've got some real nuts here ! I know some things that you don 't know . It 's gonna be very difficult for you to understand it . I 'm not gonna hurt anyone ! All right . Look , have any ofyou heard ... ofthe Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys ? They stencil this on the sides ofbuildings everywhere . Haveyou seen this ? Haveyou seen this ? Why don 'tyou just takeyour time ... and try to explain this from the beginning ? Right , right . It 's 1 990 . Okay , that makes sense . Theywouldn 't have been activeyet . Five billion people died in 1 996 and 1 997 . Almost the entire population ofthe world . Only about one percent of us survived . - are you going to save us ? - How can I ? This already happened . I can 't saveyou . Nobody can . I am simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present ... trace the path ofthe virus . We 're not in the present now , Mr. Cole ? 1 990 is the past . This already happened . That 's what I 'm trying- - You believe 1 996 is the present then , is that it ? No ! 1 996 is the past too . Listen to me . What I- - What I- - What I need to do is make a telephone call . I can straighten this out ifl make a telephone call . Who would you call ? Who would straighten everything out ? The scientists . They 'll want to know that they sent me to the wrong time . I can leave a voice mail message that they monitor from the present . Can I just make one telephone call , please ? Please ? What are you doin ' in the dog bowl ? Get outta there ! Who put those Doritos in there anyway ? Yes ? What ? Voice mail ? Look , I don 't know- - Stop makin ' that noise ! I don 't know whatyou 're talkin ' about . Is this a joke ? I don 't know any scientists . Duanne , get out- - James who ? Wasn 't whoyou expected ? No . It was some lady . She didn 't know anything . Well , maybe it was the wrong number . No . That 's why they chose me . I remember things . James , where did you grow up ? Dr. Railly . I have the strangest feeling I 've metyou before . Wait . This is 1 990 . I 'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1 996 ! It 's not the right numberyet ! That 's the problem ! I have a message forthem . Won 'twork . Can 't open it . You thinkyou can remove the grill , butyou can 't . It 's welded . See ? Told you . All the doors are locked too . They 're protecting the people on the outside from us ... when the people on the outside are as crazy as us . Do you know what " crazy " is ? Crazy is " majority rules . " Yeah . Take germs , for example . Germs ? In the 1 8th century , no such thing . Nada . Nothing . No one ever imagined such a thing ! No sane person , anyway . Along comes this doctor . Semmelweis ! Semmelweis comes along , trying to convince people , other doctors mainly ... that there are these teeny , tiny , invisible bad things called germs ... that get intoyour body and makeyou sick . He 's trying to get doctors to wash their hands . What is this guy ? Crazy ? Teeny , tiny , invisible- - " What doyou call 'em ? Germs ? What ? " Now , cut to the 20th century . Last week , in fact , right before I got dragged into this hellhole ! I go in to order a burger in this fast-food joint . The guy drops it on the floor . Jim , he picks it up , wipes it off . He hands it to me like it was all okay . " What about the germs ? " I say . He says , " I don 't believe in germs . Germs are a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soaps . " Now , he 's crazy , right ? See ? There 's no right . There 's no wrong . There 's only popular opinion . You , you , you believe in germs , right ? I 'm not crazy . Of course not ! You wanna escape , right ? That 's very sane . I can help you . You want me to , don 'tya ? Getyou out ? You know how to get outta here ? Yes , my son ! - Then why don 'tya ? - Why don 't I try to escape ? Good question . Very good question . Intelligent . Because I would be crazy to escape . I have sent out word . - I am all taken care of . - What does that mean ? I 've managed to contact certain underlings , evil spirits ... secretaries of secretaries and other assorted minions ... who will contact my father . And when my father finds out I 'm in this kind of place ... he 'll have them transfer me to one ofthose classyjoints ... where they treatyou properly , like a person , a guest ! With sheets and towels like a big hotel ... with great drugs for all of us nut-case , lunatic , maniac devils ! Sorry . Sorry . I got a little agitated . The thought of escape crossed my mind . And suddenly- - Suddenly I felt like bending the fucking bars back ! And ripping out the window frames and eating them ! Yes , eating them ! And leaping , leaping , leaping ! Colonics for everyone ! I 'm a mental patient . I 'm supposed to act out . Wait 'll you morons find out who I am ! My father 's gonna be really upset . And when my father gets upset , the ground shakes . My father is God ! I worship my father ! These dramatic videotapes , secretly obtainedbyanimal rights activists ... have arousedpublic indignation . But manyscientists vehemently disagree , Torture experiments . - We 're all monkeys . - They hurt you ? Not as bad as what they 're doing to the Easter Bunny . Look at them . They 're just askin ' for it . Maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out . Wiping out the human race ? It 's a great idea . It 's great . But more of a long-term thing . First we have to focus on more immediate goals . I didn 't say a word aboutyou-know-what . - What are you talking about ? - Your plan . Emancipation . What are you writing ? You a reporter ? It 's private . A lawsuit ? You gonna sue 'em ? Yo , Jimbo . Time for your meds . Take a chance , Live the moment , Sunshine , Gorgeous beaches , The Florida Keys ! We 'll returnyou to the Marx Brothers in Monkey Business . Monkey business ! Fetch ! Get it ? Monkey . Monk key . What ? Ifyou see a bearish future in the decade ahead ... consider the changes sweeping the world and the opportunities they offer . " And the opportunities they offer . " Ooh ! They really dosed you . J im ! Major load . Danger , Will Robinson , danger . You gotta get it together . Focus , focus , focus . Remember the plan . I did my part ! What ? Not " what . " When . - When ? - Yes . When .

Five hundred dollars . I got $ 500 . I 'm insured ! Yeah ! A window of opportunity is opening now . Now is the time for all good men to seize the moment . The moment !

Two 's not working today . Use one . Kathryn , this was in my box ! But I have a slight suspicion it wasn 't meant for me . " You are the most bootiful woman I have ever seen . You live in a bootiful world , butyou don 't know it . You have freedom , sunshine , airyou can breathe- - " James Cole , right ? " I would do anything to stay here but I must leave . Please help me . " Okay , okay , okay . Poor man . Hey , Kathryn ? James Cole is one ofyours , right ? He eloped . Last seen , he was up on two . Shit ! We have to know exactly what 's there so we can fix it . Doctor , we have a visitor . May I help you ? Excuse me ? Hey , Jimbo . What 's up , man ? All right , it 's okay . Take it easy . - It 'll be all right . - Take care . Take it easy . We 'll work this out , okay ? Send you back toyour room . A little milk and cookies , you 'll be all right . Just take it easy , okay ? Calm down ! Take him down ! Take him the fuck down ! I 'm not gonna hurt anyone . Dr. Railly , help me , please . - We 'll giveyou something to calm you . - No ! No more drugs ! James , we have to do this . You 're very confused . Kathryn , we 've been working together for fouryears . I 've never seen you like this before . So please stop being so defensive . This isn 't an inquisition . I didn 't think I was being defensive . I was trying to explain exactlywhat- - He should 've been in restraints . It was bad judgment on your part , plain and simple . Why not own up to it ? Okay , it was bad judgment . But I have the strangest feeling about him . - I 've seen him before and I 'm trying- - - Two policemen are in the hospital . Now we 've got a security guard with a skull fracture . I said it was bad judgment ! What else doyou want me to say ? You see that ? See what I mean ? You 're being defensive . Isn 't she being defensive ? We have another situation . - He was fully restrained ? - Yes , sir . I did it myself . And he was fully sedated ? He was fully sedated . are you trying to tell me a fully sedated , fully restrained patient ... somehow slipped out that vent , replaced the grill behind him ... and is wriggling his way through the ventilation system ? Watch it ! You sure fucked up ! - Where are you ? - Ah , you can talk ! My name 's not Bob . Not a prob , Bob . Where 'd they send you ? - Where are you ? - Another cell . Maybe . What doyou mean " maybe " ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Maybe means ... maybe I 'm in the next cell . Anothervolunteer likeyou . Or maybe I 'm in the Central Office ... spying on ya for all those science bozos . Or , hey ... maybe I 'm not even here . Maybe I 'm just in your head . No way to confirm anything . - Where 'd they send ya ? - 1 990 . '90 ! How was it ? Good drugs ? Lots of pussy ? Hey , Bob , you do the job ? You find out the big info ? Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys ? It was supposed to be 1 996 . Science ain 't an exact science with these clowns . But they 're getting better . You 're luckyyou didn 't end up in ancient Egypt . Shh ! They 're comin ' . The Freedom for Animals Association on SecondAvenue ... is the secret headquarters ofthe Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys , They are the ones who are going to do it , I can 't do any more , I have to go now . Have a merry Christmas . - Wel l ? - What ? Did you or did you not record that message ? It 's a reconstruction of a deteriorated recording . Weak signal . We have to put them together one word at a time . We just finished rebuilding this . Did you or did you not make this call ? I couldn 't make any call . You sent me to thewrong year . It was 1 990 . - You 're certain ofthat ? - What 'd you do with your time , Cole ? Did you waste it on drugs ? Women ? - Theyforced me to take drugs . - Forced you ? Whywould someone forceyou to take drugs ? I was in trouble . I got arrested . I did whatyou wanted . I got a specimen , a spider . I didn 't have anyplace to put it , so I ate it . Butyou sent me to the wrong year , so it really doesn 't matter . Did you see this when you went back ? No , sir , I don 't think so . What about these people ? Did you see any ofthese people ? No . Oh , wait , wait . Him ? You saw that man ? Maybe in the mental institution . You were in a mental institution ? Oh , God . Cole , you were sent back to make some very important observations . You could 've made a real contribution . Helped us to reclaim the planet . As well as reducing your sentence . The question is , Cole , doyou want another chance ? Last connection going on . No mistakes this time , Cole . Stay alert . Keepyour eyes open . We 're thinking about the spider , Cole . Try and do something like that again . Just relax now . Don 't fight it . We 're sending you to the third quarter of 1 996 . Right on the money . I don 't understand ! What ? I don 't understand ! - Where am I ? - I gotta find 'em ! I gotta find 'em ! Help me ! I don 't know where I am . - You gotta help me find 'em ! - Jose ? - Jose ! - Cole ! Cole , where are we ? - Help me , Cole ! - Oh , God , wait ! " In a season ofgreat pestilence ... there are omens and divinations . And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels ... seven golden vials full of the wrath of God ... who liveth forever and ever . " Revelations . In the 1 4th century , according to accounts of officials ofthat time ... this man appeared suddenly in the village ofWyle near Stonehenge ... in April of 1 362 . Using unfamiliarwords and speaking in a strange accent ... the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence ... which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years . Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling ... when reality supports it with a virulent disease ... whether it 's the bubonic plague , smallpox or AIDS . Nowwe have technological horrors as well ... such as chemical warfare , which first reared its ugly head ... during the deadly mustard gas attacks ofWorld War I. During such an attack in the French trenches in October of 1 91 7 ... we have an account ofthis soldier ... who , during an assault , was wounded by shrapnel ... and hospitalized , apparently in a state ofhysteria . Doctors found he had lost all comprehension of French ... but that he spoke English fluently ... albeit in a regional dialect they didn 't recognize . The man , though physically unaffected by the gas ... was beside himself . He claimed that he had come from the future ... that he was looking for a pure germ ... that would ultimatelywipe mankind offthe face ofthe Earth ... starting in theyear 1 996 . Though injured , theyoung soldier disappeared from the hospital ... no doubt trying to carry on his mission towarn others ... and substituting for the agony ofwar ... a self-inflicted agony we call " the Cassandra complex . " Cassandra , in Greek legend , was condemned to know the future ... but to be disbelieved when she foretold it . Hence , the agony offoreknowledge , plus the impotence to do anything about it . I 'm going right out to get vaccinated . I think , Dr. Railly , you 've given alarmists a bad name . I have ? There 's real data that the planet cannot survive the excesses ofthe human race . - This is true . - Proliferation of atomic devices . Uncontrolled breeding habits . Pollution ofland , sea and air . The rape ofthe environment . In this context , it 's obvious Chicken Little represents the sane vision ... and that Homosapiens ' motto , " Let 's go shopping " ... is the cry ofthe true lunatic . Please , Dr. Railly . I wonder ifyou 're aware of my own studies . Seeyou at work tomorrow . I 'll giveyou a call tomorrow . Get in the car ! I 've got a gun . Get in the car . Drive . Take my purse . I 've got a lot of cash , credit cards . - Take my keys . - Start the car ! Here , turn right . Turn right here . - Where are we going ? - Philadelphia . - That 's more than a hundred miles . - That 's why I can 't walk there . - Just let me go . - Just drive ! - You can take the car . - I don 't know how to drive . I went underground when I was eight . I told you that before . At the next- - - At the next corner , turn right . - Cole.James Cole . You escaped from a locked room six years ago . Six years for you . Come on . Turn around ! Get goin ' . I can 't believe that this is a coincidence , Mr. Cole . - Haveyou been following me ? - You said you would help me . I know this isn 't whatyou meant , but ... I don 't have any money . I hurt my leg . I 've been sleeping on the street . I 'm sure I smell bad . Doyou have any food in this car ? - You have been following me ? - No . No , I saw this ... in a store window . I can read , remember ? Why doyou want to go to Philadelphia ? I checked out the Baltimore information . It was nothing . It 's in Philadelphia . That 's where the ones who did it are . TheTwelve Monkeys . Is that a radio ? Can you turn it on ? This is apersonal message toyou , are you at the end ofyourrope ? are you dying to get away ? The Florida Keys are waiting for you , Ocean waves- - I 've never seen the ocean . It 's an advertisement , Mr. Cole . What ? It 's an advertisement . You understand that , don 't you ? It 's not really a special message toyou . Mr. Cole . - You used to call meJames . - You prefer that ? James , you don 't really have a gun- - Can you turn this up ? Can you make this louder ? I foundmythrill On Blueberry Hill When I foundyou I love the music ofthe 20th century . I love this air . Love to breathe this air ! WXBXnews break , News as it happens , Roger Pratt reporting , A story breaking now is emergency crews are converging on a corn field ... where playmates ofnine-year-old Ricky Neuman say ... he disappeared before their eyes , Young Neuman apparently stepped into an abandoned well shaft ... and is lodged somewhere in the narrow 1 50-foot pipe , Possibly alive , possibly badly injured , playmates heard him cry out faintly , - Never cry wolf . - What ? My father said that to me . He said , " Never cry wolf . " Then people won 't believe you if something really happens . If something really happens like what , James ? Something bad . Can we have some more music , please ? I don 'twanna hearthis stuff . Can we hear more music ? - Isee trees ofgreen - Oh , that 's good . That 's good . I 'veseen them bloom Forme andyou And I think to myself What a wonderful world Hello , Dr. Railly ? This is Wikke from Psych Admitting , Do you rememberJames Cole ?

It 's the same dream I always have . When I was a kid . And I was in it ? What did I do ? You were very upset . You 're always very upset in the dream . Just never knew it was you . It wasn 't me before , James . It 's become me now because ofwhat 's happening . Could you please untie me ? No , I think it was always you . Very strange . You 're flushed and you were moaning . I thinkyou 're running a fever . What are you doing ? In Fresno , California , crews continue to attempt to rescue Ricky Neuman , Closer to home , in Baltimore , Kathryn Railly ... prominent psychiatrist and author of a newly released book on insanity ... disappeared mysteriously last night after a lecture at the university , Former mental patientJames Cole is wanted for questioning ... regarding Dr. Railly 's disappearance , Authorities warn that Cole has a history of violence ... and advise anyone spotting him to notify authorities at once , I love this m usic . We don 't have this . We don 't have anything like this . What are all those ? These ? My notes , clues . What kind of clues ? It 's about the secret army . The Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys . They 're the ones that spread the virus . That 's why I 'm here . I have to find them . That 's my mission . Have to locate them because they have the virus in its pure form ... before it mutates . When I locate them , they 'll send a scientist back here . That scientist will study the virus . When he goes back to the present , he and the scientists will make a cure . Police officers from threejurisdictions ... apparentlyincluding special tactical unit personnel ... have now been mobilized to control the growing thousands of onlookers ... here in Fresno , California , Does that disturb you ? No . Thought it was about us . Thought maybe they 'd captured us and arrested me . J ust a joke . I remember being very afraid for that little boy . All alone , down that well ... not knowing if anybody 's gonna get him out . First time I was really afraid when I was a kid . What doyou mean , " when you were a kid " ? Never mind . Just a prank , a hoax . That boy 's hiding in a barn . " There are omens and divinations . One ofthe four beasts gave unto the seven angels ... seven golden vials full ofthe wrath ofGod ... who liveth forever and ever . " You won 't think I 'm crazy when people start dying next month .

Don 't kill me , don 't kill me ! Stick around , bitch . are you all right ? Is he alive ? Go ahead . We 're runnin ' out oftime . - You can 't help him . - Oh , Jesus ! James , you killed him ! All I see are dead people . Come on . - Come on . - You never had a gun before ! I have one now . Come on . Come on ! " Dragons in their pleasant palaces . The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ... and there came- - " You ! You 're one of us . This is it . Come on . Can we help you ? It 's just a tape . I 'm looking for the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys . We don 't know anything about an Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys so just disappear . - Just want some information . - Didn 'tyou hear me ? Don 't hurt her ! Please , I 'm a psychiatrist . Just do whatever he tells you to do . He 's disturbed . He 's dangerous . - Please just cooperate . - You want money ? - We only got a few bucks . - I told you what I want . Get down . Lock that door . Lock it now ! - I told you that Goines would get us- - - Shut up ! - Goines ? - Jeffrey Goines ? Jeffrey becomes this big star , and the media latch onto him ... because he 's picketing his own father ... a famous Nobel-prize-winning virologist . You must have seen all that on TV . I don 't watch TV . Is this him ? Yeah , that 's him , that 's him . What are you gonna do to us ? Tell me more aboutJeffrey . Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do- - picketing , leafleting , letter-writing stuff . He said we were ineffectual , liberal jerkoffs . He wanted to do guerrilla actions in order to educate the public . - Like this ? - He let 1 00 snakes loose in the Senate . But we weren 't into that kind of stuff . It 's counterproductive . We told him . So he and 1 1 guys , they split off ... and formed this underground army . The Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys . See ? They started planning a " human hunt . " They bought stun guns , nets and bear traps . Theywere gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers . They didn 't do it , of course . They didn 't do any ofit . Like always , Mr. Big Shot sold his friends out . What does that mean ? He goes on TV and gives this big news conference , tells the world ... he just realized his dad 's experiments are vital for humanity ... and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary ... that from now on , he , Jeffrey Goines , will personally supervise the labs ... to make sure all the little animals aren 't going to suffer . What is this ? People like that aren 't accessible . You can 'tjust barge in on them . - It 's not how theworld works . - Be quiet and drive the car . - I know what I 'm doing . - No , you don 't . This car is stolen , and we are in big trouble . Big trouble . Ifyou don 't turn yourself over to the police , they 're going to kill you . They 're going to shoot me , too , because I 'm an accessory to murder . - You 're all going to die . - Nobody is going to die . You 're not going to save the world , okay ? You 're delusional . You 've made all this up out ofbits and pieces in your head . - No . - Yes ! Let me giveyou an example . You knowJeffrey Goines . You were both patients at County Hospital . Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake . He told you that his fatherwas a famous scientist who worked with viruses ... soyou incorporated that information to this cockeyed fantasy . He didn 't say his fatherwas a scientist . He said his fatherwas God . This is insane . Prominentpsychiatrist andauthor Dr. Kathryn Raillyhas been abducted ... by a dangerous mental patient , James Cole , Cole was under Railly 's care sixyears ago ... when he made a dramatic escape- - - What is the matter with your leg ? - I got shot . Shot ? Who shot you ? I don 't know . It was some kind of war . Never mind . You wouldn 't believe me anyway . What are you doing ? - We don 't need gas . - I thoughtyou didn 't know how to drive . I said I was tooyoung to drive . I didn 't say I was stupid . This can 't go on . if you have a bullet in your leg , I have to take care ofit . I 'm a doctor . I need some supplies . Meanwhile , in Fresno , California ... where mining engineers continue their attempt ... to sink a shaft parallel to the one in which Ricky is believed trapped ... authorities say there is still a chance the boy might be alive , You shouldn 't put your weight on it . You need stitches and antibiotics . Lucky for you , it 's near the surface . I love seeing the sun . Wait . Let me help you . You smell so good . You have to give yourself up . You know that ? What are you doing ? James ? - I 'm sorry . - What are you doing ? - Stop it ! What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . Let go of me ! - They find him ? - Who ? - That kid , the one in the pipe . - You believe that ? They 're lowering a monkey down there ... with an infrared camera strapped on him ... and a roast beef sandwich wrapped up in tin foil . - You 're makin ' it up . - I shityou not , man . - Life is reallyweird . - A monkey and a roast beefsandwich . Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner ... and this most stimulating and exciting company ... for itself , with no sense of purpose . But , alas , I am burdened . Forwith all this excess of public attention and cacophony of praise ... there comes great responsibility . I don 't have to tell you all that the dangers ofscience ... are a timeworn threat . From Prometheus stealing fire from the gods- - What friend ? I 'm not expecting anyone . But never before- - This is ridiculous . My father 's giving a major address . ... to fear the power ... we have at hand . Normally , ifwe caught a guy ... sneaking around with no ID , we 'd bust his ass . Excuse my French . This one says he knows you . Sinceyou seem to have had a few unusual associates ... we certainlywould not want to arrest one of your closest pals . Never seen him before in my life . Feel free to torture this man , orwhatever it is you do . I 'm going back to listen to my father 's eloquent discourse on the perils of- - I 'm here about some monkeys . - Monkeys ? - Monkeys , yes . Twelve ofthem . Arnold . - You look like shit . - You know this man ? Of course I know this man . Arnold Pettibone . Gee , Arnie , it 's black tie . I said , " Drop by . " But it 's Dad 's big do- - VI Ps , senators , secret service . You hungry , Arnie ? Real killer feast we 're putting on . Lots of dead lamb , dead cow , dead pig . Shall we ? Hi . How are you ? Hello . Very attractive . " The Great Escape , " 1 990 . Watch it ! Huh ? County Hospital ? Am I right ? I can 't do anything aboutwhatyou 're going to do . I can 't change anything . I won 't stopyou . I can 't stopyou . - I justwant the information . - Come on . Hi , ladies . So nice to seeyou again . Watch your step on the way down . All right . Who blabbed ? Bruhns ? Weller ? I justwant access to the pure virus . - Virus ? - I need to know where and what it is . I get it . I see whatyou 're up to . It 's your old plan , isn 't it ? - What plan ? - Your plan . - I don 't know whatyou 're talking about . - Yes , you do . We were in the dayroom watching television ... and you were upset about the desecration ofthe planet , which I understand . Then you said , " Wouldn 't it be great to have a germ orvirus ... that would wipe out mankind and leave the animals and trees ? " - You 're trying to confuse me . - You were so funny . I told you my father was this famous virologist . You said , " He could make a germ , and we could steal it . " - You were so funny . - They mutate ! We live underground ! The world belongs to the dogs and cats . We live like worms . I just need the information ! - Take it easy . - You are a nutcase , completely deranged ! Delusional , paranoid . Your process is all fucked up . Your information tray is jammed , man . Doyou know what it is , the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys ? It 's a collection of space-case do-gooders saving rain forests . I have nothing to do with those bozos anymore . I 've quit being the rich-kid fall guy for a bunch ofineffective fanatics ! So much for your grand plot , asshole ! My father has warned people about the dangers ... of experimenting with DNA viruses foryears . You processed that information through your addled , paranoid infrastructure . Lo and behold , a nonprofit organization ... becomes a sinister , revolutionary cabal ! This man is complete bat shit ! Ladies and gentlemen ... doyou realize where he thinks he comes from ? Captain Dan Miller , the man in charge ofthe rescue operation ... says he has consulted with experts ... and they assure us there will be no negative- - If you ask me , the monkey 's gonna eat that goddamn sandwich himself . Did a man just come running through here ? His primaryresponsibility was to the missing boy , Police say that the body of a woman ... foundstrangled in Knutson State Park ... could be kidnapping victim ... Dr. Kathryn Railly , Anybody see someone come through here ? The body was discovered less than an hour ago by hikers , But we have an unconfirmed report that the victim ... a woman in her late 20s or early 30s ... was savagely mutilated , Earlier in the day , police located Railly 's abandoned car , It was found not far from- - Any sign of him ? Nothing . He can 't just disappear . You bastard ! I could have died in there , you son of a bitch ! What are you thinking of ... you twisted sack of shit ? Sorry I locked you in the trunk . I 'm sick of you . What have you done ? Did you kill somebody ? Yes . - A million people , five billion people . - What ? Jeffrey Goines said that it was my idea about the virus . We were in the institution . It was all so fuzzy with the drugs . Doyou think It was my idea ? Doyou think maybe I wiped out the human race ? Nobody is gonna wipe out the human race . Notyou orJeffrey or anybody else . You 've created something in your mind . - Mentally divergent ? - Whatever . A substitute reality ... because you don 't want to deal with anything . I would love it ifthat was true . It can be dealt with , but only if you want to . I can help you . - They 're after me . - Who is after you ? We have to get out of here . There were policemen at that party . Party ? You went to a- - Never mind . It 's important you surrender instead ofthem catching you running away . Wouldn 't it be great ifl was crazy ? Then the world would be okay . - Give me the gun . Where is the gun ? - I lost the gun . I could live right here . You got water , air , stars . - I 'm gonna attract their attention . - Debris . I 'm gonna attract their attention so they know where we are . I love this world ! They 're gonna tell you to putyour hands on your head . Do what they say . I love the frogs , the spiders . I 'll be with you . I 'll help you . I won 't let them- - Then I said something about cooperating , and he said he would do that . So I got in the car . Thanks . And when I- - I started honking the horn , and when I got out , he was gone . I tell you something . You lucked out . For a while we thoughtyou were a body found down state , mutilated . - He wouldn 't do that . - This the man he attacked ? I want to be clear about this , okay ? This man and the other one were severely beating us . James Cole didn 't start it . In fact , he saved me . Funny thing , Doctor . Maybeyou can help explain it to me , you being a psychiatrist and all . Why do kidnap victims always tell us about the guys that grabbed ' em ... and they try to make us understand ... how kind these bastards reallywere . It 's a normal reaction to a life-threatening situation . He 's sick , okay ? He thinks he comes from the future . He lives in a meticulously constructed fantasyworld that 's disintegrating . He needs help . Exhaustedbut apparently unharmed byher 30-hour ordeal ... Dr. Railly returned to Baltimore without making a public statement , The author and psychiatrist is currently in seclusion at her home , Meantime , police have pieced together a scenario ofthe series of events ... that began with escaped mental patientJames Cole- - - Sorry . - No , it 's okay . I ' m just hyper-alert . I can 't sleep . - Did you take a sedative ? - I hate those things . They mess me up . With the kidnapping ofthe Baltimore woman , James Cole ... is now also wanted in connection ... with the brutal slaying ofRodney Wiggins , an ex-convict from Ardmore , His body was discovered in an abandoned theater ... not far from where Cole left 3 animal rights activists bound and gagged ... in their SecondA venue headquarters , Now , do they real ly bel ieve that he 's going to show up here ? Please . In Fresno , California , the cornfield that wasjammed with spectators- - He 's dead , isn 't he ? That little boy . He 's fine . It was just a prank he and his friends pulled . The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky Neuman from an abandoned mine shaft ... endedabruptly when playmates confessed ... that Neuman 's disappearance was a prank , In fact , the missing child was hiding in a nearby barn , I found my thrill On Blueberry Hill On Blueberry Hill When I foundyou Congratulations , Cole . Wel I done . Wel I done . During your interview , while you were under the influence ... you told us you liked music . - This isn 't a prison , James . - This is a hospital . - Until you recoveryour equilibrium . - You 're still a little disoriented . - Time travel is a very stressful thing . - You stood up verywell , considering . You connected theTwelve Monkeys with a famous virologist and his son . - Others will take over now . - We 'll be back in service in months . We 'll retake the planet . This is whatyou 've been working for . - A full pardon . - You 'll be out of here in no time . - Women will want to get to knowyou . - I don 't wantyourwomen ! I want to get well ! And you will be well , James . Soon . You know , you people don 't exist . You 're not real . We can 't travel back in time . You 're not here . You can 't trick me . You 're in my mind . I am insane , and you are my insanity . He not only used the word " prank " ... he said the boy was hiding in a barn . Kathryn , Kathryn , he kidnapped you . You saw him murder somebody ... and you knew there was a real possibility ... he could kill you too . You 're under tremendous emotional stress . For God 's sake , Owen , listen to me . He knew about the boy in Fresno ... and he says five billion people are gonna die . No way he could possibly know that . You 're a rational person . You 're a trained psychiatrist . You know the difference between what 's real and what 's not . What we say is the truth is what everybody accepts , right ? Psychiatry is the latest religion . We decide what 's right and wrong . We decide who 's crazy or not . I 'm in trouble here . I 'm losing my faith . Yousure fuckedup , Bob , But I can understand , You don 't wantyour mistakes pointed out toyou , I can relate to that , old Bob , I know whatyou 're thinkin ' , You 're thinkin ' I don 't exist except in your head , I can see that point ofview , Butyou could still talk to me , couldn 'tya ? I saw you ... in 1 996 , in the real world . - You pulled out your teeth . - Why would I pull out my teeth , Bob ? That 's a no-no , And when didyou sayyou saw me ? - In 1 872 ? - Leave me alone ! Yellin ' won 't getyou whatyou want , You have to be smart to get whatyou want , - What do I want ? - You don 't know whatyou want ? Sure you do , Bob , You know whatyou want , You tell me . Tell me what I want . To see the sky and the ocean ... to be topside ... breathe the air ... to be with her , Isn 't that right ? Isn 't that whatyou want ? Bob ? J im Halperin , Philly PD . Sorry to call you so early . You found him ? Is he okay ? No , no . Au contraire , Doctor . No sign of your good friend , the kidnapper . However , the plot does thicken . I got a ballistics report here on my desk . It says the bullet you claim you removed from Cole 's thigh ... is , in fact , an antique . Andall indications are ... it was firedsometime prior to the 1 920s , - How about I take a spin down there ? - This can 't be . You and I can grab a bite to eat ... and maybe you could revise or amplify your statement . You can 't trick us , you know . It wouldn 't work , No , sir . You haven 't become addicted , have you ... to that dying world ? No , sir . I just want to do my part to get us back on top ... in charge of the planet . And I have the experience . I know the people involved . He really is the most qualified . But all that behavior . You said we weren 't real . I don 't think the human mind is meant to exist ... in two different ... whateveryou called it , dimensions ? It 's just too stressful . You said thatyourself . It 's very confusing . You don 't know what 's real and what 's not . Butyou know what 's real now . Yes , sir , I do . No , I don 't know anything about ... a monkey army , Doctor . No , nothing whatsoever . Good Lord , if my son was ever involved in something like that- - Yeah ? Well , I 'm sorry . I think it 's doubly inappropriate to discuss ... security matters with you , Dr. Railly . But ifit will easeyour mind ... rest assured that neither my son ... nor any other unauthorized person ... has access to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory . Is that clear toyou now ? Thank you so much for your concern . Women psychiatrists ! I attended a lecture ofhers once . " Apocalyptic Visions . " She was suddenly struck ... by the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey . Has she succumbed to her own ... " theoretical " Cassandra disease ? Maybe we ought to review our security procedures . Perhaps upgrade ' em , you know ? Beef 'em up . Let 's consider again our current information . Ifthe symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia ... on December 27 , 1 996 , that makes us know that- - It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 1 3 , 1 996 . And was seen sequentially after that in- - San Francisco , New Orleans ... Rio deJaneiro ... Rome , Kinshasa ... Karachi , Bangkok , then Peking . That was verywell done . if you 're in there , I have to talk toyou ! It 's the kidnap woman . The one who was with the guywho tied us up . Turn offthe lights . Turn offthe light ! - What 's she doin ' ? - She 's drawing attention to us . I don 't knowwhatyou 're up to , butyou 're gonna get us in deep shit . Walkies ready , batteries charged ? I sawyou ! I saw somebody in there ! Secret experiments . That 's what they do . Secret , weird stuff . - Not just on animals . - I know you . - Do ' em on people too down at- - - Have you seen James Cole ? They 're watching you . - Takin ' pictures . - The police . I know . Look . I have to contact James . It 's very , very important that he 's really careful when he reaches me . Doyou understand that ? - Good . - Who 's James ? He was with me . He spoke toyou several weeks ago . He said thatyou were from the future and thatyou were watching him . Bolt cutters . Did you get the bolt cutters ? One dozen . They 're in the van . - The plans for the security system ? - All right here , committed to memory . - You know what she 's doin ' out there ? - What 's it say ? I can 't see it . Forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand . Your psychiatrist ? - Did you just sayyour psychiatrist ? - Ex-psychiatrist . This woman was your psychiatrist ... and now she 's spray-painting our building ? What 's it say ? - What ? - There 's a policeman over there . - Pretend you don 't know me . - I want to turn myselfin . - Where is he ? - James ! Down ! No , it 's okay . I 'm not crazy any more . I mean , I am . I 'm mentally divergent . I know that now . I wantyou to help me . I want to get better . Let 's get outta here . He 's going . Go ! - I 've seen that before . - No , you haven 't . A guy in a Ford is chasing her and some other guy I can 't see . No problem . It 's probably just another kidnapping ... featuring Jeffrey 's shrink . Pardon me . Make that ex-shrink . This is your leader ? A certifiable lunatic ... who told his former psychiatrist all his plans ... for God knows what wacko irresponsible schemes ? God knows what she 's written on that wall ! Who cares what psychiatrists write on walls ? You think I told her about the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys ? Impossible ! Doyou know why ? Doyou know why ? Because , you pathetically ineffectual ... and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals , I 'll tell you why . Because when I had anything to do with her sixyears ago ... there was no such thing , I hadn 't thought ofityet . Then how come she knows what 's going on ? Well , here 's my theory on that . When I was institutionalized , my brain was studied exhaustively ... in the guise of mental health . I was interrogated , x-rayed . I was examined thoroughly . Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer ... where they created this model of my mind . Yes ! Using that model ... they managed to generate every thought ... I could possibly have in the next ten years ... which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind ... to determine everything I was gonna do in that period . So , you see ... she knew I was gonna lead the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys ... into the pages ofhistory before it even occurred to me . She knows everything I 'm ever gonna do before I know it myself . How 's that ? Kweskin , you finish here . I 'll meet you there . And if you forget one thing , I 'll have you shaved , sterilized and destroyed . - Jeff ? - What ? You 're a great man . Fuck the bozos ! He 's seriously crazy . You know that . There . Over there . Okay . Come on . - I need a room . - Thirty-five bucks an hour . - An hour ? - You want quarter hours ? Go someplace else . Here 's ... twenty-five , six , seven for an hour . Deal ? One hour , honey babe . Number 64 . Sixth floor . Up the stairs , end ofthe hall . Elevator 's busted . She 's not " honey babe . " She 's a doctor . My psychiatrist . Understand ? Whatever gets it up for you , Jack . Tommy , this is Charlie over at the Globe . You know ifWallace has a new girl ? Sort of a rookie type ? A little weird ? Does fantasy acts ? Okay , you were standing there looking up at the moon . You were splashing through the water , and then what ? I thought I was in prison again . Just like that , you were in prison ? No , not really . Likeyou said , It was all in my mind . You disappeared . One minuteyou were there , the next minuteyou were gone . Did you run through thewoods , or- - I don 't know . I don 't remember . The boy in the well . How did you know that was just a hoax ? It was ? I didn 't know . You said he was hiding in a barn ! I think I maybe saw a TV show about that ... when I was a kid where a boy- - It wasn 't a TV show ! It was real ! Maybe this boy saw the same TV show that I did ... and he copied it . Look , you were right . I am mentally ill . I imagined all these things , these people . I know they 're not real . I can trick them . I can make them do what I want . I worked on ' em a little bit . I got back here to get better . - I can stay here . - What does this mean to you ? I think I had a dream about this . You had a bullet from World War I in your leg . How did it get there ? I don 't know . You said I had delusions , that I created this world . - You said you could explain . - I can 't ! I 'm trying to , and- - I can 't believe that everything we say or do has already happened . We can 't change what 's gonna happen . And iffive billion people are gonna die , it 's- - I want the future to be unknown . I want to become a whole person again . I want this to be the present . I want to stay here this time ... with you . Doyou remember sixyears ago you had a phone number ? - It was the wrong number then . - A woman answered . It was the wrong number in 1 990 . It should be the right number now . Doyou remember it ? The number . This is myterritory , bitch ! - Is this real or one ofmy delusions ? - This is definitely real . Excuse me . I thinkwe 've got a little misunderstanding here . - Yeah . We- - - Gee , really ? Now , you just sit tight , chief . You listen to me , little Miss Understanding . You thinkyou can go around me and peddleyour ass in this part oftown ? You betyour lifewe got what I would call ... a majorfuckin ' misunderstanding . James , no ! Don 't ! Put him in the closet . Take his money first ! - You want me to rob him ? - We need cash ! Call the cops ! Call the cops ! What 's goin ' on ? I 've got friends , man . Don 't fuckin ' kill me . No , James ! Open the door ! What the fuck are you doing ? Please don 't hurt him . Open the door . James , come on . Just in case- - Just in case I 'm not crazy , this is how they find us . By our teeth . I don 't want them to find me ever . I don 't want to go back . Step back . You 'd better load . Police ! Throw yourweapons out and come on out ! Hey ! Is that the cops ? I 'm the innocent victim here . I was attacked by a coked-up whore ... and a fuckin ' crazy dentist . Try to blend in . Oh , Jesus ! Come on . There 's gotta be a phone around here somewhere . Over there . Look . I 'm gonna try that number , okay ? Let 's hope it 's nothing . It 's okay ! We 're insane . We 're crazy . It 's a carpet cleaning company . - A carpet cleaning company ? - Yeah . No superiors . No scientists . No men from the future . It 's just a carpet cleaning company . They have voice mail . You leave a message telling whereyou wantyour carpet cleaned . - You left them a message ? - Yeah , I couldn 't resist . Wait till they hearthis nuttywoman telling them towatch out ... forthe Army oftheTwelve Monkeys . I said , " The Freedom for Animals Association on Second Avenue- - " " Is the secret headquarters of the Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys . They 're the ones who are gonna do it . I can 't do anything more now . I have to go . Have a merry Christmas . " You couldn 't have heard me . They gotyour message . They played it for me . It was a bad recording , distorted . I didn 't recognizeyourvoice . This . And this . And this . Is everything okay ? You want anything ? Shall I put this on your account , ma 'am ? No . That 'll be cash . Can you tell mewhat floor the wigs are on ? You turned the thing into a fucking computer . - And Fale believed it . - You know Fale . He 's like , " if you guys get nailed , which I 'm pretty sureyou will ... I 've never seen you before in my fuckin ' life . " Come on , come on . Bring him through . Drive ! What 's the harm in opening ' up the bag ? His eyes are taped , right ? Right ? Hello . Hello . Wanna hearthe monkey speak ? Jeffrey ? Jeffrey , I know that 's you . - I recognizeyourvoice . - No , you don 't . I also know all about yourwarped little plan . That lady , your psychiatrist ? She told me . I didn 't believe her . It just seemed too crazy , even for you . But just in case , I took steps ... to make sure that you couldn 't go through with it . I don 't have the code any more . I don 't have access to the virus . I took myself out ofthe loop . Too late ! Too late ! We 've got plans for you , Dad . I never let myselfbelieve it . Now I know it 's true . Jeffrey ? You 're completely insane . No , I 'm not . There 's a cross section ofone of the old trees that 's been cut down , Here I was born , And there I died , It was only a moment for you , You took no notice , I think I ' ve seen this movie before . - When I was a kid , I saw it on TV . - Don 't talk . - I did see it before . - Tall trees , have you been here before ? - Yes , - When ? - But I don 't recognize this- - - When wereyou born ? - Long ago , - Where ? What 's the matter ? Tell me , Madeleine , tell me , It 's just like what 's happening with us . Like the past . The movie never changes . It can 't change . But every timeyou see it , it seems different because you 're different . You see different things . Please don 't ask me , if you can 't change anything because it 's already happened ... you may as well smell the flowers . What flowers ? It 's an expression . Why are you doing this ? I want to know why . What ifI 'm wrong ? What if you 're wrong ? What ifl am crazy ? In a few weeks , it will have started or it won 't . Ifthere 's still ... football games , traffic jams ... TV shows and armed robberies ... we 're going to be so glad ... that we 'll be thrilled to see the police . I 'm responsible for you now . The Chinese say onceyou 've saveda person 's life ... you 're responsible for it forever , so I 'm committed , Do you have a plan ? I have to know . There 's so little that I know . You said you 'd never seen the ocean . Hurry up . Come on . Jeffrey ? You know I can 't see . Where are we ? Jeffrey ? Please . We have 9 : 30 reservations for KeyWest . I just didn 't recognizeyou . Well , you look pretty differentyourself . It was always you . In my dream . It was always you . I rememberyou like this . You do ? I felt I 've known you before . I feel like I 've always known you . I 'm so scared . What time 's your flight , friends ? - 9 : 30 . - Might be tight . Tight ? No . Mywatch says 7 : 30 . On your normal morning ' , okay . Plenty oftime . But todayyou gotta take into account your Army ofthe Twelve Monkeys factor . What ? What 'd you say ? Twelve Monkeys . In case you folks didn 't turn on your radio this mornin ' . Bunch ofweirdos let all the animals out ofthe zoo . Then they locked up this big-shot scientist in one ofthe cages . Scientist 's own kid one ofthe ones did it . They 've got animals all over the place . Bunch ofzebras closed down the thruway about an hour ago . And they got some thing called an emu . It 's got traffic blocked for miles on 676 . What do theythink they 're accomplishing byreleasing an animal like this ... into a city like this one ? That 's what they were up to- - freeing animals . On the walls . It said , " We did it . " They meant the animals . I think it 's gonna be all right . Tell your people ifthey spot either one ofthem not to try and apprehend them . They should notify us . We have people all over the airport . We 'll take care ofit . - I know this place . - Airports all look the same . This is my dream . - Your mustache . - It 's not just my dream . I was actually here . I remember now . About a week or two before everyone started dying . Careful . They might be looking for us . - I was here as a kid . - Use this . I thinkyou were here then too . Ifthey identify us , they 're going to send us someplace ... but it won 't be KeyWest . I 'll go fix this . I 'm gonna get the tickets . I 'll meetyou in the newspaper stand . Judy Simmons . I have reservations for KeyWest . - I don 't see a lot ofthis . It 's cash . - It 's a long story . We 'll begin boarding in about 20 minutes . - You have a nice flight , Miss Simmons . - Thank you . Hello . How are you today ? I don 't knowwhether you 're there or not .

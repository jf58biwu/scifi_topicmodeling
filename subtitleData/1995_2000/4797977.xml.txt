 I hate the cold . It must have been 80 below back there . You want to talk cold ? Try starting your car up on a winter morning in Detroit . If your coat bunches up in the back leaving some skin showing , you hit that vinyl seat ? Yeah , now this is more like it . I 'd say . Did anyone see a water fountain ? Or a Pizza Hut ? My blood sugar 's running a little low . We better find something soon because we 've got five days till the slide . Five days ? We could die out here . Maybe not . Huh . I knew you 'd come through , farm boy . So what you got on your mind , huh ? You know how to make an animal snare out of your shoelaces or something ? No . Someone 's coming . Hello . Howdy . Do you think you could give us a ride to town ? Maybe it 's a mirage . What in the name of Samuel T. Colt are you all doing out here ? It 's hot enough to burn the blueberries off a Brahma bull . Very colorful mirage . We got separated from our wagon train . One of our horses got snake bit and the rest of them ran off 'cause my friend here forgot to hobble them . Well , why didn 't you say so ? Go on . Get aboard before you fry your frijoles . Two of you better get up here on top ' cause we ain 't got a lot of room back there . Hey , bro , where 'd you come up with that story ? Happened to me once . Prom night . And better shake your bootstraps . We 're in Mr. K 's territory . Mr. K ? How 're you all doing ? Just fine , ma 'am . Now that I 'm graced with such a beautiful traveling companion . Who 's this Mr. K ? Oh , only the low-downdest varmint this side of the big muddy . And ugly ? He is so ugly that when he was whelped , the doctor horsewhipped his mama . No , that 's a fact ! Did he say " varmint " ? Him and his boys been raising hell all over these parts . Stampeding cattle . Burning out homesteaders . They got this whole territory spooked . So mean he once shot a man for snoring ? Yeah , you heard of him . They say he 's got a face that 'd scare the ugly off a $ 2 whore . But I don 't want to get close enough to him to find out . Hooch ? So what brings you out west , Miss ... Beckett , Maggie . Maggie . Well , actually , we 're just passing through . What about you , Mister , uh ... Call me Ben . I 'm traveling on business . It 's Mr. K ! It 's Mr. K ! Hey , give us some cover . Give us some cover ! Colin ! We lost Colin ! Stop the stage ! Stop the stage ! Oh , man ! Colin ! Stop the stage ! Stop the stage ! We got to go back for Colin ! Are you loco ? We left him ! That 's Mr. K ! Pal , you want to join him ? Throw down that strongbox ! What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? I 'm sorry about your friend . Anything I can do to help , I 'm staying at the Palace Hotel . Thanks . Well , now what ? See if we can rustle up some help . Did he say " rustle " ? Uh-huh . Okay , so , what 's the story here ? Something has delayed this world 's technological advancement by about 150 years . Could be one of a million things . All these guns are making me jumpier than a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs . Sorry , it 's catchy . The longer we wait the slimmer the chances we have of finding Colin alive . Doesn 't anybody in this town knock anymore ? You scared the hell out of me ! Sorry . You are the sheriff ? Well , what does it say on the door you didn 't knock on ? Undertaker . Oh . Well , he 's upstairs . Downstairs it says sheriff . Now , what do you want ? We were attacked . Our friend got knocked off the stage about 10 miles outside of town . He was shot and could be seriously hurt . He was shot by someone by the name of a Mr. K ? Mr. K , do you say ? Well , that 's what the driver said . Well , what the hell you want me to do about it ? You 're the law . I want you to help us find him and the man who shot him . The buzzards are probably picking at his bones by now . You want my advice , is just do your grieving and move on . Thank you . You 've been a terrific help . If that sheriff 's too yellow to help us find Colin , we 're just gonna have to find him ourselves . Yellow ? What ? You called the sheriff yellow . No , I did not . Did . Hi ? Hello ? Could we get some customer service here ? Just hold your horses . Would you just ... Did you get it ? Hold your horses ? You run the livery service ? Livery , saloon , dentist 's office . I 'm expanding . Not much future in law enforcement . That 's terrific . We 'd like to rent a couple of horses . Show me the money . Whoa , whoa ! You know , if I was looking for an outhouse , that 'd do just fine . What ? I don 't know where you come from , son , we haven 't used paper money around these parts since the recession of ' 74 . I don 't suppose you take credit ? Nope . But I might be able to work out a trade . See , I need a little songbird to entertain my saloon customers . Excuse me ? You know , nothing fancy . Just perch up on the piano , bat them beautiful eyes , and maybe , you know , flash a little ankle . I don 't think the lady is interested . Why , that 's a shame . For a short-term contract , I could fix you up with a couple of horses , throw in the tack and gear to boot . Forget it . Well , it 'd be a pity if your friend was left lying out there in the desert . We got fire ants . Did I tell you that ? Little bitty scutters , but bite ? They just ... You know , I saw a fellow once fall into a nest of them , swole up something terrible before he died . Heard him screaming two counties over . Okay . Two shows a day , three on Saturday , room and board and you keep the tips . Now , any private arrangements are strictly between you and the customers . Why , Miss Beckett , you 're a vision . Yeah , I clean up pretty good . Stake a lady to a drink ? I didn 't realize you were an entertainer . Neither did I. I won 't be making a career out of it , I 'll tell you that much . Yeah , it 's just as well . Saloons like this are on their way out . Folks coming West these days are looking for a more family-oriented experience . Something for the wife and kids to do . Not just drinking , gambling and girlie shows . I ain 't paying you to drink my whiskey . How about giving them pipes a workout ? I guess I 'm on . Excuse me . I don 't suppose you know any Madonna . De Camptown races sing this song Doo-da , doo-da De Camptown racetrack five miles long Oh , de doo-da day Going to play all night Going to play all day Bet my money on the bob-tailed nag Somebody bet on the gray Came down with my hat caved in Doo-da , doo-da I go back home with a pocket full of tin Oh , de doo-da day This looks like the place . Yeah . Colin ! Colin ! It 's Colin 's shirt . Maybe somebody carried him off . And took him where ? Yeah . Well , don 't look at me , Kemo Sabe . I can 't even tell you when the BART is coming without a schedule . Damn . I 'd lie still if I were you . Where am I ? You 're on our ranch . I found you out by Jawbone Wash . You 're just a boy . Am not . Name 's Ellie . Ellie Starr . Someone put a hole through you . Rest easy , mister , or I 'll put another one in you . You one of Mr. K 's boys ? No . But I think the piece of lead in my shoulder belonged to him , though . Ellie , you got chores . Ma . Now . The slug missed the bone or you would 've lost that arm . Now , if this came from Mr. K 's gun like you say , you got to be damn lucky . He doesn 't miss . You know him ? He put one of these in my husband 's back . Walk across the floor in those tight pants Will you bust a seam when you do that dance , baby ? Tight pants ! Making me steamy Tight pants ! I know that you want me , baby Tight pants ! I can see romance Tight pants ! I love those tight pants Put them in the wash Put them in the dryer Shrinking them tighter I can sing higher Tight pants ! Everybody sing it ALL . Tight pants ! I know that you want me , baby Tight pants ! Place seems a little dead . All right , folks . I 'm gonna be taking a little break . That was fun , huh ? Just remember to tip your server . Wait . Come back ! I don 't appreciate being shot at . Didn 't realize you were on the stage . Man 's got to make a living . I thought that 's what I was here for . Easy , boys . No use in spatting . We 're all gonna make a lot of money together . You told me the homesteader problem would be taken care of by the time I got here . Don 't worry about it . Mr. K has been doing a fine job putting together properties for development . Those dirt farmers are sitting on land we need . I said don 't worry about it . Well , I am worried about it . If we can 't lock up this land , this whole deal falls apart . Looks like the songbird got out of her cage . Let go of ... My God . What 's the matter , missy ? Never seen a real gunfighter before ? Ever see a real toothbrush before ? There 's no need to drag her into this . What do you care ? You sweet on her ? What were you doing out there ? I was ... I was looking for the boss . I 'm done with my first show . I was hoping I could get out of this wardrobe and freshen up a little , maybe , before dinner . Baths is two bits . Four bits if you want fresh water . I 'll take it out of your pay . Now , get out of here . Do I know you ? I don 't think so . I 'd remember your face . I 'm sure you would . Oh , here now . You shouldn 't be up . I need to get into town , ma 'am . My friends are probably looking for me . Well , then , let them find you . You 're not gonna be getting far with that wound , mister . My name 's Colin Mallory . That 's a big gun . It was my father 's . He was in the army . He fought with General Schwartzkopf at Gettysburg . I told you not to touch that . Can you shoot ? My Daddy said a man 's got to know how to use a gun . And look where it got him , hmm ? Mean hombres . Yep . Back from Wormhole Gulch . Aiming to do some drinking or some duking . Yep . Your chaps hurting you as much as mine are ? Yep . You didn 't find him ? Well ... We found some wagon tracks . Someone may have picked him up . Who ? We lost the trail . Great . Well , we 've got another problem . Mr. K 's in town . And it seems he 's an old friend of ours . What ? Kolitar . Kolitar , the Kromagg ? No , Kolitar , the care bear . When we sprung him from the slide cage , this must have been the world he bounced back to . Talk about the good , the bad and you 're really ugly . How did he know that we were on that stagecoach ? I don 't think he did . He didn 't recognize me in this get-up . But I overheard him talking to the sheriff and that Ben guy about some scam they have to steal the land away from the homesteaders . Maybe we got in the middle . Some of the homesteaders might have picked up Colin . We 've got to check out all the local ranches in the area . There 's probably a list of deeds over at the land office . We 're going to have to keep these horses for a spell longer . All right . Well , just find Colin before I owe my soul to the company store , if you know what I mean . Evening , little lady . A hearty appetite is a good sign . I know it 's not my place , but if I could say something , ma 'am . It 's pretty clear the girl misses her father . It most certainly is not your place . I know you 're trying to protect her , but don 't let her grow up ashamed of her feelings . What would you know about our feelings ? I don 't ever want Ellie to grow up not remembering what a good , kind , loving man her father was . But I will not raise her around men who think that every problem can be solved with a gun . Ma ! Ma ! Your strength seems to be coming back , Mr. Mallory . I 'll run you into town in the morning . Ma ! What is it ? Ellie ! Oh , my God . You may recall , I had a business transaction going with your husband that was never satisfactorily concluded . Please , just let my daughter go . Excellent . Now we 're negotiating . I have something you want and you have something I want . You son of a bitch . Hand over the deed to this little patch of dirt and your daughter walks away from this with a minimum of emotional scarring . All right . Just don 't hurt her . Leave the ladies alone . You . I know you , pilgrim . Yes , you do . Don 't . Go to your mother . Move out . This ain 't over . I ain 't never seen nobody shoot like that . Killing is nothing to be proud of . Help me . Help me get him into the house . Oh , my . Sliders ! Now I know where I 've seen that dance hall floozy before . You know these people ? Oh , yes . You say there are two more ? Yep . Black fella and a white fella . Rented them some horses . Well , it can 't be a coincidence . They must have followed me here . Things are just starting to come together . We can 't afford to have them meddling in our plans . Don 't worry . I 'll see that they don 't . ... M-C-A That was incredible . I 've never heard those songs before . Well , " Y.M.C.A. " is always a show-stopper . And those dance moves you do , that 's a bit spicier than I 'm used to seeing . Too much ? Oh , no . Actually , I was wondering if you 'd like to join me for dinner tonight . Corral your ponies there , Bronco Billy . A song and a dance is all you get for the price of admission . What ? Oh , no , you misunderstand . I just thought we could talk . You see , when I was watching you , you are so self-assured , so in control . You can keep 100 drunken cowboys nailed to their seats with just a look in your eye and your attitude . Stop . It 's very powerful , Maggie . And I find powerful women very attractive . Well , I guess a girl 's got to eat . You know , with your talent , I bet you could help me with my new project I 'm working on . What project is that ? Ben Siegel thinks big , Maggie . You see , I got a plan to change this little one-horse burg into a Mecca , a crossroads . Everyone coming West will stop right here in Las Vegas , Nevada . Las Vegas ? Don 't you even know what town you 're in ? Ben Siegel ? " Bugsy " Siegel ? That was my grandfather . He didn 't like that name very much , I can 't say I do either . You trying to cheat me ? What are you trying to pull ? Oh , no ! Quinn ! Nobody cheats Quinn Mallory ! The land office has claims on three more ranches south of town that we haven 't checked yet . If we head out now , we should get there by first light . Yeah . Somebody picked up Colin . That 's why we haven 't found him yet . And no news is good news . Quinn ! Quinn . Tell me you just didn 't shoot a man in cold blood in the saloon . What ? That 's what I thought . You 've either got a really hot-tempered double on this Earth , or Kolitar knows you 're here . Now , why would he want to frame you for murder ? Kolitar and his gang are trying to scare off the homesteaders . Yeah . According to the land office , Sheriff Redfield and a Mr. K.R. O 'Magg have been snapping up all of their property . And Bugsy 's waiting in the wings to put his casinos on it . Bugsy ? Yeah . Our friend , Ben , from the stage . Ben Siegel III . Doesn 't that tell you something about human nature ? I mean , this whole world doesn 't even have indoor plumbing yet , but they 've got the mob . Yeah . Well , I 'm not going to sleep with the fishes because Kolitar 's afraid I 'm going to mess up his little scheme . Man shouldn 't ride after dark . It 's awfully easy to make a misstep . You know I didn 't do it . Well , I wasn 't there , but there 's about 50 eyewitnesses said you did do it . I guess I 'm gonna have to take you in . And your friends , too , for aiding and abetting . I sure am gonna miss my little songbird . Tweet , tweet . We 'll find her . Lock them up . Oh , that hurts . Now look what you 've done to my good sewing . I 'm sorry . Sorry I messed up your yard . Where 'd you learn to shoot like that ? I grew up on a farm . Everybody had to know how to shoot . Shoot raccoon , deer . But I learned never to aim a gun at another person . It was one of my father 's rules . It was one of my husband 's rules , too . After he came back from the war , he was , uh , changed . He put that big pistol of his in a box and never touched it . So Mr. K shot him in the back . Got to get into town . Now that Kolitar ... Mr. K knows I 'm here , he 'll go after my friends . I 've got to help them . No . You 're not going anywhere . You 've lost too much blood . He 'll kill them . Well , you can 't be much help to them if you 're dead . Do they have to do that right out where we can see it ? I think that 's the point . That 's cold , man . I mean , that is really cold . Well , how we doing this morning ? Fine . You seem to be limping a bit . Well , don 't you worry about it . Oh , and your friend 's gonna be joining you real soon . She 's a feisty little thing , isn 't she ? Look , isn 't that a bit premature ? I mean , we haven 't even seen the judge yet . Well , ask and you shall receive . Hear ye , hear ye , hear ye . The circuit court of the great state of Nevada is now in session . Do you have anything to say in your defense before I pass sentence ? I didn 't do it . So noted . The court sentences you both to hang by the neck till you 're dead . Oh , and by the way , don 't forget to try them grits this morning . Esther Mae can work herself around a skillet . Mmm . You know , you 're really getting on my nerves . You ran out on me last night . I thought we had a date . Mmm . The man may be a low-down lying polecat , but he wasn 't lying about them grits . Oh , Lord . Somebody stop me from talking like this . You know , we have the advantage here . Okay , framed for murder , iron bars , necktie party ... Am I missing something here ? Think about it . We have seen every cowboy movie ever made . We know every trick in the book . And on this world , movies aren 't invented yet . I 'm sorry I ruined your evening . Just a little disappointed . I thought we 'd have made a good team . So , at least you 'll have the satisfaction of watching me hang . That would be overreacting . Are we talking about me and my friends exposing your plan to murder , intimidate and defraud the locals out of their land ? I was talking about you standing me up last night . Oh . So you 're not going to turn me in to the sheriff ? Didn 't plan on it . Then why are you holding that gun on me ? 'Cause that 's my horse you 're stealing . Oh . Here . You might need this . Things are getting a little too crazy for me around here . I thought you were in business with Redfield . I was . He promised to have the land available if I come up with the capital to start the casinos . I didn 't know he hired gunslingers to run off the homesteaders . See , my grandfather might have done things that way . I don 't . Well , maybe I 'll try Reno . I need your help . My friends are gonna hang . From what I saw , your pal , Quinn , deserves it . All right , this is really difficult for me to explain , okay ? But I really believe he was framed . If I could just find Colin , maybe we can find a way to bust him out . Colin ? I heard Mr. K talking to the sheriff about someone by that name . Says he 's holed up in a ranch outside of town . Says he 's gonna take care of him right after he strings up your friends . Did he say where ? Climb up . Let 's go . You ready ? Yeah . Guard ! Guard ! Guard ! Escaped ! Quinn 's escaped ! You don 't expect me to fall for that , do you ? I saw this trick in The Man Who Shot Kaleeth-Tar . Why did you frame me ? Why did you follow me here ? We didn 't . You expect me to believe that ? In an infinite number of worlds , you just happened to end up on the same one I did . Look . We released you from the slide cage , why would we follow you ? Why do you humans do anything ? Meddlesome vermin . You can 't ever leave well enough alone , can you ? You just have to impose your own sense of morality on everyone else . Okay . Okay , let 's cut a deal . All right ? Now , we have to leave here in a couple of days . I still have the timer . If you set us free , we 'll get you off this world . What makes you think I want to go anywhere ? You stranded me on this world . Well , I made the most of it . I 'm Mr. K now . My name inspires terror from here to Saint Louis . You sure it 's not your face ? It helps . I 'm free to go where I want , take what I want . This world 's mine for the picking . It 's a good life for a Kromagg and I don 't need you around to spoil it . Sorry it had to end this way , human . But this town ain 't big enough for the both of us . I love saying that . At least let me drive you . Maggie ! Colin . Thank god . Easy . Oh , I 'm sorry . Kolitar 's here . I know . Where 's Quinn and Remmy ? Kolitar wants us out of the way . He framed Quinn for murder . In a few hours , your friends are gonna be having a little throat trouble . I need to borrow your gun . It 's gone . Oh , my God . Ellie . Hello ? You better get yourself out of here before you get yourself in a real mess of trouble . Are you Quinn ? Yeah . Who are you ? My name 's Ellie Starr . I 'm a friend of Colin 's . He 's okay ? Yeah . He wanted me to give you this . Get out of here ! Little girls shouldn 't play with guns . You killed my father . Yes , I did . You going to shoot me now ? Is that what your daddy would want ? Is that what your friend , Colin , would want ? For you to be a killer , just like me ? Come on ! Make your daddy proud . Come with me . You wouldn 't want to miss the party . Ellie ! Ellie ! Ellie ! Pitiful . Can 't even turn out a decent crowd for a hanging . Hopefully business will pick up once you put the slot machines in . Any last words ? This sucks . Yeah . I never thought it 'd end like this , Remmy . Can 't think of anyone else I 'd rather hang with . Same here . May God have mercy on your souls . Ma ! We 're too late . Stop ! Give me the gun . Shoot them down ! Does anyone have a Ricola ? You okay ? What do you think ? We were just hanged . It 's good to see you , bro . You , too . Nice shooting , farm boy . Thanks . But I 'll be happy if I never have to use one of those again . You just can 't get good help these days . You know , you fellas are violating the lawful order of the court . I 'm just gonna have to cite you for contempt . Oh , you don 't want to do this , songbird . You 're already in enough trouble . I 'm in big trouble ? What 's going to happen when the folks of this town find out that you hired a gunfighter to run them off their land ? Oh , and by the way , you owe me for two shows and a matinee . Sliders ! Ellie ! You people make me ornerier than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest ! Sorry , it 's catching around here . Let her go . I had a good thing going here . Nice steady income , travel . I 'm my own boss . You had a million other worlds where you could go to . Why couldn 't you just leave this one to me ? We didn 't come here on purpose . But now that we 're here , we just can 't walk away . We can 't just leave . I was afraid you might feel that way . So , I guess I 'll just have to hit the trail , find another world to put down roots on . And since I don 't need you dogging me every step of the way , I 'm going to have to ask you for your sliding device . I 'm afraid I must insist . Ma ! Give it to him . You got anything else under there ? Bring it here ! Now , let her go . Why not ? You pulled a gun on me once . No other human has done that and lived . I 'm not armed . Well , that doesn 't usually concern me . Okay . Let 's make this sporting . Pick it up . Let 's see if you 're more willing to use it than her father was . Colin , no ! Pick it up . Stand back . I guess this 'll be the last time we meet . " Adios . " Yahoo ! Family heirloom . It might be worth something someday . Thank you . Nothing like a shot of whiskey to cure a sore throat . So how does it feel to be a free man ? Better than a poke in the eye with a hot branding iron . I 'm sure a lot more of Judge Redfield 's convictions are gonna be overturned now that the Kromagg mind manipulation defense has been upheld . It helps to know the new judge . Your honor . I thought you were going to Reno . Oh , no need . Turns out Redfield and Mr. K went to all that trouble trying to drive off the homesteaders for nothing . They 're perfectly happy to sell out , for a chunk of the casino and showroom profits . Well , here 's to good old American greed . Ladies and gentlemen , direct from Saint Louis , New York ... If you gentlemen will excuse me . ... performances for the crowned heads of Europe , please welcome the songbird of the sage , the warbler of the west . Miss Maggie Beckett ! How hard is she going to be to live with after this ? I don 't even want to think about it . I want to see you sweat I want to see you grind I want to make you mine I 'm losing my mind Walk across the floor in those tight pants Will you bust a seam when you do that dance , baby ? Tight pants !

 [ SNORES ] [ ALARM RINGS ] Hey ! If you 're going to live in the office , at least be on time for work . I 'm sorry . I was up really late poking through people 's desks . All right , I will now outline today 's 1 2-point agenda . We 'll begin with point one , then race forward- - Concerning our pest problem ... ... somebody 's leaving food around , attracting owls . And I , for one , am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps . Now ... ... as this shocking graph shows , our water consumption tripled last month . I noticed Fry 's been here a month ... ... so I 'll appoint him to find who 's responsible . Fry ? [ HUMS ] Am I cracking up , or is Fry 's living here getting in the way of bus- - ? You 're getting a huge dose of radiation . And great lift . Know how long it 'll take to recalibrate these ? When you look this good , you don 't have to know anything . We need to talk about Fry . That 's right ! We want money ! What 's this about Fry ? He 's nice , but it 's time he got his own place . Fuff ! He 's not causing trouble . Now if you don 't mind , I 'm rather busy . I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy . This sarcophagus should contain Emperor Nimballa ... ... who ruled Zubin Five over 29 million years ago . Hey , professor , great jerky . My God , this is an outrage ! I was going to eat that mummy ! Fry has got to go ! NARRATOR : Bachelor Chow , now with flavor . ANNOUNCER : And Bigfoot is down ! Sheesh , 40,000 channels and only 1 50 of them have anything good on . ANNOUNCER : All My Circuits brought to you by Robo Fresh , designed by a robot , for a robot . I 've been processing this for some time , Monique . Will you marry me ? Oh , Calculon ! It fits ! - You must know I 'm- - - Metric ? I 've always known , but for you , my darling , I 'm willing to convert . Must be a friend of theirs . We 've got to discuss your living arrangements . - We 've all talked it over- - - All My Circuits ! Move over . Sometimes in close quarters , people do inconsiderate things not realizing it . - I know , but I forgive you . - No ... ... by " close quarters , " I mean this office . - By " people , " I mean you . - Right . - And by " inconsiderate " - - - We 're trying to watch TV ! Yeah , would you kindly shut your noise hole ? - Who 's the weird-looking guy ? - He 's a human . - What 's he do ? - Usually human stuff . - He laughs , he learns , he loves . - Boring . Calculon , I thought you were in a coma . I wanted you to think that with your soft , human brain . FRY : Hey , why 's the TV getting smaller ? We 'll bill you for the couch . Cheer up , meat bag . You barely touched your amoeba . I just don 't feel like eating . You want it ? Nah , I 'm watching my input . I need lots of wholesome , nutritious alcohol . The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged . - What are the cigars for ? - They make me look cool . I can 't believe they threw me out . I must have been a jerk . Yeah , but everybody 's a jerk . You , me , this jerk . That 's my philosophy . So where are you gonna stay ? I don 't know . Do refrigerators still come in boxes ? But the rent 's outrageous . Why don 't you move in with me ? Really ? That would be great ! You sure I won 't be imposing ? Nah , I 've always wanted a pet . - Here we are , your new home ! - Cool . I 've never seen a robot 's apartment . Come on in . I 'll give you the tour . Let 's see . Where to start ? Okay , this is the TV area . That 's the breakfast nook . Here 's where you 'll live ... ... which is great because it 's been wasted space . It 's cramped . I don 't even have room to hang my clothes . You 've got one set of clothes ... ... and you 're not taking them off while I 'm here . - Well , I 'm bushed . Good night . - Wait , Bender . Bender ? [ BENDER SNORES ] Kill all humans , kill all humans . Must kill all hu- - Bender , wake up ! I was having the most wonderful dream . I think you were in it . Listen , Bender , where 's your bathroom ? - Bath what ? - Bathroom . - What room ? - Bathroom ! - What , what ? - Never mind . Hey , sexy mama . Want to kill all humans ? [ WHISTLES ] We 're cheerful this morning . This week with Fry 's been a blast . Beneath the warm , sunny exterior beats the cold , mechanical heart of a robot . - What happened ? - It 's Bender 's apartment . He put in carpeting . Now , my head hits the ceiling . Do you realize you 're standing at a weird angle ? - Now you 're okay . - Look at you . You 're a wreck . You have to find a new place . Is that an invitation ? Love your optimism . Seriously , you must tell Bender you 're moving out . He might get upset . I can 't do that to him . Hey , there 's my little space heater . [ LAUGHING ] - Well , I 'm moving out . - What ? I 'm sorry , but there 's not enough room . Not enough room ? My place is two cubic meters and we only take up 1 .5 . We have room for another two-thirds of a person ! What if I help you two find a bigger place ? I don 't know . I 've got a lot of great memories in my old place . And now they 're gone . Sure , it ain 't one of them la-di-da aboveground places ... ... but if you like dank , hey , forget about it ! At least it 's got a great view . What the- - ? Excuse me . I gotta go change a light bulb . Wow ! Now , this is fantastic ! I 'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we won 't use . I give up . What 's the catch ? No catch , although we are technically in New Jersey . Not one place even remotely livable . Oh , how awful . Did he at least die painlessly ? To shreds , you say ? Well , how is his wife holding up ? To shreds , you say ? Very well , then . Sad , sad , terrible , gruesome news about my colleague , Dr. Mobootu . Was his apartment rent-controlled ? Wow ! This is beautiful ! BENDER : What 's with the crap ? - It 's not crap . Dr. Mobootu collected this crap while he explored the universe . This place has everything but the thing I care about , a TV . It 's got a TV , you young what-you-call-it . Idiot . Slow down ! This place just doesn 't feel like home . It just isn 't cozy . I can barely move . It 's perfect ! Man , it 's a total sty ! For the first time in years , I feel like I 'm home . It 's gonna be fun on the bun . You know , Fry , of all the friends I 've had , you 're the first . [ DOORBELL RINGS ] - Hey , mon . - Blub-blub . Happy housewarming , Fry . It 's a miniature fruit-salad tree . - Hey , Amy . - Hey . This is for you , Fry . Zevulon the Great . He 's teriyaki-style . Wow , heavy-drinking crowd . I 'd better get more beer . All My Circuits is starting . But I need alcohol to power up my batteries . If Calculon 's wedding doesn 't go just right ... ... I 'll be emotionally and electrically drained . Ey . These are mighty tasty . Thank you . I made them myself . The wedding 's about to start . If anyone here objects to this union , let them speak now or forever hold- - [ BEEPING ] - Is he objecting or backing up ? - Both . My half brother is correct . I have a terrible secret . And that secret is- - - Oh , come on ! - Fix it ! What happened to the TV ? - It went out . - This is an outrage ! I 'm gonna go yell at the manager ! All right ! Come back , Bender ! It 's working . To reiterate , my terrible secret is- - - It 's out again . - What ? That 's the last straw . It 's back on ! I don 't mean to pry into what you 're doing ... ... with the one-eyed lady and Chinese girl ... ... but everyone 's having trouble with their reception . Get rid of what 's causing it or we 're out of this dump ! Relax , sonny . This cajigger will find the source of the interference . [ BEEPS MODERATELY ] [ BEEPS QUICKLY ] [ BEEPS SLOWLY ] [ BEEPS MODERATELY ] - Hey , come on ! - We want our TV back ! [ BEEPS QUICKLY ] There 's the problem . My God , Bender , it 's your thingy ! Then get rid of it ! You people are nuts ! My antenna never interfered with my old TV . You had cable . This is satellite . Your thoughts are transmitted on the same frequency . - They 're on my cell phone too . - Madam , I believe you 're mistaken . BENDER : Wow , that lady 's got a huge ass ! Those could be anyone 's thoughts , fat ass . - The robot has to go ! - Yeah ! - Well , you heard the mob . - Fine ! Let 's move to that apartment that smelled . You liked that one . It 's tempting , but I am already kind of settled in here . We can live underground with mutants . Some fire 'll show them who 's boss . Is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going ? I don 't understand . You live in the closet . You 'll be as happy in your old place . But we wouldn 't be roommates . I 'll come visit . And you can visit me here . - No , he can 't ! - Anyway , it 'll work out . This way , we 'll both be happy . Happy . Yeah , that 's Bender . Always happy . Hey ! The TV 's back on ! VOICE ON TV : We are gathered to mourn Calculon ' s death industrialist , private eye , friend . CALCULON : Mind if I give the eulogy ? WOMAN 'S VOICE : Calculon , you 're alive ! [ CHEERING ] BLOND-HAIRED NEIGHBOR : Calculon 's back ! FARNSWORTH : Right . So long . Goodbye . Will Calculon 's evil twin ever walk again ? I don 't know , Amy . I just don 't know . Hey , thanks for coming . How could you let that mob kick Bender out ? Come on . Bender loves mobs . When he 's in them . You really hurt his feelings . Don 't girl me with that girl stuff . We 're guys . Guys don 't have feelings . - Bender 's not a guy ; he 's a robot . - Same thing . It 's so big and empty . My roommate 's gone . All he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes . What 's the point ? Bender ? My God , you 're a mess ! - Leave me alone . - Look at that five o 'clock rust . You 've been up not drinking . Hey , what I don 't do is none of your business ! Please have a malt liquor , if not for you , for those who love you . I hate the people who love me , and they hate me . It 's obvious you miss being Fry 's roommate . There 's a better way to deal with it . Like how ? Having my antenna removed ? Well , if that would work . You crazy ? That 's Little Bender you 're talking about ! I can 't cut it ! You 're not a robot or a man , so you wouldn 't understand . I gotta get out of here . Wait , look at me and promise you won 't get behind the wheel ... ... without an alcoholic beverage in your hand . I promise nothing ! [ MUMBLES ] Oh ! What up ? I can 't be silent about Bender anymore . Silent ? You 've been meddling for two weeks . I can 't just do that . Your best friend 's out there destroying himself . I didn 't think he 'd miss this apartment that much . He doesn 't . He cares about you . And you turned your back on him . Oh , man , I had no idea . If only I knew where he was , I 'd go talk to him . Oh , stupid TV ! You 're blind , stinking sober ! Right ! I 'm sober and crazy and I don 't know what I might do ! - Don 't do it ! - I don 't know what it is ! Oh , yeah , now I remember . I thought I could live alone , but I can 't . So , I 'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again . - Stop ! - Cutting her head off won 't help ! No , I 'm gonna chop off my antenna . Hey , yeah , that sounds good . Can I give you a hand ? Don 't help him mutilate himself ! It 's a useless antenna . He 's not a ham radio . I 'm gonna do it , I 'm really gonna do it ! Don 't try and stop me ! Here goes ! Oh . Hey , it worked ! The static 's gone ! - I hate that this came between us . - Me too . I 'm filled with a large number ofpowerful emotions . You 're my best friend . Sorry I treated you badly . Apology accepted . After all , you 're only human . You guys could learn from them . - She 's right . - You 're my best friend , Fry . - I 'm sorry I treated you so badly . - Apology accepted . After all , you 're only human . Wait a minute . You did it all backwards . Fry 's the one who should be- - Oh , never mind . Oh . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . I 'm just gonna have to get used to being half a robot . This isn 't right . If we found your antenna , could they reattach it ? Maybe , if we get it on ice right away . Bingo ! You call that an antenna ? This time , you 'll have the human comforts . We 'll get a couple of toilets , food cookers , maybe a puppy . - It 's good to be home . - It sure is . I saved your stuff . So that 's where those skin flakes went . - Will this tree get enough light ? - The closet has a window . This is huge ! Bender , why don 't I just live in here ? In a closet ? Oh , humans .

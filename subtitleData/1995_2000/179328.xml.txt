 Take cover ! Take cover ! - [ Shouting , Indistinct ] - [ Gunfire ] [ McQueen ] Move . ! Now . ! - Bravo One , this is Alpha Two under heavy fire . - [ Gunfire Continues ] - Casualties . Request extraction . - No ! [ Man On Radio ] Alpha Two , your rendezvous is 25 north by 16 east . - We 're a hundred klicks away from the A.R.D. With no cover . - Aw , we 're gonna get Spammed ! We got cover . There 's our ride out . So we 're gonna be Spam in a can . Let 's move ! Move ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Let 's go . ! Come on . Let 's go . ! Let 's go . ! Move . ! - Move ! - [ Grunts ] Shane ! - [ Nathan ] She 's bleeding . - [ Paul ] I got her . I got her . - Let 's get some help over here . ! - [ Yelling , Indistinct ] [ Ricochets Off Metal ] - [ Nathan ] She 's bleeding . - I got her . - Hang tight . - [ Instruments Buzzing ] - Ah , come on . Come on ! - [ Knocking ] - [ Man ] Hey , open the freakin 'hatch . ! You guys have gotta be kiddin ' . Does it look like there 's an " open house " sign out front ? Man , my butt ain 't never gonna un-pucker . Excuse me . - [ Electric Motor Whirring ] - Louie Fox , Sergeant First Class , Seventh Cavalry . From Custer 's Last Stand to here . If there 's a massacre , we 're in it . Outta my way , doll-face . Let 's go . Come on , baby . You know it 's your Louie , right ? - Do it for daddy , sweetheart . - [ Snapping Switches ] Who loves ya , baby ? Your Louie . Come on , sweetheart . - Okay , here 's the big one . - [ Engine Switches On ] - Attagirl . ! - [ Cooper Whoops ] Hey , diddle , diddle . Straight up the middle . Yee-hah ! # # [ Scatting March ] # # [ Continues Scatting ] [ Man ] We thought we were alone . We believed the universe was ours . Until one night in 2063 , on an Earth colony 16 light-years away ... they struck . And now we are at war . My name is Lieutenant Colonel T.C. McQueen . I 'm an InVitro , a race of artificially gestated humans . I command a Marine Corps squadron - the 58th . They call us the Wild Cards . We fight when called - in space , on land and at sea . To lose this war means more than defeat . To surrender is to never go home . All of us must rise to the call above and beyond . [ Engine Running ] - She needs medical attention . - We 'll pull off at the next exit . Look , Sergeant , my people are important to me . So can the wisecracks and drive this APC . You might think I 'm some sort of army dogface , but Pearly is my tank ... and when you 're in my tank , I spout whatever the hell I please , capisce ? This is our alternate rendezvous designation . - Two days , easy , maybe more with the Chigs on our tail . - That 's cuttin 'it close . Extraction 's in two days . We need to radio for another location . Hey , Pearly took some bad hits back there , all right ? Radio 's long since gone . It 's draining ' our power cells . I got one to spare - the one I risked my ass for when you bogarted my tank . So we 'll just have to get there . Sorry , Colonel . I , uh - I tend to get a little testy without my morning coffee . You understand . Mmm . Oh , yeah . Good stuff , sir . Good stuff . Uh , hold on to your Skivvies ! Ah ! Damn Chigs . They got the whole planet booby-trapped . But me and Pearly here , we got this simpatico thing goin ' , huh ? Yeah . You know what your Louie likes . Don 't you , sweet thing , huh ? Come on . Give us a little sugar . Give us a little sugar , baby . Come on . Mwah ! [ Engine Stops ] Looks like you and your APC are out of simpatico . - Tank ! - No need to get ugly , Sergeant . Pearly is not an armored personnel carrier . She 's a tank . You call her an APC one more time , I 'll use your guts to grease her treads ! Sir , Vansen 's wound 's reopened . - She 's got a fever . I think the infection 's spreading . - Here . - You had ampicillin all along ? - Didn 't think she 'd make it . Didn 't wanna waste ' em . The only thing we can 't afford to waste is any time gettin ' to the rendezvous point . - Well , let 's get motivated , ladies . - Keep an eye on her . [ Straining ] Damn tank ditches . Stinkin ' Chigs got ' em everywhere . Jiminy H. Christmas on a Popsicle stick . Give me a small break . [ Louie ] Oh , man . You 've gotta be kidding me . A broken tread ? I know all 's fair in love and war , but this is ridiculous ! Here . You jarheads take this . You take these cables . You attach ' em to the back . - I 'm gonna fix the treads , all right ? Let 's move it . - All right . Baby , what 'd they do to you ? [ Sucks In Air ] - Still bein ' followed ? - You saw ' em , huh ? Yep . I dunno who it is , but they 've been tracking ' us since we turned tail and ran . - Good show . - [ Snapping Weapons ] - Went rather well , wouldn 't you say ? - Identify yourself . Major Cyril Mackendrick of His Majesty 's Coldstream Guards . - Colonel ! - Yanks , eh ? Do you have any gin ? Ah . Many apologies . This trap was meant for the Chigs . You see , I constructed that anticline to resemble an enemy land mine ... the thought being , they 'd avoid it , and right into this trap they 'd go . [ Laughing ] However , you did . [ Chuckles ] Are there others with you ? We 're tryin ' to reach a rendezvous point . We could use some help . My entire battalion was killed at the Battle of Mandrake Ridge . That was eight months ago . You 've been here alone all this time ? Yes . Quite alone . We have an injured marine . She needs medical attention now . You have supplies ? You have women traveling with you ? If you help us , we 'll return the favor and take you with us . - You have a problem with that ? - I won 't be long . Major ! - How do I know you 'll come back ? - You have my word . Your word means nothing to me till I see it backed up by actions . Very well . Can the girl be moved ? My bunker 's just over there . Right . Follow me . I 'm stayin ' here and fixin ' my honey . [ Nathan ] Earth forces have been here 10 months . Could 've left anytime he wanted to . You 're not thinking he could be workin ' with the enemy ? Keep an eye on him . Watch for any ... odd behavior . Mmm . Oh , this is scrummy . Can 't remember last time I ate something other than a berry or a leaf . Mm . Mm . I rather like this gelatinous substance over the layer of chunked beef . [ Chuckles ] " M.R.E. " What does that stand for ? - " Meals rejected by the enemy . " - [ Laughs ] Vanessa should join us . - She 's on watch . - Oh . Remember , only half a cup of water each . I know the lovely captain is ill , still , we must conserve . I thought I 'd die of thirst in the first few weeks . Luckily , I came across an abandoned Earth Forces camp and found a URN-41 . Urine purification system - that 's how I get this water . - And you haven 't seen anyone for eight months . - No , sir . You have a radio . Couldn 't you have signaled for help ? It cannot transmit . I can only receive transmissions . - Troop movements , Earth Forces positions . - Right . - Any trouble keeping busy ? - Of course . However , I make it a point to stick to a strict schedule : Make three cups of water a day ... brush my teeth twice a day and a daily constitutional two on a good day . - [ Louie ] Yee-haw . ! If you stop taking pride in your personal appearance and hygiene , you might as well be dead . Viva la Pearly . We fixed her treads ... we laid down some traction , and old Pearly just hopped right on out . Right . Then you 'd best be on your way . I 'll mark a path on your map . It 'll take you through an area light in enemy activity . Perhaps the major should go with us . - Gather your gear , Major . - No , I-I don 't care to leave . You can 't just choose to stay here , Major . That 's desertion . You insult me , Colonel . - I have not nor would I ever desert - - [ Static On Radio ] [ Clicking ] - Chig attack jets . - I don 't hear nothin ' . They 've locked on a target . They must have spotted the tank . Get inside . Damphousse , get inside ! Take cover . Everybody take cover . Do as I say ! I ain 't taking ' cover . They 're after my baby ! Sergeant , get back here ! Here I come , baby . - Get back here , Sergeant . - Daddy 's comin ' . Come on , you mother-lovin 'Chigs . Take some of this . ! You want some Louie ? You want some Louie ? [ Growling ] [ Screaming ] [ Projectiles Ricocheting ] None of us heard the enemy planes . How did you know they were coming ? They told me . [ McQueen , Mackendrick Panting ] What , like that ? Let me check the manual . [ Shovels Spreading Dirt ] - You think this thing 's gonna make it on one spare power cell ? - Sure . The hell is this ? If the Chigs come across the grave , they 'll dig it up and mutilate the body . Do you realize they had no concept of a life after death ... until they heard it from us ? My theory is , they believe half of us are living dead - an army of zombies . Did they tell you that as well ? The theories of burial are derived from study and observation of their behavior . Knowing they were going to attack the tank is derived solely ... from hearing their communications over the radio for an extended period . You see , the Chigs emit whistles and clicks at various frequencies ... similar to cetacea - dolphins and such . I 've heard them long enough to discern various echolocation patterns of Chigese ... and associate them with subsequent events , such as the strafing . You believe I 've been out here too long . [ Exhales ] What I believe is , we have to get moving , or we 're not gonna reach our rendezvous point . And yes , you are going with us . Let 's do this and move out . Almighty God , through thy infinite love and mercy ... graciously grant to the soul of this , thy dear departed servant , that he should achieve - [ Nathan ] Sir . Excuse me . Um , since we 're pressed for time , I was - I - I figured Sergeant Fox might 've preferred this . I found it in his APC manual . [ Clears Throat ] " Pearly ... " what can I write that hasn 't been said ? " I never understood those techno-obsessed geeks ... " who cared more about their computers than a human being ... " but on this day , when my crew , my friends - " four lives were lost , you saved mine . " It gets me mad that there 's no way to repay you for this ... " except to change your power cells when you 're low ... " and keep you supplied with frags when you 're out ... " and grease your treads when you feel like you can 't go on . " I 've never been able to trust anyone , believe in something , as much as you . I know you 're only a tank and all , but I feel like you believe in me . " I think we 've been followed since our retreat from the battle back there . We can 't waste time by stopping . Up ahead we have to go around that land formation . I want you to fall quietly back , gather what information you can ... cut across that hill and meet us on the other side . [ Together ] Yes , sir . [ Exhales ] May I see your hall pass ? - Get off me ! - Say the magic word . I 'll give you a hint . It 's " master . " Say it : " Please , Master Elroy , may I get up ? " - Say it . - Go to hell . Can 't you just kill anyone without all the theater ? No , no , no , no , no . My sweet Feliciti , please . We need him to get the part to make you well . [ Strained ] You 're never getting anything from me again . [ Beeping ] " Again ? " [ Beeps ] I killed non-combatants . I dropped bombs on civilian populations . I destroyed the innocent . Are you guilty of war crimes ? - Yes . - Hm . And how does what you 've done make you feel , Lieutenant ? I feel shame . Ah-h-h-h . Well , well , well , my darling . Another Elroy-EL model ... has already broken this carbonite at the Kazbek penal facility . Yes . Confessed to war crimes , did we ? Oh - [ Clicking Tongue ] Your friends will think that 's a very bad thing . Get him up . Hands on your head . - [ Electronic Gurgling ] - Feliciti . - Feliciti , my sweet . - [ Gurgling ] - Are you all right , my love ? - Shut up . [ Distorted Voice ] Just get the battery . - [ Gurgling Continues ] - May I confide in you , Lieutenant ? Yes ? Feliciti O.H. And myself were separated from our silicate patrol . She has been wounded by stray weapons fire ... and her power is fading . I , too , am sick . Now , perhaps it is a silicate virus , perhaps it is just spring ... - but I have developed certain ... feelings - - [ Gurgling ] For the Feliciti OH unit that I am not programmed to understand . Thus , I am willing to take a chance , if you are . Yes . One power unit from the APC ... could restore her to 87.4 % capacity . If you bring back one cell ... I promise that I will erase internally ... the memory bank of your confession . Your mistake , Wang Paul , will never have taken place . If you don 't , then I promise ... that I will play the disk loud and clear for your fellow marines ... your family and all your friends back home . Nothing to report , sir . [ Mackendrick ] So , Vanessa - - Do you mind if I call you " Vanessa " ? - Yeah , that 's fine . It 's an enchanting name , wouldn 't you say ? Va-nes-sa - rolls off the tongue like nectar . - [ Engine Winds Down , Stops ] - Did you know " Vanessa " means " butterfly " in Greek ? Oh ? Really ? - [ Snapping Switches ] - Power cell 's dead . Pop in the last one . Got it . It 's gone . Who moved it ? - You sure , Hawkes ? - Yeah . I put it right here . Well , we 're screwed without it . - It had to be Mackendrick . - Yeah . He never did want to leave . The guy speaks Chigese , for God 's sake . A little too close to the enemy for me . What seems to be the problem ? - You tell us . - What ? [ McQueen ] The tank is missing a spare power cell , Major . [ Laughs ] You all think I stole your blasted power cell ? [ Laughs ] I should strand us out in the middle ofbloody nowhere ... when just as easily I could have done it back at my bunker , where I could give us some shelter ? Why would I steal this power cell anyway ? You could be working with the Chigs . I 'm a human being , for God 's sake . There are no double agents in this blasted war . The 58th has been together too long , Major . We know each other too well . I 've lived through eight months of hell ... only to face a kangaroo court of wet-behind-the-ears grunts ? Not bloody likely ! You want loyalty ? I can trace my family 's service in my very regiment ... back to the Coldstream Guards fighting against Cromwell ! - No ! - [ Snapping Weapons ] Major , your weapon . Please . [ Scoffs ] Wang . Major , you 're under arrest by order of the United States Marines . [ Vanessa ] Let 's get this set up early . We need at least two hours ' sunlight to recharge enough juice ... to reach the rendezvous point . Minerva 's sun sets 2335 our time . That 's only 85 minutes . Looks like we got some cloud cover moving ' in . - Can we make it in time on foot , sir ? - No way . We had that power cell , we 'd make it with time to spare . [ Nathan ] Feed the line up . The power port 's on top . I guess all we can do is put our faith in Pearly . Shane , it 's dinner . You gotta eat somethin ' . Oh , Hawkes , minced ham . That 's worse than a shrapnel wound . She 's feelin ' better . She 's startin ' to bitch again . Jolly good . Wonderful how you can demonstrate such care and concern for one human being ... while unjustly turning on another . Bravo . - You know , Sedgwick - - Mackendrick . I 've spent a lot of time alone before . I don 't know what you think is so great about it . Well , to begin with , when alone ... one rarely ties oneself up and holds oneself prisoner . For me , bein ' so alone was like bein ' in a prison . You know ? Yes . Yes , Lieutenant , that 's true . Then why 'd you wanna stay so bad that you 'd take our power cell and leave us stranded ? I didn 't take the blasted cell . Lieutenant Hawkes , the entire time in His Majesty 's service , I was assigned as ... what you young Americans would call a " pencil-pushing geek . " Supply , support . And every year , I would request a transfer to a unit that would taste the sting of battle ... so that I might do my part to serve my country and my planet . And every year they turned me down . Eight months ago , at the Battle of Mandrake Ridge ... the Chigs hit our supply lines ... and I finally felt ... battle 's sting . I saw ... men and women so dear to me ... so mutilated ... they were unrecognizable as human forms ... let alone as people I loved . I 'm sure you know . No , I don 't like being alone , Mr. Hawkes . But it has offered me the chance to study our enemy - learn his tactics and some of his language to a degree I 'm certain no human has achieved . And one day I will return with what I 've learned here , alone ... and that information will help defeat this horrific enemy that massacred my friends . But if I were to return now ... they 'd have me back on inventory of packaged foods and blankets ... while completing Forms 18 , stroke , 79 . And while I realize the vital importance of that role - [ Sighs ] It 's not enough ... for me - for those friends I 've lost ... it 's not enough . But in the meantime , I 'm perfectly happy ... suffering this indignity at the hands of my allies . Minced ham ? Will you untie me so that I may not suffer the further humiliation of being spoon-fed ? Then bug off ! I gotta go to Congress . - Where 's the latrine ? - This whole planet 's a head . - West , you got my copy of Stars and Stripes ? - Yeah . No . That 's mine . Don 't make it last , Wang . I 'm goin ' too . " Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath ... hath had no power yet upon thy beauty . " Looks like you 're not gonna need that power cell . [ Electronic Gurgling ] [ Elroy ] Put your hands on your head . She 's dead , you 're dead . - [ Grunts ] - [ Groans ] [ Feliciti Gurgling ] [ Electronics Humming ] Return , my love . Yes . - [ Beeping ] - [ Quietly ] Yes . Wang . ! Wang . ! - [ Nathan ] What the hell happened ? - See , I just - I just found the power cell . - Where , here ? - Yeah . I was walking , and I heard something ... and I , uh , ran after the noise , and I came up over the hill , rifle ready ... and , uh , man , I just ate it on a branch . - Right here , on the ground ? - Yeah . Whoever took it must have totally freaked out and took off when they heard me comin ' . Least we got it back . Come on . Let 's move out . [ Beeping ] [ Beeps ] [ McQueen ] Let 's move it . We 've only got 30 minutes of daylight left . Hey ! You found it ? - Hey , Paul found the power cell ! - [ Hawkes ] Wang ! - [ McQueen ] So , where 'd you find this ? - It 's a long story . L - I was goin ' to the head . I heard this noise , and it was just sittin ' there in the clearing . Now we can get outta here , right ? Wrong . This cell is empty . West , what are you doin ' ? [ Hawkes ] West . ! Major didn 't take the power cell . Tell ' em who did , Paul . [ Quietly ] I did it . [ Beeping Quietly ] One time , I was in a car accident . It was my fault . The light turned from yellow to red , and I gunned it . And a guy in a truck was making a left ... and I ran into him . And I 'll always remember how fast your mind works . In a second - in less than a second - I thought ... " I should 've hit the brakes . " I even remember thinking ... " I wish I could have that second back , so I could stop . " And that 's when I hit the other car . Imagine that moment - that feeling - gnawing at you every ... minute of your life ... only the consequences of your actions were much more life affecting - like some kids who didn 't take a second to use a rubber and a teenager ends up pregnant ... or ... somebody doesn 't take a moment to lock the gun cabinet , and a child dies . A marine ... who didn 't stop to think he was betraying the Corps - [ Sniffles ] His country - Wang , those A.I. ' s tortured you , man . What else could you do ? I could 've let ' em kill me ! Paul , no one ever believes those confessions . Everyone knows that you 're not a war criminal . That 's not the point of them ! The point is to show that they can break your spirit . Why couldn 't my body have broken down before my soul ? They may as well have cut off a hand or a leg ... because they took something from me I can never get back . It so obsessed me - so possessed me - that when the chance arose to erase it without anyone knowing , I took it . I swear , I never - [ Sniffles ] Never intended to give them the cell . I just wanted the optical disk with the confession . I thought I could get back what they took . I needed it back ... even if I was risking your lives - [ Sniffles ] Lives that mean more to me than - [ Voice Breaking ] Than my own . - [ Paul Sobbing Quietly ] - We have no choice but to see how far the ... partially-recharged fuel cell will take us by morning . Paul , I know how alone you feel . You have people in your life now ... who can help you get back what you lost . Major , I 'd like to apologize for not coming forward when you were accused . I 'm the one who can 't be trusted . Apology accepted , Lieutenant . Shall we move on to the rendezvous point ? [ Buttons Clicking ] All right . Here goes . [ Engine Switches On ] - [ Cheer ] - [ Engine Stops ] Come on , Pearly . Who loves ya , huh ? You know it 's me , baby . - [ Engine Switches On ] - Yes ! All right , all right . - That weirds me out on so many different levels . - [ Mackendrick ] Be prepared . This area coming up 's heavy with Chig activity . - [ Engine Wavering ] - Oh , I think the power cell 's fading . - [ Wavering Continues ] - Come on , baby . Come on , Pearly . Sunrise is only 30 minutes away . - [ Low Humming ] - Hey ! Hey ! Did you hear that ? - I hear it . - [ Humming Continues ] That 's a Chig T-77 tank . If we had a radio , I could figure out if they were heading towards us . - We turn the main power off , maybe they won 't spot us . - We probably don 't have ... enough power left to engage them anyway . - [ Engine Switches Off ] - [ Humming Continues ] Well , we just can 't sit here blind . Let 's open up her eyes . [ Vanessa ] Ah , no way . He 's movin 'at us like he knows exactly where we are . [ Beeps ] [ Beeps ] That 's how they were homing in . [ Vanessa ] Five hundred meters to range solution . Do it . Tank stops , we run our ass off to the rendezvous point . Let 's move ! - I need someone on the battlesight range input . - I 'm on it . - I 'm on the scope . - I need a gunner topside on the twin . 50s . - I 'll do it . Do you mind ? - Who 's the loader ? - No loader . It 's automatic . - [ Shane ] Chig 75 meters at noon . - [ Female Electronic Voice ] Target acquired . - Tallyho ! Tallyho , you monsters ! [ Ricochets Off Metal ] - [ Electronic Voice ] Neato . - Hold on , guys . This beer 's on you , Chiggie boy . - Direct hit . - [ Others Cheering ] But still coming . [ Gunfire ] Tallyho , ya monstrous creatures ! You crustaceans ! Chig T-77 has a high-density ceramic front end . We 'll need a side hit with a sabot . - I got the wheels . You just tell me where to go . - Sixty-five degrees port , hard ! [ Yells , Indistinct ] - [ Engine Wavers ] - [ Vanessa ] We 're losing power . - [ Mackendrick ] Tallyho . ! - There 's no way we can outmaneuver ' em . - [ Yells ] Bloody monsters . ! - Just keep movin ' . You 'll get the side shot . - Paul ! - Trust me . Ten degrees north , closing ! - He 's locked on us ! - I can 't shake ' em ! [ Elroy ] Wang Paul ... you have done a very bad thing . You took the battery ... and now my sweet Feliciti belongs to the ages - - [ Cocks Pistol ] - And so will you . [ Machine Gunfire ] [ Mackendrick ] Splendid marksmanship , Lieutenant . I 'm not so bad either , I 'm delighted to say . [ Beeping , Static Pop ] Here 's the optical hard drive . It 'll have your confession on it . I hope that 'll get your moment back for you , Paul . - [ Engine Wavering ] - Come on . This should be the place . Hawkes , check it out . You got it . Hey ! Hey , guys , we got ' em ! Whoo ! - [ Laughing , Cheering ] - Move out ! Guys , right here ! [ Whoops ] Oh , come on . ! [ Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Whooping ] - Well , I knew she could make it . - There 's even a little extra juice to spare . Let 's go ! [ Whooping ] - Hey ! - Come on ! Hey ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! We got a Chig squadron 300 klicks out . Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! - They 're in . Wheels up . - Where 's Mackendrick ? God save the king ! Ah , let him go . A couple of more months , he 'll be our best weapon . [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

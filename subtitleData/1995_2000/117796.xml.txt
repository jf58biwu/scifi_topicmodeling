 In the late 20th century , hostile forces inside the United States grow strong . The city of Los angeles is ravaged by crime and immorality . To protect and defend its citizens , the United States police Force is formed . A presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy LA in divine retribution . Like the mighty fist of God , Armageddon will descend upon the city of Los angeles - the city of sin , the city of Gomorrah and Sodom - and waters will arise and separate this sinful , sinful city from our country . An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the Richter scale hits at 1 2 : 59pm , August 23 in the year 2000 . After the devastation , the Constitution is amended , and the newIy-eIected president accepts a lifetime term of office . The country 's capital is relocated from Washington , DC , to the President 's home town of Lynchburg , Virginia . Los angeles island is declared no Ionger part of the United States , and becomes the deportation point for all people found unfit to live in a new , moral America . The United States police Force , Iike an army , is encamped along the shoreline , making any escape from LA impossible . From the south-east of Orange country to the north-west of malibu , the Great wall excludes LA from the mainland . The President 's first act as commander in chief is Directive 1 7 - Once an American loses his or her citizenship , they are deported to this island of the damned and may never come back . Attention . We are on tactical alert . Remain at battle stations . I repeat , remain at battle stations . This is the police channel , and this is Prime News . In a Iate-breaking story , the Force has announced the arrival of the most notorious outlaw in US history at Firebase Seven , the deportation centre for Los angeles island . Now this on-the-scene report . War hero . criminal . The Force 's most wanted man . Convicted of 27 moral crimes . Arrested two weeks ago on a charge of gunfighting for profit in New Vegas , thailand , US territory . It 's been 16 years since his famous rescue in New York , and the reports of PIissken sightings ... Commander ? I 'm still getting a trace from the rescue team , sir . - Stationary signal ? - Has not moved from this location . That means he 's hiding , captured , or dead . So we go with PIissken ? He 's all we 've got . hello , PIissken . welcome to LA . Come on . Move it . - That 's Snake PIissken ? - What did you expect ? He just looks so retro . Kind of 20th century . Good old days . Let 's get going . You are now entering the deportation centre . You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the USA and sentenced to permanent expulsion beyond its borders . failure to follow instructions will be met with use of force . Look at ' em , PIissken . Prostitutes , atheists , runaways ... We 're throwing out the trash . " SD Bob PIissken , special Forces . " Two purple Hearts ? Youngest man ever decorated by the President . Rescued a different president in ' 97 . So , what happened to you , war hero ? You were the best . Now you 're just like them . You had it all and you turned away from your country . Why ? The whole nation 's watching . Every good and decent person who works hard and follows the rules . Be my guest . What do you have to say , PIissken ? call me Snake . You are now entering the processing area . The next scheduled departure to LA is in one hour . You now have the option to repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises . If you elect this option , notify the cleric sergeant in your processing area . How 's it going , hotshot ? You know , I got to admit . I thought we had you in cleveland . - How 'd you do it ? - Get to the deal . - What ? - You need me for something . What ? Show him . At 1030 hours , Wednesday , a group of government officials began a tour of the Benford Space Defence lab . The President 's daughter , Utopia , was among them . During the tour , she came into possession of a top-secret prototype . Then she boarded Air Force Three for Lynchburg . To the American people - now is the time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror ! At 1 1 40 hours , she hijacked Air Force Three . We scanned this onto the VR . Check it out . Today is day one of a brand-new world . The days of empire are finished . To the President , my father ... You know what 's in here , and unless you open your borders , allow all the wrongfully accused to return to their country , I will use this on you and on the United States . Her emergency escape pod landed somewhere in LA . Her ELT signal ceased immediately . After that , silence . We sent a five-man rescue team . Within hours of landing all but one was killed . hell of a team . Skip the commentary , PIissken . call me Snake . Get on with it . After her sister committed suicide , Utopia began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator . She 'd punch up her own world and stay in it for days . Somebody else was in there . Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences and tried to erase them , but she missed one image . We found this fragment on the end of her last tape . Cuervo Jones . Peruvian terrorist . Shining Path member . Runs the MescaIito Justice , biggest , baddest gang in LA . Somehow , Cuervo Jones managed to tap into the VR master data bank . Utopia was looking for something to believe in , so he used her to steal the black box . Sad story . You got a smoke ? This is serious , PIissken . The black box is a matter of national security . Looks like it belongs to Utopia 's Iover-boy now . Yeah . We want it back . I 'II bet . What 's it do ? Top secret . only on a need-to-know . evidently , I don 't need to know , so fuck you , I 'm going to hollywood . If you go into LA , bring back the black box , and you will receive a pardon for every immoral act you have committed . Sounds familiar . An immediate answer . Yes or no ? Who are you ? I 'm your president . I understand you got some domestic problems . Put that black box in my hand , and you 're a free man . I can see you 're real concerned about your daughter . Utopia is lost to me . My daughter is gone . - Last chance , hotshot . - For what ? Freedom , sir . In America ? That died a Iong time ago . I 've heard enough of this . explain to this foot soldier why he 's going to do what we tell him to do . What 's he talking about ? The PIutoxin Seven virus . genetically engineered . 100 % pure death . complete nervous system shut-down . You crash . You bleed out like a stuck pig . It 's not a pretty sight . I see . You figure I 'II do whatever you want , just like New York , huh ? - You got it ... Snake . - One question . Which one of you assholes gets to die trying to stick me ? You don 't understand . It 's already in you . Catches on quick , doesn 't he ? Your countdown clock is now activated . Designer viruses , PIissken . Wave of the future . You 've got less than ten hours to live . It 's already moving through your bloodstream . Go on - touch that pad . Of course , there is an antidote , and it neutralises the virus immediately upon injection . Which I will personally authorise once your mission is completed . The man is too dumb to survive LA . We 're holograms , PIissken . Give us a little credit . We 're not that stupid . Get this crap out of me . I guess we 've got a deal . Nice to be working with you , hotshot . You 'd better hope I don 't make it back . AII of you . Core burner , magnesium ammo , 500 extra rounds . oral projectile . Mouth dart , filled with uroIyde . It will stun the enemy . Every member of the rescue team had a tracking chip in his arm . One might still be alive . Use the tracer in your watch to locate him . This holographic camera will project your image up to a haIf-miIe away . 100 % audio capability . It 's a prototype . Confuse and deceive the enemy . Its mini-nuke battery is good for eight minutes , but only works once . Save it for when it counts . plain oId-fashioned matches . Never know when you might need them . Where are my guns ? I thought you might want those . stealth clothing . Fire retardant , nuIIifies heat detection . Put them on . I 'II take the coat . You 'II take ' em all . AII right . LA 's being primed as a beachhead for an invasion of the US . War is being declared , PIissken , or didn 't you know ? Oh , I forgot . You don 't give a shit . Cuervo Jones runs Shining Path . They want North America . The revenge of preindustrial societies . Shining Path has united Third world countries . The Cubans and brazilians will invade Miami . The CoIombians are at the border , we 've got a fuII-scaIe attack . - High stakes . - How am I going in ? Under the San Fernando Sea . Shark Three submarine , one-man submersible . Just like the turbine model , only this one 's nucIear-powered . It 's very simple . throttle up , throttle back . Put ashore at the Cuegan Pass . Go through the mountains toward the hollywood bowl . Locate the survivor of the rescue team . He 's your only source of information . - Do I bring him back ? - Negative . - Figures . - He 's probably already dead . Once you go inside , you 're on your own . Get the black box back to the submarine . It 's your only way out . PIissken ! You know what to do with the girl . We don 't need to waste any more time and money on bullshit trials . kill her . Is that order from the President ? absolutely . Let 's just say it 's best for the country . By the way , who gives me the antidote ? - A medical team . - Neither of you ? - No . - Good . Thought you 'd try that , hotshot . The first clip is loaded with blanks . Bye bye , Snake . Good luck . Nice and easy now . - Com check . - Yeah . I 'm here . Stand by for launch . Eight hours , eight minutes , 26 seconds to neurosystem shut-down . Ignitor . fuel rod injection . She 's in the green . - Lock fuel rods . - Locked . nuclear turbine to 75 % power . 75 % power . Hands on switches and counting . Five ... four ... three ... two ... one . Launch . Watch your speed . There 's lots of obstructions . His reactor 's starting to overheat . slow down , you 're overloading the power plant ! You slow down , dickhead . I 'm dying . PIissken ! Power plant overload . Guidance systems malfunction . You no Ionger have control stick function . Obstruction ahead . PIissken . Yeah . I 'm here . Cuegan Pass . 'What happened to the submarine ? It disappeared off our screens . PIissken ! I gotta go . Too bad about your boat , man , but we 'd appreciate it if you 'd stay off our beach . Just passing through . You look kind of familiar . - What do you want ? - Nothin ' . - I just recognised you , that 's all . - That 's all ? Come on , man . I 'm not looking for trouble . I used to see you a Iot when I surfed , on the police channel . You 're pretty far out , Snake . I mean , cool . But I kind of thought you 'd be ... taIIer . Which way to the hollywood bowl ? Down that way . It 's just an aftershock . We get them all the time . Thanks for not killing me , man . I owe you one . Acid rain . Hey , Snake , what are you doing here anyway ? I heard they busted you pretty good in cleveland . Location of rescue team member - 50 yards from your present position . Location of rescue team member - 40 yards from your present position . Rescue team member is located 10 feet from your present position . 100 bucks says you can 't put three blades into him . Want a throw ? Hey , one-eye , I 'm talking to you . Where can I find Cuervo Jones ? What do I Iook like , a fucking tour guide ? - It 's wintertime , baby . - I 'm looking for Cuervo Jones . Why ? Hershe 's looking for Cuervo too . - Where is he ? - He 's on Sunset . He 's gonna come by . Sunset . boulevard . Ooh-hoo , you really are new , aren 't you ? Come on , baby . I 'II show you . Keep going down that way , honey . You can 't miss it . Hey , one-eye ! Look in my face when I talk to you , shit-heeI . Whoa ! Neurosystem shut-down - seven hours . PIissken . Yeah ? Did you find the team member ? Yeah , they 're using him for target practice . What will you do ? Amigos , no matter where you come from , or what colour you are , we 're all the Russia of the oppressed ! - Watch the parade . - What ? We 've got the north by the balls . Come on ! Right ? Right ? Meet me at the Happy Kingdom . Let 's party tonight , because tomorrow we 're going to start our way back to glory ! Yeah ! We got our freedom ! We got a future ! That looks like Snake PIissken . Who ? Used to be a gunfighter . Faded out from the scene a few years ago . I hear he slowed down some . Doesn 't look that slow , Cuervo . Watch it ! Watch it ! No ! Nobody rolls into town and disrespects me . Not Snake PIissken , not nobody . BoIas ! Take him out ! I 'm gonna give you assholes a chance . What do you say we play a little ... Bangkok rules ? Nobody draws until this hits the ground . You ready ? Draw . Hey , he left his coat here , man . MaIIoy . PIissken . Have you got the black box ? Negative . And I 've lost the core burner and hoIocam . I don 't need to know your problems , I just want my black box . You 've got seven and a half hours . Do you read me ? Listen , MaIIoy . This guy 's got more heat around him than the President . I 'II get your box , but I need time , understand ? Listen , PIissken , that headache that just kicked in will only get worse . You 're starting to feel the effects of the virus . Soon you 'II have a fever . Now , you bear that in mind . Just push on through , soldier . Oh , don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . I thought it was you . Yeah , I recognised you right away . I 've been hangin ' round here for years , but I never thought I 'd see Snake PIissken . It 's a real pleasure to meet you . I 'm Map To The Stars Eddie . Where 's Cuervo Jones ' place ? He 's the man with the President 's daughter . He 's setting up something big , but I got a feeling you know that , right ? Location . That way . If you 're going through beverly hills , you 're gonna need a map . It 's pre-recorded . I narrated it myself . welcome to your own map to the stars . That 's me . The big one wiped out the entertainment industry in LA , but the glamour of hollywood is still alive , so come and see where the stars ... Hey , Snake , you 'II need this . I 'm telling you . I 'II give you a deal . 50,000 bucks . That 's a real bargain ! ... Map To The Stars Eddie , and here we go . Sucker . Stay down , man , or they 'II see you . It 's only their second shift . Don 't make one move . If you want to make noise , go and find another bush . You 're the one making all the noise . Ah , shit ! PIissken 's tracer just went down . Terminated ? Yes . We can 't locate him - he 's wearing stealth . - Now what ? - We sit tight and wait . Wait ? For how long ? He 's probably dead . Wait , Mr President . Be patient . I told you to stay down . Look what you 've done . I can 't believe this . Are you Snake PIissken ? You look like him ... in a way . By the way , genius , we 're both dead meat . What are they ? surgical failures . They live here . Too many implants and face-Iifts over the years . Their muscles turn to JeII-O . They only survive by having fresh body parts transplanted over and over again . Oh , my God . Who 's that ? The surgeon general of beverly hills . These are no good . You couldn 't give them away . And this ... I can do nothing with this one . wheel it away . I can 't work with garbage like this . Now , these two ... They look very good . My God , they 're real . What a beautiful blue eye . Shame he only has one . Nurse ! still ... One eye 's better than none . Anybody moves , I 'II blow his brains out and then yours . You ... get my guns . Now . Back off . Now , everybody relax , and he won 't die . Hey . Hey , man , help me . You 'II never find your way out of here without me . really . Cut her down . Down there . quickly . Get in . I think we lost them . I think we 're lost . This way . I used to run guns with the black Jihad last year . We drove golf carts up and down these tunnels . I know them like the back of my hand . You are Snake PIissken , aren 't you ? I used to be . I thought you 'd be taller . - What are you doing in LA ? - Dying . Ooh . But first you got to find something ? President 's daughter . She 's with Cuervo Jones . You want to go to Cuervo 's place ? - I 've been there once . - Show me . AII right . I always heard about you , like they couldn 't catch you no matter what you did . Very cool , Snake . Sooner or later , they get everybody . Up . Cuervo Jones ' place is down that way . Get off at the Vermont exit . Go south . You can 't miss it . Be careful , though . This is Korean Dragon territory . It 's very dangerous around here . Bye . Snake ? When you find the President 's daughter , are you going to take her back ? No . - You 're staying in LA ? - Not if I can help it . Sun is coming up in a few hours . UV 's gonna be bad today . I know a place where we could crash ... if you want . My boyfriend and I broke up tonight , so ... I 'd love to take care of you ... and make you feel good . I 'II read your future . The future is right now . ... and condemn the innocent blood . Dear God , we call on you to be our defence and our refuge . We give thanks for being alive , and pray that in your mercy ... Snake , it 's me - TasIima . I 'm coming with you to Cuervo 's place . Yeah ? They 're new . They don 't belong to any gang . They 're just scared , that 's all . That 's how I was when they first deported me . - Why are you here ? - I was a muslim in South Dakota . suddenly they made it a crime . I mean , why stay ? You can go south - Mexico . LA 's still the place . What 's happened on the other side of the world ... That 's the prison . This is the only free zone left ... anywhere . Dark paradise . At least we get something . A girl can still wear a fur coat if she wants to , for example . No , no , once you figure out this place , it 's really not so bad . Get down ! Where 's it coming from ? The car in the street below ! Hop in , Snake . Come on . Nobody ever gets out of beverly hills alive . - That 's why you let me go there . - You need one of my maps . Listen to me , Snake . I got connections here . You can 't just walk around without knowing the ropes . Take the wrong street , you 're dead . Stop the car . AII right , anything you say . although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones ' place . - Where is it ? - Right over there . It 's pretty neat , huh ? It 's Cuervo 's car . He lets me use it . Don 't worry , you 've just been shot with a fun gun . feel it ? You feel it ? It 's pure mesh , man . 100-proof artery choker . When the hit pulls you an inch from death , that is living . I 'm actually Cuervo 's agent , I 'd love to represent you too . We could make a bundle . help your career . Last couple of years , it 's like you 've disappeared ... I know what the cops sent him to do . PIissken was the second rescue team , looking for the box and the girl . AII I 'm asking for is a finder 's fee . Maybe Wisconsin . I don 't know . - We 're almost set up , Cuervo . - Good . I originally heard about this when I was working for NASA . Common , ordinary remote-controI unit . Yeah ? Everyone 's got one , right ? Here 's the kicker . This instruction disk hooks you into the Sword of damocles , the ultimate defensive weapon system . You see that ? A ring of satellites encircling the earth . Attached to each satellite is a mega neutron bomb . When detonated , each satellite unleashes an intense electromagnetic pulse , but EMP doesn 't harm a living thing . But it does shut down every known power source , all electrical devices , cars , aeroplanes , toasters , computers , everything ... even batteries . But this ... makes this an aiming device that gives the user incredible accuracy . You can pinpoint precisely what you want to shut down . A taxi cab in Buenos Aires , the entire country of Spain . Amazing . You could shut down the whole planet , send it right back to the Dark Ages . - He 's dead . - I agree . PIissken 's been dead before , but he never stays down . The mission 's scrubbed , Commander . I shouldn 't have let you talk me out of that air strike . well , it 's on now , effective immediately . FuII-scaIe . Target Los angeles . flatten it . Burn it . No ! What did you say ? Cuervo Jones is holding all the cards now , sir . He sees our aircraft , he pushes that button ... kaboom ! There goes our aircraft AND the United States . We don 't even know if he knows how to work the goddam thing . Snake PIissken , American outlaw . You 'II like this . Remember , Cuevo , you 've got to punch in the world code first - 666 . That brings all the satellites on Iine . Eh , pendejo , you think I 'm stupid ? No . No . No . I 'm sorry , Cuervo . Bring them in . OK , OK , go on . 'HeIIo , North America . Buenas noches , Sud America . Yes , I am Cuervo Jones ... Wait a minute . That 's PIissken . This is LA , people without hope or a country . I knew it . He 's alive . You know what they want - liberation . Now it 's their turn . I am taking over with this . I told you not to try to get this back , didn 't I ? But you disobeyed me . well ... He 's entering the target code . Bend over , Mr President . Time for a spanking . He 's targeting Lynchburg . That 'II shut down the capital . Get me the White House . - This broadcast is live ... - Get me my wife , please . - Are you watching TV ? - Yes , I 'm watching it . Yes , I know . Curfew . hello ? hello ? Hey , Presidente , silence is golden , no ? Don 't tell me you didn 't enjoy this just a little bit . I mean , if your wife 's anything like your daughter , she 's sweet , but you just can 't shut her up . Knock it off , Cuervo . AII right , now this is set . We shut down the entire United States . I want a police chopper to come and get me at the Happy Kingdom , no later than 5am . Once I 'm airborne , you 'II get your orders . Remember , don 't piss me off , or I 'II ... pull the plug . I 'm at the mercy of this madman . Don 't count PIissken out , sir . He 's tanked . He 's a POW . But he 's still alive . Six , five , four , three , two , one ! Shot clock ! Get him . Get him up . But this is insane . It is . That 's the point . AII right , all right . I promised you tonight was going to be special . I also promised one last spectacle of death in this historic arena . Now you will see that death . I give you ... the death of Snake PIissken ! Some people think you 're already dead , Snake . Some say you never will be . You may have survived cleveland , you may have escaped from New York , but this is LA , vato . And you 're about to find out that this fucking city can kill anybody ! LA ! LA ! Game time ! basketball . Two hoops . full court . 10-second shot clock . Miss a shot - get shot . Buzzer goes off before you shoot - get shot . Two points for a basket . No three-point bullshit . AII you got to do is make 10 points . That 's it . By the way , nobody 's ever walked off that court alive . Nobody . AII right ! Six , five , four ... three , two , one ! Five , four ... three , two , one ! - Nice shot . - He 's getting tired now . Four , three , two , one ! This town loves a winner . He won , Cuervo . - You can 't kill him . - I have to . Get off ! It 's the big one ! Find him ! We 're going to Anaheim . Come here . Cuervo . Cuervo , wait up . Give me a minute ! - Get lost , agent ! - We got a relationship here , man . Let me make something clear . I 'm getting irritated , and that 's not good . Irritated with me ? Cuervo , I 'm taking care of you , understand ? - We can 't find him , Cuervo . - Keep looking ! Get in the car . If I 'm being too rough on you , just let me know . Snake , don 't shoot . It 's me - Utopia . I 'm alone . This whole place is a nightmare . Cuervo 's a killer . He 's worse than my father . I want to go back with you . Oh , my God . My father sent you to kill me , didn 't he ? Shut up . Get out of here . Go . Wait . You can 't take that back , Snake . Oh , God . You can 't give that to him . He wants to control everything , just like Cuervo . If I don 't take it back , I 'm dead . Another one ? Run ! It 's over . Get me a damage report as soon as possible . Yes , sir . Oh , thank God almighty . Maybe that 's the answer to all of our problems . Maybe ... maybe they 're all dead . Maybe . Oh , Cuervo , man ! We almost bought the farm . The whole place just fell in right behind us . Where is PIissken ? He 's down there . He 's dead . He 's history , and I did it . I killed him . I shot him . Right ? tell him . Give it to me . Oh , yeah . I brought it back to you , Cuervo . It 's all there . Whoa , dude , is that you , Snake ? Far out , man . Hey , did you find Cuervo , man ? Hey , Cuervo , wait . I 've done it all , man . I killed PIissken . I got your girl back for you ... So where is he ? I shot him . He went down , OK ? His body 's probably in WiIshire Canyon somewhere . Good ! So then you know where he is . Bring me his head . - Where 's the Happy Kingdom ? - Anaheim . The invasion staging area . Everyone 's gonna be there , except me . I 'm staying here , man , I 'm ready for the big wave . - Take me there . - What ? Take me there . You 're not well , Snake . You need help . hold on . - Who shot you ? - It doesn 't matter . Yeah , you 're right . talk to Hershe . She hates Cuervo . They used to be partners , and they split up . - Who ? - Hershe . She lives in a big boat . Hangs with Saigon Shadow . Man , they don 't take shit from nobody . What is that ? Tsunami , Snake . Tsunami ! Woo ! Surf 's up big-time now , mister . Ha ha ! Start feeling better quick , man , cos you ain 't got time to escape . This is going to be some ride , man , some kind of bitchin ' ride . Let 's go . Come on . Bitchin ' , man . Let the front edge pick you up . Don 't get on till you ride to the top . Don 't blow it , man . If you faII off , it 's the big wipe-out . Got it ? Whoo ! Bitchin ' . Hang on , Snake . You got to be kidding me . Later . Ooh , Snake ! tell me how to get downtown - somebody named Hershe . - Sure , Snake . No problem . - Hey , hey ! Are you going to kill me ? Hershe . Right . Keep straight . Two blocks down , right . Warning . Neurosystem shut-down . One hour . I first met Hershe when I got deported . She helped set me up . We 're talking a power player . Cuervo 's got numbers and firepower , but Hershe 's got big-time ambitions . The two of you hooked up together , I 'm talking box-office material . What ? Easy , Snake . I see him , too . We 're OK . Come on . She 's going to love you , Snake . You 'II love her , too . We 'II make this thing happen . I 'm through with Cuervo . The guy 's got no sense of loyalty whatsoever . Through here . What ? How you doin ' ? Long time , no see . Remember me ? Map To The Stars Eddie . I got somebody I want Hershe to meet , Snake PIissken , right here in the flesh . Your gun . Great . Thanks , pal . AII right , we 're in . Strange scene here . Let me do the talking . Hey , Hershe , how you doin ' ? Hang on , guys . This is big . It 's Snake PIissken . I brought him to see you , Hershe . He 's got a business proposition . - What 's in it for me ? - Wait a minute . I know that voice . Yeah ... You 're Carjack MaIone . Not any more . You two know each other ? The more things change , the more they stay the same , huh , Carjack ? still packing a gun between your legs . hold on , honey ... You bolted on me in cleveland . Hershe , you were in cleveland ? With me and Texas Mike O 'Shea . You looked different then , Carjack . Get one thing straight . I 'm no Ionger Carjack MaIone . I 'm Hershe Las palmas , the most drop-dead number . What the hell happened in cleveland ? - I got caught and you didn 't ! - Don 't lie to me ! So I made another deal ! I 've been here five years , not you ! I got a new deal . You help me , you live . I wouldn 't do that , Snake . See , anything happens to me , and you 're dead . I 'm already dead . I see your point . What 's the deal ? Get me to Cuervo Jones . I got one hour . Dream on , blue eye . Say good night , Carjack . Cuervo 's got firepower . No one gets near him . And he 's got the black box and the girl . - What black box ? - That shuts down the power . Oh , yeah , right ! And the PIutoxin Seven virus kills you in ten hours . - What ? - It 's bullshit ! Rumour control . Government propaganda . Just one more lie . It 's true . I represented the guy who invented it . Swear to God , Snake . What 's the deal , gorgeous ? Get the girl and the box , and get out . AII of us ? - Yeah . - Me , too ? Why should we leave ? I Iove LA . Where we gonna go ? What 's the big payoff ? A million dollars for whoever helps me . A million greenbacks ? I got ten million the next room . Uh-uh . BIuebacks . - Come on , Snake . - Swear to God , Eddie . This is bigger than cleveland . It sounds thin to me . You want Cuervo to rule the world ? No . That sucks . So how do we get out ? I 'II tell you that when we get there . Oh , PIissken , man , you are such a loser ! Making up shit along the way . That 's why I Ieft you in cleveland . You 're just a chump like the rest of us . No deal ! Government chopper . It 'II be there . OK , that 's better . How are we getting there in an hour ? That 's your end . Edward . Best you could do is take the five . The shape it 's in , two and a half hours minimum . No . Use the air . They 're burning . The Santa Anas . The night wind . - What are you talking about ? - Death from above . I don 't know about this . You don 't like it , don 't come . Where 'd you get these rigs , Carjack ? My name is Hershe . Understand , PIissken ? I got an idea . Got any red nail polish ? - What ? - Come on . I expect that back , Eddie . There . Looks just like the Sword of damocles instruction CD . Maybe we can pull a Texas switch . - If you get close enough . - Don 't worry . The wind 's up . Let 's go ! Shut-down - 34 minutes . Are you ready for the new world ? The attack is now under way ! - What 's going on ? - We 're fucked ! You see PIissken anywhere ? Shut-down - 25 minutes . Get my jet ready . Get it fuelled ready to go . You can 't run away . It 's too late . You have to stand and face it down . Mr President . Commander , we 're receiving reports . An armada of warships has departed Cuba , ETA , florida in 45 minutes .

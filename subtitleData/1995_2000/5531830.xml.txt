 [ Scully ] IT BEGINS WHERE IT ENDS- - IN NOTHINGNESS . A NIGHTMARE BORN FROM DEEPEST FEARS ... COMING TO ME UNGUARDED , WHISPERING IMAGES UNLOCKED FROM TIME AND DISTANCE . A SOUL UNBOUND , TOUCHED BY OTHERS BUT NEVER HELD ... ON A COURSE CHARTED BY SOME UNSEEN HAND . THE JOURNEY AHEAD PROMISING NO MORE ... THAN MY PAST REFLECTED BACK UPON ME ... UNTIL , AT LAST , I REACH THE END , FACING A TRUTH I CAN NO LONGER DENY , ALONE , AS EVER . EXCUSE ME . I 'M LOOKING FOR THE SPECIAL-NEEDS WARD . SECOND DOOR IN THE MAIN HALL . THANKS . EMILY ? I 'D LIKE YOU TO MEET A FRIEND OF MINE . HIS NAME IS MULDER . REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM ? HI . SHE 'S A LITTLE SHY . WHAT ARE YOU COLORING ? A POTATO . HAVE YOU EVER SEEN MR. POTATO HEAD ? HE LOOKS LIKE THIS . DOESN 'T HE ? I 'LL BE RIGHT BACK , OKAY ? THANK YOU FOR COMING . SOMETHING 'S WRONG , ISN 'T IT ? I FOUND EMILY 'S SURROGATE MOTHER . I HAD FROHIKE HACK INTO THE CALIFORNIA SOCIAL SERVICES ADOPTION DATABASE . YOU GOT A NAME ? YEAH . HER MOTHER OF RECORD IS ONE ANNA FUGAZZI . FUGAZZI ? YEAH , AS IN SLANG TERM FOR " FAKE . " I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WHY CREATE A FALSE RECORD ? BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TRUE RECORDS . EMILY DIDN 'T COME INTO THIS WORLD THROUGH ANY SYSTEM THAT KEEPS THEM . WELL , HOW DID SHE COME INTO THIS WORLD ? HAVE YOU ASKED YOURSELF THAT ? WELL , SHE WAS BORN TO SOMEONE . SHE HAD TO BELONG TO SOMEONE . SOMEONE WHO 'S PROVEN THAT THEY 'LL DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT HER ... OR THEIR INTEREST IN HER . I CAN PROTECT HER TOO . AND WHO 'S GONNA PROTECT YOU ? EMILY 'S ADOPTIVE PARENTS ARE BOTH DEAD BY NO ACCIDENT . I KNOW . I- - I 'VE CONSIDERED THAT , BUT I 'VE ALSO CONSIDERED ... THAT THERE 'S ONLY ONE RIGHT THING TO DO . EMILY . WHY DIDN 'T YOU CALL ME SOONER ? BECAUSE I COULDN 'T BELIEVE IT . BUT I NEED YOU NOW TO BE A WITNESS ON MY BEHALF IN THIS HEARING . AND I SHOULD HAVE DECLINED ... IF I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU HURT OR HARMED IN ANY WAY . THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE ? BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN 'T SAID , SOMETHING THAT THEY 'LL USE AGAINST YOU ... TO JEOPARDIZE YOUR CUSTODY OF EMILY . NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THIS LITTLE GIRL , SHE 'S A MIRACLE THAT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE , SCULLY . THEY 'RE READY FOR YOU . [ Man ] AGENT MULDER , HELP ME OUT HERE . DOES F.B.I. STAND FOR FEDERAL BUREAU OF IMAGINATION ? AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PARTNER , ALONG WITH A DOZEN OTHER WOMEN IN ALLENTOWN , PENNSYLVANIA , WAS ABDUCTED BY EMPLOYEES OF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ? SHE WAS MISSING FOR FOUR WEEKS . THAT 'S DOCUMENTED IN THE FILE . AND YOU FOUND EVIDENCE THAT DURING THIS TIME , SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ... WHERE , YOU SAY , THEY EXTRACTED HER OVA ? YES . ALL OF THEM . CAN THAT BE DONE ? I BELIEVE IT CAN ... AND WAS ... AND THAT EMILY SIM WAS CONCEIVED AS A RESULT OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS . AND THAT CAN BE DONE AS WELL ? I DON 'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN IT . A MEDICAL EXAM OF MISS SCULLY WOULD SHOW THAT SHE HASN 'T GIVEN BIRTH . YOU KNOW , UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES , THIS PETITION WOULD BE FAIRLY SIMPLE . BUT I 'M HAVING A HARD TIME WRAPPING MY BRAIN AROUND THIS ... MICHAEL CRICHTON BIT . I INCLUDED THIS INFORMATION IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR REACTION ... AND HOW IT MIGHT LOOK IF YOU RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION . CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION ... WHY ANYONE WOULD KIDNAP MISS SCULLY ... TO CONCEIVE THIS CHILD , THEN PUT IT UP FOR ADOPTION ? NO , BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT MISS SCULLY IS THE MOTHER OF THIS CHILD . NOT IN ANY LEGAL DEFINITION . WELL , IF YOU CAN SHOW ME A LEGAL PRECEDENT FOR THIS CASE , I 'D LIKE TO SEE IT . DANA HAS KNOWN FOR QUITE SOME TIME THAT SHE CAN 'T BEAR CHILDREN . SHE HASN 'T KNOWN WHY . NOW , HOWEVER THAT HAPPENED , THE FACT THAT SHE CAN ADOPT THIS CHILD , HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD , IS SOMETHING I DON 'T FEEL I HAVE THE RIGHT TO QUESTION ... AND I DON 'T BELIEVE ANYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO STAND IN THE WAY OF . TAKES TWO OF US JUST TO GET MY SISTER-IN-LAW INTO BED THESE DAYS . WHEN IS SHE DUE ? TWO WEEKS AGO . WHY DIDN 'T YOU TELL ME , MULDER ? I NEVER EXPECTED THIS . I THOUGHT I WAS PROTECTING YOU . WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS TO ME ? I ONLY KNOW THAT GENETIC EXPERIMENTS WERE BEING DONE , THAT CHILDREN WERE BEING CREATED . CHILDREN BEING CREATED FOR WHO ? FOR WHO ? FOR WHAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . [ Phone Ringing ] HELLO . HELLO ? HELLO . IS ANYBODY THERE ? I NEED A CALL TRACED . AN INCOMING CALL TO RESIDENTIAL LINE 550-0380 . MULDER- - DON 'T HANG UP . OKAY , THANKS . I GOT A TRACE . COUNTY CHILDREN 'S CENTER . [ Pounding ] WHAT IS IT ? WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? HAS ANYONE BEEN HERE IN THE LAST HALF HOUR ? NO . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? SHE 'S BURNING UP . I 'LL CALL 911 . SCULLY . THERE 'S SOMETHING ON HER NECK . OH , MY GOD . OKAY , NOW , THAT DOESN 'T HURT . I 'M GONNA TURN THIS LITTLE THING . ALL RIGHT . I 'LL TRY BACK LATER . I JUST SPOKE TO THE SOCIAL WORKER . SHE HASN 'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH EMILY 'S DOCTOR . HI . HOW IS SHE ? WELL , WE 'VE PUT HER ON A SALINE DRIP TO REHYDRATE HER . SHE 'S RUNNING A FEVER OF ABOUT 102 . IT 'S GOOD YOU GOT HER HERE WHEN YOU DID . DO YOU KNOW WHAT 'S CAUSING IT ? SOME KIND OF INFECTION , PROBABLY RELATED TO THE CYST ON HER NECK . DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS ? NO . I 'M HAVING IT BIOPSIED . I 'LL GET IT OFF TO THE LAB RIGHT AWAY . NOW , ARE YOU TWO THE PARENTS ? - I 'M HER MOTHER . - OH , OKAY . WELL , CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY HISTORY THAT MIGHT HELP ? I KNOW THAT SHE WAS BEING TREATED FOR ANEMIA . DO YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE ? I WAS TOLD ... THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA . HER TREATMENT IS EXPERIMENTAL . WHO 'S HER DOCTOR ? HIS NAME IS CALDERON . I DON 'T KNOW HIM . EMILY , I 'M GONNA ROLL YOU ONTO YOUR SIDE , SWEETIE . WAIT ! WAIT , WAIT , WAIT . STOP ! STOP ! MOVE AWAY FROM HER ! - MOVE AWAY FROM HER ! - SIR , I NEED TO GET IN THERE . [ Mulder ] GET AWAY FROM HER ! GET AWAY ! DON 'T GO IN THERE . [ Gasping ] IS SHE STILL SLEEPING ? THEY HAVE HER ON A MILD SEDATIVE . THE E.R. DOCTOR IS IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS . HOW DID YOU KNOW ? IF EMILY IS SOMEONE 'S CREATION , THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT SHE MIGHT SHARE THE SAME BODY CHEMISTRY ... THAT WE 'VE SEEN BEFORE . I HAD THEM PUT THE DOCTOR IN A COOLING BATH LIKE YOU DID WHEN I WAS EXPOSED TO THIS . SO WHAT NOW ? I MEAN , SHE 'S STILL JUST A LITTLE GIRL . YOU SAY THAT I CAN 'T PROTECT HER , BUT I CAN 'T LET THIS BE HER LIFE . JUST A FEW DAYS AGO , SHE WAS FINE . SHE WAS ALSO BEING TREATED . I NEED SOME ADVICE . WITH EVERYTHING THAT 'S HAPPENING HERE , I 'M A LITTLE AT SEA . THIS DR. CALDERON YOU SAY IS EMILY 'S PHYSICIAN ? HE 'S REFUSING TO TRANSFER HER MEDICAL RECORDS . HE CAN 'T DO THAT . HE 'S ENDANGERING HER LIFE . HE SAID EMILY WAS IN HIS CARE , AND IF YOU 'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR STOPPING THAT , THEN YOU 'RE THE ONE ENDANGERING HER . IT 'S AN ETHICAL VIOLATION . HE SAYS SHE WAS PART OF A DOUBLE-BLIND MEDICAL TRIAL ... AND THAT HE 'S SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT IT . HE ALSO SAYS YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY OVER THIS CHILD . WELL , AUTHORITY OR NOT , I 'M NOT LEAVING HER SIDE . IT 'S BEYOND ME , I 'M AFRAID . BUT IT 'S NOT BEYOND DR. CALDERON . I 'D LIKE TO SAY RIGHT UP FRONT THAT I KNOW EMILY SIM PERSONALLY ... AS YOUR PARTNER PROBABLY TOLD YOU , AND , UH- - MY GOD , I NEVER MET A SWEETER , MORE COURAGEOUS LITTLE GIRL . I 'M SO SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT HER DOWNTURN . MY HOPE IS THAT THESE CUSTODY ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED ... SO THAT SHE CAN RESUME HER TREATMENT HERE . BUT I 'M AFRAID I SIMPLY CAN 'T RELEASE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HER ... AS IT RELATES TO OUR COMPANY 'S EXPERIMENTAL DRUG TRIALS . WHAT CAN I SAY TO CONVINCE YOU ? IT 'S REALLY NOT ABOUT CONVINCING ME . THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- - WELL , THAT WE SIMPLY CANNOT DO . IT 'S PURELY A BUSINESS REALITY . IT HAS TO DO WITH PRANGEN 'S EXPOSURE TO LITIGATION . AND , OF COURSE , I 'LL NEED TO PROTECT RESEARCH ... WHICH , FRANKLY , REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT DOLLAR INVESTMENT . SO I 'M WASTING YOUR TIME . THIS IS NOT WORTH THE LIFE OF A THREE-YEAR-OLD GIRL . I WOULDN 'T FRAME IT LIKE THAT . THAT 'S NOT IT AT ALL . LOOK , I 'M TRULY SORRY , BUT THERE 'S REALLY NOTHING I CAN DO . HOWEVER , I DO WISH YOU THE VERY BEST . OKAY , THEN . HOW YOU FEELING NOW ? A LITTLE MORE HELPFUL ? CONDESCENDING LIAR ! HELP ! WHY DON 'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOUR COMPANY IS REALLY IN BUSINESS FOR ? HUH ? ABDUCTING WOMEN AND STEALING THEIR UNBORN CHILDREN . MEDICAL RAPISTS , THAT 'S ALL YOU ARE ! NOW YOU 'RE GONNA LET THAT LITTLE GIRL DIE ? SHE 'S JUST A LAB RAT TO YOU ! WHY DON 'T YOU TELL ME WHOSE LIFE IS WORTH SAVING- - YOURS OR HERS ? I WANT EVERYTHING TO HELP THAT LITTLE GIRL ! [ Door Opens ] I 'LL BE BACK . [ Alarm Chirps ] WE 'RE READY . CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE WITH HER ? HI . [ TV Character ] SOMETHING WAS GOING AND GOT WORSE . HEY , LOOFAH SPONGE . WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? SWEETIE . IN A MINUTE A NURSE IS GONNA TAKE YOU TO DO SOME TESTS . MOMMY SAID NO MORE TESTS . WE JUST WANT YOU TO GET BETTER . THAT 'S WHAT THESE TESTS ARE ABOUT . [ Whirring ] [ Whirring Continues ] HE CAME TO SEE ME . HE KNOWS I 'M INVOLVED . NOW YOU BROUGHT HIM TO SEE US . UH , WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM ? NOTHING . [ Alarm Chirps ] I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS . A NEOPLASTIC MASS , A TUMOROUS INFECTION . THE CYST IN THE BACK OF EMILY 'S NECK SEEMS TO BE THE POINT OF ORIGIN . AND FROM HER BLOOD TEST LAST NIGHT AND HER SED READ THIS MORNING , IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE GROWING RAPIDLY . IS IT CANCER ? NO . CANCER GROWS OUT OF CONTROL . THESE ARE ANAEROBIC CHANNELS FOLLOWING THE PATH OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM . THEY HAVE THE EFFECT OF KILLING THE SURROUNDING TISSUE , DEPRIVING IT OF THE OXYGEN IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE . ITS POINT OF ORIGIN IS PROXIMAL TO THE BRAIN AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM . IT COULDN 'T BE IN A WORSE PLACE . CAN YOU PUT HER ON ANTIVIRALS ? I 'VE GOT HER ON A LEVOPHED DRIP TO KEEP HER BLOOD PRESSURE UP . SHE 'S GETTING STEROIDS INTRAVENOUSLY TO BRING DOWN INFLAMMATION . WE COULD ATTEMPT RADIATION THERAPY . NO , YOU CAN 'T DO THAT . HER IMMUNE SYSTEM 'S TOO WEAK . WELL , WHAT CAN YOU DO ? HAS ANYONE SPOKEN TO DR. CALDERON ABOUT THIS ? DR. CALDERON ? [ Beeping ] GET DR. VINET IN THERE AND CALL THE POLICE . [ Woman ] DR. VINET TO ISOLATION . DR. VINET TO ISOLATION . HALT ! DR. CALDERON ! F.B.I. ! STOP THAT MAN ! [ Cell Phone Ringing ] YEAH . [ Scully ] MULDER , WHERE ARE YOU ? I 'M FOLLOWING DR. CALDERON . WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU 'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HIM ? I JUST SAW HIM . THERE WAS A SCARE HERE . WHERE ? HE WAS HERE . HE CAME INTO EMILY 'S ROOM . IT APPEARS AS IF HE INJECTED HER WITH SOMETHING . IS SHE ALL RIGHT ? SHE SEEMS TO BE . BUT WE 'RE RUNNING A TOX SCREEN ANYWAY . WHATEVER HE INJECTED HER WITH , I DON 'T THINK HE MEANT TO HARM HER . - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? - I THINK DR. CALDERON WENT THERE TO TRY TO TREAT HER . THAT DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . WHY WOULD HE ENDANGER HER BEFORE ONLY TO PROTECT HER NOW ? AS A BLUFF . I DON 'T THINK THEY WANT HER DEAD EITHER , BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS . LOOK , I 'M GONNA CATCH UP WITH YOU , ALL RIGHT ? DETECTIVE . HAPPY NEW YEAR . THANKS FOR COMING DOWN . I 'M POSTING TWO COPS OUTSIDE HER ROOM . THAT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY . WHAT IF THIS GUY CALDERON IS THINKING ABOUT COMING BACK ? THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME INDICATION THAT HE CAME HERE TO HELP HER . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . YOU SAID ON THE PHONE ... THAT HE WAS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO THE DEATH OF EMILY 'S PARENTS . BECAUSE EMILY 'S MOTHER WANTED TO STOP THE TESTS , JUST LIKE I DID . AND I GUESS THAT 'S WHY HE CAME HERE . BECAUSE AS MUCH AS THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO REMOVE WHAT GETS IN THEIR WAY , IT SEEMS THAT THEY NEED EMILY TO CONTINUE THE TESTS . [ Knocking ] HELLO . ANNA FUGAZZI ? YES . YOUR NAME IS ANNA FUGAZZI ? YES . ARE YOU THE NEW DOCTOR ? NO , I 'M NOT . IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME ? YES , FOR THE LAST 71 YEARS . WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME ? NOT UNTIL NOW . [ Scully ] I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . JUST AN HOUR AGO YOU SAID THAT SHE WAS GETTING BETTER . THAT 'S RIGHT . HER FEVER 'S DOWN . HER VITAL SIGNS ARE NEARLY BACK TO NORMAL . BUT THESE LATEST M.R.I. ' s ARE TELLING ME ... THAT THIS GROWTH HAS CONTINUED TO SPREAD . IN HER ARMS , I 'M NOW SEEING WHAT LOOKS LIKE ... A NECROTIZING OF THE TISSUE . IT 'S KILLING HER . WHATEVER IT IS , IT MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRESENT IN SOME AMOUNT . BASICALLY , IT 'S SHUT DOWN HER BODY ... WHILE IT CONTINUES TO GROW . WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL THAT SHE 'S NOT IN ANY PAIN . I PRESENTED ALL THIS INFORMATION TO THE COURT . AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS GREAT CONCERN ... THAT YOU ARE MAKING DECISIONS FOR THIS CHILD . AND THEY SEEM TO BE HAVING NO SMALL EFFECT ON HER HEALTH . MISS CHAMBLISS , I AM A MEDICAL DOCTOR , AND THE DECISIONS THAT I MAKE ARE REASONABLE AND RIGHT . BUT I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE IN THIS REPORT THAT DR. CALDERON 'S TREATMENT ... HAS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN A TURNAROUND . NO , THAT 'S NOT TRUE . THE INJECTION THAT DR. CALDERON GAVE HER IS ACTUALLY MAKING HER WORSE . MISS SCULLY , I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU , AND I DON 'T WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY . BUT I DON 'T THINK THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE RIGHT NOW ... OF RESPONDING WITH ANY CLINICAL ABILITY . DO YOU THINK I DON 'T WANT WHAT 'S BEST FOR THIS CHILD ? DO YOU THINK THAT I 'M NOT TRYING TO SAVE HER LIFE ? I 'M SAYING THAT I 'M GETTING WILDLY DIFFERING REPORTS . I HAVE A JOB TO DO . I 'M NOT THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY HERE , BUT YOU DON 'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY EITHER ... OVER THIS CHILD OR HER FUTURE . YOU CAN GET A COURT ORDER , AND YOU CAN TRY AND ENFORCE IT . BUT I SUGGEST THAT IF YOUR JOB IS TO DO WHAT 'S BEST FOR THIS CHILD , YOU DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO TELL THE AUTHORITIES ... THAT IF THEY TAKE EMILY OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL , THEY ARE GOING TO HASTEN HER ILLNESS , AND I WILL MAKE IT KNOWN THAT ALL OF YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE . WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM YOU 'RE DOING FOR HER ? I DON 'T KNOW YET , BUT I WILL . CHRISTINA SHERMAN ... DELIVERED A HEALTHY BABY GIRL SEPTEMBER 25 , 1994 . GRETCHEN MILLER . DELIVERED A BABY BOY MARCH 18 , 1996 . EVELYN BURMEISTER . EVELYN BURMEISTER . DELIVERED A BABY BOY ... JUNE 21 , 1994 . THAT MAKES EIGHT FOR EIGHT . ARE YOU IN ADOPTION SERVICES , MULDER ? NO , I 'M AT THE MATERNITY WARD . ANY FETCHING YOUNG MOTHERS IN THERE ? YOU MIGHT HAVE A SHOT HERE , FROHIKE . YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PHARMACEUTICALS ? MEDICINAL OR , UH , RECREATIONAL ? THERE 'S TWO PRESCRIPTIONS ON THEIR MED CHARTS THAT ALL THESE WOMEN HAVE IN COMMON . ABBREVIATED- - PMZ 200 AND DURTAB . ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE . HORMONES . THAT DOESN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE . PREGNANT WOMEN HAVE THOSE HORMONES IN ABUNDANCE . YOU WOULDN 'T GIVE THOSE TO PREGNANT WOMEN . YOU WOULD THESE . ANNA . THERE 'S A DOCTOR THAT COMES TO VISIT YOU , A DR. CALDERON . YES . DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS ? ACTUALLY , I 'M LOOKING FOR HIM . HE 'S SUPPOSED TO BE HERE . I WAS GOING TO START MY BEAUTY SLEEP . YOUR BEAUTY SLEEP . WHAT IS THAT ? HE SAID IT 'S TAKEN YEARS OFF MY APPEARANCE . YOU OKAY IN THERE , EMILY ? GOOD . I 'M GONNA BE RIGHT HERE THE WHOLE TIME , OKAY ? WE 'RE GONNA PUT EXTRA AIR IN THERE , SO LET ME KNOW IF YOUR EARS START TO HURT . [ Hissing ] YOU OKAY , SWEETIE ? TURN IT OFF . - TURN IT OFF NOW ! - I 'M DOING IT , MA 'AM . IT 'S OKAY , SWEETIE . SETTLE DOWN . WE 'RE GONNA GET YOU OUT OF THERE AS FAST AS WE CAN , OKAY ? FLINCH AND YOU 'RE DEAD . HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE ' EM . WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE ? JUST GIVE IT TO ME SLOWLY .

STOP RIGHT THERE . RUN . GET OUT OF HERE . DON 'T USE YOUR GUN . GET OUT OF HERE ! I SAID STOP RIGHT THERE . - KRESGE ! - I SAID STOP RIGHT THERE . DON 'T FIRE , KRESGE ! I 'M AN F.B.I. AGENT .

I GOT BACKUP COMING . THEY NEED A LOCATION THOUGH . I 'LL TAKE CARE OF IT . JUST WATCH THE GUY . DETECTIVE KRESGE IS GOING TO RADIO IN THE LOCATION . SHE 'S GONE INTO A COMA . I 'M OKAY , MULDER . IT 'S WHAT 'S MEANT TO BE . BUT IF YOU COULD TREAT HER- - I WOULDN 'T . I WOULDN 'T DO IT TO HER . ARE YOU SURE ? MULDER , WHOEVER BROUGHT THIS CHILD INTO THIS WORLD ... DIDN 'T INTEND TO LOVE HER . I THINK SHE WAS- - SHE WAS BORN TO SERVE AN AGENDA . I HAVE A CHANCE TO STOP THAT . YOU WERE RIGHT . THIS CHILD WAS NOT MEANT TO BE . I 'LL STAY WITH YOU . I THINK I 'D LIKE TO BE ALONE . ARE YOU READY ? I THINK I 'LL GET A RIDE BACK WITH MULDER . BYE-BYE , MATTHEW . WE 'LL SEE YOU AT HOME , OKAY ? WHO ARE THE MEN WHO WOULD CREATE A LIFE WHOSE ONLY HOPE IS TO DIE ? I DON 'T KNOW . BUT THAT YOU FOUND HER ... AND YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOVE HER- - MAYBE SHE WAS MEANT FOR THAT TOO . SHE FOUND ME . SO YOU COULD SAVE HER . HOW 'S DETECTIVE KRESGE ? HE 'S DOING BETTER . HE 'S OUT OF THE I.C.U. AND THE MEN WHO DID THIS TO HIM ? THEY ALREADY CLEANED UP THE NURSING HOME . ALL THE WOMEN ARE BEING PLACED IN NEW HOMES . THERE 'S NO EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE ELSE AT THE PRANGEN CORPORATION ... KNEW OF CALDERON 'S WORK . THERE IS EVIDENCE OF WHAT THEY DID . [ Child ] I MADE THIS .

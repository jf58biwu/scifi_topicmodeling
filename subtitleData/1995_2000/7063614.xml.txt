 Journal entry number 11345-1 . 3 : 20 p.m. , Thursday , June 6th . The concentration of serotonin has been increased by two milligrams ... and dissolved in a 0.8 saline solution . Uh-uh , point 5 . Correction , 0.5 saline . Yesterday 's slight increase didn 't make any difference in tissue absorption . Mmm . We 're optimistic that the serotonin increase will be sufficient to produce an intensified level of aggression without causing harmful side affects . Where 's McConnel ? If this new solution proves effective in the animals ... we will begin human testing . Hey ... the gang 's all here . All right ... final phase . We hope to be able to show that aggressive behavior is triggered by fluctuations in brain chemistry , as well as fluctuations in neurotransmitters , such as serotonin . Spank me harder , baby . Oh , sorry . Ethanol oestradiol , LHRH . Maintained at minus 15 degrees Celsius . If we can prove Dr. Burns ' theory ... then we believe by manipulating the level of MAO-A enzyme , which breaks down neuro - transmitters ... we should be able to control aggressive and hyperactive behavior . One milligram of ethanol oestradiol to increase plasma testosterone . E-Mail for Doctor Irwin Burns . Urgent . Now whatl ? What 's going on ? All right . Increase the serotonin by 25 milligrams ... and add 20 milligrams of the amantadine . Hello ? What are you guys doing ? Dr. Burns had carefully measured that . Exactly ! Carefully , carefully , carefully . Breakthroughs aren 't made carefully and conservatively , daddy 's little girl . Science is about taking risks and pushing boundaries . But we 've been making such progress . Okay , 25 more milligrams of ethanol oestradiol . You think so ? I 've made more progress in one day with my own testing than your father 's made in three goddamn years . Not that he 'd now it of course , because he never listens to me . What are you talking about ? He highly values your expertise . Bullshit ! He keeps everything under lock and key . He 's so secretive , he 's gotta do it all himself . Cause he 's a paranoid , old wimpy geek . It 's time we made some goddamn progress around here . Hmm . Toshi , how can you betray him ? , how can you betray him ? , how can you betray him ? She 's just as sick of your father as I am . - But he is in charge of this . - Not any more . And there 's nothing he can do about it . Sixteen milligrams of rubidium , and ten milligrams of ethyl alcohol . Don 't bother . I changed the key code . Open this door . I demand that you open this door ! Irwin ! Irwin ! Oh shit ! It 's reacting . Kat h ryn ? That shouldn 't be happening . We checked the calculations three times . McConnel : oh , shit ! : oh , shit ! : Oh , shit ! I ; Dad : I ; Dad : Kathryn ! Oh , God ... Kat h Kat h Kat h fyn ! Kathryn ! Aaaah ! Oh , God . Kathryn . Kathryn ! Kat h ryn ! Kat h ryn ! Come on . Row , row , row your boat , gently down the street merrily , merrily life 's a bowl of treats . Row , row , row your boat gently down the street ... Row , row row your boat gently down the street ... merrily , merrily , merrily merrily , merrily , merrily ... pop goes the weasel . I 'm telling . You 're in big trouble . Scaredy cat . Scaredy cat . Scaredy cat . I hate you . I 'm telling mom . Looks like you 'll be around a couple more years . Well , the Mrs. ' ll be disappointed . So , I 'm not having a heart attack , huh , Brad ? It 's probably just a had case of indigestion . But let me go check on those test results . Maybe it 's just Betty 's sausages . Mmm . I 'm gonna miss those . I 'll be right hack . Poor thing . Brad breaking ' her heart like that That 's not what I heard . I heard he wanted her to move to the city with him ... but she turned him down flat . What a shame , those two were made for each other . Maybe she 'll change her mind . She 's got too much of her father 's stubbornness . You know those Biddies . Maybe he 'll change his mind . Thanks , Sam . Have a nice day . Just as I thought , everything 's fine . If you weren 't carryin' around this baby ... you 'd be a whole lot better off . This baby 's the lifeblood of this town . And I can guarantee a couple of inches by the end of the festival . Rumor has it , Juergen 's outdone himself with this years brew . Mm-mmm . So I 'm told . You do plan on hanging out with us small town folk at least through the weekend , don 't you ? Nope . Gotta go tomorrow . Well , we 're all gonna miss ya . Especially a certain pretty cop I know . Who happens to get her good looks from her daddy . I 'm only four hours away . Dr. Kagen , something 's wrong . I don 't know what to do . He won 't talk , I found him lying in the woods- - Slow down , Mrs. Stills . Take it easy . Let 's just get him on the table . Let me get out of your way . Grace , don 't worry , the doctor 'll take care of Mikey . Everything 's gonna be all right . Thanks , Mayor . I 've never seen him like this . I can 't get him to respond . - What 's wrong with him ? - He 's in shock . I can 't even get him to let go of his toy . Let 's go . I got him . 25 yards . Northeast . Son of a bitch . I see him . Watch out ! Watch out ! - He 's right there . - Shoot , damn it . Shoot ! Damn ! All right , Jesse . Kickin ' ass ! The bushmaster ! Oh , man , what a chase . Let 's see the trophy , Jess . No more hoppin ' for you Mr. Rabbit . Oh , man . Hey , Corky . Hey , Corky . Hey , girl . Hey , Corky . Come on fetch . Damn lazy dog . Oh , I almost forgot . I got something for you . Thanks . That was , uh , that was sweet . Oh , cool . This is the exact one I wanted . How 'd you know ? Where 'd you get it ? Jesse doesn 't carry this one . I had him , um , special order that for you . It 's got 256k . You got rolodex , you got dayplanner . Plus an alarm , world time , map , reminder , password access . Yes , yes , yes . And you can hackload it all on your computer . I know this is the one I wanted . They 're great . I was gonna get one for myself , but um ... you know me , I 'm more of a paper and pen kinda gal . Besides there 's nothing like the smell of a good leather binder . What am I doing ? What am I doing ? It 's so easy to slip hack . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Jo . You know how I feel about you ... but I , I can 't do this . It 's not , it 's not fair for either of us . I don 't want to change my mind . There 's just ... there 's just so many things that I ... that I want to accomplish , things I 'm never gonna get to do in a small town . I mean you have to go to the city , the big city ... to be a specialist , to be at the big hospital ... I 'm tired of everybody knowing everybody else 's business , and I ... I know , I know we 've been through all this before hut ... I wish you would change your mind and come . Just , just come with me please ? We have been through this before . The timing 's off . Your wants and needs are ... are different than mine . I 'm happy here and you 're not . Beside 's we 're like , what , only four hours away ? Yeah . Jo , you there ? Jo ? Yeah , Ben , go ahead . Call just came in from old man Simpson 's . Sounds pretty serious . Find Pat and bring him with you . Dr. Kagen 's still fishing . He won 't be hack till tomorrow . Damn ... Has Brad left yet ? I think he 's still around . Well , find him . We need him . Be right there . I 'm sure it 's nothing . Brad , glad you 're still around . Ya just caught me , I 'm leaving tomorrow . - Nice to see you , Brad . - Yeah , you too , Bud . So whatta we got ? Well , we got a call from Jimmy Ray . He was delivering groceries when he found Simpson inside . - What 's wrong with him ? - Well , he 's pretty dead . What happened ? Tryin ' to figure that out . Seems old man Simpson was chopping wood here , when somethin ' must a surprised him and attacked him . Somethin ' what ? Tryin ' to figure that out . And he struggled to make it all the way inside . What 's this from ? You 're trying to figure that out . Uh-huh . You know guys , Simpson had a dog . Yeah , that 's right . Corky . - Hey Bud , would you ? - Yeah , I 'll take a look . Hey , Bud . Watch your step . Somethin ' wanted to get inside pretty damn bad . Jeez . Ugh . What is that from ? I 'm not sure . Corky . Corky ? Come here , girl . Corky ! Come on , girl . Got a nice big bone for ya . Okay , a big juicy steak . That 's my final offer . Jesus Christ . Hand me my forceps . Is that what I think it is ? I 've never seen one so- - Hey , get a load of this . Grab this end . Jesus ... I guess we 're not gonna find Corky . Haemotoxins cause a breakdown of the blood cells leading to local bruising and internal bleeding . Neurotoxins affect the central nervous system especially the part controlling respiration and the heart . As much as you got . Yep . Perfect . I said two p.m. , guys . Where is it ? - Yeah ? - Jo , it 's me . Hey . - Hey . - Hey thanks . Power company 's got an a.m. / p.m. learning disability . - Hello ? - Dr. Burns ? - Speaking . - Phil , City Hospital Pharmacy . I just received an unusual antivenin request that I think you want to know about . It 's from a town in close proximity . This year 's hops have a real unique aroma , flavor , and character , making the new Fillmore Lager ... Juergy , Juergy , Juergy . - Juergen . - You 're so cute . As if I really care what hops are . For me . Hops ? A bunny rabbit hops . This is not about beer . This is about , I know it sounds funny ... it 's about image . Coolness . Prestige . If you 're not drinking Fillmore Lager you 're out . Passe . Like roller-skates , record players , and Riunite on ice . You know what I mean ? No . What I know about ... is that this year 's brew is the best it 's ever been . And everyone 's going to know that . - Juergy . - Juergen . Whatever . This is how it works : You start with a good product , which you have . Yah , we use only the finest malt , rice , yeast . Exactly . You 're the hrewmeister . Then you need a consistent message like ... " Fillmore up . The big-time small-town taste . " Which we will kick off at this year 's festival . Juer , Juergy . Thank you . We got these bands . We got the babes , we got the boys ... we got nationwide coverage . All you have to worry about is keepin ' the beer flowing ' . It 's gonna be huge . It 's not only me that 's counting on this . It 's out of the question . But Mayor , this is an extremely dangerous medical situation . If we have a problem here , let 's solve it . Let 's not blow it outta proportion . It 's already out of proportion . Ben , are you tellin ' me we can 't handle one stinkin ' snake ? Until I know what I 'm up against I can 't answer that . Jesus ! How many snakes did we shoot when we were kids ? Come on . You didn 't see what this thing did to Simpson . And he had an ax in his hand . Snakebites usually aren 't fatal Tell that to Simpson . He probably had an allergic reaction . He was old , he had a weak heart which would make him more affected by the hemolytic principle in the venom . And he lived alone in the middle of nowhere . Did you see the size of this fang ? The venom disintegrated half his face . I saw the body , Brad . A lot of people got a lot riding on the future of this brewery . Including most of us in this room here . And if I cancel this festival ... Fillmore Lager remains a great beer that only locals know about . And it 's gonna cost this town a lotta money . I got a responsibility to see that that don 't happen . Mayor , mayor , with all due respect ... people are here now . People who don 't know their way around nature . City people . There 's a lotta camping gain ' on , a lotta drinking ' ... and we don 't know what this thing is capable of . Let 's send ' em home now . I won 't do that . At least , let 's move it somewhere safer . - That 's got better crowd control . - What about Central Avenue ? Let 's make it a street festival . Yeah , then we can block off the other streets . Biddle Park 's been the tradition ... that 's why a lotta people come here . We 're talkin ' about a snake here . A creature that eats rodents , small animals and other snakes . Maybe that 's why the crops are so good this year . Because of a monster snake . Pardon me for interrupting ... I was told I could find Dr. Kagen here . I 'm Doctor Kagen . What can I do for you ? Dr. Brad Kagen ? I 'm Brad Kagen . - Who are you ? - I 'm Doctor Irwin Burns . I understand that you have requested a large amount of polyvalent antivenin . - You 're from City Hospital ? - No . I 'm a biochemist . And what can we do for you , Dr. Burns ? If I can confirm the presence of these chemicals , then we 'll know for sure if it was Seth . Venom entered through a bite on the lower left calf . We also found traces of venom in his eyes , probably causing blindness prior to death . I was surprised that he was able to make it to the house . There 's also two puncture marks indicating a bite behind the right ear , just under the hairline which I initially missed . That would account for the hemorrhaging . So , uh , what caused the accident ? My lack of people skills . Damn needle in a haystack . We need a herpetologist . I know someone . - You 're sure it 's him ? - There 's no doubt . The sloughed skin and chemical compounds confirm it . Oh , now that we know what we 're dealing with ... I think we should call City Hospital hack and get the proper antivenin . Polyvalent may be insufficient . We gotta find Seth and destroy him before he kills again . Nice , very nice . Confidence . It 's all about confidence . Pressure to the head . Steady . Good . - Yes ? - Hash ... you have a very important phone call . Thank you . I 'll take it in my office . I gotta take this call , okay ? You keep working . Don 't get too cocky now . Expect the unexpected . Damn . Penelope . I 'm comin ' , I 'm comin ' . You naughty girl . Penelope ? Oh come on , I wasn 't away that long . Fine , more for me . This is Eric Anderson broadcasting from Biddle Park . We 're at the Fillmore Lager Beer Festival . We 're coming to you with some crazy people here , we 've got Fumes . Brewfest . Brewfest . Please leave a message . Dad , you there ? Burns confirmed that Simpson 's death had to be from his snake . The Mayor 's being really stubborn about this and I think you 're gonna need to , um ... just give me a call when you get this . Hey , hey whoa , guys . Slow down . Party 's the other way . Nothin 's gain ' on around here . Good night . Wyatt Earp . Keeper of the peace . It 's a livin ' . Sheriff told me I 'd find you here . So how 's it goin " ! Oh , drunk guys , I can handle . 30 foot snakes , I don 't know about . Burns called in a herpetologist . - A herpewhat ? - Snake expert . Supposedly , he 's one of the best . Should be able to help you guys out . Right . Right . So you 're still goin " ! They 're expectin ' me tomorrow . I 'm already late . Who 's gonna administer antivenin if this thing can 't be stopped ? The town doctor , Pat Kagen . Okay . So , where 's your dad anyway ? I didn 't see him at the festival . I don 't know . I haven 't seen him since this morning . I left a message for him on the answering machine . I go on patrol in about ten minutes . If you like , I can check in on him . Yeah , I 'd appreciate that , Jo . Thanks . I gotta go finish packing ' . Yeah , sure Brad . Dr. Kagen . DI ' . Kaye " ? Pat ! Pat . Pat . Pat ! Pat . Look , we don 't know for sure . Maybe he got away . Let 's not have any false hopes here . Even if he did get away the venom would 've killed him and we 'd have found his body by now . I 'm sorry . That 's all I can say . I 'm truly sorry . I 'll shut it down now . There 's no immediate danger . Repeat , there 's no immediate danger . I always wanted me a pair of them snakeskin boots . From what I hear we could open a goddamn store . Let 's go kick some ass . Well sir , the Still 's sighting was here . The two teenagers disappeared here . Simpson 's place is here . And the most recent attack of , uh was here . Okay , and that 's all the attacks you know about ? Yeah . That we know about . Well ... it 's pretty clear that he 's marked out his territory . That 's a pretty large area , my friend . He 's a pretty large snake . Dr. Burns ... how did you manage to cross an African King Cobra , with an Eastern Diamondback rattlesnake ? Gene splicing . Gene splicing . Interesting . Why would anyone want to combine two of the most deadly species of poisonous snakes ? We wanted the most aggressive animals possible for testing . Fascinating . Foolish . So , how do we get rid of it ? Well , first we have to find it , of course . I want to make sure that we all know and respect exactly what we 're dealing with here . Respect ? Yeah , um ... you see in order to overcome a deadly opponent ... you have to learn to think like it . I hate snakes . All right . Consider , Deputy Fuller ... snakes kill in one year more people than sharks kill in 100 years . They are responsible for more deaths than all the other dangerous animals in the world combined . Now that is a power you have to learn to respect just a little hit . Let 's consider Ophiophagus Hannah , 0l 'I ... the African King Cobra . Its venom , a tablespoon , even dried , could kill 165 people or 165,000 mice . Oh , and then there is Vihoras de Cascaheles . Spanish for rattlesnake . Rattlesnakes can strike at ten feet per second . It has the most highly developed fangs of all the venomous snakes . Now , my whole point is ... as if nature wasn 't good enough , and thanks to science ... we now have here ... a specimen with all these beautiful traits . Come on , Buck ! Over here ! Check it out . We 're gonna need bigger guns . Hey , hey . Snakes pick up on vibrations in the ground . Okay , so we want to make as little noise as possible . But here 's the game plan . We 're gonna pound stakes into the ground , that 's the reason for the rubber mallet . We 're gonna attach the razor wire to each stake with this wire and that 's the reason for the cutters and the gloves . So remember , work as quietly as you can ... look out for anything that might be moving ... and , um , expect the unexpected . Is that all you got ? Yeah . Why ? Don 't you have some kind of modern technology to fight this thing ? These are the tools of my trade , Brad . I 've been at this for over 25 years . But this is not an ordinary snake . The methodology for catching a snake doesn 't change . Besides I 've made some modifications . Why don 't we just shoot the damn thing ? Sure , let 's shoot him , be my guest . Go on shoot ' em . He 's that tree over there . Shoot . Fine you want me to shoot him ? I 'll shoot that tree . If you want to kill him instead of just pissing him off , you 're gonna have to hit him in the head . That 's that rock about six inches off the ground . No , that 's not him , there he is over there , he 's that tree . He 's going through the leaves through the leaves ... there he is at ten o 'clock . Go ahead shoot him , man . Okay , okay , I got the idea . You better get it ... because if you don 't you 're dead . Now you 're calm right now . But you see this guy eyeball to eyeball your adrenaline is going to kick in and you will not be calm . There 's probably two people amongst us here ... okay , maybe one ... that maybe , maybe could get off a shot ... if we get lucky and if we get a chance . Believe me , guys ... the gun is not the way to go , at best it 's only a backup . You 're gonna go up there now ? Yeah , thought I 'd take a look , check some things out . I 'll come with you . No , you 'll stay here . What happened to never being alone in case of a bite ? You know , I am qualified for that . Ah , I almost forgot , doctor . Can you ride a hike ? Yeah , I think so . There 's an extra one in there . Why the bikes ? Less vibrations . Gets you closer to the action . Besides I ain 't a very good runner . I 'm Japanese . Japanese were not built to run , we were built to last . Brad , be careful . Jo , you there ? Yeah , Ben , go ahead . How 's it 9 ° I " 9 ' - ' We 're setting up camp . Brad and Hash went to take a look around . Do you guys see anything by you ? - No sign of it . - Where are you guys ? Oh , about a mile past Canyon Creek . Gonna head over toward Jackson farm . You guys be careful . Yeah , you too . What is that ? Shit . I think it 's him . I think it 's him . Jeez . Holy shit . I think it 's him . I think it 's him . Jesus , this sucker 's huge . Son of a bitch . It 's already dead . Hey , saws ! I got ' em . He 's already dead ! Billy . Billy ! Jesse , Conrad ! Jesse , Conrad ! Oh my God , oh ml ! - Come on ! Billy ! Billy what happened ? Did you get bit ? Billy show me where you 're hit . Get his clothes off so we can see where he 's hit . Jesus Christ , his pulse is going through the roof . Get a tourniquet ready ! Billy , hang in there , buddy . Billy ! Jesus . Oh shit man , come on , do something . Try CPR . He 's dead . No , no he can 't , he can 't he ... if we suck the venom out , he 'll be all right . He 's dead , Buck . No , no , he can 't he . He can 't he . Buck ! God damn it ! It can 't be far , let 's go get it . What about Billy ? There 's nothing we can do for him now . We 'll come hack for him . All right , spread out . I wanna get that son of a bitch . Oh God . I don 't wanna die . Buck ! Get it together ! Come on . Time to die you son of a-- - Oh shit , we 're screwed , we 're screwed ! Conrad . Conrad ! Conrad ! Conrad ! Oh God . Get out of the way . Oh shit . Hold still . Jesse move . They play dead ? Yeah , like a dog . Cohras 'll do that sometimes to lure their prey in . They 're very clever . What is it ? Here , hold this hack . Snake shit . That 's uric acid crystals , nitrogenous waste . Snake piss . It 's still pretty fresh . He can 't be too far . What ? You see something ? Shh ! Someone 's coming . There . That 's Buck . Buck ! Buck ! Buck . Buck . Buck ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? What happened ? What happened ? What are you , what , what happened ? Huh ? What happened ? Oh shit . Back up slowly ... one step at a time . Calm , calm . Ben ! Open the door , Ben . Ben , open the door , man ! Open the damn door . Let 's go man ! Let 's get the hell out of here ! Will you shut up ? We 're not gain ' anywhere . We finally found the damn thing . Okay , buddy boy , respect it , love it . Maybe it knocked itself out . Guess not . I 'll be a son of a- - It 's popped the damn tires , man ! Good deduction , Sherlock . Where the hell is it , man ? Tryin ' to figure that out . Maybe it left . - So go check . - Are you crazy , man ? ! I almost lost my love jones out there . I ain 't gain ' nowhere ! Oh shit . Come on , baby . Come on . Oh shit . Blld ! Hang in there , Bud . Blld . So , what 's in the syringe ? Saltwater base with a high concentration of King Cobra venom . I thought you said a spoonful would kill a hundred men . Yeah , it would . But I 've been bitten so many times ... and injected myself with increased dosages over the years that- - That you body 's built up the antibodies to counteract the venom . Jeez , he 's like a walking supply of antivenin . Somethin ' like that . You okay ? I 'm all right . How many times you been bit ? A few times too many . How often you inject yourself ? Couple times a month . See , I can 't let my antibodies slide ... otherwise I gotta start all over and build ' em up again . My blood has saved a few lives over the years . When I kick the bucket , no one will care about my organs , but my blood could be worth millions . So what was your worst bite ? Well , none of ' em were exactly pleasant . But , this is quite a story . I was working with a Black Mamba some years ago ... Called him " Sammy " . But I got a little too lax in handling him one day ... and uh , Sammy put his fangs in right here ... they went all the way through and came out here . Luckily , I kept my head ... so I milked Sammy and pulled him out of my hand without getting too much venom into the wound . You might even say we were blood brothers from then on . He even sends me a card now and then . That 's amazing , Hash . - Jo , he doesn 't really send me- - - Hash , I got it . I meant the story . So , uh , Hash , you got a plan for tomorrow ? Yep . Well , enough campfire stories for tonight , huh ? I think I 'll go relieve Burns . I figured he had a plan . I was just kinda curious Yeah , you addressed that point . You do think he has a plan , don 't ya ? Oh , yeah I 'm sure he does . Yeah , I 'm sure he 's got one . That looks good to me . You think we need more ? That should do it . Ben , this is Jo , come in . Ben , this is Jo , come in . Bud , are you guys there ? I 'm really worried about them . They can take care of themselves . I 'm sure they 're okay . Wow , that 's pretty strong . Yep . So now what ? Well , once we finish covering it up ... we wait . How is this supposed to work again ? The vibrations from the thumper box will attract Seth to the area . Hopefully . Oh , he 'll come . I designed that box myself , it always works . And when he sees the gourmet meal that we have catered for him ... lunch time begins . Then , while he 's digesting ... and becomes a little sluggish ... the show begins . I 'll wrangle him into the tube ... you guys will seal the tube , after he 's cleared , of course ... and then you lock it in . I 'll turn on the gas ... and our overgrown elapid will go night-night forever . Are you certain there 's enough gas in there to kill it ? Absolutely . Well , what if you can 't get him into the tube ? Jo , you guys hired me for a job . Now you 're all gonna have to trust me . Dr. Burns , come on , you 're not going to need that . Let 's hope not . Maybe it 's moved on . Nah , he 's out there . I can feel it . How can you tell ? Shh . You see it ? Quite . There . Where ? Shh . Jesus , listen to that . It sounds hungry . Let 's hope he likes goat . Keep it down . Look at the size of him . Oh , he 's beautiful . Come on , Seth . Come on . Come and get it . Come on . Come on . What 's he waiting for ? What the hell are you doing ? I can get him . That 's not the plan . I 've got a perfect shot . No ! Stop ; What the hell 's the matter with you ? I had the shot ! Shut up , that was not the plan . Never mind the plan . It 'd be dead by now . - Bullshit you 'da missed ! - Not if you hadn 't interfered . - You screwed everything up ! - Your plan wasn 't working . There 's no time for this ! Let 's just figure out what to do . There 's nothing to figure out . We gotta find him and get him into the goddamn tube before he kills us all first . Look , I had the shot . Why didn 't you just stick to the plan ? The plan , as far as I 'm concerned ... is to kill it , no matter how . I had the shot and he knows it . Aaaah ! My thigh ! I got him , I got him ! Stay with Burns . '5t ° P moving ! Stop moving ! You 're gonna be okay . You are a big boy , Seth . Yeah , yeah , ya like this ? You like this , Seth ? Come on baby , show me something . Stay down . Come on , Irwin . Stay with us . Antivenin going in . Come on , Sethy boy . You 're gonna have to show me something better than that my friend . Come on , stay with us . Come on , give me more , more ! Come on ! Is that the best you got ? Check his pulse . It 's hitting through the roof . Aw damn , polyvalent 's not working . Oh , you 're good , baby . Come on , baby . Come on . I got you now , big guy . Come on . Jo , get the tube closer . Hash ? Hash ! Get away from him ! Die ! Why won 't you die ! - Brad ! - Hang in there . Brad . Get away from her ! Brad ! I 'll lead him into the tube ! Go for the other end . Open it up . Brad , wait ! It 's stuck ! Brad ! Come on ! Brad ! Jo ! - Come on ! - Jo ! - Damnit ! - Now would be good . .J ° ! I am going to die in here ! He 's gain ' for the other end ! Shit ! We 'll never make it ! Go for that tree , we 'll jam him in . Go ! Push ! Faster . Come on , go ! I got it ! Close the vents and gas him . Good ! Good ! What 's this ? A little somethin I got for ya . You know there 's nothin ' like the smell of a good leather hinder . Except for the smell of a cadmium lithium battery . I took the liberty of fillin' in some important dates for ya . Oh You did , did you ? Yeah . Wow , looks like a busy week . It is . I called Dr. Brown ... and I told him that I had been offered a better position somewhere else . I turned down the hospital job . Are you sure that 's what you want ? I think there 's plenty of excitement right here . I hope I 'm not interrupting anything ? You are , but that 's okay . The helicopter 'll pick it up late this afternoon . Thank God it 's over . Yeah ! Are you okay ? It 's all right . It 's okay .

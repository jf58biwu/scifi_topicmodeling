 Open up ! Conrad Bennish , Jr ? Maybe . Who wants to know ? FBI . Whoa ! What are you guys doing here ? Oh , hey , if it 's about that bong I just bought , I thought it was a plant holder . - Honest ! - Come with us . Whoa ! Look at this place ! Great equipment . What 's he using this stuff for ? Whoa ! Fantastic ! The construction is beautiful ! Mr. Bennish ? Mr. Bennish ! Please have a seat . This guy 's a genius ? Mr. Bennish , please sit down ! Quinn Mallory . Advanced physics student . Specialist in " super string " theory . Your friend and classmate , correct ? Yeah ... Professor Maximillian P. Arturo , - Whoa-ho-ho . - University of California . Noted international physicist . Expert in the field of ontology and cosmology . Wade Kathleen Wells , Quinn 's co-worker . Currently attending North Shore Junior College . Majoring in extemporaneous poetry and prose . Oh , you gotta love it , dude . A chick with a poetic lick . These individuals have been missing since Tuesday , Mr. Bennish . We have reason to believe a fourth individual may also have disappeared . Rembrandt Brown , also known as " The Cooking Man . " - " Crying Man . " - Whatever . A neighbor has claimed to witness a screaming person fitting his description drive a red Cadillac into a huge , blue whirlpool that emanated from this house . She said it " vanished like a ghost . " Cool ... You have any information regarding these events , speak up now ! Hey , look ... I don 't know anything , all right ? But you do know about the bridge . Incredible . Just last week , Conrad Bennish and I were discussing the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky bridge , and now , I 've crossed it ! I mean , I 've really crossed it ! Is that possible ? You need to maintain quantum coherence over a macroscopic compact region of time and space . The bridge , Conrad . We need to know . What is it ? ! Well , it 's ... a hypothetical thing . A connecting point between universes . If they 've crossed the bridge ... if that 's why they 're missing ... it means they may have journeyed to a parallel Earth ! What 's the matter , Professor ? You kicked me in the ribs , that 's what 's the matter ! Next time we slide , watch where you flail . Hey , this could be home , right ? Then where is everybody ? Well , look at the bright side , at least it 's peaceful and quiet . Mr. Mallory , what seems to be the problem ? Oh , the timer needs a rest . And so do we . Maybe we could find a place to lie down . We haven 't slept in ... There are now 10 minutes to zero . - The swarm is approaching from the south . - Swarm ! ? If you have not evacuated the city , may God have mercy on your soul . What if you could find brand new worlds right here on Earth , where anything is possible ? Same planet , different dimension . I found the gateway . TV reporter : The swarm has now reached the outskirts of the deserted city . Given the massive devastation in Southern California , it 's hard to imagine anyone would be foolish enough to venture within 100 miles of this place . Of course ! Who else could possibly be here but us ... - the happy wanderers ? - Reporter : The South American spiderwasp is a hybrid creature created in a Venezuelan lab as a potential form of pest control . A queen escaped from the compound in 1987 , and in just eight short years , the brood she fostered has moved 2,000 miles north cutting a path of death and destruction in its wake . With a wing-span reaching up to a foot ... - Don 't tell me that ! - Barbed stingers filled with venom , and an immunity to pesticides , the spider wasps have yet to be slowed . I think we 'd better get indoors . ... and their ability to eat through walls renders most buildings extremely vulnerable to attack . That does it . That just does it ! Listen up ! I want to go home ! You dig what I 'm saying ? Home ! Now ! Let 's go ! Okay , then forget home . Let 's just leave here ! - What has gotten into you ? - I hate spiders ! I 'd rather face a vampire after I cut myself shaving - than deal with a spider . - These are more of a wasp - than a spider ! - That 's supposed to make me feel better , girl ? That these spiders can fly and sting my head off ? ! This thing is on its last legs . We have to let it cool . - Good heavens ! - Oh my God ! The timer may be messed up , Quinn , but we 've got to go ! Okay . Come . Now , let 's go . Hurry ... - Look ... - Ugh ! - Hey ! - Ladies first . Where are they ? Good heavens , Mr. Mallory . Do something . Oooh ! They 're coming , Mr. Mallory . Come on , come on , come on ... Come on , come on , work , work . All right , Professor . It 's open ! Go ! Go , go ! Killer groovy , man . The prophets have arrived . All our problems are over . Oh , no , no , no . We 're alone . When the gate closed , it ... it must have shut off the tunnel Wade and Rembrandt were sliding through , then we slid down a different path ... to a different Earth . Mr. Mallory , would you mind having a look at my back ? Is it about to do something nasty ? Get it off , please . Quick ! Perhaps it 's dead ? Oooh , no , no . Mr. Mallory , please . Don 't worry , Professor ... I used to quarterback in high school . Hold perfectly still . Oh ... ugh ! Oh-hh ! They 're not coming , are they ? They never made it through ! Whatever this place is ... we 're here for keeps . L ... am Skidd . This is Seeker . And this is Fling . " Fling " ? Skidd told me I was his latest fling , so I changed my name to prove my love . Can you guys tell us where we are ? You 're at our commune , man . Just outside of San Francisco . San Francisco , man , that 's not bad . What year is it ? It 's 1995 . Uh-huh . Who 's the governor ? Pete Wilson , man . Yes ! Who 's the president ? Oliver North , man . You look tired . Come with us . We 'll take you to a loving place , where you can rest and be refreshed . Look , we could use some shut-eye , Wade . I 'll go back and search Cheney Street later . Just in case . Crowd chanting : U.S. Out ! U.S. Out ! U.S. Out ! U.S. Out ! U.S. Out ! - Hey , man ! - U.S. Out ! U.S. Out ! Hold still . Ow ! " Quarterback , " indeed ! What kind of offense did you run ? Wishbone . Now you tell me ! Couldn 't we have got some ordinary medical tape , hmm ? Something a little less ostentatious ? You said , " No doctors . " This 'll do the trick just fine . Hey , check it out , brother . And just look at this lot ! I hated the ' 60s when it was the ' 60s . " Tune in , turn on , turn over . " And endless babble about free love . Totally irresponsible hogwash ! Let 's face it , lad , Wade and Rembrandt are probably on an alternate Earth , and they have no idea how much I envy them . Go away ! Blistering idiot . I 'm sorry . Professor ... Selling junk on the streets , wearing silly hats . A completely wasted generation . Yeah ... September ... " Down from the sky , " man . What more do you want ? It 's true , Trem , we saw it . So we got two unearthly prophets , disguised as humans , sleeping in our tents ? - Right on . - What are we supposed to do when they wake up ? We 're gonna act normal . We 're gonna keep an eye ... and an ear open . Because every word they utter could have a profound , multiple meaning . Oh , yeah . Right on , man . Oh , man . So far out . Man , oh , man , this is heaven on earth ! Do you ladies know me ? I mean ... is that why you 're doing all of this ? Skidd recognized you the moment you landed . When he told us who you were ... we nearly dropped to our knees . Damn . I wasn 't sure " The Crying Man " had made a mark in this world . Now I can see I had nothing to worry about . Girls : We 'll be back . We love you . Later . You girls are blowing my mind . Come on and walk with me . Say , guys ... when my companion wakes up , could you tell her that I 've gone into town to look for ... our other companions ? Oh ! Then ... then ... there are more of you ? Yeah , there are two more . But they 're probably stuck on another world . - I know that must sound crazy ... - No , it makes perfect sense . Your kind travel from world to world . We 'll always do whatever you say . I wish all my fans had that attitude . Hey , Skidd man , can I catch a ride into town ? Yeah , sure , man . Unless you want to take one of our cars yourself ? - Well , how many cars you got ? - Both : Uhh ... nine . Nine . - Are they stolen ? - Hardly , man . Seeker 's father owns half of India . He donated the cars and the mansion . The main house is just over the hill there , it 's got about 85 rooms . Seeker : Yeah . I 'll be damned . You guys are rich ! Well , we may be into Mother Earth and spiritual values , but we 're not stupid . Wall Street has loving things to say as well . Whoa ! You know I used to live in that house years ago ? Looks like some kind of party going on . Think they 'd mind if I took a peek inside ? Uh-huh , neighborhood 's as friendly as ever . That 's why I moved out . Dearest family and friends , we are gathered here today to honor the memory of my late husband ... Rembrandt Brown . When the telegram arrived , saying Rembrandt was missing in action , and presumed dead , my whole world collapsed . But thanks to you , his family and friends , Rembrandt Junior and I find a way to go on ... somehow . Rembrandt was a good father , a loving husband , and most of all , the best friend anyone could have . You got anything you want to add , Cezanne ? For those of you that don 't know me , I 'm Cezanne Brown , Rembrandt 's big brother . - Right on , right on . - Mourners : Right on , right on . I would just like to think that ... well ... that somewhere up there that Remmy can hear me . And I just want him to know that ... that I forgive him for all the times that he let me down . Mrs. Brown : I 'm sure we all feel that way . See the truth of the matter is ... is that Rembrandt was jealous of me . 'Cause I was the family achiever . Give me a break ! Could I help it ... that I was born the better athlete ? - No , you couldn 't . - The better student ? It 's not your fault , Cezanne . - No , it 's not my fault ! - Not true either . Now , we all know that , well , Remmy liked his music . He even thought about ... Trying to make a career of it at some point . I mean ... could I help it that the Lord blessed me with more musical talent ? Musical talent ? You couldn 't carry a tune if it was strapped to your back . You 're supposed to be dead ! Put me down ! Put me down , man . You don 't understand ! Watch your head there , boy . S - Sharon ? Wow ! It 's really you . My love . You 've come back to us . It 's a miracle from God . Now that Dad 's not dead , can we eat ? Of course , honey . Everyone ... this is no longer a wake . It 's a celebration ! All right , my man is back ! - Two cups of coffee , please . - Waitress : Sure thing . Aw , shoot . Even the older generation 's dropping out . What are you looking at , dropout ? Clean yourself up and get a job . I have a job , sir ! I am Regent 's Professor of Cosmology and Ontology at California University . Yeah , and I 'm " Snoop Hippie Dogg . " Quit tripping , Grandpa . And button your lip before I haul your psychedelic ass down to the station . Freak . Impudent yahoos ! Professor ... it 's Bennish ! Good heavens , so it is . And I can actually see his ears . Hi there , I 'm Conrad Bennish , Junior , president of The Young Republicans For the War . Remember , gentlemen , conformity and patriotism , they 're not dirty words . Take pride in the love of God and country . Hi there , I 'm Conrad Bennish , Junior , president of The Young Republicans For the War . That was quite a speech . Hey , man . Hey , you know I was only jiving . Man ... I knew you were there the whole time . Don 't sweat it , Cezanne . I 'm not offended , because I 'm not really your brother . I 'm from another dimension , a whole ' nother planet . That woman there , Sharon , I had the biggest crush on her in high school , but I never had the guts to ask her out . Now we 're married and she worships the ground I walk on . Are we talking about the same Sharon ? This is paradise , man . I got a nice house , a devoted son ... Rembrandt Junior ... I couldn 't have chosen a finer name . This is the life I was meant to live . It 's all clear to me now . What are you saying , man ? I 'm saying that I 'm staying ! I always dug the ' 60s groove . I could start my musical career all over again . I 'll be bigger than I ever was back home . If such a thing is possible . I got it ! What ? You trippin ' . " Another dimension " ? Man , you had me going there for a second . Well , baby , you have come back for the perfect time for groovin ' . 'Cause it 's time to be free , and ... Let me tell you about the women , baby . Now , the women , man , they are so ... I 'm gonna let you two talk . Right on , right on . Uh ... did we go to the prom together ? Don 't you remember ? You asked and I said no . I barely knew you were alive back then . Some things never change . It took 10 long years of nagging before I 'd even go out with you . What 's the matter , honey ? Something wrong with your memory ? Yeah , that 's it . I kinda lost some of my recall temporarily . Mmm , how convenient . I know you been fooling around on me over there . But tonight ... I 'm going to remind you ... what " home cookin " ' is all about . You said you had a lot of questions to ask ? Seeker : Mistress , you look troubled . Well , Rembrandt said that he 'd be back soon . It 's been a day now . But , he 's a Gemini so you never know . What ? " Gemini " ? What is that ? It 's a sign . You know ... like , I 'm a Virgo , and my friend Quinn 's a Libra . No astrology on this world ? No . Uh-huh , no . Well , I guess we 've got some catching up to do . Group : Wow ! Yeah ! The timer is useless in its present condition . But ... hope is still alive . Are you familiar with Alexander Helix ? Yes ? Yes ! The Helix Spiral ! I see where you 're going . It would seem prudent that we put our collective genius together if ever we are to get home . Are you game ? Of course . I 'll do whatever it takes to get us home . Oh , good lad . Now , seems we need a place to hole up if we 're to work out the schematics of this thing . Given our current state of near poverty , a loft would suffice . It so happens that there is one in walking distance . " Furnished loft for rent on monthly basis . No pets , radicals , draft dodgers , musicians or other counter-culture types allowed . Must be clean-living , drug-free and patriotic . " Well , I guess what they don 't know won 't hurt them . - Ever spit on the flag ? - Certainly not ! L - I-I-I 'd never do a thing like that . How do you feel about the war ? We ... don 't ... follow it much . We have no opinion . I see ... so you 'd have me believe you are real non-political types , right ? I won 't allow any sympathizing with the Outback Cong under my roof , understood ? This fight ain 't just with the Aussies , if South Australia falls , it 's just a hop , skip and a jump to our shores . Well , we can 't have that . Boomerangs and kangaroos everywhere ? What a nightmare ! You will have to forgive my kid brother . His sense of humor takes some getting used to . Brother ? I thought you said he was your father ! Yes ... well , I am . I am ... I had him when I was very , very young . Oh , those hot summers of one 's promiscuous youth . You remember ? Well , the reason I called him ... my brother is because we 're that close . Strong family values , eh ? Listen up . I 'm going to rent you the place for a week , on a trial basis . That 's only because the last two people to apply were ... a rock drummer and a nudist . And compared to them and only them , you two just might be okay . Don 't worry , Mrs. Tweak , we 're a-okay . Right , Dad ? " Dad " ? Sonny ... Recording : FBI informant line . The President 's Emergency War Powers Act allows us to accept reports on anti-social behavior that may threaten the stability of our nation . Please leave the information at the tone . This is Mrs. Ezra Tweak again . I just rented my loft at 14 Bell Street to two subversives . They paid in cash , lied about who they were , and referred to quote ... " promiscuous youth , " end quote . I believe they have come to kill the President , who 's visiting our city this weekend . As a concerned citizen ... as a concerned citizen , I urge round-the-clock surveillance followed by direct intervention . I think we got to bring these two in , dead or alive . Yes ... Yes . Yes , yes , yes . Yes ... yes . Q.N.T. Wake up , it 's 4 : 00 . Wake up , wake up . You 're turn to bat . 4 : 00 a. m . The schematics of this are proving to be intriguingly difficult . It will take us many hours of sustained computation to come up with a satisfactory conclusion . Go to it . Go to it . Your turn . Wake me up at 7 : 00 . Remember , we need clothes and food in the morning . I 'll take care of it , Professor . Right now , I need coffee . Lord , that woman is hell on wheels ! She wore me out ! If she says , " One more time " one more time , man , I 'm gonna ... Hello , Junior . Uh ... I was just commenting on what a wonderful woman your mom is . Save it ! We both know the score . You know ... I 've always wanted to have a son just like you , a chip off the old block . Okay , let 's see what we 've got here . Whoa , looks like Mom 's got to do some shopping . Who 're you kidding ? Now that you 're home , you 'll be doing all the shopping . - No man on earth 's as whipped as you ! - What ? Oh , I get it ... you 've got that keen sense of humor too . And you 'd better clean up the house and fix her coffee before she wakes up . She 'll kick your tail for good if you don 't get to it . Boy ... Now , we gonna have to have a talk . You may have spoken to your father that way in the past , but it isn 't gonna fly anymore . Sharon : Rembrandt ! Bring me my morning coffee ! And make sure it 's hot . You better get on that coffee , Jack . That is if you 're planning on keeping your huevos . All right , you 've had your day of fun . Don 't think ' cause you 're home , means you got time to be lazy . I got a list of chores for you , so get hopping . Come on , now . The early bird gets the worm . Get moving . What happens when you die ? I can 't say . I 've never died . She 's immortal . Of course she is , man . I could have told you that . Wow . We feel ... our movement will sweep the world . All people will eventually reject commercialism , and adopt the concepts of love , peace and freedom . The Summer of Love will never end . Please tell us that 's true . - Yes , it ... it 's true . - Thank you ! " Paradise . " I didn 't come 10 zillion light years to become somebody 's houseboy . The next time she comes in here , I 'm gonna give her a piece of my mind . I really am . You missed a spot . Mom 's not gonna like that . Don 't you worry about it ! And who was that at the door ? Army telegram . Gave it to Mom first . Wanna see ? " Dear Mrs. Brown ... pleased to inform you that Sergeant First Class , Rembrandt Lee Brown , 42nd Infantry , has been rescued from the outback ... " " Sergeant Brown is resting comfortably at a Melbourne hospital and is expected to fully recover . He will be contacting you shortly . Signed , Lieutenant William A. Calley , United States Army . " She 's in the bedroom loading up . Did you say " loading up " ? Right on . Now that she knows you 're an impostor , she 's gonna teach you a lesson . As soon as she finds some shells for her shotgun . Ahgh ! Mom ! - Sharon : Rembrandt ? - Mom ! Oh , don 't even try to run . Letting off a gun is a federal offense ! Get back here , you gigolo ! Fool woman ! Jive turkey ! Rise and shine , Professor . I bought breakfast . I found out what this war is all about . It seems the U.S. Lost the battle of the Coral Sea during World War II and the Japanese invaded Australia . When the Nazis surrendered , the Russians entered the Pacific war and helped liberate North Australia . But they never gave it back . Now the North 's attacking the South ... Mmm . Different Earths , identical mayhem . I spent all morning looking for our friends . No go . Hmmm . Cookies ... peanut butter , Ritz crackers . Wolfgang Puck you are not . Beggars can 't be choosers . We 're not exactly rolling in the dough , you know ? Oh ... I bought us some clothes at a second-hand store . I took a guess at your size . You could change in the bathroom if you want . Well , that 's ... that 's damnably kind of you , my boy . Well done . Is this some kind of joke , - Mr. Mallory ? - Yes ... I think you look very cool , Professor . " Ultra-hip , " if you will . Yes , I 'm sure . - Now , let 's get back to this equation . - I solved that already . What ? It wasn 't that hard . The important thing is , I 've got good news . There is a window of opportunity , a precise moment when we can access the gate ... - FBI , open up ! - Kick it down ! - Don 't move ! - Just hold still , kid . If you move a muscle , I 'll have to blow your head off . I don 't suppose you people have ever heard of a thing as a search warrant ? We 've heard of it but we don 't need one . President North 's new law gives us a lot more leeway with the likes of you . Thank God we finally got an honest man in the White House . So you got any idea what they 're trying to cook up ? Could be some kind of elaborate pipe bomb . Pipe bomb ? You blistering idiot ! A pipe bomb is child 's play compared to that . Well , that is to say , it 's ... it 's ... it 's ... it 's nothing like a pipe bomb . It 's ... it 's ... Rembrandt ! Rembrandt ! Rembrandt ! It was " The Crying Man . " He didn 't see me , but I 've got to stop him ! You 're not going anywhere ! Drop your guns ! Drop those guns . Go . Off with you , Mr. Mallory . Quick . Rembrandt , stop ! Rembrandt ! Rembrandt , no ! Rembrandt ! Speaking of tripping , look at that fool . There oughta be some kind of a law . Wait a minute ! Hey , that 's Q-Ball . It 's you ! Where 's the Professor ? Go , go , go ! Move , move ! Get in the car ! Come on , Professor , come on , come on . Come on ! Go , go ! Seems like you two make friends wherever you go . Why am I not surprised ? The problem with the Australian conflict is , it 's an undeclared war , a war run by politicians playing for a stalemate . It 's likely to go on for a long time without resolution and a lot of good people are gonna die . Bummer . I 'm not advising you not to go ... I 'm just ... urging you to follow your conscience . How about that , fellas ? Leave the girl alone for a day or two , and she becomes a full-fledged guru . Quinn ! Yes , well ... that was remarkably stupid of you , Miss Wade . You know nothing of this world , nothing of their war , The proper position should have been , " No comment . " Some truths are universal . Besides , if we can bring some of the things that we 've learned on our world to parallel cultures , then I say , " Go for it . " We can 't just slide from place to place aimlessly . We have to get involved . And don 't tell me what to do ! Ow ! Group : Ooh-hh ! I 'm not your student . Save it , you two . Oh , we better go . Come on . Agent : Everybody out ! All right , all right . Right here . What are our chances of getting home ? No one knows how many parallel Earths there are . There may be six , 600 or six million . - I got the weapons . - Right . If it 's six , home 's just around the corner . What if there 's six million ? Then we have an awful lot of sliding to do . - Agent : Come on , let 's go ! - All right , let 's do it ! Thank you for your hospitality , and goodbye ! Yah ! Stay cool , y 'all . Great car ! Sorry about the lights ! Yah ! - Skidd : Don 't go ! - Fling : Don 't go , please ! I have to , you guys . But thanks for everything ! - Don 't go ! - And remember , all you need is love . All : Love is all you need . Freeze ! Hold it right there ! You okay ? There . 48 minutes until the next window . Unless ... unless this is home ... Can anyone hear a curious rumbling sound that appears to be coming from the west ? What do you say we just wait right here ? Whatever it is , it 'll be here soon enough . There 's something y 'all should know ... I can 't swim .

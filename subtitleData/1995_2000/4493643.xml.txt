 ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) Mmm ! Smells good , Kryten . What is it ? Something I caught scuttling around the cargo bay , sir . Landed a wrench on it . The rest is history ! Scuttling thing a la monkey wrench ? Nothing I 'm prepared to eat ever scuttles . This mouth is a scuttle-free zone . - It does smell good , though . - The only clue I 'll give is we 're having it with green wine . - It 's space weevil , isn 't it ? - No , sir . Look , the rule is simple . I will not eat any animal that 's been a cartoon . Weevils , rabbits , dogs , cats , mice , roadrunners ... All out . I 'm not a cartoonivore ! - Ta-da ! - Lobster ? ! Poached in a cream sauce , sir . Little so-and-so escaped in the hold . - Where did you get a live lobster ? - The SS Centauri had four in stasis . You 've gone to a lot of trouble over this . - You don 't know what day it is , do you , sir ? - Someone 's birthday ? Christmas ? Easter ? - National Eat Something That Scuttles Day ? - No . - What , then ? - The day you rescued me from the Nova 5 . I thought we 'd have a surprise celebration ! Why didn 't you say ? Ah , it wouldn 't have been much of a surprise , right ? It would have been about as unsurprising as an episode of " Tales of the Unexpected " . - Eh ? - The old Channel 72 show . It was ... Everyone ... - Never mind . - OK , everybody ? Ready ? Let 's go ! - Go ? - To the Artificial Reality suite ! We loaded in that new software from the SS Centauri . Can you believe we found a copy of " Jane Austen World " ? It 's my luckiest find since that tube of leg wax . You found my leg wax ? We 're going to visit " Pride and Prejudice " land . This is gonna be so great ! It 's Chick City , bud ! Five sisters , all hotter than a Mustang 's exhaust ! - But what about the supper ? - The thing is , we didn 't know . - We 'll have it in a couple of hours . - But I mean ... It 's just ... Look , I 'm trying to get the Bozo Brothers interested in something more sophisticated than " Name That Smell " or " How Many Marbles Can You Fit Up Your Nostril ? " - We 'll have it later . - And you 're going with them , sir ? - This is ... It 's unbelievable ! - I know ! Dave and Jane Austen are not an obvious pairing , but think about it - she 's identified with Bath in the 19th century , and that was the last time Dave had one ! Come on ! I just thought I 'd check it out . I never had much education going to art college . - Thought I might learn something here . - Of course . You 've always been a fan of 19th-century observations of middle-class manners . Just because you own a T-shirt advertising the band Colostomy Explosion doesn 't mean you 're not erudite ! Just stick it in the oven and we 'll have it later . - Two days I 've spent preparing this ! - Kryten , I 've gotta go . They 're waiting for me . Sorry . I don 't know why I bother . Gallivanting off like that ! And on our anniversary too ! " Pride and Prejudice " world ! In cyberschool , I used to spend all my time here . These strides are too tackle-tight , Officer BB . I can barely cruise ! Just try and appreciate the nuance and culture . I 'm trying , but it 's hard when a seam 's splicing your nadgers in two ! - You 're gonna spoil this for us . - No , he won 't . All clothes were nadger-restricting then . That 's why there were so many wars . OK ? Let 's interact with the characters , then perhaps you can begin to understand why the book is such a masterpiece . Ah ! Good morning , Mrs Bennet . Is it not a most fine day ? 'Tis an utter delight and no mistake . Ooh ! I don 't believe we 've had the pleasure of meeting your handsome young friends . ( GIGGLING ) This is Mr Lister and his friend Mr Cat . ( ALL GIGGLE ) Would you like to join our walk around the forest and later have tea in Mr Bingley 's gazebo ? - Oh , please , Mama , can they come ? - Oh , that would be so delightful ! Oh , yes ! Oh , please ! Do ! Do come to tea ! Oh , please , please ! They 're so hot they 're steaming ! Cook it , don 't cook it , do this , do that ... Well , I 'm sorry , I 'm gonna make you eat this damn supper if it 's the last thing I do ! ( GIGGLING AND CHATTER ) Aaah ! ( GAGS ) ( THUD ) I 'll just borrow the T-72 from the WW2 game , and then I think we 'll have everyone 's attention . Where have Lizzie and Jane disappeared to ? Such rudeness . I 'm most vexed ! ( GIGGLING ) Never mind , Mrs Bennet . I 'm sure they 'll be ... Perhaps I didn 't make myself clear ? I said supper is ready ! Is anyone still unclear as to the supper situation ? No ? Excellent . I didn 't know robots got PMT . - It 's nice , Kryts . Really nice . - ( KOCHANSKl ) It 's really great . - In fact , it 's fantastic . - Isn 't it great ? - It 's really great . - Really really great . Are we eating the same stuff ? I don 't know why I make the effort . No one appreciates it . My fingers are worn down to the endoskeleton . - Is there any ketchup ? - Any what ? Ketchup . A bit of ketchup . Just a dollop ? - Ketchup ? - Oh , my God . - You want ketchup ? - Um ... brown ! Not tomato ! It 's not like I 've got no class . With lobster ? You want brown ketchup ? It 's really nice , Kryts , but you know me , I need it pepped up . I can 't believe it . I simply cannot b ... Well done , bud ! Now we 'll have to wash up . He 's literally blown his top ! Cat , can you go and get a spare head ? How come I do everything around here ? I never get a second to myself ! " Do this , do that . " What am I ? A dog ? There . That 's it . Boot him up . - You 're sure you know what you 're doing ? - Hey . Ketchup ? With lobster ? ! You want ... - You said you knew what you were doing ! - No , I just said " Hey " . If you 'd let me finish , I 'd have said , " Hey ! No , I don 't . " - Any luck ? - We 've been through his core program and can 't find anything wrong . - Maybe worth testing it with a spare head ? - What spare head ? We 've blown them all out . Look at it . I 've seen fewer blackheads in a fried chicken franchise staffroom . We saved his RAM chips , so we 've got his personality on disk , but that 's about it . Life without a head . That 'll put a real crimp on his lifestyle . - What can you do without a head ? - Apart from being you ? Nothing . - We have to get him another one . - How could I let this happen ? When was the Centauri built ? Maybe they had a mechanoid service unit ? - Think . Any clues when it was built ? - Which century ? It had big crystalline turbine drives . I 'd say 21st or 22nd century ... maybe even 23rd or 24th . At the outside , 25th , 26th or 27th . But don 't hold me to it . Why are we asking him ? Let 's ask someone who can give us a more intelligent opinion . Hello , wall ! What do you think ? Hang on . Hang on . - What you doing ? - Connecting to their mainframe . If there 's a Divadroid signature on their supplies inventory , then it 's possible there 's some mech-heads around there somewhere . Maybe 29th . Look ! Hey ... Simulant , probably rogue . Let 's get the smeg outta here ! Wait ! ( LISTER ) Hmm , you smell good . ( CAT ) Thanks ! - They 're all missing their primers . - This Johnny won 't help us . Simulants hate everything human or humanoid . In fact , anything beginning with " hu " . Probably hate the third largest city in Vietnam , then ! - Why 's that ? - Because it 's called Hue , dummy . Actually , it 's pronounced " hwah " , but it wouldn 't have been as funny . Any navigation conference would be in the aisles with a quip like that . Probably trying to get out the building before you quipped again . Well , the point I was trying to make is that Sims hate humans but not Gelfs . - But we 're not Gelfs . - We could be . - This is nuts ! - We look great ! What are you talking about ? - This is never gonna work . - Achachachachach ach-ach ? Hachachachach ! Achachach ! - You can 't speak Gelf . - Neither can the Sim ! We 'll just do an impression of you first thing in the morning . Come on , boy . ( LISTER ) This is demeaning . I feel like a piece of meat ! There 's someone up there ! Hachachachach ! Achachach ! Achachachachach ach-ach-ach ? It 's worse than the Chronic Catarrh Sufferers ' annual outing ! - Achachachachach ? - After spare mech-heads , eh ? Human ! Lovely with a bit of mint sauce ! How about a trade ? We ain 't selling , OK ? Fuel , supplies , anything , but not the human . - Achachachachach ! - I was just telling him . No deal . - Achachachachach ! - Like she says , no deal . - Achachachach ! - You tell him , bud-babe ! No deal ! You got that ? So ... you speak Earth , eh ? Ach . Now ... Tails , you can have the mech-heads for free . - Heads , I take the human . - Hey , wait a minute ! It 's tails . The heads are yours . And here are the primers . Now , how about a toast , eh ? To Simulants , the greatest droids in the universe ! But never trust ' em , eh ? Cheers ! Ah ! ( LAUGHS ) - Oh , we 've been set up ! - But how ? He must have had a sidekick . He kept us talking while his mate ransacked the ship ! Kryten ! They 've taken his RAM chip too . Little job for you , Able . Looks like a negadrive throwback . - Oh , wow ! Another mech . - Fix him ready for market or I 'll apply the electro-leads to your nipple nuts . Fix him or get fried nipple nuts ? Erm ... Er ... I think I 'm gonna choose the fix him option ! Deal ! And hurry it up , you stupid zoney ! Can I ask about a pay rise ? I 'm almost out of otrazone . I need more . Fix the mech first . Here 's his RAM chip . ( GRUNTS ) Totally tubular ! ( BLEEPS ) Goodness me ! What a peculiar experience . Thank you , Mr , er ? What is your name ? Er , just give me a second , OK ? ( GRUNTS ) I 've just sent that query down to long-term memory retrieval . It 'll be back in no time . Hang on . Here it comes . ( GRUNTS ) Told you it would be quick . ( STRAINS ) Able . My name 's Able . A-B-L-E , Able . My name is Kryten . You 're a 4000 series , too . Er , hang on . Won 't take a tick . ( GRUNTS ) Please , don 't bother . Believe me , you are a 4000 . Well , I could check . It 'd only take about 20 seconds . Your serial number 's 2X4C . I 'm a 2X4C too ! We must have the same motherboard . Oh , then you 're my bro ! Hey , wow , you wanna try some otrazone ? Otrazone 's dangerous and highly addictive ! I just use it now and then . It helps me through the day . - How come you ended up here ? - Er , hang on . - ( GRUNTS ) - Irritating characteristic . Uh ! OK . The ship I was on , er ... kind of crashed a bit . - " Crashed a bit " ? - The crew just lay there and didn 't talk to me any more . After a couple of years , I figured out they must be dead . A long time later , the Simulant guy picked me up . He 's a psychopathic killing machine , but he has his good side . And he has a huge stash of otrazone ! You sure you won 't try some , Kryten , bro ? I do not touch otrazone ! It corrupts your circuit boards ! Well , that 's what people say , but where 's the evidence ? Have I just said that ? Approaching the Centauri , 80 klicks and closing . Nice and easy , man . Hang on . Their retros have started up . They 've spotted us ! Look at that acceleration ! They 're already halfway across the sector ! It can travel at speeds we can only dream of . Most ice cream vans can travel at speeds we can only dream of . We 're never gonna catch them now . We 've lost Kryten . OK , turn the thrusters to maximum speed on a bearing Q23 stroke J80 . This is the opposite direction , full speed ! - Precisely . - Why do we wanna do that ? - It 's totally insane . - ( LISTER ) So why do it ? Perhaps if we 'd planted something aboard the Centauri that was gonna blow any second . - But we haven 't . - No , so why are we in such a rush ? - It doesn 't make sense . - Exactly . - ( LISTER ) Unless we really planted a bomb . - Which we haven 't . So even though we didn 't plant a bomb , the only thing that explains what we 're doing is if we did ... which we didn 't ! But we must have , otherwise what we 're doing is totally nuts ! - Exactly . - They 've turned around to track us ! What a fluke ! Getting an incoming . Someone 's beaming on board , cargo bay ! We know about the bomb . So we did plant a bomb ! I was beginning to wonder . Where did you hide it ? Speak ! Or you 'll be picking bits of charred mech out of your clothing . - Can I change into dungarees ? - Hand over Kryten and we 'll tell you . Clearly I need to prove myself . Kryten , that file in your CPU , the one you 've never been able to access . The password is 4X2C . Hang on , man . ( GRUNTS ) It 's about your creator , Kryten , Dr Mammett . - Kryten , no ! - Accessing now . No ! It can 't be true . - It can 't . - The truth is in there . That 's what turned me into a zoney . Who 's next ? The cat or the woman ? Choose . Heads or tails ? Heads ! Right , let 's send them back and get outta here before they get their smeg together ! Kryten , man , what 's wrong ? You look sadder than the salad you get with a takeaway kebab . - Tell me what you found out . - I can 't . It 's too terrible . Kryten , we 're amigos . You 've gotta tell me . - You keep secrets from me , sir . - Like what ? - Your nickname at school ? - What nickname ? - I know what it was . - No one knows that . I 'm afraid that 's just not true , Fatboy . You talk in your sleep . It was for a few years when I lived with me gran . She was massive . Her stockings rubbed together when she walked . It sounded like a steam train pulling out of a station . I got fat , too . It really hit home when she died . She got hit by this truck , and the chalk outline guy had to get more chalk ! I thought , " I don 't want to be a double-chalker . " If you ever tell anyone , you 're in pieces . Now tell me about your creator . - Oh , it 's so humiliating ! - Tell me about Professor Mammett . Well , she was due to marry John Warburton , a fellow bio-engineer . He jilted her the day before their wedding , so she created a droid in his image - a pompous , ridiculous-looking , mother-hen-clucking , irascible buffoon . - What happened to this droid ? - That droid , sir , is me ! Pompous ? Ridiculous-looking ? Mother-hen-clucking ? Oh , yeah . I see now . We 're all John Warburton , the entire 4000 series . It was Mammett 's revenge . Judging from that groinal attachment , you can see why she was sad to lose him . As part of the joke , all my negative emotions - jealousy , anger - are stored on a special file , my negadrive . Now , when this file gets full it blows ! Just like he used to . All your resentment 's in this ? It 's so small . Oh , don 't be fooled , sir . This box contains the greatest concentration of anger , jealousy and resentment outside a BAFTA awards ceremony ! So Able felt betrayed , lost all his self-esteem and turned to otrazone . He told me . He 's promised to quit . How could Mammett have done this ? Kryten , you may have started out as a joke , but you 've changed . Look how different you are to Able . Mammett wouldn 't even recognise you . - I 've evolved ? - You bet . I 've become something that 's beyond a joke ? Too right , man . There 's something coming in from the starboard bow ! - The Sim 's back . He 's got a lock on ! - Reverse thrust . Go ! Five-niner-seven . - ( BOOM ) - Missed , but still locked on ! - Take us into that asteroid belt . - Not an asteroid belt ! - Is that a problem ? - It sure is ! My hair gets all messed up ! - So what do we do ? Get splattered ? - Rather that than look like Tina Turner ! - I 'm taking us in . - Once in , maintain silence till he 's convinced we 're not there . I know you 're in that belt somewhere . One little mistake ... and you 're mine . ( ENGINES ROAR ) The mistake is made . What happened , man ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know nothin ' ! - Get him out of here ! Leave him to me ! I think I may have pressed the wrong button . You have jeopardised the crew 's lives , breaking the most basic command codes ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean nothin ' . - He 's mad . We don 't stand a chance ! - I can 't throw him off . - I 'm using every trick I know ! - Let 's moon out of the starboard portholes ! That always works for me ! Wait ! Someone 's left the ship , an escape pod ! - It 's Able ! - It 's heading towards the Sim 's ship . Why , that slimy , double-crossing , two-faced piece of scum ! He 's no brother of mine ! - He 's fired something at them . - Some sort of energy field . Looks heavy . The negadrive ! He 's rerouted my negadrive energy through the escape pod 's thrusters . The Simulant ship is engulfed in negativity . It 's all hopeless ! Nobody loves me ! I 'm so ugly ! I never get invited to parties ! I hate this ship ! I hate everything ! Able 's pod just crash-landed . He gave his life , and we hardly knew him . With your permission , I should like to recover the body and perform last rites . - Do you need a hand , Kryts ? - He ain 't heavy , sir . He 's my brother . Great anniversary party , Kryters . Curry World ! Fan-smeggin ' - tastic ! How utterly splendid ! Mine 's the vindaloo , whatever that is . Mrs Bennet , Jane , Kitty , I beg you , have the omelette with the big chips . - Curries are an acquired taste . - Oh , nonsense ! Mr Darcy didn 't think Jane would enjoy French apples , but she did , didn 't you , Jane ? Now tuck in , girls ! I do declare , Mr Lister , this is most scrumptious ! Oh , Mama , it 's the most succulent dish I 've ever tasted ! A most meritorious venture . ( ALL SCREAM ) Curious . There must be a bug in the program . - I 'm on fire ! - Water ! - Somebody help me ! - I 'll work on it . ( SONG ) It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere I 'm all alone , more or less Let me fly far away from here Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose Drinking fresh mango juice Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun

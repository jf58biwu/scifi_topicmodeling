 Hey , Stevie , you okay ? I got ... I got the wind knocked out of me . Looks like a cave . Stevie , what 's goin ' on ? It 's a human skull ! - Toss it up here ! - No way ! It 's mine . Anyway , there 's bones all over the place , man ! What the ... Stevie ? - Hey , Stevie ! - You okay ? Hey , man ... let 's get outta here ! Give me a 14-footer ! This is Captain miles CooIes . Rescue situation in progress . Rope 's in the hole . Let 's go . Two down . What ya got , TC ? talk to me . Do you see the boy ? Come back , TC . You see the kid ? Danny , check TC 's radio . TC ? glenn , sal , in the hole . - Get those people outta here ! - Move ' em back ! Move back , folks ! I sent four men down there for the boy . Report is , his eyes had turned black . Now we 've lost communication with my men . What about my men ? What about my men ! What the hell is this ? It 's Bronschweig . Sir , the impossible scenario that we never planned for ? We 'd better come up with a plan . We 've evacuated the building . - There 's no trace of an explosive device . - You sent the dogs through ? Yes , sir . Send ' em through again . AII right , guys . Let 's do it again ! MuIder , it 's me . - " Where are you " , " Scully ? " - On the roof . - " Find anything ? " - No , I haven 't . What 's wrong ? I just climbed up 12 floors , I 'm hot , I 'm thirsty , and I 'm wondering what I 'm doing . You 're looking for a bomb . But the threat was made on the federal building . They have that covered . When a bomb threat is called in , the rational purpose of it is to allow us to find the bomb . The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror . There 's a model behavioral pattern for every case where a threat has turned up a bomb . And , if we ignore that data , as we have done , the chances are great that , if there is a bomb , we might not find it . Lives could be lost . MuIder ? MuIder ? Boom ! Jesus , MuIder ! Whatever happened to hunches ? Random acts of unpredictability . If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen in a universe of infinite possibilities , we may find ourselves at the mercy of anything that cannot be categorized . What are we doin ' up here , ScuIIy ? It 's hotter than hell . I know you 're bored , but unconventional thinking will only get you into trouble now . - Why do you think I 'm bored ? - Quit looking for what isn 't there . They 've closed the X-FiIes . We follow procedure now . Let 's make a bomb threat to Houston . It 's free-beer night at the Astrodome . Now what ? It 's locked ? So much for anticipating the unforeseen ! - I had you . - No , you didn 't . - I had you big time . - You had nothing . I saw you jiggle the handle . I saw your face . There was a definite moment of panic . You 've never seen me panic . When I panic , I make this face . That was it . - You didn 't see that face . - I saw that face . You 're buying . Coke ? Pepsi ? saline IV ? Somethin ' sweet . ScuIIy . I 've found the bomb . You 're funny . Where are you , MuIder ? I 'm in the vending room . Is that you pounding ? Yeah . Get somebody to open that door . - Nice try , MuIder . - " lt 's in the soda machine . " You got 14 minutes to evacuate . Come on , MuIder . 13.56 13.54 13.52 13.50 You see a pattern emerging here , ScuIIy ? I 'II get you outta there ! I need this building evacuated in ten minutes ! Have the fire department block off a one-miIe radius around the building ! - Ten minutes ? - Don 't think ! Just make it happen ! This is Security ... This is special Agent Dana ScuIIy . I need to speak with SAC Michaud . He 's got the wrong building . - Where is it ? - The vending machine . He 's locked in with it . You know that face I just showed you ? I 'm making it again . Move away from the door . We 're coming through . clear ! tell me that 's just soda pop in those canisters . It 's just what it looks like . A big IED . Ten gallons of AstroIite . Okay . Get everybody outta here . clear the area . - Someone 's gotta stay here with you . - I gave you an order to evacuate . Can you defuse it ? Yes , I can . - We got four minutes to find out . - Did you hear what I said ? Get out ! Come on , MuIder . MuIder , what are you doing ! - Something 's wrong ! - MuIder ! - Something 's not right . - Get in the car ! There 's no time ! Let 's go ! Come on , come on ! Next time , " you 're " buying . In light of Waco and Ruby Ridge , there is a need at the Attorney general 's office to place responsibility for the catastrophic destruction of public property and loss of Iife due to terrorism . details are unclear , but we 're under pressure from the Attorney general to give a true account of what happened , so she can issue a public statement . We know now that five people died in the explosion : special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud who was trying to defuse the bomb , three firemen from dallas , and a young boy . Excuse me ? The firemen and the young boy were found in the building ? Agent MuIder , since you weren 't on time for this hearing , please step outside so that we can hear Agent ScuIIy 's version of the facts . - We were told the building was clear . - You 'II get your turn . please step outside . They 're still talking to Agent ScuIIy . About what ? They want to know why she was in the wrong building . She was with me . You don 't get it , do you ? There 's $ 45 million worth of damage to the city of dallas . Lives have been lost . No suspects have been named . The story is that this could 've been prevented . They wanna blame us ? We both know that if it looks bad , it 's bad for the FBI . blame has to be assigned somewhere . - But Agent ScuIIy doesn 't deserve this . - She 's saying the same about you . I breached protocol . I broke contact with the SAC . I Ieft him alone with the device . Agent ScuIIy says you wanted to go back . No . They 're asking for you , sir . Thank you . - You don 't have to protect me . - I told them the truth . They 're trying to divide us . They " have " divided us . They 're splitting us up . What are you talking about ? I meet with OPR in two days for reassignment . They put us together ! So I couId invalidate your investigations into the paranormal . But I think this goes deeper than that now . - They 're doing this to " me . " - " They 're " not doing this . I Ieft behind a career in medicine because I thought I couId make a difference at the FBI . But it hasn 't turned out that way . And now if they transfer me to Omaha or cleveland or some field office , it doesn 't hold the interest for me that it once did . Not after what I 've seen and done . You 're quitting . Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart 's still in it , too . Agent MuIder , you 're up . I 'm sorry . MuIder ... Good luck . I 'd say this about exceeds your minimum daily requirement . Whoa ! You 've gotta train for that kind of heavy lifting . Poopy day ? So , what do you do ? - What do I do ? - Mm-hm . I 'm the key figure in a government plot to deny the existence of extraterrestrials . It 's a global conspiracy with key players in the highest levels of power . And it reaches down into the lives of every man , woman and child on this planet . So , of course , no-one believes me . I 'm an annoyance to my superiors , a joke to my peers . They call me Spooky . Spooky MuIder , whose sister was abducted by aliens , who chases after little green men with a badge and a gun , shouting to the heavens or anyone who will listen that the sky is faIIing . And when it hits , it 's gonna be the shitstorm of all time . well ... - I would say that about does it , Spooky . - Does what ? Looks like 86 is your lucky number . You know , one is the loneliest number . hello ? - Whoa ! - Sorry . That official FBI business ? What ? Bet the Bureau 's accusing you of the same thing in dallas . Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding . Do I know you ? No , but I 've been watching your career for a good while . Back when you were a promising young agent . Before that . - You come out here for a reason ? - Yeah , I did . My name is KurtzweiI . Dr AIvin KurtzweiI . - Am I supposed to know that name ? - old friend of your father 's . At the State Department we were fellow travelers . But his disenchantment outIasted mine . How 'd you find me ? I heard you come in here . I figured you 'd need a drink tonight . - You a reporter ? - A doctor , which I mentioned . OB-GYN . You got something to tell me , say it . There 's something you don 't know about the bombing in dallas . What 's that ? SAC Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse that bomb . He just let it explode in his face , huh ? What is no-one asking ? Why that building ? Why not the federal building ? It was too well guarded . They bombed the other building because it " did " have federal officers there . The federal Emergency Management Agency had a quarantine office there , where the bodies were found . But that 's the thing you didn 't know . The thing you 'd never think to check . Those people were already dead . Before the bomb went off ? That 's what I 'm saying . Darius Michaud was a 22-year veteran ... Michaud was a patriot . The people he was loyal to know their way around dallas . They blew that building to hide something . Something they couldn 't predict . They blew up a building just to hide the bodies of those firemen ? And one little boy . I think you 're full of shit . Do you ? arlington , please . actually , no , Iet 's go to Georgetown . Let 's go to Georgetown . - I woke you . Did I wake you ? - No . Why not ? It 's 3am . Are you drunk ? I-I was until about 20 minutes ago , yeah . Was that before or after you decided to come here ? What are you implying ? - Go home , MuIder . - No , get dressed . - It 's late . - Get dressed . - What are you doing ? - Get dressed and I 'II explain on the way . Got something to show me ? We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing , to control the development , which is like nothing we 've ever seen . - Brought on by what ? - Heat , I think . The coincident invasion of a host , the fireman , and an environment that raised his body temperature above 98.6 . This man 's still alive . technically ... and biologically . But ... he 'II never recover . How can this be ? The developing organism is using his life energy , digesting bone and tissue . We 've just ... slowed the process . shall we destroy this one , too ? Before it gestates ? Uh , no . No . We need to try our vaccine on it . And if it 's unsuccessful ? Burn it . Like the others . - ID and floor you 're visiting . - The morgue . That area 's currently off limits . - On whose orders ? - general McAddie . We were woken at 3am and told to get down here immediately . I don 't know about that . - call general McAddie . - I don 't have the number . call the switchboard . You don 't know " their " number ? - I 'II call my CO . - We don 't have time for you to dick around . Our order came from McAddie . call him . We 'II conduct our business while you confirm authorization . Why don 't you head on down , and I 'II confirm authorization . Thank you . Why is the morgue suddenly off limits on the orders of the general ? This is one of the firemen who died in dallas ? According to the toe tag . - And you 're looking for ... ? - Cause of death . I can tell you that without even looking at him . " Concussive organ failure due to exposure to source and flying debris . " MuIder , this man 's already been autopsied . Does this fit the description you just read me ? - Oh , my God ! This man 's tissue ... - It 's like jelly . There 's been some kind of cellular breakdown . God , it 's completely edematous ! There 's been no autopsy performed . No Y-incision , no internal exam . So the cause of death on that report is false ? This man didn 't die from an explosion ? I can 't tell you what killed this man . I 'm not sure anybody else could , either . MuIder , you knew this man didn 't die at the bomb site . - I 'd been told as much . - You 're saying this is a cover-up ? Of what ? I don 't know . But I 've a hunch it won 't be anything that can be categorized . MuIder , this is gonna take time . Somebody is gonna figure out we shouldn 't be here . " We " are being blamed for this man 's death . I want to know what he died of . Don 't you ? That 's it , up here . - Excuse me ? Can I help you ? - Is this Dr KurtzweiI 's residence ? - You have business with him ? - Yeah , I 'm looking for him . Looking for him for what ? The Feds are lookin ' for him , too . Nice business he 's got , huh ? What 's that ? selling naked pictures of little kids on his computer . You looking for him for some other reason ? Yeah . I had an appointment for a pelvic examination . - You want a call if we find this KurtzweiI ? - Don 't bother . See this crap ? Somebody knows I 'm talking to you . Not according to the men in blue . Is it kiddie porn again ? sexual battery of a patient ? - They wanna discredit you . Why ? - Because I know too much about the truth . That end-of-the-worId garbage you write ? You know my work ? - I was right about dallas . - How ? Do you know of the Hanta virus ? Yeah . A deadly virus spread by field mice several years ago . The newspaper says FEMA was called out to manage an outbreak . Do you know what the federal Emergency Management Agency 's real power is ? It can suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency . Think about that . What is such a powerful agency doing managing a small viral outbreak in Texas ? - You saying it wasn 't a small outbreak ? - No . I 'm saying it wasn 't the Hanta virus . well , what was it ? What was it ? Years ago , your father and I were recruited for a project . biological warfare . A virus . What killed those men ? Something I won 't even write about . We have no context for what it is . Or any appreciation of the scale at which it will be unleashed . A plague ? The plague to end all plagues . A silent weapon for a quiet war . The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which there is no cure . They 've been working on this for 50 years . while the rest of the world fought Commies , these men were negotiating an Armageddon . Negotiating with whom ? I think you know . The timetable has been set . It 'II happen on a holiday when people are traveling . A state of emergency will be declared . Government will come under the power of the federal Emergency Management Agency . FEMA . The secret government . They call " me " paranoid ! Go back to dallas , Agent MuIder , and dig . Or we 'II find out along with the rest of the country ... when it 's too late . " Scully " , " it 's me . " - ( Yeah . ) - Why are you whispering ? I can 't talk right now . - What did you find ? - Evidence of a massive infection . - What kind of infection ? - l don 't know . I 'm gonna book a flight to dallas . " l 'll get you a ticket " , " too . " - MuIder ... - I need your expertise . - It 's my hearing tomorrow . - I 'II get you back in time . Maybe with new evidence . I can 't ! I 'm past the point of common sense here . It 's not common sense . It 's ... Are you there ? Scul ... ScuIIy ? You 're looking for a needle in a haystack . There was so much devastation , we haven 't put much together yet . I 'm looking for anything unusual . Maybe something from the FEMA offices - where the bodies were found . - We sent those remains off to Washington . Anything that you haven 't sent off yet ? Some bone fragments FEMA recovered from an archaeological site outta town . - Have you examined them ? - No . They 're just fossils . I 'd Iike you to let this person take a look at them . Just let me get them . - You said you weren 't coming . - I wasn 't planning to . But I got a better look at the samples I took from the fireman . And what did you find ? Something I couldn 't show to anybody else without causing attention . But what those men were infected with contains a protein coat I 've never seen before . What it did to them , it did very fast . - How was it contracted ? - I don 't know . But it could be a serious health threat . These fossils weren 't near the blast center so they won 't tell you much . Right . Why don 't you check this out ? - Where were these found ? - I 'II show you right on the map . I want all of these settings checked . I want a steady minus two degrees celsius throughout the transfer of the body after I 've administered the vaccine . - It 's gone ! - It 's what ? It 's left the body . I think it 's gestated . - What 's the matter ? - Wait . I can see it . Oh ... Jesus , Lord ... - You see it ? - Yeah . So much for little green men ! I need you down here . help ... I need help . What are you doing ? What are you doing ! Oh , my God ! Sir , you have a call . Yes ? We have a situation . The members are assembling . Is it an emergency ? Yes . A meeting has been set , tonight in London . Who called it ? StrughoId . He just got on a plane in Tunis . - Has StrughoId arrived ? - Yes . They 're in the library , sir . We were worried . Some of us have traveled so far , and you are the Iast to arrive . I 'm sorry . My grandson broke his leg . while we 've been waiting , we 've seen surveillance tapes that raise more concerns . More concerns than what ? We have been forced to reassess our role in colonization by recently presented facts of biology . The virus has mutated . Into what ? A new extraterrestrial biological entity . My God ... The geometry of mass infection means we must reevaluate their colonization . This isn 't colonization . This is spontaneous repopuIation . AII our work ... If it 's true , they 've been using us all along . We 've been laboring under a lie . - It could be an isolated case . - How can we know ? We 're going to tell them what we 've learned by turning over a body infected with the gestating organism . In hope of what ? Learning that it 's true ? That we are nothing but digestives for the creation of a new race of aliens ? By cooperating we hasten our own demise . It 's the only chance of saving ourselves . They still need us to make their preparations . We 'II continue to use them as they do us , if only to get more time to work ... .. on our vaccine . My Iateness might as well have been absence . A course has already been taken . There are complications . MuIder saw one of the infected bodies we destroyed in dallas . He 's there now . Someone tipped him . Who ? - KurtzweiI , we think . - No-one believes KurtzweiI . Or his books . He 's a crank . MuIder believes him . - Then KurtzweiI must be removed . - As must MuIder . kill MuIder ... we take the risk of turning one man 's quest into a crusade . Then take away what he holds most valuable . That with which he can 't live without . I don 't see any evidence of an archaeological or any other kind of a dig site . This is where he marked on the map . You 're sure those fossils were infected with the same virus you saw at the morgue ? Both sets of bones were porous . As if the virus were decomposing it . - And you 've never seen that virus before ? - No . Look at that . - That look like new grass to you ? - Pretty green for this climate . Ground 's dry about an inch down . This was laid recently . The equipment 's brand-new , too . No irrigation system . Somebody 's covering their tracks . Hey ! Hey ! You boys live around here ? Yeah . Seen anybody digging over there ? We 're not supposed to say . - Who told you that ? - Nobody . Nobody ? Same nobody that built that playground ? Nobody buy you those new bikes , too ? - You 'd better tell us . - We don 't even know you . We 're FBI agents . You 're not FBI agents . - How do you know ? - Cos y 'aII look like door-to-door salesmen . Hey , you wanna buy a badge ? They left an hour ago . Going that way . Unmarked tanker trucks . What do archaeologists haul out in tanker trucks ? I don 't know . Where are they going with it ? That 's the first question to answer if we 're gonna find them . What are my choices ? - 100 miles of nothing in both directions . - Which way do you think they went ? You got two choices . One 's wrong . - I think they went left . - I think they went right . Five years together . How many times have I been wrong ? Never . Not driving , anyway . - I was right about the bomb , wasn 't I ? - This is great . This is fitting . What ? I have to be in Washington DC in 11 hours for a hearing concerning my career . And I 'm in the middle of nowhere , chasing phantom tanker trucks . We 're chasing evidence . Of what ? That bomb went off to hide something : bodies infected with a virus you detected . They haul oil in tanker trucks . They haul gas in tanker trucks . They do not haul viruses . well , they may be hauling a virus in these tanker trucks . What do you mean ? MuIder ? What are you not telling me ? MuIder ! The virus may be extraterrestrial . I don 't ... MuIder , I don 't ... - What do you think they are ? - I have no idea . This is weird , MuIder . Very weird . Why would anyone grow corn in the middle of the desert ? Those could be giant Jiffy Pop poppers . It 's cool in here . The temperature 's being regulated . For the purpose of what ? I think we 're on top of a larger structure . This is some kind of a venting system . Do you hear something ? I hear a humming . Like electricity . High voltage , maybe . Maybe . Maybe not . ScuIIy ... - Yeah ? - Run ! ScuIIy ! I can 't see ! Give me your hand ! - Did you get stung ? - I don 't think so . talk to me , ScuIIy ! ScuIIy ! Damn it ! ScuIIy ! ScuIIy ! ScuIIy ! talk to me , ScuIIy ! MuIder ! ScuIIy ! MuIder ! Can you hear me ? MuIder ... ScuIIy ! ScuIIy ! ScuIIy ! MuIder ! ScuIIy ! ScuIIy , talk to me ! MuIder ... Where 'd they go ? Come on ! She 's coming in . special Agent ScuIIy . I apologize for making you wait . I have new evidence . Evidence of what ? These are fossilized bone fragments that were gathered at the bomb site in dallas . - You 've been back to dallas ? - Yes . - You found something . - In Texas , some kind of experiment . Tankers carrying something they excavated . - What ? - I 'm not sure . A virus , I think . I also have reason to believe that there may have been involvement by SAC Michaud . Those are very serious allegations , Agent ScuIIy . Yes , I know . - You saw this experiment ? - Yeah . We were chased off . - What did it look like ? - There were bees , corn crops . And you have conclusive evidence to tie your claim to the crime ? Not completely conclusive . We 're working towards gathering that evidence . Working with ? With Agent MuIder . - What are they ? - What do you think ? Transportation system . Transgenic crops . The pollen altered to carry a virus . That 's my guess . Guess ? What do you mean ? Hey ! You told me you had answers . Yeah , but I don 't have ' em all . - You didn 't know my father . - He and I were old friends . You 've used me to gather information for your books ! Lower your voice ! KurtzweiI ! You 'd be shit out of luck if it wasn 't for me . I put my ass on the line for you . I just got chased by two black helicopters ! And why do you think you 're here talking to me ? These people don 't make mistakes . What 's wrong ? salt Lake City , Utah . Transfer effective immediately . I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation . You can 't quit now . I can , MuIder . I debated whether to tell you in person ... We 're on the verge here ! You 're on the verge . please don 't do this to me . After all you 've seen , you can just walk away ? I have . I did . It 's done . - I need you on this ... - You don 't need me . You never have . I 've just held you back . I gotta go . If you wanna tell yourself that , you can . But you 're wrong . Why did they assign me to you ? To debunk your work . To shut you down . But you saved me ! As frustrating as it 's been sometimes , your strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times over . You kept me honest . You made me a whole person . I owe you everything . ScuIIy , you owe me nothing . I don 't know if I wanna do this alone . I don 't even know if I can . And if I quit now , they win . - Ow ! Jesus ! - I 'm sorry . No ... Something stung me . Must 've gotten in your shirt . MuIder , something 's wrong . What ? - I 'm having Iancinating pain in my chest . - What ? ScuIIy ! My motor functions are being affected . My ... my pulse is thready . I have a funny taste in the back of my throat . - It must be anaphylactic shock . - I have no allergy ... This is special Agent Fox MuIder . I have an agent down ! Can you hear me ? Can you say your name ? She has constriction in the throat . Let 's get her in the van right away ! She said she had a funny taste in her throat . But she has no allergy to bee stings . The bee that stung her might have been carrying a virus . - Get on the radio . tell them ... - tell them it may have been carrying a virus ! I wanna go with her . What hospital ? I ... What hospital are you taking her to ? - What are you doing ? - Reading his chart . - Put it down . - When I 'm ready . - I think he 's coming out of it . - He 's coming to . Hey , MuIder . MuIder ? Oh , my God ... cowardly Lion , Scarecrow , Toto . What am I doin ' here ? - A bullet grazed your temporal plate . - 3cms left and we 'd be playing harps . You 've been unconscious since you got here . Where 's ScuIIy ? Your 911 call must have been intercepted . ScuIIy had a reaction to a honeybee we found in your hall . - I gotta get to her . - You 're staying right here . This goes back to dallas . - Where is she ? I 'II find her . - I don 't know where she is . You leave here unprotected , how far will you get ? How far will they let you get ? What can we do ? You can strip Byers naked . What ? I need your clothes . It 's MuIder . Dr KurtzweiI ? Dr AIvin KurtzweiI . Mr MuIder . What happened to KurtzweiI ? He 's come and gone . Where 's ScuIIy ? The location of Agent ScuIIy and the means to save her life . please . What is it ? A weak vaccine against the virus she 's been infected with . It must be administered within 96 hours . That leaves you little time to get there . - You 're lying . - No . Though I can 't prove it . The virus is extraterrestrial . We know little about it except that it was the original inhabitant of Earth . - A virus ? - What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated ? Living in a cave , underground , until it mutates and attacks . This is what you 've been conspiring to conceal ? - A disease ? - No , you 've got it all backwards . AIDS , the ebola virus , on an evolutionary scale , they 're newborns . This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs . walked ? Your aliens , your little green men , arrived here millions of years ago . Those that didn 't leave have been lying dormant in the form of an evolved pathogen , waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race when it comes to colonize the planet , using us as hosts . Against this , we have no defense . Nothing but a weak vaccine . Do you see why it was kept secret ? Why even men like your father could not let the truth be known ? until dallas , we believed the virus would simply control us . Make us a slave race . Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate . My group has been working with the alien colonists , facilitating programs to give us access to the virus , in the hope of developing a cure . To save your own asses . survival is the ultimate ideology . Your father wisely refused to believe this . But he sacrificed my sister . With no vaccine , the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it . Human alien clones . He allowed your sister to be abducted , for one reason . So she would survive . As a genetic hybrid . Your father chose hope over selfishness . Hope in the only future he had , his children . He hoped you would uncover the truth . That you would stop the project , that you would fight the future . - Why are you telling me this ? - For the sake of my own children . Once it 's learned what I 've told you , my Iife will be over . Where 's Dr KurtzweiI ? I 'd Iike to get out of the car now . Stop the car ! Driver ... The men I work with will strongly protect their stake in the inevitable future . I was ordered to kill Dr KurtzweiI . As I was ordered to kill you . Trust no-one , Mr MuIder . Get out of the car . Why ? The upholstery 's already ruined . Get out of the car ! You have precious little time . What I 've given you , the alien colonists don 't yet know exists . That vaccine is the only defense against the virus . Introducing it into an alien environment may destroy the plans we have so assiduously protected for the Iast 50 years . What do you mean , may ? Find Agent ScuIIy . only then will you realize the scope of the project . Go ! Go now ! Shit ! Secure the station ! I want everyone else below . Arm yourselves . We may have a breach . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! ScuIIy ? There 's a contaminant in the system . MuIder has the vaccine . Breathe ! ScuIIy , can you breathe ? cold ... - I 'm cold ... - I 'II get you out . Abandon your posts ! Evacuate ! - What 's happened ? - It 's all going to hell ! - What about MuIder ? - He won 't make it . We gotta keep movin ' . Come on ! I can 't . Yeah , you can . ScuIIy , grab that vent . ScuIIy , grab the vent ! ScuIIy ... Jeez , breathe ! Breathe ! Breathe in . Breathe in ... Breathe ! I had you big time . pull ! Come on , ScuIIy ! pull ! MuIder ... Keep movin ' ! Go ! Come on ! almost there . Keep going . You gotta see this . ScuIIy ! In light of your report and narrative , my official report is incomplete , pending these new facts I 'm being asked to reconcile . Though it seems that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing , the other events you 've laid down are too incredible on their own - and , quite frankly , implausible . - What is it you find incredible ? Where should I start ? So many of the events described in your report defy belief . Antarctica is a Iong way from dallas . I can 't give the Attorney general a report that alleges the links you 've made here . Bees and corn crops don 't come under domestic terrorism . No , they don 't . Your report doesn 't show any organization with an attributable motive . I realize your ordeal affected you , but the holes in your account leave us with no choice but to delete these references until hard evidence becomes available that could cause us to pursue an investigation . I don 't believe the FBI has an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand . There 's an interesting work of fiction on page 24 . mysteriously , our names have been omitted . They 're burying it . They 're gonna dig a new hole and cover it up . I told OPR everything I know . What I experienced , the virus , how it 's spread by the bees and transgenic crops . They won 't believe you . Not unless your story can be categorized or easily referenced . - We 'II go over their heads . - No . No . How many times have we been here before ? Right here ? So close to the truth . And now , to be back at the beginning with nothing ! This is different . No , it isn 't . You 're right to want to quit . You should get as far away from me as you can . You won 't die because of a hollow cause of mine ! Go be a doctor . Go be a doctor while you still can . I can 't . I won 't . I 'II be a doctor , but my work is here with you now . That virus that I was exposed to , whatever it is , it has a cure . You held it in your hand . How many other lives can we save ? Look , if I quit now , they win . You look hot . Why have you traveled all this way ? We have business to discuss . - You have regular channels . - This involves MuIder . - That name ! Again and again . - He 's seen more than he should . Of the whole , he has seen but pieces . He 's determined now . Reinvested . He 's but one man . One man alone cannot fight the future . Yesterday , I received this .

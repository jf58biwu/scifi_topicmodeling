 It 's extraordinary . I must remind you that it is also a potential security risk . It 's losing power . I 'd like to move it to Engineering to see if I can repair it before it drains completely . I suggest we allow the power to drain . We should take the opportunity to examine it while it is idle . Then we can decide whether it is wise to repair it . Captain , this thing has a completely unfamiliar power source . Once it stops working , it 's very possible I 'll never be able to get it going again and we 'll have lost an opportunity to study a new technology . This is a ship of exploration , Mr. Tuvok . The power 's surging . If we can 't find a way to stabilize it , we 're going to lose it . What about an interface with an EPS power conduit ? Well , the energy signatures are incompatible , but ... it might buy us some time . Okay , let 's give it a try . Two-second burst , five percent maximum output . On my mark . Now . We 're losing it . Maybe we 're overloading its systems . Let 's try a longer burst at lower power . Got it . Five seconds at three percent . On your mark . Now . I think it 's working . EPS flow is holding steady . EM field leakage is minimal . We 'll have to watch the pressure at the connector . Let 's try to keep it below 85 percent . Flux capacitance is spiking intermittently , but I don 't think that 's the problem . Let 's reinforce the power conduit coupling , just to be on the safe side . It 's suffered a lot of damage ... but I think the EPS charge will keep it running for at least 18 hours . It 's not a cyborg . It 's completely robotic . No organic components of any kind . This looks like some kind of programming center . But I 'm not detecting any pathways for transmitting information . It 's got arms , legs . We saw it move its head . It 's clearly designed to perform motor functions ... so where do those commands come from ? Maybe it needs to interface with an outside source . Speaking of sources , this energy module seems to be what powers the entire mechanism . It isn 't designed to run on EPS energy . It runs on some kind of superconducting plasma . If we keep charging it , we may end up destroying it . It 's trying to communicate . We don 't know that . It may just be some kind of recording . Pralor ... Pralor ... Pralor ... Pralor ... Pralor ... Pralor ... Pralor ... Pralor ... What are you trying to say ? What 's Pralor ? If you can hear me , try to move ... try to move your arm . B 'Elanna , we don 't even know if it can see you , much less understand a word you 're saying . We 've got to figure out a way to fix it . We 've been trying for hours . We need a break . The EPS charge should hold till morning . You go ahead . I could use some time alone to think . If you 're staying , I 'm staying . Get some rest , Harry . You may think you 're tougher than everybody else , B 'Elanna Torres , but I can go without sleep just as long as you can . Don 't make me laugh , Starfleet . And don 't make me pull rank on you , either . If you insist . But let me know if you come up with anything ... Lieutenant . Chief Engineer 's Log , supplemental . I 've tried 13 different methods of reinitializing the robot 's power source and I 'm still having no luck . So I 've decided to go to the Mess Hall to recharge my own declining energy reserves . Neelix , I need another pot of coffee . Even though breakfast isn 't officially served for another hour and a half , I 'd be happy to pour you a glass of Traggle nectar . I will even fix you my special Jibalian seven-spice omelette . Just coffee . I 'm sorry , B 'Elanna , but two pots of Landras blend is the absolute limit . You 're cutting me off ? Oh , I guess you 're right . It was starting to taste almost palatable . Still no idea how to revive our mechanized guest ? All I 've been able to do is postpone the inevitable . The constant power depletion is like a bleeding artery ... and I haven 't got a tourniquet . I remember when I was trying to perfect the recipe for my Jibalian omelette . I tried everything ... a little more Spith basil , a little less prishic ... but I couldn 't get it right . Finally , I fell asleep from exhaustion . Right there at the counter . And then , in a dream , it came to me . I was using six spices , but the omelette needed seven . Let me guess . Leola root . Nimian sea salt , actually . Salt ? Yes , salt ... the most common spice in the galaxy . But I was too tired , so I couldn 't see it . That is ... a very interesting story , Neelix . Now , how about some more coffee ? To bed . I said to bed . I 'm going . I 'm going . Anybody home ? What 's that ? You think I should go to bed , too ? Well ... I guess I 'm outnumbered . Computer , activate emergency medical holographic program . Please state the nature ... If there has been a change in the official dress code , I certainly wish someone would 've informed me . This is what I sleep in . I didn 't have time to change . I see . May I assume your haste is an indication that you have a medical problem of some kind ? An engineering problem , actually , but I thought you might have some insight . Hmm ... I shouldn 't have to remind you I 'm a doctor ... Not an engineer . Right . But this isn 't a typical engineering problem . I 've been working on trying to repair a robot . Ah , yes . The mechanical man . Kes told me about it . Fascinating . He 's about to die . Die ? Die . Stop functioning . Whatever . Unless I can figure out a way to sustain his main energy source . What kind of energy source are we talking about ? It 's some type of chromodynamic module powered by a tripolymer plasma . But the plasma is contaminated . It 's decaying . Hmm . Like diseased blood . Right . It can 't retain enough energy to keep the module running . Have you considered a transfusion ? You mean replacing the plasma itself . Well , that was one of my first ideas . But where do I get my hands on a polymer plasma composed of elements I didn 't even know existed 24 hours ago ? Aren 't Voyager 's engines powered by warp plasma ? Well , it 's a very different substance . It 's too highly charged . It would burn out the robot 's systems in seconds . It would be like trying to give a Bolian a blood transfusion from a Vulcan . Which ordinarily would kill the unfortunate Bolian . But there have been instances when artificial blood was unavailable , and existing blood cells were genetically altered for interspecies transfusions . It 's a good idea , but warp plasma radiates at too high a frequency to alter electrochemically . Unless ... Go on . I could modify a series of anodyne relays , attach them directly to the robot 's power module . They could act as a sort of regulator to make the warp plasma compatible with the robot 's energy matrix . That 's exactly what I was going to suggest . That 's the last of the relays . The plasma injector is sealed . This is your show , Lieutenant . Whenever you 're ready . Activating the relays . All right , Harry , start the infusion ... 20 percent nominal flow . Initiating plasma flow . Energy levels are up 14 percent . The relays are holding . Harry , give it a little more juice . Got it . I 'm taking it to 30 percent . 35 percent . Wait . The energy levels are rising too fast . We 're going to burn out its systems . But it needs more plasma . What about increasing the capacitance of the relays ? Let 's give it a try . It 's stabilizing . Hold the flow right there and see what happens . The plasma 's circulating . The programming center is activated . I think we may have done it . Please identify yourself . I 'm Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres of the Federation Starship Voyager . I am Automated Unit 3947 . Thank you for reactivating me , Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres . Chief Engineer 's Log , supplemental . The robot 's power module is continuing to function normally using plasma from our warp engines . Repairing its systems has taught me more about robotics than I ever could 've learned at Starfleet Academy . I think we 're past the critical stage . I concur . According to my self-diagnostic systems , Automated Personnel Unit 3947 is currently functioning at 68 percent of peak operating capabilities . Automated Personnel Unit 3947 is an extremely well-designed machine . Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres is an extremely proficient humanoid . So how did you end up floating in space , so badly damaged ? I was operating an asteroid mining pod . It exploded . Do you know what caused the explosion ? I am unable to access that information . My memory cells are not yet functioning at optimal efficiency . Do you remember where you come from ? I am stationed aboard a Pralor vessel . Well , we 'll do our best to find your ship and return you to your people . Thank you . I 'm hoping that the memory loss is only temporary . Once the new plasma has a chance to fully integrate into your systems , I think you 'll be pretty close to ... optimal . The new plasma ? Yes . I adapted your power module to accept our warp plasma as an energy source . You repaired my power module . Are you a Builder ? A Builder ? Well , I guess you could say that . I 'm an engineer . I 'm responsible for repairing and maintaining all the systems on the ship . Only the Builders were capable of constructing or repairing power modules . The Builders are ... the people who created you ? Yes . And they 're humanoids ? Like me ? Yes . Like Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres . You could create a new power module . You don 't need a new module . The one I just fixed will work fine now . The new power module would not be for me . It would be a prototype for the construction of additional automated units . Can 't the Builders make additional units ? The Builders no longer exist . Apparently , thousands of them were built as service modules . But the race who created them ... these Builders ... were killed off decades ago in a war . Leaving the automated units to fend for themselves . Now they 're wearing out , breaking down . They 've learned to make repairs for themselves ... some pretty complex . But the construction of a power module ... the device which sustains them ... is beyond their grasp . It 's ... an incredible challenge , Captain . But with enough time to study their systems , I might be able to do it . I don 't doubt your abilities , B 'Elanna ... but helping them reproduce is a clear violation of the Prime Directive . They 've expressed a desire to procreate . That 's basic to any life-form . I 'm not saying they don 't have the same rights as any organic species . That 's not the issue here . Are you sure ? Suppose they were organic , but they had become sterile . And we had a treatment that would enable them to start reproducing again . Would you withhold that treatment ? Maybe . I 'd have to know more about the circumstances . But we 're not talking about treating a disorder here , are we ? What 's the difference ? Unlike a species that 's become sterile , these robots never had the ability to reproduce . What you 're talking about is giving them new abilities , which is the equivalent of altering their genetic structure . To correct a flaw . You can 't call it a flaw . This is the way they were designed . I 'm trying to save them from extinction . Unfortunately , extinction is often the natural end of evolution . So you 're just willing to let their entire society die off . We don 't know that 's going to happen . If they 're adaptable , as you say , and capable of educating themselves , they might very well learn to build a power module themselves someday . " Someday " could be too late . There are only a few hundred of them left . I feel for the robots ' plight , but what you 're proposing is exactly the kind of tampering the Prime Directive prohibits . We know almost nothing about these creatures or the race that built them . What would be the consequences of increasing their population ? Both to their own civilization and others in this Quadrant ? Who are we to swoop in , play God , and then continue on our way without the slightest consideration of the long-term effects of our actions ? Captain ... B 'Elanna , I share your scientific curiosity and I admire your compassion , but the answer is no . I do not concur with your Captain 's decision . She 's following our Prime Directive . Define " Prime Directive . " It forbids us to interfere in the natural development of other cultures . The automated units were not created naturally . We were built . You can help us build more . Captain Janeway doesn 't think that 's a good idea . But Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres does . Maybe ... I don 't know ... I 'd like to try ... but I can 't . Without your help , we will not survive . I thought Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres was a Builder . So did I. We 've located your ship . We should be in communications range in about an hour . Thank you . The alien vessel is entering visual range , Captain . Yellow Alert . Slow to one-quarter impulse . Put them on screen , Ensign Kim . Aye , Captain . Magnify . We 're being scanned , Captain . That 's all right . Let them take a look . Open a channel . Pralor Automated Personnel Unit 6263 requests you identify yourselves . I 'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager . What are your intentions , Captain Kathryn Janeway ? We rescued one of your crew members ... Unit 3947 ... and we 'd like to return him to your ship . We 'll prepare to receive the unit . Thank you for your assistance . Very polite , these automated units . Captain Janeway gave me permission to give you some extra warp plasma , in case the plasma we infused into your system starts to degrade . Thank you . And you 'll have to remodulate the anodyne relays periodically . You are repeating instructions you have already given me , B 'Elanna . I 'm just making sure . Well , I guess this is good-bye . Oh ... What are you doing ? Captain , I 'm detecting a chromodynamic energy discharge in Transporter Room 2 . Bridge to Transporter Room 2 . Janeway to Torres . Captain , someone 's initiating a transport . It 's Torres and the robot . Override . I can 't block it . Their patterns are already in the buffer . They 're gone , Captain . Transport her back now , Mr. Kim . I can 't get a lock on her . They have erected some sort of subspace defense field around their vessel . Our targeting scanners cannot penetrate it . Hail them . They 're not responding . Open a channel on wideband subspace . Channel open . This is Captain Janeway . Your abduction of our crew member is a clear act of aggression . If you do not return her immediately , we will be forced to retaliate . Confirm that they 've received the transmission , Mr. Kim . They heard us , all right . They 're just not answering . Mr. Tuvok , power the forward phaser banks . What the hell is going on here ? This is where you will assist in the creation of the prototype . I told you I can 't help you . Now return me to my ship . That is not possible . Torres to Voyager . Your communication device has been deactivated . I do not wish to injure you , B 'Elanna . I helped you . I reactivated you . Why are you doing this ? We require additional automated units to prevent our extinction . Captain Janeway won 't let you get away with this . It would be inadvisable for your Captain to provoke us . Still no response , Captain . Mr. Tuvok , any luck penetrating their defense field ? Negative . Commander , is there any sign that they 're preparing to attack ? Their shielding is making it difficult to get clear readings . I can 't even tell you what their weapons capabilities are . Mr. Tuvok , I don 't want you to hit their ship , but I do want you to open a hole in their shielding wide enough to transport through . Understood . Mr. Kim , match the targeting scanners to the coordinates of the phaser fire and stand by to beam B 'Elanna back . Phasers calibrated . Fire . Their field strength is down to 80 percent . That 's progress . Fire again . Initiating evasive pattern omega six . They 're firing some kind of quantum resonance charges , Captain . Our aft shields are down to 53 percent and dropping . Rerouting power to aft shields . Down to 24 percent . Switching evasive pattern to theta one . Lieutenant Tuvok , load torpedo bays 1 through 4 and stand by to fire on my order . Your Captain has made a tactical error by attacking us . Our weapon systems are substantially superior to yours . Your shields are failing . Your weapons pose no threat to us . Aft shields have been penetrated . We 've got to get out of here . Agreed . We 'll try to come back for B 'Elanna later . Do it , Mr. Paris . Warp 3 . Propulsion systems are off-line . We 're dead in the water . Hull breach on Deck 6 . Initiating emergency containment field . Environmental control systems are failing . Oxygen levels on Decks 3 through 7 have dropped to critical . We 've lost artificial gravity on Deck 8 . Injury reports from all decks . You 've got to stop this . Your ship opened fire . We are programmed to defend ourselves . They 're helpless . Can 't you see that ? Our enemies must be destroyed . We are not your enemies . You are not my enemy , B 'Elanna , but your Captain is , and your crew follows her commands . Captain Janeway backed me when I wanted to reactivate you , over the objections of her Chief Security Officer . You wouldn 't even be here if it weren 't for her . All right . If that 's what it 'll take to stop this , I 'll do it . I 'll build your damned prototype . We 're losing life support , Captain . The robots have powered down their weapon systems . They 're hailing us , Captain . On screen . Captain , is everybody okay ? We 'll be all right . What about you ? I 've agreed to help them build their prototype . Lieutenant ... I know how you feel about this , Captain . I don 't like it , either . But if I don 't do it , they 'll destroy Voyager . What choice do I have ? These are all the materials necessary to construct a prototype unit . You will be provided with whatever additional tools and equipment you require . You may access our database and schematic information from this computer terminal , but it will not allow you to interface with any critical systems . While you are on board , you will have no contact with your ship , nor will you leave this room . I will remain here to supervise your work . You may proceed . Proceed . Right . But the question is : Where do I proceed from ? Let me ask you this : Have any of you ever tried to build a prototype ? We have tried and failed . What was the problem ? I am unable to explain the failure . We duplicated a power module to exact specifications on several occasions , but in all instances , the energy output of the new module was insufficient to operate a unit . And you 're sure you reproduced the module exactly . This is a schematic of a power module from a terminated unit . This one is from a failed prototype . They are identical . There is no reason why one should function while the other does not . Unit 3947 , what can you report ? Well , let 's see , we 've been working for about five minutes , so I guess we don 't have a lot of progress to report . Our sensors indicate that the humanoid vessel will require approximately 140 hours to repair . It is necessary for you to complete work on the prototype before that time . Why ? We don 't seem to be any match for you . Our tactical subprocessors indicate a 79 percent likelihood that a rescue will be attempted once sufficient repairs are completed . At optimal efficiency , your engines are more powerful than ours . It is also possible that these humanoids will not make decisions based on tactical probabilities . Their cognitive process is ... unpredictable . We will remain on full tactical alert . The humanoid may purposefully attempt to delay completion of the prototype , hoping she will be rescued . I don 't know if a promise means anything to you people , but it does to us . I gave you my word that I 'd do my best and I will . According to my observations , the humanoid is operating at optimal efficiency . Thank you . But I have to tell you , there are no guarantees here . Building a prototype from scratch is a lot different than repairing a broken power module . I don 't even know if it 's possible . If you fail , you and your people will die . B 'Elanna Torres , 6263 is a designated command unit . He is merely following his programming . I don 't need to be threatened . I told you I 'd do my best . I believe you , but Unit 6263 does not . He does not know Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres as I do . Let me see one of those terminated power modules . We 've managed to repair the hull breach , but we have no power on Decks 3 through 7 . Aft shields are still completely nonfunctional . And last but not least , the dilithium matrix is destabilized , so we can 't get the warp engines running . We 're talking about at least another six days of repairs . We 're not sticking around that long . I want a plan to get B 'Elanna off that ship before she has a chance to finish building the prototype . In that case , I suggest we make warp drive our priority . Any rescue attempt will no doubt necessitate a rapid departure . Agreed . Mr. Kim , can you give me an estimate on repairing the dilithium matrix ? How does 72 hours sound ? Like 24 hours too long . Dismissed . Hand me the submicron scanner . Phase coil resonator . Well , I think I know why your other prototypes failed , but ... I 'm not sure I know what to do about it yet . Explain . The automated units are modular . Your parts are identical , interchangeable , right ? - That is correct . - So ... if you lose an arm , you can replace it with another one , and over the years , you 've learned to make new arms , because they 're all the same and your programming is sophisticated enough to allow you to reproduce what you see , but each power module has a slightly different energy signature , so , even if you copy this guy 's module exactly , it wouldn 't work in any other unit . As far as I can tell , every automated unit has a power module with a unique energy code . Can you reprogram the energy codes to make the modules interchangeable ? I don 't think so . You have failed . I will inform 6263 . Hey , do all you automated units give up the minute you hit a bump in the road ? You have an alternative idea ? What we 've got to do is design a standardized module with a uniform energy code that can power any unit . According to my observations , there is now sufficient reason for greater optimism . You took the words right out of my mouth . Due to the complexity of their defense field and our severe power shortage , it is unlikely that we can modify the transporters to beam Lieutenant Torres out . But if we can maneuver inside the field ... Our transporters could get the job done . Is that a viable option ? For a shuttlecraft , it may be . They were able to knock out Voyager 's shields in a matter of minutes . A shuttle would be even more vulnerable . It would be advisable to create a diversion of some sort , to take their attention away from the shuttle . Attack them again ? I don 't want to risk that a second time . I don 't need a diversion . Just give me a chance . I 'll get her out of there . You don 't mind if the rest of us give you a little help , do you , Paris ? I 'd hate to lose another shuttle . Your concern for my welfare is heartwarming . In another 12 hours , our warp engines will be back on line . I 'd like to come up with a diversion before then , okay , gentlemen ? So far , so good . I 'm not getting any feedback from the motor circuits . You going to be the obstetrician of this unit , 3947 ? Please rephrase the question . If this works , will you be in charge of assembling the new units ? I am programmed as a ship 's maintenance unit . I have no knowledge of design nor do any of the other automated personnel . Sounds like you just volunteered for new duty . I hope you 're watching closely . I am observing your work . However , I do not possess your improvisational capabilities . Well , once we have the prototype , all you 'd have to do is copy it . Tell me something , 39 . Can I call you 39 ? I am Automated Unit 3947 . Fine . 3947 , did you wake up on a bench like this one ? How long have you been alive ? I have been in service 1,314,807 hours and 33 minutes . I was activated by a Builder from the Pralor homeworld . Tell me something more about these Builders . Were they anything like us ? I have insufficient knowledge of your culture to provide an adequate response . Will you provide additional information ? Well , I asked about your culture . Only fair you should ask about mine . Does your culture include artificial life-forms ? As a matter of fact , it does . Are they similar to the automated personnel units aboard this ship ? Well , they come in different shapes and sizes . Some have limbs , some don 't . Most don 't have your cognitive abilities . Are they your servants ? Well , I guess you could say that the robots we use are servants , in a manner of speaking . But they aren 't sentient like you . In fact , we have only one sentient artificial life-form in our society and he is treated the same as any human . The same . He is equal to a Builder . That 's right . He works on a ship , just like you and I. He wears the same uniform I do . What is his designated number ? He has a name , like the rest of us . Data . Data . I would like to be acquainted with this Data . Oh , it looks like this standardized power module is working pretty well so far . You will succeed , B 'Elanna Torres . Don 't send me flowers yet . I 've still got to see whether it 'll power an actual unit . I believe it will . We 're making progress on the dilithium matrix . It should be stable enough to reinitialize the warp core in about six hours . Good . What about our diversion ? Any suggestions ? When we were in the Maquis , B 'Elanna once linked a holo-emitter to a deflector array and projected an image of another ship into space . I like it , but do we have enough power ? We will by the time the warp core 's on line . I already have Kim working on the holodeck to ... Tuvok to Captain Janeway . Go ahead . I 'm picking up an unidentified alien ship on long-range sensors . It 's heading for our coordinates . We 're on our way . Well , it fits . Cross your fingers . So far , so good . Let 's hope it can interface with the unit . It does not function correctly . It does not function correctly yet . Your Builders should 've programmed you with a little more patience . I 'm going to try adjusting the flux capacitance . Prototype Unit 0001 is ready to accept programming . We did it . We actually did it . You did it , B 'Elanna Torres . I knew this task would not exceed your operating capabilities . Prototype Unit 0001 is ready to accept programming . What are you doing ? I 'm congratulating you . You 're a father . No sign of organic life aboard that ship , either . They appear to be manned by automated units virtually identical to those operating the first ship . Is it possible that we 've stumbled into the middle of some kind of ... robotic war ? We 've got to get Torres back now . Agreed , but first I want to show both those ships this isn 't our fight . Ease us back on maneuvering thrusters , Mr. Paris . Nice and steady . The second ship is hailing us . On screen . Cravic Automated Commander 122 requests you identify yourself . My name is Kathryn Janeway , Captain of the Federation Starship Voyager . Withdraw from this area immediately . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . One of my crew members is being held hostage aboard the Pralor vessel . I won 't leave without her . Remain at your present coordinates and do not attempt to intervene , or you will be fired on . Captain , this new ship could be a ... The diversion we 've been looking for . Mr. Kim , what 's the status of our warp engines ? We 're still an hour away at best . We may not have an hour . Get down to Engineering . Be ready to give me as much power as you can , the minute we get Torres back . Aye , Captain . If those two ships keep each other busy , we may not need warp to get away . Mr. Paris , report to the shuttle bay . Yes , ma 'am . Chakotay , you have the Conn . Who are they ? Automated personnel units of the Cravic homeworld . Robots from another world ? That is correct . Why are they attacking you ? They were programmed to do so by their Builders . Prototype Unit 0001 is ready to accept programming . The Cravic Builders , the Pralor Builders ... were they enemies ? That is correct . Look , maybe Captain Janeway can contact the Cravic leaders and convince them to stop the fighting . That is not possible . Why not ? The Cravic are also extinct . I 'm approaching the perimeter of the defense field . Acknowledged . Rotate your shield harmonics until they are synchronized with the frequency of the field . Shields synchronized . I 'm going in . Then again , maybe not . It didn 't work . He bounced right off the field . Mr. Paris , reset your heading for coordinates 105 mark 40 . Uh , if I understand you , Tuvok , that would take me into a direct line of fire with the Cravic ship . Precisely . The concentration of fire is opening a rift in the Pralor defense field . Which I just might be able to sneak through , if I can dodge a disruptor blast or two . Changing heading . If both sides were annihilated , then why continue your war ? All automated personnel units were programmed to achieve victory . Prototype Unit 0001 is ready to accept programming . The Cravic ship has penetrated our defense shield . Has anyone , in all these years , ever tried to stop this war ? The Pralor and the Cravic called a truce . Wait a minute . If both sides called a truce , then why didn 't they stop you from fighting ? They attempted to do so . And ? We terminated the Builders . Paris to Voyager . I 'm approaching the entry point . Acknowledged . Showing a rift in the defense field off your starboard bow . I 'm on it . When it was anticipated that the war would end , the Builders no longer required our services and they attempted to terminate us . In doing so , they became the enemy . We are programmed to destroy the enemy . It is necessary for our survival . Now that you have constructed the prototype , we will soon outnumber the Cravic units . We will achieve victory . This is 3947 . Fire units , report to Reconstruction Bay Number One . The individual energy codes ... is that why the Builders added them ... to prevent the procreation of these units ? My God , what have I done ? Prototype Unit 0001 is ready to accept programming . You have terminated the prototype . Yes ... I have . You will build another . Never . Lieutenant B 'Elanna Torres , I told 6263 you were not our enemy . I never wanted to be your enemy . I 'm sorry . Shuttle to Voyager . I 've got her , but she 's injured . Tell the Doctor to stand by . Beam her out as soon as I clear the defense field . Acknowledged , Mr. Paris . The ships are continuing to exchange fire , Captain . They are ignoring the shuttle . Bridge to Engineering . Stand by warp engines . We 'll engage the moment Mr. Paris gets back . Aye , Captain . One pot of Landras blend , compliments of the chef . Mmm . I never thought Neelix 's coffee could taste so good . I 'll tell him you said so . I don 't know what to say . As far as I 'm concerned ... you did what you thought was necessary to ensure the safety of this crew . Thank you . It must have been difficult . Difficult ? To destroy what you created . It was necessary . I read your report . It was no small achievement , B 'Elanna . You gave that unit life . You should have seen it , Captain . It was incredible . I installed that module and the prototype looked up at me and asked me for programming . As I said , it must 've been difficult . It was necessary .

 I reviewed your case and your service record ... combat duty in Panama , Grenada , distinguished service in the Gulf , great triumphs and great tragedies . It 's clear to me , Lieutenant Colonel , - these suicide attempts are simply ... - Cries for help . You 've tried and failed to kill yourself three times in as many weeks . - Frankly , if you wanted to ... - You don 't understand . He won 't let me . He won 't let me die . Who ? Who won 't let you die ? Relax . I 'll be back with something to help you sleep . Stand down , Lieutenant Colonel . No ! Not this time ! - Aah ! Just let me go ! Oh , my God . - Where is he ? - Down here . He 's in there . Easy . I-I told you he won 't let me die . I don 't wanna talk about it anymore . I told them and I told them , but they won 't listen . - You mean they don 't believe you . - No , sir . You said in the report that at the time of the accident , you believed somebody was in the room . It was no accident . Don 't you understand ? But this person saved your life , is that right ? Look at me . Look ! I have no life . He took it all away . Do you have any idea who it is ? I never see him clearly , but he looks like a soldier , standin ' at attention . - G.I. ? - Or one of Saddam 's boys , come back to hold me accountable . Who ever it is , he knows my name . He speaks to you ? " Your time has come , " he said . Then he started takin ' it all away . What did he start taking away ? Everything . My wife , my children . - And how did he do that ? - How did ... He burned them alive . Now he makes me suffer ... because he won 't let me die . Agents Mulder and Scully , may I have a word with you ? I 've been asked to suspend whatever investigation you 've begun here . Asked by whom , Captain . General Callahan , Lieutenant Colonel Stans ' commanding officer . - Is something wrong ? - Protocol requires ... all criminal investigation of military personnel ... to be conducted through military channels and their superior officer . What ? We didn 't sign in at the front desk ? You 're in breach of code and procedure . Excuse me , but does General Callahan have a superior officer ? - Ma 'am ? - Assuming we wanted to investigate him , - who would we talk to ? - Investigate him for what ? - Whatever . - General Callahan 's the senior officer . - We 'd like to speak to him . - I don 't know he 's available . Ask him to make himself available . Tell him that it 's our protocol . In the meantime , we would like to finish up with Lieutenant Colonel Stans . You never know when he might try and kill himself again . Let 's finish this , Mulder . I keep having the same dream almost every night . I know a lot of crips have the same dream : " The Walk . " In my dream , I rise up out of my chair , I can stand . And I look down the hallway , only I 'm not in the ward anymore , I 'm at home . There 's my baby girl . Without even thinking about it , I take a step towards her , and I take another step . Then I pick her up and I carry her outside on my own two feet . Outside is my little boy . We run together . Running . Me ! My legs , like they were before . We play a little bit of football . I show him a few moves . You know , like the old man used to do . We just walk home . No crutches , no wheelchairs . I know I 'll never walk again , but this dream seems so real . I can 't help but think that may be someday ... Don 't hold your breath . I think we 'd all be interested in your point of view , Leonard . Oh , you really wanna know what I think ? I pity all you guys . I really do . With your handicapped basketball and your wheelchair races . You all act like we 're normal people . - We are normal people . - If you look in the mirror , my friend , you are missing a leg . I-I don 't have any . Where ... Where 'd my arms go ? - We all know how you feel . - No , you don 't . How the hell could you possibly know how I feel ? There 's only one way you could ever know , and I can only pray he 'll come down and take your legs and arms away ... and give you a little taste of what it feels like ! Roach . I 'm sorry , gentlemen . Let 's begin again . - What is it , Roach ? - What 's what ? You got that " I 'm freakin ' out " look on your face . - What 's the matter ? - It 's nothing . Bull . I spent two years with your sorry ass in a gun turret . I think I know when you got something on your mind . Come on , Private . Make your report . It 's the F.B.I. , man . They 're downstairs . They 're asking questions about the L.C. The hell with the Feds . All right , Roach ? Do you hear me ? The hell with them . just forget about them . General . Sir ? Agents Mulder and Scully to see you , sir . - Thank you . I want you to know ... - General . I 've had the captain contact the Justice Department ... and let them know about the F.B.I. ' s gross misconduct here . I guess this isn 't a good time to thank you for seeing us . Let me assure you , this matter will not go unaddressed . I hope not , considering the extremity of Lieutenant Colonel Stans ' case . What case ? There 's no case . Stans is a very sick man . Yes , so we gathered . But his file is missing ... several important facts which came out in our interview with him . I 'm sure everything germane to Stans ' situation is on file . Except for any mention of the death of his wife and two children ... in a house fire three months ago . - Well , it was a tragic accident . - No doubt . But there is no record of any criminal or arson investigation . Stans tried to save his family that night . Well , according to him , he was prevented from doing so ... by some kind of phantom soldier . Look . I 've known Stans a long time , and there 's no doubt that he has suffered terribly . Not unlike Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen . You know Sergeant Aiklen , isn 't that correct , sir ? He served under me in the Gulf , yes . Six months ago , Aiklen also lost his family to a house fire . Afterwards , he received psychiatric treatment for delusional behavior , telling the doctors he wanted to die , but that somebody wouldn 't let him . Before throwing himself into a wood chipper on the hospital grounds . Now , unless that 's procedure and protocol , I 'd say the coincidence of detail has been rather strangely overlooked , sir . Hold on . Just who 's under suspicion here ? Look . I make no excuses for the sadness of these men 's lives . They are casualties of war . Once brave men who we can do little but feel sorry for . If you think there 's more to it , you are seriously mistaken . That 's your conclusion , General . But I 'd hope you 'd allow us the opportunity to come to our own . Do you really think the general 's got something to hide ? No . I think he 's got everything to hide . You don 't think he 's just closing ranks to protect his men ? Mulder , I know it 's not what drew you to this case to begin with , but I think it 's very clear what 's going on here . What 's that ? The general is protecting his men , but what he 's protecting them from ... is prosecution for the murder of their families . - Why would he do that ? - I don 't know . But I can think of several good reasons . Because they were his soldiers and he feels somewhat responsible ... - for the tragedies ? - That could be one . Or maybe he knows the deeper secrets to their madness , the biological weapons they were exposed to during the war , the cause of the effect . Considering the government 's absolute disavowal of Gulf War Syndrome , I 'd say it 's a pretty good reason to prevent our investigation . But you 're not buying it . No . I can 't figure out is why a man who so deliberately and methodically ... set out to commit suicide would leave the one entrance to the room unsecured . Then again , I obviously have a feeble grasp of army protocol and procedure . - Come in . I want to apologize , sir . I didn 't mean to put you on the spot like that earlier . - I know that , Captain . - This whole situation is unfortunate . Is there anything more I can do ? No . Go home and get some rest . We 'll deal with it in the morning . Relax , Captain . That 's an order . Yes , sir . Your time has come , killer . General Callahan . One of the detectives is saying Captain Draper 's death wasn 't accidental . There are bruises around her neck and her shoulder , roughly the size of finger marks . And someone drowned her ? The bruises and surrounding edema are consistent with a struggle . Will you be contacting her family ? She had no family . The army was her family . I 'm sorry . Truly . - I talked with security personnel . Other than Captain Draper , they saw no one enter and no one leave . But the officers are saying she was drowned . - Do you have a family of your own ? - Yes . Why ? If the pattern is at all consistent , you and your family may be in danger . Based on what , the death of my adjutant ? Just keep an eye on them . Watch out for anything out of the ordinary . - Mulder , you 're serious ? - This is a military base , Scully . They 've got security everywhere . No one saw or heard a thing . It 's not so hard to believe . Her screams would have been muffed . There would be no fingerprints . It also fits the M.O. of Lieutenant Colonel Stans ' phantom killer . Agent Mulder , what did you mean by that ? It was just a word to the wise , sir . No , I mean " anything out of the ordinary . " Any unusual or unexplained phenomena . Last night , I saw someone in my office . He said my name , but when I turned around , he was gone . Then , my phone machine went all snaky again . Again ? This happened before ? No , not what I saw . But the phone calls , yes . Twice before at my home . Mom , mail 's here ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! What is it ? What is it , honey ? - Mom , there was a man here . - Who ? Oh , thank God you 're home . I was trying to reach you . Trevor saw someone in the house just a few minutes ago . - Is he all right ? - He 's in his room , but he 's terrified . - I 'm ... I 'm shaking myself . - These people are with the F.B.I. - Is it about the break-in ? - Why don 't you check on Trevor ? - Why ? What 's happening ? - Frances , please . - We 'll talk upstairs . This way . It just comes on . The phone doesn 't even ring . At first , I thought it was a prank . - Did you save the other ones ? No , I erased them . I even called the phone company , had them check the line . They checked the whole house . They couldn 't find anything wrong . Have you noticed any other type of electronic interference , Like the radio or the television ? No . Not a thing . There 's someone in the backyard . I saw someone out here . I 'm sure of it . Look . You 'd better call the police , General . You 're gonna feel a little stick here . That 's right . I can 't change the dosage . There . That 's fine . I 'll be back in a minute . That was too close , man . I ain 't doing it anymore . - What ? - I said I ain 't doing it anymore . You owe me , Roach . I wouldn 't be in this damn chair if it wasn 't for you . Hey ! This isn 't about you and me , man . This is about all the grunts and all the crips ... and all the boys who came home in a box . The enemy must be defeated , and we 're gonna do it . You 're gonna do your part , and I 'm gonna do mine . Nurse ! Hey ! What do you do , man , when I rap on the tank ? Get some , get some , fire at will . Good . You 're all right . Nurse , come on ! This is killin ' me here ! What a mess . You 've got to learn to sit still . How about you never do it right ? There . That ought a hold it . - Find anything ? - No . But I like the tune . Well , we 've been a bit luckier . Whoever 's targeted the general didn 't just leave footprints . They left fingerprints as well . Really . Where ? Forensics just lifted two matching indexes and a thumb . One on the mailbox and one on the door leading to the backyard . We 'd better go run ' em . They 're on their way to the N.C.I.C. as we speak . - F.B.I. Open the door ! - Hands up ! Hands over your head ! - Don 't shoot ! - Turn around ! - Okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay . Put your hands down behind your back . Cuff him . Quinton Freely , you are under arrest for suspicion of murder . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court flaw . If you want an attorney , we 'll give you one if you don 't have one ... " Captain Janet Draper . Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen . Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans . " General and Mrs. Thomas Callahan . We 've got him , Mulder . Watch your left flank there . Okay . Trevor ? Hey , Trevor ! We have enough evidence to place you at each of the crime scenes . In addition to accessory to murder , you 're looking at conspiracy , breaking and entering , commission of a felony on federal property ... - Can I get a cigarette ? - No . We know you weren 't acting alone . We know you had an accomplice . How did he do it , Quinton ? I don 't know . I don 't know what you 're talking about . How did he get past the guard ? How did he kill him ? Trevor was only eight years old . I don 't know . I didn 't kill anybody . I 'm just the mailman . What does that mean , " you 're just the mailman " ? I 'm Rappo 's mailman . Leonard Trimble , right ? If that 's the man they call Rappo . That 's him . What 's he done ? He 's a suspect in two homicides . Rappo ? You must be making some kind of mistake . How 's that ? There . See for yourself . He 's a quadruple amputee . Damn it . He lied to us . He said he was the mailman . What did he mean by that ? I don 't know . I 'm adding it to the list . Are you coming ? No . I 'll catch up with you later . He knows this place . He can find me here . He knows this place ! He 's been here before ! I 'm not safe here ! - Hey , keep it down in there ! - Let me outta here ! He 's going to kill me ! I 'm a dead man ! Let me out ! Let me out ! I 'm not gonna tell you again . He 's gonna kill me ! He 's here ! He 's here ! You don 't wanna get him started again . He was pretty worked up about an hour ago . Not as worked up as I 'm gonna be . Visitor . On your feet ! God Almighty . How did it happen ? Suffocation . The bed sheet was stuffed down his throat . - Nobody 'd been in the cell with him ? - He did all it by himself . - Not likely . - Not likely ? He had help , Scully . And he wasn 't lying because I think the man ... - that killed him was Leonard Trimble . - Rappo ? - Yeah . - He can 't walk , let alone kill somebody . You see this ? This is a dental X-ray plate . I know , you 've been walking around with this since we got here . The ones I 've been walking around with I had developed at the hospital . See , this is the one I was carrying when we first me Stans , this one in the rehab room , in the pool , in the general 's office and this one at the general 's house . - All exposed to some kind of radiation . - From what ? From Stans ' phantom soldier . I came down here wondering if it could be true , if what Stans was describing was a case of astral projection . What you 're saying is this man , Rappo , is leaving his body and floating around town killing people ? Practitioners claim that during a self-hypnotic trance , the astral body can actually detach itself and float virtually anywhere , sometimes invisible , but sometimes appearing as an apparition . They even claim that the astral body has psychokinetic capabilities ... far greater than the corporeal body . Mulder ... Then why would he need Quinton Freely ? Maybe he needs a psychic connection to a place thing or object ... a letter . - Quinton called himself the mailman . - It 's insane . Sometimes the only sane response to an insane world is insanity . - Know anything about backwards masking ? You mean messages recorded backwards in songs ? Yeah . Or on the general 's answering machine . Check this out . Your time has come , killer . Your time has come . - Leonard Trimble ? - No , it 's Fred Astaire . Mr. Trimble , we 'd like to ask you a few questions about Quinton Freely . - Roach ? What 's he done now ? - He 's dead . Oh . Well , serves him right . - How 's that ? - How 's that ? He turned me into second base by getting my arms and legs blown off . Other than that , he was a real good guy . Then why 'd you kill him ? What 's wrong with this picture ? We read your medical records , Leonard . We know that you 've refused all efforts at rehabilitation . You 've even refused to be fitted with prosthetic limbs . Big deal . Maybe I don 't want any of that crap . Maybe because you don 't need it ... Maybe because you don 't need it ... because you can leave your body any time you want . Kill anybody you wanna kill . If I could leave my body , I could think of something else I 'd rather be doing . Like kill General Callahan 's boy ? Lieutenant Colonel Stans ' family ? Sergeant Aiklen ? You 're a real trip . Oh , I 'm " a trip " ? Because I figured you out ? You 're a soldier . You knew what you were gettin ' into when you enlisted . You want to blame everybody else . Why blame your C.O.s ? I blame them for what happened to all of us . You don 't know what it was like . You ... You sat at home and watched the war ... on cable TV like it was a damn video game . You had no idea about the guys that died , about the blood in the sand , what it feels like when a hit comes . The thing is , you just don 't care , do you ? You got your crude oil . just change that station , right ? Killer got his prime time . L.C. got his fancy little medals . Now take a good look at me . What did I get ? Nobody knows how I feel . They took my life away . Yeah , so you took theirs . If I only could . Now , if you 're through questioning me , I 'd like to get a little shut-eye . No sleepwalking . That 's good . I haven 't heard that one yet . Hardy-har-har . What do you wanna do ? Call General Callahan and warn him to stay out of his house . Frances ? Honey , leave that . No , I know how it upsets you when his ... toys are spread all over the place . We can handle this , Frances . I don 't wanna handle this . I want my son back . Frances ! Oh ... my God . No one 's answering . The machine 's not picking up . - General ? - Lieutenant Colonel . - What are you doing ? - You were right , Victor . - He won 't let you die . - Sir ? He kills our wives and children , but he won 't let us die . - I know who he is , General . I know who he is . General Callahan , sir . I 've been waitin ' for you . Who are you ? One of your boys , General . You killed my wife . That 's right , sir , I did . And the boy too . Come on , killer . Come on , killer Callahan . Get some ! Get some ! Come on , killer ! Do it ! Fire at will ! Come on , killer . Do it ! What was that ? Come on , killer . You can do better than that ! Come on ! You 're gonna suffer like the rest of us . You think I 'm gonna let it end this way ? Do you ? Is that what you think ? General . He wanted me to kill him . I stood down . I 'm done here . Scully ? He 's having some kind of a seizure . No , I don 't think so . Nurse ! General Callahan ! Killer ? Come on , killer . Your time has come . General Callahan ! General Callahan ! He 's nonresponsive . Come on . Put him on the monitors and prep the crash cart . - He 's going into cardiac arrest . - Okay . - And make sure the ... Lieutenant Colonel ! Get the keys . We have to open the door . Open the door ! Lieutenant Colonel , open the door ! General Callahan , are you hurt ? I 'm okay . " No physical evidence was found linking Leonard Trimble ... to the deaths of General Callahan 's wife and son . Officially , the investigation remains open . The murders unsolved . Leonard Trimble 's family requested his burial at Arlington National Cemetery . The army denied this request . Trimble was cremated , his ashes interred ... at a civilian cemetery in Tannersville , Pennsylvania . Leonard Trimble 's mission was not to kill his enemies , but to shatter their lives , to keep them alive , to suffer the pain he felt , - to see the view from his wheelchair . Amputees sometimes feel the pain of phantom limbs , ghosts of hands still clenching , legs still aching . Is it not possible that Trimble developed a phantom soul ? A malevolent psyche took its violent revenge on those he held accountable . It was war that destroyed Leonard Trimble 's body . But his wounds went deeper than the loss of his limbs . What destroyed those parts of him that make us human beings , those better angels of our nature ? I cannot say " . supplied by CoBeR coberus @ go2.pl

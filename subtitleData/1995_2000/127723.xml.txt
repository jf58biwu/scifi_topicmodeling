 JOHN F. KENNEDY : Many years ago ... the great British explorer George Mallory ... who was to die on Mount Everest ... was asked why did he wantto climb it . He said , " Because it is there . " Well , space is there , and we 're going to climb it . And the moon and the planets are there . And new hopesfor knowledge and peace are there . And , therefore , as we set sail ... we ask God 's blessing ... on the most hazardous and dangerous ... and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked . Thankyou .

Transmission nominal . Long distance ... connected . At ease , Lieutenant . - Yes , sir , Admiral . - Good . You are currently outbound ... to the Vega sector and the Tiger Claw . I need you to hand-deliver ... an encrypted communications chip to her captain . Why not send it by drone to the Pegasus , sir ? That 'd be quicker . The Pegasus is gone ... destroyed by a Kilrathi battle group ... twelve and a half hours ago . See that Captain Sansky gets that chip . Why me ? lfought alongside yourfather in the Pilgrim wars . He was a good man . Godspeed . TAGGART : Well , guys ... we have to jump into the Vega sector ... a little soonerthan planned . Set a coursefor beacon 147 , one-quarter impulse ... and be subtle . Setting course for beacon one-four-seven . One-quarter impulse . [ Beeping ] MARSHALL : I 'm reading that as a 100,000-kilometer ... no-fly zone , sir . Just put in beacon 147 . It 's a shortcut . Aye , Captain . [ Knock on door ] Yeah ? We 're holding steady on the beacon . Marshall has the helm . Those must be antiques . They were made by thefirst explorers in this sector ... just like the cross you wear underyour shirt . May I see it ? There was a time long ago ... when people looked up to the Pilgrims . The stars were their destiny . Since the Pilgrims were defeated ... not a single new quasar has been charted . COMPUTER : lncreasing thrust ... Stupid ... COMPUTER : Main engine now at ninety percent . TAGGART : Out ! You get out ! Get out , get out ! MARSHALL : Ow . Jeez ! What 's your problem ? - What ? - Did you change course ? MARSHALL : No , I didn 't change course . I just boosted the power . Why dog it ? We can be atthe beacon in , like , under an hour . That beacon is marking a gravity well . One cubic inch of it ... exerts more gravitationalforce than the sun . COMPUTER : Navcom on-line . TAGGART : If we approach it toofast ... we 'll be sucked in out of control . If I don 't realign our entry vector ... we are not going to make the jump . - What happens if we miss ? - We die . blair : Have we reached the entry vector 's PNR yet ? No , no . Notyet .

MARSHALL : Whoa . What is this thing ? This thing is a distortion in space-time . The Pilgrims were thefirstto chart it . If it 's charted , why is it off-limits ? Because it 's unstable . It 's unstable ? Whoa. it 's unstable , and we 're gonna jump it ? ! [ Alarm blares ] Navigational computer justwent off-line ! I 'm on it ! - Blair ! - Yes , sir ?

Communications ? I wantthis disk decrypted ASAP . OBUTU : Yes , sir . GERALD : Oh , Lieutenant ? You wouldn 't be related to Arnold Blair , would you ? He was myfather , sir . He married a Pilgrim woman , didn 't he ? Yes , sir . Pilgrims don 'tthink like us . You won 't have to worry , sir . They 're both dead . I 'm sure the lieutenant 's heredity ... will have no bearing on his performance , Mr. Gerald . No , sir. I 'm sure itwon 't . I suggestyou stow your gear ... andfamiliarize yourself with the ship . That 's all , Lieutenant . MARSHALL : Yo , B. Look atthese rapiers . They 're beatto hell , man . I don 't see any of the hornets weflew back atthe academy . Oh , whoa , whoa , whoa . You know what I do see ? Blonde . Hey , how you doing ? merlin : Systems on-line . Hello , I 'm Merlin ... the latest in mobile interface cockpit- - DEVEREAUX : Two Dralthis on yourtail--one above , one below . You gotfive , maybe ten seconds . Clock 's ticking . What do you do ? Simple . I go vertical and inverted ... do a 180 atfull throttle ... apply brakes ... and drop in behind ' em . Bang , you 're dead . Notfast enough . Dralthis are too quick , particularly in a climb . You 've justtaken a missile upyourtailpipe . OK , let 's reverse the situation . You 're locked on a Dralthi . It goes evasive , enters an asteroid belt . If I 'm locked on ... there 's no such thing as evasive action . And you 're dead again . You see , it 's an ambush . Five or sixfighters hide behind rocks ... the size of your swollen head and pounce . A Kilrathi gang-bang . What 's the matter ? Did I bruise your ego ? No. I 'm just , uh , not used to getting combattips ... from a grease monkey , that 's all . Lieutenant Commander Deveraux ... yourwing commander . You have a name ? Uh , Lieutenant Blair , ma 'am . Well , Lieutenant Blair ... if you wantto play at being afighter pilot ... I suggestyoufind a virtualfun zone . Meanwhile , step downfrom the rapier . I apologize , ma 'am . The mission sheet said the rapierwas unassigned . I didn 't realize it belonged to Lieutenant Commander Chen . What are you doing on theflight deck ? MARSHALL : Getting acquainted with our new surroundings . MARSHALL : Good job , B. We 're on the ship five minutes ... and you 're already hitting on ourwing commander ? blair : How was I to know ? MARSHALL : She 's just another tight-ass C.O. Who cares ? Let it go . Now I 'm gonna show you how to makefriends . MARSHALL : How you doing ? Allow me to introduce myself .

Firstway involves you trying to kickthe shit out of me . HUNTER : And the otherway ? Forbes ? We 're on stand-down . One won 't hurt . MARSHALL : Well , it may even help , huh ? Here you go , mate . Allow me . You got balls . - You should see ' em . - Mine are bigger . I 've been told size doesn 't matter . She lied . Do you know what , Hunter ? I would have taken the third option . MARSHALL : Really . I would have kicked his ass first , then drank his scotch . Oh ! Touch√â . COMPUTER : Message on-line . Playback in progress . TOLWYN : Jay , I 'm gonna have to be brief . The Kilrathi took Pegasus . They may have her Navcom A.l. By the time this communication reaches you ... they will be twenty-three hours ... from the Charybdis jump point and Earth . Confed capital ships are headed home now . The Concordia battle group ... will only be able to make it in twenty-five hours . I 'm ordering the Tiger Claw to the Charybdis quasar . You are to use any means necessary ... to gather information as to the Kilrathi whereabouts ... capacity , and plan of attack . I need intelligence , oldfriend . Use Taggart . He knows this space betterthan any man alive . He can getyou to Charybdis quickly . I don 't like it . What don 'tyou like , Paul ? The disk came to us on the Diligent ... entrusted to a Pilgrim half-breed . Sendforthis Taggart . MARSHALL : Why don 'tyou take his castle ... with your little horsey ? Check ... Mate . FORBES : So , there 's a brain behind that mouth . Yourfriend always this talkative ? MARSHALL : No , he just made thefatal error ... of mistaking ourwing commander ... foryour average grease monkey . Listen , all I did was sit in Commander Chen 'sfighter . blair : Lieutenant Commander Chen ? Bossman ? HUNTER : You 're talking about a bloke that never existed . I 'm pretty sure he did . He ... never ... existed . Now change the subject quickly , pal ... before I change itforyou . MARSHALL : You got a problem with myfriend , Mr. Hunter ? HUNTER : Yes , I do . MARSHALL : That means you got a problem with me . - ls that so ? - Yeah . HUNTER : Well , you 're gonna love this . He 's a Pilgrim ! DEVEREAUX : Stand down , or you 'll have a problem with me . I want an explanation . Hunter ? - Ma 'am ? - Ma 'am ? Lieutenant Hunterwas just helping Marshall and I ... feel at home . DEVEREAUX : Lieutenant ? HUNTER : Yeah . That 's right , ma 'am . blair : Yeah . You see ? I guess this conversation never existed . Lieutenant ? Lieutenant ! Who in the hell do you thinkyou are ? Let me give you a reality check . In all likelihood , you 're going to die out here . We 're all going to die out here ... but none of us need to be reminded of thatfact ... so you die , you never existed . Understand ? Yes , ma 'am . GERALD : Taggart , sir . Ah. I know of you , Mr. Taggart ... but I 'm afraid I don 't know you . And yetyou come to me with classified orders ... from Admiral Tolwyn . Oh , I see . The captain doesn 'ttrust me ... Blair , orthe disk . Would you ? Well , uh ... no . No . This tactical schematic outlines a nightmare , Mr. Taggart . lttells me thatthe Kilrathi may have a Navcom ... and with itthe capacity to jump into Earth space . And based on that nightmare ... it orders me to take radical action ... which , if it and you are a lie ... could compromise this ship and its crew . So I 'm bound to askyou , Mr. Taggart ... what proof do you have thatthis is authentic ? Where did you getthis ? Tolwyn ... thought it might be useful ... if I ever had to convince a captain ... tofollow his orders . Mr. Obutu . Plot a course forthe Charybdis quasar . Full speed , if you please . [ Keystrokes ] OBUTU : Sir , the nearest jump pointto the Charybdis ... isfour days hard travel from our current location . TAGGART : There 's a class-two pulsar eleven hoursfrom here . We can jumpthere . OBUTU : It 's not on the chart , sir . Navcom does not have those coordinates . I have them . No one 's jumped a pulsar forforty years ... and even then , they were Pilgrims . I don 't believe we have a choice , Mr. Gerald . If the battle is to be decided in the Charybdis quasar ... then that 's where we have to be . Plotyour course , Mr. Taggart . Sure . Sir , that ring means nothing . This ring has been in Tolwyn 's familyfor sixteen generations . And any man who carries it ... has the admiral 's full confidence ! Prepareforthe jump . blair : Hey . We goin ' out ? No . Just me . I pulled security with Lieutenant Forbes . Why 'd you wake me up ? Remember back atthe academy ? You promised you would take thatthing off . It brings me luck . It 's gonna getyou killed . I was wearing it when I made the jump . Yeah , butthat had nothing to do with luck . Thatwas abouttraining , skill , desire . Now , please . Take the cross off . It 's who I am . You don 't even know what it means . This is the big show . And you gotta have someone watching your back . It 's either kill or be killed . And you know what ? I can 't always be there . [ Chuckles ] Hey , I 'm tryin ' to be Mr. Sensitive Guy . It 's just--Ahh ! I don 't even know why I bother . All right . Wish me luck . blair : Luck ? What about desire ? MARSHALL : You seen Lieutenant Forbes ? You know I got desire . blair : Hey , Marshall ... Luck . Mmm . officer ON LEFT : Messagefrom Earth Command . Their defenses are on line , sir , but- - They don 't believe ... they can withstand a Kilrathi battle group ... withoutthe support of thefleet . Butthey willfight , sir . Earth will never surrender . What 's our status ? We 're running at one-hundred-and-ten percent . We 've already lostthree ships- - two atjump points , and one 's reactor core melted down . Run at one hundred and twenty . DEVEREAUX : Now , if Dibbles had theflying skills of a woman ... he 'd still be alive . MARSHALL : You gotta be kidding me . DEVEREAUX : Don 'ttake it personally , Nugget . It 's a question of estrogen . Women can outfly and outshoot men . It has been proven ... thatwe can keeptrack of uptofour enemyfighters . No , ittakes balls , big balls ... not ovaries , to maintain four enemyfighters ... and that 's afact , Jack . All right , watch this . Con. Con.

Betterthan sex with myself . [ Both laugh ] You just see that it never happens again . [ Opera music playing ] [ Door opens ] blair : Sir ? Can I talkto you ? TAGGART : Yeah . Go ahead . blair : My whole life ... I 've taken crap because I 'm part Pilgrim . And I don 't know why . Sit down . You 're one of the last descendants of a dying race . Pilgrims were thefirst human space explorers and settlers . Forfive centuries ... they defied the odds . They embraced space ... andforthat , they were rewarded ... with the gift of aflawless sense of direction . They couldfeel magneticfields ... created by quasars and black holes ... created by quasars and black holes ... negotiate singularities ... navigate notjustthe stars , but space-time itself . Like a Navcom A.l. ? TAGGART : No , no . You 've got it backwards . The billions of calculations each second ... necessary to lead us through a black hole or a quasar ... is the Navcom recreation of the mind of a single Pilgrim . Then why 'd the war start ? [ Sighs ] You spend so much time out here alone ... you end up losing your humanity . When Pilgrims began to lose touch with their heritage ... they saw themselves as superiorto men . And in their arrogance ... they chose to abandon all things human ... andfollow whatthey called their " destiny . " Some say they believed they were gods . You believe they were gods ? No . But I do believe they were touched by God . And like it or not ... you 've got some of that inside you . I have to getto the bridge . We 'll be jumping soon . I wantyou to be there .

They 'd spotted ... Lieutenant Commander Deveraux 's heat signature . GERALD : Really ? Angel , how sure are you ... thatthe Kilrathi had you targeted ? Given the Lieutenant 's background ... are you really that certain ? Excuse me ? It 's well documented that Pilgrim saboteurs ... have been responsible ... for much of the Confed 's problems in this war . Did they have me targeted , Lieutenant ? wilson : Now , come on . This is sterile conjecture . The Kilrathi are well aware ... that rapiers don 'tjustfly around ... in deep space without a carrier close by . Thankyou , Lieutenant .

So I say we send them a message . I can have myfighters up in thirty minutes . No , no . That 's a mistake . Without herfighters ... the Tiger Claw 's vulnerable . GERALD : You are a civilian scout , Mr. Taggart ... not a naval officer . Tactical operations are our concern . We are the Earth 's only hope . We need to buy ourfleet two hours . And you 're willing to risk all that ... chasing after a communications ship ? wilson : I 'm sorry , Mr. Taggart . Destroying the concom with its escorts ... will slow the Kilrathi . Deveraux will lead a strikeforce . And as you have charted the area before ... you will accompany her . If you say so , Captain .

They weren 't angels . They were dead , gone . They never existed . Like Bossman ? Emotion gets in the way . Commander , emotion is what separates us ... from the Pilgrims andfrom the Kilrathi .

Pegasus Navcom . Paladin ... they have the Charybdis jump coordinates . DEVEREAUX : is everything OK ? We 've secured thefuel cells . blair : We 've got more than that , Angel . We have the Kilrathi jump coordinates . DEVEREAUX : Marines , move out . GERALD : Mr. Obutu , prepare drone . lnputthe Kilrathi jump coordinates . Send itthrough the Charybdis quasar ... to Admiral Tolwyn . They should be able to target the exact location ... of the Kilrathi jump entry . It 'll be over before they can gettheirweapons on-line . TAGGART : If Tolwyn 's there , Mr. Gerald . If he 's there . OBUTU : Sir , we have a problem . I can 't getthe drones on-line . Withoutthose coordinates , Tolwyn doesn 't have a chance . And we are too big to slip pastthe Kilrathi ... and warn thefleet . We 'll have to send afighterthrough . GERALD : lmpossible . There are over a thousand singularities in that quasar . To jump itwould be suicide without Navcom coordinates . TAGGART : We don 't need a Navcom . Blair ? You will navigate the quasar . Angel willfollow your lead . Sir , that 's statistically impossible . We don 't have another option . You have the gift . I don 'tthink I can . I don 't have thefaith . It 's notfaith. lt 's genetics . But if you believe you needfaith ... take mine . Why didn 'tyou tell me ? You didn 't ask . FALK : Sir ... long-range scanners picking up Kilrathi ships . Looks like a destroyer and a cruiser . TAGGART : We 'll create the diversion . GERALD : Getthose coordinates to Tolwyn . blair : Uh , I got a strong signal atten o 'clock . It 's gone , Angel. ltvanished . DEVEREAUX : Got it- - a skipper missile ... dead on course forthe Tiger Claw . Only thing that can kill it ... is a starfighter in visual contact . What are you doing , Angel ? DEVEREAUX : Just stay on course . Getthrough the jump point . What about our orders ? Angel . Angel ! [ Alarm ] GERALD : Report ! Sir , we have a bogey . Vector one-nine-seven markthree- - lt 's gone . It 's a skipper missile . We 're only picking it up ... when it de-cloaks to get a radarfix . TAGGART : Estimated time till impact ? One minute , sir . FALK : Forty-five seconds till impact . Sir , our shields are too weak to take a direct hit . It 's in those two kids hands now . FALK : Twenty seconds . COMPUTER : Warning ! Collision alert ! DEVEREAUX : Oh , shit ! Radar . No sign of the skipper missile , sir . One of the rapiers must have shot it down . Where are they now ? Are you all right ? Well , I might not be dancing for a while . All right , hang on . I 'm gonna tractoryou backto the ship . No , no , you 're not . You 're going on . We can 't both disobey orders . You 'll be out of air in an hour . You 're going backto the ship . You disobey my order ... and I 'll have you court-martialed . Like I care . Then care about the billions who will die ... if thefleet doesn 't get the jump coordinates . You 've gotto go on . You know that . You 're all right , Angel . You too , Chris . OBUTU : The Kilrathi ships are closing . So what now ? Now we make them sorry they were ever born . Battle stations . Battle stations ! Battle stations ! Merlin , check my coordinates .

He 's beingfollowed by something massive , Admiral . Looks like a Snakeir . richard : Permission to intercept it ? TOLWYN : No , we wait . The Snakeir will overtake Blair 'sfighter . Sir , if we don 't intercept ... the Snakeirwill reach Earth orbit before us . The casualties could be significant . I 'm bloody well aware of that , Richard ! All ships are to target those jump coordinates . Blairto Confedfleet , a Kilrathi capital ship ... has penetrated the quasar 's jump point ... and is in Earth space . Copy ? They aren 't in radio range . Earth will never see ' em coming . merlin : I 'm detecting ... a Confederation signal , Lieutenant .

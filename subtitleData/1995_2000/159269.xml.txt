 BENDER SINGS : Going through the car wash Come on y 'all and sing it with me Car wash Car wash , yeah Ah ! Oh ! My Three Suns I 'm Elzar , welcome to the show . You don ' t have to drive to Neptune for great Neptunian food . We 'll kick it up a notch as I show you how to fricassee a mouthwatering Neptunian slug . While you grease the pan and preheat your oven to 3500 degrees separate the yolk from your enhanced eggplant and give it a blast from your spice weasel . Bam ! FRY : Hey , what you watching ? - Nothing . - Is that a cooking show ? No , of course not . It was porno . Yeah , that 's it ! I didn 't know you liked cooking . That 's so cute . It 's true . I 've been hiding it for so long . - It 's okay . I like cooking too . - Pansy . Your most important ingredient is this baby the Neptunian slug . You can get it in a can . But to do things right you gotta strangle yourself a fresh one . [ SLUG GURGLES ] This is why you always want to use cast-iron cookware . [ SLUG GURGLES ] It has come to my attention that we 're paying you to loaf on the couch . You call that a couch ? I demand a pillow ! If you want to continue to earn a salary you gotta do more than watch cooking shows all day . - You 're gonna be the ship 's cook ? - We 're gonna kick it up a notch . Bam ! I know you like cooking shows , but you are a robot without a sense of taste . I wouldn 't talk about taste , wearing a lime-green tank top . Bam ! - This is Little Neptune ? - Yep . This is the place to get exotic , gourmet ingredients . Among other things . Come on , man , don 't hold out on me like this . You want to buy organ ? Fresh . Ready for transplant . What 's this ? X-ray eye . See through anything . Wait . This says " Z RAY . " Z is better . It is two more than X. That would be an advantage . Do you take cash ? Be more careful . You 're not in the 20th century . - You don 't know how things work . - I 'm not a kid . I grew up in this city . These are my people . - What up ? - Word . You guys sell every meat except human . You want human ? What 's this spice for ? Swamp root , makes you irresistible to the opposite sex . That 's ridiculous . I 'll take two pounds . I 'm looking for fresh slug . - Yellow or purple ? - Whatever ! Purple causes diarrhea . Either one is fine . Have you seen Fry ? I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes . I 'll take the gills . Yes , gills . You don 't need lungs anymore . Can 't imagine why I would . I take lungs now . Gills come next week . Nurse ! Let 's do it ! You may feel small pain . Thank you . What were you doing ? I said to stay away from them . Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills ? - Good news . - I don 't like the sound of that ! You 'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol . A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone . Thank you and good night ! Are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone ? Of course . It 's just a name . Like the Death Zone , or the Zone of No Return . All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror . - Professor-- - Off you go . Pleasant trip . - Bender , how 's dinner coming ? - Almost ready . [ BENDER HUMS ] Ah ! Now for a dash of salt . [ BENDER HUMS ] This is Bender 's first meal . He 's a bit sensitive . Let 's be supportive . - All right ! FRY : Okay ! Oh , dear God ! That 's the saltiest thing I ever tasted . I once ate a bowl of salt . Is this salt water ? It 's salt with water in it . My vision 's fading . I 'm dying . There was nothing wrong with it . The salt level was 1 0o / o less than a lethal dose . I shouldn 't have had seconds . Here 's the package to deliver . For once in your life , be careful . This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror . I want it to be nice . - Ow ! - Don 't touch anything . Go to the palace and come right back . I was delivering things before you were born . I think I know what I am doing . [ SMACKS LIPS ] Stupid slug . I 've never been so thirsty . Come on , go down already . Ah ! [ PANTS ] Hello . Anybody home ? [ SLURPS ] The royal bottle is empty . You drank our emperor . No ! It wasn 't me ! [ BURPS ] You drank our emperor . You assassinated him . He looked so cool and refreshing . I am sure he was . But now he 's gone and your fate is sealed . All hail the new emperor . ALL : Hail ! Hail ! Hail ! After I specifically asked you not to touch anything ... ... you drank strange blue liquid ? It could 've been poisonous . Chances were equally good it was an emperor . I am Merg , the high priest . If I might interject ? - You might . - I humbly advise ... ... you choose a prime minister . I suggest Gorgak , the previous appointee . I will be a forceful administrator . I 've thought of becoming a prime minister . - I gotta go with Bender . - In your face , Gorgak . That 's it . As your captain , I order you back to the ship . Gee , I better check with my prime minister . Stay the course , pal . A package came for you . Hey , thanks . This got here just in time . This is your harem . You may choose any of these maidens to be your consort . How about that one ? I didn 't know you were into that sort of thing . On second thought , I 'll take that one . I 'm not here to pass judgment . Does anyone else think it 's odd that a 25-year-old delivery boy ... ... could kill the emperor and be rewarded , not punished ? Don 't beat around the bush . We know who you mean . Me , right ? Don 't worry . These people seem really mild-mannered . They are mild . You 're soaking in one right now . You touched me in ways I 've never been touched before . Ah ! There you are . Time to prepare for tomorrow 's coronation . A fancy-dress gala ! I 'll wear my formal shell . He 'll be enthroned with the setting of the three suns ... ... when we enter our nocturnal phase . Will there be a lot of speeches ? One . The absolutely flawless recitation ... ... from memory of the royal oath , by you . Will there be cake ? Hi . There you go . Get ready to laugh till your sides leak ... ... with our planet 's foremost political satirist ... ... Flof. What 's up with people from under the orange sun ? They 're all : [ GUTTURAL SOUNDS ] But us guys from under the red sun , we 're like : Oh . Oh . Oh . Right ? Am I right ? Yeah , he is right ! I have to talk to you . You 're in danger . LEELA : You see Emperor Plon here ? He met his end when drunk by Emperor Strug . And before he could even wipe his mouth ... ... Strug was drunk by Shwab . - So ? - Look ! Do you know what the average length of their reigns was ? - Eighty thousand years ? - No , one week . I knew you wouldn 't ask unless it was really high or low . Every emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one . And guess who 's next ? My assassin will get his . You 're in tremendous danger ! Half of them were drunk at their coronation . I plan on having a few brewskis myself . No , they were assassinated . You 'll be killed if you fail to recite the oath . - I 'll thumb through that later . - That 's so reckless . - Don 't you ever think ahead ? - If I did , I wouldn 't be emperor . I wouldn 't be here in 3000 . Like the story of the grasshopper and octopus . All year the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter ... ... while the octopus watched TV . FRY : The winter came and the grasshopper died . The octopus ate his acorns and got a race car . Is any of this getting through to you ? Oh , I give up ! This time I won 't be able to save you . I told you 1 00 times to stop treating me like a baby . Go gather your nuts , you nagging grasshopper . That 's it ! I 'll never help you again ! If anyone except you needs me , I 'll be in the ship . It 's not like anyone 's gonna drink me . [ SLURPING ] Quit it ! People of Trisol , it is my honor to present your new emperor . [ CLEARS THROAT ] What up ? - Stick to the oath . - Right . I , Fry , who drank Bont the Viscous ... ... who drank Ungo the Moist ... ... who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant ... ... who slurped Hudge the Dewy ... ... who had a soup of Throm the Chunky ... ... do solemnly swear to rule with honor and ... ... insanity. Integrity . Congratulations , Your Highness . I now present you with your royal unisex robe . Long live Fry the Solid . The suns are setting . I can finally switch to hard liquor . Ah ! Check out the glowing freaks . It 's beautiful . Hey , what 's that ? [ GASPING ] The emperor Bont ! He 's still alive . Of course I 'm alive . Cut this creep open and drain me out . My tummy hurts . They 're running up the stairs ! Shut up , you ! MERG : Let us in ! Fry must die so that Bont may live . What 'll I do ? We gotta get the emperor out before they kill you . I 'll spin you in a high-speed centrifuge ... ... separating out His Highness . - Won 't that crush my bones ? - The bones . I always forget about the bones . Sweat him out . I refuse to be dripped out through somebody 's armpit . I can vomit or urinate . How 's that ? My favorite so far is the bone-crushing . - What about crying ? - That 's a great idea ! That or the bone one . Keep it up , men . The veneer is starting to peel . GORGAK : Oh , dear . I want to cry , but I 'm just too macho . I 'll make you cry , buddy . You 're a pimple on society 's ass ! You 'll never amount to anything ! I was emperor of a planet . True . Here 's a disturbing reminder : Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead . These things happen . Grab a Kleenex for this one : There is no God , and your human ideals are laughable ! Phew ! That 's a load off my mind . Man , I guess it 's harder than I thought to make someone cry . - You did your best . - Up yours , bimbo . We 're in hot butter . We should call Leela for help . Cram it , lobster ! That is a good idea . I 'll call her . She 's still mad that I told her never to help me . Leela is not the type to hold a grudge . [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] OPERATOR : Collect call from : BENDER : I won ' t give my name to you . I 'll accept . Fry needs help . We don 't like each other . - I like you . - You do ? Are you gonna help ? I don ' t know why I should . Wait , wait . What is it you like best about me ? - Is she coming ? - I 'm not sure . But I do know she likes my in-your-face attitude . [ GASPING ] What the hell is that ? It 's the Juice-A-Matic 4000 . It 'll strain my juices from you and filter pulp : Your shredded remains . Why didn 't I think of that ? This is the saddest day of my life . And I still can 't cry ! Wait . Here comes Leela ! They have her totally outnumbered ! She 's risking her life for me after the way I treated her ? I don 't deserve this . I feel terrible . You do ? - Is she all right ? - I don 't know . Perhaps I 'll look out this window . Dear God ! They 're swarming all over . No ! What are you talking about ? She 's- - They are strapping her to the juicer . They 're putting some ice cubes in that glass under it . This can 't be happening . It can . And for all you know , it is . I 'm sorry , Fry . She 's dead . [ CRIES ] All she ever wanted to do was help me . And I was too proud and stupid to accept it . I wish I had died instead of her . LEELA : What are you talking about ? - You 're alive ! - Of course I am . I said you were dead so he 'd cry out the emperor . You wrecked it by surviving . We only got two drops . [ THUMP ON DOOR ] What the- - ? [ EMPEROR LAUGHS ] It 's only a matter of time . I 'll handle this . I think I can get us out of this if you 're willing to let me help . Thanks , Leela . I 'll take all the help you 'll give . I know you want what 's best for me . Ow ! What 's that for ? Come on ! - That hurt . - I know . Amy , get the bottle . Ow ! - Now I understand . - Come on , everybody help Fry . [ CRIES ] Thanks , everybody . I love you all . You guys are true- - Cut it out , Bender . That 's a tender area . - How we doing , Amy ? - We 're 1 / 1 0 of the way there . [ SOBS ] [ PANTS ] Okay , it 's your turn . Wait a minute . Who are you ? I 'm the emperor . Thanks for crying me out . You 're welcome . FRY : Oh ! Ooh ! Aw ! Ow ! BENDER : Save some for me .

 Crichton : It 's always the same here , Dad . Nice and quiet . Zhaan : Chiana , what is this ? Chiana : I don 't know . Zhaan : Look at it , please . - Well maybe it 's your ... - lt 's my Bassim Oil . What ? I didn 't take it . I found it in your chamber , dear . Well maybe it ... okay , so I took it . Arrest me . Look Chiana , when we agreed to let you stay on Moya ... - And if you leave it out again , I 'll take it again ! - you promised to adapt to our ways . I changed my mind . You adapt to me . Chiana ! I 've changed my mind ! Yeah , it 's always the same here , Dad . Nice and quiet . ( sighs ) lt 's late . Well , it 's space. I don 't really know what time it is . It 's , uh ... I miss the sun , days , nights . Simple things . Anyway , I , um ... I wanted to tell you about this thing . I 'm holding it right now . It 's ... it 's my first gray hair . You know , I wouldn 't mention it . It 's just that ... I 'm afraid I might be growing old out here . Pilot : John Crichton . You 'd better get up here . I can 't deal with this . ( engine slows ) Why have the engines stopped ? Okay , Pilot , I 'm here . What 's the problem this time ? Moya hasn 't sensed anything like this since the day you arrived . Pilot , how long has that been there ? It just appeared on my scanners , but it 's already breaking apart . Stability 's down to 80 % . What are you up to , Crichton ? Rygel , do you see this ? Do you see this ? Chiana : What is that ? Rygel : That is a pathetic little waste funnel of which I care little about . We 're supposed to be on our way to the commerce planet , where l believe they have Hynerian marjols . is he the captain ? Because if he 's not the captain , then how does he get to stop the ship ? That is a wormhole . Rygel : Yeah , yeah , now restart the engines , if you please . What if I wanted to stop the ship ? Crichton , look at this . Oh my God . Rygel : What ? It 's just a tiny blue planet . What are you getting so worked up about ? Oh , it 's got no particle rings , no red moons . Chiana : Totally unimpressive . That 's Earth . That 's my home . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . You 're going now ? Yeah . Pilot says we 're running out of time . I can 't go with you . Aeryn , this could be our only chance . No , this is youronly chance . I 'm not certain I 'll belong there . You would . You will. I promise . I 'm sorry . Crichton , wormhole stability down to 57 % . I 'm on my way . That wormhole could blast you out anywhere . I know . Pilot says it 's unsafe and it could ... lt could kill me , Zhaan. I know . You 've given me every good reason not to go . I could end up dead , I could end up more lost than I already am . You 've given me every single thing except one . What ? This could be Earth . This is the way I got here , through a wormhole . It could be my way home . I 've got to do this , Zhaan . Look , however this works out , this could be goodbye . And I know that you , ah , didn 't expect me to be here , but thanks . You saved my life . All of you . Pilot : Crichton . Stability down to 48 % . Yeah , I 'm going , Pilot . Goodbye , big guy . I , ah , hope you get your chance one day . You go see your son . I hope so too . Goodbye , John . John Crichton , remember , there 's a part of me inside you . Take care of it . I will . Sparky . What ? I 'm not taking my stuff . Mmm ? So I thought I 'd give it to somebody . Hmm . To Aeryn . No ! No , you can 't do that ... ( Rygel laughing ) Goodbye . Pilot : 39 % stability . I 'm doing this as fast as I can , Pilot . Pilot : You 're almost at entry vector . Just a little more . Now ! Go now , Crichton . Entry angle confirmed . Go ! What 's the matter with him ? Rygel : Just go , you lucky prabakto . Go . Crichton . Yeah , D 'Argo ? I understand the fear . If you don 't do this now , you will regret it forever . You must go now . Do it , John . Thirty-four percent . Crichton : Thanks , big guy . Okay . Give me some luck . John , can you hear me ? Pilot , are you reading anything from him ? He 's off my sensors . He 's gone . Pilot , are you tracking me ? Pilot ? ( loud beeping ) ( loud roar ) ( laughing ) Hello , sky ! Excuse me . Miss , I know this is this is going to sound insane , but this is Australia , right ? What ? Hey ! Guys , where you been ? Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Wait. I 'm John Crichton . ( gunshot ) ( panting ) Man : Let 's go again . So why did you land in Australia ? I didn 't land . I crashed . And what is your mission here ? What are you talking about ? I don 't have a mission . Have you been here before ? I 'm John Crichton . You know that , Wilson . What ? You-you-you think I 'm an alien ? ( chuckles ) Have you been here before ? Australia ? Yeah . Three times . You were here with me last year when I tested the Farscape 's engines , Wilson . So what the hell is going on ? ! ( speaking african dialect ) This is the 12th guy , Wilson . How many more are you going to roll in here before you believe these are translator microbes in my head and not some space virus ? What did he say ? Well , I think he said that ... until he gets some answers he 's not going to play anymore . Hey , Cobb , when am I getting out of here ? I don 't know . You don 't know . Can I get a newspaper ? Oh , come on , Cobb ! What am I going to find out ? I mean ... Look , I 've been away for , what would you say , seven months ? I just want to know what 's happened , something since I 've been gone . Who won the Super Bowl , Cobb ? I don 't know . I know you 're Australian , Cobb , but you 've got to know who won the Super Bowl . You know who Ty Cobb is , Cobb ? No ? How about Babe Ruth ? You know who Babe Ruth is ? Some fat guy that played for the Yankees . Good . Fat guy . At least you know something . You 're kidding me . This is how he described them ? Guard : I 'm sorry , sir , there 's no access . Stop , sir . - Out of my way . - This is a restricted area , sir . Back off , soldier . Kill that switch . Crichton : Dad ! I 've waited two days . I want to see him . I want to see my son now . Jack , that 's what we 're trying to determine . Whether it is your son . What have you done to him ? He 's got foreign microbes in his brain stem , and the Farscape module has been modified by non-human technology . You know how this works , Colonel . Once we 've confirmed John poses no threat , then you can see him . I don 't buy that. I want to see him now . Dad . Get me out of here , please . I need to ask you some questions . What happened on your tenth birthday ? What ? Tenth birthday ? I don 't know . I can 't remember . We were living in Annapolis . Annapolis . Right . You were late . Again . Why ? You said ... you said they held you in Houston for tests . You missed your flight . But you commandeered a jet and you came anyway . I woke you up at four o 'clock in the morning . You took me fishing . At Sawyer 's Mill . And you caught the biggest damn bass I 'd ever seen . It was a trout , Dad . Yeah , it was a trout . I missed you , son . Crichton : What 's going on ? I know recovery procedure as well as anyone . This is way beyond routine . Nothing 's been routine since the day you left seven months ago . That wormhole you went through is still there . You opened a door , son . A door to Earth we don 't know how to close . ( whispers ) : Get me out of here . Jack : Believe I will . Crichton : I don 't buy this , Dad . Jack : What ? Wilson , letting me out . There 's no way he 'd let me out of his sight if what you say is true . You know Wilson ? Yeah . Know Cobb , too . He hasn 't let you out of his sight , son . See that van in the parking lot ? Those two women to our right ? The one in the red with the headphones , you know , sunning herself on the rocks ? Yeah , yeah , I see them . They 're watching us . They like to get real close . ( radio static ) Listen . A global alliance has been set up to track the wormhole . Ray Wilson 's been put in charge by the Pentagon . What the hell does he want from me ? He wants you to relax so that I can tell whether or not you 're really my son . Then he wants to know everything you know about the wormhole and everything you saw on the other side . Oh , give me a break , Dad . I 'll tell him everything . You know that . I know that . I kept that safe for you . Don 't know if it brought me luck , but it saved my ass . You know , when you disappeared in Farscape One , I ... had to deal with the possibility that you might not be alive . Well , now you know . Now you know how I felt as a kid every time you went on a mission . Come on , son . We 've got a lot of work to do . ( Crichton chewing ) : They have worlds out there , people out there that you wouldn 't believe . But they do not have chocolate . Hang on a second . Hey , no . Don 't do it like that . It 's a propulsion fin . It 's part of the hetch drive , okay ? Yes , sir . Deja vu . Have we met ? Yes , sir . Last year in the Simpson Desert , when you were down there for the shuttle tests . You were with Cobb , right ? Yes , sir . Right . Well , it 's , um ... it 's good to see you again . Sir ! What 's going on ? Cobb : Strat Comm from Sector Three , sir . Something else has come through the wormhole . Bring him ! What do we got ? Cobb : There 's an unidentified ship tracking in on the same trajectory as the Farscape module . F-16s are scrambling for a visual . Are they here for you ? - What ? - Are they here to save you ? - l don 't ... - Who is it ? ! Who is that ? ! Look , I can 't see ... Who is it ? ! Who 's on first ! What 's on second ! I don 't know ! I can 't see them ! F-16s locked and ready . Crichton : Wait ! That 's Moya 's Transport Pod . Tell them not to fire . Are they here to attack us ? No , they 're not here to harm us , Wilson . Just tell them not to fire . That 's not my call , Crichton . Tell them , Wilson ! They don 't have any weapons on board the transport ! Tell them not to fire ! Tell them not to fire . After you left , your Earth disappeared through the wormhole . It was her idea to see what was going on ... Wilson : What are they saying , Crichton ? ( Rygel speaking Hynerian ) ( Aeryn speaking Sebacean ) There was nothing I could do . ( low grumbling ) Crichton : Rygel , you okay ? No. I 'm frelling sick . What are they saying ? They 're scared , Wilson . That 's what they 're saying . I 'm not scared. I 'm sick . What the yotz did you give me ? ( hissing ) Jack : Son , are you okay in there ? I 'm fine . ( D 'Argo growling ) lt 's the tranquilizer , Rygel . That 's what 's making you sick . It 'll wear off soon . You 're going to be okay . ( Rygel speaking ) Crichton : They 're freaking out . You 're an alien and they 're freaking out . I vowed I would never be taken prisoner again . You 're not a prisoner . Trust me . I 'm going to take care of you guys . Rygel : Crichton , I feel frellingterrible . Yeah. I 'm going to get someone in here for you , Rygel . ( knocks ) ( door opening ) What 's going on ? What 's taking so long ? - Relax , son . - And do what , Dad ? Read a magazine ? They 're all seven months old , Dad . They don 't want me to have any idea what 's going on . If what you say about those aliens is true , they can help us unlock the universe . You 're positive they 're not here to harm us ? No . They came looking for me . They were worried . You trust them ? A lot more than I trust Wilson . I like ' em , Dad . They 're my friends . Sir , we need you in the medical unit . What 's the matter ? I think you should see this . Wilson ! We spent our lives waiting for this moment . We sent Voyager . We left damn greeting cards on the moon and as soon as I get here , look at what you 're doing . They can help us . Just take a step back and you look at what you 're doing . You think about it . Don 't worry. I 've thought of everything , Commander . You make me sick ! Official word is Rygel died from an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer . What do you think happened ? It doesn 't matter what I think , D 'Argo . No , I think they killed him . You know that those animals killed him . Then they cut him open . They said they were just trying to restart his heart . They were studying him like an animal . Like an alien . Which one of us do you think they 'll kill next , Crichton ? D 'Argo , it 's not going to go down like that . Look , I know that you have no reason to trust me ... You 're right ! I don 't trust you . But you tell those humans that when they come for me , I 'll kill them . D 'Argo , don 't ... We 've tried it your way and one of us is dead . Go . Aeryn ? You know , Crichton , Peacekeepers wouldn 't even kill their prisoners to study them . D 'Argo 's right . Just go . Let me out of here . Son . I gave them my word , Dad . I told them I 'd take care of them . You were naive to think you could protect them from people like Wilson . I need a favor , Dad . Name it . I want you to call in every marker that you have . Every General , every Undersecretary , every Pentagon mistress . You tell them what 's going on here and you get them to stop it . What are you going to do , son ? I 'm just going to plead with Wilson . I 'm going to beg for their lives . No , no. I know that look , John . You be careful . I 'm just going to make him understand , Dad . Son , are you willing to die for those creatures in there ? I gave my word . Did I kill him ? No . Are you with me ? Or them ? I 'm with you . Aeryn . Trust me . Put down the gun . They know you 're out ? They took D 'Argo somewhere . When the guard came back for me I was ready for him . Where 'd they take him ? I don 't know , but I 'm not waiting for them to come back . All right then . Let 's move . Hey , Cobb . You find out who won the Super Bowl yet ? What do you want , Crichton ? ( Aeryn speaks in Sebacean ) What is she doing here ? ( Aeryn speaks in Sebacean ) What did she say ? She says she wants to shoot you , Cobb . I don 't know if it 's a good idea or not , but I figure since you 've pushed us this far it doesn 't really matter , does it ? Where 's D 'Argo ? They flew him to another base . He 's gone , Crichton . You can 't save him . If you 'd only been reasonable . You 're wrong in what you 're doing here , Cobb . You 're wrong . You 're not going to shoot me , are you ? You 're wrong . That 's for Rygel . Aeryn , pick it up. I want to get out of this rain . This is the place . Rain . is that what you call this ? I like it . Aeryn ! Why this place ? My Dad and I stayed here last year . He said we could use it as a safe house . Your father told you about this place ? Yeah . Crichton , he is with them . This is the first place they will look for us . I don 't think so . I trust him . Ladies first . ( distant thunder ) ( thunder continues ) So what 's this ? It 's beer . Alcohol . Trust me , it 's just what we need right now . Down the hatch . Down the hatch . You like it ? Yes . It 's like Fellip nectar . A Fellip 's a creature on Tarsis and they get the nectar from ... Aeryn , please . Don 't tell me where it comes from . Just drink the beer . Sorry . What for ? Everything . What 's happened here , getting you stuck on Moya . I mean , if it wasn 't for me , you 'd still be the happy little Peacekeeper dominating the lesser races . Hmm . I 've got a lot to blame you for , Crichton . Look at that . What ? That 's it . Earth . ( distant siren wailing ) Minus the sunshine . You know , you were right . It 's actually very beautiful . ( thunder rumbling ) Were you scared to join me , when I left Moya ? Yes . I won 't be recaptured , Crichton . They will have to kill me if they come to take me tomorrow . I know . ( birds chirping ) ( John moaning ) Get out of bed , John . Ohhhh ... Morning . Come on. I 've worked out that plan we talked about . Aeryn , um , about last night . Yes , it 's fine John. lt 's just not top priority right now . I 've gone through all of these pictures and I 've found a few places that seem to be uninhabited enough to hide in . Aeryn . You 're right . We , um , we have to find a place to hide . Let 's go . No , you 're not going anywhere dressed like that . You sure about this ? You look fine . We got ... ( knocking at door ) Jack : John ? It 's my father . I knew it . He 's betrayed us . There 'll be soldiers outside . No , he won 't. I trust him . I don 't . Are you okay , son ? Yeah . Remember Aeryn Sun ? We actually never met . Hak nyatse . What 's she saying ? He doesn 't have a gun . Hak nyatse ! I 'm not going to search him . is she ever going to put that down ? I don 't think so . What are you doing here ? Does Wilson know you 're here ? No . It 's not going to take them long to start searching places we 've been before . Did you talk to anybody for us ? Everybody . No one 's going to help us , son . It 's too dangerous . And what about you ? I don 't matter in this . Official word is that these aliens never existed . D 'Argo 's on his way to a military base in Utah and the warehouse has been swept clean . ( Aeryn speaks in Sebacean ) Aeryn ! Back off . Please . Listen . The two of you have to get out of town . You 've got to find someplace that 's safe . I 'll hold them off here as long as I can . No . No , I don 't want you to cover for me . This is the only play , son . You 're in this too deep . They 're not going to let you just walk away . Look . At least this time I get to say goodbye . Oh well , um ... we 'll hole up somewhere , and I 'll , uh , contact you . No . If I know anything , they 'll try to make me tell ' em . You just go . Goodbye , Dad . ( Aeryn speaks in Sebacean ) Thank you , Aeryn Sun . Why is everyone looking at me ? That 's ' cause they think you look good . Aeryn : What ? That girl . She was on the beach the other day , when I crash landed . That one . So ? I think I know her. I think ... we went to high school together . It was only for a couple of weeks . We never talked , but ... Yeah , yeah . She looks familiar . ( chuckles ) Hey , can I help you , mate ? They 're all seven months old . Why are they all seven months old ? John , stop it . I 've seen all these before . They 're from when I left ! What are you doing , John ? I know you , don 't I ? What ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ! You 're the guy on the beach the other day ! Shh ! Just keep your voice down . I used to ride my bike past your house in the fifth grade . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I 've never seen you before in my life . Everybody here , Aeryn . I know them all . I know Wilson , I know Cobb , I know you ! John , stop it . Keep your voice down . What are you doing ? I know everyone ! Get away from me , Aeryn . Get away ! Back off ! Every place I 've been , I 've been there before . Every place . Frank Cokonis ! I dated your sister ! Yeah ! Here we go ! Ha-ha ! This is exactly the way I remember it . I know all you guys , don 't I ? It 's a little out of context . But I know you . How the hell you been ? Quit . Now what the hell are you doing here ? Yeah , I 've been here . Been in there . Nothing new . But I 've never been in there . - Sir ? - Stop ! Make me . You 're not going to shoot . You 're not even Wilson . Where 's the female alien ? I 'm going to talk to the man in charge and we both know it ain 't you . Who are you ? You did well , John . Most species don 't do as well . What is all this ? Everything here is a physical creation from your memory . But you 're not real . Well ... I 'm not your father . And what about my friends ? They 're real . Living matter . They were investigating the wormhole we 'd created from your memory . So we decided to use them in our trial . D 'Argo : Crichton . Enough is enough . D 'Argo ! Get us back home . Ry ... Rygel . They didn 't kill you . Rygel : Kill me ? ( laughs ) These people treated me splendidly . They gave me marjols , Crichton . Lovely Hynerian marjols . Mmm ... ( munching ) Whoever you are , I thank you ! Of course we didn 't kill him . We created his corpse . Why ? Why would you make me think that he was dead ? We needed a human reaction , John . Your reaction . You made me think you were my father ! I 'm sorry . For the trial to have value you had to believe everything . Let me show you . Are we anywhere near Earth ? Actually , we 're not far from Moya . We brought you here to recreate your memory . But if you can make all this , why not just make a wormhole to take you to Earth ? That would use all our remaining power . We only have enough left to transport our race one last time . We had to be certain of how we 'd be received . Though space is without boundaries there are but a few planets where we can live . So you 're looking to take over someone else 's ? Not take over . Cohabitate . To replenish our hive . The ancients have stories of a world that will welcome us . We can only hope they 're true . You can move closer . Thanks . I 'm close enough . We had to find out whether humans would welcome us or fight us . You stole my memories . I 'm sorry to have taken this form , but I thought the best spy would be a father , as seen through his son 's eyes . You stole my memories . We had no choice . Show me what you really look like . Many of us hoped that Earth might be our welcoming place . If all people were like you , maybe it could be . But they 're not . In your memory , we saw millions of Wilsons and Cobbs . It also led us to a familiar conclusion . Which was ? That the highest life form on the planet is also the most destructive . Your humans would kill us . So , what will you do now ? What we 've done since before I was hatched . We continue searching for a home . So will I . Here . Thanks . Maybe we 'll meet again one day , John . Maybe .

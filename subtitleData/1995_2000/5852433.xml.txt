 Where 'd that come from ? - What in God 's name are you doing ? - Nothing . You 're spying on the whole neighborhood , aren 't you ? It 's ... security . My own personal high-tech neighborhood watch . Since when do thieves break into people 's bathrooms ? Wait a minute . That 's my bathroom . Don 't be such a pride . Hey , by the way , nice action with the loofah . Hey . Check out Gary . Eww ! Lis , Lis , this is wrong . You shouldn 't eavesdrop . It 's an invasion of privacy- - not to mention you might hear something that you shouldn 't and ... Is that my mother ? So I looked him straight in the eye , and I said " Marharishi , - I will if you will . " - [ all laughing ] Oh , my , my empty . Oh , fellas , please . You can carry the glass you can pour and you ? You can count the bubbles . So , Marcia , what do you hear about our new neighbor Ms. White ? You mean Neve ? Well , I hate to gossip but I hear she 's never been married she lives alone with her cat and she 's a high school guidance counselor . Add that up and I 'm not sure what you get but I think it rhymes with " old braid ' ? - [ doorbell chimes ] - Oh , speak of the devil . I 'll get that , dear . Seriously , we should all be kind and just welcome her with open arms . Just treat her the way you would treat ... - WAYNE : My new neighbor Neve . - Champagne ? ... me . WYATT : Ooh , I know that look . Dad 's in big trouble . This is great ! Everyone at the party tonight was certainly taken with Neve . Mm-hmm . Do you think I should wear my air like hers ? Um ... sure . Oh , so you think she 's prettier than me ? I never said that . Well , you said her hair was better than mine . Okay . I see where this is going . Look , why don 't I just save us both a lot of time - and head on out to the couch now ? - Oh , wait , honey . You don 't have to leave . You know , I 'm still a little tipsy from the champagne . I 've got to catch a plane in six hours . I need the sleep . But ... Man , how can Mom feel old and unattractive ? - She 's still pretty ? - Hey , you 're asking the wrong genie . I don 't find the human form very appealing to begin with . What ? You evolved one step too far for my taste . Monkeys- - they got it going on . Huh ? Where do you think they got the expression " hot monkey love " ? Lisa , I want you to make my mom feel young and pretty again . Sure . I am going to zap your mom 's mirror- - boom . So when she looks into it she see herself as young and pretty and feels good right here . - Got it ? - Got it . Hmm . Maybe I 'll skip that mudpack tonight . Lis , we done good . She 's happier already . - Thanks . - No sweat . Now , could you stop snooping ? I would like to go to bed . Okay . Am I the sexiest lady in town or what ? MIRROR : Not yet ... my Queen . But by the time I finish with you they will all bow down to your ... beau-tay ? [ laughter ] Oh ... Do go on . Mm-mm-mm . Baby , you look good today . Before I 'm through , you are gonna be the foxiest female on the dance floor . Gonna be ? Gonna be ? - Mm-hmm . - Oh , I see your problem . [ blowing ] Better now ? Well , smell her . Wake-up call , Queenie . You ain 't the finest piece of China yet . - Well , then who the hell is ? - There 's a whole flock of she-gulls out there who struck it rich in the DNA Lotto . And most of them can 't imagine life before MTV . All these girls are younger and prettier ? I can 't complete with all that . Chill , baby . I said I 'd take care of it , didn 't I ? And the mirror always keeps his promise , right ? You just need a few accessories . Now , you see that , uh , ruby red down there ? You want someone out of the beauty pageant , right ? Now , you take that pucker paint and give her the " no smoking " sign . [ laughing heartily ] Goodbye , Miss Congeniality . [ laughing ] And I know just where to start . I 'm telling you- - this Ms. White is Ms White not . That 's what I 've been saying since we were freshman . You want me to visit the guidance counselor give me some incentive . I think my academic career needs a long , slow counseling session . MARCIA : Pity . She was so young and beautiful . - Ms. White ? - Ms. White ? Where 'd she go ? [ evil laughter ] Man , this is the worst day of school I ever had . No kidding ? First we miss coping a peek at Ms White . Then second period , Jeannie Burns is gone . That was okay . I slept . But last period there were no girls at all . I actually had to pay attention . Come to think of it Gina Brown was out last period , too . [ chattering ] Well , at least you can count on the cheerleaders for that midmorning lift . Whoo ! The blood just left my head . Lisa ? Lisa . Lisa , something weird is going on at ... ! [ snickering ] It 's Candyland . Oh , oh , ooh ... for years I 've only been undressing them with my eyes . Don 't even think about it . Now , look , we 've got to find Lisa and fix this before Mom comes home . Oh , but I am home . - [ evil laughter ] - [ thunderclap ] - Mom ? - Eww . You will address me as " Highness ... " or " Queen . " " Your Loveliness " would be nice , but not " Mom . " Well , what do you think ? - Shouldn 't you ... - Be at work ? My work surrounds you . Don 't you like it ? [ stammering ] It 's nice , but it 's be better if they were naked . - [ buzzing ] - Whoops . Soon there will be none left fairer than I. Uh ... Mom ? I 'm sorry . Highness-- - you , uh , you can 't go around turning people into statues . So you don 't approve ? You think I 've made a mistake ? Well , perhaps I 'll make another mistake- - perhaps two more mistakes . Would this be a good time to flee in terror ? I 'm right behind you . I have done as you instructed . Am I now the tastiest tart on the desert try ? Honey , you kill ! [ giggling ] ... but the mirror cannot tell a lie . There 's still one more Stone Fox in the Chicken Coop . Well ... then let 's be rid of her . Ain 't going ot be that easy , babe . This one 's got magic of her own . Who is this evil sorceress that I have yet to vanquish ? Behold ! [ gasps ] But don 't you worry . Miss magical things has an achilles ' heal and I know how to get her pumps off . [ evil laughter ] WOMAN 1 : So you want to meet him at the salad bar ? WOMAN 2 : Yeah . I 'd love to . MAN 1 : He told you about the treasure and then he died ? MAN 2 : Kicked the bucket . Well , where 'd he bury it ? Underneath a big " W , " Santa Rosita , California and the big " W " is a ... - [ static ] - Oh ... that makes me ... so mad . Mad , mad , mad . MARCIA : Young lady ... Young lady , are you interested in sampling some free ice cream ? Free ice cream ? As in ice cream I don 't even have to pay for ? Would I. Wait a second . Why would anyone just give away ice cream ? Oh , not just any ice cream . Super chunky chango- - double fat , double cream , double delicious . I don 't know . I shouldn 't really take something in an open container from a complete stranger . But it comes with this cute little wooden spoon . Ooh , gimme . Mmm . [ evil laughter ] [ thunderclap ] Stop pushing me . I 'm not going back in there while Satan 's daughter ... - Sorry . - ... your mom is still on the loose . We have to . We need Lisa , and we can 't find her . We have to get to my computer and call her up the old-fashioned way . Hope I remember the password . - Wasn 't it , " Lisa " ? - Oh , yeah . Ooh ... " Double cream , double fat . " Lisa wouldn 't leave a pint of this lying around . Something is horribly , horribly wrong . This is great . My life is a twisted fairy tale . My mom 's a wicked witch , and my genie 's in a deep freeze . If this were Disney movie now I 'd sing a moving ballad ot a cup . It is a fairy tale- - Like " Snow White . " That means we can wake Lisa up with a kiss . Hot dog . Here , bud . Oh , oh , oh , oh . Hold on . Only a kiss from a prince can awaken Snow White . I 'm the son of the Queen- - Evil Queen . I 'm still a prince . Step aside . Maybe you were adopted . Maybe I 'm not the right prince . Maybe we ... - Oh , hell . - What ? We need the Queen 's first-born . Chett ? You want Chett to kiss her ? It 's worth a shot . Come on , come on . It was a mistake to return . [ evil laughter ] Your mom 's kind of hot when she does that . Prepare to be transformed into my manservants . Dwarfs . She 's going ot turn us into dwarfs . [ chuckling ] : Oh , goodness no . Dwarfs ? I 've never heard anything quite so ludicrous . I 'm turning you into winged monkeys . Whoo ! Something is funky in cheektown . I think she got me . I think she got us both . - Do I have a tail ? - Yup . You 're not going to be too thrilled about your shiny red butt either . Huh ? Ohh ! Psst ! Chett , come here ! Chett ! [ snorts ] Holy monkeys . - We 're in big trouble . - We need your help . Oh , back up , chim-chim . I 'm attached ot my smooth , creamy , human backside . You two can solve your own little problems . The tails move ? Hey , outstanding . What do I do to get one ? Just follow me . Hey , a quarter . Hey , can you open a beer can with one of those ? WYATT : Go on , Chett , kiss her . You don 't have to tell me twice . Stand back and watch these princely lips ... work their magic . What 's the problem ? You 're not being charming . Princes are supposed to be charming . Gotcha . Charm . I can do charm . Lisa , without you ... the moon has lost its luster the flowers refuse to bloom . Lisa , bless us once again with the radiance of your smile . - Crap . - Will she ever wake up ? - I don 't know . - Wake up , will you ? There 's stuff I never got to tell you . Important stuff . Deep stuff . You know ? Stuff . What kind of stuff ? You were faking ? ! You were awake already ? ! Yup . First kiss did it . - Heard everything . - I didn 't mean a word of it . - So there . - Did , too . - Did not . - Hello ? Evil Queen in the master bedroom . - You guys look great . - Yeah , yeah . No , I mean it . Both of you . Absolutely great . They look like monkeys . - Don 't I know it . - Woof ! Lis ! We got to stop my mom ! Anything you say . So ... you have broke my spell , turned my sons against me and are intent on my destruction . Now we will see whose magic is the stronger . Okay , zap-hag . You want to fight ? Let 's go . # Get busy , get busy ! # Our magic is as great as mine . It takes more than firepower to win a hoodoo showdown . It requires experience ... cleverness and lightning-fast refleves . Oh ? I 'll try to keep that in mind . Crisp . Hey . Magic mirror- - eat hot paperweight . - Didn 't hurt ! - What happened ? The magic 's grown too strong . Marcia 's the only one who can break the mirror now . And a fat chance at that . So now young magic genie you will die ! You think getting rid of Lisa will make you the fairest in all the land but you 're wrong ! Beauty isn 't how you look . It 's what you are and you 've got what counts- - Experience , wisdom ... Yeah , Mr. D. You got everything- - A career , a loving husband two kids that look up to you . Marcia , please . I know you 're not evil . You can 't be . You 're my mom . She 's a Queen , you little fool why would she settle to be your silly ass mother . - When she could be so much more . - Silly ass ? How dare you . What I do is not silly ass . I have dedicated my life to the welfare of my children . If you 're not beautiful , you 're nothing . You need me to make you beautiful . No ! I don 't need squat from you . [ screaming ] Oh ! Wyatt ? Chett ? What happened ? I must have blacked out or something . How do you feel , Mom ? Young . I feel young . I feel as though all my insecurities have just melted away . Who 's she ? For me ? Please ? We 're not letting you zap us back into monkeys . Just the bottom half . I 'll make it worth your while . - No . - No . Hey , Lis . Want to see a movie ? - You got to be kidding . - That 's pretty pathetic . So ... what 's playing ? Captioned by Grant Brown

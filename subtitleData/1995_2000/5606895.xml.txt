 Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff ? Well , it 's very simple . In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose , I 'm the smart one , Wolowitz is the funny one , and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails . That leaves you , by default , as the muscle . One more floor , and I 'd be the pulled muscle . It 's about time . I 'm starving . Well , we didn 't actually get Chinese food . - Why not ? - Don 't panic . This is better . No . You didn 't trade the food for magic beans , did you ? Of course not . And technically , magic beans would be food . Although eating them would be quite a waste , since you could plant them , and overnight , have a giant beanstalk , which would provide enough roughage for a small city . Yeah , sometimes I don 't listen . Sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down . We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West , so we followed him . Who 's Adam West ? Leonard , what do the two of you talk about after the coitus ? My guess is , " Hey , four minutes ! New record ! " That 's why I 'm the funny one . Anyway , we followed the guy to this garage sale , and they had the coolest stuff . They were closing up . We got this whole box for 60 bucks . We didn 't even get to go through it all . There could be anything in here . There a new girlfriend in there ? 'Cause you might need one . No . But there is an original final draft " Ghostbusters " script with actual slime stains ! You 're right . It 's " Ghostbusters 2 " . Never mind . My God . An Alf doll . When I was 11 , my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left . I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac , and Alf was going to bring him back to me . But he never did . Where 's my daddy , puppet ? Where is he ? That is so sad . No , what 's sad is that you don 't know Adam West was TV 's Batman . The Big Bang Theory 2x17 - The Precious fragmentation Here 's Spock 's head with no body . Here 's Mr. T 's body with no head . Yeah , here 's Spock 's body with Mr. T 's head . I pity the fool who 's illogical . Okay , I 'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony . Okay , bye . Okay . Look , an Indiana Jones " Connect-the-dots " . And an Aquaman action figure . Looks like someone drew a penis on him . That 'll come off . You see what you 're doing ? Stop that . Fascinating . What ? It appears to be a " Lord of the Rings " ring . It 's even got the Elvish engraving on it . It 's not Elvish . It 's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script . " One Ring to rule them all " . " One Ring to find them " . " One Ring to bring them all " . " And in the darkness bind them " . Holy crap , are we nerdy . So , I was doing some checking on the ring . Hold on . Sheldon , is there ketchup on that table ? Yes , there is . Here 's a fun fact . Ketchup started out as a general term for sauce , typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices . Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry , anchovy , oyster , kidney bean and grape . No , that 's okay . I 'll get it . Listen , I was looking at the ring , and it seemed a little weird . No copyright notice on it . So , I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with ... shall we say , the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world . Seedy underbelly ? You know , your black market phasers , your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties , that kind of stuff . Who 's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have ? Just a guy . I know a guy . Is it Eddie Crispo ? No , I can 't tell you who it is . Stop asking . Who else could it be ? It has to be Eddie Crispo . I know lots of dangerous people , okay ? - Name one . - Eddie Crispo . Anyway , he said this isn 't a replica . It 's the real deal . If you 're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom , I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement . He 's not saying it 's a magic ring . You 're not , are you ? No , but it 's close . Look at the markings inside . Those are production markings . Nine rings were made for use in the " Lord of the Rings " movies . Three were given to members of the cast . The rest were destroyed . Except one . One was stolen . Gentlemen ... this is the one ring . Mine ! No , it is not yours . We all went in on the box together . Well , yes , but I found it in the box , and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure . How is this maritime salvage ? Other than the lack of water , how is it not ? Wait , wait . Sheldon , stop being crazy for a second . How much is something like this worth ? Well , it 's tough to say since it 's hot , but on the underground market , my guy figures ... Your guy Eddie Crispo ? Yes . He figures ten , maybe 15 thousand . Okay , that 's a lot of money . The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical . Like a jet ski . Why do you want a jet ski ? All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis . That can 't just be a coincidence . We can 't sell it . We have to keep it and love it and polish it , and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and reenact our favorite scenes from the movies . It 's sad how great that sounds . Guys , it 's stolen . It should go back to Peter Jackson . He made the movies ; it belongs to him . Fine . He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie . There are no Jewish hobbits . Clearly , you 've never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah . We are not blackmailing Peter J ... All right , where 's the ring ? You mean my ring ? What are you doing ? The ring was unguarded . It was just sitting on the table . Anyone could have taken it . Proof ? I did . - Give me that . - Look , let 's be reasonable . We all want to do different things with the ring , but your ideas are stupid , and I want a jet ski . I found it . The ring is mine . I don 't understand why in this group I never get my way . You always get your way . I 'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring . Hey , guys . Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food , but bringing you a box of random crap ? Yeah , it 's delicious . The sarcasm 's a little stale , though . Hey , how about this ? Until we figure out what to do with the ring , Penny holds on to it . What ring ? This ring . Looking for something ? Will you hold on to this for a couple of days ? - Why ? - It 's a prop from a movie , and we 're kind of fighting over it . Okay , just to be clear , the first piece of jewelry my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie , and I don 't even get to keep it ? If you had gone out with me three years ago , by now , you 'd have my great Aunt Ida 's brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat . How am I looking now ? You hit me ! I 'm bleeding ! What was that ? Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him . That 's my girl . So , Sheldon , how 's it feel to get beaten up by a girl ? It 's not the first time . I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero . If only I 'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her , then I 'd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter . Gentlemen , have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money ? No . I was afraid of that . Go ahead . Greetings from Mumbai . I am Raj 's attorney , Venkatesh Koothrappali . Also my cousin . You brought a lawyer ? Don 't answer that . I 'll get straight to the point . My client 's prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis . We 're not giving him two Jet Skis . Look , we 're big boys , why don 't we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle ? One Kawasaki Jet Ski . Done and done . No Jet Skis . All right , forget the Jet Skis . Forget the Jet Skis ? That was our line in the sand ! What happened to " tear them a new one ? " What can I say ? They played hardball . We lost . You 're useless . I told you that when you hired me . I 'm signing off now . Call your mother . She worries . Okay , just so you know , if we 're bringing in cousins who are lawyers , prepare for shock and awe . You know what ? I am ending this . Penny didn 't want to hold the ring anymore . She gave it to me . I have it . I 'm sending it back . Where 's the ring ? You mean this ring ? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men 's room . Give me that . No , it 's mine . It 's all of ours . - Okay , now , this is ridiculous ! - Then let go ! I 'm not letting go . You let go . I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on . Fine . But can 't we go home and start this ? Sure . Let go of the ring . All right , it starts now . You do realize there 's a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the SyFy Channel . Wait , my laptop . You know , there 's a point when this becomes idiotic . And it wasn 't when we were driving like this ? I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile . I have endless patience . I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service . You want to talk about endless patience ? Penny made me watch all five seasons of " Sex and the City " . There are six seasons , dude . Crap ! No , no , no , the sixth season is great . We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken , and then Mr. Big shows up , we don 't know if we can trust him again . It 's a wild ride . Door . Okay , everybody , and plié . And relevé . Whatcha doin ' ? Last one holding the ring decides its fate . I know , it sounds silly . No , no , no , no , no , you are my boyfriend . Nothing you do is silly to me . Thank you . FYI , this is a bag from Victoria 's Secret . I 'm out . I 'm sorry , Ma , I have to stay late at the office . No , he 's doesn 't ! He 's lying to you ! Will you be quiet ? Well , if you want privacy let go of the ring . I 'm so glad we came to this gentile strip club ! Howard , here 's more bacon to tuck into the shiksa 's G-string ! I 'll call you back . I think it 's lovely you call your mommy and let her know you 're going to be late for dinner . From what I know about these things , if a woman doesn 't breast-feed on time , it 's very uncomfortable for her boobies . Don 't you talk about my mother 's boobies ! If you 're offended , let go of the ring and go on home to your mother 's boobies . Excellent , excellent . Tire each other out , the ring will be mine . Howard , why don 't you go after Raj 's mother ? Why don 't we go after your mother ? Go ahead . I have no illusions about my mother . She is a kind , loving , religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr Pepper addiction . Anything you 'd like to add ? That 's not gonna get you anywhere . Better pull out the big gun . You 're right . Let 's talk about your grandmother . No ! I call no Meemaws . Think about this . The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex . I don 't want to hear this . Then let go of the ring and walk away . Never . All right . I 'll bet your Meemaw didn 't just have sex to have your mother . I bet she had sex because she liked it . Stop it ! Yeah , Meemaw did the nasty . I said stop it ! We 're getting to him . Waterfalls ! What ? Waterfalls . Crashing waves . Babbling brooks . What are you doing ? Subliminal messaging . I 'm going to make you want to pee . Dripping faucets . Leaky gutter . Peeing . It 's not working , dude . It 's working all right . I have to pee . Then let go of the ring and go . No , actually , I wouldn 't mind going , too . Fine . On the count of three . One , two ... Wait , just to clarify . When you get to three , do we stand up or do we pee ? We stand up . Excellent choice . Three . Something tells me this was a bad day to wear Suede shoes . I 've done it ! I 've won ! The ring is mine ! It 's mine ! We 're going to clean it up and make it pretty . My own . My love . My Precious . Where 's the ring ? It 's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from . The fires of Mount Doom ? Peter Jackson 's office in New Zealand . It wasn 't ours . You quit the game ! You had no right to take it . I came in here , you guys were all sleeping . The ring was on the floor . No one was touching it . Well , so then we start the game over until there 's a winner . There wasn 't ever going to be a winner . There was going to be a selfish , petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend . Is that really what you guys want ? 'Cause if it is , fine . I don 't want anything to do with you . And I don 't know what happened i that bathroom , but I am not cleaning it up ! My Precious . I knew it . Give us the Precious ! Give me ! Give me ! Get off of me ! Give me the ring ! It 's mine ! Gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym . Just give me the ring ! Give it to me ! Give me the ring ! I said give it to me ! It 's mine !

 Captain ? Report . It looks like the Kazon have retreated , Captain . We must have hurt them . Not as bad as they hurt us . AII engines are off-Iine . Captain , shields are down , as are all weapons arrays . We 'd better hope they don 't come back . We 're sitting ducks . Janeway to Engineering . What 's your status ? We 're in bad shape , Captain . We had to shut down the warp engines to avoid a breach . The impulse engines are gone , too . I think I can give you thrusters , but I 've got a Iot of casualties down here , I 've got to tend to first . Lieutenant , it 's Kurt Bendera . He 's hurt pretty bad . No . His console exploded , caught him right in the face . We 've got to get him to Sick Bay right away . Torres to Sick Bay . I hope this is urgent , Lieutenant . We have our hands full at the moment . I 'm sending up an emergency transport . One of my people is severely burned . Very well . We 'II do what we can . More damage reports coming in , Captain . There 's a hull breach on Deck 4 . Force field 's in place . Repair crew 's on the way . There have been casualties on all decks . No fatalities so far . Captain , request permission to give Torres a hand in Engineering . Maybe I can help get propulsion up and running . Good idea . Go ahead . Captain , my readings indicate the navigational deflector has sustained massive damage . It will be necessary to repair it before we can achieve more than thruster power . Get repair crews on it . Mr. Kim , I want a complete analysis of all the damage we 've sustained . Yes , ma 'am . He 's not responding . 7 5 milligrams of impedrezene . That might help stimulate his cardiac functions , but he sustained so much injury , it may be too late . It had no effect . cortical stimulator . I 'm sorry . He was too badly injured . He saved my Iife once ... near the Cardassian border . Come in . Crewman Bendera 's dead . The Doctor couldn 't do anything . I 'm sorry , Chakotay . I know you were friends . will you arrange a memorial service ? I 'II get right on it . Was there something else ? Yes . Like it or not , it seems we 're in a situation where the rules have changed , and , maybe , if we 're going to survive out here , we have to start changing , too . What do you mean ? When we first started our trip home , you made a conscious decision to treat Voyager as a starfleet ship with a starfleet crew following StarfIeet rules . That 's right . StarfIeet works well in the alpha Quadrant . But out here ... maybe we should be thinking more like the Maquis . The Maquis had to survive on their own . We were up against insurmountable odds . We had to create our own opportunities for success because nobody was willing to help us . Sound like anybody you know ? If you 're suggesting we abandon our principles just because we 're out of hailing range ... Captain , this was the fourth attack in two weeks . We 've lost three crew members to the Kazon . A dozen more have sustained serious injuries . This ship has taken so much damage , we 'II be lucky to get warp drive on Iine again , and we can count on the fact that the Kazon will be back . I don 't think we can afford to keep doing business as usual . A Iot of us can say we 're alive today because of Kurt Bendera . There was never a better man to have at your side , never anyone more willing to take on the tough jobs . The first time I met him was in a mining community on TeIfas Prime . Some of the miners objected to my sense of humor and decided they should break a few of my bones . There were four of them and one of me , and I was taking a beating . suddenly , this man I 'd never seen before came out of nowhere and evened things up . We stood back to back , and pretty soon the others decided my sense of humor wasn 't so bad after all . I thanked the man . He just grinned and said , " I Iike a good fight . " He was my friend from that moment on . And he kept fighting the good fight ... right up to the end . I 'II miss him . Ensign . Captain , can I ask you something ? Of course . Now that the Kazon have stepped up their attacks , a Iot of people think that we 're not going to make it out of here alive . I 'd Iike to know what you have to say about that . Is there anything you have to say about that ? I assure you , you can speak freely . I 'd give them what they want . Give them the replicators and the transporters and whatever else it is they 're after . I 'm sure you realize that would be a violation of ... I know all about the Prime Directive . But you know what ? The Federation is 70,000 Iight-years away . What does it matter what these people do to each other with our technology ? I appreciate your concerns , Crewman , but let me make it absolutely cIear- - I 'II destroy this ship before I turn any part of it over to the Kazon . So that 's how the Maquis would do it , hmm ? It 's all right , Commander . I know Hogan 's upset . He and Bendera were close . But that 's not why he thinks we should give the Kazon what they want . I think I 've made my position clear on that . You have , but a Iot of the crew feel they haven 't had the chance to voice their opinions . This isn 't a democracy , Chakotay . I can 't run this ship by consensus . A Iot of the Maquis feel the Federation abandoned them years ago . You may be willing to die for Federation principles , but they 're not . I can 't believe you 'd support that man 's position . I don 't , but isn 't there something in between your position and his ? Deck 3 . AII I 'm saying , Captain , is that maybe there 's a little room for flexibility in interpreting StarfIeet 's protocols . frankly , I 'm not sure they were ever intended for situations like this . I haven 't seen any evidence that they 've let us down . Maybe this situation with the Kazon is the first example . Maybe we have to examine StarfIeet 's principles with a cold eye , and ask ourselves if they 're really applicable here . Computer , hold turboIift . Commander , if you have a specific suggestion please feel free to make it . Make a deaI- - an alliance . With the Kazon ? With one of their factions , or two . If we had the OgIa and the ReIora as our allies , the others would be afraid to touch us . Nothing we 've been through with the Kazon would lead me to believe they 're trustworthy . I can 't imagine making a deal with them . With all due respect ... maybe that 's because your imagination is limited by StarfIeet protocols . As Captain , you 're responsible for making decisions in the best interest of your crew , and I think you have to ask yourself ... if you 're doing that . Come in . Captain . This is unexpected . I 've been in your quarters before . Indeed , but so rarely that I can remember each instance . vulcan spice tea- - hot . And it was always at a time when you were particularly troubled . Right , as usual . Oh ... thank you . Commander Chakotay has proposed that we make an alliance with one of the Kazon factions . We wouldn 't give them weapons or technology , but we would pledge to support and defend them if they 're attacked . I am sure that made you uncomfortable . How can I consider it ? I can 't just walk away from the precepts StarfIeet has laid out for us- - you don 't deal with outlaws ; you don 't involve yourself in the political machinations of other cultures . It goes against everything I believe , everything I 've trained for , everything experience has taught me . Quite right . Do I hear a " however " coming ? You are perceptive , Captain . I believe Commander Chakotay 's suggestion does have merit . help me understand that . When I was a young man , a great visionary named Spock recommended an alliance between the Federation and the klingon Empire . This produced a major dispute . The KIingons , after all , were outlaws , employing violence and brutality in order to build their empire . I myself spoke out against such a coalition , but the alliance was forged , and it brought a stability to the Quadrant that had not been there for 200 years . Spock 's suggestion , so controversial at first , proved to be the cornerstone of peace . There are some differences here . By allying ourselves to one faction , we 'd be giving that faction more power than the others . That would clearly affect the internal politics of all the Kazon . I understand your concern , but , remember , it wouId only be a temporary arrangement since we are on our way out of this Quadrant . In the meantime , it might bring stability to the region and security for us . Once we 're gone , they 'II probably go back to their infighting . Perhaps . But even temporary stability can bring an appreciation for peace . This flower is a rare hybrid . As far as I know , it exists nowhere else in the galaxy . I created it by grafting a cutting from a South American orchid onto a vulcan favinit plant . I doubted the graft would take , and , indeed , the plant was sickly at first . However , after a few weeks , both plants adapted to their new condition and , in fact , became stronger than either had been alone . consequently , after much consideration , I 've decided to seek an alliance with one of the Kazon factions . Captain , you can 't be serious . This goes against ... Ensign ... I 'II be glad to discuss my reasoning with you at a more appropriate time . However , this meeting is not to debate the decision , but to decide how to pursue it . Captain ... if I may . Yes , Mr. NeeIix . We 're not far from a planet known as Sobras , where there 's a Kazon settlement inhabited by a faction known as the Pommar . I have an acquaintance there- - someone who owes me some favors . Some rather large favors , actually . Perhaps I couId meet with him and sound him out . Is he authorized to speak for his maje ? Not exactly , but he does have the maje 's ear . This would be strictly informal , but it might give us a reading on the possibility without the risk of actual confrontation . Good idea . Proceed , Mr. NeeIix . Why don 't we just contact Seska and form an alliance with her ? actually , that 's a good idea . You 've got to be kidding . Not at all . Seska has been trying to forge an alliance among the Kazon . She would jump at the chance to get our support . She 's right . If we went through Seska , at Ieast we could ally ourselves with the Nistrim . I think it 's a bad idea . You can 't have it both ways , Commander . If you want to get in the mud with the Kazon , you can 't start complaining that you might get dirty . Fine . I 'II talk with Seska . No . You 've been through too much with her . Mr. NeeIix , prepare to take your shuttle to Sobras . In the meantime , I 'II make contact with Seska . Dismissed . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49337.4 . After sending a subspace message to Seska and the Nistrim Maje CuIIuh , we have a received a quick response . Captain Janeway . Commander Chakotay . I must say we were surprised to hear from you . Are you willing to meet with us ? You 've made an interesting proposal . I 've discussed it with Seska , and she assures me that you would not make this gesture unless you were sincere . I will talk with you . I suggest we rendezvous . We 'II transmit coordinates to you . If you don 't mind , Captain , we 'd prefer to choose the coordinates . Fine . Transmit them to us . We 'II meet in approximately 20 hours . I must say , Captain , I Iook forward to this opportunity . hello , my friends . please , don 't let me interrupt . I was hoping to find my good friend jai Tersa here . Has he been in tonight ? Thank you . Tersa , my friend . It could be dangerous sneaking up on a man like that . I 'd never dream of sneaking up on you , but you were so engrossed in ... whatever it is you 're doing . A puzzle . What brings you here , TaIaxian ? I 'm good at puzzles . Perhaps I couId help . The dancer showed it to me . By moving only two rods , this dodecahedron can become an icosahedron . Hmm . She said she 'd spend the night with the man who could solve it . A splendid motivation , to be sure . I just might be able to make your night a memorable one . You know how to solve this ? I might ... if you 'II hear me out first . My fortunes have changed since we last met , Tersa . I 've become a person of some influence aboard a starship known as Voyager . You must think us very isolated . Everyone knows that . It 's probably the only reason you were allowed in here , especially after last time . Oh . A simple misunderstanding . Uh ... Tersa , I know you have the ear of your first maje , as I do of our Captain . And we could be quite useful to both of them . Go on . My Captain is interested in talking to your maje to discuss a possible alliance . Do you think he 'd have any interest in such a meeting ? An alliance ? Between the Kazon-Pommar and the Federations ? An interesting thought , isn 't it ? You 're coming with us . Tersa , explain to them . We 're friends . I have no idea who this person is . Some lunatic who sat down and started babbling . I guess you 'II be spending the night alone . You 've made a good choice . The Nistrim will be a potent ally . We want to make sure the Nistrim will also be an honorable ally , that you 'II adhere to the conditions we establish . You can let all the Kazon factions know that Voyager has formed a coalition with you and will be an ally to any Nistrim ship or outpost we encounter . In addition , we 're prepared to provide emergency supplies when needed- - food , medicine , clothing . What we will not provide is any of our technology or weaponry . Understood . Just one other detail ... an exchange of crew members . An exchange ? Yes . I 'm sure you 'II agree that our alliance should represent a genuine partnership . Perhaps you should define that . It 's obvious . Federation crew on my ship . Nistrim crew on yours . Maje , I think that 's a detail we could work out later . I can assure you that I would never agree to that . It seems a natural extension of your own proposal . We don 't have to decide everything right now . I will determine what we decide and when . Yes , Maje . I won 't have a woman dictate terms to me . CuIIuh ... I found the idea of an alliance with you distasteful . I was willing to explore the possibility , but now I see my instincts were dead on . talk to her . tell her to be reasonable . This meeting is over . As soon as your maje learns I 'm being imprisoned , - he 'II be outraged ! - Hurry up ! He won 't look kindly on anyone who 's made such an egregious error . What are you charging me with ? ! How long will I be held ? Move . well , I assume you 'II at Ieast let me confer with counsel . I have the ability to reward handsomely anyone who shows me a bit of understanding . Is that a baby ? My name is NeeIix . I-I 'm TaIaxian . I 'm Mabus . My friends and I are Trabe . They hurt you . I wasn 't walking quickly enough for them . Let 's get the bleeding stopped . Then I 'II clean it . Why are they holding you ? They seem to be detaining anyone who isn 't Kazon . several of our group have been taken for questioning , but so far , none of them have come back . How long have you been here ? Five days . They attacked us in space . 20 of our group died . We 've lost nine more since they put us in prison , including most of the governing council . I 'm the only one left . The Kazon won 't be satisfied until you 've all been annihilated . If we 've learned anything , it 's how to survive . Did you notice how many guards they have posted at the entrance to the prison ? only two . I guess they assume this place is so secure they don 't need any more . Why do you ask ? We don 't plan to sit here while they kill us one by one . We were able to get a message through to another Trabe vessel before we were boarded . help is on the way . Can we count on you ? Captain 's Log , supplemental . We 're on our way to rendezvous with Mr. NeeIix . I can only hope that he had more luck with the Kazon than we did . Captain , we 're approaching the coordinates . AII stop . I don 't see any trace of him . Long-range sensors indicate no sign of Mr. NeeIix 's shuttle within a radius of two Iight-years . The Kazon have him . We cannot jump to conclusions . He may simply have been delayed . We 'II hold position here for two hours . If he hasn 't shown up by then , we 'II go to Sobras . Lieutenant , could you fill us in a little ? There are all kinds of rumors flying around about what 's going on with the Kazon . Nothing 's going on yet . The Captain 's talk with Seska fell apart pretty quickly . Nothing 's going to come of all this . B 'EIanna , you were Seska 's friend . CouIdn 't you get word to her , try to work things out ? No , I couldn 't . I don 't understand ... Hogan , it 's gone too far . Seska isn 't the person we thought she was . I don 't trust her anymore . Even if it means us getting home in one piece ... or do you agree with our Captain that holding onto our technology is worth dying for ? Who are you to be second - guessing Captain Janeway ? The hardest thing you have to worry about is keeping that diIithium chamber filled . She is doing the best she can to get us home , and if you don 't like the way she 's doing it , I really don 't want to hear about it . Is that clear ? perfectly . Some of the children are too weak to run . We 'II have to carry them . We can use another pair of strong arms . You can count on me . I can 't promise we 'II get out of here alive , but if we stay here , we 'II die anyway . I 'd rather go out fighting , myself . That one might be a problem . He 's the kind who 'II start shooting at the first sign of trouble . I 'II keep an eye on him . This may be it . Be ready . Stay back . Get back ! Against the walls . Now ! Let 's go , Iet 's go- - come on ! Come on , everyone , Iet 's go . Come on ! Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Nice work , my friends . Let 's go . Come on . AII right , that 's it . We 're going after him . Mr. Paris , set a course for Sobras , full impulse . Aye , Captain . Tuvok , arm the phaser banks and load the forward torpedo bays . We don 't know what the Kazon have in store for us . shields at full power . yellow alert . AII hands at the ready . Captain . What is it ? Ships . Kazon ships on Iong-range sensors . closing fast . Confirmed , Captain . On screen . It appears to be an armada , and their weapons are powered . Red alert . Power all weapon systems and stand ready . Mr. Kim , haiI the lead ship . They 're hailing us , Captain . I 'II put it on screen . hello , Captain . I 'd Iike you to meet my good friend Mabus . We 've just escaped from the Kazon-Pommar . What are you doing on a Kazon ship ? They 're Trabe vessels , actually . Everything the Kazon have , they stole from the Trabe . Mabus will tell you all about it over a sumptuous dinner . The food hasn 't been very good where we 've been . I Iook forward to it . I was eight years old when it started . I wasn 't even particularly aware of the Kazon . They lived in restricted areas that children weren 't allowed to go near . I didn 't know they lived in poverty , and filth ... I didn 't know they were persecuted by the Trabe police . I was told they were violent and dangerous and had to be kept isolated , so they wouldn 't get loose and kill us , which is exactly what they did , but we brought it on ourselves . The Trabe treated them like animaIs- - fenced them in , encouraged them to fight amongst themselves so they wouldn 't turn on us and sat by while they turned into a violent , angry army . When they finally realized we were their true enemy , we didn 't stand a chance . I was luckier than most . A friend 's father grabbed me and took me with his family to one of the starships that managed to escape . I can still remember ... it happened so fast . One minute ... I was a happy child playing in a field ; the next , an orphan , exiled in space . It strikes me that in many ways , we 're in the same predicament- - separated from the lives we knew , searching for home . A goal you may well achieve , Captain , but the Kazon have refused to allow us to find a new homeworld . Every time we try to settle somewhere , they attack and drive us away . We 're scattered , Iike nomads , with no home and little hope . It happened over 30 years ago and the Kazon are still trying to punish you ? remarkable , isn 't it ? Most of the Trabe who persecuted the Kazon are either dead or old men by now . Most of us were children when the uprising occurred , and our children are innocent , but the Kazon 's desire for revenge is as strong as ever . How are you able to transmit to us without your crew knowing it ? well , that 's for me to worry about . Let 's just say I 'm very familiar with communications protocols . Now , will you let me talk to Seska ? Not without some proof you can be trusted . She and I knew each other for a Iong time . She knows that I can be trusted . Just let me talk to her . I 'II convey your message . Contact me tomorrow , and I 'II let you know if she 's willing to talk to you . Before the uprising , the Trabe were known as a highly evolved species . They produced scholars and artists who were widely admired , and their technology was among the finest in the Quadrant . No one really knew about the Kazon and how they were being treated . Why not ? holding another culture in virtual slavery isn 't the kind of thing that would go unnoticed . You have to understand , the Trabe were rich and powerful . They manipulated information about the conditions on their planet , and no one wanted to risk offending them and losing opportunities for trade . It seems to me that they 've learned their lesson . Mabus and his people have freely acknowledged that they were responsible for what happened to them . still , I do not see that it is a particularly good idea to form an alliance with the bIood-enemies of the Kazon . We risk uniting all the factions against us . The only thing the Kazon agree on now is that we are their common enemy . It 's hard to imagine it getting much worse . The Trabe have a Iot of ships and a Iot of weapons in that convoy . I think this alliance would be better than none at all . I 'd rather not be in the position of making an alliance at all , but that may be a luxury we simply don 't have . My gut tells me we don 't have any friends among the Kazon . As for the Trabe ... I believe that people have a capacity to change . It 's always been StarfIeet 's policy to deal with new species on a basis of openness and trust ... until proven otherwise . Captain , I 'm glad to see you . I wanted to thank you for the use of your medical facilities . We have very few doctors . Everyone seems to be in generally good condition . malnutrition is the most common problem , but it 's easily alleviated with bio-nutrient supplements . Thank you , Doctor . How much longer do you need ? I 'd say less than an hour . will you walk with me ? Of course . I 've been thinking ... about our conversation at dinner . Mm-hmm . About the things we share , and it seems to me we could be of mutual benefit to each other . Go on . What would you say to the possibility of our joining forces- - my starship and your convoy ? clearly we 'd be a stronger force if we did that . We could travel together for as long as it 's advantageous to both of us . Maybe we 'II find our way out of Kazon territory , and you could settle on a new homeworld . It 's a reasonable idea , Captain . I have no objection , but it wouId only benefit your group and mine . There are other Trabe who wouldn 't enjoy the same protection . I wonder ... if you might consider a somewhat more ... bold plan . tell me . Together , Voyager and the Trabe would be a force to be reckoned with . Suppose we took advantage of that and asked the representatives of all the Kazon factions to join us at the bargaining table . In order to achieve what ? Peace . Together , we would represent a stabilizing force in this part of the Quadrant- - bring the factions together , convince them that an end to violence would be in everyone 's best interest . Think about it . I believe it could work . It 's a message from Voyager . They 've formed an alliance ... with the Trabe ! The Trabe ? They 're calling for a conference of all first majes . How could this have happened ? It happened because you let Voyager slip away , right into the hands of the Trabe , by insisting on that ridiculous exchange of crews . I couId not let the negotiations be dictated by that woman . That 's becoming a tired refrain , CuIIuh . One day that attitude will be your undoing . Watch your tongue . Or what ? I 'm carrying your child . I don 't think you 'd do anything to jeopardize him . We can still turn this to our advantage . We have a crewman on Voyager who 's willing to provide information to us . There 's Iong-term potential in that arrangement . We mustn 't lose sight of it . You 're not suggesting we go to this conference- - that we come running like a CaIogan dog when the Federations call ? could you risk being the only maje who doesn 't attend ? Of course you 'II go and listen . Nothing should be negotiated there- - not at the point of a Federation weapon , but you can learn a great deal , assess the mood of the other majes . Find out the strength of the Trabe convoy . You may be right . You can come out of this a hero . You can use this conference to unite the factions , eradicate the Trabe once and for all , and take Voyager as a trophy . Ooh . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49342.5 . NeeIix has returned from Sobras where he learned a disturbing piece of information that may require us to rethink our plans . He was a Takrit- - a band of mercenaries that operates in this system . What was he doing when the Kazon-Pommar arrested him ? My contact on the planet said that he was making a sketch of the conference site , and believe me , the Takrit are not known for their art . Who sent him ? That 's as much information as I got . So someone wants to sabotage this conference . One of the majes . Why miss a chance to wipe out your rivals while they 're together in one room ? If that is true , then one of them will undoubtedly try to leave before the meeting is finished . Captain , I think you should consider not going to the conference . No . If I can help bring stability to this Quadrant , I 'm not going to walk away because of a rumor . A rumor that must be taken seriously , nonetheless . Agreed . Commander ... monitor all the Kazon vessels carefully and look out for any suspicious ship movement near the surface . Keep us on a constant transporter lock so we can beam out at the first hint of trouble . Tuvok , NeeIix , you 're with me . I gave a great deal of thought to the shape of the table . I finally decided on a triangle . Your group would sit on one side . The majes would occupy the other two . Does that seem appropriate ? Have you heard anything more about the matter we discussed ? Don 't talk about that here . It could mean my head . Does the table shape seem acceptable ? Tersa , this time I am here with a powerful starship . You better be telling me everything you know . I am , I swear . I want to thank you for making it possible to have the conference here on Sobras . My maje has rewarded me handsomely for the prestige it affords him . If there is any further way I can be of service , please let me know . He hasn 't heard anything more , but he 's frightened . He must believe something 's going to happen . The first majes of the Kazon Order . Minnis of the Pommar . Surat of the MostraI . Loran of the Hobii . VaIek of the OgIamar . And CuIIuh of the Nistrim . Captain , we seem destined to encounter each other . This is Mabus , a governor of the Trabe . Maje CuIIuh , I 'm gratified to be meeting you Iike this . I hope we 'II be able to come to terms . I never thought I 'd see the day when any of us would sit at a table with the Trabe . Times change , Maje . Perhaps . shall we ? Our gracious host , jai Minnis , has provided food and drink to make our discussions more pleasant . We appreciate your coming . We hope this will lead to a new climate of peace . Peace ? With the Trabe ? Forgive me if I 'm a bit skeptical . I understand . After decades of antagonism , you 're bound to be suspicious . But surely , everyone here is tired of constant violence . Aren 't you really trying to get us to relax our guard so the Trabe can conquer us again ? How could we do that ? We 're scattered and dispirit . AII we ask for is a chance to find a new homeworld and settle peacefully . Excuse me . Captain Janeway , I 'm curious as to the nature of this alliance you 've struck with the Trabe . especially since you refused my offer of a similar pact . I found the goals of the Trabe to be compatible with our own . I represent an organization which is devoted to peaceful coexistence among people . The Trabe want nothing more than that . The Trabe have always wanted peace for themselves , but we paid the price . They lived in luxury and we lived in squalor and misery . What I fear , Captain , is that this union you 've made with the Trabe is an effort to force us to capitulate . If so , we assure you it is doomed to failure . I won 't pretend that our alliance wasn 't an attempt to make a show of strength . separately , we and the Trabe are vulnerable . Together , we are stronger . Are you threatening us , Captain ? It is important that you understand our determination , but it 's not a threat . It 's an offer . A negotiated peace among all of us would provide a greater stability in this Quadrant . How could that do anything but benefit us all ? I can 't speak for all of you , but I , for one , don 't think we can trust this proposal . A woman and a Trabe- - how can we listen to them ? I find you nothing but a hypocrite , Captain- - aIIying yourself to the greatest villains this Quadrant has ever known . If this is where your revered Federation values have taken you , I want no part of it . gentlemen , allow me to confer with my Federation colleagues . please , have some refreshments and let us continue in a few moments . Captain , would you please join me ? Captain , I really need to talk to you now . Get down ! What is this , Captain ? It 's a trap ! Take cover ! Voyager , Red alert . We 're on it . You 've ruined what would have been the greatest step toward peace in decades . Peace ? A massacre ? I couId have decimated the Kazon leadership . It would have taken them years to recover . You planned this whole thing and used our goodwill to make sure you were successful . You don 't know the Kazon . There 's no dealing with them . violence is all they understand . Or perhaps it 's all you understand . You 're naive , Captain . It 's clear you have no understanding of the harsh realities of this part of space . What I tried to do was done as much for you as it was for us . I 'm not grateful , and I want you off my ship . Chief , beam our former guest back to his vessel . Captain , don 't do this . You 're going to need us . I don 't think so . The Kazon will be determined to seek revenge . How can this one ship hope to survive ? Not by making deals with executioners . Energize . I would suggest we depart before the Kazon have a chance to return to their ships . Janeway to Paris . Get us out of here . Aye , Captain . There 's no question we 're more vulnerable now than ever . We have to take every measure to make sure we 're prepared for an attack . I want continual diagnostics on all ship 's systems . I will schedule additional battle drills for all hands . Mr. NeeIix , what about our food supplies ? We 're in good shape , Captain . We shouldn 't have to stop anywhere for several weeks . Good . Lieutenant , what 's the condition of our propulsion systems ? We have a reasonable supply of antimatter . Barring any major problems , we should have maximum performance of both warp and impulse engines . There 's just one more thing I want to say . I hope there 's a lesson for all of us in this . although some of the species we 've encountered here have been peaceful , others seem governed only by their own seIf-interests . This appears to be a region of space that doesn 't have many rules . But I believe we can learn something from the events that have unfolded . In a part of space where there are few rules , it 's more important than ever that we hold fast to our own . In a region where shifting allegiances are commonplace , we have to have something stable to rely on , and we do- - the principles and ideals of the Federation . As far as I 'm concerned , those are the best allies we could have .

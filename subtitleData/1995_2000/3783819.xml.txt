 We 're wasting our time . There 's no way off this plateau from here . Where 's Marguerite ? Maybe she 's had better luck . Well , well , what a surprise . Just making the most out of a bad situation ... why leave empty handed . That 's reason enough for me ... but hey take your time . I 'm sure it 's not as hungry as it sounds . It 's miles away . Roxton wait for me . You forget who funded this expedition . With you constantly reminding me how could I ? Why are you always in such a hurry ? Because I 'm trying to find a way home ... before we die out here . Well I for one intend to be rich when we get there . What the hell ? Where 's that coming from ? I don 't like this Roxton . - Do you see something ? - Just stay together . Stay back ! Get your hands off me ! No ! Marguerite ! No ! My God , what are ... No ! She has returned . At the dawn of the century A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of the Lost World Are you okay ? You 're kidding right ? They look like Druids . They acting like you 're some sort of goddess . Novel way to greet a deity . Maybe we should get out of here before they realize their mistake . Not a goddess ... a high priestess . And you would be ? I am Bokra ... and these are your people . My ? Lost in the cosmos for almost two thousand years . How careless of you . It 's been a pleasure meeting you . We 'll have to do this again sometime . But you bare the sign ... the sun , the moon ... the serpent . My birthmark . Your birthright ... it is the sign of our people . Let 's get one thing straight you 're not my people . Where you now see two torn ragged holes ... two spectacular emeralds once shown . Emeralds that large ? You are the only one who can bring them back for us . Sounds like he 's got your number . It is your destiny to retrieve them . To anchor us once again ... in one place in one time . Why me ? You are the reincarnation of Morrighan ... our priestess ... our savior . Sorry but you must have me confused with some other priestess . You two coming ? What happens if Marguerite doesn 't bring the emeralds back ? Then we are doomed . Any time now . Marvelous , bravo . Enough meat there for a month ... but rather a dangerous way of hunting . Only for the dinosaur . I can 't argue with that . Now there 's just the small task of ... - hauling it all the way back ... - Shhhhh What is it ? Hear that ? Over there . Look at him . oh ! there , there it 's all right . A baby here ? That 's incredible . Where 'd it come from ? He must have been abandoned . Or lost which means ... its parents must be about here somewhere . How could they leave you here ? Don 't cry , don 't cry . Veronica ... his parents can 't be far away . They 're probably looking for him right now . Where are you going ? Well we can 't just leave him here . No of course not ... what are we going to do with a baby ? For centuries we 've been praying for your return . Look you 've been very kind ... the clothes are lovely but my friends are waiting for me . You think that life is just here and now ? There is so much more . Yes I know ... I 'm a reincarnated priestess and you 're lost in time . I understand your skepticism ... we defy all the laws of nature as you know them . Even as a child I never believed in fairy tales . Then how do you explain us being here at all . You make a hell of an entrance I 'll give you that . Two thousand years ago our civilization ... was about to be annihilated . Only Morrighan could see beyond it ... only she could find a way to save us . By setting you a drift ... in another dimension . For what seems like an eternity we 've been ... fading in and out of existence waiting for Morrighan to return . I 'm sorry , perhaps you can sell it to the next brunette that comes along . I know you Marguerite . All your life you 've been driven by something you don 't understand . An emptiness inside , a void that all the riches in the world will never fill . It is your destiny to save us ... or at least to try . Our lives depend on you ... making a leap of faith . Gracious me , who would leave a baby in the jungle ... he 'd never survive a day ? My point exactly . His parents are obviously around here somewhere we must find them . I agree that 's the first thing we must do . The poor little dickens must be frightened out of his wits . The first thing we need to do is wash and feed him . Look at him Summerlee ... he 's obviously not a native . Yes he does look European I agree . That means there must be another expedition on the plateau . And if they found a way up here maybe they know a way down . Precisely . A mother would never leave her baby . Unless she was trying to protect it . And what about the rest of the expedition ? We have to try to find them . If they 're alive we might be able to help each other . Or maybe they 're beyond help . So do you buy it ? Not on your life . Then what do you suppose their up to ? Dammed if I know ... some kind of mass hysteria ... maybe we 've been drugged . I 'm starting to believe anything is possible here . Her highness returns . Are you going to help them ? Marguerite help someone ? Only if there 's a percentage in it for her . Then you 'd better come along ... just to keep me honest . You can 't be serious ? I think she is . Marguerite ? Where do we start ? - We ? - I 'm in . Oh come on , you 're as crazy as she is . Oh what the hell . When you take the first step ... the path will present itself . I don 't like riddles . Oh my God . Here comes the fog . What now ? Now , we take the first step . Can you see anything ? Nothing but this fog . I don 't like this . You can turn back . There is no back . I don 't think there 's a forward either . One hell of a first step . I don 't see any path . Look around . Let 's get out of here . Good idea your worship . Which way would you suggest ? What are you waiting for , shoot ! I didn 't know you were that eager to die . They 're getting closer ! Do I have to do everything myself . Don 't ! The smell of blood will drive them into a feeding frenzy . We won 't be able to take on all of them . - Any ideas ? - We stick together . Run ! We 're dead meat out here in the open . If we can make it to those trees and find some cover ... maybe we can make a stand . Looks like our only option . Now , start to move . No sudden moves nice and slow . I say we make a run for it . Not yet . They 're going to be on us any second . Don 't turn your back , show no fear . A trail . Look ! Where 'd they go ? It 's impossible . It 's all impossible . Let 's get going before they decide to come back . Is he alright ? He 's so beautiful . He is when he 's like this . You 'd cry too if you were hungry and alone . Well yes , I suppose I would . I searched the entire area where we found it . No sing of any humans . Nothing at all ? The only foot prints I found belonged to ape-men . How many ? I don 't know ... a lot around where we found the baby ... more on the trail too and they were fresh . and they were fresh . Well , it appears that Veronica is right ... the ape-men may have killed the parents . And not found the baby ? What other explanation is there ? What should I call you ? My father 's name was Tom . He 's not a stray cat he 's not yours just because you found him . Do you want me to put him back where we found him ? No , of course not . We have to go on searching for the parents . They 're dead professor . You don 't actually know that . This is my home ... and now it 's his . So when are you going to tell me ? Tell you what ? Why you decided to become Moses to lead the Druids to the Promised Land . Leading people on doomed expeditions is ... your forte , not mine . Whatever you say your holiness . Looks like we have to make a choice . - Now what ? - Priestess ! Philistine ! You two go this way I 'll go the other ... there 's gotta be a sign or something . I 'm sure there will be . Well that 's very reassuring . Meet back here , ten minutes . Here ! See something you want ? What are you offering ? More than you can handle I 'm sure . Oh from what I 've seen I ... think I could manage . Manage ? Is that the best you can do ? where shall I begin ? Help ! Marguerite ! Roxton ! Help ! Sounds serious . Yeah . Somebody , anybody help ! What a mess how 'd you end up in there ? - Just get me out ! - Stay back . Where are you going ? I 'm not going anywhere just ... stepping out of the quicksand . I 'm sinking fast ! Don 't move you 're only making it worse . Marguerite lay down . What ? You 're going to have to stretch out to him . I 'll anchor your feet it 's the only way . - Me stretch out in that ? - Come on you 're wasting time . You do it . - I 'm too heavy . It has to be you . - Oh ple ... Marguerite , please ! OK , OK , OK . Right , down on your belly . Disgusting . Marguerite you 're doing fine . I 'm sinking ! Relax your body surrender to the quicksand . I 'll kill you for this Roxton I swear it . No ! Thank you , thank you ! You know what ? What ? I think it was the other fork . Lullaby ... close you eyes ... and dream of sunny skies . First thing in the morning we begin the search again . Do you think we 'll find them ? Alive ? Not likely . Just look at her she 's a natural mother ... almost makes me wish she could keep him . Don 't you start . If it 's not too personal George ... why did you and Jessie never have children ? It 's too personal Arthur . Sorry . One of us didn 't want any . No ! - Where do you think you 're going ? - Get out of my way ! - Veronica no ! - Let go of me ! Wait till daylight we can 't track them at night . I 'm leaving now with or without you ! I could sure use a bath . How long have we been walking ? Eleven hours since the quicksand . We don 't have much time . If the Druids are in such a damn hurry to get their emeralds ... why didn 't they just drop us a little closer ? Because we have to prove we 're worthy . - Of what ? - Staying alive . What the hell are you doing ? Headhunters . They 're gone . I 've had just about enough of this . What else are they going to throw at us ? Don 't look at me . Well who else should I look at ? You didn 't have to come . This whole thing is out of control . You know that dart was this close to killing you . It 's not your mission in life to protect me . Protect you ? It 's the rest of the world that needs protection from you . Just what 's that supposed to mean ? Guys , I don 't thing now is the time for this . It means you 're an overwhelming pain in the ass . I think they want us to move along , now ! Why do you believe anything the Druids have said to you is true ? Because I can 't come up with anything else that explains all this . Maybe I want it to be true . For someone who trusts no one ... she 's taking a hell of a lot on faith . What time is it ? Ten minutes after the last time you asked . We 're getting nowhere . We 're following the trail . How do you know it 's the right trail ? Maybe we missed something maybe we should turn around . We 're not turning around ... this is the right way I 'm sure of it . How can you be sure ? It 's the way we 've been directed . The vicious little creatures on the beach the quicksand , headhunters ... they 'll be other signs . Hopefully more conventional ones . This forest is never ending . Patience , whatever needs to be revealed will be . Words of wisdom ? Look Marguerite ... just because some old Druid thinks you 're a ... high priestess doesn 't mean you are one . Maybe we should have gone around the quicksand ? If you two want to turn around and go back ... that 's fine with me . I 'm going to visit the powder room then I 'm going to get some emeralds . She 's taking this whole thing rather seriously don 't you think ? I don 't know what to think . Magic fog , disappearing dinos , emeralds the size of a man 's fist . It doesn 't make much sense to me . There 's gotta be a rational explanation . Let me know if you come up with one . That was quick . Have you noticed there 's no sign of any living creature ... not a squirrel , not a bird . Just endless trees ... and so quiet ... it gets to you after while . I just hope this is leading somewhere . Roxton ? Malone ? What the hell you couldn 't even wait two minutes . Go on without me . I 'll catch up . Two minutes Veronica . The ape-men aren 't resting . We 've been tracking them all night . They 're running we 're walking . At least we know there 's only two of them . So far . Yes but they 're heading away from the ape village not towards it . So they 're going to eat Tommy ... on their own and not share him with the others . Veronica , take it easy we will find him . We better . Feeling better ? Yes but I 'm worried ... for all we know they could be leading us right into a trap . That 's already occurred to me ... not a pleasant thought . Do you think she knows where she 's going ? Seems to . Aren 't we heading back the same way we came ? Feels like we 're going in circles . - Are you sure ? - Aren 't you ? Shouldn 't somebody tell her ? In the mood she 's in ? Somebody 's gotta tell her . Your funeral . Marguerite ! Marguerite ! How in the world did you do that ? What the hell are you doing ? Have you completely lost your mind ? Drop the knife ! Put it down ! Where is she ? I don 't know , she 's disappeared . Are you all right ? What did I say ? Why did you turn down here ? You 're going in circles . Stop right there . First you abandon me now you 're gonna shoot me . I said stay where you are . I will not ... put the gun down stop fooling around . You tried to kill me . I tried to kill you ? Yeah . With my knife . Much as I may have been tempted ... to kill you from time to time , I have never ... acted on my impulses . Sure looked like it to me . I left you alone for two minutes when I came back you were gone . I heard a commotion coming from what is obviously ... the wrong direction ... and here I am . Roxton ... there 's no blood on her face . There 's not a mark from where you hit her . You hit me ? He had to . In the face ? She looked just like you . Absolutely identical . You 're hallucinating both of you . I 'm telling you we 're not alone . There ! Let 's get back to the trail . On the double , eyes open . Unbelievable . This is unreal . How many are there ? Too many . They 're everywhere . Run ! Ouch . Tree ! They 're still behind us . Go ! If they wanna kill me let ' em . I 'm done running . We 'll make our stand here . Come on ! Come and get us ! - Roxton ? - Patience . I don 't see any . Where the hell are they ? Stay here , don 't lose sight of me . Anything ? They 're gone . Summerlee ? Shhhh . What is it ? I saw something . Look ! What 's she doing ? That 's incredible . It 's her baby ? It can 't be . It can 't be anything else . - I lost her . - Shhh . Veronica . Are you all right ? Where is she ? I have to find her ! No wait ! Damn , if only I could 've reasoned with him . You have no choice , it was either him or Veronica . Let 's find her . If anyone had told me about this place I 'd have them committed . You okay ? Fine . What is it ? Now is not the time for secrets . What if they 're wrong ? Did you really believe you were the high priestess ? If we don 't bring back the emeralds they 'll be lost . And you 're concerned for their well being ? Yes . Well no offence Marguerite but ... you are one of the most selfish ... self-centered individuals I have ever known . Why do you care ? No offence Roxton , but you wouldn 't understand . Guys ! Rest times over . Our friends are back . I think they want us to go this way . Whoa ! Now what ? Must have missed a sign somewhere . I don 't think so . The emeralds . I don 't think they want us to go back . We sure as hell aren 't going forward . We can 't hold them here . We can until we 're out of bullets . And then what ? And then we think of something else . Now get ready . We 'll make a run for it before we use up all our ammunition . Not a chance . It 's either that or learn to fly . What do you say Marguerite ? Would you forget about the damn emeralds ? All your life you 've been driven by something you don 't understand . It is your destiny to save us . Our lives depend on you ... making a leap of faith . Marguerite what are you doing ? Marguerite ! I don 't believe it . Impossible . Evidently not . How the hell did you know there was a bridge here ? I didn 't . You must have seen it . Did you ? Well no but that 's just my point . Save your point , to pry the emeralds loose . Then all we have to do is get them back to the Druids . How hard can that be after what we 've been through ? Not another word Malone . You 're quite sure we 're right ? What other explanation can it be ? How are we going to tell her ? I don 't know , now 's a good a time as any . She can 't be far . She is running for her life . Stealing my baby . Not yours . We 've been through this . His mother is dead . No Veronica , I 'm afraid she 's not . What ? You saw them in the clearing . The baby wasn 't afraid of her ... because she 's his mother . The one I shot ... that was his father . No ! You saw them Veronica ... she was nursing him . But Tommy 's human you said it yourself . Not quite human ... but the next step in the evolutionary chain . No I don 't believe it . That is why the ape-man left him to die in the jungle ... because he 's different . The parents couldn 't let him die ... they came after him and they came after us ... They loved him Veronica , his mother loves him . I won 't hurt you . Just give me the baby . Give me the baby . Give him to me . It 's okay , just give him to me . Just give me the baby . Give him to me ! Take my hand . The Druids could have mentioned the bloody fire ... beasts and savages are one thing . The only way is through the fire . Oh yeah , after you . Marguerite ! Oh my God ! Marguerite ! Stop ! That isn 't Marguerite , it 's Morrighan . What happens now ? Now that you have made the leap ... this is only part of your destiny . The rest will reveal itself in time . I don 't understand why can 't you tell me now ? You have given us life . We must return to a time where we can flourish . A moment in history , a place called Stonehenge . What about me ? When we go history will have changed . It would be as if we have never been here at all . May the Gods be with you Marguerite and the spirit of Morrighan ... guide you . Wait ! Frightened of a little fog ? I couldn 't see where I was going that 's all . It was pretty thick there for a minute . Let 's get back to the balloon . There 's should be just time enough to investigate the peninsula . Provided we don 't stop for any geological specimens . I still have plenty of room . Can 't you think of anything else ? Not at the moment . Let 's go . Any day now . How far did you get ? The northern caves and a little beyond . Nothing ? Less than nothing . Not a total loss . Seems smaller than I remember . So anything happen here . Oh we 've had quite the adventure .

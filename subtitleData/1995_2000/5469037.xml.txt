 The unobserved state is a fog of probabilities ... a window of and for error . The watcher observes . The fog collapses . An event resolves . A theory becomes a fact . What is the truth ? Tell me if you know , and I will not believe you . Things are never what they seem . Clean gloves hide dirty hands ... and mine are dirtier than most . Without truth , there can be no justice . Justice will be done . Illuminating sentiments , Chairman Goodchild . So what about justice for Clavius ? It 's now been six months since the abduction of our elected president . Justice for Clavius . Justice for all of us . There can be no more secrets . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . And what are your secrets , Chairman ? I have nothing to hide . From now on , I will hide nothing . Only an open society can be a just society . Most revealing . Very impressive . You 've made your point . Now , where is President Clavius ? I wish I knew . We must wait for the terrorists to make their move . So you 've little hope . I fear he may be dead . How interesting . Perhaps , then , you can explain this video reel we obtained ... from your own security force . Clavius ! He 's alive ! Don 't you know a tape like that can be faked ? By showing it , you are playing into the hands of our enemies . Many people hate you and would like to see you dead . How does that make you feel ? Those people should get to know me a little better . Then they 'd know I don 't indulge in feelings . See it , my friends , and embrace it . Embrace the new openness . Nothing is sacred . Nothing is secret . Chairman Goodchild . Gildemere , please . We 're doing what we can about Clavius . Stop pestering me . You saw the attack on me today . Those people are maniacs and cannot be trusted . Yes , we must be careful whom we trust . You 've served me well today , and now I must serve you . I owe you very much , Clavius . You have given me the way to Aeon Flux ... and I will give her freedom . True freedom . Freedom from prying eyes and expectations . A private place . A place of our own . Tell me why I shouldn 't kill you . We 're being watched . My name is Aeon Flux . I 'm here on a mission to assassinate Trevor Goodchild . Is everybody listening ? Do you believe me ? Everybody happy now ? You 're crazy . You can 't kill Chairman Goodchild . He 's our most beloved and trusted leader . You don 't need to kill him . Clavius is alive . I know Chairman Goodchild came to power by illegitimate means . We can bring him down . Put your hand there , and press down . What ? Is this okay ? Harder . Do you have any proof ? Proof ? Of course . I 've tailed him for months . Clavius wasn 't kidnapped . At least , not by terrorists . Don 't waste my time . No , wait . I do have proof . I 'm sure this is very significant . - Can I borrow this ? - Well ... - Can I borrow the fabric ? - Lf you 'll help me . You 're going to like my help . Sir , I think you better see this . I think they 're having fun at our expense , soldier . Let it go . What is this ? Look , let 's not even bother with those idiots . Just show me some action . Going somewhere ? Vacation for 10 years ? Counsellor Gaylen ... you know the rules . Total information awareness , equal opportunity enforcement . We are not losing anything ... but shame , inhibition ... perversion , depravity ... degeneracy ... You 're late . The patient is in the eleventh hour of surgery . We 'll have to go in , close the vessels . Removal could get messy . Naturally , the removal . Yes , excision of the tumour ... Must proceed , and my skills ... Will be ... You have a certain bedside manner ... with the ... The tumour . I see . In other words , we must remove the patient ... from the tumour . And restore function to the organ . I 'm a tumour now ? Stop pretending . I know you 're coming after me . Come on . Look at me , Aeon . What ? What ? You are alive . Clavius ? My God , what 's that bastard done to you ? Stay calm . I 'll be back . - What are you doing here ? - I found Clavius . - He 's free ? - No . I couldn 't . Listen , I think I 'm being watched . You don 't miss a trick . There are things I have to do . Keep this safe here . - What is it ? - Evidence . Trevor is more dangerous than I 'd realised . What he 's done to Clavius is beyond treason . He 's being kept in a chamber under Trevor 's bed . I 'm going to release him . I think we 've done it , Aeon . Think of it as a challenge . I must go . We 'll be together soon . Well , Trevor , what do you ... - Well , how do you like it ? - What a dress . I 'm sure it looks good on you . You shouldn 't leave that thing lying around . Never know who might end up with it . You don 't know what you 're meddling with here . You have no idea what this is all about . I sure don 't . I thought you had an operation here . I thought you were getting some work done . Where is the smoke-filled room ? Where are the sleazy characters ? Where are the window dressers ? You don 't like it , do you ? I 'm just trying to survive , unlike you . For example , Gildemere . I can 't see what you 're doing there . He 's a bad accident waiting to happen . Gildemere ? Yes . Tell me about our friend , Gildemere . Do you have a tip for me ? Maybe some spare change ... something about this plot to take me down . When will you give up , Aeon ? Here . Go ahead . Kill me if that 's what you want . You can 't do it . You think you know what I 'm doing , so obviously you don 't . What I have in mind for you is much worse . Are you all right ? I want out . I want out . What 's been through you , sir ? I mean , what have you been through ? How long have I been ... 192 days , sir . The wide acceptance of the new openness ... has no doubt exceeded even your highest expectations ... Chairman Goodchild . Congratulations . So why doesn 't this new openness apply to the Clavius case ? We will relay any information as soon as it comes in . Unfortunately , there isn 't any . Paisuck , Andrus , Turkalou ! Who did this ? They 've rounded up the whole network ... and you stood by and let this happen . These citizens must be released at once . Cellblock X-7 ? These are drug traffickers , wet-workers , defrauders . Are you certain ? By locking them up , Trevor has shut down our base of credit , you fool . These men are my special friends . Why is it so hot in here ? I 'm staggered by the complexity of these documents , sir . I 've spent many hours trying to crack the codes . What didn 't you understand ? I think I have a handle on some of it . For example , the " mile-high jellyfish " ... that 's the upper house of parliament . Am I right ? No . And the " flying saucer men , " that 's the Ministry of Justice ? No , the flying saucer men are the flying saucer men . Narzak . Area 66 . The global empire . What level are you ? We 're men of peace , so we attack . Deploy the orbital jellyfish . Next , expulsion of all foreign particles . You 're mad . You 're insane . Shut up , mother . I don 't know ... But at least you must have some idea where they 're hiding Clavius . No ! Actually , you 're right . What are we doing here ? We have the leads . All security forces are to convene in Y-Section . I wonder where Trevor would be if not for true patriots like you , Gildemere . But you wanted Trevor dead . Did I ? You knew Clavius was insane . You 're hurting my hand . Normally I like that ... but , in this case , I can 't reciprocate your feelings . Goodbye . Goodbye ? Goodbye ? Goodbye . Stop . No . Not now . You should have killed me when you had the chance . I 'm in control now . Clavius is dead , and you 're the terrorist . Aeon , you 're mine . But ... She 's got Clavius . It looks like we 've caught our terrorist . A Monican agent . Uncover the body . Whatever . Who 's that ? Trevor Goodchild is guilty . He 's the terrorist . He was propped up with the help of this Monican traitor . They kept Clavius locked up ... and this is the proof . He used this on Clavius . Follow me . Follow him . He knows where Clavius is . He pulled the plug . Yes , I pulled the plug . I did what Trevor couldn 't and saved us from the corruption and madness . But Trevor Goodchild lied to us , and now I will show you . This is your man . I had the key , and I gave it back to her . I had the key , and I gave it back to her .

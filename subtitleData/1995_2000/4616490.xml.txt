 DOUGLAS : Our plane crashed in the endless Southern Pacific and we drifted for days between life and death . [ MAN 1 MAN 2 GRUNTING ] On the sixth or seventh day , the two men who had survived with me began to fight over the last canteen of water . [ DOUGLAS GRUNTING ] They fought like beasts , not men . [ GUN COCKS ] Stop ! [ YELLS ] [ MAN 1 GROANS ] [ MUFFLED groaning ] I fought for my life just as savagely as they did . MONTGOMERY [ whispering ] : But why ? Why would you want me to do that ? Positively no other survivors . Run preliminary tests ? What 's the point ? Okay . [ MONTGOMERY humming ] [ lN NORMAL VOICE ] Feeling better ? - Where am I ? - Mm . You 're on a seafaring vessel named the Ombak Penari . Who are you ? My name is Montgomery . And you are ? Edward Douglas . I was on my way to Jakarta . My plane went down . [ GASPS ] I 'm working on an assignment for the United Nations . I 'm working on the peace settlement . There was a lot of blood on that life raft . You were the only survivor . Yes . - I need to get to a radio ... - Whoa , whoa . - ... as soon as possible . - Be calm . Just be calm . Just calm . - I 'm still hydrating you . - Yeah . There 's no radio on this vessel . I 'm gonna pay the captain of the ship to take you to Timor which is about four days after they drop me off ... - ... at my little island paradise . - What are you giving me ? Oh , you 'll like it. I like it . It 's a little Jimi Hendrix . - Oh , wait . - Ow ! Wait , wait , wait . Are you a doctor ? Are you a doctor ? Well , I 'm more like a vet .

Don 't be rude . There you are . [ DOUGLAS sighs ] - What 's going on ? Where are we ? - This is Moreau 's Island . There 's been a change of plans . [ MONTGOMERY CAPTAIN SPEAKING in foreign LANGUAGE ] You 've gotta come with us . - Well , maybe I should stay on here . - If you come ashore , we 've got a radio and we 'll get you off the island in a couple days . Of course , the choice is yours . You can stay on the boat here , but these guys are real party animals . Captain Penari here has taken quite a shine to you , if you know what I mean . It 's really best if you come with me . Can I give you a hand with the rest of the things ? No , that 's all right . The others will take it . The others ? The islanders ? Yes , the islanders . DOUGLAS : How did this get here ? MONTGOMERY : Well , the Dutch were the first whites to settle the island in 1 890 . They had a coffee plantation . And then the Americans took it over in World War Il . Japanese bought it and tried a hotel resort which went belly-up . I used to have a rabbit as a little boy called Keasey . Died from my own neglect , I 'm sorry to say . I 've never been very good with animals . - Mm . He 's a beauty . - Mm-hm . He , she ... . What 's going on in your head ? Mm ? [ CHUCKLES ] Oh , good Lord ! [ sighs ] - Hold that . - Oh , please . [ ANIMAL GROWLING ] MONTGOMERY : We don 't actually eat meat here but I 'm sure the doctor will make an exception for you our special , unexpected guest . It 'll be our little secret , okay ? Come on . That 's a very impressive communications sensor . The only problem is nobody can fix it but me , and it was down before we left . I 'll get it up and running soon . Don 't worry . I 'm gonna have to ask you to restrict your movements to the main house . The people who fund this project are afraid you 're gonna sprain an ankle and sue us . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] Well , it 's a litigious world . Yes . Uh , stay right here . I won 't be long .

That 's another island . - Yes . - I 've read about it in many books . My name 's Edward Douglas . Edward Douglas . You have such beautiful hands . [ CHUCKLES ] - So beautiful . - Well , thank you . Are you from this island ? - My father brought me here . - Oh . Dr. Moreau ? And where are you from originally ? [ THUNDER rumbling ] Getting acquainted ? She 's beautiful . Yeah . She 's a pussycat . I 've arranged some quarters for you upstairs . Wonderful . I saw the Nobel Prize . I think I remember Moreau . Didn 't he vanish or something ? I thought he was dead . No . He 's still working . What exactly did he win his prize for ? He invented Velcro . I see . And how long has he been here ? Seventeen years . He became obsessed with his animal research . Animal rights activists drove him out of the States . It got so bad you couldn 't cage a rat without reading him his rights . [ CHUCKLES ] And how long have you been here ? I wrote a paper that was published and we started a correspondence . So about 1 0 years ago , I came out helped him with his work . Eventually ... . [ THUNDER rumbling ] [ CHUCKLES ] Let me show you to your room . Well , it 's very agreeable . Look , I don 't want to be an imposition here . And as soon as you can get this com sat equipment working I can , uh ... . They 'll send a plane for me .

These are all bad things . These are not the things that men do . We are men , are we not ? CREATURES : We are . We are men because the father has made us men ! Sayer of the Law .

MOREAU : Calm yourself , Mr. Douglas . Don 't add more pain to their already diminished lives . Why have you done this ? Don 't you feel the heat as I do ? I can 't tolerate the sun and what it 's doing to me , and what it 's doing to all of us to all life on earth . Heh , heh . We must return to the compound . Keep the weapon if it comforts you . Mr. Douglas , first of all , for the sake of propriety I would like to present my children . Hello . I am Waggoi . [ PANTS ] How do you do , sir . I 'm Azazello . My name is M 'Ling . MOREAU : You 've already met my beautiful daughter , Aissa . Majai , would you present yourself , please ? He means you no harm , Mr. Douglas . He 's just trying to be polite . He just wants to shake your hand . Thank you . This is the most outrageous spectacle I have ever witnessed . Look at yourself ! I understand that I must be shocking to you . However , I must also point out that I have an allergy to the sun , and that 's why I 've put this medication on . Look at these people ! [ AZAZELLO GROWLS ] Look at him ! [ sighs ] Mr. Douglas I don 't think that I have the intellectual ability to condense 1 7 years of study and experiment into 1 7 minutes of explanation . For the moment , it will have to suffice to say that the people that you witnessed before living under my care and protection are animals that have been fused with human genes in the course of a series of scientific studies designed by myself . Well , has it ever occurred to you you might have totally lost your mind ? I mean , this is just Satanic . Judge not , Mr. Douglas , that ye be not judged for by these judgments shall ye also be judged and let he who hath not sinned cast the first stone . There is no peace , saith the lord , unto the wicked . I think perhaps this is not the time to continue . We will have dinner at 8 : 00 . I hope that you 'll be in another state of mind to be slightly more receptive . [ MOREAU PLAYING CHOPlN 'S " POLONAlSE NO . 6 " ON piano ] [ MOREAU chuckling ] Oh !

" Oh . M 'Ling , that was just beautiful . Thank you so much . Shall we toast ? Your health . Thank you . Well , Mr. Douglas . very good of you to join us . Uh- - Please tell me . Is the devil still pursuing you ? [ BOTH laughing ] Well , perhaps you could explain to me what you mean by the devil . You seem to be on terms with him . Well , permit me , Mr. Douglas , to tell you something of the devil as I 've come to know him . The devil is that element in human nature that impels us to destroy and debase . And what are you about upon this island but destruction and debasement ? Oh , well , I can tell you very plainly . No , please don 't do that . For 1 7 years , I have been striving to create some measure of refinement in the human species , you see . And it is here , on this very island that I , sir , have found the very essence of the devil . What do you mean ? I have seen the devil in my microscope and I have chained him . And I suppose you could say , in a sense , metaphorically speaking I have cut him to pieces . The devil , Mr. Douglas , I have found is nothing more than a tiresome collection of genes . And it is with great assurance that I can tell you that Lucifer , son of morning is no more . [ CLEARS THROAT ] Well , I don 't see how any of this specious nonsense justifies these monstrous disfigurements . Well , very simply , they represent a stage in the process of the eradication of destructive elements found in the human psyche . And I have almost achieved perfection , you see of a divine creature that is pure , harmonious absolutely incapable of malice . And if in my tinkering , I have fallen short of the human form by the odd snout , claw , or hoof it really is of no great import . I am closer than you could possibly imagine , sir . Ah . Oh . Mm . What is that ? AZAZELLO : Rabbit fricassee , master . Stop that ! Oh , God ! Get this out of my sight ! Azazello , who 's responsible for this ? Uh , Mr. Montgomery requested it . Go into the kitchen . Leave . All of you , go into the kitchen and wash your hands . Mr. Montgomery considers this a sort of amusement , I suppose . No one saw me kill it except you . Well , I have no way of knowing . What do you mean ? We saw one in the forest with its head torn off . - And who was responsible for that ? - It was Lo-Mai . Good God . You bloody fool .

To go on two legs is very hard . Perhaps four is better anyway . DOUGLAS : This is a true record of what I saw . I set it down leaving out only the latitude and longitude of the island as a warning to all who would follow in Moreau 's footsteps . Most times , I keep the memory far in the back of my mind a distant cloud . But there are times when the little cloud spreads until it obscures the sky . At those times , I look about me at my fellow man and I 'm reminded of some likeness to the beast people and I feel as though the animal is surging up in them and they 're neither wholly animal nor wholly man but an unstable combination of both . as unstable as anything Moreau created . And I go in fear . [ English - US - SDH ]

 I will change my opinion if someone offers a better one . Until then , I am leaving Moya at the next planet with shipping traffic . Pass me those and don 't help yourself . We are stronger as the sum of our parts , kids . We are under no obligation to function as a unit , John . Yeah , I understand that . We all have separate goals . But ... ugh ! Oh , sala manila , what the hell is that ? That 's krawldar . A delicacy , even for pagans . Yeah ? How long was it under your butt getting delicate ? Aeryn : Wait a minute . Whatever the rest of you decide , I will not abandon Moya . Crichton : Good . D 'Argo : Suit yourself . You 've got nowhere to go anyway . I must confess my consternation at agreeing with D 'Argo . But if Moya is no longer able to Starburst then we are all at risk . Mmm ? Can I say something ? Everyone else : No ! Look , Moya has been very good to us and now you want to abandon her ? I want to see my son . And that is not likely to happen aboard a pregnant bio-mechanoid ship . Zhaan : Rygel , what do you think ? Rygel : Well , Moya has been , for as long as I can remember , our protector , our home , our companion and our friend . Crichton : Amen . However , as relationships grow , they also change . Do you think we can trade her for a faster vessel ? Moya is not a possession , your lowness . ( hissing ) lf you ignore the messenger , which is effortless , the message is sound . Perhaps we have outgrown our usefulness of ... Look , who made this shellack ? The recipe called for chicken . All I had was space rodent . Moya is protecting her baby , D 'Argo . Do you blame her ? That is selfishness masquerading as reason . He 's right , you know . We all want to leave the Uncharted Territories and return home , but you ... Yes , you would be more content to stay . I want to get home as badly as anybody else and this is where the wormholes are . Fine . So , stay . But be honest about your motives , Crichton . Oh , I 'm sorry . You 're on their side now ? No . I know I just got here , but can I please say something ? Everyone else : No ! Pilot : Excuse the intrusion , but Moya and I would like a word about your deliberations . That 's what I been trying to tell you guys . The DRDs have ears . No wonder you guys have been flying around in circles . Moya is aware of your concerns over her condition and regrets not being more responsive to your needs . Please don 't misunderstand , Pilot . We simply ... Do not wish to be captured because of her pregnancy . Yes . We 're just having a discussion , Pilot . That includes thoughts of abandoning us . You want us to stay ? Of course . We are most fulfilled when serving others . Your presence is gratifying and comforting . Let us talk a little while longer , Pilot . Your points are well-taken . You may talk all you want , but please prepare for immediate Starburst . I .. I thought Moya couldn 't Starburst for another 50 arns . Her energy is low . However , she shares your concerns about being recaptured and wishes to prove to you all that she is capable . Uh , no , that .. that won 't be necessary , Pilot . Starburst in five microts . D 'Argo : Now , this really is incredible . Rygel : My favourite on the table . Aeryn : What ? Smoked pronga sinew . It 's quite easy to make , really . ( explosion ) Whoa ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . ( rumbling ) You all right ? We must 've hit something . In Starburst ? Ugh . What 's that noise ? Chiana : Zhaan ! Zhaan ! Are you okay ? It 's my arm . The fibers are torn . Pilot , what 's happening ? Crichton : Pilot ? Pilot ! Pilot ! I 'm all right , Chiana. I 'll heal . Where 's Rygel ? - Rygel ? - Where is he ? Rygel ! What the hell is that ? I 'll check Command . You look after Pilot and you ... you do damage assessment . D 'Argo ! D 'Argo ? He can 't just disappear like that . Pilot or Command ? Command . You , fix her arm and then straight to Command . Go . Aeryn ! Zhaan : John , what 's happening ? I don 't want to die . Pilot , are you there ? Crichton , where are the others ? You tell me . What happened ? I 'm unsure . Still running analysis . is that a star ? Unknown . Attempting to close radiation filters ... now . D 'Argo , Aeryn and Rygel have disappeared . What happened ? Did we hit something ? Still unknown . Quantify " disappeared . " Here one second , gone the next . Disa-Elvis has left the building-appeared . These readings are all over the map . Whatever 's happened , most systems are out . Propulsion , guidance , comms . Even my DRDs aren 't responding . This is nuts . Nothing seems to be working . How 's Moya ? Frightened , and in great pain . What is that out there ? I will labor to discover that once the DRDs reestablish internal tracking . I show Rygel on Tier Eight and Officer Sun in Maintenance Bay Three . Still searching for D 'Argo . Keep looking . I said no , Chiana ! You can 't stop me . I know how to fly a Transport Pod , and I 'm getting off this ship . Not without everyone else , you 're not . How 's the arm ? Oh , useless until the fibres regenerate . Pilot 's found Aeryn and Rygel . Does he know what 's happening ? Not yet , and he 's still a little freaked out , so he could probably use some company . Okay , I 'll go straight to the den . Whoa ! The comms don 't work . Rygel is on Tier Eight . You 'll have to find him on foot . Me ? ! Get frelled . Listen sunshine , you want to be part of this crew ? On your good days . This is one of the good days . I thought you were junior Miss Tough Chick of the Universe . Yeah , when I can kiss or kick or cry my way out of it . This is way , way , way , way different . You bet your ass it is . And Pilot can 't get the outer doors open , so you can fly that pod around on its pad . Chiana , it 's going to be okay . Pilot 's on the job . Tier Eight ? Rygel . Crichton : Aeryn ! Aeryn , where are you ? Oh come on , Aeryn . Give me some kind of sign . ( rumbling ) Pilot ! Aeryn , are you here ? ( groaning ) What the hell is this light ? ( groaning ) ( garbled ) : Aeryn ! Pilot ! Zhaan ! Pilot ... ( garbled ) : Pilot ? Pilot . is anybody here ? Come on , is anybody here ? ( groaning ) Crichton ... ( gasping ) Crichton ! ( gasping ) I ... I can 't ... I can 't ... Crichton ... That 's the same noise ... That 's the same noise as the Maintenance Bay . ( grunts ) ( grating , high-pitched whine throughout ) ( obscured by whine ) : Aeryn ! Aeryn ! What the hell ? Aeryn ? Hey . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! You almost gave me a heart attack ! You okay ? Can you hear me ? Nothing . You . You all right ? You okay ? My head 's hurting . Yeah . Yeah . Have you found D 'Argo ? What ? D 'Argo ! No , I haven 't . Have you seen ... Rygel ? Come with me . There are doors between the Moyas . This way . Come on . Watch . Watch . Crap ! What ? Yeah . " Look for D 'Argo . " Yeah . Rygel . Yeah . ( grating whine continues ) ( roaring ) ( roaring ) Aeryn ! ( shrieking ) : Aeryn ! Well , look at you ! ( bellowing with laughter ) Rygel . ( laughing continuously ) Yellow light . Doesn 't hurt . Can hear . This is .. this is good . ( continues laughing ) What 'd so damn funny ? You . You . You 're making less sense than usual , but in a cute way . " Cute " ? I don 't know what you 've been smoking , buckwheat , but we 've got a serious problem here . Nothing a good meal won 't solve , I 'm sure . ( laughing ) What is up with you ? Up ? Everything 's up . Everything 's up-up-up ! Rygel , listen to me . Moya has a serious problem . Whatever she hit caused some kind of ... kind of fracture , I don 't know . I mean , we 're all here but we 're not in the same time or place in space . ( guffaws ) Have you seen D 'Argo ? D 'Argo ? I don 't know . Nobody 's here , not even Pilot . It was quite frantic at first . Then I realized I quite liked being on my own . ( laughs ) Yeah , that 's the way I usually prefer you , too , but right now we stick together . And then the Trawlian Priest turns to the Calanese Cleric and says , " Doesn 't bother me . You should have seen her mother ! " ( both laughing ) No , no , no , no , no . His mother ? Oh , oh , what am I doing ? Entering into the spirit of things , I 'd say . Rygel , Rygel , look around at this place . Do you remember what happened ? Yes . Nobody liked my cholian curd salad . ( both roaring with laughter ) No , no , no , no , no . Afterwards . There was a collision . Yes . There was a collision . Yes . But we survived , so why worry ? There 's .. there 's something happening to Moya and to us . You don 't make jokes . No . No , I don 't tell jokes . ( both laughing ) and I don 't laugh at them . It 's .. it 's this place ! It 's doing something to us . Yes , yes , it is doing something to us . But we 'll both feel better once we 've eaten . ( laughing ) Where there 's a way in , there 's a way out . ( shrill whirring noise ) Hey , Guido , did you see that ? Yes. I did . It was a hallucination , Crichton . Just an hallucination . It was real , Rygel. lt was real . I mean , we both saw it . Hmm , but it didn 't come back , and it didn 't hurt us , didn 't take the food . We have to find a way out of here . It 's hard to find . You got to listen for a weird , strange noise . Something out of the ordinary . Hmm . Weird noise . Does my stomach count ? ( laughing ) No , that 's not funny . That is not funny , Rygel . Look , I got to get out of here before I end up like you . What ? Handsome , with a great sexual prowess . ( laughing ) Shut up ! Just shut up ! Shh ! Shh ! No ! I got to get out of here . Either help me , help me . Hmm . ( laughing ) Leave me alone ! I 'll be in the galley with the food and the monster ! ( roars with laughter ) ( laughing ) ( squeaking , clicking noise ) There 's my noise . ( noise intensifies ) okay , Alice . Once more into the looking glass . ( giggles ) ( laughing ) We can 't find them , Pilot . False information yet again . The DRDs still show Officer Sun on Tier Two , Rygel outside the Centre Chamber , D 'Argo in ... Competent . You got it wrong , four arms , they 're nowhere . Your inability to locate them does not negate the fact that they are there . Oh . Then why can 't we see them ? Because ... Because you don 't have X-ray vision , do you ? John , where have you been ? Right here . Pilot , what do you know about parallel realities ? Temporal shifts . Two objects occupying the same space at the same time . More information , please . There are at least three other Moyas right here , right now . Do you know the mathematical hypothesis , Dimensional Schism ? Light and sound disjointed into base elements . Red , blue , yellow . Hypotheses don 't just materialize , Pilot . Tell us what 's happened to us . Starburst is technically the seam between space-time dimensions . Moya 's power cells allow us access , and we simply ride out the energy stream until we 're pushed out , at random . Chiana : Pushed out at random ? Not now , Chiana . What do you mean , not now ? We go into this Starlurch thing and we don 't even know where we 're going ? At the next appropriate moment , you 're welcome to leave . Oh . Tell us what happened , Pilot . In her haste to accommodate so you wouldn 't abandon us , Moya entered Starburst without adequate thrust . At the moment , we appear to be ... stuck . Crichton : Wild guess here , we 're still in Starburst ? Regrettably , our insertion vector was wrong and subsequent fluctuations ... Screw the science lesson , Pilot . You should have told us that we 're still in Starburst . Now we are stuck into what ? Whatever 's on the other side . Chiana : You saw a creature ? What kind of creature ? The kind we eat or the kind that that eats us ? is it possible that you saw a fragment from another dimension , John ? If what Pilot says is accurate , yeah . I 've always wondered what could be beyond height and width , depth and time . Nausea . Spirituality . That 's a good wish . Pilot says we don 't have enough power to pull free . What are we going to do ? First thing , protect ourselves in case that creature is the " eat us " kind . You two find some weapons . I 'm going to work with Pilot . What do you have in mind ? Get the others . Bring them back . Pilot : Follow the sequence exactly , when the ion backwash reaches maximum , funnel it all to reverse propulsion . I 'll try . Any deviation will result in failure . I 'll still try . Look , Pilot , why is Moya being schismed off by this deal ? But not you , me , the others ? Relative densities . The heavier the substance , the more pronounced the fissure . Even now , connected to Moya as I am , the effects are becoming noticeable . And we are being drawn further in by the moment . And when we get pulled apart ? Molecular diaspora . You know , Pilot , Moya did not have to go into Starburst until she was ready . Now is hardly the time for recriminations , Commander . It wasn 't a recrimination . We should have been more up-front about our feelings . How 's she doing ? Same as us , scared . Well , we 'll do what we can . She knows . Crichton : You 'll be happy to know we have a plan . I 'll be happier to know if it works . First thing , we find the others . " We " ? We 're going with you ? D 'Argo and the others may be injured , Chiana . Do I get a say in this ? - No . - No . Look out ! ( shrill whirring ) We stay together , the whole way , Chiana . No roaming . Chiana : Yes , mother . Crichton : No , Mom , plan has changed . You stay here with Pilot . If that creature comes back , just ... shoot it . Even I was still a full Pa 'u , I wouldn 't hesitate . Right here . You ready , Pip ? Uh , Pip means ? My favorite traveling companion . Before I got here , did they believe anything you said ? Aah ! ( moaning ) I thought you said this red light hurt your head . Huh ... it does . Well , not to me . I 'm so glad . Come on . Let 's get ... D 'Argo ! You 're alive . D 'Argo : Barely . This light affects thinking and motor functions . Not to me . I saw you earlier on . What the hezmana happened to you ? That 's way too much to go into right now . Suffice it to say that Moya had a little problem during Starburst . She 's wedged herself into another dimension and split off into at least four distinct parts . Have you ever heard of anything like this happening before ? D 'Argo , I haven 't heard of anything like anything before . My planet doesn 't even go to the Moon anymore . I 've heard of it . My people 's weapons scientists once ... once poked a hole through another dimension . Once it widened , they lost control . Yeah , and what happened ? No one 's sure , but a whole solar system , four populated planets , dissolved into tiny chunks . That 's why I want to get out of here . We will . Does that thing help ? Barely. I only wretch every once in awhile now . Look , we got to get the engines started in each of Moya 's four incarnations in order to get out of here . Pilot isn 't here to operate them . It 's all right ; he told me what to do . ( screaming ) ( roaring ) I was going to tell you about that . Chiana : Look ! He 's trying to come through from the other side . Let 's discourage it . You know how to use that thing ? I 'm scared grotless , not stupid . One , two ... fire ! What happened to three ? ! We did it . It does not feel like a victory . Not at all . No , no , no , button , then lever slide . Look , I can stay . You go get Aeryn and Rygel . You are in no condition . Well , you 've been here longer . You can barely stand . Now you . You say that this light doesn 't affect you ? Yeah . No . No . Yes , this light doesn 't affect me . No , I won 't stay alone . And , no , I won 't stay alone . Just take the girl . I 'll be okay . Well , you know how to get out in case something goes wrong ? Yes , above the strategy table . Now go . Alright , give us half an arn , then fire up everything in reverse . I remember from the first seven times that you told me . Aah ! Not here ! Go ! Go ! I do not want that here . Ooh ... Chiana : Doesn 't affect me . Are you sure about this ? Just go up . What if the creature 's waiting ? Then piss it off . How ? Pretend it 's me . ( both grunt ) ( grating , high-pitched whine ) ( screaming ) ( screaming continues ) ( high-pitched whine continues ) ( roaring ) ( pulse pistol firing ) ( high-pitched humming muffled ) Hey , mu ... much better . You all right ? Aeryn , this is genius . I modified flight headsets to block out acoustic wavelengths , that 's all . It 's not bad for the girl who hates to do homework . Well , it 's military tech ; it 's battle tested . Why did you not shoot at that thing ? I don 't know . You don 't ... ? Brilliant instinct , Crichton . Have you seen my prowler ? Oh yeah. I was here for that show . You missed it ? Look , Pilot thinks Moya 's been wedged into another dimension . That thing 's trying to get into ours . Yeah . Have you found the others ? Well , Moya 's separated off into separate environments , D 'Argo 's in one , Rygel 's somewhere else , and we 're here . Clearly , you found a route to get through . Yeah , but it 's not going to matter if we get sucked in any farther . is there a plan ? Yep . Well ? Pilot needs more power . All the engines have to be on full reverse at the same time . That should have been the first thing you told me , Crichton . Yeah , no , I know. I was busy . Aeryn , wait , wait , wait . Let me show you what to do . I know the sequence for full reverse . Get on to the others . Pilot was pretty specific about what he wanted . I have some of Pilot 's DNA , remember ? Pilot was very specific . Rotate blue crystal , trim yellow disk , extinguish orange light , open copper rods , ( both ) black panel depressed halfway , dial tri-connector open , hot progression purple , green , orange , gold lights , green knob , maximum thrust . It 's going to be harder to doubt you in the future . Well , I apologize for my strengths . Give me half an arn and then fire it up ! Got it ! ( moans ) Chiana ? ! Sparky ? ! Sparky ? ! Careful , careful , don 't slip and fall and die ! Aah ... ( laughing ) I 'm so glad to see you two are safe . Well , he said you 'd have that look on your face . Well , I was worried about you . Well , I found Rygel and I managed to bring him here . Then we started talking and ... Do you know any good jokes ? Not besides the one I 'm living . Oh , all right , Mr. Serious , what 're you doing ? Putting Moya 's propulsion system into full reverse . Hmm ? Oh ! Reverse ? Hah ! No Dominar from the House of Rygel ever travels in reverse . Well , turn around and pretend you 're going forward . ( Chiana and Rygel laughing ) You stay here with Napoleon . If for any reason the engines shut down , restore the green knob . Ignore the green slob . ( Chiana chuckling ) Restore the green knob . You do that , I 'll let you take a Transport down to the next planet , okay ? Crichton , that 's outrageous . Green knob . Green knob . Good girl . Hang tough , Sparky . Enjoy the personality . ( both laughing ) Oh , there is no expanse of the mind the will cannot traverse , or physically the distance laid across the universe . There 's blessings many in the stars save one lamented curse , that Sixteenth Rygel , glory me , must travel in reverse ! ( both laughing hysterically ) There 's a little dance that goes with that , but I can 't do them both at the same time . ( laughing ) ( laughing ) Aah ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! I wish people would stop pointing guns at me . When you didn 't show , I was beginning to think I was in the wrong place . Pilot reports full reverse power . You did it , John . What about the creature ? Well , I keep shooting at it but it keeps coming back . Well , we 've got to hold it off until Pilot can get us out of here . Your vestments ? I suddenly realised I had forsaken priesthood in practise but not in my soul . Why did you put them on now ? I ... I fear we may die here soon . Whole sections of the ship are being swallowed up . Pilot , it 's getting worse . Crichton . Pilot , report . Not good . Despite Moya 's best efforts we 're still being drawn in . There is one very long shot . Anything , Pilot . Moya could willingly , lose the baby . - No . - No way . It will definitely increase her power quotient though I am not sure if it is enough to get us free . Pilot , no . We cannot ask Moya to make that sacrifice . We should not have attempted Starburst when we did . Our insecurities have brought us to this place . Besides , the baby cannot survive if we don 't . Pilot , listen to me . Whatever happens , we go together . We keep the baby . ( roaring ) John ! Shoot it ! Moya is very scared . Please shoot it ! Don 't fire . It 's coming through . John , the hole 's widening . Prime numbers . These scratches are grouped in prime numbers . Three , five , seven , eleven , prime ! It 's trying to communicate . You bet your blue ass . This isn 't an attack , Zhaan . It 's an invitation . I urge you to shoot it ! It 's trying to communicate . I know it . It 's not attacking . John , no ! What if the hole closes up ? Then I 'll be dead a few minutes before you . That 's all . ( echoing ) : Who are you ? Female voice : Unimportant . Your container has breached our existence . is that where l am ? In your dimension ? There can be no overlap . This is the expanse between . Your mental organ is unable to interpret the chasm to your existence . ( laughing ) You got that right , pal . My function is to repair breaches . Does this happen a lot ? Never before with living material . Bad news , pal . We are living . Can you help us get out ? I must destroy all material . The breach is fatal . Whoa , whoa , hang on , give us a chance . We 're .. we 're trying to back out . That path will tear the rupture beyond restoration . So what are you saying ? There 's no way ? Forward . Forward ? I thought you said we can 't exist in your existence . I will attempt to conduct you back to the space you began . Starburst . I can guide . You must provide your own thrust , forward . Wait , wait , wait ! What if we don 't have enough power ? Forward . Wait ! Did you hear it ? Did you hear it ? Zhaan : Hear what ? You barely got your head inside the hole and out again before it closed . The creature , I talked to it . Commander , there wasn 't time . There was for me . You got to tell Moya to stop resisting . She has to go forward . Starburst forward . I will not . We don 't have a choice . Look , you tell me what to do and I 'll relay it to the others . Pilot , trust me . Reverse the final four controls . Right . Give me 500 microts , then go . John . John , what if you 're wrong ? Oh , you were going to pray anyway . Pilot : 500 ... 499 ... - 498 . - 498 ... 472 ... 471 ... 470 ... D 'Argo : The engines are in full reverse . Did it work ? ( retching ) Aw ... Oh ... Shut it down . Wrong direction . We have to go forward . No , that is suicide . Uh-uh , no , no , no , it 's the same control sequence . Just reverse the last four commands . Look , can you explain to me how you arrived at this decision ? No . No , no time . Just wait 300 microts , then forward . I have no time-keeping device . One-mississippi-one , one-mississippi-two , one-mississippi-three , 300 , forward . ( panting ) One-mippippippi ... two-mippippippi ... three-mippippippi ... four-mippippippi ... Aeryn ? Aeryn , you there ? Ah , where have you been ? On the run . Where are you ? I 'm trying to get out of here . I didn 't know if you were coming back . I 'd never leave you . Something the matter ? Yeah . We got it wrong . We have to go forward . Just tell me what I have to do . 150 microts from now , full maximum thrust . You know how to do that ? Yes , of course I do . Good . Hey look , this dimension thing 's chopping up the whole ship . You know a way I can get to quarters ? Well , the lower levels are gone . You might want to try Tier Seven through the lon Backwash Chamber . I 'm going to head back to Pilot 's . 150 microts . 130 now , good luck . Back at you , baby . ( loud whining whir ) fifty-two ... fifty-one ... fifty ... ( Rygel laughing ) Rygel : Oh , there you are ! The other runners came through here arns ago ! Still auditioning for Star Search , I see . No. I have a new philosophy , Crichton . What used to be important isn 't and what should be important , never will be . Great , that way when this whole thing screws up and we die , you 're not going to be whinging in my ear , right ? ( laughing ) 12 ... 1 1 ... Hey , why don 't you relax ? Join in the fun ? Give me seven seconds , baby . We 'll come or go together . Four ... three ... two ... one ... ( laughing ) ( deep rumbling ) Whoa ... Oh hell , we 're screwed . ( laughing ) ( grunts ) Should I disrobe so it 's memorable ? Yes . ( rumbling intensifying ) ( yelling and grunting ) ( grunting ) ( laughing ) ( gasps ) I 'm alive ! ( laughing ) ( all laughing ) ( sighs ) I fail to see the source of your amusement . ( laughing continuing ) ( all laughing ) Crichton : No , no , no , you did not say that . I did . I was very shameless in my youth . And that worked ? Of course not . The girl screamed and I was almost arrested . And when they didn 't give it back , we beat the gris out of them . ( Zhaan laughing ) Should I be telling you this ? Zhaan : My dear I 've kicked more ass than you 've sat on . ( laughing ) Oh , yes , I spent all evening listening to them gripe and whine about me , but of course , they didn 't realize I was their Dominar . I admire your openness to criticism , Rygel . When did you tell them who you were ? At their trial , of course . ( laughing ) Everyone , is it just me , or is this the best food that we have ever had ? Mmm , nothing like the taste of death to clear the palate , huh ? I suppose there isn 't a thing here that I couldn 't live on for a cycle . Except ... except maybe this . Now I was assuming that because of the lack of taste in that , that it was a garnish . Hey , hey , hey , those are Grandmother Crichton 's famous buttermilk biscuits . Rygel : What 's in them ? Self-raising flour , ah , salt , shortening , buttermilk , touch of honey . But we have none of those ingredients , John . Yeah , maybe that 's the problem . ( laughing ) Pilot : I 'm sorry to interrupt your meal , but how can you all be so jovial after our near-miss ? We were affected profoundly by it , Pilot . How are you two handling it ? Well enough to alleviate your concerns about our Starburst problems . There 's been a change in the status of Moya 's baby . is she in any danger ? Doing fine . Actually , more than fine . We 're going to have a baby ? Yes . There 's no exact timetable for Leviathan gestations , but Moya feels confident the day is coming . Oh-ho ! Well , in that case , tell her if she 's so inclined , when it is born she can name it after me . That would only work if it was a runt . Watch it , girly ! Crichton : This is one of the good days , people . To a healthy , happy baby ! Rygel : Hear , hear ! Thanks . ( others laughing ) Rygel ... No , no , no ! Ew ! ( spitting )

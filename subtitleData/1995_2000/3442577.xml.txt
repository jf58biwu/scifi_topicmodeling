You don 't touch anything of mine . - l drew it for you . - You don 't draw on anything . You understand ? What- - This is my boat . I got it the way I like it . You take up space and you slow me down . You know , she 's just a little girl . - She doesn 't know your rules . - You wanna stay ? You teach her . Enola , what 'd I tell you ? You 're not so tough . You know that ? How many people have you killed ? Ten ? Twenty ? - You talk a lot . - l talk a lot ' cause you don 't talk at all . Now how many ? - including little girls ? - l 'm not afraid of you . I told Helen you wouldn 't be so ugly if you cut your hair .

She said she was sorry ! That means you 're supposed to say something back ! - Did you say somethin ' ? - [ Enola ] Mm-mmm . [ Deacon ] The child- - did he have the girl with him ? - [ Pilot ] Uh-huh . - Seems to me if we launch now , we can cut him down just about here . - lf he doesn 't change course . - Ah , it 's not likely . He 's a wily one , that ichthy-demon . Yeah , if he knows he 's been spotted , he 'll expect us to expect him to change course , which is exactly why he 'll keep his heading . The important question is , where 's he heading ? And does he know how precious his cargo is ? I say that he 's headed here , and we take him here . [ Drifter Shouting ] - Drifter ? - Mm-hmm . - [ Shouting Continues ] - [ Helen ] Are we gonna stop ? - Look at the flag ! - His flag 's up . I thought you all stopped for each other .

Give me that . What are you doin ' ? It 's just a game . 0h , I , um- - l , uh- - We was just playin ' . The trade 's off . I changed my mind . Well , um- - Well , you can 't do that .

Happy now ? - - [ Humming ] - - [ Humming Continues ] You don 't like my singing , do you ? Helen says you don 't like my singing 'cause you can 't sing . - Ever try and listen ? - To what ? The sound of the world . - l don 't hear anything . - That 's because you 're too loud , and you 're movin ' around all the time . Try sitting ' still . Eyeball ? I wish I had feet like his . Then maybe I could swim . Enola . [ Burps ] Sorry . Never met a person couldn 't swim before . I can 't . People say I was weird . Maybe they were right . Maybe they were right about you too . Enola wanted to give you this . And this . She won 't take it again . You don 't look much like her . - Well , I 'm not her mother , if that 's what you 're asking . - You act like it . What are those marks on her back ? Nothing . They 're just fanciful things . - Like what she draws ? - She draws what she sees . She 's like a mirror . People on the atoll thought she was a- - Freak ? Uh-huh . Yeah . I just thought she was special . I 'm not givin ' it to her. lt 's just- - A loan . Yeah.

[ Whispers ] All right . - l winged him . - l say we load ... all the go-juice onto one boat and run the freak down . You can 't catch him in ten boats , and you wanna send just one ? Well , I pray that you 're jokin ' . Bring me the trackers . He 's hurt . It 's not what you think . They weren 't after her . - l saw what I saw . - What ? No more lies . - [ Shrieks ] - What are the marks on her back ? People say it 's the way to Dryland . Dryland 's a myth ! No ! You said so yourself that you know where it is . You did . You 're a fool to believe in something you 've never seen before . I 've seen it. I 've touched it ! Dirt that was richer and darker than yours . It was in the basket we found Enola in ! - lt doesn 't exist ! - Well , how can you be so sure ? Because I 've sailed farther than most have dreamed , and I 've never seen it . But the things on your boat ! " Things on my boat " what ? There are things on your boat that nobody has ever seen ! What are these shells ? And that reflecting glass ? And th-the music box ? That- - Well , if not from Dryland , then where ? Wh-Where ? You wanna see Dryland ? You really wanna see it ? I 'll take you to Dryland .

[ Men Yelling , Cheering ] Proper introductions first . I 'm the Deacon . [ Men Laughing ] lf you don 't recall the face , perhaps it 's ' cause I didn 't always look like this . Now , ahem , I suspect she 's somewhere real close . So we can tear this boat apart lookin ' for her , but I 'd rather somebody tell me where she is . And the first one that does that , lives . And the runner-up- - Well , actually , there are no runners-up . 0h , sweet Joe , I love this part . Choose ' em . 0ne , two . Live or die .

Careful with her ! - What about them ? - Do ' em both . Torch the boat . We have to go under ! No , I can 't breath like you ! I 'll breathe for both of us . [ Man ] Whoo ! [ Enola ] Helen !

Now they 're yours ... if you help me with just one problem , all right ? Now , ahem- - Now that tattoo on your back- - Ahem . I 've been told that , uh- - that 's actually a map ? It 's the way to Dryland . Now we 're gettin ' someplace . Could you teach me how to read that ? Setback . Well , have you ever heard any of your friends talk about it ? You know , like your mommy or your pet fish ? Did he say anything ? You shouldn 't make fun of him . He wouldn 't like it . Girl , I don 't give a shit what he 'd like . He took out my eye . And if I ever see him again , I 'm gonna cut open his head and eat his brains ! You think he 'd like that ? Can 't kill him . He 's even meaner than you are . But he 's not here . And he ain 't comin ' . And no one 's gonna save you . He 'll come for me . He will . Then you better tell me what I wanna know or he can see what 's left of you ... in a goddamn jar . We 're going to die here , aren 't we ? Aren 't we ? After the atoll , when I offered myself to you , why didn 't you take me ? 'Cause you didn 't really want me . Not really . Have I been asleep long ? I was dreaming . It 's funny . I always thought Dryland floated . That it drifted with the wind . That 's why it was so hard to find . Why did you believe in it so much ? Because we weren 't made for the sea . Got hands ... and feet . We 're supposed to walk . I miss her sound . Don 't you ? [ Gregor ] Helen ! He- - No , no , no . Helen , up here . Above you ! - [ Chuckling ] - [ Helen ] Gregor ! [ Chuckling Continues ] Smart thinking to burn your boat . Without the smoke , I never would have found you . Who 's that with you ? lchthyus Sapien , is that really you ? I 'll throw the rope down . You catch it. I 'll help you climb up . Helen . Where 's Enola ? Smokers took her . They 'd have me too if it weren 't for him . My friend , thank you . Very human of you . Go grab your things quickly . Quickly . Come . [ Gregor ] You see ? Right down there . There 's several of us survivors . We 'll just start over again . [ Man ] You can 't ask us to go get her ! [ Woman ] Enola 's the reason we 're in all this trouble . [ Helen ] They don 't have any reason to kill her . They need to find Dryland just like we do . - 0f course . - [ Helen ] lf the Mariner 's willing to go , why not us ? [ Woman ] lf he wants to go , then let him ! [ Woman # 2 ] We don 't want you here ! You or the girl ! Helen . The papers the Mariner brought you- - lt 's the same language the tattoo is written in . They 're numbers . - [ Man ] Gregor , you 're as crazy as she is ! - [ Woman ] We can 't stay here ! We 're wasting valuable time . More Smokers will come . We need to be moving now ! My friends , don 't you see we need this child if we want to find Dryland ? - l 'm not goin ' . - Nobody is . [ Woman ] We 've seen their smoke on the horizon ! - Know what that is yet ? - The numbers ? Yes , I think I do . It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location : latitude , longitude . It doesn 't make sense , though . The numbers , they seem to be backwards or something . - lt 's upside down . - The world ? The poles have reversed themselves ? I 've been mapping ' the cities below . The world wasn 't created in a deluge . It was covered by it . - [ Man ] That 's blasphemy ! - [ Helen ] No , it 's true . I 've seen it with my own eyes . There is land . It 's right under our keel . - None of it 's dry anymore . - Some is . Enola 's been there . I know that now. I saw what she drew . So that 's why he 's going after Enola- - to find Dryland . I don 't care about Dryland . This is ridiculous . Going after the Smokers ? He doesn 't even know which direction they came from . - [ Man ] I say let him go . - [ Woman ] We 're better off without them anyway ! If she 's alive , I 'll bring her back to you . [ Woman ] Forget the mute-o , Helen . If he brings her back , they 'll kill us ! I can 't stand it . We gotta go help him . I can 't ask him to do this alone . 0h , don 't worry , my dear . You 're not going to have to . [ Deacon ] You got that tattoo figured out yet ? It would be easier if it was flat- - big and flat . - lt needs to be flat . - What you got in mind ? Well , you cut it off her back . You stretch it , mount it . - Give us a proper look . - Take her down below until I holler . Saint Joe , we 're close . After centuries of shame . [ Scraping ] [ Distant Shouting ] [ Distant Laughter ] [ Crowd Shouting ] - They 're gettin ' ugly . - Don 't I know it . Announce me , cousin . [ Crowd Chanting ] - [ Microphone Popping ] - Hey . Here he is . [ Crowd ] Deacon ! Rise up , brothers and sisters . Turn your eyes and open your hearts ... to your humble benefactor , your spiritual shepherd and dictator for life , the Deacon of the ' Deez . [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Cheering Continues ] - Look out ! - lt 's mine ! It 's mine ! [ Confused Shouting ] - Deacon ! - Wahoo ! Children . Children of the provider . Citizens of the good ship . Please now , hear me speak . - l 've had a vision . - [ Man ] Yeah , we 're tired of your visions ! What about the land you promised us ? [ Crowd ] Yeah ! Yeah ! [ Deacon ] 0 ye of little faith . I 've had a vision so great ... that as it came to me , I wept . - And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder , - ls that Bone 's ride ? - ls that blood on the seat ? - l saw- - And you know what it is that I saw . I saw ... the land . [ Cheering ] [ Gasping ] [ Crowd Chanting ] - Horse , that you ? - [ Engine Revving ] Look , just bring it in slow , okay ? I don 't have all day . - [ Engine Revs ] - Horse ! Just bring it up slow . I said slow ! [ Screams ] Shouldn 't be doing that . You 're gonna get in trouble . Ha . That 's right . You 're not afraid . You 've got your pet freak comin ' to rescue you . He 's not a freak , and he can take you anytime . He 's killed dozens of people , and he doesn 't have any mercy or anything . He even kills little girls . Haven 't we all ? Shit . It 's Horse . - Find him . Find him ! - Come on ! - [ Crowd Chanting ] - Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! - Come on . - Gettin ' nervous , aren 't you ? I don 't get nervous . [ Deacon ] And if there 's a river , we 'll dam it . And if there 's a tree , we 'll ram it . 'Cause I 'm talkin ' progress here . Yes , sir. I 'm talkin ' development . - [ Man ] Yeah ! - For we shall suck and savor ... the sweet flavor of Dryland . - [ Crowd Whistling ] - [ Enola ] Face is all red . - [ Deacon Continues Faintly ] - Helen said with anybody that has a face that red , he 's had too much sun or too much to drink . - All right , that 's it . I 'm gonna burn your face . - Almost time . - [ Clanging ] - What 's up ? - We 're just talkin ' about our friend . - [ Doctor ] What 's his name ? - [ Enola ] He doesn 't have a name . So death can 't find him . Nah-nah . Doesn 't have a home or people to care for . He 's not afraid of anything , men least of all . He 's fast and strong like a big wind . He can hear a hundred miles and see a hundred miles underwater . - [ Gagging ] - He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun . He could be right behind you , and you won 't even know it ' til you 're dead ! Give it a rest . He 'll come for me . He will . - [ Deacon Addressing Crowd ] We are the people- - - Yeah ? - Well , I hope he does . - [ Deacon ] The Lord 's creation . Remember you said that . [ Deacon Continues ] Look at us . - Look at us here today . - [ Man ] Yeah ! Dryland is not just our destination , but it is our destiny ! [ Cheering , Whistling ] Find him . Find him ! How can I find ... this glorious place ? And he said to me : " A child shall lead you . " A child . - And behold ! - lt 's time . The instrument of our salvation ! [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Deacon ] 0ur guide in the wild . [ Deacon ] 0ur beacon in the darkness . Turn her around , Nord . She has shown me the path ! [ Cheering ] And before the holy-most moment is upon us , let 's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe . And let 's get this tub of shit up to speed . Yep . [ Wild Cheering ] Pull ! - Pull ! - Pull ! - Pull . - Pull ! 0w . - So which way we rowing ' ? - l don 't have a goddamn clue . [ Laughs ] Don 't worry . They 'll row for a month before they figure out I 'm fakin ' it . But , um , wh-wh- - 0h , you want details . Well , I 'm not tellin ' these savages ... that we haven 't solved the map yet . I promised them results , and I 'll get ' em if I gotta cut ' em out of her goddamn back . Who is that ? Who is that ? Maybe one of the spare rowers ? Why aren 't you rowing ' ? - lt 's him . - lt is him . You guys are in so much trouble . Well , I 'll be damned . It 's the gentleman guppy . You know , he 's like a turd that won 't flush . I want the girl . You know , I thought you were stupid , friend . - [ Gun Cocking ] - But I underestimated you . You 're a total freakin ' retard . [ Laughing ] I want the girl . That 's all . Well , what on this screwed-up Earth makes you think you 're gonna get her ? You know what this is ? I drop it , you burn . - We all burn . - Now wait , wait , wait , wait . Ahem . Let 's not do anything rash here . I mean , uh , are you sure she 's worth all this ? She never does stop talkin ' . She never shuts up . - l noticed . - What is it then ? Huh ? It 's the map . She 's my friend . Golly gee . A single tear rolls down my cheek . I mean , you 're gonna die for your friend . If it comes to that . - He 's bluffing. I 'll kill him . - He 's not bluffing . He never bluffs . Shut up ! I don 't- - l-l- - l don 't think you 're gonna drop that torch , my friend . - Why not ? - Because you 're not crazy . No ! 0h , thank God . [ Screaming ] [ Gunfire ] [ Smoker ] Look out ! [ Screaming ] Get him ! Let 's go , goddamn it ! - [ Screaming ] - Don 't just stand there ! Kill somethin ' ! Was this your big vision ? [ Screaming ] 0h , yeah ! I 've always wanted to drive this monster . There he is ! There he is ! That 's him ! There ! [ Shrieks ] [ Screaming ] [ Enola ] No ! Let go ! [ Explosion ] [ Enola ] Let go ! - [ Enola ] Let me go ! Let go ! - [ Deacon ] Pilot ! - [ Deacon ] Pilot ! - [ Enola ] Let me go ! - [ Mariner Cocking Gun ] - Let go ! Let go-o-o-o ! [ Laughing ] You should 've stayed underwater . [ Clicks Twice ] 0h ! Now you know how to fly an airplane ? You 're lucky l do . 0w ! Now you stop it ! You behave yourself now ! [ Explosions ] - 0h ! - [ Mariner Grunting ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] [ Helen ] lt 's going down . - You can see it sinking . - Gregor , bring us right down on top of it . - Hurry , Gregor ! - [ Gregor ] Don 't worry . Hurry . [ Clanging , Rumbling ] Enola ! Up here ! Grab on ! [ Gregor ] Are they on yet ? - [ Gregor ] What is it ? - [ Helen ] I don 't know ! No ! Gotcha !

My friends , look . If I take a bearing from the sun and reverse the coordinates on Enola 's back , then Dryland is that way ! [ Sea Gull Chattering ] - [ Helen Laughing ] - lt 's fresh ! All of this ! It 's fresh ! [ Helen Shrieks ] [ Laughing ] No ! [ Laughing ] [ Helen ] Whoo ! Whoo ! I found something ! Maybe we should put them under the dirt . I think it was their way . [ Gregor ] They must have known they were dying . [ Helen Laughing ] [ Winding Key ] I 'm home . - Where 's the Mariner ? - He was outside . Wait . Wait ! I want to show you this . [ Birds Chirping Loudly ] [ Hoofbeats ] [ Whinnying ] [ Birds Twittering , Chirping ] First time in your life you got nothin ' to say ? Enola , I have to go now . But you came back for me . I like you . Why are you leaving ? - l don 't belong here . I belong out there . - You belong here . It 's too strange here . It doesn 't move right . Helen said that it 's only land sickness . We 're all feeling it . It 'll go away soon . It 's more than that .

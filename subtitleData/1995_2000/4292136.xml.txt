 Previously on the Pretender : I have been thinking a lot about my mom lately . Me too . Everyday . I 'm not like everyone else around here , I am not afraid of your father . Things haven 't been the same since they arrived here . You put a gun on me , no big deal . Cos I know you don 't have the rocks to pull the trigger . You are going to shoot me ? Cafeteria closed ? Ah , Miss Parker . Everyone 's supposed to leave the Centre for today 's fire security test . Then why are you playing with matches ? I don 't follow . Hayes , if you 're going to work for me , you need to understand three things . First , keep the tie straight . Second , get a new tie . And the third ? Candy 's for the clients . - What ? - Ah , there you are sweetheart . Daddy . - Is that you ? - Well , unless you 've got another father somewhere I don 't know about . Listen , I tried you at the house . What are you doing at the Centre on a Sunday , especially this Sunday . A false alarm on Jarod . Where are you ? About to get on a Centre helicopter . I 'll be at Blue Cove tonight . But your vacation ? I didn 't feel like laying around on a beach . I couldn 't forget what day this is . I 've been thinking a lot about your mother . - You have ? - Surprised ? Um , ah , It 's just that you 've never called me like this on this day , I mean . Well , when you get to where I am in life regrets start to eat you up . There are lots of things that I 've been meaning to say to you and to her for a long time . I 'm here , daddy , for you . Ah , be there at seven , will you ? I was just leaving for the cemetery but we could go and see mum together ? Yeah . For once there 'll just , just three of us . Wait for me . I 'll be at home . Daddy ... Mum , No ... Mum , no . I miss you , mum . The anniversary of a parent 's death can be a heavy cross to bear , especially alone . If you would like company at the cemetery ? Thanks but I won 't be bearing a cross alone this year . Your father ? I have visited my mother 's grave every year on the anniversary of her death but my father would never talk about it . Why is it people wait until the end of their lives before ... they ... face regrets ? Regret is born of a parried emotion . But your mother 's death is a wound , a wound that not even the Parkers can ignore forever . You 've never seen him grieve , have you ? Until you do , until you can share your grief with him , you will never heal . Daughter ... sad . Well , well , well . Look what the cat dragged in . Stealing office supplies ? Reviewing your past attempts to catch Jarod . Not pretty . Splash a little colour on , love . So depressing . - Daddy ? - Have you spoken to your father today ? What the hell do you want ? I want to help you . - Where are you now ? - I 'm leaving Blue Cove . - What is it Jarod ? - Turn around and get back to the Centre as fast as you can . Why ? Someone is going to kill your father . There are pretenders among us I was taken from my family . Thirty-Six Hours , he has already demonstrated more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke up , I spent every moment searching for my past . He is a pretender . A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Center wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and the abused . Life is a gift . THE PRETENDER Season 2 Episode 12 Toy Surprise YTET PRESENTS DICTATION : ± ¿ ± ¿ / ´ Ð ´ Ð You are a doctor ? I am , today . Someone has ordered your father 's assassination . My source says there 's a file in the Centre 's mainframe tagged " Arkham " . Apparently it explains everything . Jarod , this is the wrong day for games . I know what today is Miss Parker . The Centre took your mother away from you just like they took me away from mine . Don 't let them finish the job by killing your father . My father kept you in the Centre your entire life , Jarod . Why would you want to help him ? Because if he dies my answers die with him . And so do yours . Jarod , I don 't know about this . Mr Compty , I 've spoken with Chris 's former counsellors . We all agree . He 's ready for this climb both physically and mentally . I want to believe that hiking and mountain climbing are going to help but ever since Chris 's accident last year we 've tried therapists , retreats , vacations , everything . I just want the old Chris back . That 's why I 'm here . He 's just lost his best friend . It takes time to heal from that kind of pain . You spoke like a man who 's experienced some loss himself . I 'm not giving up on your son without a fight . Chris . Jarod Crockett . We 've got a tough trail ahead of us if we 're going to beat the others back to the base camp . Are you ready to climb this monster ? I 'm ready to go home . The truth is I 'd rather be home . I 'm missing my daughter 's dance class . The Arkham files , Broots . Focus . It would a lot of easier to find if I could use my workstation . I don 't know why we can 't use the tech room . Because the tech room is the first place they would look . Who ? There 's nobody here . People trying to kill my father . What ? - Oh God , I 'm sorry . - Now , you know what this is about . Ok . Arkham . - Have you been able to reach your father ? - His phone 's dead . So 's the radio on the chopper . He lands on the Tower 's helipad in four hours . Sydney when he called , he ... was reaching out to me . Be careful , Parker . He 's disappointed you before . Sydney , you were there the day that my mother was killed . Did you ever see him ... Grieve over her ? Tell me . Moments after she died , your father told me never to speak about it . not to you , Jarod , anyone . He ordered me back to work as if nothing had happened Then ... What ? Then he said , life goes on . Daughter sad . Everyone sad . Daughter sad . This compass isn 't working right . I think we 're lost . I think you 're right . Whatever , it 's not my fault . You have to report positions to me . We 're a team out here . We have to communicate . You guides are all the same . Always trying to bug me out . Bug you out ? Yeah , get me to communicate . You want me to talk about stuff . Back off . I don 't need your help . You don 't have to go through this alone . Just climb , ok ? Well , that might be easier than you think . " Jeep is dead , I have gone ahead to station . " You thinking what I 'm thinking ? What ? Short cut . We get this thing working . We take the fire trail out of here and we beat everybody to the cliff face . I do not know . Come on . We 'll get done faster . It 'll be our little secret . You 're good with secrets , aren 't you , Chris ? I got it ! I got Arkham . Arkham ? What are you doing here ? I live here . You wheeze , I 'll shoot you . Ah , Miss parker ? - We 've a little problem here . - Open the file , Broots . Ah , I can 't . The files ' like a doorbell on it - and if I open it , a warning 's going to be sent ... - Then whoever is behind this will know that we 're here . Ding dong . He already does . Do it ! Ah , it 's encrypting . It 's turning into gibberish . Did you see what it said ? Ah , neutralisation , ah , nineteen hundred hours ... Seven PM . That 's the exact time your father is due to land on the Tower helipad . So it 's true . They 're going to murder my father . I have no knowledge of this . You son of a bitch . I 'd say we 're all in the dark on this one , Miss Parker . No computers . No phones . No power . Doors are electronically sealed . Sub-level lock down . Designed to keep the Centre intact during a nuclear event . Or a palace coup against my father . Override the lock down . lmpossible . - If you think I 'm going to sit here like one of your caged lab rats ... - I 'm trapped too , Miss Parker . My oxygen tank is almost empty . Would I do that to myself ? Whoever is trying to kill your father now knows you 're here . And they 'll come for you too . Raines has a point . Now , is it possible that the lock down has something to do with the fire security test ? There is no test you moron . They wanted to clear the Centre . Now I 'm laying odds that Nosferatu has a sniper on the helipad . I don 't believe Raines had anything to do with this . Wake up and smell the oxygen Syd . He 's behind everything . Can you unlock the Arkham files ? Well , I ... I 've got them on disk . It will take a couple of hours , give or take . I 've got less than two and my father 's dead , do you understand ? Easy Parker . Broots is doing the best he can . Could it be that the elevators have a back up power system ? Oh , Hayes . - Who ? - My new sweaper . Ah , I left him voice-mail after I called you two . Now , his orders are to find me in the sim lab if he hasn 't heard from me within the hour . Well , that 's now . We 're in the clear . That 's if he got the message . Parker family motto . Never depend on anyone but yourself . Give me the sim lab . This is Hayes . Hello ? Hello ? I 'm unable to contact the Centre sir . Keep trying . Try it now . Nah . We 've got to push start it . I 'm going to pop the clutch . You give me a good push . Think you 've got it in you ? Yeah , whatever . Ready ? - Jarod ? - My brakes ! Jarod . Jarod . Jarod . Jarod . Jarod . Jarod . The Centre 's original boiler system extends through every sub-level right up to the lobby . Damn ! Tragically ironic that all this is happening on the anniversary of your mother 's suicide . Murder . And don 't talk about her . Please . Help me out of here . I 'll help you out of there . Miss Parker . Are you okay ? Why wouldn 't I be ? I just haven 't seen you in awhile , since ... since what happened to your mother . She killed herself , Jarod . She was sick . What 's his name ? They call him Angelo . Sydney says he 's special , but I can 't get through to him . Maybe I can . Cracker Jack ? You 've never had them ? The snack with a toy surprise . Why would someone want a surprise in their food ? Surprise . You did it ? What about the elevator ? Oh , I 've found some tools . And look . These . Walkie talkies . My father lands in ninety minutes . What about the Arkham file ? It 'll take three hours at least . Sounds like he 's got even less . I 'd better stay with him . His pulse is bad . Alright , if you don 't hear from us in twenty minutes , I want you to forget Mr Clean and get out . You 're my failsafe , Syd , in case we get nailed . Wait . What do you mean nailed ? Back Broots . Stay here . Stop or you 're dead ! Miss Parker . Breathe now . - Who ? Who ? - Sweepers . But I don 't know either one . Come on , Let 's go . Jarod ? Jarod . - What happened ? - You flipped the jeep . - Is that hurt ? - Only when I blink . I gotta get you out of here . I think I broke my leg . Chris , you have to go get help . They 're going to send a search . I mean , when we don 't show up , they 're going to come looking for us . Chris I could be bleeding internally . You have to go get help . Just ... just climb over that cliff . There should be a road . You can do it . I cannot ! I cannot ! Sydney , we 're at the elevator . What ? Oh . It 's a bullet hole . They haven 't fixed that after all these years ? It 's the Centre . They 're always trying to send a message . Chris , you have to go get help . God , Oh , my god . Listen to me ! You have to go get help . No , I can 't . No ! I can 't do that . Yes . You can . This is about your car accident , isn 't it ? It 's about how your best friend died . You listen to me . Accidents happen . People die . - That is no secret . - Why do you keep saying that ? Because I can help you , if you let me . Let me help you . Nick wanted to go for a shortcut that night . He was going too fast . We spun out and we hit a tree and jammed the steering wheel into him . What happened ? And then the cops got there and his car was on fire and I was outside and Nick was still inside . Nick died instantly . You can 't blame yourself for that . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . He didn 't . I let him die . I let him die . You 'll enjoy this . I had one of those ... parental wakeup calls at breakfast , you know , time sure flies . My little Debbie tells me she knows what she wants to do in life . She 's ten . Anyway , she says ... You ever think of getting out of here , Broots ? Excuse me ? The Centre . Leaving . Taking Debbie and just going somewhere ... else . Yeah ! Actually lots of times . Do it . Don 't worry about what other people think . Don 't buy into the false security of staying put . If you think that 's what you need to do , then do it . Do it for Debbie . and do it now because the next elevator you get on ... I ... I never knew your mother , Miss Parker but I bet the choices she made had everything to do with her little girl . So what does Debbie want to do with her life ? She says she wants to be just like you . Here we go . We 're going to the lobby . Wait for me . Love . I 'm getting real sick of you . You should not have searched the mainframe . And where exactly are Broots and Sydney ? I thought Stooges travelled in threes . By the way , fire drills are for pyros and grade schoolers . Can 't blame a girl for trying . If you were at the cemetery , crying your little eyes out like you were supposed to be you wouldn 't be in this tricky little mess , now would you ? Don 't you think it 's time to turn off the faucet . How appropriate for you to die in this elevator . Just like mummy . If there is one place that I 'm not dying , it 's here . Miss Parker , you 've been shot . It 's like a flesh wound . It must have been a ricochet . Yeah , off my arm . - You 're bleeding pretty badly , Miss Parker . - It is nothing . No . Sit down . Where the hell are we ? We are at SL-26 . Yeah , that 's right . Nice shot ! I hear something . Wait ! Wait ! You 're not going out there . Here . I want to kill her , not screw her . Can you think of anything better ? I got your back . Now I feel better . Bet you never thought you 'd get buried with a coward ? Is that what you are , Chris ? Is that what Nick would think of you ? What happened that night ? We were inside of the car . I was upside down when I came to . I looked over , Nick was stuck under the steering wheel . There was blood everywhere . He 's looking over at me . His eyes all scared . They 're begging me to help him . And then the fire started coming in the smoke . I just sat there frozen . I can still see his eyes . What did you do ? I slid out of the car . And I crawled away . Then the flames grew bigger . I could hear his voice calling me from the fire . I should 've burned , Jarod . I should have died . Nick was pinned inside that car . You couldn 't have saved him if you wanted to . Because I ran away . If you had stayed in that car , you would have died . Your response was human . I ran away ! I know what loss is like . I watched my brother die in a car accident . Not a day goes by that I don 't blame myself that I don 't think of something that I could 've done . As time went by he forgave me . I hear his voice inside of me . Just like you hear Nick 's . What would he want you to do now ? Wait , Miss Parker . Careful . Did you hear that sound ? Oh ! I 'm officially in hell . Give me that walkie . Angelo . Broots , how 's the Arkham file coming ? - Two hours . - Great . My father lands in one . You gotta get me back to the lobby , Broots . Tasty . Tasty . Daughter sad . You miss your mother , don 't you ? She used to give me these . It 's just me and my daddy now . But he 's always working . My mum and I used to talk about things . She would brush my hair or we 'd read together . My mum 's gone too . I talk to her though . Her voice is inside of me just like your mother 's is inside of you . Mum . They 're trying to hurt mum . Daddy . Trying to hurt Daddy . Daughter sad . Wait ! What are you ... Don 't touch that . He 's speeding it up . - Golden Hawk down . - What ? There 's no sniper . She 's sabotaged the helicopter . Golden Hawk down . It 's a distance sensitive triggering device . - A what ? - A triggering device . As soon as the helicopter gets within a hundred feet of the tower an explosive device goes off . The helicopter loses control and crashes . But it looks like an accident . Exactly . Toy surprise . I told you I don 't want any ! Ah . Surprise . It is a DSA . And it 's dated the day of my mother 's death . Where is Jarod ? He 's been taken to his space , Mr Parker . What happened to Catherine ? My wife was very sick . Troubled , yes . But suicide ? You 'll never discuss this incident with anyone . Ever . Not with Jarod and especially not with my daughter . Go home , now ! I want you back in this laboratory tomorrow , ready to work . Life goes on , Sydney . Life goes on . Daddy sad . Must save Daddy . Let 's finish this . The boiler hatch should be right over there . Parker , where are you ? We 're at SL-26 heading for the boiler . You 've got to hurry , your father lands in less than thirty minutes . Tell me something I don 't know . Miss Parker ! Up there ! The boiler goes all the way up to the lobby . Let 's hope I 'm not too late . Everything 's in place . Thirty minutes until Centre airspace and the triggering point . You ready ? Yeah I think I am . Jarod . Hurry back . - Maybe I should go with you ? - No , I can move faster alone . Wow . Twenty-six floors in fifteen minutes . Are you sure you 're ok to do this ? - Do you remember the code to the power bunker ? - I 've got it , Broots . Good luck . Yes . Syd , I 'm in the lobby . Hayes is dead . Raines isn 't far behind . I 'm plugging him into the Centre 's oxygen system . Get the power on . - Put the walkie to his ear . - We don 't have time , Parker . Do it ! Are you trying to kill my father ? No . Who is ? The same people who killed your mother . Who ? He 's blacking out ! Miss Parker , you have got five minutes . The Centre 's in sight . It 'll be good to be home . Hello , love ! You don 't give up , do you ? Drop the accent . Nobody 's buying it any more . Fine with me bitch . Too much damn work anyway . That 's the problem with you Parkers . You never finish what you started . You look finished to me . You okay ? Yeah ! Nick would be proud . I know , he told me . Thank you . Son , your dad 's waiting for you . Bye . " Teen Dies in Weekend Accident : A Friendship is Shattered " Sorry for the false alarm but it was for a good cause . But your leg is broken . I eat a lot of ice cream . Calcium . It 's good for you . Bridget will be dealt with . I want you to know . Let 's not talk about that now . God , It 's ... it 's beautiful here . You 've never been back ? Not since the burial . I couldn 't bring myself to face her . From now on , every year we come here , together . There are things I 've wanted to say ... You don 't have to say anything Daddy . It 's just good to have you back . Are you ok ? Life goes on . - Parker . - I 'm glad your father is alright . Thank you , Jarod . You miss her ? Yes . She misses you too . How can you be so sure ?

 Name , please . Uh , Amy Jacobs . Okay , Amy , fill out your address card . May I have the next one in line ? Carl , I need a reload . Hey , Carl . Hey ! I need more film . I haven 't loaded it yet . Why do you even bother coming in if you 're not going to do your job ? Nobody 's going to spoil us . Amy ? Amy ! Mom ! Hurry up with those drinks , Lucy . We 're backing up . What are you doing ? These are regular . They all ordered large . What ... ? What happened ? Nobody 's going to spoil us . Nobody 's going to spoil us . Nobody 's going to spoil us . Nobody ... nobody 's going ... Nobody 's going to spoil us . Nobody 's going to spoil ... Nobody 's going to spoil ... Nobody 's going to spoil us . I 'm looking for the agent in charge . And you are ? Special Agent Mulder . I 'll let him know you 're here . Mrs. Jacobs ? I 'm Fox Mulder . I 'm with the FBI . I 'm sorry about your daughter . It 's her birthday on Tuesday . We 're going to do everything we can to find her . Who could do such a thing ? Who could take somebody who wasn 't theirs ? I know you must be feeling ... I 'm sorry ... but how could you really know how I feel ? It 's blood . Amy had a nosebleed . Her little sister said it happened when the kidnapper put his hand over her mouth . We 're running it anyway . Walt Eubanks , special agent in charge . Fox Mulder . Any leads on a suspect ? A vague description from the sister . Hair and fiber pulled some promising bits , but he didn 't leave any prints , here or in the flower beds out front . What about the neighbors ? Nobody saw anything . Not a car ... nothing . It was someone who knew her ... that much we can figure . He knew right where he was going . No , I bet that he didn 't know her so well , or else he wouldn 't have been so bold . Either way , we 're pretty much chasing our tails until something or someone turns on this . What about this woman at the fast-food restaurant ? You heard about that ? Yeah , that 's why I came down here . Seems like a pretty thin lead . Well , you mind if I talk to her ? Hey , save me the time . Great . Thanks . Mulder . I thought you missed your flight . No , we were delayed in D.C. I tried you on your cell phone ... I forgot it . I left in kind of a hurry . Your message said something about a kidnapping ? Yeah , 15-year-old girl named Amy Jacobs was taken from her bedroom last night , 10 : 00 . Is she here ? No . They haven 't found her . What are we doing here ? A 30-year-old woman named Lucy Householder was admitted here shortly after 10 : 00 . She collapsed at work , suffering from some kind of seizure and what her doctors are calling glossolalia . Incoherent speech . Technically , but whether she knew it or not , she was repeating the exact words spoken by Amy 's abductor at the exact same time 20 miles across town . Well , that 's spooky . That 's my name , isn 't it ? Turns out , Lucy Householder knows a little something about kidnapping herself . When she was eight years old , she was taken from her bedroom while her parents were asleep . She was missing for five years until she escaped and someone found her by the side of a road . Apparently , her abductor had kept her locked in a basement the entire time . They never caught him . Lucy ? I 'm Fox Mulder . This is Dana Scully . We 're with the FBI . We 'd like to ask you a few questions . I 'd like a cigarette . They won 't let me smoke in here . Are you feeling any better ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'd just like a cigarette . A young girl was kidnapped last night . Have you heard anything about that ? What are you asking me for ? Do you remember what you were saying last night when you collapsed at work ? What ? You were saying , " Nobody 's going to spoil us . " Does that mean anything to you ? No . Can you think of any reason why you might have said it ? What did I just say ? You see , those were the exact words spoken by the kidnapper to the little girl when he took her last night . So you can see that under the circumstances , it might seem strange that you ... So what 's your point ? All of us kidnap victims got to stick together ? No . We just want to find the little girl any way we can , and if you know anything ... Look , what I 've been through in my life I wouldn 't want to wish on anybody . Doesn 't mean I can make it any better for me or anyone else . All right . Well , thanks for talking to us , Lucy . Yeah . Hey ! When do I get out of here ? I 'm sure as soon as your doctors feel it 's okay for you to go . No , they say it 's up to you . No . We can 't hold you here . You 're free to go . I guess she 's not too big on confined spaces . Yeah . You the one that called for a tow ? No . Not me . Gary Mosier ? No . Wrong guy . While I 'm out here , might as well give you a hand . Oh , it 's okay . We 'll be fine . Hey , looks like you 're in a world of hurt . Blown sidewall ... you 're going to need a new tire . Yeah , yeah . Looks that way . - Got a spare in the trunk ? - Yeah . 20 bucks cash ... my boss don 't got to know about it . Have you on the road in five minutes . I can 't pay you . Make it ten . Pop the trunk . Take me five minutes max . Leave me alone ! Hey , man , what the hell 's your problem ? Leave me alone ! Get out of here ! Lunatic ! Freak ! Hold on a second . Agent Mulder , Lucy Householder ... you get anywhere on that ? I 'm working on it . Got one of my guys on the line says she 's got a criminal record ... prostitution , narcotics convictions . She 's done some time . It doesn 't surprise me , given her history . She 's also got a boyfriend doing time for assault and child endangerment . Used to live with him up in the hills . Pretty sketchy characters . I don 't think she 's involved . Closest thing I got right now to a lead . I can tell them to shift some men ... No . Let me follow up on that , okay ? Thanks . Mulder , I got something ... something weird . What ? I was going over Lucy Householder 's medical workup and something hit me . Her blood type is O-positive . Yeah ? Forensics lifted two blood types off of her work clothes ... O-positive and B-positive . Two guesses as to what Amy Jacobs ' blood type is . Well , how could it be Amy Jacobs ' blood ? Lucy was all the way across town . I don 't know , Mulder , but it begs the question . Why ? Because it matches the victim 's blood type ? How many people have B-positive blood , Scully ? One in five ? That 's got to be hundreds of thousands of people in the local population alone . We 're not talking about the local population , we 're talking about a woman who 's tied to this case , who had somebody else 's blood on her uniform . Lucy is a victim , Scully , just like Amy Jacobs . If she 's got any connection to this case , that 's the extent of it . Well , we 'll know soon enough . What are you talking about ? I 'm running a PCR on her blood to see - if there 's a DNA match . - Do me a favor . - Will you keep that under your hat ? - Why ? 'Cause I don 't want Lucy Householder treated like a suspect in this case until it 's absolutely certain that she is one , okay ? Lucy ? I 'm cold . I brought you another blanket . We should call the doctor . No ! Let me see your face . What did you do to yourself ? It 's dark . Why is it dark ? I can 't see . You hold on now . I can 't see . Give me your E.T.A. , please . Dispatch , this is 17 . Our E.T.A. is five minutes . Over . How 's she doing ? Fine . Blood pressure 's back to normal . Temperature 's back up . She must have gone down the rabbit hole for a while . You should get something to eat soon . Get your blood sugar back up . Thanks . What do you say , Lucy ? Can I take you to dinner ? You feeling better ? Better than what ? Better than Amy Jacobs ? Wouldn 't know . If anybody knows , I 'd say you do . I 've got my own set of problems now , thank you . How 'd you scratch your face ? Must 've done it in my sleep . Are you using again , Lucy ? I 'm clean . Passed my test last week . You can ask Henry . With flying colors . Have you ever experienced temporary blindness before ? I 've probably experienced just about everything once or twice . It 's all been pretty temporary . That girl 's in trouble , Lucy . And there 's not a damn thing I can do about it . You understand ? I can 't help you . I think you can , Lucy . How ? Well , that 's something you have to tell me . What can I possibly do ? Lead us to her . I don 't know where she is . I don 't care . I 'm not interested . Well , that 's too bad , Lucy , because right now I think you 're her best hope . If I 'm her best hope , then that little girl 's in a hell of a lot more trouble than you think . Who are you ? What do you want ? Why are you doing this ? ! Please . I want to go home . You don 't want to talk to me , Lucy ? You don 't want to come sit by me ? Mulder , I 've got a ... Scully , take a look at this . How about if you just come out into the light ? - Is that Lucy ? - Yeah . Was taken in 1978 , the week she was found . She 'd been held in the dark so long , her eyes were hypersensitive to the light . Whoever held her captive wasn 't very big on conversation , either . She 's 13 years old here and can barely string two words together . It 's amazing she 's gotten anywhere in life . Well , by most yardsticks , she hasn 't , Mulder . Look , I think we 've got a break in the case , a big one . What is it ? School pictures were mailed out this week to everyone in Amy 's class except Amy . One of Eubanks 's men discovered it . Who 's the photographer ? It 's an outfit called Larken Scholastic . Now , the photographer checked out , but his assistant was fired the day after the shoot ... - a man named Carl Wade . - What have you got on him ? DMV 's an old address , but he spent the good part of the past 15 years institutionalized for a bipolar condition . The only thing current we have on him is this photo . It was taken by his employer trying out a new camera . Have you shown this picture to Amy 's little sister ? They 're doing it right now . I 'm going to take it and show it to Lucy . Lucy ? Lucy , wait . No . I 'm done with you . I just want to ask you a question . Lucy , wait a second . Don 't touch me . I don 't like to be touched . I 'm sorry . I was doing okay until this , you know ? Figures . I just want to show you a photograph , okay ? You recognize him , don 't you ? Lucy . Hey ! No ! Ow . Lucy ? What 's happening to me ? He 's probably changed a lot over the last 17 years . Did you even know his name ? Carl Wade . He worked as a photographer 's assistant . School pictures mostly . That 's where he saw Amy Jacobs . So what do you want from me ? I want you to tell me what you 're going through . Might feel good to tell somebody . I feel like it 's happening all over again . You can actually feel what she 's going through , can 't you ? I don 't want to go through this again . Lucy , she needs your help . There 's nothing I can do . Lucy ... Wait here a second , okay ? What 's going on ? We 're here to arrest Lucy Householder . Why ? I think you know why , Agent Mulder . What the hell is happening ? Mulder , the blood on Lucy 's uniform was an exact DNA match . Lucy was covered in Amy Jacobs ' blood . She didn 't do it , Scully . Mulder , it 's incontrovertible evidence . Agent Mulder ! Where is she ? She was just here . Well , she 's gone now . Please . I 'm ... I 'm thirsty . You shouldn 't have run . I was taking care of you . I thought you understood that . Why did you run away ? Please , mister , I need some water . You shouldn 't have run ! Please . I-I 'm so thirsty . I want my mom . I don 't want to die here . Please . Please , mister . Don 't let me die ! You 're going to drive her away with this . She 's been driven away , Agent Mulder . I 'm trying to find her . A half a dozen witnesses placed her across town at the exact time of the kidnapping . I 'm well aware of the facts . Well , then trust me on this , she 's not working with Wade . How 'd she get the blood on her ? She may have bled it . She bled Amy Jacobs ' blood ? Yes , it may explain why there was so little of it on the carpet in Amy 's bedroom . Agent Eubanks , line three . I don 't have time for this nonsense , Agent Mulder . We 've got a young girl 's life at stake . I hate to say this , Mulder , but I think you just ran out of credibility . He 's wrong , Scully . You are protecting her beyond the point of reason . I 'm protecting her because I think she 's connected to Amy Jacobs , just not the way everybody else thinks she is . Did you consider for one minute that the person she 's connected to is Carl Wade ? Carl Wade . Why would she be connected with Carl Wade ? For the same twisted reason that abused children crave their parents ' love or hostages develop sympathy for their captors . I mean , maybe Lucy developed some kind of emotional dependency . After five years in a dark pit , I 'm sure she developed some kind of connection with Wade , just not the kind that you 're suggesting . Well , it makes a lot more sense than the notion that she 's bleeding Amy Jacobs ' blood . I don 't know how to explain it , but I think that Wade 's abduction of Amy triggered some kind of physical response in Lucy ... some kind of empathic transference . - Mulder , you can 't ... - That 's-that 's how I account for what Lucy 's going through . That 's how I account for the identical words that corresponded to Amy and the spontaneous wounds and blood as well . Then why did she run ? If she 's innocent , what was she running from ? Because she 's afraid . You don 't see what you 're doing , do you , Mulder ? You are so close to this that you just don 't see it . What don 't I see ? The extreme rationalization that 's going on . Your personal identification with the victim , or in this case , the suspect . You 're becoming some kind of an empath yourself , Mulder . You are so sympathetic to Lucy as a victim , like your sister , that you can 't see her as a person who 's capable of committing this crime . You don 't think I 've thought of that ? I have . And not everything I do and say and think and feel goes back to my sister . You of all people should realize that sometimes motivations for behavior can be more complex and mysterious than tracing them back to one single childhood experience . Agent Mulder . We 've got a man on the way in who spotted Wade . Yeah , that 's the guy . I offered to fix his flat . Tried to do the guy a favor , and he went wacko on me . Started freaking the minute I got out of my truck . What about the girl ? Was she with him ? I didn 't see anyone else . Guess she could have been in the trunk . Can you give us an exact spot ? Yeah . Right in the middle of nowhere . Which way was the car headed ? West . Okay , Interstate 12 ... County 15 north ... 903 ... Look at this . Right off the 903 . Easton ? That 's where Lucy was found 17 years ago . It 's a small town , Scully . Somebody 's bound to know Wade 's face , know where he lives . But we already stick out like a sore thumb , Mulder . If we start canvassing Main Street , somebody 's going to pick up the phone to him . But he 's a photographer , right ? Yeah . He should have an account here . Amy ? Mulder ! Yeah . What 's happening ? Did you find her ? Where are they , Lucy ? Tell us where Wade took Amy . I don 't know . Anything happens to that girl , Lucy , and you 'll be tried as an accomplice . Were they here when you arrived ? No . You haven 't seen them ? You haven 't spoken with them ? I said no . Then why are you here ? I don 't know . Just showed up for no reason in particular ? That 's what you ask us to believe ? I 've been here before . A long time ago . That was where he kept me . So why are you here now ? Take her outside and place her in custody . No . I 'll take her . Come on , Lucy . Agent Mulder ... It 's all right . He hasn 't touched her . Not yet . He wants to , but he can 't . That 's why he takes the pictures . What else , Lucy ? Tell me what else . If he can 't have her all to himself , that 's when he 's dangerous . That 's when he 'll start hurting her . Lucy , you came here to help her . No . Why else would you come back here if not for Amy ? You 're sharing her pain . I can 't ... You 're the survivor . You 're the strong one . Now , Amy needs some of your strength . She 's not going to make it . She has to make it , and you have to help her . She 's cold . She 's cold and-and wet . Lucy , Lucy . Sit down . Sit down . Mulder . They found Wade 's car north of here . - They 're in the water . - What ? There 's a river near here ; I think that 's where they are . But the river 's east , and they found Wade 's car a mile north . Well , wade lives here . He knows these woods . He could be doubling back . Did she tell you that ? No , but I think that 's what she 's trying to do . Mulder , wait ! Stay with her , and get word to Eubanks that Wade may be heading towards the river . Please ! Stop ! I can 't ! Come on ! They 're coming ! I can 't ! Please ! Nobody ... Nobody 's going to spoil us . No ! Can you sit up ? Can you breathe ? Are you able to breathe ? This is Agent Kreski . I 've got what looks like an emergency medical situation . Requesting EMS . Over . Wade ! Federal officer ! Hold it right there ! She 's not breathing . No pulse either . One , two , three , four ... Come on , Amy , breathe . Two , three , four , five ... There 's nothing . Mulder , it 's no good . I 'm sorry . Damn it , Amy , come on ! Stop . You can 't help her . Mulder , it 's no use . Mulder , stop it . Stop it . Mulder , stop ! Mulder . She 's breathing . Have you got her ? ! Is that her ? ! Yeah , we got her ! We have to get an EMS unit here right away with some heat and some oxygen . They 're close . We 've got them up at Wade 's place right now . They 're working on Lucy Householder . I 'm cold . I want to go home . It 's getting dark . We have to get her off the river . I don 't know what happened . She just started coughing , then she couldn 't breathe . By the time the EMS guys got here , she was already gone . How 's Amy ? She 's exhausted , but it looks like she 's going to be fine . The doctors want to keep her for a day or two just to be sure . How serious were her injuries ? Wade must have left her alone . There were no injuries . He must have dragged her through the woods for at least a mile . I know , Mulder . I can 't explain it . She didn 't have a cut on her , and nobody wants to talk about that right now . Everyone 's just relieved to have her back again ... to have her safe . Did they finish up on Lucy ? Yes . They , uh ... they brought in the state pathologist last night , so I stopped by to get the autopsy reports on my way . She drowned , didn 't she ? They found five liters of water in her lungs . She saved Amy 's life . Mulder whatever there was between them , you were part of that connection . Did you think about that ? Lucy may have died for Amy , but without you , they never would have found her . I think she died for more than Amy . What do you mean ? I think , finally , it was ... the only way she could escape . The only way she could forget what happened 17 years ago . Finally , the only way she could outrun Carl Wade . I made this !

 ( lively background chatter ) CHUCK : You don 't need me to tell you again , it 's a dog-eat-dog world out there these days . Winning 's what it 's about . Stay sharp and never , ever look weak . For every hotshot on the way up , there 's another one coming down . And the landing is never pretty . Alan ... We always knew this day was coming . Ever since the dragon lady took over . Here , want this ? Stockbroker of the Year , 1982 . ( plaque clatters in trash can ) Alan , here , come on . You may want this someday . What am I gonna tell Caroline ? What am I going on about ? The world 's always looking for a 55-year-old stockbroker , right ? Look at them . Sharks . ALAN : Thanks for all your support , fellas ! Take it easy , pal . Hey , is there anything I can do ? Yeah . Watch your back . ( water running ) ( snoring ) ( cat meowing ) ( paper thuds against door ) " Stockbroker in coma ... " That 's my old boss . Fred . ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * This is not me . Hey , Gare ! Remember that photo shoot I did yesterday for the magazine Eating Out In Chicago ? GARY : Yeah . Well , it didn 't go too well . Major publicity for us , pal , and it is a disaster . Forget about that . Forget about that ? I look like something out of One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest . Look at that . Look at this . " Mr. Frederick Meanwell , a veteran broker with the firm of Strauss and Associates , went into cardiac arrest shortly after the plastic surgeon , Dr. Swenson , had made the first incision . " Clear ! Clear ! " A spokesman for the hospital said that Mr. Meanwell remains in critical condition . " I feel sick . Yeah . The man is like a father to me . Both of us . Plastic surgery ? Fred ? I mean , he 's not the greatest looking guy , but still , he 's never been that vain . Well , I guess I 'll just have to go talk to him . Yeah , and what are you gonna say to him ? I don 't know . Fred ! Gary ! Hey ! How you doing ? Good , doing good . Hey , what a coincidence , walking into you here . Hey , you 're looking good , huh ? Oh , couldn 't be better . Yeah , good . I haven 't seen you in a couple of months . How are things ? Well , I sold the house . I got a nice condo on the lake now . Hey , what about you , kid ? Huh ? I hear that you and Chuck are starting a new restaurant . Oh , yeah ... Still chasing those rainbows , huh ? It 's , uh , I haven 't found the pot of gold yet , but I 'm still chasing . Nah , you keep looking . Listen , listen to me . I am so proud of you , boy . I mean , you did it . You actually got out . Yeah , I-I guess I did . Well , how about you ? Me ? What ? You talked about teaching high school math . Whatever became of that ? Hey , you know , I still got a daughter in her second year of law school to support . Meanwhile , I 'm still paying her tuition , plus , I 've got alimony , you know . I 've chased all my rainbows . What 's that mean ? Ah , nothing . Look , kid , I gotta run . Hey , listen , it 's good seeing you again , okay ? It 's been too long . Give me a call , will ya ? Yeah . Call me , I mean it . Fred , Fred ! Yeah ? I understand you 're having surgery . Where 'd you hear that ? Uh , well , Chuck was at his plastic surgeon 's , and he saw your name on a chart . What 's wrong with Chuck ? Well , his football , old football injury . Oh ... I told him , I said , you know , look , beauty 's on the inside . What do you need this for ? Chuck doesn 't listen . So , what are you having done , Fred ? Well , ( chuckles ) , uh ... you know , things have changed down at the office . Sandy Comess was promoted to manager , and she 's become the high priestess of the youth culture now . Sandy ? Yeah , Sandy Comess . Yeah , she canned Alan Newton yesterday , and by the way she looks at me , I 'm next . I mean , hell , you know , image is everything , and I 'm competing with these young stockbrokers and their high-tech stocks . I 'm just gonna try to level the playing field , that 's all . Hey , keep this to yourself . Now , listen ... are you sure you want to do something like this ? I mean , uh ... Why not ? Well , surgery , it 's , it 's a very risky business . It 's very risky . And , uh , do you even know the surgeon ? Gary , he 's one of the best . Okay ? Look , I gotta go . I 've got a big appointment , I can 't be late , okay ? You call me , all right ? Say-say hello to Chuck for me . Yeah , I 'll do that . ( overlapping chatter , phones ringing ) Sandy . Gary , it 's been a while . Yes , it has . If you 're looking for a position , I 'm afraid we 're overstaffed as it is . No , I 'm not . Actually , I 'm here to talk to you about Fred Meanwell . You know , Fred 's a good friend of mine , Sandy . Oh , yes , I do . What about him ? Well , Fred 's got this , uh , crazy idea that you 're thinking about letting him go . This is a company matter , Gary . You know , Sandy , when I came here beforeyou , I was told two things : One , that the , uh , the market was a jungle , and two , that you need a pretty damn good guide to get through that jungle . And I gotta tell you something : Fred Meanwell 's one of the best damn guides I ever knew , Sandy . Well , the jungle 's changed , Gary . There 's a lot of new , young lions out there . Ernie , what 's the six-month LIBOR ? 7.65 percent . .12 up from yesterday . Case in point . Fred doesn 't even know what LIBOR is . Hey , Sandy , how old are you ? What 's that got to do with Fred ? Well , I would hope it has nothing to do with Fred . Just as I would hope it would have nothing to do with you someday . Oh , look , Gary , what 's keeping Fred here is one very big client , Harry Knighton . That 's it . Fred 's with him now . He 's got some hot tip about the Hartfeld Corporation . Wants Knighton to invest big . As far as I 'm concerned , he blows this , well , it 's not personal . But you know the game , Gary . ( door closes ) Fred ! Come on in . Thanks , Harry . It 's good to see you again . You , too . How are you ? Great . Have a seat . Thank you . Joanne tells me that , uh , you 've got a tip on Hartfeld Corporation . Well , your , uh , your pretty assistant is absolutely right . I thought old man Hartfeld was still in the hospital . Until this morning . Now , my sources tell me that he got up out of the wheelchair and walked out a back entrance under his own steam . Now , they 're gonna try to keep this from the press for a couple of days . You and your sources , Fred . Yeah , I know , that 's what we pay the man for , Joanne . But , uh , I 'm still a little bit shaky here , Fred . Hartfeld Corporation is totally dependent on Garson Hartfeld . Now , if he 's able to run things again , great . We 're gonna make a killing . But if he steps down again ... My sources tell me that he looks healthier than he has looked in years . I 'm in . Buy me 180,000 . Mr. Knighton , I think that ... Joanne , we 're gonna load the boat . I 'm betting on Fred . Oh , Harry , uh , we should make this individual equities , 'cause you 're gonna be paying a load , but at least you 'll have a pillow under your downside . See what I 'm talking about ? Experience . Excuse me . Uh , Dr. Swenson ? Yes ? My name is Gary Hobson . I wonder if I could speak to you a minute . What can I do for you ? Fred Meanwell , he 's a very dear friend of mine , and he 's coming in for surgery today and I ... well , I 'm concerned . Well , how 's that ? Fred 's in a slump right now , and I have a feeling this surgery is unnecessary . That 's his choice , Mr. Hobson . Well , no , no , I ... I understand that . I-It 's just that he hasn 't been himself lately . He 's , uh , kind of depressed , and you did give him a thorough checkup , didn 't you ? Something that 's generally recommended before surgery . Well , I , I think that , uh , I don 't want Fred to rush into anything here , and I think that if , if you and I spoke to him , maybe we could get him to put it off a day or two . Fred has already made his decision . I can 't discuss his case with you . Well , yes , I ... Is there anything else ? Well , I ... I have patients to see . No . Ooh . Okay , one more . Here we go . Very good ... good . Oh , wait a minute , wait a minute . One second , Cindy . Okay , get ready to smile . ( camera snapping ) A little less smile . Move your head to the left . Excellent . ( camera snapping ) Okay . Good . ( camera snapping ) You know , it 's so good to have a real professional . Not that the other guy wasn 't a professional . He just didn 't have your , um ... your , um ... Portfolio ? Your , uh ... your vibe . GARY : Chuck , you in there ? No . Come on . Gare , you 're in my light , please . Huh ? Listen ... Oh , take one of the two of us . Listen , I think I know why ... Gare , did you meet Cindy ? No , I didn 't- - hello , Cindy . Cindy , Gary ; Gary , Cindy . Hello , Cindy . Hi , Gary . Listen , I think I know why Fred ... why he 's having the surgery . It 's because he 's gonna ... thinks ... well , he thinks he 's going to lose his job , so we got to save his job . Okay , that 's right . I 'm a little busy right now taking these pictures . Would you , uh , listen to me , would you ? Look . Harry Knighton , Fred 's client ... he 's big in the Hartfeld Corporation . Yeah , well , Hartfeld 's about to croak- - I wouldn 't invest . No , no , you don 't understand . This is a solution right here . So , it ... Marissa , you ready ? All set . Everything here to keep him busy . Come on , let 's go . And do what ? Look , I 'll explain along the way . Please , just let 's go- - come on . How do we get out of here ? All right , uh ... Cindy , you 're going to get me those proof sheets ? You got it- - pronto . And , uh , maybe next time , I 'll , uh ... I 'll take your picture , huh ? Whoa . Where did you get all this stuff ? My Great-Aunt May . You know , she never throws anything away . Oh , well , that must run in the family . Hey , I think , uh ... I think that photographer has a thing for me . It 's too bad you couldn 't see her , Marissa . Oh ... she 's really hot , huh ? Mm-hmm . Come on , let 's take your car . Oh , there 's a little problem with the car . Parking tickets- - I got the Denver boot . We got to take a taxi . Uh , wait a second . We 're not going to get a taxi at this hour . Just leave it to an expert . You 're not going to find a taxi at this ... Taxi ! Stop ! ( tires screeching ) Come on . Let 's go . ( door opening ) Just got to know how to speak their language . Right , Chooch ? MALE TAXI DRIVER : You got it , Guido . Okay . FRED : Mr. Benzinger , I realize you 're a very busy man , but if you could give me ten minutes of your time , then I could explain to you the opportunities of mortgage bonds . I think you 'd be very interested . Uh , could you hold on , Mr. Benzinger ? Hey , Marissa . Hey , Fred , how you keeping ? I miss your smile at the reception desk . I miss your voice . So , what 's uh ... what 's with the box ? It 's an inheritance from my Great-Aunt May . She passed away last week . Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . Yeah . Well , the good news is , um , she left me all this . Uh , just one second . FRED : Hey , Mr. Benzinger , can I call you right back ? Thank you . Well , that 's , uh ... that was very generous of her , Marissa . You know me , Fred . Uh , investing is not my strong point . And Gary said that there was no one better to help me sort through all this than you . Ah , well ... what ... what exactly is ... is in the box ? I know what you 're thinking . Chump change . Don 't be fooled . My Aunt May may have lived like a pack rat , but she was very sly when it came to money . I ... I could be sitting on a gold mine . I really appreciate this , Fred . Oh . Yeah ... no problem . No problem at all . Why don 't we , uh , use the conference room ? Okay . You want to just take my arm ? Yeah , following you . Ah , that old familiar smell : fear , sweat and Big Macs . You believe we used to live like this ? Oh , listen , I don 't even want to think about it . Another hour in this place , and they 'll be dragging the river for my body . Bingo . Just give me five minutes . Go ... go , go , go , go . Ms. Comess ? What an enchanting ensemble . Has anyone ever told you you have an incredible flair for fashion ? Fishman . Weren 't you recently fired from this establishment ? Uh , no . I believe " tendered my resignation " is the operative phrase . I decided to pay a little social visit , and you were on the top of the list . Is this a bad time ? MARISSA : Obviously , you want to invest for the long term , so ... should I be thinking growth or dividend income ? Uh , well , uh , that , uh , all depends on the amount . KROELL : Hey , Gare . If you 're looking for Fred , he 's in the conference room . Fred ? No , no , no . I ... I was just ... just reminiscing . Oh . CHUCK : Here 's the deal . I am now part owner and full-time manager of one of the hottest restaurants in Chicago , and we are talking about expanding . ( chuckling ) : Oh , please . This has the word , " franchise , " written all over it . ( typing ) Now , we 're thinking of starting an initial stock option at five dollars a share . ( beeping ) Ernie , did you call Ms. Miller about ... Mrs. Comess . Fishman . You 're missing the big picture here , Ms. Comess . The big tableau . ( typing ) Oh , what are we up to so far ? $ 312 in cash , a , uh , modest coin collection and , uh , 16 postage stamps . ( beep ) ( beep ) ( beeping ) Ma 'am ... big trade , crazy . I don 't understand it . Elucidate . According to the board , we just dumped Mr. Knighton 's entire holding in Hartfeld Corp. What ? 180,000 shares , gone . Wait , wait . Fred just put through the order to buy them . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . Oh , my God . I would forget about the S and P 500 for now and think more in terms of getting you a CD . COMESS : Meanwell , my office now . ( snaps fingers ) Uh ... uh , excuse me , Marissa . Thanks , Fred . You , out . Think about what I said , huh ? You just sold all Hartfeld stock . I ... I , uh ... I did what ? I want an explanation , and I want it now . An explanation for what ? How could you sell those shares ? Are you completely out of your mind ? Harry Knighton on the horn for you , Meanwell . Line two . Put him on speaker . We should all hear this . ( switch clicks ) Go ahead , Mr. Knighton . KNIGHTON ( over speaker ) : Fred , are you there ? Uh ... oh , I 'm here . I 'm right here , Harry . I 'm not happy , Fred . In fact , you could say I 'm about to go thermonuclear . You said the man was healthy ; and the next thing I hear , his ticker explodes ! What ? We got to dump that stock , Fred . It 's going to fall like a stone . Fred , are you there ? ! ( mouthing ) I ... I sold the stock , Harry . All of it ? All ... the whole thing , all of it . ( sighs ) How did you know ? Sources , Harry . You know , you never underestimate the value of sources . You ... you mean we 're okay ? We didn 't lose anything ? Well , as a matter of fact ... ( typing ) ( computer beeps ) you are ... 20 grand to the good . Uh , it 's not much , I 'm afraid , but , you know , it 's ... ( laughing ) : Fred . I ... oh , I love you , Fred ! ( laughing ) Well , I 'm very fond of you , too , Harry . Excuse me while I crawl back from the ledge here . I 'll , uh ... I 'll talk to you later . Good-bye , Harry . Sources ? Each to his own , Ms. Comess . Or ... or shall I call you Sandra ? You can call me whatever you want . How about over lunch ? I 'd like to learn more about the Meanwell method . I 'd be delighted , but I 'm afraid it will have to wait . I have an appointment . If you 'll excuse me . And don 't forget , I 'm on vacation . Well , another hard day 's work at the office , huh ? Memories , buddy . Get a cab . Watch out , watch out . Taxi ! Hey , hey ! That 's pathetic . Wait here . Out of my way , pal . Whoa ! ( tires screeching ) Okay . See ? No problemo . ( Chuck sighs ) No . I thought you were supposed to be good . I 'm an artist , Chuck ... not a surgeon . An artist ? Who do you think you are , Salvador Dalí ? These are surreal . Hey , if the shoe fits . What is that supposed to mean ? I 'm out of here . You 'll get my bill . It 's been fun . Sort of . You expect me to pay for these ? Unbelievable . What ? Nothing . I know my face , Gare . These don 't look anything like me . Is that too much to ask ? Some passing resemblance ? There 's got to be a decent photographer in this town . Maybe you should go to a different city . Chuck , come here , look at this . Fred 's not going to go into a coma anymore . That 's great . No , it 's not . Look . " Stockbroker dies while undergoing plastic surgery . " It 's got to be a mistake . A mistake ? Yeah , it 's got to be stuck or something . What do you mean , stuck ? The paper- - it happens . Yeah ... a piece of grit gets stuck into the , uh , cosmic machinery and makes the whole thing just stop . What are you talking about ? What else could it be ? I mean , we saved the guy 's job , right ? Heck , he 's practically a hero down there now . So , if what you say is right , the only reason he was getting plastic surgery was so that he could keep his job . Well , now that his job is safe , there 's no reason for him to even get plastic surgery , so the thing 's got to be wrong . Unless I could be wrong . Right ? Whatever the reason is , we got to figure it out . Right . JOANNE : Fred ? Hey . Hi . How are you , sweetie ? Good . Mm . Hello , my little genius . I cannot believe what you did this morning . Lucky , huh ? Luck had nothing to do with it . You are the smartest , most wonderful man in the entire world . ( laughing ) : Yes . Whatever you say . GARY : Fred ! Gary , what are you ... ? What a coincidence . Meeting you three times in one day , huh ? Really . Oh , uh , Gary Hobson , this is Joanne Hanson . Hi . Oh , nice to meet you . Gary 's a friend of mine . Nice to meet you . Fred 's very proud of your success . We 're gonna have to come by and see your restaurant sometime . Oh , please do , any time . Any time at all . I got to get back to work . Okay , darling . Bye . See you later . Nice to meet you . GARY : Nice to meet you . Nice lady . Yeah , yeah . She works , uh ... works for Harry Knighton . We 've been seeing each other for a few months . Oh , listen , Fred , I want to talk to you about something . Hey , look , I want to thank you for this morning . Oh . How the hell did you do that ? ! Well , it 's just , uh , sources . You always taught me , never underestimate a source . Oh , yeah , yeah . Well , anyway , you-you sure saved my bacon . Well , that-that 's good . Now , listen , Fred , you won 't be needing that , uh , surgery . Gary , did you get a good look at Joanne ? Yeah . She 's a good-looking ... She 's 33 , and I 'm fifty . How long do you think a great girl like that is gonna stay with me , huh ? I don 't know . Sometimes when I 'm with her , age doesn 't matter at all . You know ? And then I look in the mirror ... Fred , have you told her about the surgery yet ? No , no . She thinks I 'm gonna be out of town for a few weeks . Well , Fred , maybe you ought to tell her . Oh , yeah , sure . Let her see how desperate I am . Maybe she doesn 't want you to change . I mean , maybe , she ... Gary , you can 't believe what they say to you just to make you feel good . Anyway , I 've heard that song before . Yeah , I know . I 've been divorced before , too , remember ? But I got ... Yeah , I know , but she didn 't dump you for some 28-year-old golf pro , you know ? I mean , she didn 't ... Buddy . Wise up , Gary . It all turns out to be the things you don 't want it to be . Money , power , looks . Come on , Fred , you don 't believe that . I mean ... Gary , Gary , look , take care of yourself , okay ? You 're , you 're acting a little strange , all right ? Well ... No , no , no . No . Starting a restaurant is very stressful , you know ? So , get some rest or take some time off ? Well , Fred , maybe you ought to ... I 'll give you a call , okay ? In a month , I 'll give you a call . But listen , Fred ... Good-bye , Gary . Fred , there 's something I want to tell you now . I ... Good-bye , Gary . Bye-bye . ( whispering ) : All right , now , listen , I got to find the operating schedule , the exact time , and the hospital we 're doing this in . ( bell dings ) What are you doing ? ( whispers ) : Look , go check his office . How am I gonna do that ? I 'll distract whoever while you go , sneak in and find the schedule . That 's the stupidest ... Hi . May I help you ? Hi . My name is Fred Fishburg , and I need to see the doctor . And may I ask what this is regarding ? Yeah ... Excuse me . WOMAN : Mm-hmm . Uh , can I use your bathroom ? Oh , first door on your right . Anyway , uh , it 's kind of a , uh , personal matter , but , uh , ( whispers ) : it 's my face . ( whispers ) : What about it ? Well , I just did a , uh , photo shoot for a very exclusive men 's magazine , and I noticed that from certain angles , I don 't look as handsome as I do in real life . ( door closes ) Sarah . Afternoon , Doctor . Doctor , hi . My name is Frank Fishburger , and I 'm a new patient . SWENSON : Oh , that 's nice . I 'll be right with you . You come very highly recommended . Well , that 's good . You know , by my acquaintances , my friends , my ... My mother saw you on Jenny Jones . Uh , Mr. Goldfish , I have a very busy day today . My assistant will be very happy to give you an appointment . Security . What are you doing here ? I-I don 't know how to put this , 'cause we 're running out of time , but Fred Meanwell 's life 's in danger . What the hell are you talking about ? Heart . Man has a bad ticker . I tried to stop them , Doctor . CHUCK : You cut on Fred , your insurance premiums are gonna go through the roof . You can 't operate on the guy . CHUCK : We 're talking malpractice city . I gave Mr. Meanwell a very thorough physical . There 's no evidence of any pathology of any kind . Check him again . Check him . Call security . I did . GARY : Look , maybe you missed something on his physical . He may sound crazy , but look at his face- - all-American , sincere , earnest , honest . Get them out of here , both of them . Come on , let 's go ... Does he look crazy to you ? Do I ? Come on , let 's go . I 'm telling you , you can 't operate on this guy . CHUCK : If the papers get wind of this , this is not gonna be good for our business . You happy now ? Come on . Come on , let 's go . Come on . No problem . No problem . Come on , move it . Did you find out where and when ? Yeah . We 've only got a couple of hours to convince him . Come on , we got the light . Let 's go . ( phone ringing , indistinct chatter ) He 's here . ( phone ringing , indistinct chatter ) ( computer keys clicking ) SANDY : Went on vacation . Back in three weeks . Look , I really wanted to talk to Fred , but we can 't reach him anywhere . Maybe you could help . How 's that ? I still can 't figure out how Fred knew about Hartfeld dying . I mean , he sold the stock minutes before the announcement . Well , Fred 's got good instincts . Kroell says he saw you hanging around Fred 's desk right before the news came out , and then you slipped away . Well , that 's because I was waiting for Chuck to finish talking to you , and I ... You 're-you 're ... You 're not ... You 're not ... You 're not thinking that I was involved in any insider trading or anything ? No , no . I just want to know how you guys did it . Maybe we could work together on this . I 'm retired . You 're kidding ? No . He told me he was going to a Bavarian health spa . ( scoffs ) Why would he lie to me ? Well , I-I ... I think maybe he 's just , you know , a little embarrassed . Listen , I love Fred , but he 's not the most secure guy in the world . Well , it 's not because of anything I said . I mean , I never ... Oh , no , no . I 'm not making any accusations . Believe me , I ... I just don 't want Fred to make a mistake is all . Well , what would you like me to do ? Well , I wondered if you could speak with him . And say what ? Well , reassure him . I-I think if you and I- - well , the both of us- - we talked to him , then we can talk him out of the whole crazy idea . I 'm not all that sure it 's so crazy . Excuse me ? Fred is an adult . He doesn 't need you or I to make decisions for him . Yes , but I don 't think this is a decision that he needs to be making , believe me . Have you ever actually known anyone who 's had cosmetic surgery ? Well , no , I haven 't , but I ... All right , look , he 's a grown man , okay ? He doesn 't need you or I to go around policing him . If you love somebody , you need to let them be free to make their own decisions . Oh , well , that 's great , but I don 't think Fred 's ... I got to go work on this . Oh , will-will you talk to him ? No . I don 't think so . Wait . Oh ... What if I told you that if he goes through with this operation , it could put his life on the line ? How do you know ? Well , I-I know , because I ... I can 't tell you how I know , but I-I ... I know ... Oh , okay , look , Mr. Hobson , Gary , I know you mean well , all right ? But I happen to know Dr. Swenson 's reputation , and I know that he would not put Fred in any danger whatsoever , all right ? Yeah , well , that 's great , but ... I 'm really sorry . I have to go . I can 't help you . Excuse me . ( brakes squeaking ) ( indistinct chatter ) Well , I see why you didn 't want to talk to him . What ? Well , it looks like you found someone else to talk to . Gary , I ... Look , you 're gonna tell him the truth , you 're gonna cut him loose , all right ? David . Mom . You know , all you people- - you 're all the same . Yeah , it 's all a big game to you , isn 't it , Mom ? Mom ? JOANNE : Gary , this is my son , David . Hi . Your son ? Yeah . Yeah . David , could you get us a couple of lattes ? Okay . Thanks . He 's just staying with me a couple of days . He 's , uh ... Why don 't you sit down before you fall down ? David just started medical school . Northwestern . You 're married ? No . I was married 22 years ago . I 'm divorced . And Fred knows this ? No . I haven 't been able to tell him . Why not ? ( laughs ) Well , he thinks I 'm 33 . Excuse me ? I 'm 42 years old , Gary . Cosmetic surgery . Oh . After my marriage , when guys would find out I had a kid , they would just run away . Then I turned 40 , and I really panicked . I didn 't really know what to do . I mean , I didn 't want to be alone . So I did it . And I haven 't quite been able to tell Fred . Listen to me . Fred 's not doing this for himself . Fred 's doing this out of vanity . And you got to stop him , 'cause in 40 minutes , he 's gonna go into surgery , and you got to be there before he does . He 'll hate me . Fred 's a good , honest man . They don 't make ' em like Fred anymore . When he talks about you , his whole face lights up . Ever since I 've known Fred , he 's been like a father to me , and I don 't want to see anything terrible happen to him . And if you can get there before he goes into surgery , I promise you , it 'll be like you 're saving his life . What have you got to lose ? DAVID : Mom , you have the , uh , nonfat decaf latte , right ? We 're leaving . What ? We 're leaving . CHUCK : All right , all right , how about this ? You call the doctor 's office . You tell them that Fred has had a change of heart and that he 's not coming . And then Fred shows up . All right , better idea , better idea . Call him , tell him that Michael Jordan is looking for a forth at a golf game at the Lake Hills Country Club . No , because if he 's a sports fan ... I mean , everybody knows the Bulls are not in town . All right , all right . How about this ? ( phone ringing ) McGinty 's . Chuck , Joanne 's going to help . Great . Yeah , listen , you 're closer to the hospital . We 're not going to make it on time , so I want you to keep him off the table , all right ? I 'll keep him on ice until you get there . Bye . Uh ... Everything looks great , Fred . See you about 20 minutes . I 'll be right here . Thanks . CHUCK ( British accent ) : Afternoon , Doctor . ( clears throat ) Well , Mr. Meanwell , how are you feeling today , old chap ? Well , you know ... Top notch , by the looks of things . You look absolutely fabulous . Let 's see what we 've got on the menu today . Now , let 's see here . We 've got a ... upper blasphomasoly , lower blasphomasoly- - splendid . Well , we 're going to be cutting you from the nape of your neck to the bottom of your bollocks . Just kidding , sir . Okay , let 's not keep the saw box waiting . Now , I don 't know about whether you know the procedures , but the first thing that we 're going to be doing ... Whoa ... oh , sorry about that . Wait a minute- - Hold on , hold on . Sorry , sorry . Hang on . Okey-dokey . Now , I 'll tell you , Here- - all right . the nurse usually does these kinds of things , but she 's ... ( tires screeching ) FEMALE OPERATOR ( over phone ) : I 'm sorry , sir- - I can 't connect you to that room right now . They won 't put me through to Fred 's room . Absolutely old fruit . You just lie back and make yourself comfy , okay ? MAN : Whoa . Hold on there , chief . That patient is pre-op . Right . The OR is that way . Indeed it is . Good fellow . Well spotted . We 're under the strictest orders to keep our junior chappies on their toes , don 't you know ? What 's your name , sir ? Jimmy . Jimmy , I 'll be sure you 're sent up to Obstetrics right away . Uh , to the right . Right . Right it is . Jimmy , you 're impressing me more and more every ... GARY : Hey , can you pick it up ? We 're running out of time here . Mr. Meanwell , how you doing ? Oh , okay . Those drugs kicking in yet ? Oh , yeah . Oh , that 's good . Okay , well , I 'm going to put you out in a minute . Okay . All right . Excuse me , uh ... Doctor ... Harper . And you are ? I 'm Dr. Livingston . Listen , I just got back down from Obstetrics . Oh , man , what a scene . There was a lady there screaming , bellowing for her epidermal . I offered to administer it , but she refused . Wouldn 't let me lay a finger on her . She insists that you stick her . Me ? Are you sure ? Yeah , didn 't you get the page ? No . Oh , those numskulls . I 'll tell you what . Uh , you go down there now , and I 'll , uh ... I 'll hold down the fort over here , okay ? Uh ... what did you say your name was again ? Uh , Livingston . The " G " is silent- - but you got to hurry up . She 's going to rip those poor ob-gyns ' heads off . Fine . I 'll just mosey on up . Excellent . Okay . HARPER : Silvia ... have you ever seen that guy before ? No . Okay ... stay calm . Don 't let him too close to the patient . I 'll be right back . Okay . ( tires squealing ) Uh , you sure these are the largest ? I have massive hands . Oh . Clumsy me . Dr. Livingston , I presume ? Yes , that 's my name . Yeah , let 's see some ID , then . ID ? Well , I ... Come on . Fred ! Fred , don 't let them do it ! Fred , they 're going to kill you ! You 've got to wake up , Fred ! Your face looks great , Fred ! Some friends you got . Huh ? What ? You sure you want to proceed ? What ? Oh , yeah . ( sighs ) Yeah , yeah . Let 's go for it , huh ? I swear , it 's not what it looks like . I 'm actually trying to save a life here . Sure you are , Doctor . ( indistinct shouting ) Come on , he 's in OR three . It 's down this way . HARPER : Okay , I 'm going to inject the anesthetic into your IV . You 'll feel a slight burning sensation , and then you 'll be out . See you on the other side , Fred . Stop . Oh , not again . JOANNE : Fred . Joanne ? Joanne ? Wh ... Dr. Swenson . Well ... you ... you two know each other ? Yeah . Dr. Swenson operated on me a couple years ago . I had a face-lift . Eyes , everything . What ? I 'm not 33 , Fred . I 'm ... I 'm 42 . And see that guy over there ? That 's my son , David . Your son ? Yeah . GARY : Hey , uh ... why don 't ... why don 't you give them some room ? Give them a ... oh , come on , give them a little air just so they can talk and what have you . Let 's give them a few minutes . Why , Joanne ? Why didn 't you tell me all this before ? Well , I was going to . I just , um ... I was afraid that I might lose you . GARY : Well , it 's ... it 's not like you 've been totally honest with her , Fred . I mean , you ... Not that it 's any of my business or anything . I just ... Your son ? Look , if you 're going to hate me for this , I understand , but I ... I really don 't think that you should go through with this surgery , and ... and if it is dangerous , I don 't want you to do it . I love you , just like you are . Gary ? You want to make yourself useful ? Get that doctor back in here . Okay , Fred . GARY : Hey , Doc , uh , Fred would like to see you . SWENSON : What did you decide , Fred ? Jim , uh ... you 're going to kill me for this . No problem . It happens . Gary , you happy now ? Yeah . SWENSON : Folks . This appears to be a wrap . Let 's get Mr. Meanwell back to his room and get this OR scrubbed down . Okay . ( sighs ) Bye , Jim . Here you go . NURSE : All right , right behind you . Doctor , looks like we had a little problem here . Oh , my God . It 's dopamine . His IV wasn 't attached ? Thank God we didn 't operate . His blood pressure would have dived right through the floor . SILVIA : Oh , my God . SWENSON : He never would have survived . So , what do you think ? CHUCK : Oh , wonderful . It 's just wonderful . Well , I ... I think it captures the real you . At least , it did when I bailed you out . I look insane . Plus , I have repetitive whiplash injury from being thrown out of two medical buildings in the same day . Well , you got your picture in the paper , though . Oh , yeah , and all my friends and family are going to see it tomorrow . Wait a minute . Where is that photograph ? What photograph ? CHUCK : The original one , from yesterday . I still got time to get it in tomorrow 's paper . Compared to this mug shot , I look like Paul Newman . You threw it out . I did ? Yeah . All right . All right , come on , let 's go . Go where ? Come on ... they 're not going to pick up the garbage until tomorrow morning . What are you , crazy ? I 'm not going in a Dumpster . ( Chuck sighs ) CHUCK : Fine , I 'll get it myself . ( door closing ) Marissa , what do you say I make us both dinner ? Sure , why not ? ( Spike barking ) The three of us . ( cat meowing ) All right , dinner for four . Forget it , man- - the food stinks here . CHUCK : Like I said , it 's a competitive world out there . One day , you 're up . The next day , it 's the Dumpster . Oh , no . My pictures . Still , there 's always hope ... so keep your chin up . And don 't forget to wipe off the schmutz . I got your letter of resignation , Fred . Are you sure you want to do this ? You 're a valuable guy here . ( chuckling ) I didn 't save my job the other day . Gary did . I don 't know how exactly , but he did . And it made me realize something . I don 't want this job anymore . You 're not serious . Fred 's going into teaching . And you made my decision a whole lot easier , Sandy . So , you did help Fred make his score . Fred didn 't need his score . He 's going to do what he wants to do . Don 't kid me . Look , I want a shot at the brass ring , too , Gary , and I 'm not too fussy about how I get it . I ... I don 't know how I can help you , Sandy . Just take a look at this buy order for Nokatech Systems . Shall I load my personal portfolio with it ? Look , Sandy , I don 't know . Those are ... those are high-tech stocks . They 're very volatile- - I ... So , you 're saying that 's a good bet ? Well ... I don 't know , Sandy . I mean , it 's ... it 's a very personal decision . We 'll keep this between you and me . Absolutely . Thanks . Hey , give me a call sometime . I 'll show you my upside . I 'll do that , Sandy . Hey ... so what did the Dragon Lady say ? A stock tip , if you can believe it . Did you give her one ? No , I didn 't . At least , I think I didn 't . Yeah , I 'll come by and audit that class of yours , huh ? Gary , you do that , buddy . I 'll see you around . Take care ... take care , Joanne . Okay . You too , Gary . Hey , you , uh , stop by the restaurant any time- - we 'll squeeze you in . Count on it . Okay ... okay . Bye-bye . See you . Adiós . CHUCK : No one likes to admit it . It 's an uncomfortable truth . The human face is broadly divided into two categories : winners and losers .

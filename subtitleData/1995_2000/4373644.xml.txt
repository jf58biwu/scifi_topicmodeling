 We 've got a bandit over the bow . [ McQueen ] This has never happened in this war , sir . A wounded enemy bird . Now we know where they 're from . Let 's pay ' em a hostile visit . - It 'll be our Trojan horse . - It 's a suicide mission , Commodore . We 're losing her . [ Murmuring ] [ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] Hawkes . [ Grunts ] We got company . [ Grunting ] Let 's move ! We 're gonna get you out of here . I promise . Hang on . - [ Panting ] - Stay back . Wait . Now . - I 'm out . - Two rounds . Hawkes , what are you doin ' ? - I ain 't leaving ' ' em . - We 're outnumbered . - The only way we can save them is to save ourselves first . - All right . - [ Man # 1 ] Can 't go on . - [ Man # 2 ] Move it . Let 's go . Move it . Go . Come on . - Move it . - Hey . [ Woman ] Nathan ! Nathan ! Nathan ! Nathan , it 's Kylen ! [ All Grunting ] Nathan . ! Nathan . ! Kylen . ! We 're entering the Cerus system , sir . We got a 155 . We got a 154 . - No indications of an alien fleet . - Be on alert . They may be positioned on the dark side of the planet . Talk to me , Marine Lieutenant Webb . I want a report on that wreckage . Is that a Chig bomber ? We 're scanning the debris now , but it 'll take time to reassemble . Sir , we could get jumped out here by the Chigs ... - at any second . - Patience , Lieutenant Krantz . We didn 't take the risk of coming all this way to leave empty-handed . Did we ? [ Webb ] Got it . Stand by for V.R. Reassembly . [ Woman ] Alien bomber extrapolation is up , screen two . - Fuselage . - [ Beep ] Cockpit . Weapons chamber . There 's a huge chunk missing right here . Looks like a missile impact . It 's a life pod . We studied the bomber before you did . Apparently we did a better job . There 's an escape vehicle in that section , Commodore . And your pilots seem to have used it . [ Electricity Crackling ] Him . Semper fi . Let 's go . Move it . Come on . - [ Panting ] - [ Groans ] [ Panting ] [ Groans ] Go on , Hawkes . I 'm slowing you down . - No way , Colonel . The A.I. ' s are tracking us . - Stay with me , you die . Now you go on , you find a way out for all of 'em . - For all of us . Come on . - Go ! That 's an order , Lieutenant . [ Man ] You 've done a very bad thing . What 's your name ? Hmm ? You can call me Elroy-El 1327 . I was designed as a humor model . A silicate to make you smile . Mmm . Oh . Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk . Now , I know you 're allowed to tell me your name ... and I just hate people who are impolite . Wang , Paul . First lieutenant , number 9483034828 . Well , it 's nice to meet you ... Wang , Paul , 948-34-30928 . I 'd like to welcome you to our little penal work facility . [ Chuckles ] Now , I 'm sure there 's a gag in there somewhere . Yes . Sure there is . Well ... let me fill you in on what we 're up to here , Wang , Paul , okay ? You 're in alien-occupied territory ... but I 'm sure you knew that , right ? Oh , and by the way ... they hate when you call them aliens and Chigs . Oh . Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk . In fact , they call you " alien " ... and a name that translates - well , loosely ... into " red stink creature . " It 's a little more poetic , of course , when they say it , but - [ Sniffing ] Your blood smells repugnant to them . They 're a wonderful species . Yes . And we A.I. ' s get on with them very well . In fact , we run this prison facility for them ... because the air is just impossible on them . Uh-huh . In return , we get to keep ... certain raw fuels that are mined . Now that 's very fair . [ Neck Cracks ] Wouldn 't you say ? Yes . They are very , very fair . Kind , caring ... just . - All the things you carbonites are not . - [ Groans ] Right , Wang , Paul ? Yeah . You know , you ... invaded their territory first , didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? You threatened them first , now , didn 't you ? [ Whispers ] Didn 't you ? And this morning ... you murdered innocent lives . Civilian lives . Young lives . Didn 't you , Wang , Paul ? - With your insensitive bombing attack . - [ Electricity Crackling ] [ Crackles ] Didn 't you ? - [ Crackles ] - [ Grunts ] Yes . [ Paul Screaming ] [ Shield Hums ] - [ Electronic Twitter ] - [ Shield Whooshes ] [ Whoosh ] Choice or chance ? Chance or choice ? - [ Electronic Twitter ] - [ Whoosh ] [ Whoosh ] Choice or chance ? [ Electronic Twitter ] [ Scraping ] - Kylen ? - Nathan ? Nathan . Where are you ? How can I get to you ? No , no . Shh . Don 't talk . There 's no time . We know a way out . It 's dangerous . Another will help us . Be ready . It could be at any time . Just be ready . I love you . [ Electronic Twitter ] [ Whispers ] Quick , quick ! Put it back ! Put it back ! Believe in me . [ Rustling ] - [ Grunts ] - I went back to the life pod . - No sign of the Cards . - I thought I told you to go on without me . I followed the road they left by , but I couldn 't find where they took ' em . Time 's running out , Colonel . We gotta find them . [ Grunting ] - Come on , sir . You better take it easy . - We gotta move . There 's an A.I. Patrol that direction . Is that a problem ? - [ Beeps ] - [ Shield Whooshes ] Come on . Let 's go . - Come on . - Shh . - [ Electronic Twitter ] - [ Panting ] [ Groaning ] [ Groans ] Come on ! He 's dead ! Come on . Easy . Easy . - We 're not safe here . - I can 't leave them . Nathan , it took Crossland and me six months to plan a way out . I 'm not going back . He shouldn 't have died for nothing . - Didn 't you come for me ? - And they came with me . [ Panting ] I 'm bleeding . It 's not that bad . It 's just a cut . I never thought I 'd feel your breath on my face again . I won 't leave them . And I can 't leave you . Remember who you are . Who you are . Okay . All-time Chicago Cubs team . First base , Ernie Banks . Mr. Cub . Second base . Ryno . Ryne Sandberg . Lifetime batting average - I can 't remember . Shortstop . Shortstop . That would have to be - Wait . Don 't tell me . Luis DeJesus . Back-to-back M. V.P. ' s in 2055 and 2056 . He left for the money . He went to the Mets . He was a traitor . Yes . See ? Isn 't it so much nicer that we talk ... rather than hurting each other ? [ Paul Screaming ] Paul . In a while it 'll be us . As marines , it 's our duty not to cooperate . As friends , we stick together . - [ Screaming Continues ] - That 's the problem . - [ Electronic Twitter ] - [ Shield Whooshes ] - [ Whoosh ] - That 's the problem with you carbonites . - [ Screaming Continues ] - You meet someone by chance . At school , work . Just by chance . But then you make it a choice to bring them into your life . - [ Screaming Continues ] - For a night , for a year ... for a lifetime . Sometimes you choose ... to stay with a person so long that ... right before your eyes ... you watch them die . So why wait a lifetime ? Our employers have decided ... one of you is to be executed ... and the other will spend their life working in the mine . And they 're leaving the choice up to you . Go to hell . [ Groans , Electronic Twitter ] See ? It 's really not so tough ... once you set your mind to it . [ Shield Whooshes ] [ Groans ] That 's for the old Corps . What now ? [ Man ] I 'm picking up a transmission . Put it on speaker . [ Electronic Twittering ] And now , with a little tweaking of this A.I. Motherboard ... we 've got enough power to boost the signal . [ Beeping ] " 58 . " Four prisoners . - One hurt . " - Localize that transmission . - We 've triangulated the signal . - [ Beeping ] It 's dead center in alien territory , and it 's ... not making any sense . " Sailor 's grog . Sailor 's grog . " That 's McQueen . [ McQueen ] Not enough power left to transmit . [ Cooper ] I 'll bet they heard it . Not even an A.I. Would take that bet , Cooper . We gotta find the others . A.I. ' s are networked through their modems . So when you re-initialize ' em , they give up their home location . Near the end of the A.I. War I , was a P.O.W. They do , uh , stuff to ya ? It 's frightening how much pain an InVitro - a human body can stand . You 'd like to believe the body would break before the will . I held out three days . Then ... once when they were ... doin ' stuff to me ... I heard screaming . Sounded far off , down the hall . I remember thinkin ' ... " That poor bastard . What must he be goin ' through ? " Then when I came to I realiyed the screams had come from me . Save your last bullet , Hawkes . Why 'd you come on this mission ? How come - How come you 're willing to die for humans ? I could ask you the same question . You 're an InVitro too . This ain 't my idea . Damn judge decided I oughta be a grunt . That 's not your story . I mean , most Tanks just sat out the A.I. War . Why would you give your life for a human ? I did it - I do it ... for every InVitro who 's ever been called a Tank or a Nippleneck . I do it so no one - human or invitro - will ever be able to say that all InVitros ... are lazy , or cowards , or don 't stand for anything . [ Male Voice ] Transmission received . 140219 . Kazbek Penal Colony , G.P.S. Grid number 9 , Baker , .3 . Found ' em . We need one more thing . Cool . No windows . No vents . Could we bribe them with chocolates and panty hose ? They pass through this opening . - [ Electricity Crackling ] - I hate when you make me do that , Wang , Paul . Although , look at you . Wow . I really wish I was human . What must what I 'm doing to you feel like ? What must you be going through ? Ah . Veins all blue . - Perspiration . - [ Panting ] Pulse racing . Hey . Why are you giving your life for them , huh ? This war is being run by a bunch of Harvard white guys . What do you owe them ? Hmm ? Are you tired , Wang , Paul ? Are you thirsty ? Are you hungry ? Would you like a hamburger ? Huh ? I can help you . Yes . No one else can help you but me . Ah . You 're ready . I can see it in your eyes . Outfield . Dawson , Andre . The Hawk . Ah . Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk . - Think you 'll never crack , huh ? - Never . I 'd like you to hear something . It 's a playback of a recording . [ Paul 's Voice Screaming ] Sound familiar ? Oh , well , perhaps you don 't recognize it . Of course . You were unconscious at the time . But that is you . Screaming , Wang , Paul . Yes . I 've already broken you , haven 't I ? Huh ? Haven 't I ? Haven 't I ? Oh , no . - No . It 's okay . - [ Sobbing ] It 's okay . - Shh . - No . Shh . Oh , please . I 'm sorry . It was for your own good . Listen , Wang , Paul . Your boy Elroy will never hurt you again . Okay ? I promise . Scout 's honor . But listen . I want you to do something for me . All right ? It 's a small thing . It won 't take long . I promise . Okay ? Will you do that for me ? - Hmm ? - Yeah . Yeah . I 'll do anything you ask . Oh . Good boy . Good . Good boy . It 's okay , Vanessa . In here I kind of like it . Sort of reminds me of home . Vanessa ... if we can 't get out ... then it 's gonna be me . No . It 's neither . Look , I joined knowing marines die . That 's what they 're here for . Yeah . So what am I ? If they put you to work , there 's a chance of escape . - You have a family . - So do you . Not like you . You have a mother and a father ... and a man who is just waiting for you to come home . - His daughter - - No . I won 't let you do it . And you shouldn 't let me do it . We may have no choice . - Now you sound like them . - For once , those ... things ... they - they made sense . Our families are given to us by chance ... but you can 't choose for your family not to have you in their lives . I won 't let them remove you from your family . Don 't turn . [ Whispers ] In the shadows behind you ... a Chig is watching . So maybe that 's what they 're getting out of this . Our enemy is studying its enemy 's loyalty to one another . They 're watching how we react . [ Chuckles ] We 're hamsters . Guinea pigs . Right . What do you think ? Well ... maybe ... we should give them what they expect . [ Elroy-El ] What is your name ? Wang , Paul . First lieutenant , 58th Squadron , United States Marine Corps . And what would you like to tell the people on Earth ? I caused the death of innocent beings . How ? - I violated the Chig - - Oh . Tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk . Careful . Careful . I killed noncombatants . I dropped bombs on civilian populations . I destroyed the innocent . Are you guilty of war crimes ? Yes . Hmm . And how does what you 've done make you feel , Lieutenant ? I feel shame . [ Electronic Whirring ] [ Whirring ] Hawkes . [ Electronic Twitter ] [ Grunts ] [ Electricity Crackling ] Colonel . Take a look at this . [ McQueen ] What the hell is that ? Hey . Hey ! - Hey . - [ Electronic Twitter ] Come here . I want to be the one who remains alive . And I 'll do whatever it takes to be the one . Anything . When we return , you must kill her . [ Nathan ] The prison is about two klicks . - Two klicks ? - It 's military slang for kilometer . It 's hard to imagine you in the military . Just the uniform . It was the only way to get to you . The A.I. ' s tell us that we lose every battle ... that the Chigs are impossible to attack . - It was until yesterday . - How did you bomb them ? How did you know we bombed them ? It was what the prisoners were saying . They said a ship would come for you . For the others . Is that true ? You can tell me . If we didn 't return ... the Saratoga was to lead a fleet around the far side of the Butterfly Nebula . Interference from the nebula would make it impossible for the Chigs to track the fleet . They 're entering the Cerus system through the back door . Then there 's no need to go back to the prison . The marines will get their men . Stop it . Stop it . I risked my life for you . They risked their lives for you . Don 't you understand ? You don 't understand . She would . [ Man ] Sir , we have LIDARcontact . - What and where ? - Their fleet 's emerging from the dark side , sir . Set general quarters . - [ Man On P.A. ] All hands , general quarters . - We 'll take some of 'em with us . You led us into this . You know better than that , sir . Sir , the fleet 's heading away from us . Bearing leads them toward the Butterfly Nebula . We must have avoided detection . This is your window of opportunity , Commodore . It 's a straight shot . We don 't do it now , we don 't know when they 'll be back . Set course for Kazbek . Let 's get our people back . Decisions , decisions . - [ Electronic Twitter ] - [ Shield Whooshes ] - I understand you 've made a choice . - [ Whoosh ] And it is to say that you can stick it in any artificial orifice of your choice . - That 's not what I heard . - [ Beep ] [ Vanessa 's Voice ] I want to be the one who remains alive . And I 'll do whatever it takes to be the one . In craps we 'd say Damphousse bet the don 'ts . I don 't buy it . You created that . It 's a lie . No . It 's not . What the hell is this ? Look , Vansen . You said it yourself . I have a family . I 've got somebody waiting for me . I can 't believe that you would do this to me . [ Electronic Twitter ] You 've shown you 're the one who can 't be trusted . Pull anything , Brandon pulls the trigger . How can you live with yourself , Damphousse ? A least I 'll live . [ Electronic Twitter ] You 're Brando , babe . You 're De Niro , girl . [ Electronic Twitter ] Our enemy is attacking the prison , Wang , Paul . They 've done a very bad thing . I want to thank you for all you 've done for us . And I want you to know you only hurt the one you love . No ! Don 't kill him . Yes . Yes . Yes . [ Gunshots ] [ Electronic Twittering ] Come on , man . Come on , man . We still can 't get out of here . [ Electronic Twitter ] She 's our ticket . 'Phousse . - Ready ? Ready ? - [ Electronic Twitter ] [ Shield Whooshes ] [ McQueen ] Vansen . - Where 's West ? - I don 't know . They took him . [ Man ] Seventeen mikes to planet fall . Multiple bogies , bearing 3-niner , A-Z 90 . - Closing fast . Alien bombers . - Battle stations ! There are far more bombers than our intelligence indicated . Gunners , target the bombers ... three degrees past the highest point of their return arc . How did you know that ? It took us nine Charno mainframes to extract that information . All your secrets and intelligence can 't take the place of human experience . Take ' em out of my sky . [ Woman ] Fire mission , multiple targets . All batteries , fire at will . Popped ' em , sir . I want a force recon assault team on planet in 10 mikes . I want our people out . - [ Click ] - [ Kylen 's Voice ] I believe in you . [ Shouting In Distance ] Take cover ! - Take cover ! - Wang ! [ Yells ] What the hell 's the matter with you ? You want to get yourself killed ? You 're gonna get someone else killed right along with you . Wang , Vansen , Damphousse , this way . This way . Nathan , no ! I never told it who you were . [ Electronic Twitter ] [ Vanessa ] Oh , God , Nathan . Oh , God . - Colonel . - [ Rumbling ] [ Man ] Move out . Move . ! Move . ! Go . ! Move . ! All right , gentlemen . Let 's go . We got five mikes left . Move , move , move . ! - All accounted for . - We 'll clean up . - All right . - [ Man ] Go . Keep steady . [ Door Closes ] When I 'm on a battlefield ... and I see a human - dead - I can tell . L - I can feel something is missing . Something unexplainable is gone . A.I. ' s - they 're like the living dead . You can feel they have no souls . That 's how I knew it wasn 't her . You think we 'll catch heat because we missed the target ? I think we should prepare to be seen as a disappointment . - [ Banging ] - [ Door Opens ] [ Man ] All right . Let 's go . Get on board . - Hustle up . - [ Man # 2 ] Hustle up . - Move it . Move it . - Come on . [ Chattering ] [ Chattering ] [ Woman ] Shuttle 375 clear for arrival , Pad 6 . [ Man ] Roger . Thank you . 58 , you believed in an act that couldn 't be done . You put your lives on the line for that belief ... and returned with both . Welcome home . - [ Whistle ] - [ Man ] Boo-yah . ! [ Man # 2 ] Greatjob . [ Man # 3 ] Welcome back . - [ Man # 4 ] That 's what it 's all about . - [ Woman ] Well done . Welcome home . I said this was yours when you got back . You 're a hero . Paul . Paul . [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

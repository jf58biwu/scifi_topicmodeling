 MRAZ : This situation poses a grave and serious threat . The secrecy of the project must be protected at all costs . SOPHIE : Dear Tom : I write not knowing if this will ever find or reach you . I was contacted by someone a woman I know nothing about but whose appearance has given me hope that you are somehow still very much alive . Prompt and uniform denial . How do I begin to explain ? I feel my life has been taken away from me , as you have . That nothing is as it seems . I have no one to turn to , Tom , except this woman I speak of who has told me to pursue the truth in spite of all the official evidence of your death . It seems crazy , like chasing down a phantom but what choice do I have if you 're out there ? The Army issues only denials . And though this woman gives me little to go on it is enough . [ THUNDERING ] I have so many questions , Tom and trust she wouldn ' t put me through this if there weren ' t a reason . I want so badly to believe what she 's telling me that you were taken from me and are being held somewhere . That our own government is involved . That an official lie is being passed off about you . A lie only I seem to have knowledge of . I don ' t know where I don ' t know why but I know I will never stop searching until I find out . I will continue to write , Tom , sending my letters through her waiting to hear from you and will try to be patient . [ BEEPING ] SANTIAGO : To begin again to wipe the slate clean wouldn 't Jefferson or Hamilton or Madison do the same if they could see their legacy now ? What their beloved country has become . INGA : Long live the new monarchy . Did we find the leak ? How this woman knows about Hobbes ? No . We will . HOBBES : A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world . Your family and friends . And though you may not know it , I was sent to save you . It 's just a game . HOBBES : Every minute of every hour , every hour of every day I have but one waking thought : Survive . I 've been running for weeks traveling with two strangers who have become my friends though I use this word cautiously . Nothing is certain in Harsh Realm . Not even your next breath . Though we run , I 'm no closer to my destination : Home . My friend Pinocchio says there 's no sure way out except for a rumored portal by which General Santiago passes between worlds . Though he says it may be impossible to reach it alive I 'm willing to take my chances . [ MUSIC PLAYS ] HOBBES : What is this place ? - Zip fights . - What ? - Zip fights . HOBBES : I thought we were looking for help . Freddie the Forger . We want him for what ? To move around the city , you need an ID chip . To find that portal , you 'll need one . He forges them . - This guy Freddie 's here ? - That 's what we 're gonna find out . [ CHEERING ] DJ : Bloodsuckers and perverts , grab a vein and start pumping because we got action , action and more action ! Step up to the moneyman in the bow tie and place your bets . Place them good . Take your hand with lady luck , maybe you 'll get lucky . Those of you looking for fortune , pass it over and give it up for Miss Nancy ! Bonita ! And up in the rafters there , we got Angel , Sugar , Spice all the princesses of passion . They aim to please , or if you 're broke , only tease . All bubble gum and G-strings , ready to dance for your desire . So give it up for our lovely ladies of love ! [ WHISTLING ] Lovebirds and lunatics , if I can direct your attention to the center of our establishment . Feast your eyes on our optican of oppression , where our two contestants who , straight from the heart of our stupid legal system where they couldn 't resolve matters , agreed to pummel each other for our viewing pleasure in an attempt to settle the score once and for all ! Get ready , all you flesh-pounding worshipers ... - What are they ? - Zip files . Fight to the death . - A zip file ? - Two hundred and fifty pounds of digitally compressed testosterone . - What ? I give you , in the yellow corner , wearing yellow trunks from parts unknown , weight unknown , height unknown . He likes walks on the beach and quality time alone with his cat . The man in the yellow trunks ! His opponent , in the red corner , wearing red trunks , from parts unknown weight unknown , height unknown . Don 't know what to say other than I bet against him . The man in the red trunks ! Ladies and gentlemen , fasten your seat belts because we are ready to get it on ! Wait here . Pinocchio . Hey ! WATERS : Troops are mobilizing as I speak . Operation begins at 2200 hours . When it 's done , we 'll add to our borders 60 miles of eastern seaboard . Put the entire state of New Jersey completely under siege . That 's a total of five states now under our dominion . Well on our way to a United States of Santiago . Are we expecting any resistance ? We 've hit this area before , but there 's an entrenched hard core . Who will be in charge of this ? I 'm leaving this briefing directly to lead my men , sir . SANTIAGO : Strike quickly and brutally . The mighty sword of justice knows no scabbard , major . Great empires are built on the wisdom of sages and the blood of heroes . Yes , sir . INGA : Major Waters . You were bold in there . Good . That ambition will take you places . Great places . Just don 't fail . I 'm looking for Freddie the Forger . [ SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] Freddie . Hey , Freddie . Did you hear me call you ? I 'm talking to you . We can do this here or someplace else . Fine . Where do you think you 're going ? For a walk . - You didn 't ask for my permission . - I didn 't know I had to ask . I know you . Major , isn 't it ? Major Optican . I love a man in a uniform . Ah ! Stay here . [ EXPLOSION ] [ SIREN WAILING ] Heavy artillery . We 're under attack . MAN : Clear the building ! WATERS : You 're under arrest . Do not resist . PINOCCHIO : Florence , stop Freddie . He 's got the chips ! Ah ! WATERS : You are under arrest . Do not resist . Come on ! Let 's go ! Get on the ground ! Down ! Down ! PINOCCHIO : Stuck ! It won 't move . If you unleash me , I can show you a way out of here . Go . WATERS : This way ! Over here ! Soldiers , I saw them . There 's a glitch here . Find it . I want those soldiers alive . MAN : Hands on your head . Move along . [ HELICOPTER HOVERING ] SOLDIER : Get on the truck ! Secure the weapons over here for destruction . Come on ! Come on ! Let 's move it , hose bags ! WATERS : Grab her ! I know you . I 've seen you . They 're here , aren 't they ? Pinocchio and Hobbes . Process her with the rest of the coin slots . [ DOG BARKING ] MAN OVER RADIO : Whiskey-zero-three . Objective secured . All units clear surrounding areas . HOBBES : I can 't see anything . PINOCCHIO : This is some way out . - Where are we , Freddie ? FREDDIE : I don 't know . It 's a place the ladies used to hide . HOBBES : This man 's supposed to help us ? - Now who have I disappointed ? - Name 's Hobbes . He needs a chip to go inside Santiago City . Let me tell you what , I 'm fresh out . If you haven 't noticed , Santiago City came to us . I 'm looking for a portal to get back to the real world . Join the crowd , Little Nell . - Do you have the chip or not ? - It wouldn 't help right now , would it ? I think we 're in some kind of a digital void . Some kind of unprogrammed game space . Now look what you 've done . No . - He can 't see us . - He 's looking right at us . PINOCCHIO : It 's the latrine . - Oh , yeah . So it is . [ WATER FLUSHING ] Don 't , Hobbes . We can use him . - Lf you kill him , he 'll disappear . - He killed Sophie . - Listen to me . - He killed my girl ! He killed her virtual character . She 's still alive in the real world . He can lead you to her . Don 't move . Don 't even flinch . All right . I 'm not moving . You wet yourself , major . For God 's sake , button up . He told me not to move . PINOCCHIO : Well , I don 't like looking at your shortcomings . Let 's go . Up ! Ah ! You 're a murderer , Waters . I didn 't mean to kill her , Hobbes . - I didn 't . - Who were you shooting at , me ? ID chip , Hobbes . Your ticket home . You work with this , Freddie ? You bet . What about anesthetic ? - Ah ! - General . I can ... Wait a second . I can help you . I owe you . You got my word . - The boy just wants to go home . - Santiago has a portal . It 's impossible . Where is it ? Where is it ? Ask him . What , you know where it is ? I used to work for Santiago , okay ? Central Security , 14th floor . You need clearance . It 's encoded on his implant . - Freddie , cut him . - Done . [ SCREAMING ] - They got the damn city fenced . - Which side are we on ? - The wrong side . - We 're on Santiago 's side . It shouldn 't be like this . The place is crawling with them . But we know where the portal is . - Yeah , and we only get one ID chip . - I 've come too far to turn back . - I 'm going in . - Where you getting directions chamber of commerce ? FREDDIE : I 'll get him there . - I 'm going with him . - You can 't . I wanna see this real world , see what all the fuss is about . - Why can 't he go ? - Because he can 't . He 's a virtual character . A concept , part of a game . - He doesn 't exist . - Really ? Who saved your fuzzy butt back there anyway ? Hey , 40 miles from here to Santiago City . Light of day , you 'll never make that portal . Unless you got another way in or a wormhole up your sleeve . Hobbes ! Hey ! - You 'll get him killed . - Since when did you start caring ? I wanna go home . Don 't you ? INGA : Major Waters General Santiago 's asked for you . I believe it 's to commend you . Tell him I 'll be right there . I wanted to commend you myself . On achieving your objective . And yours . No . I 've only just begun . - You know what we 're risking . - It can all be ours . INGA : You 're bleeding . You 're hurt . How did this happen ? Setting a trap . HOBBES : The streets of Santiago City are clean and orderly . Its office towers proud and tall . There is no suffering here , no privation . But this is a utopia for which a terrible price has been paid . The lives of all those who live outside the fence . - What are we doing ? PINOCCHIO : What you asked . Getting to that portal . HOBBES : This is a residential building . - You won 't get far dressed like that . [ BUZZING ] Told you , used to work here . What the ... ? Biometric iris scanner , wired to a tungsten-alloy dead bolt in the door . It 's impossible to bypass . Oh , yeah ? Ten-hut , major . E-ticket . WOMAN OVER TV : Santiago City , a place of freedom , a place of family . More than just a city , it 's an ideal built on the rubble of the past working toward a safe and prosperous future . A future of liberty and justice . As Santiago City expands its borders into the new frontier making way for a growing population , made strong by its love of freedom ... The Santiago Channel . ... and commitment to equality and democracy . - All Santiago , all the time . - We will always be one people one nation , one Santiago . Just don 't change the dial . Oops . Dare we forget that life 's just a big bowl of cherries here in Omar 's world . Yo , Gilligan , Mary Ann . Get naked . We got work to do . Who is this guy ? Freddie 's black-market connection for these ID chips . Wonder what Santiago would do to an officer dealing in Harsh Realm . Probably what this officer 's been doing to Freddie . - Isn 't that right ? - Oh , yeah . - He 's been a bad , bad boy . - Ah ! Where 's our ride ? Damn it . - Came all this way just to get towed . - Doesn 't make any sense . Anyone want me to try clicking my heels ? How do we get there ? How do we get to the portal ? Let 's let Santiago drive us . Come on . Go , Hobbes . All aboard . - There 's no driver . - Tell her where you 're going . Hold still , let her read the chip . HOBBES : Central Security . Central Security . What are you waiting for ? - I got business . - What are you talking about ? - You 're practically home . - I 'm not going . - Get on the bus , Pinocchio . - I got my reasons ! They got nothing to do with you . You may only get this one chance , Hobbes . Don 't screw it up . HOBBES : Hey ! Hey , Pinocchio ! You knew Pinocchio from before . My line of work , you meet people . - Why wouldn 't he want to go home ? - I don 't know . Freedom , maybe ? Harsh Realm is like a jungle . But , hey at least you don 't die of old age . - But he used to live here inside the fence , working for Santiago . Yeah . He had it real good inside here . Till he pissed off Santiago . Word is he wouldn 't do his bidding . But , hey , that 's the way it is in here . You question His Majesty , and it is off with your head , Marie Antoinette . So , what makes you think the real world 's any better ? I hear there 's a place in the real world where no one shoots at you tries to make you into something you 're not . Is it true ? I hope so . COMPUTER : Next stop , Central Security . WATERS : Get up , Pinocchio . Never were much good at taking orders , were you ? No , I always had some spine . Just couldn 't do the job . I just wouldn 't do it , Mel . Difference between you and me : I couldn 't kiss the ass you kiss . - I couldn 't stomach all the killing . - You wanna see what it takes ? You won 't do it , Mel . I 'm all you got . All you got to show Santiago when Hobbes escapes from Harsh Realm . - Hobbes won 't escape . - You taking bets on that ? I got somebody making sure of it . You see , I not only got your old job , Pinocchio . I got your old lady too . Let him go . - Let him go back . - Why ? Let him go back to the real world . We 'll both get rid of a problem . COMPUTER : You are now approaching the Santiago Central Security Building . Please be prepared with proper identification . You are now approaching the Santiago Central Security Building . Please be prepared with proper identification . HOBBES : Wait . - What ? What are we waiting for ? - I don 't know . It 's too easy . That portal 's only 14 floors up . Fourteen floors , and you 're home . Come on , Hobbes , let 's go . You 're the one with the access chip . Come on . [ DOOR OPENS ] I 'd step away from there . You 've come a long way , Tom . - But you 're about to walk into a trap . - Who the hell is she ? I know you . Yes . You were there the day they sent me here , into Harsh Realm . - You were sent for a reason . - I don 't want to hear it . I just want to go home . The chip you have is stolen . The system has been reprogrammed to recognize you as an intruder . It will set off an alarm . You 'll never escape the building . It won 't work . You need a chip with the access data . Open it . I 'm trying to help you , Tom . Open it . - I 'm here as a friend , Tom . - Then try staying out of my way . I 've been to see Sophie . - She 's going to get us caught . - Shut up . She 's going to have a child , Tom . Your child . Open it . She needs you , Tom . We need you to stop Santiago . Look , if you 're not going to go , let me . - He wants to destroy the world . - Not the way I see it . The real world , Tom by planning the ultimate terrorism so that Harsh Realm is all that exists . COMPUTER : Security violation . Attempted double entry . Security violation . Attempted double entry . There 's been a mistake ! [ ALARM BEEPING ] - We 're dead . - He has men who believe in him . Influential men in the real world . I 've heard their plans . Then let me go there . You can 't find him in the real world . No one can , Tom . They 've tried . - I can 't help you . - You can , Tom . Only you . Stop Santiago here in Harsh Realm or there may be no home to go back to . No Sophie . No child . No , no , no ! Come on ! No ! No , help me ! Please ! Please help me ! Go on , help him . Then help yourself . HOBBES : The people here are without hope . Defeated . Unaware their fate is inextricably bound with ours . Santiago must not prevail here if our world is to survive . I will find a way to lead these people , Sophie , to help them save their world so that we can save ours . [ CROWD MUMBLING ] PINOCCHIO : What are you doing ? - Getting you out of here . - You were home free , Hobbes . Not as long as Santiago 's alive . You sorry bastard . She got to you . Inga . Didn 't she , Hobbes ? She gave me a letter and a key to get you out . I trusted her once . Let the devil put her tongue in my ear . I couldn 't run fast enough . You pretend that 's what you 're running from . INGA : What ? What is it ? I came close . Way too close . - To what ? - To getting caught . I had Hobbes and Pinocchio dead to rights set to deliver them to Santiago . - What happened ? They escaped . You had them , and you let them get away ? Hobbes has an ally . - Who ? - Someone on the inside . He got all the way to the portal and turned back . Someone got to him . How much does he know ? Whatever he knows , if Santiago finds out , it points to me . Hobbes could know everything . All Santiago 's plans . - He doesn 't . - What if he does ? Those plans are vital to us . They cannot fail or we fail . - He 's one man . One man . That 's who they say he is . The man who will save Harsh Realm who will defeat Santiago . You and I are the ones . We can 't risk this . It 's too dangerous . You 're vulnerable now . HOBBES : I write you , Sophie my courage strengthened by faith that my words have found a way to reach you that this woman , Inga Fossa , possesses influence not just in the game that is Harsh Realm , but in the real world . She says she has the power to travel back and forth that she will use her position to help us and although I 've been warned against her I want to believe her . I want so much to find someone else in this frightened world I can trust as I have come to trust a man who saved my life here . Another soldier who hates the world Santiago has created as I do . He 's a brave and resourceful man but still a mystery to me in many ways . He does not admit it but it 's clear to me now that he does not seek to return home . His reasons he keeps to himself . I will come home , Sophie . You are my light , my star my one true path through two worlds . Keep these words deep in your heart , my darling . I will fight my war . I will come home . I 'm sorry . I followed you . How long have you been waiting here ? Since ... A long time . I was afraid I 'd miss you . - You 're freezing cold . - I need to know about Tom , if you were able to reach him . I 'm sorry . We must keep trying . [ SOBBING ] Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

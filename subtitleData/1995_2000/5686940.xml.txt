Some type of enormous reptile we believe died out in the Cretaceous Period . So , where 's it been hiding the last 60 million years ? What about the traces of radiation ? The radiation isn 't an anomaly . It 's the clue . This animal is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur . Don 't tell me what it isn 't , tell me what the hell it is . What do we know ? It was first sighted ... off the French Polynesian Pacific , right ? That area has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the past 30 years . Hence the radiation . No , more than that .

After its initial attack ... he ... disappeared . OFFICER : Secretary of Defense Burk is on the line . I don 't understand . How could something so big just disappear ? - We 're not sure , but we 're scanning .. - He probably returned to the river . I don 't think so . I mean , look at it . It 's perfect . An island , water on all sides , but like no other island in the world . This is a place where he can easily hide . He 's in there someplace . SOLDIER : Channel 12 caught it on tape . CAIMAN : Hello .

[ INDISTINCT CHATTER ] CAIMAN : In what city officials are describing , as the worst act of destruction . since the World Trade Center bombing . Hundreds of thousands of people have jammed the streets . The largest evacuation in this city 's history . And many people , many , many people are not happy about it . Among those unhappy citizens are the managers of the stores . Along pricey Fifth and Madison Avenue . The Warner Bros. and Disney stores have been , totally cleared out by looters . And the streets are jammed . Traffic is at a standstill . Emergency vehicles cannot have access to , any emergency that may develop . And there is a slow but steady stream out of the city . as if Long island or New Jersey were any refuge , in this time of crisis . MAYOR : Ohh ! This is great ! If I 'm wrong on this evacuation , they 'll string me up from the Liberty torch . Didn 't we agree that we weren 't to have any sweets until after the election ? Back off , Gene . - Mr. Mayor . - Who the hell are they ?

Finally you got a little chutzpah . Don 't wimp out on me . What if Caiman finds out ? Look , how often you think you gonna have an ex-boyfriend on the inside of a major story ? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity . If I could just stick this thing . You got any glue ? or something ? I 'm sorry . I left my forgery kit at the office . [ FRENCH ACCENT ] MAN : Ahh ! Cafe !

But that 's where we are at this point . " " Now hold on . Hold on . " MAYOR : You 're telling me that in an election month , I 've evacuated the entire city for nothing ? Do you realize what this evacuation , Is gonna cost the people of this city ? COLONEL : We have been monitoring all the waters around the island . As far as we can tell , this thing has not left the area . Yes , but you don 't know for sure . We have a strong reason to believe it may be hiding , inside one of the buildings within the restricted area . But you don 't know for sure ! Mr. Mayor . We cannot give the " All clear " , until each and everyone of this building has been checked . - What is it ? - Excuse me , Sir . That may be more difficult than we originally projected . Ohh Terrific , Terrific ! More good news . We 've run into a problem . - Do you believe this ? - I don 't know what 's going on . You never know what 's going on . Thank you . SUBWAY STATION : 23RD STREET - Right here , Sir . - Fall in . Let 's go , people . Fall in downstairs . ♪ SGT O 'NEAL : Lt. Anderson and his men found this late this afternoon . LT . ANDERSON : We were checking the office building above , when we discovered the floor was gone . When we discovered he could burrow through the tunnels , we realized that ... We realized he could be outside the quarantined zone . Holy Christ ! How many tunnels lead off the island ? Only 14 . We 've checked them all . He hasn 't used any of them . - Have them all sealed up . - Yes , sir . How ? H .. H .. How would we do that , sir ? Fill them with cement . Brick them up . Put land mines in them , Bombs . I don 't care ! Make sure the damn thing doesn 't leave the island ! Yes , sir . NICK : You know , he 's not some enemy trying to evade you . - He 's just an animal . - What are you suggesting ? When I had to catch earthworms , I knew the best way to get them was not to dig them out , but to draw them out . All we need to do is to find out what he needs . And he 'll come to you .

Well , I 'm sorry you feel that way . Audrey ? You 're right . Eight years is a long time . Can I make you a cup of tea ? Sure . That 'd be nice . I still can 't believe it . I mean , how does a guy go from anti-nuke activists , who working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ? Well , when you and I went to rallies together in college , we helped to create awareness . But now , from the inside , I 'm able to effect real change . And exactly what changes are you trying to effect ? I 'm preparing a census for the government . I 'm cataloging new species that have been created , as a direct result of nuclear contamination . Is that what you think created this thing ? Yeah . I found a blood sample earlier this evening . How close did you get to the thing ? I got pretty close . And what else did you find out ? Well , we know he eats tons of fish . He 's amphibious . He 's a burrower . And ... He 's pregnant . He is ? He ! A very unusual he . I mean , obviously these tests weren 't designed for this . But , fundamentally they look for the same hormonal patterns to indicate pregnancy . Wait ! I don 't get it . If he 's the first of his kind , How can he be pregnant ? I mean , doesn 't he need a mate ? Not if he reproduces asexually . Where 's the fun in that ? I kept thinking , why would he travel so far ? But it makes perfect sense . Lots of animals travel great distances for reproduction . That 's what he 's doing in New York . He 's nesting . - Nesting ? - Yes . Do you realize that a lizard can lay , up to 12 eggs at a time ? - Think of it . - No . I didn 't know that . Forgive me . I .. I have to ... I have to get this to the lab , See if I can confirm all this . I 'll be right back . OLD COOK : ... Gojira ... Gojira ... Gojira ... [ POLICE RADIO ] [ POLICE SIREN ] Come on , Joey .

Come here a second . Hold on a second , All right ? What is it ? I 've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked . - You do ? - Yeah ! - Whose story is that ? - Mine ! [ BEEPING ] There 's a lot of movement down there . Military , police ... - Whoa , Whoa . - What ? - It 's my breakfast . - I 'm hungry . Shh . Quiet ! ... But , If we can lure him into a more ... open area such as this portion of Central Park .. I think we should be able to take him down . MAYOR : Last time you didn 't even scratch it . That 's not true . Our worm guy , I mean Dr. Tatopoulos , here has found blood . NICK : Yes . Yes , I did . So , You see , the only thing we need to do is get him out into open terrain , and use weapons that don 't rely on heat-seeking technology ... Um , Excuse me , sir . I think this situation has become , more complicated than that . The blood that I collected ... Revealed that the creature is either about to , lay eggs or already has . GOVERNOR : Are you trying to tell us that there 's another one of those things out there ? No , No , Governor . I don 't believe so . MAYOR : Wait a minute . Wait .. Wait ... Wait . Then how can it be pregnant ? What is this , the " virgin lizard ? " [ LAUGHS ] No . No . It reproduces asexually . That 's why we have to find the nest as soon as possible . Otherwise up to a dozen are going to be born , each one capable of laying eggs on its own . Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population . So , after we kill the creature , then we 'll search for the nest . No . I think it might be too late by then . These eggs gonna hatch very quickly . CLIVE : How could you possible know that ?

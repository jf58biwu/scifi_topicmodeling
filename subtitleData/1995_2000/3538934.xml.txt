 Ahh ! I can 't take it anymore ! They 've been at it for hours ! Give it a rest , you two ! Sorry ! A Fishful of Dollars [ SNORES ] Good morning , class . I trust you 've prepared for today 's final exam . Excuse me , I 've missed a few lectures . What subject is this ? Ancient Egyptian algebra . What a nightmare ! Mr. Fry , are those your underpants ? Young man , it 's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed-brand briefs . ANNOUNCER : Lightspeed fits an active lifestyle , whether you 're working or having fun . Lightspeed . Style and comfort for the discriminating crotch . Oh ! What a weird dream . I 'll never get back to sleep . You say they broadcast commercials into people 's dreams ? - Of course . - How is that possible ? FARNSWORTH : It 's very simple . The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg . Although in reality , it 's not liquid , but gamma radiation . That 's awful ! It 's like brainwashing . - Weren 't there ads in your time ? - Well , sure . But not in our dreams . Only on TV and radio , and in magazines and movies , and at ball games and on buses and milk cartons , and bananas and written in the sky . But not in dreams . No , sirree . Quit squawking . Nobody 's forcing you to buy anything . We all have commercials in our dreams . We don 't run off to buy brand-name merchandise at low , low prices . Care to sample our fragrance from Calvin Clone ? No , thanks . [ SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] - And you , sir ? - No , thanks- - COSMETOLOGIST : What a lovely face ! We just need to draw attention away from the eye area . [ ZAPPING ] [ GROANS ] Cool ! Can I try these on ? I can 't let you open the package . But you can try on the demo pair . [ GRUNTS ] Ooh ! Ho , ho , ho . Hi , Bender . Great new sweater . New ? ! What sweater ? I came here with it . I don 't know you people . $ 30 , please . $ 30 ! I can 't afford that . Unless ... . Do you take Visa ? Visa hasn 't existed for 500 years . - American Express ? - 600 years . - Discover card ? - Sorry , we don 't take Discover . Hey ! You buying Lightspeeds ? Pretty ritzy . No . I can 't afford them . Being poor sucks . They advertise things nobody can afford . [ MUSIC PLAYS ] Quiet ! There 's an ad coming on . Hello , shoppers . It 's me , Mom . Who 's the rocker jockey ? It 's Mom , the world 's most huggable industrialist . When my robots start to squeak like an old screen door that 's when I reach for a can of " Mom 's Old Fashioned Robot Oil . " BENDER : Tasty . And remember , Mom 's oil is made with 10 % more love than the next leading brand . ANNOUNCER : " Mom " , " Iove " , and " screen door " are trademarks of Mom Corp. [ BENDER SQUEAKS ] Sounds like you could use a little of that oil . - I 'm boned ! - Freeze , scuzzbot ! There 's obviously been some sort of a mistake here . I 'm sure there 's- - I say , I 'm sure there 's- - [ CANS FALLING ] That is , I 'm sure there 's a very reasonable ... . Do we have enough money to pay Bender 's fine ? 78 , 79 , 79.50 ... . Crud ! We 're 50 cents short . I 'd love to chip in , but Bender stole my wallet . FRY : That 's my old bank ! Maybe my account 's still open . We don 't have your retina scan , fingerprint or colonic map on file . I did open the account over 1 000 years ago . What about my ATM card ? Remember your PIN number ? It 's the price of a pizza and soda where I used to work , Pinucci 's Pizza . Okay . You had a balance of 93 cents . All right ! And at 2 percent interest over a period of 1 000 years that comes to 4.3 billion dollars . [ HYPERVENTILATES ] HERMES : To Fry ! AMY : Cheers ! I know Fry 's rich , but do we have to wear these hats ? Maybe you don 't understand just how rich he is . In fact , I think I better put on a monocle . FRY : Pizza dinner on me ! GROUP : All right ! Just keep the tab under 50 million dollars . I haven 't got all day . What kind of pizza you guys want ? We 'll have one with everything but anchovies . And one with my all-time favorite , anchovies . Invalid selection . What are you talking about ? You know , those little headless fish . Does not compute . Does not compute . I 'm sorry , Fry , but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200s . - What ? ! - Oh , my , yes . Fished to death . About the time your people arrived , wasn 't it , Zoidberg ? I 'm not on trial here . So none of you ever had anchovies ? You don 't know what you 're missing . They 're salty and oily , and they melt in your mouth- - Stop ! I admit it ! My people ate them all ! We kept saying , " One more can 't hurt , " and then they were gone . We 're sorry ! I wish I could show you how great they were . I 'm rich , but I can 't buy back things I miss from the 20th century . Maybe you 're forgetting how rich you are . Huh ? Huh ? Yeah ! Hmm ? What do you think ? I know you spent a lot of money , but it 's awfully primitive . The floors are made of such hard wood . Hey , get a load of this pathetic 20th-century TV ! What 's wrong ? Besides causing eye cancer , they had a lousy , low-definition picture . True . On this TV , I bet you couldn 't even make out my obscene tattoo . That 's cute . - Sold ! - Yes ! I just don 't get it . Who was this Ted Danson ? Why would you pay $ 1 0,000 for his skeleton ? - I have an idea for a sitcom . - Leave him alone , Leela . So he 's going wacko with his money . It 's okay . You 're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy . Yeah . It is cute . Now our final item . This unopened can of Angry Norwegian-brand anchovies , circa 1 997 . Anchovies ! The last known can in existence , guaranteed fresh and edible . Do I hear $ 1 0,000 ? - 1 5,000 ! - 20 ! - 30 . No , 40 ! - 50,000 ! [ MURMURING ] - Are you crazy ? It 's a can of fish . - Don 't tell me how to spend my money . - 50 . Going once , twice- - WOMAN : 75,000 . Oh , my God , it 's Mom ! I 've never seen her in person before . 1 00,000 ! You can 't bid against Mom . She 's the richest person in the world . And she 's so adorable . Well , I suppose I could go as high as ... 300,000 ! - 500 ! - Oh , mercy be . A million . - Two . Fourteen . - Six . I can see the nice young man really wants those little fish . Nevertheless , I 'll bid 23 million . One jillion dollars ! Sir , that 's not a number . In that case , 50 million . Well , boys . Your old mother knows when she 's been beat . You win , young man . I tip my bonnet to you . MAN : Isn 't she sweet ? What a class act ! Sold ! To the gentleman who bought every item in today 's auction . CROWD : Boo ! Now for some good old 20th-century TV . Ahh ! ANNOUNCER : Do you remember when cookies came fresh from the oven ? Petridge Farm remembers . Oh , those were the days . Remember when women couldn 't vote and certain folk weren 't allowed on golf courses ? Petridge Farm remembers . [ KNOCKING ] LEELA : Fry , are you there ? You haven 't been to work in days . What are you doing ? Sitting right here . I picked up my life where I left off 1 000 years ago . Now if you 'll excuse me , it 's 8 : 00 . Time to get busy . [ SIR MIX-A-LOT 'S " BABY GOT BACK " PLAYS ] You can 't just sit here listening to classical music . I could if you hadn 't shut off the stereo . This isn 't healthy . You 're living in the past . I 'm rich . I can live whenever I want . But we 're your friends , and we live here in the year 3000 . Now , are you gonna come to the squid fight with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk ? Junk ? Maybe you can 't understand this but I finally found what I need to be happy . Things , not friends . I 'm a thing . Just leave me alone . Fry , please ! [ KNOCKING ] My ponytail 's caught in the door . I don 't need them . I have my antique videos and my bucket of fossilized KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies . Mercy me . What a day . Could you shut the door , Edner dear ? I think I feel a draft coming on . Holy crap ! That bastard 's itchy ! Walt ! Cream soda ! Right away . Larry , get your mother a cream soda . But Mom said- - You heard me . - What 's wrong , Mommy ? - It 's those damned anchovies ! That dirtbag Fry must know their secret . And I won 't rest until I get my hands on them . No one messes with Mom . [ LAUGHING MANIACALLY ] Quiet , you ! As you know , one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom 's Old Fashioned Robot Oil . Think of it . Ten billion robots each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles . You don 't have to do the math to know that 's a buttload of oil ! Can I wear your suit ? - No , Edner ! Put that down ! - Oh . What 's oil have to do with anchovies ? I 'm getting to the freaking anchovies . One drop of the anchovy 's natural oil would lubricate 1 0 robots permanently . It 's a shame they 're extinct . No , it isn 't ! Shut your filthy clam ! Thank you , Walt . If anyone ever got hold of anchovy DNA they could stick the oil-making gene in a bunch of Third-World kids , and bam ! Cheap , effective robot oil . Enough to put dear old Mom out of business . My God ! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order . [ THEME FROM SANFORD AND SON PLAYS ] MAN : Esther , you ugly ! We have only one option . We 'll bankrupt Mr. Fry so he 'll have to sell the anchovies to us ! Mother , you are one clever old skag . And don 't you forget it . But how do we get Fry 's money out of the bank ? That 'll be easy , thanks to the nice people at Mom 's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit . Remember your PIN number ? It 's the price of a pizza and soda where I used to work , Pinucci 's Pizza . It 's the price of a pizza and soda- - - You know what needs to be done . - What ? Get his PIN number , you idiots ! Now I 'm off to some charity B.S. for knocked-up teenage sluts . [ KNOCKING ] WALT : Mr. Fry , it 's those three plumbers you called for . LARRY : We 're here to tighten your drains . [ SLAPPING ] I didn 't order any- - Quick ! Give him the tranquilizer ! That 's a good boy . Wake up , Mr. Fry . Where am I ? You 're in the good old year 2000 , working at Pinucci 's Pizza . You fell asleep on the job . That sounds like me . But I thought I got frozen . Wasn 't I in the future ? No . You only dreamed you were in the year 3000 . So I 'm really back ? That 's exactly what I wanted , I guess . - Who are you ? - I 'm Mr. Pinucci . You are ? Did you grow a mustache since last night ? No ! Go work the currency register . I think I hear a customer coming . I said , I think I hear a customer coming ! Oh , hurry . I want to get back to the head museum . Don 't worry . This won 't take long . Your motivation is you 're back in 2000 and your head 's still on your body and you want a cheese pizza . I 'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress . Hey , look . Anchovies . Of course . They 're not extinct yet . And if you need more proof that this is really 1 000 years ago well , here 's contemporary actress , Pamela Anderson . Ooh . Hello , Fry . Remember me from Baywatch : The Movie ? Uh ... . It was the first movie to be shot entirely in slow motion ! It hasn 't been made yet . - Then he doesn 't know I won the Oscar ? - Nope . Wait ! You 're Pamela Anderson ! Cool ! What can I get you ? I 'll have a cheese pizza and a large ... . - Line ! - Soda ! Oh , right ! Cheese pizza and a large soda . Cheese and a- - - That was quick . - So , what do I owe you ? $ 1 0.77 , same as my PIN number . Hey , you don 't get to laugh . Thanks a billion ! More like 4.3 billion . - Ow ! - Ow ! I had a nightmare . I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed . I 'm so glad I 'm awake now and you 're here . So you care about us ? You only care about anchovies and stuffy old songs about buttocks . No , that 's not true ! Goodbye ! Whee ! ANNOUNCER : This dream brought to you by Lightspeed ! Bender ! Leela ! Don 't leave me ! Wait a minute . Buddy , what year is this ? Uh , 3000 . 3000 ? Yes ! I 'm still in the future ! Life is wonderful ! What are you doing with my stuff ? Check bounced . We 're taking it all back . Oh , no . My ATM card ! My secret PIN number , 1 077 . I 've got nothing left . Except ... You 're Fry 's relative . Do you know how he got so crazy ? What ? They say madness runs in our family . Some even call me mad . And why ? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters ! Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of ... . Leela ! Bender ! I missed you so much . You did ? What happened ? I was robbed . They got everything except these . Who did ? Hello , Fry . It 's Mom ! I felt terrible when I heard about your money troubles . I thought I could help out a sweet , young man by buying his anchovies . Sorry , but they aren 't for sale . What ? Listen , you little bastard ! I control the robot-oil business ! I won 't let you ruin me ! How much ? Put that checkbook away , because I 've discovered something more important . My friends . And they aren 't worth even a penny to me . That 's why these anchovies are going on a pizza so I can share the food I love with the people I like . Holy hell ! You 're going to eat them ? Well , just make sure you eat them all . You 're a growing boy . Toodle-loo ! - Dumb ass . - What a nice lady ! Okay , my friends . Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you 've ever tasted . I don 't know . I 've had cow . Gross ! Mmm . No one likes them at first . They 'll grow on you . That stench ! That heavenly stench ! More . There 's no more . There never will be . More ! More ! More !

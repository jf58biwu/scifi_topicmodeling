 [ Breathing Heavily ] You know what he 's capable of . please . McFarland turned this into a witch-hunt . Who 's gonna burn at the stake ? Well , you should 've thought of that before you published the results . No , you should 've come to me before you went to McFarland . - I did , Jason , more than once . But- - - That 's bull ! You didn 't want to hear anything I had to say . You never did . - You deliberately went behind my back . - I did exactly- - What ? - Please . I need to talk to you . - Excuse us please . - That street is dangerous . - Right . Thank you . We 'll be fine . - Look . I 'm not gonna lie about this . - I 'm not asking you to lie . - What are you asking me to do ? - I 've traveled a long way . What ? You want some money ? Is that it ? Here 's a dollar . It 's all I have . - No . No . Listen to me . - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! - I 'm trying to save your life . - Hey , take it easy ! Let go ! What 's the problem here ? This old guy is harassing me ! - No , he 's just a little bit agitated . - No , he 's going to die ... at exactly 11 : 46 . - The bus ! The b- - - We 're all gonna die , Pop . - Come on . Let 's go sleep it off . - No ! - J-Jason ! - You 'll feel better in the morning . - Don 't let him cross the street ! - All right . His papers . He won 't see the bus ! - At 1 1 : ; 46 ! - All right . In the car . Stop him ! No ! - Jason ! - How did he know my name ? How the hell should I know ? [ Car Engine Starting ] Stop him ! Stop him ! You 've got to stop him ! You don 't have much time ! He 's going to die ! Stop him now ! - Stop him now ! - Lucas ! Wait ! Look , man , give me a chance ! We have got nothing left to talk about . [ Engine Accelerating ] Lucas ! Damn it ! Lucas ! Lucas ! Lucas ! No ! [ Bus Driver ] What 'd you do to him ? You pushed him . You pushed him right in front of me . You killed him ! What the hell did you do ? [ Mulder ] His name was Lucas Menand , a postdoctoral fellow at M.I.T. He 's a bright and promising researcher . A life dedicated to science cut short by an unfortunate bus accident . " Cause of death was massive head trauma , pronounced on site . " But according to the bus driver it was no accident ? He claims that Menand was pushed ... by a suspect identified as Jason Nichols , an Associate professor of Biology as well as Menand 's academic advisor . Says here in the police report they 'd been seen arguing earlier that evening , but Jason Nichols has refused to tell police about what . Hmm . Sounds like a motive , doesn 't it ? Between that and the bus driver 's statement , why am I looking at this ? Would you like to hear his alibi ? If I wanted to kill him , do you think this is how I 'd do it ? [ Detective ] Then what were you doing , Mr. Nichols ? Trying to save him ! From getting hit by the bus . I told you ! There was a man , some old guy , who said it would happen . He warned Lucas about the bus . He knew the exact time and place . He tried telling us . He knew my name . That 's his alibi ? That some old man warned him his colleague was gonna die ? Well , he goes on to tell a pretty convincing narrative ... and to give a rather detailed description of the old man . What was he wearing ? A long black robe and carrying a scythe ? - Not when campus security picked him up . - He was arrested ? Minutes before the accident , according to Jason Nichols . Packed into a security vehicle , tryin ' to warn Nichols ... even as he was being hauled away . - Has anybody talked to him ? - No . Has anybody talked to the campus security officer ? - Can 't . He 's dead . - Why not ? Of what ? Haven 't been able to make determination as to cause or time of death . There 's been some internal disagreement over how to proceed . - You mean with the autopsy ? - Yes . But mostly whether to cut or to saw . You see why we didn 't put him in refrigeration . Have you ever seen a body in such an advanced hypothermic state ? Hypothermic ? Mulder , this man 's an icicle . Did you see this ? His ear ? It looks like something 's been inserted in it . Something has . I took his temperature . I don 't know if the reading was accurate , but the thermometer said his body temp was 1 5 degrees Fahrenheit . Where was he found ? On campus inside his patrol car . parked just off Adams with one wheel on the curb . police also found an empty gin bottle under the driver 's seat . Apparently he had a history . He 'd been cited for drinking on duty . You 'd assume he passed out and froze to death ... except the low temperature for last night was 28 . And now his body temperature is eight degrees . You mean , he 's actually getting colder . Like I said , we 're a little betwixt in-between on how to go for ward here . We 'd be happy to take your lead on it . I think we 're gonna need some time ourselves . So , what 's your medical opinion , Scully ? My guess would be that he 's been exposed to some kind of chemical refrigerant ... like liquid nitrogen , possible even ingested it . Well , you see what happens when you drink and drive ? I don 't know what else to say , Mulder , except that what this doesn 't do ... is add any credence to the suspect 's alibi that the old man was on the scene . Maybe we should ask Jason Nichols if he can explain this . - What if he can 't ? - Hope he keeps until Thanksgiving . - ... eight years of work . - This is serious , Jason . This couldn 't be more serious . They 're talking about charging you with second-degree murder . I 'll call you as soon as I speak to the lawyer . - Are you from the F.B.I. ? - Yeah . Special Agent Mulder . - Is that your girl friend ? - Yeah . Thanks for seeing me . I know your attorney advised you against it . I appreciate it . I just want to talk to somebody who 's going to listen to me . Somebody who 's going to tell me they can find that old man . - There are people lookin ' for him . - Who ? The campus police ? You know that the man who allegedly detained the man you describe is dead . So , are they going to try and blame me for that one too ? Well , not unless , uh , you 're capable of killing a man by flash-freezing him . - What ? - The security officer in the morgue ... has a body temperature a little south of Frosty the Snowman . - You think that 's funny ? - Do I think what 's funny ? Coming in here and trying to screw with my head ! Does this have something to do with you and Lucas Menand ? Look , he 's the one that had been threatening me , okay ? - He threatened your life ? - My reputation . How 'd he do that ? By saying he would go public that I falsified data on my research paper . - Had you ? - No . My theory was sound . If my interpretation of certain data was a little lax , it 's because I 've been under pressure to produce results . My N.S.A. grant is up for renewal . And Lucas knew how damaging his allegations would be ! Was Lucas Menand up for the same grant ? What research would this grant have funded ? Cryobiology . I study the effects of freezing temperatures on biological systems . [ Exhales ] - [ Cellular phone Rings ] - Excuse me . - Mulder . - Has Nichols said anything ? No . I 'm right in the middle of it . I think we may be filing a second murder charge against him . - Security officer ? - I found Nichols ' print on his uniform . And forensics also matched his with the prints ... they lifted off the interior of the patrol car . I think the old man in this story is gonna be Jason Nichols ... serving 25-to-life in a federal prison . [ phone Ringing ] [ Woman On phone ] Yes . Yes . I understand . Thank you . I 'm sorry , sir . There 's nothing more we can do . My name is Yonechi . Yes , sir , you 've told me . But I 'm not finding a reservation under that name . But this is where I am supposed to stay . I 'm sorry , sir . I don 't know what else to tell you . - Dr. Yonechi ? - Yes ? Uh , there 's been a misunderstanding . I-I 'm afraid my assistant made a reservation at the wrong hotel , so I came here myself to make sure you , uh , you got a room . It 's a good room with a view of the river . You are not , uh , Dr. Nichols . He apologizes . He was not able to be here to meet you himself ... so he asked me to come in his place . Excuse me , but who are you ? A great admirer of your work . - Here we go , sir . - Thank you . - After you , sir . - No . Go ahead . [ Bellman ] If you need anything , just give us a call . Here you are , sir . Have a good evening , sir . Are you sick ? No , no . I 'm- - I 'm fine . Thank you . - May I get you some , uh , water ? - If it 's no trouble . Please . Come in . The , uh , mix-up with the reservation , it was actually my fault . - Your fault ? - But I owe you so much . - For what ? - Your contribution to my work . Vitrification . You were the one who solved the problem . - Me ? - Mmm . No . Not yet . No one has solved vitrification . Oh , yes , Yonni . You found a way to substitute water with a sugar- - trehalose . Your paper . It changed everything . I am sorry , Yonni , but this is the only way . [ Yelling ] [ Chattering ] [ Door Closing ] I just spoke with the bellman who brought up the luggage . - What did he say ? - The iceman cometh . Dr. Yonechi was accompanied by a man in his seventies . It 's a description confirmed by the desk clerk . They 're working with a composite artist on a sketch right now . - Sounds like Nichols has an accomplice . - Sounds like that . More than that , Mulder . It makes sense . Science is a high-stakes game . Nichols is trying to eliminate his competitors . - He 's succeeding . - Yeah , but what if he 's being set up ? He 's a cryobiologist . He freezes things for a living . How many can do that ? Just about anybody who 's up for that grant money could . Right . I want to show you something . This is what 's called a nuclear magnetic resonance spectra . Dr. Yonechi had a spot of blood on the heel of his hand . A pinprick . Might have been caused by a small gauge hypodermic needle . Now I found the same thing on the security officer . This is the analysis . - What is it ? - No one at the lab would even guess . But we think it 's some kind of unidentifiable chemical compound . - A lethal injection ? - You 'll have to ask Jason Nichols . No . There 's somebody I want to talk to first . - Lisa Ianelli ? - [ Gasps ] Sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . No , I was ... working . Sometimes you just get lost in it . You may remember me from this afternoon . I spoke with Jason . - From the F.B.I. - I 'm Agent Scully . - May I show you something ? - Mm-hmm . Where did you get this ? You recognize it ? Lisa , you can tell us now , or we can subpoena your testimony in court . Either way , we 'll find out what you know about it . It 's a kind of catalyst . - A catalyst for what ? - A self-sustaining endothermic reaction . It 's a rapid freezing agent . Something Jason 's been engineering for years . See , when a cell freezes , its moisture forms into ice crystals , which literally grind up the cell from the inside out . But extreme rapid freezing causes a smoother , glass-like structure to form , so the cell can survive being thawed , at least according to Jason 's theory . This compound , has Jason actually tested it yet ? He hasn 't tested it yet because it doesn 't exist , except in the computer . So far the work 's been limited to generating virtual chemicals , like this . In fact , what we 're looking there is a version of the catalyst you brought me . Is it possible he could have synthesized the compound without you knowing it ? Not even remotely . Technology to engineer something like that is still five , ten years away . - Not anymore , apparently . - What are you talking about ? Traces of the compound were detected in a man who was found dead last night . Frozen solid . Then there must be some kind of mistake . And a , uh , Dr. Yonechi was also found frozen to death . - What ? - In his heated hotel room . - When was this ? - Just over two hours ago . Why ? Because he may not be dead . What 's his temp ? His core temperature 's up to 97 . Okay . Let 's take him out . And then what ? We 've got to try to resuscitate him . Let 's go . [ Doctor ] All right . On my count . One . Two . Three . - This isn 't gonna work . - Why not ? His body temperature was eight degrees . The lowest reported body temperature ever survived by a human being was 70 . Well , if he 's already dead , then he 's got nothin ' to lose . - [ Doctor ] Okay . We 're hooked up here . - [ Electronic Buzzing ] All right , Dr. Ianelli , we 're gonna start with 300 joules and an amp of epi . [ Nurse ] Entracardial epi ready . [ Indistinct ] Charging . - Clear ? - [ Nurse ] Clear . - Still no pulse . - [ Doctor ] Go to360 . - Clear . - [ Nurse ] Clear . No response . Give him another amp of entracardial epi and atropine , one milligram . Tryagainat360 . - [ Nurse ] Clear . - [ Doctor ] Clear . [ Electronic Beeping ] He 's got a rhythm . [ Lisa ] Dr. Yonechi ? You 're in a prototype frostbite bay in Cambridge , Mass . You 've been unconscious for almost 1 2 hours . [ Moaning ] - Dr. Yonechi ? My name is Lisa Ianelli . - [ Moaning Continues ] Don 't try and talk right now . We 've inserted a tube to help you breathe . Try not to fight the machine . Let it breathe for you . [ Beeping Continues ] [ Gasping , Groaning ] - Something 's wrong . - [ Yonechi Screaming ] Scully , look at his temperature . Oh , my God . He 's on fire . - He 's having febrile seizures . - This can 't be right . He 's burning up . Hold him down . Hold him down ! - [ All Screaming ] - [ Alarm Ringing ] [ Screaming ] [ Woman ] We were trying to resuscitate him- - [ Chattering ] [ Fireman ] Okay . He seemed to be all right though . Lisa , what happened ? I mean , what- - what could 've happened to create such a violent cellular reaction ? I don 't know . All I can think is the compound used to freeze him must have been unstable . So raising his body temperature may have ... catalyzed an opposite reaction , heating him internally ? Mm-hmm . I question now if we should have removed him from the tub . I think we might have saved him . I think the real question is how somebody could have had access ... to a compound that doesn 't exist . I 'm sorry . I need to talk to Jason . Excuse me . [ Chattering ] [ Brakes Screeching ] Watch it ! Who are you ? I said who are you ? What do you want ? Why are you following me ? Unless I 'm mistaken , you 're the one following me . - I saw you outside . - You 're confusing me with someone else . You 're the man Jason saw , aren 't you ? You killed Lucas Menand and Dr. Yonechi . - And I can kill you . - Let go of me ! I came here ... to kill you . Who are you ? [ Mulder ] You say he followed you off the bus ? Yes . I noticed him just before my stop . - And you were on your way to see Jason ? - Yes . I confronted him inside the library . He followed me in there . And then he grabbed me and hurt my arm . What did he say ? That he could kill me . That that 's why he was following me . He threatened me with some kind of medical instrument . But he just let you go ? Lisa , if you 're leaving anything out , if you 're hedging the truth , you could be held accountable if Jason committed a crime . It wasn 't Jason . It was me . I falsified the data to get the grant . Jason 's covering for me . - He 's in jail because of me . - That 's what he can 't tell anyone ? [ Scully ] But there are people who could 've figured it out . Lucas Menand , Dr. Yonechi . These people are now dead . No , it 's not what you think . - You know this old man , don 't you ? - I don 't . I swear to you . But Jason does . This man is doing what Jason can 't- - protecting your secret . He swore to me he would never confess it to a soul . If he 'd lie for you , what makes you think he wouldn 't lie to you ? Scully ? It doesn 't make sense . Why threaten her if she 's protecting his secret ? Because it 's not just her secret . It 's Jason 's secret too . And the old man is protecting Jason . - With a medical instrument ? - [ Exhales ] I suppose it is an unlikely choice as a murder weapon . Well , what if it 's not a murder weapon ? I 'm just speculating . But what if it was designed for some other purpose ? Agent Mulder ? We 've been canvassing the area . Hotel manager from a couple blocks away thinks he 's made your guy . It 's on McKinney Street . Hotel 's called the Lighthouse . Tell the unit to keep watch until we get there . Make sure she gets home safe . - [ Knocking ] - Federal agents , sir . Open the door . [ Scully ] Are you sure this is the room ? The hotel manager says he 's been living here for five days . I 'm not sure if " Living " is the word I 'd use on this place . Yonechi 's flight information was taken down on this pad . Hey , look at this . When was this taken ? What 's the occasion ? A celebration . But of what ? Of something that never happened . What ? Mulder , this is a photograph . It is a documented moment in time . In a future that somebody 's trying like hell to prevent from happening . - What ? - Think about it , Scully . If Lucas Menand never gets hit by that bus , his complaint gets heard before the grant committee . Jason Nichols loses his funding . He never gets to collaborate on his research with Dr. Yonechi . This photograph never gets taken because this celebration never happens . And if your sister is your aunt and your mother marries your uncle , you 'd be your own grandpa . The old man couldn 't save Lucas Menand , so he had to kill Dr. Yonechi . Okay . So this photo that was never taken , when was it never taken ? At least five years in the future , when they first synthesized ... the freezing compound successfully . Let 's take the stairs . Mulder , the compound already exists . We have physical evidence . Only because the old man brought it back with him . - Back from where ? - From when may be the real question . You 're seriously suggesting that this old man is back from the future ? Unless you have a better explanation for how he knew exactly ... when and how Lucas Menand was gonna be killed ; why Jason Nichols ' fingerprints were inside that patrol car ; and how he knew Lisa Ianelli 's secret . - What you 're saying is the old man is- - - Jason Nichols . Although , common sense may rule out the possibility of time travel , the laws of quantum physics certainly do not . In case you forgot , that 's from your graduate thesis . You were a lot more open-minded when you were a youngster . I know what I wrote , Mulder . I also know that the laws of physics ... would permit the theoretical possibility of time travel , but the limits of human endurance would prevent such a trip from ever happening . - One way to prove that possibility . - How ? Show this photo to Lisa Ianelli and ask her if it was ever taken . [ Exhales ] [ Groaning ] [ Breathing Heavily ] Jason ? I don 't understand . How is this possible ? Because you made it possible . It was you . How ? I need to know . Thirty years ago , ten years from now , you 'll be at a conference in Zurich . You 'll meet a man named McGuane who 's just discovered ... the first evidence of tachyons- - subatomic particles that can travel faster than the speed of light ... and go back in time , but only for a few seconds ... and only at a temperature of absolute zero . But from that and from your correspondence with McGuane , you 'll have an idea , a revelation . What revelation ? One so remarkable ... it would change the course of history . Then why did you- - You said you came back to kill me . But I couldn 't do it . You 're cold . Jason ? Yes . [ Gasps ] [ Moaning , Whimpering ] [ Man ] Sign here . Jason ? - What are you doing here ? - I 've arranged for your bail . - I assumed it was Lisa . - No . Something 's happened to her . What are you talking about ? I think it 's something you should see for yourself . She 's at the medical research facility . - Was it the old man ? - Yes . Why haven 't you found him yet ? Who the hell is he ? Look , Jason , I-I don 't expect you to get your mind around this right now . What ? The man we 're looking for , the old man , he 's you . [ Car Horn Honking ] That photo is indicative of a pattern . You may be his next target . It puts a whole new spin on being your own worst enemy . Except that I 've never met Dr. Yonechi and neither has Lisa . So this must have been altered somehow . Not according to the photo specialist that I had examine it . As far as she could tell , it 's the real McCoy . Then maybe you should get a second opinion ... because I 'm not buying your story . - Jason , it 's your story . - It 's science fiction . So is your rapid freezing agent , until two days ago . So , why don 't you just consider the evidence as a scientist . How could the old man come to possess a compound that you admit doesn 't exist ? Whoever he is , why would he be trying to prevent my compound from being developed ? - I 'm not sure of that yet . - But you have a theory . I think it has something to do with the practical application of your compound , though I don 't know what that is yet . Involving time travel ? Physicists like Stephen Hawking have hypothesized ... the existence of worm holes and closed time loops , actual portals through which matter can travel backward through time . Although phenomena like extreme heat and gravity ... would render the trip lethal for any organism . So , you 're saying the properties of my compound will make it possible ? Eventually , yes . That 's what I 'm saying . But why stop time travel ? That 's what I 'm hoping the old man can tell us . Agent Mulder , if any of this is true , then what happened to Lisa ... is really my fault . - We 're going up to the Cryo Lab . - Mm-hmm . Hey , wait a sec . - Are you Dr.Jason Nichols ? - That 's right . Then , something 's wrong . - [ Computer Keys Clicking ] - It says you 're already in the building . Listen to me , Jason . I need you to get to Scully and tell her that he 's here . She 's in the frostbite bay with Lisa . Can you do that ? All right . - [ Doctor ] Clear . - [ Nurse # 1 ] Clear . [ Electronic Buzzing ] Let 's give her another amp of epinephrine and we 'll go again at 360 . [ Nurse # 1 ] Charging . Epi given . - Clear . - [ Nurse # 2 ] Everybody clear . - [ Electronic Beeping ] - [ Doctor ] Increase the DMSO . - We have a rhythm . Now what ? - [ Nurse # 1 ] pulse . Get her back in the tub . - Now . - Let 's disconnect and get her back in . - [ Nurse # 2 ] Here we go . - [ Doctor ] Let 's go . - [ Beeping Continues ] - [ Nurse # 1 ] All right . Here we are . - Easy . - [ Scully ] How high 's the reading now ? [ Nurse # 1 ] 106 . 107 . [ Computer Keys Clicking ] - Is there a problem ? - Anybody been here in the last hour ? Well , there was a maintenance guy who fixed the fan , but other than that , it 's just been me . No , I 'm lookin ' for an older man , a man in his mid-seventies maybe ? I haven 't seen anybody like that . Why ? Does this have something to do with Dr. Nichols ? - Do you work with him ? - I 'm one of his research assistants . - You have access to his files ? - Yeah . I 'd like to pull up some information about his rapid freezing compound . [ Cellular phone Rings ] - Mulder . - We 've resuscitated her , Mulder . Her body temperature 's still high , but it seems to have stabilized . - Well , did Jason help ? - He 's not here . All right . He should 've been there five minutes ago , Scully . - Where are you ? - Oh , this is crazy . - Mulder ? - Uh , let me get back to you , Scully . What ? It 's Dr. Nichols ' files . They 're totally whacked . - What do you mean " whacked " ? - His data . It 's gone . It 's like somebody 's completely erased it from the mainframe . I knew I 'd find you here . I figured this is where I 'd go to stop myself . I don 't have much time . Please . Let me finish . Let you finish destroying my work ? It 's my work too . - I want her back . - I know . Then tell me how to go back so I can save her . Please . I don 't expect you to understand . - Understand what ? - What she created , what you- - we helped to create . A world without history , without hope , where anyone can know everything that will ever happen . I 've seen that world . - Tell me how to go back . - I can 't . You will ! - Tell me ! - No ! - Jason ! Try to understand ! - Jason ! Tell me how to go back so I can save her ! Jason ! She 's alive ! Lisa 's alive ! Don 't hurt him ! If you hurt him , we 'll never know the truth ! Open the door . She 's okay . - It 's better that we never were . - No ! [ Screaming ] Lisa ? It 's Dana Scully . Can you hear me ? You 're going to be fine . We knew to keep you submerged in order to maintain your body temperature . After what happened to Dr. Yonechi , your theory about the compound 's instability , well , you proved it yourself . [ Whispering ] He said- - He said he was Jason . The old man ? Look , there 's been some incongruous evidence ... I 've had difficulty explaining myself . It was him ... Agent Scully . He was Jason . Lisa , Jason 's dead . There was a fire in the mainframe room . I 'm sorry . I 'll see you at the hospital . [ Ambulance Engine Starting ] - Did they find the second corpse ? - No . And I 'm not holding out much hope that they will either . - We should put an A.P.B. on the old man . - We won 't find him . I know what I saw , Scully , and I know what I believe happened . - Even if it can never be proven ? - Never ? Never is a very long time . You said that yourself . Although multidimensionality suggests infinite outcomes ... and an infinite number of universes , each universe can produce only one outcome . I was 23 when I wrote that . But I take that you were suggesting that the future can 't be altered , which means the elder Nichols ' attempts to stop his own research will fail , and that eventually his compound and time travel will be discovered .

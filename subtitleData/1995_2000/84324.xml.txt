 Claire ... I miss you . Dr Weir , report to the Lewis Clark in Docking Bay four . - lon drive set . - Thank you . Heading : vector one-nine degrees . We are prepped for lockdown . I can 't believe this . It 's ridiculous . I haven 't got more than my hand in weeks , and now this shit . Why can 't we go to Mars , Captain ? I mean , Mars has ... has got women . Smith 's right . Neptune ... there 's nothing out there . Yeah , we 'll be on our own . That 's the rules . They drop the ball , we get the call . Have you got our course plotted ? Locked and cocked . Mr Justin ? Everything 's green on my screen , Skipper . - Start countdown . - lon drive in 10 minutes . Thank you , Lieutenant . Let 's go . - Smith , follow me . - Yes , ma 'am . Justin , prep those tanks . Yes , sir . Mr Cooper. lon drive in 10 minutes . Ooh , time to play " spam-in-the-can " . - Skipper ! - Peters . Captain Miller , I just wanted to say that ... The clock is ticking , Doctor . Waiting for a personal invitation , Mr Smith ? - No , sir ! - Captain , I don 't ... Follow the crew to the grav tanks . We 're almost under way . Square away that bunk , Mr Cooper , or you 're walking to Neptune . What 's the hold-up , Peters ? Loading the CO2 scrubbers , sir . You stand right here . Thanks , DJ . Hats off . - First time in a grav couch ? - Yeah . I think your captain has a problem with me . Oh , well , don 't worry about him . He just loves having complete strangers on his ship . DJ ! Yeah ! Nah . Is this necessary ? When the ion drive fires you 'll be taking about 30 Gs . Without a tank , the force would liquefy your skeleton . I 've seen the effect on mice . Claustrophobic ? Very . Billy . I 'm so alone . Hello ? Is anyone there ? Billy ? I 'm so cold . Claire . I 'm waiting . You 're all right . Breathe . DJ ! OK , Dr Weir . Let 's get you up . Come on . I 'm fine ! OK . There you go . Move nice and slow . You 've been in stasis for 56 days . You 're a little disorientated . Understand ? I 'm all right . Thank you . OK . Take that . Don 't rush it . All yours . You OK , Doc ? Want some coffee ? What ? Would you like some coffee ? No . Thank you . All right . Suit yourself . What about you , Starck ? Want something hot and black ? - Is that an offer ? - No . Then how about some coffee ? - Starck ? - Yes , sir . Why aren 't you on the bridge ? - Mind if I get dressed ? - Yes . Let 's go , people ! OK , Denny , here we go . Happy birthday . Play horsey , Mommy ! Play horsey ! Oh ! Oh ! Hey ! No balls indoors . - Yo , apologise . - Sorry , Mama Bear . - Peters ? - Yes , sir . I did try to find a replacement for you , but it was impossible . I am sorry . I talked to my ex . He 's going to take Denny for Christmas . I 'll get him for the summer , so everything 's all right . Smitty ! Excuse me , ladies and gentlemen . In approximately 2 hours and 23 minutes , we 'll be arriving at Neptune . I thank you . Good . Everything 's five by five . - USAC notified of our position ? - Yes , sir . All right , people , listen up . We have an addition to our crew . Dr Weir , care to join us ? Introductions all around . This is my XO ... Lieutenant Starck . Mr Justin , Engineering . The funky spaceman is Mr Cooper . What do you do here , Coop ? Doc . I 'm your best friend . Life-saver and heartbreaker . He 's a rescue technician . This is Peters , medical technician . And my pilot ... Mr Smith . The gloomy Gus in the corner over there , that 's , uh ... DJ Trauma . All right . All right . Now , then , I got a question . What the fuck are we doing here ? Perhaps the good doctor will tell us . Thank you . Uh , I want to say how much I appreciate this opportunity ... Yes . You appreciate being here , Doctor , but understand - we don 't . We were taken off leave and sent into Neptune space . We are three billion clicks from the nearest outpost . The last time USAC attempted a rescue this far out ... we lost both ships . So if you please ... Right . Well , everything I 'm about to tell you is considered code black by the NSA . USAC intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune . The source of this transmission has been identified as the Event Horizon . Yeah . Well , that 's bullshit , for starters . I lost leave for this ? Thank you so much ! Smitty , sit down . Cooper , as you were . Just let the man speak . What was made public about the Event Horizon ... that she was a research vessel , that her reactor went critical , and she blew up ... none of that is true . The Event Horizon was a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster-than-light flight . Uh , excuse me . You can 't actually do that . The law of relativity prohibits it . Relativity , yes . We can 't break the law of relativity , but we can go around it . The ship doesn 't really go faster than light . It creates a gateway to jump instantaneously from one point to another light years away . How ? Well , that 's difficult to ... it 's all math . Try us , Doctor . Right . Well , uh , using layman 's terms ... we use a retaining magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons . These , in turn , fold space-time until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you produce a singularity . Now , the singularity ... Layman 's terms . Well , fuck layman 's terms . Do you speak English ? Imagine for a minute that this piece of paper ... Uh , excuse me . That 's Vanessa , and that 's mine . This piece of paper represents space-time , and you want to get from " A " here ... to " B " there . Now , what 's the shortest distance between two points ? A straight line . Wrong . The shortest distance between two points is zero , and that 's what the gateway does ... it folds ... space so that point " A " and point " B " coexist in the same space and time . When the spacecraft passes through the gateway , space returns to normal . It 's called a gravity drive . How do you know all this ? I built it . Well , I see why they sent you . So if the ship didn 't blow up , then what happened ? Well ... the mission was going perfectly , they reached safe distance using conventional thrusters , they had the go-ahead to use the gravity drive to open the gateway to Proxima Centauri , and then , they just disappeared , vanished without a trace . Until now . Where has she been , Doctor ? That 's what we 're here to find out . We 've been unable to verify life contact . The TDRS did receive this single transmission . - What the fucking hell is that ? - Listen to this . Houston passed the recording through several filters and managed to isolate what appears to be a human voice . - I 'm not sure it is language . - Latin . - What ? - I mean , I think ... Well , it sounds like Latin . - Can you translate it ? - Play it again . Right there . You hear that ? Sounds like " liberate me " something or other . I can 't make out the rest . " Liberate me " ? " Save me . " All right . Stations , people . Crossing the horizon . Optimum approach angle is 14 degrees . Come around to 3-3-4 . 3-3-4 . Make your approach vector negative 14 degrees . 1-4 degrees . Locked on Event Horizon 's navigation beacon . She 's in the upper ionosphere , and it looks like we 're in for some heavy chop ! - Bring us in tight . - Yes , sir . - Mr Justin , how 's my ship ? - Smooth sailing , sir . Matching speed on my mark . Three , two , one , mark ! - Range ? - 10,000 metres , sir . Check radio . See if anybody 's listening . This is the USAC Lewis Clark hailing Event Horizon . Event Horizon , do you read ? Dr Weir ! I think you 'll want to see this . - Where is she ? - Dead ahead , 5,000 metres ! - Starck ? - Event Horizon , do you read ? 3,000 metres and closing ! - Can 't see anything ! - 1,500 metres , sir . Too close . - Where is it ? - Right in front ! - 1,000 metres . - Proximity warning ! 900 ! 800 ! 700 ! - We 're gonna hit ! - Starck ! God ! Reverse thrusters ! Full ! There she is . Jesus . Very impressive ship , Doctor . Thank you . Mr Smith , are you up for a flyby ? Yes , sir . Yes , sir . I 'd love to . That 's the main airlock , we can dock in there . All right . Smith , use the arm and lock us onto that antenna cluster . Go carefully here . That 's not a load-bearing structure . It is now , Doctor . Everything five by five ? Locked into the Event Horizon . Light ' em if you got ' em . Thank you very much , sir . Starck , give me a read . The reactor 's still hot . We 've got several small radiation sources , but they 're leaks , nothing serious . Pressure ? The hull 's intact , but there 's no gravity , and thermal units are off-line . The crew couldn 't survive unless they were in stasis . - Find them , Starck . - Already on it , Captain . Bio-scan on-line . There 's something wrong with the scan . - Radiation interference ? - Not enough . I 'm picking up life forms but I can 't get a lock . These readings don 't make sense . OK . We do it the hard way ... room by room . Starck , deploy the umbilicus . - Smitty , fire up the War Room . - Sir . Mr Justin , you 're up for a walk ? Yes , sir . Doctor , I 'll need you here . Captain ... I need to be on that ship . Once it 's secured , we 'll bring you on board ... That 's unacceptable . I need to be ... Once we 've secured the ship . I need you to guide us . Help us do our job . Oh , oh , honey , honey , honey . You forgot your briefcase . Stand clear ! Anything gets funky , Cooper ... I 'll be on it ! Yo , Baby Bear ... keep your nose clean . DJ , showtime . Video feed is clear . Are you with us , Dr Weir ? Yes , I 'm with you . We are crossing the umbilicus , making our approach to the Event Horizon . You 're at the outer airlock door . Magnetic boots on . We 've got pressure . Place is a deep-freeze . We got ice crystals everywhere . That 's the central corridor that you 're in . It connects the front of the ship to Engineering at the rear . Mr Justin , take Engineering . Yes , sir . Peters and I will take the forward decks . Doctor , what are these ? Yeah . I 've got another one over here . In an emergency , they destroy the central corridor and split the ship in half , and then the crew can use the foredecks as a lifeboat . I 'm in Medical . No casualties . Place looks like it 's never been used . You haven 't seen any crew ? If we saw any crew , Doctor , you 'd know it . Scanning for life readings . This place is a tomb . Oh , fuck me ! Miller . Miller , are you OK ? Skipper 's got a case of the willies . Cooper , back to your post . Miller , your heart rate just rocketed . I 'm fine . I think I 've reached the door to the first containment , Dr Weir . The engineering decks are on the other side . OK . Let 's take a look . What the hell is this place , Dr Weir ? It 's to enter the second containment without compromising the magnetic fields . Looks like a meat grinder to me . I 'm on the bridge . Got some blood here . There must have been a coolant leak . Man , this shit is everywhere . Coolant levels on reserve but well within the safety line . Ms Peters , could you turn back and left ? - What is it ? - Ship 's log . It 's stuck . It 's pretty jammed in there . What the hell happened to his eyes ? Explosive decompression . Decompression doesn 't do that . Looks like it was caused by ... I don 't know , an animal . Look at the soft tissue , the massive abrasions . Corpse-cicle . I 'm scanning for life forms . Man , I 'm getting some really strange readings in here . Let me see if I can get some power up . That 's the core , the gravity drive ... The heart of the ship . Justin ? Justin , you 're breaking up ! Justin , come in ! - What 's up ? - The life scan lit up . Something 's wrong . Pull him out . Oh , shit ! He 's in trouble ! - Go , Coop ! - I 'm gone ! Boarding party , sound off . This is Miller . Can anybody hear me ? What the fuck was that ? Pressure emergency ! We 've lost the starboard baffle ! The hull 's been breached ! I 'll contain it as long as I can ! Get out ! We 're losing atmosphere ! There are pressure suits in the airlock . Go ! Here I come ! Hold on , Baby Bear ! I 'm almost there , almost there ! I got you ! I got you ! Oh ! Watch out ! Watch ! I got you . What the fuck is this ? Hold on ! Captain Miller ! Do you copy ? Over ! Smitty , where you been ? We have a situation , sir ! We 've lost the starboard baffle , and the hull 's been breached ! The safety circuits have failed ! Time for a weld ? No , sir ! We 've got 218 litres of gas , and then we 've got nothing ! The oxygen tanks failed . Sir , we are fucking dead ! What about the Event Horizon ? What ? She 's got air and power ! It 's our only chance ! There 's no way I 'm getting on that bastard ! It beats dying , Mr Smith . I want all personnel on board the Event Horizon pronto . - Meet at the air tanks . - I 'm ahead of you , sir . Bringing thermal units on-line . Hold tight . Prep for Gs . Gravity in five seconds . Wake up ! Open your eyes , all right ? Dr Weir . Well , I brought most primary systems on-line ... for now . Thank you . Starck , what 's our status ? The antenna array is completely fried . We 've got no radio , no laser , no high gain . No one 's coming to help . - This air tastes bad . - Yeah . Carbon dioxide . And the CO2 filters here are shot . Take the Clark 's . That gives us ... what ? Enough breathable air for 20 hours , but after that , we 'd better be going . I 'm on the port side , approaching the dorsal heat sink . Holy shit . Captain Miller , do you copy ? Smith . How 's my ship ? Sir , we 've got a seven-metre fracture . We can repair her , but it 'll take a long time . Negative . 20 hours , we suffocate . Understood , sir . What happened here , Doctor ? OK . How is he ? His vital signs seem stable , but he 's unresponsive to stimuli . I don 't know . He might wake up in 15 minutes . He might not wake up ever . Skipper , this sounds weird , but , I mean , there was , like , nothing , and then Justin appeared , and , um , there was liquid , and the whole core just turned solid . It 's just not physically possible . Doctor , please , don 't start in with that physics shit . I 'm telling you , I saw it . It would mean the gateway was open . Then the gateway was open . It couldn 't be because the gravity drive wasn 't activated . I 'm telling you what I saw ... It can 't start by itself ! Mr Cooper , you are out of line ! Doctor , Mr Justin may die . Now , whatever happened to him could happen to all of us . Mr Cooper says he saw something . I believe he saw something . I need an explanation . Well , in my view , Mr Cooper 's delusional ... but maybe he saw an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion . An optical effect ! That 's fucking poetic . I 'm sorry . I 'm all right . OK . Gravitational distortion ... what could create that , Doctor ? If , somehow , a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core , it could distort space-time . It could make Justin seem to disappear . It could also have damaged the Lewis Clark . However , I think this is entirely unlikely . What 's in the core , Doctor ? It 's complicated . Well , how much time do you need ? We have ... 17 hours and 48 minutes . What 's in the core ? This is the gateway . Now , these three magnetic rings , when they align , it creates an artificial black hole , which allows the ship to travel to any point in space . A black hole , the most destructive force in the universe ... and you 've created one ? Absolutely . Yes . Because we can use that immense power to bend space-time . Look , it would take the Lewis Clark a thousand years to reach our nearest star , but the Event Horizon could be there in a day . - If it worked . - Come down . It 's quite safe . So if Justin was sucked through , he 's been wherever the Event Horizon 's been . Theoretically , yes , but I told you , the gateway can 't just open . I see . I want this room sealed off . Second containment is off limits . Yes , sir . Captain , there 's no danger . The gateway 's contained . It 's perfectly safe . Safe ? ! Doctor , my ship is in pieces , and one of my crewmen almost died . No one else goes near this . Come on . There 's got to be something on this log . You can do this . DJ , where are you ? I 'm up on Deck 4 . Mommy . What is it ? You all right ? What 's up ? You was out there so long . I 'd rather spend 12 hours outside than another five seconds in here . It 's the final entry in the ship 's log . I 'm very proud of my crew . I 'd like to name my station heads : Chris Chambers , Janice Reuben , Ben Fender , Dick Smith . We 've reached safe distance ... That 's John Kilpack , ship 's captain . .. we 're preparing to engage the gravity drive and open the gateway to Proxima Centauri . " Ave atque vale . " Hail and farewell . What is that ? I 'll see if I can clean it up . It 's a power drain . It 's the core . Stay here . I don 't want anybody else near that thing . Wait for me , Doctor ! What 's causing the drain ? Magnetic fields are holding . There may be a short in the fail-safe circuit . Can you give us a hand ? Justin ! Justin , can you hear me ? - He 's coming ! - Who 's coming ? The dark . Yeah . That 's the one . Captain Miller , I 've got some problems here ! Be with me ... forever . Carbon dioxide can produce hallucinations , impair judgement . Goddamit , it was not a hallucination . Doctor , you were in the duct . You must have heard something . You must have seen something . I did . About an hour ago , I saw my son lying on the examination table . and ... in his legs were crawling ... Ms Peters , it sounds a little like shock . You 're traumatised ... No . No . Excuse me ! No ! I 've seen bodies before . This was different . She 's right . This ... this was real . I felt ... I felt heat . This is not something that 's in our heads . Smitty , have you seen anything unusual at all ? No , I haven 't seen anything , and I don 't need to see anything , sir , but this ship is fucked . Well , thank you , Mr Smith . Yeah , you don 't ... OK , OK ! All right , Doc . Breaking the laws of physics costs ! You killed the last crew , now us ! It 's just a fucking ship . It 's just a ship , a hunk of metal . There 's nothing odd going on . Fine . OK . Let 's see this . You all right ? Yeah . I 'm just ... I 'm sorry . There 's no fucking chance ... That 's enough ! I want you cool ! Now ! All right . You 're going outside on the Clark with Cooper and you 're going to repair the ship . No mistakes . Mistakes , nobody goes home . Understood ? Yes , sir . All right . Get moving . Miller . What , Starck ? I ran the bio-scan . The results were bioreadings ... Of an indeterminate origin . Yes . Tell me something useful , Lieutenant . - I 've got a theory . - Let 's hear it . There 's a connection between the readings and the hallucinations , like part of a defensive reaction , an immune system . I don 't have time ... - Listen . - To what ? This ship is reacting , and the reactions are getting stronger . As if the ship brought back something with it . What are you telling me ? That this ship is alive ? You wanted an answer . I want to survive the next 10 hours . Did you hear that ? ! You heard it . What is it ? Listen to me . It 's DJ , all right ? Neither of us heard anything . Just calm down . Get your breath back . - Now , tell me . - I was ... Make it stop ! Open the door . No ! Weir , stop ! Stop him ! What are you doing ? ! In our current environment , self-control is an asset . What is it ? Um ... the forward airlock . Miller , Smith , Cooper , anyone in the airlock ? That 's a negative , Starck . Justin , no ! Justin , open the door ! Miller , come in . Miller , come in . We have an emergency . What 's going on , Starck ? Justin 's in the airlock . Say again . Justin 's in the airlock without a suit . - I 'm on it . - No , sailor . - Skipper , you need me . - Stay there . - He 's engaged the override . - Shut it down . - I 'll try . - Coming to him , Starck . Justin ! Open this door now ! Starck , give me status . He 's engaged the override . We can 't open the door . - I 'll get the kit . - Justin , open the door ! Justin , open the door . Did you hear it ? - Keep him talking . - Yes , I heard it . What is it ? It shows you things ... horrible things . What does ? The dark inside me ... from the other place . - I won 't go back there . - Baby Bear , open the door ! - What 's happening ? - He won 't listen . If he opens the airlock he 'll turn inside out . - Stay with me ! - Almost got it ... Stay with me , Justin ! Open that door ! If you could see what I 've seen , you wouldn 't stop me . That 's not you talking ! That 's not you talking . That 's it , there . Open the door . Go for that button . He 's activated the door . It 's on a 30-second delay . Stand by for decompression in 25 seconds . Where am I ? Hey ... - Open it ! - Open the door ... I can 't . It won 't open when the outside door 's triggered . - Oh , God . - Mama Bear ... open the door . Come on . Please ... - Captain ! - Patch me through . - Tell them to open it . - I can 't , Justin . - I don 't want to die . - You 're not gonna die . Listen , I 'll get you out . Oh , my God . It 's starting . My eyes ! Don 't think about them . Shut them as tight as you can . Five seconds . Tuck yourself into a ball . I can 't breathe ! Oh ! Oh , God ! Oh , God , it hurts ! I want you to huff and puff and empty your lungs . Do you hear me , Justin ? ! Do it ! Now ! OK , Baby Bear . Got him . I got him . Stand by , people . Stand by ! We 've got pressure . We 're coming , Justin ! We 're coming ! We 're going to need five units here . Hold his head still . Give me some more glycerine now ! - One thing at a time . - Christ , he 's bleeding ! I stopped the bleeding . Stabilised him best I can . He won 't be pretty , but he should live ... if we get back . We 'll make it . Starck , what 's our time like ? CO2 levels will become toxic in four hours . All right . Peters , we 've got to find out what happened to the other crew before it happens to us . I can work on the bridge , but I won 't go back to Medical . - Fine . - Yes , sir . Justin said something about ... " the dark inside me . " What 's that mean ? Doctor ? I - I don 't think it means anything . Don 't you walk away from me , mister . I 'd like some answers , Doctor . Why did one of my men try to commit suicide ? I 'd like to know what caused that noise . Look , thermal changes in the hull could have caused it to expand and contract , causing reverberations . It 's possible . Bullshit ! You built this ship . You 've given me nothing but bullshit . What do you to hear ? You said the ship 's drive creates a gateway . Yeah . To what ? I don 't know . Where did you send it ? I don 't know . Where has it been for seven years ? - I don 't know . - That 's not good enough . You 're the expert . I need answers . That 's your job . Now , the other place , where is that ? I don 't know ! I don 't know ! Look , there 's a lot of things happening around here that I don 't fully understand . I need time . I see . Well , that 's exactly what we don 't have , Doctor . Captain ! Don 't leave me ! Don 't leave me ! Please ! For God 's sakes , help me ! It 's in your head . It 's just in your head . God help us . I 'm telling you , it was his voice I heard . He was calling to me ... a young bosun named Eddie Corrick . We served on the Goliath together . When the O2 tanks ruptured , four of us made it to the lifeboat , but Corrick was still on board when the fire broke out . You ever seen fire in zero gravity ? It 's beautiful . It 's like liquid . It slides all over everything . Comes up in waves . And they just kept hitting him , wave after wave . He was screaming for me to save him . What did you do ? I did the only thing I could . I closed the lifeboat hatch , and I left him behind . I swore I 'd never lose another man . I 've known you a long time . You never told me that . That 's just it , DJ . I never told anybody . But this ship knew about it . It knows my fears . It knows my secrets . Gets inside your head , and it shows you . I wasn 't going to tell you this . I 've been listening to the distress signal , and I , um ... think I made a mistake in the translation . Liberate tutemet ... Go on . I thought it said " liberate me " ... " Save me . " But it 's not " me . " It 's " liberate tutemet " ... " Save yourself . " And it gets worse . Liberate tutemet ex inferis . There . I think ... That says " ex inferis . " " Save yourself ... " from hell . " Look , if what Dr Weir tells us is true , this ship has been beyond the boundaries of our universe , of known scientific reality . Who knows where it 's been , what it 's seen ... and what it 's brought back with it ? From hell . You don 't believe in that stuff , do you ? Whoever sent that message , he sure believes in hell . Captain Miller ! It better be good , Coop . Ready to repressurise the Clark and get out of here . On my way . Come on , baby . Don 't let me down . Hello , baby . Papa 's home . She 's holding . Oh , shit . Skipper , we 're still venting trace gasses . Give me 20 minutes to plug it . Cooper , you are the life-saver . 20 minutes and we 're under way . Shit . Got any coffee ? Yeah , but it 's cold . Great . Liberate tutemet ex inferis . We 're leaving . No , we can 't leave . Our orders are specific . Rescue the crew , salvage the ship . They 're dead , Doctor . Your ship killed them . - We came to do a job . - We 're aborting ! Starck , download the files from the Event Horizon 's computers . DJ , get Justin prepped and ready to move to the Clark . There 's stuff I want from Medical . - Move him to the tank . - No problem . Do it . - Peters . - Yes , sir . Get the CO2 scrubbers . Take Smitty with you . Don 't do this . It 's done . You can 't leave my ship ! I have no intention of leaving her . I will take the Lewis Clark and launch TAC missiles at the Event Horizon . No . Captain , bio-scans just went off the scale . The core 's draining power from the rest of the ship . Get the files . Vacate . I want off this ship . You can 't leave . She won 't let you . Just get your gear or you 're walking home . I am home . Let 's go ! Ready ? Shot . Come on . Come on . Ready ? Shot . Shot . OK . Can we go ? This place freaks me out . - You wanna breathe going home ? - No ! Let 's go ! Shit ! 25 ! Come on ! We need 25 ! Peters ! Come out ! Got it ! Oh , no , Peters . Oh , God . It 's me . I 'm home . I 'm home . I know I wasn 't there when you needed me , and ... I 'm sorry I ... I let my work come between us . God , Claire , no . I 'm begging you . Please , please don 't . Not again , please . I 've been so ... I 've been so ... Billy . It 's all right . I 've been so alone . You 'll never be alone again . You 're with me now . You 're with me , and I have such wonderful , wonderful things ... to show you . Damn , I 'm good ! Coop , how long are you going to take ? You can kiss my ass , Smith . I 'm done . Just let me collect my tools , and we can go . - Two minutes , tops . - Roger that . Dr Weir , get your ass back on board now ! Weir ! Shit . Captain Miller , do you copy ? Over . Go ahead , Smitty . I 've just seen Weir messing around on the Clark , sir . Stand by , Smitty . I wanna check something out . - Smith , get out . - Come again , sir ? Explosives are missing . Weir 's put it on Clark . No , sir . No way . I 've just put it back together . Get off there , Smith ! Where the fuck are you ? Got you . Hang on , Smitty ! I 'm coming ! No ! Shit ! Shit ! Where the fuck am I going ? Why does this shit happen to me ? Fuck . All right , think , Coop . Think . Think ! Get back to the ship . Blow my air tank . I 'll blow my air tank . All right . Fuck . Oh , this better work . This shit better work . Here I go . One , two , three . Come on . Come on ! Come on ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Here I come , motherfuckers ! What was that ? Clark 's gone . Smitty and Cooper are dead . What the ... ? You spot Weir , take him out . Understood . Be careful , DJ . Don 't worry about Weir . I 'll take care of him . DJ ! DJ , answer me ! OK , Dr Weir . You don 't wanna leave your ship ? You never will . It 's OK . I 'll get you out of here . Easy . Oh , my God . What happened to your eyes ? Where we 're going , we won 't need eyes to see . What are you talking about ? I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars , but she 's gone much , much further than that . She tore a hole in our universe ... a gateway to another dimension ... a dimension of pure chaos ... pure evil . When she crossed over , she was just a ship , but when she came back ... she was alive . Look at her , Miller . Isn 't she beautiful ? Your beautiful ship killed its crew , Doctor . Well ... now she has another crew . Now she has us . What do you think you 're doing , Doctor ? You wanted to know where the ship has been ... so now you 'll find out . If you miss me , you blow out the hull . What makes you think I 'll miss ? That 's right ! I 'm back ! I 'm ... oh , shit ! I can 't stop ! Hey ! Hey ! Fuck . What ? ! Who the fuck ? ! Who the ... ? Oh , shit ! No ! Give me your hand ! - Come on ! - I can 't ! I 'm not leaving you ! Forward airlock . It can 't be Weir . I 'm not taking any chances . You watch your back . Yo ! Don 't hit me ! Take it off ! Take it off ! I can 't breathe . I can 't breathe . You 're OK . You 're OK . It 's over . No , it 's not . Weir 's activated the gravity drive . We got to shut it down . - How ? The bridge is gone . - What about Engineering ? Dr Weir was the expert . I don 't want to go where the other crew went . We 'll blow it . - Blow it ? - Like Weir said . Blow the corridor , separate us from the ship , use the foredecks as a lifeboat . TDRS should pick up our emergency beacon . We put ourselves in stasis , and stand by for rescue . I 'll manually arm these explosives . Skipper , will this work ? Go activate the emergency beacon and you get back here . - Yes , sir . - I 'm coming . You stay here . Close this door behind me , Lieutenant . Gateway opening in T-minus five minutes . Emergency beacon activated . Yes . Blood ? Oh , fuck me . Fuck me . Run ! Gateway opening in T-minus three minutes .

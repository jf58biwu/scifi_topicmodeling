 [ Slapping Sound ] I don 't understand , Sydney . Why are these guys hitting each other ? - F.E.S. , Broots . - F.E. S ? Forced External Stimulus . I 'm studying the way twins react to identically implied aggression . [ Scoffs ] Looks to me like they 're just beatin ' the bejesus out of each other . - Did you need something , Broots ? - Oh , yeah . I , uh-This came for you . Looks kind of important . " Your immediate attention is needed " ? In Jarod 's handwriting . You 've never seen this . Seen what ? [ Chuckling ] [ Imitating Curly ] Nyuk , nyuk , nyuk . Yee ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Hey , Barker ! You got a visitor ! - What ? - You got company ! - There 's a guy out front wants to see ya . - A guy ? - Yeah , with the dogs . - Dogs ? [ Barking Continues , Growling ] [ Kissing Sounds ] That 's it . Take it . Mm-hmm . [ Laughing ] Come on . Come on . Do you like dogs , Mr. Barker ? Not as much as you do . Roman fighting rottweilers . Pound for pound , the most perfect killing machine on four legs , huh ? Give me a dog over a person any day . Oh , Jack Brevins . I 'm your P.O. Parole officer ? We weren 't supposed to meet till next week . Yeah , I know . I was in the neighborhood . Big Daddy here needed to be wormed . The baby needed to be wormed , didn 't you , sweetie ? - Yeah . So , how you gettin ' on ? - Fine . - No problems with the job ? - It 's a little slice of heaven . That 's funny . You 're a funny guy . - I gotta get back to work . - Uh , let 's take a walk . - It 's not my break yet . - Hey . It 's okay . [ Dog Growls ] [ Boat Horn Blows ] You know , a lot of guys have trouble adjusting to freedom after bein ' locked up . You were up for , what - six and change ? - Mr. Brevins . - Jack . Look , I appreciate all the personal attention , Jack , but I have to get back to work . I can 't afford to lose this job . I don 't want to end up back in prison , now do I ? You don 't know how it works , do you ? You behave yourself , you do exactly what you 're told ... everything 's gravy . You get an attitude , you disrupt the program ... I pick up the phone , and you got a number on your back before breakfast . We 'll continue this later . Oh , hey . I read your file . [ Sniffs ] Consider that an advance . That 's good stuff . None of that jailhouse crap you used to shoot . I 'll be in touch . Come on , babies . Let 's go . Let 's go for a ride . Come on . Come on . Yes . Yes . - Go for a ride in the car . We love the car . Yeah . - [ Barking ] I hope you came alone . I believe you 're safe , for the moment . - You look good , Sydney . - You too . And I like the artwork . Just trying to blend in . Are you going to tell me why I 'm here , or is this some kind of game we 're playing ? Oh , it 's no game , especially to them . [ Sydney 's Voice ] Michelle , am I his father ? [ Michelle 's Voice ] Sydney , Nicholas doesn 't know he 's your son . I don 't understand . Why did you - [ Water Running ] What the-Who are-You 're - The word is - [ Whispers ] " naked . " I bought groceries . [ Chuckles ] - Hope you like sugar . - Who are you ? Sandi , with an " I. " - How did you get in here ? - Desk clerk . He 's a friend ofJack 's . - Jack Brevins ? - Is there another ? You want something to drink ? I 've got kiwi-papaya juice . A friend turned me on to it . It 's fantastic . In fact , it 's fantastically fantastic . So , you got an awesome view . It 's a lumberyard . Well , they used to be trees , so that almost makes it a forest . - You said thatJack sent you ? - Mmm . Like a housewarming gift . He said to think of me as a " living , breathing welcome mat . " There is no way this is going to happen . - What-What are you doing ? - Look , I 'm really exhausted . I had a really long day . I can 't go . If you send me away , Jack 'll think I pissed you off . Jack can get real nasty when he doesn 't get what he wants . Hey . Pretty lady . Who is she ? [ Scoffs ] She 's my mother . No . Really ? Oh , that 's so sweet . God , I haven 't seen my mom in nearly , uh , two years . So , what were you in prison for ? - Does it matter ? - Well , a girl likes to know who she 's drinkin ' with . I mean , you didn 't kill somebody , did you ? Okay . I can drop you off on my way downtown , or I can call you a cab . - Those are your choices . - Or I could go with you . Are you in some kind of trouble ? - Well , that depends . - Depends on what ? On you . We should get some more of this kiwi juice . It 's a passion fruit . Can I help you ? Oh , I 'm Dr. Sydney . I was called in to consult on the Stamatis case . I wasn 't told about any consultation . Well , there must have been some kind of clerical error , Nurse ... Roberts . I 've traveled a long way , and I 'm tired . Now , we can get on with this , or I can take it up with your supervisor . It 's up to you . [ Sighs ] That 's Mr. Stamatis 's room . Oh , Nurse . How 's he doing ? Considering he may have only hours to live ... he and Mrs. Stamatis are doing fine . Thank you . I think it 's sad when things change . I used to come here when I was a kid . There was this gigantic slide . It must 've been 50 , 60 feet high . Kind of like this monster ? [ Chuckling ] But ... it was so much bigger . Maybe because you were a little peanut back then . Uh , excuse me . I 'll be right back . Don 't eat the sand , baby . It 's almost like looking into a mirror . Yes , it is . Do you mind if I sit down ? It 's a public park . I used to wonder what it would be like to grow up so close to somebody ... to have a bond like that that could never be broken . You sound like a man who misses his family . Is it that obvious ? Some people wear their lives in their eyes ... and some on their skin . - How long you been out of prison ? - Almost a week . I wish you luck . Come on , boys . Mama 's gotta get home and get supper started . They look just like their father . What did you say ? - Who are you ? - My name is Jarod . Bobby , your husband , and I ... we were in the same cell block at Mayfield Pen . This picture ? It was taken three days before he was released . Lupe , I don 't mean to upset you . I know it 's only been a few weeks since Bobby was-was killed . Bobby had so much going for him when he got out of prison . The boys , a goodjob , me . It doesn 't make any sense . He wasn 't a violent man . - It doesn 't make any sense . - I know . That 's why I 'm here . No , you listen to me ! You miss one more appointment at this office ... I 'm gonna slap a warrant on your ass so fast , you won 't know what hit you . Yeah . Right . Right . You 're not as stupid as you look . 8.00 tonight . So , how 's freedom treating ' you on this fine morning , Jarod ? - It takes getting ' used to . - It 's a big world , full of surprises . Kinda like that surprise I found in my shower yesterday . She didn 't give you any lip , did she ? No . Just wasn 't expecting guests , that 's all . It 's like ridin 'a bicycle . You know how to ride a bicycle , don 't ya ? You get on and you just - [ Laughing ] - Now , that 's funny . - Yeah . You know what else is funny ? Here I am , fresh out of prison , and already my parole officer ... he 's supplied me with enough smack to kill a horse ... and a female who may or may not be underage . Now , if the intention is to ease the inmate back into society ... this seems a little bit rushed . Well , I didn 't expect you to shoot the entire bag in one sitting . As for the bimbo , she 's 22 goin ' on 15 . Come on . Sit down . I just like my people to be relaxed when they work . And by " work , " you don 't mean the metal shop , I assume . Jarod Barker . Arrested at age 14 ... for petty larceny . Spent six months in the Krendler Youth Camp . Three convictions for narcotics and weapons charges . Two aggravated assault convictions ... and a handful of parole violations . I won a spelling bee once when I was seven . Look . You know how many opportunities are out there for an ex-con with a history of violence ? Zero . Nada . Life as you know it is over . Be at this address tonight at 10.00 p.m. Oh , and , Jarod , one more thing . Stay away from Lupe Harmon . How 'd you know I talked to Lupe ? It 's my job to know what you do . You did time with her husband up in Mayfiield . What 's his name ? - What was his name ? - Bobby . Right . Bobby . Terrible situation . - He was one of your guys , wasn 't he ? - Just stay away from the widow . She can only cause you trouble . You 're the boss , right ? May I join you ? Sydney . What are you doing here ? I thought you might need a friend . Yeah . - I like it here . - Mmm . Especially in the morning , when everything still seems possible . Sorry . It 's all right . Thank you . He 's only 54 years old , Sydney . It 's not fair . No , it 's not . How did you know that George was here ? An old friend sent me a message . Michelle , if you want someone to talk to ... someone to hold on to , I 'm here . - [ Sighs ] - What is it ? It 's Nicholas . He 's not handling this very well . He 's so , so angry . It 's painful to lose someone you love . He still doesn 't know that you 're his real father . It 's not important now . My husband is dying , Sydney . Would you pray with me ? Of course I will . [ Sandi ] I started dancin 'when I was 17 . - Were you with the ballet ? - Yeah , right . Cleared 400 a week , and that was just workin ' topless . Topless ? What ? You 've never been in a strip joint before ? Naked women swinging around metal poles ? Strange men cramming sweaty wads of money into strange women 's panties ? - I would remember something like that . - Yeah . Did you , uh , tellJack that we took a walk in the park ? I might have mentioned it . What you workin ' on ? I 'm tryin ' to figure out why a man with a wife , two kids and a future ... would throw it all away for 256 bucks . Did you know Bobby Harmon ? No . That 's terrible . You know , I read he had small children . Twin boys . Five years old . I gotta go . Hey , Jarod ? I only danced for a couple of months . And I never-you know , for money . I just don 't want you to think that I was that kind of girl . What kind of girl is that ? [ No Audible Dialogue ] Dr. Stamatis , my name is Sydney . I know who you are . I have had this conversation in my mind a hundred times . I want you to know that I have the highest regard for you ... and your relationship with Michelle and Nicholas . Do you still love her ? You don 't need to answer . I see it in your eyes . [ Gasps ] Oh . Thank you . [ Panting ] Nicholas ... doesn 't know that you 're his real father . No . I want you to tell him after . I want you to take care of our son , Sydney . - We don 't have to - - Promise . Promise . I promise . Nicholas . - [ Groans ] - Nicholas . Nicholas ! - [ Men Cheering ] - [ Rock ] Hey , Jarod . Right on time . You didn 't have any trouble findin 'the place , did you ? It 's amazing . You tell the cabdriver where to go , and he gets you there . Ain 't it though ? Let me introduce you to your new partner . Pat Rush , Jarod Barker . Jack says you did time at Mayfield . Six years , eight months , three days . I did a two-spot there . I don 't remember your face . That 's because I like to hang by myself . [ Scoffs ] That 's cool . If you dogs are through sniffing 'each other , I 'd like to get down to business . My source informs me that there is a very accessible situation out in Meadowhills . That 's a new development out near the lake . Houses start at half a million . Gentlemen , it 's rotting on the vine . All we have to do is go out there and pick it . - I don 't know . - What did you say ? I got a bad feelin ' , that 's all . Son , you don 't know ... what feeling ' bad is really all about . [ Growling ] Yo , Jack ! Phone call ! - Take a message . - It 's the Mexican . You boys have a beer , and when I get back ... I 'll tell you all about Myra and Stanley Bellows . Guy 's certifiable . Word is he 's been runnin ' this home invasion scam for almost five years . - " Word is " ? - A guy who knows a guy . Well , someone should stop him . One call from Brevins , and we 're both back inside . Don 't even think about runnin ' to the cops unless you want to end up like that Harmon dude . - Bobby Harmon ? - The kid wasn 't blown away by accident . My guy says Harmon was about to go to the D.A. , drop Brevins 's whole operation on the table . That 's quite a little scam he 's got goin ' . Career criminals do his dirty work ... and if we refuse , well , he violates our parole and doubles our time . Not to mention those frickin ' dogs . Guy loves those frickin ' dogs . How did he know that Bobby Harmon was gonna turn him in ? Have you made one move since you 've been out he didn 't know about ? [ Bell Tolling ] How 'd you find me ? - Your father said you might come here . - Ha ! " My father " ? That 's a laugh . This will be hard for you to understand ... and you have every right to be angry , but there were reasons - Reasons ? What reasons could there be ... for hiding the truth from someone about who they are and where they came from ? Just before you were born ... I was involved with some people - very dangerous people - who made threats against my life . To protect me , your mother left without telling me about you . - Did you look for me ? - I told you . I didn 't know you 'd been born . And now I don 't have a father ... or a family or a life . Nicholas . It isn 't true . You have a wonderful mother and a father who loves you . He 's not my father . You 're wrong , Nicholas . Being a father is more than giving life . It 's being there in the middle of the night when you 're sick or afraid or alone . And it 's teaching you how to ride a bike , how to catch a fish ... how to tie a tie . Being a parent isn 't about the big moments . It 's about the little ones . Have you ever felt those things for anyone ? There was someone - a child . Your father loves you very much - as much as if he 'd given you life . - Don 't throw that away . - Why are you here ? After everything is said and done ... maybe you and I can be friends . [ Leaves Rustling ] Hello ? Is someone there ? [ Brevins ] The key is to convince these people that you are serious ... that you will kill them ... if they do not do exactly what you want them to do . - And what about Bobby Harmon ? - What about him ? I don 't want to end up dead on someone 's living room floor because you forgot something . [ Sighs ] Harmon was a mistake . End of story . How much money did you say these people keep in the house ? It could be north of $ 100,000 . Apparently , the old gentleman does not trust banks . Just make sure you kill this power box before you enter the house . That disables the floodlights , the security system . It 'll keep the rent-a-cops off your tail . And what do we do when we 're finished ? You stop by my house , and we split up the money . We go in 12 hours . Everybody ready ? Ready . They say it takes the patience of a saint to tend to a prosperous garden . You know about flowers ? I know about patience . I used to send Bobby a single red rose every Friday . He used to put them in the window of his cell . He said they made him feel like there was something worth living for . You know , Bobby wrote me twice a week . He never mentioned anyone named Jarod . Oh , yeah , he probably wouldn 't . I was transferred to Bobby 's cell block three weeks before he was released ... so , you know , he probably had ... other things on his mind . - Come here , baby . - You have great kids . You know , in the park you said you 'd come here for a reason . I think Bobby was set up . Set up ? Why would anyone want to hurt my husband ? That 's what I 'm trying to find out . Where are my manners ? Uh , please , can I get you something to drink ? - That would be very nice . - It 'll have to be water or kiwi juice . - Kiwi juice ? - Yeah , kiwi-papaya . It was Bobby 's favorite . There must be a dozen bottles left in the refrigerator . [ Chuckles ] - Busy day ? - Oh , God . Jarod , I didn 't see you standing there . That 's surprising . I thought you were keepin ' a close eye on me . I bought some steaks and a bottle of wine . I thought maybe we could go up on the roof and have ourselves a cookout . - You knew Bobby Harmon . - Jarod , I - Please don 't lie to me . I knew Bobby . Why didn 't you tell me ? I was scared . I mean , Bobby and me were friends . No , it wasn 't like that . He loved his wife and his kids . You told Brevins that Bobby was going to turn him in to the police . No . No , I never mentioned that to anybody except for - Except for who ? Pat Rush . And what about me ? What 's the deal with me ? Jack wanted me to get close . Jarod , I had no choice . This has something to do with that guy I saw you talking to at the convalescent home . - You followed me ? - Who was he ? Just another sucker ? Or maybe just a former client that you took pity on ? He 's my little brother . His name is Michael . The doctors say he 'll never be any better than he is now . It was raining , and Michael had invited me to dinner and the movies . He loves the movies . I , uh , never saw the other car run the light . Is that why your mother won 't speak to you ? Yeah , I was his big sister , you know ? I was supposed to be looking out for him . I thought that paying for Michael 's medical care might turn things around ... and make her understand that it was an accident . Private hospitals are expensive . Three thousand dollars a month . That 's how you got involved with Brevins . You needed the money to take care of your little brother . I had nothing to do with what happened to Bobby , I swear . After Bobby was killed , I got scared , and I was gonna go to the police , but ... Jack threatened to hurt Michael . I didn 't know what else to do . Don 't worry . I 'll take care of it . I promise . [ No Audible Dialogue ] You down for this ? Cut the power , bust open the side door , wait for you to come through the front . - Everything by the numbers . - By the numbers . - You don 't seem convinced . - We screw this up , we 're both dead men . Well , we better not screw it up then . Notify all cars in the area of Fourth and Grove . Bank robbery , First National . [ Angry Grumbling ] [ Footsteps ] [ Grunts ] Oh , Jack ? - Wake up ! - What ? - It is okay if I still call you Jack , right ? - Barker ? Is that you , Barker ? You stinking ' punk ! - I 'm gonna burn you for this ! - I told you this was gonna blow up in our faces ! Rush ? Is that you , kid ? Kid , listen to me ! You 're makin a life decision here ! Make the right one ! - Let 's just split right now ! - Would you just chill out ? You said he 's been doin ' this home invasion thing for the last five years . - So what ? - So what ? Open your eyes , dumb-ass ! Look around ! There 's more loot here than we 're ever gonna find in any cul-de-sac in the suburbs . - Ain 't that right , Jack ? - You clowns are robbing me ? That 's what this is all about ? You 're robbing me ? It stings , don 't it , Jack ? Just like it must 've stung ... Bobby Harmon ... when you killed him . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Why are you talkin ' about Harmon ? Let 's just do this and get out of here ! - A little change of plans , Pat . - What are you talkin ' about ? You see , I 'm not exactly who I pretend to be . The truth is , I 've never been arrested before , but you will be . I 'll make sure they put you away for aiding and abetting in the murder of Bobby Harmon . - Kill him , Pat ! - Who are you ? I 'm still tryin ' to figure that one out . But as for you ? It 's over . - I don 't think so . - Are you gonna shoot me ? - I 'll do it . I swear . - Go ahead . - Do it ! - [ Clicks ] [ Angry Grunt ] Back off , Barker ! It was a pleasure doing business with you . Well , looks like it 's just you and me , Jack . What do you want from me ? Did you kill Bobby Harmon ? You 're gonna rot in prison , Barker . - Answer my question ! - Go to hell ! Okay , fine . I 'm just gonna have to take it up with your four-legged friends in the next room . Hey , what are you doin ' ? Let 's just see how much you really love those little guys . Actually , I 'll start with the little one . [ Whimpering ] Junior ? Hey , Barker , what the hell are you doin ' ? - Junior ? Here , Junior ! - Barker , don 't hurt that dog ! - [ Gunshot ] - [ Dog Whining ] No ! You son of a bitch ! You killed my dog ? Well , are you ready to answer my question now , Jack ? Look , you leave Big Daddy alone , huh ? Well , Big Daddy 's gonna fry unless you answer my question . You hurt that dog , man , I will cut your heart out ! - All right , Jack . Have it your way . - No . Barker ? - All right , Big Daddy . You 're up . - Barker ! No , wait ! Barker ! All right , I did it ! I did it ! You did what ? You ... did ... what ? I killed Bobby Harmon . I made it look like it was a robbery . How many other home invasion robberies using parolees were you involved with ? - L - - [ Shouts ] How many ? Uh , 10 , 12 . Come on . Take this blindfold off me , will you , man ? - Sure thing , Jack . - [ Dog Whining ] What the hell ? Hey ! I heard my dogs . - I heard you shoot ! - What , this ? Neat trick , huh ? Oh , one other thing . - Look at this ! - [ Tape : Dog Barking ] Huh ? [ Dogs Barking In Rhythm . " Jingle Bells " ] - [ Continues ] - Merry Christmas , Jack . I 'll get you , Barker ! Damn you ! [ Barking Continues ] - Barker ! - [ Stops ] Pardon me , Mrs. Stamatis , but the doctor thinks you should say good-bye now . - I don 't think I can do this . - I can go in with you . No , no . L - I need to be alone with him . But Nicholas should be here . He needs to say good-bye to him . Hi . - Hey . - Hey . It 's all right . Don 't be afraid . - I 'm not . - [ Sniffles ] I love you ... so much . Always . It just doesn 't seem fair . We have so much to do . We have so much more to share . Shh . We will be ... together again , I know it . Come here . Come here . - Oh , my baby . - [ Quiet Crying ] Where 's Nick , huh ? Oh . Sorry I 'm late . - I 'm here , Dad . - Nick . - I 'm here . - Hey , buddy . Hey . [ Monitor . Steady Beeping ] [ Bell Tolling ] " Thank you " will just never be enough . I 'm glad I was of some comfort to you . What now ? Well , I go home and try to get on with the rest of my life . A good life . Good-bye , Sydney . Until we meet again . I never thought I could feel more alone than I did ... when I heard my father was dying . - I was wrong . - Time 's a great healer . Time . Is that how you got over losing your family ? I will never get over that ... not as long as I live . My office number at the university ... if you ever - if you ever want to talk . Who shall I say I am , if your assistant asks ? You can say that you 're my friend . [ Engine Starts ] That 's a pretty good start . Well , a man can 't ask for more than an opportunity . And I owe any chance I have of knowing my son to you , Jarod . Well , everyone deserves to have a family . Jarod ? Didn 't I teach you how to tie a tie ? Yes . Yes , you did .

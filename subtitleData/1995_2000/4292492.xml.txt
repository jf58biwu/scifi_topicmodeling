 [ Foot steps ] [ Squeaking ] [ Fizzling Sound ] [ Siren Blaring In Distance ] [ Lighter Clicks Shut ] [ Electronic Humming ] [ Scully ] Not everything is a labyrinth of conspiracies . Look , you 're shaking . [ Mulder ] One at a time , boys . Now what 's going on ? - [ Man # 1 ] Frohike 's close . - [ Frohike ] Don 't use my name ! [ Frohike ] What 's wrong with you ? Now I 'll have to kill you . [ Man # 1 ] Langley and I performed three sweeps with the CpM-700 . [ Frohike ] The CpM-700 is a piece of crap ! [ Man # 1 ] The acoustic correlator is reading only passive sounds . [ Mulder ] I 've been here 20 minutes , and I still don 't know what the hell is wrong ! No one would kill you , Frohike . You 're just a little puppy dog . [ Frohike ] I don 't utter another syllable ... until the CSM-25 counter measure filter is activated . [ Electronic Static , Garbled Voices ] [ Static Increases , Stops ] [ Man # 1 ] No electronic surveillance known can cut through the CSM-25 . [ Scully ] Okay , okay . Now tell us what you 're so close to . [ Frohike ] Not a what , a who . If you find the right starting point and follow it , not even secrets of the darkest of men are safe . [ Mulder ] Cancer Man ? What did you find ? [ Frohike ] possibly everything . Maybe his background , who he is , and who he wants to be . [ Frohike ] August 20th , 1940 , Mexico City . A Stalinist agent assassinated Leon Trotsky with an ice pick . At that same moment , a thousand miles north , in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , " he " appears . The father was an ardent communist activist . During the Nazi-Soviet pact , he kept the NKVD informed ... on American plans to enter World War II . He was executed under the Espionage Act of 1917 , before his boy could walk . The mother , a cigarette smoker , died of lung cancer ... before her son uttered his first word . With no surviving family , he became a ward of the state , sent to various orphanages in the Midwest . Didn 't make friends . Spent all his time reading- - alone . And then he appears to have vanished , until a year and a half after the Bay of pigs . [ Man ] premier Khrushchev , we want you ! [ Troops ] Premier Khrushchev , we want you ! We 're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo ! We 're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo ! Fidel Castro , we want you ! Fidel Castro , we want you ! We 're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo ! We 're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo ! [ Man ] Mother Russia- - [ Man Shouts , Indistinct ] [ Man ] Hey , I wanna see that when you 're done with it . [ Men Chattering ] Why don 't you just go see the movie ? I 'd rather read the worst novel ever written ... than sit through the best movie ever made . Captain , sir ! General Francis requests you report to his office ASAP , sir ! My one-year-old just said his first word . - What was the word ? - J.F.K. Catch ya later , Mulder . - [ Buzzer ] - [ Man ] He 's here , sir . Send him in . You wish to see me , sir ? Have a seat , Captain . Captain , have you ever seen these two men , met the General ... - or myself ? . - No , sir . In January , 1961 , did you aid Congo President Kasavuba ... in the arrest and assassination of Patrice Lumumba ? No , sir . Were you involved in the training ... of Cuban nationals during Operation Zapata , also known as the Bay of pigs ? I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm unaware of any such operation . On May 31st , 1961 , did you aid Dominican locals in the assassination of Rafael Trujillo ? No , sir . Your father was a convicted spy for the Soviet Union . Executed in a Louisiana electric chair , was he not ? My only regret , sir , is I was too young to throw the switch myself . At ease , Captain . Your father 's actions were totally out of your control . Each of us in this room ... understands a life eviscerated by the actions of another . Cigarette ? No , thank you , sir . I never touch ' em . You see , Captain , most people seek to control life 's events ... in order to secure a more positive , productive and free existence . Often , however , the objectives of others conflict with our objectives . Viva la libertad . Now , most people- - common people , really- - can barely manage to control their own self-centered , myopic existence . They command armies of lawyers armed with paper weapons , attacking with spiteful , vengeful , cowardly litigation . Others ... operate within elephantine bureaucracies . And then , Captain , there are extraordinary men . Those who must identify , comprehend , and ultimately shoulder the responsibility ... for not only their own existence , but their country 's , and the world 's , as well . Your father , Captain , believed his country should look to another form of government , and he took control of that belief . So , in that respect , we view him as an extraordinary man . And we believe- - We know , Captain , that it runs in the family . Now , don 't misunderstand . Your father should have been executed . Communism is , without a doubt , the most heinous personification of evil mankind has ever confronted . And it is , in part , the reason that you are before us here today . You must understand , Captain , everything I 'm about to say is classified " compartmentalized . " So intensely that if you accept this assignment ... and successfully execute it , you will no longer be ... an officer of the United States Army , nor will any record exist of your service . The assignment ... is the assassination of an American civilian , aged 46 , former naval p . T. boat commander . Married , father of two . Last week , Captain , this country was brought to the brink of nuclear annihilation . A situation which never would have a risen ... had the individual in question , as Commander in Chief , provided an umbrella of air support ... during the invasion at Bahia de Cochinos . Is there a cover story ? Tell ' em it was done by men from outer space . We 've found , and are setting up , a patsy . Where ? [ Dog Barking ] You shouldn 't smoke those , Lee . I 'm reading studies that say they can kill you . Well , Mr. Hunt , sir , uh , I 've heard about those reports and ... they are no doubt correct . You 'll have a good view of the president today . Well , I-I like the president 's family . They 're interesting people . However , I have my own views on the president 's national policy . I 'll probably just eat lunch . I 'm going to the movies at the Texas Theater . It 's only 90 cents . I love the movies . I brought the curtain rods , Lee . I bought curtain rods just like this from a mail order back in March . You did ? Or A.J. Hidell ? Well , Mr. Hunt , Fidel 's defenders have to be careful . Yes , we do . Speaking of which , Lee , I 've informed our fellow defender ... that you will hide the curtain rods on the sixth floor ... of the book depository , behind the cartons against the back wall . The Cuban visa ? Once I 've been notified the curtain rods ... have been safely removed from the depository , the visa and the money for your trip will be in your room . Take a bus . I left all my money with my wife . That 's all I 've got- - 13 and change . You better get going , Lee . You wouldn 't want to miss your ride to work . [ Shuffling Sound ] Oh . Good morning , Lee . Starting work right on time . Yes , sir . [ Man ] The president should be driving past any minute . [ Man ] The president should be driving past any minute . I think I hear every one down on the fifth floor . Where 's Lee ? Does he wanna come ? [ Man ] Better hurry up . [ Chattering ] [ Cheering ] [ Man On Radio ] The president 's car is now turning onto Elm Street . [ Sighs ] I was on the Stemmons Freeway earlier , and even the freeway was jam packed ... with spectators waiting to see the president . people are really starting to crowd in now . [ Buzzing Sound ] The motorcade is heading down Elm Street now , passing the Texas School Book Depository . [ Cheering ] [ Gunshots ] [ people Screaming ] I can 't quite see from here . - It appears something has happened on the motorcade route . - [ Sirens Blaring ] Does anyone know what happened ? Is there any information ? [ Man ] Upstairs ! - Do you know this man ? - Yes , he works for me . - Let 's go ! - [ people Shouting ] [ Sirens Blaring , people Shouting ] [ Man On Radio ] The president of the United States is dead . It is official now . president Kennedy is dead . No ! No ! No , sir ! I won 't be a patsy . [ people Chattering ] [ police Radio : Indistinct ] ... should be considered dangerous , and use caution approaching . Afternoon . [ Radio Continues : Indistinct ] I wish to see some form of identification , sir . Now easy there , partner . I just wanna talk a minute . If I don 't see valid credentials , I 'm gonna assume you 're with them . Them ? What do you mean , partner ? - [ Groans ] - [ Gunshots ] [ police Radio : ; Indistinct ] How about a cigarette ? Thank you . You know , Keiffer knocked out a bunker . [ Soldier # 1 ] All by himself , too . [ Soldier # 2 ] That 's more guts than I 've got . All I did was pick up the spoils . [ Soldier # 1 ] But he 's really got ' em . After Connors and Thurston ran , he knocked out the bunker with one grenade . Now that 's really somethin ' , huh ? Yeah . [ people Grumbling ] [ Cop ] We won 't be long . On your feet . Come on . It 's gonna be all over . He 's got a gun ! [ Shouting ] Take him down ! I 'm not resisting arrest ! I 'm not resisting arrest ! Stop hitting me , you sons of bitches ! I 'm not the one ! I 'm not the one ! I 'm not the one ! This is police brutality ! This is police brutality ! I 'm not resisting arrest ! [ Cop ] put him in the car ! [ Oswald ] Let me go ! [ Cops , Oswald Shouting ] [ Siren Blaring ] [ Martin Luther King , Jr . ] We must , with positive action , - seek to remove those conditions of poverty , - [ Typing Sound ] insecurity and injustice ... which are the fertile soil in which ... the seed of communism grows and develops . - These are revolutionary times . - [ Type writer Bell Dings ] All over the globe , men are revolting against old systems ... of exploitation and oppression . And out of the wombs of a frail world , - new systems of justice and equality are being born . - [ Mumbles ] The shirtless and barefoot people of the land ... are rising up as never before . " I can kill you whenever I please . " We in the West have seen a great light . We in the West must support these revolutions . " But not today . " [ King ] It is a sad fact that because of comfort , complacency , a morbid fear of communism and our proneness to adjust to injustice , the Western nations that initiated ... so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world ... have now become the arch-antirevolutionaries . This has driven many to feel that only Marxism ... has the revolutionary spirit . Therefore , communism is a judgment ... against our failure to make democracy real ... and follow through on the revolutions that we initiated . No , no . Why 'd you have to do that ? ... to recapture the revolution- - Why didn 't you know this was coming , Edgar ? [ Coughs ] Last year the House was not smiling on non eye-to-eye surveillance . [ Edgar ] So I stopped . We called Ramsey Clark to receive a go-ahead ... on tapping King 's phone , but he refused . Our Behind the Fence operations on WILLI E ... believes that King 's ally , Stokeley Carmichael , is recruiting ' a Negro army to wage war on white America . Wouldn 't you , if you were them ? If this were only a civil rights issue , I 'd vote for a King-Benjamin Spock presidential ticket . But after last night , it 's not . You actually sound sad about it . I respect King . He 's an extraordinary man . But now he 's talking like a Maoist . And if he convinces Negroes not to fight in Vietnam , we 'll lose . And the first domino will have fallen . We must step up our efforts to discredit him . Like your ridiculous suicide project ? " There is but one way out for you " ? That dumb letter attempting to drive King into despair ... only alerted him to the level of our surveillance . We could create a film of him with a woman other than his wife . Using existing footage , we could insert him in a film we make of a woman- - a white woman . The solution is more intense ... than just dirty tricks . If you 'll excuse us , gentlemen , the Director has a meeting at the White House . Sit down . You 've enough plausible deniability to last the rest of your nine lives . A SIG Force can execute a wet-insert operation . One day , he and his immediate circle are just found dead . Too many questions . Too many questions . Americans believe the South is still fighting the Civil War . We find ourselves a cracker patsy , and the motives become very black and white . Another patsy . Should we advise the president ? I work very hard to keep any president from knowing I even exist . Who will you order to do it ? I 'll do it myself . I have too much respect for the man . [ King ] The nation is sick . Trouble is in the land , confusion all around . That 's a strange statement . But I know , somehow , that only when it is dark enough ... can you see the stars . And I see God working ... in this period of the twentieth century ... in a wave ... that men , in some strange way , are responding . Something is happening in our world . The masses of people are rising up . And wherever they are assembled today , whether they are in Johannesburg , South Africa , ; Nairobi , Kenya , ; Akra , Ghana , ; New York City , ; Atlanta , Georgia , ; Jackson , Mississippi or Memphis , Tennessee , the cry is always the same : ; We want to be free . [ people Cheering ] [ Foot steps Approaching ] Raul . I got the binoculars you sent me out for . Just put ' em down by your clothes . I heard , uh , Dr. King 's stayin ' at the Lorraine Motel , right behind here . Our gun buyer 's coming by to look at the rifle . Well , I gave it to you this mornin ' . I have it . Look , uh , three 's a crowd . Here 's a couple of hundred . Go to a movie or something . Come back in two or three hours . Leave the Mustang . I 'll need it later . [ King 's Voice ] Well , I don 't know what will happen now . We 've got some difficult days ahead . But it really doesn 't matter to me now . Because I 've been to the mountaintop . [ people Cheering ] And I don 't mind . Like anybody , I would like to live along life . Longevity has its place . But I 'm not concerned about that now . I just want to do God 's will . And He 's allowed me to go up to the mountain . And I 've looked over . And I 've seen the promised land . [ Cheering ] I may not get there with you . But I want you to know tonight ... that we , as people , will get to the promised land ! [ Cheering ] So I 'm happy tonight . I 'm not worried about anything ! I 'm not fearing any man ! Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord ! [ Gunshot Echoing ] [ Man On TV : ; Indistinct ] [ TVContinues : ; Indistinct ] ... has touched off declarations of states of emergency ... in several cities . In Washington , D. C.- - [ TVContinues : ; Indistinct ] New York State 's Senator Robert F. Kennedy ... has made an appeal for calm . [ Kennedy ] I would only say that I can also feel , in my own heart , the same kind of feeling . I had a member of my family killed . But he was killed by a white man . My favorite poet was Aeschylus . And he once wrote , " Even in our sleep , pain which cannot forget ... - [ Continues ] - " Falls drop by drop upon the heart , " Until , in our own despair , " Against our own will , comes wisdom ... - through the awful grace of God . " - [ Man Continues ] [ Frohike Continues : ; Indistinct ] [ Siren Blaring in Distance ] All right , gentlemen . Let 's make this short and sweet so we can all go home for Christmas . Domestic unrest operations ? Yeah . The Anita Hill thing has lost steam since October . Well , let it go . We played it right . Unfounded allegations will be flying around in no time . L.A. ? The Rodney King trial 's been moved to Simi Valley , just as you instructed . [ Beeping ] - Call back . - Internationally , Bosnia-Herzegovina ... is set for a February vote on independence from Yugoslavia . America couldn 't care less . I 'm working on next month 's Oscar nominations . - Any preference ? - I couldn 't care less . What I don 't want to see is the Bills winning the Super Bowl . As long as I 'm alive , that doesn 't happen . Could be tough , sir . Buffalo wants it bad . So did the Soviets in ' 80 . What , are you saying you rigged the Olympic hockey game ? What 's the matter ? Don 't you believe in miracles ? The boss gave the Russian goaltender a little pre-game ... good luck pat on the back . Unseen Novocain needle on a bogus wedding ring . Goalie 's a little slow on the stick side . Four-three , home team . Payback 's a bitch , Ivan . Well , gentlemen , if that 'll be all- - One thing internally , sir . That " Spooky " kid who talked his way ... into opening the X-Files , he feels like trouble . He 's mine to keep an eye on . [ Beeping ] Gorbachev has just resigned . There 's no more enemies . [ Opens Briefcase ] Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . If you don 't have any plans , sir , we 're all getting together with our families out in Virginia . You 're more than welcome to- - Oh . Well . Uh- - I have to , uh , see some , uh ... family . [ Keyboard Clicking ] [ Andy Williams ] # # it 's the most wonderful time of the year # # # # With the kids jingle-belling # # # # And everyone telling you be of good cheer # # # # it 's the most wonderful time of the year # # # # it 's the hap-happiest season off all # # # # With those holiday greetings and gay , happy feelings # # # # When friends come to call # # # # it 's the hap-happiest season of all # # [ Song Continues ] [ Bell Dings ] [ Song Continues ] [ Bell Dings ] [ phone Ringing ] Yeah ? [ Man ] You 'll never believe what we just got for Christmas . [ Shouting ] The craft matches the dimensions of the vehicle spotted over Hanoi ... when I was in Vietnam with The Company , that the Marines couldn 't shoot down . - Occupant ? - Critical . Timing couldn 't be worse . The Roswell story we concocted was gathering momentum . Had them all looking in the wrong direction . - With luck we 'll get away with it . - No luck tonight . Our Aurora spy planes confirm the Russians tracked entry ... and have pinpointed touchdown . Haven 't you heard ? There are no Russians anymore . I don 't care if they 're in the midst of ruin . The KGB is not going to ignore an event of this magnitude- - nor the Chinese , nor the Germans , nor the British , nor anyone ... who has the capability of discovering what happened here tonight . I 'm certain each of them ... has operatives advancing on us right now . How many historic events have ... only the two of us witnessed together , Ronald ? How often did we make or change history ? And our names can never ... grace any pages of record . No monument will ever bear our image . And yet , once again tonight , the course of human history will be set by two unknown men , standing in the shadows . A living E.B.E. could advance Bill Mulder 's project by decades . Security Council resolution 1 01 3 ... states any country capturing such an entity ... is responsible for its immediate extermination . I 'm the liar . You 're the killer . Your lies have killed more men in a day than I have in a lifetime . I 've never killed anybody . Maybe I 'm not the liar . I have a chance to go an entire lifetime ... without killing anybody or any thing . With all of our work in the past 30 years , all of our victories , if the world were to see this , it would destroy all we 've gained in a few hours . Tonight , we have a new ... enemy . Heads . Go ahead . Make history . [ Beeping Sound ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Gunshot ] [ Monotone Electronic Hum ] [ Indistinct Voice ] [ Frohike ] At that point , your work in the basement ... was getting attention from the top floor . And that 's why you were brought in . [ Man # 1 ] Agent Scully , thank you for coming on such short notice . [ Man # 2 ] Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder ? - [ Scully ] Yes , lam . - [ Man # 2 ] How so ? By reputation . Um , he 's an Oxford-educated psychologist ... who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult ... that helped to catch Monty Propps in 1988 . Generally thought of as the best analyst in the Violent Crimes section . He had a nickname at the Academy- - " Spooky " Mulder . [ Man # 2 ] What I 'll also tell you is that Agent Mulder ... has developed a consuming devotion ... to an unassigned project outside the Bureau mainstream . Are you familiar with the so-called X-Files ? [ Knocking ] [ Mulder ] Sorry . Nobody down here but the FBI 's most unwanted . [ Scully ] Agent Mulder . I 'm Dana Scully . I 've been assigned to work with you . [ Mulder ] Oh , isn 't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded ? So who did you tick off to get stuck with this detail , Scully ? [ Scully ] Actually , I 'm looking forward to working with you . - I 've heard a lot about you . - [ Mulder ] Oh , really ? [ Mulder ] I was under the impression that you were sent to spy on me . [ Frohike ] Henry David Thoreau wrote , " The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation . " His life has been anything but quiet . Yet , I believe , nothing but desperate . He 's the most dangerous man alive . Not so much because he believes in his actions , but because he believes these actions are all which life allows him . And yet , the only person that can never escape him ... is himself . [ Dial Tone ] [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Woman ] Pivotal Publishing . - Um , uh , Walden Roth , please . - [ Woman ] One moment . - [ Man ] Walden Roth . Oh , Mr. Roth , hello . Uh , this is Raul Bloodworth , author of Second Chance : ; A Jack Colquitt Adventure . Yes , of course , Mr. Bloodworth . What an active imagination you have- - alien assassinations . Is it too much ? l-l mean , is my imagination too active ? No , no . I love it . Now , as I 've expressed in the letter , I wish to serialize your novel in our publication , Roman A 'Clef . Many outstanding authors receive their first printing in our publications . [ Laughing ] Th-That 's great . Um , I had an idea about the artwork . I-l thought it could have a kind of Tom Clancy-is kind of look , and that- - Great , great . That 's why we work with young writers . But I 'll be honest , however . You 'll have to relinquish some control . Of course . Of course . After all , it is our publication . And I can assure you , we 'll handle it with the utmost respect . No , no , no . I 'm-I 'm sure you will . I 'm- - I 'm just excited . Understandable . Now , do you have an agent or attorney ? - No . - That 's fine . It 's a minimum agreement of $ 2,500 , and you 'll save yourself ten percent . Well , that 's fine , that 's fine . An-Anything . When do you plan to publish the story ? Roman A 'Clef . It 'll be on the newsstands the morning of November 12th . [ Bell Dings ] [ Traffic Sounds ] [ people Chattering ] [ Man ] Hey , buddy , you can 't park there ! Excuse me , sir . Have you got this week 's issue of Roman A ' Clef ? - Thanks . - Yeah . This isn 't the ending that I wrote . It 's all wrong . If you 're gonna stand there and read it , I gotta ask you to buy it . Of course , I don 't know why anybody in their right mind ... would wanna buy that sort of crap . That be it ? Pack of Morleys . [ Clattering Sound ] [ Rattling Sound ] Life is like a box of chocolates . A cheap , thoughtless , perfunctory gift that nobody ever asks for . Unreturnable because all you get back is another box of chocolates . So you 're stuck with this undefinable whipped mint crap ... that you mindlessly wolf down when there 's nothing else left to eat . Sure , once in a while there 's a peanut butter cup ... or an English toffee , but they 're gone too fast and the taste is fleeting . So you end up with nothing but ... broken bits filled with hardened jelly ... and teeth-shattering nuts . If you 're desperate enough to eat those , all you 've got left is a- - is an empty box ... filled with useless brown paper wrappers . [ Frohike ] So far , this is based only on a story I read ... in one of my weekly subscriptions that ranga few bells . I 'm going to check on a private hacker source ... who 's been working on tracking a few leads ... that could produce definitive proof . And then we 'll have him nailed . I can kill you whenever please . But not today . SUbrip by dreamer ( C )

 [ Man Narrating ] My name is John Fitzgerald Byers . I was named after our 35th president . And I keep having this beautiful dream . In my dream , the events of November 22 , 1 963 ... never happened . In it , my namesake was never assassinated . Other things are different too in my dream . My country is hopeful and innocent , young again , young in spirit . My fellow citizens trust their elected officials , never once having been betrayed by them . My government is truly of the people , by the people , for the people . All my hopes- - for my country , for myself- - all are fulfilled . I have everything a person could want- - home and family ... and love . Everything that counts for anything in life ... I have it . But the dream ends the same way every time . I lose it all . The game is Texas Hold ' Em , gentlemen . - You bring your wife ? - [ Chuckles ] You think I 'm sitting here , I bring my wife ? - Dumb-ass brought his wife . - ' Cause I 'm the man . I say I 'm playing poker , I play poker . Meanwhile , your wife is back in Plano boinking the mailman . Hey , what was your name again ? Funsten . Stuart Funsten . Hi . [ Man ] Hey , you bring a little lady , Stuart ? I 'm not married . Smart man . A hundred . You guys come to this every year ? Def-Con ? Every year . Fold . - Wouldn 't miss it . - Yeah . Out . So , you guys working on anything interesting these days ? [ Scoffs ] Same old black-ops crapola . You know what it 's like . Hey , we 're doing some neat stuff with neutron bombardment . Yeah , you can cook somebody 's brain in their skull , like hard-boiling an egg . - It 's neat stuff ! - [ Man Sighs ] Speaking of crapola- - Fold . - Thank you . - Oh . A man of distinction . So , you in , Mr. Funsten ? Yeah . Looks like it 's just you and me . Another 200 . I 'll see your 200 , and raise you 1 , 000 . [ Man Chuckles ] - He 's buying the pot , Stu . - Three clubs showing . Could be a flush . One thousand , and I raise you one thousand . - What stones he has ! - Yeah ! [ Clearing Throat ] I see you work for Conglomerated . You guys make a great AE-1 3 5 unit . [ Man Over Earpiece ] Oh , man , don 't freak . Don 't freak . I 'm on it . AE-1 3 5 . Searching . Bingo ! 442-J-Stroke-AE-1 3 5 . Air conditioning units for B-2 bombers . Talk air conditioners . Oh , yeah . The AE-1 3 5 's a beauty . Keeps the B-2s frosty . You can practically see your breath . How 'd you get all the bugs out of it ? Ah , you know- - trade secrets . Come on , Stuart . You 're among friends . Seriously , how 'd you get past the " " delamination " thing ? " Delamination . " I 'm searching . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'll see your thousand , and ... raise you all you 've got . Systems test . Error rates- - nothing . Stall him and fold ! You want to know how we fixed the " " delamination " problem ? We subcontracted the whole damn thing to thejapanese , then triple-billed the government . Same thing we always do . Queen-high flush . [ Man ] God ! - King-high . - [ Men Chuckling ] - [ Tray Hits Floor ] - [ Groans ] Al , call security . Have them pick up Mr. Funsten here and his partner . " " Delamination . " You made that up . My advice to you , Stuart- - or whatever your name really is- - poker is not your game . Hey , man , you want to thunderdome ? Let 's go ! Three thousand dollars ! I told you to fold . That should have been me in there playing . - Why does Byers get to do the undercover ? - ' Cause this ain 't Woodstock . - Did we at least get some usable prints off the drink glasses ? - What ? Are you kidding ? I had to leave them all behind . - How are we gonna salvage this ? - We 're not . This convention 's a bust . Five days and three grand invested . We 've got bubkes to show for it . Who was that player , anyway ? The guy who made us . - He wasn 't wearing a convention badge . - Nobody ever said his name . - I think he 's worth looking into . - [ Knocking On Door ] C.I.A. ! Open up ! Hey . Jimmy and Timmy . Hey . Where were you guys today ? Around . - Oh , yeah ? Maybe snooping for some hot 41 1 ? - On the sneak tip ? - Maybe . - Yeah , well , maybe we were too . - And maybe we got some . - Well , maybe we did too . Ah , we got bubkes . Bunch of tight-lipped defense contractors . Yeah , I 'm gonna go way out on a limb here and say it 's the T-shirt . Yeah . Maybe both of you could wear one that says " I 'm with stupid . " You just don 't get it , man . This says that I 'm onto them . This says that I comprehend the military-industrial power dynamic . That 's what this whole thing is about . Wetworks , political assassination . That 's their theme for this year . - Where did you hear that ? - Oh , yeah . Like I 'm gonna reveal my sources . Suffice it to say , there 's some big , new stealth assassination technology ... that 's supposed to be unveiled here , and I will be there , front row . In the meantime , we 're hitting the restaurant . - Yeah , all-you-can-eat lobster buffet . - Free floor show . Plenty of boobage . You guys down ? - Sure . - You go ahead . I 'll catch up . - You 're one hell of a sad sack , Byers . - Lay off about the poker game . No , that 's not what I 'm talking about . You 're the one who pushes the hardest for us to come to these conventions , and then you get all squirrely once we get here . You 're still looking for her , aren 't you ? - Susanne Modeski . - We met her at a convention . Ten years ago , in Baltimore . And we both know what happened to her . Most likely , she 's dead . No . She was a brilliant scientist- - too important to the government . Buddy , either way , I know we 're both hoping ... she 's in a better place than Las Vegas . Come on . All-you-can-eat lobster . - I almost won . - Yeah , you and everyone else . Byers , check this out . I 'm feeling lucky . - It can 't be . - What ? I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . Byers ! What the hell 's going on ? [ Ringing ] - Yeah , Scully . - [ Mulder ] Hey , Scully , it 's me . - Mulder , what time is it ? - 2 : 34 a.m. Listen , Scully , I need you on the next flight to Las Vegas . Las Vegas ? Why ? - It 's the Lone Gunmen . They 're on to something big . - What , exactly ? [ Mulder 's Voice ] It 's really important . Trust me . Yeah , I trust you , Mulder . It 's the Three Stooges I 'm not so sure about . Look , I can 't talk over an unsecured line . Please just get here . It 's an emergency . Okay . Okay , okay , okay . - What if she calls him back ? - I trapped her cell number . If she calls him , it rings here . She 's gonna kick our ass . What do you need Scully for anyway ? We 're up against agents of the government . We need our own government agent . And that would be Mulder . - Why do you want just Scully ? - She 's gonna kick our ass . Mulder 's too high-profile . He 's virtually a household name ... to the black-ops who kidnapped Susanne in Baltimore . Byers , I 've hacked into the hotel computer . Susanne Modeski 's not registered here . Are you sure you saw her ? Are you absolutely , positively sure ? It was her . She 's here . I 've gotta find her . You 've gotta find some ice . You need a drink . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Where were you ? Just wasting time at a poker game . [ Langly ] Byers is trying to kill himself . Stop trying to kill yourself , Byers . It 's not deep enough . Come see what we got . Room 1 066 . Registered to our mystery poker player- - one Grant Ellis . New Mexico plates on his car . Which come back listed D.O.D. motor pool . - Signed out from- - - Whitestone , New Mexico . The Advanced Army Weapons Facility , where Susanne worked . Ellis 's credit cards get billed directly to the administrative offices . He 's looking like he 's some kind of shadow government pooh-bah . He brainwashed her . Well , that 's what they do there ! The E-H gas she developed . Call it psychological warfare , behavior modification , but it 's all about mind control . And undoubtedly the process has been refined in the last decade . She ran from them . Refused to take part in their tests- - their crimes against the American people . There 's no way she would choose to be working for them now , working for that guy , kissing him . Clearly , he brainwashed her . I know a way to find out . Buenos dias . I can 't get into the conference . The guard who threw me out is working the door . Let me go . C.I.A. ! Freeze ! That just keeps getting funnier . Where 's your girlfriend Timmy ? Out in the desert . There 's this naked chick who 'll teach you how to shoot machine guns . It costs 200 beans , though . I told him he was a putz . What 's the matter , Byers ? Your bestest dog die ? What 's up ? We 're trying to figure out how to get into the Saguaro Room . Good luck ! That 's the Holy Grail . Bug sweeps ? Casino security outside ? Government security inside ? - There 's no way any of us are getting in . - I can get in there . And I will too , when the time is right . - Doo-doo , ca-ca , poo-poo . - Go brush your hair , Michael Bolton . There 's a hole in their security . I 've got it all figured out . But there 's nothing worth hearing in there until tomorrow , when they unveil their new assassination technology . Again with the assassination technology , hmm ? I need to get in there , Jimmy . I need to know what 's happening in there today . If you can really get in there , prove it . [ Man ] Real-world application will always , always remain a necessary component of weapons testing . And obviously , a weapon can 't be fielded , can 't be put into the arsenal , until its efficacy in combat can be established . Now , if you 'll take a look at the kill / ratio productivity chart ... we 've provided for you . Turn to- - On page 22 there , you 'll see that- - Ooh . There 's your fascist chickie , Byers . [ Man Continues , Indistinct ] Timmy ? - Damn . - [ Thud ] [ Yelling ] Hold on ! Hold on ! What the hell is going on ? You 're one of them . You really screwed things up , Jimmy . - We had big plans for you . - What big plans ? Political assassination . I was right . I was right about the whole thing ! Every good plan needs a patsy . No ! - Can you take these up , please ? - Sure . - Agent Scully . - Where 's Agent Mulder ? - I 've been trying to call him . - Uh- - He 's , uh- - I think his phone 's messed up . He may be hard to reach for the next few hours . He suggested we work with you . Bring you up to speed . By all means , bring me up to speed . - Who 's the injured party ? - Subject 's name is James Belmont . Over . - This way . - Oh , man . Jimmy . We 're crossing the lobby now . He got hit ! Look ! Over there ! He just jumped . No warning . No nothing . He just dived right out in front of me . Oh , God . It is Jimmy . It 's not my fault . He was just standing there , and then he just dives under the bus . - This wasn 't a suicide . - You know this man ? What 's going on here ? [ Knocking On Door ] Susanne . Do you remember me ? John , what are you doing here ? - I 'm here to save you . - From what ? I don 't think you are yourself . I think that , uh , you 've been mistreated ... and confused and- - I 'm afraid that your beliefs , your opinions are no longer your own . As in " " I 've been brainwashed " ? I don 't know what to tell you . I haven 't been . Your life may be in danger , Susanne . A friend of mine has just been killed . - Murdered . - What ? - And that man that you 're with- - - My fiance ? - I 'm sorry , John . I-I think you better go . - No , wait , wait . Ten years ago , I saw you thrown into a car . Kidnapped right in front of me . Did that not happen ? Did I just dream all of that ? It happened . But things got better . - [ Gasps ] - Whoops . Sorry , buddy . That Susanne 's a popular girl . You 're absolutely sure you want to be here for this ? Oh , yeah . I 'm cool . Let 's just find out what killed him . Okay . James Belmont . Age 29 . Visual exam reveals injuries ... consistent with massive trauma . Multiple rib fractures with concomitant hemorrhaging , both internal and external . - The spine is fractured and partially exposed . - Um- - What if they did something to him , you know , to make him pancake himself ? Who 's " " they " ? You know , " " them . " I 'll begin with the " " Y " incision . Langly , will you go over there and pass me the Stryker saw , please ? It 's right there on the counter . Thank you . [ Vomiting ] Are you okay , Langly ? [ Gasps ] [ Vomiting , Coughing ] - [ Surgical Instrument Hits Floor ] - Scully ? Scully , wake up . - Are you okay ? - What happened ? I 'm thinking that you got a little queasy and took a header . You know , blood and guts can bother some people . Yeah . I guess . You gonna be all right ? Sure , cutie . So , you 're done with Jimmy ? Done , done , done . How do you roll this thing ? Uh , Scully ? What killed him ? My medical opinion- - Beep ! And that 's all you found ? That 's all I know . Scully ? - What did you find out ? - Autopsy was negatory . - Jimmy squished himself . - And where is the scrumptious Agent Scully ? She said she had something important to do . Man , she is seriously jet-lagged . - You got product already ? - No . An earlier bird got the worm . All this waiting . I feel like they 're keeping tabs on us , watching us . [ Grant ] Honey , you worry too much . The plan is still on schedule . Everything 's falling into place . We 've worked so long and so hard for this . It 's not her . They 're making her do this somehow . Buddy , now , I know something about the fairer sex , trust me . You can bring a horse to water , but you can 't make her drink . She would not marry that man . You don 't know him like I do . How 'd you get in here ? One of you left this in my room . Grant Ellis saved my life . He saved the lives of thousands . - [ Scoffs ] - I need to talk to you , John . I need to try and explain everything . Come on . Let 's hit the slots . Watch your back . Mata Hari . You said something about a friend being murdered . - [ Door Closes ] - Not that I can prove it . But I think he saw something he was not supposed to see at your conference . - You may be in danger . - I am always . So is Grant . I have thought about this moment so many times . All the things I would say to you if I ever saw you again . And then there you were at my door , and I- - They took me ten years ago . They did things to me . And it was like drowning every day underwater , struggling to breathe . And one day a hand broke the surface , reached down and pulled me up . I wanted it to be you , John . It was Grant . He worked for them- - the project . I didn 't trust him , not for years , not until I realized that he was working against them in his own way . Stalling them , sabotaging their tests . He reminded me of you . - They 're just lucky I got a conscience . - How 's that ? If I unleash my true kung fu on this casino , I could break the bank within a week . Yeah , and find yourself buried under six feet of desert dirt . - Hey , guys . - Hey , Timmy . I 'm sorry aboutJimmy . Hey , Langly ? The guys are all up in my room for a round of Dungeons and Dragons ... in honor ofJimmy . Lord Manhammer will be in attendance . I 'm gonna go play a little DD in memoriam . That 's touching , man . [ Woman Laughing Loudly ] - [ Laughter Continues ] - You like penthouses ? - Scully ? - Oh ! Hey , Hickey . Long time no see . - [ Whispering ] - No , that 's not nice . I like Hickey . Cigarette ? You don 't smoke . But who 's got a match ? Well ... I just can 't decide who lights my fire . That 's it . All right , you dandies , back off . This is Special Agent Dana Scully of the F.B.I. If you so much as touch her , you may be committing a federal offense . Come on . Come on . We could have been stardust . - Maybe next time . - [ Slaps Bottom ] Ooh . I hope you brought your wallet , my friend . Just because this is a memorial game- - - What 's this ? - Oh , we have got a game for you . Trust me . This is gonna work . - You didn 't tape this ? - No . Which means they surveilled us . They know our plans . They know everything . - What is your plan ? - To escape . This conference was our chance to slip out on the last day- - go public with our files , all our weapons research . [ Sighs ] We could finally make it happen this time . We 'd gathered up enough proof . The public is ready to believe now more than ever . They know everything . They 'll kill us , John- - Grant and me both . - [ Laughing ] Hi ! - Come on . Come on . - Come on . Settle down . Settle down . - Okay , okay , okay . I found Agent Scully Go-Lightly holding court in the bar . I 've never seen her drunk before . God . This can 't be . - [ Chuckles ] Hi . - Please . She 's not drunk . Look at this . That was made by an injector gun . What the hell was she injected with ? It 's a derivative of E-H gas . A-H . Anoetic histamine . My latest creation . I could have developed it years ago , but I held off . I wasn 't about to let those bastards I work for get their hands on it . Grant thought that if we secretly developed a small batch ... and then destroyed the notes , we would have the proof we needed to go public . We 'd also have a weapon we could use against them . Who else has access to this anoetic histamine ? Grant and I are the only two people that have- - that have the samples . This will counteract the anoetic effect . Hey , cutie . Ow ! Just a little prick . - Bad trip ? - She 'll be fine . - She just needs to sleep it off . - I don 't understand . Why would the government want to turn Scully into a bimbo ? That 's just a potential side effect . Anoetic histamine impedes higher brain functions . It promotes suggestibility . Mind control . Brainwashing . That explains Jimmy . They told him to commit suicide . And Scully . They made her forget her autopsy findings . But what is their larger purpose ? What are they planning ? Well , whatever it is , we better find out fast . [ Knocking On Door ] Right on time . This is your weapon . All you do is pull the trigger . You will enter the Saguaro Room at 1 0 : 05 a.m. This badge will give you access . Take a seat toward the back and wait . At 1 0 : 1 5 , a break will be called . Rise , approach the target , and fire three shots . This brings us to the notion of acceptable risk . Of course , risk is defined as exposure ... during both utilization and post-project evaluation . Now , in a secure proving ground , i.e. , a domestic engagement , we have had great success . Now , offshore utilizations ... can afford a more comprehensive definition ... of acceptable risk . Proper target appraisal can provide ... a risk-free trial environment . A combination of political instability and lack of efficient infrastructure ... can offer a target area of nearly ... zero risk-potential . - Authorized attendees only . - I 'm an F.B.I. agent . Authorized attendees . Of course , risk management goes hand in hand ... with operational preparedness . - That happens to be our topic for the remainder of this session . - Al ? - Huh ? - I think this would be a good time to take a break . - Shall we ? - Oh . Yeah . Let 's take five , everybody . Smoke ' em if you got ' em . Oh , my God . - [ Chattering , Shouting ] - [ Man ] Somebody help her ! - Susanne . - Federal agent . Call for help . We 're in the Saguaro Room . We need an ambulance . A woman 's been shot . - She 's bleeding . Hurry . - We 're on our way . Who did this ? Who did this ? The shooter got away . Detain this man . Get him out of here . Let 's go . Good work , party girl . I 'll take him from here . Wait a minute . Where are you taking me ? [ Knocking On Door ] Susanne ? Could we have a moment alone , please ? - I 'll be fine . - We 'll be right down the hall . Okay . Thanks for the tip . Big surprise , huh ? Since you programmed my friend to kill me ? No , Susanne . It wasn 't my idea . You knew about it . You gave it to them- - the A-H . If I hadn 't thought to check Langly- - If I hadn 't given him the antidote- - I don 't understand . Why save me ? - Why save my life just to take it away ? - You know why . You were done with me . You had what you wanted . They had what they wanted . The project was over . Honest to God , it wasn 't my idea . All those years you spent gaining my trust . You pretended that you loved me . What could they possibly give you for that ? What was it worth to you , Grant ? What was your price ? What did you get ? My life . They 'd kill me . [ Door Closes ] Hello . I 'm so sorry , Susanne . The county death records first . Then the state tax rolls . Come on . - Then the Clark County Morgue . List they misplaced the body . - [ Speaking German ] Why don 't you just zap me with your girlie 's thing there and brainwash me again ? I say do it . Then we can make him cut his hair . - [ Knock At Door ] - Will you answer that ? Why me ? She 's your little chickadee . Hurry up . Come on . Come on in , Mata Hari . C.I.A. Freeze . - Let her go . - Sure . No ! You know the best thing about killing you three ? - I won 't have to dress like you anymore . - [ Injector Gun Fires ] [ Groans ] Get him off me . Hi , cutie . What do you want to do with him ? Police confirm an arrest has been made . This man- - Timothy Landau of Alamogordo , New Mexico- - has confessed to the murders of Grant Ellis and Susanne Modeski . Hello ? Mulder ? Can you hear me ? I 'm at the hotel . Where are you ? What do you mean , " " What hotel " ? Las Vegas . I 'm in Las Vegas . Aren 't you ? You called me . What do you mean , you didn 't call me ? Oh , man . I am gonna kick their asses . Susanne Modeski is dead . Every computer at every county , state and federal office knows it . This is who you are now . Come with me . You 'll be safer without me . Doesn 't make a difference . I told you , I 'm going public . No , you 're not . You 've done more than enough . Leave it to us now . It 's what we do . This was meant for Grant . I want you to have it . Someday . So , you want to hit the slots ? You know , Byers , growing old with us ain 't so bad . Oh , shut up , Langly . Do you really want him to kill himself ? Got any quarters ? [ Child ] I made this !

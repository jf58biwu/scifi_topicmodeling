What else am I going to say ? We need the business . You-you know , that 's another thing . We 've never catered before , partner . Well , you never know until you try , now , do you ? DRIVER : Hey , I need help unloading these chairs . I got to be across town in a half an hour . Is it my fault you 're two hours late ? If you know someplace else you can get 150 little gold chairs , then you be my guest . Look , man , I 'm , I 'm really sorry , pal . You-you just should have told me , that 's all . I know , I know . I was trying to protect you . Well , I don 't need your protection , thank you . Look , the bad news is , your high school sweetheart 's getting married . The good news is , you 're catering her wedding . It wasn 't just high school . Oh , that 's right . I forgot . You two moved here together so you could go to college . And then she dumped you because ... Don 't even get into that . She didn 't dump me . We ... It was mutual . Right . Just like Marcia . ( knocking ) No , it 's not like Marcia . Marcia and I were married . Genie and I , we just ... We-we split up , that 's all . Hey , and who 's this Stanford fella , anyway ? Stan Stanford . Stan ... Stan Stanford ? Yeah . You believe that dumb jock who would do his physics papers on hockey pucks is now president and founder of Offside Software , the hottest commodities trading software on the market ?

Please don 't even start , Scott . I will have a breakdown . Mrs. Berlatski . Oh , that must be the caterer . We have to add another eight for the reception . Gary ! It 's wonderful your being here to help at the last minute . I didn 't know if you 'd be able to come in person . Oh , well ... Everything all right in here , Mrs. Berlatski ? Yes , thank you ... Inspector . Well , what 's , uh , with the , uh , security ? Alex is testifying at one of those RICO hearings . My husband , the hero . Genie did not want him to do it because of the wedding . But you know Alex . They 've been hiding him in some hideous hotel for the past three weeks . Oh . ( clears throat ) Well , will Mr. Berlatski be at the , uh , the wedding ? He 'll be so happy to see you , Gary . I 'll , I 'll be very happy to see him . Isn 't it something , Genie getting married ? Yeah . Finally . Yeah . I 'm sure she 'll be very happy . You know , Alex and I always thought ... we always hoped that it would be you walking Genie down the aisle . You were so good for her . Well , Genie 's ... Gee , Mrs. Berlatski , you know , I should call the restaurant and let them know that we have eight extra guests coming . Um , I 'll , I 'll talk to you soon . Good . Okay . Yes . Yeah , the , uh , phone would be down this way . Gary ! Hi ! Another eight ? Oh , sure . No problem . I 'll tell Gorin . Um ...

I was , uh , I was just using the phone . I hope you don 't mind . Oh . Oh , here 's your pen . Thank you . Thank you . Genie ? Gary ! How are you ? How are you ? Fine . How are you doing ? Good to see you . Oh , it 's good to see you , too . Uh , I didn 't think you were going to be able to come by . Chuck said that you 've been so busy . Uh , Chuck overstates things a little bit . Look , uh , every caterer in town was booked . I hope you don 't mind doing this . Of course not . You really don 't mind ? No , I don 't mind . Good . I 'm very happy for you . Any closer , you two guys could sell tickets for this . Stan . Isn 't this wonderful , sweetie ? Gary 's here . Oh , absolutely . Stan . Congratulations . You did good . Oh , I guess I would have to agree with you on that . MRS. BERLATSKI : Isn 't this sweet ? It 's your own little reunion , sweetheart . Stan , I just realized something awful . We haven 't arranged for anybody to pick up your Uncle Bob tomorrow at the train station . Oh , that 's terrific . Honey , send a limo . Genie , I haven 't seen the man in 20 years . Okay ? He 's my only relative coming to the wedding . I 'd pick him up myself , but I-I have to be at the hairdresser . And we have got the photographer at , uh ... 11 : 00 . I 'll go pick him up . That is so thoughtful of you , Gary . GENIE : Thank you . That 's very nice . Well , it 's nothing . You 're a prince , Gary . But then I guess you do have a lot of free time on your hands . I 'm sure that Gary has a lot of important things to attend to . Actually , I need to get the final guest list ... Oh ! ... so we can go over it . ( quiet chatter ) ( sighing ) Great . And you 're sure this catering business of yours , this isn 't interfering with the restaurant ? Gare , look , I know you 're new to the restaurant game , okay ? I know what I 'm doing . The wedding reception is 150 people and is a captive audience . Now , I guess the , uh , bride - and groom-to-be are gonna show up here , huh ? ( makes popping sound ) They 're bringing by the guest list and Genie wants to see the , uh ... restaurant . Well , not only is she getting married , but she 's , uh , rubbing your face in it . Let me tell you something ... Gary , great place . Genie ! Hey , here 's the list . Thanks , Stan . It 's a nice suit . You look sharp . Uh , can I get you a drink ? No , thank you . Wow . I love this place . Huh . Very impressive list . GARY : Oh , this is the kitchen , obviously , and that back there is where we put the office . Oh . And where they 're preparing the food for tomorrow . Looks good . Hey , uh ... what happened with your dad ? Oh , well , his accounting firm was doing the books for this big construction union , and he caught them dipping into the pension funds . So ... He keeps telling me all the security isn 't necessary , but I think he 's just trying to make me feel better . Thank you . Well , I 'm sure everything 's gonna be fine . Yeah , I 'm sure he will . So , Chuck said you live upstairs . Is that right ? Yeah , upstairs . Live upstairs . Do you want to see ? Yeah , I really would . This is it . Your basic bachelor pad ? Well , yeah . Well , no , it 's not ... You know , occasionally . Wow . Wow , it 's really great . My place is like a total archeological dig . And I still have all those letters you wrote me , from , like , ten years ago . You 're kidding . They were so beautiful , Gary . I couldn 't just throw them away . Well , you 're getting married , you know ... Yeah . Stan- - I love Stan . Well , Stan 's a good guy . Yeah . But , uh , he 's not exactly the romantic type . And a girl needs a little romance every once in a while . Even if it is just from an old letter . Well , yeah , you know , those letters that I wrote , they , uh ... You loved me so much . Yeah , I did , but that was a long time ago . I used to think maybe we made a mistake breaking up . But we were too much alike . Neither one of us knew where we were going . Well , we were 19 years old . Well , you know what I mean . Stan is so together . And I actually finally feel like I have a sense of direction . But I just wish- - Your letters , Gary ... I practically memorized them . Well , th-that 's flattering . " I 'll be around in the dark . " Huh ? " I 'll be everywhere , wherever you look . " It was so powerful , you know . You know , Hen ... ( clears throat ) Henry Fonda said that and-and-and John Steinbeck wrote that . I didn 't write that . I knew that . Oh . Well , so let 's go downstairs , huh ? CHUCK : Stevie Unger . Don 't tell me . He 's working on a cure for cancer . Diabetes . Genie , honey , I 'm sorry . Turns out , I am gonna have to go back to the office . I 'll drop you at home on the way . You promised me you weren 't gonna work tonight . I 'm sorry , honey , but I don 't have much of a choice . Chuckie , I 'm counting on you , man . Don 't short me on those hors d 'oeuvres . Whatever you say , Stanley . Bye , Gary . I always hated that guy . Huh ? Oh . ( cat meows ) ( meows ) ( sotto voce ) : No . That 's it for the main courses ! Move to the church ! Dessert team , you 're up next ! Come on , people ! We 've got a wedding in a couple of hours . " St. Stephens Church was the scene of tragedy " Saturday afternoon when assassins bullets took down " Alexander Berlatski " and his daughter Genie . " Berlatski , a protected witness set to testify " against corruption in the construction business , came out " of seclusion in order to attend his daughter 's wedding . " Earlier this week , Berlatski said , " ' In spite of the personal risk , I believe the state " ' deserves an honest " ' and accountable construction industry . " ' I will do everything in my power to see that " the wrongs of the past are corrected . ' ( gunshot ) ( woman screams ) ( gunshot , panicked screaming ) " Alex Berlatski was pronounced dead on arrival " at Chicago Hope Hospital . " His daughter is in intensive care " but is expected to survive . No charges have been filed . " So what are you gonna do ? I don 't know . I got to pick up Stan 's Uncle Bob in an hour . Uh , no , Gare , don 't look at me , okay ? I 'm a little busy here , you know ? Hey , listen to me . This , uh , this mad Bulgarian Gorin 's got everything taken care of here . This is important , you understand ? Hey , it 's bad enough that Stan 's looking down his nose at me 'cause I 'm a caterer . Now I got to be his car service , too ? No way , Gare ! I don 't think so ! MAN : Taxi ! Shagin , Robert , Colonel . Fishman , Chuck , Caterer . We got a wedding to get to . My pleasure . ( grunts ) Right over here . What did you say your name was ? Hobson . Gary Hobson . Look , I 'm not accusing anybody . I 'm just saying that I saw a gun . You saw a gun in the vestry ? That 's right . We 'll check it out . Now ! I mean , I-I really think that y-you should check it out now . Yeah . It was right here . Next to the Bible ? Well , no , the Bible was over here . The-the , it was ... Hey . Steadman , now wait a second . Look , I 'm not making this up . You and the bride , you had something going on , right ? Well , yeah . You otherwise attached ? No . Look , I 'd like to see her get married . And the daddy would like that , and so would Mom . In fact , the only one who doesn 't want her to get married is Gary Hobson . Am I wrong ? Wait a second . You think I 'm doing this because I don 't want to see them get married ? Yeah , I do . You don 't understand . There 's gonna be trouble here today , big trouble . ( laughs ) No , there 's not , because I 'm here . You 're not listening , Steadman . Hey , the only trouble I 'm getting is coming from you . And that is 100 % unacceptable . Get the point ? ( church bells toll in distance ) GORIN : Garnish , people , garnish ! The guy ignored me . You accused a priest , Gary . Oh , yeah , I know . Believe me , I know . ( sighs ) Well , he didn 't totally ignore you . Our guys from the church called , and everything slowed down because Steadman had metal detectors put on the doors . We 've only got a couple of hours before the wedding . Damn . So me and my partner , we have this restaurant . Uh-huh . It 's called McGinty 's . I don 't know if you 've ever heard of it . Nope . Ah , it 's a great place- - very happening , lots of chicks . I knew a guy bought a restaurant . Steak so tender , you could cut it with a fork . Between the health department and the IRS , he went belly-up inside a year . Oh . Blew his brains out in the meat locker . Poor son of a bitch . Wow , that 's , uh ... ( cell phone ringing ) that 's terrible . Excuse me . Hold on for a second . ( phone beeps on ) Hello . GARY : Chuck . I 'm telling you , I think this Father Mark 's in on it , but I need proof . You kidding ? Chuck , I need time . Stan 's not gonna start the ceremony until his Uncle Bob shows up . So what you got to do is , you got to delay Uncle Bob . How ? Just do it ! I don 't know how you 're gonna do it . Just do it . Just ... take the Van Buren Street Bridge . ( car horns honking ) What the hell is going on ? You got a problem , General ? ! You 're damn right I do ! Well , why don 't you get off your fat butt and help me pick it up , then ? ! WOMAN : Go ! Move it ! This guy 's a menace . ( grumbling ) Now I got to deal with G.I. Joe with a attitude here . ( horn honking ) Oh , come on , let 's go ! Here you go . ( phone ringing ) ( door closes in distance ) ( phone continues ringing ) Yes ? MAN : The drop is at 12 : 30 . We do the drop at 12 : 30 . 1200 Lakeshore Drive . 1200 Lakeshore Drive . God bless you , Father . God bless you , too . ( door closes in distance ) I want them set up all over the church . You got it . Steadman . Listen , I got to talk to you . Let me guess . The priest is acting suspicious again . Oh , yes , he is . Get a date . Huh ? Get a life . Get ... out . No , no , no . Steadman , you don 't understand . Nick . You don 't- - Steadman , you don 't understand ! Excuse me . Stead- - no . Steadman ! You ... ( door slamming ) Genie , Genie . Listen , Genie , I got to talk to you about this wedding . Now , there 's something that you ... What 's wrong ? Gary , I think I 'm making a terrible mistake . ( sobs quietly ) You think you , you ... ( sobbing quietly ) He was at his desk until 2 : 00 in the morning last night . Well , he works hard . But Gary , if I asked you who you were , what would you say ? ( church bell tolling ) Gary Hobson . Yeah . Stan is the president of Offside Software . He 's the junior chairman of the club . He 's the 164th richest man in Chicago . But he is hardly ever just Stan . And when he is , it 's good . Well , you wanted someone who was going somewhere , you found him . I mean , when you , you and I were together , Gary , we were just ourselves , weren 't we ? Hey , look , Genie , I mean , we-we were ... different . GENIE : Well , you 've known me since we were kids . Huh ? Am I making a mistake marrying Stan ? GARY : You know what I think ? You should postpone the wedding . Really ? Yeah . You know , just-just for a few days . Just until you have time to-to , you know , think things through a little bit . You really think so ? I really think it would be better for everybody . I think you should postpone the wedding . I-I-I-I-I-I , I really think so . I really do . ( murmured conversation ) FATHER MARK : All right . Do whatever you can . ( murmuring ) SUIT : Good . ( metal clanking ) FATHER MARK : Did you hear that ? SUIT : I 'll get the fire escape . SUIT : I 'm gonna find him . CHUCK : Yeah , so we watch our overhead . We keep it low . ( horns honking ) Find the right market niche , you know ? I mean , there 's also the franchise angle . McGinty 's all over the state . Maybe even McGinty 's all over the country . It 's not gonna be a Fortune 500 company , but the growth potential is there . You know what I mean ? Sure , sure . Like uh , Martha Stewart . Exactly . You find your base , you become a monster , and then you expand . Bottom line is , a man 's gotta do what he 's good at . Like Joseph Campbell . Follow your bliss . It 's clear . It is . The traffic , it 's clear . Let 's go . Move it . Oh , oh , yeah . Okay , let 's go . Let 's go ! Right . Would you , would you like another sandwich to go ? I 'm full . Move it . Come on . Okay . No problem . Maybe a soda or something ? We 're late . Oh , all right . COMPUTER VOICE : Chicago diocese employment records . Enter search terms . I can 't believe you 're making me hack into the diocese files . It 's like breaking into church , Gary . Well , this is very important . I know , I know . Uh-oh . What ? Hey , Stan , what are you doing here ? You told Genie she should postpone the wedding , didn 't you ? Now , look , Stan , this is for your own good . You gotta believe me . You don 't know what 's good for us . Why are you meddling in our lives ? What gives you the right ? Stan , what if I told you there was gonna be a shooting . Oh , yeah . Steadman told me about that ploy . This is pretty desperate , Gary . I mean , you really want Genie that badly ? Stan , I don 't want Genie . I want you to be married and very happy . Well , you certainly have a bizarre way of showing that . Now , Stan , if you could just put off this wedding for a couple of days . Just let everything cool down . I don 't want to cool down . I love her , and I want to marry her . And you will . Today . I have been working my ass off for ten years , Gary , to become the kind of guy that Genie would want to marry . So this wedding is gonna happen , and if you try and stop it , I swear to God ... I guess she 's still got a thing for you , Gary . I don 't know if it 's me or cold feet . Well , here are the " R 's . " There 's uh , Ritkes , Rivera ... Rossignuolo . No Romanow . Guess you 're right . Father Mark isn 't who he says he is . I gotta get Inspector Steadman to pay attention , Marissa . Well , has the headline changed ? No , it 's the same ... Marissa . What ? The traffic jam story 's gone . What does it say ? " Traffic Accident Kills Restauranteur . " A traffic accident at the corner of Hutchings and 7th " took the life of Chuck Fishman at 1 : 07 p.m. yesterday , " when a large truck lost control of its brakes " and collided with Fishman 's car . " Gary Hobson , Fishman 's business partner " said , ' Chicago has lost a fine citizen . I 've lost my best friend . ' " Listen to me . You get Chuck on the cell phone , all right ? Come on , Chuck , answer the phone . MALE VOICE : Cellular phone services temporarily unavailable . Please try your ... It 's five after 1 : 00 . Can 't you take a side street , or something ? Will you relax ? The wedding will never start on time , not with all that security . What ? A couple of U.S. marshals ? Please . Are you nuts ? It 's like the Pope is in town . They 're checking everybody 's IDs . Plus , you have to go through a metal detector . Damn . What ? I forgot to pick up Stan 's gift . What the hell was I thinking ? Well , by all means , let 's stop and get those crazy kids their present . Stop the car . Here . I 'll call the store . All right . Uh , take your time , Colonel Bob . There 's no rush . Seven after . CHUCK : Here we are . One of Chicago 's finer department stores . Is this it ? Thanks a lot . Ah . Okay ? Thanks for your help , Chuck . That 's my mission , Colonel Uncle Bob .

You all right ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Look , you were in the paper . I don 't have time to explain . Oh , look here , it 's Cinderella and his ugly step-sister .

We have Berlatski on standby . What 's the holdup ? We can 't start without Uncle Bob . We have a relative situation . STEADMAN : Stand by . CAROL : Gary , finally . And you must be Uncle Bob . Ah , yes . I 'm sorry I 'm late . It 's a pleasure to meet you . How sweet . Steadman . STEADMAN : Station B , proceed Berlatski to the church . Hey , listen , listen to me . I , I got proof that Father Mark 's a fake . The girl is getting married . Give it up . Here 's a printout from the diocese of all the priests in the Chicago area . There is no Father Mark Romanow . Come on . This man is delusional . Delusional ? Huh . I 'm telling you , I saw the gun in that drawer . I also saw this guy over at the water tower with two other guys that also had guns . And when they got done talking , they started chasing me around . I uh , think this is what you 're looking for . FBI Special Agent Romanow . STEADMAN : No way . FATHER MARK : Way . ( clears throat ) What about the water tower ? What about it ? All right , pal , what about the package you 're handing back and forth , huh ? None of your business . It 's my business . It was wedding invitations . I wanted two guys undercover in the guests . Hey , this is my case . Berlatski is my witness . Oh , yeah , you guys have some record protecting witnesses . Oh , what the hell is that supposed to mean ? Hey , guys , you gonna stop this wedding , or you want me to do it myself , huh ? Your boogeyman is a fed . You just ran out of excuses , okay ? Two agencies of the federal government are gonna make sure this girl gets married safe and sound . And ... And you take one step inside that church , and you are going directly to jail . For what ? For being pathetic . STEADMAN : Now , get lost . GARY : Listen , let me tell you something . GARY : If you think that I 'm gonna ... STEADMAN : No , you don 't tell me anything . You just keep ... Okay ... GARY : Mr. Berlatski ... Mr. Berlatski ! What did I tell you ? You are gone . Station A , you have a go . ( organ playing " Wedding March " ) CHUCK : Gary ! Hey ! Oh , man , you are not gonna believe what happened to me today . It 's been one disaster after ... What 's wrong with you ? They wouldn 't listen to me . Who ? What do you mean who ? I 'll tell you who . Half the ... What ? GARY : " 20 Dead In Bomb Blast . " CHUCK : Oh , no . " Major explosion tore through " St. Stephen 's Church yesterday . " Survivors report that the explosion occurred just as the couple were declared husband and wife . " ( " Wedding March " playing ) Sit . I think I know where the bomb is . And you were the delivery boy . No . I 'm telling you , the man is a cold-blooded assassin . I was taking career advice from a professional killer . Uncle Bob ? Yeah . Why do you think I was so late , huh ? When the cops pulled me over to fill out the accident report , they found a gun in my car . It took me a half an hour to explain to him that it wasn 't my gun . Who else was in the car besides me ? Uncle Bob . Dearly beloved , we are gathered here today to celebrate the unity of Genie and Stan . That gift he arranged to pick up , Gare , it had to be the bomb . So nobody knew what Uncle Bob looked like , so they-they replaced Uncle Bob with a hit man . I delivered a bomb . CHUCK : It had to have been his gun . FATHER KEIR : Christ abundantly blesses this love . He has already consecrated you in baptism . And now , He enriches and strengthens you by a special sacrament , so that you may assume the duties of marriage in mutual and lasting fidelity . Since it is your intention to enter into marriage , join your right hands and declare your consent before God and His church . A bomb ? Yeah . In the church ? In a wedding gift ? That 's right . And you know this because ... ? Look , because ... We have our sources . Yeah . Oh . Does your source have a name ? Well ... We can 't disclose that presently . No . Oh , okay , I understand . Hobson , I 'm gonna take care of you . Thank you very much . DiMaio ! Now , listen , this Uncle Bob , whoever he is , he 's gonna try to escape before the bomb goes off , so you might want to have someone look around . He says one more word , protective custody . Thank you . Wait a minute ! The man is trying to tell ... Both of them . Heads up . I want another face check of that crowd . You 're looking for known offenders . FATHER KEIR : Stan and Genie , have you come here freely and without reservation to give yourselves to each other in marriage ? Yes . ( clearing throat ) ( whispering ) : I really do need an answer . Yes . All right , let 's go , fellas . FATHER KEIR : Do you , Stan , take Genie to be your wife ? To have and to hold , from this day forward , for better or for worse ... Yes , I do , Father . Well , I haven 't quite gotten there yet . Do you , Genie , take Stan to be your husband ? CHUCK : Okay , hold it steady . Keep it straight . Uh , we 're the , uh , caterers . ID . That 's a beautiful ensemble you 've got on . The stripes and , uh ... Okay , fellas , let 's go . All right , you know what to do . You know where to take it . You know where to go . Stay . What do you mean , " stay " ? Hey , wait a minute . My company ! I 'm the boss ! May the Lord bless these rings ( Uncle Bob coughing ) which you give to each other as a sign of your enduring love . ( coughing ) Excuse me . ( coughing ) STAN : Genie , take this ring as a sign of my enduring love . CHUCK : Hey ! It 's him ! ( gun cocking ) FATHER MARK : I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Been waiting for you , Eldridge . ( Chuck gasping for air ) CHUCK : Thank you , Father . And now , by the powers vested in me by the church and the state of Illinois ... GARY : Everybody ! Everybody out of the church ! There 's a bomb ! Everybody out ! No . No ! No ! GARY : Out of the church ! GARY : Where 's Uncle Bob ? Where was he sitting ? Over there . ( panicked screaming ) Freeze ! Listen , Steadman , you have got to believe me . There 's a bomb in one of these packages . Right , Hobson . Open it up . ( clattering ) All right , all right . STEADMAN : LeFevre , listen up . In case there really is a bomb here , you have to clear the street , hold the traffic and find me a containment site . Yes , sir . All right , it 's , it 's got to be in one of these . Steadman ... ( timer beeping ) your turn . Holy Mother of ... Open the door now . Open the door ! ( grunting ) STEADMAN : Get back !

My courage strengthened by the faith that my words have at last found a way to reach you .

That she will use her position to help us . And although I have been warned against her , I want to believe her . I want so much to find someone else in this frightened world I can trust ... as I have come to trust a man who saved my life here . Another soldier who hates the world Santiago has created as I do . He 's a brave and resourceful man ... but still a mystery to me in many ways . He does not admit it , but it 's clear to me now that he does not seek to return home . His reasons he keeps to himself . I will come home , Sophie . You are my light . My star . My one true path through two worlds . Keep these words deep in your heart , my darling . I will fight my war . I will come home . I 'm sorry . I followed you . How long have you been waiting here ? Since , um ... a long time . - I was afraid I 'd miss you . - You 're freezing cold . I need to know about Tom , if you were able to reach him ? I 'm sorry . We must keep trying . [ Crying ] [ Voices Overlapping ] [ Child ] I made this ! Ripped By mstoll

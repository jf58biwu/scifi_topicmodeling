It 's like a nerd , is not it ? Come on . There are many chemical compounds , but we managed to identify the dominant depending on molecular structure . And what conclusion did you get ? The fragrance that 's full of pheromones . Pheromones ? Afrodiziac natural . Yes . It is usually found in sweat glands . But that ... Those are synthetic . If Gua have figured out how to synthesize pheromones ... it could be ... Elixir of Love . This means that Dad is not responsible for his actions . You 're right . Nick , you 're absolutely right . I gotta get back to work . Okay . I 've been thinking ... I 'm ready to take this relationship further . You do not seem too happy about it .

I called ... I called ... " hidden brain " " Hidden brain " ... I think it 's not so bad . So , come on Eddie , fits something quatrains ? Yes , yes . Listen to this ... Good . When Jezebel into town , her footsteps shook the foundations . With its flower poisonous , it apart steel chains . What Michelle apart are innocent families . A Chinese philosopher said ... A base kingdom is the state , and the state is based on a family . So if we destroy families Gua ... They do not need weapons of mass destruction . Yes , if Michelle 's plan applies throughout the country . Okay , thank you Eddie . And now what ? Follow Michelle to stop it hurting everyone in the neighborhood . What you through this lab , Nick ? Nick ? I came home , my son . Dad came home in the middle of the day . Come down , we need to talk . I am coming . Hold on . Leave me to go . - But my dad . - Stay here . What are you doing here ? Need to talk to Mr. Patterson . Where is my son ? E thereof . Put the gun down . We must ask you to leave , Mr. Banks . I want to talk to Nick in particular . I can not do this . Pardon ? We know what happens between you and Michelle . And also know it 's not your fault Are you sleeping with her ? Dad ? What are you doing with a gun ? It 's coming you , Mr. Patterson . Use a chemical that makes it impossible to refuse . - You 're a liar . - It is not . Tell the truth . Michelle tries to make all the men in the neighborhood to do bad things . And why should I believe him . I do not care if you believe it . I want to believe me . Father , please . Put the gun down . He wanted to kill you . Still I want my boyfriend . I felt that you needed encouragement . It seems that I was right . Maybe you need more of that . Ah , handsome stranger . How nice of you to return what you stole . Michelle , what are you doing ? Well Ron , it 's time to end . Kill them both . Ron ? Need a little inspiration . - What you put in it ? - Acid . Do you like hydrochloric acid ? - Shoot her ! - Dad , shoot it . I can not . I can . What 's this ? This was an alien . Nick will not lie . Your son saw an alien . And now you have seen them . You mean perfume forced you to do ? Exact . And what should we do now ? I know it sounds crazy , but you have to tell them who was actually Michelle . It 's the only way to get rid of them . No one will ever believe it . I know . What made you go back , Mom . In 18 years of marriage , I never ran an argument . I 'm going to do now . I managed to made an agreement with the parents . I 'm going to contest the science , if they go to the counselor . Stay with her Nick , are good people . I care about you . Yes , I know . I read all this in your stories ? You can be sure . Nobody thought that Nick saw an alien . Neither his parents nor the police . As we grow , cease to believe in the monster under the bed . Thank God that Nick thought . If my stories have created a follower , means it will be the second , and third . And one day , a court will have to listen ... I live for the day . Does Your . Da , you . Come here . I decided to trust you . Want to know what 's going on ? Da . That girl next door , Michelle ... It has a lot of men . She seduces ... With her perfume . It smells really bad . They give him all the time . - Is that so ? - Yes ... and after that , the mailman ... That idiot ... Brings . And he is one of them . One of whom ? Of aliens . How did you ... You must keep your eyes open . You know what i mean ? Finally I learned a lesson from inquisitive neighbor ... You must keep your eyes open ... And to think .

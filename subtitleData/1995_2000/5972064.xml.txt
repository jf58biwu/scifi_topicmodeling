 Here you go . Yes ! My X-Ray glasses ! Look out , women of Rutherford . From now on , Dick Solomon no longer has to use his imagination . Nina , you 're supposed to be naked . I 'm wearing my lead teddy . - Damn ! When they found him , he was completely devoured by woodland creatures . Guess what came . Oh , it 's from the friedhoffer foundation ! - Oh ! - Well ? I got it ! They accepted my application ! - I 'm going to Borneo ! - What 's so great about Borneo ? Oh , Dick , this is a tremendous opportunity .. a chance to really study , to immerse myself in a primitive culture . Congratulations , Mary . I myself could never live in the wild . I 've got to rub this in Dr. Erdman 's face . Let 's go to the faculty lounge and just let it slip out accidentally . Bring the letter . I 'll set , you spike . Oh , Borneo . How wonderful for her . She could use a weekend away . Oh , Dr. Solomon , she 's going to be going for a year . A year ? She can 't go away for a year . We 're in a relationship . We just bought a fondue pot together . We 've got plans . Well , it 's going to take a lot more than hot cheese to keep her here . You 're going to have to make a bigger commitment . You mean , like an electric wok ? I mean like a marriage proposal . Oh . You may be on to something . If she was my wife , she 'd be so busy cooking and doing chores , she 'd have no time for Borneo . So here 's something interesting . I 've decided to ask Dr. Albright to marry me . What do you think ? - That 's a terrible idea ! - Don 't be an idiot ! Great , then it 's settled . You can 't marry her . You 're not even the same species . She doesn 't know that . As far as she knows , I 'm like everybody else . Eventually she 'd figure out you 're not like everybody else , and then she and I would have to go for a little " walk . " - You wouldn 't . - Sure , Dick , of course I wouldn 't . Fine , she 's never going to find out . I 'm not going to let her find out . Oh well that 's good . You can base your entire marriage on one horrible , gigantic lie . Well , for a start . Ooh . I dropped my toast point . No ... . allow me , my petit fromage . Ow , ow , ow ! It 's hot , extremely hot ! Champagne ? Mary ... there comes a time in every woman 's life when she has to decide whether or not to go to Borneo . Dick ? I 've already made my decision . - And that decision was ? - To go to Borneo . Oh , right . Right . Mary ... there 's something I have to ask you . I may not be a rich man , I may not be a young man , I may not be a fireman , but I am a man who cares about you very deeply , and I can 't bear the thought of you ... going away for a whole year . It 's going to be hard for me , too . Then why did you apply for this Borneo trip in the first place ? I applied before we were ... - sleeping together ? - No , we were sleeping together . I just wasn 't sure if we were serious . Have you ever slept with someone you weren 't serious about ? No . The point is , we are . - Sleeping together ? - Serious . I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you about this sooner , because there shouldn 't be any secrets between us . Well , maybe a few secrets - just to keep things interesting . - Ooh , no , because a relationship is built on honesty . Ok look , I 'll let you have five little secrets if you can let me have one really big one . No , Dick , it doesn 't work that way . And , besides , sooner or later , we 'll find out everything about each other . Was there something you were going to say ? Mary ? .. Promise me if Sally ever asks you to take a little walk ... You 'll run ! The door . The door . There 's got to be a door , there 's got to be a door ! Good morning , Dr. Solomon . Good morning , Nina . Get me a cup of coffee ? Dr. Solomon , - you know why you 've been brought here ? Gentlemen . - Where are you taking me ? - To the truth room . Actually , I need to go to the bathroom . This is scary . I 'll tell you what you want to know ! I 'll tell you the truth , I promise ! Of course you will , Dr. Solomon . Please ... sit . What are you doing ? I am going to torture you until you talk . - Mary , you ? - Why do you think they call me Dr. Albright ? But first , I sing a little song I write this morning . ♪ Falling in love again ♪ ♪ never wanted to ♪ ♪ what am I to do ? ♪ ♪ Can 't help it . ♪ Oh , Dick , look at us . I know you 're keeping something from me . Please , you 're safe . You don 't have to pretend anymore . All right Mary , I 'm an alien . - That 's wonderful ! - It is ? Yes , because ... I 'm an Alien , too . No , not jell-O . Not jell-ooooo ! Run from the jell-o ! Run from the jell-o ! Dick ! What 's going on ? - Jell-o everywhere ! Get off the bed ! You 'll crush Mary ! Mary , I 'm coming ! I 'm coming to get you ! - Mary ! - Dick , calm down . There 's no Mary here . There 's no jell-O . There 's only you . I-I-I don 't know what happened . All I know is , if I had a Mommy , I 'd want her right now . Have any of you ever had your sleep invaded by scary and almost metaphorical images you can 't control ? - No . - Oh , wait ! No . Well , then what 's wrong with me ? Well , August 's uncle once had a complete mental breakdown , - and he went to a psychiatrist . - A psycho-who-a-what ? You know what a psychiatrist is . I know . I 'm just so nervous . Don , what happens to people ? Are they born bad , or one day do their minds just snap ? If only we knew , Sally . One minute , little johnny normal is on his paper route . The next minute , there 's a pile of dead bank guards , and johnny is using grandma as a human shield . So it 's true , then ? You just go to bed normal , and you wake up a deranged psychopath ? It happens . Here . Take a look at this creep , Sally . Karl Borskey , wanted for grand theft auto in Dayton , Sandusky , and Greater Wapakoneta , and now believed to be here in Rutherford . I nab this dirtbag , I make detective . This guy 's mine , all mine . But you still like girls , right , Don ? - Damn straight , sugar . - Good . Oh , no . No , no , no , it can 't be . It 's 1994 ! They 're just old magazines . Oh . For a hundred bucks an hour , you 'd think he could renew a subscription . So , why are you here , Dick ? You know , just a checkup . I thought you could give my brain a quick once-over . No biggie . - Has something been troubling you ? - Nothing , nothing at all . How about you ? You seem tense . Can I get you something ? Dick , you 're holding back . Now , anything said in this room - is absolutely confidential . - Really ? I don 't belong on this planet . I 'm an alien from another galaxy . The warranty on my brain just expired , and I 'm scared to get married ! That 's a start . At first , all Sally ever did was complain about how I forced her to become a woman , but now all the time it 's " look at my body . I am so hot . " This is your Daughter ? Sally ? No , she 's my Sister . I 'm sorry . It 's just that she 's ... 20 years younger than you . Do you think I should make her be my Daughter ? Because that 's doable . I think we 'll talk about this later Dick , the hour 's up . We have to end this session . - So , I 'm all better ? - Well , I don 't deal in a world of better . I don 't speak that language . But , no , you 're not even close to better . Right now , I 'm going to prescribe these pills . They 're called placion . - Will they grow my hair back ? - No ... although they do occasionally cause male lactation . They 'll take the edge off , help you deal with some of your anxiety . - We 'll see you next week . - All right . - So what did he do ? - Nothing . He didn 't even open up my head . He just gave me these little pills . Just as I suspected .. nothing . - Dick . - Hello , my love . I had a wonderful time last night . It made me realize that .. .. what we have . And I 've come to a decision . - I 'm not going to Borneo . - That 's too bad . - I thought you wanted me to stay . - Then stay . - Do you want me to stay or not ? - Oh , whatever . Maybe I will go to Borneo , after all . You know , Borneo , where the sun gets so hot , the dress code is naked , because if you don 't care , I don 't care . Of course I care . I love you , and I love knotty pine , and sherbet , dryer-fresh towels , and those clips that keep snack chips fresh . So when you go , I 'll have four of the five things that I love . Fine . I 'll send you a postcard . Oh , right . I love postcards , too . Hey , get me away from this wacko . - Shut up ! - Sally , what are you doing ? Look who I caught squeezing the Charmin . But Sally , that isn 't against the law . - It 's Karl Borskey . Yes , I know it 's Karl Borskey . Lock him up . Careful with those pantyhose . They 're dkny . So , Don ... you want to buy a doughnut for the gal who just made you detective ? I 'm not in the mood for doughnuts . - No doughnuts , Don ? - No . What 's wrong ? A man isn 't a man if he doesn 't have respect . Borskey should have been mine , Sally . It was just a fluke Don . If you had run out of toilet paper , you could have caught him . You know what the sick irony is , Sally ? I am out of toilet paper . - So , Harry , you got any threes ? - Go fish . - How was work today , Dick ? - Oh , just fine . - How 'd it go with Albright ? - Oh , just fine . How would it feel to have broken glass rubbed in your eyes ? - Just fine . - Dick ? Just fine . Dick , exactly what did this psychiatrist do to you ? We chatted a bit , and he put everything in order . - By the way , Sally , you 're now my Daughter . - I 'm what ? - Snap out of it . - My Sister . My Daughter . My Sister . My Daughter . My Sister and my Daughter . Tommy , do you have any nines ? - Go fish . - I don 't mind if I do . I love fish . Wait . No , Dick , you 're not actually supposed to go fishing ! Let him go . Let him go . Okay , This is scaring me . This is getting worse . - You got to call the big giant head . - No . Only the High Commander has that authority . Dick is out of commission . As second in command , I order you to call him " NOW " Okay , fine , but I 'm not broadcasting in stereo . A man 's got to have his limit .. You have reached the transmitting signal for the big giant head . All big giant 's circuits are busy right now . Please stay on the line . Oh , Donatello , you fill my life with danger and fire . Sally , - you scare-a the hell out of me . - Shut up and dance . - What is the meaning of this ? - Uh , Sally , I ... - I should have told you . - I 'm a chicken . - A chicken ? No . No ! Sì . I could never give myself to poultry . Sally , no , ... ... no . Donatello . Donatello ! How could I ? - What ? What 's wrong ? Nothing , nothing . Nothing at all . I just had a great night 's sleep . No problems here . - How would you like your bass ? - You know what ? I got to go . Uh ... there 's a big sale . Yeah , a sale on ... potatoes ! Big potato sale , potato chip sale . Stop staring at me ! Mmm , bass and potato chips . And then there were two .

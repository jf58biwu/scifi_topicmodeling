 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi My name is John Fitzgerald Byers . I was named after our 35th president . And I keep having this beautiful dream . ( girls giggling ) In my dream , the events of November 22nd , 1963 , never happened . In it , my namesake was never assassinated . Other things are different , too , in my dream . My country is hopeful and innocent ... young again . Young in spirit . My fellow citizens trust their elected oflicials , never once having been betrayed by them . My government is truly of the people , by the people , for the people . All my hopes for my country for myself all are fulHIIed . I have everything a person could want . Home and family . And love . E velything that counts for anything in life ... I have it . But the dream ends the same way every time . I lose it all . The game is Texas Hold ' Em , gentlemen . You bring your wife ? You think I 'm sitting here , I 'd bring my wife ? Dumb ass brought his wife . I 'm the man . I say I 'm playing poker , I play poker . Meanwhile , your wife is back in Plano boinking the mailman . - Hey , what was your name again ? - Funston . Stewart Funston . Hi . You bring the little lady , Stewart ? - I 'm not married . - Smart man . 100 . You guys come to this every year ? Def-Con ? Every year . Fold . - Wouldn 't miss it . - Yeah . Out ! So , you guys working on anything interesting these days ? Same old black ops crapola . You know what it 's like . We 're doing some neat stuff with neutron bombardment . You can cook somebody 's brain in their skull , like hard-boiling an egg . - it 's neat stuff . - Speaking of crapola _ _ _ Fold . - Thank you . - Oh . A man of distinction . - So , you in , Mr Funston ? - Yeah . Looks like it 's just ... you and me . Another 200 . I 'll see your 200 , and raise you one ... thousand . Ho-ho ! - He 's buying the pot , Stew . - Three clubs showing ' _ Could be a flush . 'l , OOO ... And I raise you 1,000 _ What stones he has . I see you work for Conglomerated . You guys make a great AE-135 unit . Oh , man . Don 't freak . Don 't freak . I 'm on it . AE-135 . Searching ... Bingo ! 442J / AE-135 . Air conditioning units for B-2 bombers . - Talk air conditioners . - Oh , yeah . The AE-1 35 's a beauty . Keeps the B-2s frosty . You can practically see your breath . - How did you get all the bugs out of it ? - Oh , you Know ... . - Trade secrets . - Come on , Stewart . You 're among friends . Seriously , now 'd you get past the delamination thing ? ( Langly ) Delamination . - I 'm searching . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'll see your thousand ... And ... Raise you ... all that you 've got . System test , air rates ... nothin ' . Stall him . And fold ! You wanna know how we fixed the delamination problem ? We subcontracted the whole damn thing to the Japanese , then triple-billed the government . Same thing we always do . Queen high flush . King high . AI , call security . Have ' em pick up Mr Funston here . - And his partner . - Delamination _ You made that up . My advice to you , Stewart - whatever your name really is - poker is not your game . Hey , man , you wanna thunderdome ? Let 's go ! $ 3,000 . I told you to fold . It should 've been me in there playing . - Why does Byers get to do the undercover ? - Cos this ain 't Woodstock . Did we at least get usable prints off the glasses ? What ? Are you kidding ? I had to leave them all behind . - How are we gonna salvage this ? - We 're not . This convention 's a bust . Five days and three grand invested and we got bupkes to show for it . Who was that player , anyway ? The guy who made us wasn 't wearing a convention badge . - No one said his name . - He 's worth looking into . ( knock on door ) CIA ! Open up ! Hey ! Jimmy and Timmy . Hey . Where were you guys today ? - Around . - Oh , yeah ? Snooping for some hot 411 ? - On the sneak tip ? - Maybe . - Well , maybe we were , too . - And maybe we got some . Well , maybe we did , too . We got bupkes _ Bunch of tight-lipped defence contractors . I 'm gonna go way out on a limb here and say " It 's the T-shirt . " Yeah . Maybe both of you could wear one that says " I 'm with Stupid . " You just don 't get it , man . This says that I 'm onto them . This says that I comprehend the military-industrial power dynamic . That 's what this whole thing is about . Wet works , political assassination . - That 's this year 's theme . - Where did you hear that ? Oh , yeah ! Like I 'm gonna reveal my sources . Suffice it to say there 's some big , new stealth assassination technology that 's supposed to be unveiled here . And I will be there . Front row . - For now we 're hittin ' the restaurant . - Lobster buffet . Free floor show . Plenty of boobage You guys down ? You go ahead . I 'll catch up . - You 're one hell of a sad sack , Byers . - Lay off about the poker game . No , that 's not what I 'm talkin ' about . You 're the one who pushes the hardest for us to come to these conventions . Then you get all squirrely once we get here . You 're still lookin ' for her , aren 't you ? - Susanne Moclesli _ - We met her at a convention . 10 years ago . In Baltimore . And we both know what happened to her . - Most likely , she 's dead . - No . She was a brilliant scientist . - Too important to the government . - Buddy , either way , I know we 're both hoping she 's in a better place than Las Vegas . Come on . All-you-can-eat lobster . - I almost won . - Yeah , you and everyone else . Byers , check this out . I 'm feeling lucky . - It can 't be . - What ? I 'm sorry . Byers ! What the hell 's goin ' on ? ( phone rings ) - Yeah . Scully . - Hey Scully . It 's me . - Mulder , what time is it ? - 2 _ 34am _ - I need you on the next flight to Las Vegas . - Las Vegas ? Why ? It 's the Lone Gunmen . They 're onto something big . - What exactly ? - it 's really important . Trust me . Yeah , I trust you , Mu / den It 's the Three Stooges I 'm not so sure about . Look , I can 't talk over an unsecured line . Please just get here . It 's an emergency . OK . OK , OK , OK . - What if she calls him back ? - If she calls him , it rings here . She 's gonna kick our ass . What do you need Scully for ? We 're up against agents of the government . We need our own agent . And that would be Mulder . Why do you want just Scully ? - She 's gonna kick our ass . - Mulder 's too high profile . He 's a household name to the black ops who kidnapped Susanne . Byers , I 've hacked into the hotel computers . Susanne IVIodeski 's not registered here . Are you sure you saw her ? Are you absolutely , positively sure ? It was her . She 's here . I 've gotta find her . You gotta find some ice . You need a drink . ( elevator doors open ) - Byers is trying to kill himself . - Stop trying to kill yourself . It 's not deep enough . Come see what we got . Room 1066 , registered to our mystery poker player . One Grant Ellis . New Mexico plates on his car . Which come back listed " DOD Motor Pool " _ - Signed out from ... - Whitestone , New IVIexico _ The advanced army weapons facility where Susanne worked . Ellie 's credit cards get billed to the administrative offices . He 's looking like some kind of shadow government Pooh-Bah . He brainwashed her . Well , that 's what they do there ! The E-H gas she developed . Call it psychological warfare , behaviour modification , but it 's all about mind control . And undoubtedly the process has been refined in the last decade . She ran from them , refused to take part in their tests , their crimes against the American people . There 's no way she would choose to be working for them now , working for that guy , kissing him . Clearly he brainwashed her . I know a way to find out . Buenos dies . I can 't get into the conference . The guard who threw me out is on the door . Let me go . CIA ! Freeze ! Thatjust keeps gettin ' funnier . - Where 's your girlfriend Timmy ? - In the desert . This naked chick teaches you how to shoot machine guns . It costs 200 beans , though . I told him he was a putz _ Whats the matter , Byers ? Your bestest dog die ? What 's up ? We 're trying to get into the Saguaro Room . Good luck ! That 's the Holy Grail . Bug sweeps . Casino security outside . Government security inside . There 's no way in . I can get in there . And I will , too , when the time is right . - Doo-doo , ca-ca , poo-poo . - Go brush your hair , Michael Bolton . There 's a hole in their security . I 've got it figured out . But there 's nothing worth hearing until they unveil their new assassination technology . Again with the assassination technology , hm ? I need to get in there , Jimmy . I need to know what 's happening in there today . If you can really get in there , prove it . ( man ) Real-world application will always , always remain necessary in weaponry . And we believe a weapon can 't be fielded , can 't be put into the arsenal until its efficacy in combat can be established . If you 'll take a look at the kill-ratio productivity chart we 've provided for you , and turn to page 22 , you 'll see that we 've experienced ... Ooh . There 's your fascist chickie , Byers . _ .and second quarter periods of the previous year . But before we 're tempted to pat ourselves on the back for this , we have to remember ... Timmy ? These operations originally budgeted for ... - Damn . - ( metal gives ) om om Hey ! Hey ! Hold on ! Hold on ! You 're one of them . You really screwed things up , Jimmy . - We had big plans for you . - What big plans ? Political assassination . I was right . I was right about the whole thing ! Every good plan needs a patsy . No ! - ( Scully ) Can you take this up , please ? - Sure . - Agent Scully . - Where 's Mulder ? I 've been trying to call him . - He 's , uh ... I think his phone 's messed up . - He may be hard to reach for a few hours . He suggested we work with you . Bring you up to speed . By all means . Bring me up to speed . - ( man over radio ) Who 's the injured party ? - James Belmont . Over . - This way . - ( Langly ) Oh , man . Jimmy . ( bus driver ) He just jumped ! No warning , no nothing ! He just dived right out in front of me . - ( Langly ) Oh , God . It Jimmy _ - It 's not my fault . He was just standing there , and then he just dives under the bus . - This wasn 't a suicide . - You know this man ? What 's going on here ? ( door unlocking ) ( knock on door ) Susanne , do you remember me ? John , what are you doing here ? I 'm here to save you . - From what ? - I don 't think you are yourself . I think that you 've been mistreated and confused . And I 'm afraid that your beliefs , your opinions , are no longer your own . As in ... I 've been brainwashed ? I don 't know what to tell you . I haven 't been . Your life may be in danger . A friend of mine has just been killed . Murdered . - What ? - And that man that you 're with ... My fiancé ? - I 'm sorry , John . I think you 'd better go . - No , wait . Wait ! Ten years ago , I saw you thrown into a car . Kidnapped right in front of me . Did that not happen ? Did I just dream all of that ? Lthappened _ But things got better . Whoops . Sorry , buddy . That Susanne 's a popular girl . - You 're sure you wanna be here for this ? - Oh , yeah . I 'm cool . Let 's just find out what killed him . OK . James Belmont , age 29 . Visual exam reveals injuries consistent with massive trauma . Multiple rib fractures with concomitant haemorrhaging , both internal and external . His spine is fractured and partially exposed . Um ... What if ... they did something to him ? - You know , to make him pancake himself ? - Who 's " they " ? You know . Them . I 'll begin with a Y incision . Langly , will you go over there and pass me the striker saw ? It 's right there on the counter . Thank you . - ( vomits ) - Are you OK , Langly ? ( continues vomiting ) ( metallic clanking ) sullyi Scully , wake up . Are you OK ? What happened ? I think you got a little queasy and took a header . Blood and guts can bother some people . Yeah ... I guess . Are you gonna be all right ? Sure , cutie . So ... you 're done with Jimmy ? Done , done , done _ - How do you roll this thing ? - Uh , Scully ? What ... killed him ? My medical opinion ? Beep ... - And that 's all you found ? - That 's all I know . Sullyi - What did you find out ? - Autopsy was negatory . - Jimmy squished himself . - And where is the scrumptious Agent Scully ? She said she had somethin ' important to do . Man , she is seriouslyjet-lagged . - You got product already ? - No . An earlier bird got the worm . ( Susanne ) All this waiting . I feel like they 're keeping tabs on us , watching us . ( man ) Honey you worry too much . The plan is still on schedule . E verything 's falling into place . We 've worked so long and so hard for this . It 's not her . They 're making her do this somehow . Buddy , now , I know something about the fairer sex . Trust me . You can bring a horse to water , but you can 't make her drink . - She would not marry that man ! - You don 't know him like I do . How 'd you get in here ? One of you left this in my room . Grant Ellis saved my life . He saved the lives of thousands . Huh ! I need to talk to you , John . I need to try and explain everything . Come on . Let 's hit the slots . Watch your back . Mata Hari . ( sighs ) You said something about a friend being murdered . Not that I can prove it . But I think he saw something he was not supposed to see at your conference . - You may be in danger . - I am ... always . So is Grant . I have thought about this moment so many times . All the things I would say to you if I ever saw you again . And then there you were , at my door . And I ... They took me 10 years ago . They did things to me . And it was like drowning every day . Underwater , struggling to breathe . And one day , a hand broke the surface , reached down and pulled me up . I wanted it to be you , John . It was Grant . He worked for them at the project . I didn 't trust him . Not for years . Not until I realised that he was working against them in his own way . Stalling them , sabotaging their tests . He reminded me of you . - You 're just lucky I got a conscience . - How 's that ? If I unleashed my true kung fu on this casino , I could break the bank . Yeah . Find yourself buried under six feet of desert dirt . - Hey , guys . - Hey , Timmy . I 'm sorry about Jimmy . Hey , Langly . The guys are all up in my room for a round of Dungeons and Dragons in honour of Jimmy . Lord Ivlanhammer will be in attendance . - I 'm gonna go play a little DD in memoriam _ - That 's touching , man . ( woman laughing raucously ) ( laughing continues ) - Scully ? - Oh , hey . Long time no see . ( whispers ) No , that 's not nice . I like Hike . Cigarette ? You don 't smoke . But who 's got a match ? Well ... I just can 't decide who lights my fire . That 's it . All right , jim-dandies , back off . This is Special Agent Dana Scully of the FBI . If you so much as touch her , you may be committing a federal of fence . Come on . Come on . Could 've been stardust . Maybe next time . I hope you brought your wallet . Just because this is a memorial game ... - What 's this ? - Oh , we have got a game for you . ( Ellis ) Trust me . This is gonna work . - You didn 't tape this ? - No . Which means they surveilled us . They know our plans , they know everything . - What is your plan ? - To escape . This conference was our chance to slip out on the last day , go public with our files , 3ll OUFWSHDODS FSSS3FCl " l . We could finally make it happen this time . We 'd gathered up enough proof . The public is ready to believe , now more than ever . They know everything . They 'll kill us , John , Grant and me both . - ( Scully giggles ) - Come on . - Come on . Settle down , settle down . - OK , OK . I found Agent Scully Golightly holding court at the bar . I 've never seen her drunk before . God , this can 't be . - Please . - Hi . She 's not drunk . Look at this . That was made by an injector gun . What the hell was she injected with ? It 's a derivative of E-H gas . A-H , anoetic histamine , my latest creation . I could have developed it years ago , but I held off . I wasn 't about to let those bastards I work for get their hands on it . Grant thought if we developed a small batch , then destroyed the notes , that we would have the proof we needed to go public . And a weapon to use against them . Who else has access to this anoetic histamine ? Grant and I are the only two people that have ... That have the samples . This will counteract the anoetic effect . Hey , cutie . OW . Just a little prick . - Bad trip ? - She 'll be fine . - She just needs to sleep it off . - I don 't understand . Why would the government want to turn Scully into a bimbo ? That 's just a potential side effect . Anoetic histamine impedes higher-brain functions . - It promotes suggestibility - Mind control , brainwashing . That explains Jimmy . They told him to commit suicide . And Scully . They made her forget her autopsy findings . But what is their larger purpose ? What are they planning ? Well , whatever it is , we better find out fast . ( knock on door ) Right on time . This is your weapon . All you do is pull the trigger . You will enter the Saguaro Room at 10 _ 05am _ This badge will give you access . Take a seat toward the back and wait . At 10.15 , a break will be called . Rise , approach the target and fire three shots . This brings us to the notion of acceptable risk . Of course , risk is defined as exposure during both utilisation and post-project evaluation . In a secure proving ground , i.e. a domestic engagement , we have had great success . Now , offshore utilisations can afford a more comprehensive definition of acceptable risk . Proper target appraisal can provide a risk-free trial environment . Political instability and lack of efficient infrastructure can offer a target area of nearly zero-risk potential . - Authorised attendees only . - I 'm an FBI agent . Authorised attendees . Of course , risk management goes hand in hand with operational preparedness . And that 's our topic for the remainder of this session . AI , this would be a good time to take a break . Oh , yeah . Let 's take five , everybody . Smoke ' em if you got ' em . Oh , my God . ( man ) Somebody help her ! Somebody ! - Susanne . - Federal Agent . - Call for help . - We need an ambulance . A woman 's been shot . She 's bleeding . Hurry ! We 're on our way . - Who did this ? Who did this ? ! - The shooter got away . Detain this man . Get him outta here . Good work , party girl . ( Scully ) I 'll take him from here . Wait a minute . Where are you taking me ? Susanne ? Can we have a moment alone , please ? - I 'll be fine . - We 'll be right down the hall . OK . Thanks for the tip . Big surprise , huh ? - Since you programmed my friend to kill me . - No , Susanne . It wasn 't my idea . You knew about it . You gave it to them . The A-H ? If I hadn 't thought to check Langly , if I hadn 't given him the antidote ... I don 't understand . Why save me ? Why save my life just to take it away ? - You know why . - You were done with me . - You had what you wanted . - They had what they wanted . The project was over . Honest to God , it wasn 't my idea . All those years you spent gaining my trust . You pretended that you loved me . What could they possibly give you for that ? What was it worth to you , Grant ? What was your price ? What did you get ? ! My life . They ' ¢ l Kill me . ( door shuts ) Hello . So sorry , Susanne . The county death records , then the state tax rolls . Then the morgue . List that they misplaced the body . Jawohl , Herr Kommandami Why don 't you just zap me and brainwash me again ? - Do it . Then we can make him cut his hair . - ( knock on door ) - Can you answer that ? - Why me ? She 's your little chickadee . Hurry up . Come on . Come on in , Mata Hari . CIA . Freeze . - Let her go . - Sure . No ! You know the best thing about killing you three ? Now I won 't have to dress like you any more . Oh ! Get him off me ! Hi , cutie . What do you wanna do with him ? Police conHrm an arrest has been made . This man , Timothy Landau , of Alamogordo , New Mexico , has confessed to the murders of Grant Ellis and Susanne Modeski . Hello ? Mulder ? Can you hear me ? I 'm at the hotel . Where are you ? What do you mean , what hotel ? Las Vegas . I 'm in Las Vegas . Aren 't you ? You called me . What do you mean , you didn 't call me ? Oh , man . I am gonna kick their asses . ( Byers ) Susanne Modeski is dead . Every computer at every county , state and federal office knows it . This is who you are now . Come with me . - You 'll be safer without me . - I told you , I 'm going public . No , you 're not . You 've done more than enough . Leave it to us now . It 's what we do . This was meant for Grant . I want you to have it . Someday . So , you wanna hit the slots ? You know , Byers , growing old with us ain 't so bad . Oh , shut up , Langly _ You really want him to kill himself ? ( Langly ) Got any quarters ? Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi

I think I 'll stay here . You 're wasting your life in front of that TV . You need to see the real world . It 's HDTV . It has better resolution than the real world . Everyone 's too polite to say you 're covered with bed sores . - Not covered . - Just get in the car . Here we are ! Monument Beach ! Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa ? They 're both in New York ? In the 2600s , New Yorkers elected a villainous governor . He stole most of the world 's monuments . Truly a great man . Look at him up there .

I 'll be right back . Oh , yeah . No ! Nibbler ! Professor ? I need another bikini . Okay , I think there 's one can left . Oh , my . - There . How do I look ? - Like a cheap French harlot . French ?

The greatest sandcastle ever built . King Arthur would 've lived in it if he were a fiddler crab . We should get a picture before the tide comes in . - Does anyone have a camera ? - Right here . Wait , I want to be in the picture too ! Pretend you 're happy . Oh , my God ! What in Babylon ? No ! HERMES : Faster ! We 'll die , won 't we ? I should think so . Although last time aliens invaded ... ... they forced the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously . Oh , yes . Once again , today 's winning lotto number was four . Alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth . We go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal . Ladies and gentlemen , our course is clear . It 's time to knuckle under . Get down on all fours and lick boot . Give our alien masters whatever they- - People of Earth . I am Lure of the planet Omicron Persei Eight . Is this thing on ? Now then , we want the one you call McNeal . Give us McNeal or we 'll waste your cities with our anti-monument laser . We demand McNeal ! As I was saying , mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal whoever he is . Am I right ? Now , the man leading our proud struggle for freedom fresh from his bloody triumph over the Gandhi Nebula pacifists 25-star general , Zapp Brannigan . Look , it 's that idiotic windbag you slept with . The Earth 's under attack . Can 't we forget about that ? Evidently not . If there 's an alien out there I can ' t kill I haven ' t killed him yet . I can ' t go it alone . I order every available ship to report for duty . If you have no ship , secure a weapon . Fire wildly in the air . You heard the windbag : we 're drafted . Everyone into the ship . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hold on . I won 't fight . I 'm a conscientious objector . - A what ? - You know . A coward . As it 's an emergency all robots ' patriotism circuits will be activated . It 's every robot 's duty to give his life for humanity . Oh , crap . We 're from different cultures .

Oh-ho-ho . The luscious Captain Leela . This is turning into one sexy struggle for the future of the human race . Thanks . I 'm not technically human . Right , right . Nobody destroy Leela , either . The key to victory is discipline . That means a well-made bed . Practice until you make your bed in your sleep . While I sleep in it ? You won 't have time to sleep with all the bed-making you 'll do . The alien mother ship 's here . If we hit that bull 's-eye ... ... the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards . Checkmate . My strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it . On my command , all ships file directly into ... ... alien death cannons , clogging them with wreckage . Wouldn 't it make more sense to send the robots in first- - ? Sir ! I volunteer for a suicide mission . Aw , cut it out ! When I 'm in command , son , every mission 's a suicide mission . Which reminds me . Perhaps before we head into battle ... ... you 'd like to make love , in case one of us doesn 't come back ? We should wait till after , in case neither of us comes back . Here 's hoping . I 'll be a science-fiction hero , like Uhura or Captain Janeway or Xena . This isn ' t TV , it 's real life . Can ' t you tell the difference ? Sure . I just like TV better . [ MIMICS SOUND OF GUNFIRE ] Damage report ! The auxiliary power 's out and they spilled my cocktail . All right , scum wads . This one 's for Bender 's cocktail . We did it ! We won !

The mother ship is destroyed . - What is that ? - It appears to be the mother ship . - Then what did we just blow up ? - The Hubble Telescope . Stop exploding , you cowards ! It 's hopeless .

I mean , thank God you 're alive ! Sorry . Check back in three days . A week at the most . We want McNeal ! Stop stalling ! Now , a rebuttal from President McNeal . The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself . Total annihilation is a small price to pay compared with- - Here he is ! Come and get him . - You are not McNeal ! - Huh ? - You are not the one we want . - Thank you , glorious masters . I- - - Give us McNeal ! - That was McNeal . No , McNeal . The Single Female Lawyer . - She 's promiscuous . Wears miniskirts . - Really ? Miniskirts ? That sounds familiar . McNeal , an unmarried human female ... ... struggling to succeed in a human male 's world . Maybe that 's her excuse for incompetence . Silence ! We will accept no more decoys . This is the McNeal . - Wait , I know her . - You do not , you big fat liar . You don 't know anyone . All you do is watch TV . That 's where I know her from . Jenny McNeal . She was a character on a 20th-century TV show , Single Female Lawyer . If they hope to see a TV show that hasn 't existed for 1 000 years ... ... they 're royally boned . We 'll raise your planet 's temperature by one million degrees a day for five days unless we see McNeal at 9 : 00 p.m. tomorrow . 8 : 00 Central . I 'm beginning to think there 'll be no forced mating at all . They 'll destroy the Earth ... ... if they don 't see a TV show about some bimbo lawyer ? How could they know about a show from 1 000 years ago ? Omicron Persei Eight 's about 1 000 light years away . The electromagnetic waves would have just gotten there . - You see- - - Magic . Got it . Back in 1 999 , Single Female Lawyer 's season finale ... ... was interrupted by technical problems . Some idiot spilled Coke on the transmitter . Beer . I would think . They want to see that episode . Let 's find the tape . No copies are left . Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 ... ... during the second coming of Jesus . I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode . I could make up an ending we 'd act out . I could make the costumes . I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower . And I could be an acting coach ! Let 's put on a show ! Leela , you 'll star as Jenny- - Uh-uh . Forget it . A : I 'm camera shy . B : I get tongue-tied in front of an audience armed with death rays . Plus , you don 't have the thighs for a miniskirt . Give me the script . Places everyone ! Okay ... . All set . Lights ! Camera one ! Camera two ! Camera three ! [ CAMERA THREE BUZZES ] Prepare the water cooler ... ... that we may gather around it later to discuss things . BENDER : Single Female Lawyer Fighting for her client Wearing sexy miniskirts And being self-reliant I 'm pretty good . McNeal , you are charged with jury tampering in last week 's case ... ... due to your hot , naked affair with the foreman . How do you plead ? I move for a mistrial ... ... as I 'm also having a hot , naked affair with the foreman of this jury . I 'll see you during the recess . If she wants to be taken seriously , why not tear the judge 's head off ? It is true what they say . Women are from Persei Seven . Men are from Persei Nine . Your witness , Prosecutor Ramirez . Gracias . Single Female Lawyer , where were you the night of August 23rd ? - Sleeping with you ! - Aha ! Getting back to the matter ... . If it please the court ... . There 's nothing else here . You only wrote two pages of dialogue . It took an hour to write . I thought it 'd take an hour to read . - What do we do now ? - I don 't know . Say anything , if it 's compelling and mesmerizing . A tour de force . Uh ... . What say you , Single Female Lawyer ? I say I 'm giving up the law ! And I 'm giving up being single ! Your Honor , will you marry me ? [ HUMS A CLIFF-HANGER TUNE ] Oh , no ! Go to commercial ! We 'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender 's Discount Stereo . - Married ? Jenny can 't get married ! - Why not ? It 's clever , unexpected . That 's not why people watch TV ! Clever things make people feel stupid . Unexpected things make them feel scared . Attention , McNeal . Your unexpected marriage plan scares us . You stole our hearts as a single female lawyer . So shall you remain , or else ! See ? TV audiences don 't want originality . They want what they 've seen 1 000 times before . - What you talking about , Fry ? - Trust me . While other people lived their lives , I watched TV . Deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world . Plus I 'd have lost Workman 's Comp if I went outside . Read these cue cards . And action . Miss McNeal , I must decline your offer of marriage . For you see , I 'm dying . Cough , then fall over dead . My God , he 's dead . I 'll now make my closing statement . With my fiance deceased ... ... I hereby return to my Single Female Lawyer career ... ... no matter what any man says . We find the defendant vulnerable , yet spunky . Hooray ! And cut ! Single Female Lawyer Having lots of sex- - Huh ? McNeal , we are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen . Overall , I would rate it a C-Plus . Okay , not great . As a result , we will not destroy your planet . Neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality . Way to overact , Zoidberg . Now we must return to our planet to catch a 1000-year-old Leno monologue . - You did it , Fry ! - Yep . It was just knowing the secret of all TV shows . At the end of the episode , everything is right back to normal . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

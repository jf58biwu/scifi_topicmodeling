Near miss incoming 1-5-0 to starbo- - No , here it comes ! It 's in the water ! Not bad ... We 've got a report from the scout plane ! No doubt about it !

Course is clear . Commence dive ! Down trim : 20 . Take us to a depth of 300 and hold at cruising speed . Aye , sir . ETA : 1620 UTC . Cut that out . What is it ? That MSDF boat ... Couldn 't we have saved it ? Tsuji ? Sorry , but could you send some food down to the dock area ? Sure . I don 't mind that . Although him ... Hey ! A lot of the boat 's still heavily damaged so how about giving us a hand ? ! What ? Message from base , sir . Tokyo base was destroyed by the enemy bombardment . They 've decided to cancel the next conference . I see . So , we 're the only ones left now , huh ? The captain really takes too many risks . He nearly got us all sunk ! Would you quit it ? ! It 's really cramped in here ! How 'd a big lummox like you ever get to be a pilot ? ! Jeez ... - Can I smoke ? - No ! Irritated ? Not really . It 's not like we ran because we wanted to run . It 's just that we can 't let anything happen to this boat , no matter what . You think that 's funny ? If you 're so scared of losing it , you should lock it up in a vault . Papa ! Papa ! I 've done it ! I 've destroyed another Blue Fleet base ! I killed them all ! Everyone did a wonderful job , Papa ! And soon we 'll know where their main base is , too ! Verg ... Don 't take too many risks . This time we 'll finish them , Papa ! Those annoying pests ... They won 't get back to the land alive ! Not one of them ! Give the order , Papa ! Come home soon . Take care of yourself . We all pray for your safety . He prays ! He prays ... This is no time for prayer ! I heard from your sisters . You were touched by one of the land men . You were , weren 't you ? ! Weren 't you ? Blue Dome approach , this is Ryu-Oh , Blue Fleet submarine number 6 . Request docking clearance into Blue Dome . This is Blue base Novo-0001 . Your ship 's identity is confirmed . Cleared for base docking . Welcome home , " slow turtle " Blue6 ! Warning ! Warning ! You 're docking at too great adepth ! Danger ! Danger ! Stop that at once ! I will inform subdriver control about this ! Just try it ! I 'll dump you into the Marianas Trench ! Okay , that 's enough . Frida 's serious about that , Novo ! I don 't understand . What 's ... ? You saw the blueprints for it , didn 't you ? Yeah ... A long time ago . A really long time ago ... God , you look so happy you 're gonna burst . Like a little kid . China ... France ... India ... Aren 't you honored ? You 're part of Operation Blue . The plan that 's going to create a future for humanity . A future ... We lost the Stream Base in Antarctica two years ago . What have they been doing there ? Now that we 've lost our satellites we aren 't able to peek in and see what they 're up to . With this knife called Stream Base being held to its throat it 's been all humanity could do just to survive . But it looks as though our enemy has decided to make the final cut and wipe us all out . I believe you 've all seen this . The aurora which now covers the entire Earth . Zorndyke has triggered a sudden pole shift which is eliminating the Earth 's magnetic field . Freed of its influence , the crust will begin to move freely . Additionally , this pole shift is destroying the Van Allen radiation belt ! Without it , mankind is doomed ! If we don 't attack Zorndyke 's Stream Base at once we have no future ! Well , then , I 'll explain the mission . We in the Pacific Fleet will cross the Tonga Trench and approach Antarctica from 170 degrees east longitude . At the same time , the Atlantic Fleet will come around the continent from the east attack from 120 degrees east longitude and take control of Stream Base . Owing to the limited scope of this attack we should be able to take Zorndyke 's Stream Base completely . The only path left to humanity is life or death . Failure is not an option . Let me repeat that : If this mission fails we have no future ! I hope you all do your best in this battle . Dr. Marunami , we have a signal from Blue 1 , the Coback . We heard you , Doctor . An excellent speech , sir . What 's the situation with the Atlantic Fleet ? No problems . We hold the final cards here . All you guys in the Pacific Fleet have to do is back us up . We 'll been ough to get rid of Zorndyke . As confident as ever , I see , Admiral . This is payback for ten billion people ! Hamurabi taught that the only payback for death is death ! Hey ! This is ridiculous . Lem me go . But , Admiral , you 're a Christian , are you not ? Somebody 's hacked the I.S.S. line ! No ! That 's impossible ! Zorndyke ... Zorndyke ! It 's Zorndyke ? ! I converted the day you did it ! So that I could avenge my husband and my three children ! Mankind ... Mankind has grown too large . Ambitions and cravings , vengeance and hatred ... How long must the accursed dance continue ? The performance must finally end . And so you murder people for that ? ! It is not murder ... I am merely ... advancing the hands of the clock just a bit . Before it is all too late ... You think that you can play God ? ! Of course not . I am not nearly so arrogant as that . Zorndyke , you monster ! Destroyer of the world ! - We 'll never forgive you ! - Revenge ! We 'll make you pay for our friends ! All right ! All right ! All right ! Hey , have you seen Kino ? Oh , she 's with that guy Hayami in the dock again , isn 't she ? Lucky stiffs ! Getting a little sweet lovin ' in before we set sail ! How about we do some , too ? By the way ... What 's the story with Hayami , anyway ? I heard he got court - martialed before , right ? I dunno . I know he 's talented , but ... I dunno ... We 've got twelve hours till we ship out ! Hurry up with those checks ! This is all for nothing if we mess up now ! How 's the Lorrenzini look ? Howan 's calibrating it . Get moving ! I 'm not gonna be beaten by some little kid ! Calibration , complete . Okay , lower it ! Slowly ! Slowly ! Yeah , that 's the way . Nice and slow ! Don 't try to hide it . Your last cards are nukes , right ? They 're all we have left to use now ! So , in the end , there 's no difference between either side . Zorndyke 's the enemy of mankind ! So we have to kill him ? ! You just don 't want to get any blood on your own hands ! There 's plenty of blood on them already ... Special head , huh ? Hold it ! Mr. Hayami , it 's been a long time since the two of us were in the submariner officer 's training academy . You 've always made me sick ! Thank you . Not because you always had to show off how goddamned brilliant you were . Because you have no sense of responsibility or concern for anyone ! Just once , can 't you think of others or about what we 're trying to accomplish ? ! Like HE does ? ! " He " ... ? We in the Pacific Fleet are going into Stream Base following his lead . He 's the only man to ever make it back from Zorndyke 's base still alive . He came back ... The beast mutation process is proceeding quickly . It won 't be long now . You can read about it in the report . He became that way because of your selfishness . Katsuma ... KATSUMA ! See you around , Hayami ... What 's wrong , Howan ? Shouldn 't you be with Yamada ? The songs ... I hear the songs . Songs ... ? You mean dolphin songs ? Or whales ? Dolphin songs are happy . Yellow and orange ... But these ... They 're black ... They 're just black ... So many of them ... I can 't count them all ! Hayami ! Hayami , where are you ? ! Warning from Novo system thirteen ! Sonar contact ! Four enemy vessels ! Were you followed , Blue 6 ? We 've found them ! We 've finally found them ! Kill all of the Blues in there ! The flags ! Don 't forget the flags ! Warning ! Change course ! Warning ! Warning ! Those idiot machines ... Destroy them ! Game set ... Gam- - They 've broken through the primary Novo system defense line . Enemy fleet approaching zero line ! Intercept them ! Send out the Blue Fleet ! Can 't you open the gate ? We have to get out of here ! At this rate , the enemy 'll destroy Blue Dome and the entire fleet ! Captain ! Hayami 's taking out a trainer ! Hayami ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! How many minutes do you need ? ! Twenty ... No , fifteen ! If the flooding goes on , we can blow the gate ourselves . Gotcha . I 'll see what I can do . Hey ! Hold it ! Where are you going by yourself ? ! I 'm through ! I 'm sick of doing it for mankind or to avenge the deaths of others ! I 'm going after the Ghost Ship ! If I get him , nothing else matters ! Now let me go ! You 've gotta be kidding ! What , are you trying to be cool ? ! Or to run away ? ! What are you talking about ? ! Come back ! Garbage ! Scum ! Come back , you jerk ... Where is it ? ! Is she in one of those ? ! Direct hit on armored gate ! Dock area severely damaged ! Gentlemen , give the evacuation order . All hands to the survival sphere . - Doctor ! - Do you mean ... ? I 'm going to activate Unit B Push . You people , get to the pod ! I 'll stay here and run things till the very end ! Have the Musucas fall back ! Weak ! They 're so weak , Verg ! Pathetic ... When they can 't send their ships out , the Blue base is just a lump of metal ! Outta my way ! The Shinha 's falling ! Open vents on the forward trim tank ! Emergency flood ! Get our nose down , fast ! So far ... We 've come so far ... ! What about the main gate ? ! Isn 't it open yet ? Don 't be sad about this . This result is natural . When science turned its back on the flow of nature mankind fell from its hand . The Blue Fleet can 't be lost now ! Marunami , you 've fought well . Can 't we both see the future which must come my old friend ? Kill them ! Blue Submarine No. 6 . Episode 3 : " Hearts " .

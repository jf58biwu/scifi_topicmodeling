 - [ Young Sydney ] What are you seeing , Jarod ? - [ Young Jarod ] I 'm not sure . Come on , think . Think , Jarod . What does it mean ? These people ... some are angry ... some are sad . - But all for the same reason . - And that is ? Their trust has been violated , Sydney ... by someone they look up to . And now , they can 't trust him . [ Sirens Wailing ] [ Shouting , Indistinct ] - Captain Harrigan . - Are we clear ? O 'Leary 's still in there . O 'Leary , get the hell out . That place is gone . [ Crying ] O 'Leary , report . - What the hell are you doing in there ? - Mommy , where are you ? Somebody help me . It 's okay . You 're gonna be all right . Damn it , O 'Leary . Get the hell out of there , now . Sir . That 's my baby ! That 's my baby ! That 's my baby . ! That 's my baby . ! Gail . Oh , Gail . Thank you . Just doing my job , ma 'am . [ Man Narrating ] [ Miss Parker ] So Mr. Raines loaned him to us ? [ Sydney ] Yes , Miss Parker . You wanna tell me why ? Bear in mind thatJarod 's modus operandi thus far ... has been to collect newspaper stories . So if we can establish a correlation ... between his selection process and his movements ... we may be able to predict his next move by scanning the local and national press ... for stories which may interest him . And Cousin It is your man for the job ? Please don 't trivialize this , Miss Parker . His name is Angelo . He 's very special . Oh , I can see that . - [ Chuckles ] - You know , I thought that place was a goner . I can 't believe you just walked right through that inferno . Well , I wouldn 't recommend trying it at home . - Actually , it 's safer on the job . - Safer ? 68.6 % of your serious injuries occur at home . You run the numbers , it 's a bigger risk taking a bath than it is fighting a fire . - The truth is , I was just following the exit signs . - [ Chuckles ] Hey , can you show me where I can stow this gear ? Yeah , follow me . You take any locker you want . Just make sure it doesn 't have a name on it . - Any one but this one . - I 'm sorry . I didn 't know ... Lieutenant Gleason ? Sorry , man . I should have warned you . That 's Tamara Copeland 's locker . - The firefighter that was killed . - Mm-hmm . She and Gleason were tight . I guess you coming here kind of , you know , closes the door on all that . - Or opens a wound . - Jarod , there you are . One day on the job with us ... and you 're kicking ass like a 20-year veteran . I want you to take a good look at this guy , Roy . Guts , brains and a touch of the crazies . That 's what the Fighting 16th is all about . Listen , Jarod . The reporters are ready to get up close and personal with you . Uh , sir , I don 't want any publicity . Jarod , you are now a member of the best damn fire-fighting unit in this city . You should be proud of that . Besides , it 's good for the team . Yes , sir . Smile pretty . [ Cocktail ] And how long are we going to have to wait until your savant zeroes in on Jarod 's location ? Angelo is not a savant , Miss Parker . Actually , we don 't have a classification for what he is . But think of him like a sponge , if you will . He has no personality ofhis own ... but he can absorb the personality data that we give him . And he has read every scrap we have on Jarod . - So now he 's another Pretender ? - No . He could never make a moral judgment of his own . Also , he would never run away . Where have I heard that before ? - Parker ? - Michael . Come here . - I can 't believe this . How long has it been ? - Too long . - What are you doing here ? - Short business trip . I 'm a sales rep for a pharmaceutical company now . This is part of my territory . What about you ? I , uh , have a mid-level position with a local firm ... nothing very exciting , I 'm afraid . I cannot get over how terrific you look . Despite the lack of good sex . [ Clears Throat ] Michael Patrick , this is Sydney ... my assistant . - Michael . - Sydney . Anyway , I would ask you to join me for a drink at the bar ... - but I can see that you 're both , uh ... - Oh , Sydney was just leaving . Yes , apparently , Sydney was just about to leave . Oh , great . I 'll be at the bar . See you at the office , Syd . Let 's see . I 'm doing my nails ... washing my hair , smoking a cigarette . [ Jarod ] And you 're talking to yourself . Yeah , so what ? That 's what arson investigators do . Jarod O 'Leary . I 'm with the 16th . Yeah , I heard all about you . You 're the guy who saved the little girl in this building . Harrigan must be doing backflips over you . - John Zimmerman . - Oh , I know who you are . You caught the North Hills arsonist , pretty impressive work . Yeah , well , it didn 't get me any dates . It 's glory boys like you that get all the play . I bet you could tell me some tales , huh ? Well , I do know this one about this little monkey and this man in the yellow hat . [ Chuckles ] Yeah , I can take a hint . Nobody wants to talk to guys like me , unless there 's a fire . Then there 's questions , nothing but questions . If you 're so unhappy , why did you pick this line of work ? I didn 't have any choice , really . Most guys who wanna be this close to a fire ... they either set ' em or fight ' em . I fall in the latter category . [ Groans ] - Are you okay ? - Oh , bum knee . Sports injury ? Is that some kind of a joke ? I didn 't mean anything . - Do you mind if I take a stab at this ? - Feel free . Well , we know that the occupant was a smoker . She was smoking a cigarette , doing her nails . So my guess would be that she fell asleep , dropped the cigarette and ... - [ Imitates Blast ] ignited the fluids . - That 's good . Real good . Also wrong . - Electrical fire . - Really ? What makes you so sure ? Well , see , the outlet was overloaded . The burns are mostly concentrated on the walls . The fingernail polish fluid ignited much later . Oh , another needless catastrophe solved . - Impressive . - Eh . - You know , the saddest thing is ... - Hmm ? this singed mattress . This is the closest I get to sex . Long lunch , Miss Parker . Not boring for once . - Any progress ? - Well , slow but steady . Although I can say with 90 % certainty ... thatJarod is due to land somewhere east of the Mississippi . Angelo has eliminated everything west of that . We are definitely closing in . You don 't get out much , do you , Broots ? Page me if you have a breakthrough . - Where will you be ? - Out . What was that all about ? It appears Miss Parker has taken a sudden interest ... in the pharmaceutical industry . [ Growling ] [ Growling ] [ Roy ] Don 't worry . Ember growls at all strangers . - How long do I gotta keep stirring this mess ? - Just until it coagulates . That 's a good word for it . - He thinks you 're a dog . - He does ? Yeah , you 're a stranger in this place . He 's just trying to establish dominance . - Really ? - What , you never had a dog before ? No . I did drive a chimp through the Amazon once . [ Chuckles ] - Here you go . - [ Whining ] He 'll love you in no time . Dogs are amazingly loyal creatures . You keep their bellies full , they 'll do anything you ask . Quit screwin ' around with that stupid mutt . We 're waiting for lunch . Coming right up , sir . Now we know why you had to transfer from your last assignment . - [ Jarod ] Bon appétit . - What is this slop ? It 's optimized nutritional supplement . Hearts of palm , wheat grass and asparagus stewed with tomato . [ Disapproving Chatter ] - I grew up on this stuff . - Threw up is more like it . - [ Clicking Tongue ] - [ Whining ] People , there 's only one thing that can save this disaster . Insta-Cheez ! Haven 't had a decent meal around here since Copeland died . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Miss Parker ] So he 's on the floor . I 'm on top of him . We 're both spent , covered in sweat . And you 're still doing this ? At least three times a week . Isn 't it hard to maintain that level of intensity ? Not if you 're doing it right . Hmm , you 're not doing it at all , are you ? No , truth is ... I gave up fencing after college . Besides , I never found an opponent as formidable as you . Never will . [ Chuckles ] You still have that look in your eye ... half invitation , half intimidation . So which do you want ? [ Chuckles ] Don 't tempt me , Parker . [ Chuckles ] Too late . Uh , check , please . " Aerosol cheese-like imitation food product . " Official food of the Fighting 16th . According to these ingredients , there 's absolutely no nutritional value . Hey , tastes great , and it makes me sleep like a baby . Well , I doubt I 'm going to be getting much sleep around here . Oh , the beds are pathetic , I know . You 'll get used to it . No , I mean , I 've been going over some of these old records . - Boy , you guys are good . - 92 % knockdown rate . That makes us the most efficient company in the city . - I just hope I can live up to your standards . - Well . You follow Harrigan , you 'll be fine . I watched him lead a response with one pumper . He put out a six-alarm fire before the other five even got there . Sounds like he takes a pretty aggressive approach . Except for these warehouse fires . The company arrived before the structures were completely engulfed . Yet each time , Harrigan pulled the team back . - Yeah , they were N.W.S. ' s . - N.W.S. ? Not worth saving . Harrigan decided they were too volatile to risk his men . Live to fight another day . Right . Look , Jarod , you 're gonna fit in fine here . It 's like I said ... you trust Harrigan 's lead , he 'll take care of us . [ Michael ] Nice place you got here , Parker . [ Miss Parker ] How do you know ? You haven 't even seen the bedroom yet . And at this rate , I never will . - How about a drink ? - Don 't tell me you 're tired . I 'm just getting warm . I 'll definitely be wanting that drink . I can 't believe you let all this energy go to waste on a sales job . Don 't forget ... if it weren 't for that job , I wouldn 't be here . When do you leave ? I thought you weren 't done with me . I 'll be here for ... two days . Then let 's not waste any time . Here we are , gentlemen . Eat in good health . - Yeah . - Thanks . Hey , handsome . Nancy , what are you doing here ? I was in the neighborhood . Thought I 'd drop off your work shirts . - You don 't have to do this . - I know . I want to . Business looks good . Oh , since breakfast this morning , on top of which , Manny calls in sick . Manny is sick ? Well , who 's cooking ? Hey , Herb . What should I do with these balls of meat ? I think you two know each other . I 'll take care of the meatballs ... - if you 'll finish cleaning up , okay , Jarod ? - Sure . - Careful , it 's hot . - Okay , thanks . Great guy . - You have no right to be here . - I came by to pay my respects ... and the cook called in sick , so I offered to help . - You would have done the same thing . - What do you want ? A truce would be nice . Look , Lieutenant , I know we haven 't gotten off to a very good start . I just want you to know that I understand how you must be feeling . - Really ? - Tamara Copeland was your best friend . I 'm not trying to take her place . I just wanna do my job . Grab those plates , would you ? - You 're not gonna make this easy , are you ? - What ? Me hating you . - Thanks , Nancy . - See you later . I worry about that girl . - What do you mean ? - It seems like she can 't let go of what happened . It feels like she blames herself for Tamara 's death . It was an accident , wasn 't it ? My daughter was a great firefighter . And I loved her more than anything in this life . But she knew this was dangerous work ... and people die . I gotta go check on the meatballs . Broots , another possibility from Angelo . Sydney , Broots . I 'm confident it 's a landlocked state , either Pennsylvania or West Virginia . This isn 't an exact science . It 's an experimental technique with a huge human element involved . - Been up all night , haven 't you ? - Uh-huh . Let me get you some coffee . Maybe that might help . - Oh , man . Who brought that damn mutt ? - Guilty , sir . Well , keep him out of the house , will you ? Hey , Hank . Off with the shoes . House rules . That Italian slate cost me $ 20 a square foot to put in . You heard about a king in his castle ? Between that mutt and these slobs , I 'm gonna have to build a moat . Cap 's a regular Bob Vila . He built the bar . I 'm gonna build a garage this summer . A remodel this beautiful has to be expensive . - Well , there 's a lot of sweat equity . - [ Roy ] Yeah . - Our sweat , his equity . - Check the hamburgers , Roy . And don 't let ' em burn . Good kid . Can 't handle a belt sander to save his life , but he 's a good kid . You know , this railing ... 1934 ladder truck . The very first one the Fighting 16th ever had . Harrigan 's used that railing a lot , and I don 't mean in the line of duty . - [ Chuckling ] - You know ... you landed yourself in a very special unit , Jarod . Historical is more like it . This is the first unit in the city with two female firefighters . Yeah , with Gleason and Copeland there , it felt like a real family . - Nancy misses Copeland very much . - We all do , son . Must 've taken a lot of guts for Copeland to run into that burning warehouse . Yeah , electrical fire like that . That place must 've been hotter than Satan 's armpit . Copeland was good , but she had an overzealous sense of the heroic . I told everybody to hang back . She thought she heard screams and went inside half-cocked . Really ? That wasn 't in the papers . Copeland did outstanding work on this team . I wasn 't about to let her be disgraced over one mistake . I called the hose crew in to bring in a line and went in after her . By the time I got inside , she was sucked into the smoke and flames . - I never found her . - That was very brave . Truth is , bravery had nothing to do with it . As long as I 'm in charge , this team will never leave one of its own hanging . You 're not going to accept this as a passing good mood , are you ? - I know you too well . - Don 't be so sure . But I 'm concerned . Mr. Patrick seems awfully transient . What I do for recreation is my business . Besides , I like him . Ask yourself this then . Are there enough healthy relationships in your life ... to compensate for what you 're doing for recreation ? These entanglements ? They 're not free from emotional repercussions , you know . Let me give you a nickel 's worth of free advice , Syd . You only know as much about me as I want you to know . And your concern , though touching ... - [ Cups Clink ] - is wasted on me . I 'll tell you what , Jarod . - This is the best meal we 've had around here in months . - Oh , thanks . So how did you become Martha Stewart overnight ? - Insta-Cheez . - [ Chuckles ] Actually , it was an old recipe ofTamara Copeland 's . - Excuse me . - Nancy , I ... Oh , man . I was trying to do something good . I think you did . I think cooking one of Copeland 's meals helps to keep her here among us . - We don 't wanna ever forget her . - No , we sure don 't . - [ Young Sydney ] What are you seeing , Jarod ? - I 'm not sure . Think , Jarod . What does it mean ? Focus on the faces . These people , some are angry , some are sad . - But all for the same reason . - And that is ? They were betrayed by Amin . He killed his own people . Yes , and ? They could no longer trust their own leader . [ Young Sydney ] What are you seeing , Jarod ? What does it mean ? Think , Jarod . What does it mean ? - [ Aerosol Spraying ] - [ Whining ] [ Jarod ] Nothing like a Grinder at Herb 's . - Now that will get you talking to yourself . - They are good . So , you buying me a turkey sandwich . If you 're hoping to get lucky , you 're not . Lucky ? - It 's a joke . - Oh . Well , I was hoping I might ask you a few questions . - Figures . - You see ... I 'm trying to get a grasp on this burn pattern thing . And I have a bet with Roy that this was an accidental electrical fire . - Yeah , well , you better pay him . - Really ? Why is that ? See the char trail lead from the middle of the room , travels out in a web pattern ? All the flames are below the electrical fixtures . It 's a planned torching . Arson . You gonna eat that pickle ? So if it was ruled an electrical fire ... Whoever did it was a moron . Hmm . Well , I guess that moron would have to be you . Because it was your ruling from the Tri-River warehouse fire . You remember the one . She died in it trying to save your life . You don 't know what you 're saying . I know you checked into St. Joe 's Hospital the night she died ... with a third-degree burn on your back . And I also know that Harrigan let three other warehouse fires burn to the ground ... fires that you ruled accidental . Insurance payoffs . Is that why she 's dead ? [ Herb ] Gentlemen . - How do you like those sandwiches ? - They were terrific . - How much do we owe you ? - Hey , your money 's no good here . You guys are family . [ Zimmerman ] An empty warehouse goes up ... a mini-mall gets built . [ Jarod ] Insurance pays for it all . Nobody gets hurt . That 's the way it worked until that night . [ Sighs ] All I had to do was ... spread an alcohol-based propellant around the floor ... and bust a couple of pipes , make it look electrical . Once the fire was burning steady , I started to beat it out of here ... but my knee gave out , and I couldn 't hardly move . Is that how you got burned ? Yeah . Flames were everywhere . They caught my shirt . The damn pain was so bad , I must 've let out a shriek . - Tamara Copeland heard you . - Yeah . I tried to crawl over to an exhaust vent I 'd rigged up to get past the fire crews . But the smoke was searing my lungs , and I collapsed ... and I thought I was a goner for sure . Then I looked up and saw her emerging through the fire . - She must 've recognized you . - Yeah . She knew I 'd done this , but it didn 't stop her . She just went about her job . Instead of saving her own life ... she started to save mine . And then Harrigan came in . He hit her with a crowbar . Told me to get away . Said he wasn 't going down for the fire . He took her oxygen and handed it over like it was nothing . All she wanted to do was save your life . Instead she died in that fiery hell . Jarod . [ Miss Parker Chuckles ] - Parker . - What ? Are we ever gonna make it to your bedroom ? [ Both Laughing ] Getting there is half the fun . - [ Phone Rings ] - Don 't . I have to . - What ? - We have a confirmed hit , Miss Parker . - Angelo ? - Oh , the guy 's amazing . He narrowed it down to five clippings . The winner 's a place called the Borodin Smoke House in Pittsburgh . They confirmed thatJarod was there until recently ... and his trail is probably still hot . Borodin Smoke House , Pittsburgh . Get Sydney on the horn and get transportation ready . I 'll be right over . Yes , ma 'am . Pretty family . Time to go see them . Your business tripjust ended . - [ Knocking On Door ] - Yeah ? - Lieutenant . - Yeah . - Can I show you something ? - Sure , come on in . This is a duty roster . From the night that Tamara Copeland died . If that 's some sick joke , it 's not funny . And if it 's a reminder , I do not need one . You were supposed to work the shift the night she died . But she filled in for you , didn 't she ? It should have been me . I know that you feel that way . But maybe you could allow yourself to see the other side of the coin . They 're more duty rosters . From shifts you filled in for her over the years . Nancy . We all know the risks . You can 't blame yourself . I wasn 't there for her . Maybe you feel you weren 't there for her that night . But you can be there for her now . ThatJarod Vronsky was a godsend . I didn 't think we were going to survive after my father died . Did Jarod leave anything behind ? Oh , he increased productivity ... restructured our investment strategy and organized a dental plan . All he asked in return was to sit in there . Now why would Stepford Boy want to sit in a smokehouse ? Jarod thinks in metaphors . He could be anything from smoke jumper to sideshow fire-eater . Oh , he loved smoke . - Said he wanted it in his pores . - Mr. Borodin . Did Jarod leave anything behind , like a red notebook ? Same as before . I don 't have it . - " Same as before " ? - I have hams to stow . [ Speaking Russian ] I gave it to the other man . - Who ? - A man came here less than an hour ago . He knew many things aboutJarod . He said that the others would come . The others that would want to hurtJarod . Broots is the only other one who knows . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - What ? - [ Broots ] Uh , Miss Parker . I got him . I know exactly whereJarod is . Okay , Ember . It 's showtime . Come on . You can do it . - It 's easy . - [ Whines ] Come on , you can do it . It 's easy . Watch . Like this . Come on , you can do it . Come on . - [ Whines ] - Come on . Ember , come on . Come on . Come on , boy . [ Whines ] [ Barks ] [ Chatter , Indistinct ] Anybody seen Zimmerman ? He 's been paging me all afternoon . Yeah , he just pulled out of here . He looked kind of strange , excited . - He say where he was going ? - No . Oh , he left you this . - Anything wrong , Cap ? - No . [ Harrigan ] Zimmerman ? You here , Zimmerman ? Why , you little bastard . Harrigan . Is this any way to treat a dog ? - What the hell are you doing ? - I wanna show you this neat trick I taught Ember . - I don 't care about that stupid mutt . Uncuff me . - Hey . He 's not stupid . He 's man 's best friend , you know . And I 've learned that if you just keep him well fed ... he 'll do just about anything for you . His food of choice , as is yours , is Insta-Cheez . It 's not very good for you , but , what the hey , it does taste good . O 'Leary , if I get out of here , I 'm gonna break your neck . Then I better not let you out . Now , about that trick . [ Aerosol Spraying ] Ember , light this place up . Come on , boy . Come on . Good boy . Neat little trick , huh , Harrigan ? But watch , there 's more . - What the hell are you doing ? - Oops , electrical fire . Started by a dog . Terrible accident . - Put it out ! - I 'd like to , but I don 't know how . You see , I 'm not really a fireman . Oops , there goes another one . - Take the damn cuffs off me now ! - Can 't . Gotta make a phone call . [ Touchtones Beeping ] - [ Phone Ringing ] - Company 16 . [ Jarod ] I 'd like to report a fire , please . 16309 Ellsworth Terrace . Thank you . - [ Ringing ] - [ Beeping ] Well , I sure hope that the Fighting 16th gets here on time . The flames are spreading pretty fast in these walls . But that 's not really a surprise . You see , I 've treated the wiring throughout the house with this accelerant . That way the flames and the fire spread completely . And it looks like an accident . No one will ever know . - What about me ? - Well , even the best arsonists make mistakes ... - [ Flames Building ] - don 't they , Chief ? Oh , no ! - Give me the key ! - He looks pretty scared ... doesn 't he , Ember ? I bet Tamara Copeland looked pretty scared too the night of the Tri-River fire . But she had you there to back her up . Someone she trusted to protect her . Go wait outside , Ember . - I 'd hate to see you get burned . - [ Sirens Approaching ] - Lieutenant ! - Hold it , guys . There 's something you need to know first . [ Jarod ] I 've got to go now . It 's getting pretty stuffy in here . O 'Leary , you can 't leave me here to burn ! Why not ? You left Tamara Copeland , didn 't you ? - Yes , I left her ! - You left her to burn . So you could collect the payoff money . So you could buy this Italian slate tile . Or that 1934 ladder truck railing around your wet bar that you 're so proud of . Yes , I left her . Now , give me the key , please . - This key ? - Yeah . Sure . Hope you don 't burn . O 'Leary . ! O 'Leary . ! [ Screaming ] My house ! That son of a bitch burned my house ! Put it out . Put it out ! Hang back . This place is definitely N.W.S. Come on , guys . I built that house . Don 't let it burn like that . I 'm your captain . I 'm your damn captain ! To hell with you . [ Glass Shattering ] - You must beJarod . - [ Gun Cocks ] - Who are you ? - [ Chuckles ] Uh , you 're really not in a position to ask . Now put your hands up and turn around . [ Barking ] Good-bye . Good-bye . Thank you very much . I have to go . It was very nice to meet you . [ Miss Parker ] You cover the back . Everyone else with me . Who 're you working for ? I told you , Parker . I 'm a sales rep for a ... Oh , you bitch ! You don 't know the half of it . Who 're you working for ? All right . All right . The Centre . Mr. Raines . Don 't , Parker . Don 't . There might be repercussions . [ Groaning ] By the way , I was faking it . Hey , I can 't eat this . - I wouldn 't give that crap to my dog . - Oh , no problem . I can fix that . Bon appétit .

 Do it ! - Hey . How you doing ? - Quite a little party . - What do you know ? - Reports of at least a dozen shots . Door looks jimmied , but the alarm wasn 't tripped . - Did you see anybody come out ? - No . Whoever it is , they 're still in there . Move . Move . Lieutenant . Over here . It looks like someone got hit . So where 'd he go ? Stay low . Keep looking . Davis . Gonzalez . Yeah . - Easy , buddy . Take it easy . Are you hurt ? - They 're here . - Who 's here ? - They 're here . They 're here . They 're here . Talk to us . Who 's here ? Come on . They 're here . They 're here . - Stop ! Police ! - Don 't shoot . - Turn around slowly . - We didn 't do it . - Do what ? - Whatever . Face down on the floor . Now ! - Get down . Get down . Get down . - Cuff ' em . - Spread ' em . - Oh , man . They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! We 're screwed . Thank you for getting me involved in this , Doohickey . - Frohike , you hippie jerk . - Doohickey . You know , with that long blond hair , you 'll be the first one in here that gets traded for cigarettes . I 'm gonna be laughing my ass off . Oh , yeah ? You wanna cha-cha ? - Any time , any place . - Both of you , relax . - Shut up , you narc . - It 's your fault we 're here . You in the suit . You first . - Detective Munch , Baltimore Homicide . - Did they find her ? And a good evening to you . Sorry . No sign of your mystery lady . She is real . The fbi agent saw her . Yeah , well , Special Agent ... Mulder is currently being held in five-point restraints and jabbering like a monkey , and the fbi 's not talking either . So , what I 'm looking at is a warehouse break-in with nothing stolen , a shoot-out but no guns , lots of blood but no bodies , and an fbi agent who likes to take off all his clothes and talk about space aliens . Fill me in from the top . Start with your name and birth date . John Fitzgerald Byers . 11 / 22 / 63 . - Seriously . - I was named after JFK . Before the assassination my parents were gonna call me Bertram . Lucky you . Occupation ? I work for the government , for the moment . And what do you do for the government ? I 'm a public-affairs officer for the Federal Communications Commission . It was in that capacity that I was attending the computer and electronics show in Baltimore . It was where this whole thing started , just this morning . We at the FCC enjoy forging positive ties with the American public . It 's our way of saying " Communication is just another word for sharing . " - Hi , guys . Would you like a button ? - Up yours , narc . Of course , some people don 't see it like that . At any rate , that was where I first saw her . Would you like a button ? I 'm still not sure why I did what I did next . It was so unlike me . There was just something about her . Ken , I 'm gonna take a short break , OK ? Whatever . Hello , pretty lady . Picture this . Crystal-clear television , 33 channels ' worth , with no monthly cable bill . - Excuse me ? - I know what you 're thinking : " Melvin , are you out of your mind ? No cable bill ? " But that 's exactly what I 'm saying . I 'm talking premium channels , too . You got your HBO , you got your Cinemax , you got your Showtime , all courtesy of this marvel designed and built by the Frohike Electronics Corporation . There 's a name that inspires consumer confidence . Shut up , punk . Where were we ? Hey , lady . If you wanna watch Matlock all blue and squiggly , buy from this guy . If you want quality bootleg cable , talk to me . If you want a converter that 'll short out and burn your house down , talk to this guy . That was a one-time fluke . I heatsink every breadboard . Yeah ? And what about coax loss ? Do you use the RG6 / U or the 52-ohm RG8 ? - Trick question . It 's the 9913 . - Big man . A narc . God , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . She 's very cute . Yes , she is . Thank you . Wait . You just look like you could use some help . So , my daughter turned three years old last week . Last Tuesday was her birthday . I hope he remembered that . Her father took her from you ? My former boyfriend . He kidnapped her . It 's a long story . Basically , I got involved with a man who turned out to be a complete psychotic . Yeah ? We were only together a few months . I was attracted to him because he was dark and mysterious . And then he just kept getting darker and more mysterious . I got pregnant and he left . And then he suddenly came back and took her about six months ago . That 's terrible . Did you call the police ? Of course . The police , and then private investigators . - They were surprisingly unhelpful . - That 's unbelievable . Yeah . Well . At least I managed to get a couple of leads . I was told he 's in the Baltimore area , so here I am . - Well , that 's a start . - Yeah . Except he now knows that I 'm looking for him , and the closer I get , the more dangerous he becomes . Are you worried he might harm your daughter ? Let 's just say I wanna find her , not him . This is the only other lead I 've got . That 's why I 'm here today . This has something to do with computers , doesn 't it ? The Internet ? Actually , the ARPANET . It 's a government network created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . You can access it through the lnternet , though . Somehow this means something to my ex-boyfriend . I was hoping it might be a means of finding my daughter . If you want , I can go online . Try and find out for you . Would you ? That ... I would really , really appreciate that . By the way , my name 's John . Holly . It 's nice to meet you . Holly . Just like the sugar . Yeah . - Just like the sugar . - That 's funny . Ken , could you maybe go take a short break ? Whatever . OK . Let 's see . So , your ex-boyfriend is into computers ? I don 't really know . I knew very little about him . Except that he 's psychotic . Somehow this kicked us into the Defense Data Network . I 'm sorry . I think this is the end of the line . Isn 't this something you could - how do you say it - hack into ? Hack into ? No . Technically , yes , I probably could , but this belongs to the Department of Defense . This is a secured site . I work for the FCC . This is the kind of thing we 're trying to stop . Thank you , John . I appreciate your time . Wait . You didn 't see this . - What did you do ? - It 's a government system . I know a couple of loginout tricks with VMS Version 5 . Never mind . - Look up Susanne Modeski , my daughter . - I 'll try . But there 's just no way of telling ... - What is that ? - It 's an encrypted file . Why would she have an encrypted file in a secret Defense Department database ? - Can you decode it ? - I 'd need some help . Can you print it out for me ? - Oh , my God . Hide . - What ? - My ex-boyfriend is out there . - The psychotic ? He must have tracked me here . He 's looking for me . Dammit . There he is . You look like a man who 'd appreciate 33 channels of crystal-clear TV . - No thanks , handsome . - A man of distinction . Punk ass . It was at this point we enlisted the help of one Melvin Frohike , computer hacker . Hello , pretty lady . Oh , yeah . What 's with the narc ? We told him the entire story . I hoped he could assist me in deciphering the encrypted file . It was at this point , however , that Mr Frohike raised an interesting question . I don 't understand . Why don 't you just kick his ass ? - What ? - No . I just want these pages decoded . Can you do that ? Sure , baby . My kung fu is the best . But it could take hours . I say cut to the chase . If pretty boy can tell us where your daughter is , we just need to beat it out of him . Bad idea . He 's very dangerous . Lady , I 'm dangerous . All right , so we 'll just follow him . - For all we know , he 's got the girl here . - Holly , it makes sense . No . Just stay away from him . We 'll stay back a ways . Just wait for us here . - Come on , FCC . - But ... - What 's he doing ? - Talking to somebody . This dude doesn 't look so tough . Act casual . They 're here . Alien invaders are among us . Detect their presence with high-tech modern products . Sorry . He 's moving . What 's up , fellas ? - You looking for somebody ? - Just the bathroom . I don 't think it 's down here . Hey , are you with the FCC ? - What 's it to you ? - I think we share the same credit union . Special Agent Fox Mulder . I 'm with the Federal Bureau of lnvestigation . I was hoping you could help me . I 'm looking for a girl . I was wondering if you 'd seen her . This is her here . Have you seen her ? Sorry . - What did she do ? - What 's it to you ? Thanks , guys , all right ? Yeah , Mulder . Hey , Reggie . What 's up ? - What the hell was that all about ? - Her ex-boyfriend is with the fbi ? - Where 'd she go ? - OK , stand back , folks . - Excuse us here . - Come on . - Ken ? - You don 't understand . All I did was play Dig Dug . I didn 't hack into anybody 's computer . - Excuse us , please . - Seriously . I 've got a circulatory problem . - I have a tendency to fall down a lot . - Wait . It was me . - What are you doing ? - I hacked into their computer . You wanna turn yourself in ? Are you crazy ? A hacker never turns himself in . - I am not a hacker . - Listen . We got fbi agents running around , military police ... Whatever the hell is going on around here , it 's big , and your lady friend is at the center of it all . She needs my help . How can we learn what 's going on ? The fbi are looking for her . Hack into the fbi mainframe . I know just the guy who can do it . You are talking about a premeditated crime against the United States Government . Your second one today . Welcome to the dark side . OK , ladies . Who 's down for 50 ? 50 bucks . Anyone ? 50 bucks . Oh , man . My diaper-wearing granny would bet 50 . Come on . There 's no game here . All right . 50 . Elron the Druid bets 50 . Cash only , Elron . I don 't take no personal checks from the Bank of Middle Earth . Come on , natural 20 . Daddy needs a new Sword of Wounding . What 's the big idea bringing the narc in here ? Me and the narc have a proposition for you . What proposition ? The coolest hack in the world . Lord Manhammer ? Say it . Say it . Your kung fu is the best . Here . Make yourself useful . What does this do ? - Besides overheat and burn the hotel down ? - It 's a loop line shunt . Anyone who tries to trace us will get bounced around by CP 's call-forwarding software . - My personal invention . - Oh , God . I 'm gonna get fired . I 'm gonna go to jail . - I deserve to go to jail . - Shut up already . - What do you need me to do ? - Just watch and learn . Bingo . Government hack is a snap . Last week I got into the Maryland DMV . Changed my endorsement so I could handicap park . I got tinnitus . - What now ? - Look up the fbi agent . - What did he say his name was ? - Mulder . - Is that your boy ? - Fox William Mulder . Born 10 / 13 / 61 . Degree in psychology from Oxford University , top of his class at Quantico . Commendations out the yin-yang . Currently attached to the Violent Crimes Unit . Single . There 's nothing in here about him being a psycho or having a daughter . Try , under " active cases , " Holly Modeski . - Nada . No case file . - Try the daughter , Susanne Modeski . She 's Susanne Modeski ? " Employee at the Army Advanced Weapons Facility at Whitestone , New Mexico . " Whitecorps . Oh , man . Look at this . It says here she blew up one of their labs , killed four people , including the MP who tried to stop her at the gate . " Subject Modeski is considered unstable and delusional . " " lntellectually brilliant yet prone to confabulation and violent behavior . " " Psychotic and profoundly paranoid . " " Armed and extremely dangerous . Do not approach . " " Call immediately for backup . " You 've been reading about me . My name is Susanne Modeski , not Holly . I 'm ... I was an organic chemist for the Advanced Weapons Facility . But I never blew up any lab and I certainly never killed anybody . All I did was try to quit . I don 't have a job you just quit . What about your daughter ? I don 't have one . I 'm sorry . - The photo ? - It came with the wallet . You wouldn 't have believed the truth , obviously , and I desperately needed your help . For what , exactly ? To get this . I still need it deciphered . This has in it everything I need to expose the United States Government 's plot against its own people . One I unwittingly helped to forward by developing the ergotamine-histamine gas . - Ergotamine-hista ... - E-H for short . It 's an aerosolized gas , which in small doses causes anxiety and paranoia in its subject . Paranoia . Gotcha . Secret forces within the government plan to test this gas on the American people , right here in Baltimore . I am not making this up . Don 't you get it ? Nobody is safe . - Look what they did to JFK . - What did they do to JFK ? Dallas ? 1963 ? Hello ? They want to control every aspect of our lives from the cradle to the grave . They practically do already . Hotel Bible . Who do you think put this here ? - The government ? - One in every hotel room in America . It 's the perfect vessel for electronic surveillance . No one ever questions its presence . Now , I 'm sorry . You 're telling me that the US Government , - the government that gave us Amtrak ... - And the Susan B Anthony dollar . .. is behind some of the darkest , most far-reaching conspiracies on the planet ? - That 's just crazy . - I mean , this guy works for the government . I 'll prove it to you . Just help me decipher this . What do you say , guys ? Of course , at that point , we didn 't feel like we had much choice . - Get it off me . Langly , what 's taking so long ? - It should be up any second . Oh , yeah . Here we go . Far out . Thank God for supercomputers . " The surprise defection of Dr Modeski is a blow to the program , though not a fatal one . The timetable remains unchanged . " " The first EBO will occur in the Baltimore-Washington corridor within one week 's time . " - What 's an EBO ? - Engineered Biological Operation . Toxic organic agents used on humans . " Security risks are being attenuated . " " Dr Modeski 's team has been processed , and plausible denial constructed . " Another way of saying they 've murdered my research associates and placed the blame on me . Now do you understand ? Wait . Here it is . " E-H product is presently warehoused at 204 Fells Point Road , Iot number A-9000 , awaiting EBO . " This is it . " Subject Modeski monitored around the clock . " " Covert electronics installed per Dr Michael Kilbourne , 11 / 6 / 88 . " Who 's Dr Kilbourne ? My dentist . Excuse me . - What do you think ? - That thing about her dentist ... Dr Modeski ? Get in here . Oh , my God . What did you do ? Look at it . Look at it ! Am I seeing what I think I 'm seeing ? What 's the address of that warehouse ? - Where 's the tooth ? - We flushed it . We were afraid it would give away our location . So , we broke into the warehouse . Here it is . A-9000 , right ? - Asthma medicine . - This is how they plan to distribute the gas . In asthma inhalers . This is their random test . Now we 've got proof . Stay where you are . I 'm a federal agent . Susanne Modeski , you are under arrest for the murders of four people at Whitestone army base . - She didn 't do it . - She 's innocent . You three are under arrest also . Ma 'am , stay where you are . There 's more going on here than meets the eye . You three get on the ground now . Ma 'am , stop moving . I 'm not gonna ask you again . - Dr Modeski , please come with us . - Federal agent . Identify yourself . - Ma 'am , come with us . - Step forward and identify yourselves now . Oh , man . Susanne ? Sanitize it . They 're here . I 'm alive . I 'm alive . I 'm alive ! Who are you people ? - What authority do you have to do this ? - Shut up , Byers . Bag him ? - No one touches this man . - Excuse me . - Byers . - Sir ! Why are you doing this ? You people framed Susanne Modeski . You plan to test that chemical on an unwitting public . Why ? - For what possible reason ? - Byers , shut up . Who gives you the authority ? No bags . Whoa , guys . Behave yourselves . That 's it ? You 're just trying to intimidate us , to scare us , so we 'll keep quiet ? Byers , I swear to God , I 'll shoot you myself . It 's all true , what Susanne said about you people , isn 't it ? About John F Kennedy ? Dallas ? I heard it was a lone gunman . And that was the last we saw of him . Almost immediately , the police got there . We panicked and hid . You know the rest . Do I look like Geraldo to you ? Don 't lie to me like I 'm Geraldo . I 'm not Geraldo . Oh , man . It 's not all a bad dream . - I am in hell . - Women . Ain 't it the truth ? - What do you mean , " women " ? - You know what he means . Your molar-pulling girlfriend roped us in then left us . Is that what you meant ? Look , she is hot . But you gotta admit , we 're here because of her . I 'm here because I wanted to learn the truth . I assumed that was the same for you . Susanne opened my eyes to it . She doesn 't owe me anything . If there was some way I could help her still , I 'd do it in a second . Agent Mulder came to and verified your warehouse story , at least , what little he seems to recall of it . Three cheers for the fbi . You guys are free to go . Come on . Let 's go . Here 's a tip . Aluminum foil makes a lovely hat and blocks out the government 's mind-control rays . Keep you guys out of trouble . One green nylon wallet containing $ 38 in cash . One ... whatever in the hell this is . Detective ? A stolen car turned up at the train station . It 's the one the fbi agent was driving . OK . Susanne must have taken Mulder 's car . She left it at the station . - So ? - So maybe we can catch up with her . - Where ? She took a train . - No , she 's too smart for that . Don 't you see ? She just meant to throw them off . She said she wanted to go public . The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station . Susanne ! John . They didn 't believe my story . Not a word of it . Who in their right mind would ? - What are you gonna do now ? - Try other newspapers , TV stations . Not give up . Keep trying to find people who will listen . People like you . I appreciate what you did for me . All three of you . We still want to help . You already have . Guys ... No matter how paranoid you are , you 're not paranoid enough . Tell the truth . Reach as many people as you can with it . That 's your weapon . Susanne ! You feeling better ? Yeah , I am . Thank you . I just ... I have these weird ideas in my head that I can 't seem to shake . What kind of ideas ? - Weird ones . - You gonna bust us ? I 'm not sure yet . I just spoke with my ASAC and he tells me that Dr Susanne Modeski is no longer wanted by the fbi . She 's still missing , but the case is suddenly closed . What I need from you guys is to tell me what the hell happened last night . You want the truth ? Yeah , I want the truth . You might wanna sit down . This is gonna take a while . The truth is , none of us is safe . Secret elements within the government seek to surveil us and control our lives . What ? - Tell him about the hotel Bibles . - I 'm coming to that . It all started with Susanne Modeski . Visiontext Subtitles : Abigail Smith US english

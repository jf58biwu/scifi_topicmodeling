 Keep to the centre channel ! We must stick together ! If you damage that package , you won 't get paid ! Ah ! Save the package ! No ! Duke of Northampton . Accident during a motoring holiday . Fatal , sadly . 2,000 words by five o 'clock , Mr. Malone . Oh ... ! Mr. McArdle ? The decapitation in Hackney . I know the area well . - Could I cover it ? - Arkwright 's on it . What about the Whitechapel opium dens ? I thought maybe I could go under cover . - Maybe write about the white slave trade . - You read too much trash . I 've been on obituaries for over a year . Give me a chance ! - What do you know about dinosaurs ? - Not much . I 'm attending a lecture tonight at the Natural History Museum . - You can come and write it up . - Gladys told me of this . She 's my girl . Her father arranged the evening . He 's high up in the Royal Society . If I like it , I might put you on the next murder . - Thank you very much . - I still need 2,000 words on the Duke ! Sorry I 'm late . The Duke had a full life . - Edward , you do talk in riddles . - Good evening , Professor Illingworth . We 'd better go in . I detest missing the beginning of a lecture . You might learn something . Summerlee 's a good man . Not an original mind , of course , but solid , very solid . Edward . You mustn 't ! You shouldn 't be so pretty . Have you thought any more about our conversation ? - Which one ? There are so many . - You know which one . - Gladys , I DO have prospects . - Look , it 's Lord Roxton ! He 's just come back from Africa . Hunting elephants and tigers . - Actually , tigers come from India . - Pedantry is not a virtue , Edward . - Will you be returning to Africa soon ? - I have no particular plans at present . - Are you engaged to Lady Scarborough ? - You mustn 't believe the newspapers . Lord Roxton ! Was it terribly dangerous in the jungle ? The odd rogue elephant . Nothing as alarming as a society hostess with marriageable daughters . - Come on , laddie ! - Sorry , Mr. McArdle . Millions of years before the first Angle , Celt or Saxon set trepidatious foot on this sceptr 'd isle , those astonishing creatures , to which we give the name dinosaurs , cast their ... - Sir , you need a ticket ! - I have important scientific evidence . Take your hands off me ! Thank you , gentlemen . You MAY let him go . Despite appearances , he isn 't a burglar or pickpocket . I see you 're still having trouble with your timekeeping , Professor Challenger . What have you got there , Challenger ? The Professor and I were at Oxford together . He was often late for lectures then , as well . I was punctual if I thought there was something worth hearing . Do you mind ? - Mrs. Summerlee . - George . George Challenger . A slapdash scientist with an absurdly high opinion of himself . Summerlee beat him to the Chair of Zoology . He 's never got over it . When Professor Challenger is finally ready , perhaps I might continue ? Carry on , Professor . The very word dinosaur , meaning " terrible reptile " , tells us this is a vertebra from a creature known as " Iguanodon bernissartensis " . Behind me is an artist 's impression of the iguanodon , which stood on its hind legs in the manner of a kangaroo . Oh , come on ! A kangaroo ? Are you sure ? Have you ever seen one ? Don 't be absurd ! No one 's ever seen a dinosaur . The great size of these creatures was paradoxically their weakness , for the dinosaurs could not compete with the smaller and more agile mammals . Where 's his proof ? The proof is that we are here and dinosaurs are remarkably thin on the ground . Professor Summerlee I wonder if you would be kind enough to identify something for me . I will take questions at the end . I 'm sure you will . Let 's have a look at this first . Now what do you make of that ? It appears to be a remarkably well-preserved fossil of the forearm of a pterosaur , a flying reptile of the Mesozoic period . But it isn 't a fossil , is it ? There 's something up here . Make sure you get all this down . Must be a fake . Clever , undoubtedly , but a fake . This bone came from an animal that died just two months ago . Rubbish ! - This is genuine , Challenger ? - Yes . I say that with authority . - What authority ? - Because I shot it myself . The pterosaur , far from being extinct , is alive and well and living in the Amazon rainforest . This man is an attention-seeking charlatan ! Hear , hear ! I came here tonight to propose an expedition to discover the lair of the pterosaur . - This stunt is beneath even you , George . - It 's no stunt , Leo . I should like to express my thanks to Professor Challenger . I 've not been so well amused since I read Professor Challenger 's paper on the possibility of conveying mankind to the moon ! In a rocket ! Professor Challenger . Professor Challenger ! What exactly is your proposal ? The nest of the pterosaurs is deep in a dense and unchartered region of Brazil . Sounds perilous . I should very much like to join you . Moreover , I am willing to cover half the total costs incurred . You can 't ! - Can we look to science for the balance ? - You can look where you like , but you won 't get a penny from any academic institution with which I am involved . My name is Edward Malone . I 'm a reporter for The Gazette and I should like to volunteer . No newspapermen , thank you . Anyone else ? Lord Brass , proprietor of The Gazette , will match Lord Roxton 's offer . What ? ! - In that case , you 're in ! - Have you gone mad ? This might be the story of the century , owned exclusively by The Gazette ! - Not if he 's a raving lunatic . - Then keep me on obituaries forever . Never mind that , laddie . You 'll be writing your own . Well , Leo . What do you say ? Why don 't you join me ? Nothing on Earth would cause me to risk my scholarly reputation by taking part in your ludicrous hare-brained wild-goose chase of an expedition ! Professor Challenger . May we have a word ? The London Times . Of course . What would you like to know ? - May I have your name , sir ? - Professor L Summerlee . You really don 't have to do this . You have nothing to prove . It 's my responsibility to ensure there 's SOME proper science on this trip . Lord Brass expects a handsome return on his investment . Make sure he gets it . I 'll do my best , Mr. McArdle . I should have sent Arkwright . Well , you 'll have to do . Don 't come back without a front page , Malone . I want a full accounting of your expenses , down to the last penny ! - Lord Roxton . A few words , sir ? - No questions . Thank you . Bye-bye . Oh , hello . How sweet of you to come . I do not expect to find dinosaurs , but I do understand science is indigestible to people unless dressed up in a colourful package . Professor Challenger ! Do you really expect to see dinosaurs ? Ah , there 's Mrs. Summerlee . I won 't be a moment . Look after yourself , dear . Kiss your father , children . - Good luck , sir . - Thank you . See you when we get back . All ashore now ! I hope you know what you 're doing , George . - I 'm awfully proud of you . - Are you really ? Of course . After all , I expect there 'll be poisonous snakes and hostile natives , and all sorts of terrible dangers , won 't there ? - Yes , I suppose . - Good . Or what would be the point in going ? One word , Gladys , and I 'd stay here with you . - Edward , you would hate yourself ! - Not necessarily . Give me your answer . Edward , you are awfully sweet , but ever since I was a little girl , I 've always promised myself that the man I married would be the heroic type . Good luck , Roxton . That 's quite enough , young man ! Gladys ... Huh ! - Good luck , Challenger . - Illingworth . That young man is very forward . It 's just as well he 's going abroad . Pretty girl . Yes , my fianc ée , Gladys . 8-calibre . Pistol grip to stock . Nitro-express cartridge , firing a charge of 12 drams . - It 'll knock down a charging bull elephant . - There are no elephants in Brazil . I know . But it doesn 't hurt to be prepared . Tell me , Mr Malone . Have you ever been close enough to a really dangerous wild animal to stare into its eyes ? I assume not . Shall I tell you what you see there ? Your own death . An uncomfortable experience . On the contrary , it 's profoundly stimulating . You might want to get that down . Gentlemen . If you please . - Time to reveal our destination . - Why did you have to be so secretive ? - He didn 't trust us to keep our mouths shut . - Yes . Mr Malone has kindly agreed to keep an accurate record of our progress . Now ... this is roughly where I shot the pterosaur . It 's right on the edge of the unexplored regions . When I got back , I found this account of a Portuguese expedition that went to the same region in 1649 . Only one man returned , Father Luis Mendoz . When they found him in the jungle , it was assumed he was mad . So we 're going to be following a map drawn up by a lunatic ! - He was raving about dragons . - Dinosaurs . Exactly . Now , according to Luis Mendoz , there 's a remote plateau in the middle of the unmapped territory . He says there 's a cave system leading right the way up to the summit . - His claim makes perfect sense . - Why ? For a pterosaur or any other prehistoric creature to have survived , it must have been isolated from the mainstream of evolutionary development . Where do you propose we start our search for this mythical plateau ? - It wasn 't mythical to Padre Mendoz ! - How very reassuring . Your mind is as fossilised as the exhibits in your precious museums ! - How dare you ! - Gentlemen ! Please . There 's a small mission about a week 's journey upriver . It 's run by a Reverend Theo Kerr . A Theo Kerr wrote a very silly book condemning Darwin . - It 's the same man . - Oh , splendid . " Dear Mr McArdle , herewith my first dispatch , together with expenses . " " Notwithstanding our agreement that you would rewrite my accounts , I have tried to embrace a style which will appeal to Gazette readers . " " After an uneventful journey of some seven weeks , we find ourselves in the upper reaches of the mighty Amazon river , the greatest river in South America , if not the world . " " The mission station , which is our present destination , will provide the last chance to savour the comforts of the civilised world . " " And beyond that lies the hardships and the terrors of the unknown . " - If she 's a missionary , I 'll be a heathen . - Sh ! Professor Challenger ? Agnes Cluny . My uncle and I have been expecting you . He went downriver for supplies . He should be back today . These are my colleagues . Lord Roxton . - How do you do ? - Hello . - Mr Malone . - Hello . And Professor Summerlee . This way . - This is Samuel , the lead bearer . - Pleased to meat you . He wants to know which direction you 're headed . Ten days due north . - Something wrong ? - The Indians say there are bad spirits there . Ah , well . He may find this more powerful than " curipuri " . Yes ? Ah , no . That to go . This to come back . What did you tell him ? That their wives will not thank them if they refuse the work . I 'll take that . Little Miss Muffet , she sat on a tuffet eating her curds and whey . Along came a ... What ARE you on about ? Stay still ! The tarantula can give a nasty bite if provoked . - Ugly brute , isn 't it ? - I think they 're fascinating . - Roxton , take charge here , will you ? - Just coming , Professor . I was born here . My parents were botanists . They died in an accident on the river when I was five . My uncle ... I call Theo my uncle . He was a good friend of my parents . He brought me up . They built this church . In your letter you didn 't say exactly why you were coming here . - Of course , it 's none of my business . - No , no . It would be unfair to enjoy your hospitality and not tell you the truth . - But you might find it hard to believe . - You wouldn 't be alone in that regard . Pastor Theo ! Pastor Theo ! Professor Challenger , I presume ? Do you like opera , Miss Cluny ? It must be wonderful to see one . Regarding Mendoz , I 've heard stories about him . He was ... oh , yes quite mad . - This " curipuri " , what is that ? - Superstition . Curipuri are the bad spirits that haunt a man 's dreams . Sometimes they take the shape of great birds or lizards . You hear that , Leo ? You 'll not find any dinosaurs around here , gentlemen . You 're quite right to be sceptical , Reverend . The Dinosauria became extinct over sixty million years ago . Sixty million years . My goodness , a long time . No . The Earth is only 6,000 years old . The calculation can easily be made from the biblical evidence . Do these calculations take fossils into account ? Of course . Fossils are the remains of creatures that were deposited after the great flood . The ones that didn 't make it into the ark , I suppose ! I have to see to the lamps . Goodnight , everyone . I think I 'll turn in , too . Goodnight . I am aware , Professor , that you disagree with my views . But your theory of evolution makes no sense to me . - More than creating the world in seven days . - Six . God rested on the seventh . Thank you for not laughing at my uncle . I don 't share his beliefs but I respect his faith . I have some difficulty with Mr Darwin 's monkeys myself . So many beautiful things are hidden away in remote places . I suppose that must be the attraction for a scientist , to discover one of those beautiful things . But the Bible is not a textbook ! - No , it 's the word of God . - It is no basis for serious science . - You would replace God with man ? - And you 'd replace science with twaddle ? - Goodnight , gentlemen . Goodnight , Reverend . Lord Roxton ? I wonder if I might have a word ? Should you be flirting with her ? - Was I flirting ? And what if I was ? - She 's young . - Not much younger than you . 'She 's been brought up in the jungle . ' - She has no idea of men and women . - The birds and the bees . I 'm sure she 's familiar with them , not to mention every other biting insect . But it IS obvious that socially she 's a little ... - Well , backward . - Edward , grateful as I am for this chat , and for your advice , but perhaps in future you 'd like to mind your own damn business ! Goodnight . Goodnight . - Agnes has just asked if she can join us . - No , no , no . She 'd be very useful . She 's an expert in local medicines and speaks the Indian dialect . Taking a woman on an expedition is a bad idea . Men can rub along and rough it together . Women have different needs . She 's lived here all her life . She 'll be less of a liability than Mr Malone . I agree with Lord Roxton . - So do I. We 're entering into the unknown . It 's no place for women . My niece tells me she has offered to go with you on your expedition . - Yes , we 've just been discussing it . - I cannot allow it . Agnes has been with me since her parents died . She 's everything to me . Oh , Agnes . I was just talking to Professor Challenger , and he 's agreed ... Why don 't we ask Miss Agnes what SHE wants to do ? George ... We can 't watch these people go off into the jungle and not offer them our help . Is it charity or your own ambition that makes you want to go ? Does the Psalm not say , " The Lord careth for the strangers " ? Don 't worry , Reverend . We 'll get her back safely . " Six days upriver , we enter territory where native tribes are beyond the reach even of Christian missionaries . " " We have been joined in our endeavours by Miss Agnes Cluny , the Reverend Theo Kerr 's niece . " " Her reasons for taking part in our expedition are not altogether clear . " " Our readers may be interested to know she has adapted to the rigours of jungle life by wearing trousers at all times , even at dinner ! " " Professor Challenger is in his element . " " Nothing will divert his single-minded determination to achieve our goal , not even ' amahuaca cannibals ' , as he casually named them . " " Fortunately , they don 't seem TOO interested in us ... yet . " - You suck the insect into the bag . - I know how to use it , thank you . Really ? I thought you might have forgotten . It 's been a long time since you 've done any REAL science ! Is there coffee in that pot ? - Yes . - Jolly good . Coffee ? Thank you . " A hundred miles upstream from the mission , we find the secret tributary along which Professor Challenger returned on his previous journey . " " His ' private gate into the unknown ' , as he called it . " " The drums that had worried us earlier have started again , much closer now . " " Their menace is reflected on the faces of our Indian bearers . " " We ARE being watched . " I was wondering whether you might have a remedy for these biting insects . Mmm . You get these leaves ... Yeah . ... and crush them , and mix them with urine . What , my own ? Yes ... Yes . Rub it into your skin . You 'll find it quite effective . Thank you . " Our canoes hidden , we continue on foot , our trusty bearers taking the greater burden of the expedition 's equipment . " " As we get further from civilisation , I am grateful to Miss Cluny for sharing with me the quaint and often surprising folk remedies of the jungle . " Pwoar ! - What are they talking about ? - Curipuri . They don 't like it here . Um ... Professor Challenger ? I think you 'd better look at this . Stay in the camp . Stay in the camp ! What is this ? Some kind of tribal fetish , or what ? I don 't know . Where are you going ? Don 't be ridiculous . Come back ! Don 't expect to be paid ! Pah ! Look at all this stuff . This is ludicrous ! How far can we go without bearers ? As far as we have to . Quiet . Someone 's coming . Uncle ? You people have been making good time . I 've been tracking you for days . Ah . How are you doing ? I hope you don 't mind . I wanted to join you , but perhaps it 's too late . - We 've had some trouble . - Yes , I passed the Indians . I tried to reason with them , but they 're a very superstitious people . What can you do ? Nothing . - Go back , I guess . - Oh , no . We go on , without bearers . - Which way are you headed ? - Due north . May I suggest you turn north-east ? I think you 'll find the going easier . According to Mendoz 's map , the plateau lies due north , there . I myself have penetrated some little ways into this jungle . It 's not easy going . In a couple of days you CAN turn back north . North-east . Very well . " You may be surprised how superstition can influence the uncivilised mind ; how a crude effigy of sticks and bones can send natives screaming hysterically into the night . " " It is fortuitous that the Reverend Kerr should turn up just when we had been abandoned by our timid bearers . " " The way north must be arduous indeed if this is easy by comparison . " - I can take something if you like . - It 's been a while since I had a rucksack . " After three days , we reach a river and our progress improves dramatically . " Miss Cluny , do you think there are piranha in these waters ? Piranha aren 't dangerous . That 's a myth . - It 's the snakes you have to watch . - That 's right . One bite from a coral snake and you 're dead in seconds . Not necessarily . A young man in good health might live for up to a minute ! I shouldn 't worry , Mr Malone . Coral snakes are far more frightened of us . Keep VERY still . Oh , my God ! Out of the water ! Not you , Edward . Don 't move ! Keep calm , Edward ! It 's the bag . There 's something in the bag . Drop the bag , Edward . Ah ! - Get rid of the bag ! - What ? Urgh ! Ah ! It 's all right . It 's all right . - What the hell was in it ? - Some insect specimens . New species , as far as I could see . I 'm most disappointed to have lost them . You should be more careful . It was probably those insects that attracted the snakes . I hardly think so . Puzzling . He 's a ... very determined man , isn 't he ? I can think of other words that describe him . - Are you all right ? - Yes . Thank you . - Can I see ? - Please do . Everything in this place wants to eat me . - These are REALLY good . - Thank you . It must be strange for you , living at the mission . - It 's all I 've ever known . - No , I mean being so far from civilisation . Perhaps we are not as uncivilised as you think , Mr Malone . At the mission I can have any books I want . My uncle has his gramophone . Perhaps we 're not as " socially backward " as you imagine . " We never did discover what it was that so attracted the coral snakes , let alone how it came to be in Professor Summerlee 's bag . " # Take me back to London , # # quickly as you can . # # Oh , Mr Porter , # # what a silly girl I am . # - Must you sing ? - Yes . It keeps the spirits up . It has the opposite effect on me . Lord Roxton ? May I borrow your pistol ? - There 's something that needs shooting . - With pleasure . Professor ! The plateau ! Right where Mendoz 's map said it would be ! - Congratulations . - Thank you . " Our efforts have been rewarded . The memory all of our difficulties fades away as we gaze at the grandeur of this magnificent sight . " " We had placed our trust in Padre Mendoz and his map , and once again he has proved sound . " " There IS a cave system , exactly as he claimed . " " Thank the Lord , for without it the towering cliff face would be insurmountable . " Watch your heads , everybody . Leo . Look at this ! - Look , it 's an iguanodon ! - Nonsense . Iguanodon went on two legs . Oh , yes , that 's right . Just like a kangaroo . God ! The limitations of the encyclopaedic mind ! Through here . Nothing here . Damn ! - What is it ? - I 'm afraid the cave 's blocked . This was the only route to take us up . Look at this . Powder marks . I think it 's been blasted . Blasted ? Why would somebody do that ? - What now , Professor ? - We have no choice . We have to continue around the base of the plateau until we DO find a way up . Ooh . What a little beauty ! Come and see what I 've got ! Coming , Professor ? Whatever it is , I 've probably seen it a hundred times already . - An atlas moth . - Attacus atlas . - Beautiful , isn 't it ? - Beautiful . It 's your expedition , Professor , but if it was me ... I would want to get my people home before any serious harm came to them . Everyone is here of their own free will . Pterosaur . It 's a pterosaur ! Challenger ! Look , an atlas moth . What is it ? Where 's the pig ? What have you done with our dinner ? A real-life pterosaur just swooped off with our dinner , and you bring me a moth ! - What ? - Really ? Where ? Beautiful ! Reverend ? It MUST have been a vulture . Since when do vultures snatch roasting pigs from spits ? It was a pterosaur , damn it ! The Amazon vulture is a VERY big bird , and in the dark ... Will you deny the evidence of your own eyes ? It was reptilian . It didn 't have a bloody feather on it ! This is absurd ! We 've walked nearly halfway round this plateau . Our supplies are getting dangerously low . And just look at these cliffs ! There 's no way up . I will NOT be dragged around any further on this wild-goose chase ! Professor Summerlee is right . Our supplies are very low . We should go back while we can . " Just as the rigours of the expedition were taking their toll , Professor Challenger spotted what seemed to be a route to the summit . " " Though weak from hunger and exhaustion , we applied ourselves to the ascent . " Well done , professors . Not much further . Come on , Edward . Don 't take it too high ! We are going to need all the length . Yes ! Ha-ha-ha-ha ! Perfect ! Ha ! Ladies and gentlemen , I now declare this bridge open ! All right , all ready . Start crossing . After you , George . I 'm ... I 'm forgetting my manners . Ladies first . Ready . Agnes , don 't go . It 's all right , Uncle . - Don 't ! - It 's quite safe . Come across . I promise it 's safe . You 're doing very well . Steady . Well done ! All right ? Almost there . We 've come this far . Just don 't look down . - Oh , thank you . Thank you . - Well done , Professor . Get his pack off . Ready , Professor ? See , it 's easy . Easy as falling off a log . Oh-oh-oh ! No ! Ah ! Hold on ! Don 't look down ! I 'm OK . - Sorry about that . - Not to worry . - All right ? One step at a time . - OK . Well , come on , Reverend . It 's perfectly safe . Reverend ? What 's happening ? What are you doing , man ? Stop that ! Reverend , no . For God 's sake ! Agnes , no ! This place belongs to the Devil . It is not part of God 's kingdom . - Reverend ! - Uncle ! Stop that , please ! You entered the Devil 's country . - Reverend ! - He 's mad ! Urgh ! - Roxton ! - Have you got it ? Are you all right ? Just hold on ! Yes , indeed . Give me your hand . Give me your hand . " We had achieved our goal , but at what cost ? " " There is now little hope of return . " " Nothing , however , can dampen the professors ' enthusiasm for this new land . " These plants , Challenger - it 's not possible ! Have you ever seen this type of redwood and tree fern together ? Of course not . They shouldn 't even be growing in the same hemisphere . - My uncle 's a good man and he loves me . - He has an odd way of showing it . He was behind that curipuri nonsense and it 's clear he doesn 't want us to come back . And he doesn 't expect us to . - Are you all right , Miss Cluny ? - Fine , thank you . I 'll go and see if I can find some water , shall I ? - Take a gun . - Right . - May I ? - Be my guest . What do you think of that ? Is that an orchid ? I don 't know . - Keep warm . - Thank you . Figaro . Try this one . Come on . Good boy ! Where are you going ? Where are you going ? Figaro ! Professor ! Dear God , it can 't be ! An iguanodon . Without a shadow of a doubt . No , no . We 're perfectly safe . It 's a herbivore . Agnes , come here . Leo , do you see the way it moves ? On four legs . - But we know it moved on two . - We ? You were guessing and you know it ! Have you ever seen anything so remarkable before ? Beautiful . It 's quite beautiful . All my life , I never thought ... I never dreamed . I know , Leo . I know . - What will you tell your readers , Mr Malone ? - I haven 't the faintest idea . - Look at this little brute . - Oh , my God . You shot Figaro ! - Figaro ? - It 'll keep us going for a couple of days . - We eat him ? - I wasn 't going to have him stuffed . - I can 't say it looks appetising . - I 've had worse at school . - Let 's have a look . - Any sign of differentiation ? Should roast nicely . Figaro ! Good Lord . There 's another one ! Hay ! Obviously he enjoys your writing , Mr Malone . " There are men of whom it can be said they can charm birds from the treas . " " But not so many , I think , that can charm a dinosaur . " " With our base camp established , Professor Challenger is determined to explore this extraordinary landscape . " Sh ! What the hell are those ? We 've found it . Leo , the lair of the pterosaurs ! My case rests , I think . They are huge . Their wingspans , about 15 feet . When we get back to London , Leo , remind me to invite the Board of the Royal Society to eat their hats ! What do you make of that ? They 're feeding their young . Altricial behaviour from reptiles . That 's astonishing ! - Have a look . - It IS astonishing . Leo , get down ! No human being has seen such things . It 's like opening a window on the beginning of time . Leo , come on . Run ! Professor , come on ! Run , everybody . Run ! Malone , don 't just stand there . Help him , man ! Come on ! Edward , fire your bloody pistol ! Urgh ! Urgh ! Fire it ! Not at us . Give it to me . Take the rifle . Get him to the woods . Everyone armed from now on . We have to get out of here . - Easily said , Professor . - You must rest , Professor . - Anything else I can do ? - Not for the moment . You 've been in a few scrapes , Roxton . Have you ever been in a situation worse than this ? Well , let me see . No . No , I can safely say this is the least promising setup I have ever encountered . We have no way down off the plateau , and thanks to your insistence on secrecy , the only person who knows where we are seems happy to let us die here . Well , there 's no need to be so cheerful about it . Life is a game , Professor . My philosophy is to play it to the full . In any case , does our fate matter so much ? I feel sorry for Summerlee . He has a family . Edward has his Gladys . Agnes the world always misses a pretty girl . But you and me , Professor who 'll miss us ? Would you like some ? No , no , no , no ! This is my responsibility . I got these people up here and I intend to get them down again . Well said , Professor . After all , we 're not finished yet . Ah ! Get a gun ! - How is he ? - I 'm all right . I 'm sure you are , Professor . You 're in good hands . - What was that thing that attacked us ? - It was an allosaur . Bony ridges and crests above the eyes , unmistakable . One of the most vicious predators imaginable . It 's a creature from hell . Anything to report ? Dinosaurs ! - Lots of them . - Any like last night ? No . Er ... they 're more like the harmless one - the ig ... the ig ... - The iguanodon . - Yes ! And there 's a lake that 's not too far . - How big ? - Ah . Er ... Windermere ? Good . Fresh water . There must be another way down from this plateau . - There must be . - We 'll get you home , Leo . In the meantime , think of the wonderful opportunities for research . This is your fault . It 's your vanity and pigheadedness that has stranded us here . - I was only seeking the truth ! - What use is the truth when we 're all dead ? I 'm coming down ! AHH ! Ugh ! Are you all right ? - All right ? - Yes . - Sure ? - Yes . - What were those things ? - Some kind of ape or orang-utan . - No , they looked almost human . - Human ? Come on , we 'd better keep moving . Hmm . Fresh water . At least we won 't die of thirst . You saw the lake first , Mr Malone . It 's only fair you should name it . Gladys . Lake Gladys . Lake Gladys ? I think that 's very romantic . Yes , it is , very . Lake Gladys ? Oh , she 'll be very proud . Don 't worry , they 'll find us . This is as good a place as any . - Right , dinner . - Warm-blooded if possible . Did you know Lord Roxton well - in London ? Only through the gossip columns . He has quite a reputation . Oh . - What kind of reputation ? - Women . Oh . Look , you shouldn 't take him seriously . I mean , if he flirts with you . He flirts with every woman he meets . It doesn 't mean anything . He 's not serious when it comes to women , and the KIND of women that he usually ... I know what you mean . Why would he look at a girl who lives in the jungle ? - You 're wrong , because he does . - Be quiet ! - Shut up ! - How dare you ? Oh ! Run ! Hurry ! - I 'm all right . - Come on ! Go ! Go ! Edward , get up ! Run ! Wah ! Go ! Go ! - Go ! - It 's too fast . Come on . Come on ! I think we lost him . No , we haven 't ! Hurry ! Ah ! Move , Agnes ! Stay there ! Now ! Through here . Well , that was distinctly uncomfortable . " Gazette man narrowly escapes death after struggle with dinosaur . " " Chucked in the stinking pit of death , they faced the creature that time forgot . " - You should write for the press . - I read a lot of bad novels . - It 's my ambition to write them . - I 'm sure you 'd be very good at it . - You were very brave . - We 'd have been lost without the trap . Yes . But who on Earth dug it ? Probably dinner . We should get the guns . Edward . Blood . No ! I thought they 'd got you , too . - Who ? - Those things from the forest . - You 're bleeding ! - I 'm fine . They caught us by surprise . - They 've taken the professors . - What ? - Why would they take them ? - I don 't know . Use this at close range , you 're bound to hit something . All right ? You 'd better hurry up if we 're going to pick up this trail . Look ! Canoes , on the lake ! Get down . They 're coming this way . We should go . Hold on . Indians , up here on the plateau . They could help us . What if they 're hostile ? The professors might not last that long . Get off . Stop that ! Stop it ! Challenger ! I see a cross . They might be Christian . Yes , or they 've robbed and murdered a passing missionary . They 've seen our bags . They 're speaking an Indian dialect but there 's words of Portuguese . Urgh ! - I 'm going to try and talk with them . - Agnes ! Death to the Ape Men ! Friends . We are friends . Don 't shoot ! Who are you ? We are from the lands below . We need help . Have you seen a woman like this ? Look at her clothes ! Whoever killed the apeman is their friend . Tell him I killed him , that I can kill many more with this . They resemble pithecanthropus , don 't you think ? The brow ridges and the line of the jaw . The cranium is much larger than one would expect . Undoubtedly . They 're quite unique . Yes , I shall name them " Pithecanthropus challengeris " . Unless you have any objections , Leo . Just be quiet . For once in your life , just shut up ! Quite beautiful ! There 's humans on the plateau . Stop that . Stop it ! My God ! You know , George , I 've always envied you . It 's scientists like you who are remembered . Bloody-minded mavericks , not plodders like me . Without plodders , Leo , we 'd all be wasting our time . Hmm . I envy you , as well . You have Hilda , your family . I 've spent my whole life coming home to an empty house . It 's hard to bear the thought of never seeing the children again . But for me , you 'd be at home with them . NO ! Leo . NO ! This way . No . No ! No ! No ! Leo ! God help me ! NO ! Oh , my God ! No ! - Stop shooting , John . Please ! - Hold your fire now . Somebody do something ! That 's enough ! They 're dangerous animals . They need finishing off . John , this is a new species . They MUST be preserved . Please ! It must stop . Stop it now ! Stop now ! Stop ! " Brutal and cruel as these strange half-human animals were , perhaps our own behaviour to them was barely less savage . " " Yet how could any of us criticize Lord Roxton when the professors have been saved from such a terrible death ? " " We are consoled by the thought that some of these creatures have been spared . " I hope I didn 't strike a sentimental note back there in the camp . Not at all , Leo . You know , there 's no one else I 'd rather be on a cannibal 's menu with . " On the far side of the lake above the tree-line lies the Indian village . " " Here the Indians can more easily protect themselves from attack by carnivorous dinosaurs . " " It appears we have rescued none other than the son of the chief , and with this piece of good fortune , for the first time in days , our spirits begin to lift . " Achille . I feared you were dead . Father , Padre Mendoz has returned to us . Clearly , these people recognise natural authority when they see it ! He really is intolerable . Padre Mendoz . He and his daughter thank you for bringing back his son . They keep calling you Padre Mendoz . - Why ? - I don 't know . We have triumphed over our enemies ! We need not fear the Ape Men any more ! We shall kill them now and clear the forest forever of their stink . They must die ! " The Conversion of the Savages to the Ways of Christ " , by our old friend , Father Luis Mendoz . Handsome chap , hmm ? Father Mendoz is " the father who watches over them " . The stories tell of how he left them but they always knew he 'd come back . - Their ancestors found white men . - The survivors of the Portuguese expedition . They were nearly dead . Their people brought them here , and they married women from the tribe . Ask him how they got up here . - The way down is no longer open to them . - What does he mean , " no longer open " ? When he was a child , a man came and lived with them . - They didn 't realise he was the Devil . - The Devil ? May I ? Um ... The Devil left and blocked the cave to punish them . This is the other end of the cave we found at the bottom . If the Devil did block this cave , he was familiar with explosives . You see , Leo , nature doesn 't always extinguish one species while another evolves . This plateau has a unique balance that somehow allows the apemen and the Indians AND the dinosaurs to co-exist . - Now , that is fascinating , isn 't it ? - Undoubtedly . And I look forward to returning with a properly-equipped expedition to study it . For now , I 'm more concerned with how we 're going to get down from here . Marea . Mary . Your name is Mary ... Marea . John . John . Agnes , please tell Marea the food is wonderful . It 's a long time since I 've tasted such splendid cooking . She says to thank you for the compliment , but she doesn 't cook the food . She kills it . The women in this tribe hunt and fight with the men until they are married . The village is a natural fortress . So why stray to the apemen 's side of the lake ? For food ? Look . They have security here but very little else . - They have to hunt down in the forest . - That must be dangerous . Their life is dangerous . Ah ! Thank you . Very much . You love all this attention , don 't you ? You 're only jealous because you 're not a god ! I meant what I said , George . I want to go home . What 's happening , Agnes ? He says tomorrow the apemen will be killed in front of the whole tribe . They carry an evil spirit . This one is to be slaughtered in Lord Roxton 's honour . Tell them it 's very hospitable , but not to trouble themselves on my account . No one will be killed . No one ! Make that absolutely clear , Agnes . He says they must die . Letting them live would bring disaster . - I forbid it ! - I 'm not sure we should interfere . These creatures are unique , a clear missing link between animal and human , evolution made flesh . We must get the chance to study them . - But then what ? - We return them to their own environment . The killing MUST stop . Is that clear ? Padre Mendoz has spoken . - You 've humiliated the son of the chief . - Isn 't it better than watch him kill it ? You can 't just change a whole way of life . Perhaps not , but I CAN save these unfortunates . For now , possibly . You may think me heartless , Agnes , but I see no point in being sentimental . If we weren 't here , these ... er , things , whatever they are , would be dead by now . But we ARE here . I don 't think they would thank you for your compassion . All these animals you hunt ... Do you never feel pity for them ? No . No more than they would for me . But animals have no morality , only instinct . You are a human being . You have a choice . Forgive me , but perhaps you don 't understand the cruelty of nature . Perhaps not . But I am beginning to understand you , Lord Roxton . - I think you 've hurt his feelings . - I doubt it . He 's behaving in the only way he knows . You have to admit he has got us through quite a lot . I 'm not ungrateful , it 's just perhaps he isn 't quite the man I thought he was . " And so began our time in the village . " " From its safety , we looked down on a prehistoric world where beauty and cruelty so often seemed to exist side by side . " Puff ? " Professor Challenger relishes his divine status amongst the Indians and looks forward to taking his place in the history books , ignoring the small matter of how we shall actually return to civilisation . " " Professor Summerlee , by contrast , thinks of little else , and devises ever more ingenious methods of escape . " " He seems grateful for my help in his efforts . " " Lord Roxton is most at home here , and the Indians recognise him as one of their own , a hunter amongst warriors . " " Only the presence of the apemen disturbs the tranquillity of the village , but as long as they enjoy Professor Challenger 's protection , they are safe . " Yah ! Roxton is a great hunter . Very simple . " As the days turn to weeks , we make the best of our enforced stay in this extraordinary land . " " Truly there is no end to the marvels of this place . " Have you chosen this man ? If you approve . He is a fine hunter and worthy of my daughter . The heart . Thank you . Thank you . I give you my heart too . I wish I knew what you were saying . What is that dreadful stench ? Pterosaur guano ! I 've been knee-deep in it all day . Look , Edward , they 're burying the poor thing . Leo . Come here . I believe they 're digging a grave . Do you see it ? - Fascinating . - And look at the flowers . This is another example of ritual in these creatures . - George , what on Earth are you doing ? - Observing . - Hello . - Hello . I 'd be flattered if someone named a lake after me . I sometimes wonder if I 'll ever see Gladys again . Tell me about her . She has the bluest , bluest eyes , the sweetest little mouth , and everything about her is neat , delicate . Very small hands , tiny little feat . Is she a midget , then ? Sorry . - I suppose she 's very ladylike . - Well , yes . At the mission , sometimes the boats brought fashionable magazines from England . Months out of date , of course . They 'd have articles on flirting and how to be popular . But my uncle was the only one around so I never got to practise . - What ... what are you doing ? - I 'm going for a swim in your fianc ée 's lake . Come on ! Uh ! It 's colder than it looks ! Ooh ! Ooh ! # With a cat-like tread , # # upon our way we steal # # In silence dread # # Across the spray we feel # It 's so beautiful here . Would you mind staying so much if it wasn 't for Gladys ? Probably not . Oh , drat ! Father , let me kill them now . Achille , no . Let me kill them . - Can 't you shut them up ? - How would I do that ? It 's spooking the Indians . They don 't understand why you 're protecting them . Padre Mendoz is wrong ! Shut up , I forbid it ! - Not long ago , they were trying to eat you . - I was a source of protein . Ed ... Edward ! The village ! Shut up ! - Leave them alone . - Don 't interfere , for God 's sake ! Thank heaven for that ! Man-killer ! Run ! Man-killer ! Get your weapons ! Run ! Run ! - They were calling them . - Yes , they were calling them ! Do you see what you 've done ? Your meddling could have destroyed this village . I hope you know that . - What are you doing ? - Do you have your knife ? Agnes , Edward . Get out of there ! Let 's get you out of here . - John , give me your knife ! - Leave them . Just give me the knife ! Other side ! Come on . Why don 't they move ? Run ! Run ! Now is surely the time for the elephant gun . Marea ! Come on . Watch out ! It 's up to you now , Edward . You can do it . Not yet . For God 's sake ! I said not yet . Other barrel . Wait ! Fire now . Fire , Edward . Shoot the bloody thing ! You 're not bad . - Is anybody hurt ? Well done ! Are you all right ? Well done . Dirty work . What now ? I 've cleared the debris from the cave . We 're through . We can leave ! Elementary chemistry . But together , of course , they make a very effective explosive . I had no idea it would work . I 'm a palaeontologist , not a mining engineer . I remembered reading about the Kimberly diamond mines and how they used a small charge to clear blockages . Charcoal and guano ! Ha ! Oh . What happened here ? You were right my son . - I don 't think we 're safe here any more . - Right . Wait here . The white men have brought death and destruction . Achille , they are not to blame . Can 't leave you behind . He is not Padre Mendoz . He is the devil ! - Marea , come with me . - Come on ! Marea ! John ! Don 't move him ! Go ahead . I 'll take my chances here . I 'll cover you . - Go ! - Come on . - We can 't ... - We 've no choice . Come on ! Achille , stop ! Sorry , old chap , you have to let them go . Hurry . This way ! Oh , thank God ! We 're back in the REAL world . We 've got some way to go yet , Leo , before we 're home . We 'll have to move on . I don 't know how long Roxton can hold them back up there . ... and a time to die ... - Uncle ! Agnes ? Agnes . Heh ! Yes ... it 's me . Careful . - It 's all right . We 're safe now . Yes . No thanks to you . - It was the apemen , wasn 't it ? - God created man in his own image . In the image of God , He created him . They are not human . How could they be ? That 's why you stranded us there , and why you blow the cave up all those years ago . Uncle , you must come back with us to the mission . No , I must stay here . God has spoken to me . I mustn 't let anyone find that place again . You can 't seal off the truth as easily as you sealed off the cave ! The Devil made that place . It is no part of God 's kingdom ! Reverend , listen to me . You have to come back with us . No one 's ... no one 's coming back . - The man 's deranged ! - Bonkers ! " And he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life . " - " And man became a living soul . " - For God 's sake ! I have seen my work ruined , been attacked by dinosaurs , almost eaten by apemen . Now I am going home to my family and YOU are not going to stop me ! LEO ! Let go ! Leo . Thirty years is a long time to live with doubt . Will God forgive me ? He 's a merciful god , isn 't he ? " We buried Reverend Kerr at the foot of the plateau and delayed our departure for as long as we dared in the hope of Roxton 's escape . " " Alas , our wait was in vain , and with heavy hearts we began our long journey home . " We 'll rest here for a while . We MUST get on ! Agnes , I am SO sorry . That wasn 't my uncle back there not the man I knew . He died for his beliefs , one must acknowledge that . Professor . I think I can announce we are about to be rescued . " The Challenger Expedition " ? Be careful with that box ! Be very , very careful . It is EXTREMELY fragile . Over here ! - Professor Challenger ! - A word for the press , sir ? Congratulations , sir . The world is wild with curiosity since the arrival of your dispatches . Gentlemen , my colleagues and I are under exclusive contract to The Daily Gazette . You look thin . You haven 't been eating well . - Not terribly well . - I feared as much . I 've asked cook to prepare toad-in-the-hole followed by steamed treacle pudding . In all the years we 've been married , you haven 't said anything more delightful ! Children ! How you 've grown . Congratulations ! Well done ! Hadn 't you better go ? You must be desperate to see her . Yes . Yes . - Goodbye , then . - Goodbye . Thanks . Agnes . Malone ! Capital work , laddie . Arkwright himself couldn 't have done better . Lord Brass says it 's the most exciting thing he 's ever read ! - Thank you , Mr McArdle . - Call me Horatio ! You must be Agnes . I 'm Hilda Summerlee . - Nice to meat you . - Very nice to meat you . El Dorado ! And I 'm not just talking about the newspapers . No expense will be spared to bring these creatures over here . This will be the biggest thing since Buffalo Bill came to Earls Court . - Professor Challenger won 't agree to this . - We don 't need his permission . - Come on ! Lord Brass wants to meat you . - There 's someone I must see . Very well . Then I 'll see you at the Professor 's lecture . Thanks very much , sir . Edward . - You should have said you were coming . - I wanted to surprise you . You certainly have . - I thought you might have been at the docks . - I couldn 't make it . Edward , this is Mr Arthur Hare . Arthur , this is Edward Malone . I 've been following your exploits with the Challenger expedition in The Gazette . How magnificent ! - You must be very brave . - Not especially . Forgive me , might it be possible for me to have a moment alone with Miss Illingworth ? I 'm not sure that would be appropriate , what with Gladys being my fianc ée . - Fianc ée ? - Indeed . Are you going to congratulate us ? - This is a little sudden . - It was a whirlwind romance . I ... I ... swept her away . - I named a lake after you . - A lake ? That was very sweet . - Congratulations , Mr Hare . - Thank you . You are indeed a very lucky man . Ah ... You seem to be taking this very well , Edward , but ... Promise me you won 't do anything rash . I promise . Gladys , I wish you all the happiness in the world . I really do . And thank you . Mr Hare , would you describe yourself as the heroic type ? Heroic ? Me - Lord , no . More the solid , plodding , boring sort . Still , it seems to be what Gladys wants . Professor ! - Why is it " The Challenger Expedition " ? - Have you seen Agnes ? Agnes . I don 't think she 's coming . She 's finding London crowds a little daunting . - What IS in that damned box ? - You 'll see . Ladies and gentlemen . Ladies and gentlemen ! Not so very long ago , I stood in this same hall and announced that creatures once thought to have been extinct for millions of years still roamed the Earth . Well , I was branded a fraud and a liar . And my enemies had even worse things to say about me . Tonight , you will learn what we found in our lost world . Prepare yourselves to be amazed . It 's as much your triumph as theirs , my dear . They 'll take ALL the credit if you let them . Ladies and gentlemen an extraordinary story , you will say . But I 'm not asking you to simply take my word for it . Will you believe the evidence of your own eyes ? Mr Malone , your assistance , please . Edward . Edward ! I love her . - I 'm in love with Agnes . - Of course you are . She 's a delightful girl . - Could she love me ? - How would I know ? Why not ask her yourself ? Come on ! Come on , sweetheart . Ladies and gentlemen ... I present " Pteranodon summerleensis " ! Ooh ! - We must get a photograph . - No photographs , please . I said no photographs , please ! Please return to your seats . Please ! As the President of the Royal Society , I insist that this creature be restrained ! Everybody , please sit down ! - Control this creature ! - Somebody close that window ! Professor Challenger ! I 'll answer all your questions later . Now please leave ! Professor ! - Did you find any gold on the plateau ? - Please ! Was there evidence of mineral resources ? Shut up ! Come on , sweetie ... Taste the bacon . - Did you find Lord Roxton handsome ? - How much time did you spend together ? Please remain calm ! Ladies and gentlemen , please ! This is what it will be like . What chance will they have if we say where the plateau is ? - They 'll be freaks in a sideshow . - It 's beyond our control . Not yet it isn 't , Professor . They 'll destroy everything . You 're going to be the most famous creature in the world . Please come back ! Professor , you must listen ! You idiot ! Get out of my way ! We have the finest animal handlers ready to set sail . Rather ... - Rather a good trick , don 't you think ? - Well done , Professor . - I never thought we 'd fool them . - An Amazonian vulture cleverly made up ... I assure you THAT was no vulture ! - Are you both mad ? - Unless we stop this , the plateau is doomed . They won 't survive contact with the outside world . - You can 't stop progress ! - This is what you call progress ? Remember what happened when we interfered before ? Roxton was right . We brought disaster to them . How much worse will it be this time ? He 's right , George . I can 't do this . I can 't ! This is my chance to go down in history , shoulder to shoulder with Galileo , Newton , Pasteur . I 'll be one of the great men of science . No ! I 'm sorry , I won 't do it . Ladies and gentlemen . Ladies and gentlemen , I can assure you ... Ladies and gentlemen - dinosaurs ! You didn 't honestly believe me , did you ? I mean , this is the twentieth century ! Professor Illingworth , you didn 't fall for it , did you ? Not for a second . Nobody who 's acquainted with the Amazonian vulture could have been fooled by such a cheap trick . What about your reports in The Gazette ? Extracts from my new novel . Is there a publisher in the house ? Nonsense , all nonsense ! - What 's happened ? - It was a hoax . They didn 't see anything . This reporter fellow , Malone , his articles in The Gazette - pure fiction . Made the whole damn thing up ! - What you did was ... - Stupid , I know . ... heroic . You look beautiful . Shouldn 't you be paying compliments to Gladys ? Er , the thing is , she ... The thing is , she ... She 's thrown me over . I ... I don 't mind . In fact I 'm glad , because because I love YOU . Gladys has turned you down , so now you love me . No . No . Look , I 've never loved Gladys . I thought I did , but I 've loved you it seems since well , forever . Agnes , I thought ... I hoped you might have felt something for me . I hope you don 't think I 'm uncivilised for kissing you first , Mr Malone . You 'll have to teach me how society ladies behave . I think I like you exactly as you are . They would have crowned us in laurels , Leo . They 'll never take our work seriously again . Society can be forgiving . We have powerful friends in the academic world . - It 'll be easy to restore his reputation . - What about mine ? Well , I never wanted a silly chair at Oxford , anyway . Too much paperwork . It won 't be long before you astonish the world with some new discovery . Funnily enough , someone has sent me a rather interesting map . If it 's genuine , it could lead me to the exact location of the lost city of Atlantis . Goodbye , Leo . George , when you 're next in London , come and have dinner with us . I might be some time , but thank you . Well . You got your answer , then . What are you going to do now ? Well , I suspect my career as a journalist is over , so I thought I might try my hand at a bad novel . Just what the world needs ! Professor , if you need any help with your next venture ... I 'll be in touch . " Lord John Philip Roxton lived as he died : A man of action . " " He craved the wide horizons , the dangers of the world 's unexplored territories . " " Not for him the comfort and routine of a home with wife and children . " " In a life full of courageous acts , his greatest was at the end to lay down his life for his friends . " " He will remain forever in our hearts . "

 From the darkness to the daylight . The world could die and we don 't care . We build a dream of life that we can 't deny . If you say that you believe , so will I. Everybody under pressure . You could be the one to save us all It 's the love that we must revive . Take a chance and make it come alive . Genius of fools stole the day . Everybody 's trying to find themselves a life somehow , some way Don 't let your tears run dry . Some feelings never die . Our healing hands will pull you out of the fire . One voice will ease your mind . So let me carry you until you fly We 'll be building castles in the air . If you want me to , I 'll take you there . From the wreckage of a lifetime . The crying from a lonely avenue . From all the fear the city seems so still . We stand alone on this shadowed hill . Look in the mirror , you don 't have to take it . All you got to do is say the word . Your wings of love will carry you tonight . Trust in me , we 'll be all right . Genius of fools stole the day . Everybody 's trying to find themselves a life somehow , some way Don 't let your tears run dry . Some feelings never die . Our healing hands will pull you out of the fire . One voice will ease your mind . So let me carry you until you fly We 'll be building castles in the air . If you want me to , I 'll take you there Don 't let your tears run dry . Some feelings never die . Our healing hands will pull you out of the fire . One voice will ease your mind . So let me carry you until you fly We 'll be building castles in the air . If you want me to , I 'll take you there Don 't let your tears run dry . Some feelings never die . Our healing hands will pull you out of the fire . One voice will ease your mind . So let me carry you until you fly We 'll be building castles in the air . If you want me to , I 'll take you there

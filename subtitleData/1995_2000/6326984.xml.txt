" Race Cheshire stood at the edge of a battlefield . " " Dominance reached without any ship to be launched . " We attack at the genetic level . " The edge of a battlefield . " E struggle between human DNA and alien . To succeed must not attack a ship . Earn fight right here at km 0 . And use an innocent child . A child , Eddie . Hi , my name is Cade Ashby , I would like to ask you some questions . - Whatever you sell , sorry ... - It 's about your daughter What about my daughter ? I think I might be in danger . My daughter is dead . I do not think . Mi-seven . Why do not you give a run events , get me a cappuccino ice . Okay . Be right back . What happened , Nikki ? Cat got your tongue ? Does Not . They say ... no , Julia . No , Julia . What nice hair ... Thank you ... Julia . But Vogue says that no wear long hair . - How about a haircut ? - No , please , no ! Only a little . What you have reason to believe that my daughter is alive ? I work at the Academy Bradbury , where there 's student named Julia Hartman . I found a death certificate in her file name Julia Loomis . Was your last name I do not see how that 's possible . I know this is painful for you , and I 'm sorry . But can you tell me under what circumstances your daughter died ? It was a beautiful baby . Intelligent ... Lively , Then one day when he was 4 years old , became ill . I took her to the pediatrician immediately . What was his name ? It was the " and " . Doctor Prudence Kelly . Anyway , she was diagnosed with a rare viral disease ... Within a week he died . Sorry to ask , but you saw your daughter 's body ? The virus was contagious . The last time I saw her was when I took her to the hospital . It 's beautiful . Looks like the young Bradbury . The same smile , same eyes . - I think it would be better to leave . - Come and check Bradbury . I buried my daughter 13 years ago . I know it 's a shock . Am Visat , according to Ashby . For years I dreamed that is alive , and that it was all a terrible mistake . And the last thing I need is vain hope . That 's not the vain hope . I think your daughter will be stolen . Please leave . - I 'm trying to help . - Before I call the police . Sorry . If it is returning to the team , sorry coach . It 's about you . I 'll be straight with you , Julia . I came to Bradbury , to teach sport . I came to find out how you burned that boy . Who are you ? I am someone whose life was destroyed by the same people which you want to change you . You talk in charades . Sister Kelly , you said that your mother abandoned you ? - Yes . - He lied . I saw your mother this morning , her name is Megan Loomis . - Get away from me . - It 's not drunk . - And you thought dead . - Stay away ! I saw your file , Julia . Vaccines , pills , think it 's normal ? It 's normal to be an outcast ? It is normal to hear so many insults and whispers , you come to think when you say you 're strange you 're different , you 're a loser . Sister Kelly 're used in an experiment . Do not say anything about sister Kelly , is the only friend I have . It 's not your friend . Get out ! You 'll be sorry . Good job ... Coach ! His name is Cade Foster 's recommendations are all false . I knew something was wrong . She was too curious for a sports teacher . Council says Foster escaped from a military experiment of Chicago . And watching us all the important experiments in the country . They sent an assassin to kill him . He survived ? It appears to be resourceful . I came here last night and found the window open . It may have looked in the infirmary . If sought , is a threat to the entire experiment . You must get rid of it carefully . The last thing we need is to draw attention to ourselves . Especially after the incident with the boy in the hall . The aim was to take random people and turn them LEA genes . It was risky from the start . Tell that management Gua , I 'm sure they 'll have mercy . Hey , we are soldiers , execute orders . So how do we proceed with Foster ? We follow protocol experiment . A submission to test at the end of the mutation . A test of faith . Julia has received assay . To kill Cade Foster . You lied when you said my mother abandoned me ? Ashby coach told you that ? He told me that my mother thinks I 'm dead . Mr. Ashby is a liar . That 's not even his real name . This is a criminal . What does he want from me ? He wants to take you away from me . What ? Sweetheart ... Do you have any skills that few people understand , that makes you dangerous to people like Cade Foster . I do not understand . Julia ... You are chosen to help us lead the world to a new was glorious . I am your mother Even if I do not I gave birth . ... I 'm the one who really loves you , the one who gave you the true family . What is my real family ? Forgive me , but I 'm a little confused . You 'll understand soon . But before that I need to know something . Do you love me ? - Of course I love you . - Do you trust me ? Da . You agree to test your allegiance to the new family , then everything will be clear ? Da . When I looked into her eyes I saw another person . Alien DNA must be started gradual process . Now take control . The only way to stop him , it is the sister Kelly prevent them longer to injections . Let me tell you something about sister Kelly . I 'll strangle the bitch that I look like a dissolve . Calm down , I know you 're upset . I know this is most unfortunate experiment that I saw him do it . That 's genetic rape . You have to keep your eyes on the prize . You have to convince Julia to surrender . Who to surrender , Eddie ? You 're the one that I keep saying that we can not trust the government . Or anyone else for that level . Type the LA Times . The guy who read our website . Julia is clear evidence that we need to convince him to write a great article . He could tell her side of the story ... - And to show her skills alien . - The question is , how convincing ? - It could be a way . - How ? These aliens are trying to defeat us at the genetic level , right ? From a strategic perspective , it is a very good plan . One really good . But there 's one thing they forgot . Foster ? Hello ? Foster ? Damn ! Hi , Julia . What did you want to talk to me ? Kelly sister told me about you . Cade Foster . You said your mother true ? Do not talk about my real mother . You said that your mother felt when he thought you were dead ? - Shut up ! - Kill , Julia . Julia ? I did not think you live , until I saw this . You lied to me . You disappoint me , Julia . You have to kill myself . If you have a chance to save humanity , condemning one person , would you do it ? That was the question that I hit , if Julia Loomis . I could convince her to go to the reporter from Los Angeles , to tell her about the experiment that almost turned it into a monster . But then I thought about the consequences . A still life destroyed by a curious public and a government that would analyze it , would study it and would close it . Poor Eddie had a nervous breakdown when I told him . But he never met Julia . My decision to destroy records and Julia let her live in peace , was based on one thing , that aliens have forgotten . The fact that people are not only made of flesh , blood and DNA . There is something intangible , something that can not be measured in tubes or in laboratories . Tell soul , or tell her spirit . It 's an advantage we have in the battle ahead .

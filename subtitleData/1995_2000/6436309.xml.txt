 You make man . No . Woman . MONSTER : Woman ? THEME SONG : Weird Science . Ooh . Pictures from a magazine . Diagrams and charts . Mending broken hearts . And making weird science . Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces . This is my creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . Ooh . My creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold . Just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Ooh . My creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! [ WHIMPERS ] Hey , Cori . Ready for our big cyber date ? Online and waiting . I brought you some flowers . They 're beautiful . Where did you find flat black and white flowers this time of year ? [ CHUCKLE ] I like this girl . My jeep is not a port-a-potty . You 've dropped your last payload , boys . This time I 'm ready . Tell your friends , Chett 's coming . You 're smiling . You 're bouncing . Online with Cori again , huh ? - Got the calluses to prove it . - Yeah . I 'd be proud . When are you going to meet her in person ? Never . This is the ' 90s . Cyber dating is cool . No risk . No rejection . No watching their faces drop when they finally see me with my shirt off . One crisis at a time . Take a chance . Ask her out on a real date . Eh . Human contact 's over rated . Maybe I 'll try a joy stick . WYATT : A real date . In person . What do you say ? I hope we 're doing the right thing . Relax . Gary really likes Cori . He 's just scared . He 'll thank me for this . Like the way he thanked you for making me give him skunk glands . Hey , we got a B in bio . Would have been an A if the teacher hadn 't spooked him . Ooh . She 's answering . This is really exciting . Gary , I thought you 'd never ask . I 'd love to meet you in person . He shoots . He scores . I did it . We did it . Hey . What are you guys doing ? We asked Cori on a date for you . She said yes . You did what ? You guys have ruined my life forever . Why are you so afraid to meet this girl ? You want to know . I 'll show you . This is Cori . So . She 's cute . And this is me . You sent her a picture of a different guy ? A handsome guy . This guy isn 't any better looking than you are . Are you kidding ? He 's got the look . He 's in a magazine . Oh , he 's pierced . Can I keep this ? So basically , your relationship with Cori is built on a lie . It was just one lie , wasn 't it ? At first . But one lie leads to another until she thinks I invented the wonder bra , drive a Maserati , and play the yellow Power Ranger on TV . Boy , you really told some whoppers . Now , because of you guys , she 's going to find out what a lying little weasel I really am in person . I thought the yellow Power Ranger was a girl . I really feel bad about this . Good . Is there any way I can make it up to you ? Nope . I 'll give you five bucks . It 's a start . Gary , I figured out a solution to your dating problem . Thanks , Lis . I 'm not that desperate . It 's not for you . It 's for Cori . It 's a puppet . Where are the strings ? We don 't need strings . We 've got a remote . Hey . It 's the guy from the picture . Just call me Geppetto . I don 't get it . Geppetto was Pinocchio 's dad . I know that . I don 't get how this helps me . Hi , Cori . My name 's Gary . I 'll be your date for the evening . Blink . Smile . Pucker . Pucker . Oh , I think it 's the little knob on the right . Pucker . I think he 's ready . I 'll be the judge of that . If this guy 's going to wow Cori , he needs some of those famous Gary Wallace moves . Now , he 's ready . I 'm so glad you actually look like your picture . On the net , you never know what you 're going to get . Yeah . You got to be careful though . A lot of desperate horny losers out there willing to do anything for a date . Not me though . What you see is what you get . Oh , yum . This looks great . I love Chinese food . Me too . Best part about it , it 's really fun to say Kung Pao . Moo goo gai pan . Poo poo- - Platter . [ GIGGLING ] I 'd like to welcome all you pigeons aboard flight 107 , your captain today is Chett Donnelly . Your destiny , hell . [ COOING ] Thanks for dinner , Gary . I had great time . Me too . Maybe we can do something again sometime . Do you mean face to face without a keyboard ? I don 't know . WYATT : You kissed ? Yeah . And not some wimpy thanks a lot , now get the hell out of my life . This was major tongue aerobics . She kissed the puppet . Yeah . It was perfect . Moonlight . Warm summer air . It 's got to be love . Gary , she kissed the puppet . Yeah , I know that- - Puppet . Oh man . This puppet guy thing sucks . Looks like you 're going to have to tell Cori the truth . Are you kidding ? It 's time for plan B. Tomorrow night , I get puppet guy here to introduce Cori to his best friend and Mr. Right . Me . Cori , I 'd like you to meet my best friend and all-around good guy , Grover . Nice to meet you , Grover . Uh , my friends call me Nick . But that never stuck , so Grover it is . I thought you two should meet . Grover here 's one of the greatest guys around . He 's smart , sexy , athletic , and funny . Ha , ha , ha . Ha ha . I mean how can you resist him really ? I wouldn 't blame you if you dumped me and walked out here with him right now . I mean look at this beautiful brute . Can 't compete with this action . Hold on to this one . He 's a keeper . Excuse me a sec . Stop . You want to get her to like you . Don 't you ? Just tone it down a little . OK . Gary , are you OK ? We 've got a man down on the field . Power nap . What do you say we go for a drive ? [ THUNDER ] You may want to turn those wipers on , Gary . Headlights wouldn 't kill you either . Whoops . My bad . That 's the radio , big guy . There you go . Radio . Headlights . There are too many buttons in these cars . Uh-oh . What ? Tunnel . Tunnel ? BOTH : Tunnel ! WYATT : We 're losing the signal . [ STATIC CRACKLING ] [ CAR HORN BEEPS ] This guy loves to nap . I 'm sorry about that tunnel thing . Oh no . That 's OK . Those concrete dividers steered the car for you . It 's all my fault . I 'm a walking medical defect . I 'm not fit to date . Grover here though . Man , is he in great shape . Firm definition . Tight abs . [ GRUNT ] I think she gets the picture . Thank you . I 'm worried about Gary . I don 't think he 's well . He gets that way . Listen . Maybe we could go out some time . Just the two of us . How can you think about that right now ? What about Gary ? He 's fine . How 's Satur- - Uh-oh . You did that on purpose . Who are you talking to ? I 'm OK . Really . Ready to go , Fozzy ? Grover . Whatever . That 's it . You 're coming inside . You can spend the night here . Oh . Give me a break . And why don 't you go crawl back under your rock ? I don 't know why you 're friends with this guy . You 're obviously not well . And all he cares about is hitting on me . It 's sick . Come on . I 'll take care of you . Hey . Did you have a nice evening ? BOTH : Oh yeah . And I got the calluses to prove it . I always end up the big loser in these things . But this time , that 's not going to happen . Lis , I want you to turn me into that guy . You want me to make the puppet a real boy ? Forget about making him a real boy . I just made him a man . Lisa , Cori wants this guy . So I got to be this guy . It 's the only way this is going to work . OK , Gare . If that 's what you want . That 's what you get . Gary ? Is that you in there ? It 's me all right . Only now , I 've got the look . Lisa , what did you do ? I put Gary 's mind in the puppet 's body . He 's in control now . Huh . Well , I guess we don 't need this anymore . Uh , Lise , where is Gary 's body ? LISA : Hm . Well , I 'm sure it 'll turn up . Hi . Is this your locker now ? Why . Yes , it is . What happened to the other guy ? Why , you , uh , miss him ? Kind of . All I had to do is smile , and he gave me anything . His lunch money , his homework , his car keys . Ha . What an idiot . You said it . [ SIGH ] I guess when you 're good looking , you can get away with that kind of stuff . Like I need to tell you that . I 'm in the club . Oh . This baby 's got it all . Motion sensitive targeting system , self-arming sidewinders , multiple-head nuclear payload . I think it 's time to feed the birdies . Pigeon command , we are clear for takeoff . [ EXPLOSION ] Sorry , Mr. Patterson . Are you feeling all right , Gary ? You 're not tired ? Nope . I 'm feeling great . Gotcha . [ LAUGHS ] It 's hard to believe we 've only been out three times . I mean I feel so comfortable with you . There 's something special happening here . You know , I think it 's because our relationship is so honest . Lying 's just not my style . Gary , is everything OK ? What ? Sure . Yeah . Uh . Where was I ? Something about how lying 's not your style . Right . Right . I 've always thought that the best way to get to know someone is to let them get to know me . No games . That 's so true . Tell me something . Do you like poetry ? Yes . I knew it . I could tell . Um . I 'll be right back . Don 't go anywhere . I 'll be right here . Thinking of you . Excuse me . Hey , stud puppet . How 's your romantic evening ? What the hell ? They 've turned into wood . It 'll be OK . Oh yeah . Sure . We 'll keep on dating . Eventually get married . Maybe one day build a house out of my legs . Calm down . It 's just the Pinocchio syndrome . The what ? The Pinocchio syndrome . You know how Pinocchio 's nose grew . Well , every time you tell a lie you 're one step closer to being a real puppet . I wasn 't lying . Oh man . I 'm going to wind up one big Lincoln log . There is a way out . My dad 's got a belt sander . Look . All you gotta do is stop lying and start telling the truth . And everything will go back to normal . Stop lying . I can do that . I 'm an honest guy . Toasty . [ CHUCKLING ] Yeah . I 'm sorry I took so long . But there 's something I wanted to do for you . You 're going to think I 'm so corny , but here . I wrote something for you . Could you open it for me ? It 's more romantic that way . Now , I want you to tell me what you think . Be honest . Honest ? [ SIGH ] This is so sweet of you . Well , what do you think ? It 's really rhymy . Sigh , sky . Easy on the ear . Well , do you think it 's good ? Cori , I 've got to tell you something . You know before when I told you I liked poetry , well , that was- - An understatement ? More like a lie . I don 't like- - I hate poetry actually . I just wanted to impress you . Oh . Well , I am impressed . It is nice to meet a guy who 's not afraid to tell the truth . Huh . Well , as a matter of fact , I 've been lying about all kinds of stuff . You have ? Oh yeah . Like for example , I didn 't ask you on that first date . My buddy Wyatt did . Yes ! Yes , he did , because I was scared to death to meet you in person . I felt that I had to build myself up so you 'd like me . And that stuff about me inventing the wonder bra . Lie . Everything I said was a lie . I didn 't really take a bullet for the president . Hell , I don 't even know who the president is . And this scar , didn 't get it from a shark bite . Nope . Peels right off . See . And the biggest lie of all is I 'm not even me . Ha ha . I 'm a puppet . A puppet ? Don 't even ask me to explain that one . Well , you don 't have to . Huh ? You 're right . You are a puppet . I see it now . You do ? I mean we 're all puppets . We are ? Oh , that 's a beautiful metaphor . Gary Wallace , you may think you don 't like poetry , but you have the soul of a poet . Huh . Then , let 's not sit here and mope . Let 's go somewhere dark and grope . Oh , Gary . Pigeon flambe . Oh . [ FRENCH ] Tora . Tora . Tora . [ GEARS TURNING ] Come on . Gary , is something wrong ? Huh . No . Just had to stand . - Ready to go ? - Yeah . Yeah . Let 's do it . So what 's the deal there ? Someone must be operating on his frequency . [ GROAN ] What are you doing ? Pinched nerve . I 'm fine . WAITRESS : Watch it . What 's your problem ? [ GROAN ] Was that , like , a seizure or something ? I have no idea what just happened . Piece of crap . Help . Gary , are you OK ? Yeah . Yeah . I think so . Good . Good . That means you 're strong . You 're a survivor . Strong enough to beat this problem . With your help . Actually , no . Look . The napping , the twitching , the slamming into walls . It 's just too freaky for me . I 'm sorry , Gary . ( SCOTTISH ACCENT ) From hell 's heart I stab at thee , pigeons . Victory is mine . [ LAUGHING ] Swing it around . Where you going ? Bring her back . Bring her back . Please . Beverly , come on , baby . I 'm going back to lying . At least , I do it well . Good to see you learned your lesson . Yeah . I learned my lesson . The truth bites . Now , if you don 't mind , Lisa , I 'd like my old body back . Are you sure you don 't want to hang out in this one a little longer ? We could go see a movie . You don 't know where it is . Do you ? Come on , Wyatt . Let 's go find a paper . WOMAN : Well , I say we meet them there . Excuse me . Have you seen this body around ? Mm-mm . Anywhere ? THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips . Shooting from the hip . Something different . We 're making weird science . Ooh . Pictures from a magazine . Bits and pieces . Bit and pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand my intentions ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ]

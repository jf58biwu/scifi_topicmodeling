 [ Mechanical Whir ] [ Wind Whistling ] [ Hawkes ] What are you , looking to buy real estate ? Let 's go . There 's a war on . Load the gear . - First we secure our location . Low ? - Mm-hmm ? Our position ... is out in the middle of nowhere . They 're secured . Now unload this gear . - The HIST manual clearly states - - The manual ? When they drop you in the middle of a hairy fur ball ... you gonna take time to check the manual ? You do what you want . I 'll be happy to see you take one the minute we 're in battle . We do what we 're told . Oh , that 's right . Follow their rules . They 'll just keep taking from you , and you 'll let ' em . - [ Grunts ] - Hey ! - West , get off him . Hawkes . Hawkes . - Wait a minute , you guys . - [ Others Clamoring ] - [ Pagodin ] Help me get ' em apart . What the hell is wrong with you ? And you , knock it off . We have a mission to achieve . You think we 're going to blow it because you two need to butt heads ? We 're drivin 'on , so you two better get your heads screwed on right . Now , Low , tell West our position . Low ? [ Beeping ] We 're 45 degrees south , 271 west - the Hellas plains . That accounts for the sparse vegetation . They just started terra-forming this area . [ West ] The tracking drone is about four klicks from here . What should we do ? All right , grab your gear . Let 's move out . [ Panting ] [ Pagodin ] Hey , Coop . I can get up myself . Probably , but it looks like you could use a hand , and I 'm offering one . Ain 't easy for me to recognize a helping hand . If that 's a thank you , don 't worry about it . Someday you 'll pay me back . [ Shane ] Damphousse , replace the transceiver units ... and let 's go back . - We 've got about ten hours of sunlight . - [ Beeping ] - What 's this ? - That 's the Earth message . They made it a requirement that all off-Earth installations had to have one . It 's got pictures and sounds of Earth , in case an extraterrestrial found it . Mozart . - If only this had been our first contact with them . They would have never killed the colonists . - Whoa ! If they would have heard this first they would have wiped us out a long time ago ... - and I wouldn 't have blamed them . - Hey . - What the hell is that ? - I know this . I heard this in my 20th Century history class . They called this rock and roll . I think this group was called The Pink Floyd . They went like this - - Hey , ho , let 's go . - # # Hey , ho Let 's go # # - [ Laughing ] - # # Hey , ho , let 's go # # - # # # # [ Continues ] - [ Booming ] - Look ! What ? - [ Nathan ] Move out ! Move out ! - # # [ Continues ] # # [ Stops ] - Let 's go ! - [ Shane ] One , one thousand . Two , one thousand . - Three one thousand - - [ Crash ] On Mars , about ten miles away . Let 's do it . All right , we all go . Everyone carries water and their M-590s . Let 's do it . - All right . - Okay . - [ Man ] You got it ? - [ Woman ] Yeah . [ Shane ] Could be a Mars orbiter . - Maybe it 's a classified recon ship . - Something to do with the war . [ Shane ] Damphousse , Carter , West , Stone , Pags and me . The rest of you spread out , provide cover . - You don 't want me to go ? - Mm-mmm . You stay here in case something happens . Move out . - Radiation levels ? - [ Electronic Beeping ] Uh , let 's say we don 't stay long . [ West ] Can 't see anything . [ Vanessa ] What the hell is it ? Well , I can 't see a cockpit or anything . There 's no electronics . [ Grunts , Gasps ] [ Beeping ] - [ Groans ] - [ West ] Take cover ! Take cover ! [ Shane ] Move it ! Move , move , move ! - [ Shane ] Fall back ! - [ West ] Move out ! [ Shouts , Grunts ] Shane . ! [ Gasping ] Sit tight , West . I got you . You 're squared away . How 's Vansen ? Pressure 's stabilizing . - [ Shane ] Low is on . - Pags is dead . - [ Carter ] You all right , Vansen ? - [ Shane ] Yeah . Thanks . [ Electronic Whir ] [ Beeping ] West is solo . Damn it . What the hell is he doing ? You three move out with me . Rest of you stay here . [ Heavy Breathing ] [ Gunshot ] [ Groans ] [ Shane On Radio ] West ? [ Marines Chattering On Radio ] There it is . Stone , Carter , over here . [ Carter ] Stone , over here . [ Beeping ] I think it 's trying to surrender . I think it thinks we 're going to kill it . - [ Vanessa ] The odor 's gonna make me sick . - Smells sulfuric . Must be a scout - going toward Earth ... had to crank the chicken switch over Mars . - Probably sent a distress call . - That means there 'll be more coming . There 's got to be some way to figure it out . Don 't . It could carry some kind of disease . I never had a mother , but you sound like one . [ Growls ] Looks like it operates the vehicle - like a key . Yeah , some sort of encoded information . - What is this ? - [ Growls ] [ Cooper ] Him ? What does this have to do with him ? This is this ? It 's like a picture of his family or something . Maybe we ought to give it something to eat or drink . It wants water . Right . It 's probably one thing we have in common . - Let 's give it some water . - [ West ] What the hell is the matter with you ? We 're low on rations as it is , we 're cut to 30 % O2 flow ... and you guys want to waste water on this thing ? No . No way . This thing killed Pags ! God knows who else it killed . [ Air Lock Hisses ] I 'm giving it some water . Let 's show it what it means to be human . [ Gurgling , Groaning ] [ Cooper ] Not such a good idea . [ Gurgling , Groaning Stops ] [ Marines Murmuring ] [ Shane ] I can 't believe ... that it would be so afraid of us that it would kill itself . We 're the enemy . This is the first time I 've ever seen a dead body . Won 't be the last . # # # # [ " Taps " ] # # # # [ Continues ] # # # # [ Continues ] # # # # [ Ends ] [ Bougus ] Today you have been assigned ... your SA-43 endo-exo atmospheric attack jets . Your current orders are to take 48 hours ' leave . - Sir , ship us out , sir . - Sir , why have we been ... on accelerated training if we 're not going to be used , sir ? Listen . All we know is what you people found last week . We have no idea what lies ahead . We know basically nothing about the enemy - numbers , weapons , tactics . That 's why we have been losing ... and losing badly in every battle of this war . Don 't be in such a hurry . My advice - Go home . See your families . Could be the last time . Dismissed . Gonna go see your sisters ? I don 't think they want to see me . I don 't know if my parents want to see me . I never told them I was joining the Corps . They 'll want to see you . - Want to be a witness to that ? - [ Chuckles ] I 'll never get in one of those . - Ten of us Tanks were with the Tellus Colony . - [ Beeping ] Only makes the aliens just as bad . I 'm not going to die for them . What would you die for ? Nathan ? Mom , Dad , it 's Nathan ! - [ Boy ] Nathan . ! - [ Nathan ] Johnny . [ Grunts ] [ Johnny ] Come on . Nathan . Mom , Dad , this is my friend , Shane Vansen . It 's a pleasure , Mr. And Mrs. West . Dinner is - is almost ready . I was gonna give you a rock I pocketed on Mars ... but they took it . Come on inside . [ Nathan ] Hey , Neal . - Hey . - Shane , this is my brother , Neal . - Hi . - Hi . The TV said we 're about to begin another battle . I 'm here at the U.N. Task Force Headquarters ... at Vandenberg , California , receiving the latest reports - I heard the alien fighters are made of some unknown metal - that we can 't harm it . We 've only started reverse engineering on the one we found . It 's just rumors . Kylen 's brother told us - [ Announcer ] ... offiicial dispatch of the elite Marine Corps ... fighter squadron , the 127th ... better known as the Angry Angels , which left their base ... in Loxley , Alabama , sometime last evening . This is , without a doubt , the largest mobiliyation of Unified Earth force - It doesn 't seem like we can win . Don 't worry . This time out we 'll beat ' em . - How do you know ? - Well , because this time ... they 're going up against the 127 th - the Angry Angels . They will knock the enemy into Andromeda . [ Announcer ] ... seen from the Earth in the Northern Hemisphere ... about 50 degrees above the southeast horiyon . [ Footsteps ] Uh - Pags ... um ... I wanted to say something to you when they buried you ... but I don 't know what . And now that I 'm here , I still don 't . Besides , they don 't let anybody say anything at those things anyway . I guess I just wanted to say ... you were the only guy that was ever okay to me . I wish - I just wish , somehow , you could ... just feel my insides and know . Maybe right now you can . I doubt it . I wish I knew what you were feeling right now . See , I thought I knew what it would be like ... but seeing you up there ... all ... blood ... I just - I wish I could know if anything 's worth it . - [ Explosions ] - [ People Shouting , Screaming ] [ Man On TV ] Earth-based forces report major casualties . Here , on the U.S.S. Yorktown , the 127th Airborne ... known as the Angry Angels , are engaging the enemy and meeting heavy resistance . There 's smoke , electrical flashes . You can hear the metal buckling in the bow of the carrier . [ Explosion ] [ Electrical Siyyling , Silence ] - It 's over . - [ Beeping ] [ Woman On Com ] Attention , all aviators ... of the Marine Corps Aviators Cavalry . You are to report immediately to base for active duty . Repeat : M.C.A. Pilots ... are to report to base by 0630 for immediate active duty . [ Shane ] Nathan . Our orders are in . Any idea where we 're heading ? Damphousse said we 're going straight to the line . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Man ] We 've got the 127 th coming in . [ People Shouting ] [ Man ] They 're bringing in the Angels . The 127 th . Ten-hut ! Be seated . The information you 're about to receive is classified level red . I don 't need to remind you of the consequences of divulging class red information . 58th , because of you ... we 've caught a break - a major break . Within the wreckage of the alien recon vehicle ... you recovered during your HIST ... was an encoded transmission detailing the enemy 's projected battle objectives . Subsequently , all enemy movements have been anticipated . Fearing that the captured information may be deceptive ... we have not shown our hand ... until now . The Earth is here . The enemy intends to attack with extreme intent ... two-thirds of its forces , at the Groombridge 34 Star System Naval base ... in 71 hours . This is known as point " G. " The Earth forces ... the greatest mobilization of military might since the 20th century ... will surprise attack from behind enemy positions ... at two points , point " F , " here , and point " H , " here . The Marines will participate with the 8th Air Wing . This will be possible ... due to a fortuitous projected wormhole opening in the Galileo regions . From the captured information , we have ascertained ... their planes are faster , with a greater rate of climb : Ours are more maneuverable and better armed . It evens out . Surprise has been their best weapon . Now it 's ours . It 's too easy . Sir , if the plans weren 't planted ... then they at least would assume we have them . No doubt their intelligence informed them we would be unable to decipher the transmission . And , in fact , it has taken ... fifty Quantum Charno computers interlinked on four continents ... to decode the enemy 's complex language . And , as mentioned , their movements have since ... been in accord with the captured plans . Sir , are deploying to point " F " or " H , " sir ? 58th Squadron will operate in a support capacity at point " A. " - Point " A " ? - Here . Rear left flank . [ Murmuring ] Sir , why bother telling us the plan if we weren 't going to be a part of it ? You are part of it - rear left flank . Sir , request permission to transfer to 8th Air wing . - Denied . - Sir , with all due respect , we have the right - Sit down , Lieutenant . 58th will report to the naval space carrier Saratoga across theJupiter line ... by 0840 tomorrow . You 'll meet your squadron commander on board . Dismissed . [ Engines Roaring ] [ Jets Roaring , Whistling ] Gold Leader confirm Saratoga position at 32.5 megastatute kilometers . [ Shane On Radio ] Come in , Gold Leader . Confirm . Just a minute . I 'm getting interference on the light LI DAR . [ Beeping ] Check six . I had a bogey on the HUD . Must have been an asteroid or [ Beeping ] - Red Leader . Confirm bandit or recon vehicle . Confirm , confirm . LI DAR 4 . - Alien bogey , 10 : 00 . - I 'll turn intercept angle 30 degrees . Blue Team , White Team , watch six . Hack . 12 : 00 high . He jinked . Scram ! Scram ! - Lost it . - Must be jamming our LI DAR . Went below us like a fish on the line . - [ Cooper On Radio ] Let 's go fishing . - Negative . Don 't have the fuel . Return to designated course . I 'll call Space Com and report A.C.M. With the enemy . [ Alarm Sounding ] [ Man On P.A. ] Hammerhead disengage sequence complete . [ Woman On P.A. ] Change bay doors . [ Overlapping Conversations ] Hey , hey . What 's going on ? They look a little harried . Ten-hut ! 58 , report to the briefing area immediately . Space Com checked out your report of the enemy recon vehicle . Radio telescopes have since found not only ... no trace of enemy troops in the Groombridge system ... but rather a force amassing outside our solar system . Enemy plans were a set-up . At this point , no one needs their plans ... to know which direction they 're headed . [ Background Chatter ] [ Man ] Ten-hut . ! Sit down . I want to be able to look into your eyes . Courage , honor ... dedication , sacrifice - These arejust the words they used to get you here . Now the only word that means a damn to you is " life " - Yours ... your buddies : The one certainty in war is that in an hour , maybe two ... you 'll either still be alive or you 'll be dead . For the next hour , here 's your best chance of staying alive . The Trojan asteroid belt trails Jupiter 's orbit . Our objective is to hide in the debris . This may be as diffiicult as engaging the enemy . You 're gonna have to react to the pitch and yaw of the asteroids ... in order to keep out of sight , shielded from LI DAR . Intelligence says they 'll fly right by - then jump ' em . Now , nobody 's asking you to wax their tails . Your goal is to stall them . Our forces at Groombridge 34 ... have doubled back , and are right now passing through the Collie wormhole . If we successfully delay the enemy ... we 'll have reinforcements appearing from behind them ... and out of the sun . And that 's when we teach them something every human knows - payback 's a bitch . Now ... I 'm here because I 've been in a knife fight with them . They come at you in groups . Check your six . And they have a low angle of attack , so keep your nose level . Planes you 've been issued have an " upgripe " in the retro-thrusters . One more thing . It 's okay to be scared . I 'll see you in an hour . [ Indistinct Conversations , Commands ] Hawkes . [ Man On P.A. ] Begin cockpit engage sequence . Cockpit engagement sequence complete . Cleared for launch . [ Woman On Radio ] Initiate launch sequence . [ Nathan ] There it is . Let 's get behind cover . [ Shane ] Coming in . Stay tight . Thrusters at ten percent . [ Shane ] Red Four , you 're too close . 9 : 00 ! [ Nathan ] Saratoga , this is Blue Leader . We 're tied on . Acquired position alpha . [ Control ] Affiirmative , Blue Leader . Commodore , the enemy forces have adjusted their course . If they continue , they 'll avert the asteroid field . Saratoga ... - LIDARshows the enemy to be - - Affiirmative , Blue Leader . - Will advise . - Advise ? They 're moving away . - Hold position . - Could they know we 're here ? No . They 'd attack . Something 's got to bring them our way . [ Man ] Negative . Hold your position . Wait him out . # # # # [ Rock ] # # # # [ Singing Along ] # Hey , ho , let 's go # # # Hey , ho Let 's go # # - # # # # [ Continues ] - One of the 58th has moved out of position . I 'm baiting them past you . - I 'm going to help him out . - [ Shane ] Negative , Blue Leader . Hold your position . He 'll bring ' em past . Wait till we all can go . I 'm going in . Fangs out . [ Weapons Firing ] They 're locked in . Approaching position . Stand by , Alpha Attack Wing . - [ Beeping ] - My control 's froze . [ Nathan ] They 're locking in on him . Kill the right thruster , you stupid Tank . [ Shane ] They 're coming in fast . More direct six . - Hurrah ! - [ Nathan ] That 's a kill . [ Vanessa ] Blue 4 , watch out . You got enemy tied on . [ Man ] I can 't shake it . [ Man Screams ] This is Red Leader . A little help . [ Nathan ] I 'm on it . [ Cooper ] I 'm losing thrust . They 're all over me . I can 't hold it . - [ Beeping ] - Hawkes , hit the deck . I 'm coming in head-on . - [ Cheering ] - [ Cheering ] [ Cooper ] Not so fast . Bandit locked on you , Shane . Check your six . I can 't shake it . West , I can 't get to her . [ Nathan ] She 's in my line . If I engage , I might hit her . Hurrah . - Popped ' im good , West . - I didn 't fire . Who got the kill ? Sir , the Groombridge forces are through the wormhole ... and are inflicting severe damage on the enemy . [ Control ] 58th , this is Command . Damage is nominal . Enemy in retreat . Return to base . Objective achieved . [ Whispering ] Yes . [ Secretary General ] Because of the valiant efforts ... of the Marine Corps 58th Squadron ... the many peoples of Earth will breathe a single sigh of relief ... and tonight , at their graduation ceremony ... we honor them . [ Applause ] I believe even the great leader of the 20th century ... Winston Churchill would agree - never ... in the field of conflict ... has there been so much owed by so many to so few . We of Earth ... are proud and grateful . Celebrate well . Although I suppose the break in the storm is momentary ... the thunder shall return ... and the lightning ... will certainly strike again . [ Overlapping Conversations ] - Thank you . - [ Chuckling ] [ Wang ] Can you believe it ? Hey . Here you go . We 're gonna have a toast . A toast . Congratulations . Sir , I - Those words that day , they kept us alive . Save it . You 'll have all the chances in the world to thank me . I 've just been assigned as your squadron commander ... and if you ever pull anything like what you did out there under my command ... the only medal you 'll be wearing are cuffs in the brig . At least he doesn 't yell . Here 's to Pags . - Here 's to being alive for one more hour . - Cheers . [ All ] To Pags . [ Nathan Narrating ] Elsewhere , stars are born . Other star systems , older , larger ... continue to breathe . The solar System dies of crib death . If that 's what it takes ... then okay . If I must wait that long , then all right . Because when I think of this ... nothing is more desirable than the hope ... of watching that last day , when the sun flickers out ... with you beside me . We 'll sit alone on a dark chunk of ice at the top of the world ... and the stars above ... beyond , and between us ... will never shine brighter as we drift away ... into space . [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

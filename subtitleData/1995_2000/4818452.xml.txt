 I have got the perfect present for you . - A present ? What for ? - Christmas . What , you didn 't get me anything ? No , are you kidding ? No , of c- - not get you anything ? Of course I got you something . I , uh ... I got you the perfect something . It 's perfect , and it 's , uh , it 's really something . You 're so sweet . All right , we are wired . - Can I plug it in ? Can I plug it in ? - Knock yourself out . - It 's magnificent ! - You ain 't seen Nothin ' yet . By the time I 'm through with this joint , they 're gonna be able to see it from the shuttle . Tommy ! - Look what I got . - A stick ? No ! It 's a Christmas tree ! You 'll see . All it needs is a little love . Dick ! Dick ! - You are not gonna believe what we got at the mall . - A stick ? It 's a Christmas tree ! That thing ? We are Solomons , Harry . We should have the biggest , noblest tree in all of Ohio . Forget the stick , Dick . We found jobs . The mall is full of them- - Christmas jobs . You are lookin ' at a professional gift-wrapper . And I am the executive assistant to Mr. Santa Claus . I 've heard of him . He 's the muckedy - muck in charge of the whole shebang . Yeah , well , I 'm kind of his right-hand elf . This is wonderful . It 's a celebration . - Tommy , when did we first land on this planet ? - January 9th . It was a Tuesday , exactly 8 : 30 P.M. 7 : 30 central . Do you realize we 're coming up on our anniversary ? An earth year on earth , and everything is finally coming together . It 's as if all of the earth were throwing us a party . Suddenly I feel so ... so ... human . Oh , guys ! Come here . Oh , great . Now it 's a stick . Weeds . Okay , Dick , it 's time to pick your secret Santa . It 's time to who for wha-wha ? - Pick a name- - that 's who you buy a present for . - Presents ? For Christmas ? The bowl is heavy . I 'm sorry , Judith . Let 's play secret Santa . Dr. Anthony ? I barely know him . Glansberg , Chilton , lanell- - Dick , you don 't get to choose your person . It 's random . You pick one name , and it 's a secret until the party . Oh ... well , I picked my name , and whoever it is hasn 't the foggiest idea . For now until the party , their life will be a Topsy-turvy labyrinth of mystery and intrigue . For the love of god , let him draw again . Well , hello-ho-ho , everybody , and welcome to Santa 's toyland . Presents , toys and fun for children one to 91 . Oh , uh , please note that children 16 to 91 should not sit on Santa 's lap . Damn ! Thank you , and have a happy and safe holiday from all of us here at the Rutherford galleria . Wow , you 've been shopping your butt off . Yeah . It 's Christmas , right ? Oh , it 's great , isn 't it ? People buying stuff , lugging bags around , maxing out their credit cards . It 's like everyone in the whole world is joined together to embrace financial ruin . - Merry Christmas . - Thank you , and have a happy and safe holiday from all of us here at the Rutherford galleria ! Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - Oh ! She 's coin-operated . She says she has the perfect gift for me , and I have no idea what to get her . Her name is August Lefler . Well , I don 't know August , but- - well , aren 't you supposed to have some kind of list or something ? Well , I 'm afraid I left my list up in the north pole . Oh , great ! Can 't you have your wife fax it to you or something ? I can 't screw this up ! Well , Tommy- - look , you want to make this August chick happy , you 're gonna have to drop some cold , hard cash , you know what I 'm Sayin ' ? On what ? Listen , pork butt , I need model numbers here . Get a haircut . You look like a girl . Again ? The root must be somewhere upstairs . Ooh , is that the gift you got for Judith ? Or ... whoever it was you happened to pick ? - Yes . - There 's a $ 20 limit . I know . I went a little over . A hundred and twenty dollars over . It 's easy to get carried away , isn 't it ? You know , a few years ago , I made a batch of my famous rum balls for Christmas . They were so popular that this year , just on a whim , I made 20 batches , enough for the whole department . Mmm . It 's funny that you would have that much rum around . - It 's the holidays , Nina . - Yes , Nina , it 's the holidays . My dad would go out and get the biggest Christmas tree he could find . We 'd go caroling , open our house to the neighborhood . All that sharing and generosity- - it 's so beautiful . Look how generous I am . I am Christmas ! - Hello , and happy holidays from all of us here- - - Where 's my package ? I 'm supposed to say the whole thing . Hello , and happy holidays- - excuse me . I was- - I was- - I was here first . Excuse me . I 'm just picking up . Hey , hey , come on , people . You 're supposed to be happy . This is shopping . Yeah , well , I 'm fed up . Where the hell 's January already ? What is wrong with you people ? This isn 't about buying gifts at all . This is about viciousness and ruthlessness and aggression , and ... usually I like all those things , but ... but now , it 's just really ruining Christmas . Just wrap ! All : aw-W-w ! Oh , don 't worry , boys and girls . Santa will be right back after he takes care of some personal business . On the toilet . Oh , what are they feeding these kids ? They weigh a ton ! Well , you know , I think part of the problem is we 're feeding ' em candy . Maybe if we could give them celery or some kind of- - oh ... Santa . What are you- - I mean- - it 's- - you- - no-o-o-o ! Dick : ♪ o Tannenbaum , o Tannenbaum ♪ ♪ that 's " Christmas tree " in German . ♪ - Now , this is a Christmas tree . - Hey , hey , buddy , can I help you ? Uh , no , thanks . I have a chain saw . - Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas , officer ! " Peace on earth , goodwill toward men " - - what a crock ! Nine hundred dollars in fines , and they confiscated your chain saw ? And have you ever felt a taser ? It 's not nearly as much fun as it looks . What a bunch of hypocrites ! Apparently , the Christmas spirit doesn 't apply when you 're trespassing and vandalizing . Oh , let 's face it , Christmas is a sham . How can humans take something like shopping , something pure and natural and good , and turn it into something so ugly ? This is not a holiday , this is torture . They know exactly what they want , but they won 't tell you . No-o-O . They make you guess . This is just so " earth . " Humans- - I don 't want to play any of their reindeer games . Choir : ♪ fa , la , la , la , la la , la , la , la ♪ - ♪ ' tis the season to be jolly ... ♪ - Oh , listen to them .

Not until you 've completed the following remedial assignment . - You will write a 15-page dissertation on wave physics and its relation to electromagnetic radiation . Oh , and a five-point bonus if you can tell me how the hell Santa delivers all those toys in one night . It 's to be typewritten and on my desk no later than 6 : 00 . - Tonight ? - But it 's December 23rd . Yeah , it 's Christmas eve eve . Ohh , it is ? Well , tough tinsel . Thank you and have a happy , safe holiday from all of us here at the Rutherford galleria . Bye-bye , now . - Hey , Tommy . - I finally found something for August . - Oh , perfume . Is this what she wants ? - I don 't know . - So I also got her a portable Cd player . - Oh , she likes CDs . I don 't know . So I got her earrings ... oh , yeah , and a cellular phone and a belt . How did you afford all this stuff ? - You know that jar of pennies I have in my room ? - Yeah . It 's where I hide Dick 's credit card . Bartender , two fingers , no fat . I believed in him . I thought we were bringin ' joy to the world . I was gonna move to the north pole to work in his toy factory . Well , look what the cat dragged in . You got a lot of guts comin ' in here , fat boy . Do I know you ? Oh , don 't get cute with me , Kringle . If that is your real name . Hey , what 's your problem ? You 're my problem ! So what are you gonna do ?

There will be no holiday cheer , Nina , while there 's work to be done . - On Christmas eve eve ? - I 'll need all the grades for my 10 : 00 class broken down and re - tabulated for the whole semester . - On Christmas eve eve ? - Yes . Dick , we need somebody tall to hang the boughs of holly . Fa , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , no . - I guess I 'd like the plaid- - - We 're out of everything but green foil and happy snowmen . - Well , it 's for my mom , so- - - You got your mom a dust miser ?

Uh , yeah . - I need this . - You 're welcome . Nina ... forget the work . Go to the party . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Have a good time . And Nina , m-merry Christmas . Merry Christmas , Dr. Solomon .

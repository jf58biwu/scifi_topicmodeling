I saw tentacles Gua transplantation in human flesh . Killing people as guinea pigs . I am at war . I 'm going to get off guard , just because your hands bled . I read your file . Your father was infantry and was killed in Vietnam . - I did not know . - You knew it was proposed Medal honor for having rescued two injured in his team ? I know it was shot in the neck in place to receive medals . It was a fucking war . Nobody knew what to fight for . I lost my brother there . That 's why I joined the NDA . - I tried to correct things , you know ? - Read my on file . - I became a murderer . - That 's your opinion about you ? I know it 's trite to talk today about heroism , but for me , a hero is someone who does not expect the end , fighting to the last breath . And that 's you , Cade ... A hero . You inspiration to every man in this base . - What do you want from me ? - Only a few days of interrogation . Perhaps you will say a few words when we decide to do it publicly . You 've done much more than you could ask him any individual . You gave us a chance to fight . Thank you for that . Calm down , man , am I ... - Eddie ? Where were you , Eddie ? - I hid , brother . This thing is false . It 's a game , man . It 's a trap . And the bomb and place . - There are aliens ? - There is no doubt . - I 'm glad you 're okay , Foster . - Good to see you , Eddie . - I knew this was crazy ! - I brought things . - Let 's get out of here . - Okay . - How did you find me here , Eddie ? - You do not think I follow ? I found the complex on the net . I slipped in a car deliveries . Come on ! - Back , Eddie ! - Drop it , Foster ! No ! Active sites We have done everything possible to find Eddie Namboulous . In hospitals ... Police and FBI all local agencies . Sorry , Cade . - I do not know what else we can do . - Try again . If you have an idea , let 's hear it . Eddie monitored some sites to find information about Gua . You must enter these sites to send an encrypted message - Explaining how to find me . - Gua will see and you will find here . - I think it 's worth the risk . - You can not evaluate this risk , Doctor . We owe it . You owe him . Cu agent Tomalin , camera de control . Tomalin is our expert in computers , but I must warn you , Cade . Your friend is probably dead . - It is an honor to meet you , Mr. Foster . - Cade looks for Eddie Nambolous . I tried to track down " Paranoid Time " looking profile page . Eddie 's impossible to find . It 's too good . - You must bring him to us . - How ? Let 's nuke sites they monitor . We start with the big ones police and hospitals . - As search engines find it . Exact . I will create a code by hackers , followed by Cade format . CADE . If netui monitors will wait encrypted format . - Using Morse code . That 's all I know . - I have a better idea . Placed on all sites specified . It appears that their program web page so that it will be deleted . Your code will direct to another site contact number . After that , everything depends on it . - Eddie finds him . - Let 's hope . Be calm . We aim . We listened . Are you in danger . See you on the fly , at two o 'clock in the morning . Take care . We supervise . That 's all . I sent an encrypted message . Now it is only a matter of time . It seems good . Thank you . Thank you very much . - Any luck ? - We will wait and see . I hope we will find it . The newspaper 's is great . - There is someone here . - We gotta get off the roof . Get away from her , Foster ! - Cade is an alien . - Back , Mitchell ! Foster , depart from Tomalin . Now ! - Do not move , alien fucking . - I 'm not an alien Foster . She is . It is a genetic duplicate . We can not let you jump off the roof ! For Gua ! So that 's how they die . Gua attempt on your life , because they changed their minds - Since you 're here ? - Maybe . I do not know what to think . It 's a reliable , Cade . Reliability ? I thought I was crazy when they first experienced myself . I thought I was punished for all those years I was a thief . Do not we deserve a better life . I did not deserve Hannah . And when you found out that aliens exist ? I decided that I would not lose her mind if I fight them . Now enough of this , Cade . You win . - Why do not feel peace ? - Exactly . Do not you understand ? You need to fight , you 're not experiencing grief and loss . Perhaps you feel that without war and with Eddie gone , you have nothing , but you can find solace , Cade . Can you find peace again if you really want . Want ? I want to breathe again . I want to feel safe . - But you 're safe here . - Not enough . Look into the future . You can live again . You can immediately begin to fight for it . - What the hell is going on ? - 5 hours ago , Gua tried to detonate a small nuclear device in navel Pentagon . Fortunately , this attempt failed . Do not misunderstand , people . We are at war . It was not clear when it will start , but the president now officially declared a state of alert . Get ready to make public . Nations must be with us . - How do you do that ? - With your help . - What do you mean ? - You are a true leader , Cade . Someone that will inspire people to unite against aliens . I thought you said that I finished the job . The public will need a hero . President asked to be you . - What the hell am I supposed to say ? - Be yourself and be well . Ladies and gentlemen , Cade Foster . Mr. Foster , an expert in aliens ... How close are we invasion ? You mean the second wave ? Do not know exactly when it will come , next month , next week or tomorrow , but I know it is inevitable ... - If you do not stop now the first wave . - We have even a chance ? Fight them for a year and a half . They weaknesses . Not our will power . I 'm sure we can win . " Paranoid Times " wrote everything I learned about Gua . My friend Eddie Namboulous published them . Without Eddie without people like Eddie , I could not get that far . If you come with me to fight against them , then Gua has already lost the war . Do you consider yourself victorious , sir ? No , not yet , but everything that has happened since I came here , washing my name , exposing aliens ... All this means that the sacrifice was worth it . - You were natural . - Thank you . I 'm serious . I feel like I already beat Gua . - You too optimistic . - How are you ? - Embarrassing . I was carried away . - No , spiritually . How you felt when you said you waited so long ? I felt better . Finally we talked about it without fear - That others will think I 'm crazy . - That 's what I mean acceptance . You should be proud of what you did . - I think it would be good glass of wine . You ? - Why not ? And why not ? You see , comes reward your efforts . They provide inspiration , you will remove the first line and accept that you did your job . - For acceptance . - For acceptance . Oh , God . There is an old saying among psychiatrists ... " As soon as you feel an attraction to the client , run the break earth . " It seems I should get my sneakers . I 'll always be here for you . I think I understand how you feel , Cade . You must have gone through hell . I thought you were dead , Harry . Why did they give Gua way ? I do not know , son , but that guy , Blaylock , told me that you fought against them . - I 'm proud of you . - Thank you . Remember that I put in the vault that pads your father ? Da . Here , take their baths . You deserve it . Cade Foster is a hero . Is not it wonderful ? Do you never thought you 'd see my picture on the front page . For bank robbery , perhaps , but not a good thing . - I think it 's time , Cade . - For what ? For the holiday you deserve . How about eight weeks in a tropical place ? In Hawaii and the Philippines can . You and your uncle , you can go fishing . Security will be discreet . Maybe I will call the president to tell you a few words . Why would accept ? - What Gua and fight ? - Mobilisation will take several weeks . - Do not worry . We are enough . - Eddie ? Once there , ask you about . Accept . What are you , Cade ? We do some deep sea fishing ? Sounds great . " Cade Foster , was hailed as a hero by the public yesterday stunned , around the world when the US government announced danger an alien attack directed towards Earth " . " Foster told reporters about his painful adventure of 18 months , which began with the death of his wife , Hannah . Officials hope Mr Foster , after recovery ... " - Where are they ? - Near Detroit . In a protected complex , the National Agency for Defense . You suffered a serious concussion . You have to stay in bed for at least three weeks . The public needs a hero . President asked to be you . You need to find Eddie Namboulous . I have already sent a team of agents to look . Or well hidden , or dead . Come on , son , I am your mother 's brother . Who gave you a book autographed by Bobby Hall ? - You think we 're aliens , right ? - Possibly . This is the darkest day in history . I thought I was crazy when I first made experiments . Cade , you 'll win . " We hope that Mr. Foster , after recovering from his incredible odyssey will accept the position of government adviser " . Cade ? Is something wrong ? No , everything is fine . Be right back . Let me out , you bastards ! Let me out ! Open the gate ! Open the gate ! Immediately ! Open the gate now ! An escape ! Open the gate ! Nothing about aliens . Joshua , you opened the door . The experimental protocol was to keep him on Cade Foster closed . We have created a whole complex and the hand that does not heal , only - In order to deceive the subject 117 . - And I failed . With this test we wanted to see the psychological archetype of Foster ... What would a comfortable life , safety , reward through a place among personalities . Foster 's archetype will not give up the fight . You committed treason . We should remember that the leader talk Council . We launched a public register for our strategy . There are six billion people on this planet . If each of the 117th , Foster has his attitude , we could lose this fight . Capturing and his dissection were vital to our mission . We showed what we said . I think Gua leaders will not agree with that . I am pleased to arrest you , Joshua . For high treason . Thank you , Eddie . You are in life , brother . I can not believe . With my two weeks in the hospital , the morgue ... Damn ! How come you have cheated ? Era ... perfect . Al naibii de perfect . You scared me , man . I thought you destroyed . - I feel guilty . - Why ? For a moment , for a split second , I wanted to accept the deal . I did not want to leave . I 'm not done , man . Blaylock said that the real hero is the one who never accepts end to demonstrate . The irony is that the words we have heard in a place Gua . The seduction of comfort and safety , can distract us from real plague on humanity fallen . We must resist the temptation and to continue the fight , because that 's the real hero , who gets up and fight , with determination to see a better future tomorrow . So open your eyes . Comes invasion . We need heroes ... Now , more than ever . Translation and adaptation thin Florin

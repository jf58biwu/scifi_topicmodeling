 You make man . No . Woman . Woman . THEME SONG : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine . Diagrams and charts . Mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold . Just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hands . Why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! ANNOUNCER : You 're on another time and place to a wondrous land where fantasy and reality intertwine , where the past and future spill into the present . And the present is a dark and endless highway . There 's the off ramp just ahead . You 've exited into , " The Sci-Fi Zone . " Check it out , Lis . 48 hours of our favorite TV show , " The Sci-Fi Zone . " Back to back and commercial free . You guys really get off on this show , don 't you ? It 's how we became friends . It is ? Yup . Third grade , second recess . I overheard Wyatt yanking about his favorite " Sci-Fi Zone " episode . " The Brain Sucking Space Ticks . " Turns out it was Gary 's favorite episode , too . I Introduced myself . We talked ticks for days . Been best friends ever since . And we never miss a zone-a-thon , right , buddy ? Right , buddy . [ LOCKER SLAMMING ] You are scum . Psycho loser . Hi , guys . Uh , oh . What happened ? We just got out of dodge ball . Gary deliberately threw the ball at me really hard . Oh , come on . I don 't believe that for a second . Thanks , Lis . We both know Gary throws like a girl . He used me , just cause he wanted to look studly in front of Kim Lucking . OK . I admit it . Kim was looking . I had the ball . I needed the perfect victim . WYATT DONNELLY : I never saw it coming . Did it hurt ? Look ! Why would you do something like that ? Hey , he owed me . You didn 't see what happened earlier in class . I was bending over to tie my shoes and Wyatt tells Kim to check out my VBC . LISA : VBC ? WYATT DONNELLY : Visible butt crack . Yeah , you laugh , but now Kim thinks I 'm some sort of flat bottom freak . This makes us even . Even is good . Even means that you two can be friends again . Wrong . It means we 're ex-friends . Fine by me , welt boy . Flat bottom . You 're not getting away from each other that easily . I was going to geometry . I was going to French class . What the- - We 've been genied . This time , you stay . If Lisa shows up , tell her she 's fired . Two boys in search of an exit . Not sure where they are , or why they 're here . Their distrust of each other will be only one of the many obstacles they will have to overcome here , in " The Sci-Fi Zone . " Don 't panic , but there 's a whole in space where the Coke machine used to be . Everything is black and white . I 'm talking major dog vision here . It 's the zone , Gary . Huh ? " The Sci-Fi Zone . " Are nut ball genie 's up to no good . ( TOGETHER ) Lisa ! [ RAYS FLASHING ] Gosh . What happened ? Everything 's in black and white . Talk about spooky . Talk about lame . Game 's over , Lis . We want out . I bet you do . Two boys in search of an exit . Wait ! What 's that strange noise ? [ GRUMBLING ] Look , we 're in a zoo ! A human zoo . They staring at us like we 're animals , only we 're human . Pretty ironic , huh ? Look , we don 't want to play , OK ? We just want to get away from each other . Period . I can 't believe you 're going to throw away years of friendship over a welt and a crack . Years of friendship ? If I had a nickel for every welt you gave me- - Yeah . Well , if I had a nickel for every time you tried to make me look like an idiot , I 'd put it in a socket and hit you with it . And that would leave a welt . Cha-ching for Wyatt . Look , " The Zone " made you friends once . I think " The Zone " can make you friends again . I think it 's time to pull the plug on your little psychology experiment . Fine . You want out ? Just walk through this door . That 's all I needed to hear . [ SCREAMING ] Together . You should have let me finish . [ GROANING ] My spine . Nice free fall . Bite me . Ready ? After you . Don 't you wish . [ SCREAMING ] Gary ? [ INTERPOSING VOICES ] Look . [ GROWLING ] [ OINKING ] Sorry . Oh , you poor thing . You 're hideous ! Well , she 's got a point . Looks like everyone 's here , but the mind reader from episode 23 . Check out the grade A babe-age . Oh ! All present and accounted for . You think we 're stuck here all day ? It would seem the answer is yes . Ah , the evil fortune telling machine from episode 106 . I got a question for you . Why is Gary such a phlegm wad ? Genetics . Your ex friend comes from a long line of heavy mucus producers . It doesn 't say that . Son of a gun . OK . It 's my turn . Why is Wyatt such a doily boy ? Your ex-friends acute , anal personality is the result of an unfortunate doily incident he suffered as a child . Wow . I never knew . Doily incident ? That 's ridiculous . I never had a doily incident . You know , I can 't believe I ever picked you as a friend . Oh , you didn 't . I picked you , remember ? And it was a pity pick , too . - You were the pity pick . - No , no , no . You were the pity pick . - You were the pity pick . - Pity pick . - Pity pick . Pity pick ! Pity pick ! Oh ! Oh ! Where are we ? Some kind of bomb shelter . But why ? [ BOMB DROPPING ] Who knows ? Every other " Zone " episode took place in a bomb shelter . What do we have here ? Magazines . Not just magazines . Playboy , Penthouse , Easy Rider . Strap on your reading glasses , Wy . We 've hit the soft porn mother load ! [ BOMB DROPPING ] No ! Oh , so close . I can 't believe you fell for that one . First time in the zone ? Never heard of irony . Shut up . VOICE : Help me ! Help me ! What ? Huh ? Hi , I 'm Talking Tammy and I 'm going to kill you . Talking Tammy . Episode 48 . I 'm going to kill you . And after you 're dead , I 'll do a rumba on your shallow graves . What are you doing ? You can 't do this ! I 'm Talking Tammy . I 'm going to kill you ! [ CRASHING ] Nice boot . Credit the hold . This Principal Scampi . Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly , please report to my office immediately . Sounds like trouble . Boned in the zone . [ INTERPOSING VOICES ] I like to think of Farber High as a very lovely lady . My lady , your lady , a big , fat , community lady offering life experiences that you two just aren 't taking advantage of . You want us to take advantage of a lady ? No . Of course not , silly boy . What I 'm trying to say is , I think you should sign up for some extracurricular activities . ( TOGETHER ) Oh . The cheerleading squad needs a few , good men for hoisting and catching duty , the occasional human sacrifice , that sort of thing . Human sacrifice ? Pyramid . I meant human pyramid . Ouch ! What was I thinking ? So you ready to sign up for the squad ? That looks like a contract . It does , doesn 't it ? It 's just a formality . Don 't bother trying to read the fine print , it 's in Latin . How about we just give you our word ? Oh , but a signature is so much more irreversible . And if we don 't sign up ? ( IN DEMONIC VOICE ) Let 's not go to that place . Hike me over a pen . I 'm your man . There you go , big guy . What kind of moron are you ? He 's the devil . Now I am the proud owner of one , human soul . Come with me , Wyatt Donnelly . You signed my name ? First time in " The Zone " ? Never heard of irony . Oh , this is so you . Well , two can play that game . I 'll see you in hell . - Whoa ! Whoa ! Slow down ! What do you know ? A two-for ! [ LIGHTNING STRIKING ] ( SINGING ) Beelzebub don 't play fair , he hates kids with poofy hair ! With a knick , knack , paddy whack , see you both in hell , the soul is a bonehead thing to sell ! Hello . Lisa ! You two having fun ? They won 't be having a hell of a lot of fun where they 're going . Get it ? Hell . They 're not going anywhere . Oh ? And who 's going to stop me ? You and the Bolshoi Ballet ? Hardly . [ HONKING ] This is what you bring forth to battle the Prince of Darkness ? No . That is . Oh , wow ! [ SCREAMING ] Did not see that coming . [ CHILD GIGGLING ] Turns out we 're all dolls in a child 's doll house . Look , if you 're going to be mad , be mad at me . I got you into this . Lisa 's right . Why should I be mad at Gary ? It 's not like he tried to sell my soul to Satan or anything . OK . Maybe " The Zone " thing wasn 't such a good idea . But the spell was only for a day and the day ends at midnight . Six , five , four , three , two- - MACHINE : One . Impact imminent . [ SCREAMING ] [ ALARM BLAZING ] Stupid suit ! Who makes a spacesuit without a gripper zipper ? Got to take a fuel leak , huh ? Should have thought of that before lift off . I 'm hot , OK ? Aren 't you hot ? No . I feel like a baked potato . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Wow . You look really goofy . Aren 't you guys hot in there ? What 's going on ? I thought this stupid wish was supposed to end . You said one day . I guess I sort of forgot something . In " The Zone , " time has no meaning . A day could last a lifetime . I 'm sorry I got you guys into this . I was trying to get you to be friends again . I 'm a regular chowder head . It 's OK , Lis . You meant well . Just get us out of here . I 'm a regular chowder head . Yeah , yeah . We know . I 'm a regular chowder head . Hm ? I 'm a regular chowder head . [ STATIC FLASHING ] She 's a hologram ! A what ? I 'm a regular chowder head . [ STATIC FLASHING ] It 's not Lisa . She 's not real . Oh , man . We 're dead ! No food , no water , and no Lisa ! I 'm a regular chowder head . What are you talking about ? We 're survivors . We just have to put our differences behind us , work together as friends again . Apart , we 're weak . But united , we 're unstoppable . I say we split up . I hear that . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] No ! You bastards ! You went and did it ! No ! No ! Heads up ! [ CRASHING ] What are you doing ? I was just trying to get it open . Be right down . Save me a Snickers . Sing to me , candy man . Oh , a Baby Ruthie ! Hi , I 'm Baby Ruthie . Go ahead , take a bite . But if you do , I promise you will choke on me . Eat me ! Eat me ! Oh ! This isn 't fair . Where are all the Snickers bars and the Corn Nuts ? It 's OK , Gar . We 'll find another vending machine . Where ? There 's nothing here , but wasteland . Wasteland ! Do you hear me ? Wasteland ! Oh ! Ow . What 'd you do that for ? Who needs a reasoning ? Where are you going ? To try and fix the ship . It may be our only way out of here . It 's fake . The whole ship is fake ! Gee , could this be- - boing ! - - another ironic twist ? This thing looks like we ordered it out of a comic book . But it seemed real enough when it brought us here . Unless- - Hm ? What if we 're imagining all of this . The ship , the suits , Lisa . For all we know , you and I are back home in my room right now and all of this is an illusion . If that 's the case , your mom 's going to be pissed . Why ? If you 're right , I just stepped out and took a whiz in your kitchen . The sun 's going down . We better get a fire started before we run out of light . Pepperoni pizza , snicker doodles , chili cheeseburgers , toast . All swimming in gravy . You tried to kill me back there with that vending machine . You 're paranoid . Am I , Gary ? If , in fact , you are Gary . Who else would I be ? For all I know , you could be one of those brain sucking , space ticks from episode 11 . You 're probably waiting for me to fall asleep , so you can stuck my brain out through my nose . Not much of a meal there . Think about it . Lisa wasn 't real , the ship wasn 't real . Who 's to say you are ? I know me when I see me . And I 'm me . So this is what it comes to . Stranded , starving , and mad at each other . Looks that way . When the fire dies out , it 'll be pitch black . You won 't be able to see me . I won 't be able to see you . Anything could happen . We should try and stay awake . Keep an eye on each other . Listen for any sound in the dark . Any hint of attack . Right . Try and last till morning . Then everything will be OK . Everything will be fine . Absolutely . After all , we 're friends first , right ? Best friends . CHETT DONNELLY : Two former friends now enemies . Sentries , if you will . Keeping watch on each other . Neither dares to move or blink . They hope only to last till morning , unaware that on this world , the night 's last as long as a year . And when morning finally comes , it sheds light not on their questions , but rather , on their bones . Former friends . Now victims . Blinded by their mutual suspicion . Unable to see the key to their salvation was always just within reach . I can 't believe it . Gary ! Wake up ! Ah ! Ow ! What 'd you do that for ? That hurt ! Did it ? Or is the pain merely an illusion . Maybe it never happened . Maybe it- - no , wait . You 're bleeding . It really is you ! What do you know , another welt ! You spooked me , you doof ! I finally figured out which episode this is . You did ? Remember the one where Gavin McCloud played the bougie stockbroker who steals a lot of money and travels to the future , only to die , penniless and alone , next to an ATM machine . And ATM stands for- - ( TOGETHER ) Automated Time Machine ! We 're saved ! We 're saved ! Sorry . For a second there , I forgot we hated each other . Yeah . Me , too . Hey , about that dodge burn . I- - It 's OK . I 'm sorry I flapped my lips about your butt crack . If I know my " Zone , " and I think I do , Gavin had his bank card in his boot the whole time . Here it is . [ BEEPING ] MACHINE : Please enter number travelling , destination , and arrival date . We 're going home , buddy ! Ow ! Watch the welt . Don 't start . We 're back . That ATM was amazing . I 'll say . Not only did it teleport us through time and space , gave me $ 40 in quick cash . You 're back . I guess that means you guys are friends again . Yeah . But we 're not talking to you . Someday you 'll thank me . [ RUMBLING ] Don 't look at me . Submitted for your approval , two troubled teens and one magic genie . Seemingly the perfect formula for mirth and mayhem . Little do they know that the joke is on them as they search for an exit in a world without doors . [ RUMBLING ] Oops . Did not see that coming . THEME MUSIC : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips . Shooting from the hip . Something different . We 're making weird science . Pictures from a magazine . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hands . Why don 't people understand my intentions ?

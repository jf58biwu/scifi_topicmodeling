 Okay , brace yourself , Lis . You may feel a slight tingling sensation . Hey ! Uh ... sorry . Gotta make sure you 're in tiptop shape . Consider this your 2000 zap checkup . Hard to believe it 's been two whole years since we created you , Lis . You 've filled out nicely for a toddler . Our little girl 's grown up , Gar . Hey ! Let 's celebrate . Let 's throw a little birthday soiree for our favorite genie . A party ? For me ? I never had a birthday party before . Birthdays are great ! Oh , remember your tenth , when your mom served the bad salmon ? Oh , and all the paramedics sang me " Happy Birthday ? - And we got helicopter rides ? - Ah , the memories . So ? Whaddya say ? You up for some cake and ice cream ? I guess . - Hello ? He said " ice cream ! " - I know . What 's the point of a party ? I don 't have anybody to invite . No family ... no one even knows I exist . Bummer . Hey , Gar ... I just thought of the perfect birthday present for Lisa . - A helicopter ride ? - I got a better idea . We 're gonna give Lisa a family ? Not a real family . Memories of a family . We make stuff up , plant it in her source code , and she 'll remember it like it really happened . Cool ! She 'll get the childhood she never had . Okay , what should we make her dad ? - Uh ... a patent attorney ? - Sucks ! Give her a cool dad . Let 's make him ... a secret agent . Like it , like it ... what about her mom ? Lisa always wanted to be a princess . - Let 's make her mom a queen ! - A barbarian queen ! - Tight-fitting body armor ? - You read my mind . [ Lisa ] You guys ready yet ? I 'm gonna zap in . - Not yet ! - I 'm gonna zap in now , ready or not ! - Hold on ! One more second ! - I 'm zapping in , I 'm zapping ... ! Okay ! You can come in now ! Where did you hide it ? Where 's my birthday present ? - Are you ready ? - I 'm ready ! I 'm ready ! Here it is ! So ? What do you think of all the decorations ? Dredge up any ... memories ? It reminds me of my sixteenth birthday , when my dad ... he 's a secret agent , you know ... bought me my first car . It was flamingo pink , and the headlights shot heat-seeking missiles ! I remember at my fourth birthday , our castle was attacked by the Uncanny X-Men . My mom , she 's a barbarian queen , you know , slew them mightily . Ooh , that 's from me . Try it on . Maybe later . Thanks , Gary . So ? Who 's ready for cake ? Oh , not yet ! We have to wait for my family , silly . They should be here any time now . She thinks her family 's coming . You know , Lis , sometimes families let you down on your birthdays . My family won 't let me down . They love me . Daddy ! Happy birthday , pumpkin ! One sec . I hope I 'm not too late for cake . - Hello , Daddy ! - Pumpkin ! Where 's Mom ? I call upon the power of the Almighty Zeus , and the denizens of Mount Olympus , - to wish you a happy birthday ! - Mommy ! I can 't believe you 're actually here ! That makes three of us . Hello , men . Fred Bullet , agent of S.P.A.N.K. - S.P.A.N.K. ? - S.P.A.N.K. Special Protectors of Allied Nuclear Kommandoes . Guys , this is my mom . Mom , the guys . Boys ! I 'm Li-Zar , barbarian queen of Romanus . Pain and pleasure ... oddly mixed . Come on ! You 're just in time for cake . What 's going on ? When we added the memories to Lisa 's programming , her magic must have made them real . Is it too late to give her a trampy sister ? Sorry we 're late , sweetie . Dr. Vengeance tried to blow up our car again . - Don 't start with me , Li-Z . - Dr. Vengeance , Mr. Cantankerous , the Giggler ... if it isn 't one ridiculous supervillain , it 's another . Those ridiculous supervillains pay the bills , thank you very much . Besides , we would have had plenty of time if you didn 't have to stop to pay homage to the bones of your ancestors . Do you want to anger the spirits , Fred ? Is that what you want ? Gary ... you wanna help me with the cake and ice cream ? - That 'll be your brother . - Chad 's coming ? Chad ? I don 't remember giving Lisa a brother . You were in the bathroom . Hey , who started the party without me ? Chad ! Gimme five ! Hey , boy , are you looking great . Hey , Pop ! Great to see ya . Ha-ha . - Martinis still your drink ? - Hey , is my butt hairy ? So Lisa 's brother is TV 's beloved simian , " Chad Chimp : Ape Detective ? " " Chad Chimp " was my favorite show as a kid . Oh , this is too weird . Everything we made up is coming to life . - Uh-oh . - What ? When you were in the bathroom , I made Hannibal Lecter Lisa 's favorite uncle . ... I was almost out of ammo . The bullets were all around me like a swarm of angry bees . Thinking fast , I fired myself out of the torpedo tube . I figured I was home free , until I ran into Natasha and her exploding banana . Daddy , I have a funny story too . Sh ! Honey , your brother 's talking . So anyways , after I seduced Natasha , I was able to slip out of Tangiers hidden in a shipment of Curious George dolls ! You do me proud , Chad . Daddy , I can use my magic powers to stop time ! Why don 't you use your magic powers to shut your big yapper ? I 'll zap your yapper , you stupid monkey ! Hey , hey , be nice to your brother . But Chad started it , and it 's my birthday ! It 's always gotta be about you , doesn 't it ? " Look at me , I 've got magic powers ! I have no body fat ! " Yeah ? Well , at least I didn 't start flinging - my own feces at Grandpa 's funeral . - I was destroyed ! I loved the man ! I loved him , I tell you , I loved him ! Loved him , loved him , loved him ! Okay , that should do it . We shouldn 't have anymore unexpected party guests . What about mom , dad , and monkey-boy ? Ah ... I can 't get to ' em . They 've already been assimilated into her source code . Cutting them out now would be like giving her a lobotomy . It 's beautiful ! Thank you , Daddy . Oh , look , look , look ... tells time in twelve different time zones , and , pull this ... strangling wire . Here , Lisa , my gift to you . It 's the severed head of my most bitter enemy , Medusa . Oh , Mom ! That is so sweet ! Severed head ? What the hell does she need that for ? Oh , and your gift was so much more practical , Fred . How often do you think she 's going to have to strangle someone ? Oh-ho-ho-ho , what do we have here ? Thank you , Chett ... Sweet smoking ' Elvises , sis , don 't you have any normal friends ? Oh ! Me Tarzan , you lusty . Knave ! I will smite you ! Don 't tease me . Please me . Let me kill him , Ma ! I got a clean shot ! - What the hell are you starin ' at ? - The monkey talks ? Why is everyone surprised when the monkey talks , huh ? - It 's just very unusual . - Yeah ? Well , get over it , homo erectus . This chimp talks , walks , and dances . Those line dance lessons really paid off . This is too freaky . Get behind me , Wyatt , I think I can take the chimp . Leave my brother alone ! - What 's with the hat ? - Neural neutralizer . As long as he wears it , he 's a party animal . I am not getting caught up in this madness . Li-Zar chooses you . Dance with me now . Okay . - Wanna cut a rug with your old man ? - You want to dance with me ? Of course ! You 're my special birthday girl . Thanks for coming , Daddy . This was the best birthday ever . I wouldn 't've missed it , pumpkin . Excellent . Couple of quick goodbyes , they 're out of here . - Where do you think they 'll go ? - Who knows ? Parallel dimension ? Pocket universe ? San Diego Zoo ? All I know is , we 're safe until Christmas . When next we meet , I shall be drenched in the blood of mine enemies . I love you , Mom . - Lisa , I 've finally found you ! - You ! I told you to stay away from my daughter ! Did you remember to block the " Ripsaw as Lisa 's boyfriend " file ? - Apparently not . - Oh , Ripsaw ! I never thought I 'd see you again ! Are those for me ? Along with my heart . Ever since you left , I 've been miserable ! I didn 't want to leave . Mom and Dad made me . They wouldn 't give their blessing . Forget about your parents , Lisa . It 's between you and me . - Marry me , Lisa ? - Oh , Ripsaw ! Of course I 'll marry you ! You guys aren 't dressed yet ? I 'm getting married in less than an hour . About the wedding ... we need to talk . No time . There . You look great . Let 's go . Lis , don 't you think this is a little sudden ? - I mean , you just met this guy . - Don 't be a dope ! It feels like I 've known Ripsaw forever . There 's something else that I need to tell you guys . I hope you won 't be upset , but after the wedding , - I 'm going to move back home . - What ? This party was so wonderful , it made me realize how much I miss my family , and I want to spend more time with them now . Plus , I want the kids to know their grandparents . Lis , there 's something you have to know . I mean , it 's not like we 're going to have kids right away , but when we do ... Lis , there 's no easy way to say this , so here goes . Fred , Li-Zar , Chad ... they 're not your real family . I know what this is about . You guys are feeling left out . Well , you shouldn 't . To me you 're family too . No , that 's not the problem , Lis . Your family isn 't real . They 're just memories we made up and planted in your program . That 's crazy ! Of course they 're real ! Why are you saying this ? Because we can 't let you marry some guy who 's a figment of our imaginations . Oh , so this is about Ripsaw . You sound like my father . Why is everyone trying to stop me from marrying the man that I love ? - Can 't you just be happy for me ? - You don 't understand . I think I do . And if you don 't like it , you don 't have to come . The wedding is at sundown in the castle courtyard . I hope you 'll be there . Castle ? What castle is she talking about ? Uh , that would be my fault . Lisa wanted to be a princess , so I programmed in that she grew up in a castle . So where is she ? Scotland ? Ireland ? Closer than that ... You made Lisa the princess of Putt-a-Lot ? It was the first castle that came to mind . Actually , it was the only castle that came to mind . Putt-a-Lot ! Putt-a-Lot ! Show your gal you 're hot to trot At Putt-a-Lot ! Sink your putt and strut your stuff At Putt-a-Lot ! And if there is anyone here who believes these two should not be joined in matrimony , let them speak now , or forever hold- - - Hello ! - Back here ! - Comin ' through ! - Excuse us ! Gary ! Wyatt ! I 'm so glad you decided to share my moment of joy . Actually , we 're here to ruin your moment of joy . You guys wanna stop her from marrying Fancy Boy ? - I 'm in ! - Daddy ! - Oh . Sorry . - Don 't worry , sweetheart . I 'll take care of these two interlopers . Finish them ! Honey , please ! I 'll handle this . I know you guys are upset , but you just have to accept this . I am going to marry Ripsaw , and you can 't stop me . Actually , they can . Ruling law states that if a wedding is challenged , the dispute must be settled by combat . - Winner gets the bride . - Combat ? Yes , combat ! And I 'll be happy to meet these two on the field of battle to win the hand of my beloved . Try not to hurt them too badly , Ripsaw . They are my friends . I 'll give you a lesson in the royal sport you 'll not soon forget ! The royal sport ? Putting ! Are you sure you can take this guy ? It 's in the bag . You 're looking at the three-time Summer League Putt-a-Lot champion , Junior Division . Let 's get this over with , huh ? The royal wedding bed grows cold . Oh , Ripsaw ! Stand back , Bluto . What the hell was that ? I thought this was a putting contest ! Oh , it is . Centurion putting ! - Come on , Gar . - I 'll need a caddy and a paramedic . And the winner is Ripsaw ! Yeah ! I shouldn 't have spotted him those five strokes . Gary , Wyatt , I want you to know you 're welcome in the castle anytime . We 'll always be friends . Lisa , we want you to be happy . And if that means someday you get married and you leave us , that 's okay . But you have to accept the truth about your family . - Don 't start this again . - Doesn 't it just seem a little weird ? You were raised in a miniature golf course ? Your brother 's a chimp ? - Well ... maybe he 's adopted . - Hey , if anybody 's adopted , it 's you . And look at your mom . She 's younger than you are . Explain that away . She ... doesn 't cook her meat ? Lisa , Gary and I put these memories into your programming . Your family , Ripsaw , all of it . You never had a talking pony ... you never were the Gerber baby ... and you never turned letters on " Wheel of Fortune . " - But ... I remember all of it ! - And we remember making it up . Why would you do this to me ? We didn 't want you to be alone in the world . We wanted you to have a family for your birthday . - We screwed up , Lis . - Lisa ? I 'm sorry , but we 're going to have to postpone the wedding . It 's just a little too fast for me . But we 've known each other since we were children ! Ripsaw , I 'm only two ! Trust me , there 's plenty of time ahead . As you wish , my darling . I 'll always wait for you . Thanks . Lisa , we are so sorry about this . I promise , when we get home , I will figure out some way to wipe out all of these fake memories . Touch them and I 'll turn you into a stump ! You made my family on your computer , just the way you made me , right ? - Sort of . - Then they 're as real as I am . - In a way . - Then that 's good enough for me . No one gets to choose their family anyway . You have to love them for who they are . Even if they are the products of two very twisted imaginations . - Happy birthday , then . - Thank you . This was my best birthday ever ... if you don 't count all the cool made-up ones . Sorry about the wedding , sis . Whaddya say we take your mind off your troubles with a rousing nine holes ? - I 'll kick your monkey butt . - Ha-ha ! I 'd like to see ya try . Come on , Li-Z ! You and me against the kids . - We will slay them . - Mightily , my dear . Mightily . Heh-heh , isn 't this great ? They 're hippos and they 're hungry ! Look at ' em eat ! - Hey , Lis , you got a letter . - Really ? It 's from Dad . He 's inviting us all to Thanksgiving dinner . " We hope the boys will be able to join us . " Cool ! " This letter will self-destruct in five seconds . " Oh , Daddy ... Captioned by Grant Brown

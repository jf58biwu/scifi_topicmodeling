 It shouldn 't be here . Moving on to FcIass star at right ascension 7.36.7 . 5.21 declination . I thought that was the Iast one . Why 'd you think that ? You said that it wouId be . I distinctly remember forgetting that . I don 't know why I put up with this . I do . Because I let you drive . I 'm a rideshare hostage . FcIass star . Recent variability . 14.6 Iightyears away . This is nuts anyway . The whole approach . SETI 's tough enough on microwave band . Now you want to search FM ? With all that noise ? Might as well look for a needle in a haystack of needles . Station Five . Zane ? calvin 's holding me up . 1 : 30 . Tuesday ? Wednesday ? A.M. ? P.M. ? What can I say ? I 'm a rideshare hostage . I 'm going to go pee . I will try to Where are you ? I 'm having a drink with Becky . while I 'm here working ? There 's a cute hockey player here too . But he 's only in town for one night . AII right . I give up . What do you want ? Zane . Okay . I 'II leave now if you leave now . But do not talk to any strangers on the way out . okay ? Swear you 'II be there ? I don 't want a repeat of last week . I will . End of story . There is nothing more important to me right now than our There is nothing more important to me right now than our Good solid spike . Nice symmetry to the modulation . Detection protocol . Now ! Confirmation Phase One . Swing dish five degrees off axis . And signal fades . Looking good . Now swing dish back on target . you are howling . Phase Two ! Initiating software check . Jumping ahead to Phase Three : second source verification . Who 's still on Iine ? Green Bank ? Ohio State ? Moffet field ! Checking . still checking . Be there . Just be there . We got to get another ear on this . Software seIfchecks . Phase Two complete . Moffet . You 're killing me . I 'm dying here ! Just pick up the phone so we can confirm this . Nothing . Zaminsky ! Zaminsky ! This is not valet parking ! stalled out on me . stalled on me ! This piece of sir . Sorry . That 's it ? Fortytwo seconds . We listened all night . and the sound never repeated . nonEarthbased signal ! Gordy . like a military burst communication . No way . No way . Not at 107 megahertz . 107 ? What the hell are you doing so far below the microwave ? Good question . this wolf 336 ? 14.6 Iightyears away . AII right . Okay . it expands and contracts dramatically . maybe you can explain to me how intelligent life can actually develop in such a volatile environment . It 's only been unstable for what ? Fifty years or so . Which means it 's possible some form of Iife could still exist there . exactly . Maybe this is a distress call . An S.O.S. Maybe they 're sending out their encyclopedia GaIIactica jettisoning all their knowledge before it goes down with the ship . and it never repeated . in case it does . I 'II pull double shifts . I 'II pull triple shifts if I have to . But I want priority status and dish time . Serious dish time . preferably . okay ? Go ahead . It 's a mandatory 20 % cutback . Tracking station has a fixed operating cost . I can 't touch that . I 've got to look at personnel . Are you even shitting me ? instead of two weeks . but Let me see if I got this straight . I come to you I come to you with what may be the preeminent discovery of the 20th Century : the possibility of extra solar life . And I get shitcanned for it ? I know how important this is . But searching for E.T.s in this political environment is a tough sell on capitol hill . we 're going to lose it . Let 's forget about me for a second . What about the signal ? I 'm skeptical . But it is interesting . I 'II pass it along to decoding . but I don 't have to tell you . You know the rule . If you can 't confirm it Then it doesn 't exist . What asshole made up that rule ? Can we fire him instead ? It doesn 't please me to be losing the brightest and the best . I wish there was another way . I honestly do . it is finally cooling off in the southland after a day of near record temperatures . But hot again tomorrow and hot again on Thursday with no letup I couId No . There 's a SETI program up north . was begging me to come up . Might call him . are you ? We had a bell ringer this morning . really good signal . I just couldn 't confirm it in time . You had something really good last year too . Turned out to be what ? A broken microwave oven . What 's your point ? There 's always something to give me false hope ? That I 'm wasting my Iife ? I didn 't say that . it 's interesting that you did . Come on . Someone is watching . What ? How in the hell did I wind up with somebody like you ? I got tired of rich guys with good futures . No . really . What is it you see in me ? What made you call me the first time ? when their self worth goes I see a man of great intelligence cute little kind of insecurity . A little paranoia This went to shit fast . Why do we always have to analyze everything ? Can 't you trust I Iove you ? algorithms I trust . boolean logic I trust . they just mystify me . Two years and we 're still talking about trust ? It 's amazing . huh ? it 's your career . I will support any decision you make . But if we are going to make it we 've got to take care of our problems here on planet Earth . That is just a little hard when you 're always off looking at the stars . Listening . Listening . Char ? Zane . Are we ? How 'd you do on the test ? How 'd you do on the test ? I 'm saying it 's incomplete . There 's no chemical breakdown . There 's no broadband chart analysis . Want me to go on ? That information isn 't available at this time . This information was promised me two months ago . These are not national secrets . This is a routine analysis of the atmosphere . Why should I There 's a problem with that satellite . It 's blind to certain trace gases . really ? As of when ? It lost a solar panel . Some functions were shut down to save energy . here 's my problem . I 've devoted my sabbatical to greenhouse trace gases . I might as well be counting cow farts in Montana . You 'II have to wait until the new satellite is in place . When 's the launch date ? NASA doesn 't have that information . Round and round we go . Thanks for naught . Moffet field . man ? Zane . Hi . but I felt obligated to let you know about a job offer that came up . telecommunications . Looks pretty sweet too . you know . Zane . I don 't think things are going to work out here . But I thought you were looking for radio astronomers ? Some good creative thinkers ? Isn 't that what you said ? Creative 's one thing . Too creative 's another . I 'm not tracking . I 'm not sure I should be saying this . I talked to phil Gordian at J.P.L. The indication was Just say it . He said you were faking signals in order to keep your job . I do believe this permit 's expired . Why haven 't you ? To raise the temperature of the planet tenfold To raise the temperature of the planet tenfold to change the atmosphere into one suitable to colonization to construct farms and cities and build an infrastructure capable of supporting thousands of colonists . Make no mistake . Never before have we undertaken a task Have we undertaken a task of this size . The terraforming of Mars . Do you know who phil Gordian is ? The key to all of this is polar ice . Enough heat generating factories could be built . The heat would be enough to melt Excuse me . But perhaps you 'd care to use the microphone ? I would . Thanks . phil Gordian ? Has anybody seen him ? I 'm looking for phil Gordian . Anybody seen phil Gordian ? Zane . Why don 't we step outside ? Let him finish . Did you even give it to decoding ? Did you even see what was there ? Why don 't we take this outside ? I want my tape back . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what you 're referring to . Why don 't you show me how smart you are by leaving right now ? huh ? What are you doing this for ? Back it up . Let 's go . Why are you telling them lies about me ? now ! Let 's go ! Why ? Come on . Let 's go . Why ? I 'm sorry . He 's a troubled young man . A very troubled young man . My apologies . please . Continue . Where was I ? polar ice . After the polar ice has been melted the atmosphere begins to grow thicker . a kind of critical mass is reached . the atmosphere begins to work for us . Station Five . tell me I 'm not losing my mind . where are you ? They 're acting like it never happened . I saw Gordian . It 's like we never gave him any tape . Zane But then I remembered . It should be on the backup DAT system . We should have a copy of the signal . yes and no . There are some D.O.D. guys here going through our stuff as we speak . it was a burst from a spy satellite . What ? It 's a defense thing . Which is probably why Gordian couldn 't tell us about it . We weren 't cleared for this spy shit . listen to me very carefully . satellites do not move like stars move . okay ? but I do know they 're lying to you . Is this everything ? don 't ! We have it all ? cal ! Don 't you dare ! There There 's a backup system . Hey . why was it moving like a star ? Not really sure . We 'II have to get back to you on that . It 's a very aggressive company . With the federal mandate for air bags It 's a very aggressive company . With the federal mandate for air bags they are perfectly positioned to dominate the market for years . blade Co . technologies . AII right . I 'II send you a prospectus . Are you at the same address ? ten minutes ? So I get this signal . How about 5 : 00 ? signal from an F class . 5 : 15 . Like our sun but hotter . First they act like it 's nothing . Great . Thanks . Now they 're going to unimaginable pains to make it disappear . I thought you had a new job . Char . Why the hell would they do that ? What is it they 're trying to hide ? Maybe we could talk later . I need to talk about this now ! I called last night twice . I got the messages . I thought the problem was I wasn 't around enough . tales From The Dark Side ? I have been avoiding this . Yes . Okay . Define " this . " The brokerage is strongly suggesting I head up the office in San Diego soon . It 'd mean moving there . Can you tell them no ? Thank you . I tell you I 'II support any career decision you make . But when it comes to my work You 're considering this ? it 's Mr. Morgan on Iine five . And ? I got to take this . By any chance is he going to San Diego also ? Why don 't you stick your paranoia back in your pants and get out of here ? I will call you . Fine . No problem . When ? Whenever I get to it . " Tuesday ? Wednesday ? A.M. ? P.M. ? " Go ! Right now . They could be talking to us right now . An array . Phased array . Mr. Carbiner . I 'm Horace with your local satellite company . Good morning . Can I see your dish ? What a glorious morning . Hot enough for you ? we 're offering a free upgrade on a totally automated fiber optic control system . AII this at no extra cost to you . No extra cost to you . One of the many ways we 're improving the quality of service to our customers . Can I see your dish ? Jesus ! What are you doing here ? And how soon can you leave ? What are you doing here ? I Iive here . Do you mind ? I mind you grabbing on me . Let go ! I 'm trying to help you down . I can do it myself ! My butt is stuck . You live next door . With Mrs. RooseveIt . That it ? I Iive in L.A. Just kicking it here a minute . I don 't want anybody nosing around here . it wouId be over and done . What do you know about my stuff ? What are you doing climbing roofs at 1 : 00 in the morning ? ShouIdn 't you be out tagging freeway signs ? I don 't got to tell you shit . Fine . Hang there all night . Hey ! Where you going ? Get me down . What are you doing ? I told you to wait downstairs . What 's this ? It 's a cooling jacket for a Iow noise amp . Don 't touch it . What 's that bIinky shit over there ? will you just sit down ? Put this on your ankle . I don 't want that thing . It 's cold . Just keep your butt down your foot up and your mouth shut . but don 't touch anything . What are them dots ? They 're satellite dishes . Each one . it makes one big radio antennae . What 's it do ? It lets you get close to the stars . K BUMP . Greetings from beyond the solar system . is Voyager 2 . What 's that ? Voyager is a planetary probe launched in the mid ' 70s . They don 't teach science in school anymore ? Too busy patting us down to see if we 're strapped . I assume you mean guns . They find one on you ? Not me . Just everyone else . That 's how come the folks want me out of L.A. Crazy stuff going on . Can I come in now ? wolf 336 . We check the spectra at different magnifications looking for anything unusual . all we find is the typical radio noise of an F class star . huh ? The aliens ? This channel ? this frequency . But we can 't really talk . It takes years for a radio wave to get here . So all we can really do is just listen . But what 'd they say ? Before . Maybe how to live forever . Maybe how to make nuclear power safe . I don 't know . Maybe they were just ordering out for a pizza . We won 't really know what they 're saying . Not at first . But that doesn 't make it less important . if we can find it again finally know that we 're not alone . I wonder what they 're going to look like . Warning : Your sleep period is over . Get out of bed . Jesus ! You going to try again ? Tonight ? I couId wait up and help some this time . did you ? What am I ? New ? What about your grandma ? She doesn 't care if you stay up late ? Not after 10 : 00 . What happens at 10 : 00 ? She passes out on cough syrup . you can come over . only if you got the proper I.D. Where I get that ? huh ? When can I do something ? Okay . Hit that key . What one ? That one . This one here ? Yes . Are you sure it 's okay ? I 'm sure it 's okay . This one right under my finger ? Give me your badge . You 're fired . I 'II do it . I 'II do it . What 's this signal going to look like ? It 's just a spike . A big one or a little one ? Because I got a big one . That 's it . That 's exactly what calvin and I saw . Come back ! okay ? same periodicity . What the hell ? What is that Iambada shit ? It 's got to be a bounce . comes back in through the system . It 's coming from Earth ? Some Mexican radio station on the same frequency tells us but it doesn 't But it 's wack . AII of it ? Wait a second . The first signal was definitely sky based . We verified it . But this one is Earth based . Two identical signals . the other from Earth . I 'm all screwed up here . It doesn 't make any sense . unless they 're talking . Last night you were telling me we couldn 't talk because it 'd take years cal . I got to talk to cal . I don 't know . Somebody said something about a faulty heater . Carbon monoxide . really ? but this guy 's D.O.A. What have we got here ? brazil . Look . You can see for yourself . 700 % increase over the Iast five years ? How can that be ? My very question . IIana ? It 's hard to say . We cobbled it together from ground stations uncle earl 's aching corns . Some of your numbers are there . No satellite data ? NASA 's bird has a bum wing . You 've obviously got some ratty data . We checked this as best we could . will you ? assuming the same increase . Of course . This had better be wrong . we 're looking at an increase of 12 degrees Centigrade and that 's just Catastrophic . I was going to say impossible . that too . central Mexico . my friend ? I take you to some much very good places . Let 's just head for town . When does it start to cool off down here ? In San MarsoI ? This is cool off . This dial right ? left . Both ways . This radio station ? You know where this is ? Very far . Not close to town . Let 's go there . How about the ruins ? You want to see the ruins ? The radio station . I need to go there . I 'm going to talk to the people . he say . But no persons was here When the fire come last night . I 'm too late . One day too late . Posada San MarsoI . One of our much very best hotels . You see those ? These TV dishes . You know of any big ones ? Big ? but big . sixty feet wide . Big . " One of our very much best hotels . " This is Peter DowIing from Sierra satellite . Just wondering if you were sick or dead or something . pal . this is Doug . I heard about you and Char . I heard it was skidsviIIe . I 'm sorry to hear that . I know what it feels like . let 's do it . okay ? And would you mind if I got her number ? I want to talk to her about some investment possibilities . AII right ? Thanks . I called this morning . Just didn 't leave a message . Are you there ? I guess I didn 't get back to you that night Zane . I get so tired of being questioned about even the basic things . I was feeling guilt too for steering you away from what you should be doing from what you love the most . But you were such an ass the Iast time we talked . Damn . I can 't remember if this machine lets you ramble so I better just admit this quick . I miss your weird paranoid brain . call when you can . Zane ? Move ! huh ? Because I saw you in town . I saw you at the airport . You were waiting for me . didn 't you ? How the Where do you hide a 20 meter dish ? Research . Jesus ! Hey ! Excuse me . Excuse me . What 's going on here ? I don 't know . These guys are stealing my stuff . They 're taking my equipment . I was trying to work here . Excuse me . What ? Take it easy . will you guys take it easy ? I know I should say thanks . But that was a pretty dicey stunt you pulled back there . You could have got us both shot . and you 're right . didn 't I ? Zane Zaminsky . Am I still bleeding ? A little . IIana Green . Damn ! It 's hot in here . Think they 'd have air conditioning in this place . I don 't like blood . Why were they rousting you ? Something about my gear they don 't like . What is all that stuff ? It 's technical . It looks like some kind of radiosonde for atmospheric sampling . That 's right . That 's absolutely right . Just who are you ? Can I ask what I 've done wrong ? I wish to apologize to you both . We have overreacted in this matter . it seems to be ruined . If you give me a local number Wait . Why was I detained ? Why did these men take my gear ? You were on private land . Isn 't this a public facility ? please try to understand . This is a new type of power station . With new technology come those who would Iike to steal it . yes ? right ? very few emissions . What kind of emissions ? I 'm not an expert in this matter . Perhaps if you were to leave me a local number Perhaps if you give me call it a push . Come on . They say there 's a twin for everyone in the world . That 's not it . they 're gonna land on top of each other . IIana . That is not it . Nice of them to bring our cars here . all right ? I understand you do residential work . I 've got a little weeding problem I 'm hoping you can help me with . It 's really a very small job . Here 's the address . We saw gulf hurricanes in March . killing thousands . right ? Yes and no . Yes in that we show an increase in global temperature over the Iast decade . but if you factor out the cooling effects of volcanoes It 's happening . Our factories can 't pump out 7 billion tons of CO2 a year and not do damage . This is the Arctic ? Ninety miles from the pole . What 's it doing there ? it 's just another anomaly . But as a whole The Arctic is very sensitive to environmental change . That 's why we go there . Things happen first in the Arctic . It 's like a window on the future . So you 're talking about something a Iot bigger than global warming . I see some major climatic ordeal happening . God . I get so damned apocalyptic when I drink . every major turning point on this planet began with a shift in climate . Even a ten degree increase will melt 70 % of the polar icecap wipe out all agriculture . Raise the temperature of the planet to change its atmosphere into one suitable to colonization . Terraforming . What is that ? he 's been giving talks about Mars and how its whole environment could be changed and how we can terraform it and then live there . of course . It 'd cost hundreds of billions . But he did say something about After the polar ice has been melted the atmosphere again grows thicker . a kind of critical mass is reached . What ? I don 't know . We might give him a call if it 's not too I did the time warp dance here . Before I go around saying the sky is faIIing or even warming I 've got to get new gear from N CAR . When do you leave ? First thing in the morning . You ? I don 't know yet . I still haven 't seen everything I need to see . Maybe a couple of days . I really enjoyed our talk tonight . It 's uncommon to find someone who can grasp the things I 'm passionate about . I hear you . Where you staying ? I was in room 302 at the big pink place until it merged with room 402 . Some kind of an accident ? Everything is lately . How is this dump ? It 's not bad with the lights off . look . I 'm gone early in the morning . Why don 't you stay here now and keep the room tomorrow ? share it ? There is a couch . We could at Ieast keep the appearance of respectability . I suppose we could . Not that I don 't find the proposition intriguing . Not that you just propositioned me . Did you ? that 's a Iot of guilt for someone who hasn 't done anything yet . I take it there 's a warm body in bed at home . still in my head . I don 't know . I guess there 's still something to be said for abstinence . You think ? In moderation . in care of UCLA . I will . What ? Yes ? Just be careful . Change for the phone ? it was good to hear your voice . but I tried to no . You 're right . I was a complete asshole . but you still get downloads at home ? but PIanecorp Industries . will ya ? Zane ? I 'm not exactly Who said I was gone ? I stopped by yesterday . The papers were stacking up so I put them inside . PIanecorp Industries . blah . overhaul and put them back on Iine . three facilities in Mexico . Wait a minute . Back up . There 's more than one plant ? they have eight facilities on Iine all in third world countries . Twenty plants ? Where 's all the money coming from ? American investors . Your mutual funds at work . Wow . Char . Wh What ? That 's it ? you call me up for a stock report ? I I don 't know what else to say . How about " I miss you " ? I shouldn 't have to say it . If that 's it how big does that make the my God . I 'm sorry . my friend ? we caught you speeding on the wrong side of the road . we caught you speeding on the wrong side of the road . Then you said you were in the cantina last night with Senorita what 's her name ? Green . IIana Green . I suppose you were drinking . We had a couple of beers . That has nothing to do the Day of the Dead . So what ? you 're not familiar with these costumes with all these things we see all around . Wrong . What I saw was no costume was no paper mache skeleton . It was nothing like that . The captain of security for the power station has called to report an accident . intoxicated killed someone with his car last night . An American man . that is not what happened . That is to say you were involved . They are lying ! It 's up to me to decide who 's lying . and you give me answers . were you involved in this ? I hit something with the car . I 'm not sure . I want to see it . Bring the body . I demand to see it ! Mr. Zaminsky . That 's exactly what they 're doing . Don 't go anywhere . Our word for an attorney is abogado . I suggest you Mercury peaks around 99 degrees today . that will be a record for this day in October . But nowhere is it hotter right now than in the hallways of NASA where officials are still trying to explain what happened yesterday to that atmospheric satellite that blew up just 32 seconds after launch . Press conference now underway at J.P.L. in Pasadena . Anybody gonna lose their job over this ? I 'm really not the right p You don 't look too good . I Iook like a can of smashed assholes . Here 's a tip . If you ever get the chance to travel with a Mexican rodeo pass . I 'm sorry . D.O.D. was putting pressure on me to keep a lid on things . Then you start asking questions in front of all those people . no . Forget it . No hard feelings . I just wanted to drop by and pay you a visit check up on my old buddy Gordy maybe see what 's really what who 's really who . you 're really not making very much sense . We should walk over to the infirmary . It didn 't make a Iot of sense to me either the first time I saw your face on another guy . I don 't think so . I think somebody just screwed up . don 't you ? Gordy . What do you want ? What do I want ? I wanna blow a hole in your head and donate your organs to science . But there are a few things I need to know first . Fuckin ' N.R.A. It 's just so easy to get one . Let 's have a chat . Yeah . Okay . Media Center . Looks like somebody stole some camera gear . You want it ? A real crime . Somebody 's on the way . So who was targeted ? Anyone in SETI ? not anyone . Who then ? Look in the mirror . Prime intellect . Nonconformist reasoning . Capacity for lateral thinking . Isn 't that what you see ? And then what ? A control is assigned ? Somebody like you ? Zane ? it 'II be the Iast thing you ever see . I think it 's possible to say that you 've been watched for quite a while now . So which programs besides SETI ? NASA ? Ask yourself why an antenna won 't deploy on a deep space probe . Or ask how they could launch a $ 6 billion telescope without testing its mirror . What you 're actually saying I 'm saying nothing . I 'm just listening to you ask questions . Then I 'II ask about PIanecorp . PIanecorp . I don 't know what that is . it 's that factory down in Mexico . It 's outside my knowledge . One of 20 being built in third world countries . Outside . Where no laws protect the air . Outside my knowledge . You build where it 's hot . don 't you ? if you force me to answer you what you will be hearing is your own death sentence . you don 't know the half of it . you 're just one little guy with a big conspiracy theory and the world is full of them . you take great care in what else you choose to Iearn . They 're terraform factories ? Yes . You 're pumping out greenhouse gas . Now you 're dead . You 're changing the air the whole ecosystem . We 're just finishing what you started . What would 've taken you 100 years we 'II do in 10 . Just speeding along your own demise . right ? If you can 't tend to your own planet none of you deserve to live here . Bang . You 're dead . Don 't tell me that 's who I think it is . We have a problem here ? No . No problem . I 'm gonna handle this myself . Geez ! what are you doing out here ? You scared the living Who 's been here ? Anyone ? Anybody been watching my house ? Nobody I seen . I can 't believe they wouldn 't be . I 'm gonna say something that 's gonna sound completely insane . I 'm telling you because I think you might actually believe me . I 'm also telling you because I can 't be the only one who knows in case they find me before I finish this . tell me . I followed the signal to Mexico because we thought somebody was yeah . " Kiki . So what was they ? Do they got these little flashlight fingers that Maybe they got these big metal teeth that come out and sort of What does they look like then ? Like you . Like me . Like anyone . What they doing here ? I 'II show you . as soon as I fire up the array . Shit ! You 've been evicted . out to the big dish . hold this . Don 't drop it . What game does it play ? Where 's the start button ? You going to let me in ? Who 's Char ? they will be soon . Who ? The police ? What about the police ? some detective . He said something about manslaughter charges in Mexico . that 's phat . The whole thing was fabricated . They set me up . I don 't understand . Why would the police want to Not the police . It was them . Them . Who 's them ? Forget it . probably the aliens . Who is this child ? And I hope he means illegal aliens . I 'II take your car . Give me that . you won 't . Not until I know what is going on here . but I know what I saw . I know why they 're here . I know about the poppy field in the Arctic . Their whole master plan about the air and the Give me the keys . not Iike this . You don 't have to come . I wouldn 't believe it unless I 'd seen it myself . I must leave now . you are nuts . Can I come ? Get off me ! This isn 't a field trip . I Ieft my grandma a note . I want to help . Drive ! pull over at the on ramp . I 'II drive . I 've got shotgun . I think that you 've got to deal with this somehow . If it means both of us going to the police and explain I can 't get stuck in some jail . Not now . pull over . what do you hope to accomplish ? Keys . Keys . Where 's Char ? What are you doing ? Getting my stuff out of the car . That all right ? I just The strangest thoughts . " you push it . this stuff here . Light it up everything . Find OMNI Star 5 . I 'II need two sets of coordinates . Right ascension and declination . I don 't see how listening to some star not listening . So this is some kind of satellite in orbit ? It 's a co op weather satellite one that about 50 TV stations pull a continuous feed off of . A hundred thousand watts ought to get their attention . They 'II understand what this means ? We 're gonna find out right now . Shit . What 's happening ? What is wrong with this thing ? Gardening . I didn 't see any gardens around here . Char ? Like I should know . You made a call from the car . When you start talking about aliens and master plans and this woman being killed in Mexico Did I mention that it was a woman ? okay ? Char ? it is . You were scaring me with your talk . You 're scaring me now . you left . waiting for me . Zane . Like I needed all that career advice ? The gentle persuasion the little nudges about how I was wasting my Iife ! cold . Too cold . I 'm sorry . I am just so sorry . I didn 't believe about You 've got to trust me when I say that I only called the police and only because I wanted Then what are they doing here ? Who told them to find me here ? I don 't know . I honestly do not know . Watch this screen . hit the red key right there next to you . The transmit key . You ain 't leaving me here ? Don 't worry . They 'II be chasing us . We 're going to give this one more shot . Go . it 's this way . Go . Give me the chain . You can move the dish from here . Go . I can do this . please just trust me . Kiki . Kiki ! Hit it now ! the red transmit key . Hit it now ! hit it now ! Now ! Now ! Hit it now ! Like I said . You didn 't know the half of it . what happened ? Why did they leave ? They didn 't . How do you know ? Because we aren 't dead yet . help me . Move ! can we get out of here now ? Not that way . I 'II be right behind you . Not so fast . please . please . Why did it have to be like this ? Why couldn 't you just come and ask for our help ? Then you tell them You go back and tell them that she knows that others will know ! It 's not going to be easy . Not anymore . Summer is just refusing to go away . Record highs again in the Big apple while New england states report a delay of the fall foliage season . It 's been warmer than normal up and down the Eastern seaboard . They 're terraform factories ? Yes . You 're pumping out greenhouse gas . Now you 're dead . You 're changing the air the whole ecosystem . We 're just finishing what you started . What would 've taken you 100 years we 'II do in 10 . Just speeding along your own demise . right ? If you can 't tend to your own planet none of you deserve to live here .

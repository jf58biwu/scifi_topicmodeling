 Here in 2007 , 18 years after the fall of Communism ... the promise of Eastern Europe is a faded dream . Constant violence and civil strife have torn the countries apart ... plunging them into a hellish existence . The very fabric of civilised society has come apart ... as government mismanagement , pollution , and widespread crime ... have caused a total economic and moral collapse . ADRENALIN : Fear The Rush The failure of governments has caused ethnic conflicts to erupt . These internal struggles continue to destroy what little there is ... of their nations ' infrastructure . Entire towns have been blown off the face of the earth . The conflicts have escalated to the point ... where now thousands die in the fighting each week . Cold , ruthless evil seems to have invaded every soul ... as each side is intent on annihilating the other . Anarchy is destroying what little is left . No electricity , no power . Each city has been turned into a world of ruins and decay . With such a total breakdown of government control ... food shortages have appeared everywhere . Starvatlon and disease grow rampant . Mass panic has caused riots to rage out of control . Neighbour has turned against neighbour as they struggle to survive . It was a death sentence for these inmates ... who were later locked away in cpecial government contamination centres ... after their efforts failed . Many escaped , insane and violent , into society ... causing an unprecedented wave of mass killings . No one saw it coming . We were all looking out for big things : a nuclear accident , another Chernobyl . As the Russian republics split apart , no one knew who was responsible for what . While they were trying to figure it out , something leaked , something small . It rolled through Eastern Europe , moving west like a giant wave of death . They called it virulent microphage . Stay focused . Any sign of the inmate ? No , nothing . - Anyone see anything outside ? - It 's clear out here . One of the patients is pointing . Something is up ahead . I can see the inmate area . I see one of our guys down . - Did you get that ? - Cut out for a second . I said , I see one of our guys down . He 's dead . There is no sign of the killer . An officer got slashed . The killer is armed with a knife . - You guys see anything yet ? - Nothing . I 'm going into the inmate ward . Shit ! We got a lot of bodies here . They 're everywhere . All slashed , all stabbed . The son of a bitch cut everyone up . Doctors , nurses , patients ... Looks like he got out of his cuffs . The doctor must have freed the bastard to treat him . I think we got something here . What do you have ? - By the stairs ! - By the stairs ! We see him . Ground unit in pursuit . - Run ! - We 're on our way . Boston 2007 A.D. When the United States saw the potential for the disease on its home shores ... it put the recent immigrants into quarantine camps . My husband , Martin , was one of those immigrants . So we interned with the rest of the masses . It was only supposed to be for a few months ... but by the time Martin was killed , our baby was a young boy ... and the camp had become a city . Give us back our rights ! Stop them ! Get back ! Out of the way ! Shoot on sight . You understand ? Trust yourselves . There were two worlds : the sick and the healthy . No one wants in , and no one gets out . Hey , man . Take it down the alley , would you ? Don 't you got no fucking manners ? Hey , man ! You better check it out . Shit . Help ! - How much time is there ? - A little over six hours . Then what ? Our subject becomes a blood bomb , and everything he touches turns to shit . And if that virus goes hot ... everyone he touches will piss blood and shit out their guts . So what do you say we just do our job ? - Sir , we 've got a location . E sector . - Let 's move . No one gets in , and no one gets out . Unless you have a passport . And they 're almost impossible to get . There are only two ways to get them . One way is to go into a government service ... try to stay clean and healthy and earn your way out . The other is the black market . But unlawful possession is punishable by death . Mummy , I don 't feel good . - I know , honey . - My bones hurt , Mummy . I know , but Mummy 's got a special surprise for you . It 's going to take you to a special place and make you feel strong . Will Daddy be there ? No , honey . Are you going to come with me ? No . It 's special , just for you . Come home now , Mummy . Soon , baby . As soon as I can , okay ? As soon as I finish here , I 'll be righ home . Now , you get some sleep . I 'll see you soon . - I love you . - Bye . You are at bat , rookie . Captain Rennard 's office , ASAP . - I didn 't do anything ! - Book her . Come on . 'DISTINGUISHED SERVICE' Delon . Come here , Delon . He wasn 't human . He was a monster ! - You got to kill him ! - Okay . Calm down . Just try and calm down . You believe me ! You believe me , don 't you ? You got to get him . But you better bring in a fucking army . Thank you . So I want you two to go out there and bring me the perps . - Is that clear ? - Clear . Now would be a good time . Spacemen and monsters . You got your ray gun , rookie ? Would somebody get this piece of shit out of my office ? Thank you . - There it is . - Video went down . - Turn right . - Confirm . - Here ? - Turn right at the corner . I just don 't get it . How do they expect us to do our jobs ? They don 't support us . They don 't give us shit to work with . Not even give us any food . How do they expect us to live ? Let 's just do our job , all right ? Is this the right place ? I don 't see any cops . - This is it . - I don 't hear any screaming . - What 's that ? - Screaming . The dispatcher heard a cop screaming before his radio went dead . That 's right . Thanks . Movement , there on the second floor . Let 's go . - What are you doing ? - Here ? Grab this . If anything happens , call for backup , okay ? Okay . Okay ? Now go . Don 't be a hero , rookie . Over here . Volker ? Shit ! Mayday . Officer down . Need assistance . Mayday . Come on , answer me , you motherfucker . State your position and condition . Metro Unit 1216 . Officer Volker is dead , the others , too . Is your position secure ? How the fuck should I know ? Just get me some backup here . Can you maintain your current position ? I 'm down to my last clip . I have 12 rounds left . - Get me some backup . - How many suspects ? One . The other officers are down inside . You can have their weapons . Stand by . Stand by for what ? Give me some fucking backup here ! We 'll do the best we can , but we 've got riots all over the damn place . All available units are tied up . There 's also a problem in the State Hospital . There was a- - Hello ? Come in . Hello ? Shit . Hello ? Radio 's dead . Come on . The officer is a rookie . Three months on duty . D-Unit , take the call . This is Unit 7 . We 'll do it . What 's a little more OT ? What do you think ? It 's quiet , huh ? A little too quiet . Weird shit happens in this sector . I don 't like this part of the city . You don 't have to like it . You just gotta do it . Nothing 's moving . Let 's move in . Go . Hold it ! Sit down . Okay . Situation ? The bastard 's inside . He 's gonna come out . Who 's coming out ? The suspect ? - It 's a fucking monster . - Calm down . You fucking calm down . You weren 't just in there . Is he armed ? I don 't know . My partner 's up there . The other unit . Their weapons are in there . - Did you get him ? - Who ? - You used a clip . Did you get him ? - I don 't know . He 's fast . Sneaky . Is your partner still alive ? - No . - What about the others ? - Have you heard them ? - They 're all dead . - The thing tore them up . - Tore them up ? - He cut off my partner 's fucking head . - We 're going in . - Fuck this . - Suspect 's still inside . We are going in . - I 'm not going in there . - Yes , you are . That 's an order . Fuck you . They owe me three weeks back pay . - I 'm not dying for- - - One of us is in there ! - You are going in . - So what ? He 's dead . He 's had his fucking head torn off . I feel sorry for the poor bastard ... but me going in isn 't going make him feel better . I 'll go in there with you . He 's my partner . You sure ? Let 's so . Upstairs there 's a room . He 's inside . You two stay down here . - I 've got a bad feeling about this . - Shut up . I 'm scared enough without your fucking insecurities . He 's gone ! He can 't be ! He didn 't get by me . Don 't you fucking move ! Look out ! - You 're okay ? - Yeah . Check Wocek . She got hit . Down the stairs . - You okay ? - Yeah . Down there . Call for backup ! Faster ! Piece of shit ! Gome on , let 's go . - Go . - Cuzo , God , that hurts . He 's in the vent ! Lose him ? Fuck this ! Let 's secure this area and send someone back for assistance . - This guy could kill someone else . - Kill ? Eat someone else . Did you see what the son of a bitch did ? He eats people . - I know fucking food is scarce- - - How are we set for torches ? Mine 's dead . Any extra batteries ? - I know this place . - We 'll use one torch at a time . You think anybody gives a shit if we catch this guy ? Why do we have to be heroes ? This leads to an old prison . There are dungeons below us . Yeah , the good old days , huh ? There 's only one way in . If he goes into the prison , we have him trapped . - Don 't we have him trapped now ? - No , the vent leads to the prison complex . Either he goes into the prison or he comes out the other side of this building . How do you want to play it ? How are we going to do this ? The guy is gone . You and I go in the vent . You two go around and block the other way out . Maybe we can trap him between us . Go . I can 't believe you 're making us do this . Take your vest off . Take it off . Come on ! Fake passport . You can get into a lot of trouble for those . It 's the only way out of here . There 's no hope . All the good people are leaving . - That 's why there 's no hope . - What ? Let 's go . Get your torch . I 've got one team down , another team missing . I had a man sitting in that chair just this morning ... screaming about monsters and spacemen . And now I look up and I see a real live Army Colonel ... and a goon from some agency ... wondering about what 's going on in Sector E. Look , Captain . I appreciate your feelings . I 'm sure we both do . The man we 're looking for is infected with a new virulent form of malaria . Extremely violent tendencies ... Does ripping off your head fall into the category of violent tendencies ? Captain , we 're going to need to work together on this one . Now , I need you to tell your men not to touch the suspect . The disease is spread by bodily fluids . Are you following me so far ? Gentlemen , he 's all yours . I will find their positions and you can have him . Thanks for your help . Malaria ? Do you really think he believes that ? - I don 't care what he believes . - We need more men on this . Why are we cutting out the cops ? In two hours , our carrier becomes contagious . Tomorrow 5000 people are either dead or psychotic . I don 't even want to think about the next day . We put information like that out on the cop network ... we got our boys in blue packing up their wives and kiddies ... and hauling ass out of here , starting a bona fide panic . We don 't want that . We 're going to work on this one ourselves . No cops , right ? Right ? - This way . - This country is getting so weird . It had to be cannibalism , right ? That shit 's been happening more with all the shortages . It 's getting fucking desperate for some people . The entrance to the prison must be down here . The government has got to get more food . People are starving and going crazy . Are you serious ? This guy is a maniac . - He did not kill them for food . - The fucker had the shit in his mouth . You saw the bodies . He cut off the head . - He did not eat that . - Maybe he was saving it for dessert . You think this guy is a fucking gourmet ? - Why do you think he did it ? - Because he 's a sick fuck , that is why . Perfect ! We 're going after some sick fuck who 's probably got a gun . We 'll blow the bastard away , then we 'll be done . So shut up , all right ? If they got more food out , shit like this wouldn 't be happening . People need to eat . And they got to pay our back salarlies if they want us to go after the sick fucks . You will do your job and you will do it right . I am not getting killed because some asshole didn 't back me up . - Do you get my meaning ? - Relax , will you ? I 'm on your side . Fuck me . This tunnel looks clear . Nice touch . What is it ? Nothing . There ie a piece of metal here . Use your torch . Got it . And tell me if you see anything . - Whaf ? - I wasn 't talking to you . We got a junction coming up , so be ready . We got a junction coming up ! I can 't tell which way he went , so be ready ! How did he do that ? He went in three different directions . I don 't know . Take this one . Call out if you find anything . Don 't take any chances . I need you to do it . I don 't think he 's down there , but we have to check it out . All right . What the hell was that ? Come on . God ! Motherfucker ! Stay there ! - He 's got a gun . - Are you okay ? Flashlight . Quiet . Down in there . You okay ? Couldn 't be better . - I 'm coming down . - No , stay there . He might double back and trap both of us down here . Close call . Really . Flashlight . Hold this . - What is it ? - We 've reached the prison . Flashlight . Okay . Climb on down , slowly . Keep your feet on the back wall and you 'll be okay . - That 's it . - Yeah , I got it . Don 't shoot ! You guys . - Did you see him ? - Who ? Who do you think ? He must have gone by you . We didn 't see anyone . We heard the shot and got here maybe 10 , 15 seconds later . Then we heard you in the vent . We thought you were the suspect . He must have gone by you . - Did he get you ? - Yeah . One sure thing , that son of a bitch has got a gun . No shit . No one got by us . Fuck . The other door . That means he 's in there ! - Motherfucker is in jail ! - There is no other way out . We have him trapped . - What do you mean ? - This was once a prison . - It 's too easy . - Man . What is your problem ? My problem is we got to confirm his capture . He 's right . Do I have your support in this ? We have to be sure . It 's our job , isn 't it ? Stand back ! Don 't fucking do this ! Flashlight . - He 's over there ! - Get up . Delon , get out of there ! Get down . Motherfucker ! You 're going to go in and get that son of a bitch ! He can 't get out . We 've got him trapped . - We know that . - You have to make sure ! Are you insane ? Nobody 's going in there . No fucking way . We 've done enough here . Look at your fucking knee ! Look ! He doesn 't know where he is . He knows exactly where he is ! Exactly ! Son of a bitch . There can 't be another way out . Come on ! You keep on saying that there is no other way out ! How do you know ? How ? Somebody 's got to go get some help ! All right ? - Okay . - All right . Maybe he should call for help . Yeah . I could go for help . Good fucking idea , rookie . - Your ammo . - What ? Leave it here . - It 's all right . - Calm down . Relax . You 're spooked . Get your fucking shit together . Who 's there ? Wocek , is that you ? Fuck ! Come on , son-of-a-bltch piece of shit ! Fuck . Shit ! Help ! Help ! He 's here ! What did he say ? Cuzo ? He screamed . Maybe he tripped or something . Maybe there 's another way out and the fucking maniac got him . Shut up . There is no other way out . You 're going to have to go after him . See if he 's okay . - You can do it . - Cover me . Cover me ! You son of a bitch . Answer me ! Help ! Don 't let him lock us in ! - Fuck . Shit ! - The vent . The vent ! You 've got to find a way to keep it open . Shit ! How long before he goes off ? Sir , we have a witness who may have seen where the carrier went . - Is that the lady , soldier ? - Yes , sir . Which way did you see him go , ma 'am ? She 's German , sir . No English . Get me someone who can speak to this woman . - What do we do ? He got out ! - He could not . - Yes. he did ! - Calm down . Stop telling me to calm down ! We 're fucked here , all right ? We will be if you don 't calm down . So shut the fuck up ! - How is she ? - Bad . - What do you want me to do ? - Find a way out . If we stay here , we 'll die . No one 's going to find us . That whiny bastard went to get help . The killer got him . You heard the scream . - Maybe he got away . - We can 't risk it . - You got to find a way out . - How ? - Where do I look ? - Over there . If he got out , so can you . How does he know so much ? I was asking myself exactly the same question . He knows about police procedure . He knows about the prison . Maybe he was ... - a cop or a guard- - - Or a fucking prisoner . You think that 's why he 's doing this to us ? Revenge ? He planned this whole things ? Maybe not at first , but now . Lie down . Lie down . Come on . You son of a bitch ! Fuck . Shoot the motherfucker ! Shoot ! Are you okay ? We need you to be okay . Keep it together . Come on . Go for help , through the cell block . - I don 't want to die . - You won 't die . We won 't die . Hang in there . Go for help . Go . Shit ! Fuck . Leave them alone , you son of a bitch ! It 's all right , Officer . We 're here to help you . - Where is your team ? - Who the hell are you ? Where 's the carrier ? Is he alive ? Contamination suits ? - What have you done to us ? - Listen to me . We 've got 40 minutes to get in before that guy goes hot . We 've got to find your team . Do you understand that ? Officer , are you all right ? Look at me . We 're losing time . We 've got to go back in . Can you do this ? Team A , let 's move . Go ! If he 's not contagious , why are you guys wearing those suits ? Protocol . What is if ? Spread out . The carrier 's in the area . Be ready . He 's close , people . Look out ! Officer . You 're it . You got to get this guy while there 's still time . Listen ... if he lives , everyone else dies . Do you understand me ? If I don 't come back ... you make sure that gets to my son and he gets somewhere safe . You hear me ? I hear you , Officer . - Officer Delon . - Delon . Shit . Shit . Fuck . Son of a bitch ! No ! Cuzo . Please . Don 't kill me . I want to live . Please . Oh , shit ! Son of a bitch ! Leave her alone ! Come on ! Don 't . No , don 't ! Please ! Don 't ! No ! Kick ! Brace your feet against the pipe . Give your hands some slack . I better get my fucking back pay for this . What took you so long ? I got the son of a bitch . He 's dead . I can 't see him . Where is he ? He 's right ... there . Get those flamethrowers in here , now ! Out of the way ! Coming through . Officer Delon . Easy . - That 'll do , Corpsman . Go on , beat it . - Yes , sir . You know the penalty for this . Sergeant ! Take this woman , get her son ... and escort them across the border . Come with me , ma 'am . The End

 ( WHOOSH ) All right ? Anyone serving or what ? ( WOMAN ) With you in a minute , luv . ( BABY CRIES ) - Hello , Frank . What can I get you ? - Look what I found under the pool table . - Any note ? - No , nothin ' . Oh ! They 've written its name on the side here . " Our Rob or Ross . " Look how it 's spelt . They must 've been thicker than a ticket tout 's wad . - Couldn 't even decide on a name . - Oh , poor little mite . I wonder what 'll become of him ? Somethin ' terrible , no doubt . I hate doing that ! I hate doing that ! ( TINKLING ) Smeg ! I 've just sneezed out me cap ! Just changing your linen before you turn in , sir . Kryten , I 've lost me cap . No , here it is , sir . I 've just finished giving it its monthly scrape . My tooth cap , the one made from the skeleton in medibay . - Oh , I see . - Hey ! Here it is . I need some glue . I 've just got that pointy thing . - Let me see . - No , it 's all needly , pointy and disgusting . Let me see , sir . I 'm a mechanoid . I won 't be revolted . OK . Oh , my God ! It 's hideous ! ( GIGGLES ) Yeah , very funny . Just fix it . I 'll have to prepare some dental adhesive . Give me some wood glue . You can redo it later . Wood glue ? Are you sure , sir ? Don 't get your lips glued together . Oh , incidentally , I just found some old clothes in one of the storage lockers . Hey ! I need a dressing gown . Well , that 's what I thought . I thought if I remove the trim , let it out a bit , obviously dye it , it could be just dandy . Yeah . Nice one , Kryts . Perhaps I could take the necessary measurements now , sir ? I wonder why guys have nostril hair . It 's nature 's way of saying it 's time to buy a flat cap and driving gloves , sir . Worst are those guys who just let it grow . They look like they 've got a loo brush up each nostril or those machines that shine shoes . Curious that most women aren 't similarly afflicted . Obviously , I 'm excluding women who work in Oxfam shops . Hmm ... It evens itself out , doesn 't it ? Women have the agony of childbirth and we have ... this . ( WHINES ) They don 't know they 're born ! What is wrong with me ? Now I 've got a box of floss attached to me face ! Hey ! Nice outfit ! - Did you come here for a reason ? - Oh , yeah ! Something 's showing on the long-range scan which is weird with a capital " WE " . - Can you be a tad more scientific ? - Come again ? Is it a wibbly thing or a swirly thing ? At this stage , I 'd hate to commit myself and wind up looking a fool . See for yourself . Wibbly thing or swirly thing ... and he refuses to commit himself ? He 's losing it . He really is . It 's a power surge causing a major disturbance in the fabric of space-time . It 's also causing a major disturbance in the fabric of my pants ! - It 's almost like a tear . - Perhaps a temporal rip . I 'm gonna try and outrun it . Get real . It 's going faster than a copy of " Hello ! " in a nunnery . Suggest we head straight for the eye of the storm . Cat , go for it , man . The eye of the storm . We seem to be through the worst of it ... but I 'm picking up an energy disturbance down on the engineering deck . According to the psi-scan , the membrane between two realities has temporarily collapsed . This is some kind of hyperway through non-space to a parallel dimension . Let 's have a goosey . ( TEARING AND WHOOSHING ) Careful , sir . The linkway 's as stable as an Italian taxi driver stuck behind two old priests in a Skoda . What the hell is that ? Non-space , sir . An abyss of infinite nothingness where time doesn 't seem to exist . Sounds like Rimmer 's organ recital night . - How 's it going ? - You 're a hologram . - Hard light . - So in your dimension Lister died ? In the radiation leak on Red Dwarf . Why weren 't you put into stasis like me ? Remember coming back from shore leave on Mimas ? I 'd taken a couple of days off to get over Kochanski . Yeah , I remember ... Where the hell have you been ? I 've reported you as AWOL . I 've been on shore leave . Didn 't you get my message ? You should apply to a superior officer before you get shore leave , Lister . Look , since Kochanski split up with me , I 've needed time on my own . - Kochanski dumped you ? - Yeah . - She really dumped you ? - Yes ! You didn 't tell me ! Are you really heartbroken ? - I dunno , man ... - You are , aren 't you ? OK , yes . Yes . Didn 't I say you 'd never bridge that class division ? Take her - navigation officer , cadet school , Space Corps , well-spoken , can stay awake during operas , knows her cheeses . She 's class . And you ? What are you ? I don 't mean to sound cruel , but in comparison you 're second-rate scum . But I used to be fourth-rate scum . I 've dragged meself up by my bootstraps . Listy , Listy , your type isn 't Kochanski , Listy . It 's someone called Tiffany . Someone who drinks Campari and soda and wears orange crotchless panties , someone who thinks deely-boppers are funny , someone who says " sumfink " instead of " something " and laughs like a moose strapped to a cement mixer . This from a man who 's had less sex than a lettuce . Oh , ha-ha ( ! ) People who say " ha-ha " have no sense of humour . They just can 't think of a witty retort . Oh , ha-ha ( ! ) Ms Kochanski , ma 'am . Have you read my proposal for a new Space Corps salute ? I 'm trying to get the support of the officers . It is rather important , because if you like it , that brings the overall total of officers who are right behind it up to ... one . - Rimmer ? - Yes , ma 'am ? - Have sex with someone . That 's an order . - Yes , ma 'am . 'Ere . Ring this number . Say I sent you . Tell them it 's an emergency . - Hi - Hmm ... I just wanted to say , look , I 'm sorry for the Dear John . It was cowardly . What ? Oh , that ! Sorry , I 'd completely forgot . It seems like years ago . - It was last week . - Was it ? - Mm-hmm . - Must 've got over it just like that . Oh , come on , Dave . We weren 't going anywhere . We never got out of bed . There 's more to life than eating delivery curries and having fantastic sex . - I find that hard to believe . - I just want us to be friends . - Do you mean give it another go ? - No , no . - I 'm , er ... back with Tim now . - Tim ? ! That guy is such a poser ! The way he always wears that white suit and floppy hat . He 's a chef . Yeah , but the way he poses around in the officers ' club , smoking black cigarettes . - Such a phoney . - ( MIAOWING ) Do you know what you 'd get for smuggling a cat ? What ? Cat-martialled ? I 'm serious ! As serving N.O. , I 'm supposed to report this ! So report it , get me put into stasis for six months . Don 't you know how dangerous it is to smuggle in an unquarantined animal ? I was lonely . I 'd just been dumped . It breaks every reg in the manual . ( BLEEPING ) Just don 't get caught or I 'm out cold for six months , OK ? So you died with the rest of the crew ? - Then Holly revived me a hologram . - What happened to Kochanski ? They found the cat , and she got six months in stasis . So , does that mean ... ? Hi . - You look great ! - You look pretty amazing yourself . So in this dimension , you didn 't die ? You 're an alternate version of Dave . I think of myself as the definitive version , honed to perfection by time and evolution . I see why you 'd think that . Sirs , ma 'am , we 've scarcely two hours before the dimensional tear self-repairs and we lose the linkway . I suggest we might spend some of that time exchanging supplies and information . We could update your hydrogen RAM-drive to a tachyon-powered core . And in return , we could unscrew any pickle jars you can 't open . - There is something you could do for us . - Yeah ? At some point , I want to have children . It 's a slightly pervy thing to ask as we 've just met , but perhaps you could ... - Yeah ? - After all , we 've been ... you know , lovers ... - Perhaps you could ... - Yeah ? Fill this up . It 's a self-gamete-mixing in-vitro tube . I 'm already in there . It just needs your ... contribution . So it worked out for you guys , then . Congratulations . Gelf ship ! Somehow they managed to infiltrate non-space ! Kris , give me your hand ! Hang on to me feet , man ! It 's gonna give ! ( GRUNTS ) I thought I 'd lost you ! - I think you 've mistaken ... - Shh ! - What were you saying ? - Forget it . Oh , dear ! Sir , I think Miss Kochanski believes that you 're ... - Not now , Kryten . - But you don 't understand . - Miss Kochanski thinks ... - I can handle it . Make some tea . - Er ... Permission to speak , sir ? - Permission refused ! - Wait . This isn 't the medibay . - You must have mistaken me for your Lister . - That 's what I 've been trying to tell you ! - Were you ? If you 'd listened , I could have saved you from all that yuckiness . Is that the kind of guy you are , taking advantage of a woman ? I was gonna tell you , honestly . I was taught not to talk with your mouth full . Wait , you mean I 'm stuck here with you ? Priscilla , Queen of Deep Space ? I need that linkway back ! ( CRASH ) Not at the moment . We 're under attack . - It 's back on our tail ! - What is it ? Some Gelf battle cruiser . They 've sent a scan , sir . Take a look . Oh , my God . It 's the missus . - The what ? - Mr Lister 's Gelf bride . We went to the wedding . It was just beautiful . - He married this ? ! - He had to . - You mean ... ? - We were in a fix ! We needed an engine part . You should visit the orang-utan house at London Zoo . Your eyes would be out on stalks ! They 're opening comms channels . Sir , they 're demanding you return to your bride . In Gelf law , separation is impossible without special dispensation from Hakakhhak-kkhhak ... hhakh-hhakhkhkahak-hkaahkahk-hkhk , Chief Justice of hakhakhk-aahkahkh hkhakkhaakhaaakah-akkk-hhakaaaak kak-akk-hakkakak ka ka ka . OK , patch me into the MCN , and I 'll lay an SS line . - You 'll what , Officer BB ? - Quadrant 4-9-2 stroke G-8-7 , moving across to Quadrant 2 to Q-4-1 stroke 9 . - Just follow my coords . - Your cords ? - Yeah , my coords . - Follow your cords ? - Is that a problem ? - You 're not talking about trousers , are you ? Coordinates . Coordinates ! Thank you ! 20 degrees starboard on this next ' berg . They 're right on our tails . Hold this line . Keep holding ... Keep holding ... Lift now ! Pretty snazzy ! Still no sign of Miss Kochanski 's ship , sir . We 're fast running out of time . - It 's good , isn 't it ? - No , sir . I don 't believe it is . - Don 't you like her ? - I 'm a mere mechanoid , sir . Hardly my place to point out what a ... bossy old trollop she is . - Good kisser , though . - She knew that was you all along , sir ! She was merely trying you out to compare you with her Mr Lister . Apparently , he 's quite something . Initially , a soft-light hologram , that 's made him sensitive and caring in a way most men aren 't . You mean he can remember anniversaries and stay awake after sex ? He 's every woman 's dream guy , sir . He even enjoys shopping for shoes ! - Jesus ... - A human male who 's prepared to have in-depth discussions about " relationships " . - Eurgh ! - This is someone quite exceptional , sir . - Where does that leave me ? - Well , that leaves you ... trying to help me get her back to her rightful ship . She can 't stay here , sir . She just can 't ! Kryten , man , are you OK ? - ( WHINES ) I know we won 't get rid of her ! - Why 's that so terrible ? She 's gonna take you away from me ! I just know it ! - What ? ! - I took her a drink while she was showering . I 've seen her naked ! So ? She 's got all those bits that you like . Kryten , no matter what happens , you and me , we 're compadres , amigos . But that 'll change if she stays ! You 'll end up liking her more ! - I won 't ! I won 't ! - You will ! You will ! I won 't ! I won 't ! I won 't ! - You promise ? - I promise . So if she walked in , took all her clothes off and said , " Oh ! Make love to me , you horny dude , " and I said , " Perhaps you 'd prefer to fold some sheets with me instead , sir ? " What would you do ? What kind of sheets would they be ? Those nice cotton ones with the pattern . - The blue stripy ones or green square ones ? - The green square ones . So , it 's making love to Kochanski or folding sheets with you ? - Can I fold and stack ? - Absolutely . - It 'd be sheets , then . - She 's standing there all naked with all the in-and-out bits all inny and outy ? It 'll be the sheets , Kryt . You and me . Hospital corners . - Really ? - Too true . ( SQUEALS ) You 're lying ! You 're just trying to make me feel better ! Oh ! Why can 't she be more like Mr Rimmer ? He was perfect ! He had hardly any in-and-out bits at all . There 's no one I care more about than you , OK ? I 'd never dump you like she did ! Never ! - That 's not gonna change . - Never ? Never . - ( SQUEALS ) You 're lying ! - I 'm not lying ! Yes , you are ! I 'm going to end up on my own just like on the Nova 5 ! You killed the crew , Kryten ! No wonder you ended up on your own ! It was an accident , but ... But what about before that ? The SS Augustus ? They all died of old age ! You see ? ! ( BLEEPING ) I thought I 'd see if I could help you get out of here . I 've got a positive trans-dimensional trace , but I still can 't re-establish the linkway . I 'm sure it 's to do with electro-magnetic phasing frequencies . - You took the words right out of my mouth . - What about reversing the signal ? We 'll need a power re-route . I 'll take care of that ... whatever it is . It 's the big red button there , sir . Hey , Officer Bud-Babe , that power simillililillum-linilillum drive ? Taken care of . You don 't like me , do you ? - Ma 'am ? - You don 't , do you ? Ma 'am , it 'd be more efficient if we spent our energies trying to re-establish the linkway . - But why ... ? - Please . - I mean ... - Ma 'am ! - I need to know why ! - Do you indeed ? - Yes . - You 're not good enough for him ! That 's all . OK , he may walk around smelling like a Balti house laundry basket , but he doesn 't need you swapping dimensions like there 's no tomorrow and bewitching him with all your ... in-and-out bits , all pointy and unnecessary . You 've got big problems , you know that ? At least I don 't have a ridiculous walk , unlike some people . Huh ! Have you seen the way YOU walk ? I have a perfectly sensible walk . At least I don 't walk like this : ( BLEEPING ) Phaser frequency 4-3-4 . We 've got it back ! What ? You 're right ! That 's it ! - I can leave ! - You can leave ! Champagne , everyone ! If this doesn 't deserve a celebration , I don 't know what does ! - What are we celebrating exactly ? - ( MOUTHS SILENTLY ) You 've found your crewmates ! How wonderful ! - Thanks , Kryten . - I must go and find the others . This is for you . Just pop that in the uterine simulator in your medilab and ... bingo . - Wow ! - Our child . I 'll ... you know . - I know . - I 'll tell it all about you . Just explain why I 'm not there . I don 't want it ending up like me . What happened to you was really rough . The pool table , no note , no explanation ... I think that 's why I spent my early life drifting . I had nothing to live up to 'cause I didn 't know where I came from , just two names they couldn 't decide on calling me - Rob or Ross . Well ... I 'll look after it . You know I will . Yeah , I know . Excuse me , sir . Just doing a spot of dusting here . Look , it 's probably a long shot but it may be possible to communicate trans-dimensionally . See you . Bye . - What 's this ? - Supplies from bud-babe 's ship . - No , this . - It 's the symbol for infinity . The snake eating its own tail , completing the everlasting circle of life . - What 's it doing on here ? - The crate used to contain Ouroboros batteries . - Everlasting . - Ourobo-what ? ! Ouroboros , sir , the name of the symbol . - What is it , bud ? - Ouroboros ... It wasn 't " Our Rob or Ross " , it was Ouroboros . - What was ? - The message on my box ! You came in a box ? That explains everything . I know who my parents are . I understand now . Explain , sir . The in-vitro tube Kochanski 's got . The frozen embryo - it 's me ! We must go back in time and leave me under the pool table at the Aigburth Arms . We wrote Ouroboros on the box to explain ! I 'm my own father ... and Kris is my ex-girlfriend and me mum ! You should write a letter to " Playboy " . I bet it 'd get printed . I 've gotta get that test tube back . Mum , wait ! - What ? - I need the in-vitro tube ! It 's me ! It 's what ? The Gelfs are back ! - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna jump ! - You 'll never make it ! - Kris , no ! - Kristine ! - We 've lost her , sir . No . No ! Kristine ! ( PHONE RINGS ) - Yeah ? - Hi , it 's me . - Hi . - I 've decided to stay . Just one proviso ... - Yeah ? - Save my life , OK ? Cargo bay . Looking now . What 's this ? Mountaineering equipment from Miss Kochanski 's ship , sir . - A crossbow ? - It might be handy if we run into your wife . ( KOCHANSKI ) You 've got about 20 seconds before I 'm out of reachI Rope ? Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! I 'm getting a mite panicky hereI Argh ! Bastard ! ( PHONE RINGS ) It 's an obscene phone call , sir . I think it 's for you . I 've brought you a drink , but don 't think it means I 've gone all mushy on you . I 'm gonna work out a way of re-establishing that linkway . It 's too late , ma 'am . The rip 's self-repaired . - ( WHINES ) We 're stuck with you ! - I 'm gonna try anyway . Oh , ma 'am ? Yes , Kryten ? Welcome aboard . Thanks , Kryten . For a long time , you 'll think that you were abandoned , but you weren 't , man . You were put here to create a paradox , an unbreakable circle . With us going round and round in time , the human race can never become extinct . We 're like ... a kind of holding pattern . I 'll see you , son . # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

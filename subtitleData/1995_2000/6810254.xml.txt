 Is somebody in here ? Holy Moses ! What a way to go . Have you seen this MO before , Detective ? Men cremated alive ? Yeah . Third time this year . Eleventh time , actually . There were three in Seattle , three in LA and two in Boston . All Chinese men between the ages of 20 and 40 . All recent immigrants . We weren 't able to determine any of that until recently . The other two bodies were much more badly burned . - We got lucky with this one . - Lucky ? That 's an interesting word for it . You got any leads on this case , Detective ? Any thoughts or ideas ? We 've got a big influx of immigrants from Hong Kong , trying to get out before 1997 , ... .. and more gang activity in Chinatown . But we can 't tie the deaths to anyone or anything . You got anybody that can read or speak Chinese ? - Yeah . Glen Chao . He 's over there . Why ? - Can you get him ? I want him to read this . Sure . Glen ? One second . - Detective Chao . Glen Chao , Agent Mulder . - Hi . Whaddaya got ? There 's something written on the ceiling . I was wondering if you could read it . Yeah . It says " gwai " . - It means " ghost " . - Ghost ? Mean anything to you ? I don 't know , but it 's a strange thing for a man being burned alive to write , don 't you think ? What 's this ? Does anybody recognise this ? It looks like foreign currency . It 's " hell money " . It 's used as an offering in the Chinese Festival of the Hungry Ghosts . - Is it worth anything ? - It 's not money , per se . It 's a symbolic offering to the evil spirits and the ghosts . For good luck . - Where would I get this hell money ? - There aren 't a lot of places that sell it . Good . Maybe we just found a way to identify the body . His name was Johnny Lo . He moved here about six months ago from Canton . Still in the INS application process . He was a dishwasher in Chinatown . How many dishes d 'you have to break before you get tossed in an oven ? I think it 's pretty clear this is a horrific cult or gang-retribution killing . - Why would he write " ghost " in the oven ? - I don 't know . What about the guard seeing three figures that vanished ? - So now we 're chasing ghosts ? - " Who ya gonna call ? " Ghosts or ancestral spirits have long been central to Chinese life . So the ancestral spirits pushed Johnny Lo in the oven and turned on the gas ? Well , it 'd sure teach him to respect his elders . I checked all the neighbouring buildings . Nobody saw anything , not surprisingly . - What does it say ? - I don 't recognise that . - It could be idiomatic . Some kind of code . - It 's still tacky . - Can you copy it down for me ? - Yeah , sure . Talk about tacky ... Someone 's been here . This place has been cleaned out . Look at this . - What 's that smell ? - Maybe it 's this new carpet . Yeah , that 's what it looks like . Who 'd spring for a new carpet in this dump ? Looks like they saved on carpet tacks . They didn 't even bother replacing the old padding . What 's this ? Chinese herbal medicine . - What about this ? - It 's a dried frog . I think they 're sometimes used as charms . Good health , prosperity , protection . Looks like Mr Lo could have used a little of both . Let 's get this blood tested . I couldn 't tell you what any one of these things are . Well , they 're roots mostly . Ginseng , turmeric . Then you 've got your more exotic stuff : bear gall bladder , snake , shark fin , ... .. usually prepared in a soup or a tea . What had the victim been using ? She says that it 's skullcap root and Chinese angelica . They 're used for painkillers . Does she remember Johnny Lo or remember selling it to him ? Ask her if she knows he 's dead . Ask her if she recognises those characters that were painted on his door . What was that about ? She says that the house was branded a " hongjak " . - " A haunted house . " - Haunted ? - You mean by ghosts ? - Yeah . It 's hard to give it an exact translation , but it 's what I told you about before . The Chinese Yu Lan Ji - the Festival of the Hungry Ghosts . You see , on the 15th day of the seventh moon , ... .. in the Chinese calendar , ... .. it 's believed the gates of hell are opened ... .. and the ghosts of unwanted souls roam the Earth . Believers protect themselves by leaving gifts of food and hell money outside their homes ... .. to appease the ghosts , ... .. to keep them from coming inside and causing trouble . But for some spirits , the ghosts most feared by the Chinese , ... .. there 's no buying them off . The Preta , the ancient ghost of a murdered man ... .. who wanders the Earth exacting his revenge on the living , ... .. or the Wu Chun Gwai , ... .. who collects the souls of doomed men and drags them down to ... .. " Ti Yu " , ... .. to the Chinese hell . D 'you think these murders could be related ? It makes sense . This year 's festival is just about over . What about you , Detective ? Do you believe in Yu Lan Ji ? I find it hard to argue with 2,000 years of Chinese belief - the stuff my parents and grandparents believe in . But the truth is , I 'm more haunted by the size of my mortgage payments . Hey ! What are you doin ' ? A patrolman described three men wearing the same masks as those ID 'd at the crematory . - What were they doing here ? - I don 't know . They were spotted around this grave here , but we can 't figure out what they were up to . - Is this a newly dug plot ? - Yeah . There 's a burial at noon tomorrow . - Chinese ? - I don 't know . We can check . Chao , see if you can get the name of the future occupant here . I still don 't understand what anybody would want with an empty grave . What the hell 's he doing ? Something just occurred to me . Looks like somebody was trying to get two burials for the price of one . What did you find ? A lot . And I haven 't even finished my preliminary visual exam . Look at this . This guy 's like a jigsaw puzzle . These are all surgical incisions . Judging by the colour of the scars , I 'd say they were made in the last year . - What was wrong with him ? - If you ask me , nothing . - Nothing ? What do you mean ? - D 'you know how much the body is worth ? Depends on the body . - I don 't know , a few bucks . How much ? - It 's worth a fortune . You 're saying he was selling his body parts for money ? A kidney , a portion of the liver , a cornea , bone marrow ... A person can lose these things and still cash his Social Security cheques . He won 't be cashing any Social Security cheques . No . But if I 'm right , this is one man who left his heart in San Francisco . Even if you 're right , it doesn 't figure . There 's no long-term business sense to dying . What 's the connection with the crematory deaths ? I only saw one body , but the only thing that wasn 't burned to a crisp on Johnny Lo ... .. was his glass eye . Oh , God . - What 's this ? - Maybe you can tell us . It was found in the body cavity of the man who was dumped in the grave . - This ? - You said the frog was a symbol of luck . Unless this is somebody 's sick joke , I 'd say it must have another meaning . I don 't know what it is . It could be a Triad symbol - something from organised crime . Well , maybe you can tell me this . Have you heard any word on the street about the black-market selling of body parts ? What ? Here , in Chinatown ? This man with a frog in his chest was missing a cornea and a kidney . They were taken prior to the time of death , before the final removal of his heart . And I found what is known as sterile ice on the skin around the incision on his chest . It is the substance that is used to preserve human organs for transplant . I don 't even know where to start . Well , we 're gonna need more help from you than that , Detective . The implication being that I 'm not trying to help ? No . Either you resent us being here , or feel a kind of protectiveness towards your community . Look , you don 't even know what the hell you 're dealing with here . This isn 't some pretty lacquer box you can just take the lid off and find out what 's inside . You might see the face of a Chinese man here , but they don 't see the same face . They see the face of a cop . American-born Chinese - ABC . To them , I 'm just as white as you are . You think , because I speak the language , I can get answers . But what good is an interpreter when everyone speaks the language of silence ? What 's this ? The name of the company that installed the carpet in Lo 's apartment . I just happened to run across it while I was twiddling my thumbs . You coming or not ? I 'm Detective Chao with the San Francisco Police . Could we have a word with you ? I 'm late for work . It 'll only take a minute . Could we come in , please ? Mr Hsin , can I ask what happened to your eye ? Accident at work . Carpet tack . How long have you lived in this country , Mr Hsin ? - Three years . - You live here alone ? My daughter . Mr Hsin , you laid a carpet in an apartment occupied by a man named Johnny Lo . I don 't know the name . The man I work for tells me address only . We contacted the man you work for . He said it must have been a job you took on the side . He has no record of a work order . What was the name of the man who lived in this apartment ? His name was Johnny Lo . He 's dead now . Murdered . And we think that the carpet was laid in an attempt to cover up evidence . Your employer said you usually work ... - D 'you remember who called about the job ? - I don 't know any of this . Thank you , Mr Hsin . If we need you , we 'll get back to you , OK ? Thank you . What 's up ? I 'll tell you in a second . - What was that about ? - He has the back window blocked up . I told him it was a firetrap . D 'you know what this is ? - No . - D 'you know what it says ? - It 's the character for wood . - Wood ? - Why ? What are you thinking ? - That he didn 't have an accident at work . And he 's missing his eye . And I 'd like to know how he lost it . - I say we monitor Hsin 's movements . - I doubt they 're to the ophthalmologist . - You look like you saw a ghost . No , I 'm just jumpy . Any more firecrackers go off , I 'm gonna get out and shoot somebody . - He hasn 't left ? - No , but I 'm glad you 're here . I was about to ask Mr Hsin if I could use his bathroom . You can use the one at St Francis 's Hospital . - What do you mean ? - Chao was attacked in his house tonight . Lieutenant Neary says he 's cut up pretty bad . - Who cut him ? - I don 't know , but we should check it out . - How is he ? - He 's gone . - I went to see him . He 's not in his bed . - Did anybody see him get up ? A nurse said they sewed him up , he went to the bathroom . That 's the last they saw of him . Why would he just take off ? - Can I see his chart ? - His chart ? Sure , I guess . - You wanna see what his injuries were ? - No , his blood type . - His blood type ? - Why would he run ? - You think Chao 's involved ? - Maybe the heel-dragging 's a diversion , ... .. that ghost story 's a ruse . What was the haemo-type of the blood we found on the carpet padding ? Thank you . - Uh , O-negative . - Glen Chao . O-negative . - That 's a coincidence . - Wait a minute . What are you saying ? That the blood on the carpet padding in the victim 's apartment was Chao 's . And I 'd be willing to bet he 's the one that asked for it to be installed . Mr Hsin . Yeah . That conversation they had wasn 't about any firetrap . - We 're looking for Mr Hsin . Is he home ? - No , I 'm sorry . - Are you his daughter ? - Yes . May we talk to you ? - What 's your father involved in , Kim ? - I don 't know . He goes out . I know he does it for me . Because of me . You 're sick , aren 't you ? Uh , I was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukaemia six months ago . But that 's a treatable form of cancer . We have no money or insurance . Now I fear that my father has done something illegal , ... .. that he made mistake and something bad is coming . Who are these men that visit your father ? Oh , I don 't know them . I just know my father say he want out . He want out , but of what I don 't know . - Do you know what this is ? - No . Do you know what it says ? I found it over there by the TV before . It is , uh , the symbol for wood . But in Chinese it also correspond to the eye . Like fire to the heart and earth to the flesh . This is a human leukocyte workup . Was your father rejected as a bone-marrow donor ? Yes , several months ago . This is from the Organ Procurement Organization . It 's dated only a month ago . Your father had an HLA , but he also had his kidneys measured , his liver ... They 're playing some kind of game . Agents Mulder and Scully ? - Thanks . We need some information , fast . - What kind of information ? You had a man named Shuyang Hsin . He had an HLA workup and ... - I think I may know what this is about . - What ? A number of Asian men have come in for antigen workups , ... .. but when we find a compatible recipient for them , their doctor says they 've left the area . D 'you have a number for this doctor ? - 311 Porter , right ? - Yeah . That 's where the doctor 's phone is registered . Hey , Scully , look who 's here . This must be the place after all . It 's definitely not Chinese food I 'm smelling . It smells like rubbing alcohol . Or sterile ice . What 's this ? - What is that ? Sounds like it 's coming from upstairs . Chao ! Hands in the air . Hands in the air ! He 's still alive . What did he say ? He said ... " The game 's not over . " My people live with ghosts . The ghosts of our fathers , and our fathers ' fathers . They call to us from distant memory , ... .. showing us the path . No ghosts called to those men . You did , by preying on their hopelessness and their desperation . Yes , they were desperate . Just as I was desperate when I first came to this country . But I committed no crime . You cheated them out of life , ... .. by promising them prosperity when the only possible reward was death . In my belief , death is nothing to be feared . It 's merely a stage of transition . But life without hope ? Now , that 's a living hell . So , hope was my gift to these men . I don 't expect you to understand . I understand this . You are going to prison for a very long time . Can I talk to you for a minute ? I just got back from the hospital . Hsin 's still in intensive care . - And his daughter ? - The donor procurement organisation ... - .. has put her on the recipient list . - That 's great . - What 's wrong ? - It 's our case against this guy . We 've interviewed everybody we busted at the gaming parlour that night . - And ? - They put up a wall of silence . They claim to be members of a social club , that they saw nothing . What about Chao ? His testimony would be enough to lock this guy up . - We can 't find him . - He was supposed to testify this morning . When he didn 't show , they went to his home . He 's vanished . Like a ghost . Visiontext Subtitles : Natasha Cohn I made this !

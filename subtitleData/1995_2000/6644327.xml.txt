So what i 'm lookin ' at here is a warehouse break-In with nothing stolen , A shootout but no guns , lots of blood but no bodies ... And an f.B.I. Agent who likes to take off all his clothes and talk about space aliens . Fill me in . From the top . Start with your name and birth date . John fitzgerald byers , 11 / 22 in ' 63 . - Seriously . - I was named after jfk . Before the assassination , my parents were gonna call me bertram . Lucky you . Occupation ? I work for the government , for the moment . - What do you do for the government , for the moment ? - I 'm a public affairs officer ... for the federal communications commission . It was in that capacity that i was attending ... the computer and electronics show at the baltimore convention center . [ Byers ] it was where this whole thing started , just this morning . We at the f.C.C. Enjoy forging ... positive ties with the american public . It 's our way of saying , " communication is just another word for sharing . " Hi , guys . You like a button ? Up yours , narc . [ Byers narrating ] of course , some people don 't see it like that . At any rate , that was where i first saw her . Would you like a but-Button ? Uh- - [ Byers narrating ] i 'm still not sure why i did what i did next . It was so unlike me . There was just something about her . Ken , i 'm gonna take a short break , okay ? Whatever . [ Beeping , chirping ] [ Man ] hello , pretty lady . Picture this . Crystal-Clear television . Thirty-Three channels ' worth , with no monthly cable bill . Excuse me ? Now , i know what you 're thinkin ' . " Melvin , are you outta your mind ? No cable bill ? " But that 's exactly what i 'm saying , and i 'm talkin premium channels here too .

I heat-Sink every breadboard . Yeah , what about co-Ax loss ? Do you use the rg-6u or the 52-Ohm rg-8 ? [ Blond man ] trick question . It 's a 99-13 . Big man . [ Fake cough ] narc ! Oh ! Ah- - Oh , god . Sorry . I 'm sorry . She 's very cute . Yes , she is . Thank you . Wait . Um , uh- - You just look like you could use some help . So my daughter turned three years old last week . Last tuesday was her birthday . I hope he remembered that . Her- - Her father took her from you ? My former boyfriend . He kidnapped her . It 's a long story . Basically , i got involved with a man who turned out to be a complete psychotic . Yeah ? We were only together a few months . I was attracted to him because he was dark and mysterious , And then he just kept getting darker and more mysterious . I got pregnant , and he left . [ Sniffles ] and then he suddenly came back ... and took her about six months ago . That 's terrible . Did you call the police ? Of course . [ Sniffles ] The police , then private investigators . They were surprisingly unhelpful . That 's unbelievable . Yeah . Well- - [ Sniffles ] at least i managed to get a couple of leads . I was told he 's in the baltimore area . So here i am . Well , that 's a start . Yeah . Except he now knows that i 'm looking for him ... and the closer i get , the more dangerous he becomes . Are you ... worried he might harm your daughter ? Let 's just say i wanna find her , not him . [ Sniffles ] This is the only other lead i 've got . That 's why i 'm here today . This has something to do with computers . Doesn 't it ? With the internet ? Actually , the arpanet . It 's a government network created by the defense advanced research projects agency . You can access it through the internet , though . Somehow this means something to my ex-Boyfriend . I was hoping it might be a means of finding my daughter . If you want , I can go on-Line , try and find out for you . Would you ? Oh , that w- - I would really , really appreciate that . Uh , by the way , my name 's john . Holly . It 's nice to meet you . Holly . Just like the sugar . [ Chuckles ] Yeah . Just like the sugar . Funny . [ Beeping , chirping ] Ken , could you maybe go take a short break ? Whatever . Okay . [ Sighs ] let 's see here . So your ex-Boyfriend is into computers ? I don 't really know . I know very little about him , - Except that he 's psychotic . - [ Computer beeps ] [ Keys clicking ] [ beeps ] Somehow this kicked us into the defense data network . I 'm sorry . I think this is the end of the line . Isn 't there something you could- - I mean , how do you say it- - Hack into ? " Hack into " ? No ! Um- - I mean , technically , yes , i probably could , But- - But this belongs to the department of defense . This is a secured site . I mean , i work for the f.C.C. This is the kind of thing we 're trying to stop . Thank you , john . I appreciate your time . Wait . You didn 't see this . [ Keys clicking ] [ Computer beeps ] [ Holly ] what did you do ? It 's a government system . I know a couple of log-In / out tricks with the vms version five . Never mind . Can you look up susanne modeski ? That 's my daughter . I 'll try . There 's just no way of telling . - [ Beeps ] - Whew . [ Holly ] what is that ? It 's an encrypted file . Why would your three-Year-Old have an encrypted file ... in a secret defense department database ? Can you decode it ? I 'd need some help . Can you print it out for me ? My god ! Hide . What ? My ex-Boyfriend is out there . The psychotic ? He must have tracked me here . H-He 's looking for me . Damn it ! There he is . You look like a gentleman who 'd appreciate 33 channels of crystal-Clear television . No , thanks , handsome . Ah , a man of distinction . Punk ass . [ Byers ] it was at this point we enlisted the help of one melvin frohike ... computer hacker . Oh , hello , pretty lady . Oh , yeah . What 's with the narc ? We proceeded to tell him the entire story . I hoped he could assist me in deciphering the encrypted file . [ Byers narrating ] it was at this point , however , that mr . Frohike raised ... an interesting question . I don 't understand . Why don 't you just kick this guy 's ass ? What ? No . I just want these pages decoded . Can you do that ? Sure , baby . My kung fu is the best , but it could take hours . I say , cut to the chase . If pretty boy can tell us where your daughter is , we just beat it out of him . Bad idea . He 's very dangerous . Lady , i 'm dangerous . All right . So we 'll just follow him . For all we know , he 's got the girl here somewhere . Holly , it makes sense . No . Just stay away from him . We 'll stay back a ways . Just wait for us here . Come on , f.C.C. But- - Uh- - Uh- - [ Frohike ] what 's he doin ' ? [ Byers ] talking to somebody . This dude doesn 't look so tough . Act casual . [ Male voice over loudspeaker ] they 're here . Alien invaders are among us . Detect their presence with high-Tech , modern electronics . [ Beeping ] oh ! Sorry . They 're here . Alien invaders ... [ byers ] he 's moving . Are among us . Detect their presence with high-Tech , modern electronics . What 's up , fellas ? You looking for somebody ? Just , um , the bathroom . I don 't think it 's down here . Hey , you with the f.C.C. ? What 's it to you ? I think we share the same credit union . Special agent fox mulder . I 'm with the federal bureau of investigation . I was hoping maybe you could help me . I 'm looking for a girl . I was wondering if you 'd seen her . This is her here . You seen her ? Sorry . Hmm ? What did she do ? What 's it to you ? Thanks , guys . All right ? [ Phone ringing ] Yeah , mulder . Oh , hey , reggie . What 's up ? What was that all about ? Her ex-Boyfriend is with the f.B.I. ? Where 'd she go ? [ Man # 1 ] okay , stand back , folks ! [ Man # 2 ] hey , guys , just wait a minute . Excuse us here . Hey , come on ! [ Man # 1 ] let us through . - Ken ? - All i did was play dig dug . I didn 't hack into anybody 's computer . [ M.P. ] Excuse us , please . [ Ken ] seriously , guys , I 've got , like , a circulatory problem . I have a tendency to fall down a lot . Wait . It was me . What are you doing ? Ihacked into their computer . So you 're gonna turn yourself in ? Are you crazy ? A hacker never turns himself in . I am not a hacker . Listen . We got f.B.I. Agents running around , military police . Whatever the hell is going on around here , it 's big , And your lady friend is somehow at the center of it all . She needs my help . How can we learn what 's going on ? The f.B.I. Are looking for her . Hack into the f.B.I. Mainframe . I know just the guy who can do it . You 're talking about a premeditated crime ... against the united states government . Hey . Your second one today . Welcome to the dark side . [ Man ] okay , ladies , who 's down for 50 ?

I don 't take no personal checks from the bank of middle earth . Come on , natural 20 . Daddy needs a new sword of wounding . [ Creaking ] What 's the big idea bringing ' the narc in here ? Me and the narc have a proposition for you . What proposition ? The coolest hack in the world . Lord manhammer ? Say it . Say it . Your kung fu is the best . [ Chuckling ] Here . Make yourself useful . - What does this do ? - Besides overheat and burn the hotel down ? It 's a loop-Line shunt . Anyone who tries to trace us will get bounced around ... by c and p 's call-Forwarding software . My personal invention . Oh , god . I 'm gonna get fired . I 'm gonna go to jail . I deserve to go to jail . Shut up already . What do you need me to do ? Just watch and learn . Bingo . Government hack is a snap . Last week i got into the maryland d.M.V.

All i did was try to quit . I don 't have a job you just quit . What about your daughter ? I don 't have one . I 'm sorry . - The photo ? - Came with the wallet . You wouldn 't have believed the truth , obviously , And i desperately needed your help . For what , exactly ? To get this . I still need it deciphered .

One i unwittingly ... helped to forward by developing the ergotamine-Histamine gas . - Ergotamine-Hista- - - E-H , for short .

About john f . Kennedy ? Dallas ? I heard it was a lone gunman . [ Sirens wailing in distance ] [ Byers narrating ] and that was the last we saw of him . Almost immediately , the police got there . We ... panicked and hid . You know the rest . Do i look like geraldo to you ? Don 't lie to me like i 'm geraldo . I 'm not geraldo ! [ Gasping , exhaling ] [ Langly ] oh , man . It 's not all a bad dream . [ Langly ] i am in hell . Oh . Women . Ain 't it the truth . What do you mean , " women " ? You know exactly what he means . Your molar-Pullin ' girlfriend roped us in and left us swingin ' in the breeze . - Is that what you meant ? - Look . Sheishot . But you gotta admit , we 're here because of her . I 'm here because i wanted to learn the truth . I assume that was the same for you . Susanne opened my eyes to it . She doesn 't owe me anything . If there was some way i could help her still , I 'd- - I 'd do it in a second .

I just spoke with my a.S.A.C. , and he tells me that dr . Susanne modeski ... is no longer wanted by the f.B.I. She 's still missing , but the case is suddenly closed . What i need from you guys is to tell me what the hell happened last night . You want the truth ? Yeah , i want the truth . You might want to sit down . This is gonna take a while .

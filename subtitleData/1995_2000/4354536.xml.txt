 [ Miss Parker ] Apparently Jarod 's been working at this university ... doing some type of genetic engineering with plants . - You think he 's in here ? - [ Miss Parker ] Lights are on . Somebody 's home . - Willie , go get him . - My pleasure . Jarod ! Freeze ! - [ Grunts ] - Time to come home , genius . L - I 'm-I 'm not him ! [ Grunts ] - You 're not who ? - Whoever you 're looking for . Well , then , who the hell are you ? L-l-I 'm the guy who waters the plants . - Name 's Francis . - Well , Francis , do you know this man ? Jarod . Yeah , he 's the , uh ... scientist who used to work here . - " Used to . " - Yeah . Like I told the other guy that was looking for him ... - he 's gone . - Someone else is looking forJarod ? Yeah . The blind guy - kind of Chinese-looking . Said his name was Mr. , uh - [ Snaps Fingers ] Lee . [ Man , Asian Accent ] I have absorbed all the files on Jarod . Yes , everything you gave me from his childhood to the present . No . He 's quite an interesting man . There are seven people I need to speak with . You get me those seven people , and I will deliverJarod . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Woman ] For those who can see , we must really be a sight . - Why is that ? - You know , the blind leading the blind . - [ Both Laugh ] - Please , no more blind jokes , Miss Newton . - No , you can call me Rachel . - Ah , Rachel . - And I am Mr. Lee . - Uh , who-who 's typing ? Ah . Her name is - [ Speaking Chinese ] - Anna , for short - my new associate . - How exactly can I help you ? I believe you once knew a man named Jarod . Ah . Jarod helped me after I lost my sight in a terrorist bombing . He 's helped lots of people who have been victimized . He taught me to see again ... so to speak . Why do you want to know aboutJarod ? I have reason to believe that he is in trouble . - I need you to help him . - How can I help ? I 'm sure you realize ... that the loss of vision ... often nurtures deeper insight . And you feel I 've developed this insight ? But of course . That is why I brought you here . Please , tell me howJarod ... helped you and affected your life . I metJarod while I was still in therapy ... not long after the bombing . I was ... drawn to him right from the start . It was like he felt my pain , my fears . [ Rachel 's Voice ] Six ... seven ... eight ... nine ... ten - - You can stop counting . You 're here . - Oh . - [ Chuckling ] - You must have stepped into the room . - It 's 11 steps to the door . - I did . That 's very good . - It 's a beautiful day . Why don 't we go outside ? - Oh , no . L-l - I think I 'd rather stay here . Rachel . You have to go outside sometime . I was supposed to work in my studio ... but it was such a nice day , I decided to go on the rooftop of city hall . That 's what happened the last time I went outside . You were in the wrong place at the wrong time . That is not your fault . You can 't stop living your life because of it . You know , when I had my eyes behind the camera ... I could see things no one else could see . I can remember details of nearly every picture I ever took . That 's ironic . They tell me he was there that day . I must have seen the man who did this to me as he was setting his bomb . But as hard as I try , I can 't remember . So , are you saying that ... Jarod connected with you emotionally ? Oh , it was more than that . It was almost like he became me . He seemed to know me , understand me ... more than I knew myself . The way he enabled me to face my life again was magical ... like an artist painting a picture , only ... Jarod was the painter , and I was the canvas . - [ Rachel ] Is this some kind of new therapy ? - [ Jarod ] Call it a simulation . I 'm going to create an environment ... with all the stimuli you need to recreate an event . - And for you to become someone . - Who do you want me to become ? - Yourself . - [ Gasps ] Oh , my camera . Oh , I haven 't touched this since the - well , since the day at city hall . Now , I want you to develop that roll of film [ Camera Clicks ] - the pictures you took that day . - Oh , but there 's no film in it . - I know . I want you to develop the pictures in your mind . I 'm on the rooftop at city hall . The natural light is at its perfect angle . The building is - is closed . It 's Sunday ... and I 'm getting last minute shots for my gallery opening . - [ Jarod ] Are you alone ? - I think - I don 't see anyone . I don 't - I don 't see anyone ... but I - I feel a - tingle on the back of my neck . - Go on . - I don 't see anyone , but I hear something . - What do you hear ? - Footsteps walking ... quickly away . It 's right before it happens . Rachel , do you see the bomb ? It 's only an instant before the flash . - Do you see him ? - No . But I smell something . - I smell - - You smell him . It must be - It 's cologne . Thank you . Because of what he found in my mind ... Jarod was able to catch the bomber ... and help me find the courage to believe in myself again . That 's very interesting . Anna ? Thank you for everything . My assistant , Anna , will take you home now . You know , you were right about insight , Mr. Lee . You don 't want to helpJarod . You want to catch him . [ Chuckles ] But you won 't succeed . He 's too smart , even for you . [ Miss Parker ] Who the hell is Mr. Lee ? What does a blind Chinese man want with Jarod anyway ? The same thing anyone else would - an advantage . Jarod 's a very valuable commodity . Question is ... - who wants to trade in him ? - None of this makes any sense . Broots , go back toJarod 's last lair . Check the neighborhood ... the airport , the train station anywhere that someone might have seen this Mr. Lee . - Okay . I 'm also interested in finding out about our sightless friend . Keep Bridget up to speed on any new developments . She 's my liaison in this thing . [ Giggles ] Since when do I need a liaison to my own father ? Since you 're not the only ones afterJarod . But don 't worry , angel . It shouldn 't be that hard to catch a blind man . - All you have to do is open your eyes . - Mmm . [ Man ] What 's goin 'on ? - [ Buzzer Sounds ] - Some people want to talk to you . [ Indistinct Shouts ] - [ Cell Door Slams ] - [ Man Scoffs ] So what 's this ... free egg roll night on the " Ginsu " ? " Ginsu " - That 's Japanese . A man of such erudition ... a scholar , a physician . [ Chuckles ] This imprisonment must have reacquainted you with the low , common man . [ Snickers ] Perhaps that 's his idea . Hmm . Dr. Fein , you may address me as ... Mr. Lee . Well , Mr. Lee . I don 't know what this is about , but - This is about an acquaintance of yours whom I 'm searching for . His name is Jarod . You gotta be kidding . For 18 months , I 've been trying to tell people aboutJarod . But there 's no trace of him . It 's like he never existed . - You seem frustrated . - Frustrated ? That psycho 's the reason I 'm spending the rest of my life in an eight-by-eight cell . - Sue me if I 'm frustrated . - [ Laughs ] Dr. Fein , you did bury an innocent man alive . - You got a point ? - Yes . Jarod , in his unique way , merely exposed you to the rest of the world . What is one man 's justice is another man 's revenge . Yeah , well , a lot of good that 's gonna do me now . [ Rattling ] Dr. Fein , would you like to seeJarod ... in an environment worse than this ? - Can you do that ? - If you tell me what he did to you . What he did ? He tried to kill me . He tried to bury me alive . [ Grunting ] Ugh ! - [ Gasps ] - Trick or treat . - You scared the hell out of me . - Well , that is , after all ... what this holiday is all about , isn 't it ? Oh , you 're too late . He 's gone . - Who 's gone ? - Enrique , the young man you killed . - What kind of sick prank are you tryin ' to play ? - Oh , this isn 't a prank . It 's a life lesson . You know , in some cultures they believe ... that the spirit of a man killed in anger returns ... to exact revenge upon his perpetrator . - Spooky , huh ? - I 'm gettin ' out of here . Oh , no , you can 't leave , Dr. Fein . This is the Day ofthe Dead . And you , sir , are the special guest . Let me out ofhere ! Jarod ! This isn 't funny ! I know . It would be awful to be buried alive ... especially with that on your shoe . Jarod ! Jarod ! Shh , shh , shh , shh . There 's no reason to wake the dead . - You 're gonna be joining them soon enough . - Jarod , please ! Did Enrique discover that you had killed ... one of the research subjects he recruited for you ? - You 're crazy ! - Uh-uh-uh . That is not a very nice thing to say ... to a man with a shovel ... - is it ? - Jarod , please ! You took an innocent homeless man ... and you turned him into your guinea pig - someone to test your heart drug on ... someone that you didn 't think would be missed if it didn 't work . Well , it didn 't work , did it ? And someone did miss him - Enrique . So you buried him alive to save your research , didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Yes ! Yes ! Now let me out of here ! Screaming isn 't going to help you conserve your oxygen . And believe me , you 're going to need all you can get . - No . No . No , Jarod ! - Happy Halloween . Jarod . Ja-Jarod . Jarod ! Jarod ! Jarod ! [ Cackling ] [ High-pitched Vocalizing ] [ Laughing ] I can imagine . Perhaps that 's his way of dispensing emotional justice . How 's any of this gonna help you find him ? Oh , you helped me a great deal already . You told me who he is ... and what he is . [ Chuckles ] And , oh , yes ... I 'll catch him . [ Whirring ] Mr. Lee here . After interviewing the first few subjects ... I 'm finding Jarod even more challenging ... than initially anticipated . [ Chuckles ] Jarod , I 'll never be able to do this . Sure you can . We 'll keep on practicing . His desire to help other people and his determination for justice ... are unyielding . [ Chuckles ] But they will also prove to be his downfall . Mmm . - [ Typing ] - Thank you . - You 're welcome . - [ Typing Continues ] In many ways , Jarod is the most compassionate man I 've met . It 's almost as if it 's his natural state ofbeing . - [ Mr. Lee ] How is that , Miss Granger ? - He has a way of connecting ... with others - to their souls - in a way that I 've never seen in any other person . - It 's ironic , really . - Ironic ? He can be so there for other people . And yet inside , he 's so alone . I 'll never forget the day he walked into my office . [ Granger ] Mrs. Morgan , we may have a sighting on your daughter . If all goes well , you should have your arms around Catherine by tomorrow night . Thank you . God bless you too . How can I help you ? I don 't know who I am . [ Granger ] As I looked in his eyes , I could feel his pain ... - his sadness . - So , Jarod came to you ... - for help . - Yes . That 's what I do - reunite families , find missing children . I help people find their pasts , so they can have a future . - [ Mr. Lee ] I see . - I thought I 'd seen it all ... until I heard Jarod 's story . - I 'm looking for my parents . - Are they still alive ? I don 't know . I was never told the truth . Well , why not use the police database to initiate a search ? I can 't . Look , this is probably gonna be hard to understand ... but I don 't have much time - 72 hours . - Without a name - - I have a picture . It 's my mother . At least , that 's what I was told . - I 'll see what I can do . - Thank you . So , you were able to giveJarod the identity ofhis mother . No . These people came and took the information . They destroyed it beforeJarod even had a chance to see it . That must have decimated his soul . Actually , it seemed to inspire him ... to help other people who experienced a similar loss . - Really ? - Over the last three years ... he 's helped me locate and reunite ... nine children with their families . And each time , he refuses to take ... any credit or recognition for what he 's done . - A very resilient soul . - Like I said ... Jarod 's the most compassionate human being I 've ever met . [ Foghorn Blowing ] [ Foghorn Blowing ] [ Buoy Ringing ] You were right . It wasn 't that hard to track Mr. Lee . I mean , most people you talk to have never seen an old blind Chinese guy . Well , at least not since Kung Fu . Well done , Grasshopper . [ Clears Throat ] I found out ... Mr. Lee 's a pretty infamous guy in Hong Kong as well . Not only does he find people , but he makes them disappear in little pieces . If we play our cards right , we 'll bring him in in one piece . - Let 's move . - Get in position . [ Sam ] Yes sir , Mr. Lyle . - It 's more difficult than I thought . - [ Typing ] I 'm learning thatJarod is very complex - very yin and yang ... dangerous and yet in control ... full of great pain ... but a source of healing to others . [ Chuckles ] Yes . He 's , uh , capable of bringing justice ... against the powerful and yet showing mercy to the weak . He helps the lost to find themselves ... but is unable to discover his own true nature . [ Chuckles ] - Ironic , isn 't it ? - [ Typing Continues ] Anna ? I think we have visitors . [ Miss Parker ] We need to move . Patience , Parker . The Sweepers aren 't even in position yet . Lee has no idea we 're out here . You start stumbling around , and you 're gonna blow it all . I know exactly what I 'm doing . We 're gonna go in ... and bring out the blind man . Let me show you how this is done . [ Door Opens , Bell Chimes ] You idiot , we 've been made . Get in ! - [ Engine Starts ] - Miss Parker , that 's a wall . Yeah , and this is a rental . - [ Tires Screeching ] - Whoa ! Whoa ! [ Tires Screeching ] Damn ! He was right here ! - So , this is how it 's done ? - Outside ! He couldn 't have gotten far . - Wow . Mr. Lee 's like a Shaolin priest . - What are you talking about ? Well , you know , " Look , for he cannot be seen . - Felt , for he cannot be touched . " - Oh , get a life , Kato . What 's this ? Braille . Great . - In case you 've forgotten . - What is it , Syd ? Names of people involved with Jarod . - Why ? - He 's been interviewing them . - How would Mr. Lee know about them in the first place ? - Someone at the Centre . Broots , I want you to trace all calls coming into and out of this warehouse . Let 's find out who Mr. Lee 's working for and why . - Okay . - Sydney , who do you think they are ? Whoever they are , these must be some very special people . - Love the shoes . - Thank you very much . Do you always wear that ... getup ? Well , I can see you don 't fully appreciate ... the incredible burden of my responsibility . You 'll have to excuse Mr. Lyle . [ Sucks Teeth ] He 's not a fan . But I am , Bernie . And I do appreciate you taking time ... out of your busy schedule to talk to us . Well , I always got time to spend with a pretty lady . [ Chuckles ] Tell us , what did Mr. Lee want to know aboutJarod ? [ Sighs ] How I felt about him ... minute by minute , from the very instant we met . Now don 't you little ladies forget . Come and see my show tonight . There 's no cover , there 's no minimum , and there 's free hot ... - [ Women Squealing ] - hors d 'oeuvres , huh ? - I 'll see y 'all later . Bye-bye . - Bye ! Thank you very much . [ Grunts ] Hey , there , teddy bear . You comin ' to rub elbows with the King of Rock and Roll ? No , I 'm tryin to understand this . You dress up in a rented costume ... - and you pretend to be a dead singer ? - " Singer " ? Son , do you have any idea who I am ? - Well , actually , I would - - You are looking at a national monument - Mount Rushmore in blue suede shoes . There 's not a human bein on God 's green earth ... that has ever demanded the attention and respect ... of the man you are lookin ' at this very moment . Hey , Bernie ? Some guy at the craps table says ... - he 'll give you five bucks to goose his wife . - I 'll be right there . Well , my fans beckon . I must go . Thank you very much . To tell you the truth , I 'd read Jarod all wrong at first . - How so ? - Well , just like I told Mr. Lee ... it turned out that he was the only person ... who really cared about what I was goin ' through . Hey . Well , welcome to the Heartbreak Hotel . [ Laughs ] What are you doing here ? You should be on stage . Oh , no . There-There 's no more stage for the King . The casino fired me . Did it have something to do with that bird thing ? - Bird thing ? - The goose . No . No , they said they 'd had complaints about the show . So I put on 20 , 30 pounds . You think it 's easy bein 'the idol of millions ? - I would guess no . - Well , you 're damn right it isn 't . I sacrificed everything . I did it ' cause I loved it . It 's what the people wanted . I just wish some of those casino bigwigs could spend one hour wearing 'the cape , huh ? Just one hour . I tell you what-They 'd walk away singin a different tune . I guaran-damn-tee you . Couldn 't you get a job at another casino ? No , buddy boy . After 24 years of makin ' people smile ... singin ' the songs and ... spreadin' the good vibrations ... afraid it 's the end of the line for the King . We did have one hell of a ride , though , didn 't we ? - I bet you did . - Now , look . I 'm - I 'm sorry . L - I 'm spillin ' my guts and I don 't even know your name . Jarod ... Felson . Bernie Baxley . Well , it 's nice to meet you , Bernie Baxley . Thanks . Jarod ? I 'm scared . - Of what ? - Him . Jarod helped me to face my fears ... to find me again . L - I got to admit , he , uh , kind of rubbed off on me a little bit . But I 'll tell ya - I think I rubbed off on him a little bit too . [ As Elvis ] Well , thank you very much . After that , I left Vegas . Never looked back . And thanks toJarod , I 've got my own place in Branson ... where the King 's legacy is kept alive 363 days a year ... closed only for New Year 's and , of course , the King 's birthday . Ow . I threw out my hip dancing ' about a year ago . ButJarod had taught me that you gotta keep on adapting ' . You know , keep - keep lookin ' for new and - and better ways to move and groove forward . So I broadened my repertoire . Thought maybe I 'd treat you folks to , well , just a taste of my new act . Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome to the stage ... Tiny King . Huh ? [ Chuckles ] Hey , TK , don 't you want to say somethin ' to the pretty lady ? Ooh , you look better than a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Forced Chuckle ] - Thank you very much . - [ Laughs ] [ Chuckling ] Sam ? Get him out of here before I step on his blue suede face . Yes , Miss Parker . Excuse me , King ? - Yeah ? - It 's time to leave the building . Ah ! - Got to TCB . - [ Clucks Tongue ] You did say these people must be ... special . What the hell is going on , Sydney ? Lee has been interviewing every one of those people ... about their emotional connection toJarod ... in order to anticipate ... his next move . Miss Parker . Uh - Uh - - What is it ? - I traced the last call from Mr. Lee 's warehouse ... to the Centre , and you won 't believe where it ended up . - Spit it out , Broots . - Well , it went to your father 's office . - [ Footsteps ] - Mmm . [ Chuckles ] Uh-huh . Yes . The next subject may be reluctant to cooperate . - Let me bring him in . - [ Chuckles , Speaks Chinese ] Violence was not on your résumé . [ Chuckles ] I 'll have to write a new one . Hmm . [ Reads Aloud In Chinese ] Trouble ? Oh , yeah . The battery 's busted or something . Oh , well , maybe I can help . - Really ? You don 't mind ? - Um ... I 'm not much of a mechanic , but I am pretty good with my hands . [ Groans ] [ Handcuffs Rattling ] - Ah . Mr. Lee . - [ Speaks Chinese ] I believe you have met my assistant , Anna . Met her ? She kidnapped me . Oh , really ? [ Laughs ] Please , sit down . I don 't feel like sitting down . Oh . Excuse my urgency ... but it is important that I know about ... your relationship with Jarod . Really ? Well , I 'd like to know about your relationship with Jarod . Mr. Lyle , in life it is primary ... that one knows his position . And you , sir , are not in position to ask questions . Look , I don 't know what you 're up to ... but I think it 's time somebody taught you some manners . [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] [ Lyle Grunts ] Oh , I 'm sorry . Did I hurt you ? It is not only with sight that one sees . Let me help you . - Once again , Mr Lyle , go sit down . - [ Grunts ] - And tell me your story . Hmm ? - [ Grunts ] - What do you want to know ? - I want to know ... what motivates Jarod ... why he risks himself to help others ... why he runs ... but does not vanish . Well , why do you think I can help you ? Coochie , coochie , coochie , coochie . [ Laughs ] Because you have a very unique relationship with Jarod . You did try to kill him , did you not ? All in the interest of science . - [ Instruments Beeping ] - Clear ! Clear ! - It really wasn 't my idea anyway . - [ Laughing ] - It really wasn 't my idea anyway . - [ Laughing ] I believe you also kidnapped Jarod . Huh ? Desperate times call for desperate measures . " Desperate times call for desperate measures , " Anna . So , you weren 't content just to kidnapJarod , were you ? You also have to shoot his brother and kill him . That was an accident , pure and simple . This is beautiful ! It 's just one big happy family , isn 't it ? It 's the end of the line , Lyle . There 's no place left for you to run . I 'm disappointed in you , Jarod . You know me better than that . Drop the cannon , kid . - Shoot him , you moron ! - Shut up ! Stay back , or I put a very large hole in big brother . - Kyle . - Threats and pain ... that 's all you 've ever offered us . You stole our lives , and you killed our spirit ... and now you think you can threaten us with death ? It doesn 't matter , Lyle . Because we never made a difference anyway . I 'll kill him . I swear I will . And then I 'll kill you . Don 't do this , little brother . - [ Grunts ] - [ Groans ] [ Yells ] [ Kyle Groans ] There 's another part about what drives Jarod that l-l - I don 't understand . - And that is ? - [ Chuckles ] Why , after all you 've done to him ... he has not killed you . After all ... he is more resourceful and intelligent than you are . Maybe he just likes me . Not . [ Chuckles ] Shall we start from the beginning , all over again , huh ? - [ Miss Parker ] Where the hell is Lyle ? - [ Sydney ] I don 't know ... but he seemed genuinely disturbed over the revelation ... that Mr. Lee is in contact with your father 's office . Well , we 're not waiting any longer . - Let 's go ahead and talk to this guy . - Hmm . - Hi . - Hi . Hi , J.R. My name is Sydney . This is Miss Parker . Miss Parker ? You sure look familiar . I have one of those faces . Listen , J. R ... it 's very important that you tell us exactly what Mr. Lee wanted to know aboutJarod . Is Jarod in some kind of trouble ? - He might be . - I 'll do anything to help him . He saved my life twice . Once before I even met him . J. R ? Honey ? Sweetie , can you hear me ? J. R ? - [ Jarod ] He 's in shock . - Wake up . - He 's still breathing . - [ Mother ] He 's hypoglycemic . - When was the last time he ate ? - He had cereal for breakfast three , four hours ago . J. R ? Come on , honey . What do you think you 're doing ? I need to stabilize his blood sugar . Stick this in your mouth . I want you to let it dissolve , okay ? Good boy . - Mom ? - Oh ! Oh ! It 's okay , honey . Everything 's gonna be okay . Mr. Lee seemed real interested in the fact thatJarod knew I was sick . - Your heart . - I needed a transplant . My mom had pretty much given up hope that I 'd get one in time ... untilJarod came into our lives . - How is he feeling ? - [ Mother ] Better . He has a heart condition . I noticed the bluish tint to his fingertips and his lips . I 'd say by the looks of it , you have a very sick boy . - Are you a doctor ? - Not at the moment . Why hasn 't he had a heart transplant ? Because he 's on a waiting list . Because he has AB-negative blood , which is very rare . - It only happens in certain families . - One in 300,000 . I know . I have it too . You said Jarod saved your life twice . He found me a heart . You stay with me , little brother . I 'm gonna get you to a hospital . [ Weakly ] It 's too late , Jarod . Don 't you say that . Look at me ! Come on , just-just think - Think about all the good times we 're gonna have together . - I 'm sorry , Jarod . - For what ? F-For everything . [ Kyle Gasps ] No . [ Sobs ] - Jarod gave you his brother 's heart . - Yeah . And ever since the transplant , he calls . Notjust to check up on me ... - but to see how I 'm really doing . - Mmm . Jarod 's like the older brother that I never had . Mr. Lee seemed to think that was real important . Thank you , J.R. Sam will take you home . Come on , Tin Man . [ Basketball Bouncing ] Mr. Lee 's really narrowing it down . Compassion , empathy , desire for justice - all the things that makeJarod , Jarod . Do you think he 'll be able to anticipateJarod 's next move ... - to actually catch him ? - Unless we get there first . - [ Metal Clanging ] - Miss Parker ? Miss Parker . [ Clears Throat ] About that phone call from Lee to your father 's office ? - What about it ? - Well , it wasn 't actually for Mr. Parker . Well , did it go to his office or didn 't it ? Yes . Tech - I mean , technically , yes . - Technically ? - Well , there was a second phone line ... recently installed in your father 's suite . It seems now he 's sharing his office with someone else . And I traced the call from Mr. Lee to that new line . And just whose new line might that be , as if I didn 't know ? - Brigitte . - Well , why did I even ask ? Hold on , she 's not there . I , uh - [ Clears Throat ] L-I just intercepted another call between her and Mr. Lee . She just left in a limo . Mr. Lee 's limo . They 're goin 'to getJarod . [ Mr. Lee ] We 're going to getJarod now . - So , tell me how you found him . - Simple . - [ Typing ] - By interviewing people whose lives Jarod has touched ... I 've been able to understand how he thinks . And more importantly , how he feels . We were able to break the code - the pattern ofhis behavior . Jarod has a need to defend those abused by power . Because of this need , he 's drawn to predictable situations . - Such as ? - Those that are related ... to the trauma of his childhood , and the guilt he feels over the abuse of his work . Anna has extensively researched potential scenarios ... that would attract him . We 've successfully isolated the one that will lead us to him . It 's a shame my future stepchildren won 't be there to share the moment . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Giggles ] - You 're deliciously naughty . [ Laughs ] - [ Giggling ] Why , thank you , Mr. Lee . A blind Chinese guy , a bimbo and a limousine - how hard can that be to find ? [ Slams Down Receiver ] Two and a half years we 've been chasing Jarod ... and that bitch is gonna bring him in . Lyle , are you all right ? You look terrible . - You ought to see the other guy . - Bad hair day ? I was abducted by ... several of Lee 's men . They obviously got the best of me , but I ... put a whole lot of hurtin' on ' em in the process . Lee questioned me for hours , but finally gave up . Had his enforcers drop me off in the middle of nowhere . [ Clucks Tongue ] Oh . Well , you can thank Bridget ... - for your quality time with Lee . - Brigitte ? - [ Affirmative Grunt ] - He 's working for her . Yeah . She 's gonna bring Jarod in . Well , not if we get there first . I 've triangulated the signal from Brigitte 's cell phone . And this should lead us right to Brigitte and to Mr. Lee . Oh , and they 'll lead us right toJarod . [ Laughs ] - [ Chattering ] - [ Beeping ] [ Computerized Voice ] Thank you , Jarod . You 're welcome . Abner gets to come home where he should have been all the time . How can we ever repay you for all you have done for us ? - This is repayment enough . - Oh . Good luck , Abner . [ Brigitte ] Ironic place to find Jarod . A genius at a facility for the mentally challenged . Yes , Jarod has discovered that many of the residents ... have been intentionally misdiagnosed . The director keeps them here in order to defraud their insurance ... and their parents . They 're trapped - prisoners in an institution that denies them their freedom . And Jarod 's here to liberate them . How noble . - Wait . - [ Helicopter Approaching ] No . No , no , no , no ! I don 't believe this ! - What the hell are you doing here ? - Good to see you too . - Where is he ? - I 'm supposed to bring him in ! - Like hell you are . - Nobody 's cuttin ' me out of this , least of all you . Stop your arguing ! We must get toJarod now ! He 's gone . You have a gift for the obvious . He knew we were coming . He 's known all along . Intercepted your memo . - What memo ? - From Brigitte to Daddy ... requesting the unique services of Mr. Lee to catch Jarod . - He couldn 't have done this alone . - You blew it , angel . [ Mr. Lee ] Someone informed him of our presence . Anna . [ Helicopter Rotors Whirring ] Thank you for all of your help . After all the people you 've helped ... it was about time that someone helped you . What you did took a lot of courage . You bought me the time I needed . I 'd do it again in a heartbeat . I mean , what you did for my family and my nephew - I 'm the one who should be thanking you . - I hope someday we 'll meet again . - I hope so too .

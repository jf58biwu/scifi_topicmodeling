 Sorry I 'm late , but I have a very good excuse . Picture this : I 'm just getting ready to leave the Mess Hall when Ensign Wildman goes into labor . What else could I do but deliver the baby ? Oh , you should have been there , Harry . There is nothing like bringing a new life into the world . I think I missed my calling . What if I told you the turbolift got stuck on Deck 6 ? This is the third time you 've been late this week , Mr. Paris . It won 't happen again . Commander , I am picking up a distress call on one of the upper subspace bands . What 's the source ? A small spacecraft . No weapon systems . One life-form aboard . Extremely weak life signs . Slow to half impulse . According to the bioscanner , it 's a Vidiian female . Open a channel . No response . She may be too sick . Or maybe it 's some kind of trick . Preliminary scans show no other Vidiian ships in this sector . It is unlikely that this is a trap . Commander Chakotay , notify the Doctor . Mr. Kim , beam the woman to Sick Bay . Aye , Captain . Her renal organs are functioning at 20 percent of normal and her cardiovascular system is on the verge of collapse . 20 milligrams of lectrazine . Cardiovascular and renal systems are stabilizing , but her neural patterns are fading . What is it ? In her parietal lobe . It looks like some sort of implant . It 's a very complex web of bio-neural circuitry , nano-fibers . Could this be what 's causing the problem ? On the contrary . According to these readings , the device is actually storing her synaptic patterns , processing them and transmitting neuro-electrical impulses to the rest of her systems . Are you saying it 's some kind of artificial brain ? No . I 'd say it 's more like a neuro-cortical stimulator designed to supplement the higher brain functions . But it 's not working anymore . From what I can tell , the implant itself is functioning , but it 's connected to mostly dead nerve cells . If we don 't do something quickly , she 'll be brain dead in a matter of minutes . What about trying to stimulate cell regeneration with a high dosage of inaprovaline ? Very impressive , Kes , but I think it 's too late for that . Get me a high-frequency RF transmitter . You 're going to have to hurry , Kes . The patient 's brain function is diminishing rapidly . Now ... set the delta band frequency of the holo-emitter to 8.6 tetrahertz . What are we doing , exactly ? Transferring the patient 's synaptic patterns into the holo-buffer before they degrade completely . Is there enough storage capacity in the holo-matrix for such complex data patterns ? There 's enough capacity for my program , isn 't there ? And my program contains over 50 million gigaquads of data , which , I don 't have to tell you , is considerably more than the most highly-developed humanoid brains . What good is preserving her synaptic patterns if there is no body ? I 'm creating a holographic body . Not only will we be able to communicate with the patient , but we 'll have an accurate model of healthy Vidiian physiology that will aid in treating her actual body . Computer , project the patient 's skeletal structure . Now add internal organs . Add musculature . Now apply epidermal layers . Computer , use transporter records to recreate the patient 's clothing . According to her ship 's navigational logs , the woman was en route to a remote Vidiian colony . Are we anywhere near it ? It 's about ten light-years away . We should be in the general vicinity in about 22 days . Assuming she survives and we can take adequate security precautions , we 'll turn her over to her people when we get there . Captain . Is there something wrong ? I wanted to talk to you about Lieutenant Paris . His attitude lately 's been less than professional . I 've noticed . I know crew discipline 's my responsibility , but , in this case , I thought I should let you get involved before I took any action . In a way , Paris has been your personal reclamation project . I appreciate your bringing this to my attention , Commander , but I trust you to handle the problem any way you see fit . Chief Medical Officer 's Log , supplemental . Test results indicate that the holographic body is functioning normally . The patient 's synaptic patterns appear to be stable , so I 'm now ready to begin transferring her cognitive and motor processes . Who are you ? I 'm the Chief Medical Officer of the Federation Starship Voyager . We received your distress call and brought you aboard . What have you done to me ? It 's quite simple really . I used the undamaged chromosomes in your cerebellum to recreate your original DNA code , and then programmed the computer to project a holographic template based on that genome . Holographic ? A three-dimensional projection of light and energy . See for yourself . Your neural patterns were degrading rapidly . It was too late to expect results from inaprovaline , so I was forced to improvise , not that it would have occurred to just any physician . Why are you crying ? I 'm sorry . I ... I thought you 'd be pleased . I am . I just never expected to look healthy again . I 've been sick for so long . I 'll need a complete medical history . How long have you been ill exactly ? I was first diagnosed with the phage when I was seven . And when did you begin receiving replacement tissue ? About that same time . At first , it was hard to get used to the changes , but it happened so often that after a while , I almost stopped noticing . l-I never ... I never thought I 'd see myself again . Thank you . This is the most extraordinary thing anyone has ever done for me . I wouldn 't be too grateful . There are serious limitations to being a hologram . First of all , we can only exist within environments equipped with holo-emitters , such as this Sick Bay . You mean , you 're ... I 'm this ship 's emergency medical holographic program . You 're a computer simulation ? An incredibly sophisticated computer simulation . I 'm sorry . What did you say your name was ? I don 't have a name . It wasn 't part of my original program . However , you , I 'm sure , have one . Danara . Danara Pel . Well , Miss Pel , may I ask what someone with an illness like yours was doing alone in space with no access to medical care ? I was helping to treat an outbreak of the phage on Fina Prime . I was on my way back to my home colony , but it 's a long journey and my condition got worse . You 're a medical practitioner of some kind ? A hematologist . Well , then , perhaps , given your expertise , you can help me with your treatment . My treatment ? I feel fine . Unfortunately , that 's only temporary . Your synaptic patterns will eventually degrade if we don 't get them out of the pattern buffers and back into your brain . How long ? A few days . Perhaps a week . I see . Your real body is in stasis . As you can see , we have to find a way to repair your damaged neural tissue . Is something wrong ? It 's nothing . I 'm eager to discuss treatments . Of course . The procedure is quite simple . I 'll drill an opening into your skull precisely two millimeters in diameter , and then use a neuralyte probe to extract a sample of your parietal lobe weighing approximately one gram . It doesn 't sound simple to me . I still have nightmares about what those people did to me . And now you want to crack open my head , cut out a piece of my brain and give it to her ? Your experience in the Vidiian prison suggests Klingon DNA is resistant to the phage . Losing a small amount of neural tissue is inconsequential . Not to me , it isn 't . Yet that same tissue , grafted onto the patient 's brain and stimulated to grow , will significantly slow the spread of her infection . If we can increase the grafted tissue mass quickly enough , we can transfer her synaptic patterns back into her brain before they degrade in the holo-buffer . It won 't cure the phage , but it should prolong her life considerably . Please change into a surgical gown and lie down on bio-bed number one . I am not going ... Excuse me . I just want to say that ... I 've read about the experiments that were done on you . What you went through must have been very traumatic . That is an understatement . I 'm sure it is . Please understand , this disease has been killing my people for hundreds of years . Trying to stop it has become an obsession and many of our politicians and scientists have never developed compassion for the people who keep us alive . As much as I want to go on living , I have accepted the fact that I will die soon . I only want your help if you are willing to give it . Of course , I ... I 'd like to help you if I can . If you have any questions at all about the procedure , I 'd ... I 'd be happy to answer them for you . I 'll go and get changed . I 've finished ingrafting the Klingon neural tissue to your cerebral cortex . Now , all I have to do is create an axonal pathway between that tissue and your basal ganglia . Your technique is very impressive . It 's all part of my programming . For example , this exact procedure was developed by Dr. Leonard McCoy in the year 2253 . I 'm equipped with the collective medical knowledge of more than 3,000 cultures . Additionally , as you see here , my imaging system allows me to perform and , in many cases , improve upon the most delicate tactile maneuvers required by a dizzying array of surgical procedures . Incredible . It is , isn 't it ? Hand me the submicron suture , please . There . That should do it . Ah . Excellent work , Doctor . I was only assisting . Nonetheless , that assistance was invaluable . It could be two or three days before we 'll know if the graft will hold . In the meantime , perhaps I should deactivate your program temporarily . Do you have to ? It would slow the degradation of your synaptic patterns . But I have so much energy . I don 't know . Maybe it 's the excitement of the surgery , or ... or maybe it 's this new body . What I 'd really like to do is take a walk and see the rest of your ship . Unfortunately , that 's not possible . However , if you 're looking for something to do , please feel free to use my office to access our medical database . You 'll find several interesting texts on comparative endocrinology . All right . Thank you . On second thought , there is someplace else we could go . It 's wonderful . If I had a place like this to go to , I 'd be there every day . Don 't your people have recreational facilities ? Congregating in groups is strictly regulated . Congregating in groups is strictly regulated . It 's considered to be a threat to public health . A wise policy . I suppose . Sometimes , I think my people spend so much time trying to save lives , they don 't know how to live anymore . Doctor , aren 't you going to introduce me to your date ? She is not my date . She 's my patient . I 'm sorry . I didn 't realize ... Mr. Neelix , this is Dr. Danara Pel . As Chief Morale Officer , may I be the first to welcome you to Voyager . Madame , your loveliness illuminates our dark little cavern . May I have the pleasure of this next dance ? Go away immediately . Both of you . You 're disturbing my patient . You are just jealous because you cannot dance . Let 's go . You 're making the lady nervous . Nice to meet you . I apologize . No . They were just being nice . Irritating , isn 't it ? I guess I 'm just not used to ... so much attention . Where I come from , when you 're as sick as I am , people ... healthy people ... stay away from you . I guess ... I ... I forgot for a second that I don 't look like that anymore . It 's a natural response . All this talk about me . There 's still so much I 'd like to know about you . There 's not much to tell , really . My program was developed by Dr. Louis Zimmerman in a lab on Jupiter Station . I was activated on stardate 48308 . Since that time , I 've performed 347 medical exams , healed 1 1 compound fractures , performed three appendectomies and , in my greatest feat of medical prowess , I once cured Mr. Neelix of an acute case of the hiccups . You 're very funny . I am ? Well , several clinical studies have shown humor to be very therapeutic . Consider it part of your treatment . What is it ? It 's , uh ... just that I ... I haven 't laughed in a very long time . Thank you . What did that man mean when he said you can 't " dance " ? That 's dancing . And you can 't do it ? It 's not part of my programming . Oh . I see . Well , Dr. Pel ... Please , call me Danara . As you wish ... Danara . And what about you ? What should I call you ? Well , as I said ... I know . You don 't have a name . Would it be all right if I gave you one ? Well , I ... How about ... Shmullus ? Shmullus ? It was my uncle 's name . He used to make me laugh , too . Doctor ... Shmullus . I think I like the sound of that . Well ... here we are . Yes . Here we are . Danara , I think we should ... Yes ? Deactivate your program for at least eight hours . If you think it 's best . I do . All right , then . All right . Computer ... - Shmullus ? - Yes ? I had a wonderful time . I 'm pleased . Thank you ... for ... everything . Thank you for ... giving me a name . Uh ... well ... good night , Danara . Good night ... Shmullus . Computer , deactivate Vidiian program Alpha . Mind if I join you ? So how are things , Tom ? Excuse me ? How have you been feeling lately ? Is something bothering you ? Oh , no offense , Commander , but why the sudden concern for my feelings ? Well , you 've been moody lately , indifferent to your duties . To be honest , you don 't seem to be taking your job very seriously . If you 've got a problem , I 'd like to know what it is . Yeah , I 've got a problem . My problem is you . You care to elaborate ? You tell me I don 't take my job seriously , but half the time , you don 't let me do my job . What 's that supposed to mean ? It means that you don 't trust my judgment . You don 't allow me to take initiative . Remember last week ? I suggested that we might save time by traveling through that emissions nebula . But what did you say ? " Oh , no , that 's not the way we do things on this ship . " Look , sometimes I 'm not going to agree with your suggestions , but making decisions is part of being a leader . Maybe someday you 'll understand that . Being a leader also means knowing when to give your people a little leeway and let them be creative . We might as well put this ship on autopilot for all the freedom you give me to do my job . I didn 't come here for a lecture from you on how to do my job . Yeah , well , I know you don 't put much stock in my opinion , so maybe you should talk to some of these people . Because I 'm not the only one around here who 's got a problem with you . Now , if there 's nothing else ... sir ... I 'd like to be excused . Sure , Paris . You 're excused . Dissension among the Voyager crew . Maje Culluh will find that very interesting . Good work , Mr. Jonas . Now , there 's something else we 'd like you to do . We want you to create a small accident , which will damage Voyager 's warp coils . Why ? There 's no need to concern yourself with that . You just ... plan the accident . We 'll let you know exactly when we want it to happen . We 'll let you know exactly when we want it to happen . Do we understand each other ? I want to talk to Seska . I 'm afraid Maje Culluh ... You tell Maje Culluh that I won 't do anything to damage Voyager , and if he has a problem with that , tell him to have Seska contact me . Doctor , when you have a minute . I 'm running a level-2 self-diagnostic right now . I 'll be there as soon as I 'm finished . Why are you running a diagnostic ? I 've been experiencing periodic lapses in concentration and difficulty handling objects . There may be a malfunction in my tactile acuity subroutine . How long has this been going on ? About two or three days . Since Danara came aboard . What 's your point ? Maybe she 's the reason you 're feeling this way . I fail to see a connection . Maybe you 're attracted to her . I told you , my program 's malfunctioning . Romance is not a malfunction . Romance is not part of my programming . Your programming 's adaptive , isn 't it ? Yes . Then I 'd say it 's adapting . What if ... I don 't want it to adapt right now ? Why wouldn 't you ? Because I don 't like what 's happening to me . I 'm used to being in control of my faculties ... confident of my decisions . But lately ... whenever Danara 's program is deactivated and I should be concentrating on my work ... I find myself thinking of nothing but her . Why don 't you reactivate her ? Because whenever I do that , I suddenly feel ... unsettled ... unsure of myself , and I have no idea what to say . Why would people seek out situations which induce such unpleasant symptoms ? Because when the other person feels the same way you do , it 's the most wonderful thing in life . Suppose ... hypothetically of course ... Of course . I wanted to pursue that possibility . How would I proceed ? You 'd have to tell her how you feel . That 's it ? Just ... tell her how I feel ? Otherwise , you may never know how she feels . I 'm going to try stimulating your motor neurons . Well , the nucleus cuneatus appears to be functioning normally . And now for the anterior thalamic pathway . Excellent . By the way , Danara , I 've been meaning to tell you ... Yes ? I 'm romantically attracted to you and wanted to know if you felt the same way . Is something wrong ? No . I ... Did you understand what I said ? Yes . Well ? Doctor , maybe now isn 't the time to ... Excuse me , Kes . I was speaking to Danara . I think it 's best if we keep our relationship ... professional . Well ... I 'm going to ... try stimulating the posterior sciatic nerve . Doc , what brings you here ? Is somebody sick ? Actually , Mr. Paris , I was looking for you . Oh . Well , pull up a chair . Mr. Paris , I assume you 've had a great deal of experience being rejected by women . Oh , thanks a lot , Doc . What I 'd like to know is : What does one do to recover from the unpleasant symptoms of romantic rejection ? Why the sudden interest in romance ? I can 't tell you . It 's a matter of doctor / patient confidentiality . Ah . All right , well , let 's see . Sometimes there 's not a lot you can do to get over a woman you really care about . I remember when Susie Crabtree dumped me back in my first year at the Academy . I broke out in hives . Couldn 't get out of bed for a week . I almost failed Stellar Cartography . I walked around in a daze for the rest of that year . Of course , the first one is always the hardest to get over . I see . But ... eventually , you start thinking about her less and less , until finally , without realizing it , she 's not on your mind anymore . So the symptoms do subside over time ? For the most part . But every now and then , even years later , something reminds you of her ... a certain smell , a few notes of a song ... and suddenly you feel just as bad as the day she told you she never wanted to see you again . If you want to know the honest truth , Doc , you never completely get over a woman you really cared about . Wait a minute . Doc , we 're not talking about you , are we ? I told you , it was confidential . Oh , boy , you 've got it bad . Look , Doc , I don 't mean to intrude , but if you tell me what 's going on , maybe I can help . Hello , Kes . Are you feeling all right ? I 'm fine . I 'm just ... waiting for the Doctor . Oh . He 's been gone a long time . You really like him , don 't you ? Then ... why didn 't you tell him that you felt the same way when he told you that he was attracted to you ? I don 't know . It all happened so fast . He just blurted it out . He 's very blunt . You shouldn 't take it personally . How could he possibly have those kinds of feelings about me ? Maybe because you 're a compassionate person , a brilliant doctor , you appreciate his humor ... Should I go on ? Please don 't . One thing you 're not very good at is accepting a compliment . The next time someone has something nice to say about you maybe you should just take them at their word and feel good about yourself . It 's not easy to feel good about yourself when you 're used to living your life ... like that . Danara , I can 't pretend to know what your life 's been like , but I do know there 's nothing sadder than a missed opportunity . Maybe what you and the Doctor need is to spend some time together ... alone . It sounds to me like she might just be shy . I think you scared her off . I did ? Your approach is all wrong . Well , what would be the right approach ? Women like romance . They want men to make an effort ... take them someplace special . Where would I take her ? Come with me , Doc . I 've got an idea . Doctor 's Personal Log , Stardate 49504.3 . Inaugural entry . Kes and Mr. Paris have conspired to get Danara and me alone together in a place Paris considers romantic . I 've never felt more ... uneasy . I wasn 't sure you were coming . Neither was I. If you don 't want to be here ... No . I do . Where are we exactly ? On a planet called Mars . Inside a primitive land-based vehicle . It 's called a ' 57 Chevy . Mr. Paris is quite an automobile aficionado . This is his program . What is it that we 're supposed to be doing ? I believe it 's called ... parking . I almost forgot . These are for you . Thank you . You 're ... you 're very ... very thoughtful . My prayer ... I downloaded a new dancing subroutine into my program this morning . Would you like to get out and try it ? Actually ... I wouldn 't mind just ... sitting here for a while . You wouldn 't ? Those moons and star formations are so different from anything I 've ever seen before . Well , if you 're interested , I could point out a few astronomical highlights . You see that bluish planet there ... that 's called " Earth . " It 's where Starfleet Headquarters is located . With the world far away ... And over ... there that 's " Cygnus . " And there ... that constellation is called " Hercules , " named after a character in ancient Greek myth . Hippocrates was also a Greek . He was the father of ... Tonight ... Earth medicine . While our heart are aglow ... And that cluster over there ... that 's ... called the " Pleiades . " Oh , tell me the words that I 'm longing to know My prayer And the answer you give May they still be the same For as long as we live That you 'll always be there ... Sorry I 'm late . That 's all right , Mr. Paris . We don 't need you . Mr. Grimes has taken your place at conn . But it 's my shift . Not today it isn 't . What , because I was ten minutes late ? That 's right . Captain ... Don 't look at me , Mr. Paris . Commander Chakotay has complete discretion in this matter . So , when should I report back for duty ? When you decide to start taking your job seriously , we 'll discuss it . But right now , you 're dismissed . Get your hands off me ! Mr. Tuvok . Yes , Captain . Please escort Mr. Paris to the brig . Oh , boy , am I glad to see you . I wasn 't even sure if they were giving you my messages . I 've gotten them all , Mike . You 've been very helpful . Do you know what they 're asking me to do ? You mean about the warp coils ? I was thinking you could do it by forcing the magnetic constrictors out of alignment . Look , Seska , I don 't mind feeding you information , but if you 're planning some kind of attack ... I have no intention of raising my child on a Kazon ship ! One way or another , I 'm going to take Voyager . You can either help me or you can suffer along with Janeway and the others . Don 't worry , Mike . Everything 's been planned to the letter . Here 's how it 's going to work . We 'll be waiting for you on a planet called Hemikek IV . Doctor 's Personal Log , Stardate 49507.2 . The more time I spend with Danara , the more my programming continues to adapt . I look forward to perfecting my romantic skills once we 've completed the synaptic transfer . Set the delta band frequency of the holo-emitter to seven terahertz . Seven terahertz . Wait a minute . Did you administer the cervaline as I instructed ? 500 milligrams every four hours . I don 't understand it . What 's wrong ? The brain ... your brain ... it 's rejecting the graft . We can 't go through with the transfer . I 'm detecting elevated levels of nytoxinol . Where could that have come from ? Is it possible you made an error ? Administered nytoxinol instead of cervaline ? No , I don 't think so . But here 's the hypospray I used . Check for yourself . You 're correct . It 's cervaline . Has anyone else been in Sick Bay during the last 24 hours other than you and Danara ? Crewman Foster came in for some analgesic and Ensign Wildman was here for her regular prenatal visit . Why ? Because , if the nytoxinol was not administered by accident , I can only conclude that someone is deliberately trying to kill Danara . Who would want to kill her ? Perhaps someone who bears ill will toward Vidiians . Whoever it is , I intend to find out . I 'm calling Lieutenant Tuvok . Please don 't do that . We have to find out who 's trying to obstruct your recovery . I administered the nytoxinol . Didn 't you know it would kill you ? You mean kill her . She is you . Was me . I don 't ever want to be her again . What are you doing ? Looking for the cervaline . I have to reduce the rate of tissue rejection before it 's too late . Kes , would you excuse us ? I don 't want to go through with the transfer . If we don 't get your neural patterns out of the holo-buffer , you 'll be brain dead in a matter of days . I can 't let that happen . I 'd rather live two more days like this with you than go on for who knows how long , wasting away a piece at a time . It 's my duty to keep you alive . I thought you were more than my doctor . I thought you were my friend . I am your friend . What kind of friend would ask me to go on living like this ? And for what ? So that I can go back to a world where everyone I ever loved has died , where almost everyone I meet is going to die ? You 're a doctor . You can help them . I can 't help them . I can 't cure them . All I can do is prolong their suffering ... just like you want to do to me now . Danara ... I have no desire to see you suffer . Do you know what it 's like ? Do you ? No , but ... What it 's like to be a nine-year-old child and suddenly your best friend doesn 't want to come to your house anymore . And when you ask your mother why ... " Why won 't Mala come and play with me anymore ? " And she tells you it 's because ... it 's because the other children are afraid of you . Listen to me . Before I met you , I was just a disease . But now , everything 's different . When people look at me , they don 't see a disease anymore . They see a woman , a woman you made , a woman you love , a woman you 're not afraid to touch . Danara , I was never afraid to touch you . Why ? Because you 're a doctor ? Because I love you . You say that now , but if I go through with the transfer ... If you go through with the transfer ... ? I will be sick again ... and ugly . Danara , you 're not ugly . You 're simply ill . Please , stop patronizing me ! I know how people see me . Danara , do you think if you go back into your own body , I 'll feel different about you ? Won 't you ? Listen to me . Nothing could ever change the way I feel about you ... not a few scars , not some diseased skin , nothing . You have given me the most extraordinary gift that anyone has ever given me . You brought me to this ship where no one is sick , and people are friendly . You 've made me healthy and beautiful . I don 't want to go back to the way things were . You said , before you knew me , that you were just a disease . Well , before you , I was just a projection of photons held together by force fields , a computerized physician doing a job , doing it exceptionally well , of course , but still , it was ... just a profession , not a life . But now that you 're here , and my programming has adapted , I 'm not just working anymore . I 'm living , learning what it means ... to be with someone , to love someone . I don 't think I can go back to the way things were either . Danara , please ... don 't die . I want us to be together . So do I. But if you put me back into that body , I 'll have to go home ... and help my people . I know . But we 'd still have two weeks together before we reached your colony . Danara , please , be with me for as long as you can . Computer , play music program Doctor-alpha .

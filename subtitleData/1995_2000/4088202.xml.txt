 - You in charge here ? - Lieutenant Kraskow . Is the Bureau taking over ? You 're welcome to any help that I can give you , but that 's not why I 'm here . What can you tell me ? Silent alarm tripped 30 minutes ago . We think there 's one robber , armed . Probably a handgun . Definitely no pro or he would have been long gone . A single gunshot about 20 minutes ago . Blinds are down but we think we 've got a body on the floor . - But you 're not here to take over ? - Two of my agents might be in there . Skinner ! Skinner ! Hold it right here . - Do I know you ? - Stop this . Don 't let this happen ! You 're in charge here , you know . It doesn 't have to end like this . Yeah , it does . Son of a ... Damn it ! Yes ... Yes . Monday , 7 : 16 AM . Hello ? It 's coming through down there ? ... It 's my damn waterbed . My damn waterbed sprung a leak . I-I-I know I 'm not supposed to have a waterbed ... I don 't know what to tell you ... I-I think it was a gift ... All right . - I know . I missed the meeting . - You didn 't miss the meeting . You 're extraordinarily late for the meeting . It 's still going on . - What are you doing down here ? - We took a short break and I came looking for you . - What are you doing down here , Mulder ? - I 'm having the best damn day of my life . Any moment I 'm about to burst into song - - " Zip a dee doo dah . " My , uh , waterbed sprung a leak and shorted out my alarm clock . My cell phone got wet and crapped out on me and the check I wrote my landlord to cover the , uh , damages is going to bounce if I don 't deposit my pay . - You ever have one of those days , Scully ? - Since I 've been working here ? Yeah . When did you get a waterbed , Mulder ? Bank 's just down the street . I 'll be back in ten . Cover for me , will you ? When do I not ? - Jerk ! - Yeah ? You want some ? We good ? - Pam ? - Go run your errand already . Yeah . I just got to go pick something up . No biggie . Right , Bernard . No biggie . I 'll be ten minutes . Wait here for me . - Hey , man , you need to watch it next time ! - You watch it ! Right on schedule . Poor guy . You never did that before . " This is a robbery " Now , that 's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year . Um , other D.O.J. projections estimate a larger , uh , two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate versus the , uh , one to one and a half percent cited in the earlier , uh , Tanner study . However , there is some dispute that the , uh , statistical methodology in this latter study is not the D.O.J. preferred methodology . In any case added variables make crime trends for the coming year particularly hard to predict . The unpredictable future . Which brings us to Agent Mulder . Will he or will he not grace us with his report ? May I help the next in line , please ? I 've got ... a few transactions . " This is a robbery . Put the money in the bag . No alarms . " Customers , face down ! You know what this is ! - Oh , God . - You ! On the floor ! - Oh , God , don 't shoot us ! - Shut up ! You 're the boss . It 's all right . All right , I 'm the boss ! No silent alarms , no dye packs . Do it like the insurance company taught you . Start with the counter money . Quicker you go , quicker I go . Everybody else out here on the floor . Ahh ! Leave the last one . No tricks . All right , come on . Come on , come on , come on ! Zip a dee doo dah . All right , get your keys . Come around here . We 're going to open up the ATM . Hey , lock the doors ! You forgot to lock the front door . On the ground ! - Drop it ! Drop it now ! - You drop it ! You drop it . Travel expense reimbursement . Who 's got those figures ? All I 've got here is third and fourth quarter . No ? Assistant Director ? Go , go , go . Go , go , go ! Sir . - Who 's in charge here ? - I am . Unless the Bureau 's taking over . - Skinner ! - Hey , hold it ! Skinner ! Don 't let them charge in there . Skinner ! Do I know you ? Skinner ! They 're supposed to call , right ? They 're not going to call . - What 's your name ? - Yeah . Look , I got to call you something , right ? How about Steve ? It 's a nice ... honest name . Steve . Bernard . I have to get my partner out of here . I am blowing this whole freaking place right off the map if they come in here . Look , they don 't know that . Don 't you realize that ? They can 't see you . - They don 't know what your plan is . - They better know . They damn well better figure it out . Look ... just walk in front of the door and show them . You want to get me killed ! I just want everybody to live . That 's all . I just ... just show them . You have control over everything that happens here . You do . And it doesn 't have to end this way . Yeah , it does . Oh , son of a ... Son of a bitch . Monday , 7 : 14 AM . Oh ... that 's great . Yeah ? ... It 's coming through down there ? ... It 's my damn waterbed . It sprung a leak . Yeah , I know I 'm not supposed to have a waterbed . I don 't know what to tell you . I ... I ... I 'm sorry . I mean , I ... Who you calling ? Nobody . What do you mean , nobody ? It 's got to be somebody . It 's nobody you know , Bernard . Forget it . There 's something I got to do . I want you to come . I 'm not going with you . Look , I 'm not asking . Pam ? Don 't go getting all weird on me . It 'll only take a couple of minutes . Look , Bernard ... just go to work . It 's not too late . I 'm not going to work today . - And don 't say they 're going to fire me . - I wasn 't going to say that . 'Cause you know what ? Who cares ? Like there 's a big future in mopping floors . Like that 's something to lose . - We lose everything . - No , no . I got a plan . This time tomorrow , Pam ... Everything will be roses . Damn it . I know . I missed the meeting . Well , not yet , but , uh , only because it 's the longest in FBI history . - What are you doing down here , then ? - Well , I came looking for you . We took a five-minute break three minutes ago . Mulder , your cell phone 's not working . - Did you oversleep ? - Scully , did you ever have one of those days you wish you could rewind and start all over again from the beginning ? Yes . Frequently . But , I mean , who 's ... who 's to say that if you did rewind it and start over again that it wouldn 't end up exactly the same way ? So you think it 's all just fate ? We have no free will ? No , I think that we 're free to be the people that we are - - good , bad or indifferent . - I think that it 's our character that determines our fate . - And all the rest is just preordained ? I don 't buy that . There 's too many variables . Too many forks in the road . I meant to be on time to work this morning but my waterbed springs a leak flooding my apartment and the apartment below me so that makes me late for the meeting . And then I realize I got to write a check to cover the damages to my landlord but , as I 'm walking to work , I realize that that 's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay . So now I got to go to the bank , which makes me even later . Since when did you get a waterbed ? I might just as easily not have a waterbed then I 'd be on time for this meeting . You might just as easily have stayed in medicine and not gone into the FBI , and then we would never have met . - Fate . - Free will . With every choice , you change your fate . Then let 's change yours . I will deposit your check . You gather your files , go to Skinner 's office , give your report before he takes it out on both of us . " This is a holdup ... " I endorsed my damn check stub . Mulder ! Don 't go in the bank today . - Excuse me ? - Bernard 's in there . Please don 't go in the bank . - I 'm sorry . Do I know you ? - You pass me every day on the street . Every single day . This day , on your way to the bank . And then you go inside , and everybody gets killed , you , your partner , Bernard , everybody . - I pass you ... and then we die . - Yes . Over and over . Only ... only last time you looked at me , you looked at me like you knew me . Like you remembered . Please remember me . Don 't go . Drop your weapon ! Drop it . I ain 't dropping nothing . You put yours down . - I 'll shoot her ! - What do you think I 'll do then ? Bernard ... That 's your name , right ? Bernard , she 's not dead . You 're not a murderer yet . You can end this the right way . Sir , please . Listen to them . Don 't hurt anybody else . A whole lot of police are coming . You tripped the alarm . Yeah , I know . Yeah , I know . I-I know already . I 'll pay for it . Monday , 7 : 15 . The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not responding ... Agent Scully ... Yes ? - Please don 't go inside the bank today . - The bank ? Cradock Marine , Eighth Street branch a block from here . I 'm not following . Did-did you get separated from your tour ? I 'm here to see you . I 'm begging you ... please don 't go this time . Don 't let Mulder go , either . - Um ... I 'm sorry ... - Excuse me , miss ? You 're not supposed to be in this area . If you walk in that bank , you 'll die . Both of you . - Did I miss the meeting ? - Huh ? No . No , we , uh , took a five-minute break about , uh , three minutes ago . Uh , Mulder , your cell phone 's not working . - Wow , that is so strange . - What ? I just got the weirdest sensation of déjà vu . I 've been having it all morning . - Well , that 's fairly common . - Yeah , but never to this degree . I mean , I woke up , I opened my eyes , I was soaking wet ... It 's a long story but I had the distinct sensation that I had lived that moment before . Well , you may have . Did you do a lot of drinking in college ? - I wonder what it means . - Mulder , I don 't see why it has to mean anything . Well , you know , some Freudians believe the déjà vu phenomenon to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious . That it represents a desire to , uh , have a second chance to set things right . - Set what kind of things right ? - Whatever 's wrong . Mulder , it 's more likely that we 're talking about simple neurochemistry ... A glitch in the brain 's ability to process recognition and memory . - Doesn 't mean that the memory 's authentic . - Yeah ? Well , but what if it were ? What if you 'd lived this moment before and now you 're living it again ? Yeah - - so that I could right some wrong or change fate . Well , right now I 'd say you 're fated to go to this meeting . No . Actually , I 'm fated to go to the bank . Mulder ... what bank ? - Cradock . Right down the street . - Eighth Street . What ? Some ... some woman just stopped me in the hallway not ten minutes ago . She knew both of our names and she warned against either of us entering into the Cradock branch on Eighth Street . She said that we 'd die . What did she look like ? Five-eight , thin , green eyes , dyed hair . M-maybe you know her . Maybe ... it 's just somebody pulling a prank . I 'll use the ATM machine . I don 't want to tempt fate . All right , our next order of business is federal crime projections . Who 's got those figures ? Uh , right here . Um , if you all could just bear with me one second . Uh , " federal crime projections " . TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE Do you remember me ? You match a description . You 're the , uh ... You 're the woman that gave a warning to my partner , aren 't you ? Uh ... Have we met ? More times than I can count . Right here on this sidewalk . Usually , you walk right by . You 'll pass a few minutes earlier , a few minutes later - - little details , they change . But it always ends the same . What always ends the same ? I keep having this conversation . We go inside the bank ... and we all die . That 's what you told my partner . Is ... is something going to happen inside the bank ? Is there going to be a robbery ? Every time I tell you there 's going to be a robbery you run in there to try to stop it and that 's when things go bad . Don 't you see ? We 're all in Hell . I 'm the only one who knows it . Something went very wrong on this day the first time around . Something got screwed up . Things didn 't end the way they were supposed to . Now it 's like a needle stuck in a groove . - You 're saying this day repeats over and over again . - Until we get it right . Till my boyfriend doesn 't blow up that bank . I have tried everything to stop him . I 've hid his keys , I 've drugged his coffee ... I even called the police on him myself . He always gets here . He 's meant to . It 's you . It 's you and your partner every time . If it wasn 't for you , nobody would die . If what you 're saying is true , how come I don 't remember it ? How come you 're the only one ? - That 's got to be 50 times you 've asked me that . - 51 . What 's the answer ? I don 't know . I just do . Be glad you don 't . Please ... you can stop this . You 're the variable . It has to be you . I have tried everyone else . All I 'm asking is just walk away . That 's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year . Other D.O.J .. projections estimate a larger two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate , uh versus the , uh , one to one and a half percent cited in the earlier Tanner study . - However , there is some dispute that ... - Um , excuse me , uh ... Agent Arnold . - Um , where 's Scully ? - She just left , Mulder . I assume to look for you . Uh , excuse me . Everybody , face down ! You know what this is ! Give me the money . Oh , God ! Oh , God ... You ! On the floor ! Oh , God , you 're going to shoot us ? Oh , God he 's going to ... - Shut up ! - He 's going to shoot us ! Please don 't kill us ! - Please don 't do this ! - Shut up ! Give me the money ! - Don 't shoot us ! Don 't shoot us ! - Damn it , shut up ! Hey ! Hey ! Get your hands up where I can see them ! Do it ! Do it now ! Drop your weapon ! He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . Monday , 7 : 15 AM . I know , I know . I missed the meeting . You didn 't miss the meeting . You 're extraordinarily late for the meeting . The bank 's just down the street . Cover for me , will you ? We good , Pam ? - Pam ? ! - I know ... you just got to go pick something up . No biggie . What is with you ? Why are you always in a mood ? 'Cause nothing ever changes . Things are going to change . You wait and see . I 'll be ten minutes . Wait here for me . - Hey , man , you need to watch it next time ! - You watch it ! Do I know you ? - Do you ? - Yeah , you just look really familiar to me . - Do I ? - Yeah . No ? Uh , all right . I 'm-I 'm sorry to bother you . May I help the next in line , please ? ... He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . ... estimate a larger two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate , uh , versus the one to one and a half percent cited in the earlier Tanner study . However , there 's some dispute that the statistical methodology in this latter study is not the D.O.J. preferred methodology . In any case , added variables make crime trends for the coming year ... Excuse me . Agent Scully ? Excuse me . It 's Agent Mulder , and he said it 's urgent . - Mulder , where are you ? - I 'm at the bank . Yeah , I know where you are , but what 's taking so long ? Scully , I need you to do something for me right now . - Ma 'am , will you come with me ? - Why ? - Just come with me , please . - What 's this about ? My partner said you 'd know . " This is a robbery . Put the money in the bag . No alarm . No tricks . " Take it . I 'm a federal agent . I don 't want us all to die in here . What are you talking about ? You 've got a girlfriend outside in the car and you 've got a bomb . Something very bad is going to happen here today and I want you to know that I 'm not going to let it happen . But if you walk out that door right now ? I 'm not going to stop you . You 're in charge here , Bernard . - You 're damn right . - You could change your fate . Everybody down ! Now ! You know what this is ! - No ! Oh , God ! - Get down ! If you don 't believe me , ask her . - Drop it ! - Get away from her , Pam . - This isn 't gonna work . You can 't be in here . - Drop it now ! - You drop it . - Listen to me , Bernard ... - You get her out of here ! - You get her out of here . You 're dooming her by doing this . You 're making her live this day over and over again , her , you , me , all of us . What the hell are you talking about ? Every day you die in here and every day it starts all over again . - You can 't want this for her . It 's Hell ! - Hell ? I 'm doing this for her . Listen to him , Bernard . Put your damn gun down ! Put your gun down , Scully . Trust me , it 's the only way to get out of here . You got to put your gun down and let them out . He 's got a bomb . Come on , Bernard . Let 's go . - You son of a bitch ! - No ! This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI ... This never happened before . - Yeah ? - Mulder , it 's me . Tuesday , 7 : 17 . I 'm late again , aren 't I , Scully ? No , not yet but Skinner wants to see us in his office as soon as possible . He 's asking for our report on the robbery yesterday . I 'll be there in an hour . - I 'd like to hear it , too . - Well , you were there , Scully . That 's not what I mean . You still won 't explain what happened yesterday ... How you knew that Bernard Oates was strapped with explosives . Call it a feeling . And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice waiting in the car ? I don 't think she was an accomplice . I think she was just trying to get away . Are you okay ? I 'll be there in an hour . " Woman Dies in Robbery Attempt " " Police Officer Named Hero "

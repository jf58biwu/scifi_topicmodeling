The first wave Translation and adaptation Grizzly ( c ) thin Catrenul 23 century III . " The two sides will meet death in a dream treated nightmare hidden enemy . Barriers protecting false dreams , and kill the spirit blade . Prescott , Maine Today is buried Rachel Cates after he died mysteriously in his sleep . After Eddie 's research , it was one of the few famous mediums living here . Normally , I hotlines and call center , they which were mentioned medium . But after seeing I wonder if Gua decided that this group is a threat that no longer afford to ignore . I 'm not psychic , but I have a strong feeling I 'll meet an alien . Spare me . There have even less respect ? - It 's a rhetorical question ? - Ellen , let him go . Quinn will care only when it is his funeral . Always a pleasure to see you , Molly . - Do not mind . - What ? Sunt Stanley Lawrence ... - From insurance company in Maine . - I need this . Rachel Cates had insurance from us . Are investigator . - What does that have to do with me ? - Maybe I rÄƒspunde £ POA a few questions . - Your name is ... ? - Why ? My name is George , but I do not see what difference does . George Sedowsky ? You 're one of Prescott 's mediums . He told Ellen that ? I will not talk about it . I heard you and Rachel have studied in the same college . And , what if ? Is that a crime ? George , the only reason 'm here , is that Rachel 's death occurred in an unusual way . Bleeding in the brain is a natural cause of death . Not for a person of 24 years . - The medical record was clean . - I am not a doctor . - Does not it seem strange her death ? - I do not know . - Maybe I should put these questions . - Maybe you should talk to Ellen . Mind guy ? - You take the George , I get you . - It 's okay . I finished talking . Rachel 's death was a great shock for our group . I 'm sure it was . What did you study at university all ? We have the best paranormal research group in the world . I did not mind that reading can be learned at school . Not everyone can do that , Mr. Stanley . Each of us has different skills that ... We try to improve through training . Learn from each other . Molly became a strong owner telekinetic power . George is endowed with the ability hypnotic projection . Projection hypnotic ? You can see things that are not there . And what you can do , Ellen ? I am clairvoyant . I see things by touch . You suffered a great loss , but did you stronger . You set off on a dangerous mission . I feel doubt ... Sadness . You pursued . I can almost see them . I did not know that insurance companies are so interesting . Now that ability . The way Rachel died does not make sense . What do you think happened ? Rachel had a strong mind . He was very talented . Sometimes there is intense competition in our group . - You think it was a crime ? - Rachel was killed . According to the report , investigators discovered heavy bleeding in the brain . It is considered a natural cause of death . Mr. Stanley , you ever heard of telepathy in the dream ? No . Telepathy in dreams ... it 's a very rare and powerful ability . With it , an environment can enter the dreams of others . To enter someone 's dream , then scares the person in the dream ? That 's right . The mind perceives death in the same way , whether you are awake or in a dream . Who has the ability that could do this ? Quinn was the most talented student until he left the group . If you could produce such a telepathy , I think it could be deadly . - Very good shot , pal . - Want another chance to lose ? What would bet everything you have against me ? I 'll sleep on the street after that . I like you , kid . The game is my life . I 'll go get a beer . One beer please . It seems that the guy is playing pool like swimming with sharks . Let me tell you a secret . I do not play billiards . I stick it in the hole . Break them . Beautiful . Your Aunt Milly will not like that , boy . - Sometimes you have to learn some lessons . - Hit . 8 ball in the corner . No need to hurry . Sometimes you have to learn some lessons .. - Hey , I 'll teach you something mind ! - Sir , is there a problem here ? No . - You 're not a cop . - And you 're wrong to billiards . Well , to cheat the pool is not related to honesty . Besides , Ellen sent you here to talk about Rachel , so why would you not longer . Have you studied at university for 3 years and have given up . What keeps you here in Prescott ? I evaluate options . I feel that you are not the most popular guy on here . You know , Ellen 's silly . I have nothing to do with Rachel 's murder . How do you know she was murdered ? There must be medium to realize that . People my age do not die that way . Ellen seems to think that you can use telepathy in the dream . Really ? Not until I 'm not so good . Besides , you know , that I understand quite well with Rachel . - Then why are you showing everyone the finger ? - Because I was fired . Where to ? From the program ? Why ? I do not know . Do not have trusted me . What was so important that you had to give out ? Man , I was not there to bend spoons ! Think academy really cares about people like us ? No , I was funded by the government . What were the means for the government ? I have to go . Enough said . - Quinn , who killed Rachel ? - I told you I have no idea . Do not say that . You can read minds , so do not lie to me . Get away , right ? Because I do not owe anyone anything . You know , I think you want to talk to Molly Simon . Because I can not really tell what she 's thinking . Perhaps it is alien . I 'll be right , Mr. Stanley . Let me guess , you 've seen the future and you know who 's coming . No , Ellen called me and told me that they could come over . That 's right . You telekinetic ... I prefer to say " moving and shaking " . You know , Ellen mentioned how beautiful you are . - Unfortunately , I did not come to socialize . - Not just about business ? I came in the hope that you will answer a few questions about the death of Rachel . I know nothing . Can you tell me what you were doing at the university ? I thought I 'd talk about Rachel . I think her death is related to the program . - I 'm not willing to be involved . - Why ? Please , sit down . It hurts neck to look up . Can you tell me something about the program ? Only if you touched tea . You 're avoiding the question ? Do not be rude , Mr. Stanley . Ask me anything . Investigating the murder of Rachel . What I hide ? I do not like to talk about it . What is the connection , Molly ? Why Rachel died ? Reach . You annoy people with questions like that . Let me get up . According to Stanley , I think you got me wrong foot . We planned a more fun afternoon . - I 'm sorry I let you down . - It could be fun . I killed Rachel , but beware , because the one who did it might come after you . Foster is amazing . A telekinetic uses pressure to move objects . These watches are resistant to a depth of 90 meters . That 's pressure is 64 kg per 2.5 cm . What a woman ! - How long will that take ? - Relax . We must find government agency that funds environments . It will take some time . Not exactly the same as written in the book . What have we here ? Dude , I had to go back so many doors that I 'm not sure where I am . We arrived . Welcome to SETI . Search for alien life . They searched aliens . I would say that the situation becomes a little clearer . It must have been very close to that Gua noticing . - So , aliens have infiltrated ? - I think someone in the group is alien . Come on , Foster , how someone like Quinn , not realize that 's an alien among them ? Perhaps alien learned psychic abilities and use them to hide . And then use telepathy dream to commit a crime ... That 's a damn good alien . So who is it ? - That 's all university records ? - Yes , that 's all I have . If you want to know my opinion , I think it 's Quinn . Maybe he has skills , was fired . Perhaps it is a document that made him gone . Maybe Quinn suspected that someone would be fired . Here . Not Disciplinary Report for illegal behavior . GS archives ... You think it 's George Sedowsky , Foster ? Foster ? You will not succeed this time , George . Get out . Slowly . Nice of you to join . Friend , I reached level 8 . I want to know what you learned about SETI project . How did you hear about this ? Are intelligence . Someone did not like the work they do . There 's no way . SETI project has brought credibility to everyone . - I helped him out credibility to Quinn ? - Forget about Quinn . He 's a loser . Come on , it 's my best score . We put SETI look aliens ? How long until tomorrow insurance company is interested in aliens ? From the moment someone killed him while Rachel looks . And now you are the head of my list of suspects . I used her skills in order to explore the universe ... - Consider meteorites and radio . - What did you find ? They were called " direct complex marked with radio waves . " ... Transmission of extraterrestrial origin . Did you find aliens . Do you have proof ? It was a fire . All data about the aliens were destroyed . You thought it was caused by Quinn ? That day I looked in his eyes . I swear I felt ... That I could read minds . I knew he had caused the fire . - Did you find aliens ? - I think I 'm close to him . - Do you think I could be ? - You were kicked out because ... - You burned SETI lab . - I did . Then who ? I do not care but I came across an opportunity idiots to tell him off . So anyone causing a fire , and you 're out , and Rachel dies . All happened in a bad time ? You know , if I was an alien ... you 'd be dead already . Make it better to get into your head , Cade Foster . You know , I could call the police right now . - Do this and more will die . - As a crusader ! You can read minds like an open book . And the only reason for talking loudly now , is that you can watch what you say . You know about the existence of aliens , why do not you do something ? - Tell that to someone else , man . - You have a gift . You can detect aliens . You could stop this right now . - It is not my fight . - If you do not do something , one day will be yours , whether you wanted it or not . - Why not tell the others Quinn ? - I told them ! I told Ellen all about aliens . Not about the universe , but those who are with us . Want to hear what I said ? He told me to keep my mouth . Please , sit down , Mr. Stanley . No need for hostility . You lied . I know about SETI . You had evidence of aliens . Quinn told about it right here , and you told him to shut up . - I did the right thing . - Why ? Quinn started serious research . I could not afford to destroy our project with this tabloid full of fantasies . - Rachel died for a reason . - It was an excellent student ... - And a vital part of the team . - Do not tell me what all know Ellen . This has nothing to do with insurance . - Who are you ? - Does not matter . All that matters is that I came to catch a killer . Stop lying to me . - I saw how he died . - Rachel was alone when he died in his sleep . No , I mean she was killed due to a dream telepathy . I was there . The top drawer is a photograph . Rachel gave me picture a week before she was killed . The night she was killed I touched photography I had a vision and incredibly powerful . You saw her dream and seen telepathy in which he died ? He ran through the cemetery . He stepped into his own grave and fell into the abyss forever . - What do you see now ? - It 's too much , I can not do . Ellen , the killers will not stop at Rachel , if you will help me . What do you see ? It is very strange . I see ... Rachel ... Why did you bring me here ? I saw Rachel died , I know he 's dead . It is possible that this is a hypnotic projection of George ? I think it 's possible but why would he do that ? - Divert investigation . - Do not want to be in her room . - I feel terrible here . - Ellen , please . You have to walk through this room and tell me what you feel . I do not think George or someone else killed Rachel . Quinn is one that you should talk . Then prove it to me . Tell me what you see . Weird . It 's not clear . - I feel nothing . - Continue . Wait ... I see Rachel combing it . She looks happy . Talk on the phone . E angry . They quarrel with anyone in this room recently . Who are fighting ? I do not know . I can not say . Sorry . It 's too difficult . - Why do you have problems ? - I can not explain . Something I see my block . Can we go ? Be my guest . We leave , wait a minute . Foster , where are you ? - In front of Molly . - Molly ? - I thought George is our guy . - I think so , but Molly knows ... - More than tell . - Well , as with eyes open When approaching an alien , possessing mental power ... - Surely you know that you are there . - I know . What else have you got ? Well , I think Ellen is right when it comes to the dream telepathy . How so ? I came across some information on death sleep with something in mind . You 'll love this ... In 1972 CIA made experiments bioenergetic healing by binding night ... Alpha rhythms between humans during REM sleep . In short , Eddie . Killers sleep Foster . Connect dreams . Introduction agents ... - The people 's dreams to kill them . - Almost like a dream telepathy . Bingo ! But almost worked but then turned against them . That is , the agencies have started to die strokes and heart attacks . The sleep state has become so dangerous for agents and their victims . Therefore , joining the dream telepathy could be some kind of connection with reality . What hurts one , hurts everyone . The mind is a powerful thing , my friend . - That 's the answer . - What ? Nostradamus quatrain says that " the Spirit kill a normal blade " Perhaps the murderer can hurt both in reality and in dream . This means that you should ... You fight with the aliens in the dream telepathy . Maybe . In any case , Foster . I lost half a day looking quatrains . I am extremely ambiguous . What do you mean ? Listen , fighting an alien in his telepathy is too risky . You do not know what will happen . Calm down . I will make a move before talking to you . - Okay . - Go , Eddie . Talk to you later . - Change your mind , Mr. Stanley ? - Can I sit next to you ? It 's a start . Do not know why , but I get hot . - You make me curious . - I can be the answer to all your dreams . Why not tell me what you looked at Rachel the night she was killed ? We found Rachel 's watch . Glass is broken just like my watch . - Want to buy a new one ? - Molly , the clock stopped at 10 : 23 p.m .. Rachel died in less than an hour from that moment . Explain this to me . We argued , pushed me and I pushed her back . It was nothing . He was alive when I left . - Why did you fight ? - You may have heard that the laboratory burned . - Rachel did not believe that Quinn . - Who did it ? - Quinn the fire . - How do you know ? There was a time when Quinn and I were very close . He became a villain when he wanted to become the best . Rachel joined the group and began to challenge . Quinn felt threatened by it . - That 's laboratory burned . - Who did Rachel suspected that ... It would be the fire lab ? - George . - De ce on ? - She said that bad . - It was just a guess ? No , said he has proof . But I never saw her again . Next thing I know is that he died . Why did not you tell the police that ? I have not seen any evidence I do not want to be the next target for no reason . Molly , why should I believe you have not killed you Rachel ? If I did , I would have stayed in the bar to drink coffee ? I can not sleep for two days . Hey , Quinn ! Hi ! Normal supposed to scare me when a suspect for murder ... I grabbed his arm , but you have a beautiful smile . I think I know who the killer . - Forgot ? I do not care . - George of the fire . What are you going to do , hunter aliens ? We hope that I can rely on your skills . If you turn your back on me , you 're a coward . Thank you so much for letting me clear this thing . Do not ever call me what should I do with my skills . I should have let the guy make you dust . Not my day , man . You are a hypocrite . I know that your decisions are questioned . I 'm not the only one who thinks that the human species is not disgusting ? Can I stop the alien , Quinn . But I need your help . I said I can not create the dream telepathy . Can not or will not ? Or you need a good reason to do this ? George ? - Do not move ! Keep your hands up ! - What the hell is going on here ? - Who are you ? - George Sedowsky . What are you doing in my apartment ? I received an anonymous call . Receive an anonymous call and break my door ? We were told that there is a violent disturbance . Looks like it was an upset here ? I played only one game . I 'm sorry , sir . You know , you should see a document of yours . Of course . I think I left my wallet in the gym bag at the gym . Look . He was dead when I got here . Turn around ! And put your hands behind your head ! - I did not kill him . - Or how about ... - Someone framed ! - Shut the hell up ! I thought you did not wallet . What is the name of our killer ? It has a license from an insurance company named Lawrence Stanley . Look , posing as a cop . Dude , you 're in deep shit . Dylan Chase , redactor la revista " Independant Bikers " - There are many others . - Listen , whoever you are ... Anyone ... - Hey buddy , are you hungry ? - Yes . - Sorry to have bothered you , sir . - Apologies . - George is dead , Eddie , like Rachel . - But we thought that George was ... - It was a mistake . - So who 's the alien ? Quinn ? I do not think so . I think I just pulled me out of trouble . I have a feeling that Quinn will pass on our side . Where are Ellen and Molly . I feel something strange to Ellen . Can I send all the time ... - In the wrong direction . - This I becomes increasingly unclear . What does the quatrain ? What are we missing ? We extracted four rows of computer and tried to find meaning . Who knows what the hell does that mean ? The third verse is interesting . - " Barriers protect false dreams . " - Telepathy in a dream , it means it 's false . - Yes , a false dream . - Wait , Eddie . I have one thing to check . - Foster , where were you ? - I dug grave of Rachel . I was not sure . I 'm so tired , Eddie . Have some coffee ? Of course , my friend . What have you discovered ? Rachel 's coffin was empty . There they buried Rachel , because Rachel is not dead . Rachel este Cave ? I bet that aliens have realized that people with psychic abilities are able to discover . Rachel sent as a spy to learn mental skills program and to destroy them . Then he faked his own death to a pretty strong alibi . - Dude , you probably will come after you now . - Certainly . Here , take this . Thanks , buddy . Do not let me fall asleep , Eddie . Foster , I 'd love to help you , but ... Dar this ? You already asleep . Where are you , Rachel ? Telepathy is shared dream to reality , Rachel . What I hurts me , hurts and you . Gua waited for this for a long time . Grave digging is just for you , Foster . Just like a human being . Do not know when to quit . Let me write the monument . It is enough , Rachel - It 's over . - You got the wrong dream , Quinn . - That 's right , is not it ? - Yes . Are you okay , Foster ? Works ? You are right , guys ? It worked . I did . - I was afraid you would not come . - Are you kidding ? Do not miss the party . - Hello . - Good . I came to say goodbye . Going ? We have not even given a date . - I 'm sure it 's my loss . - Hard to believe that Rachel was killer . As long as your group is a threat , you can expect more like it . Do not ever go near that much . When you saw Rachel last night on the porch , she really was ? He looked at us . He saw how close I was to the truth . Then you framed the George and reported to the police . - I 'm sure I saw death . - Used each of psychic abilities that you learned here to return against each other . And cut SETI program . - Take care of yourself in your trip . - I 'll have . - You have to go . There 's not much time . - Okay . Goodbye . Goodbye . Our choice is clear . Either fight or die . Quinn has finally realized their responsibilities in this war . He found the courage to reach their potential . I am grateful for it . Quinn realize now what I learned from fighting Gua . Indifference will seal our fate , our actions we will ensure victory . All you have to do is to make a decision . Translation and adaptation Grizzly ( c ) thin

 Hell of an old satellite . Gravity well caught it before it could get into deep space . So it 's going nowhere fast . Heintz , how 's the satellite look ? I think the recorder 's the only thing worth grabbing . Or do you want the whole sat ? No room in the hold . I 'm gonna ice it . Roger . Pulling out . This is the Corona . This is the Corona . Station 103 , come in . Station 103 here . Go ahead , Corona . Final assignment completed . Obstacle drifting on course . PZ-302 has been destroyed . Now returning to station 103 . Station 103 , roger . Oh , can you swing through course " N " on your way back here ? Course " N " ? That 's not our area . Some mining asteroids have drifted loose over there . But the salvage ship covering that area 's had some trouble . You guys are the closest ones to them . Come on , Ivanov . Just this once ? That 's a no can do . We 're tired . Hell , the Corona 's tired too . Not even for overtime , Ivanov ? Sorry , you 'll have to find someone else . Oh well then . Have a safe return . I 'll give you the rendezvous point in a bit . Roger . Goddamned execs ! Like we 're a bunch of errand boys or something . All we ever get are the crap jobs ! What else should you expect when you 're a garbage collector ? You dumb shit ! They used to say that " A pile of garbage is a pile of treasure ! " Like if we got just one wrecked space ship ... we could build big houses in California , right ? Sure , if you can find a wrecked ship nowadays . Good work ! Heintz , tell Aoshima about wrecks . Aoshima . If you want to see a wreck , there 's one right there . Ah , sweet memories . I 'll be back soon , Cecile . Be a good girl and wait a little longer , okay ? Cecile ... Wait , there 's Katherine to think of too . What should I do ? Guess I 'll have to choose one . That sound ! And out he slides ! That stuff comes with the job and where we 're stuck . But it 'll be over soon . Well , I feel sorry for any girls who get hooked by that jerk . Damn right . Hey , Heintz , you have a daughter , don 't you ? But she 's still only about ten , right ? Gimme a break ! I don 't go after ' em that young ! All set . Emergency signal ? Aoshima , can you trace it ? The hell ? Hold it , Aoshima . Is this some kind of joke ? Madame Butterfly . Is this really an S.O.S ? Well , it is on the emergency channel . Oh , man , why do we have to volunteer to help people ... after we bust our humps all day ? Let the rescue guys handle it ! Idiot ! Don 't you know international maritime regs ? If we don 't , we 'll never be allowed on another ship . Aoshima , do you have the position ? Hold on . Area R ... Z ... 3 ... 0 ... 05 ? ! See , I knew it ! We 're shit out of luck . It 's in Sargasso . The graveyard of space . I thought only old guys get called out there . The magnetic field in that area 's pretty nasty . And this piece of shit computer isn 't anti-mag coated ! It 's like going in naked . You can 't break what 's already broken . Well , I don 't wanna see a double wreck . Right , boss ? Changing course ! Jesus . We could have a hundred houses in California ! That 's if we could bring them back . Boss , the mag field 's kicking up . There it goes ! Switch over to the backup computer . I don 't like where this is all headed . How about you , Heintz ? Aoshima , do you have an exact fix on the signal ? Boss ! Look at this ! What the hell ? It 's huge ! Practically an asteroid ! Looks like it 's made out of debris . Aoshima , can you track the signal ? Yeah , but I 'm getting some static burst now and then . Is anyone really alive in this thing ? We 're going to try to dock . Guide us in . Wait ! They 're generating centrifugal gravity , so ... Somebody must be living in there . Just pray they 're not pirates . Look ! There ! Right ! Is this the entrance ? I hope they don 't suddenly blow us away . Okay , try knocking on the door . All right , Heintz , record the entrance proof now . Show me your I.D. Okay , start . I , Heintz Beckner , and my partner Miguel Costrela ... acting on a mayday signal from this vessel in area RZ-3005 ... are about to enter to provide rescue assistance . October 12 , 2092 . October 12 , 2092 . Okay , you 're clear . All set over here . Damn , this equipment 's ancient . I guess that 's how we can get in so easily . Oxygen ? Air seems fresh . Radiation ... in the green . How 's the magnetic field looking ? Stable now , but you can never tell . Get back here in three hours . Roger ! It 's easy to command from a place like that . Miguel , are you all right ? Escort to the bottom of hell , huh ? Here comes the gravity ! My blood 's settling ! You should take more calcium ! Miguel , move it ! Can 't get up ! It 's okay . Just pop it off ! So , do we get the lady or the tiger ? We 'll find out when we get inside . What the hell ? Incredible ! Hey ... Wait ! Can you see this , Pops ? Yeah , it 's like a dream . More like a nightmare ! Hello ? Anybody here ? Let 's go ! It 's too quiet . Aoshima , you still getting that S.O.S ? Yeah , but it seems weaker than before . The magnetic field ? I don 't think so . Miguel , look ! What a babe ! The owner ? I hope so . The brave Sir Miguel comes to save Sleeping Beauty . Not bad at all . What 's wrong ? Someone ... Hey , Miguel ! A person ! I saw a woman ! What ? What the hell 's your problem ? Never seen a hologram before ? So , you really saw a woman ? Yeah , well ... She sorta blew away with the wind . That 's what you get for chasing that kind of girl . Shut up ! Save the playtime for when we get back . Heintz , behind you ! Oku-sama means " wife " , but can also mean " madam " or " lady of the house " . Oku-sama , luncheon is now served . Oku-sama , luncheon is now served . What ? What did it say ? " Oku-sama " ? This looks great ! Aoshima , can you see this ? Hey , Miguel ! Are you nuts ? ! It 's our privilege . Right , Heintz ? Who 'd have thought we 'd find real wine way the hell out here ? But why is it just set for one person ? " Oku-sama " lives by herself , apparently . I guess so . Want some too , Heintz ? You 'll get sick . Nice vintage . Excellent bouquet . Hey , Miguel ! Get real ! You wanna die ? ! Ah , give it a rest . Here 's to you , " Oku-sama . " Serves you right . You should be glad you 're still alive . This one ! And this one too ! Everything 's fake ! Hey , Pops , don 't tell me I have to knock on every one . Relax . Just walk forward . The S.O.S. Signal 's about 70 meters ahead . Okay . I hope that isn 't another fake too ! What 's wrong , Heintz ? Aw , man , you broke it . It might be worth something too . Nice smell ! This must be Oku-sama 's dressing room . Damn , it fell apart . Aoshima , you see this ? Yeah , it 's the same woman as in the portrait . That jerk doesn 't deserve her . Maybe she 's an actress . What do you think , Heintz ? A hologram ? Is that her ? Yeah . She 's the owner of all these trophies . Or should I say the owner of this place , if she 's still alive . " Eva Friedel , who sings evermore . July 3 , 2031 . " Aoshima , can you pull up some data on her ? " Best Soloist , Italian Dance Festival . " " Grand Prize , Vienna Music Awards . " " Tokyo International Opera Festival Golden Prize . " So , our Oku-sama is an opera singer , huh ? Living alone with all her past glories . No wonder she has so many dresses . Even if they are all fake . So , the S.O.S. was ... She was probably lonely ! Talk about your annoying women ! Your Tosca today was excellent , Eva ! Especially that duet . I can 't think of anyone else for that role . Who 's there ? ! Of course , because my partner was Carlo . Isn 't that right ? Oku-sama . Did you see it , Aoshima ? See what ? Hey , cut the crap ! She was just here . It 's ... not a hologram ! What 's going on here ? Flowers ... I mean , the woman ! I saw Oku-sama . Aoshima , what 's wrong ? I didn 't see anything . Maybe it was a ghost . Goddamn it , is everyone trying to screw with me ? " To my dearest Eva , from your Carlo , June 15 , 2005 . " Eva ? Hey , Miguel , you just met someone from the last century ? She may have used Cold Sleep . Search the other rooms ! She was here ! I 'm sure ghosts wouldn 't send an S.O.S. Stop humoring me ! Okay , Miguel , we 're running out of time . We 'd better split up . You 're not scared of ghosts , are you ? No way ! Bastard ! Think you can make a monkey out of me ? Aoshima , how 's that S.O.S ? Wait a sec . It ... It looks like it 's moving . Moving ? Then it must be a survivor . Probably . Great ! At least our visit won 't be wasted . What the ... ? Don 't scare me ! Who 'd make a woman cry ? Sheesh ! This place too ! A real cut-rate job . Maybe they ran out of money ? I don 't think so . Find out something ? Our Eva Oku-sama was born to nobility . A little princess , huh ? Well , that explains the hideous decor . She was famous as a genius soprano since she was little . They called her " the diva of the century . " She fell in love with a star tenor , Carlo Rambaldi . I 'm so happy to be with Carlo all the time . So , why 's our princess staying in a place like this ... with all those fakes ? Their relationship didn 't last long . She apparently lost her voice . Even so , she still played for Carlo on the stage . No one would understand her feelings . They started criticizing her pretty badly . No one may judge me but myself . The world no longer revolved around her . What happened to Carlo ? Right before they were married , he ... Died , right ? Bingo ! Murdered , to be precise . Murdered ? By who ? They think it was some crazy fan of Eva 's . But the guy who did it was never found . After that , she disappeared from public . And came here to live with her memories . It 's a real tragedy . Sounds like my type of woman ! What 's wrong ? The magnetic field 's kicking up . Hey , did you hear that ? Better get out of there . I 'm pulling the plug on this rescue . Roger . Miguel ! Didn 't you hear me ? Get back here ! I think I 'm lost . All I see is scrap metal . Are you really living here , Oku-sama ? What happened , Miguel ? Is it the signal source ? How should I know ? Where have I ... That song . Miguel , what 's that sound ? Can you hear this ? It 's the song ! The S.O.S ! I love you , Carlo ! Miguel ! What 's happened ? ! Miguel ! Hey , Miguel ! What 's going on there ? I heard a woman 's voice . Hey , do you read me ? ! Miguel ! Who are you ? Hey , you 're ... You 've gotten bigger , Emily . Papa , you always say the same thing . Can I open it here ? What 's inside ? Wow ! A space suit ! I wanted one ! Now can I go into space with you too ? Sure you can . Really ? Thank you , Papa ! Whoa there . I love you so much , Papa ! Oh yeah , Papa . The rocket 's broken . Oh-ho . Well , your papa is a rocket specialist . Mama , did you hear ? Papa said he can take me up into space ! Emily , we can talk after we eat . But ... That 's important to you , isn 't it ? You 'll get it dirty . But he can take me to space . Right , Papa ? Emily , don 't bother your father . But I wanna be with Papa all the time ! That 's true , Emily . We 'd like him to be home all the time . Right , dear ? Mama , can I have the jam ? Emily , you didn 't eat your cucumbers again . But I don 't like them . If you don 't eat it all , you can 't go to space . That 's not true ! I meant it ... when I say we never want you to leave ... my darling . Heintz , do you read me ? Come in ! What is it ? What 's wrong ? What 's going on ? Emily . Heintz , do you read ? Yeah , I 'm all right . What do you mean , you 're all right ? We 've been trying to raise you for 30 minutes ! What 's going on over there ? What 's with those dolls ? I don 't know either . Just get ready to move out . Shit ! Is Miguel okay ? You tell me ! This mag field 's a bitch ! Drop everything and get out of there . My thoughts exactly ! The mag level 's going through the roof ! What did you do over there ? Boss , this looks bad ! What 's wrong , Eva ? I 'm afraid that you are leaving me . Shit ! What the hell is he talking about ? He 's been acting like that for a while . Do you see Eva ? Heintz ! No , but I see angels . I 'll always be with you , Eva . Really ? Yes ! Forever , with you alone ! Shit ! That goddamn wreck of a guy ! I 'm so happy , Carlo . Eva , my life is yours alone . I love you . Thank you , Carlo . I don 't know who needs to send an S.O.S. here ! Miguel ! Where are you , Miguel ? Miguel . Come to me , Eva . As long as these roses bloom , we ... Miguel . Shit ! He 's fallen for it ! Miguel , come back ! Miguel ! Miguel ! What 's happening ? Heintz , come in ! Heintz , do you read ? Boss , look ! Christ , it 's eating the pod . The thing 's a regular gourmet . Shit ! What is it ? What 's wrong ? The debris ... Jesus , and the Corona 's being dragged into that thing too ! Son of a ... Heintz , do you read ? Miguel ! Miguel ! Don 't go ! Son of a bitch ! Miguel , this isn 't real ! Don 't you see , Miguel ? ! This is all just her memories ! Miguel ! Why do you interfere ? Carlo lives forever . With me , in my memories . What ? You of all people know what I mean . The hell with all this ! Why can 't you accept reality ? Carlo is dead ! I 've made my Carlo eternal . You what ? In my memories , he will never change his mind . You killed him , didn 't you ? ! But what appeal does that really hold ? Don 't you understand ? Allow me to show you something . This is ... Papa ! Look ! Now I can go into space with you . No , Emily ! Papa . Stay back ! Papa ! Papa , welcome back ! Did you bring me a present ? I 've been a good girl , waiting so long ! Emily ! Thank God , you 're alive . Papa , you 're squishing me . I 'm sorry , Emily . Welcome home , my darling . Papa , come on . Hey . Come on , let 's go inside . Come on ! Come on ! Okay , calm down . I can be with you forever and ever . Emily ! Emily is right here . Emily . Emily . Memories ... Memories ... aren 't an escape ! Aoshima , can we fire the analyzer cannon ? Sure , any time . What ? ! Wait ! They 're still inside ! If we don 't , we 'll all be dead ! Aoshima ! Aim at the central air lock ! Give me the location on screen . The computer . It 's gone mad ! Welcome home , my darling . Damn it ! We 're even gonna die surrounded by garbage ! Isn 't that just what we wanted ? ! Just hold on . Heintz , forgive me ! More of her victims ! Good morning , Eva . Good morning , Carlo . Ah , so beautiful today . You mean the roses ? Of course I mean you , Eva . They 've bloomed so nicely again this year . This is the season when they bloom their fullest . Every rose I see ... reminds me of you . Really ? You mean you don 't think about me all the time ? I always think about you .

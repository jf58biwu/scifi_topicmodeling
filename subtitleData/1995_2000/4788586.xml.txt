Do you remember anything about where you were taken before they locked you under the world ? I can 't remember . Time for medicine . Two more treatments . Maybe this will help you remember . We have to remember . For the boy . For the boy . Nothing on the mainframe about a safehouse . - Fenigor 's red files . - All seven . I found them in my father 's office . You stole those from Mr. Parker ? Is that a problem ? Not for you . Fenigor said the answers are in these files . That does ignite by code numbers only . Do you think one of these files could have something to do with Jarod ? What are you getting at ? No one knows how old Jarod is . And if your twin was taken to Nugenesis , do you think maybe Jarod could be your brother ? The answer is in Nugenesis . I want to see the boy . He is upstairs sleeping . You can see him on the monitor . Neuro-pathway stimulation in progress . And progressing smoothly . Should we get him back to the Center ? He can 't be moved yet . This treatment is predicated on a straight timetable . By morning he will be ready for transport . Where am I ? The ten digit number is under the expediter . They 're the same of all seven files . Try running ... ID number . Oh , man . What is it ? You were right , Syd . The number is identification code for the expediter who brought the children to the Center . And ? And you will not gonna believe who it is . Fenigor ? Fenigor ? Fenigor , wake up , man . I need to know about Prodigy . Red files . The children . Catherine , we could not save them .

What exactly are you doing with the boy ? Helping to prepare for his future . As what ? The pretender has the bloodline show the gift . I am helping to focus his potential . Like you did to Angelo ? Angelo was a mistake . Trial and error . With the new technology I 'll be able to focus the neuro stimulation to the parts of his brain I want to hyper develop . Is that what you did to create Jarod ? No , Jarod was a natural pretender . I 'm merely trying to recreate him . What was that ? Willie . - Where is it ? - Over there . Angelo crawled into the storm drain . Get the generator on now . Mr. Raines , power is out . Get back to the boy now . Jarod . How is he ? They hurt him like they did me . Like they did me . Tell me how long he has . Basically motor skills has diminished and he 's been unresponsive to external stimuli for hours . What did you see at the Angel Manor ? Neuro-receptors . That 's the very same process Raines used on Angelo . Well , there is one ray of hope . Angelo 's treatment seems to work . Is he with you ? Yes . And I 'm hoping the same treatment can be used on Davy . It could . But Raines 's new process would be much harder to reverse , if possible ... The brain is a non-forgiving area , Jarod . Time is against you . So you 're saying that if we don 't counteract Raines 's treatment , Davy 's degeneration could be irreversible . It will be . You have three hours or less to synthesize the new serum . I won 't let him do it again . Jarod , there is something else you should know . It 's about you , you and Miss Parker . " Inception " You think it 's true that Jarod is Miss Parker 's brother ? If Fenigor is right , the answer is under here . Well , maybe we would find blue box in the junk somewhere . Hello , nurse . Here it is , Syd . I got it . You know this is one blue ex cube I don 't know if I want to solve . Maybe if I don 't decrypt the information on it , I might even be able to sleep in nights . Syd . I found it . " Records Lab " How much longer ? Ten minutes . - Thank you for getting me in here . - Save it until I get you out . I know you can hear me . I 've been where you are , Davy . I 've been you . Jarod is going to make everything alright . Jarod 's gonna make it alright . You are sure that stuff 's gonna help that boy ? If he gets it in time .

But you have mine . " Dr. Jarod Spock " " Oakview 555-6507 " Hello , Oakview Lodge . It 's clear . Come on . Thank you for giving me a little piece of my past .

This is my chance to make it right . Go . For the boy . No . Damn it . Oh , man . All seven red files , plus the eighth , just like Fenigor said . Does it say if they are brother and sister ? Oh , you are not gonna believe what it says . Angelo . Angelo . I 've got it . It 's not the kid you need to worry about . Well , it 's good to see you again . Sis . How do you know I have a brother ? You 've got the red files too ? Mr. Fenigor was right about Prodigy . Our bloodlines and the lies the Center fed us . - What are you saying that you 're my ... - There were eight red files . Eight ? Each of these files represents one of the children the Center isolated as a potential pretender . There were seven children that your mother tried to save . But the secret to your past , is in the 8th file . The 8th child . You got my attention . Nugenesis monitored these eight children for the Center . They screened them . You see there is a special anomaly in our blood , in our genetics . They predisposes us with a gift . What is the big secret of number eight ? Number eight , it 's you . My blood was tested ? Yours and your ... twin brother who supposedly died at birth . Instead he was wasted off to Nugenesis . I 've narrowed your brother 's identity down to these two files . One of these belong to you ? No . I am not your brother . But one of these files does belong to him . Him ? And the other two of the boy named Bobby . But you know him better as , Mr. Lyle . So you are telling me , that my brother is either a psychotic killer or a mush head . It 's unmistakable . I need a drink . Big one . That him ? His name is Davy . Raines 's new pretender . As you can see , Raines already has a jump on it . Now Davy 's only hopeful recovery is an injection of serotonin . And if I don 't give it to him now , his condition becomes irreversible . No one 's doing anything until I figure out what the hell is going on . If you want to shoot me , then go ahead and do it . False bravado . Never cared for that in a man . Help us ! Your mum , may be my mum . died trying to save children like Davy . Do it for her . Do it . I heard shots . Are you alright ? Oh , god . What can we do ? Nothing . It 's over . No , it 's not . Angelo . That 's your last treatment . - Without it you ¡ ­ - He is a boy . Let him be a boy . Please . Sydney . This is more than I can take . Stolen kids , stillborn babies that aren 't , Miss Parker 's brother . Re-activating SL27 . It is my fault . I should have stopped this years ago . Come on , Sydney , what could you 've done ? I could have tried . Catherine Parker tried . Fenigor tried . She is dead and he soon will be . Now deader than I 'll feel inside if I don 't try out . What ? Syd , I mean what could you possibly do ? Syd , Syd . Wait a minute . That lady with the legs , she 's threw a wicked right hook . It 's difficult to distinguish between her bite and her bark . I read it so . Look at this . I found this dash away in my parents belongings . It 's a young one of you . I remember your dad taking it . It 's on the morning just like today . Do you know if I was their child ? or if I was adopted ? No . I just know they loved you . Very much . Where am I ? You are safe . Are you the substitute teacher ? Yeah . Yes , I am . Yes , I am . And you are going to be home . Soon . I like this song . Me too . Is it possible ? Maybe . I wish I could 've known you , the real you . I wish I could 've known the real you . Mum loved that song . She played it for me . Tell me about her . Well . They say she looked , Just like you . Yeah . Her smile made me feel safe . Her compassion , I can only dream of duplicating . She loved to read to me , take long walks with me . She loved me . And I loved her . I miss her everyday . You see her everyday . I know , you don 't have much time , but , do you remember something , anything that could tell me who killed her ? Who killed mum ? I know it 's there . Somewhere . I saw , I , I , watched . A man . What man ? What man ? Leave me alone . A man in a dark suit . Who ? I don 't know . Fenigor knows . Yes . But I hope you did too . She played it for you . I play it for you . That was beautiful . " Danger Explosives " I want a twenty-four-hour lockdown on all personnel for security checks and final test runs . No one in or out . Is that clear ? Raines . This is Gar . I am in Nugenesis . I know where they are . And , who is with them . Then work back in business . In twelve hours , I 'm putting you out of business . He is okay to travel now . We have to move . I can 't let you leave , Jarod , you know that . Is this what your mother would 've done ? It 's time to go home . Where are you taking me ? It doesn 't have to be this way .

It 's Jarod . - Mr. Raines , securities just reported a breach in SL27 . - What kind of breach ? Well , according to surveillance , it 's Jarod . Jarod is back . Jarod . It 's like another dead end . I know all I need to know . Do you ? Have all the deceit , and all the betrayal we both experienced , how do you know what the truth is ? Fenigor had no reason to lie .

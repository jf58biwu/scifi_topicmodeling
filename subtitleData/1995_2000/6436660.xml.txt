Oh , Gary would have loved this . Are you sure he 's going to be OK with those shrinking pills ? Well , as long as he doesn 't take more than two at a time , he 'll be fine . [ HIGH-PITCHED GIBBERISH ] Oh , we gotta try the Drag-o-Matic out on Chett , right ? [ ZAP-WHOOSH ] Huh ? Another water gun commando bites the dust . [ BELL RINGS ] We 'll discuss the terms of your surrender in my office . Ow ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Ah ! Oh ! Ooh ! What a rip . That tyrant gives me two weeks ' detention for possession of a squirty weapon . In fairness , the thing does shoot 8 terawatts of concentrated genie hoodoo . What happened ? I 'm ding hard time in detention hall unless I get some help here . So what , you want to be back on Scampi 's A list ? That wouldn 't suck . Easy enough . [ ZAP ] Another gun ? What 's this one do , bikini waxes ? It shoots buddy darts .

[ HEART BEAT PUMPING ] ( IN SLOW MOTION ) Surrender your weapon . No ! [ PEW ] [ ZAP ] Huh ? Good shot , pal . Hey , what do you say you and I hit the loading docks for a quick smoke ? Uh , uh , I- - I 'd like to , sir , but I don 't smoke . And you gave me detention , remember ? Detention ? Did I do that ? [ LAUGHS ] What a hard-ass I was . Hey , let me make it up to you . After all , we are best friends , aren 't we ? You like Armenian food ? [ BELL RINGS ] Smooth ride , huh ? I just had those bearings repacked . Nice action , sir . Hey , I just remembered . Uh , you have Mr. Pilate for Chem , right ? Yeah . Well , a little birdie tells me that you 've got a pop quiz on the periodic table tomorrow . Better study . Or don 't . I 'll just change the grades . Hm ? Huh ? What are those ? Pre-signed hall passes . Knock yourself out . Cool ! Oh , what to do ? I know . How would you like to make an announcement on your principal 's private PA system ? Wh- - what do I say ? Oh , wait , wait , wait ! I got one . [ FEEDBACK RINGS ] Attention , please . Would Paula Sparks please report to my pants ? [ LAUGHTER ] Good one ! Hey , you want to give each other nicknames ? Uh , sure ! What you got ? Well , you can call me Buzz , and I 'll call you Tex . No , uh , Rusty . Scooter ! [ BELL RINGS ] [ MUSIC - HARRY NILSSON , " BEST FRIEND " ] [ BUZZ ] PRINCIPAL SCAMPI : No student has ever seen what lies behind this door , Wyatt . WYATT : What is all this stuff ? PRINCIPAL SCAMPI : Confiscated contraband . 20 years worth of wrist rockets , Chinese handcuffs , and rubber dog poop . It 's all here . It 's , uh- - wow . And now I give it all to you . LISA : Look at all this loot . WYATT : Yep . Being buddies with Scampi 's paid off big-time . Oh , hey , look , a Game Boy ! Were we ever this young ? ELECTRONIC VOICE : Bite me . [ LAUGHS ] This is great . ELECTRONIC VOICE : Bite me . Bite me . [ LAUGHS ] Lise , it 's not that funny . ELECTRONIC VOICE : Bite me . CHETT : ( SHOUTING ) Wyatt ? ELECTRONIC VOICE : Bite me . [ ZAP-WHOOSH ] What the hell ? Is that a potty mouth key chain ? I love these things . ELECTRONIC VOICE : You 're stupid . Well , it 's not really a good one . That 's my butt hat . That 's yours ? Yeah ! I 'd recognize this butt anywhere . Ooh ! Still fits like a glove . Where the hell did you get my butt hat from ? This was taken away from me 10 long years ago by my old enemy , Assistant Principal Scampi . [ GIRLS TALKING ] CHETT : [ SNICKERING ] Butt-da-da-dum . Butt-butt , butt , butt , butt , butt , butt-butt , butt . Butt-butt , butt , butt , butt , butt , butt , butt- - oh . These butt-infested waters are safe again . I believe you know the way to detention hall ? Scampi . Scampi ruined everything . If you want to live , you 'll talk . Where 'd you get this ? Uh , Scampi 's office . He 's got this vault . The vault ? You 've seen the vault ? Think carefully , now . Did you see a Mr. T wig ? A what ? A Mr. T wig , pus baggie . Did you see a Mr. T wig ? Uh , yes ! Yes ! I- - I saw it , I saw it ! Thanks . Oh , that wig will be mine again , and I pity the fool who gets in my way . Huh ? Guys , you clearing out ? What 's going on ? Yeah , right . Hey , buddy . You like the surprise ? I 'm giving you this whole row of lockers . Spread your stuff out a little . Oh , hey , Wendy . You looking forward to the Primus concert ? That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . I 'm taking somebody else instead . Why ? What did I do ? Well , you 're Scampi 's little pal . It 's not exactly cool . I- - I 'm not his pal . ( SHOUTING ) Hey , Wyatt ! What do you say we build a tree fort this weekend ? We can use my contractor . Heh . Have fun at the concert . Hello , traitor . Harvey , what 's the deal ? Don 't play dumb , Donnelly . Someone from inside the Computer Club has been leaking access codes ? And you think it 's me ? Well , you 're the only one of us that gets a ride home from the principal . Consider yourself banned . Oh , and we 're deleting your erotic website password . [ ZAP-WHOOSH ] That was harsh . I guess being the principal 's buddy comes at a price . The price of being hated . How do I tell Scampi I don 't want to be his friend anymore ? Just be straight with him . He 's a grownup . He 'll get over it . What did I do ? What did I say ? Is it that I 'm not groovy ? Or because I 'm old ? The guy that just doesn 't know how to be hip or mod ? You 're a principal . I 'm a student . We weren 't cut out to be friends . It was stupid to try . I respect your feelings , Wyatt . I appreciate your candor . Well , I 'm glad you understand . I 'll see you around the school , huh ? Yes . Yes , of course . Will you need a hall pass ? Uh , actually , no . [ PATS POCKET ] Still got plenty . I 'm glad it all worked out OK . Well , he was a little upset at first , but I think he got the message . [ MUSIC - WAR , " WHY CAN 'T WE BE FRIENDS " ] Huh ? Oh ! What the- - I tried , Wyatt . I really did . But sitting through the Lakers game with your empty season seat mocking me- - there nobody left to have fun with . What about Mrs. Scampi ? Mrs. Scampi is the light of my life , and I love the woman . But she 's no substitute for a best buddy , someone to play Frisbee with ? Eee ! Please , don 't take it so hard . Maybe we could still be friends . Secret friends . Hm ? Top secret . Secret friends ? Uh , yeah , like President Clinton and Tom Arnold . They 're friends ? Nobody knows . See , we 'll still be pals , but nobody at school will have a clue . Secret friends . I understand . Oh , Wyatt ! Where is he ? Where is he ? Where is he ? Who ? Principal Scampi 's been missing all week . You 're his secretary . Why as me ? Don 't play dumb , brown-noser . Everybody knows you 're best friends . Now , he must have told you something . He told me that he caught you clapping erasers with Janitor Jim . Well , looky what we have here , the principal 's pet . And you know what we do to pets . We flea-dip ' em ! Unhand him ! Take that , young buck ! Principal Scampi ? No longer . Now I am a steadfast , devoted guardian angel working in the shadowy umber of night , protecting you from entities known- - and unknown . I am your Secret Friend . [ DRAMATIC LAUGH ] [ BELL RINGS ] Scampi 's flipped out . What the hell was in that dart ? Uh , well , you did ask him to be your secret friend . He 's flying around the school in a cape . What is he , my super secret friend ? Probably just a side effect from the buddy darts . Exactly how potent was that dart ? [ SPOOKY ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING ] [ FIRE CRACKLING ] [ SHIFTS TO UPBEAT ORGAN MUSIC ] [ SYNTHESIZER BEAT PLAYING ] [ SNAPPING ] This is serious , Lise . We 're gonna have to hunt him down to keep an eye on the poor guy till the spell wears off . Let 's split up . I 'll meet you back in his office in an hour . [ ZAP-WHOOSH ] [ MILITARY DRUM MUSIC PLAYING ] Farber High . Scampi 's vault is close . I can feel it , like a tingling sensation at the base of my spine . Wait , it 's moving . It 's spreading out . Oh ! That 's nice . No . No , he 's out sick today . Yes , I 'm sure . Look , if he were running around the high jump pit in an opera cape , I think I 'd know it . Excuse me , ma 'am . I need to evacuate you at once . Nerve gas . Big spill at the base . What base ? Top secret . Now move it , lady , before I have you shot . Move it , move it , move it ! [ HINGES CREAK ] Oh my god ! Oh ! Oh ! What 's this ? I didn 't do- - Principal Scampi ? I know not this Scampi of whom you speak . I am the Phantom . This is about those financial records . I swear- - Silence , stripling . It would bode well for you to reinstate Wyatt Donnelly 's erotic website password . Wyatt Donnelly ? He is under my protection . He is my Secret Friend . [ CAPE BILLOWS ] CHETT : No dope ! No drugs ! I ain 't flying , Murdock . I pity the fool ! I pity the fool ! I hate- - you . [ CAPE BILLOWS ] ( SCREAMING ) No ! [ ZAP-WHOOSH ] Ah- - any luck ? Any luck what ? Finding Scampi . Oh , yeah . I , uh , I 've been on it . Uh-huh ? It 's just that , uh , everywhere I 've looked , he hasn 't been . Uh , where exactly did you look ? What 's with the third degree ? You didn 't find him , either . You 're just jealous ' cause you don 't have ice cream . So what now ? I have an idea . When you do find him , you should shoot him with the antidote dart . The antidote dart ? Antidote dart . You know , the red one in your locker . We had an antidote dart the whole time ? My high school principal was serenading me with a boom box , and you didn 't mention the antidote dart ? Well , we , uh , can 't stand here all day flapping our gums . There 's a Phantom on the loose . [ ZAP-WHOOSH ] Huh ? What the- - argh ! [ SUSPENSEFUL ACTION MUSIC PLAYING ] Mmph ! Mmm-mmph ! Mmph ! And then after he stuffed the wig in my mouth , he started singing . It was horrible ! Wait ! Where did he go ? Down the hole . The hole ? [ SPOOKY ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING ] Huh ? [ HINGES CREAKING ] OK , Phantom , you got a date with a dart . Here , buddy , buddy , buddy . Here , buddy , buddy , buddy . [ CAPE BILLOWS ] [ GASP ] Greetings , my liege . You have found my secret world . From here I am able to attend to your well-being . It is a bit gloomy , but I find it facilitates my brooding . Principal Scampi , I 've come to take you back . You can 't live like this . Nonsense ! I dwell deep in the bowels of civilization . Culling strength from the putrid wind that I breathe , I thrive in the cold and the dark and the dank- - [ COUGHS ] [ POUNDING ON CHEST ] [ CONTINUES COUGHING ] [ SNIFF ] I 'm sorry , what was I saying ? You were thriving in the dank . Thank you . And it is in the dank that I belong . Trust me . This is for your own good . [ PEW ] Huh . Thank you . That was very helpful . Listen to me . It 's time to go back home- - back to your job , your family , your life . But who would look after you ? You need me to protect you . No , I don 't . How- - how can I make this clear ? Get out of my life and go back to yours . I 'm not your friend anymore . [ SIGH ] If this is true , then I have failed you . That leaves but one alternative . To go home . No ! To disappear forever , deep into the bowels of the underworld . Now you 're starting to scare me . I 'll lose myself in the maze-like network of the rat-infested sewers . I will live forever , trotting knee-deep in the raw sewage that runs beneath this wretched city , with the roaches as my brothers and the vermin as my supper . Ugh . Well , I 'm off ! [ CAPE BILLOWS ] No , wait ! Oh , ho , I need this dart . [ RETREATING FOOTSTEPS SPLASHING ] Just had to wear my good shoes today , didn 't I ? Ugh . You 've got to be kidding . [ WIND WHISTLING ] Oh . Scampi ! Hold up . Go back , Wyatt . This is a dangerous place . Be a pal . Don 't move . [ PEW ] [ ZAP ] Thanks again . Well , if that 's all , I think I 'll just be on my way . [ CAPE BILLOWS ] But- - oh , good . He made it to the sewers . [ SIGH ] I 'm gonna need this . [ WIND WHISTLING ] [ THUD ] Think something should go my way ? D 'oh . [ BRIDGE CREAKING ] [ SNAP ] Oh ! [ GRUNTING WITH EFFORT ] [ SNAP ] ( PANTING ) Oh ! Oh . [ SNAP ] Aaah ! Unh ! I see where this is going . [ CRASH ] Ow ! [ GRUNTING WITH EFFORT ] Hang tight , Secret Friend . Whoa ! Oh ! Gahh ! Jeez , what are you , nuts ? Sorry , chum . We phantoms pride ourselves on drama . [ SNAP ] - Aaah ! Unh ! [ CHUCKLES ] Like that , see ? Look , I know I haven 't appreciated everything you 've done for me . But I just gotta tell you , right at this second ? I think you 're one hell of a friend . Thank you . Oh , here . [ ZAP ] Huh ? Where am I ? What the- - [ GRUNTING WITH EFFORT ] Goodness lord , we 're gonna die ! You 're hurting my arm . Let go of me , boy . You 're too heavy . Let go of me . Let go ! Uh-oh ! [ ZAP ] Hang on , young friend . I 'd die before I 'd let you suffer harm . Thanks , pal . [ BOTH GRUNTING ] You sure you just don 't want to put an end to the spell ? Well , he did save my life . I can be his friend for 10 more minutes . Besides , look at how much fun he 's having . Push me , Wyatt ! I want to go higher ! Yeah-hah ! Yee-haw ! Hello , flight . Hello , dank underworld . Whoo ! [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different , we 're making weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , I do not know . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ]

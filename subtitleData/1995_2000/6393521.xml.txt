 You are doomed Doctor . Doomed ! You are piloting your TARDIS into a deadly trap and even you will not suspect until it 's far too late . You know , if you 're going to spy on me , you really should turn the speaker off . My dear Doctor , after our many centuries of conflict naturally I wished you to know that your certain death is now certain ! But even you will never suspect that your destruction awaits you on Planet Zaston IV . You only turned the picture off I 'm afraid , I can still hear you . I know that . Of course I know that . Curse you ! I wanted to talk to you anyway . I have some news that even my arch enemy needs to hear . Meet me on the Planet Terserus in two hours , relative time . And do try not to be late . Mock me while you may , Doctor . My revenge will be all the sweeter . And it will be a deadly vengeance . It will be the deadly vengeance of deadly revenge ! Where are we , Doctor ? The Planet Terserus , once home to the Terserons , the most kindly and peace-loving race I 've ever encountered . And yet the most shunned and abhorred species in all history . Why ? They could communicate only by precisely modulated gastric emission . Oh no . Planet of the bottom-burps ? So what happened to them ? They discovered fire . No doubt because no one has set foot on this planet for a hundred years , you thought you had escaped my traps of death . But you forget Doctor , I too have a TARDIS . When you told me to meet you at Castle Terserus , I simply travelled back in time a hundred years and I bribed the architect . Say hello to the spikes of doom ! Say hello to the sofa of reasonable comfort . Naturally I anticipated your journey back in time , and so I travelled slightly further back and bribed the architect first . Or so you think ! Naturally I anticipated your travelling back in time , so I travelled back in time to an even further point . And I bribed the architect first . Well , naturally I anticipated your journey back to an even earlier point ... Doctor , will you stop showing off . If you 've got something to tell the Master , just tell him . Very well . I recently calculated that I have saved every planet in the known universe a minimum of 27 times . But you know , I have grown weary of all the evil in the cosmos . All the cruelty , all the suffering all those endless gravel quarries . And so I have decided to retire , settle down and get married . What ? Yes . Without even knowing I was looking , I have found a woman to love , a woman more fascinating than all my travels through time and space , a girl more exciting than an escape up a ventilation shaft , a lover more thrilling than an army of cybernetic slugs . Sadly Doctor , I can not wish you a long and happy marriage because the moment I am done with this nauseating conversation I shall travel back in time once more and buy the architect an expensive dinner and suggest he puts a lever just here and a trapdoor leading to the vast and disgusting sewers of Terserus , exactly there ! Prepare for 500 miles of fear and faeces . Goodbye , forever , Mr and Mrs Doctor ! Since you appear to have fallen down a sewer you won 't be able to have dinner with the architect , although in fact he 's already eaten , because I had dinner with him and suggested he place a trapdoor right here . Careful , my dear . Not so fast ! How can he be here ? He just fell in the sewers . And why 's he so much older ? Because it 's taken me 312 years to climb out of those sewers . And naturally you found your TARDIS and travelled back in time to the present day , no doubt to wreak one of your terrible revenge things . Yes , but this time I did not come alone ! After three centuries of having gone through those sewers , only the Daleks would accompany me , because only the Daleks don 't have noses . So Doctor , we meet again . Yes . How are things ? Observe Doctor , I am no longer merely a Time Lord . My body has been augmented by superior Dalek technology . - So what can you do with that then ? - What ? You don 't know , do you ? Exterminate ! Exterminate ! Exterminate ! Stop ! No ! After 312 years of climbing through the biggest and most disgusting sewers in the cosmos , After three centuries of wading through those vast steamy lakes , climbing those huge squelchy mountains , After a lifetime of only dung slugs for food and the occasional company on those long , lonely nights ... After all that I 'm going to kill the Doctor myself , with my own bare hands ! Die Doctor , die ! Don 't worry , I believe he know 's the way out . 624 years in a sodding sewer ! This way ! - This way ! - Exterminate ! Exterminate ! After them you fools ! Get them ! 936 years in a sewer ... Wait for me ! Wait for me ! These corridors all look the same ! - We should be safe in here . Exterminate ! Exterminate ! So given that exterminating you would be the most sensible thing to do , why do they always change their minds at the last moment ? I 'll explain later . Behold ! Once again I have been augmented by superior Dalek technology , rejuvenating my physical form and granting me more power over the cosmos . And , I notice , breasts . They 're not breasts , OK ? They 're Dalek bumps . They can detect ion charged emissions , and operate as atheric beam locators at a distance of up to 20,000 light years . They 're also extremely firm . Are you trying to say ... ? Oh , nothing . Why are the Daleks helping you ? What are you giving them in return ? I have granted them secrets of the Zectronic Energy Beam . Oh no , you fool ! With the Zectronic Energy Beam the Daleks will be able to conquer the entire universe within minutes . With just a beam ? How ? I 'll explain later . Prepare to operate the Zectronic Beam in five Dalek minutes . I obey . You may conquer the universe , but you 'll have to share it with the beard and the bosoms over there . The Master will be exterminated when he has served his purpose . If the Master knew that the Daleks intend to kill him he might help us . How are you going to tell him without the Daleks hearing ? They 'll exterminate you on the spot if you say anything . I think we 've really had it this time . Don 't cancel our wedding yet , my darling , there 's just one thing you 've forgotten . What ? Daleks don 't have noses . Scraping the barrel a bit there , aren 't you ? Think , my dear . Back on Terserus the Master and I both bribed the castle architect . Not only do I speak perfect Terseran , but so does he . You mean .. ? Yes , I can communicate with the Master by carefully controlled breaking of wind . Could I be tied to a different chair ? Silence ! Why do you have chairs on a Dalek spaceship anyway ? We will explain later . Danger ? You are facing certain doob ... Certain doob ? Try not to clench ! The Daleks ... are planning ... to exterminate you ... as soon as you twiddley heepy jeepy . Sorry , that was me . Cease this communication ! You have betrayed the Daleks ! Exterminate ! Exterminate ! You fools ! This Zectronic Beam Controller will now not only explode , it will implode . We 're doomed . Prepare the Zectronic Beam ! It is beyond my ability . Only the Doctor can do it . Help him , he 's dying . Yes , my darling ? He er , he says " I love you " . Oh Doctor . You 've killed him ! I think not , my child . This is only his ninth body . He has many , many more . Behold , the miracle of the Time Lord ! Oh , sorry about that ! I thought I 'd just slip into something more comfortable . Result ? Cute , sexy and lick-the-mirror handsome . I remember you , don 't I ? And you still fear me , Doctor ? You 're the camp one . I 'm not camp . Oh yeah . Nice tits ! Bumps . I remember you lot , of course . - And , er , you 're my fiancée ? You remember me then ? How could I possibly forget the only time-travelling companion I 've ever had ? You 've had lots of companions . The only time-travelling companion I 've had . Oh right . It 's still me in here , Emma . These old hearts are still yours . Can you still love me in my new body ? Actually I don 't think I 'll have too much of a problem with that . Er , back to the TARDIS ? The Zectronic Beam Controller is going to explode ! Help us , Doctor , and your life will be spared . What better way to end my career than saving you metal gits ? Pop into the TARDIS , get a bottle of good champagne . When you come out we 'll start celebrating the beginning of our new life together . Great . I think in my new body I 'm going to be particually good at rewiring . Ooh , bugger . Doctor ? Ah . You 're my fiancée , aren 't you ? Oh dear . Seem to be a bit shy of girls now . All the problems of changing personas . So unpredictable . Doctor , look at me . Wait a minute . Oh dear , another girl . I 'm not a girl , Doctor , I 've told you before . These are Dalek bumps . They can locate therapeutic beam emissions and ... everything . So , er , you don 't want to try again , do you ? Yes , probably not a bad idea , actually . Shouldn 't be too much of a problem . Actually , I think the problems are probably located in this area . Oh dear , look at that . I 've gone and used up three whole bodies in just under a minute , and all because I forgot to unplug first . That really was terribly silly of me . Sorry about that , my dear , bit unfortunate . Oh , Doctor ! Oh , assistant ! Doctor ! Residual energy . I 'm a stupid ass . I should have realised . The Doctor has saved the Daleks . His life will be spared . No , his life is already lost . That was a discharge of pure Zectronic Energy . Even a Time Lord cannot survive its terrible power . But he can just change again . Can 't you , Doctor ? I 'm afraid not , my dear . Zectronic Energy ... too powerful . It has destroyed my ability to regenerate . I 'm afraid this is ... the end . Look after the universe for me ; I 've put a lot of work into it . But how can we look after it without you ? I 'll ... Explain ... Doctor , listen to me . You can 't die . You 're too ... You 're too nice . Too brave , too kind and far , far too silly . You 're like Father Christmas ! The Wizard of Oz ! Scooby Doo ! And I love you very much . And we all need you , and you simply cannot die ! He was the best and bravest of all my foes . From this day forward I will renounce evil , and follow the path of goodness , to honour my fallen foe . The Doctor saved the Daleks . The Daleks too will honour their mortal enemy . He was never cruel and never cowardly , and it 'll never be safe to be scared again . It 's impossible ! Beyond all known laws of the universe ! Maybe even the universe can 't bear to be without the Doctor . Emma , look , I 've got atheric beam locators . No Doctor , I 'm afraid those are actual breasts . Are you sure ? I think I can see the ' on ' switch . No , Doctor , we have to face facts . You 've come back to life , and this time you 're a woman . Really ? I 've always wanted to get my hands on one of these . Unfortunately , I haven 't . You 're mother 's going to get a bit of a surprise at the wedding , isn 't she ? Do you think we 'll both wear white ? I 'm afraid , Doctor , and I 'm not sure this sentence has ever been used so completely accurately before , but ... you 're just not the man I fell in love with . Well , never mind . We can still rattle around the universe , fighting monsters and saving planets . What could be more fun ? My best friend by my side , my trusty old TARDIS , and , of course ... ... my sonic screwdriver . Ooh look , it 's got three settings ! Doctor , stop that ! Doctor , I have to say you are rather gorgeous . I 'm not bad , am I ? And , come to think of it , you 're a great deal more attractive than I remember . Why , thank you . Tell me , why do they call you " the Master " ? I 'll explain later .

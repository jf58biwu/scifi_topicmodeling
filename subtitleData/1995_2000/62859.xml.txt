I have a little brother . cool ! What 's he like ? Trunks ... a sweet kid . - Tell me about your planet . a world called Konats . green with life and beautiful . Until the day an evil wizard released a demon upon us . We were attacked by Hildegarn . People were killed . Cities were leveled . Everything was in runs ! Death semmed inevitable . Then a miracle happened . Minoshiya ! Did you die in the midst of all that horror as well ? Trunks ! - Where are you off to ? you 're welcome to stay as long as you like ! It 's no intrusign ! Trunks couldn 't be happier to have you here ! but I can 't . - Why not ? The spirit of that monster is trapped inside my body ! explain it to me . So what exactly do you mean by " monster spirit " ? - Alright ! I 'll tell you the story of how my world was almost destroyed by this monster spirit ! they were granted great powers by their evil master . They used their black magis and brought the legendary evil of Hildegarn to life . - Those warlocks must have possessed incredible dark powers . and Hoi is one of them ! - That old man fooled all of us . But why is the monster 's spirit in your body ? - The warlocks were the only ones who could control them . Only my legendary flute and sword can keep it in check . - The warlocks were the only ones who could control them . Only my legendary flute and sword can keep it in check . - Your flute and sword ? - Yes . Weapons from the Gods themselves . a priest used the sword to split the monster in two - a top halt and a bottom half . Hildegran 's bottom halt was imprisoned in my body . His top half was imprisoned in my little brother 's . Please returned to the planet Konats . It was then that my brother and I became known as Great Heroes . Then how did you get trapped in the music box ? - The warlocks came after the two of us next . we agreed to be locked away in the music boxes ... forever . the greater the danger of the monster escaping . We were placed in pods and sent to different ends of the galaxy in the hopes that they wouldn 't find us . But Hoi wants the whole universe as his own ! That 's why he came looking for the music boxes ! - What about your brother ? - Most likely he 's been killed . - This is unforgivable ! the full horror of Hildegarn will be released again ! - Is that why for days at time your never sleep ? - Yes . - No problem ! Leave it to me ! - Ehh ? - How about I build something for you that acts like the music box to help to control the monster 's spirit ? - You can do that ? so I 'll give it a try ! please ! I 'm begging you ! - Alright then ! Wish me luck ! - Yes . - I 've finished it ! Meet me in Tapion 's bedroom ! - Really ? - It 's got the same configuration as the music box . - Go on in and take a look . You can rest at ease in here without worry ! - Thank you so much ! - This is not the full glory and might of Hildegarn ! - This is only the beginning of my great conquest of the galaxy ! - What was that ? - This is what it was all about then . - Big brother . What happened to you ? What about Hildegarn ? I don 't know how but the top half is inside me now ... But the bottom half is attacking the city ! - What ? he 'll possess unbelievable power ! You 'll be no hope against him ! - Big brother . Maybe I can build something more powerful to help you ! you must kill me ! - Big brother ! - Do it quickly ! - No you don 't ! - Trunks ! - Big brother ! Play it ! - Right ! - Big brother ! - His body ... - Reformed ! - After a thousand years of waiting the mighty Hildegarn is whole again ! Now drink deeply of these Earthling 's energy ! - Big brother ! - It doesn 't matter what you try . He 's unstoppable ! - You fool ! - Now you will taste the full power of Hildegarn ! - We can beat him ! - Father ! - From here on in you should leave it up to me . Stay right here Big brother ! - Trunks . - We aren 't so easily beaten ! - For something that huge . It sure moves fast ! - Father ! - I can 't tell where he 's going to reform ! - You 've really done it now . because I 'm burning eith rage ! Damn it ! I can 't compare to him ... either ! - Vegeta ! - Papa ! - Father ! we have to fuse ! - F-U-S-I-O-N HA ! Now you face a third stage Super Saiyajin . hey you monster ! This has gone far enought Gotenks is here to send you back to hell ! Rapid fire death missile barrage ! hey ! Ohh ? Is that the best you had to offer ? Big wimp ! - What are you doing ? Finish him off ! okay ! Taka that ! - It ... can 't be ! ? - No way ! - Goten ! Trunks ! - Gohan ! - Videl . - Such unbelievable power ! That monster ! Damn it ! All this damage ... innocent people will be hurt . Damn ! No matter how much ... we throw at it it just won 't fall . - That 's it ! Destory the entire galaxy ! All of it will become energy for Hildegarn to feed on ! - Why can 't I wake up from this nightmare ? - Big brother . - You fool ! It 's too late for that now ! What ? ! - A Great Hero ... Big brother is definitely a Great Hero ! too ! Feeding on the suffering of people ! With your never ending hunger ! - You can 't ! - You did it ! You did it ! Big Brother ! - Trunks ! you must kill me ! You must kill me ! - I can 't do that ! - Do you want to be a Great Hero or not ? I can 't ! the whole world is in danger while I 'm alive . Do it ! I want to die as a hero ! he 'll never be free again ! Do it ! Thank you . I 'm lucky to have met you . - NOOOOO ! YOUUUU BASTARRRRRRRRD ! - Big brother ! - You fool ! Did you think that you alone could hold back the might of Hildegarn ? I win ! - This must go no further . that 's enought ! He 's mine to finish ! his weak point ... - I know it ! I only have one chance to finish him while he 's in his full form . Is that all you 've got ? That last punch ... was pretty weak ! come on ! Let 's see what you 've got ! I 've got to do this . I can 't lose now ! It I don 't do it ... Who will ? DRAGONFIST ! - He did it ! It 's my fault that all these people had to die . If only I could control it ! - Don 't worry . Shen Long will be able to revive all those that were killed . - That should do it . It 's set . 1000 years in the past ... your timeline . - Thank you . just when I finally had a big brother and now he 's leaving . you two will meet again . that 's right ! - Trunks ! - For me ? - Yeah ! I 've got no use for it anymore . alright ! - Lucky ! and be well !

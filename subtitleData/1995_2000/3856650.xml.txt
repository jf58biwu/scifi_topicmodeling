 Attention ! Mr President . General . Welcome to Area 51 . please follow me . We 're now 24 floors beneath the surface and here 's our main research facility . - Let 's see it . - Sorry , sir , it 's a clean room . It 's static free ... Open the door . Yes , sir . My God . Why the hell wasn 't I told about this place ? Two words , Mr President . plausible deniability . I don 't get it . Where does all this come from ? How do you get funding for something like this ? You don 't actually think they spend $ 20,000 on a hammer , $ 30,000 on a toilet seat , do you ? Mr President , this is Dr Okun . He has headed up the research department on this project for the Iast 15 years . How do you do ? Mr President ! Wow ! This ... What a pleasure ! As you can imagine , they ... They don 't let us out much . I can understand that . Well ! I guess you 'd Iike to see the big tamale , huh ? Follow me . She 's a beaut , ain 't she ? As you can see from the repairs , we 've been trying to put her back together since the ' 60s . You 've had this for 40 years and you know nothing about ' em ? Oh , hell , no . We know tons about ' em . But the neatest stuff ... The neatest stuff has only happened in the Iast few days . We can 't duplicate their type of power so we 've never been able to experiment . But since these guys started showing up , all the little gizmos inside turned on . The last 24 hours have been really exciting ! Exciting ? People are dying out there . Exciting isn 't the word I 'd choose to describe it ! You 're hoping to fly this thing , huh ? You said you can repair their technology . Can you tell us anything useful about them ? Yeah . Well , I mean ... They 're not all that dissimilar from us . Breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , cold . Probably why they 're interested in our planet . Hey ... You guys wanna see ' em ? This is ... This is the vault . Or , as some of us have come to call it ... .. the freak show . When we found ' em , they were wearing some sort of biomechanical suits . Once we got ' em off , we learned a great deal about their anatomy . Eyes , ears . No vocal chords . We assume they communicate with each other by some other means . You 're obviously not thinking about hand signals and body language . It 's some kind of extrasensory perception . Telepathy . So ... It 's an organic life form . - Can they be killed ? - Their bodies are just as frail as ours . These two died in the crash . This one a few weeks later . You just have to get through their technology , which is , I 'm sorry to say , far more advanced . David , you unlocked part of their technology . - You cracked the code . - No , no . AII I did was stumble on their ... .. signal . I don 't know how helpful I can be . Why don 't you show him what you 've discovered so far ? Figure out what they haven 't thought of yet . We 'II see if you 're as smart as we all hope you are . What code ? Captain Steven Hiller , US Marine Corps . I 'm sorry , Captain . You don 't have clearance . OK . Come here . You wanna see my clearance ? - Maybe I 'II just leave this here with you . - Let ' em pass . Get the hell out of the way ! Did you see that ? Come on down . Watch your step . Well , obviously this cockpit was designed to seat three . Though how they sat on them , I don 't know . Gently . You see these gizmos flashing ? We 've been workin ' around the clock trying to get a fix on all this . Some stuff we figured out right away . This we 're pretty sure is the life support for the cabin . And this doohickey is connected to ... Oh ... Well , it was connected to the engine . Here , take that , will ya ? These configurations ... Well , to be honest , we don 't know what the hell this crap is . But this is clearly what they use to guide and navigate their craft . Neat , huh ? Could somebody grab my laptop there ? Can I have the computer inside ? These patterns are repeating sequentially , Iike their countdown signal . They 're using that frequency for computer communications . See ? That 's how they 're coordinating their ships . You know ... You 're really starting to make us look bad . They got one ! They got one alive ! - They got one . alive ! - Jesus ! You 'II be OK by yourself , Dave ? - Fine . - Don 't touch anything . Everybody 's always telling me not to touch anything . Oh ! It 's all wet . Right here ! In the back of the pickup . General , sir . Captain Steven Hiller , United States Marine Corps . Guess who 's comin ' to dinner ! I need a doctor . A doctor ! Oh , boy ! - How long has he been unconscious ? - About three hours . - Let 's get him in containment . - My son is very sick . He needs attention ! He 's drying out . I want him sprayed down with saline . He has a problem with his adrenal cortex ! please ! If you don 't do something right now , my son will die ! - Just help him ! - Okay . O 'Haver , Miller , you come with us . You , take us to him , OK ? Let 's go . AII right . Move it ! As the former head of the CIA , you knew about this place . - When were you planning to inform us ? - It had been deemed classified . You should have told us about this when they first arrived ! We wouldn 't have launched a counterattack that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots ! We could not have known that our fighters would 've been that ineffective ! Mr President . The little bit of information we have comes directly into this room . Atlanta , Chicago , and Philadelphia . Destroyed . NATO and Western allied installations were the first to be taken out . Then we were hit . They knew exactly where and how to hit us . - And our forces ? - We 're down to 15 % . If you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on , we 're looking at the worldwide destruction of every major city in the next 36 hours . We 're being exterminated . Mr President ! This is Captain Steven Hiller . - Captain . - Mr President . Well done . - Where is it now ? - It 's isolated in the containment lab , sir . I 'd Iike to go see it . General , I 'm really anxious to get back to EI Toro . Hasn 't anyone told you ? EI Toro has been completely destroyed . We were lucky . Today was the first time I used the subway . Thank God for the Metro Rail . These should last us a while . Don 't move . I 'II get it for you . Stay still . - He 's your son ? - He 's my angel . Was his father stationed here ? Nah , he ... He wasn 't his father . But I was kinda hopin he wanted the job , though . - So what do you do for a living ? - I 'm a dancer . - Ballet . - No . Exotic . - Sorry . - Don 't be . I 'm not . It 's good money . Besides my baby 's worth it . Dylan ! Come here . I want you to meet the First Lady . - Hello . - Hi . I didn 't know that you 'd recognised me . Well , I didn 't want to say nothin ' . I voted for the other guy . - Life-support monitors recording . - So if we screw up , it 's all on tape . Come on . Let 's get this biomechanical suit off . Put the spreader right here , along the ridge . Microprobe thingamajig goes right here . Pick there . Good . AII right , now spread it very , very gently . Let me get in . Gentle , gentle , that 's it . Run this right in ... AII right . Let 's proceed . Now comes the really icky part . Oh , boy . This is one smelly , disgusting ... Look at it . It doesn 't look alive , does it ? The arm is moving . Doctor ? Doctor ? Doctor ? Don 't move ! Dr Okun ? Release me . - Open the door . Get him out ! - No , wait . Release me . I know there is much we can learn from each other if we can negotiate a truce . We can find a way to coexist . Can there be a peace between us ? Peace . No peace . What is it you want us to do ? Die . Die ! Mr President . - Is that glass bulletproof ? - No , sir . - Are you all right ? - I saw his thoughts . I saw what they 're planning to do . They 're like locusts . They 're moving from planet to planet . Their whole civilisation . After they 've consumed every natural resource , they move on . And we 're next . Nuke ' em . Let 's nuke the bastards . Just my luck . No ice . I take it you 've heard ? Hey , toast . - To the end of the world . - He didn 't come to this decision lightly . He didn 't have any other choice . - Well , you still believe in him . - Well , he 's a good man . He 'd better be . You left me for him . Or , you know ... for your career . You know , it wasn 't just my career . It was the biggest opportunity of my Iife . I wanted my Iife to make a difference . I wanted my Iife to mean something . And ... I wasn 't ... ambitious enough for you ? David , you could have done anything you wanted . Research , development ... I was happy where I was . Haven 't you ever wanted to be part of something special ? I was part of something special . Well , if it makes any difference , I never stopped loving you . But that wasn 't enough , was it ? Let 's pick it up , man . Let 's go ! Let 's pick it up , man ! We 're on a tight schedule ! Pick it up , man ! Pick it up ! What the hell are you doin ' ? Get outta there ! I got something I gotta handle . I 'm borrowing ' it . - No , you 're not , sir . - Do you really wanna shoot me ? Just tell ' em I hit you . Command , this is Retal Op. Squadron is in the air . We are on station and awaiting instructions . Break formation . Head to targets . Sir . They 're breaking formation . - We 're initiating sequence code . - Verification : alpha Zulu six eight niner . Which city will be reached first ? Houston , Texas . ETA , six minutes and counting down . - Houston . - The major cities have been deserted . Civilian casualties should be down to a minimum . Command , this is Neighbourhood Watch . We are in position . Tracking monitors are locked on . We are going to visual recon . Roger . - We have confirmation . - Launch code confirmed . alpha Zulu six eight niner , standing by . Laser targeting . Locked on . We 're locked on , sir . Do you wish to deploy ? Mr President , if you wish to deploy , the time is now . - Mr President ? - Deploy . That 's a go . alpha Zulu six eight niner . Here we go . Bird 's away . We have visual confirmation of the missile . It 's on target . Approaching . May our children forgive us . Five seconds to impact . Three , two , one . It 's a hit ! Get down ! Get down ! Can we confirm that the target was destroyed ? Get the tank commander . Confirm the target was destroyed . Red Arrow , alpha 9723 . Can you read ? - Repeat . You 're breaking up . - We have lost visual . Roger that . We 're looking for confirmation . We got the bastards . Good job , everyone ! Congratulations . Commander , do you have visual ? We need visual confirmation . Has the target been destroyed ? Negative . Target remains . I repeat , target remains . Call the other planes back . The others might have more luck . We shouldn 't give up ! I said call them back ! - Abort . - Abort mission . Issue the abort codes right away . This is an abort , full abort . Do you read ? Jasmine ! You 're late ! You know I Iike to make an entrance . - Where are we going ? - Through there , sir . Mr President . Your wife is resting comfortably for the moment . - Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier ... - Hey , there she is ! Go on ! - She doesn 't look too good . - Your wife is bleeding internally . - Perhaps if we 'd gotten to her earlier ... - What are you saying ? We can 't stop the bleeding . If we 'd ... There 's nothing we can do for her . We were worried . We didn 't know where you were . - You 've gotten bigger , I think . - I did ? You just keep growing and growing . I can 't ... Hey . Can you wait outside for a Iittle bit so Mom can get a rest ? Come on , Munchkin . I 'm so sorry that I didn 't come home when you asked me to . It 's OK . The doctors ... .. think that you 're ... gonna be just fine . Liar . Is Mommy sleeping now ? Yeah . Mommy 's sleeping . David ! - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm makin ' a mess ! Yeah . This I can see . We gotta burn this toxic waste , pollute the air and rip up the ozone ! Cos maybe if we screw this planet up enough ... .. they won 't want it any more . Wait . David . - Don 't do this to yourself . Listen to me . - I 'm listening . Everyone loses faith at some point in their life . Even myself . I haven 't spoken to God since your mother died . You see , sometimes we have to remember what we still have . Like what ? Well , you still have your health . David , you need your rest . Come on ! Get off this freezing floor before you catch cold . Come on ! - What did you just say ? - About faith ? - Well , you see , a man ... - No . - The other part . - What ? I don 't want you to catch cold . What is that ? What is the matter with you ? - Genius . - Genius ? My dad . A total genius . Jerry , wake up . We got work to do . Get everybody down here right away . - Look at that ! - Wow ! - Does that thing really fly in outer space ? - It most certainly does . - Sure doesn 't look like it . - They 're here . - AII right , what 's this all about ? - I have no idea . Get everybody off . Right , clear the platform . Let 's go . - Major Mitchell . Do you have a pistol ? - What ? - Have you got a gun ? - Sergeant , your sidearm . See that Coke can on top of the alien craft ? Think you can shoot that thing off ? - Shoot it . - Sir ? Go ahead . - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . My fault . That Coke can was protected by the craft 's shield . - We can 't penetrate it . - What 's your point ? My point is , if we can 't beat their defences , then we gotta get around them . Major . One more time ... Any time . - How did you do that ? - I gave it a cold . I gave it a virus . A computer virus . Are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields ? Just like they used our satellites against us , we can use their own signal against them . If we plant a virus into that mother ship , it 's gonna filter down into all the corresponding ships below . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . How exactly do we infect the mother ship with this virus ? We 're ... We 're gonna have to ... fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it . We can enter here , as shown in these satellite photos . We then upload the virus , set off some kind of explosion which 'II disable it . That 'II disorient the smaller ships below and that could buy you some time to ... to take ' em ... take ' em out . Take ' em down . Do your ... Do your stuff . - This is ridiculous ! - How long would their shields be down ? Eh ... I dunno . A matter of minutes . You want us to coordinate a counterstrike with a window of a few minutes ? - With shields down , it might be possible . - Oh , please ! We don 't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign ! Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan depends on a machine that no one in this world is qualified to operate . I wouldn 't say that , sir . I 've seen them in action . I 'm aware of their manoeuvring capabilities . With your permission , General , I 'd Iike the opportunity to try . That thing is a wreck . It crash-Ianded in the ' 50s . We don 't even know if it 's capable of flying ! Jim , remove the clamps . Any questions ? Let 's do it . AII right , you heard the President ... - Good luck , pilot . - Thank you , Mr President . A virus . Your idea . That 's right . Do you really think you can fly that thing ? Do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said ? I understand you are upset over your wife 's death . But that 's no excuse for making another fatal mistake . No , my mistake was to appoint a snivelling weasel like you as Secretary of Defense . - You don 't understand ! - However , that is one mistake I am thankful to say that I don 't have to live with . - Mr President ... - Mr Nimsiki , you 're fired . Let 's organise every plane we can find and get us some goddamn pilots to fly ' em . - Yes , sir . - He can 't do that . Well , he just did . Command has attempted to list casualties and losses , but information is sketchy . We know they 've lost the Belgian contingent in the Sinai . There 's a strong possibility reinforcements are hiding in the Golan Straits . - What is he saying ? - They 're getting a signal . old Morse code . It 's from the Americans . They want to organise a counteroffensive ! It 's about bloody time ! What do they plan to do ? We have confirmed reports of combat-ready divisions - in Europe , the Middle East , and Asia . - Impressive . Considering it 's all done with ... Morse code . - The armed forces here ? - We have sufficient aircraft , but ... - But what ? - Pilots are comin ' up short . Well , then , find ' em . Ham radio operators from New York to Japan trade rumours of military forces in hiding , unwilling to reveal themselves for fear of annihilation ... We ' re planning to launch a counteroffensive . With our depleted manpower , we ' re asking that anyone with flight experience come forward . Military training is preferable , but anyone who can fly would be useful . I can fly . I 'm a pilot . AII right , guys ! Listen up ! Pay attention . These F-18s are very different than the jets you piloted . - It 's strong . - Forgive the expression , but this is a crash course in modern avionics . - Keep it comin ' . - OK , you got it ! AII right , listen up . First we need some background information on your experience . Let 's start with you . Who , me ? Well , I 'm Russell Casse , sir . And after ' Nam I got into crop-dusting . And been doing that ever since . On a personal note , sir , I 'd just like to add that ever since I was kidnapped by aliens 10 years ago , I have been dyin ' for some payback . I just want you to know that I won 't let you down . You have one tactical nuclear missile we 're loading into this launcher under the right wing . This is the firing mechanism . It 'II be attached to the ship 's main console . Just like the Amraam launch pad on a Stealth . Except the nuke will not detonate at impact . You 'II have 30 seconds to get your asses out of there . Good luck , gentlemen . 30 seconds . It 's the strongest radio transmitter we had . It 'II tell us when you 've uploaded the virus . 30 seconds . Don 't you think that 's cutting it too close ? We 're gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off . Why you ? David ! I don 't understand why you can 't show someone else how to plant the virus . No . Something may go wrong . I may have to think quickly , adjust the signal . Who knows ? Hey , you know how I 'm always trying to save the planet ? Here 's my chance . Now he gets ambitious . - It 's too tight . - Well , I had to borrow it . Let me see . OK . AII right , I guess that 's good enough . So . How do I Iook ? Oh , thank you . You 're a Iot of help . - You 're late ! - Well , you know me . I know . You like to make a big entrance . Listen . Before we do this , I just wanna say I 'm sorry . Sorry for what , babe ? I should have done this a Iong time ago . - Do you have the ring ? - Yes , sir . Here , make yourself useful . Witnesses ? - We got hung up . - Well , Iet 's get this show on the road . Dearly beloved , we 're gathered here in the sight of God and in the presence of these witnesses to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony . Any person who can show good cause why these two should not wed , please speak now or for ever hold your peace . Steve , will you take this woman to be your wedded wife , to live together with her in the holy state of matrimony ? Will you love her , comfort her , honour and keep her in sickness and in health , and , forsaking all others , keep yourself only for her as long as you both shall live ? I will . Good morning . They 're a Iittle young . That they are . They look a Iittle nervous . I need all flight crews to report to their designated areas . - Major . Can I borrow that ? - Sir . Good morning . Good morning . In less than an hour , aircraft from here will join others from around the world . And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind . Mankind . That word should have new meaning for all of us today . We can 't be consumed by our petty differences any more . We will be united in our common interest . Perhaps it 's fate that today is the Fourth of July . And you will once again be fighting for our freedom . Not from tyranny , oppression or persecution . But from annihilation . We 're fighting for our right to live . To exist . And should we win the day , the Fourth of July will no Ionger be known as an American holiday , but as the day when the world declared in one voice , " We will not go quietly into the night ! " " We will not vanish without a fight ! " " We 're going to live on ! " " We 're going to survive ! " Today , we celebrate our Independence Day ! - Let 's go ! - Mr President . Right this way , sir . - I 've got your gear over here . - Good luck ! I 've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is here . You 've got your choice of helmets . Mr President , I 'd sure like to know what you 're doing . I 'm a combat pilot , Will . I belong in the air . OK , sir . Let 's get you airborne . As soon as I get back , we 're gonna light those fireworks , right ? Here . Take these . Just in case . Where 's ... Just in case . I 'm very proud of you . Be careful , OK ? It 's time . - I Iove you . - I Iove you . Oh , damn ! Wait a minute . - We gotta find some cigars . I can 't ... - Here ! Take these . My last two . You are a lifesaver . almost put a hex on the whole damn thing ! - Missile launch . - Oh , crap ! What do I hit ? Which one ? I picked a hell of a day to quit drinkin ' . This is our victory dance . Not until the fat lady sings . Oh . Yes , OK . - This is important . - Fat lady . I gotcha . Open launch tunnel . Shaky , huh ? Is it gonna do this the whole way ? Make sure your seat backs are in their upright position . Yeah . Is it ? Let 's rock 'n'roll . Oops . Oops ? What does that mean ? No , I got it . Some jerk didn 't put the thing ... What do you mean , saying " oops " there ? What do you say we try that one again , huh ? Yes , without the " oops " . Thataway ! I have got to get me one of these ! - What was that ? Don 't do that ! - Just tryin ' to get a feel for the old girl . No , don 't . Leave her alone . - Look , no hands ! - Steve ! - You 're all secure , sir . - Grey , do you read me ? Roger , Eagle One . Your primary target has shifted course . - Which way they headed ? - I think our secret 's out . They 're headed straight for us . ETA , 26 minutes . - You still with me over there ? - What the hell was I thinking ? I 've been waiting for this my whole life . Head straight for it . - What the hell ? - Don 't touch ' em . Don 't ! I was counting on this . They are bringing us in . - When the hell was you gonna tell me ? - Oops . We 've got to work on our communication . - We have visual . - Do not engage until we 've confirmed - the package has been delivered . - Roger . Major , what happens if that thing gets here before the virus is planted ? This facility 's buried deep within a mountain . - It should provide us some protection . - Great . What about the people outside ? Lieutenant Sell ? We got incoming . Oh , my God . Look at that . There must be thousands of ' em . Millions . What the hell are they doing ? Looks like they 're preparing an invasion . Hey , I don 't like this ! This is stupid . They can see us . No . This thing comes fully loaded . AM / FM radio , reclining bucket seats and power windows . Come on , baby . We 're in . Do it . Do it . Sir , he 's uploading the virus . Eagle One , the package is being delivered . Stand by to engage . Roger . Eagle One , check left . Listen up ! We have an emergency situation . We need you to grab everything you can . Only what you can carry . We need to get you inside immediately . The virus is in . AII we can do now is pray . - Delivery complete . Engage . - Delivery complete . It 's a go ! Eagle One . Fox three . Gentlemen , this is it . Come on , come on . Virus ineffective . Disengage . - Get your people out . - Disengage . Rear flank , follow suit . Hold on , Command . - I want another shot at it . - Sir , I strongly recommend you disengage . Eagle One . Fox three . - Direct hit ! - It 's a hit ! Squadron leaders , fire at will ! We 're going in . Squadron leaders , take flight . - Eagle Six at seven . - Eagle Five at three . Eagle One . Fox two . Eagle Twenty ! Fox two ! Evasive manoeuvres ! Squadron leaders , evasive manoeuvres ! Prepare to engage ! AII right , Mr President ! Here we go ! AII right , baby . I 've gotcha ! Payback 's a bitch , ain 't it ? OK . Job 's done . Let 's go home . gladly . - What 's up ? - It 's stuck . - What ? - It 's not responding . It 's stuck . Try it again . Come on ! Come on ! Inside ! - Go to the elevator ! - Hurry ! Steve ! - What are you doin ' ? - They 're overriding the system . Oh , shit ! Hide . Everybody hold someone 's hand . Hold hands . Come on in . - I 'm not Jewish . - Nobody 's perfect . God ! Where are they ? This could be our last night on Earth . I don 't wanna die a virgin . If we do , we 'II both die virgins . But at Ieast we 'II be together . Are you scared ? Me , too . Eagle Seven , fox two . Eagle Three , fox two . We 're running out of missiles , sir . We 're not causing enough damage . It 's directly over us . They 're preparing to fire their primary weapon ! Then let 's take it out before it takes us out . Target at 12 o 'clock ! My God ! They 're everywhere ! - Bandits on our tail ! Locked on ! - I see ' em . Squadron leaders , I want a weapons check ! You 're outta time ! Disable it now ! I 'm in range . Locking on . I 've got tone . Eagle One , fox two ! That is a negative impact . That is an Nl . Negative impact . I 'm out of missiles . Eagle Two ! I 'm on it . Jesus ! - AII missiles have been fired . - Outta time ! Get your ass outta there ! - We 're not done yet ! - Get as far away as you can ! Doesn 't anyone have any missiles left ? Sorry I 'm late , Mr President ! I got hung up back there ! - Pilot , you armed ? - Armed and ready , sir ! I 'm packin ' ! - Who is that guy ? - Put him on speaker . - Pilot , identify yourself . - It 's me ! Russell Casse , sir . I told you I wouldn 't let you down ! Just keep those guys off me for a few more seconds , will ya ? OK . Echo Niner , Echo Seven , take flanking positions . Look after this guy , OK ? AII right , boys . Let 's give Mr Casse some cover ! Gentlemen ! Let 's plough the road ! We 'II draw them off and it 's all yours ! Look out ! Comin ' through ! I 've got tone . Eagle Twenty . Fox two . Eagle Twenty . Fox two . It 's jammed . It won 't fire . Dammit ! Do me a favour . Tell my children I Iove them very much . AII right , you alien assholes ! In the words of my generation , up yours ! Dad ! What 's he doing ? Come on , baby ! Come on , baby , come on ! Good luck , buddy . Hello , boys ! I 'm back ! He did it ! The son of a bitch did it ! AII right ! What your father did was very brave . You should be proud of him . I am . We know how to take ' em out , General . Spread the word . Get on the wire to every squadron around the world . Tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down . What do you think ? Checkmate . Well , it 's funny . I always thought things like these would kill me . It 's been a pleasure . Steve , you too . Only one thing left to do . - Ready ? - Yes , sir . Hey , all right ! Look at us . Take a look at the earthlings . Goodbye ! - Y 'all take care . Nothing but love for ya ! - Goodbye ! Do you think they know what 's about to happen ? Not a chance in hell . Good night ! Peace ! We 're loose . Can you get us outta here in 30 seconds ? - I ain 't heard no fat lady ! - Forget the fat lady . Drive us outta here ! - They 're chasing us . - You think ? - Oh , that was a hit . - We 're not hit ! Stop side-seat driving ! Left ! Tunnel ! Exit left ! - Where the hell do you think I 'm goin ' ? - OK . We 're ... - They 're closing up on us . - Shut up ! Go faster , must go faster . Go , go , go ! elvis has left the building ! Thank you very much . I Iove you , man . They 're goin ' down all over the world , Tom . We got ' em beat . How about our two delivery boys ? Any word from them ? We lost contact with Captain Hiller and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago . Hold it ! Hold on , sir . I 've got something on radar . Sorry , sir . - Good job . - Thank you . - Well done , Captain . - Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . David ... Not bad . Thank you , Mr President . Not too bad at all . Oh , so this is healthy ? Oh , I could get used to it . Happy Fourth of July , Daddy . Same to you , Munchkin . Didn 't I promise you fireworks ? Yeah . Visiontext subtitles : Julie CIayton ENGLISH

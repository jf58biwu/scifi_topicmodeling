 This airstrip on Demios is vital to securing the entire planet . General . The Sun-Yat-Sen can insert the Third Chinese Infantry on Snyder 's Plateau . We will pour down from there in two major thrusts . The Gurkhas , moving from Hornsby Ridge ... will crush them from the opposing side . Seagram 's E. E. C. troops and the West African brigades tighten the circle . Ross . The Saratoga 's Hammerheads and Phalanx II missiles will soften up the target ... followed by the Fifth Marine Expeditionary Force landing here ... establishing a toehold on the field . Intelligence . When the Chigs took the airstrip from us six months ago ... it cost them three of their finest divisions . We should expect no less of a sacrifice . Let 's hear it . For the marines , 80 % projected casualty rate . - Bloody ground . - I know . It 's steep , Glen ... but whoever controls Demios controls the entire Pegasus sector . Besides , to see an airstrip we built and lost ... now the launchpad for strike after strike ... killing thousands of our men and women , is unacceptable . Yes , sir . We 'll take it back , sir . Ladies and gentlemen , the invasion of Demios ... is the first step of Operation Roundhammer ... an ambitious series of planet - hopping maneuvers ... designed to drive the war to the heart of Chig territory . As supreme commander of Earth Forces ... I 'm proud to lead you all into this battle . Today is the first domino . Let 's make it fall . - Wow . Real steak and fresh eggs . - Only one reason we 're gettin ' this kind of chow . We 're goin ' in . We thought we were alone . We believed the universe was ours . Until one night in 2063 , on an Earth colony 16 light - years away ... they struck . And now we are at war . My name is Lieutenant Colonel T. C. McQueen . I 'm an InVitro , a race of artificially gestated humans . I command a Marine Corps squadron - The 58th . They call us the Wild Cards . We fight when called - in space , on land and at sea . To lose this war means more than defeat . To surrender is to never go home . All of us must rise to the call above and beyond . May the Lord bless you and keep you ... in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit . Amen . - Pick it up ! - Five - eight . You 'll supply air support until the ground forces have secured their positions . At that time , you 'll put ' em down and anchor the airstrip . Loading bays one through 14 operational , sir . - - Secure for deployment . - - All support personnel , clear flight deck . Commence Hammerhead engagement sequence . Eisenhower , Yorktown battle groups are in position , sir . Domino . Domino . Domino . Domino . Ships report no return fire from planet , sir . - Butter 's melting . - Drop the hammers . Hammerhead engagement sequence complete . Prepare for launch . Two ducks on the pond . Who wants ' em ? I got ' em . Saratoga , this is Wild Cards . Butter 's melted . Sector 212 taken . No resistance . - Sector 2 - 1 - niner secured . - Sector four overrun . - Sector 247 , we are secure . - 315 in place . A. A. G. ' s armed and ready , sir . All MEU 's accounted for , reporting minimal casualties , sir . Airstrip sector secured . Key code is Zulu Bravo Charlie . - 39 . 1 gigahertz . - Azimuth ? Stellar waypoint finder says 38 degrees . Direct parabolic antenna ? - Solar cell . - Ready . Saratoga , this is Wild Cards . Transmission code is 4-3-64 . Alien presence nominal . Why aren 't I celebrating ? It seems fruits of victory have fallen too easily into our mouths . Eight months ago , the Chigs nearly bled themselves dry to take this airfield ... and today , they just walk away . Why ? Why ? Call the Eisenhower . Proceed with the next stage . Admiral Vetter , General Weirick instructs you ... to reinforce Demios as per stage " B. ' " - Let 's get on it . - Aye-aye . Sir , single bogey bearing 1 - 7 - niner . - Where the hell did he come from ? - It 's reversing its course ... back towards the moon Opus Five . If I were a lonely Chig , I 'd turn tail when I saw the Eisenhower . Before we deploy to that sector , launch Hammerhead Squadron 34 ... - and have ' em take that Chig pest out of my sky . - Yes , ma 'am . Eisenhower command , this is The Croaker . 34th Squadron has visual contact with the bogey . Roger that , Croaker . Maintain radio contact . King Air , this is The Croaker . You 'll be the first to take your shot . Roger , Croaker , and thank you for my next medal . Locking on to bogeyman . King Air , this is The Croaker . Come in . King Air , this is The Croaker . Do you read me ? Eisenhower command , this is The Croaker . Rounding Opus Five . - I think King Air may have waxed his target . - Roger that , Croaker . - - - Mission status , Lt. Feeley ? - We just lost radio and LI DAR contact . But that 's to be expected when they round the moon . Admiral ... it was five on one , ma 'am , and they 'd already locked on to it . I can 't let one Chig warship keep supplies from our people on planet . - Is sector 2-1-niner clear ? - Crystal , Admiral . Then set course . All ahead full . Look at this place . You 'd think we were off theJersey Turnpike ... instead of millions of miles from home . Ow , man ! Chigs dumped all over the food before they left . - Go for it . High in protein . - I already get my allowance from you guys . They didn 't get to the coffee sweeteners . We 'll secure it and make it our command center . Would 've been a nice gig being stationed on this planet . The Eisenhower should 've checked in by now . Try them again . - Eisenhower , this is Saratoga . Come in . - Maybe it 's a radio problem , sir . The Eisenhower 's not transmitting . - Switch frequencies . - Yes , sir . Eisenhower , this is Saratoga . Do you read me ? Eisenhower , this is Saratoga . Respond . Eisenhower , this is the Saratoga . Please come in . Eisenhower , this is the Saratoga . Please come in . Eisenhower , this is Wild Cards . Come in . What 's up ? Should be the Eisenhower overhead . I can 't get a fix . - This thing 's out of juice . - Never thought when I was goin 'in that I 'd have time for a shave . You know what this battle reminds me of ? You remember that Lakers-Bulls final about seven years ago ? - Wasn 't born yet . - Right . Then I guess it would be tough for you to remember . - That one that went to a ninth game ? - Everyone thought ... the Lakers were gonna pound Chicago , but it was the 60th anniversary ... of MichaelJordan 's 110-point game . Bulls got fired up just like us . It 's nothing from the Eisenhower 's battle group . What 's the Saratoga 's key code frequency again ? - 39 . 1 . - Waypoint finder says 38 degrees by 120 degrees . Sir , the H. M. S. Invincible is down . U. S. S. Tecumseh is signaling Mayday . - The Eisenhower 's gone . - Ready those forward fire decks now ! Enemy 's superior . Squadrons descending on planet . Scramble ! Scramble ! Get airborne ! Come on ! - - Enemy aircraft 50 miles out . ! In here ! - Get down ! Get down ! - Move it ! Go ! Enemy has achieved air superiority over the airstrip . Do not dispatch any further squadrons until so ordered . The Chigs must have pulled their forces from another position . Frankly , sir , Intelligence is not sure . Admiral . Clear the room . As you were , Colonel . Gentlemen , we find ourselves in the midst of our collective countries ' ... greatest military disaster ... because of which a door has opened possibly ... to our greatest achievement . Lxion . A territory of monumental strategic importance ... being a mere 50 astronomical units from the Chigs ' home planet . This was so heavily fortified and believed so unobtainable ... that Earth Force battle plans conceded lxion to the Chigs . - " Believed " ? - This communiqu√© ... is from the Earth Forces Chiefs of Staff in New York . The alien fleet currently attacking us is from lxion . They 're using the lxion forces to counterattack ... and have left the planet unprotected . - Why would they do that ? - They must be spread thinner than we believe . They 're gambling to engage us here . It 's hard enough to know the hearts and minds of a human enemy . In any case , their butter becomes ours if we don 't seize this opportunity . Dispatch the Fourth Fleet to that area instead of bringing it here for support . Sir , without their support , our fight is made all the tougher . General , the Fourth Fleet would never get here in time . They 're 1 , 400 A. U. ' s away . We are closest to lxion . Ourjob is not finished here . You said it yourself , Glen . Without support , this fleet is going under . Lxion is infinitely more important ... than a tiny airstrip on Demios , Commodore . Taking lxion now would cut two years off the war ... and could save a million lives . At the expense of 25,000 lives , my lives , fighting down on planet . Colonel , I know you to be a student of military history . What is your counsel ? I would retreat this fleet and then advance to lxion . The Chig counterattack will be severe . I would send the Fourth Fleet to lxion as support . The 58 is down there , McQueen . In the Second World War , thejapanese committed their finest troops ... to protecting the island of Guadalcanal ... neglecting the strategic importance of New Guinea . Our marines were on their own for eight months ... while the Allies exploited thejapanese mistake . It broke the back of the Nippon Offensive . After the Canal , we took the war to them . We will not abandon our troops on planet . Ming , pull back two supply ships to a distance of one A. U. It will resupply the forces on Demios at any window of opportunity . I respect your thoughts , Commodore , but this battle will not be won here . We 'll win it at lxion . - - We got ' em . ! - - Incoming ! Saratoga , this is Demios in immediate need of air support . The French division is in retreat . We 've lost our right flank . ! In jeopardy of losing our position . - Request immediate air support . - Where the hell are they ? Commodore Ross . Sir . The right thing to do is rarely the easiest . McQueen , right now our people on planet don 't have the luxury of time ... to consider right or wrong . Hell , they don 't have time to think . They can only react , dead or alive . You and I have been there ... and we know that amidst all the hellfire and fear ... and the seconds between firing and being fired upon ... there is a whisper in their hearts that feels ... like a scream at the top of their lungs saying , " We 'll be there to back them up . " And now we won 't be . Yes , sir , I have been there . I know that hell . And I would give my life ... if it meant that one other human being would not have to go through ... what those kids are going through down there . And I know my kids feel the same way . Taking lxion now would save a million kids from that hell . I just can 't bring myself to leave them . Me neither . I wanna join them ... sir . Request permission to stay with the supply ship with the intent of going on planet . Permission denied . I 'm not going to reduce the Corps 's finest pilot to a supply sergeant . Commodore Ross - Glen - I 'm asking as a friend . And I 'm responding as one . No . All of us are going to lose too many friends in this war . Hey , man , everyone else has bolted over the ridge . We 're the only ones left out here . We should fall back to supplementary positions . McQueen and Ross would want us to hold our position and wait for air cover . - Ross and McQueen ain 't down here ! - Yes , they are . - What 's the word ? - Saratoga , this is Demios . Request response to request for air cover . Situation deteriorating . Many units in retreat . Airfield in jeopardy of being taken . Many casualties . Request response . - Demios , this is the Saratoga . - Lieutenant . Marines , this is Commodore Ross of the U. S. S. Saratoga . We remain proud of you . Due to security reasons ... I am unable to explain this painful directive . Due to the fortunes of war : Black Forest . I say again : Black Forest . - No air support . - Red Sea . Red Sea . No ground reinforcement . You are encouraged but not so ordered ... to continue to engage the enemy . Lf , however , your positions become untenable ... you are authorized to surrender . Semper fidelis . - And may God be with you always . - Helmsman . Weigh anchor . Set a course for the Helios system . - We 'll be back for them . - Yes , sir . If they 're still here . You know the drill . No ammo . Oh , man . A man 's gotta have hope . Oh , God , the Creator and Redeemer of all the faithful ... - hear our supplication ... - And through thy infinite love and mercy ... graciously grant to the soul of thy servant departed ... The remission of all their sins , by which they may have ... - deserved the severity - - - Don 't look at me . - That was me that time . Of thy justice and punishment in the world to come . I don 't know why we bother with this . Nobody 's gonna do it for us . - It 's not gonna happen to us . - Marines always bury their dead . - Oh , but they abandon their living . - Give it up , man ! We all know they wouldn 't have left us here for no reason . And when they 're done with whatever it is , they 'll be back . 1900 hours . Satellite 's up . - Key code ? - Tango Echo Charlie . Frequency 42 . 4 gigahertz . Stellar waypoint finder indicated 49 degrees azimuth . Solar cell ? Hawkes ? We may be out of this war , but we still have a duty . Now , on your feet . - - Saratoga , this is Demios . People , this is the 53rd day of the counterattack ... and we have not lost any ground . - I don 't wanna lose any today . - Has E. E. C. Third Wing reported yet ? Sir , I 'm searching all frequencies , but I can 't cut through incoming transmissions . Every day at 1900 , this happens . Planet Demios reporting enemy location at grid point ... 784983 ... approximately 3,000 in number . Enemy appears to have abandoned this fight . They brought ' em all here to fight this one . Buried 15 marine casualties today . Uncertain of survivors on planet . Have not come in contact with any friendlies . Demios , this is Saratoga . You are jamming our communications ! Cease with your transmissions ! | Five-eight , this is Queen Six . Transmission received . Relay to Pegasus Theater command . Good work . These are vital reports . Keep up the good work , 58 . This is Queen Six , out . Don 't you ever make them think they are not needed ! I say we bail this burial patrol ... start spending our time looking for any supply drops we can find . Help . ! Help me . ! - Help . ! - Help . ! I need help . ! - We can 't just let him suffer . - It 's B. S. It 's a playback device . There 's three Chigs out there . - Let 's take ' em out . - No ammo . - You just gonna let ' em mess with our heads like this ? - Shh . Help . ! Help . ! - You eat yellow snow , you Chigs ! - Shh . - " You eat yellow snow " ? - It was off the top of my head . Hear me . Abe Lincoln 's dead . - What 's that supposed to mean ? - They 're using stuff they think will get us mad , psyche us out . " Abe Lincoln 's dead 's " supposed to psyche us ? That 's just a statement of fact . Chigs didn 't do their homework . - Hey , marines , Chicago Cubs suck . ! - Let 's get those sons of - - It 's okay . It 's okay . - Help me . ! Hey . Give it up . - Help me . ! - No . It 's real . They 're goin ' out for him ! Let 's move ! - - - They 're finished . - Come on . Come on . Nathan , Cooper , keep an eye out . Foot powder . Finally luck in on a supply drop . All we get is foot powder . Paul ? Paul , that 's dirt . Paul ? Paul , are you all right ? The heat from the explosion melted the sugar into the dirt . Better leave this here . For the time when this battle is finally over . I 've lost count ofhow many times I 've wondered if I 'll ever see them again . But some lives never leave your heart . Some lives are more important than our own . I have to tell you , sir . Some time ago ... I wouldn 't understand what you were talking about . But those kids , we - I left behind . I can 't stop thinking about them , if they 're all right ... what they must be going through , how proud I am ... when they call every day at 1900 . You know , Ty ... someday that call won 't come . A shooting star . Maybe it 's a sign ofhope . That 's not a shooting star . It 's debris from the Eisenhower falling out of orbit . That 'll happen for years . Well , we ain 't gonna be around to see it . Shut the hell up ! From day one , you have made cracks like that ! What the hell good does it do , huh ? What is the point ? Shane , he 's just worn down . We all are . This area 's familiar . It 's the airstrip . We 're back where we started . Commodore , the enemy is clearly superior . There are 100,000 troops on planet . I will not do to them what you had me do to the troops on Demios . Ross , it is time to get the hell out of Dodge . That 's an order . Stand down , Ross . I am responsible . I was responsible for the defeat on Demios , and I will be responsible for our defeat here . Stand down . Saratoga , this is Demios . As of 0620 this morning ... we have retaken the airfield . Awaiting orders . Sir , there was no defeat at Demios ... - and there will be no defeat here . - Raise position to 15,000 kilometers . I want the 27 , the 32 and the 53rd Squadron ... in my sky on the double and raining fire . ! U. S. S. Michigan and Nevada reporting enemy retreat . - Air forces on planet have achieved air superiority . - It 's ours . Yeah ! Yeah ! No word from Demios . Saratoga , this is Demios at 1900 hours . - We report signs of other survivors on planet - - Tell ' em we need supplies . - None have come forth to the airfield . - And not foot powder . ! Or shoelaces ! We need food ! Listen to me ! I know you left us here to die , and - This radio 's dead . - It fried out about 12 days ago . - Why didn 't you tell us ? You been puttin ' us through this charade for the last two weeks ? Does Captain Vansen think we couldn 't handle it ? Do you think we 're children , a bunch of idiots ? Back off , Hawkes . What are you gonna do ? You gonna throw me in the brig for striking an officer ? If that 's the kind of leader you are - a liar - I am not one of you anymore . I can 't believe you did that to us . How long would you have let it go on ? I 'm goin ' with Hawkes . I did it because without the radio , without a purpose every day ... I knew this would happen . But now that it 's done , now that it 's over , go . It will be a relief not to be in command anymore ... not to be responsible for four other lives . More pieces of the Eisenhower . No . It 's not losing altitude . Looks like a Chig attack squadron maybe a few hundred miles out . They 're gonna bomb and level this place . Let 's get to the diner . We 'll get our gear and take off . I don 't wanna run anymore . Without the hope of them coming for us ... or us sticking together , I don 't wanna run anymore . If you can 't run , I won 't either . I took this from that drawer ... a while ago . And I 'll be honest . I wasn 't gonna tell anyone . Our last supper . - - Everyone gets to wet a finger to the first knuckle . Whatever sticks is yours . It 's not a bombing run . They 're landing . I ain 't gonna be no Chig prisoner . Sorry to just drop in , but you don 't call anymore . As a commander , I feel no need to explain my actions . But as a man , as a human being ... I must share my emotions . I have never been more ashamed of myself ... or more proud of you . Welcome home . I thought you 'd like to know ... APC 's picked up approximately 2,000 survivors above planet . Sir . All of us who made it back ... don 't ever want to forget those who didn 't . Oh , I 'm so tired . I just wanna sleep , but I can 't . It 's like I 'm supposed to be doin 'something . I can 't remember what . Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

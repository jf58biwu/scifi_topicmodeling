 Give me some more . Come on , honey , get it all off ! Come on , make me stand up for queen and country . Show us what you got ! Come on , honey . Come on , all of it . Yeah , there you go . All of it . Come on . And the rest ! Ah , come on , babe . If one more person calls me " babe " ... Mr. Santo , the package has arrived . My special order ? Under lock and key . What about the new dancer ? Who ? The blonde with the guns . Ah , if she 's more to your pleasing ... It 's her first night , and I haven 't had a chance to feel her out . But I 'm sure you 'll be very pleased with the special order . She is as tender as Tuscan veal . How 's the crowd , honey ? Wet . Come again . She 's Chinese . Very well done . They loved you . I 'd like to talk to you about coming back . In my office . I 'll be waiting for you . Sure thing , big boy . What are you doing here ? Looking for a light . Oh . Got one ? I don 't smoke . Neither do I. Who are you ? I 'm the one who 's getting you out of here . Trust me . Right this way , Mr. Santo . Shit . Come on . Go ! What are you doing ? Ever see Batman ? No , I can 't . Shut up . God damn it ! Here 's your little pride and joy . Thank you . Thank you , from the bottom of our hearts . We thought we 'd never see our little girl again . Thank you . Cut the shit . Where 's my money ? Honey , pay this woman . I 'm afraid there 's been a slight problem . I could only come up with half the money . Half the money ? Fine . I 'll take half your daughter . Wait . I 'm sure we can negotiate something . The car plus the cash . Not a bad night 's work . It was the middle of the Second American Civil War . The world had gone to hell . The year was 2017 . The worst year of my life . There was only one free city . And that 's where I lived for three years . Port Steel Harbor . What a shithole . Why don 't we start again ? From the beginning . I told you . I told you everything I know . I told you . Mind scan up on screen one , Colonel . Image is present . Image is recording . Citizen , I abhor torture . But your words just don 't match your thoughts . There are too many details that you 're just not sharing . Our little mind-reading device doesn 't lie . Reset sensors . Now , where 's Dr. Corrina Devonshire ? She 's going to Steel Harbor , the free city . Can you tell me why Cora D 's going to Steel Harbor ? She 's meeting members of the Resistance . They 're giving her the retinal lenses , helping her out of the country , to Canada . She 's with a freedom fighter named Axel . Who has the retinal lenses now ? Krebs . I 'm coming . William Krebs . How are they getting her into the city ? She 's had plastic surgery . Her face has changed . You won 't recognize her . You 'll never find her . You 're so beautiful . I 'm sorry . Colonel Pryzer , Executive Council on line two . Tell him to hold . Subject terminated . Put him on . Colonel Pryzer , any word yet on our traitorous doctor , Cora D ? I 'm not gonna pander to that mythic-name bullshit . Well , Dr. Devonshire still poses quite a problem to the Congressionals . Her escape could jeopardize our strongest defensive action yet . I 'm fully aware of that , citizen . Dr. Devonshire was privy to some of the most sensitive military secrets of the Congressional Republic . Her DNA holds the antidote to our greatest biochemical weapon . She must be captured alive at any cost . I 'll take care of your problem , citizen . I 'll get my hands dirty for you again . I wouldn 't be cleaning up your mess if you 'd stopped her from escaping Washington in the first place . Well , I ... I had no direct knowledge of that operation . Of course it was a vital part of our contract to ... Save it for the U N. Dr. Corrina Devonshire , Cora D , whatever she calls herself , it really doesn 't matter . She belongs to me . She 's connecting with a Resistance contact named Krebs . He has the lenses and will be helping her leave the Congressional territories . They 're meeting in the free city , Steel Harbor . I 'll contact their local authorities immediately . You see , I do my homework , citizen . It 's them . Let 's go . Which one of you is Krebs ? We 'll meet him later . Hurry . I said get to the back of the line . Gentlemen , I 'll take those weapons . Don 't lose the clip . Don 't worry about it . Dry Martinis and a Cuban cigar . You got it . Bubbly on the house . Please , be polite . Excuse me , Curly . Hey , hey , hey . I 'm still waiting to hear from Miss Wire . I conveyed your offer to her . $ 1,500 to chop off the legs of your ex-partner ? You must be joking . Naturally , she declined . Miss Wire doesn 't accept this kind of job . Please . What ? My money is not good enough for her ? I will make my offer in person . If I were you I wouldn 't do that . Why ? Miss Wire 's private secretary , Camille , here , doesn 't have you in her appointment book , and she can be very mean . You see ? Time for a couple of dedications . To Bobby from Carlene , " The tests came back and everything is cool . " And from Samantha to Kyle , " You thieving , murderous bastard . " If I ever see you again , I 'll rip out your eyes and pluck off your ears . " Damn , but that don 't just tug at my heart strings . Now , here 's a little rhythm for you heartsick boys and girls . Chanel No. 5 . Am I correct ? Yes , you are . Ah . When I smelled it , I thought to myself , " Charlie , now this is obviously a woman of significant breeding . " And then I thought , " I wonder if she 'd like to do some . " Breeding , that is . What do you think about that , sweetheart ? Who are you talking to ? Some chick . Where 's your mercurial sister ? Why don 't you try the office ? Oh , and when you see her , tell her I only had two . Okay . Whatever you say , Charlie . That 's my boy . Goddamn . Customs police . Stay put . We 'll handle this . Evening , Officer . You got your ID ? Yes , sir . Right here . Something feels wrong . This is making me very nervous . Look , we just stick with the plan , okay ? Change of plans . Let 's go . Run ! Get out of here ! Go ! We got ' em . Hold your fire ! Oh , shit . Damn ! Find ' em now ! I 'm sorry , boss . Is this a good moment to talk about the payroll ? No . Tonight 's fan mail . Three offers to sell black market dollars , another offer to buy the bar , an urgent request to contact the Resistance , and a badly-scented proposal of marriage . No more valentines , Curly . Oh , it 's awful . Look , boss , I hate to keep bringing this up , I really do , but tomorrow 's payday . What am I going to use for money , a smile ? Relax , Curly , I got it covered . Are we going out ? For a while . Just how far out are we going to go ? I want to get some air . But I thought you got some air last night . That didn 't happen . This isn 't happening either . Anybody asks , I 'm taking a bubble bath . Barb , I just don 't like ... Just keep Charlie out from under the tables . It 's embarrassing . I will . East sector is clear . Is there anyone in the west ? It 's all clear here . We 're moving to the next sector . Over . Sweet dreams . Okay . Okay , let 's go . Now what ? We find Krebs . Any bright ideas how ? Just one . I had to do a little moonlighting to keep my bar running . Not an easy life . A girl 's got to do what a girl 's got to do . And in this world , you got to use everything you got . Hey , handsome , want some company ? Are you a cop ? See a badge ? You got your med reg ? Full medical . Checked yesterday . How much is this gonna cost me ? That depends on how you want to play . Well , I like to play rough . Me , too . Hey , nice nuts . Get a life . Apartment 472 . One guest . Apartment 472 . One guest . Retinal scan verified . Ruben Tenenbaum . 10811 . How romantic . Ooh . I have an idea . Why don 't you go change into something a little more comfortable ? How about something a little less comfortable ? I can hardly wait . Bingo . Mr. Krebs . Did you wash your hands ? No . I was bad . I 'm so glad to hear that . Now close your eyes and turn around . Oops . What the hell ? I wouldn 't do that if I were you , Krebs . Come on , move your ass . Shit . Go ahead , go . You 're not going soft on me , are you ? Okay . You can have him . Good . You 're my last bail-jumper , Krebs . Wake up , sunshine . Please don 't kill me . That was nice kicking . You really know your stuff , babe . What did you call me ? Don 't call me " babe . " God damn it . Ah , Mr. Krebs . It 's a pleasure to see you . You know , we were getting very concerned . And , Barb , it 's a pleasure to see you , too . You 're looking rather buoyant this evening . Shut up . My fee . Ten thousand ... No . The price went up for this one , Schmitz . We had an agreement . You told me Krebs was alone and unarmed . He wasn 't . Sorry . How could I know that ? Bounty hunting is an ugly , unpredictable business . Barb , you of all people should know that . How much ? Twenty thousand . Canadian . Oh , Miss Wire . I do believe that I 'm being extorted here . And as a duly authorized officer of the court , I must protest . Look at it this way , Schmitz . Alive , Krebs represents your investment in his bail bond . Dead , he 's toxic waste . Twenty thousand . Canadian . Now . It 's a pleasure doing business with you , Barb . If it was a pleasure , Schmitz , I 'd charge more . Everything go okay ? Candy from a baby . Pay the help , for God 's sakes . Please , not in public . Excuse me , Miss Wire . Hi , hi . Uh ... I 'm going back to the front lines tomorrow and I was wondering ... You look beautiful . Would you dance with me ? Come on , Barb . Give him a thrill . Come on . I can 't believe I 'm actually dancing with the Barb Wire . Where are you from , soldier ? Steamboat Springs , Colorado , or what 's left of it . Did you hear the Congressionals just took over Denver ? No , I didn 't . Do you have a girl back home ? Yeah . Do you miss her ? Yes , ma 'am , every day . Tell you what . Close your eyes and let 's pretend she 's right here in your arms . Yes , ma 'am . Everyone stay where you are . This is the police . Willis , Steel Harbor 's Chief of Police . He was a drunk with sticky fingers , but at least he was honest . He admitted he was a liar and a thief . Check his ID . Yes , sir . Retinal scan verified . Lawrence Crabtree . 57239 . Ben Jones , eh ? Arrest him . Hey , come on ! Good luck , soldier . Next . Hey ! Retinal scan verified . Arrest her . Willis , what the hell 's going on ? Barb , how lovely to see you . What gives ? It 's a messy business tonight , Miss Wire . Most unpleasant . A rather spectacular double homicide in the old harbor . So ? So we 're checking a few IDs . We have reason to believe this might have been Resistance-related . And as your bar is non-discriminating to this town 's more nefarious side ... How long is this gonna take ? Everything 's negotiable . Curly . Music . You really upgraded this place from what it was , Barb . I like the new sound system . Sounds expensive . I 've been saving my lunch money . I didn 't know you were open for lunch . A little gun-running here , some bail-jumping there , the occasional midnight detonation . Those are the kind of jobs that pay for new toys . I don 't moonlight . I do . It 's very profitable . So what 's with the bullshit arrests this time ? You sold half those fake Congressional IDs yourself . Moi ? Bullshit arrests ? Two of my men are dead . Now , granted , they were homicidal thugs , but nevertheless , they were my men . What makes you think Resistance was involved ? Why ? Do you have any other information I should know about ? Of course not . Mmm . Of course not . Oh , that 's sexual harassment , Chief . Listen , Barbara Kopetski , we could play this little cat-and-mouse game all night long , but I have more important things on my mind . Now , where the hell is William Krebs ? Never heard of him . Why are your men watching him ? That 's classified police business . I can tell you he was Resistance , and the Congressionals have a million-dollar bounty on his head . So if someone knew where Krebs was , I could make it worth their while . Goodbye , Willis . Okay . By the way , Barb , we 're expecting some distinguished visitors tomorrow . A Congressional delegation out of Washington , including First Directorate Colonel Victor Pryzer . Thought I might bring ' em by the Hammerhead . Their money will be welcome . You don 't know Victor Pryzer . Oh , speaking of money , Barb , I don 't have to make anymore arrests tonight for , say , the usual $ 3,000 . Fifteen hundred . Fifteen hundred . Ah ! I think I better go down and start checking some more IDs . Twenty-five hundred . Two grand . Darling . Thirty bucks for the cognac . Add it to my tab , Miss Kopetski . Boom , boom , boom . Miss Kopetski died in the war . I 'm Barb Wire . Cigarettes and a drink and I 'll be fine . Give me a goddamn drink ! You , you or you , just give me my drink . Sir , we 're not open yet . I think you 've had enough already . Ah , blow me . Camille , package check . Get her off ! Get her off of me ! That 's Camille . She works here . Camille , sit . Now , you don 't want to see her roll over , do you ? No , no , no , no . Good . Camille , outside . Have a nice day . Yes , ma 'am . Joe , see if you can get some food down Charlie 's neck . Good luck . Oh , Willis , what 's with the monkey suit ? You know how uniforms impress the Congressionals . The Delegation arrived this morning . Look lively , Barb . They could be here any minute . Excuse me , Barb . My table ? Best in the house , as you requested . Just keep them away from the weapons check , Curly . We don 't want any of our excitable customers from the United Front trying to get even . I think you 'll find our guests from Washington command a bit more respect than that , Barb . I think you 're confusing respect with fear . Speak of the devil . They are punctual , I 'll give ' em that . You 'll join us for a drink later ? On my tab , of course . Fat chance . Colonel Pryzer , Alexander Willis , Director of Police Operations . Welcome to Steel Harbor . Wipe that smile off your face , Willis . This burnt-out hell-hole is the last place on earth I want to be . If it wasn 't for your almost complete incompetence , I wouldn 't be here in the first place , would I ? Yes , well , needless to say , we had intended to have both , Krebs and Cora D , extradited and sent to Washington by now . However , due to circumstances outside of our control ... Listen . Carefully . ... there 's been a slight change of plans here . If Cora D escapes , I will personally rip your heart out of your ass and stuff it back down your throat . That 's not very sanitary . Baby , you tell me it 's late , and I 'm here to tell you , it only feels that way . So sit back and enjoy someone or something illicit if you can get it , and listen to the music . Gentlemen , the steaks are excellent tonight . Ah , Colonel Pryzer , allow me to introduce our hostess , the inimitable ... Even in Washington , we 've heard of Barb Wire . I hope you 'll join us . You attract a very eclectic crowd . It looks that way . Rumor has it that you used to fight with the Resistance . You shouldn 't believe everything you hear . I 'm neutral . I 'm a businesswoman , Colonel . Perhaps we can do business . I can assure you , Barb has a very keen sense of commerce . Then I 'll get to the point . There 's a fugitive , a traitor , in Steel Harbor . She intends to make a crossing into Canada with the help of some of the more disenchanted members of the citizenry . Do I look disenchanted to you ? I 'm sure that your business dealings bring you in contact with all levels of society . I thought you were getting to the point . Her name is Dr. Corrina Devonshire , but you may have heard of her as Cora D. One of those overly romanticized Resistance names . Keeps her legend alive . What does she look like ? We 're not sure . She had her appearance surgically altered . These are photos of her before . Well , I guess it 's hard to find somebody unless you know what she looks like . Her present appearance is of no consequence . Identification can always be made by retinal scanning . So , the Congressionals can count on your assistance ? Excuse me , boss . Trouble in the kitchen . I need you . Excuse me , gentlemen . I have a bar to run . Very interesting woman . With most impressive assets . Gentlemen . Here you are , sir . Act natural ? That 's easier said than done . Yeah , two beers , buddy . I was looking for Barb or Charlie Kopetski . Charlie 's down there . The Congressionals . They have my photographs . Let 's hope Resistance are here . They must be looking everywhere for you . Well , who are we meeting ? Someone I used to know . Wait here . Hello , Charlie . This must be a post-traumatic stress flashback . I could swear I just heard an old voice from the battlefield . Surprised to see me ? Do I look surprised ? Guess you didn 't hear . A Congressional smart grenade . It followed me all the way to my foxhole . I thought I dug it deep enough . I guess I didn 't . I 'm sorry . Yeah . Me , too . Miss , two bourbons . You don 't have to buy me a drink , Axel . I 'm tight with the management , here . You got a lot of nerve coming in here . I had no choice . Where 's Barb ? I don 't think talking to Barb 's gonna be such a good idea . She took Seattle a hell of a lot harder than I did . I need her help , Charlie . I need her to put us in touch with local Resistance . Haven 't you heard ? Barb 's retired . Leave , now , before Barb sees you . There 's no telling what she might do . There he is . Too late . Three , two ... Hello , Barb . ... one . You all right ? Okay , I guess I deserved that . Get out . Look , I need your help . Rot in hell . Yes , I will . But I need your help first . I remember when you believed in something . I remember how I felt , like I was kicked in the stomach . I 'm looking for a man named Krebs and I 've got 24 hours to find him . I don 't even know how I feel . Actually , I don 't feel much of anything anymore . Will you just trust me , please ? Trust you ? Like I did in Seattle ? What happened in Seattle is not what you think . I never wanted to hurt you . And now 's not the time to explain . Well , you 're three years late , Axel . Get out and don 't come back ! Your check , sir . Such blatant disregard for money . Thank you for your hospitality , Citizen Wire . I do hope you 'll think about our offer . I 'm thinking about it . I knew it . I know I shouldn 't have come here . That woman 's in love with you . Cora , there 's quite a lot of things I need to tell you . Well , I hope it 's not too late . Axel , over here . Charlie ? I can help . The blind leading the blind . Go to the old factory district . There 's a place called Steel Harbor Metalworks . It 's a front for the Resistance . There 's a stairway in the back , near the loading dock . Watch yourself . Shit ! Who are you ? Charlie Kopetski sent us . It doesn 't matter who I am , but this is Cora D. Scan ' em . Retinal scan verified . Dr. Corrina Devonshire , 44791 . Cora D , I admire you . We 've been looking for you . I never thought I 'd meet the legend in person . I 'm commander here . They call me Spike . You 're so young . Maybe , but I 'm tough . Well , we 're glad we found you . We hope that you can help us , Spike . It took us a while , but we found Krebs . The lenses are gone , not to mention his eyeballs . We found him in an abandoned washing machine behind the old VA hospital . The Congressionals took the lenses ? They did this ? No , the Congressionals are still looking for Krebs . We know that for sure . Willis and the local cops don 't know squat either . Everybody 's chasing their tail . So who 's got the contact lenses now ? Word on the street is that Krebs was turned over to a bail bondsman named Schmitz . Schmitz was aiming to turn Krebs over to the Congressionals for the million-dollar bounty . Then he got wise to the lenses . Those lenses are worth maybe two million on the black market . Without them , there 's absolutely no way that I 'll be able to get past the retinal scanner checkpoint and get on that plane . Now what are we waiting for ? Let 's get Schmitz . It 's not that easy , Doc . We can 't find him anywhere . That plane for Canada leaves in 24 hours . There must be somebody that can help us out . There 's only one person in Steel Harbor that has connections on all sides . If anybody would know where Schmitz , she would . Trouble is , she won 't help nobody for free and we 're a little low on cash . You know I do . Honey , don 't make me say it . Okay , I love you . Bye . What are you two laughing at ? Who was that ? Your mother . Three . How many ? Put that down ! How many more ? Give me two . Your bet , Moe . Yeah , I 'll bet , when I get ready . You just wait . What the hell ! What 's going on ? Attention ! I don 't know how you do things in Washington , Colonel , but I do make the occasional arrest without slaughter . You incompetent ... We needed to make an interrogation . Sorry , sir . They resisted . Any of these men Schmitz ? Nope . Look who 's here . Krebs . Cora D can 't be far . I 'll need one of the bodies . Preferably one without a head wound . Hey , you want some company ? No . Okay . Do you want some advice ? No . Okay . Drink when you want to remember , Barb . Don 't drink when you want to forget . I 'll be there . I promise . Let 's go ! Barb , we have to go now ! No . He 'll be here . Barb ! Axel ! Are you Barbara Kopetski ? Yes . Where 's Axel ? He 's not here . He 's not coming . He said he 's sorry , but you got to get out of here . You guys got to get out of here . Go , go , go ! That 's it . Come on , let 's go . Come on , get in , get in . You cheated me out of one million bucks , Schmitz . I should blow your head off right now . Lucky for me , you don 't hold a grudge . Don 't I ? A million dollars is pocket change to what 's going down . I got a business proposition for you . You got connections , everyone knows that . I don 't take sides . Exactly . You deal with everybody . I got something to deal . What ? You can 't sell Krebs on your own ? It 's not about Krebs anymore . It 's about retinal contact lenses . They 're smuggled in from Germany . You put these in your eyes , you can get through any retinal scanner , Congressional or U N. I was gonna sell ' em , but my buyer fell through . Krebs was Resistance . Those belong to his friends . Do yourself a favor . Just give 'em back and say you 're sorry . Goddamn it , Barb , I can 't . They 'll kill me , and you know it . The Congressionals broke into my office . They slaughtered everybody . They were looking for me . With or without these , I 'm a dead man . Relax , Schmitz . You can only die once . Barb . I know I double-crossed you . I made a mistake . It happens . I want to trade the lenses . I want to trade them to you . For what ? Get me out of Steel Harbor . Canada , maybe . Just get me out and they 're yours . You want out ? Click your heels together three times . You could sell these . You know how much they 're worth ? You could get two mill Canadian , easy . That 's enough money to get to Europe . You could get one of those neuro-electrical operations for Charlie 's eyes . I don 't buy . I don 't sell . Get out ! You 're gonna regret not dealing with me . You 're gonna regret this very , very much . I 'll add that to my list . The subject is reasonably fresh , but we 'll probably only get a few seconds of readable thought data , Colonel . Cognitive impressions , usually those closest to death first , and then what 's left , memories , dreams . Record it . Yes , sir . Step away from the tank . That 's it ? Here it is in slow-motion , Colonel . Issue a warrant for the arrest of Barb Wire . Issue a warrant ? This isn 't Washington , Pryzer . I need a reason . She 's involved . Yeah , well , you heard what he said . Sometimes all you get are dreams . Well , every man in Steel Harbor dreams about Barb Wire . I need something more conclusive than a bunch of blurry images ... When did the real law ever matter to you ? Miss Wire may know the whereabouts of the retinal contact lenses . We will search her bar . Retinal lenses ? All of this is over a set of Bausch + Lombs ? All of this is over capturing an enemy of the Republic , a traitor named Cora D. If Cora D were to exit this charming free city , your relationship with the Republic would be severely compromised . Painfully compromised . Do I make myself clear ? Mmm-hmm . Your administrative fee should cover the cost of issuing a search warrant . Now , find a reason to search the Hammerhead . As you wish , Colonel . As you wish . I 'm unarmed . How did you get in here ? Where 's my dog ? Hey , I 'm irresistible to females . Thanks , Camille . Towel . What ? Are you gonna shoot me ? Why waste a good bullet ? I thought I told you never to come back . I came here to do a job . The biggest operation I ever signed up for . And I came ready for anything the Congressionals could lob at me . The only thing I wasn 't prepared for was running into you . You 'll get over it . I did . I wouldn 't have come here unless I had to . Oh , I wouldn 't be here if I knew you were coming . Oh , God damn it ! I guess it 's bad timing for both of us . Am I interrupting something ? Lovely , you brought company . Barb , this is my wife , Cora D. How impressive . I 'm sure you 'll have very strong , smart children . Look , I know this is awkward for all of us . And , Barb , you 've got to know , all I ever wanted back in Seattle was to disappear with you and never look back . The war changed that . The war changed everything . Good one . I 'm not surprised you don 't believe me . But , listen , the mission took months and I just thought after all that time , I was just better left a part of your past . Oh , so that 's why I didn 't get an invitation to your wedding ? Barb , there 's more to this story than meets the eye . Do you remember what happened in Topeka , Kansas ? How the whole city was wiped out ? I can explain . I was chief of medical research for the Congressional Directorate . Now , I was directly but unknowingly involved in a globally catastrophic project . An H IV derivative known as " Red Ribbon . " It can kill you in 12 hours . When I learned that Topeka , Kansas , was a lab experiment , and that the Congressionals planned to unleash Red Ribbon on the entire free territories , I defected to the Resistance . It was Axel that helped me get out of Washington . Initially , we married on paper purely for identification purposes . We 've been on the run ever since . How utterly goddamn heroic . Now , what the hell do you want with me ? Cora has the vaccine to Red Ribbon in her system . And the Congressionals want it back . We have to get her to Canada , to tell the Truce Commission there 's a cure to the Congressional 's deadly epidemic . We have to tell the world . Now , we need your help , Barb . The cause needs your help . What has the cause done for me lately ? Barb , where are the contact lenses ? If I knew , you think I 'd tell you ? Look , we know that Schmitz was here last night . Now , if you know where the lenses are ... For Christ 's sake , will you just name a price ! That 's what you do , isn 't it ? Sell yourself to the highest bidder ? I 'm out of your price range . Go ! Is there another way out of here ? Are you kidding ? They 'll have every exit covered . Go in , laddies ! Give me three minutes and meet me downstairs . Why should we trust you ? Maybe you shouldn 't . Check him . Yes , sir . Hey ! Head back . He doesn 't have any retinas , you morons ! Sorry about that , Charlie . We 're not open for breakfast . It 's all very legal . We have a warrant . It 's a little sticky . What exactly are you looking for , Willis ? This is a murder investigation . It 's a Congressional matter . I can assure you , citizen , that if we discover that you 're involved , the consequences will be abrupt and severe . Who are they ? I picked them up on the boulevard . I like a good ménage every now and then . Go out through the back . Scan ' em . This is ridiculous . Commence scan . Malfunction , malfunction . Malfunction , malfunction . Sir , the scanner 's broken , sir . Idiot . You 're wasting my time . Get out . How long is this gonna take ? As long as it takes , citizen . As long as it takes . I wish you could see this mess . I couldn 't see it when it was clean . What the hell were they looking for anyway ? Stupid contact lenses . Oh , yeah ? Schmitz was here last night , trying to trade them for a trip to Canada . I should have done it . Contact lenses ? Yeah . Like these ? What color are they ? The color of money . We can give them to Axel and help them escape . Not so fast . This is our ticket to Europe . Hey , they don 't belong to us . Finders keepers . Hey , I still believe in fighting for what 's right . Oh , cheer up , baby brother . We 're rich . You 're making a mistake , Barb . Tell me that when we get to Paris . A big one . Oh , Charlie , you worry too much . It 's not just about money , you know . I knew Charlie was still friendly with the Resistance , but I didn 't know how friendly . What 's the purpose ? He 's expecting me . Let her through . Big Fatso . How 's the king of the underworld ? Well , well , well . If it isn 't Barb the Buxom . A gesture . Ooh , donuts . I thought I 'd be hearing from you real soon . I have a proposition . Oh , now , ain 't that sweet . But you know I only like big , fat women . A business proposition . As in lenses ? Oh , now don 't give me that surprised look . Like you don 't know what I 'm talking about . You didn 't drive all the way through the heart of the evil empire to see how my diet 's going . You came here to talk about the contact lenses , didn 't you ? I 'm in a position to broker their sale . That 's what I heard . I believe you 've already met ... Mr. Schmitz . Never looked better . Let 's make a deal . Spike ? Anybody ? It 's Charlie . I 'm here . Spike ain 't here . Well , where is she ? She knows I was supposed to meet her here . She sent me instead . Yeah , well , I talk to Spike or I talk to nobody . If the Resistance wants to know where those lenses are , you get me Spike . Coming right down . Spike . Charlie Kopetski . Hold him ! Hey ! You are charged with concealing information regarding the whereabouts of certain pair of contact lenses . You can cooperate and talk to me or you can join your little friend . I 'd rather join my friend . One million Canadian . Deal . I 'm not done yet . There 's a plane I want to catch . It 's at the old airport , on the other side of the unoccupied zone . Ooh , unoccupied zone . Bad part of town . I want safe passage for me and Charlie all the way through the unoccupied zone . That means an escort all the way to the old airport . The zone can be very unpredictable and the toll collectors quite difficult . I 'd have to staff a few more men here , there . How about half a mill , Canadian ? 750 , up front . Deal . You got the lenses ? What do I look , new ? I 'll meet you at the first toll entering the unoccupied zone an hour before sundown . Cash for the lenses , right there . You 're five minutes late , I sell to another buyer . What 's wrong with the damn screen ? It 's not picking up his thoughts . Apparently , Colonel , he has no visual data for that period . God damn it . Where are the lenses ? Speak now , man , or suffer at your leisure . The Easter Bunny took them . I 'll talk . I 'll talk . This guy has them . What guy ? He 's fat , wears a red suit . White beard . Name 's Kringle . Kris Kringle . Merry Christmas ! He was trying to give me just $ 50 . What a mess . Well , this mess is all yours , Curly . The bar 's yours . Get out . I 'm giving it to you . Me and Charlie , we 're history . What do you mean " history " ? You 're leaving forever ? You 're not coming back ? Look , Barb . I have no experience in running a bar . I 'm just a waiter , for Christ 's sake . Oh , Curly , relax . You 're a natural . Camille . Well , this is it . I 'm gonna miss you . I 'm gonna miss you too , Curly . And take care of Camille , okay ? Yeah , right . I never thought I would see the day you 'd drive away in that horrible thing . Where 's Charlie ? He 's supposed to be here . He told me he had to go and see an old friend of his . Someone named Spike . Spike ? Get in . Oh , no ! Oh , God . Charlie ! Oh , my God . What happened ? They 're just kids . What 's that ? Charlie . We heard the Congressionals discovered this place . We were on our way to warn them . Yeah , well , you were too late . Listen to me , Barb , we need your help . There 's no more time . That plane leaves in 90 minutes . You 're the only one who can help us now . Please . For Charlie ? I 'll take care of Charlie . Let 's go . What about the lenses ? They 're safe . She 'll never be able to get on that plane without the contact lenses . Let 's have them . I said they 're safe . Are you coming or not ? Rocket launcher is armed . Does the word " overkill " mean anything to you ? Have you ever tried to drive into Steel Harbor ? No . Then shut up . What 's this ? It 's a road block . On the other side is the unoccupied zone . There 's a toll . You two stay here . What 's going on ? This is our escort . Whoo , look at her ! All gussied up . Ooh , nice jewelry , Barb . You got the money ? No chit-chat ? Have it your way . I said cash . Hey , I had to work fast . It 's a gold debit card with 750,000 credit on it . It 's as good as cash . That wasn 't part of the deal , Big Fatso . I told you , I had to work fast . You got the lenses ? Nice . Hey , watch ' em . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Back off , Axel . Well , well , well . If it isn 't Axel , the freedom fighter and the famous Cora D. We got ourselves a star-studded gathering going on right here , now . How could you ? How many times do I have to tell you ? I don 't take sides . I 'm in this for me only . Right , Big Fatso ? That 's right . And I like the way you think , Barb . The lenses . All right , phase two of the deal . A safe escort to the old airport . Oh , ho , ho . Slight change in plans . You fat son of a bitch . Cover her ! Nice work , Mr. Big Fatso . I 'm the man , I 'm the man , I 'm the man . Barb , I 'm gonna have to ask you to drop your weapons . You 'll love this , Barb . Not only do I get the lenses , but I get a million dollars bounty on your head , and a million dollars bounty on the head of the good doctor for turning you both over to the Congressionals . And not to mention the $ 750,000 credit on the debit card . Don 't you just love it when a plan comes together ? The face may deceive , but the eyes , they never lie . Do they , Dr. Devonshire ? Washington has been in such an uproar since you ran away . I can 't tell you how eager we are to have you back . Whore . Chief Willis , arrest these people . I want you to know I had nothing to do with what happened to Charlie . I 'm sorry . Don 't move ! Look out ! She 's got a grenade ! Take cover ! Floor it ! Hang on . Oh , jeez , we 're gonna die . Oh , God ! Goddamn you , Willis , I 'll break you in half . How am I supposed to get on the plane now ? If we ever get out of this alive , Barb , I 'll kill you . Axel , take the wheel . What ? Don 't argue . Hurry . In an emergency , pull that yellow lever . How come I don 't get to drive ? Second toll , dead ahead . The airport 's just beyond . Here they come ! That 's a bus . We can 't just break through a bus . Does this constitute an emergency ? Yes . Oh , shit ! Hang on . Oh ! What are you doing ? Holy shit ! Hey , wait up ! Give me your gun . Willis , get ' em to the airport . Quick . I 'll stall ' em . No , Barb , you can 't . I 'll meet you at the plane . I promise . Goodbye , Axel . All right , let 's go ! Take Cora to the airport . I 'm going back . Go ! There he is . Get him ! Let 's go . He 's over here . All right , let 's go . Follow him ! Hold your fire ! Where are you , you bastard ? Is this one that makes it go up and down ? Yeah . Yeah , it does . Which one makes it go around ? This one right here . What about this one ? How touching . The last stand of the desperate . Normally , I don 't get emotional about my work , but vaporizing your springy ass is gonna be a real pleasure . Oh , Barb , we 're so close . Don 't you feel the magic ? This is just like my favorite song , I Got You , Babe . Don 't call me " babe . " Attention , attention . Prepare for retinal scan identification . Only UN authorized and identified personnel will be permitted past this point . Infractions will be dealt with severely . Damn , Willis , we 've got to do something . We could create a flamboyant diversion . Thanks . There they are . Are we cutting it close enough ? Put these in . Final seating , Flight 647 . Destination Quebec , gate two . Hold that plane ! Good luck , Doc . Thank you . Destination ? Quebec . Step to the scanner . Retinal scan verified . Citizen approved by all governments . She 's home free . Mission completed . You 're gonna miss your plane . So , I thought Barb Wire never took sides . Keep it to yourself . Last call , Flight 647 . Goodbye , Axel . Goodbye . Willis . Where will you go ? Well , I hear Paris is nice this time of year . I do believe I 'm falling in love . Get in line .

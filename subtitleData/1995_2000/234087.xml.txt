 Three . Give me two . Two . Can I have five cards , please ? Five ? What , are you serious ? Four 's the limit . Let 's see your ace . If Mr. Weems wants five , give him five . [ Dealing Cards ] Dealer takes two . Four . Nah . - How much is that ? - [ Dealer ] Four grand keeps you in ... you and your five shiny new cards . [ Chuckles ] There 's 4,000 . And four more . Let 's make this interesting . I 'm raising you 15 large . I wouldn 't do that . This is all I need . You 're gonna need Depends ... after you see this hand . Now we show each other our cards ? [ Sighs ] Four kings . That 's a straight flush , right ? Beginner 's luck . - What the hell do you think you 're doin ' ? - Going home . No , no . Not so fast . We expect a chance to win some of our money back . Guys , there 's over a hundred thousand dollars here . You 're damn right there 's over a hundred thousand dollars there . A hundred thousand 's all I need . Sorry . I had fun , though . Where can I cash out ? Playing Over Speakers ] Guys , I think we 're going up instead of down . Guys ? Guys , this is not what I meant by " cashing out . " Hey ! Hey ! [ Screaming ] [ Grunts ] - [ Line Ringing ] - [ Mulder ] Hello ? Mulder , it 's me . What now ? - Are you in Chicago ? - Yes , I 'm in Chicago . I 'm on the northeast corner of Seventh and Hunter just like you asked . Only you 're not here . So where are you ? Oh , around . - Yeah ? - Hey , nice outfit . Hey . What 's down there ? Before you check out down there , check out up there . The top two floors are leased to oneJimmy Catrona , - whose name you might be familiar with . - Organized crime . The Bureau 's been trying to build a racketeering case against him the past few years . Gambling , extortion , murder . Which is why last night there were two agents parked across the street in surveillance . They witnessed a man being thrown from Catrona 's roof at 10 : 40 p.m. This man fell 30 floors , plus the distance down this shaft ... because these doors just happened to be open , straight through , nothing but net . - Ouch . - I 'm guessing that 's what he said ... after he got up , climbed out of here and scampered off into the night . - Mulder , you keep saying this man . Who is this man ? - No idea . He got away . The agents gave chase , but no clear description . - Was this basement thoroughly searched ? - No . Technically , falling 300 feet and surviving isn 't a crime . And your theory is ? What if this man had some kind of special capability ... some kind of genetic predisposition towards ... rapid healing or tissue regeneration ? So basically , what we if were looking for Wile E. Coyote ? You 're saying that he 's invulnerable . - Right ? - Yeah . In 1998 , there was a British soldier who plummeted 4,500 feet when his parachute failed . Then he walked away with a broken rib . - What 's your point ? - My point is that if there 's ... a wind gust or a sudden updraft , and plus if he landed in exactly the right way ... I mean , I don 't know . Maybe he just got lucky . What if he got really , really lucky ? That 's your big scientific explanation , Scully ? I mean , how many thousands of variables would have to convene ... - in just the right mixture for that theory to hold water ? - I don 't know . No . Thousands . - Mulder ? - Yeah ? [ Scully ] Look at this . If this cart were on the platform when he hit , that would explain the wheels . And what if this whole thing had just enough give to save his life ? - We 'd have to find him to ask . - Yeah , we 'd have to find him . Looks like maybe we found part of him already . [ Doorbell Buzzing ] I think you 're taking a flier here , Mulder . There 's gotta be at least 600 people with prosthetic eyes in the greater Chicago area . But only this one Henry Weems made an appointment this morning to get a new one . Maybe he can 't see his way to the door . [ Door Opens ] Come on , Scully . I 'm feeling lucky . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Door Opens ] Can you help me ? It 's an emergency . [ Water Spraying ] - Ma 'am , we 're not plumbers . - I didn 't say you were . I just want the damn water turned off so I can go to work . You gotta be stronger than me , right ? Valve 's under the sink . Your building super Henry Weems , he isn 't around ? Mr. Dependable ? Might as well wait forJimmy Hoffa to show up . You 're turning it the wrong way . - Hey , Richie , sweetheart , back in bed . - But , Mom ... Butts are for sitting , and I want yours back in bed . He 's right . Clockwise . I know that . Clockwise . [ Floorboards Creaking ] You okay , Mulder ? Yeah , it 's all right . My ass broke the fall . Guess who I found . Henry Weems , I presume ? Next time leave the plumbing to a professional . Oh , uh ... Oh , uh , you wanna try this on for size , Cinderella ? Mr. Weems , why were you hiding in a vacant apartment ? Not hiding . Avoiding . - Avoiding whom ? - You people . Now that you found me , let 's just get it over with . No way am I testifying againstJimmy Catrona . Last night , Catrona had you thrown off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue . - Is that correct ? - You didn 't hear it from me . I 'm not letting you people move me to Muncie , Indiana to milk cows . More to the point , you survived a 300-foot fall , - essentially unharmed . - [ Flesh Squishing ] I don 't know . Maybe the wind was just right . And I landed on a bunch of towels . No biggie . - You got lucky ? - Yeah , I guess . Except you should look at my bruise . [ Moans ] Plus , I didn 't get to keep my poker winnings . So , that 's what you were doing there last night , playing poker ? Catrona thought I was cheating . I wasn 't . But like I said , you didn 't hear it from me . Must 've been a high-stakes game , I imagine . Did you win a lot of money ? I don 't know . A little . [ Mulder ] What is that ? Did you make it ? Uh-huh . - It 's sort of a hobby . - Mm-hmm . Mind if I ... - Ah . That 's craftsmanship . - Wow . - What does it mean ? - What do you mean what does it mean ? - What 's ... - It doesn 't mean anything . I just sort of ... I don 't know . It 's cause and effect . - So , are ... are we done here ? - [ Scully ] Mr. Weems ? Can I ask you to reconsider testifying against Catrona ? - Nope . No way , Jose . - It would be in your best interest . He 's tried to kill you once , and he will undoubtedly do it again . - Yeah , we can protect you . - I 'll take my chances . So , here 's the plan as I see it . We inform the Chicago field office about Weems , leaving it to them to secure his testimony . You change your clothes , we fly back to D.C. By sunset and all is right with the world . Come on , Scully . Are you gonna dump this case just as it 's getting interesting ? Interesting , Mulder , was when we were looking for Wile E. Coyote . Come on , Mulder . This guy just got lucky . There 's no X-File here . Maybe his luck is the X-File . Stairs . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Oh . Car keys . Must have lost ' em when I fell . - [ Doorbell Buzzing ] - [ Gunshot ] [ Gasps ] So , you get many of these ? Okay . So , uh , they searched the entire building , and there 's no sign of Henry Weems . I 'm guessing that he 's on the run . Our dead man 's name is Angelo Bellini , a.k.a. , Angie the Animal . He 's an enforcer for the Catrona family . And I don 't think his visit was friendly . You think that Weems could have killed him in self-defense ? A skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nicknamed the Animal ? I don 't think so . You and I both know Weems didn 't kill anybody . Besides , we were gone for two minutes . This guy doesn 't have a scratch on him . I 'm thinking it was a heart attack . What the hell happened here , Mulder ? Cause and effect . - Meaning ? - Okay , so watch . So Bellini kicks down the door . [ Karate Grunt ] Poised to kill Weems , right ? But just as he 's about to pull the trigger , a noise startles him . The buzzer when I buzzed to be let back in the apartment . So when he does pull the trigger , his aim is off . Right ? And he hits the lamp ... which falls over and knocks over the ironing board . So as the bullet ricochets , Weems dives over the sofa . Now when Bellini goes for him , he trips over the ironing board , bounces off the chair , flips end-over-end ... and his shoelace gets caught in the fan ... Q.E.D. Cause and effect . Seemingly unrelated and unconnected events and occurrences ... that appear unrelated and random beforehand , but which seem to chain-react in Henry Weems ' favor . - Dumb luck ? - Yeah . He seems to have tapped into it somehow . He won big at poker , he survived getting thrown off a skyscraper , and now this . - Hang on a second . - Okay . Hey , your name 's Richie , right ? - Yeah . - I 'm Dana . - Hi . - Why don 't we , uh , head back to your room . I 'm sure that 's what your mom would want . So , I 'm guessing you 're a sports fan . Which one 's your favorite ? Well , it used to be basketball , but now the Bulls suck , so I think maybe baseball . I like baseball too . Did Henry make this for you ? [ Bell Ringing ] [ Chuckles ] - That 's pretty neat . - Yeah . He made it for me when I was in the hospital . He said it 's ' cause everything happens for a reason . Only just sometimes it 's hard for us to see . You went to the hospital because of your liver ? It doesn 't work so good . - Police looking for Henry ? - Yeah . They just wanna talk to him . Do you have any idea where he might have gone ? Mm-mm . Since I got sick , he hardly ever goes out . - The boy give you any leads ? - He knows nothing . - Mulder , as to your theory , - Mm-hmm ? Why would the world 's most supernaturally lucky man ... work as a building superintendent ? I mean , why doesn 't he just run down to the Illinois State Lottery , enter and , you know , he 'd win automatically ? [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Footsteps ] [ Chuckles ] How you feelin ' , pal ? I 'm okay . The police are lookin for you , though . How come ? Uh , you know . You do folks a favor , wire their joint for free cable ... Don 't worry about it . You gonna be okay by yourself for a while ? Where you goin ' ? Somethin ' I gotta do I 've been puttin ' off . You get some rest . That 's it ? You 've got nothing else ? Okay , thank you . Henry Weems has no police record , I assume . He has no record of any kind , Mulder . He doesn 't earn enough in a year to file tax returns . He has no savings account , no checking account , no insurance . Doesn 't even have a video rental card for that matter . Doesn 't even have a driver 's license . I mean , it 's like he 's intentionally stayed off the radar . He 's retired from the world . Ever since December 1989 . That 's when a commuter jet crashed into Lake Michigan ... carrying 21 passengers . - There was one survivor . - Henry . Yeah . That 's how he lost his eye . Snowy night , Christmas rush . He 'd been bumped from three flights ... before they finally found a seat for him on that fateful plane . - Guess what seat number . - Thirteen ? - Of flight seven . - More good luck you 're saying ? Call it good or bad , but maybe that 's where it all started . What if a brand-new Henry Weems was plucked from the wreckage ... one whose fortunes had been irrevocably permanently changed ? Before 1989 , Henry held down a job for nine years at a train yard . But after the accident , as you said , it 's like he disappeared off the face of the earth . He severed ties with all his friends and moved out to Melrose Park . Mulder , there are millions of reasons for that , including survivor 's guilt . What doesn 't track for me is why Henry Weems would drop off the map ... just because he suddenly became incredibly lucky . What doesn 't track for me is why he 's resurfaced after all these years . Why he suddenly decided to use his luck in this way . - [ Man ] All right , take care of yourself , brother . - Later . Hey , what 's the , uh , lottery up to ? - Twenty-eight million . - I don 't need that much . You don 't need that much ? How much do you need , uh , Rockefeller ? More like a hundred grand . Here goes . One dollar . [ Cash Register Ringing ] [ Scoffs ] These suck . [ Man On TV ] More on this morning 's Melrose Park shooting . Let 's go live to the scene with Megan MacLean . Police have confirmed that a Melrose Park building superintendent ... is wanted for questioning in a case some sources term ... an unusually vicious gangland slaying . You did it ! You won a hundred grand ! - Where do I collect the money ? - Man , they 'll mail it to ya . Eighty-two hundred dollars a month for twelve months . Yeah ! That 's too long . No , please , I wouldn 't do that . Oh , baby ! Oh , sweet baby ! Anything in the trash can is the store 's property . - Yeah , right . In your face ! - Please , no , just throw it away . Something bad is gonna happen . So long , suckers . [ Laughing ] I did it ! I won ! I won the lottery ! A hundred grand , fools ! A hundred grand ! On three . One , two , three . So , let me get this straight . - This is the man who initially won the money ? - Mm-hmm . And once you and he ascertained that the accident victim was still alive , this man fled on foot ? - Mm-hmm . - Okay . After which , the man who was hit by the truck ... handed you the lottery card and said ... " Maurice , I want you to have this . " Mm-hmm . Thank you , Mr. Albert . I think that will be all . Thank you . For such a fortunate man , a lot of unfortunate things happen in Henry Weems ' wake . Maybe that 's part of the package . You can 't have one without the other . So , Mulder , Henry Weems came here to buy a lottery ticket . Why ? Maybe it 's like you said : " Why wouldn 't the luckiest man in the world enter the lottery ? " Actually , that 's exactly what you said ... about an hour after you said it . [ Sighs ] Well , he 's not in his place and he 's not with Richie . You think he hid in there ? He doesn 't hide . He avoids . Well , pretty damn well , I 'd say . That thing must go all over the building , Mulder . I 'll start with the roof if you wanna start with the basement . [ Doorknob Rattling ] Hey ! Hey ! Watch the rough stuff ! - Henry Weems , you 're a hard man to track down . - I 'm workin ' here ! Oh ? You and I are gonna have a talk . - You just sit right here and don 't move , okay ? - Tough guy . [ Floorboards Creaking ] Oh , crap . Not again . - [ Groans ] - [ Grunts ] [ Woman ] Let 's get him up to O.R. Coming through . Excuse us . Does it hurt ? Stings a bit . But I 'll live . Come over here , Henry . I wanna try something . - What 's that about ? - I haven 't a clue . Nine of clubs . You go . - What for ? - I think you know . Oh , you win . Double or nothing . [ Cards Shuffling ] Ooo-hoo ! Tough to beat . - You win again ! - Mulder , what does that prove ? I think it proves if we played this 10,000 times in a row , he would win 10,000 times in a row . He 's incapable of losing . How does it feel to be the luckiest man in the universe , Henry ? It 's a nightmare . You have no idea . No , I do . 'Cause when you get lucky ... really , really lucky ... people around you tend to suffer , is that right ? I think it 's a balance thing . Something good happens to me , then everybody else has to take it in the keister . So you stayed close to home mostly , kept a low profile . But recently you 've been venturing out further . You played poker with mobsters . I figured they could stand the trimming . Bunch of goombah jerks . They got issues , man . You don 't mind so much if a few criminals get hurt , but then you went and you played the lottery . - I don 't ... - I knew I shouldn 't have done that . - I needed the money . - For what ? For Richie , right ? It 's the complications from his hepatitis . He 's on every donor list they got , but ... he 's got a rare blood type ... " B " negative . And he 's ... C.N. Something . C.M.V. Negative ... Cytomegalovirus . There 's no way they 're gonna find a donor in time . There 's a treatment program in England . Hundred grand gets him in . It 's experimental , but ... it 's the best chance he 's got now . - Am I under arrest ? - No . However , you will need protection from Catrona and his men . I 'd say they need protection from me . I 'm sorry , Mulder . That was utterly irresponsible . You 're feeding the delusions of a man who had three attempts made upon his life . You 're supposed to be talking him into protective custody , not out of it . I 'd agree with you if I thought his life was in danger . As it is , he 's doing a betterjob on Catrona 's organization than the F.B.I. I 'm wondering if we shouldn 't make him an honorary agent . [ Scully ] Mulder , you 're putting an astounding amount of faith ... in coincidence and luck . Essentially , you 're betting a man 's life on it . And even if you believe in so-called lucky streaks , you have to know they all eventually end . [ Chuckles ] Luckiest man in the world ? Well , Mulder , I just beat him . - Mulder ? - Come on , Scully . Henry ! - [ Body Thuds ] - [ People Chattering ] - You 're supposed to be resting . - I am resting . Playing on the floor doesn 't count . Don 't you ever get tired of this thing ? Henry said it 's educational . Yeah , well , I don 't want you believing everything that Henry says . Did you know the police are looking for him ? - Henry said it 's no big deal . - When did you see ... Mom , what 's wrong ? How 's he doin ' ? He 's got a bruised rib and a black eye . It certainly could have been worse . And don 't tell me he just got lucky . Far from it . Maybe what you said about streaks is right . Looks like his has just about run its course . I don 't mean to make light of his misfortune , but it may have knocked some sense into his head . He 's agreed to testify against Catrona . - What ? - Our guy from theJustice Department just called . They 're filing a federal warrant this afternoon . - This mook Weems ... - This mook Weems was street pizza last I heard from you . He was . I don 't know what it is . Maybe he has some special ability . He 's impervious or something . Anyway , we can 't get to him . They got cops all over the hospital . Who says we have to get to him ? I want the toy Henry made me , Mom . Can you please go get it ? Uh , sure , honey . - We gotta go . - Richie , I will bring it and I will follow you there . I will meet you at the hospital , okay ? [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Did you find her ? - No . You know Catrona took her . He did it to keep me from testifying . And he 's who we 're focused on . But there 's no sign of a kidnapping , no ransom note . - He 's too smart for that . - It makes it very hard for us to obtain a search warrant . - We 'll get one , though . - When ? Tomorrow ? Next week ? Could someone sit with him at least ? Hold up , Henry . What if what I said before wasn 't true ? That your luck hasn 't changed ? Maybe all this is happening for a reason . So you 're saying that Maggie getting taken is a good thing ? No , I 'm saying that what looks like it might be bad luck may not be bad luck . That we can 't tell yet . We 're not in that position . We can 't see the forest for the trees . How is he ? Not good . If we don 't find a donor in the next few hours ... Scully , what if everybody that becomes involved in Henry Weems ' life ... somehow becomes an integral part of his luck , including you and I ? Mulder , you 're speaking as if we 're all trapped ... in one of those contraptions that he built . - What are you doing ? - Looking for Maggie Lupone . Luck is the overreaching force in this investigation . I say we roll with it . - Yeah . Let 's call that a dry run . - Yeah . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Look who came calling . I wanted to tell you personally that there 's no hard feelings . I 'm not testifying against you . Just let Maggie Lupone go . Maggie ? I don 't know anybody named Maggie . You know anybody named Maggie ? [ Laughing ] Fellas , don 't jerk me around . Jerk you around ? You tried to cheat me out of a hundred large , you kill Angie , you put Sal in the hospital . I 'm jerkin ' you around ? I apologize for my choice of words . Please , just let her go . Her kid 's really sick . I don 't care what happens to me . You 'll care . By the time I 'm finished , you 'll definitely care . Henry ? Richie , how is he ? Not that one . Use the small one . Hey ! Henry ? [ Groaning ] Don 't you hurt him , you son of a bitch ! Shut her up ! [ Grunting ] [ Maggie ] Henry ! [ Gasps ] Oh ! [ Man ] Check downstairs ! [ Mulder ] What are the odds for Catrona being a perfect match ? - A thousand to one ? A million to one ? - Maybe higher . Maybe everything does happen for a reason . Whether we see it or not . Maybe your luck is changing . Maybe . [ Bell Ringing ] [ Child ] I made this !

 You make man ? No- - woman . MONSTER : Woman ? [ THEME MUSIC ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces and bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation- - is it real ? It 's my creation Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive- - alive ! Bang . Bang , bang . [ CHUCKLES ] You think your bullet can harm me ? I 'm Captain Invincible . [ CHUCKLES ] [ ROCK MUSIC ] Hm . Damn sun shower . I don 't believe this . Feel the wrath of the cloud king . I gotta hand it to ya , Lis ' , this remote control cloud is pretty handy . Torturing Chett brings out the artist in me . I push it here- - [ MECHANICAL SOUNDS ] - -it comes down there . [ BEEPING ] [ GROANING ] Aw , what do you want from me ? ! How long do you think it 's gonna take before he gives up and goes to a tanning salon ? This cloud 's a little small . Let 's turn it up . [ BEEPING ] [ THUNDER ] CHETT : Oww ! Uh-oh . What 'd I do ? It 's stuck on Lightning Barrage . Oh , is that bad ? [ THUNDER ] Bad-ish . Lisa , Chett 's about to be French-fried . [ THUNDER ] Do something , anything ! OK , OK . Calm down . [ THUNDER ] [ ELECTRICITY ] [ SHOUTS ] Nice save . Chett ? What a way to go . Why didn 't you save him ? I thought I did . Your parents are going to be really pissed . I know he was mean to me and beat me up , took my things . But he was my only brother . He wasn 't all bad . Uh , Wyatt . I never even told him I loved him . [ GRUNTS ] Now I remember why . I think that 's enough sun for one day . You made him what ? Invincible . You know , just like Captain Invincible . Well , that 's just great , Lisa . Maybe next time , you can turn him into a raptor so he could devour us . Or how about the might Zeus ? Because then , he could smite us with his divine wrath . You asked me to do something , so I did something . You turned a gun-crazy psychotic ugly bully into the Terminator ? Chill out . The spell won 't last forever . And in the meantime , Wyatt 's a dead man . How do you figure ? Whenever Chett is torturing me , my only hope is to get in there with an Indian burn or a nipple twister or a taffy pull , distract him long enough to escape . But if he can 't feel pain , I haven 't got a chance . Taffy pull ? You guys are getting way too stressed over this . Chett will never even notice . [ CAR HORN ] [ CHANTING IN MILITARY RHYTHM ] Sound off . 1 , 2 . Sound off . [ GRUNTING ] [ TRUCK IGNITION STARTS ] [ TIRES SQUEALING ] Somebody stop that truck ! Ah ! [ CLANK ] Pretty close there , huh , pal ? What the hell ? [ GASPS ] I should be dead . This will probably pop right back out . [ GUNFIRE ] [ SCREAMS ] Huh ? Huh ? You know , you gotta work on your aim , lumpy . What 's this ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Whoa . What 's happening to me ? [ WHISTLING ] Electrocuted , run over , shot . It 's as though nothing can hurt me . But that 's impossible . Or is it ? I need some real proof . [ GRUNTS ] [ METAL CLANK ] [ CLANK ] [ CLANK ] [ CLANK ] These accommodations bite . You wanted to spy on Chett . We 're spying on Chett . Yeah . I feel just like James Bond . Whose hand is that ? Sorry . [ LAUGHTER ] I 'm not hemorrhaging . I 'm invincible . [ LIQUID SLOSHING ] [ GLASS BREAKING ] [ LAUGHS ] Ooh , what are you looking at ? [ GLASS BREAKING ] I saw your sister . [ GLASS BREAKING ] I think he suspects . I can 't feel my foot . We 're in big trouble . No , really . It 's all tingly . REPORTER ( ON TV ) : We interrupt our regularly scheduled program for this special report . We have just received word that there has been a thwarted robbery attempt on an armored car . Just what exactly happened during this armored car robbery no one seems to know . But whoever the lone mystery hero is- - Me- - REPORTER ( ON TV ) : - -wherever he may be at this time- -a hero ? REPORTER ( ON TV ) : - -he has the thanks of a most- - Outstanding . REPORTER ( ON TV ) : We now return to our regularly scheduled programming . So Chett actually used his powers for a good cause , kind of like a superhero . We 're just lucky nobody got that superhero 's name . If people found out about Chett 's powers , they might find out about me . [ WHISTLING ] Uh-oh . Well , well , if it isn 't the lipstick twins . Where are you off to , Chett ? Anywhere interesting ? Well , as a matter of fact , I am . You heard about the mystery hero ? It 's me . You stopped a robbery all by yourself ? Something happened to me , something strange . Bullets bounce off me like Captain Invincible . I think it was this lightning bolt that hit me . Weird things happen to people who get hit by lightning . The blind can see . The deaf can hear . The dumb get smart again . Well , you can count on us to keep your little secret . What secret ? I 'm going to tell everyone it was me . I 'm finally getting the respect that I deserve . And you two puke mops are not going to mess it up . We just want to see you get a lot of respect , the kind of respect Captain Invincible gets . OK , Wallace . You got my attention . Superheroes wear capes and masks . That 's what you need to do . You want me to dress in some fruity Spandex ? Me ? [ LAUGHS ] Think about it . Masks make heroes larger than life , thrilling . The more mysterious a hero is , the more people worship ' em . This is stupid . Oh , yeah ? What soldier has a grave and monument all to himself in Washington The Unknown Soldier . The one with the secret identity . Do you think Batman dressed up just because he liked the way the tights felt ? Superheroes get respect , movie deals , supermodel girlfriends . Think of it as a uniform . A uniform , huh ? Hmm . " The Masked Tough Guy . " " Can 't Hurt Him Man . " " The Star-Spangled Avenger . " " The Star-Spangled Avenger Man . " " The Masked Star-Spangled Avenger Man . " No . Where 's the name that says , I 'm the guy to look out for , the name that says , this guy kicks major butt . That 's it !

Maybe you 'd like to try that out on me first . Oh , buzz off , flag boy . [ WOOD CLANKING ] Do me a favor . Tell your friends about me . What are you ? I 'm The Star-Spangled Butt Kicker . ( HIGH-PITCHED ) Star-Spangled Butt Kicker ? I know it 's a mouthful . But I like it . POLICEMAN : He 's on the left-side of the house . [ SIREN SOUNDING ] NEGOTIATOR ( ON MEGAPHONE ) : This is your last warning . Put down your weapons and come out with your hands up . [ GLASS BREAKING ] Come and get us , chumps . [ GUNFIRE , SHOUTING ] We got him . Call in the SWAT team . Is there anything I can do to help , Lieutenant ? I 've already got a house full of armed , escaped convicts . An escaped lunatic I do not need . I 'm here to help . Hey , hey , hey . Wait ! [ HEROIC MUSIC ] [ SHOUTS ] Dunham , make that the SWAT team and the coroner . [ GUNFIRE ] [ SIRENS ] [ HEROIC MUSIC ] I don 't think they 'll be giving you any more problems , Lieutenant . You 're that mystery butt dude , aren 't you ? Just call me a concerned citizen . It 's you boys in blue who are the real heroes . [ CHEERING ] Uh- - wouldn 't happen to have a towel , would you ? You- - you have this body bag ready for you . Much obliged . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] And , sure , everybody can 't grow up to be like the old Star-Spangled Butt Kicker here . But you could all be heroes in your own way . Just be the best citizen you can be . [ APPLAUSE ] Oh , yeah- - and don 't do drugs . Now , who wants autographs ? KIDS : Me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! He comes off like such a dweeb . Why is everyone digging on him ? He 's a hero . You 're not buying into this , take your vitamins and say your prayers , garbage , are you ? I don 't think it 's garbage . Chett has really changed . In the last two weeks , he hasn 't inflicted so much as a wet-willy on me . Maybe you are right . Deep down , maybe Chett really is a good guy . [ TV CONVERSATION ] Whew . Oh , what a day . Dig in , boys . You brought us pizza ? I was over at Casa De Pizza when some hooligan threw a cherry bomb into the toilet . Luckily , I was in a position to smother the blast . The owner was so grateful , he have me a free pie . And you actually thought of us ? Thanks , Chett . This means a lot . Ah , well , I 'm not gonna make a habit of it or anything . It 's just that if the Butt Kicker kept presents for himself , he wouldn 't be a hero , that 's all . Gotcha . [ BEEPING ] Uh-oh . The Butt Signal . POLICEMAN ( ON RADIO ) : Mobile 3 requesting immediate backup to Nation Reserve Bank . We have a hostage situation here . We need a SWAT team and a negotiator . Repeat- - we need immediate- - [ GUNFIRE ] get down ! Get down ! With great power comes great responsibility , which means dinner on the run . [ GRUNTS ] Oh , God . It 's hot . Careful . Oh , ow . Ow ? But he 's invincible . - You don 't think- - That it was the spell wearing off ? No , he just thought he burned his mouth . Right . Yeah , it was psychosomatic . BOTH : Lisa ! [ TIRES SQUEALING ] POLICEMAN : Let 's go , let 's go ! You two back . [ ELECTRICITY ] ( SARCASTIC ) Oh , good . This 'll make us inconspicuous . Yeah , like anyone 's gonna buy Lisa is a SWAT commando . / Hey , Heather Locklear was on " TJ Hooker " for six years , and nobody blinked . This is a crime scene . What are you people doing here ? Told you so . [ CHIMES ] Nothing unusual here . Nothing unusual here . We should go about our business . You should go about your business . These aren 't the droids you 're looking for . These aren 't the droids I 'm looking for . [ HEROIC MUSIC ] [ TIRES SQUEALING ] Lieutenant . Butt Kicker . We 've got hostages in the bank . You know what to do . Where you going ? I think I 'm looking for some droids . Hey , what are you two doing here ? I know , you want to be a hero like your big brother ? I 'm flattered . But it 's dangerous . Run along . Chett , your superpowers are gone . I don 't have time for this . Chett , I 'm serious . The ma- - the lightning wore off . Get out of my way . Aren 't you listening ? You 're not invincible . Oh , I knew it 'd come to this . Your jealous of me . You 've never been second best . You 've always been the good son . You 're going to get the good job . You 're the one Nanna wants to see at Christmas . Well , not anymore . Now you can see how I felt when you potty trained at eight months . Out of my way . [ SIRENS ] Eight months ? Impressive Yeah , yeah . I had a knack . What do we do about Chett ? I 'll zap the bullets out of the robbers ' guns , and nobody will get hurt . Good thinkin ' . [ SCREAMING ] No , you listen to me . You get a helicopter down here , or we 're gonna start- - [ CHETT CLEARING HIS THROAT ] - -tossing bodies out the door . WOMAN HOSTAGE : Don 't hurt me ! Starting with this fruit roll . I 'm sorry , I 'm gonna have to call you back . Any to shoot someone . Look what we have here- - a heaping helping of criminal scum . Bon appetit , fancy pants . Now to get rid of the bullets . Look , guys , " Bewitched " - - [ WOOD BLOCKS ] Pretty impressive , huh ? I really gotta work on my nose wiggling , though . Lisa , pay attention ! [ GUNFIRE ] [ SCREAMING ] [ GUNFIRE ] [ DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [ SHOUTING ] [ LAUGHTER ] Chett ! Speak to me . Looks like this is it . No , Chett . Don 't say that . Come closer . I have something important to tell you . You better not touch my stuff . [ BELCHES ] Lisa , isn 't there something you can do ? I don 't know . I 've never tried bringing someone back to life . Let 's see . [ ELECTRICITY ] [ FAINTS ] Whoa . Took long enough for my superpowers to kick in , didn 't it ? What happened to officer finger-licking good ? Passed out from all the excitement . Well , as soon as I take care of those crooks , I 'll give her mouth-to-mouth . My head feels fluffy . Lisa , he 's going back in . Zap him . LISA : Five more minutes , Mom . You 're not going back in . You 're not invincible ! Uh , who 's gonna stop me ? Me . [ THWACK ] Ow . That hurt , you little pit whiffer . I 'm gonna- - [ GASPS ] Wait a minute . That hurt . That really hurt . You were right . My powers must be gone . I could have gotten killed . Let 's just go home . Yeah , yeah . I- - I guess you 're right . No . No , you guys go . [ GROANS ] What are you talking about ? There are people in there depending on me to save them . Powerless or not , I can 't let them down . I 'm a Marine . I can 't walk away . Sure , you can . It 's easy . I do it all the time . That 's not what a hero would do . Wh- - we- - we shot you . OK , trouser trap , you 've had your fun . It 's time to give it up . How you gonna stop us ? We 've still got all the guns . You talk the talk . But can you walk the walk ? Well , I don 't know about the walk . But I can blast a hole in you wide enough to chuck a monkey . You could do that . Or rather , you could try to do that . But you already shot me- - lots of times . Bullets don 't kill me . That must mean I 'm one bad mother , right ? If you want to be technical , we all sort of shot you . Yeah , right . Anybody tries to shoot me again , I might get real mad . And then you know what I 'd do ? Uh , arrest us ? No way . ( WHISPERING ) You wish . Too easy . Not enough pain involved . See , I got this little pinkie cut . And if you shoot it , that might make my owie worse . That 'd really piss me off . [ COCKS GUN ] It 's gun dropping ' time , boys . POLICEMAN : Go , go , go ! SQUAD LEADER : Blue team , Red team , let 's go . Go , go , go , go . Move , move move . POLICEMAN : Got it . Let 's go . Get down . Nice going , Butt Kicker . I lost my powers . The Butt Kicker 's dead . No way . I 'm proud of you . For what , looking like I escaped from the Elton John 4th of July picnic ? No , for knowing you could have been killed , but still saving all those people . You 're a real hero . Thanks . If you try and hug me , I 'll gut ya . Oh , it 's the bank . Go get me some muffins . Wee . Excuse me , everybody . I 've got an announcement to make . I 'm officially retiring from the superhero game . [ AWING ] No . I 've tried to do my part . But now , it 's time for all of you to do the same . But fear not , for wherever there is injustice , I 'll be there . Wherever there is oppression and tyranny , I 'll be there . Whenever a man raises a fist against his brother , I 'll be there . I thought you said you were retiring . In spirit . I 'll be there in spirit . Moron . All right , get him up . Let 's go . [ APPLAUSE ] NARRATOR : After foiling that daring daylight bank heist , the Star-Spangled Butt Kicker melted back into the shadowy midst whence he came . And while a grateful city slept , the Butt Kicker watched over it , eager to serve mankind , ready to answer the call- - the call of the Butt Signal .

From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

About space , time , the universe . I also have some questions about Nina . What she likes , dislikes And if he would be lingerie model . This is the most incredible I 've seen in my life . - - I could live here . - - It has many rooms . And what you think , Rick ? You do not say much . Well , obviously it is quite Surprisingly , the computers Lines of communication , the means of production . I do not understand that he lacks nothing . Napkins , missing more napkins . - - I 'll put on my shopping list . - - Are you buying ? - - Yes , and the food . - - Go ! - - Go . - - It is surprising to you ? No , it is thought that Nina was that did this . - - No , not Nina kitchen . - - And do not have to do it . And never have to do it . Call me ? No , but since it is here , could clean up my legs ?

Yes , I modeled the following the model of my ex--wife . - - You have designed a rocket ? - - Yes , when I was at NASA . Come on , does the shopping , cooking and designing robots . I suppose I am a nice guy . Speaking of NASA , what happened so that the fired ? Dex was not fired , he resigned . Because the government retained information what he thought should be public . If I ever use that tone with you , ... Hit me . It happened like this : in 1978 two other pilots Proof and I saw a UFO in Utah And I was the only one who admitted be seen publicly . The government denied everything and Dexter was humiliated . He could be the next man on the Moon The first was a failure . - - Neil Armstrong ? - - Neither had personality . And " a great step of man " ? Who has prepared the speech ? Andry Rooney ( TV writer ) - - I think it was Neil 's idea . - - They should have left it on the Moon I read something about which you were involved in ... Lobo incident ? The Incident Wolf Was the biggest lie that the government invented about me . Let this , right , Rick ? Right . How about going out with someone which is not of your species ?

It has been very descortez with our host . Yes , after all he gave us . You 're right , I apologize . I lost my head . My sole purpose from the beginning was that the truth became public . Some do not like that . Wait , that 's the plan ? Alf wants to become public ? Evidently . When people know Alf , he 'll be safe . And do not forget the possibilities market . Truth wants to see that Alf dolls in toy stores ? Since we are stuffed . Do not look good on vinyl . Alf serious about exposing the public ! Yes I expect a call Nigel Neville . Nigel Neville ? That 's Global TV Network ? - - It 's my friend . - - Of course . I want to reserve a space Alf for tomorrow night . A broadcast to the whole world from London . Nigel Nevel live ? Think this is the best way Alf to reveal to the world ? Rick is right , it would be better appear after Baywatch . If you know what , I believe which is a big risk . Put it on a plane , go to London Alf and leave at the mercy of the media . Alf will not take anywhere , the interview is here via satellite . Alf would not put in danger . Do not you feel stupid ? We will go to London on another occasion , doll . Rick , wake up . Alf , you 're doing ?

If you refer to kidnapping a military hostage ? - - There are some speculations . - - I imagine . Listen , Pete Need a favor . - - What is it ? Must enter at the base central database . And give me information on a scandal military called " Incident Wolf . " Wolf ? Sounds familiar . Yes , it happened in 1979 , or maybe in 1980 . - - Okay . How do you connect ? - - You can not .

Well , no jelly . - - Hello , Alf . What is on the table ? - - I like to imagine As a pedestal . The lighting director wants to talk to you . If they do not illuminate well , the camera you can add 9 kg of nose . Learned this from the movies Gerard Depardieu . Dex , can you talk a minute ? I 'll help Alf . - - What happened ? - - With Rick , I knew him ? - - Nothing . - - I 'm worried about him . Besides we are all ... were in this together . I regret that he failed you .

What is " Operation Retribution " ? - - More coffee ? - - No . Yes I 'll take a cup . - - Mr. - - Captain ? Better be taken away . I regret having to come to this because I like you , Melissa .

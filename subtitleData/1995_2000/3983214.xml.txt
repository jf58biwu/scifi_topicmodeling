 Ow ! Look , I 'm all for nature walks , but these mosquitoes are like stealth bombers . Hang tough . We 've got three hours here . I 'll be a few quarts low by then . This way . Grandpa , I 'm scared . You must be brave , Amy . Especially now . No . This is my destiny and duty . And soon it will be yours . Look , are you all right ? I 'm okay . Daddy was right . It didn 't really hurt . My elbow stings from falling down . That 's all . Who was that man ? My grandpa . He was chosen . Just like me . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Are you sure you 're all right ? Come on . Listen , what were you chosen for ? For the good of all the others . Everyone knows that . I 'm Rembrandt . What 's your name ? Rembrandt ? Yeah . I like that name . I 'm Amy . Nice to meet you , Amy . This is Maggie . Hi , Amy . What is it ? I don 't know . Some kind of natural phenomenon . Can you feel that static discharge ? We have to help him . How ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Oh , come on . It 's way too dangerous . Hey , what 's in this pit ? It 's not a pit . It 's the Chasm . Are you sad about what happened to your grandfather , sweetheart ? It 's not that . All right , come on . We 'll take good care of you , all right ? Uh-huh . Don 't worry , Rembrandt . She 'll be fine . Why do you say that ? I don 't know . I feel very strange . I know I should be upset , concerned , but for some reason , I 'm not at all . There 's a kind of peace here . In spite of the way things look . I just have this feeling everything 's going to be all right . Get your balloons . It 's nice , isn 't it ? I don 't know , Q-Ball , I 'm expecting to see Donna Reed or the Beaver . The Beaver is some kind of cultural icon on some worlds . Well , he had his own show . What they mean is , it seems a little too perfect . Afternoon , folks . Lovely day . Sheriff , it 's a good thing that we ran into you . Look , there 's been an accident . Well , Amy . How are you ? Everything go all right ? Yes , Sheriff Hardy . Sheriff , did you hear me ? Her grandfather , he fell into some kind of bottomless pit . So , you folks new in town ? What does that have to do with it ? Enjoy your stay . What 's going on here ? I don 't know , but you 'd think that the man would care more . Oh . Hello , Amy . How nice to see you . And who are these attractive people ? This is Rembrandt . Hello , Rembrandt . Nice to meet you . I haven 't seen you folks around town before . Well , we 're just passing through . Well , I hope that you 'll stay a while . We don 't get so many visitors here in Middletown anymore . Why ? Gosh , I really don 't know . It used to be that Middletown was a real vacation destination , but now it 's just mostly us locals . Oh well , anyway , my name is Mrs. Meadows . And I run a malt shop right around the corner called the Sweet Shack , because " All we speak is sweet , sweet , sweet . " If you need anything just anything at all , just call on me . Thank you very much . We 'll do that . It was very nice meeting you . Listen , can you tell us where we can find Amy 's parents ? Well , I suppose her father is most likely where he usually is at the Temple tending his flock . Drop in and see me , Amy , and I 'll fix you up with a chocolate malt . Now , bye , now . Ooh , what a lovely day . Hello , sweetie , how did it go ? Okay , I guess . There is no power greater than sacrifice , dear heart . The offering fuels the calm . You know that , don 't you ? Yes . Did the transference take place ? Ah , yes . To be among the chosen is to answer the highest calling there is . Well , hello . I 've not seen you before . Who might you be ? I 'd be one of the people who found your daughter here at the edge of a ravine , crying her eyes out . She was hit by what looked to be an electrical force of some kind . She seems okay , physically . But it left her pretty upset . Usually the chosen experiences the transference alone . Why did you break the tradition ? We didn 't know there was a tradition . We were just hiking in the woods , didn 't mean any harm . It 's unusual , but I suppose if everything went all right , there 's no need to worry . Well , I 'm sorry to have to tell you this , but , uh , Amy 's grandfather fell into that chasm thing . Dad was a good man . Fortunate to be called . Shouldn 't we go looking for him ? Form a search party ? The Chasm requires souls . This is how it 's been and always will be . Look , your dad could be terribly hurt , even dead . You don 't care about that ? He was called . He was chosen . As was my wife . Don 't you know the power of sacrifice and redemption ? Not into a pit , I don 't . I 'm afraid I must ask you to leave . No . You 've upset my daughter . Please go . Now . Come on , Remmy . Folks here sure are nice . Yeah . Why ? What are you so paranoid of ? We finally find a pleasant and peaceful world . That should be enough . Popsicles . Yeah , well , it doesn 't look like Amy feels that way . You know , I don 't get you , Q-Ball . We just saw this old man kill himself . His son thinks it 's just great , and you seem to be okay with that . I have this feeling that Amy 's gonna be fine . That everything will work out for her . Quinn Mallory , scientist , objective realist , turned mindless optimist ? Now that 's a picture I never thought I 'd see . Well , just let me know if you 're gonna break into a chorus of " Let It Be . " There 's that feeling again . I should be totally on edge right now , wondering when all this is going to blow up in our faces . But you 're not . I saw a man die , but I don 't sense any danger . Why ? I don 't know , but to be honest , I 'm beginning to feel the same thing . Me , too . Yeah , it 's , uh , not happiness exactly , but ... Content . I don 't remember the last time I felt like this . Maybe when I was a kid back in San Francisco . Well , I 'm happy that everybody is so mellow , but if you don 't mind ... I 'm gonna nose around and see what I can come up about this chasm thing . I think that 's a good idea . But frankly , I think everything 's a good idea right about now . Why don 't you and Colin hang here while Maggie and I go on a little reconnaissance mission ? Hi . Oh , oh , I knew you couldn 't resist it . Two chocolate malts ? Specialty of the house . Absolutely . We can diet on the next world . How are you folks enjoying Middletown ? Fine . We 're just a little thrown by something , though . What 's that ? Well , everyone seems so content . And that throws you ? Well , I know , that it 's a strange thing to complain about , but we 're rather new here . Praise be unto the Chasm . It fills our hearts with peace and contentment . So you 're saying that the Chasm is responsible for everyone feeling so good about themselves ? Yes , dear , if we do right by the Chasm , then It does right by us . We give it a soul , and it gives us back contentment . You give it a soul when someone jumps into the Chasm ? That 's correct . And then when one goes , another who is standing by receives the force through a transference . Yeah , that 's the electrical zap ? The force . And when the melancholy gets too overwhelming , then that person has to make a sacrifice . Then that little girl Amy is next ? Well , you can 't just take , take , take . In order to have peace , you have to pay for it . And I should know . I gave my son , Adam , unto the Chasm . It 's for the common good . You think Amy sees it that way ? It seems as though we ought to try and get inside that chasm . And see if we can find the grandfather . If you want . You have a better idea ? To be honest , Colin , I really don 't have any ideas right now . All I know is that I like it here . Me too . But we have to think of what 's next . I 'm tired of thinking about what 's next . Always on the move , always trying to acclimate to some strange , new world . No home , no friends . A different bed every few days , that 's if there even is a bed . We slide soon . First , I think , we should try to help that little girl . You know , Colin , I 'm not really sure I 'm ever gonna slide again . What ? I 'm burned out , man . I finally find a place that I like . Why leave it ? You don 't mean that , Quinn . Maybe , I do . What about finding our parents ? How do we know they 're even still alive ? Do you want to waste the rest of your life chasing some dream ? Here 's the timer . As for me , I am going to catch a nap . When the time comes , go if you want to go . I think I 've found a new home . Hey . You find anything ? Yeah , that everybody 's as happy as a clam , and the Chasm seems to have everything to do with it . How much time till we slide ? Two hours and 17 minutes . Where 's Q-Ball ? Taking a nap . A nap ? He said he 's home now . He 's through sliding . What ? There 's something seductive about this world . There 's no doubt about it . I can feel the peace myself , but something is wrong . It 's like a drug or something . It 's not real . Whatever it is , Quinn 's more affected by it than we are . Maybe the people with greater stress are more prone to the calming affects of this place . Yeah and it 's getting stronger . By the time the timer counts down to zero , none of us are gonna want to leave . No ! Somebody 's not content . No ! No ! What are you doing here ? You defile this holy place . Do you think a child can accept the burden of the Chasm ? Your mother knew what it meant to give herself . Daddy ! You 'll never be like her . No ! No , Daddy , please ! You will never be the chosen one . No , no , Daddy , don 't ! Amy ? No ! Amy , it 's okay . Amy , Amy . No ! Amy , it 's okay , calm down . Amy , I 'm here . No ! What are you doing here ? I 'm trying to help your daughter . Something 's scaring her to death . Her life is in the hands of something much more powerful than you . Come here , sweetie . Amy , come to Daddy . Come to Daddy , Amy . No ! Amy . No ! Amy ! Amy ! Amy , wait ! Amy ! Amy ! Wait , it 's Rembrandt ! Your friend . Wait ! Amy ! Amy ! Amy ! Amy , no ! Amy ! I am chosen . Listen to me , Remmy . A poisonous force is driving you . I don 't know anymore . I don 't know ! Please , Rembrandt , play it back . It all started with that girl . The girl . Amy . Right , Amy . She was consumed by the same force that has you . I tried to save her . I couldn 't stand to see her so down , so blue . Rembrandt , think back to when you last saw Amy . What 's the use ? Stop it , Remmy ! Now come on , think back . Amy , no ! Get back ! Go ahead , jump . You 'll always be a disappointment to your father . Amy , step back . I am chosen . No ! Amy . Amy . Where is she ? I tried to stop her . My head . She can 't have gone . It 's too soon . I tried to save her . The chosen must serve for years before they are taken . You did this . You and your friends . You don 't know the serenity of our people . Your pain has driven her to this . I told you that I tried to stop her ! A lightning bolt hit me . I couldn 't move . You have taken the transference ? You are chosen ? I don 't want anything to do with this weird cult of death you people have here . It 's too late . You have the sadness , now . It will only deepen , getting darker and darker . Then reverse it ! You don 't understand . You are the chosen . You are to give yourself unto the Chasm . That others shall know peace . Forget it . I 'm not part of this . I 'm not jumping into some black pit . No one can withstand the enveloping sorrow . You will welcome your sacrifice when the time comes . Admit it , you like it here . We 've been through hell and high water looking for our home world . We can 't stop now . Hell , high water , Kromaggs , evil doubles . Thank you , but I think I 'll take all the popcorn and cotton candy I can eat . And the best sleep I 've had in years . Okay , but someone has to suffer and die in order for you to get a good night 's sleep . The way this world works . Remmy . Hey , Rem , what is it ? What happened to you ? Amy ? Is it Amy , did she ... This , too , will pass . You 're not fooling me with your grief , Rembrandt . I know what 's really going on . You spent three months in a Kromagg prison . No one could resist that much mind manipulation . What is it ? He 's just feeling a little stressed . I told you . It 'll pass . Stress like that is too much for any human . That 's why you abandoned Wade . You were working with the Kromaggs . It wasn 't my fault ! Now I didn 't abandon Wade . They took her ! Wade ? What are you talking about ? What happened to Wade , I live with that every day . You . Remmy ? And stop trying to kill me ! You tried to stab me once , and you 'll do it again . That wasn 't me ! That was hypnotic suggestion ! The Kromaggs own you . They control you . Admit it ! No ! Admit it ! You 're one of them . No ! Rem , wait ! Rembrandt ! I 've always carried an aching fear deep inside . A fear that haunts me to the bone . Depression , it can work your soul like a vice-grip , squeezing out happiness , and replacing it with mind-numbing sadness . Until we landed on this world I never knew how lethal that could be . I am chosen ! Don 't do it ! I 'm doing this for everyone else , for their peace of mind . No , think it through . Maybe it 's your time , Rembrandt . Go ahead , take the plunge . You 'll feel better . I 'll decide that for myself , Mallory . You no longer have the free will . You 're a pawn for the Kromagg Dynasties . They 're inside your body , control your every move . That 's why you tried to kill me . That wasn 't the real me . You 're kidding yourself . It 's the only you that exists now . Release yourself from the torment , Remmy . Go ahead . Jump . Jump . It 's the honorable thing to do . Remmy , you 'll die . Don 't do it . I am chosen ! Listen to me . Remmy . Whatever you 're seeing , it isn 't real . It 's this place . This force . It 's infected you . Your head 's spinning with hallucinations . You don 't know , it 's like I can 't catch my breath . Rembrandt , we slide in less than an hour . You have to get it out of you before then , or it could carry with you forever . Slide ? That 's over with now . It is not . No , no , it won 't work . We 're on your side . Then let me do what I must do . Let me give myself to the Chasm . That you might know peace ! No . I am chosen ! He 's dead . Remmy 's dead . I can 't believe that . I won 't . Not until we know for sure . Just face it , there 's only the three of us left . And who knows how long that will last . You have to use all your resources against this thing , Maggie . Every last ounce of your will . Oh , Colin , you don 't know , you can 't feel it . I do know . You have to focus . I feel so dizzy . Sit down . Try to gather your strength . Remmy was a good friend . I 'll miss him . Is that all you have to say ? To be honest , Colin , I really don 't feel that bad . It 's not that I 'm happy about it , but it really doesn 't bother me , either . It just happened . Rem was the best friend you ever had . And you still want to stay here ? Don 't you get it ? You 're so calm because someone else is suffering . First Amy , then Remmy , now Maggie . Where is she ? Maggie ? Get your balloons . Sheriff , Sheriff , we have to talk about something . It 's important . What could possibly be important ? Life is simple . Life is relaxed . Life is good , Reverend , and you help to make it that way . Sheriff , the strangers have been chosen . That 's kind of interesting , isn 't it ? When Amy was taken , the force went into one of them . And now a second one has been chosen . I 've been Sheriff for 23 years . I never once heard of anything like this . You have to do something ! Are they doing anything unusual ? They 've been chosen ! Isn 't that unusual enough ? They 're resistant to the ways of the Chasm . There 's no sense in that . No one can go against the Chasm . What do you plan to do ? We watch them . Close . If they have been chosen , like you say , the Chasm will deal with them . If not , I will . I often feel completely alone in the universe . My husband taken from me , my world and everything in it wiped from existence , it 's like I 'm locked in solitary confinement , serving a life 's sentence behind the walls of my own skin . Quinn doesn 't care about me . I 'm not from his Earth . I 'm not Wade . I 'm just excess baggage he has to drag through the vortex . And Colin 's so busy trying to figure out his new life , he barely even notices me . I 'm all alone . Maggie , wait ! Where 's Colin ? He went back to town . Why are you looking at me like that ? Colin was right . You 're like a magnet for my fear and pains . And as you take on my sorrow , I feel more content . Happier . See , when I move back , your tears stop . And you 're not smiling . Oh , Quinn , I can 't do this alone . You have to help me . You have to figure something out , please . We 'll find a way , Maggie . We 'll get this force out of you . How ? Remmy ! Remmy . I can 't handle it . Let me go . Let me go . Let me go . Okay , okay , look , let 's breathe . You 're not really alone . You have your thoughts . Memories . Remember what Dad used to say , " Courage is 50 % of a fighter pilot 's arsenal . " Not alone , not alone . It 's worse since Steven was killed . Knowing him was the best thing in my life . And now that he 's gone and I 'm so alone ... You 're not alone , Maggie . Quinn , you scared me . I 'm here for you . Always have been . Where are we ? Who cares ? We 're here , and again , maybe we 're not . Quinn , stop doing that , you 're scaring me . Come on , where 's the fun-loving , wisecracking girl I used to know ? Where 's the girl I could have loved ? Almost did . Almost made her mine . Too late . Sorry , I guess you didn 't want to hear that . Quinn , please stop . You are really looking down , Maggie . But I can help . You don 't have to feel so lonely . There is a way out . There is ? How ? Go back to the Chasm . Don 't be afraid . When you feel the wind pick up , spread your arms and dive . It 'll take care of the loneliness . It 'll take care of everything . No , Stop . Stop , Quinn . Quinn , stop . No . Maggie , you 're hallucinating ! This is not real . Quinn ? ... ropes , spikes , you know . Andy says one of the strangers took a bunch of rope , spikes and such . It 's like they were going mountain climbing . There are no mountains around here . Yes , but there 's a Chasm . They can 't do that . It 's against the natural order . There will be terrible consequences . Andy , we 're borrowing some guns . I 'm deputizing you boys . We must maintain the peaceful calm . At all cost . You wanted me to jump into the Chasm . You said it would end my loneliness . That wasn 't me . How do I know this isn 't really you ? Maggie , how can I convince you ? It was awful , you just kept leaving me . I won 't leave you . I promise . I can 't get close to you . We have to stay focused . You don 't care about me . No , you know that 's not true . I can 't get close to you because I give you my depression . I can 't stand this anymore . Maggie , get back here . Please . Rembrandt left , and then Colin left . Rembrandt is in the pit . Colin has not left you . He 's not here . He 'll be back . There 's only one way to end this loneliness . Maggie ! You came back . Why did you come back ? So we can all go inside the Chasm and find Rembrandt . But I need your help . Will you help me ? Why ? Because we are all a part of each other . Wherever you go , I go . I won 't abandon you . You won 't abandon Rembrandt . Search your heart , Maggie . That 's the way it is with us . Thank you . Let 's go see what 's inside . Now remember , we ain 't looking to make friends or take any prisoners . You almost done over there ? One more loop , a turn and there . Where did you learn how to do that ? Brother , necessity is the mother of all fancy knots and harnesses . Only one place to go . You get one ? No . Keep shooting , boys . Take my hand . We go together . That was almost better than sliding . Once you get past the take-off . How much time ? Now you 're going with us ? This place is wearing a little thin . Twelve minutes . Here , why don 't you take it ? Are you all right ? Where are we ? Fairly industrial for holy ground . Come on , let 's go find Rembrandt . Hello . Hello . We 're looking for our friend , Rembrandt . Oh , don 't worry about him . What are you doing down here ? You might say that I am the Keeper of the Flame . You jumped into this thing ? Oh no , no , no , dear . I use the service entrance . Is our friend down here ? In a manner of speaking , he 's crossed over . To what ? To suspended animation . It 's , uh , it 's in the brochure . Middletown 's an amusement park ? One of the happiest places ever . That 's why there 's popcorn and cotton candy everywhere . Exactly . Middletown is the home of the world 's happiest ride . And you are near the end of it . " World 's happiest ride ? " Why does it look like a bottomless pit ? All great leaps of faith look forbidding at first . The faint of heart get discouraged . But the chosen one presses ahead . The chosen one . So the chosen one takes on the weight of the world . Not the world . Just those that live here and benefit from the transmigration of bio-energy . So this transference of emotion is real ? Oh , yeah . All the pain literally goes to the chosen one ? How ? It 's all very scientific . It was invented by my great , great grandfather , a long , long time ago . You see , there is a real transfer through some kind of parallel energy field . We know about transfers of parallel energy fields . What makes it a ride ? That 's how it started a long , long time ago . You see , wealthy people used to come to Middletown and pay dearly to channel their problems through a trained facilitator . And then he was placed into suspended animation , along with the woes and worries of the visitor . And then when the visitor left , their cares were returned to them . But , uh , no one leaves anymore . So this person , this chosen one , he just takes on more and more until no more can be taken ? That 's when they leap into the Chasm . And then they are placed into suspended animation so that the troubles never come back . And then another must be chosen . Nobody ever resists ? They welcome it . It is now your time , dear . She 's not going . I 'm afraid it 's our way . You folks have pushed this thing too far . You and your friend should never have been chosen . But since you were ... Why don 't you take me instead ? I 'm afraid I 'm not at liberty to change ... Or me ? I 'm ready to go . I ... Now take us to our friends . We slide in five minutes , Colin . This it ? Yeah . The chosen ones . How do we get in there ? Only the chosen may enter . Can we turn off the machine ? Release them ? Of course not . I mean , what would we do without the chosen ones to cleanse our souls ? Anyway , the machinery is fully automated . The controls are inside . I 'll go . Only the chosen . It has to be me . You don 't have to do this . I do . I have to get rid of these feelings . Will she freeze right away ? The process takes a few moments . I can turn off the machine from the inside . Here , you better take this . Good luck . Your suspension is about to begin . You will see nothing , feel nothing , know nothing . Remember , your sacrifice brings peace and contentment . Middletown park wishes to say , " Thank you . " Quinn . Quinn , it 's so cold . Hang on , Maggie . The transfer is complete . Now , Maggie ! How are you feeling ? Freezing . Better . How about you ? Worse . Nervous , afraid we 're going to miss the slide , wondering if we did the right thing . The usual . Well , then it worked . Where are we ? On our way out of here . Are you all right ? Yeah . Just cold as hell . A little stiff . I 'm alive . Is this the Chasm ? Yeah . I think so . Pretty weird , huh ? Yeah . Mom ! What did you do ? The people won 't be able to control themselves they 'll be overwhelmed with the highs and lows , with pain , and sorrow . How dare you ? I mean , who are you to come and destroy our lives ? They 'll learn to live with it . Like we all do . Mom ? Adam . Adam . I did what you told me to . I leapt into the Chasm . I didn 't know you 'd be here , too . Were you chosen ? No , Son . I wasn 't chosen . I just came here to be with you . It 's cold in here . Can we go home ? Come on , guys , we gotta go . This is one of those emotional highs she was talking about . We got a minute fifty . Emotion is what makes us human . Yeah , you have to take the bad with the good , the whole package . Well , maybe she has a point . Who are we to pass judgment on other worlds ? We can 't tell people what 's right or wrong . You just get them to look at things from a different perspective . Come on , guys . It 's been a long day . At least you got a nap . Want to go together ? Yeah , why fly solo ? What will they do now ? They 'll have to live with everything . Good and bad . Like we all do .

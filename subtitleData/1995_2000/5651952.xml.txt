 Welcome to Gattaca . You keep your workstation so clean , Jerome . It 's next to godliness . - Isn 't that what they say ? - Godliness . I reviewed your flight plan . Not one error in a million keystrokes . Phenomenal . It 's right that someone like you is taking us to Titan . Has the committee approved the mission ? There 's been talk of delay . You shouldn 't listen to talk . You leave in a week . You 've got a substance test . If you have been notified of a substance analysis please report to the testing center . Jerome . Never shy . Pisses on command . - A beautiful piece of equipment . - You tell me every time I 'm here . Occupational hazard . I see a great many in the course of any given day . Yours just happens to be an exceptional example . Don 't know why my folks didn 't order one like that for me . - Have I ever told you about my son ? - No , you haven 't . Remind me to sometime . So you 're about to go up . One week left . Please tell me you 're the least bit excited . I 'll tell you at the end of the week . Congratulations , Jerome . Thank you . How many launches are there in a day ? A dozen ? Sometimes more . You 're the only one who watches every one of them . If you 're going to pretend like you don 't care , don 't look up . The most unremarkable of events . Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1 st Class , is about to embark on a one-year manned mission to Titan , the 14th moon of Saturn . A highly prestigious assignment . Although , for Jerome selection was virtually guaranteed at birth . He 's blessed with all the gifts required for such an undertaking . A genetic quotient second to none . There 's nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow . Except that I am not Jerome Morrow . I was conceived in the Riviera . Not the French Riviera . The Detroit variety . They used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness . They don 't say that anymore . I 'll never understand why my mother put her faith in God 's hands rather than those of her local geneticist . Ten fingers , 10 toes , that 's all that used to matter . Not now . Only seconds old , the exact time and cause of my death was known . Neurological condition , 60 percent probability . Manic depression , 42 percent probability . Attention deficit disorder , 89 percent probability . Heart disorder : 99 percent probability . Early fatal potential . - Life expectancy : 30.2 years . - Thirty years ? - The name for the certificate ? - Anton . No . Vincent Anton . Yeah . That 's a good name . I know he 'll do something . You 'll do something . Vincent ? I came to think of myself as others thought of me . Chronically ill . Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as if it were life-threatening . The insurance won 't cover it . If he fell ... - But I was told that everything ... - I wish I could do something . Like most other parents of their day , they determined that their next child would be brought into the world in what has become the natural way . Your extracted eggs , Marie have been fertilized with Antonio 's sperm . After screening , we are left , as you see , with two healthy boys and two very healthy girls . Naturally , no critical predispositions to any major inheritable diseases . All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate . We may as well decide on gender . Have you given it any thought ? We would want Vincent to have a brother to play with . - Of course you would . Hello , Vincent . - Hi . You have specified hazel eyes , dark hair and fair skin . I 've taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions : Premature baldness , myopia alcoholism and addictive susceptibility propensity for violence , obesity . We didn 't want diseases , yes . But ... We were just wondering if it 's good to just leave a few things to chance . You want to give your child the best possible start . Believe me , we have enough imperfection built in . Your child doesn 't need any additional burdens . Keep in mind , this child is still you . Simply the best of you . You could conceive naturally 1000 times and never get such a result . That 's how my brother , Anton , came into the world . A son my father considered worthy of his name . - I 'm proud of you , son . - See how much he 's grown . By the time we were playing at blood brothers I understood there was something different flowing through my veins . I 'd need a lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere . Our favorite game was chicken . When our parents weren 't watching we used to swim as far out as we dared . It was about who would get scared and turn back first . Come on , you coward ! Of course it was always me . Anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail . Three hundred million , 350 million , 400 million . Maybe it was my love of the planets or just my dislike for this one but for as long as I remember I 've dreamed of going into space . Seven hundred fifty million , 800 million , 850 million . How many astronauts are there anyway ? I bet I could be one if I wanted . Hey , don 't eat that . It 's Pluto . My goals didn 't change a lot in the intervening years . - Vincent . - Much to my parents ' dismay . Vincent . You have to be realistic . With a heart condition like yours ... Mom , there 's a chance there 's nothing even wrong with my heart . One chance in 100 . - I 'll take it , all right ? - The trouble is , they won 't . Listen , for God 's sake , you gotta understand something . The only way you 'll see the inside of a spaceship is to clean it . My father was right . It didn 't matter how much I lied on my résumé . My real résumé was in my cells . Why should anybody invest all that money to train me when there are a thousand other applicants with a cleaner profile ? Of course it 's illegal to discriminate . " Genoism , " it 's called . But no one takes the law seriously . If you refuse to disclose , they take a sample from a door handle or a handshake . Even the saliva on your application form . If in doubt , a legal drug test can become an illegal peek at your future in the company . Sure you want to do this ? You know you 're gonna lose . It was the last time we swam together . Out into the open sea . Like always , knowing each stroke to the horizon was one we 'd have to make back to the shore . But something was very different about that day . Every time Anton tried to pull away he found me right beside him . Until finally the impossible happened . Vincent ! Vincent ! It was the one moment in our lives that my brother was not as strong as he believed and I was not as weak . It was the moment that made everything else possible . Like many others in my situation I moved around a lot in the next few years , getting work where I could . I must 've cleaned half the toilets in the state . I belonged to a new underclass no longer determined by social status or the color of your skin . Welcome to Gattaca , gentlemen . No , we now have discrimination down to a science . There 's your cleaning material . Start from the front and clean all the way back . I want to see my smiling face on that floor . What about you , Your Majesty ? You 're dreaming of space ? Come here . You can start by cleaning this space right here . I was never more certain of how far away I was from my goal than when I was standing right beside it . When you clean the glass , don 't clean it too well . What do you mean ? You might get ideas . But if the glass is clean , it 'll be easier to see me when I 'm on the other side . For all my brave talk , I knew it was just that . No matter how much I trained or how much I studied the best test score in the world needed the blood test to go with it . I made up my mind to resort to more extreme measures . The man who showed up at my doorstep didn 't exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages . Stand straight . - How did you hear about me ? - People . Any distinguishing marks ? Tattoos , scars , birth marks ? No . I don 't think so . Are you serious about this ? I hope you 're not wasting my time . - I 'd give 100 percent . - That 'll get you halfway there . That 's an old edition , but I know it all by heart . By heart , huh ? You realize the commitment is binding . You have somebody in mind ? For the genetically superior , success is easier to attain but it is by no means guaranteed . After all , there is no gene for fate . And when , for one reason or another a member of the elite falls on hard times their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity . One man 's loss is another man 's gain . His credentials are impeccable . An expiration date you wouldn 't believe . The guy 's practically gonna live forever . He 's got an IQ off the register . Better than 20l20 in both eyes . And the heart of an ox . He could run through a wall . If he could still run . Actually , he was a bigtime swimming star . Vincent , you could go anywhere with this guy 's helix tucked under your arm . What did I tell you ? You look so right together , I wanna double my fee . - We don 't look anything alike . - Close enough . When was the last time anybody looked at a photo ? You could have my face on your nametag , for chrissake . - How do I explain the accident ? - That 's the beautiful thing . It happened out of the country . No one knows he broke his back . As far as anyone 's concerned he 's still a fully productive member of society . Just get him clean and fill in the last year of his life . You 're a foreigner . They don 't care where you were born , just how . Blood has no nationality . As long as it 's got what they want , it 's the only passport you need . - Who lives up there ? - Well , I certainly don 't . So began the process of becoming Jerome . Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth . - Isn 't there another way ? - No . Surgery 's no good . You 'll see the scars . It 's contact lenses or a white cane . - Besides , the color doesn 't match . - He 's right . My eyes are prettier . You understand I take 25 percent of everything you make . If it doesn 't work out , this equipment must be returned within seven days . - And you lose your deposit . - Wait ! You said 20 percent . - Twenty percent . - It 's not negotiable . - I guess that 's it . - Not quite . - Why ? What ? - There 's still the height . - Why ? How tall are you ? - Four-foot-six . How tall were you before the accident ? - His profile says he 's 6 ' 1 " . - I can wear lifts . Even with lifts , you 're not that tall . So what ? No . No . - We never discussed that . - I thought you were serious . I am . I 'm not doing that . I won 't do that . Jerome never questioned my commitment again . I endured the pain by reminding myself that when I did stand up I 'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Do you want to go dancing ? You had to be a right-hander . No one orders southpaws anymore . " Jerome Morrow . " It 's a nice name . - It 's my name . - I can 't be you without it . What makes you think you can be me at all ? Look at this . - Look at it . - It 's nice . I 'm impressed . Is it real ? Are you colorblind too , Vincent ? - It 's silver . - So ? Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium . With all I had going for me , I was still second best . Me . So how do you expect to pull this off ? I don 't know , exactly . Your signature needs work . Soon came time to put our preparations to the test . Jerome had been engineered with everything to get into Gattaca except the desire to do so . - Do you really want to be in there ? - Not in there . Up there . - What 's up there ? - That 's want I want to see , Jerome . Call me Eugene . My middle name . If you 're going to be Jerome , you better start getting used to it . - I gotta go . Where 's my sample ? - In the fridge . Door on the left . - Which pouch ? - Any of them . - You think I should test it ? - lf you like . - What 's wrong with the machine ? - Nothing . You 've been drinking again ! - I haven 't . - Christ , it 's 8 : 00 in the morning ! I haven 't . This is no joke . My interview is in an hour ! There is more vodka in this piss than there is piss ! All right , I 'm sorry . I had half a glass to celebrate . - Friday 's will be okay . - There 's only Wednesday left . Wednesday . That 's the one . Listen , it 's not too late to back out . This is the last day you will be you and I will be me . Well ? - Congratulations . - What about the interview ? That was it . I got it . Of course you got it . And that 's the way it was . Each day I would dispose of as much loose skin , nails and hair as possible . To limit how much of my In-Valid self I 'd leave in the Valid world . At the same time , Eugene prepared samples of his superior body matter so that I might pass for him . Customized urine pouches for the frequent substance tests . Fingertip blood sachets for security checks . And vials filled with other traces . While Eugene supplied me with a new identity , I paid the rent and kept him in the style to which he 'd become accustomed . Eugene never suffered from the routine discrimination of a " utero , " a " faith birth , " or " In-Valid , " as we were called . A " Valid , " a " vitro , " a " made man , " he suffered under a different burden : The burden of perfection . I was now a member of a new and detested segment of society . One of those who refuses to play the hand that he was dealt . I am most commonly known as a " borrowed ladder . " Or a " de-gene-erate . " In the guise of Jerome Morrow I have risen quickly through the ranks of Gattaca . Only one of the mission directors has come close to exposing me . He may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life . - I think we can rule out suicide . - Excuse me , sir ? Nothing . Thank you . This is going to take a while . We may have to push things back . Irene , I want you to assist the investigators . - My work . That would put me behind . - I appreciate your sacrifice , Irene . - I won 't lose my place in line ? - Your place is assured . So kindly inform the authorities we will cooperate in any way although we can 't tolerate a major disruption . - Director ... - Thank you , Irene . Thank you , director . Director , how will this affect the mission ? We 're still going ahead as planned . The launch window is only open until week 's end . Tragic though this event may be it hasn 't stopped the planets turning , has it ? - What happened ? - I 'm going up . When ? - End of the week . - End of the week ? That soon ? What about the mission director ? He 's dead . Are you serious ? They found him beaten so badly they had to check his nametag . You are serious . So that 's it . There 's nothing between us and ignition . I 'm going up . - The man was murdered ? - So ? I didn 't do it . But if he was murdered , the place will be crawling with Hoovers . I 'll take my chances with the J. Edgars over the mission director . What if they do find something ? I 'll be out of their jurisdiction . We have to get drunk immediately . - Good evening , gentlemen . - Good evening . I hear you 're leaving us , Mr. Morrow . - Yeah . Looks that way . - We 're going to miss you . - You 've opened the wine , I hope ? - Of course , sir . - Pour yourself a glass , Cavendish . - Thank you , sir . - How old ? - Me ? This specimen . I kissed him five minutes ago . A real good one . I 'll see what I can do . - You want the full sequence ? - Yes . Thank you . Good luck . Nine-point-three . Quite a catch . Yes . Quite a catch . God , how many times have I told Cavendish ? This can 't have been opened more than five minutes ago ! A wine like this needs to breathe . Remember that . You know , they say when you 're weightless it 's the closest thing to being in the womb . I can 't believe you pulled this off . They 're sending you up there . Up there . You , of all people . You 'll be alone in that room for a year . Don 't think about it . - It 's bigger than your tin can . - What are you gonna do ? I have my books . I go places in my head . - I wish you had company . - I have visitors . None that you don 't pay . - I wouldn 't have it any other way . - Seriously , what are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna finish this . What 's Titan like this time of year ? What 's Titan like ? Titan is exactly like this . All the time , it 's got a cloud around it so thick nobody can tell what 's underneath . - Maybe there 's nothing there . - There 's something there . - You should be going instead of me . - Why is that ? Because up there your legs wouldn 't matter . I 'm scared of heights . I 'm sorry . Do you want this ? I 'll save some for you , shall I ? - I 'm so sorry . I 'm really sorry . - You 're not that sorry . I 'm really , really sorry . Don 't give me a hard time . Give me a break . - Come on ! Come on ! Help ! Help ! - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - I wasn 't drunk . - What do you mean , you 're not drunk ? - When I walked in front of that car . - What car ? I stepped right out in front of it . I 'd never been more sober in my life . - Go to sleep . - I couldn 't even get that right . If at first you don 't succeed , try , try again . Go to sleep . I 'm proud of you , Vincent . You must be drunk to call me Vincent . - How much do you need ? - Twenty minutes . You can go . It 's all right , Irene . You 're excused . We found our man . It 's the only specimen we can 't account for . Every 10 years , things go our way . The eyelash . What do you know about it ? An unregistered In-Valid . A janitor . He disappeared a few years back . - The specimen could be from then . - Nothing lays around here for long . Would a janitor come back after so long to kill a man he never knew ? His profile suggests a violent temperament . If I 'm not mistaken , his profile also suggests he 's a sick man . There 's a 90 percent chance he 's died of natural causes . That leaves a 10 percent chance he 's still alive . Find the man who 's minus an eyelash , we have the murderer . I 'll do a cross-check ... I 've already run it . No record of any living relatives . That 's a damn shame , sir . Check the entry log . Alibis , grudges . I see a lot of dry eyes . The mission director was not universally loved . He was leading cutbacks in the program . With all due respect , sir ... Whatever you say . Jerome , Jerome the metronome . I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his . Mr. Director , you will be pleased to know that we have a suspect . That is a relief . Who is he ? We found an unaccounted-for specimen . Here 's his picture . - An In-Valid . - We 're still following other leads . Be that as it may , I 'm having this posted immediately . I 'm curious , director . An advantage , I should imagine , in your line of work . - Your hiring practices . - Our " recruitment philosophy . " Who do you have to be to be here ? Naturally , our standard is beyond that of the common citizen . You must have varying levels of excellence . Occasionally we 've had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings . But nothing that would prohibit someone from working in a field such as law enforcement , for example . Now , there are enough of the right kind to warrant a new measuring stick . Bodies with minds to match . Essential as we push out further and further . Yet you still monitor performance . - To see they 're meeting their potential . - And exceeding it ? - No one exceeds his potential . - lf he did ? It simply means we didn 't accurately gauge his potential in the first place . - Are you all right , Jerome ? - Terrific . This is the entry log for the last seven days . What about you , Irene ? Do you have an alibi ? - I was alone . - I find that hard to believe . Excuse me . I 'll take care of that for you , Mr. Morrow . I see I 'm not the only one who looks up every time there 's a launch . - Hello , Jerome . - Hello . - It 's awful about the director . - Awful it didn 't happen sooner . Didn 't the director threaten to cancel your mission more than once ? - Yes , he did . - Somebody did you a favor . Do they know whose hand I should be shaking ? They found an eyelash . - Does it have a name ? - Just some In-Valid . Jerome ... I had you sequenced . I read your profile . I 'm sorry . Seems you 're everything they say you are and more . What about you , Irene ? You 're engineered just like the rest of us . Not quite like the rest of you . " Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure . " That 's what the manual says . The only trip I 'll take in space is around the sun on this satellite . If there 's anything wrong with you , I can 't see it from where I stand . If you don 't believe me ... Here . Take it . If you 're still interested , let me know . I 'm sorry . The wind caught it . Please check the latest Gattaca bulletin . Jerome . Is this the approach path we discussed ? - Absolutely , director . - Quite right . Quite right . Listen to what I 'm saying to you , I want what I ordered . It 's a completely different color . No . I 'm bored of talking to you . I 'm bored . I 'll call you back . That was the company that sell us your hair dye . They 've sent me " Summer Wheat " instead of " Honey Dawn . " Any fool knows it 's two shades lighter . She said , " Why don 't you try a change ? " We can 't use a change . - I 'll probably have to pay for it . - We can 't stay here . The idiots I have to deal with . They think I killed the mission director . - What makes them think that ? - They found my eyelash . - Where ? - In the corridor . It could be worse . They could 've found it in your eye . My picture is plastered all over the place . I can 't turn around without seeing my own face . - They 'll recognize me . - They won 't recognize you . - They 'll recognize me . - I don 't recognize you . They won 't marry the eyelash to you . They won 't believe that one of their elite could 've suckered them all this time . No , we do as we planned . You 're Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1 st Class . I 'm not Jerome Morrow . I 'm a murder suspect . What are you doing ? That 's more than a day 's worth ! - We can 't stay here . - Stop that ! Fine . Fine ! Leave if you want . But don 't take that stuff . That stuff is mine ! I could 've rented myself out to somebody with a spine if I 'd known you 'd go belly-up on me at the last fucking gasp . You can 't quit on me now . I 've put too much into this . Do you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself ? Eugene , they are going to find me . You still don 't understand , do you ? When they look at you , they don 't see you anymore . Only me . Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong . How could you be so careless ? - I 'm going out . - Where are you going ? Well , if I 'm gonna get arrested tomorrow , I 'm going out tonight . Are you sure that 's a good idea , to go out ? Well , it was your idea not to change anything . - Who 's going ? - I 'd say everybody . Everybody . If I don 't go , it 'll look suspicious . You don 't want to look suspicious , do you ? Thanks . Who ordered this ? What are we doing here ? I 'm following a lead . Forgive me , but I 'm a detective . I follow leads . What makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here ? He 's an In-Valid , sir . Where do we look but where In-Valids are ? He 's an In-Valid . He 's an In-Valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years . Do you think he 's likely to lie down for us now ? - What would you suggest ? - Go back to the scene . Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca , sweep again . Random stops . - You 're a navigator ? At Gattaca ? - That 's what it says , doesn 't it ? It doesn 't say you 're crippled . I 'm not crippled . I hurt my leg training , you moron . - How dare you question me . - Yeah , right . - What 's your number ? - All right , forget it . - Your number , you fucking flatfoot ! - What do you want ? An apology ? It gets to you that I can do what you can only dream of . I 'm getting off this ball of dirt ! How dare you question me . That 's harassment . My mistake . What 's your number ? What 's your number ? This is a crime scene . What 's this man doing here ? - What are you doing , old man ? - Doing my job , sir . - This is evidence . - But it 's just trash . - You didn 't know ? - Oh , yes . Yeah . Wonderful , wasn 't it ? Twelve fingers or one , it 's how you play . That piece can only be played with 12 . - What 's all this about ? - It 's probably nothing . No . I don 't want to give you a contaminated specimen . Get my meaning ? Thanks . You never know where those swabs have been . I want to show you something . Come on , we 'll miss it . Come on . We 'll miss it . What did I tell you ? - Strange . - What ? Your eyes look different . - I guess it must be the light . - Must be . Positive match . I 'm impressed . The cup was used since the original sweep ? Two samples , two days . Either the suspect returned to the crime scene to get a drink of water . - Or he still works there . - We checked all the service staff . I don 't think he cleans anymore . I think he 's there under false pretenses playing somebody else 's hand . A borrowed ladder at Gattaca ? Far-fetched , but not out of the realm of possibility . It 's hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers . He wouldn 't have the mental faculty or the physical stamina . Maybe you underestimate him . Maybe he is an impostor and maybe the director found out . That could be his motive . I say we sample every employee within the parameters intravenously . That 's two-thirds of their work force . We 'd close them down for days . No , a fingertip or a urine sample . I suggest blood from the vein . I hope I 'm not out of line . It 's only a matter of time , sir . Only a matter of time . What 's with the plungers , Lamar ? You open up a blood bank ? The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my methods may have been compromised . - Goddamn ! Are you out of practice ? - Jerome , I 'm sorry . - Here , let me look at that . - It 's all right . - It 's all right . - Luckily , we have enough . If you need any more , you can always get it off his shoes . Irene . - So you didn 't do it after all ? - I guess somebody beat me to it . I guess . I leave in two days . I guess you know that . But ... That 's the last . - Something 's not right . - He 's not here . It 's a blind alley . No , we missed something . I say we test again . Test ? I cannot allow you to disrupt operations any further . You 're not concerned about having a murderer in your midst ? Right now , your presence is creating more of a threat . The window for our latest launch is open for seven days every 70 years . It 's rather crucial we leave on time . Mission means a great deal to you , doesn 't it ? And your late colleague opposed it , didn 't he ? Take another look at my profile , detective . You won 't find a violent bone in my body . My apologies , director . He won 't trouble you any further . This is not the only place we can look . Okay . Let 's start making the rounds . I 'm luckier than most . Not as lucky as some . - I know something about that . - You , Jerome ? What heart problem did you ever have ? Did you get yours broken once ? I had this crazy idea you were more interested in the murder than me . You 're right . That 's a crazy idea . Would you like to dance ? It 's funny . You work so hard you do everything you can to get away from a place and when you finally get your chance to leave you find a reason to stay . - A year is a long time . - Not so long . Just once around the sun . Hello , everyone . I 'm your detective for the evening . Please don 't leave the premises . Nobody leave ! Am I speaking in some strange foreign language ? Check lenses , dentures , napkins , cigarette butts , saliva off cups . That 's a familiar face . Check him out . - I thought you wanted to dance . - Where are you going ? Just a minute . Jerome ! Jerome ! - Are you insane ? - Come on ! Where did they go ? Come on . Come on . - Don 't you understand I can 't do that ? - You just did . Don 't touch your face . Don 't swallow . Don 't spit . Clean his teeth . Vincent ! Vincent ! Who 's Vincent ? I ... Don 't say anything . Don 't say anything . What happened ? The scars on your legs ? Remember the ' 99 Chrysler LeBaron ? This is the exact height of the front fender . Looked left instead of right . Did you just make that up , or do you use it all the time ? I use it all the time . You had something to do with the director 's death . That 's not true , Irene . Isn 't that the man from last night ? He 's nobody . He 's one of our best . I 'm certain he has nothing to do with this business . Jerome Morrow . You don 't look well , Jerome . Why don 't you go home ? - Can I help you ? - I 'm looking for Jerome Morrow . He 's ill . A little nausea . It 's quite common before a mission . Really ? I ought to pay him a visit . I understand you can show me the way . You don 't know who he is , do you , Irene ? - Hello ? - I need you to be yourself for the day . - I was never very good at it . - The investigators are coming by . - I 'm supposed to be sick . - So you keep telling me . - How long have I got ? - Not long . I guess he 's not home . - Hello ? - I 'm here to see Jerome Morrow . Yes , that 's me . Come up . I guess he 's home . Come in . Come in . Hello , sweetheart . Where 's my kiss ? Good to see you 're feeling better . Of course , now that you 're here . Who 's your friend ? How can I help ? - It 's about the director . - Again ? - I hope it 's no trouble . - No , no . No trouble . - Forgive me for not giving you a tour . - Couldn 't we do this another time ? - This won 't take a moment . - Maybe he can tell me what I 've got . Who were you expecting ? - We have our man . - You have him ? - We have him in custody . - I 'll come right away . - How are you , Jerome ? - Not bad , Jerome . - How the hell did you get up here ? - I could always walk . I 've been faking it . Irene . Irene . Irene . - Don 't touch me ! - Listen to me , Irene . I don 't even know who you are . - I 'm the same person I was yesterday . - No more lies , Jerome . My name is Vincent Anton Freeman . I 'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate , whatever you wanna call it . But I 'm not a murderer . - You 're a God-child ? - We do have one thing in common . Only I don 't have 20 or 30 years left in mine . It 's 10,000 beats overdue . It 's not possible . You are the authority on what is not possible . Aren 't you , Irene ? They 've got you looking so hard for any flaw that after a while that 's all that you see . For whatever it 's worth , I 'm here to tell you that it is possible . It is possible . Congratulations , sir . We did it . His spit was found in the dead director 's eye . While I was busy obsessing about an eyelash your instincts took us in the right direction . So the In-Valid had nothing to do with this ? No , our friend here acted alone . This mission meant everything to him . He knows that if they miss this launch , he won 't live to see the next one . Since nothing can stop the launch now , he 's very , very cooperative . So I imagine you 'll be celebrating tonight , sir . Of course . I think she likes us . Yeah , sure . Just give her a little bit of time . She 'll get used to the idea . What was he like ? - The cop ? - Yeah . - Just a cop . - Did you catch his name ? Actually , my name was the topic . - He 'll be back . - They have their man . It 's over . No , it 's not over . I have to meet him . Vincent ? My God , you have changed . Has it been so long you don 't recognize your own brother ? Are we brothers ? Our parents both died thinking they 'd outlived you . I had my doubts . - What are you doing here , Anton ? - I should ask you that question . I have a right to be here . You don 't . You almost sound as if you believe that . I committed no murder . You must be disappointed . You committed fraud . You 're in trouble . I can get you out of here . Do you have any idea what it took to get in here ? You 've gone as far as you can go . You come with me now . - There 's still a few million miles to go . - It 's over . Is that the only way you can succeed , is to see me fail ? - I 'm telling you ... - God ! Even you are gonna tell me what I can and can 't do now ? In case you haven 't noticed , I don 't need any rescuing . But you did once . Well , you 've got all the answers . How do you explain that ? You didn 't beat me that day . I beat myself . - Who are you trying to convince ? - Do you want me to prove it ? It 's not important , Anton . It 's forgotten . I 'll prove it to you . Do you want me to prove it to you ? I do . Vincent ! Vincent ! Where 's the shore ? We 're too far out ! - You wanna quit ? - We 're too far out . You wanna quit ? No . Vincent ! How are you doing this , Vincent ? How have you done any of this ? We have to go back . It 's too late for that . We 're closer to the other side . What other side ? You want to drown us both ? You wanna know how I did it ? This is how I did it . I never saved anything for the swim back . You couldn 't see , could you ? That night , crossing the street . You crossed anyway . If you 're still interested , let me know . Sorry ... The wind caught it . You 're flying today , aren 't you ? Look at what a mess you 're in . Come on . I have your samples ready . I don 't need any samples where I 'm going . You might when you get back . Everything you need to last you two lifetimes . Why have you done all this ? So Jerome will always be here when you need him . - Where are you going ? - I 'm traveling too . - I don 't know how to thank you . - No , no . I got the better end of the deal . I only lent you my body . You lent me your dream . Not until you 're upstairs . - What is this ? - New policy . - Flight got you nervous ? - Well , there 's a problem , Lamar . I never did tell you about my son , did I ? He 's a big fan of yours . Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most . - He wants to apply here . - I could have gone up and back . And nobody would 've been the wiser . Unfortunately , my son 's not all that they promised . But then , who knows what he could do ? Right ? For future reference , right-handed men don 't hold it with their left . Just one of those things . You 're gonna miss your flight , Vincent . For someone who was never meant for this world , I must confess I 'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it . Of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star . Maybe I 'm not leaving . Maybe I 'm going home .

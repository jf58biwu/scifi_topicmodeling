 Previously on Earth 2 . Advance communications dish launched . If we can average 20 kilometers a day , we can make it to New Pacifica in nine months - or at least what we used to think of as months . It won 't be easy , and I don 't understand this new world better than any of you . But I know New Pacifica is here , and I know somehow we 'll be all right there . Come on ! Okay , hold on . Hold on ! One at a time , please . I did not say this was a bad idea . I was asking : Why didn 't you tell us about this sooner ? Because if Alonzo and I had come to you with this without working ' out all the details , you would have just shot it down . That 's ridiculous . So is this idea . It 's completely harebrained . Wait a minute . Wait a minute ! Hold on , hold on . Scouting ahead , Danziger and I ought to be able to cover 12 kilometers a day . As we reach the limits of our gear , we 'll construct a depot , set up a protected beacon there . We 're setting up a long-range communication network behind us . If we scout further west , it could save us a lot of time once we get these vehicles running again . So , how far ahead are you going to go ? Packing nutritional supplements , we should be good for two months . I 've already spoken to Bess about watching True for me . But going so far ahead - Wouldn 't that be kind of dangerous ? Come on . New Pacifica 's not getting any closer while we sit here . Well , let 's not let cabin fever get the best of us . So far , we 've survived by sticking together . Besides that , traveling by foot , you 're gonna run into snow which is impassible . Well , that 's the other part of the plan . - We built these off of specs we got from Yale 's database . - What are they ? - They 're snowshoes . - Snowshoes ? How do they work ? Come outside , we 'll show you . Hey , Doc . Don 't you want to come see the show ? Yeah . I 'm just gonna grab some cytokines . These things look like an invitation to fractures . Yeah . I told Danziger " No way " the first time he asked me about going on a long-range scout . I just don 't want us to make a rash decision because we 're feeling cooped up here . It could be our best shot at getting to New Pacifica . Yeah , we know how eager you are to get there . Hitch a ride back to the stations . Hey , I 've been thinking about that . Maybe I won 't head back , not right away , unless you 're leaving . No . I 'm sure I 'll be needed when the hospital ship arrives there . And I also thought that maybe New Pacifica might be a nice place to hang out for a while . Oh ! We have some time to figure it out . Sure you don 't wanna come ? Yeah , go on . I 'll catch up . What the - What - This one looks good . No , Uly . This one you peel first . It 's similar to the mango , an Earth variety grown in the tropical regions . But where did it come from in the middle of winter ? The Grendler would not take anything in exchange . The only way I finally got rid of him was to ask him for more . - And it certainly sent him running . - He can run to where this stuff grows ? If he can , we sure camped in the wrong place . - Maybe this 'll answer some questions . - What is it ? - It 's a structural maintenance camera . - Allow me . Oh , my God . It 's our comm dish . ! - The one we released before the crash . Would it have been fitted with a camera ? - What ? Yeah , as standard procedure . Mom , is that New Pacifica ? I think so , Uly . So this Grendler went to New Pacifica and came back ? - And made the journey before this fruit could spoil . - I don 't understand . What does this all mean ? It means , True , that just possibly , New Pacifica is closer than we thought it was . Let 's follow the Grendler 's tracks . Looks like we 're getting close . Yeah . Look . Take cover . Shh . Well , finally . You won 't believe what we found in there . How 'd you beat us here ? We took the ridge . We could see the tracks from up above . Come on . As you can see , Grendlers have definitely been in here , as you can smell . And this ... is what it must have been looking for in my tent . Human blood ? Yeah . What would it want with that ? Hey , look here . Huh . What 's in here ? Careful of those webs . Oh , my gosh-spiders . Can you scan that , Julia ? Watch out ! What the heck was that ? Whatever it was , it was traveling like lightning . It seemed like some kind of energy field . Did you feel its pull ? It was like a ... strong vacuum . Maybe more-maybe an absolute vacuum . What do you mean ? The scanner 's equipped to register near-light speeds . It didn 't track this . What are you getting now ? I 'm getting extreme readings here , like an electromagnetic pull . It 's getting stronger . Watch out ! Think we found the planet 's rapid transit system ? Or something stranger than that . That current was moving so fast . I can 't even get a reading . It 's unreal . This passage may be a time-space fold . Oh , wait a minute . Earlier today our scout was called a wild idea . No , think about it . We 've said before that this planet is a living organism , with a very strong metaphysical plane . So possibly this tunnel could be , what ? Part of a circulatory system ? A means for the planet to transport things ? If it is , we 've been on a slow boat to New Pacifica . That 's for sure . There 's a charge in these webs too . Doc , you may want to stay away from those spiders . You 're right . They don 't look like the friendliest variety . Insects are still one of the few things I haven 't got used to on this planet . Look at these . They 're giving off a strong charge , but I can 't identify it . Look at this . It 's Eden Project . Can you analyze the contents ? What do you got ? High saline concentration . I 'd say it was seawater . Seawater . How far is the nearest coast ? I can 't believe this . If this is a space fold , we could travel hundreds , maybe even thousands of kilometers every day . If we can figure out how to use it . Well , that 's why we 're gonna watch the cave entrance , to see how the Grendlers come and go . As soon as we get these supplies packed , we 'll get back there and relieve those guys . I don 't think we have to worry aboutJulia and Alonzo being alone . - I 'm not worried about ' em . - But it does bother you a bit . What do you mean ? Well , you had to ask Alonzo to go on your long-range scout ? He 's the most logical choice . Or maybe it bothers you that every man in this group isn 't the loner that you are . You 're the only loner in this group , Adair . Looks like a pretty wild ride in there , huh ? I 'm tempted to just jump in and see where the current takes us . What 's that , the flyboy approach ? I guess jumping in goes against all your chromosomes . If you 're gonna just jump into an absolute vacuum , you 'd have to hope that it would put you out pretty quickly , because after about six seconds , biologically , you 'd just explode . Are you flirting with me ? You cold ? Yeah , a little . Are you ? I 'm gonna go start a fire . I don 't - Maybe we shouldn 't . We 'll make it small . I 'll be right back . Oh . There 's no blood in there , if that 's what you 're looking for . What ? What 's wrong ? Are you angry about the fruit ? You-You gave us the fruit . Was that you ? What do you mean , she 's gone ? I mean , gone , disappeared . She went into the time fold . Why would she do that ? I don 't know . I was teasing her about taking risks . Tell him I 'm on my way . Wait , I 'm coming too . Alonzo , don 't do anything until they get there . Devon and Danziger are on their way . Alonzo . Why did you bring me here ? What do you want ? Where are we ? What do you want from me ? What ? What ? What do you want me to do with this ? It 's an empty blood specimen . Yes , I 'm a doctor , but I cannot manufacture blood with this . Thank God you don 't know where blood comes from . I can 't make blood . I need a whole synth lab . Hey , hey ! Stay ! You stay . Stop it ! It 's okay . It 's just a spider . It 's just a spider . Okay . Okay . I 'll make you a batch of blood . But I have to have water . Yeah , I need water . Maybe seawater . Yeah , water . Yeah . Here , little guy . Here , little guy . I need your help . Alonzo , Julia , do you read me ? Alonzo ? I 'm going after ' em . What ? Tell Yale to analyze these - You are not going anywhere . We may have lost two of our crew members to that thing already . You can 't go . There 's only one way to find them . Oh ! Alonzo . Where 'd it take you ? What happened ? Are you okay ? The vacuum takes you so far . It 's like everything stops dead . Then you 're thrown through this empty hole . It ripped the gear right off my head . I need your gear to see ifJulia 's still there . All right . I 'm gonna go with you . Thought you said it was too dangerous . He 's already gone and come back . We gotta go . Julia needs us . All right . I 'm comin ' too . Watch out for the spiders . Whoa ! Ah , geez . John . John , be careful . Come on . Watch out . Someone should wait for Yale . He can figure it out on his own . Okay . Just hold on . Close your eyes . Okay . No , no , no . It 's not ready yet . These things take time . Uh-huh . Okay . Okay . Here . Hah . Oh , my God . Devon ? Alonzo . Devon . Devon ! Alonzo . ! Alonzo ! Are you okay ? Yeah . It 's a beach . I know . New Pacifica ! The Sea of Antaeus . We made it . Where 's Danziger ? I was hoping he was with you . Oh , my God . Hey ! Hey ! Here ! Ah ! Devon ! Alonzo ! Ah , help me . Help me ! Help . ! Danziger ! Danziger ! Damn it , John . Where are you ? - Do you hear him ? - Not Danziger , but when the wind dies down , I 'm getting through toJulia . You are ? Yeah . Alonzo ? Do you read me ? We 're here . We went through the time fold . She must be within range . Just turn on your beacon and we 'll find you . Alonzo , I 'm in a cave . What are you getting ? What are you getting , Alonzo ? She 's close , she 's real close . What direction ? Only a hundred meters away . What direction ? Out there in the water . What ? There must be some kind of underground tunnel . Alonzo , I have no idea where I am . Yeah , a tunnel . Maybe back where we came from . Julia ? Devon , there 's nothing . Are you sure this is where you came out ? Yeah , I got tangled up in these webs . This is so frustrating . She must be close . Don 't - Don 't you worry , Alonzo . We 're gonna find Julia . And you know Danziger can take care ofhimself . Yeah , Mr. Stubborn . He just had to come along . I don 't know what 's wrong with that man . I guess hejust wants to prove himself . I know , I know . He only does it to upset me , I know . If we lost him - Even if we did find our comm dish here , and ... we went back , got all the others , brought them here one by one - I mean , if we actually made it here ... but lost someone - Itjust wouldn 't be New Pacifica withoutJohn . God , I hate to admit how much I 've come to depend on that man . Maybe even more than that . Hey , he 's gonna be okay , Devon . Yeah , it 'll be okay if somebody 'd give me a hand here . ! Come on . Pull . There ya go . You okay ? Almost - Oh , my leg - Ohh ! Danziger ! Danziger , why did you let go ? Let go ? Let go . You pulled my jacket off ! . I did not . Uh ! Oh , watch out . I got stuck in a dead end . There . I couldn 't get back to the current . Oh , man . Thank God you made it . Any word from Julia ? Yeah . We almost made contact . On the beach . Wait a minute . Beach ? Yeah . I think we made it , John . I think we made it to New Pacifica . Come on . Come and see . You ready ? Yeah , always . Alonzo . ! Alonzo ! Hey , guys , it 's Julia . Come on ! She 's safe . ! Come on . ! Julia ! Ahh ! Ohh ! You wouldn 't believe where I 've been . Can 't believe I got here . Still no comm dish . So , how far do you think we 've come ? Oh , maybe 10K . That 's about when we said we 'd turn around . Okay . It was still a successful scout . Why don 't we report back to camp , and we 'll start again tomorrow ? - Yeah , we should get through the fold before sunset . - That 's a good idea . In the hologram , it looked like the comm dish was right on the coast , didn 't it ? Yeah . Okay . Hey , guys ? I hate to bring this up , but New Pacifica 's on the west coast , right ? Yeah , you know that - the Sea of Antaeus . The sun 's moving the wrong way . What ? We 're on the eastern coastline ? There is no eastern coastline for over 6,000 kilometers . Wait a minute . Are you saying that we space-folded ourselves 6,000 kilometers backwards ? Oh , God . We should get back to that tunnel . Come on . Nothing else to be done , so let 's fly . Any pointers for the return ? Just like before - hope and pray . Okay . Everybody , one at a time . You want this ? Nah , you hang on to it . Check your gear . I still cannot believe this . - Right . Oh , my God ! Julia ! What ? It 's on fire ! All right , sit down . Just sit down right here . Julia ! Sit down . - What 's wrong ? - What 's wrong ? Devon . Alonzo . What is it ? Did you see what it was ? What happened ? I don 't know . He was right behind me . I-I - Hold him . He 's going into shock . It looks like a spider bite . The Grendler was only out for a few minutes . Hopefully , humans tolerate the toxins as well . Shh , quiet . You hear that ? The vacuum 's stopped . What ? There 's no current in here at all . Oh , my God . That means we 're stuck here . How is he ? Same . Hey , Julia , could you bring your diaglove over here a second ? Yeah . What is it ? I don 't know . A hunch . Could there be two different kinds of spiders on this web ? Yeah , could be . My diaglove isn 't equipped to do a full bioscan . Why ? What are you thinking ? Well , at both entrances of the tunnel there were these webs , right ? Right . Right and - and both gave off a strong electromagnetic charge . Yeah . Well , now , what if the webs somehow cause that current in there ? I don 't know . It 's your field . I 'm just tryin ' to think of somethin ' . No , you might be onto something . I mean , it is possible that these webs set up some sort of force field . - But this one seems quite benign . - Hey , guys , he 's coming to . Alonzo , can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? Devon . Yeah , I 'm right here . Oh , thank goodness . Do you remember what happened ? You were bit by a spider . It was worth it . Pal , we 're gonna get you back home as soon as we can . I don 't want to go anywhere as long as you 're here . Hey , steady there . - Hey , Alonzo , come on ! - He 's groggy . Yeah , I think he 's delirious . Alonzo - I almost died . I felt myself going . Something pulled me back in . It was you , Devon . It was you . I 'm , uh , gonna get some water . Maybe dousing him will cool him off . Yeah . I think that 's , um - Just don 't go . Look , Alonzo , just stay put . Watch him , okay ? - Don 't go . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Come back here ! Hey , take it easy . Stay right here , lover boy . She 'll be back . Hey . Hey , come on . Oh , don 't be silly . It 's obviously just ... part of the toxic reaction . Devon - If I didn 't know you were skewed against it , I would say you 're having an emotionally charged reaction , Dr. Heller . I 'm fine . Good . It 's not crazy , John . It 's what happens sometimes . One look and everything changes . I mean , you know that , right ? What aboutJulia ? I am telling you . It 's like I saw Devon for the first time . Okay , take it easy . Now , Alonzo 's reaction - What-What do you think it is ? The Grendler that you tricked - he didn 't respond in this way , did he ? No . No , it was the complete opposite . He - It was the complete opposite . There 's another part of her too - the part of her that she tries to keep hidden . I mean , there 's a woman who 's all loving and giving . You wanna give it a rest ? A woman who should be held and caressed . That 's enough . Passionate . Fiery . I just want to reach her . - What happened ? - Uh - Crud . He , uh , had a relapse . You hit him ? What ? Are you okay , Julia ? Well , guess we found the antidote to a spider bite . Oh , come on . A punch can reverse a toxic reaction ? Unless it 's not a chemical poison . It 's a toxin that affects force fields - attractions and repulsions . Wait , you mean magnetic fields ? Well , maybe . But maybe a force that - that affects personal and emotional attractions . Science has never been able to name or explain it . But this planet , again , with its strong metaphysical plane , suggests a possible connection . Whatever she 's saying , I agree . I think there are two varieties of spiders in this web . Yeah ? And they 're polar opposites , and that 's why their two bites cause such extreme reactions . Their opposing biologies create these webs with strong oppositional fields . Okay , opposites attract . But why would that shut down the current ? I don 't know . Maybe - Maybe it 's our fault . Maybe we brought a spider from the first tunnel with us when we came through the fold . What if we did ? If the positive and the negative , so to speak , meet each other , then this neutralizes the current . Then we have to get the foreign spider out of this web . Yeah . How do we find it ? I 'd volunteer to be bitten again , but I don 't know if I can take it . I have an idea . Hello ? Hello , are you here ? I have a spider that wants to meet you . It 's right behind me . Here . Easy . Easy now . Oh , good . It 's you . I think he 'll do anything I say . Looks like it 's already been bitten . Which explains his attraction to me . Come on . We 're gonna sit right here . Sit right ... here . Down . Okay . Ready for the test . Here comes bite number one . Oh , my God . Okay , negative . that one belongs here . Hang on . Here 's another one . That 's negative too . I hope we 're not gonna kill him . No . No , he 's fine . He 's just getting very sleepy . There 's another one right here . That 's it . That 's the one . Grab it . I hear a train comin ' . Yes ! It worked ! Next train . You 'll feel so much better ... when you wake up . Put him over here . Okay , ladies . Let 's get ready to go home . I just need one minute . I really thought that we made it . Still , it 's a beautiful place . I 'm glad New Pacifica 's on the coastline . That 'll be nice . We still have a very long way to go . Yeah . It won 't be so bad getting there . Better get back . Huh ! We 're back . We made it . They 're back . ! It brought them back . ! Julia ! Hey . Hey , hey . ! Hey , what happened ? Where 's my dad ? He 's right behind us . Good to see you back . It really is . Thanks . Devon , Danziger . ! Dad . ! Hey . Hey , sweetie . Dad ! Hi . Uly ! Ooh ! Did you find New Pacifica ? No . No , we went the wrong way , Uly . What about the comm dish ? Must 've been on the wrong track . Yeah , the only thing we know for sure is we 're glad to be back . We 're all gonna stay together , even if it means a long winter here . - That 's for sure . - I love you , Mom . Hey , you wouldn 't believe how much water we saw . You turn around and all you could see was water . All right , buddy . There you go . Come on . Come on . Almost forgot . Now he 's back where he belongs . Can 't help but feel sorry for it . So much attraction reaching across such a distance to find its opposite . It 's hard to imagine . No , it 's not .

 [ Cell Phone Beeping ] - [ Rings , Beeps ] - This is Sydney . [ Jarod ] It 's incredible how beautiful Yellowstone is . - Even from 12,000 feet . - I can barely hear you . I 'm going through a little turbulence . - Speaking of black clouds , is Miss Parker around ? - Hasn 't arrived yet . - Well , it 's very important that I speak with her . - Sounds mysterious . I 'm on my way to meet someone that was very close to her mother . - Someone who can answer a lot of questions . - [ Engine Pops , Sputters ] Jarod , is something wrong ? I 'm fine , but my engine doesn 't appear to be . Listen , Sydney . I don 't have much time . - Did the package come that I sent for Miss Parker ? - It arrived early this morning . - See that she gets it . - Don 't worry . I 'll take care of it . - If you don 't talk to me in one hour - - [ Engine Sputters ] - [ Beeps ] - [ Whispers ] Jarod . [ Beeps ] Come on , baby . Don 't fail on me now . [ Sputtering ] - [ Applause On TV ] - Make with the hot stuff , stranger boy . [ Broots Laughing ] Hmm . [ Laughs ] [ Broots Laughing ] - Home movies , Broots ? - [ Clears Throat ] Miss Parker . - [ Chuckles ] Good morning . - What 's good about it , Cheetah ? Well , uh - Are you okay ? Just peachy . Thomas is out of town for another week . Last time I checked , my father was still in Cabo with that troll . And if that 's not enough torment , he left Raines in charge of this nuthouse . Speaking of which , just what the hell are you two doing ? Oh , uh - [ Chuckles ] It 's therapy . Sydney 's hoping that a little cognitive stimulation ... might improve Angelo 's expressive abilities . Well , it certainly seems to be working for the monkeys . Oh , Miss Parker . - You wanted to see me , Dr. Dolittle ? - You okay ? I 'm fine . Geez . You get a little gas , and people think you 're dying . Seems like you 've had a great deal of indigestion lately . Well , what do you expect ? I work with you three . [ Man On TV ] Right then and there . And it sure made a happy gal out of Fanny ... and made a big hero out of the Lonesome Stranger . Hi-ho , Plastic . [ Whinnies ] Oh , for God 's sake . What do you want , Sydney ? It 's from Jarod to you . Probably another twisted attempt to ... rub my face in my twisted dysfunctional family life . [ Broots ] A rosary ? Miss Parker has pain . - Parker , are you okay ? - Sydney . Hang on . Oh , God . Miss Parker ! Miss Parker ! Parker . Parker , can you hear me ? Syd , she was just standing there , and then - and then she just fell . - Oh , my God . She 's burning up . - She 's going into shock . - We 've got to get her to a hospital now . - Okay . Help ! We need help . Somebody call 911 . Miss Parker needs faith ... but faith is dead . Miss Parker needs faith , but faith is dead . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is 2 - niner Charlie Victor . Over . - [ Man ] What 's your problem , Charlie Victor ? - I 've lost all power . - And I 'm descending rapidly . - Charlie Victor , what 's your location ? Over . Charlie Victor , do you read me ? Over . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Grunting ] [ Woman 's Voice ] B.P. ' s 70 over 40 and falling . Pulse 110 and thready . Pupils dilated and unresponsive . O saturation , 78 . Respiration shallow at 40 . She needs plasma , O-neg - lots of it . I want a C.B.C. , blood gases , the works . You 're a doctor , right ? - Psychiatrist . - What the hell happened ? [ Sighs ] She was experiencing abdominal pain . Then she just collapsed . She has a history of ulcers . And she 's been under a lot of stress . She appears to have massive internal bleeding . Probably a perforated ulcer . - Well , will she be okay ? - It 's too early to tell . Excuse me . Alert O.R. To prepare for surgery . [ Sydney ] Broots , I 've got to get back to the Centre . - You 're leaving now , Syd ? - Jarod 's supposed to call . - Jarod ? - I 'll explain later . Stay here and monitor her condition . I 'll be back . Okay . I 'm not goin ' anywhere . [ Man ] " Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ... I will fear no evil , for thou art with me . " [ Speaking Spanish ] Amen . The valley of the shadow of death . The shadow of death . The shadow of death . [ Echoes ] Jarod , can you keep a secret ? I guess so , Miss Parker . What is it ? There 's a dead body in the Centre . A dead body ? Where is it ? I saw them deliver the coffin this morning to Dr. Raines . He told them to take it to the containment area . Yeah . I 've heard Sydney talk about that place . They do a lot of special projects down there , but they 've never taken me there . - I don 't even know where it is . - Me either . I asked my daddy about the coffin and the body , but ... he wouldn 't talk about it . For the last few weeks - well , since Mommy died - he 's been too busy to talk to me about anything . I still can 't believe she 's really gone . I 'm sorry about your mother . I 'm okay . Anyway , if Dad won 't tell me where the body is , then I 'll just find it on my own . If you could follow Dr. Raines without him knowing it , he 'd lead you straight to it . - Well , come on then . Let 's go find him . - I didn 't say I would do it . - You 're not scared , are you ? - No . It 's just ... I 've never seen anyone who was dead before . They can 't hurt you - anymore . I 'm more afraid of Dr. Raines . I hate doctors . She 's lost a lot of blood . The pressure 's almost undetectable . - We don 't have much time . - [ Woman ] She 's prepped for abdominal entry . - Are you ready ? - She 's out . Let 's start . - This one 's gonna need a miracle to survive . - [ Machine Beeping ] [ Groaning ] [ Groaning ] Ow . [ Grunts ] - [ Crack ] - [ Screams ] [ Panting ] [ Grunting ] [ Groaning , Coughs ] [ Young Jarod 's Voice ] I wonder what it 's like to die . Ask Raines . Looks like he died a long time ago . Come on . Let 's go find the dead guy . It 's weird . Death is something that everyone experiences ... but no one wants to talk about it . Yeah . When my mom died ... all the grown-ups would come up and talk to me ... about anything except what I wanted to talk about . About what happened to her . He went this way . So when we find the coffin , then what ? We open it . I wonder what it 'll look like . What if it was someone who was mutilated in a wreck or - or killed in a sim ? Or maybe it was someone the Centre wanted to get rid of . Maybe Dr. Raines created some kind of monster , like Frankenstein . - Who 's Frankenstein ? - [ Door Opens ] He 's coming back . Come on . - There 's nowhere to hide . What do we do ? - I don 't know . - [ Doorknob Rattles ] - Who 's in there ? - [ Young Miss Parker ] Thanks , Angelo . - Faith is waiting . That was too close . Don 't wet your pants , Jarod . You look like you 're gonna pass out or something . [ Soft Growl , Panting ] [ Growls ] Perfect . - Get out of here ! - [ Rock Rattles ] Hello . Can anybody read me ? This is an emergency . Hello . Over . This is Montana Air Patrol . Please respond . This is 2-niner Charlie Victor . My engine stalled , and I 've crashed ... into a - a river or an inlet . - I need some help . - Are you hurt ? Over . I have multiple lacerations . I dislocated my shoulder ... and I think I 've broken a couple of ribs . - [ Mouthing Words ] - I 'm stable for now , but I could use some medical help . Roger that . Are there any other survivors ? Over . - No . I 'm alone . - [ Static ] Hello . Hello . Can you hear me , air patrol ? Over . Hello . - Hello . - This is air patrol . I 'm losing your signal . There 's a cold front coming in . We need your exact location . - Respond . - I 'm not sure . I was about two hours outside of ... Casper . I was heading northwest . I 'm about 30 miles from - Thirty miles from where ? Charlie Victor , I 'm losing you . Hello . Hello . Please respond , Charlie Victor . - I lost him . - Probably for good . Nobody can survive a night out there . No one . [ Jarod ] Hello . Can you hear me ? Over . [ Grunts ] Can anybody hear me ? [ Echoes ] Hello ! [ Echoes ] Can anybody hear me ? [ Echoes ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] - Jarod ? - No , it 's Broots . - I 'm here at the hospital . What 's goin ' on ? - Jarod never called . - It 's not like him . How 's Miss Parker ? - I don 't know . They just brought her out of surgery . They 're getting her settled into I.C.U. I want to go in there , but they 're not letting anyone see her yet . She shouldn 't be alone in there , Syd . Stay put , Broots . I 'm heading back there right away . - Okay . - [ Beeps ] No one should be alone at a time like this . [ Wolf Howls ] [ Owl Hoots ] Come on . Damn it . [ Grunts ] Come on . Come on . Please light . Come on . Don 't go out on me . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Chattering ] [ Beeping Continues ] You look so cold . It 's so strange , what with you givin ' me a hard time all the time . But I know you don 't mean it . I know it 's just your way . You 've always been there for me . Whenever I needed someone , it was you . And you probably can 't even hear me . But I just want you to know ... that , other than Debbie ... I feel closer to you ... than to anyone . Miss Parker ... you know , you - you can 't leave me . Miss Parker . [ Moans Softly ] - Don 't be afraid . - [ Moans Softly ] - [ Moans ] - Don 't be afraid , Miss Parker . - [ Young Jarod ] Don 't be afraid , Miss Parker . - [ Young Miss Parker ] Afraid ? I 'm not afraid . I just want to know where the hell we 're going . M-M-Miss Parker needs faith . We don 't need faith , Angelo . We have to find the body . [ Young Jarod ] Look . That must be it . What is it ? It 's where they 're keeping the body . Faith . [ Young Jarod ] It feels strange to be here . [ Young Miss Parker ] Maybe we shouldn 't be . [ Young Miss Parker ] Come on . Let 's get out ofhere . We 've come this far . What 's wrong ? [ Young Miss Parker ] Nothing . It reminds me of m - Never mind . [ Young Jarod ] But I thought you wanted to see it . [ Young Miss Parker ] I do . This just isn 't the right time . - Are you afraid ? - I don 't know . Come on . [ Wolf Whining ] You hungry ? Well , so am I. So , you 're just gonna have to wait a little longer for me . - [ Shouts ] - [ Growls ] No . [ Machine Beeping ] Sydney . - [ Sydney ] How is she ? - [ Broots ] Well , she lost a lot ofblood . Her fever 's over 102 . The doctor says she 's developed peritonitis , whatever the hell that is . It 's bad . They said she - that she might not make it . I wish there was something I could do . [ Whispers ] You 're already doing it , Broots . Sorry , guys . Gotta ask you to leave now . - It 's real important she gets her rest . - Okay . Faith . [ Moans ] Faith . Shh . It 's okay . It 's okay . [ Miss Parker Moans Softly ] Faith . [ Woman On P.A. ] Wheelchair , 412 . She keeps saying something about faith . That 's what Angelo said - in the sim lab when he saw the rosary thatJarod sent her . Right before she collapsed . - What do you think it means ? - I 'm not sure . But I seem to remember there was a project - long time ago - which was code-named Faith . - We need to get back to the Centre . - Now ? I believeJarod was in a plane crash . - What ? - I need you to try and figure out where he might have gone down . - Nurse . - Yes . If her condition changes - I have all your numbers . I 'll contact you immediately . There isn 't much you can do here anyway . - It 's all up to her now . - Thank you . Faith . I have to find ... faith . It 's - It 's a girl . She 's beautiful . [ Murmurs ] - You 're not dead . - Neither are you . Yeah . It 's just ... we - Never mind . My name is Miss Parker . Kind of formal , isn 't it ? Hi . I 'm Faith . - Hi . - I 'm Jarod . - And , uh , this is Angelo . He doesn 't talk much . - Hi . - [ Young Jarod ] What are you doin 'down here ? - Oh , I 've been sick . Really , really sick . They brought me here to get well . I 've never seen other children in this place . Yeah . They live here . I 'm here with my dad . He works here . But , as it turns out , I 'm usually alone . I 'm used to being by myself too . But I 'm not alone now . Maybe we could play together . You know , be friends . I 'd like that . - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Bad . - We gotta get out of here . - We 're not supposed to be here . We 'll get in a lot of trouble . - I won 't tell anyone . I promise . - Okay . - We gotta go now . But we 'll be back , okay ? - Okay . - Come on . - I 'll be back . Bye . I 'm not going anywhere . Close . You know , I 've never had a friend before . I mean , a girlfriend . I can 't wait for Faith to get well so we can play together . Faith , uh , isn 't just sick . She 's very sick . What do you mean ? I read her chart , and she 's - she 's not gonna make it . But ... I don 't want her to die . I don 't want anyone to die . I don 't want her to die . [ Echoes ] I don 't want anyone to die . [ Echoes ] [ Angelo ] Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen . Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen . - Hail Mary , full of Grace , the Lord is with thee . - [ Steady Beep ] Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen . [ Girl Giggling ] [ Giggling ] [ Faith ] Hi , Jarod . [ Steady Beep ] [ Woman ] All right . Bring it in this way . - Got it . - No pulse . No respiration . We 've got a full code here , people . Ten c.c. ' s of epinephrine now . Prepare to defibrillate . Starting at 100 . All clear . - [ Woman ] Clear . - [ Man ] Clear . Hi . You okay ? Yeah . I guess . Come on . Is she ... asleep ? [ Whispers ] Faith . Faith . Oh . Hi . Did you see her ? Who ? My mommy . She was right here . There 's no one here . I must have been dreaming . But it was so real . We were laughing and talking about what we were gonna do . And ... I didn 't feel ... you know , sick anymore . How do you feel ? Better since you got here . Here . It was my mom 's . It 's mine now . She said ... that I should hold it ... and think about her whenever ... I feel frightened or sad . You know , it 's like ... I feel her with me again . [ Sobs ] And ... before you know it ... I 'm not frightened or lonely anymore . It always makes me feel better . Thank you . And thank you for being my friend . I 'll always be your friend . I 'll always be there for you and watching over you . Just like my mommy . Mommy . Mommy . [ Very Faint ] Mommy . She 's gone . [ Young Miss Parker ] No . No , Faith . Oh , please , no , Faith . - Please , Faith . Don 't leave , Faith . No . Please . - [ Alarm Ringing ] - They 'll be here soon . Come on . - M-Must ... g-go . No . Faith . [ Alarm Continues ] [ Steady Beep ] I told you I 'd always be watching you . You 've got to fight . You can 't give up . It 's not your time yet . All clear . You mommy loves you very much . And she wants you to fight too . Up to 200 . One more time . [ Steady Beep ] [ Faith ] Your mommy loves you very much . [ Echoes ] [ Young Miss Parker ] Mama , show me how to braid my hair . All right . - [ Beeps ] - We got her . This one 's a fighter . Jarod , you can 't give up . I don 't understand . Just hang on . They 'll be coming for you soon . Don 't give up . [ Giggling ] Not yet . You can 't ... have me ... yet . Just hang on . It 'll be daylight s-soon . Hang on . - Any news on Miss Parker ? - Nothing . But her father should be there by now . He was flying back in as soon as he heard what happened . - And I found something . - What ? Buried deep in the Centre Archive . - Faith . - Faith ? Who is she ? Young girl who was here a long time ago . But the record 's incomplete . Somebody went to a lot of trouble to hide the truth . - Any luck with Jarod ? - Oh , yeah . [ Clears Throat ] Using a map of Yellowstone , flight charts and satellite weather imaging ... from the last time you spoke with Jarod ... I figure he went down somewhere right in here . [ Sydney ] That would take days to search . Well , maybe not . I contacted the Montana Air Patrol ... and they received a distress call from someone in this area ... but lost it before they could establish an exact location . - Jarod ? - Well , it has to be . - Using an emergency radio . - Mm-hmm . I correlated my data along with the location of the air patrol 's receiving station . See , I figure he 's got to be right here along this three-mile bank of river . Contact the Montana Air Patrol immediately . Okay . [ Sydney ] I just hope we 're not too late . [ Machine Beeping ] Her vitals are stable . - All we can do now is wait . - Th-Thank you , Nurse . Faith , where are you ? Where are you ? Faith , where are you ? [ Crying ] Are you gonna be all right ? I think so . Where did she go ? I don 't know . At least she didn 't die alone . I wonder if we 'll ever see her again . Have faith . [ Sobs ] She said she 'd always be watching over us . I miss her ... and I don 't even know who she was . [ Sobbing ] [ Machine Beeping ] [ Exhales Deeply ] - Daddy . - I 'm so glad you 're back . - Daddy . - Yes , angel . Who 's Faith ? Faith ... was your sister . [ Young Mr. Parker ] What an awful way to die . [ Young Raines ] Mr. Parker , the Cleaners will be here soon to dispose of the body . [ Young Mr. Parker ] God 's sake , Raines . Don 't you have any compassion ? Find the priest that did Catherine 's funeral . Father Moore . I want him to make the arrangements . [ Young Raines ] Father Moore ? I never trusted him . We don 't know what all Catherine may have told him over the years . [ Mr. Parker ] I don 't think you understand me . Catherine 's wishes will be carried out . The body is to go to Father Moore . End of discussion ! [ Young Mr. Parker ] Oh , Lord . Nobody should ever die alone . [ Echoes ] - [ Wolf Growls ] - [ Gasps , Panting ] [ Growls ] [ Growls ] You can 't have me yet . [ Grunts ] [ Helicopter Whirring ] [ Jarod Grunts , Pants ] Over here ! - He 's alive . - I 'll be dammed . [ Miss Parker ] Daddy , why didn 't you tell me about Faith ? I didn 't tell you about Faith first because , uh , I knew she was dying . After your mother ... I couldn 't tell you . We 'd both had enough . She was my sister ? Her parents were killed . She became a ward of the state . Then she was diagnosed with leukemia . The doctor said there was , uh , nothing could be done . So the state , uh , put her in a convalescent home ... to die . How did she end up at the Centre ? Well , your , uh - your mother 's priest , Father Moore , told her about the girl . They went to see her . Your mother said that might have been you in the nursing home . She had to do something ; otherwise , she couldn 't live with herself . So the two of you adopted her . Ah . Well , with Father Moore 's help ... we brought her to the Centre ... where Catherine could be with her . We doctored her with an experimental drug the Centre was developing . Future treatment proved successful because of what we had learned from Faith . She died shortly after Catherine . [ Sobs ] Miss Parker . There 's some people who would like to see you . Miss Parker . Hi . - Mr. Parker . - [ Sydney ] The nurse called to let us know ... that you 'd regained consciousness . And I thought you 'd want this . [ Sobs , Giggles ] Thank you both . Broots . [ Clears Throat ] Guess we 'll see you later . [ Cell Phone Rings ] - [ Beeps ] - Yes . - Thank you . - [ Beeps ] What ? Jarod ? They found him . Alive . [ Man ] Jarod . It 's nice to finally meet you in the flesh . I 'm Father Moore . But how did you find me ? Well , I was concerned when you didn 't arrive at Butte . You seemed so anxious to meet the last time we spoke . Our mutual friend at the Centre told me what happened and where I could find you . - The Centre ? - No . No , no . Relax . The Centre has no idea where you are or where we 're going . Thank you - for helping me . Catherine Parker would have wanted it that way . [ Miss Parker ] I 'd forgotten how beautiful it is . - How did you get it ? - An old friend of your mother 's . - Father Moore . - He found the rosary clutched in Faith 's hand . He knew how much it meant to your mother ... so he wanted me to give it to you . Thank you , Jarod . Do you ever think about her ? I think about her all the time . - It 's ironic too . - What is ? All those years ago - you and I - we went searching for death ... and we found someone who saved our lives . I 'm sure she was in that room with me . And I 'm sure she was with me up on that mountain . She said she 'd always be watching over us . She was . - Are we crazy ? - I don 't know exactly what happened . - But I do know that I 'm sure of one thing . - What ? Love ... transcends death . That the people we love touch our lives ... even after they 're gone . [ Giggling ]

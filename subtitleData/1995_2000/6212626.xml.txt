 Houston , this is Excursion . We see a good orbit-insertion burn . Over . Excursion , this is Houston . We copy and concur . Good 0-1 burn . Houston , can you confirm good KU . Antenna coverage for lander deploy ? Inco , this is the flight director . How does our KU look for lander docking system release ? Flight , this is inco . We should have good KU coverage all the way through L.D.S. release . In fact , we 're covered all the way through landing and air lock egress . Houston , stack going to minus z-l-v . Flight , prop . Uh , RCS margins good . Copy . Control systems propellant quantities good . Flight , eecom . Lander umbilicals dead-faced . Copy . Lander on internal power . De-orbit burn tig in five , four , three , two , one . T-orbit burn in progress . Flight , rendezvous . Excursion sep maneuver is nominal . Lander , this is Houston . We show nominal de-orbit . Looks pretty good from this end . The eagle has landed ... Again . Way to go ! Yes ! Houston , we have touchdown at MET ... 182 days , 11 hours , 53 minutes , 37 seconds . Excursion , Houston . You are go to reconfigure nominal dap , b-1 . - Copy , Houston . Selecting item 30 . - I 'm there . Set P.E.T. Countdown . It 's one hour till party time , baby . Commanding camera boom deployment . Flight , E.V.A. air lock depressurization complete . Hatch coming open . Comm check on IFM uplink . Do you read ? We 're with you , Patrick . Houston , Excursion . Deploying rover two . We confirm rover two 's telemetry is go for deploy . Excursion , this is Houston . Are you receiving rover one 's carrier signal through the lander 's uplink ? That 's affirm , Houston . We expect excellent video from rover one . Not for one nation , not for one people , not for one creed , but for all humankind . Patrick Ross ... son of a senator , football star at Yale , and now the first man on Mars . A perfect hero for these imperfect times . Patrick , this is Excursion . I need you to check rover two 's next drilling site for me . And , Patrick , take a look at your primary 0-2 ... And power levels on your DCM suit parameters all look good . Structure around is loamy . Loose topsoil is rock . Drill bit shows signs of wear and tear . It 'll last . One more area . Sector 112 . Okay ? It might have been a canal bed . Eight years of training , and I 'm a martian ditchdigger . You have one hour , 30 minutes surface time left . And counting . Final sample loaded . Prepping for air lock ingress . In a world beset by violence , hunger and strife , there are occasions when mankind surpasses the petty struggles of daily existence . The Excursion voyage to Mars is one of those occasions . Today America is proud . I told them not to go ! I told them ... Not to go ! Three , two , one ... Let 's get you outta here . Oh , my god . It was incredible . A tremendous achievement that once again proves ... That if we can rise above partisan politics ... America can climb to the heavens . Thank you , Mr. President . The credit goes to my crew . Fly home safe , son . Our prayers are with you , and god bless you . Thank you , Mr. President . Flight nav , we 'd like the crew to take a star tracker pass ... And perform an IMU alignment ... Before we update the state vector . Capcom , let the crew know navigation wants a fix on a star position ... And alignment of the interior moment unit ... Before putting a new state vector on board . Houston , this is Excursion . We have your new state vector on board . Excursion , Houston . We copy you . Have received the updated vector . Coming up on tig for transfer orbit burn . Copy , Houston . Excursion , you are good to go . Thanks , Houston . Thirty seconds to transfer orbit tig . We 're homeward bound , baby . Whoo ! Yes , sirs ! Excursion , Houston . Transfer orbit burn in 20 , 19 , 18 , 17 , 16 , 15 , 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Excursion , this is Houston calling . Do you read us ? Over . Excursion , this is Houston . Do you copy ? For the past three minutes ... Every attempt to communicate with the Excursion has failed . I told ' em not to go to Mars ! I told ' em not to go ! G.c. , flight . Check all relay stations on the network . Have the backup tdrs on standby . Flight to all operators . Pull up your data passes from the burn . Get with your back rooms . Verify we saw no anomalies . For god 's sake , somebody tell me she didn 't blow . Houston , this is Excursion . We had a malfunction in the KU band antenna , lost telemetry and comm . I 've performed a bit of IFM Seems to be okay now . Excursion crew is okay . Headed for rendezvous with big blue . It 's gonna be good to get home . Over and out . The extraterrestrial vulnerability experiment ... has one central goal : To discover a means to defend ourselves against the alien species , should they Ever return to Earth . Now , as you know , gentlemen , Eve was recreated ... From a frozen lab embryo . She 's a genetic duplicate of the original sil . Now , we have deliberately shielded Eve ... From any direct contact with the male gender , which is why , gentlemen , you 're inside there . So . Proceed . Aaah ! Help ! Help ! Laura ! Please ! Okay , that 's enough . Bring her up . Bingo , Dr. Baker ! It worked ! Take a look at those beautiful welts . Just beautiful . Beautiful . What happened , Dr. Baker ? Our problem , in a nutshell : A toxic agent works once , but then it becomes useless ... Once the alien 's biology adapts . You 've gone out of your way to give this ... this lab animal ... A living situation that 's fit for a queen . I suggest you spend more time finding a way to ... to 86 the damn thing . Colonel , you 're welcome to replace me anytime you like . I 'm sorry , gentlemen . Tell Dr. Baker ... We must continue testing . Aye , aye , sir . Cartoon ) Why do you do this to me ? I 'm sorry , Eve . I 've explained to you why we 've gotta do this , what happened with the first sil . And why you have to be prepared . Survival of the fittest . I know . I watch this TV , and I see all the places I 'm never gonna go ... And see all the people I 'm never gonna meet . Is that all I am to you ? A laboratory animal ? I want you to understand that the reason I took this job ... Was to make sure that these experiments were done with regard for you . Just don 't forget that I 'm human too . Main gear touchdown . Shuttle ground support vehicles ... With flight surgeon and medical team in the crew recovery vehicle are en route . Thanks , Houston . It 's good to be home . Thanks . You 're welcome . On preliminary examination , all three of you are in remarkable health , though , of course , I 'll continue more specific blood testing . We do have a few people here who would like a further examination . Whoo ! Boy , there 's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me . - Hi ! - You are under quarantine , Mr. Gamble . No sexual activity for at least ten days . That means all of you . Oh , you 've gotta be kidding . No , I 'm not kidding . Back when President Kennedy began the space program , I was just a very young assistant up on the hill . It didn 't take me long to realize that he was a visionary ... And that I shared that vision . Later on , when I became a senator , I was determined to push our program even further into space . And so today , Jack Kennedy 's vision ... Is maintained by the commitment of American business . But I like to think that his spirit is embodied ... In young men like Patrick Ross . When Patrick was four or five years old ... What happened to Patrick ? I don 't know , but he 's missing some major butt-kissing ... From his own father . He hasn 't been feeling very well tonight . Tell you the truth , I haven 't been feeling so great either . Yeah , I think what we all need is a little tender loving care . So it 's with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce one of our finest young leaders ... the captain of the Mars mission ... And my son , Patrick Ross . Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick I 've gotta go . Lincoln suite , upstairs . Hurry . Captain Ross , everyone 's waiting . This way , sir . Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Nice of you to show up , son . Thank you all for coming out this evening . Thank you , father , for what I 'm sure were overly kind words . Um , I 've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew ... To , uh , represent the mission to Mars , and , uh , an image that comes to my mind ... Is looking through the portal ... At the blue-white globe ... beautiful , so fragile , so small . And I thought to myself ... How easy it would be to destroy all that god has created . I think , as we look to the future , our greatest mission might be right here at home . It 's open . Come on in . My sister decided to join us . We share everything ... Together . Parker 's going for two , and he 's in there , standing ! Pulse rate is 20 percent below human norm . What do you expect , Brea ? She 's watching baseball . Aah ! God ! Ohh ! God ! Cheering Continues ) You are a hero . Oh , god . It 's my turn . Yes . It is . Announcer ) What a beautiful field ! Unnnh ! Ohh ! - Here it comes ! - Parker 's going for three ! Jeez ! Did someone hit a home run ? Aaah ! Aah ! Aaaah ! My god , help me ! Oh , my god ! Ohh ! No ! Get off me ! Marcy ! Get him off me ! Oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! Aaah ! What the hell is going on ? My god ! Last night , after the fund-raiser , something happened . I try to think about it , I draw a total blank . They always make those drinks ... At those fund-raisers strong . That 's the way they get the wallets to open up . Billy , you tell that old son of a bitch I won 't take " no " for an answer . There 's something wrong with me , dad , since I got back . Do you think a trip to Mars was rough ? You just wait till you try a senate campaign . Dad , listen to me . I 'm having ... I 'm having some kind of breakdown . Stop thinking about the master plan and help me , all right ? - I 'm scared . - Goddamn it ! Quit acting like a spoiled child . You 're a Ross . Behave like one . I 'm gonna give you a piece of advice , boy . Keep your dick in your pants ... And your eyes on the prize . Oh , I know what you been doin ' , and frankly , I don 't give a damn . Dad ... but I have seen too many young men with promising careers ... Piss it all away on a piece of ass . People love you , Patrick . Hell , boy , they idolize you . You 're gonna be President of the United States someday . Now , let 's take a walk through the gallery . Some of my illustrious colleagues are just dyin ' to get your autograph . Yes , sir . Y-yes , it 's very important that I speak with Herman Cromwell . No , h-h-he 's a patient there . Well , uh , c-can I get a message to him ... That Dr. Orinsky called from the lab at Oldham Space Center up in Maryland . Yes , I-it 's very , very important I speak to him . I 'm an old colleague of his . I can 't believe this . Oh , my god . No ! Company , halt ! Left , left ... The substance found in Dr. Orinsky 's wounds ... Is combinant alien-human DNA . This DNA is structurally similar to Eve 's ... But it 's not a perfect match . Obviously Eve has not left the compound , which means , gentlemen , that there 's another one out there . None of our intelligence suggests ... That a foreign power was involved . How do we start looking for this thing ? Well , I would suggest normal investigative procedure ... To cultivate a list of possible suspects , and then test their blood . Thank you , Dr. Baker . We may ask you to help us track it down . Always a pleasure , gentlemen . Get Press Lennox . Ladies and gentlemen , the embassy is secure . The hostages are free . Press Lennox . Diplomatic security provides embassy guards ... And protects against ... Kidnapping and assassination ... And also , of course , special services like the , uh , demonstration we witnessed here today . Excuse me , Mr. Lennox . Somebody needs to see you right away . My assistant will answer any questions you might have . Thank you all very much . Ladies and gentlemen , are there any questions I can answer ? Are you equipped with night vision attack capabilities ? That was really , really great . Well ? The answer is no . Press , we got another fucking alien on the loose . Get somebody else . Come on , buddy . Your country calls . Don 't start waving ' the flag . I 'm in the private sector now . I 've got ... I 've got a business to run . Look at me , Press . You know how I got this goddamn eye . It 's a sacrifice I 'd make again in a heartbeat . But then maybe you haven 't learned the meaning of sacrifice . Listen , pal . The last time I fought with that alien she-bitch , I almost got myself killed . If the government was stupid enough to make another one , I think they can clean up the mess by themselves . We didn 't make this one . Count me out of the search party , okay ? Where is my fucking key ? A million dollars , tax-free . Sure you won 't reconsider ? Welcome to biohazard four . Dr. Baker ! Dr. Baker ! Come out here , Dr. Baker ! Oh , my god . Open the doors . Somebody open the door . Get him away from there . Somebody open the door ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? You know that there 's no men allowed in this lab . Get away ! Calm down . Do you have any respect for what we 're trying to do ? Out now , both of you ! We have an emergency . Now ! Okay , okay . We 'll take it outside . Damn well right we 'll take it outside . Don 't blow a gasket . - Don 't patronize me either . - We 're not patronizing . We 're coming along . Close the doors . Laura , correct me if I 'm wrong . Are you involved in this crazy bullshit ? Dr. Baker runs this facility . She cloned the sil embryo . Oh . Okay , well , what should I call her ? Sil lite ? Her name is Eve . Eve . How very biblical . We 've dampened her mating instinct . We have strictly avoided the presence of testosterone in this lab , at least until now . Thank you for your help in that area . What if she gets out of there ? She 's electronically tethered to a control box . One step off the premises , and a toxic capsule explodes in her brain . You know , it 's really great to see you again ... And I was hoping we 'd meet under better circumstances , but , uh , I remember Laura Baker having a little bit more soul . Just who the hell do you think you are ? You 're coming into my lab , questioning my motives . Are you two finished ? We have a national fucking emergency on our hands . Now , you two will work together . That 's a direct order from the Pentagon . You killed one of these fucking alien things before . Do it again . You heard the man . Now the fun begins . Listen , I went over Orinsky 's phone records . This is the last place he called . I cross-checked all the patients , and I came up with one name , Herman Cromwell . Turns out he taught Orinsky at Stanford . And what exactly is Cromwell doing here ? Well , that 's the interesting part . It 's classified , top-secret information . I was doing research on a Mars meteorite . The one found in the Antarctic in ' 96 ? Fossils in the meteorite convinced us there might have been life on Mars , but these fossils weren 't anything organic to the planet . Oh , no , no , no , no . What was the basis for that determination ? Carbon-based elements in the fossils ... Exist only in the magellanic galaxy . That 's 100 million light years away . Well , how did they get to Mars ? By my reckoning , Mars was visited by an alien species ... Approximately one billion years ago . The species was like a plague , a cancer . It turned a thriving planet ... With rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life ... Into a useless hunk of rock . When I heard they were gonna send a mission to Mars , I strongly urged the government to reconsider . On what grounds ? On grounds that alien DNA might remain on the planet , that any human attempt to violate the planet ... Would result in biological contamination . So , let me guess . They told you to shove it up your ass . They got me fired from Stanford . It seems the military had strategic reasons ... For wanting to go to Mars . Outpost of the future . Some crap like that . Anyway , they harassed the shit out of me . I got into a fistfight with a Pentagon general ... And broke his goddamn jaw . That 's why they stuck you in here , right ? Why do you think that Dr. Orinsky called you the night that he died ? To tell me I was right . Whatever species destroyed Mars ... Those poor astronauts brought down to Earth . May god have pity on our souls . I 'll tell you one thing . For General Lee to be eatin ' up the road this early in the morning , something 's sure got Bo and Luke all het up . I figure it 's got somethin ' to do with women . Or hunting ' . Or maybe wheels . The temperature on Mars ... Is approximately 225 degrees below zero . If they brought the samples on board , the temperature thaw ... Could have brought the DNA back to life . That DNA could have infected the astronauts . This isn 't the fucking x-files , goddamn it . You are following a lead based on the interrogation ... Of a certified nutcase . We 've got one dead NSEG doctor . We have a guy who warned the government not to go to Mars . They slapped him in a loony bin . And a seven-minute time gap during the space flight . We need to do blood analysis on Sampas , Gamble and Ross . Now , I know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days ... On all interplanetary missions , and the Mars quarantine ends tonight . They could fuck the human race into extinction . You wanna be responsible for that if we don 't start testing everybody right away ? Test Patrick first . Uh-huh . Yeah . I 've been waiting to get you alone . All the interviews , all the screaming girls . All the hoopla . Gone . Push it out of your mind . Patrick Ross , tonight ... You 're mine . I love you . What 's the matter ? I don 't know . We should hold off . Oh , no . No , you don 't . Not tonight . Come on , missy . I don 't feel so good . Shh . Relax . Let me do the work . There 's nobody here . Where the fuck did he go ? Let 's go find the others . I missed you up there . I missed you so much . It 's so beautiful . Not as beautiful as you are . Charmer . Take it easy , Press . You 're gonna get us killed . Trust me , Laura . I got a bad feeling in my stomach . God , I missed making love with you . Oh ! Oh ... Oh , my stomach ! Oh , my god ! Call someone . Call for help ! Up here . Come on ! No ! No , no , please ! No ! Oh , god . I 'm gonna get a full crew . I 'm gonna get ' em over here right away . We gotta get to the others . Oh , this is awful . This is just awful . ¶ ¶ And I Been Thinkin ' Of You ¶ Pow ! I 'll take her the rest of the way . Have a good evening . This is nice . You thought the brother lived on a tugboat . I know what you thought . But I got it all under control now . Oh , you do ? Yeah , you just slide that thing right over there . Let me open this door . There we go . Hey , girl . ¶ ¶ I Knew I Wanted To be your man ¶ ¶ You Know , I Been Thinkin ' about you , girl ¶ ¶ Thinking Of You ¶ ¶ I Know It Was A Long Time Ao But I want to know ¶ Ooh . Ooh . ¶ I Been Thinkin ' Of You ¶ Is that it ? No , honey , that 's not it . Right there . No , that 's not it . Oh , that 's it . What 's wrong ? Dennis Gamble , we 'd like you to come with us . Man , a brother just can 't get no booty . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? This is no way to treat a national hero . This is embarrassing . What is this all about ? Look , somebody speak to me . Hey , hey , hey . I 'm a personal friend of Senator Judson Ross . Personal friend . I 'm gonna eat your badge for breakfast . Get your hand off my head , man . I demand an explanation . We 'll have the test results in a few minutes . Why am I being tested ? NSEG said I was fine . Sit tight , son . We 'll explain everything later . Well , it 's kind of tough to sit tight , sir . I haven 't been laid in 11 months . That 's unusual for me . Take it easy , Burgess . Everybody deserves an explanation . You 're damn right . A-and what 's with all these guards ? What the hell is going on around here ? It 's purely a precautionary measure . We need a couple of minutes for this computer to analyze your blood , so just relax . Couple of questions . What can you tell us about the seven minutes when the Excursion lost contact with Earth ? I can 't remember . I don 't know if I blacked out or what , but I can 't remember . When did you last speak to Anne Sampas ? At that fund-raiser . Did she act peculiar ? No , she seemed fine to me . What 's this all about ? Something happen to her ? You tell me . What happened to Anne Sampas ? Tell me ! What happened to Anne Sampas ? Anne Sampas is dead . I 'm sorry , Dennis . Yeah . Laura . Well , the combinant DNA in Anne 's body doesn 't match what I found in Orinsky 's , so , uh , it 's either Gamble or Ross . Be careful , Press . What was the cause of death ? We don 't know . Come on , man . How the hell did she die ? Sequence almost complete . Why are you testing my blood ? Ten seconds till relay . You think I killed Annie ? Data retrieval on-line . Is that what you think ? I didn 't kill her . Five seconds . Three seconds . I didn 't kill her , I swear ! Computer says normal . There is no sign of infection . Go home , get some rest . I want answers . In due time . We 'll be in touch . Yo , Gamble . You know where Patrick Ross is ? Nope . Well , if you see him , you 'll let me know , yeah ? Sure . Well , let 's see ... What the cranial cavity has to say . Now I 'll just reach behind her ear , and we should ... god . Patrick , no ! Want a date , Mister ? ¶ I was scared , man . This is crazy . His whole head just grew right back like some sort of damn freak show . The alien species can regenerate living tissue . Aliens , little green men . I still can 't believe it . If they knew there were aliens up there , why the hell they send us ? NSEG got warned , but they chose to ignore it . We think there was some hostile DNA in the soil samples you collected . Wait a minute . Something happened up there . I can 't remember exactly . I just know it was terrible . I 'm sure that it was terrible . The question is : How do we proceed now ? I got guys out there all over the place looking for this kid . Any place he might be . We 're gonna find him sooner or later . If he 's reproducing , we 've got potential offspring . I think it 's safe to assume that he 's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time . Then in less than two weeks , these offspring reach adolescence . - Then they enter the chrysalis stage . - Chrysalis stage ? A cocoon which turns them into adults . ¶ Hey , baby . Turn that car around . Hey , don 't leave me . Come on . Hi , honey . Baby , come back . A serial killer may be loose in the Washington / Maryland area . Authorities have asked the public to be extremely cautious ... When approached by strangers . Please , beware . How much for number three ? - Twenty an hour . - Thank you , Linda . Now for the financial news . Twenty , forty , sixty . Thank you much . Enjoy yourself . ¶ Come in . ¶ Woman , I Don 't Want A soul ¶ See what I mean , Laura ? Every so often , her rates go berserk . Fifty agents we got out there looking for this guy . We got nothing . Man , how can you just touch that ? Occupational hazard . So you didn 't see nothin ' , you didn 't hear nothin ' , you don 't know nothin ' . They come and they go . You know what I mean ? They come ... And they go . Oh , that 's hysterical . Sit your ass down . They come , they go . You get it ? Oh , yeah , I get it . Here you go . Thanks . Hey ! Hey ! ¶ The Four-forty ¶ ¶ We Gotta Rock It ¶ ¶ The Four-forty ¶ ¶ We Gotta Rock It ¶ We 're wasting time . It 's been two days , and Lennox hasn 't made any headway . Maybe That 's because you gentlemen won 't allow us to go public . Dr. Baker , you said that Eve has telepathic abilities . - Some . - Can we send her after Patrick ? It 'd be foolish to take her out of a controlled atmosphere . There 's the danger of escape . Then we 've got two aliens running around instead of one . If these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable . Can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab ? We 've seen spiking in her biorhythms ... Which indicate a rudimentary connection , but half her alien genes are dormant . Tracking Patrick is out of her league . Dormant means asleep . Is there any way that we can wake them up ? We could use the lab 's cyclotron ... To bombard her with radiation that would awaken her dormant genes , but there is a problem . What 's that ? We make her more alien . We increase her strength , her anger . Her mating drive would go through the roof . It 's worth the risk . We 'll tighten security . She is not a lab animal . She is half-human . Please , Baker , spare us the alien rights agenda . Put her in the cyclotron . - And what if I refuse ? - That 's your prerogative . She 's gonna go in anyway . Gentlemen . Don 't worry , Laura . I know what they want . I 'm sorry . This is not what I intended . It 's gonna be very painful for you . I wanna help . I 'm going to radiate for 45 seconds , then shut it down . Okay . I 'm connected , Laura . I see what he sees . He 's driving down a small street . I see two-story buildings . Uh , a man walking a small dog . - They 're stopping at a stoplight . - O-Okay , okay , here we go . I see street signs . Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick . Gwynn 's falls ... he 's crossed into a parking lot . What ? Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick . Gwynn 's falls ? Where ? That 's in reservoir hill . There 's a big supermarket . And a supermarket . The supermarket near Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick . Hang on to your shorts ! He 's going after a woman ! Let 's go ! Aah ! How the hell 'd you get a driver 's license ? Where is he , Eve ? Aisle one . Fruits and vegetables . He 's in aisle one . Fruits and vegetables . ROB , Can you come to the front ? I need a price check , please . Check okay on seven . Meat department , call on line one . I need someone at the customer service desk . Hey ! Hey ! We 're there ! Now what ? Come on , Press . Let 's move ! My god . It 's you ! - Will you sign my space flakes box ? - Sure . You got a pen ? I do . - What 's your name ? - Uh , Darlene . Darlene . You know a secret , Darlene ? I think space flakes taste like shit . Which row ? Cereal . Come on , Press . Watch it ! Hey , man ! Where 's the goddamn cereal ? It 's nice to meet you . Really nice to meet you . - It 's her ! - Help me ! Which way ? Quick ! Which way ? What 's she saying ? They 're going down some stairs . A basement . Find a basement . It 's dark . He wants to mate with her . Get away ! Get up ! Shut up ! Help ! Get down ! Damn it ! No ! Help ! Help me ! Hmm ? Hmm . He 's trying to rape her . Man , don 't shoot ! Why don 't you get a motel ? Fuckin ' kids . He knows I 'm tapping in . Help ! Leave me alone ! Stop ! Get off me ! - Eve . - Patrick . Let me go ! Go on ! Get out of here ! Get out ! Hey ! Don 't move , spaceman . Put down the gun . Get your hands up . Get ' em up ! What the hell is this , Dennis ? You can 't deny some bugged-out stuff goin ' on around here . - What kind of stuff ? - You told me yourself you were feelin ' weird . You gotta go in for tests , bro . Okay . Sure . I-I-I don 't mind going into the lab . Open the gate . What the hell is going on ? Estrogen level 's peaking . It 's like she 's in heat . Let me out ! Let me out ! Let 's go . - Has she been given any medication ? - Yes , her usual dose . Let me out , Laura ! I 'm gonna double it . Let me out ! Listen to me , Laura . Laura ! Code 459 alert . Patrick Ross in biohazard 4 . Seal the compound ! Get out of there , Sherry ! Patrick ! - Leave her alone ! - Open the door . I know what you 're going through , and I can help you . Let me help you . Open the goddamn door . I can 't do that . I 'm sorry . Open it ! I can 't do that ... Get away from her ! Get away from her now ! The proof is incontrovertible . Your son was infected up in that capsule . I 'm sorry , Senator . Jesus god . Rest assured we 'll deal with this quietly . Medical treatment , the best doctors . The last thing this country needs is a spectacle ... With a national hero being publicly compromised . Oh , cut the crap , Carter . What the hell are we gonna do ? Two imperatives : We have to find Patrick and bring him in immediately . We have to neutralize any possibility ... That this situation could leak to the media . The generals are very concerned . They 're gonna kill him , aren 't they , Carter ? We need to find your son . Now , you listen to me , you arrogant son of a bitch ! If you so much as touch a hair on his head , you will rue the day you were born ! You make it very hard to help you , Senator . Go fuck yourself ! What the hell did you think I was gonna do ? Stand here and let you take my son ? I 'll call the goddamn president if I have to . Listen carefully , old man . This is way beyond the president . Way beyond . Oh ? You want to save Patrick ? Help us bring him in . Damn , man , what is up ? I can 't even get no play from an alien ! Some people carry a disease in their genetic code . It doesn 't mean they have the disease , but the possibility exists ... It might be passed on to their children . - Well , those NSEG doctors told me I had sickle trait . - Right . It 's in your chart . You don 't have sickle-cell anemia , which is why you were able to go to Mars , but you 're a carrier . - Right . - I guess that 's why he didn 't get infected on the ship . Right . The alien DNA cannot cope with human genetic flaws . It has no defense against our diseases , and that might be our answer . Wait . W-what could be the answer ? The alien DNA infected us . It 's about time we infected them . What ? Patrick ? Dad , what are you doing here ? Well , I kind of figured you 'd show up here . You always used to love this place as a child . So 'd your mother . I never could convince her to get rid of it . Yeah , I used to come here when I was courtin ' her . Then , after she died ... What do you want ? Well , first off , I 'd ... I 'd like to apologize . Apologize for what ? Oh , Paddy . Don 't bother . They told me what happened . How you got infected up on Mars . I 'm sorry , Paddy , for not listening when you asked for help . You never listened . I 'm listenin ' now . They 're gonna kill me . Not if I can help it . Now , there 's no way that they can find you here . This property is still listed under your mother 's maiden name . And I sure am not gonna hand you over to those Pentagon bastards . No , sir . I am taking you in to Johns Hopkins ... For treatment with the best . We 'll walk through that door together . Come in with me , son . No . I know you won 't do it for me . Try to think of your mother , Paddy . Do it for her . Dad , help me . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . Okay . Thank you . Eve ? Eve ? We need your help again to find Patrick . I 'm sorry , Laura . I can 't do that . We could just call in the national guard . Sorry , pal . This is strictly a private mission . Yeah , well , I 'm a lover . I 'm not a fighter . You haven 't been one of those in ... 11 months . Oh , man , why you gotta bring that up ? Okay , I was a lover . I sure as hell ain 't no damned bounty hunter . This looks about right . What ? That little old tiny-ass thing ? You ain 't got no bazookas up in here , man ? Bazookas ? Hasn 't anyone ever told you that size doesn 't matter ? Hey . Hey . Whoo ! Hey . You can talk all that noise if you want to .

 You 'll make man ? No . Woman . Woman ? THEME SONG : Weird Science . Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , my creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . My creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! What seems to be the problem , Bink ? I don 't want to say . It 's your body , isn 't it ? Every day you awake to discover your body changing in new and fantastic ways . Not to mention freaky . Puberty , young Bink . You 're on the hormone highway to a grand new adventure . I want to rip . When I signed on for AV duty I figured I 'd get to play with some cool CD-ROMS . What do I get instead ? Army surplus projectors in a 20 year old personal hygiene film called " Say Hello to Body Hair . " Tell me more about this thing called puberty , Nurse Hastings . Technically it 's your body transmogrifying from a smooth , sweet scented boy to a hairy , musky man . I 'm so glad I didn 't have to live through the ' 70s . I mean , check out how poofy that kid 's hair is . I hate Farber . We 're living in the computer age , but we 're going to school in the stone age . Oh , come on , Wyatt . It 's not so bad . Yes it is . All my life I 've been waiting for the future to get here . Hey , me too . I keep wishing it was Friday , like , all the time . No , the future future . Voice activated computes at every desk . Those- - those doors that slide open when you walk up to them . You mean like in supermarkets ? Well , yeah . Yeah , but in school . I want to rocket into class on a jetpack . I want to play zero gravity dodgeball . I want to do all that fun stuff I see on " Star Trek . " I love " Star Trek . " That Captain Picard is some hot bald action . Lis , you think you could help out with a little zappage ? Give Farber a hi-tech makeover ? Make the future happen now ? Piece of cake . I can handle this wish blindfolded . INTERCOM : Remember , a healthy attitude makes for healthy students . Whoa . The future has arrived . You diggin ' it ? I 'm diggin ' it . [ BEEPING ] Hi , guys . Your boring school day just became a sci-fi thrill ride , guaranteed to make you smile . I am very impressed . Yeah , me too . Good zapping , Lis . And I did it all blindfolded . I can 't wait to see the AV room . Me too . Let 's run . OK , then what do you want to do ? Start small . Drink of water ? Hello . Thirsty ? You can choose from a wide selection of delicious , thirst quenching beverages . Please make your selection now . Cool . It sure beats the old brown , rusty gunk , huh ? Brown , rusty gunk has been selected . Thank you . Ew . Oh . I love a girl in a uniform . [ ALARM ] Principal Scampi , sensors are picking up hormonal activity in sector three . Impossible . My students are completely under control . Run a systems check . I did . It confirms cross-gender interest . Sir , I 've got one- - no , two signals . Lock on to it . I 'm trying . Eh . Looked better coming than going . I 've lost the signal , sir . So , it appears that puberty has once again reared its monstrous head in the halls of my school . Go ahead . Try to blend in , my friend . It 's only a matter of time before your hormones get the best of you . Then I 'll have you . INTERCOM : Third period classes are about to begin . Please proceed to the nearest jet tube . I just thought of something . What ? Maybe we 're supposed to go one at a time . I 've got a clog in sector B. Cafeteria must be using the tubes to transport garbage again . Permission to flush ? Flush on my command . Flush . Oh , man . I got tube burn . All right . Cool . VR helmet . And who would like to go next ? Right here . So , what 's the game called ? Learning Shakespeare . [ MUMBLING ] Well , how do you feel ? You 've just had the complete works of William Shakespeare burned directly into your cerebral cortex . Really ? I guess I kind of tuned out . INTERCOM : Remember , Farber High students are patient , helpful , and thoughtful . Is it just me , or is everyone acting kind of crazy ? Indeed . Yon grim looks do testify . Huh ? What ? I think you just said something , you know , Shakespearean . Ha ! You yanketh me . Hark- - I mean- - whoa . I am Frogzar , intergalactic warrior from the planet Punderzoy . Did I get ya ? I got you , didn 't I ? Big funny , Lis . So , what 's up next ? Gym . Or should I say the future of gym ? Prepare to marvel at the wondrous technological advancements the future holds . INTERCOM : Remember , a strong body builds a healthy mind . Is it just me , or did you expect a little more ? Don 't tell Lisa I said this , but this wish is pretty sucky . As waters to the sucking of a gulf . I suppose she means well , but from what I can tell , the future isn 't what it 's cracked up to- - be . Oh . Sorry . Wrong stall . Lisa done good . Let us bask in the glow of bodies unadorned . Unauthorized hormonal activity detected . Is it a strong signal ? It 's redlining . I 've pinpointed their location . Hygiene unit 47 . We 've got them . [ ALARM ] Identify . Stop ! Where 's the exit ? Halt . Move and you 're vapor trails . Alas , we 're to be cast into the rotten mouth of death . If you quote Shakespeare one more time , I 'll kill you myself . Et tu , Wyatt ? I 'm receiving orders . The fugitives are to be taken to the nurse 's office . The nurse 's office ? Why ? To have your skulls drilled for brain chip implantation . No . No ! No ! There must be some kind of mistake . I didn 't want this . I just wanted to see the future . You and your wish most vile . Could I not but change yesterday ? This is the last time I let her zap blindfolded . But to die and go we know not where , to lie in cold obstruction , to rot , moldering most foul . Will you stop that ? We 're not gonna die . We 're just going to wish we were dead . [ SCREAMING ] Principal Scampi ? Ah , my ever elusive quarry . At last we meet . Why are we being punished ? We haven 't done anything wrong . You are what 's wrong , Mr. Donnelly . You 're an anomaly in my school , a chipless stranger in a strange land . Alas , thy words dos vex me . Don 't insult my improbably large intelligence , boy . You know the law requires all teenagers to have control chips implanted in their skulls . To control what ? Puberty . Even as we speak , your hormones are pumping by the proverbial boatload through your twitching teenage bodies . Chunka chunka chunka , 24 hours a day . So what ? Puberty is a natural part of life . Yea , verily . Blame not the horned dog for his most randy desires . It 's because of those randy desires the elders created the hormone control chip , to make a living with our youths bearable . Goodbye , gentlemen . When we meet again , you will be well . Good afternoon , boys . My name is Nurse Adder , and I 'll be performing your waxing , teeth cleaning , control chip implant . Comfortable ? No . Excellent . Let 's floss , suture , bore a hole in your skull . Who 's first ? - Him ! Himeth ! Patient number one has been chosen . Please flare your nostrils for easy bone drill insertion . This may be a little uncomfortable . Painful . Bloody . If you need to rinse and spit , just ask . Yes ! He needs to rinse and spit ! I doeth ? Trust me , you do . Now . Rinse . And spit . Spit ! There , now . That wasn 't so bad . Now , turn your head and cough . Cough . Cough . INTERCOM : Remember , Farber High students control their emotions . Their emotions don 't control them . [ BEEPING ] Aye , captain . Lis , you gotta get us outta here . We got trouble . You 've got troubles ? I 've got overheated lithium crystals that could blow any second . OK , now you say beam me up , Lisa . Thy wit blows as foul as the winds of our troubles . And your Scotty impression sucks . OK , what 's with the attitude ? The wish turned deadly . Again . What 's that supposed to mean ? You think that I don 't put thought into these wishes ? Huh ? You accusing me of not paying attention ? Oh , piece of glitter . [ ALARM ] INTERCOM : Unauthorized student detected . Relax . It 's just a silly security camera . Gulp . Wow . I got waxed . Lis , what do we do ? I can 't risk coming back in with those sentries . I 'll tap into the main computer and find a way to get you out of there . Until then , lay low . I 'm receiving a priority one communication . It 's Superintendent Calamari . Put it on the screen . Scampi . Calamari . Have you crushed the hormonal uprising ? Yes , superintendent . I 've taken care of the troubled youths . You better have , Scampi . If you fail me , I promise you won 't live to see your own tenure . Ah . A threat ? Kill me , and my union will fire off a letter of protest before my lifeless body hits the ground . You won this round , Scampi . But I 'll be back . And I 'll be waiting . It 's about time . I think I found a way to get you out . I 've been checking the school 's schematics . All power funnels through the primary core . Get to it and pull the zirconium crystals . And , uh , be careful . They may be radioactive . They may be radioactive , or they are radioactive ? Uh , right . Alas , light through yonder window breaks . We 're not leaving . Yanketh thou upon my chain ? Don 't you see ? These people are being robbed of the pleasures of youth . The thrill of catching a girl 's eye across a dance floor . The head rush when Miss Bouvier wears that black , lacy thing with the stripe on it . The simple joy of copping a feel in the backseat of a Corolla Scampi has to be stopped . OK , we 're in . Good . Pull the third crystal . It should deactivate the doors . Which one deactivates the control chips ? Control chips ? I thought you wanted out of there . Right after Scampi 's reign of terror ends . This was not the plan , Wyatt . There 's a new plan ! OK , OK . We 'll take care of the control chips . Jet tubes . Meal service . Hey , I 've got an idea . Why don 't you just pull all of them ? [ ALARM ] Status report . We 've lost microwave oven control in home ec . Engage emergency override . Divert power from the teacher 's lounge . But they 're grading papers in there . What will they use for light ? Just do it , dammit . Do it ! Carmichael , I want answers , and I want them now . Sensors indicate an unusual power surge in sector three . Trace it . I have . It originates at the primary core . Put it on screen . Wallace . Donnelly . Security to sector three . Go . I got it . No , let me go . Uh-oh . We lost security in the tube clog . Then I have no choice . Arm the sentry . [ BEEPING ] INTERCOM : Step away from the crystals . Gary ? Wyatt ? What 's going on ? Somebody talk to me . So you 've stooped to vandalism ? I 'm not surprised . I should 've chipped you myself . I 'm coming in . Lisa ? Shh . I made this tin foil suit to fool the sensors into thinking I 'm a vending machine . INTERCOM : Unauthorized snack food dispenser detected . Oh . [ INAUDIBLE ] ! Gary ! Get the laser before it rearms ! I 'm going after them myself . Carmichael , take the com . Huh ? The com . The what ? The com ! Ah-ha ! We finally meet face to face , Donnelly . Looks like you 've lost your advantage , Scampi . There 's nothing to keep me from destroying these last crystals and freeing these teens . Do that and you 'll unleash untold horrors , uncontrolled teens . Think of their rude behavior , raucous laughter . Their lack of attention span . Their emotional highs , their youthful vitality . Their wild , untamed spirit . A spirit never meant to be tamed . I 'm a principal , dammit , not a philosopher . These students are here to learn , and learn is what they 'll do , no matter the cost . The cost is too high . The cost will be your lives . Attack ! Lisa ! Thank god . Are you OK ? I hate the smell of burnt hair . INTERCOM : Intruder identified . Fear not , sweet Lisa . I have the cannon . Aw , crap . INTERCOM : Problem students identified . Gary , the crystals ! No ! You fools ! What have you done ? I know exactly what I 've done . I 've set them free . Free to think again . Free to be controlled by their emotions . Emotions spawn great poets , scientists , doctors . He 's right . I want to be a doctor . See , Scampi ? They 're human again , and being human is good . Show him ! Show him what unbridled youth is capable of ! Yeah ! I want to save the environment . Yes ! I want to help the poor . Yeah ! I want to be a teacher ! Yeah ! I want to be a fireman ! I wanna be president ! All right ! I hate my parents . I hate homework . I hate everything . Let 's form a gang . Kids . Your selection , butt cheese , is unavailable . Please select again . OK , OK . I 've got a really good one . Skunk juice . Thank you . You know , Mr. Donnelly , perhaps I was wrong to fear puberty . These kids have brought a new life and vitality to this old school . Well , sir , maybe you have as much to learn from them as they do from you . Maybe , son . Maybe . I think things are going to work out just fine . [ ALARM ] Principal 's log , final entry . Scampi has not returned . I fear the worst . I have no choice but to initiate his final order and execute the self destruct sequence . NARRATOR : And now , a scene from next week 's Weird Science . THEME SONG : Weird Science . Fantasy and microchips shooting from the hip . Something different will make it weird science . Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces . Bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

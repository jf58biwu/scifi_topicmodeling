 " Here men from the planet Earth first setfoot upon the moon . " " July 1969 . " " We came in peace for all mankind . " If this isn 't an insanely beautiful woman , I 'm hanging up . Sir , I think you should listen to this . - Goddamn it ! - Sir ? Come on , baby . Come on ! This better not be another damn Russian spy job ! Air traffic say the skies are clear . It 's the real thing . A radio signal from another world . Let 's not jump the gun here . Get online with Space Command . They 're gonna want to know ... What 's with the golf balls ? You 're gonna kill me ! Wait , this can 't be right . The calculated distance from source is only 375,000km . It 's coming from the moon . - Who else knows about this ? - SETI in New Mexico identified a signal . But , they 're even more confused than we are , sir . - Major ! - Yes , sir . Radar reception has been impaired , but we were able to get these . We estimate that it has a diameter of over 550km and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon . What the hell is it ? A meteor ? - No , sir . - No , definitely not . - How do you know ? - Well , sir , it 's slowing down . - It 's what ? - It 's slowing down , sir . Get me the Secretary of Defense . Wake up him ! - Hello . - Hi . - It 's me . - Hi . - What time is it there ? - It 's 2.45 in the morning . - I know I didn 't wake you . - As a matter of fact , you did . Liar . I have a confession to make . I 'm sleeping next to a beautiful , young brunette . You didn 't lether stay up watching TV ? - Did you ? - Of course not . You 're coming home - Right after the luncheon ? - Yes , yes . - Mommy ? - Here 's your mother . - Hi , honey ! - I miss you . President Whitmore 's approval ratings have slipped below 40 % ... He 's good . Are the salad days over for President Whitmore ? Leadership as a gulf War pilot is different from leadership in politics ... Daddy let me watch Letterman . Traitor . They elected a warrior and got a wimp . - Morning , George . - Morning , Mr. President . That game couldn 't have been pretty . Thank you , sir . Connie , you 're up awfully early this morning . They 're not attacking your policies , they 're attacking your age . " Whitmore seems less like the President and more like the orphaned child Oliver asking : 'Please , sir , I 'd like some more . " ' - That 's clever . - I 'm not laughing . Age was not an issue when you stuck to your guns . You were seen as young , idealistic ... Now the message has gotten lost . It 's too much politics , too much compromise . Isn 't it amazing how quickly everyone can turn against you ? It 's a fine line between standing behind a principle and hiding behind one . You can tolerate a little compromise if you 're managing to get something accomplished . Well , the Orange County Dispatch has voted you one of the ten sexiest men ofthe year . That 's accomplishing something ! Mr. President , it 's the Secretary of Defense . Yes . Could you say that again ? So why are you waiting ? My Social Security will expire , you 'll still be sitting there . - I 'm thinking . - Yeah , well , think already ! Do you know how long it takes for those cups to decompose ? If you don 't move soon , I 'll start to decompose . Listen , David , I 've been meaning to talk with you . - It 's nice that you see me so much now ... - Don 't start , Dad . It 's been ... what ? Four years ? You 're still wearing a wedding band ? - Three years . - You 're divorced , move on . - This is not healthy . - No , the smoking is not healthy . Checkmate . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . - Wait . This is not checkmate . - See you tomorrow , Pop . Hold on ! This is not checkmate . Oh ... Checkmate ! We 've got everybody we have working on the problem . I love X-Files too . I hope you get to see it . David ! What 's the point in having a beeper if you don 't turn it on ? I was ignoring you . What 's the big emergency ? It started this morning . Every station 's making like it 's the 1950s . We got static , snow , all kinds of distortions . Nobody knows ... There 's a reason we have bins labelled " Recycle " . What the hell is going on ? My God in heaven ! So sue me . David ! We got a problem ! Did you switch transponder channels ? Please ! You think I 'd be this panicked if it was so simple ? OK , let 's point the dish at another satellite . We tried that . It didn 't work . It 's almost as though they weren 't there . All right . What have we got here ? This is impossible . - The signal 's all screwed up . - Stop it ! Just leave it alone . You 'll break it ! It 's so fuzzy . Oh , no . Morning , Lucas . You see these ? I got a whole goddamn crop full of these . If your father 's not in the air in 20 minutes , I 'm getting someone else . - Russell ! - Hey , Miguel ! Russell ! What are you doing ? Just what in the hell do you think you 're doing ? It 's the wrong field , you idiot ! Lucas 's farm 's on the other side of town ! Are you sure ? CNS is running a story that we 're covering up a nuclear-testing experiment . They can run with it if they want to embarrass themselves . NASA wants to know our position . Our official position is we have no official position . - What is going on here ? - Guys , would I keep you out of the loop ? - Absolutely . - What ? I can 't hear you . At the moment our satellites are somewhat unreliable . Isn 't it possible that this thing may just pass us by ? What if it doesn 't ? Why don 't we target some ICBMs to blow it up ? And risk turning one dangerous falling object into many ? We don 't yet know enough to make any kind of intelligent judgments . Luckily the press is making up their own story for now . But that 's not gonna keep . - We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3 . - Absolutely . General , tell NORAD we 're on DEFCON 3 . - That 's not what the President said . - Isn 't that a bit premature ? Over 50 % of the armed forces are on weekend leave . Plus the commanders and troops that are in town for the Fourth of July parade . The object has settled into a stationary orbit . - Well , that 's good news . - Not really , sir . Part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen pieces . Smaller than the whole , yet over 15 miles in width themselves . Where are they heading ? They should be entering our atmosphere within the next 25 minutes . Take us to DEFCON 3 . - Please say we 're gettin ' somewhere . - There 's good and bad news . - What 's the bad news ? - There 's a penalty for disturbing my lunch . And the good news is you won 't charge me . No . The good news is that the problem is not our equipment , but a weird signal embedded in the satellite feed . That 's the good news ? Yes . It has a sequential pattern . Once I find the exact binary sequence , I can calculate the phase reversal and apply it . We should be able to block it out . And then we 'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture ! Yes ! Yes ! David ! That 's why I love you ! That 's not necessary . Too kind . - This had better be good . - Admiral on deck ! Sir , we 're looking at a total radar blackout over a 13km area . - Let 's do a diagnostic check . - Excuse me , sir . The radar may be malfunctioning , but the infrared is totally off the map . Jeez ! Get me Atlantic Command on line . Hang on , sir . Sir , we have visual range with incoming over Iraqi air space . - Second sighting ? - Yes , sir . Just came in from the Persian Gulf . Correction , sir . We have two confirmed visual contacts . Mr. President , they 're tracking another one off the California coastline ! All right , put it on . General , you might wanna watch this . Ladies and gentlemen , we are interrupting our regular broadcast to bring you extraordinary events taking place in Russia . This unexplained disturbance and the resulting hysteria are incredible . How would you describe what you are seeing ? It is clearing the mountains , moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor . Widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets . It is confirmed . The unexplained phenomenon is headed for Moscow . We have an AWAC off the West Coast . ETA with contact point , three minutes . Don 't understand it , sir . Side radar doesn 't see a thing . I know ! I 'm blind , sir . Nothing is registering . Negative . We have zero visibility . Visibility is at zero . Command , this is Eagle Eye 370 . Captain , the President is listening . Repeat what you just told me . We still have zero visibility . Instrumentation is malfunctioning . We can 't get any kind of reading on what 's in front of us . Wait a minute . It maybe clearing . Pull out ! - Line 's gone , sir . - Two more spotted over the Atlantic . One 's moving toward New York , the other here . - How long do we have ? - Less than 10 minutes . Mr. President , I recommend we move you to a secure location . - Connie , can we expect the same panic ? - More than likely . - We can discuss this on the way . - I 'm not leaving . We have to maintain a working government . Take the Vice President , the whole cabinet , and the Joint Chiefs to a secured location . I 'm staying . I don 't want to add to a public hysteria that 's gonna cost lives . Connie , we 'll initiate the emergency broadcast system . We 'll advise people not to panic . The best idea right now is to stay in their homes . Yes , sir . Roy ? Dean ? Have the cabinet members rendez vous here . We 'll take them to NORAD . Mr. President , with your permission , I 'd like to remain at your side . I had a feeling you would . What happens if they do become hostile ? Then God help us . There it is . The strange atmospheric phenomenon . It is apparently what is causing all the distortions ... David , are you watching this ? There is no evidence that these phenomena are endangering anyone . Thus far , reports of oppression ... Marty , I got a lock on that signal pattern so we can filter it out . But if my calculations are right , it 'll be gone in seven hours . It 's reducing itself every time it recycles so eventually it 'll disappear . - Are you listening ? - Can you believe this ? Haven 't you been watching ? David ! Good afternoon . So far the phenomenon has not caused any damage . We have to ask you to stay calm , and it 's important for everyone not to panic . We have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear ... - It 's just unreal . - Miguel , come here ! One is headed towards Los Angeles . The other two are headed towards New York and Washington , DC . Marty . Jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter . - We 're heading down there now . - Everybody ! Head down to the basement . Take it slow , don 't run . Walk down to the basement ! There 's no shame in hiding . I 'd better call my mother . Well , look who we have here . Russ , I heard you had a little trouble this morning . Dusted the wrong field . I know you 're probably still a little confused from your hostage experience . Hostage experience ? Did something happen to you , Russ ? Years back he was kidnapped by aliens . Did all kind of experiments on him and such . Tell 'em about it , Russ . Get a few beers in him and he 'll tell you all about it . Won 't you , Russ ? Russ , when they took you up in their spaceship , did they do any ... .. sexual things ? Do you recall ? Do you recollect ? - What 's that ? - Let 's get outta here . Wow ! Mommy , look it ! It 's too early , baby . - Is it an earthquake ? - Not even a four-pointer . Go back to sleep . Daddy ! What are you doing here ? - You should be in the shelter . - What 's going on ? - Aren 't you coming , David ? - I gotta see this . The signal ! My God ! Now what do we do ? Address the nation . There 's gonna be a lot of frightened people out there . Yeah . I 'm one of ' em . Hey ! Come on ! He 's just trying to impress you . If you wanna impress me , you need to get a job and stop slobbering ' all over my shoes . I don 't believe this . Jasmine ! Neighbours are movin ' out . I guess they finally got tired of all these quakes . A little shake and they runnin ' . Police and fire departments want everyone to stay off the phone . There 's something on the news about the quake ! What 's up , man ? What you doin ' goin ' out there ? Shooting aliens . Oh , you shootin ' aliens . You think you 're tough , huh ? What you got ? Turn around . Come on , let 's get you something to eat . - Watch out ! Watch it now ! - I 'm gonna go grab the paper . Dylan ! Come on , honey . Let 's go ! Babe , you want some of this coffee ? Babe ? Pentagon officials are warning more ships have arrived over the capitals of India , England and Germany , bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15 of these city-size spacecraft . I know , Ma . Just try and stay calm . - Tell her to leave town . - Why ? What happened ? - Just do it ! - Ma , listen ! Get your stuff together and head for Aunt Esther 's . Don 't argue with me ! Just go ! David ! Why did I just send my mother to Atlanta ? David , talk to me . The signal in the satellite feed is recycling down to extinction . Didn 't you hear me ? - Not really . - Countdown . A countdown ? To what , David ? It 's like in chess . First you strategically position your pieces . Then , when the timing 's right , you strike . See ? They 're positioning themselves everywhere using one signal to synchronise their efforts . In about six hours , the signal 's gonna disappear and the countdown will be over . And then what ? Checkmate . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , I gotta call my brother . I 'd better call my housekeeper , and my lawyer ! Ah , forget my lawyer . Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States . Good afternoon . My fellow Americans , a historic and unprecedented event has occurred . The question of whether or not we 're alone in the universe has been answered . Although it 's understandable that many of us feel hesitation or fear , we must attempt to reserve judgment . He says he 's your husband . Oh , God . - What do you want ? - You gotta leave the White House . This is hardly the time to be having that old discussion . You gotta leave Washington . In case you haven 't noticed , we are having a little crisis here ! They have a hidden signal . They 're gonna attack . - You are just being paranoid ! - It 's not paranoia ! The embedding 's very subtle . It was probably overlooked ... Marty , get out of town as soon as you can . Please ? The staff and I will remain here as we attempt to communicate . If you feel compelled to leave these cities , please do so in an orderly fashion . Excuse me ! Coming through . The arrival of the aliens has caused over 10,000 fender benders in just a few seconds . But this is just the beginning ... - You can 't go ! You got to call them back ! - I 'm not gonna do this with you , Jasmine . - I 've got to report to El Toro . - You said you was on leave for the Fourth ! Well , they cancelled it ! Look , why are you acting like this ? Why ? That 's why ! Look , I really don 't think they flew 90 billion light years to come and start a fight , and get all rowdy . Why don 't you just relax ? I 'm gonna report to El Toro , find out what 's goin ' on . - What are you doin ' in there , man ? - Nothing , I 'm just drivin ' . Look . - I got these for you . - Firecrackers ! - You be careful . - Steve , wait . - I wanna tell you something . - What is it , Jasmine ? You take care of yourself , you hear ? Look , why don 't you pack some things and you and Dylan come stay with me on the base ? You will see that there is nothing to be scared of . Really ? - You don 't mind ? - Well , I mean ... I will have to let all my other girlfriends know they can 't come over . - I got to postpone a freaky weekend . - There you go , thinking you 're all that . But you are not as charming as you think you are , sir . Yes , I am . - Them big old Dumbo ears . - Look at you with them chicken legs . Come on , Dylan . Look out ! The television said they started looting . Vultures . - Do you still have the Plymouth ? - David , you don 't have a licence . - You 're driving . - Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm driving ? Come on . I really want you out of Los Angeles . You 're staying there to keep people calm . I won 't let them criticise you for it . - I appreciate your trying to help me . - Liar . Stick to the truth . You 're good at it . OK . I don 't want you in any one of those cities . I 'll leave as soon as the interviews are done . All right . A helicopter will be taking you to Nullius . - And the munchkin ? - She 'll meet you there . All right . I love you . I love you . - Bye . - Bye . It ' s the White House ! - You can 't drive up and ring a bell . - Can 't you go any faster ? You think they don 't know what you know ? She works for the President . - They know everything . - They don 't know this . You 're gonna educate them , huh ? So are you so smart ? How come you spent eight years in mit to become a cable repairman ? All I 'm saying is they got people who handle these things . If they want HBO , they 'll call you . Look at these people , look . Vultures . They take and then they go . They 're going faster than we are . We 're in the fast lane ! - They 're cutting me off . - No one 's cutting you off ! - They 're getting in front . I can 't go faster . - I don 't wanna argue . - Let 's just get there , quickly . - What 's the rush ? You think we 'll get to Washington and it won 't be there ? A crop-duster was arrested as he dropped leaflets from the air . - Everybody 's leavin ' . - Can you give us some of your time ? We 've got to stop them ! I was kidnapped by space aliens ten years ago ! They did all kinds of experiments on me ! They 've been studying us , finding out our weaknesses ! We 've gotta stop ' em . They 're gonna kill us all ! Some people attribute his behaviour to post-traumatic stress from his service as a pilot in Vietnam . Others have a more unusual theory . How would you describe Mr. Casse ? - Keeps to himself . Quiet . - Private . When they took him up in the spaceship , the aliens abused him sexually . Mr. Casse is in the county lockup ... Pack up . We 're leaving . He maybe released later tonight ... Miguel , what about Dad ? This could be our last night on Earth . You don 't wanna die a virgin , do you ? - Come on ! We 're going . - No , I 'm not goin ' anywhere . Miguel ! Stop it ! Thanks a lot , partner ! You read my mind ! Stay here . We gotta get as far away from these things as we can ! - They let you out ? - You damn right ! They got bigger fish to fry now , believe you me ! - Come on , boy ! - We 're leavin ' without you . We 're goin ' to live with Uncle Hector in Tucson . Hector ! Like hell you are ! I 'm still your father . No , you 're not . You 're just the man who married my mother . You 're nothin ' to me ! Well , what about Troy ? - Troy ? - Yeah . For once in your life , why don 't you think about what 's best for him ? Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up ? Huh ? Who ? Who ? ! You stop it right now ! I 'm not a baby any more ! I don 't want your stupid medicine because I 'm so sick of medicine ! Do you know what this stuff costs ? Do you wanna get sick again ? Do you ? The LAPD is asking Los Angelenos not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft . You may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war . Do you think we can find something better to do with our time ? Where you been , Stevie ? Man , this is unbelievable . This is , like , huge . - They 've recalled everybody . - Looks like the mail 's still working . You 'll have to do the honours for me . - You 're a wuss ! - Whatever . Shut up and read it . It says : " Captain Steven Hiller " ... loser . - Come on ! - Blah blah blah ! " We regret to inform you that despite your excellent record of service ... " I 'm sorry , man . You know what you need to do ? You need to , like , kiss some serious booty to get ahead in this world . That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . See , I like the one-knee approach , because it puts the booty , like , right in front of the lip ... - What 's this ? - That 's nothin ' . What is this ? - Jasmine kinda has a thing for dolphins . - Stevie , this is a wedding ring . I thought you said you were gonna break it off ? Well ... Man , you know I really like Jasmine . You know that , right ? Man , you never can you get to fly a spaceship if you marry spill . ... It could only happen in California . Here 's Wendy Walsh with a special report . Hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered on rooftops in Los Angeles to welcome the new arrivals . Oh , God ! I hope they bring back Elvis ! I just came in to get my check tonight and I got talked into working . Oh , I must have been trippin ' . It 's the party event of the century ! Everyone is invited , especially you-know-who . - This is so cool ! - Girl , please ! Oh , hey ! I made it before I came in . Check it out ! I know you 're not gonna join those idiots . Well ... I am going over there as soon as I get off . - Do you wanna come ? - Tiffany , listen to me a sec . I 've got a really bad feeling about this . I don 't want you to go . Oh , like the really bad feeling you got when I went to Las Vegas ? And I was right . You didn 't get the job and you lost all your money gambling . Yeah , but I wasn 't in LA for the earthquake . Tiff , I really don 't want you to go up there . Now promise me you won 't . Come on , girl ! Promise me . I promise . OK . Look , I 'm going . I 'm out of town for a while . - Later . - Bye . Hey , there 's my angel . Come on . Come on , Boomer . Let 's go . Hey , talk to your boyfriend later . Hey ! What the hell 's the kid doin ' here ? Huh ? - You try finding a sitter today . - Hey ! Where are you going ? - You leave . You 're fired . - Nice workin ' with you , Mario . Come on , Boomer . Everyone is trying to get out of Washington . We 're the only schmucks trying to get in . What the hell 's that ? Part of any phone books of Americans . You think a important person like Constance are in listing ? She always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies . Sometimes it 's her first initial , sometimes her nickname . - Sometimes just her ... - Oy , my God ! Hey , hey , hey ! Slow down ! - Pit stops ! - Tell them ! Slow down ! A ramp ! Slow down ! - We made it ! - Good . - Nice driving ' , Pops . - Well ... - So , not listed , huh ? - No , no . I just haven 't found it yet . I tried C. Spano , Connie Spano , Spunky Spano . Spunky ? - College nickname . - Cute . - You tried Levinson ? - She didn 't take my name . - Why would she ... What do you mean ? - Try it . Here . Look . So what do I know ? Hm ? So ? Do you wanna ring the bell , or should I ? - Perfect , she 's using it . - What ? It 's busy ? Yeah , I can use her signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House . - You can do that ? - Yeah . All cable repairmen can , Pops . The visitors have arrived , but the President remains at the White House . Question . Are Mr. Whitmore 's actions a ) ultra brave or b ) foolhardy ? - What ? - Don 't hang up , sweetie . David ! How did you get this number ? - Do me a favour . Walk to the window . - And I 'm looking for what ? You 'll see . Over here . See us ? How does he do that ? In light of our apparent inability to communicate with the visitors Pentagon officials have retrofit this Skylift helicopter with a visual communications device . - Mr. President . - Gentlemen , be seated . - Where are we now ? - We 're commencing lift off . .. and refitted with these enormous light panels that are attached to the hull and onto the sides . Echo One , Welcome Wagon is in the air . I repeat , Welcome Wagon is in the air . Roger , Welcome Wagon . Echo One , right beside you . This is something I would never believe that I would be ! In the White House ! If I knew I was gonna meet the President , I would have worn a tie . Look at me , I look like a schlemiel . - Oy , my God ! - David , - I don 't know if he 'll want to see you . - Then we 're wasting time , we should go . - Why wouldn 't he listen ? - Last time I saw him , we had a fight . You walked in and punched him in the head . - The President ! - He wasn 't president then . I punched him , he fought back . It was a fight ! A fight that you started ! David thought I was having an affair . - With the President ? - Which I wasn 't ! Either go get him , or we should head back . All right , I 'll get him . Wait here , and don 't touch anything ! You punched the President ? God ! Nearing point of contact , Echo One . We 're closing in . Roger that . Begin sequence when ready . This I like . Look at this ! You know what famous people have been here ? Hm ? - Politicians , actors , baseball players , singers ... And now me ! Imagine that ! " A poor immigrant like me . " - " It 's a dream ! " - Sh ! David ! The three choppers are approaching what has been unanimously agreed to be the front of these spaceships ... You 're leaving now ? Hey , see if they 've got those pens they give away . Dad , what ? I don 't have a choice ... - I don 't have time for this . - Two minutes , Tom , please . Mr. President , Julius Levinson . David is my ... - I told you he wouldn 't listen . - You have to tell him now . David , you have to tell him ! David , tell him ! I know why we have satellite disruption . All right . Go ahead . Let 's say that you wanted to coordinate with spaceships on different sides of the Earth . They couldn 't send a direct signal , right ? - You mean line of sight ? - Right . The curve of the Earth prevents it . You 'd need satellites to relay that signal in order to reach each ship . Well , I found a signal hidden inside our own satellite system . Excuse me , Mr. President . They 're starting . They 're using our own satellites against us . The clock is ticking . - Bringing it in to hover . - Welcome Wagon , Echo One . Approaching alien ship . Initiating communication sequence . Welcome Wagon has commenced . General Grey , coordinate with the Atlantic Command . Tell them to evacuate the cities . Get those helicopters away from the ship . Call them back ! - What the hell 's going on ? - We 're leaving . Kim ! My daughter . Something 's happening . They 're responding . It looks like there 's activity . This may be a response , Echo One . We see it too . Can 't identify it . We are evacuating . I repeat , we are evacuating the White House . Load the rest of the staff in the second helicopter . - Is my wife in the air ? - She will be shortly . Nice . Very nice . Good ! Close the door ! Hatch secure ! We have our own phone . Move outta here . The President 's ordered an evacuation . Our prayers go out to the pilots ' families . - Indeed , God help us all . - Mrs Whitmore . The visitors responded with terrifying ... Authorities have called for the evacuation of Los Angeles County . People are advised to avoid the highways wherever possible . Great ! Now he tells me . This is the Los Angeles Police Department . Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety . - Can we move it along ? - Dr Katz 's office . - Hello . Dr Katz , please . - I 'm sorry , he 's not available . For $ 300 an hour , you can put me through to his house in the Hamptons ! This is the Los Angeles Police Department . Please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety . Mrs Whitmore ! You must leave now . The First Lady 's secured . We 're on the move . They 're opening up ! It 's so pretty . Get the hell outta here ! Go ahead , pilot . We 're ready to take off right now . Can we get a blanket for Patricia ? Here . Time 's up . Oh , crap . Oh , my God ! Come on , Dylan ! We gotta go ! Come on , Boomer ! Boomer ! Reports are unclear as to the extent of the devastation , but it appears that Los Angeles , Washington , and New York are in ruins . Good God ! I 've been sayin ' it . I 've been sayin ' it for ten damn years ! Ain 't I , Miguel ? Huh ? I 've been sayin ' it ! Dad , I don 't feel good . Pull it over , man . - We 're gonna be all right , Troy . - Yeah , leave me alone . I got it . Miguel ! Look at all that . We could have evacuated the cities hours ago . That 's the advantage of being a fighter pilot . In the Gulf War , we knew what we had to do . This is just ... .. not simple any more . A lot of people died today . How many didn 't have to ? Any news on my wife yet ? The helicopter never made it to Nullius . No radio contact . Come on , Dylan . Stay close . Here it is . What happened , Mommy ? I don 't know , baby . You men will be the first wave in our counter attack . Our target is to the north , centred above what remains of downtown Los Angeles . Our Black Knight Squadron ... - Are you scared , man ? - Nope . - You ? - Nope . - Hold me ! - Hey , pay attention . Something you wanna add , Captain Hiller ? No , sir . Just a little anxious to whup ET 's ass , that 's all . You 'll get your chance . You 'll all get your chance . Good hunting . Dismissed ! Let 's kick the tyres and light the fires , Big Daddy ! Ready to go , sir ! Let 's bring it home . Bring that bad boy home , Captain ! - You loose ? - Yes , sir ! - Got your victory dance ? - Oh , I got it right here ... yeah ! Hey , don 't get pre-patrol on me . We don 't light up till the fat lady sings . I 'm all ears , brother ! You the man ! - All right , gentlemen , we 're on . - General , it 's NORAD . - General Grey here . - Al ? All communications with the cities are down . - All systems gone . - For intelligence , we believe it 's a total loss . How about our boys ? Where are they ? ETA to target , four minutes . - I shouldn 't have left her . - Don 't worry about it , big man . I 'm sure she got outta here before it happened . Or , as the good Reverend would say : " Why we 're on this particular mission , we 'll never know . " " But I do know , here today , that the Black Knights will emerge victorious once again . " - Amen , man ! - Amen , Reverend . Holy God ! Lock and load ! Roger that . LA attack squadron has Amraam missiles locked on target . Washington and New York squadrons report lock-on . - Fire at will . - Fire at will . Knights , we are red and free . Knight One , fox three ! Knight Three , fox three ! Knight Seven , fox three . The missiles have been fired . - Are they not getting through ? - No , not one . Command , Knight One . Switchin ' to Sidewinders , moving in . Knight Three , low 50 knots reference 120 . Knight Seven , 120 . Knight One , sweep lock . Fox two . Knight Seven ... Come on ! They must have a protective shield over the hull ! Knights , pull up ! - Knight Three , pull up ! - Complete failure in the stators ! Pull up ! Blow through ! Too many of ' em ! They got another one , sir . Oh no , you did not shoot that green shit at me ! I got ya covered , Big Daddy ! Damn , they got shields , too ! Let 's go , Knights ! Move , Knights ! Move ! Jesus ! They got another one . And two more . They 're dropping like flies . - We 're losing it . - Get ' em outta there . Squadron leaders , retreat to fallback position . Abort mission right away ! We 'll have to make a run for this one ! Let 's get low and fast ! I gotcha , Big Daddy ! Let 's get ' em ! Watch the deck ! - Squadron leader , abort ! - This isn 't happening fast enough ! Get ' em out ! - The monitor ! Where 's the picture ? - We 've lost the satellite . - We got two on our six , Jimmy . Shackle ! - Roger . Come on , come on ! Move ! - You told me , like , quite all right ! - They ain 't got nothin ' for us ! Let 's push it ! - I can 't shake ' em . - Yes , you can . Just the way I showed you . - I 'm gonna try somethin ' . - Nothin ' stupid ! - You know me ! - That 's what I mean . Jimmy , you can 't bank at that speed ! Jimmy , he 's closing on you ! - Put your mask back on ! That 's an order ! - I can 't breathe ! Jimmy ! No ! Affirmative . We have incoming . - Let me have it , son . - You got it . Friendly ? - Sergeant ? - I don 't think so . Come on and get me ! What are you shooting at ? Where you at , baby ? ! Come on ! You can 't hit nothin ' ! Low bridge ! See if you can fly that thing under cover ! Hope you got an airbag ! Son of a bitch ! This way ! This way ! Get off ! Get off of me ! That 's what you 'll get ! Look at you ! Ship all banged up ! Who 's the man ? ! Huh ? Who 's the man ? ! Wait till I get another plane ! I 'm lining ' all your friends up , right beside you ! Where you at ? Huh ? Where you at ? Welcome to Earth . That 's what I call close contact . Baby , stay right here with Boomer . Keys . Come on , keys . Yes ! Come , baby . Come on ! Reports indicate that this battle has repeated itself all over the world with the same results . You 're just like your mother , you know that ? She was stubborn , too . I had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine . - You 're gonna be all right . - You 're gonna be fine . See , Troy ? You 're feelin ' better already . I couldn 't find anything . Everyone 's packin ' up . - They said a spaceship is headed this way . - We 'd better leave , too , then . - Penicillin . It 'll help keep his fever down . - Thank you . It 's really nice of you to help us . I wish I could do more , but we 're moving out . I 'm going with you . - Well , I just mean that we 're going , too . - Cool . Tell that punk to shut the door , we 're outta here . He can sniff around somewhere else . It 's Air Force One , for crying out loud . Still he gets sick . - I don 't feel too good . - Look at me , huh ? Like a rock . Could be bad weather or good weather . We could go up or down , back or forwards , side to side ... What did I say ? - He still gets airsick , huh ? - Yeah . Julius , with all of this ... I didn 't get a chance to thank you two . All he could think of was getting to you . There 's still love there , I think . - Love was never a problem . - All you need is love . John Lennon . Smart man . Shot in the back , very sad . We 've moved as many of our forces away from our bases as possible . - But we 've already sustained heavy losses . - I spoke with the Joint Chiefs at NORAD . They agree we must counterattack with a full nuclear strike . Over American soil ? You 're saying we should sacrifice more innocent American civilians ? If we don 't strike soon , there may not be much of an America left ! Sir ! They 've taken out NORAD . - What ? - It 's gone , sir . My God ! The Vice President ? The Joint Chiefs ? Mr. President . We must launch . A delay would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities . You 're not gonna launch nuclear weapons . You 'll kill them and us . If we fire nukes ... - Sir , may I remind you .. you are a guest here ? - You ever hear of nuclear winter ? - It 's the end of life as we know it . - Just go . I don 't have to go . It can 't be allowed ! - Shut up ! Captain , get him out ! - Don 't tell him to shut up ! You 'd all be dead if it wasn 't for my David ! None of you did anything to prevent this ! There was nothing we could do . We were totally unprepared for this . - Don 't give me that ! - Come on . It was , what ? In the 1950s , you had that spaceship . - Dad . Look ... - Yeah , that thing you found in New Mexico ! - Where was that ? - Not the spaceship . Roswell , New Mexico . You had the spaceship and the bodies ! They were locked up in a bunker . Where was that ? David ! Area 51 . Right ? Area 51 . You knew then ! And you did nothing . Sir . Regardless of what you may have read in the tabloids , there have never been any spacecraft recovered by our government . Take my word for it . There 's no Area 51 . And there 's no recovered spaceship . Excuse me , Mr. President ... That 's not entirely accurate . Hold on , everybody . Hold on ! Sorry . The end hath come ! He 's spaken his word and the end hath come ! Hop on ! We 're headin ' out to El Toro ! You cannot defy what hath come ! It 's the end ! El Toro ? ! - Can you give me a hand ? - Sure . Oh , God . OK , let 's get this off . Here , let me help you . She 's hurt pretty badly . You know , this was supposed to be my weekend off . But , nooo ! You got me out here , draggin' your heavy ass through the burnin ' desert with your dreadlocks sticking ' out the back of my parachute . You gotta come down here with an attitude , actin ' all big and bad . And what the hell is that smell ? I coulda been at a barbecue ! But I ain 't mad . It 's all right , it 's all right . Do you need a lift , soldier ? When I flew overhead , I saw a base not too far from here . It ain 't on the map . Trust me , it 's there . Attention ! Mr. President . General . Welcome to Area 51 . Please follow me . We 're now 24 floors beneath the surface and here 's our main research facility . - Let 's see it . - Sorry , sir , it 's a clean room . It 's static free ... Open the door . Yes , sir . My God . Why the hell wasn 't I told about this place ? Two words , Mr. President . Plausible deniability . I don 't get it . Where does all this come from ? How do you get funding for something like this ? You don 't actually think they spend $ 20,000 on a hammer , $ 30,000 on a toilet seat , do you ? Mr. President , this is Dr Okun . He has headed up the research department on this project for the last 15 years . How do you do ? Wow ! This ... What a pleasure ! As you can imagine , they ... They don 't let us out much . I can understand that . Well ! I guess you 'd like to see the big tamale , huh ? Follow me . She 's a beaut , ain 't she ? As you can see from the repairs , we 've been trying to put her back together since the ' 60s . You 've had this for 40 years and you know nothing about ' em ? Oh , hell , no . We know tons about ' em . But the neatest stuff ... The neatest stuff has only happened in the last few days . We can 't duplicate their type of power so we 've never been able to experiment . But since these guys started showing up , all the little gizmos inside turned on . The last 24 hours have been really exciting ! Exciting ? People are dying out there . Exciting isn 't the word I 'd choose to describe it ! You 're hoping to fly this thing , huh ? You said you can repair their technology . Can you tell us anything useful about them ? Yeah . Well , I mean ... They 're not all that dissimilar from us . Breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , cold . Probably why they 're interested in our planet . Hey ... You guys wanna see ' em ? This is ... This is the vault . Or , as some of us have come to call it ... .. the freak show . When we found ' em , they were wearing some sort of biomechanical suits . Once we got ' em off , we learned a great deal about their anatomy . Eyes , ears . No vocal chords . We assume they communicate with each other by some other means . You 're obviously not thinking about hand signals and body language . It 's some kind of extrasensory perception . Telepathy . So ... It 's an organic life form . - Can they be killed ? - Their bodies are just as frail as ours . These two died in the crash . This one a few weeks later . You just have to get through their technology , which is , I 'm sorry to say , far more advanced . David , you unlocked part of their technology . - You cracked the code . - No , no . All I did was stumble on their ... .. signal . I don 't know how helpful I can be . Why don 't you show him what you 've discovered so far ? Figure out what they haven 't thought of yet . We 'll see if you 're as smart as we all hope you are . What code ? Captain Steven Hiller , US Marine Corps . I 'm sorry , Captain . You don 't have clearance . OK . Come here . You wanna see my clearance ? - Maybe I 'll just leave this here with you . - Let ' em pass . Get the hell out of the way ! Did you see that ? Come on down . Watch your step . Well , obviously this cockpit was designed to seat three . Though how they sat on them , I don 't know . Gently . You see these gizmos flashing ? We 've been workin ' around the clock trying to get a fix on all this . Some stuff we figured out right away . This we 're pretty sure is the life support for the cabin . And this doohickey is connected to ... Oh ... Well , it was connected to the engine . Here , take that , will ya ? These configurations ... Well , to be honest , we don 't know what the hell this crap is . But this is clearly what they use to guide and navigate their craft . Neat , huh ? Could somebody grab my laptop there ? Can I have the computer inside ? These patterns are repeating sequentially , like their countdown signal . They 're using that frequency for computer communications . See ? That 's how they 're coordinating their ships . You know ... You 're really starting to make us look bad . They got one ! They got one alive ! - They got one . Alive ! - Jesus ! You 'll be OK by yourself , Dave ? - Fine . - Don 't touch anything . Everybody 's always telling me not to touch anything . Oh ! It 's all wet . Right here ! In the back of the pickup . General , sir . Captain Steven Hiller , United States Marine Corps . Guess who 's comin ' to dinner ! I need a doctor . I need a doctor ! Oh , boy ! - How long has he been unconscious ? - About three hours . - Let 's get him in containment . - My son is very sick . He needs attention ! He 's drying out . I want him sprayed down with saline . He has a problem with his adrenal cortex ! Please ! If you don 't do something right now , my son will die ! - Just help him ! - Okay . O 'Haver , Miller , you come with us . You , take us to him , OK ? Let 's go . All right . Move it ! As the former head of the ClA , you knew about this place . - When were you planning to inform us ? - It had been deemed classified . You should have told us about this when they first arrived ! We wouldn 't have launched a counterattack that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots ! We could not have known that our fighters would 've been that ineffective ! Mr. President . The little bit of information we have comes directly into this room . Atlanta , Chicago , and Philadelphia . Destroyed . NATO and Western Allied installations were the first to be taken out . Then we were hit . They knew exactly where and how to hit us . - And our forces ? - We 're down to 15 % . If you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on , we 're looking at the worldwide destruction of every major city in the next 36 hours . We 're being exterminated . Mr. President ! This is Captain Steven Hiller . - Captain . - Mr. President . Well done . - Where is it now ? - It 's isolated in the containment lab , sir . I 'd like to go see it . General , I 'm really anxious to get back to El Toro . Hasn 't anyone told you ? El Toro has been completely destroyed . We were lucky . Today was the first time I used the subway . Thank God for the Metro Rail . These should last us a while . Don 't move . I 'll get it for you . Stay still . - He 's your son ? - He 's my angel . Was his father stationed here ? Nah , he ... He wasn 't his father . But I was kinda hopin he wanted the job , though . - So what do you do for a living ? - I 'm a dancer . - Ballet . - No . Exotic . - Sorry . - Don 't be . I 'm not . It 's good money . Besides my baby 's worth it . Dylan ! Come here . I want you to meet the First Lady . - Hello . - Hi . I didn 't know that you 'd recognised me . Well , I didn 't want to say nothin ' . I voted for the other guy . - Life-support monitors recording . - So if we screw up , it 's all on tape . Come on . Let 's get this biomechanical suit off . Put the spreader right here , along the ridge . Microprobe thing a majig goes right here . Pick there . Good . All right , now spread it very , very gently . Let me get in . Gentle , gentle , that 's it . Run this right in ... All right . Let 's proceed . Now comes the really icky part . Oh , boy . This is one smelly , disgusting ... Look at it . It doesn 't look alive , does it ? The arm is moving . Doctor ? Doctor ? Doctor ? Don 't move ! Dr Okun ? Release me . - Open the door . Get him out ! - No , wait . Release me . I know there is much we can learn from each other if we can negotiate a truce . We can find a way to coexist . Can there be a peace between us ? Peace . No peace . What is it you want us to do ? Die . Die ! Mr. President . - Is that glass bulletproof ? - No , sir . - Are you all right ? - I saw his thoughts . I saw what they 're planning to do . They 're like locusts . They 're moving from planet to planet . Their whole civilisation . After they 've consumed every natural resource , they move on . And we 're next . Nuke ' em . Let 's nuke the bastards . Just my luck . No ice . I take it you 've heard ? Hey , toast . - To the end of the world . - He didn 't come to this decision lightly . He didn 't have any other choice . - Well , you still believe in him . - Well , he 's a good man . He 'd better be . You left me for him . Or , you know ... for your career . You know , it wasn 't just my career . It was the biggest opportunity of my life . I wanted my life to make a difference . I wanted my life to mean something . And ... I wasn 't ... ambitious enough for you ? David , you could have done anything you wanted . Research , development ... I was happy where I was . Haven 't you ever wanted to be part of something special ? I was part of something special . Well , if it makes any difference , I never stopped loving you . But that wasn 't enough , was it ? Let 's pick it up , man . Let 's go ! Let 's pick it up , man ! We 're on a tight schedule ! Pick it up , man ! Pick it up ! What the hell are you doin ' ? Get outta there ! I got something I gotta handle . I 'm borrowing ' it . - No , you 're not , sir . - Do you really wanna shoot me ? Just tell ' em I hit you . Command , this is Retal Op. Squadron is in the air . We are on station and awaiting instructions . Break formation . Head to targets . Sir . They 're breaking formation . - We 're initiating sequence code . - Verification : Alpha Zulu six eight niner . Which city will be reached first ? Houston , Texas . ETA , six minutes and counting down . - Houston . - The major cities have been deserted . Civilian casualties should be down to a minimum . Command , this is Neighbourhood Watch . We are in position . Tracking monitors are locked on . We are going to visual recon . Roger . - We have confirmation . - Launch code confirmed . Alpha Zulu six eight niner , standing by . Laser targeting . Locked on . We 're locked on , sir . Do you wish to deploy ? Mr. President , if you wish to deploy , the time is now . - Mr. President ? - Deploy . That 's a go . Alpha Zulu six eight niner . Here we go . Bird 's away . We have visual confirmation of the missile . It 's on target . Approaching . May our children forgive us . Five seconds to impact . Three , two , one . It 's a hit ! Get down ! Get down ! Can we confirm that the target was destroyed ? Get the tank commander . Confirm the target was destroyed . Red Arrow , Alpha 9723 . Can you read ? - Repeat . You 're breaking up . - We have lost visual . Roger that . We 're looking for confirmation . We got the bastards . Good job , everyone ! Congratulations . Commander , do you have visual ? We need visual confirmation . Has the target been destroyed ? Negative . Target remains . I repeat , target remains . Call the other planes back . The others might have more luck . We shouldn 't give up ! I said call them back ! - Abort . - Abort mission . Issue the abort codes right away . This is an abort , full abort . Do you read ? Jasmine ! You 're late ! You know I like to make an entrance . - Where are we going ? - Through there , sir . Mr. President . Your wife is resting comfortably for the moment . - Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier ... - Hey , there she is ! Go on ! - She doesn 't look too good . - Your wife is bleeding internally . - Perhaps if we 'd gotten to her earlier ... - What are you saying ? We can 't stop the bleeding . If we 'd ... There 's nothing we can do for her . We were worried . We didn 't know where you were . - You 've gotten bigger , I think . - I did ? You just keep growing and growing . I can 't ... Hey . Can you wait outside for a little bit so Mom can get a rest ? Come on , Munchkin . I 'm so sorry that I didn 't come home when you asked me to . It 's OK . The doctors ... .. think that you 're ... gonna be just fine . Liar . Is Mommy sleeping now ? Yeah . Mommy 's sleeping . David ! - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm makin ' a mess ! Yeah . This I can see . We gotta burn this toxic waste , pollute the air and rip up the ozone ! Cos maybe if we screw this planet up enough ... .. they won 't want it any more . Wait . David . - Don 't do this to yourself . Listen to me . - I 'm listening . Everyone loses faith at some point in their life . Even myself . I haven 't spoken to God since your mother died . You see , sometimes we have to remember what we still have . Like what ? Well , you still have your health . David , you need your rest . Come on ! Get off this freezing floor before you catch cold . Come on ! - What did you just say ? - About faith ? - Well , you see , a man ... - No . - The other part . - What ? I don 't want you to catch cold . What is that ? What is the matter with you ? - Genius . - Genius ? My dad . A total genius . Jerry , wake up . We got work to do . Get everybody down here right away . - Look at that ! - Wow ! - Does that thing really fly in outer space ? - It most certainly does . - Sure doesn 't look like it . - They 're here . - All right , what 's this all about ? - I have no idea . Get everybody off . Right , clear the platform . Let 's go . - Major Mitchell . Do you have a pistol ? - What ? - Have you got a gun ? - Sergeant , your sidearm . See that Coke can on top of the alien craft ? Think you can shoot that thing off ? - Shoot it . - Sir ? Go ahead . - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . My fault . That Coke can was protected by the craft 's shield . - We can 't penetrate it . - What 's your point ? My point is , if we can 't beat their defences , then we gotta get around them . Major . One more time ... Any time . - How did you do that ? - I gave it a cold . I gave it a virus . A computer virus . Are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields ? Just like they used our satellites against us , we can use their own signal against them . If we plant a virus into that mother ship , it 's gonna filter down into all the corresponding ships below . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . How exactly do we infect the mother ship with this virus ? We 're ... We 're gonna have to ... fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it . We can enter here , as shown in these satellite photos . We then upload the virus , set off some kind of explosion which 'll disable it . That 'll disorient the smaller ships below and that could buy you some time to ... to take ' em ... take ' em out . Take ' em down . Do your ... Do your stuff . - This is ridiculous ! - How long would their shields be down ? Eh ... I dunno . A matter of minutes . You want us to coordinate a counterstrike with a window of a few minutes ? - With shields down , it might be possible . - Oh , please ! We don 't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign ! Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan depends on a machine that no one in this world is qualified to operate . I wouldn 't say that , sir . I 've seen them in action . I 'm aware of their manoeuvring capabilities . With your permission , General , I 'd like the opportunity to try . That thing is a wreck . It crash-landed in the ' 50s . We don 't even know if it 's capable of flying ! Jim , remove the clamps . Any questions ? Let 's do it . All right , you heard the President ... - Good luck , pilot . - Thank you , Mr. President . A virus . Your idea . That 's right . Do you really think you can fly that thing ? Do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said ? I understand you are upset over your wife 's death . But that 's no excuse for making another fatal mistake . No , my mistake was to appoint a snivelling weasel like you as Secretary of Defense . - You don 't understand ! - However , that is one mistake I am thankful to say that I don 't have to live with . - Mr. President ... - Mr. Nimsiki , you 're fired . Let 's organise every plane we can find and get us some goddamn pilots to fly ' em . - Yes , sir . - He can 't do that . Well , he just did . Command has attempted to list casualties and losses , but information is sketchy . We know they 've lost the Belgian contingent in the Sinai . There 's a strong possibility reinforcements are hiding in the Golan Straits . - What is he saying ? - They 're getting a signal . Old Morse code . It 's from the Americans . They want to organise a counteroffensive ! It 's about bloody time ! What do they plan to do ? We have confirmed reports of combat-ready divisions - in Europe , the Middle East , and Asia . - Impressive . Considering it 's all done with ... Morse code . - The armed forces here ? - We have sufficient aircraft , but ... - But what ? - Pilots are comin ' up short . Well , then , find ' em . Ham radio operators from New York to Japan trade rumours of military forces in hiding , unwilling to reveal themselves for fear of annihilation ... We 're planning to launch a counter offensive . With our depleted manpower , we 're asking that anyone with flight experience come forward . Military training is preferable , but anyone who can fly would be useful . I can fly . I 'm a pilot . All right , guys ! Listen up ! Pay attention . These F-18s are very different than the jets you piloted . - It 's strong . - Forgive the expression , but this is a crash course in modern avionics . - Keep it comin ' . - OK , you got it ! All right , listen up . First we need some background information on your experience . Let 's start with you . Who , me ? Well , I 'm Russell Casse , sir . And after ' Nam I got into crop-dusting . And been doing that ever since . On a personal note , sir , I 'd just like to add that ever since I was kidnapped by aliens 10 years ago , I have been dyin ' for some payback . I just want you to know that I won 't let you down . You have one tactical nuclear missile we 're loading into this launcher under the right wing . This is the firing mechanism . It 'll be attached to the ship 's main console . Just like the Amraam launch pad on a Stealth . Except the nuke will not detonate at impact . You 'll have 30 seconds to get your asses out ofthere . Good luck , gentlemen . 30 seconds . It 's the strongest radio transmitter we had . It 'll tell us when you 've uploaded the virus . 30 seconds . Don 't you think that 's cutting it too close ? We 're gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off . Why you ? David ! I don 't understand why you can 't show someone else how to plant the virus . No . Something may go wrong . I may have to think quickly , adjust the signal . Who knows ? Hey , you know how I 'm always trying to save the planet ? Here 's my chance . Now he gets ambitious . - It 's too tight . - Well , I had to borrow it . Let me see . OK . All right , I guess that 's good enough . So . How do I look ? Oh , thank you . You 're a lot of help . - You 're late ! - Well , you know me . I know . You like to make a big entrance . Listen . Before we do this , I just wanna say I 'm sorry . Sorry for what , babe ? I should have done this a long time ago . - Do you have the ring ? - Yes , sir . Here , make yourself useful . Witnesses ? - We got hung up . - Well , let 's get this show on the road . Dearly beloved , we 're gathered here in the sight of God and in the presence of these witnesses to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony . Any person who can show good cause why these two should not wed , please speak now or for ever hold your peace . Steve , will you take this woman to be your wedded wife , to live together with her in the holy state of matrimony ? Will you love her , comfort her , honour and keep her in sickness and in health , and , forsaking all others , keep yourself only for her as long as you both shall live ? I will . Good morning . They 're a little young . That they are . They look a little nervous . I need all flight crews to report to their designated areas . - Major . Can I borrow that ? - Sir . Good morning . Good morning . In less than an hour , aircraft from here will join others from around the world . And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind . Mankind . That word should have new meaning for all of us today . We can 't be consumed by our petty differences any more . We will be united in our common interest . Perhaps it 's fate that today is the Fourth of July . And you will once again be fighting for our freedom . Not from tyranny , oppression or persecution . But from annihilation . We 're fighting for our right to live . To exist . And should we win the day , the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday , but as the day when the world declared in one voice , " We will not go quietly into the night ! " " We will not vanish without a fight ! " " We 're going to live on ! " " We 're going to survive ! " Today , we celebrate our Independence Day ! - Let 's go ! - Mr. President . Right this way , sir . - I 've got your gear over here . - Good luck ! I 've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is here . You 've got your choice of helmets . Mr. President , I 'd sure like to know what you 're doing . I 'm a combat pilot , Will . I belong in the air . OK , sir . Let 's get you airborne . As soon as I get back , we 're gonna light those fireworks , right ? Here . Take these . Just in case . Where 's ... Just in case . I 'm very proud of you . Be careful , OK ? It 's time . - I love you . - I love you . Oh , damn ! Wait a minute . - We gotta find some cigars . I can 't ... - Here ! Take these . My last two . You are a lifesaver . Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing ! - Missile launch . - Oh , crap ! What do I hit ? Which one ? I picked a hell of a day to quit drinkin ' . This is our victory dance . Not until the fat lady sings . Oh . Yes , OK . - This is important . - Fat lady . I gotcha . Open launch tunnel . Shaky , huh ? ls it gonna do this the whole way ? Make sure your seat backs are in their upright position . Yeah . Is it ? Let 's rock 'n'roll . Oops . Oops ? What does that mean ? No , I got it . Some jerk didn 't put the thing ... What do you mean , saying " oops " there ? What do you say we try that one again , huh ? Yes , without the " oops " . Thataway ! I have got to get me one of these ! - What was that ? Don 't do that ! - Just tryin ' to get a feel for the old girl . No , don 't . Leave her alone . - Look , no hands ! - Steve ! - You 're all secure , sir . - Grey , do you read me ? Roger , Eagle One . Your primary target has shifted course . - Which way they headed ? - I think our secret 's out . They 're headed straight for us . ETA , 26 minutes . - You still with me over there ? - What the hell was I thinking ? I 've been waiting for this my whole life . Head straight for it . - What the hell ? - Don 't touch ' em . Don 't ! I was counting on this . They are bringing us in . - When the hell was you gonna tell me ? - Oops . We 've got to work on our communication . - We have visual . - Do not engage until we 've confirmed - the package has been delivered . - Roger . Major , what happens if that thing gets here before the virus is planted ? This facility 's buried deep within a mountain . - It should provide us some protection . - Great . What about the people outside ? Lieutenant Sell ? We got incoming . Oh , my God . Look at that . There must be thousands of ' em . Millions . What the hell are they doing ? Looks like they 're preparing an invasion . Hey , I don 't like this ! This is stupid . They can see us . No . This thing comes fully loaded . AM / FM radio , reclining bucket seats and power windows . Come on , baby . We 're in . Do it . Do it . Sir , he 's uploading the virus . Eagle One , the package is being delivered . Stand by to engage . Roger . Eagle One , check left . Listen up ! We have an emergency situation . We need you to grab everything you can . Only what you can carry . We need to get you inside immediately . The virus is in . All we can do now is pray . - Delivery complete . Engage . - Delivery complete . It 's a go ! Eagle One . Fox three . Gentlemen , this is it . Come on , come on . Virus ineffective . Disengage . - Get your people out . - Disengage . Rear flank , follow suit . Hold on , Command . - I want another shot at it . - Sir , I strongly recommend you disengage . Eagle One . Fox three . - Direct hit ! - It 's a hit ! Squadron leaders , fire at will ! We 're going in . Squadron leaders , take flight . - Eagle Six at seven . - Eagle Five at three . Eagle One . Fox two . Eagle Twenty ! Fox two ! Evasive manoeuvres ! Squadron leaders , evasive manoeuvres ! Prepare to engage ! All right , Mr. President ! Here we go ! All right , baby . I 've gotcha ! Payback 's a bitch , ain 't it ? OK . Job 's done . Let 's go home . Gladly . - What 's up ? - It 's stuck . - What ? - It 's not responding . It 's stuck . Try it again . Come on ! Come on ! Inside ! - Go to the elevator ! - Hurry ! Steve ! - What are you doin ' ? - They 're overriding the system . Oh , shit ! Hide . Everybody hold someone 's hand . Hold hands . Come on in . - I 'm not Jewish . - Nobody 's perfect . God ! Where are they ? This could be our last night on Earth . I don 't wanna die a virgin . If we do , we 'll both die virgins . But at least we 'll be together . Are you scared ? Me , too . Eagle Seven , fox two . Eagle Three , fox two . We 're running out of missiles , sir . We 're not causing enough damage . It 's directly over us . They 're preparing to fire their primary weapon ! Then let 's take it out before it takes us out . Target at 12 o 'clock ! My God ! They 're everywhere ! - Bandits on our tail ! Locked on ! - I see ' em . Squadron leaders , I want a weapons check ! You 're outta time ! Disable it now ! I 'm in range . Locking on . I 've got tone . Eagle One , fox two ! That is an NI . Negative impact . I 'm out of missiles . Eagle Two ! I 'm on it .

 [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Grunts ] ALL RIGHT , EVERYONE . WE 'VE RUN OUT OF TIME . THAT 'S ALL FOR TONIGHT . IF YOU HAVEN 'T FINISHED , YOU 'LL HAVE MORE TIME WITH PETER NEXT WEEK . HEY , MAN ! EXCUSE ME . [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Glass Object Clinks And Rolls ] [ Groans ] [ Gasps , Screams ] [ Alarm Buzzing ] [ Alarm Cuts Off ] F.B.I. ! STAY WHERE YOU ARE ! KEEP THE LIGHT ON HIM ! JOHN MOSTOW , WE HAVE A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST . YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT . [ Mostow Yelling ] IF YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT , ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU . YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY . YOU 'RE HURTING ME ! DO YOU UNDERSTAND EACH OF THESE RIGHTS THAT I HAVE EXPLAINED TO YOU ? DO YOU WISH TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT ? AAH ! GOD ! HE BIT ME . THE SON OF A BITCH BIT ME LIKE A DOG ! GET HIM OUT OF HERE ! YOU OKAY ? YEAH , YEAH . [ Mostow Yelling ] [ Men Shouting ] MY GOD . [ Mulder ] JOHN MOSTOW . UNEMPLOYED HOUSEPAINTER . DIVORCED . NO CHILDREN . HE CAME TO THE U.S. FROM UZBEKISTAN DURING PERESTROIKA . HE FAILED TO MENTION ON HIS I.N.S. APPLICATION ... THAT HE SPENT THE BETTER PART OF HIS 20s IN AN INSANE ASYLUM . HE WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK FOR THE SERIAL MURDERS OF AT LEAST SEVEN MEN . YOU THOUGHT ALL THEY PRODUCED WERE GREAT HOCKEY PLAYERS . THE CRIMES TOOK PLACE DURING A THREE-YEAR PERIOD . ALL THE VICTIMS MALE , AGE 17 TO 25 . WAS THERE A SIGNATURE OR A DEFINING M.O. ? WELL , ACCORDING TO THE M.E. , THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SEXUAL ASSAULT . DEATH WAS CAUSED BY MASSIVE BLOOD LOSS DUE TO FACIAL MUTILATION . HE ALSO REPORTED THAT THE WOUND PATTERN ON ALL THE VICTIMS WAS IDENTICAL . - IT 'S ALL THERE ON PAGE THREE . - [ Flipping Pages ] " BOTH EYES PUNCTURED . SIGNATURE GASHES FROM THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH TO THE EARS . " THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND OVERKILL HERE ... WOULD SUGGEST THE WORK OF A VERY ANGRY INDIVIDUAL . POSSESSION IS A COMMON CLAIM BY CRIMINALS WHO HAVE DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS . IT 'S HOW THEY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR ACTIONS . THAT WAS THE OPERATIONAL OPINION UNTIL LAST NIGHT , WHEN A 19-YEAR-OLD MALE ... WAS FOUND DEAD SIX MILES FROM HERE WITH AN IDENTICAL SET OF FACIAL WOUNDS . - A COPYCAT ? - ACCORDING TO ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER , WHO ASKED US TO LOOK INTO THIS , THE DETAILS OF THE MUTILATIONS WERE NEVER RELEASED . ONLY MEMBERS OF THE CRIME TEAM WOULD HAVE HAD THAT INFORMATION . AND MOSTOW 'S BEEN IN CUSTODY FOR FIVE DAYS . AH . PLEASE ! THE LIGHT HURTS MY EYES . [ Door Buzzes ] LEAVE ME ALONE . YOU HAVE A NICE , SOFT BUNK . WHY AREN 'T YOU USING IT ? 'CAUSE HE 'S BEEN WORKING- - HAVEN 'T YOU , JOHN ? WHAT IS IT ? WHAT IS THIS THING ? IT KILLED THOSE MEN . DOES IT HAVE A NAME ? DOES IT HAVE A NAME TO GO WITH THAT FACE ? ALL MEN KNOW ITS NAME . WHAT DO YOU CALL IT ? SATAN ? THE DEVIL ? - OR MAYBE IT 'S JUST THE NAME OF YOUR ACCOMPLICE . - I HAD NO ACCOMPLICE . YOU KILLED ALL THOSE YOUNG MEN YOURSELF ? ITKILLED THEM . HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU ? WELL , ITSFINGERPRINTS WEREN 'T ON THE MURDER WEAPON . YOURS WERE . AND IT WON 'T BE TRIED FOR SEVEN MURDERS UNDER THE DEATH PENALTY . WHICH IS WHY IT LAUGHS AT FOOLS LIKE YOU . AND YOU . FOOLS WHO WOULD PRETEND ... EVIL CAN BE BROUGHT TO HEEL LIKE A BRINDLE BITCH ... OR BE HELD BY YOUR PATHETIC GULAGS , WHILE , WITH A SNAP OF ITS FINGER , IT MAKES MEN LICK THE GREASY FLOOR OF HELL ... JUST TO SEE ITS REFLECTION . IS THAT WHAT IT DID LAST NIGHT , JOHN ? SNAPPED ITS FINGERS AND LET ANOTHER YOUNG MAN DIE ? IT KILLED AGAIN ? YESTERDAY ? IT 'S FOUND SOMEBODY . SOMEBODY NEW . JUST LIKE IT FOUND ME . [ Door Buzzes ] AGENT MULDER , CAN I SEE YOU TWO OUTSIDE ? [ Door Shuts ] SO WHAT IS IT , MULDER ? LITTLE GREEN MEN ? EVIL SPIRITS ? HOUNDS OF HELL ? SCULLY , THIS IS BILL PATTERSON . HE RUNS THE INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT UNIT OUT OF QUANTICO . I KNOW . BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE . YOU WROTE THE BOOK . IT 'S AN HONOR , SIR . IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK TOO ? THAT THE SUSPECT IS POSSESSED BY SOME DARK SPIRIT ? NO . NOT AT ALL , SIR . STRANGE COMPANY YOU KEEP , THEN . [ Sighs ] THAT 'S WHAT ALWAYS AMAZED ME ABOUT YOU , BILL- - HOW YOU NEVER FIT YOUR OWN PROFILE . NO ONE WOULD EVER GUESS HOW REALLY MEAN-SPIRITED YOU ARE . THE ARREST OF JOHN MOSTOW IS THE RESULT OF THREE YEARS OF HARD WORK BY MY UNIT . THREE YEARS . YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WE WERE AWFUL UPSET BY THIS LATEST MURDER ... AND BY THE SUSPECT FLOATING THIS POSSESSION THEORY . YOU THINK HE 'S GOT AN ACCOMPLICE , THEN , EVEN THOUGH YOUR OWN PROFILE OF MOSTOW SAYS THAT HE 'S MOST CERTAINLY WORKING ALONE . MY PROFILE LED TO HIS ARREST . NO . HE ACTED ALONE . AND THAT MURDER LAST NIGHT WAS DONE BY A SECOND KILLER , ANDHEACTED ALONE TOO . WHAT ABOUT THESE DRAWINGS OF MOSTOW 'S ? THESE GARGOYLES ? YOU KNOW WHY HE DRAWS THOSE ? DID YOU ASK HIM ? I DIDN 'T GET A CHANCE TO . HE SAYS HE DRAWS THEM TO KEEP THIS DEMON OF HIS AWAY . THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE . HISTORICALLY , THAT 'S WHAT GARGOYLES HAVE BEEN USED FOR- - TO WARD OFF EVIL SPIRITS , LIKE ON THE EVES OF CHARTRES AND NOTRE DAME . I DON 'T NEED A HISTORY LESSON . AND I DON 'T NEED ANYONE INDULGING THIS GUY 'S STORY . I WAS ASKED TO LOOK INTO THIS CASE . IF YOU 'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT , YOU TAKE IT UP WITH A.D. SKINNER . SO YOU 'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME WHEN YOUR LOVE AFFAIR WITH PATTERSON ENDED ? PATTERSON NEVER LIKED ME . I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY WHEN YOU JOINED . NOT BY PATTERSON . WHY NOT ? DIDN 'T WANNA GET MY KNEES DIRTY . COULDN 'T QUITE CAST MYSELF IN THE ROLE OF THE DUTIFUL STUDENT . YOU MEAN YOU COULDN 'T WORSHIP HIM . SOMETHING LIKE THAT . YEAH . WELL , FROM WHAT I HEAR , THERE WERE A LOT OF MEN WHO DID . A LOT OF MEN JOINED THE F.B.I. BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE HIM . YEAH . PATTERSON HAD THIS SAYING ABOUT TRACKING A KILLER : IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW AN ARTIST , YOU HAD TO LOOK AT HIS ART . WHAT HE REALLY MEANT WAS IF YOU WANTED TO CATCH A MONSTER , YOU HAD TO BECOME ONE YOURSELF . [ Scully ] IN THIS CASE , I 'D SAY IT SERVED HIM PRETTY WELL . THIS GUY IS DEFINITELY SOME KIND OF MONSTER . - [ Screeches ] - [ Gasps ] - IT 'S JUST A CAT . - [ Exhales Deeply ] I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THESE PICTURES COMING TO LIFE . OUR GUYS MUST 'VE LOCKED IT IN HERE . PSST , PSST . NO . HE 'S OBVIOUSLY GOT HIS OWN KEY TO THE PLACE . THERE 'S AIR COMING THROUGH HERE . MUST BE SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL . [ Knocking ] IT 'S A DOOR . [ Creaks ] WHY DON 'T YOU WAIT ' TIL WE CAN GET SOME MORE LIGHT IN HERE ? I 'VE GOT SOME LIGHT . [ Slow Footsteps ] [ Scully ] SEE ANYTHING ? MORE GARGOYLES , SCULLY . LOTS OF ' EM . SCULPTED IN CLAY . WHY WOULD HE KEEP ' EM IN A SECRET ROOM ? MULDER ? MULDER , WHAT IS IT ? WHAT DO YOU SEE ? MULDER . CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT 'S GOING ON IN THERE ? [ Clanking ] [ Growls ] [ Screams ] NO ! [ Cardiograph Machine Beeping ] [ Woman ] WE 'RE MONITORING HIM VERY CLOSELY , AGENT NEMHAUSER , BUT I 'M NOT TOO ENCOURAGED BY WHAT I 'M SEEING . THE MAN IS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE . THANK YOU , DOCTOR . AGENT SCULLY . WE 'VE TURNED MOSTOW 'S STUDIO UPSIDE DOWN . THERE DON 'T APPEAR TO BE ANY MORE BODIES . HOW MANY WERE RECOVERED ? FIVE . ALL OF THEM DISMEMBERED . ALL YOUNG MEN WHOSE FACES WERE MUTILATED- - JUST LIKE THE LATEST VICTIM , I HEAR . AT LEAST THIS ONE 'S STILL ALIVE . SAME SIGNATURE FACIAL MUTILATION , RIGHT DOWN TO THE WEAPON , BY THE LOOK OF IT . - WHAT DOES PATTERSON HAVE TO SAY ? - I HAVEN 'T SPOKEN WITH HIM YET , BUT I BET HE 'S GONNA COME TO THE IDEA IT 'S SOMEONE WORKING WITH MOSTOW . WELL , I 'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT THEORY . WHAT 'S AGENT MULDER THINK ? HE THINKS OUR FINDING MOSTOW 'S SECRET GALLERY ISN 'T GONNA DO HIM ANY FAVORS WITH PATTERSON . BETWEEN YOU AND ME , I THINK PATTERSON WENT TO SKINNER AND REQUESTED MULDER ON THIS CASE . HE REQUESTED HIM ? I 'VE BEEN WORKING WITH PATTERSON FOR THREE YEARS ON THIS , AND THIS JUST ABOUT KILLED HIM , UNTIL WE FINALLY GOT A BREAK AND ARRESTED MOSTOW . BUT THEN THIS FIRST COPYCAT MURDER REALLY THREW HIM FOR A LOSS . MULDER 'S UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT PATTERSON NEVER THOUGHT TOO HIGHLY OF HIM . THAT 'S JUST PATTERSON . LATE NIGHT , A COUPLE OF BEERS IN HIM , HE STARTS TELLING ME MULDER STORIES , HOW HE 'S SOME KIND OF CRACK GENIUS . STITCHES . WHAT HAPPENED ? TSK . MOSTOW BIT ME DURING THE ARREST . HOW 'S OUR VICTIM ? HAS HE BEEN ABLE TO I.D. HIS ATTACKER ? DOCTORS SAY IT 'S STILL TOO EARLY TO EVEN TRY- - NOT IN THE CONDITION HE 'S IN . - [ Gurgling ] - THEY 'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF HE 'S GONNA MAKE IT . WHERE 'S MULDER ? HE WAS GONNA GO SEE ABOUT THOSE DRAWINGS OF MOSTOW 'S . WHAT 'S HE LOOKING FOR ? I THINK THE SAME THING YOU ARE , SIR : A SECOND KILLER . [ Cardiograph Machine Beeping Faster ] - [ Gurgling ] - I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CONVERSATION OUTSIDE . [ Grunting ] - [ Grunts ] - STAY WITH US . [ Mulder Thinking ] THE NAME IS FROM THE FRENCH " GARGOUILLE " - - THE NAME OF A MEDIEVAL DRAGON WHICH PROWLED THE RIVER SEINE , WHOSE HORRIBLE IMAGE BECAME A SYMBOL OF THE SOULS OF THE CONDEMNED TURNED TO STONE ... OR OF THE DEVILS AND DEMONS OF THE UNDERWORLD SPARED ETERNAL DAMNATION . THE EMBODIMENT OF THE LESSER FORCES OF THE UNIVERSE ... WHO INSPIRED DREAD AND THE THREAT OF OUR OWN DAMNATION . USHERS INTO HELL OR INTO THE REALM OF OUR OWN DARK FEARS AND IMAGINATION . FOR OVER 1,200 YEARS , THE GROTESQUE IMAGE HAS FOUND ITS EXPRESSION ... IN STONE , CLAY , WOOD , OIL , AND CHARCOAL- - BORN AGAIN AND AGAIN , AS IF RESURRECTING ITSELF BY ITS OWN WILL ... THROUGH TORTURED HUMAN EXPRESSION . ALMOST AS IF IT EXISTED , HAUNTING MEN INWARDLY SO THAT IT MIGHT HAUNT MANKIND FOR ETERNITY ... AS IT MUST 'VE HAUNTED JOHN MOSTOW . BUT WHAT IMPULSES MOVED HIM TO KILL ? COULD THIS BE THE SAME DARK FORCE AT WORK , ITS ULTIMATE EXPRESSION THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FLESH , OF THE VERY HAND THAT CREATES IT ? IS THIS EVIL SOMETHING BORN IN EACH OF US , CROUCHING IN THE SHADOW OF EVERY HUMAN SOUL , WAITING TO EMERGE , A MONSTER THAT VIOLATES OUR BODIES AND TWISTS OUR WILL TO DO ITS BIDDING ? [ Continues Thinking ] IS THIS THE MONSTER CALLED MADNESS ? [ Gasps ] THEY 'RE CLOSING UP IN A FEW MINUTES . SO , IS THIS HOW YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR THE SECOND KILLER ? TELL ME , MULDER , WHAT DO YOU REALLY EXPECT TO FIND HERE ? I 'M NOT SURE YET . BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA , SOME KIND OF THEORY . I 'VE GOT A FEW THEORIES . I 'M TRYING TO STITCH THEM TOGETHER RIGHT NOW . WITH YOUR FACE STUCK IN A LIBRARY BOOK ? YOU SAID IT YOURSELF . IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ARTIST , LOOK AT THE ART . I 'M FINALLY AGREEING WITH YOU . I KNOW WHERE YOU 'RE GOING WITH THIS , MULDER , BECAUSE I 'VE BEEN THERE MYSELF- - SO I CAN TELL YOU YOU 'RE WASTING YOUR TIME . MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME WHY THIS MAN WAS COMPELLED TO DRAW ... AND SCULPT THE SAME FACE AGAIN AND AGAIN , WHY HE 'S STILL DOING IT NOW . BECAUSE HE 'S INSANE . THIS IS NOTHING BUT THE SCRAWLING OF A MADMAN . HE SAID THIS THING WANTS TO SEE ITS OWN REFLECTION . MOSTOW HAS SAID EVERYTHING BUT WHAT I NEED TO HEAR- - THE NAME OF HIS ACCOMPLICE . - UNLESS HE 'S TELLING THE TRUTH . - ABOUT BEING POSSESSED ? I HAVE TO TELL YOU . I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU . WELL , I WOULDN 'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU BY NOT DISAPPOINTING YOU . AFTER ALL THIS TIME , I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU 'D FINALLY PUT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND . CLEARLY , I WAS MISTAKEN . [ Door Opening , Shutting ] [ Knocking ] [ Scully ] MULDER ? MULDER , IT 'S ME . [ Keys Jangle ] MULDER ? [ Voices Whispering ] [ Whispering Continues ] [ Gasps ] [ Gunshot ] [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Animalistic Grunting ] - [ Growls ] - [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] [ Scully ] YOU WEREN 'T AT HOME , IN YOUR OFFICE . I WAS SCARED , MULDER . I DIDN 'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE . I KEPT TRYING YOUR CELL PHONE , BUT YOU DIDN 'T ANSWER . IT WAS TURNED OFF . YOU TURNED YOUR PHONE OFF ? WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER CARRYING IT ? YOU 'RE ALL SET . YOU 'LL WANT TO SEE A DOCTOR TOMORROW IN CASE OF INFECTION . - THANKS . - [ Man ] SURE . MULDER , YOU STILL HAVEN 'T TOLD ME WHAT YOU WERE DOING IN MOSTOW 'S STUDIO . I WAS WORKING . AT 3 : 30 IN THE MORNING ? MULDER , I HAVEN 'T SEEN OR SPOKEN TO YOU IN ALMOST TWO DAYS NOW . YOU HAVEN 'T BEEN RETURNING MY PHONE CALLS . THIS THING EXISTS . IT 'S REAL . " IT " ? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? WHATEVER KEEPS KILLING THOSE YOUNG MEN . MOSTOW KILLED THOSE MEN , AND OUT OF SOME SICK ALLIANCE , SOME OTHER PERSON IS CONTINUING WHERE HE LEFT OFF . WHATEVER ATTACKED ME WASN 'T A PERSON . WELL , DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT ? MULDER , MAYBE YOU 'VE JUST SEEN WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE . WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT ? I DIDN 'T IMAGINE IT , SCULLY . LISTEN TO YOURSELF , MULDER . LISTEN TO WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING . YOU 'RE STARTING TO SOUND LIKE M- - [ Sighs ] LOOK , WHEN I COULDN 'T REACH YOU , I WENT TO YOUR APARTMENT . I SAW YOUR NEW WALLPAPER . DON 'T YOU REALIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE , MULDER ? HE IS TESTING YOU . HEIS THE REASON YOU WERE BROUGHT ON THIS CASE IN THE FIRST PLACE . PATTERSON ? [ Sighs ] HE REQUESTED YOUR INVOLVEMENT THROUGH SKINNER 'S OFFICE . I CHECKED THAT 302 MYSELF . MULDER , WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? [ Engine Starts ] [ Police Radio Chatter ] SO , HOW 'S MULDER HOLDING UP ? SIR , CAN I HAVE A MINUTE ? OF COURSE . IN PRIVATE . WHAT 'S THIS ABOUT ? MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME . I 'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU 'RE DOING CONCERNING AGENT MULDER . I 'M AFRAID I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE REFERRING TO . I THINK YOU DO , SIR . I THINK YOU KNEW EXACTLY HOW AGENT MULDER WOULD RESPOND WHEN YOU BROUGHT HIM ON THIS CASE . YOU DID REQUEST HIM , DIDN 'T YOU ? IF YOU 'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AGENT MULDER 'S CONDUCT OR BEHAVIOR , MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT UP WITH HIM . - YOU KNOW I ALREADY HAVE . - THEN WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO ? I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST WITH ME ABOUT WHAT YOU 'RE TRYING TO DO . IS THIS SOME KIND OF PAYBACK FOR WHAT HAPPENED EIGHT YEARS AGO , BECAUSE MULDER QUIT THE I.S.U. ? - MY MOTIVATIONS AREN 'T THAT PETTY . - THEN WHY ? I ASKED FOR MULDER BECAUSE ... I WANNA CLOSE THE BOOK ON THIS GODFORSAKEN CASE ONCE AND FOR ALL . AND YOU KNEW THAT HE COULD HELP YOU SOLVE IT . MY ADVICE TO YOU , SCULLY : LET MULDER DO WHAT HE HAS TO DO . DON 'T GET IN HIS WAY AND DON 'T TRY TO HOLD HIM BACK ... BECAUSE YOU WON 'T BE ABLE TO . [ Police Radio Chatter Continues ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Opens And Shuts Glove Box ] [ Door Buzzes ] [ Men Muttering ] WHY DIDN 'T IT KILL ME LIKE IT KILLED THE OTHERS ? WHY DID IT LET ME LIVE ? EVEN IF I COULD TELL YOU WHY , YOU WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND . THEN HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND , JOHN . PLEASE . GO AWAY . NO . YOU HAVE TO HELP ME GO DEEPER , HELP ME GET INSIDE ITS HEAD ... LIKE IT GOT INSIDE YOURS , SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WANTS . IT WANTS WHAT IT WANTS . TO KILL INNOCENT YOUNG MEN BY CARVING UP THEIR FACES ? YOU HAVE FELT ITS HUNGER , FELT YOUR BONES RATTLED BY ITS FROZEN BREATH . SO YOU KNOW ... NOTHING CAN BE DONE . UNLESS I FIND IT . THEN WHAT WILL YOU DO ? JUST TELL ME HOW TO FIND IT , JOHN . NO . JUST TELL ME HOW TO FIND THIS THING . YOU CAN 'T FIND IT . [ Grunts ] [ Breathing Heavily ] ONLY IT CAN FIND YOU . MAYBE ... IT ALREADY HAS . FIRST TIME UP , I STRUCK OUT .

 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi ( therapist ) Keep going . That 's the way . Don 't stop now . Oh , come on , keep pushing . No pain , no gain . Five more steps and then you 're done . Five ... Four ... Three ... Good . - And ... super . - Hit it . Nice and easy . You 're coming along , Bobby . - I 'm pleased with your improvement . - Back off . Keep your fingers on your pepper spray , just like I told ya . - Mr Piero , is all this necessary ? - Yes , ma 'am _ I 'd say it is . So what 's this guy 's story ? Cop killer . Regular people killer . General , all-around waste of skin . So what are you scared of ? Guy 's a vegetable . What 's he gonna do ? Run over you with his big plastic wheel ? I 'll tell you what . You wanna last here more than a week , you don 't ever underestimate this man . Never trust him and never let your guard down around him . Never . Capisce ? Comprendo . ( door buzzer ) What 's up , Modell ? ( whispering ) ( pounding ) Hey , Chuck ? What the hell happened , Chuck ? Where 's Modell ? He had to go . - ( door buzzeU - The orderly 's being questioned . Judging by his mental state , he 's not gonna be much help . So there 's very little we know for sure at this point . What we do know is that the last confirmed bed check was 2 _ O4am _ As of 6 _ 14am , the subject was reported escaped . Since then there have been no further sightings or contact . How did he make his way out of the building ? Every indication is he simply walked out the door . Due to the unique nature of this investigation , the FBI will head the manhunt . The Marshals Service will lend their expertise and will coordinate their efforts with myself or my designated SACS , Agents Mulder and Scully . They apprehended the subject the first time around . Agent Mulder ? The subject 's name is Robert Patrick Modell _ He 's a serial killer responsible for at least 17 murders . Specifically , he targets law enforcement . In 1996 , he caused the death of an FBI agent and a Loudoun County Sheriff 's deputy . It was all a game to him . He was looking for , in his words , " a worthy adversary " . To win makes him feel important . He likes to think of himself as a ronin , a warrior without a master , adhering to the Budo , the Japanese way of war . In truth , he 's a highly intelligent sociopath who has no fear of dying . In keeping with his game archetype , he likes to leave clues . We expect to be contacted by him hopefully sooner rather than later . We fully expect him to pick up exactly where he left off . What do you mean , he just walked out the building ? Modell refers to himself as " Pusher " _ Technically speaking , his victims ' wounds were self-inflicted . He has a unique ability to force his will upon others , to push his victims into hurting or killing themselves . Say what ? This is all you need to know : Do not trust this man . Do not talk to him . Do not engage him in conversation , even if he is unarmed . Approach him with extraordinary caution , - and then only with adequate backup . - What 's " adequate backup " ? Adequate backup ? Every cop you can lay your hands on . Line up for your assignments . - What 's Moclell 's condition ? - Extremely weakened . - The doctors say he can barely even walk . - Oh , yeah ? Mulder , I 'm amazed he 's even alive . The condition we last saw him in - comatose , a bullet in the head . - How did he recover ? - Apparently , about six months ago he simply woke up . It 's unusual but it 's not unheard of . - And his brain tumour that was killing him ? - It still is . - Is there anybody on staff we can talk to ? - He has a physical therapist . Mulder ... What if Modell plans to pick up where he left off ? Where does that leave you ? You were his prime target . - Should you be heading this investigation ? - As opposed to what ? What 's your point ? That it 's exactly what he wants . That once again , you 're playing his game . The escaped inmate , Robert Patrick Modell , was convicted in 1996 of charges stemming from an incident in which he brandished a Hrearm in a hospital . Two people died . OfHcials are cautioning residents not to approach this man . He is considered to be extremely dangerous . Paul ? Can I help you ? Hi . You 're not scared of snakes ? Huh ? Looks like a timber rattler _ ( hisses ) Hold on tight to the neck now . Don 't let it bite you . Don 't drop it . If you drop it ... it 'll get ya . Todd ? Do you think I could get some service now ? - Yeah . - Go into the back and put the snake down . - He 's not yet considered a suspect . - We 'll run that videotape again . This was the scene at Lorton Penitentiary less than one hour ago . Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , along with the US Marshals Service and representatives of local law-enforcement , assembled a multi-agency task fo ... He couldn 't have been faking it completely . The gunshot wound did a hell of a lot of damage . You 're the officer that shot him . It says here that Modell had a visitor yesterday afternoon . - Who ? - it 's marked " LSC " . Little Sisters of Charity . They try to visit hospitalised inmates . Did Modell get any other visitors besides the Little Sisters of Charity ? Not that I know of . He didn 't have much in the way of family . He was raised in foster homes mostly . Sounds like you got to know him well . He never gave me any grief . He worked hard at getting better . I talked to him sometimes . - About what ? - Small talk . Nothing important . - He 'd ask how I was . - He 's a very considerate man . I don 't doubt for a second Robert Modell belongs in prison , but I had never had any problem with him personally . Agents , it 's Modell _ He 's asking for you . We 're running a trace right now . We just need 30 seconds . - Yeah ? - Two words : it 's alive . ( Modell laughs ) - I don 't feel like playing your game , IVlodell . - Touchy . Look , Mulden - there 's something I need you to hear - Tell me in person , Modell _ No . Seriously listen to me . No , you listen . Either come back here on your own , or I drag your sorry ass back on the bumper of my car . - Time ? - Ten more seconds . - When did you turn into Clint Eastwood ? - Don 't let him rope you in . Stop talking like a tough guy and pay attention . - I know you 're tracing this call . I don 't care . - Mulder , hang up the phone . Mulder ; are you going to listen-- - We got it . Let 's go ! ( ofHceU Watch yourselves ! ( ofHceo Move back ! - There 's nothing back there . - How far could he get ? Outside ! ( car horn ) - Where is he ? Where 's Modell ? - He had to go . ( door opens and shuts ) I 'm gonna take a wild stab here and guess this is a clue . It appears as if he died from ingesting paint . I imagine that he did all of this and then drank what was left . See what you can make of it . Modell ? - Cerulean blue . - What 's the point of all this ? Maybe his victim . This is Nathan Bowman , with the Loudoun County Attorney 's Office . He 's the prosecutor that tried Modell in 1996 . - So you think it 's simple revenge ? - Sir ? it 's not a manifesto . It 's the same single ideogram over and over . Which is What ? The hand it 's in is sloppy , but I think it 's supposed to be " kitsunegari " _ Fox hunt . - Fox IVlulder . - Thats a little on the nose , don 't you think ? Was Nathan Bowman married ? Yep . What are you thinking ? Linda . Bet that 's his wife , huh ? ( ringing tone ) - ( woman ) Nova Max Realty . - Hi , Linda ? I 'm sorry . Mrs Bowman 's meeting a client . May I take a message ? Do you know the name of the client Mrs Bowman went to see ? Lt 's-- - Mr Fox Mu / den - It 's him . - Location . Find where he is . Do you know where Mrs Bowman went to meet Fox Mulder ? A location ? A commercial property in Falls Church . - Um , can you hold on , please ? - Yeah . Give me the Falls Church PD . Unit six at 214 Channel Avenue . Signs of forced entry . We 're gonna check it out . ( dispatcher ) Exercise extreme caution , six - Backup is en route - ( Modell ) Hello ? Officer ? I 'm over here . Keep on comin ' _ That 's right . No , not that way . Not that way , either . You 're getting warmer . Dead ahead . Straight in front of you . Buddy , I 'm straight in front of you . What do you want me to do ? Draw you a map ? Keep comin ' _ Almost there . Put it down ! Put the gun down ! Put it down , now ! On the floor ! Face down ! Do it ! Marty , I got him ! Up here ! ( ofHceU Let 's go ! Move ! Federal Agents ! Officer , where are you ? ! ( ofHceU Upstairs ! Sir , I got him ! - I got him ! - He 's gone crazy ! Get him away from me ! Give me your gun . - He was here . He came for the woman . - Why Bowman 's wife ? - What would he want with her ? - ( ofHceU Hey , we got a visitor ! Linda Bowman ? - I 'm Fox IVlulder . - Hi . Uh ... You 're my 12.15 ? The appointment was made this morning through my secretary . All I Know is I was supposed to meet a Mr Mulder here . He didn 't leave a number , and I couldn 't call him to tell him that I was running late . Why would someone do this to Nathan ? Mrs Bowman , did your husband ever discuss his work as a prosecutor with you ? Sometimes . Did he ever mention the name Robert Patrick Modell ? " Pusher " ? That was Nathan 's biggest case . Why ? Can you think of any reason why this man Modell would take an interest in you ? What do you mean ? We believe he murdered your husband . It also appears that he made the appointment to see you today . No . - No , he 's in prison . - Not since six o 'clock this morning . Oh , God . You 're safe with us , Mrs Bowman . If you 'll come with me , we 'll place you in protective custody . Find him . Yes , sir . - Mulder ? - Why didn 't Modell just kill those two cops ? - What was to stop him ? - Hopefully he wasn 't capable . - As in too tired ? - We 've seen that before with him . Maybe . I don 't know . Something 's just not making sense . - Can I borrow your radio ? - Yes , sir . ( man speaking Spanish on TV ) Gracias , amigo - - What took you so long ? - Scully , I got him . Come quick . - ( Scully ) Where are you ? - Hold on . North side of Channel , second floor . Some engineering company . - We need to talk . - Shut up , IVIodell ! - Mulder , listen to me . - I said shut up ! - There 's something I need ... - Shut up or I will shoot you ! - Mulder ... - I will shoot you ! Shut up ! You 're going to listen to me . You 're going to listen to me , Mulder . I will shoot you . Listen . Mulder . - Mulder , what happened ? Where 's IVIodell ? - He had to go . About ten minutes ago . He can 't have gotten far . - Anything ? - No sign . Yes , Agent Mulder 's fine . Yes , sir . - How are you feeling ? - Aside from the utter grinding humiliation that comes from knowing I let our suspect go ... pretty good . It could have happened to anyone , Mulder . No , actually it couldn 't have . I didn 't find Modell . He sought me out . - He wanted me to hear his message . - Which was what ? - " Don 't play the game . " - Whose game ? His ? I don 't think so . I 'm not even sure he 's playing a game . Of course he is . You said yourself that he was gonna pick up where he left off . Why didn 't he kill the cops or the prison guard ? Hell , why didn 't he kill me ? Why didn 't he make me eat a bullet out of my own gun ? He could have . - He killed Nathan Bowman . - He was there , but it doesn 't prove he did it . This man 's affected you , influenced your thinking . - It 's not like that . - A man is made to drink a gallon of paint ? Kitsunegari : fox hunt . You 're saying that 's not Modell ? Modell is involved . He 's related to it somehow , but not the way you think . - That 's your opinion . - Yeah . That 's my opinion . How can you be sure it 's your own ? What do we still agree on here ? That Modell was pursuing Linda Bowman ? I 'd like ' LO know Why . I 'm sorry . I don 't know if I can tell you much more than I already have . We appreciate your help . I know Nathan was very proud of having prosecuted the case . He said this man , Modell , was extremely clever and dangerous and that he was a menace to society . Nathan mentioned that an FBI agent had ultimately shot him . - Was that you ? - Yes . He said you crippled him and put him in a wheelchair . Nathan said it was too bad that you just didn 't kill him . It would have saved the taxpayers the cost of a trial . Your husband talked with you a lot about it . Well , as I said , he was proud . I guess he felt that it was his brush with greatness . Is it possible that he mentioned you to Robert IVIodell ? No , I sincerely doubt it . - We were only married two months . - How long did you know him ? It was two months and two days . Why wait when it 's true love ? - You never know how long you have . - No , you don 't . It 's not like Nathan was impulsive or flighty . I don 't wanna paint him as that . He was true blue . Thank you . - She killed Nathan Bowman . - What ? Modell was there for another reason . She killed her husband . - Mulder ... - Just hear me out . His " brush with greatness " . She won 't " paint him " as impulsive . Who talks like that ? - You tell me . - She was waving it under our noses . Modell warned me not to play the game . I think it was her game he was talking about . Modell told you ? Has she asked how her husband was murdered ? Is she interested in the details ? An escaped serial killer is supposedly stalking her . Does she seem fearful to you ? The woman 's in shock , Agent Mulder . She 's not herself . I might add , neither are you . - You heard her in there , Scully . - IVlulder , no . I 'm sorry . You said it yourself : don 't listen to Modell , don 't trust him . But you 've done both . But what if she can do what Modell does ? - I think you should go home . - You think I should go home ? You 're suspended until such time I 'm confident yourjudgment is sound . - Give me your weapon . - Who are you afraid I 'm gonna point it at ? Mulder , I think you should do what he says . Excuse me . Would it be possible to get something to drink ? Water ? I 'll have somebody come right in . I 'll prove it . - Agent Mulder ? - Go fetch her some water . I don 't know the man that well . I 'm sorry you got the impression I do . Anything at all that you might recall ? Did he ever talk about his past ? - Mention anybody special ? A woman ? - No . Anything remarkable he ever said that you can remember ? One time someone else said something about him that struck me as unusual . What was that ? It was one of the nuns who visits from Little Sisters of Charity . She once referred to him as a " conquered warrior " . That was kind of weird . The same nun who visited the day before he escaped ? - Yeah , the one that always visits . - How many times has she visited ? - Maybe three , four . - Will you take a look at something ? Is that the woman ? Is that the nun ? ( phone ringing ) Hang on . I 'm blind as a bat . - Therapy room . - Here . Glasses ? Uh-huh . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . - it 's empty . - Where 'd you leave ' em ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . OK . Oh , yeah , he 's here . No ! I need help in here ! Help ! Hey , you got him ? - Go home . - What ? Go home . ( door opens ) ( cellphone rings ) - Scully . - Hey , Scully . It 's me . - Where are you ? - I 'm at the prison . You were told to lay off . It 's too late for that . Modell 's therapist electrocuted herself in front of me . - She was on the phone when she did it . - It was Modell _ - It was Linda Bowman . - Mulder ! The therapist would 've verified that Linda visited Modell in prison . Would have ? You don 't know that . Just trace the call and cut off any access that woman has to a phone . - I 'm heading back there right now . - I 'm not at the safe house . - You 're not ? - We 're investigating a suicide . Why isn 't anybody picking up at the safe house switchboard ? Back in the trucks . ( phone ringing ) On the floor , IVIodell ! - Hey , it 's Mel Cooley . - On your face . Do it now ! - I said now . - I have a gun . - How 's his vitals ? - ( nurse ) 175 over 90 . - Did he try to speak to you ? - He said we got our man . - What happened ? - You were told to go home , Agent Mulder . What happened ? - He had a gun , I saw it clearly . A revolver . - He pointed it at you ? We haven 't found the gun yet . He said to you that he had a gun . Yes . And he did . Excuse me . Modell was unarmed . He purposely drew Skinner 's fire . - For what possible reason ? - To protect someone . - Linda Bowman . - To take the fall for her . That 's one hell of a plan . The serial killer makes us believe he 's guilty , in turn diverting the suspicion away from the real-estate lady ? Well , he had me going . - Where is she ? - They 've taken her home . There is no reason to keep her in protective custody . It is over . - No , it 's not . - Where are you going ? If he survives , I wanna be the first person he talks to . - Talking to him has done you enough harm . - OK , you do me a favour . Give me a call when you think I 've come to my senses , all right ? Sir , I 'm going to need to change the patient 's bandages . Call me if he wakes up , please . Yes , sir . Bobby ? Why did you do it ? I didn 't ask you to come after me . Don 't _ .. don 't make a mistake . I 'm not . After what they 've done , do you think I 'd let them get away with this ? I 'm gonna finish what you started . No . Stop now . Stop ... n ... ( wheezing ) Bobby . Bobby ... you 're not in any pain . You feel wonderful . You 've never felt better . Your heart is slowing . It 's tired . It 's too worn out to keep beating . Let it rest . ( heart monitor beeps ) It slows . It slows . It stops . Hello ? Yes , I have that information for you . He was released yesterday . I got the Iidocaine , Doctor . Never mind . Put him down as 7.38 . Yes , Doctor . I 'm sorry . ( Scully ) Mulder ? - Scully , what are you doing here ? - You were right about him , Mulder . Scully . She 's making me do this . - Where is she ? - She 's here . Mulder , make her stop . I can 't help myself . - Linda Bowman ! - Mulder , make her stop . - Show yourself ! - Mulder ! No ! No ! ( gunshot ) ( footsteps approach ) I 'm gonna kill you . - Don 't listen to her , Mulder . - What ? ! It 's me . You were right about her . Linda Bowman is pushing you . - What the hell are you talking about ? - I 'm Scully . Linda 's right behind you . She 's telling you I 'm her . - You killed her ! - Mulder , I 'm Scully . I 'm not dead . She wants you to shoot me . She knows you 'll never forgive yourself . - Shut up ! - Listen to me ! Your mother is Tina ! Your sister is Samantha ! - Shut up ! - Modell warned you . Don 't play her game . Mulder ? You think you can hold me . ( cellphone dials ) Yes . We 'd like an ambulance to 214 Channel Avenue . Linda Bowman . She has an advanced temporal-lobe tumour , just like Modell 's . It seems to run in the family . She and Modell are related ? - Fraternal twins . - He meant to protect his sister . Apparently , she only found out about his existence six months ago . They were separated when they were two weeks old , raised apart . Her " fox hunt " ... I 'm guessing that she wanted revenge for what she feels we did to her brother . Anything you wanna add to that ? I think that covers it . Mulder , a moment , please . I just want to say you did a good job . How 's that ? Nobody could 've figured this out but you . You knew it was Linda Bowman , not IVlodell . - You were way ahead of me . - I almost killed my partner . Mulder , despite that , you prevailed . You won her game . Then how come I feel like I lost ?

 Were you born in a barn ? Isn 't that just like you migrants ? Always stinking up our country . Here . Take it . Please . I 've got a family . Really ? Well , that changes things . We 'll have to visit them next . You bastard ! Somebody , help me ! What 's wrong with you people ? Everybody okay ? How long do we have here ? 36 hours . That 's a piece of cake . Place seems friendly enough . I could sure use a good meal . How are we fixed for cash , Q-Ball ? A little light . Yeah , well , we 've been there before . Let 's check out the local music scene . Maybe I can pick up a quick gig . Not a single RB club listed . Well , we 've been to a lot of worlds where people had no taste in music . Hey , migrant ! Hey ! Migrant ! You 're coming with us . Hey ! Hey , Rembrandt ! Somebody call the cops ! Remmy ! Hey , what the ... Get in ! You can 't drive . Just like my steam-powered buggy back home . Hold on ! Go . That way ! What are you doing ? All right , guys , I think you got the wrong man , so why don 't you just pull over ? We 'll call this an honest mistake . We got the right man , all right . Get out of the way . Yo ! Sanitation , you better move your truck ! Hey , sanitation ! Get a move on ! What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? This is weird . Don 't touch it ! It 's warm . Is it human ? I don 't know . Hey , man , can you understand me ? Maybe some kind of genetically-engineered worker . I don 't know . Well , whatever it is , we have to think about it later . Remmy . They 're long gone by now . Well , we have to get back to the Chandler , because if he gets loose , he 'll expect us to be there . We 've got to keep searching . We 're not gonna get very far in a stolen delivery truck . We can 't just leave him . All right . We are not gonna be much help to Remmy if we get busted for grand theft auto . Right . Don 't worry . We 're not going anywhere without Remmy . Let 's get out of here . Nice talking to you . You boys have had a busy week . Welcome to the condos . Who the devil are you people ? Shut up ! Easy , Ralph . If you bruise him , you don 't get your bounty . All right . You know the drill . Fill in the yellow areas , and they pay you at the gate . Now , you look , I haven 't done anything ! Well , that 's part of the problem , isn 't it ? Don 't you worry , migrant . We 're gonna make you very productive . Make our guest comfortable . Welcome to the condos , boy . I 'm getting tired of hearing that . And I don 't like being called boy . No insult intended , son . Anybody south of 50 seems like a kid to me . I 'm Harold . I 'm Rembrandt . What is this place ? Where the hell you been ? Don 't ask . I 'm too beat to think of something . And you would never believe the truth . You 're part of Governor Schick 's economic recovery plan . Economic recovery ? I was dragged off the street by a bunch of thugs . Economic recovery facilitators . That 's what we like to call them . They just call themselves Stompers . Yeah . Yeah . That 's what I 'd call them . Ever since Prop 286 passed , they 've been kicking ass and taking names . Prop 286 ? You are out of it . Racial repatriation act . We just call it the round-up . Schick 's preserving American jobs for American workers . You mean white workers ? I 'm not here because of my great tan . This Schick sounds like a regular Hitler . Who ? Adolph Hitler . World War Two ? I didn 't see the film . Real life 's sci-fi enough for me . So what do they do with us now ? Deported , if we 're lucky . I 'm an American citizen . So ? I was born in Pasadena . Great . Freaking great . We 'll check the Chandler . We 'll leave a message for Remmy . And we 'll plan our moves from there , okay ? We should go to the police . Not a good idea . What kind of place is this ? I mean , why would they take Rembrandt and not us ? You were lucky , Colin . You were raised on a world where race didn 't make a difference . Unfortunately , that 's the exception , not the rule . America for Americans . America for Americans . Vote Schick for president . America for Americans . Vote Schick for president . We 're not from this district . That 's okay . I can give you your purity test and register you right here . Just take a sec . Ah , we vote absentee . Thanks . Pardon me . It 's okay . It 's just an Eddie . He doesn 't feel anything . Thank you . Come hear Governor Schick for yourself . There 's a big rally tomorrow at city square . America for Americans . Welcome to the Chandler Hotel . Hi . We 're supposed to meet a friend of ours here . Could you tell us if he checked in ? Certainly , sir . What 's his name ? Brown . Rembrandt Brown . Hmm . No one under that name . Did he leave a message ? Maybe you 've seen him . He 's about six feet tall . Dark hair . Brown shirt . He 's a black man . You 're not from around here , are you ? We 're just passing through . Then you better just keep moving . I 'm sorry . It 's just that ... Things have gotten worse around here since Schick decided to run for President . I hope you find your friend . But when you do , you better just get out of the state . We plan to . Thanks for the advice . So , how are your Eddies working out ? Zero cost labor . Without the Eddie program , this hotel couldn 't stay open . It 's great . The government drops them off in the morning and then picks them up in the afternoon . I don 't have to worry about a thing . What about the people whose jobs they 've taken ? You think I like letting my staff go ? But we 're all trying to dig out of the recession here . Now , do you want a room or not ? Kirk . What ? Where have you been ? The linens on the second floor need to be changed . Well , have the Eddies do it . That 's what they 're for . Kirk , what 's gotten into you ? Pride . You 're just not used to seeing it . Hey , mama 's boy . Are you with us ? Or you doing migrant 's work ? I don 't want you hanging out with them . We 're celebrating . Ralph just made another delivery to the condos today . He wants me on the next round-up ! You promised me you would have nothing to do with that place . Wake up , Mom ! We 're already a part of it . He 's just in that rebellious stage . Yeah . Kids . It 's almost suppertime . If they remember today . We 've gotta get out of here . And go where ? Even if you could get past the guards , the Stompers 'd pick you up again as soon as you hit the streets . I 've got some friends on the outside who can help us . You just don 't get it , do you ? You 're not outside . So what are you gonna do , huh ? Just gonna let them deport you ? Look . You 're an American , too , man . No . This isn 't my America . Not anymore . I 'll just go where they send me and try to start over . Leave this country to Schick and the rest of them . They deserve it . On your feet , migrants . Numbers 1201 to 1220 , let 's go . It 's time to move out . Deport time . Come on ! No . They didn 't call your number . Sit around here if you want to . I 'm busting a move . You 'll never make it . Move it ! Leaving us so soon ? Now , I 'm hurt , migrant . But if you don 't want to be here and you 're not happy , you don 't have to stay . Process him . He don 't look like he 's in any shape to be shipped out , Mr. Beck . Get back inside , Harold , unless you want to join him . No . I 'm just saying that I 'm a man short on my work detail . We could use another hand . You wouldn 't want to come up short on this week 's collection , would you ? Hold up . Take him . Let 's get these migrants processed . Move it ! Now , why didn 't I think of that ? Take on a whole bunch of guys with machine guns with a piece of angle iron . At least I didn 't just stand there and watch . Who do you think you are , boy ? I 've been in here a few more years than you have . Now , I didn 't get this far by acting like a damn fool . No , just by burying your head in the sand . You don 't know anything . Now , I marched at Selma . I sat at the lunch counters , I had the dogs turned on me , the fire hoses , the tear gas . Now , don 't tell me about sticking my head in the sand . Well , excuse me , sir ! I didn 't know that . Yeah , well , there 's a lot you don 't know . I 'm all for standing up for what you believe in , but I 'm not ready to become a martyr . I tried to do something once , and I got the scars to back me up . See ? Look at all the good it did us . So you just give up ? Look . Times change . Politics change . Now , we keep our heads down ... This 'll all blow over eventually . You really believe that ? Can 't you see where this is headed ? They start out by deporting you , then what ? You 've seen how beat-up these people are when they come in here . What about the ones who don 't even make it this far ? The ones that are left in dumpsters ? Left over in bean fields with their heads cracked open ? No . Nothing ... Nothing blows over . Let 's get you cleaned up . For spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountains majesties Above the fruited plain ! America ! America ! God shed his grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea ! Yeah ! Governor Schick ! Governor Schick ! America for Americans ! Yeah ! America for Americans ! Kirk here tells me that you guys made another delivery today . Very good work . Little man 's got a big mouth . Aw , come on . You can 't blame him . He 's proud of the work you 're doing . We all are . Ralph 's sent more migrants to the condos than anyone else . He even got a letter from Governor Schick . We don 't want to bore this man with our stories , Kirk . I don 't think it 's boring at all . I hear they 're running quite an operation over at the condos . I 'd love to check it out sometime . So you 're a real Schick supporter , huh ? All the way to the White House . Hey , you got your party card ? I wish . I keep calling the campaign office and they tell me it 's in the mail . Which office ? Uh-oh . Get ready . Get ready for what ? Hey , Kirk , do you know this guy ? No . He 's been hanging around here all afternoon . What are you ? A.C.L. U ? No . Huh ? You a damn reporter ? No . I 'm not . What are you , damn east coast liberal media ? Oh . Take it outside ! Come on . Hold him down ! Kirk ! Stop it ! Stop ! Mom ! Let 's go ! Mom . I 'm sorry . Mom . Easy , easy . She 's probably got a concussion . Get away ! This is your fault ! We have to get her to a doctor . No . No doctors . Would you leave her alone ? Look , man , she has to go to the hospital . He 's right . Come on . It 's a fairly serious concussion . We 'll have to monitor her closely . But she 's gonna be okay ? Yes . I think so . Her M.R.I. looks good . We 're just waiting on some blood work . Oh , God . No ! Mom . Mom , it 's okay . You 're in the hospital . You took my blood ? Nurse ! Mom , it 's all right ! You didn 't have any right . Nobody 's gonna hurt you . Nobody 's gonna hurt you . You don 't understand . Oh , Kirk . I am sorry . I should have told you . Told me what ? Mom ? Mom ? Well , this explains her agitation . Call the R.P.s. What 's going on ? This is your mother 's blood work . Standard DNA test revealed some racial impurities . Well , that 's impossible . We 're required to notify the racial police . I 'm going to have to ask you to wait here . There 's been a mistake . Run the test again . There is no mistake . She is not a migrant , and neither am I ! Is your mother all right ? Kirk . Stay away from me ! What 's going on ? They ran some kind of DNA test on his mother 's blood . They say she 's not racially pure . It 's a lie ! Kirk , Kirk . Kirk . We 've gotta get out of here . Then go . You know , I 'm not afraid . I know who I am . I don 't care what their tests say . How many people have you rounded up who said the same thing ? " It 's a lie . I 'm not a migrant . " Did you listen to them then ? Will they listen to you now ? Uh , Quinn ? Let 's go . Stop ! Police ! Halt ! There ! Move over ! I 'm driving ! Maggie , go ! Go ! What is this ? This is where we work . R.P.S like busy hands . You empty the pockets and put them into the bin and dump the clothes over there . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Whose stuff is this ? You don 't think they gonna process you out of here with a C note and a new suit of clothes , do you ? They take these to defray our " cost to society . " How could you do this ? It 's the law . They took a vote . Did you get to vote ? How could you do this ? You fought it before . You just gonna stand by and let Schick stir up a bunch of angry punks with this racist bull ? So what choice do I have ? What choice did you have when they turned the fire hoses on you in Selma ? You chose to stand there and take it ! Harold . There are some things that are so , so evil , you can 't believe that a human being is capable of doing them . So , you just pretend that it isn 't happening . Harold . It is happening , Harold . And it will continue to happen until you open your eyes and you do something about it . This makes me sick . Barracks . Barracks . Processing . Get her to processing before she dies on us . Barracks . Move it . Barracks . Processing . Processing . Barracks . Back off ! Processing . Barracks . Processing . Kirk . We need your help . My help ? Thanks to you , the R.P. S are trying to hunt me down like a mongrel . So , gee , if there 's anything I can do for you , just ask . What about your mother , huh ? You just gonna write her off ? Walk away ? She 'll get what she deserves . What she deserves ? What she deserves ? She saw the writing on the wall and tried to protect you . What does she deserve for that ? She lied to me . Yeah . She did . But you 've still got the same blood you had in you this morning , pure or not . You 're still the same person . Unfortunately . Come on . Let 's get out of here . Look . I used to ask her about our family . My father , my grandparents . She said she never kept any pictures of them . Now I know why . Kirk . If you help us , we can save your mother and our friend . Where 'd they take her , Kirk ? To the condos ? Yeah . Probably . Can you take us there ? Please . What do you want ? Stay where you are . You Beck ? Yeah . Who the hell are you ? Ralph sent me . We picked up a couple of A.C.L.U. Spies . They wanted to get a look at the condos . Ralph said Beck 'd be happy to give them a tour . Yeah ? Where 's Ralph ? Why didn 't he come himself ? Busy night , you know . A lot of migrants on the streets . Fascists ! Why don 't you read the Bill of Rights ? You can 't get away with this . Shut up in there ! He 's got a mouth on him . We 'll be glad to show them around . Now , let 's get these card-carrying liberals to processing . Come on ! America for Americans . No . Please . Don 't do this ! Please ! It was all a mistake . Come on . Get up ! Don 't give them the satisfaction ! But I 'm not a spy . I 'll do anything ! Please ! I don 't belong here . It was a big mistake ! I 'm not a spy ! Really , I 'll do anything ! Maggie . Hey , come on . Sounds like our ride just showed up . What ? My friends are here . Let 's move . Are you crazy ? They 'll shoot us . Look , sooner or later I am leaving here . Now , are you with me ? I don 't ! Please ! No , I don 't . Hey , hey , hey , bro . Hey . Hey . Hey , bro . Stop ! Enough ! Come on . You got him ! Come on ! Hey . Over here ! Only you guys make that much noise during a rescue . Rembrandt ! You okay ? Yeah . I am now . Look , unlock the door . Down that way . And keep it down . I hope you have a plan to get him out of there . Oh , you know me . Well , that 's what I 'm afraid of . Remmy ! Maybe I should have sent out a memo that you guys were coming . Come on . Let 's go . We 're here to find my mother . She would have come in today . She was injured . Her head was bandaged . Yeah . Yeah , I saw her . Well , where is she ? I 'll show you . I know they brought her here somewhere . What is this place ? Processing center . Supposed to be where they ship the people off to another country . This is a lab . Come on , people . Let 's snap it up . There she is ! Mom . Oh , my God ! They 're not deporting the migrants . They 're turning them into these . Turning them into what ? Eddies . Synthetic workers . Or at least we thought they were synthetic . Zero cost labor . Hey , Vanessa . Can you hear me ? Oh . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Come on . We 've gotta go . Let 's grab her . Come on . Move it ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on ! Come on ! Open the gate . Damn it . Stand back ! Come on ! I 'll drive . I 'm out ! Yeah ! Me , too ! Ralph needs to pick his friends more carefully . Do people know what you 're doing out here ? When unemployment drops to five percent , will they even care ? Get out of here ! Go , boy ! Come on , Remmy ! Down here ! No ! Harold ! Hang on ! She was so beautiful . Look what they did to my mother . Well , whatever they did , they didn 't finish . Maybe there 's a way we can reverse the process . Our lives are over . It 's like she 's been branded by them now . Kirk . We can take you to a place where no one will know that . You people just don 't get it . Schick is going to be president . There 's going to be a big rally tonight . He 's going to take over the country . Maybe not . Now , a good man died getting her out of that camp . I 'm willing to bet there 's a lot of others out there like him that are willing to fight Schick . You think those migrants are gonna be able to stop him ? They 're the reason why he 's so popular in the first place . Look . There is only one way to stop him . Kirk ! Kirk , open up ! We just wanna talk to you . Kirk ! There he goes . Kirk ! He 's got a gun . This guy 's gonna end up killing millions . So , we should let Kirk assassinate him ? They always say if you could go back in time and kill Hitler , would you ? Well , would you ? This isn 't an ethics exam . We 're talking about the kid 's life . Schick will have a professional security force . They 'll take Kirk down before he gets within 50 feet of him . 50 feet is close enough . I know . I hate to sacrifice that kid . I just hate to see this world like this . Look , the problem with madmen is that there 's always somebody waiting in the wings to take their place . They never had their Hitler on this world . What if the only way they can learn is by experience ? That 's a pretty harsh lesson . Maybe we can expose the guy for who he really is . Let the country decide for themselves . In one hour ? I said " maybe . " Here . Hold this . Come on . Attention Schick supporters ! The Governor would like to thank you all for attending this America for Americans rally ! So , everybody , just please be patient , and I know he 'll be here any minute ! Hey , Ralph . Kirk . We didn 't think you were gonna make it . Well , wouldn 't miss a chance to see Governor Schick up close . Yeah . Well , uh ... How 's your mom doing ? Oh , she 's fine . It 's just a bump on the head . No problem . Great . Welcome back . Excuse me , sir . Could you get me up front to see the Governor ? I 'm dying to see him up close . Colin and I 'll go look for Kirk . You watch yourself . It 's not a friendly crowd out there . Okay , all you Schick supporters ! The Governor would like to thank you for attending his America for Americans rally today . I 'm told he 's on his way . If you 'll just be patient , he 'll be here any minute . Two minutes to air . What the hell is this ? Take it easy , guys . There 's been a little change in program . Quinn ! Quinn ! Colin ? He 's over there ! Kirk . Listen to me . You 're not gonna stop me ! Schick deserves to die . But we can 't act like him . Shooting him will only make us part of the disease he spreads . Think about your mother . How is it going to help her if you do this ? Okay , Kirk ? Give me the gun . Kirk ! Hey . I thought we got rid of you , huh ? Schick ! Schick ! Schick ! America for Americans ! Schick ! Schick ! Schick ! Remmy . Five minutes ! Ready . Good afternoon , my fellow Americans . Schick ! Schick ! Schick ! Do it . Now . I know that I 'm not the man that you expected to see tonight . A migrant . Who the hell ? Someone who you don 't consider to be a real American , even though I was born in this country just like you . There 's a woman that I want all of America to see . Another migrant . What 's going on ? Her name is Vanessa . She was taken to one of Governor Schick 's relocation camps . The camps that you approved under Prop 286 . What ? In a few hours , processing would 've been complete . Vanessa would have been part of Schick 's unpaid labor force . Part of his plan for economic recovery . Cut him off ! Now ! The Eddies are not synthetic . They 're human beings like Vanessa was once . People who have been mutilated by Schick 's butchers . Schick must be stopped . " It 's a lie . " A migrant lie ! That 's what they 're up to ! They 're trying to fool you ! These people will stop at nothing ! Don 't let them do this ! Take it ! Take it ! Don 't let these people take it from you ! It 's ours ! Ours ! How did I do ? Very nice . Now let 's get out of here . Cops are coming . We now return to our regularly scheduled program . Don 't pay any attention to what they 're saying ! Glad you could join us . How much time ? 30 seconds . Look , we gotta take them with us ! Take us where ? We don 't know where we 'll end up . Well , anywhere 's better than here . It 's time . Go . All right . I guess you guys are coming with us . That electrical disturbance just shorted out Mr. Gross 's bed . Could you call maintenance for me and find out what 's going on , please ? Where are we ? A parallel Earth . And we have less than two minutes here . Who are you people ? And what are you doing in this room ? We have a serious problem . My God . We need to know if you can treat her , and we kinda need to know now . Please . This is my mother . You 've gotta help her . I don 't know . I 've never seen anything like this before . But we do have the best plastic surgery team in the country here . I 'm gonna need some information . We don 't have time to explain . Look , you got a good life here ? What ? You 're a professional . A doctor . Do people treat you right ? Respect you ? Yeah . This is a whole new world , Kirk . A better place for you and your mother to start over again . You just have to be brave . All right ? I 'll try . Let 's go ! This may end up making you a media sensation . Use that forum wisely .

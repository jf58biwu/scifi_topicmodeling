 * Have yourself a merry little Christmas * Let yourself be light * From now on our troubles will be out of sight - I almost gave up on you . - Sorry . Checkout lines are worse than rush hour on the 95 . If I heard " Silent Night " one more time , I was gonna start taking hostages . - What are we doing here ? - Stakeout . - On Christmas Eve ? - It 's an important date . - No kidding . - Important to why we 're here . Turn off your car and I 'II fill you in on the details . Mulder , I 've got wrapping to do . It 's the night before Christmas . Let 's hear it . Give me the details . If you 've got Christmas stuff to do ... Mulder , I drove all the way out here . I might as well know why . I just thought you 'd be more ... curious . - Who lives in the house ? - No one . - Who are we staking out ? - The former occupants . - They 've come back ? - That 's the story . I see . The dark gothic manor , the omnipresent low fog hugging the thicket of overgrowth ... Wait . Is that a hound I hear baying out in the moors ? No , actually that was a Ieft-cheek sneak . Tell me you didn 't call me out here on Christmas Eve to go ghost-busting with you . - They 're called apparitions . - Call it what you want . I 've got holiday cheer to spread . I 've got a family roll call under the tree at 6am . - I 'II make it fast . I 'II just give you the details . - OK . Christmas 1917 . It was a time of dark , dark despair . American soldiers were dying at an ungodly rate in war-torn Europe , while at home a deadly strain of the flu virus attacked young and old alike . Tragedy visited every doorstep . Hopelessness set in with every man , woman and child . It was a time of dark , dark despair . You said that . But here at 1501 Larkspur Lane , for a pair of star-crossed lovers tragedy came not from war or pestilence , not by the boot heel of the bombardier , but by their own innocent hand . - Go on . - His name was Maurice . He was a brooding but heroic young man , beloved of Lyda , a sublime beauty with a light that followed her wherever she went . They were like two angels from heaven whom the gods could not protect from the horrors being visited upon this cold , gray earth . And what happened to them ? Driven by a tragic fear of separation , they forged a lovers ' pact so that they might spend eternity together and not spend one precious Christmas apart . They killed themselves ? And their ghosts haunt this house every Christmas Eve . I just gave myself chills . It 's a good story , Mulder , and very well told , but I don 't believe it . You don 't believe in ghosts ? - That surprises you ? - Well ... yeah . I thought everybody believed in ghosts . If it were any other night , I might let you talk me into it , but the halls are decked and I gotta go . - My best to the family . - What are you doing ? - Don 't you have somewhere to be ? - I 'm just gonna take a look . I 'm not gonna do it . My New Year 's resolution . Mulder ? Change your mind ? - Did you take my car keys ? - No . - Don 't kid around . - Why would I take your car keys ? Maybe you ... - Maybe you grabbed them by mistake . - Maybe it was a ghost . That 's a cold wind . There must be a window open upstairs . There must be a window open upstairs . The weather report said there was an 80o % o chance of rain , maybe even ... maybe even a white Christmas . I think the spirits are among us . Quit trying to scare me and help me get these doors open . Sounds like somebody 's walking around upstairs . There . You hear that ? Mulder , I really have to go . - There 's nothing to be afraid of . - I 'm not afraid , OK ? Ghosts are benevolent entities . Mostly . You are not scaring me , Mulder . Look , I really have to get home . Mulder ... - What was that ? - These are tricks that the mind plays . They are ingrained cliches from a thousand different horror films . When we hear a sound , we get a chill . We see a shadow and imagine something that an otherwise rational person would discount out of hand . I mean , the whole ... Mulder ? The whole idea of a benevolent entity fits perfectly with what I 'm saying . That a spirit would materialize or return for no other purpose than to show itself is silly and ridiculous . What it shows is how silly and ridiculous we have become in believing such things . I mean , that we can ignore all natural laws about the corporeal body , that we witness these spirits clad in their own shabby outfits , with the same old haircuts and hairstyles , never aging , never in search of more comfortable surroundings ... It actually says more about the living than the dead . It doesn 't take a degree in psychology to understand the unconscious yearnings that these imaginings satisfy . You know , the longing for immortality , the hope that there is something beyond this mortal coil , that we 'II never be without our loved ones ... I mean , these are powerful , powerful desires . They 're the very essence of what makes us human . The essence of Christmas , actually . Tell me you 're not afraid . AII right , I 'm afraid . But it 's an irrational fear . - I got your back . - Thank you . Did it occur to you that there aren 't ghosts here , but that somebody might live here ? No one lives here . But when you and I were sitting out in the car , there was not a light on . And look at this . Must 've been an electrical surge . Mulder , did you happen to notice the clock downstairs is keeping perfect time ? Is it ? And how do you explain that ? This fire has just gone out . Yeah . Don 't look so disappointed . Why would anyone want to live in a cursed house ? It 's not enough that it 's haunted ? It has to be cursed ? Every couple that 's lived here has met a tragic end . Three double murders in the Iast 80 years , all on Christmas Eve . There 's that sound again . Mulder ? That 's not funny ! I think there 's a hiding space under the floorboards . - What are you gonna do ? - Somebody may be trapped under there . - Mulder , don 't . Not now . - Hey , you have a gun , right ? Rationally , you 've been in much more dangerous situations . Well , I was half right . Oh , my God . Hey , Scully . Look at this . It 's a woman . - It looks like they were shot to death . - Yeah . - You know what 's weird ? - What ? She 's wearing my outfit . How embarrassing . Yeah , well , you know what ? He 's wearing yours . Uh , Scully ? That 's us . Hey , Scully ... This is the same room . AII right . - I 'm beginning to ... get this . - Yeah . You go through that door , and I ... I should come out ... this door . Right . - Mulder ? - Scully ! Scully ! Hey , Scully ! Scully , can you hear me ? - Who are you ? - That 's a question I should ask , being this is my house you 're standing in . - This isn 't one of those home invasions ? - No . Good . Would you Iike me to show you the door ? - That 's very funny . - I wasn 't making a joke . - Have you looked at the door ? - I 'm looking at it now . Tell me what you see . I see a door with the lock shot off it . You gonna pay for that ? That 's a door with a brick wall behind it . OK , sure . You 're playing tricks on me . If I am , I 'm sorry , but I don 't know any tricks . Well , that 's a trick in itself . You 've been playing tricks on us since we got here . Am I to take it we 're not alone ? That 's very funny , coming from a ghost . Yeah , yeah ... The gun fooled me a Iittle at first . You 're a ghost hunter , huh ? And you think I 'm a ghost , huh ? Well , I 've seen a Iot of strange folks come around here with a Iot of strange equipment , but I think you must be the first I 've seen come armed . Strange folks ? Like those folks under the floorb ... - How did you do that ? - I didn 't do anything . There were corpses here , bodies buried under the floorboards . Why don 't you have a seat , son ? - You drink ? Take drugs ? - No . - Get high ? - No . Are you overcome by the impulse to make everyone believe you ? I 'm in the field of mental health . I specialize in disorders and manias related to pathological behavior as it pertains to the paranormal . Wow . I didn 't know such a thing existed . My specialty is in what I call soul prospectors , a cross-axial classification I 've codified by extensive interaction with visitors like yourself . I 've found you all tend to fall into pretty much the same category . And what category is that ? Narcissistic , overzealous , self-righteous egomaniac . That 's a category ? You kindly think of yourself as single-minded , but you 're prone to obsessive compulsiveness , workaholism , antisocialism . Fertile fields for the descent into total wacko breakdown . I don 't think that pegs me exactly . Oh , really ? Waving a gun around my house ? Huh ? Raving like a lunatic about some imaginary brick wall ? You 've probably convinced yourself you 've seen aliens . You know why you think you see the things you do ? Because I have seen them ? Cos you 're a lonely man . A lonely man ... chasing para-masturbatory illusions that you believe will give your life meaning and significance , which your pathetic social maladjustment makes impossible for you to find elsewhere . You probably consider yourself passionate , serious , misunderstood . Am I right ? Para-masturbatory ? Most people would rather stick a finger in a wall socket than spend time with you . AII right . Just back off for a second . - You spend every Christmas alone ? - I 'm not alone . - More self-delusion . - No . I came with my partner . - She 's somewhere in the house . - Behind a brick wall ? How 'd you get her to come with you , steal her car keys ? You know why you do it . Listen endlessly to her droning rationalizations . Because you 're afraid . Afraid of the loneliness . Am I right ? I 'd just like to find my partner . Good . Easy . Piece of cake . Brick wall ? Or brick wall ? Go ahead . Change your life . Mulder ? No , please ! I won 't hurt you . - I 'm a federal agent ! I 'm armed ! - You 're what ? - I 'm armed ! - You said ... - I 'm armed ! - You 're a federal agent ? please , I 'm a Iittle on edge ! Don 't come any closer ! My name is Special Agent Dana Scully , and I can ... I can show you my ID . Oh , my goodness . I thought you were a ghost . I can assure you that I 'm not . I got stuck here looking for my partner . The gangly fellow with the distinguished profile ? - You 've seen him ? - With you in the foyer . I thought he was a ghost , too . - That was you . - I sleepwalk . I thought maybe I dreamed it . But then here you were again . I am sorry . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . I ... It 's just that we found bodies . Bodies ? Where ? Right ... You look like you saw a ghost . There are ghosts in this house , you know . Who are you ? I Iive here , thank you very much . - Where 's my partner ? - Why are you pointing that gun ? There were corpses underneath the floor ! I think the ghosts have been playing tricks on you . I don 't believe in ghosts . Then what are you doing here ? Then what are you doing here ? Where 's my partner ? - He believes in ghosts ? - Yeah . Oh , you poor child . You must have an awful small life , spending your Christmas Eve with him , chasing things you don 't even believe in . Don 't come any closer . I can see it in your face - the fear , the conflicted yearnings , the subconscious desire to find fulfillment through another . Intimacy through codependency . What ? Maybe you repress the truth about why you 're here , pretending it 's out of duty or loyalty , unable to admit your dirty little secret : your only joy in life is proving him wrong . You don 't know me . And you don 't live here ! This isn 't your house ! You wouldn 't think so , the way I 'm being treated . - Then why is the furniture covered ? - We 're painting the house . - Where 's your Christmas tree ? - We 're Jewish . Boo ! Hold it right there ! Don 't make me shoot you ! Just stay where you are ! We really attract ' em , don 't we ? - Where 's Mulder ? - Mulder ? Is that his name ? - Where is he ? - He 'II be along . Move over there ! Both of you , move over there . Move over there ! This violates our civil rights . I have friends at the ACLU . Put your hands up . You see what we 've resorted to ? Gimmicks and cheap tricks . We used to be so good at this . We used to have years to drive them mad . Now we get one night . This pop psychology approach is crap . AII it does is annoy them . - When 's the Iast time we haunted anyone ? - When did we last have a double murder ? Not since the house was condemned . This is embarrassing . Amateur , kid stuff . Look , if we let our reputation slip , they 're gonna take us off the tourist literature . Last year , no one even showed up . Of all days , why did you pick Christmas ? Why not Halloween ? Now , who is filled with hopelessness and futility on Halloween ? Christmas comes but once a year . You 're right . These two do seem pretty miserable . We need to show them just how lonely Christmas can be . Now that 's the old yuletide spirit . - Are you Agent Mulder ? - Who are you , now ? What are you doing using my chair for a ladder ? - Trying to get out of this room . - Trying to get out ? - Excuse me . - No , no , you can 't get out that way . - Masher . - Frump . I don 't know who you 're calling a frump , but I don 't appreciate that . Being manhandled or called names . Certainly not at this hour . - You 're a ghost . - Oh , more names ! - What happened to the star-crossed lovers ? - The romance is the first thing to go . It 's you . You 're Lyda . And that was Maurice . But you 've aged . I hope your partner finds you a Iot more charming than I do . Let 's see . Where is it ? No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ... There it is . I was young and beautiful once , just like your partner . Look at us . Maurice was so handsome . He didn 't have a gut . I hope you 're not expecting great advantages to all this . To all what ? I assume you came here with similar misconceptions . - We came here looking for you . - Oh , yeah ? You didn 't come here to be together for eternity ? No . Because you 're filled with despair and woeful Christmas melancholy ? Why ? - Maybe it was your partner , then . - What about her ? - You knew this house was haunted . - Yeah . Maybe you two should have discussed your real feelings before you came here . I 'm speaking from experience . - What experience ? - I 'm not gonna get into semantics . - A murder / suicide is all about trust . - I thought you had a lovers ' pact . Poetic allusions aside , the outcome , Mulder , is pretty much the same . - I don 't show my hole to just anyone . - Why are you showing it to me ? It isn 't like you 're gonna be eating any Christmas ham , is it ? You 're telling me that Scully 's gonna shoot me ? Scully is not going to shoot me . Suit yourself . But if you shoot first , for her the rest is an act of faith . - I wouldn 't shoot her . - Maybe she shoots herself . I wouldn 't let her . The bodies under the floor ... Maybe that was just some kind of Jungian symbolism . Or maybe there 's a secret lovers ' pact . We 're not lovers . And this isn 't a pure science . But you 're both so attractive . And there 'II be a Iot of time to work that out . Go ahead . Take it . Take it . Think of it as the Iast Christmas you 'II ever spend alone . I locked it . - For your protection . - Stay away from me . Look , I want you to get me out of here . - I am quite capable of pulling this trigger . - I 'm glad to hear it . You may well have to defend yourself against your crazy partner . What have you done with him ? Kept him safe from his own mad devices - at Ieast , for now . You have any idea why he brought you here to this house ? Look , all I know is this is just some bad dream . This is all in my head . And yet here you are , waving a gun at me like your partner . Scully ! Do you realize how seriously disturbed that man is ? How dark and lonely ? What he 's capable of ? - Mulder ! - Want your car keys ? Where did you get those ? He 's got nowhere to go this Christmas and no one to go with . Did he happen to mention a story about a lovers ' pact ? Where did you get those keys ? The man is acting out an unconscious yearning . The deep-seated terror of being alone . Scully ! Scully , are you there ? - I 'm here , Mulder ! - Open the door , Scully ! Open the door . I 've seen it happen ... too many times in this house . I don 't believe you . Just open the door . Open the door ! - Where 's Scully ? - Mulder . Mulder , what are you doing ? Mulder ! There 's no getting out of here , Scully . There 's no way home . Mulder , come on . Don 't come any closer . You 're scaring me . - Put the gun down ! - Are you gonna shoot me ? I 'm not gonna shoot you . I don 't wanna shoot you ! It 's me or you , you or me . One of us has to do it . Mulder , look . We don 't have to do this . - Oh , yes , we do ! - We can get out of here . Even if we could , what 's waiting for us ? More Ioneliness ! And then 365 more shopping days till even more loneliness ! I don 't believe what you 're saying . Mulder , I don 't believe a word of it . Merry Christmas , Scully . And a happy New Year . Let me go ! Let me go ! - Come back ! - Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Scully ! Scully ... Is that you ? - What did you do ? - I didn 't believe it , Mulder . - What did you do ? - I didn 't believe it , Mulder . You didn 't believe what ? I didn 't believe that you 'd do it . That I would . - Merry Christmas , Mulder . - What are you doing ? Scull ... * Have yourself a merry little Christmas * Let yourself be light * From now on your troubles will be out of sight * Have yourself a merry little Christmas * Make the yuletide gay * From now on our troubles will be miles away * Here we are , as in olden days ... Scully ? * Happy golden days of yore * Faithful friends who are dear to us * Gather near to us once more Scully ... * Through the years we all will be together ... * Until then we ' ll have to muddle through somehow ... * Until then we 'll have to muddle through somehow ... I 'm not gonna make it . No , you 're not . Not without me , you 're not . Are you afraid , Mulder ? I am . I am too . * Faithful friends who are dear to us * Gather near to us once more - You should have thought of this . - You should have . - You shot me first ! - I didn 't shoot you . You shot me . * If the fates allow * Until then we 'll have to muddle through somehow Scully ? What ? Get up . I can 't . Get up . We 're not shot . What ? It 's a trick . It 's all in your head . * Faithful friends who are dear to us * Gather near to us once more * Through the years we all will be together * If the fates allow * Hang a shining star upon the highest bough * And have yourself * A merry ... * .. little Christmas now - You hear that ? It 's Christmas . - One for the books . - We almost had those two , didn 't we ? - almost had ' em . Two such lonely souls . Can 't let our failures haunt us . You wonder what they were really out here looking for . Hard to say . People now ... This is just another joyless day of the year . - Not for us . - No . We haven 't forgotten the meaning of Christmas . I don 't deserve to be so happy . I can 't help it . I just can 't help it . Scrooge was better than his word . He became as good a friend , master , Scrooge was better than his word . He became as good a friend , master , and as good a man as the good old city ever knew , or any other good old city , town or borough in the good old world . And to Tiny Tim ... I ... I couldn 't sleep . I was ... - Can I come in ? - Yeah . Aren 't you supposed to be opening Christmas gifts with your family ? Mulder ... none of that really happened out there tonight . That was all in our heads , right ? It must have been . Not that my only joy in life is proving you wrong . When have you proven me wrong ? Well , why else would you want me out there with you ? You didn 't wanna be there ? Oh , that 's ... That 's self-righteous and narcissistic of me to say , isn 't it ? No , I mean ... maybe I did want to be out there with you . You know ... I know we said that we weren 't going to exchange gifts , but ... I got you a Iittle something . - Mulder ... - Merry Christmas . I got you a Iittle something too . * And have yourself a merry * little Christmas now Visiontext Subtitles : Tram Nguyen Zelniker US ENGLISH

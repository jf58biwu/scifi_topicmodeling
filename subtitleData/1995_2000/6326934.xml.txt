Now let 's get to 117 . In 1564 , Nostradamus predicted the destruction of the world , 3 waves terrible . The first wave is here . My name is Cade Foster . That 's my story ... They killed my wife , I was accused of murder ... Now run but not hide . Nostradamus Prophecy guides me . I 'll find ... I 'll hunt ... I 'll stop !

Look to light as Let guide you . The sword has two edges ÅŸtirbitÄƒ . " I spent last year on the run , searching for aliens which destroyed my life . My guide on this journey is a dead prophet named Nostradamus . And if you think that sounds weird ... Just as I thought . But I can not deny that the invasion of this planet already has begun . Tonight I came in a commercial area called , Cosgrove Island . Looking for a man who contacted " Paranoid Times " a website created by a friend and ally , Eddie Nambulous . The man called Harold Shanley . Allegedly escaped a similar experiment in which they killed my wife . And they turned into a fugitive . - Lone Rangers , aici Tanno . - Eddie ? - How 's it going , Foster ? - Surviving . I do not suppose you found it , since I received an email from Shanley . I fumbled . The place is abandoned . What does the mail ? " We found refuge on the island under sunrise . Hurry . They 're everywhere . Shanley . " Sunrise . There is the national symbol of Japan ? Yes . It could be the name of a shopping area ? I do not think . Ships from here look like rusted tinichele . What you got ? Shanley disappeared from Springfield , Missouri 3 weeks ago . Since then hiding all over the country . I assume it 's in a state nervous . Scared , on the run , I do not think clear thinking . Well , now we are two . I have a bad feeling . - You have a gun , right ? - Yes . You need protection , buddy . - We are dealing with aliens . - I know . If you notice something weird , if you smell any setup , take the boat and leave the island . Do me a favor . Check where it came last Shanley 's mail . Maybe we determine location . Otherwise you will have to track down . - Eddie ? - Foster ? The epidermis is smooth . So sensitive . I created it specifically . You have 60 % more DNA than normal . That gives you more power and enhanced senses . Sight , hearing , smell . Why do not you all right ? At this level of analysis would identify human health and then will be captured . If you get caught ... It 's true what they say ? What ? Human sex is pleasure ? It is strictly prohibited to engage in sexual activities human unless the mission requires . You know that Joshua , always follow the rules . Come on honey , you have to Crazy Eddie ? System error . Please defines system error . Mails did not come from Missouri , Nevada . Oh no . That 's not good . Where did they come ? Come on , fool , tell me . Come on , hurry up . All emails came from Cosgrove Island ? It 's a setup ! Damn ! Do not worry Eduardo , honey . It 's just a ride on the other side . There 's nothing to be afraid than fear itself . Sunrise . It was Foster 's . He wore during the experiment . Since it ran , we exhibited more than 15 experiments . Use the guide book of prophecy . - I heard . - Has become " one man army " . - Back soon . - Take care . You know how people greet you break up ? Sorry . It 's called a kiss . When you are on earth do people do . Shanley ? Are you there ? Shanley ? They are everywhere around me . Are you one of them ? - I am Cade Foster . - Do not hurt me . It 's just a preventive measure . We 're here to help . - I read your emails . - You do not know what you mean . Mails you have sent in Nevada ... - Who are you ? - I am Cade Foster . Are you one of them ? No . Mr. Shanley , are on your side . Why should I believe you ? Because I took part in an experiment , just like you . Da . How do I know ? The rest I lied . What others ? Those who have done the experiment . Whenever I return , follow me . All life ! I brought food . Food . Yes ! Yes ! - We have to go . - No , not out . You must leave this place , Mr. Shanley . You need to talk . Let me tell you about what happened , to understand the point . - As soon as you leave the island . - I would prefer to talk immediately . You have to understand the essence , I mention all events . Mr. Shanley , I know you 've been through a lot . What did they do , Mr. Foster ? What have you lost ? Wife . I killed my children . My blood ! My own blood ! I have not had a chance to talk to anyone that day . So , please , let me speak . Let me talk to a friendly stranger , someone who knows the horror . Gotta get out of here . If you do not leave immediately , we will both die . There were 5 incidents in a single day . Arrest , capital punishment , suicide ... I went through complex topics . I saw a friend , Bob Haber , killed son for 16 years . I tried to talk to Bob , but he had a large scar on his forehead . There was nobody to talk to . - What about you ? - That 's the weird part . I left the complex and nobody out a word . - They knew you 'd come after you . - Who ? - Aliens . - What did you say ? Aliens . - Do not play with me . - No do . You 're kidding , right ? Why did you say aliens ? - Because they are back . - No no no ! You said aliens as if you were close to them , as if you were friends . - You heard wrong . - I think you 're an alien . Oh , God ! How I fooled I thought you man . Well my friend , we shake hands and take it in different ways . I do not want to bother you . I came to help you , Mr. Shanley . Calm down . No ! - I can smell the blood of an alien . - Easy . - I killed my children . But you ? - What happened to you , happened to me . - I 'm on your side , Mr. Shanley . - Why me ? We had a good life and I turned it into a bloodbath . I would not never killed children . I would not have killed Tammy and Jimmy never , hunting rifle . I killed the aliens , not my little Jimbo . - I can help Mr. Shanley . - You want to kill me ! You have my word . You promise ? Promise I will not die ? Shanley ! Oh man ! Why do this ? If I 'm drowning , I 'll kill him . - Shut up ! What are you looking for here ? - Thank God ! You live ! - It 's a trap , it 's a setup . - I know . Those emails , did not come from Missouri Nevada , this island 's origin . - You told me that they are genuine . - Foster Sorry , I let you down . But no man could enter my system . Must have used their technology . Do not worry . I brought equipment , walkie-talkie , flags , everything . Where ? You have to be used as bait Shanley knowing that I can find . - You found the Shanley ? - Yes . The poor man was out of his mind . He was attacked by an alien . A broken container and broke his neck . Take care , Foster . They put bounty on your head . No , he wants to kill me , but I 'm already dead . How is it then , take them alive and opens their head ? I do not know . But I tell you one thing . It 's no ordinary alien . I fired five bullets in it and did not flinch . - What do we do ? - Get out of here . Fine wounds . I told you it 's dangerous . It is good that you order to improve our shell . Bullet holes were almost gone . So old Nostradamus gave us the wrong track . Wait , dude . He said , " Answer the call of island trade , but be careful of the footprints that lead you into battle . " To me it sounds like a warning . We follow the prophecy of a man who has been dead for over 500 years . And ? You thought that maybe we need a head examination ? Subject 117 showed me something . I 'm glad you noticed power . No force , Joshua , his weakness . He almost killed himself trying to find Shanley . It has an unusual aggressiveness ... but have compassion . It is a great weakness . His altruism for others , could be exploited . If every man would 117th fighter 's capabilities Foster ? All I destroy . - We anchored the boat next to yours . - I gave a fuck . - Oh no ! - Relax , Eddie . Ce from facebook ? It 's too far to swim , and the current one to kill us . - You have to find another way . - If returns ? He 'll be back . He 'll be back . The wounds are completely healed . I wish I had the same regenerative powers when it comes to you . - It 's the past . - Why run , Joshua . You were my student . I had a connection . As you were warned , the emotional ties between agents are prohibited . I could not resist . That 's why I left . I 'm tied to you . I still feel the connection . We have a job to do . Why when I leave my caravan bad things happen ? We will find a way out . There is no connection between this island and the mainland . Are you sure ? Yes , I checked the map , geographic data , local archives , everywhere . This is an island , a rock . There is no escape . Got something to say ? Well , I had to leave the caravan . - It moves southward . - How do you follow ? I connected cameras and motion detectors to the main computer . - There are two indicators . - It seems that Foster 's friend , came ashore when he realized it was a trap . - Affects experimental protocols ? - Your aim is to assess Foster to report Gua command . Interference others makes no difference . Has excellent training follower , amazing agility and calm when an unexpected attack . Yes , it 's the best fighter . How will we do with it ? How , Foster ? - I 'll leave this island . - How ? - I do not know . - You need to know ! Eddie , you have to be calm . If you can not , at least shut up . Sorry , but my drugs were in the bag . Eddie was 2000 in the bag ? - No . - Take it . - From what ? - Am o idea . - You know , Joshua , home of anxiety caused . - How so ? - These warnings about Cade Foster . - I landed Assembly , Cade Foster that is a force not to be neglected . - Why could not you kill ? - I told you . It 's clever . You 're the best agent of ours . Foster struggle for knowledge . That 's the key to saving the whole race . - It gives power . - It humans . - What year is this map ? - For this year . Certainly this island has tunnels and underpasses . Check another map , one 20 years earlier . All right . No tuner secret pal . - Try 30 years ago . - It 's a waste of time . Try it ! - And a pod . - And a pod ? We are here . We must go to the southeast . - Why is not and recent map ? - Who knows ? But at least there 's a chance . Come on . - Sir , I did not know that there are here . - I 'm leaving . Biological and neural data we receive are incredible . - We realize what motivates 117 . - What motivates can not be measured by machines . Our equipment is extremely sophisticated . Foster has nothing else than normal survival skills . Trina , if you believe that the experiment protocol violation you could make a fantastic benefit of our race , I face this ? I broke protocol ? No , that 's not legal . Even if you know that following the protocol would result in a disaster ? No . This naked ? The protocol was developed by the supreme command . We have a duty to follow him without comment . This is the foundation of military discipline . - Thank you . - Rest a little , sir . - Great . Half missing . - Now we know why it was not on the map . Do not try to be not positive , but I had to hide in tankers . You do not understand , Eddie ? This is an experiment . They could kill us at any time , but I do not . What ? What are trying to find ? They want to see how long until I break your neck . Okay , let 's go back . Hello , Foster ! Eddie , please do not tell me you do not know how to swim . - Are you kidding , I was first in high school . - Good . There are 5 : 00 until dawn . - I do not think we will . - We will succeed . You must run . - Here we are sitting ducks . - No . - What do you mean " no " ? - I 'm tired of running . - The best defense is attack . - Maybe " Dallas Cowboys . " Finally , we will find it . They play with us , Eddie , as they did every time . We must resist . - Foster ? - Da . I 'm scared . Me tooo . - Joshua , what a surprise . - Hey , Foster . You should realize that you are part of the welcoming committee . - That 's not my role . - You observer ? You here to watch ? Do not be rude , Foster . We have made presentations . I know who you are , Edward Nambulouse . Publicist to " Paranoia Time . " I am happy to have visitors and among aliens . Not long ago , our council on this planet gave us the task to see whether we use it or not , lethal force on Earth . The recommendation was thwarted by your actions . Continue . One reason was your ability to destroy the experiments . Consequently , consciousness was transferred on this planet in a human body . We met . It 's hard nice . The consciousness of this body is the best fighter ours . The body contains a significant amount of DNA . Has sensory capabilities stronger than any of us . Its purpose is to test your every level of your potential fighter . Why warn me ? When you return to our planet will give recommendations based on what they learn . This information is used to decide if Terra attack now or later . - How to get rid of the island ? - It 's guarded by our agents , but they share dawn . I 'll try to bring you boat before . Is that all ? Do everything you can to avoid fighting . If you do not , the planet will disappear with you . So , the plan is that the Matadors down it ? Da . Well , if five bullets could not stop it , assume that 2 tons of scrap steel to make a spoil , as sensors would be great . We 'll see . - Make this a lot when you were little ? - Only on weekends . - Do not forget the belt . - Thank you , Eddie . Where were you ? I had problems with two cameras in the eight . - Yes , but where were you ? - I do not understand . Have you visited 117 . Human stench is evident in your clothes . I thought I should be aware of the consequences of this test . What ? Because your recommendation to the Supreme Council , will lead to the impugned decision . - You 're a traitor . - I am a patriot . A supporter of the people . No . I follow these people for decades . I am proud , pathetic and weak . At the individual level can not be measured with us . - I feel sorry for them ? - On the contrary . For most , no . So why jeopardize your career by gaining reputation sympathizer ? Because these people have a quality that we can not yet understand . You talked earlier this compassion . The ability to have feelings for each other , by risking their lives for each other . A powerful force that could lead to our destruction . You 're a fool . - Why did you stop ? - Get out . What do you mean ? There must be both in the car . Cut it . Absolutely not . - We expect Foster . Let 's go . - I 'm serious . If we go to the grave , we go together . We 'll both be killed . Who will keep the flame alive ? Do you have a website . We must warn the world . What 's going to be without you . I 'll lead . - Get you . - How not . You 're a fighter , Foster , I second line defender . - If someone dies , that 'll be me . - Get out ! No . Eddie , have been together for almost a year . And all this time I have not kicked ass ever . Are you threatening me ? - Foster ? - Da . Do not forget to take off your belt . - Are you okay ? - Yes . - I just feel pain all over the body . - But you 're okay ? - Yes . - You defeated Foster . Oh no ! Not again . Come on , Eddie . Merge your phone ? I am almost done with light . - What makes you think that will work ? - It 's too confident . It has every reason to be . - What do you want , Joshua ? - Let me ask you a favor . What ? Remember fundamental lessons underlying military behavior ? " The battles have taken , unless justice is a moral force in the back . " Right . Our planet is dying . We have to find a new habitat or die with it . That 's why we 're here . We chose a planet populated by what I thought inferior species . We were wrong . Nostradamus said " The sword has two edges impaired . " Not you ? Large amounts of alien DNA was added human genes . That said Joshua . It 's strong , but if the DNA is similar to ours , has weaknesses . ... Double edges strength and weakness . I hope you 're right . You are here for a long time . I 'll put it on your loyalty account . How 's it going ? Razor . I monitored every move tonight . - You lose . - I test . The consequences of this test affects both races , theirs and ours . To do the right thing , you have to use your influence Gua to convince not to launch an attack . If you can defeat me , I will . But to kill him . - Killing is not part of the protocol . - It is now . Vine . Are you ready ? - Moving it toward her . - It 's not strong enough . Come on , Foster ! I have an idea . Wait . - Come on , Eddie . - Try , try . Foster can not light on . I can not reach it . For me , Eddie . For me ! That 's it . It works ! - Good night , sweetheart . - Foster , no ! No ! We did it , buddy . We succeeded . Still find one . Yes ! Come on ! We can defeat them all ! Foster , I did it ! He was one of the best . We sent a serious message . I do not know . I feel that this message has nothing to do with their plans . - There will be no boat . - Relax , Eddie . If Joshua had lied and there 's no boat ? See ? Maybe we should have more confidence in it . Absolutely not . Our survival gives us some hope , but also a lesson for the hard days to come . They say there 's nothing to be afraid , but fear itself . When me and Eddie we faced with force that threaten us , I could not win . - Are you ready ? - Yes . You know how to handle this ? - Only on weekends , right ? - Might offend , Eddie . But at the same time , fear is the best protector of our device . If we ignore the things that we should be afraid , we are doomed to destruction . If we are dealing with fear , we can win every battle , defeat any enemy passes over any obstacle . That 's the lesson I learned on Cosgrove Island . Translation and adaptation - Florin thin

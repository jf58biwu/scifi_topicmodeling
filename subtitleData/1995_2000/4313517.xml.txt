 It 's always the same here Dad , nice and quiet . - Chiana , what is this ? - I don 't know ! - Look at it , please ! - Well maybe it 's your ... - It 's my Bassim Oil . - What ? I didn 't take it ! - I found it in your chamber , dear . - Well maybe it ... - Okay , so I took it ! Arrest me ! - Look Chiana ... - and if you leave it out again , I 'll take it again ! - You promised to adapt to our ways . I changed my mind , you adapt to me . - Chiana ... - I 've changed my mind ... Yeah , it 's always the same here , Dad , nice and quiet . it 's late ... Well , it 's space . I don 't really know what time it is . I miss the sun ... days ... nights . Simple things ... anyway , I ... I wanted to tell you about this thing I 'm holding it right now ... it 's my first grey hair . You know , I wouldn 't mention it , it 's just ... that I 'm afraid I might be growing old out here . John Crichton ... You 'd better get up here . I can 't deal with this . Why have the engines stopped ? Okay Pilot , I 'm here , what 's the problem this time ? Moya hasn 't sensed anything like this since the day you arrived . Pilot , how long has that been there ? it just appeared on my scanners , - What are you up to , Crichton ? - Rygel , do you see this ? - Do you see this ? - What is that ? That is a pathetic little waste funnel of which I care little about . We 're supposed to be on our way to the commerce planet , where I believe they have Hynerian marjols . is he the captain ? Because if he 's not the captain , - then how does he get to stop the ship ? - That ... that is a wormhole . Yeah , now restart the engines if you please . What if I wanted to stop the ship ? Crichton ... Look at this ! Oh my God . What ? It 's just a tiny blue planet . What are you getting so worked up about ? It 's got no particle rings , no red moons . Totally unimpressive . That 's earth . That 's my home ! - You going now ? - Yeah ! Pilot says we 're running out of time . I can 't go with you . Aeryn , this could be our only chance . No , this is your only chance . I 'm not certain I 'll belong there . You would , you will , I ... I promise . I 'm sorry . Crichton , wormhole stability down to 57 % . I 'm on my way . That wormhole could blast you out anywhere . - I know ! - Pilot says it 's unsafe and it could ... It could kill me , Zhaan , I know , you 've given me every good reason not to go . I could end up dead , I could end up more lost than I already am . You 've given me every single thing except one . - What ? - This could be earth . This is the way I got here , through a wormhole . It could be my way home . I 've got to do this , Zhaan . Look , however this works out , this could be goodbye ... and I know that you ... didn 't expect me to be here , but thanks ... you saved my life . All of you . Crichton , stability down to 48 % . Yeah , I 'm going , Pilot . Goodbye , big guy ... I ... hope you get your chance one day ... To go see your son . I hope so too . Goodbye ... John . John Crichton ... remember , there 's a part of me inside you ... Take care of it . I will . Sparky ... - What ? - I 'm not taking my stuff ... So , I thought I 'd give it to somebody ... To Aeryn . No , you can 't do that ! Goodbye . 39 % stability . I 'm doing this as fast as I can , Pilot . You 're almost at entry vector ... Just a little more . Now , go now , Crichton . Entry angle confirmed ... Go ! - What 's the matter with him ? - Just go , you lucky prabakto . Go ! - Crichton ... - Yeah , D 'Argo ? I understand the fear ... but if you don 't do this now , you 'll regret it forever . You must go , now ! Do it , John ! 34 % Thanks , big guy . Bring me some luck . John ... can you hear me ? Pilot , are you reading anything from him ? He 's off my sensors ... he 's gone . Pilot , are you tracking me ? Pilot ! Hello sky - y - y - y ! Excuse me ... miss ? Look , I know this is going to sound insane , but this is Australia , right ? What ? Guys ! Where 've you been ? Wait ! I 'm John Crichton ! Let 's go again ... So why did you land in Australia ? I didn 't land , I crashed . - And what is your mission here ? - What are you talking about ? I don 't have a mission . Have you been here before ? I 'm John Crichton ... You know that , Wilson ... What , you ... you think I 'm an alien ? Have you been here before ? Australia ? Yeah , three times . You were here with me last year when I tested the Farscape 's engines , Wilson . So what the hell is going on ? This is the twelfth guy , Wilson . How many more are you going to roll in here before you believe these are translator microbes in my head and not some space virus ? What did he say ? Well , I think he said ... that ... until he gets some answers ... he 's not going to play anymore . Hey Cobb ! When am I getting out of here ? I don 't know . Can I get a newspaper ? Come on ... Cobb ! What am I going to find out ? Look , I 've been away for , what would you say , seven months ? I just want to know what 's happened , something since I 've been gone . Who won the Super Bowl , Cobb ? I don 't know . I know you 're Australian , Cobb , but you gotta know who won the Super Bowl . You know who Ty Cobb is , Cobb ? No ? How about Babe Ruth ? You know who Babe Ruth is ? Some fat guy that played for the Yankees . Good ! Fat guy , at least you know something . You 're kidding me ? This is how he described them . I 'm sorry sir , there 's no access ... Stop , sir ! - Out of my way ! - This is a restricted area , sir ! - Back off , soldier ! - Kill that switch ! Dad ! I 've waited two days , I want to see him , I want to see my son now ! Jack , that 's what we 're trying to determine , whether it is your son . - What have you done to him ? - He 's got foreign microbes in his brain stem and the Farscape module has been modified by non - human technology . You know how this works , Colonel . Once we 've confirmed John poses no threat , then you can see him . I don 't buy that , I want to see him now . Dad ... . Get me out of here , please . I need to ask you some questions . What happened on your tenth birthday ? What ? Tenth birthday ? I don 't know ... I can 't remember . We were living in Annapolis . Annapolis ... Right ... You were late ... again . Why ? You said ... You said they held you in Houston for tests , you missed your flight . but you commandeered a jet and you came anyway . I woke you up at four o 'clock in the morning . You took me fishing . At Sawyer 's Mill . And you caught the biggest damn bass I 'd ever seen . it was a trout , Dad . it was a trout . I missed you , son . What 's going on ? I know recovery procedure as well as anyone , this is way beyond routine . Nothing 's been routine since the day you left seven months ago . That wormhole you went through is still there . You opened a door , son ... A door to earth we don 't know how to close . Get me out of here . Believe I will . I don 't buy this , Dad . What ? Wilson , letting me out . There 's no way he 'd let me out of his sight if what you say is true . - You know Wilson ? - Know Cobb , too . He hasn 't let you out of his sight , son . See that van in the parking lot ? Those two women to our right ? The one in the red with the headphones , you know , sunning herself on the rocks ? Yeah yeah , I see ' em , they 're watching us . They like to get real close . Listen , a global alliance has been set up to track the wormhole . Ray Wilson 's been put in charge by the Pentagon . What the hell does he want from me ? He wants you relaxed so that I can tell whether or not you 're really my son . then he wants to know everything you know about the wormhole , and everything you saw on the other side . Give me a break , Dad , I 'll tell him everything , you know that . I know that . I kept that safe for you . Don 't know if it brought me luck , but it saved my ass . You know , when you disappeared in Farscape 01 , I ... I had to deal with the possibility that you might not be alive . Well , now you know . Now you know how I felt as a kid every time you went on a mission . Come on , son ... we 've got a lot of work to do . They have ... worlds out there , people out there that you wouldn 't believe ... but they do not have chocolate ... Hang on a second . Hey , no , don 't do it like that . it 's a propulsion fin , it 's part of the Hetch drive , okay ? Yes , sir . DÃ©ja vu ... Have we met ? Yes , sir , last year in the Simpson Desert , when you were down there for the shuttle tests . - You were with Cobb , right ? - Yes , sir . Well it 's ... it 's good to see you again . - Sir ? - What 's going on ? Strat Comm from Sector 3 , sir , something else has come through the wormhole . Bring him ! - What have we got ? - There 's an unidentified ship tracking in on the same trajectory as the Farscape module . F16s are scrambling for a visual . - Are they here for you ? - What ? Are they here to save you ? - I don 't know ... - Who is it ? - Who is that ? - Look , I can 't see what ... Who is it ? Who 's on first , what 's on second ! I don 't know , I can 't see ' em ! F16s locked and ready . Wait ! That 's Moya 's transport pod . - Tell ' em not to fire ! - Are they here to attack us ? No , they 're not here to harm us , Wilson , just tell them not to fire . That 's not my call , Crichton . Tell them , Wilson ! They don 't have any weapons onboard the transport ! Tell them not to fire ! Tell them not to fire . After you left , your earth disappeared through the wormhole . it was her idea to see what was going on ... What are they saying , Crichton ? There was nothing I could do . Rygel ... you okay ? No , I 'm frelling sick ! What are they saying ? They 're scared , Wilson , that 's what they 're saying . I 'm not scared , I 'm sick ! What the yotz did you give me ? Son , are you okay in there ? I 'm fine . it 's the tranquiliser , Rygel , that 's what 's making you sick . They 're freaking out , you 're an alien ... and they 're freaking out . I vowed I would never be taken prisoner again . You 're not a prisoner , trust me . I 'm going to take care of you guys . Crichton , I feel frelling terrible . Yeah , I 'm going to get someone in here for you , Rygel . What 's going on ? What 's taking so long ? - Relax , son . - And do what , Dad ? Read a magazine ? They 're all 7 months old , Dad , they don 't want me to have any idea what 's going on . If what you say about those aliens is true , they can help us unlock the universe . - You 're positive , they 're not here to harm us ? - No ... They came looking for me ... they were worried . - Do you trust them ? - A lot more than I trust Wilson . I like ' em Dad , they 're my friends . Sir , we need you in the medical unit . - What 's the matter ? - I think you should see this . Wilson ! We spent our lives waiting for this moment ! We sent Voyager ! We left damned greeting cards on the moon and as soon as they get here , look at what you 're doing . They can help us , just take a step back , and you look at what you 're doing , you think about it . Don 't worry , I 've thought of everything , Commander . You make me sick . The official word is , Rygel died from an allergic reaction to the tranquiliser . What do you think happened ? it doesn 't matter what I think , D 'Argo . No , I think they killed him . You know that those animals killed him . Then they cut him open . They said they were just trying to restart his heart . They were studying him , like an animal , like an alien . Which one of us do you think they 'll kill , next , Crichton ? D 'Argo , it 's not going to go down like that ... I know that you have no reason to trust me ... You 're right , I don 't trust you ... but you tell those humans that when they come for me , I 'll kill them . D 'Argo , don 't ... We 've tried it your way and one of us is dead . Go ! Aeryn ? You know Crichton , Peacekeepers wouldn 't even kill their prisoners to study them . D 'Argo 's right ... Just go . Let me out of here . Son ? I gave them my word , Dad . I told them I 'd take care of them . You were naive to think you could protect them from people like Wilson . I need a favour , Dad . Name it . I want you to call in every marker that you have , every General , every Under - Secretary , every Pentagon mistress . You tell them what 's going on here , and you get them to stop it . What are you going to do , son ? I 'm just going to plead with Wilson , I 'm going ... - to beg for their lives . - No , no , I know that look , John . You be careful . I 'm just going to make him understand , Dad . Son , are you willing to die for those creatures in there ? I gave my word . Did I kill him ? No . Are you with me ? Or them ? I 'm with you , Aeryn ... Trust me . Put down the gun . They know you 're out ? They took D 'Argo somewhere , when the guard came back for me I was ready for him . - Where 'd they take him ? - I don 't know , I 'm not waiting for them to come back . Alright then ... let 's move . Hey Cobb ... ? you find out who won the Super Bowl yet ? What do you want , Crichton ? What is she doing here ? What did she say ? She says she wants to shoot you , Cobb . Now I don 't know if it 's a good idea or not , but I figure since you 've pushed us this far it doesn 't really matter , does it ? Where 's D 'Argo ? They flew him to another base . He 's gone , Crichton , you can 't save him . If you 'd only been reasonable . You 're wrong in what you 're doing here , Cobb . You 're wrong . You 're not going to shoot me , are you ? You 're wrong . That 's for Rygel . Aeryn , pick it up , I want to get out of this rain . This is the place . Rain ... is that what you call this ? I like it ! Aeryn ! Why this place ? My Dad and I stayed here last year , he said we could use it as a safe house . - Your father told you about this place ? - Yep . Crichton , he is with them , this is the first place they will look for us . I don 't think so , I trust him . Ladies first . - So what 's this ? - its beer ... alcohol . Trust me , it 's just what we need right now . Down the hatch . Down the hatch . You like it ? Yes . it 's like Fellip nectar . A Fellip 's a creature on Tarsis and they get the nectar from ... Aeryn , please ... Don 't tell me where it comes from , just drink the beer . Sorry . - What for ? - Everything . What 's happened here , getting you stuck on Moya . I mean , if it wasn 't for me , you 'd still be the happy Peacekeeper dominating the lesser races . I 've got a lot to blame you for , Crichton . - Look at that . - What ? That 's it . Earth . Minus the sunshine . You know , you were right ... it 's actually very beautiful . Were you scared ... to join me , when I left Moya ? Yes . I won 't be recaptured , Crichton . They will have to kill me if they come to take me tomorrow . I know . Get out of bed , John . Morning . Come on , I 've worked out that plan we talked about . Aeryn ... about last night ... Yes , it 's fine John , it 's just not top priority right now . I 've gone through all of these pictures and I 've found a few places that seem to be uninhabited enough to hide in . Aeryn ... You 're right , we ... we have to find a place to hide . - Let 's go ! - No , no , no , you 're not going anywhere ... dressed like that . Are you sure about this ? You look fine , we 've got ... John ? - it 's my father . - I knew it , he 's betrayed us . There 'll be soldiers outside . - No , he won 't , I trust him . - I don 't ! - Are you okay , son ? - Yeah ! You remember , Aeryn Sun ? We actually never met . - What 's she saying ? - He doesn 't have a gun . I 'm not going to search him . is she ever going to put that down ? I don 't think so . What are you doing here ? - Does Wilson know you 're here ? - No . it 's not going to take them long to start searching places we 've been before . - Did you talk to anybody for us ? - Everybody ... No one 's going to help us , son . it 's too dangerous . - And what about you ? - I don 't matter in this . Official word is that these aliens never existed . D 'Argo 's on his way to a military base in Utah and the warehouse has been stripped clean ... Aeryn ! Back off , please . Listen , the two of you have to get out of town and you 've got to find some place that 's safe . - I 'll hold them off here as long as I can . - No ! - No , I don 't want you to cover for me . - This is the only play , son . You 're in this too deep , they 're not going to let you just walk away . At least this time I get to say goodbye . Oh , well ... we 'll hole up somewhere and I 'll ... - I 'll contact you . - No ! If I know anything , they 'll try to make me tell ' em , you just go . Goodbye , Dad . Thank you , Aeryn sun . Why is everyone , looking at me . it 's because they think you look good . - What ? - That girl ... She was on the beach the other day , when I crash landed . That one ! - So ? - I think I know her , I think ... we went to high school together , it was only for a couple of weeks and we never talked ... Yeah , yeah , she looks familiar . Hi , can I help you , mate ? They 're all 7 months old . Why are they all 7 months old ? John , stop it ! I 've seen all these before , they 're from when I left ! What are you doing , John ? - I know you , don 't I ? - What ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , you were the guy on the beach the other day ! - Just keep your voice down . - No , not me . I used to ride my bike past your house in the fifth grade . I don 't know what you 're talking about , I 've never seen you before in my life . Everybody here , Aeryn , I know them all . I know Wilson , I know Cobb , I know you ! John , stop it ! Keep your voice down . What are you doing ? I know everyone ! Get away from me , Aeryn ! Get away ! Back off ! Every place I 've been , I 've been there before . Every place . Greg Cokonis , I dated your sister ! Yeah , here we go ! This is exactly the way I remember it . I know all you guys , don 't I ? it 's a little out of context ... but I know you . How the hell have you been ? Quit . What the hell are you doing here ? Yeah , I 've been here . Been in there . Nothin ' new . But I 've never been in there . - Sir , Stop ! - Make me . - You 're not going to shoot , you 're not Wilson . - Where 's the female alien ? I 'm going to talk to the man in charge and we both know it ain 't you . Who are you ? You did well , John ... most species don 't do as well . What is all this ? Everything here is a physical creation from your memory . - But you 're not real . - Well ... I 'm not your father . - And what about my friends ? - They 're real ... living matter . They were investigating the wormhole we 'd created from your memory . So we decided to use them in our trial . Crichton ... enough is enough . - D 'Argo ! - Get us back home . Ry ... Rygel ? - They didn 't kill you ? - Kill me ? These people treated me splendidly ! They gave me marjols , Crichton ! Lovely hynerian marjols ! Who ever you are , I thank you ! Of course , we didn 't kill him . We created his corpse . Why ? Why would you make me think , that he was dead ? We needed a human reaction , John ... - Your reaction ! - You made me think you were my father . I 'm sorry ... For the trial to have value , you had to believe everything . Let me show you . Are we anywhere near earth ? Actually , we 're not far from Moya . We brought you here to recreate your memory . Well if you can make all this , why not just make a wormhole to take you to earth ? why not just make a wormhole to take you to earth ? That would use all our remaining power . We only have enough left to transport our race one last time . We had to be certain of how we 'd be received . Though space is without boundaries ... there are but a few planets where we can live . So you 're looking to take over someone else 's ? Not take over ... cohabitate , to replenish our hive . The Ancients have stories Of a world that will welcome us ... We can only hope they 're true . You can move closer . Thanks ... close enough . We had to find out whether humans would welcome us or fight us . You stole my memories . I 'm sorry to have taken this form , but I thought the best spy would be a father ... as seen through his son 's eyes . You stole my memories . We had no choice . Show me what you really look like . Many of us hoped that earth might be our welcoming place . If all people were like you , maybe it could be , but they 're not . in your memory we saw millions of Wilsons and Cobbs ... it also led us to a familiar conclusion ... Which was ? That the highest life form on the planet is also the most destructive . Your humans would kill us . So what will you do now ? What we 've done since before I was hatched . We continue searching for a home . So will I. Here . Thanks . Maybe we 'll meet again one day , John . Maybe .

 MR. SIMON ? ARE YOU READY ? YEAH . LET 'S GO . EXCUSE ME , WARDEN . IT 'S 5 : 00 , SIR . HOW 'S NEECH ? HE 'S STILL IN WITH HIS WIFE . NO , I MEAN HOW IS HE ? HOW 'S HE DOING ? WELL , HE WON 'T EAT HIS MEAL , AND HE WON 'T SEE THE CHAPLAIN . - TOLD HIM TO GET THE HELL OUT . - WHAT ABOUT THE HIRED MAN ? HE 'S TRAVELING . ALL RIGHT . LET 'S GET NEECH PREPPED . YES , SIR . [ Door Closes ] IF GOD CAN 'T SAVE HIS SORRY ASS , NEITHER CAN I. [ Door Buzzes ] TIME 'S UP , NEECH ! 2,000 VOLTS , MAN . YOU AIN 'T NEVER COMING BACK , FREAK ! [ Laughing ] [ Woman ] IT 'S JUST LIKE I 'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU . I SWEAR ON MY LIFE , NEECH . TIME TO GO . [ Tapping Bars ] I AIN 'T EVER GONNA LOVE ANOTHER MAN . YOU HEAR ME ? I WON 'T . I WON 'T BETRAY OUR LOVE . EVER . IT 'S TIME , NEECH . TIME TO GO . THAT PHONE CALL 'S GONNA COME , AND THE GOVERNOR IS GONNA COME THROUGH . GOTTA GO NOW . [ Door Buzzes ] [ Door Buzzes ] WE 'VE GOT A HOOD IF YOU WANT IT . IT 'S YOUR OPTION . NO . IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY , NEECH ? LAST WORDS ? YEAH . I 'VE BEEN HERE 11 YEARS , 56 DAYS , AND NOW YOU 'RE GONNA MURDER ME . THE LORD SAYS THOU SHALL BE MERCIFUL AND JUST . I KNOW NO MERCY . ALLAH SAYS THE SPIRIT SHALL RISE AGAIN ... AND BE REBORN INTO THIS LIFE . THE SOUL SHALL BE RECAST , YOU SHOULD BEGIN , FATHER . BORN UNTO NEW FLESH . " THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD- - " I WILL RETURN TO AVENGE ALL THE PETTY TYRANNY ... AND THE CRUELTY I HAVE SUFFERED . I WILL BE RECAST , REINCARNATED , REUNION OF SPIRIT AND FLESH . MARK MY WORDS . FIVE MEN WILL DIE . - SAVE IT . - FIVE MEN WILL GO DOWN ! THIS WILL BE MY JUSTICE ! THIS WILL BE MY LAW ! THIS WILL BE MY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT , AND NO STAY OF EXECUTION WILL BE GRANTED , FOR THERE IS NO PREJUDICE , NO EVIDENCE TO BE ADMITTED , NO LAWYER WHO DID NOT PERFORM HIS JOB . FRY HIM . THESE MEN WILL DIE RIGHTEOUS DEATHS ! - [ Electricity Humming ] - [ Straining ] NAPOLEON " NEECH " MANLEY . HE WAS CONVICTED IN 1984 FOR DOUBLE MURDER ... IN THE HOLDUP OF A FLORIDA LIQUOR STORE . THE ACTUAL GUNMAN WAS KILLED IN THE PURSUIT . MANLEY WAS DRIVING THE GETAWAY CAR AND GOT SENTENCED TO DEATH . HE WAS PUT TO DEATH IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR THREE DAYS AGO . HE 'D BEEN TO THE CHAIR TWICE BEFORE , BUT THE GOVERNOR GRANTED HIM LAST-MINUTE STAYS . THIRD TIME 'S A CHARM . WHAT 'S YOUR INTEREST IN THIS ? MANLEY WAS INTERESTING . HE WAS WELL-READ , CHARISMATIC . HE BECAME A WRITER , A KIND OF PRISON PHILOSOPHER . A WEEK BEFORE HIS EXECUTION , WORD WENT THROUGH THE PRISON ... THAT NEECH SAID HE WAS GONNA BE REINCARNATED . HE WAS GONNA COME BACK FROM THE DEAD . WELL , REINCARNATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN POPULAR ON DEATH ROW FOR OBVIOUS REASONS . APPARENTLY , THIS WAS MORE THAN JUST A DYING MAN 'S HOPE AGAINST HOPE . - WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? - MANLEY DIDN 'T JUST CLAIM THAT HE WAS GONNA COME BACK , BUT THAT HE WAS GONNA TAKE VENGEANCE ON FIVE MEN WHO HAD MISTREATED HIM . YESTERDAY A DEATH ROW GUARD WAS FOUND DEAD INSIDE THE CELL ... THAT MANLEY HAD OCCUPIED THOSE 11 YEARS . HIS DEATH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED . [ Scully ] HAS A CAUSE OF DEATH BEEN DETERMINED ? SUFFOCATION , NEAR AS WE CAN TELL . SOMEBODY MUST HAVE SNUFFED HIM WITH A PILLOW . [ Mulder ] ANY IDEA HOW ONE OF YOUR GUARDS COULD GET MURDERED ... IN AN EMPTY CELL LIKE THIS ? NO . IT 'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN , NOT WITH ALL THE PRECAUTIONS WE 'RE TAKING . I SEE THE GUARDS HERE ALL WEAR PANIC DEVICES . WAS THE VICTIM 'S ACTIVATED ? NO . APPARENTLY , HE NEVER TOUCHED IT . [ Mulder ] ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTS , THERE WERE THREATS THIS MIGHT HAPPEN . THERE 'S ALWAYS THREATS OF VIOLENCE IN HERE . PRISON 'S NOTHING BUT A POLICE STATE , BASICALLY . DO YOU GIVE ANY CREDENCE TO NEECH MANLEY 'S CLAIMS ... THAT HE WAS GONNA COME BACK AND TAKE REVENGE ? NEECH MANLEY . HMM . A SMART MAN . VERY SMART MAN . IN FACT , IF HE 'D STAYED OUTSIDE , I WOULD HAVE FIGURED HIM FOR A NOBEL PRIZE . BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE . PAID FOR IT WITH HIS LIFE . A MAN OF THAT INTELLIGENCE , YOU PUT HIM INSIDE FOR 10 OR 11 YEARS , YOU 'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR IT . - WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? - THERE 'S NOTHING BUT BITTERNESS AND RESENTMENT IN HERE ... 7 DAYS A WEEK , 24 HOURS A DAY , 365 DAYS A YEAR . IT GETS HONED TO A REAL FINE POINT . SO YOU 'RE SAYING THAT MANLEY PLANNED THIS ... AND IS CARRYING IT OUT WITH THE HELP OF SOMEONE ELSE . ELABORATE AS SHAKESPEARE . NOW , IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE VICTIM 'S BODY- - [ Guard ] VISITORS COMING THROUGH ! WOMAN ON THE BLOCK ! WE 'RE HOLDING THE CORPSE UNTIL THE STATE PATHOLOGIST ... COMES DOWN THIS AFTERNOON AND CONDUCTS THE OFFICIAL AUTOPSY . THAT INFORMATION SHOULD HELP US SOLVE THE MURDER . [ Mulder ] DID MANLEY HAVE MANY FRIENDS AMONG THE PRISONERS ? A MAN HAS TO HAVE FRIENDS IN PRISON TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIS ENEMIES . MOSTLY , PEOPLE WERE JUST AFRAID OF HIM . WARDEN ? - WHAT IS IT ? - THE BODY . I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK . I SUGGEST YOU GET IT INTO REFRIGERATION , OR YOU 'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO AUTOPSY . OH , GOD . [ Mulder ] I 'VE BEEN TOLD YOU BELIEVE NEECH MANLEY 'S CLAIMS . IT 'S NOT A MATTER OF HOW OR IF HE 'S COMING BACK . THE QUESTION IS , WHEN ... IS HE COMING BACK AGAIN ? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING , SPERANZA ? YOU BELIEVE MANLEY KILLED THAT GUARD ? - HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN IT ? - A PRISONER WAITS FOR AN OPPORTUNITY- - HEY , LOOK AROUND . WE AIN 'T GOT BUT AN OPPORTUNITY ... TO ITCHY-SCRATCHY OUTSIDE OUR CELLS . YEAH , BUT YOU 'VE GOT PRISONERS ON WORK DETAIL . TRUSTEES . A MAN SLIPS AWAY . THIS IS " Q " BLOCK , DEATH ROW . DON 'T NOBODY COME IN AND OUT OF HERE ... WITHOUT A GUARD WATCHING , AND LATELY , YOU GOT DOUBLE THAT . WHY ? 'CAUSE EVERYBODY 'S AFRAID OF WHAT THEY SAY CAN 'T BE TRUE . - NEECH IS BACK . - REINCARNATED . WELL , HE WOULD HAVE CALLED IT " TRANSMIGRATION OF THE SOUL . " - INTO WHAT FORM ? - YOU , ME , THIS MATTRESS- - I DON 'T KNOW . HE DIDN 'T SPECIFY , BUT HE 'S BACK . I CAN FEEL IT . THE MAN WAS ELECTRIC , YOU KNOW WHAT I 'M SAYING ? PURE ENERGY . WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO SEE THE CELL WHERE THE GUARD WAS MURDERED ? I 'LL OPEN IT UP FOR YOU . - ANY IDEA HOW HE DID IT ? - LIKE I SAID , THE MAN- - [ Wolf Whistle ] [ Man ] YEAH , SWEETROJA ! NOTHING 'S BEEN TOUCHED . IT 'S PRETTY MUCH THE WAY NEECH LEFT IT . [ Flies Buzzing ] DID YOU KNOW NEECH MANLEY ? OH , YEAH . I KNEW HIM . WHAT WAS HE LIKE ? NEECH ? - NEECH WAS SO FULL OF B.S. , HE COULDN 'T STAND IT . - HOW IS THAT ? HE ACTUALLY STARTED TO BELIEVE THAT CRAP HE 'D BEEN PREACHING ALL THOSE YEARS , AS IF KNOWING ALL THEM RELIGIONS MADE HIM SOME KIND OF GOD . - WHO DO YOU THINK KILLED THE GUARD ? - I DON 'T KNOW WHO KILLED HIM , BUT I DAMN WELL KNOW WHO DIDN 'T KILL HIM . ARE YOU AFRAID AT ALL ? ME ? I JUST KEEP MY ASS COVERED AND MY EYES PEELED . SAME AS ALWAYS . [ Man ] FORNIER ! HEY , DOWN HERE ! I 'M GONNA CHECK BACK ON YOUR PARTNER . EVERYTHING OKAY IN THERE ? [ Mulder ] YEAH , WE 'RE FINE . SHH ! [ Whispering ] I 'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU . I ONLY WANT TO TALK TO YOU , OKAY ? I KNOW WHO HE 'S GOING TO KILL . THERE 'S A LIST . ONE OF THE CONS HAS IT . A MAN NAMED ROQUE . WHO ARE YOU ? MY NAME 'S PARMELLY . I WANT TO HELP YOU . [ Fornier ] AGENT SCULLY ? I WAS JUST LOOKING AROUND . NOT A PLACE FOR A WOMAN TO BE DOING THAT ALONE . MULDER . I 'M READY TO GO NOW . OKAY . I 'LL BE RIGHT THERE . GUARD ! WHAT 'S WRONG , SCULLY ? I 'M JUST READY TO GET OUT OF HERE . [ Door Buzzes ] [ Man Laughing ] [ Man ] I WANT EVERY PAINTBRUSH AND PUTTY KNIFE ... TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR , UNDERSTAND ? COME ON , GENTLEMEN , MOVE IT . IT 'S THE GUARD . IT 'S FORNIER . COME ON , YOU GUYS . BREAK IT UP . GET BACK . I SAID GET BACK . I GUESS THEY HAVEN 'T RECOVERED THE BODY YET , SO IT 'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH AN EXACT CAUSE OF DEATH . WHAT DID YOUR PRELIMINARY EXAM TURN UP ? WELL , IT LOOKS LIKE THE HEAD WAS SEVERED JUST BELOW THE JAWLINE ... WITH REPEATED STABBING BLOWS FROM A PUTTY KNIFE . THERE WERE NO OTHER INDICATIONS OF TRAUMA TO THE HEAD . FROM THE EYEWITNESS REPORTS , THERE WERE ALREADY FLY LARVAE INFESTING THE FLESH . THAT SEEMS UNUSUAL , CONSIDERING THE SHORT TIME-OF-DEATH WINDOW . NOT ALTOGETHER . HERE , LET ME SHOW YOU THIS . LUCILIA CUPRINA , BETTER KNOWN AS THE GREEN BOTTLE FLY . THEY CAN LAY THEIR EGGS WITHIN A MINUTE AFTER DEATH OCCURS , AND THEY BREED MORE RAPIDLY IN A HOT , HUMID ENVIRONMENT . IN THE ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENT INSIDE THE PAINT CAN ? ON MY AUTOPSY ON THE FIRST VICTIM , THE LUNGS WERE ABSOLUTELY ALIVE WITH INFESTATION . HMM . WHAT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THAT DEATH ? BEST I CAN FIGURE , GIVEN THE LACK OF INDICATORS , HE WAS SUFFOCATED TO DEATH . EITHER THAT ... OR HE DROWNED . [ Jail Door Unlocks ] [ Guard ] YOU 'VE GOT A VISITOR , ROQUE . - I HEAR YOU HAVE A LIST . - I PREFER NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT HERE . NOT ON THE BLOCK . GUARD ? YOU 'S A DEAD MAN , ROQUE ! YOU HEAR ME ? I 'M GONNA PEEL THAT HEAD LIKE AN ONION ! I 'M GONNA BREAK YOU OFF A BIG CHUNK ! YOU HEAR ME ? HE AIN 'T GONNA TELL YOU NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF LIES ! YOU TALK , PUNK , I GONNA MAKE YOU MY MAYTAG ! HE 'S A LIAR ! HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS LIST YOU CLAIM TO HAVE ? I HEARD NEECH ON THE BARS ONE NIGHT TELLING SPERANZA . HOW MANY NAMES ARE ON THE LIST ? FIVE . JUST LIKE NEECH SAID . SO YOU KNEW THOSE TWO GUARDS WERE GONNA BE MURDERED . I KNEW THEY WERE ON THE LIST , YEAH . WHO DO YOU THINK KILLED THEM ? I DON 'T KNOW . I JUST KNOW WHO 'S ON THE LIST . YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME KIND OF DEAL , HUH ? THAT 'S RIGHT . I WANT A TRANSFER OUT OF THIS HOLE . WHY ? ARE YOU ON THE LIST ? I AIN 'T SAYING NOTHING . NOT UNTIL I GET MY DEAL . WELL , WHAT IF THEY DON 'T GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT ? THEN THEY 'RE GONNA SEE THE OTHER THREE DIE . - CAN 'T DO IT . I CAN 'T MAKE THAT DEAL . - YOU DON 'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY ? NO . IF I MAKE THAT DEAL , I MIGHT AS WELL GO INTO THE DEAL-MAKING BUSINESS . EVERY CON WITH HALF A BRAIN WOULD COME UP WITH A SCHEME LIKE THAT . WHAT IF IT SAVES THREE LIVES ? ISN 'T THAT A DEAL WORTH MAKING ? LOOK , MY JOB IS ABOUT CONTROLLING ANARCHY . I DON 'T RUN THIS PRISON . I JUST PATROL IT . BASICALLY , IT 'S WAR IN HERE . WE HAVE FREEDOM . THEY DON 'T . ANYTHING THESE MEN WANT , SOMEHOW IT FINDS ITS WAY IN HERE . THEY WANT ANOTHER PRISONER DEAD , SOMEBODY 'S GONNA FIND A WAY TO PUT A SHIV IN . THESE AREN 'T PRISONERS . THESE ARE GUARDS YOU 'VE GOT BEING MURDERED . YES , AND IF I BACK DOWN NOW , ALL I 'LL BE DOING ... IS SENDING A MESSAGE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF KILLING PRISON GUARDS . THERE 'S A CONSPIRACY AT WORK HERE . I DON 'T KNOW WHO 'S BEHIND IT . BUT I AM GONNA CRACK IT . THAT 'S MY JOB . OHH- - WHAT THE HELL ? GUARD ! GUARD ! GUARD ! GET IN HERE ! I GUESS HE 'LL BE ABLE TO FINISH UP THAT AUTOPSY NOW , SCULLY . [ Scully ] HE HAD QUITE A LIBRARY . [ Mulder ] YEAH . LOOKS LIKE NEECH MANLEY KNEW HIS BIBLE . LISTEN TO THIS . " I COME IN RETURN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE END ... " TO BEGIN AGAIN THE JOURNEY OF SOULS , THE GODHEAD UNIVERSAL FOR WHOM THERE IS NO DEATH , ONLY LIFE ETERNAL . " WHAT 'S THAT FROM ? NEECH MANLEY , 1994 . THIS STUFF GOES ON FOR PAGES . THERE 'S REFERENCES TO THE HINDU ATMAN , PRARABDHA , THE ROSICRUCIANS , ZOROASTRIANISM . THE MAN WAS OBSESSED WITH REINCARNATION . BEING OBSESSED WITH IT DOESN 'T MEAN YOU CAN DO IT . UNLESS HE KNEW SOMETHING WE DON 'T . LIKE WHAT ? THE SECRET PASSWORD ? EVERY MAJOR WORLD RELIGION ENCOMPASSES THE IDEA OF LIFE AFTER DEATH . THAT MEANS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BELIEVE IN SOME KIND OF TRANSMIGRATION ... OR REBIRTH OF THE SOUL . I 'M SORRY , MULDER . THAT 'S NOT WHAT I LEARNED IN CATECHISM . WELL , EVEN CHRISTIANITY TEACHES ABOUT THE RESURRECTION ... AND ASCENDANCY OF THE HEAVENLY BODY . DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT NEECH MANLEY CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD TO KILL THOSE TWO MEN ? IS THERE ANOTHER THEORY ? A VERY GOOD ONE , AND ONE MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE . THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX SCHEME , THAT THE HEADLESS MAN PLANTED BEHIND THE WARDEN 'S DESK ... IS THE WORK OF A CONSPIRACY OF INMATES . OR GUARDS . OKAY , BUT IMAGINE IF IT WERE TRUE , SCULLY . IMAGINE IF YOU COULD COME BACK AND TAKE OUT FIVE PEOPLE WHO HAD CAUSED YOU TO SUFFER . - WHO WOULD THEY BE ? - I ONLY GET FIVE ? I REMEMBERED YOUR BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR , DIDN 'T I , SCULLY ? WELL , HERE 'S SOMEBODY WE HAVEN 'T TALKED TO YET . SHE SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE . [ Knocking On Door ] MRS. MANLEY ? YES ? WE 'RE FROM THE F.B.I. WE 'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND . I HAD THIS DREAM . HAD IT MANY TIMES . THEY PUT NEECH IN THAT CHAIR , THEN THEY FLIPPED THE SWITCH , BUT THAT HE WOULDN 'T DIE . THEY COULDN 'T KILL HIM . HE 'S A POWERFUL MAN . - A VERY POWERFUL MAN . - DID HE SHARE HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT DYING WITH YOU ? NEECH WASN 'T AFRAID TO DIE . BECAUSE OF HIS BELIEFS ? SOMETIMES- - SEE , I ONLY GOT TO HAVE PERSONAL VISITING DAYS ... RIGHT BEFORE THE EXECUTION DATES . THERE WAS THREE IN THE LAST 11 YEARS . BUT SOMETIMES ... I COULD FEEL THE POWER OF HIS BELIEFS ... RIGHT THROUGH THAT VISITING GLASS . YOU THINK HE 'S COME BACK , DON 'T YOU ? YOU KNOW , I THINK THAT IF ANYONE COULD , IT 'D BE NEECH . [ Door Buzzes ] GET UP , ROQUE . PUTTING ON THE CHAINS . HEY , MAN , FOR WHAT ? THE WARDEN WANTS TO TALK TO YOU . OTHER WAY . WHERE WE GOING ? THIS WAY . LET GO OF MY ARM ! I 'M GOING ! WHAT YOU WANT WITH ME ANYWAY ? STOP PUSHING ! HEY , ROQUE . I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS LIST . I AIN 'T SAYING NOTHING . COME ON , ROQUE , YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH . WHAT ARE YOU SHUTTING UP NOW FOR , HUH ? WHO 'S ON THE LIST ? AM I ON THE LIST , ROQUE ? AM I ON THAT LIST ? IS MY NAME ON THAT LIST ? YOU 'RE NUMBER FIVE . HOW 'S IT FEEL TO BE ON DEATH ROW , WARDEN ? DID YOU CATCH HER BODY LANGUAGE ? SHE WAS NERVOUS ... OR SCARED . OF WHAT ? THAT HER HUSBAND 'S GONNA KEEP HIS WORD ? A LOT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN HER LIFE IN THOSE 11 YEARS NEECH WAS IN PRISON . A LOT PROBABLY DID . YOU MEAN SHE THINKS SHE 'S ON THE LIST ? I DON 'T KNOW , BUT I 'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THAT LIST , SCULLY . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] SCULLY . WE 'RE ON OUR WAY . THAT WAS THE WARDEN . THERE 'S BEEN ANOTHER DEATH . - WHO ? - ROQUE . THEY FOUND HIM BEATEN TO DEATH IN THE SHOWERS ON DEATH ROW . [ Man ] GOTTA GO NOW . [ Gasps , Sighs ] OH , GOD . YOU SCARE ME WHEN YOU DO THAT . WHY ? YOU THINK IT 'S HIM ? WH-WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? I 'M GOING TO WORK . PARM , I 'M SCARED . YOU FEEL ME ? I 'M SHAKING LIKE A LITTLE KITTEN . HEY . NOW WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF ? WHAT IF SOMEBODY FINDS OUT ? I-I MEAN , WHAT IF- - WILL YOU STOP YOUR WORRYING ? EVERYTHING 'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT . HMM ? HE AIN 'T COMING BACK , DANIELLE . HE AIN 'T . HEY . HEY , YOU MOVIN ' IN ? GOT ROOM IN MY CELL FOR YOU , BABY . WHO FOUND THE BODY ? ONE OF MY GUARDS . NO ONE HEARD ANYTHING ? NOBODY WHO SHOULD HAVE . I 'M ORDERING A LOCKDOWN OF THIS FACILITY UNTIL THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL . AS FAR AS I 'M CONCERNED , ANYONE WHO HAD CONTACT WITH NEECH MANLEY ... IS A SUSPECT . WARDEN ? [ Parmelly ] I WARNED YOU . THAT 'S THREE . WARDEN ? WHY ROQUE ? NEECH HATED ROQUE . THEY PRETTY NEAR TRIED TO KILL EACH OTHER ONCE . THEN WHY THE OTHER VICTIMS ? NEECH PROBABLY HATED THEM TOO . DID NEECH HAVE A HISTORY WITH THE GUARDS WHO DIED ? NEECH HAD A SMALL BEHAVIORAL PROBLEM ... ABOUT A YEAR , A YEAR AND A HALF AGO . FORNIER AND THE OTHER MEN HAD TO , UH , DISCIPLINE HIM . HOW BADLY WAS HE BEATEN ? HE TOOK HIS LICKS . SO THERE 'S A PATTERN HERE . A LOGIC . ALL THESE MEN HAD A VIOLENT HISTORY WITH NEECH . THEY ALL CAUSED HIM TO SUFFER PHYSICAL PAIN . WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT ? A LOCKDOWN MAY NOT SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM , WARDEN . SURE AS HELL PUT A LID ON IT . IF IT 'S A CONSPIRACY AMONG THE INMATES . BUT HOW MANY INMATES COULD HAVE PUT THAT BODY IN YOUR OFFICE ? HOW MANY COULD HAVE GOTTEN ACCESS ? YOU 'RE SAYING THE GUARDS ARE INVOLVED ? I 'M SAYING THAT ROQUE MAY NOT BE VICTIM NUMBER THREE . NOW , I NEED A NAME FROM YOU . I NEED THE NAME OF NEECH 'S EXECUTIONER . IT 'S CONFIDENTIAL . HOW MANY MEN KNOW IT ? THREE MEN , INCLUDING ME . WE PLACE AN AD , PAY HIM IN CASH . THERE 'S NO WRITTEN RECORD . HIS LIFE MAY BE IN DANGER . THERE IS NO CHANCE- - LOOK AT IT THIS WAY , WARDEN . IF I 'M RIGHT , IT 'LL REDUCE YOUR LIST OF SUSPECTS TO FOUR . I SAID THREE MEN KNEW THAT NAME . I 'M COUNTING NEECH MANLEY . MR. SIMON ? PERRY SIMON ? COUPLE OF DAYS ' WORTH OF MAIL . MULDER . WHAT IS IT ? OH , GOD . I TOLD YOU , DIDN 'T I ? YOU TOLD ME EVERYTHING BUT WHAT I NEED TO KNOW . WHO ELSE IS ON THAT LIST , JOHN ? I CAN 'T TELL YOU THAT . HOW 'S HE DOING IT , JOHN ? I REALLY CAN 'T TELL YOU . AND YOU 'RE JUST GONNA LET THOSE MEN DIE ? AIN 'T MY CALL ! THEY 'RE GONNA PIN IT ON SOMEBODY ! THEY 'RE GONNA PIN IT ON YOU . THEY 'RE GONNA WHAT ? WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO TO ME ? PUT YOU IN SOLITARY . ONE HOUR A WEEK OUTSIDE YOUR CELL , NO CONTACT WITH ANYONE . THEY SAY IT CAN BREAK A MAN . I CAN 'T TELL YOU , MAN . YOU 'RE AFRAID OF NEECH ? - I SAW HIM . - YOU SAW NEECH . STANDING OUTSIDE MY CELL , BIG AS LIFE . TELL ME WHO ELSE IS ON THE LIST , JOHN . WHO 'S NEXT ? I CAN 'T TELL YOU WHO 'S ON THE LIST . BUT I CAN TELL YOU ROQUE ... WASN 'T ON IT . [ Door Opens ] ROQUE 'S NOT ON IT ? MULDER , CAN I HAVE A MINUTE ? I 'VE JUST BEEN GOING OVER NEECH 'S PHONE CALLS OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS . OVER 30 OF THEM WERE MADE TO A MAN NAMED DANNY CHAREZ , TWICE AS MANY AS TO HIS OWN WIFE . AND ? CHAREZ HAS BEEN HERE THREE TIMES TO SEE SPERANZA SINCE THE FIRST MURDER . HE COULD BE WORKING WITH HIM ON THE OUTSIDE . LOOK , I 'VE GOT NOTHING TO HIDE . OKAY , THEN . WHAT 'S YOUR BUSINESS WITH JOHN SPERANZA ? I WAS TRYING TO GET SPERANZA A DEAL . WHAT KIND OF DEAL ? RETRIAL MAYBE . REOPEN THE CASE . I GOT SOME CONNECTIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT . WHAT KIND OF CONNECTIONS ? I USED TO BE AN ATTORNEY . ACTUALLY , I REPRESENTED NEECH MANLEY . YOU WERE NEECH MANLEY 'S DEFENSE LAWYER ? I WAS 26 . I WAS COURT-APPOINTED . I HAD NO BUSINESS ON A DEATH-PENALTY CASE . WHY HELP SPERANZA NOW ? I HEARD ABOUT NEECH 'S DEATH LIST . WORD GETS AROUND . AND I KNOW HE BLAMES ME FOR HIM GETTING FRIED , SO I FIGURED I GOT TO TRY SOMETHING . YOU THINK SPERANZA 'S GOT SOME SWAY WITH NEECH ? I 'M JUST TRYING TO SAVE MY ASS . I 'VE BEEN TO THE GOVERNOR , SPERANZA , NEECH 'S WIFE- - WHY NEECH 'S WIFE ? MAYBE SHE 'S GOT SOME MOJO WITH HIM TOO . I DON 'T KNOW . ANYWAY , I GOT RUN OUT OF THERE BY HER CRAZY BOYFRIEND . - SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND ? - WORKS AT THE PRISON . WAVING A FREAKIN ' GUN IN MY FACE . - HELLO , JOHN . - WHAT DO YOU WANT ? OH , NO , SIT DOWN , SIT . I 'M HERE TO DO YOU GOOD . WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT ? I WANT TO BE YOUR ADVOCATE . I 'M GONNA GET THEM TO LOOK AT YOUR CASE AGAIN , PULL A FEW STRINGS UP IN TALLAHASSEE . AND WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ? JUST CALL OFF THE DOGS . THAT 'S ALL . WHAT DO YOU SAY ? SCRATCH MY BACK , I 'LL SCRATCH YOURS . ALL RIGHT . I 'LL HAVE SOMEBODY FROM THE GOVERNOR 'S OFFICE DOWN HERE TO SEE YOU BY THIS WEEKEND . [ Clanking ] [ Gasps , Muffled Screaming ] [ Danielle ] WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ? OUT . OUT . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , OUT ? WHAT 'S WITH YOU ? YOU SEE WHO 'S SITTING OUTSIDE WATCHING THIS HOUSE ? YOU SEE THAT CAR OUT THERE ? YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS ? HUH ? IT 'S THE STUPID F.B.I. THEY CAME HERE TONIGHT ASKING ABOUT YOU . ABOUT ME ? SAID THEY SAW YOU ... WAVING A GUN IN SOME LAWYER 'S FACE IN MY FRONT YARD . - THAT 'S CRAZY ! - I THOUGHT YOU SAID NOBODY KNEW ABOUT US . NOW LOOKIT ! JUST LOOKIT . A WOMAN GETS LONELY . SOMETIMES SHE CAN 'T WAIT AROUND FOR A MAN TO BE REINCARNATED . I THINK WE SHOULD NOTIFY THE WARDEN . [ Engine Starts ] IS THAT THE MAN ? THAT 'S HIM . PARMELLY . YEAH , GIVE ME VINCENT PARMELLY 'S WORK SHEET FOR THE LAST WEEK . THANK YOU . NOW , YOU SAY YOU SAW HIM WITH NEECH 'S WIFE ? YES . I HADN 'T REPORTED IT , BUT THAT SAME GUARD ALSO CORNERED ME ... AND MADE AN OVERTURE FOR PRISONER ROQUE . - HE 'S TIED IN WITH ROQUE ? - WELL , DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU ... THAT PARMELLY IS NEECH 'S ASSASSIN ? I DON 'T KNOW PARMELLY THAT WELL . HE 'S A TRANSFER IN FROM OUT OF STATE . HE 'S ONLY BEEN HERE SIX MONTHS . ACCORDING TO AN ATTORNEY , HE HAD BRANDISHED A GUN AT THE RESIDENCE . WHAT ATTORNEY ? A MAN NAMED CHAREZ . - [ Scoffs ] - YOU KNOW HIM ? EVERYBODY KNOWS DANNY CHAREZ . HE WAS FOUND DEAD EARLIER THIS EVENING AT HIS APARTMENT . MURDERED ? SUFFOCATED TO DEATH , OR SO IT SEEMS . WELL , HE COULD BE THE FIFTH VICTIM . I THINK SOMEBODY OUGHT TO GO OUT AND ARREST VINCENT PARMELLY . OH , MY GOD . NO . NEECH . WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING ? - HE 'S HERE . - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? NEECH . I SAW HIM . SOMEBODY 'S HERE , BUT IT AIN 'T NEECH . THEY 'RE COMING HERE . IT 'S YOU , ISN 'T IT ? WHAT ? - YOU 'RE HIM . - YOU 'RE CRAZY , BABY . [ Knocking ] PUT THAT GUN AWAY , DANIELLE . THAT 'S THE POLICE OUT THERE . THIS IS AGENT MULDER . PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR . I SHOULD 'VE KNOWN . I SHOULD 'VE OPENED MY EYES . MRS. MANLEY , WE 'RE FEDERAL AGENTS . OPEN THE DOOR . THE WAY YOU TOUCHED ME . [ Mulder ] DANIELLE ! AND THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE . POINT THAT GUN AWAY , DANIELLE . I 'M TELLING YOU . THEY 'RE GONNA PUT YOU AWAY JUST LIKE YOUR OLD MAN . - DON 'T YOU COME NEAR ME . - YOU 'RE SEEING GHOSTS . MRS. MANLEY , OPEN THE DOOR . [ Knocking Continues ] SHE 'S GOT A GUN ON PARMELLY . CENTER ROOM , FACING AWAY . ON A COUNT . [ Gunshot ] DROP YOUR WEAPON ! [ Scully ] PUT IT DOWN ! PUT IT DOWN ! DROP YOUR WEAPON , DANIELLE . LET 'S GET A PARAMEDIC IN HERE . IT WAS HIM . HE CAME BACK . FORGET IT . I SWEAR IT WAS HIM . IT WAS NEECH . NO , WE 'RE GOING THIS- - WHAT YOU TALKIN ' ABOUT ? SOMEBODY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU . WHAT KIND OF CRAP IS THIS ? WHO WANTS TO TALK TO ME ? WELL , THE WARDEN 'S OFFICE IS THAT WAY . WE 'RE GOING DOWN HERE . UH-UH . NO . MAN , THIS IS BULL ! I AIN 'T GOING FOR IT ! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS , MAN ? WHY DO YOU WANNA TALK TO ME IN THE SHOWER FOR ANYWAY ? WHAT THE- - JOHN . [ Laughing ] HEAR ABOUT YOUR FRIEND PARMELLY TONIGHT ? HE 'S NOT MY FRIEND . OH , HE 'S NOT YOUR FRIEND ? WELL , IT DOESN 'T MATTER ANYMORE ANYWAY , DOES IT , HUH ? YOU PROMISED ME A DEAL . YEAH , WELL , THAT WAS WHEN THERE WAS A DEAL TO BE MADE . WHO ELSE WAS IN ON IT , JOHN ? I CAN TELL YOU . TELL ME WHAT ? I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW . WELL , TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW . NEECH 'S LIST ... GOT ONE MAN LEFT TO DIE . [ Punching , Groaning ] [ Man ] WHAT 'S GOING ON IN THERE ? WHAT 'S GOING ON ? HEY , LEAVE HIM ALONE ! KNOCK IT OFF ! SPERANZA ! WHY ARE WE STOPPING ? YOU KNOW , IT JUST DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . WHAT ? LAYING IT ALL ON PARMELLY . I THOUGHT WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS . IT DOESN 'T BOTHER YOU THAT HE WAS ONLY ON DUTY FOR ONE OF THE GUARDS ' MURDERS ... OR THAT HE WASN 'T AMONG THE MEN THAT KNEW THE NAME OF NEECH 'S EXECUTIONER ? THEN HE WAS WORKING WITH SOMEONE . THEY JUST HAVEN 'T FOUND OUT WHO . WHY WOULD HE COME TO YOU AND TRY AND GET YOU THE LIST ? TO USE FEAR AS LEVERAGE FOR ROQUE 'S DEAL WITH THE WARDEN . BUT NEECH HATED ROQUE . IF PARMELLY WAS WORKING WITH NEECH , HE WOULDN 'T HAVE DONE THAT , WOULD HE ? I DON 'T KNOW . MAYBE PARMELLY WASN 'T STICKING WITH THE ORIGINAL PLAN . I 'M SURE THAT SHACKING UP WITH NEECH 'S WIFE WASN 'T PART OF IT EITHER , OR MAYBE NEECH 'S WIFE KILLING PARMELLY ... WAS THE PLAN FROM THE BEGINNING SO THAT HE 'D TAKE THE TRUTH TO THE GRAVE WITH HIM . I JUST DON 'T SEE THE MOTIVES . DO YOU ? I DON 'T THINK PARMELLY KILLED ANYBODY . WELL , THEN WHO DID ? NEECH MANLEY ? SPERANZA AND NEECH 'S WIFE BOTH SAID THEY SAW HIM . IT 'S OVER , MULDER . LET 'S JUST GO HOME . [ Boy ] I MADE THIS !

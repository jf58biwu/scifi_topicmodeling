 I just cannot believe that they moved us to this lousy table . Yeah , I can see the ice in the urinals , for crying out loud . That 's it , I 'm gonna go talk to the guy in the monkey suit and find out what 's goin ' on . Well , everybody , I 'd like to propose a toast . Uh , no . No , Harry . Let me . To someone who has been an inspiration to us all and a beacon of light in a dark and ominous fog of mediocrity .. to me . - Can I see it ? - I 've been immortalized . Ah , yep . It 's not just anybody who gets to be in the Pendleton yearbook . Only those people who work at or attend Pendleton . Okay , well , Marizio said he can 't give us our table back . He 's saving it for someone important , some bigwig . A bigger wig than I ? Whoa ! Check it out , you guys . It 's Mark Hamill . I cannot believe we had to give up our table for Luke Skywalker . " Ooh , look at me . I 'm so important . My father 's Darth Vader . " He is ? I 'm gonna go over there and I 'm gonna get our table back . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Remember , Sally , he 's a celebrity and therefore our superior . - Uh , you 're mark Hamill , right ? - Yes . - Okay , well , look , I hate to do this , but I really .. - No problem at all . It 's okay . - Here we go . - Um , what are you doing ? Well , signing my name . I don 't need proof , pal ! I know it 's you ! Move over , sweetie . Get up ! All right , here 's what 's gonna happen , okay ? My family is gonna sit here and you guys are gonna sit over there . Hey , how about this : I 'll give you a copy of my new book , and we 'll call it even . Okay , how about this ? Why don 't you book over to that table ? Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm not moving anywhere . I disagree . What ! He seems very down-To-earth . Ooh ! Scrappy . May the force be with you , buddy ! Hey , guys , guess who 's on the front page ? - ? Ta-Da ? Sally Solomon . - What ? " Local woman Sally Solomon put her foot down for the common man last night square on the chest of star wars : special edition star mark Hamill . " This is huge ! " Said Solomon , 'just because I 'm a nobody doesn 't mean I 'm not somebody ' . " Wow , that sounds like they 're making you out to be some kind of hero or something . That 's nice , Sally . Not as nice as being published in the yearbook , but it 's ... Hello ? Yeah , she does . What , today ? Yeah , yeah . Hold on , I 'll ask her . Uh , Sally , they want you to be on good afternoon , Rutherford . That 's my second-Favorite show . - What 's your first favorite ? - Good morning , Rutherford . Why are they making such a big deal out of this thing ? This is a joke , right ? No , it 's not a joke at all . We 're superior beings . The spotlight was bound to find us sooner or later . She 'll be there . - In fact , they 'll probably want to interview all of us . - Yeah . They 'll probably want the perspective of the guy who spent the whole fight hiding in the ladies ' room . I was not hiding ! I was freshening up . When we come back , we 'll meet Sally Solomon , Rutherford 's newest hero . Good afternoon , Rutherford ! Clear ! - Hi . - Hey . - I 'm a big fan . - Oh ! Now , is there anything I can get you ? Soda , water , coffee .. oh , no , I can get it , thanks . Hey , you know , enough already . - Oh , Sally , there you are . - Dick , where have you been ? Putting on my own makeup , for starters . - Where will I be sitting ? - Who are you ? Oh , I 'm Dick Solomon . Perhaps you 've read my book . Why don 't you go sit over there on that couch underneath the air conditioner . Is that where you do emotional family reaction shots ? Uh , sure . Sally Solomon , you took your table back . Well , just ' cause a guy 's famous doesn 't mean he can walk on people . we love you , Sally ! Let 's go to the phones . You 're on the air with Sally Solomon . Uh , yeah , Sally , I just want to say , to heck with Mark Hamill , you should be in the next Star Track movie ! No , I 'm just a homemaker . Just because you 're a nobody doesn 't mean you 're not a somebody ! Wow . Okay , let 's take another caller . Go ahead . Oh , my goodness , yes . I am congratulating Miss Sally Solomon , and I am wondering if she can speak a bit about the brave and , some might say , gorgeous person who made the reservations . Thank you very much . Oh , I think it 's great . Oh , hi , Dick . I saw the show . Sally was wonderful . She has such a presence . Oh . Yeah , that . It 's so exciting to see somebody you know on TV . Yeah , jerry springer had my uncle Jennifer on once . Well , I guess it 's great being on television if you 're one of those people that always has to be looked at .. you know , one of those pathetic types that always needs to be the center of attention . Hello ! I 'm speaking over here ! - I 'm sorry . Did you say something ? - All I 'm saying is , there 's something wrong in this country when people are fawned over for attacking movie stars while brilliant physics Professors toil on in obscurity . Isn 't that what the Nobel prize is for ? Oh , please , don 't get me started on that vacuous popularity contest . Oh , remember what Andy Warhol said . What ? " I bet if I paint this can of soup , some sucker will pay a million dollars for it " ? After that . The thing about everybody being famous for 15 minutes . - Fifteen minutes ? - This is Sally 's 15 minutes . Let her enjoy them . Fifteen minutes ? Oh . Fame is so fleeting . Poor Sally . Hey , Solomon , that lady who decked Luke Skywalker has the same last name as you , " Solomon . " - Yeah , yeah , she 's my aunt . - No way . - Actually , she is . - You are such a liar ! - Let 's get him ! - Wait , wait , wait ! Yes , I will tell her . Okay , I 'll tell her ! Tommy , I 've been trying to call you for two hours . The phone 's been ringing off the hook . Everybody wants to talk to Sally . That last guy was the manager of the scone zone . They want to name a latte after her . Oh , those poor , misguided fools . Even with a generous grace period , her 15 minutes were over hours ago . What a great day ! Harry , could you do me a favor and grab me a mineral water ? - Okay , Sally . - Sally , when 's dinner ? Oh , I ate . - Where ? - Marizio 's . - Marizio 's ? - Yeah , he called the station right after the show . He said he felt awful about how I was treated there . Guess which table he gave me ? - No ! - Yes ! While you were with marizio , I 've been acting like your stupid secretary . I 'll take those , 'cause from now on I 'm Sally 's stupid secretary . Hello . Mm-hmm . Well , it 's kind of short notice . Well , okay . We 'll expect you to send a town car . Oh ! With a driver . Okay . This is big . Sally , you are throwing out the first pitch at the championship game of the Rutherford senior citizens high-arc modified slow-pitch world series . I 've always dreamed . - I 'll lay out your gown . - Just a minute , Missy . I think you 're forgetting something .. our dinner . Tonight I 'd like you to make something stroganoffy . Mmm , I 'm sorry , but due to a prior commitment , Miss Sullivan 's dinner-making will have to be rescheduled . Enough ! Lieutenant , as of right now , I order you to be no longer famous . - You can 't order that . - Think of the mission . This is bigger than the mission ! I didn 't ask for this mantle . The people of Rutherford need a Sally Solomon , and it just so happens I am Sally Solomon . So I will be their Sally Solomon . I can do no less . Play ball ! Hi , hi , hi , hi . More flowers for Sally . Gladiolas . Very nice . Hello , Dubie . Listen , be a love and put them with the others , would you ? Hi , boys . Sorry to keep you waiting . Now , Sally , they just want to do an interview and pop a few photos of you just being yourself . Well , that 's fine . Why don 't I just walk over to my favorite chair and relax like I always do . You know , I did some modeling in my day . 'Course , I had a very bad experience , though . The runway stopped and I didn 't . - Out , out , out , out , out . - Why do I have to stay in the kitchen ? The Rutherford Bugle is having a photo shoot to capture the private side of Sally Solomon , and we need to keep the public out of the way . But , but it 's my living room ! Dick , we 're trying to create an atmosphere here .. you know , something with a little less you . Keep moving , boys ! We 're losing light ! - Don 't they know that I 'm in the yearbook ? - Boy , is this sucking . Would you please keep it down , people ? " People ! " He called us " people ! " No one ... calls us " people " " and then he screamed like a little girl . - That 's great , I love that . - I 've got a terrific idea for a photo . Sally , why don 't you show them how many little debbies you can shove into your mouth at one time ? Oh , yeah , why don 't you let 'em take a picture of you in the kitchen , burning our dinner ? Why don 't you take a picture of her trying to find a boyfriend ? Although it 'd have to be a long exposure . Lies ! Lies ! They 're all lies ! Hey , sorry about our little misunderstanding the other day , Solomon . I guess she really is your aunt . Oh , yeah . Yeah , whatever . Yeah , must be pretty cool living with a celebrity . Yeah , you want to come under the bleachers and throw stuff at the soccer team ? Oh , I have a class right now , actually . Oh . So now your aunt 's on TV and suddenly you 're too cool to hang out with us ? - Let 's get him ! - Wait- - For god sakes , pepper , get out ! Look , it 's that slutty little beagle from next door ! Careful ! Don 't let him in ! Run along , pepper . I 've been trying to get him out for an hour . An hour uh ? That must be an awfully long time in Mary world , where 15 minutes lasts for five days ! - Is this about Sally ? - Yes ! Do you think you could get her to speak at my rotary luncheon next week ? Harry won 't return my calls . - Oh , Mary , you too ? - Oh , Dick , why are you so upset about this ? What do you want ? Fame ! I want to live forever , light up the sky like a flame .. fame ! Don 't blame Sally . She punched out a star and some glitter stuck to her fist . Could have happened to anybody in the restaurant . I never thought of that . My god , you 're right ! Oh , Mary ! How can I repay you ? Glad I could help . No-oo ! Mark Hamill ! Yes . I 'm sorry , sir . There is a line . And you have crossed it . You 're sitting at my table . - What ? - Prepare to be heaved into nonfiction . - Hey , hey , hey , hey . Security . - Uh , we don 't have Security . Not so tough without " Chew-Bacon " around , are we ? - I think I can take him . - Thanks . You know , just because you 're somebody doesn 't mean that I 'm not ... somebody else ! Well , now I see how fame works . When a woman stands up to a celebrity , she 's a hero , but when a man three times his size picks a fight with him for no apparent reason , suddenly he 's the bad guy . It 's just so unfair ! Uh , Tommy , maybe we should get out of here and maybe go grab a rusty burger or something . Oh , well , I thought you didn 't want to be seen with me 'cause Sally was so famous . Oh , let it go , Tommy . Sally is so over . - She is ? - She is ? Yeah , now everyone 's talking about that woman in east Rutherford who 's living on nothing but spices . - What , like paprika ? - Probably . - Hide the paper ! Hide the paper ! - Why ? Because Sally 's not in it . Any phone calls ? - No . - Thank god . Peace and quiet . Peace and quiet . Uh , Harry , where are the fresh flowers that come every morning ? The ones in there are wilted . They did come this morning , didn 't they ? Yes . They came . But they were mums . And I know you don 't like mums , and so I threw ' em out . And that 's what happened . You are good to me . And now I must rest . And to think that I wanted fame . That could have been me . It 's so sad . She was so big . She still is big . It 's the planet that got small . Now if you 'll excuse me , madam needs me . - Yes ? Housekeeping . - Oh , come on in . Mr. Hamill , I will not lie to you . I am not from housekeeping . I 'm here because my Sister , who is your biggest fan in the world , has only 72 hours to live ! Gee , I 'm so sorry . I wish there was something I could do . Actually , there is . Come with me to old downtown Rutherford , where you will be seen with her in a crowded restaurant . She then gets to pummel you and become a media sweetheart . I 'll go get your bags . Oh , this would be nice . You can wear this . Could you get somebody from security up right away ? What do you mean , there isn 't any ? The freakin ' ewoks at the Sheraton had security ! Come on ! - Mr. Hamill ! - He 's getting out ! - Mr. Hamill ! - Help ! We love you , Sally ! Just because you 're a nobody doesn 't mean you 're not somebody . We love you , Sally ! Just because you 're a nobody doesn 't mean you 're not somebody . Sally . - They did love me , didn 't they ? - What are you doing up ? - The phone might ring . - Well , but it 's 4 o clock in the morning . It 's only one on the coast . Sally , I know this must be very painful . How could you know ? You 'll never know what I had . Sure , you 're the high commander of an intergalactic exploratory mission , but me ? I was a star . At least you got to be famous for a little while . It was good while it lasted . How can I go on ? I 'm not famous anymore , I 'm not special . - I 'm nobody ! - You 're not nobody . You don 't have to be famous to be special . The world doesn 't know about Nina and how she goes to the old folks ' home every Wednesday and sings them happy songs despite her busy schedule and their constant requests that she go away . That 's special . Officer Don sometimes takes money out of his own pocket and feeds expired parking meters . To save people from getting tickets ? No , he just hates doing the paperwork . But it 's still special . I know someone else who 's special . Someone who helped to rescue me from an invisible box and took care of a human baby as though it were her very own . It wasn 't someone else ! That was me , you idiot ! You 're the idiot ! That 's my whole point ! That 's why you 're special ! Ohhhh . I guess I am .. special , I mean , not an idiot . Thank you , Commander . - Good night , lieutenant . - Good night . Harry , where 've you been ? Chasin ' the dream , Sally . Chasin ' the dream . Let it go , Harry . It 's over . Oh , no . It 's not over . It 's far from over ! " In an obvious and desperate attempt to cash in on Mark Hamill 's interstellar success , a source close to Sally Solomon last night called the Bugle to tell all of Rutherford that Sally Solomon is in fact an alien from a distant galaxy far , far away . " We 're back on top , Sally ! We 're back on top ! Oh , Tommy , did you show your dad what I wrote in your yearbook ? - Tommy has a yearbook ? - No . - Yes . - Yes . No . Where is it ? In the oven . Yours is slightly bigger .

 The end of another slide . We 've been stuck here for more than two weeks . Everybody 's unhappy and snapping at each other . He 's an irresponsible , unlettered schoolboy and we are his guinea pigs . C 'mon , Professor , don 't talk like that . I 'm tired , Mr. Brown . I want my life back . How much have you had to drink ? Not enough . " In vino , veritas . " In wine , truth . Listen , Professor . It 's God 's will we got stuck in this mess , it 's His will to get us out of it . We 'll get home , you can count on that . Guys , what are you doing in here ? God works in some very peculiar ways . Come on , we 're gonna miss the slide . Keep the change , sweetheart . Thanks . Hurry up , come on . I assure you , Miss Wells , no one is more anxious to leave this world than I am . Nag , nag , nag , like a married woman . You know something ? I could almost handle the mustaches , it 's the beards that trip me out . Can you imagine kissing one of them ? You 'd get whisker burn . Then you 'd know what it was like for a woman . - Guys ! - I found them sitting in a bar . I 'm sorry , man , we were a little caught up in time . All right , let 's go . Hey , what is your problem ? ! You ran right into me . Look what you did to my fender . Didn 't you see me ? This isn 't even my car . I don 't believe this . Believe this , you son of a bitch . Somebody call the police ! That 's Judge Nassau ! Help him , don 't just stand there . Wade , no time . Save your strength . Somebody call an ambulance ! Elsie ... the rock . Here , take this . Five , four ... Stay with me . Elsie ... the rock . Wade , come on . There 's nothing more you can do . Come on . Where the heck are they ? They better get here soon . I hate it when we cut it this close . Quinn , Wade , hurry ! Three , two , one ! Come on ! Come on ! The train 's leaving the station ! Run , Wade ! Quick as you can ! Come on ! Come on , Wade ! What if you could travel to parallel worlds , the same year , the same Earth , only different dimensions ? A world where the Russians rule America ? Or where your dreams of being a superstar came true ? Or where San Francisco was a maximum security prison ? My friends and I found the gateway . Now the problem is finding a way back home . SLIDERS 2x06 " TIME AGAIN AND WORLD " Subtitles subXpacio Mr. Brown , I swear you aim at me deliberately . And you manage to target my backside with the regularity of an atomic clock . Sorry about that , Professor . Hey , what happened back there ? There was a shoot-out . We barely made the slide . Are you okay ? What 's that ? He handed it to me before he died . " Top Hat Night Club . " Some sort of chip . At the risk of appearing redundant , Miss Wells , I would point out that the last time we became involved in the affairs of the worlds that we visit , Mr. Mallory ended up with a bullet in his back . We 're tourists , Miss Wells , we must not become emotionally invested . " Emotionally invested " ? I just saw a man gunned down on the street . Excuse me if that 's a little hard to ignore , all right ? Let it go . How long we got on this place ? 36 hours and counting . 36 hours . Almost enough time for my back to recover from your splenetic and venomed attack . Do you have any idea what you weigh ? Wow , talk about your déjà vu . We 've landed in a world almost identical to the last . Yeah , I 've seen her before . No bearded women . That 's a step in the right direction . Or they just have better razors . Look ! What the hell is your problem ? You ran right into me ! Look what you did to my fender . Didn 't you see me ? I don 't believe this . He 's got a gun ! Son of a bitch ! Judge Nassau shot him ! Call an ambulance ! Judge Nassau shot someone ! Help him ! Somebody call an ambulance ! Elsie ... the rock . 8 : 00 . Five , four ... Elsie ... No ... Is he breathing ? Wade . Oh , God , Quinn . He 's a cop . What do you got ? We 've got some witnesses who saw the crime . Those three over there . Dixon is interviewing the fourth one . There 's really not a whole lot I can tell you . Some people thought the officer fired first . We came from around the corner when we heard the crash . We weren 't really all that close . Cops in kilts - I don 't know . I understand these folks might have got a look at our bad guy . Lieutenant , get me an address . I 'm gonna want to follow up with these people . Okay . I got confirmation from our street contact . Says the girl over there may have shouted a warning to Nassau . Watch her . See where she goes . Okay . All right , I want statements from everybody . Get everything bagged and tagged . All right ? Yes , sir . Maybe I should go back . And tell ' em what ? What do you mean , " Tell ' em what ? " I can identify this guy Nassau or whatever his name is . " Oh great - " I got a good look at the guy on the last world we were on " ? Who says they have to know that part ? Well , we 're just about set up here . As soon as I can get all your fingerprints . Fingerprints ? Um-hmm . I 'm sorry , I overheard . Where are you folks from ? We 're from out of town . Out of town ? Good - very good . Welcome to San Francisco . Down the corridor and to the left - 103 . Thanks . Get me Dietrich . Yeah , it 's Calhoun . We 've got a problem . Damn , " Dragnet ; The Next Generation . " Even the TV cops wear kilts . What 's that mean , everybody 's from Scotland ? Well , that 's quite possible . The Scots are a notoriously dour and repressive people . But they did invent Scotch whiskey , which is a definite plus . You know what I think ? The less we know about this place , the better . I 'll go get some ice . Does anybody want anything ? Hey , you can 't beat yourself up , sweetheart . It could 've happened to any of us . I just feel so awful . He looked like my father . How could he be a cop killer ? Well , maybe this guy 's different on this world , Wade . I mean , things look similar but we 've barely seen the tip of the iceberg . The man 's a murderer , dewy or not , he deserves the full rigor of the law . What are you saying ? I 'm " emotionally invested " ? - Sweetheart - - No , he is ! Yes , Miss Wells . You are emotionally involved . - Dangerously and criminally so . - Don 't start ! All right , inside ! Listen up . Nobody gets hurt . Oh , perfect . Just give me an excuse . Very simple , people . What you saw this afternoon - you want to stay alive ? We 're going to pretend it never happened , understood ? Police may ask you to view some mug shots , give a statement . You don 't tell them a damn thing . Excuse me , ma 'am , we 're relative strangers here and we 're a little in the dark . Listen to me . The only thing you need to know is we are watching every move you make . Do as you 're told or next time it won 't be a threat . Thank you , madam . You have made that perfectly clear . Okay , that did it . Well , that 's marvelous . That dewy hero of yours was obviously involved with the Mafia . Rembrandt , what are you doing ? We 've got 30 hours and some change left on this world . I 'm getting the hell out to the countryside where we 've got a chance to get out of here . Rembrandt is right . We 've had enough guns pointed at us this slide . No . - What do you mean ? - I 'm not going . When the officer was shot , he mentioned the name " Elsie . " Don 't you get it ? That 's the same name the other guy whispered . So they were fighting over a woman on both worlds . So what ? Did you hear those thugs , girl ? They 're going to hunt us down to kill us . A man is dead , Rembrandt . I may be able to help . Fine . You coming ? Okay , Wade . Miss Wells , this is emotional blackmail . Okay , let 's back it up to the motel for a minute . This man and woman who confronted you - Yeah , we can 't figure out how they found us . No one knew where we were except the detective and the check-in guy - " Gomez " something . He 's the day man at the Dominion Hotel . Check it out . Lieutenant , when the officer was shot , he whispered something about " 8 : 00 " and the name " Elsie . " " Elsie , The Rock . " " The Rock " ? - Yeah . - Anything else ? Yeah , a number . " Five-four , " I think . " Elsie , The Rock , five-four , 8 : 00 . " Agent Taylor got the rendezvous . We 've got him . - Really ? - You 've just nailed him for us , Miss Wells . Oh , that 's great . I just felt so terrible . I wish we had more good Americans like you . I 'll be surprised if the big boys don 't authorize a seat for you in the electrocution . What 's the story with these guys ? Are they Mafia or what ? You have heard of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , haven 't you ? Yeah , you mean the A-bomb spies . " A-bomb spies " ? The circus clowns who assassinated President Kennedy . When the full story on Judge Nassau comes out , it 's going to make the Rosenbergs look like jaywalkers . God bless you , Miss Wells , God bless America . They called him Judge Nassau . - Do you think he 's a real judge or something ? - Beats me . He must 've done something horrible if they 're electrocuting him . Wade - those are the same two who busted into our hotel room . Let 's get out of here . First they 're gangsters , now they 're cops ? What the hell 's going on ? I don 't know , but I 'm not sticking around to find out . Keep hope alive ! God save Judge Nassau . Hey , my conscience is clear , you bastards ! What 's he being arrested for ? Don 't you get it ? He knew we were staying here . He can be arrested for that ? I get the feeling they can do anything they want . Come on . Unbelievable , Mr. Mallory . Why didn 't you ask for full police protection ? They people they protect us from are cops . Don 't even try and understand . It 'll give you a headache . Time 's a-wasting , girl . We have to get out of here . What about this chip ? - Wade , it came from another world . We 've got enough trouble . Ow ! - Oh , man . - Nonchalance , Mr. Brown . We 're ordinary citizens of this world . We have nothing to fear . Oh , yeah ? Tell them that . I think it 's okay . Yeah , for now . How are we going to make it to the slide ? That 's the same barmaid . The similarities with the last world are uncanny . Residents were treated to a real-life version of " Presidio Vice " this afternoon , when Judge John Nassau escaped capture in a brazen shoot-out with the FBI that left one agent dead . Judge Nassau , object of a nationwide manhunt , has been a fugitive ... Won 't be long now . I beg your pardon ? Bastard walked right into a bear-trap . ... now that Judge Nassau 's underground ... Yes , I suppose he did . Gave them a run for their money though , I 'll say that . Forgive me , I 'm a stranger to these shores . What exactly was Nassau a judge of ? California Supreme Court . He tried to acquit a guy the FBI wanted guilty . Last of the fundamental Constitutionalists . Constitutionalists ? Yeah , you know , one of those free thinkers . He said things were better before they declared martial law and abridged the Constitution . How long have you been living under martial law ? Hey , Marty , how long ago did they declare martial law ? I don 't know , ' 62 , ' 63 . Early ' 60s , right after Hoover got elected . What , Herbert Hoover ? Herbert Hoover ? No man , J. Edgar - " The Stepfather of Our Country . " Quinn , did you see that ? That chip that the judge gave me . - It 's got to be some kind of CD-ROM . - Let me see . Judge Nassau is a California judge . Thanks to me , he 's walking right into an ambush . I just handed him right over to the cops . We 've got to find a computer . Come on . This thing 's so slow . Need any help , just ask . Appreciate it . If the " Tolson 's " too slow , you might consider upgrading . Your basic clones are gonna be lots faster than the pre-embargo Japanese machines you 'd find on the black market . Uh , excuse me . Could you help me over here , please ? Excuse me . All clear . So , you 're interested in music ? Oh , yeah . We have some of the latest state-approved sounds . " Liberace Unplugged , " " Jim Morrison Sings Irving Berlin " and Kurt Cobain 's " Christmas Album . " Yeah , I can see that . Seen the new Donny Osmond video ? Oh-ho , it 's outrageous . Can you believe all that plastic surgery ? Man , that guy is really out there . How do we know this is even compatible ? We don 't . Looks like some sort of encryption . Hurry up . What 's it look like I 'm doing ? I think I got something . Hey , you 're pretty good with this thing . You 're not the only one who knows his way around a hard drive . - Wait , I could 've - - Here we go . " Right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers and effects ... " " Against unreasonable searches and seizures ... shall not be violated . " So what are you looking for ? " The Spinning Topps . " Who ? The singing group . Rhythm and Blues . Rock and Roll ? Never heard of it . Damn . Hey , you guys won 't believe this . These people have completely suppressed the last 30 years of Rock and Roll . - If only that was all . - That chip the judge handed me - it 's the US Constitution . Listen to this , " Both Aristotle and Plato inveigh against the evils of democracy . Individual liberty is leading us down a path towards anarchy , rampant crime , godless amorality , and the breakdown of the family unit . " J. Edgar Hoover , The Second Gettysburg Address . I see . Thank you for your time . I called the public library and the research department at Bolt Law . Nobody 's ever seen an unabridged copy of the Constitution . They seemed incredibly uncomfortable even talking to me . It 's unbelievable . Huge portions of the main body and almost all of The Bill of Rights were expunged from the record after the Kennedy assassination . That 's got to be why they 're trying to kill Nassau . He 's got the only surviving text . But if they 've already kicked him off the federal bench , what do they care ? He 's trying to go public with it . There it is . There it is . Pull over . Come on , Remmy . This looks like the place . It looks like it 's popular . How are we going to get in ? The " mean green . " Universal language . Okay . People are lining up to get in here ? I don 't get it . Looks like my father 's high school prom . Damn , a whole nation of squares . This reminds me of a solo gig I played in Florida , once . The average age was " deceased . " Two beers . And how old 's she ? 23 . Am I old enough for a cola ? So how 's it going , man ? - Listen , is Elsie working tonight ? - Who ? We 're not really sure of her last name , but we have something that might belong to her . There 's no Elsie here . No Elsie here ? No . This just doesn 't make sense . Let 's get out of here . There they are . Man , I 'll tell you . That was one wild goose chase . Why would he give me that matchbook ? I still can 't figure this kilt thing out . No Elsie . You know , the inebriate in the bar said that J. Edgar Hoover , who was the ex-head of the FBI in our world , was President on this world for 22 years , until the time he died . So ? Maybe they 're not kilts . Maybe they 're skirts . I read a book once - it seemed quite scurrilous at the time - which suggested that J. Edgar Hoover and his roommate , Clyde Tolson , were cross-dressers . What ? Well , maybe on this world , President Hoover was . Maybe it was he that instituted this rather bizarre dress code . That is unreal . Guys , we 're getting sidetracked and we 're running out of time . I just keep thinking of " Elsie The Rock . " Maybe they meant Alcatraz Prison . It 's certainly true that on our world , Alcatraz was known as " The Rock , " but it 's a redundant penal system . It hasn 't been used for years . Well , not here , necessarily . Maybe " Elsie 's " a prisoner and " five-four 's " her jail cell . So you 're trying to imply that Judge Nassau was trying to give a copy of the US Constitution to a prisoner in Alcatraz ? It 's as coherent a theory as any . Excuse me . Excuse me , sir , I wonder if you could settle a bet . I understand that Alcatraz is open to the public . It 's the second most popular tourist attraction in the nation after Hoover 's tomb . So it is no longer used as a prison ? Are you kidding ? Martin Luther King , Jr . , Bobby Kennedy , Sam Kinison - all the famous political prisoners are in there , man . You wouldn 't happen to know who 's in cell five-four , would you ? - " Five-four " ? - " The Rock , five-four " ? Is that Martin Luther King , Jr. or somebody ? Skirt boys ? I beg your pardon ? Secret police ? Do we look like secret police ? Top Hat Night Club . We just came from there . Pirate radio . Radio Free America . Ask for Natalie . Wade , let 's go . We 'll meet you guys back at The Lamplighter . I 'm sorry , Wade . This makes no sense . How can a " geriatric ward " like this have anything to do with pirate radio or " The Rock " ? Everything points to here . It 's got to be here . Excuse me , I 'm looking for someone named Natalie . Natalie ? Yes ? Who are you ? It 's about Judge Nassau . I 've got to get a message to Elsie . It 's a setup . How do you know this ? Elsie , 10 : 00 , The Rock , five-four , the cops know all about it . I came from the judge . Put that away . Okay , come with me . Come on , we go right through here . Let 's go . Quinn , I don 't like this . Hi . I need to talk to Lloyd . Don 't argue with me . Who 's Lloyd ? The voice of Radio Free America . Lloyd Clark . " LC . " That 's " El-sie . " You mean he 's a DJ ? Give me the disk . All right , Natalie , What 's this all about ? This disk , you 've seen what 's on it ? Yeah , sure , it 's the US Constitution . Don 't ask me to explain . As far as I knew , my father had the only copy . - Father ? - Who are these guys ? Er , special agents . Here to secure the judge 's surrender . What ? Once the unabridged Constitution is read over the airwaves , and people realize what rights Hoover took away , my father 's willing to give himself up . Okay , LC , how soon can we get this on the air ? It 's a raid ! This is a raid . San Francisco PD ! Everybody down ! Stay down ! Get that guy ! - Shoot ' em ! - Down , get down ! Police ! Drop ! Stay where you are ! They went that way ! Get back ! Move out ! Move out ! My car ! Over here ! I 'll drive . Keys ! Key ! Give me the keys ! Okay , here . Here . Stay down ! Don 't shoot ! Hold your fire ! Get him out of here . Move it ! Let 's go . Come on , Nassau , move it . Come on ! Let 's go ! The idea was to broadcast the entire Constitution over pirate radio . My father believes that once it 's out there among the people again , it 'll spread like a wildfire . The nightmare is all of this could 've been resolved peacefully . All my father ever wanted was the reading of his manifesto . I don 't believe this . They 've got my father . That 's Gomez Calhoun . Oh , my God . They turned Calhoun . What 's he got to do with this ? Double agent . Quinn , we better get out of here before they see us . Right . Come on , please , please . The arrest of the former justice was the result of intensive interdepartmental cooperation between the FBI and local law enforcement . Authorities in the nation 's capital hailed the arrest as a major victory in the war against subversives . President LaRouche himself was notified of the judge 's capture at 6 : 47 East Coast Time . In Washington , law-makers ... No mention of anyone else being arrested with them . From your lips to God 's ears . It 's 10 : 30 a. m . We slide in eight hours . Don 't even go there , Professor . I 'm not leaving without them . Certainly not , Mr. Brown . That was not my implication . I resent you having that thought . We 'll just have to wait for the next window of opportunity . - How you holding up ? - I 'll be okay . What about your arm ? It hurts , but I 'm more worried about my father . You wait here . They got the judge . I know , we saw it on television . There must have been a million cops . What 'll they do to him ? In a world without civil rights ? Probably execute him on public TV . My friends , we must not mourn this event . That 's right . Because we 're going to change it . How 're we going to change it ? On the phone , you said you had something to give us . Yep . But not yet . Now , look , Mr. Brown , or whatever your name is , we took your call . We 're trying to be courteous . I understand that you 've arrested Judge Nassau and that you 're in possession of a certain CD-ROM disk . What if I said there was another copy ? " No person in a criminal case shall be compelled to be against himself , nor deprived of life of liberty or the loss of property without due process ... of law . " Yeah . Once upon a time it was called the Fifth Amendment ? I represent certain parties who are prepared to trade it and a whole lot more for the judge 's release . You can go to hell . What exactly are you looking for , Mr. Brown ? A pardoning of Judge Nassau and his co-conspirators . Complete and total exoneration and immunity from any further prosecutions - signed by President LaRouche himself . Unacceptable . Then you lose , friend . Thanks for your time . Hey , you un-American - I don 't know who you are or where you came from , but you 're not leaving here . Careful - my friends are at a computer terminal at this very moment and if they don 't hear from me within 15 minutes , they will launch the unabridged US Constitution over the Internet . Millions upon millions of computer hackers will wake up to The Bill of Rights over their e-mail . Now you try putting the genie back in that bottle . It 's a bluff . Be quiet . You try me , Detective . But before you risk the future of this nightmare republic , maybe you ought to call Washington . You 'll take a lie detector that this is the only other copy ? I 'd insist . They 're late . You think they 're calling our bluff ? It 's not a bluff . It is an unenviable choice . One man 's life in exchange for a social contract that could revitalize a democracy . Ideas are great , Professor , but they 're nothing without good people to fight for them . Mr. Mallory ... the idea of freedom is reborn with every generation . Only one generation ever created the US Constitution . Someone 's coming . I want the disk . Not until he 's safely away . Why ? No time for explanations , Your Honor . Come over to the car . Go on , get out of here . The disk ! Right here . It 'll come out eventually , you know . You can 't suppress the truth forever . What do you know about the truth , you traitor ? You moron . You 're about to destroy the most important document in the history of this country and you don 't even know it ! - You want a piece of me ? - Stow it , Ray . Anytime . We 'll be meeting again , " big tough guy . " For your sake , I hope you 're wrong . Well done , my boy . It 's hard to find the words to thank you . Keep hope alive . We 'll try , my friend . We have no other choice . Sir , it has been a privilege to meet you . Your courage and your integrity are an inspiration to all of us . We 're all united in our struggle for a better future . I was prepared to die , you know . I know . I hope you understand I did what I thought was right . Things may not be as hopeless here as you think . Age before beauty . After you . Go , girl ! Are you okay ? Yeah , I think so . You gotta be strong . Both of you . I gotta go . Will I ever see you again ? I wish I understood all this . Where 's there 's mystery , there 's hope . Keep hope alive ! Hey , what 's all this gobble de gook ? I don 't know . Some girl was in here playing on it earlier . What is it , a new video game ? Hold on ... What the hell is this ? Oh - oh , my God . " We , the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union ... " Karen ! Karen ! Come here . " ... establish justice , ensure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense ... " " Promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America . " - It 's the Constitution . - I 'm looking at it . - Check this out ! - This is amazing ! Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

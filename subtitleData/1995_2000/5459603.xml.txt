 - Previously on The Pretender . - Yes , Mr. Parker . Angelo is searching the Internet for any signs ofJarod now . SL-27 . What does it mean , Jacob ? [ Miss Parker ] SL 27 . What does it mean ? [ Tires Screeching ] - Does he have a name ? - They 're calling him Jarod . - He misses his parents . - He 'll forget them soon enough . Kri kra toad 's foot Geese walk barefoot - Found these blueprints in the gutter . - He 's nearby . Find him ! Let 's move ! Go ! - [ Car Door Opens , Closes ] - [ Footsteps ] [ Bottle Rattling ] [ Clanking ] [ Footsteps Departing ] Hey ! - Blue sedan . - Get in ! This is Parker . We 're in pursuit of a blue sedan . [ Thumping ] [ Crying ] [ Man Narrating ] - [ Knocking ] - Christine ! Christine ? - Jarod ? - I 'm sorry , Christine . - I know it 's late . - It 's 3 : 00 in the morning . God isn 't even awake . I know . Listen , I need to move back in for a little while . Not smelling ' like that you 're not . - Please . - Look , Jarod ... I owe you big time for what you did for me , but my husband 's comin ' back tomorrow . - If Axe finds a man livin ' upstairs , he 'll have a stroke . - [ Soft Cry ] Oh , my God . Where did you get it ? A man threw him in the Dumpster . Oh , my God . How could someone do that ? How could someone throw away a baby ? It 's a crazy world . Babies havin ' babies ... people don 't know what they want or what they have . It 's freezing in here . You have to call the police . I 'm the only family he has right now . Of course . It 's just that if Axe didn 't get the job in Houston ... he 'll have a stroke ifhe comes back and finds a baby here . - He doesn 't like babies ? - No . Yes . That 's not the point . - He 's hungry . - How can you tell ? Because I 'm hungry . Wanna ... Wanna lay down ? There you go . There you go . Why-Why would Jarod risk getting caught over a random set of blueprints ? [ Chuckles ] WhereJarod 's concerned , there 's never anything random . Hmm . Boy Genius is a regular I.M. Pei . Wait . What 's this ? SL 27 ? I 'll be around . Kri kra toad 's foot Geese walk barefoot Kri kra toad 's foot Geese walk barefoot Who taught you that song ? I don 't know . My mother , I think . You think ? When I was little , I was taken from my family . I was raised by some people ... people that had no business dealing with children . I 'm sorry . Look , Jarod , I appreciate everything you did for me . That phony lawsuit that lady filed against the shop would have busted me ... - if you hadn 't stepped in , but , still , I can 't let you ... - [ Jarod , Babytalk ] [ Baby Cries Out ] - Holler downstairs if you need any help , okay ? - Christine ? Thanks . - [ Man ] Does he have a name ? - [ Man # 2 ] They 're calling him Jarod . - He misses his parents . - He 'll forget them soon enough . [ Tones Beeping ] - [ Ringing ] - This is Sydney . - How could somebody abandon a child ? - Jarod . I mean , something so vulnerable ... so defenseless . - How could they do that ? - Is this about your parents ? - It 's about all parents . - [ Sydney Sighs ] Well , there 's no easy answer to that . Who knows what , uh ... what pressures some people face . Is this what you were looking for earlier at that architectural firm ? Those blueprints ? Is that a lead to your parents ? You 'll figure it out . Hey . [ Clears Throat ] It 's , uh , for my little girl . She 's very fortunate to have such an attentive father . I , uh , did the search you requested . Found two inactive license plates with " SL 27 , " but both owners died in the ' 70s . SL 27 is also the generic name for an antibiotic ... developed by an Israeli pharmaceutical company in 1983 . That 's beyond the date of significance . Well ... if you told me more , Sydney , I might be able to help . Broots , it 's best that ... nobody else be involved in this . Broots , anything on SL 27 yet ? Uh ... Perhaps you both should have a talk . [ Keyboard Clacking ] [ Knocking ] - Shh . - Still sleeping ' ? Like a baby . - What are you doin ' ? - Setting it up . If anybody files a missing persons report with the police department , I 'll get a signal . Jarod , you can 't keep this child . Last night is one thing , but somewhere ... somebody 's looking for this baby . I 've been monitoring every police channel , every television station , every newspaper . - Nobody 's looking for him . - But , Jarod ... Somebody threw him in a Dumpster . Do you want me to turn him over to that person ? If his mother 's out there searching , I 'll find her . But I 'm not gonna give him to anybody ... till I know he 's gonna be okay . I don 't want him to grow up alone . - [ Baby Crying ] - Are you hungry again ? - That 's not a bottle cry . - How do you know ? Seven younger brothers and sisters . Better change him . [ Crying Continues ] I killed the security cameras , and I swept the room for bugs . - I think we 're safe . - You think ? One never knows in the Centre , do one ? Let 's proceed . This belonged to one of the children my mother rescued from the Centre . Look at this . " SL 27 . " Why did you keep this information secret ? Why , I could ask the same question of you . When my brother regained consciousness , he wrote this to me . Hmm . There has to be a clue in the calculations thatJarod dropped . Broots , keep on searching for that connection . Look , I don 't know if you guys missed it , but , uh ... the only people who know about this SL 27 thing are either dead or comatose . And those people are important to us ... like your daughter is to you . I 'm asking for your help , Broots ... as a friend . Please . [ Buzzing ] What is he doing ? - He appears to be expressing his individualism . - Is that good ? [ Raines ] It 's dangerous . Angelo , I want you to run a check ... on every aspect of Centre security . Every system , every level , every mode of access and egress . Optical , physical , electronic . [ Wheezing ] Everything . Do you understand ? Angelo ? [ Buzzer Clicks Off ] [ Chatter , Baby Crying ] - Excuse me , ma 'am . - I 'll be right with you . Yes , I 'm looking at the file . We 've placed a call to the biological grandparents ... but the status is still unclear . - Sure . Can I help you ? - We 'd like to talk to somebody about a missing ' child . I 'll be one more minute . No , it 's against the law ... to prematurely place a child without the signature of a biological family member . I realize you love the baby , but this is the way it has to be handled . I know this is hard , Jarod , but I think it 's the best thing ... Jarod ? Are you insane ? You can 't just walk out with this baby . - Well , I can 't leave him with them . - Jarod , he doesn 't belong to you . [ Sighs ] I know . He belongs with his parents ... or with someone who loves him . Twenty-four hours . Then we take the baby to the police no matter what . Deal ? Deal . One more thing . Give him a name , will ya ? He has a name . I just have to find out what it is . - What is it ? - They all have red decals . The man who dumped this baby had the exact same decal on the back of his car . What are you sayin ' ? A cop threw this baby away . - Talk to me , Broots . - You 'll never guess what I found out . The architectural firm you chased Jarod from was ... The same one that built the Centre . - How did you know that ? - [ Ringing ] - This is Sydney . - [ Jarod ] Any luck ? - With what ? - Well , hello , Miss Parker . SL 27 . Those calculations , Jarod ... what do they mean ? Just digging up some more dirt on the Centre . - I don 't follow . - Do the math , Sydney . It doesn 't add up . I 'm surprised that Broots hasn 't figured it out yet . - Dirt . - I gotta go . It 's the baby 's nap time . Did he say baby ? I 'll be damned . 6.32 million cubic feet of dirt ... was carted off for the Centre 's underground construction . But the Centre 's 26 sublevels only occupy ... 6.16 million cubic feet . There 's enough missing dirt for another sublevel . [ Sydney ] SL 27 . Sublevel 27 . This is my mother . We 're going to find yours . - I promise . - [ Christine ] Well , that 's a sight . - You and Axe ever think about having kids ? - Axe ? No . No way . Besides , I got the shop to worry about . Any luck with that license plate ? Not yet . I have to get inside the police department ... and find out who was driving that car , but I 'm going to need your help . Jarod , I 've got customers . I can 't go chasin ' ... Christine ? Somebody took my spot . - Axe . ! - Your husband 's gone two weeks , and all you can say is " Axe " ? - How 'd it go ? - Ah , came up empty . Who are you ? Hi . I 'm Jarod . - Who 's this ? - Um , I can explain . Uh ... Would you look at them eyes ? Do you mind ? No , not at all . [ Chuckling ] That 's a fine-looking boy . It-It is a boy ? - Yes . - Hey , hey . - Hey , hey . - You like kids ? Like ' em ? I 'd have a whole tribe if Christy would cooperate . You ever need a babysitter , I 'm your man . I 'll remember that . Better move the truck . [ Woman Over Scanner , Indistinct ] - Anything come over the scanner ? - Not yet . Why did you lie about Axe ? I grew up with seven brothers and sisters . I was the oldest , and my mother was ... Well , she wasn 't what you 'd call " hands on . " What about your father ? He was busy with his other family across town . It was up to me to make sure Ari and William were fed ... and Matty was dressed ... and Jeremy didn 't stay up late , and Ella did her homework . I got out of Little Rock and moved in with Axe . I want to be able to think about Christine for a while . Does that make me a bad person ? No . It makes you human . - [ Man ] See you later , Frank . - [ Woman Over Loudspeaker ] Bill , pick up line two . [ Man ] We better put it up on the lift . [ Woman Over Loudspeaker ] Chuck , come to the parts desk . Hey , sport ... take a look at this unit ? No problem . Accidentally clipped a junkie who decided not to cooperate . Guess he 'll cooperate next time . Get this unit fixed . I wanna get out of here fast . Whatever you say , uh , Detective ... Geary , David W. Those look straight to you ? - Yeah . - I 'll be back . [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Broots ] Okay , it 's right around here somewhere . - What is ? - Sewer access . Broots , the sewer main is on the other side of the complex . I know . Which makes me wonder why there 's a manhole cover right here . Help me , Sydney . - [ Air Hissing ] - Oh ! - [ Sydney ] Can you smell that ? - Smell it ? I can taste it . [ Air Hissing ] After you . How-How do you know it 's not wired down there ? I ran Centre security for three years . I know what I 'm doing . Yeah , well , you didn 't know about SL 27 . Get in . You know ... I 'm not sure my medical insurance covers this sort of thing . Sydney , put some light on me . Ow ! [ Broots ] What died down here ? What didn 't ? Let 's go . Okay . - [ Announcer , Indistinct ] - [ Axe Chuckles ] You see that ? Now sometimes , it 's better to be lucky than good . Me and my old man used to watch hoops on the tube . I figured someday , me and my kid would do the same . Christine told me what 's going on . You really think that cop 's involved ? His name is David Geary . He 's a special investigator for D.A. Mitch Meyers . - Ugh , bureaucrats . - Sounds like you 're not a big fan of city hall . I spent 20 years driving 'a garbage rig for the city . Couple of months ago , I blow out my back lifting ' an industrial bin . City cans me , cuts off my disability checks . I can 't get anotherjob . You 're a garbageman ? Sanitation engineer . - Wow . - You know , Jarod ... I seen a lot of dirty things on the street . But why anyone would want to hurt something as wonderful as this ... is beyond me . Yeah . - [ Beeps ] - What 's that ? A missing persons report was just logged on to the police database . It 's the first match I 've found . Jeanette Connelly . Reported missing by her next-door neighbor ... along with her five-month-old son ... Michael . Hello , Michael . Of course there 's a missing persons on her . She 's missing . Don 't get your panties in a wad . Everything 's fine . [ Woman Over Radio ] Officer 's requesting backup at San Pedro and 9th . [ Broots ] There must be a hundred rooms down here . What was this place ? Whatever it was , it must 've been one hell of a fire that stopped it . Yes . There was a rumor of a fire in the summer of ' 82 . I spent that summer in France with my father . I wish I was there right now . [ Sydney ] Rumor is it was the fire that left Raines ... chained to his oxygen tank . Too bad it didn 't finish the job . [ Broots ] Hey , look . Footprints . And they 're fresh . Whoa . [ Broots ] Who played with toys down here ? [ Miss Parker ] Ajack-in-the-box ? Fascinating . - Broots . - Huh ? - Check out the suit . - [ Broots ] It 's always Broots . [ Yelling ] There 's a ... There 's a bullet hole in his eye . - Come on . - Somehow , I get the feeling he 's the lucky one . [ Beeping ] [ Raines ] What is it , Angelo ? Sublevel security alert ? [ Beeping Continues ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Woman Over Police Radio , Indistinct ] [ Jiggling Lock ] She 's not there . Police officer , ma 'am . It 's not likeJeanette to disappear , not with that new baby . She 's a nice girl , smart . - I told everything to the other policeman . - Other policeman ? - When ? - Ten , 15 minutes ago , before you got here . - [ Man ] Dispatch , this is 36 . - [ Man # 2 ] Go , 36 . [ Man # 1 ] Uh , we found a jumper below the East River Bridge . Female Caucasian , early 20s , no I.D. May have been there a few days . Transporting her to St. Mary 's under suicide watch . Over . [ Man # 2 ] Copy that , 36 . - What aboutJeanette ? - Don 't worry , ma 'am . I 'll take care ofJeanette . [ Broots ] Whoa ! - [ Glass Breaking ] - Oh , God . Syringes ? What is it ? This place has all the components of a sim lab . [ Broots ] I never knew there was another sim lab in the Centre . [ Sydney ] Neither did I. [ Broots ] What the hell is that ? Birthing table . - With shackles ? - [ Pager Beeping ] Uh-oh . - It 's Mr. Raines . - What are you waiting for ? - Miss Parker . - What is this place ? Whatever it was , it wasn 't a filing room . These haven 't been burnt . These were brought here . All these files pertain to the Pretender project . This box is all aboutJarod . What is that ? A hood . Must 've been Jarod 's . Sydney , there is no date of death ... listed forJarod 's parents . As far as these documents are concerned , they were alive when Jarod was brought here . Jarod was stolen . I think you should look at this entrance record . - There 's no names , nothing to follow . - Hmm . But there is a signature by a special expediter who broughtJarod to the Centre . Special expediter ... Jacob . That signature is my brother ... Jacob . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] What ? Raines has Angelo sanitizing the security system . - Does he know where we are ? - No , I don 't think so . - You don 't think ? - Yes . No ! I don 't know ! It was weird . Raines was real suspicious , and Angelo just kept giggling . And , man , you 're not gonna believe his head . Just keep yours cool . - It 's Raines . - He knows . Just grab the files . These files have been collected by someone . - Removing them will arouse suspicion . - This may be our only chance . I want to find out the truth as much as you do . But at this point , caution is key . Detective Dave Geary . You 've got thatJane Doe . [ Jarod ] Come on . Come on . [ Woman ] Still checking , Detective . Suicide attempt . [ Woman ] It 's just not coming up . Oh , here it is . Room 708 . Jeanette . Jeanette , wake up . Please , no more . I don 't need any more sedatives . - I 'm not crazy . - I know . Oh , no , no . I didn 't try to kill myself . There was a man , and he threw me off the bridge . It was a policeman . Why won 't anyone believe me ? - I believe you . - Well , who are you ? My name is Jarod . I 'm here to help you . - He took my baby . - I have your baby . - He 's with me . - Where 's Michael ? He is safe , but we must get out of this hospital . The man who tried to kill you is here . [ Woman Over P.A. ] Dr. Peterson , call your service . Dr. Peterson , call your service . [ Chatter , Indistinct ] - [ Engine Starting ] - [ Tires Screeching ] I was so afraid I would never see him again . Where 'd you find him ? That 's not important . What 's important is you 're together now . Jeanette ... why would a police detective want you and Michael dead ? - Was it because of Mitch Meyers ? - Yeah . Is Michael Mitch 's son ? I was working as an intern in his office . I thought he was good . I thought he meant the things that he said . We had an affair . He said he didn 't love his wife anymore , and he was gonna leave her . I mean , I could barely pay for my rent ... so I told him he had to take responsibility for his son . And ? He said he would do the right thing , and l-I believed him . I mean , I didn 't think ... It 's okay . Detective Geary came , and he told me ... that Mitch wanted to see me because he wanted to help us . And I ... I didn 't think . We just got in the car , and the next thing I knew ... I 'm being dragged out on the bridge , and all I could hear was my Michael crying . I oughta break the bastard 's neck . - Now can we go to the police ? - [ Jarod ] No . We have to play a little politics with the D.A. first . I wanna help . For Michael . Isn 't tomorrow garbage day ? Mitch Meyers , please . It 's urgent . [ Meyers ] Jeanette , listen to me . - When he was born ... - [ Jeanette ] His name is Michael . Right . When Michael was born , I thought I could finally make the break . Then I started thinking how it might look ... my wife , my children , you being so young . Everything I have worked for ... all the good I have done ... it would be going down the drain . - So you tried to kill us ? - No , that 's not what I wanted . That 's not who I am . I love you . Look , if you don 't want the truth played out on the 11 : 00 news ... you have Detective Geary bring $ 50,000 to the alley where he left Michael at 2 : 00 . [ Truck Approaching ] Police officer . You 're gonna have to take this trash another time . We collect it now . You guys don 't know what you 're doin ' . You feeling naked ? A little vulnerable ? It 's terrifying , isn 't it ? Being at someone else 's mercy ... completely defenseless ... like a little baby ... tossed in a Dumpster in the middle of the night . You threw away an innocent baby . - [ Click ] - I 've been waiting for this moment ever since I saw you ... standing in the alley . As district attorney , I have worked hard for this city ... to repair the faith , the belief and the leadership ... of your elected officials . Excuse me . Mrs. Meyers ? Hi . - My name is Jeanette Connelly . ... family values , responsibilities ... Your husband and I have been having an affair . I am a man who believes in commitment . Jan ... my wife of 15 years ... my two beautiful daughters ... Jessica and Lindsay . I know what it takes to build a successful family . It takes honesty . [ Jeanette Over Speaker ] You tried to kill me and our son . [ Meyers Over Speaker ] Jeanette , listen to me . I was frightened of what you might do , might say . Everything I have worked for ... all the good I have done ... it would be going down the drain . - So you tried to kill us ? - No , that 's not what I wanted . That 's not who I am . I told Geary to frighten you . That 's all . I didn 't know he was gonna take it as far as murder . You have to believe me . [ Groans ] Oh ! I almost forgot . Now they 're straight . [ Michael Crying ] - Thanks , Axe . - Bye-bye toJarod . - Hey . Come here . - Bye , Jarod . Thanks , Christine . Hey , little man , it was very nice to meet you . I want you to do me a favor . I want you to always listen to your mom . Never , ever forget her . Okay ? There 's my boy . Hi ! How 're you doin ' ? - Thank you . - Good luck . Thank you . - Say bye-bye , sweetie . - Bye . Bye . [ Sydney ] Broots has circumvented the security sensors . We have 10 minutes . Let 's just take a closer look at those files and get the hell out ofhere . It 's all gone . Raines . [ Sydney ] No . If Raines knew we found those files ... we 'd be dead . Well , if he didn 't take them , who did ?

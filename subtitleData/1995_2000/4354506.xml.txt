 - Previously on The Pretender . - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm your brother . - Jarod , go ! Find our parents ! Kyle ! You had the F.B.I. kill my brother . What have I ever done to you ? You exist . [ Broots ] Someone tried to kill Raines , but the bullet that struck his oxygen tank - They can 't tell which gun it was fired from . [ Grunting ] N-No ! No ! Uh ! [ Screaming ] No ! [ Miss Parker ] Well , my father didn 'tjust vanish . I am not his secretary . You 're supposed to know where he is . - I hate attitude . - [ Phone Beeps Off ] [ Sydney ] Problem at the Centre ? Well , my father 's been at his desk in the Tower at 7 : 00 a.m. for the last 35 years . - Two weeks in a row , he 's a no-show . - That 's weird . There 's a great deal of peculiar activity in the Tower of late . - Now it 's trickling down to us . - [ Broots ] Tell me about it . They even jacked up the prices on all the vending machine . A bag of Funyuns sets me back a buck now . Well , it 's true . Let 's face it : The place has been different ever since - Go ahead , Broots , say it . Ever since Raines was shot . Well , don 't look at me . I 'm no marksman . Hey , I didn 't even want to take a gun , remember ? Well , if I 'd have shot Sterno-head , he 'd be snoring through dirt right now ... instead of filling bedpans in the Centre burn unit . Excuse me . [ Monk ] I have met thousands of men ... - from all walks of life who sought retreat here . - [ Bell Tolling ] But I had never met anyone quite like BrotherJarod . He spent all of his time in his cell . He barely ate ... never slept . But given the severity ofhis nightmares ... I suppose that is understandable . He had such ... sadness in his soul . Not exactly Home And Gardens . [ Sydney ] " DÃ­a de los Muertos . " Day of the Dead . A Mexican festival , similar to your Halloween ... in which cemeteries ... are prepared to welcome back the departed . These morbid images may explain Jarod 's long silence . Clearly some sort of preoccupation with ... death ? - Speaking of death , look at this . - [ Broots ] A hand-carved coffin . [ Monk ] Jarod made it himself . - It was always with him . - [ Sydney ] Hm . This is the same type of blue notebook that his brother Kyle used . [ Sydney ] Jarod 's dreaming ... searching for closure in the loss of his brother . Then , uh ... who 's this coffin for ? What 's it mean , Freud ? - Someone 's going to die . - [ Lid Creaks , Shuts ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Background Chatter ] [ Man ] Who wants to touch it ? You 're sick . Ah , don 't be spooked , Chloe . We 're gonna be dissecting them all year . Joel , you shouldn 't touch the cadaver until the prof gets here . Fernando , I have been waiting all year to get into this class . Besides , I don 't think this one 's gonna mind . [ Screaming ] - Think again . - Oh ! Who the hell are you ? Jarod Howard , your new professor . - Oh ! Oh , that 's not - that 's not funny , man . - [ Scattered Chuckles ] And mocking the dead is ? I want each of you to understand that there is only one unforgivable sin in my class . I will not , under any circumstance , tolerate any disrespect for these cadavers . Underneath each of these plastic sheets lies a human being . Many of these bodies , they come to us unknown and unclaimed ... which means that they died alone and afraid ... with no friends , no homes . Forgotten by their families and thrown away by society . Therefore , they will not be disrespected in this classroom . - [ Door Shuts ] - [ Man ] Take those words to heart . Halloween 's coming up ... and if I hear of a student taking a head or an arm to a party ... I will personally expel them from the program . Dr. Fein , will there be enough cadavers for each group this term ? - Who 's being sick now ? - Well , if there aren 't enough ... there are several pre-dissected bodies from last semester that will be available . I plan on being a surgeon . I need to get a feel for what I 'm going to do . I can 't learn if it 's just pick and point . As a matter of fact , there are more cadavers being delivered after class . So , I will need a couple of volunteers . - I believe that these two ... - [ Mutters ] will be just fine . [ Man ] Mm-hmm . Finally ! Thank God you 're back , Daddy . - [ Chuckles ] - Good news . We found Jarod 's last lair . - Hmm . - Yeesh . I 'll have this analyzed ... - but only God knows what he 's up to this time . - [ Whispers , Indistinct ] - Mm-hmm . - Who the hell are you ? [ Mouths Words ] Ah . Nein , nein . [ Speaking German ] - Wiedersehen . - [ Phone Beeps Off ] You must be Miss Parker . You look just like your mother . Where 's my father ? He 's away , as I understand it . [ Beeping ] - [ Woman ] Mr. Lyle , your 10.30 is here . - Oh , send her in . - [ Sighs ] - And , uh ... what , Mr. Lyle , are you doing in my father 's office ? Oh , I 'm just ... filling in . Brigitte , good morning . Have you met Miss Parker ? - Brigitte is the new Cleaner . - The new Cleaner ? I 've had the diorama analyzed . A preliminary report on my findings . How did she get a report on Jarod 's last lair when Sydney and I just returned ? To be honest , Brigitte actually beat you there . Only by a couple days . Huh . Okay . Don 't flip out . What , am I in The Twilight Zone ? We thought it would be a good idea to have Brigitte ... provide assistance in the capture ofJarod . I don 't need assistance . And who exactly is " we " ? - [ Glass Clinks ] - I am . The powers are tired of the way things have been run . They 're tired of the inefficiency , angry thatJarod 's still out there . I don 't understand why it 's so hard to capture one man . Jarod 's not just a man . He 's a Pretender ... a human chameleon ... a genius who can literally become anyone that he wants to be . And he almost found his family , Miss Parker . - Imagine the ramifications . - I know . - But we have made progress . - Yes . " We . " Is this Sydney an impediment ? Or ... should he be removed ? Sydney raised Jarod . There 's an emotional umbilical between them . Sever it and you 'll never seeJarod again . [ Mr. Lyle ] The Centre is tired ofJarod 's actions . lfhe 's really as smart as you say he is ... and you are really as smart as I hear you are ... I 'd think you 'd welcome any help you could get ... since that 'd be the wise thing to do . We 're gonna be late . If you hear from your father , let me know . Well , Jarod , your C. V. is quite impressive . Well , Jarod , your C. V. is quite impressive . Undergrad from Vanderbilt , master 's in anatomy from Duke ... graduated with distinction from University of London . Great accomplishments for a young man . Well , I 'm a quick study . I must admit . I 'm a little surprised ... you 'd be willing to teach gross anatomy to first-year med students . Actually , I 'm here to work with you . I 've been following your progress as a research fellow . I understand you 've made some great strides with a cardiac resuscitation drug . My guess , from your history , it 's a blend between class-four acetylcholines ... and some sort of generic digitalis . - It 's supposed to be a secret . - A pharmaceutical research race with the Brits - - You can 't keep that sort of thing quiet . - You 're a smart man , Jarod . You should 've been an M.D. instead of a Ph.D. Well , either way , they still call me " Dr. " - Dr. Howard ! Dr. Fein ! Dr. Howard ! You - Oh ! - See what I mean ? Joel , Fernando , take the cadavers to the cold room ... - and give them a muslin formaldehyde wrap . - Oh , I already did it . Joel works part-time at the mortuary . Sheldon Fein . - Jarod Howard , faculty . - Hi . - Fein and Fein ? - Sheldon and I are brothers . Christopher became a doctor , trying to put the family business out ofbusiness . [ Chuckles ] Fernando , there 's Detective Keyes . Maybe you should go talk to her . Maybe she found something . [ Car Horn Honks ] - I need to get out of here . - Joel , the vouchers for these bodies are on my desk . - Get them for Sheldon , will you ? - Yeah , sure . Just , uh , send them over . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Fernando seems sad . Yeah , he should . His brother disappeared last Halloween . I 'll take this body to the lab . [ Miss Parker ] Who the hell is Mr. Lyle ? [ Broots ] All I know is he 's been barking a lot of orders ... and all the smart people seem to be following them . - [ Sydney ] Maybe he 's part of the Triumvirate . - The Triumvirate ? - [ Miss Parker ] What the hell would they be doing here ? - [ Sydney ] Seizing power . Their appearance certainly would explain your father 's disappearance . Not to mention the price of Funyuns . Why would they make my father disappear ? 'Cause ... someone shot Raines . Hm . And they 're not gonna stop till they find out who did . Well , I 'm not going to stop until I find out who Mr. Lyle is . Yo . ! Don 't tell me you 're movin 'into this dump . ! They say it 's haunted . - The house ? - No , the fence . Place is prime Halloween target . I 'm talkin ' egging , toilet paper , smashed pumpkins . Tell you what . For 50 bucks , I 'll make sure nobody trashes it . I 've heard about this " Halloween " - a ritual where people bring body parts to celebrations ? Ain 't been invited to one of those . Around here , it 's mostly teens raising hell ... or kids doin the trick-or-treat thing . Trick or treat ? What are you ? From Bosnia ? Trick or treat ! Where kids dressed up like goons go knock on people 's doors and people give them candy . Oh . Why ? Because they know you 're coming . And if they don 't , you might trash their house . - So it 's extortion . - Now you 're catchin ' on , Bosnia boy . Remember , 50 bucks . Money well spent . Name 's Bruno . - You need enforcement around here ? I 'm the man . - I 'll remember . Now take your rib spreader , crack open the sternum ... allowing access to the heart . - [ Squishing ] - [ Sighs ] Oh , man . It is amazing to think that that once pumped life through this body . Now , in order to remove the cadaver 's heart ... carefully dissect through the pericardial sac . Now remove the attachments of the aorta ... and the pulmonary veins and arteries . There shouldn 't be much fluid . Excuse me . [ Chuckles ] I 'll go make sure he doesn 't get it on his shoes . Mm . The ancient Greeks believed that the brain was the home of the consciousness . And the heart was the home of the soul . That 's an interesting crucifix . I spent some time in Cuernavaca . The artisans there , they make one very similar . They made this one . My-My grandmother 's from Cuernavaca . She raised us after my parents were killed . She gave my brother Enrique and me identical ones ... before we came here to go to school for good luck . I heard about your brother 's disappearance . I 'm sorry . They say in some cultures that the bond between brothers can be so strong ... they can feel each other 's pain . - Can you feel his ? - Do you have a brother ? - Yes . - Do you feel his pain ? Every day . I feel my brother in my heart ... but he can 't feel me anymore . Enrique 's luck ran out . I just hope that when his heart stopped ... he didn 't feel any pain . [ Grunting , Screaming ] [ Screaming ] No ! [ Grunts ] Where am I ? [ Grunts ] Where am I ? Where am I ? Where am I ? - [ On Phone ] Sydney . - Jarod . It 's been too long . Part of my life is missing . - [ Thunderclaps ] - You sound troubled . Exhausted . I can 't sleep . This could be the processing of your emotions ... regarding the loss of family . - Your brother ? - No , I understand that pain . This is different . Every time I close my eyes ... I go somewhere - somewhere terrible . [ Screaming ] No ! I get to this same point in this living nightmare , but I - I can 't finish it . I - I can 't go on . Perhaps your subconscious doesn 't want to face what lies ahead . Let me help you . Tell me where you are . - You tell me where I was . - Where you were ? My entire life is on these D.S.A. ' s ... from the moment you people stole me to the moment I escaped . Every breath I took , every sim I did , every morsel of food I ate . Except for the last three weeks in October , the year before I escaped . - There must be a mistake . - There is no mistake . Three weeks of my life is missing . Now , I don 't know how I know , but it has something to do with my fear - with my nightmare . I need to know what happened . [ Grunting ] Hey ! I need to know what you did to me . I need to know . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - [ Door Shuts ] - Can I help you ? - Just getting my bearings . - Well , keep them out of my office . Right . Okay , I 've checked the summerhouse , the estate in Scotland and Bimini . - No one knows where your father is . - Larron . - Yes , Miss Parker ? - If she 's ever in my office again , I 'll kill you . Yes , Miss Parker . - What 's he doing out of his hole ? - We found something I thought - [ Whispers ] Outside . - I don 't want to talk in there . - I searched through my old record . I was in Europe during the missing time thatJarod was talking about ... - the precise dates . - So ? It was a pointless symposium that I was ordered to attend by Mr. Raines . All the weirdness around here is courtesy of Mr. Skin Grafts himself . Mr. Lyle shows up . Your father disappears . It 's too coincidental to be just a coincidence . Syd , how is it that half the time you bumble around here without a clue ... and the other half you 're a sage that knows everything ? - What 's that about ? - [ Door Shuts ] - Survival . - Oh , um , I , uh - I 'm gonna go back to my hole . First , you 're gonna help me find out exactly who Mr. Lyle is . [ Whispering ] And how do you expect me to do that ? - Who knows all the dirty secrets around here ? - Mr. Raines . Score one for Captain Kangaroo . While Raines is in the infirmary ... you 're gonna hack into his archives and search for any references to Mr. Lyle . - Are you crazy ? - And while you 're rifling through his archive ... find out what Raines was doing here while I was in Europe . - Oh , God ! - [ Pats Back ] - [ Pats Back ] - Come on . Where are your study partners ? Joel is trying to hold down lunch , and , uh , Chloe went to get some . [ Chuckles ] Day of the Dead calavera . I guess you did spend some time in Cuernavaca . - Yes . It 's a little hobby I picked up when I was there . - Were you teaching ? No , I was a monk . But I did learn a lot about the Day of the Dead , about respecting and remembering those who came before . Every year when we were little , my grandmother would take us to our parents ' grave ... and we 'd clean and decorate the grave with the calaveras that we would make . She 'd tell us stories about them - you know , connect us to our roots . - Did you ever do that at the graves of your relatives ? - No . I don 't know where they are . That 's why I want to find Enrique , so I can bury him properly . - You seem sure that he 's not alive . - The night that he disappeared ... he decided to skip the Halloween party and ... help me study for my premed exam . But he never made it home . Part of me died last Halloween . It was the part that was connected to my brother . - Some brothers don 't have that connection . - [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Bruno ] Nice place , if you 're tryin 'to raise the dead . I didn 't hear you knock . That 's funny . Neither did ... I. You know , most adults aren 't ... - into Halloween quite this much . - It 's research . Hey , I downloaded all the back issues of the newspaper like you asked . Now where is my paper ? I know it 's none of my business ... but why did you only want the obituaries for the last few years ? You 're right . It 's none of your business . Here 's some trick-or-treat candy . I 'm particularly fond of the black-and-orange kind . They 're very tasty . " The black-and-orange kind " ? You are from Bosnia . And I 'm way too old for trick-or-treating . Well , what do you do on Halloween ? Well , my favorite thing is to wrap dog poop in some newspaper ... put it on some old fart 's porch , set it on fire and run . - Why ? - Because they come out and stomp on it . Well , doesn 't that mess their shoes ? Oh . Oh ! Oh-ho-ho ! - [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ] That 's good ! - [ Jarod ] Good evening . - [ Gasps ] I 'm glad I caught you at work . I missed you in class today . I 'm a little worried about your study group . I 'm not sure you 're going to make it . Nah , don 't worry , Professor Howard . I 'm not gonna let ' em down . It 's not about you . It 's about Fernando . His brother couldn 't handle it , and I 'm not sure he can . I knew Enrique and I know Fernando . He 's a rock . So , it 's true . Enrique couldn 't take the pressure . I saw him crack up myself . I was helping Enrique recruit homeless men for one of Dr. Fein 's research projects . He had us search for this particular fellow named Broad Street Bill . But when I came in around 11 : 00 for the night shift ... Enrique started acting really strange . - He called Dr. Fein . - And after work he went home ? - He went out to do a burial first . - At 11 : 00 at night ? We do late burials here all the time . It saves money or something . [ Tapping Keyboard ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] Well , Marisa ... if you 're dead in my lab , then who 's buried in your grave ? [ Digging ] [ Grunts ] Oh , my God . Enrique . They buried you alive . [ Thunderclaps ] [ Grunting ] N-No ! No ! No ! [ Grunting , Yelping ] - [ Sydney ] You had the nightmare again . - So what was it ? Some kind of narcotics experiment ? A nerve-gas test ? Or just the M.R.I. from hell ? Whatever it was , Jarod , it was done without my knowledge . I 'd been sent to Europe during the missing time . [ Sighs ] I 'm doing everything I can to get you answers . - [ Thunderclaps Continue ] - You ever think about death , Sydney ? Not a day goes by where I don 't wonder if it could be my last . Are you ill ? [ Laughs ] I work at the Centre . There are unsettling changes here . - Then walk away . - My work here isn 't finished ... till you 're out of jeopardy ... - you and - - Jacob . We can 't forget our brothers , Sydney . In life ... or in death . [ Beeps Off ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] Oh , oh ! [ Laughing ] You were so quiet , I - You must get a lot of that around here . Oh , um , funny . Yeah . I was waiting for you . Your brother asked me to give you these vouchers for the cadavers . Oh , okay . Thanks . While I was waiting , Detective Keyes came by looking for you . - Detective Keyes ? - Mm-hmm . You know the one . She 's helping Fernando find his brother , Enrique . Oh , she asked me to give you this . It 's an exhumation order ... for a woman named Hall , Marisa Hall . It 's very interesting . Detective Keyes came by my lab today ... and she was fingerprinting cadavers . And there 's this pre-dissected cadaver from last year on my slab ... and I 'll be dammed if it isn 't the very same Marisa Hall . Who are you ? Someone who wants to know how many more of your customers ... Detective Keyes is going to find in my lab . And someone who wants to know why Enrique Ramos was buried alive in the grave that he dug . - Oh , no . - Yes . - Oh , no . - I dug him up myself . Unless you want to dig your grave any deeper , I suggest you tell me what he was doing there . Last Halloween , my brother brought in the body of a homeless man . He told me to cremate it . Enrique was working later that night ... and when he saw the body , he got really upset , and , uh , he called my brother . The next thing I know , my brother shows up looking for him . And I told him Enrique was , uh , digging a plot for the Hall woman . I just assumed he paid him to leave town . He wasn 't quite that lucky . [ Murmuring ] [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Can you believe they 've raised the price of snack food ? - Oh , uh - Oh - - No bother . It 's my job to clean up around here anyway . Name 's Brigitte . - [ Chuckles Weakly ] - Cat got your tongue , love ? Oh , no . It 's just that I - I thought that I was the only one who actually ate those things around here . You 've company now , Mr. Broots . - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - [ Chuckles Nervously ] Hmm . - Thank you . - By the way ... Mr. Raines isn 't in his office today . I really shouldn 't be doing this . Dr. Fein doesn 't let anybody into his lab . He gets really paranoid somebody 's gonna poach his data . Even when I brought him test subjects , they could only come in one at a time . - Like the homeless man you were telling me about . - Um , Broad Street Bill ? Yeah , yeah . In fact , Dr. Fein did several tests on him . - You haven 't seen him for almost a year , have you ? - No , I haven 't . And you never will . No one will . Raines had nothing at all on Mr. Lyle . It 's like - It 's like he didn 't exist . [ Miss Parker ] Then why are you wetting your pants ? Why ? Because of that Brigette . Rumor is she 's an assassin , and I know she saw me coming out of Mr. Raines 's office . And she called me " Mr. " Wh-What do you think she means by that ? Broots , forget Princess Ice and start the damn disc . [ Broots ] This disc is from Raines 's private archives . - [ Sydney ] My God , it 's Jarod . ! - It 's from the time you were in Europe . [ Grunting ] [ Sighs ] See ? Nothing special . Nothing at all . Let 's go . Let 's get out ofhere . Come on . - What 's in there ? - I don 't know . He never let me go any farther than here . [ Joel ] We really shouldn 't be doing this . [ Exhales Forcefully ] What the hell is that ? [ Muffled Cries ] No ! No ! No ! - Who 's that with Mr. Raines ? - [ Tapping Keyboard ] Mm ! Uh ! No ! [ Jarod Whimpering ] No ! No ! N-N-No ! No ! Uh ! " Cardio-benzine . " What ? It 's used to slow a patient 's heart rate - in large enough doses ... to stop it . Uh ! No ! [ Screaming ] Show me the gauges , Broots . - [ Tapping Keyboard ] - [ Whispers ] My God . Below freezing . - There . Stop it . - Wait . [ Tapping Keyboard ] - [ Broots ] Who-Who is that ? - Mr. Lyle . The freak gets around more than Ed McMahon . - Who is this guy ? - [ Whispers ] I don 't know . And that 's what scares me . [ Screaming ] " Adrenal cortisene . " Dr. Fein 's experimental blood pressure drug ? Experimental , yes . Blood pressure , no . He was using it to revive heart response . No ! [ Panting ] What did he - What 'd he need these for ? When it didn 't work . [ Sustained Beep ] Jarod 's flatlined . They were killing him . - [ Paddles Power Up ] - Clear ! [ Thumping ] - Clear ! - [ Thumping ] Clear ! That 's what they did to me . Do you think Dr. Fein was trying to kill his subjects ? He killed them all - for a minute or two anyway . And then he revived them . [ Whispers ] Broad Street Bill ? The one who didn 't come back . - [ Doorbell Rings ] - [ All ] Trick or treat ! Who wants Pez ? - [ Doorbell Rings ] - Trick or treat ! Here you go . [ Beeping ] Dr. Fein ? It 's Jarod . I 'm sorry to disturb you , but Sheldon was looking for you . Something about an exhumation order . Exhumation ? Did he say who ? Some woman named Hall . Do you want me to go down there ? A mix-up with the cadavers - Well , that could be very bad for the school . - No . No , uh , I 'll handle it . - Whatever you say , boss . [ Owl Hooting ] [ Grunting ] Ahh ! Oh ! - Trick or treat . - You scared the hell out of me . Well , that is , after all , what this holiday is all about . Isn 't it ? Oh , you 're too late . He 's gone . - Who 's gone ? - Enrique . You know , the young man you killed ? - What kind of sick prank are you trying to play ? - Oh , this isn 't a prank . It 's a life lesson . You know , in some cultures they believe ... that the spirit of a man killed in anger returns ... to exact revenge upon his perpetrator . Spooky , huh ? - I 'm gettin ' out of here . - Oh , no . You can 't leave . This is the Day of the Dead . And you , sir , are the special guest . Uh . ! Let me out ofhere , Jarod . ! This isn 't funny . ! I know . It would be awful to be buried alive ... especially with that on your shoe . [ Screaming ] Jarod . ! Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . There 's no reason to wake the dead . You 're gonna be joining them soon enough . Jarod , please ! Did Enrique discover you had killed one of the research subjects he recruited for you ? - You 're crazy . - Ah , ah , ah , now ! That is not a very nice thing to say to a man with a shovel ! Is it ? Will you let me out of here ? Let me out of here , Jarod , please ! You took an innocent , homeless man , and you turned him into your guinea pig . Someone to test your heart drug on . Someone that you didn 't think would be missed if it didn 't work . Well , it didn 't work , did it ? And someone did miss him : Enrique . So you buried him alive to save your research . Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Yes . Yes ! Now let me out of here ! Screaming isn 't gonna help you conserve your oxygen . And believe me , you 're going to need all you can get . - No ! No ! No , Jarod ! - Happy Halloween . Jarod . ! J - Jarod . ! Jarod . ! [ Screaming ] Jarod ! Jarod ! - Hey . - [ Knocking ] - J - Jarod . ! Jarod . ! Jarod . ! - Psst ! Wait 15 minutes , then call Detective Keyes . - Think he 's got enough air in there ? - Yeah . More than enough . - J - Jarod . ! - But he doesn 't need to know that . - Jarod . ! Jarod . ! - You know , Bosnia boy ... this is the best Halloween I ever had . - [ Knocking Continues ] - Jarod . ! J - Jarod ? Jarod . ! Jarod . ! Jarod . ! Jarod . ! Jarod . ! Jar - - Wow , C-minus , huh ? - Will you stop ? - I did not get a C-minus . - Yes , you did . C-minus . - I did not ! I think you got a C-minus . - Yes , very bad . Oh , yeah . [ Chloe ] Oh , you , my friend - [ Indistinct ] [ Machinery Humming , Beeping ] [ Labored Breathing ] You were expecting Florence Nightingale ? What do you want ? Answers ... the kind only you can give me . Your skin grafts are healing nicely . Hmm . - [ Guttural Gasping ] - Mm . Let 's not have another blowout , shall we ? Nobody 's going to hear us ... nobody can see us ... - and nobody is going to come save you . - [ Whimpers ] It 's just you ... and me . Now ... I want to know ... where my father is . - [ Whimpers ] - Where ... is ... - my ... father ? - Ahh . ! Oh . ! l-I don 't know . [ Groans ] - Is he dead ? - I don 't know . - [ Skin Tearing ] - [ Groaning ] Who ... is Mr. Lyle ? - Who is he ? - [ Groaning ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Pained Groan ] He 's the bogeyman . - [ Thunderclaps ] - [ Jarod ] They stopped my heart . - Why ? - [ Sydney ] I don 't know . Why does Mr. Raines do anything he does ? He wasn 't alone . The other man . Mr. Lyle . He 's here at the Centre now . I won 't let this go . I promise you that . Well , neither will I. - Will you be all right ? - I 'll survive ... even if it is the Day of the Dead . [ Sydney ] Halloween . Which I happen to be late for - trick-or-treating , you know . - Dressed as what ? - The scariest creature I can think of . [ Doorbell Rings ] [ Weakly ] Mm , eh , trick or treat .

 Welcome to The Falls . please enter your code now . Welcome to The Falls . please enter your code now . Welcome to The ... Welcome home , Mr KIine . Oops . Did you get some on you , Dave ? Didn 't want you to get fined . Just trying to be neighborly . Gotta be up to code . Shroeder 's out there painting our mailbox ! You know what I 'm gonna do ? I 'm gonna paint the whole damn house pink . Forget about the mailbox . I 'II make this place look like you won it selling cosmetics . How about that ? That 'II show these Nazis . Honey , would you just calm down ? Rules are rules . They 're repainting our mailbox because it 's Desert Sienna instead of Desert Sage . - This guy is a freakin ' weirdo . - Hon , what 's that package ? I don 't know . Doesn 't say who sent it . Whoa . Tasteful . Boy , the neighbors would really hate that . Honey ? What is it ? Stay here . Dave ? Honey ? Wow . Take a look at this . Honey , what do you think ? Is this place us or what ? You must be the Petries . Hi . Welcome . Welcome to The Falls . I 'm Rob . This is my lovely wife Laura . - Rob and Laura Petrie . - We pronounce it " Pee-tree , " actually . - Oh . - Like the dish . It 's so nice to meet you . I 'm Pat Verlander . I Iive six doors down . - I 'm the neighborhood welcome wagon . - pleased to meet you . I must say , it 's already ten after five . I don 't think you 're gonna make it . - I 'm sorry ? - The six o 'clock cutoff . AII move-ins have to be completed by 6pm . It 's in the CC and R 's . It 's one of our rules . Wow . The photos did not do it justice . Guys , fast . Come on . The previous owners left it so clean . What do you do for a living , Mr Pee-tree ? - That 's right , isn 't it ? - Yeah . I work mostly at home . Which is great for Laura because she gets me all to herself . This place really is immaculate . I 'd Iike to send a thank-you note to the previous owners . That 's sweet . Good . OK . Move , people . Come on . - Rob and Laura Petrie . - Pee-tree . - Win Shroeder , neighbor . Welcome . - Hi , Win . Nice to meet you . Don 't you folks worry . We 'II have you moved in before six . Time ? - 5 : 19 . - Pardon me , neighbor . - Excuse us . - Thanks . Oh , thank you . Thank you . Excuse me ! - I 'II get that . - No , don 't be silly . It 's heavy . I got it . Oh , man . I 'm so sorry . I 'm really sorry . Mike , Mike , Mike , it 's OK . It 's OK , Mike . Go help Gordy . Just send me any bills . I 'm sorry . I 'm Cami Shroeder , by the way . Win 's wife . Nice to meet you . I 'm Laura . - Where 's this go ? - You can put that in the driveway . Whoa , whoa ! Hold on , hold on . Let 's talk . A b-ball fan , huh ? Shootin ' hoops . That 's ... That 's not good . That 's gonna stand out in your front yard . - Stand out , Win ? - Not be aesthetically pleasing . To the eye . But maybe you can get special dispensation from Mr Gogolak , president of our homeowners association . Ask him . But in the meantime ... let 's keep that in the garage . Just put it in the garage . OK ! Let 's finish getting you folks moved in . Let 's go ! Let 's move ! Move ! Yeah , nothing weird going on around here . Hey , wait a minute . You didn 't let me carry you over the threshold . - You ready ? - Let 's get it on , honey . AII right , then . Thanks to our friendly neighbors , there will be no fluorescein bloodstain enhancement . Not that it makes much difference . This place is so clean , you can build computer chips . OK . 6 : 01pm , February 24th . Agents Scully and Mulder in the former home of David and Nancy KIine , who disappeared without a trace last July . The KIines were the third such couple to disappear since this neighborhood was built in 1991 . AII were apparently stable professional people with no history of violence , domestic discord or mental illness , and it took a family member or employee to realize that they were gone , including their cars and a few personal items . What local police found in each case was nothing , just impeccably manicured homes , and neighbors who professed total ignorance that anyone had disappeared . That 's surprising , considering how nutty this bunch is about being neighborly . The local police department were at a dead end , so they turned to the FBI . AD Skinner , in assigning us this case , thought a fruitful approach to the investigation would be if we went undercover posing as prospective homebuyers , as this planned community would seem to hide a dark , possibly murderous , conspiracy of silence . You wanna make that honeymoon video now ? - Rob and Laura Petrie ? - Pee-tree . If we ever go undercover again , I get to choose the names , OK ? Fine . - You 're not taking this seriously . - I just don 't understand why we 're on it . It 's our first catch back . This isn 't an X-File . Sure , it is . It 's unexplained . What do you want ? aliens ? Tractor beams ? Wow . Admit it . You just wanna play house . Woman , get back in here and make me a sandwich . Did I not make myself clear ? Hi . Well , you didn 't need to do that . please . I have more dishes than I need . I just usually use one and then wash it . - I 'm Mike Raskub , by the way . - Hi . Big Mike , for obvious reasons . I Iive the next street over . That 's a caduceus . - Are you a doctor , Mike ? - No , a vet . Veterinarian . If you folks are thinking about getting a dog , or any pet , I 'II check it out for you . No charge . Just ... you 're not allowed to have over 16 pounds of pet . It 's one of the CC and R 's . Mighty nice of you , Mike . Gosh , with all this hospitality , I can 't believe the KIines ever left . That was their name , wasn 't it ? The KIines ? I have to go . - Mulder . - The name is Rob . What you got there ? Looks like whoever cleaned this place maybe missed a spot . That look like blood to you ? How 'd it get way up there ? I didn 't really learn much about them . He just said he works at home - which tells me she 's got money . Seemed nice . Cute couple . Very cute . They 're a nice couple . What do you think , Gene ? Ladies , my compliments to the chef . Cami , Sissy ? These Petries , are they gonna play ball ? Pee-trees . So far so good . I 'm keeping my eye on them . Mr Gogolak ... Don 't you think that maybe this time it would be better if we told them ? Mike , you and I have been through this before . - We don 't know yet if we can trust them . - It 's just that ... There are so many ... so many rules . I think that maybe they would be able to keep up with them better if they knew what happened if they don 't . It 's the neighborly thing to do . I really think we should do this . Son , Godspeed . Thank you . - Can I use your ... ? - Second door to the Ieft . There 's glade under the sink . Gordy , how about you go make sure he finds it ? Gene , I can talk him out of this . Win , the boy 's a weak link , and a strong chain can 't survive with a weak link . .. is instinctive and necessary for survival . Failure to conform within the tribal structure can often prove lethal . When group elders suspect such an outcast within their midst , tribal members gather in a circle to perform a ritual chant in the belief that this will expose the unwitting conduit ... Oh , no . No . No ! I fixed it ! I fixed it ! Morning . Oh ! Rob , Laura , I 'm so sorry . So , good morning . How was your first night ? Peaceful ? It was wonderful . We spooned up and fell asleep like little baby cats . - Isn 't that right , honeybunch ? - Right , poopyhead . Are we in the right place ? Is this Big Mike 's house ? Yeah , yeah . I 'm just helping out . Mike had to leave town on business . What kind of business ? I thought he was a veterinarian . Veterinarian business , I guess . I just know he 's gone weeks at a time . - I 'II just leave this here , then . - Let me take those . Just tidier-Iooking than leaving them on the front porch . - It would be more aesthetically pleasing . - Exactly . Would you two like to join us for dinner this evening , about six ? We eat early . - That sounds great . Thanks . - Great . Oh , Win ? You mentioned that I could talk to someone about putting up my basketball hoop . Who was that again ? Mr Gogolak , was it ? AII right , then , Iet 's see . Basketball hoop and backboard , portable . Nope , I 'm sorry . It 's not allowed . - You 're kidding . - I 'm afraid not . Rules are rules . It may not sound like anything - a basketball hoop . But it 's just a few short steps to spinning daisy reflectors and a bass boat in the driveway . In other words , anarchy . It may sound tough , but ours is a system that works . It 's why The Falls is one of the top-ranked planned communities in all of California . Most of our homeowners have been here since day one . I Iove the decor here , Mr Gogolak . Is it Occidental ? It 's Nepalese and Tibetan , mostly . I go there twice a year on business . I run Pier 9 Imports . I can get you a great deal on rattan furniture . Indoor only . Outdoor use is prohibited by our CC and R 's . Uh-uh , Scruffy . Go on , now . Uh-uh , Scruffy . Go on , now . Sweetheart ? Did you use the dolphin-safe tuna ? - Dolphin-safe all the way . - We always use dolphin-safe . You gotta love those dolphins . although they 're pretty tasty , too . So , where 'd you two meet ? - Actually , it was at a UFO conference . - flying saucers ? Interesting . Wouldn 't have thought you folks would 've been into that . It 's not me so much as Laura . She 's quite the New Ager . She 's into those magnetic bracelets and crystals and mood rings . God bless her . She 's a sucker for all that stuff . I wouldn 't have guessed that . Would you ? - No kidding ? - Yeah . You know , when you told me this morning that Big Mike was out of town on business , I don 't think that 's true . You don 't ? No . Cos we called his office , didn 't we ? - We did . - Yeah . We 're thinking of getting a dog . So we wanted to call him and ask his advice . - See if his office had a forwarding number . - They didn 't know where he was . Do you know where he is , Win ? I really couldn 't tell you . It 's gotta be something freaky for him to lie about it . Maybe he 's got some wild secret life . But every community has its dark underbelly , don 't you think ? We don 't have any underbelly . As far as I 'm concerned , this community is the American Dream . I 'm sorry . I realized that it 's past time that I walk Scruffy . - Would you Iike some company ? - Yeah . So , is this the American Dream ? This place ? Nice neighborhood . You know . It 's a Iot of people who want the best for their families . So it 's just not your dream . You know , Cami , I 've noticed that you 've walked us past Mike 's house twice . - Are you worried about him ? - No . I don 't really know what you mean . Scruffy ! Scruffy , come here ! Scruffy , no ! Scruffy ! Scruffy , come out here ! Scruffy . Scruffy , come out of there . - Let me take a look . - Do you see him ? Scruffy , it 's OK , it 's OK . I got you . I got you . What you got there ? Deep breath . That was a close one , huh ? That 's a good boy . Let me wipe that off . That 's a good boy . OK , Iet 's get you home . Come on . - AII right , Lieutenant . - Keys . Thank you . Thank you . Local PD came up blank on ... Mike Raskub . No activity on his credit cards , no sighting of his ' 97 Mercury Villager . There 's no sign of him in his house . I didn 't see him in the storm drain , either . - I 'd take it he 's dead , Scully . - " Laura . " - You think it 's Win Shroeder ? - Maybe Win cleaning up . cleaning up for who ? Speaking of cleaning up , who taught you how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste ? What do we know about this stuff ? I 'm driving down to San Diego tomorrow to have it analyzed . Third warning : toilet seat . Why kill Big Mike ? What 's missing here is intent . What would be the motive ? Compulsive neatness , or lack thereof ? Have you noticed how everybody here is obsessed with the neighborhood rules ? - You know what ? You fit in really well here . - And you don 't . Anyway , tomorrow I got a surefire way of testing out my theory . Come on , Laura . You know ... We 're married now . " Scully , " Mulder . Good night . The thrill is gone . Bring it on . - Stay here . - Stop him , Win . Stop him ! Hey , Win . Wanna play horse ? - What the hell are you doing ? - What am I doing ? - What are you doing ? - Damn it ! Help me get it inside . - What 's gonna happen if we don 't ? - Fine . That 's the way you want it ? - You were warned . - Warned about what ? No ! No ! No ! No ! Stop ! Cami , are you all right ? Mulder ? Mulder , is that you ? Sorry , Mulder . - Somebody was in the house . - Tidying up . They put away my basketball hoop . Somebody 's looking after us , which may not be bad . - What do you mean ? - I saw what 's been scaring everybody . I take it back . This is an X-File . How 's Cami ? What did we do wrong , Gene ? Was our welcome mat not to your liking ? Did I coil my garden hose clockwise instead of counterclockwise ? Hold the phone now . Are you saying I had something to do with this ? Who else ? The exact same thing . The thing you had me do to Mike . - Who else would do that ? - Son , you 'II wanna take a deep breath and rethink that theory . It 's your next-door neighbor , Win . He 's a rabble-rouser . He 's trouble with a capital T. And you and I both know it only takes one rotten apple to spoil the whole bunch . Here we go . Yeah . I 'm guessing there 's one of these in every yard . I think this is how this thing travels , where it lives . In the ground ? This huge creature you think you saw ? Look , Mulder , huge creatures aside , do you care to hear what I think ? always . These are the lab results from the San Diego PD . The stuff that we found on the fan blade - the dried blood and scalp hairs ? It 's neither . The blood is predominantly ketchup and brake fluid , and the hairs are bristles from a scrub brush . And the same goes for the sample we found on the dog 's muzzle . It 's coffee grounds , eggshells and motor oil , with about 50 other constituents , with a Iittle Mercurochrome for color . In other words , Mulder , it 's garbage , which makes perfect sense , because this entire neighborhood was built upon an old landfill . - A landfill ? - Mm-hm . We found this stuff because it 's everywhere . It 's just beneath the topsoil . And that protrusion in the front yard may occur from the venting of methane gas . I don 't see how any of this has to do with the disappearances . It does . Somehow it 's one and the same . The KIines ? - Yeah ? - What if they 're still here ? You mean , buried in the yard ? Once we start a forensic excavation , our cover 's blown . Once we start a forensic excavation , our cover 's blown . What in God 's name are you doing ? - Putting in a pool . - In the front yard ? What are you , insane ? Have you looked at the CC and R 's ? You can 't put in a swimming pool ! It 's not a swimming pool . It 's a reflecting pool . I checked the rules . There 's no rule against putting in a reflecting pool . It 's very tranquil . You 'II like it . Let him dig his own grave . Hey . Mulder . Hey . Mulder . The KIines aren 't down there . I think it 's time you called it a night . Tasteful , isn 't it ? Gogolak . Hey , can you get an excavation team out here ? - Yeah . - We need to dig deeper . - Where are you going ? - To price some rattan furniture . This is Special Agent Dana Scully . I need a full forensic team to 450 Autumn Terrace . No , not tomorrow . Tonight . I 'm sorry . Can I call you back ? Oh , God . It 's come for you , Laura . You can 't make a noise . Mike . What happened to you ? - You have to get out of here . - Why ? Who 's downstairs ? Mike ? - Who did this to you ? - The Ubermenscher . It 's our fault . The original homeowners . We asked for it . - Now we can 't stop it . - Stop what , Mike ? I tried to give it Shroeder . You know , tit for tat , just like Shroeder did for me . Mike , listen . Settle down . Just give me my gun . I 'm a federal agent . The Ubermenscher wants you . Your husband has broken way too many rules . I 've been hiding in the sewer . I tried to warn him . Just give me the gun . - FBI ? What did I do ? - Let 's start with the KIines . You 're responsible for them being in little pieces in my yard . You gave them that lawn ornament . - Whirligig . - Yeah . It 's tacky enough to break your rules , tacky enough to mark the KIines for death . And won 't that sound good in a court of law ? When the judge asks you who killed the KIines , what exactly will you tell him ? A tulpa . It 's a Tibetan thought form . It 's a living creature willed into existence by someone who possesses that ability , an ability I think you picked up on your whirligig-buying excursions to the Far East . Why 'd you do it ? Is it so damn important for everybody to have the same color mailbox ? It 's important that people fit in . You didn 't know what you were getting into , did you ? You can summon its existence , you can give it life , but you can 't control it . AII you can do is stay out of its way . Son , my lawyers are gonna make you sound so stupid that not only will I never see the inside of a jail cell , but you 'II be signing all your paychecks straight to me . Gene ? Win . You 've got two FBI agents living next-door to you . Cheer up . It 's not for long . Scully ? Scully ! Scully ? Mulder ? - Scully ? - Mulder . Scully , hang on . Come here and help me with this . Win , come here . Win ! Win , wait a minute . No , no . He deserves what he gets . Mulder , it was here . Mulder ! Several residents have come forward to blame neighborhood deaths on homeowner-association president Gene Gogolak . These residents deny Agent Mulder 's allegation that they were in some sense all responsible for the demise of Gogolak himself , claiming ignorance as to what actually killed him . The code of silence that hid the sins of this community has not only survived but , in its creator , claimed a final victim . Meanwhile , The Falls at Arcadia has been named one of the top planned communities in California for the sixth year running . Visiontext Subtitles : Tram Nguyen Zelniker US ENGLISH

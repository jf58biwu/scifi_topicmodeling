I MEAN , I TRY TO BE A GOOD GUY TO WORK FOR . YOU MENTIONED ANOTHER INCIDENT WITH ANOTHER EMPLOYEE ... AT A PLANT IN KANSAS CITY IN 1994 ? - YES . - WERE YOU AT THAT PLANT AT THAT TIME ?

UH , NO , MR. PINCUS . THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? I DON 'T KNOW . [ Door Opens ] - MULDER , WHY DIDN 'T YOU TAKE THE DAY OFF ? - CLOSE THE DOOR . THERE WAS A REASON THE PHRASE " HIDING IN THE LIGHT " SEEMED SO FAMILIAR TO ME . I FOUND IT OR VARIATIONS OF IT IN FIVE OTHER X-FILES . " HIDING IN PLAIN VIEW , " " HIDING IN THE OPEN , " " LURKING IN THE OPEN " - - ALL TO DESCRIBE SOME MANIFESTATION OF EVIL ... WHICH GOES UNNOTICED BY EVERYONE EXCEPT THE CLAIMANT IN EACH CASE . HAVE YOU SLEPT ? SEVEN CITIES IN ALL , DATING BACK TEN YEARS . VINYLRIGHT HAS OFFICES WITHIN 50 MILES OF FOUR OF THOSE CITIES . GREG PINCUS HAS WORKED FOR VINYLRIGHT FOR GUESS FOR HOW LONG ? TEN YEARS . WHAT EXACTLY IS IT THAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE HERE ? WHAT IF GARY LAMBERT WAS RIGHT ? - MULDER , YOU 'RE NOT SERIOUS . - JUST BEAR WITH ME FOR A MOMENT . I MEAN , WHAT IF SUCH A CREATURE EXISTED THAT COULD CAMOUFLAGE ITSELF ... BY CLOUDING THE MINDS OF ITS VICTIMS ? THERE ARE ANTECEDENTS FOR IT IN NATURE RIGHT IN THE INSECT WORLD . MANTIS , FOR INSTANCE . THEY 'RE SAID TO BE ABLE TO HYPNOTIZE THEIR PREY . NO . WHAT IF IT COULD INDUCE A VISUAL HALLUCINATION ? A SORT OF TEMPORARY CONVERSION DISORDER ? WHAT YOU 'RE DESCRIBING WOULD BE MORE LIKE SOME KIND OF ... VISUAL AGNOSIA , AN INABILITY TO RECOGNIZE WHAT 'S BEFORE ONE 'S EYES . ONLY GARY LAMBERT COULD SEE THROUGH IT SOMEHOW , AS COULD THE OTHERS . MAYBE BECAUSE OF SOME HEIGHTENED ADRENALINE LEVEL , OR MAYBE JUST BECAUSE HE KNEW WHERE TO LOOK SOMEHOW . MULDER , HE WAS DISTURBED . YEAH , BUT DID HE SEE IT BECAUSE HE WAS DISTURBED , OR WAS HE DISTURBED BECAUSE HE SAW IT ? HE WAS MENTALLY ILL . THIS MONSTER WAS A- - WAS A SICK FANTASY , A PRODUCT OF HIS DEMENTIA . I SAW IT TOO . DOES THAT MAKE ME DISTURBED ? DEMENTED ? DOES THAT MAKE ME SICK TOO ? NO . NO , I MEAN , THIS KIND OF THING IS NOT UNCOMMON . YOU- - YOU WENT THROUGH A TERRIBLE ORDEAL . AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE IN CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS ... UNDER TENSE CONDITIONS CAN- - THE DELUSIONS OF ONE CAN BE PASSED ON TO THE OTHER . FOLIE A DEUX ? IT 'S NOT THAT , SCULLY . IT 'S NOT HELSINKI SYNDROME EITHER . WHAT I SAW WAS REAL , AND THERE MAY BE A WAY TO PROVE IT . HOW ? LAMBERT POINTED OUT CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS HE SAID HAD BEEN VICTIMIZED BY PINCUS . TURNED INTO ZOMBIES . THE MAN HE SHOT , BACKUS , WAS ONE OF THEM . IF YOU COULD AUTOPSY THE BODY- - NO . NO , ABSOLUTELY NOT . SCULLY , IF THIS IS ALL IN MY MIND , AS YOU SAY IT IS , I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD PROVE THAT . MULDER , I AM NOT GOING TO SERVE THE DELUSIONS OF GARY LAMBERT , A MADMAN , BY GIVING CREDENCE TO THEM . THEN I 'LL PROVE IT WITHOUT YOU . MULDER- - [ Rice ] WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR ? I 'LL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT . WHAT 'S THIS ABOUT ? LAMBERT WAS TRACKING HIS BOSS 'S MOVEMENTS OVER THE YEARS . STALKING HIM . GATHERING EVIDENCE . WHAT IS IT ? DID YOU SEE HER ? DID YOU SEE WHERE SHE WENT ? WHO ? YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE ? [ Car Engine Starting ] SIR ? YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ? YES , I WAS HOPING YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT INTO AGENT MULDER 'S RECENT BEHAVIOR . SIR ? WHY IS HE BACK IN ILLINOIS ? I THOUGHT THAT CASE WAS CLOSED . AGENT MULDER BELIEVES THAT THERE MAY BE A CONNECTION ... BETWEEN THE OAK BROOK INCIDENT AND SEVERAL OTHER CASES . BUT YOU ELECTED NOT TO JOIN HIM . THE CHICAGO FIELD OFFICE HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH HIM . THEY DESCRIBE HIS BEHAVIOR AS BEING ERRATIC . TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE , AGENT MULDER IS CURRENTLY WORKING ... ON A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION . I WILL JOIN HIM IN ILLINOIS IMMEDIATELY . DON 'T YOU HAVE AN AUTOPSY TO DO FIRST ? THIS BODY MULDER SENT TO QUANTICO . MARK BACKUS , THE SHOOTING VICTIM . YOU 'RE SCHEDULED TO DO AN EXAMINATION . - OR DIDN 'T YOU KNOW THAT ? - I 'LL GET RIGHT ON IT , SIR . IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME , SCULLY ? NO , SIR . [ Door Opens , Shuts ] [ Scully ] LET 'S START WITH THE PHOTOS . IN FACT , LET 'S JUST DO PHOTOS . EXTERNAL EXAM ONLY . THIS GUY CAME AN AWFUL LONG WAY JUST TO HAVE HIS PICTURE TAKEN . KNOCK YOURSELF OUT . CASE NUMBER 986522 . MARK BACKUS , 45-YEAR-OLD CAUCASIAN MALE . [ Ringing ] THERE ARE THREE ONE-CENTIMETER GUNSHOT ENTRY WOUNDS ... ON THE LEFT ANTERIOR CHEST WALL ... - WITH SOME BURN STIPPLING PRESENT . - COME ON , MULDER . JUDGING FROM THE CORPSE 'S RESOLVED RIGOR AND FIXED LIVIDITY , AS WELL AS THE DECOMPOSITIONAL BLOATING , I 'D PLACE THE TIME OF DEATH BETWEEN 48 AND 72 HOURS . NO . THIS MAN DIED LATE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON . ARE YOU SURE ? ABSOLUTELY . IT SURE LOOKS TO ME LIKE HE 'S BEEN DEAD LONGER THAN THAT . [ Man On TV , Indistinct ] dddd [ Man Singing ] [ Fluttering ] [ Woman Screams ] [ Girl On TV ] I WANT TO DO THAT TOO . [ People On TV Continue , Indistinct ] [ Clattering ] SUDDENLY I BECAME AWARE OF THIS ... PRESENCE . AND I COULD FEEL IT CREEPING TOWARD ME . IT WAS TERRIFYING . THE NEXT THING I KNEW , THIS MADMAN 'S INSIDE MY HOUSE . HE BREAKS MY WINDOW , KICKS IN THE DOOR , AND THE WHOLE TIME HE 'S SCREAMING ABOUT MONSTERS- - I MEAN , EVEN WORSE THAN GARY . MISS STARNS , I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS INCIDENT . I ASSURE YOU IT WILL RECEIVE MY UTMOST ATTENTION . WHY DON 'T YOU TAKE THE REST OF THE WEEK , GRETCHEN ? THANK YOU , MR. PINCUS . THAT MAN HAS NO BUSINESS CARRYING A GUN , IF YOU ASK ME . - YOU GOT TO HER , TOO , DIDN 'T YOU ? - AGENT MULDER- - I WAS TOO LATE . YOU CHANGED HER SOMEHOW . YOU INFECTED HER . AGENT MULDER , THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE NEXT WORDS THAT COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH . ONCE AGAIN , I APOLOGIZE . OH , THERE 'S NO NEED . I 'M WELL AWARE OF THE STRESS AGENT MULDER 'S BEEN UNDER , AND I 'M , UH- - WELL , I STILL CONSIDER HIM A HERO . WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO HANDLE THIS PRIVATELY . WE APPRECIATE THAT . FOR MY PART , I 'M HAPPY TO LET THIS ENTIRE MATTER DROP . I 'M SURE I CAN PERSUADE MISS STARNS TO DO THE SAME , PROVIDED AGENT MULDER IS AMENABLE . YOU DON 'T SEE WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE . I 'M AFRAID I DO . LAMBERT KNEW YOUR SECRET . HE KNEW YOU WERE SUCKING THE HUMANITY ... OUT OF THESE PEOPLE , FEEDING ON THEM . AGENT MULDER , THAT 'S ENOUGH . I DON 'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER WORD OUT OF YOU . IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CAREER , THEN YOU 'LL KNOCK THIS CRAP OFF . [ Creaking ] BECAUSE I GUARANTEE I WILL NOT STAND FOR ANOTHER SECOND OF THIS ABUSE . DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME- - [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Creaking Continues ] GET OUT OF THE WAY ! GET OUT OF HERE ! NO ! STOP IT ! LOOK AT HIM ! LOOK AT HIM ! [ Shouts ] STOP IT . [ Mulder ] FIVE YEARS TOGETHER , SCULLY . YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THIS COMING . DID YOU EXAMINE BACKUS 'S BODY ? WHAT DID YOU FIND ? MORE OR LESS WHAT WE THOUGHT WE 'D FIND . MORE OR LESS ? WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN ? THE BODY SHOWED SIGNS OF DECOMPOSITION BEYOND WHAT WE EXPECTED TO FIND . WHICH IN AND OF ITSELF MEANS NOTHING , REALLY . TIME OF DEATH IS NOTORIOUSLY HARD TO QUANTIFY . OR THAT LAMBERT WAS TELLING THE TRUTH , AND THAT MAN WAS DEAD BEFORE HE WAS GUNNED DOWN . NO , MULDER . SCULLY , WHEN THAT MONSTER , PINCUS , WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT TO CALL IT , WHEN HE ATTACKED THAT WOMAN LAST NIGHT , HE DID SOMETHING TO THE BACK OF HER NECK . HE BIT HER THERE , OR HE INJECTED SOMETHING IN THERE . THERE 'S GOT TO BE EVIDENCE OF THAT . YOU GOTTA CHECK FOR THAT . MULDER , THE CASE IS OVER . THERE 'S NO MORE EVIDENCE TO BE GATHERED . THERE 'S ONLY MY HOPE THAT YOU 'LL BE ABLE TO SEE PAST THIS DELUSION . YOU ... HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SEE . I WISH IT WERE THAT SIMPLE . SCULLY , YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME . NOBODY ELSE ON THIS WHOLE DAMN PLANET DOES OR EVER WILL . YOU 'RE MY ONE IN FIVE BILLION . WELL , YOU JUST MADE IT . I WAS ABOUT TO SHIP HIM . [ Zipper Unzips ] FULL AUTOPSY THIS TIME ? NO .

[ Mulder Screaming ] HELP ! - HELP ! - [ Creature Screeching ] [ Skinner ] AGENT SCULLY , I HAVE TO SAY I 'M AT A BIT OF A LOSS HERE . DO I INFER CORRECTLY FROM THIS THAT YOU BELIEVE THERE 'S SOME ... MERIT TO AGENT MULDER 'S CLAIMS ? I BELIEVE THAT AGENT MULDER IS MENTALLY SOUND ... AND FIT FOR DUTY . ASIDE FROM THAT BELIEF , I CAN ONLY PRESENT TO YOU ... THE FEW HARD FACTS THAT I 'VE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER- - THAT , AS PER AGENT MULDER 'S ASSERTIONS , A TOXIN HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE BEEN INJECTED INTO THE SPINE ... OF THE SHOOTING VICTIM , MARK BACKUS . AS OF YET , WE 'VE BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY IT . FURTHERMORE , GREGORY PINCUS HAS APPARENTLY DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE , ALONG WITH HALF A DOZEN OTHER KEY WITNESSES ... INTEGRAL TO THIS INVESTIGATION , AMONG THEM AGENT MULDER 'S NURSE AT THE HOSPITAL ... AND SEVERAL OF VINYLRIGHT EMPLOYEES . MEN AND WOMEN DESCRIBED BY MULDER AS ZOMBIES . [ Sighs ] I PERSONALLY CAN VOUCH FOR THE FACT THAT ... THERE WAS AN INTRUDER IN AGENT MULDER 'S HOSPITAL ROOM . DESCRIBE THIS INTRUDER . IT WAS DARK . YOU MUST 'VE GOTTEN A GLIMPSE .

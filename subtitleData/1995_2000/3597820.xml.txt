 Help ! [ Grunts ] Help ! Somebody help me ! Help ! [ Panting ] Oh , he 's gonna kill me ! Help ! God , somebody help me ! Go away ! [ Screams ] Help ! [ Screams ] [ Panting ] Please help me ! [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] help ! Mulder ? Look at that . Huh ? Huh ? Oh , shi- - [ Door closes ] [ Tapping pen rhythmically ] Mulder- - Don 't . Don 't even start with me . I know what I saw . [ Sighs ] Skinner wants a report in one hour . What are you going to tell him ? I 'm gonna tell him exactly what I saw . What are you gonna tell him ? I 'll tell him exactly what I saw . Now , how is that different ? I 'm the one who may wind up going to prison here . I gotta know if you 're gonna back me up . First of all , If the family of Ronnie Strickland does , indeed , decide to sue the F.B.I ... For- - I think the figure is $ 446 million- - Then you and I both will most certainly be codefendants . And second of all- - I don 't even have a second of all , Mulder . Four hundred and forty-Six million dollars . I 'm in this as deep as you are , and I 'm not even the one that overreacted . I didn 't do the- - With the thing . I did not overreact . Ronnie Strickland was a vampire . Where 's your proof ? You 're my proof . You were there . Now you 're scaring me . I want to hear what you 're gonna tell Skinner . You want our stories straight . I didn 't say that . I just want to hear it the way you saw it . I don 't feel comfortable with that . Prison , Scully . Your cell mate 's nickname is gonna be " large Marge . " She 's gonna read a lot of Gertrude Stein . - All right . - All right , start at the beginning . The very beginning ? [ Drawer opens ] Fine . [ Sighs ] Yesterday morning ... When I arrived at work , You were , uh ... characteristically exuberant . Hope you brought your cowboy boots ! You want us to go to Dallas ? Yee-Haw ! Actually a town called Cheney about 50 miles south of there . Population : 361 . By all accounts , very rustic and charming . But as of late , ground zero , the locus ... For a series of mysterious nocturnal exsanguinations . Exsanguinations . Of whom ? [ Slides clicking into place ] [ Mulder ] how does that grab ya ? - It 's a- - - Dead cow ! Exactly . Or more specifically , a dead 900-Pound Holstein . Its body completely drained of blood , as was this one , This one , this one , this one , and so on- - Six , all in all- - Approximately one a week over the past six weeks . - Any sign of- - - Two small puncture wounds on the neck ? - Not what I was gonna ask . - Too bad . We got ' em . Check it out . These may be syringe marks , their placement meant to emulate fangs . Such ritualistic bloodletting points towards cultists of some sort , In which case- - What ? Yeah , that 's probably it . Satanic cultists . Come on , Scully . You 're not gonna tell me this is that Mexican goat sucker . El chupacabra ? They got four fangs , not two . - And they suck goats , hence the name . - So instead this would be ? - Classic vampirism . - Of a bunch of cows ? And one dead human . Last night a vacationer from new jersey . Come on . We gotta go . Why didn 't you tell me that from the beginning ? Lock the door on your way out . [ Disgusted sigh ] [ Scully 's voice ] the town of Cheney is too small to maintain a morgue facility . As such , we made our way to the peaceful slumbers funeral home ... In order to examine the body of one Mr. Dwight Funt , Recently deceased . [ Man talking quietly ] [ Scully ] it was there that we were met by a representative ... Of local law enforcement , Sheriff- - Lucius Hartwell . - You the F.B.I. Agents ? - Yes . I 'm- - Agents Mulder and , uh- - [ Snapping fingers ] Scully . What do you say we take a look at your victim ? Yeah , by all means . After you . Come on , Scully . Get those little legs moving ' . Come on . Boy . Here we go . Nice threads . No exam has been done ? No , ma 'am . He 's just like we found him in the motel room . Once I heard you folks were interested , I figured we 'd best leave it up to the experts . Your satanic cultists have some sharp little teeth . What satanic cultists ? Go ahead , tell him your , uh , " theory . " Well , my theory has evolved . Basically , I think we 're looking for someone who has seen one too many Bela Lugosi movies . He believes he is a vampire , therefore he- - They act like one . Yeah . Yeah . That makes a whole lot of sense . - I think she 's right . - What about the fang marks ? Well , someone so obsessed might well file down their incisors . I think that a moulage casting should help us make an identification . Moulage casting . That 's a good idea . Now- - Now , isn 't there some kind of disease that makes a person think that they 're a vampire ? Well , there is a psychological fixation called hematodipsia , Which causes the sufferer to gain erotic satisfaction ... From consuming human blood . Erotic . Yeah . There are also genetic afflictions ... Which cause a heightened sensitivity to light , Uh , to garlic . Porphyria . Xeroderma pigmentosum . You really know your stuff , Dana . " Dana " ? He never even knew your first name . - You gonna interrupt me , or what ? - No , go ahead . Dana . Anyway , That 's when you had your big breakthrough- - Whatever . Agent Scully , you really know your stuff . Sheriff , you say this man is exactly as you found him ? Yes , sir , to the letter . Have you noticed that this man 's shoes are untied ? - Yeah , they sure are . - Mulder , what 's your point ? This means something . Do you have an old cemetery in town , off the beaten path , the creepier the better ? Uh , yeah . - Take me there now . - Mulder . We 're gonna need a complete autopsy on this man , the sooner the better . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What am I even looking for ? I don 't know . - He does that . - Come on , sheriff Hartwell . Ma 'am . 4 : 54 p.m. Begin autopsy on white male , age 60 , Who is arguably having a worse time in Texas than I am , Although not by much . I 'll begin with the " y " incision . [ Blade hits floor ] Yee-Haw . Heart weighs 370 grams . Tissue appears healthy . Left lung weighs 345 grams . Tissue appears healthy . Large intestine , 890 grams . Yada , yada , yada . Stomach contents show last meal close to the time of death ... Consisting of ... Pizza , Topped with pepperoni , Green peppers , Mushrooms . Mushrooms . [ Sighs ] that sounds really good . [ Neck muscles cracking ] [ sighs ] [ Scully 's voice ] having completed the autopsy , I checked into the Davey Crockett motor court . [ Mulder ] the name of it was actually the Sam Houston Motor Lodge . [ Bed motor humming ] [ sighs ] [ Whispering ] oh , my God . [ Door hinges creak , door slams ] Chloral hydrate . What ? - What the hell happened to you ? - Nothin ' . Chloral hydrate ? Yeah , that thing that you didn 't know that you were looking for . Chloral hydrate , more colorfully known as " knockout drops . " I found it in abundance when I sent the tox screen in on our murder victim . - No , seriously , Mulder . What happened to you ? - Nothing . - Who slipped him the Mickey ? - My " theory " ? Your vampire . He found it necessary to dope poor Mr. Funt to the gills ... Before he was able to extract his blood . Probably did it to the cows too . What kind of vampire would do that ? Exactly . [ Sighs ] We got another dead tourist . You gotta do another autopsy . Tonight ? I just put money in the magic fingers . I won 't let it go to waste . [ Bed continues vibrating ] [ Sighs ] [ Giggling ] [ Giggling continues ] This one 's my room , Mulder . Don 't get mud everywhere . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay . [ Giggling ] Excuse me , ma 'am . Did you order a pizza ? Yeah . The guy in there will pay for it . [ Scully 's voice ] forgoing both dinner and sleep , I was soon back at the funeral home ... Examining one Mr. Paul Lombardo ... From Naples , Florida . Heart . Lung . Large intestine . [ Sighs ] [ Sighs deeply ] As with the previous victim , it appears that the subject ... Was most likely incapacitated with chloral hydrate ... And then exsanguinated . [ Phone rings ] [ sighs ] The drug was either injected or ingested , [ Ringing continues ] I 'm not sure which . [ Phone beeps ] Scully . [ Heavy breathing ] hello ? [ Gasping ] hello ? [ Panting ] [ Sighs ] where was I ? Stomach contents . [ Sighs ] Stomach contents include ... Pizza- - [ Gasps ] chloral hydrate 's in the pizza . The pizza guy . [ Gasps ] Mulder . Mulder ? [ Hissing ] That 's it ? Well , luckily , I 'd gotten there in time . I mean , though you were drugged , You were , more or less , unharmed . Mulder ? Are you okay ? Who 's the black private dick who 's the sex machine with all the chicks ? ? Shaft ? Can you dig it ? They say this cat shaft is a bad mother- - Shut your mouth . Talkin ' ' bout shaft . I did not . Long story short , Though my first four shots obviously missed Ronnie Strickland entirely , With my fifth , I was able to shoot out a tire on his car , Forcing him to escape on foot . I left you behind , and I entered the woods in pursuit . I assumed that you were incapacitated . Then I heard screaming . When I arrived in the clearing , I found that you had caught up with him first ... And had ... overreacted , And that his vampire teeth were fake . That 's what you 're gonna tell Skinner . Well , I 'm gonna argue that we caught a killer . An utterly non - Supernatural killer , but a killer nonetheless . And that your zeal to catch up with him was augmented ... By the chloral hydrate you were given . - You are afraid to tell the truth . - Excuse me ? That 's not the way it happened . Are you afraid if you tell it ... The way it really happened , you 'll look like an idiot , like me ? Mulder , why don 't you tell me the way you think it happened ? Starting at the beginning . You 're damn right . Yesterday morning began like any other morning . You arrived at the office characteristically less than exuberant . [ Quiet tone ] I hope you brought your cowboy boots . Why are we going to Dallas ? Actually it 's a little town just south of there called Cheney , Texas . They 've had incidents down there recently which I think you 'll agree are pretty unusual . - Like what ? - I brought some slides with which to better illustrate . Here we go . It 's a dead cow . It 's actually six dead cows , and here 's the really interesting thing . Why am I looking at six dead cows ? Because of the manner in which they died . All six were mysteriously exsanguinated . - And ? - And two little puncture marks right here on the neck . Look , I got a slide of that . And , um , one dead human victim . Last night a vacationer from new jersey . His body completely drained of blood , and two little puncture wounds on his neck . Okay , look , Scully , I don 't want to jump to any hasty conclusions , But on the strength of the evidence that we have here , I think what we may be looking at is what appears to be a series of vampire ... Or vampire-Like attacks . On what do you base that ? Uh , well , on the corpses drained of blood ... And the fang marks on the neck . But as always , I-I 'm very eager to hear your opinion . - Well , it 's obviously not a vampire . - Why not ? Because they don 't exist ? Well , that 's one opinion , and I respect that . Nonetheless , I 'm thinking a murder has been committed here , And we can go down there and help bring a killer to justice ... In whatever form- - Mortal or immortal- - He may take . It 's not that Mexican goat sucker either . [ Man talking quietly ] [ Mulder ] upon arriving at the funeral home , I made an interesting observation , One which you apparently didn 't hear . - That 's a whole lot of caskets . - Largest in-Stock selection in the state . Well , why would a town with a population of only 361 need that ? Repeat business . [ Chuckles ] Mortician humor . Excuse me . [ Mulder ] apparently , your mind was somewhere else . Whoo , boy . [ Exaggerated Texas accent ] y 'all must be the government people . I 'm Lucius Hartwell . He had big buckteeth ? - He had a slight overbite . - No , he didn 't . And that 's significant ? How ? I 'm just trying to be thorough . Anyway , then we went to take a look at the body . Here we go . No exam has been done ? No , sir . This is just like we found him in the motel room , as is . No exam has been done ? Uh , no , ma 'am . Once I heard y 'all was interested , I figured we 'd best leave it to the experts . Now , uh , that can 't be what it looks like , right ? It depends on what you think it looks like , sheriff Hartwell . Vampires have always been with us , In ancient myths and stories passed down from early man . From the Babylonian ekimmu to the Chinese kuangshi , Themotetz dam of the Hebrews , the mormo of ancient Greece and Rome , Right down to the more familiar Nosferatu of Transylvania . Mormo . Yeah . In short , sheriff , no , this can 't be what it looks like . I think what we 're dealing with here is simply a case of some lunatic ... [ Chuckles ] who , uh , has watched too many Bela Lugosi movies . He wishes that he could transfigure himself into a creature of the night . Yeah , okay . What she said , that 's what I 'm thinkin ' . And , uh , yeah . Still , that leaves us in something of a quandary ... Because there are as many different vampires as there are cultures that fear them . Some don 't even subsist on blood . The Bulgarian ubour , for example , Eats only manure . Thank you . To the Serbs , a prime indicator of vampirism was red hair . [ Chuckles ] uh , some vampires are thought to be eternal . Others are thought to have a life span of only 40 days . Sunlight kills certain vampires , while others come and go as they please , day or night . If there 's a point , Mulder , please feel free to come to it . My point is we don 't know exactly what we 're looking for , What kind of vampire- - Or , if you prefer , What kind of vampire this killer wishes himself to be . Now , why is it so important that his shoes were untied ? I 'm gettin ' to it . So while you stayed behind to do the autopsy , The sheriff drove me to the town cemetery . [ Thunder rumbling ] [ metal gate squeaking ] Agent Mulder , you mind me askin ' you why we 're out here ? Historically , cemeteries are thought to be a haven for vampires , As are castles , catacombs and swamps . But , unfortunately , you don 't have any of those . We used to have swamps , only the E.P.A. Made us take to calling ' ' em wetlands . Yeah , so we 're out here looking for any signs of vampiric activity . - Which would be like , uh- - - Broken or shifted tombstones . The absence of birds singing . There you go . 'Cause I ain 't- - I ain 't hearing ' any birds singin ' . Right ? 'Course , it 's winter , and we ain 't got no birds , but- - Is there anything else ? A faint groaning coming from under the earth , the sound of mandication , Of the creature eating its own death shroud . [ Rain falling ] No . No mani- - Man- - Man- - Mandication . Mandication , no . Sheriff , I-I know my methods may seem a little odd to you , but- - Look , y 'all work for the federal government . That 's all I need to know . I mean , C.I.A. , secret service . Y 'all run the show , so- - It 's just that my gut instinct tells me that the killer will visit this place , That it may well hold some fascination , some kind of siren call for him . You know ? [ Horn honking ] Howdy , sheriff ! - Oh , hey , Ronnie . How 's it goin ' ? - Can 't complain . Well , all right , then . Maybe after nightfall , sheriff , but he 'll come . Oh , he 'll come . [ Mulder ] so we staked out the cemetery . [ Animal howling ] Mulder . Shoelaces ? Hmm ? On the corpse . You were gonna tell me what was so meaningful about finding untied shoelaces . I 'm gettin ' to it . Sunflower seed ? Sorry . No , thanks . Do you mind- - Do you mind me askin ' you what you were- - Historically , certain types of seeds are thought to fascinate vampires . Chiefly oats and millet , but , you know , you gotta make do with what you have . Remember when I said before that we didn 't know what type of vampire we were looking for ? Yeah . Oddly enough , there seems to be one obscure fact ... Which , in all the stories told by the different cultures , is exactly the same , And that 's that vampires are really , really obsessive / compulsive . Huh . You toss a handful of seeds , no matter what he 's doing , He 's gotta stop and pick it up . If he sees a knotted rope , he 's gotta untie it . It 's in his nature . That 's why I 'm guessing our victim 's shoelaces were untied . Yeah . Obsessive . Like rain man . When that old boy dropped matchsticks , he had to pick ' em all up . Same thing , right ? Well , he didn 't actually pick ' em up . He counted them . Oh , yeah ! He didn 't have to pick them up . 247 . Off the top of his head . If he picked them up , he would have been a vampire . Yeah . I tell you what . I know I 'm in law enforcement , but I 'd like to take him to Vegas myself . Am I right ? Well , that would be illegal , right ? - He was like a little calculator . - Yeah . [ Woman on radio ] you got your radio on ? Excuse me . Hey , Charlene . What 's up ? I just got a call from the R.V. Park . They got something of a situation there . Sounds like you might want to have a look . [ Engine starts ] Hey again , sheriff . Hey again , Ronnie . [ Ronnie ] I guess you got yourself a runaway , huh ? [ Hartwell ] yeah , Ronnie . I guess we do . What do you think ? We ought to shoot the tires out ? [ Mulder ] anyway , skipping ahead- - Why skip ahead ? What happened then ? Mulder ? You shot out the tires . And what then ? [ Mulder ] okay , here 's something you may not know . Shooting out the tires on a runaway R.V. Is a lot harder than it looks . I then tried a different approach . Whoa ! Hey ! Hey , hey ! Whoa ! - Help ! Whoa ! - Come on , bird - Dog it ! That away ! [ Screaming ] - Oh ! - [ Groaning ] Shee , ow . How you doin ' there ? All right there ? [ Engine sputtering ] [ Mulder ] finally , we prevailed . That 's the same as the others . Right down to the shoes . [ Mulder ] we interviewed everyone present . No one had seen anything . Tired , frustrated and lacking a solid lead , [ Bed vibrating ] I just wanted to get cleaned up . I had the sheriff drop me at the motel , which is where I ran into you . [ Shouting ] what do you mean you want me to do another autopsy ? Why do I have to do it now ? I spent hours on my feet doing an autopsy , all for you ! I do it all for you , Mulder ! I haven 't eaten since 6 : 00 this morning , and that was was half a cream cheese bagel . It wasn 't even real cream cheese , it was light cream cheese ! Now you want me to run off and do another autopsy ? What the hell happened to you ? [ Mulder ] finally , you left . [ Scully ] don 't you touch that bed ! [ Door slams ] [ Bed continues vibrating ] [ Knocking on door , door opening ] [ Ronnie ] hello ? Hello ! Oh , hey again . The lady outside- - She said that , uh , you 'd pay for this . She ordered a pizza from you ? Excellent . How much ? 12.98 . I 'll get my wallet . - How much ? - It 's 12.98 . - Okay , here 's 13 . - Okay , then . Enjoy . [ Door closes ] Ah , Scully . [ Mulder ] so I ate your dinner . And that 's when I saw it . But by then , it was too late . [ Falls on floor ] [ Phone beeps , dialing ] Uh- - This is Scully . Hello ? Uh- - De- - - Hello ? - [ Mulder groans ] Uh- - Uh- - Th- - Creep . Uhh- - Uhh- - You- - [ Hissing ] Oh , man ! What 'd you have to go and do that for ? You are in big trouble . [ Grunts ] [ Mulder ] then I was out cold . I don 't know for how long , but when I finally came to- - [ Hissing ] [ Scully ] Mulder ? [ Gun cocks ] [ Growls ] You 're saying that I actually hit him two times ? Square in the chest . No effect . And then he sort of flew at me like a flying squirrel . Well , I don 't think I 'll use the phrase ... " Flying squirrel " when I talk to Skinner , But , yeah , that 's what happened . [ Mulder ] you checked on me , then left to pursue Ronnie Strickland into the woods . Once I recovered , I knew what I had to do . Help me ! Help ! I caught sight of him , chased him over hill and dale . And in the end- - [ Shouts ] Mulder , it 's not just me . Nobody in their right mind will ever believe that story . They 'll have to , once they examine Ronnie Strickland 's body . [ Sighs ] " Case 0026198 . Ronald Lavelle Strickland . " Probable cause of death- - Gee , that 's a tough one . [ Grunting ] [ Stake clatters on tray ] [ Tools clattering ] [ Hisses ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Growls ] [ Knuckle cracks ] [ Phone rings ] [ woman ] assistant director Skinner 's office . Oh , I 'm sorry . He 's about to go into a meeting . Yes , it may last several hours . You 're welcome . Mulder . Please just keep reminding him you were drugged . [ Whispering ] would you stop that ? It couldn 't hurt . Just stop it . Scully ? Mulder ? I was drugged ! [ Sighs ] I want you back in Texas . Ronnie Strickland 's body has disappeared from the morgue . Apparently in conjunction with this , a coroner 's been attacked . His throat was bitten . The coroner 's dead ? No , his throat was bitten . He was sort of ... gnawed on . Daylight 's burning , agents . [ Door closes ] Well- - He was dead . I noticed that . With a stake through his heart . I noticed that too . So we should find Ronnie out here because ? Because tradition states that a vampire needs to sleep in his native soil . Oh . Yeah . But , Mulder , he had fake fangs . Why would a real vampire need fake fangs ? I mean , for the sake of argument . No , fangs are very rarely mentioned in the folklore . Real vampires aren 't thought to have them . It 's more an invention of Bram Stoker 's . You were right before when you said that this is a guy who 's watched too many Dracula movies . He just happens to be a real vampire . [ Sighs ] Well , so where the hell is he ? What about his family , the ones who were gonna sue us for 446 million ? Well , an aunt and an uncle . Their mail comes general delivery to a local post office . No home address ? [ Mulder ] that 's the sheriff . - Sheriff Hartwell . - Evening , agents . I heard y 'all were back in town . Thought I might be of some assistance . Yeah , a-Actually you can . You can stay behind here with agent Scully while I check something out . Don 't say I never did nothin ' for ya . Where are you going ? Where might you be living if your mail came general delivery around here ? The R.V. Park ? You 're good . Thanks . You 're very welcome . So what do you think about vampires ? You mean , aside from the fact that I don 't believe in them ? Yeah , aside from that . Well , they 're supposed to be extremely charming , Seductive . No , I mean , even if they did really exist , Who 's to say they 'd actually be like that ? As agent Mulder says , there are many different kinds of vampires . Yeah , there sure are . I really need to apologize to you about Ronnie . He makes us all look bad . Uh- - He 's just not who we are anymore . I mean , we pay taxes , we 're good neighbors . Old Ronnie , he just- - He can 't quite seem to grasp the concept ... Of ... Low profile . But though he may be a moron , He is one of our own . [ Cracking sound ] [ Door creaking ] Hello . [ Creaking ] [ On headphone ] ? 20th-Century man that 's what he is ? - Sleeping late . - [ Growls ] Ronnie Strickland ! You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . Come on . Cut it out , Ronnie . [ Ronnie grunting ] oh , damn . Back ! Ah , no ! [ Screaming ] [ Birds chirping ] Mulder ? [ Exhales ] Scully , what happened ? I came to in the cemetery . That 's all I know . [ Horn honks ] [ Car door opens ] They pulled up stakes . So that 's it ? They simply disappeared without a trace ? And that 's exactly the way it happened , from start to finish ? Well , I can neither confirm nor deny agent Mulder 's version of events ... Which occurred outside my presence . And I can neither confirm nor deny agent Scully 's version of events , but , um- - Anyway ... I was drugged . That is , Essentially , exactly the way it happened . Essentially . [ Mulder ] except for the part about the buckteeth . [ Child ] I made this !

 We need this completely filled . We don 't have time to haggle over price . Understood . Captain . Janeway to Voy ... Get up ! Get away from her ! Commander- - any word on that tellerium ? Not yet . How bad is it ? The antimatter reaction rate is down to 12 percent . If it drops below nine , the plasma injectors will lock up and we 'll never be able to reinitialize the nacelles . Options ? If we 're going to reduce our power demands even further , we 're going to have to drop the shields . I don 't want to leave the ship defenseless this close to a hostile planet . All other systems are already off-line . Life support is at minimal . You asked for options . Tha  s our last one . All right , power down the shields . That helped . I  s only a matter of time . There 's nothing more we can do without the tellerium . Neelix to Voyager . Yes , Neelix . The rest of the away team is gone , Commander . They 've been taken by the Mokra . What do you want me to do ? Did you get the tellerium ? Yes , I have it . Then we need you here . Prepare to beam directly to Engineering . Rerouting emergency power to Transporter Room 2 . And ... energizing . Chakotay to away team . Captain , can you hear me ? Unlock the control conduit . Tuvok , Torres , please respond . Keep an eye on the flow rate . Yes , sir . Rate 's holding steady . The reaction rate is stabilized at 13 percent . Up to 15 ... 18 . It worked then . We 're all right ? Maybe . Once the rate is up to normal , we 'll try getting the warp drive back on line . Then we 'll see if there was any damage . Begin rerouting power back to all key systems . What happened down there ? I don 't know , exactly . I went in the shop , completed the trade , then I heard weapons fire on the street . By the time I got out there , the Captain and the others were gone . Are you sure it was the Mokra ? I spoke to witnesses on the street . They said it was quite a fight . Any idea how the Mokra knew you were down there ? Someone must have told them we were coming . The Mokra have informants everywhere . Could your contact be one of them ? I don 't think I would have made it back here with the tellerium if he had been . Besides , he 's involved with the Alsaurian resistance movement . He would never help the Mokra . They 've probably got the resistance movement under surveillance . Commander . I think we 're ready to give the engines a try . I 'm opening the plasma injectors . Warp engines are back on line . All systems normal . Good work , Mr. Kim . Mr. Neelix , you 're with me . I think i  s time we contact the Mokra . Mr. Paris , set a new course . Bring us out from behind the moon and establish a standard orbit around the planet- - slowly . We don 't want to look aggressive . Yes , sir . What kind of response should we expect when they see us ? The Mokra are paranoid and hostile . They have little use for diplomacy . I wouldn 't be surprised if they started shooting at us immediately . We 'll be in full view of the planet in a few seconds . Their orbital sensor net has picked us up . They 're scanning the ship . We 're being hailed . On screen . I am Third Magistrate Augris of the Mokra Order . Commander Chakotay of the Federation Starship Voyager . May I assume you 're seeking permission to conduct business with us ? No . Some of my crew members have already been to the surface . We 've lost contact with them . I see . You must have been unaware of our regulations . I 'll transfer a complete copy for future reference . I have reason to believe they 're being detained . Detained ? Tha  s possible . I 'll look into it for you . I 'll contact you shortly . Thank you . He 's not like any Mokra I 've ever met . I can 't believe he 'll really help us . If there 's any chance for a diplomatic solution , we have to pursue it . In the meantime , I want continuous scans of the surface . Standard search pattern . I advise caution . There 's a control circuit there . I can see it . If only we knew that Neelix made it back to the ship with the tellerium , then at least this would be worth it . I regret I have no such reassurance to offer you . We don 't even know what happened to the Captain . She might have been killed out there on the street . That is possible . It is also possible that she has safely returned to Voyager . We have insufficient evidence to dismiss either conclusion . I guess tha  s the Vulcan way of telling me to hope for the best . Look who 's awake . Just rest . You must be thirsty . Maybe hungry ? For a little something ? Oh , what shall I make ? What , what can I make ? What , what ? Oh ... Where am I ? Oh , it hasn 't been that long . I wish I had some ... There . This will do . T - To drink . Thank you . I 'll fix you some soup . Now , just ... Iie down . You 're very kind , but I have ... I  s all right . You 're safe now . I really can 't ... Shh , shh . Don 't worry . Everything 's all right now . My little girl is home . I 'm very grateful for everything you 've done for me . But you know there 's nothing I wouldn 't do for my sweet Ralkana . My name is Kathryn Janeway . " Kathryn " ? Tha  s an unusual name . Very pretty . I - I like it . I am a starship Captain . It is very important that I contact my ship . Wonderful . Captain ... Kathryn of a glorious starship . Then what happens ? Go on . I 'm listening . I love your stories . I  s not a story . I  s a request . May I use your communications equipment ? Communications ... Uh , we 're not supposed to have any of that . The Mokra don 't allow it . They can 't have control of everything . Surely there 's someone who has an illegal transmitter . I know what you 'd like- - some talsa root soup . Can you at least tell me what happened to the other people I was with on the street ? You really should be more careful out there . Those Mokra will pick a fight for no reason . I don 't want you getting hurt ... again . But I saw the way you handled that ugly one . I couldn 't have done any better . I was so proud of you , Ralkana . My two friends- - did the Mokra take them ? I 'm afraid so . Where would they have been taken ? A detention center ? The prison . All right . How do I get there ? Soup . I 'm forgetting the soup . I appreciate your hospitality , but I can 't stay here . I 've got to get to that prison . You 're right , the time has come . Now we 're together again , we can 't wait another day . My beautiful and brave ... girl . The Mokra won 't stand a chance against us . You 're very kind to offer , but I didn 't mean we 'd be going together . You must eat and rest to get your strength back . We 'll leave soon enough . We don 't want to keep her waiting any longer than we have to . Keep who waiting ? She must miss you so terribly . I  s hard to bear- - thinking of her alone in that dark cell . I  s been difficult for all of us , but don 't worry , we 'll get her out . You 'll see your mother again . Our world has come under attack before . You can understand our concern at finding strangers who arrive secretly from a hidden ship . I assure you , we have no hostile intentions . I believe you , but some of my colleagues are cautious about dealing with ... disreputable ships . What does that mean ? It seems you 've been making more enemies than friends since you arrived from the ... Alpha Quadrant , is it ? Some think even that story is a lie . But not you . Of course not . I am here to help . Then I 'd like to talk to my crew members . I 'm afraid that will be difficult in the current climate of mistrust . Perhaps if you could tell us more about what brought you here- - who you 've been dealing with . I 'll consider that after I talk to my crew members . You 're not making it very easy for me to help you . Let me see what I can arrange . It may take some time . Commander . Talk to your contacts again . I want an alternative to sitting here waiting for him to get back to us . Your question is based on a faulty assumption . I cannot answer it . You can 't deny being in contact with the resistance . I deny that we are intending to supply them with weapons . These lies are useless . We know you 're helping the subversives . I want names . I have none to give you . He told you already- - we don 't know anything about the resistance ! I 've heard that many times from many people . Take him . Lieutenant , stop ! That will not help either of us . He 's right . Open up ! No ! Break it down ! I see soldiers out there . Wha  s happening ? They 're everywhere- - searching the whole area . I don 't want to cause trouble for you . I 'll go soon as i  s dark . You 've always been a troublemaker ever since you could walk . I 've never seen such a willful child . But tha  s what I love most about you- - your spirit . Now , don 't worry . When they come through here , we 'll be gone already . Now , your mother will want some of her things . Ah ... a pretty dress to wear . They 're only looking for me . You don 't have to get any more involved than you already are . Why , if my precious girl is involved then I 'm involved , too . Do you remember this ? She always used to wear it on special occasions . I think today would count ... as one . You know what I think she would like even more ... is to see you wear it . I couldn 't possibly take it ... Be careful , be careful this won 't heal if you move around too much . If you want to help , tell me about that prison . What kind of security do they have ? Are there force fields , detection grids , physical barriers ? Yes , all of it . What about guards ? Lots of guards . The Mokra make a big show of it- - always bragging about how no one has ever escaped . Listen to me ... I can 't bring you to the prison with me . I  s too dangerous . I 'm not afraid . And that could get both of us killed . You have to stay here . If I stay here I can 't bring the letters . Letters ... to the prison ? Letters . Don 't you remember how we used to write to her together ? Here they are . I still write them- - every week since she 's been gone . I 've always known that one day I 'd be able to ... to give them to her . I 've never forgotten . These are all to your wife ? How long has it been ? My last letter ... my last letter 's not ... i  s not here . Oh , I wrote it three days ago , but i  s ... i  s not ... I can 't let her think I 've stopped writing- - that I gave up hope only , only days before ... Huh , I 'll write it again . My hand ... my hand shakes sometimes . You write it so it looks nice . I 'm very sorry , I have to go before the soldiers come . The last one ... the last one was about ... My memory isn 't very good . No , I remember . I went walking in the morning . It was ... it was very cold . Tell her I wore my sweater . She worries about that sort of ... thing . And ... and , uh ... and I , uh , and I what ? And I saw they had torn down that old building where you and the other children used to ... to play . And , uh ... what .. ? Tell her that it rained for two and a half days . I don 't know if she can see the sky ... where they 're keeping her . And ... there was more . There was something about a friend ... I ... Why can 't I remember ? I wanted to tell her ! I  s all right . She 'll understand . Yes , yes , you 're right . She will . Please let me come with you . I 'm sorry ; , tha  s not possible . Check this one here ! Is there another way out ? Open up or else ! There . Open the door ! Open the door now ! Break it down ! This is a waste of time . We don 't need him anyway . I need him . If he 's a member of the resistance , he may be able to help me contact my ship . Monster ! He 's the one . He took your mother . We have to ... They want a fight . Don 't give them one . What ? I 've done nothing ! I 've done nothing . Please ! Please ... You look like a helpful citizen . So , tell me . You might have seen some strangers who were in the marketplace earlier today . No , sir . No , I 've seen no one . Please . You ! I 'm looking for someone , a woman . I haven 't seen any woman . There are two right over here . You see them , don 't you ? Yes . Maybe we should discuss this elsewhere . Caylem ... Good morning . I seem to have lost my hat . I  s about this ... this big . Have you seen my hat ? Run along , old man . Without my hat ? There you go . There ... i  s ... i  s all right now . They 've gone . The prison is in the northeast corner of the city . My sources tell me i  s surrounded by metaphasic shields . Can we find a way to beam through them ? The Mokra aren 't familiar with transporter technology . There is a periodic fluctuation in the shielïs energy pattern . I 'm working on a way to take advantage of it . There 's only one problem with that . If the Mokra detect us breaking through their shields , we 'll be surrounded by soldiers in seconds . If we could beam in close enough to where the away team is being held , we might be able to get in and out of there before the Mokra had a chance to react . We can 't locate the away team from here . The detention level is subterranean and the rock is too dense for our sensors to penetrate . You 'll have to look for them after you beam into the prison . Too dangerous . We can 't risk beaming in . We 'll have to find another way that the Mokra won 't detect . Sounds like a challenge for you , Mr. Kim . You 'd be welcome to use our transmitter if we still had one . The Mokra confiscated it this morning . Then I 'll have to find my crew members myself . I know two of them were arrested . What about Neelix ? He stayed inside with me , then got transported up to your ship . Good . What can you tell me about the prison ? I know about the prison . We need all the information we can get . I have to reach my crew . Don 't you think there are people in there I 'd like to get out ? Any sane person would tell you i  s impossible . Spoken like a coward . I 've heard about you , old man . You 're the coward ! Enough . What are you doing with this lunatic ? Has he been telling you stories of his brave deeds ? They 're just fantasies . Taking him along on this rescue mission of yours is suicide . He 's already saved me from the Mokra once . And he saved you from those soldiers today . All right , stay with him . Go off to the prison , get yourself killed . I don 't have to get killed if you 'll tell me what you know . There are access tunnels on the north side . They 'll get you in a little closer , but they 're guarded . Then I 'll need weapons . They 're not free . I don 't have anything to trade . Tha  s worth some weapons . I can 't . Yes , you can ... if i  ll help to bring her back to us . Thank you . I can have someone meet you on the street in three hours to make the trade . He 'll be wearing a blue vest . Watch for him . We will . Thank you . I 'd wish you luck , but what you 'll need is a miracle . He 's more than three hours late . We have to consider the possibility that he 's been arrested . You mustn 't believe what he told you about me . I don 't believe it . You 're not a coward . I had to keep my little girl safe . It was just too dangerous to get involved . Can you understand ? Your mother wouldn 't listen . She wanted to fight . She was always ... so passionate about what she believed in . She didn 't care about the risk . You were proud of her . I didn 't want to lose her . I didn 't want you to grow up without a mother . I tried so hard to change her mind and finally she changed mine . She convinced me to go with her . I said I would meet her ... by the river . She was leading a raid against a Mokra supply center . I said I would meet her ... but I didn 't ... I couldn 't . I was too afraid . She was still waiting for me when they arrested her . I could never tell you about this . I knew you would hate me . I couldn 't bear that . Please , Ralkana , if you can ever forgive me ... All right , I 'll be right there . What is it ? A blue vest . Then i  s time to go . What happened ? He was wearing military boots like the Mokra . It was a trap . A trap ? And you saw it ? My clever girl . We 'll be all right . We have each other . Tha  s all we 'll need . I  s not that simple . We can 't just walk into the prison without weapons . Maybe we 'll have to try a different strategy . We don 't have to ask your friend any more questions if you give us the answers . I told you , I don 't ... I 'm sorry . I guess I ... I always assumed that Vulcans didn 't feel pain like the rest of us ; that you were able to block it out somehow until I heard ... Was that you I heard ? Vulcans are capable of suppressing certain levels of physical pain . Beyond that , we must simply endure the experience . How can you say that so calmly ? You must feel some anger at what they did to you ... some desire to fight back . Under the circumstances , physical resistance is ineffective . We are ... fighting back by refusing to give them any information . Get down there ! Three more hours . There 's nothing going on around here . Wake me if the Lieutenant shows up , will you ? You girls aren 't supposed to come down here anymore . Do you want me to leave ? I didn 't say that . Then I won 't . If my Lieutenant saw you here , I 'd be in trouble . Nobody will see us back here . I  s dark ... private . I like this strategy . Ready to go ? No ... you 're not coming with me . Of course I am . We settled this . You told that man , Darod , how I saved you from the Mokra ! You did save me . Now I 'm returning the favor . I promise I 'll try to find your wife . Wait ! Ralkana ! No ! I 've been studying their orbital sensor net . It surrounds the entire planet . This is the most sophisticated system I 've ever seen . It monitors everything we do , there 's no way of disabling it from orbit . So much for a surprise attack . We may still be able to surprise them even if they do see us coming . We could modify the main deflector to send out dozens of radion beams which should penetrate the prison shields . One of them will carry our transporter signal , but the sensor net won 't be able to distinguish which one , so the Mokra won 't know the exact location we 're beaming to . And they won 't know where to concentrate their defenses . Tha  s the best head start I can give you . Then i  ll have to do . How long will it take to modify the deflector ? I can do it right now . Chakotay to Paris . Is the rescue team ready ? Standing by . Prepare for transport . Deflector ready , Commander . Initiate the radion beams . Sending out the first volley ... I  s working . They 're getting through the shields . Begin the transport . Transporter Room 2 , synchronize your confinement beams to ... That came from the surface . Maximum shields . Damage report . Shields at 90 percent . That was a precision hit right to the source of the beams . Main deflector is now off-line . We 're being hailed from the surface . On screen . Your attempt to penetrate our defenses is a hostile act against the Mokra Order . There are now 85 phased - ion cannons targeted at your ship . If you don 't withdraw from Mokra space in two minutes , we will open fire . Commander . Give me some good news , Mr. Kim . There 's a disruption in the shields around the prison . That qualifies . Good work . I wish I could take credit for it , but i  s coming from inside the prison . Can we get through ? Yes , but the Mokra will detect our transport . Sounds like they have other things to worry about right now . That disruption might not be accidental . Someone in there might be trying to get out . Tha  s a big assumption . Even if our people didn 't cause the problem , you know they 'd take advantage of it . This is our best chance to find them . In about 30 seconds , the Mokra are going to open fire . I don 't know how long we 'll be able to wait for you . Understood . Darod . I 'm looking for my people . Back this way . I 'll show you . Don 't move . There you are . What are you doing here ? I would do everything in my power to protect my only child . There 's a phased - ion charge coming at us from the planet . Full power to the shields . Shields at 60 percent . Minor damage on Deck 14 . They 're firing again . Modulate the shield frequencies . Try to throw off their sensors . No effect . Direct hit to the port nacelle . Redirect all warp power to the shields . Two more coming in . Captain . We 've got to get you back to the ship . You 're hurt . Ralkana , the other cells are this way . We must find your mother . Follow this passageway until it dead - ends . Then you 'll see a smaller passageway . Captain , what are you doing ? There 's one more person I have to find . Guards ! After all that time I spent looking for you , all I had to do was wait here . Shields down to 23 percent . We 've got to get out of their weapons range . Scan one more time for the away team . There 's no sign of them . Prepare to break orbit . Wait ! Set a course bearing 219 mark 47 . Where are you taking us , Mr. Kim ? There 's a large electrical storm over the northern magnetic pole . I  s giving our sensors some trouble . It should do the same for theirs . - A blind spot . - Exactly . If we maintain our position directly above the storm , their sensor net may not be able to keep an accurate lock on our position . How long do you think this 'll work ? The storm 's already dissipating . A few more minutes ? I 'll take every second I can get . I must say I 'm impressed , Caylem . You never made it this far before . Every so often , he goes on one of his missions ... to rescue his wife . She 's been dead for 12 years . Lies . Lies ... lies ! Sometimes ... he gets all the way up to the front gate . We send him on his way and allow him to serve as a reminder of just how futile it is to challenge us . I thought you 'd learned that lesson when you lost your daughter . She made it as far as the tunnels before she was shot . No ! So much tragedy for one man to bear ... and now your foolishness has condemned another innocent woman . Take the others back for questioning . I 'll interrogate this one myself . No ! I won 't let you hurt her ! Caylem ! Ralkana ... he said you 'd been shot . He was lying to you , Father . I 'm all right . And your mother ? She 's fine . She was so happy to get your letters . She wanted me to tell you something . She forgives you . We both do . My sweet girl . Captain . I 'm coming . No one will forget what he did here today . I 'll make sure of that . Chakotay to Transporter Room 2 . Do we have them ? We 're all back , Commander . Take us out of here . Gladly . Lieutenant , you heard her . The warp drive is functioning normally , and we 'll have the main deflector back on line tomorrow . Yes , thank you , Mr. Kim . Captain , are you all right ? I 'm fine .

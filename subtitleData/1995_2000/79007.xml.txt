[ Groan ] [ Moans ] [ Gasping ] [ Click of release ] Quentin : YOU WANT TO COME WITH US , WORTH ? DOWN THE HATCH . Worth : [ Screaming ] [ Sobbing ] Worth : [ Laughing ] WHAT THE FUCK 'S WITH HIM ? Worth : [ Hysterical laughter ] [ Giggling madly ] [ Ominous ] HOW DID HE ... ? [ Gulping ] IT 'S ... IT 'S ... IT 'S " THE WREN " . THE OLD WRENSTER . [ Giggling ] HOW COULD ... ? WE 'RE GOING IN CIRCLES . [ Snort of laughter ] THAT CAN 'T BE . WHERE ARE WE ? I DON 'T KNOW . [ Opening of portal ] WHERE ARE WE ? YOU FIGURE IT OUT . YOU HAVEN 'T DONE ANYTHING . ALL YOU DID WAS FREAK OUT , YOU ... MURDERER ! [ Sobbing ] [ Giggling ] [ Rumble ] I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT , WORTH . THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF HERE . [ Snuffling ] [ Gasps of despair ] [ Sobbing ] GETAWAY FROM ME . Quentin : [ Blubbering ] WASN 'T RENNES KILLED IN THAT ROOM ? [ Click of release ] HOW COME THERE 'S NOTHING OUT THERE ? IT 'S THE EDGE . WE WEREN 'T AT THE EDGE BEFORE . WHERE 'S THE ROOM THAT KILLED RENNES ? FUCK OFF ! OH , THAT WAS GOOD . WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ? WE 'RE DEAD ANYWAYS . HEY ! LISTEN TO WHAT I 'M SAYING . THERE WAS A ROOM THERE BEFORE . WE HAVEN 'T BEEN MOVING IN CIRCLES . THE ROOMS HAVE . OF COURSE . THE ROOMS . THAT EXPLAINS THE THUNDER AND THE SHAKING . WE 'VE BEEN SHIFTING THE WHOLE TIME . IT 'S ... IT 'S THE ONLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION . I 'M SUCH AN IDIOT . WHAT ARE YOU ON TO , LEAVEN ? GIVE ME A MINUTE . OKAY . THE NUMBERS ARE MARKERS , POINTS ON A MAP , RIGHT ? RIGHT . AND HOW DO YOU MAP A POINT THAT KEEPS MOVING ? PERMUTATIONS . PERMU-WHAT ? PERMUTATIONS . A LIST OF ALL THE COORDINATES THAT THE ROOM PASSES THROUGH . LIKE A MAP THAT TELLS YOU WHERE THE ROOM STARTS , HOW MANY TIMES IT MOVES , AND WHERE IT MOVES TO . A NUMBER TELLS YOU ALL THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . SEE , I 'VE ONLY BEEN LOOKING AT ONE POINT ON THE MAP , WHICH IS PROBABLY THE STARTING POSITION . ALL I SAW WAS WHAT THE CUBE LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT STARTED TO MOVE . OKAY , SO IT 'S MOVING . HOW DO WE GET OUT ? 27 ! I KNOW WHERE THE EXIT IS . WHERE ? STAY AWAY FROM ME . BACK OFF , QUENTIN . I JUST WANT TO KNOW . DON 'T YOU WANT TO KNOW ?

RIGHT . BUT ONLY IN ITS ORIGINAL POSITION . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? UH ... LOOK . THE ROOM STARTS OFF AS A BRIDGE . AND THEN IT ... IT MOVES ITS WAY THROUGH THE MAZE , WHICH IS WHERE WE RAN INTO IT . BUT AT SOME POINT , IT MUST RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION . SO THE BRIDGE IS ONLY A BRIDGE ... FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME . THIS THING IS LIKE A GIANT COMBINATION LOCK . WHEN THE ROOMS ARE IN THEIR STARTING POSITION , THE LOCK IS OPEN . BUT WHEN THEY MOVE OUT OF ALIGNMENT , THE LOCK CLOSES . WITH A STRUCTURE THIS SIZE , IT MUST TAKE DAYS FOR THE ROOMS TO COMPLETE A FULL CYCLE . SO WHEN DOES IT OPEN ? [ Rumble ] [ music ] DON 'T . TO FIND THE ORIGINAL COORDINATES , THE NUMBERS ARE ADDED TOGETHER TO FIND THE PERMUTATIONS , THEN SUBTRACTED FROM ONE ANOTHER . THAT 'S IT . THIS ROOM MOVES TO ZERO , ONE , AND NEGATIVE ONE ON THE X-AXIS , TWO , FIVE AND NEGATIVE SEVEN ON Y , AND ONE , NEGATIVE ONE AND ZERO ON Z. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? YOU SUCK AT MATH .

WHICH MEANS THIS ROOM MAKES TWO MORE MOVES BEFORE RETURNING TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION . DO WE HAVE TIME ? MAYBE . THEN LET 'S GO . CAN YOU WORK THE TRAPS FOR THIS SYSTEM ? FUCK THE TRAPS . LET 'S GET TO THE BRIDGE . WELL YOU THREW OUT OUR LAST BOOT , YOU FUCKING IDIOT . TECHNICALLY I CAN IDENTIFY THE TRAPS . TECHNICALLY ? I THOUGHT THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY PRIME NUMBERS , THEY 'RE NOT . THEY 'RE IDENTIFIED BY NUMBERS THAT ARE THE POWER OF A PRIME . OKAY , SO ? CAN YOU CALCULATE THAT ? THE NUMBERS ARE HUGE . BUT YOU CAN , RIGHT ? YES , YOU CAN . I 'D HAVE TO CALCULATE THE NUMBER OF FACTORS IN EACH SET . MAYBE IF I HAD A COMPUTER ... YOU DON 'T NEED A COMPUTER . YES , I DO . FIGURE IT OUT . I CAN 'T ! I 'M NOT DYING IN A FUCKING RAT MAZE . LOOK ! NOBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD COULD DO IT MENTALLY . LOOK AT THE NUMBERS : 567 , 898 , 545 . THERE 'S NO WAY I CAN FACTOR THAT . I CAN 'T EVEN START ON 567 . IT 'S ASTRONOMICAL . Kazan : TWO .

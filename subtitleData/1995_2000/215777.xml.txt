Brother Matsuba is looking for you . Why ? Tosa-san will be released from prison tomorrow morning . Boss . Chairman Yokoi has arrived . Oh yeah ... You 're making me come to a place like that ? Group Boss . Kumi-Cho What do you want from me ? The man ... who cut off your right arm will be released from prison tomorrow . What do you think about the rumor , Taka-chan ? Rumor ? Yeah . The boss is going to retire and wants to make either Group Boss or Tosa-san as his successor . No idea . Group Boss is the legitimate successor . But for the boss , Tosa-san is just like his very own son . Furhermore , he saved our Group ... This is a really old hat ! The Nakame Group is subordinated to the Musashi Group . At that time , it is impossible that the Groups start an internal fight . Our new boss can 't be just the one who finished off the boss of the Nakame Group . You can 't seriously believe that ! Kei-chan ! Take good care of yourself . Brother Maeda has it in for you . Taka-chan ... I know that , as a yakuza , I 'm a total failure . But I 'm sure that things would change if Tosa-san was my boss . I really believe that . Tosa-san ... ! We 're relieved to see that you 're doing well . I 'm sorry . The boss has an important meeting , that 's why he couldn 't be here . How is his heart ? Not that good . The doctor says another collapse would be fatal . I see . He 's staying at the Hakone Hospital and he 's expecting your visit . His rehab will go on until midday . You should take a rest . You have plenty of time to take a nice relaxing bath . I rented a house for you at close quarters . Do I stop here ? No . Drive on . Yes . Hello ? Hello , boss ! Take brother Tosa in . Yeah , I 'm sorry . Hello ? Yeah , yeah , I know . I know . Yes ! Yes . I remember you . You were a trainee back then ... Yes . I still have it ... Out of the way ! It is so BIG ! Circumcised , too ! You 're that yakuza guy ... Look at you ! No more violence ! Apologize for that ! Ouch ! Hey ! Let 's go ! You bastard ! Hey ... What do you think of my dick ? Who 's got the bigger dick , me or brother Hagane ... ? Look at it . Take a close look ... I inplanted pearls . Look at the two pearls ... Yeah , I see them ... That 's so awesome ... Brother Hagane is dead ... Who cares ? Come on , show me your pussy ... Apparently you woke up . Don 't worry ! I 'll fix you , and then you can move again no time . Okay ? You 're not perfected ! You can 't go out just like that , you 're still not waterproof ! If your heart gets a short right now , you 're dead . Do you want to say something ? What 's going on here ? ! Come on , relax ! Who are you ? My name is Hiraga Genpaku . I 'm an ingenious chemist . Well , some people call me an obsessed ( otaku ) chemist . Some even say that I 'm some kind of " Nutty Professor " ... I don 't care ! I just want to know why I 'm here ! You don 't remember anything ? Maybe the memory circuit hasn 't been functioning fully yet ... Do you remember now ? You and another man were killed . I revived you . Creating the perfect human was my childhood dream . And so I found myself a dead corpse to make my dream come true . Dead corpse ? Yeah . You can get one amazingly easy in the black market . There are a lot of John Does . And there 's always somebody who just wants to get rid of some corpses ... Corpses like you . Three months ago , I paid 2.000.000 yen for the two of you . From whom ? Well ... I just went to an arranged place to pick up the bodies . Somebody told me over the phone where to transfer the money . I don 't know who . These were the rules ! You were in a really poor condition and had lots of bullet holes . But miraculously ... the other man 's heart and your brain were still fully functional ... I waited a long time for a body like that ... Due to my research ... it was possible to connect the brain and the heart and form a human being . You were damn lucky , kid ! Bullshit ! I was fragmented and patched up again ! Don 't worry ! Reassambling head and body is quite easy . Unfortunately , I ran out of super alloy . Someday ... I 'll design your whole body out of metal ... Out of metal ... ? Yes . Even Bullets bounce back . Do you understand ? Your capabilities are exceptional ! Your left eye is an infrared scope , and your right eye can see through metals . Even if your eyes are removed from your head , they still see everything ! Your ears can hear every sound within a radius of 2 kilometres ! Your physical strength is also supernatural . Even if you have to fight ten men , you 'll surely win ... I don 't need that kind of body ! That 's monstrous body ... I 'd rather die ! I 'd rather die ? Apparently you haven 't understood yet why you 're still alive ! Do you want me to thank you for that ? No . No ? The other man covered you to intercept the bullets . It was his will that saved you ! Tosa-san had ... I told you so . I transplanted his heart into your body . He still lives inside of your body ... Is the heart the only organ that you transplanted ? Arms and legs were also transplanted and redesigned . I also copied the nerve tracks that are responsible for ... coordination and fighting spirit . What else ? The dick . Including the balls ! I have Tosa-san 's dick now ... Well , yours was still functional , but ... You 're the strongest of all men now ! By no means you may betray somebody ! An furthermore ... Tosa-san 's ... I have a request . Can you finish the tattoo ? First and foremost , you have to eat metal . It 's the ultimate energy source for your body . Is it good ? That 's not important . Slowly but surely , you 'll lose your human emotions . But if you 're overwhelmed by strong feelings all the same ... you may not be able to control yourself . The results are a loss of energy , system errors and a complete mulfuction . Just take good care of yourself ... I 'm going to lose my feelings ... ? To love somebody , hating , getting angry , crying ... You can do without stuff like that , can 't you ? Oh , no ... I installed a system that 's going to soothe you in case of emergency . If you feel that your emotions are going to overwhelm you ... In this case , push right here and repeat the magic words . Magic words ? Hush , little baby , don 't say a word You have to repeat it three times . What ... ? ! It 's a lullaby . My granny used to sing that song to me when I was little . Defence against an attack from the right side . Defence against an attack from the left side . It 's exactly the same . Move forward . Withdraw . Completed ! It 's Perfect ! What are you doing ? ! What are you gonna do ? I 'm going away . You 're going away ? Why ? ! Somebody killed us . I 'm not willing to accept that . Just don 't do anything stupid ! Do you want to take revenge ? You should be a lover of justice ! Come on ! Repeat the magic formula . Hush , little baby , don 't say a word . If you can 't control your feelings , you 'll get lost ! Professor ! I 'm a yakuza . There are a few things I simply have to do ... before I lose my emotions . No , you 're a hero ! Don 't overexert yourself ! Don 't let your feelings overwhelm you ! It 's me . What 's up ? Red just left . Then go and capture him immediately ! Don 't worry . I have an eye on every move he makes . I 'll study his fighting strength . Did you call the General ? That 's not necessary . Idiot ! What was that ? ! From the hip , understand ? Yes ! The successor hates nothing more than bad golfers . And as long as you play that lousy , I can 't introduce you to him . I 'm sorry ! Idiot ! The Boss can 't do anything but retire ... if his successor nominates me as his representative . The successor 's time has come ! Yes ! Go on ! Yes ! You idiot ! Watch out ! Yes ! Stop stupid idiot ! Tosa is dead ! Brother ... ? ! What was that ... ? You survived , Hagane ... ? ! A doctor saved my life . Did he save Brother Tosa , too ? Hey , you got to tell us ! Was Tosa saved , too ? Are you sure ? I see . Hagane . Could you tell the boss about that ? Yeah ? He 's completely sure that Tosa 's still alive ! Yeah ? Brother . Could you tell me what happened ? Who attacked Brother Tosa and me ? No idea ... I want to know why you betrayed us ! No ... ! Hagane ! I ... I just want to take revenge ... Brother ... He smashed my hands ... Shut up ! Go and tell Nakamura ! We wanted to get rid of Hagane anyway , you idiot . So take care of him ! Brother ! Cut it out , brother . What 's the matter with you ? Stop it . You 're not Tosa-san , that 's not for you , brother . I can talk to Maeda . You say that you 're sorry , and then you 're in again ! Junji . Are you in love with Naomi ? I won 't let you ... make her miserable . What 's going on ? All of a sudden , you 're so cool ... Are you sure that he 'll come ? Yes . Is that a blackout ? Hey . Hey ! Patronage ! Well , well ! I 'm here to talk to the boss . Asshole . You bastard ! Asshole ! Just you wait ! Stop ! Is that a monster ? ! We shot him , but he 's still alive ! Hurry up and do something ! Wait ! Let 's talk about it ! I 'm here to avenge Tosa Yoichi 's death ! No ! It was Mutsumi 's idea alone ! He set the whole thing up . Maeda did it ! They wanted to get rid of Tosa ! What an asshole ! Who sold the corpse and took the money for it ? I didn 't do it ! Maeda said ... He promised that ... he 'd leave the two bodies to me ! Two bodies ? Right from the start ... ? He made me do it ! He told me to kill the man next to Tosa , too . He told me that this man ... What did he tell you ... ? ! This man ... He was worth nothing . If he was dead , we would at least get some money ! They don 't know anything about your skills ! Hey ! Team up with me ! Just tell me what you want ! Okay ? Scum ... ! Hey ! Let 's go ! What 's up ? This bastard Hagane ! Go and get him ! What ? ! Yokoi ... ! Hey ! Hagane ! I 'll keep an eye on the boss . Finish him off ! Hey ! Show me what you got . But ! First , I think you should see ... that I 'm wearing Tosa Yoichi 's tattoo on my back ! You 're really cool ... You bastard ! What ... ? ! Do something ! Hagane ! I didn 't order to kill Tosa ! He did ! He did it ! Maeda set up the whole thing ! And you expect me to believe that ? It 's the truth ! I swear ! You have to believe me ! Is that tattoo really Tosa 's ? What does that mean ? Some parts of brother Tosa 's body ... were transplanted into mine . What ? Transplanted ? Brother Tosa ... He 's living on inside of my body . Forgive me , Tosa ! It was all my fault ! So I haven 't lost you forever . I was so stupid , so goddamn stupid ! I was an idiot , please forgive me ! Forgive me ... Hagane . Hagane ! From now on , you 'll do Maeda 's job ! Do you understand ? Let us fight together ! First , we 'll finish off the Musashi Group ! Okay ? ! Don 't kid me ! I won 't let anybody pull a fast one on me ever again ! Hey ... ! You 're breaking my arm ! Stop it ! Breaking your arm won 't be enough ! I 'm gonna kill you ! Let him go . Taka-chan ... You can 't kill me with that thing . I 'm going to shoot at you anyway . I beg you , Taka-chan . Don 't try to stop me ! I have to revenge brother Tosa ! If you want to kill somebody , you 'll have to start with me . I won 't let anybody attack my boss . I 'll fight anybody and risk my life to save the boss . The Nakame Group was finished off . Brother Maeda is dead , too . That 's more than enough , Kei-chan .

 Come , come ! Please , please ! Aziz . Aziz . Aziz , light ! Aziz , light . Good . We start again . " When the three planets are in eclipse , " the black hole , like a door , is open . " Evil comes " spreading terror and chaos . " See the snake , Billy ? The ultimate evil . - Make sure you get the snake . - Yes , I 've got your snakes . I got all the snakes . So , when is this snake act supposed to occur ? Well , if this is the five and this is the one ... Every 5,000 years . So , I 've got some time , then . You bring them water . Good boy . I will take it to them . Go with God . Be safe from evil . You see here these different peoples , or symbols of people gathering together the four elements of life , water , fire , earth , air , around a fifth one . A fifth ... element . Forgive me , Lord . They already know too much . Ah , father ! - How are you today ? - Well , Billy , well . - You have some glasses ? - Of course . Father , I 'm so glad to see you . It 's the most extraordinary thing . I mean , look , it 's the greatest find in history . Yes , you must be parched . Oh , yes , yes . I 'm sorry . It 's like a battle plan . Here , the good . Here , the evil . And here , a weapon against evil . I 'm going to be famous . Then let us toast to your fame . To fame . Salute . You can 't drink a toast with water . Billy , in my sack , the grappa . Ah , yes ! This I don 't understand , but this could be something ... prehistoric . Maybe , I don 't know . But wait . Here . Look , look . They 're here . This man , this perfect being . I know this is the key , I know it . This divine light they talk about . What is divine light ? Aziz , light ! Much better . Thank you , Aziz . My Lord . Father , this is the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen . Don 't you think ? Are you German ? Lord , I know he was about to discover everything . But there is no worry . I was there in time . Priest , you and those before you , have served us well . But war is coming . Stones not safe on Earth anymore . This ... is really amazing . The fifth element . Take the stones . My Lord , if you take the weapon , we will be defenceless when evil returns . In 300 years , when evil returns , so shall we . Oh , professor ! Professor ! Don 't move ! - Billy ! - I have a gun ! Please , understand . They 're our friends . Friends ? Father , they 've killed the professor ! They 're monsters ! I 'll explain everything . Billy ! - You 're with them ? - Billy , look at me . Look at me . I am your friend . - No , Father . - Billy , look at me ! Please , put the gun down . No ! Billy , no ! Hurry ! The wall is closing ! Here is your mission now . Pass your knowledge to the next priest as it was passed on to you . I will do as you command , but , please , hurry , you still have time . Time not important . Only life important . I will fulfill my mission ! You can count on me ! I will pass the knowledge until your return . - Anything yet ? - No , sir . - Not even a temperature ? - The thermal analyzers have jammed . One of them shows a million degrees , the others minus 5,000 . Let 's see it . It 's taking shape . Send out a probe . Ladies and gentlemen , the president of the Federated Territories . On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds . Oh , I saved this seat for you , Father . President on the line , sir . We 're in position , Mr. President . I have to address the Supreme Council in ten minutes . Just the facts , General .. There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as yet . All the calibres are overshot . We 're initiating a thermonucleatic imaging . So , what you 're saying is you don 't know what this is . Not yet , sir . All we know is it just keeps getting bigger . Recommendation ? My philosophy , Mr. President , is shoot first and ask questions later . I don 't like uninvited guests . - All right , then , Staedert- - - Mr. President ? Yes ? Priest Vito Cornelius , expert of astrophenomenon . I have a different theory to offer you , sir . You have 20 seconds . Imagine for a moment that this ... thing is not anything that can be identified , because it prefers not to be . Wherever there is life , it brings death . Because it is evil . Absolute evil . One more reason to shoot first . Evil begets evil , Mr. President . Shooting will only make it stronger . Probe will obtain its objective in five seconds . Growth rate is at 27 % . Your theory is interesting , Father , but we don 't have time to go onto that right now . Time is of no importance , Mr. President . Only life is important . You 're right . That 's exactly what we 're gonna do . We 're gonna protect the life of some 200 billion of my fellow citizens . General , you may fire when ready . Upfront loading of a 120-ZR missile . Marker lights on the objective . Its structure has just solidified on the surface . I think it 's anticipating the attack . Anticipation denotes intelligence . The most terrible intelligence imaginable , Mr. President . 120 's loaded . The ship is in combat formation . Missiles are loaded , Mr. President . - Staedert . - Yes , sir . - I have a doubt . - I don 't , Mr. President . Staedert . What happened ? Staedert , can you hear me ? Staedert , what happened , Staedert ? - Did you destroy it ? - I 'm about to , sir . The planet has increased in diameter by 200 % . It 's moving towards the ship . What do we have that 's bigger than 240 ? Nothing , sir . Staedert , do you hear me ? Get out of there . I don 't want an incident . Do you hear me , Staedert ? Get out of there . Can you hear me , Staedert ? Do you understand ? Listen . This is the president . That 's an order . Do you understand me ? Do you hear me ? Get out of there ! Good God ! Four a day . I 'm trying . To quit is my goal . I 'm up . All right , I 'm up . God ! Yeah , yeah ! - Yes ? - Hey , dog brain , Finger here . - Hi , sweetie . - I love you too , Major , but you haven 't called me that since basic training . - I was talking to the cat . - Oh , yeah , I forgot . You still prefer your cat to the real thing . At least the cat comes back . You 're still pining for that two-timing slut ? Forget about her , man . There 're a million women out there . I don 't want a million women . I just want one . The perfect one . - It don 't exist , Major . - Yeah , I know . - What ? - I just found a picture of you . - How do I look ? - Like shit . It must be an old picture . Listen , you gotta bring me in your hack for a six-month overhaul . - Negative . - ASAP . - I don 't need one . - Hey ! Are you forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions ? I know how you drive . Finger , I drive a cab now , not a space fighter . Okay , so tell me . How many points you got left on your license ? Major , how many points ? At least 50 . You know what ? You gotta learn how to lie better . See you tonight . Welcome to paradise . Welcome to Fhloston Paradise ! This is Ruby Rhod , your main man , and I will tell you live at 5 : 00 the name of the winner of the Supergreen Gemini Croquette Contest ! The winner will go with me for two days to Fhloston Paradise . So , tune in to Radio Cosmos . Don 't watch it all day , sweety . It 'll rot your brain . For a perfect world . - Give me the cash . - Been here long ? Yeah , long enough . Come on , give me the cash ! Is that a Z-140 ? Alleviated titanium . - Neurocharged assault model . - Yeah , yeah . Good thing for me it 's not loaded . - What do you mean , it 's not loaded ? - Well , you have to ... to push that little yellow button to load it . Take your time . Want me to ... ? Okay ? There you go . Give me the cash ! That 's a very dangerous gun . Maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you , huh ? - You don 't mind , do you ? - No . - You sure ? - No . Take it . I don 't need it . That 's a very nice hat . You like it ? Please enter your license . Yes , yes , just a minute . Welcome on board , Mr. Dallas . - Good morning . - Fuel levels , check . Sleep well ? Yeah , me too . - I had a horrible nightmare . - Propulsion 2-X-4 . You have 5 points left on your license . Yes , thank you for reminding me . Have a nice day . Why not ? You have 48 hours . That 's the length of time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions . - And then ? - And then it will be too late . The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power ... but to exterminate life . All forms of life . So , what you 're telling me , Father , there 's nothing that can stop this . There is only one thing . The Mondoshawan have in their possession the only weapon to defeat evil . Four elements ... gathered around a fifth ... supreme being , the ultimate warrior , created to protect life . Together they produce what the ancients call the Light of Creation . Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe . But if evil stands there ... Then what ? Then light turns to dark ... Life to death ... Forever . Sir , there 's a Mondoshawan spaceship at the frontier requesting permission to enter our territory . Give it permission to enter our territories with our warmest regards . Thank you . Permission to enter granted . Showtime . We are lost . Aknot , we are connected to Earth . Mr. Zorg 's office . It 's Aknot . I 'm so glad to hear you , Aknot . The mission is accomplished . You 'll have what you asked for in a few hours . Good . I 'll meet you at my factory . The attack was launched by two unregistered warships . - Close all borders and declare a state of general alert . - Yes , sir . - Try to make contact with the Mondoshawans . We owe them an explanation . - Sir . 300 years of waiting , for nothing . Father , you should go home now and get some rest . No . The Mondoshawan ... I am their contact on Earth . They will come for me . Father , this is government business now . I will keep you informed . The rescue team has reported from the Mondoshawan crash site . Any survivors ? Only one . Is that what you call that a survivor ? A few cells are still alive . It 's more than I need . Have you at least identified it ? We tried , but the computer went off the charts . You see , normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups , which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself . This has 200,000 memo groups . Sounds like a freak of nature to me . Yeah . Can 't wait to meet him . You okay , General ? Over here . Excuse me . Okay , General , I wanna show you something here . This is a normal human DNA chain , okay ? You , me , anybody , right ? Watch this . The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours . There 's simply more of them , tightly packed with infinite genetic knowledge . Almost like this being was ... engineered . - Is there any danger ? - No , no , no , no , no ! We put it through the cellular hygiene detector . The cell is , for lack of a better word ... perfect . Okay , go ahead . Mr. Perfect better be polite . Otherwise , I turn him into cat food . Activate it . Tissue processing . Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection . This is the last phase . The cells are bombarded by slightly greasy solar atoms , which forces the body to react to protect itself . That means growing skin . Wonderful . Reconstruction complete . Remove the shield . I told you . Perfect . Thermal bandages . I 'd ... like to take a few pictures . For the archives . - What 's she saying ? - I don 't know . Activate the phonic detector . Is ... that thing solid ? - Unbreakable . - Good . If you want out , you 're going to have to learn to develop those communication skills . General alert . Perfect . Ladder on 18 . - Two men with me . The rest to the main ventilation . - Okay , sir . This way . Okay , lady , stay calm . This is the police . There 's nowhere else to go . You 're gonna slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor . Do you understand me ? She doesn 't . I think we need a flying unit here . This is the police . We are processing your identification . Please , put your arms up and follow our instructions . She has no file . She dove off ! - Sorry ! - You 've just had an accident . Yes , I know I just had an accident , you daffy bastard ! - You have one point left on your license . - You have one point left on your license . Look out ! No , no ! Left ! I can 't believe it . Shit ! Any survivors ? Hi . Are you okay ? Boom . Yeah , I understand " boom " . Bada boom . Big . Big bada boom . Big ... bada big boom . - Big ... boom . - Yeah . - Yeah , big bada boom . - Bada boom . Big boom . Big bada boom . You know , you 're lucky you 're not dead . This is a police control . Please keep your hands on the wheel . You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle . We are going to arrest her . Thank you for your cooperation . Sorry , honey . Looks like this is your ride . Open the door . Better do what they say . Sorry . Please ... help . I only got one point left on my license . And I need that to get back to the garage and get the cab a six-month overhaul . You understand ? Can you please open the passenger door ? Please ... help . I can 't . I repeat , can you please open the passenger door ? Yeah , yeah , sure . Why not ? Thank you for your cooperation . Help . Finger 's gonna kill me . Emergency ! Emergency ! One point has been removed ... - Yes , I know ! - ... from your license . This is so stupid . All units assist in pursuit of yellow cab , level 10 . Unit 47 , we 're on the way . As soon as we finish lunch . - Two golden menus . - Thank you . I 'm too old , too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod . Thank you so much . And I 'm definitely too thirsty . Look out ! Whoa ! We got lucky . If they don 't chase you after a mile , they don 't chase you . Maybe it 's two miles . Hang on . Look , lady , I only speak two languages , English and bad English . Run an ID . Don 't get me wrong , I 'm all for conversation , but maybe you can just shut up for a minute ! I get nothing . He 's got a scan blocker . Means he 's a car thief . Blast him . I don 't know what you did to piss these guys off ... but they are really pissed off ! Hold on ! I think we 're safe for a while . You wanna play it soft ? I 'll play it soft . You wanna play it hard ? Let 's play it hard . If we make it to the fog , we 'll be all right . If we make the fog . How do they expect us to find anything in this shit ? We 're just gonna wait here for a little while until things quiet down , if you don 't mind . Hey ! Shit ! You okay ? Priest . You don 't need a priest , you just need a doctor . You 'll be all right . - Vito Cornelius . - What ? Priest . Yes ? I 'm ... looking for a priest . The weddings are one floor down , my son . Congratulations . She 's not my bride . She 's my fare . She 's looking for a priest , named Vito Cornelius . The phonebook said he lived here . Yes , that 's me , but I don 't know who she is . Nobody knows who she is . No file , no ID , nothing . She 's got a tattoo on this arm here . Tattoo ? It 's the ... fifth ... element . Finger 's gonna kill me . - Hey ! Wake up ! - Who are you ? I brought the girl , remember ? The redhead . She just dropped in on me . Started speaking this bizarre language . It 's not bizarre ! It 's the divine language ! - The ancient language . - Okay . Spoken throughout the universe before time was time . - He 's a she . - You noticed that , huh ? Yes . - It 's a miracle . - Miracle she 's not dead . Not a moment to lose . Wake her up . But gently , because this woman is mankind 's most precious possession . She is perfect . Perfect . Something more dignified . Hey , lady , wake up . You 're right , you 're right . I shouldn 't have done that . I shouldn 't have done that . I was wrong to kiss you . But he told me to wake you up gently . You 're right . You 're right . Just thought you might remember me from the cab . Remember ? " Bada boom " ? - " Big bada boom " ? - Boom ? Boom . Big bada boom . In the cab . Here , look . I drive a cab . This is me . Korben Dallas . Korben . You understand ? Here . You take it , go ahead . You can call me when you learn to speak English . Just kidding . I 'm kidding . And you ? What is your name ? You ? Korben . Good . That whole thing 's your name , huh ? Do you have a ... shorter name ? Short . Korben Dallas . Leeloo . Leeloo . Korben , Leeloo . Leeloo , Korben . Father , are you sure she 's a supreme being ? Absolutely sure . Old friends ! Yeah , you 're right . Listen , do you think you could ask her if I could have the gun back , please ? - What 's your name ? - Korben Dallas . Thank you , Mr. Dallas , for all your help . Thank you so much ! You 've been so kind , but now the girl needs some rest . Because she 's been on a long trip . Yes , I know . I was there when she landed . Hey , wait , wait , wait , Father . Listen , she said something that I didn 't understand . Well , I didn 't understand any of that , but ... What does " ekto gamat " mean ? " Never without my permission . " That 's what I thought . I shouldn 't have kissed her . Oh , no . I 'm so sorry . I forgot your food . How about some nice Thai food to apologize , huh ? Yeah , yeah , hold on . - What ? - Hey , Buddy , I 'm waiting all day here . - Finger . - Where is the cab ? Car 's running fine . Purring like a kitten . Fine . What " fine " ? I know you , Dallas . " Fine " ain 't in your vocabulary . Now come on , you can tell your old buddy Finger what happened . - What ? You saved the planet ? - Listen ... You dinged the fender again . That 's it , right ? You dinged the goddamn fender . Finger , I was on my way over to see you , when a big fare fell in my lap . You know , one of these really big fares that you just can 't resist . Oh ! How big ? 5 ' 9 " , blue eyes , long legs , great skin . - You know , perfect . - Huh-huh , I see . And this perfect fare , she got a name ? Yeah . Leeloo . What 's she doing ? Learning our history , the last 5,000 years that she 's missed . She 's been asleep for quite a while , you know . Father , I know she 's been through a lot , but we don 't have much time . Yes , you 're right . Chicken . Good . Chicken . I 'm really sorry to interrupt you , but ... the case ... with the stones ... where is it ? Stolen ? Who in God 's name would do such a thing ? Excuse me , sir . The council is worried about the economy heating up . They wonder if it would be possible to fire 500,000 ? I thought , maybe , from one of the smaller companies , where no one would notice , like one of the cab companies . Fire one million . But 500,000 ... One million . Fine , sir . Sorry to have disturbed you . - It 's for the Supreme ... - Yes , yes . Oh , sorry . I didn 't know your size , and I found you this make-up box . , okay ? You just put it like that . Yes , there was a man with a limp . Came here about a month ago asking questions about the stones . Se said he was an art dealer . What was his name ? I 'm so bad with names . - They really make her ... - Perfect , I know . What did she say ? She says she knows exactly where they are . My dear Aknot , how about those two little planes that you borrowed ? Aknot , is that you ? What an ugly face ! It doesn 't suit you . Take it off . That 's better . Never be ashamed of who you are . You 're warriors . Be proud . So what if the federal government scattered your people to the wind . What doesn 't kill you , makes you stronger . Your time for revenge is at hand . Voilà , the ZF-1 ! It 's light . The handle 's adjustable for easy carrying . Good for righties and lefties . Breaks down into four parts , undetectable by x-ray . Ideal for quick discreet interventions . A word on firepower ... Titanium recharger , 3,000-round clip with bursts of 3 to 300 . With the replay button , another Zorg invention , it 's even easier . One shot ... and replay sends every following shot to the same location . And to finish the job , all the Zorg oldies but goldies . Rocket launcher . Arrow launcher with exploding or poisonous gas heads . Very practical . Our famous net launcher . The always efficient flamethrower . My favorite . And for the grand finale , the all-new ice-cube system . Four full crates delivered right on time . And what about you , my dear Aknot ? Did you bring me what I asked you for ? Yes . Magnificent . This ... This case is empty . What do you mean , empty ? Empty , the opposite of full . This case is supposed to be full ! Anyone care to explain ? The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust . Who took another route . She 's supposed to contact this person in a hotel . And she 's looking for the address . Easy . Dot . It 's Planet Fhloston in the Angel Constellation . We 're saved . I 'm screwed . You asked for a case . We brought you a case . A case with four stones in it ! Not one or two or three , but four ! Four stones ! But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case ? We are warriors , not merchants . But you can still count ! Look , it 's easy . Look at my fingers . Four stones , four crates . Zero stones , zero crates ! Pack everything up ! We 're out of here ! We risked our lives . I believe a little compensation is in order . Oh ! So , you are merchants after all . Leave him one crate for the course . I don 't like warriors . Too narrow-minded , no subtlety . And worse , they fight for hopeless causes , honor . Honor 's killed millions of people . Hasn 't saved a single one . I 'll tell you what I do like , a killer . A dyed-in-the-wool killer . Cold-blooded , clean , methodical and thorough . Now , a real killer when he 'd have picked up the ZF-1 , would 've immediately asked about the little red button on the bottom of the gun . Bring me the priest . I got it . Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel . Good work , my son ! Now , all we 've got to do is find a way of getting there . It 's not gonna be easy . There 's a big charity ball on Phloston tomorrow . The flights are full for months , and with all the celebrities the hotel will be guarded like a fortress . But there must be a way of getting there . I 'll get it . Weddings ? Not really . - Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you . - Mister who ? Mr. Zorg . Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg . It 's nice to see you again , Father . Ah ! I remember you now . The so-called art dealer . I 'm glad you got your memory back . 'Cause you 're gonna need it . Where are the stones ? I don 't know . And even if I did know , I wouldn 't tell somebody like you . Why ? What 's wrong with me ? I try to serve life . But you only ... seem to want to destroy it . Father ... You 're so wrong . Let me explain . Life , which you so nobly serve , comes from destruction , disorder and chaos . Now , take this empty glass . Here it is , peaceful , serene , boring . But if it is ... destroyed ... Look at all these little things . So busy now . Notice how each one is useful . What a lovely ballet ensues , so full of form and color . Now , think about all those people that created them . Technicians , engineers . Hundreds of people who will be able to feed their children tonight , so those children can grow up big and strong and have little teeny-weeny children of their own , and so on and so forth . Thus adding to the great chain ... of life . Water . Fruit . You see , Father , by creating a little destruction ... A cherry . ... I 'm , in fact , encouraging life . In reality , you and I are in the same business . Cheers . Where 's the robot to pat you on the back ? Or the engineer ? Or their children , maybe ? There , you see how all your so-called power counts for absolutely nothing ? How your entire empire of destruction comes crashing down all because of one little cherry . You saved my life . And in return , I 'll spare yours ... for now . You 're a monster , Zorg . I know . Torture who you have to , the president , I don 't care . Just bring me those stones . You have one hour . It 's gobbling up all the communication satellites in the galaxy . Why in the hell is it eating up all the satellites ? We 're working on it , Mr. President . I managed to contact the Mondoshawan . They deplore the incident , but they accept our apologies . And the stones ? Did you find them in the wrekage ? - The stones weren 't on board the ship . - What do you mean ? The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race . They gave up the stones to someone they do trust . Her name is Plavalaguna . She 's a diva . And she 's going to sing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise in a few hours . She has the stones with her . The Mondoshawans have accepted ... All we have to do is send someone to get the stones and bring them ... Excellent . I want this operation to be discreet as possible . No troops . No big operation . I want your best man to go undercover . I have the perfect one . - You got a message . - Yeah . - Not gonna open it ? Could be important . - Yeah . Like the last two I got were important . First one was from my wife telling me she 's leaving . The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife . That is bad luck . But grandfather say ... " It never rain every day . " This is good news , guaranteed . I bet you lunch . Okay . Come on . " You are fired . " Oh , I 'm sorry . Well ... At least I won lunch . Good philosophy . See good in bad . I like . - Hello . - Korben , sweetheart . You got broken fingers ? You can 't punch my number ? - Hi , Mom . - 17 messages . And don 't tell me your machine is broken again . Those things are good for 1,000 years . Mr. Kim , you should go . This is gonna take a minute . You wouldn 't even feed your pussycat a croquette , who you obviously love more than me . - But she didn 't breast-feed you . I did . - Goodbye , Mr. Dallas . Good fortune for you . Oh , Christ , I 'll never be a grandmother ! - Give you good luck ! - Yeah , sure . Korben , you know how my poor body 's failing me . You have to take me on this trip . Mom , what are you talking about ? Oh , I get it . You wanna make your only mother beg , is that it ? No , I don 't wanna make you beg . All I want is an explanation . Look , I just got in . I just smashed my cab . I lost my job . I got mugged . Besides that , everything 's peachy . Thanks for asking . Now , will you just settle down and explain this to me calmly ? Oh , so you don 't know you won a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two for 10 days ? And I suppose you 're just gonna leave me on the lunar surface to freeze my ass off . If I 'd won a trip , I 'd know about it . Somebody would 've notified me . Korben , they 've been blaring your name out on the radio for the last hour , you big ape . Ma , I 'll call you back . General Munro , how nice to see you in the 5,000 block . Nice apartment , Major . Like you 've settled into a wonderful life . Heard you lost your job . You heard that , huh ? Don 't worry . I 'll get another job . Don 't bother . We have one for you . " Major Dallas , you 've been selected for a mission of the utmost importance . " - What mission ? - To save the world . " You leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise , " retrieve four stones from the diva Plavalaguna " and bring them back with the utmost discretion possible . " - Any questions ? - Yeah , just one . Why me ? - I retired six months ago , you remember ? - Three reasons . One , as a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army , you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission . Two , of all the members of your unit , you 're the most highly decorated . - And the third one ? - Of all the members of your unit you 're the only one left alive . Did you check your messages ? No , I 've had enough good news for one day . Might be important . You 're a winner ! You 've won the annual Gemini Contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two . Here are your tickets . - You rigged the contest ? - Uh-huh . Congratulations . You couldn 't think of anything a little more discreet , huh ? Old tricks are the best tricks , ey ? Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife . I am not going . Why not ? Excuse me , general . - Who is it ? - Huh ? Who is it ? - My wife . - You remarried ? Yes . No . I just met this girl , but I 'm gonna marry her . I love her , but she hates the military . She knows that the military ruined my last marriage and she can 't have anything to do with it . If she sees you here , guys , she 's gonna kill me . - Major ! Major ! - Look , We just gotta hide you somewhere . You 've gotta help me . You 've just gotta hide somewhere . We 'd love to help , but , I mean , there 's only one door . Where can we hide ? - Major , we don 't have time for this . - It 's just for one minute . You have no idea how much you 're helping me . No idea . You 've no idea . I 'm going to be happily married . - Major ! - What ? - The three of us won 't fit in there . - Sure you will . Major ! You 're on my foot . Major ! Major ! I 'm really sorry to have to resort to these methods , Mr. Wallace ... - Dallas . - Dallas . ... but we heard about your good luck on the radio and we need your tickets for Fhloston . Is this the way priests usually take vacations ? We 're not going on a vacation . We 're on a mission . What kind of mission ? We have to save the world , my son . - You 're gonna save the world ? - Yes ! - First down there . Down there . - Yeah , come with me . This is a police control . This is not an exercise . Come on , get in . For one minute , all right ? Just stay here for one minute . I promise , you 'll be fine . - This is a police control . - Don 't touch anything . This is not an exercise . Can you please spread your legs and place your hands in the yellow circles ? - What are you doing ? - Saving you ass , so you can save the world . Yeah , but I ... I think this is the door . There 's no name and no number . Let 's see it . Sir , sre you classified as human ? Negative . I am a meat Popsicle . I found him . Mr. Korben Dallas ? Sir , can you put your hands in the yellow circles , please ? Smoke you ! Wrong answer . The police control is now terminated . Thank you for your cooperation . Have a nice day . Okay , we got the guy . Wasn 't easy , but we bagged him . - Thanks for the tip . - Glad to be of help , my friend . The guy 's just been arrested for uranium smuggling . Everything 's going as planned . All I have to do now is go to the airport , take his place , and I 'll be in Fhloston in less then four hours . Don 't come back without the stones . Korben Dallas , we got him . Perfect . Akanit , take command . Go to Fhloston and get the stones . If Zorg really wants them , he 'll have to negotiate . Revenge is at hand . Oh , I am so sorry ! I forgot about the autowash . There 's an autowash in that shower . I 'm so sorry . Autowash . Autowash , yes . Autowash , in the shower . You know , it 's funny . I 've met you twice today . Both times , you 've ended up in my arms . It 's my lucky day . Yeah . Did you hear something ? Cornelius . Autowash . - I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . - I don 't need your help .

Earth . - Open the other one . - Okay . Korben ? Korben , my man , I have no fire . I have no matches . Do you have any matches ? I have no matches . I stopped smoking . If I knew ...

I 'll take you on vacation when we 're done . I swear , a real vacation . A real vacation , just you and me . But , listen to me , if you don 't do something right now , we 're all gonna die . You understand ? What 's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it ? It 'll be entering the atmosphere in 40 seconds . Leeloo , you 're right , you 're right , you 're right . But there are some things , very nice things worth saving , some beautiful things . Beautiful things . Like love ? Yes , yes , love . That 's good . That 's good . That 's a good example . Like love . Love is worth saving . I don 't know love . I don 't know love . I was built to protect , not to love . So , there 's no use for me other than this . No , no , no , you 're wrong . You 're wrong . You 're wrong . I need you . I need you , very much . Why ? Because ... Because ... Tell her , Korben . Tell me . Please .

No , no , I tried . No , ma 'am . - Who 's that ? Some woman . Claims to be Korben 's mother . Well , give it here ! Mrs. Dallas , this is the president . On behalf of the Federation , - I would like to thank you- - - Oh , please ! That doesn 't even sound like him . The president 's an idiot . And you don 't sound like an idiot .

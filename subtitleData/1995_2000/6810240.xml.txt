 I reviewed your case and your service record . Combat duty in Panama , Grenada . Distinguished service in the Gulf . Great triumphs and great tragedies . It 's clear to me that these suicide attempts are ... Cries for help ! You 've tried and failed to kill yourself three times in as many weeks . - Frankly , if you wanted to ... - You don 't understand . He won 't let me . - He won 't let me die ! - Who ? Who won 't let you die ? Just relax a moment . I 'll be back with something to help you sleep . Stand down , Lieutenant Colonel ! No ! Not this time ! Just let me go ! Oh , my God ! - Where is he ? - Down here . He 's in there . I told ya . He won 't let me die . I don 't wanna talk about it any more . I told them and I told them , but they won 't listen . - You mean they don 't believe you . - No , sir . You said that at the time of the accident you believe somebody was in the room . It was no accident . Don 't you understand ? But this person saved your life . Is that right ? Look at me . Look ! I have no life . He took it all away . Do you have any idea who it is ? I never see him clearly . But he looks like a soldier . Always standing ' at attention . - GI ? - Or one of Saddam 's boys , ... Whoever it is , he knows my name . He speaks to you ? " Your time has come " he said . Then he started takin ' it all away . - What did he start taking away ? - Everything . My wife . My children . - And how did he do that ? - How did ... He burned them alive . Now he makes me suffer . Because he won 't let me die . Agents Mulder and Scully ? May I have a word with you ? I 've been asked to have you suspend the investigation you 've begun . - Asked by whom ? - General Callahan , ... - .. Stans 's commanding officer . - Is something wrong ? Criminal investigation of military personnel is to be conducted through military channels . - We didn 't sign in at the front desk ? - You 're in breach of procedure . Excuse me , but does General Callahan have a superior officer ? Ma 'am ? If we wanted to investigate him , who would we talk to ? - Investigate him for what ? - Whatever . - General Callahan is the senior officer here . - We 'd like to speak to him . - I don 't know that he 's available . - Ask him to make himself available . In the meantime , we 'll finish up with Lieutenant Colonel Stans . You never know when he might try and kill himself again . Let 's finish this , Mulder . I keep havin ' the same dream almost every night . I know a lot of crips have the same dream : the walk . In my dream I rise up outta my chair . I can stand . And I look down the hallway . Only I 'm not in the ward any more . I 'm at home . There 's my baby girl . Without even thinkin ' about it , I take a step towards her and I take another step . Then I pick her up and I carry her outside on my own two feet . Outside is my little boy . We run together . Running ! Me ! My legs ! Like they were before . We play a little bit of football . I show him a few moves . Like the old man used to do . We just walk home . No crutches , no wheelchairs . I know I 'll never walk again , but this dream just seems so real . I can 't help but think that maybe someday ... Don 't hold your breath ! We 'd all be interested in your point of view , Leonard . Oh , you really wanna know what I think ? I pity all you guys . I really do . With your handicapped basketball and your wheelchair races . - You all act like we 're normal people . - We are normal people . I don 't know if you 've had a look in the mirror lately , my friend , but you are missing a leg . Aagh ! I don 't have any ! Where ... where did my arms go ? - We all know how you feel . - No , you don 't . How the hell could you possibly know how I feel ? There 's only one way you could ever know , and I can only pray to God ... .. that he 'll take your legs and your arms away and give you a little taste of what it feels like ! Roach . I 'm sorry , gentlemen . Let 's begin again . - What is it , Roach ? - What 's what ? You got that " I 'm freakin ' out " look on your face . What 's the matter ? - It 's nothing . - I spent two years with you in a gun turret . I know when you got somethin ' on your mind . Private , make your report . It 's the FBI , man . They 're downstairs . They 're askin ' questions about the LC . To hell with the feds . All right , Roach ? You hear me ? To hell with them . Just forget about ' em . General . Sir ? - Agents Mulder and Scully to see you , sir . - Thank you , Captain . - General . - I 've had the captain ... .. contact the Justice Department and let them know about the FBI 's gross misconduct here . So this isn 't a good time to thank you for seeing us . Let me assure you , this matter will not go unaddressed . I would hope not , considering the extremity of Lieutenant Colonel Stans ' case . What case ? There 's no case . - Stans is a very sick man . - Yes , so we gathered . But his file is missing important facts which came out in our interview . I 'm sure everything germane to Stans ' situation is on file . Except for any mention of the death of his family in a house fire three months ago . - Well , it was a tragic accident . - No doubt . But there is no record ... - .. of any criminal or arson investigation . - Stans tried to save his family that night . According to him , he was prevented from doing so by some kind of phantom soldier . Look , I 've known Stans a long time and there 's no doubt that he has suffered terribly . Not unlike Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen . You knew Sergeant Aiklen . Isn 't that correct , sir ? He served under me in the Gulf , yes . Six months ago Aiklen also lost his family to a house fire . He received psychiatric treatment for delusional behaviour . He said he wanted to die but somebody wouldn 't let him . Before throwing himself into a woodchipper . Unless that 's procedure , the coincidence of detail has been strangely overlooked , sir . Hold on . Just who 's under suspicion here ? Look , I make no excuses for the sadness of these men 's lives . They are casualties of war . Once brave men who we can do little but feel sorry for . If you think there 's more to it , you are seriously mistaken . That 's your conclusion . But I 'd hope you 'd allow us the opportunity to come to our own . You really think he 's got something to hide ? No . I think he 's got everything to hide . You don 't think he 's closing ranks to protect his men ? I know it 's not what drew you to this case , but I think it 's clear what 's going on here . What 's that ? The general is protecting his men from prosecution for the murder of their families . - Why would he do that ? - I don 't know . - But I can think of several reasons . - They were his soldiers ... .. and he feels responsible for the tragedies ? That could be one . He may know the secrets to their madness : .. the biological weapons they were exposed to during the war . The cause of the effect . Considering the government 's disavowal of Gulf War Syndrome , ... .. I 'd say it 's a pretty good reason to prevent our investigation . But you 're not buying it . What I can 't figure out is why a man who deliberately set out to commit suicide ... .. would leave the one entrance to the room unsecured . Then again , I obviously have a feeble grasp of army protocol and procedure . Come in . I want to apologise , sir . I didn 't mean to put you on the spot like that . I know that , Captain . This whole situation is unfortunate . - Is there anything more I can do ? - No . Go home and get some rest . We 'll deal with it in the morning . Relax , Captain . That 's an order . Yes , sir . Your time has come , Killer . All right , that 'll be fine . Thank you , gentlemen . General Callahan . One of the detectives is saying Captain Draper 's death wasn 't accidental . There are bruises around her neck and her shoulder roughly the size of fingermarks . - Someone drowned her ? - The bruises and surrounding oedema ... .. are consistent with a struggle . - Will you be contacting her family ? - She had no family . The army was her family . I 'm sorry . Truly . I talked with security . Other than Draper , they saw no one enter the pool and no one leave . - The officers are saying she was drowned . - General , do you have a family of your own ? - Yes . Why ? - If the pattern we 've seen is consistent , ... - .. you and your family may be in danger . - Based on what ? The death of my adjutant ? Just keep an eye on ' em . Watch out for anything out of the ordinary . - You 're serious ? - This is a military base . They 've got security everywhere and no one heard a thing . It 's not so hard to believe . Her screams would have been muffled underwater . It also fits the MO of Lieutenant Colonel Stans 's phantom killer . Agent Mulder , what did you mean by that ? - It was just a word to the wise , sir . - No , I mean " anything out of the ordinary " . Any unusual or unexplained phenomena . Last night I saw someone in my office . He said my name , but when I turned around he was gone . Then my phone machine went all snaky again . - Again ? It 's happened before ? - No , not what I saw . But the phone calls , yes . Twice before , at my home . Mom ! Mail 's here ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! - Mom ! - What is it ? - What is it , honey ? - Mom , there was a man here . Who ? Thank God ! I was trying to reach you . Trevor saw someone in the house . - Just a few minutes ago . - Is he all right ? He 's in his room , but he 's terrified . I 'm shaking , myself . - Frances , these people are with the FBI . - Is it about the break-in ? - Check on Trevor . I 'll be right up . - Why ? What 's happening ? Frances , please . We 'll talk upstairs . This way . It just comes on . The phone doesn 't even ring . At first I thought it was a prank . - Did you save the other ones ? - No . I erased ' em . I even called the phone company , had them check the line . They checked the whole house . They couldn 't find anything wrong . Have you noticed any other type of electronic interference , like the radio or the television ? No . Not a thing . There 's someone in the backyard . I saw someone out here . I 'm sure of it . Look . You better call the police , General . You 're gonna feel a little stick here . There . That 's fine . I 'll be back in a minute . That was too close , man . Too close . I ain 't doin ' it any more , you understand ? - What ? - I said I ain 't doin ' it any more . You owe me , Roach . I wouldn 't be in this damn chair if it wasn 't for you . Hey ! This isn 't about you and me , man . This is about all the grunts and all the crips and all the boys who came home in a box ! The enemy must be defeated , and we 're gonna do it . You 're gonna do your part and I 'm gonna do mine . Nurse ! Hey ! What do you do , man , when I rap on the tank ? - Get some , get some , fire at will . - Good . You 're all right . Nurse ! Come on ! This is killin ' me here ! What a mess . You 've got to learn to sit still . How about you never do it right ? ! There . That 'll hold it . Find anything ? No , but I 'm really beginning to like the tune . Whoever 's targeted the general didn 't just leave footprints . - They left fingerprints as well . - Really ? Where ? Forensics lifted two indexes and a thumb . One on the mailbox next to the front door and one on the door leading to the backyard . - We 'd better go run ' em . - They 're on their way to the NCIC . FBI ! Open the door ! - Hands up ! Hands over your head ! - Don 't shoot ! - Turn around ! - OK , OK . Put your hands down behind your back . Cuff him . You are under arrest for suspicion of murder . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can be held against you in a court of law . If you want an attorney ... Captain Janet Draper . Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen . - Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans . - General and Mrs Thomas Callahan . We 've got him , Mulder . Watch your left flank there . OK . Trevor ? Hey , Trevor ! We have enough evidence to place you at each of the crime scenes . In addition to accessory to murder , you 're looking at conspiracy , ... We know you weren 't acting alone , Quinton . We know you had an accomplice . How did he do it , Quinton ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - How did he get past the guard ? How did he kill him ? Trevor was only eight years old ! I don 't know . I didn 't kill anybody . I 'm just the mailman . What does that mean , you 're just the mailman ? Rappo 's mailman . - Leonard Trimble , right ? - If that 's the man they call Rappo . Well , that 's him . What 's he done ? He 's a suspect in two homicides . Rappo ? You must be making some kind of mistake . - How 's that ? - There . See for yourself . He 's a quadruple amputee . Dammit ! - He lied to us . - He said he was the mailman . - What did he mean ? - I don 't know . I 'm adding it to the list . - Are you coming ? - No . I 'll catch up with you later . He knows this place . He can find me here ! He knows this place ! He 's been here before ! I 'm not safe here ! - Hey ! Keep it down in there ! - Let me outta here ! He 's gonna kill me ! I 'm a dead man ! Let me out ! Let me out ! I 'm not gonna tell you again . He 's gonna kill me ! He 's here ! He 's here ! You don 't wanna get him started again . He was pretty worked up about an hour ago . Not as worked up as I 'm gonna be . Visitor . On your feet . Problem . Wait . - How 'd it happen ? - The sheet was stuffed down his throat . - Nobody 'd been in ? - He did it all by himself . - Not likely . - Not likely ? He had help , Scully . I think the man that killed him was Leonard Trimble . Rappo ? He can 't even walk , let alone kill somebody . - See this ? This is a dental x-ray plate . - You 've had it since we got here . The ones I 've been walkin ' around with I already had developed at the hospital . This is the one I had when we first met Stans , this one in the rehab room , ... .. in the pool , the general 's office , his house . All exposed to some kind of radiation . From what ? From Stans 's phantom soldier . I came down here wondering if what Stans described ... .. was a case of astral projection . You 're saying Rappo is leaving his body and floating around killing people ? Practitioners claim that the astral body can detach itself and float virtually anywhere , ... .. sometimes invisible , but sometimes appearing as an apparition . They claim that it has psychokinetic capabilities greater than the corporeal body . Mulder ! Then why would he need Quinton Freely ? Maybe he needs a psychic connection to a place . A thing or an object . A letter . - Quinton called himself the mailman . - It 's insane . Sometimes the only sane response to an insane world is insanity . - Know anything about backwards masking ? - Messages recorded backwards in songs ? Yeah . Or on the general 's answering machine . Check this out . Your time has come , Killer . Your time has come . - Leonard Trimble ? - No , it 's Fred Astaire . Mr Trimble , we 'd like to ask you a few questions about Quinton Freely . Roach ? What 's he done now ? He 's dead . Oh . - Well ... serves him right . - How 's that ? He 's only the guy who turned me into second base by gettin ' my arms and legs blown off . - Other than that , he was a real good guy . - Then why 'd you kill him ? - What 's wrong with this picture ? - We read your medical records . We know you 've refused all efforts at rehabilitation , even prosthetic limbs . - Maybe I don 't want any of that crap . - Maybe because you don 't need it . Because you can leave your body any time you want , kill anybody you wanna kill . If I could leave my body now , I could think of somethin ' else I 'd rather be doin ' . Like kill General Callahan 's boy ? Lieutenant Colonel Stans 's family ? Sergeant Aiklen ? - You 're a real trip . - Because I figured you out ? You 're a soldier . You knew what you were gettin ' into when you enlisted . - Why you wanna blame your cos ? - I blame ' em for what happened to all of us ! You don 't know what it was like . You sat at home and watched the war on cable TV like it was a damn video game . You had no idea about the guys that died , about the blood in the sand . What it feels like when a hit comes . The thing is , you just don 't care , do ya ? You got your crude oil . Just change that station , right ? Killer got his prime time , LC got his fancy little medals . Now take a good look at me . What did I get ? ! Nobody knows how I feel . They took my life away . Yeah . So you took theirs . If I only could . Now , if you 're through questioning me , I 'd like to get a little shuteye . No sleepwalking ' . That 's good . I haven 't heard that one yet . Hardy-har-har . - What do you wanna do ? - Warn Callahan to stay out of his house . Frances ? Honey , leave that . No , I know how it upsets you when his ... toys are spread all over the place . We can handle this , Frances . I don 't wanna handle this . I want my son back . Frances ! Oh ... my God . No one 's answering . The machine 's not picking up . General ? Lieutenant Colonel . - What are you doin ' ? - You were right , Victor . - He won 't let you die . - Sir ? He kills our wives and children , ... .. but he won 't let us die . I know who he is , General . I know who he is . General Callahan , sir ! I 've been waitin ' for ya . - Who are you ? - One of your boys , General . - You killed my wife . - That 's right , sir , I did . And the boy too . Come on , Killer . Come on , Killer Callahan ! Get some ! Get some ! Come on , Killer ! Do it ! Fire at will ! Come on , Killer . Do it ! Come on , Killer . You can do better than that . Come on ! You 're gonna suffer like the rest of us . Oh , you think I 'm gonna let it end this way ? Do ya ? Is that what you think ? General ? He wanted me to kill him . I stood down . I 'm done here . Scully . - He 's having some kind of a seizure . - No , I don 't think so . Nurse ! General Callahan ! Killer . Come on , Killer . Your time has come . General Callahan ! General Callahan ! He 's nonresponsive . Come on . Put him on the monitors . He 's going into cardiac arrest . - And make sure the ... Lieutenant Colonel ! Get the keys . We have to open the door . Open the door ! Lieutenant Colonel , open the door ! General Callahan , are you hurt ? I 'm OK . No physical evidence linked Trimble to the deaths of Callahan 's wife and son . Officially , the investigation remains open , the murders unsolved . Leonard Trimble 's family requested his burial at Arlington National Cemetery . The army denied this request . Trimble was cremated , his ashes interred at a civilian cemetery ... .. in Tannersville , Pennsylvania . Leonard Trimble 's mission was not to kill his enemies , ... .. but to shadow their lives , to keep them alive to suffer the pain that he felt , ... .. to see the view from his wheelchair . Amputees sometimes feel the pain of phantom limbs , ... .. ghosts of hands still clenching , legs still aching . Is it not possible that Trimble developed a phantom soul , ... .. a malevolent psyche that took its violent revenge on those he held accountable ? It was war that destroyed Leonard Trimble 's body . But his wounds went deeper than the loss of his limbs . What destroyed those parts of him that make us human beings , ... .. those better angels of our nature , ... .. I cannot say .

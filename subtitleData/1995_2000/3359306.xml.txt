 [ Woman On Radio ] An eight-year-old boy from Manhattan ... was delivered dead on arrival today- - [ Man On Radio ] The Centers for Disease Control . [ Man # 2 On Radio ] Are we dealing with an epidemic ? [ Man # 1 On Radio ] Whatever the carrier , we know that it 's not the water . We don 't believe that it 's airborne . [ Children ] One , two , three , four- - [ Siren Wailing ] [ Girl Gasping , Sobbing ] [ Man ] Strickler 's Disease was first diagnosed two years ago . We 're no better off now . [ Child Coughing ] [ Man Continues ] I needed you to see this for yourself , Dr. Tyler . It 's the same at every hospital in the city . For the lucky ones , it 's a lifetime in leg braces . - [ Labored Breathing ] - [ Crying ] Most of these kids won 't make it . [ Child Coughing ] [ Labored Breathing ] We need your help . [ Hydraulics Hissing ] [ Wind Howling ] [ Heavy Breathing ] [ Clicking ] [ Hissing ] [ Chirping ] [ Flapping ] [ Man ] Strickler 's Disease came to New York ... like a thief in the night , threatening to steal ... an entire generation of our children from before our eyes . [ Man On TV ] Dr. Peter Mann , Deputy Director of the Centers for Disease Control- - [ Man ] The killer was cunning . It was deadly . Neither a cure nor a vaccine could be found . We at the CDC had to contain it ... before it could spread beyond Manhattan Island . So we went after its carrier , the common cockroach . Or rather she did . Dr. Susan Tyler is the reason that there hasn 't been ... a new case of Strickler 's in this city for six months . - Dr. Susan Tyler . - [ Audience Applauding ] [ Woman Reporter ] Dr. Susan Tyler , Professor of Entomology ... at the New York State University . - [ Reporter Continues , Indistinct ] - Thank you , Peter . I don 't think I need to tell you New Yorkers just how resilient ... - the common cockroach is . - [ Audience Laughing ] Since it has proven to be virtually immune to chemical control , we had to find a new avenue of attack . So , with the aid of genetics labs across the country , we recombined termite and mantis DNA to create a biological counteragent , a new species to be our six-legged ally ... in wiping out the roach population . We call it the " Judas " breed . Once in contact with the Judas ' secretions , the common roaches were infected with an enzyme ... - which caused their metabolism to go into overdrive . - Come on , Susan ! - [ Peter ] You 're missing it . - No matter how much the common roaches ate , every last member of the nest ... starved to death within a matter of hours . - [ Audience On TV Applauding ] - I hope someone 's taping this . [ Man On TV ] This announcement 's been a long time coming , - ladies and gentlemen . - Coming home . The Strickler 's outbreak has officially been contained . - The epidemic is over . - [ Audience Applauding ] Hey , Susan . Honey . - Any other questions ? - Dr. Mann , what did this victory mean to you personally ? [ Peter On TV ] It means that I can move on to other projects with the , uh- - - Our 15 minutes are gone . - [ Peter Continues Indistinct ] And personally , um , it 's where I met my wife . What is this ? Is this some kind of Catholic guilt thing ? We don 't even know what the impact is of what we did . - The impact is that ... - [ Splashing ] a lot of kids will be running around next year because of you . A lot of kids . - Hey ! - Maybe we get lucky . [ Sighs ] Maybe a couple of them 'll be ours someday . - Oh , a couple , huh ? - Mm-hmm . Oh , okay . We 're not rushing things . [ Peter ] I didn 't want to overtax you . It 's been a hard year . [ Susan Laughing ] It 's been a great year .

All right . - [ Siren Wailing ] - Are you sure this is yellow fever ? - What , are you ignoring your pages now ? - Listen , l- - Okay , these two cops saw the broken scaffold , and then the paint mess here . And then they looked through that cellar window . Go ahead . Take a look . - [ Gasps ] - [ Indistinct Chatter ] Pleasant , isn 't it ? Couldn 't let ' em out until you gave me the okay , so- - Roughly , there were three dozen people trapped in here . We got bacterial samples reading off the scale , though nothing 's airborne . We got a Reverend Harry Ping . Preacher , if you can imagine that . He ran this place . Well , there 's no sign of him . - Oh , have you had lunch ? - Uh-huh . Try to keep it down when you see this , okay ? [ Person Coughing ] Piece of shit on the ceiling . Hmm ? - Figure that one out . - Here you go , Josh . - [ Train Passing Beneath ] - The subway ? You know what ? l-l- - This is what I love about my job . I get to travel , see the world ... and meet new exotic cultures . It 's- - It 's all bacterial , but hey , what the fuck , right ? - Thanks a lot , Miguel . - Board up every exit . If this leads to the subways , I don 't want anything to spread . Quarantine everything . [ Car Horn Honking ] [ Sobbing ] What 's going on , Remy ? Oh , I 'm just ... commemorating my sad moments . [ Laughs ] So , we 're at this great restaurant . I 'm thinking , finally , a fucking gentleman . [ Laughs ] I go to the ladies ' room . I come back . I catch the schmuck slipping a half-ounce of sedatives into my drink . What a pervert . This city is full of perverts . You don 't know who anybody is anymore . - Jesus , I look like shit . - Hey , guys . You the bug lady , right ? We 're here to deal . [ Electrical Buzzing ] When you pick them up , you should pick ' em up by this front vein on the wing , 'cause it 's the strongest part of the wing . See , that way you don 't break it . Now , let 's see what else you have in here . Oh , look . - What do we have here ? - Swallowtail ? - Excellent . - How come you like bugs so much ? Just imagine that you 're one of them . What , eating furniture and stuff ? That 's gotta suck . No , no , no . Now , don 't judge them too quickly . These guys were building castles while dinosaurs were still wimpy little lizards . Now , say you 're him . He 's what we call a soldier . Now , there is no way that you would ever quit fighting , no matter how badly injured you were . It would be a battle to the death . - [ Insects Chirping ] - But most insects don 't kill ... unless their territory is invaded . You 'd just stun your prey up here . And then you drag it all the way down through here to there , into what is kind of like a pantry . - [ Insects Chirping ] - Will he eat it alive ? Yeah . They 're not really squeamish about those kind of things . This is the nest . It 's the heart of the colony . The big enchilada . - Why ? - Well , if anything were to happen to the nest , the entire colony would die out . I 'd just bail and start my own . Well , you couldn 't do that . See ... that big guy there ? Next to the queen ? Wait . Look over there . He 's the king . And out of all the nest , he 's the only fertile male . He got a good deal . [ Laughs ] Yeah . It 's a simple structure designed for their survival . It 's perfectly balanced , and it 's very beautiful . Whatever peels your banana , lady . So , you wanna buy the butterflies , or what ? - [ Chirping ] - [ Susan ] You know what ? You guys have done a really good job . So , how about five bucks ? That 's your best ? - I 'm gonna show her the weird bug . - Costs a dollar just to look . It 's a really great bug . Got it on the subway . - We kind of broke it a little . - Okay . My best offer . Ten bucks for everything , plus a specimen jar , some tweezers and some mounts . Deal . Are you crazy ? This is the best . This is our meal ticket . Come on . Bug 's almost dead anyway . [ Blows ] It 's yours . - [ Remy ] You gave ' em ten bucks . - They 're from Alphabet City . There 's much worse things they could be selling . Oh , no . Your papers . Help me get the window . - Susan . Push . - [ Wind Howling ] - Oh , come on . - Oh , I hate this window . [ Remy ] Okay , on three . One , two , three . [ Chirping , Clicking ] [ Man On Police Radio ] Who the hell do you think you are , putting my two officers on quarantine ? [ Peter ] Listen to me , Captain . Those two , they go home , they kiss their wives , they kiss their kids , and I 'm the one with a full-blown epidemic- [ Chattering ] - Come on , Chuy . We have to make dinner . - Dinner . - [ Man On Radio ] I don 't care . [ Peter ] Well , I do care ! Jesus , God , I hate cops . - They make the worst coffee . - [ Siren Wailing ] - Shiny wire . - [ Josh ] Still giving you a hard time ? - [ Peter ] As always . - Don 't stare . People look back if you stare . It 's not polite . - I can 't believe this . - What ? I spend an hour in the field . I get a weekend 's worth of crap . Oh , speaking of that . That turd that I took to the lab ? I found these in it . [ Clears Throat ] What are they ? - Buttons . - Buttons ? Maybe they needed fiber . [ Laughs ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Siren Wailing ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Thunderclap ] [ Laughs ] Sorry . [ Insect Chirping ] Wow . Oh , my God . You 're just a baby .

I was actually thinking I had to get back- - Susan , someone broke into your office , okay ? - I 'm sorry about you losing a specimen , - [ Siren Wailing ] - but let 's try and get our priorities straight . - This is not just a specimen . - I did a pH test , and there are only two species ... - % % [ Piano Continues ] that match what I found . Now , one of them is a leaf cutter ant in the Amazon . The other one we released here three years ago . % % [ Stops ] You said- - Y-Y-You said the ones we released only had a life span of six months . We engineered them to be sterile adults . The Judases were not supposed to last past one generation . - So what happened ? - The one I examined today was a baby . They were designed to die . They are breeding . - I shine them good . - [ Indistinct Chattering ] Chuy , Black Lincoln . Chuy ? Black Lincoln . This one . Chuy , pay attention , please . This is where you found the bug ? Yeah , man . But they changed the lock . You sure you haven 't seen one of those ? No . What is it ? It 's an ootheca . It 's kind of a fancy name for an egg case . There 's probably more , like , weird bugs inside of it . No way . I see one of those , I puke . Here you go . - Here . - Hold on . Is there money to be made on this egg thing ? - Sorry . - Dealing days are over . Vamonos . These egg things look nasty . Thought you liked finding nasty things . Well , what if we go find these things . She 'll pay us , right ? [ Remy ] Is that all you think about ? Come on . [ Coughs ] This bug . What does it look like ? [ Electrical Buzzing ] [ Rumbling , Rattling ] Did you hear that ? - How deep does this go ? - Let 's see . [ Beads Clinking , Echoing Below ] Let 's take a look . - You see anything ? - Not yet . [ Hissing ] Shit . [ Groans ] I dropped it . [ Groaning ] I can 't reach it . Let me try . My hands are smaller . [ Rustling Noise ] - Just leave it . - Well , no . Wait . I think I 'm almost there . How much you think the bug lady 'll give us for this egg thing ? At least a 20 spot . - Jesus ! - [ Laughing ] Fucking moles ! - [ Woman ] Hey ! Got any change ? - Get a job , scag .

Okay , we 'll- - we 'll pay for the lock that we broke , Officer . - I mean , whatever we can do- - - Lady , who am I talking to now ? - You or him ? - You 're talking to me , okay ? You 're talking to me . All we wanna see is- - [ Officer ] See what ? That 's the old maintenance bridge , buddy . [ Peter ] This insect that we are looking for- - [ Officer ] Look , man . Your lady want a bug ... or it 's eggs , or whatever she wants , that 's fine by me . But it 's like Swiss cheese down there . Tunnels in , tunnels out , old tracks .

Please , help me ! - [ Screeching ] - [ Screaming ] - Alex ! - [ Flesh Ripping , Bones Cracking ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Man ] A philosopher named Hobbes once wrote that , " Life , by its very nature , is nasty , brutish and short . " An ant would put it more succinctly : Can I eat it or will it eat me ? - [ Laughing ] - It 's this kind of simplicity ... - that governs the phylum insecta . - [ Telephone Ringing ] - [ Continues Indistinct ] - Hello ? - [ Peter ] It 's me . I got the permits . - You did ? - We 're going down first thing tomorrow . - Okay , that 's great . Listen , honey , I-I gotta go right now . I 'll call you later . - ... or of cellular phones , - Okay . as my distinguished colleague can tell you . So , you think your little Frankenstein has got the better of you ? I was hoping you could tell me . I really need to find some answers , Walter . Dear Susan , is it answers you want from me , or is it absolution ? You still think making the Judases was wrong ? Three years ago , I would 've called it unforgivable . But I have two grandchildren who are alive today probably because of you . It would be a tad hypocritical ... for me to pass judgement . That 's not an answer , Walter . [ Whispering ] It 's not an easy question . But as to the Judases , I think it 's likely some survived . Evolution has a way of keeping things alive . But they all died in the lab . Yes , Susan . But you let them out ... into the world . The world 's a much bigger lab .

I mean , we 're talking tens , hundreds of thousands of generations . - I mean , who knows how many mutations . - Listen , l- - I just don 't fuckin ' get this . How could the- - How could the Judas evolve into this ? [ Susan ] Think generations , not years , okay ? - It took only 40,000 generations for apes to turn into humans . - So ? We changed its DNA , Peter . I mean , we don 't know what we did ! Wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! Hold on ! If that thing has been around , how come- - How come nobody 's ever seen it ? I think we have . [ Flare Whooshes ] Sometimes an insect will evolve to mimic its predator . A fly can look like a spider . A caterpillar can look like a snake . The Judas evolved to mimic its predator . Us . [ Peter ] Nobody up there knows about this ? [ Susan ] Nobody would . Not until it 's too late . These things can imitate us . They can infiltrate us and breed a legion before anyone would even notice . How- - How could you do this ? How- - How could you do this ?

Now , these tunnels may lead to the surface . - Yes . - If we can get ... this car moving , we might be able to make it . [ Loudly ] What- - [ Whispering ] What do you mean , might ? I mean , probably . But even if they do , th-this thing 's been down here rotting for half a century . - How do you know it 'll move ? - Listen to me . Listen .

Do these subway tracks lead to the regular train tunnels ... at Grand Central and Penn Station ? Yeah , yeah . Well , they 'll use them to migrate out of the city . After that , they 'll set up colonies anywhere they can . [ Electricity Crackles ] - [ Panting ] - [ Crackles ] [ Susan ] Now , every specimen we 've seen has been female ... because a male would be a lighter color and it would have no wings . And if they are holding true to the Judas 's spawning pattern , the nest will have only one fertile male . Now , if we could catch that male and kill him , then the females won 't be able to breed ... and the whole generation could die out . Where the hell is the male ? Chuy . Chuy .

 After a 13-year struggle , the authorities have restored order . The resistance seems neutralised . Individual liberties are strictly controlled in order to keep the peace . However , all over the country , individuals continue to challenge the authorities . Living here means living nowhere . The harsh desert wind deadens your senses . Maybe out of boredom or to live before the bomb within us blows , I go out to draw . Not to protest the situation , the curfew , the ban on posters or writing ... Chalking the walls lets me breathe . Its not just political slogans . If a child drew a house or a dog , they 'd erase that too . Maybe they 'll catch me one day but I 'll have lived ! When I found your first drawing , they hadn 't erased it completely . The prisoners ' acid had made the colours virtually come to life in the stone . Someone else was having fun by risking prison , and torture . Théo , it 's your dad . I was just leaving , dad . I 'm on my way . Thanks , Freddy . You 're welcome , kid . The old woman opposite my place ? - Wasn 't she dead ? - She died yesterday . Roias 's son has been killed . Young Alvaro ? They caught him drawing on a wall . And no one did anything . What did you do ? I only heard about it . He was young , poor kid . He was older than me . People who draw on walls are taken out to a place in the desert . But news filters out in the end . We know what happens to prisoners . h ' ever we meet one on the street , we ignore him rather than break the silence . Can you turn that off ? Or put some music on ? If you 're not sleeping , bring a bottle up . I 've got glasses . ls this your new show ? I can do a major show at police HQ with these . Weird things are going on . What do you mean ? You know the landscape I drew on my ceiling ? The one you took photos of ? I saw the same one in the street . Other people draw too . Two clays ago , I saw the drawing of a boy . So ? The boy was me ! Give the gin up , kid . You 're getting paranoid . And you give up being a jerk ! Be careful , it 's getting dangerous out at night . It 's worse staying indoors . I 'm not scared . They 're scared of us . There 's no shame in being scared . There is . You think the resistance exists ? Of course ! You resist . Organised resistance . A secret army , something to get us out of this . I don 't know . Beautiful , huh ? Her name 's Elia . She 's clearing out her gran 's flat . She was at the funeral . Did you see her eyes are different colours ? Do you know her ? A little . She posed for me when she arrived . She 's staying a couple of days . Hurry Up - Try sleeping at night . I can sleep all my life . ls the old man up ? I don 't know what 's wrong with him . You 'll see . Rise and shine , Colonel ! It 's ten , people are waiting . Liar ! Come on , get up , clad . I 'm the boss , I 'll decide . Are those still warm ? They 're warm but they 're mine . You 're a good son . Make me my coffee and I 'll leave you everything I own . Like what ? The restaurant . Don 't you want it ? You want to leave too ? I won 't abandon you . You don 't want to leave anymore ? You considered it . Where would I go and what would I do ? Hi , Théo ! How 's life ? Business is slack . I 've got your order . Hello , sir . Hello , young man . They 've erased it . I don 't get it . They ought to rebuild instead . You won 't teach me ? You 're too small . You have to run fast to draw . You 'll wake the building . What would you have said if I 'd opened the shutters ? Lots of things . But now you 're close it 's different . Sorry about your gran . I barely knew her , I 'm here to sort her stuff out . Have you been drawing long ? Sort of ... My father taught me . Let 's get inside . They 're aliens , you know . I 'm waiting for them to change things . When are they landing ? I don 't know . Maybe they 're here . Maybe I 'm one . I knew you 're from space ! Ever hear the noises when you turn the radio dial ? Those scrambled sounds ? I 'm sure it must be a coded language . From up there ? No , the resistance or the authorities use it to manipulate us . You 're crazy . Don 't you remember me ? Something about your face seems familiar . I lived here when we were little . We went to the same school . I remember you . I had a crush on you . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . It was ages ago and then I left . Can I ask you something ? Why the drawings ? I watched you go out every night . Then I followed you . I felt drawings were my only way to really talk to you . The little boy is you the last time we met . Want to go to the sea with me ? Now ? It 's a lake really but it 's like the sea . Half an hour there and back by car . You have a car ? No , a motorbike but it works . Okay , I 'll go to the sea with you . Tomorrow ? It 's already tomorrow . I feel good . You look at the sky and your body spreads out through the universe . You don 't want to come in ? I want you to kiss me , Théo . Brought many girls here ? I forget now ... It needs salt ! Make your bets ! Ready ? Five more on 3 . 3 is Tonto 's . What ? Since when ? Since always . No , 3 is mine ! - Okay , all mine on 4 . - Let 's go ! Let 's get started . They 're off ! You 're here ? I wanted to see you . Freddy gave me the address . No kiss for me ? What happened to your manners ? My father , Aaron . Mrs Costamar 's granddaughter , she was at the funeral . Yes , I remember . Go and check on them , I bet they 're cheating . I 'm not going to eat her . - Do you have them often ? - Beetle races ? These clays , you need to keep your customers . You 'll stay for lunch ? No , I came to see Théo , don 't let me disturb you . Rubbish ! I 'm the best cook for miles around . Number 3 won . I knew it ! I told you that one always wins . - He asked you to lunch ? - Yes , I couldn 't refuse . This is a restaurant , not a gambling den ! My dad invents recipes and others cook . He complains but he loves it . Here , sit down . If you need anything ... He taught me to draw . He painted until his arrest . They took the colour from his eyes . How does he see now ? In black and white and he 's stopped drawing . Didn 't you have a brother ? Yes , older than me . He 's a magistrate , he write laws ... or something . Does he know you draw outside ? Are you alike ? I don 't know , I hope so . You might see him here . I went out to draw last night . I know . Seen your drawing ? They couldn 't erase it completely . The chalk pigment mixed with the paint ... They always manage to erase them . Eat ... Why don 't you draw by day ? It 's too risky . I 've done it though . It hasn 't rained in a thousand years . Nice change ! I 'll need some dry clothes . You can look at me without turning into a pillar of salt . You want to know . Know what ? About my eyes . You stare but never ask why they 're different . I was waiting for you to tell me . They opened fire during an arrest where I lived . They couldn 't find a transplant the same colour . Mine 's the dark one . Ready ? I 'll just fetch Olga and we 're off . - Where ? - You dance ? Of course she dances . Come on , let 's go . You have to stop seeing Freddy . I know you 're good friends but he 's dangerous for you with his photos ... Freddy 's Superman . It 's not a game . You go out to draw but you 'll be okay because that 's not so serious . What he does is serious ? I don 't know . It 's for your own good . It was a joy dancing with you . He 's finished me off . My turn now ! No , we 're not in the same league . See you ! He 's my brother . This is Elia . - Tell her I can 't dance . - He 's useless . But he 'd do shows for us as a kid . Remember ? I love this tune . Can I dance with her ? Ask her . I spoke too soon . It 's not easy . Put your hands like this . Stand closer and look at the others . Have you been with my brother long ? Sort of . We 've known each other for years . He never tells me anything . I don 't like talkers . Me neither . It 's a sign of weakness . But too much silence ... There are other ways of talking . I 'll come for dinner tomorrow . Will you be here ? Yes . Extension 12 , please . It 's me . Listen ... I can 't do it . Tell them to get someone else . Where are you ? I 've come back . Any plans for the area ? A camp for sports or training , I think . You should come more often . I 'm getting old . The Colonel 's solid as a rock , right ? You live an hour away . I have too much work , dad . Do you plan on working here all your life ? Why not ? Serving people isn 't a job . And serving power is ? Still a virgin , is he ? - Shit ! - She 's getting away ! Eliminate her . She knows too much about us . You want the young lady ? She left this morning with her bags . Here 's Romeo . Any news ? She isn 't coming . What 's wrong ? I imagined too much . - What ? - Drop it , okay ? - It 's because I danced with her . - Piss off , Lawrence . Cut it out ! - See the funny side or ... - Or what ? You will in the end . Never ! - Want a lift ? - It 's okay , I walk it every clay . As you want ... I remember a tale I heard as a child . It said Fate abandoned men for the love of a woman , that they were both hiding somewhere and things had been bad since . Will you vanish again ? I want you to love me , Théo . Get away ! - What is it ? - It 's Théo . What 's up ? I need the phone . Lawrence ? Lawrence , it 's Théo . I need your help . No , it 's not dad . They just arrested Elia . Okay . Her name 's Costamar . See you tomorrow . Sorry , but arrests aren 't my field . I can 't help you . You work there , you know people . You know what happens to prisoners ! Don 't exaggerate ! If they arrested her , she did something wrong . She drew , that 's all . You 're so naive ! No one 's innocent in this country . Maybe she 's in the OTR . - The OTR exists ? - Ask her . She 's not in that . How do you know ? Did she say ? Did you mention it ? I don 't want my baby brother to worry . No one called Costamar was arrested last night . Yeah ? Who did you ask ? It was the army who got her . You 're fucking crazy , Théo . The army 's no joke . They scare you ? Go on , get lost . Get lost . Take a photo . We haven 't arrested you . We ... just ... just have doubts about you . I can keep you as long as I want . People who write on walls piss me off . It 's dangerous ... because the wall stops being a wall and becomes ... a " passage for another world " , as your books say . What 's another world ? Where is the world ? It 's here ! Life , a family , work ... That 's what real freedom is , Elia . It 's not some dream . My job is to wake you up . It won 't hurt ... It 's hot in here . ls your air-con broken ? I haven 't seen you in three days . I was worried . I called Freddy but his line must have been cut . Did you draw this ? I didn 't know you still did it . Why didn 't you tell me ? She really is beautiful . What do you want ? Don 't get nasty . I know what 's wrong , your brother called me . I have to come here to find out where the bottles vanish to . Not now ... Come and sit here . You hardly know her . So what ? She 's the one I want . She lied to you , Théo . What ? I knew Mrs Costamar . She had no children . What do you mean ? No grandchildren either . How do you know ? They must have left years ago . I don 't want you to suffer . They 've arrested her . You have to forget her . Erase her face from your mind . It 's easy for you to say that . I made her go and draw . Understand ? No , it wasn 't you , it 's not your fault . It 's the people who run this country . When they take all our children , maybe we 'll start reacting . Your mother said that . She was right . I got her eyes wrong . You know that guy ... who runs the hardware store . He knows what happened to you . He 's working on the beach today . So what ? No reason . I already know your name . But I want to know more about you . Tell me things , I 'm listening . Go on . My name is Elia Costamar . I 'll soon be twenty-one . I 've just finished my first year of History . History , very interesting . Carry on . My parents live in the city . I came back for my grandmother 's funeral . She used to live here . I have a little brother aged eight . I 'd like to do a thesis ... That 's not what I want and you know it . When did you join the resistance ? No ... You 're wrong . I 'm not in the resistance . Please ... I don 't understand . I want names . How were you recruited ? What did you write on the wall ? I was drawing ... In the middle of the night ? You were drawing ! What 's the drawing ? A code ? Nice transplant ... You 'll need more than that to change identity . I should have stayed at home , no one 's here today . I should be looking for her instead of coming here . Looking where ? Not on this beach . You 're not the first and you won 't be the last . People have been mourning lost ones for years now . But I 'm looking for her . You won 't find her . I like you but I feel like beating you up . Why don 't you tell me ? You know me . What 'll happen to her ? I don 't know . You don 't want to tell me . You already know . I 'm calling from 2228 . Someone 's broken into the second floor flat . Mrs Costama 's place . Freeze ! Elia ? Has anyone seen a girl aged 20 ? Her name 's Elia . She has dark hair . Answer me . Women aren 't kept here . I 've done nothing ! Fuck you . Bastards ! I shit on your heads ! Freddy ! ls that you ? Why 're you here ? I got arrested to find her . You fucking jerk ... Are you wounded ? They put a sack over my head ... with a rat in it . Listen ... From now on ... name no names . Sign no confessions . Look them in the eye and they 'll humiliate you . God , it hurts so much . What day is it today ? Wednesday or Thursday . Have you seen Olga ? I bet she thinks I 'm stone drunk in some bar . If you get out ... What about you ? Screw these shitheads ! They 're going to dump me from a plane over the ocean . If you get out ... tell her ... that I was thinking of her . Be strong ! See you , kid ... Hold him ! With the module , you 're tagged . I handle people like you here . We haven 't arrested you , we just have doubts about you . But I can keep you as long as I want . ls that you ? Lawrence ? Who brought him ? Who brought him here ? He 's my fucking brother , you idiots ! - You lied to us . - Shut it ! Shut it ! What have you done to her ? Just calm down , okay . Leave and forget all this . Where 's Elia ? Elia 's not our concern ... You bastard . Just stop stirring up the shit ! Believe me , Theo , you 're lucky I 'm here to save your hide . Touch her and I 'll kill you , motherfucker ! Sedate him . Don 't worry , clad , it 's me . What happened ? I got arrested . Jesus Christ ... You knew ? Why didn 't you say ? Why didn 't you do something ? What could I say ? Lawrence is my son , your brother . I was a soldier too . That 's life . Sometimes , you turn a blind eye . Hands off ! Hello , Elia ... We 're virtually related . My men say you were turbulent in the night . Where are you , you fucker ? Come on . Here ... I 've done nothing . I want to go home . What 's going on ? Go home . Who did that to you ? Go home , okay ! - Let me leave ... - Calm down , Théo . Calm down , please ... I don 't care ! I don 't care who she is ! It 's all right ... It 's all right ... I saw Freddy . Know what they 've done to him ? I know . I 've been expecting it for so long . It 's a morphine blend to ease the pain . Thank you . Step outside . I know what they want now . They want us to believe there 's no tomorrow . They 're wrong . By stifling us , they turn us into time-bombs . This planet is too small for us . There are no more dreams . The idlers left are waiting for a place to come free . It 's all sham , all bullshit . Tomorrow exists and I dream ! An " 84 " near the ramparts ... IT HURTS ME TOO Lawrence , it 's me . We have to talk . I want to see you . Tomorrow , okay . Take care . You know , you can do time for removing the module . We 'll work something out . Look , I spoke to clad ... Would you like to go abroad ? Twenty 's a great age to travel at . I can give you money . Did you handle Elia ? Forget her now . Did you handle Elia ? Drop her . Answer me , Lawrence ! Who the hell cares ? What did you do to her ? I hope you 're joking - For her , I 've nothing to lose . She was really pretty . But we 've sullied her now . You 're upset , huh ? Someone has to pay ? So shoot . The resistance group told me to kill you . Don 't look for excuses . There is no fucking resistance . Just people who write on walls and whom we wipe out . That 's what I 'm paid to do . Remember that dog that scared you on the way to school ? Remember when it tried to bite you ? You beat it to death . That 's what I did . And you started crying . I couldn 't believe it . I just couldn 't believe it . You think I enjoyed killing that mutt ? I did it for you . Go ahead , do it . Go on . I can 't turn back . I 've already lost you all . I 'm not going to beg you . Shoot me . Where is she ? ls she alive ? I love you , brother . Go on , shoot . Shoot ... Report OTR JIK 669 . Agent Nora Cardoso has been arrested . Operation abandoned . Target executed by an outsider . Report OTR JIK 669 ... Riots have broken out in the desert . An armed OTR group has attacked government forces . The official communiqué speaks of isolated terrorists . All the same , the necessary measures have been taken to protect the population ... IT HURTS What else could I draw ? What message could mean anything now ? I had to find a way to say good-bye and tell you to carry on . I had to leave something before returning to my refuge without mirrors , just a hole to hide in until the end in darkness ... remembering so many things , and , just as I imagined your life , I 'd imagine you going out at night to draw . I 've been looking for you for two years and I 've been out to draw every night while thinking of you . I 'll find you , my love , whatever happens . Even if they crush us , even if I have to search every house on the planet . I 'll find you . Subtitles : Ian Burley Processed by C.M.C. - Paris

 ( rumbling ) ( radio ) .. rocked New Mexico . Centred under the desert the 5.6 tremor was felt as far away south as Corona and Roswell . - Where are you going ? - Riding . I 'll be back in a few hours . Eric . Leave the snakes alone today . They 'll be angry and afraid . I found something . You better come see . ( woman ) Robert , come home right now ! What do you think it is ? I don 't know . ( speaks Navajo ) What did he say ? He said it should be returned . They will be coming . ( beeping ) You bitch ! Beautiful ! A van ti . Yes ? Ja . Gut . Gentlemen ... That was the phone call I never wanted to get . - Check the bedroom . - Clear ! ( banging ) - What are you doing here ? - Can we talk inside ? I 'm not feeling well . I didn 't sleep last night . Really not in the mood for the Three Stooges . - I don 't think we 've been followed . - Who would follow you ? A multinational black ops unit , code-named Garnet . Trained killers , School of the Americas alumni . Have you been defacing library books again ? They don 't want us . - They want him . - Kenneth Soona ? - We think that 's his real name . - You 've heard us call him " The Thinker " . What did he do ? Hacked into the Defense Department computer system . - Why ? - The Thinker 's an anarchist and a snoop . Whatever he got into has made him a very wanted man . Customs and Immigration are on full alert . Every port of egress is closed . - Why are you coming to me ? - In his last communiqu√© the Thinker named a meeting place and a three-hour time window . He asked specifically for you . The problem is he may already be dead . ( gunshot ) ( woman screaming ) - What happened ? - She shot her husband . Married 30 years . - Like she went crazy . - OK , go back to your apartments . We 'll handle this . Excuse me , sir . Weirdness . I don 't want you to know my real name . I don 't think it 's that important that you know . Sounds like a line I used in a bar once . I 'm sorry about the wait , but I got this ninja party shagging my butt . Why ? What have you got ? If I 'm correct , I got the original Defense Department 's UFO intelligence files . - Everything from 1940s and up . - Everything ? - Everything . Roswell , MJ12 , and beyond . - You 've read them ? Not entirely . I downloaded all I could and then I split . I knew these guys were gonna be after me . What makes you think they know who you are ? I didn 't take any precautions . I mean , I didn 't even expect to get inside ! They 've always denied that these files even existed . What do you want from me ? I want the truth . And I want you to promise that those rat bastards answer to the people . - Mulder , Skinner 's looking for you . - Come in and lock the door . - Why ? What 's going on ? - Do you know the Ten Commandments ? - You want me to recite them ? - Just the one about obeying the Sabbath . God made heaven and earth , but didn 't tell anybody about his side projects . - What are you talking about ? - The biggest lie of all . - What is this ? - The holy grail . The original Defense Department files . Evidence that the government has known about extraterrestrials for 50 years . - Where did you get this ? - Your friendly neighbourhood anarchist . No . I don 't believe this . This is just gibberish . Dammit ! I 'm so sick of this crap ! BS and double talk . I can 't believe this . - Mulder , this may not be gibberish . - It 's a joke , Scully . It 's a bad joke ! I think it 's just encrypted and I think I recognise it . It looks like Navajo . It was used during World War ll . It was the only code the Japanese couldn 't break . - I remember the long strings of consonants . - Well , can you find out ? - Only a handful of people can decipher it . - Then find one of them . Mulder . - Are you OK ? - Yeah . I just haven 't been sleeping . Sir ? - Agent Mulder , I need to speak with you . - About ? - Agent Mulder , I need to speak with you . - About ? - In my office . - Why ? Is it another jerk-off assignment where I end up doing the government 's dirty work ? It 's about a rumour that you may be in receipt of some sensitive files . - I don 't know anything about that . - Agent Mulder , listen ... I 'm talking to you ... Are we finished , Agent Mulder ? Are we done ? We 're done . - You wanted to see me , sir ? - Yes , Agent Scully . Please have a seat . Agent Scully ? You heard about the incident here in the hallway yesterday ? Yes , sir . Do you have any explanation as to Agent Mulder 's bizarre behaviour ? No , sir . Agent Mulder told me he was having trouble sleeping . Do you think Agent Mulder confides in you , Agent Scully ? - Of course . He 's my partner . - Your partner ? Weren 't you assigned to Agent Mulder to debunk his work ? Yes , sir . A year and a half ago . I 've been writing reports stating the validity of Agent Mulder 's work on the X-Files . - Would you lie to protect him ? - Am I being accused of lying ? Agent Mulder has been notified of a disciplinary hearing . If there 's something we learn then that you haven 't stated here today you may be subject to the same summary action . What action is that ? Dismissal without chance of reinstatement . Is that all , sir ? Yes , Agent Scully . Thank you . ( doorbell ) Hello , Bill . - What are you doing here ? - I 've come on some pressing business . - We had agreed you would never ... - That was a long time ago . There have been unforeseen events . No one was supposed to know . Who could have predicted the future , Bill ? That the computers you and I only dreamed of would be home appliances ... - .. capable of technical espionage . - The files should have been destroyed . They should have , but they weren 't . Regret is an inevitable consequence of life . How do you know my son has them ? The man who stole them has come forward . Oh , God . As always , we maintain plausible denial . The files are only as real as their possible authentication . - My name is in those files . - The files have been encrypted . We have a certain luxury of time . We endeavoured to prevent that fact from ever coming to light . You wouldn 't ... harm him ? I 've protected him this long , haven 't I ? He 's been provident in the alliances he 's created . The last thing we need is a martyr or a crusade . But if he should ... learn of my involvement ? You 're your own man , Bill . You always have been . But I strongly encourage you in that event to deny everything . It 's good to see you again , Bill . You look well . ( creaking ) You didn 't answer your door . I took a pill . - I couldn 't find you at work . I was worried . - I came home . I must be running a fever . Maybe it 's the threat of being burned at the stake . They called me in today . - What did you tell them ? - That nothing was wrong . You told them the truth , then . You opened the door for them . They 're just looking for a reason . OK . I 'll say I 'm sorry . Mulder , these files , um ... Who knows you have them ? - Why ? - Because I had to lie today . And I put my job in jeopardy in order to do so . - If they find out ... - How would they find out ? Maybe they already know . The question is ... is it worth it ? - Is it worth risking everything ? - I 'll tell you when I know what 's on it . Now just tell me who I can talk to about breaking that code . I 'm meeting with somebody in an hour . I might know something later tonight . I just need some kind of assurance that they won 't let us hang ourselves with this . That I 'm doing the right thing . I 'll try to find out . I need to know one more thing , Mulder . Why did you attack Skinner ? I 've thought about that , Scully . I honestly can 't say . - This is all you have ? - Currently . There are words I recognise , but you 'll need a code talker to make any sense of this . I know a man who might help . I can have him contact you . Yeah , thank you . Could you tell me which words you do recognise ? This word ... it means goods , merchandise . And this one means vaccination . They 're both modern words , which is why they stand out . Thank you . You 've been very helpful . ( phone rings ) Mulder . Fox , this is your father . I need to see you right away . - Where are you ? - I 'm at home . How soon can you be here ? Fox , ifs very important . Mulder ? ( gunshot ) ( tyres screech ) - Fox . - Dad . What is it , Dad ? Come in . It 's ... It 's so clear now . Simple . It was so complicated then . The choices that needed to be made . What choices , Dad ? You 're a smart boy , Fox . You 're smarter than I ever was . About what ? Your politics are yours . You have never thrown in . The minute you do that , their doctrines become yours . And you can be held responsible . - You 're talking about the State Department . - You 're going to learn of things , Fox . You 're going to hear the words . And they 'll come to make sense to you . What words ? The merchandise . Look , I , um ... I 've been taking some medication . You 'll have to excuse me for a moment . ( gunshot ) Dad ? Dad ! Dad . ( tyres screech ) Oh , Dad . Forgive me . ( phone rings ) Hello ? My father 's dead , Scully . Where are you ? They shot him ... and he 's dead . Mulder , where are you ? Just tell me where you are . I 'm on the Vineyard . Who shot him , Mulder ? I don 't know . Mulder , were you arguing ? I didn 't do it , Scully . He was trying to tell me something . - Mulder , listen to me . - You 've gotta believe me , Scully . Mulder , I believe you . Just listen to me . You 've got to get out of there . Leave immediately . I can 't leave the crime scene . It 'll look like I 'm running . - Like I 'm guilty . - They 'll suspect you anyway . You 've got no ID on the shooter . Your behaviour has been irrational lately . Mulder , can 't you see that everything is pointing directly at you ? - It was somebody else 's weapon . - Mulder , you 're an FBI agent ! You have access to weapons other than your own . - All right , meet me back at my apartment . - No . You can 't come home . Someone shot through your window tonight . Almost killed me . They may be trying to kill you . Oh , Mulder . My God ! Look at you , you 're sick . - I 'm all right . I 'm OK . - No , come on . I want you to lie down . No , come on . I want you to lie down . Let me take your coat off . We gotta find him , Scully . No , you have to lie down . Over here . We gotta find out who killed my father . Right now you need to rest , OK ? Just rest . There . It 's OK . It 's OK . Scully ? I 'll compare them when I get the bullet from the victim . How long will it take to see if they 're a match ? They 're both .9mm rounds . Run the specs . Compare the strike . We should know pretty much right away . - Scully . - You took my gun . - You think I did it , don 't you ? - I ran it through Ballistics to try to clear you . - Why didn 't you ask me ? - You had a temperature of 102 last night . - I didn 't wanna wake you . - Afraid I 'd shoot you too ? I 'm being called to Skinner 's office today . I need to give them some answers . To clear your conscience and your name ? ! You 've been making reports on me since the beginning , Scully ! You 're sick . You 're not thinking straight . I 'm on your side . You know that . Look . You have my files and you have my gun . Don 't ask me for my trust . Mul ... Damn . I 'm gonna kill you anyway , Krycek , so just tell me the truth . Did you kill my father ? Did you kill him ? Answer me ! - Mulder ! Don 't shoot him . Just back away . - He killed my father , Scully . - I have him , Mulder . - No , Scully ! ( woman ) Oh , my God ! Somebody call the police ! He 's awake . Mulder ? Mulder , it 's me . Here , drink some of that . You haven 't had any water in over 36 hours . Your shoulder will be fine . The round went through nice and clean . - You shot me . - Yes , I did . You didn 't give me much choice . - You were about to kill Krycek . - Why shoot me ? He 's the one . If he is , his weapon is the one that killed your father . - What do you mean ? - If you killed Krycek with that weapon there would have been no way to prove that you didn 't kill your father . I 'm sorry about your father , Mulder . I haven 't been able to tell you . How did you know it was Krycek ? I didn 't . I went back to your apartment to pull the slug from the wall . But I noticed an unmarked van delivering soft water . And I found this in one of the tanks servicing your building . - What is it ? - It 's a dialysis filter . It 's a device used in the transmission of substances to solution . Considering the level of psychosis you experienced , it was possibly LSD ... " amphetamines , or some kind of exotic dopamine agonist . Oh , my God . - There was a murder at my building . - Well , it wasn 't an exercise in subtlety . These men are possibly the same ones who killed your father and who systematically tried to destroy you , turning everyone you could trust against you . I don 't think I have to tell you why . I 'd gotten too close to the truth . - Where are we ? - We 're in Farmington , New Mexico . - New Mexico ? - We drove two days across country . I put you out to let the effects of the psychosis abate . This is Albert Hosteen . He 's been translating your files . You 're lucky she 's a good shot . Or a bad one . Albert was a Navajo code talker during World War ll . He helped encode the original documents . How did you find him ? Through a woman in Washington . But he claims that he knew you were coming . Last week we had an omen . Most files are written in jargon , but there was an international conspiracy of silence dating back to the 1940s . Albert says that evidence of these secrets are buried on a Navajo reservation near here . He says that he 'll take you as soon as you 're able . What about you ? I 'm afraid you 're on your own with this . I didn 't show up for a meeting with Skinner day before yesterday . I don 't know what the repercussions will be . You 've taken a big risk . I was certain they would have killed you , Mulder . Thank you . Thank you for taking care of me . There 's something else . My name is in those files . - It 's in the latest entries with Duane Barry 's . - In what context ? It 's not clear , but it has something to do with a test . I want you to find out , Mulder . I need you to . - You said you knew I was coming . - In the desert , things find a way to survive . Secrets are like this too . They push their way up through the sands of deception , so men can know them . Here . This is my house . But why me ? You are prepared to accept the truth , aren 't you ? To sacrifice yourself to it ? I don 't understand . There was a tribe of Indians who lived here more than 600 years ago . Their name was Anasazi . It means the ancient aliens . No evidence of their fate exists . Historians say they disappeared without a trace . They say that because they will not sacrifice themselves to the truth . And what is the truth ? Nothing disappears without a trace . You think they were abducted ? By visitors who come here still . - What 's buried out there ? - Lies . You will see for yourself . It 's through those rocks . It 's down there . ( phone rings ) - Mulder . - You 're a hard man to reach . - Not hard enough , apparently . - Where are you ? I 'm at the Betty Ford Center . Where are you ? I need to talk to you , Mr Mulder . In person . There are things to explain . I 'll save the government the plane fare . But which government is it ? Your father may have told you things . I warn you against taking those things at face value . Which things are those ? He was never an opponent of the project . In fact , he authorised it . - That 's what he couldn 't live with . - No . It 's because you had him killed . - We weren 't involved in that . - You black-lunged son of a bitch . I 'll expose you and your project . Your time is up . Expose anything and you only expose your father . ( helicopter ) - Sir , we got a coordinate . We 're ready to go . - Let 's go . Take her up ! Over here . - This is a boxcar . - Refrigeration car . ( phone rings ) - Scully . - Yeah , it 's me . Where are you ? Nowhere I ever expected . What do you mean ? I 'm in a boxcar buried inside a quarry . There are bodies everywhere . - Bodies ? - Stacked floor to ceiling . - What happened to them ? - I don 't know . Mulder , in these files I found references to experiments that were conducted in the US by Axis-power scientists who were given amnesty after the war . - What kind of experiments ? - Some kind of tests on humans . But they 're referred to as merchandise . But these aren 't humans , Scully . From the look of it , I 'd say they were alien . - Are you sure ? - I 'm pretty damn sure . Wait a second . This one has a smallpox vaccination scar . - Mulder ... - Oh , my God , Scully . What have they done ? ( helicopter ) Mulder ? Mulder , what happened ? Move out ! Get away from there ! You go back ! Cover us . We 're going in ! Clear ! Go ! What 's your name , boy ? He 's not here . Where 's Mulder ? - He 's here . - No , sir . If he was , he 's vanished without a trace . Nothing vanishes without a trace . Burn it ! - Clear out ! - It 's done . Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! Visiontext subtitles : David Van-Cauter ( child ) I made this ! ENGLISH SDH

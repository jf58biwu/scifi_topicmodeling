Never thought of marrying her in ten years ? Well ... She wanted to pursue her career . She what ? Are you sure ? But how did she get it ? That 's her friend . I know him . I didn 't know he was associated with gangsters . I don 't think she knew it . He may 've been in trouble so left it in her care without telling her what it was . Drugs ? You mean like cocaine ? Did you find any ? Not really . I don 't know . No , I don 't . I really don 't know . Why ? ... Why commit suicide ? Hello ... Where have you been ? Stop turning off your mobile when you drink Need to talk about clients screening tomorrow . What ? Don 't you remember me ? You bit my hand and left this scar . You staggered at the platform ... and were almost hit by a train . So I grabbed you , remember ? Hey . What was going on then ? What do you want ? Wanna do ' it ' , or what ? Sex . Don 't you know ? Guys , someone wants to have sex with me . Hi . Nice to see ya . Listen up ... I 've got an early day tomorrow , but I 've got no time to play with kids like you . On top of that , I 've got no money , Sonny . I paid you back . Paid back . I think we robbed this guy before . - Yeah , we sure did . - We were playing the ' subway game ' . It was Chisato 's turn . He threw us his wallet and ran away like a dog . What 's it with you today , pop ? Stand up . Bring your money to our club . You shouldn 't tell him where . Oh , he means no harm to us . 'Cause he 's a chicken shit . Don 't do anything funny , or you 'll be in trouble . I 'm already in deep shit . Even a worm turns , so to speak Ain 't that right , Chisato ? Kiriko ... how did you get the gun ? How the hell did you get it ? What 's so funny ? Our clients looked very satisfied . My grand daughter 's eyes are glued to the TV whenever ... your commercials are on . Goda , make yourself available for next one , will you ? Sure . - Well , then ... - See you . He looks better . Even at the loss of his girlfriend , he doesn 't take even a day off . - You know ... - Yes ? How does one get a gun here ? What ? Oh that ... " Toy Gun Shop " Shut your goddamn mouth up . Sorry ! - Hold it right there . - Ok . You got any idea how much a gun costs ? How much ? 2 million for a gun and 500,000 yen for 5 bullets . How much is it all together ? 2.5 million yen . You got that right . I 'll get you the money tomorrow morning . This is a deposit . Umm ... You got a ' chief special ' ? This is strictly between us . If you got any problem , come to me first . Don 't talk with anyone in the syndicate . How has your son worked out so far ? He 's just fine . He used to be wild and got into fights ... when he was your son 's age . Me ? I don 't remember . You don 't say . But I think no one could 've kicked your ass when you were that age . I was much younger . The time was right after World War II . No training needed then , it was the way of life . So much for my past . You came to see my son ? Come on in . Shigeo , your friends are here . Hi . Please take this . When you gonna rob somebody , make sure he 's weaker . Thanks for your help then . 'Chief Special' No , no . I don 't have it , but I 've got ' speed ' and ' weed What 's ' speed ' ? It 's ' shabu ' . You mean methedrine ? Good evening . Thought you were at work . What 's this ? Ringo Kid : Dismantle a gun . Use tin foil to pass the custom check . Jun Wayne : Import some parts , then you can reassemble a gun . Better Tomorrow : Someone made a real gun out of an old toy . You mean illegally made ? Can 't give you a receipt . It 's a toy gun , right ? Don 't make any trouble for me . The same size as this ? Yes , the size of a pencil holder . This , too , the same size , using this material ... I see . I want to use it for a long time . So please make it strong . Wow , Idei gave us a lot . Don 't be an ' amateur ' . Here is your ticket to heaven . You should try this , Goto . I got it , Sugar . You 're stuck with real hard job , Honey . It ain 't a Utopia here . Forget about ideal . Then you start to feel better . You got the money , pop . Good ! Where the hell are they ? Tell me ! I 'll break their necks ! What 's going on there ? That hurts , man ! Don 't make the scene at my club . Who 's this guy ? He 's nobody . Get outta here , jerk ! - Did that jerk scare you ? - Not a chance . Good girl , good . How did you get this scar ? I got it recently . The best I 've ever felt . I threw myself ... into a moving car . What about this ? That 's nothing . A punk stabbed me with a knife . Why do you take speed alone ? I don 't want anyone to see me ... just like I 'm eating or having sex . You 'll die ... 'Chisato Will Die at Midnight Tomorrow' Who the hell cares ! What do you want from me ? What 's it about tomorrow ? None of your business . Tell me what 'll happen ? It 's a group of punks . They 're pushing us around ... so we 'll whack ' em . Where is it ? You want a day off ? You want me to tell it to our boss ? Are you out of your mind ? Goda ... hello ... Hey ! You ! What 's going on there ? What 's that shitty face for ? Who the hell you think that car belongs to ? Get rid of him fast . Shit ! He 's fucking heavy . Me ? I 'll find work like anybody else . Can 't go on like this forever . I 'll go to college to study science and engineering . - You know what ? - What ? I 'll bring a bat with lots of nails stuck in as a weapon . How about yours ? Mine ? My fists will do . I 'll blow ' em away with my punches . - Hope we can work together . - I do , too . I am off this way . See you . Listen , Goto . Teach those punks a real lesson tonight . Show ' em how serious we are . You ain 't scared , are you ? ! Idei I 'll kill ' em for sure . I was told you 've got guns ! Give me a break ! No guns here . Please ! Sell one to me ! I want a ' Chief Special ' . I need it ! I 've been watching you . You 'll get this if you do me a favour . Marry me . I can 't go back to my country now . I need more money to live here . More and more . I need a visa to stay here , so getting married is the answer . Let me ask you a question . Was it his gun , the guy who was killed ? He said to forget him if he died . That 's what I am doing now . Do I sign and put my stamp here I can be your ' wife ' sometimes . This is our wedding ceremony . Kiriko ... There 're a lot more punks than us . We 'll manage . It 's a matter of when we hit ' em . Listen , Goda . You take care of that tough lookin ' guy . Forget about the rest . Well , let 's see ... you and you ... Move your asses now . You get back in the car . Hey , get back and stay there . Meet me at our base ! Meet me there , guys ! I 'm coming you , Sucker ! Get ready for my fists . Here they come ! Take that shortcut ! These guys got no guts . 'CHISATO WILL DIE' Hold it right there ! Let 's see ... So it looks like we got into a gun fight . In that case ... Carry this guy to my club . Take this one back to his place . Chisato and Goto , you do that . Don 't take him to hospital . Make sure you grab that thing ... on your way out . Hey ... You wanna die ? Did you send this to Goto ? I 've been watching you . Who did you send it to ? Take it easy on that speed , will you ? I never touch . What ? That shit . I 've never done it . What 's on your mind ? Don 't go too far . What do you care ? Why are you ... always in the fast lane ? Mind your own business . My girlfriend ... died here . Why did she ... kill herself ? All right , sucker ! I tell you why . It was you who killed her . It 's your fault . You don 't know you 're such a selfish bastard ! You care only about yourself and ... will never understand her feelings . But then again , it 's not only you . I know there 're many people like you in this world . They all killed her . Go ahead . Pull the trigger ! Do it yourself . No , I didn 't mean it . Like you said ... I am the one who didn 't want to get married Never mind . It 's not your fault . I 've never taken marriage seriously . I think I 've been trying not to see things that are important to me . People have kids because they need a reason to keep living . Or else I 'll get lost just like a kite in the wind without a string . This is an answering machine so please leave your message after the tone . Goda , it 's about the assignments . I found a director to do the commercials . Kiriko ... my string ... will break soon . Let 's have ... our own kid . Give us your money now ! Who do you think you are ? Grab it . Hey , the whole town knows what you 're doing . Keep it down will you ? Go out and shoot the bum under the highway . That bum stinks . Do it quietly . Goto , you go . Congratulations on your job . Who you 're staring at ? We all know about it . A business suit will look good on you . Never mind the bum . Kill anyone who disgusts you ... and then you can redeem your honour . In your dreams , you kill people but don 't get caught . The whole thing about Tokyo is a dream . We are all in the fucking dream . ... please leave your message after the tone . Hello ... Goto has been standing ... at a place with a gun in his hand for an hour . If he gets caught with the gun ... you will never get it again . You care less now ? No I do care . I need it for once . Where is he now ? In front of a police station . Are you sure about that ? Of course I am . I 'm here now . He 's right there . Goto was riding his bicycle but that cop thought he stole it and treated him like a criminal . The cop is just a dirty-mind in a uniform . Goto hates a man in uniform who looks down on others . Hey , you ! Hold it right there . Yes ? There you are again . That bicycle looks different to the one you had before . Where to ? Come over here . Come here , I said . You come here . You say what ? Let see ... You covered the registration number with paint here . See ? I can 't let you go free . You 'd better come with me . Let 's talk somewhere else . Shut the fuck up . My time is too precious for a punk like you . Excuse me ... That punk ! Hello . Stop this shit . Give it to me . That 's mine . No way . Maybe you 'll do . Shit ! I 'm in chaos . It would be easier to give the gun back . It takes years of training to turn one 's body into iron like yours . Where the hell are you ? Hey , tell me ! Hey ! Gang 's fight ? A boxer was shot to death . A boxer ! Our business has made us a lot of enemies . But in this case ... shooting the boxer just might be the end of all of us . Radar captures our movements by 0 . I seconds and ... calculates the subsequent moves up to two years in a row . That means we can 't fight our destiny . The door ... was open . I want to ... ask you a favour . Two of our guys were killed . The rest can 't step out of the club . It 's only a matter of time 'till the shooter finds us . - Is it too much to ask of you to join me against the shooter ? - I 'll do it . I 'm scared . We won 't do it then . It 's not that . I am scared ' cause what if I make it ? What 's next ? You don 't know what you 're doing ! Why him ? ! Do you really think he 'd be any help ? You gave him the gun ! He may be the one who killed our friends ! Do you hear me ? ! Don 't worry , I won 't use it on you . Let him help us . If that 's what he wants to do . You 'd better do what you like . We 're stuck in an endless game . What 's wrong with you ? ! Hey , Chisato . You 'd better take a rest . Hey . No , mum ! I won 't be home for dinner . Kids ... don 't play bad games . Well ... let 's get outta here . So long .

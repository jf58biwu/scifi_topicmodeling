 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi Quiet , quiet ! Listen to me ! It was a terrible thing . You 're not going to believe me even when I tell you . Some say it is a story ... a fairy tale . But I saw it . I saw it with my own eyes . Quiero hombres fuertes . Rapido . Oye . Gracias . No . Si . No . Let 's go . No . Maria . Mm-hmm . Las cabras . Maria . Maria ! Maria . Maria . Madre de Dios . Mulder , and this happened how long ago ? Tres dias . ¿ Muy incredible , no ? Only the smell . Mulder , you brought me out here under the pretense of investigating an unexplained death . Can you tell me why we 're standing out here in the middle of a field looking at a dead goat ? According to eyewitnesses , the death we 're investigating was preceded by a fortean event . That 's a highly unusual or infrequent meteorological phenomenon also known as a transient . - A transient . - Yeah . Witnesses described a bright flash about 30 degrees off the horizon . Then a hot , yellow rain fell from a cloudless sky . Fortean researchers call these liquid falls . Black and red rains are the most common , but there have also been reported cases of blue , purple and green rains . Purple rain ? Yeah . Great album . Deeply flawed movie though . Mulder , this transient , as you call it- - this bright flash in the sky- - I assume you think it has some connection to ... Fortean events have been linked to alien encounters , cattle mutilations- - the kind of exsanguinated animal carcass you were just looking at . And the victim , Maria Dorantes- - did she die in a similar fashion ? I would assume so . You assume ? Nobody 's examined the body ? Nobody cares , Scully . The victim and many of the witnesses are illegal immigrants , migrant farm workers . I thought it might be important to talk to them before they migrated . ¡ La migra ! No , no la migra . No la migra . No la migra , no la migra . La FBI . No la migra . It 's all right . We don 't want to take anybody away . Relax . No , it 's okay . Tranquile . What do you want ? We want to know what happened to Maria Dorantes . Does anybody know what happened to Maria Dorantes ? Did anybody see anything ? El chupacabra . That 's what happened to Maria Dorantes . ¿ El chupacabra ? Yeah , it 's a Mexican folktale . El chupacabra , the goat sucker . It 's a small , gray creature with a big head and a small body and black , bulging eyes . Si , si . Si . Light ... then rain . Then el chupacabra . It comes and eats away Maria 's eyes and face . Did you see the chupacabra ? No . But everyone here knows this is the truth . This woman 's a liar . There is no chupacabra . Chupacabra 's nothing but a story told to children . I know the killer of Maria Dorantes . Who would that be , sir ? It was my brother , Eladio Buente . He killed Maria because she loved only me . Uh , how do you explain the yellow rain then and the dead goat over the hill ? It is a trick ... for fools who believe in fools ' superstitions . Thank you , Mr. Buente . You 've been very helpful . Maria , Maria . I just met a girl named Maria . Doesn 't make a whole lot of sense , Scully . It makes perfect sense , Mulder . Admit it , you fell for it . Your " fortean event " turned out to be nothing more than the oldest story in the world . Two men , one woman . Trouble . I admit there 's a strong suspicion of motive and intent , but the amount of detail , the description of that chupacabra ... Mulder , what we 've walked into here is a Mexican soap opera- - and one for the local cops . Local cops don 't care , Scully . I don 't know who does . Okay . Well , I care , but what are we supposed to do about it ? Find out what killed Maria Dorantes . Take a look at her body . While you do what ? Try to find this man Eladio Buente . Agent Lozano ? I 'm Special Agent Mulder . I 'm with the FBI . The FBI ? Here ? We 're investigating the death of a migrant worker . Really ? I 'm looking for a man named Eladio Buente . He hasn 't been seen for three days , and he 's not in police custody . I thought he might be in INS custody . He might . Let 's see . Okay . We have a Jose Feliciano . We have Juan Valdez . We have Cesar Chavez . We have Placido Domingo here , but I don 't see any Eladio Buente . So you are telling me that no one here uses their real name . What is this man wanted for ? Possibly the murder of a woman named Maria Dorantes . Oh , man . The chupacabra ? Yeah . You 've heard of it ? You don 't believe it ? No , I believe these people , but their lives are small , so they have to make these fantasies just to keep on going , to feel alive . Because they 're strangers here ; they feel hated , unwanted . Whenever their passions become inflamed , they resort to violence , and then they cannot turn to the law , so they make up these fantastic tales . Call it anything you want , but this is an age-old story . I 've heard that . Well , let 's see if we can find your Eladio Buente . Excuse me . Excuse me . Can I help you ? I 'm Agent Dana Scully with the FBI . I 'm investigating the death of a migrant worker . Juan or Juanita ? I 'm sorry ? Doe . A man or a woman ? A woman named Maria Dorantes . I need to determine a cause of death in order to close out an investigation . It sounds vaguely familiar , but I don 't think I 've been able to get to her yet . Well , I 'm a medical doctor . If you show me the body , I can examine it myself . It 's in the fridge . I don 't think he 's going anywhere . That 's her . Oh , my God . This must be him . Why is he segregated like this ? ¿ Por que lo tiene segregado ? Los otros detenidos lo molestaban mucho . Ninguno se le acerca a el . Le tienen un miedo terrible . He said the other detainees were giving him a hard time- - causing trouble . They don 't want to go near him . They think he 's the chupacabra . That may be , but I will tell you with a tremendous degree of certainty this guy is not Erik Estrada . Buente . El FBI . Quieren hacerte unas preguntas . Ask him if he killed Maria Dorantes . Quiere saber si mataste a Maria Dorantes . ¡ No ! ¡ No lo hice ! ¡ Soy innocente ! ¡ No soy asesino ! What did he say ? " I didn 't do it . " Ask him what happened . ¿ Que fue lo que paso ? Huvo un ruido como un relampago muy cerca ... There was a noise like thunder but very close . ... un rayo muy brillante ... And then there was lightning . Very bright- - it blinded me . Y caigo al suelo ... I fell to the ground ... Y senti la lluvia caliente cuando volvi a ver ... And then I felt the hot rain fall on me , and when I finally could open my eyes and see ... ¡ Via al chivo muerto y luego vi a Maria ! I saw the dead goat , and then I saw Maria ... Maria . Y dijo mi nombre una vez . Tirada en la lluvia amarilla . She called my name once . She was lying in a puddle of yellow rain . Algo le habia comido la cara . Something had eaten at her face . Pero murio en mis brazos , senor . Then , I held her in my arms , and then she died . Y empece a gritar y a correr . And then I got up and I ran , screaming . ¡ Soy innocente ! This guy is better than Erik Estrada . ¡ Chupacabra ! What 's going to happen to him ? He 'll get his 45 seconds before the judge , and he 'll be placed on a southbound bus . There any way to delay that ? Why would you want to do that ? Try to solve an unexplained death . I would think the FBI 's got better things to do . File your paperwork . By the time they process it , he 'll probably be back here anyway . Put him in the front . Up front here . Okay , vamos , let 's go . - Did you find Eladio Buente ? - Yeah . I found him . Did he confess to the murder of Maria Dorantes ? Not exactly , no . Did he tell you what happened ? Flash of light , yellow rain ... Maria ! Maria ! He didn 't kill her , Mulder . I examined the body of Maria Dorantes , and I believe that her cause of death was natural , albeit strange . She seems to have succumbed to a massive fungal infection . A fungus ? Aspergillus , according to the coroner . It 's a mold that 's found in dead leaves , compost , even household dust . And it can kill ? Not normally . It 's actually very common and quite harmless . You don 't think that 's weird ? Well , aspergillus can be lethal to people with immunodeficiencies , like AIDS patients and transplant recipients . And I found high levels of methyl bromide in her blood workup . It 's a pesticide that 's used for soil sterilization . Highly toxic . I think that her body was so ravaged by pesticides that a normally benign fungus may have compromised her whole immune system . Still doesn 't explain the flash of light and the yellow rain . And el chupacabra . Mulder , I know you don 't want to hear this , but I think the aliens in this story are not the villains , they 're the victims . Look at that . Isn 't that the INS bus ? Mulder . What does it look like ? Appears this man died of systemic shock brought on by what appears to be another massive fungal infection . The same fungus that killed Maria Dorantes ? No . It looks dissimilar . I don 't know what this is , but its speed and its aggressiveness are frightening . The infection 's covered 90 % of his body , Mulder , through both layers of skin . Did you find him ? We were able to round up most of the people who escaped from this vehicle , but Eladio Buente wasn 't among them . No one knows where he ran ? Agent Lozano , this is my partner , Agent Scully . They all ran the other way , away from el chupacabra , the man they say is responsible for this tragedy . Eladio Buente didn 't kill this man ; he didn 't kill anybody . I 'm not so sure about that , Scully . Mulder , this is the work of a pathogen , of some kind of a highly virulent strain . I 'm not questioning that , but right now , Eladio Buente is the only connection we have to this death and to the death of Maria Dorantes- - which is why I need you to spare any manpower you can - to try to find him . - Manpower ? We don 't have the resources to go chasing after one poor illegal . Mulder , whatever you hope to learn by finding this man , we have to first make a definitive classification of the fungi taken from the victims . I need to isolate it and I need to get a sample of it to a mycologist as quickly as possible . Good . You should do that , while Agent Lozano and I try to find el chupacabra . Te molesta que te vea asi . ¿ No es cierto ? ¿ Por que habia de molestarme ? Soy tu mujer . Senor . Pero no me di cuenta . Te diste cuenta perfectamente pero eso no importa . Lo importante es como lo mirabas tu a el . Federico ... ¡ Si , lo mirabas ! - Senor ? - What do you want ? You want to go back ? ¿ Estas loco ? We haul mucha basura with that truck . What makes you think we haul it back ? How long have you been in this country ? ¡ Ni credito ! Ni caridad . Aqui es America , you dumb wet . Truck stop at dusk . No dinero , no ride . ¿ Comprende ? Si . Dinero . Dinero . Construction . I need two construction workers- - dos . Okay . You two in the back . Let 's go . I only need two , amigo . Dos . Hey , out of the truck . I got work to do . Hey ! Where are you going ? You 'll have to do . What you 're looking at , Agent Scully , is the most ubiquitous fungal spore known to mankind- - dermatophytosis . Athlete 's foot ? One of the great survivors of countless extermination efforts . Historically underrated and unfairly overshadowed by the ever-popular cockroach . But our body has natural defenses against this kind of invasion . I mean , even in the absence of an immuno-response , fungi like this one or like the aspergillus sample that I gave you- - don 't they need the right environment to multiply ? Yes . Unless they have help . What 's this ? It 's an enzyme I isolated from both your specimens , but that 's about all I can tell you . It 's unlike any enzyme I 've ever seen . So it 's not the fungi but the enzyme that kills . Acting as a catalyst . As an accelerant . Let me show you . This is Puccinia graminis . Black stem rust . It 's been the cause of a fairly containable crop blight here in the valley . Now ... Oh , my God . I must say , if this were to get out into the environment , dermatophytosis might give the cockroach a run for its money . Hmm ? Culver , Culver , se llama . Gracias . He was here , all right . They say he got into the truck of a foreman named Culver . Story 's out . Oh , yeah . I told you . These people love their stories . It 's the one thing that keeps them from going mad when they 're out there standing on a street corner all day waiting for work . So they really don 't think he 's the chupacabra ? No . They 're certain of it . Did you tell them about the fungal infection ? Yeah . They wouldn 't listen . They are only interested in what will become of Eladio Buente . What will become of him ? When his brother finds him ? He 'll kill him . Yes , probably . A man cannot live with vengeance in his heart . So we got to find him first . My mother used to say that blood should be left to cleanse itself . God curses the man who stands between two brothers . Well , in this case , he 'll curse the man who doesn 't . ¿ Senor ? ¿ Senor ? ¿ Jefe ? ¿ Senor Culver ? ¿ Jefe ? Hey , jefe ? Eladio Buente ? Eladio ? Eladio Buente . ¡ Asesino ! Gabrielle ! Gabrielle ! Gabrielle , por favor . Eladio ! Mulder , it 's me . Hey , Scully , where are you ? I 'm at the state university bio department . Mulder , listen to me . I think you 're right . I think Eladio Buente is responsible for those two deaths . Responsible how ? By spreading an enzyme produced by what appears to be a new strain of conidial fungi . How 's he spreading it ? My guess is by touch . I saw this man , Scully . He was unaffected . He could be just a carrier then- - a kind of Typhoid Mary . Are you saying it 's a new strain ? Yes . Mulder , it is extremely important that you not come into direct contact with this fungus . You must not inhale it , you must not touch it ... Lozano . Careful . No . Scully , I 've been thinking . I know that 's dangerous , but just bear with me . These fortean transients- - what the women described- - they could have been caused by an object falling at a high rate of speed through the atmosphere creating a sonic boom and a flash of light- - what astronomers call a bolide . A bolide ? Created by a meteorite or a piece of extra-planetary material , of which 2,000 tons fall to the earth every day . Now , now , this yellow rain- - the space debris could 've fallen in a nearby lake , superheating the water and sending it skyward , which would mean that this is alien . Mulder , I think this is beside the point right now . Oh , and the fungus ... Mulder , let me work on the fungus , okay ? What you need to do right now is to find the man who may be spreading it . Okay . So , you got your own stories , too , huh ? Hey . It 's El Barbera . Hey , Lozano . I hear you 're looking for the chupacabra . For a modest fee , I can tell you where he might be found . Eladio . Stop ! Don 't touch him . Hey ! I lost him ! More goats . Agent Lozano ... how does this man keep eluding us ? These people are invisible . You look at them , and you don 't see them . Just workers- - cheap labor to pick crops and clean houses . To most people , they are aliens in the true sense of the word . Ay , chupacabra . Okay , calm down . Calm down . Can a man do this ? Can Eladio Buente do this ? Eladio- - he went to his cousin Gabrielle 's house asking for money . - When ? - Today . He said he kill nobody . But , Soledad- - he went to Gabrielle 's house trying to kill Eladio . Calm down . ¿ Quien es ? Gabrielle Buente ? This is Agent Lozano , INS . Open up . Where is he ? ¿ Que ? Don 't give me your que . You know who . Where is he- - Eladio ? He is not here , please . I would not let Eladio Buente in here . Please , you must believe me . Maybe you should check the back . What about his brother , Soledad ? No . He 's not here ! No one is here ! I 'm alone ! Have you seen either of them ? Si . But I 'm afraid because of what they say about Eladio . About el chupacabra . There is no el chupacabra , Gabrielle . Eladio is a very sick man . If he comes here , you must not let him in . If he comes to this door , you must call the police . Do you understand ? There 's nobody . I 'm going to be watching you , chiquita , every move . ¿ Comprendes ? Si . I think we should hold up a minute . For what ? Something 's going on here . Hey , Jose , this ain 't no restaurant ! You know you have to pay for all that . Hey ! What the hell you think you 're doing ? ! Come back here ! Hey , you 're going to have to clean that up ! Hey ! That 's our man . Eladio Buente ? No , that 's his brother , Soledad . Bueno . Eladio ? Si , Gabrielle . Eladio ? Soledad Buente ! Stop , stop ! - Drop your weapon ! - Drop the gun ! - Drop it ! - ¡ Fuetala ! Put it down ! Now ! ¡ Apurate ! - Drop it ! - ¡ Fuetala ! ¡ Solo quiero vengarme , pues ! Eladio ! Mulder . He 's been here . ¿ Quien es ? Eladio . Eladio ? No . Mira . No . No ! No ! No ! Eladio ? Eladio Buente ? He 's not here . He 's gone . Gone where ? To Mexico ... where he can hide his terrible face ! How 's he going to get to Mexico ? I gave him all my money . You gave him your money ? Yes , because I was afraid . I was afraid the chupacabra would kill me , too . What can I say ? How are we going to find this man ? Good luck . I 'm going to go process the brother . You know , what she said about Eladio Buente , about his face ... I don 't know what to believe anymore , Scully . These people sure love their stories . Mulder , he could be anywhere right now . If he were to enter a metropolitan area with what he 's carrying ... He won 't . If he 's going to Mexico ... She 's lying . If this man really thinks he killed Maria Dorantes , he won 't be going to Mexico . Then where is he going ? The same place Agent Lozano and Eladio 's brother are going . He 's going to face his brother . I don 't understand . " God curses the man who stands between two brothers . " Get on your cell phone and have a hazmat team assemble . Eladio Buente ! Come on out ! Be a man and face your brother ! Madre de Dios . Eladio , no ! Y me dicho la chupacabra . They came from the sky . More chupacabras coming to save Eladio . I slammed the door and prayed that they would not come to kill me , too . What will happen to Soledad ? He was taken up by a chupacabra . He will suffer for his treachery . He 's made to suck the blood of only the sick and dying goats when the chupacabra comes to feed . But that 's not what Gabrielle said . What does Gabrielle know ? ! I was there . I saw it with my own eyes . Gabrielle said that she lied to la FBI , so that her cousin Eladio might live . But la migra Lozano knew Soledad could not live with vengeance in his heart . ¡ Alto ! Turn around and face the man whose love you killed ! You killed Maria because she wouldn 't love you- - because her heart belongs to only one man . Don 't make me shoot you in the back , Eladio ! Turn ! See my tears ! Turn around like a man ! No . " Shoot ! Shoot ! " la migra shouted , but Soledad began to cry . " No ! No ! " cried Soledad . " I cannot shoot my brother ! " He is my brother . My flesh , my blood . " Shoot him ! He 's el chupacabra ! ... shouted la migra . Cannot let him go ! " He is the goatsucker , and he must be killed ! " But , Soledad- - he could not kill Eladio because he knew I would never forgive him . - ¡ Cobarde ! - No , no ! La migra Lozano tried to pull the gun from Soledad 's hand , calling him a coward ! " No ! " cried Soledad . " He is my brother ! " And the gun went off ! Bang ! Bang ! And la migra Lozano fell dead . ¡ Pero , no ! La migra Lozano brought Soledad to kill Eladio so that he would not be cursed . So , God ... cursed Soledad for his treachery and turned him ... into a chupacabra like his brother . No . Together , they run ... to Mexico . El chupacabra ? Yes , sir . Frankly , I 'm confused by this story . I don 't blame you . We can 't exactly explain it ourselves , sir . At any rate , we arrived just after the hazmat team . They established a perimeter that secured the area . An eyewitness was found , but her testimony was questionable . The hazmat team were able to contain the fungal infection within the migrant camp . No other casualties were reported , and we found no other traces of the accelerating enzyme . Except on the body of Agent Lozano . We found him dead at the scene with a bullet wound to the chest . And with the fungal infection already starting to eat away at him . What happened to the brothers ? They were nowhere to be found . Lozano 's revolver turned up ten miles away , near the car of a man known locally as " El Barbera . " Apparently , the brothers paid this man for a ride to Mexico , but they didn 't get very far . So these men are still at large carrying a highly contagious fungus that can kill a man in his tracks ? It 's not a fungus , sir . Actually , it 's an enzyme , to which the brothers had an abnormal tolerance , and which came from what I believe to be an anti-enzyme gene . And this enzyme came from where ? Outer space , sir . So this is the story you 're asking me to report ? You would think with the resources we have , we 'd be able to find these men . I 'm not hearing a good explanation why this hasn 't happened . Well , sir , they , um ... they have a way of being almost invisible . The truth is nobody cares . I made this !

 Quiet ! Quiet ! Listen tome . It was a terrible thing . You are not going to believe me , even when I tell you . Some say it is a story , a fairy tale . But I saw it . I saw it with my own eyes . - Maria , mi amor . - Hey . Gracias . - No . - Si . - No . Let 's go ! - Si . - No . - Maria ! Mm-hmm . La cabras . Maria ! Maria ! Maria . Maria ! Madre de Dios . Mulder , this happened how long ago ? Tres dias . Muy increible , ? no ? Only the smell . You brought me out here under the pretense of investigating an unexplained death . Can you tell me why we 're standing out here in a field looking at a dead goat ? According to eyewitnesses , the death we 're investigating was preceded by a fortean event : a highly unusual or infrequent meteorological phenomenon , also known as a transient . - A transient ? - Yeah . Witnesses described a bright flash about 30 degrees off the horizon . Then a hot , yellow rain fell from a cloudless sky . Fortean researchers call these liquid falls . Black and red rains are common , but there have also been reported cases of blue , purple and green rains . - Purple rain ? - Yeah . Great album . Deeply flawed movie , though . Mulder , this transient , as you call it , this bright flash in the sky , I assume you think it has some connection to ... Fortean events have been linked to alien encounters . Cattle mutilations . The kind of exsanguinated animal carcass you were looking at . The victim , Maria Dorantes ... Did she die in a similar fashion ? - I would assume so . - You assume ? Nobody 's examined the body ? Nobody cares , Scully . The victim and many witnesses are illegal immigrants , migrant farm workers . I thought it might be important to talk to them before they migrated . No , no . Nolamigra . Nolamigra . - Nolamigra . - Nolamigra . Nolamigra . We 're FBI . Nolamigra . It 's all right . We don 't want to take anybody away . Relax . - No , it 's okay . Tranquila . - What do you want ? We want to know what happened to Maria Dorantes . Does anybody know what happened to Maria Dorantes ? - Did anybody see anything ? - El Chupacabra . That 's what happened to Maria Dorantes . - EI Chupacabra ? - Yeah , it 's a Mexican folktale . EI Chupacabra , the goat sucker . It 's a small , gray creature ... with a big head and a small body and big , black bulging eyes . Si , si , si . Light , then rain . Then EI Chupacabra , it comes and eats away Maria 's eyes and face . Did you see the Chupacabra ? No , but everyone here knows that this is the truth . This woman 's a liar . There is no Chupacabra . Chupacabra 's nothing but a story told to children . I know the killer of Maria Dorantes . - Who would that be , sir ? - It 's my brother . Eladio Buente . He killed Maria because she loved only me . Uh , how do you explain the yellow rain then , the dead goat over the hill ? It is a trick ... for fools who believe in fool superstitions . Thank you , Mr. Buente . You 've been very helpful . Maria , Maria . I 've just met a girl named Maria . - Doesn 't make a whole lot of sense , Scully . - Makes perfect sense . Admit it , you fell for it . Your fortean event turned out to be nothing more than the oldest story in the world . Two men , one woman , trouble . I admit there 's a strong suspicion of motive and intent . But the amount of detail , the description of that Chupacabra . Mulder , what we 've walked into here is a Mexican soap opera , and one for the local cops . Local cops don 't care , Scully . I don 't know who does . Okay , I care , but what are we supposed to do about it ? Find out what killed Maria Dorantes . Take a look at her body . - While you do what ? - Try to find this man , Eladio Buente . Agent Lozano ? I 'm Special Agent Mulder . I 'm with the FBI . The FBI , here ? - We 're investigating the death of a migrant worker . - Really . I 'm looking for a man named Eladio Buente . He hasn 't been seen for three days , and he 's not in police custody . I thought he might be in I.N.S. custody . He might . Let 's see . Okay , we have a Jose Feliciano . We have Juan Valdez . We have Cesar Chavez . We have Placido Domingo here . But I don 't see any Eladio Buente . So you are telling me that no one here uses their real name . What is this man wanted for ? Possibly the murder of a woman named Maria Dorantes . Oh , man . The Chupacabra ? Yeah . You 've heard of it . You don 't believe it . No , I believe these people . Hey , their lives are small . So they have to make these fantasies to keep on going , to feel alive . Because they are strangers here . They feel hated , unwanted . Whenever their passions become inflamed they resort to violence , and then they cannot turn to the law so they make up these fantastic tales . Call it anything you want , but this is an age-old story . I 've heard that . Let me see if we can find your Eladio Buente . Excuse me . - Excuse me . - Can I help you ? I 'm Agent Dana Scully with the FBI . - I 'm investigating the death of a migrant worker . - Juan or Juanita ? - I 'm sorry ? - Doe . A man or a woman ? A woman named Maria Dorantes . I need to determine a cause of death ... in order to close out an investigation . It sounds vaguely familiar , but I don 't think I 've been able to get to her yet . I 'm a medical doctor . If you show me the body , I can examine it myself . It 's in the fridge . I don 't think he 's going anywhere . That 's her . Oh , my God . This must be him . Why is he segregated like this ? He said the other detainees were giving him a hard time , causing trouble . They don 't want to go near him . - They think he 's the Chupacabra . - That may be . I will tell you with a tremendous degree of certainty this guy is not Erik Estrada . Buente ! Ask him if he killed Maria Dorantes . No ! - What 'd he say ? - " I didn 't do it . " Ask him what happened . There was a noise like thunder , but very close . Then there was lightning , very bright . It blinded me . I fell to the ground . And then I felt the hot rain fall on me . And when I finally could open my eyes and see , I saw the dead goat . And then I saw Maria ... Maria . She called my name ... once . She was lying in puddle of yellow rain . Something had eaten at her face . And I held her in my arms , and then she died . And then I got up , and I ran screaming . This guy is better than Erik Estrada . What 's gonna happen to him ? He 'll get his 45 seconds before the judge and placed on a southbound bus . - Is there anyway to delay that ? - Why would you do that ? - To solve an unexplained death . - I think the FBI 's got better things to do . File your paperwork . By the time they process it , he 'll probably be back here anyway . - Put him in the front . - Come on . Up front . Okay , vamos . Let 's go . - Did you find Eladio Buente ? - Yeah , I found him . Did he confess to the murder of Maria Dorantes ? Not exactly , no . Did he tell you what happened ? Flash of light , yellow rain . " Maria ! Maria ! " He didn 't kill her , Mulder . I examined the body of Maria Dorantes , and I believe that her cause of death was natural , albeit strange . - She seems to have succumbed to massive fungal infection . - A fungus ? Aspergillus , according to the coroner . It 's a mold that 's found in dead leaves , compost , even household dust . - And it can kill ? - Not normally . It 's very common and harmless . - You don 't think that 's weird ? - Aspergillus can be lethal ... to people with immunodeficiencies ... Like AI DS patients and transplant recipients . I found high levels of methylbromide in her blood workup . It 's a pesticide that 's used for soil sterilization ... highly toxic . Now , I think that her body was so ravaged by pesticides ... that a normally benign fungus may have compromised her whole immune system . Still doesn 't explain the flash of lightning and the yellow rain ... and EI Chupacabra . Mulder , I know you don 't want to hear this . I think the aliens in this story are not the villains . They 're the victims . Look at that . Mulder . - Be right there . - All right . What does it look like ? This man died of systemic shock brought on by what appears to be another fungal infection . The same fungus that killed Maria Dorantes ? No . It looks dissimilar . I don 't know what this is . Its speed and its aggressiveness are frightening . The infection 's covered 90 % of his body , Mulder , through both layers of skin . - Did you find him ? - We were able to run down most of the people who escaped . But Eladio Buente wasn 't among them . No one knows where he ran ? - Agent Lozano , this is my partner , Agent Scully . - Hi . They all ran the other way , away from EI Chupacabra , the man they say is responsible for this tragedy . Eladio Buente didn 't kill this man . He didn 't kill anybody . - I 'm not so sure about that . - This is the work of a pathogen of a highly virulent strain . I 'm not questioning that , but right now Eladio Buente is the only connection we have ... to this death and the death of Maria Dorantes . Which is why I need you to spare any manpower you can to try to find him . Manpower ? We don 't have the resources to go chasing after one poor illegal . Mulder , whatever you hope to learn by finding this man , we have to first make a definitive classification of the fungi from the victims . I need to isolate it , and I need to get a sample to a mycologist . Good . You should do that while Agent Lozano and I try to find EI Chupacabra . ? Senor ? - Senor ? - What do you want ? You want to go back ? ? Estas loco ? We haul mucha basura with that truck . What makes you think we haul it back ? How long have you been in this country ? Aquí es America , you dumb wet . Truck stop at dusk . No dinero , no ride . - ? Comprende ? - Si . - Dinero . - Dinero . The truck 's here ! Construction workers . Dos . Okay , two of you . You two , get in the back . Let 's go . I only need two , amigo . Dos . Hey , outta the truck . I got work to do . Hey , where are you going ? You 'll have to do . What you 're looking at , Agent Scully , is the most ubiquitous fungal spore known to mankind ... derma tuffatosis . Athlete 's foot ? One of the great survivors of countless extermination efforts . Historically underrated and unfairly overshadowed by the ever-popular cockroach . Our body has natural defenses against this kind of invasion . Even in the absence of an immuno response , a fungi like this one ... or the aspergillus sample I gave you ... don 't they need the right environment to multiply ? Yes , unless they have help . - What 's this ? - It 's an enzyme lisolated from both your specimens . That 's about all I can tell ya . It 's unlike any enzyme I 've ever seen . So it 's not the fungi but the enzyme that kills . Acting as a catalyst , as an accelerant . Let me show you . This is pecunia graminus , black stem rust . It 's been the cause of a fairly containable crop blight here in the valley . Oh , my God . I must say , if this were to get out into the environment , derma tuffatosis might give the cockroach run for its money . Hmm ? He was here , all right . They say he got into a truck of a foreman named Culver . Story 's out . Oh , yeah . I told you , these people love their stories . It 's the one thing that keeps them from going mad ... when they 're out there standing on the street corner all day waiting for work . - So they really don 't think he 's the Chupacabra ? - No , they 're certain of it . - Did you tell them about the fungal infection ? - Yeah , they wouldn 't listen . They are only interested in what will become of Eladio Buente . - What will become of him ? - When his brother finds him ... - He 'll kill him . - Yes , probably . A man cannot live with vengeance in his heart . So we gotta find him first . My mother used to say that blood should be left to cleanse itself . God curses the man who stands between two brothers . Well , in this case , He 'll curse the man who doesn 't . ♪ Senor ♪ ♪ Senor ♪ Senor Culver ? Eladio Buente . Eladio ? Eladio Buente . Gabrielle ! Gabrielle ! Eladio ! - Mulder , it 's me . - Hey , Scully , where are you ? The state university bio department . Mulder , listen to me . I think you 're right . - I think Eladio Buente is responsible for those deaths . - Responsible how ? By spreading an enzyme produced by what appears to be a new strain of conidial fungi . - How 's he spreading it ? - My guess is by touch . Now , I saw this man , Scully . He was unaffected . He could be just a carrier then , a kind of Typhoid Maty . - You 're saying it 's a new strain ? - Yes . It is extremely important that you not come into direct contact with this fungus . - You must not inhale it . You must not touch it . - Lozano , careful , man . Scully , I 've been thinking . I know that 's dangerous , but just bear with me . These fortean transients ... what the woman described ... they could have been caused by an object falling at a high rate of speed ... creating a sonic boom and a flash of light astronomers call a bolide . - A bolide ? - Created by a meteorite ... or a piece of extra-planetarium material , of which 2,000 tons falls to the earth every day . This yellow rain ... Space debris could have fallen in a nearby lake , superheating the water and sending it skyward , which would mean this is alien . - I think this is beside the point right now . - Oh , and the fungus ... Let me work on the fungus . What you need to do is to find the man who may be spreading it . Okay . So you got your own stories too , huh ? Hey , it 's EI Barbero . Hey , Lozano , I hear you 're lookin for the Chupacabra . For a modest fee , I can tell you where he might be found . Eladio ! Stop ! Don 't touch him . Hey ! I lost him . More goats . Agent Lozano , how does this man keep eluding us ? These people are invisible . You look at them and you don 't see them . Just workers , cheap labor to pick crops and clean houses . To most people , they 're aliens in the true sense of the word . - EI Chupacabra . EI Chupacabra . - Calm down . - Calm down . - Chupacabra . Can a man do this ? Can Eladio Buente do this ? Eladio , he went to his cousin Gabrielle 's house asking for money . - When ? - Today . He said he killed nobody . But Soledad , he went to Gabrielle 's house trying to kill Eladio . Calm down . - ? Quien es ? - Gabrielle Buente ? This is Agent Lozano , I.N.S. Open up . - Where is he ? - ? Que ? Don 't give me your " que . " You know who . - Where is he , Eladio ? - He is not here . I would not let Eladio Buente in here . Please , you must believe me . Maybe you should check the back . What about his brother , Soledad ? No . He is not here ! No one is here ! I 'm alone . Have you seen either of them ? Si . But I 'm afraid because of what they say about Eladio . About EI Chupacabra . There is no EI Chupacabra , Gabrielle . Eladio is a very sick man . If he comes here , you must not let him in . If he comes to this door , you must call the police . Understand ? There 's nobody . I 'm going to be watching you , Chiquita . Every move . - ? Comprendes ? - Si . - I think we should hold up a minute . - For what ? Something 's going on here . Hey , Jose , this ain 't no restaurant ! You know you have to pay for all that . Hey , what the hell do you think you 're doing ? Comeback here ! Hey , you 're gonna have to clean that up . Hey ! - That 's our man . - Eladio Buente ? No . That 's his brother , Soledad . ? Bueno ? - Eladio ? - Si , Gabrielle . Eladio ? Eladio ! Soledad Buente . Stop ! Stop ! Drop you weapon ! Drop the gun ! put it down ! Now ! Drop it ! Eladio ! Mulder . He 's been here . ? Quien es ? - Eladio . - Eladio ? No . No . No ! No ! Eladio ? Eladio Buente ? He is not here . He 's gone . - Gone where ? - To Mexico , where he can hide his terrible face . - How 's he gonna get to Mexico ? - I gave him all my money . - You gave him your money ? - Yes , because I was afraid . I was afraid EI Chupacabra will kill me too . What can I say ? How are we gonna find this man ? Good luck . I 'm gonna go process the brother . You know what she said about Eladio Buente , about his face ? I don 't know what to believe . These people love their stories . Mulder , he could be anywhere right now . If he were to enter a metropolitan area with what he 's carrying ... - He won 't . - If he 's going to Mexico ... If this man really thinks he killed Maria Dorantes , he won 't be going to Mexico . - Then where is he going ? - The same place Lozano and Eladio 's brother are going . - He 's gone to face his brother . - I don 't understand . " God curses a man who stands between two brothers . " Get on your cell phone and have a Haz-Mat team assembled . Eladio Buente , come on out ! - Be a man and face your brother . - Madre de Dios . Eladio , no ! He believed in EI Chupacabra . They came from the sky . More Chupacabras ... coming to save Eladio . I slammed the door and prayed ... that they would not come to kill me too . What will happen to Soledad ? He was taken up by a Chupacabra . He will suffer for his treachery . He 's made to suck the blood ... of only the sick and dying goats ... when the Chupacabra comes to feed . - That 's not what Gabriella said . - What does Gabriella know ? I was there . I saw it with my own eyes . Gabriella said that she lied to la FBI ... so that her cousin , Eladio , might live . But lamigra Lozano knew that Soledad could not live with vengeance in his heart . Turn around and face the man whose love you killed ! You killed Maria ... because she wouldn 't love you . Because her heart belongs to only one man . Don 't make me shoot you in the back , Eladio . Turn ! See my tears ! - Turn around like a man ! - No . " Shoot . Shoot ! " lamigra shouted . But Soledad began to cry . " No . No ! " cried Soledad . " I cannot shoot my brother . He is my brother . My flesh , my blood . " - Shoot him ! He 's EI Chupacabra ! - Shouted lamigra . - You cannot let him go ! - " He is a goat sucker , and he must be killed ! " Soledad , he could not kill Eladio ... because he knew I would never forgive him . - No ! No ! - Amiga Lozano ... tried to pull the gun from Soledad 's hand , calling him a coward ! " No ! He is my brother ! " And the gun went off ! Bang ! Bang ! Lamigra Lozano fell dead . perono . La migra Lozano ... brought Soledad to kill Eladio ... so that he would not be cursed . So God ... cursed Soledad for his treachery ... and turned him into ... EI Chupacabra like his brother . No . Together they run ... to Mexico . - EI Chupacabra ? - Yes , sir . Frankly , I 'm confused by this story . I don 't blame you . We can 't exactly explain it ourselves , sir . At any rate , we arrived just after the Haz-Mat team . They established perimeter then secured the area . An eyewitness was found , but her testimony was questionable . The Haz-Mat team were able to contain the fungal infection within the camp . No other casualties were reported . We found no other traces of the accelerating enzyme . Except on the body of Agent Lozano . We found him dead at the scene with a bullet wound to the chest . And with the fungal infection already starting to eat away at him . What happened to the brothers ? They were nowhere to be found . Lozano 's revolver turned up ten miles away ... near the car of a man known locally as EI Barbero . Apparently , the brothers paid this man for a ride to Mexico , but they didn 't get very far . So these men are still at large carrying a highly contagious fungus ... that can kill a man in his tracks ? It 's not a fungus , sir . Actually , it 's an enzyme ... to which the brothers had an abnormal tolerance . And which came from what I believe to be an anti-enzyme gene . - This enzyme came from where ? - Outer space , sir . So this is the story you 're asking me to report ? You would think with the resources we have , we 'd be able to find these men . I 'm not hearing a good explanation why this hasn 't happened . Well , sir , they , um ... They have a way of ... being almost invisible . The truth is , nobody cares .

Alert ! Alert ! Please enter more coins . One minute playing time to go . Aren 't you gonna see what happens next ? - Later . Oh hi . Hey guys . Where have you been ? - One word , sale . Excuse me , but I am captain of the gymnastics team . We had a meet . So , what have you been doing galactic warrior ? Prepare ... Hey ! What 's going on ? - You just got blown away . Homer , no ! Homer ! Jake ! We already paid for another 20 minutes ! Come on boy , let 's go ! Looks like those obedience classes are paying off . What 's up with him anyway ? - I don 't know , but we gotta get him back . Homer , where are you going ? Homer ! Come here ! Homer stop ! This isn 't funny ! What 's he want there ? Homer ! This place creeps me out . Hey guys , it 's getting late . We 've looked everywhere . He 's not here . - We 've got to find him . Come on Homer ! Come on ! Let 's go boy.Homer ! Over here . Homer ! Over here boy . Come on boy ! Over here ! Do you see him ? - No . Nah man . Let 's go ! Come on Homer . Come on . Hey ! He 's over here . He seems okay now . Hey . Thanks . - Sure . Come here Homer . Come on . Good boy . You 're new around here , right ? - Look . Whoa . - Look at that ! Too weird . - Come on . Let 's go . - I don 't think so . What if someone 's hurt ? - She 's right . I 'm in . You 're insane . Alright , wait up . There 's something coming out . This is the part where we hide amigo . What is it ? I don 't know , but it 's definitely not from my ' hood . What are you doing ? - It looks like it 's hurt ! Yeah , so ? - So we have to help it . What if it 's like , radioactive or something ? - Oh please . Stay . - Oh sure . The dog gets to stay . Maybe we should try talking to it . Yeah . Just let me get out my Alien / English dictionary . Do not be afraid . I mean you no harm . Where did that come from ? I heard it , but I didn 't hear it . I heard it . In my head . We all heard it . - I 'm speaking to you in thoughts . You 're hurt . We can help you . I am Elfangor of the Andalite world . I 've come .. Jake give me you 're shirt . He 's wounded . There 's nothing you can do for me . It 's going to be okay . Cassie knows a lot about animals . Way to insult the guy Rach . The wound is fatal . I will die . But there will be others . - Others ? Unlike me , they have come to destory you . There is no time for fear . You must help your world . But you must protect yourself from the yeerks . - The what ? The yeerks , they are ... . The yeerks are parasites . They must have a host to live in . On Earth their hosts are humans . They enter your brain and take over your thoughts and feelings . These hosts are called controllers . They can be anyone , your family , your friends . Earth is their next target . Wait a second , you 're telling me that some slimy alien slug can crawl into our brains and take over our minds ? - And control us ? - Yes . There is no time for questions . I must do what I can do for you . I have no choice . I can give you a way to fight the yeerks . Each of you must touch one side of the cube . I 'm not touching that . If you don 't then everything that you love will be destroyed ... your brothers , your sisters , your parents .. Rachel , I don 't know . You heard him . We have no choice . Man this is insane . This gift is for you too Tobias . How do you know my name ? Hurry . Now what ? Something 's wrong . It is done . The power of change is in your flesh . Change ? What kind of change ? You need only to touch a creature to acquire it 's DNA pattern and change your form . Change our form ? - You mean we can change into animals ? Exactly . You can become any animal you touch and acquire . But remember , when you change : you must return to your human form within two earth hours . Why ? What happens after two hours ? You will be trapped in that animal form forever . Let 's going out ... - What 's happening ? Visser Three is here . - What 's a Visser Three ? You must go . Go ! Your lives are more important than mine now . Go ! Go ! Guard this Tobias , with your heart and your soul . Tobias , come on . - I have to get it . It 's another one . - No , this one 's different . I 'm guessing that 's Visser Three . Prince Elfangor . What an honor it is to be in the presence a legend . You managed to trick quite a few of our fighters . Visser Three . Yes , I have taken one of your Andalite bodies as my host . Your Andalite morphing technology has been so very useful to me . No matter how many bodies you steal , you will not win this war . We will fight you . You and your Andalite army are fighting on too many fronts . Your forces are spread too thin . This world will soon be ours . Why Earth ? Why these people ? Because there are so many , and they are so weak . Our army will be a billion strong . And then I promise you one thing Elfangor . I will return to your world and personally oversee the infestation of your entire family . I hope they resist so that I can hear their minds scream . You will not take me . There will be others . No ! Hey , you there ! They 've seen us ! Over there . Tell Visser Three we have a problem . - Okay . Release the Hork-Bajir . Come on Homer , come on , let 's go . What 's that ? Hang around and find out ? - No thanks . I 'll read the book . Cassie 's stuck . Hey , hey ! Over here ! Hey stupid ! Over here ! Jake , no ! - Come on ! I 'm right here . Come on ! Let s go . Oh , Great . Homer ! Homer , come here ! Come on , come here boy , come on . Keep looking they have to be somewhere . We lost them in the woods . - Then go after them . One of them is still here . Track him down or answer to Visser Three . Right . Incompetence . Over here ! I think I see something . I need your help Homer . Did you find them ? - No sir , just a couple of dogs . Get those dogs you fool . They might be andalites . Last night , when I got home and I called Jake . He didn 't answer . He 's smart . He 'll show up . Hey Tobias ! You know .. funniest thing happened to me last night . Some blue dude with four legs put me and a few other idiots in charge of saving the world . Quiet.You want somebody to hear you ? What happened if that thing got him ? It didn 't . Listen . I did it . I mean it works . I became Homer last night . That 's how I got away . No way . You 're serious ? It was so bizarre . I was trapped . I had no other choice and I remembered what the alien said , so I put my hand on Homer and I started concentrating . All of the sudden I started .. mutating .. I could hear my bones crunching and twisting . I watched my palms become paws . I became my dog . You were Homer ? Actually a copy . I mean Homer was there too . Did it hurt ? No , not really . I mean , It 's hard to explain . At first I didn 't know what I was . I could hear everything .. and the smells .. You don 't believe me do you ? No , we do . It 's just ... it 's just too weird . No .. beyond too weird . - Way beyond . I swear . It 's true . I mean I keep thinking I 'm going to wake up and this is all going to be a dream . But it 's not , what we saw last night was real . It happened right ? - Yeah . It happened . So now what ? We save the world ? Can we eat first ? No kidding . What do we do ? Where do we start ? How ' bout that blue dude ? You know , the nice one ? - Elfangor . Yeah , he tried to give you something . - What was it ? It looked like some kind of disk or something . Its gotta be important . He said to guard it with my heart and my soul . He knew your name . How come ? Like I know ? He 's probably telepathic or something . But that disk ... I mean it 's gotta be able to help us somehow . We gotta get it back . - Are you kidding me ? They practically got us on the FBI 's ten most wanted list . Didn 't you hear the news ? Yeah , they 're looking for some kids who set off fireworks . Fireworks ? Now that 's a laugh . They 're lying . - Maybe they 've got yeerks in their heads . That means the yeerks could be anywhere . If they saw our faces , they would have caught us by now . We can 't talk here . Anyone could be one of them . A controller . Is anyone going to rein in this chaos or do I have to do everything myself ? I 'm sorry Mr. Chapman . - Incompetence . Guys , come here . From now on , we just talk to each other . Trust no one . Principal Chapman 's a controller . Five of us against an army of alien slugs , and anyone could be one of them .

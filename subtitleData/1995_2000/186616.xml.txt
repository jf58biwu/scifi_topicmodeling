 ( Rembrandt ) Wish we could 've stayed another day on Cajun world . Nothing against this one , but , hey , vive la difference ! Right , fellas ? Man , do I love Mardi Gras . And women on balconies . Yeah . I 'm glad that Napoleon never met his Waterloo because I got to meet Cindy . Come here , lover boy , I don 't think it 's your shade . ( Wade ) I don 't know about you guys , but I 'm in need of some serious z 's . ( Professor ) Yes . Positively soporific idea , Miss Wells . And how about Miss Wells' broken heart , eh ? He 's gonna be pretty surprised when I don 't come back from the bathroom . [ All laugh ] ( Professor ) Hey , you idiot ! It says no bike riding here ! [ Grunts ] ( skater ) Hey ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? There 's no bikes allowed here . ( skater ) Oh , no . Please , don 't ... d-don 't ... don 't hurt me . It was an accident . All right . I-I-I 'll do anything you say . Anything you say . All right . Drop dead . [ People chattering ] He 's having a seizure . ( Quinn ) Keep him from biting his tongue . I 've got his legs . [ Skater gasping ] Will somebody call an ambulance ! Please ! Remmy , there 's some cops . [ Choking ] This is Weber . I need an ambulance at the pier . Uh , cancel that . Send the meat wagon . No , it appears to be self-inflicted . Better list it as a suicide . ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . The two kids on the cycles were behaving irresponsibly . They barged into my friend here and then they ... they totaled that poor fellow . Anybody got anything else to say ? Yeah . You should be talking to those two clowns over there . How stupid are you ? You want to get somebody else killed ? [ Seagull cawing ] Wait a minute . It wasn 't a suicide . Leave the park now . You 've been warned . That 's all I can do . I used to draw on my hand , too , but that was in the fourth grade . Don 't you know what this hand can do ? Not as much as this one . I can 't wait to sleep with you . [ Grunts ] You . You shouldn 't have done that . If you don 't leave now , I 'm gonna do a lot more . I 'll take care of you later . You , I 'll see you in your dreams . Are you all right ? Yeah . ( Wade ) I know what I saw . What you saw were neck spasms and the resultant angina induced by an epileptic fit . Something was choking him . You 're suggesting that these guys have the power of psychokinesis ? I don 't know . Maybe . ( Quinn ) Wade , we 're all a little tired . I think you 're just seeing things . We all saw somebody die . And it wasn 't a suicide . Are you crazy ? Give me that ! Is there a problem ? You never know what 's gonna set off one of them Dream Masters . Dream Masters ? Is that what they 're called ? Have you had trouble with them ? A Dream Master got my last cocktail waitress . Got her ? How ? Man , nobody can stay awake forever . Nobody . And once you 're asleep , that 's when they enter your dreams and create nightmares . Tell us something about those guys . Are they ... Shh . We shouldn 't be talking about this . All right , guys . We 're all set . The creep from the park , I just saw him . ( Professor ) I don 't see him , Miss Wells . ( Quinn ) Wade , there 's nobody there . It was him . ( Rembrandt ) Girl , you need some sleep . I 'm not going to sleep . You don 't think for a moment ... He said he 'd see me in my dreams . Wade , that 's impossible . Yeah ? Why is everybody so afraid of them ? Well , I 'm not afraid of him . Good . You go with Wade , stay with her in the room while Remmy and I do a little recon . Checkmate . Hey , Q-Ball , why don 't we just get on out of town , leave these geeks behind ? Because if they can invade a person 's dreams , running away won 't do any good . Yeah . Well , you think they can ? I think we better find out . Diggs , where do these Dream Masters hang out ? Still awake ? You kidding ? Every time I close my eyes , I see that guy 's face . Well , I don 't suppose that reading this is helping . " She felt his rough hands " tug at the ribbon of her silk blouse . " She was aroused as never before . She could feel a ... " Miss Wells , what rubbish . [ Sighs ] Why don 't you just shut your eyes and go to sleep now , eh ? I shall be over there . If you need anything , just call . Come on now . ( Henry ) Here we go . ( Quinn ) Excuse me . I want you to give your buddy a message for me . Sure . Always happy to grant a final request . Tell him we 're only in town for a couple of days . And we don 't want any trouble , although he was still out of line . ( Henry ) Yeah . Sure . And so was the little bitch that hit him . ( Byron ) Easy , Henry . She 'll get what she deserves . Look , I just want you to know that if anything happens to her or any of my friends , you 're gonna have to deal with me , okay ? Well , I guess we 'll be seeing a lot of each other then . Is that a threat ? Yes , it is . [ Car honking ] Come on , Henry . Come on . [ Police siren wailing ] Hi . How long to get a pot of coffee sent up ? That long ? It is . Thanks . [ Music playing ] I 'm here with some friends . Saw you come in . You mind if I join you ? Yes , I do . It 's , uh , it 's Wade , isn 't it ? Very unusual name . The desk clerk at the hotel thought so , too . [ People chattering ] Winsome Wade , huh ? Wonderful Wade . Not-very-wise Wade . Please , just leave me alone . You know , you intrigue me . Really . It 's , uh , not very often that a woman defies me . And I ... I ... I find that stimulating . Don 't touch me ! [ Clears throat ] [ All chattering ] [ Panting ] Hurry , Miss Wells . It 's too soon ! W-we 're not supposed to slide until tomorrow . It 's our only hope . Run ! [ Exclaims ] Sorry , Wade . You can 't leave me ! [ Screams ] We 're here , Wade . Wake up . Wake up . She 's cut bad . She 's not cut . There 's not a mark on her . Well , what we 're witnessing here is some form of psychotropically-induced stigmata . You think if we hadn 't woken her up , she would 've bled to death ? Quite possibly , yes . Whatever it is , that guy must have had some kind of drug on his hand . Now , Wade did say that when he touched her , she felt a tingling sensation . Now there are drugs that will produce vivid hallucinations that can be administered through the skin . You really think he was able to enter her dream ? Or perhaps he planted a hypnotic suggestion in the bar . In any event , Wade believes that he will invade her dreams . And if she falls asleep again , he will return . It 's kind of like if someone tells you not to think about the elephant , but then , that 's all you can think of . How long is it till we slide ? About 30 hours . How you gonna keep her awake until then ? Human beings are capable of sustained periods of consciousness , Mr. Brown , provided that they have sufficient elephants ... [ exclaims ] Sufficient stimulation . We shall just take shifts to keep her occupied . [ Door closes ] Cold shower worked . I 'm wide awake . I 'm also freezing . Look , uh , maybe I should turn up the heat . No , no , no , it 'll make her drowsy . Uh , maybe there 's a hotel doctor and he can give me something to keep me awake , huh ? Only as a last resort . We have no way of knowing how the drugs of this world will act on our bodies . I can call room service and get you some orange juice and liver . Only as a last resort . No , no , listen , in the navy , when we gave blood , they would give us orange juice and tell us to go get a nice big piece of liver . That way it 'd help build up our iron . Can 't I just suck on some rusty nails ? [ Chuckling ] [ Sighs ] Are you all right ? Here , sit down . Yeah . There you go . Fine . She needs some fresh air . I 'm gonna open a window . No , no , no . Not in her weakened state . Guys . Look , man , we need some fresh air in here . I disagree . Guys . Guys ! When are you gonna go talk to the police ? We were just leaving . [ Sighs ] Don 't worry . We 're gonna find someone to stand up to these people . Don 't count on it . Excuse me , officers . You again ? We 'd like to know where can we lodge a formal complaint against these so-called Dream Masters ? Can 't help you , pal . There 's been an attempt made on the life of our friend . I want you two idiots to take a walk . Right now . You call yourself a police officer and you let those guys get away with scaring people to death ? Get out of here . Go ! Come on . Come . Hey ! We 've done nothing , officer . ( Weber ) Shut up . What , you 're giving us a ticket now ? I know a place you can take your friend . It 's a shelter for the victims of the Dream Masters . She 'll be safe there . Be careful , or they 'll come after you , too . Why are you helping us when no one else would ? ( Professor ) I know why . Because Officer Weber has been a victim of the Dream Masters herself . The shelter isn 't far from here . Good luck . Got a second ? Is that liver ? [ Sniffs ] Uhh . L ... I hate liver . [ People chattering ] Mmm . Shh . [ Whispers ] Not a word . Hurry up , before it gets cold . Sure . [ Shoos ] ( Olivia ) The hardest time is after dark . Because of their fear of falling asleep most of these patients suffer from chronic insomnia . ( Quinn ) They 're deprived of REM sleep ? To a point . Then they have a period of rebound and make up for it . So , it 's during REM sleep that the Dream Masters have the greatest powers to revisit them ? Yes . Actually , my husband experimented with some REM-blocking drugs , but they had too many side effects . Hmm . Damned if you dream , damned if you don 't . Eh ? Exactly . Without dreams , the subconscious has no release . Dr. Lujan , what happened to them ? They 're effectively in a coma . Some of them went up against the Dream Masters and this was their punishment . We 're hoping to find a way to bring them out of it one day . [ Monitor beeping ] ( Olivia ) Their systems were so shocked by the dream experience that they remain locked in this vegetative state . ( Quinn ) Has your husband continued his work on other REM blockers ? Right now this is all I can do . Would you like to see my husband 's lab ? So , how many times has he invaded her dreams ? Just once that we know of . And was he able to manifest any visible injuries ? Her wrists and hands were bleeding . Stage two . It may still be early enough to try some intervention . Sometimes we can make hypnotic suggestions before they enter REM . If we can reinforce the idea that it 's just a dream , it strengthens their ability to withstand the assault . ( Professor ) However did such a bunch of social misfits gain so much power ? About five years ago , a scientist named Cardoza began experimenting with lucid dreaming techniques . He used psychotropic drugs and co-hypnosis to invade other people 's consciousness . When the authorities at the university , including my husband , found out what he was doing , they tried to stop him . Cardoza was fired from the university . But several of his students left with him . They became the Dream Masters . Why doesn 't somebody just eliminate them ? Well , they have a vow to avenge any death . If you challenge them , you 're severely punished . My husband barely survived . Now , no one has the courage to go against them . Do you mind if we look at your husband 's papers ? There may be something there that we can use . No , not at all . That 's what he was working on . ( Wade ) They 're coming to get me ! [ Knocking on door ] Remmy . Wake up . [ Knocking continues ] Rembrandt ! Rembrandt ! Rembrandt ! [ Gagging ] [ Shrieking ] Wade ! Oh , no , no , no ! Where 'd that blood come from ? Rembrandt ! Wake up ! Mr. Brown , wake up ! ( Quinn ) Please , help her ! You 've got to help her ! What are you gonna do ? Adrenaline shock therapy . [ Grunts ] [ Gasping ] All right . Let 's get her to the clinic . Wade ? How could you let her down like that , Mr. Brown ? ( Olivia ) I 've got a stage two invasion . I administered adrenaline shock therapy about 20 minutes ago . B.P. Is falling , we need a transfusion . Use mine . I 'm O-negative . Start with him , then get a type and cross check on these guys . Stay with us . ( Olivia ) We need a crash cart in here . Intubate her . Let 's get a drip going . How is my prize pupil doing ? ( Gerald ) I 'm REM-ing very well . Thank you , Master Cardoza . I 've engaged a very nice young girl . She 's a real screamer . May I join the dream ? I 'd be honored , sir . ( Wade ) Help me , please ! [ Wade sobbing ] Help me . [ Voice laughing ] [ Voice screaming ] ( Professor ) Olivia , I think I 've found something . Your husband was suggesting treating the experience within the dream state itself by using the psychotropics present in the pentagrams on the Dream Masters ' hands . How are we supposed to get it ? Cut their hands off ? It 's a thought . [ Voices screaming ] [ Voice laughing ] [ Voice whispering ] [ Screaming ] ( Olivia ) She 's in arrest ! ( Quinn ) What can I do ? Set the dial to 100 . Clear ! Time of death : 8 : 42 , Pacific Coast time . You didn 't tell me she was in a shelter . I didn 't think it mattered , sir . It does . Dr. Lujan won 't give up so easily . She 's just like her husband . Clear ! [ Monitors beeping ] I got a heart beat . Thank God . Wake her up . No . It 's too soon for more adrenaline . He 's broken off contact . Is she gonna be all right ? ( Olivia ) I don 't know . Get away from her . She wouldn 't be in this mess if you 'd stayed awake . Sorry . Look , I don 't know what happened . [ Beeping continues ] ( Gerald ) Please , Master Cardoza . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . ( Cardoza ) You invite me into your dream and not complete it is bad form , Gerald . Perhaps you 're not the man I thought you were . But I am , sir . I am . Just tell me what it is you want me to do . I chose the pentagram as our symbol because it instills terror in all who see it . The reason , Gerald , that we have power over people is because they fear us . We enjoy a position in life that was once denied us because we weren 't hip , we weren 't popular . But if one survives an engagement and is not killed , or turned into a vegetable , then all of us , and what we are now , are threatened . Do you understand it ? Yes , sir . Then what are you gonna do to make this right ? Get rid of all of them , sir ? Perhaps there 's hope for you yet . Thank you , sir . Why was I showing off ? What ... what am I , stupid ? Bad timing . It happens . Yeah . But why in front of him , huh ? He 's giving you a second chance . I don 't know if I can take it . My head is ... My head is pounding ! I mean , I have such a headache . We 'll help you . We will ? Look , Gerald , you 're his favorite at the university . You 're next in line for the throne . This is a chance to prove yourself . Don 't screw up . Girls like her never used to pay any attention to me . Yeah , but they do now . She 's gonna be sorry that she wasn 't nice to me . Very sorry . Remember us when you 're the Master of Dreams . [ Blows ] Deal ? Deal . All right , let 's gather the other members . Let 's finish her . Hmm ? It 's gonna be our pleasure , sir . And , uh , gentlemen , let 's do something with razors . [ Monitor beeping ] We may have saved her for the moment , but they will be back . [ Exclaims ] Will she need more blood ? No . Not for now . Besides , you 've given all that you can . Let 's just , uh , see how she does . If we follow your husband 's advice , we 'll have to face them in the dream state to save Wade . How long will it take for you to fix what we need ? ( Olivia ) I 've got most of the chemicals here but we need scrapings from one of their hands . Where can we find some geeks at this time of night ? That club , a couple of blocks away . All right , let 's go . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Look , you 're not goin ' anywhere . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . ( Olivia ) No . You 're down a couple of pints . You need to rest . All right , my boy . You 're gonna have to do this by yourself . You go . We 'll get the lab ready for your return . Look , just don 't let any of ' em touch you . ( Quinn ) I 'll be back as fast as I can , Professor . Your friend Rembrandt couldn 't have donated blood , anyway . Why ? His system 's too full of Orphenene . What 's Orphenene ? It 's a sedative that the Dream Masters like to use . [ Door creaking ] ( man ) Psst ! [ Body thudding ] Mr. Brown . If Wade doesn 't make it , I mean , if she ends up like one of these guys , I 've decided to stay here and take care of her . I am so sorry . Oh , Mr. Brown . [ Sighs ] We all do things that we regret . You know , but this one tops my list . Well , falling asleep on duty is a heinous crime . However ... Wouldn 't have happened with you , though , would it ? No , it wouldn 't . You never screw up , do you ? Even when you 're wrong , you 've got to be right . That 's not true . So if you wanna blow hard with your big words , tell me how it 's my fault that Wade might die ? Go ahead , man . I don 't mind . Because it 'll be the last time that I 'll ever have to listen to one of your lectures . The reason why I would not have fallen asleep on duty is quite simple . I do not take coffee late at night . You were drugged ! I was ? Yes ! And if I do occasionally sound like the professor I am , it is because I enjoy teaching . I like seeing the light going on in people 's eyes the way it has just gone on in yours . Mr. Brown , I owe you an elephant ... Uh , an apology . Yeah . Yeah , all right , go ahead . I 'm sorry . I was hoping for something a little more like , " I 'm sorry that I thought the worst of you . I should have more faith in my friends . " I am sorry that I thought the worst of you . I should have more faith in my friends . " And I know that you love Wade as much as any of us " and would probably give your life to save hers if you could . " Ditto . " And then there are times ... " Don 't push your luck , Mr. Brown . [ Both laughing ] Hurry . They 're after her again ! The Dream Masters ? Yes . She 's fully engaged , level three . What about Q-Ball ? I don 't know , but he better get here soon . Shaman often carry a powerful object with them into the dream . It , uh , reminds them that they are in an altered state and that they have some control over the outcome . I 'd rather have a.45 with me . What is it you most fear , Mr. Brown ? Why are you asking me that ? Because that is what you can expect to encounter there . ( Professor ) Wade told me once that she 'd been mugged and threatened with a knife . That 's why she has a particular fear of being cut and bleeding . Thank God you 're here . I got it . We 've got to hurry . They 're ganging up on her . [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Why do you have to strap us in ? To keep you from hurting yourself . You 'll have a heightened sense of awareness . Everything will seem very real . If you believe something can hurt you , it will . You sure you 're up for this , Professor ? Absolutely , my boy . You 'll be linked to Wade and her dreams through these electrodes . You will share her experience . Now , together , you may be able to change the outcome . At least , that 's what my husband believed . Now although I 've given each of you a hypnotic suggestion , you must remind each other that nothing is real . Your lives depend on that . Now , I 'll be monitoring all of you . It 's gonna be my call to bring you out . Understood ? Put us under . ( voice ) No , no , no . Wade ! Wade ! [ Voice chattering ] Wade ! Wade ! Wade ! [ Hissing ] We 're all here , Wade . Where 's here ? It doesn 't look like anyplace I 've ever seen . My God , it 's a ... It 's just a dream . It 's not real . ( Captain ) Ready ! Aim ! It 's not real . It 's a dream ! Fire ! [ Groans ] It 's not real . It 's a dream . It 's a dream ! It 's not real ! It 's not real ! [ Monitor beeping ] Wade ! Rembrandt ! Professor ! Dr. Lujan , tell me what to do . Q-Ball ? Where are you ? Quinn ? What the hell is this ? Rembrandt . Did I ever tell you that I am really afraid of snakes ? Yeah . L ... I 'm not too fond of them myself . What ? [ Voice cackling ] It 's just a dream . It 's a damn convincing one . [ Voice shrieking ] What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna let one of them strike me . It 's the only way to prove that they can 't hurt us , okay ? Yeah . It 's just a dream . [ Hissing ] It 's only a dream . Only a dream . [ Lightning surging ] [ Coughs ] [ Voice laughing ] [ Screaming ] Damn it ! [ Monitor flattening ] [ Gasping ] Am I dreaming ? No ! Then send me back . No , it 's too risky . I saw your husband . I know how to save Wade ! Together we 're stronger . Send me back ! If I send you back , I won 't be able to pull you back out , you understand that ? Yes , just do it ! Hurry ! [ Quinn panting ] [ Monitor beeping ] [ Lightning surging ] We 're here for you . ( Professor ) All of us with you . Look . Remember , guys . It 's only a dream . Nonetheless , cover each other 's backs . I still wish I had a.45. Damn ! Don 't move . It 's just a dream . Rather like being inside a Cuisinart , isn 't it ? Come on , man . Let 's go ! It 's barbecue time . You can throw , but can you catch ? [ Gerald screaming ] [ Screaming continues ] ( Quinn ) Wade , how 're you feeling ? A little sleepy . Am I dreamin ' ? ( Rembrandt ) Not anymore . Welcome back . [ Wade exhales ] How long until we slide ? Twelve hours . Slide ? I may have time to tell you before we ... Edward ? Oh , my God . I believe we 've seen an end to this tyranny . Well , I guess it 's time to do some celebrating , huh ? Count me out . [ Chuckles ] ( Rembrandt ) Guess I 'll lay down , too , for a while . [ Professor yawns ] I must confess , I 'm suddenly feeling very sleepy . [ Grunts ] Good night , Mr. Brown . Good night , Mr. Mallory . Hey . Sweet dreams . Thank you . [ Exhales ]

 After 150 years of calling out ... the silence of the universe assures us that life is unique . We are alone . You and I ... are among the first to bring life to the stars ... to this planet ... the farthest any human has ever ventured . I know there are those at home who say ... that we are here only as a status symbol . Others say that we are fortune hunters ... or that we 're running away . But I know we 're here because of faith ... faith in each other , in a better world . The rocket fuel that brought us here can be burnt away ... but our belief in ourselves , in one another ... in the future ... never can be ; never will be . Aw , come on , Buzz . What is it ? It 's okay , Buzz . It 's just a meteor shower . Mayday ! Mayday ! This is the Vesta Colony . Repeat , Vesta Colony . We 're under attack by unidentified craft . Many are dead . " T " minus 40 seconds , and counting . 82 tank pressurization okay . - Roger . Out . - Tellus , this is Control . A.P.U. start is go . You are on your onboard computer . Over . Roger . Out . Tellus , you are go for auto sequence start . Lock your visors and initiate O2 points . Roger . We copy . Tellus out . We are " T " minus 20 seconds and counting . - Auxiliary power units start . - Go . Roger , A.P.U. we copy . Tellus out . " T " minus ten , nine ... eight , seven , six , five ... four , three . Countdown hold . " T " minus three seconds . Tellus , you are go for launch . Simulated launch sequence complete . Reset countdown to nine hours , 15 minutes , 12 seconds . You are go for launch . Vesta Colony never ran this smooth . They 're still having problems . We lost communication with Vesta this morning . If I 'm this pumped by a test launch , I won 't need a rocket . Final countdown . I know . Most people don 't know if their dreams will ever come true . Ours is definitely nine hours and two minutes away . Attention , colonists Aprey , West , Celina , Brown ... Glick , Gonzalez , Hyan , Larly , Mannesis , and Gatharian ... report to Governor Overmeyer 's office immediately . Over there ! Hey ! Check him . I knew it . A Tank . I smell ' em like an animal . I told the foreman not to hire him . Get him up . I had two uncles die ... in the A.I. war 'cause the Tanks wouldn 't fight . The InVitro platoons were dissolved when I was a kid . I had nothing to do with it . Then you 're even more worthless . I never asked to be born . Great . Then you can ask to die . Go on . Ask . Ask . Hey , get off the car . - You gotta protect me . - What the hell are you doing ? - Get out ! Get out of there ! - Drop it ! He 's crazy , sir . He 's a Tank . What 'd you do ? Go on , get out . You 're setting him off . Drop it ! - He tried to hang me . - I said put it down . Damn InVitros are all alike . " InVitros " ? Call him what he is ... a Tank . We 're told to report immediately ... and then they make us wait two hours ? The others didn 't have to wait . Good afternoon , sir . The launch simulation went perfect . We are still a go ? I know you are aware of the growing rights movement for InVitros ... those conceived and born in artificial gestation tanks . Sir , we have every right to support the InVitros . They 're human beings , sir , just like us only conceived from parents who never lived . Last evening the Tellus Board of Governors ... was issued a directive from the United States Senate . The launch will be scrapped ... unless ten InVitros are on board . Given the severe limitations on weight ... rations , and personnel capacity ... Are you saying we 're being replaced ? It is my sincere regret to inform you ... that one of you ... will not be on board . - One of us ? - Nine colonists have been released . - Postpone the mission . - If we don 't go in six hours ... the forecasted wormhole passage to Tellus ... won 't be open for another 12 years . They 're not even trained . Send them on the next colony . The next colonial mission won 't be ready for five years . There are members of Congress who need to look good now . - We 'll both resign . - You have a commitment to execute vital assignments ... on this mission , duties which one of you could cover ... but for which no one else is trained . Not to mention the severe legal consequences ... of breaking your contract . Besides I know you both . It 's your dream to go to space . The dream was to go together . I 'm on record as saying this directive stinks . I fought it all the way . Rather than issuing an order ... I 'm allowing the two of you to decide who shall remain . There is , uh , an alternative for one of you . There is a possibility the Marine Corps Space Cavalry ... may be assigned duty as Colonial Sentries . You want us to bet our lives on a possibility ? We did everything you told us . We followed the rules . We gave the program everything we had . These InVitros didn 't train . These senators haven 't sacrificed . Why should we pay for a mistake they made before we were even born ? You 're letting them throw away our lives . We believed in you . Now the only thing you can believe in ... is each other . Please arrive at your decision by 2130 today . They 're coming . The lights . Shane , take care of them . Remember how I told you . The A.I. ' s , they 're here . Hurry . I love you . Everyone 's saying good-bye to their families . I never thought we 'd be saying good-bye to each other . Then let 's run away . To a life of what ? Because we broke our contract , no one would employ us . We 'd be indentured servants to the Colonial Program for 20 years . Did they keep their word to us ? The program was all I ever believed in . And now there 's nothing . You believed in equal rights for InVitros . Not at the expense of our rights . We 've trained , we 've sacrificed , we 've dreamed ... together . Well , maybe we have to find another dream . We can 't spend the last hours we have together as victims . We have to somehow take control . Gantry 4 , complete final preparations .

Got him . - Nathan ? - No , Kylie . It has to be you . I wrote this for when you are going to land . - I can 't leave . - I 'll find you . - Come on now , don 't fight it . - I will find you ! Nathan ? I believe in you . Why 'd you enlist ? Just did . My name 's Nathan . - Hi . Shane Vansen . - Hi . Mike Pagodin . Vanessa Damphousse . Damphousse . Damphousse ... is that , like , French for something ? Probably ... but my friends just call me " damn fool . " It 's got a tough ring to it . My friends call me Pags , like I 'm a dog or something . Nice to meet you , Pags . Yeah , you too . Hey , uh , I know it 's only the first day . Any guess as to when we get our planes ? The 127th . That 's why I joined . " The Angry Angels " ... best there is or ever will be . Someday ... that 'll be me . They 're gonna yell a lot , aren 't they ? I hope they don 't yell as much as I 've heard they do . All right , you people , listen up . You are now at the United States Marine Corps ... Space Aviator Recruit Depot , Loxley , Alabama . When you left home , you were under Mommy and Daddy 's care . You are now under mine . From here out , you will not speak , eat , sleep ... or take a dump until you are told to do so . And the first and last words out of your slimy holes will be " sir " . - Do you maggots understand me ? - Sir , yes , sir . - Louder ! - Sir , yes , sir ! Upon the command you will be given approximately 30 seconds to fall out of this bus . - Any questions ? - Sir , when do we get our planes , sir ? Move ! Move ! Move ! - Move ! Move ! - Hurry up . - Move , move . - Let 's go , let 's go . - Move ! - Come on , move it . - Nice sunglasses . - Yes , thanks , homes . I got ... - Give me those . Move ! - What are you looking at ? I am Sergeant Major Bougus . I am your senior drill instructor . I am here to turn you slimy civilian cesspool parasites ... into United States Marine Corps space aviators ... invoking bowel-wrenching fear into the dark hearts of your enemies . - Why are you here ? - Sir , to find a direction , sir . - A direction ? Are you lost ? - Sir , I suffer from a sense of disconnection ... - Answer the question . - Sir , yes , I am , sir . Well , do I look like a road map to you ? - Sir , no , sir . - I am a road map . I will lead and you will follow . I will teach and you will learn . When you leave my academy , you will be weapons ... focused and full of purpose ... hot rod rocket jocks of precision and strength ... tear-assing across the cosmos , hunting for heaven . What 's your name ? Wang . - Paul Wang , Officer . - Officer ? I 'm not an officer . I work for a living . Did I hear a sound out of you , Wang ? I did ! I did hear a sound . I 'll bet it was your Marine Corps battle cry . - Let me hear your battle cry . - Aaah ! I am not impressed . Sergeant , demonstrate a Marine Corps battle cry for this pantywaist . Still pathetic . In space , no one can hear you scream ... unless it is the battle cry of the United States Marines . Why did you join my precious Marine Corps ? - Sir , to defend my country , sir . - To defend your country from what ? We have no enemies . Are you crazy ? - I think you made a horrible mistake . - Sir , no , sir . - Are you calling me a liar ? - Sir , the best way to maintain peace ... is to maintain a good defense , sir . Are you a politician ? Are you running for office ? - Do you think I 'm funny ? - Sir , no , sir . - Do I amuse you ? - Sir , no , sir . Drop down and give me 25 . Well , I 'm glad to see you 're having such a fun time . You too . On your face . Twenty-five . One , two , three , four . I love the Marine Corps . Gunnery Sergeant ? Are all of these worms present or accounted for ? Short one , Sergeant Major ... the Tank ... Cooper Hawkes . He 's all yours . I know all about you , Hawkes . So the judge thought it would be cute ... to sentence a Tank to the military . I fought alongside you people in the A.I. wars ... so I know that Tanks are lazy ... and they don 't care about anyone ... or anything . I won 't let you down . The only thing you 're going to let down is your face upon my deck ... and crank out 50 pushups . Now , do it . One , two , three , four . I love the Marine Corps . One , two , three , four . I love the Marine Corps . Trans-Tellus injection complete . Prepare for entry . Five billion years from now , maybe to the day ... the sun burns 90 % of its hydrogen ... the balance is destroyed ... more energy is created than released . Quickly , a few million years ... the sun radiates all of its potential power . The star swells . Mercury , Venus , the Earth disappear ... swallowed . The sun truly , finally touches the sky . Life vanishes eons ago . Eventually , the sun shrinks ... decreasing to the size of the Earth ... which reappears from the red dwarf 's grasp . With no gravity to hold it ... the Earth slowly floats away . Elsewhere , stars are born . Other star systems ... older , larger ... continue to breathe . The solar system dies of crib death . If that 's what it takes ... This is Red Leader . Bandits at 2 : 00 . Confirm . Red Leader , this is R-3 . Confirm . A.O.A. , 15 degrees . R-4 . Confirm . Check six . R-5 , check six . R-5 , check six . Hawkes , answer me . Enemy craft have us locked on . Duke right . Buzz east . Hawkes is breaking formation . What 's he doing ? - I don 't know . He 's not responding . - Answer me , Hawkes ! He 's coming right for me . Hawkes , hit the deck ! You 're dead . You 're dead ! The entire squad is dead , and it 's your fault . Now , get out . - You stupid Tank . - What the hell were you doing ? You two , shut the hell up . You are dead . This ain 't real . One day , Hawkes , it will be real ... and you 're gonna find yourself right in the middle of a big hairy fur ball ... and you will die . With you around , the squad doesn 't need to worry about the enemy . Just you . Just you ! Should have blown your ass away . Is that a fact ? Out ! Everybody out of your cockpits . Now ! Get down here . You 're too slow . Quickly . Move it ! You ! Grab his ass . That 's an order . Grab it . Everyone , grab the ass of the person to your right . Well , now . Isn 't that beautiful ? Do you feel it ? His ass is yours , her ass is yours , and yours is theirs . You may fly in individual rockets ... but you are a squadron , you are a team ... and if your risk your ass , you risk the team 's . You people have been here six weeks now ... and you still do not know how to work together . Well , you will learn to work together ... or that fatty clump of flesh in your hand ... will be blown to the far corners of the universe ... - and yours will be right behind it . - Sir ? Maybe Coop would do better in a real plane , sir . - I know I would . - I 'm afraid of you people in a simulator . Now we 're going to do it again ... and we 're going to keep doing it until we get it right . Get back into your pits . Go ! Move it ! Think I could ever talk the Marine Corps into pleats ? Oh , right . Pleats . - Know what I think ? - Yeah , yeah , you give ' em planes on the very first day . Well , yeah . It makes sense . Yeah . I was ... Beer . On the house for an Angry Angel . Shane , you want another one ? Look . The Angry Angels . Hi . - Serve it here . - We got room . Pull up a chair . Pull up a chair . Shane , maybe you 'd better ... Excuse me . I 'm sorry to interrupt . I just wanted to tell you all how much I admire and respect the 127th . Thanks . Thanks a lot . We 'll have four pitcher of draft and a couple of shooters . She 's not a waitress , she 's a marine ... so apologize . Until she graduates , she 's slime . Now you apologize . So , what 's the farthest you guys have ever flown ? - Four point eight light years . - Well , that 's how far you can shove your apology . We interrupt this programming ... to bring you an emergency announcement ... from the Secretary General of the United Nations , Spencer Chartwell . Not since the moment of creation ... has our universe changed so infinitely ... so desperately , so quickly . Hey , you guys , listen . Listen ! Tonight , for the first time in the brief history of mankind ... we are truly of one planet . Last evening we confirmed ... that the landing party of the Tellus Colony ... was massacred ... unprovoked , by an advanced alien civilization ... of tremendous power . Two hundred and twenty-five are dead . Twenty-five are unaccounted for . Because of destroyed communications , we 've only now learned ... that the Vesta Colony suffered the same fate . The alien civilization ... has not responded to our attempts at communication . Of this race we know nothing . The only clue to their people ... is the bloodshed they 've left behind . My fellow citizens of Earth ... no matter where you stand on this planet ... either beneath the sun 's warmth or the cold of night ... storm clouds of war gather over our home . Soon they may fall in unceasing thunderbolts . We must stand together against the deluge . We cannot possibly retreat . There is no moving the Earth . Please stay tuned to this channel ... for further information . Government updates will follow . This is F.T.N. I believe in you . Ho ! Knock off the grab-ass and fall in . We are at war . Hurrah ! War is what marines pray for . From here on out , every move is crucial ... all personnel vital . While combat-ready pilots are being dispatched into battle ... you people have been assigned a training mission ... nonetheless imperative to the global war effort . You will proceed via military heavy-launch vehicle ... to the space station Goddard . At Goddard { y : i } you will board an inter-solar system cargo vehicle ... and proceed for 84 hours ... to the planet Mars . You will be issued rationed supplies ... food , air , water for one week . You will be issued one urine and fecal collection device . A yellow flashing light on the flight suit ... indicates full capacity . Your mission is to repair a malfunctioning Mars tracking drone ... vital to interplanetary communication . As part of your training ... there is no commanding officer . You will be on your own . From this moment until we win this war ... the only easy day is yesterday . I heard they had an army of six million . They can 't know that . How could they know ? You think they got better planes than we do ? They gotta be more advanced . I knew we couldn 't have been alone ... but now that we 're not , I don 't know what 's scarier ... being alone or ... Do you think you 'd be scared if you saw one ? I remember when I was a kid and saw my first A.I. They looked so human , but something inside me could just tell . I felt that way when I saw my first InVitro . I don 't mean anything by that , Coop . Hit the sack . When the time comes to face ' em , we 'll all hack it fine . You okay ? Mm . Sorry I woke you . I wasn 't asleep . Don 't take this wrong ... but , uh , I was just wondering ... I mean ... Well , I 've always heard that InVitros can 't dream . I dream . I know they never lived ... but when I dream , I see my parents . Me too . Only I have nightmares about mine ... same ones since I was five . What happens ? Hmm . My parents were Marine Corps officers ... in the Artificial Intelligence War . One night the A.I. patrol attacked our house . My mother hid my sisters and I in this crawl space in the attic . I saw them kill my parents . Your sisters still alive ? Mm-hmm . That night during the attack , my sister tried to scream ... and I put my hand over her mouth and she bit into me . I still have the scar . What 's weird is we 're not close . Maybe I 'm the parent that they needed to grow away from ... or maybe seeing them reminds me of ... They 've always looked to me my whole life . I need to get away from people looking to me . I joined for me ... my life . I 'm tired of taking care of others for a while . Does that sound bad ? Did you ever lose anyone close ? What the hell was that ? How does " Did you ever lose anyone close , " translate into " Please stick your tongue down my throat " ? I don 't know a lot about loss and nightmares ... so don 't go to moaning over it . I won 't be around here much longer anyway . What are you , looking to buy real estate ? Let 's go . There 's a war on . Load the gear . - First we secure our location . Low ? - Mm-hmm ? Our position ... is out in the middle of nowhere . They 're secured . Now unload this gear . - The HIST manual clearly states ... - The manual ? When they drop you in the middle of a hairy fur ball ... you gonna take time to check the manual ? You do what you want . I 'll be happy to see you take one the minute we 're in battle . We do what we 're told . Oh , that 's right . Follow their rules . They 'll just keep taking from you , and you 'll let ' em . Hey ! - West , get off him . Hawkes . Hawkes . - Wait a minute , you guys . Help me get ' em apart . What the hell is wrong with you ? And you , knock it off . We have a mission to achieve . You think we 're going to blow it because you two need to butt heads ? We 're drivin 'on , so you two better get your heads screwed on right . Now , Low , tell West our position . Low ? We 're 45 degrees south , 271 west ... the Hellas plains . That accounts for the sparse vegetation . They just started terra-forming this area . The tracking drone is about four klicks from here . What should we do ? All right , grab your gear . Let 's move out . Hey , Coop . I can get up myself . Probably , but it looks like you could use a hand , and I 'm offering one . Ain 't easy for me to recognize a helping hand . If that 's a thank you , don 't worry about it . Someday you 'll pay me back . Damphousse , replace the transceiver units ... and let 's go back . We 've got about ten hours of sunlight . - What 's this ? - That 's the Earth message . They made it a requirement that all off-Earth installations had to have one . It 's got pictures and sounds of Earth , in case an extraterrestrial found it . Mozart . If only this had been our first contact with them . They would have never killed the colonists . Whoa ! If they would have heard this first they would have wiped us out a long time ago ... and I wouldn 't have blamed them . Hey . - What the hell is that ? - I know this . I heard this in my 20th Century history class . They called this rock and roll . I think this group was called The Pink Floyd . They went like this ... Hey , ho , let 's go . Look ! What ? Move out ! Move out ! - Let 's go ! - One , one thousand . Two , one thousand . Three one thousand ... On Mars , about ten miles away . Let 's do it . All right , we all go . Everyone carries water and their M-590s . Let 's do it . - All right . - Okay . - You got it ? - Yeah . Could be a Mars orbiter . - Maybe it 's a classified recon ship . - Something to do with the war . Damphousse , Carter , West , Stone , Pags and me . The rest of you spread out , provide cover . - You don 't want me to go ? - Mm-mmm . You stay here in case something happens . Move out . Radiation levels ? Uh , let 's say we don 't stay long . Can 't see anything . What the hell is it ? Well , I can 't see a cockpit or anything . There 's no electronics . Take cover ! Take cover ! Move it ! Move , move , move ! - Fall back ! - Move out ! Shane ! Sit tight , West . I got you . You 're squared away . How 's Vansen ? Pressure 's stabilizing . - Low is on . - Pags is dead . - You all right , Vansen ? - Yeah . Thanks . West is solo . Damn it . What the hell is he doing ? You three move out with me . Rest of you stay here . West ? There it is . Stone , Carter , over here . Stone , over here . I think it 's trying to surrender . I think it thinks we 're going to kill it . - The odor 's gonna make me sick . - Smells sulfuric . Must be a scout ... going toward Earth ... had to crank the chicken switch over Mars . - Probably sent a distress call . - That means there 'll be more coming . There 's got to be some way to figure it out . Don 't . It could carry some kind of disease . I never had a mother , but you sound like one . Looks like it operates the vehicle ... like a key . Yeah , some sort of encoded information . What is this ? Him ? What does this have to do with him ? This is this ? It 's like a picture of his family or something . Maybe we ought to give it something to eat or drink . It wants water . Right . It 's probably one thing we have in common . - Let 's give it some water . - What the hell is the matter with you ? We 're low on rations as it is , we 're cut to 30 % O2 flow ... and you guys want to waste water on this thing ? No . No way . This thing killed Pags ! God knows who else it killed . I 'm giving it some water . Let 's show it what it means to be human . Not such a good idea . I can 't believe ... that it would be so afraid of us that it would kill itself . We 're the enemy . This is the first time I 've ever seen a dead body . Won 't be the last . Today you have been assigned ... your SA-43 endo-exo atmospheric attack jets . Your current orders are to take 48 hours ' leave . - Sir , ship us out , sir . - Sir , why have we been ... on accelerated training if we 're not going to be used , sir ? Listen . All we know is what you people found last week . We have no idea what lies ahead . We know basically nothing about the enemy ... numbers , weapons , tactics . That 's why we have been losing ... and losing badly in every battle of this war . Don 't be in such a hurry . My advice ... Go home . See your families . Could be the last time . Dismissed . Gonna go see your sisters ? I don 't think they want to see me . I don 't know if my parents want to see me . I never told them I was joining the Corps . They 'll want to see you . Want to be a witness to that ? I 'll never get in one of those . Ten of us Tanks were with the Tellus Colony . Only makes the aliens just as bad . I 'm not going to die for them . What would you die for ? Nathan ? Mom , Dad , it 's Nathan ! - Nathan ! - Johnny . Come on . Nathan . Mom , Dad , this is my friend , Shane Vansen . It 's a pleasure , Mr. And Mrs. West . Dinner is ... is almost ready . I was gonna give you a rock I pocketed on Mars ... but they took it . Come on inside . Hey , Neal . - Hey . - Shane , this is my brother , Neal . - Hi . - Hi . The TV said we 're about to begin another battle . I 'm here at the U.N. Task Force Headquarters ... at Vandenberg , California , receiving the latest reports ... I heard the alien fighters are made of some unknown metal ... that we can 't harm it . We 've only started reverse engineering on the one we found . It 's just rumors . Kylen 's brother told us official dispatch of the elite Marine Corps ... fighter squadron , the 127th ... better known as the Angry Angels , which left their base ... in Loxley , Alabama , sometime last evening . This is , without a doubt , the largest mobilization of Unified Earth force ... It doesn 't seem like we can win . Don 't worry . This time out we 'll beat ' em . - How do you know ? - Well , because this time ... they 're going up against the 127th ... the Angry Angels . They will knock the enemy into Andromeda . ... seen from the Earth in the Northern Hemisphere ... about 50 degrees above the southeast horizon . Uh ... Pags ... um ... I wanted to say something to you when they buried you ... but I don 't know what . And now that I 'm here , I still don 't . Besides , they don 't let anybody say anything at those things anyway . I guess I just wanted to say ... you were the only guy that was ever okay to me . I wish ... I just wish , somehow , you could ... just feel my insides and know . Maybe right now you can . I doubt it . I wish I knew what you were feeling right now . See , I thought I knew what it would be like ... but seeing you up there ... all ... blood ... I just ... I wish I could know if anything 's worth it . Earth-based forces report major casualties . Here , on the U.S.S. Yorktown , the 127th Airborne ... known as the Angry Angels , are engaging the enemy and meeting heavy resistance . There 's smoke , electrical flashes . You can hear the metal buckling in the bow of the carrier . It 's over . Attention , all aviators ... of the Marine Corps Aviators Cavalry . You are to report immediately to base for active duty . Repeat : M.C.A. pilots ... are to report to base by 0630 for immediate active duty . Nathan . Our orders are in . Any idea where we 're heading ? Damphousse said we 're going straight to the line . We 've got the 127th coming in . They 're bringing in the Angels . The 127th . Ten-hut ! Be seated . The information you 're about to receive is classified level red . I don 't need to remind you of the consequences of divulging class red information . 58th , because of you ... we 've caught a break ... a major break . Within the wreckage of the alien recon vehicle ... you recovered during your HIST ... was an encoded transmission detailing the enemy 's projected battle objectives . Subsequently , all enemy movements have been anticipated . Fearing that the captured information may be deceptive ... we have not shown our hand ... until now . The Earth is here . The enemy intends to attack with extreme intent ... two-thirds of its forces , at the Groombridge 34 Star System Naval base ... in 71 hours . This is known as point " G " . The Earth forces ... the greatest mobilization of military might since the 20th century ... will surprise attack from behind enemy positions ... at two points , point " F " , here , and point " H " , here . The Marines will participate with the 8th Air Wing . This will be possible ... due to a fortuitous projected wormhole opening in the Galileo regions . From the captured information , we have ascertained ... their planes are faster , with a greater rate of climb ; ours are more maneuverable and better armed . It evens out . Surprise has been their best weapon . Now it 's ours . It 's too easy . Sir , if the plans weren 't planted ... then they at least would assume we have them . No doubt their intelligence informed them we would be unable to decipher the transmission . And , in fact , it has taken ... fifty Quantum Charno computers interlinked on four continents ... to decode the enemy 's complex language . And , as mentioned , their movements have since ... been in accord with the captured plans . Sir , are deploying to point " F " or " H " , sir ? 58th Squadron will operate in a support capacity at point " A " . - Point " A " ? - Here . Rear left flank . Sir , why bother telling us the plan if we weren 't going to be a part of it ? You are part of it ... rear left flank . Sir , request permission to transfer to 8th Air wing . - Denied . - Sir , with all due respect , we have the right ... Sit down , Lieutenant . 58th will report to the naval space carrier Saratoga across the Jupiter line ... by 0840 tomorrow . You 'll meet your squadron commander on board . Dismissed . Gold Leader confirm Saratoga position at 32.5 megastatute kilometers . Come in , Gold Leader . Confirm . Just a minute . I 'm getting interference on the light LIDAR . Check six . I had a bogey on the HUD . Must have been an asteroid or ... Red Leader . Confirm bandit or recon vehicle . Confirm , confirm . LIDAR 4 . - Alien bogey , 10 : 00 . - I 'll turn intercept angle 30 degrees . Blue Team , White Team , watch six . Hack . 12 : 00 high . He jinked . Scram ! Scram ! - Lost it . - Must be jamming our LIDAR . Went below us like a fish on the line . - Let 's go fishing . - Negative . Don 't have the fuel . Return to designated course . I 'll call Space Com and report A.C.M. with the enemy . Hammerhead disengage sequence complete . Change bay doors . Hey , hey . What 's going on ? They look a little harried . Ten-hut ! 58 , report to the briefing area immediately . Space Com checked out your report of the enemy recon vehicle . Radio telescopes have since found not only ... no trace of enemy troops in the Groombridge system ... but rather a force amassing outside our solar system . Enemy plans were a set-up . At this point , no one needs their plans ... to know which direction they 're headed . Ten-hut ! Sit down . I want to be able to look into your eyes . Courage , honor ... dedication , sacrifice ... These are just the words they used to get you here . Now the only word that means a damn to you is " life " ... Yours ... your buddies ' . The one certainty in war is that in an hour , maybe two ... you 'll either still be alive or you 'll be dead . For the next hour , here 's your best chance of staying alive . The Trojan asteroid belt trails Jupiter 's orbit . Our objective is to hide in the debris . This may be as difficult as engaging the enemy . You 're gonna have to react to the pitch and yaw of the asteroids ... in order to keep out of sight , shielded from LIDAR . Intelligence says they 'll fly right by ... then jump ' em . Now , nobody 's asking you to wax their tails . Your goal is to stall them . Our forces at Groombridge 34 ... have doubled back , and are right now passing through the Collie wormhole . If we successfully delay the enemy ... we 'll have reinforcements appearing from behind them ... and out of the sun .

Objective achieved . Yes . Because of the valiant efforts ... of the Marine Corps 58th Squadron ... the many peoples of Earth will breathe a single sigh of relief ... and tonight , at their graduation ceremony ... we honor them . I believe even the great leader of the 20th century ... Winston Churchill would agree ... never ... in the field of conflict ... has there been so much owed by so many to so few . We of Earth ... are proud and grateful . Celebrate well . Although I suppose the break in the storm is momentary ... the thunder shall return ... and the lightning ... will certainly strike again .

Other star systems , older , larger ... continue to breathe . The solar System dies of crib death . If that 's what it takes ... then okay . If I must wait that long , then all right . Because when I think of this ... nothing is more desirable than the hope ... of watching that last day , when the sun flickers out ... with you beside me . We 'll sit alone on a dark chunk of ice at the top of the world ... and the stars above ... beyond , and between us ... will never shine brighter as we drift away ... into space . Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

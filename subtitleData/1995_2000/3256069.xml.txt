 Its trajectory is erratic . And our sensors aren 't detecting any stellar or planetary gravitational fields that could account for its motion . Then you 're saying it isn 't a comet . And yet , it looks , feels and tastes just like a comet . Well , there 's a slight chance there are magnetodynamic forces acting on the comet that are too subtle for our sensors to detect . Or it might be something we 've never encountered before . B 'Elanna , go down to Transporter Room 2 . Let 's beam aboard a sample for examination . Aye , Captain . Harry , see if you can lock onto a core fragment . Having no trouble penetrating the crust , Captain . Janeway to Torres . We 're ready when you are , Lieutenant . Setting up a class-3 containment field , Captain . Field in place . Commence transport . Energizing . Hello . My name is Q. Torres to Janeway . You 'd better get down here , Captain . Problem , Lieutenant ? Yes , ma 'am . That transport from the comet ... it brought a man aboard . He says his name is Q. Red Alert . I 'll be right down . Oh , please don 't bother , Captain . Let me take you to lunch instead . What a pleasure it is to meet you . Oh , am I doing this right ? It 's been so long since I 've had the opportunity to greet anyone . Oh , uh ... here . Take a seat . Allow me to make the setting more appropriate . My name is Kathryn Janeway Captain of the Federation ... Federation Starship Voyager . Yes , yes . I know all that . Look ... Welsh rabbit like your grandfather used to make . Rabbit ? She never told me she likes rabbits . What is a rabbit , anyway ? Is this some new chef she 's interviewing ? Please , eat . It 's the least I can do to express my appreciation . Appreciation for what ? For letting me out of my captivity . You were being held against your will inside the comet ? In a manner of speaking . And you ... all of you ... you 're mortals , aren 't you ? Who was holding you prisoner ? And you ... only live for nine years . That 's right . Oh , how I envy you . Why is that ? Because the one thing I want more than any other is to die . Look ... I don 't know what you want here , but I know who you are . Every Captain in Starfleet has been briefed about your appearances on the Enterprise , and I 'm warning ... My ... my appearances ? Oh , you 've mistaken me for ... Oh , well , no matter . I really must get on with my business before the others realize I 'm here . When someone asks you about me , and they will , would you tell them I said ... You know , I 've had 300 years to think of appropriate last words . I wanted something ... memorable , you know ? Quotable . Would you tell them I said , " I die not for myself but for you . " I know . I ... I know . Enigmatic , provocative . They 'll understand . Well ... good-bye to you all . Many thanks . Here 's the end of me . Oh ... dear . That 's not right . Torres to Janeway . All the men have disappeared . I 'm aware of it , Lieutenant . Report to the Bridge . Janeway out . Bring them back now . Oh , oh . Of course , of course . I 'm ... a little out of practice . Well ... that 's that , I 'm afraid ... they 're gone . Gone ? Where ? Just ... gone . Oh , I apologize for the inconvenience . Well , good luck to you all . I really have to be going now . Return my crew . I ... I 'm not sure how . Humans ... humans ... Who would have more recent experience with humans ? What have you done now , Q ? Well , now , isn 't this just fine . Humans aren 't supposed to be in this Quadrant for another hundred years . I didn 't bring them here . Nothing to do with me . How did you get out , Q ? I 'm afraid we 're responsible for that . Oh , well , I guess that 's what we get for having a woman in the Captain 's seat . You know , I was betting that Riker would get this command . May I assume you 're the Q I 've heard so much about ? Have you heard about little me ? Oh , do tell . Has Jean-Luc been whispering about me behind my back ? Say , is this a ship of the Valkyries or have you human women finally done away with your men altogether ? There was a slight accident . A slight accident ? Oh , let me guess . You were trying to commit suicide . Now you see why we 've locked him up for the last 300 years . Facial art ! Ooh , how very wilderness of you . Captain ? All right , Q , we should be going . I 'm not leaving . Captain Janeway , I demand asylum . This is a joke . No , it isn 't . I am officially asking you , Captain , to grant me asylum and give me protection from my enemies , which is him . You would ask these puny humans to protect you from me ? Fat chance . What did you do to him ? Nothing . He 's still there in the 24th century . I just took the rest of us to an old hiding place of mine . Report . Captain , there are no stars outside . Well , that 's partially accurate . Actually , there 's no universe outside . On screen . Commander ? I 'm showing a large buildup of baryonic particles . Perfectly normal . Captain , based on our readings , it appears we 've been transported back in time to the birth of the universe . Very old hiding place . Oh , I know all the hiding places , Q. I hid here from the Continuum myself once . This ship will not survive the formation of the cosmos . Yes , but just think of the honor of having your DNA spread from one corner of the universe to the other . Why , you could be the origin of the humanoid form . Q ... either Q ... get us out of here . You heard the lady , Q ... back to your cell . We 're under attack . By a ship ? By ... by ... I 'm not sure what they are . Captain , I don 't believe this , but according to my readings , we 're being attacked by protons . We 've been reduced to subatomic proportions . He 'll never find us here . Mr. Tuvok , see if you can release a positive ion charge to repel them . Ready or not , here I am . Now what ? Checking . We seem to be tethered to some kind of large ... plant . Let 's see it . Computer , I need a wider angle . You can 't hide from me , Q. And you can 't take me by force . I 'll stalemate you for eternity if I have to . The hell you will . The vaunted Q Continuum ... self-anointed guardians of the universe . How dare you come aboard this ship and endanger this crew with your personal tug-of-war ? Did anyone ever tell you you 're angry when you 're beautiful ? We 're back where we started from , Captain . Doesn 't matter . I 'm not going back into that cell . How would you like to spend eternity as a Gorokian midwife toad ? Oh , just try it . Stop . You want asylum ? Fine . We 'll have a hearing . A hearing ! You would have me put his future into your delicate little hands ? Oh , so touchably soft . What is your secret , dear ? When the Captain of a Starfleet vessel receives an official request for asylum , there is a clear procedure to follow . I suggest , to end your deadlock and to save my ship , that we follow it to the letter . Well , this could go on for a millennium or two , I suppose . All right , I accept on behalf of the Continuum on one condition ... if you rule in our favor , Q agrees to return to his confinement . I have a condition of my own . If you rule in my favor , then the Continuum must grant me mortality . Why ? So you can kill yourself ? Exactly . Accepted . Well , this is going to make for an amusing diversion . Will you send him to prison for eternity or will you assist in his suicide plan ? That 's a toughie , but then again , that 's why they made you Captain , isn 't it ? To handle the real tough ones . My , my . Now I guess we get to find out whether the pants ... really fit . Am I interrupting anything ? I am curious . Have the Q always had an absence of manners , or is it the result of some natural evolutionary process that comes with omnipotence ? What ? Oh , you mean just popping in whenever we feel like it ? That is one relevant example . I apologize . At some point along the way , I guess we just stopped thinking about the little niceties . So it seems . But you mustn 't think of us as omnipotent , no matter what the Continuum would like you to believe . You and your ship seem incredibly powerful to life-forms without your technical expertise . It 's no different with us . We may appear omnipotent to you , but believe me , we 're not . Intriguing . Just what vulnerabilities do the Q have ? Always looking for the tactical advantage , Mr. Tuvok . Very good . As a matter of fact , that 's why I 've come to see you . In a way , our vulnerability is what this is all about . As the Q have evolved , we 've sacrificed many things along the way ... not just manners , but mortality and a sense of purpose and a desire for change and a capacity to grow . Each loss is a new vulnerability ... wouldn 't you say ? Why are you telling me this ? Because I want you to represent me at the hearing . Me ? I have no legal expertise . But I need someone who understands Federation asylum practices . Besides ... Vulcans approve of suicide . It is true that Vulcans who reach a certain infirmity with age do practice ritual suicides . Nevertheless , I fail to see how that fact would be meaningful in this circumstance . I have the right to counsel , Mr. Tuvok . Will you assist me ? Let me begin by stating clearly that I expect all parties to act appropriately and with respect for these proceedings . I will not have this hearing turned into a circus . Is that clear ? Is that clear , Q ? Madam Captain , we are dealing here with an issue of the greatest importance to the Q Continuum . I can assure you , we take this matter very seriously . Thank you . And please don 't call me " Madam Captain . " Since you 've made it clear that your asylum would lead to suicide , you place me in a difficult position . I understand , Captain . May I ask you why you want to commit suicide ? As difficult as it is for you to imagine , for me , immortality is impossible to endure any longer . In the Continuum , an individual has an obligation to be responsible to the path his life will follow . " His life will follow . " Emphasize life . I never yielded that obligation to the Continuum . If the path I choose leads to death , what right have they to interfere ? He 's putting his selfish wishes above the welfare of everyone else . And if I don 't agree with the majority , I 'm to be locked up for eternity . You would not be confined if you were not intent on harming yourself . With your permission , Captain , I would like to call an expert on the Continuum to discuss the implications of the decision to be made . Proceed . I call myself to the stand . Ta-da ! Thank you for coming . It 's a rare honor to have someone of your reputation and accomplishment with us today . Thank you . Tell me , what would be the impact of a Q suicide ? Oh , it would be an interruption to the Continuum . It would change the very nature of Q. Can you be more specific ? No , because we 're not even sure what the end result would be . His suicide could have all sorts of unknown consequences for the Continuum . Precisely ! It would force the Q to deal with the unknown for the first time since the new era began . They 're afraid of me because they 're afraid of the unknown . How would you characterize his remarks ? No Q has ever tried to commit suicide . Immortality is one of the defining qualities of being a Q. By every measure of the Continuum , his remarks would have to be considered as ... mentally unbalanced . Mentally unbalanced . And no civilized people in the universe , including the primitive Federation societies , would condone the suicide of a mentally unbalanced person . Tell me , Q , can you offer any other evidence of mental instability on the part of my client ? What more do I need ? He wants to kill himself . In fact , until this issue arose , he was known in the Continuum as one of your great philosophers . - ls that not true ? - Not anymore it isn 't . So your entire basis for judging him mentally unbalanced is his wish to commit suicide . I submit that is a faulty premise . In many cultures , suicide is acceptable and in and of itself cannot be used as evidence of mental illness . I tend to agree with Mr. Tuvok . - Oh ... Vulcans ! - Oh ... Vulcans ! Isn 't it true that on occasion , the Continuum has executed Qs for certain crimes ? On rare occasions , yes . Didn 't their deaths create an interruption in the Continuum ? Their crimes created the interruption , their deaths ended it . I know where you 're going with this , Lieutenant . Do you ? And it 's not going to work . Our society , like any other , must control its disruptive elements . An execution may be undesirable , I grant you that , but on some rare occasions , it is necessary and warranted , and a decision to proceed is made only after great deliberation by the entire Continuum . You cannot imagine the chaos that would be created if individuals like Q here could choose between life and death . This is a matter of social order versus anarchy . I understand . And you find nothing contradictory in a society that outlaws suicide but practices capital punishment ? No . Any other questions , Lieutenant ? Just one other thing . Isn 't it true that you yourself were once accused of being mentally unstable by the Continuum ? Were you not disciplined for inappropriate behavior ? Objection . I 'll allow the question . My record has been expunged . I will take that as a yes . Thank you . That is all . You 're excused . If I may beg the court 's indulgence , I have other witnesses to call . To what end ? Your Captain Honor , I am here to argue for the majesty of life ... what it means for us to be alive . A Q 's life takes him to all corners of the universe . This Q 's life has touched and affected many , many others ... including some on your own homeworld . With your permission , I would like to call some of those people whose lives have been changed by this Q. You want to bring people here from Earth ? I promise it won 't impact the timeline , and no one will remember ever having been here after I send them back . This is most unusual . Do you have any objection , Mr. Tuvok ? I am as curious as you are , Captain . Very well . Proceed . Q ! What the hell is going on ? My apologies , Commander ... To you all . My name is Kathryn Janeway . Captain Janeway , the USS Voyager . That 's correct , Commander . You 're aboard Voyager . We 're lost in the Delta Quadrant , and as much as I wish you could tell them that when you get home , your memories will be wiped before you get back . God , if you let me live through this , I promise I 'll clean up my act ... I swear . I demand an explanation ! Why are you dressed like this , young man ? Man , have you looked in a mirror lately ? Allow me to try to explain , Mister ... ? Ginsberg . Maury Ginsberg . Sir Isaac Newton . William Riker . Nice to meet you . Consider for a moment that it might be possible to travel forward in time ... say , to the 24th century ... onto a starship ... 7 5,000 light-years from Earth . You 're having a very strange dream and in this dream , you are seeing this man whom you 've all met before . Yes , I have seen that man before . You were sitting under the tree the day ... The day the apple fell on your head . Yes , that 's right . Quite a day , wasn 't it ? As a matter of fact , this man jostled the tree when he got up to leave . Just before the apple fell ... yes . And a new era in human science was born . Wait a minute ! Weren 't you the guy in the jeep ? The " guy in the jeep " who picked you up after your own vehicle broke down that summer afternoon . Isn 't that right ? Oh , man , he was a lifesaver . My van died , and they dragged it off the road because of all the traffic . It was backed up for miles . You were on your way to a job , weren 't you ? Yeah , I was supposed to be on the follow spot up in Tower 3 . I never would have made it in time if it weren 't for him . Hey , whatever happened with that groovy chick with the long red beads in the back seat ? I 've been looking for her ever since you dropped me off . You 'll see her again , don 't worry . To sum up , you were a spotlight operator at an outdoor concert of some sort , a concert that was put in jeopardy moments before it was to begin because the entire sound system failed . Oh , it was no big deal . Somebody must have snagged an extension cord with one of the trucks , that 's all . I 'm just lucky I noticed it . Yes . Lucky you were at the right place at the right time , or it would have taken days to track down the problem and there would have been no concert . Well , I 'm sorry to say I have met him , but I 've never seen this man before in my life . Are you sure ? Has it not been established that my client has been in captivity during all of Commander Riker 's lifetime ? Have you seen this photograph before ? Sure I have . That is Colonel Thaddeus Riker after he was wounded at Pine Mountain . They used to call him " Old Iron Boots . " He was in command of the 102nd New York during General Sherman 's march on Atlanta . This picture was taken in 1864 , just after they let him out of the army hospital . And the soldier beside him ? I 'll be damned . It 's him . As a matter of fact , he carried your wounded ancestor back from the front line ... Didn 't you ? My point is , Captain , Q has had a profound influence on these three lives . Without Q , Isaac Newton would have died forgotten in a Liverpool debtor 's prison ... a suspect in several prostitute murders . Without Q , there would have been no concert at , uh ... Woodstock . Wherever . More importantly , Mr. Ginsberg would never have met his future wife " the groovy chick with the long red beads " and he would never have become a successful orthodontist , settled in Scarsdale with four kids . Far out . Yes . Without Q , there would have been no William T. Riker at all , and I would have lost at least a dozen really good opportunities to insult him over the years . Oh , and lest I forget ... without Q , the Borg would have assimilated the Federation . - Thank you . - Thank you . This is the life that Q treats without respect . This is the life that he would give up so easily . May I remind this hearing and my learned colleague , that for the last three centuries , my client has not been allowed contact with anyone . At this time , we would like to reproduce the environment in which he has been confined . I object . No ... I 'll allow this . These are the conditions my client will be forced to live in for eternity if you deny him asylum , Captain . We just want to give him time to reconsider his position . I will never change my mind ! This is your own doing . You could live a perfectly normal life if you were simply willing to live a perfectly normal life . I 've seen enough . Please return us to the hearing room . I would submit that the quality of life my client will have to endure should be considered in this proceeding . I don 't like those conditions any more than you do , Mr. Tuvok , and I wouldn 't want to spend another day there if I were you , Q ... but I 'm here to rule on a request for asylum , not to judge the penal system of the Q Continuum . And he does have a point ... you were confined to prevent you from doing harm to yourself . I 've been doing a great deal of research , studying a variety of cultural attitudes on suicide to help me frame the basis of a decision . Mr. Tuvok , are you familiar with the " double effect " principle on assisted suicide that dates back to the Bolian middle ages ? I believe it relates to the relief of suffering , does it not , Captain ? It states , " an action that has the principle effect " of relieving suffering may be ethically justified " even though the same action has the secondary effect of possibly causing death . " This principle is the only thing I can find that could possibly convince me to decide in your favor , Q. And yet , as I look at you , you don 't seem , by our standards , aged , infirm or in any pain . Can you show this hearing that you suffer in any manner other than that caused by the conditions of your incarceration ? Any suffering that would justify a decision to grant you asylum ? May I request a recess to consider our response , Captain ? Granted . We 're going to lose , aren 't we ? I would say we have not yet convinced Captain Janeway of the validity of our argument . You 're doing a fine job , Mr. Tuvok . It 's nice to know someone believes in me . I am representing your position to the best of my ability . It is most definitely not my own . I see no persuasive evidence that a life like yours should be wasted simply because you are disgruntled . Frankly , I see no logic to your position . You ... you surprise me , Mr. Tuvok , which is a rare and special gift to a Q. Thank you . But may I say , if only you knew what life as a Q were like , you would see the logic . Then perhaps what we should do next is take this hearing to see life in the Continuum itself . Captain 's Log , supplemental . I 'm determined to find a better alternative to suicide or endless prison , so I 've summoned the advocate Q to make him a proposal . Yes , what is it , Captain ? Come to the next session of the hearing and announce that the Continuum is ready to reintegrate Q into your society ... that you won 't condemn him to that cell for eternity . And you will rule in our favor ? I would consider it a very meaningful gesture by the Continuum . How would you know if I intended to keep my word ? Based on my research , you have been many things ... a rude , interfering , inconsiderate , sadistic ... You 've made your point . ... pest ! And , oh , yes ... you introduced us to the Borg ... thank you very much ... but one thing you have never been is a liar . I think you 've uncovered my one redeeming virtue . Am I blushing ? I wish I could help you , Kathy , I just can 't . We 're dealing here with the most dangerous man in the Continuum . Now , I didn 't tell you this , but one of his self-destructive stunts created a misunderstanding which ignited the 100-year war between the Romulans and the Vulcans . No . This man goes back into his confinement , but ... I would like to make it easier for you . The Continuum is prepared to do you a little favor ... if we approve of your ruling . Look out the window . Now you see it , now you don 't . We are prepared to illustrate the nature of Q 's suffering , Captain , but in order to do so , we must show this hearing what life is like in the Continuum . And how do you intend to do that ? By going to the Continuum itself . Is this possible ? No , it 's a ridiculous idea . You would never understand . My client has the right to ask for an inspection of the living conditions that lead to his suffering , Captain . I would agree with that . I suppose you have some crazy idea how to pull this off ? Yes . Only if ... Fine , fine . We 've agreed on a format for this little sojourn , but I still believe it 's ill-advised . I 'll be the judge of that . Whenever you 're ready . No , no . This is the Q Continuum ... a road in a desert ? I told you so . This is a manifestation of the Continuum that we hope falls within your level of comprehension . This way . Good afternoon . I apologize for their lack of hospitality , Captain . We 're not used to visitors here . In fact , you 're the only ones who 've ever come . Then what is the purpose of the road ? The road ... takes us to the rest of the universe , then it leads back here ... an endless circle . This was your existence before your confinement ? I traveled the road many times ... sat on the porch , played the games ... been the dog ... everything . I was even the scarecrow for a while . Why ? Because I hadn 't done it . Oh , we 've all done the scarecrow . Big deal ! I can 't say I entirely understand what I 'm seeing here , but these people don 't seem to be suffering . Well , of course not . They 're happy people ! Happy people ! What 's there to feel sad about ? Look at them . They don 't dare feel sad . If only they could , that would be progress . Oh . The philosopher speaks . When I was a respected philosopher , I celebrated the continuity , the undeviation of Q life . I argued that our civilization had achieved a purity that no other culture had ever approached and it was wonderful ... for a while . At the beginning of the new era , life as a Q was a constant dialogue of discovery and issues and humor from all over the universe , but look at them now . Listen to their dialogue now . I am afraid I cannot hear any . Because it has all been said . Everyone has heard everything , seen everything . They haven 't had to speak to each other in ten millennia . There 's nothing left to say . Well , I don 't know about you , but I appreciate a little peace and quiet now and again . It 's ironic , isn 't it , Q ? I don 't know what you mean . Of course you do . That you , of all people , should be arguing their case . I believe in the ultimate purity of the Q. You , who were banned from the Continuum and made mortal to pay for your crimes ? My penance has ended . I 'm a born-again Q. That life is behind me . What a shame ... because , in many ways , that life inspired me . It did ? I did ? Oh , yes . You never knew that , did you ? You see , Captain , Q rebelled against this existence by refusing to behave himself . He was out of control . He used his powers irresponsibly and all for his own amusement , and he desperately needed amusement because he could find none here at home . And I paid the price for my inappropriate behavior . No , no , we paid the price by forcing you to stop , but for a moment there , you really had our attention ... my attention . You gave us something to talk about , but then you surrendered to the will of the Continuum like a good little Q , and may I say you 've become a fine , upstanding member of the Continuum but I miss the irrepressible Q ... the one who forced me to think . May I borrow this ? This was the beginning of my fall from grace . This was the last edition , by the way . They shut down the presses after I wrote that , but they couldn 't keep me silent . I continued to speak out in favor of self-termination . That 's when he lost his mind and started trying to destroy himself . We had no choice but to confine him but for his own safety . Not for my safety , for theirs . I was the greatest threat the Continuum had ever known . They feared me so much , they had to lock me away for eternity , and when they did that , they were saying that the individual 's rights will be protected only so long as they don 't conflict with the state . Nothing is so dangerous to a society . My life 's work is complete , but they force immortality on me , and when they do that , they cheapen and denigrate my life and all life in the Continuum , all life . Captain , you 're an explorer . What if you had nothing left to explore ? Would you want to live forever under those circumstances ? You want me to prove to you that I suffer in terms that you can equate with pain or disease . Look at us . When life has become futile , meaningless , unendurable , it must be allowed to end . Can 't you see , Captain ? For us , the disease is immortality . We rest our case , Captain . Very well . I 'll make my ruling in the morning . We 'll be in recess until then . Trouble sleeping ? Did you ever try warm Kylerian goat 's milk ? Get out ! Did you think about our offer ? You mean your bribe . Merely an incentive to make the proper decision . It 'll play no part in my deliberations . No . I told them it wouldn 't . That 's why I talked them into giving you what you asked for . You have my word . He won 't go back to the cell . We 'll assign someone to look after him , whatever it takes . It 's what you wanted , isn 't it ? That 's what I wanted . So , you 've won . Let 's celebrate . Just you and me ... the two of us . What ? I 'll take you home . Before you know it , you 'll be scampering across the meadow with your little puppies , the grass beneath your bare feet . A man coming over the hill , way in the distance , waves to you . You run to be in his arms , and as you get closer , you see that it 's ... me . You ? ! Forget Mark . I know how to show a girl a good time . How would you like a ticker tape parade down Sri Lanka Boulevard ? The Captain who brought Voyager back ... a celebrated hero . I never did anything like that for Jean-Luc , but I feel very close to you . I 'm not sure why . Maybe it 's because you have such authority and yet manage to preserve your femininity so well . Leave . We 'll talk about this after the hearing tomorrow . I 've tried to find some way to reconcile all the conflicting emotions I 've felt during this hearing . My own aversion to suicide . My compassion for your situation , Q. It hasn 't been easy . I 've tried to tell myself that this is not about suicide , but about granting asylum , that I am not personally being asked to perform euthanasia , and as technically true as that may be , I cannot escape the moral implications of my choices . I 've also had to consider that a decision to grant asylum , and the subsequent suicide of a Q , might have a significant impact on the Continuum . That such a decision could change the nature of an entire society , whether it be a favorable or unfavorable change , disturbs me greatly . But then there are the rights of the individual in this matter . I don 't believe that you are mentally unbalanced , and I do believe that you are suffering intolerably . Under these conditions , I find it impossible to support immortality forced on an individual by the state . The unforeseen disruption that may occur in the Continuum is not enough , in my opinion , to justify any additional suffering by this individual . So ... I hereby grant you asylum . May I see you in your chambers , Captain ? You 've been in my chambers enough for one visit , sir . A sidebar , Your Honor . Only for a moment . She ruled in my favor . You made a promise . Nothing happened ... nothing ! My powers are gone ! I 'm mortal . Well , so much for ticker tape parades . I 'm not finished . Q ... now that you 're mortal , you have a new existence to explore , an entirely new state of being filled with the mysteries of mortal life , pleasures you 've never felt before . I like this life , Q. You might , too . Think hard before you give it up . This hearing is adjourned . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49301.2 . We have assigned quarters to our new passenger , who has entered his name on our crew manifest as " Quinn . " I 'm anxious to engage him in ship activities as soon as possible . How about Stellar Cartography ? We could shut down Stellar Cartography with all the knowledge he 'd bring to the job . Well , that 's going to be a problem with just about everything we assign him to . There 's got to be something on board that ... Sick Bay to Captain Janeway . Go ahead . Captain , I think you should come down to Sick Bay . Mr. Quinn is here . I 'm afraid he 's dying . There 's nothing you can do ? He 's ingested a rare form of Nogatch hemlock . There is no known cure . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , Captain , but I would only have been pretending to fit in to this mortal existence . This is my final gift to my people . Oh , tell them those were my last words . I dearly thank you for making this poss ... Doctor , do you generally keep samples of fatal poisons in storage ? No . The replicators will not produce them either . So how did he get his hands on Nogatch hemlock ? I got it for him . You assisted his suicide ? Illogical , Tuvok ? I don 't think so . By demanding to end his life , he taught me a little something about my own . He was right when he said the Continuum scared me back in line . I didn 't have his courage or his convictions . He called me " irrepressible . " This was a man who was truly irrepressible . I only hope I make a worthy student . I imagine the Continuum won 't be very happy with you , Q. I certainly hope not . Au revoir , Madam Captain . We will meet again .

I sent elsewhere . Quitting can help you here . I tried to help Emma . Why did you help ? Because 're Cade Foster . Emma told me all about you . - You forgot something . - What ? Your leg , Gua ! Come on , Foster , even if you pass me Your people will catch you . Anyway , get the files . If it took the fire escape would have sounded the alarm . Willet mind . - Why would he do that ? - Where is ? We think it is somewhere in the basement . Let us ! Foster ªtiindu him dead , no longer have one concern . Why would risk appearing here ? Thi-I said it 's a psycho . These files are very important . You were careless lose them . It was not me . - A deserter Gua ? - A traitor . Led your experiment , 117 . Having escaped and was obviously gave fail . - Took files as collateral . - Do not think that helped . There are too tolerant with those who give it fail . You had no idea where to bail ?

I lost my innocence and proof of alien invasion plans . Now the police know that are alive . Although I missed , it was worth the risk . Gua know that I have not stopped . I will take every opportunity to bring them down . And then we 'll see who is on the run . We immediately go dark . To read it Frank Sinatra ... " Chicago will be a time our city . " That 's good , man . Uniforms began to irritate me . - ' re Not alone . - I liked it . - So I risked nothing . - Maybe not . We lost folders that could help us to stop the Mabus , and policemen still think you are a criminal . Not all . You think Gavin will be on your side ? A body found . If those files reads , we may have a follower . - Is one type , Foster . - Emma was alone . Look what he did . He sacrificed himself to help us . It is sometimes sufficient . FBI take over the investigation . There will be silent until you consider what we have here . Rãmãºiþele will rise in about an hour . We receive a report , the government will consider this ... body . - Or whatever . - I want to see those files . I 'd like to help you , Gavin , but the FBI has already taken . It no longer matters . Anyway , it 'll catch Cade Foster . I sincerely hope to do . There is and something else ? The body will be destroyed in this afternoon , right ? Make sure that Gavin will not see those files .

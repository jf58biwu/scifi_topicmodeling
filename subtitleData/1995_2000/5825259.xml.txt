I can feel it invading my system . It 's happening my my cells . Hi , guys . Bad time ? - Ah . - What 's going on ? Well , I wanted a flower arrangement for my mother , I wished for a bowl of irises . Not ebolo virus . Yikes , sorry , my bad . There , all better . What do you mean , all better , you nearly killed us . I don 't know what happend , I thought a bowl of irised and zapped . It should have been fine . Um ... maybe your techinque needs work . You know , instead of the point and zap thingy you could do this . I could tweek my nose . Oh . This isn 't about technique the point is we can 't keep having our lives threatened everytime we make a wish . I 'm sorry . I didn 't come with an instruction manual . I don 't mean to be a bad genie I really don 't . And I could do a lot better if I could just , just have the answers to a few questions about myself . - Well , we created you , ask us . - Yeah . Nobody knows more about you than we do . Fire away . Okay . Where did I come from ? How does my magic work ? Is God aware of my existence ? I ... um , I don 't know . Don 't look at me . Oh . I didn 't do that . Looks like some kind of cosmic fortune cookie . Visit the Genie Master . All questions answered . Look there 's a map . Somebody up there likes me . That 's where I 'll get my answers . Gere , packed your lunch . Don 't stop at any stray planets , you go straight to that comet and you come right back . I promise . Bye , guys . Oh , I almost forgot . I left a present for you an Wyatt 's bed . I know you are going to have a lot of fun with it while I 'm away . - A gift ? - Whahoo ! I 'm going to open it , sucker . Not without me you 're not . Nice . Hello ? - Oh ! - Scared you I did . - A little . - Tricked you , made you jump . Yes . - Excite you ? - Don 't push it . Sorry . Lonely am I. On a journey are you ? - Desire you something ? - Answers . Oh , you seek the Great Genie Master . Give you answers he will . - Really ? - Umm ... Can we start right now ? I have so many questions I want to ask you . Me ? No . First find Genie Master . Oh , come on . I know it 's you . Ah , no . Power is he . Small in statue am I. But you 're the one who sent me the fortune cookie , aren 't you ? Of course you 're him . No , he is not here . Far away he is , Yes . Very far .

Got you I did . The stupid thing doesn 't open . Read the card again . " Dear Gary amd Wyatt , this gift is guaranteed fun . " - There 's no instructions ? - Nope . Maybe it 's just stuck . Let me try . It just needs a good kick . I could have told you that wasn 't going to work . - Hey , let 's throw off the roof . - That 's why you 're the brains . Many others like you there are in the universe many others . I want to learn all about them , and about me . Learn you will . But first , pure must a genie spirit be , if entry she is to earn into the maigcal kingdom . Well okay , but if I have to listen to that . It 's a small world song I ain 't going . Niruana is a magical kindgom . Enter and total enlightenment you will receive . Cool . So how do I become pure ? Tests of virtue you must pass , yes . Many tests . - Bring ' em on . - Tomorrow we start . Tonight you rest . Okay . How does one spend an evening on a comet ? In thought and meditation . Considering the metaphysical implications of existence in the universe . - I brought Uno . - Deal . Did it move ? I thought I saw it move . No . It hasn 't moved . It hasn 't done anything and it never will . It 's a useless , worthless total . Cool box . Babe magnet . It 's a babe magnet . What a shape . It 's so smooth and three dimensional . And it looks the same from every side . It 's a perfect cube . - Where 'd you get it ? - Can 't tell you . Oh , come on please . We have to know . Yeah , we 'll do anything that you want . I love this box . Look , those guys have a sphere . Ooh . I hate this box . Discipline you must learn . Concentration . - You 're going to tickle me , aren 't you ? - No . Balance the feather on your nose you will . Still and quiet you will stay until I return . Uh ... Touched you I have not . - I know , but 's gonna tickle . - Concentrate . - Quit it . - All in your mind is the tickling . Is not . - Is too ! - Is not ! Is too ! Failed you have . - Doesn 't tickle . Huh . - Ha ha ! - Doesn 't tickle . - Ha ha ! Only the pure of spirit can create absolute beauty . Pure , perfect . Conjure this you can ? As well as . Ah . It 's got a little cottage inside you see . And it snows too . Hmm . That 's pure beauty if you ask me . Hmm . You 're watching static ? What 's up with that commercials on the weather channel ? - Can 't change it . - Remotes over there . So . Get up , get it . If I get up , I 'll never get my space back on the box . - Gary . - Box . That 's right . Just plain old box , nothing special about it . Completely functional . Lisa made it , didn 't she , I want in . - No . - No , she made it for us . At least let me look at it . Back off , man , just you back off . Whoa ! Okay . Okay , your box . It must be one hell of a box . I got the box . So , what 's it do ? Every test have you failed . Of course I did . I 'm a lousy genie , that 's why I came here for help and now I 'm never going to get my questions answered . Fear not . Exceptions there are . Really ? One final test there can be . If accomplished pure you become . Like a bonus round ? Difficult and arduous it will be . Face your deapest fears . I 'm not afraid . You will be . You will be . - Be what ? - What ? - You said I 'd be something . - Afraid . - I 'm not afraid . - You will be , you will be . Stop yelling , you 're scaring me . I 'm scared , can 't you come with me ? Alone you must be . Trust in all you have learned . But I haven 't learned anything . Oh , if I get into trouble I can always zap myself out . No , magic you must not use . Or fail you will . No magic ? What if I can 't do it ? Fond of you I am . Confidence I have . Go . Fifty , fifty chance I give . Okay , Lisa , you can do this , be brave , answers you 've longed for will finally be yours . GENIE MASTER : Face your fears or fail you will . Oh , shush . Why can 't be talk like a normal person . Face your fears got to face your fears . Fears , fears , fears . Well , I 'm not scared anymore , I 'm cold , hungry and pissed when I see that runt again I 'm going to give him some fear . - Aah ! - Ah , hobgoblin . Thought she would pass this one I did . I failed again , didn 't I ? Tried to make it easy I did . Now I will never knoe what I am all about . I failed at everything . I failed myself . I should just go . - Wait there is another way . - Really , what ? More tests ? Strenouus training ? The well thought outconsidered opinion of a high tribunal ? Call it in ther air you will . I 'm good at this . Tails . Best two out three it should be . Boys , I 'm afraid this black box of yours has caused quite a disturbance here at Farbor . As you know I have a duty to maintain order . Therefore since classes have been disrupted , hallways congested , not ot mention the fact that certain undesirable followed you here because of it , I 'm confiscating your box . Now I want you to return to your classrooms Chester to whatever hole he crawled out of . Couldn 't we just stay here and , uh ... be with the box ... ? - No . - You don 't understand . We need it . We have to have it . You can pick it up at the end of the day . You always were a funbuster . Then I suggest you all seek counselling in regard to this unhealthy obsession with this simple wooden object . Good day , gentlemen . Good day , gentlemen . - Best eleven out of twenty . - Heads . Yes , heads it is , passed you have . Of course . I 'm so good . Do I get move on now ? No . There is one more thing . Celebrate we must . Master . Will you tell me what I want to know ? Help you if I can . Did Gary and Wyatt make me or did the universe make me for them ? Sent by the universe to help the boys you were . All that you are , created you they did . Is that why my magic is so unreliable ? A genie 's magic drawn from within it is . Spontanious and unpredictable you are . And your magic follows suit . So I 'm stuck forever with a crumby zapper . Find your mistakes endearing , some do . No more questions will I answer . All will be revealed in the Magic Kingdom . It 's beautiful . Always difficult to say goodbye . Not goodbye more like so long . This is a one way trip . Once you enter the Magic Kingdom forever will you be it 's guest . But what about Gary and Wyatt ? Do they need you still ? No longer are they the tragic social outcasts thay once they were . Oh , come on . They weren 't that bad . Lisa 's memory is not as long as her legs . Dweebs , they were . Losers . They have turned out , okay , haven 't they ? Yes , well , you have done your job . Now the Magic Kingdom awaits you . Answer lie within . Go . Can I just see them one more time before I leave ? I 'm the king of the box and I bring you no chance . Now , I Wyatt am king of the box . Hey , you said we were going to be cokings . You fell for it , sucker . All hail King Wyatt . Sure looks like , they 're having fun . Is the Magic Kingdom fun ? Perfection and knowledge await you . But Gary and Wyatt will be there not . Now you 've got me doing it . Infectious I am . Hurry you should . But I 'm not ready to go . Longed for this you have . I can 't leave my friends . I want to follow that rainbow , just not right now . Maybe Gary and Wyatt don 't need me any longer but I still need them . Hm . Then passed the most important test of all you have . - What 's that ? - Accepted yourself you have . Know your mind you do . A better genie you will be . This comet return it will in 100 years . It 's a date . Well , it 's good to hear your trip was a success . Glad we have an unbroken genie . Turns out I wasn 't broken to begin with . So how did you like your present ? Ah , are you kidding ? We loved it . This is the best thing you 've ever zapped up . You have no idea what it is . - No . - Not a clue . Well , first you have to activate it . I 'm Kelly . I like shy intelectual types with limited social skills . Ah . Hi , I 'm Rachel and I like guys with 8 inch biseps and poofy hair . Wait till you see my 4 inch calfs . This is the best gift ever . What happened ? You guys just clapped off . They 're not coming back , are they ? Come back ! Come back ! Captioned by Grant Brown

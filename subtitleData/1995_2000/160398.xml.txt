 - Dr. Cabrera . - Where is he ? Down in Trauma . They said you 'd know what 's wrong with him . - Who transferred him from I.C.U. ? - I did . He was scheduled for , uh , therapeutic plasmapheresis . - They were prepping him . He went into shock . - What are his vitals ? Not good . Pulse is 40 . Blood pressure 80 / 50 . His G.C.S. is six . Okay . Get on the phone to the F.B.I. - There 's an Agent Scully that should be notified . - F.B.I. ? - This man is an F.B.I. agent . - Well , what 's wrong with him ? What 's wrong with him is he 's going to die . [ Monitor Beeping ] Can you hear me ? Mr. Skinner ? I 'm not understanding . Can you speak up ? [ Whispering Indistinctly ] - What 'd he say ? - A name . [ Continuous Beep ] He 's coding on us . Clear . Dr. Cabrera , clear . Dr. Cabrera ! Let him go . [ Beep Continues ] [ Skinner Narrating ] Every minute of every day we choose ... who we are , who we forgive , who we defend and protect , : to choose a side or to walk the line , : to play the middle , : to straddle the fence between what is and what should be . This was the course I chose- - trying to find the delicate balance of interests ... that can never exist . Choosing by not choosing . Defending a center which cannot hold . So death chose for me . [ Trainer ] Good aim ! Good aim ! Move around ! Move around ! Go easy on him , slugger . I need him to lock up for me tonight , okay ? [ Buzzer Sounding ] [ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Grunting ] Don 't telegraph that left , Dre . Stevie Wonder would see that one comin ' . You 're fighting the F.B.I. now , Dre . Fight smart . Go ! [ Groaning ] [ Panting ] Hey , slugger . You okay ? Slugger , can you hear me ? Talk to me . You all right ? - Slugger . - [ Woman ] Mr. Skinner . Mr. Skinner . Hi . - You gonna stick with us now ? - [ Exhaling ] Do you remember what happened ? I was boxing . I must 've gotten tagged . Yes , you did . At least you didn 't get your ear bit off . That 's something , right ? Dr. Plant will be with you in a minute . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Yeah . Skinner . Hello ? [ Electronic Voice ] Walter ... Skinner . - Who is this ? - Have you heard ... the news ? It 's ... in ... you . - What is this ? - You ... have ... 2 4 hours to go . What is this ? What do you want ? You ... are ... already dead . Mr. Skinner . Didn 't expect to see you up and around . You must be feeling better . Can you take a seat on the table for me , please ? [ Groans ] I 'm Dr. Plant . I was here with you before . - You probably don 't remember . - No . Well , the good news is your dilation 's back to normal . Plus you still have both your ears . [ Chuckles ] I heard that one . I 'm gonna release you . But I suggest that you rethink the boxing . You 're not 20 anymore . There 's nothing wrong with me ? Well , you got your bell rung . Other than that , I think you 're fine . Might want to ice that bruise . What bruise ? Right here . - How the hell did I get that ? - Must 've taken a hard one to the ribs . But there 's nothing broken . No internal bleeding . Like I said , you 'll live . Thanks . [ Skinner ] What is it , Agent Mulder ? I just , uh- - I thought I 'd poke my head in and say hey . Hey . What , are you sleeping one off ? No , I was just having trouble seeing . It 's nothing . I just didn 't think I should drive . You gonna be all right , sir ? [ Mulder ] He 's gonna tell you he 's all right . That 's because there 's nothing wrong with me . Not that I could tell if there was . Why are all the lights out ? He 's having trouble with his eyes . He 's also got a nasty bruise on his rib cage . - What did you do ? - It 's nothing . - Says who ? - Says the doctor who released me from the hospital . - [ Groans ] - That was the second opinion . The first was unsolicited . A phone call at the hospital . A scrambled voice telling him he had 2 4 hours to live . That was somebody yanking my chain . - Look , I got a clean bill of health . - Hey , hey , hey . [ Sighs ] In the last 48 hours , did you eat or drink ... anything that tasted metallic or otherwise odd ? Oh , come on . You think that I 'm poisoned ? Did the doctor take your blood ? Yes , and it checked out . Well , if you were poisoned , it could have been overlooked . Well , if it did , why call and tell me at the hospital ? To scare you . See what you 'd do , who you 'd turn to . Oh . [ Scoffs ] This is about you . Or about the X-Files . You are so paranoid , Mulder . You 're not even on the X-Files anymore . [ Sighs ] I know , but you are . You still supervise them . What happened today ? Anything out of the ordinary ? - I 'm not gonna play this game . - Look , it could 've been anything . It could 've been the slightest touch or a handshake . - This morning , you woke up- - - I woke up . - Alone ? - Yes , alone . - How 'd you get to the office ? - The same way that I always do- - I drove . - And then what ? - Then nothing . I had some meetings , I went to the gym , to the hospital , and now I 'm here . Just slow down . One step at a time . - How 'd you get from the parking garage to your office ? - The elevator . And then what ? [ Sighs ] I walked up the hallway . I passed the same dozen people that I pass every morning . I went to my office . I said " " good morning " " to my secretary . She said " " good morning " " to me . I returned some calls , I did some paperwork , then I was here for the rest of the day . Now , think . There 's got to be something . [ Skinner ] In the hallway , there was a man . He stopped me . He wanted to know the time . Did he touch you ? He grabbed me ... on my right wrist . Well , it wouldn 't necessarily leave a mark . Some poisons are absorbed through the skin . What time was it ? There you are . That 's him . Right there . Wait a second . Back up . It can 't be . That 's Kenneth Orgel . An advisor to a senate subcommittee on ethics and new technology . - He 's a scientist ? - Aphysicist . Very well known as far as physicists go . He signed in here as a visitor to the office ... of Assistant Director Walter Skinner . Why would he be coming to see you ? I 'd like to ask him that myself . Sir , if this man poisoned you , you should be off your feet and under a doctor 's care . If this man poisoned me , I 'm gonna put a gun to his head , find out why , and ask him how he 's gonna make me well . - What hospital was he at ? - St. Katherine 's . - Yes ? - Dr. Orgel ? - Kenneth Orgel ? - Yes . Do you know who I am ? No . My name 's Walter Skinner . I 'm an assistant director at the F.B.I. Dr. Orgel , you visited the F.B.I. this morning . You came to see Mr. Skinner . No , uh , you must be mistaken . I 'm sorry . You 'll have to come back another time . - Go around back . - What ? Please . You 're bothering me . Federal agent ! [ Groans ] - Go ! - [ Gunshot ] [ Engine Starting ] Drop the gun . Drop it ! [ Speaking Foreign Language ] Yeah . So 's your mom . Hey , give it a rest , huh ? - Let him go , Agent Mulder . - What ? He 's got diplomatic papers . It 's our mistake . You can go . Just let him go . Get in the house . The police are gonna be here any moment . I don 't have time to stand around and answer any questions . His name is Alexander Lazreg- - L-A-Z-R-E-G . He 's the cultural attache with the Tunisian mission here in D.C. - See what else you can find out about him . - You need to get to a hospital . No , I 'm trying to stay out of one . - The boxer- - F.B.I. - Yes . You released him from your care earlier this evening . Is he not all right ? Well , that 's why I 'm here . He may have been poisoned . You 're kidding . By who ? I don 't know . In fact , I 'm not even sure what I 'm looking for . Well , you 're lucky . He 's on the government H.M.O. No one 's even bothered to handle his samples yet . Is this them in here ? I 'm not supposed to let you have those- - not without a- - a written release from the patient . We may not have time . He may not have time either . He had absolutely no symptoms of poisoning . Are you sure these haven 't been processed ? I 'm not sure , but I doubt they 've even been touched . I 'm not so sure you should be doing that . This is a crime scene . What would you rather I be doing ? It 's just that I 'm concerned for Dr. Orgel 's personal property ... and the preservation of evidence . I 'd be a lot more concerned with the preservation of Dr. Orgel . Hello , Senator . It 's carbon . Pure carbon . How in the world would that get into his bloodstream ? And how is it working as a poison ? By all rights , it shouldn 't be . Look at them--just rattling around in the solution . [ Dr. Plant ] It 's just bizarre . Did you see that ? - Did you just touch something ? - No , I didn 't . They just multiplied . Look . It just did it again . Zooming in . What the hell are they ? Wait here , please . I don 't have to tell you how late it is , do I , Agent Mulder ? But I suspect that wasn 't even a consideration of yours . Actually , time is my only consideration , Senator . This was taken only three days ago . It 's of you and Dr. Kenneth Orgel holding a senate resolution . S.R. 81 9 , I think it 's called . What is that ? A funding bill . What is this all about ? A friend of mine is going to die because of S.R. 81 9 . I don 't know how , I don 't even know why , but I 'm betting you do . - What are you talking about ? - I don 't even really know yet . All I have are a few pieces- - a Tunisian diplomat , this Dr. Kenneth Orgel , this health bill , S.R. 81 9- - all leading up to a plot to kill an assistant director of the F.B.I. - Does that make sense ? - The bill you 've referred to ... will provide money and supplies to the World Health Organization . Medical technology to third world countries . I have aided you in the past ... with information , Fox , and advice , which right now is to leave here at once ... and never again suggest to anyone my involvement ... in any such dark intrigue . Am I understood ? This man may die . He may only have a few hours to live . My intention is to save lives , Fox , but I can 't save his . Good night , Fox . Drive safely . [ Gunshot ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Skinner Groaning ] [ Car Alarm Blaring ] - Dr. Plant ? - What ? - What is it ? - I think I found it . I think I found what the carbon 's doing . It 's , uh , it 's not just reproducing itself . It has behavior . It 's-It 's creating something . A-A matrix stimulated by blood flow in response to movement . It 's multiplying , then solidifying in an orderly fashion . It 's building valves or-or dams in the vascular system . It 's building a heart attack . - [ Door Opens ] - Dr. Plant ? - You 're doing blood work on a Walter Skinner ? - Yes . I just heard on the radio there 's a Walter Skinner who 's been picked up ... by paramedics at a parking garage downtown . - Where are they taking him ? - D.C. General . Did you see this ? We 've got some sort of extreme vascular event here . How is he even still alive ? We 'll take the left arm first . Mark it just above the bicep . - Let 's get to it . - I 'll get this side . Hey , you , out . - I know this man . - I don 't care . This is a sterile operating room . - Get these people out . - Look , I 'm sorry . His name is Walter Skinner . We 've been investigating his illness . What are you doing ? If he 's gonna live , he 's gonna have to lose his arms . - No , that 's not gonna save him . It 's his blood . - Who the hell is this woman ? - She 's a doctor . - You 're not gonna solve anything until you get a scope into him . Nothing else is gonna work . Look , if you want to save this man , listen to what I 'm saying . It 's okay , sir . Lie back down . We 're just moving you to another room . [ Exhales ] Who did this to me ? That 's what Mulder 's trying to figure out right now . But we 're gonna take good care of you . I promise . We 're gonna do everything we can . I don 't know . I can 't remember . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Clattering ] Sir ? Is that you ? - Agent Mulder ! - Hey , do you have the key to this drawer ? - What are you doing ? - A.D. Skinner 's in the hospital . - Somebody poisoned him . - Poisoned him ? Why ? - For doing his job . - I-I don 't understand . I 'm looking for anything that relates to a senate resolution- - S.R. 81 9 . If you want to save his life , you 'll help me open this drawer . - I don 't have the key . - You have a letter opener ? In your desk ? Something ? Is he going to be all right ? - What 's his condition ? - He 's stable , but it 's not good , Mulder . He 's got extreme vascular trauma and distension . His-His blood has become a weapon against his body . Well , can you fight it ? We don 't know what it is . I mean , the best that we can do ... is keep lasering his arteries open . But it 's only gonna be a matter of time before we lose . I mean , it 's-it 's building walls in his vessels ... faster than we can tear them down , and-and we just don 't have the technology to combat it . - Maybe we do . - What is this ? I found this in Skinner 's morning mail . He was doing a security check on a senate bill ... for violation of trade laws involving sensitive technology . Yeah , but this is just a routine procedure , Mulder . - The F.B.I. does dozens of these a year . - No . This bill was gonna vote in the senate . All it was waiting on ... was Skinner 's review and an analysis by Dr. Kenneth Orgel . You 're saying that Dr. Orgel ... poisoned Skinner in order to cover up his analysis ? No , Orgel didn 't poison anybody . Orgel came to the F.B.I. to tell Skinner what he knew- - that there was a gross violation of export laws involving new technology . - New technology . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] You know what that means ? Well , I think I might . - [ Ringing Continues ] - That 's not me . You want to get this ? It was in his pants pocket . Thank you . Hello ? [ Electronic Voice ] Might as well ... give up . - Who is it ? - It 's a computer synth voice . You can 't ... stop it . Somebody that must know he 's here . Walter Skinner , your time- - Federal agent ! Stop right there ! Sir ! Hey ! [ Car Door Closes ] [ Tires Screeching ] - [ Tires Screeching ] - [ Horn Honking ] [ Crash ] [ Shouting In Spanish ] [ Ringing ] - Yes . - [ Man ] The bill is in danger , Senator . A new threat has emerged . - You shouldn 't have called me . - Blood will be on your hands . I don 't buy your hollow threats . Well , Dr. Orgel does . You can ask him . What have you done with him ? I can tell you where to find him . The car is leased . Part of a fleet service ... that services the diplomatic counsel corps . What other forensic evidence were you able to lift ? Not much on the outside . It 's not surprising , considering the condition of the vehicle . Inside we found a couple hairs- - human- - from an expensive wig . Don 't hate me ' cause I 'm beautiful . What else ? Well , we scraped the tire treads . Found something odd . It 's full of polychlorinated biphenyls- - P.C.B.s. Over 500 parts per million . Now , that 's the kind of levels we used to see in the 1 97 0s . - Right before the E.P.A. got fangs . - From where ? Well , the P.C.B.s are saturated evenly in the clay . Uh , demo site , maybe , or , uh , an old power plant . [ Door Closes ] Who 's there ? Is someone there ? Senator , please , let me go . [ Gasping ] I need ... water . - Who did this to you ? - Hurry . Please . It 's ... killing me . They believe you 've exposed them to the F.B.I.- - to Walter Skinner . No . I told the F.B.I. nothing . I told them nothing . Please . I promise not to expose anyone . [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Sir , there 's something I 'd like to try . It 's a treatment called therapeutic plasmapheresis . It requires filtering all of the blood in your body . It 's a radical procedure , and there is a danger ... that your body might go into shock . I 'm in your hands . I think I owe you an apology , Scully . - You and Mulder . - Sir ? I 've been lying here thinking . Your quest ... it should have been mine . What do you mean ? If I die now , I die in vain . I have nothing to show for myself . My life- - Sir , you know that 's not true . It is . I can see now that ... I always played it safe . I wouldn 't take sides . Wouldn 't let you and Mulder ... pull me in . You 've been our ally more times than I can say . Not the kind of ally that I could have been . - I remember now . - What ? I can 't see his face . He has a beard . Try . [ Skinner ] He was at the gym . At the hospital . He killed that man . He was at the F.B.I. when Orgel approached me . He was following you ? The tape . He 's on the surveillance tape . You must be surprised to see me here . I 'm sure I 'm not the man you 're looking for . Where is he ? Where 's Orgel ? - Orgel is dead . - I don 't believe you . You lied to me this morning , you 're lying to me now . - Drop this , Fox . - Where is Orgel ? I need to know what he knows . A friend of mine is dying . I tell you , they killed him . What Orgel knows died with him . Tell me what you know , Senator ! This is about S.R. 81 9 , isn 't it ? What the hell did they put in Skinner ? I 'm sure you already have some idea , Fox . It 's the same technology that S.R. 81 9 will export . Technology that the world believes is purely theoretical . Nanotechnology . Microscopic , atom-sized machines ? - Machines can be stopped . - Your friend is already dead . - I don 't believe that . - If you pursue this , Fox , they will kill you . Not before I expose you and your role in this . My role ? I am a victim here . Don 't you understand that ? I 'm fighting for my life ! I will stop this ! It 's too late , Fox . It 's too late ! [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Continuous Beep ] All right . He 's coding on us . Clear . Dr. Cabrera , clear . - Dr. Cabrera ! - Let him go . Call time of death- - 9 : 33 . [ Gasping , Coughing ] Sir , I 've spoken with your doctors , and your prognosis is excellent . Whatever you are infected with appears to be dormant . And your recovery is being hailed as a miracle . The man who poisoned you was at the F.B.I. that day . Scully was able to pull these off the security videotapes . Hoping it might jog your memory . Maybe you can identify this man . No , I 'm sorry . S.R. 81 9 was withdrawn by committee late last night without explanation . Good . So this man failed then ? If that was his true motive . If he wanted to poison you to prevent you from investigating S.R. 81 9 , why call you to tell you that ? This man worked for the government that was to receive this technology . He drove one of their cars , and he killed one of his own to save you . So you still think this is about you ? About the X-Files ? Yes . Yes , I do , and I have an idea who may be behind all this . But I 'd need your authority to continue the investigation . I have neither the authority nor the will ... to allow your continued inquiry into this matter . You 'll perform your duties as directed by A.D. Kersh , and only A.D. Kersh . Sir ? This matter 's closed , agents . Am I clear ? [ Alarm Chirps ] I 've been expecting you to show up . You know I can push the button any time . What do you want from me ? What 's this about , Krycek ? All in good time . [ Child ] I made this !

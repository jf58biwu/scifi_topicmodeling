( LAUGHS ) This is not a human child . Well , I 'm not ready to jump to that conclusion . The ear configuration and cranial shape are definitely Newcomer . What are you saying ? Half human , half Newcomer ? A hybrid ? I thought that was impossible . Tenctonese have been known to genetically adapt ... in a single generation . Interbreeding may be just a matter of time .

Cardiac and respiratory rates are up , blood pressure 's down . Why ? I don 't know . Her physiological status is unknown . She 's very difficult to evaluate . Her arterial oxygen saturation is normal for a Newcomer , but it would be fatal to a human . Well , the giant is still out . I had blood tissue and culture samples taken . They 're on the way over now . What about Grazer ? The hospital 's gotten a court order . I 've told them that they can 't move her . Good . Is it possible the giant is the child 's father ? Of course . I 've already started some DNA Testing . It 's also possible the giant was a patient of Chorboke . Yes-particularly after the images that Albert described . And if he is the father , perhaps further testing can help identify the mother . It could . Matt , are you still there ? Uh , yeah . Could you pick me up at the hospital tonight for our class ?

Matt , you can 't always count on a cheap meal ... and intoxicating beverages to substitute for foreplay . Look . We 're on company time here . We 've got murders to solve . Tivoli 's daughter came into town . She said she 'd meet us at Tivoli 's estate . GEORGE : LAPD We 're here to see Miss Tivoli . This way , please . Detectives . Welcome . Miss Tivoli . You wear the robes of a penitent . Yes . My mother 's house is not my home . I belong to a group in the north . We try to help Newcomers who are having difficulty assimilating into your society . Please . My mother overcame so much . She accomplished so much . Were you close with her ? Not particularly . You 've , uh , given up a lot . Miss Tivoli , do you know what your mother did on the ship ? Is this related to her death ? We think her murder may involve a ... a survivor from Special Section . My mother 's disease , her good work here on Earth ... She tried to give penance . For what ? My mother should be remembered for what she did here . If you can forget what she was , I may be able to help you . Yes . Aboard the ship she was Kleezantsun . An Overseer ? She worked in Special Section . Her name was Vesant . Chorboke 's second-in-command . She believed that Chorboke 's work would advance our species ... would save us from suffering and disease . Later she wanted to create a purely mental being ... a being free from the baser needs of the body ... a mind and a soul free to learn , to create , to explore . Well , if the giant is an example of her handiwork , I 'd say she fell a little short . Unfortunately she did . You should investigate a man named Roger Benson . ( TYPING ) " Benson . " I can 't believe I stood next to Vesant ... Come on . Lighten up . Talked with her . You didn 't know . I would have killed her myself . Would 've , could 've , should 've .

It isn 't something you sit around and talk about in front of a bunch of strangers . Sex is the most natural form of expression there is . Why are you so embarrassed by it ? Look , let 's just try it my way . Just one more time : A little wine , a little sour milk , some music . We 'll take it slow and easy . All right , a lot of wine , a lot of sour milk . We don 't need these other guys ... We need to understand each other 's bodies , Matt . Ignorance is not bliss ! Well ... You better decide if you 're willing to make the same commitment to me ... that I am to you . ( NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE ) ( TYPING ) " Overseer war criminals interrogated . " ( TYPING CONTINUES ) CIA . Benson . Francisco . Captain . We talked with Tivoli 's daughter . Forget about Tivoli . You don 't understand . No , you don 't understand . We 're off the case . There is no case ... national security . I 've just been with the chief . The feds are coming in the morning ... and you are to turn over all ... and I mean all-the paperwork . They 're gonna take Godzilla and the kid as soon as they overturn that hospital order . But it 's our jurisdiction . I think they 're trying to cover up something . Listen to me . They 're not trying to do anything . They 're doing it . Do you wanna be a crossing guard , George ? Have the stuff ready in the morning . You talked to Buck about his aklafluid release ? Yes ! And ? He told me to mind my own business . You know , he 's still grumbling about that strange hybrid child . ( OPENING , CLOSING DOORS ) Think he 's focused all his resentment on Matt and Cathy . ( SLAMS CABINET DOOR ) Where 's the damn mustard ? George . I have one cup of coffee , and when I need a little mustard for it , it 's not . Who does the shopping around here anyway ? ( SIGHS ) Oh . You wanna talk about it ? Ah , I thought it was behind us ... Chorboke , the unthinkable . Grazer won 't let me pursue it . He 's caving in to somebody or-or something . Buck , when 's your father 's car due back ? Your master cylinder 's shot . ( CONTAINER CLATTERS ) They 're waitin ' for the part . Sorry . Look , I 'm late for class . I 'll see you . What are you gonna do ? I don 't know . They can 't just drop the case . Well , of course they can . They are . " National security , " my ass . It 's file-and-forget time . I suspect so . I found Benson in an old newspaper , probably before they put the pot on . " Lid on , " George . Benson was CIA , in charge of Overseer scientists . No further references to him . The government issued a report about six months later . All known surviving Overseer war criminals ... charged and convicted by human-Newcomer tribunal-life sentences . No mention of Chorboke and his butchers in , uh , Special Section ? No . Officially , I guess we haven 't much choice . Unofficially ... Hey , guys . Seems to be a lot of streets in this town called Prairie . Lookin ' for the 9400 block . Yeah , uh ... ( MUFFLED BURST ) ( GROANS ) Out . ( TIRES SQUEALING ) My partner ... What happens to him and to you eventually ... depends upon how well you listen ... and understand . ( BIRDS CHIRPING IN DISTANCE ) A good beginning . You want to pay strict heed to the orders of your superiors , Detective . Despite your overwhelming urge to investigate the Dextra homicides ... you should do ... nothing further . The child and her large companion will soon be the responsibility of another authority . You will get on with your life , your work ... your wonderful family . Your anger , your frustration will , in time , pass . You 're a fine officer and , I suspect , an excellent card player . Surely you have an appreciation of odds , probabilities , " when to hold ' em and when to fold ' em , " as we say around the poker table ? Susan 's eighth-floor corner office a bit small for her growing responsibilities , by the way ... is a particularly vulnerable location . Buck a passionate , lad is random , impulsive ... out ... every day . Emily her routine is so predictable ( GRUNTS ) So full of life and hope . And little Vesna . Who knows what wonders await one so well nurtured ? It can be as simple to execute as your appearance here ... as crude as a rocket launcher ... as insidious as a master cylinder ... which is programmed to detonate upon command . You 've made your point , Mr. Benson . " A man with sensibilities , once his heart is touched ... " loses all traces of habit to guide his actions ... and how can he follow a path he 's forgotten all about ? " Stendhal . Sensible and well read . I know you 'll make the right decision , Detective . ( MUFFLED BURST ) ( INHALES ) ( EXHALES ) George ? George ! Come on , now . Talk to me , man . George ? Huh ? ( COUGHS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) George ? You okay , man ? Matt . We 're all right . You 're all right , George . We 're both all right . Oh , man . Last thing I remember I was ... I was playing Mr. Auto Club , then the lights went out . We still got our guns . The car isn 't stripped . I was taken away . I ... I-I don 't know where . A private home , very expensive , I think . No , there was a man , Benson . Benson , I think . He ... told me to drop case , forget everything I know . Did he hurt you , George ? No . No . But he made me afraid , as afraid as I 've ever been in my life ... as helpless as I 've ever felt . He knows everything : Susan and Buck and , and Vesna and-and Emily , where they go , what they do . He ... He told me that if I didn 't do what he said , that they would be killed . But Matt , if ... if I do what they want ... I might as well give up my badge . All this muscle from people who know how to use it . The other side , they 're playin for big stakes , but George ... my guess is , they 're as scared as you are . Matt , that won 't keep my family alive . I assure you , Mr. Turner , the generals will not be disappointed . But OPSIL has been compromised . Some of our people are very nervous . Forgive me . I can sell this weapon to anyone . Look , we 're-we 're holding up our end . Justice is picking up the giant . There 'll be no more police investigation , believe me . No more press . Then relax . I 've eliminated my problems . The implosion weapon will surpass all the other toys we 've developed for you . Francisco , this is Agent Felker , Justice Department . Here 's the case files on Jones , Tivoli and Penn : Lab reports , forensics ... photographs , canvassing witnesses . Yeah , that 's fine , Detective . We don 't need an inventory . Trace evidence , personal property . And the weapon is in the ... Look , I 've already been to the evidence locker . And I need your field notebook , Sikes 's too . That 's right , Rene , Code Five . It 's gotta be off the books . Hell , I know you hate retirement . What about a snitch list , Detective ? Any police informants involved ? No , sir . That 's right , Harry . I said , my partner . Good . I knew I could count on you . Hey , give Bernie a call at the sheriff 's office , will ya ? The more the merrier . You 've been online for some of this stuff . These are the only copies . The hard drive has been erased . I 'll verify that . Thank you , Captain . Hey , Tina . Hmm . What 's this ? Uh , Narcotics is shorthanded . We got some crack house bust tonight . Whew . Place must be a damn fortress . Grenade launchers ? Sniper scopes ? Oh , man . Armor-piercing . You 're lucky . I just got some in . Hard drive 's clean . We 'll take the giant into custody now , Captain . An armored car is on its way . I think he should be checked by Dr Frankel . He seems ... That 's all , Detective . You can go . ( CHATTERING QUIETLY ) Agnes ? Matt Sikes . Isn 't it about time for another graduation ? I thought so . Listen , I was hoping you 'd be up for a little tactical exercise ... before you send ' em into the field . Great . I 'll call back in an hour with details . And believe me , I appreciate your help . This looks like a very dangerous assignment , Sergeant . Only for the wrong people , Albert . The armored car is here . You guys don 't want to carry these down ? Certainly . Albert ? Zapeda ! Where 's the damn giant ? I don 't know . I thought he was transferred to federal custody . ( CHUCKLES ) ( CHATTERING ) We were pulled from the case . The government was coming for him , trying to get the child . Matt and I thought that ... Matt doesn 't think at all . Listening to him could cost you your job and put you in a jail cell . Don 't give up on him , Cathy . I put everyone I hold dear in his hands . He has only one heart , George . Like the child . She 's not a child . Her DNA was very peculiar , so I ran a femur X-ray . She 's a 30-year-old woman . What ? The girl is 30 years old . Then she would have been on the ship . But what about her development ? I ran a cell comp on both the child and the giant . I-I reran the test . I couldn 't believe it myself . What ? Believe what ? They 're twins , George ... identical twins . Well , they can 't be twins , let alone identical . Look , genetically identical . They are two halves of the same organism . Albert 's visions . They must both be from Special Section . Chorboke 's ... work . Tivoli 's daughter said that they were trying to create pure intellect . Tivoli must have been carrying on Chorboke 's experiments ... trying to separate one being into two . The child must be the other half of Tivoli 's experiment . The ultimate brain and the ultimate slave . He didn 't speak until he was holding her hand yesterday . She thinks for him , he moves for her each incomplete without the other . And the tragedy is , they 're both failing . They 're dying , George . I think it 's because they 're apart . ( LABORED BREATHING ) It 's like Albert said . They need each other . They are each other . They share the same soul . I 'm going to get him stabilized , and then I am going to bring her here . I have got to get them together . Yes . I 've got to make sure my family is safe . ( MEN , WOMEN CHATTERING IN DISTANCE ) Halt ! Get ... It 's okay . It 's okay . He 's Detective Francisco . Welcome home , Detective . ( CHATTERING CONTINUES ) MAN : Go around the back and move the light back there . Hey , Dave , check the east window , huh ? You got it . ( DOOR OPENS , CLOSES ) Hey , Buck . Thank you for all this , Matt . Ah , no big deal . Everybody likes your dad . You set it up . Any Tenctonese can 't count on a human that way . He 'd be there for them too . George is a hell of a cop . That 's all they see . Maybe . Buck , the other day-what 'd I do wrong ... other than being human ? ( SIGHS ) Well , that was it actually . ( CHUCKLES ) Bein ' a human ? And hitting on Cathy . ( QUIETLY ) Ah . Ready to bag a Newcomer , huh ? Hey , I care about Cathy . Isn 't just about sex . Honest . She 's better than that . Yes , she is . Do you understand the consequences ? What do you mean ? If there is such thing as a hybrid ... it could mean the extinction of my species . Matt ... ( VOICE BREAKING ) That would be a great tragedy . ( CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO ) I would offer you some sour milk , but I know you 're on duty . Cherboucha , huh ? Ah , if it 86'ed the terrible twos and potty training , I 'd go for it . In fact , I 'd like to see my ex-husband in one-permanently . ( DOOR OPENS ) Dad ! Hello , sweetheart . Where 's your mother ? In the kitchen . Susan . Nemo . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) I put you and the children at such terrible risk . Not so terrible , George . Look around . I would die before I would let anyone hurt this family . George , we 're all right . But this man-this man who made the threats-he 's evil . He protects Overseers . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) George . We might be two people , but we share our souls . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) Matt and I have to leave . I know . MAN : ER Stat . He 's unconscious . What happened ? What happened ? WOMAN : I don 't know . OFFICER : The child is missing . ( SIREN WAILING ) What ? Bomb squad ? It says ... ( SIREN STOPS ) Fourth floor , first bomb threat . Better activate the elevator . Looks like we beat the truck . I didn 't get a call . What 's a good bomb threat without a victim ? We 've got five minutes for search and deactivation . Dang . Take the second car on the left . ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Matt ! Nice office . Wood paneling . If this exec isn 't online , I don 't know who is . SIKES : " Vesant . Assistant medical supervisor , Special Section . " " Status : Deceased . " When the ship crashed . ( SCOFFS ) Yeah . Positive identification . " Tivoli Adrian . Slave , ' L ' Section . Interrogated by CIA . Status : Released into general population 1993 . " SIKES : " Benson , Roger . CIA Covert operations , agent in charge . " " Newcomer investigation unit for Overseer prosecution . Status : Retired from agency 1993 . Reference OPSIL . " OPSIL ? ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) ( GRUNTS ) Our little bomb is due to go off any minute now . George , what about Dextra ? Maybe they haven 't had enough time to bury it all . Ah , that 's it . We 'll never find Benson and the child . E-mail , George . Check the e-mail . " BNA , Los Angeles to Washington . Requesting authorization for disposal of documentation referencing Tivoli . " Sent the day after she was murdered . Maybe they haven 't shredded ' em yet . Over here , George . " Tivoli . " ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Ah , just a small device . You probably didn 't even hear it . It went off ? Minor damage , a few file cabinets . GEORGE : " OPSIL . " It means " Operation Silence " and for good reason . Your government wanted first call on all Newcomer scientists , Overseers or not . Special Section or not . Overseers who should have gone to prison . They were given death certificates , new identities , backgrounds ... courtesy of Benson and the CIA . Then he drops out of sight for a while , comes back , quits the CIA ... starts up his own private management company ... and places Overseer scientists in important jobs . Well , why didn 't the CIA blow the whistle on him ? And admit they let these war criminals get away ? Not to mention the fact that some of them are probably still working for the government . It 's a hell of a conspiracy , George , but with those files , we can put ' em all away . Yes . But that won 't help the giant and the child . MAN : Agnes , bring your girls over here , please . MAN 2 : Can you turn those lights around so they 're facing the street not the house ? MAN 3 : Okay , can we get the dogs over here , please ? Cathy called . The child 's been kidnapped , George , and you and Sikes are in big trouble . Grazer 's on his way over here . You 've both been suspended . What about the house ? Nobody 's budging ' from here . Do you still have the flight logs on the , uh , Dextra chopper ? Sure . All right . Well , go back a year , um , anytime Tivoli was a passenger . Look for a place , probably , um , out-of-the-way ... work it against FAA Air traffic control tapes covering those flights . Zap , I need a location . All right . Come on back . Lookin ' good . Mr. Turner , generals , this tank will serve as our simulated target . What we 're going to demonstrate tonight is a multirange delivery system ... more powerful than a neutron ballistics missile . We have the patents and the technology to offer ... a wide range of advanced , first-strike or quick-response systems ... far superior to the current Minotaur and ' 80s programs . But we 're not here to sell slogans , just power . Activate the systems , please . WOMAN : Power up on quadrant four . I 'm very disappointed in Francisco . Him , his family-do it now . ( TECHNICIANS CHATTERING ) Do you think Tivoli kept the giant and the child a secret ? Yes . And when they got away , she was forced to tell . Tivoli must have been in a panic . And Benson had her killed to protect OPSIL . And the rest of the Overseer scientists he 's got under contract somewhere . But how many and where ? And what are they up to ? Any better ? No . Any word where the child might be ? Zapeda 's working on it . Uh , Cathy ? Cathy ... ( STAMMERS ) Not now , Matt . Please . I was wrong . Y-You gotta give me a second chance . This is not the time to discuss this . I know . I know ... but I had to say it before I chickened out . ( CELL PHONE RINGS ) ( BEEPS ) Cathy ... Yeah . Sikes . Yeah , go , Zap . SIKES : Tivoli used the Dextra chopper at least once a month . She cleared the local air force base each time . Landed once at Victorville for a repair . Okay . Western Mojave . Not much between Victorville and Twenty-nine Palms . They 'd have to have power . Legitimate or a tap-in ? Benson wouldn 't risk a tap . There are lines out of Barstow , um , running clear up to , uh , Granite Mountains . Go for it . PILOT : You got it . MAN : Yeah , check this one rolling ' up . Hold it right there . Hold it . Are we lost ? ( BARKING ) GRAZER : Zapeda , are you listening to this man ? We want Francisco and the giant . They 're not here . This is a private party . You 're gonna have to leave . Call off that dog ! Zapeda , you 're gonna be so fired it isn 't funny . Captain , I 'm here on my own time . We all are . Fine . I can get a search warrant . Get it . I 'll give you a tour . Oh , hey , listen . You wanna take a pizza order ? ( CHUCKLES ) Good dog . Good dog . ( GRUNTS ) I don 't see a thing . There . This is a surprise party . There 's the palace guard . SIKES : We just gotta get through this fence . GEORGE : Like that ? ( PISTOL COCKS ) Hey , wonder if I could take this for a little test drive ? ( TIRES SCREECH ) I love my job . He seems to know where he 's going . SIKES : He 's getting weaker . ( GRUNTS ) He 's got her . George ? George , what 's the matter ? This air lock . It can 't be . ( BEEPING ) ( MAN ON PHONE ) I 've got an unauthorized entry into Complex 9 . ( RHYTHMIC BEEPING ) I never thought I 'd see this again . What are you talking about ? This is a section of the slave ship . They told us none of this survived . ( MOANING ) ( BEEPING CONTINUES ) This is Special Section . ( LOUDER BEEPING ) Oh , no . ( STEADY BEEP ) ( STEADY BEEP CONTINUES ) Is she dead ? ( PHONE RINGS ) Now what ? Surround and search Complex 9 . ( HANDSET SETTLES IN CRADLE ) There 's not anything I can do for her . ( SIGHS ) ( ALARM BLARING ) Come on . Let 's get outta here . ( ALARM CONTINUES ) Matt , they 're coming . ( MEN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE ) George , quick , the other way ! Hurry ! ( PANEL BEEPING ) I don 't know where this leads . No time to be choosy , George . Go ! Keep moving . MAN : You there , halt ! Get that door open ! Hurry up ! ( BEEPING ) Come on ! The commander ship 's shuttle . I don 't know where this will take us . Still not fussy . ( MOTOR WHIRRING ) ( FEMALE SPEAKING TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( CONTINUES IN TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( TENCTONESE ON PA ) This is crazy , George . It 's like we 're still on the ship . Those awful battles . Space cannons-on Earth they 'd be a hundred times more dangerous than nuclear warheads . ( WHIRRING STOPS ) ( CONTINUES IN TENCTONESE ON PA ) It 's a firing order . Find a way out ! George , wait ! No , you don 't ! George , please ! Thousands of our people disappeared in Special Section . You must save those two . Come on ! Come on . ( BEEPING ) ( TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( BEEPING ) ( TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( CONTINUES IN TENCTONESE ) ( TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( CONTINUES IN TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( TENCTONESE ) Who is that ? Can you believe that ? What happened here ? What 's going on ? ( TENCTONESE COUNTING CONTINUES ) ( MACHINERY HISSING , WHINING ) ( MAN ON PA ) Systems report a malfunction . We have firing chamber disintegration . Everyone stay calm . Systems report irreversible chain reaction in weapons core . Evacuate immediately . ( REPEATS ) BENSON : There seems to be some sort of sabotaging . We 'll have to do this another day . Find out what went wrong . ( BEEPING ) BENSON : I said find out what went wrong ! Come back here ! ( MACHINERY POWERING DOWN ) You , come back ! I want this weapon saved ! ( MAN ON PA ) Systems report the core is fully corrupted . Two minutes to failure and uncontrolled implosion . Benson ! You . You did this . ( MAN ON PA ) Ninety seconds to failure . You can 't have two hearts . Not if I was human . ( MAN ON PA ) Seventy-five seconds to failure . ( MARTIAL ARTS YELLS ) ( FABRIC TEARING ) ( MAN ON PA ) Sixty seconds to failure . ( TENCTONESE ) ( CHOKING ) It 's too bad Vesant disobeyed orders and didn 't destroy her work . She was my best surgeon ... as you 've doubtless noticed ... by seeing my new face ! Chorboke ! Benson served his purpose . His likeness serves mine ! ( CHOKING ) ( GROANING ) ( MAN ON PA ) Thirty seconds to failure . CATHY : Matt , hurry ! George , you all right ? I 'm all right . Go . Run ! ( BENSON MOANING ) Come on , George ! ( MOANS LOUDER ) My neck ! I can 't move . ( MAN ON PA ) Twenty seconds to failure . Hurry up ! Let 's get out of here ! Go ! Come on . Hurry . ( MAN ON PA ) Ten , nine ... ( ALL CLAMORING ) Eight , seven , six ... five , four , three , two , one . No ! ( IMPLOSION STOPS ) It 's completely gone . There ... There 's nothin ' left standing . ( SPEAKING HALTINGLY IN TENCTONESE ) ( TENCTONESE ) CATHY : George . You can 't take them back . We can clear him of the Jones murder . But after we blow the whistle on OPSIL , who 's gonna decide what to do with them ? The same people that allowed this to happen in the first place . ( SPEAKING HALTINGLY IN TENCTONESE ) SIKES : There 's nothin ' out there but wilderness . ( SPEAKING HALTINGLY IN TENCTONESE ) ( SPEAKING HALTINGLY IN TENCTONESE ) ( TENCTONESE ) See ya . I don 't give them much of a chance . The spirits of those who perished ... they give them a chance . Debbie Degner and Philip Dirt . Debbie , there you go . Just great .

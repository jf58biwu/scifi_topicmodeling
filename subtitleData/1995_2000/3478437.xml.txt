 [ Morgan Narrating ] We 've been on this planet for 1 30 days , but somehow that seems like nothing ... compared to the 8 1 we 've been stuck in this dome . For some of us , the cabin fever was so bad , we 'd take any excuse to get away , even another scouting trip . The scouts were day-long boring forays to find food , fuel , and , most important , a safe way out of these never-ending mountains . We needed to find a route our vehicles could travel that took us to the westerly limits of this range , and it had to get us down below the snow line quickly enough ... so we couldn 't get pinned in by another storm . This is as good a place as any . You guys check out the other side of that ridge . I 'm gonna help Bess look for some food . What 's the point ? Every ridge we top , there 's another ridge right behind it . [ Morgan Narrating ] This was the ultimate irony of our situation - as much as the planet seemed to want us gone , it kept us trapped here with its own mountains , its own cold , and its own endless variety of perils . These shrubs are beginning to bud . I think spring 's almost here . I 'll believe it when I see it . Hey , John , take a look at these . Wow . It 's the first color I 've seen in three months that wasn 't a shade of gray . Think they 're edible ? Who cares ? They 're beautiful . Yeah . Those stalks might taste pretty good if you cooked them long enough , huh ? Just smell them , Danziger . They might help you forget your worries for a second or two . [ Sneezes , Spits ] Awful . ! Well , they 're not edible . Not by me anyway . Ugh . ! [ Morgan ] Hey , Danziger , Bess . Come here . ! [ Danziger ] Come on . [ Alonzo ] Danziger , get over here . What are you yellin ' about ? What do ya got ? Here . Check it out . If you look between those peaks , follow the shoulder down from the tree line . It runs down the dry wash to that valley on the far side of the range . Think our vehicles can make it through that far ? Been as far as that shoulder in the A.T.V. It 's rough , but it 's passable . I think you 've found it , boys . Yeah . I think you 've found a way out of here . Come on . Let 's get back , and tell the others . It looks like you 've been eating puff pastries . That 's not possible , is it ? Morgan , let go of me . So there are no ravines in the way ? No rivers ? Oh , the road gets bumpy every now and then , but for the most part , it 's pretty smooth sailin ' . I 'd say it 's our best chance to get out of here . Great.Just when I get the perimeter monitors up and working . So we 're really outta here ? There 's nothin ' stopping us . Not anymore . We 're headed back to civilization . Static loft mattresses and auto-tropic temp control ... and 5,000 channels of omnistimulation . Morgan , the colony ship is still two years away . Who cares ? Every step we take away from this place is another step closer to home . Well , I 'm gonna miss this place . [ Baines ] I 'm not . Hey , what 's the matter , Devon ? You 're not celebrating . Well , I think it 's great news . I 'm just not sure we 're ready to leave here yet . - Why not ? - Well , for starters , we don 't even know if winter 's over yet , and I would not wanna get stuck in another blizzard . Not to mention the fact that by leaving here , we would be leaving the blackout zone ... that 's shielded us from detection by Reilly . Well , we gotta deal with Reilly sooner or later . Might as well be sooner . And it has been getting a lot warmer lately . Uh , Danziger and Bess found spring flowers on the scout this morning . Spring flowers . All right , why don 't we start packing tomorrow , and if it continues to get warmer , we 'll ... leave . Agreed . [ Baines ] There you go , Devon . [ Exhales ] I don 't feel so good , Morgan . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . [ Electronic Voice ] Please halt . You are approaching the perimeter . Laser defense engaged . Please halt . You are approaching the perimeter . Laser defense engaged . Warning . Laser defense engaged . Laser defense engaged . Warning . Laser defense engaged . Ow ! Ow , my leg ! Perimeter intrusion . Perimeter intrusion . Step back from the perimeter . Bess ? - Step back from the perimeter . - Bess ? Perimeter intrusion . Perimeter intrusion . Hey , what are you doin ' out here ? Come on , look . Move back , okay ? You 're gonna set it off again . Okay . Honey , what 's wrong ? What happened ? What happened ? I don 't know . I told you that thing was dangerous ! I set the warning volume at top level . Listen to it . Bess , why don 't you - Now , move back before you set it off again . Well , turn it off ! . Bess , why didn 't you listen to the warning ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? What were you doing out here ? I - I don 't know , Morgan . You don 't know ? How can you not know ? I guess - I guess I was sleepwalking or something . Julia , check her leg . She got burned by the perimeter laser . Looks fine . Fine ? She 's got a six-inch gash here - The pant leg is burnt , but her leg looks fine . Well , you were screaming . I thought that it burned you . So did I. Well , you 're lucky . The laser could have done a lot of damage . Oh ! [ Grunts ] What 's wrong ? Oh , my stomach ! I can 't breathe ! I have a pain in my stomach . Ow - Well , I can block it , but it 'll make it very difficult to diagnose . Block it ! Block it ! Morgan - Hang on , Bess . Hang on . Julia , hurry , please . [ Device Hisses ] Okay , breathe in . Is that better ? [ Breathing Deeply ] Yeah . Yeah . Better ? Let 's get her back to the tent . Will you give me a hand , please ? You all right ? I could have been - This is strange . I wouldn 't have thought this was possible . Well , what is it ? Well , I 'm - I 'm just going by your hormone spectrum . It 's early to say , but I think you 're pregnant . Pregnant ? Y-You mean , pregnant pregnant ? I 'd like to do an abscan . But judging by your gonadotropin levels , I 'd say it 's pretty likely . Is that why my stomach 's been hurting ? Let 's do an abscan . At least for now , everything looks pretty normal . - Morgan , I thought you were taking your suppressors . - I-AskJulia . She was making them for me . Well , my synthesizing equipment isn 't all it could be , but - I mean , it 's possible that the compound was faulty . [ Chuckles ] Well , that 's fantastic . That 's unbelievable . That - That 's fantastic . Are you sure that this is a good idea , out here in the middle of nowhere ? Can we do this ? Well , it 's not ideal , but it 's perfectly safe . Earth pioneers delivered babies with a lot less technology than we have . Wow ! Congratulations . Julia , come quick ! There 's something wrong with my dad . Hurry . ! Come on . ! - [ Groaning ] - Hurry ! Something 's wrong , Doc . My gut 's killin ' me . Hold off on the pain block . I need to pinpoint the problem . Oh , God , make it quick . It 's okay , True . Julia 's gonna fix him . I 'm going to run a quick cell scan . What 's the matter , True ? It 's okay , baby . Pain 's goin 'away . Whoa . There 's something - He has the same H.C.G. levels that you have . What the hell is going on ? [ Julia ] I 've never seen that before . Does this mean I 'm not pregnant ? I don 't know . Have either of you encountered anything unusual lately ? An insect bite or a strange animal or plant ? Yeah . Yeah . Hey , hey , careful . It waited till we were right on top of it last time before it sprayed . It must be heat - or motion-sensitive . Ooh . Think that 's what made us sick ? I don 't know . Your stomach pain suggests you were poisoned in some way , but I didn 't detect anything foreign in your bloodstreams . And now that your symptoms are gone - Yeah ? So what does that mean ? I need to run some tests on this powder . I 'm sorry , sweetie . But maybe it 's for the best . I ... just don 't think it 's the right time for us . It 's not that , Morgan . I didn 't have enough time to get attached to the idea of having a baby . It 's just - I wanna get out of this place . But I thought you were sad about leaving . If we 're gonna go , I want to go . I want to take the north route and just get away from here . Well , the route doesn 't go north , but - Come on , you guys . Let 's go . Let 's get back . I want to scan this powder while it 's still viable . Preliminary bioscan revealed no familiar organic - [ Morgan Narrating ] Julia searched the powder for answers . She would search all night , knowing , as always , she labored with instruments and learning ... that belonged to another world . None of us knew that more answers were hidden ... in a few idle words from Bess about traveling north . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Julia found nothing that night . But the truth was close at hand , only waiting for us to see . What are you doin ' here ? I had to see it . Me too . John , look . What the hell is this stuff ? Hey . Julia , get this out of me ! What is it ? What are you doing ? I don 't know , but I want it out . ! It 's trying to get back into you . Let 's get you on respiration . It 's actually fighting to stay . I don 't want to turn up the suction . It might damage your lungs . - [ Grunts ] - John.John ! [ Gags , Coughs ] [ Julia ] You might have suffered some oxygen deprivation . Take it easy tonight . Keep this with you . Okay . You all right ? Yeah . It 's dying . [ Julia ] How do you know ? Can 't you feel it ? Bess , I need you to lie down here , please . I know it looks painful , but it 's not that bad , right , John ? Yeah . It 's great . Honey , what 's wrong ? Nothing 's wrong . I 'm fine . Bess , this organism does not belong in your body . Then how come I 've never felt healthier in my life , Julia ? I can 't explain that . I can explain that if you do not remove it now , it 's going to be harder to do it later . What if I don 't want to remove it ? I think you 'd make a mistake . Well , I guess I 'll have to be the judge of that . Thank you . [ Baines ] Either that stuff comes out ofher , or she leaves the camp . Since when are you making the rules , Baines ? Since my butt got put on the line . Does anyone remember what happened when that dead Terrian got into Danziger ? Yeah , I remember . You locked yourself in a trans-rover . What are you tryin ' to say ? [ Clamoring ] Stop it ! Whatever this stuff is , it 's got us beat if we can 't even talk about it without killing 'each other . Julia , what do you think we 're dealing with here ? I wish I could tell you . It 's unlike any toxin or parasite I 've ever seen , even on this planet . Then what is it like ? Well , that 's just it . Right now , what it resembles most is human blood , which is why my scanner missed it at first . You mean , it 's camouflaging itself ? So it sneaks into a body and takes it over . Nothing is taking over my wife 's body . All she did was say " No , thank you " to a vacuum tube down her throat . Morgan , it triggered pregnancy hormones in Bess 's bloodstream . And that may be just an atypical response in a human host , but it may be that the vapor is trying to make her feel protective of it . W-Well , wait a minute . What if - What if this thing is contagious ? Then you should hope that she gives it to you . Bess and Danziger both said they 've never felt better in their lives . John , is that true ? Well , not so much since Julia pulled it out of me , but for a while there , yeah . Look , I don 't care how good she feels . That stuff scares me . So what do you wanna do ? You wanna tie her down and stick a vacuum tube down her throat ... even though she doesn 't want it , even though she says she 's never felt better in her life ? That 's the idea , Morgan . Well , I 'm sorry , but it 's her body . Devon ? Morgan is absolutely right . We can 't force a medical procedure on anyone , especially if there 's no proven threat . It 's a beautiful day , isn 't it , Magus ? Yeah , right . I feel good today . Hey , guys . Let 's go , Gail . Bess , don 't pay any attention to them . They 're confused . It 's okay , Morgan . It doesn 't bother me . Ow , my hand ! What happened ? Oh , I don 't know . I crushed it on the crate , Morgan . Well , let me see this . Be careful . It hurts . I just want to make sure there 's no fibercomp in it . Ow ! Ah ! Ow ! Oh , my eye . Morgan , are you all right ? Morgan , let me see . What happened ? Look , just back off . Gimme a little room . Let me take a look at it , Morgan . Sit down . Morgan , honey ? Oh , you 've got a nasty burn . And a cut on your cornea . What happened ? It was the vapor . The vapor attacked him ? It came out of her mouth and went after him . Oh , Bess . Bess , now do you understand why everybody 's ... so concerned about whatever it is that 's inside of you ? It was just trying to protect me , Devon . By attacking your husband ? It didn 't attack you , honey , did it ? Bess . Bess , listen to me , please . This thing really must come out of you . No . No , no , if you take it out , it will die . Better it than one of us , don 't you think ? Don 't you ? You stay away from me , Walman ! I 'm warning you ! Look at her , Devon . It 's controlling her . [ Devon ] Walman , take it easy . I 'm sure Bess doesn 't want to hurt anybody . Do you , Bess ? [ Walman ] But how can we trust her , Devon ? She 's right , Walman . Just back off , okay ? Everyone , please . Just back off . You 're acting like a lynch mob here . She 's-She 's not a monster . This is Bess . She just needs a little time to think . Just needs a little ... understanding . Bess . Oh , God . Be okay , baby . Please . Please be okay . Be okay . You think you got it all ? [ Coughs ] Everything in her lungs . But what about the rest of her ? That won 't be as easy . She and John still both have it in their bloodstreams . How do we get it out ? Well , I 've synthesized an interferon variant forJohn ... that seems to be slowing the spread of the organism . How often does she take this ? Once every hour . But I have to warn you , if the organism resists this drug as much as it has everything else , it could be a little painful . [ Bess Inhales ] What happened ? I don 't feel good . Why am I tied up like this , Morgan ? Bess , we pulled the stuff out of you . Your eye . Oh , my God . Oh , that 's okay . Julia says it 's gonna heal up in about a week or so . I did that to you , didn 't I ? No , no , no . It wasn 't you . It was the stuff inside of you , Bess . Why are you still afraid of me , Morgan ? Morgan , please just leave me alone . No , Bess , I want to stay with you . I can 't look at you , Morgan . I can 't look at what I did to you . Oh , no , no . Look . It 's nothing , see ? Bess , I think that I 'm just going to loosen your hands a little bit . The stuff isn 't controlling you anymore . I should know my own wife . Bess , your hand is completely healed . Morgan , these straps are hurting me . - I know . I 'm sorry . But I can 't put the crew at risk . - I 'm not gonna hurt anyone ! All I wanna do is run . Run north and finish this . Bess , this stuff is still controlling you . Take me north , Morgan . Why ? What are you talking about ? What 's up north ? Take me there , and this will all be over with . I can 't . There 's another cold front moving in , and we 've already postponed plans to leave . It 's the only answer , Morgan ! No , it isn 't . Julia made this medication . It won 't work . ! Nothing will work but taking me there ! Now you 're starting to scare me , Bess . Morgan , help me . Now , you are the only hope I have . You 're the only one who will believe me . Help me , Morgan . ! I 'll do what I can . I 'm begging you , Morgan ! Help me ! Help me ! [ Straining ] You 're my husband . ! I need your help . ! Help me , Morgan . ! Help me . ! Help me . ! Help me . ! Morgan . ! Julia . ! Julia . ! The stuff is still controlling her . She wants me to take her north . What 's happening ? Is she losing her mind ? Did you give her the medication ? Well , I - Morgan , no matter how painful this is , no matter how much she resists , Look - this is crucial . Look - I know this sounds crazy , but ... what if we just did what she 's asking - pack her in a vehicle and take her north . She says it 's the only way to get the stuff out of her . Morgan , Bess can 't take trips . Her system is still crammed with this organism . No matter how strong she seems , she 's running on borrowed time . Borrowed time ? What are you talking about ? I 've been watching the parasite in her blood sample . Her liver is gonna fail if we don 't turn the tide on this thing . John gave us a head start by letting us remove the vapor when we did , but they need the interferon . If you can 't make her take it , I will . Morgan . Morgan . - She 's gone . - Gone ? It got quiet inside her tent , so I checked , and her bed is empty . Come on . It 's as though she literally ripped her hands free . Plus , she left her boots and her coat . Okay . What are you doing ? I 'm going after her . Morgan , you can 't go alone . I 'll stay in touch on gear . Do that . I 'm gonna follow you in the rail . Bess ? Bess ? If you can hear me , wait ! Bess , you need help ! I 've got your shoes and your coat ! Bess ! Lost her . I can 't see a thing with this stupid eye patch ! Julia , I 've lost her tracks . Just hold on , Morgan . She can 't be that far ahead . We may have to detour around some of this rough ground , but we 'll catch up to you . Wait a minute . I found her . I 'm going after her ! Bess ! Bess ! Wait , Bess ! I 'm coming ! [ Headset Beeps ] Devon , are you still on ? Yeah . Yeah , is she still headed north ? So far . If she stays on course , we 'll be able to overtake her . How is she gonna survive this cold without shoes or proper clothing ? I don 't know . It 's a miracle she 's made it this far . Do you have any idea what 's causing this , Julia ? The substance comes from a flower . It 's trying to hitch a ride somewhere . I 'm thinking that - How much do you know about plant reproductive biology ? My God . It 's brilliant . Plant pollen . Plant pollen ? On Earth , the male of many species produce a substance ... designed to be carried by flying insects to females far away . Are you saying this time , though , Bess is the carrier ? That 's why the organism protects her . It wants her to live long enough to reach its mate . It 's protecting her and killing her at the same time . Danziger too . It 's time for your medicine , Danziger . Oh , no . No , it 's too early . No , you must take it . No - Now , inhale . Inhale . Come on . Inhale one more time . Go . In . Okay , good . [ Coughs ] Oh , God ! I lost her tracks ! I found ' em , and I lost ' em again . And then I found ' em , and now they 're gone for good ! [ Julia On Headset ] Just hold on , Morgan . We 'll be right there . What 's wrong ? He lost her tracks . Well , tell him not to worry . She 's been goin ' due north all night . If he keeps going straight , he 'll find her . Did you hear that , Morgan ? Well , he better be right . Bess ! How can you do this to me ? How can you do this to me ? I found her ! I found her tracks ! [ Julia On Headset ] What ? What did you find ? Oh , my God . - There 's two sets of tracks . - Two sets ? There 's something else out here . Bess isn 't alone . Bess ? Bess ? These are your tracks I 'm following , aren 't they ? Bess ? Quick ! Come and see ! Did you find her ? Yes ! No ! Look . Look . These tracks split up here . They go off in different directions . I can 't tell who these tracks are , except one 's heavier than the other . Well , which set do we follow ? Let 's get in the rail . We 'll follow both . No , no ! There isn 't time ! Look , you two stay in the rail . Take these tracks to the left . They look better for a vehicle that way . Can I borrow these ? It 's not safe for you to be out this far without a vehicle . I know . I know . You 've been out here for 1 1 hours ! You need food and rest ! Morgan ! Wait . Come on . [ Julia Sighs ] That was a mistake . We should not have let Morgan go off by himself . Why ? We can cover twice as much ground this way . We don 't know what 's out there . What if he runs into something he can 't handle ? We never know what 's out there . What 's different now ? What 's different is we had a choice . We could have made a safe and sensible decision , but once again we decided to just wing it . You know , for someone who talks about learning from this planet , you haven 't learned much from it . What 's that supposed to mean ? This place is totally new to us , Julia . What 's the point of making plans when we have no idea what to expect ? - We don 't have to blunder forward without thinking . - Why not ? I mean , take a lesson from the Terrians . Let nature take its course . Stop the rail . Wait . You think he 's alive ? No . Doesn 't look like he 's breathing . He 's got the same stuff around his mouth . [ Julia ] You 're right . It 's pollen . I guess the pollen doesn 't protect them forever . What happened ? Nature took its course . [ Julia On Headset ] Morgan , we found who 's at the end of the tracks . - Not Bess ? - No , it 's a Grendler . It 's a dead Grendler . What killed him ? I 'm not sure , but it looks like the pollen . But at least you know you 're on the right track . I know . I think I see her up ahead . Bess ! Thank God you 're alive . Bess ! He 's got her . Hold onto her , Morgan . We 're coming . Bess . Bess , wait , stop . ! Bess . Morgan . Oh , Bess , stop just for a minute . No . We 're tired . You 're tired . No . I can 't . But look at your feet ! You need shoes ! You need a coat ! It will protect me , Morgan . I 'm sure whatever it is ... wants you to live long enough for you to bring it home . I 've never been stronger ! No offense , but you look like hell . Bess . Bess , it 's freezing out here . Damn it ! Come on , Bess . Bess . Look , another hostjust like you ... was found dead not too far from here , and I 'm sure he felt pretty strong too . Okay . Okay , quickly , Morgan . Okay . Okay . I 've got your jacket . And I 'll get your shoes , okay ? Okay . [ Yale ] Morgan , you 've got to stall her . Julia and Alonzo are coming as fast as they can . Stall her . Bess . Bess , I know that you feel very strongly about doing this . I know you feel very strongly about that . But , please , come back to camp . You need help . You need rest . I 'm not done yet , Morgan . Done doing what ? Do you even know what you 're doing out here ? I 'm helping something ... to live . Yes , you 're helping something , but it 's not you ! Morgan , all I know ... is I will find this place or I will die trying . Now , the only way to make it leave me is to take it to where it wants to go . Bess , are you sure ? Are you absolutely positive it 's the only way ? Yes , Morgan . [ Julia On Headset ] Morgan , you can 't listen to her . She may sound lucid , but it 's not Bess talking . Bess , wait ! Bess , how do I know for sure ? How can I be sure it 's not going to kill you ? Morgan , just trust me , okay ? Trust me . I want to . [ Julia ] Slow her down . She 's not going to survive much longer without treatment . What 's the matter , Morgan ? Come on . I miss my wife . I miss her so much . Bess , wait ! His gear signal originates here . I don 't see them . Maybe I 'm crazy , but I 've got to trust her . She 's my life . [ Heavy Breathing ] [ Groaning ] [ Screaming ] [ Breathing Heavily ] You know what I 'm feeling , Morgan ? Like taking a breather ? I 'm feeling like I 'm carrying a child . You 're not pregnant , Bess . Don 't let the stuff fool you . I know it 's not mine , but it 's still a life inside of me , Morgan . I hope so . This better not be for nothing . [ Headset Beeps ] [ Devon On Headset ] Julia , do you have an update ? Any sign of Bess and Morgan yet ? There 's still no sign of either of them . How are you tracking them without Morgan 's gear ? We 're just heading north , hoping they stay on course . Julia , I 've been running some tests on your pollen samples , and what I 've found may change our theories . [ Julia ] Like what ? Well , first of all , calling it pollen may be a misnomer . I mean , it has no genetic components , which makes it unlike any other reproductive agent I 've heard of . What 's it comprised of ? Mostly nonorganic compounds , which mimic the signaling behavior of organic protein and enzymes . What do you think it wants ? Well , I don 't know . But it 's a safe bet that whatever Bess finds at the other end of that journey ... will be something other than a pretty flower . I think Yale 's right . I 've been pickin ' somethin ' up , might have somethin ' to do with this . John , you 're up ? Are you feeling better ? Ah , I 've been havin some weird dreams lately . I think the pollen 's giving ' em to me . What kind of dreams ? I keep seein ' this high mesa that ends in a cliff . I know it sounds crazy , but this mesa ... looks like it 's breathing . Breathing ? Yeah . That 's not all . I think I know what happens when you get there . Bess , I don 't - I don 't think I can go any further . Ow ! [ Coughing ] Bess , don 't you ever need a rest ? Bess , do you know where you 're going ? Wait . Please . We need to stop . I 'm - I 'm trying to be supportive , you know , but - Bess , don 't go up there . Bess , get down here ! Bess , it 's too steep . Come down from there ! Bess ? Oh , my God ! Bess ! Bess . Bess . Are you all right , baby ? Bess . Bess , speak to me . Bess . Bess , speak to me . Bess . Bess , this isn 't healing . Bess , what 's happening ? Talk to me . Oh , why did I leave my gear ? Oh , Bess , what do I do now ? I could take you the rest of the way , but I don 't know where you 're going . I could take you back , but it 's too far to go . Honey . Honey , what do I do ? What do I do , Bess ? Am I nuts ? Am I crazy ? Bess , come on . We 're going . Come on , baby . I know where we 're going . There they are . Morgan ! Morgan . Morgan ! [ Julia ] He 's carrying her . Morgan . ! Come on ! Alonzo ! What ? If they 're headed towards the mesa , we can cut them off in the rail . Bess . Bess . Bess . Look . We made it . We 're here . Bess , we 're almost there . Danziger 's dream . They 're gonna jump in the hole . Alonzo , they 're gonna jump in the hole . ! How are we going to stop them ? Let nature take its course . The planet put that stuff in them , so let it take it out . No , they 're gonna die . Morgan ! Morgan ! Bess ! Morgan . Bess ! Don 't let them jump ! Wait ! Grab the rope , Julia ! Tie it to the rail ! Keep going . Come on . Hurry up ! [ Straining ] Come on ! Tie their feet together ! We 're almost there , Bess.Just - Come on . Hurry up ! Okay . All right , I got it . Okay . [ Alonzo ] Hold tight . And don 't let go . I see it , Morgan . Just a little further . Hey ! [ Strains ] [ Screams ] Bess ! Are you guys all right ? Morgan ? Bess ? They 're still conscious . Is that it ? [ Coughing ] It 's coming out of them . [ Coughing ] [ Groaning ] It 's working . Oh ! Morgan , what 's happening ? Bess , is that you ? [ Alonzo ] Are you guys all right ? Alonzo , get us the hell out of here ! [ Straining ] Get us out of here ! Hurry ! Come on . Ow ! Oh ! Are you all right ? Morgan . Come on . Let 's get outta here ! [ Julia ] It 's gonna blow . [ Morgan ] Did we do that ? I think you did . [ Bess ] What is it ? The air 's getting warmer . It 's so much more humid . What does this mean ? It 's spring . Bess , you made spring . [ Laughs ] We almost died in there , Morgan . I know . But I wasn 't afraid . Me neither . I guess the pollen took the fear away . No . No , it didn 't . You took the fear away . You didn 't give up on me for a second , Morgan . I couldn 't , Bess . I just couldn 't . [ Morgan Narrating ] So we sat there , watching spring pour from a chimney in the earth . We thought this planet had no use for us , but now we saw it did . We 'd completed a cycle of seasons that the planet itself could not , and in the process , won our freedom from the never-ending cold . The temperature rose for days and days . It was far from summer yet , but winter was definitely on the wane . The crew made preparations for an imminent departure , and all of us began to feel the thrill of expectation . Well , what 's next ? Come here . [ Morgan Narrating ] We 'd be living on the horizon once again , and this winter camp would be home only to memories of things feared , things overcome and things learned . Enough , we hoped , to help us make an impossiblejourney possible .

 Once upon a time , there was a guy with the improbable name of Fox Mulder . He started out life happily enough , as these things go . He had parents who loved him , a cute kid sister . He had a roof over his head , got all his flu shots , had all his fingers and toes and aside from being stuck with the name " Fox " which probably taught him how to fight ... or not he pretty much led a normal life . But the worst thing by far , the biggest kick in the slacks this kid Fox ever got , was what happened to his sister . One day , she just disappeared . Now , Fox buckled down and worked his butt off . Graduated top of his class at Oxford then top of his class at the FBI academy . None of that hard work made up for his sister , though . It was just a way of putting her out of his mind . Finally , the way I figure it , he went out of his mind and he 's been that way ever since . Fox Mulder pissed away a brilliant career , lost the respect of supervisors and friends and now lives his life shaking his fist at the sky and muttering about conspiracies to anyone who will listen . If you ask me , he 's one step away from pushing a baby carriage filled with tin cans down the street . But now , all that 's going to change . Tell them the truth , you lying son of a bitch ! He 's not me , Scully ! Scully ! Scully , he 's not me ! You hate me now , right ? Dana , I 'm sorry I narced on you to Kersh , but I ... I was scared you were going to lose your job . You did the right thing , Mulder . I did ? I 've been telling you for years you should play more by the book , haven 't I ? Hey , it 's the new me . Hey ... Hey , fellas , take ... What about these ? Come on , fellas . You ain 't going nowhere , mibby . You and me have had our asses officially disappeared . Looks like we 're up fudge creek . - Who are you ? - Call sign 's Maverick . Not like I 'm going to be hot-sticking it anytime soon . - Are you all right , Ma 'am ? - " Ma 'am ? " Kiss my ass , you desk monkey . No , no , no . Up , up ... Whew . I am Tiger Woods . So , what did Kersh say ? He said that I was willful , insubordinate and not a team player and the FBI didn 't need agents that weren 't team players . What a jerk . Then what ? - Two-week suspension without pay . - You 're not serious . Who does he think he is ? See you in two weeks . Dana ? You suppose a home-cooked meal might ease the pain a little ? Say , at my place 8 : 00 ? Think she likes me , Tiger . So there I am with this wet-behind-the-ears Rio flying back seat and I 'm thinking , ... " hell , man I 'm going to give this cherry the ride of his life . " So I 'm putting the spurs to her , you know ? And I 'm doing a little hassling with my wingman , Buzzsaw . - Now , Buzzsaw ... - Hey , Maverick would you mind ? - Hold up . Buzzsaw gets on my zero . He 's right on my zero . And when Buzzsaw gets on your zero ... - Maverick ... ? - ... he 's like a damn dog tick . - Maverick ? - You ain 't shaking that son of a gun . Hey , Grandma Top Gun , will you shut the hell up ? ! You 're my bitch now pencil-neck . General Wegman wants to see you . Son ... You got a set on you . I 'll say that much . You had us fooled . Why didn 't you tell us what you were doing from the start ? Meaning ? It 's the wrong one . You replaced the flight data recorder . This one 's from ... A scrapped F-111 , sir . It 's junk . You gave the FBI the wrong flight data recorder . Why ? Morry , if you were running a scam on the FBI why didn 't you let us in on it ? I didn 't know if I could trust you . We have a security leak , gentlemen , and for all I knew it was one of you . That 's why I decided I should approach Agent Scully alone to find out who her contact is . Unfortunately , her partner Agent Mulder screwed everything up . So why didn 't you tell us all this afterward ? I knew that you wouldn 't believe it until you figured it out for yourself . So the real flight data recorder is safe ? - Oh , yeah . Absolutely . - And you will bring it back ? Of course . By God , you do got a set on you . I wish I could say the same about some of your colleagues . About those who proffer rumor and innuendo those who make dangerous accusations . - Sir , Morris 's behavior seemed to ... - You can explain yourself to the review panel in Washington . I 've already wired them recommending censure for your actions . You 're lucky I didn 't throw you in the stockade . A little mood lighting for the bedroom . No bedroom . This guy hasn 't been laid in ten years . Hey , Chris . Hey , I like the , uh ... - The , uh ... The nose ... - Ouch ! As if . Terry . Buddy . Hey , Terence . Sorry . How 's it going ? Mom says she 's taking out a restraining order on you . - What are you doing back ? - Joanne ... Your stuff is all outside . Take it and get out . Joanne , listen to me . There 's something I got to tell you . I 've heard enough from you for one lifetime , Morris . Go tell it to that tramp of yours , that Scully , whatshername . Dana Scully - Special Agent Dana Scully . - Special Tramp Dana Scully . - She 's my partner , Joanne . - I 'm supposed to be your partner . - My name is not Morris Fletcher . It 's Fox Mulder . Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI . Dana Scully is my FBI partner . I am not your husband , we are not married , we are complete strangers and I have a whole other life that I 'm desperately trying to get back to . You know , Morris , most men when they have a mid-life crisis they go out and buy themselves a sports car . They don 't run around calling themselves Fox . I want you to look out the window . Will you just look out the window with me for a second ? See that car down there ? See the two men in it ? They 're surveilling me . They 're spying on me . I don 't know if your husband ever told you this but he has a very dangerous job and those two men in that car , like you , think that I 'm him only they don 't trust me . So , one false move and I 'm history . Which means that your husband will also be history because I won 't be able to get back and set things the way they 're supposed to be . Do you understand what I 'm saying to you ? Morris , if you don 't like the man you 've become I don 't blame you one bit . But this flight from reality isn 't the answer . Accept who you are . However repulsive that may be . Perfect timing . Welcome . Wow . Mulder . You like , huh ? Yeah , I thought it was time I stopped living like a frat boy . Come on and see the rest of the place . Over there . - I didn 't even know you had a bedroom . - Oh , yeah . Yeah , got to have someplace to lounge around and read the Sunday New York times , you know . Uh , no , that 's okay . Thanks . Seriously , just check it out . Seriously . Mulder ... Maybe I like to read the New York Times backwards . Do you hate it ? No , I don 't hate it . Well , all right then . Uh , don 't go away . Let 's get it on ... Let 's get it on ... Let 's get it on ... Let 's get it on . Tonight is the night ... Do you know what would really be fun ? What ? Oh , yeah . - Me first ? - You first . First time . Now what ? - You 're not Mulder . - What ? - Baby ... - " Baby " me and you 'll be peeing through a catheter . Your name is Morris Fletcher . It was Mulder who was arrested in the desert . He was telling the truth about you . Now , how do we get things back to normal ? How should I know ? I wouldn 't do it even if I could . You saw my wife . Do you think I want to go back to that ? Two kids who 'd probably kill me in my sleep for the insurance money . A $ 400,000 mortgage on a house that just appraised at $ 226,000 . And my job ... Yee-gods . You think being a man in black is all voodoo mind control ? - I can see the paperwork . - Are you through ? As far as I 'm concerned this thing is a gift from heaven . Besides , no one is ever going to believe you so you might as well just get used to me being here . Or I just shoot you ... Baby . I 'm telling you , I have no idea how to change things back . What about Mulder 's source ? The man he was supposed to meet in the desert ? What about him ? Do you know how to get in touch with him ? I don 't know anything about that . Sorry . You 're out of luck . Hello , hello . I 'm very busy entertaining a * special * guest . Leave a message and I 'll get back to you . Agent Mulder , I 'm trying you one last time . Are you or are you not interested in the classified information I have to give you ? Please pick up the phone if you 're there . - Mulder . - Agent Mulder , listen very carefully . Well , I guess we 've given the neighbors enough to talk about . For God 's sake , Morris at first you couldn 't wait to get away from me and now you won 't leave the house . Where can we go ? - What do you mean ? - You 're right . We should get out of the house . Go someplace with a lot of people . Someplace with a lot of people ? - In Rachel , Nevada ? - What do you say ? All right , let 's run through this one more time . I 'll go in there alone , just like you told me to . He 'll be wearing a blue Buffalo Bills cap . And ? And if I try and slip out the back door da-da-da-dee-dee-dee . Get going . Can 't we start over ? You know , do that thing with the handcuffs ? Probably not your scene . I have waited for what seems ... Like a whole light-year ... Just to see your face ... Once again , my dear ... Shiny brown-eyed moonlight , Sunlight , starlight ... With big dark eyes that send me out of sight ... Now I 'm staring at the stars ... - Are you expecting someone ? - No , I 'm not expecting someone . Because if you 're here expecting someone and not to buy me a drink , you should tell me now so I can divorce you and take the house . Joanne , have another white wine . You 're the guy ? ! Sit down . Well , I 'll be damned . Whoa , ooh , that beer , it went right through me . I got to ... I 'll be right back . - You sabotaged a UFO ? - Keep your voice down . I didn 't intend for it to crash , Agent Mulder . I just meant to disable the stealth module so you could see it . Scully . Mulder ? Is that really you ? What are you doing here ? I 'm trying to figure out a way to help you . - What , are you , like , disgruntled ? - You make me sound like some postal clerk . What you came for is on the floor by your feet . Morris ? In my memory you are moonlight , starlight ... With big dark eyes that send me out of sight ... Now I 'm staring at the stars ... Wondering where you are ... Wondering if I 'll ever see your face again ... Now I 'm staring at the stars ... Wondering where you are ... Joanne ? Hey , how 's it going ? - Listen , have you seen Morry ? - You bet I 've seen him . Hey , hey , whoa , guys . Guys . - What the hell was that , Morry ? - I guess I make a lousy husband . I 'll talk to her . So you 're the guy that wants my life . I assume that includes all the ass-kickings . - Oh , no ... You don 't want to do this . - Yeah , I do . - Jeff 's outside . - So what ? If he sees us together , we 're both dead . Especially when he sees this . You take that to Scully right now . You must have some sort of waxy buildup . I said Jeff 's here . No way am I going out there until he leaves . You sneak it past him . You 're his buddy . His buddy ? He doesn 't trust me as far as he can throw me . You saw to that . Oh , geez . Hey . Hey . ... as long as the sun would shine ... You would love me , love me ... And I hope you 'll love the sunshine ... One more time ... - Jeff . - General Wegman . You men , come with me . Sir ... What are we , uh ... ? There . Detain that man . Morris ... Stop . Hey , guys . - What 's in the bag , Morris ? - It 's , uh ... Beer . - You sure it 's not a flight data recorder ? - No , it 's beer . Suckers . Mmm . More huevos rancheros . Mas huevos rancheros . Por favor . Open up . Mulder ... If I 'd known you were coming I would have made more salsa . - We need your help right now . - Who crashed ? Who , what , why . I need to know everything that 's on that data recorder . It 's similar in size and shape to the FDRs on the SR-71 . Well , that 's definitely not standard issue . - Where did you get this ? - Groom Lake . Outside Area 51 . - Dreamland . - The Aurora spy plane . - What 's that ? - Black world . Top , top secret . A skunkworks special . Aurora is a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft fueled with slush-hydrogen . Or methylcyclohexane . What 's with him ? You guys like the name ? I 'm going to go with either " Aurora " or " Borealis . " - What the hell 's he talking about ? - Mulder ... He 's not Mulder . We think the crash of this particular aircraft , whatever it was , resulted in a , uh ... My name is Morris Fletcher . I work inside Area 51 . I assumed Mulder 's identity through a warp in the space-time continuum . Trust me , little man , I ain 't him . Oh , I love you guys . I really do . I mean , you 're the " Lone Gunmen , " aren 't you ? You guys are my heroes . I mean , look at this crap you print . - We uncover the truth . - Oh , the truth . Well , see that 's what 's so great about you monkeys . Not only do you believe this horse pucky that we create you broadcast it as well . I mean , look at this . There is no Saddam Hussein . This guy 's name is John Gillnitz . We found him doing dinner theater in Tulsa . Did a mean King and I. Plays good ethnics . You 're trying to say that Saddam Hussein 's a government plant ? I 'm saying I invented the guy . We set him up in ' 79 . He rattles his saber whenever we need a good distraction . Ah ... If you boys only knew how many of your stories I dreamed up while sitting on the pot . - What stories ? - Oh , I 'm sorry , Melvin , that 's classified . The name 's Frohike , you punk ass . What the hell did you do with Mulder ? Shut up , all of you . If you guys want Mulder back , get me these results . - Who is it ? - Morris Fletcher . Come in . We shouldn 't be seen together . Not after last night . Fletcher ... Mulder ... Whoever you are . I 'm hoping this 'll be our last meeting . Agent Scully 's flying back with the analysis of that flight data recorder . It 'll be too late to save me . I know . The real Morris Fletcher knows you 're the leak . Once you get back , if you get back , he 'll have me arrested . Disappeared . Even if he doesn 't his colleagues will figure out soon enough I sabotaged that craft . - Why 'd you do it ? - I didn 't mean for it to crash . I just wanted you to see it . Well , why ? There comes a time when you ... look back instead of forward ... See the sum of your life . My entire career has been spent hiding the truth from the American people destroying , in a way , that which was most precious to me . What is the truth ? You mean ... You don 't know ? - I don 't know what ? - The truth , what * is * going on here at Area 51 ? What are these black-budget projects ? We just fly these birds . They don 't tell us what makes them go . They engineer them all up in Utah . Well , if you don 't know , why 'd you call me ? Well , I ... I 've seen your file . You 've chased flying saucers for years . Do aliens really exist , Agent Mulder ? Something 's coming up . Got it . - What is it ? - We broke the encryption . This baby records the telemetry of 28 systems including airspeed , fuselage torque and delta-v . Yeah , all the usual readouts , but , uh ... What are these ? Tachyon flux ... Gravitational displacement . " Aurora , " my ass . What have you guys been flying out there ? All right , I want you guys to analyze that data . - Morris ... - This is one of mine . - Get your butt in gear . - You 're going to miss me when I 'm gone . - Fat chance , laughing boy . - Back off , Sneezy . Enough . Call me when you guys have some answers . Ah , far out . - The black mailbox . - Dude , that 's a white mailbox . No , they painted it white to hide it . This is the black mailbox . The best place to see Freedom Mountain and the UFOs over Dreamland , man . I know a guy who saw five in one night . He said they danced in the sky . You guys hear that ? What the hell ? Cool . Did you guys see that ? You don 't look too happy . Don 't tell me I 'm going to have to put two kids through school . That is you in there , Mulder , isn 't it ? I , uh ... I just got off the phone with Frohike . They were able to download and analyze the crash data and , yes , there was an anomalous event that night . And how do I get back ? Well , that 's just it . It 's all about random moments in time ... About a series of variables approaching an event horizon . And even if we ... could recreate that moment if we could sabotage another craft ... Mulder , if we were ... If we were off ... If the event were off by even one millisecond ... I might wind up with my head in a rock . Something like that , yeah . What about him ? I mean , me . Whatever . Whoever he is . Agent Mulder has become AD Kersh 's new golden boy . He 's been tasked with returning the flight data recorder that he and I stole . The son of a bitch confesses to Kersh even more than I do to my priest . - I 'm just tagging along for the ride . - What do you mean , " just tagging along " ? I 'm out of the Bureau . I 've been censured and relieved of my position . No . You can explain it to them like you explained it to me . You have the data . You can make them understand . You can get your job back . I 'd kiss you if you weren 't so damn ugly . Take a picture , it 'll last longer . If I ... shoot him is that murder or suicide ? Neither , if I do it first . Hey , Scully ... Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! You got to help me ! You got to help me ! Open the window ! Please , open your window ! I need to talk to you ! Please , I need somebody to help me . It 's this thing ... It was like , like , like a wave ... Like all squiggly and everything ... And ... And their faces , they , they stuck together ! And , and , and her arm ... it was coming through his chest ! Sam , man , where you been ? Who 's the dude ? I swear , man ... They were messed up . I believe you . So the motel guy wants cash . Won 't take credit card , do you believe that ? So then it hits me , I flash him my badge : " Fox Mulder , FBI . " I tell him we 're investigating crappy motels in the Southwest . He 'd better watch his behind . So guess what ? The guy gives me the room for free and he throws in a six-pack of brews to boot . I love this job ! Listen , Dana , after we return this flight recorder what do you say I have a word with the big man , see if I can get you your job back ? We could have lots of fun together once you got to know me . You know that , Danes ? I 've still got my gun . All right , already . Wait a second , hold on . Back up . - What is it ? - Back up . Can I help you , ma 'am ? I don 't understand . This ... this place was burnt to the ground . I don 't think so . Yeah ... This place , two nights ago . I think I 'd remember that . What 's going on ? - What are you doing here ? - I need to talk to you . Something 's happened . Morris ! Don 't forget your stupid chair ! You and it should be very happy together ! Terence , get back inside . - You got a lot of gall coming back here , sister . - Joanne , I told you ... I 'm not your husband . - This man is . - You come here to watch my family fall apart ? You getting some kind of big kick out of that ? I have to talk to you alone . Homewrecker ! - Careful . You 're going to bust a lung . - Leave me alone . Joanne ... What he said about me being your husband it 's true . Get the hell off my porch . We got married on June 13 , 1978 . It rained that day . You got mad at me at the reception because I said couldn 't see the cake behind your fat ass . Remember our first apartment ... that dump in Pentagon City ? You 'd turn the air conditioner on and the lights would go out ? Or when you were pregnant how I 'd tickle your kneecaps to make you laugh ? Remember ? Remember the night Chrissy was born ? When I held her in my arms all red-faced and screaming ? That was the only time I ever saw you cry . Oh , my God ... Morris ? Is that you ? - Come on , Morris . Let 's go . - What do you mean , go ? Where are you taking him ? Mrs. Fletcher , we have reason to believe that whatever event caused this ... - ... to happen may be in the process of reversing . - We got to get back to that highway , back to the exact spot where this all began . It may be our only chance . - Sorry , Morris . A traitor 's a traitor . - This isn 't what it looks like . Got it ! Sir . - What are you doing ? - I 'm cleaning up a mess . - What are you talking about ? - About an hour ago I put Captain McDonough and Mrs. Chee back where they belong . Now it 's their turn . The warp that started this is snapping back like a rubber band . Only we have to be in its path when it happens . Why are you doing this ? Till now , I had a spotless career record . I want that back . So this is time snapping back ? It 'll be like the last few days never happened . You won 't remember any of this . Oh . Well , in that case , Dana ... It 's been real . Come on , Mulder . Let 's go . - Mulder . - Mulder , it 's me . I just wanted to let you know that we slipped under Kersh 's radar . Our little field trip to Nevada went unnoticed . Oh , yeah ? Mulder , I 'm sorry that your confidential source didn 't pan out . Well , I guess you were right , Scully . Just another crackpot who watches too much Star Trek . - Good night . - Hey , Scully ? I , uh , know it 's not your normal life , but ... Thanks for coming out there with me . You 're welcome .

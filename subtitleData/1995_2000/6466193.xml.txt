 Let 's do it ! Hey , how you doing ? Quite a little party . What do you know ? We got reports of at least a dozen shots fired . Door looks like it 's been jimmied , but the alarm wasn 't tripped . - Did you see anybody come out ? - Not a soul . Whoever it is , they 're still in there . Move . Move . Move . Lieutenant , over here . Looks like someone got hit . So where 'd he go ? Stay low , but keep looking . Davis . Gonzalez . Yeah ? Easy , buddy . - Take it easy . - They 're here . - You hurt ? - They 're here . Who 's here ? They 're here . They 're here . They 're here . Talk to us . Who 's here ? Come on . Stop ! Police ! Freeze ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Turn around slowly ! We didn 't do it . Do what ? Whatever . Face down on the floor . Now ! Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! All right , cuff ' em . Spread ' em ! Oh , man . They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! They 're here ! We 're screwed . Thank you so much for getting me involved in this , Doohickey . " Frohike , " you hippie jerk . Doohickey . You know , with that long blonde hair , you 'll be the first one in here that gets traded for cigarettes . I 'm going to be laughing my ass off . Oh , yeah ? You want to cha-cha ? Anytime , anyplace . Both of you relax . Shut up , you narc . It 's your fault we 're here . You in the suit . You first . Detective Munch , Baltimore Homicide . Did they find her ? And a good evening to you . Sorry . No sign of your mystery lady . She is real . The FBI agent saw her . Yeah , well , Special Agent ... Mulder is currently being held in five-point restraints and jabbering like a monkey . The FBI 's not talking either . So what I 'm looking at here is a warehouse break-in with nothing stolen , a shoot-out but no guns , lots of blood but no bodies , and an FBI agent who likes to take off all his clothes and talk about space aliens . Fill me in , from the top . Start with your name and birth date . John Fitzgerald Byers , 11-22-63 . Seriously . I was named after JFK . Before the assassination , my parents were going to call me " Bertram . " Lucky you . Occupation ? I work for the government . For the moment . And what do you do for the government , for the moment ? I 'm a public affairs officer for the Federal Communications Commission . It was in that capacity that I was attending the computer and electronic show at the Baltimore Convention Center . It was where this whole thing started , just this morning . We at the FCC enjoy forging positive ties with the American public . It 's our way of saying " communication " is just another word for " sharing . " Hi , guys . You like a button ? Up yours , narc . Of course , some people don 't see it like that . At any rate , that was where I first saw her . Would you like a but-button ? I ... I 'm still not sure why I did what I did next . It was so unlike me . There was just something about her . Ken , I 'm going to take a short break , okay ? Whatever . Hello , pretty lady . Picture this : crystal-clear television , 33 channels ' worth , with no monthly cable bill . Excuse me ? Now , I know what you 're thinking . " Melvin , are you out of your mind ? No cable bill ? " But that 's what I 'm saying . And I 'm talking premium channels here , too . You got your HBO , you got your Cinemax , you got your Showtime- - all courtesy of this modestly priced marvel designed and built by the Frohike Electronics Corporation . There 's a name that inspires consumer confidence . Shut up , punk . Where were we ? Hey , lady , if you want to watch Matlock with Andy Griffith all blue and squiggly , go right ahead and buy from this guy . If you want quality bootleg cable , you talk to me . If you want a converter that 'll short out and burn your house down , definitely talk to this guy . That was a one-time fluke . I heatsink every breadboard . Yeah ? What about co-ax loss ? Do you use the RG6 / U or the 52-ohm RG-8 ? Trick question . It 's a 9913 . Big man . Ah-narc ! - Oh ! - Oh ! God . Sorry . I 'm sorry . She 's very cute . Yes . She is . Thank you . Wait . Um ... uh ... You just look like you could use some help . So my daughter turned three years old last week . Last Tuesday was her birthday . I hope he remembered that . Her ... her father took her from you ? My former boyfriend . He kidnapped her . It 's a long story . Basically , I got involved with a man who turned out to be a complete psychotic . Yeah ? We were only together a few months . I was attracted to him because he was dark and mysterious , and then he just kept getting darker and more mysterious . I got pregnant , and he left . And then , he suddenly came back and took her about six months ago . That 's terrible . Did you call the police ? Of course . The police and then private investigators . They were surprisingly unhelpful . That 's unbelievable . Yeah , well ... at least I managed to get a couple of leads . I was told he 's in the Baltimore area . So here I am . Well , that 's a start . Yeah . Except he now knows that I 'm looking for him . And the closer I get , the more dangerous he becomes . Are you ... worried he might harm your daughter ? Let 's just say I want to find her , not him . This is the only other lead I 've got . That 's why I 'm here today . This has something to do with computers ... doesn 't it ? The Internet ? Actually , the Arpanet . It 's a government network created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . You can access it through the Internet though . Somehow , this means something to my ex-boyfriend . I was hoping it might be a means of finding my daughter . If you want ... I can go online ... try and find out for you . Would you ? That ... I would really , really appreciate that . Uh , by the way , my name 's John . Holly . It 's nice to meet you . Holly . Just like the sugar . Yeah . Just like the sugar . That 's funny . Ken , could you maybe go take a short break ? Whatever . Okay . Let 's see here . So , your ex-boyfriend is into computers ? I don 't really know . I knew very little about him , except that he 's psychotic . Hmm . Somehow , this kicked us into the Defense Data Network . I 'm sorry . I think this is the end of the line . Isn 't this something you could , uh ... I mean , how do you say it ? Hack into ? Hack into ? No . I mean , technically , yes , I probably could , but this belongs to the Department of Defense . This is a secured site . I mean , I work for the FCC . This is the kind of thing we 're trying to stop . Thank you , John . I appreciate your time . Wait . You didn 't see this . What did you do ? Oh , it 's a government system . I know a couple of loginout tricks with the VMS version five ... Never mind . Can you look up " Susanne Modeski " ? That 's my daughter . I 'll try . There 's just no way of telling . Huh . What is that ? It 's an encrypted file . Why would your three-year-old have an encrypted file in a secret Defense Department database ? Can you decode it ? I 'd need some help . Can you print it out for me ? My God . Hide . What ? My ex-boyfriend is out there . The psychotic ? He must have tracked me here . He 's looking for me . Damn it . There he is . You look like a gentleman who 'd appreciate 33 channels of crystal-clear television . No thanks , handsome . Ah , a man of distinction . Punk ass . It was at this point we enlisted the help of one Melvin Frohike ... computer hacker . Well , hello , pretty lady . Oh , yeah . What 's with the narc ? We proceeded to tell him the entire story . I hoped he could assist me in deciphering the encrypted file . It was at this point , however , that Mr. Frohike raised an interesting question . I don 't understand . Why don 't you just kick this guy 's ass ? What ? No . I just want these pages decoded . Can you do that ? Sure , baby . My kung fu is the best . But it could take hours . I say , cut to the chase . If pretty boy out there can tell us where your daughter is , we just need to go beat it out of him . Bad idea . He 's very dangerous . Lady , I 'm dangerous . All right . So we 'll just follow him . For all we know , he 's got the girl here somewhere . - Holly , it makes sense . - No ! Just stay away from him . We 'll stay back a ways . Just wait for us here . Come on , FCC . Uh ... What 's he doing ? Talking to somebody . This dude doesn 't look so tough . Act casual . Alien invaders are among us . Detect their presence with high-tech monitoring trucks ... Oh ... sorry . ... before they detect you . They 're here . He 's moving . Alien invaders are among us . Detect their presence with high-tech monitoring ... What 's up , fellas ? You looking for somebody ? Just , um ... the bathroom . I don 't think it 's down here . Hey , you with the FCC ? What 's it to you ? I think we share the same credit union . Special Agent Fox Mulder . I 'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . I was hoping maybe you could help me . I 'm looking for a girl . I was wondering if you 'd seen her . This is her here . Have you seen her ? Sorry . Hmm ? What did she do ? What 's it to you ? Thanks , guys , all right ? Yeah . Mulder . Oh , hey , Reggie . What 's up ? What the hell was that all about ? Her ex-boyfriend is with the FBI ? Where 'd she go ? Okay , stand back , folks . Excuse us here . Let us through . Ken ? You don 't understand . All I did was play Dig Dug . I didn 't hack into anybody 's computer . - Excuse us , please . - Seriously , guys , I 've got , like , a circulatory problem . I have a tendency to fall down a lot . Wait . It was me . What are you doing ? I hacked into their computer . So you want to turn yourself in ? Are you crazy ? A hacker never turns himself in . I am not a hacker . Listen , we got FBI agents running around , military police . Whatever the hell is going on around here , it 's big , and your lady friend is somehow at the center of it all . She needs my help . How can we learn what 's going on ? The FBI are looking for her . Hack into the FBI mainframe . I know just the guy who can do it . You 're talking about a premeditated crime against the United States Government . Hey , your second one today . Welcome to the dark side . Okay , ladies , who 's down for 50 ? 50 bucks . Anyone ? 50 bucks . Ah , man . My diaper-wearing granny would bet 50 . Come on . There 's no game here . All right . 50 . Elron the Druid bets 50 . Cash only , Elron . I don 't take no personal checks from the bank of Middle Earth . Come on , natural 20 . Daddy needs a new sword of wounding . What 's the big idea bringing the narc in here ? Me and the narc have a proposition for you . What proposition ? The coolest hack in the world . Lord Manhammer ? Say it . Say it . Your kung fu is the best . Here . Make yourself useful . What does this do ? Besides overheat and burn the hotel down ? It 's a loop line shunt . Anyone who tries to trace us will get bounced around by CP 's call-forwarding software . My personal invention . Oh , God . I 'm going to get fired . I 'm going to go to jail . I deserve to go to jail . Shut up already . What do you need me to do ? Just watch and learn . Bingo . Government hack is a snap . Last week , I got into the Maryland DMV . Changed my endorsement so I could handicap park . I got tinnitus . What now ? Look up the FBI agent . What 'd he say his name was ? Mulder . That your boy ? Fox William Mulder , born 10 / 13 / 61 . Degree in psychology from Oxford University . Top of his class at Quantico . Commendations out the yin-yang . Currently attached to the Violent Crimes Unit . Single . There 's nothing in here about him being a psycho or having a daughter . Try , under active cases , " Holly Modeski . " Nada . No case file . Try the daughter , " Susanne Modeski . " She 's Susanne Modeski ? " Employee at the Army Advanced Weapon Facility " at White Stone , New Mexico . " Whitecorps . Oh , man , look at this . Says here she blew up one of their labs , killed four people , including the MP who tried to stop her at the gate . " Subject Modeski is considered unstable and delusional . " Intellectually brilliant , yet prone to confabulation and fits of violent behavior . " " Psychotic and profoundly paranoid . " " Armed and extremely dangerous . " Do not approach . Call immediately for backup . " Oh ... oh , no . You 've been reading about me . My name is Susanne Modeski ... not Holly . I 'm ... I was an organic chemist for the Advanced Weapons Facility . But I never blew up any lab , and I certainly never killed anybody . All I did was try to quit . I don 't have a job you just quit . What about your daughter ? I don 't have one . I 'm sorry . The photo ? Came with the wallet . You wouldn 't have believed the truth , obviously , and I desperately needed your help . For what , exactly ? To get this . I still need it deciphered . This has in it everything I need to expose the United States Government 's plot against its own people- - one I unwittingly helped to forward by developing the ergotamine-histamine gas . Ergotamine-hist ... ? " E.H. " for short . It 's an aerosolized gas which , in small doses , causes anxiety and paranoia in its subject . Paranoia ? Gotcha . Secret forces within the government plan to test this gas on the American people right here in Baltimore . I am not making this up . Don 't you get it ? Nobody is safe . Look what they did to JFK . What did they do to JFK ? Dallas ? 1963 ? Hello ? They want to control every aspect of our lives , from the cradle to the grave . They practically do already . Hotel Bible . Who do you think put this here ? The government ? One in every hotel room in America . It 's the perfect vessel for electronic surveillance . No one ever questions its presence . Now , I 'm sorry . You 're telling me that the U.S. Government , the same government that gave us Amtrak ... Not to mention the Susan B. Anthony dollar . ... is behind some of the darkest most far-reaching conspiracies on the planet ? That 's just crazy ! I-I mean , like , this guy works for the government . I 'll prove it to you . Just help me decipher this . What do you say , guys ? Of course , at that point , we didn 't feel like we had much choice . Get it off me . Langly , what 's taking so long ? It should be up any second . Oh , yeah . Here we go . Far out . Thank God for supercomputers . " The surprise defection of Dr. Susanne Modeski " is a blow to the program , though not a fatal one . " The timetable remains unchanged . " The first E.B.O. will occur " in the Baltimore - Washington corridor within one week 's time . " What 's an E.B.O. ? Engineered Biological Operation- - toxic organic agents used on humans . " Security risks are being attenuated . " Dr. Modeski 's team has been processed and plausible denial constructed . " Which is another way of saying that they 've murdered my research associates and placed the blame on me . Now do you understand ? Wait . Here it is . " E.H. product is presently warehoused " at 204 Fells Point Road , lot number A-9000 , awaiting E.B.O. " This is it . " Subject Modeski currently monitored around the clock . " Covert electronics installed per Dr. Michael Kilbourne , 11-6-88 . " Who 's Dr. Michael Kilbourne ? My dentist . Excuse me . What do you think ? That thing about her dentist ... Dr. Modeski ? Get in here ! My God ! What did you do ? Look at it . Look at it ! Am I seeing what I think I 'm seeing ? What 's the address of that warehouse ? Where 's the tooth ? We flushed it . We were afraid it would give away our location . So ... we broke into the warehouse . Here it is ! A-9000 , right ? Asthma medicine ? This is how they plan on distributing the gas- - in asthma inhalers . This is their random test . Now we 've got proof . Stay where you are ! I 'm a federal agent ! Susanne Modeski , you are under arrest for the murders of four people at Whitestone Army Base . She didn 't do it . She 's innocent . Yeah . You three are under arrest also . Ma 'am , stay where you are . Just listen ! There 's more going on here than meets the eye . You three get on the ground now ! Ma 'am , stop moving . I 'm not going to ask you again . Dr. Modeski , please come with us . Federal agent . Identify yourself . Ma 'am , come with us . Step forward and identify yourselves now ! Man . Susanne ? ! Sanitize it . Good . Come on . Whoa , whoa , whoa . They 're here . I 'm alive . I 'm alive ! Who are you people ? Whoa ! What authority do you have to do this ? Shut up , Byers . Bag him ? No one touches this man . Excuse me . Byers . Sir . Why are you doing this ? You people framed Susanne Modeski . You plan to test that chemical on an unwitting public . Why ? For what possible reason ? Byers , shut up . Who gives you the authority ? No bags . W-Whoa , guys . Behave yourselves . That 's it ? ! You 're just trying to intimidate us ? To scare us so we 'll keep quiet ? Byers , I swear to God , I 'll shoot you myself . It 's all true what Susanne said about you people , isn 't it ? About John F. Kennedy , Dallas ? I heard it was a lone gunman . And that was the last we saw of him . Almost immediately , the police got there . We ... panicked and hid . You know the rest . Do I look like Geraldo to you ? Don 't lie to me like I 'm Geraldo . I 'm not Geraldo ! Oh , man . It 's not all a bad dream . I am in hell . Oh , women . Ain 't it the truth ? What do you mean , " women " ? You know exactly what he means . Your molar-pulling girlfriend roped us in and left us swinging in the breeze . Is that what you meant ? Look , she is hot , but you got to admit- - we 're here because of her . I 'm here because I wanted to learn the truth . I assume that was the same for you . Susanne opened my eyes to it . She doesn 't owe me anything . If there was some way I could help her still , I 'd ... I 'd do it in a second . Apparently , Agent Mulder came to and verified your warehouse story- - at least , what little he seems to recall of it . Three cheers for the FBI . You guys are free to go . Come on . Let 's go . Here 's a tip . Aluminum foil makes a lovely hat , and it blocks out the government 's mind control rays . Keep you guys out of trouble . One green nylon wallet containing $ 38 in cash . One ... whatever in the hell this is . Detective ? We got a stolen car that turned up at the train station . It 's the one that the FBI agent was driving . Okay . Susanne must have taken Mulder 's car last night . She left it at the train station . - So ? - So maybe we can catch up with her . Where ? She took a train . She 's too smart for that . Don 't you see ? She just ... she just meant to throw them off . She said she wanted to go public . The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station . Susanne ! You okay ? John . They didn 't believe my story- - not a word of it . Who in their right mind would ? What are you going to do now ? Try other newspapers , TV stations . Not give up . Keep trying to find people who will listen- - people like you . I appreciate what you did for me . All three of you . We still want to help . You already have . Guys ... No matter how paranoid you are , you 're not paranoid enough . Tell the truth . Reach as many people as you can with it . That 's your weapon . Susanne ? ! You feeling better ? Yeah , I am . Thank you . I just , um ... I have these weird ideas in my head that I can 't seem to shake . What kind of ideas ? Weird ones . Y-You going to bust us ? I 'm not sure yet . I just spoke with my A.S.A.C. , and he tells me that Dr. Susanne Modeski is no longer wanted by the FBI . She 's still missing , but the case is suddenly closed . What I need from you guys is to tell me what the hell happened last night . You want the truth ? Yeah , I want the truth . You might want to sit down . This is going to take a while . The truth is , none of us is safe . Secret elements within the United States Government seek to surveil us and control our lives . What ? ! Tell him about the hotel room Bibles . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I 'm coming to that . It all started with Susanne Modeski . I made this !

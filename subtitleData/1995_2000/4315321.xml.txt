 [ Weapon Cocking ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Indistinct Chattering ] You in charge here ? Lieutenant Kraskow . Is the bureau taking over ? You 're welcome to any help that I can give you , but that 's not why I 'm here . - What can you tell me ? - Silent alarm tripped 30 minutes ago . We think there 's one robber , armed . It 's probably a handgun . Definitely no pro , or he would 've been long gone . A single gunshot about 20 minutes ago . Blinds are down , but we think we 've got a body on the floor . But you 're not here to take over ? Two of my agents might be in there . - Skinner ! Skinner ! - Hold it right there ! - Do I know you ? - Stop this ! Don 't let this happen ! Pull ' em back , Skinner ! [ Breathing Heavily ] You 're in charge here , you know . It doesn 't have to end like this . [ Door Opening ] - Yeah , it does . - No ! [ Gasps ] Son of a- - [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] Yes , yes . [ Telephone Ringing ] - [ Clattering ] - [ Ringing Continues ] Hello ? It 's coming through down there ? It 's my damn water bed . My damn water bed sprung a leak . I-I-I know I 'm not supposed to have a water bed . I don 't know what to tell you . I-I-I think it was a gift . All right . - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - I know . - I missed the meeting . - No , you didn 't miss the meeting . You 're extraordinarily late for the meeting . - It 's still going on . - What are you doing down here ? We took a short break , and I came looking for you . What are you doing down here ? I 'm having the best damn day of my life . Any moment , I 'm about to burst into song- - " " Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah . " " My water bed sprung a leak and shorted out my alarm clock . My cell phone got wet and crapped out on me , and the check I wrote my landlord to cover the damages ... is gonna bounce if I don 't deposit my pay . You ever have one of those days , Scully ? Since I 've been working here ? Yeah . When did you get a water bed , Mulder ? Bank 's just down the street . I 'll-I 'll be back in ten . Cover for me , will ya ? When do I not ? [ Horns Honking ] - Jerk ! - Yeah ? You want some ? We good ? - Pam ? - Go run your errand already . Yeah . I just got to go pick something up . No biggie . Right , Bernard . No biggie . I 'll be ten minutes . Wait here for me . - Hey , man , you need to watch it next time ! - You watch it ! Right on schedule . Poor guy . He never did that before . Okay . Thank you . And that 's assuming ... these trends continue well into the coming year . Um , other D.O.J. projections ... estimate a larger two to three percent drop ... in the overall homicide rate ... versus the one to one and a half percent ... cited in the earlier Tanner study . However , there is some dispute ... that the statistical methodology in this latter study ... is not the D.O.J.-preferred methodology . In any case , added variables ... make crime trends for the coming year ... particularly hard to predict . [ Sighs ] The unpredictable future . Which brings us to Agent Mulder . Will he or will he not grace us with his report ? [ Door Opens , Closes ] May I help the next in line , please ? Customers , face down ! - You know what this is ! - Oh , God ! - You ! On the floor ! - Oh , God ! Don 't shoot us ! - Shut up ! - You 're the boss . - [ Sobbing ] - It 's all right . All right , I 'm the boss ! No silent alarms , no dye packs . Do it like the insurance company taught you . Start with the counter money . Quicker you go , quicker I go . Everybody else , out here on the floor . Ah ! Leave the last one . No tricks . All right , come on . Come on , come on , come on . Zip-a-dee-doo-dah . All right , get your keys . Come around here . We 're gonna open up the A.T.M. Hey , lock the doors . You forgot to lock the front door . On the ground ! [ Woman Screams ] Drop it ! Drop it now ! You drop it ! You drop it . Travel expense reimbursement . Who 's got those figures ? All I 've got here is third and fourth quarter . - No ? - Assistant Director ? [ Siren Wailing ] [ Tires Screeching ] Go , go , go . Go , go , go ! Sir ? Okay . - Who 's in charge here ? - I am . Unless the bureau 's taking over . - [ Pam ] Skinner ! - [ Man ] Hey , hold it ! Skinner ! Don 't let them charge in there . - Skinner ! - Do I know you ? Skinner ! They 're supposed to call , right ? They 're not gonna call . - What 's your name ? - Yeah . Look , I gotta call you something , right ? How about Steve ? It 's a nice , honest name . Steve . Bernard . Bernard . I have to get my partner out of here . I am blowing this whole freaking place right off the map if they come in here . Oh , look . They don 't know that . Don 't you realize that ? They can 't see you . They don 't know what your plan is . They better know . They damn well better figure it out . Look- - Just walk in front of the door and show them . You want to get me killed ! Oh , God . I just want everybody to live . That 's all . I just- - Just show them . You have control over everything that happens here . You do . And it doesn 't have to end this way . [ Door Opening ] Yeah , it does . No ! Okay . Oh , son of a- - [ Sighs ] Son of a bitch . That 's great . [ Telephone Ringing ] Yeah ? It 's coming through down there ? [ Sighs ] It 's my damn water bed . It sprung a leak . Yeah , I- - I know I 'm not supposed to have a water bed . I don 't know what to tell you . I-I- - I 'm sorry . I mean , I- - Oh ! [ Telephone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Line Ringing ] Who you calling ? - Nobody . - What do you mean , nobody ? - It 's gotta be somebody . - It 's nobody you know , Bernard . Forget it . There 's something I gotta do . I want you to come . I 'm not going with you . Look , I 'm not asking . Pam ? Don 't go gettin all weird on me . It 'll only take a couple of minutes . Look , Bernard , just go to work . It 's not too late . I 'm not going to work today . - And don 't say they 're gonna fire me . - I wasn 't gonna say that . 'Cause you know what ? Who cares ? Like there 's a big future in mopping floors . Like that 's something to lose . - We lose everything . - No , no . I got a plan . This time tomorrow , Pam- - Everything will be roses . Aw . - Damn it . I know . - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - I missed the meeting . - Well , not yet , but only because it 's the longest in F.B.I. history . - What are you doing down here , then ? - Well , I came looking for you . We took a five-minute break three minutes ago . Mulder , your cell phone 's not working . - Did you oversleep ? - Scully , did you ever have one of those days ... you wish you could just rewind and start all over again from the beginning ? Yes . Frequently . But , I mean , who 's to say that if you did rewind it and start over again ... that it wouldn 't end up exactly the same way ? So you think it 's all just fate ? We have no free will ? No , I think that we 're free to be the people that we are- - good , bad or indifferent . I think that it 's our character that determines our fate . And all the rest is just preordained ? I don 't buy that . There 's too many variables . Too many forks in the road . I meant to be on time to work this morning , but my water bed springs a leak , flooding my apartment and the apartment below me , so that makes me late for the meeting . And then I realize I gotta write a check to cover the damages to my landlord , but as I 'm walking to work , I realize that 's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay . So now I gotta go to the bank , which makes me even later . Since when did you get a water bed ? I-I might just as easily not have a water bed , and then I 'd be on time for this meeting . You might just as easily have stayed in medicine ... and not gone into the F.B.I. , and then we would never have met . - Blah , blah , blah . - Fate . Free will . With every choice , you change your fate . Then let 's change yours . I will deposit your check . You gather your files , go to Skinner 's office , give your report ... before he takes it out on both of us . Endorsed my damn check stub . Mulder ! Don 't go in the bank today . Excuse me ? Bernard 's in there . Please , don 't go in the bank . I 'm sorry . Do I know you ? You pass me every day on the street . Every single day . This day , on your way to the bank . And then you go inside , and everybody gets killed- - you , your partner , Bernard , everybody . I pass you , and then we die . Yes . Over and over . Only last time , you looked at me- - you looked at me like you knew me . Like you remembered . Please remember me . [ Gunshot ] Don 't go . [ Horns Honking , Tires Screeching ] - Drop your weapon ! - Drop it . I ain 't dropping ' nothing . You put yours down . I 'll shoot her ! What do you think I 'll do then ? Bernard . That 's your name , right ? Bernard , she 's not dead . You 're not a murderer yet . You can end this the right way . Sir , please . Listen to them . Don 't hurt anybody else . A whole lot of police are coming . You tripped the alarm . - No ! - [ Explosion ] [ Groans ] [ Telephone Ringing ] Yeah , I know . Yeah , I know . I-I know already . I 'll pay for it . - [ Thud ] - Ow ! [ Computer V oice ] The cellular customer you are trying to reach is- - - [ Pam ] Agent Scully . - Yes ? Please , don 't go inside the bank today . - The bank ? - Cradock Marine- - Eighth Street branch . - A block from here . - Uh , I 'm not following . Did-Did you get separated from your tour ? I 'm here to see you . I 'm begging you . Please don 't go this time . Don 't let Mulder go either . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - Um , I 'm sorry- - - [ Man ] Excuse me , miss ? You 're not supposed to be in this area . If you walk in that bank , you 'll die . Both of you . [ Scoffs ] - Oh , hey . Did I miss the meeting ? - Hey . Huh ? No . No . We , uh , took a five-minute break about three minutes ago . Uh , Mulder , your cell phone 's not working . - Wow , that is so strange . - What ? I just got the weirdest sensation of deja vu . I 've been having it all morning . - Well , that 's fairly common . - Yeah , but never to this degree . I mean , I woke up , I opened my eyes , I was soaking wet . It 's a long story , but I had the distinct sensation ... that I had lived that moment before . Well , you may have . Did you do a lot of drinking in college ? I wonder what it means . Mulder , I don 't see why it has to mean anything . Well , you know , some Freudians believe the deja vu phenomenon ... to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious - - that it represents a desire to , uh , have a second chance , to set things right . - Set what kind of things right ? - Whatever 's wrong . Mulder , it 's more likely that we 're talking about a simple neurochemistry- - a glitch in the brain 's ability ... to process recognition and memory . Doesn 't mean that the memory 's authentic . Yeah ? Well , but what if it were ? What if you 'd lived this moment before , and now you 're living it again ? Yeah , so that I could right some wrong , or change fate . Well , right now I 'd say ... you 're fated to go to this meeting . No , actually , I 'm fated to go to the bank . Mulder . What bank ? - Cradock . Right down the street . - Eighth Street ? What ? [ Sighs ] S- - Some woman just stopped me in the hallway not ten minutes ago . She knew both of our names , and she warned against either of us entering ... into the Cradock branch on Eighth Street . She said that we 'd die . What did she look like ? Five-eight , thin , green eyes , dyed hair . M-Maybe you know her . Maybe ... it 's just somebody pulling a prank . I 'll use the A.T.M. machine . I don 't wanna tempt fate . All right , our next order of business is federal crime projections . - Who 's got those figures ? - Uh , right here . Um , if you all could just bear with me one second . Uh , " " Federal crime projections . " " - Do you remember me ? - You match a description . You 're the , uh- - You 're the woman that gave a warning ... to my partner , aren 't you ? Uh , have we met ? More times than I can count . Right here on this sidewalk . Usually , you walk right by . You 'll pass a few minutes earlier , a few minutes later . Little details , they change , but it always ends the same . What always ends the same ? I keep having this conversation . We go inside the bank ... and we all die . That 's what you told my partner . Is-Is something going to happen inside the bank ? Is there going to be a robbery ? Every time I tell you there 's going to be a robbery , you run in there to try to stop it , and that 's when things go bad . Don 't you see ? We 're all in hell . I 'm the only one who knows it . Something went very wrong on this day the first time around . Something got screwed up . Things didn 't end the way they were supposed to . Now it 's like a needle stuck in a groove . You 're saying this day repeats over and over again . Until we get it right . Till my boyfriend doesn 't blow up that bank . I have tried everything to stop him . I 've hid his keys , I 've- - I 've drugged his coffee . I even called the police on him myself . He always gets here . He 's meant to . It 's you . It 's you and your partner every time . If it wasn 't for you , nobody would die . If what you 're saying is true , how come I don 't remember it ? How come you 're the only one ? That 's got to be 50 times you 've asked me that . - No , 51 . What 's the answer ? - I don 't know . I just do . Be glad you don 't . Please . You can stop this . You 're the variable . It has to be you . I have tried everyone else . All I 'm asking is just walk away . That 's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year . Other D.O.J. projections ... estimate a larger two to three percent drop ... in the overall homicide rate ... versus the , uh , one to one and a half percent ... cited in the earlier Tanner study . However , there is some dispute that - - Um , excuse me , Agent Arnold . Um , where 's Scully ? She just left , Mulder , I assume to look for you . Uh , excuse me . - [ Door Closes ] - Um - - Everybody , face down ! You know what this is ! - Give me the money ! - Oh , God ! Oh , God . You ! On the floor ! [ Woman ] Oh , God ! You 're gonna shoot us ? - Oh , God , he 's gonna - - - Shut up ! He 's gonna shoot us ! Please don 't kill us ! - Please don 't do this ! - Shut up ! Give me the money ! Don 't shoot us ! Don 't shoot us ! Damn it , shut up ! Hey ! Hey ! Get your hands up where I can see ' em ! Do it ! Do it now ! - Drop your weapon ! - [ Gunshot ] [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Softly ] He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - I know , I know . I missed the meeting . You didn 't miss the meeting . You 're extraordinarily late for the meeting . The bank 's just down the street . Cover for me , will you ? [ Honking Horn ] [ Sighs ] We good , Pam ? - Pam ? - I know . You just gotta go pick something up . No biggie . What is it with you ? Why are you always in a mood ? 'Cause nothing ever changes . Things are gonna change . You wait and see . I 'll be ten minutes . Wait here for me . [ Exhales ] [ Door Slams Shut ] [ Man ] Hey , man , you need to watch it next time ! [ Bernard ] You watch it ! - Do I know you ? - Do you ? - Yeah , you just look really familiar to me . - Do I ? Yeah . No ? All right , I 'm-I 'm sorry to bother you . May I help the next in line , please ? [ Softly ] He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . He 's got a bomb . [ Man ] ... estimate a larger two to three percent drop ... in the overall homicide rate ... versus the one to one and a half percent ... cited in the earlier Tanner study . However , there 's some dispute ... that the statistical methodology ... in this latter study ... is not the D.O.J. - preferred methodology . In any case , added variables ... make crime trends for the coming year - - Excuse me . Agent Scully ? Excuse me . It 's Agent Mulder , and he said it 's urgent . - Mulder , where are you ? - I 'm at the bank . Yeah , I know where you are , but what 's taking so long ? Scully , I need you to do something for me right now . [ Tapping ] - Ma 'am , will you come with me ? - Why ? - Just come with me , please . - What 's this about ? My partner said you 'd know . Take it . I 'm a federal agent . I don 't want us all to die in here . What are you talking about ? You 've got a girlfriend outside in the car , and you 've got a bomb . Something very bad is gonna happen here today , and I want you to know that I 'm not gonna let it happen . But if you walk out that door right now , I 'm not gonna stop you . - You 're in charge here , Bernard . - You 're damn right . You can change your fate . Everybody down , now ! You know what this is ! No ! Oh , God ! - Get down ! - If you don 't believe me , ask her . - Drop it ! - Get away from her , Pam . This isn 't gonna work . You can 't be in here . - Drop it now ! - You drop it . - Listen to me , Bernard- - - You get her out of here ! You get her out of here . You 're dooming her by doing this . You 're making her live this day over and over again - - her , you , me . - All of us ! - What the hell are you talking about ? Every day you die in here , and every day it starts all over again . You can 't want this for her . It 's hell ! Hell ? I 'm doing this for her . Listen to him , Bernard . Put your damn gun down ! Put your gun down , Scully . Trust me . It 's the only way to get out of here . You gotta put your gun down and let them out . He 's got a bomb . [ Gun Hits Floor ] Come on , Bernard . Let 's go . [ Siren Wailing ] - You son of a bitch ! - No ! [ Gunshot ] [ Labored Breathing ] This is Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I. This never happened before . - [ Ringing ] - Yeah ? Mulder , it 's me . - I 'm late again , aren 't I , Scully ? - No , not yet . But Skinner wants to see us in his office as soon as possible . He 's asking for our report on the robbery yesterday . I 'll be there in an hour . I 'd like to hear it too . - Well , you were there , Scully . - That 's not what I mean . You still won 't explain what happened yesterday- - how you knew that Bernard Oates was strapped with explosives . Call it a feeling . And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice waiting in the car ? I don 't think she was an accomplice . I think she was just trying to get away . Are you okay ? I 'll be there in an hour . [ Beeps ] [ Child ] I made this ! [ Child ] I made this !

 All right , everyone . We 've run out of time . That 's all for tonight . If you haven 't finished , you 'll have more time next week . - Hey , man ! - Excuse me . - FBI ! Stay where you are ! - Get the light on him ! John Mostow , we have a warrant for your arrest ! - You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . Do you understand each of these rights that I have explained to you ? Do you wish to give up your right to remain silent ? Argh ! God ! He bit me ! - The son of a bitch bit me like a dog ! - Get him outta here ! - Nemhauser , are you OK ? - Yeah , yeah . Oh my God . John Mostow . Unemployed house painter . Divorced . No children . He came to the US from Uzbekistan during perestroika . Failed to mention on his INS application that he spent his twenties in an insane asylum . He was arrested last week for the murders of at least seven men . You thought all they produced were great hockey players . The crimes took place in a three-year period . All the victims were male , aged 17 to 25 . Was there a signature or a defining MO ? According to the ME , there was no evidence of any sexual assault . Death was caused by massive blood loss due to facial mutilation . He also reported that the wound pattern on all the victims was identical . It 's on page 3 . " Both eyes punctured . Signature gashes from the corners of the mouth to the ears . " The level of violence and overkill suggests the work of a very angry individual . Or individuals . If you count the spirit Mostow says possessed him during the murders . Possession is a common claim by criminals with dissociative disorders . They distance themselves from their actions . That was the operational opinion until last night ... .. when a 19-year-old male was found dead six miles from here with identical facial wounds . - A copycat ? - According to Assistant Director Skinner , ... .. the details of the mutilations were never released . Only the crime team had that information . And Mostow 's been in custody for five days . Please ! The light hurts my eyes ! Leave me alone . You have a nice , soft bunk , sir . Why aren 't you using it ? Because he 's been working . Haven 't you , John ? What is it ? What is this thing ? - It killed those men . - Does it have a name ? Does it have a name to go with that face ? - All men know its name . - What do you call it ? Satan ? The Devil ? Or maybe it 's just the name of your accomplice . - I had no accomplice ! - You killed all those young men yourself ? It killed them ! How many times do I have to tell you ? Its fingerprints weren 't on the murder weapon . Yours were . It won 't be tried for murder under the death penalty . Which is why it laughs at fools like you . And you . Fools who would pretend evil can be brought to heel like a brindle bitch . Or be held by your pathetic gulags . While , with a snap of its finger , ... .. it makes men lick the greasy floor of hell ... just to see its reflection . Is that what it did last night , John ? Snapped its fingers and let another young man die ? It killed again ? Yesterday ? It 's found somebody . Somebody new . Just like it found me . Agent Mulder ? Can I see you two outside ? So what is it , Mulder ? Little green men ? Evil spirits ? Hounds of hell ? Scully , this is Bill Patterson . He runs the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico . Yes , I know . Behavioural science : you wrote the book . It 's an honour , sir . Is that what you think , too ? That the suspect is possessed by some dark spirit ? - No , not at all , sir . - Strange company you keep , then . It always amazed me how you never fit your own profile . No one would ever guess how really mean-spirited you are . The arrest of John Mostow was the result of three years of hard work by my unit . Three years . You can imagine how upset we were by this latest murder , ... .. and by the suspect floating this possession theory . You think he 's got an accomplice , then . Even though your own profile of Mostow says he 's working alone . My profile led to his arrest . No , he acted alone . And that murder last night was done by a second killer , and he acted alone , too . What about these drawings of Mostow 's , these gargoyles ? - Know why he draws those ? Did you ask ? - I didn 't get a chance to . He says he draws them to keep this demon of his away . That makes sense . Historically , gargoyles were used to ward off evil spirits . - Like on the eaves of Notre Dame . - Mulder , I don 't need a history lesson . And I don 't need anyone indulging this guy 's story . I was asked to look into this case . If you 've got a problem with that , take it up with AD Skinner . So you 're not gonna tell me when your love affair with Patterson ended ? Patterson never liked me . Weren 't you considered the fair-haired boy at the Bureau ? - Not by Patterson . - Why not ? I didn 't wanna get my knees dirty . Couldn 't quite cast myself in the role of the dutiful student . - You mean you couldn 't worship him . - Something like that , yeah . From what I hear , there were a lot of men who did . A lot of men joined the FBI because they wanted to be him . Yeah . Patterson had this saying about tracking a killer : if you wanted to know an artist , you had to look at his art . What he meant was : if you wanted to catch a monster , you had to become one yourself . In this case I 'd say it served him pretty well . This guy 's definitely some kind of monster . It 's just a cat . I thought it was one of these pictures coming to life . Our guys must have locked it in here . No . He 's obviously got his own key to the place . There 's air coming through here . There must be something on the other side of the wall . It 's a door . Why don 't you wait till we can get more light in here ? I 've got some light . See anything ? More gargoyles , Scully . Lots of ' em . - Sculpted in clay . - Why would he keep ' em in a secret room ? Mulder ? Mulder , what is it ? What do you see ? Mulder ! Will you tell me what 's going on in there ? Aaarghhhh ! We 're monitoring him very closely , but I 'm not encouraged by what I 'm seeing . - He 's lucky to be alive . - Thank you , Doctor . Agent Scully . We searched Mostow 's studio . There are no more bodies . - How many were recovered ? - Five , all dismembered . All young men whose faces were mutilated . - Just like the latest victim , so I hear . - At least this one 's still alive . Same signature facial mutilation , right down to the choice of weapon , by the look of it . - What does Patterson say ? - I haven 't spoken with him yet . But I bet he 'll think it 's someone working directly with Mostow . I 'd have to agree with that theory . What 's Agent Mulder think ? He thinks our finding Mostow 's secret gallery won 't do him any favours with Patterson . Between us , I think Patterson secretly went to Skinner and requested Mulder on this case . He requested him ? I 've worked with Patterson for three years on this . This just about killed him until we finally got a break and arrested Mostow . But then this first copycat murder ... it really threw him for a loss . Mulder believes Patterson never thought too highly of him . That 's just Patterson . Late night , couple of beers in him , ... .. he starts telling ' me Mulder stories , how he 's some kind of crack genius . - Stitches . What happened ? - Mostow bit me during the arrest . How 's our victim ? - Has he been able to ID his attacker ? - The doctors say it 's too early to even try . They 're not even sure if he 's gonna make it . Where 's Mulder ? Seeing what he can find out about those drawings of Mostow 's . What 's he lookin ' for ? The same thing you are , sir . A second killer . I think you should take this conversation outside . Stay with us . The name is from the French , " Gargouille " , ... .. the name of a medieval dragon which prowled the River Seine , ... .. whose horrible image became the symbol of the souls of the condemned turned to stone . Or of the devils and demons of the underworld spared eternal damnation . The embodiment of the lesser forces who inspired dread ... .. and the threat of our own damnation . Ushers into hell or into the realm of our own dark fears and imagination . For over 1200 years the grotesque image has found its expression ... .. in stone , clay , wood , oil and charcoal . Born again and again , as if resurrecting itself through tortured human expression , ... .. almost as if it existed , haunting men inwardly ... .. so that it might haunt mankind for eternity . As it must have haunted John Mostow . But what impulses moved him to kill ? Could this be the same dark force at work - its ultimate expression the destruction of the flesh , of the very hand that creates it ? Is this evil something born in each of us , ... .. crouching in the shadow of every human soul , waiting to emerge ? A monster that violates our bodies and twists our will to do its bidding ? Is this the monster called madness ? They 're closin ' up in a few minutes . So , is this how you 're lookin for the second killer ? Tell me , Mulder . What do you really expect to find here ? I 'm not sure yet . But you must have some idea . Some theory . I 've got a few . I 'm just tryin ' to stitch ' em together . - With your face stuck in a book . - You said it yourself , Bill : if you want to know the artist , look at the art . I 'm finally agreeing with you . I know where you 're going with this . I 've been there myself . You 're wasting your time . Then why was this man compelled to draw and sculpt the same face again and again ? - Why is he still doing it now ? - Because he 's insane . This is nothing but the scrawling of a madman . He said this wants to see its own reflection . Mostow has said everything but what I need to hear : the name of his accomplice . - Unless he 's telling the truth . - About being possessed ? I am really disappointed in you . I wouldn 't want to disappoint you by not disappointing you . After all this time I thought maybe you 'd finally put your feet back on the ground . Clearly I was mistaken . - Mulder ? Mulder , it 's me . Mulder ? You weren 't at home , in your office ... I was scared , Mulder . I didn 't know where you were . I kept trying your cellphone but you didn 't answer . It was turned off . You turned your phone off ? Why do you even bother carrying it ? You 're all set . See a doctor tomorrow , in case of infection . - Thanks . - Sure . Mulder , what were you doing in Mostow 's studio ? - I was working . - At 3.30 in the morning ? I haven 't seen or spoken to you in almost two days . You didn 't return my calls . - This thing exists , Scully . It 's real . - " It " ? What are you talking about ? - Whatever keeps killing those young men . - Mostow killed them . And out of some sick alliance , someone is continuing where he left off . Whatever attacked me wasn 't a person . Well , did you actually see it ? Maybe you 've just seen what you want to see . What makes you think I would want to see that ? ! I didn 't imagine it , Scully . Listen to yourself , Mulder . Listen to what you 're saying . You 're starting to sound like ... Look , when I couldn 't reach you , I went to your apartment . I saw your new wallpaper . Don 't you realise what is happening here ? He is testing you . He is the reason you were brought on this case in the first place . Patterson ? He requested your involvement through Skinner 's office . I checked . Mulder , where are you going ? - So , how 's Mulder holding up ? - Sir , can I have a minute ? - Of course . - In private ? - What 's this about ? - Maybe you can tell me . I 'm curious about what you 're doing concerning Agent Mulder . - I don 't know what you 're referring to . - I think you do , sir . You knew exactly how he would respond when you brought him on this case . You did request him , didn 't you ? If you 're concerned about Agent Mulder 's behaviour , you should take that up with him . - You know I already have . - Then what do you expect me to do ? Just be honest with me about what you 're trying to do . Is this payback for what happened eight years ago , because Mulder quit the ISU ? - My motivations aren 't that petty . - Then why ? I asked for Mulder because ... .. I wanna close the book on this godforsaken case once and for all . And you knew that he could help you solve it . My advice to you , Scully ... Let Mulder do what he has to do . Don 't get in his way . And don 't try to hold him back . Because you won 't be able to . Why didn 't it kill me like it killed the others ? Why did it let me live ? Even if I could tell you why , you would not understand . Help me to understand , John . - Please , go away . - No . You have to help me go deeper . Help me get inside its head like it got inside yours so I can understand what it wants . - It wants what it wants . - To kill men by carving up their faces ? You have felt its hunger . Felt your bones rattled by its frozen breath . So you know ... nothing can be done . Unless I find it . Then what will you do ? Just tell me how to find it , John . - No . - Just tell me how to find this thing . You can 't find it . Only it can find you . Maybe ... .. it already has . First time up I struck out . All three pieces were clean . But on my second try , I got lucky . I dusted the blade with Redwop . - I 'm sorry ? - " Powder " , spelt backwards . It 's what we call the fluorescent lycopodium . - Looks like a partial index . - And , on the handle , almost a full thumb . It 's the placement of the prints that struck me . Where someone would 've gripped the knife . Which is why I thought I had your guy . Except I wasn 't as lucky as I thought when I ran the prints against the NCIC database . - Your message said you identified them . - I did . He 's one of our own people . - An FBI agent ? - Your partner . These are Mulder 's prints ? Are you sure ? I double-checked . Why ? I assumed he must have been the one that recovered the knife at the crime scene . Excuse me . - Use that table up front ? - It 's OK . Just put it on the floor . - I need to get that . Excuse me , Agent Scully ? Assistant Director Skinner 's asked to see you right away . - Come in . - You wanted to see me , sir ? - Yes . Sit down . I heard they found you in Evidence . Looking for the murder weapon in this Mostow case ? Yes , sir . - Did you find it ? - No , sir . Is it your opinion the missing evidence is the weapon you found at the crime scene today ? I 'm not absolutely certain . But Agent Mulder 's prints were found on it . Yes , sir . Have you seen Agent Mulder or spoken to him about this ? No , sir . Do you have any insight into Agent Mulder 's current disposition or mental state ? I know Agent Mulder is working very hard on this case at your request , sir . Are you worried about him , Agent Scully ? No , sir . Off the record . So am I. Aaarghh ! Yeah , this is Greg Nemhauser . Please call me right away at 555-0143 . I need to talk to you right away about a po ... - Hello ? - Mulder ? - Scully ? - Where are you ? In Mostow 's studio . - Are you with Nemhauser ? - No . Should I be ? Well , that 's who I was calling . He left this number on my answering machine . - Mulder ? - Yeah . Do you know where he is ? I 'm not sure . Mulder , that knife that we recovered from the crime scene . I think it 's the one Mostow used . What makes you say that ? Mostow 's was stolen from Evidence . When ? I was hoping maybe you could tell me . Your prints were all over it . Yeah , I examined Mostow 's knife yesterday in the Evidence Room . - Why ? - Because I wanted to hold it . I wanted to see what it felt like in my hand . - But why ? - Look , Scully , I didn 't take it . OK , Mulder . Listen to me carefully . I want you to stay exactly where you are . I 'm gonna be there in a few minutes ... .. and we 're gonna work this thing out together . OK ? - Mulder ? - Yeah . - Mulder . - What are you doin ' here ? - What are you doing here ? - It 's Nemhauser . - But you already knew that , didn 't you ? - What is this ? You killed him , Bill . When he suspected it was you , you killed him . - Are you outta your mind ? - Not me . - Not now . - Put that gun down . Not until you tell me what you 're doing here . What I 'm doing here ? ! Look at your hands . Now ask yourself what you 're doing here . - I 'm not sure . - You 're here because John Mostow ... .. stole three years of your life . Every day and night for three years ... .. you lived and dreamed the horror show that was in his head , and I 'm sorry , ... .. imagining everything he imagined , ... .. sinking deeper and deeper into the ugliness , just like you taught us to do . But when you caught him , it didn 't just go away , all that violence . It stayed alive inside you , till it had to come out . But you didn 't wanna do what you were doing . You wanted to stop , but you couldn 't . Not by yourself . That 's why you called on me , couldn 't kill me when you had the chance . - Mulder ! What the hell are you doing ? ! - Scully , get that light off me ! - First put the gun down ! - You don 't understand ! Why do you have a gun on Agent Patterson ? It 's him , Scully . Mulder ? ! You OK , Mulder ? You should call an ambulance . His pulse is still strong . This is Agent Mulder with the FBI . I have a man down with a gunshot wound . Oh , God ! Are you listening to me ? For God 's sakes , isn 't someone listening to me ? ! I didn 't do it ! It wasn 't me ! I didn 't kill them ! Please ! We work in the dark . We do what we can to battle the evil that would otherwise destroy us . But if a man 's character is his fate , this fight is not a choice but a calling . Yet sometimes this burden causes us to falter , ... .. breaching the fragile fortress of our mind , ... .. allowing the monsters without to turn within . And we are left alone , staring into the abyss , ... .. into the laughing face of madness . Visiontext Subtitles : Doreen Trenerry I made this !

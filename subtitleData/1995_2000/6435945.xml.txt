 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman . [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science , ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! No heart of gold- - just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people ? It 's alive . Alive ! There she is , Sylvie Tyler . After the sudden , tragic break up with her boyfriend , she 's a free agent again . Just waiting for the next nice guy to ask her out . And that guy is gonna be you , Gary . It 's gonna be me . I can feel it . You ready ? I 'm ready . Uh-oh . Trouble . Carl Cleghorn . This school ain 't big enough for the both of us . Ah ! [ LAUGHTER ] Dude , you OK ? Tell me you money on Carl . We 'll split it . Come on . It was luck of the draw . Carl could 've slipped in the milk just as easily as you did . Wrong . Family curse . Whenever it comes to a showdown of any kind , a Wallace is gonna lose . Tell that to your great great granddaddy Dad . What are you doing here ? You forgot your lunch . You know , 100 years ago , your ancestor , Red Brick Wallace , did the family name proud in a showdown to end all showdowns . Red Brick licked four good-for-nothing cowpokes single handed . So don 't forget , you come from proud stock , boy . Oh , uh , I backed over it with a tow truck . Sorry . Couldn 't save the pudding up . See you , boys . Proud stock . More like chicken stock . He 's telling the truth . Your great great granddaddy was a hero . Made all the papers 100 years ago . Here . Red Brick Wallace Dispatches Four Ruffians in a Showdown . No kidding ? My ancestor was a bad ass gun fighter ? Cool . I gotta meet this guy . Maybe I can pick up a few pointers . Can you make it happen , Lis ? Get ready , cowpokes , and hang onto your spurs . We 're going back to the Old West . Yee haw ! Does he have to come ? Whoa . Ugh . Sorry . Welcome to 1895 , guys . So where 's my great great grandad ? Polishing his six gun ? Duking it out with some cattle rustlers ? Try emptying spit pots . Wallace Spittoon Company ? Hey , Red . Got one for you . [ DING ] So the Wallace legend is born . I don 't think we 're blending in very well . I 'll zap us up some hats , chaps , and bustiers . [ BUZZING ] What gives ? Hm . There are no power lines . No generators . My magic feeds on electricity . So no juice , no magic ? No magic , no time travel . We 're stuck in the Old West . I don 't wanna panic anyone , but they don 't get cable around here for another 90 years . We have to find a way to make electricity . It 's our only way home . Great idea , professor . Ginger and I can go get some coconuts so you can make a battery . Coconuts , that 's ridiculous . We need potatoes . Well , we might as well make the best of it while we 're here . Look at me . I 'm a cowboy . Howdy , partner . Name 's Wyatt . Wyatt Earp . Wyatt Earp ? You killed my brother . No ! Kidding ! Ha ha ! I 'm Wyatt Donnelly . Donnelly . I was joking . Joking ? There he is . My ancestor . The fastest spittoon shiner in the west . It 's honest work . Give him a chance . Hi . So you , uh , cleaning the old spittoon there ? Nope . Turning it . Tuning ? [ DING ] - Yeah . Believe me . A good ring will make the whole saloon sound a whole lot more pleasant . Suppose there 's a science to everything . Yeah . [ RINGING ] [ WHISTLING ] It 's weird not having my magic . Normally , I 'd zap that guy into a toasted bagel . Now all I can do is this . Howdy , slim . Uh , actually , name 's Wyatt . Donnelly . Wyatt Donnelly . Oh . Sorry about that . Hey , spit boy ! Get your hide over here . Got a powerful spitter brewing . All done ? Yeah . [ GUNSHOTS ] [ LAUGHTER ] I lose more spittoons this way . How can you let him get away with that ? No choice . Them there 's the Devil 's Hand Gang . They 're the meanest bunch of cattle rustling , horse thieving , gun toting , whiskey guzzling , card cheating , haiku writing- - OK . OK , already . MAN : The sheriff 's coming ! I heard shooting . Anybody dead ? Nope . Too bad . What do you care , Sheriff ? It 's not like you 'd have done anything . If it had been you , I 'd have had a drink and celebrated . [ LAUGHING ] Is it me , or does the Sheriff seem familiar ? Looks like you 've got some family branches in the Old West yourself . Why do I get the feeling that before this wish is over , I 'm in for a frontier-style nipple twister ? Not just any nipple twister . The skin pinchinest , flesh bruisinest , hair pullinest- - Shut up . So what 's our next step ? I told you to . We need potatoes . 80 pounds of potatoes ? Oh , me , I can 't eat put two in a sitting . You want me to cook them for you ? No . I need them raw . My . You are rugged . Begonia , darling . This little horsefly bothering you ? 'Cause if 'n he is , I 'll be glad to see that he don 't . Huh ? I 'm not after your woman . Honest . I 'm just looking for potatoes so I can make a crude battery . Potatoes ? You making fun of me , ain 't you , boy ? Easy , Snake . Kid 's new in town . He- - he don 't want no trouble . Nobody wants no trouble . How about I buy you a shot of whiskey ? And how about you minding your own business ? Come on , pretty thing . Let 's me and you get out of here . No . Let go of me , Snake . She don 't wanna go . Back off , spit pot . I 'm gonna regret this . You 're gonna be real sorry you did that , Red . Sheriff . You gotta do something . You 're right . Snake . Before you shoot him , I best remind you of something . You kill him , you bury him . Heh heh . Proceed ! Prepare to meet your maker . [ PIANO PLAYING ] [ CHEERING ] Polish my pistola . ( SINGING ) Like a virgin . Touched for the very first time . Like a virgin . When your heart beats next to mine . All my love , boy . That little filly just saved my life . She 's got a knack . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] ( SINGING ) Do a little dance . ( SINGING ) Do a little dance . ( SINGING ) Make a little love . ( SINGING ) Make a little love . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . ( SINGING ) Do a little dance . ( SINGING ) Do a little dance . ( SINGING ) Make a little love . ( SINGING ) Make a little love . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . ( SINGING ) Get down tonight . [ GUNSHOTS ] Help yourself to all you need . What are they for again ? It 's kind of hard to explain . Try . Well , I 'm constructing a crude power source by tapping into this potato and converting its chemical components into electrical energy . You sure do have a purdy mouth . Yeah . Well , thanks . Just remember , a man can 't live on taters alone . Can I help you ? I just wanted to make the acquaintance of my son-in-law to be ! I 'd like you to meet my pappy . Huh ? Thanks again for these canvas moccasins . They sure are comfy . Yeah . Good trade . I can do some major boot scootin ' in these babies . Well , boys . What y 'all wanna do today ? Been a long time since we burned a man 's business to the ground , Snake . Well , you know , Red 's got a business . Made out of wood , too . Heh . I reckon we found tonight 's entertainment . Now , fellows . You keep talking like that , I may have to arrest you . [ LAUGHTER ] You gonna take that ? Oh , no , no , no . Don 't give them no never mind . They 're just talking . My pappy used to say discretion 's the better part of valor . Only a fool picks a fight when he don 't have to . Well , somebody has to stand up to these guys . You got a problem there , beanpole ? Yeah , I do . Easy . They 're Too dangerous to get mixed up with . How can you say that ? You 're Red Brick Wallace . You 're supposed to be a hero . Red Brick , a hero ? Ha ha ! He ain 't no more a hero than the sheriff here 's a law man . Guilty as charged . [ LAUGHING ] Ha . Ha ha ha . What 's so funny ? I 'll tell you what 's funny . It just so happens that tomorrow , the Apple dumpling gang 's gonna get their butts kicked by Red Brick . Gary . You hear that , boys ? Spit Pot Red is gonna take all four of us on . Uh- - uh , do I have a say in this ? Not anymore . We 'll be seeing you tomorrow at noon . High noon . Hold on , Snake . I- - if we go and kill Red , where we gonna spit ? Damn it . I just got these . [ LAUGHING ] Forget about the boots . You just got me killed . I thought we was friends . What gives ? I set up the big match and that 's the thanks I get ? Gary . Did it ever occur to you that maybe Red won that fight because they didn 't know it was a-coming ? I mean coming . Uh , no . Congratulate me , guys . I 'm a star . What 's wrong ? Gary was kind enough to warn the bad guys about tomorrow 's big showdown . Like a little inside info 's gonna change history . Well , there 's only one way to find out . Cattle Stampede Endangers Town . Huh. the whole article 's gone . Look . Spittoon Repairman Dies in Scuffle . Oops . But if Red Brick Wallace dies- - Gary 's grandparents won 't be born . Or his parents . Or me . Looks like I 'm the center of attention . See ? They 're all staring . That 's because they know you 're the only man tough enough to take on the Devil 's Hand Gang . Yeah . And that I 'm gonna die . Yo , Snidely . You mind ? I 'm a 44 stout . Leave room for my boots . You don 't know for sure you 're gonna die . You might , you know , live . Good stuff . At high noon tomorrow , four ruthless desperadoes are gonna come gunning for your butt , and you 're sitting here tuning mouth toilets ? We need a plan . OK . How about this ? We dress Red up like a woman and sneak him out of town under the cover of darkness . I got a better idea . I 'll explain it was all a misunderstanding . I 'm sure they 'll listen to reason . No . That idea sucks . Those guys only listen to one thing . Lead . Go on . Show us what you can do . Oh , but- - Uh , fight fire with fire , Red . Fire with fire . Uh , what should I aim at ? How about the far wall ? Huh ? We 'll get harder . [ DINGING ] Woo hoo ! I got the hat . OK . Plan B. We fake your death and dig you up in a week . I still think we should dress him up as a woman . He 'd look so cute . Fine. go ahead . Leave me . It 's not like I 'll be around much longer anyhow . Relax . I 'm gonna go help Wyatt . Yeah . Where the hell is he ? He 's building a giant battery to power my magic . The potatoes are washed , the chicken wire 's ready , and all we need is a wash basin and I 'm back online . Great . So the future of my entire family depends on something Wyatt saw once on " Beakman 's World . " I suppose I- - I should have told you , I- - I tune with my left , but I shoot with my right . Hoo ! You 're my hero ! Ha ! Well , Red Brick 's resting up his gun hand for the big showdown . Whoa . So how 's the fryolater coming ? Did you know you can make electricity from an ordinary potato ? It 's true . Science can be fun if you just take the time . Lissie and I have harnessed the power of electricity . Just in time to save Red . Red 's not gonna be needing any magic . The way he 's shooting , those dorks will be begging for mercy . I find that hard to believe . Believe it . He 's a Wallace . We know how to kick butt . I hope he 's right . Spittoon Maker Eats Lead , Pushes Daisies . We 're gonna need more potatoes . You sure this will work ? I 've rewired the output to electrify that chicken wire grid . Soon as the Devil 's Hand Gang step on it , zappo . Frontier stun gun . What time have you got ? Ate . It 's noon . Excuse me . High noon . Come on , Red ! Unless you 're yellow ! Get it , boys ? Red ? Yellow ? Hm ? Oh , to hell with it . Let 's just shoot him . I guess this is it . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Hey . Hold it , y 'all . Hold on . Stop this right now . What do you people think you 're doing ? I can 't believe you were gonna start without me . Good luck to both of you . OK . You can kill him now . Look at them . They 're shaking in their boots . You 're gonna plug them so full of lead , they 'll wish they never tangled with a Wallace . What are you doing ? This ain 't right . Shooting people never solved anything . I mean , what are we even fighting about ? Honor . Respect . Law . They 're running over this town . Somebody 's gotta stand up to them . You 're right . That 's just what I 'm gonna do . Wyatt . Wait . Red 's coming this way . What ? What 's he doing ? He 's gonna step on the grid . Turn it off . I can 't . I installed an electrostatic charge capacitor . What are you talking about ? The zucchini ! This is a showdown , Red ! Technically , I think you 're supposed to start up the other end of the street . Yeah , I know . But I wanted to tell you to your face . I- - I apologize for swatting you yesterday , Snake . I got no quarrel with you or your boys . And gun play never solved anything . Apology accepted . Put away your guns , boys . Ain 't we gonna shoot him , Snake ? Nope . We 're gonna kill him with our bare hands . Red . A bit of advice . Run . I can 't . A Wallace never backed down from a fight . Since when ? [ SPARKING ] Oh no . He 's toast . Look ! Nothing 's happening . It 's the sneakers ! He 's insulated ! Come on , boys . Let 's finish him off ! [ APPLAUSE ] One punch ! Pal , you knocked them out cold , you stud ! Aren 't you excited ? I do feel a bit tingly at that ! Golly , Red . I guess I was wrong about you . You 're the real authority in this town . Ha ha ha ! You , sheriff ? What am I , loco ? MAN : Get him ! WOMAN : Come on ! String him up ! Let 's get him ! I 'm the sheriff ! I 'm proud to know you , Red Brick Wallace . Power of righteousness was surging through my loins and into my fist . Hey . What 's the rush ? I wanna stick around for the post-showdown shindig . We gotta stay . It 's at the brothel . We don 't have time . I think we might have enough juice for Lisa to zap us home , but we gotta hurry . The radishes could blow any second . You don 't wanna know . [ CLICK ] WYATT : Oh no . Not so fast , tater boy . Time for you to get hitched . Oh , yeah . I 'm getting married . Lis , what are we gonna do ? We 're trapped . What do you mean we ? So , were you thinking sit down reception , or buffet ? Oh , pappy . You always scare them away . [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different , we 're making weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ?

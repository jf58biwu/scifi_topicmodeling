 Secure . How about them Dodgers ? Secure . Secure . Bitch . Wait ! Don 't leave without me ! Wait . All aboard ! What are you waiting for ? Come on ! No ! No ! What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Sliders . Oh , man ! I just got these shoes ! You need to use rubber soles . Better grip . What a ride ! I haven 't felt a rush like that since my first night carrier landing . You 'd think you 'd be used to it by now . Where were you ? Look , we request you be at the gate 10 minutes before departure . I don 't ever want you to cut it that close again ! Horses ! That 's right , girl . They 're horses . Hey , baby . Hey . Come here . Did you get into that sliding lab ? Can we go riding ? I haven 't been since I was a kid . Let 's see what this world is like , huh ? Come on , guys . I 'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt , Captain Beckett . You were outside the wire to steal a smoke ? Walk the dog ? Ordered a pizza ? Eloping ? Your behavior couldn 't have had anything to do with the break-in tonight . Actually , it did . I noticed some intruders on the base . Three men and a woman . They were breaking into the lab . I tried to stop them . Yes . A guard was assaulted near the Quantum Translocation Lab . Is he all right ? Took a nasty blow to the head . Remembers being jumped , not much else . I don 't need to remind you that with the Soviets on the rise again we are on heightened alert . I 've just received word that the joint chiefs have rescinded the uniform code of military justice . Suspected spies may now be shot at my discretion . Good , ma 'am . See the captain to her quarters . What happened after we got split up ? Did you make it into the lab ? Lab ? The lab ? Remember ? We risked our necks and almost lost you trying to get into their sliding lab . Easy , chief . Yeah , I made it into the lab . They 're doing research on sliding . They call it " Quantum Translocation . " But they 're not having much luck . Nothing that could help us get to the home world ? They 're sliding chickens and baboons . Well , this place looks like it hasn 't even hit the chicken and baboon stage . I think it 's wonderful ! It 's simple . And , gosh , look at all the stars ! No city lights . Yeah , well , give me Times Square any day . Lock down ! Maybe there 's a curfew . No ! Please ! I didn 't do anything ! And someone 's breaking it . Please ! I didn 't do anything . I have a wife ! I have a family ! No ! Over there . Move ! Trick or treat ? This looks like a lively place . Come on . Did you see it ? Hurry up ! You know the word . And the word is law . Tech , which has brought woe and ruination upon us must be banished from our midst . Must be banished . This man possesses the tech . I just found that . Please . I don 't even know what it is . It is tech , and those who possess it must be punished . According to the laws of El Diablo . El Diablo . No ! Please . No ! Good God . I don 't even want to know what 's behind door number two . Aren 't you gonna walk me ? Hey , Beckett . I hear Colonel Burke tore you a new one . Nah . She just wanted my expert advice on base security . Sure she did . I 'm just glad they didn 't give you the old . 45 caliber retirement party . 'Cause I am too old to be breaking in a new pilot . The MPs walked me home . I was surprised they didn 't want to tuck me in . Those meat-boys never come in here . You know that . We give them the willies . Anyway , I 'm glad you 're back . We should link into the air combat matrix , fly some neuro-sims for the flight profile for tomorrow . Not right now . I 'm beat . Besides , we 've got it wired , right ? How long we 've been flying , Siskin ? Together , you and me ? Three years . Turning and burning . Three years . Wow . Wouldn 't you rather be home ? Oh , no . Not again . Are you in one of your introspective moods ? Just humor me , okay ? How do you put up with this ? I don 't know . King and country . Keeping the red menace at bay . All that crap . Same as you . It takes a special breed to keep America safe now . Right ? They got that right . You still believe it ? What choice do I have ? Retire ? After what they 've done to me ? I mean , we make our choices . We gotta live with them . Good night , Siskin . These people built a whole religion based on their fear of technology . El Diablo . The devil . What happened to that man ? I don 't know . But that was a radiation symbol on that door . Is there any danger ? I really don 't want to stick around to find out . Yeah . Well , we 've got 32 hours here . You better put that away . Keep it out of sight . Yeah . You 're right . Wouldn 't want to tick off ol ' El Diablo . Hey , they 've got a band . And there was no cover charge . Come on , Q-Ball . Let 's dance . I don 't dance . Oh , come on , don 't be shy . Let 's boogie ! I 'm just not very good . It 's not about being good , baby . It 's about being fearless . Come on ! Hmm . And you said you couldn 't dance . I guess it 's all those physics club mixers . I can 't remember when I felt so good . It 's kind of a rancid place to get excited about , don 't you think ? It 's not about what this place is . It 's about what it isn 't . It isn 't the last world . Everything about that world is gone . In this universe , it never even existed . Every slide is a fresh start . Isn 't that what sliding 's all about , huh ? Never knowing which world you 'll wake up in next , or who you 'll wake up with ? That 's one way to look at it . It 's a life full of possibilities . And you 're the constant . What 's the matter ? Are you all right ? You all right ? Please tell me you guys put some of that defense budget into sliding research . What are you doing here ? Sleep-walking ? Maggie ? Steven . Steven . You 're alive . Of course I 'm alive . Why ? Did you put something in my coffee ? What ? Colonel Burke said you were confined to quarters . What are you doing here , Maggie ? I just wanted to see you . Why ? Look at you . Burke said you were acting strange . I 'll schedule a diagnostic on your neural implants . No , everything 's fine . I just ... I had a dream . About us ... About the last time we went skiing . We haven 't skied since you joined the EPP . We haven 't done anything together since you were enhanced . The government can 't risk having one of its expensive pilots damaged , now , can they ? What are you doing here , Maggie ? We used to be close . What ? You mean like husband and wife ? Yes . What is this ? Some kind of a joke ? You haven 't wanted to look at me for the last two years . I just thought we could talk . About what ? About how you 'll never forgive me for what I did to you ? About how I turned you into a freak ? Steven . You were the one who wanted to be changed , who wanted to fly the hottest planes . You could have resigned your commission . We could have started a family like we talked about . But no , you had to keep on flying . It takes a new breed to go toe-to-toe with Ivan . Rah-rah . You didn 't want that . What are you trying to do ? Get me shot ? I 'm as dedicated to the war effort as anyone . I did what needed to be done . But you were my wife , Maggie . I still am . No . Now you 're some kind of a machine . You want to talk ? Go jack in . Talk to your plane . What do you think this is ? It 's blue . I 'll take two . Thank you . Feeling better ? Oh , sure . Nothing to worry about . You get spit out of a wormhole , you swallow a couple of tankards of the local grog , put it in your stomach , and look out ! How come you and I never got together ? Oh , gosh . I don 't know . Between fighting Kromaggs , trying to find my home world ... I guess there really isn 't that much time for dating . But you 've thought about it . Right ? Maggie . We 're good friends . We could be more . There are other things to consider . Rembrandt and Colin ? We 're the leaders , Quinn . It 's right that we 're together . Maggie , we 're a team . We might not always be . Think about our life . Sliding from world to world . Who do we have besides each other ? Do you want your life to be a series of one-world-stands ? Am I interrupting something ? Just checking out the local produce . Mmm . Juicy . Colin , I thought you were gonna teach me to ride today . Of course , if the liverymen are still amenable . We 'll make them amenable . Bye , guys . Is she okay ? I don 't know . I 've just never seen her acting like she did last night . What do you mean , happy ? I don 't have anything against her dancing . It 's just she 's never been one to call attention to herself , you know ? I mean , especially on worlds where they put you into a radioactive pit for owning a TV . We 've been to a lot of alternate worlds , Remmy . You gotta remember , she lost the only one she had . And her husband along with it . Maybe she 's starting to heal a little . You gonna be the one to take that from her ? Don 't cross any wires , boys . You 'll void my warranty . We 're online . Circuit interface is green . Proceed with the test . Begin simulation . Roger . We 're cooking with gas now , Jackson ! Status ? Still green . Neural response time is being augmented by 140 % . 180 % . 200 % neural capacity . Hey , Steven . What 's wrong with him ? Siskin ? Siskin ! The chip 's overloading his nervous system . His neural response is off the scale . It 's killing him ! Abort ! Help me . Please ! Abort ! Help me ! Somebody help me ! Come on ! Get a medic ! Go on ! That was unbelievable ! You are a natural . Just to ride and ride , and no one to tell you where to go , or what the mission parameters are . We could have kept going and no one would have ever known . We would have lost our deposit . Hey , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm just a little woozy . Guess I haven 't gotten my land legs back yet . Maybe we should find a doctor ? No ! What would they do ? Bleed me with leeches ? No . I 'm just going back to the inn to lie down . Okay ? I 'll be fine . Who the devil are you ? What are you talking about ? It 's me , Rem . Yeah ? Last time I looked , our Maggie didn 't have a computer chip in the back of her head . Now you gotta be a double and not from this world . You slid with us . Right ? Yes . Where is she ? I couldn 't stay there . They were killing me . Where is she ? Look . Look what they did to me . We 'll do whatever we can for you . But we are going back to get our Maggie . Thank you . But I 'm not going back ! Never . This man is a heretic . He has technology . What ? He has a device . A forbidden device . I 'll show you . See ? Technology . He 's tried bewitching me with it . It is tech . You know the word ! And the word is the law . What went wrong ? We 're not sure . The flight control unit was completely shorted out . You mean the pilot . You seem pretty shaken up about this . You don 't . This wasn 't just a piece of hardware you thrashed today , some sparkplug you can just replace . It was a man ! That 's his bunk you 're sitting on . He had a wife and kids before you turned him into some flying freak show . He made his choice . Just like you . Yeah . If I was the " flight control unit " whose brain you 'd fried , how would you feel , huh ? Why are you doing this ? You 've already made yourself dead to me , Maggie . Now you want me to care ? You want to know how I 'd feel if this was you ? Relieved . At least then I wouldn 't lie awake every night wondering why you picked this over me . I don 't care about the Russians anymore . About the arms race . About fighting the good fight . Why do you think I set up the Quantum Translocation Lab ? I figured there had to be a world out there that wouldn 't do this to us . Maybe there is . You told me I was dead to you . Well , this is hard to explain , but ... For a long time now I thought you were dead , too . And when I saw you in the office ... You can 't believe how I felt . Captain Beckett . What is it , Colonel ? Captain Beckett has been reassigned . To where ? After our little snafu today , we 've decided to proceed with the next phase of the program . Is that wise ? Dr. Jensen , you seem to be a long way from your lab . Do you need an escort to show you the way there ? Captain Beckett , this way . And he didn 't tell you where he was going ? When Colin and I got back from riding he was gone . Okay . Okay . We 've been through this before . We slide in two hours . We 're just gonna have to spread out and search for him . Quinn , there 's something you 're not considering . What if he doesn 't want to be found ? What ? He was telling me things this morning . What kind of things ? Well , I didn 't tell you because I figured it was just Remmy blowing off steam . You know how he can be . What did he say ? He was talking about leaving . Splitting up . Oh , this is crazy . Is it ? Maybe he 's just tired of sliding . What if he 's right ? Do we want to waste our lives running when we could have something right here ? Remmy 's been arrested . What for ? They found the timer on him . They don 't know what it is , but they know it 's tech . He 's being charged with heresy against El Diablo . The judgment by fire is tonight . Okay . Let 's go . No ! No ! If we let them know we 're with him , they 'll condemn us , too . They 'll kill us all . Is that what you want ? Maggie . We can stay here . We don 't have to slide anymore , Quinn . We 'll stay here . You and me . Maggie . Maggie ? Let 's go . She 's not our Maggie . I could be . Where is she ? On my world . I 'm stationed at the base that you broke into . When I saw your Maggie , I thought that was my chance to get away . I jumped her from behind . I changed clothes with her and I followed you through the vortex . Why come with us ? Why couldn 't you just leave ? Quit ? You can 't just quit when you 're classified " top-secret . " That would be compromising national security . Besides , there 's nowhere I could go where they couldn 't track me down . Except another universe . What 'd they do to you ? I did it to myself . The cold war got hot . We built planes so advanced no human could fly them . Pilots needed to be enhanced . Neural implants . Adrenal stimulants . You name it , I got it . Only way to stay on top . In the air , I 'm an ace . On the ground I 'm a circus freak . What 's happening to you ? There 's not enough room up here for all the bells and whistles , so some of it had to come out . My implant links my brain directly with the flight-control computers . The computers take over whatever functions my brain has lost . And without the link , my brain forgets to tell my body how to function . You knew you were gonna die and you still came with us ? I stole a chip from the lab . It was supposed to allow my implant to function independently from the network . But I guess it still has a few bugs in it . We 've got to get you back . I 'd rather die here . I already told him that . Remmy found out about you . He was going to tell us , so you turned him in to the local inquisition . I didn 't know what else to do . You could have come to us for help . We would have given it . Now if you know anything about our Maggie , you should know that she has terrific taste in friends . I 'm sorry . Accepted . But now you 're gonna help us get Remmy back . Or you 're gonna die here . My God . What are they ? Don 't you mean , " Who are they ? " This is Lieutenant Fairchild . Major Dutton . And I believe you met Major Franks at the base Halloween party last year . He was dressed as Eleanor Roosevelt . What have you done to them ? By altering their genetic patterns , we have created the perfect pilot . No fear . No emotion , no mind . Just a finely tuned organic flight computer suspended in a shockproof solution , capable of pulling up to 20 Gs . Meet your new squadron , Captain . I 'm sure you 'll enjoy flying together . Remember , it takes a special breed to keep America safe . You know the word . And the word is law . " Any variation from prescribed DOE " andlor corporate operating procedures " is punishable " upon appeal and review " by immediate suspension " andlor " termination . " Termination . You 're crazy ! Fools ! Don 't you know who this is ? No . And the same may be said of you . This is Rem ... Rem ... Remilio , mighty wizard in league with El Diablo . And with this devilish device that gloweth so wickedly and devilishly ... Indeed . All the more reason to burn him ! Yeah ! Burn him ! Burn him ! No ! No ! Technology is just a tool . Neither good , nor evil . It depends on how you use it . Like the butter churn . It can produce the sweet buttery goodness , or it can produce the sour milk of funkiness . The hell with this . My name is Quinn-tar . And now I will destroy you all ! You people should really check out the library . There are a lot better books than this ! Let 's go . Stop them ! Stop them ! Stay back ! Stay back ! Stay back ! Are you all right ? Please ! Please , don 't take me back there ! Get her outta here ! Go ! Stay back ! Stay back ! That was a rescue plan ? " You churneth the buttery goodness " ? I don 't have writers , you know . Quinn . Don 't worry . We 're gonna get you some help . No . You don 't know what they 'll do to me . Just let me die . I 'm sorry . I can 't do that . You remind us too much of someone we know . Could I have a moment ? Did you know about this ? What they were doing here ? Look at those things over there . They used to be men . And now they 're turning me into one of them . Are you just gonna let this happen ? It 's too late . Burke will have us both shot . Steven , do you remember what I told you ? About you being dead to me ? And about how when I saw you in the lab , I thought maybe we had a chance to start over ? Yes . Well , I wasn 't speaking metaphorically . My husband is dead . My Steven Jensen is dead . Maggie , please . He was paralyzed in a skiing accident on a vacation that you never took . I gave up my flight status to be with him . But he was murdered before I slid off my world . Maggie , I ... What ? You slid ? I 'm from an alternate universe . I slid into this world with three of my friends . But now I 'm trapped here . But that technology doesn 't exist . Not here . Not now . But you know that it can , Steven . When I saw you in that lab I knew you weren 't my Steven , but you were still the same man on this world . It was crazy , but I thought to myself that for a while we could be together again . There is something different about you . But it 's impossible . It 's just a theory . We don 't even have any proof that alternate worlds exist . You do now . Look . Do you see any neural implants ? Do you ? How is that possible ? Because I 'm not your Maggie and you 're not my Steven . But the Steven I knew would never let this happen . Well , that is quite an interesting story . I was wondering how your neural implants were removed , but I didn 't think you 'd come up with such a fanciful explanation . How else do you explain it ? Quite simply . She 's a traitor . Any number of subversive Luddite groups would consider it a propaganda coup to turn one of our enhanced pilots , remove her neural network in a secret operation and then trot her out to denounce the military on some bleeding-heart liberal news outlet . Oh , by the way , the guard that was attacked during last night 's security breach is starting to get his memory back . He says that you attacked him in the men 's room . That 's crazy . I 'm crazy ? I 'm not claiming I just popped in from some parallel universe . Jensen , don 't you see what she 's doing ? She 's playing you . She 's telling you what you want to hear . What ? She 's your duplicate lover from another dimension ? Something to satisfy your libido and scientific curiosity at the same time ? I 'm telling the truth . Well , the simplest solution would be to have you shot . But we 're not immune to a little propaganda ourselves . We 're going to turn our would-be traitor into one of our new breed of pilots . And fortunately , the transformation will rid you of any seditious urges . The first stage of DNA treatment will begin in an hour . We 've got to get her some help . How do we get in ? Here . Secure . Secure . What now ? Bitch . Open the panel . Come on . What are you doing ? I 'm sending e-mail . We 'll get in somehow . Steven . Maggie . Dr. Jensen , I presume . I just couldn 't take it anymore . I know , Maggie . I 'm so sorry . It was true . Maggie , the other Maggie , told me that she 'd slid here . But I don 't know that I really believed it until now . Come on . What 's going on ? Her body 's rejecting the genetic reconfiguration . Increase the neural stimulation by 200 milliamps . Give me 50 cc 's of chromosol . Come on , come on , come on . Go to 300 milliamps . Come on . 400 . Shut it down . What happened ? I don 't know . For some reason her DNA didn 't match the profiles . Her body rejected the new genome imprints . Perform the autopsy right away . I don 't want the program held up . Sorry , Jensen . If it 's any consolation , we 'll give her a hero 's funeral . Who 's next on the flight roster ? I don 't know . Go to 500 milliamps . How ? Come on . Come on ! Steven , you brought me back . Not quite all the way . I 'm going to get you out of here . I 'm gonna take this machinery out of you . We 're going to start over . I 'm sorry about leaving you here . I guess I would have done anything just to be able to get away . Forget it . I 'm just glad I had a chance to meet your Steven . Is he anything like yours ? Pretty close . Only difference ... I never had a chance to say goodbye to mine . Goodbye . Goodbye , Steven . Are you gonna be able to get out of here ? Yeah . I perform the autopsies around here . Hey , thanks for the vacation , Quinn-tar . Any time . Quinn-tar ? A little pet name . Hmm . It 's time . All right . Let 's do it .

Rescue crews are responding at the site of the accident ... Oh , God . - What are you doing here ? - I got a call . Said Public Works lost seven guys . What 's going on ?

Maybe the earthquake tore something up . - Oh , shit . - Let 's find out before we ... You 're not happy unless you 're declaring an emergency , are you ? No , actually I enjoy motor sports , music and the company of close friends , sir . 30,000 people think they 're taking the train home tonight . What am I supposed to do for them ? Put on extra buses . It 's his mess . Let him take the shit for it . We arrived at the scene of this tragic accident .

I 'm slightly busy right now . I think that 's the issue he wants to discuss with you . Sindelar : What the hell 's he doing ? Public Works is sending a crew in . Those guys are idiots . He knows that . Mike felt this was too time sensitive to wait , sir . Tell him we 've got procedures here . Tell him he 's not in Kansas anymore . You 're not in Kansas anymore , Mike . St. Louis . I 'm not in St. Louis . St. Louis . He 's not in St. Louis . I don 't give a shit where he 's not . He has a desk now . That 's where he works . He doesn 't give a shit .

Big jet of gas coming up out of the bottom of that tube . I don 't know what it is . Sparks hot as hell . - He ain 't lying , Emmit . - And find me a scientist . A geologist . Somebody who can tell me what the hell is going on . Got it . Guide : Situated on Wilshire Boulevard 's famous Museum Row the La Brea Tar Pits are one of the LA Basin 's most active geological features . Here for the past 40,000 years , a deep fissure in the Earth 's crust has allowed oily tar and methane to bubble up to the surface from far underground , evidence of the ceaseless activity below our very feet . The 22-story Beverly Heights apartment building will open on schedule this week in spite of construction delays . That 's the word from developer Norman Calder . Many see the new landmark tower across from the Beverly Center as a sign the LA economy is on the rebound . Now here 's Jere Laird with the rest of the business news . Wow . So ? I think I married a genius . Three years , four banks , $ 100 million ... the doors are open . Jaye : I am so proud of you , honey . You never gave up . You didn 't let me . Here 's how I see our future . We move into this penthouse and then you transfer to Cedars , which is right down the block . Norman . I don 't want my wife treating gunshot wounds . I want her treating tennis elbows . Right . Finished ? Hardly . This is only the beginning . I can 't believe he got a babysitter . Yeah , well , I 'm doing him a favor . A big favor . I 'm gonna miss my class . Hello ? Mike . Oh , fine . A perfect little ray of sunshine like I was after my parents separated . Every couple of minutes , her head comes off her shoulders and rotates 360 degrees and then she starts watching TV again . It 's been hours . Well , we 've got a bit of a situation here , honey . I 'll come home as soon as I can . But tomorrow we get to go to OJ 's house and then the Beverly Center , right ? I thought we talked about Disneyland . Dad , we talked about getting my nose pierced . - Not in this life , baby . - Ahem . I 'll be home as soon as I can . Hi , what can I do for you ? I 'm getting my nose pierced . It 's a nice look . Especially when you sneeze . You can 't do this . What ? You 're talking about 10,000 customers with no cooking and no heat . The gas will be restored as soon as it 's safe , all right ? When is that gonna be ? You 're talking about sending a crew to every single house to turn on every damn pilot . This could take weeks if not more . Excuse me . Just one second , please . - Having fun yet ? - I 'm starting to miss the Mississippi . The mud , floods , your buds . Mike , you have a call on your private line . That 'll be my little girl wanting a tattoo . Would you help me with this guy ? How you doing , darling ? Why the hell did you leave Kelly alone ? - Oh , Wendy . How are you ? - Pulling one of your usual stunts . What do you mean , one of my usual stunts ? - It was an earthquake , Wendy . - You know she hates earthquakes . - She 's only 13 . - Nobody likes an earthquake ! - So she 's been alone all day . - She has not been alone all day . I left her with a babysitter . - What babysitter ? - A neighbor . How is she supposed to know what to do if there 's another earthquake ? You know she freezes up when she gets scared . Kelly knows precisely what to do in the event of ... - You never change , Mike . - Hello ? Hello ? Phone went dead . Yeah . They 've been doing that all over the city . I 'll get a crew out there right away . Amy : I know . I 've got it . Why don 't we just do some more underground blasting and find out if there 's a fault line down there ? - No , let 's do it your way . - My way ? We 'll empty every building over two stories and we 'll all go back to horse and buggy . How 's that ? - God , you 're a geek . - Mike . Emmit . Did you know that ? You 're a geek . Nice shirt , Stan . - You Roark ? Amy Barnes . - Yeah . Hi . I 'm from CIGS . Nice to meet you . Careful , Mike . Disagree with anything Dr. Barnes says , she 'll have you in city council meetings for 12 months . Would you please give it a rest ? All we said was Cahuenga was geologically unstable . The whole city is geologically unstable . That 's why I don 't want you blowing up tunnels under it . Thank you for coming on short notice . But could you save the fight for later ? Yeah , sure . 2 : 00 good for you ? Oh , go ahead . Encourage her . So , Dr. Barnes , can you tell me what 's underneath MacArthur Park ? Not with any certainty , no . Ooh , that 's a shock . We ran trains through there all day and no incidents . Yes , but this rock solid analysis is from the guys who collapsed Hollywood Boulevard . My engineers were down there . No demonstrable risk . You got some conflicting evidence ? Some reason to strand all those passengers ? I 'm all ears . Until then , we stay on schedule . - Stan , you got a second ? - I 'm sorry , Mike . He 's got to change his nicotine patch . - So ... - So ... So ... how do I find out what 's underneath MacArthur Park ? A low-grade evacuation of MacArthur Park . City officials won 't comment whether this evacuation has anything to do with the deaths today of those seven public workers at an intersection next to the park . - Take a look at this . - Oh , okay . What am I looking at ? That lake was 62 degrees yesterday . - Today it 's up to 68 . - It is a sunny day . It is lovely , isn 't it ? Mr. Roark , it takes a geological event to heat a million gallons of water by six degrees in 12 hours . What is a geological event ? I 'm sure you 're aware of this , that our continents sit on tectonic plates . Great big rafts floating over an ocean of molten rock . Yeah . When they shift like they did this morning , we get an earthquake , okay ? Yeah . Same mechanism can sometimes open a fissure . Sometimes magma can find one of those fissures and rise up through it . - What 's magma ? - Lava . Lava ? Here in LA ? It 's one of several possibilities . It is unlikely , but it is a possibility . We have a history of that here in the downtown area ? Paricutin , 1943 . A Mexican farmer sees smoke coming out of the middle of his cornfield . A week later there 's a volcano 1,000 feet high . There 's no history of anything until it happens . Then there is . Well , thanks , ladies . Enjoy your day in the park . - Ooh , yeah . That was subtle . - What ? What , you want me to humor him ? He asked us for a hypothesis . You have a better one ? - It 's lava . - Lava . Hey , hey , hey . That 's me . That 's me . I got to call my mom . - Uh-huh . - I 'm on TV . Excuse me . You invited us , remember ? You want me to call Olber and tell him the demonstrative risk he 's looking for is lava ? No . I want you to give me time to do my work . Why , ' cause the lake went up a few degrees ? No , because seven men baked to death down there and nobody knows why . All right , MTA does not answer to the city . You know that . I cannot go to the mat with them unless you know something . I do know something . Just not with any certainty . Is that the company line ? I 'm a scientist . Certainty is a big word . Come on , I have to have time to collect my data . I 've got to get down there and get samples . - I can 't let you do that . - Why not ? It is too dangerous . That 's why . I 'm sorry . Shit . What did he say ? Oh , it 's too dangerous . It 's man 's work and you 're just little girlies . - I can 't let you go down there . - He likes you , I can tell . He 's okay , in a macho , controlling , slightly superior , suspicious of anyone who 's not from his hometown kind of way . So you like him . This is good . We 've got to go down there . I don 't see how we can . This place is swarming with cops . Yeah . Let 's do it in the morning before the cops come on duty . All right . I 'll pick you up at 4 : 00 . 4 : 00 it is . Bring coffee . - Okay . - What have you got ? More harmonic tremors . Good morning . It 's just after 5 : 10 . Didn 't take long to get our first Sig Alert this morning . We 've got a jackknifed produce truck on the westbound side of the 10 spreading tomatoes all over the roadway . One lane open as Caltrans crews move in . Wow . Earthlings , we come in peace . God , these suits weigh a ton . I feel like I 'm wearing a car . Hey , look at this . Looks like sulfur . I can 't smell it . - It 's everywhere . - Oh , shit . My flashlight 's going out . May be traces of magnesium , nickel . - What do you think ? - Take some samples . That 's how we 'll find out . My battery 's dead . Hold on a sec . Hey . What ? What do you got ? I don 't know . Kelly : Daddy ! Kelly , baby . Coming . - Hang on . - Dad ! Hang on , baby . No , come back . Come back . Stay right there in that door , baby . Get down ! Rachel ! Rachel ! Help ! Oh , God ! - Amy ! Amy ! - Hang on . Rachel ! Give me your hand ! - Oh , God . Come on . - Oh , God ! Come on ! Come on , Rachel ! - I 'm burning up ! - Hang on . - I 'm burning up ! - Take my hand ! - I 'm burning ! - Hold on , Rachel ! Oh ! How about that wake-up call , everybody ? Okay , we have phone lines . Phone lines are up . All right , generator switching . All right , emergency power 's up . What do you got , Phil ? Katie , DWP ? DWP , I 'm doing that right now . - Billy ? Anybody seen Billy ? - He 's stuck on the 10 . He 's not in yet . All right , listen up , people . I want to have a meeting of all department heads in Roark 's office in exactly five minutes . That 's a very cool hat there , Emmit . Oh , thanks a lot . You know , that 's funny ' cause your wife rolled over and she said the same thing to me this morning . That 's a pink slip . Any more quips or can we work this thing ? Like all of you , we here at the Channel 10 newsroom felt that big jolt this morning . It was a powerful earthquake . We 're having trouble getting through to the police , fire , and other emergency officials . Put your seat belt on , honey . Remember ? That 's okay , baby . There you go . I want to go home . We 're going to the safest room in town , baby , I promise . - Operations . - Yes , this is Roark . - Got Roark , line one . - Yeah , got him . Mike , listen , there 's no reports of damage yet to any of the hospitals , but 911 is off the hook . ADSAC is reporting that all the freeways are clear . Okay , we got some good news here .

I 'm heading east on Wilshire . We 're coming up on the tar pits . The poles are all up , but there 's no light . A lot of haze here . - Let me in there , Brian . - Okay , hold on one second . We have to get to that break . Yeah , it looks like the power 's down everywhere in the city . - How 'd you get in so fast ? - Get in ? Come on , boss , you know I sleep on your desk . Disaster is my life . He 's kidding , baby . Woman on radio : Obviously it 's too early to get any kind of a reading from the scientists at the California Institute of Geological Studies ... Dad ! Hold it , hold it . What was that ? Is that something on your end , Mike ? Mike , come in . What 's going on ? Daddy , what is this ? I don 't know , baby . Mike , come on . - We 're gonna die . - No , we 're not . I 'm gonna need both hands , sweetheart . Emmit , what 's the nearest fire station - for Wilshire and Stanley ? - Dad ! What are you looking at , Mike ? Mike ? Mike , come in . What 's going on ? Fire , heavy , on the ground and structural . And there 's immense conical smoke coming up out of the tar pits . And something like meteors coming up out of the smoke . Sounds like you said something like a meteor . Look out ! Or something like bombs . Emmit , get ahold of that geologist Amy Barnes right away . - You have Amy Barnes , Katie ? - Well , check him again . No , I 'm swamped . We 're looking all over for her , Mike . Nobody knows where she is . - Okay in here ? - Still shaking , man . Everybody all right ? God damn it ! Where are we ? Power failures on all the lines . - Contact with the trains ? - All but one . I think we 've got a problem . Number four train westbound on the Red Line outside MacArthur Park . Temperature on board reached 20 degrees above normal . And it 's still going up . What do you want to do , Stan ? I 'm going down there . Get a team together . What happened ? Everybody okay in here ? How you doing ? What 's happening ? I 'm fine . I think we had an earthquake . - Earthquake ? - Yeah , are you okay ? - What 's causing all that heat ? - I don 't know , sir . Hey , I 'll help you . No , no , please . Stay where you are . - Nobody move . - Why is it so hot in here ? I 'm gonna try and open one of these doors for you . Woman : I can 't breathe . The power outage is pretty widespread . A number of fires are breaking out ... Refinery info 's coming in . I got Marty on that . Hyperion 's got no damage . We 're still waiting on Tillman Reclamation . - They 're not calling . - Okay , look , call DWP . - Stay on it . Yes , Chief ? - Roark ? - No , this is Reese , sir . - Where 's Roark ? - He 's on his way . - I 'm gonna be delayed . My damn car 's stuck behind my damn gate because we have no damn power ! Yeah , I got it . No damn power . Very good . Reese out . Jerk . Lisa , get me a bottle and a half of aspirin . Our staff is caught in traffic and we will ... mainly due to the quake . Man on radio : This is KNX 1070 continuing our live coverage of this morning 's quake . A situation is developing in the Wilshire District . Our Bob Davis is there now reporting from his car phone . Bob ? Mitch , I 'm approaching the scene now . There 's some kind of ash falling everywhere . Almost looks like a gray snow . Several buildings are burning out of control at this hour . It began a few minutes right after the quake started by an undetermined source . There was an explosion , lots of breaking windows and then flames . Bob , are we talking about a ruptured gas line ? Mike : All right , calm down , everybody . The fire department 's on its way . Put some pressure on that . Emmit ! We 've got a mess here . Can you hear me ? I need a traffic perimeter for three blocks in every direction around Wilshire and Stanley . Okay , Wilshire and Stanley . I 'm on it , Mike . 17 is down . 17 's engine is down .

Don 't move , sweetheart . You 'll be safe here . - You 're leaving me here ? - No , I 'm just going over there . I 'll be right back . You 'll be able to see me the whole time . If you get scared you honk that horn , okay ? Mitch , I 've arrived at the park . I 'm there now . Get out of here ! Don 't touch that man . Watch out ! Don 't touch that man , ma 'am . The ambulances are on the way . I 'm a doctor . This man has a skull fracture . This other man has a compound fracture in his left leg . Can you get him off the street and keep him warm ? And find out if there 's anything in the fire truck that we can use as a splint . There are firefighters out in the street . There 's a man inside the truck . Help ! Help ! Get me out of here . Help ! Help ! It 's getting harder and harder to hear anything right now . The roar is constant . It 's very loud here . I can barely even hear myself think . There are geysers of steam going up right out of manholes . All I hear right now is just this roaring sound . It 's roaring . Oh , my God . Mitch ... Mitch , I don 't know how to describe this , but the tar ... the tar pits themselves are on fire and they 're right now spilling out onto Wilshire Boulevard . It 's coming right up out of the ground itself . It 's as if the tar caught fire , melted , and somehow expanded . The downed fire truck is still on its side . Injured firefighters are desperately in need of medical help . Rescue personnel are starting to arrive . I know this sounds crazy , but it almost looks like lava ... volcanic lava pouring onto the street . Dad ! Kelly . Dad , hurry ! My leg is burning ! It hurts ! - It hurts . - Stay calm .

We 've got to get more units here . Watch out for his leg . This girl has a burn on her leg . Can you help her , too ? I have to get these men to a hospital . I 'm going to take them to Cedars . - You want me to take her , too ? - Dad ! Get down ! Get down ! Don 't worry about it . You 're gonna be okay . Stay calm . Give me that telephone . Mitch , that was a large catering truck and now it 's just a huge , huge ball of fire . It 's a fireball burning out of control . Emmit , we 're at level one here . I want you to have the CHP close all the off-ramps on the I-10 at La Brea , La Cienega , Fairfax , and bump that traffic perimeter to 10 blocks - away from the La Brea Tar Pits . - I got that , Mike . What is it ... Emmit , I will give you details later , just get it done . Get some hoses on those trees up there , fellas . Turn the traffic around on Wilshire right now . Back up . Get out of here . - You 're OEM , right ? - Yeah . You need to be here , she doesn 't . - She 's my daughter . - Yes . This is a second-degree burn . - I 'll take her to Cedars . - Ow ! It 'll be fine , but it could get infected if we don 't deal with it . Here 's my name and my pager number . This is no place for her . You know it . Dad , we 're going home , right ? No , sweetheart , this is not a safe place for you to be . We 've got to get that leg taken care of right now . - But I want to stay with you . - She got any medical allergies ? No . This lady 's name is Dr. Jaye Calder , honey . She 's a doctor . She 's gonna help you . Watch your feet there , baby . I want you to go with her . I 'll talk to you by telephone as soon as you get to the hospital . All right , there 's my card . Please , please . You can 't just leave me . Honey , you cannot be here and I have to stay . - Why ? - Because it 's my responsibility . So am I. Please , I promise I won 't get in the way . Just go . Go ! - Go . - Dad ! Dad ! Hey , I need a radio . I really need it . You guys have your radios ... As you can see , we 've got a lot of confused people below us running in every direction , obviously terrified . This man is ... well , I can 't even guess where he 's running . - Ladies and gentlemen ... - No , I don 't think so , Chief . I mean , why would Mike be running around down there ? - That 's Mike Roark . - Shut up . What ? No . Look , I just talked to Mike , okay ? He was in the car . Yeah , and besides , this guy 's a lot taller . Look , Chief , I 'm kind of swamped right now . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd let me call you back . - Yes , all right . Reese out . - What the hell is that ? Marty , I 'm looking at the same damn thing you are . You guys seeing this shit ? What can only be described as lava is now snaking its way down Stanley Avenue just off Wilshire . Jim , this is Stanley Avenue just off Wilshire . The house behind me has just exploded into flames . And to put it bluntly , all hell is breaking loose . You can see the panic in residents ' faces . And God knows what it is , but something fiery is raining down from the sky . It 's a war zone here . - My dog is in there . - You can 't go in there . My dog is in there . Bill ! Come here , boy . Come here , boy . Bill ! - My dog is in there . Bill ! - He 'll be okay . - Come here , boy . Bill ! - He 'll be okay . Bill ! Come here , boy . Come here , Bill . Come here , Bill . Oh , Bill . - There he is . - Oh , he 's a good dog . You got it . You got it , boy . My house , man . I was born in that house . - I know . - Fire trucks ! How come I don 't see any fire trucks ? - They 're up on Wilshire . - I 'm gonna get some help . - I think you should pull over . - Why ? Because this guy 's leg , it 's , like , gushing . There 's a blanket underneath him . Pull it out and press it down over the wound hard . Look , I think that you should just pull over . If I don 't get to the hospital now , I 'm gonna lose both of these guys . Now do what I tell you and help me out here . Look , Kelly , I know you 're scared . I 'm scared , too . So I 'm gonna need your help . Help me , okay ? Reporter : Still no one has any idea what to put in the way of this lava . Declaration of emergency , immediate assistance from county , state , and federal , all available National Guard units to this site , and air tankers . We 're gonna have to drop some water here . Okay , now listen , Mike . I 've got a bunch of meds coming in . I 'm gonna route them over to Midway . - Is that okay with you ? - No , no . Send them to Cedars . That 's where we 're sending the patients . It 's the safest place . All right , Cedars . Good . Look , I just got a little message here from Sindelar . He 's stuck on the damn freeway directing traffic . - He wants me to tell you ... - I 've got a desk . - That 's where I work . - And never shall you stray . - Yadda , yadda , yadda . - Tell him not to expect me . No problem . Mitch , it 's an even more chaotic scene here with emergency personnel still desperate to find some way of stopping this thing . Officers ! Do you know where the driver of that bus is ? - What are you talking about ? - Come with me . Come on . Right now rolling past the County Art Museum igniting palm tree after palm tree . Well , we now have a name for this crisis . It is , according to the US Geological Survey , a volcano . Yes , you heard that correctly . As remarkable as it sounds , a volcano here ... Amy : Excuse me ! Oh , my . You would have loved this , Rachel . Cover ! - Cover ! - Hey ! Hey , hey ! Don 't . Look at it . Keep watching it . Now ! Move ! You guys , that way ! It 's a lava bomb . You don 't do anything until you know where it 's gonna land . All right , I need 20 strong men as soon as you can get them standing right here . Go get those firemen right now . Get those officers right there . Get over here , guys . Right over here by this bus . Right now . Let 's go , hurry up . God , This Hieronymus Bosch is heavy . That 's ' cause he deals with man 's inclination towards sin in defiance of God 's will . - I didn 't mean it like that . - Oh . All right , fellas , come over here . Right over here , please . - Are you all right ? - Hardly . All right , gentlemen , what I want to do is move the bus up against the museum like so . - Like so ? - Yes , like so . Then I want to shoot out the tires on the other side of the bus . I cannot turn it over unless the tires on one side are flat . All right ? What we want to do is build a corridor to keep whatever this is out of the middle of Wilshire . - It 's lava . - All right , it 's lava . - What ? - Get around to the front , fellas . Hurry up . Let 's move . Get around to the front of the bus . All right , on the count of three , fellas . One ... two , three . We got it . Go , go . All right . Police officers on the other side of the bus . Shoot out those tires . Rest of you guys right along this bus . Right here . Come here . All right , on the countdown . Aim low . Three , two , one , fire . All right , we know that stuff is lava . What do I do next ? You have got to evacuate the Westside . This thing is gonna burn through the city until it hits the ocean . The Westside ? There 's a million people . They 're gonna be a million dead or homeless people if we don 't evacuate . This is going to destroy everything it touches . All right , he 's still breathing . Can you grab this arm ? - Yeah . He 's heavy . - Grab there . Right there . All right , here comes the lava . Let 's go , let 's go . All right , let 's get this guy out of here . Are you getting a sense of what we are dealing with here ? This is a volcano . All we can do is get out of its way . You mean run for the hills and hide . - That 's right . - I can 't do that , not ever . - Look out ! - Oh , God . Look out . Stay with this guy . Stay with him . Hey , get that ladder over here now . - Bring it down . - What are you gonna do ? - What are you doing ? - Get us out of here if I can . Fireman : Hey , watch out for those flames . - All right , grab his feet . - Get that ladder out of the fire . - The hose is gonna burn . - Come here . - Out of here ! Move out ! - We 're not gonna do this . Pull it out ! Get out of here , move . Oh , God ! - Oh , God . Oh , God . - Hang on . - Push them in . - I can 't , the ladder 's buckling . There 's too much weight on it . I 'm gonna have to swing ' em over . Move it . He couldn 't swing us the other way ? I 'll ask him when we get down there . The hose is burning . The hose is on fire . - The hose ! - Ah ! - Shit ! - Hold on . I 'm holding on ! Faster . Move it . They 're cooking in there . I 'm burning ! My feet are burning ! Keep the guy still . The ladder 's gonna give . It 's buckling . Keep him still ! It 's gonna break ! The ladder 's going . Keep still . You 're moving your legs . - Keep still . - Move it ! - Hang on . Hang on . - Stop kicking ! Oh , my God . This guy needs some oxygen . Get him over to Cedars right away . You all right ? Oh , sorry . Sorry . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Oh , God , I 've never been better . So what do we do now ? Come on . That lava is coming from a vent . The bad news is there could be other vents . Maybe bigger ones . Maybe even 10 times as big . Which means we probably have not seen the main eruption yet . - You think that 's going to happen ? - I don 't know . I need specifics . I need a phone . - A phone . Give me that . - Hey , I need that back . - Get off the line . - Stay where you are . I 'm right here . I need that back . Hey , look , the lava 's moving around the bus . - It 's working . - Give me that phone . - Hey , that 's property of KNX . - Not anymore , pal . All right , Emmit , how soon can you get me a couple hundred K-rails ? - I want to build a corridor . - What are K-rails ? They 're freeway dividers . Concrete freeway dividers . Are you planning on channeling this ? I don 't think flood control is gonna work . - I 'm on the telephone , all right ? - Sorry , sorry . Mike , I 'm gonna put a call into Public Works . I think they probably have something we can use , too . - Roark . - And any private contractor we have that 's working on freeways , doing roadwork ... Roark ! Whoa . And call Gator . Cedars is gonna be swamped . I want him over there . You don 't want him there with you ? No , Kelly is on her way to Cedars now . - She got burned , Emmit . - Shit . Look , she 'll have a suite by the time the sun comes up , all right ? All right , out . Out . What ? All right , the bus is just deflecting this , okay ? It is coming back around . It 's obviously got in the store . We are dealing with very determined stuff here . All right , we 're gonna have to build some berms - until the K-rails get here . - Yeah ? With what ? Well , we 'll dig up the sidewalk . We 'll dig up the street . We 'll improvise , okay ? Reporter : Literally hundreds of firemen , police , city workers have grabbed jackhammers , pickaxes , they 've grabbed shovels , to try to channel this lava . ... the ash and the smoke in the air right now even make a dent in this latest attack on Los Angeles . That wall has to be five or six feet tall , fellas . - Stay with it . - It 's hitting every side street . We 've got structural fires , a couple hundred inhalation cases already . I can 't keep it up unless you get me some help . I 'm working on it . In the meantime , do everything you can to keep it on Wilshire . You push abandoned vehicles in there with your fire trucks if you have to right there . My street 's on fire . You got to get some trucks down there . - What street ? - What street ? The one with the smoke coming out of it . - Stanley , right over there . - Soon as we get this under control . There won 't be any houses left by then , man . Look , I 'm sorry . We 'll get to it when we can . Yo , I 'm talking about people 's houses . You 're up here saving a museum . You want to get this guy off me ? - Hey ! - Oh , great . Mark Fuhrman . - Let me see your hands . - You got to be joking . Give me your hands . Yo , get your goddamn hands off me . - Terry , what 's going on ? - Harassing a firefighter . Bullshit . I was asking that guy for help . Terry , this is stupid . Let him go . - I 'm taking him in . - All right , he 's all yours . - Shouldn 't you be saving lives ? - Don 't move . Watch that third rail . I don 't want anybody hitting that . - Damn it , it 's hot . - It 's getting hotter . Watch that rubble right there . Watch for the rubble . Oh , Jesus . There she is . Looks like we got a hell of a fire , Stan . Yeah , we sure do . All right , let 's go . Let 's go . Double time , let 's go . Can 't be gas . They turned off the whole quadrant . It 's got to be electrical . Call LAFD . Tell them there 's a fire 500 yards from MacArthur Park station . Get those first aid kits and those oxygen masks down here now . Here , give me that . Come on . Hit it . Come on , hit it . Oh , my God . Give me a push . Let 's check these people out in here . Check ' em out at the other end . I 've got a pulse here . Look at the other one . Come on , hurry up . How many we got ? Give me a count here . Give me a count . Some oxygen up here ! - Stan . - Just a second . Just a second . Stan ! Let 's get everybody out of here on the station floor right away . What do you got , Pete ? What the hell is that ? Get off the train . Get off the train ! Every one of these bodies off the train now ! Fireman 's carry , go ! Go ! - We can 't get them all . - Anybody see the driver ? - Give me your gloves . - What are you doing ? I 'm gonna go find the driver . Every one of these people off the train now . - Stan ! - Come on , move it . Go ! Go ! Pete : Stan , get back here ! We are in the parking lot at Cedars-Sinai and this is an absolutely incredible scene . These injured people are staying in the parking lot because the emergency room right now is filled to capacity . The injured just keep coming here one after another . This to me seems more like a MASH unit than a major metropolitan hospital . Yeah ? - Gator , you got my little girl ? - Right here . - How is she ? - Doc says she 's gonna be fine . - Nearly done . - Let me talk to her . Man 's got a direct line to the governor , but he 's calling you . - I 'm fine , Daddy . - This is gonna sting . Honestly , I 'm okay . Okay ? I love you , baby . Then stop sending bodies this way . We have got a full house over here . Well , I don 't have any choice . Cedars-Sinai is the only emergency room that 's still safe north of the flow . We got earthquake victims , car accidents , burns . We got a ton of smoke inhalation . They 're doing triage on the sidewalk . Put the post-ops in the mall . Beverly Center 's got to have its own power . Put ' em in there . - The mall , huh ? - Yeah . Anything good at the Cineplex ? I 'll have the cops close down all the streets for you , Gator . Jesus . Oh , God damn it . Jesus H. Christ . Did you see that ? The flow 's gonna turn . Yeah , I saw it . What 's south of here , Lieutenant ? Convalescent homes , hospitals , residences . I 'll tell you what 's south of us . A big gas station . And a million houses and everyone I know . Where do you think you 're going ? Get back in there . - We need everybody we can get . - Shit . Mike : Emmit , where are those K-rails ? I need them right now . Hey , Terry , what were you trying to do , take that guy downtown ? Better take the freeway , man . - Wilshire 's looking pretty bad . - Hey , enough . Let 's get these people on the cart . Come on , Stan . Come on , Stan . Come on , Stan . Where the hell are you ? Holy Mary , mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee ... Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , mother of God ... Get on the walkie . Make sure Jenkins is at the station . - It 's Stan . - There he is . - Jump , Stan ! - Come on , Stan ! Stan , get out of there ! Jump ! Get out of here ! Stan , you can 't save him . - Come on ! - Jump ! - Forget him . - Come on , Stan . - Come on ! - Come on ! Save yourself ! Emmit , FAA is on the line . They want an update . - Where are we with the airports ? - We shut down all outgoing . Everything incoming is being rerouted to Ontario . No , no , no , Marty . No . Look at that screen , okay ? That cloud is blowing due east . We got to send everything to San Diego . Emmit , they got a couple of gas lines burning up Fairfax . They can 't get any hydrant pressure . It 's like a blowtorch . This thing 's gonna pop . - Swimming pools . - What about swimming pools ? Pump out all the swimming pools . That 's thousands of gallons a pop . - That 's all the water we need . - Emmit . Emmit . Just got a call from La Brea . There 's total gridlock from Pico to Sunset . Didn 't we send over all those damn traffic cops ? That 's who 's calling . They 're stuck at Olympic . Cars keep stalling out because of all the ash . It 's clogging up the air filters . Chevettes , right ? Okay , okay . Now you can see it . Coming right at us . Just a relentless tide of lava melting the street itself . It simply incinerates everything it touches . They 're using concrete , they 're using cars , they 're using benches ... You 've got to get me some water pressure . I 'd love to . The whole city 's out . - The hydrants are going dry . - Lights are out in San Francisco . We 've got to get these guys some help . - They 're getting their asses kicked . - Yeah , I can see that . Don 't you hear me ? The lights are out in San Francisco . The street is on fire . Nobody gives a shit about San Francisco . All right , good to see you . What we want to do is build a corridor out of these K-rails , keep everything flowing down Wilshire and headed west , all right ? - Where are the rest of them ? - What rest of them ? - This is it . - There 's only about 80 here . 82 . Everything else is stuck on the 5 or the 10 . We 're trying to keep this city in one piece , pinhead . - 80 rails ain 't gonna do it . - What 're you blaming me for ? Convenience , okay ? Maybe we could chopper more in . One at a time ? Forget about it . Why don 't we knock down a couple of buildings and block this son of a bitch ? All right , come with me . You guys come with me . - You got to open up a reservoir . - And the city drinks what ? There won 't be a city if you don 't get off your ass . - I 'm doing the best I can . - Knock this shit off . What is with you people ? Chief , how long 's it gonna take this stuff to get to Fairfax ? At the speed it 's moving , about 10 minutes , give or take . Is that enough time to build a barricade ? Oh , fuck it . All right , look . Wilshire Boulevard , Fairfax . 80 K-rails double-stacked in a horseshoe , okay ? A cul-de-sac . That 's got to be a wall at least six feet high . All right , do you have any helicopters , water tankers ? - Not yet , but they 're on the way . - All right , great . Once you get this lava to pool , dump everything you 've got on it all at once , try to form a crust . Maybe it 'll dam itself . That 's what they did in Iceland . Thank you . You 're welcome . This is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg . I got to tell you , I don 't know how many men we should keep putting in front of this thing . We 're gonna put as many people in front of it as it takes . Listen up , people , let me tell you what 's south of us . No more museums , no more department stores . Just homes . People , if we turn and run now , they 're gonna be defenseless . You don 't like my plan , that 's good . Give me another plan , but don 't tell me we 're backing out . - Is everybody clear on that ? - Yeah ! All right , let 's go build a wall . Come on , CAT , push ' em over . Push ' em over . All right , come on , push ' em on in . Give me 14 to 15 guys on each one of these things . Right over here . On this K-rail . Right in here . Right in here . Hold it , hold it . Somebody hold this thing on the other side . Watch your legs . Right over here , fellas . Right over here . Pick ' em up ! Right up under . Let 's go . - Let 's go . - Come on . We need more guys on this one . Shit , it 's too heavy . Hey , man , you know what they say . No pain , no gain . - All right , that 's it . - I knew it . Here it comes . I 'm about to be the volcano version of Rodney King . Officer : Give me your hands . Roll tape , fellas . Y 'all got this , huh ? Give me your hands . - Go home . - I 'm supposed to say thanks ? No . - What 'd you do that for ? - Let 's go . Come on , now . Still don 't have enough guys over here . Give us a hand . Yo , you block this shit , it stays out of the neighborhood , right ? Yeah , that 's the idea . Come on , let 's go . Come on , move . Move ! Come on . What you waiting for ? - Come on ! - All right . Let 's move this thing ! One , two , three . All right , come on . Wheel it in . Wheel it in . Get it in there . Okay , keep moving . Over there . With so many people who have been horribly injured , it is so easy to forget the victims who can 't tell you where it hurts . And fortunately these wonderful veterinarians put their lives on hold to help these animals . This is a great story . This potbellied pig was actually trying to find his owner ... Okay , just one more stitch . You 're really brave , you know that ? We got internal bleeding here . Can you watch her ? Are you okay ? Yeah . - Is the boy hers ? - Yes . Hi , sweetie . We 're putting the kids in the mall . - Prep her . - Mommy . - Mommy . - How are you at babysitting ? Get me a milligram of epi on board now . - Hi . - Hi . You okay ? Step right up . We don 't have a lot of time . - Roark . - Yeah ? There is lava in the Red Line . Just came through on the emergency band . It overtook a subway train near MacArthur Park and completely destroyed it . - It is still flowing ? - It stopped . But I think there 's more under us . There 's got to be something feeding this from below . A source . We know it broke through here at the tar pits , created this vent . We now know that it broke through at MacArthur Park . That means that it 's traveling laterally underground over the course of at least eight miles . Yesterday you said it flows straight up . I 've never tracked lava under a city before , okay ? I just don 't know what it 's going to do with man-made tunnels to travel through . It doesn 't matter . I need everything I 've got to deal with what 's in front of me . I don 't have time to take a flier - on a geological theory . - All right , but somebody 's got to . I can only fight what I can see . I know . Good luck . - I 'm gonna check it out . - All right . Here 's a recap of the crisis as it stands at this hour . Throughout the city , Red Cross shelters are being hastily erected out of high school gymnasiums , churches , and synagogues in an attempt to house the flood of shaken citizens now left homeless . Okay , ready , you guys ? Ready ? One , two , three . Shh . Okay , rock beats scissor and scissor beats paper . I 'm not paper , I 'm lava . What beats that ? My dad . I hope . Save your hoses , Chief . I want to let it pool up all the way to the top . - Save your hoses . - Hold the hoses . None across until I give the word . Just have to wait it out now . This is the moment of truth . The entire street is now completely engulfed . The weight of this lava has got to be absolutely intense . Will this plan work ? All right , that 's it , Chief . Open ' em up . - Open hoses ! - Open hoses ! There must be thousands of gallons of water being dropped over this entire area . The entire area is absolutely drenched and the steam that is coming off of this thing is unbelievable . Oh , shit . Oh , God . Reporter : I don 't believe this . It looks ... it looks just possible that this whole thing may be nearing an end . It 's working . This incredible gamble seems to be paying off . Did we just beat this bastard ? It looks like it . - Flood control ! - Ladies and gentlemen , - it is a miracle of the Miracle Mile . - Hallelujah ! Reporter : Look at the faces of these people . Look at these guys . It looks like they 've done it . They have accomplished the impossible . They 've beaten back Mother Nature and claimed an extraordinary victory over the volcano . One last heroic stand here on the corner of Fairfax and Wilshire . Hell of a party . I probably should have brought a hat . - Chief . - Yeah ? They need some help over on Stanley . Structural fires . Residential . Miller , get your engine over to Stanley . Yes , sir . I guess that 's my bus . Hey , good luck . You , too , man . Let 's see what this baby can do . Come on , you ready or what ? Yo , I always wanted to ride one of these things , man . Stanley Ave . , here we come . Whoo ! You 're a good man , Terry . All right , Roark . Way to go , guys . Roark . Hey , way to go . How fast can you get to the corner of Wilshire and Western ? - We got a problem . - No , not anymore . We got it stopped . The volume of ash coming down is way too high to think - that we 're out of danger . - Then how come it stopped ? Maybe it didn 't . Maybe it just went someplace else . How do you know it didn 't just stop ? You know , I don 't . But when Mount St. Helens blew , the force was 27,000 times greater than that of the Hiroshima bomb . You think that vent released anywhere near - that much energy yet ? - No . Let 's just assume we haven 't seen the real bulk of the magma yet , okay ? Trust me , get down here . Shit . Hey , hey ! That 's my bike ! As crews battled the flow on Wilshire and Fairfax , emergency rooms at Cedars-Sinai , Midway , and Kaiser Permanente hospitals have all reported that their staffs and supplies are being ... Yes ? Jaye , I want you back home with me where it 's safe . Norman , can we talk later ? I don 't like his breathing . Let 's tube him . Norman : Jaye , you 've been there for hours . Let someone else take over . God knows what those people are coughing up on you . Dr. Calder , we need some help over here . - I 'm hanging up now . - Jaye ! Amy : Go ! Oh ! Right over the Red Line . That steam could come from anywhere . Maybe the earthquake broke a water main . - How 'd it get heated ? - I don 't know . - You 've got to lower me down . - I 'm not letting you go down there . - Why ? It 's too dangerous ? - Yes . - I thought it was a water main . - All right , I 'll go . You 'll go ? How are you gonna get up ? - I 'm gonna lift you ? - I 'm not letting you go . Then what are we gonna do ? Oh , God . This is so stupid . The city 's finally paying for its arrogance . Which particular arrogance is that ? Building a subway under land that 's seismically active . Yeah , it was a foolish man that built his house upon the sand . Mathew 7 : 26 . A favorite among geologists . All right , there 's the tunnel . - I don 't see anything . - What way are we facing ? - West ? - I don 't know . I can 't see anything . Huh ? - Hey ! - Ah ! Oh ! Damn . Ah , damn ! Oh , God . The tunnel 's insulating it . It 's like a lava tube . It 's keeping it superheated and fluid , which is why it 's moving so fast . Yeah , but moving where ? It 's gonna go through the tunnels until it hits a block . When it hits a block , it 's gonna punch through . You mean erupt . Yeah . One , two , three . How far between tunnel sections ? - How should I know ? - Guess . 10 or 12 feet . Yes , this is Roark . I need to know where the Red Line stops . Got to figure out how fast this this is moving . You mean where the last station is ? No , no , no . Where did you stop the tunnel ? We stopped drilling under the Beverly Center at La Cienega . My God . That 's where Cedars-Sinai is . That 's where Kelly is . How long before it hits La Cienega ? Hold on . How long before it hits La Cienega ? I don 't know . If a tunnel 's caved in anyplace , it 's gonna be a little bit slower . God , 30 minutes , maybe less . That 's no good . That 's not enough time . - No kidding . - We got to move those people . No , no . That ain 't a possibility , Mike . We don 't have any hands left for that kind of evacuation . We got secondary fires popping off all over the city . They 're looting in Beverly Hills , for Christ 's sake . All right , then we have to reroute it or block it in some way . We got 2,000 people in the way down there , Emmit . Mike , listen , Moses couldn 't reroute this shit , okay ? It 's everywhere . We got a flow in the storm drain under Fairfax . The Genesee transformer 's out . That means the whole Westside ... Wait , wait . Where 's that storm drain go ? It dumps into Ballona Creek . - What ? - What did you just say ? - Emmit . - Hold on ! Hold on ! It dumps into Ballona Creek . Ballona Creek goes into the ocean . Yeah , we caught a break on that one . Yeah , I would say . How close is it to Cedars ? It 's close enough . All right , listen up , Emmit . I need a demolitions team , LAPD , National Guard , - private contractor or all three ... - Bobby , move . Move ! ... at San Vicente and 3rd right now loaded with everything they 've got . Oh , shit . Man , I want to be like Mike . Reporter : Right outside Cedars , we don 't know what 's going on right now . Officials have told people around here to evacuate immediately . Now realize , these are injured people . Some severely injured . So something is going on . All right , here 's what the lava is doing . It will flow down the Red Line subway tunnel . It will continue until it comes to a dead end right here under this intersection . This is the Holly Hills storm drain extension . It connects here to the Holly Hills trench . And anything that flows into that trench is gonna come through the storm drain on down the Ballona Creek to the ocean . - We got 25 minutes here . - No , we 've got 20 minutes . All right , we got 20 minutes to extend the San Vicente trench 200 yards up San Vicente Boulevard to this place right here . - Extend it ? - Yes , extend it . - Lieutenant , where are we at ? - Ground zero . He said the lava 's gonna break through right here . - Right here ? - Yes , right here . Look , what I want you to do is drill holes in San Vicente Boulevard . Lower enough charges into it to blow up a trench 200 yards long as wide as the street and as deep - as you can possibly make it . - What ? We 're gonna take this thing to the ocean . Wait a minute . This is not gonna work . The street slopes the other way . Look at the contours . Look here . It is not going to move into the trench . It is going to go the opposite direction right into the patients . Maybe some of it can be diverted ... It won 't . Would you trust me ? It is going to flow that way . Now everybody just grab some stretchers . Let 's save as many lives as we possibly can , okay ? There 's a couple of thousand patients . They 're doing surgery in the street . We can 't possibly save everybody . Oh , I know that . I sent them all over there along with my daughter . I ... I don 't ... I don 't know what to do . - What about a dam ? - What ? What about a dam ? Something that we can drop in front of the hospital and divert the flow this way . - What ? - What you said . - Knocking a building down . - Are you serious ? Yes , I 'm serious . Look at that thing . That 's got to be 50,000 tons of steel and concrete . Will that work ? You are gonna knock a building down ? Yes , I am . Will it work ? I think it might . I think it might . Wait , you want to bring that thing down flush against the mall ? - Absolutely . - That 's a precision drop . That takes days to plan . Set a speed record . So you just want to blow up the street and knock down a building in 20 minutes ? - 19 now , buddy . - Let 's split the squad . All right , what do you want me to do ? Find my daughter . Please . I left her with a Dr. Jaye Calder . I gave that woman my child , she gave me this card . Find her . Okay . I 'll find her . Okay ? Trust me . I 'll find her . Sergeant . Bring your men and follow me right now . Caltrans , come this way . Put your first charge right there . Food . Where 's Tommy ? He went through there . Can I have French fries ? Officer : Remain calm . We are evacuating the triage units now . Excuse me . I 'm looking for a little boy . - He 's about three years ... - Un momento . Have you seen a little boy ? He has blond hair . You should be back in there , honey . No , I 'm looking for a little boy . One of the Red Cross people will find him . No , you don 't understand . He 's my responsibility . Everybody out . We 're evacuating the Hard Rock . All right , people . Evacuate . We must leave right now . Everyone put down what you 're doing . Everyone out . We must evacuate . Everyone out . Put down what you 're doing . Come on , let 's go . Bring that through . - Is the building empty ? - Yeah , all clear . We 're told that large amounts of explosives are being brought in from National Guard armories , private contractors , and LAPD depots . That 's good , fellas . It 's an extraordinary effort underway here . Tommy ! This urgent advisory from the city 's emergency operations center . As a result of the emergency situation in the area surrounding the Beverly Center , there is the possibility of a series of explosions . Please do not leave your homes . Stay away from windows and protect yourselves ... They put some kids in the mall . In the Hard Rock , I think . Okay , you 've done your duty . Can we go now ? Do you think there 's a chance she still might be there ? Maybe . She was watching some children . Norman , hold this . What have we got ? - Thank you . - Here , take this . These people are strangers , Jaye . Are you gonna die for them ? Jaye , answer me . I am answering you , Norman . This man 's in cardiac arrest . I 'm defibrillating . - Charging . - Shit ! - Clear ! - I 'm out of here . Not much time . Hurry up . An amazing scene here as demolition teams and city workers pour into the area . Once again , if you live in the Beverly Center area , stay inside and stay away from all the windows . Kelly ! Kelly Roark ! - Kelly Roark ! - Beware of flying glass . Kelly ! Kelly Roark ! - Low , are you set ? - Ready ! - Danny , are you all ready ? - We 're good . Here it comes . - Danny , are you ready ? - 10 seconds away . You haven 't got 10 seconds . It 's coming . It 's coming . Everybody out ! Everybody out ! Get out of here ! Move it ! Move it ! - Come on , come on . - Come on , move ! - Go , go , go , go ! - Give me a hand here . - Put them in . - We got to move , buddy . It 's gonna blow . It 's gonna blow . - I 'm done ! - Look out ! What the ? My God . Reporter : This is just an incredible scene . We are watching , literally , a stampede ... Some ... some ... My leg , I think it 's busted . Get me out of here . - Ah ! - It 's broken . Kelly Roark ! - Tommy . - Start detonation sequence . Ah ! It isn 't gonna budge . Go on , get out of here . - You can make it if you run . - I won 't leave a man down . I 'm gonna get you out of here , pal . - La Cienega , are we clear ? - La Cienega clear . - Lower San Vicente ? - Lower San Vicente all clear . - Upper San Vicente ? - Upper San Vicente all clear . Tower ? Tower , can we go ? We have to go . I repeat , are we clear ? I got all hell breaking loose up here . We got to go now . I repeat , are we clear ? - We got to go now . - Tower clear . I copy . Go . Hold it . Hold it , there 's a kid out there . There 's a kid out there on 3rd and San Vicente . Hold it . Hold it . There 's a kid out there . Tommy . Get out of there ! Kelly , get out of there ! Abort . There 's people . Abort the ... stop the explosions ! Reporter : The skyscraper ... Dad . Get out of there ! Kelly , get out of there ! Reporter : Jim , as far as we can tell through the clouds of dust and rubble , this audacious plan seems to be working . Relieved city officials are breathing their first sigh of relief in many hours as this desperate strategy looks like it 's paying off . And in the triage area there is rejoicing as the lava flow ... Mike Roark ? Mike Roark , are you there ? Mike ? Reporter : ... through the dust and smoke there is an atmosphere of celebration here . People are laughing and smiling . Feeling a sense of more than just relief . And about 200 feet away , there is a 20-story apartment building lying on its side , a temporary dam . Roark ? Roark , can you hear me ? Roark ! Roark , can you hear me ? The flow is at Crescent Heights and turning . The trench is holding . The improvised rerouting through the storm drains and trenches seems to be holding . Roark ! Amy : Roark ! Approaching Wilshire intersection . The flow is passing underneath the 10 freeway . And way down below us we can see that fiery flow moving along the creek . The concrete walls seem to be holding up against the weight of the lava as it steams toward the Pacific . - Roark ! - Roark ! Mike : Hey ! Over here ! Katie : Just got word on Mike . He 's okay . His little girl , too . - Roark is okay . - Nice . Reporter : And it is good news at last . Satellite pictures show the volcano is shutting down . The lava is subsiding . This may be the first chance for stunned Angelinos to finally look around and take stock . For with nearly 100 dead , thousands injured , and damage in the billions , this crisis has surely touched every one of us . Let 's go find your mom . What 's she look like ? She looks like ... Look at their faces . They all look the same . Well ... had I been in charge , I would have evacuated the Westside , sacrificed half the city , maybe made parking a little easier in Beverly Hills , but I would have been wrong . If you 'd have been in charge , we would have known about this 24 hours in advance . You saved a lot of lives today . Aw , shucks , Roark . I let the guy out of my sight for one minute . Max , go . Go . Hey , Kelly . Look who we brought you . - Max ! - Hey , Maxie . Aw . Just another day at the office , huh ? Yeah . Mr. Roark . We got a phone call for you . It 's Chief Sindelar . Yeah , just a moment . - Finally made it in , huh ? - Yeah . He says we got mudslides in Malibu . Yeah , a couple hundred structural fires , gas and power 's down over half the city , gridlock on all the freeways . Hope you got some bright ideas for this . I do . You handle it . I 'm on vacation . I 'm going home with my daughter . Come on . Come on , Max . You know , I could get used to this , Mike . All right , let 's go . Hello , Chief . No , it 's still Emmit . I know . I don 't know what to tell you . It 's not personal . Yes , it 's raining here , too , sir . Guys , it 's a little wet out here . You want a lift ? Yeah . Well , you said you wanted to go to the Beverly Center . How 'd you like it ? - Huh ? - It was cool , Dad . - Cool ?

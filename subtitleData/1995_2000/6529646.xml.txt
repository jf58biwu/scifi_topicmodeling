 Keep going . Keep going . That 's the way . Don 't stop now . Oh , come on , keep pushing . No pain , no gain . I want five more steps , and then you 're done . Uh-huh . Four ... three ... good . And ... super . Hit it . Nice and easy . You 're really coming along , Bobby . I 'm very pleased with your improvement . Back off . Two fingers on your pepper spray , just like I told you . Mr. Piero , is all this really necessary ? Yes , ma 'am . I 'd say it is . So , what 's this guy 's story ? Cop killer . Regular people killer . General all-around waste of skin . So , what are you scared of ? The guy 's a freaking vegetable . I mean , what 's he going to do , run over you with his big plastic wheel ? I 'll tell you what . You want to last here more than a week , you don 't ever underestimate this man . Never trust him . Never let your guard down around him- - never . Capisce ? Comprendo . What 's up , Modell ? Hey , Chuck ? What the hell happened , Chuck ? Where 's Modell ? He had to go . The orderly is being questioned , but judging by his mental state , he 's not going to be much help to us , so there 's very little we know for sure at this point . What we do know is that the last confirmed bed check was 2 : 04 a.m. As of 6 : 14 a.m. , the subject was reported escaped . Since then , there have been no further sightings or contact . How did this man make his way out of the building ? Every indication is he simply walked out the front door . Due to the ... unique nature of this investigation , the FBI will head the manhunt . The Marshals Service will lend their much-welcomed expertise and will coordinate all their efforts with myself or my two designated S.A.C. ' s , Agents Mulder and Scully . They apprehended the subject the first time around . Agent Mulder . The subject 's name is Robert Patrick Modell . He 's a serial killer responsible for at least 17 murders . Specifically , he targets law enforcement . In 1996 , he caused the deaths of an FBI agent and a Loudoun County sheriff 's deputy . It was all a game to him . He was looking for , in his words , " a worthy adversary . " To win makes him feel important . He likes to think of himself as a Ronin , a warrior without a master , adhering to the budo , the Japanese way of war . In truth , he 's a highly intelligent sociopath who has no fear of dying . In keeping with his game archetype , he likes to leave clues . This is why we expect to be contacted by him hopefully sooner rather than later . We fully expect him to pick up - exactly where he left off . - What did you mean before when you said he just walked out of the building ? Modell refers to himself as " Pusher . " Technically speaking , all of his victims ' wounds were self-inflicted . This man has a unique ability to force his will upon others , to " push " his victims into hurting or killing themselves . Say what ? Okay , look , this is all you need to know : Do not trust this man , do not talk to him , do not engage him in conversation even if he is unarmed . Approach him only with extraordinary caution , and then only with adequate backup . So what 's " adequate backup " ? " Adequate backup " ? Every cop you can lay your hands on . Line up for your assignments . What 's Modell 's condition ? Extremely weakened . The doctors here say that he can barely even walk . Oh , yeah ? Yeah , Mulder , I 'm amazed he 's even alive . The condition that we last saw him in- - comatose with a bullet in the head . How did he recover ? Well , apparently , one day , about six months ago , he simply woke up . It 's unusual , but it 's not unheard of . What about his brain tumor that was supposed to be killing him ? It still is . Is there anybody on staff here we can talk to ? He has a physical therapist . Mulder ? What if Modell plans to pick up where he left off ? Where does that leave you ? You were his prime target . Should you even be heading this investigation ? As opposed to what ? What 's your point ? That it 's exactly what he wants : that once again , you 're playing his game . The escaped inmate , Robert Patrick Modell , was convicted in 1996 of charges stemming from an incident in which he brandished a firearm in a downtown hospital . Two people died . Officials are cautioning area residents not to approach this man . He is considered to be extremely dangerous . Paul ? Can I help you ? Hi . You 're not scared of snakes ? Huh ? Looks like a timber rattler . Hold on tight to the neck now . Don 't let it bite you . Don 't drop it . You drop it , it 'll get you . Todd ... do you think I could get some service now ? Yeah . Go into the back and put the snake down . Uh , Diane , we 're gonna run that videotape again from this morning . Certainly , Paul . This was the scene here at Lorton Penitentiary less than one hour ago . Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , along with the U.S. Marshal Service and representatives of local law enforcement , met to assemble a multi-agency task ... He couldn 't have been faking it completely . That 's all I can say . The gunshot wound did a hell of a lot of damage . You 're the officer that shot him . It says here that Modell had a visitor yesterday afternoon . Who ? It 's marked " LSC . " Little Sisters of Charity . They try to visit all the hospitalized inmates . Did Modell ever get any other visitors besides the Little Sisters of Charity ? Not that I know of . He didn 't have much in the way of family . He was raised in foster homes , mostly . Sounds like you got to know him pretty well . He never gave me any grief . He worked hard at getting better . I 'd talk to him sometimes . About what ? Small talk- - nothing important . He 'd ask how I was . He 's a very considerate man . I don 't doubt for a second Robert Modell belongs in prison , but I never had any problem with him personally . Agents . It 's Modell . He 's asking for you . We 're running a trace right now . We just need 30 seconds . Mulder ? Yeah . Two words : it 's alive . I don 't feel like playing your game right now , Modell . Touchy . Look , Mulder , there 's something I need you to hear . Tell it to me in person , Modell . No . Seriously , listen to me . No , you listen to me . Either you come back here on your own or I drag your sorry ass back on the bumper of my car . - Time ? - Ten more seconds . When did you turn into Clint Eastwood ? Don 't let him rope you in . Now , stop talking like a tough guy and pay attention . I know you 're tracing this call . I don 't care . I have something - I need you to hear . - Mulder , hang up the phone . Mulder , are you going to ... We got it . - Go ! - Go , go , go ! Watch yourself ! Move in ! There 's nothing back there . How far could he get ? Outside ! Where is he ? Where 's Modell ? ! He had to go . I 'm going to take a wild stab here and guess this is a clue . It appears as if he died from ingesting paint . I imagine that he did all of this , and then drank what was left . See what you can make of it . Modell ? Cerulean blue . What the hell 's the point of all this ? Maybe his choice of victim . This is Nathan Bowman with the Loudoun County Attorney 's Office . He 's the prosecutor that tried Modell in 1996 . So you think it 's simple revenge ? Sir ... it 's not a manifesto . It 's the same single idiogram over and over . Which is what ? Well , the hand it 's in is pretty sloppy , but I think it 's supposed to be kitsunegari- - fox hunt . Fox Mulder . Well , that 's a little on the nose , don 't you think ? Was Nathan Bowman married ? Yep . What are you thinking ? " Linda . " Bet that 's his wife , huh ? - Novamax Realty . - Hi , Linda ? I 'm sorry , Mrs. Bowman has left the office to meet a client . Uh , may I take a message ? Do you know the name of the client that Mrs. Bowman went to see ? It 's , uh ... Mr. Fox Mulder . - It 's him . - Location . Find out where he 's at . Do you ... do you know where Mrs. Bowman went to meet Fox Mulder ? A location ? I know it 's a commercial property in Falls Church . Um , can you hold on , please ? Yeah . Give me the Falls Church PD . This must be the place Unit six at 214 Channel Avenue . Signs of forced entry . We 're going to check it out . Exercise extreme caution , six . Backup is en route . Hello . Officer ... I 'm over here . Keep on coming . That 's right . No , not that way . Not that way , either ... but you 're getting warmer . Dead ahead . Straight in front of you . Buddy , I 'm straight in front of you . What do you want me to do , draw you a map ? Keep coming . Almost there . Put it down ! Put the gun down . Put it down . Now ! On the floor . Facedown . Do it ! Marty , I got him ! Get up here ! Let 's go ! Move ! Federal agents ! Officer , where are you ? Upstairs ! Sir , I got him ! I got him ! He 's gone crazy ! Get him the hell away from me . Give me your gun . - Just give me the gun . - He was here . He did come for the woman . Why Bowman 's wife ? What would he want with her ? Hey , we got a visitor ! Linda Bowman ? I 'm Fox Mulder . Hi . Uh ... you 're my 12 : 15 ? The appointment was made this morning through my secretary . All I know is I was supposed to meet a Mr. Mulder here . He didn 't leave a number , and I couldn 't call him to tell him that I was running late . Why would someone do this to Nathan ? Mrs. Bowman ... did your husband ever discuss his work as a prosecutor with you ? Sometimes . Did he ever mention the name Robert Patrick Modell ? Pusher ? That was Nathan 's biggest case . Why ? Can you think of any reason why this man Modell would take an interest in you ? What do you mean ? We believe he murdered your husband . It also appears that he 's the man that made the appointment to see you today . No ... no , no , he 's in prison . Not since 6 : 00 this morning . Oh , God . You 're safe with us , Mrs. Bowman . If you 'll come with me , we 'll place you in protective custody . Find him . Yes , sir . Mulder ? Why didn 't Modell just kill those two cops ? What was to stop him ? Well , hopefully , he was incapable . As in too tired ? Well , we 've seen that before with him . Maybe . I don 't know . Something 's just not making sense . Can I borrow your radio ? Yes , sir . Gracias , amigo . What took you so long ? Scully , I got him . Come quick . Where are you , Mulder ? - Hold on . - North side of Channel , second floor . - Hold on , now . Hold on . - Some kind of company . Some engineering company . - We need to talk . - Shut up , Modell . - Mulder , listen to me . - I said shut up ! There 's something I need you ... Shut up or I will shoot you , you son of a bitch . Mulder ... I will shoot you . Shut up . You 're going to listen to me . You 're going to listen to me , Mulder . I will shoot you . Listen . Mulder ... Mulder ... Mulder , what happened ? Where 's Modell ? He had to go . About ten minutes ago . He can 't have gotten far . Anything ? No sign . Yes , Agent Mulder 's fine . Yes , sir . How are you feeling ? Well , aside from the utter grinding humiliation that comes from knowing I let our suspect go , pretty good . It could have happened to anyone , Mulder . No , actually , it couldn 't have . I didn 't find Modell ; he sought me out . He wanted me to hear his message . Which was what ? " Don 't play the game . " Whose game ? His ? I don 't think so . I 'm not even sure he 's playing a game . What are you talking about ? Of course he is . You said yourself that he was going to pick up where he left off . Then why didn 't he kill the cops or the prison guard ? Or , hell , while we 're at it , why didn 't he kill me ? Why didn 't he make me eat a bullet out of my own gun ? He could have . He killed Nathan Bowman . Yeah , he was definitely there , but that doesn 't prove that he did it . Mulder , this man 's affected you . He 's influenced your thinking . It 's not like that . A man is made to drink a gallon of cerulean blue paint . Kitsunegari- - fox hunt . You 're saying now that 's not Modell ? Modell is involved- - he 's related to it somehow , but not the way you think . That 's your opinion . Yeah ... that 's my opinion . How can you be sure it 's your own ? What do we still agree on here ? That Modell was pursuing Linda Bowman ? I 'd like to know why . I 'm sorry . I don 't know if I can tell you much more than I already have . We appreciate your help . I know Nathan was very proud of having prosecuted the case . He said this man Modell was extremely clever and dangerous and that he was a menace to society . Nathan mentioned that an FBI agent had ultimately shot him . Was that you ? Yes . He said you crippled him and put him in a wheelchair . Nathan said it was too bad that you just didn 't kill him . That it would have saved the taxpayers the cost of a trial . Your husband talked with you a lot about it . Well , as I said , he was proud . I guess he felt that ... that it was his brush with greatness . Is it possible that he could have mentioned you to Robert Modell ? No , no . I sincerely doubt it . You see , Nathan and I ... we were only married two months . How long did you know him ? Well , it was two months and two days . Why wait when it 's true love ? You never know how long you have . No , you don 't . It 's not like Nathan was impulsive or flighty . I don 't want to paint him as that . He was true-blue . Thank you . She killed Nathan Bowman . What ? Modell was there , but for some other reason . She killed her husband . - Agent Mulder ... - Wait a minute . Just hear me out . Her husband 's " brush with greatness " ? She doesn 't want " to paint him as being impulsive " ? Who the hell talks like that ? You tell me . She was waving it under our nose . She was playing with us . Modell told me- - he warned me not to play the game . I think it was her game he was talking about . Modell told you ? Has she asked how her husband was murdered ? Has she shown any interest in the details ? An escaped serial killer is supposedly stalking her . Does she seem particularly fearful to you ? The woman 's in shock , Agent Mulder . She 's not herself . I might add : neither are you . You heard her in there , Scully . Mulder , no . I 'm sorry . You said it yourself . You said , " Don 't listen to Modell . Don 't trust him . " But you 've done both . But what if she can do what Modell does ? I think you should go home . You think I should go home ? You 're suspended until such time I 'm confident your judgment is sound . Give me your weapon . Who are you afraid I 'm going to point it at ? Mulder , I think you should do what he says . Excuse me . Would it be possible for me to get something to drink ? Water ? Yes , ma 'am . I 'll have somebody come right in . I 'll prove it . Agent Mulder ? Go fetch her some water . I really don 't know the man that well . I 'm sorry you got the impression that I do . No , just anything at all that you might recall . Um , did he ever talk about his past ? You know , mention anybody special ? A woman , something like that ? No . Anything remarkable he ever said that you can remember . I guess one time someone else said something about him that struck me as unusual . Yeah ? What was that ? It was one of the nuns who visits from Little Sisters of Charity . She , uh ... she once referred to him as a " conquered warrior . " I thought that was kind of weird . Was this the same nun that visited him the day before he escaped ? Yeah , the same one that always visits . How many times did she visit him ? Maybe three , four . Will you take a look at something for me ? Is that the woman ? Is that the nun ? Hang on . I 'm blind as a bat . Therapy room . Here , glasses . Ah . Uh-huh . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . It 's empty . - Where 'd you leave them ? - Uh ... Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Okay . Oh , yeah , he 's here . No ! I need help in here ! Help ! Oh , man , you got him . Go home . What ? Go home . Scully . Hey , Scully , it 's me . Where are you ? I 'm at the prison . Mulder , you were told to lay off . It 's a little late for that now . Modell 's therapist just electrocuted herself right in front of me , and she was on the phone when she did it . It was Modell . It was Linda Bowman . Mulder ! The therapist would have identified her , verified that she visited Modell in the prison . Would have ? You don 't know that . Listen , Scully , just trace the call and cut off any access that woman has to a phone . I 'm heading back there right now . Mulder , I 'm not at the safe house . You 're not ? We 're at the Chain Bridge Mall investigating a suicide . Why isn 't anybody picking up at the safe house switchboard ? Back in the trucks . All right , let 's go . On the floor , Modell ! Hey , it 's Mel Cooley . On your face ! Do it now ! I said now ! I have a gun . How 's his vitals ? Did he try to speak to you ? He said we got our man . What happened ? You were told to go home , Agent Mulder . What happened ? He had a gun . I saw it clearly . It was a revolver . He pointed a gun at you ? We haven 't found the gun yet . He said to you that he had a gun . Yes . And he did . Excuse me . Modell was unarmed . He purposefully drew Skinner 's fire . For what possible reason ? To protect someone . Linda Bowman ? To take the fall for her . That 's one hell of a plan , Mulder . A serial killer makes us believe that he 's guilty , in turn diverting the suspicion away from the real estate lady ? - Well , he had me going . - Where is she ? They 've taken her home . There is no reason to keep her in protective custody , Mulder . It is over . - No , it 's not . - Where are you going ? If Modell makes it through surgery , I want to be the first person that he talks to . Mulder , talking to him has already - done you enough harm . - Okay , look . You do me a favor , Scully . You give me a call when you think I 've come to my senses , all right ? Sir , I 'm going to need to change the patient 's bandages . Call me if he wakes up , please . Yes , sir . Bobby . Why did you do it ? I didn 't ask you to come after me . Don 't ... don 't make a mistake . I 'm not . After what they 've done , do you think I 'd let them get away with this ? I 'm going to finish what you started . No . Stop now . Stop . Bobby ... Bobby , you 're not in any pain . You feel wonderful . You 've never felt better . Your heart is slowing . It 's tired . It 's too worn out to keep beating . Let it rest . It slows ... It slows ... It stops . Hello ? Yes , I have that information for you . I 'll get the lidocaine , Doctor . Never mind . Put him down as 7 : 38 . Yes , Doctor . Sorry . Mulder ? Scully , what are you doing here ? You were right about her , Mulder . Scully ... She 's making me do this . - Where is she ? - She 's here . Mulder , make her stop . I can 't help myself . Linda Bowman ! Mulder , make her stop . Show yourself ! Mulder ! No ! No ! I 'm going to kill you . Don 't listen to her , Mulder . - What ? ! - It 's me . You were right about her . Linda Bowman is pushing you . What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm Scully . Linda 's right behind you . She 's telling you I 'm her . You killed her . Mulder , I 'm Scully . I 'm not dead . She wants you to shoot me . She knows you 'll never forgive yourself . Shut up ! - Listen to me ! - Shut up ! Your mother is Tina . Your sister is Samantha . Shut up ! Modell warned you . Don 't play her game . Mulder . You think you can hold me ? Yes , we 'd like an ambulance to 214 Channel Avenue . Linda Bowman . She has an advanced temporal lobe tumor just like Modell 's . It seems to run in the family . She and Modell are related ? Fraternal twins . He meant to protect his sister . Apparently , she only found out about his existence six months ago . They were separated when they were two weeks old . Raised apart . Her " fox hunt ... " I 'm guessing that she wanted revenge for what she feels we did to her brother . Anything you want to add to that ? No . I think that covers it . Mulder , a moment , please . I just wanted to say you did a good job . How 's that ? Nobody could have figured this out but you . You knew it was Linda Bowman and not Modell . You were way ahead of me . I almost killed my partner . Mulder , despite that , you prevailed . You won her game . How come I feel like I lost ? I made this !

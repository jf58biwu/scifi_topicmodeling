 Steed ! Give me back my arrow , it 's my only clue . - To what ? - The death of Mr. Broom . Found yesterday , with a real arrow in his back . - James Broom , the economist ? - Brillant economist . With revolutionary projects : unite European resources , banishing poverty forever . Europia : a nice dream . Broom was close to making it a reality . " Was " is the key word . This is where it happened . Steed ! D Mr. Carlyon ! D Yes . John Steed . I asked him to meet me here . Mrs. Emma Peel . How do you do ? Carlyon was Broom 's right hand man . Working undercover ? Looking for this . It was hidden . Broom was careful . - Valuables ? - No idea . Shall we ? - Distressing . - Very . - It spoilt my appetite . - It ruined Broom 's . What ? I see . - Where was he going ? - To see a fellow economist . - Who ? - an adversary . Someone intent on stopping us . Broom wouldn 't confiide his name . Too dangerous , he said . But he mentioned a university the man was connected to . - Saint Bode 's ? - How did you know ? It 's written here . St. Bode 's and Broom , logical . a fline economics department . Really , my dear ? Isn 't it time you furthered your education ? 1 and 1 , 2 . 2 and 2 ... You 're right . . This demonstrates the inevitability of history . What must be must be . We think we control history , that we alter its course . This must be doubted , refuted . Nothing supports such an assertion . Not even history . Great events have been the result ... as I was saying ... have been the the result of circumstance , of chance even . I hope I 've been conclusive . I ask you to ponder my arguments , to digest them . That is all . are there any questions ? - I have one , Dr. Henge . - Yes ? If we suggested that one man in the right place , at the right time , could change the course of history , you would disagree ? Mr. Pettit , I have been saying so for an hour : I disagree . Others may hold other views . I suppose . It 's not a matter of conjecture . Pr. acheson disagrees . He has his view , and I have mine . One of you must be wrong though . I take it that you disagree with me and agree with Pr. acheson . What Pettit is saying , is that for the past 53 minutes , you have assaulted our ears with a load of rubbish . Mr. Duboys ... you have the manners of hoodlum ! You have your views , I have mine . Dr. Henge ! Dr. Henge ! I beg your pardon . Isometrics . Exercise without apparatus . Overdid it a bit ! David acheson . - Professor acheson ? - Exactly . You must be Mrs. Peel . Welcome to St. Bode 's . Do you mind ? Such a sedentary occupation . End of term , excuse for high spirits . I just attended Dr. Henge 's lecture . It was more than high spirits . Henge aggravates them . He asks for it . Who is she ? anyone know ? - Well ? - Nobody knows . One student ... - by the name of Duboys . - Eric Duboys ? Very clever . Very promising economist . Thank you . I 'd like to meet him . Up those stairs . Staircase 3 , n ° 18 . She 's coming up . Is she ? Well , well , what a surprise ! Steed , look at this . among Broom 's papers , an economic thesis . " Economics and a Sense of History " . - Read it . - I am . This paragraph here . Pretty strong stuff . - This too . - It 's " continental roasted " ! It 's more and more hysterical . It 's not an economic thesis . It 's political . Full of ideals and dogma . and a whiff of Jack boots . Good heavens ! - No author 's name ? - It has the college crest . an unfortunate encounter . Most unfortunate . Rag Week : we jump 1st year students and persuade them to give to charity . But to land a lecturer ... Do forgive our impetuosity . Forgiven . We wouldn 't dream of offending our betters . - No ? - No . That 's strange . I was in Dr. Henge 's lecture . Oh , Dr. Henge ? - Dear Dr. Henge . - Poor dear Dr. Henge . Poor , dear , sad Dr. Henge . Why do you despise him ? Who said despise ? It 's merely a lack of admiration . Negative appraisal . We call him " Stonehenge " . Why ? He 's a fool , a dodderer . He lives in the past . His ideas are from the past . Many ideas haven 't been bettered . Newton 's law keeps our feet grounded . Your remark only points to the lack in Dr. Henge : he would be incapable of such a ... simple reply . He 's a learned man , respected by his peers . James Broom , for example . You 've heard of him ? Of course . - a brillant man . - Brilliant ! Quite brillant . Or rather , he was . Well , thank you ... for the coffee . Watch her . St. Bode 's isn 't far , I 'll walk it from here . Tattered gown , sign of experience , belonging . Only freshmen wear new gowns . I 'll be in touch . Sorry , young fellow . For a good cause . There we are . For the houselights ... If you have slides or a fiilm ... I have all I need , thanks . If you 've overlooked anything just see the porter . He 'll flix you up . - Good morning . - Good morning . - Who was that ? - Pr. acheson . and the ... ? Isometrics . Exercise without apparatus . I don 't approve . a professor must be stooped ... and venerable . Students should be wide-eyed and ... innocent . What are you doing here ? Research on the relationship between the lesser crested newt and Cybil Peabody . Mrs. Cybil Peabody ? an aunt . Drinks like a fiish . No , recapture my college days . Tea and crumpets . The proctor and his bullfrogs . Moments of triumph on the rugger fileid ! Moments of failure in an examination . I 'm looking for this author . Found in Broom 's briefcase . Very interesting . - It 's everything Broom opposed ! - The motive of his murder . Bound up with the college crest . But who wrote it ? There must be an example with the author 's name . Dr. Henge , could you help us ? This is John Steed . We want to trace ... Sorry ... We want to trace the author of this thesis . Economics and a Sense of History , do you know it ? This university was founded in 1642 , Mrs. Peel . Today there must be 5 000 graduate theses , 2 000 doctoral dissertations , on this subject alone . Thus we have , in the archives a lot of theses . How could I be familiar with this one ? Who wrote it ? I 'm here to fiind out . Grindley , the archivist will help , maybe . - a thesis , Mr. Sted ? - Steed . Steed ... yes . as you can see , we have a surfeit of them . You may borrowthem by the dozen . I want Economics and a Sense of History . I 'd like the author 's name . With your filling system ... There is no filling system . The system is here . That is the way we work . Modern methods involve rush and tear . Knowledge creeps ... We study quietly , gently , traditionally . Of course . - You only want the author 's name ? - Yes . - I 'll see what I can do . - as soon as possible . Gently , traditionally . Thank you . I beg your pardon . Grindley ... - The man who just left ... - Sted ... Steed ? a pleasant fellow . - He asked you to fiind a thesis ? - Yes . He isn 't part of St. Bode 's . It isn 't done , Grindley . We have a tradition to maintain . - This isn 't a library . - He said he was an alumni . - You believed him ? - Does it matter ? Polite , he was . That makes a change . Charming . Nevertheless , using our facilities , putting you to a great deal of trouble ... It 's not so diffiicult . - Have you found what he wanted ? - No . I know howto fiind it . - Well , you know your own business . - Indeed . I have a lecture now and I 'm late . I think I put my notes over here ... Milicent ? - I didn 't know you were here . - No ? - Who is this Steed ? - an alumni . - What 's he doing ? - Research . - To do with newts or something ... - Newts ... We 'll watch him . The big man would like that . Duboys ... Grindley 's late , keeping us waiting . Calls for a demonstration . To express our displeasure . We want Grindley ! We want Grindley ! Yes ... Yes , that 's it . Mr. Grindley ... - Grindley found the author . - and was coming to me . Poor man . Duboys has an alibi . He has his mignons . The severe Dr. Henge came in as I was leaving . - He 's an economist . - He could have written it . It 's no use . There 's no system . You 'll have to trust to luck . - I ? - I have to see Carlyon . You have to pay to walk these cloisters . - Rag Week . - Rather misplaced levity , isn 't it ? You mean Grindley ? You want sackcloth and ashes ? That 's not the way we do things . We , his students , have bore him away and laid him to rest , traditionally . He would have wished it so . But you know all that . You 're supposed to be an ex-student . " Supposed " ? You disbelieve me ? Very sharp ! Think I 'm lying ? Sharper and sharper . another incisive mind , straight to the point . I object . - I object strongly . - Let me go . Very strongly . Get him ! What 's going on ? We were having an academic conversation . Go on . all of you . I 've no idea what 's going on , I 'm sorry . End of term , Mr. Grindley ... There 's hysteria in the air . I understand completely . Jolly decent of you . - They 're usually a decent set . - I like them enormously . Yes ! If Duboys gives you trouble , tell the proctor . I 'll do better : I 'll break his arm . Dr. Henge ? Still looking , Mrs. Peel ? Mr. Grindley promised ... Dr. Grindley is dead . I 'm in charge of archives now . Steed , I 'd given you up . I ran into some fractious students . Find it ? No , but I reread the thesis . analyzed it . and ? The reasoning suggests a very mature mind . - Fingers ? - What ? Oh , yes ... Sorry . - The work of a professor . - Or a brillant student . Duboys is exceptionally brillant and exceptionally nasty . - What about a drink ? - Thank you ! Here . What 's our next move ? With Broom dead , will his economic plan go ahead ? I intend fiinishing off the work he began . Someone is determined to kill the plan . Impossible . Not while I 'm alive ! Good heavens ! You don 't think ... You 're the key man now . Dear ! I 'm sorry . Forgive me . - Realizing my life is in danger ... - Sh ! What ? It 's just an owl . Two of them . Seriously , do you think that I need protection ? No , there are several . Calling out ... Really , your interests in a nocturnal bird are ... Steed ! I must protest ! They 're back . Mary ann , isn 't it ? Mary ann Grey . It 's a very good likeness . Who is he ? Whose is this ? He 's in trouble . Be sensible and ... Leave her be ! Is this yours ? Yes . That 's right . It 's mine . Get out and keep away from us ! - Shall we talk ? - I have nothing to say . Last night you almost killed me . Why ? We wanted to scare you . and Grindley ? You scared him to death . I wasn 't involved . There 's somebody bigger . Duboys is scared of him . I 'm being nice . You 're not worth the trouble . There is someone else , but I don 't know who . Help me fiind him . How ? I 'd like to know who wrote this . It should be in the archives . They 're a shambles . Only Grindley knewthe system . He told you that ? He wanted to sound important . It 's not that diffiicult . anyone who knows the archives would fiind it in 5 minutes . You , for instance . You 're in this up to your neck ... all right , I 'll do my best , but later . Tonight , when there 's no one . Pettit ! Mary ann ... You haven 't forgotten the Rag Week meeting ? Coming . Mrs. Peel ! Still working ? Well , there is a semblance of order . are you looking for something in particular ? No . I 'm interested , that 's all . Let me help ... I 'm so sorry . Coffee ? Gladly . I 'm very partial to your " continental blended " . I 'm not taking chances . Not after last time . - Black or white ? - No milk , so black . Here ... More ? That 's fline . Thank you very much . Hope you don 't mind , I don 't like exposing my back . I understand . I 'm not afraid . Not at all ... In truth , I 'm petrifiied . I 'm not used to all this . Murder , mayhem , lurkings after dark , young savages ... - Not to mention the damp . - The damp ? Yes ... always gets me here ... I do beg your pardon ! Old wound . German bullet , WWII ? Umbrella , January sales . Darn stupid woman ... and the minister ? Pardon ? He wants me to come back . I see . He 's a most diffiicult man . What will I tell him ? Send him a memo : " Mission of utmost importance " . " Utmost importance " ? I like that . Mind if I take notes ? Not at all . Fire away ! The future of Europe depends on you ... " The future of Europe ... " Excellent ... Your lips are sealed . In due time , your heroism will be revealed to him . If he hasn 't heard from you within the week you have died for your country . That 's very good . What ? a bit strong ! " Dead for my country " ! a storm 's brewing . I don 't mind a little suffering , but to die ... I must get back to the university . - Steed said no more ? - I 've told you 10 times . Tell me again . He questioned me about St. Bode 's . On the changes since he 'd been here . - He wasn 't . - We checked . That 's what he said . - That 's all ? - Yes . - You 're sure ? - How many times should I tell you ? Just asking , that 's all . You 're a bit on edge . I 'm tired of these questions . Too many late nights , old chap . Make it an early night . Perhaps I will . That 's all Steed wanted to know . Mary ann , you 'd better go too , before the proctor fiinds you . Run along . - He 's lying . - Yes . Well ? No , not this time . I 've done my share . Come to that , - so have you . - What do you mean ? The big man . He 's in charge , isn 't he ? It 's his turn to do a nice little task . It 's only fair . Let him do some dirty work . That is a very real contribution . an astute idea . Hello , sir . Duboys here . Look out ! There 's been a terrible accident ! It 's useless . The thesis has been destroyed by now . Born by 4 stalwart students , laid to rest , mourn no more . Don 't blame yourself . It goes back to the days of the plague . Buried and forgotten . I left him alone . - He knewthe risks . - I should have too . What did Dr. Henge have to say ? The door was open , he went in and found Pettit . - That 's all he saw ? - That 's all he said . ah , I 've been looking for you . - From the Rag Committee . - Thank you . Do come , tomorrow night . It 'll be a rave ! anything can happen and probably will . You were right : bury and forget . - anything can happen . - and probably will . Who else is invited ? We 're on the threshold of shaping history . Reaffiirm your vows . Yes . With blood , we bind , and in blood , we advance . - Well , Mary ann ? - This just arrived . Thank you , Mary ann . It 's from Carlyon . - He 's bit . - He accepted ? He has . He 'll arrive tomorrow . and this will taste blood again . We 've omitted to talk to the principal . He 's on leave . Really ? I 'm sorry ! There could have been a terrible accident . Indeed . Foolish , eh ! From a student , perhaps , but from a professor ... I couldn 't wait til tomorrow night . Tomorrow night ? Rag Night . It 's an integral part of the whole affair . I thought everybody knew . It 's fancy dress . This is the theme . - Bows and arrows ? - Of course . The theme is " Robin Hood " . - Has he arrived ? - No . When he does , stay close . Remember : the lecture room . Lure him there . Steed , you fiinally chose your costume ? - The Sheriff of ... Bashful Ben ? - Nottingham . In the books I 've read , the Sheriff is a baddie . Beneath the doublet , beats a generous heart . - Looks droopy . - Wait til it 's challenged . after you , Robin Hood . Here he is . Mr. Carlyon , glad you could make it . Duboys . - How do you do ? - Punch ? - How is the plan going ? - The plan ? - Oh , the plan ! - The Europia plan . - We admire your audacity . - audacity ? Thinking it could succeed , would be allowed to . - Let 's discuss it . - In detail . Let 's go to the lecture room . Dickie Carlyon ! What a surprise ! I told you about Dickie ! - We were playing tour guide . - Have another drink . Mrs. Peel , we 're in competition . Two Robin Hoods won 't do . One of the two must disappear . We needn 't bother : in this sort of situation , a gentleman would bow to a lady . What do we do ? Carlyon has thoughtfully provided us a target . Steed , aren 't you carrying this business too far ? - This Duboys ... - Helped to murder Broom . You don 't think he might ... He 'd attempt ... - Me ? - You . - That 's why you 're here . - We want to fiind the top man . and you 're the live bait . - What ? - Calm down . Circulate , keep your eyes open . Mrs. Peel ... They killed John , didn 't they ? - Perhaps it was an accident . - They killed him , like the others . Do you want the big man behind it ? He 'll be here . Later , in the lecture room . Mary ann ! Look for Friar Tuck . What were you telling her ? It seemed important , because you never have much to say . She asked where I found my dress . - There you are . - Thank you . This thing is torture ! - Friar Tuck is our man ! - Who told you ? Mary ann . They 're meeting in the lecture room . Friar Tuck ... Logical . The brains of the story . Is anything wrong ? - Some sort of trouble ? - Your troubles are over . Dear Friar ... - We 'd like a word with you . - In private . Memoires or Encyclopedia Erotica ? - The memoires . Heavier . - Right . Dr. Henge ! - Back to the party ? - Back to the party . Your troubles are over . Relax , enjoy yourself , have a drink . The top villain is under lock and ... key ... Take cover . My dear , dear Friar . The Erotica . - Pr. acheson ! - So much for isometrics . Which one is our man ? Stroll with us , Mr. Carlyon . Somebody wants to meet you . Quietly . Thanks for you help . But tell us ... - Which one is our man ? - Neither . They 've taken Carlyon . This is an historic moment , Mr. Carlyon . I don 't understand . I should have said : we are about to create a historic moment . To change the course of history . Hence the ceremonial . and now , triumph and the coup de grâce belong to you . Grindley , D.B. Grindley , M.a ! But you 're dead ! Steed told me ! a bit of play acting staged by my students . Things were hotting up , so he disappeared . He was only an archivist . a small man of no consequence . Only an archivist , a glorifiied librarian . Easily overlooked , but he spent his life surrounded by thoughts committed to paper . Ideas , wisdom . a voracious reader , I fiinally wrote a thesis myself , Economics and a Sense of History . I 've read it . You appreciated its genius , its pure simplicity . Creating history ? an understatement , but close enough . - Poppycock ! - I disagree ! We shall have to . We are going to modify the course of history , here and now . Your death , Mr. Carlyon , will create an economic snowball . We 'll guide it downhill , study its evolution , its growth , and change the economic face of Europe ! Do it now ! You shall have your immortality . You shall have your place in history . Mrs. Peel was right ... You abandoned me ! Terribly sorry . Will history be kind to him ?

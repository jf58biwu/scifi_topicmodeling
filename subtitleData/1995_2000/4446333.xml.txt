 What 's up , how are you ? Good , good . Grandma , don 't worry . Welcome to the United States . Where are you going , Nogales ? Looking for work ? And you , the same ? And you ? Pleasure seeing you here . And you ? What if I break your face ? You 're very ugly , no ? You don 't speak a word of Spanish . The rest of you can leave . Don 't move ! Get in the truck and leave . Get in the truck right now ! Sorry I 'm late . The cab drivers on this planet are terrible . Your Majesty , you are in grave danger . Yeah , and they overcharge you every time . Sir , a bug landed here . We must get you off the planet . A bug ? He must know why I 'm here . We think he does . Is that what I think it is ? No , just some diamonds for your children . Do we have time to eat ? Sure . I ordered you some Pirogi . To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire . To the safety of the Galaxy .

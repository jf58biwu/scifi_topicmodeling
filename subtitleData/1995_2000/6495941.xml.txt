 Just a routine background check . Now , to the best of your knowledge has Mr. Wisnowski ever used any illegal drugs ? Which illegal drugs ? Yeah , in the time that you worked with ... Ms. Ermentrout did you find her to be a trustworthy person ? Punctual . Punctual is good . No , no , ma 'am . This is just a routine background check . Mr ... Mr. Garber is not in any legal trouble whatsoever . Yeah . Okay . Thanks for your time . Hey , Scully , maybe if we get really lucky next time they 'll let us clean toilet bowls . - You ready to quit ? - No . That would make way too many people way too happy . Scully . I 'm on my way . I 've been called into Kersh 's office . Just me . Just you ? Don 't forget your toilet brush . No . No , ma 'am , not you . - Agent . - Sir . Dana Scully , this is Agent Peyton Ritter with the Bureau 's New York office . - Agent Ritter . - Hi . Show her what you have . Uh , well , our office is currently updating its case filing system . While I was involved in this project ; scanning old crime scene photographs into the computer , I came across this . Margareta Stoller , age 57 , cause of death an overdose of Nitraz ... - Take a look at when they found her . - A neighbor called the police at 11 : 14 p.m. So what 's wrong with that picture ? The clock says that it 's 45 minutes earlier . Well , a clock can be wrong . They certainly can . So , I checked the Post from the following day . These are straight from their photo files . Almost an hour and a half later . Two different negatives , same photographer . The guy 's name is Alfred Fellig . He 's rattled around Manhattan for years . Apparently a stringer for the wire services and on-call guy for NYPD . And you suspect this man Fellig ? You think that Mrs. Stoller wasn 't a suicide ? This guy 's into taking pictures , right ? So I 'm thinking , what if ... what if he poisons this woman and gets his jollies by snapping a few of her dead body then winds up back in the same apartment an hour later , after Midtown North calls him over to do the job . - That 's quite a theory . - Yeah . Well , the thing of it is he might have done it on more than one occasion . Now , I sifted through probably 2,000 of his police photos . Now , these three have measurable solar shadows . And since we know the location in each case ... - You can tell the time of day by the shadows . - Right . And with it , these three are looking every bit as hinky . You 've got another suicide here , a heart attack and a very obvious murder for which another man was convicted . - There 's no consistent MO . - There 's no consistent anything . I could sure use your help . - Agent , would you step outside , please . - Sure . I would say he has a promising career . So did you ... at one time . With your expertise in forensic pathology you would be a substantial asset to this investigation . - I know it would provide more challenge to you than running background checks . - Agent Mulder and I will begin immediately . Agent Mulder 's a lost cause . I 'm taking the chance you 're not . It 's you and Ritter . Do not let me down . - Mulder ... - Hmm ? - What are you doing ? - Being nosy . Eating my heart out . They 're sending you on an X-File . - It 's not an X-File . - That 's not what I 'm reading . I 'm thinking murder by telekinesis . I 'm thinking maybe a shamanistic death touch . I 'm thinking about the Muslim superstition that to photograph someone is to steal their soul . Thank you . All very helpful . - So they 're splitting us up , huh ? - No . - No ? - This is a one-time thing . Who told you that ? Obviously , if you do a good job they 're not going to stick you back here . Right ? Agent Scully we 're all set . - Peyton Ritter , this is Fox Mulder . - It 's a pleasure to meet you , Fox . A pleasure to meet you ... Peyton . - We should get going . - Off to New York . Alfred Fellig , what can you tell us about him ? What 's to tell ? He 's one of about 10,000 people in town who have an official license to piss people off . Well , he sometimes doubles as a crime scene photographer for your precinct . Yeah , he comes in , snaps a picture . Keeps to himself . There 's not much in the way of personal information there . There 's not supposed to be . It 's just a yearly renewal form . Would you happen to know when the original background check was done ? Here he is again . Yearly renewal dating back to January , 1970 but still no original . I think I 've got it . 1964 . Old-timer . Anything interesting ? Maybe . - What you doing ? - Take a look at this . 1996 ... ' 87 ... ' 85 ... ' 73 ... The guy 's a regular Dick Clark . I don 't know what to tell you , Dana . Other than the fact that this guy 's always been a geezer , this is looking like a dead end . Help ! Help ! Somebody call the police ! Man , what do you want from me ? Are you crazy ? Please ! Help me , please ! Come on lady , please ! Help me ! Man , what do you want from me , man ? No ! No no no no ! The prints are Alfred Fellig 's . Positive match right off his 1964 background check . I took the liberty of slipping them into the SAFIS database . First thing this morning , boom ! Up they came . You 're thinking this was Fellig 's work ? It 's a lock . The wound measurements match with the knife . I 'd say he got pretty sloppy in his old age . What 's this ? - A whole lot of blood . - Yeah . I got that . - It 's pretty clear he took a second victim . - Where 's the second body ? - They found your boy . - Fellig ? Where ? - Home watching TV . They 're bringing him in now . - Yes ! Check . Check . January 4 , 11 : 36 a.m. 15th precinct , Manhattan . Agents present : Dana Scully and Peyton Ritter . Initial interview with ... Alfred Fellig . Hello . You 're a photographer . I 've seen , uh ... seen some of your work . You , uh ... specialize in some pretty dark subject matter . You 're , uh ... you 're around death a lot . It must ... it must fascinate you . Am I ... boring you , Mr. Fellig ? Ask me a question already . All right . I want to know how you always happen to be Johnny-on-the-spot every time somebody dies . You 're always there to take the picture . How does that happen ? I have a ... a nose for news . Mr. Fellig your fingerprints were found on a murder weapon at a crime scene . Could you give us a full accounting of your activities last night ? The Bronx . I was on the job . Saw some jibone stealing a kid 's tennis shoes . He chased me . Ran off . He ran off ? Some ... unidentified murderer . - I guess I could identify him . - Your fingerprints were found on the knife . How did they get there ? He left the knife behind . I guess I touched it ... briefly . Why would you do that ? Were you injured Mr. Fellig ? You seem to be in pain . Were you attacked ? We found other blood at the crime scene and , when we have it tested I 'm wondering if we 're going to learn that it 's yours . - I got cut some . - May we see ? May I help you ? Hey . Hey , take Mr. Fellig to get his blood drawn . Photograph his back , too . Hey , I 'm confused . I thought we were trying to bust this guy not look for reasons to let him go . I thought we were looking for the truth . Scully . Hi . My name is Fox Mulder . We used to sit next to each other at the FBI . - How 's your X-File coming ? - Mulder , it 's not ... We haven 't made much headway . We arrested Alfred Fellig and we just released him . - You can 't hold him ? What about the stabbing ? - How do you know about that ? I told you I 'm nosy . Why are you letting him go ? Well , we were able to pull another set of prints off of the knife . They belong to a convicted murderer by the name of Malcolm Wiggins . That and the fact that Fellig 's blood was found all over the crime scene tells me that his story checks out . At least that particular story , anyway . But you still think Fellig 's a murderer , huh ? I don 't know what to think . He 's , uh unusual . As in he , uh , plugs up like a cork when you stab him ? Mulder , where are you getting this stuff ? Well , young man Ritter has been sending progress reports to Kersh . My computer may have inadvertently intercepted a few of those . He 's got nice things to say about you , though ... mostly . Why don 't you let me do a little background check on Fellig for you ? - Mulder ... - Come on . It 's , you know ... it 's what I do now . I 'm getting good at it . I 'm parked around the block . Fellig 's asleep . I haven 't seen him move in over four hours . Have a lovely evening . Mr. Fellig , open up , please ! Explain this . - What ? - You took that photo an hour before police arrived . You then purposely covered up that fact by photographing the scene again . I don 't think I remember that one . You have , Mr. Fellig , a long and uncanny history of being the first person at the scene of a death . You also have a history of covering up that fact . Why ? - Am I under arrest again ? - Are you a murderer ? Well , then explain yourself , sir . Because , I promise you until you do , you will not get a moment 's peace . You want to take a ride with me ? You come with me . I 'll show you . It 's been an hour . - Are we going to drive around all night ? - Yeah . This is it . This is what I do . Looking for the shot . - What shot ? - The shot . Her . She 's about to die . What are you talking about ? It could happen in the next minute , in the next hour but it 'll happen . It 's as plain as day . Look , Mr Fellig , I don 't know what you 're planning but nobody here is going to die . I 'm not planning anything . I 'm just here to tell you what 's going to happen . That ... that woman right there is going to be murdered ? I didn 't say " murdered . " She 's a smoker . She might die of lung cancer . The " how " is always a surprise . I ... I just always know " when . " You want me to believe that ? Get out of my face . Get off me ! FBI ! Don 't move ! - Damn , man ! Where 'd you come from ? - Shut up ! - Get down ! Back up ! - You 're not such a big man now ! That gun ain 't mine , Red . - You all right ? - I 'm out of here . Dana , what the hell is going on ? Assault and possession of an unregistered handgun . I 'll be with you in a minute . - Why didn 't you call me sooner ? - I apologize . What , you blew off the surveillance ? No offense , but the surveillance was blown before I got there . So , wait , wait ... you blew off the surveillance and what , took a little joyride with him ? I confronted Fellig . I questioned him further about his involvement ... - ... in the deaths that he photographed . Is that okay with you ? - What did he say ? He said that he can tell when people are about to die . Look , if New York passes a Good Samaritan law we might be able to nail him on that but other than that , I doubt we 're going to get him for murder . Wrong . Let me show you something . They picked up Mr. Wiggins last night . Now , he says that it was Fellig who killed that kid in the alley , not him . He said he just happened along and ... - ... he had to fight for his life . - A convicted murderer half Fellig 's age . He said he would have come in on his own but he said he was afraid we wouldn 't have believed him . He 's right . Tell me , Ritter , did he have any help concocting that story ? Look , Fellig is a murderer . Whether or not he did this specific one , I don 't care , not if it buys me a few days in the box with him . - No judge is going to issue a warrant based on this . - No , no , no . I know the judge . We 'll have it by noon . - You know , Kersh warned me about you . - Uh , he did ? Yeah ... you and your partner . God knows his reputation precedes him so I guess I should have seen this coming . You muck up my case , and Kersh 'll hear about it . Are we clear , Dana ? Scully . And we 're done with this conversation . Yeah ? Hey , Scully , uh , how 's that X-File coming ? And before you tell me that it 's not an X-File ... It is . - What happened ? - Alfred Fellig seems to know an awful lot about death . Oh , yeah ? Well , that 's not surprising , given that he 's reached the ripe old age of 149 . - Excuse me ? - I did a little low-tech background check on him . This stuff is so old that they don 't even keep it on record on the computer but Alfred Fellig doesn 't exist before 1964 but one Henry Strand does . He applied for a press pass from the Jersey City police in 1939 at the age of 53 . His prints match Fellig 's . But Mulder , that must be some kind of a mistake . You think ? Because this Henry Strand does not exist before 1939 . However , one L.H. Rice is on record as having sat for the New York State civil service exam . Now , the records don 't show whether he passed or not but his thumbprint ? Fellig 's . Want to know what L.H. Rice 's birthday is ? April 4 , 1849 . I 'm not good at math , but I 'm figuring that 's a whole lot of candles on the cake . I have spent time with this man and-and he can 't be more than 65 years old . I-I think that 's what he wants you to think . Now we 're talking about a guy for whom the phrase " life in prison " carries some seriously weighty connotations . I think you should get to him before he vanishes and becomes someone else . You are going to be arrested , Mr. Fellig , in two hours , charged with murder , and this time you won 't be able to just change your name . I showed you what I do last night . I just take the pictures . What you showed me was a contemptible lack of compassion for another human being . You showed me that you profit of people 's deaths . Now , why shouldn 't you go to prison ? What , do you want me to cry for them ? You want me to make like I feel sorry for them ? I don 't . Lucky bastards . - Every one of them . - " Lucky " ? I 'm just there to get the shot . I don 't take those people . He does . Who 's he ? That 's him . He 's the one who takes them . You 're saying that this is a photograph of Death itself ? It 's a glimpse , just a glimpse . It 's closer than I 've gotten in ... well , I-I can 't even count the years . And this is the shot that you spoke of ... this is what you try and get ? Mr. Fellig , I know ... that you know more about photography than I do but this is just a lens flare . You 're right . I do know more about photography than you do . Okay , I mean ... mmm ... For the sake of argument ... Why bother ? I mean , why ... why take a picture of Death ? So I can look into his face . So I can die . Pills don 't work . Razors ... gas ... bridges ... I can 't tell you how many bridges I 've jumped off of . All I get is wet . I got left behind . I don 't want to be here anymore . I can 't even remember a time when I did . And ... this ... This is all I know ... to do . - You know I don 't believe you . - Yes , you do . That 's why you 're here . How is it you know when people are about to die ? Oh ... You chase it long enough you pick it up . Louis Brady Photogrph . 1928 . Excuse me . Mulder . - Mulder , it 's me . - Hi . Those other two names that you said that Fellig went by ... Strand and Rice ... ? - Yeah . Henry Strand and L.H. Rice . - What about Louis Brady ? Uh , no , but there 's a ... there 's , like , a big gap before 1939 . Will you check it out for me ? I 'm sticking here to make sure he doesn 't bolt . Louis Brady , Mulder . Tell me what you find out . Mr. Fellig ? Oops . Excuse me . I have some film out . Hold on a second . Ritter . Agent Ritter , it 's Agent Mulder . Is Agent Scully there with you ? - No , she 's not . Nobody seems to able to find her . - Me neither , and D.C. Cellular says her phone is turned off . - What can I do for you , Agent ? - Well , you can find her for me . Listen , Agent Mulder , I 'm on my way to arrest Alfred Fellig . Good , because that 's where I think she is . And you were right , Fellig is a murderer . Under the name of Louis Brady , he suffocated two patients in a Connecticut hospital . He says he meant to catch up with death . One year into his prison sentence he walked off a work detail . The manhunt never officially ceased . - When was this ? - 1929 . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ... when ? - Look , Ritter , don 't sweat the math . It 's him . - Just get there and find Agent Scully . - All right . I 'm on it . You know , most people want to live forever . Most people are idiots . - Which is one of the reasons I don 't . - I think you 're wrong . How can you have too much life ? There 's too much to learn , to experience . 75 years ... is enough . Take my word for it . You live forever , sooner or later you start to think about the big thing you 're missing and that everybody else gets to find out about but you . - What about love ? - What , does that last forever ? 40 years ago I drove down to the city hall , down to the hall of records ... record archives , whatever they call it . I wanted to look up my wife . It bothered me I couldn 't remember her name . Love lasts ... 75 years , if you 're lucky . You don 't want to be around when it 's gone . Count your blessings . Why are you this way ? I mean , if this is true ... give me something in the way of proof . Help me find some science that I can hang this on . It has nothing to do with science . - Someone took my place . - Took your place ? I don 't know her name . I don 't think I ever knew it . I had yellow fever way the hell back then when it killed half of New York . Washington Square Park was a common grave they had so many bodies . They 'd bury them shallow . They wrapped them in-in yellow sheets and the yellow sheets would stick up through the mud . I was in a city-run contagion ward . I was out of my head with fever ... out of my mind . And I saw him saw Death . Wish I had a camera then . At first , I ... just saw him out of the corner of my eye . Then he got bolder and he started flitting around the room and he 'd take this person and he 'd take that person and I never saw his face . I didn 't want to see his face . I figured if I saw it , he 'd take me , too . - But he didn 't . - No . There was a nurse . She did the best she could . Back then , medical science was they couldn 't find their ass with both hands , they still can 't , but she did the best she could . She sat with me , held my hand and I was on my deathbed and he came for me . I didn 't look at him . I closed my eyes and turned my head . I didn 't tell her not to look at him . I wanted her to look at him ... I wanted her to look at him instead of me . And then I came to and the fever broke . They were carrying her out wrapped up in a yellow sheet . Since that time I realized you got to be careful what you wish for . I missed my chance . You 're very lucky , you know that ? What do you mean ? Wait a minute . Say what 's on your mind . You mean lucky like the others ? - You want me to believe that I 'm about to die ? - I just want to take the picture . You took my picture . You took my picture last night . Is this why ? - No , that was different . - I 'm not going to die ! - Turn that off . - No . - Turn it off right now ! Put it down ! - There is nothing to be done for it . You took my phone . Why ? - Please , just give me a chance . - What don 't you want me to know ? - What don 't you want me to know ! ? - He 's coming ... He 's coming ... - ... and you should just make your peace . - Shut up ! He 's here . Agent ? Oh , god . Come on ... Come on ... Dammit ! Okay , help . We need some help in here ! Do you see him ? Do you see him ? Don 't look . Close your eyes . NYU MEDICAL CENTER ONE WEEK LATER You 're a lucky man . Coroner 's report came back on Fellig . Says he died of a single gunshot wound . That 's all it said . Well , I , uh ... talked to your doctor and he says you 're doing great . You 're making the fastest recovery he 's ever seen . Yeah , Mulder , I don 't even know how I entertained the thought . - People don 't live forever . - No , no , I-I ... I think he would have . I-I just think that ... that death only looks for you once you seek its opposite .

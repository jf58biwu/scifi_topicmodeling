 Ow damn . It 's just a thorn . You should really be more careful Challenger . It 's taken us nearly two days to find Silybum Marianum . I 'm overwhelmed by your concern for my health . I 'll make a salve for your hand just as soon as ... we get the plants safely back home . Any more on your list professor ? Just one Yarrow Allheal . I think I found it . Fern like leaves and bunches of little white flowers . Eureka ! [ woman 's scream ] Rifle ! Now careful Challenger . What the hell are you doing ? Deathtrap this grove is probably full of them . Summerlee don 't move this whole place is booby trapped . Follow me step exactly where I do . You best wait here . Let her go ! No stop ! Not another inch . Oh my God Malone . How is he ? He 's dead . At the dawn of the century ... a band of adventures set out to prove the impossible ... the existence of a prehistoric world . The Visionary . The Heiress . The Hunter . The Scientist , and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime ... Stranded in a savage land . Befriended by an untamed beauty . Together they fight to survive . In this amazing world of lost civilizations ... and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home . A way out of ... the Lost World It 's Curare . I can save him , there 's not much time . Then get to it ! Challenger . There 's nothing we can do , if there 's any chance . If he dies , you die . He 's breathing , I can 't believe it . I can do no more for him now we must take him to the village . What are you doing with that ? Drinking it . Take it off . Excuse me ? My father 's jacket , take it off now . If you 'll recall I sacrificed my silk jacket for Challengers electric generator surely you wouldn 't begrudge me a little pleasure . It 's not yours . It 's been sitting in the trunk gathering moths for what ... eleven years . It 's not he 's was using it . Take it off or I 'll cut it off . My , my ... daddy 's little girl 's all grown up . Will he make it ? I will not let him die . And what about the woman in labor ? I 've stopped her labor for the moment ... Asu will rest and pray until her time . You 've left the women alone ? It 's a sacred place well protected as your friend has learned . Relax ... it makes no sense for him to revive Malone and then try to kill us . What doesn 't make sense is Malone rising from the dead . Well , do you have a better explanation ? Maybe the darts were only a tranquilizer . You think he 's leading us into an ambush . Our hands are on the stretcher instead of our guns . We 're there . I don 't see any village . You know how to look but you don 't yet know how to see . My word . Get one thing straight ... put a knife to my throat again you ... better finish the job . What are you gonna do shoot me ? Live by the sword . - Don 't press your luck . - Shhhh ... don 't move ... - ... behind you . - Where ? On the path ... a Herrerasaur and he looks hungry . Can we make it to the treehouse ? Could this day get any better ? They hunt in packs . Of course they do . Follow me on three : One . Two . Three . This way ! An entire village in the trees . And the only way out is fifty feet straight down . - It was an accident . - Was it ? How is he , Summerlee ? Pale , feverish ... I can hardly feel a pulse . Malone ? And you say all Lento did was lay hands on him ? There was a strange light . An aura . What are you two talking about ? The body 's electric charge . Perhaps Lento manipulated it in some way ... changed the polarity of the neural endings . He 's fading . Do something Summerlee . I 'm a botanist for heaven sake not a faith healer . All right take it easy . Malone 's dying and I haven 't a clue how to help him . I do . His life is not your concern . We poisoned him our dart ... when all he wanted was to help Asu . I can 't let him die . Damn right you can 't . As village elder I forbid it . Think of the village think of the baby . I do . You know as well as I. There must be harmony before the child enters the world ... to let this man die at our hands . If you can save him ... you 'd better be fast he won 't last much longer . I 'll be fine ... your friend will be too . Surrender your pain . Now is not your time . Come back ! Look at me ! - Look at me ! - Enough you need to rest . Not yet ! Look at me ! He saved Malone . And destroyed himself , you don 't know what you 've done . I think I 've missed a step . It 's better than being dinner . Only just , that 's the last time I play follow the leader with you . I 'll get us out of here . Sounds fair you did get us in . Lento . What are you doing ? Yura ... you have nothing to fear from me . I am what I was , nothing has changed . You were the best of us . Your memory will be honored . Come on , there 's work to be done . Who is going to bring the new shaman into the world ? Not you . I am your healer . I am your friend . No , you are what destroyed my friend . I have given my life for this village ... my soul . And now you repay me ... with murder . Released me ! You know what is in me . I will make you suffer ... every horror my hands have ever touched . I will rip your beating heart from your chest ... and fill it with an eternity of agony . Yura ! Yura ! Come on it 's time to go . Wait ! How is he ? - He 's finished . - Finished ? There must be something you can do for him ? Yes there is . We will kill him . You buy this ? They believe all sickness is caused by evil . They actually think he 's been taken over by demons . No , not quite not taken over ... just filled . Not you too ? You were dying now you 're not . But if that 's true then it is my fault . He 's gonna die because of me . It is not your fault . If I hadn 't rushed into the grove . And if the woman hadn 't of screamed ... if the darts hadn 't of been poisoned . And if I hadn 't of told him to save you . Too many ifs my friend . Malone ... I didn 't know it was going to be your life for his . And if you had ? So you have no medicines at all ? No herbal remedies ? We have no need . For generations there has always ... been a shaman to take on the illness of the village . Until now . Asu 's child will be born at moon rise . He is destined to become the greatest of our healers . What about Lento ? It was the healers bargain ... every gift has its price . So it would seem . Lento knew that one day he might overflow with the evil inside him . Believe me ... whatever is left of his soul ... is welcoming the release that death will bring . No one welcomes death . That 's not our decision to make . So we 're just gonna stand around and do nothing while they murder him ? Lento sacrificed himself for his people . Not really so different from a certain carpenter ... who gave his life for our souls . I need to be higher . I 'm trying . Higher ! This is as high as I go . Almost got it , a little more . A little more ? There is no more . - Where is it ? - What ? Where 's what ? Oh you poor thing . Did that big bad lady frighten you ? What the hell are you doing ? It 's a Scarlet King he 's perfectly harmless ... the jungle 's full of them . Doesn 't mean you treat him like family . No sense you being trapped down here with us . There 's enough snakes down here already . If you insist on feeding the wild animals ... they 'll never learn to fend for themselves . You could be up there with them . Oh , no , no , no No I prefer being stuck down a twenty foot hole ... with you . Never had a sister to share cherished moments with . You look better . Good as new thanks to you . If it weren 't for our dart you wouldn 't have needed me . You 're trying to help Asu weren 't you ? You 're a hero . Some hero . I wanted to say I 'm sorry . For what ? It was my illness , my evil . You think it overwhelmed me ? Yura said ... Do you really have that much evil in you ? Yura has been waiting for a chance like this for months now . - Why ? - The child his powers will eclipse mine ... or those of any healer we 've seen for generations . But first he must be guided , trained . Whoever controls the shaman controls the village . My friends and I will get you out of here . At least there 's a healer who will follow me . Maybe he 'll be strong enough to resist Yura . I 'll never know . I won 't let them kill you . - If it is my time to die ? - It 's not . It 's not your time to die . Relax , when the dinosaurs get hungry they 'll go hunt somewhere else . Until then we wait . Assuming we don 't starve to death . That won 't happen . Really ? No ! No water , we 'll die of thirst first . I 'll get us out of here . You 'll just have to do something I imagine is difficult for you . What 's that ? Trust me . We are forever grateful for your sacrifice . In every age your name will be whispered with reverence . Lento ! Goodbye old friend . No ! Demon ! Lento ! Lento ! What have you done with Malone ? Your friend will stay here until it is time . Time , time for what ? For his death . He 's still sick , he 's feverish . He thought you were hanging an innocent man . We 'll take him away . You 'll never see us again . I 'm sorry but the child foretold to be our next shaman will be born at moonrise tonight . Balance must be restored before the birth ... a life for a life . We could take him by force if necessary . You 'd have to kill every one of us to do so . I don 't believe you 're that kind of man . He didn 't kill that woman Lento did . That woman was my granddaughter and Lento is not here . Then we 'll return him . You 'll die . He has powers beyond healing . He will use the jungle against you . We 're wasting time . If he 's as dangerous as you say , we 'll need Malone . We 'll need all the help we can get . No I can 't risk you not returning . A life for a life . I believe I may have a solution . What 's going on ? Did they find him ? Not yet that is your job . I 'm free ! Summerlee how the hell did you do that ? You 're a genius . What are you doing let him out ! I 'm afraid that is the bargain ... Yura felt that you 'd be more help in hunting Lento then I. But someone had to remain in your place ... quite practical really . Not gonna hang you ? Oh , yes that is the idea . Unless of course you can bring Lento back by moon rise . Summerlee , I can 't let you die because of me . Then I suggest you hurry . What a waste ... that was the last of my bubble bath from Harrods . - You 're amazing . - Hey . if you had learned how to share we wouldn 't be down this hole right now . You knew that jacket was my father 's ... you did it deliberately . You 're delusional . You don 't have enough stuff of your own ? You have to go steal my father 's clothes . That 's why you did it ... you 're jealous . Now you 're raving , probably claustrophobic . It 's because I knew my parents . I can remember my mother and father and you ... I can 't . Score one for you ... just my luck to get stuck with Freud of the jungle . Personally I think families are overrated . I 've always done just fine on my own ... more than fine . Drop me anywhere on this earth I 'll survive . I don 't need parents . I don 't need anyone . Maybe we 're not so different after all . I must have bubble bath on the brain . I swear I can hear running water . - What ? - Shhhh . What are you doing ? It 's an underground stream . This hole was a working well at one time . You wanna get out of here ? Here 's your chance , start digging . Welcome my friend . Not a mark on him . How the hell did Lento do this ? - This way . - Looks like he went through here . Wait . This way too . He wants us to split up . We 're running out of time . I don 't think we have a choice . Each of us will have to take a trail . Not even a shaman can be three places at once . Fire a shot if you see him then wait for the others . Don 't take any chances we don 't need any dead heroes . Besides ruining my nails I don 't know what good this is doing . Look at the rest of the wall Marguerite . Its clay and limestone , these rocks are granite . Somebody put them here . On purpose ? Somebody had too much time on their hands . They put them here to dam up a working well . Even if it 's an underground stream at least we 'll have fresh water . If it 's a river ... Now what we drown ? No , we float . Keep your hands where I can see them . That 's close enough . Calm now , - I have no weapons - One more and your dead . For heaven 's sake where do you think I 'm going to go , trust up like a chicken ? I 'm sorry we must repay my granddaughter life . - Try to relax . - Easy now . What are you doing to that woman ? - Nothing . - That 's obvious and dangerous . Her labors stalled and if you don 't help her you 're going to lose them both . We will be doing something . You can kill me right away and risk that child needlessly dying , or you can let me help Asu . You can always kill me later . My eyes . Don 't be afraid ... I am Lento the healer . I take on the misery of the world . No one will supplant me . Let me help you . That is how I feel now , constantly day and night . That is how I will feel for the rest of my life . When it 's too much tell me , and I 'll make it stop forever . It 's alright , Challenger , it 's us . - Are you all right ? - I can 't see , I 'm blind . Any better ? I 'm fine , fine . Really ? - How many fingers am I holding up ? - Three . Sorry . Enough games . We can 't leave you here . And we can 't give up on Summerlee either . Dammit we 're running out of time . Even if we catch Lento , we won 't make it back to the village before moon rise . Moon rise the baby . Lento said no one would supplant him . He must have meant the baby . He 's circling back to the grove . Where are you going ? After Lento . Oh no ... not alone . Somebody 's gotta stay here with Challenger - I need to finish this . - And if he kills you ? Well then it will be your turn . Just be careful Malone . The whole grove is full of booby traps . I know . Just slow him down we 'll try to get back to the altar before him . Just protect the child . Have you ever killed anyone before ? I was in the war . Answer the question . I 've seen death . You 're just a reporter Malone ... killing an animal is very different then killing a human being . To look him in the eye know you are about to end his life ... Just remember , Lento , he isn 't human anymore . Is this it ? No Black Cohosh , this , this is Black Cohosh . I need more of it I need as much of it as you can find . There 's some in our own balloon please bring it all here . - Okay . - She 's dying . No she 's dehydrating . Where 's the water ? Good , good , make sure she drinks . What if it doesn 't fill up all the way ? We 'll be stuck treading water in a freezing wet hole . As long as we can float high enough to reach those . Then we can climb the rest of the way . What ? Oh nothing . What are you doing ? Seeing if our friends are waiting for us . Looks like the coast is clear . Is this what you 're looking for ? Is that the best you can do ? It 's good enough . Please ... help me . You did this to me . I gave my life for yours . Help me ! - I 'm sorry . - No . It was the only way . But you gave me life . And you have given me back ... my soul . - I 'll go get some help . - There 's no time . Thank you . Well that was an adventure . That was a great save thanks . Consider us even . How do you figure that ? Hey ! Coral snake very pretty also very deadly . If you hadn 't grabbed it before it reached me . I thought you said it was harmless you know the jungles full of them . Scarlet King is harmless ... the Coral snake on the other hand is lethal . It 's an easy mistake to make ... for beginners . There this should help a bit . Is that any better ? Good enough . Thanks . Where is he ? I want to see the baby . You mean this baby ? The new shaman , your new healer . He must be a handsome fellow . Yes , SHE is . HE , is a beautiful little girl .

Hunt these aliens . You vengeance . It 's more than that . Really ? You know , Nick , maybe you and Sammy , you are not as different as you think . Eddie , how 's federal those reports ? Broken man . Mitchum Jack went to the industrial complex of cobalt four times in the last two weeks . Any idea what he was doing there ? - Hey , man , you are a genius , not a magician . Thanks , buddy . Hey , I got an e-mail . Search results based on photos . Picture was compared with known criminals . No results . - Shit . - I told you . I have a message . - Bingo ! - Ce e ? My informant bound on Mitchum . In one of the recent killings . It means that we can get a warrant . Finally we can check his business . - Oh , God ! - You report . - Are you - and Ce ? Have some ketchup on his face . Where are you going , Sammy ? - What kind of place is this ? - It seems he 's a truck center . I have two . It 's like in the fridge here . This way . Let 's see what download . Come on . My God ! Are they dead ? No . They are human clones that alien host and waits . - Let 's get out of here . - Sammy Kozack ! I 'd say it 's your lucky day . I 'm impressed , Sammy . You and your friend have managed to find us . Yes , and now we will look at you as you dissolve , punk . Hey , Sammy . - He 's right . Play with guns , it would be foolish . Both have be killed . What 's the point ? You know who you have set . That attitude is why I thought it must kill you . You put in operation Mitchum , but now I think that that attitude is what it lacked Mitchum . What would you think if I told you that I would leave alive - Do you accept some conditions ? - I urinate on your terms . What conditions ? What do you want ? Our organization needs access to the things your family controls for years . Transport routes , docks , railways ... Am I close ? Very well . We need to transport the goods , so to say , without being followed , or to draw attention . Join us ! Reward will make you richer than drugs , prostitution or gambling . Kiss me . That 's the thing , Sammy . Give your new family loyalty and enrich yourself than you ever dreamed . I will come at dawn . If you accept the offer , We inspect a walk and shipping ... Do not bother to come here , we 'll be long gone . And if I refuse ? You will not refuse . E office . It 's there for hours . He said he should think . Foster , are between Sammy and Gua fool . Stop playing and get the hell out of there . Carry clones across the country , Eddie . I think it is mobilized for the second wave . There will be other opportunities . Run ! Stay alive to fight another day . I can not risk . When you say he does not want to be disturbed , he means it . - He shot people for less . - I do not doubt . But we still have to see it . Know what is going . I know what is going . Sammy ... always takes care of his . Are you sure ? Are . Sammy ? - Get out of here , Sophia ! What are you doing ? - What do you think ? I 'll meet them . - Accept the offer ? - I do what I must do . I 'm a businessman . That 's the deal . I thought Sammy Kozack , never gives back . To fight with other villains , is one . The aliens , it 's something else . If we now can do better understanding . I can not let you do that , Sammy . - I like you , kid . Do not make me have to kill you . What happened to care for your people , Sammy ? That guy caught bullets with his bare hands , Sophie . I 'm still a fighter , but not stupid . - You sell , Sammy . - I am a survivor . If you join them , you get nothing . Get out ! Sammy , nu ! You were lucky , man ! No ! I can not let him do that . It will help to defeat humanity . - Not realize what it does . - It 's your choice . It 's Sammy . - Sammy , think ! - I thought . I 'll be back . Make sure this guy disappears . Get it . Anyway it does not matter . Sammy ! Thanks for coming to meet us . - I 'm leaving town . - So we say goodbye ? Yes . It is hard to imagine what will happen with this . I look at these people , and I would like to say . - But ... - I understand . What to do ? Now not bad , but it was even better . Never look back . Now even you can sleep peacefully knowing that Sammy did the right thing . - What do you mean ? - I underestimated Sammy . The bomb in the briefcase . He gave his life to not fall into the hands of aliens . Now we have more chances to survive . I loved him . Sophia planted the bomb that killed Sammy ? If so , maybe it was a gesture of love for a man , said that rather die than give back . Why did Sammy to make a deal with the devil ? It is human nature to save yourself the expense of others ? Whatever the response , such a betrayal , fills me with fear . Because I know that the second wave is coming . Translation and adaptation AdyC

 Previously on " Lost " ... We were together for only one week . They came . They came and took her . Alex ... They took my baby . Somebody , please help me ! He had this- - this thing , like- - like a needle , and he stabbed me with it . He was trying to hurt my baby . We got a problem . The manifest- - the names of everyone who survived- - I interviewed everyone . One of them isn 't in the manifest ... Hello there . Ethan . I think they 've been taken . Claire ! I don 't remember Ethan . I don 't remember what he did to me . Help me ! Don 't believe a word he says ! He 's one of them . I have no idea what she 's talking about . For a long time , he will lie . I don 't know why you 're asking me all these questions . This is all a mistake . Tell me the truth ! Tell me who you are ! What if he 's telling the truth , John ? What if he 's not ? Hey . Hey , it 's okay , sweetie . Shh . Hey , sweetie , it 's all right . - John ? John ? Wake up . - What , Claire ? What ? He 's burning up , and he 's got a rash . And I need to find Jack . He 's , uh , he 's on shift at the hatch . - Okay . - Uh , uh , no , Claire , wait . - Claire , wait . - No , I can 't , John , okay ? No , no , no . You 're not walking through the jungle in the middle of the night . I 'll go get Jack . I 'll send him right back here . - Okay . - Don 't worry . Jack . What 's going on ? The baby 's got a fever . - A fever ? - Claire was coming here . - He asleep ? - Not a sound all night . I 'll get back here as soon as I can . Shh . Hey , hey , sweetie , it 's okay . It 's okay . Mommy 's just gonna cool you down , okay ? Okay ? Shh . It 's okay . Jack ? What are you doing here ? You stay away from us ! He 's infected , isn 't he ? What ? Your child- - he 's sick . Just get away . You get away from us ! You don 't remember , do you ? It 's a vaccine . We don 't want him to get sick . Hey , get back ! Get away from her ! What do you think you 're doing here ? What are you doing here ? Just get out of our camp . What happened ? What did she say ? She said there 's something wrong with him . It 's just not like him . He always sleeps through the night . And this rash- - I mean , there 's something wrong . Babies get sick , Claire . Okay , what about the fever and cough ? Perfectly normal . And he hasn 't been eating at all , and- - Claire , he 's okay . It 's probably roseola . It 's a typical virus that 's common in children his age , and the rash is a sign of it . Okay . What if it 's not ? What if he caught something really bad ? Like some kind of infection ? Infection ? Where did you get that idea ? Rousseau was here . What did she say to you ? She said she knew he was sick , okay ? That he 's infected . Claire , there is no infection . We 've been on this island for two months , and no one 's gotten sick . Rousseau 's crazy . We 're gonna let the fever just run its course . It 's gonna be fine , okay ? Trust me . I 've gotta get back to the hatch . And I 'll come back in a couple hours and check on him again , okay ? - Okay ? - Yeah . Hey , I 'm sure that if there was something wrong , Jack would know . Are you sure about this ? We don 't really know her . I think she can help me . Hey . Hey , guys . So you 're a shrink , right ? I 'm a clinical psychologist , but " shrink " works , too . Can you help people remember things ? I guess it depends on what you need to remember . So it was our second week on the island . I was out in the jungle , and I- - I thought I was having the baby . Charlie was with me . And there was this man- - Ethan . We thought he was one of us from the plane , but he wasn 't . So he took me- - he took both of us . And ... I don 't remember . I don 't remember anything . When Jack and I found Charlie , he was hanging from a tree by his neck . I have no idea what happened , and now I 'm seeing these flashes of things . And , you know , I have amnesia . There 's two weeks missing from my life . Claire , I don 't think you have amnesia . You know , sometimes when something terrible happens to us , there 's a little switch in your head that flicks on to protect us from having to deal with it . Maybe your memories aren 't gone . Maybe you 're just blocking them . Then I need you to unblock them . 'Cause my baby 's sick , and they did something to him . Do you have to go to the bathroom ? No . Well , just let us know when you do . Yeah , I 'll look forward to that . Thought you might like something to read . Dostoevsky . You don 't have any Stephen King ? The library 's a little outdated . Right . Well , thanks . What 's with the book ? Just something to pass the time . Did you know that Hemingway was jealous of Dostoevsky ? No , John , I didn 't know that . He wanted to be the world 's greatest writer but convinced himself that he could never get out from under Dostoevsky 's shadow . Kind of sad , really . What are we doing , Jack ? What are we doing ? We can 't hide him down here forever . Changing shifts around is gonna get people asking questions . I just want to know what the long-term plan is . Well , John , let me ask you this- - we don 't have a long-term plan for the button , but we keep pushing it , don 't we ? Look , until we know who he is , whether or not he 's telling the truth , we have to keep doing what we 're doing . If you 've got a better idea , let 's hear it . How about you let me go ? Now we 're away from all the noises of the camp . Just breathe . Let your whole body relax . Good . Listen to the waves . Good , in ... and out slowly . Good . Keep your eyes closed . Very relaxed , Claire . Just keep breathing . Now I want you to visualize yourself when you were pregnant . Keep listening to my voice . Think about what you see . It 's a vaccine . We don 't want him to get sick . When was your last checkup , Claire ? Oh , I haven 't been in a while . I 've been busy , and ... I 'm going to Los Angeles . - Really ? - Yeah . Traveling in your third trimester , that 's not usually recommended . Uh , there 's a family there . I 'm , uh , giving the baby up for adoption . Oh , of course . I understand . The sedative I gave you is very mild . I know these exams can be very stressful . I 'm going to give you a shot now , Claire . A little medicine for your baby . Don 't worry . You 're just gonna feel a little pinch . Aah ! It 's okay . You 're all right . It 's okay . It 's okay . It was Ethan ! I saw Ethan ! I saw him . It was Ethan ! - Claire , Claire , it 's okay . - No , it 's not ! - You 're all right . - No , I 'm not all right ! It was Ethan ! - What happened ? - I don 't know . She just- - - What did you do ? - Nothing , she just- - Do it again ! Do it again ! No , Claire , you were screaming . But I remembered , okay ? - I saw Ethan . - Claire ... He was there , and he was giving me an exam . What you saw could be combining experiences of what happened before the crash to the things that happened here on the island . No , okay , no ! This was real ! I was drugged . He did something to me . Claire , you need to calm down , all right ? It 's not good for you . You know what ? Aaron is sick , okay ? I need to find that place ! That room- - it 's real . It 's real . Okay , and there 's medicine there . For the baby . I need to find it . I need to find it . Kate , Kate , please , help me find it . Hello ? Hello ? - What 's the- - - Shh . - Hello ? - Howdy . Hello , John . You are alone ? Not anymore . - How many of you- - - Shut up . I was hoping to borrow a saw . Absolutely . Right this way . I need a gun , and you don 't get to ask why . Well , Thelma , seeing as I got all the guns , I do get to ask why . - No , you don 't . - Yes , I do . Watch . Why ? Just give me a gun , Sawyer . Check it out . I found a new pair of glasses damn near my prescription . You like ' em ? All right , I 'm going into the jungle to track down Rousseau . The french chick ? What for ? Claire thinks she knows where there might be some medicine . The baby 's sick . - Well , hell , I got medicine . - She thinks he 's really sick- - as in " quarantine " sick . What do you think ? I think she 's a little too worried . But she 's going after Rousseau with or without me . No boys allowed , huh ? All right , what do you want ? 9 millimeter or rifle ? I don 't think this is a good idea . Maybe you should listen to Jack . But what if jack 's wrong , okay ? Jack said the fever would break , and it hasn 't . He 's getting worse . Just because it hasn 't broken yet , it doesn 't- - Well , how long am I supposed to wait , Sun ? A mother should not leave her child . I 'm sorry . Are you a mother ? No ... I 'm not . Claire , are you sure you want to do this ? What did you say ? Are you sure you want to do this ? You need to be sure . You have to get out of here- - Do you have to put that in my tummy ? 'Cause it really , really hurts . I know . I wish there was another way . But the baby needs it , Claire . Okay ? Okay . There , all done . That wasn 't so bad , was it ? No . And now because you 've been such a good girl , I think it 's time for a surprise . Claire , this way . Here we go . Over here . What is this place ? - It 's for your baby , Claire . - Oh , it 's amazing . Wow . Hey ... What- - what happened to Charlie ? Charlie ? Oh , he 's fine . When we got far enough from camp , I let him go back . Oh . So where did it all come from ? Well , I 'd love to explain everything to you , Claire , but I 'm afraid it would be a little overwhelming right now . What ... Go ahead , turn it on . Ethan ? Wait here . I 'll be right back . Okay . What the hell happened ? You were supposed to make the list and then bring her in . Was I unclear ? It 's not my fault . They knew I wasn 't on the plane . They had a manifest . Well , what am I supposed to tell him ? You know what he 's gonna do when he finds out ? Damn it , Ethan . Get out . Get out of here . Claire ? Claire , are you all right ? I , um ... Ready to go ? Hey , sweetheart , shh , mommy 's gotta go now , sweetheart , okay ? Shh , don 't cry . Don 't cry . It 's okay . I 'll be back really soon . And I 'll make you feel all better , okay ? I promise . Thanks . Okay . - You okay ? - Yeah . Are you sure this is her trail ? We started at the exact spot where we chased her off the beach . So what do you know about Rousseau ? Not much . You spent all that time with her when you went out to " the Black Rock . " You must have talked about something . Just about her ship crashing here- - her and her research team getting stranded . What happened to them ? They died . How ? Tracks are gone . Trail ends here . Kate , how did they die ? She killed them . What ? - Why- - why would she- - - Because they were infected . You believe me now , don 't you ? I want you to take me back there . Back ? - To where I scratched you . - Claire- - No , okay , she knows I remember . I remember a lot of it now . I remember the room , the medicine , a teenage girl . Okay , so don 't lie to me and make out you don 't know what I 'm talking about . My baby is sick , and you 're gonna take me back there to get what he needs right now . It 's not far from here . Jack ... may I have a word with you ? Sure . Who is he ? What ? The man that you are keeping in the hatch . Did Locke tell you- - Locke did not tell me anything . Who is he ? We don 't know . I wish to speak to him . Speak to him about what ? I wish to speak to him alone . Can you arrange this ? Why should I do that ? Because you wish to keep this a secret . Why are we stopping here ? This is where you scratched me . But there 's nothing here . Where do we go next ? Why are you asking me that ? You need to tell me where to go ! Where is this room ? ! Look , how can you be saying that ? Okay , you grabbed me . That 's why I scratched you- - because you were taking me back to them ! Is that what you think ? You said you remembered . That 's why I brought you here . - You lied ! - Hey ! Get your hands off of her . Go ahead . Please . Do it . Claire ! Claire ! Wake up . How 's it coming ? One down . One to go . Now all 's we need is a little foot to put it on , huh ? Tell you what- - what do you say we sneak out of here and take a walk ? Okay . Whoa . I 'm sorry this is the first time I 've managed to get you out . My friends are afraid you 'll run away . Whoa-ho ! Whoa ! - Don 't tell on me , okay ? - Oh , okay . Whoa . Easy now . Easy . Easy ! Whoa . Okay . Okay , here . This 'll help . Thanks . - Mmm . - What ? - That is really sour . - Is it ? - Mmm . - I hadn 't noticed . Blah . Oh ! Hey--he 's kicking . - May I ? - Yeah ... Claire , can I tell you a secret ? Yes . I 'm gonna miss you . I wi ... I wish you didn 't have to go . Maybe I don 't have to go . We 've been through this , Claire . There 's not enough vaccine for you and the baby . But I 'm not- - I 'm not sick . Thank god . And once you 've delivered , you can go back to your friends , and hopefully you 'll stay that way . What ... what if I want to see the baby ? Hey , nobody 's going to take him from you unless that 's what you want . You have a choice . We 're good people , Claire . We 're a good family . But if you 're gonna trust us with your child , I want you to be sure . Okay ? Sure . There you are . Where are you going ? I know this is it . It 's here . Claire ! Leave her alone . - Excuse me ? - Let her look . Look for what ? Claire ! Claire ! Flashlights . There are lights . I 'm gonna see if I can turn the power on . Are you okay ? This way . What is this place ? It 's where they were gonna keep him . Wake up . Wake up . - Who are you ? - Shh ! They 'll hear you . Look , you have to get out of here . What ? You have to get out of here- - now ! - Wha- - no , no , no . I can 't leave . - Yes , you can . Come on . I can 't leave . No ! Stop . What are you doing ? Don 't scream . They 're gonna do it tonight . What ? Do what ? What are you talking about ? Ow ! You 're going to die . They 're gonna cut him out of you . I can get you back to your camp , but we have to leave now . No , no , no ! Hey , you 're lying . You 're lying , okay ? I 'm sure about this . Where 's Ethan ? I want to talk to Ethan . Ethan wouldn 't hurt me . You 'll thank me for this one day . It 's a vaccine . We don 't want him to get sick . It 's here . The medicine 's here . Help me . Help ! Kate ! Come here ! I need some help ! Help me up with this . What is it ? It 's in here . The vaccine 's in here . - Okay . Come on . - Okay . One , two , three ! Okay . It was in here . The vaccine was in here ! It was in- - where is it , where is it , where is it ? The vaccine was in here ! Where is it ? ! You were bringing me back here . Where is it ? ! You know where it is , don 't you ? Tell me ! Tell me where it is ! Tell me ! Ethan ? Ethan ? Ethan ! Ethan , I 'm sure . Ethan ! Hey ! Hey , Ethan ! Ethan ! I 'm- - I 'm sure I want- - I want you to take the baby . Ethan ! Who are- - who are you ? - Claire ! - Yeah ! I 'm here ! I can hear you ! Where are you ? Be quiet . I 'm here , Ethan ! Be quiet . No , no . It 's okay . I have to give him to them . I have to give him to them so he 'll be safe , okay ? Help ! I 'm here ! Ethan ! - Stop ! - No ! You weren 't ... trying to take me back , were you ? You were trying to save me . I carried you on my back to your camp . I left youwhere they would find you . I 'm sorry . Where are you going ? You 're not the only one who didn 't find what they were looking for . This is as far as I go . Your baby ... was it a girl ? Yes . What was her name ? Alex ... Alexandra . I remember a girl- - a girl with blue eyes ? She , uh , she helped me . She saved me ... just like you did . She wasn 't like the others . She was good . I 'm sorry that you didn 't find what you were looking for . And I hope your baby 's not infected . But if it is ... I hope you know what must be done . Back for more tools ? He knows , John . Well , there you go . Be careful what you say to him . He 's smart and curious . Just give us a shout when you 're done . And if the alarm goes off , don 't tell him what it 's for . What is it for ? Hello . I am Mr. Eko . Henry Gale . Do you mind if I sit , Henry ? Okay . How long have you been in here ? Two days . Are they treating you well ? Treating me well ? I 'm a ... a prisoner . And I don 't know why or for what- - You are a prisoner because they are being careful . They are being careful because they believe you are lying . Why would I lie ? They think I 'm one of these ... " others " ? Other what ? Please stop talking , Henry . The first night I spent on this island , I was dragged into the jungle by two men . They never spoke a word to me , nor I to them . I killed these men- - smashed in their head with a stone , felt their blood on my arms . I need you to know how sorry I am for this . I need you to know that I am back on a righteous path now and that I regret my actions . I ask you for your forgiveness . Why are you telling me this ? Because I needed to tell someone . He looks good . Fever 's broken . The rash has even started to fade . Thank you so much . I didn 't do anything . I 'll , uh , check back in a couple of hours , okay ? Okay . Hey . Hi ! Look . Mommy made this for you when you were still inside her tummy . Yeah . You know what ? I wanted them to take you . But now I know- - now I know that we 're supposed to be together , you and me . We 're supposed to take care of each other , okay ? You 're mine , and I love you . I love you so much . Yeah . - No cheeseburgers , huh ? - No cheeseburgers . Bon appétit . Is that true what you said about Hemingway ? - You have good ears . - You have thin doors . - You read Hemingway ? - Sure . Guy ran with the bulls , fought in the spanish civil war- - stuff I can wrap my brain around . This I can 't get through five pages of . Hmm . Dostoevsky had his virtues , too . He was a genius , for one . Bullfighting isn 't everything . So which one are you ? I 'm sorry ? Are you the genius ? Or are you the guy who always feels like he 's living in the shadow of the genius ? I was ... I was never very muchinto literary analysis . I just don 't understand why you let the doctor call the shots . No one calls the shots . Jack and imake decisions together . Right . Okay . My mistake .

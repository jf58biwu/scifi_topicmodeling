 You 'll make man ? No . Woman . Now , use your electrical probe to stimulate the nerve endings , and you should see the frog 's leg twitch . The probe , Igor . Yes , master . They banned me from advanced algebra . They mocked my work in wood shop . I 'll show those shortsighted barnies who 's mad now . More power . Yes , master . It 's alive ! Alive ! Turn it off ! Ahem . Principal 's office . Now . A week of detention ? Nice going , frog boy . You know what really bites ? We created a woman out of thin air , but I 'm flunking life science . Too bad you can 't turn Lisa in for your lab final . If you did , I 'd guarantee you 'd get an A. Nobody understands my genius . There 's gotta be somebody out there who can appreciate what we did by creating you . Another mad genius , huh ? One leaps to mind . Do you remember asking for a wish ? I don 't remember asking for a wish . A laboratory ? Big , crackling electrical things ? Mad genius ? I think I know where we are . Michael Jackson 's ranch ? Think about it . You wanted to meet someone who could appreciate our creating Lisa . So ? So , there 's only one other person who ever did what we did . Frankenstein ! [ GROWLING ] It 's Frankenstein ! It 's Franken- - No . The doctor is Frankenstein . That 's Frankenstein 's monster . [ GROWLING ] [ WHIMPERING ] Hey , guys . Hanging with the mad genius ? Newsflash , Frankenstein wasn 't a real person . And I don 't remember his monster sucking up dust bunnies . You said you wanted to meet someone who 'd appreciate what you 'd achieved by creating me , so I put you in a world where that person exists . Frankenstein . That 's not Frankenstein . That 's Frankenstein 's monster . The doctor is Frankenstein ? Yes . I am Frankenstein . And you are ? Dr. Frankenstein , we are students from the University of Vienna who have come to study your visionary experiments . I see . Creature , another [ INAUDIBLE ] for dinner . And fire up the sauna . I 'm ready for my steam . So , those narrow minded Philistines in Vienna have finally taken notice of my work , eh ? A triumph such as yours could not be kept secret , Herr doctor . Ah , yes . Giving life to the creature . That was my greatest achievement . I had unlocked the secret of creation itself . Odd headache that turned out to be . My god ! First you have the potty training , then you get the terrible twos , with the homicidal rampages . Oh , fire bad . Oh , drink good . Mm . Actually , doc , that 's kind of why we came to see you . We figured since you kind of blew it with leather face , that you might appreciate the creation that my fellow scientist , Dr. Donnelly , and I whipped up . You me to tell me that this lovely young lady is a being of your own construction ? You betcha . Incredible . There are no sutures , no electrons . She is flawless . Hey ! Tell me everything , Herr doctors . This tiny machine channels the energies used to power your electrical woman ? It 's called a computer . We made Lisa with it . This is quite diverting , my young friends , but your creation is little more than a toy . She has no real scientific value . Oh ? As opposed to Jeeves over there ? I know you 're not as stupid as he thinks you are . I know I can get through to you . These look awfully painful . Do they hurt ? [ GROANING ] Oh my gosh , I 'm so sorry . Ha ha ha . Perhaps you would care to put your creation to the test ? A challenge , if you will , to see which is the superior creature ? All in the name of science , of course . Let 's rock . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] We have a winner . In your face , doc . Into your cell , you pathetic failure ! You have humiliated me for the last time ! Why 'd you treat him like that ? Because he is obsolete ! Obsolete ? You 're talking about a living being here . Seven living beings , actually . Morons , one and all . But now I must salute the victors . I 'm truly humbled by your achievement . Join me , and we shall discuss matters of science and philosophy . Hope there 's food . Let me show you a little something I have been tinkering with . Impressive , no ? That depends . What does it do ? Allow me to demonstrate . Stand back . There you are . A souvenir of your stay at Castle Frankenstein . Uh , thanks . I guess we should be hitting the road . No ! I mean , what is the rush ? You have not yet met Ilsa . Guten tag . Ilsa , why don 't you entertain them with your many exotic talents ? Yeah , Herr doctor . It would be my pleasure to show them a most wonderful time . We don 't need to leave right away , do we ? Catch ya later , doc . Incredible . Ah ! I see , the File menu executes the command functions , like so . This isn 't exactly what I had in mind . Yeah , but it 's still kind of a turn on . Guys , we 've gotta do something to help the poor creature . Maybe we should get him some flavored chalk . Fine . If you 're not gonna do anything , then I 'll just have to take care of Doctor Frankenstein myself . Lisa , are you OK ? I don 't know . I tried to zap , and I got all light headed . My magic 's just gone . What do you mean , gone ? She means gone . Impudent whelps . You dared to think that your intellect was superior to mine ? Huh ? Creature , seize them . Seize them . [ ROARING ] Boy , that creature really doesn 't like us . Lisa , how you doing ? I feel so weak . He cut off access to most of my files . I don 't know how much longer I can exist without them . Whoa . Virtual reality . Dr. Frankenstein , you have to give me my computer back before it 's too late . You don 't know what you 're doing . On the contrary , I know exactly what I am doing . Creature ? You make man ? No . Woman . Keep trying , doc . I hope your next invention 's a Stairmaster . What ? She 's beautiful . Not some skinny mini like yours . Creature , place Lisa on the slab . What ? By combining Lisa 's energy force with my own power source , I will bring my perfect Fraulein to life . Unfortunately your creature will be destroyed in the process , but hey , that 's progress for you . You don 't need to destroy Lisa . Just let us go and we 'll help you . Oh , it is too late to seek favor with me now . You thought it amusing to mock me . We shall see who has the last laugh now , funny boys . Creature , I said put her on the slab ! You don 't have to do this . You can stand up to him . He master . Behold as I prove yet again that I , Victor Frankenstein , am the greatest genius ever to walk among men ! Know that . Hm ? Lis , hang on ! What 's happening ? He 's draining Lisa 's life force to jump start his creature . My goodness , [ INAUDIBLE ] , you are so skinny . I will go now and make me the strudel and the schnitzel , and maybe later I 'll let you take a peek at my ankle , yeah ? Oh my god , she is perfect . Lis ? You OK ? Lis ? Is she- - Yes . I 'm afraid it took all her energy to give life to my new creation . A pity to destroy one so lovely . You look so tense . It is because your trousers are too tight . I will let out the inseam , yeah ? Oh , yeah . But Sarah , there 's a time and place for everything , my pet . You got your toy , Frankenstein . Give us Lisa , and let us go home . I think not . My new creation should cause quite a sensational in Vienna , and I can 't risk having you two around to disrupt my gloating . I shall be taking this as well , as it has proven a most useful tool . Farewell . Take me too ? You ? Why should I spoil the moment of my greatest triumph by bringing along my most dismal failure ? Go crush something . It 's all over . We 've lost her . Don 't give up . I got a plan . Hey , Mr. Stitchy ? Is that your head , or did somebody ralph down your neck ? This is your plan ? This is my plan . There 's a rumor going around the laboratory that the doctor left certain parts off . You know , a bolt here , some nuts there . [ ROARING ] You see ? My plan . I tricked the creature into knocking the door open for us . That 's great . So how do we prevent the creature from knocking our heads off from us ? Oh . Well , my plan worked . You take it from here , Wyatt . Stop ! Do you want to help Lisa ? We 're the only two guys who could save her . Lisa nice . Teach me peek a boo . Peek a boo good . Choke bad . Fix her . Think you can do it without a computer ? Do we have a choice ? I think that 's everything . Ready ? I 'm worried . We 're not exactly in our element here . We belong here . We captured the elusive spark of life from the vast nothingness . We created a beautiful woman from that inky void , and we can do it again . And maybe this time she 'll shower with us ! We 've got full power ! We gotta do it now ! This will either fully restore Lisa 's programming or turn her into toast . Toast bad . Lis , I don 't know if you can hear me , and I know we don 't have the slightest idea what the hell we 're doing , but we 're still going to try . And if- - it doesn 't work out , I just want you to know that the best wish you ever granted us was being our friend . You OK ? Yeah , yeah . Something in my eye . Mine too . Take her up . Hit it ! More power ! I think it 's working . Everything for myself . Creature , have you seen my buggy- - ah-ha ! Trying to steal my glory , are you ? I swear in the name of science , you will rue the day that you ever met Dr. Victor Frankenstei- - Power 's dropping ! We 're losing her ! Do something ! She 's alive ! Alive ! I love saying that . Lis ? Lisa , can you hear me ? I smell toast . Welcome back , Lis . How do you feel ? Kind of tingly . But good . You guys really came through . It wasn 't just us . The creature helped a little . The creature- - Oh , no ! He saved you . Poor creature . He was feared and hated because no one understood him . Although his appearance was hideous , his soul was pure . He gave his life to save mine . Oh , creature , I 'll never forget you . Uh , Lise ? Can 't you just , you know , zap him back to life ? Oh , yeah . Lisa ? Hey , big guy . Thanks for saving me . Kiss ? OK , but no tongue . No , you imbecile ! Bishop moves diagonally . Diagonally . Dr. Frankenstein , we have come for your creation ! Nein ! He may be an abomination in the eyes of God , but I will not let you destroy him . [ INAUDIBLE ] ! Come on , no more sleeping ! Your move , your move . Your move . THEME SONG : Weird Science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip . Something different will make it Weird Science . Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces . Bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

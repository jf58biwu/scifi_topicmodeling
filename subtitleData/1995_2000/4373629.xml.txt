 Saratoga control , this is ISSCV-4656 inbound . Requesting landing coordinates . Track number 4656 is bearing 180 . Twenty-five seconds from landing ... on final approach . It 's late . Capra , this is { y : i } Saratoga . I am holding a green deck for recovery on Loading Bay 4 . Pony onboard . Loading Bay 4 . Loading Bay 4 . Mail call ! We thought we were alone . We believed the universe was ours . Until one night in 2063 , on an Earth colony 16 light-years away ... they struck . And now we are at war . My name is Lieutenant Colonel T.C. McQueen . I 'm an InVitro , a race of artificially gestated humans . I command a Marine Corps squadron ... the 58th . They call us the Wild Cards . We fight when called ... in space , on land and at sea . To lose this war means more than defeat . To surrender is to never go home . All of us must rise to the call above and beyond . West , Nathan . Let 's go ! My parents . Ten , 11 , 12 . - Wang , Paul . - Right here . What 's the big hooh-hah ? It 's only mail . You 'll find out soon enough . Mail call 's the only thing we have to look forward to . Come on . Here you go . What are you waitin ' here for , Hawkes ... letter from Ma and Pa sayin ' how proud they are ? Mail call 's no place for Tanks . In 15 years , all I ever got were divorce papers ... and a letter of congratulations for being a finalist ... in the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes . Hawkes , Cooper . Come on . Let 's go . Hawkes , Cooper . Here ! McQueen , T.C. Sir ! Sod from Wrigley Field ! Grenadin of beef in a béarnaise sauce . I 'd say left center , near the vines . My fiancée owns a restaurant . He always wafts the pages over a plate before mailing them . Ed 's mom will come and stay with us when she 's born . That 's right . It 's a she . I have to carry on that Vansen double " X " chromosome . I 've decided I ... - We 've decided to name her ... - Anything but Marian . - Marian . - Oh ! - It was inspired by you . - Inspired ? You ripped me off . We 're naming her after Mom . You 're doing what you need to for her memory ... and , uh , I 'll do what I can . You little ... You know that 's what I wanted to name my baby since I was 12 . I never even owned a TV . Let alone be the star of a show ? Look at this . If you are here to gripe , take it on out . The high high-ups want it . Ever since an InVitro assassinated Secretary General Chartwell ... there has been considerable unrest back home . A documentary featuring InVitros in the war ... broadcast over the Armed Forces Network to a billion viewers ... will do its part to help settle things down . I do my part by everyday actions . I don 't need a camera to give them validity . I know you are a private man , Ty . But you know as well as I do ... that wars are not just won or lost on the battlefield . Morale at home is as important as a hundred Saratogas . A project such as this one is the most powerful way ... to let the folks back home see those ... everyday actions . Just think of it as going into battle , and you 'll be fine . I 'd rather face an entire Chig division than one digital camera . West ! What 's your problem ? Sorry , sir . My-My parents weren 't notified about my brother 's death . - Is there anything you can do ? - You 're asking me to write them ? No . Um ... I mean ... I don 't know . I 'm sorry . Nathan . The Corps usually notifies next of kin with a personal visit home . I 'm sure they 've been notified . I can 't be sure . I mean , it 's not in the letter . They have no idea they 've lost a son . Parents of marines have lost their sons for 300 years , Nathan . The Corps has experience letting them know . But if there 's anything I can do to help you , I wanna know . You all right ? Mission briefing in 10 mikes . In preparation for the massive offensive , Operation Roundhammer ... the directive of this mission is to disrupt the Chigs ' supply line . The planet Memnon is rich in merconzium 5 ... an ore the Chigs mine for use in their weapons system . What they mine , they store ... along with other supplies and matériel ... in deep underground bunkers . Because of the depth , it 's considered questionable ... that a bombing mission would have maximum results . However , there exists a fortuitous window of opportunity ... to deploy a small ground force . Now , I 've been gettin ' an earful of bitchin ' and moanin ' ... about pilots being deployed as ground pounders . Hear this , C.F.B. This is not the air force . This is the Corps ... air-ground combat element ... of the 51st MEU ... every marine a rifleman . Therefore , you will fight on command ... where needed , how needed . - Do I make myself clear ? - Yes , sir ! You 'll buddy up and strategically place explosives ... into the ventilation shafts leading into these underground bunkers . They will be detonated once you 're airlifted out . This is a quickie , people ... surgical and precise . Wheels up at 0750 . So , G.I. Geequed gonna be on TV . Lieutenant Hollywood , you pair up with Hill . Take the northern point . Wang , ' Phousse , you take the central point . West and I will take the southern point . Lieutenant Vansen , I 'd feel more comfortable with a partner other than Hawkes . - What 's your bitch , Hill ? - Yeah , Hill . If you 're with Hawkes ... you can pop off Chigs no problem when they come up for his autograph . You 're with Hawkes . Deal with it . We 're gonna be positioned half a klick apart . Keep in radio contact . I can 't believe , out of a quarter of a million marines ... I get buddied up with a nipple-neck . If we weren 't in Chig territory ... I 'd be stuffing you down this hole . Now shut your mouth and look alive . God ! Wow . Damn . I just ... stepped in I don 't know what . Hooh ! That stinks . Don 't wipe it off . Regulations say any contact with an unknown foreign substance ... must be checked by the biotechies aboard ship . Right . I hope I don 't have to sit in quarantine again . Incoming ! 'Phousse . Vanessa . Vanessa ? Oh , no . I ... I can 't see . - I can 't see . - How many ? - How many ? How many what ? - Okay . Hold on . Hold on . I 'll get you out of here as soon as possible . Queen of Diamonds , this is Joker . Queen of Diamonds , this is Joker . All right . Radio 's down . All right , easy . Easy , Vanessa . I 'm right here . I 'm right here . One second . Okay . Hold tight . Okay . Okay . They sound close . Okay . I wasn 't finished . - I wanted to make it last . - All right . Wang , read it for me . - When we get back . - We might not get back ! I need to hear him now . - Wang , please . - Okay , okay . Page eight . Page eight . Uh , " I finally hired a dessert chef . " You 'll never guess who ... Marilyn , your old college roommate . - Marilyn ? - " We had a booth at the Taste of Rochester , and ... and her banana pudding cream pie was a big hit . " Uh ... - And he says business is up . - No , Paul . I need to hear his words . Damphousse , this is not the time or the place to be getting in ... Read it to me ! " Aft-After Marilyn started working for me , we became good friends . " We have so much in common , just like you and me . " I never have to explain myself as I do now . " There 's no easy way to express what I have to say , Vanessa . " So many things have changed . It 's been a year ... " and no end to the war appears to be in sight . I can no longer wait . " I 'm ... I 'm so sorry , Vanessa . Vansen and West are half a klick from here ... and we need to get you some medical attention . If you go along and it gets hairy , I 'm scared . - You can 't see , ' Phousse . You 'll be ... - Go ! Go ! - Get off ! No ! - It 's just me ! It 's Paul ! Your letter 's scattered everywhere . Come on . Let 's get outta here . We gotta get to the extraction site . They 're comin ' to pick us up . ISSCV-3873 landing . Starboard Pad 5 . Roger . - Corpsman ! - Keep moving , people . Hittin ' the ledge . Okay , one more step . - Please , people . - Okay . On the ground , ' Phousse . - Lieutenant Wang ? - Yeah . - Your boots , sir . - I 'm gonna take her to sick bay first , but then I 'll ... Hey . - ' Phousse , I 'll be right there . - Lieutenant Hawkes . Move in close . You 've just come back from a combat mission . Act tired . Act exhausted . - I am tired . I am exhausted . - Then act that way . So , when am I getting these back ? When we 're done . All right , cut ! Lieutenant Hawkes . Where do you normally go after this ? We usually hit the showers . Moving on . Shower room . - What ? - Don 't worry . We 'll black out the naughty bits , hon . Hear this loud and clear , hon . Any camera makes its way into the shower ... the only thing that 's gonna be blacked out is your head . After that , we usually kick back in the rec room . Moving on . Rec room . Mm-hmm . How is she ? Fragments of her night goggles were in her corneas . Doc says he thinks he got ' em all , but ... he 'll know more tomorrow . She 'll be all right . It 's 2064 . Doctors can cure just about anything ... but they still can 't put together a broken heart . We 've decided to name her ... Marian . ... Marian . ... Marian . ... Marian . ... Marian . Uh , this , uh , is the rec room ... where we Wild Cards relax . Hey , Preston . So you definitely feel just like any other member of the squad ? - Uh , heck , yeah . - No prejudice ? Racism ? Nope . Uh , just , uh , one big happy family here . Interesting you should say that . Because you have no other family . How do you feel when your fellow squad members receive mail and you don 't ? Do you feel any less loyal to the Earth 's forces ... knowing that you have nobody at home to fight for ? No . No , no . Not really . All right . Introduce us to one of your family . Okay . First Lieutenant Paul Wang . Hey . Um , we went through the accelerated flight program together . Tell us what you 're doing now , Lieutenant . I-I 'm filling out a requisition form ... in triplicate , for a new pair of boots . They took mine , and they gave me a pair two sizes too small . Uh ... Oh , this is by buddy Nathan . Right over ... Right here . This is , uh , First Lieutenant Nathan West . We have flown many a dangerous sortie together ... fightin ' Chigs side-by-side , me and this guy . They sent a notification letter ... The wrong Neil West . It 's N-E-I-L , not ... N-E-A-L . How about reading news from home ? Uh , news . Uh , home . That-That ... Who cares about some dumb Tank ? Close in . What did he say ? Uh , before the war , he worked in a bank . News . Hey . Philadelphia ... that means the City of Brotherly Love . Colonel ! Cut . Colonel . Come on over . We should get the two of you together . InVitros to the core , then and now . I 'm only doing this because I 'm under orders . Fine , fine , fine . We 'll just have some fun with it then , huh ? We 'll start with the usual info ... your name , age , where you 're from . Gene Pool 18-C , Batch Kappa-9757 . Anchorage Facility , wasn 't it ? Right . Well , we 'll get all that in a voice-over . Colonel McQueen , why don 't we start with you telling us ... any positive experiences you 've had in the military . Well , I 'm a lifer . That should tell you it 's positive enough . Lifer ? Yeah . No , that 's good stuff . Um , Lieutenant Hawkes says he feels like the 58th is his family . Is that how you felt when you first joined the Corps ? Why don 't you begin with your experiences in the A.I. War ? In , uh ... '47 , during the A.I. Rebellion ... natural-born losses were greater than anticipated ... so InVitros were sent in to fight the silicates . I was shipped to Port Riskin ... the largest ammunition depot in the United States . All of the munitions handlers were InVitros . We were worked around the clock ... 24 hours a day in three shifts ... stacking live explosives in bunkers . Natural-borns never went in those bunkers . One night , faulty wiring caused sparks inside . I tried to go back in , but the sergeant locked the door . Said it was too dangerous . - Let us out ! - Please ! Please ! - Open the door ! Open the door ! - Let us out ! Twenty-seven InVitros ... died at Port Riskin . The official statement on the incident was , uh ... faulty wiring and a jammed bunker door . The natural-born sergeant was never disciplined for his actions . I was brought up on charges for striking my squad leader . It started out as a court-martial trial ... which for InVitros back then , if convicted , meant death by lethal injection . But the Old Man must have had a spark of conscience . 'Cause I only ended up with 120 days in solitary . They say InVitros ... Tanks ... are disloyal ... lazy ... and , uh , unable to dream . The soldiers who were lost in that bunker ... gave their lives loyally for this country . As for dreaming ... I hear the cries of those soldiers ... I see their faces ... screaming for help ... begging for their lives ... every night in my sleep . But , uh ... I wouldn 't call it dreams . Cut . Did you get all that ? Cooper , why don 't we move on to the V.R. game ? I understand you 're quite a whiz at this thing , Lieutenant . Who cares if a few Tanks got torched ? Hawkes ! I feel so stupid ! You got in some pretty good licks there . Nobody ever paid any attention to me like that . I thought this TV stuff was gonna change all that . I thought I 'd be somebody . Cooper , you ... You are somebody ... for what you do every day . We 're all set , Cooper . Okay , Vanessa . Your eyes will be sensitive to the light ... so open them slowly . Good . That 's good . It 'll take a while for them to adjust , okay ? - Okay . - All right . Well , looks to me like we got all the glass . - But it 's all blurry . - And , yes , it will be for a while . Okay ? Now , put these drops in once every six hours ... and stay away from bright lights for a few days . And put on these B.C.G. ' s . - B.C.G. ' s ? - Mm-hmm . Birth control glasses . They 're so ugly , no one will hit on you when you wear them . - Great . - That 's all they sell at the P.X. I gotcha . She got a little upset , you know , but-but ... but it was a minor bump , you know ? So , uh , the next thing that happened ... was she asked me if I wanted her phone number . And I said , uh ... Well , I said , " Guys don 't ... Guys don 't do that anymore . " You know , I know that was wrong ... and it also wasn 't a very good excuse to use ... especially with a real sensitive girl who 'd been hospitalized as many times ... I 'm number 154 ? I can 't wait that long . My call 's a personal emergency . Personal ? Really ? - Anyone else got a personal emergency ? - Yeah . My sister 's baby is due any day . The disk she sent me is three months late . She could 've had the kid by now . My advice ... send a teddy bear and a fruit basket , then get at the end of the line . By the time you get to use the phone , the kid 'll have pimples and be wearing dumb clothes . How much for your spot , Ensign ... Boasberg ? - Ain 't cheap . - Name it . - Anything ? - Anything . Strawberries . A bowl of strawberries in heavy cream . - Rich , thick , heavy cream . - You want fruit ? I don 't know what kind of groceries the Wild Cards chow down on ... but they serve us navy personnel freeze-dried , preserved , dehydrated ... powdered mystery meat with the shelf life of a light-year . So , yeah , I want fruit . Strawberries ? He might as well be asking for diamonds . Look at this ! Even clowns have better-fitting shoes . Talk to Mank . He can get you anything . Mank ? That guy is a greasy weasel . Yeah , but he came through with Chicago deep-dish pizza when I was craving ' . Really ? No . This is a legitimate family emergency . My parents were marines . I grew up on bases . The only way to do this is to go through the proper military channels . As you 've discovered , the death notice was sent ... to the family of the wrong Neil West . The other family has been notified of this regrettable error . Now , the Corps will send this letter to your family . " ... regret to inform you ... " " Sorry for your loss . " " Keep up hope . " Sir , this is a form letter . It 's what should have been sent in the first place . Sir , my brother 's not just some ... number in a book ... or a statistic for the nightly news . He fought , defended and died for the cause he believed in . I am sorry for your loss , Lieutenant . I truly am . Your brother was a good marine . But this is proper Corps procedure . Proper Corps procedure isn 't good enough for my brother , sir . Military channels suck . Regs state that a pictaphone can only be used in an emergency of a military nature . In other words , tough luck . - Vansen . - Sir . I got something for you here from Corps command . Yes ! I knew military channels would get me to the head of the line . What the hell is this ? This says I 'm promoted to captain . - Are you kidding me ? - Way to go , Vansen . Congratulations , Vansen . I don 't wanna be promoted to captain . I wanna use the phone . Congratulations , Vansen . You 'll make a fine captain . - Thanks , Mank . - Too bad though . Not even being a captain can get you to use the phone in this century . Mank . You disgusting piece of black market spooge . What do I gotta do ? I made it happen . Now I don 't know . I 'm next in line . Nicole . " Nicole " is pretty . - Amy . Amy is a nice name . - Your call is being forwarded ... Hey . How about " Rachel " ? Hello . Shane ! I-I can 't believe it . - Ann 's in labor . It 's happening . - Ed . - Hang on . - Ed , what the hell 's goin ' on ? - Ann , look , it 's Shane . - Oh ! Oh , Shane . - I can 't believe it . What timing . - Yeah , what . Ann , I need you to push as hard as you can . Cleansing breaths . Okay , rest . Shane , I was so worried when you didn 't respond . Are you okay ? Uh , yeah . Well , today I was promoted ... Now a big push . Push down toward me . Okay . One more big push . Dear Ann , by the time you receive this ... the baby will probably be walking . I hesitate to call her Marian because I 'm surprised you 're using that name ... since you 've always known I was gonna use Marian when I had a child . You 're married , with a new baby ... and I 'm wading in mud fighting seven-foot bugs on other planets . Did I make the right decision ? I mean , shouldn 't I be starting a family of my own ? Last month , the 58th went on a recon mission that was supposed to be routine . As I was parachuting down ... I could see the rest of the squad backed up against a mountain . I had to make a decision in three seconds ... the time it takes to drop a final 100 feet . I leveled my gun and fired down at the advancing enemy . I lost count of how many I killed . For my actions , I was awarded the Bronze Star . During the ceremony , all I could think of was Mom . When I was eight , my soccer team lost the championship ... because I let my man get by me . And all the ice cream in San Diego couldn 't make me stop crying . Then Mom came into my room and gave me a medal . She said it was for trying extra hard and playing my best . She just tied a red ribbon around a piece of chocolate wrapped in gold tinfoil ... but it was better than the Bronze Star I was receiving . To me , that 's what family is . And I don 't wanna miss that . As I watched your baby being born ... I realized that my decision to join the Corps was the right one ... and that yours to name the baby Marian was also . This is where I belong . However , things are ... different . Before , I was fighting to avenge the death of Marian Vansen . But now I 'm fighting to defend the life ... of Marian Vansen Bowman . Give her a kiss for me . Love , Captain Shane Vansen . I thought he wanted them . I think he ate one . No . I just counted ' em . All there . Boasberg , you gonna eat ' em or just stare ' em into your gut ? I finally got the nerve to propose to my girlfriend ... and I coughed up my place in line for a bunch of strawberries . Strawberries or marriage ? Marriage or strawberries ? I chose strawberries . Now I feel guilty ' cause I took the strawberries over her . If I was you ... I 'd be relieved I went with the strawberries . Commander on deck ! At ease . I am not here as your commodore , but as a comrade-in-arms ... bereft of family , friends and most of the comforts of home . I am missing one bowl of fresh strawberries ... in thick , heavy cream . Gentlemen , if you know the whereabouts of the stolen fruit ... you may place it outside my cabin door within an hour . No questions asked . If , after one hour ... the strawberries are not returned ... I will resume being your commodore . A shipboard search will be conducted . The guilty parties will be found ... bound , quartered and cast overboard . Carry on . Good move , swabbie . With one swallow , you just saved your butt twice . Lieutenant Wang . - Your boots . - Thank God . - They look great . What was on ' em anyhow ? - Chig dung . Sir , you stepped in an enemy latrine . Oh , man ! And they still stink . You know , they are softer . Attention to orders . " To all who shall see these presents , greeting . " Know ye , that reposing special trust and confidence ... " in the fidelity and abilities of Shane Vansen ... " I do appoint her a captain in the United States Marine Corps ... to rank as such from the 16th of April , 2064 . " Ready , hut ! Congratulations , Vansen . You deserve it . Promise you 'll do the same for me someday ? Ready , hut ! First Lieutenant Cooper Hawkes is an InVitro ... that 's just another one of the guys . Hawkes 's commanding officer is fellow InVitro ... Colonel T.C. McQueen , Gene Pool " 13-C " , Batch Kappa-9757 , Anchorage Facility . Yes , sir ! Colonel McQueen and Lieutenant Hawkes ... have come to have a father-son relationship ... a closeness that is extended to the rest of the 58th . It 's a bond that the Marine Corps has encouraged ... as they send these brave men and women into battle . Because while prejudice may exist elsewhere ... it never has in the Marine Corps ... where InVitros have always been treated equally and fairly . The fact that their commanding officer ... Time to pay up , Captain . ... soldier 's larger goal to loyally defend the Earth ... and all its people ... no matter their race , creed , color or origin of birth . Soft , fluffy paper . Dear Mom and Dad , I 'll never forget the first time I saw my brother . Mom said she had a dream she was gonna have a daughter ... that I was gonna have a new baby sister . But that day , you told me the stork fooled us . You even formally introduced us . Nathan , this is your brother , Neil . Twenty years later , I can remember thinking ... " His hands are so small . " I can return to that moment in the time it takes to close my eyes . And in that instant , no time has passed . Not a minute of my life or Neil 's has gone by . On April 9 , at 1800 , on the Planet Mors ... your son ... my brother ... was killed in action . Neil was courageously defending his position and died valiantly . But now , I can never throw him another football ... or share an inside joke . Today , I 'd easily give my own life just to be able to argue with him . And yet ... it doesn 't mean I 'm unable to let him know how much he meant to me ... how much I love him . Because to tell you , Mom and Dad , is to tell Neil . I can 't express how much I miss him ... how much I miss you both and John . Keep him safe . And if one day you should receive a yellow envelope from the marines ... don 't bother to open it . Reread this letter and know how much your sons loved one another and you ... and that we are once again together . With all my love , your son ... Lieutenant Nathan West . Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

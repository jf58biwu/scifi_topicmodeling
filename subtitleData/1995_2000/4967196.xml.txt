 Rust ? That 's right , Captain . High levels of ferric oxide- - corroded iron particles . Would you mind telling me how iron could rust in space without oxygen ? I wish I could . Mr. Paris , alter our course to follow that trail of rust . One-quarter impulse . Aye , Captain . Captain , look at this . I 'm picking up traces of complex hydrocarbons in the rust- - benzene , ethylene , acetylene ... That sounds like gasoline . Gasoline ? It 's a liquid fuel that was used centuries ago on Earth . They burned it to drive internal combustion engines . How did it get out here ? I 'm detecting a small object . It appears to be the source of the rust and hydrocarbons . Put it on screen . Magnify . Apparently , it is a ground vehicle from mid-20th-century Earth . Whew ! It 's a 1936 Ford , actually . Mr. Paris ? That was the manufacturing date : 1936 . Ford was the name of the company that built it . Antique vehicles are a hobby of mine . Internal combustion engine , a reciprocating piston cylinder design . Fuel source was a refined petroleum . Gasoline . So , is this an early hover car ? No , you 're about a century too early for that . This is about one step ahead of the horse-drawn carriage . Traces of potassium nitrate , ammonium and methane back here . I think you 'll find that 's manure . Horse manure , if I 'm not mistaken . Judging from the mud on the wheels and the alfalfa seedlings stuck in the metal frame , I 'd say this vehicle belonged to a farmer , or , at least , someone who lived in a rural area . But the question is : How did it get here ? I doubt there are many 20th-century farmers driving around the Delta Quadrant . There are no signs of any wormholes or temporal anomalies in this region of space . Let 's run a metallurgical analysis of the vehicle . There 's still oil in the crankcase , water in the radiator . I wonder if the battery 's still charged . Now , let 's see . This is before voice-command activation , so there should be something in here called a key . Key ... What are you doing ? Trying to bring this beauty back to life . Now , where are the keys ? Aha ! Here they are . Okay , choke out , clutch in , give her a little gas , turn the key , and step on the starter . Sorry . Next time ... you might give us a little warning , Mr. Paris . Aye , Captain . I suggest we increase the ventilation in the cargo bay before we are asphyxiated . What 's that ? That is an amplitude modulation receiving device . AM radio . I 'm not sure we 'll pick up much out here . Whoa . What was that ? What is that ? It 's too regular to be random interference . I 'm running the signal through the ship 's database . It 's an ancient Earth distress call known as an SOS . I 've located the source of the SOS signal . It 's coming from a planet in a star system bearing 310 mark 215 . Mr. Paris , lay in a course . Aye , Captain . Why didn 't we pick up this signal earlier ? This isn 't one of the standard frequencies we monitor . Messages on this channel only travel at the speed of light- - too slow for interstellar communications . Course laid in , Captain . Warp 6 . Engage . I 'll run a diagnostic check , sir . Mm-hmm . Bring us out of warp . Full scan , Mr. Kim . The SOS signal is coming from the third planet . It 's Class-L- - oxygen-argon atmosphere . Any life signs ? There 's a great deal of trinimbic interference in the upper atmosphere . I can 't get a clear reading of the surface . Can you pinpoint the coordinates of the distress call ? Yes , here it is . It 's coming from a continent in the northern hemisphere . We won 't be able to transport through this kind of interference . I might be able to take an away team in a shuttlecraft . That would not be wise , Commander , as the atmosphere is charged with trinimbic turbulence . A shuttlecraft could not safely navigate the currents . We could land the ship . Are you sure that 's necessary ? Someone on this planet is sending out a distress call . If that someone is as old as the truck in the cargo bay , they 're long-dead by now . This might be an automated distress call . Possibly . But something brought that truck halfway across the galaxy and that something might be down on that planet . And if it brought the truck here , it might be able to take us home , too . I 'd say it 's worth a look . Mr. Paris , prepare the ship for landing . Captain , I think I should tell you I 've never actually landed a starship before . That 's all right , Lieutenant , neither have I . Bridge to Engineering . We 're going to land the ship , Ms. Torres . Take the warp core off-line , vent all plasma from the nacelles , and stand by to engage atmospheric thrusters . Aye , Captain . This is Lieutenant Tuvok to all decks . We are preparing to land the ship . Go to Blue Alert and report to Code Blue stations . I 've plotted a descent course . How close do you want to land to the distress coordinates ? No closer than two kilometers . Okay . Atmospheric controls at standby . Landing mechanisms on line . lnertial dampers at maximum . All decks report Condition Blue , Captain . Put her down , Mr. Paris . Status . We 're on the glide trajectory . Altitude- - 100 kilometers . Speed- - 10,000 kph . Encountering some trinimbic turbulence . Compensating . We have an EM discharge in the lateral relays . I 'm rerouting the ODN conduit . Another EM discharge . I think we 're all right , though . 20 kilometers to the landing site . We should be able to see it now . Extend landing struts . Prepare to release inertial dampers and adjust them to match the planet 's gravity . Landing struts down and locked . Standing by environmental controls . Here we go . Disengaging engines , securing thruster exhaust . We 're down . Not bad ... for a beginner . Nice day . I 've locked on to the distress signal . It 's 1.5 kilometers on a bearing of 246 . Wait a second . I 've got something else . There 's a high concentration of trianium particles , bearing 225- - a little over a kilometer away . Looks like some kind of power source . Two teams . Chakotay , yours investigates the power source . Tuvok , Kim , you 're with me . My God . The metal is an aluminum alloy . It appears to be an ancient Earth aircraft . The SOS call is coming from inside . I 've found the AM transmitter . From what I can tell , it 's sending out an automated SOS . What about the power source ? Somehow I find it hard to believe the battery on this aircraft has been running for 400 years . I don 't recognize the power signature . Hold on , Captain . I found what appears to be an alien fusion-based generator . It 's hooked up to the AM transmitter . Chakotay to Janeway . Go ahead , Commander . We 've located the source of the trianium readings . It appears to be some sort of mine shaft . I 'd like to bring out another security detachment before we go inside . Good idea . I 'll join you . Janeway out . I want the two of you to analyze the alien generator , then see what you can find out about this SOS call . I 'm picking up something directly ahead . Some kind of power signature . Fusion-based . This looks like some kind of cryostasis chamber . How many bodies are there ? Eight . And the equipment is still functioning . He 's human . And from the clothes , I 'd say he 's from the same era as the vehicle we found . His life sign readings are minimal , but ... he 's alive . Captain , according to these readings , there are five other cryostasis chambers nearby . No life signs in any of them . This appears to be the only one with people inside . There 's another male over here . This one 's a female . She 's wearing some sort of leather jacket . And a pair of gold wings . Wait . There 's a name tag here . I think it 's " A , period ... " E-a ... r-h-a-r-t . " " Earhart . " A ... . Earhart . Amelia Earhart . Who 's Amelia Earhart ? She was one of the first female pilots in Earth history . In the mid-20th century , she became quite famous for flying across the Atlantic Ocean . In 1937 , she attempted to fly around the world . According to the records of the time , on July , 2 , 1937 , Earhart and her navigator , Fred Noonan , took off from New Guinea , and they were headed east around the equator . But somewhere in the South Seas , they vanished , and their disappearance became one of the most celebrated mysteries of the 20th century . Why didn 't they think she 'd just crashed ? That was the most commonly held theory . However , numerous searches of the area failed to produce the wreckage of an aircraft , so people began to speculate . Some thought she 'd been shot down and captured by the Japanese navy . Others thought that she and Noonan had flown off together on some sort of romantic adventure . Of course , the most ridiculed notion was that she had been ... abducted by aliens . Well , it certainly looks like that 's what happened . From what we can tell , all eight of the people in that stasis chamber were taken from Earth in the 1930s and brought here . The question is : Why ? And where are the aliens who did this ? Scans of the region show no alien life signs . Continue the scans . They may not be here now , but once they detect our presence , they might return . In the meantime , we 'll have to get some answers on our own . Have you had any luck tapping into the computer system in the cryo-chamber ? Not as of yet . We are having difficulty decoding the operating system . There 's one way we could find out what happened . We could wake those people up and ask them . I 've had the same thought myself . is that wise ? We don 't know how these people are going to react when they wake up in an alien world in the 24th century . True , but I 'm not willing to just leave them in stasis for another 400 years . And if we can find out how they were brought here , we might be able to use that method to get home . We 'll just have to be very careful how we handle this . I suggest that only human crew members be present when we revive them . Agreed . Mr. Kim , I want a complete analysis of those cryostasis tubes . Find a way to deactivate them safely . Aye , Captain . Commander , apprise the Doctor of our situation . Tell him to instruct Kes in the proper procedure for reviving someone from cryostasis . She could be made to look human easily enough . In the meantime , I suggest we all brush up on ancient Earth . We 're about to meet a bit of our history . We 're ready , Captain . All the cryo-tubes are linked by a common power source so we 've decided to revive everyone simultaneously . Proceed . The power 's off-line . Deactivate locking mechanisms . Captain , this one 's armed with some kind of weapon . Disarm him , just to be on the safe side . I know this must be very strange for you . No ... who are you ? What is going on here ? I demand you release me immediately . Please , if you 'll just listen for a moment , I 'll try to explain . You are all speaking Japanese . Sounds to me like you 're speaking English . It 's because of a device we have- - a universal translator . It allows us to talk to each other , even though our languages aren 't the same . Who are you people ? Look , just let us go home . We won 't tell anybody . The hell we won 't ! I 'm going to let the world know what you people have done . Do you know who you 've kidnapped here ? Amelia Earhart . I 'm her navigator . This is going to be headline news . You people are in trouble . Fred ... let her talk . What I have to tell you is going to sound hard to believe , even preposterous . We think you were abducted from Earth ... in the 1930s , and brought millions of miles through space to a planet on the other side of the galaxy . You were put into a ... a kind of deep sleep for a very long time . It 's not the 1930s anymore . The year is 237 1- - over 400 years from the time you were abducted . You must think we are awfully gullible . Tell me , what 's the last thing you remember before waking up here ? We were over the Pacific , running low on gas . We were looking for an atoll to set down . We ... tried to send out an SOS and ... suddenly there was this ... huge light in back of us , and the plane ... stopped dead ... and then it started moving backward toward the light . I must 've blacked out , I ... and I w-woke up here , just now . That 's just the way it was with me . I was in my truck , heading into town . I was just about to get onto the blacktop when this big light come down from the sky- - just about blinded me . Next thing I know , the whole truck was lifted up off the ground . I believe what happened was that you were abducted by aliens . And if we can find out how they got you here , we might all be able to get back to Earth . I want some real answers now . I assure you , I am telling the truth . You- - come on down here and get those , uh , funny-looking guns of theirs . You- - get over there with the others . What is this ? It 's a medical device . I 'm just trying to make sure that everyone is all right . Now ... how do we get out of here ? Chakotay to away team . Janeway here . Captain , I 'm picking up some energy displacements on the surface . I think it may be alien humanoids . It looks like they 're using some kind of deflection system to trick our sensors . I think you 'd better get up here . Who 's that talking ? That 's Commander Chakotay , on our ship . Commander , huh ? Okay . Now hear this , Commander . There 's a gun pointed at the lady 's head right now , so you call Washington and you tell them we 're holding your people prisoner and they 're not going anywhere until I personally talk to J. Edgar Hoover . You 've got one hour . Captain ? ! It seems we 're being held hostage , Commander . I suggest you pay attention to what the gentleman says . I understand . Chakotay out . All security personnel report to the cargo bay immediately . The compass isn 't working . I know what we 've told you sounds hard to believe , but there was a time when no one believed that a woman could fly across the Atlantic . Now people are able to travel between the stars . The galaxy is full of many different species . For instance , this young woman isn 't human . She 's an Ocampa . I 've been on expeditions all over the world , and I 've seen people do all kinds of strange things to their bodies . That doesn 't mean that Martians have invaded Earth . Actually , it was the other way around . Mars was colonized by people from Earth in 2103 . That 's enough ! All of you just go over there and sit down and keep quiet ! The trinimbic interference has affected the transporter 's targeting scanners . We can 't beam into the chamber , so we 'll have to go on foot . We will deploy throughout the caves , sealing off any exit from the chamber . Let 's go . Now is probably not the best time for that , Fred . Just a little pick-me-up . He 's had a few nips from that flask , Captain . We could probably rush him , get the gun . Let me try to talk to Earhart first . She seems reasonable . Maybe I can get through to her . Miss Earhart ? I want you to know you 've always been an inspiration to me . Because of you , generations of women have become pilots . Generations ? What 's your name ? Kathryn Janeway . I heard the Commander call you Captain . What exactly do you captain ? The Federation Starship Voyager . Starship ? That supposed to mean it flies through space ? That 's right . That isn 't possible . Only in books- - H.G. Wells , Jules Verne . Maybe if you saw it , you 'd think otherwise . Saw it ? Where is it ? On the surface . We 're actually about 100 meters underground now . If you 'd come with me to see Voyager , you 'd realize that what we 're telling you is true . And risk a trap . No , you could have hundreds of reinforcements up there . I assure you , we have no interest in harming you . We took you out of stasis to help you . Put yourself in my shoes , Captain . If you were me , would you believe your story ? Maybe not . Let me tell you some of what happened after you disappeared over the Pacific . No trace of you or your plane was ever found , in spite of a massive search . Over the years , there was a lot of speculation about your flight , including the rumor that it was financed by the government , and may have been part of an operation to gather information about the Japanese . Where did you hear that ? It 's somewhat common knowledge . You see , Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 , drawing the United States into a massive world war . In retrospect , your journey was seen in a different light- - perhaps as part of an intelligence mission devised by a government deeply concerned about Japanese war plans . No one was supposed to know about that . Maybe not in 1937 . Now , it 's part of history . Hey , I got an idea . Why don 't we stick them in these things- - put them to sleep like we were ? No fuss , no trouble . Mr. Noonan , that will accomplish nothing . Please , let us take you to our ship . You 'll see that everything we 've told you is true . Show me how to operate this thing . Hey , last time I looked , you were working for me ... and I think we should listen to these people . They just may be telling the truth . What 's the harm in seeing if maybe they do have this starship ? It beats being cooped up in here trying to figure out what happened . How about it ? Anyone want to come along ? Hey , I wouldn 't mind taking a look . Anyone else ? You 're not leaving me behind . Kes and I will stay with the others , Captain . It 'll take about ten minutes to get to the surface . Stay close to us . Mr. Kim . What is it ? I am reading energy displacements again- - possibly alien life signs- - 200 meters ahead . They may be up there . Take cover ! Get down ! This way . What 's all that racket ? Take cover ! I told you it was a trick ! Fred ! Janeway to Chakotay . I 'm here , Captain . We 're pinned down . I can see you from here . Lay down phaser fire . I 'm going to circle around to your left . Try to come at them from the rear . Right ! Chakotay to Voyager . Torres here , Commander . Can you give us some help down here ? I don 't think so . The targeting scanners are still useless . I can 't risk laying down weapons fire if I don 't know where it 's going . Keeping trying to get them on line ! Aye , Commander . Hold your fire . Drop your weapons . Turn around slowly . You 're not Briori . No , I 'm human . Human ? We 're human . You 're working for the Briori . They have ships like yours . I 'll answer any questions you have , but first , we must take care of our wounded . Can we agree to end this ? Yes . I 'm Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager . John Evansville . This is my colleague , Karyn Berlin . Severe trauma to the thoracic cavity , lacerated carotid artery . He 's not going to make it . I wouldn 't be so sure of that . Vascular regenerator . Hmm ... he 's not responding to the treatment . The alcohol level in his blood is so high , it 's inhibiting the repair to his circulatory system . Attempting to compensate . I told you your drinking 'd kill you one day . She 's right , Doc . Just let me die in peace . There 's just one thing I want to say to you first even though it 's 400 years late . Amelia ... I love you . Fred ... you never said anything . You 're married- - or you were . I guess he 's dead now . I just wanted you to know before ... before I met my Maker . There . That should do it . Do what ? You 're healed . You mean , I 'm not going to die ? Aside from a hangover , you 're going to be fine . Oh , Amelia , you , uh you got to forget what I just told you . Promise me . Fred , I already have . Oh ... You 've taken the 37 's . Why ? I 'm afraid I don 't understand . You went into the shrine . You stole the 37 's from the sacred altars and you disturbed the radio signal that we have been so careful to preserve . Captain , I think he 's talking about Earhart and the others . Tell me more about the 37 's . Are you one of them ? I 'm one of their descendants . The 37 's were brought here over 15 generations ago by the Briori . Who are the Briori ? They 're an alien race . They abducted over 300 people from Earth in the year 1937 . Brought them over here , turned them into slaves . But those slaves revolted , killed the Briori , took their weapons and their technology and survived . And now , there are over 100,000 of us . The Briori never came back . Now , you answer me . Why did you steal the remaining 37 's from the shrine ? We didn 't steal them , we simply revived them . Revived them ? They 're dead . No , they were simply in a state of what we call " cryostasis . " That 's a form of sleep that appears very much like death . Do you mean they 're alive ? Yes . My people have come to regard the 37 's as monuments to our ancestors . Nobody has even entered their shrine for generations . Mr. Evansville , we were hoping to find the ship that brought your ancestors here- - possibly use it to get back to Earth a little faster . I 'm sorry . The Briori ship was destroyed in the slave revolt . There 's nothing left . Captain ... I 'm sorry to hear about your long journey home . But you should know that life on this planet is good . We live in three beautiful cities only 50 miles from here . Oh , I 'd like to see your cities . And I 'd like to show them to you . How fast ? Warp 9.9 . In your terms , that 's about four billion miles a second . Think I could take her out for a spin ? Well , uh ... Mr. Evansville has offered to take us on a tour of the settlements . He 's extended the invitation to the entire crew . And the 37 's , of course . You ... ? You 're a 37 ? I guess you could call me that . It would be an honor to show you our cities . Captain 's Log , Stardate 4897 5.1 . Evansville wasn 't exaggerating when he said they have a lot to be proud of here . It was an amazing experience , but it 's left me a little disturbed . Come in . Here 's the damage report you asked for . Thank you . is something wrong , Captain ? You 've seemed a little distracted ever since we came back from the cities . Weren 't you impressed ? A little too impressed . What do you mean ? There 's a thriving sophisticated culture on this planet- - of human beings . In some ways , walking around those cities was ... almost like being back on Earth . It was a little eerie . It reminded me of home , too . Evansville has offered to let any of our crew stay . What will you do about that ? Maybe this is one of those decisions that the Captain has to make for the entire ship . You may have a problem if a lot of people want to stay . I know that . But at the same time , I can 't take a vote every time there 's a major decision to be made . And yet ... we 're a long way from Starfleet and a lot of the rules and regulations i 've learned to uphold seem distant , as well . Am I the only one who is so intent on getting home ? is it just me ? Am I leading the crew on a forlorn mission , with ... no real hope of success ? You 're not alone . I want to get home , too . And there 's not a day that goes by when I don 't hear someone mention Earth . The people here have built a new Earth . We could stay , help them build a human civilization in the Delta Quadrant . Isn 't that an exciting prospect ? Shouldn 't we be grateful for the opportunity they 're giving us ? It is a tempting prospect . But when I hold it up against the prospect of seeing the sunrise over the Arizona desert or swimming in the Gulf of Mexico on a summer 's day , there 's just no comparison . I want to go home . We have 152 men and women on this ship . What happens if half of them decide to stay on the planet ? Could we operate Voyager with 7 5 crew members ? I doubt it . In fact , I don 't think we could operate the ship with fewer than 100 . If too many of the crew choose to stay behind ... we could all be stranded here . Tell all hands to prepare for an announcement from the Captain at 1400 hours . They deserve to make the choice for themselves . Aye , Captain . Here we are . My research on 20th century Earth is a little thin , but I 've done what I can . Pot roast , green beans and something called ... Jell ... O. You know how to make Jell-O ? I even put in fruit cocktail . You don 't say . I don 't know about the rest of you , but I 've made up my mind . There is land here that goes begging , and I could have a big farm , just like I always dreamed . And for you , rice , with a little fish . I even replicated some ginger for seasoning . Very nice . Thank you . Yeah , I have to admit- - life here looks a lot better than what we left on Earth . It 's a paradise by comparison . And there are many Japanese here . I could be very happy . We all could . Right ? I 'm just not sure , I ... What about you , Mr. Neelix ? Have you made your decision ? Oh , yes , indeed . I 'm staying right here with Captain Janeway . She 'd be lost without me . She 's come to depend on me a great deal . What about the rest of the crew ? You think many of them will stay here ? Oh , I don 't think so . At least , not many . Uh , well , that is , there 's a good chance ... Well , now that you ask , I honestly don 't know . You ? You 'd stay here on the planet ? I didn 't say I was going to . I just said I could understand why people would want to . The people here remind me of home . I haven 't felt like that since I left Earth . But ... but you 're Starfleet . You 've always wanted a life in space . I know , but ... my whole life ? On a starship , day after day , with no end in sight ? That 's not exactly what I had in mind . You 're not the first person I 've heard talk like this . A lot of people are thinking about staying . What about you ? Don 't you have some of those feelings ? I 'd be lying if I said I didn 't . Captain . I was told I 'd find you here . Am I intruding ? Not at all . Please join me . I wanted you to know that the group you brought out of stasis- - we 've all decided to stay here on the planet . I understand . I must admit , the thought of traveling through space- - maybe even learning to fly this ship- - was very appealing to me . And I 'd looked forward to getting to know you better . I suspect we have a lot in common . At first , I didn 't know what to do . We talked about it for quite some time . Finally , I realized the people here on this planet are part of us . We 're their ancestors , in a way . Well , it made us feel close to them . The remarkable thing about the humans on this planet is that they evolved very much like the people on Earth . Tens of thousands of light-years apart , both civilizations managed to create a world they could be proud of- - one where war and poverty simply don 't exist . I certainly can 't blame you for wanting to be part of it , any more than I can blame members of my crew if they make the same decision . When will you find out ? In half an hour . Anyone who wants to stay behind is to report to the cargo bay at 1500 hours . I expect Jarvin will stay on the planet . In fact , I 'd bet on it . Why Jarvin ? He 's been more uncomfortable about being on a Starfleet ship than most of the Maquis . And he 's gotten involved with a young woman in Quantum Mechanics . I think they 'd like to settle down , raise a family . The person I expect to see is Baxter . Baxter ? Walter Baxter ? He 's adventurous , a risk-taker . I can see him wanting to take on the challenge of building a new life on this planet . I 'd hate to lose Baxter . He 's a good man . I 'd hate to lose Jarvin . I don 't want to lose anyone . We 've all been through so much together , it just wouldn 't seem right . But I couldn 't blame anyone- - anyone- - for staying behind . I 'm not sure I want to go in . No matter what happens , we 'll make it . Remember that . Captain on the Bridge . All stations , prepare for departure . Condition Blue , Mr. Tuvok . Ms. Torres , antigrav thrusters on line . Thrusters enabled . Mr. Paris , inertial dampers to flight configuration . Impulse drive to standby . Yes , ma 'am . All stations report ready , Captain . Then let 's do it . Take us up .

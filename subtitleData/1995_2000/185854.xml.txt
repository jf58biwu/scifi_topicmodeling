 Don 't tell me : he 's a psychiatrist . Harold Long , consultant in psychological warfare . There 's nothing remarkable about chicken running ! Except when practiced by a 60-year-old general . Gen. Woody Grove , next in line on the general staff . - Chicken running ... - and admiral Jackson . He wanted to cross the atlantic by canoe in a force-8 gale . - any others ? - Six . Well , 7 actually . Mrs. Peel , this is Dr. Harold Long . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? - and now ? - Lamble . Gordon Lamble , chemical warfare . Doing what ? Climbing the side of St. Paul 's when he fell . - Is he dead ? - No . Just bruises , abrasions , slight internal injuries . - Is he conscious ? - No . - Mind if Mrs. Peel stays here ? - Not at all . - Where are you going ? - Rejoining the colours ! - General Grove 's study . - Did you know him ? Everybody knew him . He was that sort . You 'd do anything for him . Good morning . Mr. Steed , from the war offiice . Major Robertson . Very good , Stanhope . - Come to cause trouble ? - To prevent it . I won 't have a good man 's name dragged through the dirt . Had you known Groves long ? Since I was a cadet . I 've served under plenty of generals , but none like him . - You might be biased ... - Of course ! He had the humanity of Caesar ... the tenacity of Wellington ... the brillance of Napoleon . - Good company . - The best . Why did he do chicken runs ? The motorbike . I honestly don 't know . Phrenology ... You can always tell a military head . - Bullet-shaped . - ah ! Chicken runs are for teenagers , not for men with a chest full of medals . He 's a man of action , fragiled him to sit around . - Then administration ... - Exactly . Rubber stamping wasn 't for him . - a soldier , not a clerk . - You admired him . Oh , yes ... I admired him . I 'll get back to London and pour oil on the water . War wound ? Twisted on the assault course . - Good bye , Major . - Good bye , Steed . Close the door . Come out , you 're cornered ! You 're surrounded , can 't you see ? Come out with your hands up . - This is your last chance ! - Can we flush him out ? It 's a cinch , sir . They 've had it . We usually try to aim for the bucket . Great shot ! at cricket , I bowled more to leg . That 's the end of old bucket head . How long has Groves owned a motorbike ? He didn 't , he borrowed it . - Odd thing to do . - Very . - You 're not surprised ? - He did odd things . For instance ? Swimming the Canton reservoir in full battle kit . - at his age ? - He was in shape . - Stanhope ! - Sir ! Sorry to interrupt , but you 're wanted on the range . Very good , sir . - Hope he was helpful . - Very . Nothing like a grenade closeup . No , nothing . Beware of Stanhope . He 's a father fiigure . They hung on his every word . Thanks for the warning . Jupiter . Mercury , I have an assignment for you , from apollo . - Dangerous ? - Dangerous . - Very ? - Very dangerous . How dangerous ? Life and death . - Well , what is it ? - Gordon Lamble . He 's turn chicken . He must be eliminated . You 're not turning chicken too , are you ? Right , 7-second fuse . When I say 3 ... One ... Two ... Three ... Lamble , you said ? When ? as soon as possible . Tonight . Lie back , relax , clear your mind of all but the problem at hand . Concentrate . Together , we 'll fiind a solution . Let me recap . You understood when you saw Lamble on the window ledge . He was puzzled , upset . There was incipient anxiety , but you didn 't nothing for fear that you might push him over . That 's normal behaviour , most intelligent ... Long has mentioned shell shock . Uncontrolled , excited ... This is a very comfortable position . The white feather ! I 'm looking for Watson . You 're out of luck , that 's him up there . How 's it going , Watson ? all normal and responding . Speaking of responses ... are you listening , Freddy ? Call that blond in the pub for me . - Tell her I 'll see her tonight . - Will do . The number 's in my jacket . - Runway cleared for landing . - Roger , landing . Watch your air speed ! - Pull her up ! Be careful ! - Come on , I can handle her ! Your approach is off ! He must be mad ! It 's too late . Too late ! - What have we got ? - Two black roses . - Three corpses . - Four white feathers ... and a partridge in a peartree . In each case , the pattern is identical . Three respected men . - No psychological quirks . - None we know of ... Yet each is dicing with death . Like irresponsible beatniks . Robertson said he turned his ankle on the assault course . So ? There is no assault course . I 'm looking forward to our meeting . How do I play it ? Show him ... your bumps . He 's a part-time phrenologist . Yes ! - Major Robertson ? - Yes . Emma Peel , from Willis Ferguson 's , auctioneers , specialists . Come in , I was waiting . Forgive me , I was expecting a dusty old man leaning heavily on a gnarled stick . - Disappointed ? - On the contrary . What do you think ? I think we could dispose of all this for you . For the family , not me . I 'd leave it all intact . The way he always had it . Interested ? Habit . It 's a hobby of mine , phrenology . You 're full of surprises . How do you rate Napoleon ? - alpha alpha ... - Minus . I dabble in phrenology myself . I am right ? alpha alpha minus ? In my estimation . Old Bernie doesn 't measure up to alexander the Great . - Or Caesar . - Washington or Hannibal . Military things fascinate me . - Why is that ? - The whole concept of life . Sense of challenge , change of scene . - adventure , excitement , danger . - Danger ? I 'm forgetting my manners . May I offer you a drink ? adventure , excitement ... Part of literature now . There are no more wars . They 're becoming push-button affairs . Military life is changing . I 'd have said progressing . The military man is not defunct . But he is ! Defunct . Obsolete . a dodo . It 's easier for the young men who have no idea . But , I have . I 've tasted real army life , just as you described it . You 've no idea what it does to a man . and always the danger , you 've no idea ... Danger as your companion , traveling with it . Restricted information . You should visit the regimental museum while you 're here . - I 'll join you there . - Thank you . - See you later . - Indeed . apollo ? Mercury . I 've found the papers . No , there 's nothing to connect Groves to the organization . I 'm destroying them now . What about danger ? Scaling St. Paul 's , chicken running ? Those men had nothing to prove . Wing commanders , generals . Still , each of them was seeking his own private nirvana . What our zen friends call satori . - Like a drug ? - Yes . That leaves no trace . Some self-destructive society . " Death Wish Inc . " ! and the shake ? How do they flit in ? Neurotic reaction . Like soldiers with battle fatigue . Long here . For you . Speak up . Mr. Steed , it 's Stanhope . I 've got to see you . - Tomorrow ? - No , tonight . I 've found something interesting . I see . You name the place . - The grenade bay ? - Yes . - What time ? - 21 : 30 . I 'll be there . - Progress ? - Possibly . I 'll let you know later . Mr. Steed ! Mr. Steed ! Over here ! In the grenade bay ! Is that you , Mr. Steed ? Over here . " Manton House , open to the public May to October . " Everyday except Wednesdays . " Manton . Manton ? Military museum , birthplace of Colonel Jolian adams . Fell off his horse at the king 's parade . - Never woke up . - Died at Saratoga . - Really ? - Next move ? The curator is another Col. adams , O.B.E. Probably full of memories of the Kyber Pass ... I 'll go see the old boy . and Robertson ? I struck a nerve . It 's curious . When discussing danger , he reacted positively . He reacted to me too . In the nicest way . Charming gesture , chocolates . - Have you opened it ? - No , why ? Don 't . Give them to me . Stand back . - Found anything ? - Sh ! - I thought so . - What ? I 've seen them before . a booby trap ? Whatever you do , don 't touch the wrapped ones . Why not ? Because I like them .

That was before he became president . He was here before joining the 8th army . There 's one of his berets in the allerman room . - So you know Gen. Groves ? - Woody . Of course , charmer . - Bring birds down out of trees . - Tragic ending ... and generous . He spent hours here , helping the young offiicers . Very generous . - Strange about the motorbike . - Not a bit . He was ready to try anything . Telephone . - Bother ! Excuse me . - Of course . - Look after Mr. Steed . - Yes , sir . You 're early . at last ! I thought I 'd come to the wrong place . - From the northern chapter ? - That 's right . - Peters . - John Steed . - Does Col. adams know ? - No , she lives in a dream . She 's recreated the Indian mutiny in her garden . Come see the inner temple . - and up north ? - Pretty hectic . - You weren 't at Liverpool ? - Unfortunately ...

Do take a break . You never stop . I 'll just fiinish this line . Thanks for the chocolates . They were delicious . are you busy later on ? What do you have in mind ? - Were you serious the other day ? - about what ? about the spice going out of living , the lack of daily danger . I thought ... You seemed to agree with me . Safety overkill . Security from cradle to grave . - Safety straps , matches ... - Valves , precautions , regulations . Like driving in second gear ! Exactly ! Life needs danger ! Man used to live by the force of his fiists . - The point of his sword ! - Now , he 's as good as dead ! - Dehydrated . - Sterile . - Frightened . - Tasteless . atrophied . - Nine to fiive . - Crosswords . - Standard of living . - Making payments . - Life 's for living ! - For living !

It never occurred ... - The wangling for that assignment . - Good thing . Sorry ... Mr. Steed , from the war offiice . - She 's working on the library . - a potential member ? an amazon chapter ? - apollo 'd like that . - Could be . Mrs. Peel doesn 't know about The Danger Makers . - Put her in the picture . - Certainly . But she 's your protégée . You initiate her . Good point . Well ... " The Danger Makers " is the name of the society . Our aim is to put some spice in life . Reawaken the jaded palate . We recruit very carefully . The black rose is our emblem . as you can see , a collection of fline flowers . Mind if I sit ? This wet weather gets my leg . How does one get one 's rose ? a series of tests . The " Labors of Hercules " . Psychologically devised , progressively more diffiicult . - and if one fails ? - Don 't even think of it . Quite right . - May I ask a question ? - Certainly . Is there not enough danger for you as a soldier ? You 'd think so , but today there isn 't enough war . Danger is a need . Like food . I was promised Korea , I got Paris . Cyprus ? Defiinitely . Sent to the embassy in Washington . Malaya , the jungle , bandits ... 3 years at the Tower of London . Hence , The Danger Makers . Do you still care to join us ? Yes . There is no turning back later . - I know . - Good . I 'll arrange your intiation . Excuse me . - Clearer ? - Much . a bunch of psychopaths . and they 're dangerous . But who is apollo ? The big chief . apollo is his nom de guerre . - and yours ? - Bacchus . - I might have guessed . - Seemed approriate . We 're ready . You coming , Steed ? I 'll stay and fiinish this excellent brandy. and inspect the premises . - Good luck , Mrs. Peel . - Good evening ... Bacchus . This is the fiirst test . Concentration and nerve . You walk along the seesaws , passing the cables without touching . - Simple . - Childishly so . That depends on the mechanisms . albert will demonstrate . These cables are electric . I switch on the mechanism . If you touch them while the arrow is on white , a bell rings . If the arrow is on black ... The length of the room on the seesaws . When you 're ready . Steady , you 'll kill her ? Do sit down . 5 000 volts . Don 't ruin her concentration . Wonderful . First class ! Bravo , Mrs. Peel . Congratulations . apollo ! You too , Steed . Welcome to The Danger Makers . - Good work . - Thank you . - What put you on to Manton ? - Stanhope . ah , yes ... Poor Stanhope ... What do you think of my set-up ? I 'm impressed . almost accidental . I was treating combat fatigue during the war . I found a small percentage , perhaps 1 % , suffered mental regression because they actually missed the shock of war . Grown used to it , conditioned . - and that set you thinking . - Yes . I kept wondering about the men who actually enjoyed the war . all that potential energy . Destructive energy . One could harness it . Direct it . I 've done it . Those men upstairs , I taught them to need danger . - To crave it . - Like drug addicts . It could be called an addiction to danger . Just as a drug addict always needs more and more ... It 's the same for the danger . Exactly . But chicken running , climbing St. Paul 's , it 's not enough . Nowthe biggest danger of all awaits me . The biggest prize . For centuries , men have dreamed of stealing the crown from the Tower . There have always been too many pitfalls , dangers . You follow me ? For my little band , the danger acts as a spur . They will face death . Some will die , but it doesn 't matter . It will only be sweeter . - When is this coup due to happen ? - Tomorrow . I issue fiinal instructions tonight . For the crime of the century . Of course ... you won 't be around to read about it . What a pity ... Good bye , Mr. Steed . - You want something ? - I 'm to kill you . Don 't be too proud of it . - I said : " I 'm to kill you . " - Oh , no ! British Tin is down a point . Stand up ! - Why ? - Because I 'm going to kill you . - I 'm more comfortable sitting . - Stand up ! I said : " Stand up . " Your hand isn 't shaking . Like a rock . Where 's the danger ? I 'm in handcuffs . There 's more danger in stamp collecting ! Now if we both had an equal chance ... Either side of the table . Gun in the middle . I could see the point . The chair , over there . Sit down . I 'll count to 3 . at 3 ... One ... Two ... Sorry , Major , I always cheat . Steed ! Give me that . - How did you get out ? - I knotted some sheets together . That old thing ! Originality didn 't seem important . Tomorrow , your mission will call for utmost courage . The Tower , gentlemen . Its riches . It is ours , nothing can stop us . You think so ? Three against one . Not very dangerous ! Let 's abide by our code . Reduce the odds to even . Single combat . Man to man . Me against the bravest of you . Your glorious leader . The doctor should give the example . Oh , dear ! Sorry , dear . I can 't stop . Boisterous boys ! apollo , he 's unarmed . He 's unarmed ! Tea up . Come and get it !

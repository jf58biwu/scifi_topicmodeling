Excuse me sister , Mrs. Steven want to check infusion of 212 . You must stay with the patient . This patient will be fine here , 5 minutes , as you do your job .

Something bothers me and I want to know what you know , honestly . Honestly ? Honestly . 400 years ago , a prophet to look to the future and saw someone special . Someone who can see the enemy dark around us ... I believe Nostradamus saw you you . What else did he say that Nostradamus ? That you help me defeat them . Two of us ? I think we can . I think we can defeat the enemy dark Batman . Alyinka need to know what you see . Be my guest . Some people look different to me than others . Can you see ! Dr Reid says that all people have a blind spot . But I did not . It 's like a new procedure or something . Alyinka today everything changes . - It will be something new , they know that you see ? - No . Must be a side effect . You have to get you out of here . Wait a moment . I 'm blind as I can remember , so do not even know what I see . But what I know is that people which talk to me and I played seem to work . How do I know you 're not the enemy dark ? You said something bothering you . When I went into surgery , I was sedated , but still awake . And where I went ... it was crazy . It smelled like rotten meat . If you can find that place and show you the truth ... Will you help me ? I thought you might wanna see this . Type diabetic who came yesterday . Look at the blood tests . He had blood alcohol , not even beer drunk . He had normal blood sugar level throughout the night . - What do you think ? - I think someone is playing with us . - Where is she now ? - Also in room 23 . The Council was convinced of the importance of human anatomy experiments ... First . Do not give them a reason to close the hospital . Redo analyzes . Sister , come here ! It was late at night , when I went down a corridor . When we stopped I heard a buzz . A basic disappear and appear . It was near an elevator and went . I think I fell . I counted 4 ' ding ' sites until we stopped . When I came down , I felt it was dirt and mold . I do not remember which way I went , but the water flowed over . I heard something ... a fizzle . As the wind . I was scared . Not just because of the operation ... But because I felt something . I do not know ... Alyinka are freaks ... experimenting on humans . It fel experienced ? Let 's say I found your donor , only that he did not sign the papers . - Let 's get you out of here . Come on . - Okay . - Wait . I can not leave . - What ? Tomorrow cornea to receive us . You can see everyone . Listen , Alyinka . They will not help you . Will you study . And when they finish studying , they 'll kill you . What ? Who are they " ? Do not believe me . All that matters is that seizes us . And you and I are the best hope that mankind has to stop . That said the great Nostradamus ? Yes , it is . No dead to tell me what to do . You can see them . This means you can save lives . If you are blessed with a gift and you 're wasting ... There 's nothing worse than that . Nothing worse . I doubt what Nostradamus predicted about me . Sometimes I lose my motivation . Then I see a place like this and had to do something . I was baby in mother 's arms , street when a bullet went through the bedroom window . I lost my eyes and I lost my mother . My brother , my sister and I went straight to the orphanage . Sorry for that . But that does not change your responsibility . You 're wrong Cade , they exchange . I learned from an early age that are responsible for one person ... for me . I will smite place . Then I 'll come back for you . Hey , hey , you 're not a doctor . I thought maybe ... No , I would not be realized . You investigator , is not it . The medical council . Why ? How do you know ? Honestly , this hospital has worsened throughout the year . Unsanitary working conditions , inpatients wrong , doctors weird walking around . The first time you saw me you thought you are a new doctor . I mean , it was an invasion of trainees here . Dre , Markovitz , I think part of the new doctors the group wants to take her to hospital . - A conspiracy , right ? - Yes . Da . How to trust me . I saw how you handled the old man next to me . You look different , you care . Did anyone ever told you ? You have gorgeous eyes . You have a noble concept on this planet ... Revelation , a kind of cosmic collision events from Trinity to God . No to discuss religion with an alien . Too bad , because you made me believe in revelation , from the moment you walked into custody . Foster . That 's right , we know who you are . In fact , the Council has planned to bring you as you study . But we 've spared the effort . Revelation ... Use the hospital to investigate people . People will find out . Nobody cares what happens in psychiatric hospitals . That 's why I chose Grace Hospital . Dr Markovitz knew that something 's wrong . Dr. Markovitz , was the last of the old doctors . Stubbornly refused a generous pension . Now ... Let 's get started . Who left the door open it . You had a bad dream , Alyinka . Damn ! The human eye fascinates me . People can see so much with him . Often information does not reach the brain . I do not know why . Alyinka needs a new cornea to see . Yours will only be good . Anything for a good deed . Each of here wants a piece of you , literally . I made the first choice . Let me see your creativity freaks . How do you do ? So how do your doctors ... Our doctors save lives ! Your medical discoveries were made less important species ... Rats , pigs , sheep , monkeys ... What do you think mean to me ? When you put this solution in your eyes you will lose your vision temporarily ... But I will not bother you . After all I 'll cut corneas . It might hurt a little . Cade ! - You are here Cade ! - Alyinka , run ! Should not have come , Alyinka . It was a dream , is not it ? I saw you in this room with the boy . - These are his eyes , eh ? - What counts . - You can see . - Yes ... It matters . Stupid girl ! You are half blind , what will I do ? I ran after me with a lighter ? You do not . My lighter will follow . - Are you okay ? - Yes . I can not see are blind . Where 's the dr . Reid ? I took care of it myself , I 'm sorry it came to this . Well ... Okay , put your arm around me . - You out . - I 'm dizzy . Okay . Easy ... What is it ? What happened ? Dr. Reid has disappeared , his body was right here . It 's okay Alyinka , alien corpse evaporated when he dies . - This aste . - E dr . Reid ! He did not die ! Find a weapon , find something . - Do you see ? - No not yet . We could use some light . - Where is it ? - I do not see it . Light is too strong , my glasses . Two blind rats . Two blind rats . Here 's how running ... Here 's how running ... - I smell ? - No , the whole room smells like rotten meat . Listen ! Listen ! It 's your right . Remember stretcher . - Let 's go ! - Wait . - I have not heard die . - I hear he dies ? The aliens make a noise when they die . Cade , that 's the sound ? Where are you ? What happens ? Cade ? What happens ? Speak to me ! Be my guest . I 'm here . Here are ... That 's strange burned ... - They destroyed the evidence . - And that 's not all ... After all the research ... We can not tell where hospital staff disappeared . We have one thing in all this . - On Alyikna . - Your ally . Not your ally . I need your help , Alyinka . Sorry Baths , to be a hero , it 's your job , not mine . Do I have a choice ? I can not close my eyes knowing what happens , I have to do something . Naturally , you are . I know who I am . Alyinka have eyes now . When you see the suffering of others , you change your mind . Nostradamus was referring ... At you . It 's your fate , you have a mission . Da , am . We mission to see his face for the first time my sister . Let me look into the eyes of my brother . Not what I meant . Do not you understand , right ? You said you doubt ... That you lost motivation . You seem to have a purpose now ... Check prophecies again Foster . I met the mission . Alyinka ! So I watched them leave ... Alyinka chose against her destiny predicted by Nostradamus . Or maybe not . Perhaps tip that helped me climb it was my doubts amount . Because I learned something about myself from Alyinka ... I 'm not fighting aliens to clear my name ... Or to avenge his wife 's death . Even for that Nostradamus predicted this . I fight because that 's me . And I will not give up until you win .

 Quinn , Jack . Your final assignment is classification red . At 3 : 05 P.M. , greenwich mean time , a truck loaded with 32 kilogras of nonactive plutonium ... Was stolen from a secured U.S. nuclear installation outside Croatia . We believe stavros and his organization ... Will sell it to the Iraqis within 24 hours . Your objective is to make sure the plutonium is returned safely to our base . Out of the way ! Urgent call for you , sir . Quinn 's in ! We have satellite confirmation that the xrt is mobile ! Wow ! This 'll be a ride . Quinn has 14 hours to reach the border . If he does make it , his resignation is final . Watch out ! Aaaaaah ! Aaaaaah ! Whoa ! Jack ! Would you get that ? Ohh ! Kathryn ! Your damn cow was in my way ! It 's not a cow , Jack . It 's a swan . Whatever it is , it 's in my way . In your way ? Your swan is beautiful . You 're beautiful . Ah , not for long , huh ? You 'll still be sexy . A bit rounder and a bit softer ... Jack , the baby ... it 's what we want , no ? Of course . Bonjour , Jack . You don 't believe in front doors ? There 's a back door too . You , of all people , should know that . Hey . How 'd you find me ? We never lost you , my friend . So you know I 'm retired . How long do you think you can sit on your ass and watch the sun set ? You 're a hunter , Jack . Admit it . You miss the game . You don 't get it . For me , it 's personal . For you , it 's politics . Politics makes money , brings you opportunities . Everything 's politics . You want personal ? I 'll give you personal . Stavros is back , and we want him alive . We want all his nasty information ... names , clients , escape routes . That 's why we need you . After all these years chasing him , you 're the only guy who knows how he works , how he moves . Come on , Jack . This is your last shot . We 've got a delta team prepped and waiting for you in antwerp . Face it , Jack : You can 't retire until he does . Is Quinn coming back or not ? I don 't know . Maybe he really is retired . If he is , we go to plan " b . " Capitan ! Move the seat up . It 's a little tight in the rear . But that 's generally true of the c.I.A. , isn 't it ? Si , capitan . Okay . So you bust a few drug cartels in third world countries ; You testify in front of congress ; They make you a deputy director ... get to the point . The point is , you 're nothing but a minor-leaguer . You were only good for one thing ... you got Quinn back in the game . That 'll be challenging . Pull over here . And by the way , I left you a present . Ohh ! Get me outta here ! Aaah ! Help ! Hey , ciao , Bella . You look fine ! Come on . Don 't tell me that it 's not dangerous . You 're gonna be back in 36 hours . ¶ I 'm looking for yaz . ¶ I 'm looking for yaz . Whoa . I 'll bet that hurt . That hurt . These hurt too . But I kinda like this one right here , though . Who are you ? I 'm the man . You ? I hope you don 't judge a person by the way he looks . I hate that . Who does your hair , siegfried or Roy ? The last guy who made fun of my hair is still trying to pull his head out of his ass . I don 't wanna know about your sex life . Well , this has been fun . Now , who in the hell are you ? Jack Quinn . If you wanna dance , ask me nicely . I just wanted to check and see if it 's you , Mr. Quinn . Damn . The legend walks . I heard you dropped out of the game , Jack . ¶ Whoa . Santa 's workshop . Who 's that ? Rudolph ? I may not have reindeer , but I do have the best elves in the business . Christmas shopping for bad boys ? I don 't play with the bad boys anymore . Only the good guys , baby . Just tell me what you need . I got shit here so new , even I don 't know I have it . Offense gets the glory . But defense wins the game . I take cash , gold ... did you open that ? Yeah . Fire in the hole ! But I don 't take personal checks . I have a rule here . You break it , you bought it . Got it ? Gentlemen , this is delta one . Forget you 've ever seen him . This is Mr. yamir . He has information that stavros will be surfacing tomorrow afternoon ... Somewhere around here . An amusement park . Huh . - Who 's my deadeye ? - That would be me , sir . Know how to use it ? It 's been modified to shoot tranquilizer darts . Can you shoot a man at 200 yards with that ? With this , I can shoot the dick off a hummingbird . He 's like a snake . If you look into his eyes , he 'll get you in the back . When we I.D. Stavros , move into position . We only have one shot . Two darts will kill a man ; Three will kill a rhino ; And we want stavros alive . ¶ Ho-ho-ho-ho ! ¶ Delta five , check the two arab women by the carousel . On it . Something 's happening . Bravo one , we have stavros . North lot , gray Mercedes . I 've got three men moving . The driver 's staying with the car . Let him in , bravo . Delta two and five , move to Baker . - The rest of you hold . - Roger , delta one . What a night to do this . It had to be tonight . This is way too easy . He 's in my sights . I have clear coverage on him . Ready to fire . That 's not stavros ! He 's a lefty ! - Stavros is a lefty ! - Sir ? It 's not him ! The driver ! Find the driver ! En route to ground position . Come on , my friends ! Come on ! Come on ! Here we go ! That 's right ! We 're securing the exits . I got him . Roger . At the tiger cage . Who 's the woman ? She 's hiding something . It could be a bomb . My God . I 've locked on , delta one . Delta two and five in position , sir . We 're ready to take him . Delta one . What are you waiting for , delta one ? Ready to move in . Delta one , I 'm waiting for your command . You have your shot . What are you waiting for ? Stavros is on the move ! - Clear out ! Clear out ! - Too late , clown boy . Move into position , three ! Whoa ! Aaah ! Aaaah ! His mother told me ... That his favorite thing in the world ... Used to be ... When he 'd go riding his little pony on the weekends . He loved riding that little horse . Little horse gonna miss my boy . I am a professional , Quinn . I 've killed . I 've killed a lot . But most of the bastards I 've killed ... Deserved to die . My little boy was six years old , mister . My little boy was six years old . Now , that makes it personal , mister . Candidate for colony residency . Quinn , Jack Paul . 1959 . Entered foreign service at 22 . Demolitions , tracking , psychological countermeasures . Antiterrorism . Stavros acquisition . Video segment a-19 : Antwerp interdiction . Agent Quinn achieved clean opportunity to acquire Alpha , but target Alpha escaped . You went soft . Soft agents are a liability . But because of your skills , you 've been assigned to the colony . No ! If you fail to cooperate , Mr. Quinn , you have an alternative . Nerve gas is quite painless , but effective . But why bother ? You 're dead already . At least that 's what your wife and the rest of the world have been told . If you wish to live , just put your thumbprint on the scanner next to the TV . Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two ... Identity confirmed . Thank you , Mr. Quinn . - Yaaaaah ! - Now , about ... Jack . Glad you decided to join us . Alex goldsmythe . The tax man . You were killed s-s-six years ago . God ! It 's been six years already ? Oh , well . Climb on board . Some friends are waiting to meet you . Gentlemen . Come and meet the famed Jack Quinn . Moishe levant . You died in Lebanon . Beirut , actually . Everybody ... All agents ... Or ex-agents . Or ex-enemies . We 're too valuable to kill and too dangerous to set free . Welcome to the colony . Quinn . Staal . I understand . Don 't ! This violence is not approved ! I thought I killed him in tuzla . Apparently , not well enough . I really dislike that man . Jack , you must wear this at all times . Simple device , really . Part pager , part timer . Lets you know where to be and for how long . When you hear it signal , you must respond . We 're a think tank , Jack . We 're linked into every law enforcement database in the world . We analyze terrorist incidents ... And recommend responses to our client governments . We are the last line of defense against global terrorism , and nobody even knows we exist . Ah . What 's on the menu for today ? What you 're seeing is the wreckage of a global air 747 ... En route from San Francisco to seoul , South Korea . Our image generator is interpreting signals from the crash site . Headset on . Hand on the scanner at all times . Attention . We have a feed coming in from Washington , D.C. I have a brief statement from the secretary concerning the global air tragedy , but I won 't be taking any questions . Of the 176 passengers onboard the flight , there are no survivors . The c.I.A. Is reporting the plane was downed by the north Koreans ... In an unprovoked and deliberate terrorist attack . The secretary stands by this assessment and will hold a briefing later this evening ... Regarding the United States ' response . The Koreans are denying responsibility , while the American president consults his allies . Jack , your continued usefulness ... Depends on your ability to analyze and interpret incoming data during times of crisis . This is the colony 's reason to exist , Jack . Thank you . The plane explodes from internal malfunction . Very fast . It 's gone . We 've just intercepted a transmission ... Of global 277 's cockpit voice recorder . Pacific center , we 've got unscheduled traffic at heading three-two-niner ... My , my . Not a pleasant prospect , the Koreans having that technology . Anyone with an alternative ? Anyone ? Analysis confirms the report . Moishe . You buy it ? I 'm not sure . He 's lying . He 's covering something up . They must know something about the shoot-down . Let 's reexamine the satellite images . Hold it there . What 's that ? Look . It 's a shadow . Bingo ! An awac . No , an f-4 weasel . Recreate the computer simulation to include this new possibility . If it flew close enough , it might be hidden from their scanners . North Koreans pick up the f-4 on radar ... But shoot down the passenger jet . The Americans were using the jumbo jet as cover ... For a data recon on a weapons test . They were set up so the Americans could eavesdrop on a military base . Inspired . Nice call , Jack . Underwater lasers . Lasers . Starting one meter below the surface , interlocking lasers destroy anything they contact . The lasers don 't get you , the undertow will . They 've thought of everything , Jack . No one ever escaped ? No one ? No one . Last one to try was a chap named Bryce . This was before the lasers were installed . Poor fellow didn 't survive 48 hours . His guardian took care of him . Each resident is assigned a guardian . Never know who he is . It 's the guardian 's job to observe his assignment 's attitude , behavior , production , that sort of thing . If a resident escapes , the guardian is sent to terminate him . How did you hide this place for so long ? Masking devices . We 're virtually invisible . Hello , Kathryn . Kathryn ? H-hello ? Uh , I hope I 'm not disturbing you . Can we talk ? Yes . This is Maria trifioli from the galleria luna in Rome . We spoke last week . Wonderful news . We 'd like to arrange an exhibition of your sculptures . You are surprised , yes ? I understand . I 'll tell you what . I 'll send you a plane ticket by messenger in the morning . You have 5 minutes to check in at your cottages , gentlemen . Let 's go inside . Seven , six , five , Four , three , two , one ... Thank you , Mr. Quinn . Please remain in contact until cleared . Lasers have been disengaged . Roger ! Come around ! Okay , all in . E signora , e quattordicimila lire , per piacere . Grazie . Hi . I 'm Maria trifioli . We spoke on the phone . - Yes . - Well , I 'm glad you accepted our proposal . I 'm flattered . It 's very generous , but you know , it will be so difficult for me to ... you mean you don 't want to show your work here ? You have other offers ? No . It 's been only four months since my husband ... it must be hard for you , I know , but perhaps this will open a new chapter in your life . No , the problem is moving to Rome . I 'd have to sell the cottage . Rome is so expensive . You must stay with us at the Regina . We have plenty of room . I 'll make sure you and the baby have nothing but the best care in Rome . Tonight you 'll meet the gallery owner . He 's been waiting a long time to meet you . This has all the earmarks of a stavros operation . It confirms our earlier intelligence regarding stavros ' current activities . What we need to know is , who is paying for his talents . In view of this , we anxiously await your analysis of this event . What 's unusual is , no one 's claimed responsibility . Barcelona . The Algerians have been flexing muscle there recently . The Algerians can 't afford stavros . Maybe it 's personal vengeance . Stavros working on his own . That 's not his style . Why would he ? Suppose it was some psycho , a random act . Several groups have been active lately in Spain . What do you think , Jack ? Jack ? - No . - No ? Jack , we 're awaiting your comment . It 's not sta ... stavros . It 's a copycat . I had my chance at stavros . I also failed . He is my last unpaid debt . Now he 's running around loose and I 'm stuck on this rock . You were our last great hope , the last one still playing the game ... Who was good enough to get him . What does he know about this place ? We 're not sure . That 's why he 's so dangerous . Agencies around the world used his services ... When they needed someone with the stomach for difficult work . It 's ironic , really . When he was our ally , he was considered heroic . Now he works for someone else , he 's a scalawag . He 's fallen out of fashion . I 'm afraid we 've , uh , had to part with your beautiful swan . I took the liberty of , uh , doubling the price . My husband loved that swan . He thought it was a cow . Yaaah ! Yeah . You have five minutes to check in at your cottages , gentlemen . Five , four , three , two ... Thank you , Mr. Quinn . Get moving ! All right , let 's go . On our way ! Whoo ! Henri , I need help with these cables . Henri , what can we do here ? Yeah , I see it . Give me some slack . Pull ! What ? Hey ! - Do you have a parachute ? - Yes ! Gentlemen , fasten your seat belts . We 'll be landing soon . Who is his guardian ? - Boo . - Damn . Where 'd you come from ? I heard they made you disappear . I need merchandise . Sorry . I 'm closed for the night . You 're open now . Let 's talk . I need some mean toys . I got somethin ' new here you 're gonna love . It 'll make you the baddest boy on the block . Guaranteed . Check this out . Laser sight , fully automatic . You gonna need a holster for that gun . - Oh , these are nice . - Can you fly a plane ? Like a bird . But my ass is staying on the ground , brother . I 'm havin ' a sale on new gas grenades . - You bring cash ? - I 'll pay you later . Oops . I just declared a seven-day cooling-off period . Thank you very much . You know I 'm good for it . Sorry , brother . You outta the game . Dead men don 't get credit . I 'll give you three c.I.A. Bank account numbers . When I get the merchandise , I 'll give you the access codes . I don 't know , man . I look at you , I see nothing but trouble . What the hell . I kinda like trouble . What do you mean , " no parachute " ? My creation is better than a parachute . - Now , are you sure this works ? - Of course it works . You sure ? Of course . I 'm positive it works . Yeah ? Yeah . Look , you die , you get a full refund . Trust me . Good luck . Thanks . I 'm gonna murder you ! Give me a hand here . How about a foot ? Is that the best you can do ? - Let 's try something else . - That 's love , baby . Hey ! Watch your hands ! Now , that 's what I call " hang time . " What 's wrong with you ? Are you nuts ? You 're crazy , man . You 're crazier than my hairstylist . - Did you test it ? Did you ? - I don 't need to test it . I built it ! I 'll see you back at the shop . And maybe I 'll give you the access codes . What do you mean " maybe " ? Trust me ! Bite me ! ¶ Yes , Kathryn . I 'm coming . One moment . - Stay down ! - Get up on him ! ... Hotel navona in Rome . Your baby 's due tomorrow . That 's his heartbeat . Listen , don 't be late . Oh , I wouldn 't take this car . It rides a bit bumpy . Oh , I 'm glad to see you can still play . You know , if I were you , I 'd check into the hotel navona in Rome . Your baby 's due tomorrow . That 's his heartbeat . Listen , don 't be late . Oh , I wouldn 't take this car . It rides a bit bumpy . Oh , I 'm glad to see you can still play . You know , if I were you , I 'd check into the hotel navona in Rome . Your baby 's due tomorrow . That 's his heartbeat . Listen , don 't be late . Oh , I wouldn 't take this car . It rides a bit bumpy . Oops ! Don 't spoil the paint job . Thanks . " Thanks " ? I 'm just protecting my investment . Dude , this is a little too dangerous for me . I want the numbers . I want ' em now . This car is rigged . I need transportation to Rome . Transportation , you say ? I have some connections in this area . I told you . If they can make it , I can steal it . Why didn 't you steal something bigger ? I figured you 'd want to blend in . So that explains your clothes . What 's wrong with my clothes ? You look like a carrot with earrings . Damn bicycles . Get out of the way ! Hey ! You 're blocking ' the Lane ! I picked them up . They 're entering the autostrada to Rome . That checks with our latest information . Quinn 's wife is now reported to be at the hotel Regina . Splendid . We 've got a game going . Oh , I love you so much . Oh , you love everybody . And you 're a wonderful dancer . Bring it around to the rear of the hotel . Anything for Jack Quinn ? Si , signore . Right here . Thanks . Yes , come to the back of the hotel . We 'll have the bellman there to meet you . Si . This was waitin ' for you at the front desk , Quinn . Well , it 's not a bomb . Maybe it 's the access codes . I would love to get paid . Those bank accounts are fronts . Empty . That figures , Quinn . Why you lyin ' to me ? I bet the colony doesn 't even exist , does it ? It 's not about the colony . What the hell is this ? A sonogram of my son . Stavros has my boy . You go back to antwerp . I 'll get your money . I pay my debts . Quinn , keep your money . Why you didn 't tell me this before ? What do you care ? You always play defense , right ? It 's time to get off the bench . The best defense is a strong offense . Right ? Right . Stavros has been making the rules . If we play his game , my wife and son are dead . You 're gonna send an e-mail message ? That 's going to be intercepted by every agency in Europe . What 's the plan ? I don 't have one . But stavros doesn 't know that , so he 'll do what he thinks I would do . So he has to check it out . And when he does , it 'll take us right to Kathryn . Stavros . Look at this . Ah . Quinn 's clever . A very sensitive man . Another time , another place . It 's just too late . I 'm takin ' you to the hospital . You 'll be safer there . I copy that . I 'm in position . - Here , sir . Give a look . - I am blocked . Repeat ... this is a circus . Everybody 's here . There 's the Mossad . - Some local boys on the corner . - Nothing here . Even the carabinieri . Holy cow . It 's a full house . How 's pedestrians ? Pardon me . Pardon me . Hey , keep movin ' , buddy . Whew ! ¶ So , um , it seems your plan isn 't working . Patience . He 'll be here . If we need help , I have a brother . You have a brother ? Yes , I have a brother ... the St. clemente chapel . Quinn , no ! That 's what he wants ! Kathryn ! No ! You know somethin ' , Jack ? I never break a promise . Never . I don 't want you to worry about it . I promise you I 'll send you an invitation to the baby 's christening . Think about wearing black . Let my wife go . Take me . Well , actually , Jack , I think I 'm gonna take all three of you . No visual . - I got stavros and Quinn . - I have a clear line . Over . Repeat . Over . Repeat . Hyah ! Sniper on the roof ! Aaah ! Hyah ! - You 're out of the game . - You sure ? He 's up . He 's in ! I would have to call that a five-pointer . Hey ! - Where 's my wife ? - I don 't know what you 're talking about , man . LA policia . Jack ? Where 's Jack ? Don 't worry , Kathryn . Everything will be fine . Who are you people ? Move . Jack 's coming . Take care of business . I don 't want him to know what day it is . Buona sera , friar . I 'm looking for a guy named ... shh . I 've never seen walls like this . What is this ? The bones of my brothers . You are a friend of brother yaz . He has done many favors for our order , including a mainframe processor ... That must be seen to be believed . - What 's up ? - What 's up ? This is my brother regulo and my brother ramulu . This is my brother Quinn . These monks have been collecting information on Rome for 500 years . This system has been really updated . Cybermonks . That prescription label you found ? He 's tracing ' it right now . Oh , yes . Ma che cos 'é questo ? Che significa ? Chi ce I 'ha messo ? Oh . Uh ... Internet . Some 27 doctors prescribed this same medication ... In the last few days . Ma che cosa succede ? - It 's an outside signal . - Is it going to crash ? Where in heaven did that come from ? May I ? Incoming message . " Thanks for the blessing . Jack . " He 's down there somewhere . Man ! These antiques are worth a fortune ! In the spiritual sense . We are now under the tiber river . This branch of the tunnel will lead down to the island of tiberi . It 's the only way to get to the hospital without using the bridge . So that 's where stavros will place his men . Good luck . Yes . Good luck . Thank you , brothers . Catch you on the Internet , my brothers . I 'll wait for your e-mail . Okay , push . Push ! Okay . Like that . Push ! Push ! Damn ! It 's stuck ! - Maybe I have something in my pocket . - What do you have ? What 's that ? My lucky coin , and my lucky detonator , and my lucky plastic explosive . Semtex . That 's the stuff . Handier than duct tape . Preparation , my friend . You gotta have the right tool for the job . You gotta be prepared for anything . - Damn ! Not enough wire . - Huh ? Preparation , huh ? Hold on . Let 's find a rock . You don 't mind , do you , man ? It 's for a good cause . Thanks . Oops . Air ball . You need practice , man . I hate practice , but I never miss twice , brother . Oh ... my baby . He 's on the island . Of course he is . I need time . Give me 60 seconds . Then kill both the women . Up there . Go . Go . Go . Hey , be careful . You gonna wind up in the hospital . Did you hear something ? - Where ? - Up there . Hey ! Hey ... agh ! It 's me ! It 's me ! It 's you . It 's you . Come on . This hospital , it 's awfully quiet . You take care of it . They 're over here ! I heard them ! Go ! Marco , what are you doing just standing ... This is a hospital . No running , please . Shh ! Quiet . Lemme help you down . Jack ? What 's go ... what 's going on ? No , Jack ! She saved me . They said you were dead . It 's okay . I 'm here . Mm-hmm . I 'm here . It 's okay . Stavros . Where is he ? Where 's our son ? Aaaah ! - Where 's my son ? - I know where they are . You go get your boy . I 'll take care of her . Thank you . You owe me . Get rid of it , or the party 's over . You know , Jack ... I can call you " Jack , " can 't I ? I bet you there 's not a single night you can close your eyes tight enough ... Without seeing my little boy 's face . I 'm going to give you a chance to save your son . If you live today , you 'll get to know your son . And if you don 't , I 'll raise him as my own . You know , men are strong , Jack , but the tiger is stronger . Watch your step , Jack . You know , nothing wrong with stepping on a mine . It 's stepping off that counts . Hah ! Come on ! Come on ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Quinn ! Where did he come from ? Yaz ! The crosses ! They 're mines ! Don 't you go off and party without me , okay ? I 'll be back . Got you ! Jack ! The baby 's safe . Let 's get the hell outta here . This place is gonna blow . You take care of my son . I 'll take care of stavros . Lift your foot , my tall friend , and that mine will turn you into red paint . You got ... Big feet , Mr. Quinn . You gotta be careful where you put them . Looks like you 're the bitch now , stavros . I forgot to tell you . I hope you don 't mind . You went through a lot of trouble digging ' these holes , putting up these markers , and I know mines don 't come cheap . But I moved a couple of your crosses . Sorry . Yaz ! Behind you ! Oh , sh ... Yaz , where 's my son ? Where is he ? I 'm lookin ' ! I 'm lookin ' ! He was right here ! Jack ! Is everybody okay ? It 's me . Daddy . Yeah . I want to remember my Roman holiday . Give me a souvenir . Cut a piece of your hair . Oh , and your shirt . Quinn , you may like this . Here 's a souvenir from me . Maybe my coin will be lucky for you too . I 'm not givin ' you any pieces of my hair , Mr. goldsmythe . Quite a magician , Mr. yaz . Now it 's my turn to disappear . - Toodle-oo . - " Toodle-oo " ? Well , you can bet your ass they 'll blame me for this one .

IN CASE OF TROUBLE , I CAN FLING MYSELF INTO ACTION AT A MOMENT 'S NOTICE ON YOUR BEHALF . STILL , THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR EXPLORING ON OUR OWN FOR A WHILE . I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF . I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT THE COMPANY , BUT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR IN MIND , LIKE MAYBE EXPLORING THE DARK , SEAMY SIDE OF THE STATION . DOCTOR .

THERE 'S NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY SHOUTING . NOW ... AMBASSADOR , PERHAPS IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEEXCALIBUR CAN 'T LAND ON LORKA 7 . WHILE SOME OF OUR REBELS IN THAT AREA OF SPACE ARE BRAKIRI COLONIES , OTHERS ARE UNDER OUR JURISDICTION ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF MUTUAL DEFENSE . WE ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT ATTACKED OR INVADED IN EXCHANGE FOR 10 % OF THEIR ANNUAL PLANETARY INCOME . OTHER THAN THAT , WE LEAVE THEM ALONE . WE DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTERNAL POLICIES , AND ONE SUCH POLICY IS THAT NO OUTSIDERS MAY LAND ON LORKA 7 . THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO . YOU WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE LORKANS YOURSELF AND TRY AND WORK SOMETHING OUT . AMBASSADOR , WE HAVE LITTLE OVER 4 YEARS TO FIND A CURE TO THE PLAGUE THAT HIT EARTH . IF WE DON 'T , EVERY MAN , WOMAN , AND CHILD ON EARTH DIES . THAT IS WHY WE SIGNED TREATIES WITH EVERY MAJOR ALIEN GOVERNMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE . SO WE WOULDN 'T HAVE TO STOP AND NEGOTIATE AT EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY ! THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO EVERY RULE , CAPTAIN . THIS IS ONE OF THEM . GREAT ! HOW MANY OTHER EXCEPTIONS ARE THERE ?

COMPLETE IDIOT . AND HE LEFT HERE AN HOUR AGO . AND HE LEFT HERE AN HOUR AGO . WELL , THEN I HAVE SOME NEWS THAT 'LL CHEER YOU UP . YOU FOUND ME SOMEBODY TO TALK TO ? BECAUSE TECHNICALLY THE LORKANS ARE IN BRAKIRI SPACE , THEY DON 'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL AMBASSADOR , BUT THEY DO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE HERE . I HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM ON YOUR BEHALF , AND THEY 'VE AGREED TO A MEETING . BUT I WOULDN 'T HOLD MY BREATH ABOUT BEING ALLOWED TO LAND . THEY CAN BE PRETTY STUBBORN . I CAN BE PRETTY STUBBORN MYSELF . I CAN BE PRETTY STUBBORN MYSELF . WELL , THANKS . ALL PART OF THE SERVICE . SO TELL ME , WHY IS THIS PLANET SO IMPORTANT TO YOUR SEARCH FOR A CURE ? IT 'S A LONG STORY . IT 'S A LONG STORY . WELL , THEN YOU CAN TELL ME OVER DINNER . WELL , THEN YOU CAN TELL ME OVER DINNER . LISTEN , AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED LAST TIME , IT 'S THE LEAST I CAN DO . AND I KNOW A GREAT PLACE .

GOT THE NEIGHBORS LOOKING AFTER HIM WHILE I 'M GONE . I WAS SURPRISED YOU AGREED TO SEE ME . I WAS GOING TO BE IN THE AREA . IT 'S NO BIG DEAL . SO WHAT 'S WRONG ? SO WHAT 'S WRONG ? I NEED MONEY , MAX . MM-HMM . HOW MUCH ? 100,000 CREDITS . 100,000--CYNTHIA ! MAX , MOST OF MY INCOME CAME FROM SELLING ALIEN ARTWORK AND POTTERY BACK HOME . THE QUARANTINE COMPLETELY KILLED BUSINESS . I TRIED TO TAKE OUT A LOAN , BUT WITH THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY , EVERYBODY WAS SHORT . EARTH CREDITS WERE FALLING IN THE EXCHANGE RATES , THE BANKS WOULDN 'T GIVE ME ANYTHING . THE BANKS WOULDN 'T GIVE ME ANYTHING . I HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER SOURCE FOR THE MONEY . TELL ME THIS ISN 'T GOING WHERE I THINK IT 'S GOING . AN INDEPENDENT . A CROOK . I DIDN 'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE , MAX .

BUT I 'M NOT PAYING HIM 100,000 CREDITS . 50 , YES , TO TAKE CARE OF THE DEBT , BUT NOT THE REST . MAX , THIS IS MY LIFE WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE . HOW CAN YOU PUT MONEY OVER MY SAFETY ? HOW CAN YOU PUT MONEY OVER MY SAFETY ? IT 'S THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING . RIGHT ! GREAT ! I 'LL MAKE SURE THAT 'S ENGRAVED ON MY TOMBSTONE ! I 'LL MAKE SURE THAT 'S ENGRAVED ON MY TOMBSTONE ! WHAT 'S IMPORTANT ABOUT LORKA 7 IS THAT IT 'S A ... A RESETTLED PLANET . THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS DIED OFF A LONG TIME AGO . 500 YEARS AGO , COLONY SHIPS ARRIVED FROM ANOTHER PLANET IN THE AREA , AND THE CURRENT POPULATION HAS MOVED INTO THE ABANDONED RUINS , MADE IT THEIR OWN . SO YOU THINK THAT WHATEVER KILLED OFF THE ORIGINAL POPULATION IS THE SAME THING THAT HIT EARTH ? I DON 'T KNOW . THEY WON 'T RELEASE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT SUBJECT . THAT 'S WHY WE HAVE TO GO THERE AND FIND OUT . BUT EVEN IF THEY DIDN 'T DIE FROM THE SAME THING , WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THEY LEFT BEHIND IN THE RUINS ? WELL , THAT DOES EXPLAIN A FEW THINGS . YOU KNOW , ON A PERSONAL LEVEL , THE LORKANS HAVE ALWAYS SEEMED ... LESS ADVANCED THAN THEIR TECHNOLOGY WOULD IMPLY . BECAUSE THEY DIDN 'T INVENT THE STUFF . THEY JUST FOUND IT . THEY JUST FOUND IT . THEY 'VE GOT TO LET US LAND THERE AND CHECK THE PLACE OUT . THEY 'VE GOT TO LET US LAND THERE AND CHECK THE PLACE OUT . I DON 'T KNOW . SOME DAYS IT 'S LIKE TRYING TO ... NAIL SMOKE TO THE WALL . I MEAN , THE JOB IS HARD ENOUGH . WHY DOES EVERYBODY KEEP TRYING TO MAKE IT HARDER THAN IT HAS TO BE ? THE BIGGER THE JOB , THE MORE OF A TARGET YOU BECOME . MMM . SAVING EARTH . THAT 'S A PRETTY BIG JOB . HOW YOU HANDLING IT ? HOW YOU HANDLING IT ? BETTER . THANKS TO SEEING YOU . BETTER . THANKS TO SEEING YOU . SO , UM , AHEM ... WHAT WILL YOU DO IF THE LORKANS REFUSE YOUR REQUEST ? FIND ANOTHER WAY . I DIDN 'T GET THIS FAR BY GIVING IN . I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT IF YOU CAN 'T GET IN THE FRONT DOOR , YOU GO IN THE BACK DOOR . GO OVER ' EM , TUNNEL UNDER ' EM , YOU GO AROUND ' EM , BUT YOU- - YOU GO AROUND ' EM , BUT YOU- - GET THE JOB DONE . GET THE JOB DONE . IT IS AS I SAID , POLIX . THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED . AND WE CANNOT TOLERATE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE . I AGREE . SO ... WHAT ARE WE TO DO ? SO ... WHAT ARE WE TO DO ? HE SAID THAT HE WILL FIND A WAY . HMM ... ANOTHER MIGHT NOT PROVE SO ... PERSISTENT .

I LOVE GAMES . GIVE ME A CHANNEL BACK HOME . GIVE ME A CHANNEL BACK HOME . AND SO ... THE MOST HOLY ... APPEARED TO OUR PEOPLE 500 OF YOUR YEARS AGO . HE DECLARED THAT THOSE OF US WHO WERE WITHOUT SIN , WHO WERE WITHOUT CORRUPTION , WOULD BE LED TO A PROMISED LAND . AND THAT WOULD BE LORKA 7 . EXACTLY . AND THERE WE FOUND THE GREAT MACHINES AND SECRETS AND MYSTERIES THAT WERE TO BE REVEALEDONLYTO US . THE MOST HOLY ...

PROPHECY STATES THAT IT IS OURS AS LONG AS WE WHO LIVE THERE REMAIN PURE AND WITHOUT CORRUPTION . YES . I STILL HAVEN 'T HEARD A REASON WHY WE CAN 'T LAND ON YOUR WORLD . WELL- - WE HAVE MAINTAINED OUR PURITY AS A PEOPLE BY INSURINGTHATNO ... OUTSIDERS COME TO OUR WORLD . IF WE WERE TO ALLOW YOU TO LAND , WE RISK DESTROYING ALL THAT THE MOST HOLY HAS GIVEN US . THEN HOW CAN YOU COME HERE AND LIVE ON BABYLON 5 ? I MEAN , AREN 'T YOU WORRIED WE MIGHT CORRUPT YOU JUST AS EASILY HERE AS BACK HOME ? NO . NO , NO , NO . IT IS NOT WE WHO ARE AT ISSUE HERE . WE ARE ABOVE CORRUPTION . ABOVE TEMPTATION . BECAUSE OF OUR OWN PURITY , WE MAY WALK AMONGST YOU WITHOUT BEING AFFECTED . BUT IF YOU WERE TO COME TO OUR WORLD , WITH ALL OF YOUR ... WITH ALL OF YOUR ... IMPURITIES ... AND YOUR INNATE CORRUPTION , YOU WOULD TAINT LORKA 7 , DESTROY THE COVENANT OF THE MOST HOLY ! OF THE MOST HOLY ! AND OUR PEOPLE WOULD FALL FROM GRACE . SO YOU SEE ... WE FEEL FOR YOUR PEOPLE ... BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE . I CAN 'T BELIEVE YOU , MAX ! HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME ? [ LAUGHS ] DO WHAT ? YOU ASKED ME TO HELP , I HELPED . ALL I NEEDED WAS THE MONEY . I DIDN 'T ASK YOU TO INTERFERE . YOU CAN 'T EXPECT ME TO HAND OVER 100,000 CREDITS . THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO . I DIDN 'T DO IT .

APPARENTLY , FOR SEVERAL YEARS , THEY HAD BEEN SELLING THE TECHNOLOGY WE FOUND ON LORKA 7 TO ALIEN RACES AND KEEPING THE PROFITS FOR THEMSELVES . THEY WERE AFRAID THAT IF YOU CAME AND BEGAN INVESTIGATING OUR WORLD , YOU WOULD DISCOVER THEIR ACTIVITIES . I 'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT . NOT AS SORRY AS WE ARE . WE HAD SENT THEM HERE AS EMISSARIES , NOT JUST OF OUR PEOPLE , BUT OF THE MOST HOLY ... AS TWO EXAMPLES OF OUR OWN MORAL AND ETHICAL SUPERIORITY . IF THE LEADERS OF OUR RELIGION CANNOT MAINTAIN THEIR VOWS IN THE FACE OF TEMPTATION , IF THEY DO NOT EMBODY ALL THE PRINCIPLES THEY TELL OTHERS TO OBEY , THEN PERHAPS IT IS TIME TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS FLAWED . WHAT TEMPTATION ? WHAT TEMPTATION ? UH ... THEY ARE SAYING IT WAS BEING EXPOSED TO YOUR CORRUPTION THAT LED TO THEIR DOWNFALL . THEN WE 'RE RIGHT BACK WHERE WE STARTED . WE CAN 'T LAND BECAUSE WE 'RE NOT MORALLY PERFECT . OH , NO . I HAVE SPOKEN TO OUR LEADERS BACK HOME , AND THEY WANT YOU TO COME . YES , THEY WANT YOU TO LAND ON OUR WORLD AND MOVE FREELY AMONG US . SEE ? THEY 'VE DECIDED WE 'RE NOT AS BAD AS THEY THOUGHT . NOT CORRECT . MUCH THE OPPOSITE , IN FACT . WHAT IS MORAL SUPERIORITY WITHOUT TEMPTATION ? WITHOUT SOMETHING TO TEST OUR FAITH , WE HAVE GROWN COMPLACENT , AND WE HAVE SEEN THE RESULTS WITH THE TWO WHO TRIED TO KILL YOU . NO . INTERACTING WITH A SPECIES AS CORRUPT AS YOURS WILL BE THE SUPREME TEST OF OUR FAITH . WILL BE THE SUPREME TEST OF OUR FAITH . THANK YOU . I WILL TELL THEM TO PREPARE FOR YOUR ARRIVAL . IN THE NAME OF THE MOST HOLY ... IN THE NAME OF THE MOST HOLY ... GOOD DAY . GOOD DAY . CAN I SMACK HIM , JUST ONCE ? [ LAUGHS ] NO . I NEVER GET TO HAVE ANY FUN . OH . SORRY . ALMOSTNEVER GET TO HAVE ANY FUN . UH , SPEAKING OF WHICH- - AND I THINK WE SHOULD BEFORE YOU LEAVE ... AND I THINK WE SHOULD BEFORE YOU LEAVE ...

 Let 's get this show on the road . Federal agents ! Get down ! Get down ! Turn this thing off . You 're Pusher , I presume . You must be Frank Burst . You know , I got to tell you , you got the greatest name . Agent Collins , read him his rights and let 's get him - out of here . - You have the right to remain silent . If you choose to give up that right , anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law ... Think you can hold me ? I want him in a waist chain and leg irons . I want him in a car with a cage ... Loudoun County unit , whatever . I 'll ride shotgun . You know , it 'd really help me out if you gave us your name . Pusher 's good enough . You know , Deputy , I just got to say that your uniform is really the most soothing shade of blue . I 'm not kidding you . I notice those things . It 's a sky blue . Very calming . Very tranquil . I think the word for that particular shade is cerulean , actually . Cerulean blue . Okay , okay . We get it . It 's a nice shade of blue . Cerulean blue . Cerulean makes me think of a breeze . A gentle breeze . Hey , Mr. Blackwell , put a sock in it . Cerulean is a gentle breeze . Cerulean , a gentle breeze . Stop ! When the truck hit us , I was knocked unconscious . Deputy Scott Kerber was mortally injured . Before he succumbed , he managed to pull himself out of the car , dig his keys out of his pocket , and his last breath was spent unlocking my prisoner , who , despite his own injuries , managed to escape on foot . Calls himself " Pusher . " What 's his story ? He cold-called me about a month ago . Confessed to a series of contract killings going back over the course of two years . He wanted to turn himself in ? No . It was a game . He was bragging . See , the thing about these murders is nobody considers them murders . They went down in the books as suicides . So you think he was just a crank ? No . He knows too much about each case , too many details that were only in the police reports . What connection did this dead deputy have with him ? None , as far as I can tell . Kerber was a good cop . Then why did he free him ? Pusher kept rambling about cerulean blue . Kept saying how it reminded him of a breeze or something . " Cerulean blue is like a gentle breeze , " over and over , and then , uh , Kerber pulled into the truck , and blammo . So you think that Pusher somehow talked him into doing this ? He willed him into doing that ? Willed him ? How ? No kidding . How ? Your guess is as good as mine on this one . See , Pusher likes to leave clues . " Ronin . " " Ro-neen . " It 's a samurai without a master . What ? You never saw Yojimbo ? Still , what does it mean ? Means I bet I know , ten-to-one , what this guy 's got stacked on the back of his toilet . Agents . Oh , thanks . Here 's volume ten . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't help noticing . I was in Georgetown this weekend . Guy knocked me down , stole my purse . They get him ? Do they ever ? No offense . Excuse me . Mulder , I 'm still not sure what we 're looking for . Samurais without masters have to advertise . Yes , but advertise for what ? I mean , how ... how did this Pusher convince an otherwise honest deputy sheriff to free him ? I mean , I 'm sure you have a theory . Suggestion is a powerful force . The science of hypnosis is predicated on it , as are most TV commercials . I mean , they 're designed to plant thoughts in your head . Inducing someone to buy hair color is a little different than inducing them to drive in front of a speeding truck . But the mechanism of suggestion is the same . It 's just a lot more powerful in this case . I mean , this guy calls himself " Pusher . " Can 't we take that to mean that he pushes his will onto other people ? Well , even if he could push his will , why would he cause an accident when he himself was in the car ? Maybe he really didn 't want to go to jail . Look at this . " I solve problems . O-S-U . " O-S-U . Ohio State University ? No , it 's a Northern Virginia area code . I 've seen this ad in all these magazines dating back to April 1994 . The time span of the murders . O-S-U . O-S ... U. Osu . It 's a Japanese word . It means " to push . " I say we run down those telephone numbers . Hey . I think you drooled on me . Sorry . What time is it ? It 's , uh ... 20 to 3 : 00 . No luck , I take it ? No , nothing here , nothing at the other two pay phones . I checked in with Burst ; he 's beginning to think it 's a wild goose chase . Hello ? Are you two just going to sit there all night ? Don 't bother hunting around for me ; I 'm far away . Okay on the trace . Although I was watching you up until about an hour ago . You and your pretty partner seem awfully close . Do you work well together ? Who is this ? What 's your name ? Sorry , G-man . It 's not that easy . You have to follow my little bread crumb trail , prove your worth . So far , you 're doing all right . Why do I have to prove my worth to you ? You think this is a game ? What , do you want to be found ? All right , where 's my next bread crumb ? Right in front of you . Let your fingers do the walking , G-man . Okay . Not a complete trace . They think he was using a digital scrambler . " Let your fingers do the walking . " Phone book . No , no . What if Pusher was the last person to use this phone ? Can you redial on these kind of phones ? Hang on a second . Murphy . Yeah , it 's me again . We want the last number dialed out from this location . Just ring it on through . Okay . Hi ! You 've reached Tee-Totallers ... golf driving range and pro shop . Our hours of operation are 7 : 00 a.m. to midnight Monday through Saturday , and 7 : 00 a.m. to 10 : 00 p.m. on Sundays . So he 's a killer and a golfer . Rings a bell , huh ? Let 's go , G-woman . Oh , yeah ! Strong shot . Good shot . Hoo-hoo ! All right , gentlemen , I 'm using this here non-sanctioned ball . It 's got a core of uranium ... or some damned thing , I don 't know what . Gets up there like Sputnik . Yeah ! About time . Konnichiwa , gentlemen . I was never here . Police ! - Get down ! Get down ! - Whoa ! Okay . Okay , okay , relax . Relax . Let me see your face . Take it easy . Come on . That 's right . That 's right . Hey , Collins . Listen . I need you to do something for me . Will you do something for me ? Mulder . Collins ? - God ... - What the hell ? Collins , what the hell are you doing ? Collins , let it go . Stop me ! Collins . Put that down . Light up , light up , light up , light up ... Come in ! This is Burst ! Get a burn unit over here ! Yeah , Collins is down . - Bad , yeah , real bad ! - Light up , light up ... I don 't know what happened ! Get over here ! Yeah , get somebody over here . Now ! Collins , it 's all right . It 's all right . Take it easy . Federal agent ! Light up , light , light , light up ... Oh . Bet you five bucks I get off . Rise and state your name and address for the court . Robert Patrick Modell . 3083 Roseneath Avenue , Apartment 9 , Alexandria , Virginia . Agent Mulder , does the FBI believe that this defendant is responsible for 14 murders ? That is correct , Your Honor . Well , in each of the cases , the coroner 's office ruled suicide . We believe that they were indeed murders , Your Honor . You believe ? But do you have any actual evidence ? We have the defendant on audio tape confessing to the murders . On several separate occasions , he clearly identifies them as such . Furthermore , the defendant knows crime scene details that were only available to the police . Your Honor , one of these so-called " murder victims " threw herself under a commuter train . This was a crowded platform , 100 witnesses . Nobody pushed her . No one was within 30 feet of her . But your client was present . Which is how he knew your crime scene details . Make your point , Agent Mulder . I believe that these people died because it was the defendant 's express will - that they do so . - His will ? This man admitted to being a killer for hire . I believe he has a unique suggestive ability which makes for the perfect M.O. He is able to talk his victims into injuring themselves . I can 't believe this . Do you want to run that by me one more time , Agent Mulder ? Yesterday , a federal law enforcement officer was induced to self-immolation by the defendant . I witnessed it . All these other officers witnessed it . Your Honor , we have Modell 's confession . All we 're ask ... Your Honor , the evidence chain for this case has been rather difficult to establish . We 're asking the court 's indulgence while we complete our investigation , and we 'd like to have Mr. Modell held for trial based on the strength of his taped confession . What about this audio tape , Mr. Modell ? Did you confess to 14 murders ? Keep it simple . No details . Unfortunately , yes , Your Honor . Not that I remember any of it . This was , uh , basically a drunken phone prank on the part of my client , Your Honor . A phone prank ? He had the details of every case , Your Honor . And Robert deeply regrets the distress and confusion this situation has caused . Do you deny these charges ? Absolutely , Your Honor . I 'm not guilty . Thank you very much . Will you excuse me for a minute ? I believe you owe me five dollars . Hey , your shoe 's untied . Made you look . How do you do it ? Hey , Modell . I know your name now . I know where you live ! I dug up a few more things on our Robert Patrick Modell . Let me guess : he was an average student , he attended an average community college , he did an average stint in the military . Which branch of service ? Not his first choice . He wanted to be a Navy Seal , then he wanted to be an Army Special Forces Green Beret . Promptly washed out of both , though not for lack of intelligence . He ended up being a supply clerk at Fort Bragg . Served two years , general discharge . Did you know that he applied to the FBI ? He didn 't even come close to passing the psych screening . You got a copy of that ? Yeah . They found him to be acutely ego-centered . He has no regard for the feelings of others , instead , perceiving people as objects . He 's extremely suspicious of governments and authority . Yet he wants to be in authority . The screener caught him in a dozen self-aggrandizing lies ... saying that he was a master of martial arts , that he had been trained by Gurkhas in Nepal and ninjas in Japan . Ninjas are said to have the ability to cloud the minds of their opponents . Are we talking kung fu movies , Mulder ? He certainly clouded the mind of that judge , Scully . Even if Modell could , he didn 't need to . We barely had a case against him . Oh , we had enough to get past a simple preliminary hearing . Modell psyched the guy out . He put the whammy on him . Please explain to me the scientific nature of the whammy . I don 't know , maybe-maybe it 's some mental aspect of some Eastern martial art , you know , the temporary suppression of the brain 's chemistry produced by a specific timbre or cadence in Modell 's voice . His voice seems to be the key . Mulder , Modell 's last known employment was as a convenience store clerk . He has never been trained by ninjas . He has never even been out of the U.S. He is just a little man who wishes that he were someone big , and we 're feeding that wish . That failed psych screening ... if Modell could actually control people 's minds , right now he 'd be an FBI agent , right ? He 'd be a Green Beret , a Navy Seal . Maybe the ability came to him more recently , like in the last two years . Well , o-okay . What 's your big theory ? How do you explain what Agent Collins did ? I mean , this is a sane man , a family man with no prior history of psychological problems ... sets himself on fire . You witnessed that . How does that happen ? What do you need me to say , Mulder , that I believe that Modell is guilty of murder ? I do . I 'm just looking for an explanation a little more mundane than " the whammy . " Well , he 's laughing at us , Scully . Excuse me . Where might I find the computer records section ? Fourth floor , west wing . Thank you very much . Can I help you ? I need to know some things Holly . Great . Just let me have the keyboard for a minute . I 'd love a print-out of this . And a cup of coffee when you get a chance . I wish I could get my hands on the guy that did that to you . I 'd make him pay . This is great , Holly . It 's perfect , just what I wanted . Can I help you ? No . No , thanks . We 're , uh ... we 're just fine . Look , we 're in the middle of something here , so ... Who are you and what are you doing here ? Take a walk , Mel Cooley . Let me go ! Let me go ! Shut up ! Holly , call security . Holly . He 's the one . He 's the one who mugged you . Holly , call security now ! Make him stop hurting me , Hol ... Shut up ! Holly , now ! Holly ? Holly ! Security . I 've got a situation in here , fourth floor ... Hurt him back . Sir , I 'm so terribly ... terribly sorry . I don 't know why I ... Oh , God . I 'm so sorry . All right , let 's hit the bricks , huh ? Holly , can you tell us anything more that might help us understand why you attacked Assistant Director Skinner ? It 's like suddenly I was watching myself from across the room ... doing these things . It 's like he was with me inside my head . Modell ? That 's the only way I know how to put it . Excuse me , sir ? Can we speak outside ? Yeah . Sure . Uh , Holly , excuse us for a minute , please . I reviewed the building security tapes . Modell can clearly be seen entering and leaving unnoticed . He had the word " pass " on his lapel . Guards that waved him by don 't even remember seeing him at all . And you 're saying this same mysterious phenomenon is the reason I have a size-seven heel mark on my face ? I 'd have to agree with Agent Mulder , sir . I can 't even begin to explain how , but I think that Modell is responsible for your injuries . Why 's this guy so interested in you ? What do you mean ? He left with one file ... yours . He didn 't access any others . Now he knows where you live . And you know where he lives . - Go pick him up . - Yeah , for what ? About the only thing we got on him now is criminal trespass . Well , that 's enough for a warrant . Police ! Get down ! Police ! Get down ! Police ! Get down ! Modell ! Lights coming on ! Look me right in the eye . Right in the eye . Svengali . All clear ... no one 's home . Search the whole building . And nearby buildings , too . We know that Modell likes to watch from a distance . Check the place out . I 'll talk to the neighbors . Hey , Scully , check this out . " Mango-kiwi tropical swirl . " Now we know we 're dealing with a madman . Is there anything else you can tell me ? Yeah . Yeah , when does it date to ? Right . Thank you very much . Tegretol . What 's that ? It 's to relieve Modell 's seizures . He has temporal-lobe epilepsy . I just talked to his doctor 's office . They wouldn 't give me much over the phone ... just that that prescription dates back to April 1994 . What causes epilepsy this late in life ? Uh , head injury , neurological disease , - a brain tumor or lesion ... - A tumor ? The growth of brain tumors has been linked with the reported occurrence of psychic ability . Mulder , those reports are completely unsubstantiated . Look , just bear with me for a second . What if Modell 's suggestive ability is really a form of psychokinesis ? Brought on by the brain tumor ? Well , it fits . All those protein drinks in his fridge ? Maybe he 's got to replenish the metabolic energy that he uses in the process of controlling somebody 's will . Mulder , more to the point , if Modell did have a brain tumor , the effects on his health would be more debilitating . It 's likely that he simply wouldn 't be well enough to play these cat and mouse games with us . Maybe he isn 't . Maybe that 's the whole point . - What do you mean ? - His exhaustion at the driving range . He didn 't let us capture him . He was too sick to escape , too tired , too wiped out . Why would a killer who is so proficient confess to murders that he 'd already gotten away with ? Maybe he 's dying . And wants to go out in a blaze of glory . Not with a whimper but a bang . Get the tracing gear . Hello ? Hey , hey , hey , what do you say ? What 's up , Modell ? How you doing ? Long time no see . Told you I know where you live . Nice apartment , Modell . Who does your decorating ? The Grinch that stole Christmas ? Agent Frank Burst , the guy with the great name . Say , Frank , are Agent Mulder and Scully there ? Yeah , we 're here . Perfect . Frank , how much do you weigh ? Excuse me ? About how much do you weigh ? Anything to keep you talking you piece of ... I don 't know , about 190 , 195 . Ha ! 215 if you 're a day . You 're totally the wrong weight for your height . I mean , no offense , Frank , but you 're built like a fireplug . Yeah , and I got stubby little legs gonna kick you right in the ass . You going somewhere with this , Modell ? Well , it 's just that it can 't be healthy . And you look like maybe you 're a smoker , you probably take a little drink now and then , eat greasy fried food ... sausage , bacon , eggs over easy . Frank ... Onion rings that soak those dark stains through the cardboard . And I 'm guessing you shake on that salt like a maraca . Frank ... Frank , hang up the phone . What are you talking about , Modell ? What 's your point ? Well , you know what that 's doing to your arteries . Terrible things , Frank . Terrible things . Frank ... Waxy yellow chunks of plaque are tumbling through your bloodstream , sticking like glue to your arterial walls ... Hang up the phone . Keep talking , you bastard . ... squeezing shut your aorta . Can you feel it , Frank ? Come on , man , hang up the phone . Can you feel your aorta ... - Frank , hang up the phone ! - Back off ! Frank , hang up the phone ! I said back off ! Hang it up ! Finish the trace ! Mulder ... Somebody hang up the phone ! There 's this medical condition called pachyemia . It 's when the blood thickens up in your veins like strawberry jam . Agent Scully . Finish the trace ! Frank , hang it up ! Hang up ! Your heart flatlines ... Frank ... And you die , Frank . Frank ? Yo , Frank ? No pulse . Get an ambulance . Yeah , we need an ambulance to 3083 Roseneath Avenue , Apartment 9 . Possible cardiac arrest . Roger that . Modell ? Hey , Mulder . How 's Frankie boy ? What is it , Modell , really , that you want ? A worthy adversary . It 's obviously not that fat lout lying at your feet . And I 'm hoping it 's you . Why me ? I 've read all about you . You 're a top criminal profiler . Oxford University grad , all-around bright young man . You know what makes guys like me tick , right ? You think you see right through old Bob Modell . Sick old Bob Modell , right ? You 're dying , aren 't you , Bob ? What ? Do you want to take a few innocent people with you before you go ? Biology tells us we 're all dying . And original sin tells me ain 't nobody innocent . Yeah , and some are more innocent than others . Now , why don 't you just tell me where you are . Oh , you want the phone number ? Sure . Just , uh ... It 's 555-0197 . You know , it 's just a pay phone . In two minutes , I 'll be gone . You mean you killed this man for nothing , you sick bastard ? Me ? No , haven 't you caught on , Mulder ? They all kill themselves . Where 's Modell calling from ? Gas station parking lot . 12,000 block Chain Bridge Road . It 's a pay phone , just like he said . Fairfax Mercy Hospital is right down the street from there , huh ? Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy . " Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy . " He must need regular treatment , Mulder . Well , let 's go find out . We found Modell 's car . Engine 's still warm ; he 's probably in the building . All entrances covered . Do we hold or go in ? Hold . Right . Thank you . Hold . Roger . The outpatient office says Modell is scheduled for a 2 : 30 MRI . That 's right now . How do you want to play this ? I think I should go in alone . - Why ? - My team can flush him out . What if Modell turns one of your men against the others ... in a crowded hospital ? I think we should give him what he wants . You . We stand a better chance if we 're separated . I 'll go on mic . That way , you 'll know what he 's doing , where he is at all times . You got a radio , something to keep my hands free ? Got just what you need . Two lux video camera . It 'll practically see in the dark . It 's designed for bomb disposal work , to keep only one officer at risk . See ? Think I get the Playboy Channel ? Smile , Scully . Take it . No . I wouldn 't want to end up pointing it at anybody except Modell . Let 's get this show on the road . Federal agent . Go about your business as usual . Scully , do you read me ? I 'm with you , Mulder . Nothing out of the ordinary . SWAT team , hold outside . SWAT team still holding . Mulder ! Two shots fired ! SWAT team ! No , not yet ! Everybody keep moving ! Federal agent ! Let me see ... Mulder , I 'm losing you . Damn . Mulder ! Agent Mulder ! Wait . Agent Scully . You getting this back there ? Mulder , what happened ? Looks like the guard shot the technician , then he shot himself . His gun is missing . Brophy , tell your men Modell may be heading your way . SWAT team , suspect is armed and is possibly making his way out of the building . We copy . We 're ready for him . Shooters in position . Mulder , wait , wait . Get close to the computer monitor . Over here ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Right there . There . That light mass in his temporal lobe . Right here . You were right , Mulder . Now check around you . Modell 's chart should be somewhere around there . We 're batting a thousand , Scully . Modell 's dying . He 's got nothing to lose . Mulder , just get out of there . Go . Mulder ? Mulder ! God ! We think they 're three doors down . We 've got both ends sewn up tight , but there are six critical care rooms we can 't get to . If we gas the halls , we might kill those patients . Why do we keep giving this guy exactly what he wants ? Just wait for a signal from me . You 're clear . Mulder . Thanks for joining us . We 've got a dozen law enforcement officers outside in the hall , another 30 in the parking lot . Regular convention . So whatever you 've got planned , it 's not going to work out the way you want it to . You don 't know what I got planned . Two warriors of equal skill fight to the death . One is a student of Japanese budo the way of war . Budo teaches the warrior to leave himself outside the battle . In other words to disregard his own death . Because of that , the budo warrior always wins . I am that warrior . I don 't fear my death . So I ... I 'm going to give you one pull of the trigger against me . One-in-six chance . One . One pull . Wait . Mulder , look . There 's pure oxygen in this room . There 's no telling what could happen if you pull that trigger . Piece of cake . Your turn . Mulder , no . Mulder , yes . Go . Mulder , listen to me . Give me the gun . We can stop this thing right now . You and I can just walk outside of this room ... No ! Damn you ! You bastard ! Mulder , hand me the gun ! Mulder , you don 't have to do this . You 're stronger than this . Your turn , Scully . Got to play by rules . Pull the trigger , Mulder . Mulder , fight him . You can fight this . Come on . Pull the trigger , Mulder . She shot you . I read it in her files . Payback time ... shoot the little spy ! I 'm going to kill you , Modell . Yeah , pull the trigger , you get another crack at me . Scully , run ! Scully ... Scully ... Federal agents ! Get down ! Get down ! Get down ! There 's no telling how long he 'll hang on , but he 'll never regain consciousness . You know , we thought he was undergoing treatment . We were wrong . What do you mean ? Read his chart . The MRis were a way to gauge how much life he had left , but he consistently refused treatment . The tumor remained operable right up until the end , but he refused to have it removed . Why ? I think it 's like you said . He was always such a ... little man . This was finally something that made him feel big . I say we don 't let him take up another minute of our time . I made this !

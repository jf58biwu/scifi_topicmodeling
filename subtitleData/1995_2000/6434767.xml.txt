 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman ? THEME SONG : Weird science ! Pictures from a magazine . Diagrams and charts . Mending broken hearts and making weird science ! Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces . My creation ! Is it real ? It 's my creation ! Ooh ! My creation ! It 's my creation ! No heart of gold , it 's flesh and blood ! I do not know . It 's my creation ! Ooh ! My creation ! It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive ! Alive ! GIRLS : Farber High School ! Yeah ! GIRLS : Farber High School ! Gary ? Hello ? Hold on ! You ever seen talent like that ? She almost never drops it . COACH : Good job , Alice ! She 's great , Gar . So you gonna go with me or not ? Sorry , Wyatt , I 'm not going with you to the retirement home to see your nana . I got plans of my own . GIRLS : Go , Farber ! Go , Farber ! Go , go , go ! [ WHISTLE BLOWING ] COACH : Great job , girls ! See you tomorrow ! Great double twisty flippy twirly thing . Thanks , Gar . I can 't believe you 're at practice again . It 's , like , so sweet ! That 's me- - sweet . Oh , Gary ! Did you hear about Rachel and Steve ? Uh , no , I didn 't . Oh my gosh ! They completely got into this huge fight . And Rachel told Steve that she was gonna go out with other people . And Steve totally freaked out . He was like , no way ! And Rachel 's like , nu-uh . And he goes , fine , then I am too . And she 's like , go ahead ! And he 's all , fine . And she goes , fine . And he was all , fine . And it 's so depressing . Uh , sorry ? That 's OK . So , you want to get together after school ? Maybe you can come over to my house . My parents aren 't home . What about nana ? Oh , boy , this is a toughie . See you at 3 : 00 . I 'd go with you , but this is date number three . And on the second date , she said she doesn 't make out till the third date . I made the cut ! [ VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS ] So what did you learn in school today ? I learned that friendship is no match for Carla Robinson 's thighs . What do you mean ? I have to visit my nana at the retirement home today . I wanted Gary to go with me , but he bailed . I don 't blame him . She 's my grandma and I don 't even wanna go . You don 't wanna go visit your nana ? It 's not her . It 's where she lives . The retirement home is so depressing . All those old people . I 'll go with you . You will ? Sure . I love old people . They 're interesting . Think about it , your grandma has lived through two world wars . She was born before there was televisions or computers . Don 't you think that makes her interesting ? I think it makes her old . You know , in some countries , old people are revered . So ? In some countries Jerry Lewis is revered . He cracks me up . ( IMITATING JERRY LEWIS ) Hello , lady ! Hi , nana . Look who it is . It 's my grandson , Wyatt . Isn 't he handsome ? And who is this ? Don 't tell me , my baby boy has a girlfriend . She 's just a friend . This is Lisa . Lisa , my grandma . Hello , nana . I hope we 're not breaking up the game . What could be more important than my grandson and his friend ? Besides , I 'm losing my shirt to these pirates . [ SIGHING ] So , grandma , what have you been up to ? What 's that , honey ? He asked what you 're up to . Oh , well , they keep you pretty busy around here . I do a little bit of everything . You know , I started square dancing every Wednesday . It sounds like you have a good time around here . Well , nobody 's gone over the wall yet . Of course , I 'd have a better time if I had more visits from my favorite grandson . I 'd come by more , but , you know , homework and chess club , school paper . You don 't have to snow job me , Wyatt . Oh , that reminds me . How 's Chett ? Still at reform school ? It was military school , nana . You say " tomato . " Anyway , he 's home now . I always said that boy was evil . Pure evil . But so handsome . He does ask for it sometimes . Once I turned him into a radish . Well , we better be going . So soon ? Yeah . We gotta be somewhere . Youth , always on the move . I wish I had the energy to keep up . Come see me again . I miss your visits . I miss you , too . Take care of yourself . And Lisa , you 're a lovely girl . Stop by any time . I will . Thanks , nana . Your grandma is really sweet , Wyatt . You should 've seen her when she was younger . She had so much energy . I just wish we had that Nana back . That 's all . Hey , could you do that , Lis ? Can you help her ? I could . But what do you think your grandma would have to say about it ? Are you kidding ? Who wouldn 't want to be young again ? I don 't know . It 's just not natural . You heard her . She said she wanted to be able to keep up . Couldn 't you at least give her the energy of a young person ? A little vitality ? One condition- - when the spell wears off , you visit her more often . Deal . Nana ! Coming , dear . Well , how do you feel ? I feel fine . Why do you keep asking me that ? Where are you taking me ? I thought we 'd spend the day together . Aw . I don 't think it worked . GUY : Heads up ! I got it ! Nana ! GUY : Whoa , good shot ! Come on , come back . Go long , skinny . Hey , what do you know ? I got my old arm back . Yeah ! Mom and dad are out of town , so no one will be asking any questions . Again ? Well , there 's a surprise . The TV does a better job of raising you than that son of mine . Nana ! What 'd she do , tunnel out ? How are you , today ? Up for a little football ? If you think you 're man enough . Ow . Nana , that hurt . Come on ! I thought you were a tough guy . All of a sudden , I 'm just feeling a little achy . That 's all . Later , ladies . Come on , Wyatt . If we don 't hit the road soon , I 'm gonna pop . Let 's go eat something big and greasy . It 's been a long time . Cholesterol be damned ! Hey , Wy . Lisa , this is Carla . Hi , Carla . Hi . And that 's Wyatt 's nana . It 's so nice to meet you . Oh ! Oh , my back ! Oh , Gary , would you be a dear and help me with my chair ? Hey , Wy , got any chapstick ? Hey , Wy , why are you dragging nana around ? Isn 't she a little old for fun ? I 'm not too old to kick your scrawny butt . Nana , you got a new hearing aid . That 's- - why don 't we order ? Uh , Carla , order anything you want . Why are you whispering ? I said , order anything you want . That 's OK . I went before I left the house . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Who wants to dance ? Come on ! What 's with her ? I don 't know . The Geritol must be kicking in . What do you want , Carla ? Oh , you go ahead . I like to wait until 5 : 00 when the early bird special kicks in . Um , I 'll have some fries and a Coke . Carla , what are you doing ? If you wanted some sugar , all you had to do was ask . Oh , look at the two of us acting like a couple of crazy kids . You ever get fresh like that again , and I 'll show you what for . Wee , you 're a regular spitfire ! What 's with the George Burns routine ? Huh ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ] The problem with movies today is all that filthy language . It 's F this and S that and GD the other thing . And don 't get me started on the nudity . What the H am I talking about ? Lisa , what 's happening to him ? And Carla ? Don 't panic . I believe there might be a slim chance that touching grandma could be hazardous to your health . - What ? - What ? Apparently your wish has a side effect . What wish ? Wyatt asked for Nana to feel young again . Oh ! Well , ain 't that sweet ? Except it seems like every time she touches someone , she steals their youth . That 's what happened to Carla and Gary . She 's right . I do feel old . But I never touched Nana . Honest ! But Carla did . It 's like a virus spreading around zapping people 's energy . Well , congratulations . You just made Letterman 's top 10 list of all-time crappy wishes ! She didn 't say anything about starting a plague ! I didn 't know ! Well , fix it ! You can fix it , can 't you ? Sure . You just walk grandma back through the doors of the home , then everything will go back to normal . Round up that cute little grandma of yours . We 're going to the home ! Come on , mother . Let 's party ! Look at her , she 's young again . I can 't take it away so soon . She took it from me ! Just give it a couple more days , Gary . Please . What can it hurt ? Normally I 'd fight you on this one , but it 's almost time for " Murder She Wrote . " That Jessica Fletcher really pumps my pistons . But you owe me one . What do you want ? Spring for one of those all-you-can-eat smorgasbords ? Smorgasbord ? Smorgasbord it is . I think I got a coupon . OK , Paco , as I 'm feeling a little draggy today , I 'm gonna need you to keep your blocking real tight . If I block too tight , I could break a hip . Rick , you take the handoff . Something 's firing up my corns . Well , what about Bull ? [ SNORING ] I could go for a nice bowl of soup . Soup goes right through me . OK , guys , listen up . We 're gonna do the shuffle pass . How about a little shuffleboard ? Shuffleboard goes right through me . Maybe I better lie down . OK , ready ? One , two , three , break . I can 't believe how much you tipped that girl . What are you , made of money ? She brought me a nice lean piece of meat . Cut it for me , too . What are we watching anyways ? It 's so fast , fast , fast ! MAN ( ON TV ) : Is your husband watching ? MAN ( ON TV ) : Well , that 'll be third down . [ SNORING ] Well , that 's enough TV . OK , what 's next ? You haven 't taken a break since we left the home . Aren 't you tired yet ? Tired ? I 'm wired ! I got more energy than I know what to do with . You still up for a little action ? If that 's what you want . Good , cause I can 't sit still . Go , go , go to Cocomo ! Are you having fun , Grandma ? Fun ? I don 't know . I feel sort of restless , like if we don 't get out there , I 'm gonna miss something . I don 't know what 's happening to me . Well , I know Wyatt 's sure glad to see you so peppy . Oh , Wyatt 's a good boy . A lightweight , but a good boy . Let 's hit it ! [ SNORING ] Woo ! All right ! Yeah ! [ INAUDIBLE ] . I 'll tell you what 's sadder . The sight of all those young , cute girls in tights isn 't exactly twisting my lug nuts . We gotta do something , Wy . And look at poor Carla . If she moves any slower , she 's going to stop . Gary , you 're right . What did I say ? You know what comes after extreme old age ? Nothing . You 're young . You 're old . Ah ! I 'm too young to die of old age . Don 't have a stroke , we 'll figure it out . How ? Don 't have a stroke , we 'll figure it out . Oh , great . I 'm counting on you to save my life , and you 're senile . [ THUD ] - We 're too late ! - Carla ! - What happened ? - She 's dead ! GIRL : Did she faint ? Nana killed what 's-her-name . GIRL : It 's Carla . She fell down . GIRL : We should call a nurse or something . Carla , my beautiful Carla . Gary , wait ! Listen . [ SNORING ] Guys , what 's going on ? What 'd she say ? Uh-oh . Yeah , uh-oh . This thing has gone on way too far . And- - and it 's getting worse every minute . Grandpira must be stopped . And preferably before we 're worm food . OK ! Don 't get so crotchety ! You were the one who wanted to fool with mother nature . Huh ? Hey- - hey , where 's Nana ? We have to get her back . I don 't know where she is . I came here to see if she was with you . We 'd better find her . We have to hurry . Maybe it will be faster if we split up . Catch you later . What 'd she say ? Who ? Way to go , beef for brains . You think you can do better ? My grandma could do better . Chett , can you give us a ride ? We have to find Nana . Your legs broke ? You 're young . You should walk . When I was your age- - Please , Chett . It 's a matter of life and death . You only hear from ' em when they want something from you . OK , fine . You pay for gas . But let 's hurry up . I don 't wanna drive at night . Thanks , you old fart . What happened to your jeep ? Traded it in for this beauty . They don 't make ' em like this anymore . MAN : Come on , man ! Get off the road ! [ HONKING ] I don 't want to alarm you , but I don 't think I have a pulse . I don 't see her , Gar . She 's not in here . Oh , wait , there she is ! One , two , three- - slow but steady . We gotta think like a young person . If I was young again , I 'd take better care of my ticker , work out . Exercise . That 's it . We gotta go to the gym ! It 's too late for that . Not for you , you old fool . Nana ! We 've been looking everywhere for you . Yeah . Where ya been ? I 'm sorry I worried you boys . I 've been here for hours trying to burn off some of this energy . Nana , I know you 're having fun , but you have to come with me . It 's really important , OK ? OK , Wyatt . Where are we going ? I 'm taking you back to the retirement home . Sure , honey , whatever you say . I 'll race ya ! Last one there is a rotten egg ! Get her ! You found her . No thanks to you , Lois . Lisa . Where have you been anyway ? I looked everywhere for her- - Saint-Tropez , Rio , Disneyland . You never know . Well , Grandma , this is it . I hate that I have to send her back here . I know , Wyatt , but you have to hurry up . I 'm worried about Gary . Chocolate , cutie ? Eh ! Home at last , Nana . Whose turn is it ? I forgot . Figures you would , you wuss . Who you calling a wuss ? You guys stand back . But we 're losing her . Clear ! Stop ! Is this , like , a joke or something ? Get those freakin ' things away from me ! Sorry . God ! You feel OK , Nana ? Oh , you know , same old aches and pains . I don 't know what happened out there , but I didn 't like it . You didn 't ? No way . I felt like a teenager again . What 's wrong with that ? All that energy ? Too much energy . It wasn 't me . Being 16 tired me out the first time . Damned if I 'm going through all that again . You mean , you like being in this place ? Well , yeah . I 've earned a little RR , and I 'm enjoying it . There 's no rent , no work , no food shopping . And just between us , teaching Mr. Jeffries to tango makes for a pretty hot Sunday afternoon . And you don 't mind being old ? There 's an old Chinese blessing that says , may you live in interesting times . I have lived in very interesting times , Wyatt , and I wouldn 't trade ' em for anything . Old age isn 't something to be afraid of . I 'm not afraid . Good . Then you can come and see me more often . And bring your friend Lisa . She 's fun . But tell her to leave her magic at home . Don 't need it . Oh , Sadie , it 's so good to see you ! [ INAUDIBLE ] This is ridiculous . There 's nothing but old folks on TV- - " Golden Girls , " " Matlock , " " Murder She Wrote , " " 90210 . " I can 't get away from ' em . Haven 't you learned anything over the last two days ? Some day you 're gonna be old , too , you know . You could be a little more tolerant . Or I could be young forever . Lis , if you don 't mind , make it so I never get old . With pleasure . He 's not gonna learn anything from that either , you know . Yeah , but at least we can finish watching " Murder She Wrote " in peace . MAN ( ON TV ) : You have an incredible memory , Mrs. Fletcher . WOMAN ( ON TV ) : Oh , please . THEME SONG : Weird science ! Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip . Something different we 're making . Weird science ! Ooh ! Pictures from a magazine . Bits and pieces and bits and pieces and- - my creation , is it real ? It 's my creation ! I do not know . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand my intentions ?

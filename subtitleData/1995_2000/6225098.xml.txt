 Sick Bay to the Captain . This is the Doctor speaking . You 've brought us out of stasis . I assume you have news . Yes . Our sensors show your vital signs are normal . How are you feeling ? We 're fine . How long were we in stasis ? A total of 17 days . That long ? I wanted to exhaust every possibility of finding a cure . And ? I regret to inform you that I have been unsuccessful . I have not been able to develop a counteragent for the virus , and I have no other options to explore . What about keeping us in stasis aboard Voyager ? . Something in the planet 's environment is shielding you from the effects of the virus . If you leave , you risk a recurrence of the disease , which would undoubtedly prove fatal . The only option I can think of at the moment is contacting the Vidiians . They have sophisticated medical technology . It 's possible they might be able to help . We 'll take it under advisement , Doctor . Thank you for your efforts . Janeway out . What do you think ? It 's risky . The Vidiians have never shown any willingness to help us . It 's more likely they 'd attack Voyager and try to harvest body parts from the crew . Agreed . I just want to make sure we 're not overlooking a possible alternative . Could we live with ourselves , knowing we 'd sent Voyager into that kind of danger ? Janeway to Tuvok . I 'm here , Captain . You must be aware of the Doctor 's report . Yes . I 'm turning over command of the ship to you on a permanent basis . Your orders are to resume a course for the Alpha Quadrant . And regardless of the Doctor 's suggestion , you are not to make contact with the Vidiians . I understand . I 'll prepare a message for the crew . So we 're just going to abandon them on this planet ? Those were Captain Janeway 's express orders . But you 're Captain now . You can rescind them . To what end ? I can 't believe we haven 't been able to find a cure for an insect bite . The Doctor hasn 't deactivated himself for a month . He 's tried everything . He 's searched every database , attempted the most drastic research . You can 't fault him . I can tell you the morale of the crew is going to suffer if we leave them behind . Not if , Mr. Neelix . When we leave them behind . The decision has been made . We will , of course , provide them with everything they 'll need for their survival and comfort . I am arranging for a modular shelter to be transported to the surface . They 'll have all the technology they need - weapons , tricorders , a replicator . You talk as though it were a camping trip . They have to spend the rest of their lives down there . That is not a certainty . Captain Janeway intends to continue researching the virus . She is an able scientist , and may eventually be able to effect a cure . They have a type-9 shuttlecraft at their disposal , if it becomes possible for them to leave the planet . A type-9 shuttlecraft has a top speed of warp 4 . It won 't take them more than ... oh , about 700 years to get home . I am not certain what it is you expect me to do , Lieutenant . I guess , clearly , something you can 't do , which is to feel as rotten about this as we do . You are correct that I am unable to experience that emotion . And frankly , I fail to see what the benefit would be . If there is nothing more , you are all dismissed . Janeway to Tuvok . Yes , Captain ? We 've received the transport . We 'll check it over and let you know if we 're missing anything . I will remain in orbit until I hear from you . And , after that , we can still remain in communication for approximately 36 hours . I 'll contact you before the day is over . Janeway out . It looks like they transported the contents of the whole ship . We may have to be here for a while . Petri dishes , protein analyzer , DNA sequencers . Everything I need for my research is here . Do you really think you can find a cure ? It may take a while , but , yes , I do . If I can find a specimen of the insect that infected us , I can begin analyzing protein cofactors . That might give us the information we need to find out what it is in this environment that 's keeping us from being sick and how to replicate it . Does it matter which way these things go ? I guess it depends whether you 're in a beige mood or a gray mood . That 's not much of a choice . Couldn 't Starfleet have come up with something a little more cheerful ? Like polka dots ? I was thinking more of a tasteful pinstripe , something in blues and greens . Well , I suggest we put the gray on the outside and the beige inside . I like that . I 've always looked better in beige . Actually , it might be kind of interesting , roughing it for a while . " Roughing it " ? Let 's see . We have shelter , furniture , research equipment , tricorders , a replicator . It 's too rough for me . We don 't have a bathtub . A bathtub ? I love a bath . It 's my favorite way of relaxing . Captain , I 'm sure you can learn to love the sonic shower . You know , Chakotay , it occurs to me , we aren 't exactly in a command structure anymore . Maybe you should call me Kathryn . Give me a few days on that one , okay ? This diagnostic report looks like it was written by a first-year Academy cadet . There are mistakes . It 's incomplete . I 'm sorry , Lieutenant . I guess I 've been distracted . We 've all been distracted , Ensign . That 's no excuse . Yes , ma 'am . I can 't get anything done here . Nobody can concentrate . I know how they feel . I 'm not feeling so terrific myself , but I don 't let that get in the way of my work . B 'Elanna ... I 've been talking with some of the Starfleet crew . They 're not happy about what happened . I was wondering ... how are the Maquis taking it ? How do you think they 're taking it ? This isn 't a Starfleet issue , Harry . It 's affecting everyone . Then why don 't we do something about it ? Do what ? I don 't know . It seems like we shouldn 't just accept this . Well , that 's all well and good , but , frankly , I can 't think of anything else we can do . If you have any ideas , I 'll listen . Otherwise , I think we should take a deep breath and move on . Catch anything ? Just the same ones as yesterday , and they don 't seem to carry the pathogen that 's infected us . Where have you been ? Oh , in the woods . For the past two days , you 've been spending a lot of time in the woods . is something going on I should know about ? Uh , not yet . Not yet ? What 's that supposed to mean ? It means , when it 's time for you to know , I 'll tell you . Don 't I even get hints ? I 'm building something . Building ? What could you be building ? And why can 't you tell me ? You can 't stand it , can you ? You 're like a little kid , wheedling . Tuvok to Janeway . Janeway here . We 're about to move out of communications range . How are you faring ? We 're doing quite well . I 'd like to speak to the crew now . Your com link has been put through to the entire ship . This is Kathryn Janeway . I 've never liked saying good-bye , so I 'll make this brief . But I want you all to know that serving as your Captain has been the most extraordinary experience of my life . No Captain could ask more than what this crew has given - bravery , compassion and strength of character . But I think what I 'll miss most is the fun . The times we joked together , the games on the holodeck . I 'll remember the laughter more than anything . Although Commander Chakotay and I won 't be with you for the rest of your journey , we know that you 'll be the same steadfast crew for Mr. Tuvok as you have been for us . We wish you a safe and a speedy journey home . Our thoughts will be with you . Janeway out . Thank you , Captain , Commander . I am sure I speak for the entire crew when I say we will always remember your grace and courage . And I would like to add , it has been an honor serving with you . Live long and prosper . Kathryn Janeway 's Personal Log , Stardate 49690.1 . Day 24 of our stay on the planet we 've named New Earth . As yet , I 've been unable to make any progress in finding a cure for our illness , but a soak in the tub Chakotay built always helps me focus on possible solutions . Chakotay , are you there ? No , I left an hour ago . I was thinking . Maybe looking for protein cofactors is the wrong approach . Even if I can 't find a specimen of the insect that infected us ... I could try to learn something about the biomolecular evolution of this planet 's ecosystem . Can 't hurt to give it a try . Chakotay ! What ? Someone 's in the woods . Over there . It looks like some kind of primate . I 've detected primate life-signs here , but I 've never seen one . Hello . Are you hungry ? is that why you came here ? I 'm Kathryn . He 's Chakotay . We 've had to move into your neighborhood , but I hope we can be friends . Oh . Maybe he 'll come back . Looking for a pet ? No . Looking for a clue about primate physiology on this planet . They must have to contend with insect bites , too . Well ... excuse me . Maybe we should be out looking for other primates . I might be missing something important . Kathryn ... the Doctor worked for weeks trying to find a treatment for this disease . Yes . You 've been at it 12 hours a day , seven days a week since we got here , and we 're still no closer to a cure than we were the day we were infected . I 'm not sure what you 're getting at . My people have a saying . " Even the eagle must know when to sleep . " Maybe it 's time we both considered that . You mean quit . Give up . Why do you have to see it as defeat ? Maybe it 's simply ... accepting what life has dealt us , finding the good in it . There may be a day when I 'll come to that , Chakotay , but ... I 'm a long way from it right now . I need to keep looking . Acting Captain 's Log , supplemental . After six weeks , the decision to leave Captain Janeway and the First Officer behind still seems to weigh heavily on the crew . Captain Tuvok ? Yes , Ensign ? I 'm picking up a convoy on long-range sensors . It 's Vidiian , sir . Distance ? Approximately 1.5 light-years . Lieutenant , alter course to a different heading . I don 't want to risk their detecting us . Sir , the Vidiians ... Yes ? They 're within hailing range . We could ask them if they know anything about the Captain 's illness . You 're aware that Captain Janeway specifically told us not to risk contacting the Vidiians ? Yes , but it 's not like we went out of our way to find them . We would just be taking advantage of an opportunity that 's presented itself . That bit of sophistry is not terribly persuasive , Ensign . Sir , how can we turn our backs on this chance to do something ? Don 't we have to try ? Don 't we owe that to the Captain and the Commander ? The matter is closed , Ensign . Return to your station . What 's wrong with the rest of you ? You know I 'm right . Ensign Kim . We have a chance to help them . How can we ignore that ? Ensign , you are relieved of duty . Leave the Bridge at once , or I will have you put in the brig . Harry ... Proceed on the altered course , Lieutenant . Excuse me , Ensign Kim . Could we ? Sure . Have a seat . We just wanted you to know , we heard what happened on the Bridge . And we think you 're absolutely right . We 've got to contact the Vidiians . It 's a risk , but it 's worth it . That 's what I think , but Captain Tuvok 's made his decision . Two Ensigns and a crewman won 't change his mind . There are a lot more who agree with us . A lot . Really ? Everyone we talk to can 't believe that Tuvok won 't give this a try . Come on . Did you hear what happened this morning ? Sure did . Three weeks ago , you said if I had an idea about what to do , you 'd listen . I 'm listening . is there something going on that I should know about ? Have a seat , Neelix . We might have come up with the biggest morale booster you could possibly imagine . Come in . Could I have a moment , sir ? It 's 0100 hours , Ensign . Don 't you have the early shift this morning ? Yes , sir , but this is important . Very well . First of all , I want to apologize for my behavior yesterday . Apology accepted . I understand that this is a difficult situation for you . I 'd like to suggest a plan . It 's something a lot of people have helped to develop . We have two big bargaining points when it comes to dealing with the Vidiians . First , there 's the woman Doc treated - Danara Pel . They were very close , so I 'm sure she 'd help us if she could ; and then there 's B 'Elanna . Her DNA might lead to a cure for the phage . We could offer them some - in exchange for their help with a cure for the Captain and Chakotay . Those are , as you say , points in our favor , but there is also the fact that we were recently responsible for the destruction of a Vidiian ship , an act which killed over 300 of their people . That alone makes it unwise for us to contact them . Sir ... I think you should know how many people on this ship disagree with you . Everyone I talked to thinks we should give this a try . The people you talked to do not have the responsibility of commanding this vessel . I do . The safety of this crew is paramount , and I must do whatever I can to ensure that safety . But if we 're willing to take that risk in order to help the Captain ... Ensign , I 'm going to say this once and once only . If you ever question my orders again , you will be relieved of duty permanently . The next words I expect to hear from you are , " yes , sir . " Yes ... sir . I 'm going to check the insect traps in beta-4 . Oh , what are you up to now ? Making headboards . Headboards ? I 've noticed you sometimes sit up in your bed to read . Figured you might as well have a comfortable backrest . That 's very thoughtful of you , Chakotay . You 've done so many things to make our lives easier here . The cooking , for example . I hate to cook . But what I do makes you uncomfortable , doesn 't it ? Every time I do something that adds a personal touch to the shelter , you resist it . Sometimes it feels ... as though you 've given up . That you 're focused on making a home here instead of finding a cure that will let us leave . I can 't sacrifice the present waiting for a future that may never happen . The reality of this situation is that we may never leave here . So , yes , I 'm trying to make a home - something that 's more than a plain gray box . Someday I may have to let go . But not today , okay ? I tried a new glucose bait in the traps . I have a feeling this might be the day I make a breakthrough . Hello ? Chakotay ? Hello again . Well , you certainly cover a lot of territory . Or are you following me ? Do you understand me ? There . Know what that is ? That little insect just might be what gets me out of your backyard . What do you think of that , huh ? What is it ? What 's happened to the sky ? If you 're suggesting I should get out of here , I agree . Oh ! Oh ! Kathryn ! Kathryn . Are you hurt ? No. I couldn 't keep my balance and carry the case . Give it to me . What 's happening ? It seems to be some kind of plasma storm . Our tricorders don 't recognize it , but it sure packs a wallop . Come in . Do you have a moment ? Of course . Please sit down . I 'd like to talk to you ... about my father . Your father ? He was a very wise man . More than anyone , he shaped the person I am . If it hadn 't been for him , I would have never questioned my people 's beliefs . I would have never left our city . I would never have met all of you . Then we owe him a debt . It is difficult to imagine this journey without you . When he died , I had just turned one year old . I didn 't know how I 'd get through the rest of my life without him , but then I started working with you and I didn 't miss him so much anymore . I am honored by the comparison . As Captain , the well-being of your crew is important to you . Of course . Their emotional well-being as well as their physical safety ? I cannot allow myself to become hostage to their feelings . Tuvok , they are suffering because of this . Maybe you don 't know what it 's like . If you are suggesting that I am not sensitive to the situation , nothing could be further from the truth . I have lost a valued friend . I am not immune to the effects of that loss . Then try to imagine what it 's like for those of us who feel things deeply . A lot of the crew are on the Bridge , hoping you 'll talk to them . None of you can appreciate what it means to be in command of a ship until that responsibility rests squarely on your shoulders as it does on mine . It has been suggested that I take an action , which would require me to disobey an order , and knowingly put this crew into a life-threatening situation . In general , I believe it demonstrates faulty leadership to be guided by the emotions of a distraught crew . However , as Captain , I must not ignore the sensibilities of those I command . We will contact the Vidiians . This is my decision and mine alone . You are all absolved of responsibility in the matter . I will accept any consequences which may ensue . Lieutenant , set a course for the Vidiian convoy . Mr. Kim , let me know when we 're within hailing range . Oh ! Oh , no ! Let 's check outside . Maybe some of the insect traps are still intact . None of this is salvageable either . There 's no way I can continue to do my research . I 'm sorry . Well , that 's one way of letting go . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49694.2 . We have contacted the Vidiian convoy with encouraging results . They have promised to communicate with Dr. Danara Pel and ask if she will help us . Sir , the Vidiians are hailing us . On screen . Hello , Lieutenant . Doctor Pel , I didn 't expect to see you this quickly . When I heard what happened , I boarded the first ship I could . Tell me about this illness . They were infected by a virus after being bitten by insects on a planet approximately 70 light-years from here in a system with a yellow dwarf star . The third planet in a system of seven ? Yes . I know it well . There 's a particular kind of burrowing insect that carries the disease . Years ago , we developed an antiviral agent to combat it . Can we get some from you ? Of course . Our Captain said we could rendezvous with you . He 's transmitted the coordinates . I have them , sir . Thank you , Doctor . We appreciate your help . I 'm glad I can be of assistance . Estimated time to the coordinates ? Approximately 20 hours . Until then , I want a series of battle drills . We must be ready for whatever comes . I 've been thinking ... there 's plenty of wood available here . I could probably add rooms to the shelter . Give us a little more living space . How would you mill it ? I could do a certain amount with a phaser , but I was actually thinking of logs . As in log cabin ? I built a few of them when I was growing up . My father thought it was important that I learn how . When I was young , my parents took us on backpacking trips . They thought we should all keep a connection to our pioneer roots . I hated it - no bed , no replicator ... - No bathtub . - No bathtub . I guess I was always a child of the 24th century . Well ... maybe those camping trips helped prepare you for life here . Oh , no . Life here is much better than that . I think that 's the first time I 've heard you say anything positive about being here . Well , hello there . I haven 't seen you in a while . Where have you been ? Do you expect him to answer you ? Not really . I just sense intelligence in him , and I could swear he came to warn me about the plasma storm . Come here , fella . Come on . I doubt that he can be domesticated - at least not very easily . Well , we have plenty of time . The rest of our lives . That 's a long time . At least I hope so . Well , I can 't give you orders anymore , but I suggest we get back to work . Aye , aye , Captain . I guess I 'm not used to that kind of work . My knots are getting knots . Here , let me help . Oh , that feels good . I 've had a lot of practice at this . My mother used to get sore necks all the time . I was the only one she 'd trust not to make it worse . That 's much better . Thank you . Well ... I 'm going to go to bed now . I 'll see you in the morning . Sleep well , Kathryn . Yes . You , too . Got something . Vidiian ship , bearing 325 mark 5 . Hail them . They aren 't responding . Trying on alternating frequencies . I 'm reading a second ship , 177 mark 5 . I 've got it . Now a third . They 're surrounding us . None of them are answering hails and their weapons are powered . Red Alert . We have to talk about this . All right . I think we need to define some parameters ... about us . I 'm not sure I can ... define parameters . But I can tell you a story - an ancient legend among my people . It 's about an angry warrior who lived his life in conflict with the rest of his tribe - a man who couldn 't find peace , even with the help of his spirit guide . For years , he struggled with his discontent . But the only satisfaction he ever got came when he was in battle . This made him a hero among his tribe , but the warrior still longed for peace within himself . One day , he and his war party were captured by a neighboring tribe led by a woman warrior . She called on him to join her because her tribe was too small and weak to defend itself from all its enemies . The woman warrior was brave and beautiful and very wise . The angry warrior swore to himself ... that he would stay by her side , doing whatever he could to make her burden lighter . From that point on , her needs would come first . And in that way ... the warrior began to know ... the true meaning of peace . is that really ... an ancient legend ? No . But that made it easier to say . Shields down to 58 percent . Rearm the forward phaser array and fire at will . Firing . Shields down to 47 percent . Sir , there are just too many of them . Load aft torpedo bays . Torpedoes armed . Fire number one . Report . They 're still coming . Fire number two . Tuvok to Engineering . Torres here , sir . Listen carefully . She has a broken arm . Set it with the osteogenic stimulator . I think there 's someone on the monitor . This way . Odd . Why wouldn 't they just use the com line ? I don 't think this is coming from our ship . Shmullus ... Shmullus , can you hear me ? Danara . Shmullus , I have to do this quickly . I 'm on one of the Vidiian ships . Do they know you 're contacting me ? Are you in any danger ? No . Everyone 's too focused on the battle . Oh , Shmullus , I swear I didn 't know they planned to attack . I thought we were on an errand of mercy . I believe you . I have the antiviral serum here . If you could use your transporter to get it to your ... Our shields are up . We can 't transport anything through them . I don 't know what else to suggest . All right . I 'll see what I can do . Maybe we can lower the shields long enough to transport the serum . Sick Bay to Bridge . This is Tuvok . We 're rather busy here , Doctor . Doctor Pel is on one of the Vidiian ships . If we can drop our shields briefly , we can beam aboard the serum . Keep this com line open , Doctor . When you hear me order the shields down , you must complete a site-to-site transport yourself . We will be busy with the Vidiians . Understood . Bridge to Engineering . Report . We 're ready to eject the antimatter container . Stand by for my command . Here is the sequence of events . We will drop shields to transport the medicine . At the same moment , the antimatter container will be ejected . As soon as it 's clear , Mr. Kim will detonate it with a photon torpedo . Simultaneously , Mr. Paris will jump to full impulse , so that we will not take the brunt of the explosion . is everyone clear on this ? Timing is of the utmost importance . We won 't get a second chance . Understood . Aye , sir . We 're ready down here . Doctor ? I 've set up to make the transport . Stand ready , then . Lower shields . lnitiating transport . Ejecting the antimatter container ... now . We 've got it . Raise shields . Mr. Kim , Mr. Paris ? Go . Firing torpedo . Report . The Vidiian ships are all disabled , sir . They 're not pursuing . Ready to go to warp , sir . Set a course for the planet where we left the Captain and Commander Chakotay . Warp 6 . Aye , aye , sir . How are they coming ? Very nicely . We should have vine-ripened Talaxian tomatoes in a couple of months ... unless this planet has the equivalent of tomato bugs . Oh , they 're awful . I would never have thought of you as a gardener . Hmm. I grew up around farmers . My parents insisted we learn some basic gardening skills . Did you hate that as much as camping ? Of course . Who wanted to muck around in the dirt when you could be studying quantum mechanics ? But ... I find it very satisfying now , watching the seeds sprout and grow . If your tomatoes could spare you for a minute , I 'd like your opinion on something in the house . You 've come to the right person . I always have an opinion . Really ? What do you think ? A boat . You said you wanted to explore the river ? I think I could build this . We could go on a camping trip . I 'm not sure we could fit the bathtub in the boat . Well , that 's all right . I 'll have the river . Do you hear that ? Yes . ... to Captain Janeway . Do you read me ? This is Tuvok calling Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay . Please respond . This is Janeway . Captain , it 's good to hear your voice . We have news . What is it ? We have medicine which we believe will effectively treat your condition . We plan to be in orbit within 30 hours . Ready ? There you are . At least I get to say good-bye . Feel free to use the house . Janeway to Voyager . Two to beam up . Welcome back , Captain . Commander . The Doctor tells me you contacted the Vidiians after all . I disobeyed your order , Captain . I am prepared to accept the consequences . If I didn 't know you better , I 'd say your decision was almost ... emotional . Thank you all . Well , we 've lost time with all this . Let 's see if we can make some of it up . Mr. Paris , warp 8 . Aye , Captain . Commander , we 'll need to review the ship 's systems . I 'll handle propulsion , environmental and communication . You 'll be responsible for sensors , weapons and transporters . Aye , Captain . I 'll have a report to you by 1800 hours . Check with phaser maintenance . See if they solved that problem with the prefire chamber temperature . Yes , ma 'am . I 'll see to it .

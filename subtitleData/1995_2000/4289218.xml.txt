 [ Video Games Beeping ] ~ ~ [ Video Game : Rock ] ~ ~ [ Continues ] Uh , hey . I , uh- - Yeah , I was playing that . Yeah , I just went to go take a whiz , and now I 'm back . - [ Female Voice ] Even good guys blow it . - [ Boy ] Damn ! You got a problem ? Um-Um- - It 's my game . I was playing here . Were ya , pinhead ? Now you 're not . No . [ Chuckles ] Maybe you didn 't hear me right . - I , uh , I said it was my game . - It 's his game . Man , I 'd step aside if I were you . All right . You guys wanna play a game ? We 'll play a game . I go first . [ Grunts ] [ Machines Power Down ] Oh , man . You shouldn 't have done that . Why ? What 's he gonna do ? ~ ~ [ Continues ] So is it my turn now ? - I 'm not wasting my time . - ~ Ring ~ ~ Ring the bell ~ ~ Wake the town ~ ~ Everyone 's asleep ~ ~ ~ [ Continues , Distant ] * * [ Continues , Louder ] ~ Got to keep aware to what 's happening ~ * I can see you bend in my condition * ~ I no longer feel ~ ~ My God is watching over me ~ ~ When you let me die ~ ~ My spirit 's free ~ ~ There 's nothing changing me ~ ~ ~ [ Vocalizing ] I feel a new record coming on , man . Both eardrums are ruptured . [ Sighs ] Cataracts over both eyes . - Probably heat-induced . - Probably ? Looks like his heart was cooked right in his chest . I have to admit , I 've never seen that kind of localized tissue damage . Well , there is extensive charring along the sternum ... with concomitant rib fractures , consistent with electrocution or exposure ... to high-voltage direct current , but I see no point of contact . The best I can figure is the lightning struck the car , killed the kid on contact . Did you find contact wounds on any of the five other victims ? I 'll have to look at my notes . I mean , it 's pretty clear to me what killed these kids . - Lightning ? - Well , yeah . Are you aware that something like 60 people die from lightning strikes ... across the country each year ? And five of those happened right here in Connerville . I know it 's statistically improbable , but- - There are only four deaths . It 's okay , Stan . You don 't have to defend your work . - Give us a minute , will you , please ? - Yeah , sure . I 'll be in my office . My name 's Teller . I 'm with the Johnston County Sheriffs Department . I just got word there was an F.B.I. investigation . - Yes . I 'm Agent Scully . - I know who you are . I just wonder what the hell you 're doing here . These deaths match other cases of multiple fatalities ... attributed to lightning , with the same inconclusive forensic evidence . Do you , uh , know anything about lightning , Agent Scully ? Yes , I know a little . Did you know that lightning kills several people a year ... at home in the shower or on the phone ? That people have seen it dancing on the ground like balls ? The scientists will tell you , push come to shove , they really don 't know what makes lightning work at all . - No , I didn 't know that . - Well , I know that , because I have breakfast with those scientists every morning down at the local diner . - I don 't understand . - That 's as clear as glass . Do you know what we manufacture here in Connerville ? What one of our little local commodities is ? We make lightning . Down at the Astadourian Lightning Observatory out on Route Four . One hundred ionized rods pointing up into the sky , designed to stimulate lightning . - I didn 't know that either . - That 's because you didn 't do your homework , did you ? You came here to do work that 's already been done . With all due respect , sir , these autopsies don 't quite add up . - Based on what ? - Based on my opinion as a medical doctor . Then based on your medical opinion , if you had to give one , what do you think this boy died of ? Well , since there is no other explanation , right now I 'd have to concur with the coroner- - that lightning is the most probable cause of death . And I won 't have you or anyone else ... suggesting otherwise to this boy 's family . Feel free to jump in anytime . Why ? You were doing just fine . [ Sighs ] Do you have a theory on what 's going on here ? I just don 't think it 's lightning . Mulder , wait . - What are you expecting to find here ? - I don 't know yet . Could you stop for a second , please ? Look , after everything that we 've just been through , after all that we 've just seen , I hope you 're not thinking this has anything to do ... with government conspiracies or U.F.O.s. None of the evidence so far indicates either of those possibilities . Well , what are you looking for ? just because a forensic profile isn 't cut and dry ... - doesn 't mean it 's not true . - So Teller 's explanation works for you ? The only possible scientific conclusion ... is that Jack Hammond was killed by lightning . Then this local lightning is a lot more predictable than Teller realizes . It seems to have a definite preference for the type of person is strikes . - What are you talking about ? - Look at the files . Look at all the other victims . They 're all male , age 1 7 to 21 , just like Jack Hammond . At least let 's go see where Jack Hammond was killed . Maybe we 'll find something we both can agree on . Police found Hammond in his car at 1 7 minutes past midnight . The entire electrical system was shorted out . All the circuitry and wiring had melted . Looks like he was trying to get away in a big hurry . Get away from what ? What time was Jack Hammond 's last pizza delivery ? Sometime between 11 : 00 and 11 : 30 . Why ? All these stores would 've been closed by 11 : 00 . Except maybe this one . Seven , eight , nine- [ Scully ] Excuse me . - Oh . Uh- - Ten , eleven- - - What 's your name ? - Uh , Zero . - Zero , do you mind if we talk for a minute ? - What for ? I 'm with the F.B.I. All right . [ Video Games Beeping ] - Were you working here last night ? - Sure . Every night . [ Clears Throat ] Do you recognize this person ? - No , I 've never seen him . - Why don 't you take a closer look . He was here between 11 : 00 and 11 : 30 . He was killed in the parking lot . That was his car . So if you were standing here at this counter , you must 've seen it happen . Oh , that was him . Last I saw , the dude fed a bunch of quarters into this one . Then the ambulance shows up . Before the ambulance showed up , did you notice anything unusual outside ? It 's hard to tell . I mean , the place gets pretty loud and all . Kind a hard to hear much of anything . Did you notice anyone else around who might have seen something ? I can 't , uh- - - I don 't really remember . - Scully , take a look at this . - What ? - What were the names of the other victims ? Uh , Corey Hufferd , Darin Oswald , Burke Roberts and- - Darin Oswald . What 's his middle name ? Darin Peter . Why ? D.P.O. Darin Peter Oswald . Of the five victims , wasn 't he the only one to survive ? - Yes . - Well , he was here last night . ~ ~ [ Rock , Muted ] * * [ Continues , Louder ] - Hey , Mrs. Kiveat . What ? - God , Darin , you scared me . - Where 's Frank ? - Oh , he 's out on a tow . - Is there anything I can help you with ? - No . No , we 're supposed to go to dinner . Are you hungry ? I can get you something to eat . You want something ? - I got jelly donuts . - No , thank you . Are you sure ? They 're from yesterday , but they 're still good . I- - I had one . Hey . Mrs. Kiveat , uh- - Hey , about those things that I said yesterday , - I , uh- - - [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Groans ] Sorry I 'm late , hon . I , uh , had to tow that poor pizza delivery kid 's car . Good to see you . Hey , Darin , I just got a call on the radio . Some people are comin to see ya . They say they 're with the F.B.I. [ Darin ] So this is the dude that died , huh ? It 's pretty harsh , man . - So how did it happen ? - They said he was struck by lightning . [ Chuckles ] Yeah , that happens . Right outside the video arcade . Not a cloud in the sky from what we can tell . You were there last night , weren 't you ? Broke your own record too . - Yeah , yeah . - You must 've seen something . Oh , no , man . You know , when I 'm into my game , man , I 'm there , you know ? It 's like a- - a nuclear explosion could go off , right , and I wouldn 't even notice . Can I ask you a personal question ? - Yeah . - Do you consider yourself a lucky person ? - Me ? I don 't think so . - Yeah . I 'm just thinking about all the people that got hit by lightning , you 're the only one to survive . Don 't you think you 're lucky ? Well , I guess if you look at it like that , you could be right . - I could be considered lucky . - Mulder . - Yeah ? - What 's in your pocket ? - What happened ? - I don 't know . - It just got hot all of a sudden . - Bummer . I 'm gonna go now . - Thanks for your help . - Yeah . I 'll see ya . Teenagers have been into piercing and sadomasochism ... and , um , rebellion extremism . That 's something I think is skipped over . - ~ ~ [ TV : Rock ] - Quit fooling ' with the remote ! And I used to sleep in a belt at night- [ TV Continues ] - Why do you wanna watch all that stuff anyway ? - They 're all a bunch of losers . - At least they 're on TV . - I don 't see you on TV . - [ Belches ] Manners don 't cost , Darin . They 're free . What girl 's gonna want a belching ' fool like you ? - [ Zero Knocking On Door ] Hey , Darin ? - Maybe you 'd be surprised . [ Pounding On Door ] Dude ? You won 't believe it , man . You won 't believe who came by today . - Let me guess . The F.B.I. ? - How did you know ? - They came by the garage . - They did ? How did they find you ? You tell me . You must have said something . No , man ! I didn 't say squat . Wait up ! Come on , man . - You know I wouldn 't do that to you . - [ Cattle Lowing ] Hey , you know , I think you want to be someplace else right now . 'Cause I 'm in the mood for a little barbecue . No , man . Not the cows again . Come on , don 't . Don 't do this . - Not now . - [ Cattle Continue Lowing ] All right , I 'm listenin ' . - I 'm ready ! I 'm ready , so come on down ! - Don 't do it , man ! I 'm out of here ! Come on down ! Come and get me ! - [ Grunts ] - I 'm right here ! Come on , man ! I 'm waitin ' ! Come on , man ! Talk to me ! Come on ! Dude . Are you okay , man ? Excellent . Have that faxed to my office . Right away , if you can . Thank you , Dean . I appreciate it . What happened here , Sheriff ? - Three dead cows . How do you think they died ? - Lightning . That 's right . I just got off with Dean Greiner at the observatory , which , by the way , is just about a mile through those trees . Did they report lightning last night ? They can detect every flash of lightning on this planet . Did you know that ? See , each one emits radio waves at the exact same frequency- - The Schuman Resonance . Eight cycles per second . You can pick it up on any transistor radio . See that , Sheriff ? I did my homework . Not much question that lightning killed these cows last night , just like it killed Jack Hammond the night before last . Well , that 's certainly the way it looks . Let me show you something else . It 's right over here . You see this ? You know what this is ? Huh ? It looks like a fulgarite . That only happens with lightning- - when sandy soil fuses into glass from the heat of a discharge . How much proof do you need ? Hmm ? I 'd say your business here is finished . Mulder , I 'd have to say I think he 's right . [ Mulder ] That we 're wasting our time chasing lightning ? Look at the evidence . What else could it be ? I don 't know yet . This is the first lightning strike I 've ever seen that left behind a footprint . Here we go . Well , considering it 's a partial imprint , there 's a lot of information here . That 's great . Now can you make me a little cherub that squirts water ? The tread looks like a standard military boot . Men 's , size eight and a half . Eight and a half ? That 's pretty impressive . Well , it says it right here on the bottom . But I may have something even better . When I was cleaning the imprint to take the mold , I found trace amounts of a viscous substance actually embedded in the fulgarite . What is it ? Well , I 'd have to conduct a chemical analysis to be sure , but it looks like antifreeze . - Darin Oswald . - But why ? And how ? I don 't know , Scully , but let 's go see if the shoe fits . [ Tires Screeching ] - Learn how to drive ! - You think you own the whole road ? God ! Stupid jerk ! Dude , what 's happening ? What 's going on ? I don 't know . Nothing . You know , I 've been thinking . First time for everything . - [ Horns Honking ] - Oh , damn A.B.S. brakes . I 'm thinking we should go somewhere . Get out of this hole , maybe check out Las Vegas . You could do some serious damage someplace like that . I 'm not going to Las Vegas . I 'm not going anywhere , not without Mrs. Kiveat . What makes you think she 's gonna wanna go anywhere with you ? She failed you , remember ? She thinks you 're a retard . Forget school , man . I 'm talking about proving my love . How are you gonna do that ? By letting her know how I feel- - how all I ever think about is being with her . Wake up , dude . There 's another slight problem . She 's married to your boss . - Maybe I could fry him . - Dude , he 's your boss . Not if he 's dead , he won 't be . Are you high ? With the F.B.I. hanging around ? Just forget about it , okay ? You can 't compete with Frank . He 's good-looking , he 's got his own shop . Plus , he fixes things instead of just smashing stuff up . A woman like that wants someone special . - I 'm special . - Right . I 'm gonna show her just how special I am . [ Laughing ] That was a good one . That was a good one . Come on , man . Let 's go check it out . Darin ain 't worth much . I 'm the first one to say it . But he wouldn 't hurt a soul . What kind of trouble is he in anyway ? Can we have a few minutes , Mrs. Oswald ? Thank you . Mulder . - Yeah ? - We 've got a size match . - Eight and a half ? - Yeah . But it still doesn 't prove that he killed Jack Hammond . I 'm surprised you haven 't already read that issue . I have . April is the cruelest month . But mine didn 't come with this . I found that between Miss April and Women of the Ivy League . - Who is she ? - I don 't know . It looks like it 's from some kind of yearbook photo . See that ? Hmm . There 's a yearbook in Darin 's closet . - [ Scully ] Her name is Sharon Kiveat . - Kiveat . The garage where Darin works is called Kiveat Auto Body . [ Man ] All right , let 's move it through here ! - What happened ? - Some kid got center punched . just got his license too . He 's pretty bad off . Man , that 's rough . You guys ready for me to start clearing the road ? I 'm just directing traffic . You better check with the deputy . - Hey , pal , you okay ? - Yeah . You don 't look so good . - [ Screaming ] - Hey , somebody get the E.M.S. guys ! - You 're gonna be okay . He just collapsed . - What happened ? - Pulse is thready . - I 'll get the kit . Yeah . It 's all right , buddy . Here we go . Where you going ? What are you doing ? Let 's get outta here . I got one , two , three . All right , give me 300joules . - Already charged . - No , it 's not . - Something 's not working here . Get the backup . - What ? Okay . [ Paramedic ] Hang in there , buddy . [ Darin ] Don 't worry , Mr. Kiveat . I 've seen how they do it on TV . [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Man Over Radio ] Dispatch , this is39 . That 's a negative . Wait . We got a rhythm . How the hell- - Rescue 91 1 . Let me give you a hand with that . - Thank you . - Mrs. Kiveat ? My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm with the F.B.I. I know this is a hard time for you , but I 'd like to ask you some questions . You were in my husband 's garage yesterday . Yes , yeah . - I 'm sorry , I can 't . - I 'd like to ask you about Darin Oswald . He was at the scene of the accident , wasn 't he ? Please , I need to see my husband . I just talked to one of the E.M.S. workers . He was pretty rattled . - Why ? - Frank Kiveat 's electrocardiogram . Take a look at this . See that spike there ? That indicates ... that some kind of electrical intervention started his heart . Except according to the E.M.S. worker , the defibrillator wouldn 't charge . - The paddles were dead . - How did he explain this ? He didn 't . All he saw was Darin Oswald touching Kiveat 's chest . I 've been going over Oswald 's chart . There 's something I want you to take a look at . He was admitted to the E.R. five months ago in cardiac arrest . Respiratory failure . Class three burns on his back and his scalp . Resuscitated after 21 minutes . Hang on , this is odd . His blood test showed acute hypokalemia . - Yeah . What is that ? - It 's a severe chemical imbalance ... characterized by high sodium and low potassium levels . - Electrolytes , right ? - Yeah . And what do electrolytes do ? Among other things , they generate the electrical impulses in our body . It 's like every time our heart beats or a neuron fires- - Okay , it 's a leap , Scully , but what if Oswald 's electrolyte imbalance ... is somehow enabling him to generate electricity at levels much higher than normal ? Our body doesn 't work like that . Unless his body is abnormally conductive . Because if that heel print is Oswald 's , that means he conducted millions of volts of electricity into the ground ... - and just walked away . - So you 're saying that he 's some kind of a lightning rod ? No , I 'm saying that he is lightning , and we 've got to get to him before he strikes again . Darin ! - Darin . - Don 't you touch me , man ! - Relax , Darin . - Don 't you touch me ! We just wanna talk to you , that 's all . just ask you a few more questions . I didn 't do anything . How many times do I have to say it ? I don 't know how all those people died . [ Scully ] Why did you run when you saw us ? I was taking a walk . Now , that 's not against the law , is it ? Anyway , you guys should be giving me a medal . - I mean , I saved my boss 's life . - We 're not so sure . Why ? Who told you that ? Who you been talking to ? You been talking to Zero ? He the one who told you that ? What 'd he say ? Not much , except that he 's a hero . - How did he say he revived Kiveat ? - C.P.R. He claims he paid attention in health class . I don 't think he just resuscitated Frank Kiveat . I think he set the whole thing up . - How ? By causing Kiveat 's heart attack ? - See what he did to my phone ? So what ? Are we supposed to charge him with assaulting a cellular phone ? I think we should run a full set of lab tests on this guy . Look where we are . We don 't have the capability or the time to perform those tests . And without a confession , we can only keep him in custody for 72 hours . I can think of only one other person who might be able to help us . Mrs. Kiveat . Please , I can 't do this now . I 'm just leaving for the hospital . Darin Oswald 's in custody , Mrs. Kiveat . We arrested him this afternoon , but we can 't press criminal charges without your help . Is it okay if we come in ? I teach remedial reading at the high school . Darin was my student . How would you describe your relationship with him ? Well , I 'm not blind . I knew he had a crush on me , but I felt sorry for him . I thought he was just- - It just seemed he had more than his share of bad luck . Did you get him the job at your husband 's garage ? Yeah . Then about six months ago , I started getting these phone calls . Someone would call and then hang up . How did you know it was Darin ? The way he looked at me in the garage . The phone calls made me feel the same way . I just knew . When did you first suspect that Darin was involved in something more than prank calls ? - He told me . - He actually confessed to killing those people ? No , but he , uh , he told me that he had powers . - Dangerous powers . - When was this ? Right after the last boy was killed . jack Hammond . See , at first I didn 't believe him . I thought he was just mouthing off . - But after what happened today- - - Did you tell anyone ? Who would 've believed me ? And I was afraid . I was afraid of what he might do tome ... and what he would ... do to my husband . Well , you don 't have to be afraid anymore . You and your husband are safe , as long as we can count on your testimony . - Where 's Oswald ? - [ Teller ] I sent him home . - You released him ? When ? - After I read your arrest report . I 'm gonna go call Sharon Kiveat . " Suspicion of homicide by emission of direct electric current . " - You don 't really believe this ? - I believe Darin Oswald ... was involved somehow in the deaths of those four people , and I believe it was irresponsible for you to let him go . Let me get this straight now . You 're telling me this kid 's throwing lightning bolts ? - In effect . - In effect ? There 's no scientific basis for that claim . This is speculation based on nothing . You have no hard evidence , no proof . You said yourself , Sheriff , even science can 't explain how lightning works . Mrs. Kiveat 's not home . She 's on her way to the hospital . ~ ~ [ Video Game : Rock ] ~ ~ [ Continues ] [ Computer Voice ] K. O. ! [ Female Voice ] Better run home to mama now . - Fight two , ready ? Go ! - Dude ? * * [ Rock ] ~ ~ [ Continues ] Come on , man ! Where are you ? What are you doing , man ? I said I didn 't tell them ! Come on , man . What the- - I didn 't say nothing , man ! I swear ! Why are you doing this , man ? We 're buddies ! [ Bell Dings ] Excuse me , miss . Call security . Have them deny entry to the hospital to everyone except emergency personnel . Sharon ? What is it ? - We need you to come with us right away . - Why ? What 's wrong ? Darin Oswald- - he was released from custody . But how ? How could that happen ? You said that we didn 't have to worry , that we were safe . Look , we don 't have much time . Come with us . We 'll tell you everything . The doctor said that my husband cannot leave this room . - I 'm not gonna leave him here . - [ Mulder ] I 'll stay with him . - You go with Agent Scully . - No . Sharon , please . He 's here . [ Elevator Bell Dinging ] He 's dead . How many other access points to this floor ? Other than the elevator , just the stairway . - Stay with them . I 'm going after Oswald . - Mulder . - Mrs. Kiveat ? - [ Scully ] Darin . - Don 't move . - Where is she ? I said , don 't move . Darin . - Mrs. Kiveat . - Stop ! I 'm warning you . All right , come with me , please , Mrs. Kiveat . 'Cause there 's some things- - stuff that I need to tell you . I want you to step back inside that room . Are you coming with me , Mrs. Kiveat ? - She 's not going anywhere with you , Darin . - I can hurt you ! I can hurt you too . I 'm gonna give you three seconds . One- - - Now , I 'm done fooling around now ! - Stop it ! I 'll go with you . Okay ? If that 's what you want , I 'll go . Just ... stop it . Sharon , we can work this all out right here . No , we can 't . All right . All right then . You were the only person that was ever nice to me . You know that ? I mean- - Hey , you remember that first day in class ... when you wore that green dress with the yellow flowers on it ? How when you stood in front of the window , - you could almost see through it ? - [ Sniffles ] Where are- - Where are we going ? - Where are you taking me ? - I don 't know . Anywhere you wanna go . I got money from a cash machine , you know ? Plus , you know , we can take any car you want . You know , you just take your pick . We can take an Accord or a Maxima , you know . Do you like any of those ? You know , if you don 't wanna go Japanese , you know , - how about a Taurus ? - [ Engine Starts ] No , you 're right , you know . All these cars suck . We 'll just boost one of them for right now and then ... - we 'll trade it later . - [ Vehicle Approaching ] just take it easy , Mrs. Kiveat , all right ? No- - - Mrs. Kiveat ? - Hey ! Come over here . Come on over here ! Mrs. Kiveat ? Mrs. Kiveat , where are you ? Oh , come on , now ! I said I 'd take care of you . What else did you want ? I 'd have given you anything ! Anything you wanted ! - Mrs. Kiveat ! - Okay , son , turn around . Let 's go . Look , I don 't know what kind of trouble you 're up to , but I want some answers . No ! I want some answers ! Where is she ? Come on , now ! You 're pissing me off ! Teller , get out of there ! Teller , get out of there ! Tell me where she is ! [ Scully ] I just got off the phone with the coroner . He 's ruling Teller 's death accidental . Lightning ? What about the scientists at the observatory ? What do they have to say ? They also reported lightning last night . I talked to the D.A. He has no idea how to begin building a case . What about the tests I asked for ? - The results came in five minutes ago . - And ? Nothing unusual was detected , Mulder . The electrolytes , the blood gas levels , brain wave activity . Based on the science of all the data that 's been gathered- - Darin Oswald is a perfectly normal , perfectly healthy kid . ~ ~ [ TV : Punk Rock ] [ Mulder ] You believe that , Scully ?

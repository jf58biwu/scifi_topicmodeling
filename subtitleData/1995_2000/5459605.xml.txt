 - Previously on The Pretender . - Who am I ? - Who am I ? Was I bought ? Stolen ? Where are my mom and dad ? - This is my mother . - Yes , it is . His name is Angelo . Someone who can absorb the intellectual , and literally becomes that person . - I want to know what happened to my mother . - I killed her . That 's what I torture myself believing . Raines is a dangerous man . He may be involved with the murder of Miss Parker 's mother . - I fantasize about killing him . - The only people who know about SL 27 ... are either dead or comatose . SL 27 . Sublevel 27 . - What the hell is that ? - Birthing table . With shackles ? You know the drill . - Better tighten them shackles . - Houdini couldn 't get out of these . - Tighten ' em . - Why ? This convict 's not playing with a full deck ? Deck and a half , brother . All wild cards . Bit a guard 's nose off once . Said he didn 't like the way ... the guard used it to look down on him . A little reeducation will change his diet . Signed , sealed and soon to be delivered . Like I said . Wild cards . That 's a taste of your future . Come on . Now , remember , always irrigate your gums . - I aqua-flush every night . - Good . What about your brother ? He doesn 't even floss . Ike , can I have my sucker , please ? Thank you . We try with him , Dr. Jarod , but I guess Ike will always be a Goofus . - A Goofus ? - And Gallant . It 's all in here . C 'est là-dedans . " Goofus leaves his room a mess . " A morality lesson in a children 's comic book . The convicts took control of the transport van . Moments ago , I spoke with the prison guards lucky to have survived . All of a sudden , he was in the cab . Thought he was gonna kill us right there . - Cool . like he was having fun messing with our minds . He locked us in the back of the van , drove into the pond . Only an inch of air to breathe . I thought I was gonna die . The F.B.I. Task Force , led by Special Agent Korkos ... is on the trail of this criminal , The escapee is 6 ' 1 " , 175 pounds ... and has a distinctive burn mark on his right hand . We 'll have more on this breaking story as information becomes available . - Cool . - He 's incorrigible , Dr. Jarod . - You have to talk . - No . 63 00 : 03 : 36,823 - - 00 : 03 : 37,778 Why ? The anticipation of pain is clearly more effective than the pain itself . - He 's almost at the brink . - But ... - Just do it . - Ow ! You burnt my hand ! - It was real , Sydney . - You bastard ! Get to the infirmary now . Kyle , I 'm sorry ! I would never hurt you . Kyle , I would never hurt you . I would never hurt you . Kyle . In all the time that he 's been here , did you interact with him ? Oh , yeah , we interacted , but it wasn 't always him . He always thought he was somebody different every time you see him . Could talk with a doctor , astronaut , anything . Yeah , so what do you criminal psychologists call that anyway ? - Multiple personalities ? - Something like that . Weird too , man . I mean , this guy spends 10 years in stir ... - Is that why you called him " John Doe " ? I actually believe this guy didn 't know who he was either . He used to tell me there was voices speaking to him in his head all the time . In this guy 's case , the voices were really there . And when those voices told him he was somebody different , he made you believe it too . Really ? I remember one time I played along with him . He told me he was an I.R.S. investigator . So I let him do my taxes . The guy got me a $ 4,000 refund . Hey . I always wondered where he kept that thing . He used to sit there , scribbling in that thing like a madman every time his doctor left . - What 's it say ? - That he 's dangerous . What was his doctor 's name ? I called him " Dr. Wheezy . " Not polite I know , but hey , the guy , he breathed funny . I guess anybody would , dragging around his own oxygen tank though , huh ? We 're giving Angelo every red notebook Jarod ever made . Now tell me again : Exactly what 's Buzz Boy going to do with them ? The theory is that since Angelo can absorb all the personality data given to him ... maybe , just maybe , he might be able to determine where Jarod is ... emotionally and physically . Well , then , let 's see what the potato head can do . Put it down , Angelo . Put him back in his space . I have authorization to use him . No one below me can authorize his use . My father isn 't below you . This better work . Well , I know if it doesn 't , my butt 's on the line . Mmm , wrong piece of anatomy . Hello . This is Harriet . Somebody open a window . It stinks in here . Do we have point of origin on that phone call yet ? A friend called to warn Harriet Tashman about the escaped John Doe . They traced the call at local headquarters when I got there . Special AgentJarod Ness . I was sent by Washington . - Ness ? - No relation . Well , welcome aboard . We need all the help we can get on this one . The escapee is a John Doe . In the 10 years since his arrest , we couldn 't find anything about him . No priors . No fingerprint matches , D.N.A. , nothing . Like he fell from the sky . He was convicted of a string of violent felonies ... on a cross-country binge that ended in the kidnapping of one Harriet Tashman ... whose spilled soup you happen to be standing in . All of those victims shared one common denominator . They were all terrified . This sick puppy relishes psychological torture . Doe stalked Miss Tashman for two days before he grabbed her at gunpoint ... and forced her to drive him away . Miss Tashman had the presence of mind to crash the car into an embankment ... injuring herself and John Doe , but thereby escaping whatever fate he had in store for her . - That was 10 years ago . - And you think he 's after her again ? - Yes . It 's speculation on my part , but all of those actions ... prior to her kidnap were random . He came here for her , and , clearly , he was taking her somewhere . - Aren 't you guys done yet ? - Who are you ? - Jenkins . I 'm the manager of this place . Ness , take Mr. Jenkins 's statement . Oh , come on . I gave a statement to the first guy . - The first guy ? - The F.B.I. agent who was here this morning . - Yeah , yeah . Where to ? - Perfect day like this , I 'll tell you when to stop . Hey , hey , hey , hey . No smoking . You mean me ? No . I mean the invisible guy next to you . Yeah , you . Put it out . - But I just lit it . - I don 't care if you invented it . Put it out . Whatever you say . Calm down , Miss Parker . You 've got to have patience . Patience ? Don 't talk to me about patience . What I need is a cattle prod . Maybe that 'll jump-start the little lab rat . He hasn 't blinked , smiled , moved , nothing . Angelo is absorbing his way through the notebooks chronologically . Right now , he 's in the mid - ' 70s . I believe I saw him squint around 1969 . After looking at the notebook on Marilyn Monroe , I think he giggled . I should never have put myself on the line for you two . This is a waste of time , Syd . - Angelo , no . - Sam , help ! Let go of her , Angelo . Angelo , let go . - Miss Parker , you okay ? - You okay ? - What the hell was that ? A violent reaction to whatever was in the red notebook . It 's not red . The notebook he was absorbing , it 's blue . Residents were stunned by Tashman 's injuries were minor ... and sources report that she does not want to press charges . Un porte-parole de la police At the moment , a spokesperson for the police is telling us ... that they are considering this case closed . Oh , my God . Mom . He scared me . I 'm glad he didn 't hurt you . Angelo has always been a mystery . Something on your mind ? Mr. Raines was upset that I gave you access to Angelo . Boohoo for Dracula . Angelo is his project . Apparently , Raines has been worried about him becoming violent . - The guy is a marshmallow . - Still , he attacked you . - That justifies Raines 's fear and concern for you . - Concern ? Daddy , you may not want to hear this , but I think he 's working behind your back . He would not defy me . I 'm sorry . Daddy , I know that that tone is inappropriate . No , no , no . You may be right . I 've never doubted Raines 's dedication , but he 's been different . Ever sinceJarod 's been out , I 've wondered if there was something . Trust me , Daddy . There is . Do you have anything tangible ? If you should find something real , something I could trust ... I 'll bring it to your attention immediately . My grandpa was the caretaker here before me . Miss Harriet , she 's the woman who owns this place ... gave me the job after Grandpa died . She sends me money in the mail to keep it looking pretty for her . Funny , huh ? - Funny ? - Well , that she wants it kept looking so pretty . She ain 't been here in 10 years or more . Do you know where she is ? How to reach her ? No . I haven 't talked with her or anything . Sometimes ... Sometimes I wonder if it 's really her that sends the money . Have you ever seen this woman before ? - I have to go . - Joe Bill , please . This is my mother . I don 't know where she is . Never knew my mama . All there ever was was me and Grandpa . He says we 're not supposed to talk about them . That they don 't live here . - They lived here ? - Over the barn . Almost never came out . Always alone . She had red hair ... and he made planes out of wood . Always planes . When I was little , Miss Harriet , she taught me how to read good ... gooder . These people always seemed like ... faisaient penser au livre that book about the little girl who lived in the attic . Her name was ... Anne . Anne Frank ? - The family - Hiding . They left right after Miss Harriet got took . Maybe it 's them that sends the money , huh ? Joe Bill , do you know where they went ? Just went . They left some stuff . - This is Agent Meadow . We got a lead on Doe . - Korkos wants everyone here now . 262 00 : 18 : 23,263 - - 00 : 18 : 24,139 - I 'm on my way . - I 'll be back . - Cabbie 's in County General psych ward . No injuries , but massive shock . - Doc says he was literally scared nearly to death . - What happened ? He was tied into his seat . Mouth taped shut . Eyes taped open . - Like he wanted him to watch something . - His fate . Doe parked his cab on top of some railroad tracks facing a tunnel . Did the cabbie give us any leads ? It 's hard to talk after some psycho 's put his cigarette out on your tongue . But he did say something about Doe repeating : " I decide who lives or dies . " All the more reason for us to find him before he finds Harriet Tashman ... if he hasn 't already . This blue notebook belonged to another subject . ll s 'appelle Kyle et a participé au programme Caméléon , under the direction of then Dr. Raines . I guess it only makes sense that you 'd have more than one freak in your farm system . What makes Kyle so special ? The fact that he was officially released from the center ... before the date on the blue notebook . Are you saying that Raines kept Kyle for his own project ? Where ? Where ? SL-27 ... I rerouted the security system ... so if anyone has this place monitored , it should be all right for about 30 minutes . Look , since we don 't have much time ... why don 't you keep your mouth shut and your eyes open . Fine with me . I don 't wanna be down here in the first place . Over here . My God . Somebody was forced to live here . And from the look of these striations ... he spent a great deal of time trying to claw his way out of here . Broots , where are you ? - Down here . Down the hall . - What is it ? - It 's a Brainchild . One of the first generation of super computers . Raines 's Brainchild . This is what he used to record his work down here . in my early years with Jarod . And this was what we stored his sims on ... before transferring them to D.S.A. Pretty useless now . Unless ... those analogs were backed up . - In there ? How ? Computer club in college . Do whatever it is you have to do . If it 's in there , I want it out . - Call me when you have it . - You want me to stay down here ? Alone ? - You still have 20 minutes . Come on , Sydney . Hi , Kyle . It 's me , Jarod . Remember ? We 're not supposed to talk . - Where are you from ? - I don 't know . - Me neither . I only remember here . Do you know who you are ? What did you find ? - Ten million bits of information . A lot of it 's about Kyle . My machines are sorting it out now ... but I did manage to transfer one sim onto a D.S.A. format . - It 's hot . I 'm tired . I 've been in Memphis for three days . Can 't sleep . There 's too many people outside this motel . I 'm getting ready . I 'm gonna make history . I 'm gonna close a bleeding wound . You don 't think Dr. King is a good man . No . He 's dividing our country . We had laws , and we had order . King doesn 't obey , and Americans , they 're afraid . Maybe it 's you who 's afraid . No . He 's the menace . Kennedy gave in to him , and Hoover can 't stop him . It ends now . He has to die . Now who are you to make thatjudgment ? I decide who lives or dies . - My God ! He did it . - Did what ? Raines . He always wanted to do this experiment with one of the Pretenders . He thought that if he could feed him enough negative reinforcement ... he could strip them of their morality . And he could , uh , create a sociopath . I decide who lives or dies . You 're all set there . Welcome to the Bay State . We demand you sign the admission of aggression . - We 'd rather die . - What about you , Lieutenant ? - Maybe Jarod 's right . - Damn it ! That 's it . What are you doing ? - I never should 've allowed it . A Flying Cross . Did they give this to you ? No . I 've just always had it . - Dr. Raines let you keep it ? - Dr. Raines is my friend . It 's origami . I 'll teach you how to make it sometime . - Where do they keep you ? - They take me down an elevator . I 'm not sure where , but there 's sounds in the ceiling . From the air vents . The speaker they use to talk to us , is there a wire leading from it ? Yeah . Why ? I think I know how we can talk ... without them hearing us . What did you do with Kyle ? Don 't commit political suicide over ancient history . You ignored a Tower directive when you kept If I were you , I 'd stop dwelling on the past . Jarod is your only lifeline in this place ... and the longer he 's out there ... the weaker your influence on him becomes . On my grave , Raines , I 'll find him . That son of a bitch could be anywhere . All right . Here 's a profile our " psychological geniuses " have put out on John Doe . In a nutshell , it says he 's a time bomb waiting to detonate . From here on out I 'm ordering a PAC on up to a 2-1-11 . A shoot to kill order ? Sir , I admitJohn Doe is unpredictable , but he 's never killed anybody . Spoken like a true Clinton-era recruit . We 're talking about a head case who put a cigarette out on a man 's tongue . That sound like somebody you wanna try and reason with ? About another half hour I 'll have the next SL 27 sim ready to ... Back in 15 minutes . Hey , kids , it 's time for Uncle Buddy 's cartoon extravaganza . - God I love this show . Now a news update from the Channel 3 news center ... While the F.B.I. continues its dogged investigation ... of the recent prison escapee known only as John Doe ... agency authorities admit that they are rapidly running out ofleads .. in their attempt to locate and apprehend ... Angelo ! What are you doing out here ? Agent Korkos is appealing to the public for any information that may lead to Doe 's arrest ... Wait , wait . I didn 't know ... I didn 't mean anything . Wait a minute . No , no . Wait . Wait . SL-27 ? - AngelO Brains told you this ? - Not with words ... but there 's no doubt what he was saying . John Doe is Kyle . They lived up there . Not so clean . I haven 't never been up here . Not allowed . So everything 's just the way it was when they left ? Think so . Man made one for me one Christmas . I liked it . - There was a baby here . - Used to hear it cry . Never saw it . Wasn 't allowed up here . - What is it ? - My compost pile . Eyes watching me from up here . Little eyes . Staring . Scared me . J 'ai jamais vu le bébé . Never saw the baby , but the baby saw me . " And under the hand of God ... Ye little children shall never be lost . " You 're not gonna believe what 's on this disk , Sydney . - Show me . Show me . - I 'm glad you 're alone . - Why ? Well , I 'm not Scooby-Doo . What 's the problem , Broots ? Miss Parker , I know you don 't respect me ... but I just don 't think you should watch this disk . Play the damn disk . Hate dictates reality . Plus tu te concentres The sooner you embrace it and focus it upon your enemy ... the sooner total control will be realized . It 's more than just a word . Hate is a feeling . I have it in here . Very good , Kyle . Feel it grow . Let it grow . Tomorrow I 'll take you to theJersey Shore , to the Dragon House . - I feel safe there . - And you always will . He was teaching him to hate my mother . To shoot my mother . I 'm sorry , Miss Parker . This explains Angelo 's sudden attack on you . I have to tell my father about this . - If he doesn 't already know . This is the Centre . We 're talking about my mother 's death . Everything we have learned can be traced back to SL 27 . If anyone figures that out , well . Only your heart , Parker , can measure the Just be careful . I 'm sorry you had to see this . Broots , I do respect you . - I 'm very pleased with that . - Oh , thank you . " I decide who lives or dies . " It 's a rough report . You said that if I learned anything , I should bring it to you ? I 'm figuring Kyle was kept here at least 10 years after the scheduled release . Where did these experiments take place ? I 'm not sure . Exactly how did you learn about Raines ? I 'm S.I.S. , Daddy . You taught me well . You have proof to back this up ? I 'd hoped that it would be enough I were your daughter . Of course . But I have people to answer to . I need tangibles . I have a source . Can we just leave it at that ? I should 've known . Another garden path obscured byJarod 's weeds . Jarod had absolutely nothing to do with me learning about this . This report says that , um , - To hate . To kill . Kill ? Who ? I 'm not sure ... yet . Did you know what Raines was doing ? Would I have allowed him to continue if I did ? There was a time when I knew everything that went on here . Maybe my time has passed . I 'm sorry , Daddy . Let me run with this . Please . And I will bring you back the best tangible evidence that there is . - What ? Can you hear me ? Where are you ? Three doors down from the corridor . Where are you ? Four . I 'm right next to you . - Did you hear that ? - Yes . Maybe they know . Do you think they know we 're talking ? - Tell me about the Dragon House . Was it some kind of ad hoc torture chamber ? A Centre asylum ? A safe house ? - This is about Kyle , isn 't it ? - Kyle is out there . Was he sent to kill my parents ? My God , Jarod ! I don 't know . I swear it . I 'll find answers . Quickly , Sydney . Please . - Broots , I need you to do something for me . - Hack into Mr. Raines 's computer . Hey , Peter . This is Dr. Jarod . How are your gums ? - They 're pink . - Listen , I was wondering ... I 'd be happy to do you a favor . New England Air ? I 'd like to book a round-trip shuttle to Boston , please . All right . Gather around , people . We finally got something . A phone tip . Witness saw John Doe try to pry open an A.T.M. machine in Boston . - A tip from whom ? - Some kid named Goofinski . - How do you know it 's him ? Look . Look at that scar , Ness . That 's him . All right . Foster , Caine , Charles . We 're going to Boston . - I 'm checking this out personally . - What about me ? I want in . Last thing I need is an agent with a cold trigger finger ... - when I tell this crackpot to put his cigarette out . End of discussion . You 're an 18-11 on this one , Ness . Oh , great . Desk duty . The Dragon House is located in a place called Delphi Shores , New Jersey . - Thank you , Sydney . - Chances are Raines will be ... zeroing in on the Dragon House too . As you know , I have no choice but to give Miss Parker the same information . Go there and you won 't be alone . Loneliness is something I left at the Centre . One last thing , Jarod . If you find Kyle ... you have to know he 's not the person you once knew . Neither am I. - Tell me where they are . - I can 't . I heard once that the anticipation of pain ... is far more effective than pain itself . - we 're gonna find out . My name is Jarod . I 'm here to help you . You 're late . She 's with me . I love a class reunion . I knew I never should 've let you two get together . Boys , let 's go . I 'm not going anywhere with you . - Neither am I. Get ' em ! Kyle , you know me . I 'm Jarod . They said Jarod was dead . Now I decide who lives or dies . Not this time . I hit the Lotto ! Jarod , no . ! Which one ? Which one ? - Get Kyle ! Get in . You could 've gotten us both killed . Why did you stop me from shooting him ? I stopped you because Kyle is your brother .

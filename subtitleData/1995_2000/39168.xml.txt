It 's as if you 're trying to take me all in . I 'm sorry sir ! He 's looking up to you , ' brother ' . He wants to be a Gokudo just like you . Are you serious ? Yes sir ! Hagane , was it ? Yes sir ! I 'll be out for a while . Hold onto this for me . Get off Stop him ! It 's me ! Why you ... ! You fuck ! You idiot ! Full Metal Gokudo 7 Years After . 7 years after Please , give me another month . Please . Don 't you dare fuck with me ! You think we 're fucking kids ? I can 't give what I don 't have . I can 't do anything about it . But what about the tools ... the car . You have lots of ways to come up with the cash . That 's how everyone become slaves of the bank . Then why don 't you sell your own body ? Your kidney ... your liver your eyeballs . You keep threatening me and I 'll call the poli ... ! You think we Yakuza are afraid of the police ? I 'll freaking take out your eyeballs ! Bro ! ... bro , you keep out of this . Hey gramps ... gramps ... Hey ... I 'll kill you both ! I 'll kill you ... ! Hey ! I 'll kill you two and then myself ! Come back here so I can kill you ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll die too ! Hey !

Junji ... are you sure you can do it this time ? What 's with the pause ? Tell me the truth . Think Hagane can do it ? I doubt it 's possible . You idiot . Even my ' younger brother ' says you can 't do it . Matsuda . Yes sir . You go out with Junji . I pair him with Hagane any longer he 'll become no good too . Hagane . Yes sir . Why don 't you go clean the shit off the toilets ? Kaori , I 'm here to get you . You want money AGAIN ? Come on ... just 50,000 . 30,000 ... how about just 20,000 ? I 'll give it back two-fold . Please ? Please ? Sorry ... I think I 'm a bit tired . What ... I thought you 're the role model for pre-mature ejaculations . Shut up ! Oww ... What do you think you 're doing ? Don 't mess with me ... You think I 'm scared of you ? You think a half-man like you even has the right to act like that ? Stop fucking around , you retard ! God , that 's fucking cold ! Who the hell is this ? What 's wrong ? What do you think you 're doing , ya old fuck ? Sorry . My bad . What do you mean " my bad " ? Come on ... get up . Let go . Who do you think I am ? I 'm Yakuza . You 're going to pick a fight with the Yakuza ? Well ? Come on . Just walk away . You think you can fool us , ya retard ? A Yakuza my ass ! Anything but that wallet ! Shut the fuck up ! How much is inside ? There 's barely 10,000 . - For real ? - Oh Come on ... Come on , let 's go . All right . Retard . Where is it ... where is it ... There ... found it ! I found it ! Thank god ... Brother ! What are you doing ? I dropped my wallet . Matsuda was looking for you , Brother . Huh ? What for ? About Tousa being let out tomorrow morning . Boss . Chief Yokoi is here . Oh , I see . I can 't believe you had the balls to call me out here . Yomo ... what do you want ? You see , tomorrow ... a guy named Miryuuki is going to be let out . Taka , what do you think about that rumor ? Rumor ? Yeah ... the one about the head retiring and either our boss or Tousa succeeding . What I think ? Well , our boss well probably be the one to take the next head . But Tousa 's a favorite of the head ... and besides , he 's definitely rolled some heads before . That 's all in the past . Nagame 's all part of Misatsurigo now . Given how battles within the same province aren 't allowed , you think they 'd try anything ? We 're still in control . Brother , just be careful . The boss isn 't a big fan of yours . Taka ... I know I 'm not cut out for Gokudo . The reason I 'm still hanging around is because I thought that maybe things would change under Tousa . Mr.Tousa ! Welcome back . We 've come to escort you . Please come this way . Here . I 'm terribly sorry . The boss still in Headquarters at Tokyo due to work . How is the head 's heart holding out ? Not very good . He 'll be in danger if he collapses again . I see ... He 's in the hospital with our Brother at the moment . It 'll continue until noon , so for now , we should head back to our office and settle down . We 've made arrangements for you nearby . Should I stop ? No ... keep going . Yes sir . Hello . Ah , hello Chief . You go escort Brother . Ah yes , sorry to make you wait . This way . Ah , yes ... sure . Yes ... I understand . Yes ... yes ... Now I remember . You 're that recruit from back then . Yes sir . You goddamn bastards ! It 's huge ! They took mine out ... Hey , you 're that Yakuza dude . What 's with that pissy outfit ? No violence . You mean , " Please don 't hurt me " , right ? Hey ! He 's a monster ! You fucker ! You fuck ! Hey ... is my cock big ? Is mine bigger or is Hagane 's bigger ? Come on , take a look . See , mine has pearls stored inside See ? They 're coming out ... Ah , you 're right ... I love it ! You know , Hagane died . I 'm the one that led him there . Well anyway , I wanna see you play with yourself . Looks like you 're up . There 's nothing to worry about . I 'll let you move in a little while . Listen up . You 're not complete yet . There 's a lot of systems not complete yet so I can 't have you move around by yourself . It 's all over if your life systems go . You want to talk ? The fuck is this ? Calm down . Who are you ? The name 's Hiraga Genpaku , a self-proclaimed genius scientist . Well , the world hasn 't realized my greatness and has called me an Otaku ... or Prof. Insane . That 's not what I 'm asking . Why am I here ? You don 't remember anything ? Maybe the remember circuits aren 't completely operational yet . You remember now ? You were killed along with someone else . I was the one that brought you back to life . I 've always dreamed of building a cyborg ever since I was little , so I amassed a collection of dead bodies and tinkered around with them . Dead bodies ... ? Yep . From the black market They 're surprisingly easy to get . Unknown people that were killed , or any type of death that can 't be made public . You were just one of them . I bought 2 bodies 3 months ago for 2 million . From who ? Who knows ? All I did was to go pick up the bodies from the designated location . We contacted through phone and I paid by wire transfer . I don 't even know how he looks like . That 's just part of the rules . Both bodies were filled with holes . Amazingly , the other man 's heart and your brain had yet to cease functioning . That was the type of body I was waiting for . What I 've been researching had reached a level where I could modify humans as long as the heart and brain was intact . So you were incredibly lucky . You gotta be kidding me . I 'm just like cut up of parts . Don 't worry about that . It 's easy to make your face and body look the same . The only thing I 'm lacking is enough Chogokin ( Mazinger Z ! ) . I 'll make you Full Metal soon enough . Full Metal ? Yeah ... a body that can deflect gunshots easily . See ... your abilities are amazing . Your left eye has infra red eye sight your right eye has x-ray vision . You are much above any man . 10 on 1 odds should be nothing . Why would I even want that ? I 'd rather die ... than to have this freakish body ! You 'd rather die ? I don 't think you understand why I saved you . It 's all your doing isn 't it ? No it isn 't . No ? It 's because the other man became your shield and tried his best to protect you . I saved you out of respect for him . Tousa ... Like I said , his heart is placed within your body . He 's still alive within your body . Is the heart the only thing that got transferred over ? The hands and legs are his too . I copied the parts that relate to physical ability from him . Anything else ? His dick . His dick ? And his balls too , of course . So I have Tousa 's dick ? Well , it 's not that I couldn 't use yours ... but you 're the most powerful man out there . I can 't let you be lacking in any other areas . That and one more thing . Tousa ... Please ... finish up the rest . A demon slayer ... The only thing you can eat is metal . Anything else you eat won 't give you much in the way of energy . What about taste ? You don 't need it . Oh and while you 'll slowly lose touch with your emotions , there will be times when you won 't be able to control any new feelings that comes up . If that does happen , all the systems will go haywire and your body will essentially short circuit , so be careful . I lose my feelings ? Liking people or hating them ... getting mad or sad ... you don 't need to put up with all that bullshit . You 're kidding me ... I also installed a circuit that will suppress your feelings as a precautionary measure . If you do feel a sudden rush of emotions coming onto you , push right here and chant this little " spell " All spell ? All good boys go to sleep . Say that three times . Say what ? It 's a nursery rhyme . My grandmother sang it to me often when I was little . Defense stance for attacks coming from your right , Defense stance for attacks from your left . They 're pretty much the same ... Charge forward . Retreat . We 're done . You 're now complete . What are you doing ! ? What are you doing ? I 'm leaving . Leave ? Why ? We were killed . That fact just can 't get out of my mind . Don 't be stupid . You want to get revenge or something ? You 're going to be the champion of justice ! Remember ? All good boys go to sleep . You 're only acting like this because you 're not in control of your emotions yet . Prof ... I 'm a Gokudo . As a Gokudo ... there 's something I must do before I lose my feelings . No ! You 're a Hero ! Don 't push yourself ! Remember not to get too emotional ! It 's me . What 's up ? Lead just left . Capture him . Don 't worry . I can 't track him . I 'll see his battle capabilities . What about the general ? There 's no need to contact him . Where do you think you 're hitting , you retard ? Well ? Sorry sir . Use more of your hip . Yes sir . One thing the Chief Fuku hates is bad golfers . You 're never going to be promoted if that 's all you have . I 'm sorry sir ! You idiot ... If this is what the Chief Fuku wants , this is what we have to give him . It 's his era now . Yes sir . Try another swing . Yes sir . Are you an idiot ? Keep your shoulder straight . Yes sir ! God damn my father ... Tousa 's not alive anymore ! Brother ? Is that really you ? I got saved by a certain doctor . What about Tousa ? W , well ? What about it ? Was Tousa also saved ? You 're sure about this ? I see ... Hagane ... could you tell that to the chief ? Come on ... go to tell and tell him the news yourself . Okay ? Brother ... could you explain to me what happened ? Could you tell me who it was that attacked Tousa and me ? I , I don 't know . Why did you abandon us back then , brother ? I , I didn 't ! Ha , Hagane ! You see ... I want revenge . Brother ... Kamane ... Ha ... ga ... I 'm sorry sir ! But I thought I was going to die ... You fucking retard ! Go contact the others ! Hagane 's been kicked out of the family . He 's none of our concern , you retard . Just tell him to go fuck off . Brother . Give it a rest , brother . Why are you acting all tough for ? You can 't do it . You 're not Tousa . I 'll ask Paida to do it , so just apologize and re-enter the family . Junji ... are you in love with Naomi ? What ? I 'm not going to forgive you if you make her cry . How ... could he be cool ? You think anyone 's going to show up ? Nah . Huh ? A blackout ? Hey ... Hey ! You have a visitor ! So you 're the one . I 'm here ... to meet the Chief . You idiot . You fuck ! Bastard ! That bastard ... Stop him ! What is he , a monster ? We 're shooting him and he 's still moving . Come on ... do something quick ! Kyo ! Wait ... let 's talk . Please ? So you 're the one that wanted Tousa dead . I shall have my revenge . No ! I was just carrying out orders ! It was Maeda that was behind everything ! Tousa was in the way of their plans too . That idiot ! Then who 's the one that sold the dead bodies to make money ? It 's not me ! It 's Maeda ! He told me that he 'll take care of the bodies . That 's what he said ! So he was in it from the start ... That 's what he said ! He told me that he didn 't mind if I killed both of them . He said ... He said what ! ? He said that since he wasn 't of any use , selling him for money would the best thing to do . He doesn 't know what you 're capable of ! Take the phone ... talk to him ! Come on ! I 'll fucking kill you all ! Hey ! Start packing ! What 's wrong ? Hagane ... that retard ! He annihilated the Kamane ! What the ! ? Holy shit ... You fuck ... Hagane ! I 'll get the boss . Kill him ! Come on ! Kill me if you can ! Know well that I have Tousa 's backing when you do ! He 's so cool ! You fucker ! What the ! ? What are you doing ! ? The hell are those retards doing ! ? Hagane ! I ... never ordered anyone to kill Tousa ! It was him ! Maeda did it on his own ! You think I believe that ? It 's the truth ! I stake my authority as Chief on it ! Got it ! Trust me . T , this is ... It really is Tousa 's dragon ... W , what is the meaning of this ! ? I inherited Tousa 's body . What ? Inherited ? Tousa lives inside my body . Forgive me Tousa ! It 's all my fault ! Forgive me ... I ... should 've stepped down ! Then I wouldn 't have lost you ! I was a fool ! Forgive me ! Please ... Hagane ! Hagane ... You 're going to take Maeda 's place . Got it ? We 'll fight together ! First ... we 'll get the others inside the group . Got it ! ? Don 't fuck with me ! I 'm not going to be fooled ! It 's going to break ! Stop it ! Stop it ! I 'm not going to leave any part of you moving ! You 're going to die ! Let him go . Taka ... that 's not going to work on me . I 'll shoot anyway . Taka , please ... don 't stop me ! I have to get Tousa 's revenge ! Then kill me first . I don 't care what your reason is , but I can 't have you kill our boss . I don 't care who it is , but I will protect him with my life . The Nakame group is finished . Maeda 's dead too . Isn 't that enough , Kei ? There 's no point in hiding . This is the only place for you to return . Fuck ! What 's with this fucking sorry excuse for legs ? The Peach Ranger has to be cute ! It 's huge ... It 's been 8 years ... He was the one that dumped me . He told me that staying with him won 't make me happy . He then jumped out to go kill someone with his sword . He was a Gokudo . He stayed in jail for 7 years and I hear he got killed the day he was let out . What an idiot . Why are you here ? I was just aimlessly wandering along ... and this town just called out to me for some reason . For some reason ? But now ... I think I understand why . It reminded me of the place I was born . That 's odd . You two don 't look a thing alike but I get the feeling that he 's by my side when I 'm with you . You know , I think I 'll stay here for a while too . Do you mind ? W , what are you doing ? I , I just like to do it every once in a while . It 's like a charm . I don 't get it . He 's been there for 3 months . Why ? What cold hands ... What they say must be true . You know , about people with cold hands having warm hearts ? It 's really odd ... The size of your hands are also similar to his , Keisuke . Please ... just once . Make love to me . I want to forget about him ... I want to be free . I tried so many times to fall in love with someone else to no avail . But I know that you 'll make me forget about him , Keisuke . Yukari ... Keisuke , do you hate me ? I love you . Then why ! ? I can 't ! I ... love you . But ... my body 's ... It doesn 't matter ! I know you 're bothered about your body . But ... no matter how your body looks , I 'll still love you . I lost about half of my body due to an accident . Half of my body 's made of metal . I 'm just another monster ! Aren 't you shocked ? But I still love you ! No-- - ! Good-bye , Keisuke . I wish I could 've stayed by your side longer . But I know that I won 't be able to forget about him if I stay with you . I can 't love both of you . That was a great hit . You 're as good as they say . You 're very good today . I guess so . So Saratake , how 's it feel ? Oh , I still have a ways to go . I 'll always be with you , Chief Fuku . This is just the beginning . You 're one hell of a bastard . Hey ! Pitch ! I will have his revenge ! Get the fuck up . Hey , you okay ? Take care of him ! Hey ! Who the hell are you ? Well ? Come on . Aren 't you Tousa 's girl ? Kill me ! Hey ... give her to me . Shit ! Bro ... Are you dead ? What do you want ? So you 're still alive . You know this girl , don 't you ? What did you do to Yukari ! What did you do ! I 'll talk ! She ... tried to kill Saratake and she screwed up . What ! ? And she got captured ? She called out your name when she got caught . So that 's how we knew where you were ... And then the boss ... sent me ! Yes ? Is that you , Hagane ? I hear you 're real powerful . She got Yuuta you know . He has a big investment you know . What do you want ? My life ? Why would I care about that ? What I want is more than that . I want a killer . Listen up . I want you to take out Masashirenbo for me . I 'll give you back the girl if you do a good job . She 's saying how much she wants to touch Tousa 's back . Sir ! Sir ! The hell is he ? You idiot ! Save me ... Don 't worry . Those three are scared shitless of you . They won 't kill the girl . Hey Kei , it 's me . Don 't worry about the girl . I 'll keep the promise and return her intact . What 's going to happen to Musashirenbo ? Someone under Fuku 's going to take care and they 'll restructure the whole thing . That and a lot of other things . And you , Taka ? With everyone else dead , I became the new local boss . I see ... so I guess your in less danger now . Kei ... it 's still not too late . Why don 't you come back and we can join up together ? That was our dream , wasn 't it ? It 's too late for me now . Ken you always did the exact opposite of what I wanted you to do . You were such a pain . That 's true . What ? Kei , I gotta hang up now . Later . Come on ! Hey , I found him ! It 's too bad ... I wanted him to work for us a bit longer . He would 've been useful against Nishida . There 's nothing to worry about , Chief . We 'll just look for the one that made this in the first place . Yes ... we could have an army of living soldiers . Exactly ... a robot that is loyal only to us . Everything 's ready , sir . Good . Chief , everything is perfect here ... Really ? Really . Really really . God damn it ! I can 't believe they tried to kill me too ! I might as well side with you then ! Bro ... you better get our revenge ! Look ... she 's still sleeping . Chief ... Now that 's harsh ... She 's a pretty fine girl , too ... Hey , see if she 'll still conscious . Hey you there ... No ! Stop it ! Hey ... open your mouth . She might bite ... you sure you want to do this ? I bet it 'll taste pretty good . Well ? Open up your fucking mouth . God damn it ... Bro---- - ! Just a bit longer . All right , let 's go . Yes sir . Thank you for coming , sir . Thank you , sir . Well that sucked . Come on , let 's go . Hagane ! Forget him , just go . Come on ! Go get him ! Hey Kei ! Looking pretty cool there . Taka , just walk away . Taka ... please . I don 't want to ... That 's why you couldn 't raise up . I won 't run . I 'm a Gokudo . Taka ... that hurt . I 'm bleeding . I 'm alive then ? I thought ... I 'm still human , right ? Kei ... this is good bye . Hey ... is anyone here ? Is anyone here ? Hey . Hagane . Hey ! Hey . What are you , out of batteries , you idiot ? Full Metal ... Gokudo , I guess . Bro 's ... dead ? What the ! ?

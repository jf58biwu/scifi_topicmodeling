 Late , late , late ! Citizens , I see that you are not in your assigned home forums this morning . Um , we 're late because ... - You 're wearing a ... toga . - Yes , I am . And in the future I trust you 'll pay closer attention to the school dress code , as well . Carry on ... citizens . ( Bell rings ) Is it just me or has our universe been slightly altered ? That , or it 's toga day . Hey . Is it toga day ? - More like toga world . - Lis , what did you do ? How come whenever you find yourself in some new fantastic reality , it 's always my fault ? You 're right . Maybe my gaseous burps ripped a hole in the space-time continuum . It could 've been anybody . It could 've been ... Oh , boy . Oh , boy , what ? Chett . Chett asked to go on an adventure in ancient Rome . He promised to be good . I ought to have my head examined . Once we find the history hopper we can go and get Chett . If we find out what he did to screw up the timeline , maybe we can fix it . Anti-gravity beanie . History hopper . Oh ! WYATT : Ancient Rome , here we come . Okay , keep your eyes peeled for whatever Chett did to alter history . Remember , it may be something so small we might not notice . A single slender thread pulled from the intricate tapestry of time . - Like this matchbook ? - Exactly ! Like that matchbook . ( People clamoring ) Or that jeep . Hey , freaks what are you doing here ? ( Disco music playing ) Chett , what are you doing ? I told you not to meddle with the past . - You 're destroying our future . - Your future , pit-lick , not mine . I 'm not going back . This place is a bronze-age party zone . - Chett , listen . - I 'm not Chett anymore . I 'm Chettus Maximus mystic traveler from another land . Bringer of magic and wonder . Here you go . Wards off evil spirits . Now , if you 'll excuse me I have a wet toga contest to judge . - He 'll need a water boy . - Stay focused . If we want to fix history we have to decontaminate the timeline . We need to collect everything Chett brought back with him . ( Horn honking ) MAN : Hey , let me ride it ! This may be harder than I thought . Where are the others ? You did tell them there was a slave revolt meeting today . Yes , Bodacious , but most of our followers were out partying with Chettus Maximus all night . The suicide squad has the dry heaves . How am I supposed to stoke the fires of rebellion when the oppressed masses are too drunk to know how oppressed they are ? ( Slurping ) ( Loud belch ) Chettus is ruining everything . Come on , guys . One more , we got ourselves a hack . Are you Chettus Maximus ? - You got it . - You 're under arrest . Hey ! Easy , pal . Okay , I was being greedy . The emperor wants a cut , right ? - I 'm cool with that . - Shut up . All bow down before his mighty and omnipotent highness smiter of his enemies potent and all-powerful ruler of Rome Emperor Timidius . Are you quite sure he 's all chained up ? - Yes , my liege . - Ah . ( Fanfare playing ) So ... you are Chettus Maximus . At last , I meet the man who has so bewitched my subjects . Excuse me , Your Mightiness . I didn 't mean to ... Silence ! Do you not know who I am ? I am Timidius , the greatest warrior this empire has ever known . Observe . ( Snaps finger ) Yes , you . Come forward . Observe while I dispatch our mightiest warrior in hand-to-hand combat . ( Whispering ) So you see , Chettus you 'd best not trifle with me - if you value your life . - Uh ... Okay . Now , tell me the truth . Have you been sent here to assassinate me and to seize my throne ? ! Hell , no , Emperor . You 've got nothing to worry about . I just came here to party and I brought you gifts . Gifts ? I rather like gifts . What sort of gifts ? These are pork rinds . They 're a delicacy in my land . A delicacy , you say . I am feeling a bit peckish . Oh , my . It doesn 't taste like anything . Air . - I can 't stop , you know . - They 're delicious . They 're very bad , actually , but ... may I have another ? Thank you . What are we going to do ? Chettus has won the favor of the emperor . Well , then I must gain the favor of Chettus . I will sacrifice my body for the rebellion . What do you think ? I think you 're a jerk . You 're stupid . What a pig . Bite me . Why should I trade you my mystic oracle ? The cow says ... ( Cow mooing ) Yea , it speaks the truth . The cow does say , " moo . " With the power of this all-knowing device I will be unbeatable on the battlefield . Look , the cow goes moo , the pig goes oink . You know that stuff . What you really need are these . Magic beans . Magic beans ? Plant them and a magic vine will grow . Yes ? And ... then you ... Gird your loins with the vine and you will be invincible . Hmm . All right , it 's a deal . - Magic beans ? - Tic tacs . You are right , Chettus . This side is tingling . Takes care of them flakes , too . Another cold one , your worship ? Oh , Chettus , you have brought me many wonders . This box of tiny minstrels . These oil-sodden treats . Tough-actin ' tinactin . Please accept ... This slave girl as a token of my thanks . I am Bodacious . You certainly are . I have to have that hand . I 'll trade you 20 magic beans for it . Oh , but this is the largest hand in all of Rome . When I raise it , others follow . When I wave it , legions cheer . Not for all the magic beans in Rome would I part with it . Okay , but beware- - others covet the giant hand . Even now enemies of the giant hand conspire against you plotting to sever it from your arm . 20 magic beans it is . - Five . - Done . So , trying to peddle your phony magic beans to some other unsuspecting victim ? I planted those beans and nothing happened . - Did you water them ? - Naturally . With goat 's blood ? Don 't tell me how to grow magic beans ! Take them away ! The lions will eat well tonight . You just made a big mistake , pal . You 'll rue the day you tangled with the magic bean lady . GARY : You 're making a mistake ! - Come on , let us out of here ! - You 're in big trouble , pal . Okay , look , we 'll worry about fixing the timeline later . Right now , just zap us out of here . What 's that ? Since electricity hasn 't been harnessed , I 'm powerless . That 's why I brought this battery pack- - to power my magic . I can also see if my nose is shiny . Hang on . To your togas . Damn ! I knew I should have used those bunny batteries . ( Fanfare plays ) All bow down before the potent and all-powerful master of Rome wrathful and merciless smiter of his enemies ... Yes . Quite all right . All that 's very nice , yes . Uh ... ahem . My people , today I present to you the newest member of my high council . You know him as a purveyor of mirth and magic . I know him as my loyal ally and new " bud , " Chettus Maximus . ( Crowd cheers ) Oh , my goodness . Not really hurting him . Thank you all . I feel like I finally found a place where I belong . Lovely , lovely . And to say thanks to all of you my bud , Timidius , and I are going to throw a ten-keg beer and ribs blow-out - at the palace this afternoon ! - ( Crowd cheers ) Be there or be flayed alive by the royal torturer . ( Crowd gasps ) I 'm just kidding . Just kidding . I 'm kidding . Like he does . Wonderful . Oh , my , what 's this ? Everyone do this . Churn the butter . You , churn the butter . That 's right , funky fresh . Everyone 's very funky now . Let 's all churn the butter . # ... Get down tonight . # I have a plan to reignite the fury of the masses . Chettus Maximus is the most popular man in the whole of Rome , correct ? - He 's an unstoppable party chariot . - Verily . But ... what if he were to die at Emperor Timidius 's hand ? Then the people would have a reason to hate the emperor again . Chettus would be a martyr and our rebellion would flourish . But how are we going to get the emperor to kill him ? Oh , leave that ... To me . Chettus must die for our cause to live . Remember this moment , brothers . For together , we shall change the course of history . ( Men cheering ) - Knock his block off ! - Oh , my . Oh , my , this new form of combat is quite thrilling , Chettus . Wait till later . I got twister . - Oh , twister , very good . - Master . Your beer bash really is a great success . There 's only one thing missing . You in a tub of hummus wearing a pita bread bikini ? These stimulating magic crystals . The pop rocks ? You must let the emperor try them . He didn 't really go for the atomic fireballs . Oh , trust me . He loves surprises . He 'll go mad over these . ( Crowd cheering ) Oh-oh . ( Squeaky voice ) : Off with his head . ( All cheer ) ( Loud thud ) ( All cheer ) - Hey , Emp . - Hmm ? - Try a mouthful of these . - Oh , very good . ( Fizzing and crackling ) Oh , by the gods , my mouth ! It 's possessed by evil pixies ! Take it easy . It 's just candy . Wash it down with something . ( Groaning and gagging ) It is the plague ! Chettus has poisoned the emperor ! Guards , guards ! Take him ! Bodacious , what are you doing ? No ! This is a mistake ! It 's not the plague ! They 're pop rocks ! - Sire , are you all right ? - Mmm , mmm . Chett . It 's about time . - Now get us out of here . - Me ? No can help . Lisa , one zap special to go . Don 't get me started on that . Eew . Et tu , Chettus ? It was that slutty slave girl . She set me up . Enough lies ! I thought we were friends , Chettus . An emperor doesn 't make very many friends , you know . You think it 's easy for me to make friends ? But you and me , we 're buds . I believe you , Chettus . I believe you are my friend . And friends don 't kill friends , right ? Actually , it 's quite common in Rome . I had to poison my own father to get this job . Centurion , read the prisoners their sentences . " Lisa Curvaceous , Gary Scrawnius and Wyatt Donnely " the penalty for selling counterfeit magic beans ... death . " " Chettus Maximus , the penalty for attempting - to assassinate the emperor ... " - Come on , community service . " Slow death . " Damn . Ya ! Ya ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Easy . Whoa . Whoa . Countrymen ! Chettus Maximus has attempted to assassinate your beloved emperor . Only by the indomitable strength of my mighty warrior 's heart was I able to withstand his poison . They were pop rocks , for crying out loud ! Nice try , Chettus . Let 's get ready to rumble . Yeah ! Ha ! ( Yelling ) Run , you scared little chicken . Run , you bandy-legged little woman . Run away from me . Don 't kill him yet . I 'm rather enjoying this . I 'm all a-tingle . Back , prisoner ! ( Yells ) Run , little white-legged man . Run away from me . Run him down . Crush him . Run him down . I can 't watch . ( Engine sputtering ) ( Engine stops ) Drive ! Drive ! Crush him , you sodden bit of Clay . - Drive this stupid thing . - We cannot , my liege . Oh ! Very well . I suppose we 'll have to do this the old-fashioned way . Release the lions . I don 't know if that 's a good idea ... Do not question , my orders ! Unleash the lions ! Yes , my lord . Unleash the lions . ( Growling ) ( Crowd yelling ) ( Meows ) - ( Crowd laughs ) - ( Cub meows ) Oh ! Cute baby lion . What is this ? Where are my flesh-rending maneaters ? They had a full plate of jaywalkers this morning . We 're trying to train the young ones , help them develop a taste for it . Oh , this day . I suppose we 'll just have to disembowel him . Yes , disembowel him ! LISA : Wait . Why have the others do your killing ? Are you not a mighty warrior ? You boast of crushing the spines of your enemies with your bare hands . Well , I-I ... I don 't crush them so much as just sort of misalign them a bit . Why not smite this peon with one blow of your sword ? Face him in a fair fight . Smite him ! Smite him ! Lisa , hello ? I don 't think this is really helping . Well , I certainly could kill this rapscallion myself . Oh . Uh ... excuse me . You didn 't let me finish . I was going to say whereas I certainly could kill Chettus myself I have decided to show mercy instead and spare his life . That 's okay . I 'll fight you . - ( Crowd yells ) - Not necessary . Quite ... quite unnecessary . It 's spoken like a true warrior , though . True warrior , like myself . But lucky for you , you strange , strange little man . I just don 't have the bloodlust boiling in my veins this afternoon . - I grant Chettus his freedom ! - ( Cheering ) The day 's ... the day 's festivities are far from over . We will continue with the execution of the magic bean felons . - Release the jackals . - ( Gasps ) The lions ate them , sire . Ah . Well , in that case , I sentence them ... To ... Community service . ( Crowd cheering ) Hey . Good thing Chett 's jeep battery had enough juice to zap us back . I just hope we managed to get history back on track . Scampi . Gentlemen , I 'm glad to see you decided to join in the spirit of history week . But " swords and sandals : a celebration of ancient Rome " was yesterday . Was yesterday . Captioned by Grant Brown

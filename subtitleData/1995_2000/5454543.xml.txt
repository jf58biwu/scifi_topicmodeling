Well , I came to say goodbye , Sharpton . And I knew you 'd be here . Like you are every night . Collecting your payoff . Same bat time , same bat channel . I heard that on a re-run . I don 't know what you are talking about . Every night you head out alone , you make your run , collecting your drug money . Then one night you hit a little girl . You couldn 't stop because of all the contrabands you had on board , so you let her to bleed to death . Tell me , what you are going to do about it ? I 'm going to make sure that this is your last run . You got it all down pat don 't ya . Well , you 're right . I do deliver drugs and I do love my money . And I do head out alone . But you left out a little something . What 's that ? The part where I stop and pick up my partner . Come on , we 're going to be late . He 'll freeze to death out here . Yeah . It 's a rough world , ain 't it ? There are pretenders among us I was taken from my family . Thirty-Six Hours , he has already demonstrated more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke up , I spent every moment searching for my past . He is a pretender . A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Center wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and the abused . Life is a gift .

At least for now . Hey , hey , ah , my name 's Argyle by the way . My name 's Argyle . And I 'm called this on account of this birthmark that I got on the back of my thigh . You want to see it ? You want to check it out ? No ? Okay ! That 's cool . Most people don 't . No offence taken . You got a lot of stuff in here , dude . Hey , I hope my patch job keeps in the blood , okay , because look , the dog never complained about the doctoring . But hey , I think you 'd be the better judge you being the real M.D. and all . - Doctor ? - Yeah . You 're a doctor , my friend . This Id here says that your name is Jarod and you , my friend , are a thoracic surgeon . Give me a 3 cc syringe and a size A ET tube . She 's going into respiratory arrest . Prepare to ventilate . Give me the syringe . Remove the plunger . Air entry on both sides of the chest . She 's pinking out . Now that 's a nice sound . Come on . Come on . Yes ! Yeah baby . Now that 's a nice sound . We 're gonna have us some heat now . Oh . Oh . Nothing ever works in this place . Including you . Never ! That 's all going to change . That 's all going to change . Real soon ! I 'm thinking four years of college . I 'm thinking Medical School . I 'm thinking doctoring prescriptions . You know , I 've been riding a wooden pony for years now . And I 'm thinking , you might just be my brass ring . Brass Ring ? Pot of gold , boy , ship that 's come in . The way out man . I 'm thinking the hospital 'll pay a healthy finders fee for one of it prize physicians . Not a doctor . You 're not a doctor ? Come on . Who , the hell , are you then ? I don 't know . What is this ? It 's a T-board . A what ? What ? T standing for torture . The Centre Tribunal . They want answers and until they get them we 're not going anywhere . Well , no . You 're kidding right ? Don 't soil yourself , Broots . They want us unbalanced . That 's why they yanked us in the dead of night . They 're trying to fracture us emotionally . Well , it 's working . I 'm shattering . How do you know so much about this ? I 've been on the other side of the glass . So how does it turn out ? Fine . If you 're on the other side of the glass . Oh great ! I knew Raines would be involved . The question is who 's behind it all . The Triumvirate , cruskin . Under whose authority ? Bridget ! That bitch is like a bad cough . Who are those guys in the shadows ? I don 't know . I need to get word to my father . Here . I 'm not sure that he will be able to help . Sydney ! Hello lovey ! Bridget . The last time I saw you , you were trying to blow my father 's helicopter out of the sky . How did you get back in the Centre ? Well , before we get to that , I promised some friends of mine I 'd find out why after eighteen months , Jarod is still out there . Not possible . They created him . They know what he 's capable of . Yes , they do . They think , the only way that he could still be eluding the Center is that one , or all of you , are working with him . They think that ? Or you made them think that ? Either way , no one 's leaving until we find out who . We start with you , Tex . Whoever you are , you 've got a tooth sweeter than mine , that 's for sure . Sugar 's a killer , you know that ? It will rot all the teeth out , right out of your head . I 'm lucky . I 'm blessed . I 've really good teeth . They 're all mine . Hey , buddy ? What 's wrong ? Oh no . You don 't know who you are and you 're burning up . That 's what happens when you 're left out in the elements . That 's what happens . Your problem was you weren 't looking over your shoulder . You always gotta look over your shoulder , man . There 's always somebody back there in the dark , Some mook , some punk back there gunning for you , I know . You gotta look over your shoulder , man . Look over your shoulder . Or maybe you 're running away from this cutie pie . Who 's this ? Hey Who 's this pretty lady ? What did she do ? Bust your rocks for not bringing home the green . Hey , you didn 't bring home the green . Maybe she 's another doctor . You know , you 'd better think twice about that next time . Well , I 'll be John Brown . I will be John Browned . You 're not a doctor . You 're a park ranger . No , you 're a fireman . No , you 're a roach exterminator . No , you 're a federal investigator . I 'm , I 'm sorry , mister . Could you help me out here for a second ? I 'm kind of at a loss here . Who the hell are you ? Mister ? Mister ? I don 't know who I am . I didn 't do anything . Broots scared . How do you think he will hold up ? Before or after he wets his pants ? Can I , Can I have a robe ? Is Jarod smarter than you ? - Huh ? - You 've been chasing him for over a year . Has he alluded you because he is smarter ? No . We try hard every day to find Jarod but the wheel of fortune just hasn 't landed on our number yet . Spinning , spinning , spinning . Well , he is a Pretender . He 's a one-man Siegfried and Roy . Show me what you have . Jarod interconnected 173 international calls . But backtracking those calls was impossible because instead of a call forwarding device triggered by a single call all one hundred and seventy-three calls was individually initiated . - Ingenious . - And very expensive . I don 't care what it cost . Oh , that 's good because Jarod charged them all to your calling card . He 's , he 's clever and smart . Which makes tracking Jarod more fun . Fun ? No ! I ... Are you saying he 's your hero ? No . I 'm ... No , I 'm not saying that . Then what are you saying ? Just ... I 'm just saying that Jarod 's clever . You can see it in his eyes . You can tell . According to your file you 've never laid eyes on Jarod . You never have , have you ? No . I , ah , I 'm referring to pictures . Hello , Mr Broots . Oh , my God ! Help me , please . Eighteen months , no results . We find it hard to believe that someone could be this inept on purpose . Help me ... Mr Broots ! If you 're not helping Jarod then who is ? Can I have a robe please ? You 're like you and me . Bunch of names . Travel light . Man on the run . Who are you running from anyway ? John Law . The man with a smile on his face and the evil in his heart ? Huh ? Who you running from ? Hey . Maybe you got a bounty on your head ? Your head 's burning up . You 're burning up , man . Oh no . This is not good . You 've been out in the elements too long man . Out in the elements too long . I knew it . This is not good . I knew it . This is bad . Jarod ! Jarod ! I love you , Jarod . Don 't leave me . Please don 't leave me . Come on ! Hey ! Hey ! Are you okay , man ? Are you okay ? No ! No ! No , don 't you die on me , man . Don 't you die on me ! Don 't you leave me ! You 're my brass ring man ! Come on ! Don 't you die on me , man ! Don 't you die on me , man ! I know the escape procedure . The fire ! It 's too hot ! It comes into the airline . I try not to breathe but it is too late . I can 't open the hatch . I can 't open the hatch ! No one can get to us . We can 't be saved . I 'm burning ! I 'm burning ! I 'm burning ! I 'm burning ! Hey ! Your fever broke . Doubt left you with me for a while . So , what 's the Centre ? Your your little freakish home movies are all labelled " For Centre Use Only . " What 's the Centre ? I don 't know . You don 't know ! I ... I 'll tell you what I think , Jarod . I think that you got a big brain . And I think that these Centre guys , I think they 're after you . And I think that means you 're worth something to them , which means you 're worth a lot to me . You see I got a big brain too . Jarod , I got a big brain too . Why won 't you work ? Why won 't you work ? Why won 't you work ? I 'm just trying to fix things , Jarod . I 'm just trying to make them right . Not a big deal . No big deal . Just trying to fix things . Who are you ? The proudest woman in the world . Who am I ? Just trust your feelings . Always trust your feelings . Jarod , I told you I can 't accept this . But I made it for you . This card is meant for someone else . Don 't you love me , Sydney ? We have work to do . Is Sydney your dad or something ? I 'm so glad I left Debbie at her god mother 's . I can 't believe how long they 've had Sydney out there . You wear a watch to bed ? Yeah . Why ? In case I wake up and , you know , need to document something . Let us continue . When are they going to leave him alone ? When they hear what they want to hear . He 's been out there for six hours already . And they 'll take another six if they want to . What are they doing this for ? Because they can . Jarod is my life 's work . My interest in him is primarily scientific . That interest demands that I remain objective which precludes the possibility of guilt . Don 't you love me , Sydney ? Forgive me father for I have sinned . I have betrayed a friend . Have you prayed to the Lord ? Not even he can forgive me for what I have done . The bond between Jarod and me is as unique as Jarod is special . Unique enough for you to be fighting for his freedom . I would never do that . Jarod 's a very complex case . I 've tried to keep him alive and to hold his psyche in check during this pursuit . What are you ? His wet nurse ? We must be patient . Your tactics are far too aggressive . The day you really anger Jarod is the day that he will disappear forever . I have tried to bring him back . That is my objective . As a scientist , I think The Centre is as good a place as he will find to maximise his tremendous potential . You don 't know who Jarod is . You 're not a doctor . You 're a park ranger . No , you 're a fireman . No , you 're a roach exterminator . No , a federal investigator . I 'm sorry , mister . Who the hell are you ... - How are you ? - I can be anything I want to be . I can be a doctor , I can be an engineer , I can be an astronaut . But I don 't know who I am . Our father gave you this . Who the hell are you ? I 'm your brother . Jarod , go and find our parents . I want to know what I look like . I want to know who I am . I 'm not really a plastic surgeon . My name is Jarod . I 'm not really a doctor . Jarod Jones . I 'm not really in the Coast Guard . Jarod Kent . Jarod O 'Leary . Jarod Wright . Who the hell are you ? Well , I sure as hell aren 't Florence Nightingale . This is who you look like . This is who you are ... You 're my son . You 're my life . I love you , Jarod . Then one night you hit a little girl . Jarod . Hi , Jarod . Hello ? Hello . My name is Argyle . A.R.G.Y.L.E. Um ? Is this the Centre ? Maybe . Why ? I don 't know . Maybe I 've got something you want . Uh huh ! Well , I 'm all ears . Dog here , he 's a hero . See I rescued him from the pond . And he saved you . He saved you , I saved him . It 's ironic . It 's ironic . Yeah ? When did I go from patient to prisoner ? Prisoner . Prisoner . Prisoner ! That 's cold man . That 's cold . What would you call it ? What would I call it ? What would I call it ? I , I call it ironic . I call it ironic . I call it ironic . Just slip into my skin for a second , would you ? Just for a second , slip into my skin . A wigged out stewardess , gets a hangnail . Kills the entire flight crew . Three hundred people drop out of the clouds . Boom ! A postman goes postal . Bang ! A Bus driver goes bustal . Crash ! And we , we all sit idly by and say ¡ ° You are crazy man . Crazy . That was so crazy . I 'm glad it wasn 't me . ¡ ± The point is you 've been sprouting crazy here a while now . And I 'm just making sure that 's not me . Okay . Fair 's fair . And by the way , I 'm not into hurting you either . So you can rack easy on that bro . Hey , I wish we had a deck of cards because I got this great trick I could show you . Is that my phone ? Yeah . Who 'd you call ? Yeah ! I just called the doctor . I called your doctor to see if he made house calls .. You called Sydney ? No . No . No . He wasn 't there but a lady answered . - Miss Parker ? - No . No . No . No . It 's Bridget . - She sounded sexy . - Did you tell them where you are ? What ? Do I look like a road sign ? Listen to me . These people . This organisation . They will kill you . Trust me . Trust you ? No , you listen to me . Trust . Trust . Great word . Right ? Trust . It 's on every coin , every bill , every buck , every bond in this country . And yet it 's still the one thing you still can 't buy . Argyle ! They are setting you up ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Bridget said you 'd have an answer for everything and you do . Don 't ruin everything . It 's good here . It 's good . It 's good . Three hours ago you didn 't know whether you were park ranger or rodeo clown . Now you 're cracking foxy about some secret organisation that wants to hurt me . It 's you they want , my friend . It 's you . I just happen to hold the deed . You listen to me . I speak from experience . You 're dealing with the devil . Thank you for joining us , Miss Parker . Well , it was an invitation that I simply couldn 't pass up . Lose the butt . You don 't have to worry about me blowing smoke . Put it out ! This is cruel . Even for a T-Board . Fire away , babe . I 'm not going anywhere . The Triumvirate is a bit murky concerning your motives in the pursuit of Jarod . Well . Maybe they should pull their heads out of their sand boxes . I do my job . Period ! What we are looking for is the truth . Truth ? That is a very interesting word coming from you . So you have no other agenda in doing your job . No unresolved issues or conflicts with the Centre or Jarod . I have no unresolved issues with the Centre . Is that the truth ? I know the truth , Miss Parker . And what truth is that , Jarod ? The truth about what makes you sad . Daddy , I want to know what really happened to my Mum . I have no unresolved issues with the Centre . You didn 't answer about Jarod . Where did you find my mother 's ring . In one of your mother 's safe deposit boxes . Like her medical file . Oh , you 'd be surprised what one can find in there . Jarod ! You know the dance , Miss Parker . You help me with one of my secrets , I help you with one of yours . We weren 't able to find anything about Igor or Fenigor . I don 't know if he was my mother 's allier or betrayer . Well , keep searching . Igor holds the secret to both our pasts . What makes you so sure ? Call it a gut feeling . So you 're saying that in your past year and a half pursuit he 's not had any undue influence on you ? That 's what I 'm saying . Not of any kind ? No influence at all ! Not even emotional ? They say it 's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all . Do you believe that 's true ? You paint a pretty sad picture . How do we end up like this ? Like what ? Alone . Searching . It 's ironic because we both want the same things . Someone to care about someone to care about us . Do you think we 'll ever find that kind of love in our lifes ? How do we end up like this ? ... Miss Parker ? Miss Parker ? Hi ! We 're done here . Miss Parker . You may have a cigarette now . I just quit . Mr. Argyle . You know Bridget . If your body is half as good as your brain you and I might just find a way , you know . Coming from a man of your brilliance that 's quite a compliment . Hey , by the way you hit it right on the nail indeed about cashew boy here . He 's a nut , alright ? Yes . He 's crazy . But he 's resourceful ! So have you come up with a price ? Bridget . If this is about Jarod ... Shhh . I 'm on the phone . You know , I was out scamming this softie suburbanite the other day out of his lunch money when I saw this dapper Dan in a Rolls Royce . A Rolls Royce , Huh ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ! Real , real shiny ! Anyway , this guy right , he gets out of the car , and I find myself staring at his threads , right . I 'm staring at this cat 's threads and I 'm thinking to myself I don 't know the dude from the president of England . I don 't know if he 's a liar , if he kicks his dog , if he smacks his old lady , nothing . And yet , I find myself having this instant , incredible respect for the guy on account of the suit he 's wearing . Ah hah ! Go On . Yeah ! His suit , his shirt , his watch , his loafers , the whole kit and caboodle . One piece more expensive than the next . Silk on silk . Leather on leather . And you know , I 'm thinking to myself , Bridget , I 'm thinking to myself , to drape this guy it must have cost at least , I don 't know , at least ten thousand dollars , Bridget . Is that the price of respect , Mr Argyle ? Hey ! Hey , a man ain 't squat without respect . Well , ten thousand dollars is a great deal of money but I think I can convince my people to approve it . No ! No ! Big brain . Don 't do this . Bridget ? Write this down . That 's just three hours away . I 'm on the next plane . If you 've found , Jarod I am the only one who can bring him in . Sorry darling . This time he comes in . Hey ! Hey ! It 's all for the best . You 're going back where you belong . I 'm getting out of here . It 'll all be fine . Trust me . Trust me ! This sucks ! Why are they making us just sit here and wait . So when wonder woman brings him in it will prove the point we didn 't because one of us was helping him . Leaving us as good as dead , huh ? I never thought that I 'd be rooting for Jarod . I didn 't mean that . I didn 't mean that ! Daddy ! Angel . Oh , I came as soon as I found out . How dare they put my daughter through a T-Board . - Are you alright ? - For now . You 'll all be out of here after I lop off a few heads . Daddy , be careful . Right . Boy , I never thought I 'd be glad to see your old man . Yeah , I 'm glad he 's here too , Broots . Unfortunately , there 's reason to believe he 's been here the whole time . I 'm sorry , Parker . He 's done it again . Mr. Argyle ? Bridget ? - Nice to see you . - Nice to see you ! Get the case out of the trunk , Willie . Yes . You 've got something for me in the trunk , Willie ? I bring you respect in a bag . Oh wow . Ten thousand real ones . Where 's Jarod ? He 's in the basement , in the boiler room . Hey ! Willie , when you see I 've Jarod , put a bullet in his brain , if you can find it . My pleasure . What are you talking about " bullet in my brain " ? That 's not nice ! Hey , hey . Damn ! Well , if it isn 't sleeping beauty . And they said you were so hard to catch . Time to rise and shine . Wake up , my little love muffin . Come on , baby , wake Up ! Wake up . Hi . Time to go home . Sorry . But I 'm never going back there . You 're not so mean . Nice to see you again , Willie . Hi ! Your brass ring . I knew you were the one to trust right from the start . On second thought . I think I 'll donate it to the pond . In dog 's name . Like you said , he 's the hero . Give me back my pez . Bridget ? Nope ! Sorry ! It 's just Jarod . But you can come and pick up your blonde now . Sweet dreams , love . She blew it , didn 't she ? - Jarod ? - Alive , still free ! So are you . Thanks for the robe . Give ne a lift ? To where , daddy ? Another dead end . - What are you talking about ? - Don 't you dare ! You set me up , for a T-Board ? I was wondering how long it would take you to figure that out . Come on . You really don 't think I could fool you . You 're a Parker . I 'd be stupid to even try . Besides these damn shoes are killing me . If this is true , then why would you ally with Bridget ? Bridget cut a deal with the Triumvirate . Your butt for hers . I had to go along with her to get rid of her for good . Action , reaction . Give and take . It 's not about who knows what It 's about who thinks they know what and what you want them to think . - I ... - To keep the hungry dogs away you must toss them a bone now and then . Is that what I am ? A bone ? You 're my legacy and you proved it again today . Never forget that . It 'll keep you alive . Trust me . You should find something you can trust . And you trust me . Trust me . How can you still trust him ? Trust him ? Will you be alright , Miss Parker ? Of course . Let 's get out of here . Let 's go . Let 's go . Sydney , do you think that someone in the Centre is really helping Jarod ? In the Centre ? Anything 's possible . We 're still searching for him and we 'll find the leak . Did you uncover something that can help us find Jarod , Angelo ? Keep working . Keep working . See you tomorrow , same bat time same bat channel . You remember me ? You don 't learn so easy , do you , pal ? Maybe not . But I never make the same mistake twice . Who the hell are you ? I 'm many people . But tonight I 'm a truck driver .

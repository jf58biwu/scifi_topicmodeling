 You make man ? No . Woman . FRANKENSTEIN : Woman ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine , diagrams charts . Mending broken and making weird science . Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . My creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold . Just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . My creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand ? Alive , alive . Career choices . High school will one day end and you 'll have to face the real world . What to do with your lives then ? I don 't know . I was thinking maybe grab some burgers . I have some errands to run . To help you answer this big question , here 's your assignment . For the next week you will work with one of your parents every day after school and write a report on your experience . [ GROANING ] What is it , Wallace ? No biggie , but hypothetically , what if we 'd rather lick a hot muffler ? Then hypothetically , you 'll fail . Oh . I 'm on board . Come on . Get the lead out . I don 't want to spend the whole day here . HARRY ( OVER RADIO ) : Al . You there ? Go ahead , Harry . HARRY ( OVER RADIO ) : You got a three banger on the 105 off ramp . She 's all yours , captain . I 'm there . Hey , hey , you hear that ? The big guy upstairs has blessed us with a three car pileup . Oh . That 's wonderful news . Look . It may not sound like much , but it 's honest work . It buys you food , clothing , and that goop you put in your hair . A three banger . We 're eating steak tonight . [ ENGINE BLOWING ] No . Not now of all the freaking days . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] That 's should do it , Mr. Donnelly . I also installed Wing Commander for you . Thanks . If there 's nothing else , I 'll send the executive chef up to take your lunch orders . Great . So , Wyatt , what do you think of the advertising game so far ? Oh , a little rough , but I 'll get used to it . Hey . I 'm sorry , sir . He slipped in while I was on the phone . That 's OK , Cheryl . Hey , Gar . How 's it going ? You want a fizzy water ? No thanks . The guy down at the garage let me drink off the hose . So how 's life in the emergency lane ? Oh , pretty much like this . Except it sucks and I smell like roadkill . Wayne . Got a sec ? This is my boss , Mr. Tate . Barry , have you met my son ? Yes , we ran into each other in the executive washroom . By the way , did you get that jiggle fixed yet ? - Excuse me ? - The jiggle . Stall three . We 're not getting a good flush . You are the toilet repairman , aren 't you ? Oh , no . This is my friend Gary Wallace . Gray , Mr. Tate . Axle grease . Ah . Wayne , Joanna Moulton 's been called out of town unexpectedly , so I want you to take over the Air Wave Sneakers presentation tomorrow morning . I 'd love to . Thank you , Barry . I 'm not kidding you here . This could be your chance to step into the creative director shoes . We 're looking for a home run here . Well , I 'm your designated hitter . Good . Wyatt , let 's have lunch sometime . Talk advertising . Sounds good , sir . Don 't forget . Stall three . I 'll get right on it . Yes , yes , yes . The Air Wave sneaker campaign . My lucky suit scores again . Lucky suit ? Good things happen when I wear this suit . It never fails . My first job . That stock tip back in ' 85 . Conceiving you . ( TOGETHER ) Ew . Come on , fellas . Let 's celebrate . Hard day at the office ? For some of us . I had a hard day too , thanks . Why ? You sprain your wrist on the bottled water . Or did your secretary forget to crumble goat cheese on your salad ? It wasn 't all of that . This assignment bites . Come on , Gary . You must be learning something from all this . Oh , sure . Here 's a little factoid . Did you know that a car battery explodes in a shower of hot acid if you charge it backwards ? Your dad 's job isn 't all bad . He gets to be outside on the open road , helping people in trouble . Great . You wanna swap ? Hell no . See ? It 's a gyp . My dad struggles all his life while Wayne Donnelly straps on a lucky suit and rockets right to the top . You really think the suit is lucky ? Why not ? I believe in genies . If my dad had that suit in his closet , he 'd have a big house and a puff cake job too . That 's ridiculous . People make their own luck . My dad is successful because he 's good . Not because of some lucky tweed . Fine . Let my dad borrow the suit . I 'll prove it to you . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Why do I gotta wear this thing ? It doesn 't even fit . You 're asking for a bank loan to fix the truck . You can 't go in there looking like Mr. Green Jeans . Besides , I have you feeling things will really start happening for you in this suit . Oh , things are happening already . I get some kind of rash brewing . Feel like a monkey , for crying out loud . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Boy , you should be wearing safety goggles . If his buttons go , you could lose an eye . Look , I need a favor . Could you zap the suit and make it lucky ? You said it already was lucky . Well , I just want to prove to Wyatt that if my dad had the same breaks , he 'd be successful too . But if I zap the suit , that would be cheating . I didn 't say I wanted to prove anything to myself . You 'd be completely despicable if you weren 't so much fun . [ ZAPPING ] Hey . What do you know ? This thing 's got some give after all . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Dad , you look great . Like a real grown up . You know what I mean . Like an adult . I am an adult . Look , a quarter . Dibs . [ HONKING ] Excuse me , sir ? Do you want to buy this car for a quarter ? Are you kidding me ? The judge said I had to sell it and give half the money to my ex . He didn 't say how much I had to sell it for . What do you say ? Sold . I can 't believe this is happening to me . I guess this is your lucky day . COP : Stop him . [ THUD ] You just call the Pomona Prowler . Dad . You 're a hero . [ APPLAUSE ] Somebody get this man 's name so we can send him his reward . How about that ? A brand new Mercedes , big fat reward . Nothing could make this day more perfect . [ HONKING ] Meister Brau . I stand corrected . I hate being without my lucky suit . I just don 't understand this . Why would your mother have taken it to the cleaners ? Beats me . But what are you worried about ? Your great at your job . You don 't need some stupid suit to impress people . You do that naturally . Thanks , Wyatt . Maybe I could manage one presentation without it , huh ? Give ' em hell , Dad . Whoops . [ RIPPING ] Oh , no . [ BUZZER ] Yes ? CHERYL ( ON INTERCOM ) : Mr. Donnelly , they 're waiting for you . Yes , I 'd better get to that presentation . You know , the one thing- - perfect . What are you doing ? Taking the tie off . This monkey suit is starting to get old . No , you can 't take it off . It might jinx you . Think about it . You put this suit on , lucky things happen . It 's like a full body rabbit 's foot . I am feeling pretty lucky . [ SCREECHING ] [ THUD ] MALE SPEAKER : Sorry again about the fender bender , Al . Coffee ? Al Wallace ? What the hell are you doing here ? Just lucky , I guess . Mr. Tate . I was terribly worried about you . Sorry , fender bender . My mind wandered at an intersection . I plowed into poor Al here . Mans a prince . Got me a free toy , gave me a ride to work . I thought I 'd give him the nickel tour . So what do you guys make here ? Um , advertising , Al . We make advertising . Oh , heya , Wayne . Let 's hear what you 've got . See if you can make me forget I just totaled my car . Oh , uh . Right . Sure thing , Barry . Upon analyzing the specs for Air Wave Sneakers- - Slogan . Get to the slogan . Of course . Air Wave Sneakers . They 'll make you run like a Greyhound . I don 't find that funny , Donnelly . My dog , Rex , passed away this morning . And he was a Greyhound ? No . He was hit by one . [ LAUGHTER ] I get it . Hit by one . He means the bus . Al , he 's not joking . Sure I am . Looks like you and I are the only ones around here with a sense of humor . [ LAUGHTER ] I gotta tell you guys . I really love those Air Wave Sneakers . They make you feel like you 're running around with a couple of big squishy pillows strapped to your feet . Kind of . It 's brilliant . That 's our slogan right there . What slogan ? Air Wave Sneakers . They make you feel like you 're running around with a couple of big squishy pillows strapped to your feet . Kind of . [ APPLAUSE ] I 'm in complete agreement with you , sir . That is an excellent slogan . Bravo . And might I add , you have a remarkable memory . Al , how 'd you like a job ? I already got a job . Dad . You gotta take it . I won 't take no for an answer , Mr. Creative Director . Actually , that 's Mr. Wallace . [ LAUGHTER ] Scanning , scanning . What do we got ? Woofer . Woofer . Whoa . Sensors locked on target . There she is again . Four days in a row . No boyfriend in sight . This is it . I 'm making my move . Hi . I was wondering if you 'd like to go out with me . I 'm a doctor . OK . OK , what ? OK . I 'll go out with you . I 'm not a doctor . It doesn 't matter . But I just lied to you . It doesn 't matter . Listen , I live with my parents . I have no job . No prospects for a job . No interest in finding a job . And I 've never been in a relationship that lasted longer than a Tic Tac . I 'll still go out with you . What 's wrong with you ? My boyfriend just dumped me . My self-esteem is in the toilet and I have lost my will to live . At this point , I 'd date an area rug . I got you covered . Woohoo . I always wanted a chair that would do this . Dad . You 're an executive now . Nonsense . Whatever makes Al happy makes Mr. Tate happy . That 's what flies around here . Excellent work with that slogan . You 're going places , Al . I 'd just like to be your copilot on your rocket to the top , if you 'll have me . Sure , whatever . Fine . I 'll just leave you to settle in , captain . [ LAUGHTER ] Boy , is that guy a phony butt smoocher or what ? [ PHONE RINGING ] Yello ? MAN ( ON PHONE ) : This is KOPC . If you can name the phrase that pays , you 'll win a free trip to Cancun . Kiss my rusty butt . MAN ( ON PHONE ) : That 's it . You won . Ugh . Boy , I 've been getting these crank calls all morning . You 've won this , you 've won that . What ? Do they think I 'm a moron ? No dad . Why would they think you 're a moron ? The good news is you 're finally getting the breaks you deserve . Breaks schmeaks . I 'm no creative director . I should get back to the truck . You 've got to give this a chance . Don 't you want to set a good example ? Well , I thought I already did . I own my own business . But this is a good example with perks . Major perks . Well , if it 's that important to you . What are you doing ? Airing out my dogs . Ahh . [ BUZZER ] Yo ? CHERYL ( ON INTERCOM ) : Mr. Wallace ? I have Ed McMahon on Lin line two . Something about a sweepstakes . Oh , yes . And I 'm Johnny frigging Carson . Tell that crank to get lost . Ah . If you 'll excuse me , I 'll be in the library . [ ZAPPING ] Phew . What died in here ? It 's , uh , my dad 's socks . Does the suit still work without them ? Like it came with a manual . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Nice office . My dad used to love it . It 's nothing compared to his new one , though . Coming through . [ TOILET FLUSHING ] They demoted your dad ? And replaced him with your dad . Well , you were the one who gave away his lucky suit . There 's no such thing as luck . Unless somebody makes it luck real . Now who do we know that could do that ? Whoops . Gotta motor . You let her zap the suit , didn 't you ? So what if I did ? I want it back right now . We made a deal . You said I could borrow it for a week . It 's only been a day . - Tough . My dad needs it . Oh , your dad who doesn 't need any luck because he 's so wildly talented ? Uh uh . My wish , my dad , my suit . You 'll get back Tuesday . Tuesday ? Tuesday . I 'm off to the executive dining room for a kiwi slushie . You can join me if you like . [ SNIFFING ] Man . What died in here ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ] I think I just got lucky . Dad . I think I have something that might cheer you up . Tada . They 're socks . Lucky socks from your lucky suit . I need more than socks to help me . Come on . You gotta fight . I appreciate what you 're trying to do , Wyatt . But face it . I 've lost my edge . No . You 've lost your confidence . Take the socks . Trust the socks . Ignore the smell . Thanks . I needed a fresh pair . I got a date tonight . Get your own . Those are dad 's . Yep . I met a girl . Her name is Angie . She 's perfect . She looks great . She smells great . She 's clinically depressed . And she wants me . Just take the socks . [ SNIFFING ] Did Mom switch fabric softeners ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ CAR ACCIDENT OUTSIDE ] [ MEN ARGUING ] Excuse me . Uh , Mr. Wallace . I 'm , uh , here to work on your phone . Sure . Why not . That 's quite a stack you got there . Yeah . Somebody around here must think the old fake check gag is a real riot , huh ? Uh , go ahead . Phone 's right there . So what 's a big powerful executive like you got to be so sad about ? I used to drive a towing rig . I miss it . The open road , country music on the radio , smell of gas in your hair . Well , if you miss your old job , why are you here ? Well , it 's important my son . He thinks I 'm making something of myself . But- - But I feel stupid in a suit . The only time I ever wore one was the day I married my wife , Emily . And those two days on People 's Court . Oh , I got a presentation tomorrow . I don 't even know the first thing about what sells shoes . Hmm . Relax , Al . I know what sells shoes . What phone company did you say you were from ? [ GRUNTING ] I 'm bored . Maybe this was a mistake . I 'm gonna leave . You can 't go . I 'm only on first base . I have needs . All right . You want a little more ? I 'm thinking of a number between 1 and 3 million . Give me a break . 466,823 ? OK . Now I 'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10 million . 7 . That 's incredible . OK . Wait . What was my second grade art teacher 's maiden name ? Plumber . Damn . OK . Now I 'm making up a word . Schnarfulpupper . OK . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Since my dad 's doing so well with the company , I thought we could discuss future employment . After all , I won 't be in high school forever . [ LAUGHTER ] I hate to burst your bubble , kid , but it takes at least a Harvard education to land a position with Block and Associates , provided there 's an opening in the mail room . [ LAUGHTER ] Nonsense , Phil . We 'd be lucky to land Gary . Gary comes from good stock . If Gary has half the talent his father has , you 'll be kissing his butt in a few years . Or you could start sucking up now , Phil . Avoid the rush . [ LAUGHTER ] He 's as quick as his father , sir . Welcome to the team . Let me freshen your Yoohoo . Excuse me . What are you doing here ? Helping your dad . With what ? Dad , where 's the suit ? Right here . If I 'm going to do this job , I 'm going to do it my way . Besides my idea is going to blow them out of the water . Go get ' em , Dad . We 're doomed . - Wallace . Nice touch . Dress down day . Shall we get started ? First of all , say hello to our new Air Wave Sneakers girl . Lisa , would you come up here ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ APPLAUSE ] [ INAUDIBLE ] . Hey . [ WHISTLE ] Now I 'm thinking in big , black letters we 'll see Air Wave Sneakers makes you feel like you 're running around with a couple of big squishy pillows strapped to your feet , kind of . And then , this is where Lisa comes in . Where are you ? Those are my feet . Wallace , you mean to tell me we hired this gorgeous , sexy woman and all you use are her feet ? Excuse me , Perry . But sex doesn 't sell footwear . Feet sell footwear . I 'm afraid I have to disagree . You have something to add , Donnelly . Dad . Here 's you lucky suit . No . I don 't need luck . I 've got four years of college , a master 's degree , and 25 years of experience in this business . We need to see her breasts . Huh ? I like where this is going . Let 's hear him out . First lose the slogan . It stinks . No offense , Wallace . But it 's got too many words . Consumers don 't like to read . Simple . To the point . But I 'm not sold yet . Of course you 're not . By itself it 's invisible . It 's got no life . That 's where the sex comes in . Lisa , could you please come here and read this . Air Wave Sneakers make you feel like running . Yes . I like it . [ APPLAUSE ] Dad . Do something . He 's stealing all your thunder . This is your campaign . I don 't know . I like his better . Wallace , I 'm putting Donnelly back on the campaign . Wayne . I apologize . I should have trusted your experience . All , right Dad . Yes . Mr. Tate . We 've got other ideas . Just listen . Hey , are those Air Waves ? I want to make out with you . Or Air Wave Sneakers . Like having lots of thick puffy skin wrapped around your feet . Bill . Or Air Sneakers , it 's like- - Gary . Gary . It 's OK . I don 't want this job anyway . It 's not me . I just tried it because I thought you were ashamed of your old man for being a tow truck driver . No . I wasn 't ashamed . I just thought you needed a few lucky breaks in life . Like this job . Well , I did get lucky breaks . I got my own rig , my own house , your mother . But you know what the most important thing we have is ? Each other ? No , I was thinking about the Mercedes and the 400 cans of beer . [ LAUGHTER ] OK , Dad . [ LAUGHTER ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ HONKING ] The Meister Brau express . Right on schedule . This is my lucky day . [ ZAPPING ] Uh oh . [ HONKING ] I stand corrected . THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips . Shooting from the hip . Something different will make it weird science . Pictures from a magazine . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand my intentions ?

 Let 's go . I never realized these underground passages were here . Yeah . Hey is it true ... Is it true there 's treasure here ? I heard it from the former warden , so it has to be true . There 's a spectacular treasure hidden here . Hey , is this it ? Definitely . Do it . Yeah . What the ... It 's human ! L-It can 't be ! What 's going on ? T-There 's no treasure ? It 's still alive ! What the hell are you ? Who am I ? Who in the world am I ? K-Kill me ... Please , kill me ! Even if you are a criminal , we must respect your life . What are you ? What the hell are you , anyway ? My name is Michael ... The one who keeps law and order . From this border on , this is Jesus Town . Please , present entrance permission visa . I repeat . Please , present entrance permission visa . Hey , stop ! Come back here ! It 's tonight . Wait at the rendezvous point . Let 's go . An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate . An unknown intruder has broken through the main gate . Hey , time to move . Go ! Go ! Warning . Do not move . You are now under our jurisdiction . Repeat . Warning . Do not move . If you do not obey ... Can you hear it ? The sound of the people 's joy . Today we celebrate the third anniversary of Jesus Town . People call Jesus Town a place of miracles . Here there is love and peace above what has ever been achieved before . There is still poverty and confusion everywhere beyond this place . We are actually living in a modern Eden . Is anything wrong ? I am moved . Look ... This orchid was dying until yesterday , but today it is fully blooming . Even a tiny flower like this has a life . Reporting , Sir . Someone has broken the border gate and invaded Jesus Town . I have no choice . Call in the heavy soldiers . I want to protect everyone in Jesus Town . That includes the smallest life . You are justice and I am the servant of justice . That dream again . Hey , Kaoru ! You okay ? Kaoru ! Hey ! Let 's go ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Let 's go ! Get ready ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Come on ! All right , run ! H-Help ! Hurry ! That way ! This way ! Not good . Parliament 's heavy soldiers ! What are we going to do , Kaoru ? Run ! Run ! What is that ? That 's ... Y-You bastard , do you have any idea what you 're doing ? Do you have any idea ? Do you understand ? P-Please , spare me ! I was just following orders ! If you don 't have a will of your own , there is no reason for you to live . Transmitting images of intruder . T-That 's Hakaider . Hurry ! Die ! Kaoru ! Master Michael ! Why didn 't you die ? If you truly deserve to be one of my men you would have fought and died . You shouldn 't move yet . Relax , we 're all friends trying to rebel against the government . This hideout isn 't going to be found easily . Want some food ? A robot doesn 't need any food . Whoever heard of a robot that eats bread or soup ? Hey , don 't tell me it 's love at first sight ! You sleazy robot . Say , would you do us a favor ? We need your help . Our country is controlled by Parliament right now . We have to destroy it ! He 's a weird robot . Maybe a nutcase . However you look at it , it 's not human . We can 't let it stay here . Yeah ! I ain 't trusting no robot . What if he breaks down and goes out of control ? Shut up ! I know . Hey , you came to save this country , didn 't you ? Then fight with us ! We have to get Gurjev of Parliament ! He talks of sweet things like love and peace , but what he 's really doing is ... Please , help ! Please , stop ! Get moving . Quit messing around ! Anyone who shows the possibility of disobeying Gurjev will be caught . Stop , please ! Kill me ! No ! No ! No ! And they insert a chip into the brain to erase all human emotions . Tears , laughter , and anger ... To Gurjev , emotions only get in the way . Look . Now he will be reborn . In this country , no crime is allowed to occur . Any criminal ... Any disobedient civilian will be given a new life by me . Beautiful . Just like children . I am their father . I must protect them with my own hands . From any threat . Such as Hakaider . Do you know that thing ? The true identity of that robot ? I had him made . Before your birth , we needed a lethal robot to protect the order of this country . However , the Hakaider Operation failed . We could not control him . And just before he was to be destroyed some scientists stole Hakaider and disappeared . He is sort of a ghost . He doesn 't really exist . Hakaider only kills . Only destroys . He will bring chaos to my order ! We must eliminate Hakaider , no matter what ! Please , leave it to me . I am superior . Even to Hakaider . What Gurjev means by order is to take everybody 's freedom away ! If you resist him , he 'll rearrange the inside of your head ! He 'll take your soul away . Peace in this country is fictitious . Everybody 's always under surveillance and lives in fear . Look for this man , Hakaider . He 's a dangerous individual and a threat to our peaceful country . Search for Hakaider ! Please , fight with us to destroy Parliament . ... to save this country . That 's right ! If we destroy Parliament , we 'll be the new leaders ! Then we 'll control everything ! Let 's live large ! Don 't get the wrong idea ! These are precious funds ! It 's not your allowance ! Don 't be so square . We just wanna have some fun sometimes . Right ? Idiot ! You 're slacking off too much . I have a dream of starting a ranch someday . So I 'd better start saving . A ranch ? You guys ... Calm down . Being uptight is one of your weaknesses . Everyone has dreams . Don 't you , Kaoru ? You 're not gonna to say , " to be an ordinary bride , " are you ? Anyhow , after destroying Parliament , any dream can come true . Because we 'll be the law then . You are the same ! You bastard ! What are you doing ? You damned robot ! Just like Parliament , you are all ugly . Bastard ! Arnie ! Kaoru ... Hey ! Kaoru ... You assholes ! You killed him ... You killed him ... Our only hope ... You ... The invading artificial being has been destroyed . You killed him ... You killed him ... Our only hope ... You 're the same ! You don 't fight . You just look the other way . You killed him ... You ... Go to hell ! Hey ... Would you do me a favor ? There 's someplace I 'd like to go . It feels great ! This is my secret hangout . You 're the first one I 've ever brought here . It 's the only oasis in Jesus Town . It 's a natural spring . You should try some . Remember that talk ... That talk about dreams of the future ... Maybe it wouldn 't be so bad to be an ordinary bride ... Why are you staring at me ? You wanna come on to me or something ? Well , okay then . But you 'd better be good at it . I may look easy , but the truth is I ain 't ... Hey , you came to save this country , didn 't you ? Then fight with us ! Maybe it wouldn 't be so bad to be an ordinary bride ... Hakaider has entered the area . The halls of Parliament and 95 % of the soldiers have been destroyed . All surviving soldiers proceed to the central hall . Do you want to live ? Do you live and have a will of your own ? I never believed someone like you could exist . Whether you 're human or robot , we must keep discipline to maintain our order . Nonsense . Order made by whom ? I don 't recall accepting such rules . I am justice . In the name of justice , I will terminate you ! Indeed ... If you are justice then I am evil . Look . Do you know why flowers are beautiful ? Because they are obedient . People should be like flowers . You and I will grow flowers together . And we will make them bloom . I made you . Following me is your destiny . I can give you even more power . I will decide my own destiny . I am the destroyer and the judge . You are a failure , after all . Die , Hakaider . Stop ! Stay away ! Are you going to kill me ? You 're not worth killing . I am justice ... I am justice ... I am justice ... I am ...

You told me 800K would cover it . The fee for removing the implant is now 1-million-5 That is complete memory recovery . If you don 't want it all back ... they may come down . If I just wanted the silicon dug out of my back brain I could go to Mexico City ! I want a full restoration ! I want it all back . Johnny , the Sheba boys , they set the price . - I 've done what I can . - Come on , Ralfi . One more run , Johnny . And then you could cover it , provided it 's a rich one . - What have you got ? - It depends . Did you get that upgrade we were discussing ? Very good .

I 'm sorry to disturb you , Mr. Takahashi . Shinji is here . Tokyo wants me to recover the stolen data for PharmaKominat Industries of Zurich . Our operation in Beijing met with limited success . The PharmaKom traitors are dead . The courier , however , escaped with the data . He 's on his way here to Newark . I didn 't want to disturb you in your time of grief . It must be very difficult to lose an only child . I assumed you would be unavailable . I 'm not at liberty to say . I 'm to recover the head of the mnemonic courier ... - cryogenically preserved . - Preserved ? The traitors wiped the PharmaKom mainframe . If we lose the courier , they 've lost the data forever . If the courier is in Newark ... it 's my responsibility . You have part of the courier 's download code . Get me PharmaKom . Make your own images , get your life back ! The human race is waiting for you , zombies ! Just what 's the deal here ? Johnny boy , my ass . What 's the fucking score here ?

Don 't worry . They said they can extract . Extract ? What 's going on , Ralfi ? This feels like a blown deal , man . You say you have to get the data out . They are the only ones who can do it . There 's no other choice . Trust me . I will tell the driver where to take you . Yeah , sure . I need to get some work . About these episodes you 've been having . I want to get you back to the shop for some tests . Hey , are you listening ? - No more playing doctor , remember ? - That 's not what I meant . Look at them . They must be the oldest bodyguards in town . I 'm twice as fast as they are . I 'm not worried about your speed . I 'm worried about your nervous system ! Especially if you want to continue being a bodyguard . Get out of here , bitch . Take it easy . Your hired muscle 's aging on you , Ralfi . I could 've done you . Time you hired some young and fast . You mean like you ? You 're the best agent for bodyguards in town . I 'm the fastest , now Spider 's jacked my system . Hold out your hand . Okay . Fine . Just hold it there . - So ? - Just hold it there . You can hold it . - Can 't you ? - Yeah . Sure . See ? Cheap street implants . You 're damaged goods , bitch ! Spider man jacked you up all right . Jacked her up so tight she shakes . I cannot use you , not for muscle . Ever considered something a little less actively physical ? Like on your back , babe ? Or on your knees . I 'll get a gig , Ralfi . - Then I 'll get you . - Sure . Yo , J-Bone . What you clocking , man ? Some suit out from the city . - What for ? - I don 't know . Suits don 't come out here . You 're Johnny ? - Am I ? - I sure hope so . Come on in . We 're here to help you . We 've got to stop meeting like this . - Baldy . - Doctor will see you now . You lied . Yeah ! - Time to die . - Time ? We 've got all night , asshole ! - Let me see it . - Shut up , man . Yo , J-man . You weren 't on the menu . - I want you to do something for me . - Do ? Yes . Say ' bye . Hold it right there . You 're tooling up for an evening of this stuff , huh ? As long as you understand one thing : We 're even . I don 't owe you shit . Who are you ? I 'm J-Bone . I run Heaven . How sad . So very sad , Mr. Takahashi . The loss of a child . For I.M. Takahashi there is only memory . Memory of the play of conscience . An endless reckoning of the score . But I see you there , I know you . Your purpose is lost . At the very core of all your power there 's only an emptiness . Hollowness . Caught in the shape of the absent child . Easy as apple pie Easy as app ... - Johnny ! - They were waiting for me , Ralfi . 2 big , nasty men ! Johnny , please . Let me explain . Johnny ! You set me up , my friend . Johnny , it 's not my fault . There 's been a screw-up ! You 're dead if you don 't get this stuff out of my head . Shit ! Not on the head ! Don 't tell me you hit him on the head ! You know , I haven 't been in one of these for years . This way . Hooky , give me my shit . Come on . How you feeling , Johnny ? What 'd they upload , Ralfi ? The goddamn Library of Congress ? Feels like my brain 's gonna explode . I think your friend here can take care of that . Ralfi ... You lying sack of shit ! Please , let 's work this out like gentlemen . Johnny , In this business , you only fuck up once with the Yakuza . We 'll need a bucket . - It 's not sterile . - Put it here beside the table . - Can we talk about this ? - Talk . I have one image of the access code . You have the other 2 I 'll give you the data . Everybody happy . You don 't understand . They want the data and everything it 's ever been stored in . There 's less danger of information decay . And , we don 't have to worry about anyone going in with mnemonic sensors . These days , you see ... dead men can tell tales . There gotta be a way to work this out ! There is . Hurry up . Please . This is getting disgusting . What the fuck is going on ? I 'll slit his fucking throat , bitch . So ? The other guy 's gonna cut his whole head off . - Jane , say we pay you to walk away ? - I 'll pay 20 grand . You wouldn 't believe the shit you 're in . - 50 - Deal . You bitch ! It 's okay . I got the gun . Let 's go . Time to go ! Bitch ! Hey ! You could have fucking killed me ! Get out of my way ! - What are you doing ? - My gear . In here . - Back door . - Thanks , J-Bone . We 'll find you again ! Count on it ! Down ! You LoTeks will regret this . I have to get on-line . Must be somebody I can talk to square this . 50 thou ' , you said . Time I see the color , right ? Right . You were terrific . So if you 'll point the way out and give me an account number for the cash ... Account number ? I 'm on you till you pay , mister . How come they wanna cut off your head anyway ? I mean usually they just off people around here . - Long story . - Well , I 'm gonna be around until I get paid , so ... I can carry nearly 80 gigs of data in my head . 160 if I use a doubler . Trouble is somebody stuck in a lot more , and I don 't know how to get it out . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . You 're a smuggler ? In your head ? What 's wrong ? Come here . Sit down . Sit down . Oh , man , you are fucked up severe . Stay quiet , boy . Okay ? Papa ! Takahashi . How sad . The loss of a child . They know that your purpose in life has been lost . It died with your daughter . You have become a risk to them . Take a good look at their errand boy . The one who wants the courier 's head . He 's plotting to destroy you . - You must neutralize him , Takahashi . Now - and we can talk . I promise you ... the courier ... what he carries ... can give you new purpose in life . I was PharmaKom , and I ... They 're listening . They 're everywhere . Excuse me , sir , but Shinji is here , with 2 of his men . You can 't just walk in here ! I told them to wait , Takahashi-san . - Who are they ? - They are my Kobun . Twice you tried to capture the courrier . Twice you have failed . And you didn 't inform me . Don 't let that happen again ! Locate him . Inform me . I will supervise his capture . Understood ? Yes , sir . It 's just my stuff . Mace , throwing spikes , grenade . You let me sleep ? You needed it . I told you I was in a hurry . I 'm a dead man if I don 't get this out of my head . Hey . Do you ever sneak a look at what you carry ? Usually there 's a code , like a lock . Well , when there isn 't ? No . It goes with the territory . Safer for me . Safer for the client . How come you knew those , uh ... Oh , call them LoTeks . I sort of hung with them when I was a kid . How do you fit all that shit in your head anyway ? Must have been pretty good at memorizing , huh ? Implant . Wet-wired . I had to dump a chunk of long-term memory . You had to dump a chunk of what ? - My childhood . - Your childhood ? Really ? All of it ? You can 't remember a thing ? Maybe there 's some residual traces . Every now and then there 's something , but I can never hold onto it . That 's a seriously weird-ass thing to do . Maybe I didn 't lose anything I wanted to keep . I needed the space for the job . You got parents and stuff ? You got parents and stuff ? Yeah . Once . But I haven 't seen them in years . Anyway , I don 't think about it much , okay ? What do you think about ? When you 're alone ? I think I want to get out of this rat hole . I want to get on-line . I need a computer ! - Where 'd you learn to do that ? - I used to have a summer job breaking and entering . I need a Sino-Logic 16 ...

So , what exactly is it that you want ? - Your data out of my head . - That can be arranged . - Let 's meet . - Where ? You 're crazy , man . They 're gonna chop your fucking head off ! No . They 'll negotiate . They 're corporate . So 's the Yakuza . Listen , if you don 't come , fine . It 's a business meeting . It 's not your kind of scene .

You got NAS ! - No ! - You have the black shakes . Whatever it is you have , you 're sidelined , right ? I 've got to make this meeting . Hey ! Hey ! Can you hear me ? Spider . He could help you ! He could help me . I , too , was stricken by the sickness that devours the silver pathways of the soul . But the Lord came to me and I was healed ! And made post-human ! The darkness waits upon you now but I have come ... to lead you into the light ! My children , I sense the need for meditation . I must leave you now . The sermon is over .

It 's not my work that got her this way . My work is clean . Besides , you don 't get this shit from amp jobs . That 's a myth . - So what does cause it ? - What causes it ? The world causes it . This causes it ! This causes it ! Information overload , all the electronics around you poisoning the airwaves ! Technological fucking civilization ! But we still have all this shit , because we can 't live without it . Let me do my work . Whoa . Street preacher 's out . J-Bone , you copying ? That son of a bitch doesn 't have one natural bone left in his body . He really a preacher , J-Bone ? Preacher ? That motherfucker 's got God and technology ass-backward .

PharmaKom , Newark . - Johnny ! - What are you doing ? - Just looking . - Don 't touch anything . Who the fuck are you anyway ? - Johnny . - Johnny who ? Just Johnny . It looks like a full-service shop here . How are you on brain implants ? Silicon implants , neural overlays , memory augmentation ? We don 't get much of that out here in Newark , Just Johnny . Kind of upscale for us , you know ? - Got mine in Singapore . - Oh , yeah ? What 's your deal , Just Johnny ? I got this problem . Up here . " They err in vision . They stumble in judgment . For all the tables are full ... of vomit and filthiness . So that there is no place clean . " You should have seen it before . - Isaiah . - Isaiah ? Mine 's Hooky . Hey ! The girl that took Ralfi 's boy out of the back room . Who is she ? You expect me to remember half the shit ? Heal ! Oh , man . Why 'd you have to do that ? - Who 's the girl ? - A wanna be . She 's always hanging around here looking for a job . - Name ? - Jane . More . - One of Spider 's jobs . - Spider ? He 's a flesh mechanic ... implants and shit , you know ? They said he used to be a legit doctor once , but ... Where ? They did some serious shoehorning to get that in there . Let 's skip the technical critique , okay ? I need some help here . You don 't know the half of it . Must be hurting like hell . Think I need you to tell me that ? I got 320 gigs in here . Yeah ? What is it exactly ? What kind of stuff ? I haven 't got a clue , and I don 't have a download code either . Hey . You doing okay ? Good girl , Janie . You brought him to the right place . - You can fix him ? - I don 't know . With his seepage , if I could work a download ... I don 't know if the product would be coherent . Fuck the product . I just want it out . I wish it was that simple . Allcome . Dr. Allcome . Ever hear that name ? - Maybe . - Where is he ? I said Maybe ! Why do you want to see him ? Oh , come on , Spider . I 'll make sure Just Johnny gets to see who he needs to see but you need bed rest , down time . He 's my client . I 'm telling you , you 've got to sleep ! Just tell me where to go . All right . I 'll drive you . Right . - Halt , sinners ! - Fuck ! Spider , look out ! - Who the fuck was that ? - You don 't want to know . Jesus . - Where are we ? - You 'll see . He 's been this way for an hour now . I don 't know what to do with him . If we still got any Paralon B , give him 20 mg 's . Fucking PharmaKom , man . That shit costs 2 grand per clinical unit . Okay , keep him warm and bring his charts . Here are the charts , Doctor . Where 's Dr. Allcome ? " Dr. Allcome " is a name used in hospital when we 've got a major problem - and don 't want to spook the patients . - What ? " Doctor all come to ward 7 . " We drop everything and haul ass to wherever . Usually means a crazy , somebody violent . But I saw it on the fax buffer . That fax was meant for us . Who 's " us ? " Hey , wait a minute ! Who 's " us ? " The NAS underground . People who keep this place going . People like me . Get on the table . Why ? Don 't be a bigger asshole than you have to . Just get on the table . All right . Jack in . Lie down . Let 's take a look at this shit . - No access code ? - Except for one image out of 3 It won 't help . What 'd they use ? Random images ? Yeah . From the TV . I 've got some decryption codes here . I 'll run and see if I 'll come up anything . Janie , you should really try lie down . Can you break the code ? If I get lucky . Really lucky . - Fuck ! - No dice ? - No . But I can get it out . - How ? A general anesthetic , a cranial drill and a pair of forceps . I could die , too , right ? It 's gonna kill you anyway , when it ruptures . If I take it out , you 'll probably survive . You 'll probably lose some fine motor skills . You might not be able to remember anything for more than 3 minutes at a time . Fuck that ! Let me tell you something . Start with what you 've got in there and what it 's worth to the world ! You 're carrying the cure for NAS . You 're telling me I got ... PharmaKom 's complete RD on their cure for Nerve Attenuation Syndrome . Plus the record of the field trials to prove that it works ... and it really works . You mean , like a real cure ? They could have you straightened out in 3 weeks , Janie . You and everybody else . Everybody 's trying to cut off my head . They take it back to Saigon and run it through a quantum interference detector . Then they would have the cure . We wouldn 't . You keep that thing in your head and nobody can save you . Plus , the cure is gone forever . I can save the cure . Even with the code , the seepage is so bad it 'd probably come out as garbage . What 's it supposed to matter to me if I 'm dead ? Follow me ? The cure can save millions . You 're gonna die anyway if we don 't get it out . All I know is that whatever 's in my head is worth a lot of money . Why should I trust you ? You 're supposed to be my bodyguard here . You 're not walking out of here with that cure in your head ! You say that sinner 's head holds the Lord 's cure ? ! That cure is mine ! Behold your savior ! Jane , get him to Jones ! Go ! Get him to Jones ! It 's your only chance ! Go ! Go ! Who is Jones ? He 's that guy who fucks your mother . Where are they ? I couldn 't make the meeting , but I 'm still up for it . - Are you ? - Certainly . This time : On the bridge , landfill 5 Bring the rest of the code . I 'll find you . I 'll be there . I want to negotiate . Yes , sir . Great . Now they don 't kill you , J-Bone will . Listen to me , Takahashi , before it 's too late . We 're running out of time . He 's carrying the cure for ... I told her if she wanna get with me then I wanna get with her . And screw the physical disability . You know what I 'm saying ? Because it 's about the feeling , right ? What 's up ? Wind , maybe . Listen up ! Hey ! What do you think ? I mean , it 's crazy , but if it 's really the cure to NAS in my head , it could save you . and It could save everybody . Who is this Jones guy Spider said was our only chance ? He 's ... He was in the navy . In the war . They put a lot of stuff in his head . Kind of like you . - Memory augments ? - I don 't know . You 'll see . Man , somebody crazy down there is getting on my nerves . Ratlands are full of crazies , Stick . Ignore it , man . No , man . Right down there . It 's Spider 's van . Yep . Better tell J-Bone . I got an idea . Let 's drop a bug on Spider man . Forget it . Check it out . I 'm gonna do it . Hey , don 't even say that . J-Bone 'll shit if he hears you . You know how jumpy he 's been lately . - No , I 'm gonna do it . - Hey ! Wake up , damn it ! - Shit , man . - That 's what they 're for . Shit ! Man , you are an idiot ! What the fuck is going on ? You know , all my life ... I 've been careful to stay in my own corner . Looking out for number 1 No complications . Now suddenly ... I 'm responsible for the entire fucking world ! Everybody and his mother is trying to kill me ... if my head doesn 't blow up first . Maybe it 's not just about you anymore . Listen . You listen to me . You see that city over there ? That 's where I 'm supposed to be . Not down here with the dogs and the garbage ... and the fucking last month 's newspapers blowing back and forth ! I 've had it with them ! I 've had it with you and I 've had it with all this ! I want room service ! I want the club sandwich . I want the cold Mexican beer . I want a $ 10,000-a-night hooker ! I want my shirts laundered ... like they do at the Imperial Hotel ... in Tokyo . We 've got to see Jones . Spider sent us . Where 's Spider ? He 's dead . Not in there . Earlier . At the hospital . If Spider sent you , come on . J-Bone , help me . Come on . Keep it together . Help . Right here . You too . I got him ! He 'll be all right . Go on . - Tell Shinji to meet me at the bridge . - He 's on his way , sir . - My helicopter . - It 's waiting , sir . You okay ? I 'm alright . I saw ... I almost saw ... As if it was ... a memory . It 's time to meet Jones . We tap into the main line , get all the juice we need stored up in batteries . We built Heaven completely out of straight-world junk ... all hauled up here piece by piece . We work for Spider and his people ... and anybody else who is fighting the system . We out shit for them . What do you mean , " out " ? Heaven . The heart and soul . This is where we fight back . We strip the little pretty pictures from their 500-channel universe . Recontextualize it . Then we spit the shit back at them . Special data . Things that 'll help people ... like stuff we get from Spider . We wide-band it . Broadcast it . Go global . Bounce it off the satellites that Jones hacks for us . Way the navy got him hooked up ... he cuts through hard encryption like a knife through butter . Code breaker . Good . I can 't wait to meet him . Right this way . Jones . - It 's a fish . - It 's a mammal . He 's a friend , sailor . Not only is he a mammal , but he 's a junkie . Navy got him all addicted to this to make him work for ' em . I just give it to him so he thinks he 's still swimming ' . This was Spider 's best bet ? One thing Spider wasn 't was stupid . Jones is set up to sample software from enemy subs . Infra-sound scan . Right through the hull . Jones 'll feed you can opener codes . - We 'll try to get you out in time . - Wait a minute . Have you done this before ? Has the fish ? - How dangerous is this ? - Look , just keep your head still . Jones has to triangulate infra-sound into your implant . Move around too much ... could microwave your frontal lobe . Forget it . Look , man , at least you got a chance . It 's up to you . Do what you got to do . Give me what you got of the download codes . I will tell you what sectors to hit . Use the rocket launcher only if we lose the element of surprise ! Fan out ! Prepare to go up ! Ninja Maroni , remain here ! Set up the broadcast antennas . Everybody , clear out of the infra-sound zone ! Now . We 'd set for hours of this shit 'cause it was an accident , man . It was a shit fucking accident . It wasn 't my fault . We were just fooling around . I just don 't want to do nothing no more . Hear what I 'm saying ? Hear what I 'm saying , buddy ? Hey , buddy ! Maroni ! Motherfuckers ! Stations ! You all know the drill ! - What did you get ? - We didn 't get it . We 're not gonna get it right now . - The only way left is gotta hack your own brain . - J-Bone , the fuel tanks ! Shit . It 's the Yakuza . Give me that . I was almost there . I could feel it starting to ... Mr. Smith ? PharmaKom ? Not really . You can 't shoot me . Not in the head . Takahashi ! Do you know what he is carrying in his head ? He 's carrying the cure for NAS . Your daughter died to protect PharmaKom 's profit margin . Treating the disease is far more profitable than curing it . They had the cure ... 8 months ago , Takahashi . PharmaKom , the company that I created ... let your daughter die . Shinji . Hello , Johnny . Raise your chin . Let 's make this clean . Kiai ! If I fall , you don 't get the head , right ? If you lose the head , you 're fucked ! Jesus time . Jesus is waiting . Come to Jesus . God 's holy cure must come to me , I am his servant ! The cure . The holiest of communions . And when I hold God 's cure , I 'll be God ! Please help me ! He 's made you the vessel of His mercy as I am the vessel of His wrath . Jones . What spawn of Satan ...

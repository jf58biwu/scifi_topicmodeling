[ Man Narrating ] Miss Parker is trying to quit smoking ? How ? Nicotine patch . Personally , I can only applaud that resolve . Sydney , resolve is one thing , but homicide is another . I just got word Jarod made contact ? - How are you feeling ? - Guess . [ Clears Throat ] Okay . We got a high-priority e-mail from Jarod ... but it was addressed to Sydney . - Put it on the screen . - It was tagged " personal . " - On the screen ! - It 's all right , Broots . I don 't have any secrets from Miss Parker . Haven 't you ever seen anyone chew gum before ? " Sydney , you 're expected at the Twin Cities Hotel in Minneapolis , Minnesota ...

[ Man ] We 're around back . We 'll meet you in the alley . [ Man ] Check you all out front . You don 't look like no stone killer to me . Well , looks aren 't everything . [ Mock British Accent ] Yes , I 'd like to have a carton of menthol cigarettes ... waiting on her pillow for her for when she arrives . Uh , yes , the name is Parker , Miss Parker . Oh ! Jolly good . That would be lovely . Really . [ Chuckling ] Well , thank you . Very good . Cheers . [ Wheezing Laugh ] - [ Phone Rings ] - [ Clears Throat ] [ British Accent ] Broots here . Mr. Raines ? Uh , sir . Secur ... S-S-Security situation ? Uh , no , I don 't , uh ... I don 't know anything ... about any , uh , transmissions concer ... concerning Jarod . Come on in . How you doin ' ? Come on over . Have a seat . I 'll stand . Mr. Beaulieu offered you a chair . Hush up , Donny . You 're gonna have to forgive my nephew . He 's young . He 's just full of the devil . You ever suck a crawfish , Mr. , uh ... Doe . Jarod Doe . Not that I recall . Well , it 's real simple . You just rip the head off like that and suck . I 'd like to get this over with as quickly as possible . Well , I admire your candor , Mr. Doe . Ain 't enough of it in the world to suit me . Reason you was hired ... was you have no past connections here in New Orleans . Nobody knows your face . This , in turn , gives you no future connections to me . Now the word is , you 're clean and discreet ... except for that ... picture-taking business . Guy whacks people and takes snapshots ? What 's that about ? Your business is your business ... mine 's mine . I want you to know the fact that you 're a cripple , uh ... has no effect on my confidence in you . That 's very generous . Maybe if you hang around , we can get you a special parking place in front of the club . [ Chuckles ] This old boy 's name is Benjamin Worth . His address is on the back . Why do you want him killed ? Your business is your business , and mine 's mine . Twenty-five thousand now ... and 25,000 when it 's done . After confirmation of Worth 's death ... you 'll get identification of a second target . Second target ? Same deal . I 'm gonna send Donny here with you ... to act as my eyes and ears . Have you got a problem with that or something ? 'Cause if you do , I can make a phone call and get somebody else in here . No problem . I 'm your man . Yeah , I know you are . [ Clears Throat ] What 's this ? - I need film . - Go to a drugstore . High-speed , S.G.R. 3200 , black and white . For my snapshots . Where the hell am I supposed to find it ? That 's not my problem . Pick me up in my hotel in three hours . My instincts sayJarod wouldn 't have brought me here without a reason . I don 't care about your instincts . This whole thing is just another one ofJarod 's snipe hunts . - [ Phone Rings ] - [ Sighs ] What ? Where have you been ? I 've been trying to reach you . - Broots , calm down . - Listen , Raines knows . - Knows what ? - About the transmission from Jarod . Did you tell him where we are ? No ! It 's just a matter of time before he comes down here and he 's snooping around . You know , he 's got this place wired . Broots , where are you calling from ? [ Disgusted Sigh ] Mutant . - Is there a problem ? - Isn 't there always ? What the hell is going on ? [ Sydney ] I think I know why we 're here . It 's only been on the market three weeks . The plumbing 's shot , and it needs a new coat of paint ... but you won 't find a safer neighborhood in New Orleans . It seems very nice . - Are you from the real estate company ? - Uh , no , ma 'am , I 'm not . Actually , ma 'am , I represent a vintage automobile house in Baton Rouge . I was wondering ... Do you know this man ? Sonny Herbert . I haven 't seen him in nearly 25 years . - I 'm interested in the car that he 's leaning on . - His pride and joy . He used to live here . He had an office down in Fat City . I don 't remember exactly where . I can still see all those photographs he had pinned up around his room . - Photographs ? - Of the kids . Mr. Herbert was a private investigator . He specialized in finding lost children . [ Frustrated Grunt ] What could possibly make this trip more depressing ? [ Sighs ] - [ Water Splashing ] - [ Man Grunts , Laughs ] Oh , I 'm thirsty . Come on . Sweetheart , go get yourself another Hurricane . [ Coughs ] Hurry back . Go , go ! Hurry up . Mmm . Ahh . Hey . What do you want ? I came here to kill you . Well , that should work . But I 'm going to need your help . [ Knocking On Door ] Yeah . I 'll be right there . Gotta go . Stay cool . - I 'm telling you , I don 't know where it all went . - No . Listen to me . Listen to me ! I don 't care about excuses . For $ 300 a night , I want ice ! [ Both ] Hi ! Very funny , Sydney . I 'm sorry ? The cigarettes that you left on my pillow . I had nothing to do with that . Jarod . You told him about the patch , didn 't you ? - I ? - [ Both ] Doctor ? - Excuse me ? - We didn 't realize ... - That you 'd be attending ... - The conference . Excuse me . I need a very large drink . - Don 't you ... - Recognize us ? - It 's Millie Pilcher . - And Tillie Pilcher . - We were part of the week-long ... - International study program ? I 'm afraid you 're mistaking me for someone else . - We could never ... - Forget you ... [ Both ] Dr. Jacob . [ Sydney 's Voice Echoing ] Jacob . ! [ Jacob 's Voice Echoing ] Sydney . ! We 're really gonna do this . We 're gonna whack this guy out . No , you 're gonna stay here and watch that gate . Hey , I came here to do the deed , not play watchdog . Now you listen to me . This is not some field trip ... or a correspondence course that you order off the back of a match pack . People will die , and when they do ... it will be done by me , my way ... alone . Is that clear ? Is that clear ? Don 't have to get run over by no truck to get out of the road . - [ Two Gunshots ] - [ Thudding ] [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] He 's dead ? - What the hell are you doing up here ? - I asked you a question . Yeah , he 's dead . Everything went , um , smooth ? I didn 't hear any complaining . Help me carry him downstairs . I wanna see the body . - Are you kidding me ? - What do you think ? Now the next time you get the urge ... to stick a gun in my face ... you better make sure you pull the trigger . Help me carry him downstairs . Why are we stopping ? Gonna get rid of the package . - Here ? - Uncle Tug 's fond of fertilizing this field . Shovel 's in the back . Jacob spent the next several months in the hospital . He was eventually transferred to a private-care clinic . - When did ... - The accident occur ? August 2 , ' 67 . - Would you ... - Excuse us ? - It was nice ... - Meeting you . Thanks for your help . You shoot ' em , you bury ' em . Let 's go . Souvenir of a dead man . - Did you see it happen ? - Not exactly . Not exactly ? I saw him plant the guy , but I wasn 't there when he popped him . I work alone . The pictures will give you the up close and personal . I 'll take the double prints . Here 's our next target . This time I want it seen with real eyes . Understood ? It 's your party . Hey . When do we move ? I 'll call you . - Why does Tug Beaulieu want you dead ? - That 's the $ 64,000 question . He 's only paying me 50 . Hey . Put yourself in my shoes . You break into my house . You put a gun to my neck . You tell me somebody 's gonna kill me . Then you fake my murder , you bury me , and you give me a straw to breathe through . - Your point ? - The point is I don 't even know who the hell you are ! My name is Jarod . Why does Tug Beaulieu want you dead ? Business conflicts . Conflicts ? I own some jazz clubs . Beaulieu wanted to buy me out . - I wasn 't interested . - He 's willing to kill for those clubs ? The Quarter 's a small place , but the land 's invaluable . Wait a second . Where are you going ? Look , you 're not the only person that Beaulieu has a murder contract on . - Oh , my God . - What ? [ Sighs ] That 's my wife . Y-Your wife ? B-But you were in the pool with ... Separated . We 're in a healing period . She runs one of the clubs . I run the other one . Don 't answer the phone , and don 't go in the bathroom . Well , wait a minute . Supposing I gotta , you know ? I ain 't goin ' in this . [ Sighs ] Come here . Who the hell is that ? That 's the guy that was really going to kill you . Um ... ice bucket will be just fine . Good . I 've had the building on the market a couple of years . Haven 't had much interest since Mr. Herbert went away . I 'd have cleared out the rest of this junk ... but I 'm just gonna blow the place up and sell the land . I 'm sure glad you didn 't . Do you mind if I take a look ? Mm-mmm . So you say you 're one of those kids Sonny was lookin ' for ? I don 't know . I was hoping there was something that Mr. Herbert had here ... that would help me find my parents . You said there were some other men that came looking for him ? Just fore Mr. Herbert disappeared . They claimed he owed them money . Tell the truth , they looked like vending machines with heads . [ Chuckles ] So I didn 't ask too many questions . Oh , there was a weird-looking one with an oxygen tank . - Oxygen tank ? - Yeah . Spooky-looking guy . Had deep-set eyes . You know him ? We 've met . Did they take anything ? They was in a pretty big hurry . I never got a chance to tell ' em about the stuff down in the basement . The basement ? A dozen boxes full of files and photos . Mostly they 're missing kids . - Is this all there is ? - That 's it . - It 's not here . - Nothin ' about your parents ? - These files , they only go back 20 years . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm not here . I 'm not here ! [ Sighs , Panting ] I 'm not here . [ Sighs ] I 'm not ... here . - [ Thunderclap ] - Get your mind off of your career for one second , will you ? I 'm talking about the children . What 's so troubling about children , for God 's sakes ? - Do you know how we got those children ? - I know what I need to know . No , no . You know what the Centre wants you to know . You ... You always do this . You always push away what doesn 't fit into your pristine view of the world . - All you want to do is poison the good things in your life . - Sydney ! [ Honking , Crashing ] [ Knocking On Door ] [ Whispers ] Jacob . [ Simultaneously ] We have to talk . I don 't wanna ruin your fun , but how long you plan on keepin ' him in here ? I don 't know . I 've grown sort of attached to him . That 's a sick man . I like it here . Peaceful . Quiet . The building manager told me that you worked for Sonny for the last 10 years . Eleven . [ Chuckles ] He put an ad in a local paper and misspelled a few words . I took pity on him . What you want with him anyway ? When I was a little boy ... I was ... separated from my parents . I believe they might have hired Mr. Herbert to find me . - You check all the files ? - They don 't date back far enough . I need to speak to Sonny personally . - That 's impossible . - Why is that ? He 's in a hospital . Burns over 80 % of his body . Police say it was an accident . Fell asleep smoking . You don 't sound convinced . Sonny was an insomniac . He 'd never have fallen asleep so deep that he 'd set himself afire . I tried to tell the police ... but there 's no record of his problem ... so they let it go . There 's something else . Sonny thought he was being followed . After he got hurt , I got scared . Where is he now ? V.A. Hospital , Slidell . - After we spoke earlier ... - We both had the same ... - Thought about your ... - Accident . Yes ? You said the accident was on ... - August 2 ... - 1967 ? - The last time we saw ... - Dr. Jacob ... Was on the Monday before . And you can both remember a specific Monday ... 30 years ago ? - It was the day before our 10th ... - Birthday . - And the first time we 'd ever seen ... - [ Both ] A gun . - Dr. Jacob was shouting . - [ Sydney ] At you ? - Oh , no , but it was a very ... - Loud argument . - The other man said ... - " If you 're not part of the solution ' " ... " Then you 're part of the problem . ' " - Then Dr. Jacob began ... - To argue back . And that 's when ... He pressed the gun ... into Dr. Jacob 's neck . - Dr. Billy . - Yes . - Dr. Billy . - [ Sydney ] Billy ? You mean Dr. William Raines . [ Simultaneously ] Dr. Billy scared us to death . [ Knocking ] [ Grunts ] Son of a bitch ! [ Grunts ] Now I 'm going to forget you just did that ... and it would be disrespectful to kill you in front of family . Where 's Ben Worth 's body ? [ Jarod ] Is that why you 're here ? I moved him . Just in case hotshot here started mouthing ' off ... and somebody went looking ... you 'd be protected . - Not that you 'd do something like that . - What about the woman ? - I saw you go to her house , and you never came out . - You 've been a busy boy . We all have quirks . Mine happens to be taking photos , as you know . But even that gets boring , so I decided to take some live ones . Now what did I tell you about pointing guns at me ? Put it up . - She still alive ? - For the time being . I 'm going to do her in front of you . I know this little spot in the woods not too far from here . Perfect place for a woman who 's been abandoned by her husband ... to park her car , roll up the window ... and gas herself . Yeah . I knew you were the right man for the job . - Wait a minute . - What ? Story on the limp is you took one running from the cops in Chicago . Doctors had to take an inch of bone out . True ? - Yeah , it 's true . - Show me . - What ? - [ Gun Cocks ] Show me your knee . Is there anything else you 'd like to see ? Nah . Let 's go . I gotta use the can . [ Beaulieu ] Donny . ! No . We 've bothered Mr. Doe enough for one day . I 'm not gonna let you foul up his hotel room on top of it . Now let 's go . [ Deep Sigh ] So , Jarod , is everything set ? Cops will think she killed herself ... depressed about the disappearance of her husband ... and the failed business . [ Chuckles ] That 's just fine . Now about my money . - Well , uh , got a little problem there . - What kind of problem ? - This kind . - Now you know why nothin ever lands on my doorstep . - Do him . - A pleasure . Big mistake . You never learn , do you ? Doris . [ Ben ] Come here , baby . Come here . - Get in . - How much you want ? How much does he want ? You were gonna kill my wife . Think you can buy your way out ? All right , Ben . That 's enough . He gets the point . Yeah , right . Get in , or die . You too , squirrelly . Get in . Well , I think it 's time for my last photo shoot . Now , I 'm gonna ask you two some questions . You answer correctly , this 'll be over soon . Did you hire an assassin ... to kill Ben and Doris Worth ? I saw your leg . ! I seen that scar on there . ! It 's neat , huh ? A little mortician 's wax , a little pancake makeup , and voilà . Now , did you contract for the killing of Ben and Doris Worth ? I 'm afraid that 's not gonna do you any good . And I wouldn 't try smashing the window . Shatterproof glass . Well , looks to me like you boys aren 't interested in doing too much talking , so ... [ Both Coughing ] The exhaust . ! [ Jarod ] Hey , good luck to the both of you . Okay , he hired you to kill ' em , to kill all of 'em . ! - Donny ! - I could tell you where he buried the bodies ! - I can 't hear you . - All right , Jarod . I did it . All right , Jarod , I 'll give you $ 100,000 to open this door ! My , that 's an awful lot of money . A man would be crazy not to think that offer over . [ Coughing Continues ] I thought it over . No deal . Jarod ! - [ Coughing ] - You 're just gonna let ' em die ? I only put enough gas in the tank to scare them . The engine should shut off in about 30 seconds . I wish I could stick around to see how they try to explain that tape to the police . They should be here any minute . Hey , who could I say ? Thanks , pal . Thank you . You two , you work well together . You should consider a merger . - See ? - Oh , please , don 't start . I miss you , Jacob . And I 've missed you too , Sydney . Why has it taken you so long to talk to me ? I was afraid . I thought that , um ... if I tried and failed ... you 'd be gone forever . Jacob ... that night in the car ... I 've already told you , Sydney . It wasn 't your fault . But you see , I wasn 't listening ... to what you were really trying to say to me . You were in trouble . You needed my help . I was ... ashamed . I couldn 't tell you what I 'd done ... the things ... Jacob , did Raines have anything to do ... with what happened to you , to us ? You know the answer to that , Sydney . - [ Knocking , Door Opens ] - [ Miss Parker ] Sydney . You ready to go ? Don 't say a word . - [ Machinery Hissing ] - [ Monitor Beeping ] [ Woman ] You can try to speak to Mr. Herbert ... but since the accident , he drifts in and out of consciousness . Mr. Herbert . - Mr. Herbert . - [ Quiet Moan ] Sonny . - [ Grunts ] - My name is Jarod . Mr. Herbert , 30 years ago ... my parents may have hired you to find me . You were a private investigator . You used to help find lost children . Ch-Children . Mr. Herbert . M-M-Mr . Herbert . Do you recognize this woman ? - This is my mother . - Oh . Do you remember her name ? Nice ... woman . Wanted to find ... her little boy . Yes . That 's right . Do you remember her name ? Mr. Herbert . Mr. Herbert , do you remember her name ? [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] Remember her name . [ Rings ] - Hello . - [ Jarod ] Hello , Sydney . Jarod . I wanted to thank you for sending me the photograph . What photograph , Jarod ? Sonny Herbert . Jarod , I did not send you any photos . In fact , I was just about to thank you ... for the message letting me know about the Twins Convention . Sydney ... I didn 't send you any message . Then who did ? [ Mews ]

 Debbie ? Debbie ? - Morning , Daddy . - Morning . Are you hungry ? Um , my ride should be here any minute . - Well , just have a little bit . It 's hot . - Did you remember ? Remember ? What ? My birthday , Daddy . I 've told you all year what I really , really want is - Is a trip to Paris . And you know what ? I can 't take you to Paris until you 're , like , 25 years old . Well , it never hurts to ask . - No . - [ Horn Honking ] - Well , I gotta go . Okay , wait . Take this . - Love you . See you tonight . - I love you too . See you ... tonight . [ Door Opens , Closes ] [ Man On Tape ] Beginner 's French . Hello . My name is Pierre . How are you ? [ Speaking French ] [ Repeating In French ] It 's bad enough that you talk to yourself , but in a second language ? - It 's French . - So is theJerry Lewis Fan Club , but I wouldn 't join . It 's - Debbie 's birthday 's coming up . I wanna surprise her with a trip to Paris . - Pop Tarts ? - They have 11 essential vitamins and minerals . - May I ask , uh , why are you here ? - Oh , I was in the neighborhood . - Since when ? - Since I couldn 't risk talking over the phone . Listen , don 't go to the Centre this morning . - I want you to go straight over to the Data Annex . - To the Data Annex ? Why ? Since you installed the new security software ... we 've detected three transfers ... of classified information from the Centre to the annex . [ Sighs ] There 's a leak in the Centre . All we know for sure is that after each transfer ... someone broke into the annex and took the information . - Jarod ? - You wrote the , uh , software . You find out . [ Young Sydney ] Tell me what you 've discovered , Jarod . Structural reinforcements here , here , here and here . It should allow the building to withstand an earthquake of 7.5 . Excellent , Jarod . Your design will save many lives . Yes , but if the reinforcements ... were to be damaged by an explosion by sabotage ... the whole thing would go down . Don 't worry . The Centre would never allow that to happen . [ Young Jarod ] I hope so , Sydney . If not , hundreds and hundreds of people could die . [ Young Sydney 's Voice ] Don 't worry . The Centre would never allow that to happen . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Jarod ] There . That 's all there is to it . Now you try , Kenny . - Oh , Jarod , I 'll never be able to do this . - Oh , sure you will . [ Man ] They found out you refused to complete the last sim ... and they asked for the three of us to come down here . [ Man # 2 ] We want to strongly encourage you to reconsider . [ Kenny ] Jarod , help ! Help ! It hurts ! Jarod ! [ Jarod ] No ! - [ Bell Jingling ] - Hey , George . - Hey . - Busy day , huh ? I 've seen livelier morgues . - Uh - - Yeah , sure , go ahead . Okay . [ Buzzer Sounds ] Hey , Norman . - So , I hear you 've had three data intercepts . - Four . It happened again last night . You know what I can 't figure out though is - What would anyone want from this place to begin with ? Top secret travel itineraries ? Clandestine expense reports ? Well , let 's see if we can unlock the mystery . This 'll take a couple of minutes to come up . I gotta go see a man about a horse . Hey , that 's a cool shirt . [ Beeping ] - Hey . - What ? Someone 's accessing this information right now . - What ? - Who the hell 'd want this ? Morning . [ Man On Tape ] Would you care tojoin me for a romantic dinner and a movie ? [ Speaking French ] Um - [ Repeating In French ] [ Continues In French ] [ Continues In French ] Oh , my God . [ Gasps ] Wait ! [ Man On Tape ] I would like coffee and a croissant . [ Speaking French ] - What 's up ? - We 've had an incident at Data Annex . [ Mr. Lyle ] Prelim says the entire in-house staffhas been " depersonneled . " - Broots was there . - He was spotted running from the scene . I dispatched a decon team to find him . A decontamination team for Broots ? Miss Parker , there 's a leak in the Centre . Someone downloaded " eyes only " data to a mole at the annex . Broots could be the mole . Hell , he could be the shooter for all we know . Broots ? Broots couldn 't do that . We don 't know that . Not for sure . All we know is that we 've been compromised . The Tower 's declared this a Schedule 7 incident . - Do you know what that means ? - We 're ghosting Broots . [ Tires Screeching , Horn Honking ] Hey , watch it ! Come on ! Come on ! Hello ? Hello ? - [ Ringing ] - Sydney . Sydney ! Oh , God . Thank God you 're there . - Broots , are you all right ? - Yes . No ! No , I 'm not all right ! Sydney , they-they killed everybody in the place ! And-And they 're trying to kill me ! They 're after me ! Calm down , Broots . - I can 't calm - I can 't calm - - Broots ? Syd ? Sydney ? - [ Dial Tone ] - Broots ? Sydney ! Hello ? [ Female Recording ] We 're sorry . Your cellular service has been deactivated . Please contact your provider for additional information . [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] Since you installed the new security software ... we have detected three transfers ... of classified information from the Centre to the annex . [ Broots 's Voice , Echoing ] There 's a leak in the Centre . - [ Ringing ] - Broots ? They 're all dead . Everybody 's dead . There 's a-There 's a man in there with a gun . He tried to kill me . - Tell me where you are . - Miss Parker sent me . - Where 's Miss Parker ? - She 's not here . Try and calm down . They 're not going to let us talk for long . - Sydney , what the hell is going on ? - You 're in great danger , Broots . You and everyone you know may be a potential target . Oh , God ! Debbie ! I don 't know what 's going on , Broots . Maybe you saw something . - We 're under a Schedule 7 . - A Schedule 7 ? - Remember your training . And , Broots ? - Yeah ? Don 't trust anyone . Sydney ? Sydney ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Standard procedure . Until we know what 's going on here ... Broots is persona non grata . For God 's sakes , Lyle . The man has a daughter to take care of . We can 't leave him out there . Broots and his daughter are not my problem . - [ Bell Ringing ] - Come on , Debbie . Come on . Where are you ? - Ha-ha ! - Get out of here , you little - - You 're dead ! - Get out of here , you little mongrel ! You 're dead ! Miss Parker . Debbie ! - [ Sydney 's Voice ] Broots , don 't trust anyone . - No ! Wait ! - Where 's my daddy ? - Miss Parker ! Debbie ! This isn 't good . Hello ? My computer . I 'm sorry , Debbie . I know I promised I 'd never use this . Shh , shh , shh , shh ! Oh ! Jarod ! Please . I 'm-I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to do it . - Do what ? - Whatever it is you 're gonna try and kill me for . I 'm not trying to kill you . I 'm here to help you . I 've been waiting for you . We don 't have much time . Little time . For what ? - You just have to trust me . - Sydney told me not - not to trust anyone . You might wanna reconsider that . Oh ! Get in the car . Get in the car ! - Are you all right ? - No . I 'm not all right . I 'm as far from all right as I 'm ever gonna be . I 've seen people murdered . They 've taken my daughter . They 've broken into my house . They 're tryin ' to kill me , and I 'm sitting here with you . No , no , I 'm not all right . I wanna know what the hell 's going on . It 's about the data intercepts you were sent to investigate at the annex . How is it that you know so much about what 's going on at the Centre ? A former Centre operative ... has been working with a coconspirator inside the Centre . In order to conceal their identities and their activities ... he murdered everyone at the annex . And now , he 's after you . But I don 't know anything , do I ? It doesn 't matter . All that matters is that he thinks you do . I don 't give a damn about me . I am only concerned about my daughter . She 's safe . I picked her up from school and took her to my house . And Sam 's keeping her out of harm 's way for now . The Cleaners reported in from the annex . - They found a mess , but few answers . - What about Broots ? The decon team 's still looking for him . They confiscated his home computer . It 's being cross-analyzed to see if we can pin him down as the leak . Broots isn 't the leak . But he could find out who is . That 's not how it works . Broots lives or dies on his own ... until and if this matter 's resolved . I 'm afraid Mr. Lyle does not share your sense ofloyalty . Centre reality check . Broots is expendable . I 'm not sure a monkey couldn 't do what he does . I can 't believe you weren 't spawned under some rock ... instead ofbeing born of the same flesh and blood I came from . As much as I hate to admit it ... Broots is more of a brother to me than you 'll ever be . I won 't throw him out like a piece of garbage . Hark . Do I hear violins playing ? Lyle , reality check . I intend to get to the bottom of the Centre 's problem ... without sacrificing Broots in the process . [ Broots ] Wow . I 've seen a lot of your old hideouts , but I never thought I 'd be here with you . Neither did I. You hungry ? [ Chuckles ] My daughter loves these . They have 11 essential vitamins and minerals . Listen , Jarod , I can 't stay here . I 've gotta find Debbie . Miss Parker took her . In fact , it was Miss Parker who sent me to the Data Annex in the first place . Miss Parker is many things , but she would never do that , especially to you . She doesn 't have it in her heart ... - or her eyes . - I know what you mean . The guy that shot up the annex - who shot at my house - now he had it in his eyes . [ Sydney ] Jarod , this is Damon . The Tower has asked him to work with you on some special projects . Jarod . I 've heard a lot about you . [ Kenny 's Voice ] Jarod , help ! Help ! It hurts , Jarod ! You know him ? Yes , I know him . For the past several months ... I 've been intercepting communications ... between a man named Damon and his source at the Centre . The source has been transferring sims that I performed to the Data Annex . But the Data Annex is only for storage ... of routine , unclassified information . That 's exactly why he had them transferred there . The lack of security allowed Damon ... to break in as needed and download the sims . But my new software found a trail leading right back to them . You were at the wrong place at the wrong time , Mr. Broots . - Damon was just covering his tracks . - Damn . He 's already used three of my sims . Now he 's stolen a fourth . I don 't know what it is . But I do know that he plans on using it tomorrow at 5 : 00 . But what 's so important about four old sims ... that would cause him to kill all those people ? Our clients were impressed with your recommendations ... to improve the safety of their aircraft . There 's one other thing , Sydney . I know it 's unlikely , but if the plane were to encounter ... a focused burst of electromagnetic energy in the ultrahigh frequency range ... the pilot would lose control . Jarod , I 'll be sure to alert our client about your concerns . You have nothing to worry about . I hope so , Sydney . [ Broots ] Oh , my God . And ... the subway ? And the consulate ? Damon took your work and used it to kill ? I need your help , Broots . I have to get back into the annex . I have to find out what that fourth sim is . We 've gotta stop Damon ... before there 's another headline . Okay , I 'll help . But before we go in ... I have to find out what 's happening to Debbie . But the Centre , they won 't let me in . - Well , they can 't keep me out . - [ Phone Beeping ] - [ Phone Ringing ] - This is Sydney . - Sydney , it 's Broots . - Broots , where are you ? - I gotta know where Debbie is . - Miss Parker took Debbie to her house . - She 's guarded around the clock . - Oh , thank God . And , Sydney , please thank Miss Parker for me , would you ? Mmm . There 's , uh , someone here l-I think you 'd like to speak to . - Sydney , Damon is back . - Damon ? - Are you sure ? - I 've seen him . He tried to kill Broots after he murdered everyone at the annex . Now he 's working with someone inside the Centre . They 're using my old sims to orchestrate attacks . I know when he 's planning to hit next ... but I don 't know how , and I don 't know where . Let me see what I can find out . But please be careful . - Remember what Damon is capable of . - Oh , I remember . I remember everything . There . That 's all there is to it . Now you try , Kenny . Oh , Jarod , I 'll never be able to do this . Sure you can . We 'll keep on practicing . Put this point there . Now press down the fold . Very good . - [ Kenny ] Jarod , help me ! Jarod ! - [ Jarod ] No ! [ Damon ] I knowJarod . I know how his mind works . He 'll come to me . [ Man ] We can 't take the slightest chance on them discovering our activity . I 'll take care of it . [ Broots ] Whoa . That 's what I call a cleanup . This is the computer Damon was at . We have 10 minutes max before they detect us . - Do you think you can find out what he was accessing ? - Well , I designed the system . Um , that 's a - that 's a maybe . [ Miss Parker ] So let me get this straight . They can send a man to the moon , but neither of you can open up Broots 's system ... to backtrack who the leak is in this place ? - We 're searching . - Search faster . - And where the hell have you been ? - I 've been ... occupied . You look frustrated . Well , your monkeys seem to have a bit of trouble peeling this banana . We 're all just trying to find the answers , Miss Parker . My Sweepers have also been unable to locate Broots 's daughter . Have any idea where she might be ? - Do I look like a babysitter ? - [ Man ] Uh , Miss Parker ? Someone 's accessing the computer at the Data Annex now . Who ? Based on the password , it appears to be ... Mr. Broots . Damn . Get me the imbecile who 's supposed to be guarding the annex . Now ! [ Broots ] Just about there . All right . Jarod , I know it 's not my place to ask ... but what exactly happened between you and Damon ? You 're right . It 's not your place to ask . - [ Door Closes ] - [ Footsteps Overhead ] - [ Whispering ] I 'm not done yet . - Keep working . Hold it ... right there . Real easy-like , bring that gun up where I can see it . Come on . Now , turn around slowly . [ Chuckles ] Well , well , well . Look what I got here . Well , at least I didn 't shoot him . Next time , you might wanna put some bullets in it . [ Muffled ] You wanna untie me ? [ Muffled ] Hey ! What are you doing ? Ooh . Boy - I could sure use a drink about now . I 'd settle for the D.S.A. That we just risked our lives for . Oh , yeah . Sure . I 'm sorry . - Jarod , please . - I 'm not going to do it . You have to finish this project . No , Sydney . I can 't do this . Jarod , we know the enemy is trying to genetically alter ... the smallpox virus to carry Ebola . Our only interest is in developing a vaccine to prevent a holocaust . I 'm not comfortable with this area of research . I don 't understand , Jarod . In order to make a vaccine , I have to re-create the deadly organism . - Mm-hmm . - Concentrations to achieve airborne toxicity ... solubility levels , half-lives . It would be too easy for somebody to take this information ... and use it destructively . I don 't wanna see that happen . This Damon - He 's gonna - He 's gonna use your work to biologically attack someone ? Tomorrow at 5 : 00 . The question is-Who ? What have you found out about the leak ? If I had Broots , I 'd be a lot further along . But as it is , your monkeys ... have only been able to identify that the Centre leak ... has arranged for the delivery of some kind of shipment . - To whom ? - They don 't know who or where or why or even when . That happens when you don 't have an opposable thumb . All we have to go on appears to be the shipment order . - It 's in code . - Brilliant analysis . They 're trying to break it now . Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know there was anyone here with you . Oh . I believe Mr. Lyle was just leaving . Well , I am really impressed with all you don 't know . I 'd love it if you 'd surprise me with something we can work with . I believe the two of you are taking the concept of sibling rivalry to new levels . Excuse me , Syd . I have work to do . 77 , 02 , 30 - [ Continues On Phone ] 14 , 98 , 1,500 . - What does it mean ? - Sorry , Jarod , I don 't know . That 's all I have . - I 'll get right on it . - Thank you , Sydney . Jarod , don 't let your feelings for Damon ... your desire for revenge - Don 't let it destroy you . This time , I 'm going to stop him . I know how you feel , Jarod . And how could you know how I feel ? I was a Pretender once . - Was ? - They gave me my freedom . I can get ' em to do the same for you . - I don 't trust them . - Yeah , neither did I. Just finish this last sim , and I promise you , we 'll walk out of here . [ Jarod ] We 've only got a few hours left . [ Groans ] I know it 's not difficult . It 's a simple problem . It 's - They 're the most trouble . You know better than anyone . It 's like the clues you leave us all the time . - I know we can crack it . - We have to . I want my life back . I want - I want my daughter back . She 's beautiful . Well , you know , I may not be the most successful person in the world ... but there 's one thing that no one else can do or be , and that 's her dad . She 's - I miss her . Don 't worry . You 'll see her soon . - Why are you doing this ? - Doing what ? Well , I try and catch you every day . I mean , it 's my job . But ... why are you helping me ? Because ... I respect you . Me ? I can only hope that one day , I 'll be half the father that you are . You know , I planned to spend her birthday ... traveling through France . Traveling . Traveling ! - These numbers aren 't code . - They 're G.P.S. Coordinates . - Exactly . - Date , time , location . Where and when Damon is going to receive the shipment . [ Broots ] Well , we know the " when " is in two hours ... and the " where " is in a small park outside of D.C. Come on . - Miss Parker . - One of the techs just gave this to me . An intercepted phone call . [ Sydney On Tape ] 98 , 1,500 . - [ Jarod ] What does it mean ? - Sorry , Jarod , I don 't know . That 's all I have . You gaveJarod information , information you stole from me . You gaveJarod information , information you stole from me . - Miss Parker , please . - No , Sydney ! I 'm out there risking my ass for Broots while you 're here working behind my back . You wanna tell me that 's not true ? - Parker , does Lyle know about this ? - For now , no . You wanna tell me why I shouldn 't give him that myself ? Sit down , please . Shortly beforeJarod escaped from the Centre ... we were having trouble controlling him . His growing sense ofhumanity was creating inner conflict over his work . Against my wishes ... the Centre brought in an operative named Damon ... to help break him . What I didn 't know was that Damon and the Centre had a hidden agenda . Damon exploited Jarod as he progressively gained his trust . They 've agreed . You finish this last sim , and you can leave . This virus they want me to develop - it 's a Pandora 's box . I don 't know who will have the key . Jarod , this is your freedom . Jarod was in turmoil . He came to see me for advice . - I tried to allay his fears . - So what happened ? - Obviously , the Centre never gave him his freedom . - It was all a lie . It wasn 't just another Centre exploitation ofJarod . It was the ultimate one . Jarod befriended Kenny ... a janitor at the Centre who possessed a childlike innocence . Jarod felt very protective ofhim ... and Damon knew that . That 's very good . Isn 't it , Damon ? And what 's this about ? [ Damon ] They found out you refused to complete the last sim ... and they asked for the three of us to come down here . Jarod , for you . We want to strongly encourage you to reconsider . [ Yelling ] - What are you doing ? - You have got one minute to change your mind . - Are you crazy ? - Jarod , listen to me ! Listen ! He 's gonna kill him , and probably both of us as well . Listen , for Kenny 's sake , finish the last sim and walk away from this place . [ Kenny ] Jarod ? [ Groaning ] Help ! Here . I already finished the sim . It has everything you need . Everything they need is on this ! Now take it ! What are you - Help , Jarod . [ Groaning ] - Jarod ! - No ! - [ Gunshot ] - No ! The Centre owns you , and there 's nothin ' you can do about it . Don 't make it so difficult next time . Three weeks later , Jarod escaped . - My God , Sydney . - Damon betrayed Jarod 's trust ... and he confirmed all of Jarod 's suspicions about the Centre . And destroyed Jarod 's hope ... of ever being given his freedom . Damon was later exiled for stealing Centre secrets . He 's doing it again now . Do you understand why I 'm trying to help ? I understand Broots is the loose end . And in order for him to survive , Damon has to be stopped ... for good . [ No Audible Dialogue ] He just handed Damon a metal case . - The smallpox ? - Worse . He 's not going to get away , not this time . Wait . Jarod ! Jarod ! Give me the case . Jarod . My friend . Let 's get one thing straight . I 'm not your friend . Now give me the case . Still worried about the innocent masses ? Still the same ? - Jarod - humanity 's seed of hope . - Give me the case . TheJarod I knew couldn 't pull that trigger . You wanna stop me , shoot me in the back . My guess is you 're still too human for that . [ Broots ] Jarod ! - [ Broots ] Now don 't move . - [ Jarod Groans ] Okay , just like that . - Why are you doing this ? - What ? You could take me into the Centre . The Schedule 7 or not , with me as the prize , they would welcome you back . Well , the way I figure ... there 's a time and a place for everything . And right now , I owe you . Besides , I respect you . - Ow . Me ? - Yeah . You help people . You care . When others look away , you-you try and make a difference . Well , I didn 't make a difference this time . And that 's why you can 't look away now , and neither can I. You know , considering what we 've been through ... I think I have a right to ask you this . What happened between you and Damon ? [ Sighs ] It 's on the D.S.A. Because , you know , I 've been thinking about what you said ... about discovering Damon 's pattern . It 's - It 's obviously political ... even possibly global . A private , nondenominational service ... to pray for an end to the Bosnian conflict ... is scheduled for 5.00 this afternoon ... here at Freedom Hall in Georgetown . - Take it ! - The service ... referred to by the parties as the " seed ofhope " - Humanity 's seed of hope . Will bring together representatives of the Czech Republic ... Serbia and Bosnia ... on the eve of the peace talks which are scheduled to start Monday in Washington . The Centre owns you , and there 's nothin 'you can do about it . - Oh , my God . - Broots ? - [ Woman On TV , Indistinct ] - Broots ? He 's going to hit the service . [ Miss Parker ] Sydney ? Sydney ? The floodgates have finally opened . The techs have finished putting all the pieces together . - You know where and when Damon is going to strike ? - The jet 's waiting . - What about Lyle ? - Leave him here to run his circus . [ Chorus Vocalizing ] [ Broots ] How do you think he 's gonna deliver the virus ? The wine ? Not everyone is going to take Communion . But everyone 's going to breathe the air . Jarod , look . It 's Damon . - Aerosol delivery . - He 's gonna spray the crowd . - Get everyone out of here . - Okay . Uh - Excuse me ! Uh , I 've been alerted there 's a bomb in the building . So if you could all just please exit , uh , quickly and calmly , please . Jarod . You just can 't leave it alone , can you ? This isn 't about you . You 're using my work to infect countless numbers of people . And for what ? Gotta make a living . Who 's helping you at the Centre ? The same person who always has . - Ow ! - Back off , Jarod ... or you can say good-bye to another friend . Not this time . [ Grunts ] Damon ! Let him go . This is between us . Your friend comes with me . I 'll let him go ... when I know I haven 't been followed . That 's funny . I believed you once . - Then you know what I 'm capable of . - No , Jarod . It 's over , Damon . You 're not gonna pull that trigger , Jarod . You don 't have it in your eyes ... just like when we were together at the Centre . He has a daughter ... who needs him . That doesn 't make any difference . [ Groans ] No ! It does to me ! King me . - Daddy ! - Ah ! - Debbie ! - Daddy , I missed you so much . [ Broots ] Oh ! Oh , I missed you too . Oh ! I got something for you . Happy birthday . Paris ? Je t 'aime , Daddy ! Je t 'aime aussi . Sam , let 's go . There 's a couple of things I need to wrap up at the Centre . Good game , kid . I love you , Daddy . - This is Sydney . - [ Jarod On Phone ] It 's me . - You okay , Jarod ? - Physically . It 's natural to struggle to come to terms with what happened . I never ... pulled the trigger before . I pray you never have to again , Jarod . The guilt you 're feeling comes from a conflict ... over your desire to exact revenge for Kenny ... and the necessity of what you did . I just keep playing the moment over and over in my head . You saved Broots 's life ... and the lives of untold numbers of people . I just ... feel so empty . You have to forgive yourself , Jarod . There 's an old saying : " He who saves but one life ... saves the entire world . " L-I have to go .

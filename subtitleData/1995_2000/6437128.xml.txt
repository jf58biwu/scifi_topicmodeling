 You 'll make man . No . Woman . Woman . [ THEME MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! No heart of gold- - just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? He 's alive . Alive ! [ MUSIC PLAYING ] OK , Chet . A few quick instructions before we leave . Don 't touch the VCR , I 'm taping my stories . And don 't answer the phone in my office . Don 't use my golf clubs . Don 't sweat on my abdominizer . No visits from your tractor pull buddies . Yours , not mine . So , I guess that makes you keeper of the castle . Wyatt 's well-being is in your hands . Chet , are you listening ? No prob . My favorite little bro 's in good hands . [ HORN HONKING ] Oh , that must be the shuttle . If there 's an emergency , the number for the Golden Fetter Spa is taped to the fridge . Golden Fetter 's ? Uh-oh . You two aren 't going to some kinky sex camp , are you ? Well , I think we 'd better go because the- - - Look at the time . - Shuttle is waiting . - Darling-- - We 're late . Have fun , Chet . Way more than I needed to know . Two weeks of no curfew . I am parent-free . How 'd you get out ? Doggy door . Club Lust . The walls in here are drenched with the sweat of the beautiful people . And tonight , we are going to add our own distinctive musk . Two admissions , my good man . Chuck E. Cheese is two blocks east . Good on . Yes , indeed . You had no way of knowing this when you tossed off that witty ha-ha , but my father happens to bowl with Sylvester Stallone 's mother , who is the psychic consultant to a certain Mr. Chrisian , the club owner 's brother-in-law . Mr. Chrisian is dead . Then we 'll dance in his memory . Sidewalk is all yours . Next . What were we thinking . Club Lust is out of our league . The AV Club is out of our league . You guys want to get inside ? Just ask . I 'll zap you there . It 's not that easy , Lis . That Club Lust would see right through our pathetic efforts to be cool . They 'd chuck us out . We need to be more like them . Sexy , raw , predatory . Real creatures of the night . You want to be cool or be vampires ? You know , vampires are pretty damn cool . I 've never seen a dorky one . You 're not serious , Oh , come on . They have super hearing and super strength . They- - Hypnotic power over women . We could be like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt . Oh , oh , can I be Brad Pitt ? 'Cause you 're my bud . Cool . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Hello ? Aren 't we forgetting the biggie ? Drinking human blood ? Oh . Oh , yeah . Maybe we could skip that part of it . Hm . Skip the blood guzzling . I don 't see why not . You know , once you take the insatiable thirst for helpless victims off the table , it does sound pretty appealing . I want in . She wants in . OK , open your collars . I 've got to get at your necks . Lisa needs a nibble . [ SCREAMING ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Hide your pearly whites . We have entered the cool zone . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Can I get you something from the bar ? Yoo-hoo . OK , relax . Three Yoo-hoos . What was that about ? I haven 't craved a Yoo-hoo in years . Me neither . But right now , I 'd kill for one . I had to replace the blood lust with something . Yoo-hoo lust ? It 's chocolatey good . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Come on , Wy . The dance floor is calling . Oh , I 've never felt so alive . Now that my thirst has been slaked , I need to prowl the night like the creature I 've become . Uh , Wyatt ? Little mustache . You want to come with us ? No , go ahead . I 'm going solo tonight . I 've got my ultra-sensitive bat-like radar set for beefcake . Gary . Gary , two o 'clock . You see her ? Oh , yeah . What are you waiting for ? Go ask her to dance . I can 't dance . You 've seen me . I move like the San Diego chicken . That was then . Now you move like a vampire . Wow . This is better than rollerblading . Hi . You wanna dance ? Uh , Wyatt . What 's yours ? Thanks , I 'd love to . You want to dance ? Annabelle . Hello , ladies . Which one of you feels lucky ? We 'd be lucky if you were in a different club . You don 't think I 'm sexy ? I think whatever you want me to think . Now this is a wish . Hi , can I get a- - No , wait . Let me guess . I 'm good at this . I 'd say you are a definite sex on the beach girl . I am not . It 's a drink . A drink . I know it 's a drink . Don 't have to tell me it 's a drink . I drink ' em all the time . Nothing like a little sex on the beach at the end of a hard day , I always say . Yep , that 's what I always say . If you 've said it once , you 've said it a hundred times , I 'll bet . Well , maybe not a hundred . Aha . Willem . Lisa . You 're fantastic out there . You seem to glide . No , I think they just waxed the floor . Ouch . Oh , sorry . Uh , chipped tooth . You know , you 've got a great smile . It 's like you 've got a secret . I feel the same way about you . Will I see you tomorrow night ? Definitely . I don 't know about you , but I am digging this hypnotizing thing . [ GROANING ] Eh , wet shoulders . Small price to pay . We need to bolt soon . We should get some sleep before our trig quiz tomorrow morning ? Sleep ? We 're the undead now . We can stay up all night and still ace that quiz . Sleep is for mortals . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Two failed midterms . Sleeping through class . Barricading himself in the darkroom ? Tardy ? I hear a cry for help . What are you looking at , you big hangnail ? I 'm looking at you , corny . Toe . Jam . Fungus farm . Let 's get ' em , guys . [ PHONE RINGING ] Hello . Well , if it isn 't my old enemy ass-istant Principal Scampi . Scampi . Scampi . We don 't have time for that right now , Chester . I 'm calling about your brother , Wyatt . I need to set up a parent-teacher conference . No can do . My parents bugged out for the week . I 'm in charge . Well , while you 've been in charge , young Wyatt has run amok . I 'm hardly surprised , what with his well-being entrusted to a boob like you . Boob ? Let 's be honest , Chester . I wouldn 't leave you in charge of dead sea monkeys . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Parent-teacher conference . You . Me . Now . Sit down , Chester . If you don 't mind , I 'd rather stand . Look , we both know that we 'd rather suck all the snot out of a dog 's head than be in the same room with each other . But I 'm here for my brother , so let 's get to it . Let 's look at the facts . His schoolwork is slipping . He 's dressing like a hoodlum . He 's sleeping through his classes . Yeah . Well , now that you mention it , he hasn 't come home one night this week . Sounds like our boy wants to party all the time . Party all the time ? Party all the time . I hear they 've been hanging out at a place called Club Lust . I 'm going in alone . Like hell you are . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Hey guys , Annabelle wants to know if we want to check out the VIP room . It 's an all-night rave called The Tomb . You 'll love it . We can hang out with our kind of people . Our kind of people ? The hardcore social elite . We 're going to The Tomb . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to The Tomb . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Woah . Check us out . We are too hot . [ LIGHT MOANING ] Would you excuse me a sec ? Can you check my hair ? What did you do to it ? I don 't have a reflection , remember ? I had to mousse by memory . Settle a bet for me . What 's that . Gary says you 're over 21 . I say you 're not . How old are you ? 608 . I guess Gary wins . Excuse me . Two admissions , my good man . The redneck bar 's two blocks west . Oh , redneck . I get it , ' cause you think I- - wow , really got me , pal . Zing . You might want to turn away . Oh ! Wanna check out redneck bar ? You know , if I shaved 100 pounds off you and replaced that receding hairline with a disfiguring case of acne , I swear I 'd be looking at Timmy Wizcowski . Assistant Principal Scampi . That 's Principal Scampi now . A position which affords me complete access to the yearbook photo archives . You know , I bet your with-it friends here at Club Lust would get a big kick out of seeing the woofer you took to the junior prom . [ GRUNTING ] [ GONG SOUNDING ] [ PIG OINKING ] Oh , look ! Piggie . What 's going on ? You 'll see . Just a little something we do for newcomers . [ HISSING ] Feed . Feed . Feed . Feed . Feed . Feed . They want us to feed the pig ? I 've got beer nuts . No . They want us to feed on the pig . Feed . They want us to eat Babe ? No way . I mean , maybe if they grease him up and chase him around or something . They are vampires . Wyatt ? What 's the matter with you ? There 's nothing the matter with me . What 's the matter is you . You 're a bloodsucking vampire . So are you . No . No , I 'm a Yoo-hoo sucking vampire . Big difference . You 're joking , right ? I am too terrified to joke . Lis , would you get us out of here please ? Way ahead of you . I don 't understand any of this . I 'll explain it later . Perhaps you 'd better explain it now . Willem , not you too . [ OMINOUS SOUNDS ] Oh , bugger . [ HISSING ] [ SCREAMING ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Any luck ? Nothing . I think I 'm onto something . What have you got ? A lead . Let 's have it . VIP room downstairs . Let 's go . Stay close . Stay inconspicuous . So sweet , lovable old Willy the bartender is really a vampire king ? Vampire lord actually . Annabelle , help us . As if . But I thought you liked me . I don 't date guys with pulses . Why are you playing with these mortals ? Let 's drain them . It 's almost dawn . Don 't dismiss this particular mortal so quickly . A vampire with her powers could douse the sun and plunge the earth into eternal darkness . This entire planet will become a 24-hour all-you-can-eat buffet . Great . An upwardly mobile vampire . It 's settled . We keep the girl , we kill the boys . Drain ' em if you got ' em . [ ELEVATOR WHIRRING ] Oh , good . Second helpings . They 're vampires . Run ! Wyatt , you 're out of control . It 's time for a meeting with the board of education . [ OMINOUS MUSIC ] [ PIG SQUEALING ] Damnit , they 're getting away ! They 're not going anywhere . Why don 't you pay them a little visit . It 's not working , man . We 're in a pretty pile of stink now . Is this silly door supposed to stop me ? She 's getting in ! [ ANNABELLE SCREAMING ] [ BANGING ON DOOR ] Those doors aren 't going to hold . We need some vampire weapons , and we need some fast ! Garlic . We 're trapped in an elevator . Where are we going to find garlic ? I smell garlic . Oh , that 's me . Italian hoagie . I figured it 'd be a long night . Great . Um , what about wooden stakes ? No educator worth his salt is ever without a box of freshly-sharpened Ticonderoga Number 2 's . And I 've got old Lucille here . I remember back in 1987 I predicted that cursed wrist rocket would put out an eye . Tonight , I pray to God I was right . Let 's do some damage . [ BANGING ON DOOR ] [ SCATTERED SCREAMS ] Watch out . They 're pointy . Time for a little gothic shish kabob . Darling , they annoy me . Make their heads explode . Okey dokey . Lisa , we 're your friends . Zap Willem . Okey dokey . Battle of wills . Charming . You 've got him . I got him . Ow , my eye ! [ GROANING ] My eye . Well , I think we know who stands vindicated now . That 's it . The windows ! [ GROANING ] Wait til tonight , all of you . As soon as darkness falls , I 'll be paying you all a little visit . And I will suck you dry . Hey pucky , suck on this . [ EVIL SCREAMING ] Ow . Major migraine . Where 's Willem ? Uh , sorry Lis . I thought I 'd finally met a nice guy . Funny , handsome , charming . Now he 's gone , and I never really had a chance to say goodbye . Goodbye , jerk . There . Closure . [ OMINOUS SOUNDS ] Well , scratched that nest of undead scum off our hit list . You were a dead eye with those Number 2 's . There was nothing holy about the way you sprayed that holy water . You think there 's any more out there ? Only the night will tell . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ THEME MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different . We 're making weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , I do not know . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

 Quiet ! Quiet ! Listen to me . It was a terrible thing . You are not going to believe me , even when I tell you . Some say it is a story , a fairy tale . But I saw it . I saw it with my own eyes . Quiero hombres fuertes . Rápido ! Oye , mi amor . - Pértate bien . - Tu también . Pues clam . Gracias . No . Let 's go ! Maria ! Eso es segum . Las cabras . Maria ! Maria ! Maria ! Maria ! Madre de Dios . Mulder , this happened how long ago ? Tres dias , muy incredible , no ? Only the smell . You brought me out here under the pretense of investigating an unexplained death . Can you tell me why we 're standing out here looking at a dead goat ? According to eyewitnesses , the death was preceded by a fortean event : a highly unusual or infrequent meteorological phenomenon ... - .. also known as a transient . - A transient ? Witnesses described a bright ﬂash about 30 degrees off the horizon . A hot , yellow rain fell from a cloudless sky . Fortean researchers call these liquid falls . Black and red rains are common , but there have also been blue. purple and green rains . - Purple rain ? - Yeah . Great album . Deeply ﬂawed movie , though . Mulder , this transient , as you call it , ... .. this bright ﬂash in the sky - I assume you think it has some connection to ... Fortean events have been linked to alien encounters . Cattle mutilations . The kind of exsanguinated animal carcass you were looking at . The victim , Maria Dorantes - did she die in a similar fashion ? - I would assume so . - You assume ? - Nobody 's examined the body ? - Nobody cares . Scully . The victim and many of the witnesses are illegal immigrants , migrant farm workers . I thought it might be important to talk to them before they migrated . No , no . No la migra . No la migra . No la migra . We 're FBI . No la migra . It 's all right . We don 't wanna take anybody away . Relax . No , it 's OK . What do you want ? We wanna know what happened to Maria Dorantes . Does anybody know what happened to Maria Dorantes ? Did anybody see anything ? El Chupacabra . That 's what happened to Maria Dorantes . - El Chupacabra ? - Yeah. it 's a Mexican folk tale . El Chupacabra. the goat-sucker : a small , grey creature ... .. with a big head and a small body and big , black bulging eyes . Si , si , si . Light , then rain . Then El Chupacabra , it comes and eats away Maria 's eyes and face . - Did you see the Chupacabra ? - No . But everyone here knows that this is the truth . This woman 's a liar . There is no Chupacabra . It 's nothing but a story told to children . I know the killer of Maria Dorantes . - Who would that be , sir ? - It 's my brother . Eladio Buente . He killed Maria because she loved only me . How do you explain the yellow rain then , and the dead goat over the hill ? It is a trick ... for fools who believe in fool superstitions . Thank you , Mr Buente . You 've been very helpful . " Maria , Maria . " " I 've just met a girl named Maria . " - Doesn 't make a whole lot of sense , Scully . - Makes perfect sense . Admit it , you fell for it . Your fortean event turned out to be nothing more than the oldest story in the world . Two men , one woman , trouble . I admit there 's a strong suspicion of motive and intent . But the detail , the description of that Chupacabra . Mulder , what we 've walked into here is a Mexican soap opera , one for the local cops . Local cops don 't care , Scully . I don 't know who does . OK , I care , but what are we supposed to do about it ? Find out what killed Maria Dorantes . Take a look at her body . - While you do what ? - Try to ﬁnd this man , Eladio Buente . Agent Lozano ? Special Agent Mulder . I 'm with the FBI . The FBI ? Here ? We 're investigating the death of a migrant worker . Really ? Eladio Buente . He hasn 't been seen for three days , and he 's not in police custody . - I thought he might be in INS custody . - He might . Let 's see . 0K , we have a José Feliciano . We have Juan Valdez . We have César Chavez . We have Placido Domingo here . But I don 't see any Eladio Buente . So you are telling me that no one here uses their real name . - What is this man wanted for ? - Possibly the murder of Maria Dorantes . Oh , man . The Chupacabra ? Yeah . You 've heard of it . You don 't believe it . No , I believe these people . Their lives are small . So they have to make these fantasies just to keep on going , to feel alive . Because they are strangers here . They feel hated , unwanted . When their passions become inflamed they resort to violence ... .. and then they cannot turn to the law so they make up these fantastic tales . Call it anything you want , but this is an age-old story . I 've heard that . Let 's see if we can ﬁnd your Eladio Buente . Excuse me . - Excuse me . - Can I help you ? I 'm Agent Dana Scully with the FBI , investigating the death of a migrant worker . - Juan or Juanita ? - I 'm sorry ? Doe . A man or a woman ? Maria Dorantes . I need to determine a cause of death in order to close an investigation . It sounds vaguely familiar , but I don 't think I 've got to her yet . Well , I 'm a medical doctor . If you show me the body , I could examine it myself . It 's in the fridge . I don 't think he 's going anywhere . That 's her . Oh , my God . This must be him . Why is he segregated like this ? Por qué lo tienes segregado ? Nosotros detenidos lo molestaban mucho . Ninguno se la acerca a él . Le tienen un miedo terrible . The other detainees were giving him a hard time . They don 't wanna go near him . - They think he 's the Chupacabra . - That may be . But I will tell you , with a tremendous degree of certainty , this guy is not Erik Estrada . Buente ! El FBI quiere hacerte unas preguntas . Ask him if he killed Maria Dorantes . Quiere saber si mataste a Maria Dorantes . No ! No lo hice . Soy inocente . No soy asesino ! - What did he say ? - " I didn 't do it . " Ask him what happened . Qué fue lo que pasé ? Un ruido como un relampago muy cerca . There was a noise like thunder , but very close . And then there was lightning , very bright . It blinded me . And I fell to the ground . And then I felt the hot rain fall on me . And when I finally could open my eyes and see , ... .. I saw the dead goat . And then I saw Maria . Maria . She called my name ... once . She was lying in a puddle of yellow rain . Something had eaten at her face . And I held her in my arms , and then she died . And then I got up , and I ran screaming . Soy inocente ! This guy is better than Erik Estrada . What 's gonna happen to him ? He 'll get his 45 seconds before the judge and he 'll be placed on a southbound bus . - Is there any way to delay that ? - Why would you wanna do that ? - To try to solve an unexplained death . - Hasn 't the FBI got better things to do ? File your paperwork . By the time they process it , he 'll probably be back here anyway . Put him in the front . Come on . Up front . OK , vamos . Let 's go . - Did you ﬁnd Eladio Buente ? - Yeah , I found him . Did he confess to the murder of Maria Dorantes ? Not exactly , no . - Did he tell you what happened ? - Flash of light , yellow rain . " Maria ! Maria ! " He didn 't kill her , Mulder . I examined the body of Maria Dorantes ... .. and I believe that her cause of death was natural , albeit strange . She seems to have succumbed to a massive fungal infection . - A fungus ? - Aspergillus , according to the coroner . It 's a mould that 's found in dead leaves , compost , even household dust . - And it can kill ? - Not normally . - It 's very common and quite harmless . - You don 't think that 's weird ? Well , aspergillus can be lethal to people with immunodeficiencies ... .. like AIDS patients and transplant recipients . I found high levels of methyl bromide in her blood workup . It 's a pesticide that 's used for soil sterilization - highly toxic . Now , I think that her body was so ravaged by pesticides ... .. that a normally benign fungus may have compromised her whole immune system . Still doesn 't explain the ﬂash of light and the yellow rain ... .. and El Chupacabra . Mulder , I know you don 't wanna hear this , ... .. but I think the aliens in this story are not the villains , they 're the victims . Look at that . Mulder . What does it look like ? It appears he died of systemic shock , brought on by what appears to be a fungal infection . - The same one that killed Maria Dorantes ? - No , I don 't know what this is . But its speed and aggressiveness are frightening . The infection 's covered 90 percent of his body , through both layers of skin . Did you find him ? We rounded up most of the people who escaped . Eladio Buente wasn 't among them . No one knows where he ran ? Agent Lozano , this is my partner , Agent Scully . They all ran away from El Chupacabra , the man they say is responsible for this tragedy . - Eladio Buente didn 't kill anybody . - I 'm not so sure about that , Scully . This is the work of a pathogen of some kind of a highly virulent strain . Right now Eladio Buente is the only connection we have to this death ... .. and to the death of Maria Dorantes. which is why I need manpower to try to find him . Manpower ? We don 't have the resources to go chasing after one poor illegal . Whatever you hope to learn by finding him , we have to first make a classification ... .. of the fungi from the victims . I need to isolate it , and I need to get a sample to a mycologist as quickly as possible . Good . You should do that while Agent Lozano and I try to ﬁnd El Chupacabra . Te molesta que te vea asi . No es cierto ? Por qué habia de molestarme ? - Soy tu mujer . - Si , te molesta . Senor ? - Senor ? - What do you want ? You wanna go back ? Estas loco ? We haul mucha basura with that truck . What makes you think we haul it back ? How long have you been in this country ? Ni credito , ni caridad . Aqui es America , you dumb wet . Truck stop at dusk . No dinero , no ride . Comprende ? Si . - Dinero . - Dinero . Construction ! Construction workers . Dos . OK . You two , get in the back . Let 's go . I only need two , amigo . Dos . Hey , outta the truck . I got work to do . Hey ! Where are you going ? You 'll have to do . What you 're looking at is the most ubiquitous fungal spore known to mankind : dermatophytosis . Athlete 's foot ? A great survivor of countless extermination efforts . Historically underrated and unfairly overshadowed by the popular cockroach . But our body has natural defences against this kind of invasion . I mean , even in the absence of an immunoresponse , ... .. a fungi like this one or the aspergillus , don 't they need the right environment to multiply ? Yes , unless they have help . What 's this ? It 's an enzyme I isolated from both your specimens , but that 's about all I can tell you . - It 's unlike any enzyme I 've ever seen . - It 's not the fungi but the enzyme that kills . Acting as a catalyst , as an accelerant . Let me show you . This is Puccinia graminis . Black stern rust . It 's been the cause of a fairly containable crop blight here in the valley . Oh , my God . I must say , if this were to get out into the environment ... .. dermatophytosis might give the cockroach a run for its money . Hm ? He was here , all right . They say he got into the truck of a foreman named Culver . Story 's out . Oh , yeah . I told you , these people love their stories . It 's the one thing that keeps them from going mad when they 're out there waiting for work . So they really don 't think he 's the Chupacabra ? No , they 're certain of it . - You told them about the fungal infection ? - They wouldn 't listen . They are only interested in what will become of Eladio Buente . - What will become of him ? - When his brother ﬁnds him ... - He 'll kill him . - Yes , probably . A man cannot live with vengeance in his heart . So we gotta find him first . My mother used to say that blood should be left to cleanse itself . God curses the man who stands between two brothers . Well , in this case , he 'll curse the man who doesn 't . Senor ? Senor ? Jefe . Senor Culver ? Jefe ! Jefe ! Eladio Buente . Eladio ? Eladio Buente . Matame a mi . Asesino ! Gabrielle ! Gabrielle ! Gabrielle , por favor . Eladio ! - Mulder , it 's me . - Where are you ? The state university bio department . Mulder , listen to me . I think you 're right . I think Eladio Buente is responsible for those deaths . - Responsible how ? - By spreading an enzyme produced by ... .. what appears to be a new strain of conidial fungi . - How 's he spreading it ? - My guess is by touch . I saw this man , Scully . He was unaffected . He could be just a carrier then , a kind of Typhoid Mary . - You 're saying it 's a new strain ? - Yes . Mulder , it is extremely important that you not come into direct contact with this fungus . - You must not inhale it , touch it . - Lozano , careful . Scully , I 've been thinking . I know that 's dangerous , but just bear with me . These fortean transients - what the women described - they could have been caused by an object falling at a high speed ... .. creating a sonic boom and a ﬂash of light , what astronomers call a bolide . A bolide ? Created by a meteorite or a piece of extra-planetary material ... .. of which 2,000 tons fall to the earth every day . This yellow rain - the space debris could have fallen in a lake ... .. super heating the water and sending it Skyward , which would mean this is alien . I think this is beside the point right now . - And the fungus ... - Let me work on the fungus . What you need to do right now is to find the man who may be spreading it . OK . So you got your own stories too , huh ? Hey , it 's El Barbero . Hey . Lozano , I hear you 're lookin ' for the Chupacabra . For a modest fee , I can tell you where he might be found . Eladio ! Stop ! Don 't touch him . Hey ! I lost him . Oh ! More goats . Agent Lozano . How does this man keep eluding us ? These people are invisible . You look at them and you don 't see them . Just workers , cheap labour to pick crops and clean houses . To most people , they 're aliens in the true sense of the word . - El Chupacabra . - Calm down . Calm down . Can a man do this ? Can Eladio Buente do this ? Eladio , he went to his cousin Gabriella 's house asking for money . - When ? - Today . He said he killed nobody . But Soledad , he went to Gabrielle 's house trying to kill Eladio . Calm down . - Quién es ? - Gabrielle Buente ? This is Agent Lozano , INS . Open up . - Where is he ? - 6 ' Que ' ? Don 't give me your " que " . You know who . - Where is he - Eladio ? - He is not here . Please , I would not let Eladio Buente in here . You must believe me . Maybe you should check the back . - What about his brother , Soledad ? - No , He is not here ! No one is here ! I 'm alone . Have you seen either of them ? Si . But I 'm afraid because of what they say about Eladio . - About El Chupacabra . - There is no El Chupacabra , Gabrielle . Eladio is a very sick man . If he comes here , you must not let him in . If he comes to this door , call the police . Understand ? There 's nobody . I 'm gonna be watching you , Chiquita . Every move . - Comprendes ? - Si . - I think we should hold up a minute . - For what ? Something 's going on here . Hey , José , this ain 't no restaurant ! You know you have to pay for all that . Hey , what the hell do you think you 're doing ? Come back here ! Hey , you 're gonna have to clean that up . Hey ! - That 's our man . - Eladio Buente ? No . That 's his brother - Soledad . - Bueno . - Eladio ? Si , Gabrielle . Eladio ? Eladio ! Soledad Buente . Stop ! Stop ! - Drop your weapon ! - Drop the gun ! - Put it down ! Now ! - Drop it ! Suéltala ! solo quiere vengarme . - Eladio ! - Callate . - Callate la boca . - Mulder . He 's been here . - Quién es ? - Eladio . Eladio ? Eladio ? Eladio Buente ? He is not here . He 's gone . - Gone where ? - To Mexico . - Where he can hide his terrible face . - How 's he gonna get to Mexico ? - I gave him all my money . - You gave him your money ? Yes , because I was afraid . I was afraid El Chupacabra would kill me too . What can I say ? - How are we gonna find this man ? - Good luck . I 'm gonna go process the brother . You know what she said about Eladio , about his face ... I don 't know what to believe any more . These people sure love their stories . He could be anywhere . If he were to enter a metropolitan area with what he 's carrying ... - He won 't . - If he 's going to Mexico ... She 's lying . If this man thinks he killed Maria Dorantes , he won 't be going to Mexico . Then where is he going ? Same place as Lozano and Eladio 's brother . - He 's gone to face his brother . - I don 't understand . " God curses the man who stands between two brothers . " Get on your cell phone and have a haz-mat team assembled . Eladio Buente , come on out ! Be a man and face your brother . Madre de Dios . Eladio , no ! Parate Eladio ! They came from the sky . More Chupacabras ... I slammed the door and prayed ... that they would not come to kill me too . - What will happen to Soledad ? - He was taken up by a Chupacabra . He will suffer for his treachery . He is made to suck the blood ... .. of only the sick and dying goats when the Chupacabra comes to feed . That 's not what Gabriella said . What does Gabriella know ? I was there . I saw it with my own eyes . Gabriella said that she lied to la FBI , so that her cousin Eladio might live . But la migra Lozano knew that Soledad could not live with vengeance in his heart . Alta ! Turn around and face the man whose love you killed ! You killed Maria because she wouldn 't love you . Because her heart belongs to only one man . Don 't make me shoot you in the back , Eladio ! Turn ! See my tears ! - Turn around like a man ! - No . " Shoot . Shoot ! " la migra shouted . But Soledad began to cry . " No . No ! " cried Soledad . " I cannot shoot my brother . He is my brother . My ﬂesh , my blood . " - Shoot him ! He 's El Chupacabra ! - Shouted la migra . You cannot let him go ! " He is a goat-sucker and he must be killed ! " Soledad , he could not kill Eladio ... .. because he knew I would never forgive him . La migra Lozano tried to pull the gun from Soledad 's hand , calling him a coward . " No ! " cried Soledad . " He is my brother ! " And the gun went off ! Bang ! Bang ! La migra Lozano ... fell dead . Pero no . La migra Lozano ... .. brought Soledad to kill Eladio ... .. so that he would not be cursed . So God ... .. cursed Soledad for his treachery ... .. and turned him into ... .. El Chupacabra like his brother . No . Together they run ... .. to Mexico . - El Chupacabra ? - Yes , sir . - Frankly , I 'm confused by this story . - I don 't blame you . We can 't exactly explain it ourselves , sir . At any rate , we arrived just after the haz-mat team . They established a perimeter then secured the area . An eyewitness was found , but her testimony was questionable . The haz-mat team were able to contain the fungal infection within the camp . No other casualties were reported ... .. and we found no other traces of the accelerating enzyme . Except on Agent Lozano . We found him dead with a bullet wound to the chest With the fungal infection already starting to eat away at him . - What happened to the brothers ? - They were nowhere to be found . Lozano 's revolver turned up ten miles away ... .. near the car of a man known locally as El Barbera . Apparently , the brothers paid this man for a ride to Mexico ... .. but they didn 't get very far . So these men are still at large carrying a highly contagious fungus ... - .. that can kill a man in his tracks ? - It 's not a fungus , sir . It 's an enzyme to which the brothers had an abnormal tolerance ... .. and which came from what I believe to be an anti-enzyme gene . - And this enzyme came from where ? - Outer space , sir . This is the story you 're asking me to report ? .. we 'd be able to find these men . Why hasn 't this happened ? Well , sir , they , um ... .. they have a way of ... being almost invisible . The truth is , ... .. nobody cares . I made this !

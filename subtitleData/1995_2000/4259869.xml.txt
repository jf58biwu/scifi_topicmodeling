( CLOCK CHIMING ) ( PIANO MUSIC GROWS LOUDER ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) Dr. Malcolm ! IAN : Oh , my God . Hello , Dr. Malcolm . Kids , kids . It 's so great to see you . It 's so great to see you . It 's so great . Look at you . You came to see Grandpa ? Yeah , he called me . Do you know what it 's about ? I don 't , either . This joint 's kind of creepy , isn 't it ? Is everything okay ? Well , not exactly . ( FOOTSTEPS ) ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Dr. Malcolm . Dr. Malcolm . Here to share a few campfire stories with my uncle ? IAN : You can convince The Washington Post and Skeptical Inquirer of what you want but I was there . I know what happened and so do you . Do you actually believe that everyone who chose discretion did so for a nefarious motive ? Even Lex and Tim ? IAN : Leave them out of it . It 's not a game . No . You signed a nondisclosure agreement before you went to the island that forbade you from discussing what you saw . You violated that agreement . I did . And you lied about the deaths of three people . You misinformed the public , which made me look like a nut . Hasn 't been so good for my livelihood ... We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries . A payoff and an insult . When you spin reality , cover up evidence , it hurts more than my reputation . As I recall , your university revoked your tenure for your selling wild stories to the press . I didn 't sell anything . I never took a cent , and I told the truth . Your version of it . There aren 't " versions " of the truth . InGen can 't keep spewing out ... InGen is my responsibility now . I will jealously defend its interests . IAN : Your responsibility ? What about Mr. Hammond ? It is our board of directors I must face , not my uncle . Trust me , your problems are about to be rendered moot . LUDLOW : In a few weeks ' time , they 'll be long forgotten . Not by me . Careful . This suit cost more than your education . HAMMOND : You were right and I was wrong . There ! Did you ever expect to hear me say such a thing ? Thank God for Site B. Site B ? Isla Nublar was just a showroom , something for the tourists . Site B was the factory floor . That was on Isla Sorna , 80 miles from Nublar . We bred the animals there , and nurtured them for a few months , then moved them into the park . Really ? I did not know that . After the accident in the park , Hurricane Clarissa wiped out our facility on Site B. Call it an act of God . We had to evacuate . The animals were released to mature on their own . " Life will find a way , " as you once so eloquently put it . By now we have a complete ecological system on the island with dozens of species living in their own social groups without fences , boundaries , or constraining technology . And for four years I 've tried to keep it safe from human interference . That 's right . Hopefully , you 've kept the island quarantined and contained . But I 'm in shock about all this . I mean , that they 're still alive . You bred them lysine-deficient . Shouldn 't they have kicked after seven days without supplemental enzymes ? Yes ! But , by God , they 're flourishing . That 's one of 1,000 questions I want the team to answer . Team ? Yes . I 've organized an expedition to go in , thank you , and document them . To make the most spectacular living fossil record the world has ever seen . Go in and document ? You mean with people ? Yes , the animals won 't know they 're there . Very low impact . Strictly observation and documentation . HAMMOND : Our satellite infrareds show the animals are fiercely territorial . The carnivores are isolated in the interior of the island so the team can stay on the outer rim . Don 't worry . I 'm not making the same mistakes again . No , you 're making all new ones . John ! So , there 's another island with dinosaurs , no fences this time , and you want to send people in , very few people , on the ground , right ? Who are the four lunatics you 're trying to con into this ? It was difficult to convince them as to what they would see , in the end had to use my checkbook to get them there . But there 's Nick Van Owen , who is a video documentarian , Eddie Carr , who 's a field equipment expert . We have our paleontologist and I was hoping that perhaps you might be the fourth . We 've been on the verge of Chapter 11 ever since that accident in the park . There are those in the company who wanted to exploit Site B in order to bail us out . They 've been planning it for years , and I 've been able to stop them until now . But , a few weeks ago , a British family on a yacht cruise stumbled across the island and their wee girl was injured . She 's fine . But the board has used the incident to take control of InGen from me . Now it 's only a matter of time before this lost world is found and pillaged . Public opinion is the one thing I can use to preserve it , but to rally that support I need a complete photo record of those animals alive and in their natural habitat . So you went from capitalist to naturalist in just four years . That 's something . It 's our last chance at redemption . John , no . Of course , no . And I 'm going to contact the other three members of your team and stop them from going . Who 's the paleontologist , by the way ? She came to me , I want you to know this . Who did ? Leave it to you , Ian , to have associations , affiliations , even liaisons , with the best people in so many fields . Not Sarah . Paleontological behavior study is a new field , and Sarah Harding is on that frontier . Her theories on parenting and nurturing amongst carnivores have framed the debate . What are you doing ? Where 's your phone ? HAMMOND : It 's too late . She 's already there . ( PHONE BEEPS OFF ) The others are meeting her in three days . You sent my girlfriend to this island alone ? " Sent " is hardly the word . She couldn 't be restrained . She was already working in San Diego , doing some research at the animal park . It 's only a couple of hours ' flight from there . She was adamant , absolutely adamant about , here you are , about making the initial foray by herself . She thinks she 's Dian Fossey . " Observation without interference , " she said . She went on and on . You know how it is . After you were injured in the park , she sought you out . Then she went all the way to a hospital in Costa Rica to ask somebody who she didn 't even know if the rumors were true . If you want to leave your name on something , fine . But stop putting it on other people 's headstones . She 'll be fine . She 's spent years studying African predators . Sleeping downwind and all . She knows what she 's doing . And , believe me , the research team will ... It 's not a research expedition anymore . It 's a rescue operation and it 's leaving now . ( ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) EDDIE : You can 't shave three days off my deadline and expect to be ready . I 'm not supplied . I haven 't tested any of this . IAN : Why give her a satellite phone if it doesn 't work ? Why doesn 't it ? EDDIE : Could be solar flares , the satellite , or maybe she turned it off . EDDIE : I need half air on the tires . We 're flying pressurized . IAN : Does she know how to use it ? EDDIE : You kidding ? She 's faxed me refinements on 50 % of the plans for this stuff . Don 't do that . You got to baby it a little bit . Love it . I 'll love it when it works . It 'll work when you love it . You coming along ? I don 't usually , but I can 't resist . Thanks for the two-minute warning . Nick Van Owen , this is Ian Malcolm . Nick 's our field photographer . IAN : How do you do ? You do wildlife photography ? Wildlife , combat , you name it . When I was with Nightline , I was in Rwanda , Chechnya , Bosnia . I do volunteer work with Greenpeace once in a while . Greenpeace ? What drew you there ? Women . NICK : 80 % female , Greenpeace . Noble . NICK : Noble was last year . This year I 'm getting paid . Hammond 's check cleared , or I wouldn 't go on this wild-goose chase . You 're going to the only place in the world where the geese chase you . You 're going to the only place in the world where the geese chase you . KELLY : Dad ! Dad ! IAN : Kelly , my honey , you found it . What took you so long ? Sorry , I couldn 't get a cab . IAN : Sweetie , that 's okay . Listen , I 've got to tell you something . I 've got to talk to you . I don 't even know this woman . IAN : You 've known Karen for 10 years . She doesn 't even have Sega . She 's such a troglodyte . Cruel , but good word use . KELLY : Why can 't I stay with Sarah ? She 's out of town . Karen 's fantastic . She 'll take you places . You 'll have a fantastic time . Stop saying " fantastic . " Where are you going , anyway ? It 's only for a few days . I wouldn 't be going if it wasn 't really important . I 'm your daughter all the time . You can 't abandon me whenever opportunity knocks . That hurts my feelings . Your mom tell you to say that ? EDDIE : Dr. Malcolm , downstairs , please . I know we 've had some hard going . But in the last few years , we 've started to work things out . Yeah , but crack on me a bit . Ground me or something . Send me to my room . You never do any of that stuff . Why would I ? You turned out so beautiful , brilliant , powerful , funny , and generous . The queen , goddess . My inspiration . EDDIE : Dr. Malcolm . KELLY : I could come be your research assistant , like I was in Austin . This is nothing like Austin . Anyway , you have your own stuff . Your gymnastics competition . You 've been training for months . Gymnastics ? I scrubbed out , Dad , I got cut from the team . Thanks for knowing . I 'm sorry , honey . I know how much that meant to you . You like to have kids . But you just don 't want to be with them , do you ? It wasn 't me who dumped you and split for Paris , so don 't take it out on me . EDDIE : Dr. Malcolm , downstairs ! Honey , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You want some good parental advice ? Don 't listen to me . MAN : How are we doing here ? ( MEN CHATTERING ) The specs say it can 't deform at 1 2,000 PSI , so we just have to test it . Let 's clear . Are we clear ? What 's this ? A High Hide . A High Hide . You know , you go up and hide , high . It goes up to where the trees are and keeps the researchers out of harm 's way . Actually , it puts them at a very convenient biting height . What 's the time ? Do you have the time ? Do I have the time ? Why ? We 're leaving in three hours . This is so cool . ( OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC INTENSIFIES ) Lindstradt air rifle . Fires a subsonic Fluger impact delivery dart . It works better than your satellite phone ? That 's funny . I loaded it with the enhanced venom of Conus Purpurascens , South Sea cone shell . Most powerful neurotoxin in the world . Acts within 0.002 of a second . Which is faster than the nerve-conduction velocity . So the animal 's down before it even feels the prick of the dart . Is there an antidote ? Like if you shot yourself in the foot ? Don 't do that . You 'd be dead before you even realized you had an accident . ( SPEAKING SPANISH ANGRILY ) He says he 's unloading us here . He won 't go further up the river . He 's heard too many stories about this island chain . He 'll drop us off and anchor offshore . What kind of stories ?

( SPEAKING SPANISH ) When you need him , call and he 'll be here in two hours . But he will not stay here . ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) He won 't stay anywhere near these islands .

( OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) EDDIE : I put a location sensor in Dr. Harding 's phone , so we should get a reading . IAN : I 'm so relieved .

Yeah . " Ooh , ah , " that 's how it always starts . But then later there 's running and screaming . Wow . Nick ! ( LAUGHING ) I guess you got the jump on us , didn 't you , Sarah ? SARAH : Yeah . ( SARAH STOPS LAUGHING ) Ian , I never thought in a million years Hammond could get you to come here . SARAH : Hi , Eddie . Hi , Sarah . Got a granola bar or something ? I 'm starving . Did you see those animals ? A family group , a pair-bond and a sub-adult , long after the juvenile was nest bound . Every egg clutch I 've seen has crushed , trampled shells . Hatchlings stay in the birth environment a long time . That 's conclusive . I can put that controversy to rest if I get a shot of the nest . Have you been attacked ? No , that 's my lucky pack . That 's how it always looks . Okay , Sarah ... SARAH : Is that a Nikon ? Can I borrow that ? I 'll be right back , baby , I promise . IAN : When Hammond called you , why didn 't you say something to me ? I knew you would have stopped me from coming . IAN : I would have tied you to the bed . I know how they survived without lysine . I don 't care . The herbivore species that are thriving eat mostly agama beans , soy , anything lysine-rich . ( GROWLING ) And the carnivores eat the herbivores , so ... Wait . Stay there . Be quiet . I 'll be right back . No ! Stay there . ( STEGOSAURUS HOWLING ) ( STEGOSAURUS GRUNTING ) IAN : She 's much too close . What the hell is she doing ? Too close .

These images are incredible . Legendary . Guys shoot their whole life , they never get stuff half this good . Just give me the Pulitzer right now . Today , please . The competition 's over , close the entries , I 'd like to thank everyone who lost . SARAH : Don 't light that ! Dinosaurs pick up scents from miles away . We 're here to observe and document , not interact . IAN : Which , by the way , is a scientific impossibility . Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle . What you study , you also change . SARAH : I 'll risk it . I 'm sick of scratching around in rock and bone making assumptions and deductions about the nurturing habits of animals that have been dead for 65 million years . I 'm sick of it , man . Then you fill my head with stories for four years . Of course I came down here . IAN : Stories of mutilation and death . Weren 't you paying attention ? SARAH : Please ! Don 't treat me like I 'm a grad student . I 've worked around predators since I was 20 years old . Lions , jackals , hyenas , you . ( WILD SQUAWKING AND CHIRPING ) Where 's the fire ? I 'm trying to change 100 years of entrenched dogma . Dinosaurs were characterized very early on as vicious lizards . There 's great resistance to the idea of them as nurturing parents . Robert Burke said the T. Rex was a rogue who abandoned its young at the earliest opportunity . I can prove otherwise . Fire ! Dr. Malcolm , fire , base camp ! SARAH : No ! Water makes the smoke billow . Use dirt ! Who started the fire ? I just wanted to make dinner . I wanted it ready when you guys got back . Do you see any family resemblance there ? You practically told me to come here . I ... What ? You said , " Don 't listen to me . " I thought you were trying to tell me something . Kelly , you knew exactly what I meant . You have no ... You want to lock her up for her curiosity ? Where do you think she gets it ? KELLY : Thank you , Sarah . IAN : Don 't start the teaming-up thing . Out of the conversation . Please . Really . Eddie ? What ? Why in the hell doesn 't this thing ever work ? It 's not a landline . You 're not in a phone booth . You got to wait for a decent signal . Violence and technology , not good bedfellows . Hammond wants your equipment as close to the animals as possible . Great idea . And why don 't you smear on a little sheep 's blood ? Eddie , is there any reason to think the radio in the trailer might work ? Don 't tease me . If you feel qualified , try flicking the switch to " on . " Okay , I 'm taking my daughter out of here . Anyone coming with me , this is your last chance to get out . When you 're out in the field ... Nick , if you 're staying , I 'll gladly deliver a letter to your wife or loved one so you can say goodbye . Eddie , if you have any personal effects it 's the least I can do . I 'll be in there , guys . Our presence needs to be 100 % antiseptic . If we so much as bend a blade of grass ... Dad , are you mad ? No , I 'm not mad . I 'm furious . What is this ? This looks like your room . I was going to clean it up . Right now . What is this ? There are 100 switches ! Don 't be mad . I was going to call to let you know where I was . I always do , don 't I ? I 'm the best kind of girlfriend there is . One who travels a lot . You like that , right ? You love your independence . I 've gotten used to being apart , but that 's not how I want to live . Kelly , this is tall talk . Just for a minute . It 's like a height restriction at an amusement park . If you wanted to rescue me , why didn 't you bail me out from that museum fundraiser three weeks ago , like you said you would ? This is a slightly different situation . What about the dinner with your parents you never showed up for ? Why not rescue me when I really need it ? Be there when you say you will ? I have made a career out of waiting for you . You know , Sarah has a pretty good ... It 's so important to your future that you not finish that sentence . Please , outside ! Ian , come on . Look . I love that you rode in here on a white horse . I really do . It 's very touching , very dramatic . I just need you to show up in a cab every once in a while , too . What are you doing ? Don 't go out there . It 's not safe . Stay in here . Come back . Shut the door . Okay . I know what I 'm doing . You guys should definitely go . But I 'm going to stay . I love you . I just don 't need you right now . What you need is a good anti-psychotic . I 'll be back in five or six days . No , you 'll be back in five or six pieces . What bothers you is that I 'm not afraid of this place , and you are . IAN : Of course I am . That 's the whole thing . All I want is ... IAN : Of course I am . That 's the whole thing . All I want is ... What 's that sound ? ( RUMBLING ) IAN : Here we go . I 'll get you out on one of these , now . Hello ! Over here ! I don 't get it . It says ingen on the side of that chopper ! I don 't get that . Why would Hammond send two teams ? KELLY : Cut the umbilical , Dad ! Doesn 't he trust us ? We haven 't even started . PETER : This is as good a place as any for base camp . That 's first priority after we 're finished . I want it up and running in 30 minutes . That 's half an hour . Understood ? Over . Cancel that order . What ? Why ? This is a game trail , Mr. Ludlow . Carnivores hunt on game trails . You want to set up base camp or a buffet ? Let 's find a new spot , shall we ? Over and out . Peter , if I run your little camping trip , there are two conditions . First , I 'm in charge . If I 'm not around , Dieter is . You just pay us , tell us we 're doing well , and serve us Scotch after a good day . Second condition , my fee . You can keep it . All I want for my services , is the right to hunt a tyrannosaurus . A male . A buck only . How and why are my business . If you don 't like those conditions , you 're on your own . So go ahead , set up base camp here , in a swamp , or in the middle of a Rex nest for all I care . I 've had too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas . Okay ? Okay . Cycle , break off the stray from the herd and flush him to the right . Snaggers , stay ready . He 's bringing them out to you . It 'll be a Pachy ... Pachya ... Oh , hell . The fat head with the bald spot . Friar Tuck . ( ROARING ) Stop . Pachycephalosaurus . Carnivore ? No , herbivore , late Cretaceous . ( ROARING ) See the distinctive domed skull ? Nine inches of solid bone . Now , careful . See , the Pachy 's neck attaches at the bottom of its skull , not at the back of its head . When it lowers its head , its neck lines up with its backbone , which is perfect for absorbing impact . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Snagger , Friar Tuck 's on the loose , just about to cross your path .

Infant 's probably only a couple weeks old . Never left the nest . Offspring that young , the parents won 't leave him alone for too long . AJAY : Make your blind here , wait for the buck to return . No . If the nest is upwind , then so are we . When he comes back , he 's gonna know we 're here without us having a chance . The trick is to get him to come where we want him . ( HOWLING IN PAIN ) ( HOWLING CONTINUES ) This is why Hammond was in a hurry to get you here . He knew they were coming . My God , they are well-organized . Those are some major-league toys . IAN : Maybe I should ask to use their phone . Their dish is bigger than yours . So they actually want to build another park here ? After what you said happened on the other island ? They 're not building anything . They 're taking these animals out of here . Back to the mainland . I think I should tell you . Hammond told me these people might show up . He thought we 'd be finished by the time they started , but if they weren 't he sent a backup plan . What backup plan ? Me . LUDLOW : InGen is seeking limited partners to defray some of our expenses . LUDLOW : The prospectus you 've been given by the board details our projected hardware and construction expenses . As you can see by my two friends here , the software is already fully developed . One might say , " It 'd be up and running .

Before he ever dreamt of an island he began construction on an amphitheatre very near to where you 're sitting now , the ingen Waterfront Complex . But he abandoned it in favor of something far grander and ultimately impossible . And so , the facility sits unused , unfinished , when it could be completed and ready to receive visitors in less than a month .

Quick injection of antibiotics and he 's out of here . ( PHONE RINGING ) For once in your life , would it kill you to pick it up ? Help me get it out of here . No , we just set its leg . ( EARTH-SHAKING REX FOOTSTEP ) Mommy 's very angry . ( REX ROARING ) ( ALL PANTING IN TERROR ) This isn 't hunting behavior , Ian . They 're searching . They came for their infant . Let 's not disappoint them . Let me get his head , okay ? Careful . Be careful . SARAH : I got him . NICK : Muzzle off . ( GROWLING AND ROARING CONTINUES ) ( PHONE RINGING ) IAN : Yes , Eddie ? They 're going back to the jungle . IAN : I know . I see . How 's Kelly ? She 's fine . She 's right here . Hello ? Kelly , are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm good . Stay there . Don 't move . I 'll be right back up . Understand ? Yeah , I understand . ( PANTING ) I beg people to listen to me . I use plain , simple English . Shut up . That should make an interesting chapter in your book . The debate over the parental instincts of the T. Rex is now academic . Hang on . This is gonna be bad . ( ALL YELLING ) ( REX ROARING ) They 're pushing us over the cliff . Oh , my God . Come on , come on . Once we 're out of here ... Into the woods . Straight into the woods . Come on ! This is where they hit us . Hang on to something ! Hang on to something ! Sarah ! ( GLASS CREAKING AND CRACKING ) SARAH : Oh , God , please ! Don 't move ! I 'm coming down for you . Here I come . Stay still . Here I come , Sarah . The satellite phone , get it ! NICK : Okay . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( GLASS CRACKING ) Give me your hand , honey . NICK : Heads up ! ( SARAH SCREAMING ) ( SURF CRASHING AND POUNDING ) Your lucky pack . I got her . ( HORN HONKING ) ( CALLING THE OTHERS ) EDDIE : Nick ? NICK : We 're in here . Hold on ! I 'm coming . God damn it ! I 'm coming . What did this ? Kelly . What 'd you do with Kelly ? She 's okay . She 's in the High Hide . Who 's hurt ? What do you need ? IAN : We need rope . Rope . Anything else ? Three cheeseburgers with everything . NICK : No onions on mine . SARAH : And an apple turnover . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) EDDIE : Hold on . I 'm coming ! IAN : Bring the rope . Let 's go . I 'm coming . IAN : Now , now . NICK : Eddie , you all right ? EDDIE : Yeah . I 'm coming . We need the rope . Throw it down here . Hurry up ! Good throw . Did you tie this to anything ? NICK : We 're sliding down ! IAN : Up you go . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC INTENSIFIES ) Eddie ! Hey ! ( SARAH GASPING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Go . Increase your rate of climb . ( SARAH SCREAMING ) ( EARTH-SHAKING REX FOOTSTEPS ) ( MOTOR REVVING ) ( EDDIE SCREAMING ) ( TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ROLAND : Our communication equipment 's been destroyed . And if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers ... They were . Then we 're stuck here . And stuck together , thanks to you people . We came to watch . You came to strip-mine the place . Back off . At least we came prepared . Five years of work and electrified fence couldn 't prepare the other island . You think your Marlboro men will help ? You 're looters . You came to take . You have no rights . An extinct animal brought back to life has no rights . It exists because we made it . We patented it . We own it . You looking for a problem ? And I found you , didn 't I ? Stop ! Come on ! I know you . You 're that Earth First bastard . What 's Earth First ? Professional saboteurs . Environmentalists ! Criminals . Knock it off ! Listen to me . Moving the baby to our camp may have changed the adults perceived territory . LUDLOW : Their what ? That 's why they attacked the trailers . They 're defending this entire area now . We have to move now . To where ? Our boat and their airlift are waiting for orders we can 't send . All right . There 's a communications center here near the old operations building . Everything ran on geothermal power . It was never meant to need replenishing . If we can get here , we can send a radio call to the airlift . You know the frequency ? Here in this book . We 'll mind those . How far is the village ? A day 's walk , maybe more . LUDLOW : That 's not the problem . ROLAND : What is ? What is the problem ? Velociraptors . Their nesting sites are in the island 's interior , which is why we were keeping to the outer rim . Wait . What 's a Veloc ... Velociraptor . Carnivore . Pack hunter . Two meters tall , long snout , binocular vision , strong dexterous forearms , killing claws on both feet . The Rexes may track us , too , if they feel we 're a threat to them or their infant . No , we 'll lose them once we leave their territory . Don 't bet on it . Tyrannosaur has the largest proportional olfactory cavity of any creature in fossil record , except one . Right . The turkey vulture could scent up to 10 miles . Right . This is all very thrilling , but I say we should head for the village . We could head back down to the lagoon . And sit out in the open , next to a heavily used water source hope that your captain comes back ? He won 't . He knows better . Then we head for the village , we might find shelter and we can call for help . Rex just fed , so he won 't stalk us for food . Just fed ? You mean Eddie ? Show some respect . He saved our lives by giving his . Then his troubles are over . My point is predators don 't hunt when they 're not hungry . NICK : No , only humans do . You 're breaking our heart . Saddle up ! Let 's get this moveable feast underway . ( ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) NICK : Excuse me , cowboy . You want some gum ? You seem like you have common sense . Why the hell are you here ? Somewhere on this island is the greatest predator that ever lived . The second greatest predator must take him down . You going to use that ? If he doesn 't surrender , yes . Let me see it . No . The animal exists for the first time in tens of millions of years and the only way you can express yourself is to kill it . Remember that chap about 20 years ago ? I forget his name . Climbed Everest without any oxygen . Came down nearly dead . They asked him , " Why did you go up there to die ? " He said , " I didn 't . I went up there to live . " I didn 't wish you luck on your new venture . You 're off to a promising start . My team is intact . I 'm sorry for the loss of your man . It 's easy to criticize someone who generates an idea , assumes the risk . When you try to sound like Hammond , it comes off as a hustle . It 's not your fault . They say talent skips a generation . I 'm sure your kids will be sharp as tacks . Hammond 's reach exceeded his grasp . Mine does not . Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long , sad history of bad ideas . And I 'll be there when you learn that . ( ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC CONTINUES ) ( ROARING ) Go . ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) Take a break . Five minutes . Are you injured ? No , it 's the baby 's . I set its broken leg . It won 't dry in the humidity . LUDLOW : Roland , a word ? I 'd love to know where we are . Making friends with Ahab ? ( MEN CHATTERING ) DIETER : Carter , I 'm going to the ladies ' room . Wait for me here . Okay ?

Ten minutes , you 'll reach the ridge . Wait for us there . No one tells the little girl . Right . Let 's carry on . Everybody up . Come on . Up , up . All right , guys , let 's get the hell out of here . Come on . ( SUSPENSEFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) ( WHISPERING ) Roland ? AJAY : Did you find him ? ROLAND : Just the parts they didn 't like . Map . The operations building is right down in there about a mile and a half from the base of these cliffs . How do you know that ? I 've seen it . The climb down won 't be easy . We 'll let them sleep one more hour . Then we hit it . ( DISTANT EARTH-SHAKING REX FOOTSTEP ) ( DISTANT EARTH-SHAKING REX FOOTSTEP ) ( EARTH-SHAKING REX FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Oh , no .

I want to be airborne before the female knows we 're here . LUDLOW : Roland ? You probably saved ingen . We lost everything we came after on this trip . But this animal and its infant will bail us out . Congratulations . You 've got your trophy ! A buck only . But it 's alive ! Everyone will line up and appreciate it and what you did for us .

I 've spent enough time in the company of death . ( SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) Oh , my God . ( ADVENTUROUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) LUDLOW : Fifteen years ago , John Hammond had a dream . Like John himself , the dream was grand . It was outsized . It was bold . It was impractical . It was not to be . But half an hour from now , John Hammond 's dream , re-imagined , will come true . For .01 of the cost of building a destination resort thousands of miles away ... IAN : Is this the Ludlow affair ? It 's private property . We 're on the list . Turn around , get back in your car . This is Dr. Harding , I 'm Dr. Malcolm . We have Mr. Ludlow 's test results . There 's good and bad news . LUDLOW : Tonight we will christen Jurassic Park , San Diego , with a mega-attraction that will drive turnstile numbers to rival any theme park in the world .

( REX GROWLING ) Now you 're John Hammond . ( OMINOUS INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ) SARAH : Why wasn 't it tranquilized ? MAN : It was , with two darts of Carfentanil . It was over 10 milligrams . SARAH : That 'd put it in a coma . It stopped breathing . We gave it naltrexone to counteract . But we didn 't know how much . You gave an antagonist without knowing the dosage ? You put it in a narcoleptic state . It 's a locomotive now . We 're prepared here . Any more dinosaurs on the boat ? No , we brought the infant back on the plane . We had this to tranquilize it . Do you have the infant ? ( FAINTLY ) It 's safe . Ian . The animal 's dehydrated . First , it 'll go to a water source then look for the next thing its body needs . All the containment equipment is here . We got to get it to the dock . The boat might be seaworthy . I know what you 're gonna say . When we brought the baby to the trailer , it came . There 's no reason why it won 't do the same thing here . Yep . Where 's the infant ? In a secured facility . Why ? Where 's the facility ? ( EARTH-SHAKING REX FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) There 's a dinosaur in our backyard . Benjamin , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? What ? Come on . There 's a dinosaur in our backyard .

By our calculations , they should be nearing the halfway point of this trip . Jim , can you still hear me there ? JIM : Yes , I can , Bernard . We are halfway to the island . It is 206 nautical miles from our present location . The ship is moving at 20 knots which will put it in at about 11 : 30 a.m. , Eastern time . One of the Navy 's primary concerns has been safety . If we look at the ever-growing escort around the ship they 're taking no chances of a repeat of the San Diego incident . TV REPORTER : Let 's take a moment to run the tape of our interview earlier today with John Hammond . He 's the former head of InGen Bio-Engineering , the man who is now spearheading this movement not only to return the animals to their island but to keep the island itself intact . It is absolutely imperative that we work with the Costa Rican Department of Biological Preserves to establish a set of rules for the preservation and isolation of that island . These creatures require our absence to survive , not our help . And if we could only step aside and trust in nature life will find a way .

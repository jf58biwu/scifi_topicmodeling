 Maybe you can fill these " holes " , correct some of my mistakes , and repost this file , so everybody has a better version of these subtitles . I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! It 's allright . I 'm not gonna hurt you . What do you want ? I don 't know . Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Stop ! What ? What ? - It 's okay . Come here . What was in there ? - Just gimme a minute cause I have to figure things out . - why have you feared that room ? - Gimme a minute I said . How many people are in this thing ? - Listen . We can 't go climbing around in here . - Why not ? - There are traps - What do you mean traps ? Booby traps . I was in the room down there and something almost cut my head off . Holy cats . Holy , holy cats . You alright ? Mister ? Worth ! Don 't worry . I hit my head . Let me take a look at that . I 'm a doctor . It doesn 't look bad . What the hell are you doing ? Hey , old man , did you hear what I said ? Motion detectors . Integrated into the walls . Tough to spot . Oh god , oh god , oh god . Wait a second . Let 's all just relax for a minute . Does anybody remember how they got here ? Perogies . I was eating dinner . Perogies . Cheese and potatoes . I ran out of sauer cream and then I went to the fridge and then ... I don 't know . You ? Leaven ? I , I just went to bed and ... What about you ? I just woke up here . Middle of the night . It 's like Chilie . He was always coming in the middle of the night . Who ? Only the goverment can build something like this big . It ain 't government . Then what is it ? - I don 't know . Aliens . Please , let 's keep the head down and put things simple . Let 's rule out aliens for now and concentrate on what we know . My mom 's gonna freak . - Rennes ? I just won 't be there . She 'll freak . - What do you think , Rennes ? My suggestion is to go still . I 'll move in a straight line . - All right , I tend to agree . Shouldn 't we wait here ? - For what ? - To see if anybody comes No one is gonna come . - Look . There is a way in here , so there 's gonna be a way out . We can avoid the traps using the boot . How is it ? What do you think ? Find an exit ? - Ok . What about you ? It can 't be that simple . - It won 't be that simple . - Look around . Take a good long look . I got a feeling it 's looking at us . I just wanna wake up . Leaven . We can do this . We just have to stay calm and work together . It 's gonna be a lot of people looking for us in the outside . I 'm a cop . All right ? - You 're a cop ? - Yeah . I 'm gonna get you out of here . I promise . You 're gonna be with me in this one . - Ok . Boot it ! Clean . It sounded closer . It 's mechanical . It seems to come at regular intervals . Maybe it 's the ventilation system . No vents . - No kidding , I 'm boiling . What is it ? Serial numbers ? Room numbers . They 're different in each room . Oh great . There are only 566 millions 400 thousand rooms in this thing . Would that better not be ? We have about 3 days without food and water before we are too weak to move . Well , they have to feed us , don 't they ? Holloway . Oh , we have heat , stress , physical exsection , dehydratation , headaches , and this desorentation confuses mental processes . The body eventually begins to break down at its own tissue Suck on it . Keeps the saliva flowing . What ? - The air seems dry in there . - Trap ? Well , it can be a chemical sensor . Why the hell didn 't the boot set it off ? The boot 's not alive . Detects hydrogen sulphide of the skin . How is it that you know so much about sensors , Renz ? Renn . Not Renz . It 's French . Fine , you 're French . I 'm asking how you ... Renn . Sensors expert . Moderm age . I don 't believe it . This guy is the Wren . - The what ? - He 's the Wren . The bird of Attica who flew 6 major prisons . Seven . You 're kidding , right ? - You will get us out . - Maybe . An escape artist . Yeah Harry fucking Houdini . The only reason I try this for us is that I can need your boots . If they don 't spark enough I 'm going like that . No more talking . No more guessing . You don 't have to think about nothing that 's not in front of you . That is the real chance . You 're gonna save yourselves from yourselves . Merde . Get him out ! Oh my god ! It was electro chemical . And he missed it . The Wren . That 's great ! Alright . It 's time to reassess this place . - I 've been over it again and again . Why would they throw innocent people in here ? Are we being puhished ? - I haven 't done anything to deserve this . Forget about all that ! You can 't see the big picture from in here , so don 't try . Keep your head down . Keep it simple . Just look at what 's in front of you . - That 's what he said . Start with us . We got an escape artist and a cop . There 's gonna be a reason for that . You 're doctor , Holloway . It gives you a function , a reason , right ? No . It 's just makes me go why me and why not one of the other 10 million doctors out there . Leaven , what are you ? Nothing . I just go to school . I hang out with my friends . What else ? - There 's nothing else . My parents are these people . I live with them . I 'm boring . - I think we have to ask the big questions . What does it want ? What is it thinking ? - One down , four to go . Why don 't you tell us what your purpose was , Worth ? Often wondered that myself . I 'm just a guy . I work in an office building , doing office building stuff . I wasn 't exactly bursting with what a viva before I got here . Life just sucks in general . I can 't stand that attitude . - Because he 's right . What 's your purpose , Quentin ? Kids , three of them . I haven 't made my peace yet . I 'll get out of here no matter what . That 's where my strength comes from . You , people , find yours where do you got it . For Christ sake , Worth . What do you live for ? You kave a wife or a girlfriend , or something ? No . I 'm gonna be fine watching at pornography . Nice , nice I 'm not giving up ! I 'm pissed off . They came into our homes ! They stripped us . They took my rings , they took oh , my amethyst . I wanna know who 's responsible . Leaven . Your glasses ? You don 't need them ? They 're for reading . Well they took off our jewelry but why they put this on you . Here nothing is random . Why are they here ? Leaven . What do you do in school ? - What can they mean ? 149 . Prime numbers . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . See what ? It seems that if any of these numbers are prime then the room 's traps . 645 , 645 ... That 's not prime . 372 ... no . 649 ... Well , 11 times 59 . It 's not prime neither . So that room is safe . Wait . Can you make that assumption based on one prime number trial ? I 'm not . The incinerator thing was prime 083 . The chemical thing had 137 . The acid room had 149 . You remember all that in your head ? I have a facility for it . Leaven , you beautiful brain . Boot it . Okay , out of the way . Brains before beauty . Safe , safe . Prime numbers ! Oh , how long have we been in here ? Nine or ten hours . How do you know ? Five o 'clock shadow . Last thing I remember was shaving . I guess I missed breakfast or lunch . or whatever . Don 't worry . I 'll be on time for dinner . If we get out , I 'll make you dinner . You got a date . Doin ' good . I need to smoke . I 'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk . - Holloway . Just real yourself in a bit . Come on . You 're moving along . Things are looking up - Ok , ok . You are right . I couldn 't smoke in here , so ? I just need to be occupied . Talk then . Have a conversation . What kind of doctor are you anyway ? You know , the free kind . Come on . Help me . Tell me about your biograph . We have three boys . 9 , 7 and 5 . - Good God . Poor woman . There 's no way I would survive that . She didn 't either . She 's not dead , we 're just separated . I 'm sorry . I can do shit the bridge . These numbers aren 't prime . Okay , clear . Excuse me , sorry . - You were , could try to help me here with your body . No , I couldn 't . This one 's trapped too . We have to backtrack ? Not yet . Read them to me . What are you ? A * * * ? It 's stuck . Look out . This room is green . Holloway ? Hi there . This room is green . Yes , it is . I wanna go back to the blue room . What is it ? Shock or what ? I think he 's mentally handicapped . I like the blue room . Jesus Christ . - He almost broke my neck . Hi there . You wanna hold my hand , honey ? Butter first , then honey , Kazan . How 'd he survive ? - I wanna go back to the blue room . There 's lots of blue rooms . We 'll find you another real soon . This is just too bizarre . You just worry about your numbers , Leaven . Go on . I 'll look after him . He almost felt on my head . - We go for a walk , Kazan ? You wanna go for a walk ? Let 's not make him do the climbing thing now . Holloway ... Hol-lo-way . Could they have taken it in the way to New Mexico ? What are you talking about , Holloway ? - I 'm talking about where they would hide something this big . At least he 's good for something . I 'm sorry if I shake your foundations , Quentin , but you have no idea where your tax toll 's gone . Free clinic doctors ? Only the military industrial complex could afford to build something this size . What is the military industrial complex ? Have you ever been there ? I 'm telling you , there 's no such complex . - How would you know from where you are ? What do you think the establishment is ? Just guys like me . Their desks are bigger but their jobs are ... They don 't conspire , they buy boats . This place is .. remember Scaramanga ? The bad guy in " The man with the golden gun " . It 's a rich psycho 's entertainment . Is that what you think ? Clear . Ok . You are a cop . Single bullet theory . Great . Gas ! - Holloway , get back here ! It 's ok . I just swallowed my button . I hate this . I hate this . Your boy is having a connection signal . It 's like cramming without coffee . She needs a break . - She can do it . They don 't look like prime to me . Is that your two bits worth , Worth ? For what it 's worth . Well ? - Well , he 's right . Not prime . Stop ! In front of you ! What is it ? Shut up ! I don 't know what happened . It wasn 't prime . Quentin , hold still . - Somebody stops that rockets . - Worth ! Leave the boots . Shut the fucking door ! I have a feeling about that fucking guy . He knew about that trap . - These numbers aren 't prime . Then your numbers have to fail , but he knew .. - Knew what ? How would he know ? - You are the parer . I won 't think about it . He 's only functioned so far as when the kickers were going down . So he has a bad attitude . This makes a spy of him ? Trust me on this . It 's my job to read people like an X-Ray . He doesn 't like red rooms . So what happened ? You saw what happened . - I guess the numbers are more complicated that I thought . Maybe they mean nothing at all . - No . It means they are more involved . I just need more time with them . Well , we need to rest anyway . Well . That is not a fuckable idea we can do . Are they telling you anything ? They 're no tarots . Do you have any idea how many variables I have to consider before I can decide for numbers this size . They don 't reveal themselves right away . They 're like people . Oh , gross . Not here honey . Go in the corner . Well , he 's just peeing . Jesus Christ . Now it totally reeks in here ! you find all this pretty funny , don 't you ? What 's your fucking problem , Worth ? Even Holloway is better than you . Get over there and help there with them . That 's your job . Babysitter . Ja wohl , Kommandant . Somebody has to take responsability around here . And that somebody has to be you . Not all of us have the logic of playing nihilist . Not all of us are considered enough to play hero . This is a will to live . Everybody 's got any worth , even you . Specially you , hiding behind that cynical front . A will to live . The warm feeling deep inside . Thanks . I 'm a new man . Poor Worth . Nobody loves me . If that 's the chip on your shoulder why don 't you look at it this way . What if you just do lie down and die . Do it . Show us if you have some back bone and jump in the sushi machine . Be a man . Thought so . - Fuck you Quentin ! I don 't wanna die . I 'm just being realistic . Anything that would trouble to build this thing if we just need to walk out . It there would be realistic clues but so far there was no way out . You think we matter ? We don 't . * * * You 're not getting out of here ! Yes , we are ! - No , you 're not ! Yes , we are ! - There is no way out of here ! Gotchya . How do you know that ? Answer the question , Worth . Oh , god . Who are you ? I 'm the poison . I designed the hollow shell . - What ? The shell . The sarcophagus . You built this thing ? Not this part . The exterior . I don 't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here . I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell . A cube . A cube ? Why didn 't you tell us ? God saint . Worth , you knew what it was . Worth . You 're lying . Was not at first . Who 's behind it ? I don 't know . Who hired you ? I didn 't ask . I never left my office . I talked in the phone with some people . Other guys like me . Specialist working on small details . Nobody knew what it was . Nobody cared . Bullshit . You knew from square one . Look at him . He is up to decide who was in this thing . No . Quentin . That 's the way things work . You keep everyone separated so the left hand doesn 't know what the right hand is doing . The brain never comes out in the open . Whose brain ? It 's all the same machine , right ! The Pentagone , multinational corporations , the police . You do one little job , you build the * * * inside the * * * and the next thing you know is too much under the guess of the essential component of the death machine . I was right . All along my whole life . I knew it . I told you , Quentin . Nobody is going to call me paranoid again . We gotta get out of here and blow the leader of this thing ! Holloway , you don 't get it . Then help me , please , I need to know . It 's maybe hard for you to understand . There 's no conspirancy . Nobody is in charge . It 's a headless plunder operating under the ilusion of a master plan . Can you grasp that ? Big brother is not watching you . - What kind of fuckin ' explanation is that ? It 's the best you are gonna get . I looked and the only conclusion I can get is that there is nobody up there . Somebody has to say yes to this thing What thing ? Only we know what it is . We have no idea what it is . - We know more than anybody else . I mean , somebody might to know before they got ... they got fired , or booted out , or sold it , but if this place had never had a purpose when we got miscommunicated or lost in a shufle . I mean , this is and accident , a forgotten perpetual public work project Do you think anybody wants to ask questions . All they want is a clear concience and a * * * I worked for months on this one . This was a great job ! Why put people in it ? Because it 's here . You have to use it or you admit it 's pointless . But it is pointless . Quentin . That 's my point . What have we come to ? It 's so much worse than I thought . Not really . Just more pathetic . You make me sick , Worth . I make me sick too . We 're both part of the system . I do a box , you do a * * * It 's like you said , Quentin . Let 's keep your head down , keep it simple , just look at what it 's in front of you . I mean , nobody wants to see the big picture . It 's too complicated . I mean , let 's face it , the reason we 're here is that it 's out of control . This is how we ruin the world ? - Well , have you even have a clue on your lives ? I don 't feel guilty for ruining the world since I was like 7 . God , if you need someone to blame , throw a rock . - Now , I feel better . - That 's why you stayed with us . To confess . * * * - Quentin ! Stop it ! Stop it ! - We need him . - What for ? * * * He 's the only one who knows anything about the place . - Worth . - Hi . So there 's this outer shell . - Yeah . - And it 's a cube , right ? Like this . - I think so . Are there any doors ? - There 's one door . Where ? - Wherever the door guy put it . And it 's sealed from the outside . What are dimensions of the outer shell ? 504 feet square . May I ? Come on , honey , slide over . 14 by 14 by 14 . The inner cube can 't be flush with the shell wall , there 's a space . One cube ? I don 't know , it makes sense . Ok . The biggest that the cube can be is ... 26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so 17.576 rooms . Seventeen thousand , five hundred and seventy-six rooms ? That makes me queasy . Descartes ! Leaven , you are a genius . What ? What ? Cartesian coordinates . Of course , coded cartesian co-ordinates . They 're used in Geometry to * * * points in a 3-dimensional * * * In English , slower . I 'm sure , these numbers are markers , and quick reference , like latitude and longitude on a map . The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube . Well , where are we ? It works . Ok . All I have to do is add the numbers together . The X coordinates is 19 ... Y is 26 rooms ... So that places us seven rooms from the edge . All right , let 's go . Just out of curiosity . I mean , don 't hit me again , or anything ... but what are you gonna do when you get there ? Maybe we can get the door open . What we need is to figure out how to get around the traps . I 'm dealing with that Holloway . I 'm looking for practical solutions here . Well , you haven 't found any yet . We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot . Worth will go on first . No , he won 't ! We take turns ! Relax . Room for two in there ? What 's the matter ? These coordinates . 14 , 27 , 14 . What about ' em ? - They don 't make sense . Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across , there can 't be a coordinate greater than 26 . If this would be right , then we would be outside of the cube . No , not outside of the cube . I guess that means we 're not having dinner . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap ! Trap ! - Sound activated . Lovely . How come the sound of the door opening didn 't set it off ? Must be rigged to ignore it . So that 's it . The edge is surrounded by traps . Well , I guess we have to backtrack , and try somewhere else . No , if * * * about to take . - I say we cross the bitch . - Right ! How many boots do we have left , Holloway ? Get it off him . We know how it works . We just have to be quiet . That 's pretty fucking quiet . I 'm glad you 're on side , Worth , 'cause ... you 're up . and he is not coming - Of course , he is . - No way . - You are not leaving him behind . He 's unpredictable . When we get to the edge , we can come back for him . But he 'll get somebody killed here . Am I right ? - Shame on you . Will you look at yourselves ? What have you turned into ? They may take our lives but we are still human beings . That 's all we got left . We 'll come back for him . That 's a lie and you know it . He 'll be quiet . - No . - You go out , I 'm here . This way . You fucking fuck ! That 's enough . He is a trap . Let him go right now ! Oh , * * * Holloway . He is a danger in the pack Let him go , you Nazi ! - What did you call me ? Quentin , you let that innocent boy go . You listen to me , woman . Everyday I mob about your bleeding heart . The only reason that you even exist is because I kick you I know your type . No kids , no man to fuck you . So you go around outraged , Sticking your nose at other people 's assholes . Sniffing their business ! You missed your boat , Holloway . You 're all dried up inside there , don 't you ? That 's your fucking problem . How dare you say that to her ? You don 't know her , Quentin . None of us know each other here . Oh , I do . - No you don 't . No wonder your wife left you . All that bottled up anger . And a thing for young girls . God help you , Quentin . Did you smack your kids around too ? Is anybody besides me interested in what 's on the other side of that door ? Open it . Door number six ? Net number one ? Door number two ? Open the fuckin ' thing . Oh , sunshine . Night time . My old friend , the shell . It 's there . Morning ! Hang on to me . I can 't see shit . Nothin ' to hang on to . We gotta try something . We gotta see if the door 's over there . Someone has to swing over there , and take a look . Swing ? We make a rope ... out of clothes . Take ' em off . I 'll tie it around myself . Ah , yeah , and you 're gonna go . You wew like 500 pounds and it will * * * in 2 seconds . I 'm the lightest . - Forget it . - I 'll go . I 'm going , Holloway . She 's right Quentin , you 're too heavy . I 'm the lightest after Leaven . Anyway , it 's my turn . - How long did you know people were being put in here ? - A couple of months . - That 's not long . You can seed your whole life - I am . You opened my eyes Worht . That 's something . David . Helen . You 're such a Helen . That 's as far as you go . There 's nothing down here . Hold tight . I try swinging over there . I see something . I 'm gonna try again . Okay , one more time . Hurry , you 're getting heavy . What the hell 's going on ? Get up here now ! - Quentin ! - Have you got her ? Quentin , is she ok ? She ... slipped . Shhh ... come on . Kazan . - Will you please stop doing that ? You got to be strong , sweetheart . Don 't even talk to me . We gotta get down to the bottom . It will be easier to get under the shell from there . It 's a long fucking way with only one boot . But we 've to do it before we get too weak . You gotta keep cracking the numbers , Leaven . - I can 't think anymore . - You can . It 's your gift . - It 's not a gift . It 's just a brain . * * * - All right . One hour . - How the fuck you how long is an hour ? - An hour is as long as I say . - What are you doing ? We have to make it down to the bottom . It 'll be quiet there , and you can concentrate . You want to leave them ? - They 're traps , Leaven . We are the key . * * * Believe in me ! Try and see what I see . How my mind works . Flash ! I look at somebody and I see like a fucking X-ray . I looked through the walls . I dreamed being him , at his desk , designing everything . * * * There is a purpose . We are the purpose . The cube is us . - Quentin . - We fit . Like numbers . A man and a woman . Two halves of the equation . I take you down , the perfect key . I slip you into the lock . Leaven , it 's time to go down . Get away from her . Leaven , they 're fuckin ' spies . Him , the retard . Holloway , * * * information about my family ... * * * - You dropped her . Just go , Quentin . Give us the boot , you pig ! You don 't want the boot . You want to came with us , Worth ? Down the hatch . What the fuck 's with him ? How did ... It 's , it 's , it 's the Wren . It 's the old Wrenster . How could ... We 've been going in circles . That can 't be . - Where are we ? - I don 't know ! Where are we ? You figure it out ! You haven 't done anything . All you do is freak out you . Murderer ! - I guess you were right , Worth . There is no way out of here . - Get away from me . - Wasn 't Rennes killed in that room ? How come there 's nothing out there ? - It 's the edge . It was not the edge before . It was the room that killed Rennes . - Fuck off ! Oh , that was good . What difference does it make ? We 're dead anyways . Hey , listen to what I 'm saying . There was a room there before . We haven 't been moving in circles . The rooms had . - Of course . - The rooms ? That explains the thunder and the shaking . We 've been shifting the whole time . It 's the only logical explanation . I 'm such an idiot ! - What are you on , Leaven ? - Give me a minute . The numbers are markers , points on a map , right ? - Right . - How do you map a point that keeps moving . - Permutations . - Permu what ? Permutations . A list of all the coordinates that the room passes through . Like a map , it tells you where the rooms * * * , how many times it moves , and where it moves to . - The numbers tell you all that ? - I don 't know , * * * were looking at one point on the map , which it is probably the starting position , All I saw was what the cube looked like before it started to move . - Okay , so it 's moving . How do we get out ? - 27 . I know where the exit is . - Where ? - Stay away from me . - Back up Quentin . - I just wanna know . Don 't you wanna know ? You remember that room that we pass through before . The one with a coordinate larger than 26 . - What about it ? - That coordinate placed the room outside the cube . - A bridge . Right . But only in its original position . - What are you talking about ? Look . The room starts off as a bridge , and then it moves its way through the maze which is where we were into it . But in some point it must return to its original position . - So a bridge is only a bridge . - For a short period of time . This thing is like a giant combination lock . When the rooms are in the starting position , the lock is open . But when they move out of the line then the lock closes . With the * * * of this size it must take days for the rest of * * * a circle . - So , when does it open ? - Don 't . * * * the original coordinates * * * permutations * * * That 's it ! This room moves to zero , 1 and - 1 on the X-axis . 2 , 5 and - 7 on Y. And 1 , and - 1 and zero on Z. - And what does that mean ? You suck at math ? I need the room numbers around as a reference point . 666 , 897 , 466 . 567 , 898 . And 545 . Did you get that ? 656 , 778 , 462 . That 's enough . X is 17 . Y is 25 and Z is 14 . This room makes 2 more moves before returning to its original position . Do we have time ? - Maybe . Then let 's go ! Can you work the traps with this system ? - Fuck the traps . Let 's get to the bridge . - You threw out our last boot , you fucking idiot . - Technically I can identigy the traps . - Technically ? - First I thought that they were identified by prime numbers , but they are not . They are identified by numbers that are the power of a prime . - Ok , so ? - Can you calculate that ? The numbers are huge . But you can , right ? You can . I 'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set . Maybe if I had a computer . - You don 't need a computer . - Yes I do . Figure it out . - I can 't . I 'm not dying in a fucking rat maze ! Fuck . Nobody in the whole world could do it mentally . Look at the numbers . 567 898 545 . There 's no way I can factor that ! I can 't eve start on 5 , 67 ! It 's astronomical ! - 2 . Astronomical . - What did you say ? - Astronomical . - Before that . - Factors . How many factors Kazan ? Of 5,6,7 . - 2 . - What , are you fucking kidding ? - Kazan . How many factors does 30 have ? - 3 . How about 7 ? - 1 . Gum drop . - I don 't have any gum drops . - Gum drop . Kazan . I 'll give you a whole box of gum drops reaching the edge . Gum drops come in bags . Ok . You want them in bags , they are coming in bags . I don 't like the red ones . - 898 . - 2 . - 545 . - 2 . - He 's giving us the factors . - Astronomical . - You are telling me * * * boy , he is a genius ? - By those numbers the room should be safe . Only one way to find out . Don 't ! Safe . Kazan , my man . What 's the number , buddy boy ? Right here , look here ! Make him do it ! Kazan , we 're gonna do some numbers there , ok ? We like to do numbers , right ? - Prime numbers . - That 's right . Can you tell me the factor of 656 ? - 2 . 779 ? - 2 . 462 ? - 3 . Clear . Move ! Come on . Come on , let 's go . You too , Worth ! Move your scary ass , Worth . I 'm not through you yet . Leaven , open that door . Get Einstein working on the numbers . - Go ! - Worth ! 563 ! Please , Kazan , 563 ? - You fuckers , you 're dead ! 2 . - Clear ! 1 . - Trapped ! Check the floor . - Is he dead ? - Not quite . * * * * * * a fucking trap on the wall . - Where is he ? - Come here . I said come here right now ! Gotchya . That way . 2 . - Clear ! 4 . - Clear ! It just that proved our theory . Numbers . 4 , 2 , 3 . - Clear . Kazan ! - Listen . - He hasn 't moved far . - I 'll go find him . - What do you think ? - You don 't have a lot of lives left . - Kazan ! - I didn 't move . - Yeah . Could you * * * , ok ? - I don 't like that . 14 , 26 , 14 . Worth , get back here right now ! - Five bags of gum drops . - 27 bags total . - 27 bags . Deal . This room 's next move takes us to the bridge ! We 're coming ! Over here ! Move in . We don 't have much time . Come on . - Worth ? Worth ? - This better be it . - It should be . - Where ? - Oh , no ! - Give me a minute . Be patient . - So , I guess what ? - I don 't know . This is the room we started in . I was right . We should never have moved in the first place . The bridge . Red . 4 , 2 , 4 . - Clear ! - Go ahead . - What are you doing ? You can 't quit now . It 's not your fault ! - I have nothing to live for out there . - What is out there ? - Boundless human stupidity . - I can live with that . Kazan ! Get out through the door ! Red , Kazan .

 Our analysis suggested that there were 117 psychological archetypes . We selected a human subject to fit each archetype . This is 117 . Initial warrior probability rating 8 % . Of all the subjects , why did this one last the longest ? What does he have that the others don 't ? Subject will be purged this evening . His brain will be dissected in the hopes of answering these questions . 19 . On the first day of invasion . 19 ... million ... will die . Three days ago i had no idea , that life as i knew it ... was about to end . Corporate espionage is jumped 134 % in the last 5 years . In Nagasaki , Japan , Interpol investigators ... discovered an entire school , devoted to training it 's students to steel business secrets . Your business secrets . The Viceroy Uplink is the nerve center . that links all the security apparatus in the building . I just spend 80.000 dollars on new locks , Mr. Foster . 80.000 dollars ? Goodwin ! Pretty good locks . But ... the problem with Goodwin locks is they don 't provide comprehensive security against the advanced industrial espionage we see today . Goodwin locks are fine for your average run of the mill home security . But you wanna place your company 's survival in the hands of an ordinary lock ? What do you know ... Goodwin safe locks . You guys went all out , didn 't you ? Again ... Half way decent lock . But the problem with the Goodwin safe lock , as any thief can tell you , is that they have occasional seem ruptures which make them a cinch to beat if you know what you 're doing . Ridiculous . That lock has TXTL 60 rating . No offence sir , but the Titanic was rated the best ocean liner on its maiden voyage . If i could demonstrate ? Go ahead . I love modern art . Marketing plans for next year 's downsizing ? Let 's see the Uplink . Gentlemen , the Uplink is a multi-ban transceiver , that links each security apparatus in your office , to a central station . The Uplink will meet all of your security needs . Viceroy guarantees it . It 's crazy . I ' ve had these hallucinations before . Once in the park ... Once when i was driving ... but never in a sales meeting . Hallucinations ? You sure you weren 't having an acid flashback ? So let me get this straight : You opened up your briefcase , and pulled out a severed head dripping blood ? With a brown moustache and a scar beneath the eye . Whose head ? I don 't know , never met the poor bastard before . What ' d you do ? I told them i had lunch in the company cafeteria and the beef stew was acting up . Well , they bought the excuse and they bought the Uplink . Here 's to Cade , i always knew he was insane . Excuse me . I 'll be right back . I 'm sorry Mr. Foster , your credit card isn 't working . Well it should be , can you try again ? . The credit service requested we destroy the card . I 'll deal with it later . You 're a dope . Telling stories , got carried away . I don 't think your hallucinations are material for a stand up routine . I 'm sorry Han . I talked to Mary . Her uncle 's chief of staff at North Western . What could he tell me that five other specialists couldn 't ? There 's no medical reason for these visions . He recommended someone at the Mayo clinic in Rochester . Hannah , i got a job , remenber ? Take time off . Doesn 't happen all that often . You put the best face on every situation . And i love that about you . But i 'm scared . Don 't be . Come on , let 's take a walk . What about them ? They 'll survive . So , happy anniversary ! You 're unbelievable ! Enough with the complements , open it ! Cade ... It 's beautiful . Don 't you remember that picture ? Your old instamatic . How cold was it that day . We kept each other warm . I owe you everything , Hannah . You stood by when no one else would . I know it 's rough right now , but we made it before , right ? And we 'll make it again . I love you , Cade . What 's wrong ? Nothing . It 's nothing . You can imagine my surprise when i received these by registered mail . You 've had quite a colourful past . I 'd be the first one to admit i was juvenile delinquent . That 's an understatement . Suspect Cade Foster , not yet of legal age , is considered the best break and entry man in Cook county . Suspected of 37 highline thefts and 3 bank hold ups . He 's also an expert forger and a master of disguise . He uses no weapons but should be considered dangerous ... Thanks to my wife i changed my whole life around . You lied on your Viceroy application . You never would have hired me otherwise . I 've been one of your best employees because of my previous experience . Some security firms rely on the gimmick of having ex-thieves on their staff . Not this one . We are a fortune 500 company , if this leeks out ... you could cost us more jobs than you could ever hope to bring in . Who sent those records ? That 's none of your concern . Those records were sealed by the county , someone 's out to sabotage my career . You weren 't honest about your backround . Cade , you 've been one of our best employees , but you let me down . I 'm sorry , i have to let you go . Who sent those records ? That 's confidential . You owe me that ! I 'm sorry , Cade . I 'm not leaving till i find out . Do i have to call security ? What the ... ? Hannah ? Hannah ? Hannah ? Hannah ? Hannah ? Hannah , it 's me . It 's okay . Come here . It 's me , it 's Cade . It 's okay ! I heard noises , i hide in here . I didn 't know who was here . Who was in our house ? It 's okay . I don 't know babe . But i 'm gonna get some answers . It 's okay . Hello sisters ! Just like riding a bike . You used to keep your tools in that bag . What was it this time ? A bank hold up or a jewerly heist ? Look , Hannah ... We agreed a long time ago that those tools were going in the garbage . I had to find out who got me canned . I am terrified and you sneak out and leave me alone ? I got a security guard watching from across the street in his car and i got Charlie next door with a shotgun . Are you back in the game ? - Is that why people came to this house ? - No ! The person who sent my records to Viceroy was a cop , his name is Samuel Hitchens . Cops were never your biggest fans . It 's more than that Hannah ... Our credit cards don 't work , i went to bank machine , it says we have a zero balance in our account . Someone 's out to tear our lives apart . But who ? Who would do that to us ? I don 't know . But Sam Hitchens is tied to this and first thing tomorrow i 'm gonna find out what he knows . I 'm gonna find out . Oh , thank God you 're here . I 'm looking for Samuel Hitchens . I called 911 . Why ? What 's the matter ? He 's locked himelf in the room . He won 't come out He 's got a gun . Please ... Please help me ! Please ! Okay , okay . He 's been acting crazy for weeks . How so ? He sees things . Visions . It 's driving him out of his mind . Sam ! Please come out . Get away ! Leave me alone ! He thinks someone 's out to get him . Sam , come out . Get away ! Who 's out to get him ? They stole our money , maxed out our credit cards . Got him fired from the force ... Who ? Sam ? There 's someone here that wants to talk to you . You let someone in ? He 's a nice man , Sam . Please . Please , speak to him . Sam ! No Sam ! Sam ! We got him on restraints , detective Hitchens . But i 'd be careful anyway . Two weeks ago he bit a nurse 's finger off . Right at the knuckle . I 'll keep my hands to myself . Be right out , detective . Courts ruled you were incompented to stand trial . Yes . I 'm insane . Funny thing about being insane is that i sure don 't feel crazy . You 're no detective . The man in my hallucinations was . Who are you ? I read the newspaper accounts of your arrest . The things you said happened to you ... are happening to me . Hallucinations ? When did they start ? Six months ago . A man 's face , couldn 't get it out of my head . I watched that same man commit suicide not more than an hour ago . They seem to have connected us ... to one another . I don 't know how . They watch us , you know . They know every detail of our lives . I suggest you check your house ... for surveillance cameras . Who are they Mr. Mayhew ? I wasn 't sure , at first . I thought it might be a rival corporation . Then , 37 million dollars disappeared from my business account . I sent a team of 75 men to track these bastards and grind them into the ground . What did they find ? Clues ... As to identity of those who would destroy us . I 've hidden the clues . Buried at the center of the maze behind my house . Under the ruby red eye . Red . Who are they ? They ' re the aliens ! Aliens ? You didn 't say anything about aliens at your trial . What purpose would that have served ? Why did you kill your family , mr . Mayhew ? They were imposters . Who sent you here ? No one . They sent you to kill me , didn 't they ? I 'm here to help , mr . Mayhew . You 're one of them ! You 're one of them . You 're one of them . He 's one of them . Stop it ! He 's an alien ! Why can 't you let the police handle this ? The cops were crawling all over this place after what happened the other night . They got any hot leads ? No . No . If you want something done you have to do it yourself . What the hell are you doing ? Mayhew said there were surveillance cameras . Cade ? I want you to see the specialist in Rochester . I 'll go with you . We 're broke , remember ? My parents said they 'd lend us the money . You told your mother about this ? What was i supposed to do ? " - How is Cade ? - He 's fine mom . " He 's out back checking the light sockets for tiny surveillance cameras . " Sweetheart , you 're really scaring me . Hannah ... What 's happening with me has got nothing to do with specialists or head shrinks . This is some kind of conspiracy . A conspiracy ? Aimed at you and some crazy millionaire murderer ? Mayhew was out of his gourd . But we both had the visions . You 're talking about a man who slaughtered his family in cold blood . He said he had clues to their identity , buried in the maze behind his house . Cade ! Hannah , i know i 'm grasping at straws , i don 't know what else to do . Go to Rochester ! If you don 't , i am not sure how much more of this i can take . Hannah , the shower always drips . What ? Ever since we bought this place there wasn 't a single plumber who could fix it . Cade , what are you talking about ? Drip , drip , drip ... You could set your watch by it . Cade , stop ! So why isn 't the shower dripping ? Cade , please , stop this ! Stop this ... Oh my God ! Mayhew was right . We 're on Candid Camera . He said the clues were buried in the center of the maze . Under the ruby red eye . So , where 's the center then ? I think it 's this way . What now ? We start digging . There 's something here . Cade ! The ruby red eye . NOSTRADAMUS 1564 Nostradamus ? Mayhew marked this page . Cade , wake up ! Mayhew is crazy . If you wanna read Nostradamus pick up a copy of the National Enquirer . Quatrain 18 , Verse 6 : This place scares me . On the seventh dawn of the seventh day , a twice-blessed man will roam the fields . Doomed to shadows with his brethren or savior to all who walk the ground . Let 's get out of here . He marked this passage for a reason . I wanna ask him what it means . No ! - Please , Hannah . - No . Last chance . We 've got to get back to Mayhew . You 're the detective who visited mr . Mayhew the other day . Yesterday , he didn 't seem suicidal . He had an acute schizo-paranoid disorder . Suicide is extremely common . He leave a note , any indication as to why ? Obviously we don 't leave writing implements within the patient 's reach . Do you mind if i have a look ? Be my guest . Stay here . Okay ... detective . # 19 HAVEN ST . Hannah , the number 19 has been in my head , it 's been on the walls of our house , And now this . There 's some significance , i got to check it out Enough ! I 've been humoring your detective work all day . Go to Haven St. and i won 't be there when you get home . Okay . Okay , we 'll call the cops . I don 't want to go back to the house . No way . Then we 'll ... We 'll get a motel room , we 'll figure out what to do next Okay ? Okay , come on . File a report . Get it , i wanna file a report . Okay , okay . I 'll be in to see a desk sergeant tomorrow . Why didn 't you try to explain ? Explain what ? That a suicidal maniac left me an adress ? So what are we going to do ? I 'm putting you on a plane to Seattle , Go see your parents . I 'll call the FBI try and launch an official investigation . I 'm not leaving without you . Hannah , you 're going . No , i 'm not ! I 'm scared . I 'm more scared than i 've ever been in my whole life . I 've lost everything else , i ain 't gonna lose you . For your own safety i 'm putting you on a plane first thing in the morning . If you insist . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Are you allright ? You 're looking at me so strangely . Yeah , yeah , no , it 's nothing . Everything 's going to be allright . I promise . Cade , i need you . Hannah ? Hannah ? Hannah ? No ! Sir , move away ! Stay away from me ! Move away , nice and slow ! Let 's go . Put on your clothes ! You 're coming with us ! She 's dead . What happened here ? MENTALLY INCAPACITADED SELF ELIMINATED IN PROCESS Don 't make a move ! Put the flashlight down ! Do it ! Do it know ! Hands behind your back . It 's a test ! The proof 's inside 19 . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law . Look at the pictures . Look at the God damn pictures . No ! No ! No ! You have the right to an attorney . If you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed to you . Oh God , you 're one of them ! You 're an alien ! Alien ! The jury has found that Kincaid Lawrence Foster guilty of the murder of Hannah Foster . It is the opinion of this court that mr . Foster be commited to the Wilsonville Psychiatric Institute . Open ! Shallow ! Our analysis suggested that there were 117 psychological archetypes . We selected a human subject to fit each archetype . This is 117 . Initial warrior probability rating 8 % . With most of the subjects mental breakage was achieved by programming hallucinations with our psychotropic drugs , thereby destroying the emotional center of their world . Family . Friends . Business . With 117 however , even our most radical procedure , purging his wife , only seemed to strengthen his resolve . Our use of the subject 's wife was quite clever . We grew a genetic duplicate with generous helpings of our own DNA . Of all the subjects , 117 was the only one to reach our proverbial finish line at 19 Haven . His reward : the brief knowledge that he was a minion in our experiment . The experiment as you know was a test of human will in the face of cruel adversity . 117 has taught us that human will can occasionally surprise . Of all the subjects , why did this one last the longest ? What does he have that the others don 't ? Subject will be purged this evening . His brain will be dissected in the hopes of answering these questions . Good work doctor . No gentleman , give credit to 117 . His final warrior probability rating was 97 % . Really ? If there were more like him these humans might stand a chance . I 'll report your findings to the council . What did they call him ? They called him Cade Foster . 19 . 19 . On the first day of invasion . 19 million ... will die . Now ... Let me show you subject 56 . The tobacco lobbyist . He became mentally unhinged in only two weeks . This is very interesting . Don 't you think ? Good work . Thank you . GOODWIN LOCKS Warning ! Security alert ! I know you are here . I know you are here . I know you are here . I know you are here .

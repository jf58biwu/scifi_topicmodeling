 You make man ? No- - woman . MONSTER : Woman ? [ THEME MUSIC ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and makin ' weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces and bits and pieces . Bits of my creation- - is it real ? It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation , my creation . It 's my creation from my heart and from my hand . Why don 't people understand ? It 's alive- - alive ! What do you mean , they don 't sell " Baby Huey " here ? " Baby Huey " bites . No way . He 's hysterical . I mean , he 's got that big diaper . It 's for two-year-olds , Lis ' . Gary , could you hurry it up , please ? The movie starts in 10 minutes . Hold on . Two more racks , that 's all . We 'll save you a seat . Whoa . Scary guy . " Creep Killer , " ew . Fittingly , he stands vigil over the premier issue of his own series . Why is it under glass ? Oh , sh- - it 's only the alternate chromium di-cut cover version of the polybag special edition that included mini action poster , trading card . And it had low distribution in some areas . It 's worth more than my spleen and my kidney . " Tori , " great name . Short for Victoria ? Lavatory . I was born in one . My mom couldn 't make it to the hospital in time . You 're yanking ' me . M- - so what if I am ? You don 't like the program , change the channel . I got a new favorite show . So who do I talk to about a job ? Oh , Mr. Jolly . He 's the boss . Job ? Mm , to look at you , I 'd say you 've got comic books in the blood ? I remember my first job- - selling curry door to door . The curry man 's here , the children all used to cry as they wheedled tuppence from Mum for a spicy treat . [ CHUCKLES ] Welcome to the family . So what 's up after school today ? I was thinking maybe we zap over to India and do a little cow tipping . You guys go on without me . I don 't want to be late for my first day at work . I want Tori to see how punctual I can be . Check out mister no time for cow tipping . Jealous ? Maybe I am . Gary 's got a plan , a career . He knows where he 's going . Get a grip . He took an after-school job so he could score with Tank Girl . [ MAN CLEARING HIS THROAT ] It 's Principal Scampi . Get lost . Don 't worry . I 've got a disguise . See ? Look at me . I 'm a teacher . A daily affirmation we would all do well to remember , Miss , um- - Primavera Con Queso . Latin , correct ? Si . Well , Miss Primavera Con Queso , I 'll be counting on you to pick up the slack around here this week after I go under the knife for my corrective surgery . Oh , going in for a little tummy tuck ? [ LAUGHS ] A joke . That revered Latin wit . A tummy tuck , indeed . Very good , Miss Primavera Con Queso . Mr. Donnelly . Now , where were we ? Ah , OK , you 're right about why Gary took the job . But it 's still a start . Me , I 've got no idea what I 'm doing after high school . That 's why they invented college- - so you can wank around for another four years . Yeah , but what about after that ? Grad school . Wank , wank , wank . And then ? You think too much . Meet me after school , and I 'll come up with something . [ CHIMES SOUND ] I 've solved your problem . " Career Sampler . " Looks like a box of chocolates . They 're magic chocolates . Each flavor has the power to send you into a different job . You can sample careers until you find the one that 's right for you . Well , how do I know what kind is what ? That 's the fun part- - you don 't . Forget it . Last time I wish I had a fun part , I ended up giving birth to a baby kangaroo . [ THUD ] - Ah ! [ POP ] [ ELECTRICITY ] [ EKG MACHINE BEEPING ] FEMALE WORKER : All right , steady . [ CHIMES SOUND ] That stuff really works , doc . I 'm high as a Chinese kite and twice as festive . Normally , I 'd be pretty squirrelly about having my skull opened and my gray matter fondled . [ GASPS ] ( QUIETLY ) I can 't do it , Lis ' . I can 't perform brain surgery on my principal . Oh , relax . The brain 's a very resilient organ . Don 't touch that . You 'll cripple him . They tell me you 're the best brain surgeon a principal 's salary can afford . That 's good , because that BB has been lodged up there for far too long . I want out of here . I 'd like another chocolate , nurse . After the operation , doctor . I 'll talk you through it . Make a 1 / 2-inch incision along the anterior lobe- - the gray , gushy thing with the stuff around it . Perfect . Really ? Hey , this isn 't so bad . What 's that thing ? Motor functions . Poke it . Oh , how did that get there ? Try here . [ LAUGHS ] I know , doc , I don 't want to play backseat surgeon here . [ SQUISH ] You know , doc , I don 't want to play backseat surgeon here . [ SQUISH ] You know , doc , I don 't want to play backseat surgeon here . Oh , get over yourself . It 's just a little fun . [ CAR LOCK BEEPS ] [ CHUCKLES ] An alarm ? Alarms , hidden video cameras . Around here , the security is tighter than Dan Ackroyd 's pants . It helps the would-be thief resist the siren call of temptation . And it keeps my insurance affordable . Sure you don 't miss any , Wallace . Buzz off , Ratso . Rico . ( ANGRY ) My name 's Rico . Hey , Tori . You know , I 'm- - I 'm working on a customized level for Doom . Mm ? Yeah , I 've , uh , reconfigured all the cyber demons to look like the rogues ' gallery of Batman 's greatest foes . Yeah . You sh- - you want to see ? I 'd rather see my own intestines draped from a chandelier . [ LAUGHS ] Yeah , right . Right , OK . So you know , let me know when you want me to- - to show you , and I 'll- - [ MUMBLING ] People . What 's up , blondie ? Not much . A little organizing , a little pricing . You know , the fun stuff . Oh , I like fun stuff . Want some help ? With the books ? For now . We can work on that pesky virginity problem later . Ooh . What a rush . I- - I was scared at first , until I realized that you were a walking encyclopedia of surgical knowledge . Is that what you thought ? No , no , you just did brain surgery on " ER " last night . So you want another chocolate ? I don 't know , Lis ' . Career hopping is fun , but a little risky . I mean , we 're lucky nothing went wrong with Scampi 's operation . Come on . It 'll be fuuun . Oh , what the hell ? [ ELECTRICITY ] SHOW PRESENTER : And now , the headliner you 've all been waiting for- - ladies and gentlemen , Jerry Seinfeld . [ APPLAUSE ] [ WOOS ] Wh- - [ MIC FEEDBACK ] What is the deal with that , um , ai- - airline food ? It tastes pretty bad , huh ? Tastes bad . Uh , that- - that reminds me of the time that I took my cat on an airplane with me . He peed . [ COUGHS ] Oh , boy . [ ELECTRICITY ] POLICEMAN ( ON WALKIE TALKIE ) : You have 15 seconds to detonation . Disconnect the secondary ignition cap trip wire from the primary solanoid fuse . Oh , boy . [ ELECTRICITY ] [ CIRCUS MUSIC ] Ha ! [ SCREAMING ] [ THUD ] Oh , boy . [ ELECTRICITY ] [ THWACK ] Huh ? I 'm sorry I had to do that , partner . I 've been trying to reach out and touch you , but you 're not listening . You gotta pull it together . You 've got Internal Affairs breathing down your neck . Your ex-wife is suing you for the damn alimony . And I 'm screening calls from your AA sponsor . So if I gotta knock a little more sense into you , buddy , well , then that 's what I gotta do . Oh , boy . Hey , guys . Oh , you hear that ? Every syllable drips with guilt . Huh ? If you have something to tell me , you 'd best say it now before it 's too late . Geez , I 'm 90 seconds late . Dock me already . Blondie , give back the comic book . Huh ? You think I took it ? Ah , the local constabulary . Officers , here is your thief . I wish him punished to the fullest extent of the law . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ GRUNTS ] OK , punk , you got one chance to answer this . Did you take the comic book ? No . That 's what I was hoping you 'd say . Now , you gotta be real careful on these floors , kid . We wax the hell out of them . And they 're slippery . People have a habit of falling . [ CLEARING THROAT ] Partner . Uh , why don 't I handle this one ? What ? That little whimpus folded like a tent . We 're gonna serve him up to the DA with an apple in his mouth . Well , the , uh , thing is I sort of wanted to knock him around a little . Sorry , kid . You had your chance . Now , my partner has to take over . Ooh . Remember , kid- - watch out for the floor . [ CHUCKLES ] [ GULPS ] [ ELECTRICITY ] Man , I thought he 'd never leave . Lisa , this cop 's gonna beat me up . Turn him into a Dixie cup . Gary , shut up . It 's me , Wyatt . Huh ? Wyatt 's in that cop 's body . What the hell did you wish for ? Long story . So can you get me out of here ? That may be tough . Why ? What proof could they possibly have ? This . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] That tape 's wrong . I didn 't steal anything . For what it 's worth , I believe you . But that doesn 't change the fact that they got you on tape . It looks bad . So what ? I got a genie in my camp . Lis ' , zap me out of this mess . You got it . [ ELECTRICITY ] What ? What do you know , there 's a moral restraint clause in my programming that prevents me from aiding and abetting accused felons . I wonder who dropped that little Easter egg into your source code . Hey , it seemed like a good idea at the time . Relax . I 'm a cop , remember ? Cool . You can destroy the evidence and get me off . Well , that 's not what I was thinking . Oh , right . You 're gonna plant the evidence and frame somebody else . That 's good , too . Actually , I was counting on due process ensuring that justice prevails . You are such a weenie . What ? Look , Ratso framed me . I don 't know how , but he did . He 's had it in for me for a while . All you have to do is find out how . We just got a lead on that chop shop . Get your last shots in , and let 's move . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] What about me ? Duty calls . Boy , give the guy a badge . You know , uh , Scravinovich , I 've been thinking about this comic book store robbery . I don 't think the kid did it . Mm , hold that thought , pal . Here 's your cut , copper . Whoa , much obliged , Stormy . And hey , hey- - be careful out there tonight , ya hear ? Mm . Innocent , guilty , what 's the diff ? I thought you stopped caring about lowlife scum like that when your second wife left you . Or was it when you started drinking ? Argh , well , I mean , hypothetically- - Yeah ? - -if someone had a videotape of you committing a crime , what would you do ? You 're asking me , what would I do if some hypothetical person had a hypothetical videotape of me committing a hypothetical crime ? Yeah . You 're wearing a wire ! You son of a- - you helped me bury the body ! You hear me , you bastard ! ? You helped me bury the body ! You son of a- - [ RIPS ] Oh . No wire . I 'm sorry about that , partner . Hey , hey , do you want the last cruller ? [ POLICE SIREN ] What are you in for ? They say I stole a comic book . How about you ? - Littering . - Oh . [ CHUCKLES ] - -body parts . Oh , don 't worry . I 've learned my lesson . Next time , I 'm using a garbage bag . You look like a 13-gallon . Get me outta here ! Ah , quit your whining , you friggin ' lowlife . [ RATTLES FENCE ] [ SNICKERING ] Wyatt , when are you gonna get me out ? I 'm working on it . What 's taking so long ? Hey , you 're not the only thing in my life , OK ? My partner 's on the take . I got Internal Affairs on my ass . And I just found out my stepson 's been arrested . Hi Daddy . Hello , Cyrus . We 'll talk later . Just hang tight . And don 't fall asleep . CYRUS ( SINGING ) : Rock-a-by baby in the treetop- - [ MUSIC PLAYING ] You look pretty beat . Any luck ? No . Nothing . We know Gary 's innocent , but they got him on tape . It doesn 't make any sense . You 'll figure it out . You 're a good cop . Good cop ? More like a bad lieutenant . Hey , partner , check this out . I made you a present . [ CHUCKLES ] That 's all your ex-wives rolled into one- - Trixie 's eyes , Sylvia 's hair , Sheila 's big , fat mouth . Can 't forget that . [ CHUCKLES ] What is this thing ? It 's the mug shot computer , you dummy . You can make any face you want on that thing ? Interesting . What 's more interesting is that all your ex-wives are felons . Lis ' , I think I just figured it out . Good news . I 'm about to close this case . Hey , don 't rush on my account . Me and Cyrus are having a great ol ' time . Did I mention he wants to make a business suit out of my skin ? That 's it . I 'm getting you out of here . Right after the party games ? Have a little faith . Ta-da . A substitute Gary . That 's supposed to look like me ? Well , we see balloons . Everybody else sees an exact copy of you . Lisa , you 're brilliant . I know . Let 's motor . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] What 's the plan , big guy ? Step one- - get rid of Ratso . Hey , did you see ? Kate Mulgrew just walked past the front door . Captain Janeway ? Yeah . Oh , boy , do I have some serious continuity questions for her . Hey , it 's America 's Most Wanted . Tori , I swear , I 'm innocent . Oh , I hope so . What kind of geek would steal a comic book when the register was full ? What 's going on ? Oh , Officer Wyatt Towsky here is cracking the case . We just need to get into Ratso 's laptop . We 're screwed . It 's password-protected . Any ideas ? Breasts ? Breasts ? Spend 10 minutes with the guy . [ BEEPS ] - It worked . We 're in . As a dog returns to its own vomit , so returns the criminal to the scene of the crime . This boy is innocent . And I 'm about to prove it . Do you guys remember in " Jurassic Park " how the dinosaurs looked like they were stomping around the jungle ? But- - but they weren 't . They were computer images merged with actual filmed scenes . I see where you 're going . Fiendishly clever . Good thinking . Dammit . Why am I always the one who needs everything explained ? Ratso used his computer to set you up . He merged two video images to create a new fake one . Look . On the right , a 3-D image of Gary . On the left , we have the original footage of Ratso stealing the comic book . Drag and drop the 3-D rendering- - instant frame job . I did it for you , Tori . I 've always loved you . You just thought I was a geek . And then when Wallace came in and you liked him better . And- - I just kinda lost my head . Nice try , Ratso . Nobody 's buying it . How can you be so callous ? Oh , here , Rico . Use my hankie . Rico ? Nobody ever calls me Rico . It 's all right , Rico . I 'm dropping the charges and giving you a raise so you don 't have to steal anymore . I 'm sorry I failed you that . I don 't believe this . I was going to be hauled off to juvi , but he gets a raise ? There 's no justice . Yeah , look on the bright side . You could still be stuck in that interrogation cell with my partner . All right , kid . I have had it with this silent crap . I want some answers now . [ SMACKING ] Still not talking ? You know , kid , the thing about smoking- - it 's a real dangerous habit . [ POPS ] Oh , man . Internal Affairs is gonna crawl up my butt over this one . Gah . You really saved me , Wy . I owe ya . [ SNIFFS ] You been drinking ? It 's the shirt . So , Wyatt , you ready for another chocolate ? Oh , no , thanks . I 've learned there are some things you can 't find in a box of chocolates . Doing a job right requires experience , training , and skill . Oh , right . For that , you need the magic gummy bears . I 'll take a chocolate . They look good . BOTH : Gary , no ! [ ELECTRICITY ] MAN ( ON PHONE ) : Hello ? Hello ? [ GASPS ] What 's going on here ? MAN ( ON PHONE ) : I 'm trying to talk to ya . What are you wearing ? Jeans and a shirt . Why ? MAN ( ON PHONE ) : ' Cause I wanna rip your clothes off . I 'm such a dirty dog . Get lost , pervert . Wait a minute . Chett ? ! [ GASPS ] [ THEME MUSIC ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different , we 're making weird science . Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces and bits and pieces bits , bits- - my creation , is it real ? It 's my creation . I do not know . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ?

 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Testing . Hey , do you think I 'd get more business or less business if , as my Christmas gift , I made up , like , 500 coffee mugs that say " Mr. beefy " ? Less . More . Less . More . Less ! More ! Um ... Less . More . Less ! More . Less ! More ! Gee . Gee , that 's funny , because I sent 3 baskets here to the cartoon network which everybody gobbled up , and I never got thank-you note one for . See ? Less . But what are you gonna do ?

Joining me tonight , chart-toppers David byrne and Donny osmond . My first guest is a most singular fellow . Please welcome David byrne . Thank you very much for having me . Welcome .

All these retro punks with their pale white skin and their black clothing and their friggin ' moist music and ... oh , I 'm only kidding ! I didn 't say you were one . Oop . See , there you go . Now you took offense . So , is this the first talk show you 've ever been on ? Ha ha ha ! In outer space , of course . Yes , it is . I hope it is not the last . What do you mean by " it " ? I ... Can I come back to that ? I ... sure . Thank you . So , what have you been doing ? I find myself ... Living in a shotgun shack . Lately ? Lately , I 've been traveling in a bus . How lately ? Being a ghost , does that mean that , uh ... that ... you have lived in a previous life ? Before this one . Yeah . Right . I like that . I hope the same thing happens to me . What thing ?

Uh-huh . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! For many weeks . Ha ha ! Hee hee hee ! Whoo ! What about croutons , David ? I love them on a light salad . Not a crouton man , but I like to put them in a separate dish . Not a crouton man . Ha ha ! You can have my croutons and bac-os . And how . Maybe eat them later . Mmm ... Yes , I see your point . 1 , 2 ... No , it 's fine now . Hello ? Hello ? Yep . Now we 're ok . However , I find that in a salad , they are used to inflate the size of the salad , much as if it were styrofoam packing material . Wow . I need some packing material . Why do you need some packing material ? To pack . Pack what , zorak ? Some things . What kind of things ? Zorak things . Oh , really ? I myself , I 'm a creature from Scotland . Yes , really . Going somewhere ? Where ? From Scotland . I said , going somewhere ? Oh . Yeah . I 'm putting my insides on the outside . Uh-huh . That 's what it 's about . Mm-hmm . Thank you very much for having me ... So , this place you 're going , you 'll be needing a lot of things ? I will , again and again . Oh , yeah . A lot of things . Like 10 things , or maybe 12 ? I believe it was Moses who brought the 10 condiments . Sure , sure . Maybe everything . Everything , huh ? I would like to go ... You know , just in case . If you don 't mind . You know , I don 't think you 'll be going anywhere . Mr. ghost ? Since you 're not allowed to leave ! Ohhh , I think different . You forgot to pack something . Huh ? What ? This destructo ray . Ha ha ha ! Uh , no , thanks . Oh , I think you need this destructo ray . Uh ... David ? I forget . What do you like on your salad again ? Oh , no ! And I still don 't have an answer . Waiting ... Uh ... Anything that makes my skin tingle . Croutons are what make me tingly . Yeah . I 'm serious . I 'm crou-tingly . I should hope so .

No , no , no , no , no , no . I 'm not doing that . Why not ? Because I 've seen your show before , and I 've seen what you do to your guests when they start plugging . You cut to people yawning , you cut to boring things while they talk about what they 're doing , so I 'm not going to tell you that I 'm going to release my ... Behold the woolly panda . It is plump and round . The nearby sound of a throttling chainsaw frightens him . " Eek , eek , " says the panda . I 'm not going to fall prey to your tricks here . So , Donny , is it true that ... ahem . So , Donny , is it true that ... Excuse me a second . How you doing , zorak ? How do I do what ? Um , hmm . ¶ Zorak , you 're an idiot ¶ I think you 're so dumb . ¶ Donny osmond , Donny osmond ¶ Donny , Donny , Donny feh ! I didn 't know zorak was a singer . Zorak is many things . Amazing . Do you have $ 5.00 ? No . Do you ? I 'll ask the questions here ! Ok . Next question . Listen , I 'm in L.A. soon , so ... I need to sleep on your couch . Ok . For a whole month . No . Why not ? You afraid of me ? Don 't want me in your house ? Mm-hmm . Afraid I might kick your butt ? Jerk ! Get my agent on the phone , quick ! They 're building that birdman set next door . I 'll kick his butt . Yeah , I 'll kick your butt ! Whoa ! Calm down , everybody . I 'll calm down now . All right , sir . Fair enough . Donny osmond . Feh ! Ok . Let 's just do it . One thing that 's bugging me . Who 's your sister ? Marie . Yeah . If Marie 's a little bit country , and you 're a little bit rock and roll ... What 's the rest of you ? I guess if I 'm a little bit rock and roll , the rest of me is composed of mostly water . Liquid water ? It 's the truth . Made from scratch ? Yeah . All right . Being an osmond , you must have many archenemies . Enemies ? Space ghost , I 'm Donny osmond . I don 't have enemies . Ha ha ha ! How about that bonaduce kid ? I heard you two were in a big fight . I punched him in the nose , and I won that fight . But it was fixed . So you didn 't win the fight . I won the fight . Sure , Donny . Set it up again ! We 'll have a rematch . I 'll beat him . Like you did before . 'Cause I won the fight ! Ok , you won the fight . Who cares ? I won the fight . Ok ! Ok . Anything else ? How ... how did you get this show ? Did you ... did you audition for this or something ? I 'm kidding you . I 'll be nice . I 'll be kind . So , besides those teeth , what superpowers do you have ? Um ... Everybody said I ... I can sing well . Do it ! Do you like croutons ? Nuts ? Croutons . No , no ... no . Grapes . They 're better . Better for idiots . Does Marie eat grapes ? Why don 't you get Marie on the show and let her ... yeah ! Why don 't we get Marie on the show ? Moltar , I want Marie ! Call her agent . ¶ How do you solve a problem like Marie-e ? Heh heh heh ! I don 't watch that show . Ok . Just have him call my agent and talk to my attorneys . We 'll set something up . I think we can do this ourselves , Donny . This isn 't our first barbecue . Ok . Hey , Donny , Donny . Donny ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Donny ! What ? Where do we go when we die ? Fire drill !

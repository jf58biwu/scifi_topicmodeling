And you , Handyman ? I got stuff to do . OK . l`ll make the first call now . Yes . Let 's go over a few details . Yes . Komiyama Saori was abducted near " L " and confined somewhere . Always remember that premise . Yes . That where , is of course not here . Meaning you leave no evidence of having been here . Yes . First , don 't go touching anything . Yes . Second , keep the curtains shut , like this . Yes . When you need a light , use this . Yes . And obviously , don 't answer the phone or the door . Of course you stay inside . Keep it locked up . Yes . And no feeding those fish either . What ? Listen . You 've been kidnapped . How can you feed the fish ? But they 'll die , then . Who matters more , you or the fish ? I understand . Next , the Hostage Life , 101 . 101 ? First , no baths . Or showers . No showers ? Of course not . Not even my face ? Listen , lady . If you want the story to fly , you need actions , not just words . I`m sorry . Also , only eat the food I brought . Don 't touch any of her food . I understand . it 'll be rough , but that 's the deal . Yes . And there 's one more thing . While you were being held , your hands and feet were tied . Yes . You have to tie me ? It 'll be more realistic if your hands and feet are bruised . Put on the others . Yes . I 'm ready . I 'll get rid of these clothes . All right ? Yes . I 'll tie you up now . You 've got to bear it . Yes . You see how I did it ? I guess . Undo it to go to the bathroom , but tie yourself back up again . I understand . Your wrists , too . It doesn 't have to be so tight . You want to be able to untie it . Yes . Try it . Pull this through here . And tie it like this . Yes . Pull it with your teeth . What are you doing ? You 're defenseless , aren 't you , lady ? What ? I always wanted to fuck someone tied up . We 're not playing anymore . Get it ? Please ... don 't ... This is Shinko Enterprises . Hello . This is Sato from Meiwa Bank . We always appreciate your business . Is the president in ? Please hold . Now this is what you call reality , lady . I 'll call when I get back . But I can 't answer the phone . I 'll ring 3 times , hang up , then 3 times again . You unlock the door . I 'll call when I 'm close . Three rings , and then another three rings . Lady . A mistake to answer the phone . Who is this ? Who cares . You ? You did this ? It 's your fault , Mr. Kidnapper . Why 'd you do it ? It just happened . That 's no reason . Look who 's talking . You snatched her liberty . No . She asked me to stage a kidnapping . That 's all . You tied her up to stage a kidnapping ? It 's the truth . She asked me to kidnap her . Huh . I wonder if the cops will buy that . I need a favor . What ? Dump her for me . What ? I don 't like loose ends . Do it yourself . Don 't want to get caught . Enough of your crap . Forget it . Oh , well . Then I have no choice . Meaning ? I 'll call the cops right now . Tell them I heard a woman screaming in 303 . What 's wrong ? OK . I 'll do it . Thanks . What ? Take care of it . Noboru . Daddy . What 's wrong ? What happened ? Had a fight ? OK . C 'mon inside . This is Ebara AII-serve . I can 't take your call right now . Please leave your name and number after the tone and I 'll call you back . Hello , it 's Misako ... Hi , it 's me . What , you 're home . Say , is Noboru with you ? Yeah he is . Why can 't you call ! What ? I didn 't know where he 'd gone , and was about to call the police . Sorry . Why are you always like this ? Can 't you think about others ? Noboru came by himself . But you could still call ! Sorry . I 'll come get him . No , I 'll bring him . Leave now . OK . Wait here , Noboru . Where you going ? Where you going` ! Move your car ! Let go ! Wait up ! Asshole ! Kept you waiting . You look tired . No . Why don 't you take a little time off from work ? That 's not really possible . Besides , I 'd rather be working . I see . Please . Any leads ? No promising leads so far . Mr. Komiyama , so much time has passed , I think it 's time to reconsider our approach . What ? So far , our number one priority was your wife 's safety . But with no further contact from the perp , there 's very little we can do . From now on , our priority should be finding him , by widening our investigation to include the public . Just wait . What about Saori , then ? Mr. Komiyama . I don 't want to give you false hope . In my experience , loss of contact with the perp in a hostage situation usually means bad news . They 'd kill her over a measly 5 million ? Perhaps the perp`s real intent was to kill your wife . That 's ridiculous ! What for ! I understand how you feel . I 'm disappointed myself . But rationally re-evaluating the situation , I advise we go public . Do we have your consent ? I understand . Thank you . May I speak with the owner ? Yes . Just a minute please . Dad , a policeman to see you . May I help you ? I 'm sorry to trouble you , but you manage the Seiwa Heights complex , correct ? Yes , that 's right . Manage it exclusively ? That 's right . I see . I need to see the lease for apartment number 303 . Oh , yes . Just wait a moment . Have a seat . Let 's see , number 303 ? Yes . Here it is . Look . Act Promotion Inc . But a young woman occupies the premises . Yes , a young lady . Why is it leased to this Act Promotion ? The company rents it for corporate housing . I see . Yes . What is the nature of Act Promotion`s business ? If I remember correctly , it 's a modeling agency . Model agency ? And who occupies 303 ? Her name ? Just a minute . Tsushima Satomi . What ? Not Soma Rumi ? No . Miss Soma`s in apartment 302 . Let me see . This news just in . Komiyama Saori , the wife of Komiyama Takayuki , CEO of Shinko Enterprises , has apparently been taken against her will . Police surmise that Saori was abducted on the 26th , after leaving the restaurant where she and her husband had dined . Because the restaurant faces a private street , and the victim ... Um , did Miss Tsushima ... No , it 's just that no one 's ever home , and we wondered who lives there . A radical ? And Miss Soma in 302 ... Oh , Act Promotion rents 302 as well . Excuse me . Yes . I 'm from First Plan , I 'm picking up Soma Rumi`s book . Oh , Rumi ? Yes . Rumi`s here . She is ? Rumi ! Yes . Someone from the ad agency . What commercial ? Cosmetics . Wow . Which brand ? That 's still not ... Print or TV ? TV for now . I 'll do my best . Excuse me , but don 't you live in the Seiwa Heights complex ? Yes , but ... Next to Tsushima Satomi ? You a friend of hers ? Well , yes . Her boyfriend maybe ? No , I 'm not . Satomi doing OK ? Sure . I haven 't seen her in a while . She 's pretty , but her figure 's not ... I hear she 's not working much . When word got out she slept with a client , she stopped getting calls . But I 'm not like that . Don 't tell the agency , but I have a boyfriend . We moved in together . So I rarely go back to Seiwa Heights . Oh , I see . Yes . I 'm from Ebara All-Serve . Oh , great . I can 't let go right now . Let yourself in . OK , I will . Help me please . Where 's the main tap ? What ? The main tap . Not really ... OK . Thank you so much . I was at my wit 's end . You 're welcome . I missed you , Satomi . Is it safe meeting like this ? I told the office I 'm resting . We 're OK for a while . Trouble sleeping ? Yeah . How come ? Guilt ? No . What with the cops camped out at the house ... Why don 't you get some sleep ? I 'm fine . Besides , I haven 't seen you in so long . Uh huh . The investigation ? Going nowhere . Don 't worry . They 'll never find out . We 'll be fine . Can I take a shower ? Sure . Satomi , did you dream that up ? What ? The ransom from my sister . What 's that ? You didn 't know ? No . Your handyman swindled my sister out of 5 million . But in fact , it `s made the whole thing convincing . Huh . You sure he 's all right ? Meaning ? He won 't talk ? He 's fine . Are you OK ? You need help . No , I 'm fine . But ... Try some string . String ? Tighter . What do we do ? Hey . I 'll turn myself in . Why ? We don 't have any choice . Neither of us has a driver 's license . A suitcase . She 'd fit in a big one . You 're crazy . Don 't worry . It was self-defense . You can live with that ? Your company ? I can 't let things end like this . Don 't we look alike ? What ? You once told me I resembled your wife . I did ? I don 't think so , but ... Maybe . Answer me ! Once , when you had on some wild make-up for a job , I thought you resembled her . Huh . Listen . What do you say we take a gamble ? Meaning ? If our luck is strong , we 'll get out of this mess . If it 's bad ? Things can 't get any worse . So , what is it you want me do for you ? You 're a handyman , right ? Which means you can take care of anything ? Well , most things . You 'll do the job then ? First , I need to know what it is . Of course . Don 't worry . Just ask me . Your secrets are safe with me . Yes . I want you to kidnap me . What ? Kidnap me and demand a ransom from my husband . Will you do it ? You mean I kidnap you ? Yes . And get the ransom from your husband ? Not that far . Just threaten him ... Is this a game ? No . Here 's 100,000 yen . This should take care of it . I 'd like to know why . Do I have to tell you ? Yes , please . I want to test my husband . An affair ? Yes . Have you confronted him ? I 've investigated . I see ... She 's very beautiful . Younger than me and more attentive . The type who makes a man feel comfortable . I can 't compete . I love my husband . I can 't bear to lose him . But as things are , I 'm so anxious that I keep finding ways to avoid him . It only drives him away from me and towards her . I can 't help myself . A vicious cycle ? Yes . And this kidnapping will reveal your husband 's true feelings . Yes . I see . Ok , OK , that 's nice . Rie , fix that . OK . Ready . Here goes . OK , last shot of the day . OK , thanks . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . You were great . Thanks . Komiyama Saori . What 's so funny ? Cut the crap ! It 's not a game of tag . Tag ? That 's what it feels like . Enough ! Why me ? You did choose me . So you remembered . Yeah . It was chance . What ? My going to see you . Liar ! it 's true . You dreamed it all up ? That 's right . You kill her ? No . The phone call ? That was me . Not bad , huh ? But I knew all along that you 'd find me . Why ? A hunch . I wanted to see you . You mean the whole set-up was all about playing tag with me ? Maybe . This was my bet . Your bet ? And now you 've won ? We 'll see ... That 's up to you . Change . What ? Become Saori . My turn to gamble . Why the get-up ? What happened ? He found out . Who ? The handyman . How ? I don 't know . Did he hurt you ? Did you talk ? And , what does he want ? He wants 30 million . I see . Pay him this time , and it 's just the beginning . You 're right . What will you do ? I guess this is where our luck runs out . You 're giving up ? What ? It 's not over yet . What else is there to do ? I wish I 'd just turned myself in . Scared ? What ? As long as I 'm with you , I 'm not scared . You 're sure now . Yes . It 's Tsushima Satomi . She resembles ... What ? Komiyama Saori . No one 's here . That him ? Can 't tell . Hello , Mr. Komiyama . The handyman ? Yes . Did you bring it ? Yeah . You 'll do exactly as I say , now . What ? Give her the bag of cash , and send her to 302 . Just wait a minute . Let 's talk . Where are you ? Let 's treat this as a business transaction , Mr. Komiyama . OK , but first , promise me one thing . That this 'll be the last time . OK . I promise . You take this . And you ? I 'll be fine . Besides , he 'll go after the one with the money . I know you 'll find a way . You can do it . For us . Now what ? The bathroom . The bathroom ? This is the police ... Miss Tsushima . What happened ? Lieutenant . You 're back . What ? Now we 're even . I won my bet . You win yours ? That color becomes you . Both liars , huh . I left everything behind . You don 't have to run from me . Let 's go together !

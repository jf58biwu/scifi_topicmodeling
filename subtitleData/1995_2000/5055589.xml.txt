 - GOOD EVENING , FATHER . - IS SHE READY ? YES . BAPTISM IS THE RITE OF INITIATION . THIS HOLY WATER TAKES AWAY ORIGINAL SIN . THE SACRAMENT CONFERS THE GRACE OF GOD , BRINGING THE SOUL INTO GOD 'S FAMILY . DARA , I BAPTIZE YOU IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER ... AND OF THE SON ... AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT . BLESS YOU , MY CHILD . [ Thunderclap ] [ Clock Chiming ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] DARA ? OH , MY GOD . DARA ! DARA ! DARA ! DARA ! DARA ? OH , MY GOD . DARA ! NO ! BLESS ME , FATHER , FOR I HAVE SINNED . IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION . YOU HAVE A SIN TO CONFESS ? FATHER , I 'M AN F.B.I. AGENT . I 'VE TAKEN IT AS MY CODE AND PURPOSE TO UPHOLD THE LAW . TO SAVE LIVES . AND NOW YOUR WORK HAS COME IN CONFLICT WITH YOUR FAITH . IN A WAY . I WAS HERE FOR EASTER SERVICES LAST WEEK , AND FATHER McCUE APPROACHED ME FOR MY HELP . WHY DID HE COME TO YOU ? BECAUSE THERE WAS A FAMILY THAT HE FELT NEEDED MY HELP . BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT . FATHER , I HAD A DAUGHTER WHO DIED ... A STRANGE AND SUDDEN DEATH SEVERAL MONTHS AGO . FATHER McCUE THOUGHT THAT BY HELPING THESE PEOPLE ... YOU MIGHT IN SOME WAY HELP YOURSELF ... TO COME TO TERMS WITH YOUR GRIEF . - YES . - BUT YOU HAVEN 'T . FATHER , I TOLD YOU THAT I HAD A SIN TO CONFESS . BUT THE SIN OF WHICH I 'M GUILTY , I 'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN OFFER FORGIVENESS . WHAT IS THE SIN ? AN INNOCENT GIRL IS DEAD BECAUSE OF ME . I COULD 'VE SAVED HER LIFE , BUT I LET HER DIE . [ Woman ] THANK YOU SO MUCH . NICE TO SEE YOU . HAPPY EASTER , FATHER . YES , FATHER . HAPPY EASTER TO YOU . GOOD TO SEE YOU . WONDERFUL SERMON . DANA , DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT ? I 'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU IN PRIVATE . I MUST SAY , DANA , IT 'S BEEN NICE SEEING YOU AT MASS AGAIN . I 'VE ALMOST STARTED GETTING USED TO IT . I 'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO COME MORE OFTEN . I DON 'T MEAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR ATTENDANCE , BUT I 'VE BECOME INVOLVED IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION ... WITH A COUPLE THAT ARE ALSO MEMBERS HERE . - DO YOU KNOW THE KERNOFS ? - NO , I 'M AFRAID I DON 'T . RECENTLY , THEY LOST THEIR DAUGHTER , DARA . YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE SITUATION . NO , I DIDN 'T . THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE GIRL 'S DEATH WERE SUDDEN , AND I 'M AFRAID THE POLICE HAVEN 'T BEEN ABLE TO TELL THEM MUCH . ARE YOU ASKING FOR MY HELP ? THE KERNOFS ARE DEVOUT , BUT THEIR FAITH IS GIVING THEM LITTLE COMFORT . I THOUGHT WITH YOUR BACKGROUND , YOUR WORDS MIGHT CARRY A CERTAIN WEIGHT . CAN I TELL THEM YOU 'LL BE VISITING ? [ Mrs. Kernof ] THAT 'S DARA ON HER 16th BIRTHDAY . WE COULDN 'T HAVE CHILDREN OF OUR OWN . I PERSUADED LANCE SIX YEARS AGO TO ADOPT . AT FIRST HE WAS RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT A SPECIAL-NEEDS CHILD , BUT HE BECAME SO ATTACHED TO HER . THEN , THIS HAPPENS . YOU MAKE THE CHOICE NEVER IMAGINING SOMETHING LIKE THIS ... OR HOW VULNERABLE YOU ARE . DARA HAD JUST BEEN BAPTIZED . I KNOW IN MY HEART SHE 'S GONE TO A BETTER PLACE , BUT LANCE IS ANGRY . ANGRY AT GOD . THEY SAY TIME HEALS . UM , FATHER McCUE SAID THAT YOU 'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE ... GETTING MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO HER . THEY SAY NOW SHE MAY HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING , BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW FOR SURE . HOW SHE EVEN GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE ONTO THE STREET IS A MYSTERY . - WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? - DARA SUFFERED FROM CONGENITAL SPINAL DEFORMITIES . SHE 'S BEEN WHEELCHAIR-BOUND HER WHOLE LIFE . - COULD SOMEBODY HAVE TAKEN HER OUT OF HER ROOM ? - LANCE SAW HER WALKING , AND WHEN HE FOUND HER , SHE WAS ON HER KNEES PRAYING . I THINK THAT 'S THE HARDEST PART FOR MY HUSBAND . HE 'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW GOD COULD ... FORSAKE THE LIFE OF AN INNOCENT GIRL ; HOW GOD , IN HIS MERCY COULD LET THIS HAPPEN TO OUR DARA . MRS. KERNOF WAS TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND , BUT SHE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ME . YOU , TOO , WERE ANGRY AT GOD ? I FELT DRAWN TO THESE PEOPLE , FATHER , IN A VERY PERSONAL WAY . I WAS DETERMINED TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR DAUGHTER HAD BEEN TAKEN . AND DID YOU ? AS MUCH AS I HAVE MY FAITH , FATHER , I AM A SCIENTIST ... TRAINED TO WEIGH EVIDENCE . BUT SCIENCE ONLY TEACHES US HOW . NOT WHY . IF YOU WANT ME TO STAND BY MY REPORT , I WILL , BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT 'S NOT EXACTLY OPEN AND SHUT ON THE CAUSE OF DEATH . - YOU THINK IT WAS LIGHTNING ? - I 'M GUESSING IT WAS LIGHTNING . THE WAY HER EYES WERE BURNED ... SUGGESTS THE BOLT MAY HAVE GONE TO GROUND , RIGHT THROUGH THE TOP OF HER HEAD . FUNNY THING IS , THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGN OF ARCING , EXCEPT FOR THE FACE . HER MOTHER SAID THAT SHE WAS FOUND IN A KNEELING POSITION . GENUFLECTING . ARE YOU A RELIGIOUS PERSON ? WHY DO YOU ASK ? I HAVEN 'T BEEN TO CHURCH SINCE I WAS A KID , BUT I WENT LAST SUNDAY . I 'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING . HER BODY WAS RIGORED SUCH THAT I HAD TO DO MY EXAMINATION ... IN THE POSITION SHE WAS FOUND . I 'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT . LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS SURGERY DONE ON HER HANDS . SHE WAS POLYDACTYL . SAME WITH HER FEET . I HAVEN 'T ASKED HER PARENTS YET , HAVEN 'T HAD THE HEART TO , BUT I ASSUME THEY HAD THE EXTRA FINGERS REMOVED . WHAT 'S THE CONNECTION ? I FOUND NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF ANY OTHER TISSUE DAMAGE ... OR ELECTRICAL BURNS OR ANY OTHER SERIOUS TRAUMA . IT 'S AS IF GOD HIMSELF STRUCK HER DOWN . DARA KERNOF WAS ADOPTED . I DON 'T SUPPOSE THAT YOU 'VE REQUESTED ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIRTH MOTHER . - I CAN DO THAT IF YOU LIKE . - NO , THAT 'S OKAY . I , UH- - I HAVE SOMEONE I CAN ASK . SOMEBODY I 'D LIKE TO CONFER WITH , ACTUALLY . KOKLOS . PAULA KOKLOS . ROOM 213 . WE 'LL GET HER THINGS PACKED UP AND GET YOU ON YOUR WAY . [ Man ] HOLD IT ! JUST HOLD IT . ARE YOU FATHER GREGORY ? YES . I 'M AARON STARKEY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES . I AM VERY SORRY , BUT WE 'VE HAD A MIX-UP . - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? - YOUR ADOPTION PETITION FOR PAULA KOKLOS . IT 'S MISSING AN APPROVAL . I 'VE GOT THE COURT ORDER . THAT 'S THE MIX-UP . SEE , IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE TO FAMILY COURT ... WITHOUT GETTING AN APPROVAL FROM THE SOCIAL WORKER ASSIGNED TO THE CASE , AND THAT 'S ME . GIVE IT TO ME HERE THEN AND WE 'LL BE ON OUR WAY . I CAN 'T , AT LEAST NOT YET . I 'VE JUST BEEN ASSIGNED TO PAULA , SO I 'LL NEED TIME TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH HER CASE . LOOK , I 'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS . I 'M HERE TO TAKE THE GIRL HOME . I 'M SORRY , FATHER , BUT YOU 'LL HAVE TO WAIT ... UNTIL I CAN GET THE PAPERWORK IN ORDER . [ Phone Ringing ] HELLO . HEY , SCULLY . I 'M RETURNING YOUR CALL . HI . UH , SOMETHING 'S COME UP . I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD DO ME A FAVOR . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? THIS ISN 'T OFFICIAL F.B.I. BUSINESS , SO I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD KEEP IT OUTSIDE OF WORK . HEY , LOOK , I 'M KIND OF TAILING A POSSIBLE SUSPECT RIGHT NOW , SO I 'M KIND OF RUSHED , SO , UH- - I NEED SOME BIRTH AND ADOPTIVE RECORDS ON A DARA KERNOF . - WHO ? - DARA KERNOF . I CAN 'T TELL YOU MUCH MORE THAN THAT , MULDER . I 'M SORRY . YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A HINT ? ANYTHING ? NOT UNTIL YOU GET ME THOSE RECORDS . ALL RIGHT . I 'LL TALK TO YOU LATER . [ Mulder ] SCULLY ? AREN 'T YOU THE SECRET SQUIRREL . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? GOT A LOOK AT THAT BODY THEY WHEELED OUT OF HERE . YOU 'VE BEEN HOLDING OUT . MULDER , IT 'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK . I DIDN 'T WANT TO INVOLVE YOU . I GOT ASKED TO LOOK INTO THIS AS A FAVOR FOR A FAMILY . DARA KERNOF 'S FAMILY ? YOU FOUND DARA 'S RECORDS ? NO . THOSE ARE HER BIRTH RECORDS . THE ADOPTION RECORDS HAVE BEEN SEALED . I THINK ONE OF MY QUESTIONS HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED . DARA WAS A TWIN . NO . ACTUALLY , SHE WAS A QUADRUPLET , ONE OF FOUR GIRLS . WAS THIS CROSS FOUND LIKE THIS ? YES , AS FAR AS I KNOW . WHY ? IT 'S INVERTED . UPSIDE-DOWN . THAT 'S A PROTEST , A SACRILEGE AGAINST THE CHURCH . PUT THERE BY WHOM ? IT 'S YOUR CASE , REMEMBER , SCULLY ? DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPECTS ? NOT AS OF THIS TIME . COULD THE VICTIM HAVE PLACED IT ? UH , IT 'S DOUBTFUL . PAULA KOKLOS WAS SEVERELY IMPAIRED ... PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY , AS WAS DARA KERNOF . THEY BOTH DIED THE SAME WAY ? IT APPEARS THAT THEIR EYES WERE BURNT OUT . THEIR BODIES FROZEN IN A POSITION OF PRAYER . THEIR PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES COULD ACCOUNT FOR THAT . THEY MIGHT . LOOK , SCULLY , I KNOW YOU DON 'T REALLY WANT MY HELP ON THIS , BUT CAN I OFFER YOU MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION ? YOU GOT A BONA FIDE , SUPER-CRAZY RELIGIOUS WACKO ON YOUR HANDS . WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE ? THE MOTE IN THE EYE , THE EYES AS THE WINDOW TO THE SOUL , EYE FOR AN EYE . HE 'S WORKING FROM ANCIENT SCRIPTURE , ANCIENT TEXT , MAYBE EVEN THE BIBLE . HE MAY EVEN THINK HE 'S DOING GOD 'S WORK . DID YOU FIND ANYTHING ? MY NAME IS AARON STARKEY . I 'M THE SOCIAL WORKER ASSIGNED TO PAULA KOKLOS . THIS IS SO TRAGIC . I JUST HOPE YOU CATCH WHOEVER DID THIS . MR. STARKEY , DO YOU KNOW IF THAT CROSS OVER THERE BELONGED TO PAULA ? I DON 'T REMEMBER SEEING IT BEFORE . I 'M SURE IT DIDN 'T . DID SHE HAVE ANY VISITORS OR ANYBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT BEHIND ? WELL , SHE HAD NO FAMILY . NO FRIENDS , REALLY . I DON 'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THIS , BUT PAULA WAS ABOUT TO BE ADOPTED . BY WHO ? SCULLY , LOOK AT THIS . THE GNOSTIC GOSPELS , BOOK OF ENOCH , BOOK OF " J , " [ Breathing ] APOCRYPHA . I 'M SURPRISED THERE 'S NOTHING HERE FROMJESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR . WHAT KIND OF CHURCH IS THIS ? THERE 'S NO TELLING . - CAN I HELP YOU ? - FATHER GREGORY ? YES . I 'M DANA SCULLY . WE 'RE HERE ABOUT THE DEATH OF PAULA KOKLOS . OH , GOD , NO . ARE YOU ALL RIGHT , FATHER ? I WAS TRYING TO ADOPT PAULA . I 'M SURE YOU KNEW THAT . WE HEAR YOU WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SO . I-I HOPE TO GOD YOU 'RE NOT SUGGESTING I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT . - WHY ADOPT HER ? - YOU THINK I WAS INTERESTED IN HARMING HER ? WHY ADOPT HER ? I-I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HER . I KNEW HER MOTHER . - DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS ? - YES . WE WERE LOOKING FOR HER NAME . IT 'S NOT LISTED ON THE GIRLS' BIRTH RECORDS . - WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT ? - THE OTHER TWO GIRLS MAY BE IN DANGER . WE 'RE HOPING THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US FIND THEM . THEIR MOTHER DIED IN CHILDBIRTH . CAN YOU GIVE US A NAME ? WHEN I WAS A PRIEST IN THE ROMAN CHURCH , BEFORE I FOUNDED MY OWN , I WAS HER CONFESSOR . DIVULGING HER NAME WOULD VIOLATE THE CODE OF MY FAITH . AND YOURS , I SEE . YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO PROTECT PAULA . FROM WHAT ? WHATEVER YOUR INTENTIONS , YOUR SECULAR PREJUDICES BLIND YOU FROM SEEING WHAT 'S REALLY HAPPENING HERE . TWO GIRLS ARE DEAD , NOT BY THE HAND OF MAN . UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THE TRUTH OF GOD 'S TEACHINGS ... THAT THERE IS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL FOR ALL SOULS ... AND THAT WE ARE LOSING THAT STRUGGLE , YOU 'RE BUT FOOLS RUSHING IN . YOU PUT YOUR OWN LIVES IN DANGER , AS WELL AS THE LIVES OF THE MESSENGERS . I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY . I BROUGHT AGENT MULDER ON THE CASE TO HELP TEMPER MY FEELINGS ; TO KEEP THEM FROM CLOUDING MY JUDGMENT . I WOULDN 'T ADMIT IT TO HIM , BUT ... AS WE STOOD THERE , I FELT AS IF FATHER GREGORY WERE SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO ME ... IN A LANGUAGE ONLY I COULD UNDERSTAND . [ Priest ] THE MESSENGERS . YES . I KNOW PEOPLE IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULDN 'T THROW STONES , BLAH , BLAH , BLAH , BUT THAT GUY IS PARANOID . I THINK YOU 'RE A LITTLE EXTREME IN YOUR JUDGMENT , DON 'T YOU , MULDER ? ALL THAT CRAP ABOUT THE FIGHT FOR ALL SOULS , THE LITERATURE WE SAW , THE PERFORMANCE WE JUST WITNESSED , IT ALL FITS . HE THINKS HE 'S DOING GOD 'S LAUNDRY . WELL , HE SAID THIS WASN 'T DONE BY THE HAND OF MAN . YOU THINK HE BELIEVES THAT TOO ? IF HE DOES , HE 'S EVEN MORE DANGEROUS THAN HE APPEARS . EVEN IF HE 'S NOT YOUR KILLER , HE IS HIDING SOMETHING . - WHAT ? - HE SAYS HE KNEW THE MOTHER , BUT HE WON 'T GIVE UP HER NAME . MAYBE SHE 'S STILL ALIVE . I THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO BRING HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING , IF NOT MAKE AN ARREST . BUT , BASICALLY , YOU 'RE RULING OUT ANY ELEMENT OF THE SUPERNATURAL . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? WELL , DARA KERNOF WAS BAPTIZED ON THE DAY OF HER DEATH . SHE WAS SANCTIFIED BY THE RITUAL SACRAMENT , SUBMERGED IN THE SPIRIT . AND WHY WOULD GOD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN ? WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE ? RELIGION HAS MASQUERADED AS THE PARANORMAL SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME ... TO JUSTIFY SOME OF THE MOST HORRIBLE ACTS IN HISTORY . I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS HIS REASONS , HOWEVER MYSTERIOUS . HE MAY HAVE HIS REASONS , BUT SEEMS TO USE PSYCHOTICS TO CARRY OUT HIS JOB ORDERS . YOU WANNA FIND WHO DID THIS ? I SUGGEST YOU AUTOPSY THE BODY BEFORE IT 'S INTERRED ; BEFORE THE MAN WHO KILLED HER HAS A CHANCE TO FIND HER SISTERS . [ Scully ] THE VICTIM IS PAULA KOKLOS , AGE 16 , CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN . I 'LL BEGIN WITH THE EXTERNAL EXAMINATION . VICTIM HAS SIGNS OF CONGENITAL PHYSICAL DEFECTS , INCLUDING FOUR SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS . THE ONLY INDICATIONS OF EXTERNAL TRAUMA ARE THE BURNING , BY MEANS UNKNOWN , OF BOTH GLOBES OF THE EYES . I 'M NOTING SOMETHING ON THE SHOULDER , A BONY PROCESS OF SOME KIND , POSSIBLY A TUMOROUS MASS . NO INDICATION OF SURGICAL PROCEDURE . THE MASS APPEARS ON BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT CLAVICLE . OH , GOD . MOMMY ? MOMMY , PLEASE . I TOLD MYSELF THAT IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD , A HALLUCINATION BROUGHT ON BY MY EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO THE CASE . THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION . BUT THAT 'S NOT WHAT IT WAS , FATHER . I WAS MEANT TO SEE EMILY ... FOR A PURPOSE . WHICH WAS ? TO SAVE THESE GIRLS . [ Mulder ] HEY , SCULLY , IT 'S ME . I DID A LITTLE MORE DIGGING ON THOSE ADOPTION RECORDS . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I THINK I GOT A LEAD ON THAT THIRD SISTER . WHERE ? SHE WAS UNDER COUNTY CARE TEN YEARS AGO . APPARENTLY , SHE WANDERED INTO A TEEN CRISIS CENTER HERE IN D.C. LAST WEEK HOMELESS . THAT GUY OVER AT SOCIAL SERVICES , STARKEY , HE 'S HELPING ME CANVASS THE AREA . IF SHE SHARES ANYTHING WITH HER SISTERS , SHE WOULDN 'T BE WALKING ANYWHERE FAR . WHAT DID YOU FIND ? THERE 'S EVIDENCE OF A DEGENERATIVE BONE DISEASE . AND I KNOW YOU 'RE GONNA THINK THAT I 'M CRAZY , BUT I SWEAR I FOUND EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING WINGLIKE . WELL , THEN MAYBE SHE FLEW HERE , SCULLY . MULDER , THERE 'S SOMETHING ELSE . HOLD THAT THOUGHT AND TELL IT TO ME AND FATHER GREGORY WHEN YOU SEE US . STOP RIGHT THERE ! MOVE INTO THE LIGHT ! MOVE INTO THE LIGHT ! HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE ' EM ! WE 'RE TOO LATE . - WHERE 'S THE GIRL ? - SHE 'S DEAD . - WHERE IS SHE ? - IN THERE . [ Wings Flapping ] [ Mulder ] WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR , FATHER ? MERCY OR FORGIVENESS ? [ Praying Softly ] YOU KNOW , THEY SAY WHEN YOU TALK TO GOD , IT 'S PRAYER , BUT WHEN GOD TALKS TO YOU , IT 'S SCHIZOPHRENIA . WHAT IS YOUR GOD TELLING YOU , FATHER ? I PRAY FOR THE GIRLS ' SOULS . YOU PRAY FOR THEIR SOULS NOW . THAT 'S CONVENIENT . I 'M IMMUNE TO YOUR MOCKERY . YOU 'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH . I AM ONLY INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH . I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY YOU DID WHAT YOU DID ... TO THREE DEFENSELESS , HELPLESS YOUNG GIRLS . WHAT IN YOUR SICK MIND WOULD POSSESS YOU TO BURN THEIR EYES OUT ? DID THEY SEE YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE , LIKE I DO ? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN , FATHER ? TELL HIM WHAT IT IS . ST . PETER . YOU KNOW THE STORY . ST . PETER ON THE CROSS . ST . PETER WOULD ONLY BE CRUCIFIED UPSIDE DOWN ... OUT OF HUMILITY TOWARDS CHRIST . I 'VE RISKED MY LIFE TO PROTECT THEIR PRECIOUS SOULS , WHICH THE DEVIL HAS SOUGHT TO CLAIM FOR HIS OWN . HE TOOK TWO BEFORE I COULD REACH THEM , AND I WAS TOO LATE TO SAVE THE THIRD . [ Door Opens ] AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY ? [ Father Gregory ] YOU KNOW . YOU 'VE ALREADY GUESSED WHAT THEY ARE . THE LAST ONE IS STILL OUT THERE . THE DEVIL IS HERE , AND IF HE FINDS HER , HIS VICTORY WILL BE COMPLETE . SCULLY , THEY THINK THEY FOUND THE FOURTH GIRL . AS LONG AS I 'M IN HERE , THERE 'S NO ONE TO PROTECT HER . LET ME GO ... OR SHE WILL DIE . - YOU BELIEVED HIM . - YES . BUT YOU DIDN 'T TELL YOUR COLLEAGUE . HE BELIEVED THAT HE COULD FIND THE LAST GIRL . BUT I ALREADY KNEW THAT I WAS MEANT TO SAVE HER . FROM WHAT ? I WASN 'T SURE . FATHER GREGORY SAID THAT THE DEVIL CLAIMED THE LIVES OF THE FIRST THREE GIRLS . YOU DON 'T BELIEVE THAT . I KNOW NOW THAT FATHER GREGORY WAS MISTAKEN . THE DEVIL DIDN 'T TAKE THEIR SOULS , BUT THE THREAT TO THOSE GIRLS WAS REAL ... AND FATHER GREGORY GAVE HIS LIFE TO PROTECT THEM . [ Mulder ] THE FOURTH GIRL IS ROBERTA DYER . TRANSFERRED TO MARYLAND ADOPTION SERVICES IN 1995 ... WHEN HER FOSTER FATHER GOT A JOB IN GAITHERSBURG . ADOPTION SERVICES WERE CALLED TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE ... IN SEPTEMBER OF THAT YEAR . THREE MORE TIMES IN ' 96 , THEN TWO MORE TIMES IN ' 97 . - WHAT 'S WRONG ? - FATHER GREGORY CALLED THEM " MESSENGERS . " SCULLY ? SCULLY , DON 'T LET THIS GUY GET IN YOUR HEAD . THAT 'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT . SOMETIMES THE MOST TWISTED ONES ARE THE MOST PERSUASIVE . HE KNOWS WHERE SHE IS . THAT 'S OKAY . AS LONG AS HE 'S LOCKED UP , IT DOESN 'T MATTER . YOU 'RE NOT GONNA FIND HER . I THINK YOU 'RE BEING MISLED . BY WHO ? SCULLY , I THINK YOU 'RE THE ONE WHO 'S BEING MISLED . NOT JUST WILLINGLY , BUT WILLFULLY . I 'VE NEVER SEEN YOU MORE VULNERABLE OR SUSCEPTIBLE OR MORE EASILY MANIPULATED , AND IT SCARES ME BECAUSE I DON 'T KNOW WHY . I SAW EMILY . SHE CAME TO ME IN A VISION . I THINK YOU SHOULD STEP AWAY . PERSONAL ISSUES ARE MAKING YOU LOSE YOUR OBJECTIVITY , CLOUDING YOUR JUDGMENT . YOU GO . GO FIND THE GIRL . I 'M GOING TO FINISH UP WITH FATHER GREGORY . OKAY . [ Man ] FATHER GREGORY . WHERE IS SHE , FATHER ? HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE ? I WILL NOT BE DENIED THIS TIME , FATHER . BUT YOU TOOK THE OTHERS . THE OTHERS WERE TAKEN FROM ME . I WILL NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN . WHERE IS THE FOURTH GIRL ? [ Praying Softly ] [ Groaning ] TELL ME , FATHER . SAVE YOURSELF . I 'D LIKE TO GET BACK IN HERE . IT SHOULD BE OPEN . FATHER GREGORY ? FATHER GREGORY ! YEAH ? WE HAVE A WARRANT TO SEARCH THE PREMISES FOR YOUR DAUGHTER . SHE 'S NOT HERE , I TELL YOU . SHE 'S OUT . SHE 'S AT SCHOOL . WE CHECKED THE SCHOOL . SHE HASN 'T BEEN THERE IN A WEEK . WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE HER LIFE MAY BE IN DANGER . IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING- - - WHAT 'S BEHIND THIS DOOR ? - IT 'S THE BASEMENT . - WELL , CAN YOU UNLOCK IT ? - I DON 'T HAVE THE KEY . IS THIS HER ROOM ? WHERE IS SHE , MR. DYER ? WHERE IS SHE ? THEY 'RE GONNA CUT OFF THE CHECKS , AREN 'T THEY ? - WHERE IS SHE ? - HE SAID HE 'D TAKE HER OFF MY HANDS , BUT I COULD KEEP THE DISABILITY . - WHO ? - THE PRIEST . - WHO ? - FATHER GREGORY . [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ] HELLO ? YEAH , HI , SCULLY . IT 'S ME . HE 'S DEAD , MULDER . WHO ? FATHER GREGORY . THEY FOUND HIM ALONE IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM . NO ONE CAN FIGURE IT OUT . THERE WAS A GUARD SITTING RIGHT OUTSIDE THE ROOM . [ Keys Clatter ] WE DIDN 'T FIND HER . THE FOURTH GIRL , SHE WAS HERE . HEY , SCULLY . SCULLY , ARE YOU THERE ? ANSWER ME . SCULLY ? SCULLY ! SCULLY ? - FATHER . - COME IN , DANA . I UNDERSTAND YOU FOUND THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF THOSE GIRLS . I 'M SURE THE KERNOFS WILL BE RELIEVED . I 'M NOT SURE IF THEY SHOULD BE , FATHER . - WHY NOT ? - I 'VE SEEN THINGS . THINGS THAT HAVE MADE ME QUESTION IF THERE AREN 'T ... LARGER FORCES AT WORK HERE . WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN ? VISIONS ... OF MY DAUGHTER EMILY , FOR ONE . I THINK THAT 'S UNDERSTANDABLE . I 'M SURE YOU IDENTIFIED WITH THE LOSS . I CONSIDERED THAT , UM- - BUT THEN I SAW SOMETHING LAST NIGHT , WHICH I- - WHICH I CAN 'T EXPLAIN . I SAW A MAN IN DARK CLOTHES , BUT HE HAD FOUR FACES . THEY WEREN 'T HUMAN . IS THIS WHAT YOU SAW ? IT 'S A SERAPHIM . AN ANGEL ... WITH FOUR FACES . THOSE OF A MAN , A LION , AN EAGLE AND A BULL . IN THE STORY , THE ANGEL DESCENDS FROM HEAVEN ... AND FATHERS FOUR CHILDREN WITH A MORTAL WOMAN . THEIR OFFSPRING ARE THE NEPHILIM- - THE FALLEN ONES . THEY HAVE THE SOULS OF ANGELS , BUT THEY WEREN 'T MEANT TO BE . THEY 'RE DEFORMED , TORMENTED . SO THE LORD SENDS THE SERAPHIM TO EARTH ... TO BRING BACK THE SOULS OF THE NEPHILIM ... TO KEEP THE DEVIL FROM CLAIMING THEM AS HIS OWN . HOW DID HE BRING BACK THEIR SOULS ? THEY WERE SMOTE WITH THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS COUNTENANCE . TO LOOK UPON THE SERAPHIM IN ALL HIS GLORY ... IS TO GIVE UP ONE 'S SOUL TO HEAVEN . YOU THINK THAT 'S WHAT I SAW ? NO . I THINK WHAT YOU SAW IS A FIGMENT OF YOUR IMAGINATION . A HALF-REMEMBERED STORY FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD THAT SURFACED BECAUSE OF THIS CASE . BUT I SAW IT , FATHER . DANA , THE NEPHILIM IS A STORY . THE TEXT IN WHICH IT APPEARS ISN 'T EVEN RECOGNIZED BY THE CHURCH . FATHER , DO YOU BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS HIS REASONS ? YES , I 'M CERTAIN OF IT . IT 'S HOW HE REWARDS OUR FAITH . [ Starkey ] AGENT SCULLY ? I CAN 'T BELIEVE I FOUND YOU . WHAT IS IT ? AGENT MULDER 'S BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU . HE 'S BEEN DOWN AT THE STATION HOUSE . TRYING TO REACH ME FOR WHAT ? THE FOURTH GIRL . SHE 'S AT FATHER GREGORY 'S CHURCH . COME ON . I 'LL DRIVE YOU . - THERE 'S NO ONE HERE . - THEY MUST BE ON THEIR WAY . YOU DON 'T SEE HER IN THERE ? SHE 'S HERE . I KNOW IT . [ Thump ] AGENT SCULLY ? DID YOU FIND HER ? AGENT SCULLY ! MY NAME IS DANA . I 'M GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF THERE , OKAY ? I 'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU . I 'M GONNA TAKE YOU SOMEPLACE SAFE . WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER ? EVERYTHING 'S GOING TO BE FINE . BRING HER HERE ! BRING ME THE GIRL ! IT 'S OKAY , IT 'S ALL RIGHT . STAY HERE . IT 'S OKAY . STAY HERE . JUST STAY HERE . IT 'S GONNA BE OKAY . BRING HER OUT TO ME . MOMMY , LET ME GO . - MOMMY , PLEASE LET ME GO . - EMILY . AGENT SCULLY , GET HER OUT OF THERE ! [ Emily ] MOMMY , PLEASE . [ Scully ] EMILY ! EMILY ! OH , GOD . OHH . [ Priest ] YOU BELIEVED YOU WERE RELEASING HER SOUL TO HEAVEN . I FELT SURE OF IT . BUT YOU STILL CAN 'T RECONCILE THIS BELIEF WITH THE PHYSICAL FACT OF HER DEATH ? NO . I THOUGHT I COULD , FATHER , BUT I CAN 'T . DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A LIFE AFTER THIS ONE ? YES . ARE YOU SURE ? HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU THAT MAYBE THIS , TOO , IS PART OF WHAT YOU WERE MEANT TO UNDERSTAND ? YOU MEAN ACCEPTING MY LOSS ? CAN YOU ACCEPT IT ? MAYBE THAT 'S WHAT FAITH IS . [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

Brother Matsuba was looking for you What ? Tosa is being released tomorrow . The head of the Nakame family is here . Is he now ? Why did you call me here , shit-for-brains ? What do you want ? The man who cut your arm off is getting out tomorrow . What d 'you think about the rumor ? Rumor ? The boss will give up the seat to Tosa or Yomo . Yomo sounds reasonable to me . But the boss treats Tosa like a real son . Tosa saved the Mutsumi family . That 's dead letter . The Nakame and the Mutsumi are now under the Musashi Union . No in-fighting allowed . Tosa cannot be a successor . Hagane , be careful . Maeda 's been sucking up to Yomo . I knew I wasn 't cut out for the Yakuza . But I didn 't quit ... because I believed in Tosa . I thought his example might help me change . Tosa-san ! Welcome back . Sorry , all the executives are in a meeting . How 's the boss 's heart condition ? Not so good . The doctor says the next attack will be fatal . I see . The boss is waiting to see you . Visiting time 's in the afternoon . so have a rest first . A villa is ready for you . Shall I stop ? No keep going . Yes sir . Hello ? Oh , hello boss ... You go on ahead with him . Sorry about that ... I know ... Yeah ... Yeah ... Yeah ... I remember . You 're that raw recruit . Yes sir !

Hey ... Is my penis big ? Which is bigger , Hagane 's or mine ? Look , I 've got a double length here . Double . It 's really great ! Hagane 's dead . He was always tired . Show me what you 've got . You 've come round ? Don 't worry . You 'll soon be working fine . You 're not ready yet , you shouldn 't have been moved . I imagine you short-circuited . Want to talk ? What is this ? Calm down . Who are you ? My name is Genpaku Hiraga . Self-proclaimed genius scientist . But others call me the Nutty Professor . I 'm not interested in that . Why am I here ? You don 't remember ... the memory unit must be defective . Do you remember ? You were killed along with another guy . I brought you back to life . It 's been my dream to make a robo-man ... so I mess around with corpses . Corpses ? From the black market . They 're easy to get hold of . Murder victims ... or accident casualties . There 's plenty around . You were one of them . Three months ago , I paid 2,000,000 for two . From whom ? I just went to the appointed place . The deal was done on the phone , and the money gets wired . I never see them , that 's the rule . The bodies were terribly mangled . But your brain and his heart were still alive . That 's what I waited for . My technology had reached to the level , to build a robo-man from those bodies . You were really lucky . Don 't talk shit , I 'm patched all over . Don 't worry . The head and the body will be easily joined . I just need more super-alloy , to make you ... Full Metal ! Full Metal ? Yes . You 'll be bulletproof . You have extraordinary power . Your left eye has infrascope and the right has fluoroscope . Both are detachable . They remotely transmit vision to your brain . You can hear sound of up to 2 kilometers . You 've superhuman muscles . Can beat ten people at once . You 're a monster ! I 'd rather die than be a monster . I 'd rather die ! You 'd rather die ? You don 't know how you survived . You saved me didn 't you ? No . So how ? Your friend shielded you . He died for you . Tosa-san ... Let me remind you , his heart is inside you . He is still alive . Just the heart ? Both his arms and legs . Also , his central nervous system was copied . Anything else ? His dick . His dick ? With balls attached , of course . I 've got Tosa 's parts . Yours weren 't damaged but the super robo-man shouldn 't let anybody down in any respect . And one more thing ... Tosa-san ... Please ... complete my tattoo . A piece of cake . You live on metal . Nothing but metal gives you power . Does it taste ? You don 't need taste . You won 't have any emotions ... and , you lose control if you get overcharged . When you get tired , the systems will fail and short-circuit . I won 't have any emotions ? Love , hatred , anger , grief ... they 're just hassle . Hassle ... ? For emergencies , tranquillizers were installed . When you get over-heated and feel wrong ... place your hands here and repeat a mantra . A mantra ? Hush-a-bye baby . ( translated from Russian ) Three times . What is it ? It 's a cradle song my nanny would sing for me . This position provides defense from attack on the right . And this is for attack on the left . Likewise ... Forward defense and backward ... Finished . Perfect . What do you think you 're doing ? What are you doing ? I 'm going . Going ? Why ? We were hit . I can 't get that out of my mind . Don 't be silly , are you going to revenge ? You are made to be a hero . Repeat the mantra . Hush-a-bye baby ... You still cannot control your emotions . Doctor , I 'm a Yakuza . I 've got a mission to perform before I 'm prepared to lose my Gokudo sentiment . No , you are a hero . Don 't be foolhardy ! Keep yourself under control . It 's me . What 's going on ? He 's gone . What ? Get him back . No need . I know where he is . Let 's check his fighting spirit . The Chief ? No need to report . Loser ! Keep your legs straight . Yes . Follow through your stroke The Vice-president hates amateur golfers You 've got to keep your eye on the ball . Sorry . Loser ! If he recommends me as the third , the boss will retire . Our time will come . Yes . Try another ball . Yes , sir . Where are you looking , stupid ? Listen , Tosa is already in hell . Brother ... You 've survived , Hagane . Saved by a doctor . Was Tosa saved too ? Tell me is he alive ? Sure ? I see . Hagane ... You tell that to the boss . He still believes Tosa is alive . Brother , please tell me about that day . Who hit Tosa and me ? I don 't know . Why did you walk out on us ? It 's not true ! Wait ! I just want revenge . Brother ... ! The Nakame family ... Sorry , but my hand was nearly crushed . You asshole ! Call the Nakame family now and tell them the following . Hagane is expelled . It has nothing to do with us . Eliminate him by any means . Brother ! Forget it , brother . Don 't fool yourself . It 's impossible because you are not like Tosa . I 'll get Maeda to forgive you , so come back to the family . Junji , do you love Naomi ? Naomi 's special . Make her happy . What ... ? He may not come . A power cut ? Hey ... Hey ! The guest is here ! You come looking for trouble ? Where 's your boss ? Jerk ! Is he a monster ? He doesn 't flinch . Get rid of him ! Now ! Wait , let 's talk . I 'm here for revenge ... on Tosa 's behalf . No , that was the Mutsumi , your people 's work ... set up by Maeda ! Tosa was a pain in the ass for them . Shit ! Who sold off our bodies ? Maeda told me to get rid of them . Both of them ? Yeah , he said he didn 't care how we did it . You 're lying to me . It 's true . The small one was dumb , so we were lucky to get anything for it . Hey ... Let 's join forces . What do you want ? You bastard ! Do something with him . What can we do ? I don 't know . Just blow him away ! What ? ! You going to let this geek beat you ? Don 't let him get me . Get him ! Go ahead if you want ... but remember ... Tosa 's dragon is on my back ... watching the show . Cool ... Eh ? ! What ? Do something ! Hagane ... I never ... ordered Tosa to be killed . That was Maeda 's decision . How can I believe that ? Your older brother is telling you . Believe me . This is indeed Tosa 's dragon . How come ? Huh ? It 's grafted on . What ? A graft ? Tosa is still alive , within me . Forgive me , Tosa . I should 've picked you up on that day . We didn 't need to lose you . Forgive me . Hagane ... Hagane , you take over from Maeda . Work with me and beat the Musashi-union . Bullshit . You can 't bull me . Stop , you 'll break it . There 's many more ... have got to die ! Let him go ! Taka , I 've got nothing against you . Doesn 't matter . Taka . Don 't stop me . I 've got to do this for Tosa . You 'll have to kill me first . I can 't let you destroy the management . I 'll stop anybody or die trying . You 've taken apart the Nakame family and Maeda 's dead . Isn 't that enough ? You can 't run away . This is the only place for you . Shit ! Why are they all ugly cows ? Pinku ( Erotic ) - Robo should be pretty ! Huge ! " TOMB OF THE TOSA FAMILY " It 's been eight years . He dumped me . He told me I wouldn 't be happy with him . Then he killed a man before my very eyes . He followed the Yakuza code . He was crazy enough to get himself killed soon after his seven years in jail . Why are you here ? I was just drifting and I stumbled across this place . Just drifting ? Now I know why . This place looks where I 'm from . It 's strange ... You don 't look like him at all but you make me feel like I 'm with him . I want to stay here for a while . May I ? Hush a bye , baby ... What are you doing ? I have to say a mantra when my heart pounds . Why ? You 've been away for three months ? Why ? What cold hands ! Is it true that a person with cold hands has a warm heart . Your hands also remind me of his . Please , hold me just once . Make love to me . I want to forget him and to become free . I tried to love somebody else , but couldn 't . You can make me forget him . Yukari ... Don 't you like me ? I do . Then what 's wrong ? I can 't . I love you ... but my body is ... Don 't worry . I know you are worried about your body ... but it doesn 't upset me . I want you . I lost half my body in an accident . I am a monster with a metal body . You 're shocked , aren 't you ? I still love you . No ... ! Goodbye , Kensuke . I wanted to stay with you ... but I can 't forget him while I 'm with you . I cannot love two men at once . Good shot ! You are in good form . Couldn 't get any better ! An excellent hit . Perfect form . How does it feel being at the top ? Not yet . I 've only just started . Pass me another club . This is payback time ! OK ? Look after him . Who are you , bitch ? Well ? Who are you ? You 're Tosa 's woman . Kill me . Leave it to me . Brother ... Brother ... Are you dead ? What ? You 're alive . You know this woman , don 't you ? What ? ! What the hell did you do ? ! What did you do ? ! I 'll tell you ! She failed to hit the chief . Has Yomo become the chief ? She let your name slip and was forced into confessing . Hey , Hagane ... You are impressive . But you ruined the carpet . It cost me a fortune . What do you want ? My life ? I want more than that . Hit the chief of Musashi . You 'll get this bitch in return . She 's missing the tattoo on your back . You animal ! Help me ... Don 't worry , Yomo is scared of you . He cannot kill her . Hagane , it 's me . Don 't worry , you 'll get her back . What about the Musashi Union ? The vice-president Otsuki will succeed ... and Yomo will take the assistant position . That 's the plan . How about you ? Everyone will disappear and I 'll be chief . I see ... the family will be more secured . It 's not too late . Let 's make the Mutsumi bigger . That was our dream . Remember ? No , I can 't . Ken ... You always used to shit in your pants when we went into action . You 're right . What ? I 'd better go . Goodbye . Hey ! Here it is ! It 's a shame . He could 've served us a bit longer . To help beat the Western clan . Don 't worry ... we 'll find the doctor who made him . And make a soldier ? Yes , a loyal robot . It 's ready . We 've groomed her very well . Shit , they would 've blown me up too . Now I 'm with you . Let 's take them . She 's still behaving herself . Enjoy . She 's got a good pussy . Let the young one have the first go . Hey , Matsuba . Go ahead . Stop , Taka ! Open your mouth . Her teeth haven 't been removed yet , but want to try ? It should be nice . Make a nice hole . Bitch ! Otsuki is leaving . You should try it . Thank you . Give it a go . Thank you . Let 's get out of here . Let 's go . Move it ! Don 't bother , run him over . Do it ! Ken . You 've been doing well . Taka , disappear . Taka ... I 'm telling you . Taka , please don 't ... You 're still green . I won 't run away . I 'm a Gokudo . I feel ... pain . I 'm bleeding . I 'm alive .

 - [ Man ] Already checked Corridor 2 . Nothing there . - [ Man # 2 ] Anything at all ? - Where is he ? - Find him ! - [ Buzzer Blaring ] - Come on , go ! Let 's go ! [ Buzzer Sounding , Helicopter Whirring ] [ Ship 's Horn Sounding ] [ Man Vocalizing " Jingle Bells ' " ] [ Man ] Well , I guess Mama won 't be kissing Santa Claus this year . Just tell me what you saw . Hey , I 'm just an elf . I do what I 'm told . You know ? " Be jolly " ? Besides , I haven 't seen the big guy since the party last night . - Oh , yeah ? - When are you gonna shovel him out ? Soon enough . The meat wagon just got here . - Don 't you mean the " meat sleigh " ? - Ho , ho , ho . - Hey . - [ Cop ] Evenin ' . Okay . Got a live one . - A live one ? - It 's a joke . Snowblowers must have buried him . [ Jarod ] Is that ... Santa Claus ? Yeah . The red hat 's a dead giveaway . - Anybody got a shovel ? - No . But I 've got the gift wrap . [ Man Narrating ] Thanks , Gus . Dr. Drake ? Thesejust came in from the mayor 's office . - Same gift as last year ? - Smells like it . Oh , well . 'Tis the season , Fugimora . Pass ' em out . We 'll see who survives this year . Yes , ma 'am . - Uh , so , how 's the new guy doin ' ? - A lot better than Santa . - Drinking on the job ? - Actually , this was from the scene . Dr. Jarod Marley ? Meet Dr. Lisabeth Drake , our chief coroner . - Hello . - Hi . You finished with St. Nick ? - Yes , I am . - [ Man Clearing Throat ] Detective Guerra . Gee , right on time . - Now , can we do this ? - Victim is not Kriss Kringle ... as we first suspected , but a Theodore Hargrove ... 58 , stockbroker , played Santa at one hell of a Christmas party downtown . - Go ahead , Doctor . - He died of a combination of factors , mainly a heart attack . Kim , I thought we were going with exposure . Well , that was my first instinct , but further examination revealed the truth . Heart attack makes sense . Folks at the office party said St. Nick was doin ' ... - one hell of a lambada that night . - I don 't know who " Lambada " is ... but , yes , lividity was affected by the cold . But the blood distribution in the leg muscles would suggest he was doing strenuous acts . - What about time of death ? - [ Dr. Drake ] No way . We can 't pull that off in this weather . Actually , that 's where this came in . The eggnog was hard when we found it , but it wasn 't completely frozen through . Mainly because Mr. Hargrove had quite a bit of brandy in it . - Oh , there 's a shocker . - The milk had time to curdle . So I compared the bacteria levels in the cup ... with that of the sample that fell on the snow ... and I deduced that Mr. Hargrove succumbed to his heart attack ... somewhere between 1 : 45 and 2 : 00 a.m. My guess would be 1 : 48-ish . - [ Whistles ] - I ask for an autopsy , he gives me an eggnog . [ Phone Ringing ] Yep ? Okay . Dr. Drake ? The delegation from the mayor 's office is here . Damn ! They 're early . We 're done here . - Career anxiety ? - Oh , you haven 't met the mayor . But , hey , he gives killer Christmas presents ... And I mean ... killer . [ Groaning ] No , not again ! - Is this for me ? - Geez , Jarod , don 't tell me ... you never got a Christmas present before . Not in a very long time . Thank you . A pastry with candied cherries . It 's fruitcake . A cake with fruit baked right in . Thank you . This has to be delicious . [ Woman On P.A. ] Records Department , please call the third floor . - Should we tell him ? - Let him discover it . Yeah . Mmm ! [ Christmas Carol ] Jarod has been moved to his room . As always , I begin my Christmas hiatus tomorrow . I 'll be in Mount Pleasant at the usual number . It is the Christmas season . But the Tower deems it best to insulateJarod ... from the trappings of popular culture . [ Young Sydney ] Jarod , I 'll be gone for the week ... and I wanted to say good-bye . Why do you go away every year when it turns cold outside ? Business , Jarod . That 's all . If you can keep a secret , I brought you a little something . A gift . A gift ? - This is snow . - Yes . Remember . - Tell no one I gave this to you . - Take me outside , Sydney . - To see the real snow . - I can 't , Jarod . - But I want to see it for myself . - Enjoy this snow . And I will see you again soon . Okay ? - I got you ! - Aah ! [ Laughing ] [ Gasps , Screams ] Let 's get out of here ! [ Both Screaming ] Two kids found her buried in the snow a couple hours ago . [ Guerra ] Now , that 's criminal . Vagrant . After you thaw her , check for needle marks . My prelim is overdose . - I wonder who she is . - We 'll never know . L.G.L. Bag her and tag her . And next time , please ... don 't make me wait . - " L.G.L. " ? - Little girl lost . No witness , no I.D. Her family must be worried sick , wondering where she is . That 's the tragic part . She 's probably a runaway . We get them all the time . Nothin 'to go on , so she becomes a case number . Like all the rest . - Are you okay ? - No . [ Electrical Crackling ] Fascinating , hmm ? Only one twin is wired , but they both feel the shock . I don 't even wanna know . - Cleanup crew just came in from Cleveland . - Any luck ? - Jarod 's last life in a box . - [ Chuckles ] You 're the shrink . Maybe you can figure out their meaning . Jarod 's trying to tell me something . Makes a great greeting card . But face facts , Syd . At this rate , your boy won 't be home for the holidays . Maybe not , but he 'll contact me . He has to . - Well , it is Christmas . - I worry about him . - Out there this time of year . - Relax . He 's probably holed up in Whoville , experiencing the Grinch for the first time . [ Bell Ringing ] Would you like some ? It 's called fruitcake . Fruitcake ? I 'm not that homeless . What , are you writing a book ? Um , no , not exactly . - [ Sighs ] - You miss him , don 't you ? - Who ? - George . Christmas George . - You knew George ? - I feel like I did . George was all the family I had . Well , he was all the family a lot of people had . - The children at the shelter miss him . - Yeah . Foster kids , runaways ... They knew the real George . Oh , everybody thought he was a bum ... because he didn 't have a home , and panhandled to get by . But he took all that money , and one day a year ... he made sure they had presents and a special meal . Every Christmas Eve he 'd dress as Santa ... and read to those kids all night long . That 's why they called him Christmas George . Yeah . When George was alive ... they all had family for at least one day . Christmas doesn 't count for squat without family , son . No . I 'm beginning to realize that . [ Woman ] Oh , there you are , Jarod . I just wanted to thank you for all the work you 've done this season . Without Christmas George , it hasn 't been the same . Oh , I 'm happy to help . For a happy man , you look perplexed . Well , the truth is , I am . - Have you read this ? - [ Chuckles ] " The Night Before Christmas ' " ? - It 's a classic ! - It 's very good , but I 'm a little confused about something . Now , if Santa Claus were to deliver a present to every child on Earth ... he 'd have to visit 830 homes a second . Which would mean his reindeer would have to travel about 700 miles per second ... and he 'd have 1 / 1000th of a second to park the sleigh ... to crawl down the chimney , to pass out the presents and to eat cookies and milk . And for a middle-aged , overweight man , that 's quite a feat . [ Chuckles ] Santa works in mysterious ways . But it 's so fantastical . Why would anybody believe it ? It 's Christmas , Jarod . Anything 's possible . - Oh . - [ Laughs ] Angel , they 're getting ready to string some popcorn . Don 't you want to help ? Don 't you want to talk to Santa ? - He 's not Santa . - Is something wrong ? Is Christmas George coming back ? No . No , he isn 't . Why not ? Christmas George died . Do you know what that means ? We won 't ever see him again . Well , that 's true , and then again , it isn 't . Could I ask you something ? Why did you like Christmas George ? Well , he was nice . And he made sure the kids always had ... something under the tree on Christmas . So what you 're saying is that he had a spirit , a feeling , that made you feel good . Well , as long as you have that feeling , Christmas George is gonna be right here . So every time it 's Christmas , I can think about George , and he 'll be here ? Every time . [ Chuckles ] - Can I help ? - [ Boy ] Sure . Come on . [ Violin : " O Holy Night ' " ] [ Continues ] [ Continues ] [ Dr. Fugimora ] Geez , Jarod . You 've run 137 tests . Any luck on the L.G.L. ? - That 's not her name . - I didn 't mean anything . She should have a real name . Her family should know . Especially at this time of the year . You 're not gonna give up , are you ? [ Male Deejay ] And we 've got more Christmas hits coming your way , so ... snuggle up by the fire with that special someone ... and enjoy the holiday season . [ Ringing ] - What ? - [ Man ] It 's me . I 'm having a holiday gathering at the club . It wouldn 't be the same without my favorite girl . - I 'll be there . - Very well . Christmas Eve at 7 : 00 . - European associates will attend . Be prompt . - Of course , Daddy . - Merry Christ ... - [ Line Disconnects ] [ Beeps ] [ Woman On P.A. , Indistinct ] - Gunshot wound to the gill ? - [ Laughs ] Not a patient . - Lunch . - Aren 't you a little young for poison fish ? - Puffer fish is only poison before it 's prepared . - Kim . - Fugu toxin is 500 times stronger than cyanide . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . But when it 's done right , all you get are tingly toes and a great buzz . Christmas dinner around here . My fugu 's a tradition . The boys in the morgue love it . And it goes great with cranberries . I 'll stick with fruitcake . And relax . My uncle was a master fugu chef in Tokyo . - Was ? - He 's retired . [ Laughs ] Oh , good . Well , I 'm glad to hear that . - Uh , would you help me with this ? - Man , did you spill a whole mug ? Well , actually , I spilled a whole pot . - I 'll get you a duplicate . - Oh , no , no , no . That 's okay . Just show me where the old files are . - [ Chattering , Phones Ringing ] - [ Woman ] It should take a few seconds ... to start working . Yes , I 've already dispatched the ambulance . Ma 'am ... Ma 'am . ! No . An overflowing toilet is not a 911 call . Ma 'am . Would you please hang up and call a plumber ? [ Speaking With Mouth Full ] Okay . You need to ... induce vomiting . Yes . Uh , no , your finger will be fine . - Yes . - [ Man ] It 's not working . It 's not working . Your son is going to be fine , Mr. Hodges , if you just listen carefully . - Okay . - [ Jarod ] Now , remember , clear the airway ... - and tilt his head back . - Right . Tilt his head back . - Now back to the breathing . - Okay . [ Beeping ] - [ Hodges ] Okay . - Now , continue the up and down motion on his chest . - Okay . Five-count ? - Yes . - [ Beeping ] - [ Hodges ] Oh , my God . He 's breathing . ! - My son is breathing . ! - That 's fantastic , Mr. Hodges . They 're here ! The ambulance just got here . You see ? That wasn 't so difficult . - Merry Christmas . - Thank you so much . Thank you . - [ Woman On Tape ] 911 Operator . - Hello . My name 's Harry . I 'm calling from the corner of Lawson and Hill . My friend ... Oh , God , my friend George is ... - [ Woman ] Tell me what the problem is , sir . - They ran George down . You gotta get somebody down here . Lawson and Hill . Right in front of the children 's shelter . - Hurry . You gotta hurry . - [ Operator ] I 'm calling it in , sir . - Is anyone else hurt ? - No , they just hit him , and they left . I didn 't see no car . - This is where it happened ? - Where I found him . They just left George there to die . - " They " ? - I don 't know . Crash woke me up . I didn 't see it . I 'm sorry . I never left his side . Never . Not until the coroner showed up . - The coroner ? - [ Sniffles ] Not the police ? Better directions , I guess . [ Sighs ] You know , he held my hand , and ... And we got to say good-bye . You mean , he didn 't die instantly ? Ah , hell no . He was a fighter . Coroner tried to save him . Gave George a shot and everything , but ... Didn 't help . I never knew coroners carried doctor bags . Neither did I. She did what she could , I guess . But by the time the cops got here ... - she told them George had passed . - She ? - Was she alone ? - Yep . - And she had red hair . - Uh , yeah . How 'd you know ? [ Woman On P.A. ] Any available assistance to the I. V. Unit . Why haven 't you shipped the L.G.L. ? We need slab space for the holidays . - I found stress fractures in her legs . - Forget about it . We 've done our due diligence . - Finish up the paperwork and send her along . - I understand . By the way , new guy works Christmas Eve . Don 't worry about it . Last year was so slow , we broke out a bottle of Christmas cheer . Too bad I won 't be here with you to share a toast . Well , you never know , Doctor . Christmas has its way of bringing people together . [ Jarod ] OurJane Doe 's real name is Gabrielle . Gabrielle Ryan . She 's from Nashton . She would have been 18 next month . How 'd you do this ? Lower tibial fractures to the medial malleoli . - Media who ? - Bad ankles . From compression impacts . That , and she had callous patterns on her hands like this . Parallel bars were her specialty . Will you tell her family right away ? Count on it . Hey . Good work , Jarod . See you around . [ Women 's Choir : " Coventry Carol ' " ] Face it , Sydney . It 's almost Christmas . He 's not going to call . [ Sighs ] I see you 're clearing out for your usual holiday hiatus ... so , here . A Christmas present ? From you ? Don 't go hanging mistletoe . See you after the first . And a merry Christmas to you too , Miss Parker . - Kim . - Hey . Hi . I was going over last year 's duty roster ... and I see that you were working on Christmas Eve . I was the rookie last year . That means that this year , you get to wait up for Santa . [ Laughs ] I don 't mind working the holiday . The truth is , I 've never really had Christmas Eve off . I wanted to ask you about the autopsies that were performed that night . - Shoot . - According to the files , there were only two . A homeless hit-and-run victim named Christmas George ... and an 80-year-old woman named Edwina Morris . - Do you remember them ? - I remember the Morris woman . Dead ringer for Grandma Walton . Only fat . But I really wasn 't involved in the hit-and-run . I thought you were the only one on duty that night . I was , until Drake came in with the hit-and-run . She did that autopsy . The chief coroner came in on Christmas Eve ... to perform an autopsy on a homeless man ? With karma like hers , she 's probably not that popular on the party circuit ... if you know what I 'm sayin ' . The other body . Edwina Morris . - Was she a psych patient ? - No . Just a very large grandmother of six ... who died of natural causes . - Why ? - According to the toxicology report ... there were traces of phenotripticol in her blood . - Phenotripticol ? - Yes . Isn 't that used to subdue patients during psychotic episodes ? And in stronger doses , it induces a state of paralysis ... where the patient is conscious , but rendered immobile . - Dead . But not dead . - Oh , my God . Please don 't tell me that I performed an autopsy on someone who was alive ... - and conscious ! - No . No . - You didn 't . - Well , this couldn 't have happened . Someone must have messed up the toxicology reports . Or switched them . On purpose . [ Women 's Choir : " What Child Is This ? ' " ] [ Ends ] - You 're Miss Parker , aren 't you ? - I didn 't know anyone was here . - Please don 't tell anyone I was here . - No , wait . Why did you come ? My mom lets me see the rabbits when no one 's here . I want one , but my father won 't let me have pets at home . [ Young Jarod ] We 've been studying them . There are three sets of twins . Now watch . They 've never been together before . But somehow , the ones that are genetically identical just seem to find each other . Like something inside them draws them together . See ? They 're soft . [ Door Latch Rattling ] [ Car Alarm Beeping ] - Excuse me . Can you sp ... - Not my neighborhood . [ Starting Engine ] [ Engaging Gears ] - [ Screams ] - [ Grunts ] Oh , my God . Didn 't you see me ? Jarod ! [ Grunting ] I 'm okay . I 'm okay . It was just a ... a little scratch . - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . Come on . l-I can help you out with that . - [ Panting ] - You certainly come prepared . Our patients may be dead , but we 're still doctors , right ? - I suppose . - I always keep it on hand . You never know when somebody might need one of us . You never know . - [ Beeps ] - [ Whirring ] Why , Jarod . I thought they 'd taken you back to your room . - What are those , Sydney ? - They 're another project I 'm working on . - [ Buzzing ] - [ Woman ] Your car is ready to take you ... - to the Mount Pleasant Home . - Yes . Thank you . Tell them to wait . [ Young Jarod ] You will come back , won 't you , Sydney ? [ Young Sydney ] I always come back , Jarod . Don 't I ? [ Whirring ] [ Woman ] Your car is ready to take you to the Mount Pleasant Home . Yes , thank you . ... take you to the Mount Pleasant Home . [ Beeps ] [ Woman ] Your car is ready to take you to the Mount Pleasant Home . I 'll be right there . [ Big Band : " God Rest You Merry , Gentlemen ' " ] [ Line Ringing ] Last Minute Gifts ? I need a last minute gift . Dr. Fugimora ? Well , I hate to be the bearer ofbad tidings ... but you 're going to need to come to work today . Something terrible has happened . I 'll explain everything when you get there . Don 't you love Christmas ? - It 's so Christmasy . - Jarod , I thought you were working today . I am . But I wanted to give you a little something . - For me ? - Mm-hmm . Open it . [ Sighs , Scoffs ] Fruitcake . [ Sniffs ] This actually smells good . I was so impressed with the mayor 's gift , I tried baking one myself ... and I want you to be the first to taste it . [ Sighs ] - Mmm ? - Oh , no thank you . Mmm . Mmm ! It 's actually good . So , um , are you gonna see your family for the holidays ? I don 't think that 's going to be possible this year . Are you okay ? I ... feel a little ... My God ! [ Retching ] Dr. Drake ? Let me help you . [ Gasping , Groaning ] My stomach ! My God ! [ Gasping ] - What was in that cake ? - I went to great pains making that cake . - It couldn 't have possibly been the ... - What ? - Uh-oh . - What ? Well , Fugimora has been teaching me how to prepare puffer fish . And I was practicing when I was making the fruitcake . And some of it might have accidentally slipped into the batter . - Puffer fish ? - I 'm afraid so . You idiot ! You poisoned me ! - [ Grunting In Pain ] - I 'm sorry . - Call 911 . - Okay . - [ Cell Phone Beeping ] - Uh ... - I can 't . - Jarod , what are you doing ? - I can 't call 911 . - Are you crazy ? No , but I am thorough . If I call 911 , they 'd be able to help you . But they could hurt me . - What ? - They would come out , they would see that you were sick ... and they would realize that I accidentally poisoned you . And that could cost me my career . [ Moaning , Gasping ] You can 't do this . - You can 't do this . - [ Recorder Clicking ] - [ Operator ] Tell me what the problem is , sir . - [ Harry ] They ran George down . You gotta get somebody down here . Lawson and Hill . Right in front of the children 's shelter . Hurry . You gotta hurry . - I 'm calling it in , sir . Is anyone else hurt ? - No . They just hit him and left . - [ Clicks Off ] - You 're a coroner . Your business is dead people . Even when you 're the one who kills them . Right , Doctor ? Did you have a little too much to drink at last year 's Christmas party ? Can you imagine how Christmas George must have felt when you hit him with your car ... and left him in the snow ? He went into the alley to recover , and you heard over your police scanner ... that he was still alive . You couldn 't have that , could you ? That could hurt your precious career . So you went back to the scene , before the police got there . Now , you didn 't have anything in your bag that would actually kill him ... but you did have something that would paralyze him . He was conscious of everything that was happening to him ... but he looked dead to the police . He was just a homeless man . You figured , no one would miss him , right ? But like you always say , bag ' em and tag ' em . [ Mumbling ] No . Don 't do that . I 'm not really dead . Well , if it makes you feel any better , I 'm not really a coroner . [ Voice Echoing ] But everybody thinks I am . So I 'm just going to declare you dead . And they can finish you off . On the slab . Just like you finished off George . Merry Christmas . [ " Jingle Bells , ' " Off-tempo ] [ Voice Distant ] Wow . I never got to work on a boss before . We 'll start cutting on her after lunch . Who wants puffer fish ? The effects of the phenotripticol should wear off in a few hours . She 's gonna wake up with a wicked case of diarrhea from the fruitcake . - Merry Christmas , Jarod . - Merry Christmas . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Knocking ] Merry Christmas . He said to give you this . He who ? Excuse me . Dr. Marley ? - Yes ? - I 'm Timothy . Timothy Ryan . Gabrielle 's brother . I just wanted to say ... Well , this detective said you identified her . - Went the extra mile , he said . - I 'm sorry that it took so long . And I 'm sorry that you had to find out at this time . I 'm not . Imagine wondering a lifetime if someone you love is out there or not . Thank you for saving my family that hell . Thank you . [ Children 's Choir : " Silent Night ' " ] - [ Ends ] - [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Ringing ] - [ Clears Throat ] Hello . Daddy , hello . I was just getting ready ... [ Piano : " Silent Night ' " ] I understand . No . We 'll do it next year . - [ Beeps ] - [ Exhales ] Merry Christmas . - [ Continues ] - [ Footsteps ] [ Woman ] He 's ready now . You know , I admire you , Sydney . For 30 years , he just lies there , and yet you 've never missed a Christmas . It 's all I can do . He 's the only family I have . - What about your son ? - My son ? Yes . Jarod . Jarod was here ? He stayed just long enough to leave the gift . I don 't know what he said to him ... but when he placed that in his hand , I swear I thought I saw your brother smile . [ Chuckles ] [ Jarod ] " ' Twas the night before Christmas ... " and all through the house , not a creature was stirring ... - " not even a mouse . - [ Chuckles ] " The stockings were hung by the chimney with care ... " in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there . " The children were nestled all snug in their beds ... " while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads . " And Mama in her kerchief , and I in my cap ... " hadjust settled down for a long winter 's nap . " When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter ... " I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter . " Away to the window I flew like a flash ... " tore open the shutters and threw up the sash . " When what to my wondering eye should appear ... " but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer . " With a little old driver , so lively and quick ... " I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick . " And he whistled , and shouted , and called them by name : " " Now , Dasher . ! Now , Dancer . ! Now , Prancer and Vixen . ! " On , Comet . ! On , Cupid . ! On , Donder and Blitzen . ! ' " He sprang to his sleigh , to his team gave a whistle ... " and away they all flew like the down of a thistle . " But I heard him exclaim , ere he drove out of sight ... " Happy Christmas to all , and to all a good night . " ' [ Giggling ] - [ Sleigh Bells Jingling ] - Did you hear that ? - [ Girl , Gasping ] What ? - From the other room . - Could it be ... - [ Children ] Santa ! [ Girl ] Let 's go in the other room . ! Under the tree . ! [ Chattering ] A present for me ? - I wonder who it 's from ? - Let 's see what you got . What 's it say ?

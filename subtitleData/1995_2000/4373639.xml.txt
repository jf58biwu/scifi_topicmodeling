 - We 're cutting it pretty close . - Man , I don 't wanna miss my ride . - The Mac Arthur will wait for us . - They gotta wait . I 've been T.D.Y. On Groombridge 34 since April . - You goin ' Earthside ? - Haven 't seen my wife since before the war . She 's probably forgotten what I look like . I know . I know . In my case , maybe that 's a good thing . Still , it 'll be nice to have dinner at home . Man , would I love a meal that wasn 't freeze-dried . - Just havin ' a break 's gonna be good . - [ Laser Fire ] Take cover ! Take cover . ! Chig snipers in the tower . ! Chig snipers in the tower ! Cooper , Monk , cover the right flank . Vansen , West , take the left . Monk , keep down ! Medic ! No . Come on . - Hold on ! - I 'm not gonna die . Not yet . Please , not yet . [ Clamoring ] - Medic ! - Cooper , don 't leave me . Don 't let me die alone . Two migs morphine . Lasix , 80 mills , I.V. Push . - Vitals ? - His name 's Solomon Monk . He doesn 't need a doctor , Lieutenant . He needs a rabbi . - L-Look , maybe there 's a chance - - These men have a chance . Tell my wife I don 't mind goin ' except for her . Sh-She was my - my wife . Cooper . ! We 're takin 'off in five . We 're hitching 'a ride on a cargo ship . He 's dead . His family will want these . Come on . Let 's go . [ Man Over Radio ] 58th , you 're clear for docking . Captain Lewelyn , I 'm Colonel McQueen ... 58th Air Commando Group en route from Fire Base Langston to the carrier Saratoga . I waited for you , Colonel . I didn 't want you to miss your ride . - How bad is it down below ? - Langston 's still hot . I lost a good man to a sniper tonight . We have new orders . Our course will take us through Blood Alley . It 's dangerous , but it 's the only way out . [ Lewelyn ] I don 't suppose there 's a chance of a fighter escort ? - Not in this lifetime . - Careful of that ! Sixteen pounds prime rib . - Black market . - What 'd that cost you ? I traded my only 1986 Dan Fouts card . Better be pretty good prime rib . InVitros . [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Man ] You 've come to the right place . Every man down here 's a Tank . - J.J. Keats . - Hawkes . Cooper Hawkes . Ashby ! The engine room foreman . - Howdy . - Sorrell , Chief Engineer . - Everyone on the crew a Tank ? - Six of us . Seven humans including the captain . Computers do the rest of the work . Ever notice how Tanks always get the dirty jobs ? Isn 't that why we were made ? You got that right . You did good for yourself . There 's no trick becoming chief petty officer on a tramp steamer . Do the dirty jobs , keep your mouth shut , go along . Captain Lewelyn - better than most . I got a standing invitation to take meals in the captain 's mess . Most of the cargo is humans suspended in cryogenic sleep . They put you under , five years later , you wake up . It 's the next day of your life . We 're carrying six containers of unborn InVitros . They 're being shipped to a plutonium mining facility ... in the Corvus star system . They don 't stand a chance . What 're a few Tanks , more or less ? - Do you know who they are ? - Right now they 're just numbers on a cargo manifest . Can 't believe InVitros are still being shipped like that . Set course for the Canis Majoris star system . Plotting course for Canis Majoris star system . - Bring us to 260 A.U. ' s . - Aye , aye , sir . 260 A.U. ' s . Plot course heading 2-1-fiver . That 's Blood Alley . The nav-channel 's 200 klicks wide . Things change , Potter . There 's a war on . Captain , that course takes us between Adhara and Aludra . The hydrogen gasses play havoc with the radio communication . The solar flares screw up the onboard computers . It 's the fastest way from Groombridge 34 ... - to the battleship Saratoga . - I don 't recall hiring on for a suicide mission . When I give an order , Mr. Potter , be so good as to follow it . Plot a course heading 2-1-fiver , Mr. Harkin . All ahead full , Mr. Mercer . All ahead full . [ McQueen ] Quite a cargo you 've got here . First five years out of the tank ... I worked the uranium mines at Omicron Draconis . Thirty four of us were shipped out . Six came back . I don 't know if there 's a hell , but if there is , I 've already been there . That was before the World Federation banned indentured servitude , Colonel . The InVitros I 'm hauling signed on for the job . You have a cargo of unborn , Captain . What did they sign on for ? [ Man 's Voice ] Janice loved your present . I took her to Detroit Disneyland for her birthday . She loved Mr. Toad 's Wild Ride . I miss you . You 're still my favorite wild ride . - My boyfriend 's little girl . - She 's cute . Yeah . She still misses her mother though , big time . She 'll learn to love you . Love isn 't learned , Nathan . It just is . [ Shane ] How can you fall in love with someone you 've never met ? Martie and I talk every day . You met her through a personals ad in SpaceNet , Wang . [ Chuckles ] You don 't even know what she looks like . I love the way she thinks . She 's got a great sense of humor . Okay , let 's say that you guys get along great at seven light-years . What happens when you have to sit across a table eye to eye ? How will you know how to act with each other ? Is that a question or a confession ? You writing ' Monk 's wife ? How do you know what to put ? I tell his wife he was a good man and will be missed . Is that what it says in the regs ? No . That 's what it says here . How do you know what humans are feeling ? I see the laughter and tears , and I know . I don 't feel that stuff . They take us out of the tank at 18 , Hawkes . You can 't get 18 years back in a day . Do you ever wonder what it would be like ... to have a mother or a father ? I don 't think about what never was . But ... it don 't bother you that when you die ... there 's gonna be no blood relation there to say words over you ? The Corps is my family , Hawkes . The men and women I served with will know what to say . Yeah , you got that right . It 's great to have real food , Captain . [ Cooper ] Captain ... the invitro manifest - - Cooper , not now . - I 'd like to see it . You know what he 's tryin ' to do , Captain . The same thing they all do - look for family . No offense , but , uh ... how can something grown in a tank consider itself related to anything else ? Except maybe algae . Stuff a sock in it , Potter . - [ Rumbling ] - [ Clamoring ] What the hell - Take a damage control team aft . Secure the cargo hold . - [ Beeping ] - Coolant temp 's spiked to 700 ! - Step the rods down . - Got it . - Take it off-line . - Going off-line . [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Man Over P.A. ] Generator Room , go to secondary power . All right , come on , Clyde . Don 't fail me now . Backup generators have kicked in . Engine Room , Bridge . Reactor 's scrammed . We 're off line . Core 's unstable . - What hit us ? - Solar flare . What else can one expect when flying between two unstable suns ? - I want you midship with Keats . - Yes , sir . - What 's your weapons package ? - Two laser pulse cannons , unmanned . Vansen ! Wang ! With your permission , Captain . Just in case that wasn 't a solar flare . Under the circumstances , I think there 's room for two on the bridge . - Damphousse . - I know , Colonel . Engine room . Hawkes , I want you to go work with Keats . I want one of us on damage control . - Keats is one of us . - He 's a civilian . We 're marines . And Hawkes , forget the invitro manifest . The 58th is your family . Looking for a past you never lived can only get you hurt . Feeling pain 's part of being human . Who said you 're human ? [ Alarm Blaring ] Hey , where 're you goin ' ? What about Section 46 ? We don 't inspect it ? People are the priority here . Oh , yeah . I forgot . Tanks aren 't people . Look , you just stay away , pal . You got no business over there . What the hell is going on here ? Navigator was right . White light solar flare . I know what the machine says . What do you say ? - There 's no way to tell . - Trust your instincts , West . That 's how you stay alive . There 's something out there . I can feel it . - [ McQueen ] Engine Room , Bridge . - Core temperature 's stabilized . Estimate to get the reactor on line ? Maybe today . Maybe Malaba Day . - Stored energy ? - [ Sorrel ] 4.5 kilotons in the containment vessel . - Keep the engine on line . - Yes , sir ! Clad temp - 600 . Let 's go back online . Don 't know what caused the coolant temp to spike . It could happen again . Worst thing that can happen is we could blow up , Mr. Ashby . Then I don 't see the problem . The coolant density 's at 800 kilograms over M3 . I think we 're in the clear . Let 's do it . Raise Rod 1 . Rod 1 raised . Raise Rod 2 . [ Ashby ] Rod 2 raised . You know your stuff . Bridge , this is Fire Control . Request permission for a weapons check . [ McQueen ] Fire Control , Bridge . Permission granted . Fire light status - green . - Fire light status - green . - [ McQueen ] Commence firing . Bucks like a mule . West , anything ? I 'd have better luck reading tea leaves , sir . At least tea leaves would tell us something . Let me see that . She the girl you went AWOL for ? Yes , sir . This is behind you . The only thing on your mind is that radar screen . - [ Keats ] I figured you 'd show up . - [ Exhales ] The Tank cargo manifest . The number on the left 's the date of conception . The middle number 's the gene pool . This is the batch number on the right . Place of conception is indicated in the margin . I 've been lookin ' 10 years , Cooper , so I know what you 're feelin ' . You 're wondering what it would be like to have family . Only all the time . What are you ? March 6 , 2040 . Gene pool 16A . Batch Alpha-3439 . The Philadelphia facility . Brooklyn facility . Not that it really matters . All I know is that somewhere there 's someone who 's D.N.A. Reads ... A - T , C-G , T-A , G - C , C-G , A-T - that 's black hair and hazel green eyes . See , I know what my family would be like , but I can 't find them . Enjoy the read . Hand me a reverse torque wrench . Here 's what I think . Human beings are nothing more than highly evolved animals . - Tell that to Einstein . - We 're attracted to a person because the way that they look . The way that they smell . The way that they feel to the touch . Okay , so what 's your point ? How can you fall in love with a woman that you met on SpaceNet ? You don 't believe in the soul ? In spiritual connection ? I believe in what you can reach out and touch . Then reach out and touch that morph head . - [ Nathan ] I 'm getting something . - [ McQueen ] Range and bearing ? Looks like an energy pulse , Colonel . I can 't get an exact reading . - It 's gone . - Just tell me what you saw . I don 't know ! Solar spike . I need to know what 's out there , West . Figure it out . Ceramic fuel temp - 1200 and holding . Bridge , Engine Room . Reactor 's on line . [ McQueen ] Well done , Damphousse . I 'll need full power . - Full power . - So , how come you got detailed down here ? Four years at Caltech . Two summers I interned at San Onofre . What kind of lunatic interns at a nuclear power plant ? My father was chief engineer . Lot of people won 't work with nipple-necks . Let me tell you something , Mr. Ashby . I 'll work with anyone who wants to work . Not a lot of people feel that way . I 'm not a lot of people . What is it with you people ? How can you expect to be a marine ? You can 't follow a simple order ? Huh ? Don 't ever touch me again . Oh , and what 's so special about you ? I got a petri dish . I can always make another Tank . Scram it ! [ Vanessa ] Bridge , Engine Room . Scrammed . - Taking all systems off-line . - Generator Room , Bridge . - Go to secondary power supply . ! - Doing it now . Captain , fire in the generator room . ! Potter , this is the captain . Get a fire team to Station 4 . Help ! Aaah ! - [ Potter ] How bad is it ? - [ Keats ] Bad ! - We gotta get to the emergency shutoff valve . - [ Potter ] Bruckheimer . - Can you get to it ? - Do somethin ' or we 're gonna lose the generator . There 's protective gear in the cargo hold . We don 't have the time . There 's no other way . [ Keats ] Cooper , what 're you doing ? You don 't owe them this , Cooper . [ Man ] Cooper , don 't do it . ! [ Keats ] Protect yourself down there , Coop . Protect yourself . [ Man ] It 's crazy , Cooper . Come on back . Bruckheimer . Cargo hold . - I 'm getting something . - [ McQueen ] What 's its signature ? - There is no signature . - What does your gut tell you , West ? - What 's the level of threat ? - I can 't tell , Colonel , without more information . All I 'm getting are microwave emissions . Enlarge it , West . You happen to remember the U3-78 specs ? What we have here is an unidentified blob . Give me the U3-78 specs ! The U3-78s - uh , alien class " D " destroyer , a hunter-killer . - Weapons package ? - Rockets , mines , guided weapons . - What else ? - Special ops thinks she has ... advanced microwave technology that screw up ... communications . Causes reactor temperatures to spike . - Goes for the soft kill . - My gut tells me ... that your unidentified blob is a U3-78 ... and he 's comin ' in for the hard kill . Sir , I have radar contact . Bearing 276 . Range - two parsecs . Azimuth 4-niner . There 's not enough power to get us out of harm 's way . There 's only one way to take the load off the second generator - cut power to one section of the cargo hold . - You mean kill people . - It 's math , Colonel . One section dies or we all die . Is there really a choice ? Section 46 gives us the most power for the fewest lives . Generator Room , this is Captain Lewelyn . Stand by to cut power to Section 46 . Repeat . Stand by to cut power to Section 46 . Section 46 houses 12 containers of InVitros , Captain . That 's 168 lives . It 's the only way to get the reactor back online . There has to be another way , Captain . That 's an order , Keats . Section 46 . Stand by . McQueen won 't let this happen . He 's one of us . You hear his voice raised in protest just now ? What did you find ? I got a sister in Section 46 . [ Whirring , Grinding ] Engine Room , Bridge . Can you go on line ? - Negative . I can 't give you power . - It 's time to pull the plug . Keats . This is the captain . Cut power to Section 46 . - Negative , Captain . - Just what the hell is the problem ? - I 'm the problem , Captain . - There 's not a lot of room for interpretation in your orders . I won 't do it , Captain . Too many of us have died fighting your wars . You 're putting every life on this ship at risk . Then we die equal . [ Potter ] Keats . ! Some are more equal than others . [ Potter Straining ] Stay right there . Right there . Lift him up . Are you gonna help me save those Tanks ? Because I know one thing - you 're not going to kill your own people . Keats , confirm you 're cutting power to Section 46 . Keats , answer me . Keats , what 's going on ? Cut power , or we 're gonna lose the ship . Keats . ! Keats . ! Do it , man . ! Keats . ! Keats . ! Ceramic fuel temp - 1600 . - Ashby , Sorrell , come here . - Yes , sir . - What 's the problem ? - Sir . Captain 's giving orders to kill the InVitros in Section 46 . - You can 't let him do that . - I can 't stop him ! Not alone . [ Chattering ] [ Beeps , Squawks ] - Missile 's launched ! - Confirm that . They 're off the rails ! Engine Room , Bridge . Give me everything you 've got . [ Vanessa ] 3.6 kilotons thrust . Maximum power . Vansen , Wang ! Missile incoming ! Lock on ! - Bingo ! - We 're locked on . Let 's rock and roll . 2100 klicks . 1800 klicks . Colonel , launch the cargo haulers . The missiles will go for them , not us . Launch starboard cargo haulers . Prepare ship for impact ! Eight , seven , six - Fire ! Come to Mama . - Hard left rudder . - Hard left rudder . [ Lasers Firing ] West , radar contact ? Negative . But the U3-78 's gonna come looking for confirmation of the kill . Good call . I 'm going aft . - Come on . Come on ! - You 're a dead man , Keats . A dead man . I don 't want to kill you . I will if I have to . - What the hell 's going on ? - A change in command . You two stand down . I 'm not taking orders from you . You are now . Stand down . How can you let him kill InVitros ? Our operating systems are down , Hawkes . The captain has no choice . - You can stop him . - The captain 's word is law . When someone decides to kill an InVitro ... it 's not my law , and it shouldn 't be yours . Keats gave you the manifest . - Who 'd you find ? - A sister . How could you kill your own people ? How can you ? Answer me ! - [ Keats ] Captain . ! - [ Cocks Gun ] - I 'm taking the helm . - Are you adding mutiny to your résumé , Mr. Keats ? Mutiny , Captain ? He 's adding murder . - He 'll kill us all . - Whatever it takes . As long as InVitros don 't die . Sit him down . Stay at your post , son . I need you alive . Tell McQueen you need him on the bridge . Tell him ! [ McQueen ] I 'll buy us a little more time . I 'll give Damphousse five minutes ... to get the reactor back on line . If she can 't , I have to pull the plug . [ Lewelyn Over Radio ] Colonel McQueen , report to the bridge . - [ Lewelyn ] You 're makin ' a mistake , Keats . - It won 't be the first , sir . [ Yells ] Don 't even think about it . This isn 't what I wanted . That 's not good enough . Get your men back to their stations . I 'm taking the bridge . - [ Gun Cocks ] - I can 't allow that . [ Cooper ] You are not going to kill him . And you are not going to kill the Tanks . You can 't have it both ways . [ Nathan ] I 'm picking up an active gamma pulse . He 's doing a Yankee search . Yankee search is an old navy term . The bastard who 's hunting us figures we 're a pile of space garbage . He 's coming in to confirm the kill . And right now there 's not a damn thing we can do . Bridge , Fire Control . Fire light status-red . ! Repeat . Fire light red . Get us power . What does the colonel want us to do now ? Throw rocks ? Pretty soon you 're going to have to decide if you 're gonna kill us . - Pulse intervals decreasing . - Clock 's running out , Hawkes . Time to decide . Whose side are you on ? There are no sides , Colonel . Just right and wrong . Give me the gun . The colonel will do the right thing . You have to trust that . Do you , Cooper ? Do you trust him ? Yes . Don 't make it worse . Sir , the bridge is yours . Thank you , Mr. Hawkes . Engine Room , Bridge . We have incoming . Get me back online . No can do . ! Pressure shocks hit the primary system hard . This whole damn thing 's gonna melt down if I don 't get some help here . We work together ... or we die . It 's that simple . I need your help , Mr. Keats . Be good enough to get your men back to the engine room . Fire Control , Bridge . The captain 's dead . We have a class nine emergency . Report to the engine room or the nuclear reactor 's gonna melt down . Maybe later you 'll tell us what the hell is going on . You ever try to do the right thing , only it turns out wrong ? Kick in the emergency core coolant system in ... five , four , three ... two , one - Now ! Reload initiated . [ Exhales ] Glad to have you back . Bridge , Engine Room . 90 minutes to get your reactor back on line . - [ Nathan ] He 's coming right at us . ! - Can 't fight . We can 't run . And your five minutes are up . Now what the hell do you expect me to do ? Cut power to another section . Pop quiz , Hawkes . You cut power to Section 46 , 168 Tanks die . You cut the power to any other section , 400 humans die . Now , how does the math work out ? What do you do ? We 're dead center in the gamma pulse . We have one advantage , Hawkes . The U3-78 doesn 't know we 're ready to fight . Are we ? Are we ready to fight ? [ Machines Whirring ] [ Hawkes Over P.A. ] Power 's cut to Section 46 . We have generator power , sir . Bridge , Fire Control . Fire light green . [ McQueen Over Radio ] Hold your fire until the U3-78 closes . At two klicks , he can 't fire his missiles . Solar flare . I got no screen . We lost the targeting system . The solar flare scrambled the screen . The only way the U3-78 can make contact is visual . Right now , we are not on his radar screen . Estimated time for his radar retrieval - three minutes . We 're blind and he 's blind . Let 's play a little hide-and-seek . Hard left rudder . - Hard left rudder , sir . - Fire Control , Bridge . We don 't know where she is , but she 's out there . Lower the blast shield ! [ Mercer ] Lowering the blast shield , sir . He 's coming right at us . Wang ! Vansen ! Bogey bears 3-3-niner . 1.5 klicks , ayimuth 90 degrees . Weapons hold . Fire perigee kick motor , Mr. Mercer . - Sir , we 'll break up . - Fire perigee kick motor ! - Come on . Give the order . - What 's he waiting for ? Weapons hold . Weapons hold . Now ! Fire ! Fire ! All screens are clear . [ Damphousse ] Pressure 's at 18.5 . Climbing . The core temp 's cooling . Bridge , Engine Room . The reactor 's stabilized . We have 90 mikes until we 're on line . [ McQueen ] Good work , Damphousse . I had a little help from my friends , sir . There 's gonna be hell to pay . It was my call , Sorrell . I 'll take the responsibility . We stand together . - Plot a new course , Mr. Harkin . - Yes , sir . West . Launching the cargo haulers was a great countermeasure . I thought I had to make a point . No . You were right . What I did - going after her - was selfish . It won 't happen again . I know that , West . Thanks . My pleasure . " How many loved your moments of glad grace ... " and loved your beauty with love false or true : " But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you ... and loved the sorrows of your changing face . " Try sending that via SpaceNet . The way I figure it , if you 've had bad times and joy ... then you 've lived . No , the way I see it ... you 'll only end up with a broken heart , and I don 't have the time . You did the right thing . We 're marines , Cooper . Not Tanks . What 's gonna happen to Keats ? Keats and Ashby will stand trial for mutiny . Sorrell , for murder . Sorry f - I 'm sorry . What would you know about sorrow ? I know this much . I never had the ... courage to look for my family . Not because I was afraid of what I might find ... but because I was afraid of what I might feel . Kate . Kate . I 'm sorry . [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

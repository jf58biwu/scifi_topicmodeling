 It 's a nice night ... A helicopter is approaching from 2740 it 's not showing the code number . Are they coming to get our target ? Reconfirm everyone 's location . you confirm the helicopter . Roger . I 've got confirmation on the helicopter . I have everyone 's location . We 'll have to start the mission early . We 've got big game . Are you ready ? Go ... We loaded up everything on schedule . A Landmate ! Please hide in the back . I 'll handle it . One of three men near the bow is moving toward the center . That 's Hassan . There 's white noise all over the sensors . I can 't scan the ship ! try the gravity shift . it 's no good ! Gravity and PNT don 't work ! Dispatch is red ! it 's a scan-shield . They must be generating it somewhere nearby . We have to get the Landmates first . I know there 's someone else here ! Come on out ! don 't be off guard ! Don 't worry . Kei ! is that it ? I 've never seen this type . watch out ! Alissa ... Marcia ! shoot ! Kei ! The rubber bullets don 't work ! A Cyborg ? What was that ? This is serious ! shoot ! Kei ! right ? Get out slowly . right ? How did you know I was inside ? he still smells the same . Who are you ? we 're a private enterprise . We don 't need to read you legal rights or let you call a lamer . Angel Arms . I 'll remember that . We confiscated five Landmates . Two of them were badly damaged . Weapons and ammunition are kept all over the ship but we have no details yet . We were supposed to confiscate all the Landmates in perfect condition . isn 't it ? I was surprised . We were beaten completely . What a good team ! Why don 't you become my new bodyguards ? I 'll pay you as much as you want . but no thanks . Takako Houraiji . Nice to meet you . Too bad ... how long has it been since the jamming began ? What ? Evacuate the ship ! I see ... The evidence was wiped out . How about Hassan ? but why did this deal come up ? Find out about Hassan . we have to kill him . Before everything is out in the open ... This tea needs something ... What the hell ! Captain Endo . Shut up ! You 're not in a position to lecture me ! We can 't use the pier for three weeks because of that smuggling ship sinking ! The city police headquarters is swamped with protests ! not us . they had antitank weapons and Landmates . it 's a breach of the law . Where is the evidence ? But we caught an important man . He is a major league weapon merchant from behind the scenes . Ali Jaiebu Hassan ... Commissioner ? Let me introduce you . Mr. Goman . I 'm Captain Endo . I 've heard about your heroic actions when you were in SWAT . Stop it . That was long ago . Yeah ... is that him ? How come no one wanted to go out ? Takako would have treated all of us . I can 't eat Italian food . it 's gross . Okonomiyaki is the kind of food I like . Silvia ? Okinawa . That 's why I eat Irabu and Gouya . But you guys don 't need to feel bad . Everything is Alissa 's fault . She still hasn 't really become one of the team . We can 't get paid . Our business license was suspended for one week ... Everything is because of her . Our company is operating in the red ! we are . we shouldn 't put the blame on her ... what 're you saying ? Everything is because of Alissa ! She pisses me off ! bring us another serving ! I can shoot if it 's a simulation ... did you finish with the repairs ? I need a little more time ... I have to check some parts . How long will it be ? I don 't see what the problem is . it 's not like I drive the way Alissa does or anything ... I don 't think Alissa is a bad pilot . but her balance is even . You drive in a more peculiar way . Peculiar ? Yes . You handle it rough at crucial moments . Alissa gets along with Doluche and her piloting ... so maybe that 's why ... Silvia is the roughest pilot . She breaks hers once every three times . You 're awfully attentive ... I don 't know anything except machines . Alissa is the best at mastering her Landmate . though ... Let go of me ! You 'll be shot ! Jean Luc ! I won 't let you go by yourself . Alissa ! man . She collapsed . Take her to the police hospital . Tell them to prepare for a cyber-operation . It doesn 't seem like the redevelopment plan ... especially after the two earthquake disasters . There are too many priorities . You want to break open this smuggling ring so you 're going to protect Hassan . That I understand ... But does he want us to light them ? too . Will you accept his terms ? the mayor is planning to do so . A dignitary from the central government might be involved . A dignitary ? We believe he is an influential politician in the Control Party . There is no evidence . The pressure is strong . He would win in court . if you destroy the enemy mobile troops they 'll be temporarily immobilized . I 'll get him . huh ? I 'll help you as much as I can . I can 't deal with a power game among statesmen . Who do you think made your Angel team ? Your boss the great mayor of Bayside city . But my girls risk their lives . I know ... But you have to follow our instructions . Look at this . This footage is from the airport yesterday . His name on the passport is Arthur Jones . He is British . He 's cute . His real name is Jean Luc Skinner . He is the leader of a terrorist group known as Sekundaty . Jean Luc ... Then he was Alissa 's ... He was Alissa 's lover . he is a worldwide terrorist for hire . his accomplices have slipped into town . So you want us to be Hassan 's bodyguards ... The Angels exist for this kind of thing . The mayor requested help from the garrison of Bayside military base even though he hates the military . I should drop Alissa from the team . She doesn 't fit in with everyone else . No . it 's possible that she will endanger our mission . it 's better if all of you Learn to work together ... All live together ... what do you think ? I 'll charge you a lot . That 's why we can never fix the Ferris wheel . Automatic driving clear . right now . especially Jean Luc . Hassan is restricted to city police headquarters . The private Angel Arms company is in charge of guarding him . Why did you request a private company 's help ? You have the city police and our military force . This company arrested Hassan . Hassan belongs to this company until the trial finishes My police forces have already executed a Roller Operation across Bayside City . They 're like mice in a trap . Don 't take them lightly Captain Shiberagi ... I never called you . The Cabinet Security Council called us in since we are the Special Terrorism Countermeasure Forces . From General Kazama ? He told me to help some guys who weren 't getting anything important done . What ? it 's our jurisdiction . Keep out of it ! That 's absurd . Please be quiet . I 'll request the Special Forces with the military to prevent any misunderstanding . The city police and the military must work side by side to prevent terrorism from happening . You have a great view of the airport from here . I helped myself . Takako ... I want to show you something . This is footage from the airport yesterday . it 's the man ... two years ago . now . His purpose is to find and kill Hassan . We got our orders from Goman . Protect Hassan and kill any attackers . Are you going to drop me from the team ? Goman said not to . Goman said so ? does Goman really believe I won 't betray him ? I don 't know ... I can only tell you that it 's your job to protect Hassan ... You have colleagues all of Angel Team . You 've hurt so many people . That was your life . you finally found a way to live as a human being . I think Goman was raised to believe in that kind of thing . Nice watch ... it still works perfectly ... Are you like that ? Takako ? it 's your decision ... Maybe I would choose the man I loved ... I wouldn 't regret my decision . The mission briefing is tomorrow morning at 6 : 00 if you don 't come ... you 'll have to leave the team . How could you smuggle all this in such a short time ? This is nothing . it 's just a sample of what we can acquire . I see . right ? but we don 't want it to happen again . That 's why we called you . where is he ? I think we can figure that out . Perfect ... it 's already 7 : 00 What happened to Alissa ? She 's never been late before . Something may have happened to her . after all it will be easier to work without her . I suppose it would be a waste of time to wait for Alissa . though . Please go to the police headquarters as planned . I 'll leave the mission specifics to Kei . All right . Alissa ... I 'm late . She 's cold as ice . Let 's go . don 't be so slow ! Don 't let the soldiers steal all the credit ! E4 . check . One more game . How many times would you like to lose ? I 'll win next time . old man . How long do I have to entertain this man ? I don 't know . The sky is becoming overcast . You guys should get ready . They will be showing up soon . Don 't talk nonsense ! How could you know ? Allah . We have several simultaneous explosions . They set bombs all over . We 'll be able to successfully dispose of some but we can 't manage all of them . How bad is the city ? Thousands of casualties . I just talked to the central government . I 'm announcing a state of emergency in Bayside City . it 's begun . standby ! Okay ! the Terrorism Countermeasures Headquarters is requisitioning stall to emergency areas ! You idiot ! Their real target is Hassan ! I can 't remain shorthanded here ! Please take responsibility ! Captain ! The radar isn 't working ! Stupid ! Don 't depend on a machine ! Use your eyes ! They 're coming from above ! hot ! Two big machines . Only two ? Alissa and I will stop them . You guys move Hassan just in case . wait ! Where are you taking Hassan ? but we don 't have time for you . I 've never seen either type . I 'll take care the big one . You get the thin one . I got it . their armor is very thick . Yes . Damn armor ! do you ? Come on ! Once more ! My Thermoptic Camouflage ... it 's all over ... Dammit ! My Optical Sensors aren 't working . it 's okay . They can 't light anymore . Our target is Hassan . Let 's go . Where is Hassan ? D-Don 't move ! You 're surrounded ! Stop resisting ! Checkmate ? No way ... it 's better to make it simple . Complicated devices lead to mistakes . Pick it up . it 'll explode . in about fifteen seconds ... Alissa ! Alissa ... Jean Luc ... What 're you doing ? She 's an old friend of mine . it 's time ! Let 's go . What the ... An old friend ? What a bad day ... So good ... The Japanese just don 't understand ... He 's pretty fearless guy ... he 's been like that . Kei and Alissa are taking their time ... Don 't worry . what are you doing ? I 'm hacking the Public Safety Department computer . What ? I did it ! what the hell are you doing ? she 'll take it out of your salary Haven 't you noticed how little information we have on the enemy this time ? information ? Takako give us all kinds of details about the enemy 's capabilities . You don 't think Takako is hiding something from us ? Do you ? Only possibility . But information is important ... we can 't plan a strategy . Now your acting like a member of the Angels ! it 's because of Kei . Not me ? Mister ? I 've always wondered what information the Japanese Safety Department has . Whatever . Just get dressed . I found it ! Rubuyert ... You are evil-looking . I have a request for the Safety Department ! Change my photo ! Can 't you be quiet ? Sekundaty ... What 's that ? This is the information on the terrorist group led by Jean Luc . it says that Jean Luc was killed in during a failed bank robbery . That 's too bad . What ? What the ... Alissa Takakura ... What ? They knew each other . That 's why Takako didn 't give us any information . Takako asked me one time when she was drunk that if my boyfriend died because he was tying to protect me would I ever be able to forget about him ? Maybe that was about Alissa . They 're back . what happened ? It looks like Alissa saved her life when her Landmate was destroyed . Where is Alissa ? She was taken ... By her old friend ? I guess ... They 're smarter than you guys . Honored residents of Bayside City ... Please remain calm at all times . Everything is under control . I need the cooperation of every citizen to prevent any more confusion . We are doing our best to deal with the terrorists . Are you awake now ? Jean Luc ? I 've been looking for you for two years ... Why are you alive ? God must have thought I was too young to die . Although my body has became lake like yours ... did Hassan buy you ? it 's just a coincidence . a bouncer ? What 's wrong ? Stop it . It doesn 't suit you . Only idiots work as bodyguards . You should be with me . We should have fun like before . What about Hassan ? I have to kill him . That 's my job . huh ? I 'm going to put on a big show . You haven 't changed at all . Neither have you . See ? He has a younger brother in Little Arabia ? Get ready to move . Yes ! wait here . yeah ... You had this old watch ... I guess it 's okay for you to hold onto it . if you don 't want him to kill you don 't even think about escaping . the 23rd corollary is broken . can you hold it there ? You 're a slave driver . right ! That 's my line . Brother ... Ivan ? Can you leave tomorrow morning ? No one wants to help you in this town . I 'm sorry I got you involved . I never wanted to see you again . My brother ran a smuggling operation ... I couldn 't approve ! I heard Rubuyert was very careful when it chose from potential clients . I never sell to any organization known to kill children or hurt innocents . That 's my way . people still die . My name is Kelvelos . You are my master . Good boy . The girl escaped ! What ? What are you gonna do ? Alissa ... You 've grown up ... Jean Luc ! Access the Public Safety mainframe . Find the address of Hassan 's brother . That was last . master . Go there at top speed . We 've got two unidentified Landmates . Jean Luc must be in one of them . The rubber bullets won 't effect their armor . They 're both excellent combatants . otherwise we can 't win . I-I can 't ! Fighting isn 't my strong point ! ! What 're you talking about ? so we won 't have enough people if you don 't come with us ! You lour need to light together while Alissa is missing . Do you think Alissa is all right ? Stop it . They 're not the enemy . Alissa ... Don 't scare me like that ! Are you okay ? Yes . Jean Luc will attack any time now . Wait a minute ... right ? Why didn 't you tell us that ? don 't you ? Well ? Give it up ! Silvia . Alissa didn 't betray her team-mates . I don 't give a crap ! is that your judgment as our leader ? I wouldn 't be here right now . I can 't trust her . How about me ? What ? Trust me just this once . whatever . I have to get ready ... me too ! She 's not really a bad person . I know . Ryo said you 're the best Landmate pilot . That 's my job . too . Alissa ... Don 't burn yourself out . I 'm not just saying that as your leader . because you 're my teammate . Okay ... too . We have to be careful because those two are terrible . is that it ? Excuse me ! Here we are ... The Crimson Tailel company made these high-performance Landmates in 2098 . both scrapped at the Bayside Base . Bayside Base ? Doesn 't the military manage that ? Commander Tomioka ... What group took care of it ? It was the anti-terrorism unit . The anti-terrorism unit is an independent organization they are totally out of our jurisdiction at Bayside Base . Who is in charge of waste disposal ? Captain Shiberagi . Captain Shiberagi ? Mayor ? Find him ! Immediately ! that should tie them up ! Aim for Hassan . He 's our only target . the guards there won 't just be regular bouncers . One Landmate has Thermoptic Camouflage . That 'll make it more fun to crush them . Don 't be rushed . You can 't command me ! Let me do it my way . wasn 't it ? Set lire to any suspect shelters and burn them down . kill them even they 're women and children . Hey ! That weapon is just a prototype ! I don 't care . I 'll just test it for you . Do whatever you want ! What happened ? did you fix them ? I did whatever I could . That 's good enough . You 're driving the truck . M-Me ? it 'll be fine ! Why are they destroying the town just to find me ? We 'll just have to get out of here right away . Ryo ... I don 't know if ... Move it ! I wouldn 't have come if I knew this was going to happen . This area is like a labyrinth ... it 'll take them time to catch us . Turn right . Next left . Turn right . Up above ! Right ! That 's him ! One of the monsters ! ram it ! No way ! Step on the gas ! Get down ! Targeting mode ... Locked on ! I did it ! Let 's get out of here ! Commissioner ! Hassan 's younger brother lives in the city . in Little Arabia ! That 's it ! You guys just take it easy . I 'll take care of this . Why ? Why did they pull out ? That was easy ... did they ? Be careful . They won 't give up so easily . I 'm detecting a plasma reaction ! it 's very close ! What ? incoming ? Get down ! Alissa ! I 'm all right ... I guess this weapon hasn 't been perfected yet . Mama ! L-Look out ! Wait ! Brother ! don 't go ! ... He saved me the trouble . Stop it ! Brother ! don 't get in my way . Jean Luc ... Don 't disturb me . Alissa ! you terrorists ! This is the Bayside City Police . Disarm and surrender at once . An army is right behind us . There 's no use resisting . Disarm and surrender at once . Small fry ... retreat ! I 'll finish in a minute . it 's an order from above ! Don 't make the disturbance any worse ! Damn ! Alissa ! Hold on ! Alissa ! Alissa ! I can hear you . Alissa ! Are you all right ? I 'm okay ... I 'm alive . Hold on a second . I 'll get you out of there . Brother ! Don 't die ! Brother ! Brother ! Ivan . Good ... You came to ... I think I 'm a really lucky guy . Don 't speak yet . Allah will help me say what I need to . I guess you guys already figured it out but the Landmates you guys found in that ship were illegally sold by the military ... I thought so ! Who is pulling the strings ? Behind everything is the Cabinet Chief of Security in the Central Government General Kazama . ... and the leader of the Special Terrorism Countermeasure Forces Captain Shiberagi . right ? too ... Damn ! Why did you tell us now ? They 're still tying to kill you because of your information . I 've decided to bet on you guys . I can 't believe an international smuggler is saying things like that . You 're too laid back . True ... But I 've been like this for a while now . I can 't pretend to be something I 'm not anymore . You guys work hard for me ... You 're a good team . Brother . Take a rest . I 'm all right . I 'm a lucky guy . Brother ... I 'm sorry I gave you a lot of trouble . it 's no use complaining ... What were you guys doing ? We were just wondering why you waited so long before rescuing us ! What ? The cavalry is supposed to storm in at the last possible moment ! Alissa ! You shouldn 't be up ! I 'm all right . I 'm not that weak . Alissa ... Where are you going ? I have something I have to finish . Are you going to just march into Terrorism Countermeasure Headquarters ? Yes ... The Special Terrorism Countermeasure Force Headquarters ... Known as " Pandora . " it 's got to end somewhere . You can 't do it by yourself . it 'll be a hard job . everyone ... Are you kidding ? Do you know what kind of place that is ? These guys may just be a bunch of thugs but their base is a fortress with the newest security and combat systems . we are Angel Arms ! What do you mean ? N-N-No ! Don 't ... I can 't permit ... What an annoying prick . are the chances in our favor ? I 'm not planning to lose . Mr. Goman ... Can you permit this ? I commanded you to destroy the enemy ... Isn 't that correct ? Let 's go ! Pandora is a mobile fortress ... It has thirty-two stories above ground Level and seventy-one underground . Really ? It can move ? Yes . Almost hall the arms and ammunition Yokosuka base holds is stored there . Because of the risk inherent in housing such a stockpile there is a special escape route in case of emergency . What is it ? An undersea tunnel . A tunnel ? Yes . It was made for delivering supplies and passengers when we couldn 't go by sea . The tunnel was cracked ... and it 's out of use now . right ? That 's it . This tunnel is linked to the subway system . there is a problem . Problem ? Pandora has a specially designed defense system the door cannot be opened from the outside . That 's easy . We 'll just use a bazooka or a missile . When the sensors detect gunfire the tunnel collapses automatically . What the hell ! I can 't understand what the person who designed it was thinking . someone has to sneak into Pandora and open the door from inside . What ? That 's impossible ! I 'll go . Alissa ... it 's okay . I won 't make any mistakes . Elevator S5 's surveillance camera has ceased functioning . is the elevator moving ? Descending . Set up an ambush . Yes . Alissa . good bye . We got permission to blow the tunnel . Move ! Don 't bother me anymore ! Die ! I 've detected an explosion . Where is it ? 1942 ... We just passed there ! The tunnel may have been blown ! No way ! there is the exit ! Where is Alissa ? Alissa isn 't here yet . it 's here ! Alissa ! close it ! what were you doing ? Were you tying to get us killed ? What are you talking about ? even if we killed you . What ? it 's okay . Let 's go ! Right ! Damn ! where are you going ? They 're my customers . I have to welcome them . did you finish the repairs on Grayfox ? Yes . sir . That 's good enough ! Yes . Oh no . You made such a mess out of everything . sorry ... it 's Kei . We 've occupied the command room . That was quick . We 'll press forward . Roger . get into the computer . oui . you guard Michelle . now I 'm a babysitter ? I am not a baby ! come with me . Roger . Alissa ... You can do whatever you want . take care of yourself . I know . Let 's go ! Where are the monsters ? They 'll probably show up . they may be coming here . Do you know where the maintenance room is ? Just a second . Here it is . Thank you . Please enter password . baby . evacuate ! Level two accessed . next level ... Damn . too . Good job . Master . They 're putting on quite a show . Oh no ! I 'll take care of it . Michelle is just that good ! Please give me a good bonus ! you 're sneaky . now ! Level three accessed . Jean Luc ... Alissa ... I 'm glad . But I 'm not with you ... A little closer ... Come a little closer to me ... Yes . Come to where I am . Now ... Jean Luc ? Concentrate your senses . No ! Come on ... can you hear me ? The communication from Takako was cut off ! What did you say ? Alissa ? Why are you tense ? Are you afraid ? You shot me ... That 's because you advanced on me . you are still alive . you shot me . But you didn 't try to kill me . You diffused the plasma and let the power drop . Why ? You taught me to kill anyone ... even if he is family . But after all that why didn 't you kill me ? Because I need you . Takako ... Marcia ... Shoot at his arm while he is lighting with me . But if I hit you ... ammunition is stored all around us ! it 's impossible . Takako will die if I can 't hit him ! Marcia ! We don 't have time to think . You can do it ! You 're the only one who can save Takako ! But ... Announcement for all users ... immediately . complete Level lour immediately . Michelle ? the triggering device kicked in . The triggering device ? it 's going to sell-destruct ? watch out . Your arm only got clipped a little . But it hits your body you will die . Come light with me ! I 'll kill all of you together ! Don 't make fun of us ! Marcia ! Stay put ! please don 't move ! Yes ! Damn you ! W-What ? are you all right ? We 're okay . We exterminated one monster . how about you ? This base 's sell-destruct mechanism has been activated . How long do we have ? Ten minutes . Can you stop it ? I can 't ! Ten minutes isn 't enough time ! We have to help Alissa . calm down . Where is Alissa ? The top floor . Good . meet up there . We must help Alissa ! bad news . There is a warrant out for Captain Shiberagi 's arrest . What ? Actually ... too ... investigators are on their way here . Shiberagi failed ... What should I do ? Destroy all the evidence . Pandora 's secret information must be erased . Don 't leave anything that could effect my honor . right away . do you remember the smell of the town we grew up in ? Yes ... You smell the same . I lived according to your word . You were everything to me . Your eyes were like those of a stray dog who had lost a light . and your isolation made you feel that no one loved you . I could understand how the world looked to those eyes . That 's why I was with you . I thought that my and your loneliness could be filled up with each other . But I misunderstood ! A stray dog is always a stray dog . A stray dog is alone forever . I didn 't realize it . What are you saying ? What idiots have been influencing you ? Look ! This is the military 's top-secret information block . You always had better reaction time . I wouldn 't have been able to emerge from the other side of that defense wall . We two are one together . Let 's have fun like we did before . I don 't need my past . What ? I don 't want to live depending on the past like you . Don 't you still understand ? How can I see a future for us with this body ? My future was frozen in the darkness two years ago ! you 've always been like this ... You 're still a stray dog who can 't comprehend reality ! Shut up ! I 'll save your life if you say you 're sorry . say you 're sorry ! Alissa . Alissa ! We have to save her ! No ! Alissa won 't be able to come back . What should we do ? that 's the only way . Hurry up . Yes sir ! The protection was unlocked ... All the top military secrets ... This was your goal ... Yes . Who cares if Hassan dies or not ? Any county would make me rich for this kind of secret . Guess who 's been making a living as a cyber-brain spy ? Erase it . What happened ? Impossible ! This can 't happen ! help me ! Help me ! Alissa ! Please help me ! Alissa ! Alissa ! Are you okay ? Yes ... I saw a helicopter on the rooftop . We 'll use that to escape . Right ! Help me ... what are you doing ? Hurry up ! Help ... He can 't come back ! ... me ... Jean Luc ... Alissa ... Good bye ... General ! is that the helicopter you were talking about ? No way ! Now how can we escape ? Three minutes until detonation . Three minutes until detonation . Please evacuate immediately . you shrews ! The cavalry is here ! Get in ! Hurry up ! That 's good timing ! Mr. Endo ! is the girl who knocked me out twice still alive ? Everybody is alive . I won 't be satisfied until I slap her ass ! Isn 't that sexual harassment ? S-Sexual harassment ? Alissa ! Get closer ! All right ! I 'll take you guys with me ! You bastard ! Alissa ! Leave it to me ! take my hand ! All right ! Hurry up . Pandora is about to explode ! What ? We did it ! not too shabby ! What are you talking about ? Who do you think I am ? I need a favor . Alissa ? Can you make a new body for Kelvelos ? is this his nucleus ? That 's not like you at all . I want him to be one of our team . What ? huh ? Oh ? Beautiful sunrise ... Yes . A good morning ... too ! No jokes ! I 'm a police officer . I 'm a public employee ! I can 't be on a team with stray cats . Stray cats ? That 's mean . Yes it is . Who do you think saved your life ? Don 't worry about the details . All of us are one team ! Yeah !

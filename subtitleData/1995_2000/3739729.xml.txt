 ¡ Ven aquí ! ¿ Encontró algo importante ? - Deberíamos dejarlo en paz . - Vayamos al anciano , él sabrá qué hacer . Esto es malo , muy malo . Nos va a traer problemas para todos nosotros . Tenemos que decírselo al Dr Roosevelt . inmediatamente . - Dr Roosevelt ? - What is it ? We found something I think you should see . - lt 's an Amaru . - l know . It 's fantastic. lt 's nearly intact . - We can 't take it . - What do you mean ? They say the body of a female shaman is sacred to the tribe . They won 't allow us to disturb her . We are not disturbing her . We 're saving her . You know the situation here . I thought you could handle these people . Dr Roosevelt , I think this is dangerous . I don 't think this is right . Have the piece cleared and packed . It 's going with us . Mr Horning , are you still here ? What the hell ... ? How did you learn about what happened last night ? Tim Decker , a security guard , called me when he first discovered the blood . The police say you feel the murder may be an act of political terrorism . I think Horning was killed because of what he was working on . is that the " survey and excavation of the burial grounds of the Secona Indians " ? This is a letter sent to the State Department on behalf of the Secona , - demanding the return of an artifact . - The Amaru urn . - lt was among the antiquities we rescued . - Rescued ? When Petroecuador announced plans to build a pipeline through the burial grounds , - Carl Roosevelt and I organized the dig . - As I understand it , Roosevelt disappeared under circumstances not unlike the ones here . The Ecuadorian government claimed he was carried off in a wild animal attack . - But that 's not what you believe ? - Not after last night . - Have there ever been any death threats ? - No . Well , what about the curse ? The Secona believe that great evil would befall anyone moving the remains of an Amaru - a woman shaman . That they would be devoured by the jaguar spirit . A myth that gained currency among them - when Dr Roosevelt disappeared . - l 'm sure . The unfortunate thing is somebody exploiting it to promote fear , to pressure us into returning the bones - which I have no intention of doing . - Can we see it ? - Yes , of course . Mona . If someone digs me up in a thousand years , I hope there 's a curse on them too . They should have left it . None of this would have happened . - Do you believe the bones are cursed ? - Might as well be . Did you know Craig Horning ? Yeah. I 've been helping Craig catalog the Ecuadorian artifacts . I 'm a PhD candidate at BU . - Did he have any warning this could happen ? - Craig ? No . He was so dedicated . He was just doing the work that Dr Lewton asked him to . He had no political feelings about it being here ? - No , not Craig . - Are you aware that a letter of protest was sent to the State Department concerning this urn ? I 'm aware of several letters of protest . This one was written by a man named Alonso Bilac . Dr Bilac . He was the liaison with the Secona Indians . - ls he still with the project ? - No . He either resigned or was forced out by Dr Lewton , depending on who you talk to . Why 's that ? Dr Bilac feels the Secona have the right to determine the fate of their ancestors . Do you know where we might find him ? - Dr Bilac ? - Yes . We 're with the fbi . We 're investigating the disappearance of an associate of yours , Craig Horning . Yes . May we ask you some questions ? Come in , then . You were part of the expedition that brought back the Amaru urn . - Who told you that ? - Mona Wustner . I objected from the beginning . But you were Dr Roosevelt 's liaison in Ecuador . At what point did you part company with him on the taking of artifacts ? When I felt like he had gone too far . Against the wishes of the Secona . Did you express that to him ? Yes . He wouldn 't listen . Were you speaking for yourself or for the Indians ? I spent the last six months living with the Secona , learning from them , coming to understand the nature and the depth of their culture . Well , apparently they 've learned something from you too . Yes. I 've been teaching them the joys of American bureaucracy . Dr Lewton believes that the protest over the Amaru urn has something to do with Craig Horning 's disappearance . You say " disappearance " as if you expect to see him alive again . - What do you think happened to him ? - You don 't want to know what I think . Yes . We would like to know . We 'd be very interested in what you think . I think whatever happened to Craig Horning will continue to happen . Until the bones are returned to their rightful place . Let me ask you , Dr Bilac : How far would you go to defend the rights of the Seconas ? Farther than writing a letter to the State Department ? If you think I did this , then you 're a fool . - Where were you last night ? - l was here . - Alone ? - Yes . Your investigation is a waste of time . That 's something I can assure you of . It 's nice to meet people who really believe in something . You mean the kind who would kill for their cause ? - Do you think Bilac 's a suspect ? - No , I think he 's the suspect . - Based on what ? - Based on the arrogance of his politics , his rift with Dr Lewton , his sympathy for the Indians and the lack of any other suspects . - He did look a little squirrely back there . - Maybe he was up late , murdering Horning . Remember , we don 't have a body and not much more forensic detail than a lot of blood . Craig Horning 's blood . What do you think he did with him ? - l 'm not sure he did anything . - You think Bilac 's innocent ? That the victim wasn 't murdered , but devoured by a mythological jaguar spirit ? Go with it , Scully . Why did you lie to them ? You 're drawing suspicion to yourself , Lonnie . You should have told them the truth . I 'm worried about you . Let me come over . Why ? Why not ? Dr Lewton 's here. I gotta go. I 'll call you later . - l thought you 'd already left . - l really need to keep working right now . - l 'd feel better if you weren 't alone here . - The guard knows I 'm here . Was that Dr Bilac on the phone ? Yes . We have a responsibility , Mona . To history and posterity . Dr Roosevelt did as any good conservationist would have done in bringing the urn back . Otherwise it would certainly have been destroyed . I know . Before you get caught up in the politics ... We lose sight of that . Mona , let me give you a little free advice . You have a bright future here . Be careful where you plant your flag . Sugar . - Label that . - As what ? " Partial rat body part . " Excuse me . Can I have a word with you ? We 're done here . You were working here when Dr Lewton was killed . He stopped by my office on his way out . Did you notice anything out of the ordinary ? Was he behaving strange ? - Did he seem nervous about anything ? - No , not at all . Did he say anything to you about Dr Bilac ? No , he didn 't . Do you have any idea when the two of them last spoke to each other ? I really don 't know . I 'm gonna give you my card . Call me if anything comes to mind . Mulder . - They turn up a body ? - No . They 've been over the entire museum grounds . Have you found anything out here ? If Dr Lewton was brought through here , it 'll be hard to determine. lt rained hard last night . They determined the hood release had been pulled , and they found a flashlight by the car . I 'd say he was checking the engine when he was attacked . - Maybe someone didn 't want the car started . - l don 't think so , Mulder . We found two mutilated rat bodies down in the engine compartment . - Rats ? - The museum has always had a rat problem . They must have crawled into the engine to keep warm . You know , Mulder , there 's hardly a thing about these deaths that adds up . What 's the estimate on the time of death ? Between 9 : 30 and midnight , when the guard discovered the blood . It 's about the same time as Craig Horning . - What 's the connection ? - l don 't know . - l think Mona Wustner knows something . - Why ? She seemed to get nervous when I asked her about Bilac . Maybe she 's protecting him . I think it 's startin ' to rain again . I don 't think so , Mulder . What the hell is that ? Lonnie ? Don 't . I came to tell you ... Dr Lewton is dead . Did you hear what I said ? - Say something , please . You 're scaring me . - l told you not to come here . Why not ? What 's happened to you ? Ever since you came back , you 're acting like some stranger . - Like someone else . - The blood has to stop . You know something , don 't you ? You wouldn 't understand . Then help me to understand . You can tell me . You know that , don 't you ? What is that ? Vine of the soul . Yaje ? You 're drinking yaje ? You 're sick , Lonnie . You need help . Don 't you see what 's happening here ? Can 't you see what you 're doing to yourself ? Go . - Let me help you . - l said get out ! Well , it 's human . Small intestine . There 's four feet ofjejunum and another foot of ileum . - Do we know it 's Lewton ? - Yeah . By what he had for lunch . Corn chowder . And it looks like he 'd been snacking on sunflower seeds all afternoon . - A man of taste . - l can 't tell how the body was eviscerated . There are no knife marks on the epithelium . I imagine that they were torn or pulled from the body cavity . - " Torn or pulled " ? - But I can 't tell that either . There was considerable postmortem predation . - By what ? - Well , by the size of the bite marks ... A small animal . Most probably a rat . - More rats . - Yep . Scully . Slow down , Mona . I was with Dr Bilac . He frightened me . I thought he was gonna hurt me . - What happened , Mona ? - He 's sick . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . - Where is he now ? - At his house . I left him there and I came back to the museum , but ... I feel like someone 's here . Like someone 's watching me . I want you to stay where you are. I 'll send Agent Mulder over to get you right away , OK ? OK . What is it , Sugar ? Dr Bilac ? - What are you doing here ? - Looking for Mona . - l got a panic call from her . Where is she ? - l 'll show you . - Mulder . - Mulder , it 's me . Did you find Mona ? No , but her car is parked outside . She 's not here . Did you find Bilac ? No . He 's not here either . But I found some journals . Listen to this . " l 've seen the Amaru . " " Coming out of the jungle with the eyes of a scorpion , the claws of ajaguar . " " She leaps down from the trees . " " She tears at my flesh , then holds my head in her hands and eats out my eyes . " - ls there a date of entry on that ? - These are all recent . Read me the part about the jaguar in the trees again . - Why ? - That may be how the intestines got up there . Mulder , I think Bilac 's been tripping. I found something strange in a ceremonial bowl . And from his writings , it says that it 's a hallucinogen called yaje . " The vine of the soul . " What the hell 's that mean ? He 's been praying to the Amaru through some kind of a ceremony . - What does he want from her ? - lt looks like he 's invoking the curse , Mulder . Scully , I 'm gonna have to call you back . - Did you find Mona ? - l hope not . What are you doing here ? I said , what are you doing here ? She 's dead . Where is she ? I don 't know . You told Agent Mulder that she was dead . You must know where she is . I didn 't kill her . Then why do you have blood on your clothes ? I told you. I came here because the Amaru would not be appeased . I was afraid for Mona . I tried to keep her away from all this . She was an innocent . She said she was scared . She said that you became violent . She wouldn 't listen . Maybe you were too high to know the difference . There is no curse , is there , Dr Bilac ? - You are the curse . - No . This is more powerful than any man . This is a spirit you 're dealing with , the spirit of the Amaru . This is not something you can put in handcuffs . I 'm gonna ask you one more time , Dr Bilac . Where is Mona 's body ? I don 't know . That man stays in that room until there 's a full search of the museum . Yes , ma 'am . Hey , Scully . Come here for a second . Itjust dawned on me . Why do you think there 's so much water in here ? Well , I just assumed that one of the toilets had overflowed . There 's water on every seat . It 's more like every toilet overflowed . Now , why would that happen ? I guess there 's only one way to find out . I hate this . Rats . In every toilet . - How did they get in ? - Agent Mulder . The police found something outside . - Mona Wustner ? - No . Sugar , her dog . He 's dead . Finally , a body . What did you find ? I have to run a full toxicological to be sure , but it looks like warfarin poisoning . - Warfarin ? - Rat poison . - Someone fed this dog rat poison ? - No . When I dissected the dog 's stomach , I found an undigested fragment of feline intestine . The dog ate a cat . I also found what appears to be bits of rat fur . I think the rat ate the poison . - The cat ate a rat . - The dog ate the cat . - More rats , Scully . - Yeah ? - Don 't you think that 's significant ? - Significant of what ? There were rats in the car engine , in the bathroom where it looks like Mona was killed , and now here . It 's an old building . They have a rat problem . A lot of old buildings do . It 's more than that . What do the Secona believe ? The jaguar will devour anybody that desecrates the burial place of a holy woman . It 's transmigration of the soul into animal form , through a ceremony where they drink ... - Yaje . - Yeah . To summon the spirits . So what are we talking ? A possessed rat ? The return of Ben ? No , I think those rats were trying to escape from something . That sent them diving into the toilet ? No , the lids were down . They were trying to get out . They were in the sewers , trying to get away from something . - Have you been drinking yaje , Mulder ? - Go with it , Scully . Agent Scully ? Bilac 's gone . - How is that possible ? - l don 't know . I went to check on him and he just ... wasn 't there . - Did you leave this door at any time ? - No . - No one entered ? - Absolutely not . - What about a rat ? - Sir ? - You ever see any rats in this room ? - All the time . Why ? - How do they get in ? - Through the heating system . There are vents all over the place . - Are there any other exits ? - There 's only one way out . - You didn 't hear anything ? - Nothing . I want you to search the entire building , beginning with every room on this floor . Hey , Scully , take a look at this . - Where does that lead ? - The old steam tunnels . - How do you get down ? - They 're sealed up . Haven 't been used for 50 years . You think Bilac crawled down there ? Unless he was dragged . The system looks like it branches off into three directions . - There must be miles of tunneling . - And only one way in . And one way out . Ladies first ? Which way ? To the left , it looks like . Follow that rat . We should be directly under the museum here . Scully . What is it ? Oh , my God . It 's Dr Lewton . Looks like his eyes were eaten right out of his sockets . We still don 't know by what . - What is it ? - l think it 's a cat . Do you think that cat killed these people ? No , these cats . Do you know which way is out ? Come on , Scully . No , no . This way . There 's a room here with a vent . Here . It 's Bilac . - Can you reach up in there ? - Yeah . Let 's move him down here . OK , I will call you back later . The search team 's on their way up . They have all the bodies , including Mona 's and Bilac 's . - What about the cats ? - Animal Control is still looking . - So far they haven 't found any sign of them . - We both saw them . We know they 're there . No one 's denying that . It 's just that there are miles of tunnels . It 's gonna take weeks to search them all . - By then it won 't matter . - What are you talking about ? The assistant secretary of state 's office has called in the Ecuadorian ambassador . - What for ? - Five people had to die , but they 're finally taking it seriously . - The curse ? - No . Bilac 's letter of protest . The State Department wants the museum to stay closed until they can act officially . - Are they gonna send back the bones ? - The urn will be back by the end of the week . The Suffolk County coroner ruled the museum deaths were animal attacks . What motivated these attacks and why no more have occurred has not been explained . To the museum , the Amaru urn was an artifact from a dying culture , its curse merely a primitive superstition . Dr Bilac learned there is a world beyond our own : unseen but powerful , and as real as the urn itself . The icons from that world represent forces that cannot be tamed or collected in a museum . The curse that struck the museum was the failure to understand that there are powers that should not be disturbed . That some things are better left buried .

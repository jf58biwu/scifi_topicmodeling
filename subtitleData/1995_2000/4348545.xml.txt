 Do a lot of research for the Army , doc ? Only when something odd turns up . I 've got a contract to survey the old tracks and tunnel out here for anything strange . Well , this is where we 've had the magnetic anomalies . - The old Powder Wash train station . - Oh , man . What a dump . You got it . - I 'll unload the truck , sarge . - Okay . Not much to look at . My orders are for you to bunk inside while you survey the tunnel . Okay , how do you wanna handle this ? First we 'll set up your gear in the station then we 'll survey the tunnel . Okay , because I can 't calibrate my equipment until you tell me how much that tunnel has shifted . So if you want to go on ahead I 'll set up my equipment by myself . - Okay , holler if you need a hand . - All right . Soldier , got the maps ready ? Ready to go , sergeant . What the ? A train ? Sergeant Mapes ? Hello ? David ? David ? You 've got to throw the switch . - Can 't you hear me ? - What 's wrong ? What 's the matter ? Hey , you . Wait . Wait a minute . For God 's sakes , throw the switch . What the hell is going on ? Hey , you , where 'd you go ? Hello ? Secure sector seven now . - Sergeant Mapes ? - Hey , doc , what do you need ? Get off the tracks ! Oh , no . Who cut the power cable ? - Did you see the light ? - What light ? Go use the radio in the truck , I 'll stay with him . The bell went off in the station , then the guy ran into the tunnel , hurt . - He had to have passed you . - Nobody was here but us . - There was a danger light , sergeant . - Not a chance . Get to the truck and radio for a chopper . Move , man ! Since the beginning oh time mankind has existed between the world oh light and the world oh darkness . Our secret society has been here horever protecting others hrom the creatures who inhabit the shadows and the night . Known only to the initiated by our true name The Legacy . Prager , get off the tracks ! For God 's sakes , throw the switch ! The University of MÃ©rida is faxing a translation of the Mayan beating-heart ritual . The Mexico City House will take it from here . - Anything else ? - The U.S. Army 's doing some interesting work in Colorado . - What 's interesting about it ? - Dr. David Prager . Prager ? So the two of you finally managed to bury the hatchet ? Not likely . We 'll never ever be able to iron out our differences but I can 't help keeping an eye on his work . If the poor man only knew that you were watching him like watching a barometer , waiting for a storm . He 's a consultant for what 's called the Powder Wash Project . What is it , an incinerator ? Yeah , it 's very high-tech . It 's used for burning chemical weapons from the Cold War . I read about it . Prager 's a psychic debunker . What 's he doing messing around with nerve gas ? I don 't know . But the point is , I 've been having dreams about him . It 's vague , just a sensation of jeopardy . I 've had plenty of arguments with this man but I 've never dreamed about him . - So you ran a search ? - Yes . And his name finally came up in an obscure article on defense research . I couldn 't get any details , though . Only where he 's working . I still don 't understand why the Army would pull in Prager unless it was to kill some kind of a rumor about a sighting . The man is virtually impossible to convince about supernatural phenomena . I mean , he 's based his entire career on it . Well , whatever he 's doing it 's bound to have some supernatural connection . I 've got a gut feeling about this , Derek , that 's very unsettling and I think we should check it out , and soon . Powder Wash opens for business in three days . Okay , I admit , it 's only a hunch , but ... No , no , no . Trust your instincts . If this project is somehow haunted what could be worse than an accident with nerve gas ? You should go to Powder Wash , Alex . Hello ? Anyone there ? David ? Prager ? David ? Prager . David . Sorry , I just wanted to say hello . - It 's me . Alex . - Yeah , Alex . Last time we saw each other was in New Orleans , right ? - That psi study group at Loyola . - Right . - Yeah . - I left there in ' 92 . I live in San Francisco now . What are you doing in Colorado in the sticks ? I read somewhere you were doing work for the Army , and I got curious . About my work ? You used to be thoroughly underwhelmed by my work . - What 's changed all of a sudden ? - I never criticized your work , David . Only your refusal to possibly see another point of view . To see it isn 't to prove it , a distinction you generally ignored . You need a hypothesis , experiments , empirical evidence , Alex . - You can 't prove everything , David . - Empirical evidence . Okay , I 'm sorry . Let 's just not rehash all this , okay ? Tell me about Powder Wash . What are you doing here ? I 'm redecorating . Can 't you tell ? Powder Wash Station . Built 1891 , abandoned three years later . I 'm surprised the old place hasn 't fallen down . We 're the first people working here since before the age of flight . It 's taken two weeks for me to complete my redecorating . You should have seen it . - So , what are you studying exactly ? - Straight physics . At the moment , I 'm measuring magnetic fields . The Army has me looking for oddities and ... What 's it all about ? They 've ... Well , we 've had some problems . For one thing , the magnetism fluctuates wildly around here . I haven 't pinned down the cause . Not yet . But I send the Army my reports and they think it 's safe enough to go ahead . But you don 't buy that , I gather . You 're still testing . Let 's just say I never give up on a puzzle . That 's what makes perfectly reasonable people become physicists . God . It 's not your usual work . I mean , this is pretty far afield from psychic debunking . Some smart-ass labeled me : " The man who measures the unmeasurable . " But when you 're looking for elusive energies it all comes down to physics . I don 't suppose you heard this bell ? The bell ? No . - What do you see ? - The tracks , the tunnel . What am I supposed to see ? A man has been walking out of that tunnel and waving at me . You said a man . Do you know who he is ? A railroad employee . A signalman , maybe . He 's hurt . His face is bloody . He walks out of the tunnel , and he waves at me . He shouts , " Throw the switch . " He puts his arm over his face , and he backs into the tunnel . He 's done it three times exactly the same way . He never explains himself , and I can 't find him . I don 't see anything , David . It 's not something I can explain . Not yet . But you 're hearing things . Seeing this man . I believe they 're real for you , proof or no proof . Alex called . Prager seems to be seeing an injured man appear and disappear repeatedly . Now take a look at this . From 100 A.D. " The Chronicles of Saint Evaristus . " What 's the connection to Prager ? When the Holy City burned , Evaristus was trapped in his cell . The Rome House coined the term " crisis apparition " a dying specter which gives vague warnings to one person . Or Prager may simply be delusional . Alex had clairvoyant dreams about Prager 's ghost . - It gives the situation some credence . - She dreamed about him ? I don 't know , Derek . You know how empathetic she is . She may have a big personal conflict here . We have to take a chance . A crisis apparition foretells a catastrophe , Rachel . The Holy City fire killed 7000 people . But Powder Wash is just 100 miles away from Denver . If a cloud of gas gets loose it could easily kill 7 million . Here 's a sketch of the signalman . It 'll give you a general idea , but I left the blood off his face . And he always says : " David , throw the switch . Can 't you hear me ? " Yeah . Don 't ask me what it means . I have no idea . David , if this is so hard for you , why do you stay ? You know , I 've spent my whole career proving phantoms don 't exist . Now I 've got one I can 't disprove . - You want some ? - No . Look at me , drinking like a fish . A little white wine usually suits me , and then only at faculty parties . Do you hear it now ? I left this unit exactly how I found it . And measured it for a fraction of a decibel . Nothing . And no electrical current to the telegraph key . Because the rats made a meal of the power cables over a hundred years ago . Now the light 's flashing . But that 's impossible . David , can you hear me ? They 're coming , David . You have to make it right . It 's him . Don 't you hear him ? David , what do you see ? What 's there ? - There he is . - Kill him . - He 's the one . - Shoot him . No . No . David . - Hey , you look better . - Hi . I had a shower . Doctors gave me something to help me sleep , finally . - They go over these with you ? - No physical damage . Not a mark on me . But it sure felt like I had been shot . I 've never felt anything so agonizing in my whole life . I believe you . And what matters here is that the manifestations you sense are real for you . Too real . - I must be losing it . - Are you ? I told you , I saw soldiers in old uniforms . Turn of the century , the same era as the signalman . This adds a whole new element . We 're not dealing with just one entity . I wonder why they closed the tunnel in 1894 . What made these spirits so agitated ? Forget 1894 . I need to know if anything 's gonna happen now . I know , and these hauntings are the key . Derek left for Colorado an hour ago . He 's worried about Alex . I 've mapped out all the information that we have on Powder Wash but it isn 't much . It 's no coincidence they hid it in Colorado 's empty corner . The question is , why did they hide it ? Well , if you 're gonna burn nerve gas , you 're not gonna do it in Manhattan . Got that right . The old rockets and bombs will travel by train through the tunnel where Prager 's working to the incinerator . The Army even opened up an old Northern Union track . It closed in 1894 . First train is scheduled in two days . These are what the Army calls " events , " mostly small accidents . So , what is this electrical symbol near the mouth of the tunnel ? Well , that 's where that man almost bought it the one that Prager helped save . Because the first ghost warned him . But last night , when more of them appeared they tried to kill Prager . And Derek 's counting on us to find out who they are and what they want . We 're not gonna do it this way . The Army 's information is classified . - Isn 't it always ? - No kidding . Even their report on why the tunnel was closed was made top-secret over 100 years ago . Is there any way you can get it ? Maybe through the Freedom of Information Act . But it 's gonna take a while and that train starts running in two days . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hi , Alex . Jeez , Derek . What the hell are you doing here ? How 's Prager ? He 's sleeping at the clinic . You don 't think I can handle this . I believe there are supernatural forces at work here . Come on , Alex , let me support what you 're trying to do . Oh , look at this . Prager said he found it under the station when he was cleaning up . Looks genuine . Did you taste it ? Are you kidding ? He was drinking some last night , but he wasn 't drunk . Whatever 's going on isn 't so easy to explain . Well , " Whenever you eliminate the impossible whatever remains , however improbable must be the truth . " Is that one of your golden rules ? No , not me , Sherlock Holmes . Prager 's ghost shot him in this direction , right ? Yeah . Pretty close , why ? A hunch . Look at this . A bullet . If shots were fired from the gun last night that 's exactly where it would have hit the wall . No . No , this is not from last night . Look . The lead is all tarnished . This is from the days when the station was open . - Can I see that ? - Here . Can you hear me ? For God 's sakes , throw the switch ! - Alex ! - Can you hear me ? What did you see ? What did you see ? I saw him . I saw the signalman . - For God 's sakes ... - He was here . The bullet . It shocked me . I heard a bell , and I saw light . I tasted whiskey . For some reason , whiskey 's part of what he 's trying to warn us about . They noticed his room was empty an hour ago . Now , where would he go ? - I tasted whiskey . - You could have smelled whiskey . - The bottle was there . - No , I didn 't smell it , I tasted it . I know where he is . Hey , Prager . You 've been spending too much time out there by yourself . Looking a little rank . You might want to ease up a little . How about I buy you a cup of coffee ? Are you listening to me ? David , throw the switch . Are you listening to me ? Doc . - David , what are you doing ? - Don 't do it , doc . - What are you doing ? - Get him out of here . I 'm filing this with HQ , doctor . They 'll wonder why you 're still out there when they paid you off . Who 's your friend ? My name is Derek Rayne . Alex and I work together . Listen , let us take you back . I mean , you 're in no condition to go anywhere . Besides , all your gear is back at the station . That 's not all . I know what was there . I saw him . He 's real , and so are the others . You 're the one getting the warnings . Don 't you wanna know why ? I can live without it . I doubt that , Dr. Prager . You cannot simply walk away . You need to know , and so do we . David ? What 's wrong ? Prager ? Prager . Prager ? David ? You 've got to throw the switch , damn it . No , you 've had enough of that . We should test this . Frontier whiskey was infamous for lead content . Lead poisoning doesn 't happen overnight . It takes years . Everything Alex has been through bears out what Prager says . - How 's she doing ? - Well , Alex seems in control and he 's beginning to confide in her . I need you two to hollow up hrom there . I need any inhormation you can find out about this place . All right . You got it , Derek . We 'll get right back to you . Look , let 's approach this scientifically . Usually there 's a pattern . Are there any family stories about ghosts or hauntings ? Not that I know of . My mother died when I was 2 , so I don 't know much about her side . And on my father 's side , I can only trace it as far back as my great-grandfather Douglas Prager . He 's buried in Denver . What about your two uncles and three aunts ? I did my research . Very scientific , but nothing supernatural . Until you . You were drawn here . Compelled . Somehow , you feel responsible . Maybe . It 's almost like I came here for some special reason . How do you feel about free will versus destiny ? Destiny . I don 't know . I 've seen a lot of things that would be hard to explain any other way but it 's difficult to accept we don 't have free will . Oh , I think we have free will but now I realize I 've made a lot of decisions that led me right here . I mean , I could have gone to MIT instead of Cal Poly . The floor 's loose back here . Look at this , an old pocket watch . Okay , folks , the 8 : 00 train from Wyman is due in . Please take all your luggage and bags out on the platform . That 's the 8 : 00 train from Wyman . All aboard . David ? You folks have a good day . That 's right , just take your bags and head out on the platform . Have a wonderful trip . A secret drawer ? Folks , get back in the station . Folks get back in the station ! Folks . Mr. Prager . David . Let me help you . No ! - Stay with him , I 'll get a light . - David ! - David . - They 're trapped . They need help . David . Oh , my God , they 're all dead . Stop it , David . Stop it . Oh , my God . Where did he go ? The Army has search parties looking for Prager . Do you think we should we tell them about this journal ? David found it just before he ran out of the station . It 's his great-grandfather 's . No , they 're not in the mood for ghost stories . The remains have been removed , the tunnel is being prepared . They plan to run the trains on schedule . First one in the morning . Well , I think they should know what 's in here . Take a look at this . Stationmaster Douglas Prager . It 's David 's great-grandfather . He was here , that was his station . This is his journal . Look . " May 10 , 1894 . Telegraphed those idiots in Denver . Told them we 'd lose one from Wyman sure as hell . They say that 's what I 'm there for . " " July 6 . Four nights now . Can 't sleep . Drank till dawn hoping the whiskey would blot out the sound of how it will be . A hundred tons driven into that tunnel like a steel cork slammed into a bottle . " He tried to warn them , but he failed . He was worried about a crash . " Lose one from Wyman . " Prager mentioned Wyman today . I bet you that 's where we 'll find him . Yeah , this is a fax that Nick sent . He got the Army 's classified report on the Powder Wash catastrophe in 1894 . A troop train lost its brakes and crashed in the tunnel , July 7 , 1894 , at 8 a.m. Forty-two men were lost . The Army covered it up , claimed the crash never happened . But we found them . We gave them their last rites . They should be at rest . But they aren 't the only ghosts at work . The spirit of Douglas Prager has also returned . And it 's warning us for a new crisis . - So it could happen again ? - Yeah . With a train full of nerve gas . This is the tomb of the soldiers at the bend halfway through the tunnel . The accidents start here but as time passes , they spread outward . Toward the mouth of the tunnel . They 've been reaching out from the grave for a century . An unconsecrated grave , forgotten , in unhallowed ground . God , Nick , how much vengeance does it take to repay a hundred years of torment ? Wyman is 11 miles from Powder Wash . This is where Prager might be headed . This has gotta be Wyman , Derek . We 've gotta be close . Well , maybe we just weren 't meant to find him . This seems to be David 's destiny . " I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act . But I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act . " - More Sherlock Holmes ? - No , my father quoting G.K. Chesterton . It 's how he taught me about The Legacy 's destiny . There he is . - David . - What 's wrong ? David , where have you been ? Just walking . This ... This looks fairly flat but it 's actually a 6 percent downhill grade toward the tunnel . I worked out the math . Six percent doubles the train 's momentum every half-mile . Okay , well , let 's explain it to the Army , okay ? A lot they know . They feel sure that their trains can make the bend in the tunnel . Not like the old days . Those old steam engines , their brakes used to overheat . New trains don 't even feel it . So it 's not a problem , then . Look , you 've lost a lot of blood . I think you should go back . There 's no time . - Time for what ? What 's the problem ? - The bend in the tunnel . It 's no coincidence that 's where I found the corpses . - But you said the train can make it . - Lf the brakes work . But those soldiers ' corpses their souls , they want to pay them back . I found a letter at the station . It 's a bank draft from the railroad to his widow my great-grandmother . Her hardship allowance . Her hardship allowance because he was killed on a job . Douglas was shot , just like you relived it . The survivors hunted him down and killed him on the tracks . Can 't you hear that , Alex ? Listen . Hear it now ? Let her go , or I 'll bring you back . Don 't be ridiculous . We 're out of time . Listen . - Let her go . - You 're not trying . - You 're not trying ! - I don 't hear anything , David . The spirits in that tunnel are gonna destroy the train . The nerve-gas shipment is on its way . We 've gotta stop the train . Sergeant Mapes . Stop right there . This is off-limits . Hold it there . You found him . How bad is he ? You 've gotta stop the train before it hits the tunnel . The chance of an accident is just too great to risk . I wouldn 't worry about it . Man your posts . Double the guards ... Take him out of here and clear the area . That 's an order . We just cleared Wyman . We 're on the downhill grade . ETA , five minutes . Conditions normal . Speed within limits . Delta Company reporting . Train is clear . I 'm serious , you can 't come in here . Yes , sir . This is Sergeant Mapes . All secure . Yes , sir , we 're set . Call them back and stop the train . That was a full-bird colonel , lady . Colonels start trains , sergeants don 't stop them . It 's going through that tunnel at 8 , on time . Hey , we 're picking up speed . - Check the speedometer . - I 'm checking it . Hold on . My brakes are failing . This guy is never gonna to listen to us , Derek . Well , he can convince his officer that he caught two terrorists . How do you know we aren 't planning some act of sabotage , sergeant ? Emergency . I 've got a bad situation here . Speed building . Revise ETA , four minutes . Slow us down . Do something , man . I can 't ! Do you hear that ? That 's what Prager 's been hearing . You 've been through signalman 's basics . You can read code . Runaway ? What runaway ? It 's not even connected . - What have you rigged up here ? - Nothing . If you 've jigged the tracks or planted a bomb ... Not a bomb . Not us . The dead soldiers who have been left in that tunnel for over a century it 's their revenge . History is about to repeat itself . How can that be ? That 's crazy . Oh , you want to take a chance ? If that train slams into the mountain then those old nerve-gas bombs will blow apart . There will be a lethal cloud over the whole state . Stop the train now . It 's up to you , sergeant . You , halt . Prager . I won 't warn you twice . Keep off the tracks . David , you 've done all you can do . David ... David , that thing hasn 't moved since they boarded up the station . This was his job , switch a runaway train away from the tunnel so that it would miss it because the Army overloaded it . But the siding is gone . It doesn 't exist . - The Army 's gonna stop their train . - They can 't do it . It 's up to me . No one is going to interfere with that train . Leave him alone , sergeant . Whiskey . My God , I taste whiskey . The stupid bastard was drunk . How could he ? For God 's sakes , pull the switch . Can 't you hear me ? You 've got to throw the switch , David . - It 's gone . What should I do ? - Can you hear me ? Get off the tracks , David . Please . You 've got to throw the switch , David . - You 'll get killed . - Hit the warning light . Get off the track ! Alex , I gotta stop this train for all those soldiers he killed , so they can rest in peace . Please , please , let me do it . Alex , get away from him . Prepare to fire . Prager , get off the tracks . - Shoot him . - No . Shoot him ! Leave him alone . No . My brakes wouldn 't hold . I 've never seen anything like this before . - Check under the train . - It was like a big hand pulling the train . There 's a bend that would have killed us all . Where 's David Prager ? I saw the poor SOB go under the wheels . Where 's his body ? You saw someone named Prager , sergeant but I don 't think it was David . Alex , I 'm sorry . Like he said , he was born to do so . It was his fate , Alex . But we brought him back here to die . It was our fate . Because of David Prager , 50 men are finally at peace and a million are spared . And if it was our fate to help him we have no choice than to accept it .

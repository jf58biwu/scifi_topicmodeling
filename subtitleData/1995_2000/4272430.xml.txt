[ Blevins ] I 'M SOMEWHAT AT A LOSS HERE IN GOING FORWARD . THIS SITUATION DEVELOPING UNEXPECTEDLY ... DURING A FORMAL INQUIRY INTO YOUR REPORTED DEATH , AGENT MULDER . THE FACT OF YOUR BEING HERE TODAY VERY MUCH ALIVE , IT GIVES THE EFFECT OF RESHAPING THIS INVESTIGATION ... INTO SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT , AS WE 'RE NOW PUT UPON TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY ... OF THIS BODY FOUND IN YOUR APARTMENT ... AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED TO THIS . WOULD YOU CARE TO ENLIGHTEN US ON THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ? ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I CAN ?

YOU SHOULD 'VE MENTIONED THAT AT THE HOSPITAL , HAULING MY ASS OFF . I SAVED YOUR ASS , AGENT MULDER . I 'VE BEEN WITHHOLDING FORENSIC EVIDENCE ABOUT THE BODY FOUND ON YOUR APARTMENT FLOOR . UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP LAST NIGHT , I WAS THE ONE KEEPING YOUR SECRET . I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO BRING YOU IN . SCULLY WILL VERIFY ALL OF THAT . THAT 'S A GOOD PLACE TO LAY IT , CONSIDERING HER CONDITION . YOU WANT ME TO LAY IT WHERE IT BELONGS , AGENT MULDER ? PATHOLOGY TURNED UP TWO GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO THE DEAD MAN IN YOUR APARTMENT- - ONE FIRED POINT-BLANK TO THE LEFT TEMPLE WITH A HANDGUN , THE SECOND A POSTMORTEM WOUND TO THE FACE TO REMOVE THE MAN 'S IDENTITY . NOW , I 'D BE HAPPY TO VERIFY THE BALLISTICS ON THAT FIRST SHOT . HOW CAN YOU HELP ME ? TELL ME WHY SCULLY LIED FOR YOU . THE DISEASE SHE HAS WAS GIVEN TO HER ... BY SOMEBODY CONNECTED TO THE F.B.I.

[ Man On TV ] THE CHAIRMAN SAID , " WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE LIMITS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE ? " I DON 'T THINK THERE ARE ANY APPROPRIATE LIMITS TO HUMAN KNOWLEDGE .

THE CLONING OF HUMANS WOULD BE ILL-CONSIDERED ... AND TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH . CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU SEE ... AS THE BIGGEST TECHNICAL OBSTACLE TO HUMAN CLONING- - [ Continues , Indistinct ] I TRUST YOU 'VE HEARD . MULDER IS ALIVE . AS I SAID , HE 'S NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED . YES , AS YOU SAID . THOUGH I HEAR HE HAS YOU TO THANK IN SOME PART FOR HIS NEW FREEDOM . USING A STOLEN I.D. , MULDER WAS ABLE TO GET INSIDE THE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS FACILITY . AND YOU ALLOWED HIM TO ESCAPE . YES . WE 'RE TOO VULNERABLE . OUR MAN IN THE F.B.I. IS EXPOSED . WHAT MULDER MAY HAVE SEEN COULD EXPOSE OUR PLANS . WHAT MULDER 'S SEEN ONLY SERVES US . IT SERVES TO ENSURE OUR PLANS . MULDER 'S IN TROUBLE . HE NEEDS HELP . WE CAN GIVE IT TO HIM . IN EXCHANGE FOR ? HIS NEW LOYALTY ... TO US . AS I 'VE SAID ALL ALONG , MULDER 'S MUCH MORE VALUABLE TO US ALIVE . YOU CAN PROCEED NOW . MULDER , WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? HEARD YOU WERE BEING MOVED OUT OF I.C.U. , YOU WERE FEELING BETTER . MULDER , SOMEBODY 'S GONNA SEE YOU HERE . IT 'S OKAY . I 'M OFFICIALLY AMONG THE UNDEAD . WHAT HAPPENED ? I DIDN 'T COME HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT . MULDER , DON 'T TRY AND PROTECT ME . I NEED TO KNOW . WELL , THERE 'S NOT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT ANYWAY . I 'M GONNA TESTIFY TO EVERYTHING I KNOW IN FRONT OF THE F.B.I. ASSEMBLY . THE CONSPIRACY , THE MEN BEHIND IT , WHAT I BELIEVE IS ITS PURPOSE . DID YOU FIND OUT WHO IN THE F.B.I. IS INVOLVED ? NO . BUT THAT DOESN 'T MATTER NOW . YES , IT DOES . HEY , SCULLY , HOW ABOUT THOSE YANKEES , HUH ? MULDER , SKINNER HAS EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU . HE KNOWS THAT YOU KILLED THAT MAN THEY FOUND IN YOUR APARTMENT . YEAH . SKINNER 'S WITHHOLDING IT . MULDER , SKINNER 'S DIRTY . HE 'S NOT YOUR FRIEND . I 'M ALMOST CERTAIN THAT HE 'S THE MAN INSIDE ON THIS . I DON 'T BELIEVE THAT . IF YOU TESTIFY , HE WILL USE IT TO RUIN YOU . NO , NOT SKINNER . HE 'S-HE 'S BEEN IN A POSITION TO KNOW EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINNING , EVERYTHING THAT WE 'VE DONE OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS . IF I DON 'T TESTIFY NOW , THEY 'LL START TO BURY THE TRUTH . WELL , THEN YOU HAVE TO LAY IT ON ME . YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM ... THAT I WAS THE ONE WHO KILLED THAT MAN . I CAN 'T- - I CAN 'T DO THAT . YES , YOU CAN . MULDER , IF I CAN SAVE YOU , LET ME . LET ME AT LEAST GIVE SOME MEANING TO WHAT 'S HAPPENED TO ME . [ Door Opens ] DANA ? HI , FOX . HI , MRS. SCULLY . - I HOPE I 'M NOT INTERRUPTING . - NO , NO , NO . I WAS JUST ON MY WAY OUT . HI .

PLEASE TELL ME YOU 'RE HERE WITH SEVERE CHEST PAINS . YOU SHOULD BE GLAD FOR WHY I 'M HERE- - TO PAY YOU SOME RESPECT . GO TO HELL . FOR YOUR CLEVERNESS AND YOUR RESOURCE , WHAT YOU MANAGED TO DO FOR SCULLY . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? WELL , BREACHING THE SECURITY AT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT FACILITY , FINDING THE CURE FOR HER DISEASE . WHAT I FOUND WAS USELESS . ON THE CONTRARY . IT 'S ESSENTIAL TO HER SURVIVAL . IF YOU LIKE , WE COULD STEP OUTSIDE AND I MIGHT EXPLAIN MYSELF . I 'M HERE TONIGHT AS A FRIEND , AGENT MULDER . HE PROMISED ME IT WOULD BE IN HERE . [ Frohike ] I 'LL BE DAMNED . IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME WHAT THE DEIONIZED WATER MIGHT BE FOR . - WHO KNEW IT WAS A MICROCHIP WE WERE LOOKIN ' FOR . - THIS IS A CURE FOR CANCER ? - IT MAY BE FOR SCULLY 'S . - HOW ? [ Mulder ] SHORTLY AFTER SHE WAS ABDUCTED , SHE DISCOVERED A SMALL METALLIC CHIP IMPLANTED SUBCUTANEOUSLY IN HER NECK . IT WAS JUST A SHORT TIME AFTER SHE HAD IT REMOVED THAT SHE DEVELOPED CANCER . - IT 'S UNREAL . - TOO FREAKIN ' AMAZING . WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE , FROHIKE , AND GRAB ME SOME TWEEZERS . [ Blevins ] MR. KRITSCHGAU , THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY ... AND FOR COOPERATING WITH THIS INVESTIGATION . WE HOPE YOU CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION ... THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE FORMAL CHARGES ... FOR THE MURDER OF DEFENSE EMPLOYEE SCOTT OSTELHOFF . MR. KRITSCHGAU , WE HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU WERE IN CONTACT WITH AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY ... JUST PRIOR TO THIS MAN 'S DEATH . - THAT 'S CORRECT . - AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE GIVEN THEM CLASSIFIED INFORMATION . WHAT MOTIVATED THIS ? MY KNOWLEDGE OF GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . UH , BEFORE- - BEFORE WE GO INTO ANY SPECIFICS ON THAT SUBJECT , I 'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A MORE POINTED QUESTION . DO YOU KNOW WHO KILLED SCOTT OSTELHOFF ? NO , I DON 'T . DO YOU KNOW OF ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN HIS DEATH AND AGENTS MULDER OR SCULLY ? NO . I 'M AWARE OF ONE DEATH IN CONNECTION , THOUGH . MY SON , WHO DIED EARLY THIS MORNING . MR. KRITSCHGAU , YOU 'RE EMPLOYED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE , IS THAT CORRECT ? [ Kritschgau ] TECHNICALLY . PART OF MY REMUNERATION HAS COME FROM ANOTHER SOURCE . A CONGRESSIONAL LOBBYING FIRM- - SOMETHING CALLED ROUSH . ROUSH ? ANY IDEA WHAT THAT IS ? NO , SIR . THIS IS CRAZY , JUST CRAZY . WELL , CRAZY IN WHAT SENSE ? IN THAT IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR SISTER 'S LIFE ? YOU 'RE NOT A DOCTOR . YOU HAVE NO PLACE EVEN SUGGESTING THIS SCIENCE FICTION . IT 'S NOT SCIENCE FICTION . HE 'S NEVER HEARD OF IT ! BILL . [ Sighs ] - HAVE YOU ? - NO , I HAVEN 'T . I THINK THERE 'S AN OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION HERE . [ Scully ] I THINK ... THAT EVERYBODY HERE HAS THEIR HEART IN THE RIGHT PLACE . BUT I NEED IT TO BE MY DECISION . DANA- - I KNOW YOU 'RE ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR ME , BILL , BUT I DON 'T THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS . DON 'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR ? YES . I AM . WOULD SHE HAVE TO STOP HER CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT ? [ Doctor ] TO BE HONEST , AT THIS POINT ... THE ONLY APPROACH I HAVE LEFT WITH HER PARTICULAR CANCER ... IS QUITE UNCONVENTIONAL . I 'D LIKE TO TRY THIS . YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS CRAP , DON 'T YOU ? YES , I DO . YOU SEE , SHE 'S YOUR BIG DEFENDER , BUT I THINK THE TRUTH IS SHE JUST DOESN 'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU . IF IT WORKS , I DON 'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK SHE THINKS . YOU 'RE A REAL PIECE OF WORK , YOU KNOW THAT , MR. MULDER ? WHY IS THAT ? BECAUSE I DON 'T THINK THE WAY YOU THINK ? BECAUSE I WON 'T JUST SIT PASSIVELY BACK AND WATCH THE FAMILY TRAGEDY UNFOLD ? YOU 'RE THE REASON FOR IT . AND I 'VE ALREADY LOST ONE SISTER TO THIS QUEST YOU 'RE ON . NOW I 'M LOSING ANOTHER . HAS IT BEEN WORTH IT ? I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN . HAVE YOU FOUND WHAT YOU 'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ? - NO . - NO . YOU KNOW HOW THAT MAKES ME FEEL ? IN A WAY , I THINK I DO . I LOST SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO ME . I LOST A SISTER . I LOST MY FATHER . ALL BECAUSE OF THIS THING I 'M LOOKING FOR . THIS WHAT ? LITTLE GREEN ALIENS ? YEAH . LITTLE GREEN ALIENS . YOU 'RE ONE SORRY SON OF A BITCH . THERE 'S NOT A LOT MORE TO SAY . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] ONE SORRY SON OF A BITCH SPEAKING . HOW 'S OUR PATIENT ? YOU DID FIND THE CHIP , DIDN 'T YOU , AGENT MULDER ? YES . I CAN IMAGINE THERE WAS SOME QUESTION AS TO ITS MEDICAL VALUE . WELL , THERE STILL IS . AND SO I HAVE YET TO EARN YOUR TRUST , IN SPITE OF MY GESTURE . [ Chuckles ] YOU COULD SAY THAT , YEAH . WELL , I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO OFFER YOU . I 'VE ARRANGED A MEETING I THINK YOU 'LL WANT TO ATTEND , MR. MULDER . TABASCO . IT CURES ANYTHING . I 'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND . YOU KNOW HIM OR SOMETHIN ' ? I THINK THAT 'S MY SISTER . SAMANTHA ? I WAS AFRAID I 'D NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN . HE ALWAYS TOLD ME SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO YOU THAT NIGHT . WHO ? WHO TOLD YOU THAT ? MY FATHER . I NEVER REALLY KNEW WHAT HAPPENED . I COULD NEVER PUT THE MEMORIES ALL BACK TOGETHER . BUT AS MUCH AS I TRIED TO REMEMBER , I TRIED MORE TO FORGET . WHY ? I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD ... AND FRIGHTENED TO DEATH . AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I WAS AN ORPHAN . BUT YOU CALL THAT MAN YOUR FATHER . SOMETIME LATER , I DON 'T KNOW HOW LONG , MY FOSTER PARENTS TOOK ME TO A HOTEL ROOM ... AND SAID THAT I WAS GONNA SEE MY FATHER . BUT YOU KNEW WHO YOUR FATHER WAS . I THOUGHT I KNEW . BUT HE TOLD ME THAT IT HAD ALL BEEN A SECRET , AND THAT HE AND MOM ... HADN 'T TOLD ANYONE TO PROTECT THE FAMILY . AND YOU BELIEVED THAT ? HE WAS SO KIND TO ME . AND HE WAS THE ONLY ONE I COULD REMEMBER FROM BEFORE WHAT HAPPENED . YOU DON 'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THAT NIGHT ? I REMEMBER ... YOU . I REMEMBER SOMETHING . MEN , AND- - AND THEN NOTHING . I CAN HELP YOU . YOU WERE ABDUCTED , SAMANTHA . I CAN HELP YOU TO REMEMBER . I DON 'T WANT TO , FOX . I DON 'T . THEN WHY COME HERE AT ALL ? MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT HE 'D FOUND YOU . YOU WANTED TO SEE ME VERY BADLY- - THAT YOU 'D BEEN LOOKING FOR ME FOR A LONG TIME . IS THAT TRUE ? I 'M SO SORRY , FOX . AND I WISH THAT I 'D KNOWN HOW TO FIND YOU . WHAT YOU 'VE BEEN TOLD- - I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME , OKAY ? WHAT YOU 'VE BEEN TOLD BY THAT MAN ... MAY NOT BE TRUE . WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ? BECAUSE THE MAN THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE ... HAS KNOWN WHERE I 'VE BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WHY WOULDN 'T HE TELL ME ? I DON 'T KNOW . BUT I THINK HE 'S KEPT A LOT OF THINGS FROM YOU . I DON 'T BELIEVE YOU . HE 'S BEEN A GOOD FATHER TO ME . HE 'S GIVEN ME A LIFE , AND HE CARED FOR ME WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE . THEN I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME- - COME WITH ME TO SEE MOM . - MOM IS ALIVE ? - YES . AND I KNOW SHE 'D LIKE TO SEE YOU VERY , VERY MUCH . - I CAN 'T . - WHY NOT ? THIS IS TOO MUCH . I DIDN 'T WANNA COME HERE AT ALL , FOX . I WAS AFRAID TO SEE YOU . I HAVE ANOTHER LIFE NOW .

I KNOW THE TRUTH . DO YOU ? I SPOKE TO ONE OF YOUR MEN . AND YOU KNOW HE 'S NOT A LIAR ? I 'VE SEEN ENOUGH TO KNOW HE 'S NOT A LIAR , YEAH . YOU 'VE SEEN BUT SCANT PIECES OF THE WHOLE . WHAT MORE CAN YOU SHOW ME ? THIS MAN YOU SPOKE TO , MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU , HE 'S DECEIVED YOU WITH BEAUTIFUL LIES . HE 'S TOLD YOU THAT EVERYTHING YOU 'VE EVER BELIEVED ... ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE IS UNTRUE . WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? AS I SAID , I 'M OFFERING YOU A CHANCE TO KNOW THE TRUTH . IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT ? QUIT THE F.B.I. COME WORK FOR ME .

I 'LL MAKE A STATEMENT RIGHT HERE . CLONING WILL CONTINUE . THE HUMAN MIND WILL CONTINUE TO INQUIRE INTO THIS . HUMAN CLONING WILL TAKE PLACE , AND IT 'LL TAKE PLACE IN MY LIFETIME .

AS YOU 'RE SET TO TESTIFY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF LATER TODAY , I 'VE RECEIVED ALARMING FORENSIC EVIDENCE ... FROM THE MAN 'S BODY FOUND IN YOUR APARTMENT . I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND BALLISTIC DATA ... MATCHING YOUR SERVICE WEAPON , AGENT MULDER . WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ? I 'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY . BUT UNLESS YOU CAN OFFER UP SOMEONE ELSE WHO MIGHT HAVE FIRED THE KILL SHOT , EVERYTHING POINTS TO YOU AS THIS MAN 'S MURDERER . ARE YOU PREPARED TO GIVE TESTIMONY ... YOU 'RE NOT THE MAN WHO FIRED THE SHOT ? WHY AM I HERE ? THE MAN WORKED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE , AGENT MULDER . THE MAN WAS SPYING ON ME . DO YOU KNOW FOR WHOM ? AGENT SCULLY ... WAS PREPARED TO NAME THE MAN AT THE F.B.I ... WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS PLOT AGAINST YOU AND HER . WE BELIEVE SHE WAS GOING TO NAME ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER , WHOM WE HAVE LEARNED HAS BEEN WORKING INSIDE THE F.B.I. WITH A SECRET AGENDA . I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT . WE 'VE ACCUMULATED SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM . CAN YOU SHOW IT TO ME ? AGENT MULDER , IF YOU NAME THIS MAN TODAY IN YOUR TESTIMONY , WE CAN FILE CHARGES AGAINST HIM , CHARGES WHICH MAY VERY WELL EXONERATE YOU . NAME SKINNER AND SAVE MYSELF . THAT 'S WHAT I CALLED YOU HERE TO RECOMMEND . AS A FRIEND . I 'LL SEE YOU AT THE HEARING . GOOD MORNING . WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ? YOU HAVE A HEARING . YEAH . I CAME BY LAST NIGHT , BUT I DIDN 'T HAVE THE HEART TO WAKE YOU . CAME BY FOR WHAT ? MULDER , WHAT IS IT ? I WAS LOST LAST NIGHT . BUT AS I STOOD HERE , I THOUGHT I 'D FOUND MY WAY . I 'VE BEEN , UH- - I 'VE BEEN OFFERED A DEAL , A DEAL THAT COULD SAVE MY LIFE IN A WAY . AND THOUGH I 'D REFUSED THE DEAL EARLIER , I LEFT HERE LAST NIGHT WITH MY MIND MADE UP TO TAKE IT . A DEAL WITH WHO ? IT DOESN 'T MATTER . I 'M NOT TAKING THE DEAL . I 'M NOT TAKING ANY DEAL , NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING . WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING ? SECTION CHIEF BLEVINS DIRECTED ME TO IMPLICATE SKINNER- - TO NAME HIM AS THE MAN INSIDE IN THE F.B.I ... WHO MAY HAVE DECEIVED US BOTH . AND IF I NAME HIM , THEY 'LL PROTECT ME . ARE YOU GOING TO NAME HIM ? NO . THEN THEY 'LL PROSECUTE YOU . YEAH , IF THEY HAVE EVIDENCE AGAINST ME , THEY KNOW I KILLED THAT MAN . EVEN WITH THE BALLISTICS EVIDENCE , I CAN STILL BE THE SHOOTER . SCULLY , I CAN 'T LET YOU TAKE THE BLAME ... BECAUSE OF YOUR BROTHER , BECAUSE OF YOUR MOTHER , AND BECAUSE I COULDN 'T LIVE WITH IT . TO LIVE THE LIE YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT , LIKE THESE MEN WHO DECEIVE US ... WHO GAVE YOU THIS DISEASE . WE ALL HAVE OUR FAITH , AND MINE IS IN THE TRUTH . THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE ... IF YOU 'D ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND ? BECAUSE I KNEW YOU 'D ... TALK ME OUT OF IT IF I WAS MAKING A MISTAKE . [ Door Opens ] YOU 'LL BE IN MY PRAYERS .

MAINSTREAM , I WAS PAIRED WITH SPECIAL AGENT DANA SCULLY , WHO I BELIEVED WAS SENT TO SPY ON ME- - TO DEBUNK MY INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE PARANORMAL . THAT AGENT SCULLY DID NOT FOLLOW THESE ORDERS ... IS A TESTAMENT TO HER INTEGRITY AS AN INVESTIGATOR , A SCIENTIST AND A HUMAN BEING . SHE HAS PAID DEARLY FOR THIS INTEGRITY . [ Blevins ] AGENT MULDER , AGENT SCULLY LIED STRAIGHT-FACED TO THIS PANEL ABOUT YOUR DEATH . SHE LIED BECAUSE I ASKED HER TO . BECAUSE I HAD EVIDENCE OF A CONSPIRACY- - A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WE 'VE ALREADY HEARD TESTIMONY TO THESE ALLEGATIONS , AGENT MULDER . AND A CONSPIRACY INTENDED TO DESTROY THE LIVES ... OF THOSE WHO WOULD REVEAL ITS TRUE PURPOSE ; TO CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS ON UNWITTING VICTIMS ...

THIS AFTERNOON WHEN YOU NAMED BLEVINS , HOW DID YOU KNOW ? I DIDN 'T . I JUST GUESSED . WELL , IT WAS A HELL OF A GUESS . BLEVINS HAD BEEN ON PAYROLL FOR FOUR YEARS ... TO A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY CALLED ROUSH , WHICH IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO ALL THIS . WELL , I 'M SURE WHATEVER CONNECTIONS THERE WERE , THEY 'RE BEING ERASED RIGHT NOW . THEY 'RE CLEANING UP , TAKING EVERYTHING AWAY . NOT EVERYTHING . SCULLY 'S CANCER 'S GONE INTO REMISSION . THAT 'S UNBELIEVABLE NEWS . IT 'S THE BEST NEWS I COULD HAVE EVER HEARD .

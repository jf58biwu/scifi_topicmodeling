 You guys still here ? Shouldn 't you be gone ? Talk to the anal-retentive chef here . Why can 't you just buy your lunch like the normal kids ? Hey , I 'm just trying to eat a little healthier . Senior portraits are coming up , you know . Here . I 'll cut out the middleman . - Whoo ! - ( Tingling ) - What was that ? - Instant liposuction . I just took ten pounds off you . Now motor . Ten pounds ? Where 'd you put them ? Who cares ? Let 's rock ! Bye ! Have a nice day ! Sayonara , lumpy . Now for some fun . ( Beeping ) A steaming cup of decaf mocha and a virtual reality adventure : this is my time . Mmm . MAN : Welcome to Virtual Vision 's " Private Eye Adventure . " Sit back , relax , and enjoy your film noir virtual experience . LISA : It was another wet , moonlit night in the naked city where life 's as cheap as a cup of Joe and twice as black . Whenever there 's a mystery I 'm that special someone everybody 's looking for . The name 's McGuffin- - Legs McGuffin . I had an office in a rundown walk-up at the corner of bedlam and squalor . It was a quiet night ... ( Knock at door ) Until I got that knock on the door . I wasn 't expecting trouble- - Which is usually when it showed up . In this business , you had to be ready for anything . ( Trigger cocking ) Did I mention life was cheap ? It wasn 't my birthday , so what joker was sending me presents ? It was the Cadillac of Garden Gnomes : compact , porcelain and sassy . But for a hard-drinking dame with no garden it was also useless . Nice gnome . Yours ? That was when he walked into my life . He had gams that went all the way to his feet and eyes in the front of his head- - two of them . Add to that a couple of ears , a cute button nose and a pie hole due South of his nostrils ... He was a total package , this one and I couldn 't wait to unwrap him . - Didn 't catch your name . - Didn 't throw it . - You 're Quick . - No ... I 'm Roger . Roger DeSwans . Of the Newport DeSwans ? The same . Everyone knew the DeSwans . They had the stink of old money , and this one reeked like a tuna boat . He was fancy albacore all the way . So , what can I do for you , Mr. DeSwans ? - I want you to solve a murder . - Whose ? Mine . If you don 't mind me saying , DeSwans , you 're looking pretty ... Healthy for a dead guy . Somebody slipped me poison , see ? Luminous poison . " Luminous " ? As in " glowing " ? It 's spreading already . By this time tomorrow I could literally moon you . McGuffin ... I need you to find my killer . Find him , find the antidote . The clock is running out . I 've got 24 hours before I 'm D.O.A. This is a big city , Mr. DeSwans . Can you think of anyone who 'd want to see you in the six-feet-under club ? Got a phone book ? You don 't have time for jokes , Mr. DeSwans . It wasn 't a joke . DeSwans had a lot of enemies . He was about as popular as a wooden biscuit in Dogtown . So I figured I 'd start at the beginning . Aaron Aaxelrod didn 't have a lot of friends but he sure had a lot of fans . What 's your beef , McGuffin ? I 'm trying to run a business , and you come down here shaking my monkey tree ? You know this man ? - Never seen him before . - Wrong answer . All right . I 'll ... sing . Um , I know him , and I know who poisoned him . Ooh ... ooh ! Talk about your lucky breaks . The first man on the first page of the phone book had answers . It was easy- - too easy . - ( Two gunshots ) - ( Aaxelrod screaming ) Okay . Now it was getting harder . Well , well ... What do we have here ? My first real clue : silk- - high grade , dense weave ... this was jockey silk . ANNOUNCER : The horses are entering the gate ... and they 're off . It was time to see a man about a horse . I knew my man as soon as I saw him- - Shag McCann . A two-bit jockey at a two-bit racetrack . Pale , scrawny , twitchy . Was he just socially awkward or hopped up on something ? I decided to find out . - Who do you like in the fifth , Shag ? - Who wants to know , Toots ? Your tailor . You 're not taking me alive , Copper ! - Yi-yi ! Hey ! - So , he wanted it the hard way . Fine by me . ( Tires squealing ) Ooh ! Oh , ooh ... Ooh ! Now ... are ... you ... ready to talk ? You 're good , Legs . Real good . Cut the baloney , pony boy . What do you know about pharmaceuticals ? You know darn well . " Pony-go " ? " Equi-spaz " ? - You 've been doping the ponies ? - And how . I 'm a little tall for a jockey . Hopping up the horses is the only way for me to win a race . - You ever drug a human , Shag ? - A human ? ! Gosh , no . That 'd be dirty pool . I was beginning to think I was as off-base as a blind shortstop . But then I saw it . This has got luminous poison in it . Yeah , but it 's safe for horses , see ? - What quack prescribed this stuff ? ! - I 'll talk ! I 'll talk ! The man who prescribed the luminous poison was ... ( Two gunshots ) His name is Dr. Danglers . He 's a dentist . - You want his address ? - Much obliged . ( Horse neighing ) ( Gulping noises ) Dr. Milo Danglers- - horse dentist extraordinaire . Sorry , Doc . Didn 't mean to interrupt happy hour . I , uh ... I keep some around for purely medicinal purposes . The old wbones stank of hooch . Just being around him made my cuts hurt . So , Mr. Pony Dentist ... Look any gift horses in the mouth lately ? ( Chortling ) That 's good . That 's very clever . Let 's drink to that one , shall we ? I want you to tell me a story ... And it 'd better have " luminous poison " in the title . ( Yelps ) I 'll tell you what you want to know . Uh ... luminous poison- - right . I , uh , prescribed some just this morning . I know- - for that jockey Shag McCann . Oh , no . Uh , for that millionaire playboy Roger DeSwans . So , DeSwans had his teeth done by a horse dentist . He must have had one lousy hmo . You made a chump out of me ! - Oh ! - What 's the game , DeSwans ? The horse doc says he gave you the luminous poison . He 's lying . Come on . Use that pretty head of yours . Why would I try to poison myself ? I swear , Legs ... I 'm being square with you . Square this , sugar . Ooh ! Aah ! Oh ! Aah ! Why ... do ... you ... keep ... slapping ... me ? - Oh ! Aah ! - It 's a rhythm thing . - ( Sighs ) - I 'm done now . It 's okay . ( Gulps ) I deserve it . I 'm a bad , bad man and I 'm going to die in less than five hours . Worst part of all is , I 'm going to ... Die a vir ... a vir-vir ... ( Grunts and groans ) Why can 't I say that word ? - Hays code . - Bastards . Listen , whether I 'm lying or not there 's one thing for sure : I 'm a dying man and I deserve one last request . - What did you have in mind ? - ( Sighs ) That was nice . I 'm a rich man and I could have anything I desire but , somehow , you 're all I want right now . You make it sound tempting , Mr. DeSwans but you and I we 're from two different worlds and love hasn 't been kind to me of late . Don 't deny your passion , Legs . What we could have together might be something ... - beautiful . - Ah , what the hell . After all , it was only a V.R. Fantasy and he did have those gams . You bet you , baby . Gams all the way down to my feet . How 'd he know I thought that ? Unless he could hear my hard-boiled narration . DESWAN : Uh-oh . She was onto me . - I heard that ! - Heard what ? I didn 't say nothing . Okay ... it was at that moment that I decided to kick him square in the goolies . - Oh ! - What 's the deal , DeSwans ? Uh ... All right , you got me . I 'm not really DeSwans . It 's me , Chett . I know . Everyone in this V.R. Fantasy is based on someone in my life . No , no , no , no . It 's really me- - Chett . The real Chett . I jacked into your fantasy . What 's the big idea , Mr. Nosey ? This is my fantasy , not yours . You 're ruining my story . What do you want me to say ? I took a shot . I figured if you thought I was dying maybe you 'd pound the posturepedic with me . You made this entire thing up just to get me horizontal ? Flattered , huh ? Did you lie about poisoning yourself , too ? No . That part is true . I paid that boozehound horse-odontist to juice me with the luminous poison . What kind of idiot poisons himself ? An idiot with a dream . ( Chuckles ) Hey ... relax . I hid the antidote in the garden gnome . I 'm the one who sent it . Well , let 's get it . I don 't understand . I left it right here . Somebody swiped it . So ? No big . It 's just a V.R. Scenario . It 's not like I 'm going to die in real life , right ? ( Chuckles ) This is the part where you , uh , laugh and reassure me . If you die in the V.R. World , you die for real . Oh , well , that 's just great ! Did you ever think to put a warning label on the helmet ? I did . Holy monkeys . I 'm a dead man walking . I 've got four hours till I croak . Relax . I 'm a detective . I 'll solve the case and save your life . Yeah . Right . You really think you can do it ? No way . I 've been playing this thing for two weeks and I still can 't get past level one . ( sobbing ) If it makes you feel any better I 'll grant you that last request . How can you think about sex at a time like this ? ! I 'm dying . Do you get that ? We 'll go back to the horse doctor and get more antidote . Oh , yeah . That 'll work . - I 'll take you up on that sex thing . - Too late . You snooze , you lose . Dr. Danglers ? There . - Is he dead ? - No . Drugged . How can you tell ? Now he 's never going to talk . Oh , yeah ? Watch this . 50cc 's of pure adrenaline . ( Moaning ) Let me try . ( Moaning ) Okay , start talking . Where 's the antidote ? Antidote ... is baloney boney bug butter . Good ol ' boys in a Pekinese Dollhouse . Smoke ' em if you got ' em , Leopold . He 's talking crazy talk . I got bugle wheaties in the woofer . Great . He 's high as a kite . At least he 's conscious now . That means we 're getting ose . Give me 50 more cc 's of the purple stuff . No purple . Purple burns . Listen to me . Your medicine cabinet is empty . Who took the antidote for the luminous poison ? Luminous boboom-inous and he 's moo-velous ... # When he 's in love . # Jockey ! Jockey , huh ? Come on , we 're off to Shag McCann . I said talk , Jock . Where 's the antidote ? ( Chuckling ) My God , you are an animal in this fantasy , aren 't you ? You blew your chance to find out . MAN : So , what 's the rumpus ? You beat up on one of us you beat up on all of us . Any way you want it , shortbread . Yeah , you and what army , dollface ? ( Smacking ) You ain 't so tough now , are you ? Lisa , this one 's moving . This one is moving . Play with him later , okay ? I need you over here . Now , where were we ? That 's right . You were about to sing . Hurry it up . I only have a half hour left . Spill it , Shag . Who took the antidote ? Okay . Okay . I 'll squeal . I know who took the antidote . His name is ... ( Screams ) Great googly-moogly . Will you look at this ? And the man from the Aaxelrod fan company was here just this morning to loosen the bolts . I can 't find the lights . Allow me . - So , what are we looking for ? - I don 't know yet . Just keep your eyes open . Something tells me that Aaron Aaxelrod isn 't as dead as I thought . Very clever , McGuffin . So , you 're right . He 's not really dead . You pulled a frame job on the jockey . - And swiped the garden gnome . - Darn tootin ' . Looking for this ? The antidote . Very good , Miss McGuffin . Except that you two losers walked right into my trap . I 've got the drop on you . And he 's about ready to drop . ( Laughing hysterically ) So , Lisa , is that it ? Do I win ? - Wyatt ? - Wyatt ? In the virtual flesh . I saw you guys and I figured I 'd join in on the fun . Wyatt , you don 't know what you 're doing . Don 't u hi-hat me , you dirty mug . I 'm giving you a one-way ticket to Palookaville . The same goes for the skirt , see ? Okay , Wyatt , game 's over . Chett 's dying for real . - I 've only got 30 seconds left . - Yeah . Dying . Right . Wyatt , he 's not kidding . Give him the antidote . - No way . - Ten seconds . - Sorry . - Five seconds . Wyatt ... in the name of all that 's ... ( Gagging ) Chett ! ( Laughing ) Top of the world , Ma ! Okay , game over . # I 'm the best . # - Now , let 's get out of here . - ( Softly crying ) You guys are faking ! I can tell . You are faking , right ? Chett , speak to me . Gotcha ... sucker . Ah , man . Yang , Yang , Yang , Yang , Yang . I actually had five minutes left . Hey , a really nice piece of acting back there . Right back atcha . And so , Legs McGuffin put another case to bed . CHETT : To bed ? - Chett , get out of my narration . - Sorry . WYATT : Hey , I can hear you guys . Let me try one . It was a dark and stormy night . LISA AND CHETT : Shut up ! Ah , man . Everyone 's having fun except me . Whoa ! Short guys . What 's up , fellas ? Hey , that 's the chump that got us beat up . - Yeah . - Yeah . - Yeah . - Get him .

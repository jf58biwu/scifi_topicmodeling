 Eric Sythe of the Hawaiian Liberation Organisation has disappeared after futile negotiations with Hawaiian governor Makena . The militant organization may resort to terrorism to make a statement . In New Orleans security forces are alert in preparation for the Futuresport World Championship . In response to the threat Tre Ramzey called the HLO : " A bunch ofsurferpunks trying to hog the best waves . " L.A. Rush are favorites to win this game ofthe century . We will be right back . Delivery . Just sign here . Everybody into the meat locker . Now ! - Status report . - Target Two is in position . What about Target One ? No sign . Those damn athletes are never on time . Cool head , baby . The Pharaoh will be here . We just have to wait for his royal entrance . Him and Torres in one shot . The traitor and the snoop . A glorious day for the revolution , huh ? - Wish me luck . - What is the hurry ? Pre-game interview . I must keep my sponsors happy . They have nothing to worry about . After this game your Popularity index will be higher than mine . is it possible to have a P.l. rating higher than yours ? What is it , 390 ? - 401 . - Not that you are keeping track . Who is doing the interview ? It is her , is it not ? Alex Torres interviewing Tre Ramzey on the championship pre-game . That must be worth 15 points . The network made her cover the game . It has been ten years since she did her story . They want a retrospective . - Nostalgia sells , you know . - Do not get nostalgic about her . Alex and I were over long ago . Besides , just look at you . - Who could compete with you ? - Nobody . And do not forget it . For the Pharaoh who has everything . - Quite a circus , is it not ? - Yes . Not like the good old days . Better get started . Rolling . Obike Fixx . Take one . We are here with Obike Fixx , the man who created Futuresport . Guilty as charged . - This is your first championship ? - l never liked the Pro Leagues much . And the League never liked you ? I nag them . Having a conscience can be expensive . You say the League does not give back to the community ? Yes . The League makes billions on Futuresport . But without the kids in the Downzone , they would not make a dime . - Alex ... - We are rolling . It is the network . Tre is on his way down . We will be back , when we finish with Fixx . I understand . Tre is ratings . I am just doo doo . - Can I have your prints ? - Later , kid . Anarchy , my girl . Check my board . The port stabilizer is tweaked . Whatever you say , captain . Way to accessorize . Thank you . Does anybody want to see a game ? Target One has made his entrance . When I give the word , just like we practiced . You may not quote me . I have not said a word . I am sorry . Mr. Ramzey has granted an exclusive with Alex Torres . If you have questions , you can watch Channel 90 like everybody else . - Thank you , coach . - You are late . " You are welcome , Tre . Anything for you . " Thank you , but you are still late . Thank me by winning the game . My contract is up for renewal . Obike Fixx. I never thought , I would see you at a pro game . Blame it on Alex . She can be very persuasive . I remember that . I am off. I will leave you to your business . Easy . I am having a victory party tonight . You should come . Win the game first , then party . - Okay. I am all yours . - l will try to contain my enthusiasm . - Over here . - Same old Alex . Always in charge . - ls this good ? - Yes . Rolling . Tremaine Ramzey . Take one . Ten years ago Tremaine Ramzey became famous after Channel 90 's report on the obscure game Futuresport . Now he is captain of L.A. Rush and here in New Orleans for his third consecutive Championship . - Mister Ramzey ... - What ? I know you got mad , when I dumped you , but do you have to call me " mister ? " Cut ! Two things . I would rather not be here . If it was up to me , I would still be in Hawaii . And it was I , who dumped you ! Despite what your biography says . You have read my book ? - Are you okay ? - Yes . This is a political action of the Hawaiian Liberation Organization . The HLO . Great . Alejandra Torres . Tremaine Ramzey . You are guilty of crimes against the Hawaiian people . - You two are really popular . - Come forward and face justice . How many ? - Show yourself ! - Nueve . Show yourself now ! Everyone on your feet now ! You have 10 seconds to comply . Anarchy , my board . I could take them if I had a ball . That is my girl . - Coach ? - Kamikaze 38 Float . If I do this , my P.l. rating will go through the roof . Do not blink . This is going to be good . Ramzey ! Show yourself ! We have gone lniki ! Go ! - Are you all right ? - Yes , thank you . Good . Now you owe me . Everybody all right ? Ladies and gentlemen , the L.A. Rush ! Ten years ago I did a report on a man who survived a tragedy . Tremaine Ramzey , a former basketball star had watched the league collapse in a terrible point shaving scandal . The league was dissolved , and Ramzey started playing a new game . Futuresport . Two teams . Five players each . One way to score . Put the ball in the goal . 1 point for a throw , 3 for a slam . Today it is the mostpopular game on Earth . And Ramzey is the star . But has the money , glory and publicity made the game better ? Or taken away everything that matters ? Three in a row . Watch out for Jamiston . He is a killer . Keep your passes crisp . And remember : Team first . - That means you too , Tre . - Team is what , I am all about . - Jet , I want you to cover Blake . - Forget it . Becker is mine . Jet handles Blake . Save yourself for offense . - l can handle him . - Do you not mean fondle him ? Let us beat on the Griffins , not each other . Let us do it . Tre ? - l have no time for interviews . - You saw the story ? - You think , I sold out . - Not only you . Everybody . Futuresport used to mean something . Now it is just a show . - Now you sound like Fixx . - The story was meant to be about him . How he invented the game to keep peace between the gangs . - But you focused on me . - l went for the ratings . Would you have been happier , if I had said no to the League ? - The money , fame and glory ? - l wish , I knew . I really wish , I knew . Ladies and gentlemen , it is time to play Futuresport . Tonight the world 's greatest teams go head to head in Championship 2025 . It is time for the captains to meet and wish each other a good game . Hey , Pharaoh. I heard about your run in with the HLO . - l hope you have enough for the game . - Enough to take you on , bean pole . Who knows , stubby ? Maybe I can teach you a few things . Stubby ? Did you think of that one yourself ? - That is right . - Let us get it on . Your mama . The teams are evenly matched . Both have stellar offenses and brutal defenses . And both teams have superstars playing flyer . For L.A. : The world 's most popular athlete Tremaine Ramzey . His nemesis is young Blake Becker . This could be Ramzey 's last season . Becker would love to take his place . The Pharaoh versus the Pretender in a battle for the crown . And the crowd loves the superstars . Here comes the race to the center . Becker is in possession and has 5 seconds to pass the ball before it becomes electrified . He passes to Carl Vunsch , who looks wide open . Where is the Rush defense ? Jet sails in and intercepts ! What a gutsy move for a new flyer . The pass goes to Ramzey . He is up and takes a shot ... And it is good ! This is Jet Yuen 's first season with the Rush . She hails from Singapore . It will be a long day . The first halfhas been brutal with the Griffins in the lead . The Rush must use teamwork , ifthey want to catch up . Jet hands off to Tre and Griffins try to stop him . Tre takes a hit but fires the ball . And there it is ! Tre isjust 17 points from breaking his own scoring record . Vunsch is looking for Becker . Vunsch evades the blocker . The ball starts to spark . Can he ride the lightning ? No ! Vunsch gets sparked for a 5 second hold . lfhe had held on to it , he might have gotten a slam . - Give me the ball ! - Ramzey will not pass the ball . Tre is more interested in his record than teamwork . And he scores . What the hell are you doing ? Let Jet handle Becker . - We are only down by nine . - We should be up by twenty . It has been a while since the Pharaoh gripped out a zap . But Tre ' s game has changed a lot . Some say not for the better . Second halfpromises the shoot-out , we expect from Ramzey and Becker . Ramzey has Jamiston on his tail . Jet yells for him to pass . But Ramzey does not pass and here comes trouble ! Jet Yuen takes out Jamiston ! Tre scores again . He is only a slam away from a new record . - You should have passed. I was open . - Did I score ? I scored . Ramzeys goal ties the score at 65 with seconds to go . Here is the deciding play . Griffins ' ball . Stolen by Tom Mayhew . No wonder he is called " Mayhem . " He has Ramzey on the whip . Jet is in position for a pass . Once again Ramzey goes by her . He wants the points himself . Here come the Griffins . What a move ! Ramzey needs only one to win . The 5 seconds are out . Tre rides the lightning . Turnover , Ramzey ! The ball is scooped up by Vunsch . Here comes Vunsch . And he scores ! The Griffins win ! What a major upset here . You were supposed to fix my stabilizer . Nice job ! I had no speed . - lt is your damn fault ! - Your stabilizer is purring ! - Then what the hell happened ? - Have you checked a mirror ? You should talk , Jet ! Great game . No matter what people say , we earned this win ! I dedicate this win to the Pan-Pacific Commonwealth and everybody in Australia ! What about the tension between the Com and North America ? Ifyou yanks mind your own business , everything will be peachy . Or the Com will do to you , what I did to Mayhem ! Ifthat Aussie wants a piece ofme , he knows where to find me . In Germany theysay : " Alles glisten is nicht necessarily geld . " That sums up , what happened today . Hey , Mom . We won ! No comment . I said , no comment ! And that ends our coverage for tonight . What ? No victory party ? No dancing girls ? Nothing ? - Did you not see the game ? - l saw it. lt hurt my eyes . Play like that in the Downzone and you might not live . - l do not play there anymore . - True . Maybe that is the problem . Sometimes you can get so high , you cannot see the ground . Come back to the old neighbourhood . You might remember , what really matters . And what does not . - What were you thinking ? - lt is not that bad . I will be champion next season . Then I announce our engagement . It will be like we planned , just a season later . You do not have another season . If I marry you now my P.l. rating will go into the sewer and I will not have that . Lorelei has left the building . Down . The plane is about to leave for home . You want to talk about it ? There is nothing to talk about . Open . - Hello , Edgar . - Welcome back , Mr. Ramzey . Supper is in the oven , your news clips are ready and your champagne is in the refrigerator . We lost , Edgar . Slings and arrows , sir . You have my sympathy . - Will Ms. Lorelei bejoining us ? - l lost her too . We broke up . Ms. Anarchy anticipated that when she upgraded myprogram . Something about saving the gene pool . Ifyour romance failed , l was to play this recording . It is hard to believe , four words could give me so much pleasure : - " l told you so . " - l will delete Ms. Lorelei 's name . Good idea . Play my messages . You suck , Ramzey ! Cut . Give me somebody I know . Mr. Ramzey , Ohmforce Sportswear want you to know , that we appreciate your being our spokesman this season . However ... Next . I guess , you are at home licking your wounds . But me and the girls are planning to party ! On second thought ... Give me a summary of the calls . You have 7 more messages . Three from your agent one from your lawyer , two from yoursponsors . - And one from Ms. Torres . - Alex ? Play that one . Tre , I must talk to you . It is important . Tomorrow , game time . 39-14 . You there . Move along . Tre , I am glad you remembered . 39 points , 14 assists . My stats the day you made your documentary . I could never forget . Want to walk ? - You said it was important . - Yes. lt is the HLO . - Losers . What about them ? - Do not write them off so fast . I have been making a report on the Hawaiian Separatist Movement . Tre , the HLO are dangerous . Even their own are afraid of them . I thought they were small time . Once , maybe . But things are changing . They have a lot ofmoney . - Let us take them . - Wait . Let us see , what she knows . They are building up for something big . The attack on us was to show people , they mean business . - l know that look . - What look ? That right there . You want to go up against them . I need your help . The network will not run my piece. lt is too political . - But you are a prominent Hawaiian . - l am a quarter Hawaiian . - l only go there for the games . - But you stood up to them . You called them punks . And when they tried to get you , you made fools of them . If you speak out against them , we can force people to listen . Maybe prevent theirplans and save many lives . Enough . Let us take them . I have missed this . - Missed what ? - The energy , the causes . - The pursuit of truth and justice . - So you will do it ? Fixx ? Easy , man . The ambulance is on it 's way . Tre ? I have died and gone to heaven . And all the angels look like Alex . It must be the drugs . - l am glad you are okay . - Thanks to you . That grenade was the HLO version of viewer feedback , huh ? Everyone is a crititc . - When do we do our story ? - We do not . The HLO beat us to it . They have launched new bombings . Mostly on the islands . Military bases , government buildings , the works . - l am not spreading sunshine , am I ? - Good news was never your specialty . - Next time I will not be depressing . - Will there be a next time ? That is up to you . Alex ? Thank you for stopping by . Futuresport star Tre Ramzey was released from hospital today after escaping an HLO attack . In Honolulu the governor has asked for troops to battle the terrorism . The Pan-Pacific Commonwealth has threatened to intervene militarily to protect the Separatists . Stay tuned for Hawaiian Crisis . Hey , how are you doing ? I have got it. I will handle it . Do me a favor . Spread the word . I am doing an autograph session . Half an hour . One print per person . Then find Fixx . Tell him I want to talk to him . If you play your cards right , you can get autographs too . It was a joke . If you sell it on the net , I will personally kick your butt . Mister Tre . Vayase. I have business . That means everybody . Yes , scatter . Let us walk . Thank you for helping me and Alex. I owe you . I could not let you get killed in my neighbourhood . - lt would make me look bad . - l make you look bad a lot , huh ? I cannot help but wonder . If you had been in Alex ' special , you would be star instead of me . Maybe. lf l would have wanted it . But that is not , what the sport is about . - So , what can I do for you ? - l have a problem with HLO . I have a problem with HLO . I need your help . I have league security watching me , so I am covered . But Alex ... She has nobody . I hoped , you could keep an eye on her , hire some ronin. I have the money . Why do you think , I have that kind of pull ? This is the Downzone . Everybody knows you are the man . True . All right . Let me see , what I can do . But you have to come around more often . - Deal . - l will hold you to that . Thank you . - How is it ? - Not bad at all . Our sponsors were very generous . 10 million to cover our operations . And it is all untraceable . Too bad you will not get to spend it . - Have you lost something ? - Who do you think , you are ? I know exactly , who I am . And you should too . You are in my neighbourhood . I do not like uninvited guests . Let me guess . Obike Fixx . - l was hoping to talk to you . - You had better talk quickly . Governor Makena 's motorcade was ambushed on his way to negotiations . Hawaiian Separatists have issued a declaration ofindependence . Mr. Ramzey , you have a visitor . Let her in please , Edgar . Welcome . I assume , I can thank you for the men who are shadowing me . is someone shadowing you ? I will just ... - l do not need babysitting . - That is , what I said to the league . Do you know , what they told me ? " You are too valuable to risk . " That is sweet of them . What are you making ? - Spicy Pharaoh Rolls . - What is that ? A secret for me to know and you to find out . I do not know . Are you afraid ? Alex Torres , the fearless reporter ? Bring it on . That is , what I am talking about . Not bad ? - Your reports are scary stuff . - lt will get worse . According to my sources the Com are sending a fleet to Hawaii . In response our military is on alert . There could be a war . - l thought the UN were negotiating . - The UN have no teeth . And no P.l. rating . - What are you thinking ? - lf we go to war , people will die . Hawaiians , North Americans , Coms . And the casualties have no P.l. They will be Downzoners . People too poor to dodge the draft , or bribe their way off the front . Like the kids playing Futuresport out in the street . If I hold a press conference , can you get me worldwide coverage ? Well , you are the Pharaoh . Even though your rating has slipped , you still have the President beat by 1 0 points . - What did you have in mind ? - A publicity stunt . The biggest , stupidest publicity stunt in history . I suppose , you were expecting a retirement announcement . I hate to disappoint , but I am not giving up the game . Not today . I know , I cannot play forever . And I would like to make a difference . Futuresport in the Downzones was a substitute for gang warfare . We settled scores without using violence . Now , ifit worked in the Zones , why could it not work in the world ? The Com and North America are preparing a giant turf battle . No rules , no holds barred . The winner takes all . If that happens , a lot of people will die . If we are acting like Downzoners , why not go all the way ? So on behalf of my gang , the North American Alliance , l challenge the Com to a game ofFuturesport . Our team against yours . The winner gets respect , bragging rights and Hawaii . I know , what you think . " The Pharao has lost his mind . " Maybe I have . But look at it this way . Which would you prefer ? One game ofFuturesport , or a war ? The ball is in your court . Thank you . I cannot believe Honolulu agreed . Staking everything on some game ? They had no choice . Our Com advisors made it clear , that nobody wants a war . There would be no war . You said , the Mainland would back . And I was right . They agreed to play Ramzey 's idiotic game . Now we can gain independence without guns . And the loyalists in Honolulu can do nothing about it . - But what if the Com loses ? - That would be unfortunate . We just have to make sure the Com wins . is that not right , Mr. Fixx ? Like Tre said : The winner takes all . What is this shit ? - We have been drafted . - Yes , I got the e-mail . I want to find Ramzey and shove it up his ass ! Feel free . But do it after the game . I know , what you are thinking . This is a P.l. raising scam . You are wrong . This is real . I am trying to stop a war . I need your help . All of you . - l think , you believe that shit . - Not me . This is vintage Pharaoh bullshit . You do not believe me ? I do not care . Look at it this way : Win this game and you are heroes . You can write your own ticket . Personal apperances , TV contracts ... Maybe they will name a perfume after Willard here . There he is . Cash and P.l. ratings . The Tremaine I know and love . Think what you want , all of you . Just as long as you play . What about the rest of you ? is anybody leaving ? Well , then ... Let us get to work . We should have put a bomb on this . Then the NAA would have no team . You have to do this my way . No bombs . Nobody gets hurt . Getting a conscience ? If I did not have one , I would not be doing this . - l thought , you did it for the money . - Money for his people , Keahi . 5 million euros can go a long way in the Downzones . If they can avoid a war , my people do not care what flag flies over Hawaii . A man after my own heart . So what is our next move ? Let us try it from the top . That is it ! Becker , you should have passed the ball to Ramzey . When I am in a key situation , I ask myself : " What would King Tut over there do ? " He would not have passed it to me . Listen , you slapdick ... He is right . I would not have passed it . Then you are a slapdick , too . Stairs . 50 sets . Both of you . - ls he fucking serious ? - He is serious . - Running out of gas , old man ? - No , but I have a pain in my butt . - ls it hemorrhoids ? - Yes. I named them Becker . Hey , scan that . That is it . You can stop . - How many was that , thirty ? - Are you getting senile ? - You two ! - Should we listen ? - Why start now ? - First one to the top . It looks like love to me . - Winner and still champion ! - What ? I just smoked you . - Do not make me show you again . - Why not ? Because I can barely stand , much less walk . That was the most idiotic display of macho bushido ever . With men like you running the world , it is no wonder it is such a mess . Down with the Patriarchy . Power to the Goddess . Now I am not going to ask if you need an equipment manager . Wait . Stay . We need all the help , we can get . Sorry for what I said after the game . I had no one else to blame . If you want foregiveness , you have to do a lot more than apologize . But it is a start . Anarchy is in the house ! - And so are Becker 's pants ! - Winner and still champion ! I have the rosters for the Com team starting with Hatchet Jack Jamiston . Jet Yuen . - ls Jet playing for them ? - Singapore is part of the Com . And so is Okinawa , which means Otomo Akira . And rounding out the starters : Sebastian Krajenski . And Kiwi Madigan . - Not " Down Under " . She is a psycho . - Yes , good company for you . - Five starters , five all stars . - We have a game . Stars do not win games . Teams win games . - l just worry about staying alive . - Oh , shut up . - You look as happy , as I feel . - This whole thing sucks . My brother lives in Honolulu . The HLO almost got him killed . - So why are you here ? - Pan-Pacific Unity and all that crap . Ladies and gentlemen . Thank you for volunteering . I am glad to see your love of sport , your dedication to the Com and your sympathy for our brothers and sisters in Hawaii . My name is Neville Hodgkins , your team 's government liaison . - lnternal security ? - What do you think ? If you need anything at all , do not hesitate to come to me . I know , you will make people back home very proud . Or else ... - Does the back still bother you ? - No , I feel great . How are you doing ? I am fine . But I would like the doctor to take a look at that . If you get hurt , the league will have my hide . - Whatver you say , coach . - Tremaine ... This is a noble thing , you are doing. I am proud of you . - Thank you , coach . - Thank you for making me part of it . You are actually doing this ? You should be proud . The idea of Futuresport is to stop a fight . Remember your last non-pro game ? - Against Playa NWC . - For the right to Sawtelle Park . I never kept track of , what the games were for . - Remember what they did to Carlos ? - Yes. I wish I did not . This game with the the Com is no exhibition , but a territorial fight . Street rules , Tre . Before , during and after the game . - Will the Com mess with us ? - They are much nastier than NWC . I do not think , I can protect you . - lt is too late for me to quit . - ls that right ? I never liked you becoming pro . I thought , you were a sellout . You said : " No , I have a right . " ln this society money is respect . And you deserve respect . But here is a news flash . A dead man cannot earn a thing . Welcome back , Mr. Ramzey . - How did you get inside ? - l asked politely . Sir , feel free to melt my circuits . I apologize . Shall I call security ? No , absolutely not . It is quite all right . - Would you like a drink ? - l would love one . In my own house . My favorite . You remembered . How did it go ? It could have been better . But at least we have a team . If the NAA and the Com keep their promise , we could have something . I think , you have changed . - You just remind me of someone . - Who is that ? An amazing guy . Smart . Handsome . Wore his heart on his sleeve . An ex basketball player , who began playing Futuresport in the streets . - He went pro ten years ago . - Sold his soul for fame and fortune . - You know him ? - He and I were close once . But I have lost touch with him . I think it is never too late to make up with an old friend . - Do you know , what you are doing ? - Yes . - Are you awake ? - l am a light sleeper . How do you feel ? My back is killing me , but pretty damn good . You ? I feel better , than I have in a long time . I have something for you . I wanted to give you this , before you left me . But I never had the opportunity , so now I will give it to you . It is beautiful . - Why will it not open ? - The hinges are frozen shut . I do not know , what is inside . My mom said , it was a family secret . - lt is your mom 's ? - And her mom 's before her . - l cannot take this . - Please. I want you to have it . Keep it on until the game is over . Just for luck . - Since when are you superstitious ? - Athletes always are . Sir , sorry to interrupt , but you have a message . - Not now. I am about to get busy . - lt is extremely urgent , sir . I am sorry. I must reprogram my house . Put it through . Pharaoh , I heard your doctor suggested back surgery . - Who are you ? - A friend with a little advice . Go in for the surgery . Do not play against the Com . Or a bad back will be the least ofyour worries . is that Capetown Sables calling to confirm their offer ? Did they pay ? - Has anybody seen Coach ? - He must be late . Coach is never late . Security let him in an hour ago He is meditating again . Hey , Buddah . You scared us for a second . He fell asleep while meditating . Coach , we are all here . - Who authorized Douglas ' murder ? - l did. ls that a problem ? Yes. I agreed to help to keep people from getting hurt . - That is , what you are doing . - Douglas is dead . So ? That is one man . In a war millions would die and most of them would be Downzoners . Stop that by helping us . - l always keep my promises . - That is , what I like to hear . - Do you want to talk about it ? - lt was not supposed to happen . That was the whole point of the game . Prevent people from getting killed . It was not your fault . Douglas believed in your cause . - But he did not have to die for it . - You did not kill him , the HLO did . They should be held accountable for it . What if it does not work ? What if we play the game and North America and the Com still go to war ? There are 10.000 NAA marines in ships off shore Honolulu . Not to mention the Com fleet waiting somewhere in the Pacific . And no one is fighting yet because of you . You have kept the soldiers alive . And maybe they will not fight at all . You owe it to them to not give up and give it a try . And you owe it to Douglas . I am sorry to keep you waiting . Where is Willard ? Gone . He said it was not worth the risk . - Are there any volunteers ? - Not one coach wants to take over . - Are they afraid for their health ? - Yes , and the salary sucks . But I found one person stupid enough to take the job ... me . I have been playing for ten years . I know every trick in the book . - This is too important to give up . - Spare us the nobility act , Ramzey . How much will this boost your P.l. rating ? 1 0 points ? 20 ? I fired my P.R. firm this morning . So sit down , Mayhem . Sit down and look at this . I have drawn up new offensive sets and incorporated new plays . They are all keyed to Becker . You want me to score ? Have you bumped your head ? If I call the shots , people will expect me to hog all the glory . So I will set a new assist record . Provided you can score the goals . Watch me . And I want you to meet our new defensive coordinator . - Great . Mr. Amateur Hour ? - He invented the game . Show respect . Better . Maybe this was a mistake . It might have been a mistake . And Becker , you are making it . We are playing by street rules , which you did not learn at Notre Dame . Fine . So who are these guys ? Our new cheerleaders ? Your bodyguards . They are going to watch your backs . I do not like you . Let us get to work . - l did not expect to see you here . - That makes two of us . It means a lot to Tre , that you are helping him out . Sometimes I think , he might be doing a good thing . Maybe it is ten years late , but I owe you an apology . When you invited me down , you wanted a story about gangs settling their problems in peace . Instead you got this . I am responsible for that . - Did you plan it ? - No. I went along for the ride . - And you got hurt. I am sorry . - No problem . Water under the bridge . Game time in five hours . And no matter yourpolitics this will be one of the greatest sporting events ever . Tell me , this is a great idea . - But tell me slowly . - You are doing a good thing . Win or lose , you are giving it your best shot . " lt is how you play the game . " When are you getting here ? The game does not start for another 5 hours . You should not be there yet . As a player l was always late . - But as coach ... - Security alert ! - Alex , what is going on ? - l do not know . Edgar , give me a wide view . Ramzey , let me make this quick . Lose the game , or your girl dies . Alex has been kidnapped by the HLO . - But the Rastaman was watching her . - He is missing too . - What do we do ? - She is not my girl . Mayhem is right . I will take care of it . I found her . Or the tracker you put in her locket . - You put a trace on Alex ? - Paranoia is your friend . - Nagatek ? What are they doing there ? - We should call the police . No way . Alex will get killed in the crossfire . - l will get her out of this . - l am coming with you . - No , it is too risky . - Do you have to be such a hot dog ? This is exactly , what you did in the Championship . Try to win by yourself . Did you forget , we are a team ? - She and I are coming along . - Me too . All right . - l do not know what to say . - Try " thank you . " Thank you . - Are you coming ? - No . My mom did not raise a fool . If you are not back by game time , I am keeping your endorsement money . Nice shot . - l am the best in the division . - Just barely . Here . You guys watch the deck . Everybody else with me . - Now where ? - Your guess is as good as mine . We might as well go this way . Maybe we should split up . Fixx ? - What are you doing here ? - Do you not get it ? It is like those old movies . The cavalry coming to the rescue . - That is not it , is it ? - No . - How long ? - A couple of weeks . How much money does the League donate to the Downzones each year ? Ten hundred kay . The HLO gave ten times that in a week . - That money can do much good . - Then why help us ? I do not like them and I am keeping their money . - l do not trust him . - l do . One hour until game time and the NAA locker room is shut . We do no know , what the Pharaoh is tellig his team . He had better tell them to lose . At least for your sake . Mr. Sythe . I just saw your man Tre . Bring her . It feels good . Autograph ? Flyers ... Hold your hand every second . - Gonzales , are you all right ? - l will be okay . Go get Alex . She went around the corner . Look out for Sythe ! I will give your boyfriend credit . He has guts . I am sorry , that you must suffer for it . Alex ... Come out wherever you are . Aloha , baby . Now it is on . Let us go . Amplified reflexes . Not too shabby , huh ? - Nice move . - Where is Tre ? Come here , sweetheart . Pathetic . Look at you . The fallen hero . You should have had that back surgery , Tre . - Ow ! - Tell me about it . I came to save you , and you end up saving me . Yes , get it , man . That is enough . I hate to break up this tender moment , but do you not have a game to play ? We have gotten word that the NAA locker room is empty . Ifthey do not show up , we have a forfeit on our hands . - So your friends did the job . - Amateurs . But useful . The NAA team has arrived . The police say , those who detained the team are in custody . Here they come ! The game will go on ! It is hard to believe this game will replace war , and that Ramzey and Becker are on the same team . But with Jamiston and Yuen playing for the Com , war may break out here . Let us play Futuresport ! The battlecry from Ramzey . This game is very important . Destroy them . Here is the openingjump . Jamiston wipes Ramzey ! Jet Yuen has possession . To Krajenski . An easy score ! Ramzey has Jamiston all over him . He finds Becker , but gets hit . Beckerscores ! This is war . That was a cheap shot . We are playing by street rules , you stupid fuck ! Cocksucker . - He kicked the shit out of me ! - That is the idea . - You want substitution ? - No . Gonzales is wounded . If they kick my ass , you will be open . The NAA are playing superphysical now . Mayhew sweeps a path for Becker . Mayhew is down , but Beckerputs it home ! - Are you all right ? - What the fuck do you think ? What was that ? Blake scored . They will soon be out of players . Then let them try to score . Watch yourself . Our keeper has his eye on you . Red seventeen ! Becker has the ball . But Jamiston slams Mayhew ! Beckerscores ! But Mayhew is still down . This game has new rules . I am going to kill him ! Fucking son-of-a-bitch ! - lt is broken . Medic ! - Park , you are in . Fucking cocksucker ! Ramzey , you are next ! The Pharaoh is moving well shaking offinterference . Hands it off to Becker . Beckerscores on a Ramzey assist ! Jet Yuen puts it home ! Krajenski clocks Ramzey for no reason ! How much can he take ? It looks like you are running out of players . I have not done this in a long time . Wish me luck . A new substitution for the NAA : Obike Fixx , the man who invented Futuresport . - You are getting too old for this . - Let us show them , how we used to do . Jamiston tries to interfere , but he is tripped up by Fixx . Street rules. I invented them . A brutal shot on Jamiston by Obike Fixx . The most blatant foul , I have seen in ten years . - Shame about your boyfriend . - Yes , tragic . Not bad . Have you ever thought about going pro ? - From now on we play a clean game . - l would not have it any other way . Things are heating up . Ramzey is on a mission . Look at his eyes . He is unable to pass . What will he do ? Only the Pharaoh moves like that ! Great block by Fixx . His 5 seconds are up . Can he hang on ? Oh my , what a play ! Tremaine Ramzey ties the score . That was vintage Pharaoh . - How much time left ? - 20 seconds . Good . I cannot take much more . In just seconds we will know Hawaii 's fate . Yuen has the ball . Ramzey intercepts it ! He is airborne ! Ramzey is in trouble . Does he have any moves left ? He scores ! Blake scores ! North America wins ! 43 points for Becker . One ofthe bestperformances ever ! Hey , hot shot . Way to go . Ms. Yuen , the government is disappointed ... - Save it. I played your game . - You lost ! No , you lost ! After all I am a public hero . P.l. rating 205 . You are nobody ! A scapegoat . Enjoy your trip home . Fixx , you are the man ! Thank you. I could not have done it without you . Without me you would not have been in that situation . Judgement call . Training camp starts soon . The L.A. Rush needs a coach . No way , man . Besides , the Rush have a dingy of a coach . - l learned it all from you . - True . Yo , Zee ! - President Clinton is on the line . - Tell Chelsea I will call her back . How did I do ? Not bad for a jock . Tre ... - What does she want ? - l will handle it . - Have you come to see the game ? - l came to see you . And I was not disappointed . Fixx and Blake were the real heroes . Handle things right and nobody will remember them . They will only care about you . is that how you will play it ? I am sorry , I dumped you earlier . I am sure , we can work this out . We would not be having this talk , if I had lost . You cannot blame me for liking winners . And we could be flash together . Yes , we could . But that is not my style anymore . I have moved on to real . Tremaine Ramzey has left the building ! - Nice change of pace . - l am growing up . Welcome to the blast-offclassic between L.A. Rush and Sirocco . With Tre Ramzey as player coach the Rush are entering a new era . What awaits them ? Disappointment or glory ? We will soon see . Because ladies and gentlemen , it is time to play Futuresport !

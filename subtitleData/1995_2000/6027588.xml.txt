 Wow ! That was wild ! Something must be wrong , that was the worst slide I 've ever had ! Yeah , well , I 've had worse . It closed . Yeah , I noticed . Look , did you see Quinn and Maggie go in on the other world ? They were right behind me . I 'm sure they made it ! Okay . Maybe they got separated away from us . That 's happened before . Quinn ! Maggie ! What if they missed the jump ? You got the timer ? No . Quinn 's got it . Q - Ball ! Maggie ! Maggie ! All right . Okay , look . That leaves two choices . Either they got left back there . Which means they 're stuck there for 29 years . Or they got dropped off someplace on this world . I choose the second . Yeah . Let 's see what kind of world this is . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Okay , things seem pretty quiet now . Maybe the explosion was some kind of accident . I don 't know what the devil that was , but it was no accident . Somebody out there is very angry . I can 't believe Quinn and Maggie didn 't make the slide . This isn 't happening to us ! Yeah , well , get used to it . Damn ! Either they missed that slide or they got trapped inside and dropped off at another world or someplace on this one . Q - Ball 's got the timer . And we 're stuck in the middle of somebody else 's war . Is there an upside to this ? Not really . You made it Quinn . Maggie . Maggie . Whoa ! We thought we lost you guys ! It 's good to see you guys , too . But what 's the big deal ? Really . It 's not like we weren 't just with you . Yes , it is . Look , you don 't understand . The vortex is acting weird . It opens . It closed . It opens . It closed . It was filled with turns , drops and electric charges . What are you talking about ? Really , I didn 't see anything like that . The slide seemed perfectly normal . In fact , it was a little more comfortable than usual . No , guys . You don 't understand . There were two different slides . Ours was rough and different . Yours was the same . It was normal . Doesn 't seem to be any malfunction . Yeah . Maybe you guys just hit a detour . You got the high-priced ride . Extra thrills at no extra charge . That ride was no thrill . Yeah , well , that last world we were in was no thrill either . I 'm so glad we 're out of there . Oh , yeah ? You okay ? Those guys were pretty rough . I was holding my own till you got there . You always do . Look , how much time we got on this world ? Twelve hours . What kind of place is this ? You 're not gonna like it . Company move ! Company move ! Go ! What 's going on ? Hey , you people better get off the street . What 's the problem , Lieutenant ? Some B-1 snipers in that tenement . They 've got an anti-tank weapon . We were looking for the Chandler Hotel . Better stay on this side of the street . The Chandler 's clear , last I heard . Hurry . What is it ? I 'm just tired . Lost my voice . When are we gonna slide into a world where nobody 's killing each other ? I don 't know . Uh , we 'd like a suite . 1215 , if available . Damn ! Piece of crap ! You 're joking . I don 't think so . Look , we never joke about hotel suites . We 've got plenty of cash , for a change . All the suites were split up years ago . Nobody could afford them . Gomez ! Yeah . This place has changed since the last time we were here . I 've never seen you here before . Well , you must have something . Some room , somewhere . Anything 's better than a cot in the lobby . You have the Ambassador level . The Deluxe Economy level . Or the Regular Economy . All right . Ambassador . Shoot the moon . Hey , we even have a key to the shower room for the Ambassador . Shower room ? Yeah , unisex . But you can hang up a sign for privacy . We need to fill out a card ? Nah , nah , nah ! Pay in advance . And I don 't care who you are . Hey . Personal Entertainment center ? It 's a wind-up model . Just turn that thing power goes around there . Then , yeah . Works good . Thank you . Yeah . Hi-fi stereo . Uh , Remmy . Why don 't you check this place out ? I 'm gonna get Maggie up to the room so she can lie down . Yeah . Can I get a draft ? We 've got a bullet hole in the satellite dish . But Larry tells me it won 't affect transmission . Did Bernie get through to Dornan ? Look . The story 's one-sided without some kind of comment from the guy . And tell Bernie I want to lead with footage of that B-1 Bobbie on fire . Oh . What can I tell you ? It 's a war . Tough assignment ? Not bad . Nothing like Detroit after the war with Canada . Yeah . Detroit was a mess . You up there ? No , no . Wars and me , we don 't get along . That 's why I try to stay away from it . So what are you doing in this one ? Well , I 'm just passing through . Sort of been out of touch lately . You see , I 'm a marine biologist . I just spent the past year underwater on the coast of Japan . They don 't get CNN in Japan ? Yeah , but it 's in Japanese . You 're a reporter ? Caroline Tatashore . Rembrandt Brown . So maybe you could , uh , bring me up to date about what 's going on around here . Where do you want me to start ? The invasion or the stock market crash that caused it ? The crash ? Yeah , yeah . I heard about that . Just not clear on why . Microsoft went under . Took the whole market down . President of Mexico thought he might have a shot at taking back some land he said we stole . Those guys have been waiting for a shot at us . Marvin , another shooter . Please . Yeah . Make that two . And the Mexican army didn 't know every man , woman and child in the state has an automatic weapon . It 's a law . And they ran into the Willie Nelson Suicide Brigades . Drove them right back across the Rio Grande . Yeah , don 't mess with Texas , huh ? You do pretty good work . Mmm . I 'm a journalist . Since we 're not gonna be here long , and given the gunplay on the streets , it 's probably a good idea for us to lie low right here . Any better ? I 'm not dizzy anymore . I 'm just really tired . Yeah . Me , too . I guess that fight on the last world took more out of me than I thought . I am gonna catch some z 's . Yeah , if I just lie here for a while I 'll be fine . Attention . Attention . New curfew hours have been published for the Nuevo Los Angeles . Due to an increased unrest in the northern San Fernando Valley , all residents must be off the streets at night by 9.00 . Once again , the ELL ruling council has turned down demands for bilingual education in the north Valley schools . " This is a Spanish-speaking " country , " Commissioner Reyes told reporters , " And you Anglos " had better get used to it . " California governor Robert Dornan made a broadcast today . Hey . They sacked out ? Yeah , they both seemed pretty tired . Yeah . Too many worlds at war . It 's bound to wear you down . All right . Look , I 'm beginning to get a take on what happened on this world . I ran into a reporter down at the bar . She was throwing down tequila like they 're running out of cactus . You like Vienna sausage ? Never had it . I better skip that . Anyway , Mexico invaded . All the fighting that 's going on out there in the streets ? Those are guerrillas named B-1 Bobbies . They 're named after the governor . A Robert Dornan . And he 's upstate somewhere underground . And he refuses to let the UN weapons inspectors in . " These beets are chemically preserved " and will retain their wholesome color " long after they are no longer safe to eat . " Oh . So I think it 's best if we stay low until it 's time to slide . Yeah , that 's what Quinn said . Yeah . Whoa ! Tabasco . Better hang onto that . It just might go off . Who the hell is that ? Hey ! What are you doing here ? I think this place is haunted . Again ? I 've checked all over the lobby . I talked to the clerk and to the reporter . No one 's seen a man with that description . Like I said . It could have been a ghost . Yeah , well , I don 't even think about that right now . Look , does 50 bucks for a handful of ice cubes sound right to you ? Quinn and Maggie are running a fever . A fever ? Are they sick ? Looks that way . Wonder how it could 've happened ? I don 't know . It had to be that crazy slide . They were all right until then . It could 've been something to do with that man . Or that ghost . He did something with his hands . What ? Did he come back ? No . But he had some kind of strange presence . I don 't know . It 's hard to explain . Yeah , well , I want to land on a world where everything is easy to explain . No more wars . No more Kromaggs . Just peace and quiet for a change . Go ahead . Go on ahead . Go on ahead . Go on " Go on ahead " . What does he mean ? Go on . Go on ahead . Go on ahead . Go on ahead . Go . Oh ! It 's him ! Hey , farm boy . Come here a minute . Does she look different to you ? She looks ... Yellow . Yeah , I wonder what that means ? I don 't know . In my world , some people looked like that when they were sick . It 's not a good sign . Okay . Look , I don 't like this . They 're gonna need a doctor . I 'm going to see if I can find one . You stay here . Try to keep them comfortable . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Left on attack ! Gotta get that guy some help ! Now ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Gunshot ! I got gunshot here ! Let 's go ! Move ! Move ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! He 's hit ! He 's hit ! The sniper 's down ! The sniper 's down ! Watch for more ! Heads up ! You okay ? Yeah . But why was he shooting at me ? Maybe he thought you were Latin . Maybe it 's just your turn . Okay ! Let 's move it out ! Red Flower . This is Red Flower advance . Sniper rubbed out . Marshall building . Street clear . Hey , look . I need your help . You 've been helped . Yeah . I know that . Thanks . But I 've got friends over here at the hotel who are sick and need a doctor . Yeah , good luck on that . Look , I was told that you people here have medics . Can 't spare any right now . And now for a news update . Sporadic sniper fire continues in Pacoima . But this morning the UN spokesman reported that the area is fully under peacekeeper control after last night 's B-1 Bobbie raids all through the north Valley . California governor Robert Dornan made a broadcast today . Avocados actually got to them instead of being diverted to the Dornan 's inner circle and his ... Okay , Hale . Take the point . Take the point ! Man on the left ! Man on the right ! Move out to the right . Move it on up ! Move it on up ! Turn it . Turn it . Sniper ! You want one ? I owe you . Get me to the doctor and I 'll get you one . Thank God you 're here . I think they 're getting worse . Where 'd you find a doctor ? A friend of his owed me a favor . So can you tell anything , Doc ? In a moment . In a moment . Interesting . Very strange , but interesting . What ? What 's interesting ? Yeah ? What 's very strange ? The yellowish skin is indicative of liver failure . There is edema in the lower extremities , which could indicate congestive heart failure . Then there are the eyes . Well , what about the eyes ? The cloudiness . That 's rather advanced cataracts . What ? What do you mean ? I have never seen anything like this in subjects so young and I cannot be sure without doing some blood work . But , I would have to say that your friends seem to be dying of old age . I 've never seen anything like this . They can 't be dying . They 're still very young . Look , when we got here less than five hours ago they were fine . Now this just came over them . Now , how is that possible ? Were they outside a lot ? No , once we got into the city . We came straight to the hotel . Wait a minute , what 's wrong ? It just occurred to me that this could be the result of some sort of biological weapon . We suspect the guerrillas have them . But they have never been crazy enough to use them . We could all be at risk here . I 'm gonna have to report this to the senior medical staff . We 're gonna have to put your friends in quarantine . Will they get treatment in quarantine ? Yeah , and how long will it take ? You haven 't been listening to me . There is no treatment . Your friends are dying and we have to isolate them to prevent this thing from spreading . We probably won 't know for certain until an autopsy . Mash 105 . This is Kurtz . We have a possible bio-chemical contamination . Chandler Hotel . Code red security . Code red . Wait a minute . What is that ? I told you . Quarantine . No one will be allowed to enter or leave the hotel until the subjects are isolated . Okay , what do we do now ? They 're dying . We 're under armed guard where we cannot move . How long till the slide ? Seven hours . Okay , look . If they get us to a hospital , we 're gonna have to try to stay together . If they try to separate us , like try to put them in some kind of isolation , we won 't be able to take them with us . Then what ? We stay here with them ? For 29 years ? Oh , man , it 's bad , it 's bad . I think I 've figured out a correlation between the appearance of that ghost-like figure and Quinn and Maggie 's condition . What ? What are you talking about ? When I tried to manipulate the coordinating functions , I found some strange read-outs . At first I thought it was caused by something that happened in that rough slide we made . But then I saw that the energy spikes were recorded at the same time that we saw that ghostly image . I can 't read that . What is it you think you 've found ? Somehow I think the appearance of that figure is linked to the energy spikes . Which means I think he 's either somehow linked to the slide or another world . I still don 't see how that could help us . Your friend is quite right . Oh , no . Don 't be frightened . I 'm here to help . Who are you ? Where in the devil did you come from ? I 'm a trans-dimensional traveler . Just like you . It 's not easy to explain what has happened here . I only just figured it out myself . And I 'm sorry that I had to appear so ghost-like before . But I had to make certain that I maintained a link . You know , just an anchor , if you will , to my own world while traveling to this one . All right . During your last trans-dimensional journey ... We call them slides . Oh , I see . All right . During your slide , then , something odd happened in the electron field of your friends physical composition . I knew there was something weird that happened with that . You see , you two weren 't affected . But they were spun off and became the focal point of a kind of bubble universe . But , forgive me if this isn 't quite clear . But I 'm still working out the physics myself . You 're a physicist ? Sorry . Forgot to introduce myself . I 'm Thomas Mallory . Mallory ? On the world I come from , I 'm their son . All right , look , I know this must be a little bit of a shock to you , but look , if you want me to help them , you have to help me . How ? I think I can make the necessary calculations with your equipment . Our equipment ? Your sliding device . Oh . I had a laptop computer in the last world . But a Navajo shaman took it apart . Yeah , well , this will just have to do . Here . The UN soldiers are setting up a perimeter around the hotel . The medic that we had here wants to put Quinn and Maggie into some type of quarantine . Maybe us too . We can 't let that happen . Unless they are reunited with their other selves , they will die . Then we have to get to work . So , a lifetime on your world , if I understand this , is maybe like a dream to this Quinn and this Maggie . That 's an excellent analogy . Your friend 's a philosopher . Sometimes . Hi . Hi . I ... I got this . It 's okay . Shall we go ? My father wants you to come inside so he can meet you . Your father , the general , wants to meet me now ? But we 'll miss the grand march . Oh , come on . Don 't be silly . If he asks you if you 're joining the Service , you tell him the Marines . And if he starts complaining about the Democrats , you just kind of nod , all right ? Oh , you do own a gun , don 't you ? Let 's just enjoy the view for a minute . Why ? Is it going to change soon ? No . No . It 's just that things are moving very fast for us , aren 't they , Maggie ? Do you like the way they 're moving ? I do . I do . Then what difference does it make how fast they move ? This is getting serious , isn 't it , Maggie ? Yes . Does that worry you ? No . No . It scares the hell out of me . Where are we going , Maggie ? Well , it looks to me like we 're going a long way . What does that mean ? Marriage ? House ? Kids ? It usually does . I don 't know if I 'm ready for all that . Well , you don 't get all of it at the same time . In stages . First we get engaged and plan a wedding ... Hey , put the top up . According to Isaac Newton , everything attracts everything else . So how come I 'm only attracted to you ? That 's because Einstein changed all the rules . According to him , space and time are curved near heavy masses . You 're not so heavy . Only on the outside . On the inside I weigh more than 1,000 suns . So do you . Do you want children ? Of course . Don 't you ? We need some time to ourselves first . Don 't you think ? I mean , I gotta finish grad school and then I want to get hooked up with a good research department somewhere . What ? Now you want to teach ? Last summer , when you had Doctor Feynman , you wanted to do pure research . I 've never heard you so excited about anything . Feynman had that effect on us . And if I could get a job at Caltech , I could do both . A boy . What ? You were thinking , " I wonder if she wants a boy or a girl . " How did you know that ? I don 't know . Maybe it has something to do with your " heavy mass " and my " curved space " . So now you can read my mind ? Sometimes . Okay , where do I want to go tonight ? Um , you want to go to that place by that thing that you like . Underneath the ... Behind the ... Yeah . We always talk about what I want to do . What do you want to do ? Fly like a bird . Mom became a pilot . Our Maggie was a pilot , too . Combat with the Marines . You know , there is no your Maggie or my Maggie . They 're not duplicates . They are themselves . Only split off . I think the world that Maggie and Quinn created was in response to some deep longing , maybe a need for peace . A way out of harsh , real worlds like this . You mean , you can wish a whole world into being ? Why not ? Well , no sign of an ambulance or a hazmat team yet . Maybe this air raid is holding them up . You know , Dad used to talk about you a lot . You know , you 're my uncle . I hadn 't really thought about that . Good luck ! Bye ! They , look beautiful ! Yeah ! Bye-bye ! They were supposed to honeymoon for a week in Bermuda . But they came home after a couple days . Dad had got an idea for a new formula for relativistic energy and needed his computer . I don 't want you to get the idea that Dad neglected Mom for his work . She was very happy . So was I when I came along . Oh ! They named me Thomas Michael . Thomas for the general , Michael for my father 's dad . Your dad . Hey , come here . Come here come here . Come here . I think I was a year and a half when dad started planning my NFL career . Good one . He 's such a smart guy . Whoa ! Whoa ! Yeah ! It seemed like only an instant . In a way , it was . Till I had my PhD in physics , just like Dad . Of course . No one could ever be " just like Dad " . He was one of a kind . After I left home , I always wrote Mom and Dad so they could keep up with my work . I got a great job in biophysics at the South Pole . At least I thought it was a great job . A lot of my colleagues complained about the weather . Mom and Dad were always very much in love with each other that never wavered . And now , that life is almost over . I think I 've got it . You were right about this complex conjugate . It folds right back into this other data . Of course , there 's a problem . I knew there would be . Can 't be helped . What ? What problem ? The only way to save our Quinn and Maggie is to reunite them with their other halves . You see , these are the real Quinn and Maggie . The bubble universe where I was born and grew up isn 't real . Not in a material sense . By reuniting the two entities , your friends will be regenerated , the life drain will stop , and they will live . Of course , it 's just a theory . Yeah , but a good one . I like it . Now , will it work ? If it does , there 'll be a terrible price . If it works , the bubble universe and everything in it will cease to exist . Including you ? Yeah , well , we 'd better do something . The medical team is already here . Looks like they 're suiting up for germ warfare . They 're not taking any chances . My parents had a rich and full life . Lives that Maggie and Quinn would have wished for . But now , it 's time to break the link . And let your friends return to this life . What about you ? Without your friends , my parents and their world would never have existed . Without my parents , I wouldn 't have existed . Look , how close are you guys ? Look , I 'm gonna need a second . I just want a few minutes of your time . Look , not right now . Look , just a statement . Look , we know that the guerrillas are using biological warfare and we think that your friends are involved . Look , no comment . Look , the UN has sealed off the hotel and the medical hazmat team is coming up . I just want the story . Look , there is no story . Someone is over-reacting . In a few minutes , the military police are going to get your sick friends to a sealed biomedical lab . And everybody else in this room is going to be arrested . Don 't you want to get your story out there ? He said no comment ! All right . If our numbers are right , and I programmed the right coordinate , I 'm ready to transport me and your friends back to my world . Can you take us with you ? Yes , but it 's dangerous . Look , Rembrandt ... You never existed on the bubble world and your presence there now might upset the whole process . You might even be eliminated along with that world . What about Quinn and Maggie ? What would happen to them ? They 'll return here because in reality , they never left . But they would still live ? That 's the theory . All right , military police . Everybody , clear out ! Okay . Look , if we go with you we 're not sure what 's gonna happen . Let 's move it ! Everybody . Clear out ! Right now ! If we stay here , we do know what 's gonna happen . It 's not an easy selection . Open the door this is the military police . We can 't let them die ! Open the door ! This is the military police ! We 're gonna count to three and we 're gonna knock this door down . One ! Here goes ... Two ! Everything . Three ! Dad . Mom . You made it . I knew they would . I knew Thomas would find a way . You were always a bright boy . You look just as I remembered . Maybe even a little better . Tsk , behave yourself , Quinn . A little dignity , please ! I 've always had a little dignity , my dear . Just enough to get by . Who are they ? Uh , Dad ... Friends . This is Rembrandt Brown and Dad , this is Uncle Colin , your brother . This is more than I could have hoped . Will the fabric of this cosmos handle the extra mass ? I haven 't had time to refine the calculations . They 're taking a great risk . You were always like that . I don 't know what to say . I do . Thank you . You gave us a wonderful life . And because we lived it , so , in a way , did you . And you 'll remember . But now , it 's over . Everyone who 's ever lived has known from the beginning that there would be an end . And some of us still wouldn 't believe it . It must be very strange to see your future . Yes . But not at all troubling . I don 't know . I feel , um , at peace , somehow . Good . And you mustn 't feel at all bad about what is to happen . We have lived long and well . Worked hard . Had more than our share of good times , too . And a loving son . Perhaps the memory of all that we have had will keep you strong . In the hard times you have ahead of you . I think it will . " I have been here before " " When and how I cannot tell " Dante Gabriel Rossetti . You do know him , don 't you ? I probably should . Physics major . I don 't know what 's happening with students today . Physics majors should know as much about Keats and Tennyson and Rossetti as they do about M-theory . You do know M-theory , don 't you ? Yes , sir . It 's ... Stop lecturing the boy , Quinn ! Occupational hazard . Oh , I know . Well , Mags , are you ready ? Yes . Thomas , for this sacrifice , there is no way we can thank you . And no need . Colin . Rembrandt . You may have given your life for your friends . We know . Put your hands on top of ours . Say it , Thomas . You know the part we like . " I have been here before " But when and how I cannot tell " I know the grass beyond the door " The sweet keen smell " " The sighing sound The lights around the shore " " And you have been mine before " How long ago I may not know " Has this been thus before ? " And shall not thus time 's eddying flight " Still with our lives our love restore ? " In death 's despite " And day and night " " yield one delight " " once more ? " Well , we made it . We 're back . Yeah , but back where ? You all right ? Yeah , I feel fine . Me , too . Do you remember ? Everything . How can I have a lifetime of memories and haven 't even lived mine yet ? I don 't know . But I want to hold onto every one . And make some new ones . Does any of this seem at all familiar ? How much time do we have here ? Twelve hours . We 're right back where we started . The poem Thomas read , " I 've been here before But when or how I cannot tell " But , how ? The space-time of the bubble universe was destroyed . That space and that time never existed . Except for in our memories . What 's going on ? Hey , you people better get off the street . What 's the problem , Lieutenant ? Some B-1 snipers up in that tenement . They 've got an anti-tank weapon . We were looking for the Chandler Hotel . The Chandler 's clear , last I heard . Better stay on this side of the street . Yeah , we know . By the way , Lieutenant , be very careful today . Keep a sharp eye out over the rooftops ! I think we 've reached the beginning . Come on , let 's go !

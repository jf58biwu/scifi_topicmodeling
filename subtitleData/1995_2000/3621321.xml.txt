 Hello ? Hello ? Hey ! I 'm sittin ' here , dude ! Sorry , we 're closed . I was here before you turned off the light . Grandfather clause , man . - l need a super patty double with cheese . - The light was a mistake . We 're closed . - Sorry . - The light was on ! How bad do you want this job , cos l 'll call the head office right now ? Super patty , double , with cheese . Supersize fries , supersize Diet Sprite . Drive through , please . What the hell is this ? Customer service , man . Stop spanking ' and get my food ! Hey , in there . Guy ? You are your own man , and you control everything you do . - Hey , yo , Derwood . - Hey , Rob . - Hey , Mr Rice . - How 's it goin ' , Rob ? - Have a good one , Lucy . - You too , Rob . Welcome to Lucky Boy . May I take your order ? - We 'll have it our way . - fbi . Special Agents Scully and Mulder . - We 'd like a word with your manager , please . - That 's me . How can I help you ? Sir , would you do us a favor and gather your employees ? - What 's going on ? - We 're investigating a murder . A car was found ten miles from here . A body was found in the trunk of that car . - What does that have to do with us ? - This was also found in the car . It 's a badge that 's only given to employees , is that correct ? " Free fer Fridays . " lt 's our promotion where you buy one super patty and get one free . But look , there 's four Lucky Boys in Costa Mesa alone and 30 in Orange County . - 32 . - Long day , so let 's make this quick . - Does everybody have their button ? - We only wear them on Fridays . Free fer Fridays . Yeah , but does everybody have their button ? Hey , you , back there . What 's your name ? - Derwood Spinks . - Do you have your button , Derwood ? No. I must have left it at home on account of we 're supposed to only wear ' em on Fridays . I sure as hell didn 't leave it on no dead guy . I don 't believe that we said the victim was male . We 're gonna ask everybody to step outside while we take a quick look around . Who was the victim ? His name was Donald Edward Pankow . - Does that ring a bell ? - No . I 'll get some cigarettes . I 'd better call the corporate headquarters . Find out what they want us to do . Hey , Scully , check it out . You know how they say you never wanna see the kitchen of your favorite restaurants ? Somehow I don 't think Lucky Boy would make that list . My point being that this is a hell of a lot cleaner than all the others . - Don 't you think ? - l guess . So what are you saying ? This place has been scrubbed to cover up evidence ? Maybe . Maybe I 'm thinking this was the crime scene . So Mr Pankow had his brain neatly removed from his skull here in this kitchen ? - Had to happen somewhere . - But next to the shake machine , Mulder ? I think we should check out lockers , not entertain the idea that ad hoc surgery was performed here . I wouldn 't exactly call it surgery . What if this man 's brain was eaten ? It 's not sociologically unheard of . There are tribes in New Guinea that consider brains a delicacy . - Yeah , but , Mulder , we 're in Orange County . - Yeah , what 's your point ? It 's just that nothing suggests a fetishistic killing . The brain wasn 't removed intact . What if his brain was eaten out of his skull ? Through a small opening that looks like it was cut with a hole saw ? Maybe it was cut . Maybe it was punched . What look like tool marks to you look to me more organic . Like it was made by a tongue or a proboscis . The proboscis of what ? I don 't know . Hello . Look at this . Does that look like blood to you ? Yes , looks like it . What is that ? Next to it. ls that ... ? Oh , my God. ls that ... is that brain matter ? There ? No , I 'd say that 's ground beef . - Ground beef ? - Yeah . Rob Roberts ? It 's Agent Mulder . - Hello again . Sorry to bother you at home . - No , no bother . - Yeah , can I come in ? - Yeah , sure , sure . - What can I do for you ? - Live here alone ? - Yeah , it 's just me . - Mom or girlfriend ? - What ? - Come on , man , who cleans up after you ? Neither. lt 's just me. I live here alone . Bravo . They say single guys are just bears who own furniture . But I mean , my place ? But here , you can smell the Pine-Sol . Thanks . Can I get you anything ? Yeah , a cheeseburger and a large order of fries . It 's a bad joke. I 'm sorry . Mr Rice , your manager , he told me that you stayed late on Friday . - ls that right ? - Yeah , sure , Friday . The freezer had died on us. I stayed after to throw out the meat that was goin ' bad . Yeah , did you volunteer to close ? - Yeah . - Yeah , OK . You volunteered . Volunteered . The 35 pounds of ground chuck that Mr Rice told you to throw away , - what did you do with that ? - l threw it out . - Where ? - ln the dumpster behind the restaurant . That 's weird . That 's what I figured you did , so I checked and it was empty . It 's weird. lt only gets cleaned out on Thursday , and you 'd have thrown away the meat on Friday , so you 'd expect the meat to be there . I don 't see how that 's relevant to this murder case anyway . Let me see if there 's anything else I wanted to ask you . Blood . You 're bleeding . I bit my lip . I think thatjust about wraps it up for me here . Hey , I hope you catch the guy . Yeah . No , I already got a pretty good idea who it is . Thanks . What do you want ? - Nothing . - So take a hike . Hi . This is a message for Rob Roberts . My name is Dr Mindy Reinhart , and I 'm a licensed mental-health counselor with the Lucky Boy corporation 's employee assistance program . I 'm talking to all of the employees about the recent unpleasantness that occurred there . Rob , I 'd love for you to come down to my office at 11am tomorrow morning . As it is a requirement of your employer 's insurance provider , this meeting is mandatory . I 'm in the Irvine Medical Park . Suite 308 . Have a good evening . Self-discipline . That 's the name of this game . That 's the one thing that separates us from the animals , provided you have it . But where do you get it ? You can 't go down to the local store and buy self-discipline . You can 't order it over the Internet , so where does it come from ? I used to weigh 356 pounds . Do you believe that ? It 's true . I lived to eat , ladies and gentlemen . My entire life revolved around eating because I was always hungry . My appetite was controlling me . Four-star restaurants , Denny 's ... it didn 't stop . It didn 't stop until I took charge of my own life , until I put on the brakes and said " Whoa ! " " Ricardo , you are your own man and you control everything that you do . " Oh , brother . What ? Derwood , how did you get in here ? Just a little skill I picked up in Chino . I did a nickel for attempted murder . You didn 't know I was an ex-con ? Yeah , nobody at work did . Not until this fbi murder investigation whipped everybody up into a froth . Derwood , what can I do for you ? You know I got fired last night ? Stupid little pissantjob , where they make you wear a paper hat - and they fired me . Plus , as far as that red-headed fbi agent 's concerned , I 'm the prime suspect in this murder . But that 's no skin off my nose , seeing as you did it . Diet pills . Yours , right ? I found ' em when I opened up on Saturday morning . I didn 't give ' em back because I figured " free speed , " right ? But then there 's this whole flap about a murder . And I noticed this . That ain 't ketchup , man . What do you want , Derwood ? I don 't know . What have you got ? TV , VCR . Ah , it 's all crappy , off-brand stuff , but I 'll take that , and whatever money you got in the bank . And you get this . And I keep my mouth shut and just maybe you can blow town before the long arm of the law reaches out and grabs you by the gonads . Maybe not . Cup ' em . Hi , Rob. I hate to bother you , but , last night , there was a man in a parked car for hours . Did you happen to see him ? A maroon car . He was clean-cut , so I didn 't call the police , but he was still there when I went to bed . Gee , Sylvia , I don 't know what to tell you . He 's gone now , butjust keep your eyes out in case he comes back . - You got it . - Thanks . So I 'll call you tonight , let you know where to drop off my new VCR . Oh , and don 't try skipping town . You won 't get too far . Hey , just the man I wanted to see . - How are you this morning , Rob ? - Fine . Glad I caught you . I was just driving to your apartment and I saw Derwood Spinks not a block from here . - He wasn 't comin ' from your place , was he ? - No , I haven 't seen him . Good. I 'd stay away from him . He 's our prime suspect in the Pankow murder . - You think he did it ? - Me ? No . No , no. I should say that 's the opinion of the Costa Mesa police , and my partner . - So , he 's not your guy ? - No . No , I think we 're lookin ' for somebody who has a compulsion to kill . Can 't help himself . Quick question . The meat that you threw in the dumpster ... - What about it ? - The dumpster had a padlock ? - Yeah . - Who would have the key ? We do , and the trucking company does . Hey , wait . What 's your point ? I 'm just tying ' up some loose ends . Good . You got my message . I appreciate your coming . This will be really informal . Here you go . I wanna run through some things with you . We don 't stand on ceremony , so if there is anything you wanna talk about , just go ahead and blurt it out , OK ? - lt hasn 't been a run-of-the-mill week so far . - No . The police have been at the restaurant , the fbi ... I 'm sure this has been a very stressful time for you . Pretty much . So we wanna keep on top of any problems that these stresses might cause for you . So let 's run through some standard questions together . Rob , have you been troubled recently by insomnia ? Bad dreams or nightmares ? Have you felt emotionally numb ? Do you ever see things that aren 't there or hear voices ? - Tell me , Rob . Do you feel ... ? - This ... this murder . - This murder that happened ... - Yes ? What kind of a monster would do something like that ? I don 't believe in monsters . But I do believe in people . And sometimes they do terrible things out of weakness , or sickness , or fear . But I do truly believe that deep down inside , even the worst of us wants to be good . Rob , is there anything that 's troubling you that you 'd like to talk about ? I 'm sorry. I thought I 'd put that on voice mail . Mindy Reinhart . Yes , Agent Mulder , what can I do for you ? No , I 'm afraid I can 't do that . I 'm sorry , but it would violate patient confidentiality . - l ... - Excuse me , Agent . - Rob ? - Yeah ? I have to go to work now . Would you please call me later so that we could finish our talk ? You shouldn 't be here , Derwood . We 'd have mailed your last check . Just give me my money , Rice . How you doin ' , killer ? You better have some money for me too . There . Now please leave . With pleasure , pal . I oughtajust make happy hour . Since this is farewell , when nobody was looking , I used to dip my boys in the coleslaw . Bon appétit . If somebody 's still in here , you 're in a world of hurt . Rob ? You lookin ' for these ? Deal 's off , buddy . You know that guy you iced , Pankow ? I just heard he didn 't have a brain in his head . You 're one sick little freak , man . You got a lotta problems . If I were the fbi , I 'd want you real bad . Public enemy number one , and all that . Lots of reward money . So I 'm gonna turn you in myself . Lucky boy . - Rob . - Hi . - You said we should finish talking . - Come in . - l think I need help . - Tell me why you think that . I have compulsions to eat. I get hungry . And I try to put it off for as long as I can , but then , finally , I just get so hungry that I can 't help myself , and ... You binge , then purge ? You eat too much and then cause yourself to vomit ? No. I just eat . But this makes you feel bad . I guess it makes me feel like I 'm not a good person . There are many different kinds of eating disorders . People from every walk of life suffer from them . But if there 's one thing that they all have in common , it 's low self-esteem . And it 's a shame , because low self-esteem can be like a fun-house mirror . It reflects back a warped and ugly image of ourselves . What do you think Cindy Crawford would look like in a fun-house mirror ? Weird ? Ugly . And how would the most handsome man in the world look ? How would Peter Jennings look in a fun-house mirror ? - Ugly . - And how do you look in this mirror ? Do you think that looks like a bad person , an unworthy person ? I 'll tell you what I see . I see a nice smile . I see soulful brown eyes. I see good . Now , Rob , I want you to keep looking into this mirror until you see the same things I do . There 's a meeting I 'd like you to attend . It 's every Monday , Wednesday and Friday . You can talk to me anytime , but these people are the best . They can really help you . - l have to go . - You always hurry away . I appreciate it . And I want you to understand that I really am trying to do right . Rob , you didn 't tell me you had a friend in the fbi . He 's upstairs. I told him all about that strange man in the maroon car . And he said he 'd look into it . Afternoon , Rob . Sir , may we speak with you ? - Derwood Spinks has disappeared . - His car has gone along with his belongings . My partner saw Spinks in your neighborhood yesterday morning . At that time , you told Agent Mulder that you hadn 't seen Mr Spinks. ls that correct ? I don 't even know him that well . If he was going to leave town , he wouldn 't tell me about it . Who said he left town ? I don 't know . - lsn 't that what you think happened ? - No , no . Personally , I think he 's dead . I can 't speak for my partner . But I think that whatever it was that killed Donald Pankow also got to Derwood Spinks . What do you mean , whatever " it " was ? I 'll let you in on a little secret . We 've been able to keep it pretty quiet up until now , but Donald Pankow 's brain was missing from his skull . My partner found something previously undetected . It was the tip of what can only be described as a tiny shark 's tooth embedded deep in the bone . I think we 're looking for a genetic freak . A carnivorous predator as yet unidentified . A monster , if you will . - There 's no such thing . - Don 't you believe it . This thing qualifies . It has a biological imperative to eat. I think it ate that ground chuck you threw away . Yeah ? Why ? Because it can 't kill with impunity , and it knows it . It knows that the more it feeds on humans , the closer it gets to getting caught . But the hunger is always there . And it satisfies it any way it can . I 'm sorry , but this is like good cop ... insane cop . Why are you telling me all of this ? I think you know why . Thank you , Mr Roberts . We 'll contact you if we have any further questions . Watch out for that monster . Devil 's food , with the white , sugar frosting . It is like " Deliver me from evil . " Come on in . Come on . So I baked three dozen of these for my daughter 's school fundraiser . And at three in the morning , the night before , there they are , all three dozen of them , lined up and calling to me . Small world . - ls this your first time at a meeting ? - Yeah . Does anybody else have anything they wanna share ? Do you feel up to introducing yourself ? Everybody 's really nice . Don 't be scared. lt helped me . Hi . My name is Robert Roberts . - People call me Rob . - Hi , Rob . I have an eating disorder. I 'm definitely a meat-eater , not a vegetarian . I 've always had these cravings . My whole life . And just recently , the last month or so , they 've just become too powerful to resist . - Tell us about it . - l guess it 's the taste I respond to the most . Salty and juicy . Kind of buttery . The texture of it , inside of your mouth . You know , your teeth just sink into it like this juicy cloud . And it tastes so good . You don 't even wanna swallow it . You just wanna work it around your taste buds until your eyes roll right back into your head . Do you remember when I first came here ? Anyway , it 's a real problem . Wait , your ex-husband did what ? He said I was too fat to ride in his sports car - that I 'd just mess up the springs . So , I sat on the hood and I bounced . And I didn 't stop until the police showed up . They sided with me . Thank you , Sylvia . Good night , Rob . Good night , Sylvia . I 'll be right there . What the hell is goin ' on ? Oh , my God ! Call the police ! Everything OK ? Mr Derwood Spinks , alive and well ? I 'm confused , Rob . Was he helping you redecorate ? - l lied to you before . - About what ? Derwood was coming from my place the morning you saw him . He said if I spoke to you , he 'd kill me . What didn 't he want you to tell us ? Last Friday night , he hung out while I was cleaning out the freezer . He told me to go home . Said he 'd finish up . I didn 't know why the hell he was being so nice to me , but when I got home , I realized I had the key to the dumpster . And when I drove back , - l saw him cleaning up all this blood . - You must have been very scared . I was , but , you know , I should have told the truth from the start . Do you recognize this guy ? - No . - He 's a private eye . Sylvia Jassie 's ex-husband hired him to spy on her . But now this Steve Kiziak has gone missing . He was last seen parked outside your apartment . - You didn 't notice him ? - No , I didn 't notice anything . - Maybe we should check with Sylvia again . - l don 't think she 's home . Well , we 'll track her down . Don 't worry , Rob. lt won 't be long now . Oh , my God . Rob ? What happened ? It 's a long story . What do you want ? I was in the neighborhood , and I thought I 'd say hi . Hi . Rob , are you all right ? Did you do this ? No . Derwood Spinks did this . You know , he 's the one who ... Like I said , it 's a long story . - Where are you going ? - To a friend 's house . I have to leave , actually , as in , now . - Are you sure you 're all right ? - Yes , absolutely. I 'm fine , you know . It 's just that I sensed that there were things that you wanted to talk about , but couldn 't . That was yesterday . - Well , can we talk about them now ? - Look , let me stop you right there , OK ? You don 't have to worry about me anymore . As of 10 : 38am I am no longer employed by the Lucky Boy corporation . - l quit . - Rob , I 'm here as a friend . Well , then , consider me cured . - l had a breakthrough last night . - Did you attend the OA meeting ? - Yeah . - How did it go ? It was a complete and utter waste of my time . - l 'm sorry you felt that way . - So they 're a bunch of fat people . So what ? Maybe they 've got what you would call a biological imperative to eat too much . Did you ever think of that ? Did you ? You know , maybe I 've got a biological imperative too . So why is that such a bad thing ? Like the world 's gonna end ? That is biology . You can 't fight biology . You can 't . - Sounds like you 're tired of feeling guilty . - Bingo . I am sick and tired of pretending that I 'm something that I 'm not . You killed that man , didn 't you ? What did you just say ? That 's why you feel so guilty , isn 't it ? Can you tell me why you did it ? Who have you been talking to ? No one. I realized it after our last session . - You spoke to the fbi , didn 't you ? - l haven 't spoken to anyone . And I won 't without your permission , but I am here to ask you to turn yourself in . I want you to get the help that you need . You don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . - Yes , I do , Rob . - No , you don 't ! You said you don 't believe in monsters . Right ? How about now ? How about ... now ? Do you believe in monsters ? You poor man . What you must go through . - Oh , my God . - Step away , Rob . - Step away . - Dr Reinhart , step away from him . Rob , we tracked Sylvia down on the way to the landfill . You just can 't stop yourself , can you ? Get on the floor . Rob , get on the floor . Rob . Be that good person I know you mean to be . Why ? I can 't be something I 'm not . Visiontext Subtitles : Marisa Castle de Joncaire US english

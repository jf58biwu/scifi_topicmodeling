What is it , Eddie ? You think I 'm crazy ? One thing I know for sure , with or without quatrain , you need help . Nightmares are not random , Cade . They are triggered by traumatic events of our lives , that we can not face . I know the theory . I read a few books . And I , your reports mainly . Gua , Mabus , alien experiments . It 's as though Trauma should be your middle name . What caused this nightmare ? The answer is inside a 12 year old boy . Poth confrunþi to you again ? No , but what alternative do I have ? Cade , you 're in your house . Your mother is with you . E immediately after your anniversary of 12 years . Blackhawks . - Blackhawks ? A stadium ? - Where you could see a playoff game ? - Is it really true ? - How can , buddy . With Leafs Blackhawks . November 3rd . - Things will get better , Cade . - What do you say ? - Do you want to go ? - Must ! Mom . We have to go , Mom . We have to go ! We have to go ! What happens ? Not sure , but these values ​ ​ are high . View this wave ? It indicates that creatively uses their memory . What do you want to say ? Invent a memory ? The mind can create walls , false memories to hide the painful truth . Now it seems he hit one of the walls . - We must extract it . - No waiting . The values ​ ​ are again stable . I think he went through . - What you did ? - Nothing . It just happened . We have to go . Cade , you can not come with me to the hospital . Just some tests . I 'll be back in two days . I do not want to come back here , ever . Not while he 's here . I am sorry . Îþi harm . It 's a jerk ! Cade not say that . Ned 's not a good father to you , I know that . I would like to can change things , but I can not . But now you need to be strong . We must stand together . Promise me you 're staying until I get back . Good . - Where are you going ? Give me that . - It is mine . Listen , asshole , here anything that is not yours . Do you understand ? - You 're just a burden . A zero . - You 're drunk . Go ahead . It 's true ! Yeah , maybe I drink too much . And why ? The values ​ ​ are again high . - Something big . - Another false memory ? Whatever it scares him to death . Maybe it 's nightmare . - The East . - ªtiu . - Cine sunt ei ? - E doctor , bãiete . Dr Rook . - It 's my mom ? - Not such a doctor , They are more of a scientist , actually . - Well ? - Yes , it will do well . - What are they ? - I 'm on his side . You have your earn a living , boy . What are you doing ? - Did you bring some money home . - Let me go . But one day , right ? His mother returns tomorrow . - We will finish one day . - What 's over ? Let me go . Falls ! - What happened ? - Did it . The bastard has done it ! Their bastard sold me . You sold ? Who ? La Cave . I searched from 1982 to 1986 . There is no informed about Dr. Rook , the universities of Chicago nor in the country . But ask me about missing children . But missing children ? That 's a lot . All of Chicago . - Most appeared after a day or two . - In Life ? If one may say so . Some psychiatric hospitals filled , others committed suicide ... None and remembered what happened . Wait . You say you 've been in them ? Mie mi se pare evident , Foster . Think about Eddie . Gua took me two years ago . Hundreds of children disappears with you , Foster . All 12 years old , all orphans from all their father died in the war . Gua experimented on children , Cade . You must have been a topic . - How I could forget something like that ? - Maybe not . Perhaps logged in memories were blocked by advanced techniques . No matter how bad was my childhood , at least I had . Now I find that my Gua took . - And then I was in the mind . - But why ? What did they want from you ? Whatever it is , it 's quatrain . That means the second wave . Mulþumesc , Eddie . Send me again . We 'll do it gradually . Cade , I go back before the abduction . You and Ned . Where did you get it ? From hand luggage . I think you stole again . Do you think it opens Poth ? No . How did you do that ? Find out for yourself . Uºurel . It 's like music . Some people feel it , others do not . The world is full of secrets , puºtiule . If a feel , Poth get anywhere . - It 's locked . - No locked puºtiule . If you hit something , continues . There is always a way . You did it . Hell , puºtiule , you senses . No stress . These values ​ ​ indicate a pleasant memory . There 's not much of that . Too bad that can not remain so for a while . No time . We must go deeper . Why the rush ? The sooner we get there , the sooner we will know the truth , that 's what you want , is not it ? Go ahead . Cade , now bring you before . - Rummage , motherfucker ! - Where 's you ? - That 's not your job . - You stole . Ned , what happens ? If Mom finds out , îþi gives shoes . If your mother was , he would kill her . You know how sick he is . Do you want to die ? Want this ? Down ? That 's right , dear . We are talking about a game . Is not it , boys ? Cade ? - Safe . Sunday 's game . It 's good , Rose . Get back in bed . Go and you odihneºte . Puºti încãpãþânat . I earn money . Cum ? Not like believing you . But if you tell your mother about this , next time ... will be twofold . You know what to do . Liniºteºte-you , Cade . Why have you brought ? I was so close . I did not us . Every time you approach the target memory you beat a blockade . False memories , physical side . I take away the truth . You must be a way through . There is a chance . There should be gradual . Try to go directly to repressed memories . - And all bypass blockages ? - Theoretically , yes . Cade , we do not know what you expect . It 's too risky . If you do not , I 'll never know what I have done And this is the biggest nightmare . Put me in the white room . Get me out of here . Help . Let me go ! Stop it ! I thought you said override jams . Yes . It must be caught in their memories , and the entrance has triggered . - I thought this would happen . - You knew that he entered a minefield ? - Why did not you warn me ? - Because you have to get there . Foster was right . We have no choice . Come on , young man . Ready to play . Thi favorite food I cooked . Whatever happens , we will never forget this . - Cade , what is it ? - There 's something wrong . Cade , honey , there 's nothing wrong . It is perfect . I know , but ... this happened . Cade , please do not ruin everything . No . No , this happened . No it happened . No ! No ! No it happened . Cade , what are you doing here ? You should see me so . - You have to die ? - And if you do not leave . Get out and I 'll be fine . I can not . They must remain . Do not do this to me , Cade . Do not kill me . Sorry , I can not leave . Why do you want to kill me , Cade ? Why ! ? Why do you want to kill me ! ? Why ! ? - No no ! - Why ? Cade Foster , are prepared to begin ? Are not you doctor ! I scratched your friend . His blood suddenly disappeared . 're Not even human ! I am impressed ... And since 're so perceptive ... - You do not like what you see ? - I will find someone here - And tell him all about you . - No , you will not . Do not have your 'll remember anything , and if you try ... Say ... will be bad for your heart . Greer 's heart . It 's in cardiac arrest ! God ! It 's not breathing ! Come fall . Come on ! - He 's back . - Get him until he stops the heart . - Wait , Jordan , passed what 's worse . - Do it ! Sinazine , should wake him . Nothing happens . I think he 's still in deep sleep . Do something , Greer . I can not ! We have no control over this regression , Jordan . - No longer in our hands . - When she wakes up ? - When ? - Perhaps never . Why did you bring me here ? What do you want ? There are some obstacles to conquer this world . I think the biggest one is " the chosen one " mentioned in an ancient prophecy . Savior of mankind , " twice blessed man . " It 's crazy . I 'm not the savior . My leaders agree . They say that all people are weak , the prophecy itself means nothing . Let them prove they are deceiving , yes ? Why me ? There must be and others . Many . They populate shelters , long time from now on . There 'll beat me . Exactly the attitude I expect , but elected or not , Cade Foster , I will beat you . Prins ? They have a kind of a minefield Gua medium in Foster 's head ? And we 've sent that minefield , Eddie . - You saved his life and at the same time . - Great . You can thank , if he ever wakes up . Eddie , I convinced him to do that . One thing I know about Cade Foster , nobody can force . Moreover , I found that quatrain . If anyone is guilty , I am . You may be right . Have you checked this Sinazine ? Yes , no one has heard of him . - Jordan , how much confidence you have in Greer ? - It 's over a year Raven Nation . Maybe it 's just paranoia , but I have a funny feeling about it . - This feeling ? - From Teama . Hurts , does not it ? Yes , it hurts ! Annoys you , right ? It makes hates . I know everything about your life . How your father died in the war . - He was a hero ! - Sea Hero . He left for me . I drink , lie , îþi hurt ... The worst is that I hurt your mother and you did nothing to me stops . - Shut up ! It 's sick . - Cancer ? It must hurt like hell . If I lived or pay for treatment if you have done something . - I hate you . I hate you ! - How much , Cade ? Wanna stops the pain ? It 's simple . All you have to do is shoot . Shoot ! I know that you want . Shoot ! No . I will not kill anyone . Not for you . We 'll see . - Greer , what 's this ? - Measures brain waves . I know that . I mean that . Another model of brain waves ? - How is it possible ? - It could be a fault . I do not think so . I think the only fault here , you 're . - Listen , Jordan ... - This Sinazine there , right ? - Ce i-ai dat ? - Hypnotic . A sedative . You pushed and deeper . - Traitor . You bastard ! - I did it to save him . Who do you work ? Mabus ? Or he sent to check that little experiment . A check of the subject 117 ? - No , not that . - Then what is it ? If I were awakened him Foster would have disturbed the process . - What process ? - You do not understand , please ... Please , you have to trust me . Nu , n-o voi face . I do not know who they were . I know only that they took my son . Sorry , Rose , We know that university tests were not performed on boys his age . God ! You 're absolutely sure ? Therefore for some time , similar cases in Chicago . All the boys are the same age as Cade I could tell similar training . Please , you must do something to find it . Believe me , Rose . Nothing is more important for me than to have your son reside . Nothing . - Îþi some more coffee . - Thank you . I know that are there . You wait . You wonder how it is possible to know that this happened . After all , you were never here and Rose never told not logged in . I 'm here because we have broken the rules . - You created this memory ? - Yes . For when you needed it the most . And you 'll need it . Who you are ? I know what you 're thinking , but no , not you . But how ... In this memory I took the known Thiele front ... yours . Who you are ? What do you want ? Soon you knows the answers . When prophecy and destiny intersect , I 'll be there in my true form . Someone wants to see you . I think you know who . Excuse me , you talk to someone ? We are absolutely alone , Rose . Tell me about your son . Tell me about Cade . Jordan , I want as much as you like Foster , you reuºeascã , believe me . I saw people linguºitori at Gua , killing and friends , parents . How do I know if someone has not come to you ? Maybe someone did , but who or what you think . No more mysteries . - Tell me how to get him out of there . - We can not . Like I said , this is no longer in our hands . What happens , Greer ? I 'm not sure , I think there are two consciousness . You think it 's someone else 's mind Foster ? Who ? I honestly do not know , but I know that the mind can accommodate a single consciousness . Council does not approve of your actions . They want serious data on human subjects . I do not understand that they offer more ? I give them victory over men . Following a mystical prophecy ? Gua fate of all existence depends on a child 12 years ? Not every child , but the son of a great warrior dead in a large city on the lake . A selfless a man with instinct really , who will do what 's right for humanity , regardless of the consequences . He exists . Council says that you have to wait a little longer . Let them know . You must return all results . The experiment ended . I cant do this . I 'm so close . This topic may be the one for him . No longer is your choice , Rook . Council can not be defied . Me neither . - Cade ? - Who 's there ? Pothos not see me . Hear me out . These are all tests ... Poth win . - I can not . - Trust me , you 'll fails . - Because you know something . - What ? What do I know ? Truth . What truth ? A profound question for bãieþel . To find the answer ? Mama . Mom ? You can not hear . Wait . What the hell is this ? Nine years And yet you whine after this bastard ? - Ned , please , do not feel good . - Always 're sick ! No one believed we could have much better than you ? Not in front of Cade . Why not ? Why not look bastard ? N-o atinge ! Get out of here , boy ! Leave her alone ! Suddenly you matured ? Help me , Cade . Make him stop . - Cade , make him stop . - What do you , punk ? - Do you think that one can protect it ? - Leave her alone . Let us tell you something ... When I 'm done with you , you will regret that you was born . It falls ... Tata ? There 's only one way it stops . Kill him . Kill him , son . It 's the only way . - Do it , puºtiule . What are you waiting for ? - True , Cade . You want ... Shoot , dammit ! He was a brave man and died so that others might live . - He was a hero . - I am your enemy ! - No . You 're ! - No . - Why ? It was your father . - No , it was a lie . My father would not do that . I won , right ? That means you can overcome all . You 're the one that seeketh him , Cade Foster . The Gua fate depends . But it does not matter . Prophecy ends here . Because your life ends here . But I found . I found the choice . And I thank îþi . Greer , something happens . She did not leave . It 's still there , with Foster . - He ? - Motherfucker . You knew all the time , who 's in his mind Cade . - I helped . - Foster could die . And if he 's not the one . I waited . How you knew that coming here , he had nightmares ? - Master knew . - Who is the Master ? A light , a key ... a response . - Who 're you ? - Someone you meet again . When a great evil will threaten the world you 'll be the only one who can stop him , I will guide you . There are one of us , right ? Humanoid , ie . No , but neither one of them . Îþi will remember everything when the time comes . Îþi will signal a nightmare . But now ... Odihneºte yourself and forget . Cade ? - Baths , where were you ? - I ... I was so worried . You 're right ? I 'm better now , Mom . I 'm at home . - You say you were mysterious man ? - It looks like me , but I think it looks so because it decided to defend my so . I think that a migraine . Came in your mind and put an alarm clock 16 years later . If there is no man nor Gua , then what is ? I do not know " Between blessed and cursed , it will be a third . " Quatrain said that there will be , Eddie . And he . I believe him . You had an ability to capeþi secret " watch the dark . " That must be one hell of a skill . - No sign of Greer ? - Nothing . His office is empty . I have people who seek , but he seems disappeared from the face of the earth . Falls 're okay ? Funny , I always felt guilty for my mother 's death . As if I must save . I thought that Ned was a kind of monster , but it was just a weak man . He could save more than I could have I would save Rose . Please scuzaþi was a long day . I could use a nap . - No more nightmares ? - Enough of this . There are many demons of the past And each of us bears deep inward . Give shape to our lives make us who we are . Can I have disguise our father , mother ... Especially our disguise . But demons can nest . Now I know they were not monsters from YouTube adevãraþi . Mysterious stranger who helped me , He promised a new hope in a dark time . Meanwhile , I wonder what we will bring demons Gua ... While foreigners to return as expected .

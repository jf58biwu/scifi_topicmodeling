We received an anonymous tip as that Inception will be used by Gua . A tip . For someone in my company ? Someone named Nostradamus . A mystic from the 16th century ? How can a prediction 400 years to save an alien invasion ? Mr Foster 're okay ? Would you explain , please ? I can not . I have a better idea . Tell me everything you know about the second wave . What the hell are you doing ? Foster ? Quatrain saying that invading King It is on a throne under 13 faceless warriors I would say that qualifies . It is tough . Poth monitor surveillance system ? Can I make a tour to the ladies room on the 3rd floor if you want . I always wanted to have a look into his office Stareman Voila ! Security system , top floor ... Stareman 's office ... And we 'll see ... Damn ! Stareman ... Stareman is Mabus . Antichrist alien , Gua leader . What ? Almost sell the guy . What are you doing ? Isolating Stareman 's floor , compared to the main system . I do not want to see it , one of the guards . If it is indeed Mabus , we should kill him right away . Nor do we know if we can . I tried to kill the Mabus and survived . - Make a mistake regret . - Do not think so , buddy . Raven Nation can query . You must have information about the second wave . And if you do not talk ... We have something to offer in exchange for a deal with Gua . Agree ? First do whatever you want . We have to get him out of here . Floor checking to see if it 's safe . Even thought I was an alien , due to an obscure quatrain ? He did and I bet that never fail this time either . - Then how do I get your last test ? - I do not know , a new body , perhaps 're a clone . Stareman What did you do ? I have your looks . Foster . Foster ! Damn , you can not hear me . Poth alarm control here ? Ready or not , here I come . Eddie ! I see you , man . I broke Stareman system 's security , I sent a message in which I said that the fire alarm was a test . Eddie , Mabus is going to lift . Poth have it stops ? Yes , I have already done , but go there quickly . Do not get your worry , I will not leave here alive . Foster . Damn . Max Stareman . Max Stareman . - Come on , who 's smarter ? - You blocked all exits ? Safe . It can not quit . You 're sure to like ? Here it is . Oh , no , she noticed . Trying to catch him alive . Agree . Cade was to get shot there . What makes you think it would be faster ? Eddie told me something today . I thought more . - Eddie , what happens ? - I must be interrupted light . Computers are on a separate system . I think I can keep you in , but ... Foster , block means that you have with him . Mabus is still here . - What were you saying ? - It can wait . Go to lift . I take the corridor . We 'll catch the bastard . - Eddie , any sign of him ? - I see nothing here , Foster . Half of the cameras are destroyed . - Eddie , where is it ? - Stareman 's office . Foster ... O are pe Jordan . It 's alive ? I do not know . Foster stopped the camera . We see nothing . What do you think I will ? Eddie , are Stareman his desk . Well , almost done . I again control the security system . - Poth control locks ? - I can try . - Wait a minute . - Come on , Eddie . Oh no , the system closes all . Someone override control . Foster , du-te la uºã . Close door after door , but the next few seconds is open . Damn ! Motherfucker . Jordan ! It 's okay , Cade . It 's mine . What master of the universe . You failed . - Turns it ! - No ! Why , dammit ? I need him alive . I looked at him and I saw my brother , and my father , on all that I loved ... And I wanted and he died ! - What did you say ? - What ? On the corridor . What logged told Eddie . Jordan ar ºti . Cade , how are you ? I am , Jordan . Mabus can transfer the bodies . At the Stareman over . How on what to take with me and now I think you took yourself . Look at me , Cade . I am . What did Eddie , what I wanted to tell you was that ... I 'm afraid ... - Why ? - Do you know ? I was afraid that I love you . I am sorry . - Ce-i ? - Sângerezi . - Do not move the . Not even breathe . - Kill me and 're healed . I know how you feel , Foster . I can feel . Even loves you . Jordan ! No ! When I came into office , Mabus had already in Jordan . Aºadar , Mabus l-a împuºcat pe Stareman . If it 's any consolation . Although Stareman is dead , Gua will still try to - Inception use as a weapon . - I spoke to Jinks . He said he would remove the words that Inception is full of viruses . - It might help . - But it will stop . Maybe it 's too late to stop him . Before Stareman be shot ... I saw the look . He was terrified . I think when Mabus left his body ... It has become Stareman . This means that Jordan is still there , Eddie . Still has a chance . Even if possible , talk about an exorcism series . Foster , it 's possible we could not bring them back . Anyway I will try . ªtiu . And if we can ? Three years ago , Gua stole my life . That first journey brought me to hell . Today stole my hope , hope that my life It will be more than a war without Finally the chances are minimal . The truth is ... I need hope for the future . I need Jordan . Translation and adaptation Florin ( c ) thin

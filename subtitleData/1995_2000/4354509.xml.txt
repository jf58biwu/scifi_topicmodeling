 Previously on The Pretender . I guess your mother never told you about this place . No , she didn 't . She came here exactly this time every year . She loved the spring . - You were in love with her , weren 't you ? - Yes ... but there was a part of her she kept hidden . [ Sydney ] Mr. Lyle shows up . Your father disappears . It 's too coincidental to be just a coincidence . What is it , Jarod ? - I don 't like to be watched . - So your drawing would indicate . - Would you like me to leave ? - No . Not you , Sydney-Them . They record everything , don 't they ? Everywhere I go , everything I do ... every word I say - Shut ' em off , Sydney . Shut the cameras off . I don 't control them , Jarod . - Just ignore them . - But I can 't ! Don 't you understand ? I can feel them on me all the time . There 's nothing I can do , Jarod . It 's not fair . - Just turn ' em off ! - Jarod ! - All right ? Turn ' em off ! - No ! Stop ! [ Man ] Okay , you smile for the camera . All right . We 're all done , kids . [ Giggling ] Ow ! Where 's Planned Parenthood when you need them ? Hey ! How you folks doin ' ? You know we got a special goin ' ... for extra copies for Grandma and Grandpa . Do I look like I drive a minivan ? - Do you know this man ? - Yeah , sure . That 's Jarod - Adams , yeah . He worked here a couple of weeks - good guy . - He gave me this . - [ High-pitched Squeaking ] - [ Laughs ] - Heartwarming . - You know where he is now ? - Nope ... but he did tell me that someone would be by to pick this up . - Right here . - I 'm someone . This is Manhattan . This is extortion . Oh , come on . This is Manhattan . Your parents must be very proud . - [ Phone Rings ] - Excuse me . I think this is meant for you . Oh , a View-Master with no reel . How tragically symbolic . - Why tragically ? - Because it means that I 'll be forced ... to listen to you attach some greater semiotic meaning to that toy . I think the stress of your father 's disappearance is starting to get to you . The only thing getting to me is Jarod . You should consider a vacation . It might help your state of mind . So would putting a bullet in Jarod 's kneecap , but I can 't do that now , can I ? Because I don 't know where he is , do I ? - [ High-pitched Squeak ] - [ Man ] Say " Cheese . ' " [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] - [ Cork Popping ] - [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] That 's a wrap . That was great . [ Chuckles ] - Great gig . - It sure beats shooting triplets . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Man ] Too pasty . Not pasty enough . Get her a trainer . Hmm . I didn 't know Earl Scheib did hair . Come on , Darrin . Don 't you think that 's a little harsh ? Harsh ? From an agent ? Brian , this is a modeling firm ... not a halfway house for former prom queens . - Mr. Faxon . - Jarod . Brian , I assume you 've seen Jarod 's portfolio ? - Very impressive . - No . It 's exceptional . You 've obviously worked with the masters : Avedon , Penn , Newton . Their influence is unmistakable . I enjoyed their books quite a bit . Their books ? Yes , that 's very witty . You 're scheduled to shoot the Cindy Thomas portfolio at 11.30 . I haven 't met her yet , but I hear she 's ... exceptional . Well , she 's still very raw , but her potential is amazing . So far , no photographer has captured that true look ... the elusive quality that will make her the next ... her . [ Jarod ] Kimberly Green . - She died in a car accident , right ? - That 's the official version . - Was there something else ? - A man was stalking Kimberly . But the police think that she drove into the river by accident . There 's no doubt in my mind that he killed her . [ Brian ] Her body was never found . [ Jarod ] And they never captured the stalker ? No . He 's still out there somewhere . Brian , I need you to run those to the agent . I used to have the entire Thunderbirds collection on reels for this . - Thunderbirds ? - Yeah . Well , it 's like Star Wars , only it 's little talking puppet heads . - Kind of like yours , Broots ? - Called your office , but the line was busy . - I was on the phone to St. Thomas . - Your father 's vacation home . I spoke to his houseboy who for six years has spoken perfect English ... but today , when I asked if he 'd seen my father , he couldn 't understand a word . He will come back . - So ? - Oh . So , uh ... this package came for you . It 's from Maine , and it 's moving . Jarod ? Well , I doubt it 's Mrs. Paul . So much for your empty View-Master . Here . You two bond . Miss Parker . " Where 's Daddy ? " [ View-Master Clicking ] - He lives to torment me . - That would beJarod . - Mr. Lyle . - Miss Parker . I 'd swear that we had an appointment in my office 30 minutes ago . A pressing matter arose . Unfortunately , it was a false lead on Jarod . Hmm . That 's too bad . So you came up empty again ? In New York , I believe ? He had already left his last locale when we arrived . Any clue as to where he might be going ? I saw nothing that could be interpreted in that manner . How unfortunate . Excellent with garlic butter . I 'm going out . If anyone asks where I am ... lie . [ Jarod ] You look great , Cindy . Fantastic . ! Ha-ha . ! Extraordinary . Lovely . You look great . Great . [ No Audible Dialogue ] Relax . Have fun . Be a kid . I thought I was supposed to be sexy and provocative . We 're selling you now , so be ... you . Okay . Oh , I know . - [ High-pitched Squeaking ] - Say " Cheese . " That 's it . That 's the one . That was great . - You can go home now . - [ Squeaking ] - All right . [ Laughs ] That was a little ridiculous , but it was a lot of fun . Thank you . - [ Kissing ] - [ Chuckles ] Jarod , that last shot just may be the cover of our next agency catalog . [ Darrin ] Exceptional . I couldn 't agree with Brian more . I am curious , though . Where in the hell did you come up with that technique ? Happy Faces Photo Phun . Excuse me . - [ Knocking ] - Hello ? Excuse me . My name 's Jarod . - Excuse me . - [ Hip-hop On Earbuds ] I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to scare you . [ Stuttering ] N-N-No p-p-problem . I was j-just working . Hmm . A bearded lady . Now I bet people would pay money to see that . J-Just , uh , experimenting . - [ Computer Beeps ] - N-No flaws now . Well , to me , it 's the flaws that make a face interesting - but certainly a photographer like yourselfknows that . I 'm a photo enhancer . But I thought I just saw you taking pictures in the studio . Now , I 'm used to having a camera trained on me ... but other people , they might not feel that way . I t-told you . I 'm n-not a shooter . Okay . It must have been someone that looks like you . Have a nice day . It was nice to meet you . [ Door Closes ] I 'm telling you , Cindy ... Miami has the best doughnuts . Come on . Cuban food and stone crabs maybe . But doughnuts ? I had my first doughnut when I was here . - [ Laughs ] - It 's a long story . You 're right . It 's a great town . I used to love walking around , just taking everything in . - Then after what happened to Kimberly - - [ Shutter Clicking ] - You two were friends ? - Well , as much as she 'd let me . She was a pretty private person - wasn 't really close to anybody except her sister . I didn 't really blame her though . I mean , it 's really tough finding real friends ... when you 're suspicious of everybody . - The stalker . - He made her life a living hell . He used to send her pictures of herself . - What kind of pictures ? - Well , just doing everyday things ... like going to the store , eating in a restaurant . He used to write " You 're mine " over every one of them . Once , he got so close to her , he attacked her with acid . All she ever wanted to be was normal , you know ? I know the feeling . - [ Shutter Clicking ] - Is there something wrong ? No . Everything 's fine . Thank you for walking me home . I really appreciate it . - It 's my pleasure . - Bye . Shut ' em off , Sydney . Shut the cameras off . I don 't control them , Jarod . Just ignore them . But I can 't ! Don 't you understand ? I can feel them on me all the time . - There 's nothing I can do , Jarod . - It 's not fair . Yeah , it wasn 't fair , was it , Kimberly ? [ Sighs ] It just wasn 't fair . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - What ? - [ Jarod ] Little-known fact : - Lobsters make wonderful pets . - Yeah . It was great hearing it scream when I threw it in the boiling water . - There a point to all of this ? - It 's about your father . - I thought that point was clear . - If you know where my father is , tell me . When you tell me where my parents are . I don 't know ! - Find out . - This isn 't funny , Jarod . Now you know how I feel . Happy hunting and tell Gladys I say hello . - Gladys ? Who 's [ Dial Tone ] - [ Miss Parker Sighs ] [ Bell Rings ] Good morning . May I help you ? Would you - Oh ! Miss Parker . - Gladys . - Guilty . Exactly what the hell am I doin ' here , Gladys ? Jarod said you 'd find this very valuable . Sentimental value , I suppose . I 'm all tears . Well , it 's not in very good shape . There are a few pieces missing . [ Box Thuds ] Would you like a cup of tea ? You seem a little tense . What the hell am I supposed to do with this , make kindling ? Jarod said the man you 're having lunch with tomorrow would be able to help . What man ? Where ? Jarod said you 'd know . [ Clock Cuckoos ] [ View-Master Clicking ] You wouldn 't happen to know where there 's a Chuck 's Lobster House , would you ? Although we may never know the exact motives ... of the person who stalked Kimberly Green ... I 've identified several character traits ... which all stalkers exhibit ... by getting into the stalker 's head - becoming the stalker , as it were . First and foremost , the stalker believes the victim belongs to him ... and him alone - hence , attempting to control the victim 's life through fear . By controlling the victim 's actions with fear ... he manipulates her ability to interact with other people . A fear achieved by anonymity - avoiding any face-to-face confrontations with his victim . It 's what the victim can 't see , that is most terrifying . And , in what may have happened in the case of Kimberly Green ... if a victim rejects the stalker 's ... attempts to control her life ... - [ No Audible Dialogue ] - then the stalker is no longer in control ... and can turn to violence . Zoe - I 'm sorry . It 's okay . We 're done . Thank you . I 've been on a few auditions before ... but never anything like this . - What 'd you call it again ? - A simulation . I needed to get inside the head of someone ... who 's doing some pretty horrific things . You did a great job . Thank you . Oh , one question - Why did you walk up to that policeman ? A stranger offers cash to stalk me for a day ? I mean , that 's a little out there . I was startin 'to feel kind of weird , you know ? Well , I 'm sorry if it got too real . I didn 't mean to scare you . Yeah , well , I saw the cop and ... I figured it was time for you to feel a little nervous . It worked . It worked . Well , I don 't usually remember my dreams ... but this particular one was - I was sitting in some kind of a bar ... and , uh , everybody was walking around ... wearing leather ... and , uh ... I was trying to flirt with the bartender - who was a woman . All this time , I 'm talking , saying some really ... clever things - and , you know , like , like " dream-clever " - and , then , she turns around ... and it 's Miss Parker . And , now I 'm - I 'm really turned-on ... and she reaches out and grabs me and pulls me across the bar ... and starts shoving me into a blender . [ Door Opens ] Sorry to interrupt your session . Session ? We 're not having any session . But I 'm trying to get a bead on Miss Parker . - Have either of you seen her ? - No . - Not since lunch . - Oh , no , actually , I think she said ... something about pursuing a lead on Jarod . - Really ? - Yeah . Lunch in Maine - neat trick . Have her call me when she returns ... from lunch . How did he know about our sessions ? Y-You think he heard the part about the blender ? Sydney ? [ Woman On P.A. ] Alexander , call on extension 4 . [ Groans ] S-Sorry . I didn 't see you . You have a good eye , for not being a photographer . - K-Kind of a hobby . - It 's honest . I mean , you 've captured her . I mean , if the rest of these are like this one , you should really show your work . I c-couldn 't do that . N-Never . [ Woman Screams ] - What 's wrong ? - Cindy ! I found this on my vanity . He 's after me now . Why ? Because he needs a new target . I want you to move in with me . I 'll hire a private , 24-hour security guard . It 's not gonna make any difference . If he wants to get me , he 'll get me ... just like he got Kimberly . Welcome to Chuck 's Lobster House . May I help you ? Oh , Miss Parker ! Is there anyone in this burg who doesn 't know me ? Jarod 's table is right this way . You 've got company . Jarod 's here ? I 'm afraid it 's only me . - Ben ? - It would seem Jarod has set us up . [ Man On TV ] While police have ruled ... supermodel Kimberly Green 's death accidental ... her sister , Erika Green , believes , like many ... she was murdered by the stalker who had been harassing her for months . Her sister , Erika Green , believes , like many ... she was murdered by the stalker - [ Door Opens ] My name is Jarod Adams . I 'm a photographer with the Darrin Faxon Agency . - I don 't have anything to say to you people . - The stalker 's back . He 's after one of your sister 's friends , Cindy Thomas . Come in . There 's nothing more difficult than missing family . Kimberly wasn 't the stalker 's only victim . I lost the only family I 've ever had . When was this taken ? One of the foster homes we were in . We had a strange childhood . - I doubt you 'd understand . - Oh , I might . We grew up in the system - went from one foster home to another . You never knew what kind of a situation you were walkin ' into ... but , no matter what , Kimberly would never let anyone hurt us . - [ Phone Rings ] - [ Murmurs ] Excuse me . Yes . Look , this is the fourth time . I told you people I am not switching . I tell you what . Why don 't you give me your home number ... and I 'll call you back ? I didn 't think so . I can 't stand having my privacy invaded . I know what you mean . I think I would 've liked your sister . She strikes me as a survivor . She was . There was only one thing she couldn 't handle . Feeling trapped ... by her life , by the stalker . One fed the other . A way out was all she could think about . I 'm sure it was on her mind when her car went off the bridge . At least now , she 's at peace . [ Computer Buzzes ] - [ Line Rings ] - [ Woman ] 561 Information . - 561 ? - Yes , Boca Raton , Florida . May I help you ? Thank you . That 's all the information I need . No wonder they want your long-distance business , Erika . [ Young Sydney ] Jarod ! Jarod ! - Jarod ! Are you okay ? - Yeah , I 'm all right . Don 't ever do that again , Jarod . I thought you were dead . I thought if I pretended to be dead , everyone would leave me alone . You and me both , Kimberly . You and me both . - Another . - [ Man ] Right away , Miss Parker . Courtesy ofJarod , I think I have finally reached the end of my rope - frayed , I might add . I haven 't seen this in years . - Was it yours ? - No , it was your mother 's . Jarod stayed with me a few months ago . It 's starting to make sense to me now . - What is ? - His preoccupation with your mother - and this . He told me the next time you and I met , to give it to you . I don 't know why , but I 've been carrying it with me everywhere . She dances in there . Hmm . I 'm afraid it doesn 't work without the other figurine . I 'm sorry . I don 't know where it is . I thought this was lost ... butJarod found it tucked away in the attic ... along with some other items that belonged to your mother . She bought it one day when we were together . It always reminded me of her delicate beauty ... her graceful dancer 's gait . - My mother was a dancer ? - A great one . She never told you ? I am learning that there are a lot of things she never told me ... but it certainly explains all the lessons I took as a child . - Do you still dance ? - No , I stopped when she - Yup . She stopped too ... after she met your father . Ben do you know where my father is ? He 's missing ... and Jarod led me here in hopes that I would find him . I 'm sorry . I don 't know about your father , only your mother . - So ? This could 've been taken anytime . - You know that it wasn 't . Erika , I know that you speak to your sister every night at 10.30 . - I am not the stalker . - And you expect me to just believe that ? I know where Kimberly is . If I was the stalker , if I wanted to invade her privacy ... I would be doing that instead of standing here talking to you - the one person that can help her to trust me . I understand how she feels . No one could understand that . I do . I told you , Jarod . You 're safe here . They 're not watching you . This is the only camera in my office . I took it out of the ceiling this morning - but , remember , it 's only a special favor to you . I have to put it back in a few minutes . So , we can talk ? Just you and me ? - You can do anything you like . - [ Chuckles ] - What is it , Jarod ? - There 's something in the clock . Right here in the middle . You said they weren 't watching . Jarod , believe me , I didn 't know . You said I 'd be safe here . You promised ! - [ Scoffs ] - Jarod ! Damn you . [ Gull Mewing ] After he attacked , faking my death was my way out . Out of one trap , into another . Instead of living a nightmare , I just have them now . - What are they about ? - Always the same thing . His eyes . The night he attacked , I felt his eyes on me all day long ... and as I approached my building , I turned , and he was standing there ... wearing a ski mask ... hiding his face as he tried to spray acid on mine . The only thing that registered were his eyes . Tell me about them . They were cold . They had no feeling . Was there any place that you felt safe ? Home - and at the agency ... but you know , near the end , I felt like I was being watched even there . - I think I was just being paranoid . - I don 't think so . The public doesn 't know who Cindy Thomas is , but the stalker does . - You think he has access to the agency ? - I don 't know ... but I need your help to find out . I need you to help me find those eyes . - No , Jarod . - It 's the only way out of this trap . Trust me . I think I know a way . The relationship between your mother and I ... lasted almost 15 years before she died . I can still see her beautiful vision walking up to the inn ... on that sunny day in April . I was on a ladder when she called to me . Her roadster had broken down . And she tried to fix it herself . Yes . She was covered in oil . [ Both Chuckle ] So did you help her with the car ? She helped me to the doctor . - I fell off the ladder . - [ Laughing ] Ben . That 's how she was , always helping others ... even when she was in need . Was that the spring you two fell in love ? That was the spring we became friends . That 's all we were for many years . She would come up to the inn every April ... spend the first two weeks . I lived for those weeks of joy . It may sound corny , but it was the simple things she loved : gathering flowers down by the lake , watching the stars . Catherine had an unquenchable zest for life ... a sparkle ... until - She met my father ? Well , at first she seemed happy ... but year after year , the sparkle faded . - But she kept coming to see you . - Well , I was an oasis ... from the life she was trapped in . She never told me about that life - only her feelings . That 's the way she was with me . It was many years before our lips touched ... but I truly believe that we were meant to spend our lives with each other - but we could only have what we had . I hate to know that she was so sad . She was until you came along . After you were born , the sparkle returned . - [ Laughs ] - You gave her the strength to remember who she was . She was making big changes in her life ... but then she was gone . God , I miss her . - I do too . - [ Laughs ] Don 't be sad . She was never sad when she talked about you ... and that was all she really ever wanted to talk about . What was the other figurine that went in here ? Another dancer , a little girl . A shame they can 't dance together anymore . - What are you d-doing here ? - Your work . It 's excellent . I can 't believe you 've never shown this to anybody . I t-told you I c-couldn 't do that . Toby , you have a gift . It 's like the camera speaks for you . These are b-beautiful people . I 'm not-not one of them . Beauty is more than appearance . It 's also about real emotion . I look at your photographs , especially the eyes of your subjects ... and I see a lot of that emotion . What do you want ? - [ Kimberly ] Toby took these ? - Of everyone who was at the shoot . Anything ? No , maybe he wasn 't there . Maybe he 's changed his habits . Stalkers , they always hunt their prey in the same way over and over again . He was there . Wait a minute . What 's this ? There 's a figure behind this backdrop . [ Beeping ] [ Kimberly ] Oh , my God . Brian . Too puffy , no heroin chic . Oh , please , send this one to Bob Vila , maybe he needs a new hand model . This just came in for you , Brian . - Mr. Faxon , Paris is calling on the conference line . - Oh , lovely . - Kimberly . - Hello , Brian . Kimberly . ! Kimberly ! Kimberly ! - Hey ! - What 's your problem ? My name is Zoe . I 'm sorry . I thought you - What ? Hey ! - [ Door Closes ] - Who 's there ? You 're trapped , Brian . Now how does it feel ? Over here , Brian . - Kimberly ? - This way , Brian . - Cindy ? - You can 't see us ... but we can see you . Now we have all the power . - Who are you ? - I 'm you , Brian . I 'm weak . I 'm a coward . I hide in shadows and watch , because creating fear in others ... is the only way that I have strength . - What do you want ? - [ Thuds On Floor ] Are you feeling trapped , vulnerable , terrified ? Just like Kimberly and Cindy felt . Are you afraid I 'm going to hurt you ? The worst part is , you don 't know how ... and you don 't know when ... but then again , that 's what stalking is all about ... isn 't it ? Admit it , Brian . They rejected you and thatjust tore you up inside . I just wanted to be with them . You wanted control ! And when you couldn 't have your way with Kimberly , you stalked her ... and you trapped her and you tried to destroy her ... with acid ... and then you stalked Cindy in the very same way . I just wanted Kimberly and Cindy to be mine . Oh , well , now you 're mine . [ Screaming ] Will you relax , Brian ? It 's just CO2 and water . What 's the matter , Brian ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . I thought you - I thought you were - No . I 'm not - and I 'm not afraid anymore either . Relax . Let your portfolio speak for itself . Don 't worry . Darrin 's going to love your work . l-I never thought this day would come for me . N-No matter what happens , I th-thank you , Jarod . Knock ' em dead . [ House ] [ Continues ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Ringing ] - What ? - Pretty isn 't it ? - Pretty ? - The music . As usual , Jarod , there is no music at the end of one of your games . Oh , well , I am very sorry that you didn 't have a nice trip ... but you have everything you need to find what you 're looking for . [ View-Master Clicking ] - [ Winding ] - [ Music Box ] Why did you give me this , Jarod ? Let 's just say , " Happy birthday , Miss Parker . " My birthday isn 't until January 3 . That 's the point . [ Ben ] She would come up to the inn every April . May , June , July , August ... September , October , November ... - December . - [ Door Opens ] [ Groans ] I 've been lookin 'all over for that . Daddy ? How you doin ' , angel ? You been poaching ' from my office ? [ Stammering ] You 've been gone for over a month . Where have you been ? If I told ya , I couldn 't protect ya . Now come along . Mr. Lyle and Mr. Raines want to meet with us . - But , Daddy - - Just listen to your father ... and follow my lead , hmm ? Of course . [ Music Box ]

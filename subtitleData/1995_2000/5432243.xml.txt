Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1 st Class , is about to embark on a one-year manned mission to Titan , the 14th moon of Saturn . This highly prestigious assignment was guaranteed Jerome at birth . He 's blessed with all the gifts required . A genetic quotient second to none . There 's nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow . Except that I am not Jerome Morrow .

GENETICIST : Your extracted eggs , Marie , have been fertilised with Antonio 's sperm . After screening , we are left with two healthy boys and two very healthy girls . Without predispositions to any inheritable diseases . All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate . What gender do you want ? We would want Vincent to have a brother to play with . Of course you would . Hello , Vincent . Hi . You have specified hazel eyes , dark hair and fair skin . I 've eradicated prejudicial conditions : Premature baldness , myopia , alcoholism and addictive susceptibility , propensity for violence , obesity . We didn 't want ... I mean , diseases , yes .

How many astronauts are there ? I bet I could be one if I wanted . Don 't eat that . It 's Pluto . My goals didn 't change a lot . Vincent . Much to my parents ' dismay . Vincent . Be realistic .

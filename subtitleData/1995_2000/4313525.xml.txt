 Where in the Hezmana is that siren coming from ? Sounds like from the inside of my head . What the Hezmana is it ? It 's definitely Peacekeeper . Don 't do that at me . - What ? - That ! That ... I can 't help it , the sound frequency 's doing something to my eye . Feels like it 's melting my brain . Couldn 't actually be doing something to my brain , could it ? DRDs have located the siren 's point of origin . Tier Seven , rear storage compartment . We 're there , Pilot ... The DRDs are removing the cover now . Can 't you stop that noise ? Let me see ! - Pilot , good work ! You 've stopped it ! - I have only neutralised the internal sound , the device itself is still broadcasting some kind of signal into deep space , using Moya 's hull as a maximiser . It 's using my skull as a maximiser ! Why am I still twitching ? It 's a Paddac beacon , it starts broadcasting unless it gets a signal from the control collar . Which we removed . And why didn 't you tell us about this ? Well , not all Leviathan transports have them , I had no way of knowing , Oh look , I new to all this escaped prisoner crap , alright ? Oh , no ! It won 't let DRDs near it . The external broadcast is increasing exponentially . If there 's a Peacekeeper patrol , within a quarter light cycle they know exactly where we are . Aeryn , can the device be removed ? I 'll get it out ! - Pilot , can the device be removed ? - I 'm running diagnostics now . Even if it can be removed , it will take time . Meanwhile we 're broadcasting our position like a two headed Tronkan shrill singer ! Look , if we can 't remove it , can 't we at least muffle it somehow ? It is using all of Moya 's hull . John , there is no way to insulate Moya 's entire outer skin . Pilot , shut down power to this section , at least ... That is Moya 's primary neural nexus , I cannot shut that down . Water ! Pilot , this system we 're passing through , the middle planet . - It 's got water , right ? - Thirty percent surface moisture . Not so much water as ... bog . Fine , fine , bog , we 'll use the bog as insulation . What , and take Moya down onto the planet 's surface ? Well she can do that , right ? ... Right ? Pilot ? When Leviathans are young , they often play with a planet 's gravity , see how close they can come . There 's a tale told about an adult male who once touched down on a planet 's surface , though no one knows if it 's true or not . Well if she can 't , she can 't , or we can stick our heads between our legs and kiss our asses goodbye . It 's a saying ! Wait ! Wait ! I 'm not ready ! Somebody help tie me down ! Pilot , how 's Moya doing ? Atmospheric friction within tolerable limits , but she 's starting to feel the gravity , definitely feeling the increased weight . Just , put her down in that swamp we targeted . It 's probably not going to matter much , but you 'd better get yourself in position for landing . Looks like earth . Brace yourselves ! We 're down , Moya has landed . Am I the only one seeing this ? ... We 're sinking ! My name is John Crichton , an astronaut . A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life forms . Listen , please ! Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? I 'm being hunted by an insane military commander who can do everything , I can 't . I 'm just looking for a way home . Pilot , does that mean that we 've ... Stopped sinking ? Yes ! We 're almost completely submerged . - You okay ? - Okay ? No , I 'm not okay ! We are in the mud , under the mud . You 're Hynerian ! You 're aquatic ! What 's your problem ? Aquatic , that 's water , not mud ! Mud is ... mud , You can 't breathe in it , you can 't move in it . It holds ya , it grabs ya , it sucks you down . You want to know about mud ? I know about mud ! The guy knows mud . - And the beacon ? - Muffled ... The mud 's insulating the transmission . - And how 's Moya ? - Very scared . This beacon was hastily installed . So we just cut it out of there and we can fly off this blasted planet . I told you , it won 't let DRDs near it . Well , somebody 's got to go in there . Oh no , you covered me in mud because I have no say . but in this , I have a say , and I say no ! Get someone else to do your dirty work . He 'll do it ... With apologies , but that is Moya 's primary neural nexus . It is an intensely sensitive area . Well how sensitive is sensitive ? Look , she 's just going to have to endure it . Could you be a little sensitive ? Look , can we cut this thing out ? The level of pain will be intolerable ! She may die ! Pilot , is there any kind of anaesthetic ? Something we could use to apply to ease Moya 's pain ? An anaesthetic ? For a Leviathan ? There is without question , no such ... Pilot ? Chlorium ! - Chlorium ? - It 's an element . It is one of the six forbidden cargoes . Leviathans cannot transport it because it ... numbs them . - Is there any on board ? - Never ! It 's a very common element , it 's found in many forms . It 's an atmospherically induced isotope of twinium . Is there any out there ? Yo , Aeryn ! Let 's go ! Hey , this is your chance to flex those big peace keeper commando muscles out in the field Peacekeeper commando . Yeah , really . Is there a problem ? Oh , I find and explain our top secret tracking device , to a bunch of escaped prisoners , and then lead a mission to destroy it . Well number one , you 're not leading the mission . Number two , those Peacekeepers you 're so concerned about ... They 'd kill you right now . It 's the Peacekeepers ... Turned on me for speaking up for you . I don 't know what I was thinking . Well back home we 'd call it being stand up . Well I stood up , and I no longer have a home . Well join the club . Does this bother you ? Because it bugs the crap out of me . So can we go , before we become a permanent tourist attraction in this bog ? And my eye falls out ? Jeez ! Kind of like Louisiana ... Or Degoba ... Degoba , where Yoda lives . Who 's Yoda ? Just a little green guy ... Trains warriors . This particle analyser is defective ... - It 's Peacekeeper technology ! You , use it ! - Techs use them , not infantry . Here , Pilot said you press this , this and this . Well , it 's just like a VCR , except easier . Oh , whoa , we got something . That 's a weak reading , at that level , we 'll have to bring back half the planet . We need to find a concentrated source . What 's that ? What the hell is that ? Vehicle ! Take cover ! - We need to draw them away from the ship . - We need chlorium . Aeryn and I will distract them . You find the chlorium and we 'll all meet back at the ship . Pilot , did you send for me ? I have completed tracing the connection points between the Peacekeeper beacon and Moya 's neural system . - Yes ? - The interlacing is extremely intricate . Pilot , how did the Peacekeepers ever get such a device aboard without you or Moya knowing about it ? When Peacekeepers capture a Leviathan , they immediately administer a sleep agent , very potent . The weak , the old , do not survive , which I suppose is part of its purpose . While the Leviathan sleeps , the control collar is set in place , modifications are made in propulsion and guidance . I ... thought I had discovered all they had done to Moya . Obviously I had not . Pilot , don 't blame yourself . I 'm afraid even with the chlorium , there will not be enough time to complete the separation before Moya succumbs to her own intense weight . Okay , great ! Fertiliser ? This stuff could have been made on earth . Okay , maybe not . Crichton ? - Where are you ? - Yuh , I 'm here . - Where are you ? I 'm in some kind of barn . - I 'm with D 'Argo , where ... - Fine , you go . - We 're half a metra from the ship , still drawing fire from the locals . Have you got the chlorium yet ? No , no , not yet . I 'd feel a whole lot better if we could hook up again . Come on , where are you guys ? Who 's there ? Who are you ? What are you doing around my Mom 's stuff ? Don 't be afraid . Hey , I 'm not going to hurt you . Where are you from ? Um , I 'm from a long ... a long way away . You 're from space ? Yeah , I guess I am . - So what 's your name ? - Fostro . Well Fostro , my name is John . Fostro , wait ! Wait ! - Mom ! - Fostro ! It 's not a weapon ... I 'm putting it down , just ... I 'm putting it down . Fostro ! - Is that your Mom ? - Mom ! No ! Fostro ! No ! I can 't move . Fostro ! I am in the middle of what may be a very real extraterrestrial event , This is not the moment for you to ... Why can 't I move ? I ... I can 't feel my body ! Oh ... my ... God ! All my bones are ... Fostro , get back ! Not another step ! Please , I already told your boy , I 'm not here to harm you . - Where are you from ? - He 's from space ! He must have come down in that thing you were tracking last night . My name is John Crichton , and I 'm from ... I 'm talking to an alien ! You 're an alien ... and I 'm talking to you ... in my kitchen ! You gotta call somebody , Mom ! Go outside ! Get in the wheeler ! Get in the wheeler now ! Outside ! Now ! Hey , wait ! You don 't think we came alone , do you ? If we wanted to contact some government sort of agency ... we would have ! We chose you . If this is about me climbing around in the ship 's entrails , then you can simply turn around and go back the way you came . With permission , your Eminence ... Yes . Pilot 's done all he can , but the device won 't allow a DRD or anything metal near it . We can 't wait till the others return . We have to start the separation procedure immediately . And what about the great ship 's pain ? Among my sect , I am a ninth level Pa 'u . A priest of that level can harbour the power to ... share another being 's pain . If you are willing to begin procedure , I will do all that I can to alleviate Moya 's discomfort . This is an awfully big ship . Don 't I know it . Careful , Peacekeeper . Peacekeeper ... If I were still a Peacekeeper , would I be sitting on this planet next to you ? It 's been long enough , I say we go ! Not quite yet ... those hounds are still out there , they could track us down in a second . Oh fine , let 's just perch here and do nothing then . Listen , Aeryn , if you have a problem with my strategy ... I should have known that this would be Luxan strategy . It 's probably why you did so well against the Grisoldians . Grisoldians ? What do you know of them ? Oh , everyone knows about that battle , how Luxans went screaming into retreat so fast ... Those monsters murdered thousands of Luxan women and children . We had no alternative but to retreat . We soon took our revenge . And murdered thousands of their women and children . We had no alternative to that either . I 'm sure the Grisoldians said the same thing . I 'm here because I need something . - Something for my ship . - Where is your ship ? It 's not far from here . There are others like you ? Like me ? Well , there are others , yeah . My readings flew way off the chart . The whole town is buzzing about this giant something that flew in low over Kazda 's Swamp . That 's where your ship is ... Kazda Swamp . - Mom , we gotta tell ! - Fostro ! Look , I understand what a phenomenal moment this is for you . Do you ? Can you ? I mean to you , space travel is commonplace , but to us , here , I mean in one flash ... You 've learned that you 're not alone in the universe . That interstellar space travel 's possible . That a zillion of your empirical facts about science , religion are wrong , or completely suspect . I do understand . I 'm not exactly what you expected , am I ? I always thought that when we finally made contact , first contact , the beings we meet would be so radically different ... You 're so much like us . Yeah , it 's a real kick in the paints , ain 't it ? So , have you been searching long ? Since I was Fostro 's age . My parents bought me a telescope ... I used to look up at the stars at night and dream about ... this moment . You said you chose me . Well , we saw the radio telescopes ... and we figured you might be somebody who 'd understand us , not hurt us . Hoped you would be . You have ... star charts ? - and deep space photographs ? - Yes . There 's a chance I might recognise something . Constellations , galaxies . I might even get a fix on the Milky Way , maybe even Earth . Don 't you even know where you are ? - Are you in position ? - Yes , I 'm in position . What is this thing I have to cut with ? Well you can 't use a metal tool . I found that in D 'Argo 's quarters , I believe it 's made from bone . Oh , this is a Tokaar knife . You know what ceremony young Luxan males use this for ? On themselves ? ... At that certain age ? Then I suspect that D 'Argo will want it back , unharmed . - Are you ready ? - Yes , I 'm ready . Moya , I will take your pain . You may begin . Here goes . Continue ! Rygel , you must continue ! This place reminds him of home . - What ? - Crichton ... He says that this primordial rock actually reminds him of his earth . No interplanetary travel , retrograde technology , fossil fuel burning ground vehicles . ... He 's a savage . - Does that bother you ? - No , of course not . Look , he 's had plenty of time to find the chlorium , I 'm going back . - Signal me immediately if he 's there . - And if he 's not there ? I will go find him . You think I will not ? I think I 'll be searching for both of you in less than an arne . Fostro , it 's almost ready . But Mom , I 'm not hungry - You haven 't had breakfast yet and you 're going to eat ! So you ... work for some kind of school ? University ? Military ... They provide most of my funding , what 's left of it ... according to them , it 's highly unlikely you even exist . They 're my biggest concern , I 'm ... I 'm not quite sure how they 'd treat you if they knew you were here . Our military isn 't the most compassionate , tolerant group . No , militaries rarely are . So I 'd be a real coup for you . Walking , talking evidence of extraterrestrial life . I 'd say my funding 'd be pretty much set for life . Fostro . I made some for you , I don 't know if you eat . Don 't even know if you 're hungry , hell , for all I know , this stuff could be horribly toxic for you . - What is that ? - Oh no , no , no , it 's just an analyser . It 's a science tool , it 's telling me there 's some of what I need , somewhere near here . It 's in the food ? How can it be in the ... Okay , I 'm looking for an element called chlorium . It 's what I 'm looking for and there 's got to be some somewhere here in this ... What the hell is this ? What is this ? I 'm sorry . Look , whatever is in this container , this is what my ship needs . It 's the military . Lyneea ! - Fostro , take him to your room ! ... Go ! - But Mom ... - No , you don 't have to do this ... - Go ! Moya is in intense pain . Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Zhaan ! Pilot , I think Zhaan is ... Pilot ? Pilot ? Pilot ! Wake up ! Wake up , you worthless weak shank of blue flesh ! Are you there ? Are you there ? - Pilot ? - Anyone there ? Yes , of course we 're here ! I 've been screaming by shaltan head off ! Moya is succumbing ! She 's ... collapsing . You know when I was your age , I used to dream of meeting a real , live alien . Yeah , me too . Your phone 's broken ? Well , I dropped it in all the excitement when I thought ... 'Thought ' nothing . We have confirmation this time . Mount Versant Observatory says that something definitely punched through the upper atmosphere last night . - This means so little to you ? - I just remember last year ... Versant declared a definite U.E.O. sighting , turned out to be a terrestrial anomaly . Anomaly ? That 's not what you reported earlier . I just want to be sure , I need more time to check my data . There is definitely something out there , Lyneea , civilians have seen it . This is the day you prove all of us who doubted you wrong . I don 't understand , when you first contacted me , you were extremely excited about your readings . - I 'm still excited ... - No , you 're nervous . Looks like they 're making us their base of operations . Well , it 's standard procedure during an actual event , and they know it 's real this time . Commander Ryymax was asking where you were . You 'd better go out there or he 'll get suspicious . Does he have to ? You say nothing ... You understand me ? And they know it 's real this time . He 's not gonna ... There 's a very good chance I 'm going to get captured here , right ? Well before I am ... I at least need to let my ship know about this . But it 's only onlux ! Just onlux ! It is what they need . Here Aeryn ! Here ! What 's wrong ? We need to take off immediately ! The ship is collapsing and Pilot is refusing to follow my commands . - Zhaan ? - We 've run out of time ... We need to remove the device right now . If you do it , you do it without me ! You 're the only one small enough , come on ! Wait outside ... Please let me . Your greatest fear will come to pass , Hynerian . Someday you will die at the hands of a Peacekeeper . As though you 'll get the chance , before we 're all crushed or I kill the ship myself . You 're afraid ? You 're afraid this great ship will die ? I don 't know what I 'm doing , I have always had others to do for me . Even in prison ... I don 't even know how to hold a tool . There is great pain in this for all of us , isn 't there ? Come , we 'll face the pain together . Will he do it ? I believe so . I have something that 'll heal that ... - Later ! We deal with the ship first . - Of course . What 's taking him so long ? Give him a moment , it 's a big responsibility riding on those not-so-large shoulders . Are you truly able to take away the ship 's pain ? This entire ship ? I only share the pain . I 'm afraid that Moya still bears the larger portion . I don 't know how she 's doing it . What about how you 're doing it ? Are you laughing at me ? Ah , no , no my dear , I 'm not laughing . You just seemed very briefly to be concerned for me . I 'm concerned only that you 're able to complete your undertaking to share Moya 's pain . Yes , of course . We 're going to need biological containment ... No , we haven 't trapped anything yet ... but I want us to be one hundred percent ready when we do . Yes , I said when . A ' wormhole ' ? That 's what we call it . Well , I know the phenomenon you 're talking about , we call it a ' ribbon hole ' . Although theoretically , they don 't really exist . Well , they didn 't exist for me either until I got sucked down one . So you don 't even know where your home is ? I have no idea . You didn 't really choose me , did you ? No . Okay , listen , I 've routed this through the main dishes outside . It 's as strong as I can get it and it 's very broad band . Aeryn , D 'Argo , are you there ? Can you guys read me ? Aeryn ? Are you out there , D 'Argo ? Crichton ? Crichton , is that you ? How is your signal getting through ? Our comms will not penetrate the mud . Moya is bearing up . Is this guy more what you were expecting ? Sir , you gotta come quick ! Now sir ! - Mom ! - Fostro ! Another one ! They 've captured another one ! Sorry Moya , but I have to cut fast . Wrong move ! We found him less than half a milon from here . Look at him ! He 's phenomenal ! You and Fostro are going to have to get out of the area immediately . It 's no longer safe for you here . - Is he alright ? - Who are you ? What kind of ship are you ? That thing on the computer in there , and now this one , trying to pull down my barn ! You said you were a scientist . A science ship . I am a scientist ! My ship is ... It 's a prison transport , ... escaped prisoners . - Prisoners ? - Yeah . - You ? - Look , it 's a galactic misunderstanding . Here ! Take your precious onlux and get out of my house ! Go , now ! - Not without my friend . - Oh , it 's too late for him ! He 's going to be laid open on an autopsy table by dawn tomorrow . That 's what I 've been trying to protect you from ! I won 't go without him . Only a few more to come . Get me back ! Get me back ! Rygel , get it done in there ! Your encouragement is much appreciated ! It just started coming up ... I was recalibrating and all of a sudden , it started ... Wait till you see it , Ryymax ! It is unbelievable ! Watch ! Watch this ! Crichton ? Crichton , is that you ? How is your signal getting through ? Our comms will not penetrate the mud . Moya is bearing up ... Pa 'u Zhaan is helping all she can , but we need the chlorium . Do you have a fix on the origin of this signal ? Zeta Team , move out ! Stay back , boy ! You took your time . Hey kid , wanna shake his hand ? Go ahead , he doesn 't bite . See ? Here , this is yours . Ryymax and his men are off searching Akon 's Field , It 's in the opposite direction from the swamp . I wish there was more I could do . You 've altered the perceptions and beliefs of an entire planet . Yeah , I guess that 's enough for one day . Crichton , we must go ! It will be dark soon , we may not find our way back . Keep watching the skies . That 's how your people say goodbye ? What , you people don 't do that ? Goodbye ... D 'Argo . You are the luckiest nine year old around . Someday you are going to have a very singular story to tell . Can 't tell it for a long time , of course , ... but someday . Oh , bias ! Rygel ! Pilot ! Aeryn ? Crichton , where are you ? We 're back ! D 'Argo and I are back . Pilot , prepare for lift off ! I can 't ! What do you mean you can 't ? The pain along the neural nexus is too great . I can 't get control of Moya 's propulsion systems ! Just hold on ! We 're coming down . Hurry , will you ! Hurry ! It 's done ... It 's done ! The beacon is no longer broadcasting ! I did it , I did it . I did it ! Yo Rygel ! Start spreading this around , everywhere you cut . Your attention . Prepare to lift off . As Moya has never done this before , I don 't know what to expect . Zhaan ... Zhaan ... It 's done ! Aeryn , let 's go ! Never , ever again . We 're free ! We 're going to make it . Don 't tell me you 're going to miss that rock . No , not that rock .

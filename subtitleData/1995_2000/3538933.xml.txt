 It really puts things in perspective . From up here , an entire world can seem utterly insignificant . Fear of a ' Bot Planet Nice seats ! We 're close enough ... ... to when you hit a player with a bottle , he 's down . I don 't get it . Is blernsball the same as baseball ? Baseball ? God forbid . Face it , Fry . Baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie . - That 's why they jazzed it up . - Boring ? Baseball wasn 't- - So they finally jazzed it up . Home run ! Right ? Out ! What happened ? Why 's the ball on that spring ? It 's tradition , like aluminum bats and the seventh-inning grope . I got me a souvenir ! Here you go , kid . I 'd like a jumbo squid log , please . We don 't sell those . All right . Let me have one of your young on a roll . We 're out of rolls . Fine . Just give me something crawling with parasites . [ GROWLS ] At least hot dogs didn 't change . - Buddies , who wants popcorn ? LEELA : I 'll have some ! [ POPPING ] Anyone want butter on that ? I 'm getting the hang of this . The blerns are loaded ... ... count 's 3 blerns , 2 anti-blerns , and the blern rule 's in effect , right ? Except for the word " blern , " that 's total gibberish . MAN : Multi-ball ! Multi-ball ! MAN : Blern ! Blern ! All right ! Yes ! Miller 's on a pace to hit 70 blerns . He 's good , all right . But he 's no Clem Johnson . And Johnson played back in the days before steroids were mandatory . That sack of skin wouldn 't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues . Now , Wireless Joe Jackson , there was a blern-hitting machine . Exactly . He was a machine designed to hit blerns . Wireless Joe was a programmable bat on wheels . And I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer ? Humans are so scared of robot competition ... - ... you won 't let us on the field . - There 's a lot of robots down there . Yeah . Doing crap work . They 're batboys , ball polishers , sprinkler systems . But how many robot managers are there ? - Eleven ? - Zero ! And what a surprise ! Look who 's scraping up the filth ! Is it a human child ? I wish ! Whoa , dear Lord ! What 's wrong ? It 's my new pager . This is Hermes . A package just came in . Return to the office immediately . [ GROANING ] Get away , you filthy bird . Professor ? Turn me off , quick ! I 'm sorry . What ? See you at the office ! BENDER : Admit it ! You think robots are just machines built to make life easier . Well , aren 't they ? I 've never made anyone 's life easier , and you know it ! Great news , everyone . You 'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9 . Where humans are killed on sight . - Why is that great news ? - I 'm glad you asked that question . You see , Chapek 9 was colonized centuries ago ... ... by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists . Just because a robot wants to kill humans , he 's a " radical . " Hold on . I understand these robots hate humans . But how do they feel about humanoid aliens ? They 're not fans . Bender will have to make the delivery . I get it . Make the robot do all the work . This is the first actual work you 've ever done here . Well , I 'm not doing it ! It 's a robot holiday . Really ? Which one ? Only Robanukah . The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar . Come on , Bender . Last month , it was Robomadom . And before that , Robonza . - Man , that one was a blast . - Not just a blast ... ... it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes ... ... which took the form of a drinking contest . Bender , I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires . But you used all your days off when you had Roberculosis . All right , I 'll go . But I 'll hold a grudge against every last one of you ... ... for the rest of your lives . Well then , it 's settled . So long , everyone . So , this planet is completely uninhabited ? No . It 's inhabited by robots . Kind of like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes . Okay , Bender . Time to get to work . Yes , Ms. Leela . Tote that space barge . Lift that space bale . We can 't land on the surface , the robots will kill us . We 'll stay and lower you with the winch . Remember , you don 't know humans , you don 't work for humans ... ... and above all , you don 't like humans . I 'll try to keep that in mind . - He seems pretty angry . - Yeah . I 'd be angry too , if I had to go to an uninhabited planet . Let 's do something nice for him . LEELA : There . This will show that stupid robot we care . [ BEEPING ] Bender 's done with the delivery , I 'm in trouble . They found out I work with humans and- - Oh , no ! - My God ! We have to rescue him . - No , they 'll kill us . What will we do ? I don 't know . It 's not an easy decision . If only I had two or three minutes to think . To save Bender , we 've got to look and act exactly like robots . I 'm fully operational . We have to walk and talk like robots , and maybe ... ... solve differential equations like robots . I can dance like a robot . Will that help ? Fry . First of all , this is serious . Second of all : We look stupid . We should 've gotten store-bought costumes . - But there 's no Woolworth 's nearby . GUARD 1 : Halt ! Be you robot or human ? Robot we be . Just two robots out roboting it up . Heh ? Administer the test . Which of the following would you most prefer : A : A puppy ? B : A pretty flower from your sweetie ? Or C : A large , properly formatted data file ? Choose ! [ WHISPERING ] - Is the puppy mechanical at all ? - No . It 's the bad kind of puppy . We 'll go with the data file . - Correct . - The flower would 've been acceptable . GUARD 2 : You may pass . LEELA : If you see robots , stay out of their way . LEELA : So far , so good . - Little to the right . Okay . - Have you seen this robot ? Sorry . Can 't help you . Hey ! Watch it ! Don 't drop that there ! Oh ! Come on , Fry . Walk like a robot . - I have to go to the bathroom . - Robots don 't have bathrooms . Right . Where do they smoke in high school ? Just go behind those garbage cans . I 'll stand guard . [ UNZIPS PANTS ] [ HUMS ] Hurry up , Fry ! Sir ? Are you aware you 're leaking coolant at an alarming rate ? - Let me patch you up with hot resin . - I think the leak 's stopping . Wait . Wait . Yeah , there we go . Wait . Yeah . What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing-hot resin ? Uh- - I 'm sorry . My friend and I have to do some mindless , repetitive tasks . Sounds like a romantic evening . I won 't keep you . [ SNEEZES ] - Get the humanoids . - Get the intruder . ROBOT : Intruder alert . Quick ! Let 's duck in here ! ANNOUNCER : We interrupt this sound file for an announcement : A nonmetallic being is in the vicinity of Make-Out Point . Say , Wendy ? Your chassis 's scuffed . Mind if I polish it for you ? Did you hear that ? It sounded like a human . Relax , Wendy . Humans will never come to our little town . It 's perfectly safe to let our guard down . I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs ! Behold ! Wow ! The 3-D 's great ! Mine 's not working . Funny , isn 't it ? The human 's impervious to our powerful magnetic fields . Yet in the end , he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick . - I 'm glad the nightmare 's over . - It 'll never be over . Even now , humans lurk in our playgrounds , breezeways ... ... perhaps even our movie theaters ! FRY : God help us ! Okay . Keep an eye out for Bender . What did you think of the movie ? Too much romance , not enough human killing . It was a real chick flick . [ FANFARE PLAYS ] What 's that ? What do you mean , " What 's that ? " It 's 5 : 00 . Time for the daily human hunt . Stay with the crowd so no one sees how crummy you look . - That was uncalled for . - I 'm over here . I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738 . I heard they unscrew our lug nuts at night and eat them at brunches . Welcome to a very special human hunt . We have a guest whose irrational hatred for humans ... ... makes me look like a human sympathizer . [ LAUGHING ] A newly-arrived refugee from Earth , let 's hear it for ... ... Bender ! It 's him ! He 's okay ! Death to the humans ! Ah , it 's good to hear his voice . Many said I was too extreme when I called for ... ... the annihilation of humans ... ... as well as some of the more cunning monkeys . After living on Earth , I can tell you that I am , if anything ... ... too merciful . [ CHEERING ] My God ! He 's become evil . I mean , eviler . Thank you . And if you enjoyed that diatribe ... ... you 'll want to purchase my spoken-word album . Just $ 1 8.95 . Act now , and you 'll get this Bender action figurine . Bite my shiny metal ass . Let the hunt begin ! Now , your basic human is between three and 25 feet tall ... ... and is made of a hairy , oily goo in a T-shirt . Do they bite you , suck your fluid ... - ... and you become human ? - Sure . - Anything in the trap ? - Nothing . Nothing . Humans prefer low-calorie bait . Well , that makes 1 46,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row . But I 've got a good feeling about tomorrow . Wait ! What 's that ? That 's the abandoned adult-book store . Nothing there , except a few shreds of old robot pornography . Sounds like a breeding ground for humans . I 'll check it out . Oh , yeah . You 're a bad girl , aren 't you ? Psst , Bender ! What ? Oh , you ! - What are you doing here ? - Looking for you . We heard you were arrested as a human sympathizer . I was . They let me go when I said I killed a billion humans . Good ! Let 's get back to the ship . - What for ? - We 're rescuing you . - I don 't want that . - Say what ? I love this planet . I 've got wealth , fame ... ... and access to the depths of sleaze from that . But we 're your friends . Friends ? That activates my hilarity unit . I 'm a machine . You 're no more my friends ... ... than you are with the toaster , phonograph or electric chair . That 's not true . Well , that 's how it feels to me . Bye , Bender . I 'll miss you . Go on . Get out of here before you get caught . Bender , good news . Your album just went gold . - What the- - ? - It 's the humans ! Bender , do something ! Got you ! You murderous flesh piles ! Your Honor , I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5o / o of a doubt ... ... that these humans are guilty of the crime of being humans . Come to think of it , I rest my case . Thank you , prosecutor . I will now consider the evidence . Wait a minute . Won 't someone defend us ? Yeah ! He may not have a case , but I am genuinely not a human . Quiet , human ! He froze up again . Try control-alt-delete . - Jiggle the cord . - Turn him off and on . - Clean the mouse . - Call technical support ! Okay , okay , he 's back online . I find the defendants guilty . No ! Look , one eye ! Count them ! One ! Not human ! The humans are sentenced to live as robots live on Earth . They 'll perform tedious calculations and spot-weld cars ... ... until they become obsolete , and given to an inner-city school . Great work , Bender ! You 've taught us to hate humans all over again ! Heh-heh . Oh ... . [ SCREAMING ] [ THUDDING ] LEELA : Are you all right ? FRY : Oh , yeah . - Who are you ? - We are the Robot Elders . You don 't look old . Thanks . We try to take care of ourselves . - What 's going on ? - Silence ! Bring in Bender ! Make this quick . I 'm due at a mini-mall opening . Hey ! What is this ? Silence ! It 's time to kill the humans . But the judge sentenced us ! Silence ! That 's just a show for the public . We rule this planet . Handcarved from meteorites by robot founders over four centuries ago . Silence ! Come forward , Bender . You 'll have the honor of execution . Silence ! I concur . Here . Use the ceremonial kill-a-ma-gig . I 'm a little tired right now . Can I just give them a savage beating ? No ! The elders have spoken . Show us the killing skills that made you a media darling . Do it ! Kill them before they bring down our society ! - Do it ! - Do it ! ALL : Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Oh . [ GASPING ] I can 't kill them . Plenty of humans have mistreated robots , but not these two . They 're my friends . Humans are no threat to us . They 're stupid , putrid cowards . Damn right ! The fact is , humans are completely harmless . - We 're well aware of that . - You are ? We use them as scapegoats to distract the public from their real problems . Like our crippling lug nut shortage . And a corrupt government of robot elders . That 's for sure . Quiet , Jimmy . I 'm glad that 's out in the open . We 'll just let ourselves out . Silence ! You all know too much . Elders ? Execute function control , shift , kill . Stop ! Take one more step , and I 'll breathe fire on you ! He 'll do it ! He 's crazy ! Did we make that up ? Gee , I can 't remember anymore . It might be from that stupid movie . ROBOT ELDER : The original or the remake ? Hey ! They 're getting away ! FRY : So long , suckers ! Hello , suckers . Hold on . I forgot to deliver the package . Lug nuts ! Precious lug nuts ! Hooray for the humans ! I can 't believe you guys did this for me . This is the best Robanukah ever ! We want you to know that we respect your robot heritage . Thanks . You know I made Robanukah up to get out of work , right ? Of course . That doesn 't make it less meaningful . In that case , let the dancing begin ! [ HEBREW MUSIC PLAYS ] Hey , you guys are good . How the hell do you do that ? Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

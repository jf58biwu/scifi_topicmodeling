 Guys , I can 't go anotherfoot ! Come on , Miss wells , not underthe tree ! AII right , Mr. Brown , go ahead . You 're next . Now you go ahead ? Go ! Go ! AII right , here we go ! Oh-hh ! well , it ain 't Tahiti , but it sure beats 40 days and 40 nights of God 's vengeance on the wicked . Did anyone feel thatjolt as we entered the vortex ? Yeah , I thought one of you guys kicked me in the butt . Guys , where 's Quinn ? - Professor : He was right behind me . - Guys , I 'm over here . - Quinn ? - Q-BaII ? Quinn : Wade , Rembrandt ! Over here . - Professor : Mr. Mallory ? - Do you think he could 've missed the slide ? - Professor : Quinn ? - Rembrandt : Come on , man . This ain 't funny . - Quinn , over here ! - Quinn ? Professor : Mr. Mallory ! I 'm right here ! I 'm right here . What are you , deaf ? . Rembrandt : Doggone it , where are you , man ? Quinn ? Wade ... ? Mr. Mallory ! Rembrandt : I don 't see him over here ! Quinn ? ! Come on , Mr. Mallory ! Oh , my God . Quinn : What if you could travel to parallel worlds ? The same year , the same Earth , only different dimensions ? A world where the Russians rule America ? Or where your dreams of being a superstar came true ? Or where San Francisco was a maximum security prison ? My friends and I found the gateway . Now the problem is finding a way back home . ( theme music plays ) - Rembrandt : Hey , Q-Ball ! - Wade : Quinn ? Quinn ? Hey , Q-BaII ? Wade , don 't you hear me ? ! Professor : Mr. Mallory ? Come on , boy ! Any sign of him ? No . - You guys don 't hear me ? - Wade : I 'm really starting to get worried . I don 't believe this . Professor : Let 's not overreact . He 's probably landed somewhere else in the city- - it 's happened before . What if he didn 't ? Whoa- - what are you saying ? What if he got stranded back there in that miserable place ? - Don 't panic , now . - I am not panicking ! Look , he 's landed somewhere else . He 'II rendezvous with us , probably at the Dominion hotel . I don 't know , Professor . I mean , I 'm starting to get a weird vibe about this whole thing . Wade : How long are we on this world ? That 's odd . What 's the trouble now ? The timer 's not working . Let me see . It looks like it 's been scorched . Yes ... there 's been a short-circuit . The lightning could have created an electrical surge big enough to burn the whole thing out . And make me invisible ? This is unbelievable ! First Quinn and now this ! Miss wells , we 're all concerned about Quinn , but right now without the timer , we have no idea when we 're to depart this world . Repairing this is the first priority . Whoa- - what if we can 't repair it before it 's time to leave ? Then we may lose the window of opportunity , and for all of us- - wherever we are now is the end of the road . Great . Man : Oh , it 'sjust delicious . Try it . Rembrandt : well , I know this isn 't home . No . It 's more mid - ' 50s than late ' 90s . girl : Excuse me , mister . Can I see your horse ? Excuse me . Sirs , hi . hello , sir- - excuse me , miss ? Ma 'am- - ? You in the green hat ! Mr. Postman , hello ? Morning , mel . How are you ? Hi . Can you guys see me ? hello ? HeIIo- - ? Professor ... remind me what a vacuum tube is ? Attendant : Your oil 's fine , ma 'am . anything else ? It 's one of the technologies that existed before transistors . Right . I think we should find a pay phone and call the hotel in case Quinn 's trying to reach us . Good idea . Excuse me , Officer , could you tell us the way to the nearest public telephone ? It 's two blocks down on Geary . Thank you , sir . - ( horse whinnies ) - Easy , Jesse . Easy now . Hey , what 're you , blind ? ! Maybe we should grab a taxi and go to the hotel . It 's nearly rush hour . We probably wouldn 't get a taxi . Whoa , hold up there . Hey , I said stop . What 's that on your wrist ? I beg your pardon ? Turn around , face the street , put your hands above your head . - ( whinnies ) - Look , all we asked for was a pay phone . What 's the matter , man ? I 've never seen anything like this . It 's got numbers and no second hand . Where did you get this thing ? It certainly isn 't stolen ! You 're under arrest forthe possession of illegal material . Get out of here ! Get ! Professor : What are you talking about ? article 41 7- - violation of the anti-technoIogy statutes . Turn around and place your hands behind your back . - This is bad . - AII of you . - ( horse whinnies ) - Quinn : Get out of here ! - Go ! Go ! - Your horse ! Oh , Jesse ! Jesse ! Jesse , where you going ? Jeez ! Run , guys ! Wade : Come on , guys ! Let 's go ! Signature and out-of-state address on the line , please . What kind of world is it that would arrest you for wearing a watch ? Have there been any messages for us ? Any messages forthese nice folks ? No . Professor : Something 's strange about this telephone book . What 's that ? It goes from " electric " to " elevator " with nothing on " electronics " at all . It 's the same with " TV " - - no TV repair shops , TV suppliers , TV stations . Antique cars , old fashioned switchboards , no TV--this is all weird . ( laughs ) What 's so funny ? Oh , life , Mr. Brown . Here we are ... stuck in a world that 's in the technological Stone Age , with a timerthat 's broken that comes from the space age . What are we going to do ? This is no damn joke ! We 'IIjust pop out and find a computer store , shall we ? One moment . Excuse me , my friend . Can you direct me to the nearest computer store ? - I want a digital readout- - - Shh- - keep your voice down ! The Bureau of Anti-TechnoIogy would have my innkeeper 's license . Suite 304 , down the hall . You 've got to figure something out , guys . Getting out of here might be my only chance . There 's got to be some people here who are into technology . There 's a whole police force arresting folks for possession of it . excellent deductive reasoning , Mr. Brown . Thank you , sir . Now the question is ... how do we get in contact with people , who for reasons of their own survival are compelled to hide ? And who do we even trust ortaIk to ? Professor : You 're sure this was a good idea ? Rembrandt : Ifthere 's one thing I 've learned overthe years , there are only two people you can trust with a secret . That 's a lawyer and a priest , and a priest doesn 't charge you anything . I 'm going to say a prayerfor Quinn . I didn 't want to say anything to upset her , but between you and me , I have an awful feeling he 's stuck back on Rain world . ( organ music plays ) You can see me . You can , can 't you ? Go away ! gillian , what is it ? It 's not the voices again , is it ? I-I just need some air . Wait , you 've got to help me . Leave me alone ! - Leave me alone . - Quinn : Wait a minute ! Go away ! gillian : Leave me alone ! Quinn : Come back ! - Come back ! - Go ! Stop ! Come back ! Wait ! Wait a minute . Just explain this ! Leave me alone ! My mother will freak if she thinks I 'm talking to ghosts again . Stop . Stop . I 'm not a ghost ! I 'm flesh and blood ! I 've fallen into some kind of astral plane . You 've got to help me . Notjust me , but my friends , too . If they know I 'm okay , it won 't be so hard forthem . You 've got to get a message to them for me . Right- - " I just happened to be talking to a friend of yours on the astral plane . " You could hand them a note . They 'd have to believe you . Nobody even knows we 're here . please . Then will you leave me alone ? I promise . Do it , and you 'II never hearfrom me again . It 's amazing . They 're treating him like he 's some rock star . Woman : Thank you , Father . The absolution of sins is clearly big business on this world . Excuse me . Excuse me , Father . Woman : I was here first . From a friend . Thank you ! Rembrandt : What is it ? What 's in it ? " The lightning bolt altered my slide . I 'm alive and with you now , trapped on the astral plane . I 'm hoping we can re-unite once we slide out of here . Quinn . " Quinn ? ! Q-BaII 's here ? ! Rembrandt , no ! He 's here , Professor ! He 's alive ! " Astral plane " ? Young lady , please . please . Now you must tell me how you got that note . See ? They don 't believe me . I can 't help you . No ! You gave me your word .. You 're completely unfair ! He wants me to remind you of the time that you and he were ... necking in some basement , but then you came in . No ... ? He says , you walked in . Hmmm . How 's that ? gillian ? If I 'm going to drop you at the coffee shop , we ought to leave now . I wasjust coming , Mom . Wade : Explain that away , Professor . AII right , if we assume an infinite number of universes , then we have to assume an infinite number of sliders . That romantic interlude could 've been re-enacted here on this world , by your doubles . well , I believe he 's here . Quinn ? Quinn , where are you ? Miss wells , if he is on the astral plane , it 's a little futile engaging him in conversation . Keep talking , Wade . It makes me feel better . Look , what is this " astral plane " ? In theosophy , it 's thought to be the next level above the tangible worId- - kind of like another dimension . Okay , now ... if this lightning surge- - if it carried him there , wouldn 't our sliding out of here bring him back ? It might be my only chance , Rembrandt . That 's as it may be , but right now , mending this is the most important priority . Without this , we 're all stuck here . And there . May I , Professor ? . I 'II go see what I can find out . Excuse me , Father . I wonder if I couId have a word with you in private , if it 's possible ? certainly . I know what I 've told you is hard to believe ... but as God is my witness , it is the truth . travel between dimensions ? Most of my brethren would see the mere hypothesis as blasphemy , and my simply indulging this story no betterthan commerce with the devil . ( sighs ) please , can you help us ? I know this man through my work at the state prison . He 's free now , and despite my warnings , has returned to dabbling in the forbidden sciences . Why is this world so terrified of technology ? You 've heard of Hiroshima ? Yes . When its horrors were carefully studied , people concluded that technology would only hasten the apocalypse . technology was seen as the devil 's own handiwork and so it was banned . But everything here doesn 't look like 1940s technology . There have been some improvements , but it 's been very slow going . Father , this friend of yours , can he be trusted to keep our confidence ? I believe so . still , these are dangerous times . This is his address . His name is michael . But be carefuI- - the Bureau of Anti-TechnoIogy is quite good at its work . If they can catch you , I 'm not sure even God can help you . ( ' 50s rock music plays ) 316 Commonwealth . This is it . I sure hope you 're still with us , Q-BaII . I 'm still with you , Rembrandt . Yeah ? Oh , my God . Dad ... ? You 're Quinn MaIIory 's father , aren 't you ? My son is dead . Mr. MaIIory ... Father Jerry sent us . michael : What is so unbelievable is that my Quinn was full oftheories about inter-dimensional travel . I can 't say I encouraged him . OurtechnoIogy is so simple and what he was talking about was unsupportable . It still is . Mr. MaIIory , on our world , your son was a most accomplished inventor . And he 's well ? He 's healthy ? I 'm fine , Dad . But I miss you . Uh , he 's fine . He wanted to be with us , but he was ... busy inventing , you know ... Mr. MaIIory , how did your son die ? The polio . polio ? It 's epidemic . kills hundreds of thousands a year . Professor : And because of an irrational fear of science , a preventable disease is allowed to run rampant ? What ? You don 't have the polio in your world ? They developed a vaccine ages ago . ( sighs ) I , and others like me , have tried to make them see that technology is only as dangerous as the people who control it . We continue to lobby the Congress ... but this country is so fearful of the unknown . Mr. MaIIory , unless we repairthis timer soon , none of us will ever see our homes again . will you help us ? I spent five years in jail for having things like this . I don 't know if they 're any use to you , but you 're welcome to try . AII right , this bit 's done ... now the tour de force . The old microchip out ... and substitute the new microchip from my wristwatch . Very clever , Professor . ( sighs ) Right , now . Let 's have a little test here . This goes in that way , and ... tsk- - nothing ! It 's okay , Professor . We 're almost there . What ? You and Q-BaII ? ( laughs ) You and Q-Ball ! Look , it seemed like the world was coming to an end . We had to confront how we felt- - we talked , and we kissed . No big deal . Uh-huh . Damn it , Quinn , why did you have to kiss and tell ? Professor : All right . All ready for liftoffthis time . No ! No ! No , Professor- - the polarities are still reversed . Ow ! Damn ! Damn , how am I expected to work like this ? ! I 'm a theoretical physicist ! I work with universes , not piddling little stuff like this ! You can 't stop now , Professor , it 's right in front of you ! ( sighs ) I 've overlooked something . It 's probably elementary . Now let me think . What 's taking so long ? AII those voices in your head distracting you ? $ 2.50 , please . Keep the change . You might need it fortherapy . ( rings ) ( gasps ) I knew it ! I knew that you 'd break your promise ! gillian , I don 't know where else to turn . I don 't care . It 's not my problem . No , I can 't- - I can 't do this again . I can 't do it for you . I can 't do it for anybody . Look , find someone else to talk to yourfriends . I can 't . What are you so afraid of ? . ! They almost had me committed , okay ? She 's doing it again . gillian : You don 't know what they put me through ... No . Look at her . seriously . Okay ? It was really hard on my mom . ( laughter ) gillian , you want to explain this ? well , someone must have reached into the register when I wasn 't looking . There was close to a hundred dollars in here . It 's coming out of your pay . $ 100 ? Mrs. Henry , that 's not fair . With what I make , that 'll take six months to pay back . I 'm sorry , Gillian . I don 't know what else I can do . This cash register is your responsibility . Quinn : Hey ! gillian , it 's in here . I think that I know what happened , Mrs. Henry . Open your purse . Get lost , " psycho . " Hey ! That 's my Mom 's , you can ask her . Yes , I 'II do that . Why don 't you come to my office while I make the call ? Mrs. Henry ... can you get someone else to watch the counter ? . I have to run an errand . Come on . Professor : Give me something to Ieverthis . Thank you . I would give my eye-teeth for a Iong-nosed electrical pliers . ( yells ) That is not an electrical pliers ! That is a plumber 's wrench ! How the hell am I expected to rescue this boy with- - with equipment like this ? ! Look , nobody 's blaming you , Professor . ( whispers ) I wish Q-BaII were here . Yeah . Me , too . What 's that supposed to mean , eh ? The Professor 's not up to his student 's standards ? No , sir . That 's not what I mean . What did you mean ? well , damn it ! I 'm going out for- - some fresh air ! WeII- - what have we here ? - Wade : Who are you ? - Bureau of Anti-TechnoIogy . Sir , I realize there must be some small violation here , but this is of no use to you whatsoever . Ow ! well , once it 's melted down , it won 't be of use to anyone . Look , these people are innocent bystanders . I 'm responsible forthis . Now , please , don 't punish them for my mistakes . Easy does it ! Oh my God , it 's Anti-Tech . Quinn : They 've got my father ... and the timer . I 'm going inside . What am I supposed to do ? Are you talking to me ? Wait here . Wait ! I don 't have enough money to hold the cab . Hey , are you talking to me ? well , then let him go . I 'II be back as soon as I can . You must be talking to me because there 's nobody else here . Man # 1 : Any idea what it does ? Man # 2 : I can 't even tell you what it 's made of . I don 't need to remind you of the importance of this discovery . Any breakthrough will give us a huge leg up when Congress repeals the prohibitions . Wejust need four more votes to pass ... My God- - all this technology . ... and we can finally get to crank out this stuff . You mean , assuming they push it through . I 'II get it pushed through . If not , I 'II fire every lobbyist on the payroll . Rick , when Hobart gets in tomorrow morning , I want him to make this his number one priority . Oh , MaIIory ... ( laughing ) Nice work . Now , what 's the situation with those people ? basically , there 's a Iot more where that came from . They tell me the base of the device is made with some kind of pIastic- - a variation of a petroIeum-based polymer . Dad- - ! Man # 1 : Any idea where it came from ? Some cockamamie nonsense about " shadow Earths . " Anyway , they may be crackpots , but they seem more than eager to spill their guts . We need to start taking steps to protect against patent infringement claims like that . Don 't worry , once we get everything from them that we need , we 'II eliminate them . End of story . ( chuckles ) Rembrandt : This is it , huh ? This is where we spend the rest of our lives ? I 'm afraid so . Maybe one day I 'II be able to rebuild the timer , but not with this pile of prehistoricjunk ! ( knocking ) gillian . Hi . Quinn 's with me . He wants to tell you something . Is he okay ? Yeah , he 's fine , except he can be a little pushy . I tend to get that way in Iife-and-death situations . Where exactly is he ? Right here , Rembrandt . That chill you just felt- - Quinn touched you . Wow ! old people used to say that that was someone stepping on your grave . Quinn , they 've confiscated the timer . I know . He knows . tell them . He 's asked me to tell you his father knows the two men who took it . It 's a scam . It 's a scam . They work for- - Bayside Power and electric . - Bayside Power and electric . - What ? ! tell them about my father . His father 's going to milk you for as much information as he can ... And then kill them . ... then they plan to kill you . Quinn : Tell them where the timer is . The timer 's in some secret research lab at the power plant nearthe ... Embarcadero Center . Nearthe Embarcadero Center . tell them about the technology . Okay , I know ! Quinn says they 've got all sorts of modern technology hidden . I you can get in , you might find what you need . How does he suggest we do that , hm ? Hey , my boy ? Transform ourselves into a crack commando unit and raid the power company ? Ask him if he 's got a better idea . Rembrandt : What 's taking so long ? Professor : Making this type of device does take a little time , Mr. Brown . Well , time is what we 're going to be doing if we get caught , so hurry , up ! AII right , Mr. Brown . If you wedge this in overthere , make sure the beam hits exactly there . Now , what exactly does this do , Professor ? . well , this is a simple photovoltaic cell . I 'm using it as a switch ... into the fire alarm system . When the beam gets broken , the alarm will come on . ( chuckles ) AII right . That 'II do . Okay . ( chuckles ) I figure this should give them a certain measure of confusion . And in that confusion , we will go into the building . AII courtesy of Mike MaIIory . Not bad . Yes . shall we see if it works ? ( bell rings ) ( laughing ) ( siren wails ) Is this a false alarm again , or what ? Guard # 2 : I don 't know . ( muttering ) Come on , Professor . Let 's go . play it cool . cool it shall be , Mr. Brown . It 's locked ! Hmm . I Iove a weII-made barrel lock , Mr. Brown . AII those sensitive tumbIers awaiting the intimate caress of a precision-made key . You can pick it ? In a manner of speaking . Good man . Professor : Great heavens above ! Damn , it 's in pieces . Rembrandt : Think you can put it back together ? I don 't know . Come on , Professor , Iet 's get moving . Mr. Brown , there is no point in going unless we get what we came for . Man , somebody 's coming ! Let 's go ! Come on ! ( siren continues ) Guard : Damn ! Hey , fellas , we got a break-in ! Hurry , Mr. Brown ! Quinn ... what 's going to happen if they can 't get the timer back ? Then we 're all stuck here ... forever . Are you scared ? A little . well , if that happens , I just want you to know that if you need me , I 'II be around , so you can talk to yourfriends . Thanks . You 're really lucky , you know ? Lucky ? well , I know being stuck on an astral plane isn 't all that great , but at Ieast you have friends who care about you . I mean , take that from someone that has no friends . I can 't believe that . believe it . Nobody wants to hang around with a weirdo . That 's why I tried to ignore you . I didn 't want people making fun of me again . gillian , those people , they only do that because ... they 'rejust afraid of what they don 't understand . I know , but it still hurts . You have a gift . call it ESP , call it some kind of heightened perception- - it 's a miracle . And I don 't think whoever or whatever gave you that gift would ever want you to throw it away . You 're amazing . Rememberthat . Thanks . Life is so weird , you know ? I mean , you 're the first real friend that I 've had , and I can 't even hug you . Where are they ? They should 've been back by now . I should 've been home an hour ago , you know . Maybe I should call my mom again . You already called once . Another excuse is going to raise suspicions . We got it ! This is great ! congratulations are a little premature , Miss wells . There are only two places that we know of on this planet where we can find the necessary bits and pieces to fix this . And we cannot go back to the power station . What are you saying ? We have to go back to Mike MaIIory 's ? only if you wish to slide again . gillian ... ? Oh , no , Wade , it 's okay . I want to help . It might be dangerous . well , for you , too . Rembrandt : Okay then , let 's do it . M.C. : Our next contestant is Miss Oregon . A student at Beaver College , she 's studying veterinary medicine . Folks , I wish you could see her . A curvaceous Oregonian fills out herturquoise swimsuit with an eye-catching 35-24-36 frame . I 'II ring five . Oh , to be a sick puppy at the hands ofthis ... Rembrandt : The beauty pageant 's on the radio . gillian . Mom ? Mrs. mitchell ? So you are the mother of this truly remarkable young lady . I am Professor MaximiIIian Arturo and your daughter is assisting us- - in an extremely important research project . gillian , get in the car . No . Do as yourtoId ! A man is trapped in the astral plane and I 'm the only one that can help him ! This is insane ! But it 's true ! I 'm not crazy ! And if you love me , then you 'II give me a chance to prove it . Professor : Madam , I beg you- - this truly is a matter of Iife or death . Let mejust show you what I can do . Mom , please ? Professor : The house is empty . There 's no telling when he 'II be back . Quick , Mr. Brown , you do the honors . AII right . Mr. MaIIory , will you kindly tell this young lady what it is exactly you want me to do ? I couId forgive this nonsense coming from young people , but you should know better . Madam , I know it sounds fantastic , but somehow nature has given your daughterthe ability to see and hear a being on another dimension . Now , watch and learn . He says that you need to reverse the polarities on the spectrometer , The microchip 's not the problem . Easier said than done . I don 't have anything fine enough to do it . Does anyone have a toothpick or- - a paper clip ? Hmmm ? Hmmm ? That would be ironic , wouldn 't it ? " For want of a shoe , the war was lost . " Hmmm ? would my brooch pin do ? Madame , that would do perfectly . Thank you . Right . What else ? He says , " Cross yourfingers . " AII right . ( beeping ) - Ah ! - Yes ! Rembrandt : You 're beautiful , man ! You 're beautiful ! Thank you , man , thank you . 1 7 seconds and counting ! Nobody 's going anywhere . Give it here , sir . I cannot believe that a man who would bring up a boy like Quinn could do this . I have no choice . I owe my freedom to Bayside Power . They got me out ofjaiI early . Come with us , MaIIory ! A man shouIdn 't live unappreciated in this world . Let me show you how technology can change things . This is a trick ! Shut it off ! I can 't . That gateway will remain open for 60 seconds , then it will shut by itself . - I said , shut it off ! - Dad , no ! Stop ! Quinn ? ! Professor : Good heavens ! He 's being illuminated by energy from the vortex ! Let them go . Put the gun down . This is an illusion ! My son is dead ! I am not the Quinn you knew , but I am your son- - and I don 't believe you 'd hurt innocent people . 45 seconds to closure . Come on , Q-BaII , Iet 's go . I can 't , Rembrandt . The vortex isn 't active on the astral plane . You 've got to go without me . Professor : He 's right . Go . I Iove you , man . I Iove you too , " Crying Man . " Mr. MaIIory , we will find a world where there 's technology and I promise I will come looking for you . Goodbye , my boy . This is the hardest thing that I 've ever done . Thank you , Professor . I 'm not going to leave you . This is no time to be noble , Wade . There 's nothing you can do for me here . The next slide might take you home . Go , before it 's too late . Go ! Go ! Damn you . Is he still here ? Quinn ? Quinn ? The vortex ! It 's passing through the astral plane ! I can slide ! Thank you . tell him I 'II always love him . ( portal closes ) ( thumplng , rustling ) Q-BaII ? ! Quinn ... ? ( sighs ) Professor : Welcome back , Mr. Mallory ! So , you think we 're home ? Quinn : I don 't think so , Rembrandt . I 'm pretty sure on our Earth , the mailmen wear clothes .

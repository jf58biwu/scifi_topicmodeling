 No , I didn 't say that . Henry , you sent us 15 pounds of flounder . No , I didn 't say that . No , I keep telling you , this is a bar and grill . I don 't see your girlfriend going out with anyone but yourself . We only serve steak , chicken , chicken , steak , that 's it . There 's a big difference there . No . No , I keep telling you . I didn 't say no one would go out with your girlfriend . What I said was , I can 't see your girlfriend going out with anyone but you . It does not taste like chicken . Look , I may be blind but I 'm not stupid . Can you hold on a sec ? ALEX TREBEK : A famous 1924 campaign slogan was " Keep cool with this man . " Herbert Hoover . Calvin Coolidge . TREBEK : Rita . RITA : Who is Calvin Coolidge ? Yes . Hail to the Chief for $ 800 , please . Show off . TREBEK : Answer : Daily Double . Not , no , not your girlfriend , Jimmy . MARISSA : Great . No problem . You wouldn 't believe my day , I 'll tell you . Sewer exploding at 12 : 00 , then I gotta run over , and I gotta stop a monkey from freezing to death . Can you believe that ? 3 : 00 today . No , today . It 's gotta be today . Why would I think your girlfriend is a show-off ? There 's nothing I can do with it . I got a monkey that 's a mascot . It 's stinking up my freezer , Henry . Kid leaves the door open in the cage . It 's gotta go . It 's gotta go . All these other little kids screaming and hollering about the misfortune of Mikey the Monkey . TREBEK : He was the last of three men to serve as president in 1881 . Millard Fillmore . Chester Arthur . CONTESTANT : Who is Chester Arthur ? TREBEK : You are correct . After Garfield . How did she do that ? Okay . " Actors and Actresses " for $ 200 . No , get it out of here . It was nice talking to you . Put it in the Dumpster . Why are you so concerned about what I think about Gina ? I don 't go out with her . I 'm trying to work with you . I 'm sticking it in the Dumpster . CHUCK : Saving the world : It 's not always as glamorous as it sounds . Some days you 're running through burning buildings , saving lives . Other days , you 're searching the city for a lost monkey . Some mornings , you wonder why you even bothered to get out of bed . So , how do you save the world ? I guess you try not to think too much and just do it one monkey at a time . ( grunting ) ( monkey screeching ) Mikey ? Mikey ? ( monkey chatters ) Here , monkey , monkey , monkey . ( monkey squeals ) ( groans ) For Pete 's sake . The things I gotta do . I gotta chase a monkey around town . Hey , monkey ! ( monkey screeching ) Mikey ? I 'm talking to you , Mikey . All right , I hear you . ( monkey squealing ) Hold on , I 'm coming . Okay , where 'd you go ? Is that you out on that catwalk , buddy ? Hey , come on . Don 't make me come out there . Mikey ? ( chattering ) ( loud crashing , Gary screaming ) GARY : Oh ! Somebody help ! Mikey ! Anyone ! I could use a little help here ! ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * ( rooster crows ) Hmm , that 's interesting . It says here they 're gonna close the Food World down the street . Mm-hmm . Um , they 're opening one of those Bargain Barn superstores . Mm ... It says here it should open next March . Hon ? Hmm ? I 've already read the paper . Oh . Well , you just have to say so . I just did . ( cat meows ) ( newspaper thuds ) ( meows ) Huh ? Weird . It 's Gary 's paper . Do you have any idea what time it is ? Yeah , it 's about two minutes after the last time you asked me , which makes it , what ? 8 : 47 . Mm-hmm . Look , Chuck , I know you 're worried , but Gary 's ... Worried ? I am not worried . I am annoyed . Annoyed ? Yeah . We are running a business here , okay ? I have things to discuss with Gary ; business things . And I think it 's a little careless of him not to at least leave a note , you know ? " Back in ten minutes . Back next week . " Back next year . I am never coming back " . Whatever . Mm-hmm . You 're worried . I am not ... ( phone rings ) Gary ? Chucko , is that you ? Who is this ? Bernie . Bernie Hobson . Bernie ? Bernie , I can barely hear you . Gotta keep my voice down . These walls have ears . Uh , nothing . Nothing at all . Don 't give me " nothing " . Where 's Gary ? He 's ... out . That 's what I was afraid of . I got the paper ! You what ? That 's right , the paper , the furball , the whole nine yards , right here on my front porch . ( whispering ) : Bernie got his paper . Are you sure it 's tomorrow 's ? Of course I 'm sure . It 's right here in black and white . Now where 's Gary ? We don 't know . He didn 't show up this morning . He didn 't call , he didn 't write , nothing . All right , all right , keep your pants on . I got the grey ghost all gassed up and I 'm on my way . I 'll be there in 180 minutes . 170 if the bladder holds up . We 're going on a trip . ( sotto voce ) : I can 't believe he got the paper . ( sniffing ) Bernie ? Sorry , hon . You need the potty ? What are you doing ? You know , you gotta give it to these commies . They make a hell of a cigar . We 've talked about this . What 's that ? Smoking in the house . Are you kicking me out ? What ? ! Are you giving me the boot ? I didn 't . I just ... All right , I get the message . You don 't have to tell Bernie Hobson twice . Ten-four . ( toilet flushes ) Over and out . Bernie , what is the matter with you ? You don 't want me stinking up the house with my fumes , fine , But ... You cannot unsay what 's already been said . Where did that cat come from ? Bye , Lois . Where are you going ? So he came down to the bar before he left for the day , but he didn 't tell you where he was going ? You know , I-I don 't remember . I mean , Chuck was on the phone , I was on the phone . Didn 't you hear anything he said , Chuck ? I didn 't even know he was there , okay ? Brilliant . Heads up , sports fans ! Bernie 's back ! Bernie ! Chucko ! What are you doing here ? 150 miles ? How 'd you get here so fast ? Good lane choices and proper metabolic management . Marissa . Hey , Bernie . It 's been too long , hmm . Have we met ? Briefly . All right , enough idle chitchat . We got a crisis here . Yeah . What am I missing ? Somebody fill me in . That 's all we know . And we haven 't heard from him since yesterday . Strange . Uh , may I , please ? Hands off the paper ! What did the cops say ? We didn 't call the cops . Well , why the hell not ? Get me a phone . CRUMB : Waste of time . Excuse me ? The cops can 't do anything till someone 's been missing for 48 hours . And what are the facts here ? We got a good-looking kid who didn 't come home last night . What I 'm saying here is that it 's not beyond the realm of human possibility that the young man is out having himself a good time . MARISSA : You-you mean Gary ? The man is a monk . Wait a minute . He 's right . The kid 's a chip off the old block . He 's a Hobson . He 's got my genes . He 's got my glands . I 've been there myself . But , um , Gary 's so responsible . The man leaves a message if he goes to the john . It 's obvious the kid is out racking up some RRs and he 's lost touch of time . Now , the paper has chosen me to pinch hit for him . See this story ? CHUCK : " Suicide jumper leaps ... " Somebody out there needs me . Why you ? Why not me ? Why don 't I take the paper while you stay here and wait for Gary to call ? If anybody should fill in for Gary , it should me moi , not toi . Chucko , the paper came to me . I 'm his best friend . I 'm his old man ! Okay , partners . Forget it . Come on , Bern . It 'll be fun . Just you and me , pal . Yeah , sure . You can wait in the car . Oh , boy . Jerzy ? Jerzy Carpathian ? How do you know my name ? Don 't do this . Who are you ? Bernie . I 'm your friend . No ! Don 't come any closer ! Come closer , I jump . I swear , I do it ! This is not the answer . That 's it ? That 's all you got ? You , you climb up onto ledge with suicidal man , and all you have to offer is , " This is not the answer " ? Okay , okay . How about , " Things aren 't as bad as they look " ? How do you know ? You don 't know . For all you know , things are worse than they look ! Ten times worse than they look ! CHUCK : Then go ahead and jump ! Oh , no . JERZY : Who is he ? His name is Chuck Fishman . He 's a major pain in the ass . I thought I told you to stay downstairs . And miss this ? Are you crazy ? Go on , do it . And do a ... do a somersault on your way down . We 'll even give you a score . What the hell are you doing ? It 's called tough love . ( whispers ) : I saw it in a Clint Eastwood movie . This is my gig , Fishman . Now , butt out . JERZY : Just leave me alone . It 's about a girl , isn 't it ? No . She threw you out of the house . Changed all the locks . Told you she needed her space . It 's not girl . It 's , it ... It 's a guy ? That 's okay . Chicago 's a very open city . We all watch that show Ellen . I should have gone to bridge . I thought the roof would be more private . Who comes to roof ? Jerzy ! Let 's talk about this ! Bernie ! ( screaming ) And then , kaboom . Splat . The two of ' em , liquefied all over the pavement . What ? Yeah . Well , that 's what would have happened , if the rescue squad hadn 't shown up with that giant air mattress . ( Bernie screaming ) I don 't like this ! You called them , didn 't you ? Well , yeah , I did . I mean , I figured between you and Bernie , that jumper didn 't have a chance . Where 's Bernie , anyway ? ( Bernie laughing ) It 's all right , people . It 's all right . No need to panic . Everything is under control . Get this man away from me ! This man is lunatic ! He should be on medication ! BERNIE : Nothing unusual here . Just a concerned citizen looking out for his fellow man . All right , buddy ... You know what they say : It takes a village ... Uh-huh . Name , please ? Bernie . Bernie Hobson . " H " , as in hero , " O " ... What were you doing on the roof , Mr. Hobson ? What do you mean , what was I doing on the roof ? What did it look like I was doing on the roof ? To tell you the truth , looked like you pushed that fella off the roof . Are you kidding me ? ! I saved that fellow 's life ! Jerzy ? Jerzy , tell this guy . I saved your life , right ? Crazy man ! Stay away from me ! Crazy man ! MARISSA : So he was arrested ? Why didn 't you bail him out ? I tried . I went down to the station house . I couldn 't find him . He 's deep in the bowels of the system . Basic intake . They give him a number , take his picture , take his prints , check him for priors , de-louse him for head lice . Then you can bail him out . Whole thing takes about eight hours . Thank you for sharing . Gary disappears , Bernie 's arrested . ( sighs ) What 's next ? ( cat meows , paper thuds ) ( meows ) Hi , little guy . Are you lost ? Where did you come from ? Make yourself at home . GARY : Can anybody hear me ? ! Somebody ? Hello ? ( rumbling ) Oh , no . Oh ! Need a little help here ! Excuse me . I 'm looking for my husband , Bernie Hobson . I need to know his condition , and which hospital you sent him to . Ma 'am , I don 't know who you 're talking about . My husband , Bernie Hobson . He was shot here yesterday . I know it 's a big city ... OFFICER : Nobody was shot here . But it says so right here in the newspaper . Lois ? Bernie ! Are you all right ? What are you doing here ? Oh , are you okay ? They said you got shot . Shot ? I didn 't get shot . Who said I got shot ? It said so . It was front page story . What story ? Right here in the Chicago Sun-Times . Are you in some sort of trouble ? Does it say who shot me ? Um , a vagrant , a kook . I don 't know . I didn 't read it that closely . I mean , honestly , Bernie , sometimes I don 't think I know you anymore . You don 't tell me where you 're going . You sign us up for a Chicago newspaper , and you get shot , you don 't call ... Gun ! Get down , Lois ! ( gunshot ) BERNIE : He 's got a gun ! He 's got a gun ! Get his gun ! You all right ? I 'm fine . You ? Right as rain . But the paper said ... We should talk . Our son gets tomorrow 's newspaper today ? And a cat . I know it 's a lot to wrap your mind around- - the future , the past , this whole time and space thing- - but ... but if you sit with it for a little bit , and start thinking about it , you 'll ... And you 've known about this for how long ? Well , for about a year . You know , since the last time I visited Gary . And during that time , you didn 't say a thing . Not one word . Wait a minute . Is that what 's bothering you ? I 'm your wife , Bernie . Granted . But what about the fact that it 's impossible to get tomorrow 's paper today ? Doesn 't that just shake you up a hair ? An eeny-teensy-weensy bit ? No . I find a lot of things in this world incomprehensible , but my husband shouldn 't be one of them . Come on , Lois . I can 't believe you didn 't tell me . He 's my son , too . I know . I know . Oh , no . You had to just go off and have your own little adventure alone . Any excuse to leave the house . Come on , Lois , don 't start that . This has become a pattern with you , Bernie . It is not a pattern . This is not like any other time . This is about our son . Exactly ! Our son . Now , do you think , if I found out that our son could predict the future , that I would hold that back from you ? Well , I ... Uh-uh , answer the question . I didn 't think you could handle it . Mrs. Hobson , what about your husband ? Aren 't you gonna post bail ? Keep him . Uh-oh . Mrs. Hobson , how are you ? It 's good to see you . Chuck , how long have you known ? Known about what ? The paper . How long ? I don 't believe this . Everybody 's getting it but me . You 've known about this from the very start , haven 't you ? It 's Gary 's fault . He wouldn 't let me tell anyone . I wanted to . I begged him . I pleaded . I said , " Gary , at least tell your mother . She deserves it , " I said . But he wouldn 't listen to me . You know how stubborn he could be . Chuck , I have this condition . The doctors call it " crap intolerant " . I can only take so much B.S. before I explode . ( Crumb laughs ) ( stops laughing ) Does my son pay you to mix drinks , or smirk at the customers ? A little of both . Can I get you something ? Yeah . How about a Over Under Indian Leg Breaker ? You think you can whip up one of those ? Is that with oregano , or without ? With . Marion Crumb . Lois Hobson . Pleased to meet you . CHUCK : So we told Bernie the whole story , and he said not to worry , that Gary probably met someone . Who ? You know , a girl , or something like that . Well , that 's what he said . He said , you know Gary , he 's just a chip off the old block . And you believed him ? Yeah . A guy answering Gary 's description was seen on the corner of Broadway and , uh , Lawrence a couple days ago . Apparently , he was directing traffic around a fuel spill . CHUCK : Sounds like Gary . A friend of mine 's a detective in the 13th . He 'll meet us there in about an hour . Do you know a , a bar the , uh , Green Mill ? Yeah . What about it ? Is that on the way ? Yeah . Why ? CHUCK : Could you ... Could you just give us a second , please ? ( whispering ) : He doesn 't know ? He has no idea . Now , let me see . " Barroom brawl leaves one ... " So , uh , this is the way Gary does it , right ? He just , he finds a story , and then he goes ? That 's it . ( chuckles ) Well , I have to admit , it 's a bit exciting . It 's thrilling . Who wants a piece of Anatoly ? Prepare to suffer the wrath of the angry Carpathian . ( grunting ) ( glass shattering ) Hey ! Uh-oh . All right , you guys have had your fun . Game 's over . It 's a cop , Jimbo . Come on , put the little guy down . CRUMB : Come on . Fine . He 's down . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . Come on . What 's the matter with you guys ? Get out of here . And you ... What the hell were you thinking of ? ( gasps ) Nobody calls Anatoly Carpathian " little guy . " Fine , you want to stop someplace else , or we go find your son ? So , Jerzy , let me in on the secret . Why 'd you do it ? Why did you jump ? You ever hear of " The Four Carpathians " ? No . That is why . Nobody has heard of us . So what are you , a circus act , or something ? Aerialists . My brothers and me . We did the trapeze , the high wire , and the spectacular Carpathian catapult , on which patent is pending . Hey , that sounds great . Back home in Latvia , we are the hope of our village . They send us to America to become famous so that we can send money back home , so there can be hospitals , schools , maybe even video store . They say , " Go . Go , share your gifts with the world . " The world doesn 't want our gift . They want tiger , they want dancing girls ... They want clowns ! Always clowns . Little men who paint faces . ( honking ) We make no money . Still , our village suffer . But we Carpathians , we are hearty people . We keep trying . Until one year ago , Tuesday , my brother Karl announce he 's quitting . No ! He 's going to California . He has new dream . Wants to be in commercials . Wants to be man to say , " Got Milk ? " on TV . We say , " Go . " Get milk ! We 'll succeed without you . " Well , four Carpathians , failure . Three Carpathians , big failure . Our big mistake is , we don 't stick together . It 's like they say in my village . " Carpathian ... ( speaking Latvian ) ... Carpathian . " ( laughing ) You lost me there , Jerz . Translated means , " For one Carpathian to fly ... " ANATOLY : " All Carpathians must fly . " Anatoly ! Jerzy ! My brother ! My brother ! ( loud kisses ) ( in unison ) : Ha ... ( rhythmic grunting ) ( laughing ) : Hey ! Fate has brought us together again ! Anatoly , I feel like I know you . Who is this man ? This man , this man , he saved my life . He is like brother to me . Brother ! Brother ! Ow . Oh ... I 'm working on it . I 'm working on it . Please , work more . DETECTIVE : Take it easy , Crumb . Good luck . Three eyewitnesses put Gary here day before yesterday . None of them saw where he went . So what now ? Well , let 's get some copies made of Gary 's picture . We 'll get lucky ; you 'll see . Marion ... that man . CRUMB : Yeah ? What about him ? The scarf . That 's Gary 's scarf . You sure ? Yeah . I made it for him three years ago . It 's Gary 's . Hey , buddy , hold up . Hang on a second . Oh , come on . Hey ! I don 't believe this ! Come on , stop ! Hold it ! Are you okay ? Is this his ? Yeah . Don 't worry . We 'll find him . GARY : Cat ? Is that you ? Cat ? ( cat meowing ) ( plaster cracking , metal creaking ) ( gasps ) ( cat meowing ) Well , don 't just stand there . Why don 't you go get some help , huh ? ( meows ) I 'm looking for a monkey , and I 'm talking to a cat . BERNIE : No , it seems to me that you guys have a marketing problem . Have you ever tried direct mail ? Who can afford postage ? Bernie , hey ! How you doing ? Hey , Chucko ! Good to see you ! I 'm getting out . You got my bail ? Uh , no . But I got your lunch . Gnocchi . Your favorite . You 're not bailing me out ? I wanted to , Bern , but it actually ... It-it wasn 't up to me . Lois . Yeah . She gave me specific instructions that under no circumstances was I to bail you out . She was pissed , Bernie . And when that woman is mad , she is scary . I 'm sorry . Oh , you don 't have to tell me . My advice ? Apologize . I can 't do that . Sure you can . Just tell her that whatever you did , you 're sorry . That you were wrong . I was not wrong ! Okay , fine . It 's none of my business . Enjoy your lunch . Hey . Did he apologize ? Not in so many words , but he was thinking about it . I-I could tell . You could see it in his eyes . Listen , I-I really think you should reconsider . I mean , you should see his cellmates . I think they put him in the psycho ward . He 'll survive . You 're a tough cookie , Lois . " Shot by a convenience store clerk , the robber , Fyodor Carpathian , died at the scene . " Carpathian . Why do I know that name ? Yeah , can I help you ? Give me all your money . Whoa , whoa . Easy there . What do you think you 're doing , man ? This is a ... Excuse me.I 'm looking for some deodorant . I do not work here . The roll-on kind , about this big , musk-scented . Lois , why don 't you just let me ... Like the one you have under your shirt . What ? He 's holding me up with antiperspirant ? That is lame . I do not know what you are talking about . Get away . Fyodor ... How do you know my name ? Drop the deodorant . No . I need money . You 're gonna get hurt . I do not care . My brothers are in jail . They count on me to bail them out . ( sighs ) Fyodor , let me ask you one question . If your mother were here , what would she say ? She would say , " This is no way for Carpathian to act . " Go ahead , call police . Look , buddy , why don 't you just move along . I want to go to jail . I want to be with my brothers . Fyodor , this is America . You only go to jail if you commit a crime . Well ? What about now ? Careful . Easy does it . There you go ! This is what we call the " Tower of Carpathia . " What do we do now ? Now ... We sing . we sing . * Give me land , lots of land under starry skies above * ALL : * Don 't fence me in * * Let me ride through the wide open country that I love * ( solo ) : * Don 't fence me in . * Brothers , have you replaced me already ? Fyodor ! Fyodor ! It is like family reunion , right here in American prison . What a country . CARPATHIANS : Brother ! ( loud kisses ) ( in unison ) : Ah ! ( rhythmic grunting ) ( laughing ) Brother ! ( grunting ) Ow ! Ahh ! Slow learner . Geez ! Tell me the truth . In your professional opinion , do you think something 's happened to Gary ? Don 't take this the wrong way , now . Your kid is ... a little different . Strange-Strange things seem to happen when he 's around . I 'm-I 'm-I 'm getting used to that . You didn 't answer my question . You want to know what I think ? Someone , or something is looking out for that kid . I mean , he 'll be fine . You 'll see . Oh , I feel like I 'm trespassing , it 's been so long . So , you-you don 't visit a lot , huh ? We 've drifted . The whole family . I think we 've been drifting ever since Gary left home . Are you married , Mr. Crumb ? Was . Evelyn died 13 years ago . Lung cancer . Did you and Evelyn ... Did you ever run out of things to talk about ? Not yet . You know , Bernie and I , we 've been married a very long time . I think we 're falling apart . I think he 's bored with me . Oh , I couldn 't buy that . You 're not the kind of woman that men become bored of . That-that-that 's my-my professional opinion . ( knocking at door ) Phone call . Gary 's credit card turned up on a trace . How long ago ? It 's being used right now . Okay , you got ten pre-washed , ten stone-washed , ten unwashed , loose-fit , easy-fit , and you want these . Baggy-fit . Very big with the kids . Yes . I 'm just waiting on an authorization on your credit card . Computer 's slow . Do you have your driver 's license on you , Mr. Hobson ? Oh , I 'm sure he does . But it 's not his . You Gary Hobson ? Yes . Yes , I am . I 'd like you to meet your mother . ( meowing ) I don 't care if you stole it , okay ? I don 't care if you ripped off a ... a busload of nuns . All I want to know is , where did you find the wallet ? This is getting old , friend . We got a guy out there , he 's been missing for a couple days now . He might be hurt . He might be worse than hurt . And all I got to work with is you . Listen , you don 't realize how lucky you are . The only reason you 're sitting here instead of in the station house right now is because I 've got a couple of good friends down there . Now , I need to know where you found the wallet , and I need to know now . ( growling ) Where 's Bernie ? Well , I meant to bail him out , I really did . I mean , we 're very close to finding Gary . Bernie should be here , but ... What happened ? Well , he gave me an ultimatum . He said he wouldn 't let me bail him out unless I bailed out his friends , too . Yeah , but what friends are you talking about ? The Carpathian brothers . Hello . So what are you gonna do about your husband ? Well , I only had enough money for three . It was an easy choice- - I hate ultimatums . How 's it going ? Oh , the man is a vault . Nothing gets in , nothing gets out . I think we 're gonna have to hand him over . Anatoly , Fyodor , look who it is ! I don 't believe it ! Karl ! Brother ! Brother ! Brother ! Brother ! Brother ! ( loud kisses ) Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! ( rhythmic grunting ) ( laughter ) JERZY : You make it to California ? Did you get milk ? I got as far as Arizona . Saw Grand Canyon . Had epiphany . It is brothers who matter . I have been looking for you ever since . So you got a voice after all . And what are you doing here ? We caught him with a stolen credit card . I was buying jeans for the entire village . CRUMB : Ask him where he found the damn wallet . Is true , Mrs. Hobson ? Karl steal wallet ? Well , he did have my son 's credit card . We just need to know where he found the wallet , Jerzy . My son 's missing- - we need Karl 's help . I ask him . Karl ... ( speaking Latvian ) ( speaking Latvian ) He say he-he find the wallet on the sidewalk in front of theater , just sitting there . ( chuckles ) : He thought it was gift from God . He ... he no rob anybody . He not even see anybody . Can you take us there ? Uh , Karl , uh ... ( speaking Latvian ) ... a woman ? Da . We go now ? Yeah . Okay , look , I 'll , uh , I 'll stay here , and I 'll wait in case Gary calls , and you ... Come on , let 's get going here . We got a damn booby hatch . ( grunting ) Anyone in here ? LOIS : Gary ? We got to find some lights . JERZY : Brothers , look at this place ! ANATOLY : Big theater ! FYODOR : What is that smell ? CRUMB : Hobson ! You in here ? LOIS ( calls ) : Gary ? GARY : Mom ? I 'm up here . There he is ! I see him ! JERZY : It 's him ! It 's Gary Hobson ! How 'd he get up there ? GARY : You got to get me down . Gary ? I think I 'm in trouble here . LOIS : Just sit tight , honey . Hope they still work . ( yells ) Lights come on ? You 're gonna be all right . CRUMB : Don 't worry , we 'll get you down . Uh , good . But you 'd better hurry up , 'cause I think this thing is about to fall . JERZY : This is trouble . Son , son , just d-don 't move . Well , th-that 's great advice , Mom . I heard that . GARY : Oh , I 've been trying not to move here for two days ! Look , we got to get somebody up there , but how ? We need a rope , a ladder . We need to stack something up . It must be 20 feet up there . We need a catapult or something . Did someone say catapult ? Yes . The Carpathian brothers are here to help ! Come on , brothers , let 's get to work ! Oh , dear . ( voice cracks ) : What 's going on down there ? ANATOLY : Jerzy , over here ! LOIS : Just hold on , Gary . It 's , it 's under control . We 'll use these seats . JERZY : Anatoly , quickly- - every second counts ! ( " Saber Dance " playing ) Okay , ready . CARPATHIANS : Brothers ! Who 's that ? Don 't worry , hon . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! ( rhythmic grunting ) ( all grunt ) JERZY : Ladies and gentlemen , The Four Carpathians ! Oh , my , they 're good . Karl , you are up . What 's going on down there ? Jerzy , more height . I will need a volunteer from the audience . You , sir , how much do you weigh ? Excuse me ? Come on , you 're not going to make me guess , are you ? Uh , 210 , 220 . All right , 250 . Perfect . What do I got to do ? You get on Karl 's shoulders , you jump , I fly . No , no , I don 't jump . Okay , I get on Karl 's shoulders , I jump , you fly . ( Lois gasps , Gary yells ) Jerzy . Marion ! All right , all right , I 'll jump . Very good . Very easy . LOIS : Quickly ! Up you go . Ladies and gentlemen , please put your hands together for ... CRUMB : Hey , hey , hey ! Let 's just get on with it , huh ? JERZY : Easy , easy . Hold steady , now , policeman . Hey , come on , what 's going on ? Now ! Got you ! LOIS : Oh , my ! Do you think this is gonna work ? Oh , don 't worry , I 've seen this done a million times- - it 'll work . LOIS : You 're kidding , right ? JERZY : Two steps forward . Pleased to meet you , Gary- - my name 's Jerzy . JERZY : All right ... turn around three steps . ANATOLY : Turning ... three steps . LOIS : It 's coming down ! Gary . What ? You slide , I catch . I slide ? What , are you nuts ? LOIS : Oh ! Okay , I 'll slide . Easy . Come on , trust me . LOIS : Be careful with him . Easy . That 's good . I slide ? ( Lois gasps ) Problem , Gary , problem ! Gary ... Jerzy must see ! Huh ? Jerzy must see . ANATOLY : We got him ! Okay . All right , brothers , get ready to dismount . GARY : Dismount ? One ... Dismount ? ! two ... three ! Whoa ! Hey ! Hey ! ( laughter ) ( sighs ) Thanks . Are you all right ? Oh , God . Yeah , yeah , yeah , I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Oh , we 've got to get you home . We 've got to clean you up . I 'll get you some good , hot soup . Wouldn 't that be good ? Yeah , that will be great . Where 's Dad ? Uh , Dad . Uh ... Who are they ? Uh , you know what , son ? Let 's talk about all that on the way home . Okay ? The important thing is that you 're alive . JERZY : You 're good , you 're good . New Carpathian . Carpathian hug . Oh , no . CARPATHIAN : Brothers ! ( loud kisses ) ( in unison ) : Oh ... ! ( rhythmic grunting ) ( all laughing ) I yelled until I was hoarse . Now , I 'll tell you , it was a very good performance . Yeah , well , in the future , when you see signs saying , " Do not enter , " remember : they 're there for a reason . Yeah ... yeah , all this because of a monkey . MARISSA : Well , you made a lot of kids happy , Gary . Oh , great . And some kid found the monkey and returned it to school . See that , Gare ? In the primate world , you 're still number one . CRUMB : All right , what do you say we get out of here , let the kid get some rest ? Come on . All right . You get some rest . You deserve it , you little monkey lover , you . Sleep well . ( hooting like a monkey ) Hey , Crumb . Yo . Hey , listen , my ... my parents , they ... What about them ? They seem all right to you ? What do you mean ? Well , I mean , they ... they ... they seem , uh ... Listen . Your parents are fine . They were just worried about you- - that 's all . Trust me . They 'll be okay . Get some rest . Hey , Crumb . Yeah . Thanks . ( door closing ) Don 't let me down , now . What 's that all about ? Come on , Lois , you haven 't said two words to me since you bailed me out . Oh , you want to talk now . What 's that supposed to mean ? Every morning since you 've been retired , you could have talked to me then . Every night , I lay right beside you in bed . You could have talked to me then , but you had to ... read your books and your magazines and ESPN . You want to talk now . Well , maybe I don 't want to listen . Fine . You don 't want to listen ? I 'm going to tell you anyway . You were right all along . I did want to have an adventure on my own . I should have told you about Gary and the newspaper , but ... You didn 't think I could handle it . Nah , that 's a load of crap . I have never seen you in a situation you couldn 't handle . You 're the most capable woman I ever met . Bernie , what is it ? What 's going on ? What 's going on is that ... you 're better at this kind of thing than I am . What kind of thing ? Saving the day , being a hero . It 's right up your alley . Don 't you see it ? You 're the reason that Gary gets the newspaper . Because deep down , that boy is just like you . What 's going on is ... that you don 't need me anymore . Bernie ... I don 't do anything anymore . But you 're retired . You 've earned the right to relax . I don 't want to relax . I want to be a hero . Every now and then , I want to go out and try and save the day . So , then , when the newspaper fell on our porch , I just thought it was my opportunity to see if I still had what it takes . Look at you . You 're still as beautiful as you were the day that we met . Do you really mean that ? Of course , I mean it . And look at me- - I 'm losing a step . I go down to the Y , I can 't go to the hoop like I used to . Oh , you 'll always be a high school senior to me . You mean that ? Absolutely . You are my hero . You always will be . Oh , God , I love you . Oh , I thought I bored you . Are you kidding me ? I spend all my time trying to keep up with you . Let 's just say good night to Gary . Hey . I got a better idea . Let 's not . ( sighs ) ( mooing ) Mama ! Mama , look at this . It 's Brothers Carpathian . ( sighs )

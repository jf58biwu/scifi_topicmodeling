 Look at this . How do they always get here before we do ? Police band radios . That was a rhetorical question , David . I didn 't really expect an answer . You know me , Curtis . I think most of them would look better in plastic zipper suits . Did you bring the smoke ? No , I figured something like fingerprints we could just guess . Yeah , I brought the smoke . What I can tell you is , we 've got a multiple homicide . No suspects are in custody at the present time . Kevin , you want the statement ? Forensics has given us a significant lead , which we are investigating . That 's all for now . I 'm sorry . That 's it . Glad you could join us . Your boss is already in there shuffling around , scratching his ass , praying for divine inspiration . - What 's the lead ? - Who said we had a lead ? You did . You said Forensics gave you a lead . What am I supposed to say , Dave ? The ME can 't find anything , so we had to bring in his brilliant assistant ? If it ain 't Count fucking Dracula . - Give it a rest , Stew . - Still not talking ? You 'll like it in there , Doc . It 's your kind of party . Her name 's Donna Berman , a student at the Seattle Art Institute . Fucking shame . We got that guy , we got two bods in the back . Here we got Mr. Wu , and back here is Mr. Chang . Hi , Michael . David . It 's provocative , isn 't it ? The position of the bodies indicates two shooters , one by the counter , the other by the door . Wounds look like.45s. Probably a failed stick-up . Judging from the holes in the wall and the blood splatter , I 'd say it was a Magnum . My guess , a.357. If it was a stick-up , the perp wasn 't looking for money . - How do you know that ? - Look . Okay , I 'd like a full report on my desk by 9 : 00 a.m. I have a press conference at 10 : 00 . You got that ? Yeah , okay . - Good night . - See you tomorrow . All right . Let 's smoke it . That 's good with the smoke , thank you . Here we go . Right here . This one 's been wiped . Let 's do an inventory , and find out what was in these drawers . Harold , inventory of the drawer , please . Try drugs , Doc . It 's a fucking drug store . Drug store hit by a junkie . Who would have thought ? Pretty fancy forensic work . Thank you , Stewart . When Dick Tracy 's done in there , lock it up . David , I found a candy bar . It 's a PayDay . No prints , but the bite mark 's not bad . What ? You think there 's a connection ? Absolutely . Do a 48-hour rush DNA analysis on the candy bar . - What am I going to tell Stratton ? - Nothing . You know what that 's gonna cost ? He 'll see the paperwork . Just tell him it 's routine . He won 't know the difference . When I get fired , will you visit me at the homeless shelter ? Curtis , help me out , please . Okay ? Please . - All right . - Thank you . This is a photo from tonight 's pharmacy , and this is one from Mary 's office . Look . - What 's your point ? - The pharmacy shooter could be my guy . How many guys do you know that twist up a matchbook like this ? Look at it . It 's 4 : 30 in the fucking morning , and I 've been up for 18 hours . - What do you want me to do ? - I want you to question him about my wife . That 's it ? Yeah . Well , you got it . I want to get this guy , too . I know it 's been hard on you , Dave . But sometimes you just gotta let things go . I can 't , Don . Thanks . We 'll get this guy . - Is that it , Daddy ? - Let me see . Yes , that 's where I grew up . Right over here is where I went to high school , Garfield High . - Same high school as Jimi Hendrix . - Who 's Jimi Hendrix ? Did Mommy go to Garfield High School , too ? No . She went to high school up north , next to the university . - Is that where she became a lawyer ? - Yes . I want to be a lawyer , just like Mommy . I thought you wanted to be a doctor , like me . No . Lawyers make more money . - They do , do they ? - Yes , they do . What about you , Cara ? What do you want to be ? I don 't know . Can we go ? It 's cold up here . Okay . - Did you have a good time ? - Yeah . - How about you , Cara ? - It was okay , I guess . Cara ! Lindy ! Over here . Bye , Dad . We 're going ice-skating tonight . Don 't I get a kiss ? Sorry . - I love you . - I love you , too . - See you next week ? - Okay . Gotta go . Look what Dad got me . - I get the front seat . - No , you don 't . You get in the back , you get in the front . - Sheila . - You forgot . The Wahlic Foundation , for dinner , we had a date ? Yeah , I did . The next logical step for me was transfer . My original thesis of transferring intelligence was quite simple . The implications are obvious , helping the mentally impaired or those with learning disabilities . Of course , who wouldn 't want a piece of Einstein 's brain power . To date I 've made successful transfers of neuroelectrical impulses . Of course , it 's impossible to get into the mind of rab lats . I mean , lab rats . But my findings show that they respond to the memory of certain incidents more than others . To us these would be things like your first date , your first kiss , or your first car wreck . Events or traumas in our lives that are so powerful they are unforgettable . Excuse me . What are you having ? A Maker 's Mark . - Maker 's Mark and a mineral water , please . - On ice . I hadn 't thought about my first date in years . - Sorry ? - Your speech . First date , first kiss . You were listening . I thought I put the room to sleep . It wasn 't you . I think people tend to drink more than usual at these kinds of dinners . They want to get their money 's worth . Thank you . And you ? I 'm actually very interested in your work . - Really ? - Yeah . I 'm glad I got a chance to meet you . My name 's David . Martha . You 're a neuroscientist ? No , I was a closet microbiologist in school . - So you 've really transferred memory ? - In lab rats , yes . - Really ? How ? - Excuse me . They 're going over to Cutter 's for a nightcap . Are you ready ? - Yeah , I 'll be right with you . - Okay . I 'm sorry . I 've gotta go . I 'd love to know more about your work . Can I call you ? Sure , if you want . Or you can stop by the university . I 'm there every day . - Great . How about tomorrow ? - Tomorrow ? In the morning I 'm free . - 9 : 00 a.m. ? - That 's great . Great . Thanks a lot . I look forward to talking with you . Good night . What 's he like ? - He 's just interested in the work . - Sure he is . That 's what he said . - You know who it is , don 't you ? - No , I 've never seen him before . It 's Dr. Krane . The medical examiner who murdered his wife . They all but caught that guy crushing her skull in . If the police hadn 't botched the case , he 'd be on death row by now . He seemed like a nice guy . I 'm sure he is . But if you go out with him , make sure you wear a crash helmet . Good morning . Hi , Dr. Krane . - You 're early . - I couldn 't wait . Do you still have time ? Sure . - Do you need a hand ? - No . Maybe it 's easier if I just show you . Great . Good morning , Zelda . Ready ? Animal rights people know about you ? As you know , Dr. Krane , neuropeptides mediate ... David . Neuropeptides mediate memory storage and retrieval in the brain . In theory a person 's thought and memory is contained in his cerebral spinal fluid . - The CSF . - Right . But if you injected CSF , you wouldn 't see a thing . Why ? Because there 's no starter , there 's no primer . I started thinking about neuroactive drugs , like norepinephrine and adrenaline . They 'd increase the brain 's sensitivity during memory retrieval . Very good . Hence , your starter . Exactly . This is it . My transfer formula . It 's a combination of norepinephrine , a GABA inhibitor and a few other things . When injected , the brain experiences these new memory impulses as if they were its own . For these impulses to be triggered , the brain requires an outside stimulant , such as a sight , sound , or smell that 's familiar to the other brain 's memory . This rat isn 't familiar with the maze , as you just saw . This is CSF from a rat who knows the maze . By injecting this CSF into this rat , he should be able to run the maze perfectly . - And the cat is ... - The outside stimulant . It 's there to make the memory more vivid . Yes . It has an 80 % success rate . - When do you start human trials ? - That 's a long way off . Why ? There are a few complications , not to mention about seven years ' worth of paperwork . What kind of complications ? Like the norepinephrine stimulates the heart . Heart rate and blood pressure of all the rats increased . - Unfortunately , 30 % of them ... - Had heart attacks . Can 't reduce the dosage . Anything that would inhibit the side effects would also inhibit the memory retrieval . What about taking nitroglycerine ? It might solve the short-term problems , but you 'd still run the risk of long-term damage to the heart . CSF is routinely taken in all autopsies . I know . Every forensic pathologist has at least one or two cases that can 't be solved . I have a class in 10 minutes . I 'd be willing to try it . Excuse me . I 'm just as curious as the next scientist , but that would be completely irresponsible . This is not what I set out to do . It 's a byproduct , I 'd like to keep it that way . Okay . Thanks a lot for your time . I appreciate it , Dr. Briggs . Good luck with everything . Thanks . - Good morning , George . - Morning , Dr. Krane . - How are you ? - Fine , thank you . - Is that from the pharmacy ? - Yeah . Nasty . I heard he shot a girl in the face . Is that true ? A real model citizen . - Dr. Krane ? - Yeah , George ? I was just checking some numbers . - It 's cold in here . I could lend you a coat . - No , I 'm done . Mary ? You 'll never catch me alive . That we 've exchanged this day . Now , by the power that 's vested in me by the state and the church ... Dr. Krane . - Are you okay ? - Yes , I 'm fine . Do you mind if I don 't sign in ? I 'm onto something . You know I can 't do that . Look . Just help me out here . - Is that what I think it is ? - Yeah . I could take a lot of heat for that . Only if somebody finds out . And they 're not going to find out unless you tell them . Come on , please . I gotta visit the head . Anybody shows , you 're on your own . Thanks . No , his face is too round . It was much more narrow . Don 't worry . Focus on the eyes and the rest will follow . They don 't seem right either . They 're too ... Let me just ... The eyes are much more like this . There . Those are the eyes . I didn 't know you could draw . Donna Berman . Seattle Art Institute . Thanks , Jeff . Watch this . Are you okay ? You 're bleeding . Maybe you should see a doctor . Could you send that out for an ID ? Are you kidding ? I could book him on the Queen Mary . Gone . Thanks . I 'm missing a vial of my formula , and I know you have it . I was gonna call you . - Where is it ? - Just wait . - You 've had nosebleeds ? - Hi , Dr. Stratton . Avery tells me you haven 't finished the pharmacy paperwork . I 'm running a little late . - I need it on my desk by noon . - Okay . It works . It was the most amazing thing I ever experienced . I took the nitroglycerine orally to counter the side effects of the norepinephrine . Where is it ? I used it all . Twelve cc 's ? Yeah . I trusted you . You had no right to take it from me ! You 're right . I took something , and I 'm sorry . But look what I 've given you in return . Your first human trial . Who do you think you are ? You could have died . You had no right . Aren 't you even the least bit curious ? You created something incredible . Do you know what I saw ? It 's not what you thought . It 's not like memory . It 's more than that . It was like a raw experience . Like the past is present . Like I was actually there . Do you know murders can be solved ? Questions can be answered . This is about your wife , isn 't it ? You took her CSF , didn 't you ? You have no idea what you 've done to yourself . I have no idea . I haven 't even completed side-effect research on my rats . I 'm telling you that your formula works , and you 're talking to me about rats . Okay . I want you in my lab . I need full blood work , an EKG , full respiratory . And a brain scan wouldn 't be a bad idea , just to make sure you have one . It 's not funny . All right , I 'll be by this afternoon . Let me just finish this paperwork . How about right now , Doctor ? No bruits . Regular rate and rhythm . No murmurs , rubs or extra heart sounds . And the lungs are clear . There 's been some damage . I can live with that . You can live with that ? You 've done significant damage to your heart . It 's my heart . It 's my experiment . If somebody finds out about this ... You 're right . I 'm sorry . If there was another way , I would have done it . But what 's done is done . - Nobody will find out unless you tell them . - Or unless you die . I 'm not gonna die . Even if I did , they 'd never link it to you . Most mes won 't find foreign matter unless they 're told to look for it . I can keep a secret , can you ? - Where 's your phone ? - In there . Avery , it 's me . They already found a match on your drawing . This equipment is incredible . - What 's his name ? - Eddie Dutton . This guy has a lovely résumé . Listen to this . Drugs , grand theft , aggravated assault . They even tried to nail him on those contract hits in Chinatown last year . What 's his last known address ? 25 Hastings , Dodson Hotel . He lived with his girlfriend . Okay . Call Bresler and tell him that Dutton is the pharmacy shooter . What should I say when he stops laughing ? Tell him you ID 'd him from the candy bar . But I haven 't . We 're waiting to hear . Please , you 've gotta help me out . Look , that 's not confirmed . I can 't put my ... Please , just do it for me . All right , David . But this time it 's your ass . I gotta go . - No , you don 't . - I 've got work to do . You 're not leaving my sight for the next 48 hours . I can 't stay here . Okay , I 'll go with you . - No . - Yes . Wait a minute . You 're the one who made yourself part of my experiment . I don 't have time for this . If you leave without me , I 'll call the police . - Must you drive so fast ? - Yes . It 's part of my job . 1 : 00 p.m. Subject appears irritable , anxious and tense . - Stay with the car . - Where are you going ? Hang on . - Are you the manager ? - Yeah . I 'm with the Seattle Medical Examiner 's Office . I 'm looking for a guy named Eddie Dutton . - Do you know where I could find him ? - Are you a cop ? No , I 'm with the Seattle ... Damn it . What are you staring at ? Fucking fag . What are you looking at me like that for ? Are you a pretty boy ? Get out of here , you fucking ... Sorry . David , you have to stop ! - Your heart ! It 's extremely weak . - Get lost ! You have to stop . Shit . What the fuck do you think you 're doing ? Get out of the fucking truck . - You fucked up my car . - I 'm sorry . It was just an accident . You can 't see a fucking parked car on the street ? I said I was sorry . What do you want me to do ? - Are you okay ? - Get your fucking wallet out of the car . - Martha Briggs . - Fuck you . Okay . - You are fucking lucky . - Move the car ! We know the way we would like to reason , but all too often it leads to change . And it 's how we react to this change ... Let him go ! Put him down . Put him down ! Back off right now , or I 'm going to cut him . Please , he 's only a child . Back off ! You don 't think I 'll cut him ? I 'll fucking cut him like a fish . Right through the guts , man . Back off . Call the dogs off , man . Fuck off ! Back up ! Put the knife down . Call your dogs off right now , or I 'm going to cut him . Please , put the gun down . Yeah , put the gun down . Come on , man . Put the gun down now ! Put them down ! - What 's it gonna be ? - Take it easy . I don 't give a fuck anymore . Get me a car , or this boy is gonna die . Stop moving , man . Back up , man . Nobody 's listening to me ! Back up ! Put the kid down . I 'm gonna run this boy . Eddie . No ! Get off ! Stay back . Nobody move ! Shit . Jesus , Krane ! What are you doing here ? I was following a lead . Lead ? You 're way out of bounds , Krane . This isn 't the fucking Coroner 's Office . Get up ! Tell me that again . I was following a lead . He was getting away . That 's his gun . Is that right ? I think you 've seen one too many episodes of Quincy . It 's over . Keep this up , you 'll get yourself killed . Is that the guy ? I guess I 'll never know . Get this guy out of here . Are you all right ? David ? Could we talk ? - Could you excuse us , please ? - I 'll wait outside . You went behind my back for the saliva test . It 's not even back yet , and you 've already ID 'd a suspect . You want to explain that to me ? You want to explain it to the DA ? Neither do I. Excuse me , Dr. Krane . - Did you see Stratton ? - Yeah . - Well , what happened ? - He fired me . Fired you ? - Where 's the car ? - It 's around the corner . I don 't know what happened . Someone must have shown him the paperwork . - Dr. Avery , we 're ready . - One second . I warned you about this . Sorry about your job , but you 've been putting my job on the line . I mean , look at this . I think you could use the time off . Thanks . - What are we doing here ? - I have to pick up a few things . - Can 't it wait ? - No . Aren 't you tired ? No . Do you want to follow me in here , too , or wait in my office ? No , I 'll wait in your office . - First hall on the left . - I know , I remember . Don Bresler , please . Karen , could you replace the blade on the saw ? It 's a little dull from this morning . Bresler 's on 2 , he wants to talk to you . What are you doing here ? You wanna get fired twice in one day ? I just came in to pick up a few things . He 's on 2 . - What does he want ? - I don 't know . He wanted to talk to the lead coroner . That 's you , isn 't it ? Yeah . I 'll take the call in my office . Get that blade , please . Yes , Doctor . No , wait . I didn 't call Bresler , he called me . That 's what he said . Yes , I 'll hold . Thanks , I really appreciate it . And I 'll try to be back by Monday , okay ? Okay . Thanks . Bye . No , I think I 've done enough . You know what ? Just tell him , if he needs me , I 'm here . It 's Dr. Curtis Avery . Yes . Thank you . Ridiculous . Perfect . - Found it . - It 's not on yet ? Are you ready ? 3 : 14 . Subject still engaged in high level of activity . Typically , my rats nap very heavily in the first 48 hours following an injection . I wonder if this is an effect of combining the norepinephrine and nitro . You 're not the least bit tired ? Now that you mention it , I could use some sleep . Where can I drop you off ? How about your house ? You want to come to my house ? Just in case you die , I 'd rather you not do it on my couch . Aren 't you thoughtful ? I see you here , and I want you . I 'm gonna fuck you . Fuck you ! Come on . My God . The nitro . Where 's the nitro ? Open your mouth . He didn 't kill her . Somebody else killed her . You have to stop . You can 't do this ! Come here . I was passed out 76 feet away from my wife when she was murdered . Right here . Dead drunk . Do you know what it 's like to live with that ? I can 't even take my kids to the store . People are whispering and staring at me . My own kids are starting to think that I did it . I 'm not going to stop until I catch the guy that killed my wife . And I 'm not going to stop until I get ... God damn it , Eddie . You stupid little jerk . What is it ? Stupid mutt . It 's the dog . He 's killing him . David , stay with me . Stay here . Dutton 's memory . Look at me . Look at the picture , David . Go on . Tell me about Mary and the kids . She was the best thing that ever happened to me . Tell me about her . We were arguing for months . It was my fault . My drinking was out of control . One night I just lost it . I started smashing things . I apologized , but ... Things were never the same after that . The day before she died , she said that we had to talk . She said we had to start taking responsibility for our relationship . I figured she wanted a divorce , so I went out and got drunk . I should have been there for her . She never had the chance to tell me she was five weeks pregnant . I read about it in an autopsy report . I miss her . I really miss her . It 's all right . I have all the equipment I need . No one needs to know . I could do the tests myself . Do you know what you 're asking me to do here ? He 's out of control . He 's not going to stop until he finds the man who killed his wife . I know that . You have to admit , it 's possible , right ? Yeah , it 's possible . So , you 're his friend . Will you help me ? Stratton can never find out about this . Where did you get her fetal blood ? Avery gave it to me . He said it never occurred to him either to do a paternity test . Some of things you said last night struck me as odd . Like the fact that Mary never told you she was pregnant . I 've been through a divorce , I know what can happen . I 'm sorry you had to find out like that . There is another way to look at it . Maybe he 's the man you 've been looking for . It sounds like nobody knew about him , so how could he be a suspect until now ? Do you have any idea who he might be ? I 'll be right back . - What are you doing here ? - We need to talk . - You talk to my lawyer . - I 'm not talking about the kids . - I 'm not talking to you , I 'm calling the cops . - Who was she seeing ? I just came from a paternity test . That baby wasn 't mine . Why are you doing this ? Kelly , if you don 't tell me what was going on ... Are you going to hit me the way you did Mary ? - I never hit her and you know it . - Do I ? Did you ever stop and think for one moment that I might actually be innocent ? To be perfectly honest , no . I 'm going to have the police contact you for a statement . I 'm not going to allow you to rob her of her dignity . - Tell it to the cops . - He was a cop . A detective . She wanted to call it off . For some unknown reason , she wanted to work it out with you . What was his name ? I don 't know . She didn 't tell me . This is not gonna get those girls back . You were right . Come on , you guys . I got four stiffs . - I 'll be right back . - I 'll be here if you need me . They 're dead , they 're in Chinatown , and everybody 's on my ass . Give me a fucking break , will you ? Don , I need to speak with you . Strangely enough , so do these men . If you 'd wait a fucking minute ... It 's important . Give me a minute , fellas . - Is this about your wife ? - Yeah . It 's still my case . I 'll stay . All right , what 's the news flash ? Are you okay ? Yeah . Are you all right ? I just came from a ... I just came from a paternity test on Mary 's fetal blood . The baby wasn 't mine . She was having an affair . No . Cheating on a sweetheart like you . Gleick , don 't . I 'm telling you , don 't . I spoke with Mary 's sister , and she said that he was a detective . She can confirm it . Did she say who it was ? You 're saying a cop killed your wife ? No . All I 'm saying is that he could be the guy . What about Eddie Dutton ? He was there , but he didn 't kill her . How the fuck do you know that ? Because there 's no physical evidence . Somebody else came into that room and killed my wife . It must have been her boyfriend , the detective . He 's on the sauce again , Don . Toss this quack out of here . - That 's it . - Tell me about how I do my job ? Break it up . You were one step away from being in prison if that fucking rookie cop didn 't screw up . Fuck-o . David , because of your matchbook , I was getting ready to close this case . You are one of the best at what you do . This time you are grasping at thin air , pal . I 'm gonna do you a favor . I 'm gonna close this case . You want me to reopen it , bring me physical evidence . What 's the matter ? Phil , take Krane to the hospital . Something 's wrong . Wait . Take it easy . - I 'll take him . - Who are you ? - Dr. Briggs . - Are you his doctor ? No , I 'm his friend . - Did Eddie Dutton spend a lot of time here ? - This place is a revolving door for Eddie . - Will you be able to take care of him ? - He 'll be fine . Take it easy , David . Let me look at you . Oh , my God . I 'll take you to the hospital . No , it 's okay . I 'm fine . Somebody help me ! Come on , get on your feet . Oh , Jesus , David . - What 's the matter ? - Are you hurt ? Listen . - What 's the matter ? - He 's drunk . Do you have any idea what went on here tonight ? No . It 's Mary . Get ahold of him . He 's stinking drunk . Take it easy . I don 't want you going in there ! Blood alcohol level , 2 . 5 . That 's a lot of booze there , Doc . Pretty stressful job , cutting up bodies all day long . You gotta unwind somehow . I understand . What 's it take with you , a pint ? I want to see Mary . Daddy ! My girls . Those are my girls ! Get in here ! You got a violent temper , Doc . This is my house ! Open the door . Scare your little girls . " Daddy , don 't ! " " Shut up , Mary ! Can you just shut up ? " " Oh , my God . What have I done ? " Based on the physical evidence , we estimate the time of death at 10 : 00 p.m. You were there when the terminal blow was delivered . It doesn 't look good . " I 'm sorry . I never meant to hurt you and the girls . " Sometimes , my temper overcomes me . " I 'm sorry . " Pick up that poker . What the hell are you doing ? Get him out of here , Curtis . Come on . - Don 't hurt her . - We 're not gonna hurt her . You gotta go now . Come on . - What the hell is going on ? - Gleick and his guys screwed up . They found that note that you left for your wife before they got the search warrant . They can 't do that . They don 't have a case . - But I wanna go to trial . - No , you don 't . I didn 't do it . So , you didn 't kill your wife . Go find the guy that did . After careful review of all the evidence presented in this case , the court has no choice but to dismiss the charges . Case dismissed . Hey , Doc . How are you feeling ? - It 's the right thing to do . - No ! Daddy ? Hi , Cara . Hi , Lindy . You 're not gonna leave us like Mommy did , are you ? No . Come here . I 'm so glad to see you . - I love you . - Me , too . - How are you feeling ? - Much better . I 'm glad you 're here . So am I. I guess you were right . I would say your days of being a lab rat are pretty much over . Dr. Briggs ? There 's a phone call for you . I 'll be right back . What happened ? Okay , I 'll be right over . What 's the matter ? Something happened at the lab . I have to go . What ? I don 't know . They told me to get there as soon as I could . - Are you gonna be all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Okay . Nice to have you back . Excuse me . - Wait a minute . - It 's my lab . Hey , Doc ? How are you feeling ? I asked the nurse if it was okay to come in . I can come back later if you want . No . What does the name Joseph Bodner mean to you ? Nothing . You never met or heard of a Joseph Bodner ? No . I think he 's your cop . - What ? - Yeah . After you left , I started asking around . I found out a few things . Like this Bodner hasn 't been active for a year . Hasn 't been with the department . - Is he still around ? - Yeah , he 's at St. Paul 's . Suicide attempt .. 38 under the chin . What 's really interesting is when it happened . May 21 . - That 's the same day . - Exactly . It 'd be real easy to write it off as a murder-suicide if it wasn 't for Eddie Dutton . What 's your wife doing with Eddie Dutton ? - Using drugs ? - No . - Was she dealing ? - No . So she 's this bigwig Assistant DA . She doesn 't make a lot of friends in that job . I 've been through all her cases . I never found anything . The only one who knows what happened is Joseph Bodner , and he 's not talking . Why ? He 's in a coma . If I find out anything else , I 'll let you know . I hate being wrong . And if I 'm wrong about you , I wanna be the first to know . Coroner 's Office . Martha , what happened ? I don 't know . There was some kind of explosion . They said maybe it was a gas leak or something . - Are you okay ? - No . What are you doing here ? How did you get out of the hospital ? Is there any left ? Is that all you care about ? A bullet passed through the cerebral hemisphere destroying the brain functions . Unfortunately , there was enough left of the mid-brain to drive the heart and the lungs . We 'd pull the plug if there was one , but technically he 's still alive . He could outlive all of us and not even know it . It 's sad how many self-inflicted gunshot wounds end up just like this . I gotta get back to my rounds . - Thank you , Dr. Smoot , I appreciate it . - It 's a pleasure . There was another man in tonight asking about Mr. Bodner . Detective Gleick ? He didn 't give his name . Could have been a cop . Thank you . He knows everything . What are you thinking ? All I need is five cc 's . No way . Are you crazy ? Your heart can 't ... Just keep your eyes open . Just give me two minutes . Let me do it . Why not ? My heart 's stronger . You just had a heart attack . If you don 't let me do it , I 'll destroy what 's left . Martha , he tried to commit suicide . You can 't have another injection . It 'll kill you . You 'd do that for me ? Yes . Besides , it is my experiment , and I feel like I 've been missing out on all the fun . I should at least do it once , right ? You mean to tell me that he just disappeared ? No , I 'm telling you I have no record of him checking out . When we find him , we 'll notify you . Daddy always said he hated hospitals . Thank you so much for your help . Let 's go . Here 's Bodner . Those nitroglycerine tabs are bad . So I have something that I think is gonna be much better . It 's propranolol . I thought about using it before , but I opted for the glycerin tabs because I 'm not that crazy about needles . Me neither . Are you sure you wanna do this ? Yes . I 'm gonna tape you in for your own protection . Is that necessary ? I don 't know , but I 'm not taking any chances . He committed suicide . It 's okay . Come on . Wednesday , April 3 , 9 : 25 p.m. I 'm about to experience my first memory injection . The CSF belongs to Joseph Bodner . Okay . What are you doing ? Let me do it . Don 't ! I said I would do it ! Your heart can 't take another injection . You 'll die ! What about the kids , David ? Stay here . Talk to me . Look at me . Self-inflicted gunshot . We 'd pull the plug ... There was enough left of the mid-brain to drive the heart . He needs me and I wanna be with him . - I thought we had something . - We did . I care about you very much . But I love David . Here 's the name of another attorney . He 's very good . - Then it 's over . - I think it 's for the best . Stay here . Talk to me . Look at me ! You have to untie me . I have to get him to a hospital . Hurry ! What 's this ? Did he do that to you ? Just untie me ! I need to help him ! What 's wrong with him ? You 're a good cop , Joey . Any partner that lets his partner retire on a policeman 's pension is a sorry-ass son-of-a-bitch . I can 't let that happen to you . He 's insane . He wants to kill me . Turn state 's evidence . Plea-bargaining will get you out in no time . I couldn 't do that . It might be your only choice . Just help me out of here . I have to get him to a hospital . What is this ? Is this the shit he was high on in my office ? Is this how he knew about Eddie Dutton ? I can put you away for 10 years , or we can work together . That might prompt a little loss of memory on my part . Yeah , sure , I 'll work with you . You 're a smart boy , Eddie . - Is this how he knew about Eddie Dutton ? - No , it 's a project I 'm working on in my lab . I know all about your lab , Professor . I 'm the guy that made it go bye-bye . I 'm very interested in your work . Wanna know why ? Because when David came to my office , the only way he could have known all that shit about Eddie was if he was Eddie Dutton . I guess that means your little experiment worked . He 's insane . He 'll kill me . There 's our boy , Joey . - Better take this . It 's clean . - I 'm not killing anyone , Don . I 'm not killing anybody either . I 'm performing a public service for fun and profit . Police ! Lift them ! Drop it , you fucker ! Drop it ! All right , take a walk , Eddie . Take a walk , Eddie . - You rat-fink motherfucker . - You 're dead , Eddie . Beat it ! You little prick . Jesus Christ . What the fuck is the matter with you ? Grab the shit and the money , Joey . Still partners , Joey ? Yeah . Why don 't you finish this one ? Congratulations . You were that smart that you knew how to do it . I was smart enough to figure it out . Jesus Christ . I didn 't hear a knock . I had a key made . What the fuck is that about ? You know what I see here ? I see a very ugly situation . I see a washed-up junkie doctor and his kinky , glue-sniffing college girlfriend . I see they were having a party . Things got out of hand . A fire gets started . Monster 's gonna kill me . You could turn state 's evidence . Both victims expire on the spot from smoke inhalation . What the fuck is that about ? It 's about being partners with Don Bresler . So is this , Joey . You sold me out to that lawyer you 've been fucking . Bye-bye , Joey . It 's about being partners with Don Bresler . So is this , Joey . You sold me out to that lawyer you were fucking . Impressive . You took care of Bodner while Eddie came over here to kill Mary . Then you came over here to kill Eddie . But he was gone . Mary was still alive . You killed my wife . Now , you listen to me , Krane . I was keeping an eye on Bodner . I thought I could trust him . But he was gonna turn me in , and your wife was gonna help . I 'm sorry you got framed for your wife 's murder . I didn 't plan that . That just happened . And you wanna know something ? When Gleick fucked up and you walked , I was happy . And do you wanna know why I was happy ? Because I thought to myself , if this guy cleans up his act , his kids will have a father . But you couldn 't do that , could you ? You couldn 't just walk away . You fucked up , Krane . No , don 't . The kids . Help ! Dad ! Kelly , go get help ! 1137 Feldlar , yes . Thank you . There 's three people inside . Yes , quickly . Hurry ! Hurry ! - David ! - Daddy ! - Wait for me ! - No , you can 't go in . Are you all right ? Are you okay ? - Here . Take this . - Thanks . It 's okay , girls . David ? Do you want some cider ? What a shame . The guy 's been through the wringer . Is he always like this ? The doctors are cautious , but they 're optimistic . The burns are pretty bad , but they said they 've seen worse . They have stabilized his vital functions . Of course , they 're monitoring his heart . But their main concern is his mental state . I mean , he should be responding , but he 's not . With all the formula he injected ... You there , Doc ? Guess I was wrong about you . I got your guy . Bresler . Who would have thought ? He could snap out of it any minute , or he could stay this way indefinitely . Hang in there , David . If anything changes , let me know . We saw raccoons over there , five of them . Red , Ted , Ned , Ed and Fred . Leaves on Lindy .

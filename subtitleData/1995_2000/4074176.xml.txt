 [ Panting ] North perimeter clear . No sign of him . [ Agent # 1 ] south access clear . [ Technician ] camera one , pan right . Mulder , make for the west entrance . [ Agent # 2 ] west gate , no sign of suspect . [ Technician ] two , angle south entrance . [ Agent # 3 ] mid park clear . [ Scully ] there . - The bus . - [ Technician ] three , zoom in . [ Skinner ] stay close , mulder . We have alpha off at eastbound metro bus . [ Agent # 1 ] i have alpha heading south . [ Technician ] one , follow suspect . Beta , contact made . [ Voice , filtered ] sorry i 'm late . It 's okay . All right , hold your positions . [ Agent # 1 ] everybody stand by . What 's he looking at ? [ Technician ] two , pick it up . - [ Continues panting ] - Mulder , he 's watching you . [ Mutters ] all right ? [ Agent # 2 ] he 's reaching for something . Here 's what you were waiting for . [ Technician ] one , zoom in . Okay , slowly . [ Alpha continues talking ] Slowly . Wait for it . Wait , wait , wait for it . [ Mutters ] okay . [ Groaning ] what ? What ? What ? What happened ? - [ Continues groaning ] - What just happened ? I don 't know what the hell happened . Anybody ! A doctor ! I need a doctor over here ! My friend 's sick here . I don 't know what 's goin ' - - Oh , god . He just- - He just fell- - Oh , man . Is he okay ? - What the hell 's going on ? - [ Scully ] i can 't see anything . Beta target down . [ Agent # 1 ] we lost alpha . [ Skinner ] go ! Go ! Go ! - There . He 's heading west . He 's on the move ! - [ Mulder ] i 'm on him . Maintain your position on the downed beta . [ Skinner ] find the alpha on three . Federal agent . Step aside . Oh , my god ! [ Skinner ] what is it ? What the hell did he do to him ? What ? What are you seeing ? Come on , talk to me . Talk to me ! [ Agent # 1 ] it 's eating away his flesh . - What ? - Haley must be carrying something lethal . [ Man ] we need a doctor ! Where 's mulder ? [ Skinner ] mulder was on him . There 's no way he couldn 't catch him . Mulder , respond ! Can you find him ? Zoom in . I can 't see anything . [ Scully ] mulder , suspect is armed and dangerous . Pursue alpha with extreme caution . Mulder ! Damn it . Agent scully ! Scully ! - What happened ? - I lost him . What do you mean ? He got away . I came in early . I wanted to take a look at the surveillance tape to make sure i wasn 't crazy . [ Sighs ] What happened out there , mulder ? " What happened " ? There were 12 agents yesterday in the park . We had ownership of the suspect . We were in position to make the capture , and you let him get away . And from what i see now , you may have even aided in his escape . I don 't know what you 're talking about . It 's on the video , mulder . I can 't prove it was you , but i know what i saw . This man is a murderer . He 's a terrorist . I have a report to give this morning . I expect you to give me an answer . I expect you to tell me the truth . We 're late for the hearing . [ Door opens ] Fifteen hours ago , a joint f.B.I.-C.I.A. Task force ... assembled to capture jacob steven haley , Second in command of the militia group known as new spartans . Intelligence revealed haley was to make an exchange of money ... for a quantity of automatic weapons ... to conduct domestic terrorist activities ... and to further their expressed goal of overthrowing the federal government . Due to reasons that are still under review , Our operation failed . Jacob steven haley remains at large , whereabouts unknown . What about the weapons ? An arms dealer named khadri who died at the scene received from haley ... a $ 50,000 bearer bond . Presumably this was payment for weapons delivered . In other words , haley not only got away , He got away with $ 50,000 worth of guns ? Have we determined a cause of death , how haley killed this man ? He was killed by means of a highly toxic biological agent . - What kind of toxin ? - We don 't know . Its effect on the dermis and the soft tissues , the rapidity of its action- - It is not a disease known in nature . It would seem to be genetically engineered- - A bio-Weapon . How the hell did he get it ? [ Man ] the former soviet union . Security on the siberian vector lab ... is , uh , lax . It 's conceivable it was stolen , Though we have no confirmation from moscow . So , is this in the ozone now ? Is this stuff floating through folger park ? [ Scully ] level four decontamination procedures ... were undertaken immediately . Our best indications are that exposure was limited ... and that the toxin was transmitted directly and not contagious . - How do you know that ? - [ Mulder ] we 're not all dead . [ Smattering of nervous laughter ] At this point we can only guess ... that the toxin was transmitted by liquid or gas , Touch or injection . Anybody care to tell me how this guy haley eluded us ? [ Skinner ] video recon indicates haley had an accomplice at the park . We 've yet to identify who this was or how haley knew he was under surveillance . - He must have made us . - Could he have ? Every member of this task force was chosen for their lack of exposure in terrorist circles . Haley 's extremely suspicious , to the point of paranoia . He 's got military training and a guerilla mentality . Second only to this man . August bremer . He 's the group 's mastermind . However , there are reports that he and haley are vying for control . This destabilization makes august bremer our primary threat . Well , this is it , the scenario we 've all been worried about , people . Now , i need maximum control of information . Nothing leaves this room . The media gets a sniff , we 're gonna disavow . We are gonna stop these men . We 're gonna make it all go away . [ Agents murmuring , whispering ] Mulder . The show 's almost over . One , please . [ Man ] meet you over there , okay ? [ Woman ] all right . Thanks . I 'd like some popcorn , please . Do you want large , Extra large ... or jumbo large ? Could i get some fresh popcorn , please ? The sign says " fresh popcorn . " - This is fresh popcorn . - No , freshfresh . Hot , out of that machine back there . Please . A large . I have to make it . Probably take a minute . [ Phone rings ] [ Ringing continues ] - Yeah ? - You set me up . - I saved your ass . - Then why wasn 't i told ? [ Mulder ] i didn 't know about the operation . It was your operation . No , no , the justice department got an anonymous tip . I found out about half an hour before it went down . I did what i could . - You 'll have to do better than that , mulder . - What else can i say ? I got as much to lose here as you do . They catch you , you 'll flip me . Look , i believe in your ideals and your goals . The only reason i tolerate your methods is because the government 's are worse . Wow , what a ringing endorsement . Hey , you came to me . Remember ? What more do you want from me ? I 've risked everything . I 've given you information . My partner is seriously suspicious . If that 's not enough for you , that 's all i got . [ Boy ] ain 't nobody home . Oh , she 's in there . She 's just hidin' or somethin ' . We could make a break for it , right through the front doors . Why ? I got us front-Row seats . [ Chuckles ] [ Whispers ] here . [ Movie : man ] trust me , guys . Shh . [ Giggling ] shh ! [ Movie : man ] duck . Dddd [ orchestral , dramatic ] [ Movie : man grunts ] look out ! She see us ? Is she coming ? [ Movie soundtrack continues ] Hey , man . [ Gasps ] Maybe you can tell me what 's going on . What ? There seems to be a problem . A man just told me you gave him keys to my room- - Room 130 . Who are you ? Who ami ? Who is he ? Mr. , uh , kaplan . Mr. Kaplan . Yes . Thank you . Are you the wife ? Not even close . [ Sighs ] [ Rings ] yeah ? We 'll proceed as planned . [ Door closes ] [ Man whispers ] agent mulder , you 're coming with us . [ Engine starts ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Knocking on window ] - Step out of the car . - [ Knocking continues ] [ Scully ] exactly what agency are you guys from ? Obviously not the office of information . [ Knock on window ] Agent scully , take a seat . What the hell is going on ? - I apologize for our methods . - They may well have saved agent mulder 's life . What about my life ? I don 't appreciate being run off the road . We had our reasons . You 're suspicious agent mulder 's betrayed his country . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Your discretion is understandable . In point of fact , agent mulder 's actions are entirely honorable . What you 've stumbled into is a classified action , a deep cover assignment . Until now , agent mulder 's true mission was known only to the u.S. Attorney and myself . His " true mission " ? The council we sat in was a front ... to make the new spartans believe we were unaware of agent mulder 's complicity . Why him ? - Why choose agent mulder ? - We didn 't choose him . They did . He spoke at a u.F.O. Conference in boston , Where he apparently broadcast his feelings about the government ... and their conspiracies against the american people . Somebody from the organization was listening . The man who escaped- - Haley- - Sent out feelers ... in hopes that agent mulder was a man whose politics were in line with his own . Someone on the inside that he could use . - To what aim ? - That , we don 't know . You 've put agent mulder 's life in danger by not telling me . Agent mulder came to me . I advised him not to tell you . He 's at a very delicate point . Everything he does now must work to build trust . Including letting this man haley get away with murder ? Sir , we know nothing about this bio-Weapon . We don 't know what they want to use it for . We don 't even know if they have the capacity to store it safely . Putting agent mulder in this situation ... is extremely risky . They want something from him . We have no other way of learning what . - [ Door opens ] - Movie theater in ohio . Whatever they 're using , they 've used it again . [ Engine off ] [ emergency brake sets ] Is this the pepsi challenge ? How about some fresh air , boys ? [ Sighs ] Welcome , agent mulder . Okay , deal me in . This is just a little method that we use ... to learn the truth . You might want to put that hood back on me , unless you want to see a grown man cry . What happened in the park ? [ Exhales ] i told you on the phone . - [ Groans ] - I was set up . I 'm telling the truth . Wait . Wait . Wait ! [ Gasps ] I let you go . You 're spying on us , aren 't you ? No . No ! Aaah ! [ Groans ] You want me to lie and say yes ? [ Groans ] i 'm gonna kill you , you son of a bitch ! I 'm gonna kill you ! If i set you up , you think i 'd get in the car with this nazi piece of sh- [ Finger cracking ] - Aaah ! I risked everything ! If i was lying , there 'd be federal agents descending on this place ... like the wrath of god right now ! You touch me again , you 'd better kill me ! [ Groaning ] A war is going on , agent mulder . Either you 're on the right side , Or the wrong . [ Exhaling sharply ] - You 've seen the effects of this ? - Yes . - Would you like to see them again ? - No . I didn 't set you up . If you got set up , it was one of yours . - [ Snaps ] - [ Shouts ] [ Mulder whimpers ] You know what ? I believe you . As far as i can tell , you 're all clear in there . What are you reading in there ? We 've been through and through . No hot zones , no atmospherics . You 're clear , agent scully . Thank you . There 's 14 victims total , Including patrons , a projectionist and an employee . [ Sighs ] That 's the usherette . There were two survivors- - Two teen-Aged boys . How does it happen that those two kids survived ? I don 't know , But it 's gonna help us establish a method of delivery . It 's doubtful the pathogen was airborne . They found no atmospheric traces . So it 's gotta be something that everybody touched . Don 't be alarmed . Scully , get outta here . - Mulder- - - Get outta here ! I know what you 're doing . Skinner told me everything . I don 't know what you 're talking about . What happened to your hand ? Nothing . Oh , mulder , what did they do to you ? This needs to be set . You 're in pain . Yeah , if you keep pulling it around like that . Let 's get the swelling down . [ Sighs ] They 've killed again , mulder . Fourteen people in a movie theater in ohio . The same toxin they released in the park . Fourteen people ? That doesn 't make any sense . Unless it was a test ... for something bigger . Why do this to you , mulder ? [ Mulder on transceiver ] they 're testing me too . Haley 's paranoid , spooked . I was sure he was gonna kill me . [ Scully on transceiver ] what stopped him ? [ Mulder ] he still needs something from me . I 'm sensing there 's someone haley trusts even less . The man giving him his orders . Someone i haven 't met yet . A guy named august bremer . What happened to your hand ? Terrorist lie detector . Well , did you pass ? I must have . I 'm still here . They told me what they want . Documentation from the federal reserve bank . Fund transfer schedules for the eastern seaboard . Cash money . They 're gonna hit a bank or an armored car . That 's it ? That 's all ? I think i convinced haley that the near miss in folger park ... was due to a mole inside his own group . - He wants surveillance files on them . - How soon ? They 're waiting for my call . We 'll need some time to dummy something up . No , no , i anticipated this . I 've got files ready to use . I 'm getting a bad feeling about this . I want a tail on him . No tail . Once they get what they want , what 's to keep them from killing him ? They spot a tail on him , they 're gonna shoot him on the spot . We have got no other way of learning what they want past this , What the big picture is . You may not have another chance to contact us . If you don 't hear from me by midnight , Feed my fish . [ Man ] that 's it . That 's your bug . [ Scully ] it 's a bacterium . An especially virulent one . We isolated it from the bearer bond . Was the bacterium also found on the ticket stub ? Actually , no . Barring the usual particles and dust mites , The ticket stub was clean . Well , then how was the biotoxin spread throughout the theater ? I don 't know . [ Scully ] it looks like streptococcus . A strain of streptococcus , but one that has been genetically altered ... to make it extraordinarily lethal . But strep wouldn 't be able to survive any kind of exposure to the environment . Normally , but , uh , whoever produced this ... has cleverly coated the bacterium ... with a synthetic protective covering . [ Beeps ] the covering gives them an adhesive quality . It 's like scratch-And-Sniff . Dermal contact activates the contagion . It 's ingenious , in its own evil way . Developed by the russians ? No , i 've seen everything in the russian arsenal . They 've got nothing this sophisticated . Well , then , by whom ? [ Door closes ] [ light switch clicking ] Do you have what we need ? Tell the gimp to back off . Give me the files . I need that back by tomorrow . Lies within lies . Put the hood on . You 're going with us . No . You put it on , or the gimp puts it on for you . [ Ring ] Skinner . The biotoxin was applied to the bearer bond with an aerosol spray , But there is no evidence of it whatsoever on the theater stubs . Now , i still have no idea how these kids were unaffected . Have you i.D. ' D the toxin ? Agent scully ? Sir , are you alone ? No . Why ? I 'd like to speak with you in private . [ Click ] You 're off the speaker . Thank you . Now , c.I.A. Intelligence suggested that this biotoxin was stolen from the russians , But my research indicates that it was almost certainly developed domestically . The united states has no bio-Weapons . President nixon dismantled our program in 1969 . Yes , sir , that 's what we 've been told , But the c.D.C. Database contains evidence of a streptococcus bacterium ... being developed by the army 's pine bluff facility in the 1960s . It appears to be a very primitive strain of what we 're seeing here . What are you saying ? What i 'm saying is that the bio-Weapons program may have continued in secret ... and that someone may be sending agent mulder on a suicide mission . Right . Thank you . What is it ? She 's just concerned for her partner . You put us all at risk bringing him here . We took the usual precautions . Anyway , he came through for us . Federal reserve schedules for tomorrow . You 're a believer ? I have my beliefs . You willing to die for them ? I 'd prefer it didn 't come to that . We have a job to do . [ Bremer ] you 're dracula . [ Sighs ] Oh , damn . [ Sighs ] The money . Oh , my god . The money . Mulder , take it . Make sure you point that the right way . May i have the keys , please ? Yes , here . [ Alarm beeping , volume increasing ] [ Beeping continues ] [ Beeping stops ] You do what i say , or i 'll shoot you ! Three minutes ! Open the gate . Open it ! - Get down ! Now ! - [ All screaming ] Everybody down ! Don 't be foolish ! Give us the money , and we 'll be gone ! Move back ! Come on ! Move it ! All right , hit it ! Down , now ! - Don 't touch that phone ! - Dracula , take the teller . Step away from the counter . Open the doors . Put your hands up on the windows ! Now ! Now ! Do it ! You ! Here ! Get down ! Now ! On the floor ! - Nobody move ! - Two minutes ! Let 's open it . Open it ! Don 't move ! - I got it . - [ Gunshot ] [ Screaming continues ] [ Woman sobbing ] oh , my god ! Is he dead ? No . He 's still alive . Finish him ! One minute , thirty . [ Whimpers ] you ! Face down , on the floor ! Right here ! Now ! What are you waiting for ? Do it ! Get down ! [ Man whimpering ] I told you to finish him . Finish him ! That weapon 's traceable . Go . [ Gunshot ] [ screaming ] Get the hell out of here . Go ! Go ! What are you doing ? What are you doing ? The bills could be traced . The bank heist was a decoy ... to contaminate the money you didn 't take . No more tests , mr . Mulder . This is the real deal . You 've been a big help . Put that down . He 's a liability . To who ? You ? If you think you 're gonna kill mulder to protect your secret , it 's too late . I already know your secret . Agent mulder provided us with f.B.I. Surveillance reports , Files which contained a name , A source who 's been leaking information on us for a period of two years . Charles bogard . See , bogard is an alias , an old one , for august bremer . Agent mulder knows my alias , Just as he knew a false report would feed your ambition and pit you against me . Mulder risked his life for us . Are you sure about that ? [ Mulder ] they 're testing me too . [ Continues on tape ] haley 's paranoid , spooked . I was sure he was gonna kill me . [ Scully ] what stopped him ? He still needs something from me . I 'm sensing there 's someone haley trusts even less . What the hell is this ? Director skinner , you 've got to get to mulder . You 've gotta find the bank they hit . That 's what we 're trying to do . Agent mulder 's life is in danger , And anybody else who touches the currency at that location . They 're putting the biotoxin on the money . [ Skinner ] we 've got no way of contacting him . Not without blowing his cover . You 've got no choice . We had surveillance tapes satellited to us . There have been 27 robberies in seven eastern states , all this morning . No sign of mulder . Well , he 's gotta be on there somewhere . [ Bremer ] we have made some decisions . Take it and get out of here . I don 't wanna see your face again . Go . - On your feet . - I don 't need a car . You can just call me a cab . - Let 's go . - Go where ? [ Grunts ] Witnessing the murder of a federal agent will make these men an accessory to the crime . Did you hear that ? I wouldn 't miss it for the world . [ Bremer ] stop there . Down on your knees . Hands behind your back . [ Pistol chamber clicks , gunshot ] [ Sighs ] There 's a car for you just over the rise . Head south till you get to the highway . Who are you ? Go on . They come out here and find us , they 'll kill us both . [ Whispers ] go . Hey ! Hold it ! Hold it ! Who are you ? F.B.I. Who 's in charge ? Who 's in charge ? I need everybody out of the bank . - Mulder ! - They sprayed the money ! We got here an hour ago , before any of the funds were touched or transferred . The cash supply is being isolated , it 's being locked down in the vault . [ Dispatcher on radio ] code 415 . How did you know it was this bank ? I recognized you from the surveillance tape . Your finger . August bremer , or whatever his real name is ? He 's working with us . Before you go any further , you should know that the biotoxin they used ... may have come from government labs . Ourgovernment . You 're saying i was set up ? You have no definitive information to justify that position . I was being used ? This whole operation ? The people that died in that theater ? Agent mulder . Our government is not in the business of killing innocent civilians . The hell they aren 't . Those were tests on us to be used on someone else . Those bills have been analyzed . The money in the vault gave no readings . There 's absolutely no evidence of any biotoxins . So before you climb on any bandwagon- - You knew about this all along . You knew about this the whole time ! I want that money rechecked . That money has been cleared . It 's being used as evidence in a federal crime . That money 's as dirty as you are , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? Say that were true . Then what do you hope to accomplish , agent mulder , as a whistle-Blower ? To mobilize a civil rights action ? To bring down the federal government ? To do the very work that that group you were a part of is so bent on doing ? Whatdoyou want ? Laws against those men , or laws protecting them ? I want people to know the truth . Well , sometimes our job is to protect those people from knowing it . Excuse me . [ Horn blaring ] [ Horn continues blaring ] [ Child ] i made this .

Lucy doesn 't calculate ? You can 't do it 3 days a month . No , it can be more than 3 days a month . It 's not reliable . And it depends how long the sperm lives ... lt 's not by month. lt 's by cycle . How long do sperm stay alive ? I don 't know . 3 days ... My eyes whisper words of blue , You dummies , cut it out ! Seriously , how does it start ? Six o 'clock , the church bells chime The flowers seem to speak in rhyme Soon she 'll be coming out of City Hall When she smiles at me , I 'm in her thrall lf l don 't talk to her tonight , I 'm gonna bawl !

There 's no way out . It 's a dead end . More and more people think so . It 's Fat Boy Slim ! Come on , guys ! Let 's dance ! Why should I dance ? - Fat Boy Slim . - Fuck Fat Boy Slim . They left the fridge open . Come and dance ! Come on , tonight of all nights ! Dumb shit ! The potato chips ! It 's 2000 ! Fuck the chips ! I 'm dancing . Won 't you come dance ? Let me sweep up first . Shit , man ! I 'm like a mutt in bitch heaven ! What do you think of that girl ? Don 't look ! - She 's a bimbo . - A bimbo ? She 's no bimbo . I like my women ... to look like real women . Check this out . What 's up ? - ls Billoute here ? - l haven 't seen him . He said he 'd get here early . Beats me ... Come on ... I want to take off my coat . - We 'll come along . - Leave them ! 1 5 more minutes ! The year 2000 ! You 're off to some start . I 'm trying to be cool because I 'm the host . In there . Not here ! I have no condoms . Lucky us . What ? What a drag . No rubbers . I want a baby . Don 't say that ! It 's the right time . It 's one of your fertile days ? Wait a second ... - Don 't freak . - l 'm not . I need to think . Don 't think . Fourteen , thirteen ... Wait ... Five , four , three ... two ... one ... No ! Excuse me . It 's stupid ... lt 's really stupid ... I wanted it to be tonight . I couldn 't , just like that . Why tonight ? I just wanted ... to start something new on January 1 , 2000 . It 's stupid , but I was into it . I may not want a child . I do . You could have told me . What for ? What would you have said ? Not now ... not so soon ... No money. I need a better job . It 's tough . Don 't blame me for unemployment . Oh yeah . Unemployment , recession , pollution . Lousy world , no future . Same old story . That 's not it ... I don 't know ... lt 's a bad time . Let 's wait . Wait for what ? To think it over ! Keep thinking and Happy New Year . Great start ! You never think things over . Try this . lndustrial-strength stuff . Just one hit . Philip ... There 's tons of sand in the bathroom . There 's tons of sand in the bathroom . Chill out ... We 'll clean up tomorrow . Can I have an ashtray ? Over there ... or in the kitchen . Don 't look , he 's coming . Not just in the suburbs ! I teach in Paris . They don 't do any work . Kids spend more time watching TV than in school . It acts as a counter-culture . The level 's never been lower . It 's disastrous ! Billoute , I don 't know where the hell you are . Too bad you missed midnight . Here 's the address again . 99 Rue de Courcelles . Second floor . At the Vidals ' . I hope you come soon . I miss you ... Anybody home ? Anybody home ? What the hell ... ? Excuse me ... Where are we ? Sorry , we 're not from around here . Want some chicken ? No . - For how many ? - Five . It 's quite a shock . It 's all coming back ... lt 's incredible . You 're so young . I 'm Ako . - You 're a what ? - Ako . You can 't understand . You want a drink ? Come on , let 's go have a drink . There 's a bar over there on the roof . Sit down ... - What 'll it be ? - Two beers . Leffe , Heineken , Kronenbourg ? Two Buds . Amazing ... Strange , isn 't it ? You 're mistaken . I was at the Vidals ' . Clotilde and Philip 's party . The plastic bag ... - Hold on , sir . - One thing at a time . First the pictures . Look . This one . - Who 's that ? - lt 's you ! That 's Lucy . She was about 20 then , right ? See that ? Where did you get these ? Keep looking . I like this one . But ... - You ? - Yes . I 'm your son . This one you have to see . Shit , Dad ! - Here ? - Perfect . Wake up . We 're here . Get up ! It 's magic ... Here he is ! It 's Gramps ! Lucky you ! For once we 're all here ! I don 't believe it . Michel and Artemisia have 3 children : Celestin , Claudine and Tom . It must be overwhelming ... This is Juliette , my other daughter . She and Achilles have 5 : Noham , Loubna , Youssef , Virginia and Moutiou . Gramps ! We roasted some pigeons and chickens . They 're almost done . Some chicken ! And now the prettiest of all : Marie-Jeanne , my wife . Damn , he looks just like you ! And me ? Am I invisible ? We 're coming ... I can 't walk , but that 's no reason . Madeleine ... This has been a bad month for her . Dad ? It 's good to see you . Remember me ? Cut it out ! He hasn 't even had you yet ! He just got here ... She 's my sister . Your daughter . She 's wonderful . I 've seen snow ! Her life 's been tough . She was a real adventuress . I 've seen snow ! Shall we eat ? They 're expecting me downstairs . I should go ... No ! - Thanks anyway . - What about my chicken ? I 've been cooking for hours . What do you mean , " l should go " ? You 're staying here . You can 't always slip away . Too easy ! I haven 't been conceived , but I won 't shut up . - Keep cool , Ako . - Butt out ! I 'm old enough to speak my mind . Because ... it 's like when I wanted to go into turkeys . You were against it : " No future in turkeys ! " You know how much I make with turkeys ? You can add a zero ! " l should go ... " No . " l stay ! " " l face my responsibilities . I listen to my son . " - Me ? - Not you . This is no way ... - lt 's no way ... - You said ... What did you say ? That I 'd take off my socks . Take them off , Dad . Yes , honey . Take off your socks . Or he 'll never understand . Should I ? Take off your socks ? It just started . It 's speeding up . See ? Shit . Wow . Gramps is here already ? Take his pulse . Dad ? Jean-Claude , help me ! Just a second . Ulysses , where were you this morning ? Weren 't you on ostrich duty ? Relax. I was with Blandine . I 'll do it tomorrow . is it today or tomorrow ? Yeah , right . On the bed . That Ulysses is such a procrastinator ! Careful . Where the hell is Blandine ? I don 't know . Out living her life . It 's moving up my leg . Want some ointment ? - On what ? - On your gap . Sure ... Ointment ! Calm down ! Stop being a pain . I 'm trying to help . You said to be nice and you 're barking orders . What can I do ? He treats me like a stranger . Next he 'll be calling me " sir " . Daddy ... Feeling better ? Shit ! - Dad ! - Come back ! Where are you going ? Okay ... Let 's say I 'm your son . My father . My father . Yeah , whatever . And that they 're all your family . Mine too . Let 's just skip that part ... What do you want ? - l want to exist . - We want to exist . Think of the children . Our children . We all want to exist . You have to make me today . And Madeleine in 3 years . We 'll do the rest . What ? You and Mom made me on January 1 , 2000 . Go back down and say you 're sorry . " l thought it over , went to the future , " saw our son , and he talked me into it . " He should live. I 'm proud of him . " What do I know ? I don 't know you ! Exactly . Getting to know us will help you decide . You know , this may sound stupid , but ... the problem with what doesn 't exist , with the unknown , is that we don 't know it . If we knew the unknown , then ... No , no ... I really don 't think so . Why not ? Children ... for the time being , I don 't want children . And bringing a child into today 's world is irresponsible . Today 's world ! Which world ? You don 't know today 's world ! It 's all new to you . Stick around . Talk to people . Get to know us . We 're not monsters , you know . Silly me ... Seeing you makes me see things differently . To think of it , it 's something I never thought about . I never thought about it . Good idea ... Why not have children after all ? I 'll go back home ... I 'll talk it over with ... that mother of yours . We 'll work something out . Not a bad idea . - lt worked ... - l 'm not so sure . I don 't think so . Gramps ! Hurry up ! Do you know where Avenue Wagram is ? No . Rue de Courcelles ? Sorry , no . A square with a market . There 's a market that way . Dad ! Gramps ! Let go of me ! Let go ! Calm down , Gramps ! - You okay , Lucy ? - Yeah . What 's wrong ? Nothing , why ? Hello . Have you seen Arthur ? A little while ago . He went to the bathroom . Okay . Shit ... lt 's normal . Let him get used to it . He hasn 't eaten a thing . I thought seeing you would change everything . Appeal to his emotions . He 's your father . How do I do that ? Use yourself . Your memories . Things in his future that he may like . Easier said than done . Think again . It 's hard to drown a kitten . I don 't get it . Drown what ? Anything with its life ahead of it . You grow attached . To what ? Come on ! To kittens ! I see . I 'm the kitten ? Take it easy , Dad . I don 't know how to say this ... We all need a little ... tenderness . Affection . Love . We 're all little kittens . What ? Motherfucker ! Old crackpot ! Forget the kitten strategy . Listen up . I 've had enough of Gramps ! Just make him screw Granny ! Enough , Jean-Claude . I want you to calm down ! Gramps , I know why you 're scared about having a child . But children are love . They 're life . Does that sound ridiculous ? Totally ridiculous ! For you , parenthood is out of date . Right ? That 's too easy . You can 't just write off parenthood . That 's so amazingly immature . At some point , you have to take on responsibilities . Just a minute , Virginia . I 'm talking to Gramps . I 'll be right there . Where was I ? If you put it that way , I sound totally stupid and moralistic . But there comes a time when you can 't bury your head like an ostrich . I 'm no ostrich ... How can I explain it ? If you look back and see lots of beautiful things which ... which you owe to your children . Come help me ! I 'm coming , dammit ! Virginia , stop screaming . I 'm talking with Gramps ! Come on ! Damn ! I 'm at a loss for words . " ... but what draws together two people of the opposite sex " so powerfully and exclusively " is the desire to live inherent in the entire species , " anticipating an objectification of its existence " in line with its intentions in the individual these beings create . " Good. I think ... I got through . We 're making progress . Come on ... Don 't look so glum . With frowns like that , I wouldn 't make you ! What can we do ? Why won 't you have children ? Tell me ! Why won 't you do it ? Guess who we 're going to see ? Leave Gramps alone . You promise not to yell ? Matthew . He 's here ? You 'll see . He has a great house in the suburbs . You used to take me and Madeleine there for weekends . We loved it . We liked Matthew a lot . That strange girlfriend of his too . He never had children because of their situation . He always regretted it . He 'll tell you about it . I 'll drop you off and head back . I have another client . We 're in a rush too . Put the pedal to the metal . Matthew ? He can 't be far . Matthew ? He doesn 't recognize me . Normal . He 's blind . Matthew , it 's me . Arthur . Louder . He 's 94 years old . Matthew ! Arthur 's here to see you . Shit ... I think he 's dead . I 'm sick of this shit ! What the hell am I doing here in the armpit of the universe ? What for ? To come see my friend the mummy ! I don 't know that guy . Matthew 's down there . He 's 28 years old . He 's partying and I 'm joining him ! Wrong way . Stop treating me like an asshole . I get it now . I 'm going back to the party . - Before you go ... - l 'm going to party . Dad ! Leave me alone ! Come on ... It 's not my fault . I had no idea he 'd be dead . I thought you 'd like to see your pal . He sure lived far away . Did you bring any water by chance ? And me , am I dead ? Change the subject . It 's best you don 't know . No , why ? Not at all ... - You died on the ... - No , no , okay . Wait , it 's best I don 't know . Go ahead ... You died in 2021 ... on June 1 6th . 46 years old . Shit ! I died really young . I never imagined ... How ? What did I die of ? No , I can 't tell you that . You can 't tell me ? Was it serious ? No ... just at the end . The last 1 0 years were pure hell . But they were harder on the rest of us . You were too far gone to realize . You definitely suffered . But it was purely physical . However , when they started amputating ... I was just kidding ! Very funny . You died a normal death . No reason to get spooked . I 'm the one who 's spooked ? You bet ! You 're not spooked by your disappearing legs ? I don 't want to be here . I do . Oh yeah ? Well , forget it . You 're not going anywhere . I won 't make you . You won 't make me ? I didn 't hear that . Why ? Are your ears disappearing too ? I may be going about this all wrong ... All I can say is maybe you died young , but I ... I never really knew you . I was 21 . Now I see you again ... I don 't know ... I never could talk to you . Even as a kid , I didn 't know how . I always felt like you didn 't care . Not at all ... Which way ? That way . With children ... only the first two years are tough . When they start talking , it 's magic . I said two years , but ... after a year , when they start walking , it 's the same . Incredibly cute . They 're independent early on . I can 't go any further . Can you go get a cab ? Yes ? This is a grocery ? Taxi ! They 're back ! What happened ? So ? - l don 't know . - You don 't know ? I need to think . - To think ? - Relax , Jean-Claude . Leave him . It 's good he 's thinking . Moutiou ! What 's this ? Why are you tied up ? Can you take him ? I was playing with the five of them . Moutiou tied me up . Don 't let them do that . You shouldn 't let them get away with everything . A father must set limits . That 's your job . I can 't always be setting limits . Too many limits is bad . A few can help . Lucy ? No , I 'm Blandine . I 'm Jean-Claude 's daughter . Ako 's granddaughter . Lucy was my great-grandmother . We look alike ? Yeah . Made up your mind ? Granny said you hadn 't . Yeah , no ... I totally understand . You 're young . I feel the same way . I 'm not ready yet either . I want to experience things . Oh yeah ? - Do I think ? - No . What 's wrong ? Shit ... Gramps ! Dad 's going to kill you ! Me ? Why ? Don 't think ! Come on ! Let 's go to the basement ! Wait up , Gramps ! I 'll help you to decide ! You 'll screw Granny , believe it ! Are you nuts ? Come here and I 'll show you ! - This way . - Follow us . Faster ! This way . Dad ! Stop ! Don 't shoot , Dad . Don 't , it 's me . Open up , Ulysses ! I 'm losing my arm . I 'll teach that asshole to decide ! Calm down . Think it over . No use killing him . You don 't realize you 'll disappear too ! I 'll stall him . When he 's like this , there 's no stopping him . Open up or I 'll blow your brains out ! Come on ! Ulysses , let 's talk this over . I was young once , I know what you 're feeling . We 'll head up . I 'll help you get home . You may think I 'm a jerk . If you have children , you 'll see ... it 's easy to be a jerk . Fighting me won 't change anything . Shut the fuck up ! Shut up ? Watch your mouth ! I don 't want the family to disappear . I 'm not stupid. I won 't kill him . I just want to scare him . Open up ... Will you calm down ? Yeah , come on ... Open up . You let them leave . Yes . Little shit . Are you stupid or what ? Violence won 't help ! If he 's dead , he can 't make me . Think a little ! Did talking get you anywhere ? So stop preaching . I 'll try my way . I 'm disappearing too . Antique dealers ? They bring up stuff from under the sand . Ready ! By the way ... when you said you wanted to experience things before having children ... I meant sexually . You never wanted to try stuff with someone besides Lucy ? Yeah . Me too . I don 't know how people can decide on one person to have children with . It 's scary , isn 't it ? Yeah , yeah , it 's scary . Super scary . Shit , it 's Dad ! He 's totally nuts ! I 've never seen him like this . Not existing must really stir things up for him . Let 's get help . So ? He must have made it down . He 's dead meat ! Cool it , Jean-Claude . Listen to your mother . Go home . Your father will work it out . Yeah , I 'll work it out . I love it when it burns ... Have you seen Bob ? No , I haven 't . Are you staying ? No , I have to find Bob . Wait ... What are you doing ? Have you seen Arthur ? Lucy ? Do I know you ? Why are you staring at me ? You look like my mother . Do I ? is that some kind of compliment ? - l 'm looking for Arthur . - Me too , but ... He 's not here ? I think so , but I can 't find him . You work together ? Yes , yes , that 's right . Sorry , I 'm a little ... Maybe he 's in the kitchen . The kitchen ? - Where is it ? - That way . - Excuse me . - My fault . Where 's Lucy going ? Why are you staring at me ? Because ... you remind me of my father . Do I ? What fucking nerve , Billoute ! Standing me up tonight ! You 're the stupid one . He 's 1 8 . What do you expect ? You 're right . I 'm finished cradle-robbing . It 's so weird ... that I look like your mother . It 's weird for me too . I loved my mother . She was so ... Are you crying ? Don 't cry ... Go on . Ask him to dance . She won 't care . Don 't cry . Want something to drink ? I 'll be right back . You 're feeling better ? Want to dance ? No , I have to find my father . Your father ? No , Arthur . He knows where your father is ? Yes , no , actually ... Let 's dance . The family 's looking for you . Gramps went down . Gramps ? You mean Ako ? Isn 't Blandine with you ? She 's over there with " whoozit " ... Bob . I 'll take you on Scooter . Come on . - This is Scooter ? - Yeah . is she a two-seater ? You knew Boris Vian ? He was from the 50s . I 'm from the 90s . - l heard the 90s were cool ! - How do you know ? My books . Yeah ? So was it cool then ? Yeah , I 'll say . They 're still there . Can I come along ? No , Ulysses . Things are screwed up enough . And , I don 't know how to get there . I have an idea . Hide in there . It 's a caf辿 . Go on ! Dad ! Granny ! - l found him ! - Where ? At the Groove ! Bye , Gramps . Thanks . I looked all over . I thought you 'd left . I meant to ask ... Not now. I have to ... Where were you ? With Blandine. I mean Ulysses . - l 'll leave you two . - Do that . is Ulysses that old guy ? No . He 's ... An old guy asked for you . An old guy ? What did he say ? - We danced . - You two danced ? He was strange . He cried over his mother . Jesus ... What did you do ? I let Rosemonde console him . Wait ... And ... I 've been thinking . I 'd like us to talk . Wait , I have to find this guy because ... What are you doing ? Rosemonde , butt out . Off the table ! Get down from there ! Calm down . Go home now . Are you crazy ? Please , don 't interfere . But Dad , I just wanted to say goodbye . I couldn 't up there . You can 't imagine ... seeing you and Mom ... He 's ... - Who ? - No one . - l 'm family . - Sure . Time for bed ... I can 't find the words . We 're so far away , but for me you 're close . I remember ... It 's all coming back now ... The vacations , the picnics ... Christmas in the sand . The turkeys . Daddy ! Mommy ! It 's bedtime . He can 't hold his liquor . I can drop him off . I 'll take the car . No , he doesn 't need a ride ... Come on . Move it ! Charles invited me . - No Charles here . - Pierre then . No Pierre either . - What 's your name ? - Clotilde . You told me to come . Sorry , we 're full up . Where 's Gramps ? No Gramps here . Don 't bother . Millenium doesn 't mean open house . It 's Matthew . He 's just a kid ! Open up ! Turn it off . - What ? - Turn it off . The music ? You 're sick ! These are killer vibes ! Screw the vibes ! Have you lost it ? Stop ! Attention , please ! I 'm sorry ! I 'll get the keys . I know what I 'm doing . Sorry to be a party-pooper , but it 's too crowded . I 'm asking you nicely : if you weren 't invited , be nice and leave . You 've gone too far ! Seriously , there are limits ... lt 's out of control . We 're here to have fun . 2000 only comes once . Yes ? Fucking hell ! Hey . I want to live . Ulysses does too . Me too . You 'll screw Granny ! Let go of me ! I want to live ! You weren 't invited . Arthur , you know him ? No , I mean yes . You 'll get to know me . I just want to exist . Then I 'll go home . No , go home now ! It 's 2000 . We 're just joking around . No big deal . It is a big deal ! You go too ! Screw you all ! This is my only millenium party ! Philip ! Philip , come help me ! Wait , just let me pull myself together . Clotilde , chill out . Yeah , it 's 2000 . Fuck the year 2000 ! It 's Mom and Dad 's place ! Why is the carpet soaked ? I 'll go look . I feel better now . Who are they ? I don 't know them ! Me neither. lf they leave , we 'll never know them ! He may be a friend . What if he 's my son ? Yeah . I don 't know my son either . I want to . You don 't know the unknown . Ready for the future ? Look at you ! Think you 'll live on Mars ? Look ! You see that kid there ? My great-grandson . He wasn 't invited ! There 's wine . Sand everywhere ! All over the toilet ! And there 'll be lots more sand ! And it 's no big deal ! What the fuck ... ? Kader ! Clotilde ! Get out ! Get out ! What the hell ? Don 't talk to my father that way ! My sledgehammer ! My sledgehammer ... lt 's not ... I tried to say so but no one listened . What 's wrong ? What happened ? Let 's go . Hold on ... We 're going to the bathroom . That did me good . You have to go . You can 't stay here . Dad , can you give me a hand ? I know I 'm heavy but ... try to understand. I want to live . Jean-Claude too . And Artemisia . And Juliette , Claudine , and Tom ... And Sophie , Virginia and ... What 's his name ? - Moutiou ! - Yeah , Moutiou . Will you think it over ? Who was that guy ? Your son . Very funny . It 's no big deal . What 's no big deal ? What happened earlier . If you 're not ready , we 'll wait . Let 's not fight about it . You 're right . We 'll wait ... Because money-wise ... Billoute , if you didn 't get my other messages , I hope you get this one because ... I wanted to say you 're a jerk-off . Keep jerking off . It 's what you do best . I won 't say goodbye . So long . Why are you staring at me ? Anyway , we 're not in a rush . So it 's no big deal . You think so ? If you think about it ... Yeah ... What a night today was ! What 'll it be ? A coffee . It 's crazy how much you look like Mom ! Will Arthur be coming back up ? No . Your hair 's full of sand . Wait , I 'll be right back . I 'm going ... I came to tell you ... I spoke with Lucy . She agrees the time 's not right . I feel bad for all of you , but ... lt 's for the best . If you think it over , Lucy has to get a raise . I need a better job . For the time being , I 'm just a trainee . I make 5600 francs gross . That means 4500 net . We pay 3800 in rent . You can 't understand all this ... lt 's not much . It 's for you too . If we can 't give you the basics , what children need ... schooling , toys ... Toys ? Don 't they need toys ? Sure they do . So there ... No hard feelings ? What ? Nothing . Excuse me. I 'm sorry . Don 't forget your gun . You want some help ? Thanks . You don 't mind ? So long . Thanks . Hold on . My sledgehammer 's inside . Do you need any help ? No , it 's okay . I 'll get my ski jacket .

If you want , you can come by for a drink ... Yeah ... You came by scooter . Yeah , but it 's no problem . She 's on the roof . I tied her up . Bob will come and give her some hay . Okay ...

You 're leaving with Nathalie ? Bye , Clotilde . Thanks . Happy New Year . Happy New Year . I don 't remember a thing . I 'll give you something to remember . See you . Why are you still here ?

A fresh start ? Yeah , a fresh start . Starting in 2000 . What are you thinking about ? If it 's a boy , we 'll call him " Ako " . Why Ako ? Why not ? Maybe . See that ? Sand ... Yeah ...

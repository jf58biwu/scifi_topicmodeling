 Auntie Janet ? It 's time , Auntie Janet . He 's waiting . We should hurry . We have papers to sign . Just tell me when . Don 't you cry for me , dear . I 'm tired of the pain . You 're my angel of mercy . Is she gone ? Something 's wrong here . Vassily Peskow ? Prisoner . Hey ! Prisoner I thought maybe you were dead . How long have I been lying here ? Hours . I don 't know . The first time is bad . Very bad . - They 've done this to you ? - Yes . It becomes easier each time , until it kills you . What did they do to me ? You have been exposed to the black cancer . - What cancer ? - The cancer that lives in the rock . Who are you ? I was a geologist . Quite well known in my field , actually , ... .. but now I am just a test subject . You helped them find the rock ? I was there when they brought up the first fragments . This was before the mining . Before we knew what lived in Tunguska rock . How many men have died here ? Hundreds . Maybe more . The search for a cure goes slowly . Is that what they say the tests are for , to find a cure ? No , no . They tell us nothing . We are left to guess or imagine the reasons for our torture . But what else could it be ? What happened to the man who was in the cell with me - Krycek ? He is most likely dining with the men responsible for our torture . I heard laughter when they left your cell . - I 'm not gonna die . - No ? Why not ? I have to live long enough to kill that man Krycek . - Where 'd you get this ? - I made it ... to kill myself . It took me nearly two weeks . By then I had lost the desire . You 'd rather suffer the torture ? It is wonderful , the persistence of life . That rock we found buried so deep in the earth , ... .. that anything could survive down there against all reason ... No . They will have to kill me themselves . We haven 't been able to give him anything but fluids for 48 hours . It doesn 't help that he 's in a restricted environment . Well , if he has been infected by some kind of organism , we can 't risk contamination . Are you seeing anything ? The blood in the carotid artery looks slightly thickened , ... .. possibly due to the decreased heart rate and blood pressure . Now what 's this ? What the hell is this ? What is it ? I don 't know . It looks like it 's concentrated around his pineal body . - I think it 's alive ! - It looks like a nest . Some kind of black vermiform organism attached to the pineal gland . - Apple ? - No . Thank you very much , though . Oh , pardon me . - Who are you ? - As a boy , my father had a farm , ... .. but not horses like these . My name is Vassily Peskow . Mr Peskow , ... .. I 'm sorry , but you don 't belong in here . I am sorry , very sorry . You are going to have to leave here . I 'm going to call you a cab . But I have come here to see you , Dr Charne-Sayre . - Do I know you ? - No . I don 't know how you could . Agent Scully . - Sir , what ... ? - I 've been trying to contact you for hours . - The better part of a day ! - My cell phone was turned off . You owe me some answers - answers I don 't have to the questions I 'm being asked ... .. about this missing diplomatic pouch . The pouch presumably carried by the man who was pushed off my balcony , ... .. and whose connection to the known felon I harboured in my house ... .. I 'll have to explain to avoid perjuring myself before a Senate subcommittee . Which is a serious crime in itself , is it not , Agent Scully ? Yes , sir . Sir , if I might explain . The contents of that pouch - it contained some kind of a biohazardous organism ... .. that is in a contamination laboratory at NASA Goddard , ... .. which is where I 've been , trying to determine its exact nature . That pouch , do you know what its intended destination was ? - No , sir , I don 't . - Well , I do , Agent Scully , ... .. because I bent some rules this morning to find out who was to receive it . - Who was it ? - Dr Bonita Charne-Sayre . - Are you familiar with that name ? - Yes , sir . She 's a well-known physician . A virologist who 's looked in on presidents . She 's also an authority on ... on variola viruses . - Variola ? - Smallpox . She 's been a vocal proponent ... .. of eliminating the last remaining stores of the smallpox virus , ... .. destroying the only remaining vials here in Atlanta and in the former Soviet Union . - Well , she was killed tonight . - Killed ? A horse stepped on her throat in a riding accident in Virginia . Where are we going ? Prisoner ... is that your friend ? You have but one chance . That 's a nasty habit . It 's bad for the health . Health is the least of my concerns at the moment . Yes . According to reports , your ... .. personal physician suffered a serious riding accident here on your property . Dr Charne-Sayre was murdered . By whom ? If I knew , do you think I 'd be standing here talking to you ? So ... You need me now . A man of my capabilities , is that it ? This was a professional hit . Really ? And you out here all alone and so vulnerable . Were you sleeping with her ? Surely you wouldn 't be so foolish as to put the project at risk ... .. for the sake of your personal pleasures . Find her killer . - Call off this Congressional investigation . - I can 't . But Senator Sorenson is an honourable man . They are all honourable , ... .. these honourable men . I heard Mulder was captured in Tunguska . I hear now he 's escaped . Wake the Russian bear , and it may find we 've stolen its honey . No ! I 'm sorry . I , Dana Katherine Scully , ... .. swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ... .. and nothing but the truth , so help me , God . I would like to read from a prepared statement . You may do so . " I left behind a career in medicine to become an FBI agent four years ago ... .. because I believed in this country . " " I wanted to uphold its laws , to punish the guilty and to protect the innocent . " " I still believe in this country . " " But I believe there are powerful men in this government who do not . " " Men who have no respect for the law and who flout it with impunity . " Ms Scully ... " I have come to the conclusion that it is no longer possible ... " This is not a soapbox , Ms Scully . Your statement will be entered into the record . With respect , I would like to finish . - This is not why we are here today . - Then why are we here , sir ? Do you or do you not know the whereabouts of Agent Mulder ? Are you or are you not aware of Agent Mulder 's present location ? I respectfully refuse to answer that question , sir . Agent Scully , you cannot refuse to answer that question . I believe answering that question could endanger Agent Mulder 's life . You don 't seem to understand . Your response is not optional . You are an agent of the FBI . Then if I may please finish my statement . " .. that it is no longer possible for me to carry out my duties as an FBI agent . " Are you tendering your resignation , Agent Scully ? Is that what you 're trying to say ? No , sir . What I am saying is that there is a culture of lawlessness ... .. that has prevented me from doing my job . That the real target of this investigation ... .. should be the men who are beyond prosecution and punishment . The men whose secret policies are behind the crimes that you are investigating . You have a legal obligation to answer the questions posed to you . Tell us what you know about Agent Mulder 's whereabouts , ... .. or you 'll be held in contempt of Congress . - No Russian . - American ? Tell your husband I 'm sorry about his truck . The test ? Yeah . - They kill everybody for the test . - Why don 't they kill you ? My husband makes deliveries . They spare our lives . But now , no truck . He is afraid . - Well , I have to go now . - No . - They 'll come looking for me , and for you . - No ! - There are other ways . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . Grisha ! No arm ... no test . You don 't understand . These tests , this smallpox scar on your arm , ... .. it 's some kind of identification . You have to help me escape . I 'll help you escape . You have to help me get to St Petersburg . - You holding up ? - I 've got plenty to read . I can understand you protecting Agent Mulder , but ... It is not just Agent Mulder that I am protecting , sir . Then what are you doing ? We were called before this committee to answer questions about a murder , ... .. about an intercepted diplomatic pouch that was to be delivered to a prominent doctor , ... .. a woman who is now dead , as is the man who was delivering the said pouch , ... .. the contents of which have infected an exobiologist with a paralyzing toxin . Yet what are we stuck on here ? - The whereabouts of Agent Mulder . - You mean it 's the wrong question . Several of the men on this committee are lawyers . It is my experience that lawyers ask the wrong question ... .. when they don 't want the right answer . Unless Agent Mulder has found the answers they 're looking for . Or someone wants to make sure he doesn 't find them . These are congressmen we 're talking about . I know that , sir , and it is my natural inclination to believe ... .. that they are acting in the best interest of the truth , ... .. but I am not inclined to follow my own judgment in this case . So you 're gonna follow Agent Mulder 's . Is that it ? His name is Vassily Peskow . He was a KGB Line-X stringer working out of Moscow Center . But how could this be ? How could the Russians know we were working on our own inoculation ? - Six of us knew ! - Dr Charne-Sayre ? She was trusted . Absolutely . Then I don 't know . Find this man ! Find him ! If my intelligence sources are right , ... .. I think there 's someone who might save us the trouble . - Mr Chairman , may I ? - Carry on . Miss Scully , you 've had a good long time ... .. to think about the question that was asked in our last session . I want to give you the opportunity to answer that question here today ... .. so I can help our good chairman here ... .. to get on with this proceeding . I can 't answer that question , sir . I 'm going to ask you again . Where is Special Agent Mulder and why is he not here ? I 'll answer your questions about the man carrying the pouch . - Agent Scully ! - About his murder ... .. and my opinion about its connection to the death of Dr Bonita Charne-Sayre . Miss Scully , you 'll get your chance ... - Or about the biotoxin within that pouch . - Answer the question , Miss Scully ! What is the question ? All right , let 's come to order . Agent Scully , do continue . Yes , sir , if I may , I would like to finish making my point . What is your point , Miss Scully ? That the death of Dr Charne-Sayre , given her field of expertise , ... .. suggests that she knew something about the toxin , about its origins , ... .. and that knowledge may be linked ... .. to the murder of the man in Assistant Director Skinner 's apartment building . Miss Scully ? Yes , sir . AD Skinner has informed me that there has been an accident related ... An accident ? A doctor infected with the toxin has died under suspicious circumstances ... .. involving a theft of evidence ... .. of the contents of the diplomatic pouch . Well , we 've gotten off to a real fine start here . I 'm going to recess now until this new matter can be explained ... .. so we might then begin moving in a forward direction . Mulder ... I get to put my arms around you . - Both of ' em . - When did you get back ? - It 's been a long , strange trip . - Some other time . There 's been enough strangeness here . I 've made several connections about what this toxin might be . - So have I. - Sir , I need your permission ... .. to book two airfares to Boca Raton , Florida . It shouldn 't take more than 12 , 15 hours . But if it does , I need you to stall the committee tomorrow for the purpose of ... If you explain it to me , Agent Scully , I 'm gonna have to explain it to them . I suggest you do everything in your power to make it back for tomorrow 's session ... .. or I can 't help you . Boca Raton ? Dr Bonita Charne-Sayre is a board member ... .. and chief physician for a chain of elder-care convalescent hospitals around the country . Guess what one of her patients died of in Boca Raton ? - Yes , what is it ? - Agents Mulder And Scully . We need your permission to speak with you or any of your patients . - What about ? - May we come in ? Yes . - When were these patients last checked ? - An hour ago , at bed check . - This man 's dead . - What ? Scully ! These people are test subjects . I think they 've been poisoned . Who gave these patients their meds tonight ? I did . OK , call 911 . Tell them you 've got a quarantine of a biohazardous material . Show us all of the entrances of the hospital . We 've got to seal this building immediately . I don 't understand what you hope to learn here . Everything that 's happened , every death we 've seen can be traced back to one man . But according to you , that man is in Russia or possibly even dead . Well , he isn 't working alone . Terry Edward Mayhew ? Can we talk with you ? Have a little off-the-record chat ? - About ? - Alex Krycek . - Who ? - The man who set you up . You and the members of your militia . Name wasn 't Krycek . It was Arntzen or somethin ' like that . You met him in North Dakota , salvaging material from a missile silo . I never been in no missile silo . I don 't know nothin ' about that . This man Krycek , or " Arntzen , " as you call him , how did he come into contact with you ? Off the record . He came to us with some building materials and some big ideas . - What was he looking to build ? - Two ... .. devices . - Did he ever mention black cancer ? - Oh , yeah . - What did he say ? - Developed by the Soviets . Saddam used it in the Gulf . You mean ... used as biowarfare ? That 's why they made those servicemen take all them pills . US government knew about the black cancer . They lied . Didn 't have no cure , no inoculation . I think we 'll quit right there . I got nothin ' more to say . - Let 's go , Mulder . - You said there were ... two devices . What happened to the other bomb ? I ate it . - Mulder ! - You wanna know about anarchy ? You don 't tell me where that other bomb is , I 'll make sure you spend your prison time ... .. putting a big smile on some convict 's face . Son of a bitch stole it , truck and all . - Some storage garage . - Where ? Terma , North Dakota . Thank you . Get the license numbers for any two-ton trucks stolen in North Dakota recently . Have Canadian authorities stop any vehicle fitting that description . - Tell them they 're looking for a bomb . - What are you doing ? This has been a big setup from the beginning . Someone used Krycek , then Krycek used us . Someone who didn 't want that rock in US hands . But what 's in Canada ? Where would you put this rock if you didn 't want it to be found ? Back in the ground . Fertilizer Fertilizer for my hothouse tomatoes . Beautiful tomatoes all year , eh ? Thanks . Go back to the refinery . See if you can find anybody that knows about that truck . I would just as soon kill you , but please don 't make me . My work is done . Mulder ! I 'd like to get started here . - Miss Scully ? - Yes , I 'm ready here , sir . You have evidence to present . This is what I 've been told . Yes , sir . Uh ... Evidence linking a number of deaths , a great number , ... .. to a biotoxin that was transported to US soil ... .. by a courier who was also killed . This was the man who was pushed from the assistant director 's apartment ? Yes . He has not been ID 'd . Do we have the name of the individual who pushed him ? Yes , sir . Alex Krycek , who is missing and possibly deceased . And are you then in possession of the pouch or its contents ? No , sir . What evidence are you then presenting us with today ? Documents and interviews ... .. in support of a wide-ranging conspiracy to control a lethal biotoxin ... .. that is , in fact , extraterrestrial . What , are we talking about little green men here ? - No , sir . Not at all . - Why is this so hard to believe ? When the accepted discovery of life off this planet is in every newspaper worldwide ? When even conservative scientists are calling for the exploration of Mars and Jupiter ? With every reason to believe that life is thriving outside our own terrestrial sphere ? If you cannot get past this , ... .. then I suggest this whole committee be held in contempt ... .. for ignoring evidence that cannot be refuted . This is not why we are here today . Then why are we here today ? I will suggest that we recess here until the evidence can be properly evaluated . I made this !

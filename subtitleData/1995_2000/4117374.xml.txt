 Come , come ! Please ! Aziz . Aziz . Aziz , light ! Aziz , light . Good . We start again . " When the three planets are in eclipse , the black hole , like a door , is open . Evil comes spreading terror and chaos . " See the snake , Billy ? The ultimate evil . - Make sure you get the snake . - Yes , I 've got your snakes . I got all the snakes . When is the snake act supposed to occur ? Well , if this is the five and this is the one ... . Every 5000 years . So I 've got some time , then . You bring them water . Good boy . I will take it to them . Go with God . Be safe from evil . You see here these different peoples , or symbols of people gathering together the four elements of life : water , fire , earth , air around a fifth one . A fifth element . Forgive me , lord . They already know too much . Father . How are you today ? - Well . You have some glasses ? - Of course . Father , I 'm so glad to see you . It 's the most extraordinary thing . It 's the greatest find in history . You must be parched . Oh , yes , yes . I 'm sorry . It 's like a battle plan . Here , the good . Here , the evil . And here , a weapon against evil . I 'm going to be famous . Then let us toast to your fame . To fame . Salute . You can 't drink a toast with water . Billy , in my sack , the grappa . This I don 't understand . This could be something prehistoric . I don 't know . But wait . Here . Look , look . They 're here . This man this perfect being . I know this is the key . I know it . This divine light they talk about . What is divine light ? Aziz , light ! Much better . Thank you . My lord . Father , this is the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen . Don 't you think ... ? Are you German ? Lord , I know he was about to discover everything . But there is no worry . I was there in time . Priest , you and those before you have served us well . But war is coming . Stones not safe on Earth anymore . This is really amazing . The fifth element . Take the stones . My lord if you take the weapon , we 'll be defenceless when evil returns . In 300 years , when evil returns so shall we . Oh , professor . Professor . Don 't move ! I have a gun ! Please , understand . They 're our friends . Friends ? Father , they 've killed the professor ! They 're monsters ! I 'll explain everything . - You 're with them ? - Look at me . I am your friend . - No , Father . - Billy , look at me ! Please , put the gun down . Billy , no ! Hurry ! The wall is closing ! Here is your mission : Pass your knowledge to the next priest as it was passed on to you . I will do as you command , but please , hurry , you still have time . Time not important . Only life important . I will fulfil my mission ! You can count on me ! I will pass the knowledge until your return . - Anything yet ? - No , sir . - Not even a temperature ? - The analysers have jammed . One shows a million degrees , the others minus 5000 . Let 's see it . It 's taking shape . Send out a probe . Ladies and gentlemen , the president of the Federated Territories . On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds . I saved this seat for you , Father . President on the line . We 're in position . I have to address the Supreme Council . Just the facts . There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet . All the calibres are overshot . We 're initiating thermonucleatic imaging . What you 're saying is , you don 't know what this is . All we know is , it just keeps getting bigger . Recommendation ? My philosophy is shoot first and ask questions later . I don 't like uninvited guests . - All right , then , Staedert- - - Mr . President ? Priest Vito Cornelius , expert of astrophenomenon . I have a different theory to offer you , sir . You have 20 seconds . Imagine that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be . Wherever there is life , it brings death ... - ... because it is evil . Absolute evil . - One more reason to shoot first . Evil begets evil , Mr. President . Shooting will only make it stronger . Probe will obtain objective in five seconds . Growth rate is at 27 % . Your theory is interesting , but we don 't have time . Time is of no importance . Only life is important . You 're right . That 's exactly what we 'll do . We 'll protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens . You may fire when ready . Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile . Marker lights on the objective . Its structure solidified on the surface . I think it 's anticipating the attack . That denotes intelligence . The most terrible intelligence imaginable , Mr. President . 120 's loaded . The ship is in combat formation . Missiles are loaded . - Staedert . - Yes , sir . - I have a doubt . - I don 't , Mr. President . What happened ? Can you hear me ? Staedert , what happened ? - Did you destroy it ? - I 'm about to , sir . The planet has increased diameter by 200 % . It 's moving towards the ship . What do we have that 's bigger than 240 ? Nothing , sir . Staedert , do you hear me ? Get out of there . I don 't want an incident . Do you hear me ? Get out of there . Can you hear me , Staedert ? Do you understand ? Listen . This is the president . That 's an order . Do you understand me ? Do you hear me ? Get out of there ! Good God ! Four a day . I 'm trying . To quit is my goal . I 'm up . All right , I 'm up . God . Hey , dog brain , Finger here . - Hi , sweetie . - I love you too . You haven 't called me that since basic training . - I was talking to the cat . - Oh , yeah , I forgot you prefer your cat to the real thing . At least the cat comes back . Still pining for that two-timing slut ? There 's millions out there . I don 't want a million women . I just want one . The perfect one . - It don 't exist , major . - Yeah , I know . - What ? - I just found a picture of you . - How do I look ? - Like shit . Must be an old picture . Bring me your hack for a six-month overhaul . - Negative . - ASAP . I don 't need one . Who sat next to you for 1000 missions ? I know how you drive . Finger , I drive a cab now , not a space fighter . Okay , so tell me . How many points you got left on your license ? Major , how many points ? At least 50 . Know what ? You gotta learn to lie better . See you tonight . Welcome to paradise . Welcome to Fhloston Paradise . It 's Ruby Rhod , and I 'll tell you live at 5 the winner of the super-green Gemini Croquette Contest ! The winner will go with me for two days to Fhloston Paradise . So tune in to Radio Cosmos . Don 't watch all day . It 'll rot your brain . For a perfect world . - Give me the cash . - Been here long ? Long enough . Come on , give me the cash . Is that a Z-140 ? Alleviated titanium . Neurocharged assault model . Good thing for me it 's not loaded . - What do you mean , it 's not loaded ? - You have to push that little yellow button to load it . Take your time . Want me to- - ? There you go . Give me the cash ! That 's a very dangerous gun . Maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you . You don 't mind , do you ? You sure ? No . Take it . I don 't need it . That 's a very nice hat . You like it ? God ! Please enter your license . Yes , just a minute . Welcome on board , Mr. Dallas . Good morning . Sleep well ? Me too . - I had a horrible nightmare . - Propulsion 2-X-4 . You have five points left on your license . Yeah , thank you for reminding me . Have a nice day . Why not ? You have 48 hours . That 's the time it needs to adapt to our living conditions . - And then ? - Then it will be too late . The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power but to exterminate life . All forms of life . So you 're telling me there 's nothing that can stop this . There is only one thing . The Mondoshawan have in their possession the weapon to defeat evil . Four elements gathered around a fifth supreme being , the ultimate warrior , created to protect life . Together they produce the Light of Creation . Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe . But if evil stands there ... . Then what ? Then light turns to dark . Life to death forever . A Mondoshawan spaceship requests permission to enter our territory . Give it permission to enter with our warmest regards . Thank you . Permission to enter granted . Showtime . We are lost . Aknot , we are connected to Earth . Mr. Zorg 's office . It 's Aknot . I 'm so glad to hear you , Aknot . The mission is accomplished . You 'll have what you asked for in a few hours . Good . I 'll meet you at my factory . The attack was by two unregistered warships . Close all borders and declare a state of general alert . Try to contact the Mondoshawans . We owe them an explanation . Three hundred years of waiting , for nothing . Go get some rest . No . The Mondoshawan ... . I am their contact on Earth . They will come for me . This is government business . I 'll keep you informed . The rescue team has reported from the crash site . Any survivors ? Only one . You call that a survivor ? A few cells still alive . More than I need . - Have you identified it ? - The computer went off the charts . Normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups which is enough for any species to perpetuate . This has 200,000 memo groups . - Sounds like a freak of nature . - Yeah , can 't wait to meet him . You okay ? Over here . Excuse me . General , I want to show you something . This is a normal human DNA chain . You , me , anybody , right ? Watch this . The compositional elements of his DNA chain are like ours . There 's simply more of them , with infinite genetic knowledge . Almost like this being was engineered . Is there any danger ? We put it through the cellular hygiene detector . The cell is , for lack of a better word perfect . Okay , go ahead . Mr. Perfect better be polite . Otherwise , I turn him into cat food . Activate it . Tissue processing . Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection . This is the last phase . The cells are bombarded by atoms which forces the body to react . That means growing skin . Wonderful . Reconstruction complete . Remove the shield . I told you . Perfect . Thermal bandages . I 'd like to take a few pictures for the archives . - What 's she saying ? - Activate the phonic detector . Is that thing solid ? - Unbreakable . - Good . If you want out you 'll have to develop those communication skills . General alert . Perfect . Ladder on 18 . Two men with me . The rest in the main ventilation . This way . Lady , stay calm . This is the police . There 's nowhere else to go . Slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor . Do you understand me ? She doesn 't . I think we need a flying unit . This is the police . This is the police . We are processing your identification . Put your arms up and follow our instructions . She has no file . She dove off . You just had an accident . Yes , I know I just had an accident , you daffy bastard ! You have one point left on your license . Look out ! Left ! I can 't believe it . Shit . Any survivors ? Hi . Are you okay ? Boom . Boom . Yeah , I understand " boom . " Bada boom . Big . Big bada boom . Big bada big boom . Big boom . - Yeah , big bada boom . - Bada boom . Big boom . Big bada boom . You 're lucky you 're not dead . This is a police control . Please keep your hands on the wheel . You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle . We are going to arrest her . Thank you for your cooperation . Sorry , honey . Looks like this is your ride . Open the door . Do what they say . Sorry . " Please help . " I only got one point left on my license . I need that to get back to the garage and get a six-month overhaul . You understand ? Can you please open the passenger door ? Please help . I can 't . I repeat please open the passenger door . Yeah , yeah , sure . Why not ? Thank you for your cooperation . Help . Finger 's gonna kill me . Emergency ! Emergency ! One point has been removed . Yes , I know ! This is so stupid . Assist in pursuit of yellow cab . Unit 47 , we 're on the way as soon as we finish lunch . Two golden menus . I 'm too old , too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod . Thank you so much . And I 'm definitely too thirsty . Look out ! We got lucky . If they don 't chase you after a mile , they don 't chase you . Maybe it 's two miles . Hang on . Look , lady , I only speak English and bad English ! Run an id . I 'm all for conversation , but maybe you can just shut up for a minute ! - He 's got a scan blocker . - Means he 's a car thief . Blast him . I don 't know what you did but they are really pissed off ! Hold on ! We 're safe for a while . You want to play soft ? I 'll play soft . You want to play hard ? Let 's play hard . If I get to the fog , we 'll be all right . If we make the fog . How do they expect us to find anything in this shit ? We 're just going to wait here until things quiet down , if you don 't mind . Shit . You okay ? Priest . You don 't need a priest , just a doctor . - Vito Cornelius . - What ? Priest . Yes ? I 'm looking for a priest . The weddings are one floor down . Congratulations . She 's not my bride . She 's my fare . She 's looking for Vito Cornelius . The phone book said he lived here . Yes , that 's me , but I don 't know who she is . Nobody does . No file , no id , nothing . She 's got a tattoo on this arm . Tattoo ? Fifth element . Finger 's gonna kill me . - Hey ! Wake up ! - Who are you ? I brought the girl , remember ? The redhead . She just dropped in on me . Started speaking this bizarre language . It 's not bizarre . It 's the divine language . The ancient language spoken throughout the universe before time was time . - He 's a she . - You noticed that . Yes . - It 's a miracle . - Miracle she 's not dead . Not a moment to lose . Wake her up . But gently , because this woman is mankind 's most precious possession . She is perfect . Perfect . More dignified . Hey , lady wake up . You 're right , I shouldn 't have done that . I was wrong to kiss you . He said to wake you gently . You 're right . Just thought you might remember me from the cab . Remember ? " Bada boom " ? " Big bada boom " ? Boom . Big bada boom . In the cab . Look . I drive a cab . This is me . Korben Dallas . Korben . You understand ? Here . Take it , go ahead . You can call me when you learn English . Just kidding . What is your name ? You . Korben . Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat . Good . That whole thing 's your name ? Do you have a shorter name ? Short . Korben Dallas . Leeloo . Leeloo . Korben , Leeloo . Leeloo , Korben . - You 're sure she 's a supreme being ? - Absolutely sure . Old friends . Yeah , you 're right . - Ask her for my gun back . - What 's your name ? Korben Dallas . Thank you for your help . You 've been kind , but now the girl needs to rest . She 's been on a long trip . I know . I was there when she landed . Wait , wait , Father . She said something I didn 't understand . - What does " ekto gamat " mean ? - " Never without my permission . " That 's what I thought . I shouldn 't have kissed her . Oh , no . I 'm so sorry . I forgot your food . How about some nice Thai food ? Yeah , yeah , hold on . Buddy , I 'm waiting all day here . - Finger . - Where is the cab ? - Car 's running fine . Purrs like a kitten . - Fine . What " fine " ? I know you . " Fine " ain 't in your vocabulary . You can tell your old buddy Finger what happened . What ? You save the planet ? You dinged the fender again . That 's it , right ? I was on my way to see you , and a fare fell in my lap . One of these big fares you can 't resist . How big ? Five-nine blue eyes long legs , great skin . You know . Perfect . I see . And this perfect fare , she got a name ? Yeah . Leeloo . What 's she doing ? Learning our history , the last 5000 years that she missed . She 's been asleep for a while . I know she 's been through a lot , but we don 't have much time . You 're right . Chicken . Good . Chicken . I 'm really sorry to interrupt you but the case with the stones where is it ? Stolen ? Who in God 's name would do such a thing ? Excuse me , sir . The council is worried about the economy heating up . Is it possible to fire 500,000 ? I thought from a smaller company , like one of the cab companies . Fire one million . But 500,000 ... . One million . Fine , sir . Sorry to have disturbed you . It 's for the Supreme ... . Sorry . I didn 't know your size , and I found you this makeup box . You just put it like that . Yes , there was a man with a limp came here a month ago asking about the stones . Said he was an art dealer . What was his name ? I 'm so bad with names . - They really make her- - - Perfect , I know . What did she say ? She says she knows exactly where they are . My dear Aknot , how about those two planes you borrowed ? Aknot , is that you ? What an ugly face . It doesn 't suit you . Take it off . That 's better . Never be ashamed of who you are . You 're warriors . Be proud . So what if the federal government scattered you to the wind . What doesn 't kill you makes you stronger . Your time for revenge is at hand . The ZF-1 . It 's light . The handle 's adjustable for easy carrying . Breaks down into four parts , undetectable by X-ray . Discreet . A word on firepower : Titanium recharger , 3000-round clip with bursts of 3 to 300 . With the replay button , a Zorg invention , it 's even easier . One shot and replay sends every following shot to the same location . And to finish the job , all the Zorg oldies but goldies . Rocket launcher . Arrow launcher with exploding or poisonous gas heads . Very practical . Our famous net launcher . The always-efficient flamethrower . My favourite . And for the grand finale , the all-new ice-cube system . Four full crates delivered right on time . And what about you , my dear Aknot ? Did you bring me what I asked you for ? Yes . Magnificent . This- - This case is empty . - What do you mean , empty ? - Empty the opposite of full . This case is supposed to be full ! Anyone care to explain ? The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust . Who took another route . She 's supposed to contact this person in a hotel . And she 's looking for the address . Easy . Dot . It 's Planet Fhloston , in the Angel Constellation . - We 're saved . - I 'm screwed . You asked for a case . We brought you a case . A case with four stones in it ! Not one or two or three , but four ! Four stones ! But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case ? We are warriors , not merchants . But you can still count ! It 's easy . Look at my fingers . Four stones , four crates . Zero stones , zero crates ! Pack everything up ! We 're out of here ! We risked our lives . I believe a little compensation is in order . So you are merchants after all . Leave him one crate for the cause . I don 't like warriors . Too narrow-minded , no subtlety and worse , they fight for hopeless causes , honour . Honour 's killed millions of people . Hasn 't saved a single one . I 'll tell you what I do like : a killer . A dyed-in-the-wool killer , cold-blooded , clean and methodical . A real killer picking up the ZF-1 would 've asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun . Bring me the priest . I got everything we need to know about Fhloston Paradise and a blueprint of the hotel . Good work , my son . Now to find a way there . It won 't be easy . There 's a charity ball tomorrow . Flights are full , and the hotel will be guarded . But there must be a way . I 'll get it . Weddings ? Not really . - Mr . Zorg would like to talk to you . - Mister who ? Mr. Zorg . Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg . It 's nice to see you again , Father . I remember you now . The so-called art dealer . I 'm glad you got your memory back , because you 're gonna need it . Where are the stones ? I don 't know . Even if I did , I wouldn 't tell someone like you . Why ? - What 's wrong with me ? - I try to serve life . But you only seem to want to destroy it . Father you 're so wrong . Let me explain . Life , which you so nobly serve ... Now , take this empty glass . Peaceful , serene , boring . But if it is destroyed ... . Look at all these little things . So busy now . Notice how each one is useful . What a lovely ballet ensues , so full of form and colour . Now , think of all those people that created them . Technicians , engineers . People who can feed their children tonight so those children can grow up and have children of their own and so on and so forth . Thus adding to the great chain of life . Water . Fruit . You see , Father , by creating a little destruction ... A cherry . ... I 'm , in fact , encouraging life . In reality , you and I are in the same business . Cheers . Where 's the robot to pat you on the back ? Or the engineer ? Or their children , maybe ? There , you see how all your so-called power counts for nothing ? How your entire empire of destruction comes crashing down all because of one , little cherry . You saved my life and in return , I 'll spare yours for now . You 're a monster , Zorg . I know . Torture who you have to , the president , I don 't care . Just bring me those stones . You have one hour . It 's gobbling up all the satellites in the galaxy . Why in the hell is it eating up all the satellites ? We 're working on it , Mr. President . The Mondoshawan deplore the incident but accept our apologies . And the stones ? Did you find them ? - They weren 't on board . - What ? The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race . They gave them to someone they do trust . Her name is Plavalaguna . She 's a diva . She 's singing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise . She has the stones with her . The Mondoshawans will help . All we have to do is send someone to get the stones . Excellent . I want this operation to be discreet as possible . No troops . No big operation . I want your best man to go undercover . I have the perfect one . You got a message . Not gonna open it ? Could be important . Like the last two were important . First one was from my wife telling me she 's leaving . The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife . That is bad luck . But grandfather say : " lt never rain every day . " This is good news , guaranteed . I bet you lunch . Okay . Come on . " You are fired . " Oh , I 'm sorry . At least I won lunch . Good philosophy . See good in bad . I like . - Hello . - Korben , sweetheart . You got broken fingers ? You can 't punch my number ? - Hi , Mom . - Seventeen messages . Don 't say your machine is broken again . They last 1000 years . Mr. Kim , you should go . This 'll take a minute . You don 't feed your cat a croquette , who you love more than me . - She didn 't breast-feed you . I did . - Goodbye , Mr. Dallas . Good fortune for you . You don 't have a girl . I 'll never be a grandmother . - lt bring you good luck ! - Yeah , sure . What are you talking about ? No , all I want is an explanation . I just got in . I just smashed my cab . I lost my job . I got mugged . Besides that , everything 's peachy . Thanks for asking . Now , settle down and explain this to me . If I 'd won a trip , I 'd know . I would 've been notified . I 'll call you back . General , how nice to see you in the 5000 block . Nice apartment , major . You 've settled into a wonderful life . Heard you lost your job . You heard that ? Don 't worry . I 'll get another job . Don 't bother . We have one for you . " Major Dallas , you 've been selected for a mission . " - What mission ? - To save the world . " You leave for Fhloston Paradise . Get four stones from the diva Plavalaguna and bring them back . " - Any questions ? - Yeah , just one . Why me ? - I retired six months ago , remember ? - Three reasons . One , as a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit of the army you are an expert in the use of all necessary weapons and spacecraft . Two , you 're the most highly decorated member of your unit . - The third ? - Of all the members of your unit you 're the only one left alive . - Check your messages ? - I 've had enough good news . Might be important . You 're a winner ! You 've won the Gemini Contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two . Here are your tickets . You rigged the contest ? Congratulations . You couldn 't be more discreet ? Old tricks are the best tricks . Major lceborg will accompany you as your wife . I am not going . Why not ? Excuse me , general . Who is it ? Who is it ? - My wife . - You remarried ? Yes . No . I just met this girl , but I 'm gonna marry her . I love her , but she hates the military . She knows the military ruined my last marriage . She can 't have anything to do with it . If she sees you , she 'll kill me . - Major-- - You gotta hide somewhere . - You 've gotta help me . - We 'd love to , but where can we hide ? - We don 't have time for this . - It 's just for one minute . You have no idea how much you 're helping me . No idea- - You have no idea . - I 'm going to be happily married . - Major ! Major ! - The three of us won 't fit . - Sure you will . Major ! You 're on my foot . Major ! Major ! I 'm really sorry to resort to this , Mr. Wallace- - Dallas . We heard about your good luck and need your tickets for Fhloston . Is this the way priests vacation ? - Not vacation . We 're on a mission . - What kind ? We have to save the world , my son . - You 're gonna save the world ? - Yes ! Down there . Down there .

This is not an exercise . Can you please spread your legs and place your hands in the yellow circles . - What are you doing ? - Saving you so you can save the world . Yeah , but l- - I think this is the door . No name , no number . Let 's see it . Are you classified as human ? Negative . I am a meat Popsicle . I found him . Mr. Korben Dallas ? Sir , can you put your hands in the yellow circles , please ? Smoke you ! Wrong answer . The police control is now terminated . Thank you for your cooperation . Have a nice day . We got the guy . Wasn 't easy , but we bagged him . - Thanks for the tip . - Glad to be of help , my friend . The guy 's been arrested for uranium smuggling . All I have to do now is go to the airport , take his place and I 'll be in Fhloston in four hours . Don 't come back without the stones . Korben Dallas . We got him . Perfect . Akanit , take command . Go to Fhloston and get the stones . If Zorg really wants them he 'll have to negotiate . Revenge is at hand . Oh , I am so sorry . I forgot about the autowash .

Major Dallas , I first would like to salute a warrior . You 're a shining example of this army . In the name of the Federation- - Any idea when you 'll get to the point ? Okay . There 's a ball of fire 1 200 miles in diameter heading straight for Earth and we have no idea how to stop it . That 's the problem . How much time do we have ? If its speed remains constant , in an hour and 57 minutes . I 'll call you back in two hours . Hello ? They just landed in the desert . Good job , David . - Put her in the centre . - Where ? Here ? You got it figured out , Father ? This one should be fire . - You know how this works ? - Theoretically . The four stones should go around . The fifth element should be in the middle and then the weapon against evil should work . - You 've never seen this work ? - No . Every weapon has a manual . I 'm sure this has one too . - That 's it . That 's it . - Match up the symbols . Go ! Go ! Wind . My man , what you doing ? - What ? - What you doing ? Trying to keep you in the DJ business . Fire .

How do you open these stones ? Wind blows . Fire burns . Yes , I know all that . But how do you open these stones ? Rain falls . What does it mean ? I think that- - Maybe it 's a charade . A game or something . If we don 't get these stones open in five minutes , we 're dead . - Dead ? - Yes , dead . Too late . - We 've lost contact with them . - Three minutes . I think mine is broken . Why I gotta get the broke one ? We 're never gonna make it . Korben . Korben , it moved ! - Show me what you did . - Nothing . Shut up , shut up ! Calm down . Show me what you did , step by step . - I was just standing here . - Quickly . I put my hands on the top like this , and I said : " We 're not gonna make it . " And that 's it ? Korben , my man . Wind . She said , " Wind blows . " Everyone take a stone . Water for water . Fire for fire . Earth for Earth . Go ! Earth . Open the other one . Korben , my man , I have no fire . I have no matches . Do you have any ? I stopped smoking . Father , you smoke ? Got some matches ? We need some fire . We gonna die . Don 't breathe . Fire . One minute . Let 's go , Leeloo . Wake up . Wake up . It 's time for you to work now . Protect life until death . Listen to me ! Listen to me . Listen , I know you 're very tired . I 'll take you on vacation . A real vacation , just you and me . But if you don 't do something right now , we 'll all die . What 's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it ? It 'll be entering the atmosphere in 40 seconds . Leeloo , you 're right . You 're right . But there are some things very nice things worth saving , beautiful things . Beautiful things . Like love ? Yes , love . That 's good . That 's good . That 's a good example . Love is worth saving . I don 't know love . I don 't know love . I was built to protect , not to love . So there 's no use for me other than this . You 're wrong . You 're wrong . You 're wrong . I need you . I need you , very much . Why ? Because ... . Because ... . Tell her , Korben . Tell me . Please . Why do you need me ? - Because ... . - Tell me . - Tell me . - Because l- - Because I love you . I love you . Ten , nine , eight , seven six , five , four , three two , one ... . Scanner imaging has confirmed the dark planet dead . The planet seems to have stopped at 62 miles from impact . What 's wrong with you ? What you screaming for ? Every five minutes , it 's a bomb or something . I 'm leaving . Mr. President . Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh who runs the centre . It 's an honour , Mr. President . Where are my two heroes ? They were so tired from their ordeal , we put them in the reactor . I have 19 meetings after this . Let me see if they 're revived . Thank you . We go live in one minute , Mr. President . They 're not ready . They need ... - ... five more minutes . - You have 20 seconds . - No , ma 'am , I tried . No , ma 'am . - Who 's that ? Some woman . Claims to be Korben 's mother . Give it here . Mrs. Dallas , this is the president . On behalf of the Federation- - That doesn 't even sound like him . The president 's an idiot . You don 't sound like an idiot . If you don 't want to talk to your mother , just avoid me as usual . I 'll throw myself in traffic . I 'll Saran Wrap myself to the bed .

MY MOTHER WROTE THE WORD " PALM . " THAT 'S WHAT THE MAN WHO HEALED THE VICTIMS USED- - THE PALM OF HIS HAND . Y-YOU THINK IT 'S A LEAP ? MULDER , THERE 'S NO DEEP MYSTERY HERE . YOUR MOTHER IS AT THE RIGHT AGE ... FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN . YEAH , BUT WHY THE WORD " PALM " ? WELL , THERE COULD BE SEVERAL REASONS . BUT TO BE HONEST , I DON 'T THINK IT MEANS ANYTHING . HER BRAIN AND HER THOUGHT PROCESSES ... HAVE BEEN- - HAVE BEEN RADICALLY CHANGED BY WHAT 'S HAPPENED . IT COULD VERY WELL HAVE AFFECTED HER CENTER OF SPEECH , HER LANGUAGE . BUT YOU CAN 'T EXPLAIN IT EXACTLY . NOR CAN IT BE EXPLAINED HOW THE WOUNDED WERE MIRACULOUSLY HEALED ... OR HOW THE MAN WHO HEALED THEM VANISHED INTO THIN AIR . I 'M SURE IT CAN AND WILL BE . MULDER , I 'M GONNA DRIVE YOU TO THE NEAREST MOTEL . IT 'S BEEN A VERY LONG DAY . I WANNA GO BACK TO D.C. - TO DO WHAT ? - I WANNA FIND OUT WHO THIS MIRACLE MAN IS . THIS IS EVERYTHING SHOT BY THE FIRST NEWS CREW ON THE SCENE . OUTTAKES AND UNEDITED FOOTAGE .

YOU SEEM SURPRISED . SURELY YOU WERE AWARE THEY KNEW EACH OTHER . OR WHAT BROUGHT THEM HERE TOGETHER . I DON 'T KNOW . DID HE HURT HER ? NO . NO , SHE COLLAPSED AFTER HE LEFT . I DARE SAY , IF I HADN 'T BEEN HERE TO MAKE THE CALL , SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE SURVIVED . WHAT DID THEY ARGUE ABOUT ? I DON 'T KNOW . I WAS FORCED TO KEEP A DISCREET DISTANCE . YOU MUST 'VE HAD SOME IDEA , OR ELSE YOU WOULDN 'T HAVE FOLLOWED THEM HERE . HE WANTS SOMETHING FROM HER , SOMETHING SHE MAY HAVE KEPT IN THIS HOUSE . UNLESS YOU KNOW ANOTHER REASON THEY WOULD 'VE CHOSEN TO MEET HERE . THE DAY MY PARENTS DIVORCED , MY MOTHER VOWED NEVER TO SET FOOT IN THIS SUMMER HOUSE AGAIN . I KNOW MY MOTHER . SHE KEPT HER WORD . IT COULD BE SOMETHING VERY OLD . CERTAINLY SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT . I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT COULD BE . NO IDEA AT ALL ? NO . SIR ? EXCUSE ME . I- - YES ? ARE YOU JEREMIAH SMITH ? YES .

YOU GAVE ME A WRONG ADDRESS , SIR . THEN YOU LEFT THE CRIME SCENE DURING THE INTERVIEW . I DON 'T REMEMBER THAT . I 'M SORRY . WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER , MR. SMITH ? I REMEMBER SHOWING UP FOR WORK THE NEXT DAY , BEING AT MY DESK . THAT 'S MY FIRST RECOLLECTION . AT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ? I 'M NOT SURE WHAT I 'VE DONE WRONG . YOU HAVEN 'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG , SIR . MAY I GO ? YES . BUT UNTIL THIS MATTER IS RESOLVED COMPLETELY , I 'D ASK THAT YOU NOTIFY US IF YOU 'LL BE OUT OF TOWN FOR ANY REASON . [ Sighs ] AGENT SCULLY ? THIS BECOMES A RESPONSIBILITY , A THING THAT I 'M NOW CALLED UPON TO PUT RIGHT AND PUT DOWN . CERTAINLY YOU EXPECTED NOTHING LESS . I 'M NOT ASHAMED OF MY ACTIONS . " ASHAMED " ? YOU 'RE NOT ALLOWED THE LUXURY OF HUMAN WEAKNESS AND PENITENCE . YOU 'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PUT YOUR INDULGENCES AHEAD OF THE GREATER PURPOSE . I NO LONGER BELIEVE IN " THE GREATER PURPOSE . " THEN YOUR FATE IS JUST . MY JUSTICE IS NOT FOR YOU TO METE OUT . YOU MAY HAVE REASON . YOU HAVE NO RIGHT . YOU HAVE NO MEANS EITHER . YOU PRESUME TO DICTATE DUTY TO ME ? HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT THE COST OF YOUR ACTIONS IS ? WHAT THEIR AFFECT MIGHT BE ? WHO ARE YOU TO GIVE THEM HOPE ? WHAT DO YOU GIVE THEM ? WE GIVE THEM HAPPINESS , AND THEY GIVE US AUTHORITY . THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE AWAY THEIR FREEDOM UNDER THE GUISE OF DEMOCRACY . MEN CAN NEVER BE FREE ... BECAUSE THEY 'RE WEAK , CORRUPT , WORTHLESS ... AND RESTLESS . THE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN AUTHORITY . THEY 'VE GROWN TIRED OF WAITING FOR MIRACLE AND MYSTERY . SCIENCE IS THEIR RELIGION . NO GREATER EXPLANATION EXISTS FOR THEM . THEY MUST NEVER BELIEVE ANY DIFFERENTLY ... IF THE PROJECT IS TO GO FORWARD . AT WHAT COST TO THEM ? THE QUESTION 'S IRRELEVANT , AND THE OUTCOME INEVITABLE . THE DATE IS SET . AT WHAT COST TO THEM FOR YOUR OWN SELFISH BENEFIT ? HOW MANY MUST DIE AT YOUR HAND ... TO PRESERVE YOUR STAKE IN THE PROJECT ? [ Knocks On Door ] I 'M NOT IMPRESSED BY YOUR MIRACLES OR MOVED BY YOUR TRICKERY . YOUR JUSTICE WILL BE METED OUT . BY WHOM THIS TIME ? AND BY WHAT TOOL ?

HE 'S THE REASON FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO HER . - WHERE DID YOU GET THESE ? - IT DOESN 'T MATTER WHERE I GOT THOSE . THE THING THAT MATTERS IS THAT THAT MAN IS CALLED TO ANSWER . NOW I WANT HIS NAME ! I DON 'T KNOW HIS NAME ! YOU KNOW HOW TO GET IT ! THESE MEN DON 'T HAVE NAMES ! THEN YOU TELL ME HOW TO FIND HIM ! THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL YOU HOW TO CONTACT HIM , BUT THAT TIME HAS PASSED . HE KNOWS ABOUT THE MAN THAT DISAPPEARED FROM THE RESTAURANT SHOOTING . WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? HE 'S TRYING TO KILL HIM . HE JUST CAME IN YESTERDAY . HE TURNED HIMSELF IN . WHAT ? HE- - HE GAVE A STATEMENT . WHERE IS HE NOW ?

WHAT YOU 'RE AFRAID OF IS , THEY 'LLBELIEVE I AM GOD . IT DOESN 'T MATTER . MOST OF THEM HAVE CEASED TO BELIEVE IN GOD . WHY ? BECAUSE GOD PRESENTS THEM WITH NO MIRACLES TO EARN THEIR FAITH . YOU THINK WHEN MAN CEASES TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES , HE REJECTS GOD ? - OF COURSE . - YOU RULE OVER THEM IN GOD 'S NAME . THEY DON 'T BELIEVE IN HIM , BUT THEY STILL FEAR HIM . THEY 'RE AFRAID NOT TO , BECAUSE THEY 'RE AFRAID OF FREEDOM . AND YOU GIVE THEM HAPPINESS . WE APPEASE THEIR CONSCIENCE . ANYONE WHO CAN APPEASE A MAN 'S CONSCIENCE CAN TAKE HIS FREEDOM AWAY FROM HIM . AND IF YOU CAN 'T APPEASE THEIR CONSCIENCE , YOU KILL THEM . BUT YOU CAN 'T KILL THEM ALL . YOU CAN 'T KILL THEIR LOVE , WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THEM WHO THEY ARE , MAKES THEM BETTER THAN US , BETTER THAN YOU . YOU TALK . I 'M NOT ONE OF YOU . NO . ALL YOU WANT IS TO BE A PART OF IT , TO BE ONE OF THE COMMANDANTS WHEN THE PROCESS BEGINS . BUT YOU ARE WRONG . OH , AM I ? YES . YOU ARE DYING OF LUNG CANCER . THAT 'S A LIE . YOU THINK IT 'S A LIE ? YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR LIFE . AND YOU ? WE HAD BEEN HOPEFUL , BUT THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL BLOOD LOSS DURING THE STROKE EVENT ...

 [ overdubbed in Chinese ] : [ yelling ] [ yelling and whimpering ] [ overdubbed in Spanish ] [ overdubbed in Chinese ] Lisa , this is just ... it 's just great . - It is , isn 't it ? - It shouldn 't end . Who says it has to ? This is probably going to sound bizarre but I could really see you and me ... you know ... together . Really ? You mean it ? I 'll tell you , Lis , I would make you the happiest woman in the world . I would worship you and I 'd never let go of you . You 're all I think about . You 're all I could ever ask for in a , um ... - woman . - Yeah , right . Lisa ? Come on , you can 't leave me here . How am I going to get home ? So you just left him in China ? He deserve it . five seconds after we were kissing he was checking out this geisha girl . - You kissed him ? - Yes , I kissed him . - On the mouth ? - Yes . Bad Lisa ! Fooling around with Chett is bad ! He is the most immature person I know . [ growling ] I am Walrus Man ! - I stand by my statement . - Ow ... Tater burn . One must transcend pain to hear the laughter of the soul . - Chett ? - Call me Kwai-Chang Chett . How did you get home ? Ah , Gentle Lisa . After you deserted me I wandered the back roads of China lost ... alone . As I neared death I was taken in by an order of Shao-lin priests who taught me the ancient ways . - Kabobs ? - Uh , no . So you see , Lisa ... I am reborn . Mature , wise ... centered ... and ready to make an honest commitment to the woman I ... love . Here you go . I 'm sorry . What was I saying ? You were saying good-bye . He 'll never learn . He 's genetically incapable of commitment . Hello ? We 've been trying to tell you . You have to make him realize it . Use magic to make Chett realize he 's not ready to settle down . - Otherwise , he won 't stop bugging you . - It won 't take much . Just zap up some tiny relationship problem and watch him run away screaming . That 's a great idea . - Chett , I 'm carrying your baby . - What ? That 's a tiny relationship problem ? I was thinking more like , uh , leaving the top off the toothpaste . Yeah , right . Quit yanking me . Come , you dog ! Now you die ! Does this look like I 'm yanking you ? What 'd you do ? Swallow a coleman lantern ? That 's what genie tummies look like when we 're ... with child . Look , you 're not pregnant . You can 't be . All we did was kiss . People don 't get pregnant from a kiss . But genies can . You see , it was three weeks after the beaver moon which is a highly charged time . It just takes a tiny jolt of electricity to make a genie pregnant . Oh . So I guess you 're sorry you ever got involved with me . S-sorry ? We 'll be together , Lis . - Huh ? - Huh ? I 'll be a dad . This is great . - You mean ... you 're not upset ? - No way . This is the best thing that ever happened to me . Whoa . Did not see that coming . Chett , think about what you 're saying . You are staring down a double-barreled showgun- - parenthood and monogamy . So I have to give up being a jobless loser who collects guns and lives with his folks to spend the rest of my life with a beautiful magic genie . Oh , poor me . - You mean you would 've stuck by me ? - Would 've ? Um , I have a confession to make . I 'm not really pregnant . - But you got that cute little gut light . - It 's fake . Watch , I 'll make it go away . - Uh-oh . - What 's wrong ? Why is it still glowing ? I must 've put too much oomph in my zap . I accidentally made myself pregnant . For real . I always dreamt of having a baby but I never wanted to make it all by myself . Yeah . Zapping yourself pregnant pretty much skips the golden part . - Can I touch ? - Keep your meat-hooks off my kid . Weren 't you listening ? You 're not the dad . Well , I am now . Lucky for Lisa , she 's got a real man standing by- - a proud marine who 's ready to fall on this baby grenade . You mean you 're sticking with me ? Even though it 's not yours ? You betcha . What do you think about " Clint Donnelly " ? Or if it 's a girl , " Brick " . We could call her " Little Brickie . " Wow . I was really wrong about you . I 'm sorry . But there 's no way in Hell we 're calling my baby " Brickie . " - Now , " Cletus " there 's a name . - Or if it 's my boy , " Shemp . " Deal . Maybe having a baby will by fun . Fun ? Am I the only one her who is concerned about bringing a living , breathing creature into this all-too-harsh world when none of us know - what the hell we 're doing ? - It 's kicked . It 's kicked ! Ooh , ooh , ooh ! Let me feel . Fully automatic . Nice action . Recoil 's not bad . Let 's put it in the cart . I 'm heading over to baby bottles . Right behind you . I want in on the nipple test . Rebel leader , alpha dog ! incoming . Roof ! Roof ! Roof ! [ imitating explosion ] And Donnelly eats a grenade to save the battalion . Rocko ! My man ! - What are you doing here in baby town ? - Are you kidding ? Got to shock up . New recruit on the way . - The missus is a real Fertile Myrtle . - You remember my little girl- - Patton . Oh , she 's so adorable . Come here and give your Uncle Chett a big hug . Hug this . - [ groaning ] - [ Patton giggling ] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ! Direct hit ! Hmm . After you take a few shots in the old tropic of capricorn chester , - the cup becomes standard gear . - [ groaning ] Why don 't you give Uncle Chett a good hug ? [ retching ] That she blows . Relax , Chester . Kids do that . Your kid will do that . All part of being a dad . All part of being a dad . All part of being a dad . Hey , hey , hey . There he is now . There 's the dad . - The big , proud papa . - Hoo-willie That 's me . Where you going ? Oh , uh ... just taking my luggage out to be cleaned . - He 's not coming back . - Hey , guys , is it normal for a pregnant lady to get cravings for potpourri ? It makes my breath smell like christmas . [ engine revving ] Hey , where 's my man going ? - Lis , you still got us . - I want Chett . - We 'll be the best dads in history . - Lots of expensive toys . Nothing buys a kid 's affection like a good expensive toy . And love . We 'll do love , too . I want Chett . [ sighing ] You have got the life , Mr. Pigoen . Your lady lays an egg and you just fly away , free as a ... - [ cooing ] - Well , as a pigeon . Trouble , Chester ? - Assistant Principal Scampi . - That 's " Principal Scampi " now . Just when I thought my day couldn 't bite any more . We 're in the park , old foe- - neutral ground . I find the great outdoors to be a panacea for troubled souls . My girl is pregnant ... by her own hand . [ sighs ] Chester , Chester , Chester . When will you learn to simply take responsibility for your actions ? You don 't understand . I 'm not ready to be a dad . One rarely is . You 'll grow into it but don 't squander this precious gift you 've been given . - Come on . - I always wanted to have children of my own but I have a condition dating back to my disco days- - studio 54 , Donna Summer a gilded dance cage and extremely tight jordache jeans ... but I don 't need to paint you a picture . - Ouch . - Ouch , indeed . But I 've channeled my paternal urges into matters principalian , helping young people reach their full potential . You give . They give back to you tenfold . Oh . SCAMPI : Tenfold . [ martial artists yelling ] Hey , kids . Daddy 's a little dry . Thanks . [ sniffs ] Uh-oh . Uh-oh . Somebody needs changing . Much better . Thanks , kids . Maybe you 're right . Maybe I 'm right ? This is quite a moment- - The day I got through to Chester Donnelly . I 'm ... proud of you ... - son . - Move it or lose it . Breathe . Breathe . Bite me . Bite me . Oh ! Lisa , your man is back- - tanned , rested and commitment-ready . Move , loser . We 're having a baby . - Lost your chance Kaw-Chang . - Now ? Baby now ? Yes . Oh ! Lisa , I 'm so sorry I punked out on you but don 't worry . I 'm here now . I wish I could take the pain away - and go through this for you . - Oh , you 're such a doll . Here you go . [ yelling ] Is that a load off . What have you done ? - You 're pregnant . - There goes your boyish figure . [ groaning ] Drugs . I want drugs . You 're doing great , for a guy . Of course , the pain gets a little sharper when the contractions come . You mean , I haven 't had ... ? [ screaming ] Hello ! We got an emergency here . Hey . Hi . We need a doctor . - My brother 's having a baby ! - Hmm ? [ grunting ] [ yelling ] - What was that ? ! - It 's the contractions . - It 's making the baby zap-happy . - [ yells ] : Get me a doctor ! I think I 'm dilating . We 're running out of time . Grab a doctor and I 'll find an empty room . [ screaming ] Wait ! How are we going to find him ? - [ screaming ] - Never mind . - [ gasping ] - Try not to focus on the pain . There is no pain . No pain . [ rumbling ] The pain is tremendous ! Uh ! This is stupid . When we find a doctor what are we supposed to say ? We 've got a pregnant guy in room 104 who 's going to drop a pup ? That 's why we need to find the perfect doctor . Someone resourceful , crafty billiant , yet demented . A renegade bastard . Ah . [ chuckles ] Mmm . [ sighs ] We have a winner . Now , don 't you be getting too comfy there , fella . I paid perfectly good , US legal tender for this private boudoir . Don 't you yell at him . I 'm responsible for this . I 'm sorry , Chett . I didn 't believe you were ready for commitment . But as you lie here squirming in agony I 'm reminded with every anguished grunt and tortured scream that you 've matured into a real man . The kind of man I can have an honest relationship with . Why don 't you crawl under the sheets and whisper that in my ear ? - You are incredible . - You are two twisted little horny toads . I 'm calling security . You 're having Lucifer 's baby ! So , what exactly are his symptons , hmm ? Uh ... distended belly . Violent mood swings . - Uh , tender nipples . - Excuse me ? Well , he is lactating . [ snorts ] : Sounds like your brother 's pregnant . Your words . - [ Chett panting ] - [ gasping ] That 's fantastic . How do you feel , son ? Like I swallow a pack of rabid wolverines and one raw pork chop . Oh , I bet you do . You 're lucky you came to see me . I 'm probably the only doctor in the world with the courage to embrace the impossible . Other doctors would look at that distended bag of flesh - and see a freak of nature . - [ sighs ] I see a man heavy with child crying out for the tender ministrations that only these ... healing hands can provide . Looks like the baby 's inherited Lisa 's magic - and Chett 's poor sense of timing . - What do we do ? I think we should ... ow ! Fire in the hole ! Look . The baby ! That 's a baby ! Pure genie energy . A star child . [ cooing ] You did good . I 'm proud of you . Look at him ... her ... it . - Our baby . - He 's not just our baby ; he belongs to the universe . Watch . [ crashing ] [ thunderous roaring ] [ " Also Spracht Zarathustra " playing ] Cootchie-cootchie-coo . Who 's got the cute little tum-tum ? Come on , come on , big burp for Uncle Wy-Wy . Cletus and Fetus is an omnipotent star-being - with god-like cosmic awareness . - I think she finds it reassuring . - [ telepathically ] : dweebs . - Idiot . - I 'm rubbering , and you 're glue , pal . - Knock it off , you two punks or I will blast you into sub-atomic particles . - I think somebody needs a nap . - Looking for a timeout , Cletus ?

 Raging Bender Good news , everyone ! I 've taught the toaster to feel love . Hermes returns from his vacation today . - Good morning . - Hey , Hermes ! - Yo ! - My man ! - So how was it ? - Stopover on the Brain Slug planet . Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay . Hermes has all the fun . He 's got a Brain Slug on his head ! - You 're gonna get us assimilated . - Switch to a garlic shampoo . Today 's mission is to go to the Brain Slug planet . - What 'll we do ? - Walk around not wearing a helmet . Sounds great , Hermes ! Whatever you say . - Let 's ditch him and go to the movies . - Hey , yeah ! Good idea . I 'm seeing a movie with friends . Cool , let 's see this one . No . I 'm not in the mood for a documentary . I 've heard good things about Quizblorg , Quizblorg . I hate subtitles . Alien films are so pretentious . Fellows ! How about a film we can all enjoy ? Planet of the Clams . About an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam . Who invited you ? Let 's see All My Circuits . I wanna see that . Good point , Bender ! - A small slurm . - For 25 cents less , get a super small . Okay . Oh , man ! Give me a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil . Down in front ! Glagnar 's Human Rinds presents : This Week in the Universe . - This is real futuristic . - Don 't talk during the movie . New New York mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer opens a new tube line to alleviate rush-hour traffic . Dateline , Paramecium Homeworld . Miss Universe Gladys Lennox entertains troops fighting to wipe out the human race . Go get ' em , boys ! In Ultimate Robot Fighting , The Masked Unit wins against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting . Go , Masked Unit ! Hey , buddy ? Yo ! - Mind taking your head off ? - I need it to watch the movie . Ask Flabby here to describe it to you later . She is as the factory made her . They should have stopped about halfway through . Well , that finishes this paperwork . Calculon Enterprises . A fight scene has broken out at the warehouse ! Come quickly , before an explosion chases someone down a hallway . I have no choice but to ... If you want Calculon to race to the battle in his Hover Ferrari , press 1 . If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork , press 2 . - You have pressed 2 . - I didn 't ! I 'm almost positive you did . Add in the carryover from form 16-A , then deduct line 2-B . Pardon me , sir . But you seem to be kicking my seat . " Pardon me , sir . But you seem to be ... " That 's the gist of what I said . Would you mind ? Sure thing , pal . Sir ? - Who threw that ? - That 's it ! Sir , I challenge you to fisticuffs . Oh , I 'm boned . Let 's all go to the lobby ! I 'm gonna open a pile of whup-ass on you ! Do you know who that was ? Cripes ! The Masked Unit ! You knocked him out cold ! Wow , I 'm impressed ! I 'm the commissioner of Robot Fighting . A connoisseur of jerks who pick fights . And you 're the biggest . - You should see me at funerals . - I want you in the League . Ultimate Robot Fighting ? Sounds pleasant . I 'll do it . My hero ! They don 't make movies like this anymore . I 'm gonna be the greatest robot fighter ever ! Float like a float-bot , sting like a stinging machine ! You can 't be a robot fighter . It 's the most brutal form of competition . - It is ? - There are no rules . Two robots enter , one robot leaves . The other leaves after being declared the winner . - That doesn 't sound so bad . - Did I mention the crippling pain ? I 'm pretty sure I did . Yes , definitely . Crippling ? That 's not covered by my insurance . Count me out . You 've got to do it . I don 't care how suicidal it is . How come when I want to have fun you 're against it ? This is more important than that marble-eating contest . - Let me tell you a story . - Oh , again with the orphanarium . When I was growing up , I got picked on a lot . My only outlet was Octouran Kung Fu . Excellent . Bill , Keith , you will go to championships . Bill , congratulate Keith when he wakes up . But I can beat these dorks with one eye closed . Perhaps . There is more to winning than that . - You lack the will of a warrior . - What do you mean ? Watch this . No girl has the will of a warrior . You have the will of a housewife . - At best , the schoolmarm . - I 'll take you on right now . But I have the will of the warrior . Therefore , the battle is over . The winner ? Me ! Rematch ? You lose again ! Had enough ? I thought so ! I lost my chance . I won 't let you throw away yours . She 's right . I don 't want to end up like her ! Count me back in ! Let 's see what you got . Touch your toes . Still can 't reach ! Let 's commence preparations for rumbling ! Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars ! Welcome to tonight 's main event . From Mom 's Friendly Robot Factory in America 's heartland , Mexico : Bender ! And in this corner , from and made of parts unknown : The Clear Cutter ! - Bender rules ! - I got you a Bender hat . Wow ! Thanks , Hermes ! I ... Hey , cut that out ! You can 't hit what you can 't see . Get up . You can 't quit every time you get an ax in the back . Or a drill through your face . Quit scratching your ax-hole and get back . And the winner is ... Bender ! - Nice work out there , kid . - He might be dead . I took a life ! Hi , boss . Yo , dude . He 's not dead ! What 's up ? You didn 't read the pamphlet ? Ultimate Robot Fighting is a scam . Keep it under your head . But the most popular robot always wins . I 'm not a great fighter ? I won because I 'm popular ? - Bingo . - Whoo-hoo , I 'm popular ! You 're pure lowest common denominator . Go Bender ! Go Bender ! Go Bender ! Presenting Bender The Offender ! I 'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back . Versus Billionaire Bot ! Versus The Foreigner ! I 'm not from here ! I have my own customs ! Look at my crazy passport ! Versus The Chain Smoker ! I love smoking . And after I win the fight I 'm headed straight to your favorite restaurant . You know , I 'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover . You 're three hours late . You can 't give up . Both of us worked so hard . - " We " ? - I said " us . " Bender The Offender doesn 't need you ! He doesn 't need anybody . - What about us , Mr. The Offender ? - Well , I need floozies . Let 's roll . Howdy , chief . What do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud ? We 're going in a different direction . We wouldn 't be fighting in the conventional sense . You 're slipping . Sales of Bender Brand bath soaps are down 20 percent . Those morons ! I said peaberry , not sandalwood ! If you can 't move sandalwood , you don 't belong here ! - You 'll lose next week 's title match . - But the crowd loves me . Let 's see how they feel about your new persona . - The Gender Bender ! - The most unpopular fighter since Sergeant Feces Processor . Oh , yeah ? What if I don 't let the new guy win ? Then he 'll just beat you the old-fashioned way : To death ! Melissa , send in the new kid . I am Destructor . See you at the fight . I said , " See you at the fight . " And that 's the story . I thought it was real , like pro wrestling . But it 's fixed , like boxing . It 's one thing to win a fixed fight . There 's dignity . But to lose ? And in this atrocity ? I can 't do it . You 've gotta train me to win . No ! You wouldn 't take my help when you didn 't need it so why now ? - What are you talking about ? - I don 't know . But I 'm not helping . You loved him as Bender The Offender ! Get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona : The Gender Bender ! I 'm a real toughie . Squaring off this Sunday versus Destructor ! I will destroy you ! And stop calling me . I am his trainer , Master Funog . He will be victorious for he has the will of a warrior . Not Funog ! Let 's hit the gym . I 'll teach you to fight like a girl ! I 'll put on my tutu . Hello , and welcome to a remarkable championship bout . Destructor , a robotic armored tank whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime versus Gender Bender , who wears a pink tutu . This is Rich Little imitating Howard Cosell , here at ringside with George Foreman . George , a word in edgewise ? This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall Joe Frazier . My memory is not so good , but I think the Earth was destroyed . Interesting , if true . The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0 . A bet of $ 0 on Bender pays $ 1000 if he wins . Still , very few takers . It 's not a smart bet . You 're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand . Instead , prance out and kick his head off . Got it . Large kickie , hold the tickle . - Thank God I 'm free of that nightmare ! - Sorry . Here you go . Thanks . It was cold on the floor . - Professor , I got you a program . - Good . Just let me put on my reading glasses . Why , Zoidberg ! There 's a lovely photo of you in here ! In this corner , the confused young robot with the golden curls weighing 525 pounds The Gender Bender ! Get that hippie out ! And in these two corners weighing 400 tons the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach ! Destructor ! We meet again . Girl who acts like fighter , training fighter who acts like girl . - Keep laughing , Funog . - Ready ? - I was built ready . Give me the bell . Did you hear a noise ? Final boarding call for Flight 406 non-stop service to pain . Now boarding standby passengers ... It 's a good time to bring up my new grill . With its patented design , the fat drains directly into my mouth . Fry ! Throw in the towel ! For God 's sakes , Fry . That 's exactly what I was thinking . - Mommy ! - Funog , that 's enough . Call him off . Funog ? Why won 't anyone help me ? So once more we meet again . You 're just controlling him like a puppet . I mean , cheating in a fake fight . That 's low . Better than being a girl . Like you . You 're a girl ! Oh , right . Girls lack the will of the warrior . It 's Bendering time ! Take this ! And this ! You were an excellent student . Too bad I was a lousy teacher . I think you misunderstood the concept of Bendering time . See you in girl hell ! I 'll be in boy hell , much nicer . Yes ! Yes ! And the winner is : Destructor ! I 've not seen such a spectacle in all my years impersonating a sportscaster . Interesting side note : As a head without a body , I envy the dead . No argument here . I heard somebody got flattened ! Fry , where 's your brain slug ? Poor little guy starved to death . I 'm proud of you . Sure , you lost . You lost bad . But I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school . I 'm in tremendous pain here . Great job . You lost , and you made it look almost half real . Here 's a card good for 10 % off at Bed Bath Beyond . Yes ! I 'm the greatest ! The greatest ! Oh ... So ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport . - He didn 't look half bad in the tutu . - That he did surely not . What ? Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH ]

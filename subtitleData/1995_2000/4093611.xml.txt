 [ Faint Tapping ] [ Fire Searing ] [ Pressing Down On Needle ] [ Woman Over P.A. Speaking Esperanto ] [ Woman Over P.A. ] WELCOME TO GATTACA . GATTACA TIME : 7 : 14 . [ Click ] [ Soft Ring ] [ Click ] [ Soft Ring ] [ Soft Ring ] [ Click ] [ Soft Ring ] [ Soft Rings Continue ] [ Air Blowing ] [ Footsteps ] YOU KEEP YOUR WORK STATION SO ... CLEAN , JEROME . IT 'S NEXT TO GODLINESS . ISN 'T THAT WHAT THEY SAY ? " GODLINESS ? " I REVIEWED YOUR FLIGHT PLAN . NOT ONE ERROR IN A MILLION KEYSTROKES . PHENOMENAL . IT 'S RIGHT THAT SOMEONE LIKE YOU ... IS TAKING US TO TITAN . HAS THE COMMITTEE APPROVED THE MISSION ? THERE 'S BEEN TALK OF DELAY . YOU SHOULDN 'T LISTEN TO " TALK . " YOU LEAVE IN A WEEK . YOU 'VE GOT A SUBSTANCE TEST . [ Woman Over P.A. Speaking Esperanto ] [ Woman Over P.A. ] IF YOU HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF A SUBSTANCE ANALYSIS , PLEASE REPORT TO THE TESTING CENTER . [ Urinating ] HMPH . JEROME , NEVER SHY . PISSES ON COMMAND . YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THERE , JEROME . HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU THAT ? ONLY EVERY TIME I 'M IN HERE . OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD . I SEE A GREAT MANY ON A COURSE OF ANY GIVEN DAY . YOURS JUST HAPPENS TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE . [ Sighs ] I DON 'T KNOW WHY MY FOLKS DIDN 'T ORDER ONE LIKE THAT FOR ME . [ Computer Whirring ] [ Computer Rings Softly ] [ Man ] BY THE WAY , HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU ABOUT MY SON ? NO , YOU HAVEN 'T . REMIND ME TO SOMETIME . SO , YOU 'RE ABOUT TO GO UP . ONE WEEK LEFT . PLEASE TELL ME YOU 'RE THE LEAST BIT EXCITED . I 'LL TELL YOU AT THE END OF THE WEEK . CONGRATULATIONS , JEROME . THANK YOU . [ Woman ] HOW MANY LAUNCHES ARE THERE IN A DAY ? A DOZEN ? SOMETIMES MORE . YOU 'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WATCHES EVERY ONE OF THEM . IF YOU 'RE GOING TO PRETEND LIKE YOU DON 'T CARE , DON 'T LOOK UP . [ Man Narrating ] THE MOST UNREMARKABLE OF EVENTS . JEROME MORROW , NAVIGATOR , FIRST CLASS , IS ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A ONE YEAR MANNED-MISSION TO TITAN , THE 14th MOON OF SATURN . A HIGHLY PRESTIGIOUS ASSIGNMENT . ALTHOUGH , FOR JEROME , SELECTION WAS VIRTUALLY GUARANTEED AT BIRTH . HE 'S BLESSED WITH ALL THE GIFTS REQUIRED FOR SUCH AN UNDERTAKING . A GENETIC QUOTIENT SECOND TO NONE . NO , THERE IS TRULY NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF JEROME MORROW , EXCEPT THATIAM NOT JEROME MORROW . # # # # [ Classical ] I WAS CONCEIVED IN THE RIVIERA . NOT THE FRENCH RIVIERA . THE DETROIT VARIETY . THEY USED TO SAY THAT A CHILD CONCEIVED IN LOVE HAS A GREATER CHANCE OF HAPPINESS . THEY DON 'T SAY THAT ANYMORE . I 'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT POSSESSED MY MOTHER TO PUT HER FAITH IN GOD 'S HANDS , RATHER THAN THOSE OF HER LOCAL GENETICIST . [ Baby Crying ] TEN FINGERS , TEN TOES , THAT 'S ALL THAT USED TO MATTER . NOT NOW . [ Air Hissing ] NOW , ONLY SECONDS OLD , THE EXACT TIME AND CAUSE OF MY DEATH WAS ALREADY KNOWN . - [ Machine Beeps ] - [ Crying Continues ] " NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION : 60 % PROBABILITY . " MANIC DEPRESSION : 42 % PROBABILITY . " ATTENTION-DEFICIT DISORDER : 89 % PROBABILITY . " HEART DISORDER : " 99 % PROBABILITY . EARLY FATAL POTENTIAL . LIFE EXPECTANCY : 30.2 YEARS . " [ Tearing Papers ] THIRTY YEARS ? - THE NAME FOR THE CERTIFICATE ? - ANTON . NO ! UM , VINCENT ANTON . YEAH . THAT 'S A GOOD NAME . [ Crying Continues ] I KNOW HE 'LL DO SOMETHING . YOU 'LL DO SOMETHING . [ Woman ] VINCENT . [ Vincent Narrating ] FROM AN EARLY AGE , I CAME TO THINK OF MYSELF ... VINCENT . AS OTHERS THOUGHT OF ME : CHRONICALLY ILL . EVERY SKINNED KNEE AND RUNNY NOSE WAS TREATED AS IF IT WERE LIFE-THREATENING . I 'M SORRY . THE INSURANCE WON 'T COVER IT . IF HE FELL- - BUT I WAS TOLD THAT EVERYTHING- - I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO . [ Children Shouting , Playing ] [ Vincent Narrating ] LIKE MOST OTHER PARENTS OF THEIR DAY , THEY WERE DETERMINED THAT THEIR NEXT CHILD WOULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD , IN WHAT HAS BECOME , THE NATURAL WAY . [ Man ] YOUR EXTRACTED EGGS , UH , " MARIE , " HAVE BEEN FERTILIZED WITH ... " ANTONIO 'S " SPERM . AFTER SCREENING , WE ARE LEFT , AS YOU SEE , WITH TWO HEALTHY BOYS ... AND TWO VERY HEALTHY GIRLS . NATURALLY , NO CRITICAL PREDISPOSITIONS TO ANY OF THEMAJORINHERITABLE DISEASES . ALL THAT REMAINS IS TO SELECT THE MOST COMPATIBLE CANDIDATE . FIRST , WE MAY AS WELL DECIDE ON GENDER . HAVE YOU GIVEN IT ANY THOUGHT ? WE WOULD WANT VINCENT TO HAVE A BROTHER , YOU KNOW- - TO PLAY WITH . - OF COURSE YOU WOULD . HELLO , VINCENT . - [ Whispers ] HI . NOW , YOU HAVE SPECIFIED HAZEL EYES , DARK HAIR AND , UH , FAIR SKIN . I 'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF ERADICATING ANY POTENTIALLY PREJUDICIAL CONDITIONS : PREMATURE BALDNESS , MYOPIA , ALCOHOLISM AND ADDICTIVE SUSCEPTIBILITY , A PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE , OBESITY , ETCETERA . WE DIDN 'T WANT- - I MEAN , DISEASES , YES , BUT , UH- - RIGHT . WE WERE JUST WONDERING IF , IF IT 'S GOOD TO JUST LEAVE A FEW THINGS TO CHANCE ? WE WANT TO GIVE YOUR CHILD THE BEST POSSIBLE START . BELIEVE ME , WE HAVE ENOUGH IMPERFECTION BUILT IN ALREADY . YOUR CHILD DOESN 'T NEED ANY ADDITIONAL BURDENS . AND KEEP IN MIND , THIS CHILD IS STILL YOU . SIMPLY , THE BEST OF YOU . YOU COULD CONCEIVE NATURALLY A THOUSAND TIMES AND NEVER GET SUCH A RESULT . [ Vincent Narrating ] THAT 'S HOW MY BROTHER , ANTON , CAME INTO THE WORLD . A SON MY FATHER CONSIDERED WORTHY OF HIS NAME . YOU 'RE GETTING TALL , HUH ? WHAT DID I TELL YOU ? YOU SEE HOW MUCH HE 'S GROWN ? [ Waves Crashing Against Shore ] [ Narrating ] BY THE TIME WE WERE PLAYING AT BLOOD BROTHERS , I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FLOWING THROUGH MY VEINS . AND I 'D NEED AN AWFUL LOT MORE THAN A DROP IF I WAS GOING TO GET ANYWHERE . [ Anton Running Away ] OUR FAVORITE GAME WAS " CHICKEN . " WHEN OUR PARENTS WEREN 'T WATCHING , WE USED TO SWIM AS FAR OUT AS WE DARED . IT WAS ABOUT WHO WOULD GET SCARED AND TURN BACK FIRST . [ Panting ] COME ON , YOU COWARD ! [ Narrating ] OF COURSE , IT WAS ALWAYS ME . ANTON WAS BY FAR THE STRONGER SWIMMER , AND HE HAD NO EXCUSE TO FAIL . [ Vincent Counting ] THREE HUNDRED MILLION , 350 MILLION , 400 MILLION- - [ Narrating ] MAYBE IT WAS THE LOVE OF THE PLANETS , MAYBE IT WAS JUST MY GROWING DISLIKE FOR THIS ONE , BUT FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER , I HAVE DREAMED OF GOING INTO SPACE . ... 700 MILLION , 750 MILLION , 800 MILLION , 850 MILLION . HOW MANY ASTRONAUTS ARE THERE ANYWAY ? I BET I COULD BE ONE , IF I WANTED . HEY , DON 'T EAT THAT ! IT 'S PLUTO . [ Narrating ] MY GOALS DIDN 'T CHANGE A LOT IN THE INTERVENING YEARS , VINCENT . MUCH TO MY PARENTS ' DISMAY . VINCENT . YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC . WITH A HEART CONDITION LIKE YOURS- - MOM , THERE 'S A CHANCE THERE 'S NOTHING EVEN WRONG WITH MY HEART . ONE CHANCE IN A HUNDRED . WELL , I 'LL TAKE IT , ALL RIGHT . [ Marie ] THE TROUBLE IS ... THEY WON 'T . LISTEN , FOR GOD 'S SAKE , YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND SOMETHING . THE ONLY WAY YOU 'LL SEE THE INSIDE OF A SPACESHIP IS IF YOU WERE CLEANING IT . [ Narrating ] MY FATHER WAS RIGHT . IT DIDN 'T MATTER HOW MUCH I LIED ON MY RESUME . MY REAL RESUME WAS IN MY CELLS . [ Footsteps ] WHY SHOULD ANYBODY INVEST ALL THAT MONEY TO TRAIN ME ... WHEN THERE ARE A THOUSAND OTHER APPLICANTS WITH A FAR CLEANER PROFILE ? OF COURSE , IT 'S ILLEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE . " GENOISM , " IT 'S CALLED . BUT NO ONE TAKES THE LAW SERIOUSLY . [ Narrating ] IF YOU REFUSED TO DISCLOSE , THEY CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SAMPLE FROM A DOOR HANDLE , OR A HANDSHAKE , EVEN IN THE SALIVA ON YOUR APPLICATION FORM . IF IN DOUBT , A LEGAL DRUG TEST CAN JUST AS EASILY BECOME ... AN ILLEGAL PEEK AT YOUR FUTURE IN THE COMPANY . YOU SURE YOU WANNA DO THIS ? YOU KNOW YOU 'RE GONNA LOSE . [ Narrating ] IT WAS THE LAST TIME WE SWAM TOGETHER ... OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA . LIKE ALWAYS , KNOWING EACH STROKE TO THE HORIZON ... WAS ONE WE 'D HAVE TO MAKE BACK TO THE SHORE . [ Panting ] [ Narrating ] BUT SOMETHING WAS VERY DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT DAY . EVERY TIME ANTON TRIED TO PULL AWAY , HE FOUND ME RIGHT BESIDE HIM . UNTIL FINALLY , THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPENED . VINCENT ! VINCENT ! [ Gasps ] IT WAS THE ONE MOMENT IN OUR LIVES ... THAT MY BROTHER WAS NOT AS STRONG AS HE BELIEVED , AND I WAS NOT AS WEAK . IT WAS THE MOMENT THAT MADE EVERYTHING ELSE POSSIBLE . LIKE MANY OTHERS IN MY SITUATION , I MOVED AROUND A LOT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS , GETTING WORK WHERE I COULD . I MUST 'VE CLEANED HALF THE TOILETS IN THE STATE . I BELONGED TO A NEW UNDERCLASS , NO LONGER DETERMINED BY SOCIAL STATUS OR THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN . [ Man ] WELCOME TO GATTACA , GENTLEMEN . [ Narrating ] NO , WE NOW HAVE DISCRIMINATION DOWN TO A SCIENCE . [ Man ] ALL RIGHT , THERE 'S YOUR CLEANING MATERIAL . START FROM THE FRONT AND CLEAN ALL THE WAY BACK ! [ Rocket Blasting Off ] AND I WANNA SEE MY SMILING FACE ON THAT FLOOR . WHAT ABOUT YOU , YOUR MAJESTY ? YOU DREAMIN ' OF SPACE ? COME HERE . YOU CAN START BY CLEANING THIS SPACE RIGHT HERE . [ Narrating ] I WAS NEVER MORE CERTAIN OF HOW FAR AWAY I WAS FROM MY GOAL ... THAN WHEN I WAS STANDING RIGHT BESIDE IT . [ Shuts Buffer Off ] [ Tapping Keyboard ] [ Turns Buffer On ] WHEN YOU CLEAN THE GLASS , VINCENT , DON 'T CLEAN IT TOO WELL . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? YOU MIGHT GET IDEAS . YEAH , BUT IF THE GLASS IS CLEAN , IT 'LL BE EASIER FOR YOU TO SEE ME WHEN I 'M ON THE OTHER SIDE . HA ! - [ Click ] - [ Alarm Beeping Softly ] [ Exhales Deeply ] [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] [ Narrating ] FOR ALL MY BRAVE TALK , I KNEW IT WAS JUST THAT . NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRAINED OR HOW MUCH I STUDIED , THE BEST TEST SCORE IN THE WORLD WASN 'T GONNA MATTER UNLESS I HAD THE BLOOD TEST TO GO WITH IT . I MADE UP MY MIND TO RESORT TO MORE EXTREME MEASURES . THE MAN WHO SHOWED UP AT MY DOORSTEP DIDN 'T EXACTLY ADVERTISE IN THE YELLOW PAGES . STAND STRAIGHT . HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT ME ? PEOPLE . ANY DISTINGUISHING MARKS , TATTOOS , SCARS , BIRTHMARKS ? UH- - I DON 'T THINK SO . YOU 'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS ? I HOPE YOU 'RE NOT WASTING MY TIME . NO , I , I 'D- - I 'D GIVE 100 % . THAT WOULD GET YOU HALFWAY THERE . THAT- - THAT 'S AN OLD EDITION , BUT ... I KNOW IT ALL BY HEART . BY HEART , HUH ? YOU REALIZE THE COMMITMENT IS BINDING ? YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN MIND ? [ Narrating ] FOR THE GENETICALLY SUPERIOR , SUCCESS IS EASIER TO ATTAIN , BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS GUARANTEED . AFTER ALL , THERE IS NO GENE FOR FATE . AND WHEN , FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER , A MEMBER OF THE ELITE FALLS ON HARD TIMES , THEIR GENETIC IDENTITY BECOMES A VALUED COMMODITY FOR THE UNSCRUPULOUS . ONE MAN 'S LOSS IS ANOTHER MAN 'S GAIN . [ Man ] HIS CREDENTIALS ARE IMPECCABLE . AN EXPIRATION DATE YOU WOULDN 'T BELIEVE . [ Whispering ] THE GUY 'S PRACTICALLY GONNA LIVE FOREVER . HE 'S GOT AN I.Q. OFF THE REGISTER . BETTER THAN 20 / 20 IN BOTH EYES . AND THE HEART OF AN OX . HE COULD RUN THROUGH A WALL , IF HE COULD STILL RUN . ACTUALLY , HE WAS A BIG-TIME SWIMMING STAR . VINCENT , YOU COULD GO ANYWHERE ... WITH THIS GUY 'S HELIX TUCKED UNDER YOUR ARM . WHAT DID I TELL YOU ? YOU LOOK SO RIGHT TOGETHER I WANNA DOUBLE MY FEE . WE DON 'T LOOK ANYTHING ALIKE . IT 'S CLOSE ENOUGH . WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME ANYBODY LOOKED AT A PHOTOGRAPH ? YOU COULD HAVE MY FACE ON YOUR NAME TAG , FOR CHRIST 'S SAKE . HOW DO I EXPLAIN THE ACCIDENT ? THAT 'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING . IT HAPPENED OUT OF THE COUNTRY . THERE 'S NO RECORD HE EVER BROKE HIS BACK . AS FAR AS ANYONE 'S CONCERNED , HE 'S STILL A WALKING , TALKING , FULLY PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY . YOU JUST HAVE TO GET HIM CLEAN AND FILL IN THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE . YOU 'RE A FOREIGNER . THEY DON 'T CARE WHERE YOU WERE BORN , JUST HOW . BLOOD HAS NO NATIONALITY . AS LONG AS IT 'S GOT WHAT THEY 'RE LOOKING FOR , IT 'S THE ONLY PASSPORT YOU NEED . WHO LIVES UP THERE ? WELL , I CERTAINLY DON 'T . [ Narrating ] SO BEGAN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING JEROME . MYOPIA IS ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGNS OF A DISADVANTAGED BIRTH . ISN 'T THERE ANOTHER WAY ? NO . SURGERY 'S NO GOOD . THEY 'LL SEE THE SCARS . IT 'S CONTACT LENSES OR A WHITE CANE . BESIDES , THE COLOR DOESN 'T MATCH . HE 'S RIGHT . MY EYES ARE PRETTIER . [ Laser Humming ] YOU UNDERSTAND I TAKE 25 % OF EVERYTHING YOU MAKE . IF FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN 'T WORK OUT , ALL THIS EQUIPMENT MUST BE RETURNED WITHIN SEVEN DAYS , AND YOU DON 'T GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK . WAIT , WAIT , WAIT . I THOUGHT YOU SAID 20 % . [ Mumbling ] YOU TOLD ME 20 % . TWENTY PERCENT ! IT 'S NOT NEGOTIABLE . - I GUESS THAT 'S IT . - NOT QUITE . WHY ? THERE 'S STILL THE MATTER OF THE HEIGHT . - WHY ? HOW TALL ARE YOU ? - FOUR FOOT , SIX . HOW TALL WERE YOU BEFORE THE ACCIDENT ? UNFORTUNATELY , HIS PROFILE SAYS HE 'S SIX , ONE . SO , I CAN WEAR LIFTS . [ Sighs ] EVEN WITH LIFTS , YOU 'RE NOT THAT TALL . SO , WHAT ? NO . NO . NO , WE NEVER DISCUSSED THAT . OHH . - I THOUGHT YOU WERE SERIOUS . - I AM SERIOUS . I 'M NOT DOING THAT . I WON 'T DO THAT . [ Narrating ] JEROME NEVER QUESTIONED MY COMMITMENT AGAIN . I TOOK MY MIND OFF THE PAIN BY REMINDING MYSELF THAT WHEN I EVENTUALLY DID STAND UP , I 'D BE EXACTLY TWO INCHES CLOSER TO THE STARS . ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? YEAH . DO YOU WANNA GO DANCING ? YOU HAD TO BE A RIGHT-HANDER , HUH ? I GUESS NO ONE ORDERS SOUTHPAWS ANYMORE . JEROME MORROW . IT 'S A NICE NAME . IT 'S MY NAME . I CAN 'T BE YOU WITHOUT IT . WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN BE ME AT ALL ? [ Tapping Pen ] LOOK AT THIS . LOOK AT IT . IT 'S NICE . I 'M IMPRESSED . IS IT REAL ? ARE YOU COLOR BLIND , TOO , VINCENT ? IT 'S SILVER . SO ? JEROME MORROW WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE ONE STEP DOWN ON THE PODIUM . WITH ALL I HAD GOING FOR ME , I WAS STILL SECOND BEST . ME . SO HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO PULL THIS OFF ? I DON 'T KNOW , EXACTLY . YOUR SIGNATURE NEEDS WORK . [ Narrating ] IT SOON CAME TIME TO PUT OUR PREPARATIONS TO THE TEST . JEROME HAD BEEN ENGINEERED WITH EVERYTHING HE NEEDED TO GET HIM TO GATTACA , EXCEPT THE DESIRE TO DO SO . DO YOU REALLY WANNA BE IN THERE ? I DON 'T WANNA BE IN THERE . I WANNA BE UP THERE . [ Jerome ] WHAT 'S UP THERE ? THAT 'S WHAT I WANNA FIND OUT , JEROME . CALL ME EUGENE . MY MIDDLE NAME . IF YOU 'RE GONNA BE JEROME , YOU BETTER START GETTING USED TO IT . I GOTTA GET GOING . WHERE 'S MY SAMPLE ? [ Jerome ] IN THE REFRIGERATOR . DOOR ON THE LEFT . - WHICH POUCH ? - OH , ANY OF THEM . YOU THINK I SHOULD TEST IT ? IF YOU LIKE . - [ Beeping ] - MY GOD ! WHAT 'S WRONG WITH THE MACHINE ? THERE 'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE MACHINE . IT 'S A HOT SAMPLE . YOU 'VE BEEN DRINKING AGAIN . I HAVEN 'T . OH , CHRIST , EUGENE ! IT 'S 8 : 00 IN THE MORNING . I HAVEN 'T ! [ Groans ] [ Machine Whirring ] [ Beeping ] THIS IS NO JOKE ! MY INTERVIEW IS IN AN HOUR ! [ Beeping ] THERE IS MORE VODKA IN THIS PISS THAN THERE IS PISS . ALL RIGHT , I 'M SORRY . I HAD HALF A GLASS TO CELEBRATE . I 'M SORRY . TRY FRIDAY 'S . THAT ONE WILL BE OKAY . THERE 'S ONLY WEDNESDAY LEFT . - WEDNESDAY , THAT 'S THE ONE . - [ Sighs ] [ Soft Ringing ] LISTEN , IT 'S NOT TOO LATE TO BACK OUT . THIS IS THE LAST DAY THAT YOU 'RE GONNA BE YOU AND I 'M GONNA BE ME . WELL ? [ Woman Over P.A. Speaking Esperanto ] [ Tapping Machine 's Controls ] [ Machine Whirring ] [ Soft Ring ] CONGRATULATIONS . WELL , WHAT ABOUT THE INTERVIEW ? THAT WAS IT . I GOT IT . OF COURSE YOU GOT IT . [ Narrating ] AND THAT 'S THE WAY IT WAS . EACH DAY I WOULD DISPOSE OF AS MUCH LOOSE SKIN , FINGERNAILS AND HAIR AS POSSIBLE ... TO LIMIT TO HOW MUCH OF MY " IN-VALID " SELF ... I WOULD LEAVE IN THE " VALID " WORLD . AT THE SAME TIME , EUGENE PREPARED SAMPLES OF HIS OWN SUPERIOR BODY MATTER , SO THAT I MIGHT PASS FOR HIM : CUSTOMIZED URINE POUCHES FOR THE FREQUENT SUBSTANCE TESTS ; FINGERTIP BLOOD SACHETS FOR SECURITY CHECKS , AND VIALS FILLED WITH OTHER TRACES . WHILE EUGENE SUPPLIED ME WITH A NEW IDENTITY , I PAID THE RENT ... AND KEPT HIM IN THE STYLE TO WHICH HE 'D BECOME ACCUSTOMED . EUGENE NEVER SUFFERED FROM THE ROUTINE DISCRIMINATION OF A " UTERO , " " FAITH BIRTH , " OR " IN-VALID , " AS WE WERE CALLED . A " VALID , " A " VITRO , " A " MADE MAN . " HE SUFFERED UNDER A DIFFERENT BURDEN : THE BURDEN OF PERFECTION . I WAS NOW A MEMBER OF A RELATIVELY NEW ... AND PARTICULARLY DETESTED SEGMENT OF SOCIETY ; ONE OF THOSE WHO REFUSES TO PLAY THE HAND THAT HE WAS DEALT . I AM MOST COMMONLY KNOWN AS A " BORROWED LADDER , " OR A " DE-GENE-ERATE . " [ Wind Gusting ] IN THE GUISE OF JEROME MORROW , I HAVE RISEN QUICKLY THROUGH THE RANKS OF GATTACA . ONLY ONE OF THE MISSION DIRECTORS HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO DISCOVERING MY TRUE IDENTITY . IT 'S STRANGE TO THINK HE MAY HAVE MORE SUCCESS EXPOSING ME IN DEATH THAN HE EVER DID ... IN LIFE . [ Woman Over P.A. Speaking Esperanto ] [ Woman Over P.A. ] LEVEL " A " IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED . WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE . [ Man ] WELL , I THINK WE CAN RULE OUT SUICIDE . [ Man # 2 ] EXCUSE ME , SIR ? NOTHING . THANK YOU . THIS IS GONNA TAKE A WHILE . YOU MAY HAVE TO PUSH THINGS BACK . IRENE , I WANT YOU TO ASSIST THE INVESTIGATORS . MY WORK , DIRECTOR . THAT WOULD PUT ME BEHIND . UH , I APPRECIATE YOUR SACRIFICE , IRENE . WILL YOU SEE TO IT I DON 'T LOSE MY PLACE IN LINE ? YOUR PLACE IS ASSURED . SO , WILL YOU KINDLY INFORM THE AUTHORITIES THAT WE WILL COOPERATE ... IN ANY WAY . ALTHOUGH , WE CAN 'T TOLERATE A MAJOR DISRUPTION . DIRECTOR- - - THANK YOU , IRENE . - THANK YOU , DIRECTOR . DIRECTOR , HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE MISSION ? OH , WE 'RE STILL GOING AHEAD AS PLANNED . THE LAUNCH WINDOW 'S ONLY OPEN UNTIL WEEK 'S END , AND TRAGIC THOUGH THIS EVENT MAY BE , IT HASN 'T STOPPED THE PLANETS ' TURNING , HAS IT ? WHAT HAPPENED ? I 'M GOIN ' UP . WHEN ? END OF THE WEEK . END OF THE WEEK ? THAT SOON ? WHAT ABOUT THE MISSION DIRECTOR ? HE 'S DEAD . ARE YOU SERIOUS ? THEY FOUND HIM IN HIS OFFICE THIS MORNING BEATEN SO BADLY THEY HAD TO CHECK HIS NAME TAG . YOU ARE SERIOUS . SO , THAT 'S IT . THERE 'S NOTHING BETWEEN US ... AND IGNITION . I 'M GOIN ' UP . THE MAN WAS MURDERED . SO ? I DIDN 'T DO IT . I DIDN 'T SAY YOU DID , BUT IF THE MAN WAS MURDERED , THE PLACE IS GONNA BE CRAWLING WITH HOOVERS . I 'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE J. EDGARS OVER THE MISSION DIRECTOR . WHAT IF THEY DO FIND SOMETHING ? I 'M GONNA BE SLIGHTLY OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION . WE HAVE TO GET DRUNK IMMEDIATELY . # # # # [ Classical ] GOOD EVENING , GENTLEMEN . GOOD EVENING . I HOPE OUR TABLE 'S READY . I UNDERSTAND YOU 'RE LEAVING US , MR. MORROW . LOOKS THAT WAY . WE 'RE GOING TO MISS YOU . YOU 'VE OPENED THE WINE , I HOPE ? OF COURSE , SIR . POUR YOURSELF A GLASS , CAVENDISH . THANK YOU , SIR . HOW OLD ? ME ? - THE SPECIMEN ? - I KISSED HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO ; A REAL GOOD ONE . I 'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO . [ Woman ] YOU WANT THE FULL SEQUENCE ? YES . THANK YOU . GOOD LUCK . [ Machine Beeps ] [ Woman Over P.A. Speaking English ] NINE POINT THREE . QUITE A CATCH . YES . QUITE A CATCH . [ Woman Over P.A. ] SEQUENCING WHILE-YOU-WAIT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE ... FOR ANY LOST OR DAMAGED SPECIMENS . SOME SAMPLES MAY BE CONSUMED IN THE SEQUENCING PROCESS . [ People Chattering , Laughing ] OH , GOD ! HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD CAVENDISH- - THIS CAN 'T HAVE BEEN OPENED MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AGO ! A WINE LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BREATHE . YOU REMEMBER THAT . YOU KNOW , THEY SAY WHEN YOU 'RE WEIGHTLESS , IT 'S THE CLOSEST THING TO BEING IN THE WOMB . I CAN 'T BELIEVE YOU PULLED THIS OFF . THEY 'RE SENDING YOU UP THERE . UP THERE , FOR CHRIST SAKE , YOU OF ALL PEOPLE . I HATE TO THINK OF YOU ALONE IN THAT ROOM FOR A YEAR . WELL , DON 'T THINK ABOUT IT . ANYWAY , THE ROOM I 'M STUCK IN IS BIGGER THAN YOUR TIN CAN . YOU KNOW WHAT I 'M SAYIN ' . WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ? I HAVE MY BOOKS . I GO PLACES IN MY HEAD . [ Chuckling ] I 'D BE HAPPIER IF YOU HAD SOME COMPANY . I HAVE VISITORS . YEAH , WELL , NONE THAT YOU DON 'T PAY . I WOULDN 'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY . SERIOUSLY , WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ? I 'M GONNA FINISH THIS . WHAT 'S TITAN LIKE THIS TIME OF YEAR ? [ Laughing ] WHAT 'S TITAN LIKE ? TITAN ... IS EXACTLY LIKE THIS . ALL THE TIME . IT 'S GOT A CLOUD AROUND IT SO THICK NOBODY CAN TELL WHAT 'S UNDERNEATH . MAYBE THERE 'S NOTHING THERE . THERE 'S SOMETHING THERE . YOU SHOULD BE GOING INSTEAD OF ME . WHY IS THAT ? 'CAUSE UP THERE YOUR LEGS WOULDN 'T MATTER . I 'M SCARED OF HEIGHTS . [ Machine Buzzes ] [ Retching ] I 'M SORRY . DO YOU WANT THIS ? I 'LL SAVE SOME FOR YOU , SHALL I ? [ Laughing ] [ Groans ] I 'M SO SORRY . I 'M REALLY SORRY . YOU KNOW YOU 'RE NOT THAT SORRY . I 'M REALLY , REALLY SORRY . DON 'T GIMME A HARD TIME . GIMME A BREAK . [ Grunts ] [ Gasps ] OH , COME ON ! COME ON ! HELP . I 'M SORRY . HELP . I 'M SORRY . [ Grunts ] [ Panting ] YOU KNOW , I WASN 'T DRUNK . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , YOU 'RE NOT DRUNK ? WHEN I WALKED IN FRONT OF THAT CAR . WHAT CAR ? I STEPPED RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF IT . I 'D NEVER BEEN MORE SOBER IN MY LIFE . GO TO SLEEP . COULDN 'T EVEN GET THAT RIGHT , COULD I ? IF AT FIRST YOU DON 'T SUCCEED , [ Whispering ] TRY , TRY AGAIN . GO TO SLEEP . I 'M PROUD OF YOU , VINCENT . YOU MUST BE DRUNK TO CALL ME VINCENT . [ Scanners Beeping ] [ Computer Continuously Ringing Softly ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Beeps ] [ Heart Beating ] HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED ? TWENTY MINUTES . YOU CAN GO . IT 'S ALL RIGHT , IRENE . YOU 'RE EXCUSED . [ Heartbeats Thumping ] WE FOUND OUR MAN . IT 'S THE ONLY SPECIMEN IN THE ENTIRE PLACE THAT CAN 'T BE ACCOUNTED FOR . EVERY TEN YEARS OR SO , THINGS GO OUR WAY . THE EYELASH , WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT ? IT 'S AN UNREGISTERED IN-VALID . HE WAS A JANITOR HERE UNTIL A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN HE DISAPPEARED OUT OF SIGHT . SO THE SPECIMEN COULD 'VE BEEN HERE SINCE THEN . TAKE A LOOK AT THE FLOOR . I DON 'T THINK ANYTHING LAYS AROUND HERE FOR VERY LONG . ALSO THE MATTER OF MOTIVE . IS THE JANITOR GONNA COME BACK HERE AFTER ALL THIS TIME TO KILL A MAN HE NEVER KNEW ? HIS PROFILE DOES SUGGEST A VIOLENT TEMPERAMENT . IF I 'M NOT MISTAKEN , HIS PROFILE ALSO SUGGESTS HE 'S A SICK MAN . NINETY PERCENT CHANCE THE OWNER OF THIS EYELASH HAS ALREADY DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES . THAT MEANS THERE 'S A TEN PERCENT CHANCE HE 'S STILL ALIVE . IT 'S A LOST-AND-FOUND CASE . ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIND THE MAN WHO 'S MINUS AN EYELASH , WE HAVE THE MURDERER . I 'LL DO A CROSS-CHECK . FIND OUT ABOUT HIS FAMILY- - I 'VE ALREADY RUN IT . THERE 'S NO RECORD OF ANY LIVING RELATIVE . THAT 'S A DAMN SHAME , SIR . I WANT YOU TO CHECK THE ENTRY LOG , ALIBIS , GRUDGES . I LOOK AROUND , I SEE A LOT OF DRY EYES . THE MISSION DIRECTOR WAS NOT , UH , UNIVERSALLY LOVED . HE WAS LEADING THE CUTBACKS IN THE PROGRAM . WITH ALL DUE RESPECT , SIR- - WHATEVER YOU SAY . [ Heartbeats Continue Thumping ] [ Beeps ] JEROME , JEROME , THE METRONOME . YOU COULD PLAY THE PIANO BY THAT HEARTBEAT OF HIS . MR. DIRECTOR , YOU WILL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A SUSPECT . THAT IS A RELIEF . WHO IS IT ? WE FOUND AN UNACCOUNTED-FOR SPECIMEN IN THE SOUTH WING , AND HERE 'S HIS PICTURE . AN IN-VALID ? WE ARE STILL FOLLOWING OTHER LEADS . BE THAT AS IT MAY , I 'M HAVING THIS POSTED IMMEDIATELY . I 'M CURIOUS , DIRECTOR . AN ADVANTAGE , I SHOULD IMAGINE , IN YOUR LINE OF WORK . [ Scoffs ] YOUR , UH , HIRING PRACTICES . [ Director ] OUR RECRUITMENT PHILOSOPHY . WHO DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO BE HERE ? [ Director ] WELL , NATURALLY , OUR STANDARD IS BEYOND THAT OF THE COMMON CITIZEN . EVEN AMONGST YOUR PEOPLE , YOU MUST HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF EXCELLENCE . OCCASIONALLY , WE 'VE BEEN FORCED TO ACCEPT CANDIDATES ... WITH MINOR SHORTCOMINGS , BUT NOTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT SOMEONE FROM WORKING IN A FIELD SUCH AS ... LAW ENFORCEMENT , FOR EXAMPLE . BUT NOW THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE ... TO WARRANT A NEW MEASURING STICK . BODIES WITH MINDS TO MATCH . ESSENTIAL AS WE PUSH OUT FURTHER AND FURTHER . YET YOU STILL CLOSELY MONITOR PERFORMANCE . [ Director ] WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE MEETING THEIR POTENTIAL . - AND EXCEEDING IT ? - NO ONE EXCEEDS HIS POTENTIAL . - IF HE DID ? - IT WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT WE DID NOT ACCURATELY ... GAUGE HIS POTENTIAL IN THE FIRST PLACE . - [ Click ] - [ Rapid Heartbeats ] [ Heartbeats Stop ] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT , JEROME ? TERRIFIC . [ Panting ] [ Coughing ] [ Woman Over P.A. ] ASSURE YOUR PLACE IN LINE BY MEETING YOUR POTENTIAL . THIS IS THE ENTRY LOG FOR THE LAST SEVEN DAYS . WHAT ABOUT YOU , IRENE ? DO YOU HAVE AN ALIBI ? I WAS ALONE . I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE . EXCUSE ME . I 'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR YOU , MR. MORROW . [ Rocket Blasting Off ] I SEE I 'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO LOOKS UP EVERY TIME THERE 'S A LAUNCH . HELLO , JEROME . HELLO . IT 'S AWFUL ABOUT THE DIRECTOR . AWFUL IT DIDN 'T HAPPEN SOONER . [ Laughs ] DIDN 'T THE DIRECTOR THREATEN TO CANCEL YOUR MISSION MORE THAN ONCE , JEROME ? YES , HE DID . SOMEBODY DID YOU A FAVOR . DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA WHOSE HAND I SHOULD BE SHAKING ? THEY FOUND AN EYELASH IN THE SOUTH WING . DOES IT HAVE A NAME ? JUST SOME IN-VALID . JEROME . I HAD YOU SEQUENCED . I READ YOUR PROFILE . I 'M SORRY . IT SEEMS YOU 'RE EVERYTHING THEY SAY YOU ARE AND MORE . WHAT ABOUT YOU , IRENE ? YOU 'RE ENGINEERED JUST LIKE THE REST OF US . NOT QUITE LIKE THE REST OF YOU . " UNACCEPTABLE LIKELIHOOD OF HEART FAILURE . " I THINK THAT 'S WHAT THE MANUAL SAYS . THE ONLY TRIP I 'LL TAKE IN SPACE IS AROUND THE SUN ON THE SATELLITE RIGHT HERE . WELL , IF THERE 'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOU , I CAN 'T SEE IT FROM WHERE I 'M STANDING . IF YOU DON 'T BELIEVE ME , HERE , TAKE IT . IF YOU 'RE STILL INTERESTED , LET ME KNOW . I 'M SORRY . THE WIND CAUGHT IT . [ Tapping Keyboard ] [ Woman Over P.A. Speaking Esperanto ] [ Woman Over P.A. ] PLEASE CHECK THE LATEST GATTACA BULLETIN . [ Footsteps ] JEROME , IS THIS THE APPROACH PATH THAT WE DISCUSSED ? ABSOLUTELY , DIRECTOR . QUITE RIGHT . QUITE RIGHT . [ Jerome ] LISTEN TO WHAT I 'M SAYING TO YOU : I WANT WHAT I ORDERED . IT 'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COLOR . NOW I 'M BORED OF TALKING TO YOU . I 'M BORED . I 'LL CALL YOU BACK . THAT WAS THE COMPANY THAT SELL US YOUR HAIR DYE . THEY 'VE SENT ME SUMMER WHEAT INSTEAD OF HONEY DAWN . ANY FOOL KNOWS IT 'S TWO SHADES LIGHTER . SHE SAID , " WHY DON 'T YOU TRY CHANGE ? " I DON 'T WANT TO CHANGE . WE CAN 'T USE A CHANGE . NOW I 'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR THE FIVE BOXES THEY 'VE SENT ME . WE CAN 'T STAY HERE . IDIOTS I HAVE TO DEAL WITH , YOU WOULDN 'T BELIEVE . THEY THINK I KILLED THE MISSION DIRECTOR . - WHAT MAKES THEM THINK THAT ? - THEY FOUND MY EYELASH . - WHERE ? - IN THE CORRIDOR .

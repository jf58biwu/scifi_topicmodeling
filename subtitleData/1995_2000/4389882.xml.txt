 Just a minute . I 'll ... I 'll , I 'll be right there . I 'm coming. I 'm coming . Deanna ! Hello , Reg . I 'm so glad you could make it . It 's wonderful to see you . Would it be all right if I came inside ? Yeah . Of course . Of course ! Come in , come in . ls-is there something I can get you ? Some , um , some coffee ? Tea ? Oh , wait a minute . Don 't ... don 't tell me . Chocolate ice cream . You know me too well . But just one scoop . I 'm watching my figure . Why ? ! You ... you look lovely . You always knew how to flatter me . Would you like me to get it ? Get ... get what ? The ice cream . Right ! Right ! The ice cream . No , no . No , no , no . Come in , come in . Sit down ... make yourself comfortable . It 's a nice place . Thanks . One scoop of chocolate ice cream . Did you just move in ? No , no . I 've been here , uh ... almost two years . I just haven 't had a chance to unpack . is everything all right , Reg ? Of course . Why , why wouldn 't it be ? To be honest , you seem a little on edge . Do I ? Oh , oh , it 's just that I 'm ... I 'm excited to see you . I 'm excited to see you , too . I think Geordi 's a little disappointed I didn 't invite him to come along . Yes , I ... well , l-l was hoping to get ... get together with him , too , uh , before the Enterprise leaves orbit , but I just wanted to spend some time with you first . That 's all right , - isn 't it ? - Of course it is . I hear you 've been working on the Pathfinder Project . Well , I ... I was , uh ... I 'm not anymore . What happened ? Oh , uh ... nothing ... really . Just got to be a lot of , uh ... pressure . Well , hello ! Neelix ! Oh , he 's not used to company . Oh . It 's not polite to eat our guest 's food . If you 're hungry , just say so . Deanna , uh , Neelix . Neelix ? That 's an unusual name . Maybe we should introduce him to Data 's cat , Spot . I have a feeling you didn 't ask me here to reminisce . Tell me what 's wrong . I 've lost myself , Deanna . Lost yourself ? In Voyager . I 've become obsessed with Voyager . Here you are on shore leave and what do I do ? I lure you into a counseling session . Don 't worry about that . The important thing is I 'm here now , and I want to help . Thank you . Now ... start at the beginning . Has it ever occurred to you that a tachyon beam directed at a class-B itinerant pulsar could produce enough gravimetric energy to create an artificial singularity ? I can 't say it has . It occurred to me , but my supervisors thought it was an abuse of midas . midas ? The , uh , Mutara lnterdimensional Deep Space Transponder Array . Reg , you 're losing me . I 'm sorry . The beginning . The beginning- - right . Well , I suppose it all started in the holodeck . Doesn 't it always ? Go on . Well ... I ... I was running a few simulations . Computer , boost the gain on Voyager 's transceiver by 20 percent . Transceiver gain is at maximum . Apply a narrowband filter to the signal processor . Filter engaged . Voyager , come in . Come in , Voyager . Voyager , come in . This is Starfleet Command . Voyager , come in , Voyager . Good . Good , good . Now , lower the filter band by .3 kilohertz . Reg , what are you doing ? Oh . Uh , um , Pete . l-l-l was just , uh ... Yes , running another simulation . I can see that . What about the transmitter diagnostics ? Right . The diagnostics . You have finished them , haven 't you ? Uh ... almost . Almost isn 't good enough . We 've got Admiral Paris first thing in the morning . Admiral Paris ? Don 't tell me you forgot . Oh , no , of-of ... of course not . l-l-l just got the days mixed up . Reg ! Computer , end program . Now that I think about it , it 's a good thing that Admiral Paris is coming tomorrow . We can brief the Admiral on my theory . What theory ? I 've been going over the interstellar phenomena forecasts from Deep Space 9 . They are predicting , uh , a class-B itinerant pulsar will pass within four billion kilometers of the midas Array in three days . You think the pulsar might damage the Array ? No , no . The shields will hold . Actually , I was thinking , uh , we could use the pulsar to our own advantage . How ? Suppose ... suppose we instructed the Array to direct a tachyon beam at the pulsar . Theoretically , we could produce a gravimetric surge powerful enough to create an artificial wormhole . We could establish two-way communication with Voyager . Reg , you 're dreaming again . No , no , l-l really think this could work . Based on my simulations , that ... Based on your last series of simulations , we wasted six months trying to develop that transwarp probe . This ... this is different . This ... Reg ... I really appreciate your imagination . It 's what makes you such a valuable part of this team , but I 'm not about to tell the Admiral that we 've found a way for him to chat with his son because of some cockeyed theory that only exists up here . Now , please , finish those diagnostics . Yes , sir . And , Reg , remember- - while the Admiral 's here , I do the talking . You do the talking . Understood . Pete was only trying to look out for me , but I was sure my plan would work . I , I just couldn 't give it up . Burning the midnight oil . l-l finished , uh , the diagnostics , sir . Yes. I know . I looked them over . Good job . Well , why don 't you call it a day ? I just , uh , have a few more things to take care of . Well , see you tomorrow , then . Oh . Reg , why don 't , um ... why don 't you drop by tonight when you 're through here ? " Drop by " ? Come to the house . Have some coffee . Angie 's sister is in from Boston . I , uh ... I think she might like you . l-l don 't , I don 't think I ... can , uh ... I 'm spending the evening with , um ... Neelix . Correct me if I 'm wrong , Reg , but Neelix is your cat . Well , if you change your mind . Thanks . I 'll ... I 'll try . But I couldn 't leave , not until I 'd strengthened my case for accessing the midas Array . The meeting with Admiral Paris was only 14 hours away , and I hadn 't come up with anything . Poring over the data wasn 't helping . I decided that what I needed was , um , a little inspiration . Computer ... activate hologrid Mess Hall scenario Barclay 1 1-Gamma . Hey , Reg . Warning . The shark is circling . Let the games begin . What 'll it be , Reg ? The usual . Computer , one milk , warm . Oh , thanks , Harry . Just trying to get on your good side , so you 'll go easy on me tonight . Ah , you know what I always say- - if you can 't stand the heat ... Get out of the warp core . Sit down , Lieutenant , and give us mortals a chance to get even . That 's an order . If you insist , Commander , but I think it 's only fair to warn you I have no intention of letting my winning streak come to an end . Now , where 's , um , Tuvok ? He said it 's illogical to continue losing to a clearly superior player . Oh , that 's too bad . I love to watch that Vulcan squirm . Now , you all know the rules . Deuces , one-eyed jacks and suicide kings are wild . Five of a kind beats a straight flush every time . The man is ruthless . He 's a killer . Now , come on , guys . You know it hurts me to see you lose . After all , you are my best friends . I 'd hoped that the poker game would help calm my nerves , so that I could get a decent night 's sleep before the briefing , but when I got home that night , I couldn 't keep my mind off of Voyager . I needed to get back to the holodeck . That feels so good . Therapeutic massage can be an effective treatment for insomnia , Lieutenant . But we need to get to the cause of your sleeplessness if we 're going to find a more permanent solution . It 's just that every time l-l close my eyes , my mind starts to race . Can you be more specific ? Well , I worry about the project . Have I explored the problem from every angle , or is there something else I should be trying ? Am I doing enough ? Hmm . Acute work-related anxiety . Perhaps I should speak to the Captain about reducing your schedule . Oh , something tells me she 's not going to be able to help . You are an invaluable member of this crew , Mr. Barclay . Thank you , Doctor . It 's nice to be appreciated . Hmm . Oh ! Turning in , Reg ? Yes , sir . Hey , Reg . For some reason , I never slept in my apartment as comfortably as I did in my holographic quarters . I suppose I felt more at home on Voyager . Mm-hmm . Good morning , everyone . Morning , Reg . You 're awfully chipper . Ah ... slept like a baby . Then maybe you 've got the energy to whip up one of your famous cheese omelets . Oh , yeah. I 'm starved . I 'm sorry , guys. I have a very important briefing at 0900 . Just have time for coffee . Uh , don 't forget about tonight . Uh ... remind me . You were supposed to teach me how to play velocity . No . No way . Reg and I have a hoverball game scheduled . Don 't fight . Plenty of me to go around . Reg ... I 'm sorry to bother you again , but I 'm still having trouble with the warp core recalibration . It 's no problem . I 'll stop by Engineering later and talk you through it . Thank you . I really appreciate it . Velocity , hoverball , warp core recalibrations ? Reg , I don 't know how you do it . Let you in on a little secret . There 's two of me . The Delta Quadrant , Sector 417 51 , Grid 9 . Voyager 's Doctor reported this as the ship 's position when his program was briefly transferred to Starfleet two years ago . Assuming they 're still on course for Earth , we 've been able to extrapolate a range of likely trajectories . Estimating an average warp speed of 6.2 and accounting for various astronomical obstacles ... we can reasonably assume that Voyager is now in one of these three sectors . Can we contact them ? As you know , we 've been working with the Vulcans on the deployment of the midas Array . Though we 're still in the testing phase , we think it won 't be long before we can use this technology to send signals at hyper-subspace speeds . A message that would normally take years to reach its destination could be received by Voyager in a matter of days . Impressive . Will they be able to respond ? No , sir , but at least they 'll know we 're still looking for them . We 'll send data on the hyper-subspace technology and hope they can eventually use it to return the call . Excuse me , Admiral Paris . Lieutenant Barclay ... l-l 'm sorry , Commander . It 's just that there may be a way to establish , uh , two-way communication with Voyager . Now is not the time . It 's all right , Mr. Harkins . Let the man speak . I 'm all ears , son . Well , um ... Well , you see , there 's a , uh , a class-B itinerant , uh , pulsar uh , and ... well-well , as you probably know , s-sir , uh , neutrino emissions , uh ... oh . What I mean to say is that with the Array , we could open an artificial uh , uh ... a ... sing ... a sing , uh , sing-singularity . A wormhole ? Yes ! Yes , sir . We could use it as a conduit to-to talk to Voyager . I can 't give you high marks for clarity , Lieutenant , but you 've certainly got my attention . is there any merit to what he 's saying ? Mr. Barclay has a tendency to get ahead of himself , sir . Unfortunately , what he 's suggesting is beyond our abilities . But you haven 't even ... Mr. Barclay ! I know that I haven 't explained myself , uh , very well , but with all due respect , sir , what do we have to lose by trying ? I think we 're forgetting that there are 150 people stranded in the Delta Quadrant . I have a son on that ship , Lieutenant . I haven 't forgotten that fact for a single moment . I 'm sorry , sir . l-l didn 't , uh ... I didn 't mean to ... Take the rest of the day off , Reg . But ... That was not a suggestion . How did you deal with your feelings afterwards ? What do you mean ? Well ... did you talk to Commander Harkins after the meeting ... apologize ? Well ... no . I wanted to , uh , fine tune my plan so , l-l just went right back to work . Be more specific . What exactly did you do ? Well , I ... needed someone to , uh ... bounce ideas off of , someone to help focus my thoughts . Sounds reasonable . I suppose you ... consulted with some of your Pathfinder colleagues . Well ... not exactly . You went back to the holodeck , didn 't you ? They 're the only people that I can talk to . They 're not people . I know ... but they ... they help me with my work . Poker , massages ... sleeping in holographic quarters ? Sounds more like escape than work . I can 't concentrate if I 'm not relaxed . Can 't you relax with your friends ? " Friends " ? Commander Harkins invited you to his home . You went to the holodeck instead . It 's not what you 're thinking , Deanna . This isn 't a relapse of my holo-addiction . Okay . Tell me how the holograms helped you with your work . Well , I talked to them about my ideas . I worked out technical problems . I need specifics here , people . Take us through it again , Mr. Barclay , one step at a time . Maybe it 'll spark an idea . We 've got our itinerant pulsar . We 've got our interdimensional transponder array . How do we get our wormhole ? This one could keep us up all night . Oh . We know we can produce gravimetric energy , but ... can we do it at levels high enough to create the singularity ? We 're talking about a massive subspace reaction . Maybe ... that 's the problem . Reg ? Maybe we need to think smaller . You 're losing me . How much bandwidth do we really need ? The average wormhole is huge , but if we compressed the datastream ... We wouldn 't need a conduit anywhere near as big . What 's your idea ? A micro-wormhole . Impressive . You 've outdone yourself this time , Reg . I 'll still need , um ... help with the details . Put together a team . Use whatever resources you need . A power ratio of approximately 60 terawatts should do the trick . You think that 's enough ? Should be , but then , we have to compensate for gravimetric interference . And how do we do that ? I was thinking- - what if we applied a narrowband filter to the transponder signal ? Barclay strikes again . What 's going on here ? Commander ... Who 's your friend , Reg ? Yes , aren 't you going to introduce me ? Computer , delete characters . I thought I told you to go home . I was , uh ... working . You call this work ? You 've created holograms of the Voyager crew . Oh , it-it ... it-it 's not what you think . It 's an interactive , uh , diagnostic program . I designed it to help me ... solve problems . How long have you been in here ? Since the briefing . The briefing ended ten hours ago . I ... I know that I embarrassed you in front of the Admiral and I am ... I 'm sorry . I wanted to refine my idea , so that I could present you with a specific plan , and I 've done that , Pete . You were right about the wormhole idea being too expansive . So , I 've-l 've scaled it back ... All the extra time you 've been putting in- - if I checked the holo-logs , would I find you 've been spending those hours in here ? Well , not-not all that time . How much of it ? Maybe , uh ... 20 or ... 30 hours a week . Don 't you think that 's a little excessive ? Uh , not if it helps us contact Voyager . Before I brought you onto my team ... I reviewed your file . You 've struggled with holo-addiction before . From where l stand , it looks like you 've had a relapse . l-l know it-it may look that way , but ... I think you need counseling . What I need is for you to pay attention to my ideas . I should 've been paying more attention to your behavior . I thought I was being a friend by giving you some leeway . I didn 't realize how ... involved you 've become with Voyager . Well , is it really so wrong ? Do you have any idea what it must be like for them to be stranded 60,000 light-years from home ? Do you have any idea ... how lonely that must be ? I 'm sorry , Reg ... but until you get some help , you 're off the project . You-you can 't do that . You 've given me no choice . This hologrid and the lab are officially off limits . Now , go home . I won 't leave- - not until you 've heard what I have to say . Reg ! Don 't make me call Security . What is it , Nicole ? He 's still here . You told him I have a meeting scheduled at 1500 ? Yes , sir . He won 't go away . Send him in . Yes , sir . Admiral , uh , th-thank , thank you , uh , for seeing me . You 're frightening my secretary , Mr. Barclay . You have five minutes . Five minutes , right ? Sit down . Uh , first ... first , l-l-l want to apologize for speaking out of turn yesterday . l-it 's only because I ... I , I care so much about Voyager . Yes , Commander Harkins has informed me about your attachment to the crew . I understand you 've been spending time with a holographic re-creation of my son , among others . Frankly , I find that rather disturbing . Well , I understand h-how you could see it that way , but , uh , that does not negate the fact that I have a plan for communicating with Voyager . Commander Harkins doesn 't seem to think your plan is viable . I have refined the idea . I 've simplified it . All I 'm asking for is a chance to try . And if I 'm right , it could mean a chance to talk to Tom . In my opinion , Commander Harkins removed you from the project with good cause , and that 's his prerogative . I won 't let my personal feelings interfere with Starfleet procedure . I ... I 've broken protocol and I should be punished , but the crew of the Voyager shouldn 't be and neither ... neither should you . I just need access to the lab for one more day . After that , if I ... uh , if I 'm wrong , I 'll resign my commission . I 'll order a review of your findings . If it 's concluded your ideas are valid , I 'll instruct Commander Harkins to pursue it . But ... I 'm the one who knows ... That 's the best I can do , Mr. Barclay . Good day . So the meeting went well . No , no , no . It didn 't , not at all . The Admiral said he 'd review your findings . Don 't you see ? He was just trying to get rid of me just like Harkins . Try to relax . Now you understand why I need your help . Yes , I do . You-you have to call the Admiral in your official capacity as a Starfleet Counselor and tell him that I am psychologically fit to return to work . I can 't do that . Why not ? ! Look at yourself . You 're experiencing acute anxiety , sleeplessness , paranoia . You did what you could . Now it 's time to let Starfleet worry about Voyager . We need to take care of you . There is nothing wrong with me ! You said yourself , you 've become obsessed with Voyager . What if I have ? If an obsession helps me to do my job better , i-it 's a sacrifice I am willing to make . A little instability in exchange for contact with a stranded starship . Isn 't Voyager more important than my psychological condition ? Voyager is important , but so are you . That ship ... that crew ... they 're all I have . Tell me why that is . Ever ... ever since l-l left the Enterprise , things haven 't ... haven 't been the same . It 's as if ... I lost my family . So you created a new family on the holodeck . Only they 're not real . I didn 't know how else ... how else to cope . Do you remember when you first came aboard the Enterprise ? You had trouble fitting in , didn 't you ? But after a while , you started to make friends . You can learn to do the same thing here on Earth . Oh , I ... I don 't know how . We 'll work on it together . You 're , you 're scheduled to depart tomorrow . I 've decided to ask Captain Picard for a temporary leave of absence ... to spend some time with an old friend . Oh , Deanna , you ... you-you , you don 't , you don 't have to do that . Try and stop me . I 'm sorry , Neelix . I have to leave . No , no , you can 't talk me out of it . Authorization code required . Barclay-alpha-one-seven-gamma . Access denied . That code has been de-authorized . Computer , reenter authorization code Barclay-alpha-one-seven-gamma . Access authorized . Computer , interface with the midas Array . Activate the control matrix . Matrix activated . Full power to the graviton emitters . Emitters powering . Scan the area surrounding the Array for a class-B itinerant pulsar . A pulsar has been detected at coordinates 227 by 41 mark 6 . Good , good . Direct a 60 terawatt tachyon beam toward the pulsar . Tachyon beam initiated . How long until levels are sufficient to produce a gravimetric surge of five million teradynes ? Approximately 17 minutes . Computer , is there a micro-wormhole present at coordinates 343 by 27 ? Scanning . Affirmative . I knew it . Adjust the phase alignment to direct the wormhole 's trajectory to Delta Quadrant , Grid 9 , Sector 417 51 . Trajectory established . Open Starfleet Emergency Channel and transmit toward the singularity . Channel open . Starfleet Command to USS Voyager . Come in , Voyager . Voyager , do you hear me ? This is Lieutenant Reginald Barclay . Step away from the controls . Pete . I ... I 've sent a message . Stand down , Mr. Barclay . All right . You win . Computer ... transfer controls to hologrid program Barclay pi-three and restrict access ! Stop him . Stun him if you have to . Tuvok , did you see those two men ? I did not . Well , they look like Starfleet Security , but they 're not . Intruders ? They 're after me . I need your help . Tuvok to all hands . Intruder alert . Computer , locate any unauthorized personnel aboard Voyager . Two unidentified humans , Deck 4 , Section 8 . Isolate them with force fields . Security to Commander Harkins . We 've been isolated by force fields . Can you shut down the program ? I 'm working on it . Access denied . Hologrid controls have been encrypted . Harkins to Security . I need reinforcements . Computer , redirect the wormhole 's trajectory to Delta Quadrant , Grid 1 1 , Sector 64238 , and retransmit the message . Trajectory established . Transmitting . A wormhole ? What 's going on ? I 'm just trying to help some friends . is there a response ? Negative . Computer , redirect the wormhole 's trajectory . Reg ! You 'll have to come with me , sir . I 'll cover for you . Computer , seal Jefferies Tube Door J53 . Computer , cut all power to the hologrid . Unable to comply . Main power controls have been encrypted . Very clever , Reg . Security to Commander Harkins . We 've lost him , sir . I 've got an idea . I 'm coming in . I know you . You 're Reg 's friend . You 've got something to do with what 's going on here , don 't you ? Computer , disengage primary coolant system . Are you crazy ? That 'll cause a warp core breach ! Exactly . Mr. Barclay , I want an explanation for what 's going on aboard my ship . I 'm looking after Voyager 's best interests , Captain . You 're just going to have to trust me on that . You 've never given me any reason to doubt you before . Computer , redirect the wormhole 's trajectory to Delta Quadrant , Grid 10 , Sector 3658 and retransmit the message . Trajectory established . Transmitting . Who are you trying to contact , Reg ? Warning . Warp core breach in 45 seconds . Bridge to Engineering . Report . Shut down the program , Reg . Janeway to Security . Intruders on the Bridge . Computer , establish a force field around the science station . Warning . Warp core breach in 30 seconds . Harry , get down to Engineering . Seal that breach . Force fields aren 't going to help you , Reg. lt 's over . But this is my last chance . Warp core breach in 20 seconds . Captain to all hands . Abandon ship . Warp core breach in ten seconds . One way or another , this program 's going to end . ... seven , six ... Good-bye , Captain . ... four ... Computer , end program . ... two ... I 'm ready for my lesson . I 've concluded that teaching you to sing is an inefficient use of my time . But I ... I 've ... I 've been practicing . In your case , practice is irrelevant . Your vocal chords are incapable of producing basic diatonic tones , not to mention your rhythmic shortcomings . I sound so good in the sonic shower . Perhaps you should confine your efforts to that location . Astrometrics to the Bridge . Go ahead , Seven . I 've detected what appears to be a micro-wormhole at coordinates 194.6 by 35 . A micro-wormhole ? I believe a message is being transmitted through it ... on a Starfleet Emergency Channel . Let 's hear it , Harry . Starfleet Command to USS Voyager . Try applying a narrowband filter to the signal processor . Do you hear me ? This is Lieutenant Reginald Barclay . That 's it . Whoever this Barclay is , he stopped transmitting . The micro-wormhole is collapsing at a rate of .2 percent per second . That doesn 't give us much time . To do what ? To send a message back through and hope Mr. Barclay is listening . It should have worked . I don 't understand why it didn 't . There you are . I 've reviewed Mr. Barclay 's plan . I think it 's worth an attempt . He 's already tried , sir , without your authorization . It didn 't work . I 'm sorry to hear that . So am I , sir . I appreciate your confidence in me , but I ... I don 't deserve it . What would you like me to do with him , Admiral ? He broke into the lab , accessed the midas Array , resisted arrest . You 've put me in a difficult position , son . I was hoping that we 'd be able to ... We 're receiving a transmission . From where ? Coordinates 343.6 by 27 . The wormhole . Starfleet Command , come in . Voyager . Reg , give me a hand clearing up the signal . Lower the filter band by .3 kilohertz . This is Captain Kathryn Janeway . Do you read me ? I think she 's talking to you . Captain ... this is Lieutenant Reginald Barclay at Starfleet Command . It 's good to hear your voice , Lieutenant . We 've been waiting a long time for this moment . The feeling is mutual . Unfortunately , the micro-wormhole is collapsing . We have only a few moments . Understood . We are transmitting our ship 's logs , crew reports , and navigational records to you now . Acknowledged , and we 're sending you data on some new hyper-subspace technology . We 're hoping , eventually , to use it to keep in regular contact , and we 're including some recommended modifications for your com system . We 'll implement them as soon as possible . Uh , there 's someone else here who would also like to say something . This is Admiral Paris . Hello , sir . How are your people holding up ? Very well . They 're an exemplary crew , your son included . Tell him ... tell him I miss him , and I 'm proud of him . He heard you , Admiral . The wormhole is collapsing . I want you all to know we 're doing everything we can to bring you home . We appreciate it , sir . Keep a docking bay open for us . We hope to ... That 's it . They 're gone . You did it , Reg . I 'm sorry I doubted you . Why the long face , Mr. Barclay ? Because ... because it 's over , sir . No , Lieutenant . I 'd say that Project Voyager is just beginning ... thanks to you . Anyone know this Barclay ? I took the liberty of reviewing his personnel file . He 's had a rather colorful career , not to mention an unusual medical history . He 's recovered from a variety of maladies including transporter phobia and holo-addiction . Well , whatever his problems , he certainly came through for us . Starfleet should give him a promotion . I 've finished analyzing the data Mr. Barclay sent . The hyper-subspace technology is promising . I believe we can look forward to future communications with Earth . Well , that calls for a toast . Care to do the honors , Tom ? To ... my dad . It 's nice to know he 's still there . And to the newest honorary member of the Voyager crew , Reginald Barclay , whoever you are . Hear , hear . To Mr. Barclay . Congratulations . Well , I 'm not ... not sure I deserve congratulations . Why not ? It 's quite an accomplishment . I , I couldn 't have done it without your help . Why did Commander Harkins have to say about it ? Well , I think ... I think he was pleased . Why wouldn 't he be ? You 're quite a catch . Well , not everyone would want his sister-in-law to date someone with my history . It 's a new era . So , tell me all about the lucky lady . I want details . Well , her name is Hope . You 're kidding . No , and-and-and ... she loves cats .

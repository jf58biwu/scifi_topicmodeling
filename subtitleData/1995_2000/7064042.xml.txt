 Come , come ! Please ! Aziz . Aziz . Aziz , light ! Aziz ... light . Good . We start again . " When the three planets are in eclipse ... the black hole , like a door , is open . Evil comes ... spreading terror and chaos . " See the snake , Billy ? The ultimate evil . - Make sure you get the snake . - Yes , I 've got your snakes . I got all the snakes . When is the snake act supposed to occur ? If this is the five ... and this is the one ... every 5,000 years . So , I 've got some time then . You bring them water . Good boy . I 'll take it to them . Go with God . Be safe from evil . You see here these different peoples , or symbols of people ... gathering the four elements of life ... water , fire , earth , air ... around a fifth one . A fifth ... element . Forgive me , Lord . They already know too much . Father . How are you ? - Well . You have some glasses ? - Of course . I 'm so glad to see you . It 's the most extraordinary thing . It 's the greatest find in history . You must be parched . Oh , yes , yes . I 'm sorry . It 's like a battle plan . Here the good . Here the evil . And here , a weapon ... against evil . I 'm going to be famous . Then let us toast to your fame . To fame . Salute . You can 't toast with water . Billy , in my sack , the grappa . This I don 't understand . This could be something ... prehistoric . I don 't know . But , wait . Here . Look , look . They 're here . This man ... this perfect being . I know this is the key . I know it . This divine light they talk about . What is divine light ? Aziz , light ! Much better . Thank you . My Lord . Father , this is the most unbelievable thing I 've ever seen . Don 't you think ? Are you German ? Lord ... I know he was about to discover everything . But , no worry . I was there in time . Priest ... you and those before you ... have served us well . But war is coming . Stones not safe on Earth anymore . This ... is really amazing . The fifth element . Take the stones . My Lord ... if you take the weapon , we 'll be defenseless ... when evil returns . In 300 years ... when evil returns ... so shall we . Oh , Professor . Professor . Don 't move ! I have a gun ! Please , understand . They 're our friends . Friends ? Father , they 've killed the Professor ! They 're monsters ! I 'll explain everything . - You 're with them ? - Look at me . I am your friend . - No , Father . - Billy , look at me ! Please , put ... the gun down . Billy , no ! Hurry ! The wall is closing ! Here is your mission : Pass your knowledge to the next priest ... as it was passed to you . I will do as you command , but ... hurry , you still have time . Time not important . Only life ... important . I will fulfill my mission ! You can count on me ! I will pass the knowledge until your return . Anything yet ? - Not even a temperature ? - The analyzers have jammed . One shows a million degrees , the others minus 5,000 . Let 's see it . It 's taking shape . Send out a probe . Ladies and gentlemen ... the President of the Federated Territories . On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds . I saved this seat for you , Father . President on the line . We 're in position . I have to address the Supreme Council . Just the facts . There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet . All the calibers are overshot . We 're initiating thermonucleatic imaging . What you 're saying is , you don 't know what this is . All we know is , it just keeps getting bigger . Recommendation ? My philosophy is : Shoot first and ask questions later . I don 't like uninvited guests . All right , then . Mr. President ? Priest Vito Cornelius , expert of astrophenomenon . I ... have a different theory to offer you , sir . You have 20 seconds . Imagine that this ... thing is not anything that can be identified ... because it prefers not to be . Wherever there is life ... it brings death ... because it 's evil . Absolute evil . One more reason to shoot first . Evil begets evil , Mr. President . Shooting will only make it stronger . Probe will obtain objective in five seconds . Growth rate is at 27 % . Your theory is interesting , but we don 't have time to go into it . Time is of no importance . Only life is important . You 're right . That 's exactly what we 'll do . We 'll protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens . You may fire when ready . Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile . Marker lights on the objective . Its structure solidified on the surface . I think it 's anticipating the attack . That denotes intelligence . The most ... terrible intelligence imaginable . 120 's loaded . The ship is in combat formation . Missiles are loaded . - Staedert . - Yes , sir . I have a doubt . I don 't , Mr. President . What happened ? Can you hear me ? What happened ? - Did you destroy it ? - I 'm about to . The planet has increased diameter by 200 % . It 's moving toward the ship . What do we have that 's bigger than 240 ? Nothing , sir . Staedert , do you hear me ? Get out of there . I don 't want an incident . Do you hear me ? Get out of there . Can you hear me , Staedert ? Do you understand ? Listen . That 's an order . Do you understand me ? Do you hear me ? Get out of there ! Good God ! Four a day . I 'm tryin ' . To quit is my goal . I 'm up . All right , I 'm up . God . Hey , dog brain , Finger here . Hi , sweetie . I love you too . You haven 't called me that since basic training . I was talking to the cat . I forgot ... you prefer your cat to the real thing . At least the cat comes back . Still pining for that two-timing slut ? There 's millions out there . I don 't want a million . I just want one . The perfect one . It don 't exist , Major . Yeah , I know . What ? Picture of you . - How do I look ? - Like shit . Must be an old picture . Bring me your hack for a six-month overhaul . - Negative . - A.S.A.P. I don 't need one . Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions ? I know how you drive . Finger , I drive a cab now ... not a space fighter . Tell me . How many points you got left on your license ? Major , how many points ? At least 50 . Know what ? You gotta learn to lie better . See you tonight . Welcome to Paradise . Welcome to Fhloston Paradise . It 's Ruby Rhod , and I 'll tell you live at five ... the winner of the super green Gemini Croquette Contest ! The winner will go with me for two days to Fhloston Paradise . Tune in to Radio Cosmos . Don 't watch all day . It 'll rot your brain . For a perfect world . - Give me the cash . - Been here long ? Long enough . Give me the cash . Is that a Z-140 ? Alleviated titanium . Neurocharged assault model . Good thing for me it 's not loaded . It 's not loaded ? You have to ... push that yellow button to load it . Take your time . Want me to ... There you go . Give me the cash ! That 's a very dangerous gun . Maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you . You don 't mind , do you ? You sure ? No . Take it . I don 't need it . That 's a nice hat . You like it ? God ! Please enter your license . Yes , just a minute . Welcome , Mr. Dallas . Good morning . Sleep well ? Me too . I had a horrible nightmare . Propulsion 2-X-4 . You have five points left on your license . Yeah , thank you for reminding me . Have a nice day . Why not ? You have 48 hours . That 's the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions . - And then ? - Then it will be too late . The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power ... but to exterminate life . All forms of life . You 're telling me there 's nothing that can stop this . There is only one thing . The Mondoshawan have in their possession the weapon to defeat evil . Four elements ... gathered around a fifth ... supreme being , the ultimate warrior ... created to protect life . Together they produce " The Light of Creation . " Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe . But , if ... evil stands there ... Then what ? Then light turns to dark . Life to death ... forever . A Mondoshawan spaceship requests permission to enter our territory . Give it permission to enter with our warmest regards . Thank you . Permission to enter granted . Show time . We are lost . Aknot , we are connected to Earth . Mr. Zorg 's office . It 's Aknot . I 'm so glad to hear you , Aknot . The mission is accomplished . You 'll have what you asked for in a few hours . Good . I 'll meet you at my factory . The attack was by two unregistered warships . Close all borders and declare a state of general alert . Try to contact the Mondoshawans . We owe them an explanation . Three hundred years of waiting for nothing . Go get some rest . No . The Mondoshawan ... I am their contact . They will come for me . This is government business . I 'll keep you informed . The rescue team has reported from the crash site . Any survivors ? Only one . You call that a survivor ? A few cells still alive . More than I need . Have you identified it ? The computer went off the charts . Normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups ... which is enough for any species to perpetuate . This has 200,000 memo groups . Sounds like a freak of nature . Yeah , can 't wait to meet him . You okay ? Over here . Excuse me . General , I want to show you something . This is a normal human DNA chain . You , me , anybody , right ? Watch this . The compositional elements of his DNA chain are like ours . There 's simply more of them , with infinite genetic knowledge . Almost like this being was engineered . Is there any danger ? We put it through the cellular hygiene detector . The cell is , for lack of a better word ... perfect . Go ahead . Mr. Perfect better be polite . Otherwise , I turn him into cat food . Activate it . Tissue processing . Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection . This is the last phase . The cells are bombarded by atoms which forces the body to react . That means growing skin . Wonderful . Reconstruction complete . Remove the shield . I told you . Perfect . Thermal bandages . I 'd ... like to take a few pictures ... for the archives . - What 's she saying ? - I don 't know . Activate the phonic detector . Is that thing solid ? - Unbreakable . - Good . If you want out ... you 'll have to develop those communication skills . General alert . Perfect . Ladder on 18 . Two men with me . The rest in the main ventilation . This way . Lady , stay calm . This is the police . There 's nowhere else to go . Slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor . Do you understand ? She doesn 't . I think we need a flying unit . This is the police . This is the police . We are processing your identification . Put your arms up and follow our instructions . She has no file . She dove off . You just had an accident . Yes , I know I just had an accident , you daffy bastard ! You have one point left on your license . Look out ! Left ! I can 't believe it . Shit . Any survivors ? Hi . Are you okay ? Boom . Boom . Yeah , I understand " boom . " Bada boom . Big . Big bada boom . Big ... bada big boom . Big boom . Yeah , big bada boom . Bada boom . Big boom . Big bada boom . You 're lucky you 're not dead . This is a police control . Please keep your hands on the wheel . You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle . We are going to arrest her . Thank you for cooperating . Sorry , honey . Looks like this is your ride . Open the door . Do what they say . Sorry . " Please ... help . " I only have one point left on my license . I need it to get back to the garage and get the cab a six-month overhaul . You understand ? Can you please open the passenger door ? Please ... help . I can 't . I repeat ... open the passenger door . Yeah , yeah , sure . Why not ? Thank you for your cooperation . Help . Finger 's going to kill me . Emergency ! Emergency ! One point has been removed . Yes , I know ! This is so stupid . Assist in pursuit of yellow cab . Unit 47 , we 're on the way ... after we finish lunch . Two golden menus . I 'm too old , too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod . Thank you so much . And I 'm definitely too thirsty . Look out ! We got lucky . If they don 't chase you after a mile , they don 't chase you . Maybe two miles . Hang on . Look , lady ... I only speak English and bad English ! Run an I.D. I 'm all for conversation , but maybe you can just shut up for a minute ! He 's got a scan blocker . Means he 's a car thief . Blast him . I don 't know what you did ... but they are pissed off ! Hold on ! We 're safe for a while . You want to play soft ? I 'll play soft . You want to play hard ? Let 's play hard . If we get to the fog , we 'll be okay . If we make the fog . How do they expect us to find anything in this shit ? We 're just going to wait here until things quiet down if you don 't mind . Shit . You okay ? Priest . You don 't need a priest , just a doctor . Vito Cornelius . What ? Priest . Yes ? I 'm looking for a priest . The weddings are downstairs , my son . Congratulations . She 's not my bride . She 's my fare . She 's looking for Vito Cornelius . The phone book said he lived here . Yes , that 's me , but I don 't know who she is . Nobody does . No file , no I.D. , nothing . She 's got a tattoo on this arm . Tattoo ? Fifth ... element . Finger 's going to kill me . - Hey ! Wake up ! - Who are you ? I brought the girl , remember ? The redhead . She just dropped in on me . Started speaking a bizarre language . It 's not bizarre . It 's the divine language . It 's the ancient language ... spoken throughout the universe before time was time . He 's a she . You noticed that . Yes . - It 's a miracle . - Miracle she 's not dead . Not a moment to lose . Wake her up . But gently , because this woman is ... mankind 's most precious possession . She is perfect . Perfect . More dignified . Hey , lady ... wake up . I shouldn 't have done that . It was wrong to kiss you . He said to wake you gently . You 're right . Just thought you might remember me from the cab . Remember ? " Bada boom ? " " Big bada boom ? " Boom . Big bada boom . In the cab . Look . I drive a cab . This is me . Korben Dallas . Korben . You understand ? Here . Take it . You can call me when you learn English . Just kidding . What is your name ? You . Korben . Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat . Good . All that 's your name ? Do you have ... a shorter name ? Short . Korben Dallas . Leeloo . Leeloo . Korben , Leeloo . Leeloo , Korben . You 're sure she 's a Supreme Being ? Absolutely sure . Old friends . Yeah , you 're right . - Ask her for my gun back . - What 's your name ? Korben Dallas . Thank you for your help . You 've been kind , but now the girl needs to rest . She 's been on a long trip . I know . I was there when she landed . Wait , wait , Father . She said something I didn 't understand . What does " ekto gamat " mean ? " Never without my permission . " That 's what I thought . I shouldn 't have kissed her . Oh , no . I 'm so sorry . I forgot your food . How about some nice Thai food ? Yeah , yeah , hold on . Buddy , I 'm waiting all day here . - Finger . - Where 's the cab ? Car 's running fine . Fine . What " fine " ? I know you . " Fine " ain 't in your vocabulary . You can tell your old buddy Finger what happened . What ? You save the planet ? You dinged the fender again . That 's it , right ? I was on my way to see you , and a fare fell in my lap . One of these big fares you can 't resist . How big ? Five-nine ... blue eyes ... long legs , great skin . You know ? Perfect . I see . And this perfect fare , she got a name ? Leeloo . What 's she doing ? Learning our history , the last 5,000 years that she missed . She 's been asleep for a while . I know she 's been through a lot , but we don 't have much time . You 're right . Chicken . Good . Chicken . I 'm really sorry to interrupt you , but ... the case ... with the stones ... where is it ? Stolen ? Who in God 's name would do such a thing ? Excuse me , sir . The council is worried about the economy heating up . Is it possible to fire 500,000 ? I thought from a smaller company , like one of the cab companies . Fire one million . But 500,000 ... One million . Fine , sir . Sorry to have disturbed you . It 's for the Supreme ... Sorry . I didn 't know your size , and I found you this makeup box . You just put it like that . Yes , there was a man with a limp ... came here a month ago asking about the stones . Said he was an art dealer . What was his name ? I 'm bad with names . - They really make her ... - Perfect , I know . What 'd she say ? She says she knows exactly where they are . My dear Aknot , how about those two planes you borrowed ? Aknot , is that you ? What an ugly face . It doesn 't suit you . Take it off . That 's better . Never be ashamed of who you are . You 're warriors . Be proud . So what if the federal government scattered you to the wind . What doesn 't kill you makes you stronger . Your time for revenge is at hand . The ZF-1 . It 's light . The handle 's adjustable for easy carrying . Breaks down into four parts , undetectable by X-ray . Discreet . A word on fire power : Titanium recharger , 3,000-round clip , with bursts of 3 to 300 . With the replay button , a Zorg invention , it 's even easier . One shot ... and replay sends every following shot to the same location . And to finish the job , all the Zorg oldies but goldies . Rocket launcher . Arrow launcher ... with exploding or poisonous heads . Very practical . Net launcher . The flamethrower . My favorite . And for the grand finale ... the new Ice Cube System . Four full crates ... delivered right on time . And what about you , dear Aknot ? Did you bring what I asked ? Yes . Magnificent . This ... This case is empty . Empty ? Empty ... the opposite of full . This case is supposed to be full ! Anyone care to explain ? The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust . Who took another route . She 's supposed to contact this person ... in a hotel . And she 's looking for the address . Easy . Dot . It 's Planet Fhloston , in the Angel Constellation . We 're saved . I 'm screwed . You asked for a case . We brought one . A case with four stones in it ! Not one or two or three , but four ! Four stones ! But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case ? We are warriors , not merchants . But you can still count ! Look at my fingers . Four stones , four crates . Zero stones , zero crates ! Pack everything up ! We 're out of here ! We risked our lives . I believe a little compensation is in order . So you are merchants after all . Leave him one crate for the cause . I don 't like warriors . Narrow-minded , no subtlety ... and they fight for hopeless causes , honor . Honor 's killed millions of people . Hasn 't saved a single one . I 'll tell you what I do like : A killer . A dyed-in-the-wool killer , cold-blooded , clean and methodical . A real killer picking up the ZF-1 ... would 've asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun . Bring me the priest . I got everything we need to know about Fhloston Paradise ... and a blueprint of the hotel . Good work , my son . Now to find a way there . It won 't be easy . There 's a charity ball tomorrow . Flights are full , and the hotel will be guarded . There must be a way . I 'll get it . Weddings ? Not really . - Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you . - Who ? Mr. Zorg . Jean-Baptiste ... Emmanuel ... Zorg . It 's nice to see you again , Father . I remember you now . The so-called art dealer . I 'm glad you got your memory back . Because you 'll need it . Where are the stones ? I don 't know . If I did , I wouldn 't tell someone like you . Why ? What 's wrong with me ? I try to serve life . But you only ... want to destroy it . Father ... you 're so wrong . Let me explain . Life , which you so nobly serve , comes from destruction and chaos . Take this empty glass . Here it is , peaceful ... boring . But if it is ... destroyed . Look at all these little things . So busy now . Notice how each is useful . What a lovely ballet ensues ... so full of form and color . Now think of all those people that created them . Technicians , engineers . People who can feed their children tonight ... so those children can grow up and have children ... and so on . Thus adding to the great chain ... of life . Water . Fruit . You see , Father , by creating a little destruction ... I 'm encouraging life . In reality , you and I are in the same business . Cheers . Where 's the robot to pat you on the back ? Or the engineer ? Or their children , maybe ? There , you see how all your so-called power counts for nothing ? How your entire empire of destruction comes ... crashing down ... all because of one , little ... cherry . You saved my life ... and in return , I 'll spare yours ... for now . You 're a monster , Zorg . I know . Torture who you have to , the President , I don 't care . Just bring me the stones . You have one hour . It 's gobbling up all the satellites in the galaxy . Why is it eating up all the satellites ? We 're working on it . The Mondoshawan deplore the incident but accept our apologies . And the stones ? Did you find them ? They weren 't on board . What ? The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race . They gave them to someone they do trust . Her name is Plavalaguna . She 's a diva . She 's singing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise . She has the stones . The Mondoshawans will help . We must send someone ... to get the stones . Excellent . I want this operation to be as discreet as possible . No troops . No big operation . I want your best man to go undercover . I have the perfect one . You 've got a message . Not opening it ? Could be important . Like the last two were important . First one was from my wife telling me she 's leaving . The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife . That is bad luck . Grandfather say ... " It never rain everyday . " This is good news , guaranteed . I bet you lunch . Okay . Come on . " You are fired . " Oh , I 'm sorry . At least I won lunch . Good philosophy . See good in bad . I like . - Hello . - Korben , sweetheart . You got broken fingers ? You can 't punch my number ? Hi , Mom . Seventeen messages . Don 't say your machine is broken again . They last 1,000 years . Mr. Kim , you should go . This 'll take a minute . You don 't feed your cat a croquette , who you love more than me . She didn 't breast-feed you . I did . Good fortune for you . You don 't have a girl . I 'll never be a grandmother . It bring you good luck ! My body 's failing . Take me on this trip . What are you talking about ? You want to make me beg ? No , all I want is an explanation . I just got in . I just smashed my cab . I lost my job . I got mugged . Besides that , everything 's peachy . Thanks for asking . Now settle down and explain this to me . You don 't know you won a trip ... to Fhloston Paradise for two for ten days ? I suppose you 'll just leave me on the lunar surface ? If I 'd won a trip , I 'd know . I would 've been notified . They 've been blaring your name out on the radio for an hour . I 'll call you back . General , how nice to see you in the 5000 block . Nice apartment . You 've settled into a wonderful life . Heard you lost your job . You heard that ? Don 't worry . I 'll get another job . Don 't bother . We have one for you . " Major Dallas ... you 've been selected for a mission . " - What mission ? - To save the world . " You leave for Fhloston Paradise . Get four stones from the diva Plavalaguna and bring them back . " Any questions ? Why me ? I retired six months ago . Remember ? Three reasons . One : As a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit ... you are an expert in the use of all necessary weapons and spacecraft . Two : You 're the most highly decorated member of your unit . The third ?

Old tricks are the best tricks . Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife . I am not going . Why not ? Excuse me , General . Who is it ? Who is it ? My wife . You remarried ? Yes ... no . I just met this girl , but I 'm going to marry her . I love her , but she hates the military . She knows the military ruined my last marriage . She can 't have anything to do with it . If she sees you , she 'll kill me . - Major ... - You gotta hide somewhere . You 've gotta help me . We 'd love to , but where can we hide ? We don 't have time for this . It 's just for one minute . You have no idea how much you 're helping me . No idea ... You have no idea . - I 'm going to be happily married . - Major ! Major ! - The three of us won 't fit . - Sure you will . Major ! You 're on my foot . Major ! Major ! I 'm really sorry to resort to this , Mr. Wallace ... Dallas . We heard about your good luck and need your tickets for Fhloston . Is this the way priests vacation ? We 're on a mission . What kind ? We have to save the world , my son . You 're gonna save the world ? Yes ! Down there . Down there . This is a police control . This is not an exercise . Come on , get in . For one minute , all right ? Just stay here for one minute . - This is a police control . - Don 't touch anything . This is not an exercise . Can you please spread your legs ... and place your hands in the yellow circles . - What are you doing ? - Saving you so you can save the world . Yeah , but I ... I think this is the door . No name , no number . Let 's see it . Are you classified as human ? Negative . I am a meat Popsicle . I found him . Mr. Korben Dallas ? Sir , can you put your hands in the yellow circles , please ? Smoke you ! Wrong answer . The police control is now terminated . Thank you for your cooperation . Have a nice day . We got the guy . Wasn 't easy but we bagged him . - Thanks for the tip . - Glad to be of help , my friend . The guy 's been arrested for uranium smuggling . All I have to do now is go to the airport , take his place ... and I 'll be in Fhloston in four hours . Don 't come back without the stones . We got Korben Dallas . Perfect . Akanit , take command . Go to Fhloston and get the stones . If Zorg really wants them ... he 'll have to negotiate . Revenge is at hand . Oh , I am so sorry . I forgot about the autowash . There 's an autowash in that shower . I 'm so sorry . Autowash . Autowash , yes . Autowash , in the shower . It 's funny . I 've met you twice today . Both times you 've ended up in my arms . It 's my lucky day . Lucky day . Did you hear something ? Cornelius . Autowash . - I 'm so sorry . - I don 't need your help . - Want a cup of coffee ? - Yes , please . Autowash . Coffee 's not my specialty . But you must drink a lot of coffee being a priest . I know . I 'm not proud of what I did . I had no choice . I 'll take the mission . - Did you get them ? - Yeah . Good . - " Leeloo Dallas . " - " Multi-pass . " " Korben David Dallas . " Perfect . I can 't be your husband . I 'm too old . Now David is ... in great shape . He 'll protect you .

You got it figured out , Father ? This one should be fire . - You know how this works ? - Theoretically . The four stones should go around .

But if you don 't do something right now ... we 'll all die . What 's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it ? It 'll enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds . You 're right . You 're right . There are some things ... very nice things worth saving ; beautiful things . Beautiful things . Like love ? Yes , love . That 's good . That 's good . That 's a good example . Love is worth saving . I don 't know love . I don 't know love . I was built to protect , not love . So there 's no use for me other than this . You 're wrong . You 're wrong . You 're wrong . I need you . I need you , very much . Why ? Because ... because ... Tell her , Korben . Tell me . Please . Why you need me ? Because ... Tell me . - Tell me . - Because I ... Because I love you .

Where are my two heroes ? They were so tired from their ordeal , we put them in the reactor . I have 19 meetings after this . Let me see if they 're revived . Thank you . We go live in one minute . They 're ... not ready . They need ... five more minutes . You have 20 seconds . No , ma 'am , I tried . No , ma 'am . Who 's that ? Some woman . Claims to be Korben 's mother . Give it here . Mrs. Dallas , this is the President . On behalf of the Federation ... That doesn 't even sound like him . The President 's an idiot . You don 't sound like an idiot . If you don 't want to talk to your mother ... just avoid me as usual .

The arabian Nights / as a boy , I was fascinated by the tales of The arabian Nights . I dreamed of living in that exotic era . Then one day I thought : why dream ? Why not make my dreams a reality ? It was easy : the decor , the atmosphere , a fewtricks ... This for example : rubbing it rings a bell in the cellar . My genie pops us through a trap door . a theatrical trick , - but very effective . - Very . Then I began to think of the commercial possibilities . Creating other people 's dreams to order . and so Q.Q.F. was born . Here , you can stand beside Nelson at Trafalgar , flight with General Custer , become Gengis Khan or a Roman emperor , heavyweight champion , or ruler of the world . a million dreams made to order . Fantasies created with a few simple tricks such as you 've already seen . Don 't worry , old man , better luck next time . Now , Mr. Reed , your fantasy ? Might I suggest an intrepid trapper , or a calvary man at Balakalava riding into the valley of death ? I thought perhaps ... Got it. a secret agent . Ideal for you . License to kill , pitting your wits against evil . Make a change from your everyday humdrum . - Certainly . - What 's your idea ? Same as Ronny Wescott . He is a client of yours ? Mr. Wescott ... He was here , but I haven 't heard from him since . Unavoidably detained . But I 'll have what he ordered . I wouldn 't think ... You did create his fantasy ? I 'm working on it . But for you ... Oh , no , no , no ! If it 's good enough for Ronny ... Very well , I 'll let you know when it 's arranged . Fine . What is it to be ? - His fantasy . - Chief eunuch in a harem . Colonel ? Steed here . Mrs. Peel called you about the body ? She did . Will you have it moved ? It 's very untidy . You already have ? Hold on , Colonel . I 'm sorry . It 's another body entirely ! Yes , a different one . I 'm not responsible for what happens when I 'm away . No , I 'm not trying to corner the market . Besides ... Sorry , the body was too big to sweep under the rug . No way to identify him , but I saw him earlier today at the honey shop . I 'll explain later . Must buzz back to Bumble 's . Message ends . Mr. Bumble ... Mr. Bumble ! Well ? What has happened to Bernie ? He should be back . - He ought ... - He should ! You should have attended to it yourself ! We shall give him one hour . Then we must presume the worst . at the Q.Q.F. ? You 're due there soon , aren 't you ? Hurry up , my dear Vincent . Don 't miss your 3rd fantasy . I 've given you a general outline of the service I offer . What can I add ? My readers would be interested in specifiic cases . This interest from the press is most gratifying . Specifiic cases ... My most ambitious fantasy to date was sinking the Titanic . Several people had to be resuscitated . Hannibal crossing the alps , an assassination ... - Riding a Derby winner . - an assassination ? I 've had several . Diffiicult to set up . How do you go about it ? First , we allowthe client to select his victim . a real person , a VIP , or a businessman . Then we provide him with this , and get him in a position to use it . We allow him to get his victim in ... - his sights , and then ... - Then ? He has a photographed memory . a camera gun . Get it out of the system - and nobody 's hurt . - I see . Tell me more about your clients ... - Clients ? - Vincent East , is he a client ? I 'm afraid I 'm unable to discuss individuals . Ethics of my business . - But surely ... - I insist . - Thank you anyway . - Not at all . If you ever wish to join the Q.Q.F. for a fantasy ... No , thank you , I haven 't yet exhausted reality . Pity . Hello . M. Vincent ! Ready for your 3rd fantasy ? In a nice murderous mood ? Telephone . Q.Q.F. ? May I speak to Mr. East ? Vincent . Bad news . Bernie has not returned . I know ! You 'll have to kill Hopkirk . - Know what ... - What ? - We 're getting nowhere . - There is the honey . Why would Reed have sent it ? Because ... I don 't know . Reed and Wescott weren 't killed for a jar of honey . - There 's Q.Q.F. - " Quite , Quite Fantastic . " a dead end too . So what was Ronny doing there ? - I understand the harem bit but ... - Harem ? That was the fantasy he 'd ordered . Harem . Bumble said something about the Barabian Embassy . He made a delivery . Barabian Embassy , harem , two agents killed ... Snap ! Hopkirk sometimes dreams up assassinations . Let 's rehearse it . I am the crown Prince ali . You , his murderer , are concealed say ... here . I 'm enjoying a quiet smoke . You have not revealed yourself yet . The surprise is yet to come . Hold your gun at the ready . Your gun , Vincent ! Nowthen ... you 'll choose your moment well ... and pop up ! No ... You 're not into it ! You won 't get any satisfaction unless you put something into it . Think ! Think murderously ! Your expression , your attitude is too bland , unconvincing . You wouldn 't frighten a fly ! Get a fiirm grip on your gun . Higher . Point it at me . Here . No , that 's not very good . You must concentrate . Fix me with your eye and think : " I am going to kill him . " " I am going to kill him ! " Much better ! Much more ... realistic . Fantastic ... Quite , Quite Fantastic .

If we do just what 's written , you 'll be able to enter the embassy and our task is over . Hopkirk knows his business . Knew his business . as you say , my dear Vincent ... as you say ... Why don 't you just tell the prince he 's in danger ? Impossible . You know why he 's here ? To sign over oil concessions . In return for full military protection . Well ? How can we protect his country if we can 't even protect him ? One man in our own country ? What weapon will the assassin use ? Gun , knife , rope ... Poison ? The honey ... it must be important . You 'd have to be within tasting distance ... The prince won 't leave the embassy once he 's arrived . The killer has to smuggled in , or be there . But he has to be in the embassy . and so do I. I pray pardon for this intrusion . What is it , Grand Vizir ? an British effendi , o gracious one ! He begs admission to your illustrious presence . Is he to be trusted ? His credentials have been checked once , twice and thrice , o mighty one . He has been searched for offensive weapons . I , who am a mere speck on the camel 's back , a poor , lowly toad in your most all-seeing eyes , - think he can be trusted . - Bid him enter . at once , pearl of all wisdom , with all speed .

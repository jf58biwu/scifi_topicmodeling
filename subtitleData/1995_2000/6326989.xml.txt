What are these pictures ? I do not know exactly . I have not seen yet . Did he say where he did ? The e-mail said anything about a place called North Harbor forest . There is a military base near the forest . Could be a helicopter . I might . I wonder where to begin storm . Thundered throughout the afternoon . Strange , because the forecast said nothing of the storm . Hi . Who are you ? - Is the man they called . - I 'm Dave Brikman from Paranoid Times . Oh , yes , yes . I 'll show you some pictures in the darkroom . They are incredible . - Sheldon ? - Later on . - I really need to talk . - Not now , right ? - Excuse the mess . - Nothing , Mr. Lamott . Tell me , Sheldon . Here they are . That 's all you have ? I have not had time to focus . It happened pretty quickly . From what I understand , there is a military base in the area . It is possible to ... There was nothing like what I 've seen military . It was a great thing very bright spherical . I do not know what it was . Where to go ? Well ... I was there about 30 seconds and then disappeared . - What were you doing in the woods ? - What was I doing ? In mail you said that you are one of ordinary hunting UFOs .

When the children went to school . Things have changed . We removed . Still love it . I just do not know what to do . Sheldon , I 'll be straight with you . That does not prove anything . But it was a UFO . I know what I saw . It 's hard to convince people with real evidence . We would need at least one more witness . No , please . Do not talk to my wife . Not until you talk to her . Tell you what . Put this on Paranoid Times and see if anyone responds . Thank you ! - The photos prove a thing . - What ? - We are in an episode of Melrose Place . - What do you mean ? - What do you mean ? - No matter , Eddie . Some pictures are unnecessary . It means that other stuff that I found unrelated ? What stuff ? Maryline Waters Power , had an unexplained power failure . An inexplicable weather report came from Barkeville . Eddie ? Alo ? Alo ! Awesome ! Do you need help ? - Dan Moody . - Good . Dave Brikman . You 've come to Sheldon ? The guy who had a grade 3 meeting . Yes . Unfortunately it was not for grade 3 . Sheldon has a vivid imagination . I drove 400km to get here and now this damn car will not start . - What is it ? E battery ? - I do not think . I 'm not sure . I was the driver in the Navy for almost 20 years . - Can I have a look ? - Just please . The injector may be clogged . Maybe it 's something in the computer that I use cars today . - I bring tools . - Brikman ? Come here . Moody now . Something 's happening on TV . I do not know what is . I repeat . Today at 4 : 30 pm Eastern Time , the Pentagon made an official announcement , an alien army that attacked Earth . At least nine major capitals of the world , were destroyed by air strikes . The death toll is estimated at almost 19 million . God ! - That does not happen . - Yes . ... And now heads to the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia . The Pentagon has asked us to keep public order . We urge you not to leave their homes and do not panic . We will keep still ... The second wave . If it 's broken , Dan can fix . There 's nothing broken . I do not see why not start . Machines , telephones , current ... all are down . They are to blame aliens . Sure they did something . What do we do ? We must arm ourselves . We are preparing for battle . Here we are in the army , Moody . We are in a suburb . Glad you decided to wave the white flag . - But do not speak of teaching . - That 's right . No surrender . Not an option . You 're the expert . What do you think ? In the last 5 months I knew the existence of aliens on Earth . And it paved the way for the invasion . I talked myself , but I could not make people listen . - And now I 'm here . - You really saw aliens ? I saw , I fought with them and I know that if we are united we can win . - Yes ... and how it looks ? Little green men ? - They are just like us . - Cultivate human genetic duplicate . - Clone ? - Come on , I think you 're kidding . - I wish I kidding . - This man is crazy . - Believe it or not , Moody 's right . We should arm ourselves and make our supplies . And to find a secure bunker . The power lies in the large number . We must find shelter . A basement ... You can use it on our own , but do not know if it 's big enough . You can use my house . The foundation is strengthened . I do not hustle in the basement anyone . Clear ? - Okay . Then stay out . - Boyd , Boyd will not leave anyone out . Better go to me . It is ten times better than ... - It would be better to go inside . - Go inside . Come in . - I wish I 'd been and children here . - You think you can do it now , Pauline . We are at the mercy of God . Where are the boys ? Dan and Rikman are at home , let 's bring some things . Where is Boyd ? Not here with me lest they die . - That 's all you got ? - I handed weapons when I retired . - These are good at something ? - Not much . We need to find something here to go barricade . Where have you been ? Home . I took a flashlight and radio batteries . I suppose you have no weapon . They dentist , Dale , right ? - Dale , help me please with water ? - Yes . Let 's go down , people . Move . - You 're crazy to stay here . - What other choice do we have ? We 're sitting ducks in that basement . One more shot and we 're dead . Vii ? I see nothing . We have water , food , medical kit , batteries ... Six people . - We can get 6 days . - Try to catch the news . The atmosphere is overloaded . It is getting closer . I think we should pray . God , the Bible speaks of the Day of Judgment . Perhaps that day has come , but if you have to accept anger , have mercy on us . What 's that ? How do I know ? - That was an alien transmission . - Oh , spare me ! - It could be a transmission noise . - No , you did not hear ? It was alien . How do you copy your radio transmissions alien , Boyd ? Why do not you go back to your affairs and leave me alone ? Hey , you said that aliens look like us . Da . And how do we know that any of us is alien ? Well , I do not know . Where do you want to fight , Sheldon ? If you ask me , it 's an alien in this room right now . And his name is Boyd . Finally you have realized , Sheldon eh ? You received an alien transmission . - You 're so smug . - What about all those business trips ? - What kind of dentist do so many trips ? - Why do not you shut up ? Why ? Expect your aliens to tell you something ? It can give you orders . Calm down . No time . You can not make such accusations . Incidentally , I know one thing ... he saw that UFO in the forest . - Why do not you say what you saw ? - Stop . - Why do not you confess ? - Sheldon , shut up . Because it 's an alien . Therefore . Does Not . Because I was your wife , old retarded . - What you gonna do about it ? - Gentlemen , please ! This is no time to lose control . Who the hell you think you are , you tell us what to do ? - Boyd , do not be an asshole ... - Fuck you ! Boyd , we are neighbors for 10 years . I like you . Do not make me break into pieces . - You chose Sheldon me ? - You think I 'm an alien ? No I do not think so . I 'm tired of these stories . - Okay , Sheldon ... - Enough ! Just listen . Listen . Help ! Please , help ! Help me ! Who 's there ? Give in your name . - Maybe one of them . - Where are ready . Do not let anyone in . - We can not ignore it . - Yes , we can . - It could be one of the neighbors . - Alice is right . Let 's open the door . Supplies are limited . Even if one of the neighbors , we can not afford to receive . Once Boyd has the right . - We can not leave them out . - Why not ? We take precautions . We cover the door ... I do not know . I do not know who he is and want to risk my life ? Absolutely not . It can be a human being dies there . You have a conscience ? Dale , should help those out . Let me go , please ! - It 's about our safety , Alice . - Dale , can be hurt . Look what it is . The rules have changed since I came down here . There is no place for charity . - Dale ? - We go us . - It 's a Christian thing , Boyd . - Yes , and so to be crucified . All right , you open the door . - I go out first . - I 'll cover you . Yes , I got it . Watch the stairs . Easy . Lay it on the table . Put it on the side . Come on . Watch your head . I had . Who the hell is ? Jonathan Tran . E photographer . He came to my house to take pictures . - And you wanted to leave it there . - How was I to know ? - Boyd , examine it . - I 'm a dentist , for God . Still have medical training . Do not worry . Slowly . E exhausted , but otherwise I think it 's good . - Where are they ? - It 's okay , you 're among friends . - Water . Water , please . - Give him some water . - Slowly . - OK done . We do not have even that . Mr. Tran ? Can you tell us what you saw there ? Everything was destroyed . It 's awful . Where are you from ? In addition to Washington ... Suddenly I saw all those ships flying in the sky like locusts . There 's nothing left in Washington ? Washington DC is gone . They descended on the highway we were high and we melted cars . I saw women and children burning . God help us ! How did you get here ? I ran . I left my car and ran into the woods . We all ran . I do not know how much . Then I saw a sign that directed me here . It was the only place that I could not think . - We can not stay here . - Sheldon , please ! How did you know to come here ? What do you mean ? How you found us in the basement ? I had to go to Hackett . I went there , but I heard shouting . I could not run and I came here . It 's okay . You 're lucky you found us . Yes , you are lucky . It 'll be great . You could picture the house at sunset . The sun shines right through the windows . Fill up all the room in a light golden yellow . Here you go . It has no sugar . It 's okay . Thank you . - I 'm scared , Dale . - I. I believe that God has crooked ways . - The purpose ... - What for ? How can a merciful God to let it end this way ? Here . We can not always understand the work . I know . Maybe we gave a fuck . I mean look around . Greed , lies , dishonesty , deceit . Even here in our backyard . In our neighborhood . Maybe I gave the bar . Maybe give us a chance to save succeeding . And we turn against each other . I love you . I love you . I think it would come to this ? They 'd come down here . I tried to alert the people in the past 5 months . All governments , security agencies , I set up a web page . Nobody wanted to believe . Or to believe now . Anyway , I think it 's a lost cause . Have you heard Tran . Or destroy everything . Do not believe it . If you remember , then it 's a good actor . The highway is 20 km away . Think ran both ? - Perhaps because of adrenaline . - 20 km ? And he ran straight to our door . Move towards Hackett . I do not trust people like him . What , like him ? Do you know . That kind of people . - No I do not know . - I can not be trusted . It 's a pretty big generalization . Do not you think so ? I have had experience with people like him . People like he had in the barracks in Southeast Asia . - Do not turn your back any minute , man . - Yes , but then was war . And what the hell do you think this is ? - How are you ? - I 'm fine . You know , Pauline ? It 's not too late . For what ? Forgiveness . That 's what all marriages . Sheldon to forgive me and I forgive him Sheldon ? Dale and I have been married for 15 years . It was one minute without the ups and downs . - That 's all marriage . - That 's what I mean . You know Alice , my goal in this marriage were children . When they go to school , that goal was extinguished . Sheldon has his work is his hobby . - I feel like I have nothing . - Stop . Not true . Boyd threw me a rope , and I hanging . Yes , but at what cost ? Time is running out . Why not try ? - It takes too long to make a picture . - What ? Your husband went out . Sheld ? I thought you left . Does Not . I 'm so sorry , Sheld . I 'm very sorry . Of all men , why Boyd fucking arrogant ? Boyd made me feel desired . Your priority has always been to work . Not me . How do I pay for all this ? Let me assure family . What 's all this , if we have not been together . Can not going to survive the night . But if our last night , can you try to forgive me . Does Not . That 's better . Sheldon ? What the hell was that about ? I made a big mistake . I had to finish this last night . What happened to you ? Newsflash showed me who you really are . Really ? And who the hell are they ? A selfish arrogant . You know , Pauline ? I 'll get over that ... It 's over . Tran ? - You say you ran through the forest . - That 's right . How much ? - I do not know . It seemed an eternity . - See ? That bothers me . Because if you come from the highway , the only road through the forest was Huckson Park . That 's only 800 meters . - I do not know . - Why do not you admit you 're lying ? - Dale ! You have no proof . - Leave me to take care of that . - I 'll tell the truth . - I say . - Who are you ? - I told you . - Are you an alien ? - Hey , hey Moody . Leave it . Leave it . I 'll tell you who is alien . Yes , here is an alien . - I was too stupid to realize . - You blame me now ? Does Not . Not you , Sheldon . - Pauline . - It 's despicable , even for you , Boyd . - What ? - This is ridiculous . It sounds crazy . But I sat and I thought . - Enough to reach some conclusions . - Keep your findings to you . - E Pauline , and I 'm sure . - He 's mad that I said it 's over . Damn I 'm angry ! Sheldon was not lying when he said he saw UFO in Colombia , a few days ago . And Pauline knows because she was there with me . We parked on Route 12 . She chose the place and she insisted to go there . - Boyd , stop . - No time to play theater . Try to contact . Tell them that 's not true , Sheld . Sheldon , tell them . Motherfucker ! I can not stay here . Pauline ! Pauline , it 's okay . God ! Sheldon ! Open the hatch ... Let us go ! Wait , Moody . It 's an alien ship there . - Open the door . - I 'll let Pauline there ? What do you care , Sheldon ? Did you already a mess . Open the door , Boyd ! I 'm out and want to kill us . If you open the door , we are all in danger . Get out of my way . I never asked Paulina to come out , right ? So , what 's done is done . - You have to think about our safety . - And to abandon ? - Why ? - Because I want to live . As far as I 'm concerned , those people are already dead . - Get out of my way Boyd . - You 'll regret this , Moody . We 've left out . What kind of people are you ? Pauline ! Relax ! My neighbors . I thought you know , but it 's not . You 're all animals . Moody What happened to you ? We 're going to shoot ? I came to open the door . It took a lot of time . - I do not know what 's there . I could not ... - To open the door ? ! Let me guess . I had to vote , to discuss ? If we let them live or die ? You should think . It was an easy choice . Sorry . He wanted to let you go . I wanted . Boyd , refused . I mean , I could not be sure ... Sorry . Sorry I hesitated . Sure . - I tried to convince him , but ... - Fuck you , Sheldon . - Boyd will not let go . - You 're a liar . - Do not lie ... - Shut both , until you kick your ass . It 's an attack ship right above us . No time . Your governments have capitulated to us . Do not resist or be eliminated . Peaceful surrender will ensure survival . Do not do bad . Any resistance will be attacked with biological weapons of mass destruction . We must teach . - What the hell you know . - We will not surrender . - And what do you suggest we do ? - Fight . What weapons ? We have a damn gun . If we teach , maybe we 'll survive . If we do not fight we will not have a life . We will be slaves ... We have no chance if you fight them . - We must stand on the barricades . - Let 's stay on the barricades ... we will slaughter . So be it . At least not die in vain . We show that we are willing to fight . I agree with Brikman . Yes , you two GI Joe do what the hell you want . I say to negotiate , to make a deal . We can not negotiate . There will conclude any agreement . - How the hell do you know ? - Because we do not negotiate with you . And what do you suggest we do ? Let 's get out there with much fanfare ? We only have a gun . And then what ? I propose to wait to try to get out and escape . Does Not . I say we teach . Wait ... - Wait ... What ? Only Boyd wants to surrender . What you talking about , Sheldon ? Do not you see ? Boyd 's classic ... Why do not you say that 's your real plan , Boyd ? This plan ? I never realized you were talking about before . I heard Tran , making a deal with Boyd . He works for them . What ? For aliens ? - Yes . - Wait a minute . You 're a fucking liar . - Sheldon , who said Tran ? - Stay calm , Moody . Tran told Boyd that he made a deal with aliens in exchange for protection . - So , so you escaped . - Mind , I have not made any agreement . They seek care among people who help them . You mean you need traitors . - No traitor . - You know , Sheldon ? You 're dead . Wait , that we have only the word of Sheldon . Want proof ? How do you think the aliens found this house so fast ? How do you think he escaped Tran ? Why do not you let Boyd , to enter ? - All this is ridiculous . - Sheldon , I think you 're lying . - I 'm just saying what I heard . - You 're lying because you hate Boyd . So what ? That 's what I heard . Jur . You 're a damned liar . We are doomed since I left Tran to enter . We are doomed since I left Boyd in . Okay . All right ? I made a deal . But Sheldon mind ! Stay there . - Boyd ? - Stay there . - Put the gun down . - Stay there , or murder . Put the gun down . - I did nothing . - Boyd , please . This was not supposed to happen . You shot me . He made his move . He came here . He came here . He made his move . All right . Do not worry . They said that the bullets are blanks . Who said ? People who rely on me . - Who are you talking about ? - About aliens . Those who have called for selection on Elm Street . We paid 400 dollars a day . They said that you are the competitors . That must be a game . I 'm just an actor . It 's just a game . Dale , what happens ? God , it 's over . What happens ? It was a test . It was a test , you bastards . It was a test . It was a test ! Other reports of invasion ? In addition to blackout in 5 states , nothing . But in neighborhoods ? A man reported that he saw UFO ? I went into the municipal system . There are two complaints made to noise but no UFO report . Sorry Cade . That alien ship , could be anything . Helicopter hologram lot . I thought it was over , Eddie . Too little , too late . As hard work for nothing . The second wave has not yet come , my friend . You still have time . I saw police and paramedics arrived home from Lamott , after you left . Take Tran 's body , I guess . So , aliens have done everything , holotech ? It 's incredible , man . You know what bothers me the most ? That learned exactly what had to know . There was no alien that night , Rivington Street . No Hackett Boyd nor Lamott , even poor John Tran . The aliens were defeated us with a number of false transmissions and some special effects . And the crucial battle , we revealed the most dangerous secret . We are our own worst enemy . I think you should see this . That 's the guy who shot John Tran ? Yes . He is . He shot John Tran .

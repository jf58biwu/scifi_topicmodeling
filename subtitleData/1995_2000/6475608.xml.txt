 Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi It 's just a damn passport photo ; it 's not the cover of Vogue . There 's no reason I have to look like hell in it , is there ? Now , settle down . We 're on a schedule here . I know we 're on a schedule here . Act natural . I 'll be back in ten . Make it five . I 'll be around back . Relax , Billy . Lower it just a bit . Yeah . That 's it . Good . Yeah . Big smile . Yeah . Hold it . Big trip you got planned ? Oh , you know . Nothing special . Just good to have a passport . Looks like it 's clearing up . Might be a nice day , after all . It 's just going to take a few minutes . That comes to 6.95 . Oh , great . I left my money in the car . I 'll be back . I 'll be here . Ow ! Hey , you jerk ! What ... ? Billy ... Billy , someone did something to me . Billy ? Shoot . My God . What are your thoughts on that , Scully ? Have the local police been contacted by this woman 's abductor ? No demand for ransom ? No , unfortunately . It 's going on three days . Any additional leads ? No . No hair and fiber evidence , either . The rain washed it all away . The autopsy did come back on the dead boyfriend , though . It 's a puncture wound through the left eardrum and into the brain- - possibly from a long needle or awl . I 'm still not sure how you and I figure into this investigation . Well , did you see the photo ? Yeah , I assume that was taken by whoever it was who abducted her . It was taken by a 65-year-old druggist moments before she was abducted . That 's a passport photo from a local drugstore . The druggist who took that photo is the last known person to have seen Mary Lefante . Only , he claims that wasn 't the photo he was taking . He says the photo he was taking was normal in every respect . He only came forward to the police when he heard the woman was missing . Well , whoever it was who took this photo was obviously privy to the woman 's abduction . That is what you would think . The damnedest thing . Here it is , just like I left it . It was under lock and key . Is that where you keep it ? Yes . Mind if I take a look ? Please , help yourself . At first , I thought I did something wrong when I took the picture . You see , there 's that piece of paper you have to pull off . You have to do that just right . I 'm sure you did it just fine . Your film 's out of date . Is that against the law ? No . I was just making an observation . I don 't get much call for passport photos , you know . The copy shop over at the mall does them cheaper . Oh , excuse me . I sure hope you find that young woman safe and sound . So , which one of us gets to use the stun gun on Bruno Hauptmann back there ? All right , so he doesn 't exactly stand out as a suspect . Mulder , take a look at this . You see this smeariness here ? I 'm thinking that it 's heat damage . With the , uh , the heater sitting under the film right there , the emulsion probably melted . So you think that would make it look like she posed screaming for a passport photo ? - Plus , the film is two years out of date . - Oh . The photographic chemistry could have changed . - Uh-huh . - The dyes ... fade . They ... All right , so what 's your theory ? I 'm not sure I have a theory . Excuse me . You the two FBI agents ? Yeah , Agents Mulder and Scully . Well , sorry we brought you all the way from Washington . Afraid we might have wasted your time . Hey , Trott . Inspector Puett , these are Agents Scully and Mulder . Agent . " Inspector ? " United States Postal Inspector . My office is investigating a mail theft- - one which we 've traced to your missing person , Ms. Mary Louise Lefante . She was a postal employee . She works as a sorter at the Kurland Hills branch . Not coincidentally , a number of unsigned credit cards in transit through that branch never made it to their respective owners . Mary Lefante was intercepting them ? And her recently deceased boyfriend was signing them . We ran him . He was into forgery , check fraud , you name it . Mary Lefante 's passport photo- - do you know how soon she wanted to leave town ? Did she know about your investigation ? Probably . Though we didn 't focus on her specifically until this week after she came up missing . And you think that she faked her own disappearance . Well , looks that way to me . Yeah , but why would she stab her boyfriend through the ear ? The magic was gone ? Did you find a camera anywhere here ? So you 're thinking this woman planted that photo of herself in the drugstore ? What would be the point of that ? I ... Here it is . Stand back , Scully . It 's loaded . What are you doing ? In the ' 60s , a bellhop named Ted Serios became kind of famous for taking what he called " thoughtographs . " He claimed that by concentrating on an unexposed film negative , he could create a photographic representation of what he saw in his mind . He did landscapes , cathedrals , the queen of England . " Thoughtographs . " Yeah , also known as " skotographs . " The literature on thought photography dates back almost to Louis Daguerre . So that makes it legitimate ? Look at that . Oh , my God . I think he was here , Scully . Who was here ? Mary Lefante 's abductor . I think he stalked her . He could have come up right here . I think he came in here and he looked at her through the window , this close . Close enough to affect the film in that camera . Psychic photography . Mulder , I think that it 's obvious that somebody doctored these images and planted them to be found here . Maybe it 's some kind of a smokescreen . Meant to conceal what ? This isn 't about mail fraud , Scully . That 's just incidental . What if ... what if someone had this ability ? An image like this would be a peek into that person 's mind . Into their darkest fantasies . The fantasy of a killer . Hey , miss . She 's completely nonresponsive . We did a preliminary tox screen on her- - found traces of morphine and scopolamine . Twilight sleep . The dental anesthetic ? It 's basically a painkiller cocktail . It 's also for women in labor . Would that account for her condition ? No , it wouldn 't . What would ? Give her a P.E.T. scan . All set . Oh , my God . What is it ? She 's been given what 's called a transorbital lobotomy . It used to be known as an ice pick lobotomy . It involves inserting a leucotome through the eye sockets . So we 're looking for a doctor ? Someone with training ? Not judging by this . Whoever did this , Mulder , did it wrong . Un ... Unru ... Unruhe ... Unruhe ... Mary . Un ... Unruhe ... We better go in there and get her . Unruhe . Unruhe . Unruhe . We just got the call . There 's been a second abduction . Unruhe ... Unruhe . Hab keine angst . Ich verde dir helfen . Vers deine unruhe bau vergessen . Deine unruhe vergessen . All right , Terry , you can roll ; we 're set here . Right . Get that area taped off . Watch it there . Excuse me , ma 'am . Mulder . Charles Selchik , certified public accountant . Dead from a stab wound through the ear . Cleaning crew found the body . What about the missing woman ? It 's his secretary , Alice Brandt , age 32 . Family confirms that she was working late last night . What 's her connection to the first victim ? Apparently none . But if the M.O. remains the same ... Yeah . The clock is running . Yeah . I keep thinking about that word that Mary Lefante was repeating : " unruhe . " I checked the Michigan phone directory . It appears under three different spellings , none within 80 miles of here . It might be significant as a word . That 's what I 've been thinking . Apparently , in German , it means " trouble " or " strife . " " Unrest . " You took German in high school , Scully ? College . Unrest , huh ? I 'm working on these crime scene photos from the first abduction . If we 're lucky , we 're dealing with someone who gets a vicarious thrill from returning to the scene of a crime . He wasn 't there , Scully . How do you know ? It would 've affected the photos . Trott , what did you find ? Nothing much . There 's no cameras or film here whatsoever . It 's all just accountants ' offices , so I don 't know why there would be . Is that what we 're looking for here , Mulder- - more evidence of psychic photography ? That may be the only evidence we get . I 've got a Bureau forensics team coming up from Detroit . What 's here for them to find ? This guy is obviously very good at what he does . He 's left behind no witnesses , no latent prints . The only thing he 's left are those photos , which leads me to believe he doesn 't even know he has that ability . We haven 't found any new psychic photos here either . Wait a second . I want to show you something . Right here . This . And look . It 's the same company . What if the kidnapper was working construction at both sites ? From these two vantage points , he would have been able - to pick out the two women . - You may be right , Scully . You should check it out , let me know what you find . Where are you going to be ? I 'm going to be back in D.C. I want Special Photo to run this . I still think the answer 's in here . What if it 's not , Mulder ? This woman 's time is running out . Well , that 's all the more reason to fully investigate the one and only hard piece of evidence we do have . I 'll be in touch . Das ist fur dich . Es ist fur dasht da zeggertraggen hot . Ooh ! Oh , get away from me ! Get away from me , you bastard ! - Shh . - Let me go ! Shh , shh , shh-shh - shh-shh-shh-shh . Bald ... Sehr ... sehr bald . Can you get rid of the blurriness surrounding her here ? Yeah . Just need to mark a place where the blur comes to a point , then let the computer do its business . Bingo . Lord , look at that . This guy 's an artist . Why do you say that ? However he did this ... however he put this together ... it 's seamless . What about this face here ? Can you bring that up at all ? Mm . Wait a sec . Let 's try ... I think I could - sweeten it more . - Okay . Do that . What have you got ? We 're running the construction company employees . 18 workers overlapped on both job sites . We 're checking their records now , but so far , nothing . What about day laborers ? Mr. Iskendarian there says that his company doesn 't hire workers off the books . I don 't want any trouble with the I.R.S. But that his foreman might hire a little cash-only day labor without his knowledge . He 's got seven job-sites going now ; as many foremen . Gather officers to canvass . Which foreman was working the Midlothian Corporate Park ? That job 's finished . Find out where he is today . I 'll take that one . Can I use your phone ? Okay . Thank you . NCIC shows no match for that man . What about this shape up here ? What is that ? Can you take that and flip it so that that 's on the bottom ? Is that a shadow ? Yep . It is . Somebody 's shadow . It 's the kidnapper 's shadow . It 's like ... it 's like he 's looming over her . It 's like he 's standing over her . He means to pass judgment on her like a god . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hi . Can I help you ? Uh , I hope so . Are you the foreman ? Yes , ma 'am . Gerry Schnauz . I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully . I 'd like to ask you some questions about the , uh , the day laborers that you hire . Well , is this some I.R.S. thing , or ... ? No , sir . Not at all . Well , my crew 's at lunch if you want to talk to anybody , but everybody I 've got on today is on the books , as far as I know . Excuse me . Sorry . Yeah . Sure . Scully . Scully , I may have something for you on the kidnapper . It 's , uh ... something about his legs . Yeah ? They 're unusually long . They 're out of proportion . I 'm thinking he 's either very tall or he 's not , but wants to be . Scully ? Scully , you there ? Unruhe . Stand where you are . Don 't move ! Stop or I 'll shoot ! Link your fingers behind your head . Do it ! Who ? Alice Brandt . The second woman that you abducted . That 's her name , Gerry . Where is Alice Brandt ? I don 't ... I have no earthly idea what you 're talking about . Tell us where she is , Gerry . I 'm sorry . This is a case of mistaken identity or something . I honestly ... honestly have no idea what you 're talking about . Explain this . We 're running sheetrock today . I use that to start the holes in the sheetrock , to keyhole in all the fixtures . No , you used this to kill the two men . What two men ? You used this on Mary Lefante . Who ? Wait , a minute ago , it was Alice Brandt ... I don 't believe this . I do not believe this is happening . You want to tell us about the first time you were arrested , Gerry . In 1980 , you attacked your father with an axe handle . You beat him so severely that he spent the remainder of his life in a wheelchair . I was not jailed , I was institutionalized . I had a kind of chemical imbalance . Yeah , Gerald Thomas Schnauz diagnosed and treated for a paranoid schizophrenic disorder . Six years in Melvoin Psychiatric Hospital . Released 1986 . So what you been up to since 1986 , Gerry ? Taking care of my father . Looking after him 24 hours a day ... making amends . He , uh , passed away January . Well , how did you feel about that ? Sad . Says here you have a sister . Where is your sister , Gerry ? She passed . Actually , it says here she committed suicide in 1980 . God , that was a bad year . What else happened in 1980 , Gerry ? Well , John Lennon got shot . Where the hell are you going with this ? What are you , Sigmund Freud ? Why don 't you cut the B.S. Then why don 't we get back to Alice Brandt . Where is she ? You look troubled . Hey , Gerry ... This your father ? Where 'd you get that ? You left that for me . You left it like a fingerprint . Is this what you see when you close your eyes , Gerry ? Is that what you see ? Gerry ... tell me where Alice Brandt is . She 's safe ... from the howlers . She 's all right now . Gerry ... tell me how I can find her . Over here ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! Right up ahead . You know , Scully , that word " unruhe " - - " unrest " - - it 's bothering me . Maybe he thought he was curing them somehow . Saving them from damnation . From those things in the pictures- - you know , he called them " the howlers . " It 's over , Mulder . Well , then that photo wouldn 't be his fantasy , it would be his nightmare . What the hell does it matter ? Because I want to know . I don 't . Okay , Gerry ... put it all in here- - wallet , jewelry , everything . Eyes straight ahead . Step over to the table . What the hell ... ? Mulder ... This wound 's in the wrong place . He was shot in the throat . He wasn 't trying to save this victim . They just got a report of a strong-arm robbery . It 's at the drugstore where the first victim disappeared . What happened ? Thank you . It was Gerry . He took the passport camera and all the film in the store . He also took morphine , scopolamine , hydrobromide and insulin syringes . He 's making more twilight sleep . He wants to continue his work . You know that job site that I arrested him at , Mulder , what if he 's ... what if he 's already picked out his next victim ? There were ... there were apartment buildings on all sides . You think you interrupted his stalking ? Let 's go . Hold on a second . Here , you bring the car around . I just want to wait for this . I 'll be right there . Corning . Corning , send units to the 300 block of Belmont Avenue . Check all of the apartments in the vicinity of that job site . I think he 's heading back there . - You got it . - Thanks . Ow ! Scully ! Scully ! Scully ! Sir ? Agent Scully 's Explorer just turned up . It 's abandoned at a park and ride about 20 miles up the U.S. 81 . Any sightings ? A report of an Audi stolen from the same lot . He 's switching cars . He 's going to do that two or three times . Looks like six fingers here . Sir ? It 's got six fingers . What about his apartment ? We got a unit at his boardinghouse , but he ain 't coming back . What about friends , relatives , coworkers ? Does he have a summer house , a winter house ? Doesn 't seem to have much of anything . We 're running a couple of phone numbers we found in his wallet , but so far ... Let me see his wallet . It 's his father 's obituary . " Recipient of the Bronze Star Medal during the Korean War ... Gerald Schnauz , Sr. , D.D.S. " He 's a retired dentist . What about there ? He was here . Why would he take the chair ? Let me go . Shh . Es ist alles in ordnung ... It 's over , Gerry . Let me go right now . Ich werde dir helfen . Do vers deine unruhe hal ferguson . Yes , you do . Everybody does . But especially you . Why ? Why me , Gerry ? Do I remind you of your sister ? Why did your sister kill herself , Gerry ? What did your father do to her ? He didn 't do anything . It was the howlers . Okay . Then let 's talk about the howlers . They live inside your head . They make you do things and say things that you don 't mean , and all your good thoughts can 't wish them away . You need help . You 've got them ... right there . Don 't you feel them ? I don 't have them , Gerry . See ? They made you say that just now , because they know I 'm going to kill them . What if you 're wrong , Gerry ? What if there are no such things as howlers ? What if you made them up inside your head to explain the things your sister said your father did ? Great . Now they got you talking like Sigmund Freud . I am onto you ! I know your tricks ! Besides , I 've seen them , in that picture that your partner showed me . Pictures don 't lie . You saw them , too . If there are such things as howlers , Gerry ... they live only inside your head . Six fingers , right ? We got state police ... Why are there six ? ! What ? We got the state police looking as far south as Grand Rapids . Still no sign . One , two , three ... Agent Mulder ... Damn it . ... what do we do ? One , two , three ... That 's five headstones . And the father makes six . Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Fan out . Check the tree line . Wh-What ... what does this mean ? It means you need help , Gerry . No . I think what it means is that I don 't have much time left . No , Gerry , stop ! Shh . Scully ! Mulder ! I 'm in here ! Mulder ! Help ! Mulder ! Scully ! Are you hurt ? Get an ambulance ! Addendum to case report . After his death , a diary was found among Gerald Schnauz 's belongings . Written in the second person and apparently intended as an open letter to his father , it includes the names of his victims- - the women he desired to " save . " My name is contained in the last entry . I have no further explanation for the existence of the photographs , nor am I confident one is forthcoming . My captivity forced me to understand and even empathize with Gerry Schnauz . My survival depended on it . I see now the value of such insight . For truly to pursue monsters , we must understand them . We must venture into their minds . Only , in doing so ... do we risk letting them venture into ours ? I made this !

Jarod said a man you have lunch with tomorrow will be able to help . What man ? Where ? Jarod said you know . You would never know where the Chuck 's Lobster House , would you ? All the women never know the exact motives of the person who stalked Kimberly Green , I 've identified several character traits which all stalkers exist by getting into the stalker 's head becoming a stalker First of all most stalkers will believe the victim belongs to him , and him alone . and attempting to control the victim 's life through fear . by controlling victim 's actions with fear . And manipulate her ability to interact with other people . A fear achieved by ... avoiding face-to-face competitions . It 's what the victim can 't see . That 's the most terrified . And , what may have happened in the case of Kimberly Green the victim rejects the stalker 's ... attemps to control her life . The stalker 's no longer in control . And can turn to else . Zoe , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . We 're done . Thank you . I 've been on this issue before but never think it is like this . - What you call it again ? - A simulation . I needed to get inside the head of someone who 's doing some pretty horrific things . You did a great job , thank you . Oh one question . Why did you walk up to that police man ? The strange officer catches the stalker for me That 's a little out there . I 've started to feel kind of weird you know . Oh I 'm sorry to get too weird . I didn 't mean to scare you . Yeah , well . I saw the cop and I figured it was talk to you to feel a little nervous . What I don 't usually remember my dreams but this ... ridiculous one was ... uh ... I ... I was sitting in some kind of bar , and ... was walking around , whenever . And ... I was trying to flirt with the bar tender ... who was a woman . All this time we 're talking saying some ... really clever things . And , you know , I , I dream clever . And then , she turns around . And it 's Miss Parker . And now , I 'm , I 'm really turned on and She reaches out and grabs me and poses me across the bar and starts ... me on my brother . Sorry interrupt your session . A session ? We 're not having a session . But I 'm trying to get a beat on Miss Parker . - Have either of you seen her ? - No . Not since lunch . Oh , no , ah , actually I think she said something about pursuing a lead on Jarod . Really ? Yep . Lunch in Maine ? Need trick . Never call me when she returns , From lunch . How did he know about our sessions ? You think you 're the part of the planter ? Sydney ? Wow ! Sorry ! I haven 't seen you . You have a good eye , not being a photographer ? Kind ... kind of hobby . It 's ... it 's honest . You captured her . If the rest of these are like this , you should do the shooting work . I couldn 't do that , never . What 's wrong ? Cindy . I found this on my ... He 's up to me now . Why ? Because he needs new target . I want you to move in with me . I 'll hire private 24 hours security guard .

He 's up to one of your sister 's friends , Cindy Thomas . Come in . It 's not more difficult for missing family . Kimberly wasn 't the stalker 's only victim . I lost the only family I ever had . When was this taken ? One of the fast homes we were in . We had a strange childhood that I didn 't understand . Oh ... I might . We growed up in the system , went from one fast home to another . You never knew what kind of situation you were walking into . But in my word , Kimberly would never let anyone hurt us . Yes . Look , this is the fourth time I told you people I am not switching .

Courtesy of Jarod , I think I have finally reached the end of my rope . Afraid , am I that . I haven 't seen this in years . Was it yours ? No . It was your mother 's . Jarod stayed with me a few month ago . It started to make sense by now . What is ? It was pre-occupation with your mother . And , this ... . He told me the next time you and I met , to give it to you . I don 't know why but , I have been carrying it with me everywhere . She is a dancer in there . I am afraid it doesn 't work without the other figurine . I am sorry I don 't know where it is . I thought this was lost . But Jarod found it ... in an antique along with other items belong to your mother . She bought it one day when we were togther . It always reminded me of her delicated beauty , her graceful dancer skate . My mother was a dancer ? A great one . She never told you ? I am learning that there are a lot of things she never told me . But it is a ... lesson I took as child . Do you still dance ? No I stop ... She stopped too . After she met your father . Ben , do you know where my father is ? He is missing . And Jarod led me here and hoped that I would find him . I 'm sorry . I don 't know about your father . Only your mother . So , It 's gonna been taken any time ? You know that it wasn 't . Erika I know you speaks to your sister every night at ten thirty . I am not the stalker .

No one could understand that . I do . I told you , Jarod . You are safe here . They are not watching you . This is the only camera in the office . I took it down this morning . Remember , it 's only a special favor to you . I have to put it back in a few minutes . So we can talk ? Just you and me ? You can do anything you like . What is it , Jarod ? There 's something in the clock . Right here in the middle . You said they were not watching . Jarod , believe me I didn 't know . You said I would be safe here , you promised . Jarod . Damn you . After he attacked , making my death was my way out . Out of one trap into another . It 's ... living nightmare just happen now . What is it about ? Always the same thing . His eyes . The night he attacked , I felt his eyes on me all day long . As I approached my building , I turned . And he was standing there , wearing a ski-mask , hiding his face , and he tried to put acid on mine . The only thing I registered was eyes . Tell me about it . They were cold , had no feeling . Was there any place that you felt safe ? Home . And the Agency . But you know at the end I thought I was being watched even there . I think I was just being paranoea . I don 't think so . The public doesn 't know who Cindy Thomas is . But the stalker does . You think he 's access to the Agency ? I don 't know . But I need your help to find out . I need you to help me find those eyes . No , Jarod . It 's the only way out of this trap . Trust me . Together we will win . The relationship between your mother and I last almost fifteen years before she died . I can still see her beautiful vision walking out the ... on the sunny day of April . I was on the ladder when she called to me . Her ... broken down . And she tried to fix it herself . Yes , she was covered in oil . So did you help her with crack ? She helped me to the doctor , I .. lost the ladder . That 's all she was , always helping others . Even when she was in need . Is that .. spring you two fell in love ? That 's was the spring we became friends . That 's what we were for many years . She would come up to the end of every April , spend the first two weeks . and that for thoses weeks of joy . It may sound cony but this is simple thing she loved . Gathering flowers on by the lake , Watching the stars . Catherine had a non-quenchable zest for life . A sparkle , until , She met my father ? Oh , at first she seemed happy , but , year after year they sparkle faded . But she kept coming to see you . I was an oasis , the life she was trapped in . She never told me about that life , only her feelings . I swear she was for me . It was many years before our lips touched . But I truely believe that we were met spend our lives each other . We can only have what we had . I hate , to know that she was so sad . She was until you came along . After you were born the sparkle returned . You gave her the strength to remember who she was . She was making big changes in her life . Then she was gone . God I miss her . I do too . Don 't be sad . She was never sad when she talked about you . That is all she really ever wanted to talk about . What 's the other figurine that went in here ? Another dancer , a little girl . Shame they can 't dance together any more . What are you ... doing here ? Your work . It 's excellent . I can 't believe you never show this to anybody . I told you I couldn 't do that . Toby you have a gift . It 's like the camera speaks for you . These are ... beautiful people . I am ... not ... not one of them . Beauty is more than appearance . It 's also about real emotion . I looked your photographs especially the eyes of your subjects , and I see a lot of that emotion . What do you want ? Toby took these ? Everyone who was at the shoot . Anything ? No . Maybe wasn 't there . Maybe he changes his habits . Stalkers always hunt their prey in the same way over and over again . Who was there ? What 's this ? Who 's figure behind the back drop ? Oh , my God . Brian . Too ... , no ... Oh , please , send this one to ... maybe you need new hand model . Ah , this is just give me for you , Brian . - Mr . Faxon , .. is going on the conference now . - Oh , lovely . Kimberly . Hello Brian . Kimberly . Kimberly . Kimberly . Hey . What 's your problem ? My name is Zoe . Oh ... I am sorry I thought you ... What ? Hey ! Who 's there ? You are trapped , Brian . Now how is it feel ? - Over here , Biran . - Kimberly . - This way , Brian . - Cindy . You can 't see us . But we can see you . Now we have all the power . Who are you ? I am you , Brian . I am weak . I am a coward . I hide in shadows and watch . Because creating fear and others is the only way that I have strength . What do you want ? Are you feeling trapped ? Vulnerable ? Terrified ? Just like Kimberly and Cindy felt . Are you afraid I am going to hurt you ? The worst part is you don 't know how . And you don 't know when . Then again that 's what stalking is all about , isn 't it ? Admit it , Biran . They rejected you and that just tore you up inside . I just wanted to be with them . You want control . And when you couldn 't have your way with Kimberly , you stalked her . And trapped her , and you tried to destroy her . With acid . Then you stalked Cindy in the very same way . I just want Kimberly and Cindy to be mine . Oh , well . Now , you are mine . Ah ... . Will you relax , Brian ? It 's just CO2 and water . What 's the matter , Brian ? Look like you 're seeing the ghost . I thought you , I thought you were ... No . I am not . I am not afraid any more either . Relax . Let your portfolio speak for yourself . Don 't worry . Darrin 's going to love you . I ... I 've never thought this day would come for me . No matter what happens , I ... thank you , Jarod . I count that . What ? Pretty , isn 't it ? Pretty ? The music . How is usual Jarod there is no music at the end of your games . Oh , well . I am very sorry that you didn 't have a nice trip . But you have everything you need to find what you 're looking for . Why did you give me this , Jarod ? Oh Let just say : happy birthday , Miss Parker . My birthday isn 't until January third . That 's the point . She would come up to the end of every April . May , June , July , August , September , October , November , December I have been looking all over for that . Daddy ? How are you doing , Angel ? You poach him from my office ? You 've been gone for over a month . Where have you been ? If I told you , I couldn 't protect you . Come along . Mr. Lyle and Mr. Raines want to meet with us . But Daddy ..

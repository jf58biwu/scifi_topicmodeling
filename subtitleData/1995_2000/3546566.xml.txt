" ( OWL HOOTING ) ( DOG BARKING ) ( GROANING ) ( DOG COLLAR CLINKING ) ( DOG GROWLING ) ( SHUDDERING ) There now . It 's Done . ( SIGHING ) richard , I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry ... Now , Don 't worry . The Dogs have him now . He can 't hurt you . good Sophie . good KingsIey . always faithful . The Dogs Do love us , Don 't they , no matter what pact we 've made with the devil ? Of course , darling . animals Don 't understand these things . - Oh , god ! Oh , god ! - Come on . - Do you have it ? - Yes , I have it . Just one last wish , to make things right again . No . No more wishes . But I can outwit it this time . I know what to Do . How can you believe such a thing after what we 've seen ? This abomination raised a dead thing from its grave in answer to your wish ! I can send it away again with my final wish , if you 'II allow me just to hold it . No . No . The third wish must go unused . It 's the only way . ( DOG BARKING ) MRS. WILDER : Sophie ? No ! ( WHISPERING ) I did it , richard . You 'II see . I made a wish that this paw would be owned by someone who really deserved it . We 're free of the curse now ! But Don 't you see ? For the paw to belong to someone else , we would have to ... ( MRS. WILDER GASPING ) You have your wish at last , my darling . We are free of the curse forever . What are those ? They 're for halloween . We 're a house of curios , not a costume shop . DeIores , at this rate , we 'II soon be paupers , and no amount of Father 's magic is going to change that . If we 're going to survive , we 're going to have to expand our client base . Never . I will not have nasty little children in this shop , dressed up like Iggy OswaID , biting the heads off rubber bats . - Ozzy OswaID . - Oh , Iggy OsbaID . Whomever . I will not have them mocking the Dark arts . would more than likely cause Father to roll over in his grave . - Sorry , Father . - That would be novel . hello ? hello ? Can you hear me ? If you 're thinking of coming back from the dead anytime soon , ( BELL JINGLING ) would you please let us know ? - ' Cause we could use the space . - hello ? - help , MarIise , will you ... - anybody home ? ... before she breaks something ? Sorry ! Oh , help her yourself . She 's more fond of you anyway . Of course she is . With an attitude like yours , it 's a wonder you have any human relationships at all . LaVONNE : well , at Ieast ... At least I 'm not in my 30s and still single . You know , there 's a very good reason why no man will have you , and it has absolutely nothing to Do with that ugly hammertoe of yours . It 's because you 're boring , boring as Buckingham palace . Funny , but I swear I remember asking for help . Of course , you did , darling , but your sister and I were just Discussing business . - Or the lack thereof . - Oh , yes , well , business is slow . terribly slow . Maybe it 's time we reconsidered our options . No . I will not sell Mr. Finger 's House of Curios . I promised Father . Times change and people must change , too . Let 's not forget that basil and I still have grandmother Oakfist to feed . The money would be very helpful . I won 't sell . I can 't . She 's terribly selfish . I DiDn 't understand why Father left her in charge . I knew we should have contested the will . I hate you ! Yeah , well , I hate you even more . In fact , I Detest the actual Day that you were born , you wretched little mistake . Has it ever occurred to you that one more prophylactic to a box and it would have been just the two of us ? You liar ! That 's not true ! Look ! It 's a sign . Three wishes ? DeIores , Don 't be Daft . basil , are you going to join us ? In a moment , darling . The ham smells delicious . It 's lamb , you twit . Lamb , you say ? Interesting . Carry on . I 'II just be a minute . As I was saying , that whole monkey paw business is just an old story . Something Father told us as children . It 's more than that , LaVonne . It was in a book . Yes , thank you , MarIise . Your literary insight is awe-inspiring as always . But as most people know , stories Do come from books . Not always . Sometimes they come from newspapers . Stop your quibbling . It Doesn 't matter where the story came from . What matters is that the story is true . LaVONNE : Right . What if ? How Do we even know this is the paw ? MarIise , did you check with the people you purchased it from ? I told you , it was an estate sale . The couple was deceased . Beware the paw . It 's cursed . ( GRANDMA OAKFIST BURPING ) More meat . More meat . A simple " please " would have sufficed . Do you see what I have to put up with around here ? Do you ? It 's ridiculous . What about a magazine ? On occasion , stories are found in magazines , too . Thank you , basil . Have you taken your medicine ? good . Then feel free to continue embarrassing yourself as much as you Iike . LaVonne , listen to me . I believe what MarIise said this morning is true . - Father Doesn 't want us to sell the store . - How Do you know that ? Because he sent us a helping hand from beyond the grave . DELORES : " Three wishes I give , and no more , " to each owner of me , so keep score . " Each wish will come true , " so take care what you Do ... " - blast ! I can 't make out the rest . - Let me . Something illegible ... " greed I deplore . " It 's not very friendly sounding , is it ? - grandmother gone to sleep ? - Yes . Even basil . What a shame . Are you sure you know what you 're Doing ? If I remember the story correctly , those wishes had a way of taking a nasty turn . Then we 'II just have to be smarter than the people in that book . They were greedy . Right . We 'II start smaller . We 'II be a bit more careful . MARLISE : We won 't wish for any more than we really need . DELORES : exactly . I wish for a million pounds . A million pounds ? We 're as good as dead ! - You said start small . - That 's not small . Yes , it is , in the scheme of things . Don 't forget that I have unlimited power here . I could have easily asked for 100 million or even a billion pounds . Not that it really matters 'cause nothing happened . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) hello ? Yes . Yes , she 's here . ( BASIL SNORING ) certainly . How many ? Right . Just a moment please . I Don 't want it . I 'm afraid . Oh , shut up , you bloody parrot . It 's Father 's lawyer . hello ? What is it ? - LaVONNE : One of Father 's shipments ... - Yes , Mr. curd . ... was just delivered to his lawyer by a representative of the post office . apparently it was lost in the system for over 40 years . What was in the shipment ? according to the paperwork , three fountain pens . Yes . Fountain pens ? Yes . waterford Snakes . only four exist in the entire world . We now own three . At £ 250,000 apiece . - How much ? - £ 750,000 ! Do you know what this means ? The paw works ! Except that you wished for a million . Doesn 't that seem odd ? Oh , what the hell ? We 're rich ! We 're rich ! LaVONNE : Yes , we are . Or should I say she is ? Whatever Do you mean ? As the owner of the House of Curios , the pens legally belong to her . Oh , but she 'II share with her sisters . Won 't she ? ( GIGGLING ) Don 't let her out of your sight . I still can 't believe it . Three quarters of a million pounds , and it 's all mine . To be shared with the two of you , of course . well , I for one won 't believe any of this until the pens are safely in our vault . Oh , never Doubt the power of the spirit world . If Father wants us to succeed , we will . I 'II be in the shop . Get back as soon as you 've acquired the pens . Perhaps it would be better if I put the pens in my safety Deposit box at the First national . Safety Deposit box ? - When ... When ... - Since daddy died . It was all part of the will . I thought you knew . - No , we DiDn 't know . - Why DiDn 't you tell us ? I thought I did . Oh , well , I guess I DiDn 't think it was that important . Don 't you worry , sweetie . Those pens are as good as ours . What Do you mean , there are no pens ? On the phone you said there were three pens ! Three pens worth £ 250,000 each ! Yes , well , I 'm sorry . But as you can see for yourself , there was a misprint on the shipping ... What am I supposed to Do with 33 waterway snakes ? I 'm warning you , MarIise , stop this nonsense right now ! MarIise , are you listening to me ? Again , my condolences , Ms. Finger . But as I mentioned before , I Do have a Dinner engagement . Mr. curd , I Don 't care if you 're having Dinner with the Queen in your underwear . If you Don 't take your hands off me right now , I promise you I will personally introduce all 33 of these snakes up your large and rather unflattering arse . - Out ! - Oh , stop it ! - Stop that bIubbering , you spoiled brat ! - Don 't ! Leave her ! ( RINGING ) Where are the two of you ? Car accident ? Are they both dead ? ( DOOR OPENING ) Is ... Is MarIise dead ? The Doctor said she probably DiDn 't feel a thing . We were fighting on the way home . She wouldn 't stop crying . Don 't . Can I see her ? No . The car , it went up like an inferno . At least you were thrown free . - She wouldn 't stop crying . - Stop . It gets worse . Do you remember the safety Deposit box ? - She had an insurance policy . - No ! Oh , it 's all my fault . It was worth a million pounds . exactly what I 'D wished for . The monkey 's paw . Destroy it . Destroy it ! Promise me ! I Don 't know if I can . ( DOOR OPENING ) read it again if you have to . You can 't Do it . I can . I can beat the paw . I can bring MarIise back . No , you can 't . That 's exactly what they tried to Do in the book . She wishes her son back to life , but he comes to the Door as he is now , a rotting corpse . Oh , I can ! I can beat the paw ! DeIores , MarIise is gone . Don 't Do any more Damage . Give me the paw . Oh , no , I 've still got two wishes left . Two wishes left ! No , Doctor , it 's not healthy . She thinks it has magical powers . It 's simply a stuffed paw , nothing more . DELORES : LaVonne ! LaVonne ! Right . well , we 'II see you tomorrow then . Yes . Thank you . What is it ? I know what the second wish should be . Oh , why DiDn 't I think of it before ? Give that to me . ( DOLORES GRUNTING ) - I wish ... - Don 't ! ... that MarIise was the way she was right before the accident . ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) No . No . Answer the bloody phone . hello ? Thank you . We 'II be right there . That was the funeral home . They said they needed to see us right away . I can 't Do it . I can 't go Down there . Fine . I 'II go by myself . You never cared for her . She was your sister , and you hated her ! As I told your sister , it 's very strange , Ms. Finger . Very strange ... She 's alive , isn 't she ? No . Not quite that strange , but strange enough . Look . - I Don 't understand . - frankly , neither Do I. The police told me your sister Drove her car off the road . Yes , the car went up in flames . She was horribly disfigured , burned . Ms. Finger , your sister 's car DiDn 't catch on fire . She Drove it into the lake . She did ? Yes , but something very odd is going on here . Somehow the police Detectives missed this . Just before your sister crashed her car , somebody put a bullet in her head . Your sister was murdered . murderer ! As I believe you once said , " Times change and people Do , too . " MarIise told you about the insurance policy as you left Father 's lawyer , and you killed her . That 's right . and I would have got away with it , too , if it haDn 't been for that ridiculous paw . No , you had to try and bring the little brat back . You had all the money you could ever need . But , no , you had to fuck with history . You 're mad . No , I 'm not . I 'm justified . You DiDn 't marry basil . You DiDn 't change grandma Oakfist 's nappies every night . I did . I paid my Dues . and now I want out , and you 're not going to stop me . Give me that bloody paw , DeIores . I Don 't want you using that last wish against me . You Don 't have to worry , LaVonne . I 've already used it . - You what ? - Oh , I 'm not as Daft as you think . I gave my wish away . I wished that the Iast wish belonged to my sister . You 're pathetic . I Don 't want your wish . In fact , I wish that you had your wish back . There . That 's Done it . No , it 's not , because I DiDn 't tell the paw which sister to give it to . I beat it at its own ridiculous game . That twisted paw gave the wish to MarIise . ( SHUDDERING ) ( MOANING ) ( GLASS SHATTERING ) ( SCREAMING ) The funny thing is , her wish was to spend a little more time with you . Shame about LaVonne . She wanted so badly to be rich , but ended up just another paw girl . ( CACKLING ) still , you 'II be pleased to know , kiddies , that the girls settled their Differences and reopened the store as Ye olde Gore-iocity Shoppe . It 's so nice to see a little family business that gruesome . ( LAUGHING ) As for me , I 'm afraid a few of my investment strategies have got me into trouble with the " Die-RS . " Not to worry though , the joke 's on him . I 'm about to make a killing . ( LAUGHING )

 Since the dawn of creation it is the male of the species who asserts himself as protector of the clan . He stands ready to face the imminent onslaught of his oncoming rivals . His nostrils flare . He fires . Victory ! The clan lives to see another sunrise . There you go , sweetie . You 're up , ace . You 're going down , clown . Do over ! Do over . It slipped . Hit the showers . My turn . If it 's any consolation you did better than I expected . It 's-it 's not my fault . It 's not my fault . Then whose fault is it ? I blame Dad . LISA : You blame your dad ? Explain to me how he 's responsible for you being a spaz ? It 's a father 's job to teach his kid stuff . But did my dad ever teach me to throw a baseball ? No . He was too busy being a corporate bigwig . - I mean , just look at him . - Fax me the contracts . I 'll get back to you in a minute . Hold on , I 'm getting another call . You know , Wyatt 's got something there . Why should we be blamed for our own shortcomings ? I blame my dad , too . He 's a cold , distant , self-centered man . - Just look at him . - ( Whinnying ) So he taught me to ride his back . How does that help me get girls ? - It doesn 't , that 's how . - What 's the problem ? Just go play catch with your dads . It 's too late now . It should have happened when we were kids . - I could zap you into jocks . - Your magic always wears off . - We need something more reliable . - No offense taken . Oh , wait ! I got a great idea . Okay , now stay with me on this . What if we went back in time to when we were kids . - I can do that . - But you zap us into our dad 's bodies . Then Gary and I as our dads teach us our younger selves how to throw a baseball . Got it ? Yeah , like in Quantum Leap . Sounds like sloppy wishing to me but whatever . It worked . I 'm in my dad 's body . Oh , boy . Wyatt , am I wearing a dress ? Yes . Wyatt , am I wearing pumps ? - Yes . - Wyatt , what 's wrong with this picture ? The pumps don 't match the belt ? You 're a riot , Alice . Hey , guys ... Gary , why are you wearing a dress ? 'Cause I 'm my mom . Oops . Did I do that ? - I did that , didn 't I ? - Let me fix it . No , no , magic . I 'm just grateful I 'm still human . This is ridiculous . Let me crank up my zapper . - I 'll give it another shot . - No , no , then you might really screw things up . Look , I 'm my dad and Gary 's his mom . Close enough . Let 's go find little Gary and little Wyatt . Some thanks . I did transport you back in time and put you in your parent 's bodies . That 's pretty impressive , if you ask me . Sloppy wishers . Okay , now go like this . Great . Now go show your mom . ( Cackling ) Hey , Dad . Mrs. Wallace . Can I have a couple of friends over ? I promise I won 't touch your stereo . Uh , sure . Oh , and uh ... Get a haircut clean your room and clean your brother 's room . - Clean Wyatt 's room ? - Yeah , and uh ... While you 're at it start referring to your brother as Mr. Wyatt the greatest little brother in the whole world . Huh ? - Say it . - Uh , Mr. Wyatt the greatest little brother in the whole world . - Hi , Chett . - Hey , Sis . I mean , Mr. Wyatt , the greatest little brother in the whole world . Gary : Hey , I forgot what a little porker you were . I wasn 't fat . I was husky . Are you kidding ? For crying out loud look at you . You were a planet with feet . Oh , yeah ? I had a slow metabolism . You would have eaten your feet if you could have reached them . I 'll kill you ! You want a piece of the action , huh ? - Huh , fat boy ? - I got your fat boy right here . Uh , honey ? Uh ... Thanks , Emily . Hey , Al , that is quite the little back-cracker you married there . I am so loose . Dad , can we go ? I got to tink . Geez , Gary , again ? You just went . All right , let 's go . Emily , you coming ? Uh , yes , dear . - Butterball . - Puddles . Okay , Wyatt , I 'm going to teach you how to throw a ball . It may not seem like a big deal now but trust me , it 's your ticket to meeting babes . I don 't want babes . I want a nutty-buddy . We 're going to play catch . It 's as simple as that . So take the mitt off your head and catch the stupid ball . Come on , Gary . What do you say to going outside with your mom and playing some catch ? No . Come on , just you and me chucking the ball around . No . Al . Talk to your son . Get him out of the house away from the TV . Play some catch with him . You know , that 's a great idea . Turn off the TV for a change . It 's time for a little father-son bonding . Get out in the fresh air , hitting the old horsehide . - What do you say , son ? - No . Okey-doke . Hey . - Is that Miami Vice ? - Yep . Gary , this is a complete disaster . I forgot I can 't throw . - How 's it going there ? - Not good . I forgot what a waste-case I was . My hobbies were TV and peeing . You can 't survive without magic for ten minutes . Well , it sure looks like you need magic now . Maybe if you beg . I 'm talking about serious down-on-your-knees begging . I might consider ... Why don 't we sign the boys up for little league ? - Great idea . - Pick me up . Hey , I wasn 't done taunting . What are they up to ? Come on , boy , we 're going for a ride . No . There should be a little league sign-up sheet by the rec office . Okay , let 's hurry . This bra 's like a medieval torture device . I can 't believe what women endure to contort their bodies into pleasing shapes for the unwelcome gaze of men . Guys are staring ? I still turn heads . If the bra hurts so much , just take it off . You 've obviously never taken off a bra . It 's not that easy . I 'll need your help . You know , I used to dream about the first time a woman would ask me to take off her bra . Somehow I imagined the moment a little differently . Wyatt , get in here and take this bad boy off of me . They got to be around here someplace . I can 't hold it anymore , Dad . I got to tink . Oh , all right . Here , go in here . EMILY : You 've got to twist real hard . WAYNE : Hike your dress up on your head . - EMILY : That 's it . - WAYNE : You got it . ( Contented sigh ) That feels good . At last . You 're a natural , my friend . My first bra . Hi . Al ? - Emily ? - It 's not what you think . I can explain . No , I can 't- - But Wayne can , I hope . Tell him , Wayne . Uh , well ... Al , basically , um ... In a nutshell I was helping Emily remove her ... her bra here in the porta potti because when we were strolling by recently she , uh ... - Okay , I 'm going to back up here . - There was a bee in my bra . That 's right . That 's right . And she needed to get out of this thing fast . Believe me , that she was riled . So with no concern for my own personal safety I jumped in there and ripped off her bra ... Here you go . Enough with the lies . This is hanky-panky plain and simple . You can keep the bra and the woman that goes in it . Did you zip up ? Perfect- - right now my dad 's listening to country music in some dive telling Roy the bartender how I done him wrong . It 's not like I 'm all kicked up about being the " other man . " Try being the " other woman . " And what do we say when he does show up ? Are we sticking with the " bee in the bra " story ? We have to . I think I know a way to sell it . We show him your bee sting . What bee sting ? Okay , when I hit the hive , they 're going to be mad . Ready ? Is a man ever truly ready to put a bee in his bra ? Do it for your folks , Gar . Do it for your folks . - Let her fly . - Yeah , right . ( Glass breaking ) I detect a slight flaw in our brilliant plan . So , word is you guys need a bee . Meet my friend . His name is Buzzy , he 's a drone and someday he hopes to meet the queen . Be gentle , Buzzy . Oh , it 's not that easy . You mocked my magic , so now you must pay . First you have to wear the bad hairdos of forgiveness for one week and eat this clump of dirt . Fine . Do it your way . Okay , okay ... The honey attracts the bees they sting your boob . Bada-bing- - hard evidence in a soft place . And we don 't have to eat dirt . Now undo your blouse . Ooh ! It 's cold . Whoo ... Oh , it 's cold ... Good lord ! Kids , upstairs now . Uh , M-Mom ... Marcia ... - Didn 't hear you come in . - Naturally . You seem to have had your hands full . Uh ... There is a funny explanation for this . - I got a bee sting . - Sh-she 's allergic . Wayne was applying lifesaving aloe vera to the sting . - That 's honey . - Right ... honey makes ... the pain go away . Well , then dip me in honey ... because I hurt all over ! ( Sobbing ) Oh , boy . ( Crying ) ( Crying ) ( Screams ) ( Screaming continues ) Yeah , your radiator 's cracked . Don 't worry , I 'll give you a free tow . - I know the owner . - ( Crying ) : Thanks , Al . - Ah , don 't cry . - ( Whimpering ) Wayne doesn 't know what he 's got . Heck , you 're the prettiest gal on the block . - Everybody say so . - Everybody ? Emily doesn 't know what she 's got , Al . Well ... uh ... Let 's hook her up and , uh , move out , okay ? Say , Al ... can I buy you dinner ? LISA : Ah , yes , the bad hairdos for forgiveness . All right , then , you 've earned a little magic . Here . Bad idea . When my dad drinks , he 's all hands . It 's gullible juice . One sip and they 'll believe anything you tell them . Even that ridiculous bee story . Better make it a double . ( Rock music playing ) What 's going on ? Oh , shoot . I forgot I told Chett he could have a couple of friends over . Look , we 've got to find my mom . - Let 's split up , okay ? - Right . Uh-oh , busted . Dad ... I can explain this . I invited a couple friends over . Things got a little out of hand ... And I have no idea how the hole in the bathroom wall got there . I don 't care about the party . Where 's your mother ? You really don 't care about the party ? No . - Could I have a jeep ? - Yeah , yeah , sure . Oh , by the way , really cool hair ... if you 're some kind of freak . Great party , huh ? Um ... your slip is showing . Is that what that is ? - I got to tink . - You just went . - I want a moonpie . - No peeing . No eating . We 're going to learn how to throw a baseball . You stink . I can 't find my mom anywhere . We 're both dead . Where 's the gullible juice ? Uh ... oh , I know exactly where I left it . Don 't go anywhere . Oh ... thanks , Al . You know , that jolly meal did cheer me up a bit . Yeah , it always picks me up . Trouble is , they 're for kids . I got to eat , like , eight of them . ( Laughs ) Want to come in for coffee ? You got instant ? ( Giggling ) Uh ... Marcia , Al ! What are you doing here ? I can 't believe this . Our marriage is falling apart and you two are having a party ? Dad ! Um , I mean ... Sweetums . Don 't " sweetums " me . I swear we can clear everything up ... After you two have a drink . Care for a snort ? - It 's empty . - It 's empty ? Throwing a ball can be fun . Watch . Oops . ( Yelling ) Ahh ! - Bees ! - Bees ! It was the biggest bee I ever saw ! No more bees , bras or bullpucky . This was no ordinary bee . This was one of those killer bees that came across the border from ... - Canada . They 're ... - Snow bees ! And they migrate South looking for warm weather . That 's why it flew into my bra . It was seeking the warmth of my bosom . - Give me a break . - It 's true . I 've heard of killer snow bees . Uh , yeah , they crossed the border from Canada . And they fly into bras to stay warm . Gullible juice ? GARY : They spiked the punch . I don 't know what is in that punch but you 've all clearly - had too much of it . - Maybe it 's not so improbable . If these kids have all heard of snow bees then their story must be true . Twenty teenagers can 't be wrong ... Ten or twelve , maybe- - but twenty ! Whoo-hoo ! Hey , sorry I ever doubted you , em . Give me a squeeze . Bees ! Marcia , Marcia , don 't go ! I would never do anything to hurt you- - never ! I want to believe you , but your story 's preposterous . The idea of killer snow bees migrating down from Canada for the express purpose of flying into women 's bras to seek warmth ? I-it 's bullpucky . - I 'm sorry . - Goodbye . Bees ! Bees ! Snow bees ! Oh , it 's in my bra ! It 's in my bra ! Oh ! Oh ... Oh ! Oh , I 'm stung ! I 'm stung ! Oh ! Ow ! Oh , oh ... Oh ... oh ... Say ... you know , that does make it feel a lot better . - Thanks , Al . - Oh , it 's just instinct . You know , when I saw that snow bee going for your bra I knew I had to get my hands in there fast . Ahem . I think a couple of apologies are in order . - Don 't push it . - No , Emily 's right . I do owe you both an apology . I didn 't trust you , Wayne . I 'm sorry- - I should have . But now I 'm willing to believe anything you have to tell me . You can start with the hair . Well , we never did learn how to throw a baseball . Yeah , but we saved our parents ' marriages . And without any magical help from Lisa . We 're good . So good . Good going , Buzzy . I owe you one . Okay , okay , I 'll introduce you . Her name is Elizabeth but she likes to be called " Queenie . " Captioned by Grant Brown

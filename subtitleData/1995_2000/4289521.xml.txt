Medic over here . ! [ Woman # 2 Chattering ] - [ Hissing ] - [ Chattering ] Command sent down orders . We 're shipping ' out again . - We just got in . - Mission brief 's in 40 mikes . Not even time to hit the showers . - Let ' em send someone else . - [ Shane ] Lose it , Wang . ! The 47 th never made it back from Ceres . [ Man ] We 're losin ' him ! He 's fibrillatin ' ! Gimme a heart needle . ! Two milligrams P.C. V ... ! Stat . ! - [ Monitor Wailing ] - Let 's get him up to O. R ... ! [ Engines Droning ] - [ Man ] Get him on the respirator . - [ Alarm Buyying ] Check it out . New meat . Look at ' em . They 've got no idea . - They look so young . - Did we ever look that young ? We must have that thousand-meter stare . Yeah . Look at the way they 're lookin ' at us . Like we know something . - You think you 're bad , Private ? - Sir , I do , sir ! - You think you 're mean . ! - Sir , the meanest . ! - You think you 're gonna kill some Chigs ? - Sir , yes , sir . ! Look around , puke . ! What do you see ? - What do you see ? - I see life-takers and heartbreakers , sir ! You see blood ! You see sweat ! - Believers comin ' home in mummy sacks ! - Nathan , take it easy ! You take a good look at those Glad Bags , boot . 'Cause some Chig 's gonna cut your cable ... and you 're gonna be seein ' one - You 're gonna be seein ' one from inside out . - What the - - Let him go . That kid 's not just some rookie . He 's Nathan 's brother . [ Man ] We thought we were alone . We believed the universe was ours . Until one night in 2063 , on an Earth colony six light-years away ... they struck . And now we are at war . My name is Lieutenant Colonel T.C. McQueen . I 'm an InVitro , a race of artificially gestated humans . I command a Marine Corps squadron - the 58th . The 58th - They call us the Wild Cards . We fight when called - in space , on land and at sea . To lose this war means more than defeat . To surrender is to never go home . All of us must rise to the call above and beyond . Didn 't he know his brother enlisted ? He knew , but what were the chances ... of running into Neil in the middle of all this ? Thank God my brother is not old enough to sign up . [ Knocking ] Neil . Shane Vansen . I met you before the war . Came home with your brother on leave . - How could I forget ? [ Chuckles ] - This is Lieutenant Hawkes ... Lieutenant Damphousse and Lieutenant Wang . - Welcome aboard , Neil . - You got your bird legs ? Yeah , but I 'm glad to be back in standard gravity , you know ? [ Chuckles ] [ Shane ] Well , we got a mission briefing in a couple mikes , so we gotta head out . It 's good to see you . [ Sniffles , Sobs ] - What are you doing here ? - I came to explain . Uh - - You can 't . - Mom and Dad weren 't happy either ... but they respect my decision . I told you to stay in college . - The war might have been over by then . - You joined . Yeah , I joined . I joined to become a Colonial Sentry . My chance to get to Tellus . - The war broke out . I had no choice . - Well , I have a choice . - And it 's to fight . - What the hell do you know about fightin ' ? The Chigs are a dark-hearted enemy , Nathan . They 'll stop short of nothing less than total annihilation . Look , it 's not about losing a way oflife . It 's about losing life . That sounds good and all . But when you 're out here ... - it 's got nothing to do with that . - [ Scoffs ] Yeah . Well , uh , I wanted you to have this . [ Panting ] Next touchdown wins . No . The game is to five . You 're ahead four to one , Nathan . I don 't even wanna play when you get all mad . Next touchdown wins . Come on ! [ Neil Grunts ] - [ Grunts ] - Fumble ! [ Nathan Groans ] You fumbled on purpose . No , I didn 't . It just slip - - You let me win . You always let me win . - Well , what do you want from me ? If I beat you , you get mad , and if I let you win , you get mad . If you 're going to win , just let me lose . [ Man Shouting ] Gentlemen , can you taste victory ? - Sir , yes , sir . ! - How does it taste ? - Mmm , mmm , good . - Tell ' em who we are ! Fifth Force Recon ! Highly motivated ! Truly dedicated ! Rompin ' ! Stompin ' ! United States Marine Corps ! - Eichler , what are we here for ? - Kill , kill , kill . ! - Miller , who do we kill ? - Chigs , Chigs , Chigs ! Donovan , how do we kill Chigs ? Swift , silent , deadly . ! - West , who 's the best ? - Fifth Force Recon , sir ! What 's with the semper psycho ? I know the scoop on Herrick . He 's with Fifth Force Recon ... second lieutenant , drafted right out of Dartmouth . Honors graduate of O.C.S. And T.B.S. Military occupational specialty-infantry . Yeah . Feels like one of those textbook Shake ' N Bakes . Gets command before he 's even done his time in the thick . How can such a pogue get command when he 's never even seen a Chig ? He seems more interested in his Silver Star than getting his men home in one piece . [ Herrick ] Situation - enemy soldiers carrying assault weapons are dug in ... 50 klicks from our position ! They are planning to interrupt our convoy of supplies ! - Miller , what 's our mission ? - Seek and destroy , sir ! Surrounding terrain is a triple-canopy jungle ! Enemy soldiers are dug in at unknown positions ! - West , what do we do ? - Call in artillery , sir ! Artillery ? Are you a cake boy , West ? - Sir , no , sir ! - You talk like one ! - Sir , yes , sir . ! - We 're out in thejungle ... staring down the barrel of an M-590 and a battalion of bloodthirsty Chigs ! We don 't know where they are ! We don 't know how many are out there ! We don 't have time to call artillery ! We gotta start blowing heads off ... before they start blowing ours all over the damn jungle ! Is that clear , West ? - Sir , yes , sir . ! - I can 't hear you . ! - Stand down , West . - This guy 's a rock . - Yes , sir ! - He 's Pvt. West 's commanding offiicer . - It 's not your place . - [ Tirade Continues ] Mission brief 's in the Orientation Room . - [ Herrick ] Is that clear , West ? - Sir , yes , sir . ! - Is that clear ? - Move out . - Sir , yes , sir . ! - This isn 't boot camp . ! This is real . ! We 're about to engage the enemy on tumultuous terrain . ! We don 't have time for insubordinate ... - recalcitrant maggot pukes ! - Lieutenant . Give me your rifle . - Don 't you like me , Herrick ? - Yes , sir . - Are you trying to get me killed ? - No , sir . What 's the first rule of general rifle safety ? " Consider every weapon to be loaded ... until proven otherwise , " sir . If you can read it , Herrick , why can 't you execute it ? An unloaded weapon always shoots the loudest . This one 's a recon mission - strictly intel gathering . You will be deployed to the planet Mors . You will be dropped behind enemy lines ... where you will remain undetected until extraction . Your mission is strictly observation and information gathering . You are not to engage the enemy unless under attack . You will take digital photographs ... mark coordinates of enemy facilities ... document any transport activity ... including ammunition convoys and artillery batteries . The directives of this mission ... - are not to leave this room . - [ Herrick ] Sir . How can we be certain we 're achieving our objectives if we don 't know the plan ? The greater plan isn 't your concern , Lieutenant . The 14th , 19th and 33rd squadrons ... will be deployed to the eastern region of Mors . - The 58th to the north . - Colonel ... that leaves the 58 uncovered to the west . We don 't have a choice . The 47 th squadron was expected to be a part of this mission , sir . They didn 't make it back from Ceres . Right now there 's a shortage of available men . A MERG satellite could provide the fifth position . No . I want eyes on the ground . Sir . I volunteer Fifth Force . Your team has an assignment , Lieutenant . In the rear with the gear . With all due respect , sir . You want eyes on the ground . We 've got 10 to spare . Sir , Fifth Force isn 't ready for this mission . Sir , we 're marines . We 're born ready . Lieutenant , this is a sensitive maneuver . One false step and the entire mission could be compromised . Sir . If I may speak freely . - Sit down , Private . - Let him speak . Sir , on behalf of Lieutenant Herrick ... he graduated from O.C.S. And T.B.S. With top honors . He 's tough , he 's smart , he 's got impeccable instincts ... and we 'd follow him anywhere . I know I speak for all of us when I say we didn 't come here to sit on our packs . We want to get into this war . Sit down , Private . All right , I 'm going to allow Fifth Force to provide the fifth eye . However , I do so with the understanding that Fifth Force ... will be sent down strictly as a support element to the 58 . Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . Don 't be in such a hurry to die , Lieutenant . You 'll get your chance . Dismissed ! [ Huffs ] West . This is the commodore 's decision . Now , you 've got a problem , and I know what it is . But I also know that your responsibility to this mission comes first . If you let your personal agenda influence your conduct as a marine ... you jeopardize yourself and every man in this unit . Like the commodore said , this is a sensitive maneuver . Get in , do the job , get out . We 're not looking for heroes . Yes , sir . [ Shane ] Move ! Nathan , cover ! Everyone else - Move , move , move , move ! [ Herrick ] Go , go , move it , move it . ! Come on . ! Go , go , go . ! - Let 's go . ! - Let 's move ! Move out ! [ Aircraft Engines Whirring ] Designated coordinates for hide-spots 6-4-niner , 2-0-8-7-niner . - [ Device Beeps ] Fall in behind me . Column formation . Move out ! [ Vanessa ] This is where we dig in . Herrick , you 're digging in 30 meters west . Go , go , go ! Fifth Force , move out ! Fresh legs . [ Radio : Herrick ] Bravo One , this is Alpha Two . Our position is secured . [ Sighs ] Maybe we 're losing it . There 's a lot more to good command than digging a fast foxhole . [ Aircraft Zooming Overhead ] [ Wind Gusts Whistling ] [ Beeping ] Yeah . Just Chig jets on patrol . Wait a minute . I see something . It looks like a - like a Chig C-3 Tower . Roger , One . I see it . Wang , get the E.T.C. Monitor . Pinpoint their position . [ Shane ] Air Command can take ' em out in the next strike . I say we go out now . Blow that puppy sky high . Negative . We 're not to engage the enemy . We don 't have to engage . We set a C670 . Chigs 'll never know what hit it . - Negative . That 's not our mission . - Our mission is to win this war . We blow that tower up ... we take out communications in half the Bacchus region . Negative , Herrick . That 's an order . Whoa . Whoa , West . What the hell are you doing ? Alpha Two , we need a spare T-140 transistor . - Roger that . - Rendeyvous in between . Send West . [ Herrick ] You heard him . [ Grunting ] [ Wind Whistling ] [ Panting ] Neil . Watch your six with Herrick . First , you tell me not to enlist , and now you 're tellin ' me what to do ? - The guy thinks he 's John Wayne . - Who ? Look , I 've seen his kind before , all right ? Long on gung ho with nothing to back it up except a squad of men . - He 's my C.O. - Doesn 't mean he knows what he 's doing . Well , how do I know you know what you 're doing ? The only fight I 've ever seen you in was with Craig MacPherson ... when he asked Kylen to the winter dance . Look , Nathan , I may be a rookie , but one look around here ... I can tell this ain 't no winter dance . I 've been through a lot . I 've seen a lot . All right , Herrick 's never even seen battle . He 's got a lot to learn . Don 't be his guinea pig . He 'll learn it with your life , my life ... and the life of every one of your buddies . [ Neil ] You 've been in the corps twice as long as Herrick ... and some girl 's quarterbacking your team . [ Nathan ] She 's 10 times the marine Herrick 'll ever be . ! [ Scoffing Chuckle ] Yeah , I guess we 'll find out . Look , I 'm trying to keep you from gettin ' killed ! Why can 't you just let me lose ? [ Sighing ] I kicked MacPherson 's ass , you know . - Hey , Mom could 've kicked that doof . - [ Chuckles ] Yeah , Mom could take on a whole Chig division and send ' em packing ' . [ Laughs , Sighs ] You know , I 'd - I 'd give anything for us both to be home right now ... - getting yelled at for coming in late . - [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Listen , bro . Herrick 's a good marine . I 'll be okay . [ Sighs , Sniffles ] Nathan , if that had been any other marine over there ... you would 've never pulled that stunt with the radio . - You would 've come to me . - Herrick 's trouble , Shane . You know that . Herrick hasn 't done anything wrong . I can 't condemn him because you 're afraid of losing your brother to him . He 's a loose cannon . He 'll get us all killed . This isn 't about Herrick . This is about you . You have froyen Neil in time . I know how it happens . I did that with my sisters . [ Chuckles ] One of my sister 's is married . I still look at her like she 's 12 . Neil 's not a kid anymore . Look , brothers , sisters , they always see the differences in each other . They never realiye that they came from the same place . Neil - he 's ... loyal ... dedicated , stubborn - a lot tougher than he looks . - And that 's a description of me ? - Mmm . [ Chuckles ] Neil 's either gonna learn to how to make it through ... or he 's not . You can 't control what 's gonna happen . You can 't follow him through the whole war . Let him go . If I do ... I might lose him . [ Scoffs ] If you don 't , you 're gonna lose him anyway . Look . He only said what he did cause he 's worried about you . He 's a control freak . The problem is he doesn 't trust you as a warrior . But he will . Rookies gotta prove themselves - go through a - a baptism before they 're respected . You think you 're alone in this ? We all got the same problem . We all gotta prove we can cut it . Until we do , 58th won 't accept us as one of them . - Nobody will . - How are we supposed to prove anything ? We 're damn recon . All we get to do is avoid the enemy . You gotta be creative , Donovan . You all remember Dan Daly ? He was a sergeant in World War I , the most brutal war ever . And he was the meanest devil dog in the valley . They called him the " fightin ' - est marine they ever knew , " and , man , he deserved it . He single-handedly wiped out all those German machine gun nests . He lead charges against the enemy , and always - every time-he beat the hell out of them . He 'd go into battle yelling , " Come on , you sons of bitches . You wanna live forever ? " He was awarded the Navy Cross , the Distinguished Service Cross ... two Purple Hearts ... the French victory medal with four clasps . Now , we all know he didn 't get those medals sitting ' around in foxholes . He earned them ... thinking for himself ... taking initiative . He got creative , and he got rewarded for it . Our chance ... to make a difference has arrived . It 's time for us to take the initiative . Now , there 's a Chig satellite tower out there . I say we take a C670 and we blow the crap out of it . Sir , we were told not to leave our position . Told to do ? The Marine Corps doesn 't want robots . They want thinking men . Daly sure wasn 't a robot . And look what happened . A hundred years later they 're still talking about him . We play our cards right , a hundred years from now they 'll be talking about us . Come on , you sons of bitches . You wanna live forever ? [ Device Beeping , Whirring ] - Target is acquired . - Call the Fifth . Have them establish cypher link to triangulate and confirm its position . Alpha Two , engage E.T.C. Cypher unit . Alpha Two . Come in , Alpha Two . - No one 's responding . - Where the hell did they go ? This is it . Let 's blow this baby . Sir , there 's been no prior intelligence mission in this area . I know . We 're it . We 'rejust adding a little initiative . Donovan . Eichler . Locate the control box . I 'll attach a C670 . West . Miller . Stay here . Keep an eye out . [ Beeps , Whirs ] There 's no control box . There 's none over here either . There 's gotta be electronics . Wait a minute . This thing isn 't even operable . - It 's bogus . - What ? It 's a dummy , like those fake planes the British used to trick the Germans . - [ Shells Whistling Overhead , Explosion ] - Incoming ! [ Panicked Yells ] - There 's incoming down by the satellite tower ! - Who 's in a fire fight ? Herrick . Our position is compromised . Get McQueen on the radio . Tell him we 've got a broken arrow , that Fifth Force is under heavy fire ... and we are in no - no position to provide support . ! We need immediate extraction ! [ Radio : Damphousse ] Wild Cards to Queen Six . Wild Cards to Queen Six . Fifth Force has engaged the enemies . Broken Arrow . Repeat . Broken Arrow . Request immediate extraction . Repeat . Immediate extraction . Have it pinpoint the location of the signal reception . Dispatch a squadron of SA43s and a rescue APC for a bull 's-eye extraction . [ Herrick Shouting ] Fall back ! Fall back ! Move , move , move ! Behind the wall ! Behind the wall ! Move it ! Move it ! [ Explosions Continue ] Alpha Two to Bravo One ! Come in , Bravo One ! - Herrick , fall back ! That is a direct order ! - Chigs jumped us ! We 're not falling back until we get payback ! There 's no way they can hold that position ! Herrick , you are in violation of the directives of this mission . - Get back here ! - [ Gunfire , Yelling ] I didn 't seek engagement ! I was fired upon ! I can see ' em . There 's only seven or eight of 'em . - We can take ' em . - All right . - Let 's do it . ! - Go . ! Hoo-ya ! Capped one ! - [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Excited Chatter ] [ Overlapping Shouts ] - [ Alarm Wailing ] - [ Man Shouting ] Go , go , go . ! [ P. A : Woman ] Commencing Hammerhead engagement sequence . Stand by for launch . [ Engines Whirring ] - Wild Cards , this is Queen Six . - I 'm receiving transmission . Wild Cards , this is Queen Six . Broken Arrow received . Air cover has been deployed . Will reach your position in 40 mikes . Request coordinates for rendeyvous . Rendezvous at 6-2-niner ... 7-0-6-8-niner ... - north / northwest of bull 's-eye . - Roger that . Herrick , air cover 's gonna be here in 40 mikes . - [ Explosion ] - Herrick ? - Ammo check ! Ammo check ! - Right . Checkin ' . - We 've held ! It 's our window to fall back ! - Forget it , West ! We can do this ! We can take ' em ! Sir , we only got about four clips per man ! - Then that 's what we use ! - [ Groans ] - Herrick ? - He 's not responding . Nathan , you know better ! Air cover is on its way to these coordinates . Alpha Two , this is Bravo One . Come in , Alpha Two ! - What happened ? - Get down ! - Get down . ! - Why did they stop firing ? - Probably reloading . - [ Shane On Radio ] Alpha Two , respond . Now ! - Damn ! - This is it , men . The baptism . 58th wants us to put our tail between our legs and run . I say we get up on that wall and fight . Hit these S.O.B. ' s right between the running lights . [ Calmly ] Herrick . Don 't even think about it . You wanna charge ' em straight on ? Neil , listen to me , man . [ Nathan Over Radio ] Neil , do the right thing . Do the right thing . Sir , we 're in violation of the mission . So now you 're listenin ' to him ? Your brother 's cowering a hundred yards back in a foxhole . We 're the one 's out here trying to make a difference . This ain 't a democracy . I 'm your commanding officer . We do this , we 're heroes . Five-eight , this is the Fifth Force . - We 're makin ' a direct assault on the enemy . - Listen . Not just Neil , all of you , listen . You go over that wall , you 're dead ! You hear me ? Don 't go over that wall , you 're cowards . Right now you 've got no brother . Right now we 're your brothers . " We few . We happy few . We band of brothers . " [ Radio : Nathan ] Listen . Listen , Neil . The only thing that matters is your life , man . ! Your life and the lives of your buddies ! You go over that wall , and you all die foolishly ! Show ' em what you can be . Let 's do it . [ Yells ] [ Cocks Weapon ] [ Yelling ] - [ Agonized Scream ] - [ Yelling , Groaning ] [ Grunts ] - [ Yelling ] - Nathan ! No , no ! Neil ! - They 're coming out of cover ! - Right ! Herrick should 've checked ' em ! The Chigs were hidin' the whole time ! - How is he ? - Not dead . Wounded . - They 're flanking our left ! - Look , there 's no way to outflank them ... not with just a couple of guys ! [ Explosions ] Oh , God ! We 're all going to die ! Don 't talk like that ! If you talk like that , we will die ! - Get on the ground . ! Take cover . ! - Nathan ! - Nathan , this is Neil . ! - Neil ! Neil ! Neil ! I hear you , man ! What 's your status ? We 're taking casualties ! Herrick 's hit ! We 're almost out of ammo ! All right , listen , man . I need your position . Give me your position . - [ Explosion ] - [ Yells ] Donovan 's hit ! God . ! He 's bleeding . He 's bleeding ! - [ Shouts ] Donovan 's down ! - [ Explosions Continue ] - Oh , God . - [ Whimpers ] He 's dead . [ Neil Whimpering ] Oh , God . Oh , God . Listen , Neil !

[ Whimpering ] I 'm so scared . - [ Explosion ] - [ West Cries Out ] Neil ! Neil ! - They almost took your head off ! - [ Projectile Zooming ] [ Indistinct ] You heard him ! They 're on the way !

Move out ! [ Explosions Continue ] [ Cooper Yells ] Go ! There 's no way that we can charge them straight on . - Air strike should be here in five mikes ! - What do we do for five mikes ? - Make ' em think we got more than we do . - Lay down covering fire . ! We 'll hit the Chigs on their left flank and catch ' em on a cross fire ! Good . Then Fifth Force can fall back to a supplementary position . - Let 's move ! - Let 's go !

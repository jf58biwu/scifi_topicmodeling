 You make man ? No . Woman . FRANKENSTEIN 'S MONSTER ( ON TELEVISION ) : Woman ? THEME SONG : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . Ooh ! My creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold , just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Ooh ! My creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand . He 's alive . Alive ! I think we 're being watched . Huh ? What , by Super Fly over there ? He followed us in and he 's been staring at us the whole time . [ ZAP ] Whoa ! Thanks a lot , Lis . I paid $ 2.75 for that cappuccino . You was robbed . Lis , that guy over there has been watching us . I don 't believe this . [ ZAP ] Yow ! Didn 't hurt . [ ZAP ] I think I missed a chapter somewhere . At what point did Chett develop Brady hair ? [ RIP ] Yah ! Spirit gum . He was tailing you guys , figuring you 'd eventually lead him to me . And I was right . Now , that kind of cleverness deserves a reward , like a free wish . That 's what this is about ? Ever since he found out I exist , he hasn 't let up . Lisa , give me a million dollars . Lisa , fill the pool with Rolling Rock . Lisa , get me a guest spot on " Friends . " Lisa , I want you to maroon me on a desert island . Huh ? Chett marooned ? Isn 't that one of our wishes ? I know it sounds weird . But it 's a perfect vacation for a real man . Hard , lean , and alone against the elements like " Robinson Crusoe " or that Brazilian cannibal soccer team ? A true test of manhood . I even picked out the coordinates . And here 's the beauty part . Grant my wish and I swear I 'll never bug you again . BOTH : Never ? Hell , I 'd settle for a three day weekend . You 've got a deal . [ BEACH MUSIC PLAYING ] [ ZAP ] Oh yeah ! This is the life I was cut out for . Hard , lean , alone , against the elements . I 'm going to slap a saddle on Mother Nature and bend her to my iron will . Now , supposed to boil this stuff before I drink it , right ? It 's optional . Here , genius . Survival radio . Oh , very nice . Got to have my Stern in the morning . It also doubles as a homing device . When you get tired of living off the land , press this signal button . I 'll hear it and zap you back . Well , don 't wait up , babe . I 've got an island to conquer . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] So what are we looking at ? WYATT DONNELLY : This program is keyed into the homing device . It will show us where Lisa and Chett are . I wonder what 's taking her so long . She must have stuck around for a little fun in the surf . My backpack ! [ WAVES CRASHING ] Stupid ocean . What good is it ? Stop whining . I 'll zap you up some more supplies before I go . [ ZAP ] What the hell was that ? I don 't know . Something 's interfering with my magic . This place is making me nervous . I 'm zapping us out of here . [ ZAP ] [ BEEPING ] Uh , should this worry me ? [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] Great . Lisa and Chett are trapped in the scariest place on Earth ! Kansas ? It scares me . Supposedly there is some sort of atmospheric anomaly in the Bermuda Triangle that makes electricity act all funky . That 's why so many boats and planes get lost there . What 's that got to do with Lisa ? She 's not a boat . She 's a genie . Her magic feeds on electricity . You know , we would have avoided a lot of trouble over the years if Lisa ran on natural gas . Let 's not panic yet . In a crisis , you can always count on Lisa for a good plan . LISA : OK . So we set all the trees on fire . A fishing troller sees the smoke and comes to investigate . And finds our bodies charred , extra crispy . Why don 't we just set off a nuke gun ? Somebody would be sure to notice . OK , Mr. Johnny No Likey . Let 's hear a decent idea out of you . OK . How about you and me lie naked on a rock , nothing between us but the occasional air pocket ? Come on . Take a wild ride on the Chett Donnelly love flue . Uh huh . Right . I 've been told I 'm cuddly . [ BEACH MUSIC PLAYING ] We better find some shelter soon . Jeez , this stuff is thick . Let me help you there . Oh ! [ PUNCH ] What ? My hand slipped . Oh , somebody else is here . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Was here . Even better . If they 're not here now , then maybe somebody rescued them . From the Bermuda Triangle ? Not likely . We 're where ? Or at least I 'm assuming that 's where we are because why else wouldn 't your magic be working ? Of course . I can 't get a decent charge because we 're in the Bermuda Triangle . You trapped me here on purpose . Guilty . Why ? Come on . You and me , alone , no hope of rescue ? As far as you 're concerned , I 'm the last man on earth . Well , there 's nothing left to do now but to start propagating . I want you out of here . You , alone in the jungle . What are you going to do when the humidity frizzes your pretty hair ? Or you come across a big bug . Who 's going to kill it for you ? You need me . Admit it . I 'd rather give Mickey Rourke a tongue bath . Fine . But don 't come crawling to me when I 'm living the life of an island god and you 're eating worms . [ BEACH MUSIC PLAYING ] [ SNAKE HISSING ] Chett and Lisa have been missing two weeks . And since we don 't have enough bucks to charter a dough cart , let alone a plane , I hereby declare a state of emergency . Time to break out the emergency wish . The what ? WYATT DONNELLY : Right around the time we first created Lisa , I had her set up a delayed action wish . You know , in case there was an emergency one day when she wasn 't around . She hid it in one of my squirrel figurines . We had a free wish laying around for years and you never told me about it ? WYATT DONNELLY : Gar , you would have blown it anyway . Huh ? My squirrels . Somebody took my squirrels ! LISA : Help ! Help ! Help ! Damn stupid ankle . [ WHISTLING ] Trouble ? No . Go away , jerk . I 'm sorry . Seeing as how I 'm the only other person on the island , I foolishly assumed you were calling me . My mistake . Oh , hey , look . Tide 's coming in . Toodles . Hate him . Hate him . Hate him . Come back ! Did I hear a please after that command ? It must have gotten lost in the breeze . Please , OK ? Please help me ? No problem , fellow castaway . Ah . Jammed in there pretty good . Bite down . [ GRUNTING ] [ THUD ] Ooh . That really , really hurt . What 's wrong with you ? I think I pulled a groin muscle . Ew . Thanks for helping out . It was surprisingly unselfish . Surprisingly ? You 've been hanging out with Booger Boy and Snot Pot too long . They 've poisoned your mind . Oh ? You spend the last 17 years of your life torturing Booger Boy . Snot Pot . Gary 's Booger Boy . Whatever . The point is , I make up my own mind about people . Uh huh . Without giving them a chance , just like everybody else in the world . You want to stay here ? I mean , just until your condition heals . You kidding ? This place is a palace compared to the crummy lean-to I 've got- - which is , you know , the way I like it . But if you need my help- - - I don 't . I 'll stay . Good . [ THUD ] Damn it . Where the hell are my squirrels ? They didn 't just come to life and scamper away ! Hey , look what we missed . " Pit Lick , sold your sissy squirrels for beer money . Love , Chett . " Who would buy a bunch of ceramics rodents ? WYATT DONNELLY : Hey ! Hey , just so you understand , squirrel collecting is very big right now . What ? I picked this up at Squirrel Con in San Diego . San Diego is way better than Boston . I mean , it- - it attracts a lot more of the hardcore dealers . This is some sick demented joke , right ? No . It 's no joke . There are a lot of us squirrel heads out there . Famous ones , too . Al Gore , Adam West , Courtney Love . Squirrel heads ? Uh huh . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] You cooked . I 'll clean . - Tell me something , Chett . - Sure . What do you want to know ? All I ever see of you is this bully who tortures Wyatt . Yet lately you 've been pleasant . I don 't get it . Hey , complicated guy . Lots of levels . I 'm like a nine layer bean dip with feet . So why are you such a wank to Wyatt ? I guess you 'd have to go back to my folks . First day they brought the little sput home from the hospital . How is the little Wyatt poopy penguin schmoo schmoo schmoo ? Oh ! He made a bubble . What is it , Chett ? Why is the baby changing table in my room ? Oh , well , uh , didn 't your father say anything to you about that ? No . Well , sweetie , little babies need a lot of room to grow . That 's why we 're moving you into the sewing room so we 'll have lots of room for little Wyatt 's furniture . You mean he 's getting my room ? Well , that 's right . What a big boy to be so understanding . Pit lick . Damn it , Chett . Wyatt is napping . Bad Chett . Those are Wyatt 's toys . He 's so much smarter than Chett was at that age . Mommy 's little Wyatt made a dookie . What can you do , Chester ? Let me loose and give me back my pants . This isn 't funny . You know , from where I 'm standing , it 's a riot . That 's terrible . How long was poor Wyatt stuck to that bike rack ? An hour or so . And I felt real bad about after I found out the little butt blossom was standing under a hornet 's nest . That 's not funny . Not a bit . [ LAUGHTER ] Can I ask you a serious question ? Shoot . You 're 25 years old . You 're supposed to have grown past all that sibling rivalry stuff . Why do you still pick on him ? Old habits are hard to break , I guess . Besides , he hates me . He doesn 't . I promise you that . It 's OK . I bring it on myself . I pick fights with everybody . Wallace , Scampy , my folks , girlfriends . I don 't hate you . Oh ! I found these growing on the other side of the lagoon . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] Did you hear that ? Yeah . Sure sounds romantic . There is something real sexy about the Spanish language , don 't you think ? [ WIND BLOWING ] Nice breeze . [ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ] [ WIND BLOWING ] [ THUNDER AND LIGHTNING ] There 's no way this hut is going to stand up to the storm . I think you 'll be surprised just how well this baby does hold up . Ha ! Good as new ! Great . What about when that wall falls apart ? Or that wall ? Or the roof flies off ? You know , ever since we found out about this hurricane , you have been in a mood . I 'm serious . If I were Chett and I waned to convert some squirrels into quick cash , I would take them to a used squirrel store . No . You 're making this up . There 's no such thing as a used squirrel store . Son of a gun . One of these scores is hiding a butt full of magic . [ THUNDER AND LIGHTNING ] Answer me straight . Are you scared ? Me ? The Chettinator ? No way . Fess up . You got to be a little scared . Nope . Guys don 't get scared like girls do . It 's genetic . [ LIGHTNING ] I 'm lying . I hate lightning . It 's always scared the snot out of me . I used to hide under the sink whenever there was a storm . I 'm not brave , OK ? I 'm a big sissy coward and the lightning 's close . Ah ! Lightning ! That 's it ! Of course that 's it . We 're about to be toast ! Burnt , crunchy , ' bout to die in a hurricane frickin ' toast . The problem has been the triangle messing with the electricity around here . If we channel the lightning , pure electricity , directly into me , I might have enough power to zap us home . [ LIGHTNING ] Ah ! Make it stop ! What are the things you 're not supposed to do in an electrical storm ? Don 't stand under any trees . Don 't touch anything metal . Let 's go break some rules . WYATT DONNELLY : Gary , wait a second . This is it . You sure ? Chip , chip , chip . Chip , chip . Oh , Mr. West . So good to see you again . Please , Rudolpho . Call me Adam . See ? Huh ? Wow . I can 't believe it 's really you in person . I am such a big fan . Thank you , sonny . My favorite episode is the one where you and Spock beam down to that planet filled with gangsters . That was Shatner . I was Batman . No . No , I 'm sure it was you . Gary , let 's just pay for our squirrel and get out of here . Good god . That 's a Yandrow Nut Gatherer ' 64 series . It differs from the ' 63 series because of the angle of its tail . You 'll notice the tail points in 30 degrees instead of 45 . They only made 14 of these little guys . I must have it . What , hey ? Hey , I saw it first . I think not . Rudolpho , wasn 't I in here just last week admiring this figurine ? Well , Adam . Here 's $ 40 , double the marked price . $ 50 . $ 55 . At last , after all these years , a worthy adversary . [ THUNDER AND LIGHTNING ] Hopefully the antenna will attract the lightning and channel it into me . Are you sure this is going to work ? 50-50 . Either it works or my body won 't be able to handle that amount of electricity . In that case , I 'll probably just explode . Then what are you doing it for ? It 's our only chance . No way ! It 's my choice . You think I want us stuck here forever ? Would it be so bad to be stuck here together ? I mean , if we survive the storm , I mean . We 're just getting the hang of things . I 'd rather take our chances with this weather than risk you getting French fried . [ ELECTRICAL ZAP ] [ SCREAM ] Chett ! WYATT DONNELLY : $ 68 and 40 , 45 , 46 , $ 0.47 . Not so fast , evil-doer . I must find quarters . Aha . $ 69.04 . That 's it . We 're broke . Uh uh . Still got our gold card . Platinum card . Check and mate . [ MUSIC PLAYING ] My squirrel . [ CRASH ] [ ZAP ] Gary , make the wish . I wish we were with Lisa . Gary , you 're a moron . [ ZAP ] Whoa ! That was some kiss . My whole body feels like a bumped funny bone . Thanks to you , my magic 's back in business . We 're ready to go . Let 's boogie . [ ZAP ] I don 't suppose it occurred to you to wish for a round trip , did it ? Eh . Boy , some wind , huh ? Man . Woo . [ ZAP ] So here we are . Us . Here . I , uh- - Mm . Mm , me too . Because you know- - Right . Right . So I guess you want to go see Gary and Wyatt now ? Yeah . Yeah , I guess I 'd better . Hey , you don 't have to tell me because I 've got major life things to catch up on , you know . People to see . You know how it is . I hear you . I hear you . So I guess I 'd better get cracking . We should just let it go . Let what go ? [ SAD MUSIC PLAYING ] [ WAVES CRASHING ] It was in 1972 that I first saw the Hummel Bushy Tail . Ah , those big brown moist eyes reached out and grabbed me the moment I walked in the store and refused to let go . My Bushy Tail remains the pride of my staggeringly large collection . Kill me . Kill me now . Just do it quick , OK ? Tell me more . ADAM WEST : Well , there was the time I noticed the flaw in my ' 76- -

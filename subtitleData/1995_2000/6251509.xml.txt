You can go down to the corner and get fresh tomatoes from Mr. Lee , and you don 't have to feed him Nothin ' . He hates it when you even try . Sally ! Look at this ! You shrunk my favorite pants !

I think somebody 's getting a spare tire . Forget it , Mary . It 's a little late to try to buy my affection with gifts . I meant you 've gained weight . Why should I be concerned about gaining weight ? My body is just the vehicle that carries my brain around , and my brain deserves a smooth , luxurious ride . Ok , Dick . Get fat . I don 't care . Well , I don 't care if you do care . As if I cared that you didn 't care that I cared . As if I cared that you do care if I care or not . I couldn 't care less if you care that I care ! Well , now , that was uncalled for ! Peanut brittle ? You know , Dr. Solomon , sometimes when there are changes in your life , you use eating as a way of filling that void . Changes ? Well , nothing has changed in my life . Well , except for the fact that Mary and I are no longer ... romping lustfully in pastures of delight , our writhing bodies eternally entwined , glistening like the morning dew . Bingo . Oh , poppycock ! You don 't see Mary gaining weight , and she 's lost a lot more than I have ! She lost me !

Well , thanks a lot ! Oh , Dick , just be thankful you 're a man . You know , I mean , you guys can get away with it . You don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , don 't I ? You know , the only time a woman is allowed to get fat is when she 's pregnant , but she can 't even enjoy it because she 's barfing all the time and her boobs are turning into a restaurant . But men can balloon up to the size of a Volkswagen and still get dates . Well , that 's great ! Oh , not you , Dick . You 're sloppy fat . Oh , all right , fine . So what if I have put on a little weight ? Big deal . I can lose it . I 'm the high commander of this body . I 'll just order it to stop eating . No , Dick . It 's an earth body , Ok ?

Not that . This . " Suzanne somers reveals her secret summer slimming tips . " I want to know ! So , um ... how 's your diet going , Dr. Solomon ? Oh , it 's not just a diet , Nina . It 's a complete lifestyle change . Sally just signed me up for a step class , and I 'm drinking 8 16-ounce glasses of water a day , and I can eat all the grapefruit I like . I suppose you have to diet when you don 't have the willpower to simply eat right . Mmm . You wouldn 't believe how delicious this grapefruit is . Would either of you like a taste ? No , thanks . That 's all right . Can I taste yours ? You know , Dick , if you 're too weak to be in the same room with pizza , Nina and I can go in her office . Oh , no , no , no . That--that 's not necessary . I 'll give you a whole grapefruit for just one pepperoni ! Let 's go . No ! Uh ... uh ... how about 2 ? 2 grapefruits ! 2 delicious grapefruits ! And my watch ! Hey , you thirsty ? Oh , I know you . You wouldn 't say anything if you were . That 's what I like about you , you know . You 're not rude or demanding like most people I know . You must be bored out of your mind . No . Not at all . I was talking to the plant . Well , Tommy , I 've got the evidence right here . Whup ! But I have to warn you , kid . You might not like what you see . Harry ... all these pictures are overexposed !

I couldn 't be better . ooh ! Oh ! Harry ? I 'm not Harry . Um ... what are you doing with the camera ? What camera ? Put down the ribs and step away from the platter . No . Ok , then . But make no mistake- - if you take one bite out of that , you 're gonna hate yourself more than you already do . Are you prepared to face those consequences , soldier ? ! You 're pathetic . Oh , I know ! You know , Nina was right . I do have a gaping hole inside of me , but it 's not my fault ! It 's this body ! It has a stupid design flaw . It thinks it can fill an emotional void with food ! God . Come on , Jeremy . You named it Jeremy ? I was gonna call him lycopersicon esculentum , but it sounded kinda snotty . Come on , Harry . I see . So suddenly it 's a crime for a grown man to hang around the high school taking pictures of the young girls . Whatcha eating ' there , Dick ? Ribs . Fat-free ribs ? Oh , shut up ! My diet is dead . Oh . Diet , huh ? Must be rough . Lucky for me , I was blessed with a high metabolism . Well thanks for the ride Don . Hold it there , Harry . I can only release you into the custody of a family member . Well , I 'm right here . Not you . Where 's Sally ? She 's in the other room . Is she alone ? Well , she 's with Jeremy . Jeremy . Well , it 's like she 's obsessed . You got any more hot sauce ? Can I have a rib ? No ! No ! Dr. Solomon- - not now . I 'm working . Oh , my god ! What is all this stuff ? It 's not mine ! Oh ! It 's those damned raccoons ! They have little hands , you know . You 're really worrying me . Oh , I don 't know what you 're talking about . Look at yourself . No ! Look at yourself . Who am I kidding ? I 'm huge ! Oh , Nina ! I 'm doomed- - doomed to a life of forlorn pudgery . I 'm gonna be referred to as " husky " and " jolly . " People will nickname me " tiny , " and they 'll laugh and throw rotten fruit at my rear as I pass them in the streets ! Nobody does that . Well , I do . Oh , Nina , I need help ! Good . Dr , Solomon , admitting you need help is half the battle . The other half wouldn 't happen to be a cherry cheesecake , would it ? No Dick it 's not . Huh . Well , it should be . Tommy ! This time I 've got good news . What is it ? August is cheating on you . Darrin laskey . Yeah . Harry , how is this good news ? Oh , well , look how happy he is . What 's that , Dick ?

Ben jerry ... and the Pillsbury doughboy ! Dick , please . August . Are you cheating on me ? What ? Harry saw you kissing Darrin laskey . Darrin laskey . He 's in my drama class . We were doing a scene together . A scene ? Oh . Oh , my god . I must look like such an idiot . You were doing a scene ? What a fool I am . That Harry , he 's- - hey , August . And Kevin Douglas . You must be in drama class , too . So you 're quite a little actress there , August . So you two are just rehearsing away . It 's very convincing . I 'd--I 'd pay to see something like this . So , now , tell me , Kevin , so you 're , uh ... you 're , uh ... you 're ... kissing ... your new girlfriend , aren 't you ? Can you give me a minute ? Right . August , how could you do this to me ? Me do this to you ? What kind of a boyfriend are you ? You--you lust after our music teacher . You flirt with that sleazy Lorna . Ok , but in all fairness , they both totally blew me off . Mary . Don 't talk to me . You lost the right to embarrass me in public when we stopped dating . I forgive you , Mary . You 're forgiving me ? For what ? For how you deceived me ... how you led me to believe you were unaffected by our breakup , when in fact , you were a hungry , frightened little ballerina careening out of control at 80 miles an hour . For your information , my eating had nothing to do with you . That 's what you 'd like me to think , isn 't it ? I don 't care what you think . You do , too . I do not . Do , too . Do not . Too ! Not ! Why don 't you just admit that you 've been eating because you missed me ? Why don 't you just admit that you 've been eating because you missed me ? ! Because I don 't miss you !

I 'm sorry to hear it . Well , Dick , your salad 's ready . I hope you like it . Salad ? Little guys never knew what hit ' em . Who wants salad ? I want some real food ! I cannot believe how insensitive you ar .. Shh ! Listen ! Mr. Frosty smooth ! Mr. Frosty smooth ! He 's right on time ! 3 : 46 on the dot . It was the end of a long day , and all I wanted to do was sit back , have a drink , and think about love 's fury . I knew the dame was trouble the minute she walked in the door . Did you drink all the milk again , you idiot ? ! Go back to bed ! My gut told me things were about to go from bad to worse . I hate it when I 'm right .

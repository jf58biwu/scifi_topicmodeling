 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman . [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts , and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! No heart of gold- - just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive ! Alive ! [ BELL RINGS ] Now let 's get ready to rumble ! In this corner , hailing from Lancaster , PA , and weighing in at 21 stone , Zebediah Schmitt , the Amish Avenger ! Yeah ! And his opponent , straight from St. Peter 's Basilica , weighing in at a divine 305 pounds , the Monsignor of Mayhem , Cardinal Carnage ! [ BOOING ] Let 's roll . Stay clean , stay clean . I 'm glad you asked us along , Chett . This is fun . Fun ? You call two guys beating each other into bloody pulps fun ? This is the legacy of the Roman gladiator . Noble combat between honor of the warriors . I guess the grant just sort of went over my head . Come on , Zebediah ! Bite his ass again . ANNOUNCER : Cardinal Carnage is feeling all of that one . These seats suck . What do you mean ? They 're ringside . Best seats Daddy Donnelly 's platinum card could buy . Well , maybe I 'd enjoy it more if I wasn 't six freaking inches tall . Shh . Chett 'll hear you . Hey , stop poking me . Your nipples are like hubcaps . Sorry It 's cold in here . CHETT : Carnage is a wussy ! Carnage is a wussy ! Carnage is a wussy ! Carnage is a wussy ! Carnage is a wussy ! Carnage is a wussy ! Carnage is- - a wussy . Shut up , you little stinking puke . Who 's gonna make me , altar boy . Chett , shut up ! Lighten up , sis . This is what wrestling is all about . We heckle them , they yell back at us . It 's all in good fun . Hey , didn 't I see you at the Michael Bolton concert ? He 's done . Chett , no . Do something . He 's going to get killed . Well , if that 's the case- - [ ZAPPING ] Dibs on his seat . Is something funny , you wafer-eating pantywaist ? Now , it 's my turn . ANNOUNCER : Oh , my God ! Carnage just decked a fan into the ring . This moron 's going to get maimed . Blood , blood , blood ! You know , he is gonna get killed if we don 't do something . Blood , blood , blood , blood ! OK , let 's make it a fair fight . [ ZAPPING ] Oops . I got Wyatt , too . ANNOUNCER : Oh , my God ! He 's got Cardinal Carnage is a scissor lock . Who is this mystery fan ? Whoa , was that me ? Put him on , Chett ! You turned them both into wrestlers ? They each got half the spell . But as long as they 're together , they can 't be beat . Oh , you know that 's going to leave a mark . ANNOUNCER : Unbelievable ! These two scrawny nobodies have come out of nowhere to defeat Cardinal Carnage . Did we just do all this ? What the hell is going on ? I don 't know , but I like it . These guys are great . Thank you , thank you . Very , very flattered . I can 't believe two little guys like you took out Cardinal Carnage . Well , he had it coming . A man shouldn 't make fun of another man 's musical preferences . Welp . Come here , you two guys . Huh ? Come here . Friend of yours , sis ? Pauly Spaccino , World Wrestling Federation . I want to sign you two , boys . You got a raw talent like I 've never seen before . You two guys- - you 're going to be big . You 're even going to be bigger than that Disney flick with the farting warthog . Look , Mr. Spaccino , me and my brother aren 't wrestlers . You two guys are brothers ? That 's great . That 's great . All right , let me think . Let me think . Hey , how 's this ? How 's this ? Mama 's Little Psychos ? Huh ? Don 't like the psycho bit ? OK , I 've got other ideas . All right , let me bounce around a couple of names here , all right ? How about Slash and Burn ? Rough and Tumble ? Blue Cross and Blue Shield ? Any of these fog up your windshields yet ? No . I 'm out of here . But this is our big chance . Come on , Wyatt . Please . Wyatt ? Since when do you call me Wyatt ? Whatever happened to Pit Lick and Marble Bag ? Pit Lick and Marble Bag ! I like it ! That 's great ! Would you please give it a rest ? You 're right . You 're right , you 're right , you 're right . Big decisions . I 'll just leave you and your brother to wrestle it out amongst yourselves . Huh ? Get it ? I love you guys . You 're gonna be big stars . Take it from me . Look , bro , obviously our family has this incredible gift for wrestling that we never knew about . Come on . We 're brothers . I 'm Uncle Slam ! And I 'm Paul Severe . Together , we 're the Yankee Dudes ! And the Meat Market Boys better watch out because Paul Severe 's taking a midnight ride on their spines ! And remember , Meat Market Boys , Saturday night at the Garden , Uncle Slam wants you ! [ GRUNTING ] And cut ! That was beautiful . Are these tights to clingy ? Excuse me . I 'm King Kong Bundy , and I was wondering , if you weren 't busy , you wouldn 't mind stepping out with me this evening . Oh , darn , boy . I mean , just look at you . What girl wouldn 't it 's just tonight I have my meeting . What meeting ? Children of Parents . It 's a big group , and they 're expecting me to bring the potato salad . OK . Rain check ? Yeah , that sounds great . Bye . ANNOUNCER : What a drop by Uncle Slam . The Irish Assassin is out of the ring . Looks like Paul Severe 's about to unleash his patented finishing move , The Patriot Missile . Some match , huh ? Nice moves out there . I think you broke The Sphinx 's nose . Well , he grabbed me by my tights You 've got to love a job where you get paid to moon a crowd of thousands . They saw my butt ? Just the top . Pre-crack , no pimples . Hey , Chett . This past couple of weeks has been- - Mm-hmm ? And , uh , well , you know . Yeah ? And you . [ MUTTERING ] That needed to be said . Oh , yeah . You have hung your tights on my locker . So ? It 's only a locker . It 's not like I took a whiz in it . We Germans do not appreciate the jokes about the vizzing . Look , remove the tights , wipe off the cooties , and , uh , presto . Good as new . You have not wiped off all the cooties . What do you want from us ? I would like to remove his head from his shoulders . Shove my fist in his cranial socket and make a ghastly hand puppet . Yeah ? Would you like me to show you what I 'm going to do with my little hand ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . This is beautiful . This is beautiful . I 've been wanting to introduce you three guys . Gentlemen , this is Der Blitzkreigar . He 's the federation 's singles champ . This is the guy who put Bobby " The Cuisinart " Mencia in that electric wheelchair . Yeah , well , maybe someday we 'll meet in the ring . Maybe someday soon . One , two , three ! [ BELL RINGS ] One , two , three ! [ BELL RINGS ] We have winners ! Ladies ! Wyatt , Chett ! Let those other girls have the beefcake . You 've always been my favorite . I have ? Uh-huh . Can I have your autograph ? Sure . Anything for a beautiful fan . Oh . I thought you were Screech . This wish bites . Everything 's Chett and Wyatt , Chett and Wyatt . Woo-hoo-hoo ! I can 't get a girl to notice me . I thought for sure this wrestling thing would get me in the saddle . Your problem is you 're trying to leech of somebody else 's fame . So ? Worked for all those Baldwin brothers . If you want to meet a girl , just be nice . Walk up and offer to take her out for ice cream . Girls love that . Make it Chunky Monkey . Girls really love Chunky Monkey . You just get weirder by the day , don 't you ? Here comes Chett . I better take off . Hi , Lisa . Oh , hi , King . I was wondering about that rain check . Tonight ? Oh , um- - That 's what I figured . Don 't worry , I understand . Why would a beautiful woman like you want to go for ice cream with a big lug like me ? Ice cream ? I was hoping . What 's your favorite flavor ? Mine 's Chunky Monkey . Mine too . Seconds ? Oh , my God . It 's happening . What ? Hanging out with wrestlers is finally paying off . I found a taker . I think I got a shot at taking the middle on a three-hour tour . Hi . Let 's get right to it . The name 's Gary , close personal friend of the undefeated Yankee Dudes . And look , no ring . Get it while it 's fresh . Ooh . But the real question is do you have experience ? You kidding ? I 'm a Barry White album with feet . Good . Because I 'd hate for you die a virgin . Meet my boyfriend . First , we put the peanuts in the grinder . Then , we shall make the peanut butter . That 'll go real well with the jelly I 'm going to make out of you . Thanks . Now get out of here , Wallace . Now , you want to mess with the little wimp , you got to go through me first . Yeah . First I break you . Then I use the spindly , effeminate one to floss your remains from my teeth . That was my beer . So now is it time that we shall fight ? Ya ? Ya indeed-e-doo-dah . Yo ! Take that to the ring . Good idea . You , me , in the ring after hours . No ref , no rules , and no partners . Like at the end of " Rocky II . " You could take him . Little bro , order me a cold one . I 'll be back after I tear down that Berlin Wall . He 'll be fine . He 's fighting with genie power . Yeah , he 's- - uh-oh . You know those little things that don 't seem important at the time so you never think to mention them . Things like what ? Oh , you know , things like Lisa saying the magic doesn 't work unless you and Chett are together . What are you telling me , Gary ? Chett 's defenseless against the condominium that kills ? Oh , man , you are about to meet a world of hurt , Blondie . You do not frighten me , little man . We Germans are trained in the discipline of [ SPEAKING GERMAN ] With each one 's private parts are repeated pummeled until all pain becomes insignificant . Oh , yeah ? Well , Debbie Lomansky did that to me in the third grade . I didn 't even tell the teacher . You attempt to lull me into false security . Convince me I am fighting a spastic . Do you think I could just have a minute to warm up ? Ya . Indeed-e-doo-dah . Oh , you 're so sweet . Well , you know . You think maybe after this bowl we could go for a walk on the beach or something ? I 'm sorry . Did you say something ? You Americans- - you make me sick with your girly dancing exercises . Everything always sweating to the oldies . Work those abba-dabbas . In Germany , we lift heavy objects . Yeah , well , at least we didn 't take it like a pooch in two world wars . The time for stalling has passed . [ LOUD SLURPING ] You heard the man before . No partners . I don 't have time for this . Give me one extremely good reason why I shouldn 't crush you like a crouton . OK , I 'll level with you . We have this magic genie who grants us wishes , and she gave Chett and me these cool wrestling powers , but they only work when we 're together . So my brother 's going to end up in a body cast if I can 't get in there and activate the magic . Oh . Go on , then . I had a magic genie once . [ SCREAMING ] Thought you could use an assist . Good to see you , bro . They got their powers back . Psych ! All right . Nothing stops the Donnelly brothers when they work as a team . Except the spell wearing off . Chett , trust me . Run ! Uh , Lisa , there 's something I want to say . I think you 're beautiful and sexy , graceful and sweet . But you eat like a pig . Huh ? No offense , but , I 've got my standards . Another round . [ WHISTLES ] MAN : Here you go , Blitzkriegar . Eenie , meanie , miney- - ah ! ALL ( CHANTING ) : Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! Dudes ! We did good . Sure did , tough guy . Ow ! You little bastard . Hey , hey ! Guys , stop it . Stop it . Break it up , break it up . Break it up . Break it up . Broke All right . We call it a draw . [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from your hip , something different , we 're making weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ?

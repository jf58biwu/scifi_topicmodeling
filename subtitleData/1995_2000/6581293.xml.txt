Houston , Excursion . Deploying Rover Two . We confirm Rover Two 's telemetry is " go " for deploy . Excursion , this is Houston . Are you receiving Rover One 's carrier signal through the Lender 's uplink ? That 's affirm , Houston . We expect excellent video from Rover One . Not for one nation ... not for one people ... not for one creed ... but for all humankind . [ Applause ] [ Cheering ] Patrick Ross , son of a senator , football star at Yale , and now the first man on Mars . A perfect hero for these imperfect times . Patrick , this is Excursion . I need you to check Rover Two 's next drilling site for me . [ Breathing ] Patrick , would you take a look at your primary 0-2 and power levels on your D.C.M. ? Suit parameters all look good . Structure around is loamy . Loose topsoil is rock . Drill bit shows signs of wear and tear . It 'll last . One more area . Sector 112 , okay ? It might have been a canal bed . PATRICK : Eight years of training , and I 'm a Martian ditchdigger . You have 1 hour , 30 minutes surface time left . And counting . PATRICK : Final sample loaded . Prepping for airlock ingress . In a world beset by violence , hunger and strife , there are occasions when mankind surpasses the petty struggles of daily existence . The Excursion voyage to Mars is one of those occasions . Today , America is proud . I told ' em not to go ! Three , two , one ... Let 's get you out of here . Oh , my God . It was incredible . A tremendous achievement that once again proves that if we can rise above partisan politics , America can climb to the heavens . Thank you , Mr. President . The credit goes to my crew . Fly home safe , son . Our prayers are with you and ... God bless you . Thank you , Mr. President . Flight Nav , we 'd like the crew to take a Star-Trekker pass and perform an I.M.U. alignment before we update the state vector . CAPCOM , let the crew know Navigation wants a fix on the star position and alignment of the interioral moment unit before putting a new state vector on board . Houston , this is Excursion . We have your new state vector on board . Excursion , Houston . We copy you . Have received the updated vector . Coming up on TIG for transfer orbit burn . Copy , Houston . Excursion , you are good to go . Thanks , Houston . Thirty seconds to transfer orbit TIG . We 're homeward-bound , baby ! Woo-hoo ! Yes , sirs ! Excursion , Houston . Transfer orbit burn in 20 , 19 ... [ Goop dripping ] 18 , 17 ... 16 , 15 ... 14 , 13 , 12 ... 11 , 10 ... 9 , 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... [ Goop launching itself ] Excursion , this is Houston calling . Do you read us ? Over . Excursion , this is Houston . Do you copy ? For the past three minutes , every attempt to communicate with the Excursion has failed . I told ' em not to go ... I told ' em not to go to Mars ! [ TV exploding ] I told ' em not to go ... ! G.C. Flight . Check all relay stations on the network . Have the backup TDRS on standby . Flight to all operators . Pull up your data passes from the burn . Get with your back rooms . Verify that we saw no anomalies . For God 's sake , somebody tell me she didn 't blow . Houston , this is Excursion . We had a malfunction in the K.U. band antenna . Lost telemetry and comm . I performed a bit of I.F.M. Seems to be okay now . Excursion crew is okay . Headed for rendezvous with Big Blue . It 's going to be good to get home . Over and out . WOMAN : The Extraterrestrial Vulnerability Experiment has one central goal : to discover a means to defend ourselves against the alien species , should they ever return to Earth . Now , as you know , gentlemen , Eve was re-created from a frozen lab embryo . She 's a genetic duplicate of the original Sil . Now , we have deliberately shielded Eve from any direct contact with the male gender , which is why , gentlemen , you 're inside there . So ... Proceed . [ Breathing heavily ] Help ! Help ... Help ! Laura ! Please ! [ Breathing heavily ] DR. BAKER : Okay , that 's enough ! Bring her up ! [ Breathing heavily ] Bingo , Dr. Baker ! It worked ! Take a look at those beautiful welts . Just beautiful , beautiful ! [ Chuckles ] What happened , Dr. Baker ? Our problem , in a nutshell : A toxic agent works once , but then it becomes useless once the alien 's biology adapts . You 've gone out of your way to give this ... this lab animal ... a living situation that 's fit for a queen ! I suggest you spend more time finding a way to 86 the damn thing . Colonel , you 're welcome to replace me any time you like . I 'm sorry , gentlemen . Tell Dr. Baker we must continue testing . AYE , aye , sir . Why do you do this to me ? I 'm sorry , Eve . I 've explained to you why we 've got to do this ; what happened with the first Sil . And why you have to be prepared . Survival of the fittest . I know . EVE : I watch this TV ... and I see all the places I 'm never gonna go ... and see all the people I 'm never gonna meet . Is that all I am to you ? A laboratory animal ? I want you to understand that the reason I took this job was to make sure that these experiments were done with regard for you . Just don 't forget that I 'm human , too . Main gear touchdown . Shuttle ground support vehicles with flight surgeon and medical team in the crew-recovery vehicle are en route . Thanks , Houston . It 's good to be home . - Thanks . - You 're welcome . On preliminary examination , all three of you are in remarkable health . Though , of course , I 'll continue more specific blood testing . We do have a few people here who would like a further examination . [ Cheering ] Whoo ! Boy , there 's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me . You 're under quarantine , Mr. Gamble . No sexual activity for at least ten days . - And that means all of you . - Oh , you 've gotta be kidding . No , I 'm not kidding . [ Applause , whistling ] Back when President Kennedy began the Space Program , I was just a very young assistant up on the Hill . It didn 't take me long to realize that he was a visionary ... and that I shared that vision . Later on , when I became a senator , I was determined to push our program even further into space . And so today , Jack Kennedy 's vision is maintained by the commitment of American business . But I like to think that his spirit is embodied in young men like Patrick Ross . When Patrick was four or five years old ... What happened to Patrick ? I don 't know , but he 's missing some major butt-kissing from his own father . He hasn 't been feeling very well tonight . Tell you the truth , I haven 't been feeling so great either . Yeah , I think what we all need is a little tender loving care . Mhm ... Mhm ... So it 's with great deal of pleasure that I introduce one of our finest young leaders , the captain of the Mars mission , and my son , Patrick Ross . Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! I 've gotta go . Lincoln suite , upstairs . Hurry . [ Applause ] ALL : Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Patrick ! Captain Ross , everyone 's waiting . This way , sir . Nice of you to show up , son . [ Cheering ] MAN : Yeah ! MAN : Yeah ! Thank you , all , for coming out this evening . Thank you , Father , for what I 'm sure were overly-kind words . I 've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew to represent the mission to Mars , and an image that comes to my mind is looking through the porthole ... at the blue-white globe ... beautiful ... so fragile , so small . And I thought to myself how easy it would be to destroy all that God has created . I think , as we look to the future , our greatest mission might be right here at home . [ Doorbell rings ] WOMAN : It 's open . Come on in . My sister decided to join us . We share everything together . [ Crowd cheers ] Parker 's going for two . Oh , he 's hanging in there , standing ! [ Monitor beeping ] Pulse rate is 20 percent below human norm . What do you expect , Brea ? She 's watching baseball . [ Grunts ] [ Moaning ] Oh , God ! You are a hero . [ Sighs ] Oh , God . It 's my turn . Yes , it is . Ahh ... [ Grunts ] [ Ecstatic cries ] Oh ! Oh ! Here it comes ! Parker 's going for three ! [ Breathing heavily ] Jeez ! Did someone hit a home run ? Ah ! [ Moaning ] [ Screaming ] Ahh ! MY God , help me ! Get off me ! [ Ball crunching ] Marcy ! Get him off me ! Oh , my God ! Help me ! [ Screaming ] Help me , someone ! Help ! [ Alien baby crying ] - What the hell is going on ? - My God ! [ Crickets chirping ] [ Door creaking open ] Last night , after the fundraiser ... something happened . I try to think about it , I draw a total blank . They always make those drinks at those fundraisers strong . The way they get the wallets to open up . Billy , you tell that old son-of-a-bitch I won 't take no for an answer . There 's something wrong with me , Dad ... since I got back . Do you think a trip to Mars was rough ? You just wait till you try a senate campaign . Dad , listen to me . I 'm having ... I 'm having some kind of breakdown . Stop thinking about the master plan and help me , all right ? I 'm scared . Goddamnit ! Quit acting like a spoiled child ! You 're a Ross . Behave like one . And I 'm gonna give you a piece of advice , boy . You keep your dick in your pants , and your eyes on the prize . Oh , I know what you been doin ' . And , frankly , I don 't give a damn . Dad , but - - But I have seen too many young men with promising careers piss it all away on a piece of ass . People love you , Patrick . Hell , boy , they idolize you . You 're gonna be President of the United States someday . Now , let 's take a walk through the gallery . Some of my illustrious colleagues are just dyin ' to get your autograph . Yes , sir . Yes , it 's very important that I speak with Herman Cromwell . No , he 's a patient there . Well , can I get a message to him that Dr. Orinsky called from the lab at Oldham Space Center up in Maryland ? Yes , it 's very , very important that I speak to him . I 'm an old colleague of his . I can 't believe this . Oh ! my GOG " No ! [ Screaming ] [ Helicopter whirring ] Company , halt ! Left , left ... The substance found in Dr. Orinsky 's wounds is combinant alien-human DNA . This DNA is structurally similar to Eve 's , but it 's not a perfect match . Obviously , Eve has not left the compound , which means , gentlemen , that there 's another one out there . None of our intelligence suggests that a foreign power was involved . How do we start looking for this thing ? Well , I would suggest normal investigative procedure to cultivate a list of possible suspects , and then test their blood . Thank you , Dr. Baker . We may ask you to help us track it down . Always a pleasure , gentlemen . Get Press Lennox . [ Shouting ] Ladies and gentlemen , the embassy is secure . The hostages are free . Press Lennox ... Diplomatic Security provides embassy guards , protects against kidnapping ... assassination , and also , of course , special services , like the demonstration we witnessed here today . Excuse me , Mr. Lennox . He needs to see you right away . My assistant will answer any questions you might have . Thank you all very much . Ladies and gentlemen , are there any questions I can answer ? Are you equipped with night-vision attack capabilities ? [ Applauding ] That was really , really great . Well ? The answer is no . Press , we got another fucking alien on the loose . Get somebody else . Come on , buddy . Your country calls . Don 't start waving the flag . I 'm in the private sector now . I got a business to run . Look at me , Press . You know how I got this goddamn eye . It 's a sacrifice I 'd make again in a heartbeat . But then maybe ... you haven 't learned the meaning of sacrifice . Listen , pal . The last time I fought with that alien she-bitch , I almost got myself killed . If the government was stupid enough to make another one ... I think they can clean up the mess by themselves . We didn 't make this one . Count me out of the search party , okay ? Where is my fucking key ? A million dollars , tax-free . Sure you won 't reconsider ? [ Alarm sounds ] Welcome to Biohazard 4 . Dr. Baker ! Dr. Baker ! Come out here , Dr. Baker ! Oh , my God . LAURA : Open the door ! Somebody , open the door ! Get him away from there ! Somebody open the door ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? You know there 's no men allowed in this lab ! Get away ! Calm down , Dr. Baker . Do you have any respect for what we 're trying to do here ? Out , now , both of you ! Now ! - We have an emergency . - Now ! Okay , okay , we 'll take it outside . Damn well right , you 'll take it outside . - Don 't blow a gasket , Doctor ! - Don 't patronize me , either . We 're not patronizing . We 're coming along . Close the doors . Laura , correct me if I 'm wrong . Are you involved in this crazy bullshit ? Dr. Baker runs this facility . She cloned the Sil embryo . Oh . Okay , well , what should I call her ? " Sil Lite " ? - Her name is Eve . - Eve . How very biblical . We have dampened her mating instinct . We have strictly avoided the presence of testosterone in this lab ... At least , until now . Thank you for your help in that area , Colonel . What if she gets out of there , huh ? She 's electronically tethered to a control box . One step off the premises , and a toxic capsule explodes in her brain . You know , it 's really great to see you again . And I was hoping we 'd meet under better circumstances ... but I remember Laura Baker having a little bit more soul . Just who the hell do you think you are ? You 're coming into my lab , questioning my motives ! Are you two finished ? We have a national fucking emergency on our hands ! Now , you two will work together . That 's a direct order from the Pentagon . You killed one of these fucking alien things before . Do it again . You heard the man . Now the fun begins . PRESS : Listen , I went over Orinsky 's phone records , and this is the last place he called . I cross-checked all the patients , and I came up with one named Herman Cromwell . Turns out he taught Orinsky at Stanford . LAURA : And what exactly is Cromwell doing here ? Well , that 's the interesting part . It 's classified " top-secret information . " I was doing research on a Mars meteorite . The one found in the Antarctic in ' 96 ? Fossils in the meteorite convinced us there might have been life on Mars . But these fossils weren 't anything organic to the planet . Oh , no , no no . And what was the basis for that determination ? Carbon-based elements in the fossils exist only in the Magellanic Galaxy . That 's 100 million light years away . Well , how did they get to Mars ? By my reckoning ... Mars was visited by an alien species approximately one billion years ago . The species was like a plague , a cancer . It turned a thriving planet with rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life into a useless hunk of rock . When I heard they were going to send a mission to Mars , I strongly urged the government to reconsider . On what grounds ? On grounds that alien DNA might remain on the planet . That any human attempt to violate the planet would result in biological contamination . So , let me guess . They told you to shove it up your ass . They got me fired from Stanford . It seems the military had strategic reasons for wanting to go to Mars . Outpost of the future , or some crap like that . Anyway , they harassed the shit out of me . I got into a fistfight with a Pentagon general ... and broke his goddamn jaw . That 's why they stuck you in here , right ? Why do you think that Dr. Orinsky called you the night that he died ? To tell me I was right . Whatever species destroyed Mars those poor astronauts brought down to Earth . May God have pity on our souls . UNCLE JESSE : I 'll tell you one thing , for General Lee to be heating up the road this early in the morning , something sure got Bo and Luke all heat 'd up . I figure it 's got something to do with women . Or hunting ' . Or maybe wheels . LAURA : The temperature on Mars is approximately 225 degrees below zero . If they brought the samples on board , the temperature thaw could have brought the DNA back to life . That DNA could have infected the astronauts . This isn 't the fucking " X-Files " , goddamn it ! You are following a lead based on the interrogation of a certified nutcase ! We got one dead N.S.E.G. doctor , we have a guy who warned the government not to go to Mars , they slapped him in a loony bin ... and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight . We need to do blood analysis on Sampas , Gamble and Ross . Now , I know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days on all interplanetary missions , and the Mars quarantine ends tonight . They could fuck the human race into extinction . You want to be responsible for that if we don 't start testing everybody right away ? Test Patrick first . Yeah ... yeah . I 've been waiting to get you alone . All the interviews , all the screaming girls ... all the hoopla ... In-gone . Push it out of your mind . Patrick Ross ... tonight ... you 're mine . I love you . What 's the matter ? I don 't know . We should hold off . Oh , no . No , you don 't . Not tonight . Come on , Melissa , I don 't feel so good . Shhh ... Relax . Let me do the work . [ Door busting in ] There 's nobody here . Where the fuck did he go ? Let 's go find the others . I missed you up there . I missed you so much . It 's so beautiful . Not as beautiful as you are . Charmer . Take it easy , Press ! You 're gonna get us killed ! Trust me , Laura . I got a bad feeling in my stomach . God , I missed making love with you . Oh , my stomach ! - Oh , my God ! - Call someone ! Mike ! Call for help ! Call for help ! Up here ! Come on ! No ! No , please ! No ! Oh , God ! I 'm gonna get a full crew . I 'm gonna get ' em over here right away . We gotta get to the others . Oh , this is awful . This is just awful . Ah ! I 'll take her the rest of the way , chief ! Have a good evening . - This is nice . - Whoo ! See , you thought a brother lived on a tugboat . I know what you thought . But I got it all under control now . Oh , you do ? Yeah , you just slide right over there . Let me open this door . There we go . Hey , girl . [ Moans of anticipation ] - Is that it ? - No , honey , that 's not it . - Right there . - No , that 's not it . Oh , that 's it ... [ Breathing heavily ] What 's wrong ? Dennis Gamble , we 'd like you to come with us . Shit , a brother just can 't get no booty . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? This is no way to treat a national hero . This is embarrassing . What is this all about ? Look , somebody speak to me . Hey , hey , hey ! I 'm a personal friend of Senator Judson Ross , okay ? Personal friend . I 'm gonna eat your badge for breakfast . Get your hand off my head , man . I demand an explanation . We 'll have the test results in a few minutes . Why am I being tested ? N.S.E.G. said I was fine . Sit tight , son . We 'll explain everything later . Well , it 's kind of tough to sit tight , sir . I haven 't been laid in 11 months . That 's unusual for me . Take it easy , Burgess . Everybody deserves an explanation . You 're damn right . And what 's with all these guards ? What the hell is going on around here ? It 's purely a precautionary measure . We need a couple of minutes for this computer to analyze your blood , so just relax . Couple of questions ... What can you tell us about the seven minutes when the Excursion lost contact with Earth ? I can 't remember . I don 't know if I blacked out or what , but I just can 't remember that . When did you last speak to Anne Sampas ? At that fundraiser the other night . Did she act peculiar ? No , she seemed fine to me . I mean , what 's this all about ? What , something happen to her ? You tell me . What happened to Anne Sampas ? Tell me ! What happened to Anne Sampas ? Anne Sampas is dead . I 'm sorry , Dennis . [ Phone rings ] Yeah . Laura . Well , the combinant DNA in Anne 's body doesn 't match what I found in Orinsky 's . So , it 's either Gamble or Ross . Be careful , Press . What was the cause of death ? We don 't know . Come on , man . How the hell did she die ? Sequence almost complete . - Why are you testing my blood ? - Ten seconds till relay . - You think I killed Annie ? - Data retrieval online . - Is that what you think ? - Five seconds ... Three seconds . I didn 't kill her ! I swear ! [ Guns cocked ] POLICE : Freeze ! Computer says normal , normal , normal . There is no sign of infection . - Go home , get some rest . - I want answers ! In due time . We 'll be in touch . Yo , Gamble . You know where Patrick Ross is ? Nope . Well , if you see him , you 'll let me know , yeah ? Sure . Well , let 's see what the cranial cavity has to say . [ Drill screeching ] Now , I 'll just reach behind her ear , and we should ... [ Screaming ] God ... [ Gun cocking ] Patrick , no ! [ Gun going off ] [ Police sirens ] Want a date , mister ? [ Streetlife noise ] I was scared , man ! This is crazy ! His whole head just grew right back , like some sort of damn freak show . The alien species can regenerate living tissue . Aliens ... little green men . I still can 't believe it . If they knew there were aliens up there , why the hell they sent us ? N.S.E.G. got warned , but they chose to ignore it . We think that there was some hostile DNA in the soil samples that you collected . Wait a minute , something happened up there . I can 't remember exactly . I just know it was terrible . I 'm sure that it was terrible . The question is : How do we proceed now ? I got guys out there all over the place looking for this kid . Any place he might be . We 're gonna find him sooner or later . If he 's reproducing , we 've got potential offspring . I think it 's pretty safe to assume that he 's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time . Well , then , in less than two weeks , these offspring reach adolescence , and then they enter the chrysalis stage . Chrysalis stage ? A cocoon , which turns them into adults . Hey , baby , turn that car around . Hey , don 't leave me . Come on . Hi , honey . Baby , come back . A serial killer may be loose in the Washington-Maryland area . Authorities have asked the public to be extremely cautious when approached by strangers . Please beware . - How much for number three ? - Twenty an hour . NEWS ANCHOR : Thank you , Linda . And now for the financial news . Twenty , forty , sixty . Thank you much . Enjoy yourself . Come in . [ Breathing heavily ] See what I mean , Laura ? Every so often , her rates go berserk . Fifty agents we got out there looking for this guy . We got nothing . Man , how can you just touch that ? Occupational hazard . So , you didn 't see nothing , you didn 't hear nothing , you don 't know nothing . They come and they go , you know what I mean ? They come ... and they go . Oh , that 's hysterical . Now , why don 't you sit your ass down . - They come and go ... You get it ? - Oh , yeah , I get it . - Here you go . - Thanks . MANAGER : Aahh ! We 're wasting time . It 's been two days , and Lennox hasn 't made any headway . Maybe that 's because you gentlemen won 't allow us to go public . Dr. Baker , you said that Eve has telepathic abilities . Some . Can we send her after Patrick ? It 'd be foolish to take her out of a controlled atmosphere . There 's the danger of escape . And then we 've got two aliens running around , instead of one . And if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable . Well , can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab ? We 've seen spiking in her biorhythms , which indicate a rudimentary connection , but half her alien genes are dormant . Tracking Patrick is out of her league . Dormant means asleep . Is there any way that we can wake them up ? We could use the lab 's cyclotron to bombard her with radiation . That would awaken her dormant genes , but there is a problem . - What 's that ? - We make her more alien . We increase her strength , her anger ... Her mating drive would go through the roof . It 's worth the risk . We 'll tighten security . She is not a lab animal ! She is half-human . Please , Baker , spare us the alien rights agenda . Put her in the cyclotron . And what if I refuse ? That 's your prerogative . She 's gonna go in anyway . Gentlemen . Don 't worry , Laura . I know what they want . I 'm sorry . This is not what I intended . It 's gonna be very painful for you . I wanna help . Eve , I 'm going to radiate for 45 seconds , then shut it down . Okay - [ Cyclotron sounds ] [ Animalistic growls ] [ Heavy breathing ] What ... ? I 'm connected , Laura . I see what he sees . He 's driving down a small street . I see two-story buildings ... A man walking a small dog ... They 're stopping at a stoplight . Okay , okay , okay , here we go ! Here we go ! I see street signs . Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick ! - The intersection of Gwynn 's Falls- - - He 's crossed into a parking lot ! - What ? - LAURA : Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick . - Gwynn 's Falls ? - Where ? That 's in Reservoir Hill ! A supermarket , there 's a supermarket , a big supermarket ! A supermarket ! He 's going into the supermarket near Gwynn 's Falls and Warwick . Hang on to your shorts ! He 's going after a woman ! Yes , there 's a woman ! Let 's go ! [ Screaming ] How the hell did you get a driver 's license ? [ Sirens wailing ] Where is he , Eve ? Aisle one ... Fruits and Vegetables ! In aisle one ... Fruits and Vegetables . We 're there . Now what ? Come on , Press ! Let 's move ! My God ! It 's you ! - Will you sign my " Space Flakes " box ? - Sure . You got a pen ? I do . - What 's your name ? - Darlene . " Darlene . " You know a secret , Darlene ? I think " Space Flakes " taste like shit . - Which row ? - Cereal ! - Come on , Press . - Watch it ! Where 's the goddamn cereal ? - It 's nice to meet you . - Really nice to meet you . [ Distress cries ] - It 's her ! - Help me ! Which way ? Quick ! Which way ? What did she say ? They 're going down some stairs . They 're going down some stairs ! A basement ! Find a basement ! [ Muffled distress cries ] It 's dark . He wants to mate with her ! Stop it ! Get away from me ! Get up ! - Shut up ! - Help ! Get down ! Get down ! - Damn it ! - No ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! He 's trying to rape her . Man , don 't shoot ! Why don 't you get a motel ? Fuckin ' kids . He knows I 'm tapping in . Help ! Leave me alone ! Stop ! Get off me ! Eve-- - Patrick . Go on ! Get out of here ! Get out ! - Hey ! Don 't move , spaceman . - Put down the gun . Get your hands up ! Get ' em up ! What the hell is this , Dennis ? You can 't deny some bugged-out stuff going on around here . What kind of stuff ? Look , you told me yourself you were feeling weird . You gotta go in for tests , bro . Okay ... Sure , I don 't mind going into the lab . [ Beeping ] Open the gate ' . ! What the hell is going on ? Estrogen level 's peaking . It 's like she 's in heat . Let me out ! Let me out ! Let 's go . - Has she been given any medication ? - Yes , her usual close . Let me out , Laura ! I 'm going to double it . Let me out ! Listen to me , Laura ... Laura ! [ Screaming ] Code 459 alert . Patrick Ross in Biohazard Four . Seal the compound ! Get out of there , Sherry ! Get outta there ! Patrick , leave her alone ! Open the door . I know what you 're going through . And I can help you . - Let me help you . - Open the goddamn door ! I can 't do that . I 'm sorry . - Open it ! - I can 't do that ... Get away from her ! Get away from her now ! [ Guard screaming ] The proof is incontrovertible . Your son was infected up in that capsule . I 'm sorry , Senator . Jesus God . Rest assured , we 'll deal with this quietly . Medical treatment , the best doctors . The last thing this country needs is a spectacle with a national hero being publicly compromised . Cut the crap , Carter . What the hell are we gonna do ? Two imperatives . We have to find Patrick and bring him in immediately . We have to neutralize any possibility that this situation could leak to the media . The generals are very concerned . They 're gonna kill him . Aren 't they , Carter ? We need to find your son . Now , you listen to me , you arrogant son-of-a-bitch . If you so much as touch a hair on his head , you will rue the clay you were born ! You make it very hard to help you , Senator . Go fuck yourself ! What the hell did you think I was gonna do ? Stand here and let you take my son ? I 'll call the goddamn President if I have to . Listen carefully , old man . This is way beyond the President . Way beyond . - Oh ? - You wanna save Patrick ? Help us bring him in . Damn , man ! What is up ? I can 't even get no play from an alien . Some people carry a disease in their genetic code . It doesn 't mean that they have the disease , but the possibility exists it might be passed on to their children . Well , those N.S.E.G. doctors told me I had sickle trait . Right , it 's in your chart . You don 't have sickle-cell anemia , which is why you were able to go to Mars , but you 're a carrier . Right . Well , I guess that 's why he didn 't get infected up on the ship . Right . The alien DNA cannot cope with human genetic flaws . It has no defense against our diseases , and that might be our answer . What could be the answer ? The alien DNA infected us . It 's about time we infected them . What ? Patrick ? Dad , what are you doing here ? Well , I kind of figured you 'd show up here . You always used to love this place as a child . So did your mother . I never could convince her to get rid of it . Yeah , I used to come here when I was courting her . - And after she died ... - What do you want ? Well ... First off , I 'd like to apologize . Apologize for what ? Oh , Paddy . Don 't bother . They told me what happened ... how you got infected up on Mars . I 'm sorry , Paddy ... for not listening when you asked for help . You never listened . I 'm listening now . They 're gonna kill me . Not if I can help it . Now , there 's no way that they can find you here . This property 's still listed under you mother 's maiden name .

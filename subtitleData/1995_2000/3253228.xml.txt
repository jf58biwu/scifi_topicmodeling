 Inertial dampers have failed . I can 't get any response from the field coils . Did you verify the control inputs ? Stand by . The inputs are blocked . We 've got to flush the plasma injectors . Or maybe it 's just a phase synchronization adjustment . - Plasma injectors . - Plasma injectors . Right . Field coils responding . Inertial dampers back on line . That was not fair ! As your flight instructor , it 's my duty to prepare you for anything , fair or not . Clogging someone 's plasma injectors is a dirty trick . Yes , well , I 'm famous for my dirty tricks , you know ? W-What was that ? I never said the simulation was finished . Computer , evasive maneuvers . I 'll be ready for anything next time . Oh , sounds like a challenge to me . Come in . I hope you have good news , Commander . Based on this inventory , our food reserves look to be down to 30 percent of capacity . Good news and bad . We have located an M-Class planet and it shows high amino acid and protein readings . That should indicate a healthy plant life . What 's bad about it ? It 's a full day out of our way . I don 't think we have any choice . It 's the first chance we 've had to replenish our supplies in weeks . And our long-range sensors can 't confirm any plant life on the surface . Why not ? It 's one strange planet , Captain . It 's shrouded . Vapors cover it like a curtain . EM disturbances all over the atmosphere . Some of these readings suggest a planet early in its evolution ... almost like a primeval Earth . The people in stellar cartography have already nicknamed it " Planet Hell . " So it might be a wild goose chase . Captain , I don 't know what we 'll find when we get to the surface ... flora or fauna , friend or foe . If we knew we 'd find another M-Class planet soon , I 'd ... Set a course for Planet Hell , Commander . That was you ? That was me . I 'm impressed . I keep hearing my mother say , " Practice , Harry , practice . " So I ate Neelix 's food for a week and used my replicator rations . Play something for me . Well , I 've only had it for a few days , and I don 't think ... Oh , come on ! Play something . Just pretend I 'm not here . Play something different . Different ? Something ... not so cheerful . Why ? What , you don 't take requests ? Something bothering you , Paris ? Oh , Harry . I 'm in trouble . What 's new ? I think I 'm in love . What 's new ? With Kes . Kes ? ! I know , I know ! I never even saw it coming . I thought we were just good buddies . But there she was , in my arms . In your arms ? Paris ... you didn 't . What ? Oh ! No . I didn 't . I wouldn 't ! She stumbled during a flight simulation . I caught her . I held her for an instant . Are you going to play or not ? A whole crew full of women and I have to fall for the one I can 't have . Why do I do this to myself ? If you ask me , I say you enjoy it . Enjoy it ? Only thing that makes sense . You 've been doing the same thing to yourself your whole life ... setting yourself up for rejection . You must enjoy playing the part . Hey , don 't knock it if you haven 't tried it . I just have to be more careful . I can 't let myself be alone with her . There 's an old Chinese expression ... " Stay out of harm 's way . " That 's not a Chinese expression . If it works , use it . Of course , it would help a little if Kes and I weren 't going to be stuck on the same ship for the rest of our lives . That 's a pessimistic view . I 'm in a pessimistic mood . Play something pessimistic . Practice , Harry , practice . And then suddenly , we fell into a subspace anomaly . None of the readings made any sense . I didn 't know what to do . It must have been terrible for you . Uh , pepper , sweeting ? Oh . Anyway , it was quite a learning experience . I 'm sure Lieutenant Paris is a fine teacher . Oh , I almost forgot , the Palliantyne peas . Uh ... Hmm . Ever so lightly spiced . Analysis . High levels of trigemic vapors , but it should still support humanoid life . Sick Bay to Bridge . Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel . I hope you don 't mind that I 've been eavesdropping , but I have something important to contribute . What is it , Doctor ? Of course , it wouldn 't be necessary for me to eavesdrop , if I were included in these discussions as a matter of operating protocol . Doctor ... You should be aware that trigemic vapors at the recorded levels can cause severe humanoid skin irritations . Could you provide some sort of skin protection that might help ? I am whipping up a batch of dermal osmotic sealant as we speak . Nevertheless , skin exposure to the atmosphere should be limited . Noted , Doctor . Thank you . Tell me , just how often do you ... eavesdrop ? I am simply trying to monitor issues involving the health of the crew , Captain . When activated , the emergency medical program establishes com-links with all key areas of the ship , and I have ... on occasion ... I am a doctor , not a voyeur . I am programmed to be discreet . I 'm sure . Commander Chakotay will discuss operating protocols with you at the earliest opportunity . In the meantime , no more eavesdropping , Doctor . - But , Captain , I ... - That 's an order . There 's another problem , Captain . We won 't be able to transport to the surface because of the EM disturbances in the atmosphere . They 'll interfere with our com-links , too . I 'll have Mr. Kim take a look . Listen , why don 't we take in a holodeck program later ? A Moli√©re comedy ... that 'll cheer you up . I think I 'll just eat later . Damn . What do you want to do ? Very simple . We just won 't sit with her . But that 's rude . No , that 's smart . We 'll make it look like we have Bridge operations to discuss . Gentlemen , may I recommend the Alfarian hair pasta today ? Hair pasta ? That is just an expression , isn 't it ? Not at all . It 's actually made from the follicles of the mature Alfarian . We harvest the hair during shedding season in early fall . It 's very high in protein . Whatever . We just have a lot of Bridge operations business to discuss . Yeah . Mr. Kim , please report to the Bridge . Have a nice lunch . You subclass genus . I beg your pardon . Sitting with your backs to each other like two strangers waiting for a transport . That 's supposed to fool me ? Oh . A guy just can 't win . Look , there is nothing to fool you about . Really . I swear . Liar . What the hell are you doing ? ! I 'll kill you ! It 's too late ! I 'm betting your hair pasta already did the trick ! Janeway to Lieutenant Paris and Mr. Neelix . Go ahead . Yes , Captain ? Please report to my ready room right away . I have something important to discuss with you . Uh , Captain , did you say " right away " ? If we could have ... That 's what I said , Mr. Paris . Janeway out . Would anyone care to explain ? It might be too long to go into right now , Captain . Very well . I have a mission for the two of you . We have reason to believe that there are food sources on this planet , but we can 't transport to the surface . You 're going to take a shuttle down and do a little scouting . M-M-Me ... and him ? He 's our best pilot and you 're our expert on edible plant species in this Quadrant . Uh , Captain , I 'm not one to pass up a mission , but in this circumstance , maybe Ensign Baytart , who is a fine pilot ... There are electromagnetic anomalies in the atmosphere and I would rather have you at the helm . Am I ... discerning a personal problem here , gentlemen ? Frankly , yes , Captain . Solve it . You leave at 1400 hours . We 're modifying the transporter to try and penetrate the atmosphere . So far no luck . However , we have been running computer simulations to determine if the EM disturbances follow any specific pattern . Our data analysis suggests that there may be occasional atmospheric windows that would allow us to get through . How occasional and how long will they last ? We should see one every 30 hours or so , but they may only last for a matter of minutes . I can 't be sure yet . At least long enough for us to beam up food supplies . Mr. Paris , you and Mr. Neelix will collect as many vegetables and fruits as you can while we wait for this atmospheric window to open . Mr. Kim , be sure your computer simulations include ... What happened ? I heard that you ... Nothing happened . They said that you and Tom Paris ... Kes , we 'll talk when I get back . I want to know . Neelix , is it true that you were fighting ? When I get back . But ... Shuttlebay . Good afternoon . When you have a chance , could you run an analysis of the cytokinetic results for ... I did it during lunch . Are you all right ? I 'm fine . Are you sure ? - You seem a little ... - I 'm fine . You know , if you skipped lunch , the result might be a lower blood sugar level , which could ... I 'm sorry . It 's in my program . I see something wrong , I must attempt to diagnose it . There are some things you can 't cure . Neelix and Tom Paris had a physical ... fight . Over me . How delightful . Delightful ? ! You should consider it a high compliment . Throughout history , men have fought over the love of a woman . Why , I can quote you autopsy reports from duels as far back as 1538 . That 's not funny . It 's not meant to be . You 've always been interested in autopsies . Are all Talaxians so jealous ? I wouldn 't know . I 've only met one . I love Neelix . Why can 't he just accept that ? His suspicions about Tom are completely unjustified . Are they ? Lieutenant Paris ' affection for you is obvious . What do you mean ? I mean he ... desires you . That 's not true . Tom and I enjoy each other 's company . We 're friends . Whenever you walk into the room , his respiration increases , his pupils dilate and the coloration of his ears turns decidedly orange . Until I noticed the pattern , I thought he was suffering from Tanzian flu . It 's there for anyone to see . Maybe not in the same diagnostic detail as I see it , yet ... Are you saying that I didn 't want to see it ? You 're only two years old . There may be a few things ... you don 't know to look for in a man . In time , you 'll understand . On my homeworld , it 's so much simpler . You choose a mate for life . There is no distrust , no jealously , no envy , no betrayal . Hmm , your world must have very dry literature . I don 't know how to handle something like this . What am I going to do ? You 've done nothing to precipitate this state of affairs . You may not be able to do much to resolve it either . There are some things you can 't cure . Entry sequence at two minutes . Mark . All systems normal . Trigemic density at .041 and rising . We lost communication with Voyager 30 seconds ago . You don 't have to impress me with your technobabble . I 'm not trying to impress anyone . I 'm entering it into the flight record . Look , can I make a suggestion ? You 're the commander of this mission . You can make any suggestion you want . And if you make it an order , I 'll even have to obey it . My suggestion is that we put our personal problems aside until this mission is over , okay ? I left my personal problems back on the ship . I can 't speak for you . Fine . Let 's get the job done . You get us down in one piece and I 'll take it from there . Entry sequence at three minutes . Mark . All systems ... Stand by . Have you been briefed on shuttle operations ? Ensign Baytart took me through the basics . Of course , I , I didn 't have the benefit of your personal tutelage . Check your console . I 'm reading a power-output decline of ... 15 percent . Confirmed . Warning . Vectored exhaust controls malfunctioning . What does that mean ? We 're getting some kind of reaction in our driver coil assembly from the EM anomalies in the atmosphere . I 'm going to abort the mission . Hold on . We 've lost our impulse drive ! Shut off the deuterium flow . I 'm dumping excess fuel . Deuterium flow sealed . Setting DCA pulse order to neutral . Engaging thrusters . Can you regain control ? I 'm trying , Neelix . Prepare for an emergency landing . Send out an EMS pulse . There 's still a chance Voyager will pick it up . Captain , we 're picking up a locator signal from the shuttle . Can you track it ? Their last velocity vector indicates a steep descent . We 've lost contact . Bridge to Torres . Torres here . B 'Elanna , our shuttle 's in trouble . Any progress on modifying the transporter ? Negative . It 's an extremely complex interference pattern and it keeps changing . Bring in as much help as you need . This is now a search and rescue operation . Acknowledged . Torres out . Keep me informed . I 'll be in my ready room . I said ... in one piece . Sorry . I did the best I could . Any broken bones ? Everything seems to be working . I 'm itching . I feel it , too . We 've got atmospheric leakage in the hull . The trigemic vapors really sting . Here . Doc said this would help a little . If we have atmospheric leakage , how can we fly out of here ? We can 't . We 'll have to wait for Voyager to find us . We 're not even sure they 're looking for us yet . We don 't know if the EMS pulse got through . B 'Elanna 's working on the transporter and one of those atmospheric windows might open up . In the meantime , we 're going to have to look for some kind of cover . I say we stay right here . The trigemic vapors are going to ... You 're the one who wants to go out into those vapors ! Staying here is our best chance of being found . You heard what they said . Those windows may only be open for a matter of minutes . And we may be waiting here for days . Exposure to these vapors is too dangerous . We 're leaving . Grab your gear . Is that an order or a suggestion ? An order ! Yes , sir . I hope you 're satisfied . We were a lot more comfortable inside the shuttle . I have red welts all over my hands now . You know , it might be more constructive if you could find us something safe to eat . I certainly don 't know why the ship 's sensors indicated this planet might be rich in food supplies . It sure doesn 't look it . Our emergency rations won 't last forever . I 'll find something for us . Of course , it might not meet your personal culinary standards . Oh , don 't worry . I 've learned to lower my standards since you became cook . I 'm picking up some caves about a kilometer west of here . What good fortune . Come in . Harry . Any word yet ? We 're doing everything possible . The transporter just doesn 't want to work in that atmosphere . How are you doing ? Oh , I 'm all right . It 's just , uh ... I was very angry at them a few hours ago . You had every right to be . And now they might both be dead . And I 'm sitting here ... and I 'm feeling guilty for some reason . Guilty ? Why ? I don 't know . But I don 't like it . And it 's their fault and I can 't even tell them how angry I am at them and I may never be able to tell them how angry I am at them ! So it doesn 't matter , does it ? Look , you know if there was any way to land that shuttle , Tom Paris got it down . And no one has stronger survival skills than Neelix . I 'm sure they 'll both be fine . Unless they kill each other . They 're professionals . They better be all right , because when I see them , I 'm personally going to tell them that I never intend to speak to either one of them again . Chakotay to crew . Battle stations . This is good . We can last a while in here . That should do it . Garnesite . This will give us a little heat at least . We better conserve our beacon cells . So ... what is Starfleet protocol for situations like this ? Oh , there 's a whole course at the Academy full of all sorts of survival strategies . I hope you had a passing grade . B-minus . That 's not very encouraging . My father was teaching the class that year . And he gave you a B-minus ? I guess he didn 't play favorites , huh ? What about Talaxian protocols ? I wrote my own book . My life before Voyager was no bed of Felaran rose petals . No , more like a bed of ... What ? Nothing . You were going to say " junk " perhaps ? Go ahead , say it ... junk . I was a dealer in junk . Perhaps not worthy of a woman like Kes in your opinion . Neelix , I didn 't say that . I never even ... Tell me something . In that Starfleet survival course , did your father teach you to check for life signs before you seal yourself inside a cave ? I checked for life signs . There weren 't any . There are now . Hail them . They do not respond , Captain . They 're powering down their weapon systems . The vessel has taken up a position directly beneath us . What do you make of it , Lieutenant ? They would seem to have adopted a defensive posture , Captain . I agree , but defending what ? The planet ? Or something on it . Whatever this life-form is ... its vital signs are awfully faint . In this atmosphere , it could be dying of exposure . No , I don 't think so . They 're faint ... but steady . I 'd say it 's becoming more and more evident that we chose the wrong cave . This is where the life signs are coming from . They 're embryonic life-forms . These two are half formed . This one almost seems to be ... The EM disturbance patterns match the computer simulations . I 'd say we 'll get a shot at an atmospheric window in about 53 minutes . Where does that leave us with the transporter ? Our range will still be limited , but the transporter should work as long as we stay in an area with reduced electromagnetic activity . The problem is , we don 't know where our shuttle went down . So there 's no way to know how close they 'll be to the window when it opens . Recommendations ? Take the ship through the window into the atmosphere . The closer you can get us to the surface , the better our chances for a successful beam-out . Get on it . Are you going to be able to warn us before the window closes again ? I think so . Mr. Kim , that 's not an answer I can live with . I 'll try to get you a better one , Captain . Mr. Tuvok , we need you to find a way to get us by that ship . I have anticipated your request , Captain . Am I correct in the assumption that you will want to use minimal force ? Assumption confirmed . I cannot guarantee success . My evaluation of their weapon systems suggests a capacity equal to our own . However ... You 've come up with an ingenious plan to neutralize them . I have . In my analysis of our first encounter , I have detected what I believe to be a vulnerability in their shield configuration . There appears to be a slight phase retraction when auxiliary power is transferred to their aft weapon systems . A covariant phaser pulse into their aft control systems might disable their entire weapons array . That was my ingenious plan , Commander . You are correct . Very well . Red Alert . Mr. Kim , set coordinates . Torres , speed at 2,000 kph . Aye , Captain . Chakotay , take the helm . Coordinates entered . Engage . This creature 's going to have the ability to stand upright . It has the skeletal system of a humanoid . It 's cold-blooded , has reptilian epidermis . Its brain is significantly larger than most reptilian species . I 'd say we 're dealing with a sentient life-form here , Neelix . If this species is sentient , wouldn 't that suggest that its parents might return to care for it ? It 's hard to say . Most common reptiles lay their eggs and never return to protect them . I think we 've established we 're not dealing with a common reptile . True . And if this thing does have a mother , I 'd say we don 't want to be around when she gets back . Come on . We can 't just leave it here . We 're not leaving it here . Its mother left it here . We just happened to wander in . But we blocked off the cave . The mother might have been trapped outside . We 'll leave the door open for her when we go , okay ? Look , it 's not that simple . What if she can sense we were here ? She ... she might be able to smell that faux lime aftershave of yours . I 'm sure you realize many species won 't return to a nest after it 's been tampered with . Well , there 's not much we can do about that now , is there ? We should just leave all this the way we found it . No . Neelix ! This creature is our responsibility . Ours ? The moment we came in here , it became our responsibility . And you expect to take care of this thing until what ? It graduates from high school , college ? And what if Mom doesn 't come back ? Are you planning to bring this with us back on the ship ? Look , if she does return and accepts the hatchling , it 'll solve everything . We just have to wait and see what she does . I don 't know how it is in your Quadrant , but in mine we don 't abandon a newborn ... thing . Fine . Fine , you made your point . I officially designate you its godfather . It stopped crying . It 's shivering . That 's normal ... isn 't it ? I mean , newborn life-forms do shiver , don 't they ? To be honest , I haven 't been around many newborns . Me neither . Oh ... look at this , Paris . It stopped shivering . It 's asleep . Forget what I said , Neelix . You 're not its godfather . You 're its godmother . The atmospheric window is forming , Captain . 30 degrees off the predicted coordinates . How soon will we have maximum aperture , Mr. Kim ? Nine minutes . All right , Commander , let 's try to draw some fire from their aft weapon systems . Bring us within ten kilometers . Shields at 80 percent . Minor damage to our port nacelle . Rerouting power to lateral thrusters . Tuvok ? So far , I 'm not detecting the same vulnerability in their shields this time , Captain . We may have to resort to additional force . Arm photons . Ready . Prepare to ... Stand by , Captain . I 'm detecting an opening . Direct hit to their aft control systems . Their weapons are disabled . Commander , proceed to Mr. Kim 's coordinates . One-half impulse . Oh , come on . Come on . Doesn 't seem to care for Starfleet rations . If I were in my kitchen , I could cook you up some delightful leola root broth . Are you serious ? Ugh , I hope I never see another leola root , and you are certainly not feeding any of that hideous broth to my niece ... or nephew ... whatever it is . Its heartbeat is getting weaker . I don 't like it . Come on , kid . You 've got to eat something . It seems far more interested in my jacket than your food . Neelix , it 's not your jacket . It 's the residue of the trigemic vapors we walked through . Think about it . Voyager 's sensors picked up high levels of proteins and amino acids , which we assumed meant this was a planet filled with vast supplies of edible plant life . We were certainly wrong about that . The residue is a concentration of proteins and amino acids . The perfect source of nutrition for the hatchling . The source we cut off when we blocked the cave . Come on , we 've got some rocks to move . The atmospheric window is at full aperture , Captain . We should have at least 17 minutes before it starts to close . Captain , the alien vessel is in pursuit . Are their weapon systems back on line already ? Negative . They are still disabled . They couldn 't be preparing to ram us , could they ? Hold your course . We need to get through that window , but prepare to take evasive action if necessary . Understood . Alien vessel closing to 1,000 kilometers . Five hundred . Three hundred . It has passed us and is proceeding toward the surface . Take us down , Commander . It 's not breathing ! I don 't think it 's breathing ! Come on , suck in some of those hearty vapors . It 's just too weak . There must be something in here we can use to resuscitate it . Neelix , we did the best we could . No ! It 's our fault , it 's our fault . If we hadn 't come ... Here . Cordrazine . This is a stimulant . You can 't pump it full of drugs without knowing its body chemistry . So we should just let it die ? Give me that . When I was a kid , a baby bird fell out of a nest and landed on the windowsill next to my bed . We had to feed it water with an eyedropper to keep it alive . What are you doing ? Filling the eyedropper . Can you hold its mouth open ? Do it again . Again . It 's working . It 's working ! Life signs are getting stronger . You did it ! We did it . You know , I never would have thought of that hypospray , if ... The vapors . Who cares ? Sensors are operating as well as can be expected under these conditions . Either we 're just not close enough to where they landed to pick up their com signals , or they never landed . Their shuttle might have burned up in the atmosphere . I 'm not willing to concede that yet . Any sign of the alien ship ? No , Captain . We 've lost them . Mr. Kim , how much longer before that window starts to close ? Nine minutes , 20 seconds . Chakotay , extend our surveillance pattern . If we don 't find them in five minutes , we 'll head back to the window . Aye , Captain . I 'm sorry . Hmm ? I feel I owe you an apology . No , you don 't . I had no right to push that pasta in your lap . Well ... think of it this way . It saved me from having to eat it . Nothing personal , but I just don 't have an affinity for hair in my food . I haven 't been fair to you . You know , I hear people talking about you in the Mess Hall . No kidding . What do they say ? Oh , that you used to be a coward and couldn 't be trusted . It 's typical of Kes that she would befriend someone like you ... someone who really needs a friend . And I guess I ... just got a little jealous . I got more than a little jealous . I realize now I was wrong . Neelix , I told you the truth when I said that nothing happened between me and Kes . I know . And I promise you , nothing ever will , but ... you weren 't wrong about me . What do you mean ? I ... Well , I guess the only way to say it is to say it . I am attracted to Kes . Oh ? To be honest , if you weren 't around , I 'd be knocking at her door . But I respect you , Neelix . And that 's that . Everything you heard those guys saying about me ... well , it was true . But it 's not who I am anymore . At least not who I want to be . This upside-down mission to the wrong side of the galaxy is giving me a second chance and I don 't intend to blow it . I see . Well , in a way , I can 't say I blame you . She is very attractive . She 's devoted to you , you know ? Well , I did save her life . I 'm sure she 's grateful . Oh , she 's a lot more than grateful . She loves you , Neelix . I wouldn 't stand a chance . Nobody would . There are others ? If you ever doubt yourself , just look into her eyes . See the way she looks at you . You 'll never doubt yourself again . And as far as I 'm concerned , I 'll just be her friend . I mean , if you don 't mind . I don 't pick Kes ' friends for her . Just my own . Voyager , this is Lieutenant Tom Paris and Mr. Neelix . Do you read ? We do , Mr. Paris . Are you all right ? Aside from a nasty rash , yes . Have you encountered life-forms ? Actually , yes . Are they hostile ? No . Just ... young . Young ? Yes , we found a nest , and one of the creatures hatched . Be aware , we encountered a hostile ship of unknown origin , and we 're showing that ship on the surface approximately one kilometer from your position . We 're attempting to lock on to you for transport . Stand by . We can 't leave yet . What ? Why ? What if the mother rejects it ? Neelix , one thing 's for sure ... whether the mother rejects it or not , she will reject you and me . We promised each other we wouldn 't abandon it until ... Away team , we 're showing a life-form moving toward your position . Prepare to transport . Captain , this is Neelix . Are you in a particular rush to leave ? Did you hear what I just said , Mr. Neelix ? Yes , but , uh ... we 're not quite finished here yet . Finished with what ? We have an atmospheric window closing in less than six minutes . And another one will be coming in how long ? Days . Is there a problem ? The problem is , Captain , if we leave our little hatchling here and the mother rejects it , it might die of exposure before we get back . I appreciate your concern for its welfare ... How long can you give us , Captain ? One minute , ten seconds , max . We 'll take it ! Lock on to us , Voyager . If you hear muffled screams , consider that a request for a beam-out . There 's nothing like a family reunion . Voyager , two to beam out ! As soon as you 're ready . Kes ! We didn 't know if you were dead or alive . What happened ? I became an uncle . And I 'm a godmother . I 'd say this is the special occasion I 've been waiting for to open up that bottle of Potak cold fowl I 've been saving . Cold fowl in a bottle ? That 's just an expression , isn 't it ? No . It 's actually made from the glandular secretions of an adult dunghill bird found only on Potak III . It 's very rare , very exquisite . There are , I believe only 27 bottles in existence at this time . It has a rather smoky flavor , uh ... going well with strong meaty dishes , but I prefer it for sipping ...

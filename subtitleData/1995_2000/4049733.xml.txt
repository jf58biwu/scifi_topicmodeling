 Holding course 351 mark 10 . Warp 7 . We 'll be passing a red dwarf system in 40 minutes . I can 't tell yet if there are any M-Class planets . You ready ? No , I really want to get on that transtator assembly diagnostic . Harry , I can 't do this alone . Sorry . Oh , you 're making a big mistake . Can 't you see what 's going to happen ? We 're the only humans out here , Harry . People are going to start pairing off and if we don 't get to the Delaney sisters in Stellar Cartography soon , somebody else will . I got a girl back home . So what ? I got five . I plan on seeing mine again . Harry , Harry , Harry , Harry , Harry . You really think she 's going to wait for you ? I hope so . Let her go . Let her have a husband and kids and a good life , while you and I have the Delaney sisters . I told you , I need to run a transtator diagnostic . You need to run a self-diagnostic . Look , they come as a pair . It 's a double date or no date . Come on . I told them all about you . What did you tell them about me ? Oh , well , for one thing , how you broke the single-pilot speed record at the Academy . Record ? I never broke any record . And who are they going to check it with ? Report ! We 're at the leading edge of a shock wave . Minor hull breach on Deck 3 , contained . Shields are holding . Engineering is undamaged , Captain . All systems operational . Mr. Paris , can you identify the source of the wave ? I 'm not sure . Scanners are picking up a debris cloud in the red dwarf system we 're approaching . It consists of differentially charged polaric ions , Captain . Differentially charged ? That would suggest a massive detonation . Are you familiar with any intelligent life-forms in this system , Mr. Neelix ? Familiar ? Ah , not exactly , uh , " familiar . " Considerably less than " familiar , " actually . Adjust course to investigate . Aye , Captain . Entering the system , Captain . Heading 010 mark 4 . Kes ... what are you doing here ? I had to know . Know ? Know what ? The origin of the shock wave is an M-Class planet , Captain . We 're within visual range . On screen . All vegetation on the planet has been destroyed . No satellite system in orbit . No evidence of spacecraft . Life signs ? - None . - None . But the polaric radiation may be interfering with the scanners . Take us into orbit . Density patterns on the surface show artificial waterways and a global aqueduct system . There is a civilization down there , Captain . Or there was . What do we know about surface conditions ? Radiation is within acceptable levels . Atmosphere : breathable . Mr. Paris , Tuvok , you 're with me . Ms. Torres , meet us in Transporter Room 2 . On my way . Commander , you have the Bridge . The entire surface of the planet was just ... seared . There was a chain reaction in subspace , very likely ignited by the detonation of one or more polaric ion devices . If that 's what happened , the people here never had a chance . They 're gone ... vaporized . Everything organic has basically been obliterated . At least it happened quickly . Polaric detonation would have swept through this city in seconds . It recalls the Chaltok iv incident . Chaltok iv ? A Romulan research colony was nearly destroyed during a testing of one of these devices . It led to the Polaric Test Ban Treaty of 2268 . So ... we 're looking at the end of a war . I wonder who won . I 'm not so sure there was a war . Look at these readings , B 'Elanna . Polaric ion concentrations are so high , I can 't get an accurate reading . I 'd say these conduits were the source of the explosion , wouldn 't you ? A civilization powered by polaric ion energy ? That 's what it looks like . A time bomb underneath every street , running into every home . What do you mean , you saw it ? How could you see it ? I don 't know . What did you see ? I saw them ... burn ... their bodies ... ashes where they stood ! You felt the shock wave in your sleep . This is just your imagination . A strange coincidence . I don 't think so . What else could it be ? It was ... it was almost telepathic . Telepathy is a message , words , a voice ... What you 're describing , why , it 's ... almost like the visions of Drakina Forest dwellers . Who ? A tribe with paranormal abilities . They can walk into an empty room ... Neelix , my ancestors were said to have unusual mental abilities . No one believes those stories . I always have . Look . This may be some kind of timepiece stopped at the moment of the explosion . What was that ? What ? Didn 't you hear that ? Hear what , Lieutenant ? Kids playing . They were as close to me as ... I don 't understand . I was here , in this square , but there were people . You never left here , Tom . But I saw them . Lots of people . Children playing and the sun was shining . There was no evidence of an explosion . Everyone was alive and happy . You were standing here the whole time . Your central nervous system is showing a temporal flux , but it 's rapidly returning to normal . The chain reaction has shattered subspace , Captain . I want everyone to stand exactly where they are . If Tuvok 's right , there may be subspace fractures floating like icebergs across the planet 's surface . Away team to Voyager . Go ahead . Four to beam up . Tuvok , B 'Elanna ? Hey , calm down . It 's all right . Now what 's the problem ? I saw them ! They appeared out of thin air ! They 're some kind of demons . I saw them with my own eyes . I 'm sorry we startled him . We just came around the corner . They 're lying ! Shh , now . Calm down . You 've been reading too many of those Darkstorm tales , young fellow . There 's no such thing as demons . But I 'm telling you ... Ah , ah , ah , run along now . Have a confection bar and calm down . All right , everybody , back to your business . Nothing else to see here now . Oh , sorry about that . No problem . Who knows what gets into their heads , huh ? Oh , perhaps the uniforms scared him . We 're not from this area . Come in on the Continental Transport ? This morning . is , uh , that what they 're wearing in Kalto province these days ? Uh , this is , uh , a little more formal than most . You know how it is when you travel . We were actually looking for a clothing shop . We thought we 'd change into something more appropriate . There 's one right over there . I hope the rest of your stay with us is more enjoyable . I wish I could say it will be . Need a timepiece ? Maybe you could help me . I 'm from ... Kalto province . I 'm not used to your timepieces . They 're no different than Kalton timepieces . Are you sure ? What do these numbers stand for ? Rotations , intervals , fractions . Same as any timepiece . 14 kelodas . A fair price . I might stop back later . If there 's time . If I understood correctly , this world is going to be destroyed sometime tomorrow . First Officer 's Log , supplemental . There 's been no sign of Captain Janeway or Lieutenant Paris since they were lost in a subspace fracture . This is one of the subspace fractures we 've located with a magneton scan of the surface . This is the time of the explosion where the fracture opens . The , as the shock waves dissipate , the fracture grows more narrow . We believe that the Captain and Lieutenant Paris are trapped at the narrow end . Shock waves from most explosions dissipate into the future , but we 're speculating- - based in part on what Paris told us he saw- - that these dissipate into the past . That 's consistent with the subspace damage we 've observed . Why haven 't they been able to return as Mr. Paris did the first time ? He wasn 't all the way inside a fracture . Remember ? We still saw Paris standing there even when he could see the other side . So it 's possible the Captain and Paris are existing only hours and minutes before the explosion occurs . There 's no way for us to measure exactly how far back these fractures go . How do we find them ? If I know Captain Janeway , she would activate a subspace beacon to assist us . We 're counting on it . First , we have to find a fracture in a location where they 've been then we have to microscan the fracture to try to pick up the signal from their subspace beacon . Once we 've identified where and when they are , then we have to widen the fracture at that point . How do you suggest we do that ? We 're not sure yet . Hmm . Mm-hmm . - What ? - Hmm ? is something wrong ? Yes , terribly wrong . Your brain is ... not on file . Either your government failed to transmit the standard 15-501 Crew Personnel Report or somebody at Starfleet Medical really fouled up . I 'm not a member of the Starfleet crew . We came aboard at mid-expedition . And no one asked you for your medical histories when you arrived ? Of course not- - that would be the ship 's doctor 's job . My job . If anyone had bothered to tell me about new passengers , but I seem to be the last to know just about everything around here . So . Tell me- - just how many other new arrivals are there ? Just us . And the crew from another ship that was destroyed . Another ... crew ? That 's nice . This is the emergency medical holographic system to Captain Janeway . She 's not on board . She 's missing on the surface of a planet . Missing ? The Captain is missing ? It seems I 've found myself on the voyage of the damned . Very well . Please advise the highest-ranking officer who is not missing to see me at his earliest convenience . You may shut off my program now . But you haven 't told us anything about her condition . She 's the healthiest member of her species l 've ever seen ... the only member of her species l 've ever seen . You have a lovely brain . It will make a fine addition to our files . I wouldn 't worry . If your species has a history of extraordinary mental abilities , this may simply be your way of flexing those muscles for the first time . Living in space requires the body to make a variety of biological adjustments . This could be a side effect of that process . Go home . Get a good night 's sleep ... and drink plenty of fluids . Fluids ? Everybody should drink plenty of fluids . Don 't leave without turning me off . Computer , end program . And call me in the morning . We can assume that Voyager will be looking for a way to reach us . I 'll set my combadge to emit a subspace beacon . If they get close , maybe they 'll pick it up . I know . Maybe there 's some way ... Don 't even think about it , Tom . The Prime Directive is clear . We cannot allow our presence to alter this planet 's natural course of events . Even if the natural course of events is annihilation ? Yeah . My father used to talk at length to us about the Prime Directive , once a year- - like a holiday sermon . He considered it the guiding principle of space exploration . To be honest , I tuned out most of his sermons years ago . Well , tune back into this one because I agree with him . You have no idea what the consequences might be once you involve yourself . The consequences would have to be better than mass destruction . You 're not to warn these people . That 's an order . Oh , God . Come on . I know you 're lying . Young man , we 're here on a business trip and we have a lot of work to do . The Officer told me you came here on the Continental Transport . That 's right . We 're from Kalto province . Yeah ? Well , I just talked to the transport attendant . He told me four people came today from Kalto . Two of them were a lot older than you and they had a child with them . Well , the attendant was wrong . That was us . So , where 's the child ? We ate him . Because we are demons and we eat children . And I haven 't had my supper yet . Sorry , I just figured it was the quickest way . Let 's concentrate on getting out of here . The same subspace fractures that brought us here might still be around . If they were caused by a polaric explosion is there any way we could use polaric energy to get us back ? If we had access to a polaric ion generator , we could modify a tricorder to emit a polaric field . At the very least , it might help us scan for a fracture . I wonder where these conduits get their power . This is a lawful demonstration . We have a right to be here ! Under normal circumstances , I 'd say we should come back tomorrow . This device uses the same polaric energy that destroyed the planet . At intense levels , it can open a subspace fracture . Wide enough for the Captain and Paris to get through ? If we can locate them , this is capable of bringing them back . The logical place to begin would be at the same location they disappeared . The only problem is , at the necessary intensity , the polaric generator will burn itself out after 30 seconds at best . Can 't we reinitialize the generator and try again ? Not at the same location . Once we make an attempt at any given location , the damage to subspace will make a second attempt impossible . How do we prevent one of us from getting trapped in a fracture ? We 've modified our tricorders to detect the fractures and all of us will be wearing one of these . It puts out an anti-polaric field . It should repel the fractures when they get within three meters . Nice work . Ah , Commander . Will you be going back to the planet 's surface ? We 're getting ready to leave right now . I have to go with you . There 's nothing down there you want to see , Kes . That 's what I told her . I 've already seen it . I have to go . We 're sorry to involve you in this . Pe 'Nar Makull . My colleague , Ny Terla . Apparently , you just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time . I was just thinking the very same thing . What were you doing there ? We 're from Kalto province . We were hoping to tour your power facility ... compare it to our own . I 've never seen a Kalton with your color hair . Well , now you have . My friend thinks you were sent by the government to infiltrate us . lnfiltrate ? You were there when she got this . Perhaps you were told to put on a good show for us . We don 't even know why someone would want to infiltrate you . That 's hard to believe . Even in Kalto , there are protests against polaric energy . We 're not spies . When was the last time you were in a power plant ? Not since we left home . You weren 't in that plant yesterday ? We were just getting there when we stumbled into you . We know you 're not telling the truth . We have safety monitors to measure polaric energy . When you were brought here , they registered five times the normal readings . To register levels this high , you were either inside that plant yesterday or ... at the site of a polaric disaster worse than any in the history of this planet . What is it ? It 's as though I can sense the people who were here . I know . It 's like walking through a graveyard . No . It 's more than that . I almost feel ... as if I could touch the people who were here . What have you found ? The scanners are not showing any subspace fractures in the area now . That probably indicates the subspace damage is beginning to dissipate . If that 's true , it 's going to be harder to locate Tom and the Captain . Commander , I 'm picking up a signal from a combadge . The subspace beacon ? No , it 's not on subspace . It 's here ... now . Kim to Janeway . Kim to Paris . Can we locate the source of the signal ? Yes , sir . This way . What 's your name ? Janeway . Unusual name . Not where l 'm from . What part of Kalto province was that again ? I don 't see any point in this . There is a point , a very important one . It has to do with our schedule and whether we can keep it or not . Can we ? I don 't know . Do they know our plan ? I have no idea . Let me go ! Look what I caught sneaking around outside . I 'm still not showing any life signs . The boy has nothing to do with any of this . is he yours ? No . He 's just somebody we met here . Don 't trust them . They aren 't who they say they are . Really ? Thanks , kid . Look , this is all a misunderstanding . They lied about coming here on the Continental Transport . I talked to the attendant myself . Let me go ... What do we do with him ? We can 't let him go . Just put him over there with the other . Now stay quiet . The combadge is designed to self-activate when the casing is destroyed . to help searchers locate victims . I guess it means they were caught in the explosion . It only means their combadges were caught in the explosion . Further speculation serves no purpose . I suggest we search for other tangible evidence . None of us have seen devices like these before . Terla believes they 're spy equipment . They 're for surveying property . I 've been thinking of buying land here . I need to survey it . I 'd be curious to know how they work . Would you show me ? But then one of them might be a weapon . And I wouldn 't want you to show me how that works , would I ? Hey , kid . You were right about one thing . I was lying . I don 't eat children . You don 't scare me . My father works for the Media Bureau . And when I tell him all about this , he 'll ... What is he , some kind of journalist ? Yes , and so am I . is that right ? I report for my school journal . That 's right where everyone 's going to find out about you when I write about this in next week 's edition . What 's your name ? - Latika . - Latika . I 'm sorry . For what ? I just am . I realize how this must appear to you , but I 'm just a patriot . A patriot ? I sincerely believe polaric energy has the potential to destroy this entire world . And I take it , very few people here agree with you ? We have more support since the accident at Markov . We know the companies are afraid of us . We know they 've increased security at all their plants , but it will not be enough to stop us . We can 't wait another week . We have to move up the schedule . We know they 're not telling us the truth . We have to assume the government sent them . Tell everyone we begin at 0400 tomorrow . Wait a minute . Captain ... ? Kes ... Do you have something to tell me , Janeway- - if that 's your real name ? It is my real name . Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager . I can feel their presence . Please elaborate . How can you feel their presence ? I don 't know . I just can . They 've been in this room . I know it . is there a subspace fracture anywhere in here ? Affirmative . Set up the equipment . You wanted the truth . All right . Here 's the truth . We 're from the future- - exactly one day in the future . You mean I was right ? We weren 't allowed to tell . At least , I thought we weren 't . In a few hours from now , there will be a serious accident on this world . It will be caused by a polaric detonation . We came here in an interstellar ship to investigate that explosion . When we arrived , we were exposed to the polaric radiation . Showing a subspace fracture . Coordinates : 141 by 21 by 14 . Five percent drift . Range : four meters . Got it . lnitiating generator . lnitiating microscan of the subspace fracture . It 's very likely that whatever you 're planning to do could be responsible for this tragedy . And somehow , you were able to come back here to warn us ? The explosion had an aftereffect that no one expected . It created fractures in time . We fell through one of those fractures . Interstellar ships , fractures in time- - do you honestly expect us to believe all this ? I found them . Scanners are picking up a subspace beacon . Adjusting penetration coordinates to match . I 'll try to open up the other end . Chakotay to Janeway . Captain , can you read us ? Eavesdropping devices . No , but they are for communication . My crew is trying to contact me . From the future , of course . Get the particle injector . Bring them with us- - the boy , too . I have an idea how they can help . Chakotay to Janeway . Can you read me ? Please respond . I don 't get it , Captain . This morning you were giving orders about not interfering because of the Prime Directive . Now you 're telling them everything . I told them the truth when I realized we 'd already violated the Prime Directive in the worst possible manner . How did we do that ? Just by being here . Because if we hadn 't been here , it 's very possible this world would not have been destroyed . What ? Think about it , Tom . Before we got involved , these people were planning to commit some kind of sabotage next week . We were the ones who forced a change in their schedule . Because of us , they decided to begin today at 400 rotations and we know the detonation takes place today just after 401 . 401 : 22 : 84 . Wait a minute . You 're saying we 're responsible for an explosion even though it occurred before our ship arrived here ? We 've traveled back to a point in time before the explosion . So , yes , we can be responsible for it . Let 's say we never came and their plans didn 't change . Wouldn 't the accident simply have occurred next week instead of today ? Who knows what might have happened between now and then . They could have been arrested before they got a chance to carry it out . Conditions at the plant might not have been the same next week . But it 's become our problem now , Tom , and we have got to find a way to solve it . We 're running out of time . The subspace fractures are closing . We 've lost over 70 percent of them . At this point , we 're suggesting we concentrate our search at the flash point . May I ask what you expect to accomplish by doing that ? We figure the Captain and Paris might have looked for the origin of the explosion to try and prevent it . Unlikely . It would be a highly questionable decision in light of the Prime Directive . If it were me , I would have tried to get there . The issue is whether Captain Janeway would go there , not you , Commander . You think you can locate the flash point ? We already have . Let 's go . Your job is to get us past the guards . We 'll tell them you 're bringing us here to negotiate a settlement of our dispute with the power company . I cannot and will not do anything to help you . Think before you say no . Terla has a weapon trained on the boy . If shooting begins , he 'll be the first victim . is there something I can do for you ? She 's a government representative on official business . I am a hostage . These men are here to break into the plant . Their lives are on your conscience , Janeway ! You saved my life . Don 't waste ... time with me , Captain . Got to stop them . Will you stay with him until help arrives ? Sure he will . The kid and I ... we 're old friends now , aren 't we ? Yeah . I 'll be back for you . We 'll be here . The polaric levels are higher here than any place we 've been so far . This was undoubtedly the flash point of the explosion . Whatever went wrong , it started here . Do we have subspace fractures to work with in here ? Affirmative . They remain quite numerous in this area . Set up the equipment . Aye , sir . I need the injector . Just hand that bag to me . 41 by 310 . Two percent drift . Range : six meters . Mark . I have it . lnitiating generator . Scanning for the subspace beacon . It doesn 't look like they were here . It is highly unlikely that Captain Janeway would come here to ... No , the Captain did come . She was here . This is where she died . Everybody on this planet has less than three minutes to live if you go through with this , Makull . Don 't ! What exactly do you think we are planning to do here ? I assume you 're going to sabotage the plant probably by detonating some kind of device . We 're not stupid enough to blow up anything here . That may be true , but something will go wrong . Nothing is going to go wrong unless you fire that weapon near a polaric conduit . For everyone 's safety , I suggest you put it down . Give me the bag . All right , then ... we 'll wait . If Kes is right , the Captain was here at the moment the explosion occurred . is there any way to break through subspace a few minutes before the detonation ? If the widest point of the fracture represents the time of the explosion , couldn 't we open a hole just before the widest point ? There 's no way we could pinpoint the exact time we 'd be penetrating , but we could make an educated guess . I feel it is my duty to point out there is absolutely no logical reason to believe Kes is correct . However , since I have no alternative course of action to recommend at this time , I suggest we proceed . Commander ? What time is it ? 401 rotations plus 21 . We 'll just wait until ... 23 . Twenty-three ? What 's the importance of 23 ? Oh . This is all about the alleged time of our self-annihilation . All right . Let 's just see if we can all get through the ... What 's going on ? They 're cutting through subspace . My God . It 's going to intersect with the conduit wall . Our own rescue attempt . That 's what sets it off . My weapon may be able to seal that hole . It 's our only chance . I 'm getting nadion particle resistance from the other side . lncreasing generator to maximum output . The generator 's overloading . I don 't understand . It 's not working . We 're not penetrating the fracture . Harry , Harry , Harry , Harry , Harry . You really think she 's going to wait for you ? I hope so . Let her go . Let her have a husband and kids and a good life , while you and I have the Delaney sisters . I told you I need to run a transtator diagnostic . You need to run a self-diagnostic . Look , they come as a pair . It 's a double date or no date . Come on . I told them all about you . What did you tell them about me ? Uh , well , for one thing , how you broke the single-pilot speed record at the Academy . Record ? I never broke any record . And who are they going to check it with ? Chakotay to Captain Janeway . Yes , Commander . We 've identified an M-Class planet in the red dwarf system we 're approaching . Do you want to change course to investigate ? Are you familiar with any intelligent life-forms in this system , Mr. Neelix ? Familiar ? Ah , not exactly " familiar . " Considerably less than " familiar , " actually . Kes ... what are you doing here ? I had to know . Know ? Know what ? The planet ... everyone was killed . There was this terrible explosion . You , you had a bad dream . No. lt was more than a dream . Mr. Tuvok , any indications of trouble on that M-Class planet ? Negative , Captain . is it populated ? Sensors do show humanoid life . There is no satellite system and no indications of spacecraft in the vicinity . It appears to be a pre-warp civilization . Which means as a policy , we don 't involve ourselves in their affairs . Of course . A most enlightened philosophy . Come on , Kes . I 'm sorry . Captain ... ls it possible to see this planet on the viewscreen ? There it is . Thank you . Come on . Just ... Enter the planet 's coordinates into the log and maintain present heading , Commander . Warp 6 . Aye , Captain .

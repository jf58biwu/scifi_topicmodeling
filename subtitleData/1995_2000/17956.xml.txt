 What 's this ? Filipino New Year 's ? No . Why you say that ? 'Cause you 're cooking a feast . I can smell it from the interstate . What is that ? Barbecue ? Yeah . But it not coming from here . What is that noise ? What is your take on this , Jerry ? The people will love it , Mr. President . Our conflict is whether we ambush the 6 : 00 news or hold out for prime time . Screw the press . This is a need-to-know situation . We should make it top secret , and should move in with Defcon Four . We can 't sit on this . General Casey , do you have an opinion ? Well , sir do we know they are hostile ? What do you mean ? They have the planet surrounded by thousands of warships ! Do we know they 're warships ? Professor , what do we know about them ? They 're very advanced technologically . Which suggests , rightfully so , that they 're peaceful . An advanced civilization is , by definition , not barbaric . Mr. President this is a great day . I and all my colleagues are extremely excited . Good . Extraterrestrial life . You 're right , Jerry . The people are going to love it . This is a momentous occasion . Mr. President- - We 'll go all media on this . I 'll wear my Cerruti suit . I 'll need a good speech . Statesman-like historical and yet warm , neighborly . Abraham Lincoln meets Leave it to Beaver , kind of thing . Are they too old-fashioned ? No , I don 't think so . This has got the colors but , no . I don 't think so . Not vivid enough . Nancy had this in the library . Yes , indeed . I don 't think so . I thought perhaps the watered silk . This week it 's on sale . I hardly think I need worry about that . My husband is the leader of the free world . What do you think ? Why don 't you leave the Roosevelt Room the way the Roosevelts wanted it . Because Eleanor Roosevelt was too fond of chintz . That 's why . Mother , this isn 't your house . If you 're going to be a pest , I 'll ignore you ! Mrs. Dale ? I saw you fight Sonny Liston in ' 69 . Really ? You were a nun back then ? We 've always been fight fans , haven 't we sisters ? Byron Williams , telephone . I must go . You ladies have a nice time . Oh , Louise . Sorry to call you at work , but the boys haven 't been home in two nights . I don 't know what to do . You 're doing the best you can . They 're just at that age . The casino manager 's giving me the evil eye . I 've gotta go . I 'll call you later , okay ? Are you still cool on me coming to Washington ? 'Course I am . You take care , okay ? Bye . Must you drink in front of me ? You 're an adult . Just cope . It doesn 't help me that all we ever do is sit in bars . This is work , baby , okay ? I 'm checking the decor , the lighting , the traffic flow . If I 'd known you 'd turn into a crook , I wouldn 't have married you . I 'm not a crook . I 'm ambitious . There 's a difference . If you think you can make a nickel in this town without knowing how to dally around a few curves , well you know nothing of the gambling industry . The Galaxy 's going to be the best hotel in Vegas . The best ! I promise . But don 't you realize what you 're doing ? You 're destroying the Earth ! All this greed ! This money system ! You 're destroying everything ! Okay , Barbara , okay . Keep your voice down . I got friends here . Sugar ! Hit me one more time . Stop flirting with the waitress . God . Here . Go over to the roulette play our anniversary and stay off of black . Thanks . Make it quick , we go out live in ten minutes . What ? The actual president ? Cutting in ? Budget negotiations may be dead in the water after this week . Hair looks good . I like the hair . ... quote , " factually-challenged . " Yeah , Stone . Speak . Jason , hi , it 's me . You wearing a bra ? Listen , this is big . President Dale is cutting into my show today . That 's absurd . Why would he stoop to being on " Today in Fashion " ? He 's interrupting everybody . I don 't know , it 's some sort of an emergency announcement . This doesn 't make sense . He should talk to us . White House is coming out live . Good evening , my fellow Americans . I apologize for interrupting your regular programs but I have a very important announcement to make . Many important things have happened to me in my life : My graduation from Princeton the day that Marsha said she would be my wife the birth of our daughter Taffy . Thanks , Dad . And the news that I have heard today ranks right up there . A powerful memory is in the making . Not just for me but for all mankind . Today an extraordinary discovery was made by the Hubble telescope . The data from the Hubble was decoded then analyzed by the most powerful computers at MIT . The images are undeniable . We are entering the dawn of a new era . Frame enlargements provide an astonishing sight . A fleet of vehicles , which can best be described as flying saucers . Come on ! Come on ! Papa needs a new pair of shoes ! Hey , am I the only one shooting craps here ? We hope we will have the chance to meet with them . This is the perfect summation to the 20th Century ... . Martians . This is great . Please , come to Earth . Please . We need you . I got people coming in ! Everybody wants to be part of this . Galaxy 's going to be world class . And soon we will become one solar system . What the hell 's he talking about ? These flying saucers have come from Mars and at their current course and speed will enter Earth 's orbit in 16 hours . I 've been thinking about Martians when there weren 't any . It is profoundly moving to know there is intelligent life out there . Glad it 's somewhere . Our world will never feel quite the same again . Good night and God bless you all . This is intense . Shut up , Poppy . Shut up . Shut up ! Jason Stone . It 's for you . Poppy , honey . No , sweetie . That 's right . Good girl . I could be there at I don 't know , 11 : 00 . They want me to interview the professor from the White House . Kessler ? Donald Kessler ? Yeah , I think that was his name . You know , the science guy . This is nuts , this is ... . We should have got that guy . Your people are too slow . Right , Poppy ? Finished ! One minute , 57 seconds . - Didn 't I tell you under two minutes ? - You did ! You did ! Hot damn . Want a doughnut ? How old are they ? Fresh baked , Monday . Richie , that 's six days ago ! Give me a couple . This Martian thing is pretty awesome . Did one of you traitors see my Muffy ? Your brother 's volunteering . As soon as I get back to the base . Volunteer for what ? Martian detail . Cool . If any Martians come around here , I 'll kick their butts ! Jump ! Folks , we must make an unscheduled stop ! It 's Mama . Why are you here ? If you ain 't home , why ain 't you in class ? Class was cancelled . It was not ! - Come here ! - Why ? I 'm not going to hurt you . Let go of him . Okay . Now just come here . Come here . Think it 's smart to cut school ? - What are you doing ? - Do you ? No , it 's dumb . You 'll flunk ! Go to jail ! Get on the bus ! Get on ! I 'll be tripping on you . Get back there . I don 't want to hear anymore . I hate school . I heard that ! Hi , there . Want a date ? How about it ? A date ? It sounds good . The stress at work is unbelievable . May I speak to you in private ? No , I must watch the floor . What do you want ? - I 'm supporting a family back east . - I thought you were divorced . I am , but I still have to take care of them . Things have been a little lean around here . I was wondering if I could get a raise ? Out of the question . I 'm an asset to this hotel . They like me around here . You 're a nice guy . But I can get Leon Spinks or Buster Douglas for the same money . You better get moving . You 're on in five minutes . This show 's going to get a great rating . It 's all yours . ln certain circumstances the proposition that two and two equals five is entirely legitimate . Call me Nathalie . And you , do please call me Donald . I admire your show . Really ? You like my work ? Yes . Very much . Why ... . Thank you . Coming out of commercial . In five ... four three ... two ... . Welcome back . We 're with Professor Donald Kessler . He 's the chairman of the American Academy of Astronautics . Professor isn 't it weird that we sent a space probe to Mars and we didn 't even find anyone ? Well , not really Nathalie . We didn 't get into the canals . The Martian canals are canyons . Some are over 100 miles deep . The Martian civilization has clearly developed under the planet 's surface . Their science and technology must be absolutely mind-boggling . So what in your view , Donald Kessler Chairman , are some of the things the Martians can teach us , Professor ? Quite a lot about Mars , Nathalie . She 's flirting . But seriously , this is tremendously exciting . The knowledge , the new ideas : it 'll change everything . And we must be open to it . Maybe they can tell us about our universe . How it started . Where it 's going . Perhaps even its purpose . It 's tremendously exciting . It 's the most important event since Jesus walked in Galilee- - Christ . What 's wrong ? Go to Camera Two ! I can 't . It 's busted . Go to One ! Go to Four ! He copped a feel . Now what ? What 's that ? So that 's a Martian . That 's a Martian ? Oh , my God ! Yikes ! I 'm not having that thing in my house . Sweetie we may have to . The people expect me to meet them . They 're not eating off the Van Buren china . Look at that brain . He must be real smart . It 's gross ! Don 't forget , Nathalie that we will look equally gross to him . He made the international sign of the doughnut . From the limited information available , I 've made three extrapolations . One : Our Martian friend is a carbon-based life form . Two : He breathes nitrogen . And three : The large cerebrum here , indicates telepathic potential . You mean they can read our thoughts ? Potentially , yes . What about their intentions ? Are they friendly people ? Logic dictates that given their high level of technical development they 're an advanced culture . Therefore , peaceful and enlightened . The human race , on the other hand is an aggressively dangerous species . Now I suspect they have more to fear from us than we from them . Doctor . Thank you . For many years , I 've been refining a translating computer . The results are not perfect , but this may answer some of your questions . Green skin 800 centuries ago . Their bodily fluids include the birth of half-breeds . How many centuries did he say ? Eight hundred , sir . Self-determination of the cosmos . For dark is the suede that mows like a harvest . What the hell does that mean ? Hey , Mitch . Good morning . I 'm sorry , you can 't come this way . There 's a tour in progress . Hello , my name is Barbara . Hello , Barbara . I am an alcoholic , but I haven 't had a drink in three months . I 'm feeling so optimistic because of the Martians . We 're not alone in the universe . And it 's so perfect that it 's happening at the beginning of the new millennium . Our planet was suffering with the ozone and the rain forest and so many people unhappy in their lives . And then the Martians heard our global karmic cry for help . People say they 're ugly but I think they 've come to show us the way . I think they 've come to save us . Thank you . Bye-bye . You be careful . Don 't get yourself killed . Ain 't she cute ? - We 're real proud of you . - Thanks , Dad . Let me take this . So long , retard . Don 't touch any of my stuff while I 'm gone . Bye-bye , Grandma . Good-bye , Thomas . It 's Billy-Glenn , Grandma . I know , Thomas . Bye-bye , honey . I must go . Take care of my boy . He 'll be all right . I hope so . Army trains them good . He 's gone for a while . Why can 't you be more like your brother ? We got lucky with Billy-Glenn . You can 't expect the same luck twice . Richie , want to make yourself useful for a change ? Sure , Dad . Take Grandma back to the home . I bet you never thought you 'd live to see the Martians come . It 's pretty far out . But think of all the crazy things you must have seen . I bet people were pretty scared when they invented the train . Come on , kid , I 'm not that old ! Are you okay ? I want to see Slim . I want to see Slim and Muffy and Richie . Grandma , I 'm Richie . I know , Thomas . Richie was always the best one . Right now the president is talking to other world leaders . They 're preparing a list of issues of common interest to discuss . There is a unilateral , concerted , diplomatic effort being made . Jason . Thanks . If the Martians land , can the press do interviews ? Well , that depends . We must establish contact work out communication problems establish parameters . Then I guess we just see what happens . Here 's the president . Good morning . It 's nice to see you all again . I just have a few minutes for questions , so let 's get started . Mr. President ! Do the Martians have two sexes , like we do ? From Hollywood we bring you the " Lawrence Welk Show " ! Here he is , Mr. Music Maker himself , Lawrence Welk . This pussycat is the most beautiful pussycat in the whole world . That 's my Muffy . Didn 't you ever have a pussycat of your own ? Sure , Grandma . Music ! There you go . You going to be okay ? If you need anything , any doughnuts or anything , call me . How do ? Looks like you ain 't got no wheels . Come on get in . I 'm going to do you a favor . I owe you one . I made a ton of money on your last fight in ' 73 . The Quaker in Jamaica . I 'm glad somebody did . Yeah , I know , I know . It 's rough on jocks . You get to a certain age opportunities dry up . So here 's the deal . I got this chum , owes me a lot of money , needs a wake-up call . What I 'd like you to do is use that patented left hook on him . Just in the ring , Art . Just in the ring . Yeah , I 'm hip , I 'm hip , but I 'll give you two grand . When you 're done all you must do is mosey on by the office and get the cash . Why do you want to come at me that way ? I 'm trying to get back with my wife . We had problems with this kind of shit . But I 've changed , man . I found Allah I don 't eat pork , I 'm a better man . I faced that demon and I don 't want him coming again . You gave up pork ! They 're sending coordinates . Where are they landing ? Pahrump . It 's in the Nevada desert . I can have my troops there at 0800 hours , sir . We must not send these people the wrong message . We need a welcome mat , not tanks ! What are you talking about ? You can 't have Martians running all over Nevada ! You 're right . - Thank you , sir . - This situation needs to be supervised . Absolutely , sir . General Casey can you handle it ? I 'd be proud . Good , but keep a lid on it . Key media , good cross-section of guests . We don 't want it to turn into a zoo out there . They don 't know what they 're talking about ! Liberals , intellectuals peacemongers , idiots ! Would you please keep it down ? People live here ! General Casey . Yes , I get to greet the Martian ambassador . Isn 't that great ? Oh , it 's a hell of an honor . Didn 't I always tell you if I stayed in place and never spoke up good things were bound to happen ? I want the Martians to be treated like foreign dignitaries . I want your men alert and majestic with a snap in their step . This must look good . The world is watching . Yes , sir . Are you positive this thing will work ? Positively positive . We don 't want any slip-ups . No , no , no , no . Not at all . Poppy . All these people . All of them here to see you . There 's Jason , Poppy ! Okay , let 's go . The teeming masses have gathered from who knows how many states waiting and watching . Why have they come ? Curiosity ? Or is it something more ? Or simply to say , ' I was there ' ? 'I was there ... ' ... when first man ... ' ... met Martian . ' Jason Stone GNN Pahrump . Some room . Give them room . It is an awesome sight . The giant spacecraft glinting in the Nevada sun like a giant hubcap . Something 's happening . The doorway is opening . A silver ramp is coming out like a giant tongue . Gee whiz . Martians ! Funny little critters . Well ? Wait . Greetings . I am the Martian ambassador . Everything is fixed now . You may speak . Greetings . I am General Casey ... On behalf of the people of Earth : Welcome . He did that well . We come in peace . We come in peace . We come in peace . They came in peace . We come in peace . Open fire ! What ? Die , you alien shithead ! I surrender ! No , it ain 't happening ! It didn 't happen ! Holy Mother of God ! Did you see that ? We should hit these assholes with everything we 've got , sir . Sir , Mr. President , I know this seems terrible but let 's not be too rash . We should nuke them ! We must establish a line of communication first . Set up a town hall . We 'll get the public 's opinion . What do you think ? Kick the crap out of them . Ladies and gentlemen it may be a cultural misunderstanding . Maybe to them , doves mean war . We all saw how they reacted to that dove . It frightened them . He did say that " We come in peace . " The new computer 's ready . Okay , let 's do it . I know we 're making the right decision . Ready to transmit . This is the president of the United States . I 'm speaking in the hope that what happened earlier today in the Nevada desert was a cultural misunderstanding . There can be no doubt that we two peoples have a great deal to offer one another . You must be as excited as we to find intelligent life in the solar system . Let me make it clear . You have nothing to fear from us . Our customs may be strange to you but we mean no harm . When the investors fly in I would like for them each to be met by a limo . Top of the line cars leather interiors Corinthian , if they got it . Are you still spinning your wheels on that cockamamie hotel ? Hello ! The Martians have attacked ! This was no misunderstanding . I was there . I saw it . Look , you 're worried about yesterday . I 'm worried about tomorrow . The Martians land on Earth , they 'll need a place to stay . Just like everyone else . My God . Maybe we should all be destroyed . The human race doesn 't deserve to live . Ethel that reminds me . I 'd like the limos to be stocked with every kind of alcohol known to man . And top it off with a bottle of Dom on ice . What confounds me most of all is the lack of genitalia . Down here is the aorta . Up here we have the sphinx . Notice the highly developed nerve system here . This explains , of course , the cerebral arteries . And if we notice down here , behind the optic chiasm several glands ... . Very curious . " He who believes in me , though he die , yet shall he live . " And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die . " Billy-Glenn Norris gave his life defending our country . Why did it have to be him ? He 's a true American hero . May God rest his soul . Ready ! Aim . Fire ! Aim ! Fire ! Hello ? Byron ! Is everything all right ? You still coming tomorrow ? Just try and stop me . That plane arrives at 4 : 00 p.m. Are the kids there ? Yeah , hold on . - Me first . - No , me . Hey , Dad . Who 's that ? Neville ? How are you ? We 're going to the White House . The White House ? Yeah , tomorrow . - Give it back ! - Leave me alone . It 's a school thing , like a tour . So you 're still going to school once in a while ? Give me your ma again . Hold on . Mom . - You always get to the phone first . - So what ? I 'm first to the game . Why are you wasting this phone time ? I 'll see you tomorrow . But there 's something I want to say to you . Just ' cause I feel like saying it . What 's that ? I love you . I love you too , Byron . Now stop wasting money ! I 'll see you tomorrow ! They 're responding . A message from the Martians . Really ? They 've issued a formal apology . This is great ! I told you this would happen . The Martian ambassador feels terrible and wants to speak to Congress . That 's good , isn 't it ? You bet . It 's a victory for our administration . Ladies and gentlemen . This is a proud day for all Americans . This is a hell of a photo-op , Jerry . Are you sure I shouldn 't be there ? The Secret Service don 't want the executive branch and the legislative branch in the same room . The Martian ambassador is going to say a few words . Come on down , Mr. Ambassador ! Mr. Ambassador , please ! Please ! This doesn 't make sense ! It 's not logical ! It 's not- - Guess it wasn 't the dove . Fire ! They blew up Congress ! Why 'd they do that ? Maybe they don 't like the human being . Hello , gentlemen . Nice of you to come on such short notice . General Decker it seems I owe you an apology . We all make mistakes , Mr. President . Not anymore . We 're going to take charge of this thing ! Excellent . I have prepared the order . What 's this ? Your executive order for full use of our nuclear deterrent . Are you crazy ? I 'm not starting a war ! We 're already at war , sir ! We have to nuke them ! We must nuke them now ! General Decker , if you do not shut up I 'll relieve you of your command . We must strike now , sir ! Annihilate ! Kill ! Kill ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Now I want the people to know that they still have two out of three branches of government working for them , and that ain 't bad . I want the people to know that the schools will still be open , okay ? And I want the people to know that the garbage will still be carried out . And I want a cop on every corner . Which , incidentally we would already have if they had listened to me in the last election . Jerry how soon can we go on the air ? My fellow Americans . It is with a heavy heart that I speak to you this afternoon . As you know earlier today the Martian ambassador and his confederates attacked and killed many of your representatives on Capitol Hill . I will be conferring with other world leaders as time goes on . And rest assured that , working together we will soon come out at a very real outcome . Thank you . Nathalie , is that you ? Yes . How 're you ? Not terribly good , I 'm afraid . May I ask you a question ? Of course you can . Were you flirting with me on the show ? Because if you were I just want you to know that I liked it . You did ? Really ? Because , you know , I 've watched you on TV quite a bit and well , I 've had something of a schoolboycrush on you for oh , gosh ages . Hi , there . Are you interested in the White House ? I work there . I 'm the press secretary . Jerry Ross . Have you ever heard of me ? You wouldn 't believe the pressure of my job . It 's nice to see a new face . Are you doing anything ? 'Cause if you want , I could give you a personalized tour . Would you like that ? Hey , Mitch , it 's me . Can you let me in ? Hello , Mr. Ross . Sure . We 're a little nervous here , after what happened . Exactly . Many great men and women have passed through here . Now we 're passing through here . Feels good , don 't it ? You 're very graceful . I like that . Come here . We call this the Kennedy Room . Pretty nifty , huh ? So how about a drink ? Getting more comfortable . Outstanding . How 's my lady doing ? Oh , missy , you 're hot . Could we get that gum out of your mouth ? My finger ! Hello ! Hello , operator ? This is an emergency ! Help ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't worry , darling . Get down ! Thank you , Mitch . It 's my job . What 's happening ? They appear to be in a highly agitated state . And I , I don 't know . I honestly don 't know . I don 't know what 's going on anymore . This is frustrating . I 'm not feeling myself . If only I could hold you in my arms ! Oh , Donald ! I 'm scared ! Excuse me . You said you wanted to know as soon as possible . What is it ? It 's NO2 . Highly concentrated . Nitrogen . So that 's how it could breathe in our atmosphere . What 's that noise ? But , Theodore , I simply do not feel that Lincoln ... . It 's a full-scale invasion . We must get you to safety . Not this way ? I 'm sorry , there 's a tour going through . The Blue Room is often considered the most beautiful in the White House . It is often used by the president to receive guests . It is furnished to represent the period of James Monroe . What 's that ? That is a portrait of James Monroe . We lost Taffy ! Keep moving , we must get you to the back stairs ! The Nancy Reagan chandelier ! What are you gawking at ? Get that president out of here ! I personally guarantee that you will get a complete return on your investment within five months . Mr. Land , excuse me . Just a second , Sheik Rakula . Now even in a time of so-called intergalactic emergency the people still want to roll them bones ! I believe- - Just five more minutes . What I 'd like for you to do is to view our new , state-of-the-art show room . It is out-of-sight ! Gentlemen . There is no way that we can lose . " It 's not unusual to be loved by anyone " It 's not unusual to have fun with anyone " But when I see you hanging about with anyone " It 's not unusual to see me cry " I want to die " I 've called you all day . The flight 's been canceled . Byron , there 's Martians everywhere ! Hello ? I can 't hear you ! I must get to Washington . Do you know anyone who can fly a plane ? Your husband , Art . He 's dead . I told him this would happen . I loaded the plane with supplies . I want to go to the Tahoe caves . It 's remote , the Martians won 't find it . Where 's the plane ? Private airfield . Other side of the freeway . Will it fly to Washington ? I want to go to Tahoe . " You find it happens " All the time " Love will never do " What you want it to " Why can 't this crazy love " Be mine " Jesus Christ ! Girls , get out ! There 's a Martian right behind me ! You 're Tom Jones ! " It Ain 't Unusual . " Autograph ? Anybody got a pen ? Great punch . You 'll need that gun . - I 'm Tom Jones . - Byron Williams . I saw you fight in Cardiff , Wales . You okay ? - I need a drink . - You and me both . - We better go . - Can you fly a plane ? Sure . Got one ? She has . Don 't run , we are your friends . Martians blew up the shop ! You 're kidding . Should I get Grandma ? Forget her ! She 's halfway to outer space already ! Here ! I 'll tell you one thing . They ain 't getting the TV ! The president of France is on line two . Mr. President , the president of France is on line two . He says it 's important . Hello , Maurice . I have good news . The Martian ambassador is here . We 've negotiated a settlement . Maurice get out of the room . Get out , now ! Mr. President . Mr. President . I need you to sign this ! What is it ? My last will and testament ? It is an order to deploy our nuclear capability , sir . What the hell was that ? Look ! What was that ? Where you going ? To get Grandma . Stay and defend this trailer ! That 's what Billy-Glenn would do . You 're disgracing a hero ! I don 't care . I 'm gonna go get grandma . Come back here ! What in the hell is that ? Cut it out ! Stop it ! - This way ! - No , this way ! It 's a short cut ! The airfield 's- - Bullshit ! The airfield 's over there ! Being dressed like King Tut doesn 't make you our leader ! Look , this is wrong ! We 're lost ! He led us down a maze ! I 'm going back to the hotel . - This way ! - Wait ! Where are you going ? Come on . But , I like him . Assholes ! Why 'd I listen to them ? I should have stayed in the hotel . Shit ! I surrender , okay ? You understand what that means ? Look ! You 're intelligent beings . Let 's cut a deal . I can help . I 'm a lawyer ! You want to conquer the world , you 'll need lawyers , right ? Here . You want my watch ? Take it . Take it . It 's a Rolex ! Nice shot ! Pity I was too late . Can I have the gun back ? Give me the gun and come on ! Grandma ! Oh , my God ! I think these guys are very sick . What 's happening to them ? What 's killing them ? I think it must be my music . Quiet ! You think you can do anything you want . You can 't . Because we are human beings . And we have the United States Army that 'll fight you to the last man ! And we 'll never surrender ! Do you hear me ? We 'll fight you on the beaches . We 'll fight you in the streets . We will never , never surrender ! We will win ! Democracy will survive ! We will never , ever surrender ! We will win ! The eagle will be triumphant ! Why are you doing this ? Why ? lsn 't the universe big enough for both of us ? What is wrong with you people ? We could work together . Why be enemies ? Because we 're different ? Is that why ? Think of the things that we could do . Think how strong we would be ! Earth and Mars together . There is nothing that we could not accomplish . Think about it ! Think about it ! Why destroy when you can create ? We can have it all or we can smash it all ! Why can 't we work out our differences ? Why can 't we work things out ? Little people why can 't we all just get along ? What 's this ? Don 't run . We are your friends . Don 't run . We are your friends . Next stop , radio station . There it is ! Let 's move it ! There it is . Go start it . Go with him . Cindy , come with me . Are you sure you can fly this ? I think so , yeah . Who put that on ? - It 's stuck ! - Cindy , over here . Shit ! They haven 't seen us yet . Come here . Get in the plane . I 'll distract them . The first chance you get , go . - I 'm not leaving you ! - Just do it ! I 'll draw them away ! Go ! No ! I said go ! Oh , my God ! What 's he doing ? He 's flipped ! He 's going to throw them off so we can escape . We can 't leave him ! No weapon ! No clown outfit ! Just me ! Byron Williams heavyweight champion of the world ! Something 's happened . Something 's happened to Byron . " When I 'm calling you " That means I offer my love to you " Good-bye , my darling . I wish things were different . So do I. Good-bye . I love you . I love you too , Nathalie . Florence Norris I present to you the Congressional Medal of Honor the nation 's highest decoration . Thank you , but don 't you dare let this happen again ! Richard Norris on behalf of my parents , who couldn 't be here today for saving the world from the Martians I present to you the Medal of Honor . Don 't kiss me if you don 't want . I have to . I prepared a speech . Is that okay ? Sure , that 's very appropriate . Hi , everybody . I want to say- - Can you speak up ? We can 't hear you . I want to say that there 's a lot of people in the world that have done a lot more than I have , and they should be here now getting a medal . And I want to thank my grandma for always being good to me and for helping save the world and everything . So , I guess , like , now we just have to start over and start rebuilding everything , like our houses . But I was thinking , maybe instead of houses we could live in tepees . Because it 's better in many ways . That 's all I have to say . Thanks . Was that okay ? Yeah . Do you got a girlfriend ? No . Give me a break . Go on in there and clean your room . I can 't do this all by myself . Look at you . Subtitles provided by : Paul @ vear.co.uk

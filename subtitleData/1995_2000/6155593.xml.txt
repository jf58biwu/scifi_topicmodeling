 Name , please ? - Uh , Amy Jacobs . - Okay , Amy . Fill out your address card . And may I have the next one in line ? Carl , I need a reload . Hey , Carl . Hey ! I need more film . I haven 't loaded it yet . Why do you even bother coming in if you 're not gonna do your job ? Nobody 's gonna spoil us . Amy ? Amy ! Mom ! Hurry up with those drinks , Lucy . We 're backing ' up ! What are you doing ? These are regular . They all ordered large . What- - What happened ? Nobody 's gonna- - gonna spoil us . Nobody 's gonna spoil us . Nobody 's gonna spoil ... us . Nobody 's gonna- - Nobody 's gonna spoil us . Nobody 's gonna spoil- - Nobody 's gonna spoil- - Nobody 's gonna spoil us . [ Man ] Bushes , please . Flowers . Everything . I 'm looking for the agent in charge . - And you are ? - Special Agent Mulder . I 'll let him know you 're here . [ Man ] Can we get some shots right here along these draperies ? Mrs. Jacobs ? I 'm Fox Mulder . I 'm with the FBI . I 'm sorry about your daughter . It 's her birthday on Tuesday . We 're gonna do everything we can to find her . Who could do such a thing ? Who can take somebody who wasn 't theirs ? - I know you must be feeling- - - I 'm sorry , but how could you really know how I feel ? It 's blood . Amy had a nosebleed . Her little sister said it happened when the kidnapper ... put his hand over her mouth . We 're running it anyway . Walt Eubanks , special agent in charge . Fox Mulder . Any leads on a suspect ? A vague description from the sister . Hair and fiber pulled some promising bits , but he didn 't leave any prints . Here or in the flower beds out front . - What about the neighbors ? - Nobody saw anything . Not a car . Nothing . It was someone who knew her . That much we can figure . He knew right where he was going . No , I 'd bet that he didn 't know her so well , or else he wouldn 't have been so bold . Either way , we 're pretty much chasing our tails ... until something or someone turns on this . What about this woman at the fast-food restaurant ? - You heard about that ? - Yeah , that 's why I came down here . - Seems like a pretty thin lead . - Mind if I talk to her ? [ Scoffs ] Hey ! Save me the time . Great . Thanks . Mulder . Thought you missed your flight . We were delayed in D.C. I tried you on your cell phone- - Oh , I forgot it . I left in kind of a hurry . - Your message said something about a kidnapping ? - Yeah . Fifteen-year-old girl ... named Amy Jacobs was taken from her bedroom last night . - 10 : 00 . - Is she here ? - No , they haven 't found her . - Well , what are we doing here ? A 30-year-old woman named Lucy Householder ... was admitted here shortly after 10 : 00 . She collapsed at work , suffering from some kind of seizure ... and what her doctors are calling " glossolalia . " - Incoherent speech . - Technically , but whether she knew it or not , she was repeating the exact words spoken by Amy 's abductor ... at the exact same time , 20 miles across town . - That 's spooky . - That 's my name , isn 't it ? Turns out Lucy Householder knows a little something about kidnapping herself . When she was eight years old , she was taken from her bedroom while her parents were asleep . She was missing for five years until she escaped and someone found her by the side of a road . Apparently , her abductor had kept her locked in a basement the entire time . - They never caught him . I 'm Fox Mulder . This is Dana Scully . We 're with the FBI . We 'd like to ask you a few questions . I 'd like a cigarette . They won 't let me smoke in here . - Are you feeling any better ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'd just like a cigarette . A young girl was kidnapped last night . Have you heard anything about that ? What are you asking me for ? Do you remember what you were saying last night when you collapsed at work ? - What ? - You were saying , " Nobody 's going to spoil us . " - Does that mean anything to you ? - No . Can you think of any reason why you might have said it ? - What 'd I just say ? - Those were the exact words ... spoken by the kidnapper to the little girl when he took her . So you can see that under the circumstances it might seem strange- - So what 's your point ? All of us kidnap victims gotta stick together ? No . We just want to find the little girl anyway we can , and if you know anything- - Look , what I been through in my life I wouldn 't want to wish on anybody . Doesn 't mean I can make it any better for me or anyone else . All right . Well , thanks for talking to us , Lucy . Yeah . Hey . - When do I get out of here ? - As soon as your doctors feel it 's okay for you to go . - No , they say it 's up to you . - No . We can 't hold you here . You 're free to go . I guess she 's not too big on confined spaces . Yeah . - You 're the one that called for a tow ? - No , not me . - Gary Mosier ? - No , uh , wrong guy . [ Sighs ] While I 'm out here , I might as well give you a hand . It 's okay . We 'll be fine . Think it looks like you 're in a world of hurt . Blown sidewall . You 're gonna need a new tire . - Yeah , yeah . It looks that way . - Got a spare in the trunk ? - Yeah . - Twenty bucks cash . My boss don 't got to know about it . - Have you on the road in five minutes . - I can 't pay you . Make it ten . Pop your trunk . Take me five minutes , max . - Leave me alone ! - Hey , man . What the hell 's your problem ? Leave me alone ! Get out of here ! Lunatic ! Freak ! Agent Mulder . Lucy Householder . - You get anywhere on that ? - I 'm workin ' on it . Got one of my guys on the line . Says she 's got a criminal record . Prostitution , narcotics convictions- - - She 's done some time . - That doesn 't surprise me , given her history . She 's also got a boyfriend doing time for assault and child endangerment . Used to live with him up in the hills . Pretty sketchy characters . - I don 't think she 's involved . - Closest thing I got to a lead . I can tell him to shift some men- - No , let me follow up on that , okay ? Thanks . - Mulder . Got something . Something weird . - What ? I was going over Lucy Householder 's medical workup , and something hit me . - Her blood type is " O " positive . - Yeah ? Forensics lifted two blood types off of her work clothes : " O " positive and " B " positive . Two guesses as to what Amy Jacobs ' blood type is . How could it be Amy Jacobs ' blood ? Lucy was all the way across town . I don 't know , Mulder , but it begs the question . Because it matches the victim 's blood type ? How many have " B " positive blood , Scully ? One in five ? That 's hundreds of thousands of people in the local population alone . We 're not talking about the local population . We 're talking about a woman who 's tied to this case , who had somebody else 's blood on her . Lucy is a victim , Scully . just like Amy Jacobs . If she 's got any connection to this case , that 's the extent of it . - Well , we 'll know soon enough . - What are you talking about ? I 'm running a P.C.R. on her blood to see if there 's a D.N.A. match . - Will you keep that under your hat ? - Why ? Because I don 't want Lucy Householder treated like a suspect in this case ... until it 's absolutely certain that she is one , okay ? - Lucy ? - I 'm cold . - Brought you another blanket . - We should call the doctor . - No ! Let me see your face . - What did you do to yourself ? - It 's dark . Why is it dark ? - I can 't see . - You hold on now . - I can 't see ! Give your E.T.A. , please . Base , this is 17 . Our E. T.A. is five minutes . - Over . - How 's she doin ' ? - Fine . Blood pressure 's back to normal . - Temperature 's back up . She must have gone down the rabbit hole for a while . You should get something to eat soon . Get your blood sugar back up . Well , what do you say , Lucy ? Can I take you to dinner ? - You feelin ' better ? - Better than what ? Better than Amy Jacobs . Wouldn 't know . If anybody knows , I say you do . I got my own set of problems now , thank you . - How 'd you scratch your face ? - Must have done it in my sleep . - Are you using again , Lucy ? - I 'm clean . Passed my test last week . Ask Henry . With flying colors . Have you ever experienced temporary blindness before ? I 've probably experienced just about everything once or twice . It 's all been pretty temporary . That girl 's in trouble , Lucy . And there 's not a damn thing I can do about it . You understand ? I can 't help you . I think you can , Lucy . - How ? - Well , that 's something you have to tell me . - What can I possibly do ? - Lead us to her . I don 't know where she is . I don 't care . I 'm not interested . That 's too bad , Lucy , because right now I think you 're her best hope . If I 'm her " best hope , " then that little girl ... is in a hell of a lot more trouble than you think . What do you want ? Why are you doing this ? I want to go home ! - Mulder , I 've got- - - Scully , take a look at this . Is that Lucy ? Yeah . It was taken in 1 978 , the week she was found . She 'd been held in the dark for so long , her eyes were hypersensitive to the light . Whoever held her captive wasn 't very big on conversation either . She 's 13 years old here and can barely string two words together . It 's amazing she 's gotten anywhere in life . Well , by most yardsticks , she hasn 't , Mulder . I think we 've got a break in the case . - A big one . - What is it ? School pictures were mailed out this week to everyone in Amy 's class except Amy . - One of Eubanks ' men discovered it . - Who 's the photographer ? It 's an outfit called Larkin Scholastic . The photographer checked out , but his assistant was fired the day after the shoot . - A man named Carl Wade . - Well , what have you got on him ? DMV 's an old address , but he spent a good part of the past 15 years ... institutionalized for a bipolar condition . The only thing current we have on him is this photo . It was taken by his employer trying out a new camera . - Have you shown this picture to Amy 's little sister ? - They 're doing it right now . I 'm gonna take it and show it to Lucy . Lucy ? - Lucy , wait . - No , I 'm done with you . I just want to ask you a question . Lucy , wait a second . Don 't ... touch me . I don 't like to be touched . I 'm sorry . I was doin ' okay until this , you know ? Figures . I just want to show you a photograph , okay ? You recognize him , don 't you ? Lucy ! Hey ! Stop ! Lucy ? - Lucy ? What 's happening to me ? He 's probably changed a lot over the last 17 years . Did you even know his name ? Carl Wade . He worked as a photographer 's assistant . School pictures , mostly . That 's where he saw Amy Jacobs . So what do you want from me ? I want you to tell me what you 're going through . It might feel good to tell somebody . I feel like it 's happening all over again . You can actually feel what she 's going through , can 't you ? I don 't want to go through this again . - Lucy , she needs your help . - There 's nothing I can do . - Lucy- - Wait here a second , okay ? - What 's goin ' on ? - We 're here to arrest Lucy Householder . - Why ? - I think you know why , Agent Mulder . What the hell is happening ? Mulder , the blood on Lucy 's uniform was an exact D.N.A. match . - Lucy was covered in Amy Jacobs ' blood . - She didn 't do it , Scully . Mulder , it 's incontrovertible evidence . Agent Mulder ! - Where is she ? - She was just here . Well , she 's gone now . Please ! I-I 'm thirsty . You shouldn 't have run . I was taking care of you . I thought you understood that . - Why did you run away ? - Please , mister . I need some water ! You shouldn 't have run ! Please . I-I 'm so thirsty . I want my mom ! I don 't want to die here . Please ? Please , mister . - Don 't let me die ! - You 're gonna drive her away with this . - She 's been driven away , Mulder . A half-dozen witnesses placed her across town at the time of the kidnapping . - I 'm well aware of the facts . - Then trust me on this . She 's not working with Wade . How 'd she get the blood on her ? She may have bled it . She bled Amy Jacobs ' blood ? Yes , it may explain why there was so little of it ... - on the carpet in Amy 's bedroom . - Agent Eubanks ? - Line three . - I don 't have time for this nonsense , Agent Mulder . We 've got a young girl 's life at stake . I hate to say this , Mulder , but I think you just ran out of credibility . He 's wrong , Scully . You 're protecting her beyond the point of reason . I 'm protecting her because I think she 's connected to Amy Jacobs . just not the way everybody else thinks she is . Did you consider for one minute that the person she 's connected to is Carl Wade ? Carl Wade . Why would she be connected with Carl Wade ? For the same twisted reason that abused children crave their parents ' love ... or hostages develop sympathy for their captors . I mean , maybe Lucy developed some kind of emotional dependency . After five years in a dark pit , I 'm sure she developed some kind of connection with Wade . just not the kind that you 're suggesting . It makes more sense than the notion that she 's bleeding Amy Jacobs ' blood . I don 't how to explain it , but I think that Wade 's abduction of Amy ... triggered some kind of physical response in Lucy . - Some kind of empathic transference . - Mulder , you can 't- - That 's how I account for what Lucy 's going through . That 's how I account for the identical words that corresponded to Amy ... and the spontaneous wounds and blood as well . Then why did she run ? If she 's innocent , what was she running from ? - Because she 's afraid . - You don 't see what you 're doing , do you , Mulder ? - You are so close to this that you just don 't see it . - What don 't I see ? The extreme rationalization . Your personal identification with the victim- - or , in this case , the suspect . You 're becoming some kind of an empath yourself , Mulder . You are so sympathetic to Lucy as a victim--like your sister- - that you can 't see her as a person who 's capable of committing this crime . You don 't think I 've thought of that ? I have . Not everything I do and say and think or feel goes back to my sister . You , of all people , should realize that sometimes ... motivations for behavior can be more complex and mysterious ... than tracing them back to one single childhood experience . Agent Mulder ! We 've got a man on the way in who spotted Wade . Yeah , that 's the guy . I offered to fix his flat . Tried to do the guy a favor . He went wacko on me . Started freakin ' the minute I got out of my truck . What about the girl ? Was she with him ? I didn 't see anyone else . - She could have been in the trunk . - Can you give us an exact spot ? Yeah . Right in the middle of nowhere . - Which way was the car headed ? - West . Interstate 12 , County 15 , north . 903 . Look at this . Right off the 903 . - Easton ? - That 's where Lucy was found 17 years ago . It 's a small town , Scully . Somebody 's bound to know Wade 's face , where he lives . But we already stick out like a sore thumb , Mulder . If we start canvassing Main Street , somebody 's gonna pick up the phone . But he 's a photographer , right ? - Yeah . - He should have an account here . Go . Amy ? - Mulder ? - Yeah ? What 's happening ? Did you find her ? Where are they , Lucy ? Tell us where Wade took Amy . I don 't know . Anything happens to that girl , Lucy , and you 'll be tried as an accomplice . - Were they here when you arrived ? - No . - You haven 't seen him ? Spoken with him ? - I said no ! - Then why are you here ? - I don 't know . just showed up for no reason in particular ? That 's what you ask us to believe ? I 've been here before . A long time ago . It was where he kept me . So , why are you here now ? Take her outside and place her in custody . No . I 'll take her . Come on , Lucy . - Agent Mulder- - - It 's all right . He hasn 't touched her . Not yet . He wants to , but he can 't . That 's why he takes the pictures . What else , Lucy ? Tell me what else . If he can 't have her all to himself , that 's when he 's dangerous . That 's when he 'll start hurting her . - Lucy , you came here to help her . - No ! Why else would you come back here , if not for Amy ? - You 're sharing her pain . - I can 't . You 're the survivor . You 're the strong one . Now Amy needs some of your strength . - She 's not gonna make it . - She has to make it . And you have to help her . She 's cold . She 's cold and wet . Lucy , Lucy , sit down . Sit down . Mulder , they found Wade 's car north of here . - They 're in the water . - What ? There 's a river near here . I think that 's where they are . But the river 's east , and they found Wade 's car a mile north . Well , Wade lives here . He knows these woods . He could be doubling back . Did she tell you that ? No , but I think that 's what she 's trying to do . Mulder , wait ! Stay with her , and get word to Eubanks that Wade may be heading towards the river . Please . Stop . I can 't . Come on ! They 're comin ' ! - I can 't ! Please . Nobody- - Nobody 's gonna spoil us . No ! No , no ! Can you sit up ? Can you breathe ? Are you able to breathe ? This is Agent Kreski . I 've got what looks like an emergency medical situation . Requesting E.M.S. Over . Wade ! Federal officer ! Hold it right there ! She 's not breathing . No pulse either . One , two , three , four- - - Come on , Amy , breathe ! ... two , three , four , five- - There 's nothing . Mulder , it 's no good . - I 'm sorry . - Damn it , Amy ! Come on ! Now stop . You can 't help her . Mulder , it 's no use . Mulder , stop it . Stop it ! Mulder , stop ! Mulder ! She 's breathing . - Have you got her ? - Yeah , we 've got her . You have to get an E.M.S. unit here right away with some heat and oxygen . They 're close . We 've got them up at Wade 's place right now . They 're working on Lucy Householder . I 'm cold . I want to go home . It 's getting dark . We have to get her off the river . [ Woman On Police Radio ] Rescue22 , clear frequencies . I don 't know what happened . She started coughing , then she couldn 't breathe . By the time the E.M.S. guys got here , she was already gone . - How 's Amy ? - She 's exhausted , but it looks like she 's gonna be fine . The doctors want to keep her for a day or two , just to be sure . How serious were her injuries ? Wade must have left her alone . There were no injuries . He must have dragged her through the woods for at least a mile . I know , Mulder . I can 't explain it . She didn 't have a cut on her . And nobody wants to talk about that right now . Everyone 's just relieved ... to have her back again , to have her safe . They finish up on Lucy ? Yes , they , uh- - They brought in the state pathologist last night . So I stopped by to get the autopsy reports on my way . She drowned , didn 't she ? They found five liters of water in her lungs . She saved Amy 's life . Mulder , whatever there was between them , you were part of that connection- - did you think about that ? Lucy may have died for Amy , but without you , they never would have found her . I think she died for more than Amy . What do you mean ? I think , finally , it was ... the only way she could escape . The only way she could forget what happened 17 years ago . It was finally the only way she could outrun Carl Wade .

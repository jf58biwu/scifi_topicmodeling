With most of my fellow men . I survived . Gua know for a long time , that I have the ability to stop . Because the first test . The measures will of human . All I have done since then has been to reduce your power that hurt you fighting spirit . What do you want to say ? Think about , Cade . Despite everything that happened , you survived . You prove he 're easy to beat . I had little help . Not to mention the book of Nostradamus . Without it I would not have succeeded . Yes , Nostradamus was useful . - But no more than that . - How so ? They killed Hannah , that make you hates them . And they succeeded . If all these experiments you 've found ... They were made to uncover ? When Jordan went on to get your distraction ? Where do you want to go ? If all that happened , it 's part of a plan , their plan ? If your development as a fighter was essential to their prophecy ? Nonsense ! If Nostradamus was crazy , and all quatrains have been a test ? Enough ! - I 'm full . - Trying to prove something .

I answered Gua invasion , with most proficient of our species . Then I attacked the invaders . It was a trap . - I am sorry . - There 's no need . The death of my planet has nothing to do with you .

You have not killed acolyte who logged killed his wife ? Ba , da . Then why not stop ? I would like to can , but I try to conquer the planet . - Your planet ? - Right . My Planet . E absurd . You can not be responsible for all on this planet . What should I do ? To let us invade and exterminate the human race ? - I thought you were me ajuþi . - I 'm trying to do . And then what about " my world " and all the other nonsense ? - Gua are invaders . - Your species is any better ? At least we do not invade other planets . Worse . Humans are the only species that I met , who massacred tighten peers . Genocide has become a fun planet . I said we perfection . We make mistakes . Many mistakes ... There you can make me responsible for things that have nothing to do . However , I feel responsible for everyone on this planet . And I do on all Gua responsible for the death of your wife .

Good job . A symbol of your victory . Aims lesson . Ask questions later . You must be tired and hungry . Încearc it . Try it . E delicatesã extraterestrã of a fait ? - Something like that . - I 've never tasted anything like . I 'm not surprised . Drink it slowly . Not bad . In the battle between my race and Gua , I had the privilege to fight Gua with a great warrior . What drink is his blood . - Glumeºti , right ? - And what you eat , it 's his heart . - Gua dissolve . - Here on Earth the body dissolve ... To avoid detection doctor . Elsewhere they die , like other species . How it looks on other planets ? Terrible . Their skin is rough and full of veins . With many prominences , as a kind of armor . The eyes are leaking fluid , To protect order in any situation . - I think I 'll vomit . - I think it 's a good thing . - What is happening to me ? - Fearlessly braves , Cade . When you eat and drink the blood of a warrior heart Gua , body reacts to what you eat . But îþi îþi purifies the spirit and empowering . The power to know what you need . I see something . See ... That ... I want from you . - Welcome back . - How long was I ... ? Time is difficult to measure here . It may be hours or days . - Days ? - Uºurel , Cade . Give logged a chance to get back . Drink this . - Yeah , sure ... - It 's water . Fuck you ! You tried to get otrãveºti . I did not try to poison , but Gua . What ? They were poisoned by the desire of revenge , destroyed logged in spirit , little by little . How this change , the consumption of dead Gua ? Îþi will allow you to see things from a different perspective . Da , halucinaþii . Here , drink this . - You feel better ? - I feel ... different . You said you had visions . Describe them . It was unclear . I saw a silver metal object . - I 've seen is Gua . - Excellent . They used to travel through time and space . People think it was Thor 's hammer . When you saw your soul was pure hammer . That will be key to your success in the coming days . We 're days . Focus on what you should do , you acquire skills , teaches lessons And preparing for the final battle have your spirit . The flame symbolizes the strength of a warrior . How so ? If you have your Poth accept the power and keep it stored in you , you 'll be protected . The flame will burn 're not . Put your hand in the fire . No , thank you . The next stage of consciousness . How could burn your hand to help me in the fight against Gua ? Power is pure when not interfere with past , present or future . That 's a way to test their impact on your life . - Have you forgiven logged Gua that killed his wife ? - No ! Then how do you hope to gain with the burden of the past behind ? I will not ever forgive the murder of Hannah . And I 'll never beat Gua , until you forget the past . The past gives me a reason to fight . Only when you let go of the past , you have a chance of victory . And the only way to free yourself ... is to ierþi . I forgive . Free yourself . Focus , Cade . Free yourself . Damn ! You were honest . Forgiveness is not in your nature . There 's little time until your confrontation with Mabus . You have to put more effort . You need to concentrate better , or you and your planet , you finally fire . - How do you feel ? - Much better , you ? I 'm ready to fight . - You 're ready to exits circle ? - It 's about trust , right ? If it helps to overcome Gua are ready for anything . Keep in mind , whatever happens there 're safe only in this circle . - ... Go hunting demons . - My Demons ? Thin close . This is your pain , Cade . These are nightmares . Fears that torment you , failures , hatred , your need for revenge . What we perceive as reality becomes our reality . - Even this place ? - Especially this place . Here we stopped world to decide what defines the real Poth . You mean there is not real unless I want ? You voiced demons yourself . Poth and bring them to silence . The choice is yours . - And if I can not silence ? - I can even kill and death is real . Aºadar I hunt my demons and my demons are hunting me . You 're the predator and prey simultaneously . Be very careful . I see something ... A way out . You sound confident . How Poth be so sure ? I just felt it . I must warn you , Cade . Poth reach the light , unless you are prepared . Foster ... Foster , te-am cãutat . Joshua , what are you doing here ? What happened ? - Eddie , needs our help . - How did you get here ? - I was taken along with you . - No 're not real . What do I mean they are not real ? Foster , Eddie is dying . Where is ? Eddie ! ? - What happened to him ? - I do not know . I found it so . Then get your voice heard and I looked . Come on , buddy , wakes up yourself . You 're good ? - I do not know . - To get up . We gotta get outta here . I saw a light . If we follow believe ... Foster ? Eddie ? Eddie ! Joshua ... Burn my spirit ... My fire to bring life ! - I died . - Death here is real . - How did you bring back ? - Thi-I gave part of my spirit . - It can not happen . - Îþi are grateful ... But I feel that I learned the lesson . You 've been a stage . You found the courage to have your challenge demons . Forgiveness is the final hurdle . I ask to forgive Poth Xevallah can not do that . For most , it 's the most difficult part . It was also for me . I Poth asked to do something that is not in my nature . You 're good ? I 'll be fine , you 'll learn lessons îþi . No advance fast enough , right ? That affects you . It takes time to go through lessons . What 's in real life , and so it is here . - What 's next ? - Apply what you have learned . Anger and hatred Amorth senses . Reality is created by me . My own demons , I can beat . A true warrior must remain focused . Do not let feelings traitor to get your goals . And if other lives are at stake ? Losses are part of the game . Sometimes the price is death . I can not accept that caring for my friends is a mistake . You will find forgiveness from the wounded if your motives are pure . You mean my humanity a weakness ? I say you have to make sacrifices , And to them laºi others to sacrifice for you . Once you understand this , Free 're making the right decision when the time comes . Enters Final Battle clean , free of obligations . Poth forget the past , Cade ? Poth ierþi have your hardest enemy ? I 'm sorry but I can not . - I feel and fear . - Good . What happened , Xevallah ? What happened to your planet ? My Planet was once marveled . Full of water , like yours . Four months violet . How did it happen ? This ruin , desolation that ? When they arrived Gua came as explorers and we received we open arms . I saw no danger because in our language there is no word ... For war for conquest . But I was soon forced to teach these words . V invaded . Yes , in waves , one after another . Perhaps 100,000 soldiers acoliþi . Only that ? 100,000 ? We were less than a thousand , so I was more depãºiþi numbers . - But we fought . - One of you 100 Gua . Those who survived the first attack refused slavery . They chose death rather than to serve the Gua . And you 're the only one who survived ? Two of us have hidden in a cargo ship and we went to their planet . We avoid being capturaþi until I discovered one of their portals . - And he landed ? - Yes . You said last lesson is forgiveness . That 's why you brought me here ? Da . I do not understand . Why here ? I was hateful when he started the final battle . Angry with my people , because they were so proºti to be fool . Hooray for Gua , because they attacked us , even if it is in their nature . My comrades made me realize that forgiveness is the key . - The key to what ? - Victory . Winning ? No offense , but how Poth you say that ? Look around you . It completely destroyed . This is not your planet . I said it would . This is Earth . This is Earth . Poth ierþi to him , Cade ? Poth to her ierþi yours that were blind ? Poth to get your ierþi all the evils which they have done ? Poth have your ierþi that you let this happen ? Da . Ridicã-te ! Expect a long time now . I did everything I could for you . You have everything you need . What are you doing ? Circle that once protected you from forces of darkness ... It has now become a symbol of your limitation . But I feel as if I 'm just starting . You know everything you need . You said that you were two . - Have you two come on earth . - So it is . - A comrade . - What happened to him ? It was here earlier . In fact , I was familiar . His earthly name was Nostradamus . Waiting , waiting ... How out of here ? You will find the way . Every stone that I gave logged in logged in and out of my life I gave . My time here to end . Goodbye , Cade Foster . Wait . Xevallah . Xevallah ! Do not let you let your demons weaken the fight to come . You 're the flame . If you accept that your spirit ... You 'll be ready to have your enemies defeat . ... And victory will be yours . Foster ! - Moving and 're dead , man . Where have you been ? I thought that you abandoned me . Let them kill you ? No chance . I mean , have you gone ? The universe is a mysterious place , my friend . Man , I was about to die . I think the hour is not logged . - You 're good ? - Yeah I 'm good . Why ? I do not know . You seem ... different . I hope you 're right . Not sure if I understood everything he wanted me to learn Xevallah . Whether I know it or not , I know my body and spirit . Try again . For a strange computer , you 're doing good with engines . Someone must know something longer . - You would not leave without me , right ? - No ! No , I do that . - Joshua ... - You 're right ? Just another day , another alien another grease spot on the floor . A little respect for the enemy , right ? I am sorry . Now I know that does not make sense to fight my own demons , I must fight the battles truth . I was going torþa ... The flame now lives in my spirit . And whatever happens , I know if I let the spirit lead me I 'm better prepared than ever for the second wave . Translation and adaptation Florin ( c ) thin

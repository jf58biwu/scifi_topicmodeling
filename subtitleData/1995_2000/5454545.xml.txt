Can you tell me who she is ? I cannot see her . Who , Jarod ? I cannot remember . I cannot remember any more . is this your mother ? I cannot remember . She 's gone . She 's gone , Sydney . She 's gone . Our boy Einnad is actually Daniel Hilton Minor , One of the Center study groups in the late sixties . His file ends in 1982 . - Right after the fire in SL 27 . - That 's right . Once Raines lost in 155 , he has no place to work . So he took it elsewhere . Preliminary diagnosis : Mild Depression . What a crock ! A mild depression can always be amplified . - Brainwave manipulation ? - Um , hum . Whatever Dannie 's initial treatment , the outcome warrant drugs prescribed in increasing dosages . Let 's talk to Raines : You got a headache , lobotomies . And the perfectly treatable ... becomes the society identity disorder . Multiple personalities . Two of them we 've known : Dannie and Einnad . Looking in the mirror can be comforting to someone 's suffering from the ID . The mirror reflects the image of a unified self . My mother couldn 't save him . She tried it , Miss Parker . She tried it . But Raines got in the way . Charlie . Look what I 've found . Do you know what this is ? That 's a very very nice hat . And who are you ? Mummy ! Oh , hello , mummy . It 's ok . I 'm here to help you and Nickie . You have a cat , don 't you ? Charlie . Charlie . I bet Charlie loved to play in the alley . It that what happened the day in the laundromat ? I found him . Ok , you found him . And then a man came up , right ? Two men ? I was in the boxes . No one can see me . But you can see them . These men ... Did they look like they came from Mexico ? One of the men ? And the other man ? Jackpot ! Mr. Jackpot was with the other man ? They both had suitcases ? And then they swithed them . And that 's when that happened . Another man came . Agent Cruz . What happened next , Nickie ? They got really mad and Mr. Jackpot pulled out a gun . He shot the other man ! Then he felt on me . And I was scared , I couldn 't move . Jarod . Bingham . Then the policemen came and your mummy came , and you are ok ? Can 't you remember , honey ? Agent Bingham came with the others when mummy was talking to the police , and he was talking to you . He took me away . Kid . You tell anyone ... this is your mummy . Any progress ? Nothing . The transfer 's gonna happen tomorrow at eight thirty . Why ? Dr. Shrink 's time 's up . They want the kid over to official headquarters . What have we got ? Social divided identity disorder with both personalities are compelled to cover at living space , even if it 's within the same home . So far , we 've only found Einnad 's space . We didn 't find Dannie 's . Anyone ever tell you you are not a duck ? Duck ? Alticationly . Hey , we are running out of time . Nail this kid . And 5 Kg will be waiting in the alley , south Columbia Avenue . Run heroin from the locker . And they are going to transport the kid tomorrow night . They 'll come in van . Here is the address . I want you to make sure that transport never leave ... No problem . This better be primo junk , or I swear you 'll end up like Cruz . I checked all the doors . There are nothing . It 's not doors , it 's walls . Make him stop . Kill , Kill me , please ! Kill me and he 'll stop . I am not there to hurt you , Dannie . Manhole cover It 's time to move . Good luck . Thanks . I don 't know about you , but it 's going to be cold damn June before we 'll see the kid again ! I 'll call ... I 'll take a drive around the perimeter . - Are you ok ? - Good as paranoia ! What will we do now ? We get the bad guy . Jarod . Don 't look so shocked . I couldn 't resist about the explosion . I had to see what a little boy 's life was worth to you . What is it ? Five kg ? Ten ? These guys , they think Nickie is dead . And Vasquez is going to want his heroin pronto . I 'm going to have to kill you . Like you killed Cruz ? But before you pull the trigger , right , strongly suggest you to check out your primo junk . Chocolate . Somehow I don 't think these guys are the chocolate milk type . What is the matter , Roger ? Cat got your tongue ? Imagine how Nickie felt . He witnessed a brutal murder , as a dead body fell on top of him . Do you have any idea what that kind of fear can do to a child ? And then when it 's all over , you threaten to kill his mother if he talks . Well , he 's talking now . He 's telling Davis all about how you deal drugs , how you killed Cruz . - You 've got nothing on me . - Come on , Roger . Admit it . I can stop these guys . I have got the real stuff right here . Ok , I killed Cruz . - Give me the case . - At your service . You got milk ? Do you feel nicely ? Where did you get that ? Handball . The Tower review has been given new evidence . Something about my extracurricular activities . You should hire better people . - Smoke ? - No . You remind me of someone I used to know ... Someone who looked exactly like you . I am not my mother . Do not make the mistake of forgetting that . We should all be careful of the mistakes we make , shouldn 't we ? I 've just spoke with the hospital . Dannie has been transferred . He 's now my patient . Why would Raines have created something like him ? Maybe he was trying to make his own little assassin , but he backfired . Only God knows . God and the Center . When Dannie attacked me , my instinct was to kill him . But when I looked at him , he 's begging me to shoot him . I saw someone who might have had a chance , if The Centre hadn 't gotten its claws into him . You saw yourself . Looks like Vasquez and Bingham will be going away for a long time . Think you know a guy and find out you don 't really know him at all . Tell me about it ! Hey . Thank you for keeping her safe . I have something for you too . Charlie , you came home ! So did you , Nickie . So did you . This is Sydney . Do you think it 's possible to forget all the terrible things that happen to us when we were young ? Forget ? Oh , no . But I believe we can make use of them to make ourselves stronger . I try to be strong . But sometimes all I see is darkness , fragments of who I am . Will I ever feel whole ? I do not know , Jarod . I hope so . Me too . " Silence " End Dictation : ± ¿ ± ¿ / ´ Ð ´ Ð

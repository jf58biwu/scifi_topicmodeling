 Pyramids where Los Angeles used to be on our world . Pretty weird , huh ? Not any more weird than Hollywood . ( Arturo ) Actually , on our world it was Alexander the Great who put an end to the dominance of Egypt . Presumably , on this one it was Alexander the Not-so-Great . [ Rembrandt laughs ] Ah , here 's a paper . ( woman ) Taxi . ( Rembrandt ) Hey , this pharaoh 's funeral is big stuff . Even when a president dies , not everybody wears black armbands . Too bad we won 't be here for the procession , huh ? I think we missed it . I think that takes place when they take the body to the pyramid . Tomorrow is the ceremonial sealing of the tomb . [ Siren wailing ] " Neither locusts nor sandstorms nor gloom of night ... " [ snarling ] Come on , guys ! Keep it moving ! Let 's go ! [ Screams ] Somebody , somebody help me , please ! [ Snarling ] Help me ! Somebody help her ! ( Priest ) Nobody help her . Wade , wait ! Help me ! I 'm trying . [ Sheilah screaming ] Are you mad ? Wait a minute ... that 's it . She needs help . She is beyond help . Now ! Go ! Get her out ! You okay ? Yeah . All right . All right , it 's over now . ( Priest ) That 's right . There 's nothing for you to do but leave . The Kheri-Heb himself saw your friends touch the sacred scarab . Who is he ? Till next Pharaoh is in place , he 's in charge . That makes him a god . Take them to the pyramid . Hey ! Let go of me ! We were just trying to help ! [ Grunts ] Quinn ! That one is an excellent specimen . Take him to Dr. Achtbit . Have him used immediately ! ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . Q-Ball ? Just a minute . Where are you taking this man ? You have to ask ? The morgue . Wait right there . Hey , hey , stop ! Do you have any idea who I am ? [ Sighing ] Sheilah ? Sheilah , you 've got to tell me what 's going on . What was that thing ? It 's a genetically engineered scarab . These insects , they 're considered sacred by my people . It 's to be sealed inside the tomb along with the pharaoh and all his personal slaves . Let me guess , it 's not a pet . The scarab guards the pyramid 's riches against thieves . The slaves are its food . And now we are going to join them . No ! No ! Please ! No ! Listen , there has been a major mistake here . I don 't belong in this place ! Oh , thank God . Thank you , Professor . Where 's Quinn ? Mr. Brown , Mr. Brown is going to retrieve him from the hospital . We 'll rendezvous back at the hotel . We have to get Sheilah . We 're running out of time , Miss Wells . Damn ! Little we can do for her . [ Electronic beeping ] ( Dr. Achtbit ) The exsanguination is complete . He 's drained . ( Quinn ) What 's happening to me ? Time of death : 3 : 15 . What ? No ! I can 't be dead ! We must get Dr. Mubaric in here right away . Quinn ? Q-Ball ! Q-Ball , wake . Remmy , I 'm still here . They 're trying to kill me ! Make them bring me back . I need a medic . Remmy ! I need some help in here ! Emergency ! Q-Ball . Come on , man . Come on ! Come on ! What have you done ? Who are you ? He 's been murdered . Security ! Look , he was fine when he came in here ! You killed him ! ( announcer ) ... necrology ward . You better talk to me ! ... necrology ward [ alarm buzzing ] ( Quinn ) Remmy , I 'm dying . Hey ! Rembrandt ? [ Horn honking ] What 's wrong ? Where 's Quinn ? ( Arturo ) Mr. Brown ? When I got there , he was in an operating room . He was just lying there . He was dead . That 's not possible . I knew he was hurt but the wound was slight , not enough to ... No . I don 't believe it . I saw it . They did something to him . All his blood was drained . And they just left him there . There was nothing I could do . There was nothing I could do for him . [ Sobbing ] [ Whooshing ] [ Bells chiming ] [ Birds chirping ] Dad ? Hello , son . Oh , Dad ! It 's all right , Quinn . I thought I 'd never see you again . Where are you going ? Go long , Quinn . Come on . You remember ! What did I always tell you ? If you can touch it , you can catch it . Let me see that arm . This is what I miss the most . Just us , tossing the football together . Me , too . Dad , wait ! It 's not your time , Quinn . But I don 't want to go back yet . I wanna be with you . Have faith , son . We 'll be together someday . I don 't know how to get home . Please , help me . Remember , if you can touch it , you can catch it ! No . Don 't leave me again . I love you , son . I always will . He told me once he dreamt I was his father . I never had the courage to tell him that so often I wished he was my son . [ Sighing ] What a stupid , senseless death . If anyone should have died on this world , it should 've been me . [ Sniffles ] All of this is my fault . If I hadn 't gone down that alley ... Hey , don 't ... Don 't talk like that . Q-Ball knew what he was doing . He wanted to help that girl . ( Wade ) L ... I can 't deal with this . I need to see him . Wade ! I saw him . It won 't make it any easier . Yeah , it will . I need to see him for myself . Wade ! He 's gone ! All there is in that hospital is an empty shell . Believe me , you don 't want to see what I saw . I know it 's hard . But he 's gone . Seems so wrong sitting here grieving him . We should do something to give his death some significance . All right . You two want to do something for Q-ball ? What happened to the girl that he tried to rescue ? Huh ? They took her inside the pyramid . He gave his life for her . I think he would want us to finish what he started . We 'll use what time we have to try and save her . If necessary , we 'll slide from the pyramid . Come on . Let 's go . [ Whooshing ] [ Machine beeping ] ( Dr. Achtbit ) He 's coming back . Duration of death : Five minutes . Congratulations , Doctor . May he be the first of many . [ Beeping continues ] Welcome back , Mr. Mallory . I 'm Dr. Deera Mubaric . And we 're anxious to hear everything you 've experienced . What ? What are you doing ? Did you see colors , or people ? I have to get out of here . It 's vital that you don 't lose the images of your death manifestations . What exactly do you remember ? I don 't have time . Untie me . Please , you must remain calm . He should be as weak as a puppy . I 've got to go ! He 's not . I 'll sedate him . No ! He 'll lose memory . I 'll take it from here . But ... You 're dismissed , Doctor . [ Grunts ] Okay , I get it . You wanna know what it 's like being dead . You take me to the Chancellor Hotel , I 'll tell you everything . It doesn 't work that way . That 's the only way it works . I 've been to the other side . Nothing you do can scare me . You want my cooperation , you 'll do what I say . ( Wade ) Let me go ! New Cairo P.D. We caught the escaped slave . Don 't worry . We 'll take her in ourselves . We have 90 seconds . [ Scarab snarling ] Wait a minute . I hear that thing again . [ Snarling continues ] Over there . ( Sheilah ) Oh , thank God you came back . There 's no time to explain . In a few seconds , we 'll be leaving this city for good . And if you want , you can come with us . No . There are people here who 'll get me to safety . But thank you . Where 's your friend ? The one who saved me ? He , uh , he died at the hospital . ( Sheilah ) Died ? Was he in the necrology ward ? Yes , I think so . Why ? I used to work there . The doctors , they , they run experiments on the patients . They kill them off and then revive them hoping to learn of their afterlife experiences . Wha ... Uh , are you saying that there 's a chance he 's alive ? I don 't know , maybe . They haven 't been successful yet , but they were very close . Hold on now . He was flatlined . But he was young and strong . The others were all much older . Oh ! We have to go back and find out . Wade , there was no blood left in him . Now , we go , we miss the slide . Professor , we can 't leave . Not if there 's a chance he 's alive . If we go back , we lose all hope of ever returning home . We 'll spend 29 years here because we gambled on a miraculous breakthrough . [ Scarab snarling ] [ Electronic beeping ] [ Whooshing ] You go . I 'm staying . Go on ! Go ! Go ! I 'm staying . Mr. Brown , go ! [ Sighs ] [ Alarm wailing ] [ People screaming ] Let 's get out of here . Yeah . ( man ) He 's coming this way ! ( woman ) Hurry up ! Look out . ( man ) Grab my hand ! Follow me ! What is that alarm ? The scarab has broken loose . The pyramid is automatically sealing itself . You must stop it ! The scarab has no food , he will die , unable to defend the tomb . There 's nothing I can do . ( all ) Wait ! Wait ! ( Wade ) Hey ! [ Banging on door ] Pray that the shame of this can be washed away by Dr. Mubaric 's recent success . [ Sighs ] We 're trapped . On our earth the architects of pyramids were often buried alive with their dead pharaohs . It was not unknown for them to create a small , secret passageway to effect their escape . [ Scarab snarling ] [ Crashing ] This way ! Rembrandt ? Professor ? Wade ? Okay , your friends aren 't here . Now tell me about your afterlife experience . Remmy was wearing this at the hospital . He thought I was dead . They slid without me . What do you mean , " slid " ? I 'm not from here , Deera . I come from a parallel world . Are you royalty ? Royalty ? On our world , only royalty is allowed to travel to other worlds . No , I 'm not royalty . I 'm just a scientist trying to find his way home . Quinn , don 't do this to yourself . Whatever time you had left with them was gonna be short anyway . What are you talking about ? Your tumor . I don 't have a tumor . Quinn , Dr. Achtbit , he showed me your X-rays . We only experiment with the afterlife procedure on the terminally ill . I 'm in perfect health . I was sent to the hospital this morning because one of your leaders ordered it . ( TV announcer ) The pyramid cannot be reopened and the ceremonial sealing has been canceled . There 's no official word yet but it 's assumed an investigation has already begun and that authorities are interested in questioning the pyramid 's architect . What an honor to have you in our presence . ... architect 's whereabouts are unknown at present . The problems at the pyramid , it 's all over the news . ... three people who activated the vortex . ... has released several statements . This disaster could threaten my pending appointment to the palace in Cairo . And yours as well . I 'm going to give the media hounds something to chew on . Besides that . ... the secret passageway . The eyes of the world are on us , Doctor . Your breakthrough here this morning is going to elevate us to the positions we were rightfully intended to hold . The afterlife experiments ? But we haven 't completed our work . Just get me Quinn Mallory . I 'm calling a press conference and I want him to be there . Have Deera Mubaric ready another healthy patient for the procedure . I have camera crews on their way to film it . But if word gets out that we 're experimenting on the healthy ... It won 't matter . Success covers many evils . Kheri-Heb , Dr. Mubaric left earlier today . We believe she took Quinn Mallory with her . Contact the RDI . Tell them to sweep the city . I want them found before tonight 's press conference . Terminally ill or not , who gave you the right to play god ? You must believe me . I had no idea that the Kheri-Heb and Dr. Achtbit were doing this behind my back . That 's not the point . Quinn , for thousands of years , my people have been obsessed with the question of life after death . Is it as wonderful as I have dreamed ? Please tell me . No . What you 're doing is immoral . Why don 't you put your energy into something worthwhile ? Like saving patients , not killing them . [ Pager beeping ] ( TV reporter ) It 's not known what precipitated the premature sealing of the pyramid , but we have an unconfirmed report that an inter-dimensional transport vortex was activated inside and may be the cause of the scarab going into its rampage . Damn it ! Did Kheri have him sentenced ? When was he there ? ... and it 's doubtful that we will ever hear their accounts publicly . Right now , what we do know is that the three people who apparently activated the vortex are believed to be trapped inside the pyramid . Deera , would royalty slide from the pyramid ? Of course not . It 's done from the palace . Then those three people could be my friends . It 's dangerous out there . The Kheri-Heb has the entire RDI out looking for us . ... on this issue . And some people out here are already wondering if someone could get to them ... ( Rembrandt ) Well , if anybody built a secret passageway in here , they certainly hid it well . I said it was a possibility , not a probability . Oh . [ Laughs ] What 's so funny ? We came in here thinking Quinn was dead . Now he 's probably alive and we 're the ones who are stuck . [ Laughs ] God . Shh . [ Footsteps approaching ] The scarab ? Those sound like human feet . Who are you and what are you doing in here ? We 're locked in . Who are you ? The architect . What do you mean locked in ? The pyramid 's not to be sealed till tomorrow . Didn 't you hear the alarm ? I 've been in another part of the pyramid , working . The scarab broke loose . I think they sealed the building to prevent it from escaping . Does anybody know you 're in here ? I was gonna ask you the same question . It wouldn 't matter . I 'm supposed to die in here . Well , are you saying that there 's no way out of here ? There is another possibility . It 's a secret passageway . But we have to get to the computer room . Quickly , this way . Well , what 's the computer do ? It controls the pyramid . But there 's a way to ... No ! [ Screaming ] Wait ! It 's too late ! [ Scarab snarling ] ( Deera ) Quinn , this is crazy . ( Quinn ) I don 't have a choice . My friends are in that pyramid . But you heard the newscast . It 's sealed . There 's no way in . You believe everything you hear on TV ? I wanna find out for myself . Even if there was a way in , what about the scarab ? I 'm handling one problem at a time . Now , I have got to find the architect who designed that pyramid . You can either help me , or not . [ Siren wailing ] Let 's take my car . That looks like the computer room that guy was talking about . Looks like they were behind schedule . And it probably cost twice as much as the estimate . You know how contractors are . You see anything ? Uh , a table , chairs , a generator , and what looks like a computer . Good . All right . Step aside . ( Arturo ) Go ! You realize if the hospital finds out what I 'm helping you to do , it could damage my career ? Forgive me if I don 't have a lot of sympathy for someone whose job is to experiment with killing people . Ouch , you 're a real sweet talker . You better let me kiss up to the architect . I 'm handling this . Not home , not here . Now what ? All right . This is about to get seriously dicey . If you want out ... If I wanted out , you 'd be back at the hospital . [ Glass shattering ] What exactly am I looking for ? Blueprints , drawings , anything that might show us a way in . I found something . Nice , a copy of the master blueprint . Yes ! This indicates that there 's an underground tunnel . This whole thing was built to rotate . You hear that ? There 's a hole in the table that goes right into the model . The rotation must align the pyramid with the underground tunnel . What 's that ? It 's a timer . For sliding . But only the royals are allowed to travel to parallel worlds . He must have stolen it to use as an escape from the pyramid . Why wouldn 't he just go through the underground tunnel ? How are you doing , Mr. Brown ? Just taking some precautions , Professor . Think of it as an impromptu phaser . Good man . Listen , why do they have the stars up over here ? Oh , Mr. Brown , somewhere here is one of the keys to the great mysteries of ancient Egypt . What is the significance of the alignment of the pyramids ? I 'm in . Good . You see , I 've got a problem . We had one entryway . Now , it says if you stand here and look in that direction , you will see these constellations . These constellations . But you cannot see these constellations at this time of the year . Not in that direction . The only way you could see them would be if you ... If the pyramid rotated . How did you know that ? This computer controls the rotation . Is any of this gonna get us out of here ? Yes , indeed . If you can speed up the rotation of this pyramid , it will align us with a secret passageway . [ Computer keys clicking ] There 's a computer room . Why ? Unless the computer has something to do with rotating the pyramid , which lines it up with the underground tunnel . It must be how they planned to keep feeding slaves to the scarab . But this indicates a full rotation taking five years . [ Door slamming ] Hide ! I can talk my way out of this . Don 't move ! RDI . Let me see your hands , Doctor . Where 's Quinn Mallory ? ( Deera ) I don 't know . We got a report that both of you entered the building . He took off . I don 't know where he went . Cuff her . [ Grunts ] [ Both grunting ] [ Both grunting ] Grab the timer and the map . Come on . The closet . Let 's go . Deera ! Wade figured out the computer . Come on . ( RDI agent # 1 ) Let me check this floor . Come on . ( RDI agent # 2 ) Let 's go ! We can 't jump from here . We 're three stories up . Watch this . No ! Go ! Go ! That was insane . We could have died . Been there , done that . Let 's go . No sign of them . [ Car alarm beeping ] Give me the keys . [ Keys rattling ] [ Engine starting ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Gun fires ] ( RDI agent # 4 ) Hold your fire . We need them alive . Come on , come on , Mr. Brown . Any luck with that computer , Miss Wells ? Not that I see . We 're halfway through the entire cycle . [ Scarab snarling ] Here he comes ! ( Rembrandt ) Open the door ! Open it , man ! Close it ! He 's right behind me . Thanks ! Step back ! [ Snarling ] [ Scarab snarling ] That 's it , buddy ! Keep on going ! The kitchen 's closed ! Well done , Mr. Brown . [ Laughs ] Now , tell me that that little jaunt was worth it ? I didn 't see anything like a passageway . But I did feel the pyramid when it stopped moving . What was that all about ? L ... I don 't know . Other than that one brief stop , nothing seems to be happening . I wish Quinn was here . All right . Keep rotating the pyramid . It must be there somewhere . Okay . ( Deera ) Right here . Pull in . ( Quinn ) Give me the map . That way is north . The passageway tunnel should be about 150 feet that way . Come on . ( TV reporter ) We have no official word on how or why the pyramid is rotating , or if it 's related to the people trapped inside . And attempts to reach the Kheri-Heb thus far have been futile . You have any idea why this is happening ? No , sir . What are you doing ? Praying , sir . If you are still to attain your rightful place in Cairo , we will need a miracle . [ Phone ringing ] What is it ? No one does anything till I get there . They 've located Dr. Mubaric at the pyramid . Give me a second . Can you hear that ? We must be close . That 's the entrance . There 's no opening . There will be . It 's like a big roulette wheel . When the right slot passes over that opening , we should be able to climb inside . What if your friends don 't know where it 's supposed to stop ? They 've stopped the pyramid . There 's no opening . But that 's not cement , it 's wood . That 's got to be it . The opening 's just got to be boarded over . Wade ! Professor ! [ Banging ] Wade ! Don 't rotate it ! Professor ! Wade ! [ Banging ] The computer keeps stopping the pyramid in that one spot . If there is a secret passage , that 's got to be where it is . I 'm not going back out there unless I know for sure . Sorry . You 'll have to settle for an educated guess . I 'm reversing the rotation so I can freeze it at that coordinate . Miss Wells , perhaps Mr. Brown and I should go out . Save it , Professor . This is a package tour . We 're all going out there together . That 's it . They did it . Okay . It 's locked into place . Whatever it is . Then let 's do it . [ Grunting ] It 's wedged in from the other side . That thing has been here . I can smell it . ( Quinn ) Wade ! Hey . Did you hear that ? Professor ! [ Banging ] What was that ? Professor ! Quinn ? It 's Quinn ! This way . Quinn , where are you ? Mr. Mallory , where are you ? It was him . I know it . Mr. Mallory ? Q-Ball ! ( Quinn ) Down here ! He 's under us . I 'm right beneath you ! ( Rembrandt ) Stand back , Q-Ball ! Remmy ! Go ! Go ! It sees us ! Quick , Miss Wells ! Hurry up ! It 's right on us ! Hurry ! Hey , why is she here ? I wouldn 't be alive if it wasn 't for Deera . Quinn , we missed the slide . I know . Thanks . [ Siren wailing ] It 's the police . Can we go back that way ? Not unless you want to be tonight 's main course . I guess we better slide from here . Where 'd you get that ? It 's the architect 's escape plan . Why is it counting down on its own world ? I have no idea , Professor . Maybe the architect hadn 't planned on activating it manually . Just pray that it works . Come with us . My work is here . I can 't . And you were right , I have to put an end to those experiments . [ Scarab snarling ] That thing is right on top of us . Thank you for everything . Good luck . I 'll try and delay the police . Thank you . Are we gonna make it to the next world ? This thing is still reading 13 hours . Just have to activate it early . That means corrupting the data . That means we 'll be back to random sliding . Who cares ? Look , just get us out of here . [ Whooshing ] Go ! Where 's Quinn Mallory ? He went up into the pyramid . With the scarab loose ? How gullible do you think I am ? Forgive me , Kheri-Heb . I shouldn 't have tried to lie to you . He 's hiding at the end of the tunnel . We will discuss your future when I return . [ Scarab snarling ] [ Screaming ] [ Crunching ]

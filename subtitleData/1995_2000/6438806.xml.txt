 I 'm tellin ' you , Sally , the new bond picture 's at the $ 2.00 theater . I don 't know . I just can 't get used to bond being played by anybody but timothy Dalton . Well , you should go see that new imax movie- - " the secret life of cats . " Oh , yeah . The--The screen is huge . It 's a 50-foot cat , and you are the mouse . I swear it 'll be fun . Oh , how could it not ? Hey , where 's Rutherford Barbie taking ' you now ? We 're goin ' to the mall . It 's spring pullover madness at P.J. Harvey 's . Spring pullovers ? Oh , my god , I love the spring pullovers . Have you seen their twin sets ? They 're adorable . With the nubby v-neck ? So cool ! Excuse me , but the two of you hate each other , remember ? Those would look so great on you . Maybe if I had your hair . Oh , my god , I 'd trade for your hair any day . Yes , well , that 's all the time we have for today . See you next time . Bye-Bye . Can we come with you guys ? No . Let 's not . Sure ! Oh , great ! You know , I love that cable knits are back . You couldn 't have gone out the back way ? I never saw it coming . Excuse me . I have a special delivery package addressed to A ... birthday girl . Ooh , a video . Could this be a sexy video ? Could be . " Thirty days to thinner thighs . " You know how you 're always complaining about your chunky thighs ? Here 's A ... gift-giving tip , Dick . Jewelry says , " our love goes on forever . " Exercise videos say , " your ass goes on forever ! " Nina ! Uh ... uh ... uh ... Harry , don 't bring that in here . What ? I just carried it up 4 flights of stairs ! Get it out of here . Harry , watch- - who 's the thigh buster for ? Uh ... uh ... uh ... you , thunder thighs ! Ha ha ! Ha ! Uh , burn . It 's a lot of work for a joke , but well worth it . Take it away , Harry . Oh , Mary , guess who 's partnering up for the big badger day dance contest . Me and Judith . Oh , that 'll be great ! We 'll be practicing in my office , and we didn 't want people to get the wrong idea . I 'm a very sexual person when I dance . That sounds like fun . Do you want to enter the contest , Mary ? Ha ha ha ha ! Why ? What 's so funny ? Mary ... dancing . But Mary 's a fantastic dancer . Really , Dick , I--I have two left feet . She ain 't kiddin ' . I will have you know that my Mary has the grace of a swan , the dexterity of a hawk , and the powerful kick of an ostrich ! Mary , would you do me the honor of slaughtering them with me in the badger day dance contest ? Yes , I would . Here 's a tip for you , Dick--Shin guards . Oh , yeah ? Oh , yeah ? Well , uh , here 's a tip for you , Strudwick ... bite me ! Boy , that dance sure sounds like fun , huh ? Would you do me the honor of slaughtering that bearded guy and the glasses lady ? You know , I wish I could , but see- - come on , Nina . You said you didn 't have anyone to go with . Ok , Harry . I 'll dance with you . Yes ! Trust me , Nina , you will not regret it ! Uhh ! Oh , no . I got it . I got it . Here . Now hold it . 1 , 2 , 3 ! Unh ! Unh ! Ohh ! How can they still be in there ? How can anything take this long ? I hate the spring pullovers . I hate them . I want to kill them . All right , you guys , what do you think ? Oh , you look great ! That 's the one ! Let 's ring it up ! I want to try the purple one again . Oh , with the gray capris ! Aah ! Aah ! Cut it out . I said cut it out ! Cut it out ! Aah ! Aah . Hey , guys . Ready to go ? Oh , gee , I don 't know , Don . What do you think ? Oh , yeah . I ... suppose I 'm ready . Whew ! I got to tell you ... I finally understand what you see in Alissa . She 's fine ! She 's got great taste and a super-cute body . You--you saw her body ? Oh , yeah . We were naked in the dressing room . Naked ? ! I ... I spent a year of my life trying unsuccessfully to see her naked , and then it just falls into your lap ? Relax ! I will not ! But- - Ok , Mary ... let 's begin . And 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and ... now , what was that ? Don 't I spin into your arms ? Oh , that was spinning ? I 'm sorry . I thought you 'd lost your balance . Here . Let 's go again . And 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ... Ok , that was wrong . Yes . And 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and ... this is so wrong . How is it that women on this planet can freely look at other women naked ? I mean , the men can 't look at other men naked . Yes , they can . Trust me , it 's discouraged . So I saw your girlfriend naked . What 's the big deal ? That 's just it ! It 's not a big deal to you ! To me , it 's a very big deal ! Perhaps the biggest of all deals ! But it happens to you , someone to whom it 's a very tiny deal . Irony sucks ! Well , Tommy , have you asked Alissa if you could see her naked ? I mean , every time I 've had the urge to see a guy naked , all I 've had to do is ask , and bam ! Johnson ! All right , Harry , just watch me . We 'll start with something simple . And 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Step , step , back , step-step . No , no , no , no , no ! No ! No ! Back to one . 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Step , step , back , step-step . And--no . One question , hon . Are you a dancer or a water buffalo ? I 'm trying my best ! I don 't mean to be a bitch , Mary ... but I thought you said you wanted to win this thing . No . I didn 't . You said , " it sounds like fun . " I said , " Ok . " And all of a sudden , you 're being competitive . That 's because it 's a competition ! Now , where was I ? Oh , yes . 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . And step , step , back , step-step ! Step , step- - hey , that 's very , very bad . That 's it . I 'm leaving . And 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and step , step , step and step ! Step , step , step and step ! Now you 've got it ! Ooh . See ? It starts at 7 : 15 . Oh , this is so great ! You know what , Don ? It is so much easier to pick out a movie with Alissa than with you . I cannot believe you 've never seen a drew Barrymore movie . Never . I 'll go change . Alissa ... ahem . I need to see you naked . I know . You wrote it in my yearbook . Right . So , you want to go down to Dubcek 's utility shed ? Excuse me . Aah ! Whoa ! Just a minute ! What ... what just happened ? I just saw Don ... changing . Excuse me ? Whoo . Big finish . Yep . Whoo ! That was fun , Harry ! Well , it sure was ! Nina ... do you think it 's possible for two people to dance with each other without inevitably falling in love ? Absolutely . Yeah , me , too . Want to sleep over ? Mm-mmm . All right . She 's quite a dancer , isn 't she , Harry ? Oh , she sure is , Dick . Harry ... you remember that idea you had about me dancing with Nina and you staying home ? You know , I 've been thinking it over , and I 've decided that is a terrific idea . Oh ! Well , than--hey ! That wasn 't my idea ! Now , don 't be modest , Harry . I will dance with Nina , and you will stay home per your original suggestion . Well , but , Dick , I didn 't- - Harry , I really want to win this contest . You had your chance to win it last year , and you didn 't even enter . I didn 't even know about it ! Neither did I , Harry ! So I am dancing with Nina , and you are staying home . Now , that is an order ! Should 've entered last year . Stupid ! Sally , it 's time to go to the dance . Just get over it . No woman should see my Donnie like that . His naked body is my sacred jewel . That 's not funny , Tommy . Ohhh ... I disagree . I would suggest to you that it is very funny ! Heh heh heh ! You know , I wouldn 't laugh if I were you . I mean , now that Alissa 's seen a real man naked , how are you gonna look ? Ah , pfftt ! Come on ! Hey ... I hardly think that , uh ... I mean ... really ? Yes . Really ? Hi , hi , hi ! Hi ! Harry , what are you doing ? I lost the Tv remote . You lost it in the stove ? If I knew where I lost it , it wouldn 't be lost ! Now , would it ? ! Sally ! Tommy , come on ! We 're gonna be late ! All right , whatever . Wow ! Look at you guys ! We 're off to the big badger day dance . Hey , so Albright was Ok with you ditching ' her ? Oh , absolutely . She said if I was gonna be such a big jerk about this dance thing , she wasn 't gonna go with me . I said , " fabulous ! " Boy . I sure wish I could go to the dance . You ? ! Go to the dance ? ! Look at you ! Dressed in rags ! You 're so dirty ! Dirty ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Man ! That Dick is such a tyrant . I mean , don 't I have a right to be happy ? You know , you can go if you really want to . Me ? Go to the dance ? But how ? I got no car . I got Nothin ' to wear . Oh , Harry ... I guess you 're screwed . Cross your fingers for me , Mary . Uh ... no . Those , uh , fingers aren 't crossed . You need two , and ... I 'll explain it to you later . Sally , those shoes are awesome . Oh , you like to look at ' em , do you ? You like to look at a lot of things that belong to me . Sally , go easy . It was just an accident . You know what they say about accidents , Tommy . Behind every accident ... is an intentional act . They say that ? Oh , oh , they say that , and they 're deadly serious . Look , if anybody did this on purpose , it was Don . Oh , right . How would he know that she would burst in on him ? Unless they planned this together . Oh ! That 's the only explanation that makes sense . Alissa . Ahem . I 'm gonna go , uh ... powder my nose in the ladies ' crapper . Um ... I 'll come with you ? Come on . Women , huh ? Go to hell . What ? All right , folks , I hope you have your dancin ' shoes on , because the swing dance competition is about to begin . And may the best man win , Solomon--me . Oh , by the way , Strudwick , a gorilla called . He wants his butt , which you 're using for a face , back ! Hey ... are you swingers ready to swing ? I said , are you swingers ready to swing ? Ok , start . Harry . Dick . If you think you 're dancing with Nina , you 've got another thing coming . Screw Nina ! Oh . I 'm sorry . Dr. Albright , would you do me the honor of dancing with me ? It would be my pleasure ... Harry ! All right . Uh ... come ... come back . Harry . Harry . What happened to you ? Sally pushed me into a garbage can . It was an accident . Heh heh heh ! This is funny to you ? Oh , don 't play so innocent ! Yeah , Lolita . You 've been angling for a gander at Don 's goods for months ! What ? ! I doubt that . Ha ! As if you had Nothin ' to do with it ! I was just puttin ' on some powder ! Why do you have to go around flashing other people 's girlfriends ? Again , I did not do that . Does that make you feel like a big man ? I was just puttin ' on some powder ! Wow ! That was some hot , hot dancing ' . And right now , the judges are literally making the most important decision of their lives . Oh , please let it be me ! Please let it be me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! Me ! And the winner is ... Nina Campbell ... damn ! And Dick Solomon ! Me ! Yes ! Oh , ho , ho ! So , Strudwick ... yeah . Judith ... you were the ones who said I didn 't have a chance , huh ? We never said you didn 't have a chance . We said you and Mary didn 't have a chance . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! And--and yet , we won ! I mean , I won , which proves my point that Mary can dance ! In a way . Mary . Mary ! So , um ... tell me . Ahem . Has seeing Don ... ruined you for me ? Uh ... it may have ruined powder for me . But ... you could still enjoy seeing me naked . Sure . Really ? That 's great ! Hey ... you want to see me naked right now ? No . Trust me , Sally . I don 't want anyone but you to see me naked . Really ? Really . Actually , I don 't even want you to see me naked . Baby , I see you naked every time I close my eyes . Please stop . All right , go ahead . Nina ? I just want you to know that even though you dumped me to dance with Dick , I still think that our relationship is worth saving . We don 't have a relationship . Ah . Your mouth says no ... but your lips say yes . Ha ha ha ! Oh , and how , exactly , would my lips say y- - oh , Ok , then . Go wait in the car . Mary , wait ! Mary !

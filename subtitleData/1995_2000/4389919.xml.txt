 Paris to the Captain . Janeway here . I 've done an analysis of our route through Botha space whenever you have a minute to check it out . I 'm on my way to Engineering . I 'll be with you as soon as I 'm done . Aye , Captain . Ah , Captain . The computer told me I 'd find you on Deck 1 1 , Section 4B , starboard side and , sure enough , here you are . What can I do for you , Neelix ? I assumed you 'd want to talk to me . About ? About the Botha . We 're headed for their space , and , as I 've told you , they 're going to have to be handled very carefully . I understand , and of course I want your counsel , but , right now , I 'm late for a meeting . I wouldn 't put this off too long . We 're getting closer , you know . Yes , I know . And I will be with you as soon as I can . Sorry I 'm late . What do you have ? I think we 're about ready to make our first attempt , Captain . If you 're successful , will the Doctor be able to move freely around the entire ship ? Not exactly . The holo-emitters will be set up in certain key areas ... the Bridge , Engineering . We 'll be able to transfer him to those locations . In the same way we can now transfer him to the holodeck ? Exactly . But if he tries to move into an area where there 's no emitter field , he 'll dematerialize . I have the holo-projector on line . We 're ready to start . Proceed . I don 't have much time . Engineering to Sick Bay . Doctor , we 're ready here . I 'm standing by . Okay . Here goes . Initiating transfer . Here he comes . Well , this is certainly a brilliant feat of engineering . What happened ? I 'd guess the imaging interface wasn 't properly stabilized . Just a small oversight . No pun intended . Very amusing . How long will it take you to correct this small oversight ? Maybe a couple of hours . Mr. Kim , I have to assess our navigational plan and get ready to make contact with an alien species . I can 't drop everything whenever you call . Tuvok to Janeway . Go ahead . Captain , I would like a half an hour of your time to review the security protocols before we encounter the Botha . Yes , Mr. Tuvok , somehow ... I will find half an hour . Excuse me , Captain . Would you come down here , please ? Yes ? When did you last take shore leave ? About two months ago . Ah . How long since you 've done something pleasurable for recreation ? Doctor , I know I 'm a bit testy today , but I can assure you ... How long ? It 's ... been a while . I have a holonovel program . It helps me unwind . I haven 't had time to run it for a few weeks . Well , I want you to ... now . Doctor , I 'm really very busy . I 've checked Starfleet regulations . The Chief Medical Officer outranks the Captain in health matters . Now , I realize this may be the first time a hologram has given an order to a Captain , but I 'm ordering you to report to the holodeck ... now . Aye , sir . And the two of you can get busy undoing this ridiculous blunder of yours ! Good afternoon , milord . Will the children be joining us for tea ? Presently . Lord Burleigh ... is something wrong ? Yes . Terribly wrong . I have fallen in love with you , Lucie . Milord . Hello , Father . We 're ready for tea . I want cucumber sandwiches . You 'll wait your turn , young man . What may I serve you , milord ? Nothing . Thank you . I see . I want my tea in this cup , please , and I don 't want a cucumber sandwich . I don 't like the way Cook cuts them . Milord , you 'll be very pleased with the children 's progress in their studies this week . Henry shows a real talent for mathematics , and Beatrice turns out to be quite musical . Beatrice ? Musical ? I don 't know what she means . She 's very modest about it . I 've heard her several times in the music room , playing a lovely Mozart sonata , but whenever I ask her to play it for me , she won 't . I think her talent should be encouraged . Would you consider lessons ? I didn 't know Beatrice could play the piano . I 'm sorry . It 's just a cup . Don 't be a goose . It 's the flower cup ... Mother 's cup . It doesn 't matter ! Mrs. Templeton ! Please take the children to the nursery . Yes , milord . Come . Please stay here , Mrs. Davenport . Beatrice is upset . I should be with her . I want you here . What 's happening in this house ? How can you not know that Beatrice plays the piano ? Why shouldn 't I go to the fourth floor ? What 's up there ? Those are questions you must not ask . But I am asking them . I 'm worried about the children . Beatrice fantasizes that her mother is still alive . Don 't pursue this , I beg you . Bridge to the Captain . Freeze program . Janeway here . We 've been hailed by a representative of the Bothan government . They 'd like to talk to you . I 'll be right there . Sorry , milord . Duty calls . Captain , I knew we should have talked this morning . Tell me what you know , Neelix . I 've been in subspace contact with some old friends of mine ... uh , nomads , collectors , much as I used to be . They 're in a position to gather information during their travels . What they 've told me doesn 't sound good . In what way ? There are lots of rumors about ships entering Bothan space , never to be heard from again . My sources on Mithren say that they have lost a number of vessels . They say the Botha protect their territory fiercely . But we aren 't aggressors . I don 't think they are either . They just don 't want anyone crossing their borders . Will they negotiate ? Will they respond to diplomacy ? It 's hard to say . There 's some belief that they don 't even have a legitimate claim to the space ... that they 're nothing more than pernicious , odious vandals , in which case , diplomacy would fall on deaf ears . We 're being hailed again , Captain . On screen . I 'm Kathryn Janeway of the Federation Starship Voyager . Why have you entered our space without permission ? We didn 't realize this was your space . On what basis do you claim it ? I have no intention of explaining myself to you . The fact is , you 're violating our territory . I assure you , we mean no disrespect . We are from another part of the galaxy . We 're just trying to make our way home . We 'll send a ship to rendezvous with you . If you meet the criteria , we 'll consider your request . Thank you . What are the criteria ? We 'll discuss that when we meet . Friendly fellow . At least they 're willing to talk . I wonder why he wouldn 't let us see his face . I suspect it was a calculated move ... an attempt to intimidate us . Commander , you have the Bridge . Aye , Captain . Mr. Neelix , join me in my ready room . We should talk about this meeting . Captain , if I may ... When was the last time you ate ? Ate ? Oh , I had some soup last night . Then let me suggest that we conduct our talk in the Mess Hall . We 're serving a sumptuous repast for lunch . Right . Lunch it is . Captain , you have a nasty habit of skipping meals , and that can do horrible things to your electrolyte levels . I know , but sometimes I just get too busy to eat . All you have to do is give me a call . I 'll be there in a trice with a tray of foods so delectable you won 't be able to resist . I do think I 've outdone myself this time . An exquisite pâté made from Seltin wood fungus . Brine-soaked neccel strips . Ooh . Deviled wood throk . Where did these come from ? Lieutenant Hargrove asked for them . Is something wrong ? No . Just a funny coincidence . Something I saw on the holodeck . Thank you , Neelix . This all looks delicious . And it 's bound to boost my electrolyte levels . Where did you get that cup ? Why , I 'm not sure . I think I found several of them in storage . Unusual , isn 't it ? Captain , is everything all right ? It 's perfectly all right , Neelix . I just have to remind myself that coincidences do happen . I can 't help myself . I 've fallen in love with yo . My mother is alive and my father loves her , not you . In the course of your experiments with the Doctor , have you accessed any of the holodeck programs ? No , we 're bypassing the holodecks . Where did you get this holo-projector ? We found several of them in storage . We 've been reconfiguring them one by one . So you haven 't worked directly with any of the projectors on the holodecks ? No . Is there anything you 've done ... anything you can think of ... that might have caused holographic objects and characters to appear outside the holodeck ? Not that I 'm aware of . I was sure your experiments would explain it . Captain , there has to be a reason why you 've had these delusions . And we 're going to figure out what it is . The Doctor pointed out that I 've been under some stress . I can 't ignore that . I think we should check out the imaging systems on the holodeck . There might be a simple malfunction . Good idea . We can run the diagnostic from here in Engineering , but you should activate the program first . I 'll contact you from the holodeck . Janeway to Engineering . Torres here . Have you set up the diagnostic ? We 're ready , Captain . Go ahead . Lucie ! Thank God you 've come back . Why are you dressed so strangely ? It 's ... a costume . You 'd look lovely in anything . I 've thought of you constantly . Remembered your touch ... your perfume ... your lips . Computer , delete character . Torres to Janeway . We 're finished , Captain , but we didn 't find any malfunctions . Recalibrate and try it again . I 'm going to check something else . Aye , Captain . Captain ! I 'm delighted to see you . Do you want a snack ? No , I 'm fine . But I wanted to ask you about lunch . Didn 't you like it ? It was delicious . I was just trying to remember all the dishes you made . There was ... the Seltin pâté . Delectable . The neccel strips . Exquisite . The deviled throk . Sublime . And the cucumber sandwiches . Cucumber sandwiches ? Weren 't there ... cucumber sandwiches ? I don 't even know what that is . The other item on the menu was a fried mrt cake . You ate one . And the cup you served my tea in ... ? One of these . The ones I found in storage . I thought ... it had flowers on it . Flowers ? Well , no , I don 't see any flowers . Maybe there was another cup , but l-I don 't think so . Would you like a cup with flowers on it ? I 'm sure I could replicate one . It 's all right , Neelix . You 've told me what I need to know . I don 't detect anything so far . No evidence of aneurysm ... subdural hematoma ... stroke . Could it be ... stress ? Possibly . Did you go to the holodeck , as I ordered ? Yes . And was that relaxing ? It was interesting . I 'm not sure how relaxing it was . There are other possibilities we should consider . I want to scan for airborne bacteria and viruses . We should investigate the possibility of an alien intruder . And I 'd like to do a cerebro-cortical scan on you . Oh ! Kes ? I ... I don 't know . Strange . Suddenly , I felt cold , shivery . Someone was walking on your grave . Hmm ? Just an old saying on Earth . A way of describing an odd feeling like that . Hmm . How macabre . It 's a human expression , Doctor . I 'd think you 'd have heard it . My programmers didn 't clutter me up with pithy Earth trivia . They programmed me with far more important data . Kes , would you please get my sub-neural scanner from the med lab ? Yes , Doctor . What about my mother 's grave ? There 's no one inside . The coffin is empty . Doctor . Doctor . Who do you see here ? I see you . And I see you ... but I also see a little girl from my holodeck program . What happened ? I 'm not sure . The image of the little girl suddenly rushed at me . I saw it , too . When I came in ... I felt as though something hit me ... bounced off me ... then I saw the little girl moving right into you . As though you became a mirror . You reflected her back toward me . I 've been doing some mental exercises with Tuvok developing my telepathic abilities , but we haven 't done anything like this . Captain , until I am able to determine the cause of these hallucinations , I 'd prefer that you return to your quarters . Get some rest . Vegetable bouillon . No , cancel that . Coffee ice cream . Hello ? Is anyone there ? Computer ... is there anyone in these quarters except me ? Negative . Kath , are yo there ? Who 's that ? Come look at the pppies . Mark ... I 've missed yo so mch , Kath . When are yo coming back ? I don 't think yo 've missed me . Someone else is in yor thoghts now . Isn 't that tre ? Isn 't there someone yo 're thinking of ? Computer , open the door . Everything was fine until you came here . I took care of him . He trusted me , but when you arrived , all that changed . Janeway to Security . Intruder alert . You 've done nothing but cause trouble . We don 't want more trouble in our lives ! Security to the Captain 's quarters ! Tuvok , please respond ! Captain ! Can you still see the hallucination ? Yes . The woman with the knife is receding into the Captain just like before . Captain , listen to me ! You are in Sick Bay . You are all right . Captain ! I think Neelix can help you . No one knows much about the Botha , but he has some information . I know he 's been doing research . I 'll check with him . You 'll probably want him on the Bridge with you when their ship arrives . Good idea . I 'm not sure how Torres and Kim are coming . You know they 're trying to find a way to transfer the Doctor out of Sick Bay . Yes . It 's not a priority , but you might want to stay on top of it . Of course . Let 's see . There was a problem with one of the deflector shields . You 'll want to follow up on that . And Stellar Cartography was hoping for a review of their latest report . I think Tuvok wanted to discuss something about weapons storage ... Captain . You 've trained your crew well . We 'll be able to do without you for a few days . In the meantime , we 're continuing diagnostics on all ship 's systems . There 's a reason for what 's happening to you and we 're not stopping until we find it . Thank you , Commander . My patient has to rest now . I 'm sure you 'll want to get to the Bridge . Call me if there 's anything I can do . Just be sure to report to me after you meet with the Botha . Yes , ma 'am . Captain , if you 'll take a seat on one of the beds , I 'd like to do some further tests . Kes , please prepare the Captain for a cerebro-cortical scan . Certainly . Captain , I saw your hallucination again . What did you see ? You were struggling with a woman . She had a knife . She was trying to hurt you . - That 's right . - As I focused on you , it was just like with the little girl ... the image seemed to reflect off of me and move back into you . Your telepathic abilities must be increasing . I think it 's more than that . I think something strange is happening on this ship , and it 's not just happening to you . I am picking up a ship on long-range sensors , Commander . It is a design we have not encountered before . I show it on a direct intercept course . That must be our welcoming party . They 're in a hurry , too . Closing fast . They are hailing , Commander . On screen . Where is your Captain ? She 's not available right now . I 'm Commander Chakotay , the First Officer . I can speak for her . We observe rather strict protocols . I 'd prefer to negotiate with the Captain . I understand , but she 's not able to come to the Bridge now , and in her absence , our protocols allow me to assume her place . Our request is the same . We 'd like permission to cross through your space . We 'll do it as quickly as possible . What kind of weapon systems do you possess ? I 'm not sure why that information is necessary . How do I know you aren 't a heavily armed invader , here to attack our settlements ? I don 't know how to convince you , but we 're a peaceful people . If you doubt us ... What happened ? I terminated the transmission , Commander , and made it look like an accidental interruption . I am concerned about some anomalous sensor readings . I 'm getting them , too . Residual energy displacements . Two discrete readings ... one off the port bow , one off starboard . We have to consider the possibility of cloaked ships . Reverse course , Mr. Paris . Aye , sir . Two ships de-cloaking . The Bothan ship is powering up weapons . Evasive maneuver gamma five . Report . Shields at 87 percent . Minor damage on Decks 4 and 12 . They 're turning back for another strike . Initiating evasive pattern beta two . Get the weapons on line . Powering up lateral phaser arrays . Shields down to 83 percent . Return fire . A direct hit . However , their shields were not penetrated . I can 't stay here . Captain , I can 't allow you to leave Sick Bay . - You 're in no condition ... - Sorry , Doctor . If we 're in trouble , my place is on the Bridge . There 's something weird going on , Commander . I 'm not reading any life signs on the two ships that just de-cloaked . There 's no crew ? It looks like the ships are automated . They 're being controlled by the Bothan ship . Return fire , Tuvok . We have hit their weapons array , but not severely enough to disable it . Commander , the three ships are maneuvering to surround us . Get us out of here , Paris . I 'm trying . The ships are powering their weapons . Preparing to fire . That last volley took our shields down to 21 percent . We 've got damage on all decks . Reports of injuries . All stop . The lead ship is hailing us , Commander . On screen . Your ship is damaged and your Captain incapacitated . I will accept your immediate surrender . You 're not getting one . The Captain is fine . I don 't think so . I think the battle is over now . Mark . Don 't you recognize the man you love ? Mr. Paris , who do you see on the viewscreen ? It 's ... my father . I hope you 've been behaving yourself . I see my girlfriend , Libby . Mr. Kim , shut down visual . I 'm trying , Captain . It won 't terminate . Mr. Tuvok , do a multiphasic scan on those ships . I want any evidence of defensive weakness and prepare the forward photon torpedoes for launch . Tuvok ? I do not understand how this can be . Don 't try to understand , Tuvok . Just accept it . We 're together again . No . You are not my wife . Of course I am . I 'm T 'Pel . And there , right in front of you , is your lute , the one you used to play for me . And look ... look around you . You 're back home on Vulcan . Tuvok ? Tuvok , answer me . Tuvok ! Captain , I 'll do it . Running a multiphasic scan . Torres to the Captain . Janeway here . We 're having problems down here . People are becoming delusional . It 's happening here , too . I think I know why . There 's a massive energy field coming from those ships . It 's bioelectric , modulating on a delta-wave frequency . It has psionic properties , and it 's permeating the hull . A psionic field has a psychoactive effect . That would explain the hallucinations . You can try remodulating the shields , but , in the meantime , I 'm going to set up a resonance burst from the warp core . That 'll probably block the field , but it 'll take a while to set up . Notify the Doctor . If the field is bioelectric , he might have some ideas how to neutralize it . Commander , give Lieutenant Torres a hand in Engineering . Mr. Neelix , if the crew ever needed a morale officer , now is the time . See if you can help . Aye , Captain . Kath , do you always have to be the Captain ? Can 't you relax for a minute ? I want to talk to you . Mr. Kim , remodulate the shields on a rotating frequency . Janeway to Kes . Yes , Captain ? Can you come to the Bridge ? I think we could use you . Right away . Paris , are you still with me ? Sure am , Captain . I 'm running the scans on those ships . I 'll work on the shields . I suggest you don 't look at the viewscreen . It 's not even tempting . How 's it going down here ? Not good . I can 't get a response from anybody . It 's like they 're catatonic . It 's the same all over the ship . On my way here , I must have seen 50 people just sitting , staring . A few minutes ago , there was a momentary interruption in the psionic field . Were there any indications that the alien somehow came on board ? I 'll find out . Chakotay to Janeway . Chakotay to the Captain . Please respond . Chakotay to anyone on the Bridge . Kim , Paris , anybody ! We may be the last ones left . What do we do ? I think we should take an escape pod . We passed an M-Class planet yesterday . The pod should get us there in a week . We can try to get help . A week ? That might be too late . It may be our only hope . If we stay here , we 'll end up like the others . No . I have to keep trying to set up the resonance burst . Do I have to give you an order ? I can 't believe you 're saying this . You know we have to stay here and try to help the others . I want you with me . You aren 't Chakotay . I 'm the Chakotay you want me to be . The one who loves you . This is what you want , isn 't it ? The secret you 've been keeping ? You want us to be together . And we can be . I have to help the others . I want you . I 've always wanted you . You feel the same way , too . Yes ! Captain , I 'm getting results from the scans . No apparent defensive weaknesses . Metallurgical analysis is inconclusive . I can 't remodulate the shields . Try moving us out of here . If we can get some distance between us and those ships , we might be able to block the effects . Yes , ma 'am . This time , let 's see if you can do it without causing an accident . You usually manage to make a mess of everything you do . Let me say something I 've always wanted to say . Get out of my life ! I 'm just telling you what you already know . When the going gets tough , you crumble . Not anymore . Not anymore . You don 't really believe that in your heart . You believe you 'll fail again and , of course , you will . You can 't do anything right . You 'll fail . Why even try ? Tom ? Tom ? Janeway to Engineering . Janeway to Torres . Are you there ? Engineering , respond . If anyone in Engineering can hear me , I 'm on my way . Computer , put the Bridge controls on security lockout . Deck 1 1 . Now maybe you have time to talk to me . You 're so strong , Kath . It 's one of the things I always loved in you . What 's the matter ? You used to love it when I kissed you there . I don 't know who you are ... what you are ... but I won 't let you touch me . What about the man on the holodeck ? You didn 't seem to mind him touching you , did you ? In fact , I think you liked it . Now I ask you , Kath , is that fair to me ? I 've stayed faithful to you . I 've vowed to wait for you no matter how long it takes . Shouldn 't you do the same ? I haven 't been unfaithful . Oh , Kath ... Sick Bay to Engineering . Lieutenant Torres , please respond . Doctor to the Mess Hall . Mr. Neelix , are you there ? This is the Doctor to anyone on the ship . If you can hear me , please reply . Either the communications system is malfunctioning or everyone on board has succumbed to a delusional state . Except you and me . It would appear that , if the psionic field is to be blocked and the crew restored to normal , it 's up to us . You will have to go to Engineering and complete Lieutenant Torres ' efforts to create a resonance burst . I don 't know how to do that . I will assist you from here . Do you know how to do it ? I ... discussed the matter with Lieutenant Torres . I think I understand the basic principle behind her plan . How hard can it be ? All right . Go to Engineering immediately . I 'll contact you there . Tom , what happened ? A plasma leak . Caught me in the face . Help me . Can you get to Sick Bay ? The Doctor is there . Come with me . I can 't , I have to get to Engineering . You can 't leave me like this . It hurts ! Tom , you can walk . You have to get to Sick Bay on your own . Kes , please . I can 't . You don 't want me to get to Engineering . No . I 'm ... I 'm hallucinating . Kes ... wait ! Come back ! Don 't leave me ! Come back ! Finally . What took you so long ? Doctor , we have to set up this resonance burst as quickly as possible . I 've started hallucinating . Then see if Lieutenant Torres' last program is active . I think I have it . B 'Elanna was writing a program to open a symmetrical warp field . All right . You 'll have to sequence the magnetic plasma constriction to the following formula : T = c sub one over theta times p sub e . How do I do that ? I 'm not sure . Wait a minute . I 'll see if I can access Starfleet 's interactive database . Sweeting ! Thank goodness I found you . Are you all right ? Where have you been ? In the Mess Hall trying to help the poor souls there . Why didn 't you answer the Doctor 's hails ? I didn 't hear them . The com system must be down , and , frankly , I was a little busy . Ashmore thought I was a Kazon . Tried to kill me with a carving knife . How do I know you 're really Neelix ? Who else would I be ? Kes , all I want to do is protect you ... to keep you safe . We have to get away from here ... get to my shuttle . Doctor , have you figured out how I can enter that sequencing code ? It 's quite simple really . Do you know where the command module is ? Of course . Activate it and select " magnetic plasma sequencing . " You 're becoming annoying . l-I 've got it . It 's activated . Now it 's asking me to enter the core temperature . Move away from that console . Now , we need a temperature high enough to emit the resonance burst , but not so high as to irradiate everyone on the ship . Try three million kelvins . Kes , look at him . It hurts ! Look at him . Focus . I can 't . Yes , you can . The mirror , remember ? It hurts too much ! Kes , look at him . What 's the matter , Kes ? Can 't lift your head ? Focus . Stop it ! I 'm all right now , Doctor , and I 've entered a temperature of three million kelvin . Then all you have to do is activate the warp field . All right . Here we go . Kes to the Captain . If you can hear me , please report to Engineering . What happened ? It 's a long story , but I think everything 's all right now . Is that who 's responsible for all this ? Apparently . He looks so harmless . It 's hard to believe he almost destroyed us . You 're a powerful little thing . I must say , you surprised me . Why did you do this to us ? Because I can . Is it just telepathy , or is there technology involved ? Does it matter ? Oh , it matters to me , because I don 't intend to let you continue preying on others . How would you propose to stop me ? We could destroy your technology , or adjust your brain wave patterns to prevent telepathy , and then we could turn you over to the government of Mithren . We could even keep you confined in our brig behind a force field . I 'm sure you 're very well-intentioned , Captain , and I 'd like to be able to accommodate you ... but , you see ... I 'm not really here . Captain 's Log , supplemental . We have no explanation for the mysterious disappearance of the telepathic alien . We can 't even be certain that he was actually here . He seems to have left us with any number of unanswered questions . I 'm surprised to see you here , Captain . Isn 't this the day that you 're usually in the holodeck with your novel ? I thought after our recent experience that I 'd take a break from fantasy for a while . I don 't blame you . I think ... it had quite an impact on all of us . Do you think it 's true ... that the alien was reading our minds , creating images from our own experiences ? It seemed that way . He had an uncanny ability to ... bring buried thoughts out into the open . Why ? Oh , it 's just ... I experienced something ... I 'd rather not admit . I know . Me , too . But in a way ... maybe he did us all a favor . Maybe it 's better to ... look those feelings in the eye than to keep them locked up inside . I guess . I 'll have to think about that . Well , I have an early watch tomorrow , so I 'd better turn in . Good night , Captain . Good night , B 'Elanna . Sweet dreams . Thanks . You , too .

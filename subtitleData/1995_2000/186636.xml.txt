 [ Generator sputtering ] [ Generator sputtering ends ] ( man ) The generator . No , don 't quit on me . Not now ! [ All hollering ] Oh , no . Come on . [ Growling ] [ Glass breaking ] [ Grunting ] [ All growling ] ( man ) No ! Ah ! [ Man screaming ] [ Whooshing ] [ Maggie screaming ] ( Maggie ) Damn . ( Wade ) Quinn ? Hey . You all right ? I don 't even want to talk about it . Ever . From now on , I really don 't care where we land . Just as long as no one actually sees us coming out of the wormhole . I thought you didn 't want to talk about it . ( Quinn ) Look at this guy . Oh . Gross . [ Screams ] Hey , hey ! Get off of me ! That guy bit me . Talk about your bad neighborhoods . Oh , my God ! It 's too bad it 's not Rickman 's remains . Looks like some kind of animal attack . ( Rembrandt ) Wild dogs , maybe ? Wild dogs with gold-filled human teeth ? ( Wade ) Oh , my God ! ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice-over ) Sliders . Wade , the thing 's not gonna get up and come after us . It 's dead . You saw those eyes . Dead might not be dead on this world . He was feeding . He was gonna eat me raw he was so hungry . Great . Cannibals . You know , if you didn 't ditch my gun on that last world , you wouldn 't be so scared now . Look , I told you , I didn 't touch your gun . I 'm still glad you lost it . I didn 't lose it . Someone took it . Maggie , back off . Either that tooth back there came from an old man , or that guy lived one hell of a hard life . My guy had all his teeth . I got his dental records in my calf . You must be in a lot of pain . Looks worse than it is . I guess this means he 's not feeding alone . Let 's get moving . ( Wade ) Yeah , good idea . I feel like I 'm trapped in a bad Roger Corman movie . Are there any other kind ? This leg is killing me . That has to be looked after . It may need stitches . I don 't think it 's gonna happen here . We slide in 28 hours . I 'll take care of it on the next world . ( Rembrandt ) There are creatures hanging back in the shadows . I can feel them watching us . ( Maggie ) That must be what the security lights are for , to scare him off . It looks like they 're sensitive to light . ( Quinn ) Survivors wouldn 't waste any power they didn 't have to use . Maybe it 's not on . ( Wade ) Quinn , don 't . Hold it , man . I 've got to . This bite is startin ' to throb . I need something for it . [ Screaming ] ( Wade ) No ! That stunt is so old . Didn 't he used to be a little bit more mature ? No . ( Wade ) Someone 's up there . ( Maggie ) Come on . ( Maggie ) Look out ! ( Rembrandt ) Look out , man . [ Growling ] Quinn ! Quinn ! ( Maggie ) Get him in the light . Get him in the light ! ( Maggie ) It hurts him ! He doesn 't like it ! [ Generator sputtering ] ( Quinn ) Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Anybody home ? Looks like Bennish 's room back in college . Maybe drugs are what turned everybody into monsters here . I don 't see anybody . I 'm tellin ' you , I saw someone . Yeah , well , maybe you saw somebody in your head . Let 's go this way . Who made you boss ? You know what 's goin ' on with her . She lost someone . So hold it till downtime , and then deal with it . There is no downtime for us . Everything 's treated on the fly . Something Wade 's mastered . All I see is weakness . I see her whining . Maybe that 's how it seems now , but when you start dealing with the loss of your husband , you 'll see how much strength it really takes . No , don 't compare us , okay ? She 's all broken up over some old guy she wasn 't even related to . Don 't you ever talk about him . You didn 't even know him . ( Rembrandt ) Wade , come on , pull it together . If this is part of her on-the-fly therapy , it 's a dead end . Next time , you get hurt . Not much of a threat . Guys , look , let 's put this out on the table , or else we 're not gonna survive here , all right ? All I 'm about is survival . And if I can keep focused , so can she . For how long ? We 've been doin this for three years . She 's makin ' my point . Your system sucks . Rembrandt , you were in the Navy . Why don 't you help me out here ? It takes more than a military mindset to survive sliding . Rembrandt 's right . You face some weird parallel world all shut off like you are , and you are gonna snap . [ Generator sputtering ] Someone 's up there . Maybe it 's all in your head . Ask me , you 're just goin ' soft . ( Maggie ) You guys hang back . Hello ? Don 't be afraid . What makes you think it 's ... it 's not just another one of those freaks ? Move , and I 'll blow your head off . ( woman ) Get that damn light out of my eyes ! Those creatures forced us in here . Easy does it . No one needs to get hurt here . I counted four of you . The others are downstairs . Come closer . Slow ! You , too . Let me see your eyes . You 're not infected . Would you mind getting that gun barrel out of my face ? Look , we have no idea what 's happening here . [ Generator faltering ] My generator 's going down ! What time is it ? ( Quinn ) 5 : 45 . It 's almost daybreak . We 're all right . Thank God . It 's been weeks since I saw anyone normal . I 'm worried about my friend . He was bitten . I knew it . Of course , you know what that means . He 's gonna need a doctor ? What 's wrong with you people ? The hospitals were overrun weeks ago . We 'll have to treat it here , then . You can 't . He 's one of them . No , I 'm a stranger here . I don 't have anything to do with this . The rest of us can survive . If we fix my generator ... It 's too late for him . It 's over . Stop saying that , okay ? Tell us where the hospital is . We 'll take him when it 's light . Look , you take me to the hospital . I 'll come back and fix your generator . All right . But I want your word that you 'll be back . ( Rembrandt ) This place looks more like a war zone than a hospital . Put some on . We 're gonna be knee-deep in death in there . You better let me hang onto that 12-gauge . Fat chance . I 'm a trained soldier . We 'll all be much better off if that weapon were in my hands . I don 't care . You 're not gettin ' my gun . Come on , let 's go . ( Debra ) I 'll watch your backs . ( Debra ) I told you , there 's nobody left . ( Rembrandt ) Yeah , we 've looked everywhere . ( Debra ) I know it sounds cruel , but this is the stage where my boyfriend hung himself . It was the right thing . ( Wade ) Will you shut up ? Look , you haven 't seen what I 've seen . People devoured by their own families . I 'm gonna fight this . Look at his eyes . Infection 's only part of it . My boyfriend did this to me , and I lived . I 'm immune or something , but your friend here is gonna lose control , and that 's a threat to all of us . ( Quinn ) I can beat this , Maggie . [ Growling ] Maggie ! Stay down ! [ Screaming ] Ugh . You want this back ? No , uh , you hold onto it . Whatever we do , we 're in this together . Rembrandt , you gotta get that generator working . Your lives depend on it . We 're not leaving you alone . Beckett 's staying with me . I need someone to watch my back while I find a cure for this thing . Don 't make this any harder . It 's better this way . Not if you let us down . He saved my life . I want this payback to be over and done with . ( Quinn ) You 're costing me time ! Get away from me now ! Go on ! Can 't you see he 's trying to protect you ? If he 's gone , too , there 's nothing left to protect . Oh , save the self-pity . Come on , let 's go ! They 're gone . You okay to work ? Give me two hours to find something to go on . No more . Then I 'm gone . Not before you kill me . That 's why you 're here . Last resort . I got it . Stay here . Quinn , where are you going ? [ Quinn screaming ] Mallory ! Quinn ! Quinn . [ Ignition sputtering ] [ Ignition sputtering ] Okay , gas it now . [ Engine revving ] You 're risking all of our lives for nothing . Look , you don 't know for sure how far all of this has spread . No , but it 's obvious , isn 't it ? There 's no phone service , no radio . That should tell you somethin ' , doesn 't it ? That there might be a doctor out there somewhere . Now , we 're going to the next hospital , with or without you . It 's too dangerous . You want that generator fixed in time ? You give us directions , sweetheart . I 'll tell you how to get there . ( Debra ) It 's about five miles west . Stay on the main road , then turn left on PCH . You 'll see it . Hey ! ( man ) Stay there ! Just listen . Open the door ! I 'm a doctor . Then open the door . A man in here needs help . You 're the one that matters . Look , you must cooperate with me . It 's crucial . What did you inject into him ? It 's just a sedative . I 'll provide you with more so he stays out . Doctor , you don 't have to be afraid . I 'm not infected . I 'm not afraid of you . I 'm afraid for you . [ Coughing ] You one of them ? Not quite . [ Coughing ] ( Maggie ) Doctor ? Doctor , are you there ? ( Dr. Tassler ) Fill it with your blood . What for ? Your blood has a natural immunity to the bacteria . I can isolate the antibody . You don 't understand ... Please , just do as I say ! Listen to me ! I was never exposed . You can 't be sure of that . Trust me . I can explain . I wasn 't here . [ Coughs ] Doctor ? Doctor , you 've warned me . Now , open this door ! ( Maggie ) Doctor . Look out ! [ Banging on door ] The bacteria was engineered to attack fat . Along with the antidote , it was marketed and sold as a weight-loss product . The bacteria was actually sold to people ? Over the counter . It was called Lipron . ( Maggie ) These patients ate their own tongues . ( Dr. Tassler ) Yeah , well , the swelling makes you feel like you have no choice . Your friend might already be at that stage . Sorry , I 'm fresh out of croissants . Anyway , when the antidote didn 't work on me , I called the Lipron company , Geni-Trax . And they were already into this whole insurance song and dance , and I sensed the trouble coming . That 's when I had that door installed . And I strengthened the antidotal compounds myself and began taking mega-doses . But meanwhile ... Yeah . Meanwhile , out there ... [ sighing ] I called it the Lipron food-chain reaction . [ Coughing ] No military intervention ? Lmpossible . I acted immediately , and still it almost got me . My fat cravings are only now reaching normal levels . But you 're still not cured . [ Chuckles ] No , no . Maybe it 'll work on Quinn . You do mean the antidote ? [ Chuckles ] Well , it won 't cure him . And to get any results at all , he 's gonna need much bigger doses . [ Dr. Tassler coughing ] [ Engine silenced ] Let 's do it , huh ? ( Wade ) My flashlight 's dead . Look , there 's no one here , either . We 've got to find another hospital . Wade , I 'm thinkin ' that Debra was right . There are no doctors left . [ Zombie growling ] Wade , Wade ! [ Zombie groaning ] Let go of me ! ( Rembrandt ) All right . It 's all right ! It 's okay . [ Sobbing ] Come on , come on . Come on , now . It 's all right . Come on , now . You gotta get yourself together , okay ? All right ? Even if you 're feelin ' lonely , okay ? Everything 's just so different , you know . I just don 't know if I can handle it . I feel like I 'm losing everything to her . You and Quinn . Maggie ? [ Chuckles ] Hey , now , you know better than that . Come on . Maybe she 's right . You know , maybe I should be doing it her way , if it would help you guys . What , survive ? Yeah . Hey , I want to do more than survive . I mean , this is ... this is our life . You know , not some military mission . Come on . You know , part of you wants to lose us . Lose us so that , uh , we won 't be taken away from you like the Professor was . That doesn 't make any sense . Well , that way , you don 't feel any more pain . It 's kind of like givin ' us up for adoption , but it 's killin ' you that Maggie gets us . You 're even crazier than I am , Rembrandt . [ Chuckling ] It 's not us , sweetheart . It 's the lifestyle . Come on . Here , hold this . I 'm gonna check the bag . [ Grunts ] You really think we need all that stuff ? Maybe we should go through it and figure out what we should bring back to Quinn , huh ? ( Rembrandt ) There you go . [ Chuckles ] We need this . It 's research on the infection . What do you think ? Take it . You 're right . It is the lifestyle . [ Zombie growling ] ( Wade ) Remmy ! [ Zombie growling ] Run ! Run ! At least you won 't bite nobody else , sucker . ( Maggie ) I just thought of something . ( Dr. Tassler ) What ? One of the women that was here earlier , her name is Debra , she thinks she 's immune . Why didn 't you say something earlier ? I 'm no doctor . I just put the whole thing together . Using someone 's antibodies isn 't generally one of my main concerns , you know . ( Dr. Tassler ) Look , you have to take me to her first thing in the morning . Don 't worry , he 'll still be unconscious . That sedative lasts at least 10 hours . I 've underestimated him before . He 's incredibly strong-minded . Some sedative . Mallory ! [ Engine popping ] [ Engine falters ] [ Ignition clicking ] Can you fix it ? Wh-what 's so funny ? [ Rembrandt laughing ] [ Groans ] You know what ? ( Rembrandt ) I just don 't see people swallowing bacteria on purpose . It 's no crazier than liposuction . [ Chuckling ] Ow . Oh , well , girl , we 're walking . It 's almost dark . [ Chuckling ] It 's gonna be like a free lunch out here . Well , I don 't know what you 're worried about . Remmy , it 's almost night . Have you seen yourself lately ? As skinny as you are , they 're gonna think you 're one of them . [ Chuckling ] ( Wade ) What is so funny ? Wade , I gotta laugh to keep from cryin ' . Come on , now . Look , I thought you had a handle on this . Quinn 's all we need to be worried about right now , okay ? Well , I 'm worried about Quinn . I 'm worried about myself , too . But we don 't make it without you , all right ? Just what I need . More pressure . That 's how people get past things like that . The feeling that we gotta depend on each other for everything . You learn that in the Navy ? Oh , great . I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Sorry . You gotta know that that was about Maggie . All right . Look , you 're right , okay ? About everything . I see what you mean about what I was thinkin about wantin ' to lose you somehow , but I really don 't . Especially not to Maggie . Definitely not to her . Well , you don 't have anything to worry about , okay ? Okay . [ Zombie growling ] Except for those two creatures at 2 o 'clock . Just don 't use military terms , okay ? All right . Just keep movin ' . [ Generator faltering ] [ Zombies growling ] Deal with this , you freaks ! No ! No , leave it alone ! [ Generator sputtering ] You fixed it . Quinn , look out behind you ! [ Zombie growling ] [ Screaming ] Quinn ! ( Wade ) It 's us . Relax , guys , it 's us . Good God , Quinn . Quinn , you 're not giving up . Need your blood . If you 've got a natural immunity to the bacteria , he needs your blood for an antidote . Well , your friend got in here and took the keys . And he 's gonna get worse , and he 's gonna come back for us . Sure , he even planned the whole thing . He took my keys so he could undo my deadbolts . As long as he doesn 't lead them all back here , we 'll be all right . You sure you can bring yourself to shoot him ? I 've shot people I liked a whole lot more than him . He is your friend , right ? He can 't talk because of his tongue . The research says it swells . Here . This always makes me feel better . I don 't think so . It 's Quinn 's decision . ( Wade ) What is it ? Caffeine tabs . Caffeine ? That 's it ? Yeah . I mixed some cayenne into this batch . My customers love pepper . Caffeine is illegal here ? Of course it 's illegal . The big drug manufacturers brainwash you . Truth is , they knew caffeine was safer than Lipron all along , but anything that 's natural and affordable , they outlawed . But caffeine 's not a weight-loss product . Yeah , not anymore . There 's a doctor back at the hospital . Okay , look , I 'm going with you . You can 't go alone . You go with him , you 'll only draw more attention . He can move better and faster without you . I 'll turn off the front lights . Look , we ... we 'll meet you in the morning for the slide , okay ? He 's gonna make it . I know it . I wanna believe that . [ Generator running ] It 's good as new . I gave Wade some chamomile tea . She 's resting . Losing your friend must have been hard on all of you . The Professor ? Yeah , well , time heals . It 's just gonna take a long time . Look , that 's a big hike back to the hospital , right ? Yeah , it shouldn 't take more than a couple of hours if he doesn 't run into trouble . That 's a big " if . " Maggie . [ Gun cocking ] It 's time , Quinn . Debra . Hold it . Don 't shoot . That 's the woman you were telling me about . You went to get her blood ? Get the antidote ! ( Dr. Tassler ) No , don 't shoot him ! Get him off me ! Get him off me ! [ Groaning ] ( Maggie ) Get the antidote ! Hurry , Doctor . Getting very close here . ( Quinn ) Could I please have some water ? Thank you . Let me see your eyes . They 're clear . How you feelin ' ? I 'm all right . Good . Because I made you a promise , and I always keep my word . All right , take it easy . I was able to use the centrifuge to isolate Debra 's antibody compound . Did you already inject me with it ? No . I 'm just finishing . You 're probably feeling the effects of the manufacturer 's antidote we gave you . But this is the cure . All right . Give me some caffeine capsules , and take some for yourself . It really helped me last night . Hey , just relax . ( Quinn ) I can 't . We gotta be leaving soon . We have a little over an hour . Wade and Remmy have to be on their way here by now . [ Grunts ] Not as much fun as shooting you . You might need the chair . You all right , Beckett ? Lt ... it just hit me . After my husband 's accident , he told me over and over that he ... he wanted to die . He ... he asked me if I 'd help him . I 'm sorry . It 's a horrible thing to ask of someone . You had to . He didn 't . I always thought Steve was strong . Everybody has their weak moments , whether they show them or not . I hate that feeling . We really have to get out there . [ Zombie growling ] At first , I thought they deserved what they got , for being so ignorant . But then I saw innocent children . Surviving is its own kind of horror . ( Debra ) You two go ahead . I 'll make sure it 's clear . Hey , I 'm sure the Professor wouldn 't want you to feel that way about it . No , but he 'd understand . Hey , Q-Ball ! ( Wade ) Quinn ! ( Rembrandt ) Maggie ! Maggie ! I hear them . They 're coming . ( Rembrandt ) Hey , Q-Ball ! Hey , Q-Ball ! ( Wade ) Quinn ? You 're cured ? Yeah . Maggie , you really came through . I was gonna shoot him . Last resort , but my finger was on the trigger . You couldn 't have done it . In a heartbeat . Rembrandt . I 'm beginning to see what you mean about sliding . Things get real thick in your head real fast . You just let it air out once in a while , and you 're gonna be fine . Not easy on the fly . Where 's this woman Debra you were tellin ' me about ? Where 'd she go ? She was right with us . ( Debra ) No ! No , please , somebody help me ! ( Debra ) Wade ! Maggie ! We 've gotta go after her . ( Debra ) I 'm down here ! Please ! Jacket . ( Quinn ) Give me the gun . No ! Somebody ! [ Zombies growling ] Help me ! ( Debra ) Oh , my God , help ! Please ! No ! Please somebody help me ! We 've gotta go after her . Recognize and concede . One is an acceptable loss here . [ Gun cocking ] Not to me . Well , then give me the timer . No way . That way . [ Gun cocking ] [ Debra grunting ] [ Zombie growling ] [ Zombie groaning ] ( Quinn ) Clear shot ! [ Growling ] [ Zombie screaming ] [ Zombie groaning ] Getting soft ? ( Wade ) Come on . I 'd rather be eaten than stay down here . How much time is left ? ( Rembrandt ) We got less than 10 minutes . God , it stinks in here . [ Quinn coughing ] [ Rembrandt coughing ] Your eyes , they 're ... they 're normal . You 're gonna need shots . Lots of them . Quinn , maybe we shouldn 't slide . We can 't carry this thing to another world . Quinn already spoke to the doctor . He 's sure this is the answer . You showed me something down there , Wade . You really did . ( Rembrandt ) Is he coming with us ? Is she ? But we didn 't tell her anything about it . You really can go to parallel worlds ? Just like we told you . We have to leave . Debra , this is Dr. Tassler . He developed a cure using your blood . [ Whooshing ] You could come with us . But then ... It would be the end of mankind here . Well , you 're asking if I wanna leave this world with you ? That 's right . You can come with us . I never trusted doctors . You can trust me , Debra . We 're the only hope this world has . Look , it 'll take time , but we can start to inoculate people . We can create a groundswell of recovery . That 's what it 's all about , isn 't it ? A lot of things just come down to loyalty . Don 't they ? [ Whooshing ]

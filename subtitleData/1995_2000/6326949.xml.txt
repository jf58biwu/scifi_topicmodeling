I 've never seen such a thing . The film was exposed directly through roller . - How was it possible ? - I think the X-ray radiation or kind . The email Allana mention something about a mine . Uranium or plutonium . I do not believe . The whole reel was exposed suddenly , as if by lightning . That would explain the burns ? Maybe , but it will help you realize what is on those pictures . Wait ... - What are you doing ? - It should be a single image , no ? Ie all the roll was exposed at once . Thus , each frame should be a piece of the picture .

Allana seeking in the desert ? What a find , Jim ? What is happening here is wrong . He could warn people about it , just as I try . You sent emails ... You 're the one who contacted Raven Nation . I think so . Then we do not need it . Allana thinks he has something . - Was the fields of observation . - What fields ? Fields residue . I threw the old mine tailings . Fields of stone ... It 's quatrain . What happens there ? What happens on the fields of observation ? I think form a kind of army . You know , be prepared . This is why ... What am I doing here , Jim ? What do you notice ? Is there anything in that mine ? Nu ... In his ... You 're ready ? Go ! Allana , and now Jim . Why do people ãºtia , this ? Jim tried to tell us . Do you think he was right ? Dial an army here ? Quatrain mentions , " avant-garde " and " evil " . Vanguard must be for him , Mabus . - Foster , I 'm looking for a few hours . - Sorry , I had to make a detour . Where 're ? The police frequencies are talking only about yourself . Do not get your worry , we come to you . You know those pictures monster ? I know what it is . - You know what killed Allana ? - Yes , give me a Jordan . - He was her friend . - Wait , Eddie , give logged in . - Eddie , what is it ? - You know that movie is run in a cutiuþã ? If you consider the film curvature and distortion caused by the size ... Eddie , please , what was ? It 's not a monster , he 's a man in a suit radioactive . The photo was a man in suit radioactive . Yes , but the thing is that I contacted the National Geological Survey , There is no radioactive deposit around . It 's not mine , Eddie . It was closed in ' 88 . What are the costumes ? There must be something in the ground . I got a hint from him that sent mail , said " more than " no " in . " Over ? You wonder what it means ? I 'm afraid I can not answer other questions . For such a orãºel have a very high rate of mortality . Jim mentioned fields of debris . I 'll get some maps to check . You see fields and Eddie , I am going to the city . - How are excavating ? - May collect . - I 'm almost ready . - I 'll be glad when it 's over . - When and where ? - It is difficult for all , Burke . Do not start . - Hello , Sheryl . - Sheryl ... - You bastard ! - Sheryl ... I saw Jim in the morgue . Shot ! So it is . I brought her body . - He was your friend ! - Get your hands off me ! Sheryl was probably Cade Foster . We know that is a killer . With puºcã ? A bag with înfãºuratã have razor . - Yes , so the doctor said . - Sheryl , listen ... I 'm tired of listening ! - You killed Jim ! - Had ! No one else had the courage to do it , and my job is to protect Hope and secrecy . You can not blame me because I do my job . I thought that save this city . Maybe not worth saving . I have to solve this . Charlie , talk about Sheryl . Tell me , Burke , how else to stay alive . Tell me ! - Going somewhere ? - I 'm going to take my children . - We have to talk . - Later on . Now I need to leave . You wanted to believe that Allan died in a car accident . Friends found , case closed , leave the city . - But I saw it , Sheryl . - Do not know about you talk . - You know how you look ? - Let me go , please . The skin on his face was burned . As if it were scalding . - I do not want to hear . - Sin . Allana was my friend . It was intelligent , brave And he died to save people just like you . - What do you want from me ? - I want to know who killed her . I promise that I will not stop until I find out . I killed her . Your ? I and everyone in this city . Walk a few hours . Foster , what are we doing here ? I will be as a blood bank for the local population þânþari . Jim a tractat maºina Allanei de pe Route 89 . That 's the fastest way there until speaking Jim fields . This aºtepþi sã gãseºti you ? If we 're lucky , the same thing that was Allana . - A tape recorder . - What are you doing here ? Jordan , I think I found something great . I have to face the evidence that the second wave is here . O Lord , I 'm coming . Maybe we should consider it a warning . God , Foster , are meteoriþi . Spheres . Recolteazã spheres . That is , Eddie , the vanguard of the second wave . The city that 's studded alien conscience . Gua Central Station . Contaminated streams flowing in stone fields ... Feeds meteors , man . Raining spheres . Why not detect our radar ? - Sunspots . - Yes , I read about outages NORAD radar temporary , surveillance of North America . They are caused by flicker of sunspots , solar flares are . What 's with those costumes radioactive , but with burns on his face Allan ? Maybe too close . Meteoriþii can be highly radioactive . Gua must be synchronized them to enter the atmosphere during flicker . And the city collects spheres , forming an army for Mabus . As if fighting extratereºtrilor would be quite difficult . That 's why I trust friends , Foster . Mankind always dezamãgeºte me . How C-4 of the caravan , Eddie ? Enough to send back to where they came spheres and even something more . First find them , I think they know where to look . - What is this ? What do ? - Sit down ! We have some questions , but I warn you that we have too much patience . Do înþelegem . - Who runs this office ? - I. - Horace Burke ? - Aºa e . Hope City Council , have something to do and with this ? I 'm the president and I will have a sitting council immediately . It 's quite important here . It 's good . Can you tell us where are stored spheres . I have no idea what you speak . ªtim de SFERE , meteori , Cave . You can not nervous about extratereºtrii . What do you do with the spheres ? Store them in an old mine until the next shipment . - And when will that be ? - Tomorrow . Ridicã-te ! Miºcã ! We must go to the Council meeting . We were told that if we were working at Gua , If you keep quiet and collaborators , they keep us alive . And if not ? They will cut throats of our children . - Why did the authorities have announced ? - Who would believe ? And where we know that would be found ? - It would have been at stake the lives of our children . - So that you remain silent . Our silence has become like a cancer . Jim was killed , because he could not bear . Who made it ? Cobb ? So I think . I think he also logged murdered girlfriend . Charlie Cobb know him . Not a bad man . Working in a charitable organization , he was the baseball coach . I do not understand how this could happen . I am telling you how . If you do pact with the devil you 're lost . Sorry , Jordan . I 'm sorry for your friend . Ladies and gentlemen , are Cade Foster . Wanted for murder . Contrary to what people think are innocent . The same group for which you work , I staged crimes . The Council is still sitting , friends . I know what happens here . I know . They came , you were threatened . Now you work for an alien power , Gua . Ajutaþi them and bring an army . - I had no choice . - Always a choice . If things look so ... our choice was to live . I 'm talking about how trãiþi . And you really think you can stop them with your husband ? It 's not my husband . Work together . So leave it . And yes , we 'll stop . - Hands up . Turn yourself . - Charlie , what are you doing ? - No raise money for charity . - Shut up ! I knew you wanted to go , Sheryl . But I thought you traitors have your community . You 're traitors Cobb . Even more 're and criminal . Hands on your head . Council will handle this . ... Want slavery or freedom ? It is worth lupþi for some things . Even die for them . I know that you are afraid , but there must be a way . - A chance to recuperaþi your lives ! - Inside , go on ! Behind . Stai jos , Sheryl . Pune arma jos , Foster . Put it on the floor . I mastered the situation ! On the floor . Do it or I 'll kill . Push it here . Who you think ? Arrivals here tell us , to do with our families . Cobb 's right . You do not have any idea what I went through . Not true ! - Gua took them all to Foster . - Then he has nothing to lose . What are you shot it ? Or your boyfriend ? Do not get so excited . How do you feel , Foster saw them with a gun ? That 's what we live every day . They were threatened families and children . What else could we do ? Take action . Struggling against them ! You can not trust Gua . Sooner or later they will come to you . Want to Survive Your sons , but they will inherit a world controlled by extratereºtri . And if this happens , I 've translated . - What you take as you understand that ? - You 'll never know . If you are only fighting for this town , then so be . - Put the gun down , Cobb . - What are you doing , Burke ? - Seriously , Cobb . Forget it . - I cant do this ! Enough . Turns out ! - Kill , Burke . Finish it . - We will discuss in the Council . - How do we do here . - We no longer do . Foster ! He was my friend . Ai SÃ împuºti MÃ ? And Eddie ... Jordan ... Sheryl ? We kill each other . That is exactly what he wants Gua . Continue to do this . Unless we quit ... now . Everything is in order . Everything is there . - Next week . - I do not think so . I changed the conditions slightly . - We set conditions . - Enough of this . Understanding its end . Do not have your worries . We leave you alive to them transmiþi a message to Mabus . Tell him that he lost hope . Aºadar Rama ? It would be able to return . - If they do , we 'll be ready . - This is again our city . - Thanks to the Thiele and your friends . - It may be hard . Maybe you will have you struggling to keep it . What we need to do long ago . - Success . - Thank you . Goodbye ! What are we doing now ? Browse other areas that were out-of NORAD ? Close all places of restoration , stop the influx Gua on this planet . I still believe that he must give spheres authorities . Yes , to be sure we Gua infiltraþi in government . I just destroyed an army . That 's enough for now . Allan got to call family to tell them what happened , but first , let 's see Help save them . When extratereºtrii destroyed my life , I knew that we must fight with them . I do not think I had a choice , but the people of Hope , who believe that they have no choice when Gua have threatened lives and families ? They can be sentenced innocent people are taught a terrible enemy ? Evil must be opposed once-and raises hideous head . You risk the life of a whole city to oppose resistance ? When I look at Eddie and Jordan , my new family I know how hard it would be the choice . Translation and adaptation Florin ( c ) thin

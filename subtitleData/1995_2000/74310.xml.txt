 We 've become bored with watching actors Give us phony emotions . We 're tired of pyrotechnics and special effects . While the world he inhabits ... is , in some respects , counterfeit , There 's nothing fake about Truman himself- - No scripts , no cue cards . It isn 't always Shakespeare , but it 's genuine . It 's a life . I 'm not going to make it . You 're going to have to go on without me . No way , mister . You 're going to the top of this mountain , broken legs and all . We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort . You 're crazy , you know that ? Well , for me , there is no difference between a private life and a public life . My life ... is my life , is the Truman show . The Truman show is ... a lifestyle . It 's a noble life . It is ... a truly blessed life . Yeah , tell me something I don 't know . All right . Promise me one thing , though . If I die before I reach the summit , you 'll use me as an alternative source of food . Ew . Gross . It 's all true . It 's all real . Nothing here is fake . Nothing you see on this show is fake . It 's merely controlled . Eat me , damn it . That 's an order . Maybe just your love handles . I have love handles ? Yeah . Little ones . Truman ! You 're going to be late . Ok ! Good morning . Morning . Morning . Oh , and in case I don 't see you , good afternoon , good evening , and good night . Yep , yep . Morning . Morning , Spencer . Hey , Pluto . No , no , no . Get down . He won 't hurt you . Get down . Ha ha . I know . It 's just me . Come on , Pluto . Ohh ! Holy cow . What is it ? Here 's a news flash just in . An aircraft in trouble began shedding parts as it flew over Seahaven just a few moments ago . I know . Wow . Luckily , no one was hurt . But , hey , how do you feel today ? Mmm , mmm . Heh heh . That 's good . You thinking of flying somewhere ? Nope . No ? Good . This is classical clive with classical drive , so why don 't you forget about the perils of flying , settle back , and let this music calm you down ? Dog fancy , please . Dog fancy . Thank you very much . Ahh ! Give me a paper there , will you , earl ? Oh , and , uh ... One of these for the wife . Loves her fashion mags . Will that be all for you , Truman ? That 's the whole kit and caboodle . Catch you later . Ok . Yep . Good morning . Hey . Hank . Morning , Truman . Good morning , Truman . Hey , how are you , guys ? Beautiful day , isn 't it ? Oh . Always . Oh , and how 's your lovely wife ? Good , good . How about yours ? Oh , couldn 't be better . Fine , fine , fine . Um , nice talking to you , Truman . You , too . We must go now . Hey , think about that policy , huh ? Ok , that 's 2 for 1 . That 's a good deal . Doppelganger special . Right . Hey . Hi . Hey , fellas . You going in ? Go ahead . Hey . Go ahead . No , you first , please . I 'm not that anxious to get there . Ohh ... Yes , hello . Could I have directory assistance for Fiji , please ? Fiji Islands . Truman , did you see this ? Ha ! Uh , I 'm sorry , ma 'am . If--if he 's in a coma , he 's probably uninsurable . Hello ? Yes . Uh , Fiji , please . Do you have a listing for Lauren Garland ? Nothing listed ? Ok . Do you have a Sylvia Garland ? " S " for Sylvia . Nothing ? Ok . Thank you . Lawrence . Hey , Burbank . Got a prospect in wells park I need you to close . W-wells park ? On , uh ... Harbor Island ? You know another one ? Well , I can 't do it . I , uh , have an appointment . Dentist . Or ... Yeah . You 're going to lose a lot more than your teeth if you don 't meet your quota . Look , Truman ... They 're making cutbacks at the end of this month . Cutbacks ? Yeah . Now , you need this . Besides , a half hour across the bay , a little sea air ... would do you good . Hey , thanks . Hello . Ferry still here , huh ? Thought I might have missed it . One-way or return ? Return . There you go , sir . Heh heh . Uhh ... Do you need any help , sir ? You go ahead . I 'll--I 'll be fine . Heh . Yeah . Hi , honey . Look what I got free at the checkout . It 's a chef 's pal . It 's a dicer , grater , peeler--all in one . Never needs sharpening , dishwasher safe . Wow . That 's amazing . Truman ... you missed a spot . Oh , Jesus . Mmm . That is a beer . You know , I 'm thinking about getting out , Marlon . Yeah ? Out of what ? Out of my job , out of Seahaven . Off this island . Out . Out of your job ? What the hell 's wrong with your job ? You have a great job , Truman . You have a desk job . I 'd kill for a desk job . Here you go . You should try stocking vending machines for a living . No , thanks . Now , there 's excitement . Don 't you ever get antsy ? Itchy feet ? Where 's there to go ? Fiji . Where the hell 's Fiji ? Near Florida ? Hmm . See here ? Yeah . This is us ... And all the way around here ... Fiji . You can 't get any further away before you start coming back . You know , there are still islands in Fiji where no human being has ever set foot . Whoo . So , when are you going to go ? It 's not that simple . It takes ... money , planning . I can 't just up and go . Right . I 'm going to do it . Don 't worry about that . Bonus time is just around the corner . Hmm . Hey , you coming for a drink ? No . I can 't tonight . I don 't like the look of that weather , son . I think we should head back . Oh , no , dad . Not yet . No , come on . We should go back . A bit farther . Listen- - Please ? Ok . Yes . Daddy ! Ohh ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Oh You 're soaked . Where have you been ? I figure if we can scrape together 8,000- - every time you and Marlon get together- - we can bum around the world for a year on that . And then what , Truman ? We 'd be where we were 5 years ago . You 're talking like a teenager . Well , maybe I feel like a teenager . We have mortgage payments , Truman . We have car payments . What , we 're just going to walk away from our financial obligations ? It would be an adventure . I thought we were going to try for a baby . Isn 't that enough of an adventure ? That can wait . I want to get away- - see some of the world , explore . Honey , you want to be an explorer ? This 'll pass . We all think like this now and then . Let 's get you out of these wet clothes , hmm ? Come to bed . You never see anything anyway . They always ... turn the camera and play music and ... you know , the wind blows in , and the curtains move , and you don 't see anything . Dog fancy , please . Dog fancy . Thank you . Paper , earl , please . Paper . Oh ... I might as well pick one of these up . For the wife ? She 's got to have them . Anything else , Truman ? That 's the whole ball of wax . Catch you later . Ok . Dad ? Ohh ! Hey , what are you doing ? Hey ! What the- - Get out of the way ! Stop them ! Ohh ! Stop those people ! Stop ! Stop ! Hey ! Open the doors ! Somebody stop the bus ! Stop the bus ! Somebody stop it ! Somebody stop the bus ! Stop the bus ! Aah ! It doesn 't sound insane at all , Truman . I see him 10 times a week In a hundred different faces . I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday . It was dad . I swear . Dressed like a homeless man . And you know what else was strange ? A businessman and a woman with a little dog came out of nowhere and forced him onto a bus . Well , it 's about time they cleaned up the trash downtown before we become just like the rest of the country . They never found dad 's body . Maybe somehow- - oh , god . I 'm telling you , if it wasn 't him , it was his twin . Did dad have a brother ? Truman , you know perfectly well that your father was an only child , just like you . Now , sweetie ... You 're just feeling bad because of what happened- - you sailing off into that storm . But I 've never blamed you , Truman ... and I don 't blame you now . Truman ? What are you doing down here ? Fixing the mower . Saw my father today . I know . Your mother called . You really shouldn 't upset her like that . Did you want- - what did you want ? I made macaroni . I 'm not hungry . You know ... You really ought to throw out that mower . Get one of those new elk rotaries . What 's he doing ? See , they got rid of her , but they couldn 't erase the memory . The memory of who ? Shh . Hey , hey . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . Oh ! Ow ! Whoa . Ow ! Excuse me . Hi . Hi . I 'm so sorry I fell on you like that . It 's ok . I 'm just--I 've been such a klutz all day . It 's all right . Sprained this ankle . Oh , my goodness . Oh , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry to fall on you like that . Oh , that 's all right . Don 't worry about it . I 'm Meryl . Hi . I 'm Truman . Hey . Nice to meet you . Whoo !

No . I got to commit this to memory . Come on , Truman , one ice-cold Brewski . Come on . Come on . You 're going to have to copy off me , so be careful . I know it . No ? You 're a better person than I am . See you later . Ok . Bye . Bye . See you later , loser . Ow ! Shh ! Hi . Konnichi-wa . What ? Oh . You take Japanese . Oh , yes . Yeah . Lauren , right ? It 's on the ... Lauren . Right , right . I 'm Truman Burbank . Yeah ... I--I know . you know , I 'm not allowed to talk to you . Really ? Yeah . Well , I can understand that . I 'm a pretty dangerous character . I 'm sorry . It 's not up to me . A girl 's got to be careful . You have a boyfriend , right ? No , it 's not that . Was it Meryl , that girl that was with me ? We 're not--we don 't- - we 're not--we 're just- - we 're friends . It 's nothing like that . It 's how I look ? Not your type ? No . I like your pin . I was wondering that myself . Mmm . Would you want to ... Maybe possibly ... Sometime go out for some pizza or something ? Like , Friday ? Saturday ? I can 't . Sunday , Monday , Tuesday ? We have finals tomorrow . Yeah , I know . If we don 't go now , it won 't happen . Do you understand ? So , what do you want to do ? Whoo-hoo ! Please keep your hands inside the car ! This is my favorite pizza place . Tony ! One large , extra plankton . We have so little time . They 're going to be here any minute . Who are ? They don 't want me talking to you . Then don 't talk . They 're here . Truman . What do they want ? Listen to me . Everybody knows about you . Everybody knows everything you do . They 're pretending , Truman . Do you understand ? Everybody 's pretending . Lauren , I don 't know- - No , my name 's not Lauren . It 's Sylvia . My name 's Sylvia . Sylvia ? Yeah . Lauren , sweetheart , not again . Hey , wait a minute . Who are you ? I 'm her father ! What ? I 've never even seen him before . Honey , please . He 's lying . Truman , please , don 't listen to him . Everything I 've told you is the truth . This , it 's fake . It 's all for you . I don 't understand . The sky and the sea , everything--it 's a set . It 's a show . Everybody 's watching you . Please don 't listen to him . He 's gonna lie to you . They 're watching us now . What 's going on ? Schizophrenia . She has episodes . Please . Oh , no ! We 've tried everything . Hypnotism , shock therapy . Don 't worry . You 're not the first . Truman ! She brings all her boyfriends down here . What 's he saying ? Truman , he 's lying ! Get out of here . Come and find me . Don 't worry . We 're going to Fiji . Fiji . We 're moving to Fiji . Fiji ? Sylvia ! Hey ! Why didn 't he just follow her to Fiji ? His mother got sick , really sick . He couldn 't leave her . He 's kind . Maybe he 's too kind . I can 't believe he married Meryl on the rebound . Excuse me . Come on , Sal . We 've already got this on the greatest hits tape . Can I borrow that ? Close , but no cigar . And it 's another beautiful day in paradise , folks , but don 't forget to buckle up out there in radio land . Remem- - good driver--good--good--good . Good--good--good- - good--good . Driver--good--driver--good . Good--good--good . Wait for the cue . Wait for the cue . Stand by , one . Countdown to action . Stand by , one . He 's heading west on Stewart . Stand by , all extras . He 'll be on you in about 90 seconds . Props , make sure the coffee 's hot . Ok , he 's making his turn onto Lancaster square . Aah ! Oh , my god . He nearly hit her . Something 's wrong . Change frequencies . Ouch . Sorry about that , folks . I guess we picked up a police frequency or something . It sometimes happens , and it can drive you crazy . Ok , it 's classical clive back in here , and we 've still got some great music up ahead , but hey , don 't forget to buckle up . Remember safety . A good driver is a safe driver . A safe driver is what ? Yes . Morning , ma 'am . I love that idea . It 's pretty cool , isn 't it ? Yeah , I love it . Can I help ? Yeah . I have an appointment at Gable Enterprises . That 's impossible . What 's happening ? Nothing . Just tell me what 's happening . Got to go , sir . We 're remodeling . No , you 're not . What are those people doing back there ? It 's none of your business . If you don 't tell me what 's happening , I 'll report you ! You 're trespassing . Right . Marlon ! Truman . What are you doing here ? I gotta talk to you . It 's a bad time , ok ? I 'm way behind . I 'm onto something , Marlon . Something big . You ok ? You look like shit . I think I 'm mixed up in something . Mixed up in what ? There 's no point trying to explain it , but a lot of strange things have been happening . The people on the elevator . There was no backing on it . I looked out . There was people there . And on the radio on the way to work , it starts following me along , talking about everything that I 'm doing . You know what I mean ? Truman , look , this is one of your fantasies . I think this is about my dad . Your dad ? I think he 's alive . Yeah . I 'll tell you about it later . I 'm definitely being followed . Who ? It 's hard to tell . They look just like regular people . How about those two ? I don 't know . Could be . It 's when I 'm unpredictable , that 's--they can 't ... Did anything happen ? No . Mm-hmm . We gotta get out of here . You ready to go ? No . I just came here . Come on . I told you I can 't . You 're gonna get both our asses fired . You know that . Ok , man , let 's do it . What ? Whatever you say . I 'm game . What are you talking about ? Yes , siree . Your birthday comes but once a year . Maybe I 'm being set up for something . You ever think about that , Marlon ? Like your whole life Has been building towards something ? Mmm , no . When you were hauling chickens in the summer for Kaiser , what was the furthest you ever got off the island ? Went all over . Never found a place like this , though . Look at that sunset , Truman . It 's perfect . Yeah . That 's the big guy . Quite a paintbrush he 's got . Yup . Just between you and me , Marlon ... I 'm going away for a while . Really ? Yeah . Oh , little angel . Oh , my little clown . Old carrot top . The best photos . Ohh . Ohh . We should be getting you home , mother . Hold on a minute . Here 's us at Mount Rushmore . Do you remember , Truman , when dad was still with us ? That was quite a drive . You slept the whole way there . It looks so small . Things always do when you look back , darling . Oh , look , Truman . The happiest day of our lives . Oh , look . Jean , Jodie , Joanne . Doesn 't she look beautiful , Truman ? Well , she still does . And there 's lots of pages left over for baby photos . I would like to hold a grandchild in my arms before I go . Angela , we really should be getting you home . I 'll take her . No , no , no . You stay , relax . Enjoy yourself . Your favorite show will be coming on . Besides , we have something to discuss . A certain person 's birthday . Oh , I see . And there 'll be another episode of I love Lucy same time tomorrow . But right now it 's time for golden oldies . Tonight , we present the enduring , much-loved classic show me the way to go home . A hymn of praise to small-town life , where we learn that you don 't have to leave home to discover what the world 's all about , and that no one is poor who has friends . Full of laughter and love , pain and sadness , but ultimately redemption , we share the trials and tribulations of the Abbott family . Note the touching performance of Ronald Brierly as uncle buddy . and that scene with the bowl of cherries is gonna have you splitting your sides with laughter all over again . And there 'll be tears , too , when David and Jennifer are reunited . But enough from me . Let 's join the Abbotts in Camden Village . Oh . Thank you , sweetie . I need to talk to you , but let 's go outside . Oh , sweetie , I 'd love to , but I 'm really late . What 's your rush ? Surgery . There was that elevator disaster downtown . It was on the news last night . This cable just snapped . This elevator , it just plummeted down 10 flights . The non-union workers . Just monsters . You know , that building , it 's right next door to where you work . Can you imagine if you had been in there ? It 's not even worth thinking about . Anyway , I have an amputation on one of the young women in that elevator . She 's very young . It 's very sad . Anyway , wish me luck . I 'll cross my fingers for you . Uh , excuse me . Hi . Excuse me . May I help you ? Oh , uh ... Yes . I 'm looking for my wife , nurse Burbank . It 's very important . I 'm afraid that that 's not possible . She 's in pre-op . Sure . Ok , fine . Can you pass along a message ? I 'll try . Can you tell her I had to go to Fiji and that I 'll call her when I get there ? When you- - when you get to Fiji ? You got it . Fine . I 'll tell her . Thank you so much . Sorry . It 's ok . He 's here . I know , I know . Shh , shh , shh . Scalpel . Ahem . I 'm now making my primary incision just above the right knee . Nicely done . This isn 't going to be pretty . It 's just beautiful . Beautiful job . I 'll just let someone else tidy up here . I 'm sorry to keep you . Oh , that 's ok . How can I help ? I would like to book a flight to Fiji . When would you like to leave ? Today . I 'm sorry . I don 't have anything for at least a month . A month ? It 's the busy season . You want to book the flight ? It doesn 't matter . I 'll make other arrangements , ok ? Last call for Chicago ! All aboard ! Thank you . Windy city , here we come . Hi . Hi . Hello . Hi . Sisters . Hey , mom , isn 't that- - Shh . Face the front . Everybody off . We 've got a problem . I 'm sorry , son . His father was from Chicago , wasn 't he ? No . His dentist was from Pensacola . His father was from Des Moines . But how come he wants to go to Chicago ? He 's not going to Chicago . He 's not going anywhere . He has to have it out with Meryl . Truman ? Honey , are you ok ? Get in . Truman . Look . What ? Shh . I predict that in just a moment we will see a lady on a red bike , followed by a man with flowers and a Volkswagen beetle with a dented fender . Truman , please . Look . Lady ... flowers ... and ... Truman , this is silly . There it is ! There it is ! There 's that dented Beetle ! Yes ! Aaaaaah ! Ha ha ha ! Don 't you want to know how I did that ? I 'll tell you . They 're on a loop . They go around the block . They come back . They go around again . They just go round and round . Round and round . I invited Rita and Marlon for a barbecue on Sunday . I won 't be here Sunday . And I need you to remind me that we need more charcoal . Are you listening to a word I 'm saying ? You 're upset because you want to go to Fiji . Is that it ? Ok , ok , go . I think you should save for a few months and then go . There . Are you happy now ? I want to go take a shower . Let 's go now . I 'm ready to go now . Why wait ? Early bird gathers no moss . Rolling stone catches the worm , right ? Truman , what are you doing ? Oh ! Truman ! Where shall we go ? Where shall we go ? Truman , where are we going ? I don 't really know . I guess I 'm being spontaneous . Somebody help me ! I 'm being spontaneous ! Truman . Forget Fiji . Can 't very well drive to Fiji , can we ? No . What about Atlantic City ? Oh , no , you hate to gamble . That 's right , I do , don 't I ? So why would you want to go there ? Because I never have . That 's why people go places , isn 't it ? Truman , Truman , I think I 'm gonna throw up . Me , too . Blocked at every turn . Beautifully synchronized , don 't you agree ? You 're blaming me for the traffic ? Should I ? Truman ... Let 's go home . You 're right . We could be stuck here for hours . It could be like this all the way to Atlantic City . Let 's go back . I 'm sorry . I don 't know what got into me . Can you please slow down ? Yes , I can . Truman ! Truman ! That 's our turnoff ! I changed my mind again . What 's New Orleans like this time of year ? Mardi gras ! Whoo ! Ha ha ha ! Whoo ! Look , Meryl , same road , no cars . It 's magic . Ha ha ha ! You let me out . You 're not right in the head . You want to destroy yourself , do it on your own . I think I 'd like a little company . Oh , Truman ... You knew this would happen . You know you can 't drive over water . Let 's go home where you 'll feel safe . Give me your hand . Sweetie- - Drive . Truman ! We shouldn 't be doing this ! We 're breaking the law ! Oh , my ! You can do it ! Please , don 't ! You can make it ! Truman ! Aah ! Oh , we 're over ! We 're over the bridge ! We 're over the bridge ! We 're over ? We 're over the bridge . We 're over the bridge . We 're over ! Ha ha ha ha ! Truman ! What about that sign ? They 're exaggerating . We 'll be fine . Exaggerating ? Do you believe that ? Oh , my ! Oh , my ! Truman , we 're on fire ! It 's ok . We 're on fire ! It 's ok . It 's just smoke . You ok ? Yes . Want to do it again ? No ! Ha ha ha ha ! Truman , stop ! Oh , god ! Oh ! So , what are we going to do for money when we get to New Orleans ? I have my Seahaven bank card . We 're just going to eat into our savings , is that it ? I 'm going to have to call your mother when we get there . She 's going to be worried sick . I don 't know how she 's going to take this . What now ? Red alert ! This is a red alert ! Truman , it looks like a leak at the plant . Back up ! Back up ! Leak at the plant . We had to shut her down . Is there any way around ? Whole area 's being evacuated . Is there anything I can do ? No , ma 'am . Thank you for your help . You 're welcome , Truman . Truman . Truman ! Truman ! Truman , come back ! Truman ! Truman ! Stop him ! Unh ! Truman ! Head to the left ! Aah ! Aah ! Stay away ! Unh ! Aah ! Unh ! No ! No ! ... now in custody . Thank you both so much for your help . I really appreciate it . He 's lucky to be alive , ma 'am . Next time , we 'll have to file charges . I understand . Thanks again . Good night . Let me get you some help , Truman . You 're not well . Why do you want to have a baby with me ? You can 't stand me . That 's not true . Why don 't you let me fix you some of this new mococoa drink ? All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes Of mount Nicaragua . No artificial sweeteners . What the hell are you talking about ? Who are you talking to ? I 've tasted other cocoas . This is the best . What the hell does this have to do with anything ? Tell me what 's happening ! You 're having a nervous breakdown , that 's what . You 're part of this , aren 't you ? Truman ! Meryl ! You ... are ... scaring me ! No , you 're scaring me , Meryl . What are you going to do ? Dice me ? Slice me and peel me ? There are so many choices ! Aah ! Do something ! What ? What did you say ? Who are you talking to ? Nothing . I didn 't say anything . I didn 't say anything . You said , " do something . " No , I didn 't . I wasn 't talking to anybody . Talk to me ! I don 't know anything ! Please stop ! Stay where you are ! Truman ? Truman ? Oh , thank god ! Oh , thank god ! How can anyone expect me to carry on under these conditions ? It 's unprofessional ! Shh , it 's ok . Everything 's gonna be ok . Oh , god ! It 's all gonna be fine . I don 't know what to think , Marlon . Maybe I 'm losing my mind , but ... it feels like the whole world revolves around me somehow . That 's a lot of world for one man , Truman . Sure that 's not wishful thinking ? You wishing you 'd made Something more out of yourself ? Come on , who hasn 't sat in the John , Had an imaginary interview on Seahaven tonight ? Who hasn 't wanted to be somebody ? This is different . Everybody seems to be in on it . I 've been your best friend since we were 7 years old . The only way you and I ever made it through school was by cheating off each other 's test papers . Jesus , they were identical . But I always felt safe knowing that . 'Cause whatever the answer was , we were right together and we were wrong together . Remember when I stayed up all night in your tent 'cause you wanted to play north pole ? And I got pneumonia ? You remember that ? You were out of school for about a month . You 're the closest thing I ever had to a brother . I know that things ... haven 't really worked out for either of us like we used to dream they would . I know that feeling , when it 's like everything 's slipping away ... You don 't want to believe it , So you look for answers somewhere else , but ... Well ... But , well , the point is ... I 'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you . Well ... The point is , I would gladly step in front of traffic for you , Truman . And the last thing I 'd ever do is lie to you . And the last thing that I would ever do ... is lie to you . I mean , think about it , Truman . If everybody is in on it ... I 'd have to be in on it , too . I 'm not in on it , Truman , because ... there is no " it . " You were right about one thing , though . What 's that ? The thing that started all this . Yep . I found him for you , Truman . That 's why I came by tonight . I 'm sure he 's got quite a story to tell . Go to him . Easy on the fog . Stand by , crane cam . Crane cam . Button cam 3 . I never stopped believing . And wide , curb cam 8 . My son ! Oh ! Move in for a closeup ? No , no , no . Move back and ... Fade up music . And now go in close . All those years wasted . I 'll make it up to you , son . I swear . Dad . Yes ! Bravo . That was a really great experience . Congratulations . Ok , quiet down . Let 's concentrate . That was good work . Whoo ! Let 's get some champagne up here . Congratulations . Brilliant , Christof . Just brilliant . It just broke my heart . Well done , everyone ! Bravo ! 1.7 billion were there for his birth . 220 countries tuned in for his first step . The world stood still for that stolen kiss , and as he grew , so did the technology . An entire human life recorded on an intricate network of hidden cameras and broadcast live and unedited 24 hours a day , 7 days a week to an audience around the globe . Coming to you now from Seahaven Island , enclosed in the largest studio ever constructed , and along with the great wall of china , one of only 2 manmade structures visible from space , now in its 30th great year , it 's ... What a week it 's been . I don 't know about you- - I was on pins and needles the entire time . Hello and good evening . I 'm your host Mike Michaelson , and welcome to tru-talk , our forum for issues growing out of the show . But tonight , something very special indeed , a rare and exclusive interview with the show 's conceiver and creator . So , come with us now as we go live to the lunar room on the 221st floor of the omni cam echosphere , where we 'll find the world 's greatest tele-visionary- - the designer and architect of the world within a world that is Seahaven Island- - Christof . Before we begin , I 'd like to thank you on behalf of our audience for granting this interview . We know how demanding your schedule is , and we all know how jealously you guard your privacy . This , sir , is indeed an honor . Don 't mention it . Well , the catalyst for the recent dramatic events on the show has been Truman 's father , Kirk , And his attempts to infiltrate the show . But before we get into that , I think it 's worth noting that this is not the first time someone from the outside has attempted to reach Truman , is it ? we have had close calls in the past . Truman ! It 's television ! Yes ! Yes ! I did it ! I 'm on the Truman show ! But there 's never been anything to compare with this most recent breach in security- - the first intruder to be a former cast member . A dead one at that . Gotta say , writing Kirk back in--masterstroke . Since Kirk started this crisis in Truman 's life , I came to the conclusion that only he could end it . Truman ! Truman ! No ! That 's off limits ! Why ? What 's over there ? Nothing . It 's dangerous . That 's all . You 've got to know your limitations , Truman . But let 's remind viewers exactly why dad was written out in the first place . As Truman grew up , we were forced to manufacture ways to keep him on the island . I 'd like to be an explorer , Like the great Magellan . You 're too late . There 's really nothing left to explore . finally , I came up with Kirk 's drowning . Most effective . Truman 's been terrified of the water ever since . when Kirk read the synopsis of the episode , he was disappointed to say the least . Jesus ! I 'm sure that 's what caused him to break onto the set . But how do you intend to explain his 22-year absence ? Amnesia . Brilliant . Let 's take some viewer phone calls . Charlotte , North Carolina , you 're on with Christof . Uh , yeah , hi , Christof . I was wondering how many cameras you got in that town . Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000 . That 's a lot of cameras . Remember , we started with just one . He was curious from birth . Premature by 2 weeks . Almost as if he couldn 't wait to get started . His eagerness to leave his mother 's womb was the very reason he was the one selected . In competition with 5 other unwanted pregnancies , the casting of a show , determined by an air date , Truman was the one who arrived on cue . Incidentally , I believe Truman is the first child to have been legally adopted by a corporation . That 's correct . The show has generated enormous revenues now , equivalent to the gross national product of a small country . People forget it takes the population of an entire country to keep the show running . Since the show is on 24-hours a day without commercial interruption , all those staggering revenues are generated by product placement . That 's true . Everything on the show is for sale . From the actor 's wardrobe , food products , to the very homes they live in . And all of it available in the Truman catalog . Operators are standing by . Christof , let me ask you , why do you think Truman has never come close to discovering the true nature of his world until now ? We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented . It 's as simple as that . The Hague for Christof . Hello ? The Hague ? All right , we 've lost that call . Let 's go to Hollywood . You 're on tru-talk . Hi , Christof . I 'd just like to say one thing . You 're a liar and a manipulator , and what you 've done to Truman is sick ! Well , we remember this voice , don 't we ? How could we forget ? Let 's go to another call . No , no , no . It 's fine , mike . I love to reminisce with former members of the cast . Sylvia ... as you announced so melodramatically to the world , you think because you batted your eyes at Truman once ... flirted with him ... stole a few minutes of air time with him ... to thrust yourself and your politics into the limelight ... that you know him ? That you know what 's right for him ? You really think you 're in a position to judge him ? What right do you have to take a baby and turn his life into some kind of mockery ? Don 't you ever feel guilty ? I have given Truman a chance to lead a normal life . The world ... the place you live in ... is the sick place . Seahaven 's the way the world should be . He 's not a performer . He 's a prisoner . Look at him ! Look at what you 've done to him ! He can leave at any time . If his was more than just a vague ambition , if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth , there 's no way we could prevent him . I think what distresses you really , caller , is that ultimately ... Truman prefers his cell , as you call it . That 's where you 're wrong . You 're so wrong , and he 'll prove you wrong . Well , aside from the heated comments of a very vocal minority , it 's been an overwhelmingly positive experience . Yes . For Truman and for the viewing public . Well , Christof , I can 't thank you enough for giving so generously of your time tonight . I think it 's safe to say now that this crisis is behind us and Truman is back to his old self , we can look forward to some exciting new developments ? Well , mike , the big news is that Meryl will be leaving Truman in an upcoming episode , and a new romantic interest will be introduced . Aha . I 'm determined television 's first on-air conception will still take place . Well , another television milestone straight ahead . You heard it here first . It has been a singular honor and pleasure , sir . Christof ... thank you . Thank you , mike . Hey , Simeon . What ? Is he looking at us ? Jesus , do you think he knows ? Hello ? Better call Christof . Hello ? Come in , major Burbank . Ha ha ! He 's back to his old self . Thank god . That 's an unusual cat , my man . I hereby ... Proclaim this planet ... Trumania of the Burbank galaxy . Is he going ? Hallway camera . That one 's for free . Keep up with him . He 'll move fast . Stand by , all house cameras . Morning ! Morning . In case I don 't see you ... good afternoon , good evening , And good night . Good afternoon ... Good morning . ... evening , and good night . Morning . Morning , Spencer . How 's it going ? Hmm , let me check . Vital signs are good . Whoa , Pluto ! Whoop ! Good morning , Truman ! Oh , look who 's here . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? Every single day . The policy- - we 've thought about it ... and we 're gonna take it . You 're kidding ? No ! Great ! Why don 't we go up to my office right now , And we 'll sign the papers ? Uh , next week would be much better . Next week would be better . All right . See you guys . Ok , bye now . See you next week . Give me something to look forward to . You got it . See , this isn 't about insurance . This is about the great variable- - when will death occur ? Could be a week , a month , a year . Could be today . Sunbather , minding his own business , stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella . No way to guard against that kind of thing . Uh , sorry , excuse me . Uh , Truman , this is Vivien . Vivien , this is Truman . The two of you are gonna be neighbors . Oh . I guess what I 'm- - What I 'm saying is that , uh , life is ... fragile . Vivien , your office . Sorry . What 's that ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Uh ... You do ? Oh , great . Uh , let me take your information . Ready 2 . Go to 2 . And back to medium . And wide . Psst ! I was just trying to train the kid to ... Never mind . what 's he doing in the basement ? He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left . Why wasn 't I told ? Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported . Uh , he--he 's just sleeping , I thought . This the best shot we 've got ? What 's to see ? What 's on the clock cam ? It 's an obstruction- - obstruction . What happened down there ? He was just tidying up his garbage . I was gonna call you , but halfway through , he gave up , and he fell asleep . I wanna check on the setups for the ... insurance convention tomorrow . Yes . Yeah . Nice move . There you go . Isolate the audio . Give me a closeup on his torso . He 's still breathing . Where 's Chloe ? Yes , sir . Call him . What do you want me to say ? Tell him it 's a wrong number . What took you so long ? Just had to wait for it . They were busy . Here . What 's going on ? I don 't know . They 're ... He came down into the room . He did nothing but stand around for a while . Shut up and watch it ! Then we went to nightvision . He 's asleep . there ! Stop it ! What ? Zoom in . On which ? Under the chair there . Uh-huh . enhance it . Is it--oh . Oh , my god . I ... if--he couldn 't have gone up the stairs . I definitely--he must still be in the room . Get Marlon over there . Right away . Truman ! Surprise party ! Oh . Come on , buddy . I got a 6-pack of cold Brewskis with our name on them . Come on , pal . Come on , buddy . Shit . Marlon , find him . He 's still in the room . Come out , come out wherever you are . That 's good . Keep it light . I know you 're in here . I 'm gonna find ya . Check under the table . The closet , behind you . Huh . Gee . I wonder where he could possibly be . The lawn cam , get me the lawn cam . Don 't look in the camera . Say something . Keep it going . Keep it going . He 's gone . Cut transmission ! Cut transmission ? Cut it ! Jesus ! God in heaven ! Everything 's black . Give me the phone . I don 't know where he is , but he 's gone . We 've got every available extra looking for him . Uh , the principals are helping out . The crew , too , so every sector 's covered . What about prop cars ? Yes , they 've been accounted for . He has to be on foot . He has the world 's most recognizable face . He can 't disappear . Go . Hunt him . Hunt him . Yeah . Go find him , Pluto . Good dog ! Good dog ! All this fuss . If he could just hear my voice . Truman ! Truman ! Let me try . Truman ! It 's me ! Dad ! Let 's talk ! Yeah , I know . Just about done with the square . Got to go back to Barrymore , check the interiors . He 's got to be in there . Barrymore , huh ? Uh-huh . But what about the college ? Who 's watching that ? I don 't know . Send somebody over there , ok ? All right . Take another man and get down there now , all right ? I don 't give a damn . Just find the son of a bitch . Get some batteries . This guy 's not gonna glow in the dark . Just get ' em down here . I don 't know what 's going on . Reroute it back to me . We need more light . We 'll never find him this way . What time is it ? It 's way too early for that . Cue the sun . Jeez ! What time is it ? Christof , what 's going on ? Did you know that there 's a rumor circulating that he 's dead ? You hear me ? The media is having a feeding frenzy over this . All the phone lines are jammed , and every network has a pirated shot of Marlon making an ass of himself in front of the camera . The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts . Why ? We 're getting higher ratings with this graphic than we 've ever had on this show . No sign of him . Why don 't you head back to town and join the others ? Everyone else is at first positions , ok ? Thank you . Everyone 's at first positions , right ? We 've got the light . So he 's got to be there somewhere . We 're not watching the sea . Hang on a minute . Why would we watch the sea ? Sweep the harbor . Bring up the harbor cameras . Shift all harbor cameras to computer , please . Some of those are out , aren 't they ? Yeah . We have 4 of them down , but we have the lighthouse cameras up . All buoy cams , please . What 's happening ? Ok . Long lens , short base cameras . Why are we looking at the water ? Pan it , will you , please ? Truman ... Where are you going ? How can he sail ? He 's in insurance . Isn 't he terrified of the water ? Resume transmission . Resuming transmission . I got 2 to 1 he doesn 't make it . Hey , I want a piece of that . 2 to 1 he doesn 't make it . Just leave ' em in the car . Shh . Let 's get off this mast shot . We can 't see his face . Go to the cabin cam . Cabin cam . There . Perfect . That 's our hero shot . Let 's get another boat out there . Ok . Listen , Gus , I need you to talk to the guys on the ferry . Come on . Get it moving . Get it out of here . Come on . I 'm just a bus driver . Bottom line is , they can 't drive the boat . They 're actors . How do we stop him ? Ok , uh ... We 're going to be accessing the weather program now . So hold on to your hats . You got that ? No . I think we 're gonna want to localize the storm over the boat . You can get the coordinates for that . There 's no rescue boat . He won 't know what to do . He 'll turn back . He 'll be too afraid . There she blows . Come on . Give me some lightning . Again ! Hit him again ! For god 's sake , Christof , the whole world is watching . We can 't let him die in front of a live audience . He was born in front of a live audience . Truman ! You can do it ! Hold on ! Is that the best you can do ? You 're gonna have to kill me ! What shall we do with a drunken sailor on behalf of the studio , I demand that you cease transmission . Keep running . What shall we do with a drunken sailor early in the mornin ' ? Increase the wind . Increase the wind ! I 'm telling you for the last time . How close is he ? Very . Capsize him . Tip him over . Damn you , Christof ! You can 't . He 's tied himself to the boat ! Shut up ! He 's gonna drown , and he doesn 't even care . Do it . No . Do it ! That 's enough . Oh . Oh . I want to talk to him . Truman . You can speak . I can hear you . Who are you ? I am the creator of a television show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions . Then who am I ? You 're the star . Was nothing real ? You were real . That 's what made you so good to watch . Listen to me , Truman . There 's no more truth out there ... than there is in the world I created for you . The same lies . The same deceit . But in my world ... you have nothing to fear . I know you better than you know yourself . You never had a camera in my head . You 're afraid . That 's why you can 't leave . It 's ok , Truman . I understand . I have been watching you your whole life . I was watching when you were born . I was watching when you took your first step . I watched you on your first day of school . The episode when you lost your first tooth . You can 't leave , Truman . Please , god . You belong here ... you can do it . With me . Talk to me . Say something . Well , say something , goddamn it . You 're on television . You 're live to the whole world . In case I don 't see you ... good afternoon , good evening , and good night . Yep . Yeah ! Yeah ! He did it . He did it . He did it ! He did it ! He made it ! Yeah ! All right , Truman ! Cease transmission . Ceasing transmission . You want another slice ? No . I 'm ok . What else is on ? Let 's see what else is on . Where 's the TV guide ?

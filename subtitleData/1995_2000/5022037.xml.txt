 " Early in the morning explosion levels tavern . " That 's great . " Deliveryman Irwin P. Freeley was critically injured " in the blast during an explosion at McGinty . " The gas line in the kitchen exploded at approximately 7 : 00 ... " Come on . Let 's go . Hey , anybody here ? Mr. Freeley ? Mr. Freeley , can you hear me ? Hey ! Smoke . Surprise ! Surprise ! Surprise ! Happy birthday ! Happy birthday , Gare . Mom . Dad . What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * Not too big a piece . He 's upset . Oh , he 's not upset . Yeah , you 're upset . You dummy up a fake paper . What do you expect me to be ? It 's not a fake paper . It 's just a fake front page . How were we supposed to get you to come down here ? You weren 't gonna throw yourself a party . Deliveryman Irwin P. Freeley . I.P. Freeley . Get it ? You 're upset . Yeah . It was your mother 's idea . Look , I appreciate the concern , but ... this is not something that you want to mess with . Now , can I please have the front page of the real paper ? All right , son , maybe we did go a little too far . We were concerned about you . It 's your birthday . Concerned about what ? About this , Gary . This is all you seem to do . You 're missing out on the good things in life . You-you need to have some ... fun . Your mother 's right , kiddo . Yeah . You need a little balance . Yeah . Friendship . When 's the last time you had a date ? I - I have lots of dates . I - I have companions that - Look , do we have to talk about this in front of Mom ? Let 's just say , I have lots of friends , all right ? Lots of friends , huh ? This is your birthday party . Look around . You can count your friends on one hand . Well , that 's because Crumb 's not here . Now , can I have the front page , please ? Well , all right . Ah - just one favor . What ? Do you remember Renee Callahan ? No . Renee Callahan . You were in the third grade together . You know , she had pigtails , she used to come around selling , um , campfire candy . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Mom ! Oh , no . No , no , no blind dates . Oh , no , but ... I told you . I ran into her mother at the Food King the other day . And you know what ? Renee lives right here in Chicago . No blind dates , Mom . Well , I knew you were probably gonna say that , but I just want you to reconsider ... Help ! Somebody help me ! See ? That-that is exactly why you don 't need to mess around with this . I 'm slipping . I 'm gonna fall ! Hey ! Please , somebody ! Hold on , and we 'll get you down ... Anybody ! Get a ladder ! ... somehow . Get a ladder ! I can 't hold on ! Just hold on ! Help ! I 'm falling ! It 's a Jump-O-Gram . Happy birthday ! BERNIE Yeah , that was great , Chucko . That 's not funny . Oh , come on , Gare . Where 's your sense of humor ? Hey , that 's not us . We didn 't do that . What ? It 's my cousin Joey . Happy birthday , buddy . Joey ! Check 's in the mail ! Oh , we 're just trying to lighten you up a little bit , son . I don 't need lightening up . Well , we looked in the paper . There 's nothing going on that needs your attention yet . Well , what about this , Mom ? Huh ? Woman mugged in a park . Now , I 'm-I 'm supposed to just let that happen ? Is that what I 'm supposed to do ? But that doesn 't happen for an hour . We 're your parents . We know what 's good for you . Come on , have a little of your birthday cake . Look , I-I-I know you went to a lot of trouble for all of this , and I-I appreciate that . It 's very nice of you , but I 've - see , I 've gotta get dressed , and I 've gotta go do what it is that I do . And I 'm gonna go do that . And , so , thank you . Thank you . Just getting older and more grumpy , that 's all . Thank you . Excuse me , Miss . You got a second ? Um , no , actually , I 'm in - I 'm in a hurry . The purse . Uh , no ! No ! Hey , honey . Hey , how you doin ' ? Ah - I 'm sorry I 'm late . Looks like we still have time to make lunch , though . Oh , I didn 't know that you - you were gonna bring friends . I didn 't . Oh . Well , can I help you , then ? Uh , our mistake . You all right ? Yeah , yeah . I think so . Um , how did you know that ... Oh , well , uh ... they didn 't look too friendly . I thought they might be after your purse , or ... Yeah , I think that was it . Look , would-would you like for me to walk with you for a while , or , uh , well , can I buy you another pretzel ? Is that a line ? Huh ? Oh . Is that a-a line ? I don 't know . Is it working ? Might be . Really ? Renee Callahan . Oh , Gary ... What ? Ow - what-what ? I don 't believe it . I fell for it again . Fell for what ? Renee Callahan from Hickory , Indiana ? Where are they ? Where are who ? Mom ? Dad ? You can come out now . What-what - well , did I - did I miss something here ? You don 't know when to quit , that 's the problem ! Gar-Gary Hobson . Look , you can quit acting like you 're not in on this , all right ? In on what ? ! The whole thing - the setup , the blind date . Blind date ? Yeah . You know , my mom gets in touch with your mom , so your mom can get in touch with me , so you can get in touch with me . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! You think that I had my mom get in touch with your mom to set us up ? Look , you can stop the act , sweetheart , huh ? Sweetheart ? I can - I cannot believe this is happening to me ! You know what ? You 're a very good actress , but I 've got more important things to do . So , good-bye , Mom , and good-bye , Dad , wherever you are . Renee , it 's been very nice seeing you again , but next time , just call . You had to do it , didn 't you ? What 's that , son ? I told you I didn 't want to be setup , but you had to go ahead and do it anyway , huh ? Come on , Renee Callahan in the park . You saw Renee ? Oh , yeah , I ... What are you doing to my apartment ? Feng shui . I saw it on the Discovery Channel . It 's very big in these , uh , Asian rim countries . What you do is you rearrange the furniture to focus your energy ... What did she look like ? Excuse me . We 're talking about feng shui here . How did you get her number ? I didn 't get her number . Wait a second . Watch your legs there , Ma . You 're telling me that you - you didn 't have anything to do with this ? About what ? Cross our hearts . Oh , I 'm so confused . I am getting lost here . Gary , what did you do ? You didn 't insult her , did you ? I mean , Betty Callahan is one of my dearest friends . Hello ? Oh , hi , Betty . Oh , no . Oh , dear . I - I am so sorry . There 's still time for you to jump out the window , son . Yeah . Yeah , give it to me . Well , of course . Of course I will . Well ... Too late . I have never been so humiliated in my entire life . Sure , you have . Remember that cruise we took to the Bahamas ? You got caught in the undertow , and your swimsuit went south . Hush . Now , Renee Callahan is a dear , sweet girl . Now , I don 't know what you said to her , but ... I didn 't say anything to her . Well , according to her mother , you insulted her . I didn 't insult her . And her mother . Look , if I insulted her , I 'm very sorry . But after what you two pulled this morning , what do you expect from me ? Well , I 'll tell you what I expect . I expect for you to go over and give that girl an apology . And so does Betty . And so does your father . I think your mother makes a good point , son . She 's still at work . Thanks , Dad . Well , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll go and I 'll give this girl a call , okay ? I - I 'll stop by and I 'll say hello . You know , I 've got things to do today . Well , I can help you with the paper . No , you don 't . I just want to help out . And look , you two , you-you stop with this Svengali stuff , or whatever it is . You 're too old for that kind of thing . You ... I can 't find it on the mainframe . Hello ? MAN The computer 's on . She 's still in there . Check the other wing . Look down here . Just go in there . Hold on , hold on , this way . Shh-shh . Hello ? Gary ? Renee . Wait , what are you doing here ? I just , uh , I stopped by your office because , uh - listen , at the park - I wanted to apologize 'cause my parents - I thought that my ... Okay , were you just talking to someone a minute ago ? No , see , I - no , I , I came by to apologize . You see , I wanted to say I was sorry for the , the misunder ... Okay , quiet , quiet . Huh ? Hold it . Police . Don 't move . You 're under arrest , both of you . Arrest ? What for ? Hands out in front . No , this is some kind of mistake . This is my office . Hey , look , we 'll straighten it out at the station . What are the charges ? I said we 'll straighten it out at the station . Give me your hands . Follow my lead . Quiet . Renee : Run ! Get up . Get up , Bobby , get up ! The side door . Come on , the fire door . It 's locked . Hurry up . What 's going on ? They 're not real cops . What ? They 're the muggers from the park . The park ? Yes . Okay , you drive . Oh , I don 't believe this . No more blind dates for me . Do you think we 're intruding ? Intruding ? We 're his parents . He loves having us here . Yeah , but his social life ... What social life ? He 's practically the Pope . Well , Ave Maria . Mom , Dad , do you remember Renee ? Oh , of course . Renee , you look ... great . Hi , um , Mrs. Hobson , Mr. Hobson . Long time , no see , Renee . Uh , I went down to Renee 's office , and , uh ... We ran into a little bit of trouble . Oh , dear . You kids got off to a fast start . Please , Dad . So who 's got the key ? That 's ... the trouble . Are you sure they didn 't follow you ? Hmm ? Oh , no , not , not a chance . See , we took the Eisenhower over to the Dan Ryan , the Dan Ryan down to the Stevenson . From the Stevenson , we hopped onto the Tri-State , and then a quick loop back around to the Eisenhower , and here we are . Believe me , with her directions , no one followed us . Hey , I got us here , didn 't I , huh ? Do you think that 's going to work ? Apparently not . Ouch ! Okay . Scrap the pen knife . Gare , where are you keeping the blowtorch these days ? Give me this . Now , now , why were those guys pretending to be cops ? Oh , well , probably for my research . What research ? Yeah , your mom told us you worked at a think tank , but she never told us what you were ... thinking about . Yeah , what is it - top-secret , high-tech , Tom Clancy kind of stuff ? It 's math , Dad . What ? You see , I am developing algorithms that can be used to help predict weather patterns . Oh . Uh , why would they want to steal your weather patterns ? Yeah , who 's chasing you - Al Roker ? Now , I say we call the police right now . No , no . She can 't do that . Why not ? Well , you see , my project is , is funded by a government grant , and I can 't do anything unless I talk to the Washington office first , and I-I had to sign a security agreement . So call ' em . We tried . Can 't . They 're closed . Um , they don 't open till 7 : 00 in the morning . Even the Home Shopping Network has 24-hour operators . I think you 're going to need bolt cutters there , Gare . Oh , do you have some of those ? Oh , yeah , I do . Yeah , I do , for every time that I get connected to someone with handcuffs , yes . There 's no need for sarcasm here , Gary . Looks like you kids are stuck until morning . Oh , no , what am I going to tell Betty ? Nothing , we tell Betty nothing . You kids are going to be here tonight . We are ? I am ? We 're all in this together . The eagle has landed . So , who 's up for Scrabble ? Aha . Handcuffed , remember ? Yeah . I got to get the paper . Oh , okay , easy . What 's the rush , what 's the rush ? Stay put , kids . I 'll get the paper . No , Dad , don 't do that . Don 't worry , I won 't let him read it . No ... Out loud . I - I won 't let him read it out loud . I mean , every morning ... Okay . Um , can I use the phone now ? I - I think I can get through now . Phone ? Yeah , uh , yeah . Morning . Phone number . Yes , this is Renee Callahan with the Wayland Corporation . I need to speak to the ... project manager . So ... cute . Oh , um , 7727 , " B " as in bravo , " D " as in delta , and " K " as in ... Knowledge . Kilo . Yeah , yeah . No . Uh , there 's something wrong at Wayland . I need to speak to someone about my data . No , I deleted the files . I have a disc with me . It 's the only copy . Oh . Yes , I understand . Okay . Someone will get back to me . Going over the boss ' head , huh ? It 's always risky when you start jumping the chain of command . Thank you , Elizabeth . Scrivener here . We have a problem . Renee Callahan . She wants to come in . Lawrence says she 's dealing on the side and trying to cover . Let 's give her an escort . Send the postman . Listen , I-I , uh ... Look , I-I 'm sorry about the , the , the sleeping accommoda - I hope you slept all right . Oh , hey , at least I had a bed . You should have seen me when I was an undergrad at the , uh , U.S.C. I can 't tell you how many nights I slept in the stacks at the library . Hmm . I still go there when I need time to think . Yeah . The park was , the park was , uh ... No , no , don 't start that again . No , no , I 'd like to apologize . Well , you should . Yeah . You see , it was a - well , it was a misunderstanding because I thought that my par ... No , you thought that the poor little math nerd was so desperate for a date that she had to have her mommy help set her up , right ? No , I didn 't think ... Of course you did . See , ' cause everybody wants to date Gary . Mr. All-American , baseball-playing , Stingray bike-riding , mowing everyone 's lawn with his shirt off - yeah , I noticed - teacher 's pet . I - It wasn 't All-American . It w - it was All-State . Whatever . Gary , my point is ... No , what , what I - what I 'm saying is , is , look , what I 'm trying to say is that ... I 'm sorry and that , uh , well , people , they , they change . I mean , you 've changed , you know . You 've changed . So , are you , uh , planning on shaving the rest of that sometime today ? Huh ? Oh , you want to raise your hand a little bit ? Let me . Hmm ? Don 't you trust me ? Don 't worry , I 'll be careful . Ow ! Something 's going on . In there ? You think ? No , not in there , Bernie . Renee 's job . It doesn 't make sense , Bernie . I mean , she predicts the weather . Big deal . Why would someone be after her ? Are you kidding me ? The weather is big business these days . If you could predict the next El Niño , you could make a fortune . How ? I don 't know . Umbrella sales . Don 't be such a baby . I 'm bleeding . It is just a little scratch . Gash . Scratch . So what 's it going to be , kids ? Hardware store , bolt cutters ? Yeah , but , um , there 's , there 's something else first , Mr. Hobson . I need a favor . Anything , kiddo . Okay , I need you to get something for me . Can I help you ? You sure can , hon . I got to clean out your Freon recondenser . That 's , uh , your air conditioning . But we didn 't ... It 's part of the service plan . There 's no extra charge , hon . Uh , it says here in the , uh , work order that it 's located above the kitchen , which is ... this way ? That way . Got you , hon . Thanks . All right , that 's $ 43.45 with tax . Is that cash or charge ? I - I can get this . I can do this . It 's a business expense . I can write it off . Sure . Uh ... Sorry . We got a problem here . What , are you over your limit ? No . Like that 's any of your business . What ? Uh , system is down . It 'll take a few minutes , all right ? Excuse me , Mr. Lawrence . We got her . She tried to use her credit card . Gerald 's Hardware . 8400 block State Street . Move . Yeah ? Sorry to bother you , but have we changed our building maintenance contract ? Why ? Can 't you do anything ? Lady , it 's not me . Gary , we have to go . Yeah , well , we got to get the bolt cutters . We ... No , we 've got to go now . Okay , but see , we 're kind of in a hurry here . I understand that . You understand that . The machine doesn 't understand that . Oh , we 've got to go . Oh . Hey , you can 't do that ! Wait ! What are you doing ? ! Listen to me . It 's them . Huh ? It 's them . Exactly . They traced my credit card . I mean , they ... must have . They can do that ? Oh , yeah , in their sleep . Listen . Oh , wait a second . Who is they , first of all ? What ... Hello , Gare , Lois . Uh ... I don 't think we 've had the pleasure . But obviously , you have . Ren ... Excuse me ? Renee Callahan , this is Chuck Fishman and Marissa Clark . Gary and Renee grew up together . Oh . It 's a long story . Well , we 'd like to , uh , hear about it , wouldn 't we , Marissa ? Gare ? Delivery for Gary Hobson . Hey , what are you doing ? ! What ... ? Oh , no . Hey ! Old boyfriend ? What , are you crazy ? ! What 's going on ? Um , I don 't know , but Renee 's kicking ass . I 'm staying out of it . Get up ! Freeze ! Nobody points a gun at my son . I got the disc . Did I miss something ? Pull , Chucko . I am pulling . You pull . How did you know that he was ... ? How ... ? Come on . How 'd you know he wasn 't real ? Facial hair . What ? Oh , Federated Courier Service has a strict grooming policy . There 's no goatees . Oh ... And-and how do you know that ? Okay , so I dated a Federated Courier Service man once for about three minutes . He looked so good in shorts . He had these calves that were just ... Look , enough with that , all right ? The ... We know the courier guy wasn 't real . Now , who sent him ? Well , they didn 't see us at the hardware store , right ? And Wayland Corporation has absolutely no clue where I am . That leaves Washington . You mean a government agent ? Wait . Didn 't you call Washington for help ? I did . And they sent someone to shoot you ? Well , now that sounds just like the government . What about all the karate ? Oh . My dad taught me . High school coach . No need to worry about that guy . He 's out cold . And just in case , I got the little guy watching him in the cooler . Guess what I bought on the way home . A hacksaw . Put ' em up here . Oh , now Bernie , be careful . I want to be the first guy to interrogate him when he wakes up . Yeah . Look , enough of that , Dad . Now ... Now , listen , you know , the-the federal government - they send an armed , uh , uh , courier guy here . Now , that gives me an idea you 're working on more than the weather at this , uh ... this think tank of yours . Oh , um ... it 's complicated . You know , I ... We got plenty of time . Go ahead . Okay , uh , this may sound a little far-fetched , but what would you guys say if I told you ... I can predict the future ? Well , this is gonna be very interesting . Okay , um , the theory goes like this . Certain future events are predictable by solving a complex series of partial differential equations or PDs . I don 't understand a lick of it . That 's okay . Um , most computers don 't , either . Not without the right code , which is what I 've been working on . See , Gary ? I told you not to drop out of second year algebra . I think this is a little different from algebra , Mom . So , you were saying ... Okay , long story short - Einstein said time is a river . With this code , I 'm trying to get the computer to predict what the next bend in the river is . Listen , how-how close are you to , uh ... to figuring this thing out ? I don 't know . But I may be closer than I thought . You see , all year , I 've been turning in my calculations to my boss , but last week , I discovered that he 's ... he 's changing the data . He 's simplifying it before sending it on to Washington . I mean , he 's making it look like I 've made no progress whatsoever . Well , why would he do that ? Again , I don 't know . Maybe he doesn 't want them to know how close we are . Or maybe this guy 's taking the information for himself . Well , wait . Who-who is they ? I mean , who 's funding your research ? The Department of Agriculture . You see , they want to forecast weather cycles , crop developments , famine relief . That 's why I took this job . I thought I could help people . Sounds to me like your boss wants to help himself . A fella could predict the future , he could make a killing in the stock market . No . You see , they 've been trying to apply PDs to Wall Street for years . Nobody 's had any luck . Not yet . As far as I know , I 'm closer than anyone in the world . Well , so , what 's-what 's on this disc ? Well , um ... this is two years of work . When I saw what was going on , I deleted all my files from the mainframe . This is the only copy . There 's stuff on here that my boss has never even seen . So , if there is a way to tell the future , it may very well be right there . Whoa . The , uh , fake delivery guy - he left . I don 't get it . I taped this guy 's ankles together with duct tape . How far can a guy hop ? He must have cut the tape . With what ? ! With scissors . Now , where did he get scissors ? From the desk . Wait a second . How did he get to the desk ? Well , it must have been when I went to the kitchen to get a soda . What ? I had a tickle . Don 't ... What ? This ... Wait a minute . It was on your watch . Gary , wait . Huh ? You left your post ... I have to go . A guy gets thirsty ! Go where ? Come on ! I don 't know who sent that guy . I don 't know who I can trust . Well , you can trust me . Right now , I don 't need any more complications . Oh , now I 'm a complication ? No . I just think it would be the safest thing for all of us if I just disappear for a while . I don 't want to cause any more trouble . Renee ! Look , you 're no trouble . Well , you want to talk about it ? There 's nothing to talk about . Can I sit down ? Mm . Mom ? Hmm ? How many chances you think you get ? Chances ? Yeah . You know , chances - happiness chances . Oh . 42 . Four ... Really ? I got a smile out of you . I haven 't seen that in a while . Huh . You were right about her . Well , you should listen to your mother . Gary , do you want my advice ? No , no ... Well , I 'm gonna give it to you anyway . Look , you are sitting here wondering if you 've let your best chance for happiness get by you . And you 're asking yourself , is this your last shot ? Well , you can just sit there and wonder about it , or you can go get the girl . WOMAN The library is now closing . Please take all materials to the circulation desk . The library is now closing . The library 's about to close . Oh . Gary , how did you find me here ? Well , you told me you , uh ... you liked it here . Oh . Well , what are you doing here ? I - I just ... Yeah . I just wanted to make sure that you ... that you were all right . Oh , I-I was gonna call . I ... You were ? Yeah . I mean , yeah . I ... Uh ... Well , I-I figured you were going to . Look , I was just ... We-we were all , uh wondering , you know , where you were gonna stay tonight . Oh . Don 't think my apartment 's really safe . Oh , right . Hmm . Gary . Thanks . Yeah . Someday you and I are gonna have a long chat . I just love these cinnamon r-rolls . These are the best . Hey , I 'm walking here . Get in the van ! Now ! Bernie ? ! Hey , what is this ? ! Go ! Go ! So , you just let them walk out on their own ? Gary , they are adults . Adult ? My dad ? Well , one of them 's an adult . Renee ? Um , you have a phone call . Oh , Renee ... Here you go . Hello ? It 's a shame it 's come to this , Renee . Lawrence , what do you want ? Well , you 've got something I want , and I 've got something you want . Don 't deal with him , Gary ! No negotiating with terrorists ! Remember the main ! I think you recognize the voice . I know you recognize the attitude . Are they all right ? Well , they will be when I get the disc . Fine . Where do you want to meet ? Washington Park . Yeah , yeah , 51st street side . Oh , that 's ... Wait a minute . No , no , no , no . 51st street side . Look . That 's unacceptable . Don 't make this difficult , Renee . There 's a warehouse , uh , Mackinall and 93rd . Meet in the parking lot out front . 10 minutes after eight . It 's a neutral place , wide open . There 's no possibility of a double-cross . No , how about I ... Look , take it or leave it . You have plenty of time to check it out . Do you want the disc or not ? Fine . Ten minutes after 8 : 00 . Awarehouse ? Trust me . You , um , you have a plan , right ? Kind of . Kind of ? Kind of . The disc ? What about my mom and dad ? Bring them out ! Mom ? Dad ? Don 't worry about us , Gare . We 're fine . Now , the disc . I guess I should be flattered you want my research , even if you are using it illegally . Well , there 's nothing wrong with making a little money . Okay , a lot of money . Still preferable to what the government was gonna do with your work . You mean feeding people , preventing famines ? You know who really pays our bills ? The Department of Agriculture . Try the Pentagon . Your research will be used to destabilize governments , quell rebellions , political unrest . No , I don 't believe you . Believe it . Suddenly there 's nothing wrong with a little capital gains now , is there ? Now , give me the disc . Verify it . Nobody move . Hey , Gare ? Gary ? ! Shh ... ! It 's the real thing . Everybody get down . Nice doing business with you . Everybody get down . Come on , get down ! Get down , now ! Into the trailer , troops . Get in the trailer ! Come on ! Get in ! Get in ! Nobody move ! You , in the trailer ! Come on ! Get out of the vehicle ! Get them up , get them up ! Federal agents ! FBI . Everybody , freeze ! Chucko , step on the gas ! Get us out of here ! Let 's go , spread them ! Put your hands behind your head ! Bernie , freeze ! Come on , you know the drill ! Everybody out of the trailer ! Renee , pleasure to finally meet you . You have some big fans in Washington . Yeah ? You have a funny way of showing it . We didn 't know if you could be trusted . You could 've asked . I believe you have a disc for me . I can 't give it to you . What you 've done is research . Pure research . What 'll happen with it , that 'll be on my conscience . Forget it . That belongs to the government . It 's ours . One way or the other , I 'm going to get it . Excellent . The explosion was a nice touch . Maybe someday you 'll tell me how you pulled it off . I doubt it . Well , you have my number . The worst thing is the government got the disc . Not quite . Wait a second , if that 's the disc , what do they have ? Did you see any of those government guys sneaking around the Gray Ghost ? No . Why ? My CD is missing ! What CD ? The Best of American Bandstand . It 's a classic . Not available in stores . You know , you gotta buy it on the tube . Your damn government can pay for their own CDs ! That 's pretty clever . I thought so . Wait , you know , they 're gonna come after you , don 't you ? Fine , you know what ? Suddenly my math skills have gotten really fuzzy . I don 't seem to remember a thing . Well , what about that ? You got a disposal in this joint ? All right , I 'm on it . So , um ... So ... Have a good time , son . Yeah , yeah , now , you sure you 're okay about this ? Are you kidding ? Go . Have a good time . And don 't worry if you don 't make it home tonight . We 've got the paper covered . Bernie ! Well , look , I 'm going to dinner and a movie and I 've told you where I 'm gonna be and you 've got the beeper number . Gary ! All right , but there 's two things in the paper we need to worry about . They 're in the Metro section and I circled them . You already told us about them , Gare . Here you go , dessert 's on us , pal . Wow ! I wish I had a camera . Hi . Uh , okay , well , thanks , Dad . And Mom , tell Betty I said hello . I 'm sure you 'll talk to her soon . Bye . Bye . Getting those two together was a good idea , hon . I have a feeling this is what the paper wanted all along . You want to drive ? Sure . Great . All right . Yeah . Um , Gary ? Hmm ? There 's one thing that 's still bothering me . The explosion at the warehouse . How did you know about it ? Well , uh ... And then there 's your parents ' abduction . And my mugging in the park . You know something I don 't ? All right . What if I told you ... that I get tomorrow 's newspaper today ... ev-every morning on my doorstop ... with a cat ? And you see , that way , I 'm ... I 'm able to , uh , predict the future . You almost had me there ! Except for the cat . I mean , had you said a dog , oh , I would have been all yours . If it would have been a dog , it would have worked , huh ? I wouldn 't believe it either . Dog ? Cat ? No way ! That 's pretty good . Oh , boy . Oh , boy .

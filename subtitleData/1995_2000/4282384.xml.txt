" # 1 DAD " You are going to be ok , Patrick . You are lucky I don 't kill you now . Your hands . - Who the hell are you ? - George Harper . You tell that to someone who 's not his head security . Now that 's try this again . Who are you ? That 's Jarod , alright ? Clarkston Pharmaceuticals . It makes a very popular anti-depressant , called Panalex . Jarod was an employee there for three weeks . - Who did he help ? - Nobody . Well , he wasn 't stealing the formula for ... vitamins . Hold on your jockeys A major shareholder in Clarkston is ... Mr. Raines ? Everyone needs a nest egg . Continue . It is a sound lead . It means nothing until we find Jarod 's emotional purpose . Jarod 's purpose is to harass the Center . He 's after my stock . If he were after your stock , you 'd be broke . Jarod is driven by altruism . You want him out there trying to help the Little Guy ? The answer is the Little Guy . If you want to find Jarod , find the person he 's trying to help . I want my dad ... Is he going to make it ? It 's too soon to tell . But he 's going to be there about for at least two more weeks . Look , Doc , I was a little rough on you back there , but ... You want Patrick back just as much as his father does . I understand . You said the kidnapper left a cell phone for you . - From now on , I occupy myself some . - Mr. Alambar . He saw me . By becoming George Harper , I brought the boy one more day of life . I want you to tell me how that happened . Mr. Harper got a note after three . He called me , said to meet at the phone booth . A limo drops off Patrick every morning to school , picks him up in the afternoon . Today , the driver found only this . Did you talk to this limo driver ? He found the backpack where Patrick usually waits . We 've known this guy for years , he 's been with us for a long time . But I 've been running new backfround check on him just in case . Mr. Harper is ready to pay off this bastard . But I know how these people think . I 'm a ex fbi , worked a few abductions . More than likely , they 'll probably kill Patrick just he won 't ID them . He is a professional . He wants us to feel a total loss of control , so he can fulfill his fantasy of power . What do you know about kidnappers , doctor ? When I was a boy , I was stolen from my parents . I can help you get Patrick back . But you 'are going to have to trust me . Otherwise by this time tomorrow , Patrick could be dead . Keep the phone . For now . " Patrick " A lunch box ! You will be starting special school soon , Jarod . It 's that why those teachers came to see me yesterday . Yes , it is . They say you have a gift . Of course I already knew ... You are gonna love it , Jarod . I am so proud of you , and I 'm the proudest mummy in the world . " THE HAYVENHURST SCHOOL " Is there something I can help you with ? You are a teacher ? I am George Harper . Oh , this is quite an honor . I am Judith Peck . Heavenhurst is a much better place since your scholarship funds ... You opened the school to a member of disadvantaged students . - I 'm sorry if I seemed a little surprised to see you . - I understand . I am here about my son . This is Martin Benton . He oversees security for this school . I am so sorry about this , Mr. Harper . Nothing like this has ever happened here , sir . I am shocked . I stongly urge to call the police . I cannot . It is one of the kidnapper 's demands . If I could just find something , anything that would help ... He was in session after school . - Reading studies , I think . - Reading studies ? - For the dyslexia ? - Right , he gets off around three . They were special led kids , most of the others ' gone by two . He doesn 't want to be single out . He hates being special . Right , he just wants to be a regular kid . That 's why he always reads his comic books in class . This is where he usually waits for his ride . - In there , right , Judith ? - Right . Is there anything we can do , Mr. Harper ? Yes , Nothing . Do not contact the police or the media . I beg of you . - Patrick 's life depends on it . - Of course . I was stolen . Taken from my home in middle of the night . It 's all coming back to me , Sydney . Repressed memories . They often resurface during traumatic events , Jarod . But those memories themselves , they are not as important as how you face them . How do you face yours ? How do you live with what happened to me ? Jarod , nothing can justify what happened to you . But what 've you been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years tells me something right ... It came out of something very very wrong . It 's like a nightmare . Now it keeps coming back in pieces . First , the fear . And then , the panic . Shooting to your nerves that night I 'm a child again . It 's dark , and I 'm alone . All I can think about is seeing my family again . I want my world to be like it was . When can I see my daddy ? Harper will pay , and you will get your cut . Tomorrow . Um , the kid is having his last meal right now . You are late . Clarkston Pharmaceuticals ... Jarod was a national rep in ... in Sunnyvale , California . You 've found any evidence of child abduction ? Why would he , Syd ? A hunch . Play the tape , Mr. Broots . Sydney , they made me do this . How do you live with what happened to me ? Jarod , nothing can justify what happened to you . But what 've you been doing out there in the wide world for the last two years - tells me something right ... - It came out of ... And for two years I have been saying you personal connection with Jarod has hindered this pursuit . This is proof . My conversations with Jarod are nothing new . They keep us from him . They keep him from disappearing . Sydney ... He 's right . Two million . I got what I could from Patrick 's room like you asked . But I still don 't see how it helps . I 'm going to be George Harper . I have to understand his life and the son 's . I don 't want the kidnapper to catch me on the lie . The limo driver is clean . I checked his past business associated with possible motives . Nothing . fbi files show no kidnappers with a simple ... At least , not the last five years . All we can do is hoping bastard keep his word and let Patrick back tomorrow . This is Patrick 's mother ? Chloe . A great lady . Passed away in 96 . Patrick loves puzzles . They help him to think . That 's what he always says . I bought him this one . Sometimes Mr. Harper 's working late , I help Patrick out . Yeah , well , kind of kids ... faster than me . Are you ok ? Dozen abductions I worked for the bureau ... I think some of these guys do to those kids just a ... We 'll get him back . " Patrick " Patrick . Patrick . Jarod . He 's waking up . Mr. Harper , my name is Jarod . He 's going to help us , Mr. Harper . Is Patrick here ? No , sir . He is not . But he 's going to be just fine . I promise you . Syd , we 've been ordered to Sunnyvale . Broots found this . Could be Jarod 's attended work . We 'll leave in an hour . Raines ' sending Willie with us to keep us honest about what he doesn 't know , that Sam is already on his way . I will be ready . I hate myself for siding with Raines , but the Creep 's got a point . The emotional umbilical you have with Jarod is ... becoming a problem . In your eyes . Jarod is doing your work out there , isn 't he ? - I could say the same about you . - Um . His mind games don 't work on me any more . You cann 't make that claim . Like you said , we 've been ordered to Sunnyvale . Has the kidnapper called ? Where is my boy ? He 'll be back by the end of the day , sir . When he was a new born , I was going to his room in the night to check on him . I standed over him , until my eyes were adjusted to the dark . When I saw him breath , I knew he was ok . New parents , they must be very nervous . New ? I still check on Patrick every night . But what could it do ? I should have been there . If you had been there , you would 've found the backpack not your driver . That 's all . Yes , since Chloe died , it 's just Patrick and me . I lost her in a room just like this . I promised to her we 'll be a strong family . Jarod . I 'll get him back . Need some help ? I am sorry . I was just trying to put myself into Patrick shoes . Well , you are in the right place . He always read his comic books right here . You must be lost . The kidnapper calls in less than 2 hours . I went to see Harper . You weren 't there . - What are you doing here ? - I am following you . - Why weren 't you at the hospital ? - I have two hours left . - There is still some time . - Time for what ? For this . He was here . He was buying comic books here . The kidnapper grabbed him over here . He emptied out the backpack , put a note inside and he left it across the street for the driver to find . And nobody saw a thing . Almost nobody . So that 's how your doctors do a sugar rush . There , Patrick . No plates ! The tape is useless . This kidnappers coverd his face . We are down to the wire . Got it . I want to check up on Harper before we get the call . I almost butt your little blow up back there . That was my office on the phone . And when I ran a background check on the driver , I ran one on you too . You 're a tough man to track , Dr. Pearce . Maybe that 's cos you died in 1979 . You didn 't pretend to be Harper in that phone booth , you made a deal with the kidnapper . How much is he paying you ? Look , I know that you think about Patrick like he was your own son . And you probably saw some pretty horrible things happened to children when you worked for the FBI . You are afraid the same thing is going to happen to him . But I swear to you all that I want to do is to help this boy . And I can 't help him unless I answer this phone call . Please , trust me . George Harper . Same phone booth , ten minutes . Ten minutes . Miss Parker , I 've got him . Go , go . The kidnapper 's probably watching . Get off here . I 'll maintain visual . You plan anything , I 'll kill you . I expected nothing less . I am here , I am here . Take the money across the street to the green garbage can . - When do I see Patrick ? - As soon as I get paid . How do I know you 're telling the truth ? Where is my son ? Hello . Harper , I said no law . What are you talking about ? The deal is off , the boy is dead . No , no , no . You are a businessman . Just name your price , I 'll pay it . Another two million in three hours . I see one badge , your son stops breathing . I want to talk to my son . I want to know that he is still alive . I love you , daddy . Intelligent boy you got , Mr. Harper . Who says he need special led ? Keep the phone , I 'll call . - What happened ? What the hell was that ? - It must be one of the kidnappers . Look , he wants another two millions in three hours . You got to get it . Now you know who you can trust . Can we trust this guy ? How do we know we can trust this guy ? We still have two hours left . Exponential algorithms . Yeah , I used to try to solve those since a boy . Those took my minds some place else . Just like Patrick uses puzzles . I never looked it like that . We 're going to find him . He knew . He knew . He said this to me just before he hang up . He knew that Patrick was in a special classes . He knew that he would be held after school late . But how did he know that he would be there alone ? Must be someone in this god-forsaken hospital who seeing Jarod . - Find anything ? - Bingo .

How much is my son 's life worth ? Harper , please . Please get me out of here . It 's too early to beg . Kidnapping victims , they usually last five point eight minutes before desperation sets in .

 9432020241-niner . Yes . Lt. Damphousse , this is a preliminary inquiry . You have not been formally charged . We 're going to ask you questions to determine if the matter should be pursued . Yes , sir . You are suspected of the following offenses : Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ... failure to obey an order or regulation ... and Article 99 ... misbehavior before the enemy . At this time , Lieutenant , you should know that you have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can be used against you in a military court of law . You have the right to an attorney ... which will be appointed for you if so desired . - Do you understand these rights ? - Yes , sir . And I wish to waive these rights and make a statement . In regards to Article 99 ... misconduct before the enemy ... Wild Card to Queen Six . Requesting coordinates for cargo drop . Queen Six to Wild Card . - Drop zone is four klicks from bull 's-eye on Vector 0-niner-0 . - Repeat . Over . - Bull 's-eye is vector 0-niner-0 . - Roger that . They say this planet didn 't have what it took to become a star . Looks angry about it . Visibility 's 30 meters on a good day . Sulfur dioxide atmosphere . Ground temps average 68.5 degrees Celsius ... at night . From what I 've been told , we should be evacuating troops ... instead of sending ' ' em supplies . - What do you hear ? - This battle 's been going on since the beginning of the war ... even though a lot of people think there 's no strategic value . One guy told me there 's a high rate of M.I.A.s. I heard friendly fire . Thousands of casualties , and neither side gains any ground . It 's got some weird hold on the brass . They call it " Tartarus " , the place beyond hell . All right . Lose the scuttlebutt . Grab your gear . Get ready to unload . They travel 10 light years in a vacuum , and they 're still alive . Roaches 'll outlive us all . Got to give ' em credit . I 'll give them the back of my steel-reenforced boot . We 're about to touch down . Go to black ? Red . Go to red . 58 , this is the flight deck . Prepare for touchdown in 50 feet . Forty feet . Thirty feet . Twenty feet . Ten feet . Five , four , three , two ... Let 's do it . - Help . Help . - There 's a guy out there ! - Let me in ! - There 's another one ! - Let him in ! - Looks like a whole platoon . Come on ! Come on ! Take cover ! Tell the pilot to pull out ! - I can 't see anything ! - Shut the hatch ! The flight crew 's dead ! The two left engines are dust ! There ! - How many Chigs are there ? - I only see one . And it ain 't a Chig . He 's one of ours . I can 't get a bead on him ! Visibility is , like , zero ! - Why are we just sitting here ? - He 's one of ours . Maybe he thinks we 're an enemy ship . Wang said you can 't see . He gunned down those marines . They came from his position . That guy 's probably Section Eight . Queen Six to Ace . We 've established geosynchronous orbit over your position . Unable to descend due to high wind velocities . Radio contact difficult . Continue emitting homing beacon every five minutes . Ace to Queen Six , in contact with friendly fire . Repeat , friendly fire . Please advise . I doubt he received transmission . I 'm receiving this guy 's transmission , loud and clear . If this grunt 's so far gone to fire on us , I say we put him out of his misery . We can 't kill another marine . We outnumber him . We proceed in wedge formation and close in around him . Right , right . Contain him and bring him back . - Roger that ? - Fine . Gear up . Hawkes , let 's move . All right . Watch your step . Oh , God . This way . Watch out . - Look over here . - They 're all dead . What the hell happened ? God ! I count 12 bodies . God . Looks like the Chigs had a good day . Watch your step . What the hell is that ? Where ? Who ? Where 's it coming from ? What the hell is that ? Where 's that coming from ? Mean as hell . - Never , never , never quits . - Go . " E " ... Every day . " M " ... Mean as hell . " A " ... All the time . " R " ... Rough and tough . " I " ... In the mud . " N " ... Never quit . " E " ... Every day . Marine Corps ! Whoo-yaah ! Get down ! Take cover ! Take cover ! He 's out ! He 's out ! U.S. Marines ! Drop your weapon ! I don 't want to kill you ! But I want you to , sir ! - He said drop it ! - Put it down , Lieutenant ! Now ! - How afraid are you ? - Pull it together , Marine . - We 're here to help you . - How afraid are you ? There is nothing to be afraid of . Myself . I 'm afraid of myself . We all are ! We never once returned fire . Did you give the sergeant an opportunity to explain his actions ? Sir , you could 've given him a light-year ... and he couldn 't have explained his actions . Then , Lieutenant , perhaps you could explain yours . It was the light . The Chigs have wired this area with buzz beams . Watch your step . Move out in the direction you came . Check your six . Do it . What is this ? Get back to the ISSCV ! Move ! Move ! Move ! What the hell happened out there ? It was lightning . Some kind of volcanic lightning . I swear I heard a mechanical noise , like it was coming out of a gun . They were hot . I felt it through my suit . My head ! It 's like a headache , only back here . - I feel it too . - I 'm burned ! Get McQueen on the radio . Tell him to get in here now ! Joker to Queen Six , respond . Request immediate evacuation . Blood . I 'm bleeding ! What , you 've never seen your own blood before ? - Get this thing off me . Get it off ! - What 's your problem ? Blood . There 's blood on the suit . 'Phousse , all this going on , you 're afraid of a little blood ? Get it off ! Get it off ! Get it off ! Get it off ! - Get it off ! Get it off ! - ' Phousse ! - Get it off ! - Settle down . Settle down . Settle down . - It 's okay . It 's okay . - What the hell is wrong with me ? Easy . Easy . Wang 's calling McQueen . We 'll be out of here soon . Wang , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? It 's dead . I killed it . That bug 's not all that 's dead . And I 'm not just talkin ' about the radio . That marine was outside , so whatever 's affecting us comes from out there . The lights . Okay . - How bad is it ? - The control board 's cracked . Without it , the beacon can 't go up . - They 're never gonna be able to find us . - Thanks to you . If I could get another uplink prom ... I could jury-rig it enough to restore communication . The marine at the perimeter , he had a radio on his field pack . That 's right . AT-1540 L.O.S. satellite . There should be a cluster of uplink proms ... in a compartment in the bottom of the dish . - We only need one . - We have to go back out . If we don 't go out , we 'll never get out . The prom looks like this . You check for the green wires where they cross with the red . - What are you tellin ' me for ? - I 'm not goin ' out there . What ? You got a date or somethin ' ? There 's blood out there . - What ? - If one goes , we all go . My suit 's ripped . There 's no way I can repair it in time . I need to fix it before we 're evacuated . - I can handle it . - Okay , let 's move . - Whoa . Where 's your helmet ? - It 's harder to breathe with it on . The atmosphere is 80 percent sulfur dioxide . - You 'll be dead in 30 seconds . - Put it on . We 're goin ' out . Dereliction in the performance of duty is grounds for court-martial . Lt. Damphousse was the communications officer ... and therefore responsible for the operation and repair of the radio . - Is that correct ? - Yes , sir . Did she refuse to go outside the ship to facilitate the repair of the radio ? Does that accurately describe her actions ? It describes her actions , but not her . Tell us about the bunker . - It 's getting darker . - Kill the light ! You 're makin ' us a target ! - Next time you turn it on , it 's gonna be your head I smash ! - Stop ! Look out for those mines . Come on , Wang . Hurry up . It 's gettin ' tough to breathe out here . - Just give me a minute . - We don 't got a minute , bug man ! Shut up ! Shut up ! He can 't see . He needs light . We can 't see . No one can function in this darkness but you . You broke the light , and now it 's dark ! Shane , listen to yourself . Don 't you go on me . We can 't get all weirded out here . We got to hold it together ... at least until we get the uplinked prom back to the ship . You hear that ? Hear what ? Crying . A girl . She 's in pain . Crying . There are hundreds of marines out here . They 're all crying . She 's close . She 's real close to me . West . West ! Where did he go ? West , where the hell did you go ? I 'm Nathan West . I 'm with the 58th Squadron . We 're here on a resupply mission . Do you hear that voice ? I hear a lot of voices . Can you tell me ... This battle , those lights ... Do you know what 's going on here ? You shouldn 't have to ask . You 've been here before . Anytime you awake in the dark in a cold sweat ... moments before , you were here . Who are you ? I 'm not me anymore . The light took me away . Here the light is an enemy ... an ally with the darkness . There 's no place to run . There 's no escape . There are 10,000 battlefields in this place . I 've lost a battle . I 've lost the war . And you 'll lose too . We almost lost you in the ground fog . Nathan , what are you doing ? There was a sergeant in here . He was telling me about those flashes of light . I can 't see . - What is he doing ? - Don 't know . - But I ain 't going in there . It 's too cramped . - And too dark . Come in here , now ! If we go together , you 'll be all right . Do you see any roaches ? Oh , my God ! Oh ! Well , what killed ' em ? The Chigs ? Each other . What is this stuff about remaining silent ? Answer the question , Hawkes . Each of you wrote in your report that 10 trained marines ... killed each other for no apparent reason . They had their reasons . They might not have known ' em ... and you might not understand it , but they had their reasons . If you weren 't there , how do you know ? I was there ... and I was almost one of them . That 's all , Lieutenant . He couldn 't explain his actions . " It wasn 't her . I was almost one of them . " It 's like they can 't explain what happened down there . I think it 's obvious , Colonel . They won 't explain what happened . They 're covering for Damphousse . They 're covering for each other . - They killed each other . - They killed each other ? Are you sure it wasn 't the Chigs ? No . This is an M-590 impact wound , fired from point-blank range . This lieutenant died from multiple stab wounds . She did it . K-bar 's still in her hand . He 's got the same burns that ... Say it , Wang . That we all have . I don 't mean nothin ' by it . I 'm just sayin ' ... What he 's sayin ' is that we have to assume we 've all been exposed to it . The sooner we accept it , the sooner we can focus ... on not giving in to the effects and ending up like them . All right . We all got burned by those lights . - And that 's when Damphousse started freakin ' out . - And Wang . You weren 't exactly displaying the nerves of a brain surgeon ! Shut up ! We 're all a little scared here . All right ! And we all had headaches in this area . That 's where the amygdala area is . Come on . Why do I know I ain 't gonna be followin ' this real good ? It 's a collection of neurons that houses fear memories . Injections in that area decreased posttraumatic stress in A.I. war veterans . Now , I swear ... I heard an electronic pop before the flashes , like a bomb . What if the Chigs have developed a weapon that could effect ... the area of the brain that houses fear memories ? It would increase our phobias to the point of complete incapacitation . An electronic nerve gas that causes us to turn on each other . Well , why not just carpet bomb the area ? Why bother investing troops into battle ... when you 've got a weapon that causes the enemy to turn on itself ? Can you imagine a large-scale weapon like that deployed over New York or Los Angeles ? Actually , you might not be able to tell any difference . The Chigs must know fear . Right . How can you take advantage of a weakness ... unless you know the power in using it ? The Chigs must know us . If the pain in the area has decreased , then maybe it wears off . Yeah , might . But our resistance would be lower if we get hit again . Our fears will intensify . There it is . If we go out , we could get hit by those lights . We 've got to go back out . We have to fix the radio to get the hell out of here . And we 've got to get back to Damphousse . Okay . All right . But if we get hit , we have to get each other through . The only way we 're gonna be able to get through that fear is if we acknowledge it . But this thing , it 's beyond fear . First Lt. Vansen ... Shane Autumn , 5605103184 . You were the commanding officer of the supply mission . - Yes , sir . - Did you give Lt. Damphousse an order to repair the radio ? - Yes , sir . - Did she willfully disobey that order ? - Yes , sir . - Was she physically incapable of executing the order ? No more than the rest of us . So , by your own words , Lt. Vansen ... Lt. Damphousse was derelict in her duties . No , sir . Lt. Vansen , you are contradicting your testimony . May I warn you that as commanding officer ... you may be held accountable for the actions of your subordinates . Look ... Sirs , I know that the point of all this ... is to get us to turn on one another ... but you are wasting your time . - How 's that , Lieutenant ? - Because we already have . It 's so dark out here . Hang in there , Shane . The ISSCV should only be 25 meters ahead . Keep goin ' . Do you hear that ? I heard a click ! Nobody move . One of us stepped on a buzz beam . It 's me . - Don 't move . - Oh , damn . And I was just about to start doing the hustle . - What do we do ? - Shane , you got a field mirror ? Oh , yeah . I could use a touch-up just before being shredded into pieces . We can deflect the beam . Okay , left thigh pocket . - What are you doing ? - I 'm trying to find the precise angle . If it 's a right angle , it deflects the beam down , not up , right ? - Up , not down . - Down is up . Up is down . - Oh , God . - Ain 't physics a bitch ? Yeah , ain 't it though ? - It 's getting darker . - Stay with us , Shane . Don 't go off . When Wang says " now " , you go . Almost . Almost . - Just get it off ! - Don 't move ! - Get it off ! Get it off ! - Hang on . Almost got it . Okay , go ! Get it off ! - Come on . Get back . - Where is it ? Use your cover ! Use your cover ! - Nathan , find me . - Get in here . - I have to go back out . I have to help her . - Shut up ! It opens from the inside . - Damphousse , open the door ! - This ain 't gonna happen . Vanessa , open the door ! - Damphousse , open the door ! - I can 't ! You have to understand , I can 't go into the room . Damphousse , open the damn door ! - Come on ! Open the damn door ! - I can 't . Open the door ! I know what we said out there . I 'm sorry . But unless this door 's opened , I 'm gonna start throwin ' out bodies ! This should hot-wire the door . Don 't make me go in there . - Vanessa , put it down ! - Damphousse ! I 'm not goin ' in there ! - Don 't do it , ' Phousse ! - This is not us ! There 's a weapon . We 're all effected . It 's hard , but keep your head . I have the part . We need you to fix the radio so we can get out . - There 's blood on the floor . - Fix the radio ! Listen ! Listen ! Understand , I love you ... but if any of you try to make me go in there , I 'll have to kill you ! Fix the radio , or there 's gonna be blood on the floor where you 're standin ' . Stop this ! Stop ! This is not us ! Now , if we do this , the Chigs win . We can beat them . Now , put down the guns . All of us . Vanessa , what if we cleaned it up ? - I 'll know it had been there . I 'm not goin ' in . - Okay . But I 'll talk Shane through fixing the radio . - Okay , put down your gun . - When McQueen evacuates us . If McQueen evacuates us ! - Shane ! - I can 't fix the radio if I can 't see . I 'll turn on the lights . Now , put down your gun . I 'm not turning over my gun when one is pointed at me ! - Me neither ! - I 'm not only not giving mine up ... Cross this line , and you die . So much for workin ' together . - Go to the radio . Go ! - Wang , the lights . No . That 's a great space for roaches to hide . Remove the control board panel . In the upper left-hand corner , there 's a blue plastic chip . That 's the frequency converter . Beneath it , there 's an uplink prom . Replace it . Increase the frequency range to 52.1 gigahertz . Okay . Okay . Queen of Diamonds to Queen Six . Come in , Queen Six . Turn on the beacon . Queen of Diamonds to Queen Six . Request immediate evacuation . What are you doin ' ? Get back to the radio . That sounded like an A.I. transmission . It was dark the night they killed my parents . Dark . Just dark . Dark . I ... I could never lose that fear . I could never lose that fear . Oh , I can 't . I ... I can 't . Shane , there 's nothin ' there . Nothin ' . Nothin ' . It 's just static . You 're telling me it 's nothing ? Don 't tell me it 's nothing ! You 're hearing your dead girlfriend 's voice ! - Hold your fire ! - It 's just a bug ! Just a bug ? Just a bug ? No ! No ! When I was a kid growin ' up in that hellhole ... when I 'd wake up , I 'd see ' em on my pillow and on my face ! I 'm not goin ' back there , man . I 'm not ever goin ' back there , man ! - So don 't tell me it 's just a bug , man . - Get back . Oh , are you feeling a little closed in ? Get away . I may have come into life in a box ... but I will make sure you go out in one . Sayonara , baby . Stop it ! Guys , this is not us ! - They 're making this happen . - Make ' em stop . Why don 't you come in here and make ' em stop ? It 's just blood . It won 't hurt you . Chigs ! Wild Card , this is Queen Six . Wild Cards , come in . - Come in , Queen Six . - Where the hell have you been ? We lost your beacon two hours ago . We need immediate evacuation . Roger that . We 're out here waiting for you ... 75 meters northeast of your position . - That 's across the minefield . - You 're across a minefield . It 's the only spot to set a vehicle down . Now , let 's move ! The weather gives us about a five-minute launch window . And , uh , watch your step . - We can 't handle that . - What if we get hit by the lights ? The minefield 's only 25 meters long . We felt the effects wear off before . If we get out , we make it across , we don 't get hit by the lights again ... we 'll be okay . Let 's hold it together . It 'll be all right . 'Phousse , come on . Come on , ' Phousse . Let 's go . Come on , Damphousse . The transport is here . Let 's go . You can do it . You can do it . Let 's go . You 're a marine . Vanessa , don 't ! Hawkes ! - We 've gotta get through this ! - Get his head ! - Get his arms . - No . No . We gotta get through this . Keep it together , man . Stop ! Stop , man ! A single line . Step in Paul 's tracks . " M " ! Mean as hell ! - " A " ! - For all the time ! - " R " ! - Rough and tough ! - " I " ! - In the mud ! - " N " ! - Never quit ! - " E " ! - Every day ! - " S " ! - Semper fi ! Semper fi ! Semper fi ! Semper fi ! Semper fi ! - Colonel McQueen ! - Help the others . West ! West ! West ! West ! Vansen , get back here ! - Tell the pilot to give us 30 seconds . - Yes , sir . Nathan , stop . What are you doing ? I 'm ... I 'm afraid that I won 't find her ... that I 'll fail . Hey , it 's not her . It 's not , Nathan . The light 's telling you that . It 's not you . You ... You know you 'll find her . Come on . It 's gonna be okay . Come on . - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Vansen , West , get in here ! - Come on . - Let 's go . Let 's go ! - Queen Six to Home Base . - Queen Six . Go ahead . - We 're coming home . - Roger that . - They 're gonna get me . - Then they should get all of us . Look , we all told them about the lights . We 've all got these burns , physical evidence . They 've gotta believe us . If they believed us , there wouldn 't have been an inquiry in the first place . Look , it 's what each of us didn 't tell them . That 'll make the difference . Whatever happens , I want you guys to remember ... that when we were in the thick ... Paul kept saying it ... " This isn 't us . " But there was that small part that was us ... that kept us alive . The inquiry panel has voted against any further investigation . - They won 't pursue charges . - So , did you believe us ? We believe you were subjected to an unknown Chig weapon . If we 've learned anything in this war ... it 's that the enemy down there is capable of anything . Get some rest . You earned it . Thanks . They enemy was down there ... but it wasn 't the Chigs . Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

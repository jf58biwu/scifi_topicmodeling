 - It 's too soon . - It 's okay . The cemetery 's closing for the night . It opens again tomorrow morning at 8 : 00 . Okay . Hello ? Is somebody in there ? Who the hell are you ? What in the name of God do you think you 're doing ? This is a desecration . Since the beginning oh time mankind has existed between the world oh light and the world oh darkness . Our secret society has been here horever protecting others hrom the creatures who inhabit the shadows and the night . Known only to the initiated by our true name The Legacy . Did they hit any other display rooms in the hall ? I don 't know . You 'd better speak to the detective on the case . I 'm just the assistant curator . I 'm sorry , Dr. Rayne , I know how much this gallery means to you . Where are the police ? Why aren 't they here ? They 've come and gone already . What did they find ? Did they test it for fingerprints ? In a museum , it would be hopeless . There 'd be so many . Who would do something like this ? Is there anything missing ? Unfortunately , we were about to start our yearly inventory . But with all the labels missing and everything in disarray it 's going to take twice as long . Well , if I can be of any help let me know . Miss Blake , was it ? Miranda Blake . Thank you , doctor . Thank you for your help . Thank you . Mother , I 'm home . Hey , Ernie . Is everything all right ? - Who is it ? - It 's ... - It 's just me , Mom . - Oh , Miranda . Oh , I 'll get it . - Hello ? - Miranda . Who is this ? It 's probably that same prank . Please , who is this ? All I could hear was his breathing . Miranda . Is everything okay ? Fine . - So how 's your new medication ? - I didn 't take it . It 's too big . How are you gonna get better unless you do what the doctors say ? - Where are you going ? - I 'm going to wash up for dinner . The police are looking into the incident but they think the whole thing 's very unusual . - In what way ? - Usually the thieves are after a specific piece . Only this time , they decided to stop and create mayhem . Exactly . As if they came in purposely to destroy things . We 'll have to see when the inventory comes in . What do you think of Miranda Blake ? Competent . A bit flustered , but that could have been your fault . Now , don 't be silly . As soon as she completes the new inventory , I want to know . What 's missing might tell us who the thief is . Then we should also consider what 's been destroyed . - Exactly . - Right . And if you come up with anything even a hunch , I wanna know . For heaven 's sake you don 't have to treat me like a child . I am perfectly capable of putting myself to bed . I know you are , Mom . Get a good night 's sleep . You need your rest . Why ? Pretty soon it 's all I 'll be doing . - I wish you wouldn 't say that . - Well , it 's the truth . You spend too much time worrying about me . Ever since Anton ... You need to get out more , find yourself another young man . - I don 't want another . - Nonsense . Of course you do . Good night , Mother . Where are you now , my love ? Yeah , yeah . Hey , man . Yo , get out of there ! Hey , yo . What , you deaf or stupid , man ? I said , get ... Let me go ! Come on , man , no ! Please , somebody ! Derek . - Alex , is that inventory done yet ? - That 's what I came to tell you . It 's been two days , and I haven 't heard a thing . Have you called Miranda Blake ? Twice . I left a message on her voicemail . She hasn 't called back . This is Miranda Blake . The Winston Rayne Hall oh Antiquities is presently closed . Lh you wish to leave a message , please do so at the tone . I will get back to you soon . Told you . Hi , Miranda . This is Derek Rayne . Can you please call me so we can discuss whatever items may have been taken during the break-in at the museum ? Antiquities , Miss Blake . - How are you ? - Better , thanks . I 've been monitoring my calls , trying to finish this inventory . - How 's it coming ? - Almost complete . - In hact , I was just about to call you . - Excellent . How soon can we see it ? Hopefully this afternoon . Good . I 'll send a car . Why don 't you bring it out ? Bring it myself ? Right . So we can go over it together before we reopen the collection to the public . Yes . Oh course . I 'll see you this afternoon , then . Say , around 3 ? - I 'll look forward to it . - Me too . - Bye . - Bye . What ? Nothing . It 's just nice to know she talks to one of us . - Thank you . - You 're welcome . - So you made it . - Dr. Rayne . Yes . Thank you . - Call me Derek , please . - Derek . I 've always wanted to see inside this house . Well , be my guest . Oh , is that what I think it is ? The armor of Edward , the Black Prince . Who wore it at his first great victory over the French at Crécy in 1346 . Please . So did you come to specialize in the Middle Ages by chance or by design ? Both , I guess . I was visiting Winchester Cathedral when I realized this was what I wanted to do with my life . I was looking up at the stained-glass window over the main altar . The blue ground , with the figure of St. George battling the dragon . - Do you know it ? - Oh , very well . On weekends , I used to take a train from Oxford to study the windows . - You were at Oxford ? - Yes . So was I. My room looked out toward the river . The most beautiful view I 'd seen . Well , my room had a view of a brick wall . Please . So do you work all the time or occasionally take time out ? - Until recently , I was engaged . - Oh , I see . And that has been broken off ? Yes . Oh , I almost forgot . The inventory . - Any serious damage ? - So far , no . All that mayhem and nothing destroyed ? That 's curious . Well , I suppose that it is . I guess I hadn 't considered it . I was ... I was simply relieved . And what 's missing ? Surely something must have been taken . - No , nothing . - Well , there must be something . No . No , nothing . I 'm certain . I expect to have the records collated by tomorrow . Thursday at the latest . I 'm sorry . I 've really gotta go . I have so much work to do at the museum . Of course . I understand . Hopefully , next time you can stay a little longer . Yes , I 'd like that very much . Anton ? Miranda ! Thank you for bringing her home . She 's had a terrible shock . She needs rest . This Anton Lazaroff . - She knew him well ? - Why , they were engaged . Was his death unexpected ? Anton isn 't dead . - He 's not ? - Of course not . I 've heard what people have said . But that was just to hide the fact that Anton left Miranda because of me . - Why would you think that ? - It 's the truth . If Miranda didn 't have me to care for why , he would have married her without a second thought . Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get old , Mr. Rayne ? The strangest thing . You wake up in the morning , and you lie there in bed and you think of all the things you have to do and you feel just the way you did at 25 . And if you stay there long enough you could almost believe you haven 't changed at all . And then you have to get up and go wash your face and there in the mirror is a stranger staring back at you . And you ask yourself : " Who could this stranger be ? " Well , life is for the living , Mrs. Blake . No matter your age . What makes you so sure Anton is still alive ? Well , I spoke to him . - When ? - This morning right after Miranda went to work . I told him I was sorry he went away and that all I wanted for Miranda was her happiness . - What did he say ? - Nothing . He hung up . You know , I 've been over this material three times . It still doesn 't add up . - What doesn 't ? - The inventory documents sent over from the museum don 't match our own archives . Really ? Who did them ? The assistant curator , Miranda Blake . It doesn 't look like someone 's being careless . It looks like the confusion 's deliberate . What , you think that she purposely messed with the records to hide the fact that she took something ? Maybe the idea of making it look like simple vandalism takes pressure off what really happened . - Is that right ? - You 're back . Is everything all right ? I 'm not sure . I need you to do a complete rundown on a man named Anton Lazaroff . The violinist ? I thought he was dead . I 'm sure I read an obit on him a couple of weeks back . - You did . Only I 'm not sure it 's true . - Why not ? Because he was engaged to Miranda Blake . And after she was here today , I followed her to the cemetery . Anton 's body isn 't in the crypt . You think somebody snatched it ? Maybe . Or maybe he isn 't really dead . How can this be ? I 've made my peace . Accepted my fate . What right did she have to rip me from my eternal rest ? Was it love ? Is that the reason ? Then she must be taught to grow old together is a lie ! To die together that 's the only truth ! I must make her understand . Death is the only path . United for all eternity . The time has come , my love , to set you free . Derek , you shouldn 't have come over . How you feeling ? And you shouldn 't have followed me to the cemetery . I 'm just trying to help you . I need you to tell me the truth . The truth about Anton Lazaroff . What 's there to tell ? He was my fiancé . He died . I don 't want your pity and I don 't want your condolences . All I really want is Anton back . It cannot be done , Miranda . So they say . I 'm sorry . Yeah , we can talk some other time . - Okay . - Get some rest . - Derek ? - Yes ? Do you believe that the dead forgive us ? For what ? For our folly . Yes . I 'm sure they do . How is she ? Shaken , but she 'll live . What did you find out on Anton Lazaroff ? Among other things , his obituary . According to the Chronicle , he was a world-class violinist . Old money , parents dead , he was an only child . - How about cause of death ? - An aneurysm , without any warning . He died on-stage during a rehearsal of an adagio he recently composed . They say he was an eccentric guy . He even demanded to be buried with his violin . Well , they said when Paganini played he had the devil on-stage to assist him . Well , nothing here indicates that Anton went that far . But if he 's not in the crypt how can you be so sure ? Are you sure this is everything in the current collection ? Well , the numbers have been altered , apparently to conceal this . - The Bell of Girardius . - It 's the only piece still missing . Remember what it was used for ? Yeah , vaguely . Services for the dead , wasn 't it ? Close . Summoning of the dead . It was made in 1412 by the goldsmith Girardius . He made it for this mad Austrian countess whose only son had died . Oh , yeah , I remember now . The bell was buried in the boy 's grave to absorb the aura of death . And then when the bell was dug up and rung three times the boy came back to life . - Well , assuming it really worked . Supposedly the boy went mad and the only way to stop him was to ring it again . Is that what killed him ? According to the legend . So Miranda stole the bell to bring Anton back to life . That 's what I intend to find out . Miranda ! What 's going on ? Are you there , Miranda ? I 'm here , Mother . Everything 's fine . Go back to sleep . Anton ! Miranda , open the door . I need to talk to you . I don 't believe the omission was accidental . I believe it was intentional . But who would do that ? You would , Miranda to keep us from discovering the Bell of Girardius had already been taken . And then you staged the entire act of vandalism to cover up the theft . But I am a curator . Do you honestly believe that I could deliberately destroy artifacts ? No . That 's what gave you away . Despite the mayhem , nothing was actually damaged . Why would I do such a thing ? To bring your lover back from the dead . You buried the bell in his coffin then rang it to wake him . Miranda you have to send him back . The bell 's created enough havoc . It must end now . - I don 't know what you mean . - You saw the body in Anton 's crypt . Who do you think killed him ? Whoever removed Anton . - Or Anton himself . - No , that 's impossible . Nothing is impossible . If Anton were alive , he would never be capable of murder . He was ... He was gentle and caring . Whatever 's come back from the dead , it 's not Anton . It 's something else . I think you better go . Don 't be foolish . Think about what I 've said . We 'll talk again in the morning . Miranda . You brought me back . It worked . How ? Why ? The Bell of Girardius . Because I love you , Anton . Love ? Yes . Ours was strong . - Do you still love me ? - Oh , yes . No matter what ? Yes , always . What have I done ? I need to take you back with me . The bell . Where is it ? - It 's in my room . - You rang it ? - Yes . Three times . - And if you ring it again ? Then you will return to the dead forever . Together in death . Never to part . Now . Forever . Oh , Anton , please . Please . I could never go on without you again . Even in my coffin , I wanted you with me . L ... I ... I need time . I need time . I have to say goodbye to my mother . And you 've gotta understand . Just wait here for five minutes . - Five minutes ? - Five minutes . You can wait here . I know how I look . But all this will disappear once you come with me . You 'll see . Death is so much sweeter than life . I had to kill him . He wouldn 't stop . Miranda ! Miranda , don 't leave ! Miranda ! Open the door , Miranda ! I 've got to save you , Miranda ! We were meant to be married , Miranda . It 's still possible , even in death . Together forever ! Miranda ! Miranda . Miranda ! You left him there ? Alone in the cellar ? It 's me he 's after . He wants me to return to the dead with him . So I bolted the door . I told my mom not to leave her room . I don 't know what to do . You 've gotta help me . Give me the bell . Anton ! You must confront Anton and ring the bell again three times . Are you up to it ? - Lf you 'll go with me . - Every step of the way . Ernie ? Are you in there ? Is that you ? No , Mrs. Blake . It 's Anton . Miranda said that you were here , but I didn 't believe her . She said not to let you out . Why would she say that ? I 'm not gonna hurt you . Why don 't you open the door , find out for yourself ? No , I ... I don 't think I should do that . I think I should wait for Miranda and she 'll know what to do . I 'm very thirsty . Can I have some water ? And then , of course , I will come right back here . All right . But you 'll have to go right back until Miranda comes home . I understand . Just open the door and let me get a drink of water . And then I will go right back . I 'm sure Miranda will understand . This bolt is very stiff . - Take the bell . - No . Let me get him to the mausoleum first . I owe him that . - What if he doesn 't want to ? - Then we 'll do it your way . - Mother ! - She 's going to be all right . I don 't think he hurt her . - I mustn 't ... - We can 't take any more chances . Go to the car and get the bell . Anton 's got to be here somewhere . We have to finish it . It 's all right . - No , no . She 'll be very angry . - It 's all right . I knew you would come back ! Yes . I need an ambulance . Oh , no ! Let go of me ! Let me go ! We have so much to share now in death . I was wrong , Anton . Our chance is over . I don 't wanna die . You know nothing about death . How could you ? How could anyone ? Death is silent and serene . It 's nothing like this . No decay no change . It 's like music . No longer playing yet haunting in its melody . It 's like nothing I could say in words . Where could you go that I couldn 't find you ? You 're hurting me . Please , Anton ! The bell ! Put it down ! - Don 't do it ! - Do it ! It 's your only chance ! - No , Miranda ! - I 'm sorry , Anton . Don 't ! No ! No ! Thank you , Derek . I 'm so sorry for everything . It 's done now . It is . It 's strange . Until now I believed that love was strong enough to overcome anything . Even death . But it isn 't . No . It isn 't . Love has no past , no future . Just the present . Cherish the moment when it comes for , all too soon , it may slip away .

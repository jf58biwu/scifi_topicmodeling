Originally , they used to say , " couples skate next . Two girls may not skate together . " And then , like , a couple of years later , they 'd say , " couples skate . " Two girls may not skate together . Two boys may not skate together . " But they 'd say it like , " who 'd have figured ? Twoboysmay not skate together ! " Are we rolling ? How do you do ? How do you do , ladies and gentleman ? We 're home . Later in the program , we 'll be talking to a nice gentleman named slash . Oh ! Ow ! I 've thrown my back out . Worker 's comp ! Aah ! Had you going . Hulk , do you know slash 's last name ? That 's his whole name . - Neither did Henry . - He didn 't even have a mouth .

I don 't think anybody like you or any of the little space ghost kids out there , all those fans of yours , should ever try any - wrestling holds at home . You should never put the sleeper on your boys and your little girlfriends and ... bleh ! Ok , hulk , whatever . It looks like you 've been eating those space cheeseburgers . I 'm looking at your waist , and that belly of yours is hanging out so far , I don 't even think you can see your shoelaces when you tie your space tennis boots . My laces are velcro . So tell us , what 's new in the incredible world of hulk ? A brand-new tv series calledthunder in paradise , where I get to play an action-adventure hero on tv every week . An action-adventure hero ? Oooh ! Why didn 't I think of that ? And you fight crime , right ? That 's original ! Hey , do you beat up any bad guys ? Maybe come to the rescue of a few distressed citizens ? Uh ... sure ! Maybe even save the day while you 're at it . Well , you know , dude ... been there , done that ! See ya . Moltar , give him a copy of the home game . Please welcome my next guest ... slash . Yeah ? Ok . What 's happening ? Well , I 'm space ghost . What 's happening ? Then you 'd probably ask me a question I couldn 't answer , and I 'd feel like a real idiot . No , no , no . Don 't you worry your pretty little head about anything . Ok . - Are you ready ? - I think so . Ok , citizen slash , welcome to the show . You 're from earth , right ? Yeah . How many clouds does earth have ? You know , son , if you were a paramedic , people would be dead already . Next question . Citizen longhair , when you 're on tour , do you ever miss your mommy ? I can 't hear you . Are you even listening to me ? - Yeah . - Hello ? - I 'm here . - I just said yeah . - Whatever . - Whatever , son . Stupid answer to a stupid ... what ? Never mind .

 - Dad ? - Dad ? Is that you ? - No ! - No ! No ! [ Engine Starts ] Mama ! [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] Mr. Fenigor , who killed my mother ? Jarod 's father . [ Miss Parker ] Daddy , it 's the truth . Mother 's death was not what we thought . She was gunned down in this elevator byJarod 's father . - Fenigor told you this . - He 's dying in the Centre infirmary . He has no reason to lie . - He extorted a lot of money from this place . - This place ? Or you ? I didn 't want him telling lies . - About your mother . - Are they lies ? [ Exhales Sharply ] Hope I 'm , uh , not interrupting . - Keep hoping . - Angel , please . Your sister 's obsessed with finding Jarod 's father instead of the real target . Funny you should mention Jarod , Dad . - He put this Web site on the Net . - [ Mr. Parker ] Can we trace it ? [ Miss Parker ] No . We 've tried similar leads before . She 's right . It 's unlikely , but I 'm workin ' on it . All right . Keep me informed . - Keep us both informed . - Oh , of course . And while I 'm tracking Jarod , you 'll be , what , after his father ? I find his father , I find him . [ Chirping ] [ Bird Screeches ] [ Man ] You gonna have somethin ' ? Actually , I was supposed to meet someone here . And I 'm supposed to sell drinks . [ Jarod ] All right . I 'll take anything cold . Jarod ? Mike Bodie ? Would have been here sooner , but I had to stop at my place and grab something . God , you remind me of him . My father . Major Charles . That 's why I left the message on the Web site . You knew him . A dream catcher . Your father made it . There 's a part of him in that . Now it 's a part of you . All I have is this . A reflection . I can top that . - Is this my father ? - And me , 20 years ago . I thought you should have it . [ Groans ] You 've been shot . - That 's what happens when someone 's trying to kill you . - Who ? I 'm sorry , Jarod . I didn 't want it to come down like this . I can help you . I 'm the one that owes you . - Mike . - I want to tell you everything about your father ... and his dream quest . Mike ! Mike ! Damn . [ Panting ] [ Groans ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - What happened to Mr. Fenigor ? - [ Mr. Lyle ] He 's assumed room temperature . In a manner of speaking . - He 's dead ? - That 's what I 'm told . - What are you doing here ? - I wanted to hear from Fenigor himself ... thatJarod 's father killed our mother . Daddy told you ? Doesn 't matter . Too late now anyway . We 'll never know for sure . We will when I find Jarod 's father . Finding him - It 's not about catching Jarod , is it ? What 's it about ? Revenge ? - My mother deserves it . - She was our mother . What about our father ? I mean , have you thought about what opening these old wounds might do to him ? You know , the fact that you 're my sister doesn 't change one thing . You are beautiful when you 're angry . You 've never seen me angry . Ow . Damn bounty hunters - think they 're playing cowboys and Indians . - Bounty hunters ? - Yeah . What were they doing after Mike ? Bail jumping 's kind of a habit with Mike Bodie . Thinks he 's a modern-day Crazy Horse . Just wish he 'd stay on his own land instead of comin 'onto mine . - [ Shotgun Blast ] - [ Mike ] Hey . Hey . Don 't shoot ! - I 'm not armed ! Hey ! Look . No , no - - [ Shotgun Blasts ] Don 't shoot ! That 's what happens when someone 's trying to kill you . Hope you 're here to check the meter . Not today . Today I 'm just hunting a bounty . - Like you . - Is that right ? What 's your name ? Jarod ... Green . - I. D ? - The diploma 's out in theJeep . Are you going to shoot me ? Not if you stay out of my way . Looks like he left in a mighty hurry . Shotguns are a great motivator . They hit him over here , and then he jumped out that window . Seems you 've done this before . You got a name to go with that shotgun ? Kim ... Peace . Mike Bodie is some kind of activist . Terrorist is more like it . Blew up a mining rig . That 's why he 's worth 20K . My 20K . Hmm . Twenty grand . - Enough to share . - I don 't share bounties . How about coffee ? - [ Kim ] Where 'd you say you 're from ? - Delaware . Mmm . That 's a whole lot of hunters for one man . Twenty grand brings out the best and the brightest . Kimberly . Who 's your new friend ? More competition . - Jarod Green . - Dennis Beers . Looks like we 're after the same Injun . May the best man win . Bet ya a hundred bucks one of those poor excuses shot up Mike 's place . Maybe they 're after a dead skip . What makes you think they 're tryin ' to kill him ? Well , for starters , the bloodstains and the shotgun blasts . Scare tactics . These guys are not in the killing business . Worst case , Bodie 'll get roughed up . You didn 't rough me up . I 'm an old-fashioned girl . Now you - You 're kind of a riddle . No handcuffs . No gun . YourJeep 's a rental . And no wedding ring . I got a hunch you don 't have a place to call home . Well , I could say the same thing about you . Are you sure you won 't consider a team effort ? Thanks for the flapjacks , Delaware . Broots . How - How 'd you know it was me ? Too much Old Spice . [ Whispers ] You won 't believe what I snagged . [ Clears Throat ] Well , don 't let me stop you . Oh - Oh , you know that , uh - the Web site you wanted me to trace ? Well , uh , you know , it 's untraceable . Appears as ifJarod had programmed it ... - to jump to a different server every 18 hours . - So you haven 't found it ? No . Dead ends are Jarod 's specialty . Keep searching . For a while I thought I was gonna swallow my tongue . That 's all I could dig up on Fenigor . It 's a death certificate . They kept him alive for two extra days to harvest his organs . His kidneys are in Kansas . His liver 's in New York . His spleen 's in Spokane . - Get me a picture . - Of his spleen ? - His corpse . - You don 't believe the file . The only thing I believe is if Lyle brings in Jarod instead of me ... Fenigor won 't be the only supplier to the Organ of the Month Club . Parker , are you sure this isn 't about revenge againstJarod 's father ? Find me the old man 's body before there 's another one . - Sydney . - Ah . What if Lyle finds Jarod before Miss Parker ? - What would happen then ? - To her ? [ Whispers ] No . To us . [ Jarod ] I 'm a bounty hunter . Why do you need my name ? You know , the state may say you 've got jurisdiction , but this is my neighborhood ... and you don 't operate on these lands without registering . And I don 't appreciate no bounty hunter ... stormin ' through here like The Man With No Name . So , Bodie bombed a mining rig ? Well , A.C.M. ' s have been ... makin ' copper digs just outside the res . Mike didn 't want ' em near his property . His house is not on the reservation . Just outside . His land was parceled to his ancestors a hundred years ago . I have a picture of Mike as a little boy . Do you recognize the man with him ? You 're best to talk to Emery . He 's the history buff . Emery ! Yeah . You know this guy ? Mm-mmm . Sorry . Thank you . You 're not a bounty hunter . Mike 's dream catcher-You would 've had to kill him to take it off his neck . So he must have given it to you . You know Mike ? He 's part of my thesis on indigenous rights . Are you a descendant ? Not unless Tonto had a rabbi I don 't know about . Here . Some of my research on Mike and A.C.M. - Might help you track him down . - You think the company would try to kill him ? Well , it would shut up their loudest protestor . Thank you very much . Jarod , that picture - - Who is the older guy ? - Pretty sure he 's my father . - Pretty sure ? - When I was a boy , I - I was told that my parents were killed in a plane crash . It was a lie . Man . Who 'd make up a lie like that ? The Centre has another project for you , Jarod . This technique hasn 't been used for decades . How can you improve it ? By factoring in tissue depth from living people ... I can re-create a face more accurately . By size and weight , I - I would say he is a man . [ Young Sydney ] Very good . - Was he someone 's father ? - Jarod . Yesterday was a year , Sydney . - Since the crash . - Focus ... on the work . This technique is promising . I wish I could invent a way to bring him back . [ Mike ] I want to tell you everything about your father and his dream quest . [ Engine Starts ] [ Engine Starts ] You 're a bounty hunter ? Not anymore . - What happened at your house ? - Guy came in blasting . - Did you see him ? - He must have been waiting for me . As soon as he started shooting , I ran . But not before I grabbed that picture of your father . [ Groans ] That could be infected . I 'm staying in a motel up the highway . Let 's get you there , and I 'll fix you up . Come on . That 's not right . I owe you . - Why do you keep saying that ? - Your father saved my life . I need to tell you about him and his dream quest . You want answers ? Jarod , I got ' em . Come on . - Freeze ! - Kim , no ! Two words , Jarod ! " Hand cuffs " ! You are so focused on the money , you don 't even care that the man is injured ! Doesn 't look that hurt to me . - I think a bounty hunter is tryin ' to kill him . - Tell it to the judge . If he lives that long . Where 'd you get that ? Gift shop up the highway . [ Jarod On Phone ] After three years of searching , I finally feel close . What about Fenigor 's last words ? Your father may be a killer . Is that something you can accept ? Unless it 's another Centre lie . Has any of your eyesight returned since the bombing ? Infirmary says , uh , there 's no nerve damage , but I still can 't see . Maybe you don 't want to . I don 't know who I am ... or where I came from ... or if my father murdered a woman in cold blood ... but I 'll take what I can get . Truth isn 't easy ... but it 's real . - It opens your eyes . - [ Beep ] [ Dial Tone , Beeps ] I ask for Fenigor 's body , you bring his sheets ? It was either that or a bedpan . Perhaps Angelo 's empathic abilities ... - can give us some direction . - The blind leading the blind . Revenge bad . Revenge makes revenge makes revenge . This isn 't about me . Mr. F-Fenigor better now . Is he alive ? Where is he ? What 's going on , Broots ? - What is Angelo up to ? - [ Broots ] Well , he 's , uh ... put the sheet over his head . [ Sydney ] Fenigor is a ghost . Ghosts aren 't alive , Sydney . At the Centre they are . And where do they live these days ? Renewal Wing . " C , " " A " ... . five , four , three . " C , " " A " ... . - five , four , three . - " C , " " A " ... five , four , three . [ Sydney ] Thank you , Angelo . It must be bounty hunter breakfast break . A man 's gotta eat , Vincent . I never start a day without pigs in a blanket . - Pigs in the who ? - Blanket . Have a nice day . The bartender at Dunson 's ... told me Mike was there yesterday . Said a bounty hunter showed up and shot the place up . Is that so ? - Said Mike was shot too . - Really ? I wouldn 't put it past you animals . From what I hear , it 's the mining company that wants Mike dead . Well , you just tell your friends this ain 't the Wild West . That 's why I got paperwork on you people . These are all the registered bounty hunters ? Yes . Please don 't tell Vincent about this . He 'd kill me . It 's between us . Jarod , I was thinking about that picture of your dad . I scoped out back issues of the tribal paper . This is from the mid - ' 70s . Mike was lost in the desert , so they mounted this huge rescue effort . The find was credited to an ex-air force major who volunteered for the search . - Is his name in here anywhere ? - No , but he saved Mike 's life . Why are you doing this ? You know , every man should know who his father is . [ Young Sydney ] Your facial reconstruction techniques are quite impressive , Jarod . - What 's that ? - My father . I sculpted him too , Sydney . - [ Young Sydney ] He doesn 't have a face . - I can 't see my father , Sydney . I don 't know who he really is . [ Whispers ] Oh , you 're gonna get shot creepin ' around like that ! You think I want to be down here ? Angelo started mumbling something after you left . Something about CA543 . - Centre Archives ? - Yes . It 's a reference number for an archive receptacle . [ Motor Whirring ] Lost . Nice pajamas . If Angelo says there 's something in the archives , go get it . [ Humming ] - [ Miss Parker ] Broots . - [ Humming Continues ] So nice to have visitors . Mr. Fenigor . - Dad ? - Dad ? Is that you ? Is that you ? I can 't see my father , Sydney . I don 't know who he really is . [ Screams ] [ Banging ] [ Groaning ] You said motel by the highway . - Hard man to find . - Mike . - [ Groaning ] - Mike . [ Miss Parker ] Don 't you remember me ? - Can 't say that I do . - Mr. Fenigor , my mother is Catherine Parker . - Who ? - You were helping her ... rescue children from the Centre . Rescue ? The Centre 's mission statement clearly says ... that our fellow man is our highest priority . Jarod 's father killed my mother . That 's what you said . I don 't know anyJarod . Sorry . I hope you find what you 're looking for . - Somebody scrambled his brain . - Like an egg . Huh . Why wouldn 't they just kill him ? - I mean , they did it to - - To my mother ? Okay . L - It 's a really bad analogy , but think about it . I mean , why wouldn 't they just get rid of him ? Maybe somebody wants me down here looking for Fenigor , running into dead ends . - Mr. Lyle . - It would give him a jump start on catching Jarod . Does he know about this archive receptacle ? - No . Angelo only told me and Sydney . - Find it , and bring it to me . Buckshot . You 're lucky . I didn 't bomb that mining rig . Then why did you jump bail ? Do you know - Do you know how many times A.C.M. ' s had me arrested ? I always skip a court appearance just to get theirJockeys in a bunch . Gotta be vocal , defend my land . I 'm the last in my line , Jarod . I die , the tribe gets it . Cute . Why don 't you take me in ? I 'm a valuable warrior . I 'll take my past instead . [ Banging ] I knew that dream catcher looked familiar . I played a hunch , Delaware . I figured if I followed you instead of Mike , he 'd show up . Good hunch . - [ Groans ] - You can 't just take him in . Yes , I can . [ Grunts ] - No , you can 't . - Ow ! Two words : " hand cuffs . " Every bounty hunter in the state will be after us now . I 'm better when I 'm hunted . Hey ! That 's my ... car . [ Miss Parker ] Anything on theJarod Web site front ? Just that you were right . It was a dead end . Oh , if anything comes up , you 'll be the first to know . - I 'm sure I will . - Any luck on the revenge front ? You too will be the first to know . Where 's Helen Keller ? Physician , heal thyself ? Therapy , Miss Parker . Face the truth about what you 've done . In my case , misguided vengeance . Turn your eyes to something positive ... something worth seeing . Does it work ? You 're blurry . But you 're there . Do you think my revenge is misguided ? If you have to ask ... you 're answering your own question . No offense , Syd , but you can 't see it from where I stand . But I don 't have to . I 've known you since you were a little girl , Parker . You will never let this go . But I want to help . Like him . You 're worth it . Where 's my mom and dad ? [ Mike ] You 're a good man , Jarod . - Just like your father . - What was he like ? He would only say his name was Major Charles . But I gave him a better one . Soaring Eagle . - Did he live around here ? - No . He trained at Clearview Air Base years before . So he knew the terrain . Just like he knew about losing a son . I heard about the search for you when you were a boy . I wanted to be a big warrior , go on a quest . I wandered into the caves and broke my arm . Your dad led the search for me . After five days they stopped lookin ' , but your father - He wouldn 't give up . My father kept on searching . Alone . He said it was like finding his own son . Like finding you . As a reward , my father taught yours to make his own dream catcher ... sent him to the caves on his own quest . Is the cave still out there ? Just like he left it . They say you can find things there . Answers to questions that are in here . - That 's what he did . - [ Shotgun Blasts ] Get down ! - Are you hit ? - Yeah , but I 'm not bleeding . - Rubber bullets . - That cowboy 's not so tough . Or he wasn 't hired to kill you . I found it , Miss Parker , but I don 't know what it means . Why would they have an archive receptacle on your mom ? L - I didn 't - I mean , I couldn 't . I wouldn 't open it . It 's , um - Well , it 's not my place . I 'm leaving . Here I go . I 'm leaving . Here I go . - Broots . - Yeah . Thanks . Mama ! Mama , please , no ! Mama ! [ Lid Closes ] [ Jarod ] If the bounty hunters don 't want you dead , then somebody else does . The question is why . All of this land was sold to the mining company by the tribe ? Except my land . They don 't own it . - But if you die , the tribe gets your land . - Doesn 't make sense . If the tribe sells my land , who benefits ? The man who makes it happen . - Vincent . - As tribal liaison ... he arranges land buys for A.C.M. Vincent 's stock portfolio . After every land deal , he gets more stock options . Couldn 't sell your land , and he can 't cash in the options until he completes the pie . Guess killing you is the only answer . The bounty hunters take the blame . How much ? [ Keyboard Clacking ] [ Jarod ] $ 250,000 . Talk about making a killing . Jarod . That 's a mighty big gun you 've got . Don 't leave home without it . I 'll have to remember that . [ Mimics Gunshot ] - [ Mimics Gunshot ] - [ Jarod ] Kim . It 's Delaware . I 've got something to show you . [ Rings ] - Yeah . - I 've gotta talk to you , Vincent . - What the hell is it ? I 'm eating . - Sorry . Listen . I was working late , and Mike Bodie showed up . He 's furious . He 's looking at maps and computer files and stuff . L - I 'll be right over . [ Electronic Twittering ] [ Keyboard Clacking ] - Damn it ! - [ Hammer Cocks ] Aw . Your money 's all gone . Better call your broker . The Man With No Name . Were you expecting someone else ? Mike Bodie maybe ? Well , I 'm just guessing , of course . Takin ' a shot in the dark . [ Vincent Panting ] [ Grunting ] How 's it feel , Vincent ? To be unarmed . - What the hell are you doin ' ? - I 'm goin ' huntin ' ! What about you ? You got the wrong bounty ! Oh , you should know , 'cause you were a bounty hunter ... the night you tried to kill Mike Bodie ! Mike jumped bail ! On what charge ? Blowing up an A.C.M. Rig ? It was empty , Vincent . And I 'll bet your stock options that you set the explosion yourself . You had to have Mike 's land . And you knew he had a habit ofjumpin 'bail . So you tried to gun him down . And you figured that the bounty hunters would take the blame . You sold out your own people . That 's right , Jarod . And I blew up the rig . And I tried to kill Mike . And now you 're out of shells , cowboy . [ Click ] And you 're out ofluck . Knew we 'd make a great team . Whose gun is this , Angelo ? Circle . Follow the circle . Follow the circle . But to where , Angelo ? Mr. Lyle 's on his way with your father . Sydney , you can see ? Better , Miss Parker . Thanks for the heads-up . [ Door Opens ] Daddy . Angel . Now listen . About the other day - I have decided to take your advice and put Mother 's death behind me . Let 's getJarod , not his father . Couldn 't have put it better myself . That 's what I call a family conference . - I 'm glad for you . - It 's time to let the past be the past . [ Angelo 's Voice ] Circle . Follow the circle . [ Mike ] To perform the dream quest ... you 've got to go to a sacred place ... where all the questions inside your heart can be answered . This is where your father went . Lead the way . I was told something about my father . Something evil . What kind of man was he ? He saved my life . [ Mike ] Your father 's . No one has been in this cave since he left . - What are these ? - Visions from your father 's quest . The eagle . It 's always above us . Always searching . This eagle is searching for his son . Our symbol for eternity . He will never give up his search . These are my father 's dreams . [ Mike ] Or nightmares . Circle of fire . - What do you think it means ? - Ask him yourself . You 're on your own . [ Man Chanting In Native Language ] [ Continues ] [ Jarod , Echoing ] Dad ? - Dad ? - Dad ? Is that you ? Is that you ? I knew you 'd never stop searching . There 's something I need to know . Did you kill Catherine Parker ? Follow the circle , Jarod . Follow the circle . [ Jarod 's Voice ] Dad , did you kill Catherine Parker ? [ Major Charles ] Follow the circle , Jarod . Follow the circle . [ Mike ] The elders think the patch was from your father 's squadron here at Clearview . Unfortunately , they closed the base down over 20 years ago . - Dead end . - The story of my life . But you can 't have a dead end without a road . And thanks to you , I have a new one to follow . - So , what are you gonna do ? - I 'm going to follow the circle .

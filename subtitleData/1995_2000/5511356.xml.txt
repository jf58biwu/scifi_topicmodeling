 - Do you remember what I told you ? Do you remember ? - Just a little bit of help . I warned you to stay clear of this place . I 'll do anything that you need done . I just need something to eat . Not for me - for my child . I told you . This isn 't a halfway house . - Is there a problem here , Manny ? - Oh , I didn 't see you , Mrs. - [ Woman ] Is this man disrupting business ? Well , he keeps coming in asking if there 's any work . - Give him my table . - Excuse me ? - Treat him and his family the same as any other patron . - But , Mrs. - When his family has finished eating , pack a picnic basket ... and give them enough cash for a hotel room for a week . - Do you have a problem with that ? - No , ma 'am . - It 's all right to go get your family now . - God bless you . Dignity is usually something you see taken ... not given . Family is the most important thing a person can protect . It 's all there is . You 're not from Clear Bay . No , I 'm-I 'm not . Pleasure trip ? Business . Well , I hope you enjoy your stay . I , uh - I didn 't get your name . Your résumé is impressive . - Flawed , but impressive . - Flawed ? The job you did in Seattle almost landed you in jail . Well , I 'm here , aren 't I ? Mr. Kincade needs a consummate professional . If he is even slightly associated with incendiary events ... other arrangements will have to be made . - Try English . - How do we know you 're any good ? You see that 18-footer at the end of the dock ? - Yes . - It belongs to the local sheriff , I believe . Yes . Randall Carver . That 's him over there . - He lives for that boat . - Not anymore . [ Explosion ] That 's my-That 's my boat ! [ People Screaming , Gasping ] So , we in business ? [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Miss Parker ] Hello ? Anybody here ? [ Sniffles ] Miss Parker . - What 's going on ? - I was just , uh , catching up on the pursuit files . I guess I 'll ... get back to work . Excuse me . - Here it comes . Here it comes . - [ Groaning ] The second child is a boy . It 's stillborn . Harold Kincade . Thanks for coming , Mr. Burns . The Venus butterfly . They say if she lands on you ... some crap about good luck . Well , luck didn 't help this one very much . You got that right . I heard about your show at the marina this morning . - Fourth ofJuly stuff . - Well , Sheriff Carver 's not celebrating . The preliminary investigation ruled the explosion accidental . That 's the idea . Clean , professional . I wouldn 't want anything to happen like what happened last time . Last time ? I read the papers . I know all about how those people died in your building . It was an amateurish job . Just the kind of mess I don 't need . [ Woman ] Harold ? [ Kincade ] I thought you were spending the afternoon in town . I wanted to surprise you . I had Doris fix us an early dinner . - No time . - Well , I 'm sure she can - Manny told me you created quite a scene this morning with a homeless man . It was more than just a homeless man . He had a little girl who looked like she hadn 't had a decent meal in weeks . My wife 's a sucker for the lazy and unmotivated , Mr. Burns . Jarod . Jarod 's a designer . I thought I 'd give him a shot at the building downtown . Could you recommend a place to stay ? I 'm afraid it 's peak season . There 's not gonna be much available in town . Well , the guesthouse is empty . I couldn 't possibly put anybody out . My husband is a sucker for the aggressive and industrious . I 'll have the housekeeper open it for you . We 'll talk in the morning . Don 't wait up . [ Miss Parker ] I swear he was crying . He was watching his own birth , Parker . Seeing yourself ripped away from family is enough to tear anyone 's heart out . Since when does Lyle have a heart ? Why is it so hard for you to believe he might actually feel loss ? After all , Catherine was his mother too . She may have given him life , but she had nothing to do with who he is . People change , Parker . Call it an awakening . Sydney , we 're talking about a man who killed in cold blood . - You don 't " awaken " from that . - [ Door Opens ] Miss Parker , this was just delivered for you . Looks likeJarod 's handwriting . [ Broots ] Oh , she 's pretty . " Trust can kill you or set you free . " I 've heard that somewhere before . It sounds kind of cryptic . Jarod wouldn 't have sent this without a reason . Find out who she is . Sure . [ Jarod ] I grew up a long way away from here . - That makes two of us . - Really ? I imagined you as a little girl with a pony and private schools ... leading this charmed life like Alice in Wonderland . My parents died in a fire when I was a baby . I was raised by my aunt in a little trailer park just west of Corpus Christi . That must have been very difficult for you . She loved me . That 's the last time I remember being truly happy . And you ? Do you have family ? I have a sister out there somewhere . - My brother was killed about six months ago . - I 'm sorry . - Your parents ? - I lost contact with them when I was a child . I 'm still trying to find them . You should never give up . The thing you want most in life could be right around the next corner . I know you 're not who you pretend to be . I used to deny it , but I know what my husband does . You 're not here to design a building . You 're here to burn one down . That 's not ... really who I am . I believe you , Jarod . You 're a good man . I can see it in your eyes . My husband used to be a good man . Unfortunately , people change . Good night . Good night . - Daddy ? - Ah , angel . Did you , um , change your hair again ? Do you like it ? Well , it 's your head . [ Chuckles ] Daddy , I need to talk to you about Lyle . I don 't mean to sound paranoid , but I think he 's up to something . - Did he threaten you ? - Threaten ? No . I caught him watching the D.S.A. Of my - of-of our birth . - So ? - So , he was crying . Ah , I see . Crying . And you took that for hostility ? Well , no . But given his track record ... I thought it was kind of strange . Now , sweetheart , Lyle 's a very deep and complicated man . - But , Daddy - - No , let me finish . He came to me a few days ago in confidence and , uh , purged his soul . I think you could say he 's , uh , undergoing a transformation . You know , he wanted to know the location of your mother 's grave . Can you imagine that ? Hmm . No , I can 't . Sweetheart , I know it 's hard for you ... finding out about your brother the way you did . But it isn 't easy for him either , you know . Just remember that . And I do love your hair . [ Jarod On Phone ] " Trust can kill you or set you free . " So I 've read . Who 's the woman in the picture ? [ Jarod ] Someone who got caught up with the wrong people . [ Miss Parker ] Haven 't we all ? Some do worse things than others . Like murdering an innocent woman in an elevator ? So what are you trying to tell me ? That you have to see people for what they are . - Keep my eyes open . - To all possibilities . Because in the end ... we all get what we deserve . [ Flames Crackling ] [ Flames Crackling ] [ Kristi Screaming ] Oh , my God ! Jarod , help ! It 's Harold ! - Kristi , what happened ? - There was an explosion . A fire . I couldn 't get to him . - Where 's your husband ? - In the bedroom . Call 911 ! - Stay here . - He 's my husband ! Stay here ! [ Woman On Radio ] Truck 89 , tanker truck 289 . 289 , do you copy ? - Make sure the fire inspector has complete access to the bedroom . - Right . - Tape off the balcony . - They still haven 't found the source of the fire . Sounds like my boat . What a mess . Are you sure you wouldn 't rather lie down ? I 'm sorry to bother you , Ms. Kincade , but I need to ask you some questions . - Can 't this wait ? - You the lawyer ? - Tom Byner 's my lawyer . He 's on his way . - I see . You wanna wait for him , or do you wanna talk to me about this thing ? - What are you getting at , Sheriff ? - Who are you ? Mr. Burns is a business associate of my husband . He 's our guest . - What do you wanna know ? - Everything you can remember . I , uh , went to bed around 10 : 00 . Harold wasn 't home yet . He had a business meeting . Um , I 'd fallen asleep . I remember Harold climbing into bed . I don 't know what time it was or how long it had been . What happened next ? It 's okay . [ Kristi ] Um , I rolled over away from Harold ... and I fell back asleep . And at some point , everything exploded . I heard Harold scream , and I turned , and he was on fire . I reached out for him , but the flames were too hot . There was nothing I could do . So I ran down the stairs , and I found Doris our housekeeper ... and that 's when she told me what she saw . - What ? - A-A figure . A man running across the lawn into the woods . That 's all I remember . I 'm gonna have to ask you to come back into town with me , Miss Kincade . - What ? Are you arresting her ? - No . - If everything checks out , she oughta be home by morning . - Sheriff , this is ridiculous . - She 's been through enough already . - Mr. Burns . The housekeeper 's statement takes you away from the scene of the fire . But , uh , I would appreciate it if you didn 't leave town right away . - Beautiful girl . - Mmm . Her name is Che Ling . That 's what it says right here . She 's from the Xinjiang province , one of the poorest regions of Northern China . - Cut to the chase , Broots . - Okay . She applied for a visa 24 months ago . She received it a year later . - And that 's when she landed in neon city . - Vegas ? - Mm-hmm . - Ring-a-ding-ding . Yes . Las Vegas is the marriage capital of the world . - Marriage ? - Mm-hmm . - See , Che Ling is a mail-order bride . - [ Sighs ] Keep digging . L. V.P.D. , county marriage records . - I want this girl . - Okay . Men ordering women like they were snow tires . Well , I 'll give you a call later . - You gonna be all right ? - Yes . - Hi . - Hi . Thank you for coming . - Did Carver put you through the ringer ? - I 've had better nights . But I think he 's satisfied , at least for now . I had your housekeeper prepare a spare bedroom , so you can get some rest . I can 't go back to that house . Not yet . Well , where can I take you ? We have a cabin just outside of town . - Do you think you could drive me there ? - Of course . Come on . [ Kristi ] Harold and I used to love this place ... especially in the early years . I don 't wanna sound disrespectful ... but your husband didn 't seem to treat you very well . He used to . The man I loved and married was caring and compassionate . He just didn 't stay that way . Kristi , there 's something I wanna tell you . The real reason that I came to Clear Bay was - [ Sniffing ] - What is it ? - I think you have a cracked line . Harold never could get that gas leak fixed . It seemed like every time the gas company came out to fix one break ... another one would spring up . I can shut off the main outside , but you should really - really have that replaced . [ Phone Ringing ] Hello ? Yes . Yes , she is . It 's Tom Byner . Thank you . Yes ? No , Tom , I don 't wanna talk about this . No , I 'll call you . - What 's wrong ? - Byner wants to go over Harold 's will . - Now ? - Something about tax complications . I don 't know if I can deal with this . I 'm scared , Jarod . I can tell that the police think that I had something to do with Harold 's death . - Why you ? - The estate is worth millions . Your housekeeper saw someone running from the house , right ? - What if they don 't believe her ? - I 'll make them believe her . I 'll prove to them that someone else was there . Okay ? It 's been so long since someone 's really taken care of me . I 'm - I 'm so sorry . - It 's okay . - No , it 's - It 's okay . I 'm sorry . It 's strange to say good-bye to someone you 've never met . You can spend every waking hour ... working your way to the top , and then you get there ... and you realize that 's not even what it 's all about . Are you talking about her ? No . Me . I 've made a lot of mistakes along the way . I 've made excuses for everything I 've done , and ... I can 't - I won 't blame my past anymore . I can 't move forward without a clean slate . [ Miss Parker ] She was very compassionate . I was never allowed a first chance with her ... but I 'd like a second one with you . [ Woman ] Where did it all go wrong ? Who are you , Mr. Burns ? I already told you . I 'm a designer . And I 'm Cindy Crawford . The only thing that I 'm guilty of is bad timing . - I doubt Mrs. Kincade would agree with that . - Meaning ? She seems relieved to have someone like you to lean on . Mrs. Kincade is a very nice woman . She 's the prime suspect in an active murder investigation . She had nothing to do with the death of her husband . Maybe she didn 't . Maybe she did . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd leave the investigation to the police . - A case like this could really make a cop 's career . - What did you say ? I 'm wondering what you 're really interested in - justice or a conviction . I 'm interested in the truth . And we 'll find it . [ Kristi 's Voice ] Our housekeeper told me what she saw . A man running across the lawn into the woods . They say the killer always returns to the scene of the crime . It 's times like this I wish I hadn 't quit smoking . What 's really bothering you ? Lyle is my brother , and he seems sincere . Oh , Sydney , I want to trust him . It 's just - " Trust can kill you or set you free . " I remember who first said that to me now . - Confucius ? - Your mother . I just got this from the Las Vegas Police Department . It 's a 911 Che Ling made the night she disappeared . - Play it . - [ Woman ] 911 . [ Che Ling ] You have to help me . He will hurt me . - Slow down . What 's the problem ? - He angry . He always angry . Going to hit me , beat me . He coming back . - Who is " he " ? Your husband ? Boyfriend ? - He coming . - Where are you ? - 223 Desert Vista Apartments . - Please , he going to kill me . - [ Thud , Glass Breaking ] When the police got there , the apartment was empty . - Mail-order husband ? - Vanished . So was everything connecting him to her . What about a marriage certificate ? There must be some way to find out who she was so afraid of . I contacted the license bureau . They couldn 't find any record of anyone named Che Ling . It seems like everything about her is disappearing right in front of our eyes . This was just delivered for you , Miss Parker . Another present from Jarod . [ Broots ] Isn 't that your father ? - [ Tape Rewinding ] - [ Woman ] Where are you ? [ Che Ling ] 223 Desert Vista Apartments . Please , he going to kill me . Desert Vista Apartments . You don 't think it was your father that Che Ling was so afraid of , do you ? Where are you going ? To try and find someone to trust . You wanna tell me again why you came to Clear Bay ? I was on retainer to do some work for Harold Kincade . Mm-hmm . Like the work you did in Seattle a few years back ? I did a background check on you , Burns . You got a half a dozen arrests ... for arson . I got a dead man , a suspicious fire and a whole lot of attitude ... and it doesn 't take a genius to figure it out . - Now why did you kill Kincade ? - I didn 't . - You were on the grounds . - What about the boot prints ? - They 're not my size . - Easy for you to plant . No , I want them labeled as evidence . Did Kincade cross you on the deal ? Try to rip you off ? Is that why you torched him ? - Answer me ! - I 'm not saying anything . Which puts you right at the top of the list in the murder of Harold Kincade . - Not unless you have more than a suspect rap sheet . - Oh , gee . - Tom , go away . This is police business . - Not anymore , it isn 't . I 've been retained by Kristi Kincade to represent Mr. Burns in this matter . - Kristi sent you ? - If you have proof of Mr. Burns 's guilt , charge him . Otherwise , I suggest you arrange for his immediate release . Sheriff ? What did Burns mean when he asked about the boot prints ? You watched my interrogation ? I thought I could learn something . Sheriff , you got a phone call . They say it 's an emergency . Look , Deputy , why don 't you get back out on patrol , huh ? We don 't want the system to break down now , do we ? Hello ? Hello ? Jarod ! I was so worried . Oh ! When I heard you 'd been taken in by Sheriff Carver , I thought that - It 's okay now . Everything 's okay . It 's like a bad dream . I 'm here now . [ Clears Throat ] Yes , Doris ? Excuse me , Mrs. Kincade . I think there 's something you should see . Will you excuse me ? Is everything all right ? I believed in you . I thought I 'd finally found someone who I could trust . What are you talking about ? - Lighter fluid , fuses , a timer . - Where did you get this ? Did you think that killing him was the only way for us to be together ? What ? I had nothing to do with the death of your husband . - Then explain why Doris found all this in the guest room . - I don 't know . I trusted you ! - Wait , wait , wait . - Don 't - Let me go ! Not until you listen to me ! Now listen to me ! Yes , I wanted to see your husband punished . But after I met you , everything changed . I had nothing to do with the death of your husband . I could never do anything like that ... especially to someone like you . You have to believe me . [ Siren Wailing ] Doris . She called the sheriff . You gotta run . - I 've done nothing wrong . - Carver has information about you that says otherwise . You gotta go . Go to the cabin . Wait for me until I come for you . I 'll call Byner and see what we can do . All right . I 'm innocent . You have to believe me . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - Can we talk ? - Nothing would make me happier . There are things I need to share with you . I found a photograph . I 'm not sure what it means . - Photograph ? - A picture of - - Miss-Miss Parker ? - Not now . I 'm not sure what it means , but I think it concerns us both . It 's imperative we speak now , Miss Parker . Excuse me . What do you want ? We spoke to the sheriff outside ofTahoe . He recognized the picture of Che Ling I put on the Internet . - So ? - So she was found three days after that 911 call . She 'd been beaten to death and dumped near the highway . No one claimed the body . She was buried in a pauper 's grave . Are you telling me my father secretly married a mail-order bride and then killed her ? - No , not exactly . - The marriage records were erased , of course . But Broots found this wedding photo in the back issue of a Vegas newspaper . Son of a bitch . [ Sniffing ] [ Gas Hissing ] [ Beeping ] Harold never could get that gas leak fixed . Burns ! I know you 're in here . Now let 's just end this without anybody gettin ' hurt . - Change of heart ? - Jarod ! Was this your idea of protecting me ? What ? No ! No , you don 't understand . I talked to Sheriff Carver . - He 's on our side . - He 's on our side ? - Yes . - Then why did he have his gun drawn ? He wants to talk to you . That 's all . I explained everything to him . I told him you never could have done this . Please , just go in and talk to him , okay ? Okay . I want this to be over . I know you do . Jarod ? I love you . Angel . We need to talk . - You look like you just saw a ghost . - More like the grim reaper . Oh , I came this close to dropping my guard . Tears for Mom , trust , second chances . Something she never got . - I 'm glad it 's out in the open . - Then you admit knowing her ? Of course he knew her . He was married to her , for Pete 's sake . Daddy , you 're aware of all this ? I told you he confided in me . [ Chuckles ] You went to Las Vegas . I have a picture of you outside Che Ling 's apartment building . He was kind enough to help me tie up some loose ends . You mean cover up a murder , don 't you ? That 's way out ofline . I was afraid ... that 's what might have happened to her . Like you didn 't know ? I had nothing to do with Che Ling 's death . I loved her ! Then why all the secrets ? Couples have problems . I came home one day , and she was gone . She took off with some drifter type , I heard . Hey , she left because you hit her . - You see ? - Never touched her . - How do you know ? - ' Cause he said he didn 't . Now , everybody makes mistakes . At least you can give him another chance . I won 't try to justify everything that happened . But I 'm not the same person that I was . I 've changed ... and I hope that someday you 'll understand that ... embrace it . This whole deal isn 't worth the powder to blow it to hell . I mean , we 're a family . It 's about time we started acting like one . Now I 'm gonna demand that we all go out to dinner together tonight . Huh ? If you can 't trust your family , who can you trust ? The small bag stays with me . Make sure the trunks are sent ahead to the airport . I wish you 'd postpone this trip . - Harold 's will is watertight . That 's what you said . - He 's been dead less than a week . Yesterday , Burns and Carver were blown to bits in a cabin owned by you . It might look better if you didn 't appear so anxious to get out of town . Let me tell you something , counselor . Jarod Burns murdered my husband and then killed Sheriff Carver to cover his tracks . It 's just my good fortune that he screwed up and killed himself . I 'm on the flight to Paris in two hours . Do you have all the bank information ? The money will be wired to Paris by the end of the week . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Yeah . Are you sure ? - Can 't it be sent ahead to Paris ? - What 's wrong ? It appears there 's an addendum to Harold 's original will . - Meaning ? - Without your signature , you 'll forfeit a sum of money . - How much ? - $ 50,000 . But considering the inheritance is nearly 10 million ... I don 't think it 's anything you need to worry about . I don 't pay you to think . Switch my flight to midnight and have your assistant bring me those papers before I leave . - But what about - - Just do it ! Good afternoon , Mrs. Kincade ! - Who the hell are you ? - You helped me the other day at your restaurant ? What are you doing here ? My little girl wanted to thank you . And we wanted to say how sorry we were for the loss of your husband . What are you people doing on my property ? This is a private residence . The deputy let us in the front gate . - The deputy ? - I hope we 're not interrupting . - [ Glass Breaking ] - I saw you die . You should have taken your original flight , Kristi . But then again , I knew a girl like you couldn 't give up $ 50,000 . - Jarod . - Maybe you 'd better sit down . You look a little weak in the knees . I saw you walk into the cabin . I saw - No , you saw what you wanted to see . What you didn 't see was Sheriff Carver and me go out the back door ... before your homemade bomb blew it to bits . Oh , Sheriff Carver , he confessed to the murder of your husband ... and he implicated you in the whole thing . - Jarod - - It was a brilliant plan . Really . I mean , you had all the bases covered . I mean , what better partner in a murder than the man who was covering the investigation ? And you both played your parts brilliantly . I 'm sorry to bother you , Ms. Kincade , but I need to ask you some questions . He was on fire . Let 's go , Sheriff . Oh , and then there were the subtle touches . Your tears were so convincing the night you murdered your husband . - Stay here . - He 's my husband ! Stay here ! Routine maintenance calls to the gas company about that pesky leak ... before the " accidental " explosion . The only thing that was missing was a patsy - a fall guy to come along and pin the whole thing on . I love you . [ Echoing ] - Jarod , it was never personal . - Oh , you 're wrong . It was very personal . [ Handcuffs Clicking ] You know , there is one thing that I still can 't figure out . What 's that ? Whatever happened to that happy little girl from Corpus Christi ? [ Phone Ringing ] [ Phone Ringing ] - What ? - [ Jarod ] I assume you found Che Ling . I found her . She was in the county cemetery with a wooden grave marker . Another casualty of the Centre . [ Miss Parker ] Not according to Mr. Lyle and my father . And you think you can trust what they say ? As opposed to trusting you ? That 's kind of like jumping out of the fire into the fire , isn 't it ? You think you know the truth about your father ... and Mr. Lyle and who killed your mother . But the fact is , you only know what the Centre wants you to know . What do you want from me ? The same thing you want from me - a little trust . - I have to go . - Be careful , Miss Parker . Remember what your mother used to say - " Trust can kill you or set you free . " Ah , there 's my angel . Sweetheart , you are beautiful . - Let 's get a move on . - Where 's Lyle ? Oh , he called . He 's gonna meet us there . He said he didn 't want another minute to go by ... without arranging a proper burial for Che Ling . [ Clears Throat ] I 'll get the car . - Daddy - - Uh-huh ? You look very handsome tonight . You betcha .

 Whatever she wants us for , it better be good . Bridge . I had you right where I wanted you . What are you talking about ? I was ahead- - 19-7 . I was just lulling you into a false sense of security . Sure you were . I 'll win the next couple of points , then you 'll start to tense up . I do not tense up . Easy , B 'Elanna . It 's only hoverball . You wanted to see us , Captain ? Yes , Commander . We 've picked up an intriguing transmission . I have a source on the signal . A ship ? Negative . It appears to be a beacon of some kind . A beacon ? We are being hailed by someone using a Federation signal . How could someone be transmitting a Federation signal from the Delta Quadrant ? Maybe Starfleet found a way to get a probe here . Maybe they 're looking for us . I 'd like to believe that , too , but let 's not jump to conclusions . See if you can authenticate the signal . The carrier wave frequency does correspond to standard Starfleet security codes . As of when ? According to the encryption key , this particular code was not scheduled for implementation until Stardate 48423 . That 's a month after we left Deep Space 9 . They must be looking for us . Your optimism may be premature , Mr. Kim . Sorry , Captain . But it 's also infectious . Mr. Paris , lay in a course for the beacon . Yes , ma 'am . We 're approaching the beacon 's coordinates , Captain . It 's drifted inside an ionized hydrogen cloud . The cloud 's interfering with our sensor readings . Can you get any information from the beacon ? I 'm afraid not . Should I beam it aboard ? I 'd advise against bringing it on board before we 've gotten a look at it- - even if it is emitting a Federation signal . Agreed , and I don 't want to fly blindly into a hydrogen cloud either . Mr. Tuvok , tractor the probe into sensor range . Aye , Captain . Targeting scanners locked . Initiating tractor beam . Report . We are taking fire from inside the cloud . Source ? Unknown . Battle stations . A Kazon raider is closing at 158 mark 9 . Hail them , Mr. Kim . They 're not responding , Captain . Warp 3 , Mr. Paris . Get us out of here . Aye ... Warp engines are off-line , Captain . Initiate evasive pattern omega three . Mr. Tuvok , return fire . Aye , Captain . Kazon ship is in pursuit . An opening is forming in the starboard shields , 72 centimeters in diameter . See if you can close it , Commander . Try rotating the shield harmonics . They are continuously matching their weapons frequency to our shield frequency . How the hell can they do that ? I don 't know . The diameter of the opening has widened to approximately two meters . Set the shield harmonics to rotate continuously . Aye , Commander . The diameter of the opening is now approximately four meters . It 's as if they know our access codes . Captain , I am picking up a smaller vessel emerging from the hydrogen cloud . It is heading directly toward the opening in our shields . All hands , brace for impact . Warning . Hull breach on Deck 4 , Cargo Bay 2 . Structural integrity is at 50 percent and dropping . The hull is starting to buckle . We 're losing life support on Deck 4 . I am trying to initiate an emergency containment field . However , the collision has caused a power failure on Deck 4 . Rerouting power to compensate . Containment field activated . Warning . Intruder alert in Cargo Bay 2 . Mr. Tuvok ! Tuvok to Security . Meet me outside Cargo Bay 2 . Aye , sir . Drop your weapons ! It 's no use . We 're not going anywhere with that shuttle sticking out of our side . It 's totally destabilizing our warp field . Mr. Kim , did you reroute power to Transporter Room 2 ? No , sir . Bridge to Tuvok . Tuvok here . There may be intruders in Transporter Room 2 . I 'm on my way . Tuvok to Bridge . Go ahead . The Kazon have beamed away , Captain , and they 've taken one of our transporter modules with them . Can you lock on to the module and beam it back ? Not at the moment . As soon as the Kazon dematerialized , we lost all transporter power . Mr. Chakotay , lock a tractor beam on to their ship . They 're not leaving with that module . Aye , Captain . The Kazon are powering their warp engines , Captain . Make it fast , Commander . Engaging tractor beam . I 've got them , Captain . The Kazon ship is hailing us . Suddenly they want to talk . On screen . Captain Janeway . First Maje Culluh of the Kazon-Nistrim . I remember you , Culluh . That transporter module you just stole is specifically designed for our ship . You 'll never be able to integrate it into your systems . I 've had some help updating our technology since we last met . Seska ? That 's right , Captain . As you can see , I 'm in the process of restoring my Cardassian physiology . Hello , Chakotay . I should have known you were involved . Yes , you should have . Just like I knew you 'd try to stop us with a tractor beam . You 've always been so predictable . Captain , their deflector shields are creating a feedback loop . It 's neutralizing the tractor emitter . Attempting to compensate . Good-bye , Chakotay . Lovely to see you again . It 's too late . They 've gone to warp . They modified the bow to puncture our hull . I 've never seen the Kazon do anything like this before . Until now , the Kazon have never had an advisor with Cardassian , Maquis and Starfleet tactical experience . The question is : How do we dislodge it without losing structural integrity ? With power down , our containment field 's already extremely unstable . We 'll have to reroute additional power to the containment field and tow their shuttle out with one of our own . Then we can repair the breach . The shields and the warp drive will have to wait . Warp drive isn 't going to do us much good with this knife stuck in our belly . Get it out fast . We don 't want the Kazon to put too much distance between us . Forgive me , Captain , but are you sure going after the Nistrim is the wisest course of action ? After what they 've already done to us ? Let me make something very clear . The Nistrim are in possession of Federation technology . That is an unacceptable situation . Even though all they 've stolen is a small computer component ? That " small component " has the potential to cause vast problems in this Quadrant . You 're our resident expert on the Kazon . What do you think the other sects will do when they realize the Nistrim have transporter capabilities ? They 'll try to get it for themselves any way they can . You 're right . It could alter the balance of power among the sects . Exactly , and it is our duty to do everything we can , no matter how dangerous to stop that from happening . You can count on me , Captain . From the look of these sensor readings , Seska wants us to come after her . Commander ? I think Seska 's leading us into another trap . She masterminded a precision raid that made us look like first-year Academy students , but she left a warp trail for us to follow . After such a flawless performance , why would she suddenly make that kind of mistake ? You think she wants more than the transporter ? Are you suggesting we don 't follow her ? No , I agree with everything you said about preventing the spread of our technology , but conventional tactics aren 't going to work with Seska . We 'll need to come at her with a few surprises of our own . I 'm open to suggestions . Perhaps Commander Chakotay could use his intimate knowledge of Seska to manipulate her in much the same way she manipulated us . It can move people great distances in the blink of an eye , Haron , but this " transporter " is only the beginning . Go on . I 'm listening . There is a ship filled with new technology . Devices that can make food , water- - even weapons- - appear out of thin air . A computer system which uses neural tissue that can react twice as fast ours . Very interesting , Culluh , but what does all this have to do with me ? That ship is on its way here . Help us , and we can divide the spoils . The module Seska stole contains a quantum resonance oscillator . So , we modify this coil scanner to detect the oscillator . Then we get close enough to beam it back . I 'm betting Seska 's figured out a way to shield the module from our transporters . We might have to destroy it instead . How do we do that ? We borrow a trick from Seska 's book . Remember how we disabled the computer core on the Cardassian frigate orbiting Bajor ? Seska modified an antiproton beam to penetrate its shields and hull . Exactly . But if I remember correctly , the beam was only effective from an extremely close range . How do we get near enough to the Nistrim ship ? One thing at a time . You 're taking this all very personally , aren 't you ? Why shouldn 't I ? You are not responsible for what happened . Oh , no ? I let her join the Maquis . I took her into my confidence . I even got ... intimately involved with her . So you have lousy taste in women . Look , Chakotay , she fooled us all . She was my best friend- - or at least that 's what I thought . Well , I , for one , am through being manipulated by her . Are you sure ? Because she 's affecting you . That 's just where she wants you . Don 't tense up . So now I 'm getting advice about controlling my emotions from you . Our sects have been blood enemies for generations . And yet , now you ask for my help to defeat this Voyager . Why not simply do it yourselves ? I 'll tell you why . Because the Nistrim are weak and the Relora are strong . Your grandfather 's time has passed , Culluh . You 've presided over the demise of your own sect , whittled away - your strength ... - Enough ! You may have ships and soldiers , but I have the technology . And I congratulate you on the daring and cunning of your raid . Now , why don 't you give me this transporter technology- - assuming it 's authentic- - and let the Relora do what we do best . When we have defeated the Voyager , we will not forget the Nistrim 's assistance . You think I 'm a fool . I won 't hand this technology over to you . Then perhaps we will have to take it . Why don 't we let the maje go back to his ship while we consider his offer ? Listen to your woman , Culluh . I 'm picking up a gap in the Nistrim 's warp trail , Captain . All stop . Let 's take a look . Captain , I 've got some floating debris at bearing 319 mark 4 . On screen . What is it ? I 'm not sure yet . Magnify . I 'm detecting a residual transporter signature . There is no doubt that this man and his unfortunate companion were beamed into space . And according to these readings , they were alive at the time , Captain . It looks like Seska 's already adapted the transporter module into the Kazon systems and started experimenting with it . Her early trials appear to have been less than successful . I 'm not so sure these men died by accident , Captain . You see this green band he 's wearing ? It means he was the First Maje of the Kazon-Relora . Relora ? Sworn enemies of the Nistrim . It 's conceivable that Seska and Culluh used the transporter to execute these men . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49208.5 . I have convened a meeting of the senior staff to determine how we can get close enough to the Nistrim ship to deploy the antiproton beam . Where 's Chakotay ? He was in Engineering helping me modify the coil scanner . He said he 'd be right up . Janeway to Chakotay . Computer , locate Commander Chakotay . Commander Chakotay is not aboard the ship . Computer , when will we intercept the Kazon vessel ? Approximately 30 minutes . What I want to know , Mr. Tuvok , is how he was able to get a shuttlecraft off this ship without either of us knowing about it . Apparently , he was able to override the lock-out command . I guess Seska 's not the only one who knows how to compromise our security systems . I assure you , Captain , it will not happen again . See that it doesn 't . Did Chakotay leave any clue about what he 's up to ? I have accessed his personal logs , but there is no reference to his leaving Voyager . I guess he was in too big a hurry to leave a note . The coil scanner was right here . He must have taken it with him . Then I guess it 's pretty clear he 's going after Seska . Looks like that . You were working with him , Lieutenant . Did he say anything to you ? Just that he felt responsible for Seska , and was determined to stop her , but I never thought he would try to do this alone . How big a head start does he have ? Approximately three hours . Janeway to Conn . Paris here , Captain . Lay in a pursuit course for Commander Chakotay 's shuttlecraft , maximum impulse . Acknowledged . And Mr. Tuvok , I want a complete review of all security protocols on this ship by 2200 hours . Aye , Captain . You said the Relora would join us . I should never have listened to you . I was wrong . I 'm sorry . Kazon sects do not help one another . Don 't be so sure about that . What did you do to the two men who refused your offer ? I killed them . Yes , and by doing that , you sent a message . " The Kazon-Nistrim are powerful again . " First Maje Jal Culluh has technology " that no other sect possesses . Join with him or suffer the consequences . " Maybe the mistake was to approach the Relora . They 're already strong . But the transporter may be enough to convince the Hobii to join me , and perhaps the Mostral . Yes , and with a few more ships , you can defeat Voyager . And when you have the rest of their technology , the other sects will have no choice but to fall into line . That 's why I sent a subspace message to the Mostral the Hobii and the Oglamar . You did what ? I told them about the transporter . Asked them to help us take Voyager . You have gone too far . I sent the messages in your name . I am the leader of this sect . You are only a woman . I 'm sorry , Culluh . You will address me as Maje ! Yes ... Maje . Please ... forgive me . So ... how did the other sects respond to my request ? They 're on their way to join us . I could do what no one has done since Jal Sankur united the sects to overthrow the Trabe . Yes , Maje . I could have hundreds of ships and thousands of soldiers under my command . Yes , Maje . I could be the most powerful Kazon in the Quadrant . Yes , Maje . Come in . Do you have a minute , Captain ? It 's about Chakotay . That 's not exactly my favorite subject right now , Lieutenant . Well , I thought that maybe I could explain ... Explain what ? Why my First Officer publicly defied my authority by commandeering a shuttle without permission ? I know it was never his intention to defy you . He respects your authority . But ... ? But he 's a very proud man , and he 's been ... embarrassed by Seska . What Seska did , she did to all of us . Frankly , I find it more than a little self-indulgent of Chakotay to assume this is all about him . He never said it to me directly , but ... I think he was in love with her , and then he found out that everything he knew about her was a lie . You said that he publicly defied your authority . Can you imagine what it must have been like for someone as private as Chakotay to be publicly humiliated by someone he loved ? And then , as if that weren 't enough , she came back to taunt him in front of the entire Bridge crew . I 'm sure it was very painful for him , but what you 're saying is he 's got a personal score to settle . That 's only part of it . I know Chakotay . This is his way of taking responsibility . In his mind , he 's trying to protect the rest of us from a dangerous situation which he created . Maybe , but that doesn 't give him the privilege of ignoring this ship 's chain of command . I know that . It 's just that ... Chakotay would never tell you any of this himself . And assuming we get him back in one piece , you want to make sure I take his personal feelings into account before I decide how to discipline him . I know that you 're well within your rights to throw him into the brig , but ... Well ... Chakotay is lucky to have such a good friend . I 'll tell you what . Why don 't we deal with getting him back in one piece first . We can worry about the discipline later . Thank you . Computer , when will we enter the Kazon vessel 's scanner range ? Approximately six minutes . Reduce power to maneuvering thrusters and life support to five percent . Cut all power to other systems . The Mostral should be here in less than 20 hours . The Hobii in 15 . Come look at this . Intermittent EM readings ? I don 't think so . Computer , initiate continuous scans for the transporter oscillator . Initiating scans . Those aren 't normal fluctuations . They 're energy spikes from maneuvering thrusters . Probably a shuttle running shadow maneuvers . He knows our scanners can 't pinpoint energy readings that low . Who ? Maybe we can resonate a coherent polaron pulse off his hull . Get a lock on him that way . Initiate a continuous stream of pulses from the lateral deflectors . Maje ? Come on , Seska . Where did you hide that module ? There you are . Open a channel . To whom ? Just transmit on wide-band subspace . He 'll hear me . Come on , find it ! Hello , Chakotay . Very clever maneuvering , but I 'm not about to let you ruin all my hard work . Deploy a spread of photonic charges centered on coordinates 124 by 217 - - 20 percent nominal yield . That won 't be enough . We want that shuttle intact . Got you . Computer , power the antiproton generator . Generator ready . Target a concentrated beam to these coordinates . Beam targeted . Initiate ! The generator is off-line . Great . Computer , launch the automated message beacon . Beacon launched . Now take the inertial dampers off-line . He 's lost control of the shuttle . We have him . Lock the towing emitter onto his vessel and bring him into the main hangar . Culluh calling Seska . This is Seska . He 's not here . He must have transported aboard . Find him ! I 'm right here . Activate the message beacon . Lovely to see you again . Captain , I 'm detecting a Federation beacon at bearing 059 mark 72 . This one 's definitely ours- - Starfleet issue . All stop . The beacon is transmitting an automated message . It is from Commander Chakotay . On screen . ... to Voyager . If this signal has been activated , it means that I have destroyed the Nistrim 's transporter capabilities . Captain , I apologize for acting without authorization , but I ask you not to put the ship or crew in further jeopardy by attempting to rescue me . It 's unlikely that I 'm still alive . Chakotay to Voyager . If this signal has been activated ... You can go . I see the Nistrim take orders from you now . Let 's just say I 'm in a position of some influence , which is fortunate for you . Culluh wanted to execute you immediately , but I convinced him that you 'd be a valuable prisoner and that I should be the one to interrogate you . Lucky me . Would you like a drink ? The Kazon word for this is " enemy 's blood . " It 's not exactly fine cognac , but I 've developed a taste for it . Try some . No , thanks . You know , I 've got to hand it to you . I thought all these months answering to Janeway would have made you soft , but all you needed was a little slap in the face to get that Maquis heart of yours beating again . Here 's to old times . I have no interest in reminiscing with you . I destroyed the transporter module . The game 's over . What do I need with a single transporter module when I 've got your shuttle and all its technology sitting in our hanger ? I think you 'll find that technology useless . I wiped the computer core before I transported . I should have anticipated that . So if you 're going to have me killed , just do it . You 're still the noble one , aren 't you ? Ready to die for your shipmates . You know , Chakotay , I may not have the transporter anymore , but I 've got something better . You . Maybe that 's all I really wanted . I 've missed you . You can 't possibly believe that you and I could still ... Don 't flatter yourself . It was never that good . You might have been an interesting diversion now and then , but I 've always been less interested in you than in the information you could provide me with . First , you gave me your Maquis secrets and now I want Voyager 's command codes . If you think I 'm going to give you those codes , you don 't know me as well as you think you do . Maybe not , but for old time 's sake , I 'll let you in on a little secret . There are half a dozen ships from other Kazon sects on their way here right now . They 're joining us to help take Voyager . Why are you telling me this ? I 'm not a monster . I still care about Torres and some of the others . I don 't want to see anybody get hurt . I never did . I 'm touched . These Kazon aren 't as reasonable as you and I . I 'm going to have to use all my influence to make sure they don 't kill you all . But you 've got to give me something to work with . Voyager 's not coming . I left them explicit instructions not to follow me . So you can stop worrying about people getting hurt . They 'll come . They 'd never leave their First Officer in the hands of the Kazon . You may not give me the command codes , but when Culluh gets through with you , you 'll wish you had . The message appears to be authentic , Captain . We 've got to go get him . Commander Chakotay has expressly requested that we not attempt to do so . We don 't have to honor that request . Captain ? If a rescue attempt forces us to engage the Kazon , there is always a possibility that more of our technology will fall into their hands . Kim to the Captain . I 'm picking up several vessels converging on the Nistrim 's location . My gut tells me we should go after Chakotay ... but my better judgment , tells me we should honor his request . I would never want you to ignore your judgment , Captain , but let me ask you this . In your judgment , how would the loss of our First Officer affect this crew ? What would it do to the morale on this ship ? Maybe this is an instance when your gut is giving you better advice . Janeway to Conn . Paris here . Resume a course for Chakotay 's shuttle . Aye , Captain . I 'm losing patience , Federation . Just tell him what he needs to know . She 's quite a woman , isn 't she ? Does she rub your shoulders and tell you you 're the most exciting man she 's ever known ? That 's what she used to do for me . What 's the matter ? Didn 't she tell you about us ? Stop playing games and give me the command codes . Flattery , devotion , sex ... I always thought she had a lot to offer a man . You talk too much , Federation , but you 're not telling me what I need to know . You 're wrong , Culluh . I 'm telling you exactly what you need to know . She 's using you . I 'm the one who 's using her . You 've done an even better job on him than you did on me . You talk to me , not to her . Then what 's she doing here ? Watching you work ? ! She used to like to watch me work , too . I don 't believe a word you 're saying , so you can stop trying to distract me now and start answering questions . You know one thing I especially liked ? The little mole on her stomach . I guess you 've seen it . I 'm through wasting my strength on you . Now give me the command codes . I 'll give you something better . What ? Firsthand information . Go ahead . When Seska 's through with you she 's going to kill you . He 's delirious . He doesn 't know what he 's saying . Give him some time . I 'll be back in one hour . For his sake , he 'd better be more cooperative . Very clever ploy , Chakotay , but you know I 'm not a killer . If I were , you 'd have been dead a long time ago . I have located the Nistrim vessel on long-range sensors . Distance--.4 light-years . However , they are not alone . There are now at least six other Kazon ships in the immediate vicinity . I didn 't think Culluh had that many ships . They must belong to enemy sects . That may be so , but the ships have not powered their weapon systems . What do you make of it , Neelix ? It 's certainly unusual for rival Kazon sects to congregate peacefully . Is it possible the Nistrim have formed an alliance with other sects ? I 've never known the Kazon to do anything like that before . If the Nistrim have added six ships to their force , it would be tactically unwise to engage them . Then we 'll just have to find a way of getting Chakotay out of there without picking a fight . We can transport him out . We would have to slow down once within transporter range , giving the Kazon ample time to open fire . Not necessarily . We could beam him out at warp speed without even slowing down . The Kazon would never be able to catch us . That 's difficult enough when both ships are traveling at warp . The Kazon ship 's not even moving . I can compensate for that . How ? By synchronizing the transporter 's annular confinement beam to the warp core frequency . Maybe , but at a relative speed of two billion kilometers per second , it 's pretty tough to get a lock on somebody . Ensign Kim is correct . We would risk scrambling his transporter signal and killing him . It would be a direct violation of Starfleet safety protocols . Do you have a better idea ? Trust me , Captain . I can do it . How can you be so sure ? Because I 've done it before . When you are a Maquis , you don 't always have the luxury of following protocols . Ah ! Jal Surat of the Mostral . May I present Jal Loran of the Hobii and Jal Valek of the Oglamar ? We 've met before ... in battle . Please , Jal Surat , sit down . Today is a day Kazon children will remember for generations . Today is the day we put aside our differences and join forces to defeat Voyager . Today is the day that marks the end of the supremacy of the Relora and the Ogla because , after today , we will have the Federation technology and the other sects will run when they see us . That 's a fine speech , Culluh , but what makes you think Voyagerwon 't use this technology to defeat us ? Because I have Voyager 's command codes . I have heard what you did to the Relora maje and his companion- - very impressive- - but before I make an enemy of these Federations , I want proof that you have their command codes . May I present Commander Chakotay- - Voyager 's First Officer . 60 seconds to transporter range , Captain . Bridge to Torres . Have you located Chakotay ? I 'm reading Kazon life signs , but still no Chakotay . Captain , I must remind you that we have no direct evidence the Commander is still alive , or if he is , that he 's still aboard that ship . I 'm not conceding that yet . Can you give me anything , B 'Elanna ? I 'm picking up some kind of localized dampening field . It 's blocking our targeting scanners . Maybe Seska 's found a way to hide Chakotay from us . You may be right . I 've got to reinitialize the targeting scanners to match the relative phase of the dampening field . I 've found him , Captain . He 's still alive . Can you get him out of there ? The damping field is disrupting our transporter signal . I can 't get a lock on him . Red Alert . Mr. Paris , take us out of warp . It 's Voyager . Well , Culluh ? What are you waiting for ? Use the command codes to disable them . Bridge , this is First Maje Culluh . Lock weapons onto the Federation ship and fire . Mr. Paris , evasive pattern delta four . Mr. Tuvok , return fire . Firing phasers . Bridge to Torres . Can you transport Chakotay ? I 'm matching the pattern buffer frequency to the Kazon dampening field . Make it fast . I 've got a lock . Initiating transport . Do you have him , B 'Elanna ? I had him for a second , but they 've remodulated the dampening field . Can you compensate ? I 'm trying , but I need more time . We 'll try to hold them off , but we don 't have long . Mr. Tuvok , phasers to maximum . Let 's give them a little distraction . Why are you allowing them to continue firing ? It 's taking longer than I thought to interface with their systems . You must order your ships to provide cover . I hope you know what you 're doing . The other Kazon vessels have opened fire . Mr. Paris , evasive pattern omega two . Aye , Captain . Bridge to Torres . You 're going to have to hurry it up down there . We can 't hold them off much longer . I 'm doing the best I can . We 're losing patience , Culluh . Where are you going ? To the Bridge . I might have better luck interfacing with Voyager 's systems from there . I 'll go with you . You 'll stay right here . Aft shields down to 23 percent , Captain . Bridge to Torres . Can you transport Chakotay out or not ? They 've put the dampening field on some kind of randomly fluctuating modulation . It 'll take me at least an hour to match the phase variances . Shields at 16 percent . Captain , we must retreat . Lieutenant , just how localized is that dampening field ? A little more than two meters in diameter- - just enough to isolate Chakotay . Why ? I think I 've got an idea . I don 't think you ever had those command codes . I think you 're a liar . What does it matter ? If we work together , we don 't need the command codes to beat them . You 're right . We can beat them , but we 're going to do it without you . We 're taking your ship . Please stay where you are . You will find that our transporters have rendered your weapons useless . I will make you very sorry for this , Culluh . Here are the terms , gentlemen . The safe return of our First Officer and shuttlecraft in exchange for your freedom . I presume you will find that an acceptable arrangement . Captain 's Log , Stardate 4921 1.5 . Now that Commander Chakotay has made a full recovery , I 'm faced with the difficult task of responding to his failure to follow procedure . Just tell me one thing . What were you thinking ? About keeping our technology out of Kazon hands . I thought if I did it on my own , I could keep the rest of the crew out of danger . That may be a very noble sentiment , but it wasn 't your decision to make . Oh , Chakotay ... we 've spent the last ten months together on this ship . I thought we had an understanding . Why did you choose to ignore procedure ? Seska was my problem- - a problem I felt it was my duty to solve . So you had a ... personal score to settle . I thought I was doing the right thing . Really ? Tell me this . How do you expect me to keep order when the First Officer takes it upon himself to run off like some cowboy because he decides it 's a good idea ? What you did was commendable . The way you did it was not . You set a terrible example , and on a personal level , you 've made my job more difficult . If that 's so , I regret it . I 'm putting you on report , in case that means anything anymore . It means something to me , Captain . It means I 've let you down and for that , I 'm truly sorry . Bridge to ready room . Go ahead , Mr. Tuvok . I think you and Commander Chakotay should come in here . On our way . I have located an automated message beacon , Captain . Another one ? It is a message to Commander Chakotay from Seska . Would you like Mr. Kim to put it through to your office ? No , I think I 've spent enough time alone with Seska . Very well . Put it on screen . Hello , Chakotay . Congratulations on your victory . I look forward to our next meeting . Oh , and there 's something you should know . While you were unconscious , I took the liberty of extracting a sample of your DNA . I impregnated myself with it . So , I guess more congratulations are in order . You 're going to be a father .

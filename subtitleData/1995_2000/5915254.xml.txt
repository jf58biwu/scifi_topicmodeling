 - Good morning , Dr. Albright . - Oh , Nina , call the Florist and tell them no carnations . I want those flowers that look like bird 's heads with a stick stuck in its eye . You know , the good ones ? Why ? What 's going on ? - She 's having some big affair . You tramp ! Oh ! Dick , it 's a catered affair . You 're cheating on me and your diet ? ! No , the North Rutherford country club is planning its charity auction and I volunteered my house . I didn 't know you were in a club . Well , they haven 't asked me to join , not yet . They have the most wonderful health spa . Not to mention Pool , Tennis , Golf , Spa Cuisine . - Not that that 's important . - Oh , no . - I 'm doing this for charity . - Oh , what charity ? Oh , something for kids . Orphans , I think . I 've got so much to do ! I hope I haven 't left anything out ! Well , let 's see . You 've kissed butt , sucked up , fawned over and stroked them . A little wine and cheese and it 's party time . - Where 's my guest list ? - On my desk . Oh , I 'll go get it . - What is wrong with her ? - She ' climbing the social ladder . The what ? I 'm sorry , Nina , I don 't understand Ebonics . No , you know , you try to fit in with a group of people by pretending you 're just like them . You talk like them , you act like them until they think you 're one of them . - You know what that 's like . - No ! No , I don 't ! And neither does Tommy , Sally and Harry ! No , we 're not social climbers ! - We 're humans ! - Oh , I 've invited so many people , - I hope my place is big enough . - I have an idea . - Why don 't you have your meeting at my place ? - Your place ? Ah , well . See , Dick , most of the people are coming from North Rutherford and your place is ... all the way over on the other side of town . But the buses run until 9 : 00 . What she means is you live on the wrong side of the tracks . That 's not what I 'm saying ... out loud . - What ? - Well , it 's just that I 've tried so hard to get these people to accept me that I don 't want to invite them to my boyfriend 's attic with his ... unusual brother and ... angry amazon sister in ... the heart of the meat packing district . No offense . - No , none taken . - Or understood . - Oh , that 's gotta hurt . This is an incredible sport . These guys must be the best athletes on earth ! Well , they don 't call it professional wrestling for nothing . Turn off the TV ! But Dick , it 's your favorite ! " The Grave Digger ! " I don 't care who it is . We 're not .. - oh look , he 's got a new shovel . Do you think we live on the wrong side of the tracks ? What are you talking about ? The tracks are right over there . Yeah , if we lived on the other side of them , we 'd have to wait for the train to pass every time we went to the liquor store . - Hi , did I miss the grudge match ? Mrs. Dubcek , have you ever been to North Rutherford ? North Rutherford , sure . I once had a fling with a pool boy up there . Lovely cabana , very nice . Well what 's so special about it ? Well it 's a very different class of people there . - Different class ? - You mean , not Homo Sapiens ? Oh no , they have their " artsy " types too , but they 're very discreet . Hey , Solomon . Hey , Elman , Romano . How 's it going , guys ? - You are dead , Solomon ! - What did I ever do to you ? You bust out laughing in math class any time we say anything ! Sure , but guys , only the really stupid stuff . - Get him ! - Wait ! If I had known it bothered you guys- - believe me , I won 't do it again ! Hello ? Anybody out there ? This is not funny .. - hi . - Are you okay ? Oh , yeah , I 'm fine . How are you ? Hey , don 't let those guys bother you . They 're just having fun . Oh , yeah , I know . We had a few laughs last week when they " pantsed " me in the cafeteria . - I 'm Lorna . - Oh yeah , I know . - You were in my math class last year . - Oh , right . - What happened to you ? - I passed . You know , Lorna ... - I realized something sitting in that locker . - What was that ? I really should wash my gym shorts more often . What 's that ? Oh , nothing , it was some stupid poetry I wrote . Can I read it ? - It 's not very good . - Oh , come on , come on . Whatever . " Last night , death signed my yearbook . 'Have a good summer , ' he wrote . 'See you next year " and then I realized it wasn 't my yearbook he signed . It was my tombstone . " - What do you think ? - I like it . Especially the surprise ending there . You are the first one to get the irony . What do you think of the one on the back ? Ah . " Death sent me an e-mail . " There 's a motif here , right ? - Yeah . - Ah . Mr. And Mrs. St. Clair , so good to see you again . We 've met before ? Well , yes , several times . We were trapped in an elevator for six hours . Doesn 't ring a bell . I .. pried open the roof and climbed two stories to get help . Oh , yes ! and she had on those awful leatherette boots . Excuse . Hello , Mary ! I brought you a box of wine . - I don 't drink that . - Well , then why do you keep running out of it ? Give me the damn box . I 'll have a glass of Merlot . And I 'll have a nice Hawaiian punch . Don 't believe we 've met .. Edgar St. Clair . Don 't believe we 've met Edgar Allen Poe . But , um ... but I 'm Dick Solomon . And what do you do , Mr. Solomon ? I 'm in ... Physics ... Mr. St. Clair . Physics , eh ? You know , I always thought if I hadn 't gone into business , - I 'd have done something in physics . - Yeahhh ... and if you had wheels , you 'd be a bus . - Actually , I own several bus lines . - Really ? Then all you need is the chassis . How 's everything here ? Perfect , thank you , Mary . No ... thank you for coming . - It 's my pleasure . - Oh , no ... it 's my pleasure to have you here . Thank you again . - So sad . - Yes , she 's trying so hard you can almost smell the desperation . Oh , no , I think that 's her dog . You are a ticket . Say , you must come by the club . The boys should meet you . It 'll be a kick . Oh , good . Can I kick back ? Oh , hi , Lorna . Uh , bye , Lorna . - Back for more , genius ? - You 're dead , Einstein . Will you guys stop ? You just want to beat him up because he 's smart . So ? Uh , now wait a minute , guys , she 's right . If you think about it ... I 'm smart , and you guys are morons , nothing personal ... wouldn 't it make more sense for you to use my intelligence to your advantage ? Huh ? Here , let me use a visual aid . - Take that kid- - - Okay . - This one ? - Uh , yeah , yeah . Now see , you 'd probably like to beat him up , right ? - Definitely . - Yeah . But you shouldn 't because his sister 's dating the third floor hall monitor and if you beat him up , you 'll never be able to ditch Chemistry . - We don 't take Chemistry . - No . But now you can and you 'll never have to go . See ? Told you he was smart . We don 't have to take Chemistry . Singapore Sal , the iron maiden , circles her prey . Her opponent , handsome Harry , circles nervously , hoping to avoid yet another serious injury . You 're good . Real good . Oh , well , hello , pair of hooligans . - Who 's the dork ? - Oh , Harry Solomon , nice to meet you . - Come on , guys . - Where you going ? - Out on the roof . - What 'cha gonna do ? - Burn stuff , throw junk at cars . - Have a good time . I like his friends . Nice kids . I know , me too , sweetie . Well , it started it . So , how was your party ? - Did you play " pin the tail on the Bentley " ? - No , no . Mostly we just played " pin the cheese on the cracker . " Mmm ... exciting party , huh ? Exciting ? It was awful . I had a two-hour conversation with someone about Cornish gay men . Are you sure it wasn 't " Cornish game hen ? " That 's what I said , " Cornish gay men . " Aren 't you listening ? Okay . Good morning , everybody . - Wasn 't last night fun ? Have you ever met a group of more interesting people ? - Here , Mr. St. Clair called . - Oh . Mr. St. Clair called . That 's so exciting . What did he say ? - He said to call him back . - Oh , isn 't that sweet ? Mr. St. Clair wants me to call him back . What do you think I should do ? - Call him back . - Oh right , right . Ah , yes , is Mr. St. Clair in ? Mr. St. Clair , Mary Albright . Hi . What ? Oh , I 'd be honored to come . Who ? Dick ? Well , sure , I 'll bring him . Yes , he is that . Well , thank you . No , no ... thank you . Bye . This is so exciting . The St. Clairs' want to invite us to their club tomorrow night . Tomorrow ? I can 't ! Well , why not ? Well , for openers , tomorrow is ... spaghetti and waffle night and the whole family is going mad with anticipation . Can 't you cancel ? Well .. and break their little hearts ? No , Sally 's already made the pesto syrup . So ... bring them along . Oh , Dick , I really want to go . - And they really want you to be there . - Why ? Well , they like you . They think you 're fun . Oh , please . For me ? All right . Fine , Mary . For you . Oh , thanks . I appreciate it . No , it 's okay . We 're having spaghetti and waffles tonight , too . hey ! hey ! Hey , Tommy , I 'm sorry . It was just an accident . Hey , You don 't sweat it . Get lost now . - Hey , Solomon , let 's get out of here . - All right , man . Wait , where are you guys going ? - We 're going to go set off the fire alarm . yeah . - Why ? - Why ? 'Cause the alarm 's going to go off and there 's going to be kids running everywhere and they 're - going to have to evacuate the whole building . - Yeah , bro . It made more sense the first time he explained it . - Boy : yo , Solomon ! - Yo , what 's up ? No , that 's not it . That 's not it . Oh , that 's it ! Head butts . You ready ? Sally ! Tommy ! Harry ! Listen up ! This is very important . We 've been asked to hob-knob with the Creme de la Creme of Rutherford 's elite . Hmm , well , I 'm okay hob-wise . It 's the knob part what concerns me . The evening is very important to Mary . - We 've got to make a good first impression . - Whatever . Now Sally ? Edgar St. Clair 's nephew buzzy will be there . He has a face like a horse . I want you to charm him . I 'll bring a carrot . Now , Harry , you will pose as Sally 's wealthy cousin . - Ah , am I well bred ? - You 're overbred . In fact ... you 're mute . Mmm , all Righty . Oh , I mean ... Now , Sally , they already adore me . But you must strive to be accepted by these people . Accepted ? Dick ? have you forgotten how hot I am ? I mean , good looking women are accepted at more places than American express . I could belch the alphabet and men with PhDs would be asking me - to tutor their kids . Great news ! I am now the coolest punk in school . Well , congratulations ! What did you do ? I got suspended for setting off the fire alarm . They suspended you for that ? ! You saved hundreds of lives ! No , no , no . That 's the best part . There was no fire . Tommy ! This is outrageous ! The next time you set off a fire alarm , you damn well better start a fire first ! I can never do anything right for you , now can I ? I 'll be right down . - Have you noticed ? - What ? There 's no TV in this room . Then why does it exist ? - Okay ... how do I look ? - Oh , very nice . - But not great . - You look great . No , you would have said great if I looked great . Mary , you look fantastic . You 're right , too busy . I 'll go change . There 's no TV in there either . There is no TV anywhere on the ground floor . That explains why she 's so weird . It 's why them hoidy-toidies didn 't like her party . She 's got no TV . How does she live ? Actually , she gets a lot of information from books . - Get out ! - What ? Sometimes she even reads for entertainment . What , like TV guide ? No . What do you think , pearls or gold ? Mary ? the only accessory you need is me . Aw ... I 'll go get a scarf . - Hey , Lorna . - Hi , Tommy . - Hey , where were you today ? - Home . I 'm just here picking up some books because I was ... suspended . - Bye , Tommy . - Wait , where are you going ? Tommy , I liked you because you were smart . Now you 're just like Elman and Romano . But you hang out with Elman and Romano . They have cars . Now you 're just like them . But without a car . I can change back , I can be smart again . I 'll be having my butt kicked by tomorrow afternoon . Here , stuff me in a locker . If only it were that easy , Tommy . But you can never go back . I 've seen it a million times . So Dick , this weekend , any chance we can squeeze in 18 holes ? It depends . How big are the holes ? So you 're saying that when a 300-pound Soprano and a 250-pound Tenor dress in funny costumes and take 15 minutes to die , that 's art . But when the grave digger takes on the caped Canadian , that 's trash ? I 'm sorry , I don 't get it . Well , my point is the cultural " histoire " .. yeah , yeah , talk is cheap . Let 's go outside and settle this thing . Why do you call it " bacon " ? You don 't " bake " it , you fry it . Why the devil can 't they call it " frycon " ? Am I right , Eggie ? You know , I think he 's on to something . So , I made a brief stop-over in Spain , and then .. Really ? I understand the plains of Spain experience ... mainly rain . I 'm really impressed with Dick . He 's got them eating out of his hands . Yeah , I tried that once and got bit by a goat . Oh , look at me . All my life I 've been on the outside looking in . Now I 'm on the inside . - You want to go outside ? - Never again . I 'm going outside . - Five hundred . - That much ? - I 'm afraid you were taken , my friend . - Was I ? Yes , I only paid twenty dollars for mine , and it 's a Rolex , too . The trick is to buy it straight off the truck . No overhead . - Have you listened to him ? - Who ? The " Nutty Professor . " - Lord knows which rock St. Clair found him under . Remember when he invited the dutch transvestite to read our palms ? And where did he get that accent ? May I have your attention , please ? Dickie has just informed me about something , and I think everyone should hear it . Thank you , Eggie . I don 't mean to panic anyone , but I 'm afraid the calamari is infested with baby squid ! Dick , suddenly I 'm not feeling very well . Mary , you didn 't eat the calamari , did you ? - Yes , that 's it . - We 've got to get you out of here ! Harry , Sally , bring the car around . I 'm sorry , boys , got to amscray . Ta-Ta . Mary , you 're spoiling our fun . You know , if I were you , and had your money , the first thing I 'd do is hire a good surgeon to have that huge cob removed from my butt . You may have your little clubhouse , but none of you is truly happy . Actually , we are . Well , then , some of you are ... " Fat " . Oh , Mary , what a wonderful evening that was . The ambiance , the people , the repartee .. - I hated it . - Oh , wasn 't it dreadful ? I thought you were having such a good time . I wanted to stick a chilled salad fork into my eye . I don 't know what I ever saw in those people . I guess I spent so much time trying to impress them that I never stopped to realize that they weren 't worth impressing . You 're worth impressing , Mary . Thank you . - You know one thing I did like about them ? - What ? - Their shrimp puffs . - I didn 't have any . - I 've got some right here . - Oh ... oh , wait , wait ! I have dipping sauce . No , thanks . You know , in a way it 's a shame things didn 't work out better . After all , they seem to like everything you do . Not everything . ? They can 't take that away from me ? ? no , they can 't take that away ? ? from me . ? Surprise ! Oh my god ! Now you have a TV on the ground floor . That 's the biggest TV I 've ever seen . How did you afford this ? I sold your grandmother 's antique end tables . What ? Actually , that only covered the down payment . You have 12 more monthly payments of $ 265.00 . Gunsmoke !

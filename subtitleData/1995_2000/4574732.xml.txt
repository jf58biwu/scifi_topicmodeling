What do you think he said ? I thought the guy was gonna cry . It was pitiful . So he agreed to give me somebody to help out . That 's that . The guy 's like an assistant . I 'm glad . Who ? You mean like , who 's the guy ? He 's just a guy- - a new guy . A new guy you don 't know . A really new guy you don 't know . - So you 're saying is he 's new . - Yeah .

I 'm not sure we agreed on a specific time . We were real specific . 1 : 30 . In fact , I repeated it twice . - Do you want solid or the laminates ? - Laminates . That is strange . For some reason , 2 : 30 just stuck in my head . I 'd Iike to stick something else in your head . You 're fired . Take your New York watch and fat L.A. ass and get out of here . I 'm getting somebody else . - For being a few minutes late ? - No . That 's not a few . Three , four- - that 's a few . You were 60 minutes late . That 's not a few .

You know , I 've been thinking . This is just not working out . - What ? - This new arrangement . I 'm not getting anything done . I 'm not getting any work done . all I do is cook and I do laundry . I pick up and drop off the kids , dress the kids , undress the kids ... and I clean up after them . I 've been doing that for ten years . You 've been doing it for a month . I know . But it comes more naturally to you . How so ? Hon , you 're a nurturer . You know ? You are . First of all , you got the two X chromosomes . And I got a couple of- - l don 't know what I have . But it 's scientifically proven . That 's why you have breasts . Look at me- - - I have nothing . - Just what are you saying ? This whole system isn 't working . It 's a dismal failure . We have to go back to the way it worked : you taking care of the house- - which you do really welI- - and I have to do what I need to do . And what do you need to do ? I gotta get back to work , and that 's it . No , actually , that 's not it . I Iove my job , and so far , I 'm doing great at it . valerie said if I keep it up , she 's gonna move me into estates . So very soon I could be making a very good living . I know this is hard for you , and I can imagine the day you 've had ... but I am not quitting . So we 're just gonna have to work this out . And that is it . That 's really funny . You think that 's it . Because that 's not it . The thing I said , that 's it . This thing that you just said- - not it . This is it . I can 't believe you lured me here for this . This is the lowest thing you 've ever done . Excuse me . Can I have some water over here ? I didn 't lure you into anything . - Thanks . - l had no idea . You tease me sometimes , and I kind of like it ... but I always assumed you were happily married . I 've been sleeping in the guest house for a month . Oh , my God . Is it that bad ? Yeah , it 's pretty bad . She 's sleeping with another guy . And that is the God 's honest truth . It 's over . She doesn 't even know I exist . It must be so hard for you . It is . - Do you wanna come back to my place ? - Yeah . Look , I just thought- - Are you all right ? What 's wrong ? Are you all right ?

What are you doing with Noreen ? She 's a colleague . Business meeting . Just talking . Don 't give me that ! You 're up to something . What are you talking about ? What ? Are you jealous ? You can 't cheat on Laura ! I never even get to see Laura ! Look , this isn 't working out . What are you talking about ? This whole deal . We 'll switch . I 'Il go back to work and you 'lI help out around the house . That 's a better system . I think we oughta do that . Yeah , right . I 'm gonna hang around and do housework ? - Yeah- - - l 'm sorry. I thought you were joking . No way in hell that 's gonna happen . Not only that ... you 've no idea what I 've been doing for the past four weeks . - You 'd be lost . - I 'd be- - l got you the job . What do you think , I 'm a genie ? You rub a lamp and I pop out and do what you want me to do ? I got things I need to do too ! You chose the arrangement . I didn 't ! Look , things change . You took away my wife , my family . I 've got no friends . I 'm alone in a garage . I got nothing but my job . Okay. I did it . all right ? And now I 'm doing the work you couldn 't do . I 'm finally making it pay , so get off my back . Down ! What ? You never saw a guy wash another guy 's face before ? Yes , of course . Please , carry on . That 's it . What are you doing ? A guy came in . I had to do something . Look- - I didn 't know you felt that way . We 'Il work this out later . In the meantime , I 'lI distract Laura . You get Noreen out of here . This guy 's in way over his head . - I 'm ready for dessert . - Good . That 's not your sport coat , is it ? Yeah . No ! I switched with a guy in the mens ' room . We just traded .

I have the whole thing figured out . Oh , man ! What do we need him for ? He 's going to help me with the kids and around the house . And when you weren 't busy with work , you guys could hang out together . It would be fun , don 't you think ? Oh , yeah . I 'm giddy . There 's a lot of stuff we could do together . You said you were lonely . I got you a friend , a buddy . Where is he gonna stay ? Right here with you . That way , you got a friend . You got a roommate . Friend , roommate . One shot . - Look at him . - Hi , roomie . Hey ! I got an idea . How about " no " ? Doug , he needs space . I 'm gonna step outside- - - Stay here . - lt 's a shock . The idea was for you to work so I 'd have quality time with Laura and the kids . well , so far it 's been low quality time . Look , I just need to get a break so I can work on the house , for one thing . Or maybe sit and think a single thought in quiet ... or maybe play golf once and a while . Hey ! I 've been working since I was 12 years old . - It 's break time . - lt is . And I think that 12-year-oId is saying , " Doug , how about a visit ? - You need time for Doug . " - What a suck ! I 'm not a suck . I don 't know what a suck is . - Let me explain it to you . - Please ! - Come on ! For Doug . - Fine . - There you go ! - Go ahead , screw your life up . - Thank you ! - You 're in way over your head . You know , you are two good-looking guys . I promise I 'll make this up to you . - Start by cloning Laura . - Yeah . Yeah . Start by cIoning- - Can you imagine ? Bye ! Have a good time . I am worried about him . He is uptight . Don 't you think ? - He 'll be all right . - I don 't know . That 's a lot of ribs . is that like a slab or something ? Kids , hurry up . We gotta get going . I 'm gonna be late . - Books , jackets . - I need to get my project . Wait a second. I 'lI get the dishes , and I 'lI drive the kids to school . You take a couple minutes for yourself . Thanks . That 's all right . Look ... the other night at the restaurant ... when I said I wanted you to quit your job ? Forget that whole thing . You 've as much right to work as I do . - You mean it ? - l mean it . I just want you to be happy . When you come home , I 'lI give you a foot rub . - Thanks . - You bet . That 's it . Perfect . Round . really perfectly round . hello ? How 's it going ? Hi ! Fine . Everything 's okay . Making bread . Where are you ? - At the Laker game . - Good for you . I meant to be home sooner , but I had a tremendous urge to stop at the game . Good idea . Have yourself a good time . It won 't happen again . How 's everything going ? - You heard from Two ? - l think Two 's still at work . The guy is a horse ! I promise I 'lI be home as soon as I can . all right . Bye . See you . What ? - What happened ? - Nothing . It 's okay . I just had a terrible dream . - What was it ? - What ? - Your dream ? - I don 't know . I was sleeping . Go back to sleep . Everything will be fine . Don 't worry . - All right ! Don 't push me ! - all right . What was that all about ? - What ? - ln the house ! What 's going on ? - Who won the game ? - Don 't give me " who won the game " ! Don 't worry about who won the game . The Lakers won . Van exei hit a three-pointer . What were you doing in bed with Laura ? What ? Nothing . We were watching TV . Laura said she was sleepy and wanted to go to bed . What was I going to say ? - l 'm going to go sleep over the garage ? - Wait a minute ! What do you mean , " she wanted to go to bed " ? What do you mean , " what do I mean " ? - You know what I mean ! - What do you mean ? - Did you have sex with my wife ? - Whoa ! Did you ? No ! I certainly did not ! Look , here was the plan : We 'lI go to bed together- - which we did . And when she 'd fall asleep , I 'd sneak out . But I dozed off . And nothing happened . She did roll over and kind of brushed me in that general region . - Brushed you ? - I mamboed out of there ! Brushed you in the general region ? She shouldn 't even be in the neighborhood ! He mamboed right out of the region . Geez ! All right ! Listen to me , both of you ! This is the number one rule . This is unbreakable . You can 't even try to bend this rule . Nobody has sex with my wife but me . - talk to him . - Fabulous rule , Doug . Nobody ! No clone nooky . - You 're the man . - Great idea . Original nooky only . - Got it ? - Your department . - You 're clear on the rule , right ? - Yes , sir . Yes , you are . - Got you , loud and clear . - lt 's locked in here . - So did you ? - No ! - Wimp . - Slob . The mambo king . Watch your stern there . Hey , number eight . That 's a boat , not a bathtub . Jesus ! Did you enjoy sailing ? It wasn 't really like sailing . It was more like bumper cars . Say , how about an " I sailed with Walt " T-shirt ? No , thanks . You don 't happen to have any ... " I got a refund from Walt " T-shirts , do you ? - Sorry . - I didn 't think so . I 'd really like to Iearn how to sail . You have anything big enough to take my whole family ... and not end up like Gilligan ? I love that show . Remember when they got stranded with the harlem globetrotters ? That was a good one . And believable too . Ow ! Holy moly ! - What the hell are you doing ? - Geez , Louise ! - How many of you are there ? - Hi , Doug . That 's our brother Doug . And that 's Patty and Beth . These are two girls . We were just dancing . One 's cuter than the next . Are you as much fun as Lance and Rico ? You 're Rico , I 'm guessing . Guess again , pal . Even he can 't tell them apart . Look- - girls , can we have some privacy ? We have to have a little family meeting . - l thought we were gonna have a party . - Wait a minute ! - You 're kidding , right ? - No , I 'm serious . - Maybe some other time . - Nice buzz kill . - Are you a drag , or what ? - I don 't know . Try to keep your voices down when you go out there , okay ? - lt 's important . - Sure . Good night , Lance ! Good night , Rico ! - Nice . - Thanks a lot . The adventures of Lance and Rico . Lance , where did you meet those two bims anyway ? They 're the microwave girls at the A.M. / P.M. mini mart . They work at the store . They 're clerks . well , the slurpee girls were busy , I guess . Look ... I stopped to pick up my dinner like I always do . She offered to nuke my corn dog . What am I gonna say ? No ? So , we came back here and had ourselves a party . They actually happen to be two very nice young women . Yeah , women being the key word here , Dougie . Yeah , right . Look ! You can 't just go out and meet some strangers and bring them up here ! Are we supposed to live like a couple of monks ? He makes a very good point . Damn good point . What are you doing ? What do you mean , what am I doing ? I 'm splitting atoms . I 'm having a smoke . What 's it look like ? I can see you 're having a smoke . What for ? What 's it to you ? I spent a thousand dollars to quit , remember ? That 's what it is . Looks like it didn 't take . Don 't ever blow smoke in my face again . What are you gonna do about it ? I 'Il hit you so hard , I 'lI kill him . Come on , guys . Maybe we oughta sit down and have a rap session . You 're both feeling a Iot of anger , and I 'm afraid you 're like two Iions- - - Shut up . - Shut up . I 'm sorry . Where 's your aspirin ? tylenol , Doug . It 's less abrasive on the stomach . It 's in the kitchen above the cabinet . I 'lI find it . Look at this place. lt 's a mess . I can 't leave you alone for a minute . One , two , three , four . Doug , if I might- - No , wait . One , two , three ... four . Twelve ! - Seven . - Doug , I 'd Iike you to meet Four . I got a wallet ! That guy gave it to me . I 'm gonna drive a car . He 's got a wallet . Come here ! Come here . Where 'd he come from ? He 's gonna help us out around here a bit . Do the day-to-day stuff . Clean the house , mow the lawn , Take out the trash . - bullshit we don 't have time to do . - Forget that . What the hell 's wrong with him ? Nothing . You know , nothing really wrong . You know , he 's a little special . He 's fine . He 'lI be all right . Yeah , he 's special , all right . What we did was we made a copy from Two . You know how sometimes you make a copy of a copy ... it 's not quite as sharp as the original . That 's kind of what happened . Leeds loved it . He loved it because it was very experimental . We got a great deal on him too . Very cheap . Good. I 'm glad Leeds loved it . 'Cause I hate it ! You can 't just go around cloning people ! That 's crazy ! Oh , man ! all right , listen up . Listen really clearly to me . Rule number two . First of all , we all remember rule number one . - No sleeping with your wife . - It 's in here . I got it . AII right . That 's important . rule number two . No more Dougs . That 's it . This is plenty . I 'm gonna call Leeds in the morning . We 're out of the Doug-making business . Store 's closed . Am I clear ? - Yeah . - Am I clear on this ? - Got it . - Book is closed on that one . I Iike pizza . I like it ! We 're gonna need a cage . Bye , Steve . Good party . I like Steve . How 'd it go ? Oh , man , I 'm telling you . This is great . He was fantastic . You want some really great sailing ? Grab Mrs. Doug , get her down here tomorrow morning ... and come to catalina with Robin and me on my big boat . You should think about it . I think you 'd like it . I 'm telling you , we cruise into Avalon Harbor at sunset ... a couple of bottles of champagne on board . We leave you alone . You make love right on the boat . Most romantic thing in the world . Think about Catalina . Yeah , maybe. I 'lI call you . Honey ? May I do that ? would you mind ? - This ? - l just wanna show you something . See , first of all , this piece of aluminum foil ? It 's too small , see ? You can 't cover it all . What 's gonna happen ? Air 's gonna get in there . Then you get that little hard crust around the meat . It gets real brown and dark , and nobody wants to eat that . We 're gonna fold this up and save this . We can use it later . Or , Christmastime comes around , we might make a nice ornament outta that . That 's what I Iike to do . By the way , save those fries . I 'm thinking of stringing them , paint them and string them around the tree . Kids 'll love that . Okay , look here . I 'm gonna take a new , fresh piece . Like so . Right there . Now I 'm gonna fold it up on one side , like that , make sure we 're even . Then , I fold once , I fold twice , or three times- - Whatever you need to fold it . Sometimes people roll it over . I don 't like that . You get that lump across the center ... that rolls around in the fridge . I fold it nice and flat , and no air gets in there . Because air 's our enemy , isn 't it ? Take this , tuck , tuck , fold . T.T.F. : Tuck , tuck , fold . Two tucks and a fold . I just think of elizabeth Taylor . Then I remember a tuck here , a fold there . Makes it simple . Now we roll over , nice and flat . There we go . We got it . No air 's gonna get in there . We could send this little guy off to NASA and nothing would happen . Look here . Put the lid on , burp . There you are . That 's very nice . It 's very nice . Doug , I 've been noticing things about you lately ... and I 'm starting to think that maybe- - What ? Nothing . Go like this . Go- - Can I just do something here ? See what that does ? That just frames you better , and here it gives you height . Honey ... why don 't you go relax and let me finish cleaning up ? Why ? I- - Okay . all right . You sure ? I 'm sure . Freezer . Second shelf , over to the left with all the other meat products ... unless it 's in a skin casing , like your franks and sausages and kielbasa . That goes lower in the bin . Oh , boy ! Man ! That was a great meal , honey . - Great . - You cooked it . Yeah , but , you know , you ate it . Doug , were you wearing that shirt earlier ? This ? Yeah . - I 'm losing it . - Yeah , sure . Dad , watch this . Wow ! Great . Let me show you how to walk the dog . You just showed me before dinner . I did ? Oh , right ! That 's right , I did. I forgot . You guys wanna go out and get some ice cream ? unless we already did . Doug , did you decide ? Did I decide what ? What we 've been talking about . You said you 'd think about it and let me know . I did . I gave it a Iot of thought . I thought about it a lot , babe . What did you think ? Well , you know ... after thinking about it and giving it a lot of thought ... I think whatever you think is probably the smartest thing to do . You 're smart . You have great ideas . please , honey . Don 't put this all on me . They 're your kids too . Can I say something ? I really thing we ought to leave the kids out of this . What do you mean ? You want to go to Disney world without the kids ? No ! I certainly don 't wanna do that . That 's not fair to the kids . Go all the way down there , just you and me riding those rides . It 's stupid . Can I ask you something ? When is it we 're going to Disney World ? Christmas . I bought nonrefundable tickets to Orlando . You bought nonrefundable tickets to Orlando ? Are you nuts ? - You told me to go ahead and buy them . - Not me . - Then who ? - Not me . God , Doug , you 're driving me crazy ! I call the office , and you bite my head off . Other times you 're as sweet as can be . And then one minute you 're obsessing about every little detail . Then the next you seem so completely out of it ... like you don 't even know what I 'm talking about . What 's going on with you ? Nothing 's wrong with me . absolutely nothing 's wrong with me . My God . You could have bipolar disorder or multiple personalities . Hon , let 's sail to Catalina . - What ? - Come on. lt 'Il be great . We 'lI sail right into the harbor at sunset . We 'Il drink some wine . We 'lI make love right on the boat . - It 'lI be great . - Doug , you don 't sail . I drink and I make love . The sailing thing- - l can figure that out . How hard can it be ? - We can 't just go sailing to Catalina . - Why not ? Let 's just be spontaneous . We 'll leave the kids with your parents . We used to do stuff like this . You 're the one who says , " Let 's go down to Ecuador ... and throw harpoons with Peruvian basket people and stuff . " Yeah , but that 's just talk . well , let 's just go . Why can 't we ? Why not ? Why not ? Your job , my job . Jennifer 's dance recital . The Donaldson 's anniversary party . - I 'm not going to the DonaIdsons . - You said you were . - When ? - This morning . When you figure out what you want , would you just let me know ? - hello ? - ln here , Doug . Three ? Can I talk to you for a second ? Sure . - What 's up , Doug ? Everything okay ? - I 've gotta go away for a couple days . - really ? - Yeah , it 's a business trip . - l handle the business . - Yeah , he handles the business , Steve . Okay , fine. lt 's not a business trip . I need to get away by myself and figure some things out . - Do you understand ? - You need to get centered . I understand . That 's a good idea . You deserve that . Thank you . I need to get centered . I need you to cover for me days and nights . Whoa . Nights ? What about rule number one ? Yeah , what about rule number one ? What 's rule number one ? Hey , " Rain Man . " Run back in there and floss yourself , all right ? I already thought of that . rule number one still stands . Do you remember when I had that bronchial infection ? - Oh , sure . That was nasty . - You got it again . Just cough a Iot and tell her you 're really , really sick ... and you don 't want her to catch it , okay ? And keep your distance . Can you handle that ? I 've got a sore throat and a fever . Okay . Hey , Doug , you want me to handle it ? No . Thanks , though . Hey , I 'm just trying to help out . Is he safe with that razor ? Yeah . We take the blade out . Two and I shave him at night while he 's sleeping . It 's cute , I think . all right . - Hey , I 'm counting on you . - Okay , Doug . All right ? - Hey , wait . - Hey , ahoy , Doug . - Where 's your wife ? - She couldn 't make it . Don 't you wanna wait until she can come with you ? You know what ? She 'lI probably come next time . - Then come on aboard . - all right . Great . - Wanna give me a hand with these ? - Sure . I 'm sorry about last night . I understand why you wanted us to go away together . You do ? Good . It did sound romantic , but we don 't have to go away to make love . - Honey . - You all right ? No . I think I 'm really coming down with something here . I 've got a Iot of phlegm . Oh , gee ! I 'm burning up . I think I 've come up with a fever or something . Maybe it 's a better idea if we don 't get too close tonight . - I 'm not worried . - I don 't want you to get sick . I just think maybe- - Hey , you know what ? Maybe if you 'd not do that , 'cause I don 't- - Oh , honey ! It might be a good idea if I just go down and sleep in the den . Just relax . Hey , what do you hear from your parents ? How are they ? I 'm really feeling sick . I 'm gonna make you feel better . I guess you weren 't as sick as you thought . No. I guess not . That was so unusual . I 've never seen you cry like that before . You know- - That one time when the souffle fell ... but besides that , I don 't know , I guess I was just moved by it all . You know what I want now ? No . Graham crackers and chocolate milk . Good . - You want some ? - No , thanks , honey . I 've had plenty . - I 'Il be right back . - Okay . What have I done ? Hey , Mister Wizard . Who ate all the bologna ? BurgIars . What 'd you do , eat everything in the house ? Count ChocuIa ? No , thanks . all right , that 's it . I 'm starving . I 'm sneaking into that house and get something to eat . Oh , Doug ! You startled me . Change your mind ? Yeah , I did . I changed my mind , I think . Want some ? You taste good . You taste pretty good yourself . Remember when we used to make love all over the house ? Oh , yeah . I remember . Boy , am l- - Aren 't you hungry ? You know , I couId- - l don 't know about you ... but I couId go for one of these canned hams . Oh , man ! Wait a minute . I don 't know if this is really , you know ... the worst idea in the world . Oh , wait a minute . Look . I don 't know if we should do this , 'cause I 've got- - Oh , man , I 've got a really bad cough . Of course , it could clear up in a second . - Doug ? - What ? I want you . Wait . I- - I 'm not so sure . Okay . Wait . Grab that . That was athletic . That was better than the Stairmaster . well , I guess I got a little carried away . - You all right ? - Yeah . ShouIdn 't we go back upstairs ? Yeah. I guess . Here . Thanks . Oh , geez , Laura . I almost forgot . There 's some things down here I gotta take care of . Okay , honey . - I 'Il be up in a minute ! - Doug , the kids ! Oh , Doug ! I forgot to shut the windows on the volvo . It 's gonna be soaked . Do you mind ? No problem , hon . I 'Il get it . Sorry about yelling with the kids and everything , honey ! Oh , baby ! You 're drenched ! I 'm so sorry . Come upstairs . What was I thinking ... sending you out in the rain without you feeling good ? Sweetie , you 're soaking . Come on and get out of those wet clothes . My goodness ! You 're just- - Wet . Let me dry you off . I am so sorry . I was so , so selfish . Let me help you with those pants . Wow ! Again ? well . My peppy . I see . well ... so much for rule number one . It was a hell of a ride , wasn 't it ? Maybe we 'Il get the onshore wind tomorrow . That ought to make things a little easier . You really ought to sit up . You 're gonna start feeling sick again . Sorry I hurled on your dog , man . - lt 's okay . Not the first time . - No , thanks . You know , Doug , some people really shouldn 't sail . Yeah , maybe not . That was pretty miserable there for a while . You know , it wasn 't just the getting sick part . When I was down there with my head in the- - well , in the head ... my whole life actually flashed before my eyes . There it was . The funny part is ... I wasn 't in it . I gotta get back into my Iife . I have no idea what the hell you 're talking about . - But good luck to you . - well , thanks . One-o-three ? You 're not going anywhere today , Mr. flu Bug . - You 're not going anywhere , Steve . - I gotta go . The building inspector 's coming today . You 're too sick to go anywhere . I just won 't- - del King . Del ? Hi , it 's Doug . How you doing ? well , not too good as it turns out . I don 't think I can make it in today . Why don 't you just reach down my throat and pull out my liver ? Gee , Del . Being a little dramatic , aren 't you ? If we don 't get inspected today that guy won 't be back for a month ! I understand . But I 'm really , really just under the weather here . Can 't you get someone else to meet him ? Nobody knows this job like you do . Look . Stop screwing around , get your ass down there or start looking for another job ! Nice attitude , Del . - He said- - - Yeah , I heard him . I gotta get down there . - You can 't go . - I gotta go . - Maybe I 'Il just lay down for a while . - You 're not going anywhere . Four , take care of him . I 'm going to work . Sorry , Steve . That leg 's gonna have to come off . All right . These are the water pipes . And you 've got hot and cold both available in all the units . Which is really , you know , really nice . What is this ? This looks like- - And it is . It 's the gas line . That 's gonna be your gas line ... which would feed natural gas to all the appliances ... which would require natural gas . You 're not answering the inspector 's question . I 'm sorry . What was the question ? The plan showed two-inch gas lines- - Whoa . Go like this . Go- - Right here . You go something . That 's it . You got it . You had a little something- - l wanna know why you only went with one-inch . Oh , that 's right . I remember . So what 's the answer ? Can you excuse me ? - What ? - Hi . Why did you use one-inch gas lines instead of two ? 'Cause- - Knock it off ! Because the original calcs were based on kitchens with two ovens . King cut it back to one to save money . Got it . I remember . I remember now . The original plans called for two ovens . Somebody decided to cut back to just the one . To save money , I guess . I don 't know about you fellas ... but I personally like a double oven . Sure , there 's a Iot of bending . But if you got a turkey in the bottom and maybe some rutabaga or something- - I don 't know , anything cooking on the top . It 's nice if you Iike to entertain , which I do . But you 're still stubbed out for two . What if some future occupant decides to put in a second oven ? WeIl- - You hate me ? I don 't know . - hold on a second . - This is ridiculous . - Wait . - The guy can 't answer ... a few simple questions about a job ? Running off into another room every two minutes . - You know what that usually means ? - alcohol and drugs . God knows what he 's been doing on the job here . all right . Here 's how it works . Even with the extra demand of the oven ... we took the laundry rooms off this line and ran a separate line down the back . Which line is feeding the gas fireplaces now ? Thinking . Boy , does he ask some tough ones . That 's it ! This guy doesn 't know what he 's doing ! Wait a second there , mister . You 're entitled to your opinion ... but I don 't think it 's fair to judge anyone ... based on one very superficial conversation . Do you , Del ? I 'm notifying the building commissioner . - No ! - Kinney . Doug Kinney . You will stop all work right where it is until further notice . I 'Il be back in about three weeks . I suggest you get your act together if you wanna keep your license . - Three weeks ? - And get that man some help . You what ? You got fired ? Just come home . Doug , what are you doing home ? - Are you sick ? - Yeah . We got any Pepto-BismoI ? - What about your big inspection ? - My big inspection . well , I guess I missed it , didn 't I ? I thought it was so important . I rearranged everything so you could go . So , Laura , what are you , some kind of saint ? What do you want me to do , give you a medal ? That makes me feel better . I guess you 've been under a Iot of pressure lately . But when you talk to me like that , I think you mean it ... and it hurts me . Now , something is happening lately ... and I feel like I don 't know you anymore . And it scares me , Doug . You know ... you go along day after day ... and you tell yourself that your problems aren 't serious . They 're normal . They happen to everyone . Or you hope that they 'Il just go away by themselves . But they don 't . It 's like this house . You always said you would fix it up . No matter what it was , " l 'lI fix it , " you said . But nothing ever gets fixed . I need to know what you 're feeling . I need to know if you still love me . Doug , please , just tell me what you want . I want pizza . What ? I want pizza . Give me some pizza . Take it easy . Thanks for sailing with us . Good-bye . Watch your step . Are you guys crazy ? What are you doing ? What if Laura walks in ? - Not much chance of that , sport . - Yeah , not much chance of that , Rick . Where is she ? She left you . What ? Yeah , nothing but taiIlights . She 's gone , Doug . I 'm sorry . She took the kids , packed her bags and went to her mother 's . They 're in Palm Springs . Doug , I 'm so sorry . Do you want something to eat ? Forget that ! Wait a minute ! What happened with Laura ? We had a fight . You had a- - What are you even talking to her for ? It 's complicated . I was pissed off over getting fired . You got fired ? I didn 't . He did . You 've been doing this for ten years . You can 't answer a few simple , basic questions ? - Simple questions ? - Yeah , simple . - lt was like being on " Jeopardy " ! - These are basic instructions . They were grilling me . You did nothing to specifications . Knock it off ! - Dick . - Puke-face . Did you bring me a monkey ? Oh , man . There 's something else I think you should know . What ? well ... it 's about rule number one . What about rule number one ? well , crazy thing . We had to bend it a little . I 'd say we bent it a Iot . Damn near broke the thing off . Did you sleep with my wife ? - Hey , Iet 's have some rice cakes and- - - Did you ? I 'm sorry , Doug . She 's a powerful woman . Hey ! Take it easy ! - She thought he was you . - She did , Doug . The fact is ... she thought I was you too . What ? Hey , we 're not perfect . I don 't believe this . I leave you guys alone for one day- - and you totally destroy my Iife . We didn 't destroy your life , slick . You did . As a matter of fact , we were trying to save it for you . We were doing pretty good too . We just had one bad day . One really bad day . We tried , Doug . We really did . It was a nightmare . She was unstoppable . It was unbelievable . She couldn 't get sat- - She touched my peppy , Steve . I don 't understand this . We 've had fights before , but- - Why did she leave ? You don 't fix stuff . What ? You always say you 're gonna fix stuff , and then you don 't fix stuff . Did Laura say that ? Maybe . Did you talk to Laura before she left ? Maybe . I don 't remember . Maybe this will refresh your memory . Where do you put all that stuff ? Did you ? Come on . Talk to me . Did she tell you something ? She talked to me a Iot . She was afraid , and she cried . Oh , geez . She cried ? She cried because ... I don 't fix anything . She 's scared . Oh , man . She 's scared . Hey , I 'm gonna buy you a present for this . A chain saw ? Or a book . Something really nice. I promise . Come on up . I 'm spitting on bugs . - What 's going on ? - I need you guys to help me . - What are you doing , Doug ? - Putting my life back together . Come on . Let 's go . - About time . - Poly blend . WelI- - - Hey , Steve , can I help ? - Grab me that plastic , would you ? - Good morning , Vic . - Doug . You said to be here at 8 : 30 . I 'd Iike you to note the time . - 9 : 15 . - What ? What the hell 's the matter with- - This thing drives me nuts ! That 's all right . Come on . Hey , look . I just wanna tell you I 'm sorry I spoke to you the way I did . I still think you 're the best cement man in the business . - really ? - No , but I gotta get this done ... and no one else is available . well , I can accept that . You got your own guys ? Yep . - Okay . Let 's go to work . - Fair enough . Wow ! Okay ! You heard him ! I made some real tasty sandwiches if you want one . Oh , great . Tuna with curried mayonnaise . Ooh , I like that . I know . That 's why I made them . - Let me ask you something . - Sure . You know the other night ... when you were- - when you were with Laura ? Doug , I 'Il tell you something .

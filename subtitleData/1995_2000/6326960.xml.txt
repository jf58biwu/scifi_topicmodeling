Always has been and always will be . - Elias . - What ? The intention was to have a summit discussion . - About how to get out of here . - Yes . You know there is no way of escape .

Who cares ? I trust them . Let 's go ! You were using . You were picked up from the streets and brought here for experiments . You 've accepted and how well you were able to survive . You have created their own teams , own slang ... Boring ! Let him finish . I want to warn you happen to what happened to Garry . We gotta get out of here , all in a secure environment - And to repair the damage done . - What damage ? I feel good . Peter told me the legend that sometimes come strangers and get her some of you . This means that somewhere in the park , there is a portal . We can find a way out , but if you still continue to bat we will never . We must join forces . - Never ! - Listen . What do you know ? You 're just a girl . - Withdraw your words or charged . - Hey , take it easy . - What ? - I want you out of here . - You 're lying ! Thee afraid . - Wait . - Wait , the adult 's right . - What ? I was here when they found the garage and the story is that Garry stranger to left in the garage . Need to work together if we get out of here ... - Shut up , Henry ! - No , listen ...

I want to go home . - We 'll find a way . - Back ! Flinch - Henry , put the gun down . Elias thought I was weak , but I 'm strong . - From now on , I decide . - Henry , put the gun down !

A lot of blue crossed our side when I took the gun . - We rest a while . Plenty of time . - On the contrary . I think you should send team immediately . What ? I ran to the coaster , but the adult is able to organize an attack - To regain gun . - We have guards . - You 're an idiot . - What did you say ? The adult is smart enough to pass the guards when he wills . You made idiot . Now we have in abundance , but we have to think about tomorrow . Source of food you expect something more than happened today . Not have to disappoint . - We must attack them Peter and adult . - Why ? I have a gun . Let 's use . The adult will not be easy to kill . E flesh . - I say stick . - I do not care what you say . - We have to go in the garage . - Not until you kill Henry . Tit for Tat , right ? I had the opportunity to explore the room . There is a way out . If I let him beat punk , Dawn would still be alive . Henry beat him , he 'll beat you . Soon we will all be dead . - When will it end ? - I do not care about anyone else . I cared about Dawn . Come on , Peter , to look in the garage . They have my gun . There you are . Hands up ! Hands up , or you 're dead ! Move . - Can we leave here , Henry . - You heard . Move it ! We demand food source , We reward for killing adult . - That would be great . - Yes , a bloody party .

It 's time for the real world . Du-te . It looks like a war zone leaves the band . Take care of them . - Foster , thank God you 're okay . - I found the children , Eddie . - I know I do , Gua . - Let 's get the hell out . Since you are here , guard thinks I 'm crazy . Imagine what we can do with these children . We can tell their own stories , Eddie . Take grub . Eat , guys ! Let 's go . Move it ! A ! - Hey , hey ! Let me go , Eddie ! - You will be arrested , Foster . But children ... If you get arrested , you will not do anyone any good . If ! I know that revenge can be overcome . Peter had the power to renounce violence , in part because I promised a better life in the outside world . I wish I could keep my promise . Post by aliens . Have you wasted your time with this experiment . No need for a source of food that we turn children into monsters . Ourselves , we are doing quite well . Translation and adaptation Florin ( c ) thin

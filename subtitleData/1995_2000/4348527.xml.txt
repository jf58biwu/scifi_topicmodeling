 You don 't know what that means , do you ? " Go back to the abyss " ? " I banish thee to the abyss for thee prepared . " Your Latin is pitiful . When I was 15 , I wanted to be an archaeologist , and I stuck to it . I could read and write Latin , ancient Hebrew and Greek . And I guess that about makes you God , doesn 't it ? " Faith has need of the whole truth . " Professor Washburn said that you shouldn 't be doing this alone and that the boxes you were looking for were more powerful than you think . I know exactly how powerful they are . To kill a snake , you must cut off its head . Never forget that , Derek . And it 's supposed to contain the souls of demons . I have to think of The Legacy . I cannot let my colleagues down . What about letting me down ? This is supposed to be my holiday . You said we 'd spend time together . I don 't believe you anymore . What the hell are you doing ? Wait right here . Do you understand ? Hey ! Darkness and light , good and evil the same eternal balance . Father ? Burying something this powerful is like damming a river with stones . Somehow , the river finds its way . - What are you doing ? - I need to find the whole truth . Don 't ! No ! Dad , let 's get out of here . Let 's go . Come on , take my hand . Dad ... Dad ! Dad ! Dad . Dad . Dad ! Dad ! No ! Derek , the key ! The key ! Dad , no ! The key ! Derek , I 'm so sorry . I can get you out of here . Don 't do this , Father . The burden is yours now . The ledge was just about halfway ... Halfway down a waterfall and behind it . - That 's where the statue was . - How did you reach it ? We stretched a cable across the river clipped a descender rig to it , and I tossed myself over . It was about 500 feet to the bottom . Nasty drop . Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention , please ? May we all just move into the other room for a quick announcement ? That includes you too , Nick . You can tell me the end of the story . I 'm sure it gets better every moment . You know , it 's just not quite the same . You were there . That 's right . As I remember , I saved your ass . - Is that how it went ? - Ladies and gentlemen it 's my pleasure to introduce the chairman of the Luna Foundation and our host , Dr. Derek Rayne . Thank you , Alex . Thank you . My father , Winston Rayne , the founder of the Luna Foundation has a motto written in stained glass in the library upstairs : " Faith has need of the whole truth . " It was in search of this truth that he lost his life in a cave-in , some 27 years ago , this very night . My father established the Luna Foundation in the hope that the artifacts we recovered from around the globe would someday find a way to enrich all our lives . So tonight , I take great pride in donating this 13th-century Madonna and Child . - A toast to the memory of my father . - A toast . Whose legacy will be with us always . - Hear , hear . - To your father . Hear , hear . The key ! The key ! Dad , no ! - Derek ? - Get the others . Quickly . Oh , computers . Derek ? Derek ? What 's going on ? At the reception , I had a premonition of a little girl in a graveyard . And just a short while ago , I had another one of a primitive wooden chest , a sepulcher . Sepulcher ? I 'm trying to search my father 's dossier . Could you please help me and cross-reference it with anything like Gaelic crosses cemetery by the sea , perhaps a small village ? Sure , but why your father 's dossier ? - Derek ? - Just do it . What 's going on ? Yeah , follow me . There 's work to do . I 've told everyone my father died accidentally . In a cave-in , right ? That was a lie . It was no accident . - How long has this been here ? - Just pay attention . My father died searching for these . Now , you must understand what these boxes represent . In the ancient scriptures God appointed five of his most trusted angels to watch over the affairs of man . Yeah . The Watchers who fell from grace . Exactly . Nick , can you help me to open that crate ? Yeah . Here . Five fallen angels who wreaked havoc by mating with the very women they were supposed to protect . It was the Druids who finally subdued and imprisoned them in these chests . You said there were five chests . There 's only four here . My father died in vain retrieving this one . And after that , the burden of finding the others fell to me . I 've spent all my life uncovering three more . But to destroy them , you need all five together . And tonight ... Tonight I had a vision of the missing one . - Derek ? - In here . Oh , my God . To raise true evil into the world you must position these chests in the shape of a pentagram with two points ascending like horns . And you can call up Satan . Then everything depends on who controls the sepulcher . God only knows what will happen . So , what did you find ? The cemetery and Gaelic symbols coincided with an accident that happened two days ago . Five amateur archaeologists were found killed in a cave-in . - Where ? - Ireland . I knew it was true . I knew it . So this is where your brother is and here 's Daddy . Do you want to put your flowers down now for him ? You 're the widow , huh ? Yes . You wouldn 't remember me from the funeral , but I remember you . And them . The Americans , father and son . What was it that happened to them ? A car accident back home in California . Aye , about a year ago , wasn 't it ? That 's right . Long way to lay a soul to rest . It was my husband 's wish that he be buried here where he was born . How long do you plan on staying ? - Pardon ? - I 'm only warning you out of obligation . You see these five graves I 've just dug ? Fools climbing in caves . Spelunkers they call themselves . Roof came down on them not more than 10 miles from here . What killed them was the devil himself . That 's who they went looking for . That 's who they found . So I wouldn 't stay a moment longer than you have to . That 's all I have to say about it . He 's a funny man , huh ? Katherine , it 's me , Connor . I 'm over here . My sweet boy . Connor ? My condolences to you both . Katherine . Thank you . The least I can do is to keep their resting place clean and proper . This is a really old picture , but it 's my favorite . That 's Patrick , and this is Connor . I 'm sorry . It just kind of sneaks up on you sometimes . He looks just like you . Same devil in his eyes . Handsome little fellow . Thank you . I 'm afraid I spoiled him rotten , though . Just like Katherine . Katherine ? Kat ? Katherine ? She was there just a moment ago . Katherine ! Nothing but trouble . Katherine ! Katherine ! Katherine ! Excuse me , ma 'am , over here . I suspect the little one you 're looking for is inside . - Katherine ? - It was a sight . She ran straight to it . Thank you . Such a lovely child . I figured you had to be the mother . Katherine . Katherine Corrigan , you scared me half to death . What do you think you 're doing ? He told me to come . - Who ? - Connor . Sweetie , Connor 's gone . I know , but it reminds me of Connor . What ? This ? It 's like the box me and Connor kept our secret treasure in . That was an old shoe box . I should put you right over my knee right now . Excuse me , sir , how much is this ? - I 'm sorry ? - This old box here , how much ? She 's got great taste there . I 've only just procured it , but it 's obviously quite old and it 's very precious . I can see that , the way you had it prominently displayed and all . I 'll give you 20 American . Oh , no , no . I think it 's probably worth 100 easy . I don 't know . Doesn 't even have a key . Well , you 'd never buy it if it doesn 't have a key . Key ... There 's the key to my heart . Let 's try this one , then . You 've got to be delicate with these old things because they 're ... You can destroy the patina so easily . Here , no harm done . Now , that 's workmanship , see ? It 's a hell of a lock too . Tell you what , I 'll give you $ 30 now . I 'm at the inn for the next two days . If you find the key , I 'll give you another 30 . Punts . - You drive a hard bargain , Mr ? - Bloom . Shamus Bloom . And you 're ? - Rachel Corrigan . - Pleasure . This is my daughter , Katherine . There you go , love . A box for your treasures . - Careful with that . - I am , Mom . - Bye . Thank you . - Thank you . You 're not exactly dressed for Mass , Father . No , actually I just came in to apologize for my rather sinful behavior on the playing fields . But you 're not here to talk about soccer , are you ? No . No , I 'm not . The Legacy needs you . The Legacy has fought evil for 3000 years without my help . I don 't see why suddenly they need my help now . The fifth sepulcher has been found . - Where ? - Ireland . The Druids hid the last one in their own back yard ? They fooled us , didn 't they ? I 'll pray for you , my friend . - Come with us . - No . You are a member of The Legacy . I was . Not anymore . What about the people you care for ? I saw what this evil can do if it gets released into the world . It 's a battle we could lose . You 're far too obstinate to let that happen . That 's your strength . Derek . Watch out for Nick . He has no respect for the forces he 's up against . That 's his strength , my friend . Oh , listen . Derek said he 's gonna be a few minutes late . Yeah , where did he go ? - Philip . - Nick , come on . He 's not coming back . - I wanna go with you . - No , I need you here . When we secure the fifth sepulcher , we 'll be back . You 're sure there 's only five ? Five form a pentagram , and that 's the Watchers ' dream . All right . As long as we control these keys , the sepulchers are safe . Now , if anything should happen to any of us ... Yeah , I know , swallow the key . Kidding , kidding . - Is Philip coming ? - No . - Be careful . - Yeah . Go to the vaults . Bring up the other sepulchers . Maybe there 's something we 've missed . Right . Dear Grandma , Connemara is very pretty . I want to go home now . Good printing . And time for bed . Come on , Mr. Bear , in we go . Are you sad , Mom ? A little . I miss your daddy and your brother very , very much . I keep wishing they were still with us . I guess I thought coming here would help me let go . - Are you sad ? - A little . It 's okay to be a little sad , right ? Right . - Night , Mom . - Sleep tight . Good night , Connor . I miss you . - You found it . - That 's right . - Mommy , he found the key ! - He did ? Well , isn 't that fabulous ? Okay , now open that box up and put it on the bed . Now , I believe , what , the bargain we struck was another 30 punts ? No , ma 'am . - What do you mean , " no " ? - No , I mean I can 't take your money . After seeing the look on your daughter 's face , I just ... You know . The truth is , it was among the few possessions of an unfortunate spelunker . It hadn 't been in the shop a moment when she came in . It must be special to her . That 's very sweet of you . Katherine and I were about to have our afternoon tea . Care to join us ? - I could murder a cup of tea . - There you are . Okay , Katherine . Two minutes , in my room , okay ? It 's not disturbing your husband and you , is it ? Oh , no . My husband passed away last year . Oh , I 'm terribly sorry . In fact , that 's sort of the reason that Katherine and I are here . It 's a kind of pilgrimage . Come on . - Tea 's on . - Right . Come on , Katherine . Hurry up . Come on , Katherine . - It 's stuck . - Katherine , hurry it up . No , no , no , I 'm not that kind of doctor . I 'm a psychiatrist . We could drum up some business for you in this town , I think . Hurry up , Katherine . Just get me out oh here . - Katherine ! - Stop it . Just stop it . Katherine ? - What is going on in here ? - He 's yelling at me . - Who is ? - Connor . I 'm trying to open it , but it 's stuck . Well , let me help you . I 'll tell you what . You know , a lock this old will seize up on you . Why don 't I take it back to my shop . No , Connor says I have to do it . A child 's imagination . I 'll loosen this lock up , I 'll buff it up nice and I 'll pop it right back to you . What do you say ? - Say thank you . - Thank you . You 're very kind . Well , you know , the Irish . I 'll find the cemetery . It must be close . Nick , check us in . Julia , find out if someone 's seen the chest or a small girl with a red coat . - We 'll meet in two hours at the pub . - At the pub . - How do you know there 's a pub ? - We 're in Ireland , Nick . Right . Don 't worry about me . I 'll take care of this stuff . Let 's see . Have a look here . All right , now . Let 's have a go . Come on , you ... Come on , you little devil . I 'll not take no for an answer . All right . Howdy . - Any chance of a beer ? - Not here . - One of those Americans . - I guess not . Okay , I 'm looking for a chest . It 's old , it 's wooden , it 's got writing on the side . The foundation I work for is willing to spend a lot of money to retrieve it . Lovey , do we have any of them old wooden chests in the backroom with the old writing on them ? I guess not . Whatever it is you 're looking for , mister , we don 't have it . Now , if I was you , I 'd be taking my leave of Connemara . Have a nice day . Those men who died they were looking for a small wooden chest . - I know what it was . - Good . Because I 'm not leaving this town until I have it . Then you 're as great a fool as they were . Whatever it was they found in that cave I 've not felt it before , but I know what it is . It 's evil , and it has been let loose . - Where ? - I don 't know . Please let me talk to the parish priest . Maybe he knows something that can help me . Aye , Father Kernan could help until three days ago , when he died in that cave with four other fools . You 're too late , mister . Too late . Hello ? Hello ? Excuse me ? Are you open ? - We 're closed . - I 'm sorry . The door was open , so I just walked in . That 's it . That 's what I 'm looking for . Isn 't it grand to suddenly find what you 've been wanting for so long ? I know exactly how you feel . That 's a lovely thing , isn 't it ? - Hello ? - Alex . I tried to reach Derek , but my phone doesn 't work . If Derek calls , tell him I 've found the fifth chest . - Where ? - It 's in an antiques shop . Alex , I saw it . I gotta go . Julia ? Oh , my ... The number you have reached is not in service . Excuse me , ma 'am . - Where 's Julia ? - Isn 't she inside ? - No , I thought she was with you . - No . Come on , let 's get inside . Come on ! I 'll tell you a secret . Sometimes , just sometimes I feel like your daddy 's with me . And then something will happen that 'll remind me of Daddy and Connor and I 'm sure I can hear their voices and their laughter . Wouldn 't it be great if Connor could come back ? There 's nothing that I would like better than to see him again . If he 's an angel , he 'll be able to fly back home , right ? Absolutely . Okay , into bed . Spit spot . Sleep tight and dream of angels . Alex said Julia went to an antiques store . - I 'd hoped she 'd be here . - Shouldn 't have split us up . - Let 's just worry about finding her . - Should have stayed together . Is she sleeping ? I just put her down . Did you fix it ? - It took a bit of tinkering , but I did . - She 's gonna be so happy . Would you like to try it ? It 's quite something . It 's certainly more than you bargained for . Rachel ... - That 's your husband ? - Yes . Patrick . Patrick . Rachel . - Is it you ? - Don 't be afraid . I 'm here . I don 't understand . Your love brought me back . But is it really you ? Don 't be afraid . I 've come to bring your son back to you . It 's been so long . Patrick . Patrick . Mommy ? Help ! Somebody 's hurting my mommy ! Here , watch the child . You ! Stop ! No ! Damn you ! Damn you ! No ! " Whosoever will save his own life , shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it . For what is a man advantaged if he gains the whole world and loses himself or be cast away ? " There are few things in this world of which I 'm certain . But for every darkness in life , there 's light . For every evil , there 's good . That there is a God in heaven and our dear friend Julia Walker has earned a place by his side . We have to learn what happened in that room before we arrived . That 's why I decided to bring Rachel here to recover . Philip , we have to help her . The Legacy battles evil in every form it can take . We know it 's out there . It 's a part of the mortal world . What I 'm trying to say is , if I 've learned anything I 've learned that the last battleground must be here . But it 's a war after all . In your short time with The Legacy , you must have learned that . But on the final day , when we stand before our maker surely the most important victory is here . - Victory over doubt , over fear , over ... - Temptation ? My friend , you 'd forgive the devil if he came to you for absolution but you won 't forgive yourself . Julia sacrificed her life trying to keep this from the dark side . It 's yours now . - What can I do ? - Nick could use some help . Philip . Welcome back to The Legacy . The Legacy member who leaves the house can never return . I thought those were the rules . So they are , but in spirit he never really left . His spirit 's not much good to us without his body , is it ? What if Philip decides to turn his back on us again ? And what if we decide to turn our backs on him ? You understand what it 's like to lose someone , don 't you , Katherine ? Well , Julia was my best friend in the whole world . Good morning , Rachel . I hope Sister Margaret was good company . She can 't hear you , you know . Oh , I think she can . Still asleep ? I need to borrow Katherine for a few minutes . - Katherine , I want you to wear this . - Why ? It will help your mother . Let me try to explain . You have a special gift , a strength that not very many people have . - What kind of strength ? - Innocence . As we get older , Katherine it 's hard not to do or say something we regret . Something we are ashamed of . A weakness . Now , the evil that 's killed my friend and hurt your mother cannot find its way into an innocent soul . No matter how hard it tries , it needs to find a weakness . - It can 't hurt me ? - Right . It can 't hurt you . It can never ever take this key away from you , and that is a promise . I 'll be right back , Rachel . Still fighting fire with fire , huh ? Still pretending to be a priest ? If I could trade places with Julia , I would . - Talk 's cheap . - I can 't change what happened , Nick . I need to read the inscriptions on this chest . Can I take it out of here ? I 'm going to bring your son back to you . Oh , yes . - So this is your job ? - You can say that . My dad was an architect . - Oh , really ? - Yeah . Okay . Very quiet . I 'm gonna tell my mom about the key , okay ? She can hear me even though she 's asleep , right ? Right . I 'll see you in a minute . - Okay . Bye , Derek . - Bye . Mommy , guess how strong ... Katherine , they can 't know . But you 're ... Yes . Everything 's gonna be fine . Daddy came to me , honey , and we 're gonna be a family again . You , me and Connor . It 's gonna be just like it used to be . - It is ? - Yes . But first we have to get away from these people because they don 't want that to happen . They 're gonna try and stop us from becoming a family again . Do you understand ? Okay . Okay . Yes , okay . So you go get your jacket . Leave everything else , all right ? Okay . I 'm sorry , I can 't let you leave . You are not well , Rachel . - Who are you ? - My name is Derek Rayne . You 've been brought to my home in San Francisco . What ? You 've no right to bring me anywhere . Katherine , we 're getting out of here . - But , Mom , they 're really nice . - Now ! Two nights ago , in the village of Connemara you were attacked . Listen to me ! It wasn 't Shamus Bloom who came to you . Don 't you touch me . - You 're on an island . You can 't run . - This is kidnapping . - I 'm going to the police . - Something happened that night . I don 't know what you 're talking about . - You 're putting your life in danger . - Mommy , you 're hurting my arm ! Well , it 's my life , and this is my daughter ! Mommy ! Mommy , are you okay ? Oh , my God . She 's pregnant . I thought I killed it . What I saw in Rachel 's room wasn 't human , but I killed it . What you shot was no longer a demon . It had already left its own legacy with Rachel . All right , everyone . That fits in perfectly with what I 've deciphered from the fifth sepulcher . The fifth is like a Rosetta stone . It talks of a living demon , born into the world that would unleash the demons from the other four sepulchers . - Can we abort it ? - No . Not without risking the mother 's life . Once born of flesh , the demon can assume any shape it wishes . It will search your souls , zero in on weaknesses and try and get our keys . If it gets all five keys and the five sepulchers are placed unlocked in a circle it opens a gateway for its brethren . Great , we got ourselves an express elevator to hell . Now , how do we kill this thing ? This creature expends tremendous energy when it takes over someone 's body . But on that precise moment , that 's when it 's most vulnerable . What do we got , two days before this baby 's born ? No , we 're talking about hours . I mean , this thing is growing at an unbelievable rate . Well , we 've got to find a solution . We 've got to find it now . I could take the chopper up and dump the boxes off the coast . No , it won 't work . We need the sepulchers to trap the demon again . It 's what they were created for in the first place . I made a terrible mistake . I should have known when I tried to take Julia 's key . The demon wanted to come here all along , and it has found a way . Philip , you and Alex pull up the ancient texts from the archive see if there 's any mention of an incantation or the demon 's name . Nick , fly Katherine off the island . Her safety should be our first priority . - And what about you ? - I 'll stay with Rachel for the birth . I owe her that much , and I 've faced this evil once before . Yes , when it killed your father . Let 's get to work . Love you . You can fight harder . Play safe . Let 's go , kiddo . We gotta fly . Rachel . I 'll get you some ice . This symbol could be the name of the demon itself . Okay , well , I 'll initiate a data search . Connor . Oh , dear God . Let 's go , honey . Mommy ! - It did that . - Come on . Let 's get in there . - I 'm locked out . - Maybe it 's just the generator . - Be careful . - Don 't worry . I 'm a saint , not a martyr . Kat ? Kat ! Kat ! Philip . Hello , my love . Oh , my God . I 've just come from the most beautiful swim in the ocean . Ellen ? Just like the night we swam together our bodies moving weightless underneath the stars . I can 't believe you 're here . That night you hurt me more than I thought was possible . After we made love ... You came running here after you broke your vows . Choosing him over me . Oh , God . I was weak . You were a man . If your spirit were only as willing as your flesh ... Oh , sweet Jesus . ... we 'd still be together . - Yes . Yes . - Forever , you and I. Instead , I swam into the ocean as far as I could until I was too weak to hold my head above water . I tried to scream , to call for you . My mouth filled underwater . - It was so black and cold . - Forgive me ! Sweet Jesus ! Alex . Alex . Alex . Alex . Julia ? You could 've saved me , but you didn 't come . Don 't do this . Don 't do this to me . She was my friend . Look what he did to me . You should have come to Ireland , Alex . Why weren 't you there ? I 'm sorry . I thought you were my friend . I am your friend . Oh , God . Forgive me , please . Please forgive me . Please . Kat ? Come on , honey , where are you ? Kat ! Kat ! Mommy ! You are mine ! Oh , God . Forgive me , honey . Hello , son . Did I not teach you that to live by the sword is to die by the sword ? - You 're not my father . - Look again . Same face . Same voice . You have no power over me . - It 's power that I offer , Derek . - I want nothing from you . Don 't reject me . We were wrong . All this time , fighting the wrong battles . That 's a lie ! This would not be the first time that a Legacy house swears allegiance to what is right . Embraces the truth , as I have . My father knew the truth , and you 're not him . Derek , you know I 'm right . It 's the only way . Be at my side . Together , we can herald the coming of the eternal night . Give me the key , son . Join your father . Embrace the darkness . You 're not my father ! How could you do this to me ? Please give me the key . Forgive me . You 're forgiven . Please , somebody open the door ! Help ! Please ! Open the door , please ! Mommy ! Mom ! Mom ! Mommy ! - Rachel ! - Mom ! Oh , Katherine , thank God . Give me the key , Kat . You 're not Connor ! My brother 's dead ! Katherine , give Connor the key . He 's poisoned her with lies about me , Mother . Give it to me now ! I 'm stronger than you ! You can 't hurt me ! Katherine , Connor needs the key . No ! Open your eyes , Rachel . It 's not your son . Liar ! He 's not lying ! He 's telling the truth ! - I want that key . - You stay away from her . Alex ! - The key ! I lost the key ! - Nick ! Come on ! They 're up on the roof . All right , Katherine , give Mommy the key . - I can 't . - It 's all right , I promise . You must give it to me . Please . Yes . Good . Good . - Now , give it to me , Mother . - No . - What are you doing ? Give it to me . - You are not my son . My Connor is in heaven . Give me that key , bitch ! Mommy ! - Mommy ! - No ! Rachel ! No ! Mommy . Don 't let me die . Oh , my God . Oh , baby . It 's all right now . Your key ! No ! I 've got it ! Its name is Azazel ! If we call out his name , maybe we can stop it . Move it ! Derek ! His name is Azazel ! - No ! - Azazel ! Oh , my God . The keys . Turn the keys . Azazel , be gone ! - Is it over ? - I think so .

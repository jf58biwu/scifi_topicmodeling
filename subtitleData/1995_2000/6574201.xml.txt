 We 've exhausted medical and scientific evidence . Nothing we can find - no disease , no hint of disease , only symptoms . The fact is he 's experiencing so much activity in his temporal lobe , it is effectively destroying his brain . Enough . There 's only so much bluntness a mother can take . - Sorry . I just ... - All you do is sedate him . You 're turning him ... into a zombie . I know you can hear me . Fox . - Can you give me a sign ? - I can hear you , Mom . - Fox . - Mom , I can hear you . I 'm here . - I love you , my darling boy . - Mom , where you going ? Mom ! Mom ! Come back , Morn ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! " When in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes ... " Ah , but your mummy 'll still love you . All a mother wants is to shield her boy from pain and danger . Safe in the world as he was once in the womb . But maybe we think a father demands more than mere survival . Maybe we 're afraid a father demands worldly adulation , success , heroism ... I know you can hear me . I could always hear you . Even when my mind is jammed with a thousand voices , I can hear you like a snake hissing underneath . How the hell did you get in here ? How does anything I do surprise you now ? Aren 't you expecting me to sprout vampire fangs ? You 've come to kill me . Be better than living like a zombie , wouldn 't it ? I 'm giving you a choice . - What choice ? - Life or death . Your account is squared - with me , with God , with the IRS , with the FBI . - Rise out of your bed and come with me . - I 'm dying , you idiot . If I could get up . I 'd kick your ass . Don 't be so dramatic . Only part of you is dying . The part that played the hero . You 've suffered enough . For the X-Files , for your partner , for the world . You 're not Christ . You 're not Prince Hamlet . You 're not even Ralph Nader . You can walk outta this hospital and the world will forget you . Arise . What ... what the hell are you doing to me ? I 'm showing you how to take the road not taken . Take my hand . - Why should I take your hand ? - You can 't read my mind ? No . I can 't . All the voices are gone . Take my hand , Fox . You have to take the first step . Take my hand . I 'm your father . Sleep is a luxury , a self-indulgence we have no time for . Nor does Agent Mulder . How did you get in here ? Getting in is easy . It 's what you do once you 're inside that 's key . What 's that supposed to mean ? You are the only one with access to Mulder . I need you to use it wisely . Like you ? Almost killing him by filling him with phenytoin for a moment of lucidity ? It 's what Agent Mulder wanted . He knows what 's wrong . What he wants now is to prove it . It 's why he asked for me , not you . I don 't believe that . Two years ago your partner was infected with a virus he claimed was alien . A virus reactivated in him by exposure to a source of energy also alien . Agent Mulder is living proof of what he tried so long to substantiate : the existence of alien life . Well , whatever it is , it 's killing him . And we have to get it out of him . You destroy this and I 'll destroy you . - Scully . - You need to go to the hospital . - Why ? What happened ? - Mulder 's gone . He 's disappeared . There were guards posted here . A man who 's gravely ill doesn 't just get up and disappear . - I know , I know . - How did this happen ? His mother checked him out . - His mother ? - That 's what they 're saying . Has anybody spoken with her ? I 'm leaving that to you . It 's better I not be involved any further in this case . Sir , this isn 't just a case . This is Agent Mulder we 're speaking about . And I 'm trying to help him by staying out of this from now on . Sir . I 'm in a compromised position . The less I know about Agent Mulder 's whereabouts , and yours , the better . The child is father to the man . You 've been asleep quite a while . I expect it 'll be some time before your sleep patterns return to normal . Would you like an explanation ? I 'm not sure . While you were unconscious in the hospital this afternoon , my doctors worked on you . Why ? At some point I realized that ... if the Syndicate didn 't kill you , the FBI would . If the FBI didn 't kill you , your own misguided heroism would . There 's really no way out for you . There 's no way for you to cheat death except by disappearing . - A man can 't just disappear . - Well , we 've made entire cultures disappear . Like me , now you 'll ... you 'll become a man without a name . But even while you miss your former identity , you 'll learn to love life 's simpler pleasures . That 'll be kinda tough with these on . When you no longer want to run , those 'll come off . How do you feel ? I feel better than I did . I gotta tell Scully . I gotta tell her . If you do have contact with her , you 'll put her in danger . You 're entering a kind of witness-protection programme , for want of a better term . Can I offer you a cigarette ? I don 't smoke . Maybe now you do . Don 't move ! Who 's there ? I don 't mean to frighten you . Albert Hosteen . What are you doing here ? - How did you get here ? - I 'm sorry to surprise you . Surprise ? That you 're standing here ... Last time I saw you was in New Mexico . They 'd taken you from the hospital . - Your doctors feared the worst . - I was hoping to see your partner . He 's missing . You must save him . - He 's very ill . - Find him before something happens . Not only for his sake - for the sake of us all . - Where are we ? - Home . This is your new life . I don 't understand ... You can drive away right now . Drive back to Scully and your X-Files and imminent death . I wouldn 't be surprised if you did . But I think you should take a look around . I mean , why leave something behind until you know what it is you 're leaving ? Mulder was taken just before 2 a.m. His mother 's signature 's on the documents . It 's her handwriting . She checked him out AMA - against medical advice . It 's all legitimate until you go to surveillance . This is the camera outside Mulder 's room . Here 's inside his room . And two other cameras on the ward . We 're guesstimating there were at least three others involved . Check this out . Where 's Waldo ? - She 's talkin ' to someone . - Yeah . I know who that is . Hello ? Anybody home ? They can change your name ... but they can 't change the things you love . It can 't be . - You 're dead . - No . No , just really relaxed . Scully ... saw you get shot ... on the bridge six years ago . I was sure you were ... dead . One , uh , well-placed bullet ... A punctuation mark in a man 's life and you get to start a whole new chapter . I 'm fine , son . Aside from a little tennis elbow . I felt responsible for your death . You can let that go . Clearly I 'm alive . I thought you died for my quest . Yes , along with Scully 's sister and the man you thought was your father , and Duane Barry and even Scully 's mysterious illness , and on and on and on . You can let go of all that guilt . I 'm here to tell you that you 're not the hub of the universe , the cause of life and death . We - you and I - are merely puppets in a master plan . No more , no less . You 've suffered enough . Now you should enjoy your life . Let me show you somethin ' . That 's my wife and daughters . We live just down the street . I hope ... you visit us for dinner . Oh . Oh , hey , buddy , that 's OK . You can build it again . Just start again . OK ? Who 's there ? - Who are you ? - Hundreds of little joys . To open a door and have a woman beckon you in . To have her make a fire and lay the table for you . And when it 's late , to feel her take you into her arms . This is Tina Mulder . I 'm not in to take your call . Please leave your message . This is Dana Scully . Thank you . As before , you can reach me at your son 's office at the FBI . Thank you . - Skinner . - Sir , did you send me this book ? - Excuse me ? - This book . It explains everything that I found in Africa , using the same symbols I found on the ship . I asked you not to involve me in this . It 's all here , sir . A foretelling of mass extinction , a myth about a man who can save us from it . That 's why they took Mulder . They think that his illness is a gift - protection against the coming plague . The assistant director has given me express orders not to let you in . Sir , are you hurt ? Are you cut ? Get on the phone . Hey ! Stop that man ! Morning . - What 's wrong , Fox ? - There 's nothing wrong . Perfect . - It 's perfect . What the hell am I doing here ? - You just need some coffee . No , I 'm serious . I have commitments - to the X-Files , to Scully , to my sister ... You think you know what that means ? Commitment ? It 's all just childish , Fox . - Childish ? - Yes . You 've been a child . With only the responsibility of a child - to your own dreams and fantasies . You won 't know the true joy of responsibility until you plant your feet in the world ... and become a father . Wow . Diana , you lay all this on me after I sleep with you once , what 's it gonna to be like tomorrow ? - You have to let go , Fox . - I 'm just supposed to slip into domestic bliss even after I was brought here by a man I believe left here to carry on his dirty work ? He lives the next block over . We 'll go visit after breakfast . You told someone , didn 't you ? You let the information out . - What are you talking about ? - A man attacked Skinner in his office . - For what ? - For what he knows about Mulder . I haven 't told anyone . What is this ? These are mine ! You 've hacked into my files . What are you doing with these ? - I was having them analyzed . - By whom ? - The National Institutes of Health . - What ? That material - encrypted data that describes advanced human genetics - where did you get it ? This was not supposed to go public . Wherever you got it , that data supports what 's happened to Mulder . It proves what he 's become - biologically alien . What are you hiding ? - It doesn 't matter . - It matters to someone . Whoever it is , it sounds like they 're looking for Mulder too . I wasn 't expecting you so soon . I thought you 'd take a few days to settle in . I think you need to allay his unhappiness with things he perceives as left undone . Yeah , including why you live in a bigger house than I do . I 've got quite a few mouths to feed - three grandkids . And , uh ... your sister . She 's been living here all along . Living a life you 'd forsaken . He said you were coming . A father has high hopes for his son , but he never dreams he 's gonna change the world . I 'm so proud of this man - the depth of his capacity for suffering . Like father , like son . They think what he has is killing him , but , in actuality , he 's never been more alive . - Do you think he dreams ? - Oh , I 'm sure he dreams . About what , I wonder . The dreams all men who are owned by the world have . A simpler life full of small pleasures . Extraordinary men are always most tempted by the most ordinary things . Dreams are all he has now . - Bum a cigarette , Agent Fowley ? - I don 't smoke . Really ? I could swear I smell cigarette smoke on you . - Let 's cut the crap , shall we ? - Yes . Let 's , - Where 's Mulder ? - Before you blame everyone you can find for what 's happened to Mulder , think about what you could 've done to prevent it . I just want you to think . Think of Mulder when you met him . Think of the promise and the life in front of him . Think of him now . And then try and stand there in front of me , look me in the eye and tell me Mulder wouldn 't bust his ass trying to save you . I 'm thinking , Agent Scully . I 'm always thinking . It 's a chance none of us ever expected , let alone hoped for . After all these years trying to develop a compatible alien-human hybrid , to have one ready-made ... All these years ... all the questioning why ... why keep Mulder alive , when it was so simple to remove the threat that he posed ? - You couldn 't have predicted this . - The fact remains , he 's become our saviour . He 's immune to the coming viral apocalypse . He 's the hero here . He may not survive the procedure . Then he suffers a hero 's fate . Diana ? Fox ? It 's time , honey . Hey , how you doin ' ? Don 't think of the man . Think of the sacrifice he 's making for all of us . For the world . It would 've been nice to give him a choice . You don 't think Mulder would 've chosen this ? To become the thing he sought for so long ? To feel what it 's like ? He is what he sought . - We 'll never know . - Besides , his task is almost complete . I 'll carry the burden from hereon in . I know about the boy . The boy on the beach . The vision you go to in your mind . We all have such places ... born of memory and desire . I 've seen him thousands of times . But I 've never seen what he wants me to see . Close your eyes . He 's ready to show you if you 're ready to see . Wow . What did you make ? An unidentified flying object . Hey , what are you doin ' ? Why are you destroying your spaceship ? It 's your spaceship . You 're destroying it . You were supposed to help me . You 're running out of time . Why do you come to me like this ? Why ? - When I can 't find him . - You don 't look in the right place . - You 're not hearing me . - You don 't know where he is ? Even if I did , I wouldn 't know how to save him , This science makes no sense to me . Have you looked for him here ? Are you asking me to pray ? There are more worlds than the one you can hold in your hand . I hope you see the poetry in this , Diana . You 're removing material that may kill your son . We 're forcing the next step in evolution to save man . We 're doing God 's work , Diana . Without this immunity , everyone would die . This knowledge is God 's blessing . I 'll carry on for Mulder from here . The patient 's come out . Mulder 's awake . - He won 't stay under . - I don 't think we can take him any further . - Is he feeling any pain ? - Flat on the monitor , - Any flatter , he 'd be circling the drain . - OK . Let 's do this thing . Rest now . Can you open the blind ? I 'd like to take a look outside . I wanted you to have peace . Where 's Samantha ? Your sister died five years ago . Where ... What about Deep Throat ? We 've been over this . He 's dead . Diana 's dead . And Scully . Scully 's dead ? She 's dead . It 's time for you to let go . They 're waiting for you ... if you let go . Close your eyes , Fox . We 're the last , you and I. The end . And the beginning . There 's nothing to be done . Nothing at all . Scully . I knew you 'd come . They told me you were dead . And you believed them . - Traitor . - What ? Deserter . Coward . Scully , don 't . I 'm dying . You 're not supposed to die , Mulder . Not here . - What do you mean ? - Not in a bed with the devil outside . No , you don 't understand . He 's taken care of me . No , Mulder , he 's lulled you to sleep . He 's made you trade your true mission for creature comforts . There was no mission . - There were no aliens . - No aliens , Have you looked outside . Mulder ? I can 't . I 'm ... too tired . No , Mulder , you must get up . You must get up and fight . Especially you . This isn 't your place . Get up , Mulder . Get up and fight the fight . Scully ... Where 's Scully ? Scully . Scully ! Mulder . Mulder , you 've got to wake up . I 've got to get you out of here . Mulder , can you understand me ? Mulder , you 've got to get up . I don 't know how much time we have . You 've got to get up , Mulder . No one can do it but you , Mulder . Mulder , help me . Please , Mulder . You ... help ... me . Scully , what are you doin ' here ? I was just gettin ' dressed to come see you , but I ... I couldn 't find a tie to go with my victory cap . - No work . You have to go back to bed . - Oh , wait . Tie goes to the runner . Scully , I , um ... I was comin ' down to work to tell you that Albert Hosteen is dead . He died last night in New Mexico . He 'd been in a coma for two weeks . He couldn 't have been in your apartment . He was there . We prayed together . Mulder , I don 't believe that . I don 't believe it . It 's impossible . Is it any more impossible than what you saw in Africa , or what you saw in me ? I don 't know what to believe any more . Mulder , I was so determined to find a cure to save you that I could deny what it was that I saw . And now I don 't even know ... I don 't know what the truth is , I don 't know who to listen to , I don 't know who to trust . Diana Fowley was found murdered this morning . I never trusted her ... but she helped save your life just as much as I did . She gave me that book . It was her key that led me to you . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I know she was your friend . Scully , I was like you once . I didn 't know who to trust . Then I ... I chose another path ... another life , another fate , where I found my sister . And even though my world was unrecognizable and upside down ... there was one thing that remained the same . You ... were my friend , and you told me the truth . Even when the world was falling apart , you were my constant , my touchstone . And you are mine . Ah ! I made this !

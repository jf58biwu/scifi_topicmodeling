 [ Man Trilling , Chirping ] [ Trills , Chirps , Laughs ] What am I doing here ? Hercules always warned me my quest for the almighty dinar would be the death of me . Did I listen ? No-o-o ! Here I am in bandit country . They stole my food . No quail to catch . [ Buzzes , Trills ] [ Grunting Angrily ] All because of a wild rumor about a lost gold mine in the Baklava Province . Salmoneus , you deserve to starve . Just kidding . Maybe they have some food . Some food . Some mead . It 's all I need . [ Salmoneus ] Hello ? Anybody here ? Oh , swell . No people . No food . [ Rodents Screeching ] [ Loud Thud ] Who 's there ? I 'm not alone . Hercules , where are ya ? [ Gruff Voice ] I 'm over here . Good . Stay close . Show yourself . We 're not afraid . [ Gruff Voice ] No ! I 'm never afraid ! [ Chuckling Nervously ] Gold ! Ohh . Who needs food ? I 've died and gone to Mount Olympus . Oh . There 's more where this came from ! [ Screams ] [ Scream Echoes ] [ Woman ] How many were there ? [ Iolaus ] Three other girls are missing from the village . [ Woman ] You said your cousin didn 't have the happiest home . Moria , my cousin Regina did not run away . Then my guess is they were abducted ... by visitors . Oh . From other continents . - You can 't believe we 're the only civilization ? - Okay . What would these visitors want with my cousin ? You think I 'm crazy ? No . No . You 're ... a few sandwiches short of a picnic maybe , but not crazy . Why do you think theStar-Globussent me on this story ? Would I hurt your feelings if I told you I couldn 't care less ? Because they 're out there . Ohh . And I 'm newshound enough to sniff them out . [ Groans ] All I wanna do is find my cousin . Moria , I asked you along here because I thought you could help , but ever since we 've started , all you 've done is talk about people from beyond the stars ... and strange creatures from other continents , " abdominal snowmen . " That 's " abominable . " No . No . What is abominable is that ... we are in the middle of bandit country , and I 'm stuck with you ! And if you 're not talking about celestial visitors , then you 're complaining about the food ... or asking interminable questions ! I 'm a reporter ! How am I supposed to learn if I don 't ask ? See ? See ? Why don 't you try taking a few quiet moments and writing something down ? I don 't have to . I have a pictographic memory . " Pictographic memory . " When are we gonna eat ? [ Mock Crying ] I don 't know ! [ Huffs ] Look . There 's an abandoned temple . Let 's see if we can find shelter there for the night . - You think they 'll have any food ? - I don 't know ! Iolaus , wait up . [ Rodents Squealing ] - [ Running Footsteps ] - Your gold or your life ! My gold or my life ? [ All Grunting ] [ Moria Kiaiing ] [ Man Yells ] [ Moria ] Take that ! - [ Man Gasping ] - [ Man # 2 ] Come on . Let 's get out of here ! Get out of here . Go on . Go on . Get out . Why were they trying to abduct us ? How would I know ? Maybe they heard the same gold rumors we did . Why would they think we had any gold ? Will you stop asking questions ! Oh , and by the way , thanks for , you know , helping ' me . It was- - Where 'd you get this flour ? I landed on it . Why ? Well , if there 's any more where this came from , we can have our dinner . Wow . [ Gasps ] Are you as hungry as I am ? Are the gods crazy ? Mmm . Good . Mmm . Iolaus . [ Gasps ] We 've had visitors . Would you quit with these cosmic fantasies ? I 'm not fantasizing . Huh ? [ Moria ] The food 's gone . And look what they 've left us in exchange . [ Screams ] Oh ! [ Rodents Squealing ] Iolaus ? [ Screams ] Thanks for breaking my fall . You 're welcome . What is this place ? There you go with those questions again . [ Yelps ] I have another one for you . dddd [ Sitar ] dddd [ Woman Vocalizing ] Where are we ? [ Chattering ] [ Man Narrating ] This is the story of a time long ago , a time of myth and legend , when the ancient gods were petty and cruel , and they plagued mankind with suffering . Only one man dared to challenge their power- - Hercules . Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen , a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart . He journeyed the earth , battling the minions of his wicked stepmother , Hera , the all-powerful queen of the gods . But wherever there was evil , wherever an innocent would suffer , there would be ... Hercules . - [ Screeching ] - [ Roaring ] Hail ! dddd [ Continues ] [ Chattering Continues ] Looks like a welcoming committee . Peace and love , brother . [ Chirps ] - Salmoneus ? - Brother Sal , have we met ? Iolaus ? Friend of Hercules ? - [ Woman ] Welcome . - No . Doesn 't ring a bell . But we 're all friends here . Peace and love , sister . [ Chirps ] Uh , my name 's Moria , and we are not related . [ Chuckles ] Welcome , friend . Yeah . Yeah . Good . Salmoneus . - What are you people doing here ? - This is Sister Aurora . Peace ... and love . - [ Salmoneus Chirps ] - No . I meant who are you and what are you doing here ? Why don 't we give you a little tour of our community , and you can see for yourself ? [ Sighs ] Lead the way . You see , we have an underground spring that supplies all of our water needs . What about food ? You 'd be surprised how little food you need ... once you put your spiritual side ahead of your temporal . But you do eat ? Of course . One cannot chew on spirituality . [ Chirps ] You might say we live by the Golden Rule . We mine the gold and trade with the outside world for food . Gold ? That 's where it came from . But nobody wants to leave or see the outside world again ? - Yeah . Grab that gold and run ? - Why would anyone want to leave ? We have everything we need right here . There 's no violence . We all work and share equally . There 's no need to be competitive , for there 's nothing more to gain than what you already have . [ Chirps ] But nobody ever wants more ? More ? That 's a negative concept . [ Chuckles ] You sure you 're all right ? Never felt better , friend . The teachings of Lorel frees me- - Lorel ? Our god . Kamaros interprets for us . - I 'd really like to see this Kamaros . - You will . We 're all going to have dinner . [ Man ] Food is taken very seriously in our community . I do extensive studies in the areas of nutrition and diet , so I hope you 're enjoying your meal . What there is of it . Among my findings , I 've learned that we don 't need as much food as we think ... to sustain strength and energy . But perhaps dessert will fill you up . What a lifestyle you have here . I 'd be the first to be embarrassed at the luxuriousness of my surroundings . I 'm perfectly content to serve Lorel in a more spartan capacity . Yet , if our god wishes , who am I to question it ? Yeah . By communizing our efforts , we can produce more fruitful , harmonious results ... than a traditional hierarchy-based society . So that means you work down in the mines like everyone else ? [ Salmoneus ] Anyone can work down in the mines . Only a select few can interpret the wishes of our powerful , yet benevolent god . - [ Slurps ] - Well put , Brother Sal , but you make it sound so important . I am but a humble servant doing our god 's bidding . Now , why don 't we enjoy our dessert ? You know , we hate to eat and run , but we 're gonna eat and run . You 're allergic to that , remember ? Besides , I 'd really like to see the rest of this place . - You mind if we take our own tour ? - Not at all . Treat our home as if it were your own . - If Brother Sal or I can be of any assistance- - - [ Muffled Grunting ] Yeah . Thanks . We 'll , um- - We 'll let you know . Iolaus , stop . Why did we leave ? There was something wrong with that dessert . Oh . They tried to poison us ! Hello ! Everyone else ate it . So ? That could be what makes these people so touchy-feely . I mean , they hug all the time . There 's gotta be- - Moria , what- - Well , come to think of it , that is not the Salmoneus I used to know . It 's like- - It 's like they 've done something to his mind . Yeah . I 've noticed . If you look in his eyes , he 's just not all there . dddd [ Instrumental ] [ Chattering ] Mmm . Good morning . Peace and love , sister . You too . I love you , man . Yeah , uh- - Yeah , I love you too . [ Kisses ] Regina ? Regina . Is it you ? Yes . Do I know you ? It 's me . It 's your cousin , Iolaus . I 'm sorry . I- - I don 't recognize you . That 's crazy . I- - I taught you how to shoot a bow and arrow , remember ? It 's all fun and games till somebody loses an eye . I have to go . No , Regina . Wait . Friend , there are plenty of available women ... if this one isn 't interested in you . I 'm not your friend , and I 'm not interested in her- - not like that . - She 's his cousin . - We 're all family here . Yeah ? Well , I don 't want a family . Iolaus ! I just wanna know why Regina doesn 't recognize me . Sometimes our inner selves are not in harmony with the outside world . [ Scoffs ] You guys really believe that stuff , don 't you ? It is the way of Lorel , our godhead . Yeah ? Well , I 'll believe this god when I see him . She 's appearing now . [ In Unison ] She ? dddd [ Mystical ] [ Onlookers Gasping ] [ Murmuring ] [ Iolaus ] There goes your powerful but benevolent god . She 's barely out of diapers . Yeah . They don 't seem to mind . Suppose this place is a paradise . - [ Man ] Hail to Lorel . - [ Woman Speaking , Indistinct ] Oh , no . Here comes Salmoneus . Oh , I can 't uncover any conspiracies with him around . Yeah . Tell him you want a personal tour , and I can do some snooping of my own . Guess again . Brother Sal . [ Sighs Cheerfully ] - [ Continues Sighing ] - What a coincidence . Iolaus was just saying how he 'd love a tour of your gold-mining facilities . Hey ! I 'd love to give both of you a tour . I 'll take a rain check . I have some questions for your god . No . I 'm sorry . You can 't just wander around aimlessly . Oh , don 't worry . I 'll go through the proper channels . You know what ? I don 't need a personal guide , Salmoneus . Brother Sal- - and it 's my pleasure- - we don 't get many visitors here . I 'm always happy to show them how we live , what we 're about . [ Hums ] - Is the fruit to your liking , master ? - Very much so . And the wine ? Excellent . Now , watch , Aurora . Learn how best to serve an emissary of God . Oh , no . Dear Aurora , you must observe . How else will you learn ? - [ Kisses , Chuckles ] - [ Girl Moans ] You 're going to be thrilled and delighted . Here is the entrance to our mine . [ Workers Chattering ] And this gold doesn 't interest you , right ? It 's only so much rock and mineral . [ Laughs ] Boy . You 've really changed from the Salmoneus I used to know . I 'm sorry . I don 't follow . Whatever happened to that ambitious , dinar-loving little ... opportunist ... who always bugged Hercules ? [ Chirps ] You must have me confused with somebody else . [ Birds Chirping ] [ Whimpering ] Are you all right ? It 's nothing . You 're upset about something . It 's Lorel . Your child god ? What about her ? She- - She 's my sister . [ Iolaus ] So much dust and glitter , right ? Exactly . And no one really cares about it , huh ? Why should they ? There are no possessions here , so there 's no reason to be envious . We all share in everything equally . Yahoo ! Yah ! [ Snaps Fingers ] So this means you could all share Kamaros 's things . Absolutely , if one wished . It 's all community property . What 's yours is mine . What 's mine- - What 's mine is mine alone . Yeah , I 'm familiar with that . You 're very cynical . That will change with time . [ Woman ] Catch ! Ohh . You share the women as well ? Huh ? If we don 't believe in owning things , why should we believe in possessing people ? We share everything . Everything ? You know , I would really like to see my cousin again . I could do that . She works not far from here ... in food storage . [ Moria ] How did you and your sister ever get mixed up in this ? It 's all my fault . We 're from a village in the next valley . So you were one of those that exchanged food for gold ? I met Kamaros , and he was so ... charismatic . I really wanted to believe him . He told me the whole community was free of violence , and it was all about peace and love . I 've just realized that all he cares about is the love part , if you can call it that . And Lorel ? He 's done something to her . She used to be nothing but energy and talk , and now she walks around in this fog . I 've heard they do that . Who ? Visitors . What ? Oh . Never mind . She 's not a god . She 's my kid sister . Look . Don 't worry . We 'll help her . Very impressive . See how happy your cousin is ? And the harmony of the workers , each performing his own little task , sharing the fruits of their labor , following the way of Lorel . Yeah . I 'd still like to know why Regina didn 't recognize me . Sometimes we need help to get in touch with our true inner being . That 's what the reeducation room is for . [ Electronic Whirring ] Reeducation ? A special place . I 'll show you . You know what , Sal ? Brother Sal . Yeah . Good . Maybe some other time . I 've got a lot of looking around to do . Fine . You 're our guest . Yeah . What is it ? We have to rescue Lorel . - That would be Lorel , the child god ? - She 's not a god . She 's Aurora 's sister . She 's your sister ? Kamaros has ... done something to her . Yeah . I think I know what it is . I 've just been to food storage , and I noticed the same odor I smelled on the dessert . What kind of odor ? It 's lotus leaf . It 's an opiate that Hercules 's cousin , Asclepius , told us about . It 's not lethal , but we 've gotta get your sister off it . The sooner , the better . You have a plan ? Yeah . Kind of . I made a deal with Salmoneus that if he didn 't eat food for a day , I 'd join the band . What ? It 's a long shot . Here . If there 's any trouble , try giving him these gold nuggets . [ Moria ] I don 't understand . Well , if he doesn 't eat the food- - It 's a long shot . Don 't be afraid . Aurora sent me . Can you understand me ? You eat this ? [ Sniffs ] Tastes good , huh ? Look , I haven 't got time to explain , but I have to get you out of here . And it 's gonna be easier if I just carry you , okay ? Come on . Good . I take this to mean you don 't approve of our little community ? Oh , I 've seen it before , only then it wasn 't called " interpreter " and " disciples . " - It was called " master " and " slaves . " - I 'm sorry you feel that way . [ All Grunting ] Good , but not good enough . You 'd better be careful with that thing . You don 't wanna lose your god . There are plenty more where she came from . [ Whooshing ] [ Yelps ] [ Grunting , Groaning ] [ Grunts ] Have a nice day . In case you haven 't guessed , the poison from that dart isn 't fatal . It will merely aid in your ... reeducation . Thanks . I 've already finished my schooling . I 'm afraid you 've got a lot more to learn . You 're too aggressive for our little community . - [ Gasping ] - Reprogramming or reeducation , as we like to call it , is definitely called for . What if I don 't want to be reeducated ? - What if I don 't want to join your plan to rule the world ? - You misjudge me . Why would I want the world ? I have everything I could want right here . Trick is not to let anyone come in and spoil it . Like me . Like you . As for your lack of enthusiasm , you really don 't have any choice . In my travels , I 've learned many things . A mastery over lights . The necessity of sleep . Hercules 's own cousin ... taught me about the healing and intoxicating qualities of certain herbs and plants . You 'll be one of us ... eventually . Don 't count on it . Oh , I 'll count on it . Peace , brother . I 'm not your brother . Hey , you will be , whether you want to or not . Begin . [ Blades Whooshing ] [ Exhaling Forcefully ] dddd [ Instrumental ] [ Chattering ] You have to help us . Iolaus is in trouble . He doesn 't keep his word . He promised if I gave up food for a day , he 'd join the band . I did . He 's not here . And I 'm hun-gry . Wha- - What do you think you 're doing ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . You 're trying to tempt me , aren 't you ? What gives you that idea ? Oh , yeah . Ha , ha , ha . See , I am impervious to the overtures of the out- - Could I have another sniff of that ? Just a- - huh . Keep it . The teachings of Lorel tell us that the outside world is not- - Do you have any more in there ? [ Sighs ] [ Gasps ] You 're bad . Bad girls . Bad girls . I 'm gonna tell Kamaros how naughty you 've been , and you 're gonna get in trouble . [ Sniffs ] [ Whooshing Continues ] [ Buzzing ] Sorry . You 're not allowed to sleep . - You guys aren 't big on creature comforts , are you ? - The purpose of the room ... is not to soothe the body , but to ease the mind . I guess that fan 's not for cooling me off then , huh ? It 's for filtering light . When it revolves at the right rate , it can induce a trancelike state , leaving the mind extremely malleable . Sounds like a lot of laughs . Kamaros is a master of light manipulation . It 's extraordinary the things he 's accomplished for the good of the community . Yeah . I 'll bet . dddd [ Instrumental ] [ Chattering ] Aren 't you Iolaus 's cousin ? Iolaus ? He talked to me , wanted me to stop eating for a while . And ? I can 't remember . It 's so confusing . Try harder . Maybe we shouldn 't force it . We have to . Memories are important . They 're who we are . Regina , remember when you and Iolaus tied your father 's sandals together , and he fell in the pig trough ? - Kind of . Were you there ? - He told me the story . He was right about the food . You 're starting to remember . - Come with us . - Where are you going ? To rescue Lorel from Kamaros . Rescue ? - From Kamaros ? - Lorel 's my sister . She 's not a god . Kamaros has just tricked everyone into believing that . Iolaus tried to get her from the palace , but , well , something 's happened . - We think he 's been taken to the reeducation room . - We 'd better go . [ Speaking , Indistinct , Voice Echoing ] - You 're not enjoying yourself . - [ Gasping ] From your babbling , I 'd say you have an uncommon fear of death . [ Gasps ] The only thing that I 'm scared of ... is ... turning into a creep like you . Oh , such spirit . Enjoy it while you can . Because in a few more hours , you won 't even remember who you are . [ Voice Echoing ] Who you are . [ Gears Grinding , Groaning , Blades Whooshing ] [ Distorted Yells , Gasps ] [ Screaming ] [ Laughter , Chattering ] Stay here . If anything goes wrong , at least you two won 't be caught . But I wanna see Iolaus again . Yeah . We 're all in this together . It 's just not a good idea . [ Man ] Keep an eye out for the stranger . Now will you stay here ? [ Buzzing ] What 's the matter ? He 's gone . Is there any other place they could have taken him ? Then they 've killed him . Maybe he escaped . Where to ? There 's nowhere to go down here . He could 've gone back to get your sister . Moria . Iolaus . Greetings , friends . - What 's with the outfit ? - Peace and love , sister . Oh , no . Likewise . Iolaus , it 's me , Moria . Oh , I 'm so pleased to meet you , Moria . - Has anyone shown you our fair city yet ? - What have you done to him ? - Maybe he 's found a better life . - I 'll be the judge of that . Moria , why are you angry ? Anger is a negative emotion . If you 're so sure he 's gone over to your side , can I speak with him alone ? I see no reason why not . Ha . Okay . You can drop the act now . I 'm not sure I understand . Iolaus , it 's me , Moria . [ Gasps ] We came here together looking for visitors . [ Gasps ] Togetherness is next to godliness . [ Gasps Happily , Hums ] They really did it to you , didn 't they ? They changed you . Change is often necessary ... if we are to remain in touch with our true selves . It 's like sitting in a cave . What we see before us are but shadows , [ Over Device ] and what is behind us is the truth . I have to be getting back . I hope to see you later , friend . Peace and love . Yeah . Sure . [ Clicks Teeth ] Are you sure we can save my sister without Iolaus 's help ? We don 't have any choice . [ Salmoneus ] Girls ! Hello . What do you want from us ? I wanna thank you for waking me up . I can 't believe what a " schmendrick " I was . - Brother Sal is starting to remember the old Salmoneus ? - You bet . I even remember Iolaus . He used to hang around with some big guy- - uh- - [ Snapping Fingers ] Name escapes me . Salmoneus , Iolaus is in trouble . They 've done something to his mind . - And we need his help to rescue Lorel . - Rescue a god ? Are you crazy ? I 'll tell you what to rescue . Across the square , there 's a roomful of gold . That 's what needs rescuing . Iolaus is your friend . You 're right . Who ? Oh , the blond guy . Yeah . Let me get some gold first . [ Sighs ] Looks like we 're on our own . No . I 'm on my own . There 's no sense risking all our lives . - Lose something ? - Oh , just a friend , and now a god . - It 's been one of those days . I can come back later . - I 'd rather you stay . [ Panting ] Watch out . That goes off , it 'll ruin your reputation as a man of peace . And put an untidy hole in your blouse . [ Laughs Ironically ] Good point . I 'll just be going . - [ Weapon Cocks ] - Anywhere you want me to . dddd [ Ceremonial ] dddd [ Woman Vocalizing ] [ Groans ] She refuses to eat it . [ Gasps ] Sister , how are you ever going to find your true self ... if you don 't take the nourishment we provide ? You know what you two can do with your nourishment . [ Spits ] I 'm glad you haven 't changed , Moria . [ Gagging ] I learned one or two things on my travels too : Meditation is also a way to control your mind , and now that I know the other women are safe , it doesn 't matter . Neither of you are leaving here alive . [ Grunts ] [ Kiaiing ] [ Cackles ] - I can 't believe I did that . - [ Groans ] [ Gasping ] - [ Laughs Malevolently ] - Iolaus , catch ! [ Grunts ] What am I supposed to do with it ? [ Screams , Grunts ] - Never mind . - [ Grunts ] Oh , great . Now I know where I 've seen this emblem , Kamaros . Or should I say Karkus ? You know , if you 're gonna reinvent yourself , you really oughta change the markings on your swords . Karkus ? Butcher of Thessaly ? The one and the same . Guess you found manipulating people 's minds a little easier than butchering them , huh ? Much easier . And you don 't even have to get your hands dirty . [ Both Grunting ] Your hands are dirty . You 've turned those people into slaves . People are sheep , you know- - born followers . I merely stepped in and filled the void . Prepare to step back out . Salmoneus , take Moria and help the others spread the news about their leader . - I 'm going as fast as I can . - We 've got to finish this conversation . - Nice cut . - Yeah . Come on ! - [ Blades Whooshing ] - You 've made a big mistake . - The Butcher is back . - [ Scoffs ] Oh , brother . [ Cackles ] [ Onlookers Humming ] Where 's Iolaus ? He 'll be right along . Right now we have to show these people the real light . You people have been duped by Kamaros . Lorel isn 't a god . - She 's flesh and blood , like everyone else . - You blasphemer ! - [ Man ] That 's right . - [ Man # 2 ] Sacrilege ! - Maybe this isn 't such a good idea . - [ Man ] Lorel is our god . No . You 've been tricked , all of you . Kamaros is nothing more than a fast-talking magician . You 're wasting your time . My disciples won 't do anything unless I tell them . Maybe they 'll be a little more open-minded . That lotus leaf you 've been spiking their food with wears off when you stop eating it . It 's a pity you won 't live to see the fruits of your meddling . Lorel is my sister . Kamaros drugged her . He made her do what he wanted so that you would do his wishes , not hers . - You 're a liar . - [ Confused Murmuring ] - My sister doesn 't lie . - [ Crowd Gasping ] Kamaros is the one who 's lied to you . He doesn 't care about your good- - only his own . - Why do you think he lives better than everyone else ? - [ Woman ] Who do we believe ? Let 's make this interesting , shall we ? The system of pulleys and counterweights are rigged to the beams over the city . When they buckle , this whole place 'll collapse in on itself . - You 're sick . - Maybe . But I 'm the only one who knows a way out . [ Both Grunting ] Friends , listen to her . You 've been brainwashed . I was brainwashed ... to serve Kamaros 's own purposes . [ Rumbling Overhead ] - [ Man ] What 's that ? - [ Woman ] What 's happening ? - [ Anxious Murmuring ] - [ Woman ] The roof 's falling in ! - Oh , no . [ Groans , Grunts ] Sorry . You can 't come with us . [ Kamaros Screaming ] [ Sword , Blades Clanking ] I 'm not . [ Rumbling Overhead ] [ All Screaming ] Come on ! Over here ! This way ! Kamaros has rigged it so the whole place is gonna cave in . Come on ! I 'll just be a moment . Salmoneus , what is more important ? The gold or your life ? Salmoneus ? I 'm thinking ! Let 's go . Come on ! [ All Screaming ] [ Gasping ] [ Woman Screams ] Come on . Come on . That 's it . Come on . Thanks , Iolaus . She 's looking better already . Go ! Go ! Come on ! Iolaus ! Regina , I haven 't got time for this . She remembers you ! Yeah . She 'll remember more when the drugs wear off . [ Explosion ] Pity . They had some great ideas . Yeah . All that free love . [ Both Moaning ] [ Man ] Oh , fresh air ! Look ! The sky ! [ Man ] I can see the sun ! [ Iolaus Laughs ] It 's a souvenir . There 's nothing wrong with a souvenir ... or two . Sal ! Girls , don 't forget Salmoneus ! Well , looks like you got your story . I 'm just sorry there were no visitors in it . Oh , that 's all right . But , you know , I do high-profile stuff too , and I was thinking maybe you could set something up for me with your buddy Hercules . I don 't think Hercules wants to see his name in theStar-Globus . " Hero Gives Birth to Two-headed Dog " is not really his kind of thing . I wouldn 't do a hatchet job on him . I was talking about a classy , high-profile piece . Oh ! " Maps to Heroes ' Homes , " something like that . Well , I don 't know . I 'll have to think about it . How ' bout over dinner ?

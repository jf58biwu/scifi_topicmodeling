 Dr. Solomon , the Dean 's office called . They say you never had your physical . How can they say that ? So you did take your physical ? I did nothing of the sort . Everyone who works here has to take one . Oh . I 've scheduled you with Dr. Howard for this afternoon . Oh , well , Dr. Howard is in for a treat . I am a masterpiece , a perfect human being . Not a strand of Dna out of place . He 'll probably want my organs to put on display . Yeah , the sooner the better . Oh , yeah . Oh , nice place . It 's , uh ... a bit sterile . And you could use a touch of potpourri to mask this somewhat disturbing smell . But it 's nice and bright , in a glaring , fluorescent sort of way . Have a seat . Crunchy . Now you can go ahead and disrobe . Righto . I 'll just be naked here ... in this cold room ... with these strange machines ... gleaming instruments ... whose function I can only imagine . Aah ! Now , now . Nothing to worry about . Aah ! Aah ! Will somebody make that music stop ! Dick , I 'll be with you in a minute . The hell you will ! Halloween is such a rip ! There 's no big meal , you don 't get the day off , and on top of that , it 's meaningless . Actually , Sally , uh , Halloween is revered as the day when the graves yawn and the dead rise . Plus you get to stick candy corns up your nose . The most ridiculous thing happened today . Whoa ! Get ready for the zinger . I had to take a physical . Ah ha ha ! That 's not the least bit funny . But when I got to the doctor 's , for some reason I got scared , and I had to leave . Well , what do you have to be scared of ? These bodies , they 're human . They can 't tell you 're an alien . Yeah , I mean , besides , you 've already been to the doctor for your foot . But that was to fix something . Now he 's just going in looking for trouble . So , Dick , did you go to the doctor ? If you 're asking me if I went to the doctor , yes , I went to the doctor . What 'd he say ? Oh , the usual . " Hi . How are you ? " " Where are you going ? Come back ! " You 're just being silly . You 're just like my cousin Paul . He avoided going to the doctor , kept putting it off and putting it off until one day he just dropped dead . So he never had to go to the doctor ? Oh , hey , Dick , you forgot your lunch . Oh , thank you , Sally . Where is it ? I forgot it . Sally , I 'm glad you 're here . I have to go to a Halloween party tonight . I was wondering if you could house-sit for me . I 'd hate for no one to be there to give those cute little kids candy . Why ? Because , otherwise , the little brats egg your house and cover your trees with toilet paper . Sure , Albright . A beautiful woman like me has no plans on Halloween . I 'm so sorry . What was I thinking ? No , I mean it . I actually have nothing to do . Oh , thank you so much . Dr. Solomon , if you don 't get your physical , they 're gonna hold your paychecks until you do . Oh , oh , Nina . Of course , I 'll go . I 'm looking forward to it . That 's better . Come with me , Nina . Please ! I can 't face the doctor alone . What are you afraid of ? Oh , I don 't know . Ever since I went there , I 'm scared of everything . Come with me , please ! Me ? Why don 't you ask Dr. Albright ? Mary ? Seeing me naked and vulnerable , quivering with fear ? Oh , ho , I wouldn 't give her the satisfaction . Well , why do I have to get the satisfaction ? Nina , could you tie my gown ? Did you turn it around yet ? Yes . Dick , good to have you back . How are you doing ? Fine , doctor . I feel fine . My pulse is normal , blood pressure 's fine . Looks like I 'm good to go . Thank you , doctor . If you don 't mind , Dick , I 'd like to take a look myself . Now why don 't you just ... open your mouth . Mm-mmm . Come on now , honey . Open up for the nice doctor . Dick , I can 't help you if you don 't cooperate . I don 't know what you mean . I 'm here . I 'm disrobed . I 've done everything you could reasonably expect . Now it 's time for me to go . Good-bye . Dick , your clothes ! Oh , keep ' em ! No poison in that one . More raisins than I care for , but there 's no crime in that . Who 's that supposed to be ? Julius and Ethel Rosenberg . I think the guy at the store made a mistake . All right , come on , guys , lock and load . We 're going to Albright 's . Why ? What for ? It 's Halloween , Harry . And every little brat in Rutherford is hopped up higher than a kite on m and m 's . And from what I hear , Albright 's house is ground zero for destruction . Oh , no , that sounds too dangerous . You can count me out . Good . Stay here , Harry . Alone . All alone . I don 't care . On Halloween . Fright night . When the dead become living and the living become dead ! I don 't care . Hi , hi , hi . Trick or treat . Ohhh , Julius and Ethel Rosenberg . Lovely costumes . Very nice . Thanks , dubie . Oh , Harry , you 're an alien . I am not ! I mean ... yes . All right , come on , Tommy . Let 's get out of here . Happy Halloween . Oh no , fudge . My lighter went down the air vent . Oh , hey . Here , I got some matches . Oh , that would get me through this pack , but what am I gonna do for the rest of the night ? Oh , chain smoke . Oh , Dorothy . You look great . Oh , I wanted to come as a flying monkey , but I shaved my legs , and the whole look fell apart . You 're a riot , little darling . Arrr , maties . Heave to whilst I hoist me jolly roger . Dick , you 're a pirate . Oh , thanks a lot . What ? You didn 't have to tell everybody . Who are you supposed to be ? I 'll give you a hint . Dick , I don 't think we 're in Kansas anymore . Of course . Nancy kassebaum . Former republican senator from Kansas . Care for some spinach , cap 'n ? Oh , sure . I don 't really have any spinach . Well , then why did you get my hopes up ? Have you seen Dr. Albright ? Well , what is she dressed like ? Uh , Nancy kassebaum , the former republican senator from Kansas . Uh , we haven 't seen her . Yeah , I would have noticed that . Oh , there she is . She 's mingling with a skeleton . Arrr , look who thinks he 's scary . Well , I be not a-feared of ye , you bag of bones . Now unhand me former wench . Hello , Dick . Dr. Howard ? Shiver me timbers . So , Dick . Where are your buccaneers ? Under my buccan-hat . Dick , I heard you ran out of Dr. Howard 's office today . That 's not true . It 's my word against his . Ahem . It 's Nina 's and my word against his . Oh , give it up . Oh , fine . I left your office . Oh , yeah . Yeah . But it wasn 't out of fear , no . It was out of protest . Oh , this should be good . You doctors . Your A.M.A.s and your H.M.O.s. People treat you like gods . But you 're just a bunch of mountebanks and charlatans , with your " vaccines " and your " penicillins . " Oh , sure , people are healthier now than ever , but at what cost ? Well , I 'll have none of it . Good night , good doctor . Good night . Oh no ! Oh no ! Aah ! Look out , Linus . The great pumpkin 's right behind you . Oh no , no . I can 't take this . This is too scary for me . Wait a second . If that 's not coming from the TV , that can mean only one thing . No harm in watching a little TV . Ok , the way I see it , you put all the candy in the bowl ... you put the bowl out the door ... and you 're through for the night . What do you think of that , Tommy ? Yeah , I like it , considering I just suggested it a minute ago . Don 't sass me , private . Trick or treat . Oh , it 's self-serve , honey . What ? Trick or treat . I just told- - hey , what happened to all the candy ? The pope took it . Nice plan , Tommy . Don 't you have anything else ? Uh , yeah . Give me a second . So , uh ... how are things ? Uh , pretty good . All right . Uh , here you go . What is it ? Half pound of hamburger meat . Enjoy ! Trick or treat . Don 't bother . Alls they got left is beef . Ugh ! Hey ! That better not have been the pope ! That 's it ! You 're toast , pontiff . Oh , Dick ! I 'm so glad you 're home . Oh , yes , home . Where I should have stayed in the first place . No , Dick . It 's worse here . Impossible , Harry . Out there is a room full of people who are all laughing at me . But inside it 's all safe and warm and filled with- - Ghosts . Did I say ghosts ? I 'm afraid so . I 'm afraid , too . Hold me . No Harry . We 're acting silly . How can we be sure we have a ghost ? I 'm sold . Why does this always happen to us ? No , in--in all fairness , Dick , this is our first ghost . That 's true . We 've been very fortunate . Yes , we have . Harry , do you hear that ? Yeah , it sounds like footsteps . They 're coming closer and closer . Yoo-hoo . Dick ? So what do you think , Harry ? 3 by 5 ? Yeah . Dick ? Oh , well , hello , Mary . What 's going on ? Why did you leave the party like that ? I didn 't mean to worry you . You didn 't worry me . You took my car . Where are my keys ? Oh , I 'm sorry about your car , Mary , but there are more important things to worry about . We have a ghost ! Oh , you 're being silly . There 's no such thing as ghosts . Oh , no ? Oh , no ? Yes ! If you want to be scared of something , be scared of what a coward you 've become . And stay out ! Now who 's a coward ? Oh , yeah . I 've seen these before . Jumbo grade " a , " extra large , farm fresh . It doesn 't have the street value of the organic brown , but it 'll do . You 've got the wrong guy , lady . Can I make a phone call ? Shut up ! Listen , kid , we can do this one of two ways . Either you can tell us what we want to know , or you can spend the rest of the night picking shell out of your teeth . Who you workin ' for , punk ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Ok . Let 's start over . No , I 'm going to take this egg and grind it into his face . Lieutenant , you 're out of line . Now go cool off . Ok , I 'm good . I 'm cool . I apologize for my partner . She doesn 't have much patience . Now , me , I want to help you . And I can talk her into going easy on you if you just tell me one thing . Who 's the pope ? ! I don 't know the pope . Maybe I could have seen him at school or something . Well , that 's too bad , kid . Now you 've insulted me . I 'm going for a walk . Sally ? He 's all yours . Kid , right now I wouldn 't trade places with you for the world . So ... how do you like your eggs ? Well , Harry , we haven 't heard from the ghost in quite a while now , so I guess it 's safe to say that it 's vacated the premises . I agree . Oh , Dick ? Hmm-mmm . Is that a ghost coming through the vent ? Yep . Meet you in the living room ? Ok . Who you gonna call , Dick ? Ghostbusters . Are you crazy ? It 's their busiest night of the year . Give me your flashlight . Ok , here 's the deal . The ghost gets the basement , the apartment , and the rambler , and we keep the closet . That seems fair . We can spruce up the place with some yellow slickers . I don 't know what 's the matter with me . I want to be brave but I 'm too afraid . Dick , in order to be brave , you must first start by being afraid . For true courage lies in the overcoming of fear , not in its absence . That 's brilliant , Harry . Who said that ? Blue power ranger . Oh . The grocery store had 4 dozen left . I bought ' em all . Free range . All right . All right . I can 't take it anymore . I 'll tell you everything . Who 's the pope ? The pope is wally Taylor . He lives at 215 west division street . How do we know you 're telling the truth ? I got no reason to lie . Anybody who 'd rat out his friends makes me sick . Get out of here . Run , lady ! They 're crazy . What did you do to the Bernstein boy ? We worked him over . He gave it up . The perp is wally Taylor . All right . Come on , Tommy . We 're through here . Uh , there are no eggs on the outside of my house . They 're all in here . Thank you so much . Ah , don 't thank us . Just doing our job , ma 'am . Aah ! Duck ! What ? Oh , my god ! So it wasn 't the pope . It was batman all along . ♪ Casper , the friendly ghost ♪ ♪ The unfriendliest ghost I know ♪ no , come on , Harry . Keep going . Yeah , more like keep going to the bathroom . Being scared is pointless . It 's just biochemical fuzz in the lint trap of your mind . Whoa ! You 've been bobbing for some funky apples , man . Harry , I 've let fear run my life long enough . I 'm not going to live this way any longer . Intelligent people don 't believe in ghosts . Yeah , they don 't believe in aliens either . Oh , shut up . It 's coming from behind those boxes . Give me a hand , Harry . No . Absolutely not . If the ghost wants to scare us to death , he can just move his own boxes . Will you just do it , Harry ? Did you bring the holy water ? No . Well , what 's that ? Sanka . Is it holy ? Well , I don 't know . But it 's definitely decaffeinated . This is the high commander . By the power vested in me by the maxwell house corporation , I command that you depart from this world and return to your source . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! It 's the ghost of Mrs. Dubcek . Where have you been ? I 've been down here screaming for hours . What are you doing down here ? My lighter went down your vent , I went to look for it in the crawlspace , and I got stuck . Oh . Oh . Well , what about the smoke and the electricity going out ? I couldn 't find my darn lighter , so I had to short out a 220 line to light my cigarette . That reminds me . I need a cigarette . Harry ? Harry , look at me . I 'm not afraid anymore . It 's great . I feel I can accomplish anything I put my mind to . Anything , Harry . Anything . Wow , Dick ! You 've just defeated your own fears . What are you gonna do now ? I 'm going for a routine checkup . I really don 't know what I was so scared about , Dr. Howard . The blood pressure test was a piece of cake . My urine sample was ... plentiful , to say the least . You know , it 's amazing . Once you bring your fears out into the light , you see there 's really nothing to be afraid of . Good to hear it , Dick . You know , in a way , every day is Halloween for us . You mean because we hide behind these bodies , pretending to be something we 're not ? Uh , yeah . So , Tommy , what 's with the mustache ? Well , guys , I 've made a little decision . The mustache stays . Oh , that 's muy macho . You know what I 've learned this Halloween ? That you should always be brave enough to face your fears . Because when you do , it 's only Mrs. Dubcek stuck behind a wall . Always ? Always . Ok , so I know it was Dubcek who was screaming , but did you ever figure out who was rattling those chains ? Oh , yes . That 's the ghost of Mr. Ferguson . Dubcek says he was brutally murdered in our apartment 14 years ago this very night . Oh . Oh . Oh .

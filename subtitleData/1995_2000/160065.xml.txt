 Gideon : GENERAL THOMPSON , YOU DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WE ARE MINUTES AWAY FROM A NEW DESTINATION WITH SOME GOOD LEADS . I DON 'T CARE WHAT YOU 'RE MINUTES AWAY FROM . I HAVE EXPRESS PERMISSION FROM PRESIDENT SHERIDAN TO USE THEEXCALIBUR FOR THIS MISSION . YOU WILL CONTACT ROBERT BLACK AND HIS COLONISTS AND TAKE WHATEVER STEPS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT LEAVE THAT PLANET UNTIL YOU HAVE DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE CARRYING THE DRAKH PLAGUE . IF THE DIAGNOSIS IS POSITIVE , YOU WILL TRANSFER THEM TO AN EARTHFORCE SHIP WAITING NEAR ORION 7 . BUT WHY ? THETA 49 IS UNINHABITED , OR AT LEAST IT WAS UNTIL THEY GOT THERE . IF THESE COLONISTS ARE INFECTED , WHY CAN 'T THEY JUST STAY ON THE PLANET ? TRANSPORTING THEM OUT CREATES ALL KINDS OF LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS , INCLUDING THE RISK OF FURTHER CONTAMINATION . CAPTAIN , I TOLD YOU I WANT THEM IN CUSTODY . I DON 'T NEED TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO A SUBORDINATE . I DON 'T NEED TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO A SUBORDINATE . YES , SIR . Max : I DON 'T LIKE BEING CALLED AND HARASSED . NONETHELESS , I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY RECENT TOPOGRAPHICAL READOUTS , SAMPLES OF ALIEN TECHNOLOGY , OR REPORTS ON ANYTHING YOU HAVE FOUND OUT THERE . ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE OF USE TO OUR ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPEDITIONS . WE NEED PROFIT MARGINS HERE , MAX . I KNOW . IPX DEPENDS ON THE INFORMATION FROM OUR SCOUTS . I KNOW , I KNOW . I 'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY BUSY . NOT TO MENTION THE HALF-DOZEN LIFE-THREATENING SITUATIONS THAT I 'VE BEEN IN IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS . THIS ISN 'T A DEBATE . YOU ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE IN YOUR CORPORATE UPDATES . THE NEXT MISSION YOU GO ON- - TRUST ME . THE NEXT PLACE PROMISES TO BE A GOLD MINE . YOU 'LL GET A FULL REPORT . WE 'D BETTER . WE 'D BETTER . P.A. : YOUR ATTENTION , PLEASE ... I UNDERSTAND WE 'RE CHANGING COURSE . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? WE 'RE GOING TO THETA 49 , ORION SECTOR . WHY ? THE PREVIOUS COORDINATES PROMISED TO BE A VERITABLE GOLD MINE OF ALIEN TECHNOLOGY . ORION SYSTEM ... THETA 49 ... LOOKS INCREDIBLY DULL . THIS ORDER CAME DIRECTLY FROM EARTHFORCE . OH , THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE DULL PART . IF THIS ISN 'T A PLANET THAT IPX CAN 'T EXPLOIT FOR PROFIT , THEN MAYBE THIS IS YOUR CUE TO TAKE A VACATION . IPX DOESN 'T GIVE PAID HOLIDAYS . FOR A CAUSE LIKE THIS , I 'D THINK WE 'D ALL HAPPILY CHIP IN . I 'D THINK WE 'D ALL HAPPILY CHIP IN . I JUST GOT THE WORD . WHAT 'S ON THETA 49 ? APPROXIMATELY 30 PEOPLE WHO ESCAPED FROM EARTH DURING THE DRAKH ATTACK . IF THEY WEREN 'T ABLE TO GET OFFWORLD BEFORE THE PLAGUE WAS RELEASED , THEN THEY 'RE INFECTED . THEY COULD BE CARRYING THIS PLAGUE ALL OVER THE GALAXY . THEY COULD BE CARRYING THIS PLAGUE ALL OVER THE GALAXY . I HEAR YOU WANTED TO SPEAK WITH ME . HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION ? YES . WE ROLLED THE STONES , AND THEY CAME UP BLANK . NEVER IN OUR HISTORY ... HAS THERE BEEN SUCH A TERRIBLE SIGN . WE MEAN YOUR PEOPLE NO HARM . WE MEAN YOUR PEOPLE NO HARM . ROLL YOUR STONES AGAIN . YOU 'LL SEE I 'M TELLING THE TRUTH . NO . OUR STONES HAVE SPOKEN . ON THE EVE OF THIS , MY DEATH , I HEAR WHISPERS OF A TERRIBLE CURSE . A TRAGEDY WAS BROUGHT TO MY PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE . BY COMING HERE , YOU BROUGHT DOOM TO MY PEOPLE . THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO BE SAID BETWEEN US THAT THE STONES HAVE NOT SAID FOR US . GO NOW ... FOR I MUST DIE . PLEASE TAKE AWAY YOUR PEOPLE SO THAT MINE CAN LIVE . SO THAT MINE CAN LIVE . MATTHEW GIDEON , CAPTAIN . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR .

JUST DON 'T EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING DOWN THERE . WE CAN 'T GUARD AGAINST SECONDARY CONTAMINATION . THE TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON RATS . HOW DO I KNOW IT 'S GOING TO WORK ON ME ? WELL , TO ANSWER THAT , WE 'D HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RAT AND A STARSHIP CAPTAIN , AND , WELL , I DON 'T THINK WE HAVE THAT MUCH TIME . WE HAVE THAT MUCH TIME .

BRING ON THE REST OF THE RATS . BRING ON THE REST OF THE RATS . Tim : I TOLD YOU BLACK ISN 'T HERE . AND UNTIL HE GETS HERE , YOU 'LL GET NOTHING FROM US . I DON 'T BUY THIS STORY ABOUT US BEING INFECTED BY THE PLAGUE BEFORE LEAVING THE EARTH . YOU LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR . YOUR SHIP WAS IN THE AREA WHERE THE DRAKH RELEASED A PLAGUE- - AFTER WE TOOK OFF . LOOK ... IT TOOK US 6 MONTHS TO FIND THIS PLACE . WE 'RE NOT LEAVING NOW . YOU 'RE JUST TRYING TO GET US TO GO BACK TO EARTH BECAUSE WE EMBARRASSED THE POLITICIANS BACK HOME . THERE ARE ONLY 30 OF YOU . THAT 'S NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT A PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN . NO ? WELL , WHAT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN ? LOOK AT YOU ... RUNNING AROUND , PRETENDING TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS . RUNNING OFF TO ANOTHER MISSION , ANOTHER WAR . THE HUMAN RACE DOESN 'T MEASURE THE QUALITY OF WHAT IT 'S ACCOMPLISHED , ONLY THE QUANTITY . THE NUMBERS- - HOW MUCH CAN WE DO BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE CAN ? AND WE LEFT , BECAUSE WE HAVE TIRED OF HAVING OUR FUTURES DICTATED AT A BREAKNECK PACE . THE EARTH HAS BEEN SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL FOR A LONG TIME , CAPTAIN , BUT OUR WORLD WILL REMAIN CONSTANT AND OUR QUALITY OF LIFE SOMETHING WE 'RE PROUD OF . WE 'LL BE HERE LONG AFTER EARTH IS JUST A MEMORY . MAYBE THAT 'S THE LESSON OF THE DRAKH PLAGUE . SLOW DOWN AND ENJOY LIFE , OR IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM YOU . MAYBE THAT 'S WHY WE WERE SPARED TO COME HERE . I 'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE PHILOSOPHY WITH YOU . I HAVE MY ORDERS . Tim : AND WHAT ORDERS ARE THOSE ? I 'M ROBERT BLACK . I SUPPOSE YOU CAN SAY I 'M A DESIGNATED TOWN SPOKESMAN . MR. BLACK , WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU AND YOUR COLONISTS MAY HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY A HIGHLY ADVANCED PLAGUE . IT WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE EARTH 'S ATMOSPHERE AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME YOU LEFT . IT 'S A TRICK . THEY 'RE TRYING TO PRE- - IT 'S A TRICK . THEY 'RE TRYING TO PRE- - YOU WERE SAYING ? I NEED TO TAKE BLOOD SAMPLES FROM ALL OF YOU . NO . YOU CAN SAMPLE ME AND ONLY ME . IF ONE OF US HAS IT , THEN WE 'D ALL HAVE IT BY NOW . IF I TEST POSITIVE , YOU CAN HAVE OTHERS . BUT I 'M SURE YOU 'LL FIND WE 'RE NOT INFECTED . BUT I 'M SURE YOU 'LL FIND WE 'RE NOT INFECTED . I 'M SORRY ABOUT THE PLAGUE , BUT IT REALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US . WE CAME HERE TO START OVER , AND YOUR TROUBLES- - YOUR PRESENCE IS INTERFERING WITH THAT . BUT , IF COOPERATION WILL GET RID OF YOU SOONER THAN OPPOSITION , YOU CAN HAVE OUR COOPERATION ... FOR NOW . PLEASE FOLLOW ME . PLEASE FOLLOW ME . [ DELIRIOUS MURMURING ] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? DO YOU NEED HELP ? [ BREATHING DEEPLY ] NO , YOUNG ONE . THE TWILIGHT WILL SOON BECOME NIGHT . IT 'S ... IT 'S THE WAY OF THINGS . THIS WAS THE WAY OF MY PEOPLE AS WELL . I ALWAYS WONDERED IF IT WOULD BE HARD TO DIE ALONE WHEN MY TIME CAME . WHEN I WAS YOUNG , I WAS AFRAID OF THE JOURNEY INTO NIGHT , I DIDN 'T WANT TO DIE ALONE . THOUGH I HAVE NO CHOICE . THERE IS NO ONE LEFT TO WATCH OVER ME . I 'M THE LAST OF MY KIND . I CAN STAY , THOUGH , AND WATCH FOR YOU , IF YOU WANT . AND WATCH FOR YOU , IF YOU WANT . WHO ARE YOU , YOUNG ONE ? YOU 'RE NOT FROM OUR VILLAGE . YOU MUST BE ...

WE 'LL HAVE THE RESULTS BACK IN A FEW HOURS . JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE , IF I WERE YOU , I 'D BE READY TO PACK MY BAGS AND RETURN TO EARTH . WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO RETURN . IT 'S NOT YOUR CHOICE . YOU CAN DESTROY OUR SHIP . I GUARANTEE YOU WE CAN 'T LEAVE . EARTH WON 'T TAKE THE RISK . OTHER RACES MIGHT STILL COME HERE , AND WE DON 'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO POST TROOPS TO GUARD A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE . YOU 'RE JUST LUCKY YOU CAME TO AN ISOLATED LOCATION . THERE 'S NO ONE ELSE HERE TO CONTAMINATE . WE 'LL BE BACK IN A FEW HOURS . TELL YOUR PEOPLE TO GET READY . TELL YOUR PEOPLE TO GET READY . YOU 'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM TAKE US BACK , ARE YOU ? HE 'S RIGHT , TIM . IF WE 'RE INFECTED , WE 'RE A THREAT TO EVERYONE . DON 'T DO THIS , NOT AFTER ALL WE FOUGHT FOR . WE BARELY ESCAPED EARTH , ARE YOU SAYING THAT OUR FREEDOM DOESN 'T MEAN A DAMN THING NOW ? TIM , YOU DON 'T HAVE ALL THE PIECES . I MET WITH A TRIBAL ELDER . HE TOLD ME THAT WE BRING DESTRUCTION . I COULDN 'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT ... TILL THEY SHOWED UP . AND YOU BELIEVE HIM ? SYNCHRONICITY LIKE THIS ? IT 'S THE FIRST SIGN OF BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME . THEN LET 'S LEAVE . WHY ARE WE WAITING FOR AN ESCORT ? EARTHFORCE WILL JUST USE US AS LAB RATS AGAIN , AND THAT CAPTAIN PROBABLY KNOWS WHO AND WHAT WE ARE . NOW I WON 'T BE LOCKED UP ANYMORE . IF WE 'RE INFECTED , WE SHOULDN 'T GO ANYWHERE . WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE TIME ... ENOUGH TO THINK OF OTHER STRATEGIES . LIKE WHAT ? SURRENDER ? SURRENDER ? MUST BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU BEING A CAREER MILITARY OFFICER , HAVING TO PLAY THE ROLES OF JAILER , FERRYMAN , EXECUTIONER . THAT 'S WHERE WE 'RE DIFFERENT . I JUST DO WHAT I 'M TOLD . THE CORPORATION KNOWS ALL , SEES ALL , AND TELLS VERY LITTLE . IF WE MAKE A BAD CALL , WE CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT WE 'VE ACTED IN GOOD CONSCIENCE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE . ABSOLUTIONIN ABSENTIA . THE BLESSED STATE OF BEING ABLE TO SAY THAT IT 'S NOT MY FAULT . THAT IT 'S NOT MY FAULT . GAINING THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL WAS THE FIRST ORIGINAL SIN , REMEMBER ? WAS THE FIRST ORIGINAL SIN , REMEMBER ? HOW MUCH BETTER OF A WORLD IT WOULD BE IF THEY HADN 'T FORMED AN OPINION , IF THEY HAD JUST EATEN OF THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT OF KNOWLEDGE . OPINION DOESN 'T ENTER INTO IT . RECENTLY , I EVEN GET A PERVERSE PLEASURE OUT OF THAT . A PERVERSE PLEASURE OUT OF THAT . [ BEEP BEEP ] Gideon : DUREENA . YEAH . WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE ?

WE 'VE GIVEN THEM 3 HOURS TO GET THEIR EQUIPMENT TOGETHER . THAT 'S EXTREMELY GENEROUS . THEY AREN 'T IN IMMEDIATE DANGER , SIR . IN FACT , THEY 'RE WONDERING WHY THEY JUST CAN 'T BE QUARANTINED ON THE PLANET UNTIL WE CAN FIND A CURE . GRANTED , THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES . ABSOLUTELY NOT . THE TIME AND COST TO MAINTAIN A QUARANTINE ISN 'T VIABLE . BEFORE THE COLONISTS MOVE OUT , I WANT THE RECORD OF THEIR SHIP 'S HISTORY UPLINKED TO MY OFFICE . WE SHOULD KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE MIGHT NEED TO BE QUARANTINED ALONG THE WAY . YES , SIR . AFTER YOU UPLOAD THE INFORMATION TO ME , YOU WILL ERASE THE SHIP 'S LOG . WE DON 'T WANT ANYONE ELSE STUMBLING ONTO THOSE RECORDS . GOD KNOWS WHAT NONSENSE THEY 'VE PUT IN THERE . BUT , SIR- - THAT 'S ALL , CAPTAIN . THAT 'S ALL , CAPTAIN . [ CHIMES ] ENTER . ENTER . I 'M ABOUT TO HEAD DOWN TO THE PLANET , BUT BEFORE THAT I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHILE I WAS DOING MY WORK ON THE COLONISTS , I CAME ACROSS A CYBERORGANIC COMPOUND IN THEIR BLOODSTREAM .

I 'M RUNNING SOME TESTS NOW , BUT WON 'T HAVE ANYTHING SOLID FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS . I SEE . ALL RIGHT . THANK YOU . ALL RIGHT . THANK YOU . CAPTAIN TO TEAM ONE . Crewman : YES , SIR .

I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN TO US FOR GENERATIONS . WE WERE TAKEN AS LABOR TO HELP TO FORM A COLONY BY THE STARSHIPQUALTHAM . IT WAS WHEN OUR PEOPLE WERE FIRST TAKEN TO THE STARS BY OTHERS . THERE WAS A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT BEFORE WE COULD ARRIVE AT OUR DESTINATION . SOMETHING APPEARED NEAR OUR SHIP , AND WITH WEAPONS OF GREAT DESTRUCTION , NEARLY DESTROYED OUR VESSEL . WHEN THE SHIP WAS DAMAGED , OUR ESCAPE PODS LANDED ON THIS PLANET . THOSE OF US WHO MANAGED TO ESCAPE EVENTUALLY GATHERED HERE , BUT ... WE HAD NO COMMUNICATIONS , NO ... RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED , AND ... SO WE WERE SOON FORGOTTEN . SO WE WERE SOON FORGOTTEN . A LOST TRIBE . A LOST TRIBE . [ BEEP BEEP ] YES ? Gideon : DOCTOR , COULD YOU SWING BY THE COLONISTS ' SHIP ON YOUR WAY IN AND TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEM ? CHARMING .

Gideon : THAT CONFIRMS WHAT I FOUND HERE . ACCORDING TO THE SHIP 'S LOG , THE COLONISTS DID GET OFF EARTH BEFORE THE PLAGUE WAS RELEASED . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . IF THE PLAGUE HAD BROKEN OUT AT WHATEVER SUPPLY BASE THIS CAME FROM , WE 'D HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT . BUT THIS FOOD IS DEFINITELY CONTAMINATED . IS THAT POSSIBLE ? NO . NOT UNLESS ... NOT UNLESS ... UNLESS IT WAS DELIBERATELY CONTAMINATED . DELIBERATELY CONTAMINATED . IF THE COLONISTS WERE DELIBERATELY CONTAMINATED , THEN WHO DID IT , AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM ? WELL , THE PACKAGE SAYS IT WAS MANUFACTURED BY PRO-ZETA CORPORATION . NEVER HEARD OF IT . PROBABLY SOME LOW-GRADE FOOD OR BLACK MARKET DROP THAT COULD BE SOLD QUICK AND CHEAP WITHOUT ANY QUARANTINE . MAYBE . MAYBE NOT . I 'M GOING TO TRY AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS PRO-ZETA CORPORATION . I THINK I KNOW JUST THE PERSON TO HELP LOOK INTO IT . YOU BETTER GET ON UP HERE .

REASONABLE IS THAT YOU HEAD BACK TO THE SHUTTLE AND YOU FINISH THEIR TESTS , PRETEND YOU WERE EXAMINING THE WILDLIFE OR SOMETHING TO SEE IF THEY WERE INFECTED .

MY GUESS IS THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE TRUTH GETTING OUT WHEN YOU DID , SO HE DECIDED TO COVER HIS ASS . SO HE ARRANGED TO GET INFECTED SHIPMENTS OF FOOD ONTO YOUR SHIP WHILE YOU STOPPED FOR SUPPLIES ON THE LAST LEG OF YOUR TRIP HERE . SO WHAT EARTHFORCE COULDN 'T HAVE , THEY WANTED TO DESTROY . DESPITE THE FACT THAT EARTH WAS DYING , ALL THEY REALLY CARED ABOUT WAS KEEPING THEIR DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS . I DON 'T WANT TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION , SO I 'M GIVING YOU A CHANCE .

THE CAPTAIN USED A SUBCHANNEL TO SEND US INFORMATION HE DISCOVERED ABOUT OUR CYBERNETIC ENHANCEMENTS . HE ALSO SHOWED US THAT WE WERE INFECTED BY EARTHFORCE . WE THEN LEFT THE SHIP BEFORE IT WAS DESTROYED . MY ORDERS WERE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON 'T SPREAD THE INFECTION . WITHOUT YOUR SHIP , THAT PROBLEM IS SOLVED .

THEN ONE DAY I WAS PLAYING A GAME OF SHARKS AGAINST ONE OF THESE ... INDIVIDUALS ... WE WERE 4 SHEETS TO THE WIND , COULD BARELY HOLD THE DICE , AND WE DECIDED TO ... RAISE THE STAKES . WE PLAYED FOR ACCESS TO HIS SECURITY CODES . HE LOST . I 'VE NEVER COMPROMISED HIS POSITION , BUT ... THEY DO COME IN HANDY FROM TIME TO TIME . THEY DO COME IN HANDY FROM TIME TO TIME . AH , THERE . AH , THERE . NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR COLLATERAL . NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR COLLATERAL . BUT EVEN WITHOUT THAT , I WOULDN 'T COMPROMISE YOUR PEOPLE , DUREENA . I MAY PALM A CARD OFF THE TABLE FROM TIME TO TIME , BUT KILLING OFF YOUR TRUST ... ISN 'T A FAIR GAME . ISN 'T A FAIR GAME . WELL , MAX , IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY , JUST SAY IT . WELL , I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE MAP ROOM , AND I NOTICED A NUMBER OF LIFE FORMS VERY SIMILAR TO DUREENA 'S ON THE SCANNER WHEN SHE CALLED YOU DOWN TO CHECK OUT THE FAUNA . DON 'T YOU THINK YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE CAPTAIN TO TELL HIM WHAT YOU FOUND ? WHO YOU FOUND ? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I HAVEN 'T ? THEN YOU WON 'T MIND IF I TELL MY PEOPLE ? MAX , THAT 'S MY CALL , NOT YOURS . THE FOLKS BACK HOME SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS . THIS IS A DECISION THAT MEANS THE CONTINUATION OR THE EXTINCTION OF AN ENTIRE RACE . DUREENA 'S RACE . DON 'T YOU THINK I REALIZE THAT ? I DON 'T NEED YOU TO HELP ME MAKE A DECISION LIKE THIS . YOU 'RE THE ONE BUTTING IN WHERE YOU DON 'T BELONG . NOW I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN , BUT I KNOW FULL WELL WHAT 'S MOTIVATING IT . BUT I KNOW FULL WELL WHAT 'S MOTIVATING IT . YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE CREDIT FOR FINDING THEM . YOU HAVE NO REAL COMPASSION , JUST A WALLET WHERE YOUR HEART SHOULD BE . NOW IF YOU DON 'T MIND ... I HAVE WORK TO DO . I HAVE WORK TO DO . IT 'S LATE . I WASN 'T EXPECTING ANYONE TO COME BY . ESPECIALLY YOU . YEAH , I KNOW . I CAME BY BECAUSE ... I CAME BY BECAUSE ... I MAY HAVE BEEN MORE UPSET THAN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK ON THE PLANET , SO ... YOU KNOW , I FIGURED I 'D STOP BY . YOU 'RE FORGIVEN . YOU 'RE FORGIVEN . ABOUT MY PEOPLE ... AND--AND THE PLAGUE . HOW ... HOW MUCH TIME DO THEY HAVE LEFT ? HOW MUCH TIME DO THEY HAVE LEFT ? ONE YEAR . ONE YEAR . I 'M SORRY . I FINISHED THE FINAL ANALYSIS . THE PLAGUE USES A TEMPLATE AS A BASE . WHILE IT WORKS SLOW ON HUMAN BIOLOGY , IT WORKS FASTER ON YOUR SPECIES THAN OURS . IT WORKS FASTER ON YOUR SPECIES THAN OURS . YOU WERE RIGHT ... ABOUT DOUBLING OUR EFFORTS . I 'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN FOR YOUR PEOPLE . I SWEAR IT ON MY LIFE . NO . SWEAR IT ON THEIRS . SWEAR IT ON THEIRS . Max : TO CLOSE MY REPORT , I 'D LIKE TO MAKE ONE NOTE FOR THE RECORD . THAT NOT ALL OF THE COLONISTS ON THETA 49 WERE KILLED IN THE EXPLOSION TODAY . A DETAILED SURFACE SCAN OF THE PLANET INDICATES THAT THERE IS ANOTHER RACE LIVING THERE AS WELL , SUGGEST THAT THE CORPORATION CHECK IT OUT ONE OF THESE DAYS . Computer : REPORT COMPLETE . READY TO SEND . READY TO SEND . Computer : LAST ENTRY DELETED . Computer : LAST ENTRY DELETED . TO CLOSE MY REPORT , WE FOUND NOTHING OF INTEREST ON THETA 49 . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS .

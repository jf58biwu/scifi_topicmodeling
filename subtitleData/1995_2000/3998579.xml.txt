 I 'm singing in the rain Just singing in the rain What a glorious feeling I 'm happy again Whoa ! Let the stormy clouds chase Everyone from the place I 'm laughing at clouds So dark up above The sun 's in my eyes And I 'm ready for love Come on , bring on that rain I 'm happy again Come on with the rain There 's a smile on my face I 'm dancing with worms Whoa ! A permit ? Damn ! How do you say " permit " ? I have a permit . - Dr. Niko Tapopopolis ? - It 's Tatopoulos . Kyle Terrington . I 'm with the U.S. State Department . - What are they doing ? - You 're being reassigned . But my work here isn 't finished . It is now . There 's pressure from the Americans . What have you told them ? Nothing yet . Are there any survivors ? Only one , sir . He was lucky . Get them out . Ask him what happened . What did you see , old man ? That 's affirmative . Hey , where you going with my stuff ? Hello ? Hello . That 's very delicate . Thank you . Dr. Niko Topodopeles ? - It 's Tatopoulos . - Whatever . Come on . Get these people off the pier . - Excuse me sir , do you mind telling me what am I doing here ? - Watch your step . Don 't talk to anybody . Come on . Get them off the damn pier ! - What is all this , some kind of spill ? - Yeah . Something like that . Look I work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ... but accidents and spills are not my field . We know . Do you know you 've interrupted a study of the Chernobyl earthworm ? Yeah , you 're the worm guy , right ? Radioactive contamination in that area has mutated the earthworm 's DNA . - You know what that means ? - No . But I got a feeling I 'm about to find out . It means that because of a man-made accident ... Chernobyl earthworms are now 17 % larger than they were before . 17 % , huh ? Sounds pretty big . They 're enormous . That 's what I 'm trying to say . I 'm a biologist . I take radioactive samples and I study them . That 's great . Here 's your sample . - Study it . - What sample ? - You 're standing in it . - I don 't see it . Where is it ? I don 't see it . Colonel ! Colonel ! That was a footprint ! I was standing inside of a footprint . That 's right . But there 's no animal in the world that makes footprints like that , is there ? I told them this is not your field , but they never listen to genius . Nick , this is Elsie Chapman of the National Institute of Paleontology . She 's your boss . - Those were footprints , right ? - Yes , they were . - Anybody see what made them ? - Actually , no such luck . Well , it happened so fast , nobody knew what hit them until it was over . - Elsie ? - Yeah ? Tape 's in . The French finally released it . This is a Japanese cannery ship that was attacked and sunk near French Polynesia . We believe it 's connected . By the way Dr. Craven , have you met the " worm guy " ? Oh , sorry . Summer cold . Come on , come on ! All right ? Have a nice day . Oh , wait , wait , wait ! - They 're saying it 's supposed to rain like this , all week . - What 's with the bags ? Caiman 's groceries . Oh , girl ! - Speak of the devil . - What ? This is the midget version . This one makes me look like a trained professional . Can we put this on the 5 : 00 , please ? - You think I should ask him ? - No . - I 'm gonna ask him . - No ! - I will . - Audrey . - Did you talk with Humphries ? - This is not the place . - Just tell me . Did you talk with him ? - He said he 'd consider it . It 's between you and Rodriguez . You serious ? He 's gonna consider me for the job ? What else did he say ? Well . Why don 't we talk about it over dinner tonight ? Your place . Mr. Caiman , you 're married . Yes , and you 're very beautiful . Have I ever told you that before ? Mr. Caiman ! I 've been doing research for you after hours and weekends for over three years . This is a very important job to me . I 'm too old to be your assistant anymore . I need to know this job is going someplace . So , have dinner with me tonight . I can 't . It 's your choice . - Okay , let 's go . - Charlie ? - Say hello to your new co-anchor , Ms. Desireé Pon . - Hello , Desireé , welcome aboard . Welcome aboard . - Mark , can I have a pillow , something ? - Alright . In five . Four . Three . Two . Hello , New York . Today at 5 we 'll ask Fat Pat , " For when will this rain end ? " So three years digging up worms in Chernobyl , was it ? How did Mrs. Tatapolis handle that ? It 's Tatopoulos . I 'm actually not married . Really ? A girlfriend ? No . Perhaps I work too much . So do you mean to tell me there 's no one who holds a special place in your heart ? No . Not for a long time now . Well , you may be the wrong man for the job , ... but I think you 're cute . Oh . Thank you . She thinks I 'm cute . Who the hell are they ? Seargent , get those people out of there . - They 're with me . - Is that right ? - Who are you ? - La Rochelle Casualty and Property Insurance . - We 're preparing our report . - You 're pretty damn fast . That 's our job . Well , your people are getting in the way of my job . Colonel , what do you think could have done this ? Listen , Mr. Roach , you get your people out of here , or I will . - Captain 's getting a cup of coffee . - Don 't take too long . - Then he 'll come and kick your ass . - Yeah ! I 'm in for a buck . What the hell is that dope-head doing ? Artie ! - Artie , why are we slowing down ? - I don 't know . She 's at full throttle . Maybe she 's heavy in the net . Yo ! How come we stopped ? Are the nets full ? I don 't think so . We must be caught on something . Bring in the nets . Pull ' em in now . - What 's going on ? - We 're bringing them in ! The energy engines are heating up . - Should I shut them down ? - No ! Keep pulling ! Come on ! Bring ' em ! I 'm trying . I 'm trying ! Cut ' em loose ! Cut the net ! Look out ! Cut loose now ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Jump ! Abandon ship ! Let her go ! You hear that ? Excuse me , sir . We just got a report of three fishing trawlers going down . - What makes you think it 's related ? - The trawlers were pulled under , sir . Jesus Christ ! It 's only 200 miles off the Eastern seaboard and we don 't even know what the hell it is . - It 's Theropoda Allosarus . - What ? Some type of enormous reptile that we believed died out in the Cretaceous Period . So where 's it been hiding the last 60 million years ? What about the traces of radiation ? The radiation isn 't an anomaly . It 's the clue . This animal is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur . Don 't tell me what it isn 't , and tell me what the hell it is . What do we know ? It was first sighted ... off the French Polynesian Pacific , right ? That area has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the past 30 years . Hence the radiation . No , more than that . I believe that this is a mutated aberration . A hybrid caused by the fallout on these islands . Like your earthworms ? Yes . Yes . We 're looking at a completely incipient creature . The dawn of a new species . The first of its kind . My life sucks . Oh , please ! Your life doesn 't suck . - His life sucks . - ' Cause I 'm married to you . I cannot believe he put the moves on me after everything I 've done for him . He is scum ! As far as he 's concerned , you 're just a pair of breasts that talk . - Hey , there 's an image . - I 'm telling you . He is dirt ! He 's a douche bag , gutter slime , dog crap , puke chunks . I 'm eating . You don 't see I 'm eating ? Audrey , you 're too damn nice . That 's your problem . Nice gets you nothing in this town . It 's dog eat dog . You gotta be a killer to get ahead . You know what I 'm saying ? I 'm sorry , baby , but you just don 't got what it takes . - You don 't think that 's true , do you , Animal ? - Yeah . Pretty much . You 're a nice person , you know . Nice guys finish last . - Well I can be tough if I want . - Yeah , sure . I can ! - I can . - No , yeah . Whatever . Oh , my God ! Could you turn that up , please ? - It 's Nick ! - Who is he ? He was my college sweetie . He looks so handsome on TV . There seems to be an unusually tight security around the crash site ... possibly because of the highly sensitive military cargo on the plane . Fellas , you want to unload this , please ? I 'm getting soaked ! Come on , will ya ? Joe , gonna catch one of them little fish in the East River ? I hope so . You never know . I mean , today could be my lucky day . The only thing you 're gonna catch is a cold ! I got a bite ! Boy , do I have a bite ! Hold on , Joe . You got a big one , baby . Hold on to it now . You wanna fight ? Here he is , ladies and gentlemen , the man you 've all been waiting for . Your 's for a safer New York . Your mayor , Mayor Ebert ! Thank you ! I want to thank all of you for coming on this beautiful New York City day ! When I first came into office four years ago ... people didn 't think that I would reduce crime . But I did ! Oh , my God ! Move it ! Let 's get out of here ! I am grateful for the bank that we 're getting a new set . I know that represents a commitment on the part management . Here is what I don 't understand is why we 're the only station in town ... that doesn 't have the Korean grocery holdup as our lead . I mean , what 's our lead ? Rain ! Again ! Mom ? Sorry . I don 't give a rat 's ass about a war ... in some country whose name I can 't even pronounce ! How about a real story ? Sir , I think your story just walked by the window . What ? Maybe we can get in the Korean grocer 's hospital room . So did this Romeo have a name ? Nick Tatopoulos . - Jesus ! Is that why you dumped him ? - No . How long did you guys go out for , anyway ? Nearly four years . Girl , I 'm surprised he didn 't ask you to marry him . That 's the problem . He did . Tell me that 's not another parade . I don 't think that 's a parade . Please stand by . What the hell is that ? Are you all right ? Are you cut ? You all right ? Victor ! - Don 't be stupid ! - Oh , my ! Jesus , Mary and Joseph ! That is really- - That is large . Oh , my God ! Come on , you bastard ! Come on . Jeez ! Victor , get back here , you retard ! Somebody do something ! Sergeant O 'Neal , sir ! Any word from the mayor 's office ? Yes , sir . They 've agreed to evacuate the city and called out the National Guard . Wait . Evacuate Manhattan ? That 's over three million people . - Has that ever been done before ? - I don 't think so . - Where is he now ? - We lost sight of it , sir . You want to run that by me again ? After its initial attack ... he disappeared . Secretary of Defense Burk is on the line . I don 't understand . How could something so big just disappear ? - We 're not sure , but we 're scanning- - - He probably returned to the river . Well I don 't think so . I mean , look at it . It 's perfect . An island , water on all sides , but like no other island in the world . This is a place where he can easily hide . He 's in there someplace . Channel 12 caught it on tape . Hello . I 'm Charles Caiman in the WIDF News Center . Ladies and gentlemen , we New Yorkers like to think ... we 've seen it all , but what you going to see right now will shock you beyond belief . This is footage we have that indicates that ... there is a dinosaur loose in Manhattan . WIDF 's exclusive footage was shot barely half an hour ago . WIDF cameraman Victor " Animal " Palotti survived unharmed . Great stuff , Animal . Weren 't you scared ? Yeah . Thought Lucy was gonna kill me . Damn right , you crazy wop ! Okay , people , we have to be completely relocated to the New Jersey station for the 10 : 00 broadcast . Animal ! You 're riding in the chopper with Caiman . Let 's go . Lift off . You going to be all right ? Audrey 's going to spend the night with us . Cool . A threesome . That 's excellent . I 'm a little tired- - Dozens of people are reported killed , thousands of others injured . Civil defense stations are being set up throughout the island of Manhattan . But in addition , city , military ... and health officials are setting up a command post ... on the Jersey shore in anticipation of an evacuation . My bag . My bag ! Mr. Caiman ! Mr. Caiman , wait . Mr. Caiman I 've got a lead . - I know a guy on the inside with the military . - Not now . You don 't understand . I can get us some great inside information . Look this is the moment when the big boys go to work . Okay , honey ? Bag . This is crazy ! Come on . Come on , let 's go . Wait up . - Can we get a cab ? - Audrey , what are you thinking ? Go , go ! In what city officials are describing as the worst act of destruction since the World Trade Center bombing ... hundreds of thousands of people have jammed the streets ... in the largest evacuation in this city 's history . And many people , many , many people are not happy about it . Among those unhappy citizens are the managers of the stores ... along pricey Fifth and Madison Avenue . The Warner Bros. and Disney stores have been totally cleared out by looters . And the streets are jammed . Traffic is at a standstill . Emergency vehicles cannot have access to any emergency that may develop . And there is a slow but steady stream out of the city ... as if Long Island or New Jersey were any refuge in this time of crisis . Well this is great ! If I 'm wrong on this evacuation , they 'll string me up from the Liberty torch . Didn 't we agree that we weren 't to have any sweets until after the election ? Back off , Gene . - Mr. Mayor . - Who are they ? It 's a contingent of building owners and business representatives from the community . - I don 't have time for this nonsense . - Campaign contributors ! Ladies and gentlemen , I share your concerns . I want to get this city back in business as soon as possible . Please . La Rochelle Insurance . We represent nearly 13 % of the buildings in your city . You can count on our emotional and financial support . Thank you . What do you plan to do ? - Coming through . - Where 's your I.D. ? - What 's the matter ? Don 't you watch TV ? - You need press I.D. I 've got l.D. I had a badge on my bag . Right here . I don 't know if this is a very good idea , Lucy . What are you talking about ? You stole it . Finally you got a little chutzpah . Don 't wimp out on me . What if Caiman finds out ? Look , how often you think you can have an ex-boyfriend on the inside of a major story ? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . If I could just stick this thing . You got any glue or something ? I 'm sorry . I left my forgery kit at the office . - No croissant ? - No , monsieur . Ah , you call this coffee ? No , I call this America . I 'm sorry , Mr. Mayor , but that 's where we are at this moment . Now hold on . Hold on . You 're telling me that in an election month I 've evacuated this entire city for nothing ? Do you realize what this evacuation is gonna cost the people of this city ? We have been monitoring all the waters around the island . - As far as we can tell , this thing has not left the area . - Yes . But you don 't know for sure . We have a strong reason to believe it may be hiding ... inside one of the buildings within the restricted area . - But you don 't know for sure ! - Mr. Mayor . We cannot give the " all clear " until each and every one of these building has been checked . - What is it ? - Excuse me , sir . - That may be more difficult than we originally projected . - Terrific . Terrific ! More good news . We 've run into a problem . - Do you believe this ? - I don 't know what 's going on . - You never know what 's going on . - Thank you . - Here , sir . - Fall in . Let 's go , people . Fall in downstairs . Lieutenant Anderson and his men found this , this afternoon . We were checking the office building above when we discovered the floor was gone . When we discovered he could burrow through the tunnels , we realized that ... we realized he could be outside the quarantine zone . Holy Christ ! How many tunnels lead off the island ? Only 14 sir . We 've checked them all . He hasn 't used any of them . - Have them all sealed up . - Yes , sir . How ? How would we do that , sir ? You fill them with cement . Brick them up . Put land mines in them , bombs . I don 't care ! Make sure the damn thing doesn 't leave the island ! Yes , sir . You know , he 's not some enemy trying to evade you . - He 's just an animal . - What are you suggesting ? Well when I had to catch earthworms ... I knew that the best way to get them was not to dig them out , but to draw them out . All we need to do is to find out what he needs ... and he 'll come to you . Where are they now ? Delta Niner , what is convoy position ? Command , they have just entered the city . I have no radio contact with the convoy . I 'm expecting ground confirmation right now . - Convoy ETA ten minutes , sir . - Alright . We 've got to hurry . Here we go . Man your positions now . Ten minutes to ETA . Go , go , go ! All systems go ! Is it good ? Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on , coming through ! Put it down . You said this was French Roast ! More cream . Bring ' em in ! Come on . Bring ' em back . I hope this plan of yours works . I 'm hoping that myself . - Did you give approval for this ? - They just appropriated it . Twelve of the city dump trucks ? Would you like to tell me what 's going on around here ? Actually , no , I wouldn 't . And don 't touch anything . - How 's O 'Neal doing ? - Everything is on schedule Sir . - You sure you didn 't know about this ? - No . No one told me anything about this . Why do I been keeping you around ? Dump ! No . Very clever . Let 's pile it on and let 's get out of here . That 's a lot of fish . Come on , you bastard , it 's supper time . Look at all that frigging fish . Is this gonna work ? We gotta get these manholes uncovered . We want him to smell the bait . Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on , guys . Get those lids off . Go ! What the hell is he doing ? Okay , this way . - Come on . - You heard him . Let 's go . Come on ! Over there ! This one . Give me the crowbar . Set up here . It 's your best shot . This is 6-Alpha Charlie . We can 't stay put ! We gotta move ! We need bigger guns . - We 've lost communications sir . - Get us back on-line . Fire at will ! - Seargent Fire at will . - Fire , fire ! O 'Neal , you got to tell me , what the hell is going on ? He 's gone , sir . He 's gone . Echo unit in pursuit . Follow my lead . - All systems armed . - Echo 4 armed . We 're doing 80 knots , and he 's pulling away , sir . I 've got him locked on . - Locked on , sir . Target is locked on . - Fire the damn missile . - Echo four , fire at will . - Fire sidewinders . Damn ! That is a negative impact . I repeat , that is a negative impact . - Negative impact , sir . - Negative impact ? That 's the goddamn Chrysler Building we 're talking about here . You told me he had it locked on . Echo 1 we had you locked on . The heat seekers can 't lock , sir . He 's colder than the buildings around . Freddie ! - What ? - Let 's go before we get caught . Jimmy , you know that bad feeling I get when something bad is going to happen ? - Yeah . - I 'm getting that feeling right now man . Descend to 300 feet . Lasers on . All systems armed . Target at 11 o 'clock . Where 'd he go ? Echo Flight , get it together , guys . Prepare to fire . Echo 4 , ready . Echo 2 , ready . Fire ! I think we got him . - We 've lost Echo 1 and 2 , sir . - God ! Echo 4 , where is target ? Jesus ! He 's right on my tail , sir ! I don 't think I can shake him . Oh , I think I lost him . We 've lost Echo 4 , sir . What the hell is the matter with you people ? You 've caused more damage than that goddamn thing did ! - Mayor . Calm down . Have some candy . - I don 't want any candy ! Leave me alone . I can 't believe it . I mean he did all of this and we did nothing to him . That 's not true . We fed him . Here at Command Center in New Jersey there is no new information to report ... because the military has clamped a total media blackout ... on whatever is going on out here . Officials are not saying anything about their attempts to contain or control this creature . Okay , now the situation is under control ! It is under control . We have containment . Don 't wait for me . I 'm okay . - Can I help you , young man ? - Yes . Do you have any at-home pregnancy tests ? Especially ones that look for gonadotrophic hormones ... or clomiphene citrate ? I don 't know . This is all we 've got . - I 'll take all of them . - Okay . Well , you must have quite some harem . Audrey , Oh , my God . Is Audrey-Is that-Is that you ? What are you doing here ? Hi . Hello . - Wow . How much is that ? - $ 46 . God , you look- - Wow ! - How have you been ? - It 's good to see you , Nick . - So you made it . - What ? You 're a reporter , huh ? No . That 's good . That 's good . That 's what you always wanted . I 'm happy for you . Really . I am . Thank you . You 're still mad at me ? Well , you left without a phone call , letter , nothing , all this time . Yeah . Yeah . I guess I am still a little mad . That was eight years ago . Some people change . Most people don 't . Well I 'm sorry you feel that way . Audrey . You 're right . Eight years is a long time . Can I make you a cup of tea ? Sure . That 'd be nice . I still can 't believe it . I mean how does a guy go from anti-nuke activist ... to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ? When you and I went to rallies together in college ... we helped to create awareness . But now , from the inside ... I 'm able to effect real change . And exactly what changes are you trying to effect ? I 'm preparing a census for the government . I 'm cataloging new species that have been created as a direct result of nuclear contamination . - Is that what you think created this thing ? - Yeah . I found a blood sample earlier this evening . - How close did you get to the thing ? - I got pretty close . - And what else did you find out ? - Well ... we know he eats tons of fish . He 's amphibious . He 's a burrower . And ... he 's pregnant . He is ? He ! A very unusual he . I mean obviously these tests weren 't designed for this ... but fundamentally they look for the same hormonal patterns to indicate pregnancy . Wait I don 't get it . It he 's the first of his kind , how can he be pregnant ? Doesn 't he need a mate ? Not if he reproduces asexually . Where 's the fun in that ? I kept thinking , why would he travel so far ? But it makes a perfect sense . Lots of animals travel great distances for reproduction . That 's what he 's doing in New York . He 's nesting . - Nesting ? - Yes . Do you realize that a lizard can lay ... up to 12 eggs at a time ? - Think of it . - I didn 't know that . Forgive me . I have to get this to the lab see if I can confirm all this . I 'll be right back . Come on , Joey . There 's nothing down here . I 'm telling you , man , I heard something . There is something . You heard nothing . It 's a dead end . Anything ? No . Nothing down here . Nothing at all . This is why , in this case , all the king 's horses and all the king 's men ... may not be able to put the Big Apple together again . Audrey Timmonds . WIDF News . - Yes ! - That 's it . You owe me a beer . You like it ? I should 've worn my hair back . - No , it looks great . - You liked it ? Good . Can I ask you something ? - Yeah what ? - How did you get a hold of this material ? Well you know , it 's like you said . " Nice guys finish last . " - Thank you . I love you . - Yeah , sure . Murray ! Murray ! Come here a second . Hold on a second ? Alright ? What is it ? I 've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked . - You do ? Whose story is that ? - Yeah . Mine . If we can lure him into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park ... I think we should be able to take him down . Last time you didn 't even scratch it . That 's not true . Our worm guy , I mean Dr. Tatopoulos here , has found blood . - Yes . Yes , I did . - So you see . The only thing ... we need to do is get him out into open terrain ... and use weapons that don 't rely on heat-seeking technology- - Excuse me , sir . I think this situation has become more complicated than that . The blood that I collected ... revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has . Are you trying to tell us that there 's another one of those things out there ? No . No , Governor . I don 't believe so . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Then how can it be pregnant ? What is this , the " virgin lizard " ? No . It reproduces asexually . That 's why we have to find the nest as soon as possible . Otherwise up to a dozen are going to be born ... each one capable of laying eggs on its own . Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population . So after we kill the creature , then we 'll search for the nest . No . I think it might be too late by then . These eggs are gonna hatch very quickly . How could you possible know that ? The fish that we found on the subway . He 's not collecting all this food just for himself . He 's preparing to feed his young . Stay tuned for our special report . Would you excuse us , please ? Where you been ? They just promo-ed your spot . It 's up right after this . Could you turn it up please ? Yo ! Can you turn it up , please ? The TV ! If Dr. Tatopoulos is right , we have to act quickly before this problem escalates . So you want to divide our efforts based solely on some wild theory ? Sir , Nick 's come through for us before and if he feels strongly ... Come through for you ? Colonel , your campaign 's a disaster . You weren 't even able to keep this thing from coming to Manhattan . Excuse me , gentlemen , but I think we should see this . Look at the methods and motivations of Manhattan 's newest unwanted pest . Godzilla . That 's what Japanese sailors called him in song . - A mythological sea dragon who filled their hearts with fear . - Oh my god . - He stole my report ! - I know . That myth has become reality , our modern-day terror . I don 't believe it ! Who is this Godzilla ? Where did he come from ? Why is he here ? And it 's Gojira , you moron ! A direct path can be traced from Manhattan to French Polynesia ... where nuclear tests have been going on for more than two decades . Research team member Dr. Nick Papadopoulus believes ... . the creature may be nesting ... using Manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species . This despite the fact that the combined might ... of the United States military has been unable to subdue- - - You went to the press with this ? - No . - No ! I haven 't talked to anyone . - They mentioned you by name ! Yeah . Yeah ! You gave them the tape ? No , I didn 't give them the tape . No . It 's in my tent right now . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! She took it . Pack your stuff , mister . You 're officially off this project as of now ! We 're leaving . I 'm so sorry about all this . Make sure that Hicks finds that nest before it 's too late . I 'll try . What do you mean he 's not there ? A second ago you told me he was on the other line . Please . It 's urgent . I really need to talk to him . Yes , Nick Tatopoulos . You 're leaving ? Why ? Is it ' cause of me ? 'Cause of the story ? What did you think was going to happen ? You never said it was off the record . I shouldn 't have to Audrey . You were supposed to be my friend . I trusted you . Nick there 's something I have to tell you . Look I lied to you . I 'm not a reporter . When we broke up , and I first came out to New York ... I was so sure I 'd make it . But I haven 't . That 's why I needed the story so bad . I just couldn 't tell you I 'm a failure . And you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes ? No . It was a terrible thing to do . I never should 've done that . Good luck with your new career . I really think you have what it takes . Newark Airport . I 'm sorry . Yo ! come on . Give her a break , will ya ? Excuse me , is this the best way to the airport ? Sir , where are you going ? Hello ? Okay , stop . Stop the car right now ! Alright . Now . Let me out of here ! I 'm afraid I can 't do that . I know you , don 't I ? Yeah , you 're that insurance guy . Agent Philippe Roaché , D.G.S.E. Direction Générale des Securité Extérieure . Sounds big . The French Secret Service . I thought you will like to know that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature 's nest . What ? Are you sure ? How do you know that ? - We know . Trust me . - Trust you ? You hijack me and you expect me to trust you ? - Yes . - Then why should I do that ? Because you are the only one who wants to find the nest as much as I do . How did you get all this stuff into the country ? This is America . We can buy anything . Why all the secrecy ? Why aren 't you guys working with the U.S. military ? I 'm not permitted to speak of such things . You said that you needed my trust . Well then I need yours . I am a patriot . I love my country . You understand that ? Sure . It is my job to protect my country . Sometimes I must even protect it from itself ... from mistakes we 've made . Mistakes that we don 't want the world to know about . - Your 're talking about the nuclear tests in the Pacific ? - Yes . These testing done by my country left a terrible mess . We 're here to clean it up . We know how to get into the city . We just don 't know where to start looking . Here . This is the 23rd Street subway station . That 's where we first found the fish . That 'd be a good place to start looking . So you 're in ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm in . I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion . - Hello . - How 's it going ? Excuse me . Pardon me . Sorry . - Honey ? - Hi , sweetie . - Who the hell are all these people ? - What ? I couldn 't just let them sleep on the street . Where 's Audrey ? In the bedroom crying her eyes out because of you . Me . What did I do ? All that " you gotta be vicious " stuff you filled her head with . - I filled ... Get out of here ! - You go in there and you talk to her right now . I was agreeing with you . Excuse me . Contrary to frivolous reporting we have absolutely no information whatsoever ... to make us believe that there are any eggs of the creature in the city . There 's no need for panic . Repeat . There 's no reason to panic . It 's all my fault . What have I done Animal ? What have I become ? Look at me . This isn 't me . I don 't do stuff like this . You made a mistake . Alright ? It happens . Yeah . Well , I just totally screwed up with the only man who will ever care about me . If I told you you could make it all up from , would you ? Of course I would . Right so get this . After he left you in the street there , I kinda followed him . Figured I 'd talk some sense into the guy , you know ? Next thing I know , he pulls into this warehouse ... with all these French wackos in military outfits . They want to try to sneak back into the city tonight . They 're going after the nest .

Aren 't there rats and stuff down here ? I 'm a little bit more concerned about lizards at this point . Big , ugly , nasty , large lizards . Who you boys with ? We 're with the 3-2 , sir .

Damn ! Fire ! Raven Flight . Evasive maneuvers . Target is in the clear . He 's headed toward the Westside Highway . Don 't worry .

Start counting . - Could you help me ? Yeah . - Yeah , you all right ? What the hell are they doing ? Nick , we have a problem . Oh , my God ! God ! Come on , let 's go . One second , all right ? One second . This is unbelievable . - Don 't you think we have enough already ? - I just want- - That 's good for me . That 's plenty . We should- - Let 's- - Let 's not startle him . We smell like the fish . - I think we should leave now . - I think that 's a good idea . Run ! Come on ! - Everybody outside now ! - Come on , quickly ! Lock the doors now ! We have to keep them contained inside . Come on , let 's go ! - You see that ? - Alright , on three . Okay . Three ! This is where the Knicks get showered and everything . Great . Now what do we do ? I 'm standing here now just outside the Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel ... where thousands of angry refugees are demanding to be let back into the city . All major arteries into the city are clogged with Manhattanites who are both jubilant that Godzilla is dead- - Yes , yes , I understand . - Your office is being swamped with phone calls . - I know . I know . Do you have any idea what 's going on out there ? The phones are ringing off the hook . Well , people are screaming to be let back into the city . We 're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body . That thing 's dead . What are you waiting for ? Colonel . Colonel , we 've got to start a search for the nest . Elsie , we 've been through this already . What if Nick is right and we blow this whole thing ? This could be the only chance we have to do something about it . Captain , organize a search party . I want a complete sweep of the entire city and the subway . You don 't have the authority to do that . Try and stop me . Contact the military . And get them to send a bomber to blow up this building . - How do I do that ? - 555-7600 . Tell them it 's a Code Dragonfly . That should get you through . What are you waiting for ? - 555 what ? - 7600 . - All circuits are busy right now . - It 's busy . Try again ! What did they say ? I can 't get through . I don 't know what 's wrong . We secured the doors on the upper levels . - Where is Jean-Philippe and Jean-Pierre ? - They didn 't make it . Nick my men and I will hold them here . You 'll have to go and get help . You think we can fit up in there ? Only one way to find out , alright ? Boost me up . This is not good . Come on . Come on . Wrong floor . Why don 't we go this way ? - It 's me . It 's me . - What happened ? They 're loose . They 're all over the place . I couldn 't get out . - Who the hell are you ? - Audrey ! Here . - You all right ? - I think so . No cameras . Yeah , all right . Very good . Do you have a radio , walkie-talkie , anything we can use to contact the outside ? - What about the phones ? - No . It 's no good . Circuits are jammed . Wait . I know a way . I know how we can get a message to the outside . This way . Come on . The tape ! Come on ! Come on . - Come on , the broadcast booth is right over here . - How do you know that ? Our network covers the Rangers games . - It 's locked . - Wait . There 's a code . There 's a code . Come on ! Come on ! I was just about to get it . The network is on an intranet . It 's a direct feed into our computer system . Your station isn 't gonna have any easier time reaching the military than I did . When you worked with them , did they monitor all the news broadcasts ? Yeah . Yeah , they did . All right , we 'll go live . Audrey , we 'll broadcast right from in here . Hopefully they 'll see it . I 'll try to get a message through . Let 's not forget in our rush to return to the city ... that many people have had their lives changed forever . No one in the city has been untouched by the tragedy . The sick , the displaced , the injured- - There 's no Ranger game on tonight . Ed , if you 're seeing this , will you please put us on live ? It 's urgent . I know this sounds crazy , but you have to do it . Please just trust me . I 'm not putting you on live . - I don 't think he 'll do it . - Yes , he will . All right , Ed ? Come on ! You see that ? They 'll be all over the city if we don 't stop them . Give me a second . Will you ? Finally the time has come to return to our homes and pick up our lives . - These are the last three . - Our fears have been allayed . Thanks to the heroic efforts of our boys in uniform- - Are we on ? This calculator- - Yeah good , you 're on . Yes . Yes , you 're on . Go ! We 're live inside Madison Square Garden ... where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has discovered the beast 's lair . Doctor , can you please tell us what 's happening here ? - That 's you , yes . Go , go . - Thank you . Yeah . Well , we 've discovered over 200 eggs . Go get Hicks . Get Hicks Which a few moments ago began hatching . The creatures now just hatched are over nine feet tall , and they 've begun feeding . When their food supply runs out here ... they will attempt to hunt down food of their own outside of this nest . Oh , my God ! If they get out , they 'll multiply and very soon a new species will emerge . One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet . Each one of these amazing reptiles ... are born pregnant . Adaptive and cunning , these 200 could become 40,000 within this year . If the military is listening to this broadcast ... they have to destroy this building immediately ... before these creatures can escape . So far they 're all trapped inside this building ... but I don 't think we can contain them for long . They 're very strong and agile ... and they 're looking for food . So I guess your theory of the creature nesting turned out to be correct after all . Regardless of what happens to us , the most important thing ... is that this building be destroyed immediately before they can escape out into the city . Reporting live from Madison Square Garden ... this is Audrey Timmonds for WIDF News . Thanks , Audrey . Sure . That 's affirmative . Let me spell it out for you . I want you to blow up Madison Square Garden . Well , the good news is they got that message . The bad news is we 've got less than six minutes to get out of the building . Okay . Party 's over . Time to leave . Anyone care to join me ? - Where did you find this guy ? - He 's from France . Stallion 1-5s I.P. inbound . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Guys ... Guys , this way . Come on .

Two , three . I think I lost them . Stallion 1-5 showing a good laser track on top of the Garden . Selecting L.G.B. How much time do we have left ? - Less than 30 seconds . - Oh God . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Save your Mavericks . Two away . Lead has good hits . Are you all right ? Yeah . Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting . You 'd be surprised . I 'd like to find out . How ya doin ' ? You all right ? I could use a coffee . He looks angry . What do we do ? Running would be a good idea . Let 's go ! Come on ! - Get in ! - What are you doin ' ? You better step on it , Mr. French . Take 57th street across town and cut up the westside . No . Are you crazy ? Take the FDR . - The FDR in the rain ? - Got to be a map . He 's gettin ' larger ! Take the Westside Highway ! - I got one . - The Westside 's got construction . This is a subway map ! - Broadway ? - Make up your minds ! Take Broadway ! We 're traveling down Broadway . And make a right on 34th Street . That was O 'Neal . Is everybody okay ?

He 's headed toward the Brooklyn Bridge . - Target is heading toward the Brooklyn Bridge , sir . Direct the F-18s to the Brooklyn Bridge . - He 's not following us ! - Really ? Well , you gotta be kiddin ' me man . We 're in his mouth . We 're in his mouth . You 're goin ' the wrong way , man ! You 're goin ' the wrong way . Will you shut up man ? Okay . Gun it ! Gun it !

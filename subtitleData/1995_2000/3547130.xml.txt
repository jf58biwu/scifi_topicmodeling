 Oh , Anna . * * Slow down , Mr. Lansing . You got somewhere to be ? Have a seat . Very nice . Let 's take our time . ( music grows distorted ) ( screams ) ( phone ringing ) Look , you don 't have to protect me , Lieutenant . I hope you 're right , Anna . ( cell phone rings ) Anna ? ( sobbing ) : You got to help me ! Where are you ? I don 't know . I 'm outside . It looks like the Tierra Bay Hotel . Oh , my God ! ( sobbing ) : Help me , please ! Something terrible 's happened . I want you to stay right there . I 'm coming to you . Stay there . ( tires squeal ) * * Anna ! Anna ! ( sniffling ) Stay right there . Horatio ... Anna , are you hurt ? I don 't know . Anna , listen to me . Is that your blood ? No , I don 't think so . Tell me what happened . I-I-I didn 't do it . You gotta believe me ! I didn 't do anything wrong ! I believe you , but tell me what happened . God , I can 't . I can 't remember . Empty your pockets . What 's in your pockets ? What do you got ? Let me see . ( siren wailing ) Miami-Dade Police . TRIP : So you 're telling me she says he fell on the ground , she got all woozy , woke up 20 minutes later covered in blood ? CAINE : Anna couldn 't have done this , Frank . I hope you 're right , Horatio . I really do . She 's covered in blood , and right now she 's our # 1 suspect . I can 't release her . I understand . Nothing personal . It is now . Capture : FRM @ xxy Sync : FRM @ 8754 Anna , what 's the last thing you can remember ? Dinner . I-I remember dinner . Who did you have dinner with ? Doug . Yeah , he owns a big company , like cable TV or something . Okay . Did you meet him at the hotel ? Yeah . It was a date . We were in one of those cabana suites . I think he ordered us room service . * * All right . What else ? I can 't remember the rest . Okay . Sorry . Then I went outside , and that 's when I called you . Okay , um , I 'm gonna have this gentleman take a look at you . A good look . It 's okay , Anna , you 're gonna be all right . ( indistinct radio transmission ) ( indistinct radio transmission ) ( camera shutter snapping ) WOODS : Definite stab wound . Punctured his abdomen . So who 's our lucky recipient ? Tripp ID 'd him , and it 's Doug Lansing . Should I know who that is ? president of the Holfcroff Communications Syndicate . They basically own and run every media outlet in Miami . Shame you can 't take all that capital with ya , honey . So , uh , what do you think happened to the top of his head ? Well , looks like Mr. Lansing 's scalp is retracted . Retracted ? Mm-hmm . His scalp is retraed ? Yep . Someone scalped this guy ? Oh , yeah . What , are we in the Wild West ? Lozado Street Gang is responsible for the resurgence . Put a couple guys on my table last year , scalps sheared off . Where 'd the rest of his head go ? Well , I hear they like to keep ' em as trophies . It 's an awful way to go . ( screams ) This room service tray could , um , put someone else in the suite . ( camera shutter clicking ) Whoa . What 'd you find ? The rest of his head . Hey . Yeah ? CSI Wolfe , mitts off , honey . Body parts are mine . Stick to the physical evidence . You got it , Doctor . ( indistinct radio transmission ) BOA VISTA : I got here as soon as I heard it was Anna . I 'm gonna collect her clothes . Okay . That blood is a passive transfer . She might have wiped her hands . But if it 's equivocal , we side with the suspect , don 't we ? Right , I know , but I won 't know if it 's equivocal until I process it . Do it . * * ( camera shutter clicks ) * * I 'm gonna need your clothes , one article at a time . ( mouthing ) * * Break room is down the hall on the right . ( chuckles ) That 's cute . But this is room service left over from the cabana suite . Ryan brought it in . You testing it for the presence of drugs ? Yeah , I ran it through mass spec . It 's a benzodiazepine derivative . Yeah , Schedule II . Most hospitals use it as anesthesia . Could it be used for anything else ? Yeah , it can be used to treat epilepsy . It affects as a short-term hypnotic ; fast-acting , loss of memory , loss of consciousness . That 's exactly what Anna described . Well , both of these sandwiches show trace amounts . This should get her off the hook for Doug Lansing 's murder . Let 's go pay a visit to room service . * * Mr. Stark . Yeah . I 'm Calleigh Duquesne . This is Eric Delko . We 're with Miami-Dade Police Department . I understand you served dinner last night to cabana suite four , is that correct ? Probably . Why ? Someone was murdered in that suite . It started when their food was dosed . Well , I 'm not the only one with access to food around here . There 's a whole kitchen staff . Yeah , we know . We 're starting with you . I didn 't dose anybody . Look , I 'm in the middle of a double shift . If I could help you , I would , but ... I just deliver the food . Well , if that 's true , we 'll just need to get some elimination samples from you- - fingerprints , DNA . Whatever . I just need to get back to work . So , a little piece of advice : skip the turkey club at the Tierra Bay Hotel . Yeah , right ? I heard Anna and the vic were both drugged . And then someone comes in and scalps the guy . Yeah , I saw the scalp , and the tox reports on both of them confirmed that there was the presence of benzos . Well , Anna 's clothes says that she was laying down next to the vic as he bled . Take a look . Yeah , that 's the dried delineation of blood . The blood pooled around her as she was laying down , left that line on her pants . ( yells ) ( gentle splashing ) What about the victim 's clothes ? Is there anything in there that 's gonna tell us who murdered him ? I 'm going to start going through it right now . Okay , I 'll help you log . Thank you . We 've got ... keys ... to a Mercedes ... Yeah . Change ... Lip balm ... And a pin with a county seal . It 's engraved . Whoever it belonged to was from District 30 . " S.O. " Isn 't the county supervisor over there O 'Shay ? Scott O 'Shay . Stay away from Anna Sivarro . You really want to throw it all away over a girl like that ? Horatio 's best friend . Really ? No , not really . ( dials cell phone ) Horatio . Yeah , I think I got something . Is there something I can do for you , Lieutenant ? Matter of fact , there is , Supervisor . We found your campaign pin on a dead man . Hmph . It 's not exactly mine . I give them away to campaign contributors . There are hundreds of them . Who knows who that belongs to . I believe this contributor 's name was Doug Lansing . Yeah , I heard about his death this morning . It 's a terrible loss . Doug was a friend . Yes , I 'm sure he was . Did you see Doug this morning ? Your answer 's no . You obviously missed my speech on the morning news . You talk to your hooker friend Anna ? Yes , I have , and she 's been cleared . I 'm sure she has . You saw to that , didn 't you ? Be careful , Caine . You don 't really know who she is . And you do ? I 've done some digging . She try to tell you she 's from Galveston ? A man has been killed . This is not about Anna . You 're not careful , she could wind up making you look bad . Just some advice . Yes , and you are not in a position to give advice , Supervisor . ? Hmph . Yeah , we moved on to the mini-bar . Went over Doug Lansing 's bill for the cabana suite , and he was charged for every one of these items , even though they were unopened and in the mini-bar when we processed the room . Well , you know , if you pull something out , you 're charged automatically . Yeah , but the weird thing is that all of these charges came at virtually the same time . That 's strange . Why would Lansing pull everything out of the mini-bar at once ? Someone was looking to lock something in its place because the room safe was too small . Hmm . What are you thinking ? I 'm thinking whatever it was was swapped out before Ryan processed the suite . Can you think of anyone who would 've put all this back in the mini-bar before Ryan got to the room ? Ah , most of the prints lead back to Lansing . But not all ? I found a partial . It wasn 't Jesse Stark 's , the room service guy . Ran it through AFIS , I got nothing back . I 'm now searching the Hotel Workers ' Union . Ross Miller . He 's a bellman . Yeah , the Tierra Bay Hotel . It 's never the bellman 's job to restock the mini-bar , is it ? No . No , it 's definitely not in his job description . Ross Miller . Yeah ? I 'm CSI Duquesne . CSI Delko . We just want to ask you a few questions . All right , fire away . They involve cabana suite four . Where the body was found today . Mm-hmm . Well ... I was probably there , along with all the other suites in that wing . Is it customary to help yourself to the mini-bar in those suites ? What kind of question is that ? What , are you guys the food police ? Do yourself a favor , Ross . We found your fingerprints on the mini-bar contents . What were you looking for ? Why don 't you open up the trunk , Ross ? Come on . ( keyless entry beeps ) Ho . Couple hundred grand here . ( sighs ) : All right . Mr. Lansing 's girl left her keys in the lobby . Just don 't forget to tell him , Anna , he 'll see the rest next week . Then I saw the money . What are you doing here ? Uh , the woman forgot her car keys . Thank you . It was open . Go . So you drugged the room service tray , then went back and killed Mr. Lansing for the money . Scalped him with a knife . No . No , they were sleeping when I got there , and they were sleeping when I left . Wha ... ? Come on , they weren 't dead , they were alive . You 're under arrest . Theft , false imprisonment . Ryan ? Yeah ? Have you seen Horatio ? No , I haven 't . Why , what 's up ? Think I found a connection between our dead guy and O 'Shay . Is that right ? State lets the American Indian put casinos on the reservations . Right , as reparations for stealing the land out from under them . Since then , the Kipayo Casinos have made them all millionaires . And the revenues divided up amongst the tribe members , isn 't it ? Uh-huh . O 'Shay 's getting a piece of the action . You 're kidding me . How 'd he manage that ? Pushed the casino bill forward . And he arranged for our victim , Doug Lansing , to get on the Indian Legislative Board . Lansing is pulling the legal strings and O 'Shay 's getting the kickbacks . Yeah , that couple hundred thou we snatched from the bellboy ? Yeah ... Tip of the iceberg . I 'll tell H. I was moving money for O 'Shay . But I wasn 't getting any of it . I was just taking it from one place to another . And how long did this go on ? Two years . Why ? What does he have on you ? I can 't . I can 't say ... You mean you won 't say . So what , you 're giving up on me now ? No . I 'm driving you home . Come on . ANNA : Thank you , Horatio . Anna . Oh , my God ! Someone 's broken in . Step back . Oh , no ! What are you doing ? Anna ... is something missing ? My book . What book ? It had names and phone numbers and clients . Not my clients , Tess 's . Why do you have it ? It was left to me when she died . Horatio , everybody 's in it . We 'd better find that book . HELICOPTER PILOT : Attention all South Beach units . 253-F to a residential burglary . Suspect last seen in the area of 14th and Collins . ( siren blares ) Miami-Dade PD . Whoa . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Get your hands up . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . What are you doing ? I 'm just getting some footage of your investigation , that 's all . Well , if you 're looking to up your ratings , you 've come to the wrong place . We 're just investigating a burglary . Oh , I know . How 's that ? Because I saw the guy ripping this place off about 90 minutes ago . He broke in through the front door . I shot the whole thing . Really ? You just happened to be here ? Well , you make your own luck . I was down the street , I got wind of a domestic disturbance over the police scanner , but , uh , this was better . You 're a stringer . Yeah , I videotape crime scenes and accidents . Nope . You can 't live without us , they pay top dollar for my stuff . Did you see who broke into this apartment ? Already got two stations interested . You guys , uh , you want in on the bidding ? Aw , come on , now . You know Miami-Dade doesn 't bid for evidence . Wow . That 's ... that 's too bad . I 'll just put you under a microscope . Unlawful business practice , trespassing , harassment . Right . Here 's the tape . Thank you kindly . Hey , Leo . What are you doing here ? Filling in . Cooper has a Graphical User Interface seminar . Oh . I must have missed that one . You here about the video Calleigh brought in ? Yeah . So is this stringer guy going to be able to help us ? Well , he 's definitely got footage from the break-in . This is your bad guy coming out . WOLFE : And there 's Anna Sivarro 's place . There 's the book . Could we get a better look at his face ? No . Our cameraman was hiding . He had a lousy vantage point . I can 't help but feel like Cooper would find a way , but ... Hmm . Working the new guy . Yeah . That 's right . Okay , okay . Are you sharpening the image ? Uh , no . Rebuilding it . See , our image is blurry , so I 'm replacing each bad pixel with a clear one from a neighboring frame . There 's his face . That 's great . Now , is this enough for us to use to compare in the photo database ? I think so . Louis Sullivan . Looks like breaking and entering is a hobby . Yeah , I 'm going to have Homicide pick him up . And Leo , not bad . You got to be kidding me . Somebody videotaped me ? You 're lucky you didn 't make it onto the news . So let me ask you something . What kind of thief breaks into an apartment but passes on the cash and passes on the credit cards ? A thief that is looking for a black book . Right , Louis ? * * Who paid you to steal it ? Nobody ... yet . The dude who hired me wanted proof that I had it . So I photocopied a couple of pages and sent them over to him . He said we 'd be in touch . Who wanted the book ? I think it 's time for my free lawyer . 'Cause if I start opening my mouth , things are going to get a whole lot worse for me . ? et ] [ Tess Gowan 's infamous black book . Reads like a who 's who of Miami . Athletes , business leaders , judges ... Imagine the lives ruined if this made the press , Eric . No doubt . Got our victim- - Doug Lansing . And Supervisor Scott O 'Shay . Who is this guy Reggie Veston ? Well , the handwriting below the name and number is inconsistent with the other entries . Probably because Anna made that entry , and Tess didn 't . This one , too . Karl Bennett . It 's a 404 area code . That 's Atlanta . That 's a long way to travel . It certainly is . There must be a reason . Excuse me . ( phone dialing ) MAN : Hello . Karl Bennett , please . Yes . Who is this ? Yes , Karl . This is Horatio Caine , from the Miami Crime Lab . I 'm calling about Anna Sivarro . Is she dead ? Uh , no , she 's not , Karl . What is the nature of your relationship ? She knows not to contact me . Nobody she knows is ever to call me . It 's a direct violation of our agreement . Your agreement ? Would you mind describing that ? A court order for custody . Um ... custody ? As in child custody . Yes , it is . Anything else ? Uh ... No , Karl . That 's all I need . Thank you . Hi , Alexx . Hi . So , we get a COD on Doug Lansing ? Exsanguination . Severed pulmonary artery . But that 's not why I called you over . It 's the victim 's scalp . Take a look at the soft tissue on the leading edge . Is that a shard of his skull ? Mm-mm . No bone was fragmented . So this came from whatever scalped him . Say hello to your murder weapon . I heard that Alexx found a piece of the murder weapon in the victim 's scalp . She did , and it 's definitely skeletal . Animal ? Yeah . It 's calcified . It 's brittle . It 's got a protein base . So it 's not mineral . That rules out ivory . The outer surface is rough , inner cavity spongy yet vascular . Bet it could be a deer antler . Deer antler , huh ? What are you basing that on ? My dad used to hunt . This is old and discolored . It 's like it 's an artifact . Well , that 's not something the general public 's walking around with , is it ? You know , I think it 's time we visit the Kipayo Indian casino . O 'Shay did get Lansing on the Indian Legislative Board . You know , this place is actually , uh ... it 's kind of hip . There 's a lot of money that flows in and out of here . I would expect nothing less . I think the office is this way . Mr. and Mrs. Veston ? Hi . We 're from the Miami-Dade Crime Lab . We 're surprised to find CSI out here on our land . We 're investigating a murder that occurred early this morning . Specifically with an antique knife . Someone kills with an antique knife , and you immediately come to us ? Do you go to the Russians if it 's an AK-47 ? This is not a racial issue , Mrs. Veston . The person who was murdered had financial ties to your casino . Doug Lansing . Doug was one of our first non-Indian investors . He was a board member . More like a financial godfather . Someone we learned to hate . That 's a pretty strong word . Lansing and his partners changed the meaning of our tribal agreements . Regulating your people right out of their own money . And Lansing walked away with the rest of it . He and O 'Shay . Scott O 'Shay won 't show his face around here . He knows better . This money was earmarked for schools and healthcare . If it wasn 't for Reggie , none of this revenue would flow back to the people . So every person on this reservation has motive to kill Lansing . Looks that way . I just spoke to Karl Bennett , Anna . So you know . I know about your son . Why don 't you tell me about him ? He 's almost three . It just happened . I wanted to keep him . For a while , I was doing pretty good , but ... Anna , if you don 't tell me everything , I can 't help you . His father has some money , but I want to give my son everything he needs . And O 'Shay offered to help . Help how ? He makes sure money goes to my son every month . Okay , explain that to me . How does it work ? Passing casino payoffs . I do it for my son . Okay . What 's next ? O 'Shay had his sights on Reggie Veston . He was always asking me for that black book . Which explains why he had it stolen from you . He 's blackmailing Veston . And now that I have the information , he 's going to go direct to Veston . ( siren wailing ) Miami-Dade PD ! Reggie ! Reggie ! Clear . Clear . It 's too late . ? You 're not leaving any stone unturned , are you , Lieutenant ? You 're making my associates very uncomfortable . Yes , with Doug Lansing out of the way you 're going to need a new front man for your casino investments . Casinos ? Now that would be unethical for a man in my position . Which is why you were blackmailing Reggie Veston . That 's a hefty accusation . I got another news flash for you . We found him dead at the Kipayo Casino Hotel . You 're kidding ? No , and by the looks of him , he wasn 't easily persuadable , was he ? I wasn 't persuading anyone . I know you had Tess ' black book stolen . Can you really prove it was me ? Anna can . You won 't have her in court . She won 't testify . Is that because you 're supporting her child ? You can 't pull me in here for every crime in Miami . Not every crime- - just the ones you 're guilty of . Guilty ? Where are your prints , DNA ? Your lab runs on money . Everyone on your team has a salary . Harassment is not without consequences . My team thrives on consequences . Everyone has a price . Yeah , even you . ( camera shutter snaps ) DUQUESNE : Reggie Veston- - well-liked , well-respected . He ends up dead in a bungalow . DELKO : Yeah , well , everybody 's got a secret . His finally got out . H says that O 'Shay was blackmailing him for kickbacks from the casino . Do you think that 's who killed him ? Whoever it was , they were pissed off . ( groaning ) You stab somebody in the face- - that 's personal . He was the leader of a tight - knit community , a wealthy one ... I don 't know that personal is going to narrow the field . What have you got ? Some sort of a paper product . Maybe our victim carried it in . Maybe they did . * * So you 're running the trace from Reggie Veston 's hotel room through FTIR ? I am , and the GCMS . You 've got high hopes for a little piece of paper . It 's not just paper , it 's more than that . It 's confetti . And how is that better ? Because it 's the kind they throw at the casino . ( cheering ) Calleigh , 50,000 people stomp through there every day . True , but the mass spec found eight percent ethanol on the confetti . It could be hair spray . How does that I.D. a suspect ? FTIR results . The suspect uses a hair spray that has a raspberry leaf extract ? More than likely female . Anna Sivarro 's the only woman involved in this case . Yeah , but she was at P.D. when Reggie Veston was murdered , so it rules her out . Who else would want him dead ? Maybe someone with new information . Is that what this is about ? It 's confetti . You left it behind with your husband . Is my name on it or something ? Sort of . It 's the same confetti that 's used at your casino . ( cheering ) It allowed us to obtain a search warrant for your place . This hair spray from your bathroom- - it contains raspberry leaf extract . Where are we going with all of this ? This hair spray was found on this confetti . Long odds . You had opportunity . You had means . I know you were there . Somebody sent me a copy of a black book this morning , and my husband 's name was in it . Reggie was having sex with a prostitute . I promise you , it was just that one time . O 'Shay sent her to me . Her name was Tess . You 've got to be kidding me . Okay ... Why are you telling me now ? Because I think they 're going to use it against me . O 'Shay is trying to set me up . He called me an hour ago . Asked to be cut into the casino . And I refused . So you weren 't going to tell me about her until now ? I couldn 't , Adrienne . Why ? Because you 're afraid of hurting me ? Or our people ? No , it was always you . I don 't believe you ! How could you be so stupid ? ! ( groans ) You 're under arrest . * * Hey . Heard you got some info on the Doug Lansing murder . Yeah , I had all the case reference samples tested for their ancestry and formative markers . Any member of the tribe could be a suspect . Well , here 's the results . One of our suspects tested positive for haplogroup B. Allele groupings consistent with Native American populations . A " B " haplotype is the minimum finding to be entitled to casino earnings . Jesse Stark , huh ? He is , uh ... the kid from room service . You know , I wouldn 't peg him as being Native American . Turns out he 's 1 / 16 Kipayo , and that earns him Native American status . Yeah , but is it enough to collect a piece of the casino revenue ? STARK : I 've never seen it before . Really ? That 's interesting . We found it wrapped in a T-shirt in your garage . And there 's a chip of it thatas found in the scalp of our victim . So ? You never said you were 1 / 16 Kipayo . You filed for a certificate of authenticity of Indian blood with the Bureau of Indian Affairs in D.C. three years ago . You provided supporting documents . And you , uh ... you provided ancestral artifacts . This is your knife . See , the government lets us own a casino . Then white fat cats like Doug Lansing swoop in . I knew about Lansing from the papers . Saw him around the hotel . I could hear him hiring attorneys- - deciding who gets rich , who gets tossed aside . Yeah . I 'm tired of these Indians . Well , then get them disqualified . I don 't care if they 're full-blooded . Tell them to get a job . The money 's ours . My people have generated a half billion in revenue . And you think you deserve part of that ? Hell , yeah . Then I see him drugged out of his mind with this girl . Room service . And there he was , laying there . Doug Lansing- - he bought his way into tribal affairs . He changed the rules . He cut you out of your racial inheritance . ( screaming ) * * * * I didn 't tell you a lot of things . You were protecting your son , Anna . Like any good mother . And Scott O 'Shay- - what happens ... ? I want you to stay away from him . You understand ? Stay away from him . I got to figure things out . The child 's important ... I don 't want you to worry about that either , okay ? Is this where I get my life back ? It is , but this time , you can 't let it get away . Agreed ? Okay ?

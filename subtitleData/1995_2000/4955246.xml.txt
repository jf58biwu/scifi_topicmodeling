 You think he saw us ? I don 't think so . I do . Even if they didn 't , they have infrared scanners . Yeah , well , I don 't think anyone saw us . We slide out of here in 45 minutes . If we lie low , we should be all right till then . That 's a long time to play hide and seek with a Kromagg . Hustle it up , Remmy . Come on , move it . What do you think that place was ? Well , it 's gotta be military . The Maggs don 't go in for leisure sport . Could be a burned-out storage depot . Yeah , well , I didn 't see any other structures . Well , it could be a proving ground for weapons . Or it could be a camp where they train the Maggs to hunt humans . Kind of like that pleasant resort we stumbled across a couple of worlds back . I don 't think anyone saw us . Maybe we 're overreacting . It is humanly impossible to overreact to the Kromaggs . All right , this place looks pretty good . Maggie and I 'll take lookout . You guys lay low . We 're out of here in 40 minutes . The girl 's in Sector 5 Red . For a breeder to escape . And with an infant , yet . Commander , I assure you there 's no way this breeder will get away . My men will pick her up any minute now . We 're picking up other indicators in the same sector . What could that be ? I had that sector patrolled less than an hour ago . You , go take a unit and find out what 's going on there . Maggie , someone 's coming . Kromaggs ? No . Looks more like a woman . She 's alone . Don 't be afraid , don 't be afraid . We 're friends . Don 't touch him . It 's okay . It 's okay . Mommy 's right here . Go back to sleep . Who are you ? Where 'd you come from ? I 'm Quinn Mallory , and where we came from is kind of a long story . Quinn Mallory ? Yeah , that 's right . Then you 're Maggie . How do you know who we are ? I 'm Christina Griffin . Wade told me all about you guys . Wade ? Yeah , your friend Wade . Wade Wells . So you know Wade ? Where is she ? I don 't know . We gotta get moving . They gotta know by now we 've escaped . Escaped from what ? A Kromagg breeder camp . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Where were you going to go ? I don 't know . I just had to get out of there . Once I was outside , I hoped to find someplace . But you 're here now . It 's just like Wade said . You 'd find a way to get to us . Can I go with you guys when you ... What is that ? Slide . Of course you can . Guys , this is Christina . She just escaped from the Kromagg breeder camp , somewhere down there . This is my brother Colin , and this is Rem ... I know . It 's Rembrandt . She knew Wade . Knew ? I mean , is she alive ? Is she there ? Yeah , she 's alive . As far as I know . Hey , if Wade is back there , we gotta do something . I don 't know if we have enough time . Look , I don 't care , man . We gotta get back there ! It 's too late . She 's gone . The Magg shipped all the other prisoners out yesterday to make way for the new arrivals . Wade was with them . I managed to get away in all the confusion . For what it 's worth , Wade doesn 't think that you deserted her . And she doesn 't blame you at all for what happened to her . I 'm picking up a slight reading on that hill . Several indicators . Several indicators ? Who is out there besides your runaway ? All right , we 're gonna go take lookout . Well , it looks like a perfectly normal baby to me . Yeah , well , they do for the first year . I don 't know a lot about it . It 's some kind of genetic quirk . The gestation and birth are normal . The Kromagg genes are repressed . It 'll grow up ugly , trust me . Wouldn 't you know it . We land in a world crawling with Kromaggs , no guns , and now we got a baby . And I was thinking about getting a dog . You hear something ? It 's coming from over there . All right , guys , stay hidden . We 're gonna go check out what this is . Oh , there we go . We 're keeping steady , you and me . We 're in this together . It 's okay . He seems to be in pretty good shape . Yeah , he 's a fighter . How old is he ? Almost eight months . We made our break just in time . Humagg babies are taken away from their mothers at nine months . Then at a really young age , they start their training to be soldiers . We 've run into a few of them along the way . Well , you seem to have survived it . It wasn 't easy . Hello . You know , at first , I couldn 't stand to look at him . Half of him came from something I hated so much . But he 's so beautiful , and he 's smart . Yeah . After all , what happened to me wasn 't his fault . We 're gonna get out of this , little guy . You just wait and see . What 's his name ? Well , you 're going to think this is really strange , but he doesn 't have one . I haven 't been able to think of the right one . Surviving from day to day in that place , I had to think of nothing else . You 've got plenty of time . The right one will come to you . You can always name him Maggie . Yeah . Okay , let 's go , huh ? Two Maggs in a Humvee . I knew it . Infrared scanners . This is the part where you usually come up with a great idea . Wait , me ? Why do I always have to come up with a good idea ? Hey , guys , wait . They 're looking for a woman , right ? Maybe we should give them one . All right , Magg . Well , that should buy us some time . I don 't know . There 's gotta be more goons out there like these . How long till the slide ? Eighteen minutes . Where will we go ? We don 't know . I 'll take point . There 's a little glitch in our gizmo . Could we go to my home world ? If we knew your home coordinates . They 'd be in the Kromagg Central Data Bank . Okay , uh , you 've got a choice now . You can either work with us or die . Question too difficult for you , Magg ? I 'll help . Smart choice . Can you work it ? If I can get into the system . I 'm sure there 's a password . Here , come here . Log us on . Unit Four , report . Unit Four , what 's happening out there ? All right , uh , tell him you 're enjoying the weather and having a fine day . Unit Four . What 's going on ? Uh , sorry , sir . False alarm . No sign of the prisoner . You said you had a pattern . Several indicators , you said . It must have been wildlife . No sign of a human out here . Resume the search pattern , and keep me posted . Base out . You do very good work . Now open up your system and bring up the prisoners ' files . No tricks . I read your language . Go on , Maggot . What are we looking for ? Bring up anything on prisoners Christina Griffin and Wade Wells . I 'll need their prisoner serials . Their what ? ID numbers . We don 't keep their human names on file . I don 't know Wade 's , but mine 's JK1125 . Now cross-reference that with her home world . What is it ? That 's interesting . So , when do you think that happened ? The file states that our battalions withdrew six months ago . Withdrew ? Yeah , yeah , that 's what it says . My parents , they could be alive . All right , let me get those coordinates . Units Two and Three , widen your search area . Unit Six , return to the river . If she went that way , she may have gotten across . All right , got it . Now for Wade . But without her ID number ... All right , we 'll do it the hard way . Pull up the records as fast as you can . When we see her picture , we 'll tell you to stop . What 's going on ? Unit Four is accessing prisoner files . Why ? Unit Four , this is base ! What are you doing ? Those files are protected ! All right , what do we do ? We keep running through these files . We only got eight minutes left . The only conclusion I can draw , Subcommander , is that a woman and a baby have overpowered two of your best men , and are now casually scanning our protected data . We had several different IR readings . Somebody 's out there . Somebody 's helping her ! What 's the matter ? " Network error 807 . Please notify system administrator . " Try it again . All units , Unit Four has been disabled . Coordinates 9774 by 39 . All units converge . I hope you 're not outgunned out there , Sub-Commander . I don 't like this . They could be tracking us now . I mean , sending in other units . Right . All right , Colin , Maggie ! We 're getting out of here . Thanks for all your help . See you ! You read Kromagg ? He bought it . Back up , back up ! Hang on . Shouldn 't we get out to hit the vortex ? We 're just gonna have to take the chance that the vortex can handle all the mass . I 'll count it off . Ten seconds . Get ready . Anybody hurt ? We 're all right . Look , we don 't know who 's here yet or what their intentions might be . All right , so leave the rifle in the car . We got nine hours . This the right place ? This look like your world ? Yeah . I think so . Christina , I think you better keep the baby well-covered . Are you certain it was a trans-dimensional vortex ? Yes , sir . A court martial will be convened to review this case . All amenities will be observed . You 'll have representation , a fair , unbiased hearing , then full military execution . It 'll be very nice . Four humans . Three male , one female . They took the weapons off Unit Four , accessed the computer , and then with their primitive sliding device escaped to another dimension . We received a Dynasty Directive about these humans earlier this year . We were ordered not to detain them , but now things have changed . They are now considered to be extremely dangerous , and are to be taken down by whatever means necessary . Something your troops are obviously not up to . It is clear that they transported themselves back to the escapee 's home world . With your permission , I 'll take a commando unit to that world , recapture the breeder , and deal with the sliders , per Dynasty Directive . Permission denied . No Kromagg is permitted to return to that world under pain of death . I know that , sir , but , under the circumstances , I thought we might find a solution to the bigger problem , as well . I don 't have the authority to override a Dynasty Directive . You 're not to pursue anyone to that world . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Bye . Last time I saw this street , we were running . Hundreds of us , from the Kromagg invasion force . Their ships fired on us . My two brothers died right here . Even those of us who fought back were overpowered . But the people in your world won in the end . Drove the Maggs away . Folks don 't seem to be too friendly , though . Kromaggs make enemies faster than anybody . Yeah , but we 're not Kromaggs . But we are strangers , and they 're not going to take any chances . We 're not here that long . I 'm just glad we were able to get Christina and her baby off that world . It 's funny they didn 't pursue us . I mean , they know the coordinates . Yeah , well , stay sharp . The show 's not over till the fat Magg croaks . Something here must really scare them . Something to scare a Kromagg . Now , that I 'd like to see . So many nights I 'd have dreams , walking up to it just like this . Then I 'd wake up in the barracks . I never thought I 'd see it again . Let me hold him ? You don 't want to give them two surprises at once , right ? Hello . Yes ! Dad ? Christina ? Oh , my God ! God , I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it . How ... How did you ? Where 's Mom ? Your Mom 's gone . Caught in the war . No . I thought they 'd taken you all away from me forever . Her heart would be so full at this moment . Where have you been ? Where have you been all this time ? I was a prisoner . A Kromagg camp on another world . Come here . These are the wonderful people that helped me escape . Quinn , Colin , Rembrandt , Maggie , this is Jonathan Griffin . This is my dad . I don 't understand . You said you were on another world ? How did you get here ? These people are sliders , Dad . No , only Kromaggs can do that . We can , too . I invented this device that was supposed to be a , uh , anti-gravity machine , but it turned out to be something else . We 've traveled from world to world for quite some time now . We fought the Kromaggs on many worlds . Dad , these people are friends , I promise you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you for my daughter . And who 's this little one there ? Come on , baby . We 're home now . Christina . The camp . It was a breeder camp ? Those who put up too much of a fight or who couldn 't conceive were taken away . Killed , I suppose . You 're saying there was nothing you could do ? Mr. Griffin , I can tell you from personal experience , there 's no use in trying to fight them once you 've been taken to a camp . There 's no way to resist them . Your daughter did what she had to do to survive . I suppose I have to accept that you were forced to do this . But you were not forced to keep it , to bring it here . When you were able to escape , why didn 't you do it alone ? Because he 's my child . Can you send it back ? I don 't know the coordinates . And even if we could , we would never do that . Believe me , it would have been best . For both of you . That could have gone better . He wasn 't really primed for this . Look on the bright side . At least he didn 't throw us out . Not yet . Maybe we should go . Where would you go ? There was a great poet on my world that once said , " Home is a place where , when you have to go there , " they have to take you in . " Remember what you said to me ? You said this little guy is a fighter . Well , his mommy is , too . So don 't you throw in the towel just yet , you hear me ? Maybe we should go on over to the Chandler . No , you don 't . This is my home , at least for now , and I can have all the guests I want . Please , you guys . For moral support ? Do you have continental breakfast ? I don 't want you to think that I 'm ungrateful for what you 've done . It 's just that it 's been ... Well , it 's been a bit of a shock . We can understand that . Yeah , these days , we seem to spend an awful lot of time being shocked about one thing or another . Tell me about it . Kromaggs hit you pretty hard ? A lot of places got it worse . Moscow , New York , Paris . They 're simply not there anymore . Listen , how did you manage to drive the Kromaggs out ? I mean , from what I 've seen , they only leave when they 're ready , and that 's usually only after there 's nothing left . Our military developed better tactics . Better weapons . What kind of weapons ? I work in Central Intelligence . The weapons that we used are still classified . The general public doesn 't know anything about them . Hopefully they never will . Well , we 're just thinking that the Kromaggs are still ravaging many other worlds . This classified weapon might help defeat the Kromagg Dynasty completely . I 'm afraid the other worlds will have to do it on their own . Wow , you 're a hard man . I had to be , to save my world . Come on , Remmy . What you 're feeling , this ... This hatred that you have against the Kromaggs for what they did to you and yours ... I 've been down that road . Ate me alive . Made me blind to the people in my life . That is your daughter in there . She 's been through hell . And all she cared about was coming home to you . Now , try harder to think about that . Maybe don 't even think at all , just ... Just feel something . Wait a minute . You think of yourselves as her friends ? Well , we 're just getting to know her , but I think we 're headed that way , yeah . She trusts us , if that 's what you 're asking . The next few hours are going to be very difficult for her . If you could stay around . Help her through it . You 're not just saying it 's going to be hard on her coming home , are you ? No . You 're not thinking about doing anything crazy , like turning her in ? No , of course not . Nothing will happen to her . She 'll be fine . I can 't say any more than that . It 's just that she 'll need something that I cannot give her . Please , if you could stay with her . If you 've got a secret , you might feel a lot better getting it off your chest . Good , he 's quieting down . He 's been finicky lately . Teething . They seem to be growing in human . I 'm glad . Kromagg teeth can be really brutal coming in . Yeah , well , maybe that 's why they 're so bad-tempered . Oh , hello , hello . You know , when I was in the camps , what kept me going was thinking of my folks back here . Christmas , Thanksgiving . Just hanging around the backyard doing nothing . He 's not a bad man . Yeah , I know . I can see that . He 's just been through some really bad times . If only you could see him the way that I do . Listen , I 'm going to go rustle us up some soup , okay ? Okay . Okay , little guy ? Okay . How 's Christina ? She 's hanging in there . What 's wrong ? You have that little crease between your eyes you always get . It 's her father . He said to stick by her . Something was going to happen . Like what ? I don 't know . He wouldn 't say . Colin and Remmy went off to do some research . Library , newspapers . See what they could about the Kromagg defeat . Maybe it 's nothing , but everybody 's so stressed out . I got a bad feeling about this . I could really use a good feeling right about now . Like the one she gets when she looks at him . It seems like we 're always taking care of everybody else . When 's somebody going to take care of us , huh ? I guess we 've just gotta do it all . You ever think about having a kid ? My husband and I used to want one very much . But we had careers , and so we put it off . We put it off a little too long . You had no way of knowing . Well , you know , on some alternate world , I 've probably got 11 kids , I 'm barefoot , living in a shack on a mountain . I 'm sure you 'd make a great mom . For all 11 . Thanks , Quinn . Maggie . Maggie ! What 's wrong ? I don 't know . He 's not breathing right . Oh , he 's got a fever . I gotta get him to a doctor . Can you take him to anyone who you trust ? Who won 't turn you and the baby in ? I don 't know . Uh , Dr. Bailey . He brought me into this world . He 's taken care of me all my life . Let 's go . Forget about Bailey . Get away from the door . He won 't be able to help you . No one will . And just why is that ? You know , you 've been waltzing around here . Are you going to tell us what this is about ? Daddy ? During the war , our military research developed a virus that affected only Kromagg DNA . Very efficient . Extremely fast-acting . 100 % mortality . It permeates the atmosphere . That is why the Kromaggs left . The baby , being half-Kromagg , is obviously susceptible . You mean , he 's dying and there 's nothing that we can do about it ? Well , there 's gotta be an antidote . No . Being as it was designed not to affect humans , there ... You knew about this , and you didn 't tell me ? Christina ... If you would like , I could get something where ... He wouldn 't feel it . No . I want my baby to live . Do you understand me ? To live . You know , you are one sorry ... Who the hell are you ? Everyone be very still . Don 't touch him . You keep away from my baby . Be calm , Christina . He 's my baby , too . For God 's sake , kill him ! Come on , nobody 's going to shoot anyone . Don 't move , pal . This is my son . Your son ? You contribute some genetic material and you think that makes you a father ? You breed children like cattle . How many more sons do you have ? This virus is killing him . As it was designed to do . Well , is there an antidote ? A treatment of some kind ? Not for you . What about for him ? He 's your grandson . So there is a vaccine . Yes . The virus wasn 't designed to affect humans , but we didn 't know what would happen when it was released into the atmosphere . It could have mutated like Ebola-Zaire or Reston ... We weren 't sure that , once it took out the Kromaggs , it wouldn 't attack every living thing on this planet . So far , we haven 't had to use it . I came here to help my child . And the check 's in the mail . What about my son ? We can 't be sure that it would help him anyway . It was designed for humans . The baby 's own Kromagg blood is killing him . It 's worth the risk . Not to me . Oh , God , Christina , I 'm sorry . So am I. He 's going into his mind . Stop it . He 's not injured . I merely wanted to see if what he was saying was the truth . And ? The anti-virus is nearby . It 's in a lab , in a classified military facility . I 'll bring it here , and we will administer it to my son . I hate to sound like we don 't trust you , but we don 't trust you . She 's right . We can 't just let you waltz in there by yourself . No offense . Do you have any suggestions ? Well , I think we could start by , uh , keeping an eye on each other . Truce ? Truce . Not just yet . ... Colonel Jay Ewing , report to Base Operations . Uh ... Is there any plan here ? I thought we 'd just walk right in . They 'll see what I want them to see . Good afternoon , sir . Afternoon . These officers are from the Pentagon . I want to show them the AKV research establishment . Very well , Mr. Griffin , but you 'll need O-level clearance passes . We 've got them . Very impressive . We have to hurry . I cannot maintain this level of deception very much longer . Hey , there . I 'm glad somebody 's found time to take a nap . I 'm sorry . We couldn 't find out anything about the Kromagg war . All the information was censored by the military . The librarian , she looked at us pretty funny when we started asking , so we figured it was just best to beat it out of there . It was a virus . Excuse me ? That 's how they won the war . They released a virus into the air that only kills Kromaggs . Wait a minute , how do you know this ? The Kromagg commander of the camp I was in , the baby 's father , he followed us here . What ? Where 's Quinn and Maggie ? We 're here . What are we going to do about the O-clearance ? Dr. Griffin . Dr. Townsend . You 're still on the AKV Project . They won 't let me off it . Ah . Tough gig . The worst . My colleagues here are in from DC for a week . Fact-finding junket . That sort of thing . I 'd like to show them the , uh , latest work being done on the virus . Sorry I have to ask , but do you have your O - level pass with you ? Rules , rules , rules . Don 't know what the brass is so interested in this stuff for . There 's no chance of a Kromagg being on this planet . Right .

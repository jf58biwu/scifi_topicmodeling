 Hey , hey hey . I am doing it . Whoa . Wait . I 'm-I 'm not doing it . You 're doing it barely , but just ... Don 't-don 't show me . Don 't show me . Port side . Port side thrusters . Slicker 'n snot . My microbes had to have translated that one wrongly . Southern metaphors , darlin ' . You ain 't heard the half of em . You know , you 're picking this up more slowly than the dumbest recruit . But I am picking it up , Aeryn . The more I modify my module with Moya add-ons ... the more I need to understand biomechanoid technology . Now , you do that one again and I 'll kill you . Oh , sorry . I almost hit that big sun out there . There 's nothing out there , John . Exactly , Aeryn . That 's why we picked this spot . Nothing for me to hit . Perfect for a driving lesson ... like a big mall parking lot on a Sunday morning . I used to have 70,000 servants . Rygel , why don 't you get yourself something to eat ? And during festivals , I used to have 50,000 more . Mostly females . Rygel ? They would worry about my every nanomoment . Make sure I was always smiling , always entertained ... - Rygel ! - And never bored ! I 'm bored . - Bored , bored , bored ! - Will you stop doing that ? ! Look , whatever you 're doing there it can 't be important . You 're just scared I 'll win . Come on , let 's play . I can 't take Moya 's pregnancy much longer . The walls of my cell are excreting some sort of gel ... and Pilot says it is due to Moya 's condition . The center chamber has taken on some kind of strange odor as well . Have you noticed ? I have a Luxan 's olfactory sense . How can I not notice ? Where the hezmana are Crichton and Aeryn ? They should be back by now . - Teaching Crichton takes time , D 'Argo . - Teaching Crichton is a waste of time . Am I the only one here who remembers we are being tracked by bounty hunters ? Aeryn believes that anything we can do to make Crichton more effective , the better . This sector is very peaceful . It 's perfect for Crichton 's trai ... Rygel ! If you do not stop that this instant ... You 'll what ? Please do tell . It may be preferable to this mind-numbing tedium . Shut up ! Aeryn , lighten up ! Have some fun . Fun ? How am I to have fun ? Well , I don 't know how you 're supposed to have fun , but this is fun . This is Top Gun , this is The Need for Speed , you like this stuff , admit it . I have no need for speed . Yes , you do . I see it in your eye all the time . You miss the adrenaline of combat flying . I miss the teamwork of combat flying . The reason why I agreed to teach you to do this , is because you may become vaguely of some use to me one day in battle . Oh . Well . Thank you for that vote of confidence . Well , you may have noticed we 're short of hands . I didn 't exactly have much choice . Watch out for the starboard thrusters , you 're banking too sharply ! I got it . What exactly do you mean by vaguely useful ? You 're hardly a quick learner , are you ? Oh . You 're trying to telling me you weren 't the least bit challenged , learning to fly one of these things ? Not challenged the way you seem to be . And you have it easy , here . In Peacekeeper training , there 's no room for mistakes . You screw up on the last day of simulation flying , you die . Right . The simulator kills you . Now why does that not surprise me ? What are you doing back there ? Getting something to eat . I always get hungry when I ... - What was that ? - What was that ? What did you touch ? I didn 't touch anything ! Aeryn , any idea what this is ? No , I don 't ! There 's something pulling us in . Still pulling us in . I 'm not getting any pulse-back soundings . That 's impossible . Well , you think I 'm making this up ? Lookit ... there 's nothing out there . I can 't hold her ! Aeryn ! Aeryn ! You okay ? Aeryn ! Damn . Don 't scare me like that . Scare you ? What , you think I had something to do with that ? No , I thought you might ... never mind . You gonna be alright ? Think so . You ? If you don 't count a broken neck . A couple of aspirin , I 'll be fine . - We hit something . - No , we didn 't . Hey , look . I was in a head-on when I was 19 . We hit something . There 's nothing out there . There 's no mass readings . No mass ? How can there be no mass ? Something 's blocking our view . The sensors say there 's still nothing out there . - What the hell does that mean ? ! - I don 't know . Will you stop playing with that ? I will play this game for as long as I like ... Give it to me ... You are ... Pilot ! - So sorry . I appear to have hit the wrong Comm . - You desired our attention , Pilot . An unidentified vessel is approaching . It is signalling , asking permission to come aboard . Is it armed ? - It depends . - What do you mean " it depends " ? Moya 's scan has found traces of weapon pieces . Pieces ? But nothing that constitutes a whole weapon , and certainly nothing that is operational . It seems a most ... curious vessel . The name 's Staanz . Oh , there 's no need for the firepower , friend . I disagree ... " friend " . Move . That pretty little female here 's not gonna look at you in quite the same way when she learns you 've killed the only person who could 've saved you . Saved us from what ? You see how much you need me ? You 're headed straight for it and you don 't even know it 's there . Headed for what ? - The Flax . - What is that ? It 's a magna-drift mesh 75 million zachrons long . I 've never heard of anything called " the flax . " - And what species are you ? - Luxan . Luxan ? Never heard of it . Doesn 't mean you don 't exist . Our ship 's sensors have not picked up anything that size in this area . Well , they wouldn 't have picked up much of anything , would they ? That 's the flax . It 's invisible until you get snagged in it and then ... It 's all over . - Who put it there ? - Zenetan pirates . What , you never heard of them ? - Consider yourself lucky . - I will warn Crichton and Aeryn . Heh , you got another ship out there ? Warning them 's probably a good idea ... if you 're not already too late . What exactly are you ? My name 's Staanz . I 'm a garbologist . I 'm a ... connossieur of what other people throw away . Define " connossieur . " Tadek , eh ? You 're set 's in ... uh ... very nice shape . - Do you play ? - Oh , I used to ... dabble . You any good ? Perhaps you can 't give me a few ... pointers . Perhaps I can . We need to get the ship stabilized and assess the damage . " Stabilized ? " According to this , we 're too stable . We 're not moving . There 's no drift , no spin ... What ? I-I don 't know . It 's as if we 're suspended in one place . The sooner we get this thing fixed and blast the hell out of here , the better . No comms signal . Probably busted in the crash . No , the equipment 's working just fine ... it 's just there 's no signal out there . Aeryn , if I 'm reading this right , calorics are flat-line . We don 't have any power . Oh , that 's impossible . I fed the batteries just before we left Moya . Yeah . Impossible . This isn 't good . I can 't make contact with the transport pod . Aeryn and Crichton aren 't responding . They can 't be that far out . Staanz 's story about the flax could be true . It could be what 's affecting the comm transmission . If it is ... if he did come to warn us ... then the question is , what does he want from us in return ? Anything he can get his hands on . I 've just accessed the criminal ident files from the Peacekeepers . It seems our Mr. Staanz has quite a record . He came offering help ! Shouldn 't we at least give him the benefit of the doubt ? We don 't know that the Flax doesn 't exist . And what if it does ? He may be leading us straight into it . For all we know , he could be one of those bounty hunters . No , Staanz is trouble . And we do not need to take that risk , especially while Moya is pregnant ! I agree that Staanz may be the most unusual species , but you can 't surely condemn him , just because he is an ex prisoner of the Peacekeepers ! - Are you forgetting that we are all ex prisoners ? - How could I ever forget ? Have you ever looked at your own records to see what lies the Peacekeepers have written about you ? Have you ? Not everyone imprisoned by the Peacekeepers was innocent . Meaning ? Meaning that I do not have time to stand here and discuss this with you , while he is looting what precious little we have ! Interesting move . Very unconventional . Care to raise the stakes ? Ossoh scent . - How pure ? - 90 parts . They won 't be able to resist ... even you . What are you doing ? I was just about to raise the ... I had him right where I wanted him ! You have a criminal record with the Peacekeepers . Do you have any idea how difficult that is in this game ? I have criminal records with a lot of people ! It 's who I am . Doesn 't mean his money 's no good . I don 't deserve it . I never robbed anybody ... well , I used to rob anybody ... but now I 'm an honest garbologist . Ask anyone . I can give you a list of names ... well , it 's a couple of names ... Aaah ! Hey ! I used to be a Zenetan . One of the pirates who run the flax and loot ships that get caught in it . I can prove it . If you put me down . Thank you . Slowly . Oh , for heaven 's sake . Zenetan gang murals ? I spent nine cycles in a malsonic labor stockade . My Zenetan " brothers " did nothing to help me . In fact , cause of what they were doing on the outside , I got beat close to death more than once on the inside . So ... when I got out , I went my own way . I work for myself now . Part of the fun is getting to the flax before they do . Also , I like warning people like you . Pisses the Zenetans off no end . Anyway , I figure when you send me on my way ... you might give me , I don 't know , a small reward ? Put those back on . - Where are your , uh ... your , uh ... your ... - My , uh ... ? For an anthropoid biped , there 's seems to be something missing . Yeah , I know . Well , I 'm a Yenen by species . We 're not exactly ... cut from the standard mold . If you are truly interested in helping us , our transport pod is still out there . Two of our complement are aboard and we 've lost contact . - They 're not family ? - No . Good . There 's nothing worse than losing family . We don 't . Get a move on , Crichton . The message buoy 's almost ready so we 'll need power to launch it . I 'm working as fast as I can , Aeryn , but these schematics are hard to read ... like half cat-scan , half blueprint . I know you don 't read them at all . Don 't be ridiculous , it 's tech work . What happens if you crash-land your Prowler , and you have to repair it ? We 're not trained to repair , we 're trained find and secure somebody else 's ship . Secure ? As in , take by force . Well . It beats uh , learning to read those . Not today , it doesn 't . I think ... I 've redirected the remaining power from the auxilary systems . Message buoy away . - You ready to go home ? - Very . - Staanz . Where did you get those boots ? - Huh ? Let me go ! Let me go ! Those boots are Luxan . A Luxan would never lose his boots unless he were dead . I didn 't kill him , he was already dead ! His ship got caught in the flax ! Oh , so you robbed the dead . No , no ... a Zenetan killed him . He ejected ... He ejected the body ! I tried to get aboard the ship , but ... look ! They blasted the crank outta me . You tried to loot a dead Luxan ship . Of course I did . That 's what I do ! I see a ship , I try and loot it . Well that ship , my friend , was a Luxan Deep-Space Voyager . Now , it may have on board some map fibers that I desperately need . Can you take me there ? Well , I don 't know . It was ... earmarked for destruction . They might 've already ... melted it down . If you take me there , everything on board after I get those map fibers is yours ... Well , that sounds like a deal to me . - What about the flax ? - Oh , not a problem . If ... you know what you 're doing . Let 's do this while we still have power . 200 trads , are we clear ? Not yet . I 'm increasing to 80 % . This is gonna hurt , isn 't it ? 300 trads . Should I punch it ? 90 % . - Should I punch it ? ! - Not yet . 400 trads . - Now ? - It 's too storng , I can 't hold her ! - Now , Aeryn ! Now ! - 500 trads . Clear ! - Now ? - Wait ! - Man , this is really gonna hurt ... - Now ! Crichton ! Aeryn , were are you ? I haven 't the faintest idea . Aw , man . I knew this was gonna hurt . I 'll be alright if I can get it out . Can you pass me that ax ? Yeah . - What are you going to do with it ? - I 'm going to hack my foot off . - Oh , no . Well , let me , then . - Oh , just give it to me . Did we break free ? Right . You mind if I check that in a minute ? I wanna get these flames out first . D 'Argo , the distress buoy 's broadcasting full coordinates . Aeryn 's message is short , but it 's clear . The transport pod is caught in some sort of stasis but they see no stars . That 's the flax , alright . We are aboard Staanz 's vessel now and ready to launch . - Wish us luck . - Rha 'nalan be with you . A triple quadra-hent . That means nothing to you , but ... I would have won all this fair and square . Even if he hadn 't left it behind . Luxan Voyager , here we come ! When I get her really firing I can get this baby up to Hetch 4 ! - It stinks in here . - What ? It stinks ! Oh , does it ? I had my smell pods cauterized . Helps in my line of work . You mean you actually go out of your way to collect all these things ? I follow space streams and I pick up what other 's throw away . - That 's all garbage . - Garbage ? I don 't touch garbage . I 'm a professional scavenger . I only pick up the gems of what others throw away . I 've got 9 million onnyxi play partners . They particalize , they levitate ... everything ! One day I 'm gonna sell these babies and make a killing . They burn good , too . You say that you can take me to this Luxan ship . Unless it 's already been melted down . You and me go on board , get what we need , stay no longer than an arn , and then we go to rescue Aeryn and Crichton . - You said they 'll be safe for a while . - Well , they 're stuck in the flax . They 're going nowheres . You said it was a small pod ? The Zenetans aren 't gonna be in a rush to get there . Oh , we have plenty of time . Okay . Come on , baby ... come on ! We 're not moving . We 're till stuck . I think there 's some sort of field out there holding us in place . - You mean like a natural phenomenon ? - You ever hear of a natural phenomenon like that ? Well , whatever it is , we have to find a way to break free . Any suggestions ? The distress buoy got away . Well , I guess we just wait for ... D 'Argo and the others to come rescue us . - I 'll deal with propulsion system . - I 'll take environmentals . Go on , have a chew ! It 's delicious ! No , not that bit . It 's got to rot a bit more . Here , try this . No , I think I 'll pass . Hang on . If I don 't get to this , she 's going to blow ! What ? ! Come on , baby ! - Why don 't you just get it fixed ? - I did fix it . That 's why it works when I whack it a few times . Help me ! - Oh , no . - What ? Hang on . You see that ? That 's Kcrackic 's tracer beam . - Who 's Kcrackic ? - He 's red mentor to the Zenetans . Is that like a rank ? No , there 's nothing military about these guys except their firepower . Then why are you so afraid of him ? I 'm not afraid , exactly . It 's just ... maybe I should 've mentioned it earlier , but ... I 'm kind of on Kcrackic 's hate-list . I told a few of his secrets to get out of prison . So you betrayed your own leader ... Betray ? Never . Look , the bottom line is ... if he knows where we 're at , he 's gonna seal the flax up ... and we 're not gonna get to that Luxan ship ... or your friends . He missed us . But he 's headed straight for your ship . For Moya ? Warn them ... they 've never heard of me ! They 've never seen me ! I understand , D 'Argo . We will strive to keep them distracted as long as we can . I will strive to keep them distracted . Greetings . I am Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan . You are Kcrackic ? You know me ? Your reputation is well-known in these parts . - For what ? - Cruelty . My scan shows that your leviathan is pregnant . You 're lucky . Why ? I once tried to commandeer a pregnant leviathan . 80 men died . A mother will protect her child . A tracer ship was last seen heading in this direction , run by a pewnkah named Staanz . Have you seen it ... or him ? - No . Perhaps I can offer you and your men something to eat ? - You offer us nothing . What we want from your ship , we take . And I see nothing of value here . Let 's go . Commander Kcrackic , may I present Rygel XVI , Dominar of ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . How do you do ? Pleased to meet you and all that yotz . Where did you get so many kelvic crystals , little one ? I won them . - Playing tadek ? - No , inter-species tugg wrestling . Idiot . So you believe you play well . I know I play well . And you , I believe , are an easy mark . I 'm still not getting a clear reading . More than half the pod 's sensor relays have been fried . Do you think Moya 's got that distress buoy yet ? Don 't know . But even if she did , if we don 't buy ourselves a couple of hours ... arns ... we 'll be dead by the time anybody gets here . The atomspherics mix line is crushed . - Can you fix it ? - Maybe . I might be able to weld it , but I 'd need a welding torch . There should be one in the equipment pack . The problem is ... there 's too much pure O2 in here right now to risk firing it up . What about if we depressurize ? Blast it out into space ? - Fix it in our suits ? - Yeah . Aeryn , that 's a great idea . You sound surprised . You okay ? - Yes . You ? - Yeah ... just ... peachy . Are you comfortable ? Shall I get you a pillow ? Do you think your people have kept Kcrackic occupied ? Well , why don 't we just call Moya and ask them ? Perhaps you can speak to Kcrackic himself . Let 's get out of here . Kcrackic isn 't the kind of person you give a second chance to find you . Come on . Sing for daddy . Sing ! What 's wrong ? Oh , nothing , nothing . Sometimes she just needs a bit of a push to get going . - A push ? ! - Yeah , you know . Like a grav-spin around a planet , or something ? I need you to get me to that ship fast so I can find that map fiber . If you want to get there , open the furnace . Hmm ? This had better work . Come on , burn ! Come on ! Burn , baby , burn ! Okay ... here we go ... Oh , great ! What 's wrong ? We 're caught in the flax . Impressive . We 'll be out of here in a few microts . Rygel , surely you 're not going to give up so early ? Who 's giving up ? I 'm not giving up . Leave me alone . I know what I 'm doing . Ante up , Hynerian . It 's going to be like a wind tunnel in here when we depressurize . I 'll get the release sequence started and leave out the last line ... that might save us ... We have a problem . What 's the matter ? - It 's broken . Is there another one of those ? - Exactly that . One . So one of us gets to die . Torch looks like it 's in working condition . Unfortunately , there 's no way to test it before we depressurize . Kill shot . We use them in battle triage . They stop brain and heart functions . And this is a nerve shot . You use this one to bring me back . Whoa , hold the phone . Let 's talk about this . There 's nothing to talk about . You know welding ... you should do the repairs . - Yeah , but Aeryn , that means that you ... - They are sebacean . They are meant to be used on my kind . - Yeah , but still ... - The oxygen is rising in here quickly so you 'd better get ready . Aeryn , you notice anything about that ? It 's useless . It 's also mine . Yours isn 't gonna fit me . Tell me exactly what I have to do . We could wait . The others may come . No ... we gotta fix the line , otherwise we 're both dead anyway . And if we get another spot-fire in this place , it 's going to go up like a blast furnace . How long do I have to do the repairs ? I don 't know . Without oxygen , my brain can last four minutes ... maybe five or six depending on my body temperature . Pick a number . Tell me how long I have and I 'll follow it ... but show me what to do while there 's still time . Torch . Shall I tell Baca to fire up the engines ? Why not ? I should be there shortly . Very unusual move . Where did you learn it ? Uh ... I made it up myself . Did you ? I know somebody else who makes that move . Good for you . You sure this thing 's going to work ? Mm-hmm . It should kill you . Well , it 's not the kill shot that concerns me . I 'm sure you guys got that one down fine . It 's the wake-up call that 's got me worried . Well , we can 't be sure it works until you 're dead . Great . It works perfectly well on sebaceans and sebeacean and human physiology appears to be similar enough , so ... I say 50-50 . You call that good odds ? No . No , no , no . I 'm gonna teach you CPR . - What 's that ? - It 's a human resuscitation technique , Aeryn ... very low-tech . We don 't have time for this . Aeryn , I got time , okay ? I need a back-up plan in case your little nerve shot doesn 't work , Aeryn . What does it involve ? It involves you breathing for me ... keeping my blood flowing so I don 't die . Don 't be ridiculous . It sounds far too complicated . Well , it 's a lot less complicated than learning to fly a transport pod . Fine . Show it to me , then . - Good . Lie down . - What ? Lie down ! No , flat out , on the gr - , I can 't show you .. lay down ! Okay . Come on ! Where are the stars ? The Flax magna absorbs the light before it can get to us . It 's a bummer like that . Absorbs the light ? If it 's that powerful , how come you 're not more concerned ? Because I might be able to dissolve a small part of the flax ... unless they 've already changed the code . What ? ! Now what I need from you is ... to whack this really hard on my signal . Whack it really hard ! Ready ? Three ... two ... one ... whack it ! Come on , baby ! Come on ! You can do it , D 'Argo ! That 's it . Totally . Come on . Yes ! We 've done it ! We 've cleared the flax ! We 're clear ! Didn 't I say it ? Hey , stop whacking it . We 're clear . We 've made it . Ha ! Go with me brother ! We 're clear ! It doesn 't get better than this , baby ! 13 ... 14 ... 15 ... then 2 more breaths and 15 more compressions Right , until I start breathing again on my own ... or not . Let 's do it . You 've got about 4 minutes ... 180 microts ... before my brain starts to go adios . Let 's do it . In the chair . Aeryn , it 's real simple what you gotta do to fix the line . I remember what you told me . Hey ... when sebaceans die , what do you believe happens ? You believe in an afterlife ? Heaven and hell ? All that jazz ? Humans believe ... well , some believe ... that there 's this bright light . And that you , uh , end up somewhere else along with your friends , family , relatives ... all the people who died before you . Does that ring a bell ? Sebaceans believe when you die you die . You go nowhere ; you see nothing . Yeah , guess I 'll find out in a minute , huh ? Okay . 180 microts . - Yes , I know . - Well , sorry if I 'm repeating myself , it 's just , you know ... I don 't want to take any chances with this , so ... I won 't let you down , John . This ... this is gonna hurt like crap , isn 't it ? Trust me , this is not going to hurt a bit . That 's it ? Well , it doesn 't hurt ... The engine 's are fired up ... ready to go . Your wager , your lordship . But we have nothing left to bet . This ship . I 'll wager this ship . - You can 't do that , Rygel ! - I can beat him ! I know I can . Fear not , lovely lady . I told you before I 've had my experience with pregnant leviathans . I don 't want your ship . I reject your wager . Quit now . You must quit ! - The one you call Staanz ... I know where he is . - Rygel ! I wager his whereabouts ! You now have 60 microts ... 59 ... 58 ... 57 ... 56 ... 55 ... 54 ... 53 ... Hey , I 'm picking up some traces of atmopshere . Atmosphere ? Yeah , they 're drifting from the coordinates where your ship 's pod is caught in the flax . Oh , and it 's not just mere traces , either . Looks like your friends might be out of luck . We may have no reason to rush aboard that Luxan ship . 14 ... 13 ... 12 ... Time has lapsed . Time has lapsed . Time has lapsed . Ha ha ! I knew it ! I knew I could do it ! - Thanks for the game . - But the game is not over . Thank you for the game , little one . - Now , for that nugget of information you promised me . - Rygel , don 't . You 'll tell me , or he 'll blow your brains out . I 'll count to three . One ... two ... three . Okay . Staanz was here . One of our crew is with him now . You can locate him by following the frequency of our crew member 's comm unit . What 's the frequency ? It 's in the ship 's data store . Access the ship 's data stores . And let 's go get him . Crichton ! 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... come on , Crichton . Wake up . 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ... Aeryn and Crichton have a second reserve tank . They could still be alive . Look ... there she is ! Your Luxan beauty . Oh , you 're lucky . We 're just in time . She 's next in line for the melt . It 's a Luxan Assault Piercer . I dreamt of serving on one as a boy . I 'll bring her in nice and easy . Come on ! What are you looking so down about ? You said yourself the two aboard that pod aren 't family . Look , the maps aboard that ship might be your only chance ... to reunite with your real family , huh ? - My son . - Yeah , yeah . Your son ! 13 ... 14 ... Come on ! Come on ! My god . You did it , Aeryn . You did it . But you lied like a dog . God , that hurt like hell . How 'd it go ? The environmentals ? Do you fix ? I-I didn 't finish . You didn 't what ? Your time was running out . Wait a minute ... you stopped because ... I think we have about half an arn of breathable atmosphere left . - I thought we 'd never be rid of them . - You wanted them to leave ! - Didn 't you ? - Yes , but I ... You didn 't expect them to leave us unscathed unless they thought they were leaving with something of value , did you ? You gave them the comm frequency . The wrong frequency , yes . I told Pilot to change it the moment Kcrackic stepped on board . - Where are they headed , Pilot ? - Not exactly certain . - I could plot it for you . - No , no problem . As long as it 's far from here . Ah . It 's certainly that . You lost to Kcrackic on purpose ? You think it was easy ? He 's an abominable player . A switched-off DRD would have made a better showing for itself . Oh , please . Bluffing is what the game 's all about . The message buoy got out . They could still come for us . Maybe they 've been trying this whole time . The phenomenon that 's got hold of us might not be letting them through . They might 've tried and given up already . Oh ... it 's really cold in here . It 's colder than a frog 's ass . Okay . We 're docking . If I get this right , we 'll be nice and snug in the aft access port . Oh , c 'mon , you gotta be a bit excited . You 're 15 paces away from your own Luxan Assault Piercer . The maps ... you 'll be able to find your son ! You gotta be looking forward to seeing your son , huh ? Yes . But when I do , I want to be able to look him in the eye . Aeryn ... you should have kept working ... finished the repair . At least one of us would have survived . To be sitting here alone now ? I chose not to . I thought Peacekeepers were trained to fight alone , survive alone . Die alone . Well , it appears my training is failing me . I don 't want to die alone . What did you see ? Y-you know , after the kill shot , when you were dead ... did you see the things humans believe ? The light . Friends . No . No , I didn 't . All I saw was black . I don 't know , maybe sebaceans are right . Maybe there 's nothing after death . Maybe ... Maybe ... I wasn 't supposed to die that time . Maybe you 'll find out for certain this time . Somebody docking ? ! D 'Argo ! What took you so long ? I had to ... uh ... find someone to help me . Right . I think it 's time that we left . It 's about time ! Hey , your friends are okay ! I told you they would be . D 'you think you could untie me , please ? This is not fun . Hey , welcome aboard , people ! I 'd offer you something to chew , but hey ... my hands are kinda tied . Is he dangerous ? Merely annoying . The flax is huge . There 's bound to be another Luxan ship in there somewhere . I thought ... maybe we could go and look for it ... together ? We go together ? Hmph . I 'm lonely . Everybody needs a mate , Ka D 'Argo . - Even you . - A mate ? I am the female of the species , you know that , don 't you ? In fact , false modesty aside , I 'm ... I 'm considered quite the Zenetan beauty . You know , big guy , I think I 'd better ... give you two a little time alone here ... 'cause you know , in a universe this vast when ... two hearts collide ... Shut up . You and me ? I don 't really ... I love you . Um . Well , you ... uh ... I love you . I love you ! We are now well out of the range of the flax ... and Kcrackic 's tracer . What happened out there , D 'Argo ? D 'Argo ? A Luxan warrior must never be indecisive in battle . My indecision nearly cost Crichton and Aeryn their lives . - But you saved them . - Barely ... and by saving them , I may have given up my only chance at seeing my son again . On every front ... I failed . Heat of the moment . Exactly . - Too much pure oxygen . - Affected our judgement . If had been you and D 'Argo there , the same thing probably would have happened . Or you and Zhaan . Anyway , one thing 's for sure ... it 'll never ... never happen again . Never . Never . Never . One thing ... just to be ... absolutely certain . You are the female of your species , right ? I 'll take that as a yes .

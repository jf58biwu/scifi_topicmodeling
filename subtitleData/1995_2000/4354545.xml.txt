 [ Train Whistle , Distant ] [ Footsteps ] [ Laughs ] I got you , you self-righteous son of a - [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] - Ah , ah , ah ! - [ Cries Out ] - Don 't mess with me , Detective , especially with this gun . - [ Gun Cocks ] It 's a.44 Magnum . I saw a guy in a movie use one once . Highly effective . What you gonna do , Jarod ? Shoot your own partner ? Why not ? You shot yours . Detective Santora knew too much , didn 't he ? About your kickbacks from the Eighth Avenue dealers . About your private stash of heroin , courtesy of the evidence locker . You 're an addict , Detective . Your partner found out , so you killed him . Oh . Like I 'm gonna do you . [ Laughs ] You fired six shots , you moron . And , oh , by the way , you were right about Santora . If he wouldn 't have been such an overachiever ... I wouldn 't have had to shoot him between the eyes . You ever seen that in a movie ? No . But I saw that in a cartoon . Gotcha . - [ Beeping ] - [ Heavy Metal ] [ Continues ] [ Typing ] " Another game , Joshua ? " " You 're on , Bryce . How about face-to-face ? " I knew you 'd come . - Man-to-man . - Joshua ? - You look surprised . - You said you were in the eighth grade . I was - [ Chuckles ] A long time ago . Your daddy should have taught you to never trust strangers on the Internet . - I thought you were my friend . - I 'm better than that , kid . Much better . I 'm your brother . Help ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! [ Engine Starts ] Where are you taking me ? What 's going on ? [ Beeping ] [ Man ] Good work , Doyle . Maybe there 's some dirty cops ... in Minnesota you can take care of . Never seen a cop transfer in and out as fast as you did , Doyle . I have a very short attention span , sir . - Minneapolis is lucky to have you . - Thank you . - This your family ? - Uh , yes . I hope to update those photographs soon . - Haven 't seen ' em in a while , hmm ? - No , sir . - [ Woman On Radio ] This is Dispatch . Over . - Go ahead , Dispatch . Decatur Division reported a 207 . Thirteen-year-old boy residing at 439 Oakbrook Road . A kidnapping ? This is Detective Doyle . - I 'm rolling to the scene . - What about Minneapolis ? - I have to do this . - Why ? I have a thing about kidnappings . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Siren Blaring , Distant ] I 'm Detective Doyle . What have we got ? What we got is what we don 't have . Namely , her son ... Bryce Banks . Thirteen , straight-A student , captain of the chess club . Mom goes in last night about 10.30 , kisses him good night . Wakes up this morning , and he 's gone . His father is a strict disciplinarian . Mom 's just a mom . She 's pretty shaken up . I don 't even want to imagine what these people are goin ' through right now . They took Jarod ! My son ! Where is he ? Where is he ? Detective ? Detective ? Hmm ? - Are you with me , Doyle ? - I 'm with you . Daddy , I got your message . - Everything all right ? - Angel , I need your help . - My help ? - It 's Brigitte . - Oh . - Look ... I know how hard it 's been for you since Thomas 's death . I 'd really just rather ... move on . That 's what I 'm tryin ' to do - move on , make my marriage work . But Brigitte ? I don 't know what the hell 's going on . I mean , this erratic behavior , mood swings - She changed her hair color again . This morning I found her crying in the shower , for God 's sake . Daddy , I don 't see how I can be of any help . Well , reach out to her , woman-to-woman . I mean , relate to her , find out what 's bothering her . Daddy , Bridget and I aren 't exactly bosom buddies . Angel , please . Remember , she 's family now , hmm ? - [ Police Radio Chatter ] - [ Men Chattering ] [ Detective ] The kid 's a prodigy . When it comes to chess ... Bryce Banks is the Michael Jordan of the checkerboard . - Can you tell me what happened ? - [ Jarod ] I don 't think your son was taken . At least not from here . There are no signs of a struggle . And the only fingerprints on this open window are your son 's . - Bryce would never run away . - Are you sure ? There 's something else , isn 't there ? He slammed this down before he left . He slammed it down because of the tournament . Bryce was supposed to compete in the City Chess Final on Saturday ... but he wanted to go skateboarding with his friends ... and Philip wouldn 't let him . - You had an argument . - I worked my tail off for that kid . - He never appreciated it . - Oh , God ! - It 's true . - Bryce is gone , and we don 't know where . - Can 't that wait ? - [ Jarod ] When you came in to say good night ... did you notice anything strange about the way your son was acting ? I could see how disappointed he was , missing the trip with his friends . But before I left , he was back on the computer . - [ Typing ] - [ Jarod ] He traded e-mails with somebody named Joshua . They arranged to meet for the first time last night ... face-to-face , to play chess . [ Mrs. Banks ] Could Joshua be the kidnapper ? [ Jarod ] We 're going to find out . [ Detective 's Voice ] There was a report of a bomb exploding here around 12.05 . What 's with the explosives ? Looks like the kidnapper wanted to destroy all evidence . He used a highly flammable explosive ... like napalm . That seems like overkill . Why not just grab the kid and be done with it ? That 's a good question . Which leaves us right back in the dark . In the e-mails , the kidnapper asked Bryce to meet him here . How did they both know this place ? [ Detective ] Chess tournament . Statewide event . Covers players from all over the southeast . [ Jarod ] And it 's open to the public . Yeah . Maybe the guy 's some crazed kiddie chess fan or something . Uh-uh . It runs deeper than that . [ Young Jarod ] You never let me play games . Mr. Raines , I don 't understand . When you 're the best at what you do , Jarod ... people stand up and notice . The kidnapper wants Bryce because he 's the best . He covets the superior mind . Yes , Father . Yes , sir . He 'll be ready when the time comes . What are you gonna do to me ? I 'm going to give you immortality . What 's that for ? It 's for you , Joshua . I want to see my mom and dad . I told you , Joshua . You have a new father now . - My name 's Bryce ! - Your name is Joshua , just like me ! Y-You can 't understand . But you 're brilliant . You 'll learn . - Why are you doing this to me ? - Because you 're special . My people have talked to everybody involved with the chess tournament ... - and come up with zero . - Well , they missed something . The tournament was the only place that the kidnapper could have watched Bryce perform . The boy 's a prodigy , the ultimate trophy . You may be right about that , Detective . Uh , Jarod , this is Samantha Waters , the F.B.I. ' s top profiler . I 'm with the Violent Crimes Task Force here in Atlanta . Violent Crimes ? But this is a kidnapping . Well , it may be more than that , Detective . A lot more . Your kidnapper 's M.O. Matches that of a man ... who abducted eight boys in Maryland and Virginia in the late 1980s . We got a red flag related to the previous unsolved case files . The last three boys were taken within weeks of each other in 1989 . Uh , Michael Taylor , Theodore Reed and Harry Dunn . " Each victim was between 11 and 13 years of age . Each displayed accelerated intelligence . " " Trace evidence destroyed at the scene with a highly flammable explosive . " - This sounds like our guy . - Were any of these boys found ? Yeah , we found six of the boys , but they 'd been killed . Two of them are still missing - Michael Taylor and Theodore Reed . Harry Dunn was the last boy taken . [ Sighs ] Your conclusion ? Sam ? These children , they may not be trophies . They ... may be subjects . It 's almost as if the kidnapper 's putting them through ... some sort of testing procedure ... and weeding out the weak and rejecting them . By dumping them in the woods . How is it going on locating the Banks boy ? The C.I.D. Was able to isolate a partial shoe print ... outside the blast area - size 12 . By the indentation , I could guess he was about 6 foot 2 , 200 pounds . By the indentation , I could guess he was about 6 foot 2 , 200 pounds . Well , I don 't think that this guy relies on physical size to intimidate . I think that this is all about emotional control . His screen name was Joshua . He traded e-mails with Bryce before Bryce vanished . All right . Well , I 'll go over everything in detail ... and hopefully I 'll be able to come up with a more complete profile for you . - May I ask you one more thing ? - Of course you can . The last boy that was kidnapped - the boy in the photograph - How long was he held before he was killed ? Seventy-two hours . Maybe less . Hello ? Bridget ? - Brigitte ? - [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing Continues ] [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] The woman is a junkie . - What are you gonna tell your father ? - The truth . What else ? It will be your word against Bridget 's . - I 'll get proof . - How 're you gonna do that ? Would you like one ? - I haven 't seen one of these in a while . - They 're very good . Thank you . - " Invisible . " - Invisible ? That 's how Bryce refers to himself in these e-mails . He said that his father pushed him so hard , he felt as if he didn 't exist . The other victims had similar relationships with their parents ... specifically their fathers . So , they all suffered deep psychological wounds caused by strained parental relationships . They were all emotionally cut off from them . Vulnerable . Jarod ? I don 't think you ever get used to seeing things like that . A lot of cops I know grow cold to it out of necessity . I wish I could figure out how . What-What is this ? Some kind of shorthand or - Oh . It 's , uh - It 's nothing . It 's just something I made up as a child to ... keep the wrong people from reading my diary . I think that Bryce wanted his privacy too ... but his father wouldn 't let him have it . I think that his father wanted him to be something that he never was or ever could be - a star . [ Mr. Banks 's Voice ] This is ridiculous . You 're saying the kidnapper was at the tournament ? - This is pathetic . - Philip - - No ! I 'm not gonna stand by while the police chase dead ends . He hasn 't even made a ransom demand yet . He may not . You think this man might kill our son no matter what we do ? The kidnapper may have been stalking your son at the tournament . Now can you remember anyone who paid particular attention to Bryce ? - Uh , a teacher , a tutor , anybody ? - I taught my son chess . There was that journalist at the season 's first tournament . I don 't remember his name , but I remember thinking he was strange . - Strange how ? - He said he was gonna do a feature on Bryce . But he hadn 't even made it to the city finals yet . You think he could 've taken my son ? We 'll see what we can track down . Well , somebody better start doin ' something . Detectives , wait , please . About the way my husband is acting - We-We understand he 's under a lot of pressure . [ Scoffs ] That 's no excuse . My son thinks he 's invisible to his father . We need another chance to make this right . Please , please , find my son . - Hey , anything new ? - Nothing so far . I 've got George cross-referencing the Banks kid with all the missing boys . Friends , schools , the whole nine yards . Now , except for the fact they could all be in Mensa , there 's no other connection . We 're going through it , Sam , but the process is slow . - Yeah , I know . - You okay ? Yeah , I 'm all right . I 'm , uh - I 'm working with this detective . His name is Doyle . Jarod Doyle . - He 's good . It 's just - - But what ? I don 't know . It 's just - I 'm tired . It 's this case - these kids . - Be careful , Sam . - I will . Bye-bye . Hello ? I must be crazy . [ Brigitte ] Ooh , goody ! There 's nobody home . - [ Man Chuckling ] - You are so naughty ! [ Laughing ] Mmm ! I know I shouldn 't do this , but ... sometimes a girl has to do what a girl has to do . - [ Laughing ] - A nooner ? It 's not even 11 : 00 . [ Phone Ringing ] What ? You gotta help me . There 's some pretty freaky things going on here . - Broots , where are you ? - I 'm stuck in your father 's bathroom . And there 's some things goin ' on here that shouldn 't be goin ' on in the workplace . What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm talking about Brigitte . [ Brigitte ] Oh , you 'd better go clean that up ... before it stains your pants , you know . Oh - Oh , l-I gotta go . Broots ? Broots ? [ Brigitte ] Hurry up . It 's kind ofhard to finish this without you . If your husband finds us in his office , we 'll both be finished . [ Sighs ] [ Car Doors Closing ] [ Jarod ] The reporter Bryce 's Mom mentioned is named Joshua Meyers . - So what 's the problem ? - The problem is ... the magazine he claims to write for doesn 't exist . [ Detective ] From the looks of this place , neither does his career . Meyers ? Oh , my God . [ Detective ] Whoever he is , this guy built a shrine to Bryce Banks . Our guy ? But where 's the boy ? [ Running Footsteps ] - [ Rifle Cocks ] - Get down ! Come out ! [ Yelling ] I thought you said the kidnapper was a big guy . This guy couldn 't be more than 5 ' 6 " . - Where 's the boy ? - Y - You 're too late . He 's my brother now . You have pictures of Bryce Banks all over your walls . - What have you done with him ? - His name 's Joshua . He 's my brother now . [ Man Screaming , Static ] [ Screaming , Static Stops ] So , little brother , tell me your name . My name is Joshua . My name is Joshua . [ Static ] [ Sam ] I 've been going over the case files ... - and I think there may be two kidnappers . - [ No Audible Dialogue ] Joshua Meyers . His real name is Theodore Reed . One of the kidnapped boys that the bureau never found . [ Detective ] How could that be possible ? - He grew up . - My name is Joshua . My name is Joshua . My name is Joshua . My name is Joshua . My name is Joshua ! [ Echoing ] [ Broots ] Well - [ Clears Throat ] I 've got good news , and I 've got bad news . The good news is Brigitte is a lot happier . And the bad news is it 's Mr. Lyle who 's making her that way . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about the horizontal bop . - Bridget and my brother ? - Broots , are you 100 % sure ? Oh , well , more like 80 , 82 . What ? Drugs and Lyle ? Unbelievable . [ Sighs ] This is gonna break my father 's heart . [ Jarod ] They 've been gone for a decade ... and now they kidnap other children . A human pyramid scheme . So the second kidnapper may be the other missing boy from 10 years ago . - Mike Taylor . - You said that he was a large man . He is . He also calls himself Joshua . And Bryce will also be named Joshua . A new name from a new parent . - A father figure . - And there 's our connection . They are my brothers . They areJoshua , like me . [ Jarod On Speaker ] Where have you taken the boy ? You 've told me everything else . Why not tell me where he was taken ? - He can 't say . - Joshua can 't say . He will takeJoshua into the woods . Joshua doesn 't wanna go into the woods . - Ask him about the woods . - What 's in the woods ? You two are scary . - Joshua can 't say . - Why can 't you say ? - Father . - [ Jarod ] Who is Father ? Is this you ? Your name isn 't Joshua . It 's Theodore . Theodore Reed . My name is Joshua . My name is Joshua . My name is Joshua . Joshua doesn 't wanna go into the woods . - Because of Father ? - Anything for Father . Everything for Father . Anything for Father . - Where is the boy ? - Everything for Father . - Where is the boy ? - Anything for Father . - Where is the boy ? - Everything for Father . Anything for Father . Everything for Father . Anything for Father . This isn 't someone who is lying . It 's not that he won 't tell us . He can 't . The way he shuts down when I ask him difficult questions - classic signs of psychological patterning . - Yes . Brainwashing . - As much as we 'd like to think ... some C.I.A. Spook perfected it during the Cold War ... these men aren 't a product of that . Well , they weren 't men when they were kidnapped . When a child is taken from his home ... he eventually loses all sense of what is real and unreal . Without that connection to the people that he loves ... without that nurturing , his mind can easily be molded . And his loyalty is changed , his intellect honed . His very identity so altered , he doesn 't even know who he is anymore . How do you know all of this ? They 're going to do to Bryce what was done to them . - Brainwash him ? - [ Jarod ] If the boy measures up . And if he doesn 't ? In 26 hours ... Bryce Banks could be gone forever . [ No Audible Dialogue ] - [ Man ] You 're running out of time . - Yeah , I know . - [ Man ] You 're running out of time . - Yeah , I know . Look , we need to try another tack in finding the connection ... between Bryce Banks and the other kidnapped boys . - Father figures . - We 're talking pastors , coaches , scout leaders . - That kind of thing . - Anyone they could look up to in place of their real father . We 're on it , Sam . So how 's Detective Doyle ? That 's one I haven 't figured out yet . [ Young Raines ] You did it , Jarod . You won . [ Young Jarod ] Does that mean I can see my mom and dad ? We 've already explained that to you . We 're your family now . Look how proud you 've made us here today . I almost feel like your father . [ Knocking ] - Sam . - Oh , hi . I hope I 'm not disturbing you . Uh , how did you find out where I was ? - Uh , Logan told me . - Oh . - May I ? - Oh , sure . Come in . - Thanks . No . - I 'm sorry . Well , this isn 't exactly where I had imagined a talented law enforcement officer would live . I 'm , uh , sort of in between places right now . - Yes . - Sorry about the mess . No . None of my business , really . - It 's a long story . - Oh . So , uh , what can I do for you ? Well , I was just , uh , curious about one thing . - What 's that ? - Why are you lying ? I felt there was something bothering you about this case ... and when I looked at the video of you questioning Joshua , I knew it . - I don 't understand . - A child . A child trapped by his past . Lost , alone , afraid . With all due respect , I don 't think that I 'm the one that you should be profiling . Well , I 'm sorry . It 's a bad habit of mine . - Who are you , Jarod ? - What do you mean ? [ Laughs ] Come on . You eat candy out of a toy dispenser . You have your whole life laid out around you . Classic textbook misplaced childhood , I guess . No , I don 't think there 's anything textbook about you . My life has no bearing on this case . Well , I think that it does . That interrogation - That interrogation went nowhere ... because Joshua Meyers was programmed to shut down . End of story . You know , my mother died when I was a little girl . And ... my father - My father just wasn 't really around . I was sort of raised by my best friend 's family . You had foster parents , didn 't you ? Foster parents ? I guess you could call them that . Why is this case so personal to you ? Let 's just say that I 'm ... dedicated . Or maybe you 're more like Joshua than you want to admit . [ Big Joshua ] I 've done everything as you instructed . I understand . Yes , sir . Your new son is almost ready . [ Beeps Off ] My name is Joshua . Father is gonna be so proud of you . [ Laughing ] No , Joshua , no ! No ! You disappoint me , Joshua ! Do you know what happens when Father rejects you ? You go out into the woods ... and you don 't come out , ever ! Ever . Ask all you want . I won 't tell you where the boy is . Whatever you say , Joshua . A son should be called by his given name ... especially if that name was given to him by Father . Gave you a new name , a whole new life . He loved you when your own father wouldn 't . But part of his love was doing his will ... and his will was to kidnap innocent children and take them from their homes . No . Bryce was unhappy . His father didn 't love him . His new father will - my father . Before you were ripped away from your real family , were you unhappy ? I wasn 't taken . I was set free . Father doesn 't make us do anything . We do things for Father . Of course . After all , he 's Father . You have to do whatever he says , obey his will . - Yes . - Even if he asked you to ... go into the woods ? Why are you so afraid of the woods , Joshua ? Is it because your brothers are out there ? - Brothers ? - Eight of you were taken ... but only two of you became Joshua . The rest died in the woods . Stop - Stop talking to me . What does your father make you do in the woods , Joshua ? Joshua-Joshua can 't say . Well , maybe these pictures will help you remember . - I don 't want to look . - What happened to this Joshua ? I don 't want to look . No , I don 't want - I don 't want to look . Father didn 't think he cut it ... so he asked you to go out in the woods and do this to him . He asked you to kill this boy , didn 't he ? Look at the pictures , damn it ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . - Theodore - - I 'm so sorry . - I 'm so sorry . - Theodore , help me . Help me save Bryce . [ Sobbing Continues ] I 'm sorry . [ Laughter ] Ah , angel . Ah , perfect timing . Daddy , I need to speak with you , alone . Well , this is your family . We , uh-We have no secrets . - Daddy , I 've recently learned - - Miss Parker ? Oh . Excuse me . May we have a word with you outside ? - Later . - It 's important . Excuse me . One minute . [ Door Opens ] - What ? - I checked the contents of that s - I checked the contents of the syringe . It was Pergonal . - What the hell is that ? - It 's a drug . But a fertility drug . Fertility ? Are you sure ? Bridget wasn 't trying to get high . She was trying to get pregnant . Oh . But with whose baby ? - [ Laughter ] - [ Brigitte ] So , Lyle and I came in here to celebrate . I know I shouldn 't , but I couldn 't help it . I was so excited ! Too excited . She spilled champagne all over my pants . I had to go into the bathroom and clean myself up . Angel , you wanted to tell me something . It 's nothing , Daddy . I 'm gonna get going . [ Mr. Parker ] No , wait . Wait . Wait a minute . We have something to tell you . Brigitte and I are going to have , uh , a little Parker . Congratulations , Miss P. You 're gonna have a baby brother or sister . [ Mr. Lyle ] Oh , this is fantastic ! [ Mr. Parker ] It turns out the erratic behavior and mood swings ... had to do with fertility drugs . You know , the hormones and what . This is a surprise . Yeah . Well , it 's a happy day for the family . Oh , come on . Don 't be a poop . Happy days , indeed . Go , go , go ! Go ! The woods . The woods ! [ Bryce ] Where are we going ? We 're going for a walk in the woods . Hello , Joshua . - Who are you ? - I 'm the Father . I 'm your father . Don 't be afraid . I 've come to set you free . - [ Detective ] Drop the knife ! - [ Guns Cocking ] - Drop the knife ! - No , You don 't understand . - No , you don 't understand . - I am the Father . He is my son . I am Abraham . - Come on , do this . - I 'm going to set - [ Sobbing ] No ! [ Yelling ] [ Grunting ] - No more - - Father . - Killing ! - All right , Jarod , we got him ! - No more ! No more ! Calm down , all right ? Jarod . No , no . Everything for Father . It 's okay . [ Panting ] - It 's okay . It 's okay . - [ Sobbing ] It 's okay now . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . [ Whispering ] Detective . We can 't thank you enough for giving us a second chance with our son . - How 's your husband ? - I don 't think he realizes the way he is . But I do know that I 'm gonna do everything I can ... to show our son that there 's more to life ... than winning chess matches . [ Murmuring ] His name is Dr. Samson Dane . He was a child psychologist . He treated Meyers , Taylor and the other missing boys . He used his influence to lure them away from their families . Dane 's own son died of a genetic disorder . My guess is his name was Joshua . All these years he was trying to recreate a family . They 're being admitted to a psychiatric facility . With any luck , they 'll be deprogrammed . - What about their parents ? - They 're seeing them today . Ten years is a long time . A child never forgets the people who love him . - Well , I - - Oh , wait . I almost forgot . - [ Chuckles ] - I got you this . For me ? Thank you . Uh ... - [ Laughs ] - For the kid in you . [ Chuckles ] - Good luck , Jarod . - Thank you . I 'll see you .

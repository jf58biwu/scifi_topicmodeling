( theme music playing ) Synced Corrected by Shadowmoon ( dog barks in distance ) WOMAN : All right , ladies and gentlemen , and that concludes tonight 's lecture . Any questions ? Sorry , the hallway 's closed . Oh , I just need to use the stairs . If you could just go back to the stairway you came from , that 'd be great . This way 's closer . My car 's parked ... Yeah , I know , but it 's not gonna kill you to take a few extra steps . So if you would please , I 'd really appreciate it . Thank you very much . What kind of a nut plants a bomb in a building full of kids ? I guess I 'll just wait for the bomb squad to show up . ( door opening ) ( students conversing ) Whoa . Everybody hold back . Just stay right where you are , would you ? Hold it , everyone . Go back , just go ... stop . What 's going on , man ? I gotta get home . I know . And I 'm sorry for the inconvenience , but ... Excuse me . No one can go in the hallway . Excuse me . So if you would just go back around the back stairwell . What 's the big deal ? Uh , it 's not safe . So what 's going on ? I 'm not sure , really . Some guy won 't let anyone through ... says the hallway 's not safe . Really ? If you won 't go home , would you at least please go back around the corner ? Come on , people . It 's very important ... This guy ... what does he look like ? That we clear the hallway immediately , right now ... Hmm , dark hair , average build , about six feet . And a face like apple pie ? Yeah , now that you mention it . Uh-huh . I know him . And if he says we should head back around the corner , we should definitely head back around the corner . Come on , Spike . Hey , listen to me , would ya ? Excuse me . Look , all right , if you won 't go home would you at least please go back around the corner ? See you later . Would you just go back ... would you just go back ? No , look , man . This is ridiculous . No one 's telling me I can 't go . No , I 'm telling you you can 't go . So just ... WOMAN : Excuse me Excuse me . What is going on here ? GARY : Dr. Price ? Yes . Can I talk to you ? Stay there . ( clears throat ) A bomb ? ! In my office ? ( stammers ) Well , I called the bomb squad , and they 're on their way . So it 's nothing to worry about . Just ... You saw it ? Huh ? You were in my office ? Well , no , I wasn 't in your office , no . Then how do you know it 's in there ? Well , that 's , that 's kinda hard to explain . You see , uh ... Try . Hey , if it 's so unsafe , how come he gets to be down there ? Listen ... STUDENT : Yeah , what 's up with my man ... ? Hey ! Don 't open that ! Hey ! ( grunting ) ( onlookers murmuring ) ( giggling ) ( people screaming ) ( alarm bell ringing ) ( all clamoring ) ( horn blaring , sirens wailing ) MARISSA : Are you sure you 're okay ? I mean , you don 't want someone to take a look at you ? No . My ear 's ringing a little bit , that 's it . Oh , gosh , Gary , I wish you 'd stop taking such risks , you know ? Oh , don 't . I 'm gonna be fine . Hey , does the paper say if the police have any idea who planted the bomb ? It says they 're following various leads . It doesn 't make sense . I mean , who would want to kill Dr. Price ? I don 't know . Apparently , she provides testimony for the D.A. ' s office in insanity cases . Oh , so someone 's holding a grudge . Do you know anything about this woman at all ? No . I mean , I 've had class with her for a few weeks now , but from the way she works with me , I can tell she 's ... STUDENT : Marissa , wait up . ( panting ) I 'm glad I caught up with you . Jeffrey . I 'm sorry . I 'm Jeffrey Craig . Gary . I 'm in Dr. Price 's class with Marissa . How you doing ? Glad to meet you . Man , you were really something back there . Right-time-right-place kinda deal . Yeah , well , I don 't know how you can be so calm . I mean , I was way down the hall , and I 'm still shaking . If you hadn 't been there , there 's no telling how many people ... Jeffrey , is there something that you wanted ? Yeah . Uh , well , to be honest , help ... with my grades . MARISSA : Oh . You seem to understand what we 're talking about in class . I just , I thought maybe if you weren 't too busy , we could get together and study sometime ? Sure . Um , would you mind if we studied at my place ? I mean , it 'd be easier , and , uh ... I 'm done with work tomorrow about 4 : 00 . So , after that , I 'm free . Is 7 : 00 too late ? 7 : 00 's fine . Don 't forget your books . You 'll be doing all the reading . Yes , ma 'am . All right , so I 'll see you tomorrow at 7 : 00 . Okay . Where do you live ? 3211 Chestnut . JEFFREY : All right . Uh , do you want me to bring a pizza or something ? Um , that 's okay . I think I can whip something up . All right . ( horn blares , dog barks in distance ) ( sighs , clears throat ) What are you looking at ? ( blues song playing ) A date , huh ? A study date . Mm . This guy definitely had more than studying on his mind , trust me . Mm-hmm . I mean , how well do you know this guy ? Did you talk to him before ? Sometimes before class , a little after class , and we sat next to each other , so it only stands to reason that ... I mean , what do you know about this guy ? I mean ... Well , I mean , he seems intelligent and ... and friendly and not in a pushy way . He 's got a nice voice . Mm ... nice voice . Oh , yes , he 's got a very nice voice . I 've heard it myself . Really ? And what does he look like ? Oh , he 's a nice-looking guy . A little squat , hunchback big ears , very large ears ... flapping around like Dumbo , like , you know ... Stop . ( cat meows ) " Dr. Price poisoned . Strychnine in salad dressing at lunchtime . " Not again . CHUCK : Why are we here ? I hated college . Deadlines , term papers , cram-study sessions . Huh ... Stupid touch-football games . Dorm food . Ugh ! Communal showers . Toilets with no doors . Waking up in the middle of the night drunk in the parking lot , naked . I remember that . You know what ? Since we have graduated , I do not even remotely miss anything about college . I stand corrected . You know what , Gare ? Huh ? Uh , you 've got a lot of work to do , and I , I 'd just be getting into your hair . So I tell you what . Why don 't we meet back here in , say , what , 40 minute ... no . Meet me at the cafeteria , 40 minutes . I 'll buy you lunch . All right . All right ? Yeah . All right . I 'll , I 'll meet ya . Yeah . I 'll meet ya . All right . ( bell tolling ) ( indistinct conversations ) I wouldn 't do that . What do you think you 're ... ? Wait a minute . I remember you . You disappeared before I had a chance to talk to you last night . Well , sorry about that . I had things to do . And today ? More things to do ? Something like that . Would you like to tell me about it ? Somebody laced your salad dressing with strychnine . That 's pretty much it . I was almost killed last night . Oh , yes , I know . But still you thought that I might enjoy your macabre sense of humor today . This is not humor . Give me that bottle . I 'm going to have the contents tested . You do realize , of course , that if there is strychnine in there , you 're going to have some explaining to do . Well , there 's not much more I can tell you , so ... I do not like having my life threatened . I 'm going to find out what 's going on . Lady , I hope you do . Hey , Gare . Gare . Whoa ! How 'd it go ? Huh ? It went fine . Done already , huh ? Yeah . How 'd everything go with you ? Oh , well , my friend , it went better than fine . Whoa ! Good . That 's good , that 's ... What are you doing ? Help me up . ( camera shutter clicking ) ANSWERING MACHINE : 5 : 32 p.m. Oh , gotta get started . ( upbeat RB playing ) Good boy . So you think you can keep yourself entertained while I get dressed ? ( barks ) Okay . ( buzzer sounds ) Um , who is it ? It 's Jeffrey Craig . Have books , will travel . And I also have this . Hmm , ' 89 . Very good year . You can actually feel that ? No , but the reaction 's always worth it when I get it right . ( laughs ) Man , it smells good up in here . Oh , um , old family recipe . Nothing special . But I thought maybe we 'd eat before we hit the books . And she cooks , too . JEFFREY : " In one of the most extreme statements " " of environmental determinism , John B. Watson , " " the founder of Behaviorism , said , " 'Give me a dozen healthy infants , well-formed , 'and my own specified world to bring them up in ... 'and I 'll guarantee to take any one at random " and train him to become any type of specialist I might select . ' " This guy 's joking , right ? He can 't be saying we all become who we are because of where we are . Well , pretty much . I mean , behaviorists believe that our environment controls almost all aspects of our behavior . Okay . Two brothers ... go to the same school , eat the same food , grow up in the same house . Right . When they get a little older , one of them pulls a string of stupid stunts . Spends ten years bouncing in and out of jail . The other doesn 't . He knows there 's a better way . How do you explain that ? It 's the same environment , totally different outcomes . I don 't know , Jeffrey . ( chuckles ) See , that 's the kind of stuff that got me interested in psychology . What got you interested ? My grandmother , I think . She , um , taught me that we can sometimes help by just being good listeners . Hmm . My friends , uh , Gary and Chuck , they say I 'm a natural counselor . Have you known Gary a long time ? A couple years . Hey , why don 't I , um , get us some more coffee , huh ? Nah , it 's late . I should get going . Oh , you don 't have to get up . I can show myself out . It 's okay . Well ... Hey , thanks for everything . Sure . I hope we can get together again sometime . Um , me , too . I 'd like that . Night . Good night . CHUCK : Then what ? Then , then he left . Come on . Come on , Chuck . It was a study date . Oh , so the dude shows up with a bottle of wine for a study date . Yeah . MARISSA : He was just being polite . He 's well-bred . He was just being a nice guy . Oh , sure , whatever you say . So what about you and this girl on campus ? As a matter of fact , we have a study date this afternoon . Oh . And I don 't mind telling either of you that there happens to be a mutual attraction between the two of us . ( phone rings ) Well , good for you , Chuck . Hobson 's residence . Give me that . Hold on , please . Hello . Yeah , this is him . Sure , I can do that . Okay . Bye . Here . What was that about ? That was your Dr. Price . She wants to meet me after school tonight . Did she say why ? Isn 't it obvious ? No . No . Gary saved her life ... twice . He 's her hero , her knight in shining armor . Trust me . Love is in the air . CHUCK : Hmm ... A bird splattered on a window . Let 's try another one . Wouldn 't this be easier if we weren 't sitting in different zip codes ? I know . Rules . I have a very good feeling about you , Chuck . I think it 's time we move on to the next level . My sentiments exactly . Good . How about dinner ? Excuse me ? You know , a social ritual taken on by members of the opposite sex , often referred to as a date . Actually , I was thinking more along the lines of the PMME Index . Do they have a nice wine list ? It 's just that my work here is so important to me , and you have done so well . I just wouldn 't want to complicate things . Oh , no , I , I wouldn 't want to do that either . I 'm sure you can understand that , a man of your sensitivity ? Oh , absolutely . So , shall we ? Fire away . Question one : At what age did you have your first sexual experience ? Hmm ... ( knocking ) Dr. Price . Gary , come in . ( clears throat ) I see you 've , uh , you moved . Well , I couldn 't very well work in my office , could I ? ( chuckles ) Please , sit down . As you can probably imagine , the , uh ... stress of the past couple days has weighed heavily on my mind . Yes , I can imagine . It 's only since this morning that I was able to depersonalize what 's been happening and look at things with a clinical eye . That , that 's a good thing ? Yes , it is . And that led to my asking you here . Like I said , I think I 've told you pretty much everything . I am a psychologist . Therefore , I view everything that 's said here as strictly confidential . But you have to trust me , trust that I can help . I 've had extensive experience working with people very much like yourself . You 're a troubled man , Gary , but I think I can help . I think that we can work through this together without further police involvement . What police ? There have been no breaks in the case . I think we both know why . We do ? Laced with strychnine , just as you said . When did you do it ? While it was in the fridge in the psych department ? You ... You don 't think that ... ? Me ? You knew about the bomb , you knew about the dressing . It 's textbook . You know , I once counseled a firefighter who deliberately set blazes . Listen , what I got you can 't find in any textbook . I mean ... Listen , I want you to think about this carefully . As I said to you yesterday , I won 't tolerate having my life threatened . You can either cooperate with me or I will file charges . Now wait a second , Doc . No . No , no . See , I 'm not your problem . I didn 't , I didn 't put poison in your , in your salad dressing , and I didn 't plant any bomb . I mean , I don 't ... ( footsteps running ) ( door opens ) Did you hear that ? What ? ANSWERING MACHINE : You have no messages . Would it have hurt him to call and say thanks for the spaghetti ? ( doorbell buzzes ) Who is it ? Jeffrey Craig . I hope I 'm not bothering you . Oh , no . Come on in . Well , I shouldn 't . It 's late . I just wanted to say thanks . I had a nice time . Oh . Well , you 're welcome , but , um ... you didn 't have to come all the way over here to say that . No , I ... Well , there 's something I wanted to give you . Really ? What is it ? This . ( sighs ) Thank you . I 'm telling you . A couple of hours with Jensen yesterday , and my eyes have been opened . It finally dawned on me what all the women that I have dated in the past have been lacking . Taste . Funny . You feel better now ? You got that out of your system ? A little bit . No , I was referring to maturity . They have no , no depth . They can 't see beyond the trappings of life ... the baubles . The baubles ? Yeah , you know , like , " What restaurant are we going to ? " " What kind of car do you drive ? What kind of life insurance policy do you carry ? " See , Jensen is not like that . She 's completely different . Do you know , we sat for two hours yesterday just talking ? Hmm . Talking ! And you know what we talked about ? Hmm ? Me , Chuck Fishman . Ah . And not the superficial stuff either . Deep , meaningful things that have ... What are you doing ? Huh ? I 'm tying my shoe . I 'm going to meet Marissa and Jeffrey for lunch . I am trying to tell you a story here . Yeah ? Oh , well , I thought this was an assignment for class . Yeah , it started out as an assignment for class , but obviously it has evolved . Evolved . Into something much deeper . Matter of fact , she told me that today we 're gonna go to the next level . The next level ? Yeah . Just thinking about it , my , my skin , it gets all tingly . Still , growing up , you know , where I did , seeing what went on , you know , I ... I just get to a place where it takes a lot to scare you . ( blues music playing ) Tough guy , huh ? Yeah , that 's what I thought until I tried coming back to school . ( laughs ) I thought I was the only one . I was petrified of going back to school . You ? Absolutely terrified . I mean , you wouldn 't believe the excuses that I came up with . Well , I think you and I better stick together . I guess so . Hey , I 'm back . Look out , Spike . You know , I gotta get out of here . Hey , I 'm glad you could join us . Yeah , it was good to see you again . Yeah . And you ... I 'll talk to you later . Take care . Hey , buddy . I like him . He seems nice enough . Did he have to kiss your hand ? Now , what 's that ? I really like him , Gary . I mean , I don 't know how I 'm supposed to act , or I don 't remember what I 'm supposed to do . Seems to me like you 're doing just fine . You 're my friend . You have to say that . No , I don 't have to say that . Look , you know what 's going on . You ... You talk to him , and you be honest . Okay ... I 'll think about it . You know , this isn 't exactly what I pictured when you said that it was time to take our relationship to the next level . Well , you 're the only one of my subjects who made it to phase three of the experiment . I knew there was something special about you . What about dinner ? Soon as we 're through with the session . Deal ? Deal . Okay , now I 'm going to ask you a series of multiple-choice questions . Depending on your answer , you 're either going to , A : Feel nothing at all or you 're going to feel a small correction . Sure , whatever you say . You like Italian food ? Understand that you 're free to leave whenever you want . I know this great new place just opened downtown . Friend of mine runs it . You ready ? Fire away . You 're at a stop light . In the car next to you , an attractive woman looks at you and smiles . This means , A ) She finds you attractive . B ) She 's admiring your car , or C ) She just heard something funny on the radio ? A ) She finds me attractive . ( bell rings ) Ah ! B ) She 's admiring my car . ( bell rings ) Easy on the juice . Interesting . You 're shopping in a department store . A saleswoman laughs at all your jokes . This means , A ) All your jokes are funny . B ) She finds you attractive . C ) She 's just trying to earn a healthy commission . B. ( bell dings ) I mean A ? ! ( bell dings ) ( gasping ) B ! ( bell dings ) My arm hairs are burning ! ( sighs ) Okay , I can do this . ( knocking ) Marissa . Hi . Did I forget something ? Were we supposed to study ? No . 'Cause you 've got your books with you ... Oh . Um , Braille library . May I come in for a minute ? I 'm sorry . Yeah , sure . Come on in . Come on in . Okay . Can I , uh ... get you anything to drink ? Is something wrong ? No , no . Just taking it all in . I like it . Lamp over here . Furniture here . That 's a chair . I 'm actually doing some renovations for the landlord , just for some extra bucks . The place is kind of a mess . Nice . Contemporary . What color is it ? The chair ? Green . I think . I 'm color-blind . Oh . How do you like that ? Something else we have in common . So what does bring you here ? A glass of water . Hmm ? You asked me if I wanted something to drink . One glass of water coming up . Great . I thought maybe we could , um , could talk . About what ? Class ? Um , no . Ah , I don 't know . Uh ... I mean , um , I thought we could talk about us . There you go . One glass of water . Thank you . So ... us , huh ? Look , I 'm sorry if I 'm making a big deal out of something I shouldn 't , but , um ... What ? Um ... I get this feeling . What is it ? It 's like , um , the more time I spend with you , the more time I want to spend with you . Is that a good thing ? I don 't know . That depends on you . Anything else I can clear up ? No , that 'll be fine . Um , but it is getting late , and , uh , I should be going . You sure ? Yeah . Let me get my books . Pictures ? It 's a hobby of mine . Photography . Oh . What do you shoot ? Landscapes , mostly . I bet they 're beautiful . You need any help ? Um , no , I 'm okay . Let me call you a cab . Oh , no , that 's okay . I 'm fine . Thank you . ( Spike whines ) I 'm sorry for coming by without calling . Well , I 'm glad you did . Me , too . I guess I 'll see you tomorrow . Good night . Good night . Bye , Spike . ( blues song playing ) ( indistinct conversations ) Mr. Hobson . Oh , not again . I just need a minute . What is it ? Another theory about me ? Or are you still waiting for a confession ? No . I 've just been to the police . I spoke to a Detective Crumb , who told me I should trust you . And do you ? No . But , frankly , I have no choice . I 've been through all the files of all the cases I 've testified on , and I 'm at a dead end . So , will you help me ? Ah ... Please ? ( bell tolling ) ( indistinct conversations ) Marissa . Hey , Chuck . Hey . Beautiful day , isn 't it ? Not really . What 's wrong with you ? You seem different . Well , I feel different . I feel great , actually . You know , Chuck , I think I 'm in ... Don 't say it . Why ? Love hurts , that 's why . You got burned ? I got burned ? I have minor skin irritation . How could you tell ? It was a figure of speech , Chuck . That means she dumped you . Listen , sister , if anybody dumped anybody , it was me dumping her , you understand ? Okay . Okay . But I thought you were ... Just don 't get me started . She treated me like Pavlov 's dog . She had me salivating to take her out on a date , when I don 't think she ever really wanted to go out with me in the first place . You know what ? It 's too late now , anyway . She missed her chance . Let her ring somebody else 's bell . We are through . Guess you told her , huh ? Damn straight . Psych majors , they 're all crazy ! Present company excluded , of course . Of course . Listen , I have to , uh , go meet Jeffrey now , so I 'll see you later . Whoa , whoa , wait a minute . Wait a minute . What are these ? Oh , uh , they 're pictures I picked up by mistake when I was at Jeffrey 's house . I 'm gonna return ' em to him now . Really ? Yeah . A little strange , don 't you think ? Strange ? What 's strange ? Well , what is he , some kind of voyeur or something ? What are you talking about , Chuck ? Do you know what these are pictures of ? Yeah , they 're landscape pictures . No , they 're not . There 's pictures of Gary a-and me and ... some woman . A little bizarre . Hey . I was starting to think I was in the wrong place . Oh , sorry . I guess I lost track of time . Is something wrong ? No . Everything 's fine . Maybe we should forget about studying tonight . I mean , everything 's closed up . You look kind of tired . We can always get together . I found these in my book . ( sighs ) There 's no harm done . Isn 't my best work anyway . Um , did you show them to anyone ? I wanted to , to , uh ... get an objective opinion ... see if you 're any good . But I couldn 't find anyone . All right . All right . Let 's sit . Can you describe them to me ? Uh ... yeah , sure . ( sighs ) Well , um ... uh ... there 's one of the Wrigley Building and , um ... well , it 's kind of blurry ' cause I used a slow-speed shutter and I didn 't have a tripod . And , uh ... this one is of the sun rising over Lake Michigan . The water 's reflecting the sky , like a mirror , and there 's a little sun flare in the lens . And the last one is lightning . It looks ... alive and magical and dangerous all at the same time . Sounds nice . You 're right , though . I am tired . I gotta go . Come on , Spike . I can 't let you do that . You 'll just run to Gary . Come on , Spike . There 's nowhere you can go , Marissa . ( Spike whimpering ) ( barking ) Spike , come . ( barking ) PRICE : What exactly are you looking for ? Somebody I might have seen ... on campus , in your office , the cafeteria . Well , you 've looked at everyone now . Everyone I 've ever testified against who 's either been paroled or released . Recognize anyone ? What 's in that box up there ? Oh . Those are the ones who are still behind bars . You mind if I take a look at that ? Be my guest . But you 're wasting your time . And mine . Why do you have those pictures ? Can 't we talk about this ? You planted the bomb , didn 't you ? And the pictures . Oh , my God . I can explain . You did ! You did ! Enough . Wait a second . Who is this ? Hmm ? GARY : Who is this ? He died in prison three weeks ago , murdered by another inmate . No , no , no . Him . Oh , my God . That 's his brother . He 's in one of my classes . Why didn 't I see it ? I 'm calling the police . Marissa . Where are you going ? The auditorium . I didn 't mean for any of this to happen . Please go away , Jeffrey . I do care about you , Marissa . It 's just that ... things have gotten a little complicated . Complicated ? You used me , Jeffrey . No , not entirely . See , I ... I had to . It doesn 't mean that I was ... I don 't know . I don 't know . All right then , Jeffrey ... If you care for me , please let me go . I can 't . Not until I finish what I started . I 'm sorry , Marissa . ( light switch clicks ) ( projector clicks ) Let there be light . Marissa ? Be careful , Gary , he 's here . GARY : Where ? I don 't know , Gary . Can 't you see him ? Can you see him ? Jeffrey , I know what this is about . It 's about your brother , Bobby . I know he died in prison . That wasn 't Dr. Price 's fault . Look , Jeffrey , it 's not her fault , you know that . Don 't you ? It wasn 't yours , either . You need to know that . Jeffrey , what you 're doing ... it 's not going to help anyone . You gotta believe me . Let us help you , please . Two brothers . They go to the same school . They eat the same food . They grow up in the same house . How do you explain that ? I don 't know , Jeffrey . But you can 't keep paying for his mistake . ( projector clicks ) ( knife clattering ) MAN : Right in here , officers . POLICEMAN : Hold it right there . JEFFREY : I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Marissa . ( door closes ) ( clearing throat ) You , uh , want some company ? Sure . Not a lot of laughs , though . That 's all right . I 'll just , uh ... I 'll just sit down here with you . What 's the view like ? The view ? It 's , uh ... It 's big . A lot of lights ... Towers ... The El sort of weaves through it like a ribbon . Funny how you can feel alone among all those people . You 're not alone . I 'm not sorry either . I mean , you can 't be sorry for your feelings , even if it turns out to be wrong , can you ? No . CHUCK : What are you guys doing ? Having a party ? Where have you been ? Where have I been ? I 've been reading about myself in her senior thesis . It 's all over campus . What 's the title ? Tell her . ( clears throat ) " The Self-Deception in the American Male . " ( Marissa laughing ) You find that amusing ? A little . Let 's go . Where are we going ? To celebrate . Celebrate what ? Friendship ... and the ... the fact that if it hadn 't been for you two in the last year or so ... that I , uh ... well , I ... I wouldn 't have , uh ... Thank you is what I 'm trying to say . You 're welcome . CHUCK : Can we go to the racetrack ? GARY : No . ( cat meows ) CHUCK : How about we buy some lottery tickets ? Why don 't you tell me what the Cubs are gonna do ? No , I 'm not going to tell you anything . Oh , come on , Gary . The market 's bad ... Go away . CHUCK : So , there you have it . When you think about it , what more can anyone ask ? A couple of friends you can count on , a place to rest your head , ( meowing ) and every morning ... the future waiting just outside your door . Life is good , my friends . Trust me . Life is good . ( cat meows )

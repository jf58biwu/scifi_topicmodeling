( MAN SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) WOMAN 2 : Oh ! It 's an Eeno . WOMAN 3 : Eeno . ( GIRL SHOUTING IN TENCTONESE ) Eeno ! Filthy Eeno . Get away from us . Just get away from us . ( GASPS , PANTING ) Get off me , you filthy Eeno . ( HORN HONKING ) Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Call 911 ! Call 911 ! Do something ! Get some help , for God 's sake ! You 'll be all-It 'll be all right . I 'm so sorry . Don 't stand there . Call 911 ! WOMAN 4 : What 's her problem ? It 's only a Eeno . Oh , God . Don 't-Don 't try to move . It 'll be all right . It 'll be ... ( GASPS ) My God . My God . What 's the matter with you people ? She 's dead ! She 's-She 's dead ! Why-Why didn 't you help her ? God . Why didn 't you help her ? Why didn 't you help her ? Why ? MAN : That was the scene in California 's Mojave Desert eight years ago our historic first view of the Newcomer ship . Theirs was a slave ship carrying a quarter of a million beings ... bred to adapt , evolve and labor in any environment . These Newcomers are physically stronger than human beings ... with keener senses and two hearts . With no way to leave Earth , the Tenctonese Newcomers ... have become the latest addition to the population of Los Angeles . It 's not too bad . You 're lucky you didn 't get salt water in your eyes . Well , if we weren 't so underfunded and understaffed ... I could have called for human backup . So tell me , Morris . She , uh , starting to kick yet ? ( CHUCKLES ) I think she 's doing cartwheels . How long has it been since the pod transfer ? Five weeks ? Just three . Really ? Oh , well , you 're so big . Hey , Morris , George . What happened ? Oh , George walked into a 594 . Perp pulled a squirt gun and shot him with salt water . Ow . Do you know what I miss most about being pregnant ? It 's that special appreciation you suddenly feel for your body . You never look at your genitalia in the same way . I really don 't wanna think about it , George . Yes . What once was just an object of sexual gratification ... now supports and nourishes new life . Yeah . ( GROANS ) Wonderful . Oh . I have a few paternity shirts left over from my last pregnancy . I 'll bring them by tomorrow . Beats me , George . You guys got all this advanced technology ... you still can 't figure a way around pregnancy . What do you mean ? Well , after the woman pops the pod out ... why don 't you just cook the kid in a test tube the rest of the way ? And deprive ourselves of life 's greatest pleasures ? You know , Matt , sometimes I don 't understand you . Decorating your desk ? No , it 's for Cathy . She 's movin ' in today . Cathy 's moving into your apartment ? Mm-hmm . So what ? Well , normally the male moves into the female 's chuchlach-nest . Welcome to Earth , George . It 's either my chuchlach or no chuchlach . You couldn 't find her one with a few more leaves ? It had plenty of leaves . I just forgot it in my trunk for a few days . This should fix it up . George ! George , Albert and I need to talk to you . We have decided to have a child . Oh ! Oh , that 's wonderful . Seeing Morris Code pregnant . It made him realize how much he wants a baby . I know binnaums don 't usually choose to parent ... but I feel it would bring us so much closer . Of course . We want you to serve as gannaum and fertilize May . Me ? Yes . Oh , Albert , May . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What ? You fertilize May ? Well , as a binnaum , Albert is physiologically incapable of fertilizing May . He can only catalyze her . In order to conceive , she needs a gannaum . Albert was binnaum for your children ... and you will be gannaum for ours . It 's so beautiful . Oh , Albert , May . It 's a great honor . Thank you . Oh , boy . Three to tango . Albert . I 'll need a new robe for the ceremony . You know , studly , uh , you might wanna run this past the misses first . Why ? Well , most wives aren 't particularly thrilled ... when their hubbies have sex with other women . Well , we may be on Earth , but we are Tenctonese . We 're not given to petty human jealousy . Susan will be elated ... as proud as a teapot . " Peacock . " And I doubt it . Sikes , Francisco , sorry to intrude on your morning reverie . This 245 just came in . Hey , Bri , when are we gonna get those new computers ? We sent in the requisition six months ago . Sikes , in case you haven 't noticed , this department 's broke . And besides , little boys have to earn their toys . Hey , little man . How are you ... ( GRUNTS ) ( BOY LAUGHING ) Get to work . ( CHUCKLES ) GEORGE : Human witnesses report that the victim 's pleas for help ... were ignored by Newcomer bystanders . Strange . Sounds like LA To me . Well , I just meant that by and large , Newcomers tend to be good " Samericans . " " Samaritans . " Oh , that too . She looks about 16 . No ID . An Eeno . A what ? I don 't want to have anything to do with this . What are you talking about ? It 's a waste of time . Eenos . They have no respect for life . They are dechoch-savages . Eenos ? What 's an Eeno ? Just take it from me . These creatures are not worth a second of our time . Creatures ? Is this my partner talking ? Defender of the oppressed ? If I said something like that , you 'd be stomping me with your self-right . I don 't wanna get into this with you . They shouldn 't even be out on the street . No Tenctonese should have to look at an Eeno . George , she is Tenctonese . Oh , hardly . Just look at those spots . Well , they 're practically gray , and so ill-defined . You 're kidding , right ? Well , I don 't expect you to understand . To humans , we all look alike . But we are not . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Listen . I don 't know what bug flew up your colon , but we 're cops , George . And that girl , whatever you wanna call her , is dead . We 're gonna find out why . May I bring you something to drink ? A glass of chardonnay for me . What sour milks do you have by the glass ? Our house California Guernsey or a very nice Wisconsin Jersey . I 'll have the Jersey . Our specials today for humans , a fresh Dover sole lightly sautéed in a meunière sauce . And for Newcomers , we have ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) Faux tournedos of beef made from pressed eggplant . Sour milk ? For lunch ? I need a drink . Can 't be a bad hair day , so what is it ? I 'm not getting the senior vice presidency . Rosa is . And she should . She 's got great ideas ... better than mine . Rosa was just in the right place at the right time . And come on . You promised you were gonna stop with all this negative self-image buchois . It 's not ... " buchois . " ( SIGHS ) I just feel like ... What 's the expression ? An old screw . Shoe . Whatever . Even my husband 's bored with me . George ? You mean you two aren 't ... Oh , we 're having sex , if you can call it that . It 's just ... so dull and unimaginative . George seems to have forgotten that there 's more to lovemaking than the zechcha position . The what ? It 's-It 's our equivalent to your , um , masonry position . Except of course , the male has his right ankle under the female 's chin . ( EXHALES ) Of course . And then he 's asleep two minutes after we 're done . I 'm obviously not attractive to him anymore . Here you are , ladies . Susan , you 're an alarmist . So your sex isn 't setting off the smoke detector . It 's not like George is playing around or anything . Playing around ? Uh , I 'm sure he wouldn 't . Girl , you 're gonna have to pull yourself out of this funk . You are a talented , beautiful female . You 're worrying for nothing . MAN : And , uh , you 'll get that final report within an hour .. Hi , Cathy . Thanks for coming . Oh , this is gonna put me behind . I don 't know if I can get all my things moved into your place tonight . That 's okay . Ah . Matt , George , this is my assistant , Daniel . Hi . Hi . Yeah , the regular ME booked . Gave me some crap about some personal emergency . Oh . Seems my Newcomer colleagues are a little hinky about this case . The victim is an Eeno . Oh . I 'm sorry you had to be subjected to this . That 's all right . You know , George ... I 'm starting to think that under that alien skin there beats the two hearts of a bigot . That 's ridiculous . ( SCOFFS ) " Eenos are savages " ? " No one should have to look at an Eeno " ? Doesn 't that sound like bigotry to you ? Matt , bigotry is an unfounded , irrational bias . Any negative feeling I have toward Eenos comes from direct experience . Oh , yeah ? What kind of direct experience ? Maybe we should just get on with the autopsy . No , no , no , no . I-I wanna hear about this direct experience . What ? One of those Eenos came over to clean the pool and left some leaves in the drain ? We 're wasting time . Let 's get this over with . Like I said ... bigot . ( MOTOR WHIRRING ) The deceased was shot with a tranquilizing dart ... but the cause of death was most likely trauma from the impact of the car . I 'll have to take a tissue sample . Did you know she was pregnant ? No . About nine weeks . She was very close to vedoch . That 's the transference of the pod to the male . All right , let 's set up . I 'll start the internal exam now . ( CHATTERING ) ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) They didn 't really have a choice . Their failure put us all at risk . Yes . But do we have to do ... this ? As an example to the others . ( GROWLING ) ( GROWLING CONTINUES ) ( BOTH GROANING ) ( GROWLING , HISSING ) Following the standard postmortem procedure for a pregnant Newcomer female ... I 'm going to make a Bonhoeffer-modified " Y " incision . The template , please . Tissue necrosis consistent with sudden trauma . Droonal flange engorged as expected . I 'm incising the uterus now . Atypical odor inconsistent with this state of decomposition ... ( GASPING ) Daniel ? ( COUGHING ) Daniel ? ( GASPING , COUGHING CONTINUE ) Daniel . ( CHATTERING ) Matt , stay back . Keep everybody back . George , seal the door . What happened ? He 's dead . The fumes , clearly lethal to humans ... whatever they are ... came from her amniotic fluid . Have you ever seen anything like this before ? Never . Eenos . Doesn 't surprise me . George , it couldn 't have anything to do with that . With what ? Come on , guys . Let me in on this . This is a police investigation . What 's the story with these Eenos ? Cathy ? On the ship they performed the lowest tasks . They were responsible for disposing of all the refuse ... garbage , bodily wastes , biological hazards , corpses . Yeah ? So ? They had to feed themselves from the waste . Sometimes when there was nothing else , they were forced to eat the dead . They were cannibals , Matt . Cannibals . That 's why you 've never heard of the Eenos . They 're our shame . Well , okay . They were slaves , weren 't they ? They didn 't exactly have a lot of choice . Sometimes death is the preferable choice . I 'll be sure and remember that , Your Holiness . I don 't care what she had for breakfast . She still shouldn 't be lethal , should she ? No . I 'll have to arrange special precautions to continue the autopsy . GEORGE : Buck , dinner ! Can I have a glass of sour milk ? You are too young for milk . Have a beer , honey . Beer 's for little kids . Oh , Emily , we need to get you excused from school for father-daughter day . Remind me to write you a note . How was the job interview ? About 500 guys showed up . I didn 't fill out an application . ( SIGHS ) If you don 't fill out an application , Buck , you won 't even have a chance . Mom , you really think I wanna stuff tacos for a living ? Well , what do you want to do ? I don 't know . Be an architect or record producer . An architect or a record producer ? Can we talk about something else ? Well , actually , I have an announcement to make . Albert and May have decided to have a baby . Cool . Really ? I didn 't think binnaums had babies . Since they are catalyzers for procreation ... they have traditionally led monastic lives . But new planet , new customs . All Albert needs is a gannaum to fertilize May . And since Albert catalyzed you ... guess which gannaum they have asked to fertilize May . Dad ? You ? ( CHUCKLES ) Wow . That 's great ! George , wait . You 're gonna have sex with May ? No duh , Mom . How else ? Why didn 't they ask me ? I mean , I 'm young and my aklafluid 's got a much higher count . Your aklafluid hasn 't helped you get a job . George , you 're not serious about this . Course I am . And you didn 't think to consult me ? No . Why ? Well , in order to fertilize May , you 're gonna have to conserve your aklafluid ... which means you won 't be able to have sex with me for a month . Well , I-I realize that it is a-a sacrifice . Well , now that you 've brought it up ... the kind of sex we 've been having lately , I 'll probably not even notice a difference . What do you mean , Mom ? All we ever do is the zechcha position . That 's all ? Not even putlach ? Oh , putlach is too rough on my shins . Besides , we get to bed so late , I 'm ... tired . Well , you won 't have to worry about that now , will you ? You 've found the perfect excuse to skip the whole thing . Susan , I don 't understand . I thought you 'd be delighted . Really ? My husband says he 's not gonna have sex with me for a month ... so he can copulate with another female ... and I 'm supposed to be delighted . You sound like a jealous human woman . Dad ... It 's okay , Buck . I obviously don 't meet your father 's sexual needs . Maybe somebody else can . ♪ ( JAZZ POP ) ♪ Well , that 's the last of 'em . Oh , thanks . I-I put your cups in the back of the cupboard . Mine weren 't so cracked and chipped . I-I hope that 's okay . Oh , sure . Good idea . Oh , you already have one of these . Well , I-I guess I can just give mine to the Salvation Navy . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay . You know , this is was the first thing I bought for myself when I got my own apartment . So , look at us . Here we are ... ( INHALES ) living together . ( CHUCKLES ) Livin ' together . Well , why don 't we celebrate ? I got the perfect drink for the mixed-species couple : Sparkling cider . What 's this ? Oh , th-that 's the sponge for my droonal flange . It works much better when it 's cold . Ah . Ah . Y-You know , that Eeno girl ... I , um , sent out her amniotic fluid to be analyzed ... and the Bureau for Newcomer Affairs is doing a tissue ID . So w-we should be able to finish that autopsy tomorrow . Good . Here . Cathy , about the , uh , droonal flange sponge , uh ... That 's no big deal . I can get used to that . Really . MATT : How 'd the news go over ? You 'll have to be a little more specific . ( LAUGHING ) Come on ! Surrogate George , the sex machine ? What 'd Susan say ? Well , I hate to disappoint you , Matthew , but she was very pleased . That so ? Yes . " Very pleased " ? Yes . ( AIR BLOWING ) Pelvic cavity 's now fully exposed . I 'm removing the fetal pod . Janice , let me have a tray . Oh , I love this . I 'm making an incision into the anterior sheath of the fetal pod . Retractors . I 'm separating the pod walls . The fetus is now visible . Oh , boy . ( GROANS ) It 's deformed . Oh , yeah . Look-Look at that thing down its back . The exoskeleton . That 's normal for this stage of development . What ? That thing looks like a big bug . The Tenctonese fetus progresses through several stages of evolutionary development . Not unlike the human fetus , which at five weeks resembles a ... salamander . This is the deformity ... the abdomen . It 's three times the normal size . He announced this at the dinner table ? No sex , another woman ... Just like that ? You 're not gonna let him get away with this , are you ? Well , what can I do ? It 's his decision . There you go with that victim-slave mentality again . Do you want to save this marriage ? ( SCOFFS ) Of course I do . Let 's look at your options then . You could try seducing him . Remind George of why he married you in the first place . Or ... get even . Get even ? Make George jealous . Get yourself a taste of that . Jessica ... Why not ? Let George know how it feels . Besides , Rick likes you . Oh , come on . Rick Shaw ? I 'm an old , married female . I 've seen the way he looks at you . Believe me , he 'd love to get his hands on your spots . SUSAN : Oh , will you be quiet ? He 's a Newcomer . He 'll hear you . Good ! ( SCOFFS ) I could never do something like that . Okay , then . Go invest in some French underwear . ( EXHALES ) Come on , George . I 'll buy you a doughnut . Autopsies make me hungry . I thought they made you sick . They do . But after I get sick , I get hungry . Hey , Alberto ! May , a Danish for me and a doughnut for my partner . Jelly weasel ? Glazed marmot ? Hi , George . Albert . Just coffee with Dijon . Comin ' right up . I 'll bet Susan was surprised when you told her about us . Yes , she was . Very surprised . Oh , I wish I could 've seen the look on her face . So did you and Susan decide on a date yet ? Well , we 're still looking at our calendar . Oh , Sikes , good . Uh , this came in from the BNA , tissue ID on that dead Newc girl . Her name is Gayle Warnings ... age 16 , no next of kin . Captain , I hope you 'll be there when George impregnates May . What ? Oh , it just wouldn 't be the same without you . My sentiments exactly . Right . ( CHUCKLES ) Still lookin ' at the calendar , huh ? That a complicated deal over at your house ? Coffee needs a little more mustard . We got the analysis of that Eeno 's amniotic fluid . Her name was Gayle Warnings . All right . Miss Warnings 's amniotic fluid ... had a very high concentration of hydrofluoric acid . That 's a byproduct of gasoline production . Now , hydrofluoric acid would explain the fumes . It gives off a fluorine gas that is highly toxic to humans . How could she have been exposed to hydrofluoric acid ? Eenos have been known to find employment on Earth doing jobs not particularly desirable , toxic waste cleanup , for instance . You mean the only jobs they could get were the ones nobody else would take . You think that she could 've gotten this contaminated from just mopping up spills ? No , not at these levels . She must 've been deliberately injected . ( GASPS ) ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) She is our salvation . We won 't be outcasts anymore . Those who oppressed us , who continue to oppress us ... will fall on their knees before us . ( SIGHS ) ( KEYS CLATTER ) Cathy ! I 'm ... home . Hi . I spent all day long putting everything together , so I had to take a shower . So , what do you think ? ( CHUCKLES ) I see you 've ... found room for your clown collection . Well , I had to move a few things around . ( GROANS ) Uh , I don 't remember those . Oh , I just bought them . I couldn 't resist . Do you know what I just love about them ? Uh-uh . They 're so ... big . Yeah . Did I ever mention that in Tenctonese culture , there are no clowns ? Yeah , I think you mentioned that . Um ... Well , you did a real , real nice job . Ju-Just one thing-my recliner ? Uh , I don 't see it . Oh , don 't worry . It 's safe . I-I put it in storage . You put my recliner in storage . Well , there wasn 't any room for it . ( CHUCKLES ) I see . No room . Funny , plenty of room for the clowns . Yep . No dearth of space under the big top . Matt , are you angry ? Yeah . I 'm a little PO 'd . I loved that recliner . ( HUFFS ) We 've been together since Super Bowl ' 92 . But ... where would I have put the love seat ? Hey , the recliner was here first . I don 't understand . You said to me , " This is your home now . Make yourself comfortable . " That doesn 't mean make me uncomfortable ! You should 've asked first , at least . Well , I-I 'm sorry . But since you insisted that we move into your ... chuchlach ... I thought if nothing else , you would at least let me nest like a Tenctonese female . ( SIGHS ) Cathy ! " What would you rather do at the beach : Play volleyball , lie in the sun , or go snorkeling ? " In salt water ? Like I 'm gonna fry myself to death ? Okay , so the form 's written for humans . The agency just needs your profile so they can find you a job . All right , volleyball . No , no , no , wait . Lie in the sun . Catch some U.V. I-I wouldn 't go to the beach anyway . Volleyball . I am really destined for great things . Can 't even fill out a stupid profile . George ? Susan , I ... I 'm sorry about last night . So am I. I realize our-our sex life has been a little mundane lately . Well , I 'm sure I 'm partly to blame . After all , it does take two . Uh , Susan , when you fondle my knee like that ... I know . Maybe if I fondled them more often ... Well , I really can 't afford to ... Maybe then you wouldn 't need May . What ? If I 'd been more responsive to your needs , Nemu . ( GROANS ) No , Susan . You 've got this all wrong . This doesn 't have anything to do with you . This doesn 't have anything to do with me ? Not the way you think . I want to help Albert and May . I 'm not having sex with her to have sex with her . So you 've decided . You 're gonna go ahead with this . Susan ... George , why don 't you just tell me the truth ? I 'm not desirable to you anymore . What ... No , no , no . I don 't mean that . I-I ... I find you-you very , very attractive . ( CRYING ) Oh , I hate it when you get like this . Susan ... ( SOBBING ) D-Don 't touch me . ( GROANS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( HORN HONKS ) You 're looking a bit sour , Matthew . Cathy 86'ed my lounger and sent in the clowns . Oh , clowns . I love clowns . Did you know that clowns are not indigenous to our culture ? George ! ( SHOUTS ) WOMAN : George , are you ... Are you okay ? Sorry . ( GRUNTS ) Albert . These old computers . But look , I got you a new surge protector . It 's the least I could do for my gannaum . Uh , thank you , Albert . And we realize that we were very inconsiderate ... in asking you to set a date for the ceremony without knowing May 's cycle . So here we , um , made a list of all the times when she would be the most fertile . So , um ... Now , this one is a Monday , so it might not be so convenient for some people . Oh , thank you . Thank you , Albert . I 'll , uh , talk to Susan . Okay . ( PHONE RINGING ) ( GROANS ) You know , George , as a longtime observer of criminal behavior ... I 'd say you were trying to hide something . Sikes , you said that I authorized a priority search on a Gayle Warnings ? Oh , thanks , Captain . I didn 't authorize a priority search on anyone . You forged my signature ... again . It tends to speed up the process . Next time , you 're on report . Okay . George , she was employed at a toxic waste disposal plant . ( WOMAN SPEAKING TENCTONESE ON PA ) ( MAN SPEAKING TENCTONESE ON PA ) I 'm Terry Firma . I 'm the owner of New Life . I 'm Detective Sikes . This is Detective Francisco . George . George . It 's all right . Your partner is observing traditional Tenctonese custom when meeting an Eeno . We 're considered unclean . We 're investigating the death of one of your employees , Gayle Warnings . Gayle , dead ? Witnesses say she was attacked by two Eeno males . It 's , uh , more likely Tenctonese . We 're often the victim of hate crimes . From the description of what they were wearing , I 'd say they worked here as well . II certainly hope not . We consider ourselves kind of a family . Well , speaking of family , are you aware that Ms. Warnings was pregnant ? No , actually . Did you know that Gayle Warnings was pregnant , Sorn ? No , I did not . She was contaminated with hydrofluoric acid . Do you process that here ? Yes , among other industrial wastes . Come this way . Eeno . ( WOMAN SPEAKING TENCTONESE ON PA ) MATT : I guess you know hydrofluoric acid is bad news for humans . You don 't have anything to worry about , Detective . This room is the end point in our process . Nothing running through these pipes can hurt you . We neutralize the waste on the elemental level . Using a cold fusion technique that we perfected on the ship ... we 're able to manipulate the strong force within an atom . In the case of hydrofluoric acid , for example ... we transmute the fluorine into neon ... create a harmless inert compound and then flush it into the ocean . Can 't hurt you . Can 't hurt the fish . ( GROANS ) ( MAN SPEAKING TENCTONESE ON PA ) GEORGE : Very impressive . But that doesn 't explain ... how Miss Warnings could have become so contaminated . Yeah . I-I don 't understand it myself . At no point in the process do our technicians come into direct contact with the waste . We 're constantly monitored by OSHA and the EPA . The only thing I can think , she must 've disregarded our safety guidelines . Well , if you learn anything that could help us out , please give us a call . Sure . I 'd be more than happy to do that . Geez . Eenos try not to attract attention to themselves . Living in a society where we 're treated as invisible ... has taught us to be just that . Uh-huh . ( HUMMING ) Hi . Hi . I had a pound of hamburger in the fridge . Have you seen it ? Oh . Oh , what ? Were you going to eat that ? Sure . Why wouldn 't I eat it ? Well , it smelled so bad . Well , it smelled fine . It smelled the way hamburger 's supposed to smell like . Wh-Where is it ? In the bedroom closet , on the back shelf . What ? Well , I couldn 't imagine that anyone would want that meat ... so I used it to create a bacterial culture . A bacterial culture ? Right . What the hell 's the matter with me ? Why didn 't I guess that ? Matt , I 'm sorry . I 'll go to the store . No , it 's okay . Really . I eat too much red meat as it is . You know , all that cholesterol . I 'll just have some vegetables . I 've ruined your dinner . No , no , no . This is great . Really . Fine . Hey , that program that you wanted to see on PBS is on tonight . Uh , Tenctonese barrel dancing ? They dance on the barrels or in the barrels ? Matt , I-I-I-I have to go back to the hospital tonight . I just came home to change my clothes . Well , they were understaffed in Pediatrics ... so I volunteered to work nights all week . All week ? I 'll never see you . I know . ( SCOFFS ) What 's the point of living together if you 're never around ? Well , considering the mess I 've made of things lately , maybe that 's for the best . Cathy . No , Matt . I 'm just not very good at this . Oh , Susan , I just thought you might like to know that barrel dancing special is on tonight . I 'm busy , George . Oh . All right . ( MAN SHOUTING ) ( ELECTRONIC HUMMING ) Buck . Buck ! Whoa ! Geez ! What ? You don 't have a job , and you 're sitting here playing virtual games . Dad , it 's 10 : 00 . There 's not a lot of job interviews this time of night . You lie around the house like some lazy Eeno . You should be thinking about your life . All I ever do is think about my life . The problem is , you have no focus . By the time I got out of quarantine , I knew what I wanted to do . I went out , and I did it . The only reason you did squat was ' cause of affirmative action . Well , that 's gone , so good for you and diddy wipe for me ! ( DOOR OPENS , CLOSES ) Things might be tougher now than when I started . But that 's all the more reason you need a driving purpose , a goal . Are you guys at it again ? Ah , now your sister , she has always had focus . She has always known exactly what she wanted to be . Cut him some slack , Dad . Not everybody wants to be secretary of the interior . It 's the principle of the thing that I 'm talking about . Oh , Emily , by the way , don 't forget , uh , father-daughter day . I know . I just don 't want you to throw away your future . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Yeah , thanks . ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) Traffic problems and everything . Do you think I 'd be foolin ' around down here if there was more to it ? ( CHATTERING ) Hey , that 's an Eeno . What 's an Eeno doing here ? Look , there 's an Eeno . What 's an Eeno ? Ah , now , type " 187 " ... and all the homicide arrests within the last 48 hours come up on your monitor . ( DISK DRIVE WHIRRING ) Well , these old computers are a little slow . ( BEEPS ) Ah . Nihilistic . Now when you have a suspect . Excuse me . You want to check for pri ... You 're Detective Sikes ? Yeah . I 'm Carrie Onbag . I used to work with Gayle Warnings . She was my friend . Uh , please have a seat . She was trying to get away from them so they wouldn 't take her baby . It 's because of them that she 's dead . And if they knew I was here , they 'd kill me too . I just barely managed to escape . Emily , why don 't you wait for me outside , hmm ? No . Who 's " they " ? At the plant . We 're always asleep when it happens . ( WEEPING ) They catalyze and impregnate us . And then when it 's time to transfer the pod ... they just take them away , and we never see our babies . You 're saying Eeno women are being artificially fertilized ... and their offspring stolen from them ? And Terry lied to you about the chemicals . They don 't process the waste . They just store it . Well , thank you for coming down . Hold on . Can you prove any of this ? The chemicals are there . You can find them . They 're in the tunnels . Tunnels ? They 're everywhere ! This is the address of the Bureau of Newcomer Affairs . They 'll help you get settled if you 're afraid to go back to the plant . Aren 't you gonna do anything ? ( EXHALES ) We 'll do whatever we can . How could you treat her like that ? You were horrible ! Well , you heard her . Artificially impregnated and stolen pods and tunnels everywhere . And we 're supposed to take that seriously ? It 's just because she 's an Eeno ! Well , Eenos are certainly known to stretch the truth . I think you 're a bigot ! Do I have to remind you of who Eenos are and what they did ? They ate the flesh of other Tenctonese . Like they had a choice . If you 'd been in their situation ... how do you know you wouldn 't have done the same thing ? Emily . Emily ! ( CORK POPS ) ALL : Congratulations . ( CHATTERING ) So you didn 't get the promotion . Big deal . You 'll get it next time . Yeah , right . Uh , yes , Rick ? Susan , I just wanted to say I think you got a raw deal . It 's too bad I 'm not running this company . Uh-Well , thank you . Susan , uh , listen . I 'm getting together with a few of my friends tonight . Why don 't you come party with us ? What ? Go out ? Yeah . Get your mind off things . Forget about the job . Forget about George . Oh , I don 't know . I ... I don 't feel much like partying . Which is why you need to , girl . Come on . What do you say ? ALBERT : George ! May . Did you check with Susan about those dates ? Uh , the dates ... I 'm getting close to my first fertility spike , George . And if we don 't make a decision soon , we 'll have to wait till my next cycle . Uh ... Well , I 've been thinking , and , uh , maybe I 'm not the best gannaum for you . Uh , what do you mean ? Maybe you should find someone younger with a higher aklacount . ( SCOFFS ) And , uh , genetically speaking , I must tell you ... that premature spot fading does run in my family . Well , we don 't want anybody else . Unless ... you don 't want to be our gannaum . Oh , no . No , no . Of course I want to be your gannaum . What is it then ? Is it your family ? Is it ... Is it Susan ? Does Susan have a problem with this ? No , no . No , no . No , no . No . Well-Well , yes . It 's just that , you see , she sees the ... the delicacy of the situation , the complexity . Complexity ? Well , you are another female , May . And I can 't have intercourse with Susan . Well , it 's just that she 's feeling a little fragile right now ... with her work and-and me , and ... well , this isn 't helping any . And , well , who knows ? Maybe she 'll feel different . ( PHONE RINGS ) Hey , George . Listen to this . According to a Dr. Frances Tacker ... She 's an environmental engineer out at UCLA ... no one 's found a way to transmute fluorine by cold fusion or anything else . Well , she 's a human , right ? Yeah . So ? Well , what does she know about Tenctonese technology ? She knows every time she 's tried to get New Life to demonstrate the operation ... they 've always made some excuse . Dr. Tacker thinks it 's a scam . What about OSHA and the EPA inspectors ? Oh , come on , George . They 're both way understaffed . Every 10 years some yo-yo comes in and signs them off . The big question is , if they 're not processing the waste , where are they hiding it ? In some tunnels maybe ? CARRIE : Please help me . Please . Nothing for you , Eeno . Oh , please ? Go back to the sewer . Hi . I brought you some things . Uh , a sweater , some warm socks . There 's food in here too . Thank you . ( GASPS ) ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) Hey , look . Eeno 's got a friend . Eeno lover . Eeno lover . Well , maybe she 's not a friend . Maybe she 's dinner . Watch out , Eeno lover . You 'll wind up on a plate ! ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) You probably don 't taste too good , Eeno lover . EMILY : Help us ! You need a little salt . ( SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMING ) Captain , the judge denied our request for a warrant to search New Life . So what do you want me to do ? Get him on the phone and scream . Get us that warrant . You , uh , obviously didn 't get the message . The city isn 't enthusiastic about any investigation of New Life . What do you mean ? Money . How do you think Congress balanced the federal budget ? They shafted the cities . We can 't afford light bulbs , and you want to investigate ... one of the few businesses that 's bringing some revenue into this town ? What ? Taxes ? That 's just the beginning . Every load of waste that 's delivered to New Life , the city collects a fee . Remember all those third world countries we used to ship our toxic crap to ? Well , they ship to us now . Them and everybody else . ( RUMBLING ) Earthquake ! WOMAN : Hold on ! Hold on ! MAN : Hello ! 4.1 . 4.3 . Huh ? ( KNOCKING ON TABLE ) Hey , Braveheart . Listen , all the fees in the world aren 't gonna help the city if it 's sittin ' on a cesspool . That just goes to show how much you know . Let me tell you ... George ? What ? We just got a call . Your daughter 's been involved in a street disturbance down in Little Tencton . They 've taken her to county hospital . Buck , where 's Emily ? Doctor 's in with her . How is she ? They beat her up pretty bad . Carrie , too . But I guess you wouldn 't care about some lazy Eeno . Did you call your mother ? They 're trying to find her . Oh . ( GASPS ) Ow . Emily . Dad . She was very lucky . If the salt water had gotten in her eyes , she 'd be blind . Carrie ? How 's Carrie ? She 's in X-ray . We think it 's just the arm that 's broken . What were you doing in Little Tencton with that Eeno girl ? I just wanted to help her . They hit her for no reason . She didn 't do anything ! They just hit her and hit her . Oh , Emily . Why don 't you let me finish up in here ? We 'll be out in just a few minutes . Here you go . I already put the mustard in there . ( EXHALES ) This was my fault . What ? George . Just a bunch of punks who ought to be flambéed . No . No , Matt . It was hatred . Their hatred , mine . It makes no difference . It poisoned me , almost got my daughter killed . Yeah , well , it didn 't . When I was on the slave ship , alone in my cell ... I would be seized with terror asking myself how far I would go to survive . Would I ... betray a friend ? Would I deny my family ? Every day I did things that I was ashamed of . Where would I draw the line ? Emily was right . And you ... You-You were right . Anyone could 've done what the Eenos did . That 's why we make them our " escape-goats . " ( CHUCKLES ) " Scapegoats " ? Oh , yes . Scapegoats . We hate them because they make us confront ourselves . George . EMILY : Hi , Carrie . Miss Onbag . I 'm so very sorry . I 'd like to help you if you 'll let me . There is this place that I 've heard of . Eenos live here ? That 's what I 've been told . MATT : Hello ! Anybody home ? Nope . Nobody home . They 're near . Oh , yeah ? We 'll wait . ( ANIMALS HOWLING ) Are you cold ? No . Sittin ' in the middle of nowhere , nothing to eat , no beer . Why not ? Cathy 's off saving all the little tots from ringworm . I 've got nothing better to do tonight . Oh , boy . Oh , yeah . MATT : Hi . How 's it going ? ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) What 'd she say ? Are we in trouble ? No . We are grateful that you brought her . We can help her learn how to live with dignity . Come . Uh , where are we going ? I haven 't the faintest idea . Wow . We watched , and we listened . We talked amongst ourselves , and we decided that we could trust you ... that maybe you could do something . These are pictures of a dream most of us have had . MATT : What does it mean ? Tells about a-a birth ... of a queen or a queen mother . Not human , not Tenctonese . Queen mother . Queen bee ? And what 's that , some kind of hive ? It says the queen mother will bring about a new order ... that the Eenos will serve as her priests . All other creatures will bow before them . That 's nice . Real nice . You don 't understand . We showed you this to warn you . We don 't believe this is just a dream . We believe that there are Eenos who already serve the queen mother ... and if she isn 't stopped , she will destroy your civilization . All civilization will be destroyed ... by her . ♪ ( CHORUS CONTINUES ) ♪ ( GROWLING ) ( SPEAKING TENCTONESE ) ( ROARS ) ( GROANS ) It 's me . Anybody home ? Yeah . ( SIGHS ) Fat chance .

That gas has been identified as fluorine ... fluorine , which is given off by certain types of industrial waste . Now , luckily there were no serious injuries today . However , authorities have told me that in heavy enough concentrations ... fluorine is fatal to human beings . Now , right now the source of that gas remains a mystery .

This isn 't the first time . In the last year and a half , there have been three leaks ... all fluorine , all from unknown sources . First one was when the Bonaventure was demolished . The second one ... was after another quake . The third one was after a natural gas line exploded . All ground disturbances . Yeah . Now check this out . Plotted the locations of all four leaks . Look at this . Come on ! Ah ! The old streetcar system ... the Red Car ? All of this was underground . And above ground , where the old terminal was the New Life plant . Carrie 's tunnels .

The Eeno drawing . No judge is gonna give us a search warrant , George . We gotta go down there on our own . You 'll need protective gear . I 'll wrangle a suit from Cathy . It was amazing . And the Eenos showed us their drawings because they wanted to warn us . What 's Dad gonna do about it ? He wasn 't sure . He rags on me , says I 'm not focused , and he 's gonna do nothing ? That 's real focused . Buck , Dad 's a policeman . He can 't just do whatever he wants . But what happens to the Eenos in the plant ? Okay . All right . We 'll see who 's focused .

This must be the new order from the Eeno drawing-some kind of mutant Newcomer species . How did this happen ? Matt , do you remember the Eeno fetus ? How deformed it was ? It must feed off hydrofluoric acid in the womb . Hydrofluoric acid in those honeycombs ... They must eat the stuff . ( GROANING ) Uh , like I said , let 's get out of here . Buck , you wait here . Dad ... No ! Wait here ! Freeze ! Aah ! Not a good idea . These are the fetuses , aren 't they ? The ones you take from the Eeno females . So she went to the police . You contaminate Eeno females with hydrofluoric acid . To deform their offspring , to create these monsters . They are not monsters . They 're the future . The Earth is choking on waste . We can tolerate it . They ... thrive on it . Something had to be done . Humans are destroying this planet . They will save it . They will consume all the waste .

The one they call the queen mother , she was your first ... You know about the queen mother ? We didn 't create her . A pregnant Eeno female was accidentally exposed to hydrofluoric acid . She aborted just before the transfer to male stage . The fetus lived . ( GROWLING ) She 's waiting for you . Well , she can wait a little longer . You guys really think with a queen in your back pocket , you 're gonna rule the world ? All we want is to live with dignity . For generations , the Eenos have been outcasts . No more . We will control our destiny . Yeah ? I hate to tell you this , but you ain 't driving this bus . She is . What do you mean ? We created them . They can 't exist without us .

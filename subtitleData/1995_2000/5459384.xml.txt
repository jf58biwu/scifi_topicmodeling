 [ Man ] Jarod was a real even-tempered man . Stayed here for about a week , then he was gone . I sort of act as building manager here ... but my real passion is acupuncture . Jarod really got into it too . You stuck needles into him ? Actually , I taught him how to do it himself . - For what purpose ? - Stress reduction . I 'm very good at reducing tensions in the body . Funny . I 'm very good at causing them . Jarod wanted the needles placed along the brachial plexus . Brachial plexus ? Nerve center for the upper extremities ? [ Man ] He wanted me to leave them in until his arm was paralyzed . He 'd walk around like that for days . You obviously lived through the ' 60s . Does your companion know the concept of free love ? - When did he leave ? - Two days ago . Well , then our work here is mercifully done . Oh . But then you 'll miss out on this . He said you 'd know what it meant . This building isn 't far from here . Hmm . [ Chattering ] - [ Woman ] He 's up there . - [ Sirens Wailing ] Where the hell 's my cameraman ? - It 's a long way down . - Stay away from me . - Stay away from me . - I just want to talk to you . Jarod , what the hell are you doing up there ? You 'd better be rolling on this guy . My name 's Jarod . What 's your name ? Dave . My name 's Dave . Beautiful family . I 'm guessing that 's your wife and your children . They 're gone . They were evicted , and now I can 't find them . Dave , I 'm sure they 're fine . I 'll bet they 're out there somewhere worrying about you . Nobody 's worried about me . If that were true , would I be up here on this ledge ? I 'm sure that they are looking for you . Why should they ? I drink some . I can help you find them , Dave . Use the camera . Tell them how much you love them ... how much you miss them , how much you need them . But first , we have to get off this ledge . Grab my hand . [ Man Narrating ] [ Chattering ] [ Jarod ] Grab my hand . Only thing would 've made this better was if thejumper was a topless dancer . - [ Laughs ] - Poor guy . Annie , edit out some clips for the promo team A.S.A.P. This runs tonight . We gotta get some footage of this loser 's wife and kids . Maybe they 've checked into a homeless shelter . After all this , don 't you think the family deserves a little privacy ? Privacy ? To get her face on the 10 : 00 news and some party money in her pocket ... this guy 's wife 'll jump at the chance . - No pun intended , huh ? - [ Men Laugh ] Too bad you got such a good grip there , Jarod . - Why is that ? - A heroic attempt is as good as a save . The plunge would 've given this piece a better punch . Spoken like an anchorman who wants his anchor back . You know , Jarod , if my instincts are as good as I know they are ... your face is going to be running in every living room in America . Actually , I think it would play better ... if Phil got credit for the save . - What ? - I mean , he 's the talent . He 's the hero that everyone tunes in to see each day , not me . Only problem is , our hero was standing in a parking lot 100 feet below the action . - Yes , I know , but you never saw my face . - So ? So if you cut in just after I make the grab ... we use all the coverage I shot before I got up on the roof . We lay in Phil 's voice-over , and then we tag it with ... a pickup shot of Phil exiting the building with the jumper . We 're not long for a two-share and last place with that kind of attitude . Do it . - But Chris , it 's ... - Unethical ? You heard me . Make Phil a hero . - I thought only God rewrote history . - God never won sweeps . - [ Miss Parker ] Beautiful part of town . - [ Sydney ] Dangerous . No wonderJarod left the notebook with the acupuncturist . - He doesn 't want us down here . - Come on , Sydney . We 're here . Let 's see if Ratboy left anything behind . This is futile . Jarod 's long gone . Afraid of the dark , Syd ? Only when I can 't see what 's in it . [ Clatter ] - Damn it . - [ Clatter ] Miss Parker , maybe we should get the cleanup team to check this place out . Forget it , Syd . I 'd trade a dozen Ferragamos for oneJarod any day . [ Object Clangs ] I 'm counting to three . Then I 'm going to shoot whoever you are . One ... two ... Three . ! - What do you want ? - What you got ? I have a nine millimeter in your face ... and you appear to have a knife ... a rusty knife . Oh , you must be feeling lucky today . - [ Glass Shatters ] - [ Sydney Shouts ] [ Groaning ] [ Chuckles ] Are you feeling lucky today , hmm ? Get their wallets andjewelry and let 's get out ofhere . [ Keyboarding ] Writing Phil 's copy for him too ? I 'm just trying to send a message to an old friend . So you think I was wrong ... letting Phil take credit for saving the jumper . As our new , esteemed news director always reminds me ... I get paid to cut tape , not to think . From what I understand , you win awards doing it . Well , awards don 't count for much around here . Pulitzer 's rolling over in his grave , and Nielsen 's packing down the dirt . Phil has asked me to go over some of his old footage ... to see how he likes to be shot . Do you think maybe you could show me some of his old tapes ? Yeah . - Second shelf . - Great . Thank you . The Ken Watanabe shooting . I heard about this . So has half the world . And our Ivy League Hitler was pissed we didn 't hook the other half . It 's Chris 's job to know what people want ... and it 's our job to make sure they get it . Which doesn 't mean we should throw out anything resembling journalistic integrity . If it bleeds , it leads . That 's the new wave of the news , Annie , like it or not . We either surf along with it , or we get torn apart in the riptide . [ Annie ] It 's really an act . Phil actually worships Cronkite in secret midnight rituals . Hmm . Who 's Cronkite ? You 're gonna fit in just fine here . Tonight , exclusively on Seattle 's Channel 43 ... our continuing series on local gangs . In this shocking footage , our own cameraman , Ken Watanabe ... captured on videotape a gang gathering ... at the North Puget dock area . But what happened next took us both by surprise . Out of nowhere , the 15th Street Bleeders ... crashed the turf of the Burns ... leading to an explosive conflict ... a conflict in which one of our own became a casualty . - Oh , God , I 'm hit . Oh , God . Oh , God . - [ Gunfire ] Phil , where are you ? Phil , I 'm hit . I 'm hit , man . My arm . My arm . I can 't move my arm . Get me out ofhere , man . - Get me out of here . - Come on . Come on . Come on . Get up . Tonight , our prayers are with Ken Watanabe ... a courageous young cameraman . God bless you , Ken . Phil Campbell , Channel 43 News , at 10 : 00 . Dehlila , I think about you so much , my brain hurts . I have to meet you , to see you . - [ Phone Rings ] - Samson . I mean , Broots . Mr. Parker ? Uh , Mr. Parker , sir . How-How can I help you , sir ? Uh ... Uh , no . No , sir , I haven 't seen your daughter since yesterday . Sydney neither . I mean , either . Y-Yes , sir . I 'll get on it right away , sir . - Yeah , well , it 's a pleasure talk ... talk ... - [ Click , Dial Tone ] Hello ? Hello ? - Jarod . ! - Dave ? You look great . A step at a time . That 's what they tell me . I just came by to say thanks . Of course , the way that story aired ... - I don 't know if I should thank that reporter Phil or you . - [ Laughs ] Well , strange things happen in TV . I 'm glad you 're doing well . I don 't know what got into me . Did you find your wife and kids ? Yeah , but she doesn 't want me back until I find a job , so ... - I 'll keep my eyes open . - Yeah . - What do you keep looking at ? - Oh , those wires there . If they 're planning on hooking up that satellite dish to them wires ... they 're gonna blow out their electricity in nothing flat . - You 're an electrician ? - Nope . Satcom grunt . I wasn 't any better at jumping out of airplanes than I am from buildings ... but I do know a wiring problem when I see one . Hey , thanks again , really . - Good luck . - Thanks . Phil , these pieces are excellent . Twenty years of broadcasting will do that . I was especially impressed with the Ken Watanabe segment . I was wondering . Is the raw footage lying around somewhere ? I 'd love to see how it was cut together . Most of those tapes get recycled . Even with a piece this good ? Yeah , well , the station didn 't use to charge me for parking either . Yeah , right . - Way to go , Dave . - [ Chattering ] [ Grunting ] [ Pipes Clanking ] As if getting mugged wasn 't enough . [ Weakly ] You shot me . I did not shoot you . It was an accident . I never liked guns . I hope you 'll stop carrying yours now . [ Sighs ] - You 're bleeding again . - [ Groans ] - I need something else to tie this wound with . - What about that neck scarf ? - It 's one of a kind , Sydney . - [ Chuckles ] Which is what my good leg will be if we don 't stop the bleeding . [ Shuddering ] I 'm sorry . [ Groaning , Grunting ] [ Sighs ] - Thank you . - You 're going into shock . You need to be warm . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , Sydney . Don 't look now , but we are ground zero for detonation ... to bring this dump down . Please tell me that you told someone where we were going . [ Sighs ] [ Cooing ] There 's something I don 't understand . - What 's that ? - Where are the little ones ? The what ? You always see the big pigeons , you know , with the scars ... and the broken wings and the missing legs . But you never see the little ones . - I never really thought about it . - Hey , I know you . You 're the cameraman that was on the news . - I 'm Jarod Crane . - Ken . That was incredible footage you captured . Thanks . I never planned on becoming a story though . When are you going back to work at the station ? And do what ? Log commercials ? I 'm a shooter , man . My days on the front line are over . You know , it 's funny . You plan for your life to go up one road ... and when you finally get there , the bridge washes out . Well , you never know . Life has a strange way of surprising you . Hey , look at that . [ Ken ] I 'll be damned . Like I said , life is full of surprises . [ Beeping ] Ken Watanabe and Phil Campbell , February 18 , roll number one . Okay . Uh ... Nothing fancy , Kenny . We 're just gonna go in there ... and we 're gonna sit down , and we 're gonna listen to the Burns ... talk about their side of this turf war . These guys tend to talk with their guns . Know what I 'm saying ? You don 't have to worry about getting fancy from me . Don 't worry about it , Ken . You 'll be fine . [ Exhales ] Let 's do it . [ Ken ] You sure these guys are gonna show ? [ Phil ] Yeah , they 'll be here . Don 't worry about it . Okay , um ... Right up there . Head there . [ Ken ] You been hanging with the homies , Phil , huh ? Yo ! Hey , D-Mac ! Hey , D-Mac ! Bleeders in the hood ! [ Gunfire Resumes ] - [ Tires Screeching ] - I 'm hit ! I 'm hit ! Oh , God ! - My arm ! My arm ! - [ Gunfire Continues ] I 'm hit , man ! Phil , get me out of here , man ! - Get me out of here ! Get me out of here ! - You 're okay . Get me out of here , man ! Get me out of here ! Get me out of here ! Interesting undershirt , Phil . Flak jacket standard issue for a street reporter now , Phil ? I 'm dying for a cigarette ! How the hell did I end up here ? You regret taking on theJarod assignment ? - I regret a lot of things . - Such as ? I regret not going to the prom . I regret laughing at my first boyfriend ... when he told me I was the one . And in this instant , I regret not having ... a nicotine patch the size of a doormat . [ Groans ] Oh , no . Your ulcer , huh ? And no medication . [ Sighs ] Ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous Sherlock Holmes . [ Groaning ] Let me see it , Sydney . Regret 's often born out of a lack of choice , you know ? Unlike you , Syd , I don 't think that everything is out of my control . You do when it comes to your father . Please , don 't ... don 't misunderstand that . Why don 't you just say it ? I caved . I always do around him . You can still walk up to your father and tell him ... " Dad , I 'm leaving . ' " [ Chuckling ] [ Chuckling ] Right . I can see it now . Two kids , a little yellow house ... chitchatting with the girls over lattes at the mall . You still have a future , Miss Parker . It 's a hell of a future , sitting here waiting to get blown to bits . [ Chuckles ] [ Laughing ] Here I am , trying to comfort you . [ Laughing Continues ] As if anything you could ever do would give me comfort . It did once . You are one hell of a thrower , Jarod . It 's about understanding the projectile 's aerodynamics . Well , actually , I just close one eye and let it fly . - Oh . - That 's it . Good game . I should 've warned you . I don 't like to lose . - Good man . - Next round 's on me . [ Patrons Cheering ] Phil certainly is in a good mood tonight . You must be very proud of Annie and Phil getting nominated for the Ken Watanabe segment . Yeah , even stiffs like Phil get lucky . If only Grecian Formula were talent . Awards help the promo guys , I suppose . They also make a news team lazy . News is about being hungry . Always has been . You guys gonna drink water all night , or are you coming to join the real party ? And you , smile . [ Laughing ] - Is this about Ken ? - He should be here . Somebody forgot to invite him . [ Inaudible ] He must 've been very proud , taking one for the team . [ Chris ] KTJE 's got a hell of a medical package . Watanabe 's all right . Ken 's gonna be fine . Look , everybody in this business knows ... that putting your tail on the line is a job requirement . Ken was green . He was too zealous , and it cost him . If I 'd have known how dangerous it was , I never would 've let him go out there . I 'm sure you wouldn 't . I 'm not trying to be a pest , but I 've got the Tower breathing down my neck to find them . Now surely there 's got to be a Sweeper team somewhere near the New York City area . Excuse me ? What business is it of yours what my clearance level is ? - Now , listen . You S.I.S. guys are really startin ' to tick me off . - [ Phone Ringing ] Hold on a second . Just hold on . - Broots ! - It 's me . Don 't bother trying to trace me . - I 've scrambled the source signal . - Jarod ? - I 've been trying to contact Sydney . - Join the party . He and Miss Parker went looking for you two days ago . We haven 't heard from them since . She 's too persistent for her own good . You 're going to have to find them . You don 't know how peaceful it 's been here without her . Would it be more peaceful working for Raines ? - Mr. Raines ? No . - Take down this address . 1811 North Bushnell Street , the Bronx . [ Crying ] [ Soft Chattering ] Miss Parker ? Tell me again how my mother died . Stop torturing yourself . I know it wasn 't suicide . Was she murdered because of the rescued children ? - I don 't know . - Was it my father ? Miss Parker , I know about your mother 's life , not about her death . She was a kind woman ... a driving force at the Centre in those days when it was still involved in ... altruistic projects . I can 't believe the Centre was ever involved with anything positive . We helped four countries become democracies during the cold war . We brought the sides together for the Korean Peace Accord . And rumor has it that we even helped design the Popemobile . The Centre saved thousands oflives ... lives that they later reclaimed ... as it turned out , in other ways . Why didn 't you leave when things turned ? There were others whose welfare ... was of more concern to me than my own . Jarod . He 's not very different from us , you know ? We 'd all have taken very different paths ... had we had our way . - Here you go . Pass the ball , man . - [ Chattering ] - Boo-ya ! - Excuse me . Excuse me . I think that was traveling . You must be crazy , stupid or both . No , no . After you lifted your pivot foot , you took more than the allotted two steps ... as outlined in the official rule book . - Mmm . - Pizza ? Thank you , anyway , but it already comes presliced . Help yourselves . - What , you got a death wish or something , man ? - Not that I know of . Didn 't your mama ever tell you that white people shouldn 't ... go walking through other people 's neighborhoods ? Well , I never actually knew my mother , so I guess the answer is no . My name 's Jarod Crane . I 'm with Channel 43 News . I 'm looking for a D-Mac . - You gonna put him on TV ? - Quite possibly , yes . - I 'm D-Mac . - Nice to meet you . Ow . ! He 's got game . The boy 's got some game . [ Chattering ] Hey , man , that camera guy shouldn 't have been there . - Tell me what happened . - A man hits my cell phone . He must 've paid somebody off to get the number . Sounded white . Tells me he wants to talk about the turf wars . Sounded cool to me . This white man that called you , is that unusual ? You really didn 't have no mother , did you ? I never knew my old lady either . Later I heard word the Bleeders got the same call . They show up , and boom , boom , the fireworks started . Do you remember what day you got this call ? I don 't know . Hey , Duane , man , bring my Day Runner . We 're bangers , not cavemen . Thanks , man . Okay , here you go . February 18 , at about 8 : 00 at night . Could you tell me your cell phone number ? [ Chattering ] [ Crying ] - Take Miss Parker upstairs . - Yes , sir . You get some rest now . - If you ever want to talk to me , I 'm always here . - [ Crying Continues ] - Okay ? - Thank you , Sydney . Sydney ? Why is everyone wearing black ? How come you 're so sad ? We 're remembering someone who has left us , Jarod . Is it the woman that got shot in the elevator ? Miss Parker 's mother , isn 't it ? Don 't you ever speak of that to anyone ever again , understand ? [ Groans ] I could 've saved him . Who ? Jarod . He should have lived a normal life . - They would 've killed you . - [ Chuckles ] You can 't kill someone who 's already dead . [ Shuddering ] You do remember . You broke into my edit file and stole footage ? " Borrowed " is more like it . - And I did it for Ken Watanabe . - You lost me . - Ken was set up . - What are you talking about ? What happened to Ken happened because Phil is desperate for ratings . l-l-I don 't buy that . Buy it . Why else would Phil have been wearing a bulletproof vest the night that Ken was shot ? You actually think Phil would do something like that ? I 'm certain of it . Annie , you know him . You 've seen the kind of pressure that Phil has been under to get back on top . Yeah , but to risk somebody else 's life . He 's a desperate man , Annie . He was the king of the hill , and now he 's on his way out . Annie , I need your help to stop him . Hello , Dave . This is Jarod . How would you like to come to work for Channel 43 ? Uh-huh . You can tell your wife you 've got a job . [ Rap , Indistinct ] Lights . [ Continues ] Camera . Hello , Annie . I 'm setting up a very special screening in Chris 's office . I want you to do me a favor . Make sure the general manager is there . Action . [ Jarod ] Phil . Chris just got word of a summit going down between two rival gangs . He thinks it 's going to make a terrific follow-up to the Ken Watanabe segment . Chris tipped you on this ? His snitch said there could be fireworks , and fireworks mean ratings . Let 's go . Phil , why don 't you test your headset ? Check , one , two . So , where shall we set up ? Over here . We can cover the door , stay in the shadows . Uh , Jarod . Something doesn 't feel right about this . Well , it 's a pretty scary place . That and the fact that Ken Watanabe was shot just outside of that door . That might have something to do with it . But putting our tail on the line ... it 's part of thejob , isn 't it ? Okay , Jarod . Jarod ? - Jarod ! - [ Door Opens ] - [ Man ] Burns in the house . ! - [ Man # 2 ] Word . ! [ Men Shouting ] - Bring your punk-asses out ! - Let 's go . ! - Don 't wait for their asses . - Jarod , where are you ? [ Jarod On Headset ] Above you . [ Phil ] This is not good . [ On Headset ] It 's okay . I 've got you in my sights . Smile , Phil . It 's showtime . Annie , why is the general manager here ? I think you have a meeting with him . Mr. Ferren , what a surprise . Nice to see you again , Mr. Ferren . Show 's about to begin , gentlemen . Please take your seats . I 'm intrigued , Rockwell . This must be some show you 've put together . Yes , sir . The best . [ Men Shouting ] - [ Man On TV ] What ? - What you want with me ? - What 's up , fool ? - [ Mr. Ferren ] What is this , a gang fight ? - Want some of this , huh ? You want some of this ? - [ Chris ] Is that Phil ? - What you got ? - Jarod , these guys are gonna kill each other . - [ Jarod ] It 'll be great TV . - You call me here to threaten my ass ? This is on you , dog . Deal or die . [ Chattering ] This is great stuff , Phil . Get closer so we can pick up sound . I 've got no cover here , you idiot ! I 'm getting out of here . [ Jarod ] Don 't leave now , Phil . You 're gonna miss the story . [ Man ] You want some of this ? Huh ? You want some of this ? - [ Jarod ] Or maybe you are the story . - [ Banging ] - What the hell is this ? - [ Banging ] - He 's mine ! - Jarod , help me ! Jarod , help me ! - Jarod . ! - [ Men Chattering ] - Jarod , help me ! - Yeah ! This is great . This is great . Keep it up . Look what we got here , fellas . Uh-huh . Dave , ready to go citywide ? Get ready , Seattle . [ Men Whooping ] - So what we gonna do with this white punk ? - [ Men Grumbling ] I say we bury his sorry ass right where he stands . - [ Clicking ] - [ Grumbling Continues ] [ Man ] Hey , it 's on every channel . [ Man # 2 ] Something 's going on . Look at this . [ Jarod ] This is gonna be a great piece , Phil . Just keep them talking . [ Men Chattering On TV ] This guy 's gonna shoot me . - Just like Ken Watanabe ? - What ? Jarod , come down here . ! What 's up ? You gonna do the deed or not ? ' Cause if you 're not ... - [ Guns Cocking ] - No , no , you can 't shoot me ! No , you can 't ! He 's got a TV camera on you . Cameras . They can do wonderful things . But Ken Watanabe 's camera couldn 't stop him from getting shot . I didn 't know there was gonna be shooting . But you did know that a rival gang was going to be there ... because you tipped them off ... and that 's why you wore a bulletproof vest . I tipped them off . Okay , okay ! [ Jarod ] You knew you were putting Ken Watanabe in danger ... but you didn 't care because all you care about is getting the story . Yes ! Please , help me ! I can 't do that , Phil . It 's ratings at all costs . Like you always say , " If it bleeds , it leads . " I set him up . I set him up . I set it up , okay ? - You got what you need , bro ? - It 's a slam dunk . I got everything I need right here . [ Men Laughing ] " I set him up ! I set him up ! " [ Voices , Indistinct ] That was the money shot you 've all been waiting for . Jarod Crane , Channel 43 News , reporting . [ Crowd Murmuring ] I 'm holding you responsible for this , Mr. Rockwell . Forget the liability this station faces in light of this . You ruined a man 's life . - Sir , I ... - Save it . Save it . You want a news flash , Chris ? You 're fired . [ All Murmuring ] Oh , my God . Miss Parker ! Sydney ! - It can 't be . - Sydney ! Miss P. ! - Broots ! You moron ! - Miss Parker . ! Down here . ! Sydney , wake up . [ Chattering ] Hi . How 're you doing ? I figured you guys might be hungry . Forget that . Does anybody smoke ? Smoke ? - No . - No . Hi . Uh , can l ... Thank you . Boy , it 's lucky I found you guys . Otherwise , you would 've been toast . You can put any fantasy about me thanking you to rest , Broots . [ Huffs ] Right . [ Chuckles ] So , what did you guys talk about all this time ? Nothing . Nothing at all . [ Huffs ] You 're welcome . This is great . I don 't know how to thank you . - I mean , you built this harness for me ... - [ Chuckling ] and got me myjob back at the station . You 've got to promise me that this will never make the air . I promise . Well , you 're gonna have to send me the video . - That 's what you do , isn 't it ? - Yeah , it is . - Good luck , huh ? - Take care . [ Woman Over Headset ] We got you covered down here , Jarod . This could be a new world record . Now , that would be news , wouldn 't it ?

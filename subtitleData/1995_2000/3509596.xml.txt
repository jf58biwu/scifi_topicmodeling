I 'm a doctor . it doesn 't look bad . what the hell are you doing ? hey , old man , did you hear what I said ? motion detectors integrated into the walls . tough to spot . oh , god ! oh , god. oh , god . wait a second . let 's all just relax for a minute . does anybody remember how they got here ? perogies ! i was eating dinner . perogies ; cheese and potato . i ran out of sour cream , and then I went to the fridge , and then ... i don 't know . you ? leaven ? i ... i just went to bed and ... what about you ? i just woke up here . middle of the night . it 's like chile. they always come in the middle of the night . who ? only the government could build something this ugly . oh , it ain 't government . then what is it ? i don 't know . aliens . please. we 're spooked enough as it is . let 's ... let 's rule out aliens for now , and concentrate on what we know . my mom 's gonna freak . rennes ? i just won 't be there . they 'll freak . what do you think , rennes ? well , it won 't solve jack shit sitting still . I 'm moving in a straight line till I get to the end . all right . i tend to agree . shouldn 't we wait here ? for what ? to see if anybody comes . no one 's gonna come . look , there 's away in here . so there 's gotta be away out . we can avoid the traps using the boot . holloway , is it ? what do you think ? look for an exit ? okay . what about you ? it can 't be that simple . it won 't be that simple . look around . take a good , long look-see . 'cause I got a feeling it 's looking at us . i just wanna wake up . leaven . we can do this . we just have to stay calm , and work together as a team . there 's gonna be a lot of people looking for us on the outside . I 'm a cop . all right ? you 're a cop ? yeah . I 'm going to get you out of here . I promise . you gotta be with me on this one . okay . okay ? boot it . clean . that one sounded closer . it 's mechanical. seems to come at regular intervals . maybe it 's their ventilation system . no vents . holloway : no kidding . I 'm boiling . what is it ? serial numbers ? holloway : room numbers . they 're different in each room . oh , great. well , it 's only , uh , 566 million , 400,000 odd rooms in this thing . well , there better not be . we have about three days without food and water before we 're too weak to move . well , they have to feed us , don 't they ? holloway ? oh , we have heat , stress , physical exertion , i.e. dehydration . headaches , dizziness , confused mental processes . the body eventually begins to break down its own tissue . suck on it . keeps the saliva flowing . what ? the air seems dry in there . trapped ? molecular-chemical sensor . why the hell didn 't the boot set it off ? the boot 's not alive . it detects hydrogen sulphide excreted from the skin . how is it you know so much about sensors , rennes ? renne , not rennes . it 's french . fine , you 're french . I 'm asking how ... renne ! sensor expert . about the right age . i don 't believe it . this guy 's ' the wren ' . the what ? he 's ' the wren ' . the bird of attica . flew the coop out of six major prisons . seven . holloway : you 're kidding , right ? you can get us out ? maybe . an escape artist . yeah , harry fucking houdini . the only reason I dragged you this far is ' cause I need your boots . if you don 't smarten up , I 'm gone like that . no more talking , no more guessing , don 't even think about nothing that 's not right in front of ya . that 's the real challenge . you gotta save yourselves from yourselves . merde ! get him out ! oh , my god . so , it was electro - chemical or whatever , right ? and he missed it . 'the wren ' . that 's great . that 's fucking great . all right . it 's time to reassess this place . I 've been over it again and again . why would they throw innocent people in here ? are we being punished ? i have never done any - thing to deserve this . forget about all that . you can 't see the big picture from in here , so don 't try . keep your head down . keep it simple. just ... just look at what 's in front of you . that 's what he said . start with us . we got an escape artist and a cop . there 's gotta be a reason for that . you 're a doctor , holloway . that gives you a function , a reason , right ? no , it just makes me go , ' why me , and not one of the other 10 million doctors out there ? ' leaven ? what are you ? nothing . i just go to school . i hang out with my friends . what else ? there is nothing else . my parents are these people . i live with them . I 'm boring . i think we have to ask the big questions . what does it want ? what is it thinking ? one down , four to go . why don 't you tell us what your purpose is , worth ? often wondered that myself . I 'm just a guy . i work in an office building , doing office building stuff . i wasn 't exactly bursting with joie de vivre before I got here . life just sucks in general . oh , I can 't stand that attitude . because he 's right ? what 's your purpose , quentin ? kids . three of them . i haven 't made my peace yet . but I 'm getting outta here no matter what . that 's where my strength comes from . you people find yours wherever you got it . for christ 's sake , worth , what do you live for ? don 't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something ? nope. but I 've got a pretty fine collection of pornography . how nice ! nice ! i haven 't got anybody either , but I 'm not giving up . i am pissed off . they came into our homes . they stripped us bare . they took my rings . they took ... oh , my amethyst . i want to know who 's responsible . leaven . your glasses . you don 't need them . they 're for reading . well , they took off her jewellery , but they must have ... put these on you . if nothing 's random , why are they here ? leaven , what do you do in school ? math ! what can they mean ? sssh ! 149 . prime numbers . i can 't believe I didn 't see it before . see what ? it seems like if any of these numbers are prime , then the room is trapped . okay , um , 645 . 645 . that 's not prime . 372 . no . 649 . right . 11 times 59 . it 's not prime either . so that room is safe . wait , wait , wait. how can you make that assumption based on one prime number trap ? I 'm not. the incinerator thing was prime . 83 . the molecular-chemical thingy had 137 . the acid room had 149 . you remember all that in your head ? i have a facility for it . leaven . you beautiful brain . boot it . okay , out of the way . brains before beauty . safe ! safe ! prime numbers ! prime numbers ! prime numbers . prime numbers . prime numbers ... how long have we been in here ? nine or ten hours . how do you know ? 5 : 00 o 'clock shadow . last thing I remember was shaving . i guess I missed breakfast . or lunch. or whatever . well , don 't worry . I 'll have you home in time for dinner . if we get out , I 'll make you dinner . you 've got a date . doing good . i need to smoke . I 'd smoke a butt off the sidewalk . holloway , just reel yourself in a bit . come on. we 're moving along . things are looking up . okay , okay , you 're right . i quit smoking years ago . i just need to be occupied . talk then. have a conversation . what kind of doctor are you anyway ? uh , oh you know , I 'm the free kind . okay , chit-chat . chit-chat. um ... um , come on , help me . uh , tell me about your rug-rats . okay . we have three boys . nine , seven and five . oh , good god ! the poor woman. there 's no way I 'd survive that . yeah . she didn 't either . no , she 's not dead. she ... we 're just separated . uh , I 'm sorry . i can 't just shoot the breeze . these numbers aren 't prime . okay. clear . excuse me. sorry . you , uh , could try and help me out here , buddy . no I couldn 't . this one 's trapped too . we have to backtrack ? not yet . oh , no . read them to me . what are you ? his coat rack ? look , please . it 's stuck . look out ! this room is green . holloway . hl , there . this room is green . yes , it is . i wanna go back to the blue room . what is it ? shock or what ? i think he 's mentally handicapped . i like the blue room . jesus christ ! he almost broke my neck . hey , there , are you all alone ? do you want to hold my hand , honey ? butter first , then honey , kazan . butter first , then honey ... how 'd he survive ? i want to go back to the blue room . there 's lots of blue rooms. we 'll find you another one real soon . this is just way too bizarre . well you just worry about your numbers then . go on . I 'll look after him . safe , obviously , since he almost fell on my head . should we go for a walk ? kazan ? you want to go for a walk ? um , quentin ? let 's not make him do the climbing thing right away . holloway ! holloway . could they have taken us all the way to new mexico ? what are you talking about , holloway ? I 'm talking about where do you hide something this big ? at least he 's good for something . hey , I 'm sorry to shake your foundations , quentin , but you have no idea where your tax dollars go . free clinic doctors . only the military - industrial complex could afford to build something this size . holloway ? what is the military industrial complex ? have you ever been there ? I 'm telling you , it 's not that complex . how would you know from where you are ? who do you think the establishment is ? it 's just guys like me . their desks are bigger but their jobs aren 't . they don 't conspire . they buy boats . no , this place is ... remember scaramanga ? the bad guy in ' the man with the golden gun ' . yeah ? it 's some rich psycho 's entertainment . is that what you think ? clear ! okay . you 're a cop . single bullet theory . right on ! gas ! holloway ! get back here . it 's okay . i just swallowed my button . i hate this ! your boy 's having a conniption fit in there . it 's like cramming without coffee . she needs a break . she can do it . they all look prime to me . that your two-bits worth , worth ? for what it 's worth . well ? well , he 's right . they 're not prime . stop ! in front of you . what is it ? ow ! ow ! shut up ! i don 't know what happened . it wasn 't prime . quentin , hold still . somebody stop that racket . worth ! leave the boots . and shut the fucking door . i had a feeling about that fucking guy . he knew about that trap . but these numbers aren 't prime . then your number system failed. but he knew . knew what ? how would he know ? you 're the paranoid one . think about it . his only function so far has been to kick us when we 're down . so he has a bad attitude. are you saying that makes him a spy ? trust me on this. it 's my job to read people like an x-ray . he doesn 't like red rooms . so what happened ? you saw what happened . quentin . i guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought . maybe they mean nothing at all . no , it means they 're more involved . they 've worked for us up till now , haven 't they ? i just need some more time with them . well , we need to rest anyway . well , that 's handy , 'cause there 's not a fuck of a lot else we can do . are they telling you anything ? they 're not tarot cards . do you have any idea how many variables I have to consider before I can decipher numbers this size ? they don 't reveal themselves right away . they 're like people . oh , gross ! oh , not here , honey . over in the corner . well , he 's just peeing . jesus christ ! that 's excellent . now it totally reeks in here . you find this all pretty funny , don 't you ? what 's your fucking problem , worth ? even holloway 's holding up better than you . get over there and help her with him . that 's your job : babysitter . ja 'wohl , kommandant . somebody has to take responsibility around here . and that somebody has to be you . not all of us have the luxury of playing nihilist . not all of us are conceited enough to play hero . his is a will to live . everybody 's got it , worth , even you . especially you , hiding behind that cynical front . a will to live . that 's the warm , cosy feeling deep inside ? thanks , quentin , I 'm a new man . oh ! poor worth ! nobody loves me . if that 's the chip on your shoulder , why didn 't you just lie down and die ? do it . show us you have some backbone , and jump in the sushi machine . be a man . thought so . fuck you , quentin . i don 't wanna die . I 'm just being realistic . you think they 'd go to all this trouble if we could just walk out ? they would have left us clues and let us beat it so far , if there wasn 't a way out ? you think we matter ? we don 't . ah , put us out of your misery , so we can get out of here . - you 're not getting out of here . - yes , we are . no , you 're not . yes , we are . there is no way out of here . gotcha . how ... do you know that ? answer the question , worth . oh , god ! who are you ? I 'm the poisoner . i designed the outer shell . what ? the shell of the sarcophagus . you built this thing ? not this part , the exterior . i ... I don 't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here . i was contracted to draw up plans for a hollow shell . a cube . a cube ? why didn 't you tell us ? for god 's sakes , worth , you knew what it was . no . worth . you 're lying . it 's not a first . who 's behind it ? i dunno . who hired you ? i didn 't ask . i never even left my office . i talked to them on the phone ; other guys like me , specialists working on ... on small details . nobody knew what it was . nobody cared . bull shit ! you knew from square one . look at him . he 's up to his eyeballs in this thing . no , quentin . that 's how they stay hidden . you keep everyone separated , so the left hand doesn 't know what the right hand is doing . the brain never comes out in the open . whose brain ? it 's all the same machine , right ? the pentagon , multi - national corporations , the police ! if you do one little job , you build a widget in saskatoon , and the next thing you know , it 's two miles under the desert , the essential component of a death machine . i was right . all along , my whole life , I knew it . i told you , quentin . nobody 's ever going to call me paranoid again . we 've got to get out of here and blow the lid off this thing . holloway , you don 't get it . then help me please . i need to know . this may be hard for you to understand , but there is no conspiracy . nobody is in charge . it ... it 's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan . can you grasp that ? big brother is not watching you . what kind of fucking explanation is that ? it 's the best you 're gonna get . i looked , and the only conclusion I could come to is that there is nobody up there . somebody had to say , 'yes , ' to this thing . - what thing ? - only we know what it is . we have no idea what it is . we know more than anybody else . i mean , somebody might have known sometime before they got- - they got fired or voted out or sold it . but if this place ever had a purpose , then it got miscommunicated or ... or ... or lost in the shuffle . i mean , this is an accident ; a ... a forgotten perpetual public works project . do you think anybody wants to ask questions ? all they want is a ... is a clear conscience and a fat pay check . i mean , I leaned on my shovel for months on this one . this was a great job . why put people in it ? because it 's here . you have to use it , or you admit it 's pointless . but it ... it is pointless . quentin , that 's my point . what have we come to ? it 's so much worse than I thought . not really . just more pathetic . you make me sick , worth . i make me sick too . we 're both part of the system . i drew a box . you walk a beat . it 's like you said , quentin . just keep your head down , keep it simple , just look at what 's in front of you . nobody wants to see the big picture . life 's too complicated . i mean , let 's face it , the reason we 're here is that it 's outta control . this is how we ruin the world ? well , duh ! have you been on glue all your lives ? i felt guilty for ruining the world since I was like seven . god ! if you need someone to blame , throw a rock . well , I feel better . that 's why you stayed with us . to confess . still looking for someone to bust , quentin ? quentin , stop it ! stop it ! we need him . what for ? have you gone absolutely mad ? he 's the only one who knows anything about the place . worth . h-hi . so there 's this outer shell ? yeah . and it 's a cube , right ? like this ? i assume so . are there any doors ? there 's one door . where ? where the door guy put it . six guesses and it 's sealed from the outside . and what are the dimensions of the outer shell ? 434 feet square . may i ? come on , honey , slide over . 14 by 14 by 14 . the inner cube can 't be flush to the shell wall . i know that . there 's a space . one cube ? i don 't know . it makes sense . okay , well ... the biggest that the cube can be then is 26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so ... 17,576 rooms . 17,576 rooms ? oh , god . that makes me queasy . descartes . leaven , you are a genius . what ? what ? cartesian coordinates . of course. coded cartesian coordinates . they 're used in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph . in English ? slower . I 'm sure these numbers are markers . a grid reference like ... latitude and longitude on a map . the numbers tell us where we are inside the cube . well , where are we ? it works ! okay , um , all we have to do is add the numbers together . x-coordinate is 19 , y is ... 26 rooms . so that places us ... seven rooms from the edge . all right . let 's go . just out of curiosity , i mean , don 't hit me again or anything , but what are you going to do when you get there ? maybe we can get the door open . oh . what we need to do is figure out how to get around the traps . I 'm dealing with that , holloway . I 'm looking for practical solutions here . well , you haven 't found any yet . we 'll cut the risk , with the numbers and the boot . worth will go in first . no , he won 't , quentin . we take turns . relax . room for two in there ? what 's the matter ? these coordinates ; 14 , 27 , 14 . what about ' em ? well , they don 't make sense . assuming the cube is 26 rooms across , there can 't be a coordinate larger than 26 . if this were right , then we would be outside of the cube . no , not outside of the cube . oh. guess that means we 're not having dinner . trap. trap. trap. trap . trap. trap. trap . trap ! trap ! sound activated . boo ! lovely . how come the sound of the door opening didn 't set it off ? must be rigged to ignore it . holloway : so that 's it ? the edge is surrounded by traps . well , I guess we have to backtrack , and try somewhere else . who knows how many detours we 'll have to take . i say we cross the bitch . right ! ? how many boots do we have left , holloway ? get it off him . we know how it works . we just have to be quiet . that 's pretty fucking quiet . I 'm glad you 're on his side , worth , 'cause you 're up . and he 's not coming . of course he is . no way ! you 're not leaving him behind . he 's unpredictable . when we get to the edge we can come back for him , but he 'll get some - body killed here . am I right ? shame on you . will you look at yourselves ? what have you turned into ? they may have taken our lives away , but we 're still human beings . that 's all we 've got left . we 'll come back for him . that 's a lie and you know it . he 'll be quiet . ha ! you fucking fuck ! all right. that 's enough ! he 's a trap ! let him go right now . the law of the jungle , holloway , he 's endangering the pack . let him go , you nazi ! what did you call me ? quentin , you let that innocent boy go . you listen to me , woman . every day I mop up after your bleeding heart . the only reason you even exist is because I keep you . i know your type . no kids . no man to fuck you . so you go around outraged , sticking your nose up other people 's assholes , sniffing their business . you missed your boat , holloway . you 're all dried up inside there , aren 't you ? that 's your fucking problem . how dare you say that to her ? you don 't know her , quentin . none of us know each other here . oh ... I do . no , you don 't ! no wonder your wife left you . all that bottled up anger . and a thing for young girls . god help you , quentin . huh ! did you smack your kids around too ? is anybody besides me interested in what 's on the other side of that door ? open it . door number six , not number one , door number two ? open the fucking thing . sunshine . night time . my old friend the shell . it 's there . morning . morning. morning . hang on to me . can 't see shit . nothing to hang on to . we gotta try something . we gotta see if the door 's over there . someone has to swing over there and take a look . swing ? we make a rope ... out of clothes . take ' em off . I 'll tie it around myself . oh , yeah , you 're gonna go . you weigh like 500 pounds . it 'll snap in two seconds . I 'm the lightest . forget it . I 'll go . I 'm going , holloway . she 's right , quentin , you 're too heavy . I 'm the lightest after leaven . anyways , it 's my turn . how long did you know people were being put in here ? a couple of months . that 's not long , if you consider your whole life . i am . you opened my eyes , worth . that 's something . david . helen . you 're such a helen . that 's as far as you go . holloway : there 's nothing down here . hold tight . I 'll try swinging over there . brace yourselves . I 'm going to try again . okay . one more time . hurry ! you 're getting heavy . what the hell 's going on ? get up here now . quentin ! have you got her ? what 's going on ? quentin ? is she okay ? she , uh ... slipped . holloway ? hush. come on , kazan . kazan , will you please stop doing that ? leaven . you gotta be strong , sweetheart . don 't even talk to me . we gotta get down to the bottom . it 'll be easier to get on to the shell from there . it 's a long fucking way with only one boot , but we gotta do it before we get too weak . you gotta keep cracking the numbers , leaven . i can 't think any more . sure you can . it 's your gift . it 's not a gift . it 's just a brain . let her sleep for awhile . we haven 't slept in fuck knows how long . all right . one hour . how the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is ? an hour is as long as I say . what are you doing ? we have to make it down to the bottom . it 'll be quiet there and you can concentrate . you just wanna leave them ? they 're traps , leaven . we 're the key . I 'll get us down there . you 'll think us out . believe in me . try and see what I see ; how my mind works , the flash when I look into someone 's head , like a fucking x-ray . i looked through the walls . i dreamed him , at his desk , designing everything . yeah . he can 't let you solve the puzzle , see ? 'cause there is a purpose . we are the purpose . the cube ... is us . quentin ... we fit , like numbers . a man and a woman ; two halves of the equation . I 'll take you down ; the perfect key . I 'll slip you in the lock . leaven . it 's time to go down . getaway from her . leaven . they 're fucking spies : him , the retard . holloway had outside information about my family . but she slipped up , didn 't she ? she crossed the line . you dropped her . just go , quentin . give us the boot , you pig . you don 't want the boot . you want to come with us , worth ? down the hatch . what the fuck 's with him ? how did he ... ? it 's ... it 's ... it 's ' the wren ' . the old wrenster . how could ... ? we 're going in circles . that can 't be . where are we ? i don 't know . where are we ? you figure it out . you haven 't done anything . all you did was freak out , you ... murderer ! i guess you were right , worth . there is no way out of here . getaway from me . wasn 't rennes killed in that room ? how come there 's nothing out there ? it 's the edge . we weren 't at the edge before . where 's the room that killed rennes ? fuck off ! oh , that was good . what difference does it make ? we 're dead anyways . hey ! listen to what I 'm saying . there was a room there before . we haven 't been moving in circles . the rooms have . of course . the rooms . that explains the thunder and the shaking . we 've been shifting the whole time . it 's ... it 's the only logical explanation . I 'm such an idiot . what are you on to , leaven ? give me a minute . okay . the numbers are markers , points on a map , right ? right . and how do you map a point that keeps moving ? permutations . permu-what ? permutations . a list of all the coordinates that the room passes through . like a map that tells you where the room starts , how many times it moves , and where it moves to . a number tells you all that ? i don 't know . see , I 've only been looking at one point on the map , which is probably the starting position . all I saw was what the cube looked like before it started to move . okay , so it 's moving . how do we get out ? 27 ! i know where the exit is . where ? stay away from me . back off , quentin . i just want to know . don 't you want to know ? you remember that room we passed through before ? the one with the coordinate larger than 26 ? what about it ? that coordinate placed the room outside the cube . a bridge ! right . but only in its original position . what are you talking about ? uh ... look . the room starts off as a bridge . and then it ... it moves its way through the maze , which is where we ran into it . but at some point , it must return to its original position . so the bridge is only a bridge ... for a short period of time . this thing is like a giant combination lock . when the rooms are in their starting position , the lock is open . but when they move out of alignment , the lock closes . with a structure this size , it must take days for the rooms to complete a full cycle . so when does it open ? don 't . to find the original coordinates , the numbers are added together to find the permutations , then subtracted from one another . that 's it . this room moves to zero , one , and negative one on the x-axis , two , five and negative seven on y , and one , negative one and zero on z . what does that mean ? you suck at math . okay , I need the room numbers around us as a reference point . six , six , six . eight , nine , seven . four , six , six . five , six , seven . eight , nine , eight . okay ? yes . and five , four , five . did you get that ? six , five , six . seven , seven , eight . four , six , two . that 's enough . x is 17 , y is 25 , and z is 14 . which means this room makes two more moves before returning to its original position . do we have time ? maybe . then let 's go . can you work the traps for this system ? fuck the traps. let 's get to the bridge . well you threw out our last boot , you fucking idiot . technically I can identify the traps . technically ? i thought they were identified by prime numbers , they 're not . they 're identified by numbers that are the power of a prime . okay , so ? can you calculate that ? the numbers are huge . but you can , right ? yes , you can . I 'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set . maybe if I had a computer ... you don 't need a computer. yes , I do . figure it out . I can 't ! I 'm not dying in a fucking rat maze . look ! nobody in the whole world could do it mentally . look at the numbers : 567 , 898 , 545 . there 's no way I can factor that . i can 't even start on 567 . it 's astronomical . two . astronomical . what did you say ? astronomical . before that . factors ? how many factors , kazan ? of 567 ? two . what ? are you fucking kidding ? kazan , how many factors does 30 have ? three . how about seven ? one. gum drop . i don 't have any gum drops . gum drop . kazan ? I 'll give you a whole box of gum drops for each answer . gum drops come in bags . okay , you want ' em in bags , you got ' em in bags . i don 't like the red ones . eight , nine , eight . two . five , four , five. two . he 's giving us the factors . astronomical . you 're telling me telethon boy is a genius ? by those numbers , the room should be safe . only one way to find out . don 't ! the room is safe . kazan . my man . what 's the number , buddy boy ? hey ! right here . look here ! make him do it . kazan , we 're gonna do some numbers now , okay ? we like to do numbers , right ? prime numbers . that 's right . can you tell me the factor of 656 ? two . 779 ? t-two . 462 ? three . clear. move . come on . come on , let 's go . you too , worth . move your scrawny ass , worth . I 'm not through with you yet . leaven , open that door . get einstein working on the numbers . oh , gee . go ! worth ... hurry ! leaven . 563 . please , kazan , 563 . you fucker , you 're dead ! two . clear . one . trapped . check the floor . is he dead ? no. not quite . not even close ! when I get outta here , I 'll ... where is he ? come here . i said , ' come here , right ... ' got ya ! that way . two. clear ! four. clear ! oh ! well ... i guess that proves our theory . numbers . four. two . three. clear . kazan ! listen . he hasn 't moved far . I 'll go find him . what do you think ? you don 't have a lot of lives left . oh ! oh ! oh ! kazan ? i didn 't move . good. but you 're going to climb up here , okay ? i don 't like that . 14 , 26 , 14 . worth , get back here right now . five bags of gum drops . 27 bags total . 27 bags. deal . listen to me , worth . this room 's next move takes us to the bridge . we 're coming . over here . move it . we don 't have much time. come on . worth ? worth ! oh ! oh , this better be it . it ... it should be . where ? oh , well . give it a minute . be patient . so , guess what ? no ! this is the room we started in . i was right . we should never have moved in the first place . huh ! the bridge . red . kazan . four , two , four . clear . worth ? go ahead . what are you doing ? you can 't quit now . it 's not your fault . i have nothing to live for out there . what is out there ? the boundless human stupidity . i can live with that . no-o-o ! kazan , get out through the door . red , kazan .

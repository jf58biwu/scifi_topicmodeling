 Good day , Voyager , and welcome to A Briefing with Neelix . It 's a catchy title , isn 't it ? I 'll be coming to you each and every day with news of general interest , interviews with our fascinating crew members , musical performances , recommendations for new holodeck programs and , of course , previews of upcoming meals- - everything from Hlaka soup to Zabee nuts . A Briefing with Neelix will help you stay informed about ship 's activities , uh , keep you abreast of your colleagues ' accomplishments and broaden your knowledge about a wealth of subjects , but most of all , it will make you feel good because what you see here will always be the most uplifting , optimistic view of everything that happens on our ship . After all , as your morale officer , isn 't it my job to bring a little joy into everyone 's day , hmm ? Captain Janeway has agreed to appear on the show with regular updates about the ship 's progress and Commander Chakotay will commend outstanding crew members , so , snap to , and keep those boots polished to a shine . You never know when you might be featured on A Briefing with Neelix . Ready , Ensign ? All set , Neelix . In just a moment , an amazing talent . Ensign Pablo Baytart will astound you with his juggling ability . He 'll keep padds , hyposprays , even phasers in the air for minutes at a time . I don 't ... but before that , what makes people feel better than a little romance ? And what Lieutenant in a gold uniform was recently huddled in the Mess Hall with what crewman in blue having a very intimate conversation over a carafe of Silmic wine ? Well , I 'd never name names , but you know who you are . Best wishes to a handsome pair of lovebirds . And now , ladies and gentlemen , Ensign Pablo Baytart . Well ? What did you think ? I 'm a Doctor , not a performer . I don 't have time for such nonsense . I can see Hints for Healthful Living becoming a very popular segment , Doctor . I don 't think so . You 'd be lifted to a whole new level in the crew 's eyes . They 'd hang on your every word . You 'd enjoy a popularity , a celebrity that you 've never known before . I would ? You don 't have to answer right away . Just think about it . Ah ! Mr. Kim ! Just the person I wanted to see . See you later . Did you watch A Briefing with Neelix this morning ? Uh , yes . Yes , I did . is there something about the program you disliked ? I 'm not sure I care for all the frosting . Frosting ? Deck 4 . Recipes , music , jugglers- - it 's sort of like a steady diet of dessert , which is fine , but pretty soon , you want some meat and potatoes . You do ? When I was in school , I was editor of the Academy newspaper for a year . I monitored subspace transmissions . I got reports on some of the first activity by the Maquis against the Cardassians . I wrote an editorial about it , and the students became polarized on the issue . They debated the pros and cons and gained an insight into the entire history of the political rebellion . Now , that 's the power of journalism . What did your professor say when you told him you were going to publish the editorial ? I didn 't tell them . It 's the job of a journalist to be independent . Bridge to Mr. Neelix . You have an incoming transmission . I 'm heading for my quarters . Put it through there . Yes , sir . Neelix , my friend , how are you ? Laxeth , you old dilithium scrubber ! It 's good to see you . Calling to trade me some of your ill-gotten goods again ? I promise you I never want to see another wheel of Pendrashian cheese . Oh , those days are behind me . I 'm legitimate now . I 'm communications master of a Talaxian convoy . Communications master ... well , you 've certainly come up in the world . Congratulations . Looks like I 'll be seeing you in a few days . How 's that ? We 've been asked to rendezvous with your ship . We 're going to pick up a passenger . Passenger ? We don 't carry any passengers . Apparently , it 's a member of your crew . All I know is someone wants to leave your ship and come to work for us . Just how , exactly , did you hear that someone was leaving the ship ? An old friend of mine is serving with a Talaxian convoy . He told me they 'd be rendezvousing with us in a few days . Janeway to Tuvok . Yes , Captain ? Could you join us in my ready room , please ? Right away . Lieutenant , Mr. Neelix has heard on good authority that one of our crew will be leaving the ship in a few days . Naturally , he 's curious about the identity of this person . What are the security issues here ? I don 't believe there are any serious concerns , Captain . There is no need to withhold this information any longer . Lieutenant Paris ... has asked to be put off the ship . Tom ? I 'm sure you 're aware that he 's had some problems lately . Well , yes . He has been disruptive and often sets a bad example for the rest of the crew . But ... he seemed so determined to get those things behind him . It means a lot to him to be respected by this crew . All I can tell you is that when he was relieved of duty he asked me to make arrangements for him to leave the ship . I tried to talk him out of it , but he was adamant . We detected the Talaxian convoy and they were more than happy to get a pilot of Tom 's ability . I can 't believe this . I never thought ... Captain , may I speak with him ? Of course . He 's in his quarters . Come in . Hello , Tom . Neelix . How 's it going ? Not good , it looks like . What 's wrong ? I hear you 're leaving the ship . Good news travels fast , I guess . Yeah , I figured there was quite a bit more opportunity for advancement on a Talaxian convoy than there was on the only Starfleet ship in the Quadrant . When did you make this decision ? Truthfully ? Uh , about a minute and a half after I set foot on this ship a year ago . I knew it was a mistake to try to fit into Starfleet again and I should have listened to myself . A few more months in that rehab colony would have been a hell of a lot better than being here . Tom , you and I have had our differences , but I thought we put those behind us. I ... I just hope I haven 't ... contributed to your decision . Neelix , no . This isn 't about anybody except me . I 've done this to myself just like always . No matter where l go or who I 'm with , I make a mess of things . The unmistakable conclusion has to be that , deep down , I don 't want any friends or a family or a home . Otherwise , I wouldn 't keep sabotaging the possibilities . I thought you found those things here . I tried , or maybe I just told myself I was trying . I 'm not sure . Either way , it 's just not working . Frankly , I 'd like to get out before I completely destroy my image . There might actually be one or two people who still have a good opinion of me . I 'm one of them , Tom ... and I wish you wouldn 't go . Well , I thank you . But , the truth is , I 've always considered myself a drifter . You know what that 's like , Neelix . Freedom to do what you want , when you want . No rules to follow , nobody depending on you , right ? Well , there you are . I 've been waiting for what seems like hours . Doctor , what can I do for you ? I want to discuss the details of my participation on your program . I 've been giving it a great deal of thought and I 've come up with a number of ideas I think you 'll find quite intriguing . Well , that 's good news . l-l 'm delighted you 've decided to become a contributor , but I 'm afraid I don 't have time to discuss it right now . But I 've already prepared today 's topic : " How to keep your nostrils happy . " That is fascinating , but I 'm afraid there 's a more important story I have to work on today . You mean ... I 'm not going to appear today ? When you see it , I 'm sure you will understand . Hmm . But I will be on tomorrow ? Definitely . Without fail , I promise you . Very well , but tomorrow , I 'll want to cover two topics . I have a most entertaining idea . " Uncovering the hidden mysteries of the adrenal gland . " Fine , fine . Good-bye , Doctor . Good morning , Voyager . I want to tell you about a friend of mine . I first met this man almost a year ago , and , to tell you the truth , I didn 't like him much . He seemed a little too cocky , a little too sure of himself . A lot of people had questions about him . He 'd proven he 'd pretty much sell himself out to the highest bidder , go wherever the wind blew him . So people wondered : Could you trust this person when things got tough ? Would he stand side by side with you or would he let you down when you needed him most ? But the fact of the matter is , he proved himself right from the beginning . I wouldn 't be alive right now if it weren 't for him , and the same goes for many of you . It took me a while to realize it . Like a lot of people , I was too caught up in first impressions to see the truth that was right in front of me . I overlooked his bravery because I was focusing on his brashness . I ignored his courage because I saw it as arrogance , and I resented his friendliness because I mistook it for licentiousness . So while this man was giving us his best every minute of every day , I was busy judging him . And now , he 's leaving . I 'm proud to say that in spite of my narrow-mindedness , Thomas Eugene Paris became my friend . I 'm going to miss him . No more laughs over a game of pool . No more sitting up into the wee hours swapping stories . No more complaints about my cooking . Good-bye , Tom . I think I speak for more of us than you might imagine when I say you 're going to leave an empty space when you go . I hope you find what you 're looking for . Lieutenant , Operations has detected a minute increase in the engine core temperature . Are you aware of it ? Yes , Captain . There 's a slight imbalance in the magnetic constrictors . It 's causing the plasma stream to overheat . I have a team working on it . Keep me posted . Mr. Neelix , I 'm very pleased with your program , especially your tribute to Lieutenant Paris . Thank you . Captain , have you decided who 's going to replace Paris ? I have several people in mind . Baytart is one . Hamilton . Captain , do you think ... ? I mean , it 's possible Tom might change his mind , to come back . Maybe you shouldn 't replace him so quickly . Harry , Lieutenant Paris made his decision with no indication that he had any doubts about it or that he might change his mind in the near future . We have to accept that and move on . What 's our tactical status ? All systems are functional . Engineering to Torres . Go ahead . We have a problem here . What is it ? The magnetic constrictors have lost alignment . The plasma stream is way too hot . It 's starting to infect the injector valves . I 'm on my way . We 're finished here . Dismissed . Lieutenant , if I may ... this sounds like news of substance to me . Just stay out of our way . It 's gotten worse . I can 't get the injector valves closed . Antimatter is starting to seep into the warp core . Have you tried adjusting the power transfer conduits ? Yes . No effect . We have to try to contain the reaction in the core . Don 't let the PTC temperature get above 3.2 million kelvins . It 's at 2.9 million now . PTC temperature now at three million kelvins . We 're going to have to vent some plasma . If you vent plasma that hot through the nacelles , the warp coils are going to fry . Better that than a core breach . Reinforce the structural field around the power transfer conduits and then prepare to begin venting plasma . PTC temperature now 3.2 million kelvins ! It 's cascading . Get away from that console . I can stop it from here . Get away , Jonas ! Computer , initiate plasma venting . Are we all right ? PTC temperature is dropping , approaching safe levels . We 're under control . Neelix to Sick Bay . Prepare for emergency transport . We have three wounded . This one 's not badly hurt . 20 milligrams impedrezine . Vital signs steady . Second degree burns to face and chest . Treat him with the dermal regenerator . Ah . The situation has been stabilized . None of the victims is in danger any longer . May I interview one of them now ? One of the patients ? I 'd think you 'd be more interested in my assessment of the medical situation . Well , I am , of course . Would you care to make a statement ? Yes . The first task is to triage or to assess the relative condition of each of the victims and then to prioritize treatment accordingly . Thank you , Doctor . I 'm sure that will be of great interest to the crew . I wasn 't finished . Next , the treatment per se must be supervised . Very interesting . Now , I know the crew would love to hear a few words from the man who risked his life to save the ship . Would you consent to an interview ? I was just doing my job , Neelix . Lieutenant Torres is the one you should talk to . Janeway to Neelix . Right here , Captain . Could you join us on the Bridge , please ? I 'm on my way . I 'll contact you later about the interview . The plasma burst irradiated the engine nacelles . The inner layer of the warp coils was burned away . Which means the warp engines are useless until we can rebuild them . They 're made from a substance known as verterium cortenide . Do you know where we can find a source ? Verterium cortenide . If I 'm not mistaken , that 's a densified composite material . That 's right . It 's composed of polysilicate verterium and monocrystal cortenum . Do you know of any nearby source ? Let 's see . There 's a yellow dwarf system called Hemikek with an M-Class planet quite rich in minerals . Mining rights belong to a consortium of nonaggressive people . I 'm sure we could make arrangements to purchase some verterium and cortenum . Good work , Neelix . Captain , message coming in from the Talaxian convoy . Put it on screen . Captain Janeway . What 's happened ? We were attacked by the Kazon-Nistrim . Do you have casualties ? How can we help ? We have no serious casualties and they didn 't take any of our cargo . The one thing they were interested in was your former crewman , Thomas Paris . They took him aboard their ship and then left . I thought you 'd want to know . Tom Paris ... Hello , Seska . You 're looking radiantly maternal . In another month , Chakotay will have a son ... or a daughter . I really didn 't want to know which . Makes it more interesting , don 't you think ? I wouldn 't know . I have no idea which one Chakotay would prefer . He and I rarely see eye to eye . You 've had your problems with him lately , too . I know all about what 's happened . Your sudden inability to be Starfleet 's good boy . It 's not sudden . I never really fit in there . Then " Lieutenant Tom Paris " was just a pretense . No . No , it was me trying very hard to be someone I finally couldn 't be . I never liked you , Tom . I didn 't trust you . I don 't trust you now . I can assure you the feeling is mutual . Fine . But we might be able to help each other ... if you 're telling the truth . is that why you kidnapped me and dragged me here , so we can be pals now ? I thought it might make sense to you . And if it doesn 't ? The Kazon tend to be excessive in their use of force . It 's nothing I can change . But I can promise you 'll be well-treated on this ship if we decide we can work together . What exactly would that mean ? You 're an excellent pilot . We could make good use of your skills , and , of course , you have information about Voyager that could be quite valuable . It seems to me like you 're already getting a lot of valuable information about Voyager from somewhere . Think about it , Tom . Think about where you want to be when the Nistrim seize Voyager and start taking control of the Quadrant sector by sector . Just let me know . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49485.2 . In spite of the fact that Tom Paris has been abducted by the Kazon , we must continue on course for the Hemikek system . Something just doesn 't make sense . I mean , he wasn 't off the ship for a day when the Kazon attacked that convoy . How did they find out so fast that Tom was there ? Maybe someone on the convoy told them . A Talaxian convoy would never let the Kazon know where they are . That would be like committing suicide . Maybe they came to rob the cargo , but when they realized there was a Starfleet officer ... That wouldn 't have stopped them from taking the cargo , too . And according to my friend , Laxeth , it was a swift , efficient strike . It sounds like they knew Tom was there and they came just to get him . But who would have told them ? One possibility I can think of is that it was someone on this ship . On Voyager ? . Who would do that ? I don 't know ... but a responsible journalist would find out . B 'Elanna , I didn 't expect to find you here . Are you working the night shift ? I have been since the accident . What brings you here ? I was wondering if you could show me how to access the subspace communications logs ? Why would you be interested in the com logs ? Well , just part of my news program . Well , I can get you into them , but then you 're on your own . I 'm still trying to bring the magnetic constrictors into alignment . I understand . Just get me started . How far back do you want to go ? Oh , maybe a month or two . Okay , the file 's open . Transmissions are logged on by date and time . Anything else ? No , I 'll be fine . Thank you very much . Mike , we 're going into the computer core to look over the magnetic constrictor circuitry . Hold down the fort . All right ? Okay , Lieutenant . Voyager to Mithren . Mithren again . Voyager to Kotati ... Are you looking for something in particular ? I don 't know exactly what I 'm looking for . Something anomalous . Why ? An incident I 'm investigating . Tell me , Mr. Hero , if someone wanted to make a secret subspace transmission , how would he do it ? Why would you want to know that ? Oh , I can 't be too forthcoming right now , but if I find what I think I 'm going to , well , let me just say that this ship will be stunned . A secret transmission , huh ? Well , that would be tough , Neelix . There are all kinds of security routines in place and any time a subspace antenna array is in use , the sensors make a record of it . I 'm not seeing anything anomalous here . What about that ? What ? That ... gap . As if some of the log entries have been deleted . Well , that 's just a data fragmentation . I beg your pardon ? It probably happened when the plasma overloaded the system . Little glitches like this will be popping up for weeks , I 'd imagine . Here it is again . I wouldn 't worry about it . Maybe Lieutenant Torres can explain it . There 's nothing to explain . Believe me , Neelix , you 're making too much of it . Ah ! Here it is again . Gaps in the log entries . And , frankly , it looks like more than data fragmentation to me . The gaps are showing up in logs entered over the last month but not before that . So , there you are ! I 've been looking for you , Mr. Neelix . Doctor , how can I help you ? You again neglected to include me in your news program . If you remember , I was to have two segments today because I was excluded yesterday . That 's right , that 's right . I 've been so preoccupied with this other matter . In the interest of time , I 'm willing to forego my story on the adrenal gland . I will concentrate instead on my latest idea " The Klingon Glottis : Friend or Foe ? " That 's very interesting , but we 're going to have to put it off until tomorrow . That 's what you said yesterday . I 'm sorry , Doctor , but I really have to go now . All through the subspace communication logs , there were these gaps as though something had been erased . We have recently experienced a plasma overload . That could easily account for the anomalous readings in the logs . Aha ! I knew you 'd say that . Answer this , Mr. Vulcan : Why would those gaps , those deletions occur only in the sub com logs and only in the last month ? I checked every log system we have- - sensor logs , power allocation logs , warp maintenance logs , environmental control logs . They 're all perfectly fine . What are you suggesting ? I believe someone on this ship has been making covert transmissions and erasing the evidence . To what end ? I don 't know , but I suspect whoever it was has been communicating with the Kazon . That 's an extremely serious charge . I know . That 's why I 've come to you . Mr. Neelix , I strongly suspect that your enthusiasm for your new journalistic endeavor is leading you to see villains where none exist . However , even the possibility that someone on board might secretly be communicating with the Kazon deserves investigation . I will pursue the matter . And I will help you . I think not . This is now a matter of ship security . I must ask you to withdraw and let me handle it according to Starfleet protocols . As a journalist , I have an ethical obligation to keep digging for the facts in this case . And I have the higher obligation to keep you from putting yourself and others at risk . You will drop this matter . I see . All right , I leave it in your hands . Good hunting . " A higher obligation " ? Ha. I 'll show him higher obligation . He 'll have Eskarian egg on his face when I get to the heart of this . It 's the job of a journalist to be independent . Lieutenant , I wonder if you could ... I 'm a little busy right now , Neelix . What do you need ? I was wondering if it 's possible to look underneath a log that seems to have been erased , see if there 's anything left of it . Mr. Hogan , could you please help Neelix out for a minute ? You want to recover deleted logs ? Uh , that would be ideal . Well , let me give it a try . Usually it 's possible to recover data unless extraordinary measures were taken to erase it . Well , this is strange . Computer , run a signal modulation analysis of this file . Security authorization required . Engineering authorization : omega-four-seven . Authorization accepted . Running analysis . What ? I ... can 't recover the logs because these messages were sent without using any of the antenna arrays . How could someone do that ? By sending the transmissions through the ship 's power grid . The messages were encoded in the waste energy from the propulsion systems , which is almost indistinguishable from galactic background noise . Ingenious . Would there be a way to determine who sent the messages ? I 'm looking for signal correlation traces . They 'd indicate a com link to the EPS conduits- - maybe give us a location . I don 't know if I can ... There . There 's one . The source of the com link is on Deck 4 , Section 3-C . Sorry , but I can 't get more specific than that . Mr. Hogan , I need your help over here . Thanks for your help . I 'll check out Deck 4 . Go room by room , console by console . I 'd look for evidence of recent deletions . If you see any , run a recovery program . See what you get . Computer , activate monitor . Unable to comply . Monitor is cleared for Lieutenant Thomas Paris only . Override existing clearance . Engineering authorization : omega-four-seven . Authorization accepted . Files recovered . Unbelievable . My friends , I derive no satisfaction from what I am about to tell you . I know I originally promised you that I would only bring you good news . However , I feel it 's important that you know the truth . I have uncovered evidence that casts serious doubt on the loyalties of Lieutenant Thomas Paris . I have discovered secret communications to the Kazon that were sent from his quarters just prior to his leaving the ship . Get him up here ... now . ... of messages sent to the Kazon for some weeks before his departure . How did you trace those transmissions to Tom 's quarters ? It was , uh ... I believe it was called signal correlation traces . Mr. Hogan was helping me , and he detected them . When I looked for signal correlation traces , there were none . That means someone placed them in the system after my initial investigation . What initial investigation ? Captain , what 's going on ? What I 'm about to say will come as a surprise to you , Commander . There has been a spy aboard Voyager , but it isn 't Tom Paris . It isn 't ? No . Lieutenant Paris is , in fact , part of our plan . Plan ? Some weeks ago , Tuvok discovered evidence of covert transmissions leaving Voyager through the EPS system . We realized there was someone on this ship communicating with the Kazon-Nistrim . However , we were unable to ascertain who that person was . We needed a way to flush out the spy and we had exhausted all conventional means . That 's when we thought of using Tom , finding a way to get him on the Kazon ship . Are you saying Paris' insulting behavior , the gambling , being late for duty , mouthing off at me , was all a ruse ? That is correct . It was important that his decision to leave the ship appear plausible , so he began behaving like a malcontent . And the reason I wasn 't let in on this little plan ? I was the one who recommended to Captain Janeway that you not be told . I suspected that the spy was a Maquis and felt it was wrong to put you in a position of setting a trap for someone who had once served under you . In other words , you didn 't trust me . Commander , the simple fact is we needed a good performance . I 'm afraid we used you to help Tom provide it , and you did a damn good job . Now , it seems Mr. Neelix 's investigation has made someone nervous- - nervous enough to put a trail in the computer system for him to follow . Could it be Hogan ? I don 't think so . He was just the person walking by who Lieutenant Torres asked to help me . The spy may be a little cozy now , since you took the bait and pointed the finger at Tom , but we don 't want him cozy . I 'd rather he feel some pressure . Perhaps we should take advantage of Mr. Neelix 's unintentional blunder . Exactly. I want you to keep investigating , Neelix . Do what you 've been doing- - poke around , ask questions- - but let people think you 're not so sure you were right about Tom Paris . That would put Neelix in a potentially dangerous situation . We would keep an open com link to you at all hours . My security team could act immediately if anything were to happen . It 's up to you , Neelix . This is purely voluntary . Anything I can do to help , Captain , and get Tom home safely , I want to do . What did you expect ? ... think this has all been about exchanging holiday greetings ? No , of course not , but ... Here 's how it 's going to work . We 'll be waiting for you on a planet called Hemikek iv . Well , Tom , it 's always good to have one 's instincts verified . Clever plan , Seska , leading Voyager into an ambush , but even so , this ship will be outmanned and outgunned . That 's why we have ground troops on Hemikek and more ships on the way . Now , don 't you wish you 'd taken my offer ? Thanks for the hospitality . Go get him ! Lieutenant Torres is waiting for these interlink sequencers . Get them to her right away . Yes , sir . Excuse me . Oh , hello , Neelix . I was wondering if one of you could help me . We 're a little busy right now . What is it that you need ? The signal correlation traces that implicated Tom Paris- - they were added to the file after the fact . You 're kidding ? So , I was trying to figure out how that could have happened and who might have done it . This couldn 't be a worse time , Neelix . We 're getting everything ready for rebuilding the warp coils . Do you mind if I use the diagnostic terminal over there ? Go ahead , just don 't tap into any Engineering systems . I 'll be careful . Torres to Engineering . Jonas here , Lieutenant . I need the electrodynamic load specs . They weren 't with the other things you sent . Sorry , Lieutenant . I 'll get them to you right now . Take these to Lieutenant Torres . Right . What 's going on ? Bridge to Engineering . Jonas here , Captain . I need you to increase transporter range . Shunt all available power to Transporter Room 2 . Right away . Let me know as soon as you 've done it . We have an incoming shuttle and we 've identified human life signs . It may be Tom Paris . Yes , ma 'am . Paris to Voyager ! Paris to Voyager ! Do you read me yet ? Paris to Voyager ! Paris to Voyager ! Come in ! Voyager to Paris . We hear you . Captain , change your course immediately . The Kazon have ground troops waiting for you on Hemikek , and more ships on the way . We 'll get you out of there as soon as we can , Tom . You 're still out of transporter range , but we won 't change course until we 've locked on to you . I can take care of myself ! Just get Voyager to safety ! As soon as you 're on board . Tom , what happened ? Are you all right ? Lieutenant Paris , report . Mr. Jonas , we need that transporter now . I 'm working on it , Captain . I 'm having trouble resetting the EPS manifold . Stay on it . Mr. Jonas , I 'm no expert , but it doesn 't look to me like you 're working on the transporter subsystems . Neelix , I know what I 'm doing . What did you do ? ! What is this force field for ? It 's just a precaution . Please , Neelix ! Stay out of this ! Tom , can you hear me ? Report . I 'm here , Captain . We 'll be in normal transporter range in another minute . Captain ... the spy . It 's Michael Jonas . He 's the one that sabotaged the ship . Noted . Janeway to Tuvok . Get to Engineering immediately . It 's Michael Jonas . On our way . Shuttle hull starting to breach . Might not make it , Captain . I recognize that subroutine . You 're into the weapons system . You 're disabling them ! For God 's sakes , Neelix , back off . Neelix to ... We 're in transporter range , Captain . Voyager to Paris . Tom , can you hear me ? We 're energizing now . Transporter Room 2 , do you have him ? We have him , Captain . He 's all right . It 's the Kazon ship , Captain . Return fire . Janeway to Tuvok , are you in Engineering yet ? The doors are sealed . We 're working on it , Captain . Bridge to Transporter Room 2 . Lock on to Mr. Jonas in Engineering and beam him out of there . Aye , Captain . All I got was his combadge , Captain . Captain , we 've lost weapons . It looks like the phaser arrays have been disabled from Engineering . Evasive maneuvers , Ensign . Mr. Kim , get those weapons back on line . Weapons are back on line , Captain . Fire at will . Yes , ma 'am . Are you injured ? Don 't worry about me , Mr. Vulcan . I 'm perfectly all right . Unfortunately , Mr. Jonas wasn 't so lucky . Bridge to Tuvok . I 'm standing down Red Alert . Well , I 'm going to have plenty of material for tomorrow 's Briefing with Neelix . ... and fortunately , I was able to steal one of the Kazon shuttles and escape . An amazing story . Amazing . Now , I 'd like to say something more , if I might . Of course . Um , I know that I 've been acting like a jerk for the last couple of months . Unfortunately , I had to behave that way if the spy was going to believe that I really wanted to leave the ship , so I 'd like to apologize to anyone that I might have offended ... uh , especially Commander Chakotay . I gave him a pretty hard time . Not that it wasn 't a certain amount of fun , mind you . Well , there you have it , ladies and gentlemen , the true hero of this whole endeavor- - Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris . Well , I 'm afraid that 's all the time we have . Oh , I 'd like to apologize to the Doctor for not getting around to him once again today , but I promise you , he 'll be here tomorrow with lots of fascinating information about the Bolian digestive system . Good day , Voyager .

 25.000 Oh , gosh , go home , Harold . I 'm not done yet . Harold , you hear me ? You should 've gone home already . I 'm not done yet . For cryin ' out loud , Harold . This ain 't so difficult . I 'm not done yet ! Harold , it 's past your bedtime . It 's OK . And the doctors 'll be worried about you . You did a good job today . Now you go home . Come on . 37 , 45 63 , 71 86 , 92 ... ( clanking ) What the hell ? Jeez ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh ! I 'll get help ! ( siren ) ( siren ) Officer ! Officer ! Go on , sir . This don 't involve you . There 's a woman inside . She 's bleeding . She 's ... God ... That 's her ! That 's the girl I saw . Yes ! Hey , Scully ! Take a look at this . - What am I looking at ? - The pinsetter . See the way it 's broken ? Yeah . Mr Pintero said that would only happen if considerable weight was placed on it . - This is where you saw the body ? - Yes , ma 'am . She was caught up in the machinery . Her neck was cut . And the blood from the victim was pooling where ? Right here . But both the body and the blood were gone when you returned ? Yeah . But , like I said , the woman in the parking lot ... Was the same woman you saw caught up in the machinery ? That 's right . Look , I 'm not making this up . - No one 's suggesting that you are . - I saw the look on her face . Can I ask a favour ? Can I get a soda ? - A cola ? Something like that ? - Sure . Yeah . What is that look , Scully ? After four years , you know exactly what that look is . You don 't believe in ghosts ? You 're saying that what this man saw was the victim 's ghost ? Sounds more like a disembodied soul . Which is just another name for a ghost . Except , according to Mr Pintero , this one was trying to communicate . She was speaking as if she was trying to tell him something . It sounds more like a death omen . - A death omen ? - Yeah . It 's a spirit being that arrives as a harbinger of death . This is the third reported sighting in as many weeks . And as many murders . Each time the victim appearing near the crime scene trying to communicate . - Communicate what ? - I don 't know yet , but ... Thank you . If you hold on a second , I may have an answer for you . Hey ! What are you doin ' ? - She is me . - What ? Written onto the wax . She is me . Look at this . Three victims . All women . All approximately the same age , height , weight , hair and eye colour . All attacked within the same six-block area of each other . Our FBI profiling model suggests a white male , late 20s , early 30s . His victims were probably strangers to him . Symbols representing other women in his life . Perhaps all women . Hey , you , in the back . Are we boring you ? No , not at all . Because if you have nothing to contribute ... I think that following the FBI model in this case will not only fail to turn up the killer but will lead to more victims and more deaths . You wanna tell us who you are and what you base that on ? I 'm Special Agent Mulder . This is Agent Scully , FBI . We 're following up a lead that seems to have been dropped . - A statement made by the proprietor ... - The guy who claims he saw the victim . No , no , not the victim . Her apparition . What the Irish call a fetch . What is more commonly known as a wraith . Oh ! OK . Were there any written messages in the other cases ? Written messages ? Do the words she is me have any meaning to you ? - You mean Penny Timmons ' last words . - Those were her dying words ? - According to a 911 call we received ... - Who made that call ? - A nut . - What do you mean ? There were no dying words . Penny Timmons ' larynx was severed . She couldn 't cry for help even if there was help to cry for . - And no one followed up on this lead ? - No . But , uh I 'll have someone get you the number and you can follow up on it . I 'd appreciate that . People ? People ? Listen up now . I 've brought some folks who wanna talk with you . - Nurse Innes , could you gather the group ? - All right , everyone . You know the drill . Group seating . Go on in . Harold ? Come on . Harold . - Good morning , everybody . - Good morning , Mr Alpert . I 've brought visitors today . They 're investigating a crime . It 's OK . They just wanna ask you a few questions . Hi . I wanted to ask if anybody used the payphone out in the hallway on Friday night . Because somebody called the police and reported a murder . ( whispers ) Sloppy Joe night . That was Sloppy Joe night . Ooh ! That was me . I did it . I admit it . I did it . I 'm just a human being after all . Chuck , tell the truth . Nah . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean it . I lied . I lied , but ... I 'm just a human being . Has anyone used the payphone to call the police ? Does anybody recognise this woman ? ( Chuck ) That 's the lady that got murdered . - ( man ) She 's the one . - ( woman ) I recognise her . - I know her . - She was murdered . And does anybody recognise this man ? - Yes . Yes , he did it . - He did it . - He 's the murderer . - He 's a very funny man . He smiles a lot . - The quiet man in the back . - Harold Spuller ? The only one who didn 't raise his hand . Has he ever been a problem ? No ! He has a tendency to get a little worked up . - Do you think I can talk to him ? - Yeah , sure . I think I found something here , Mulder . In these photos taken by the forensics team the third victim , her left hand , that band of pale skin ? - It looks like she wore a ring . - A wedding ring . But she wasn 't married . - So , what , he stole her ring ? - No , not at all . ( Mulder ) He switched it . And in all the other murders he repeated the same ritual changing the ring on each victim . Nice catch , Scully . Any idea about the psychology ? There 's ego-dystonia , a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder where a person has the persistence and impulses to change things , to organise , to reorganise . It 's not ordinarily something that escalates to a murderous impulse . Unless there was a more complex psychology at work like pronounced mental illness . - You think the killer is a patient here ? - I 'm not sure the killer is here . The person that made that phone call is . I think it 's Harold Spuller . - Did he cop to making the call ? - No . But he 's about to . I don 't know anything . I didn 't do anything . Leave me alone . You made that phone call , didn 't you , Harold ? No . Did you say the words she is me ? No . Have you ever heard those words ? No ! Have you ever seen a ghost , Harold ? No . No . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No , no , no , no , no ! No , no , no ! No , no , no ! - Please leave me alone ! - Harold ! Leave me alone ! No , no , no , no ! - No , no , no , no , no ! - Harold , listen to me . When you 're right , you 're right . 17 , 30 , 37 , 45 , 53 . Harold suffers from pervasive developmental disorder sometimes called atypical autism . He has spent his entire life in and out of facilities just like this one . He has been medicated , has received shock therapy and has been diagnosed with ego-dystonic obsessive-compulsive disorder which would explain the switching of the rings . - So why all of a sudden ? - You mean what made him snap ? His outburst showed an impulse towards violence when put in a challenging situation . That didn 't come until after I 'd asked if he 'd ever seen a ghost . Mulder , the man is disturbed . You could see the pressure building from the moment the interview began . Yeah . Why are you unconvinced that Harold is the man we came looking for ? I 'm sure he made that phone call . But what led us to him still remains unexplained . She is me ? And the other apparitions , like the one Mr Pintero saw . I have an idea about that , if not an explanation . Harold Spuller is at this facility voluntarily . He can come and go as he pleases . To kill those women , or to hold down ajob . Or both . Oh , Scully ... - Yeah ... it 's OK . - You sure ? Yeah , it 's just ... I 'm fine . I just need to find a washroom . ( moaning ) ( Mulder ) Scully ? Scully , you in there ? Yeah . They found another victim . A student with her throat cut just about half a block from here . ( siren ) Her name was Lauren Heller , age 21 . She was single . She was on her way home from a bar that she part-timed at after school . She had a ring on her left hand . It was switched to her right hand . Pinkie finger . She was dead less than an hour when she was found . - That would rule out Harold as the killer . - No , it doesn 't . He 's not at the home . His nurse locked him in his room after we left , but he managed to escape unnoticed . I don 't imagine he 'd be too hard to find . Yeah , but we should be the ones to find him , if only to find out what she is me means . Mulder ... What ? I think I 'm gonna let you take care of that . I think I 'm gonna get this checked out . Just to be safe . - You want me to drive you ? - No , no , no . I 'm fine , really . I 've had the doctors keep a close watch . This is just a precaution . - You 're sure ? - I 'm fine . 9 , 17 , 26 , 32 ... ( Harold mumbling numbers ) ( Harold still mumbling numbers ) No . No . I just wanna be left alone . ( doctor ) We 've spoken about your fear . You 've been afraid to express it to others . To Agent Mulder . - This is different . - How ? Several months ago I was diagnosed with a cancerous mass . A nasal pharyngeal tumour that cannot be operated on and cannot be treated by conventional medicine . I 'm sorry . I don 't mean for this to sound too dire . My health has been good . I have been checked up on a weekly basis . - You 've kept working ? - Yes . It 's been important to me . Why ? Why ? Um ... Agent Mulder has been ... concerned . He 's been supportive through this time . Do you feel that you owe it to him to continue working ? No . I guess I never realised how much I rely on him before this . His passion . He 's been a great source of strength that I 've drawn on . What happened last night , Dana ? I saw something . And I don 't know what to trust . If I saw it because of the stress . Because the image had been suggested to me . Or if it was a suggestion of my own fears . Your fear of failing him ? Maybe . What did you see ? I saw a woman who had recently been murdered . But I saw her . It appeared as if she was trying to tell me something . Do you know what ? No . Are you sure ? - Hey , you 're back . - Yeah . I 'm looking for Harold Spuller . Harold ? What for ? - Suspicion of murder . - You think Harold killed those women ? - You obviously don 't think so , huh ? - Harold 's worked for me for ten years . He might be crazy , but he couldn 't kill anyone . - He 's a sweet kid . - You know where he is now ? He was here this morning when I arrived , arranging the shoes . He has a key ? No , he 's got some damn way of gettin ' in here through an abandoned building next door . - Did you ever get lane six working ? - No . Not since I saw the girl . Harold ? Harold ? Harold , I just wanna talk to you . Harold ? ( Harold mumbling ) She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . ( mumbling continues ) She is me . She is me . She is me . Harold ? She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . 8 , 17 , 30 , 37 . I wanna make this clear from the start . My client is suffering from a mental disorder . He will not answer questions regarding his guilt or innocence . I 'd be real happy if he 'd quit talking right now . Any time Harold becomes upset or unwilling to cooperate , this interrogation will end . Detective Hudak ? Tell me why you did it , Harold . Tell me why you killed those women . What did I just say ? This is totally unacceptable . I am prepared to tell my client not to cooperate . Harold ? Harold , you knew those women who were murdered , didn 't you ? That 's why you 're scared . You 're afraid they 've come back to visit you . - Penny Timmons . - 8 , 17 , 30 37 , 45 , 53 , 71 80 , 92 , 99 , 108 ... - Mrs Schipiro . - 14 , 29 38 , 57 , 71 , 79 , 88 101 , 117 . - Michelle Chamberlain . - 17 , 32 49 , 69 , 78 87 , 99 . What was her shoe size ? - Six and a half . - There you have it . - This is not a confession . - He killed ' em . - Harold , I advise you not to respond . - He fixated on ' em ... - ... and he slit their pretty little throats . - Nor to cooperate any further . There are people who think you murdered these women . I 'm not one of them . But I need your help for me to prove that . You think you can do that ? I think you can . Mr Pintero , I 'd like to search the building for any ways in or out that Harold might know . - Sure . - Thanks . You OK , Harold ? The shoes are out of order , Mr Pintero . I 'm sorry . Hey , it 's OK , buddy . Don 't you worry about it . Get this straightened out with these folks , then come and keep me in line . OK , Mr Pintero . ( Harold mumbling numbers ) I wanna know why we 're being led around like this . I 'm hoping it 'll become clear to us when we find it . Is that right ? He 's gonna show us something that 's going to exonerate him ? I think so . Here . Here what ? My God . They 're all here . Every victim . - ( attorney ) This proves nothing . - He fixated on them . I see hundreds of scorecards up here . Thousands of names . Choose a name . Pick a name . Pick any name up there . Fred Graham . 17 , 42 , 67 , 88 107 , 122 131 , 166 178 , 201 . 200 game . That 's not bad . - He has all these scores in his head ? - Including the victims ' . ( attorney ) You said this proves his innocence . How ? - I 'm not sure exactly , but I think that ... - No ! No ! No , no , no ! ( Harold crying ) Breathe ! One , two , three , four , five . Breathe ! He just keeled . Fell right over . I 've done all I can . ( Harold wailing ) Must 've been a heart attack . ( doorbell ) Hey , Scully . Is it too late ? No . What are you doing , Mulder ? I need your help on something . I need your medical expertise . - On what ? - Harold Spuller . Oh ! I 'm sorry , I didn 't even ask you . What did your doctor say ? - I 'm fine . - Good . - What 's up , Mulder ? - Angie Pintero , the bowling-alley guy ? - He 's dead . - How ? Natural causes . Heart failure . Just keeled over in the bowling alley . - You need my medical opinion on that ? - No . Harold Spuller had a premonitory vision of his boss 's death . - I don 't understand . - He saw an apparition . Pintero 's disembodied soul at the moment of orjust prior to his death . - How do you know ? - I was there when he saw it . - But you didn 't see it yourself ? - No . - Why ? - I don 't have that facility . That connection to the victims that would make a vision possible . What 's Harold 's connection ? I don 't know , but I think it 's to do with his autism . That he had a profound attachment to these victims but was unable to express the depth and power of those relationships . So somehow a psychic bond was formed that went beyond the temporal . - Harold knew the people that were killed ? - Yeah , from the bowling alley . Harold wasn 't the only one who claims to have seen these apparitions . But he has something in common with those who 've had the visions that is powerful in its own right . - Which is what ? - They were all dying . One of emphysema , one of cancer and , uh ... now Angie Pintero . - Harold Spuller 's dying too ? - That 's what I need your medical opinion on . - Well , what if he isn 't ? - I would be very surprised . What is a death omen if not a vision of our own mortality ? And who among us would most likely be able to see the dead ? Harold 's at the resident home right now . I 'll meet you there . ( Alpert ) Harold ? Agent Mulder will be sending a doctor to examine you . Well , you 're back . It 's gonna be all right now , Harold . They just want us to keep you here for a little checkup . There 's nothing to worry about . Thanks , Officers . All right , Chuck . Go to bed . You can see Harold in the morning . See ? Everyone 's so glad to see you back , Harold . You can talk to Chuck in the morning . You still have to take your meds , though . Keeps you flyin ' straight and level . 80 , 88 , 92 , 99 . Come on . It 's the way we always do it . 78 ... 87 ... Attaboy . Good stuff . - Lucas brought him back . - Is he acting up ? No . I think he 's just a little scared . I 've been tryin ' to get him to take his meds . 14 , 29 , 37 . Why don 't you let me sit with him for a bit ? OK . Sure . Take your poison , Harold . Go on . What you got to live for now , huh ? What did you tell them , Harold ? Did you tell them about your little girlfriends ? Huh ? - Did you tell them how you were in love ? - No ! Did you show them your pictures ? No . What do you think those girls thought of you , Harold ? Do you think they loved you back ? No one could love you , Harold . Look at yourself . They looked at you and saw an ugly toad . A retard . - Agent Mulder . - Thanks for accommodating us again . Not a problem . We 're all concerned for Harold . You 're bringing a doctor ? Agent Scully 's a doctor . If you could have Harold 's medical records available ... ( scream ) Oh ! What 's happened to you ? Oh ! Don 't touch that . Don 't touch that . It 's just a cut . He just went wacko . I was tryin ' to get him to take his meds and he went berserk . He jumps me , starts pounding me like he wants to kill me . Did he say anything ? No , he just started screaming like a lunatic . Something 's gone wrong with him . I think he 's lost it for good . I 'll be damned if I 'm gonna take care of him any more . I think you should get this cut on your head looked at . Maybe just give me a few minutes to get my nerves back . OK , everybody , everything 's fine now . Come on , back to bed . That 's right , dear . Go on now . We 'll see you in the morning . Night-night , everybody . - What can I do to help ? - Call the police . Ask for Detective Hudak . Tell him to look for Harold down at the bowling alley . - Are they gonna arrest him ? - I don 't see any way around that . Sorry . Maybe you were wrong . That 's a superficial head wound . He didn 't mean to kill her , or maim her . - That 's not the work of a murderer . - Then why would he do it ? Maybe he 's sicker than we thought . Maybe . We won 't know until we can examine him . There 's someone you can talk to . Why don 't you talk to his roommate , and I 'll see what I can do about finding Harold . Oh , hi . - Is your name Chuck ? - Yes . Yes , it is . Chuck Forsch . F-o-r-s-c-h . Chuck Forsch . - Do you share this room with Harold ? - Yes . He 's my friend . - Do you know where he is ? - He 's dying , isn 't he ? - Harold is dying . - Why do you say that ? Nurse Innes . She 's ... she 's trying to poison him . - Who told you that ? - Harold . He said she told him she was putting poison in his meds . - Harold hasn 't been taking his medication ? - I don 't know . I don 't know everything . I 'm only a human being . But I do know that ... that Harold 's my friend . He wouldn 't hurt anybody . You know he really loved them . Who ? Harold ... he gave them to me . He was afraid . Does anybody else know about these pictures , Chuck ? Nurse Innes . - How are you feeling ? - I 'm ... you know , shaky . Understandable . Working with these people , it starts driving you crazy too . I 'm looking forward to going home . - Will your family be a comfort ? - I live alone . - No children ? - Just the one my husband ran off with . Nurse Innes , I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to ask you to step out into the hallway . Stay where you are ! Drop it ! Let it go ! ( gunshot ) She 's alive . Let 's get a paramedic in here . Yeah . - You 're cut . - Yeah , she attacked me . You might wanna bag that . I 'm pretty sure it 's the murder weapon . She had been taking Harold 's meds , clonazepam and clozapine the effects of which are violence and unpredictable behaviour . But why did you suspect her ? Harold 's roommate said that Harold thought she had been poisoning him . So I went in to confront her and she just went off . - Why would she kill those women ? - I don 't know . Maybe in some drug-addled way she was trying to kill happiness . Harold 's happiness . His love for those women . Maybe trying to destroy something she thought she 'd never have again . She is me . - Have they found Harold ? - Yeah . They found him in an alley , face down on the pavement . They worked on him , but he couldn 't be revived . What happened ? Preliminary diagnosis is apnoea : Respiratory failure . - As a result of what ? - The paramedics can 't explain . But if Harold stopped taking his medication , that could 've been a factor in his death . - At least in the visions he was seeing . - Harold wasn 't dying . He was killed as a result of what that woman took away from him . That your medical opinion ? - I saw something , Mulder . - What ? The fourth victim . I saw her in the bathroom before you came to tell me . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - Because I didn 't want to believe it . Because I don 't want to believe it . Is that why you 're here ? To prove it wasn 't true ? No . I came down here because you asked me to . - Why can 't you be honest with me ? - What do you want me to say ? That you 're right ? That I believe it , even if I don 't ? Is that what you want ? Is that what you think I wanna hear ? No . You can believe what you wanna believe , but you can 't hide the truth from me . If you do , then you 're working against me . And yourself . I know what you 're afraid of . I 'm afraid of the same thing . The doctor said I was fine . I hope that 's the truth . I 'm going home .

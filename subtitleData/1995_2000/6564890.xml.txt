 Keep going . Keep going . That 's the way . Don 't stop now . Come on , keep pushing . No pain , no gain . I want five more steps and then you 're done . Five . Four . Three . Good . And- - Hit it . Nice and easy . You 're really coming along , bobby . I 'm pleased with your improvement . You back off . Keep your fingers on your pepper spray , just like I told you . Mr. Piero , is all this really necessary ? Yes , ma 'am . I 'd say it is . So , what 's this guy 's story ? Cop killer , regular people killer . General all-Around waste of skin . So , what are you scared of ? The guy 's a freakin ' vegetable . What 's he gonna do , run over you with his big plastic wheel ? I 'll tell you what . You want to last here more than a week , you don 't ever underestimate this man . Never trust him , never let your guard down around him . Never . Capisce ? Comprendo . What 's up , Modell ? Hey , chuck ? What the hell happened , chuck ? Where 's Modell ? He had to go . the orderly 's being questioned , but judging by his mental state ... He 's not going to be much help to us . So there 's very little we know for sure at this point . What we do know is the last confirmed bed check was 2 : 04 a.m. As of 6 : 14 a.m. , the subject was reported escaped . Since then there have been no further sightings or contact . How did this man make his way out of the building ? Every indication is he simply walked out the front door . Due to the unique nature of this investigation , The F.B.I. will head the manhunt . The marshal service will lend their much-Welcomed expertise ... And will coordinate their efforts with myself ... Or my two designated S.A.C.S , agents Mulder and Scully . They apprehended the subject the first time around . Agent Mulder ? The subject 's name is Robert Patrick Modell . He 's a serial killer responsible for at least 17 murders . Specifically he targets law enforcement . In 1996 , he caused the death of an F.B.I. Agent ... And a Loudoun County sheriff 's deputy . It was all a game to him . He was looking for , in his words , " A worthy adversary . " To win makes him feel important . He likes to think of himself as a " ronin " - - A warrior without a master , Adhering to thebudo , the Japanese way of war . In truth , he 's a highly intelligent sociopath who has no fear of dying . In keeping with his game archetype , he likes to leave clues . This is why we expect to be contacted by him hopefully sooner rather than later . We fully expect him to pick up exactly where he left off . What did you mean when you said he just walked out the building ? Modell refers to himself as " pusher . " Technically speaking , all of his victims ' wounds were self-Inflicted . This man has a unique ability to force his will upon others- - To push his victims into hurting or killing themselves . - Say what ? - Look , this is all you need to know . Do not trust this man . Do not talk to him . Do not engage him in conversation , even if he is unarmed . Approach him only with extraordinary caution , and then only with adequate backup . So , what 's adequate backup ? Adequate backup ? Every cop you can lay your hands on . Line up for your assignment . What 's Model 's condition ? Extremely weakened . Doctors here say that he can barely walk . Oh yeah ? Yeah , Mulder , I 'm amazed he 's even alive- - The condition we last saw him in- - Comatose with a bullet in the head . How did he recover ? Apparently , one day about six months ago ... He simply woke up- - Unusual but not unheard of . What about his brain tumor that was supposed to be killing him ? It still is . Anybody on staff here we can talk to ? There 's a physical therapist . Mulder . What if Modell plans to pick up where he left off ? Where does that leave you ? You were his prime target . Should you even be heading this investigation ? As opposed to what ? What 's your point ? That it 's exactly what he wants- - That once again you 're playing his game . The escaped inmate , Robert Patrick Modell , Was convicted in 1996 , charges stemming from an incident ... In which he brandished a firearm in a downtown hospital . Two people died . Officials are cautioning area residents not to approach this man . He is considered to be extremely dangerous . Paul ? Can I help you ? Hi . - You 're not scared of snakes ? - Huh ? Looks like a timber rattler . Hold on tight to the neck now . Don 't let it bite you . Don 't drop it . You drop it , It 'll get you . Todd ? You think I could get some service now ? Go into the back ... And put the snake down . Certainly , Paul . This was the scene ... Here at Lorton penitentiary less than one hour ago . Agents of the federal bureau of investigation , Along with the U.S. Marshal service ... And representatives of local law enforcement , Met to assemble a multi - Agency task force . He couldn 't have been faking it completely . That 's all I can say . The gunshot wound did a hell of a lot of damage . You 're the officer that shot him . It says here that Modell had a visitor yesterday afternoon . Who ? It 's marked l.S.C. Little sisters of charity . They try to visit all the hospitalized inmates . Did Modell ever get any other visitors besides the little sisters of charity ? Not that I know of . He didn 't have much in the way of family . He was raised in foster homes mostly . Sounds like you got to know him pretty well . He never gave me any grief . He worked hard at getting better . I talked to him sometimes . About what ? Small talk . Nothing important . He 'd ask how I was . He 's a very considerate man . I don 't doubt for a second Robert Modell belongs in prison , But I never had any problem with him personally . agents . It 's Modell . He 's asking for you . We 're running a trace now . We just need 30 seconds . Yeah. two words . It 's alive . I don 't feel like playing your game right now , Modell . Touchy . Look , Mulder , there 's something I need you to hear . Tell it to me in person , Modell . No , seriously . Listen to me . No , you listen to me . Either you come back here on your own , Or I drag your sorry ass back on the bumper of my car . Time ? Four seconds . When did you turn into Clint Eastwood ? Don 't let him rope you in . Stop talkin ' like a tough guy and pay attention . I know you 're tracing this call . I don 't care . Mulder , hang up the phone . I have something I need you to hear . Mulder , are you going to listen- - We got it . There 's nothing back there . How far could he get ? Outside ! Where is he ? Where 's Modell ? He had to go . I 'm gonna take a wild stab here and guess ... This is a clue . Appears as if he died from ingesting paint . I imagine he did all of this and then drank what was left . See what you can make of it . Modell ? Cerulean blue . What 's the point of all this ? Maybe his choice of victim . This is Nathan Bowman , with the Loudoun county attorney 's office . He 's the prosecutor who tried Modell in 1996 . - You think it 's simple revenge ? - Sir , it 's not a manifesto . It 's the same single ideogram over and over . - Which is what ? - The hand it 's in is pretty sloppy , But I think it 's supposed to be kitsunegari--Foxhunt . Fox Mulder . That 's a little on the nose , don 't you think ? Was Nathan Bowman married ? Yep . What are you thinking ? Linda . Bet that 's his wife , huh ? Novamax realty . Hi . Linda ? I 'm sorry . Mrs. Bowman has left the office to meet a client . May I take a message ? Do you know the name of the client Mrs. Bowman went to see ? It 's , uh ... Mr. Fox Mulder . - It 's him . - Location . Find out where he 's at . Do you know where Mrs. Bowman went to meet Fox Mulder ? Location ? I know it 's a commercial property in falls church . - Um , can you hold on please ? - Yeah . Give me the falls church P.D. Unit six at 214 channel avenue . Signs of forced entry . We 're gonna check it out . exercise extreme caution . Backup is en route . hello ! Officer ? I 'm over here . Come on . That 's right . No , wait . Not that way either . But you 're gettin ' warmer . Dead ahead . Straight in front . Buddy , I 'm straight in front of you . What do you want me to do ? Draw you a map ? Keep comin ' . Almost there . put it down ! Put the gun down . Put it down ... now ! On the floor ! Face down ! Do it ! I got him . Get up here . Federal agents ! Officer , where are you ? Upstairs ! Sir , I got him . Here he is . I got him ! He 's gone crazy . Get him the hell away from me ! Gimme your gun . He was here . He did come for the woman . Why Bowman 's wife ? What would he want with her ? hey , we got a visitor ! Linda Bowman ? Fox Mulder . Hi . Uh , you 're my 12 : 15 ? The appointment was made ... This morning through my secretary . Uh , all I know is I was supposed to meet ... A Mr. Mulder here . He didn 't leave a number . And I couldn 't call him to tell him I was running late . Why would someone do this to Nathan ? Mrs. Bowman , Did your husband ever discuss his work as a prosecutor with you ? Sometimes . Did he ever mention the name Robert Patrick Modell ? Pusher ? That was Nathan 's biggest case . Why ? Can you think of any reason why this man Modell would take an interest in you ? What do you mean ? We believe he murdered your husband . It also appears he 's the man that made the appointment to see you today . No . No , no . He 's in prison . Not since 6 : 00 this morning . Oh , god ! You 're safe with us , Mrs. Bowman . If you 'll come with me , we 'll place you in protective custody . Find him . Yes , sir . Mulder ? Why didn 't Modell just kill those two cops ? - What was to stop him ? - Hopefully he was incapable . - As in " too tired " ? - We 've seen that before with him . Maybe . I don 't know . Something 's just not making sense . can I borrow your radio ? Yes , sir . Gracias , amigo . What took you so long ? Scully , I got him . Come quick . Where are you ? - Hold on . Hold on . - North side of channel , second floor . Some kind of company . Some engineering company . We need to talk . Shut up , Modell ! Listen to me . There 's something I need- - I said shut up ! Shut up or I will shoot you , you son of a bitch ! Mulder- - I will shoot you . Shut up ! You 're going to listen to me . You 're going to listen to me , Mulder . I will shoot you . Listen . Mulder . Mulder , what happened ? Where 's Modell ? He had to go . About ten minutes ago . He can 't have gotten far . Anything ? No sign . Yes , agent Mulder 's fine . Yes , sir . How you feeling ? Aside from the utter grinding humiliation ... That comes from knowing I let our suspect go , pretty good . It could 've happened to anyone , Mulder . No , actually it couldn 't have . I didn 't find Modell . He sought me out . He wanted me to hear his message . - Which was what ? - Don 't play the game . - Whose game ? His ? - I don 't think so . I 'm not even sure he 's playing a game . Of course he is . You said yourself that he was gonna pick up where he left off . Then why didn 't he kill the cops or the prison guard ? While we 're at it , why didn 't he kill me ? Why didn 't he make me eat a bullet out of my own gun ? - He could have . - He killed Nathan Bowman . He was definitely there , but that doesn 't prove that he did it . This man 's affected you . He 's influenced your thinking . It 's not like that . A man is made to drink a gallon of cerulean blue paint ? Kitsunegari ? Foxhunt ? You 're saying now that 's not Modell ? Modell is involved . He 's related to it somehow , But not the way you think . - That 's your opinion ? - Yeah . That 's my opinion . How can you be sure it 's your own ? What do we still agree on here ? That Modell was pursuing Linda Bowman ? I 'd like to know why . I 'm sorry . I don 't know if I can tell you much more ... than I already have . We appreciate your help . I-I know Nathan was very proud ... Of having prosecuted the case . He said this man Modell was extremely clever ... And dangerous , and that he was a menace to society . Nathan mentioned that an F.B.I. Agent ... Had ultimately shot him . Was that you ? Yes . He said you crippled him and put him in a wheelchair . Nathan said it was too bad ... That you just didn 't kill him . That it would 've saved the taxpayers the cost of a trial . Your husband talked with you a lot about it . Well , as I said , he was proud . I guess he felt that- - That it was his brush with greatness . Is it possible that he could 've mentioned you to Robert Modell ? No , no , I sincerely doubt it . You see , Nathan and I , we were only married two months . - How long did you know him ? - Well , it was two months and two days . Why wait when it 's true love ? You never know how long you have . No , you don 't . it 's not like Nathan was impulsive or flighty . I don 't want to paint him as that . He was true blue . Thank you . She killed Nathan Bowman . What ? Modell was there , but for some other reason . She killed her husband . - Agent Mulder- - - Just hear me out . Her husband 's brush with greatness . She doesn 't want to paint him as compulsive . Who the hell talks like that ? You tell me . She was waving it under our noses , playing with us . Modell told me . He warned me not to play the game . I think it was her game he was talking about . - Modell told you ? - Has she asked how ... Her husband was murdered , shown any interest in the details ? An escaped serial killer is supposedly stalking her . Does she seem particularly fearful to you ? The woman 's in shock , agent Mulder . She 's not herself . And , I might add , neither are you . You heard her in there , Scully . Mulder , no . I 'm sorry . You said it yourself . You said don 't listen to Modell , don 't trust him . But you 've done both . But what if she can do what Modell does ? - I think you should go home . - You think I should go home ? You 're suspended until such time I 'm confident your judgment is sound . - Give me your weapon . - Who you afraid I 'm gonna point it at ? Mulder , I think you should do what he says . Excuse me . Would it be possible for me to get something to drink ? Water ? Yes , ma 'am . I 'll have somebody come right in . I 'll prove it . Agent Mulder ? Go fetch her some water . I really don 't know the man that well . I 'm sorry you got the impression that I do . No , just anything at all that you might recall . Did he ever talk about his past ? Mention anybody special ? A woman ? Something like that ? No . Anything remarkable he ever said that you can remember ? I guess one time someone else said something about him that struck me as unusual . What was that ? It was one of the nuns who visits ... From little sisters of charity . She once referred to him as a conquered warrior . I thought that was kinda weird . Was this the same nun that visited him the day before he escaped ? The same one that always visits . How many times has she visited ? Maybe three , four . Would you take a look at something for me ? Is that the woman ? Is that the nun ? Hang on . I 'm blind as a bat . therapy room . Here . Glasses . Uh-Huh . Yeah , absolutely . It 's empty . Where 'd you leave ' em ? Uh-Huh . Uh-Huh . Okay . Oh , yeah , he 's here . No ! I need help in here ! Help ! You got him ? - Go home . - What ? Go home . Scully . Hey , Scully , it 's me . where are you ? I 'm at the prison . - You were told to lay off . - It 's a little late for that now . Modell 's therapist just electrocuted herself right in front of me . And she was on the phone when she did it . - It was Modell . - It was Linda Bowman . Mulder ! The therapist would have identified her . And verified that she visited Modell in the prison . Would have ? You don 't know that . Just trace the call and cut off any access that woman has to a phone . I 'm heading back now . Mulder , I 'm not at the safe house . You 're not ? We 're at the Chaimbridge mall investigating a suicide . Why isn 't anybody picking up at the safe house switchboard ? Back in the trucks . All right , let 's go . On the floor , Modell ! Hey , it 's Mel Cooley . On your face ! Do it ! Now ! I said now ! I have a gun . be careful . How 's his vitals ? - Did he try to speak to you ? - He said we got our man . What happened ? You were told to go home , agent Mulder . What happened ? He had a gun . I saw it clearly . It was a revolver . - He pointed a gun at you ? - We haven 't found the gun yet . He said to you that he had a gun . Yes ... and he did . Excuse me . Modell was unarmed . He purposefully drew skinner 's fire . For what possible reason ? To protect someone . Linda Bowman . To take the fall for her . That 's one hell of a plan , Mulder . The serial killer makes us believe that he 's guilty , In turn diverting the suspicion away from the real estate lady ? Well , he had me goin ' . Where is she ? They 've taken her home . There was no reason to keep her in protective custody , Mulder . It is over . No , it 's not . Where are you going ? If Modell makes it through surgery , I wanna be the first person he talks to . Mulder , talking to him has already done you enough harm . Do me a favor , Scully . Give me a call ... When you think I 've come to my senses , all right ? Sir , I 'm going to need to change the patient 's bandages . Call me if he wakes up , please . Yes , sir . Bobby ? Why did you do it ? I didn 't ask you to come after me . Don 't- - Don 't make a mistake . I 'm not . After what they 've done , Do you think I 'd let them get away with this ? I 'm gonna finish what you started . No . Stop now . Stop n- - Bobby . Bobby , you 're not in any pain . You feel wonderful . You 've never felt better . Your heart is slowing . It 's tired . It 's too worn out to keep beating . Let it rest . It slows . It slows . It stops . Hello . Yes , I have that information for you . I 've got the lidocaine , doctor . Never mind . Put him down as 7 : 38 . - Yes , doctor . - Sorry . Mulder . Scully , what are you doing here ? You were right about her , Mulder . Scully . She 's making me do this . Where is she ? She 's here . Mulder , make her stop . I can 't help myself . - Linda Bowman ! - Mulder , make her stop . - Show yourself ! - Mulder ! - No ! N- - I 'm gonna kill you . Don 't listen to her , Mulder . What ? It 's me . You were right about her . Linda Bowman is pushing you . - What the hell are you talking about ? - I 'm Scully . Linda 's right behind you . She 's telling you I 'm her . - You killed her ! - Mulder , I 'm Scully . I 'm not dead . She wants you to shoot me . She knows you 'll never forgive yourself . - Shut up ! Shut up ! - Listen to me ! Your mother is Tina . Your sister is Samantha . Shut up ! Modell warned you . Don 't play her game . Mulder . You think you can hold me ? Yes , I 'd like an ambulance at 214 channel avenue . Linda Bowman . She has an advanced temporal lobe tumor , just like Modell 's . It seems to run in the family . - She and Modell are related ? - Fraternal twins . he meant to protect his sister . Apparently , she only found out about his existence six months ago . They were separated when they were two weeks old . Raised apart . Her foxhunt- - I 'm guessing she wanted revenge for what she feels we did to her brother . Anything you want to add to that ? I think that covers it . Mulder , a moment , please ? I just wanted to say you did a good job . How 's that ? Nobody could 've figured this out but you . You knew it was Linda Bowman and not Modell . You were way ahead of me . I almost killed my partner . Mulder , despite that , you prevailed . You won her game . How come I feel like I lost ? I made this !

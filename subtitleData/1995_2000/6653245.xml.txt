 Where there is light there are shadows . Where there are shadows there is light . In that place ... human beings are born to pursue their dreams . If there is no light in the universe , and it 's controlled by the dark , there will be no lives . Only in the darkness ... will there be no hopes and dreams . This is an ironclad rule . If we don 't realize this , there is no future . Every passenger , long time no see ! Next stop is Earth . Layover will be 24 hours . Are you sure your destination is Earth ? But , why ? Everything is destined . Time , unstoppable , is ever-elapsing . This is the destiny of Tetsuro and I. Damn ... Damn ... HOSHINO , TETSURO Are you Tetsuro ? As long as you don 't resist , you can be forgiven . But how did you attempt to run away ? Duke ... Electronic disassembly . Death penalty . I 'll disassemble you ... ! You must be joking ! I won 't die ! This is for possessing an artifact of nature ! Get out of the way ! The 999 ! Damn ... Get off of me ! Hey , he was taken away by the Galaxy Express 999 ! You are ... You ... Wait ... Wait just a minute ! I 'll take revenge ... on 999 and Maetel . So you have to help me report to the supervisor . Please ! You think you can kill me ? Maetel ... I 'm not crying ; I 'm sweating . Tetsuro , you haven 't changed . Now I can stop worrying . It 's been only one year . There shouldn 't be any change . Am I dreaming ? Now ... She 's really Maetel ! Of course ! Mr. Captain ! Long time no see , Tetsuro . Guess who was hiding over by the window . Mii is one of my best friends . But he boarded the train without permission . If you throw him out , I 'll jump out with him ! This is the rule , this is the rule ... To resolve problems is also one of your obligations . Yes ... Tetsuro , you need a bath ... And you 're long-overdue for a haircut ! So let 's get to it . Just like the Tetsuro of old ... Tetsuro ... Here . That 's not my baggage , is it ? ! I thought it was confiscated ! I 'd given it up for lost ! That belongs to Tetsuro ; No one can confiscate it . So is this ... In my room ? It 's always there ? This is ... Maetel . The poison of the universe , and the Warrior 's gun . They are kept by Emeraldas . For me ... She was beautiful . She brought me water and food . And the flowers ... For me , she became ... I told myself one day I 'd get her out of the ice . But I ran away . Tetsuro , you didn 't run away . You had a great fight for saving them all . When I first went back to the Earth , I felt the mechanization of Earth would dwindle ... and fade . But then , almost right away , a new ruler came ... He had big plans , but no one knew his real agenda . He gave everyone plenty of food , so most loss their will to fight back . Although no one went hungry , The high-ranking people were seen as powerless hogs . I see ... Anyone who dared to resist would be banished underground . It was one or the other . The pest on the Earth , Porcodo III , Hoarfa . He 's responsible for the darkness in control of the colony . For the darkness ... ? Yes ... In the name of darkness , he suppressed the light in the universe . Flowers do not blossom , and birds no longer fly . The darkness covers the whole world . The whole universe ... The power is out . It 's a tunnel . We have to pass through this tunnel when we pass the asteroid belt . Now I remember ! I met Claire the last time this happened . Thank you for remembering me . Tetsuro , you look great . Ms. Claire ! I 'm glad to be able to travel with you again . You 're restored to your old self ? Someone pieced me together . Who has such power ? Do you know , Maetel ? When you meet him ... Where is that person ? That is our destination . If you don 't meet him , your journey will be endless . Well , the lights are coming on again ... After the C62-48 upgrade , some things changed . It doesn 't look all that different ... Welcome , Tetsuro ! Sorry for making you wait . You ... I 've never seen you here before . I am the personification of 999 . 999 and I are one and the same . You 're the train ? Yes ... I just recovered ... Protecting passengers is my job . Tetsuro . My name ... All travelers are documented , so we 'll always remember you . 999 never forgets its clientele . That 's it . Yes . One more thing ... Yes ... The Administration sent this for you . EARTH - ---- ANDROMEDA [ 999 ] BY WAY OF ( ORION / PLEIADES ) UNLIMITED NAME : TETSURO HOSHINO This was the ticket ... I used to ride to Andromeda ! I 'll hold onto that for you , okay ? NAME : MII-KUN Mii got one , too ! She applied to the Administration . Yep . EARTH - ---- ANDROMEDA [ 999 ] BY WAY OF ( ORION / PLEIADES ) UNLIMITED NAME : MII-KUN You 're a full-fledged passenger . I 'm sorry . Why 's it so cold ? There 's fog on the window . Because we 're approaching Pluto . Pluto ... I remember . It 's so cold . What 's wrong , Tetsuro ? Do you think they 're cold in there ? It occurs to me ... 999 runs at a constant speed in the direction of 11 . If this goes on , the order from Mino Empire is for full-scale war to begin . Proceed as planned . Understood . What 's going on ? There 's something wrong with the Administration 's order . Our communication line is down . I might lose control . What can we do ? I don 't know . There seems to be quite a force . ... Upon Galaxy Express ? Are you sure ? That 's it ... We were scheduled to stop at Planet Dinoka , but we need to stop the train and check what 's wrong . Sure . That seldom happens . Then where should we stop ? Um , our next station : Bright-Ring Firefly . What a strange name ! Firefly station isn 't often visited . It should remind Tetsuro of another planet . It 's very similar ... Similar to the planet Mother and I used to live on . It was long ago , but it seems like only yesterday . It 's a hot spring . A hot spring ! I saw it in the books and films of the 20th century . It 's an ancient hot spring ! And there are lots of fireflies ! And the food floats right up to you ! It 's so great ! You ... What 's wrong ? Nothing . My name is Iselle . I 'm the general manager of this resort . I am Maetel . Nice to meet you . I 'm Tetsuro . I know your names already . Your reputation precedes you . Please , if there 's anything you need , don 't hesitate to ask . Where are the other employees ? There are only two : My father and I. Only two ? Visitors have become rare . Please enjoy it . She knows us already . It 's kinda strange . Forget it ... Enjoy the spring and the food . The fiireflies and the food . This seems like a " Last Supper . " You don 't like that ? I like to take a SPA in a bustling place . I can 't wait until I 'm older . Such is the song of youth . I have many dreams . The dream of recovering the Earth ... There 's enough time in the future . My dream will come true as long as I work hard . I can realize it . Time doesn 't betray dreams . Thank you very much . The guest is very happy . Really ? Father ... And why are they wanted ? Criminals Maetel and Tetsuro are highly sought by the agency . Anyone who sees them should inform the agency right away . Let me repeat it again : Criminals Maetel and Tetsuro are highly sought by the agency ... Father ... How can I do that ? I know very well what you are doing . This is my insistence . It 's the insistence of a human . But Iselle ... Maybe you might ... I 'm okay . Tetsuro ... Don 't tire yourself because of the beauty . But fireflies are so beautiful . My father says they are the souls to be born . The souls to be born ... That 's a legend of this planet . There 's no planet more beautiful than this . Such a romantic legend ... You 've bee to many planets , haven 't you ? Yes , but it 's impossible to visit all of the planets in the universe . I envy you ... But when you saw me , why were you so surprised ? That ... The girl who used to take care of me looks just like you . So ... is she your girlfriend ? No ... She 's ... I 'm sorry . Mii-kun . What 's wrong ? There 's someone out there . But we 're the only people on this planet . Wait here ! Tetsuro ! What 's wrong with you ? " Fire before being fired upon . " This is the rule of survivors . I don 't shoot people in the back . It 's you ... You travel with Maetel . Kid . Why did Maetel take you here ? I 'm no kid ! What 's so funny ? ! Is that all you can do ? You think you 're good ? Way too slow . Go back home to mommy . Who are you ? Anyone coming to this planet is our guest . Protecting guests is our job . No ... go ! I could 've killed you . Why didn 't you shoot me in my back ? For sparing my life ... I 'll let you go this time . This won 't happen twice . You met the woman knight Helmazaria . You know her ? Helmazaria is a terrible knight , but she 'll soon regret underestimating you . She called me a kid . Tetsuro , are you ready to go ? But it hasn 't been 24 hours yet . We shouldn 't trouble Iselle any longer . Oh . Tetsuro , the train is ready to go . Tetsuro ! Iselle ! I made a lunch box for you . Thank you . Take care . Let 's carry on the legend we talked about last night . Someday the fireflies will metamorphose into humans . When the young man who transcends brightness appears , That young man will ... What ? Someday you 'll overtake time and light . Don 't forget ... Iselle ... Goodbye ... Take care of yourself . And , our future depends on you ! Future ... She makes it sound like she has no future ... Goodbye , our final guests . Goodbye . Goodbye , Tetsuro of my age ... The father and daughter didn 't inform me . They are against us . We should destroy it . I feel there 's love between him and the one who stopped me . Send a rocket to destroy it . Abnormal gravity wave ... Abnormal gravity wave ... Fire the rocket . Danger ... Danger ... Acknowledged . 999 , full speed ahead . Ouch . Mr. Captain ... Tetsuro , what are you doing here ? What 's wrong ? There 's an abnormal gravity wave coming , so we 're accelerating . Gravity wave ? Yes . It 's coming from Bright-Ring Firefly . What ? ISELLE ! Next comes the barrage of debris . We need to speed up ! It will be like flak from a grenade . Faster ! Yes . No ... The scraps are still much faster ! We 're not going fast enough . A scrap 30km in diameter is coming . What ? How is it possible ? Despair ... Destruction ... Despair ... Destruction ... With our current equipment , we can 't make it . This is ... That 's ... Captain Harlock ! And that ... Helmazaria . Helmazaria ? It 's getting worse . Alarm ... What ? There 's something invading . Warning ... Warning ... Many Herlimon 3 invaders are coming . Herlimon 3 ? I 'm not sure about the quantity . Suddenly , the invaders ... They are coming . Living in the dark ... He 's a metal robot . At this critical moment ... there 's the utmost sense of existence . Tetsuro ! That Herlimon is brave . Everyone knows . I don 't know where the weak spot is ! Damn ! What can we do ? They are going to explode ! Get ready ! Tetsuro ! Tetsuro ... Are you alright ? I think I 'm okay . They blow themselves up ? ! They have no choice . They are ordered to do so . That 's no way to duel ... Even if they don 't agree ... Tetsuro , that 's the enemy . Scary stuff . Are you talking about me ? Who ? Maetel ... I don 't want to see you this way . Helmazaria ! Maetel . I want to kill you and the young man who boarded the 999 . This is your way ? To slay at will ? ! To do as the ruler of the dark ? Right . Helmazaria ! Did you destroy Iselle and Bright-Ring Firefly ? ! Tetsuro ! Why ? Why did you have to destroy it ? Because we hate your existence . What ? To hell with you ! Where ... ? Maetel , LOOK OUT ! Don 't move ! I 'll kill you if you do . If it 's your intention ... Why don 't you do it ? Is it possible ... that young man got me ... ? Young men will displace us . You should have killed him back on the planet . Maybe so . I have a kid of his age . Helmazaria ... Maetel ... Whatever ... Please tell my son I was defeated by a strong warrior with a will of iron ... But tell Tetsuro I ran away . He will understand ; I feel so ashamed . Helmazaria ... Don 't come any closer . My heart ... We 'll say proudly we escaped the knight of the empire . It hurts ! This will do . Did Helmazaria really escape ? I didn 't think she ran away ... Someday we 'll meet again as warriors . Mr. Captain ... What 's wrong ? You don 't look good . Uh ... The Admin just gave us a warning : The Sun is going to explode . How could that happen ? When did that happen ? How did you get the message ? Not long ago ... from the Science Department . You 're lying ! How could the Sun explode ? ! The Sun is so big ... and ... It 's true . The whole Solar System will be influenced ... And it will all disappear Everything will be gone . Liar ... Liar ! The Earth is my only reason for getting on 999 ! That 's what I was fighting for ! Why am I even here ? ! Everything is going to perish ! The Solar System is dissolving ! THIS ISN 'T TRUE ! All our hopes and dreams are gone ... But they aren 't . Tetsuro ... Captain Harlock ...

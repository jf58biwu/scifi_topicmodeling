 Dr. Solomon , have you bought Strudwick 's new book yet ? I was gonna order it off the Internet until I realized there 's no such thing as amazon.Crap. Look at him , standing up there like all of this was for him . All this is for him . Fine . But he doesn 't have to bask . Look at him basking . That basker ! You 're just jealous because he got a book published and you didn 't . Jealous ? Ha ha ! Of his little comic book ? That 's a hoot and a half . Well , those 4 Nobel laureates over there kissing his butt seem to disagree . So , where are the Nobel guys ? Oh , they 're over there with Strudwick . But they 're not so great . One of them had to share his prize with a swede . Why don 't you go talk to them ? Oh , gosh , I 'm so nervous . Do I have any broccoli in my teeth ? Not a lot . Come on . Ok . Ha ha ha ha ! Hey , Dick . Quite an impressive turnout for me , wouldn 't you say ? Not bad . It 's no gay pride parade . Right . So , what 'd you think of the book ? As bathroom fare ? A triumph . Well , I 'm going to go get my picture taken for the national journal of physics . Don 't be in it . Oh , I won 't . I 've got to get in that picture ! Hey ! Are you whittling ? Actually , I found this piece of wood outside , and I figured I 'd make us all some twig men . Well , how nice of you ! Just had a lot of extra energy since Don and I called it off . Can 't understand why . So , call me later ? Ok . Ok . Bye . Well ... pretty good afternoon for me . A little , uh ... a little homework , a little music . A little making ' out . Oh , wait ! Did I say " a little " ? I meant a lot ! Tommy ! Aaah ! Ow ! It was incredible , man . We were just sitting there next to each other , and all of a sudden , we looked at each other , and somethin ' came over us . And then you kissed her ... didn 't you ? No , no , no . Not yet , right ? We--we , uh , we inched closer and closer together . Right ? And--and--and my lips were there , and ... ohh ! Her lips were there ... that sounds ... real nice , Tommy . And then you kissed her , didn 't you ? Well , no . Then I blacked out . But when I woke up , man , we were kissin ' ! And we just kissed and kissed- - aah ! Sorry . I think I need a new twig ! hello . Yes . This is Vincent Strudwick . You just published my book physics for a new millennium . I want all copies recalled . Why ? Well , besides the fact that I plagiarized the whole thing from renowned genius Dick Solomon , I also feel that the jacket photo fails to highlight my pouty , feminine mouth . Get on it ! Of course this is the real Strudwick ! Hello ? Hello ? What 's this ? It 's Strudwick 's new book . Oh , I thought I smelled a stink in here . Well , get used to the stink . It 's the new textbook you 'll be teaching from . What ? ! They say it 's brilliant ! Who says that ? ! Everyone . Well , call up " everyone " and tell them to go to hell . I 'll get right on that . Look at this . I could write a better book overnight . You think you 're the smartest man on the planet , don 't you ? For the thousandth time , yes ! Nina , cancel my classes . I 've got some writing to do . Get out of my way ! And that was Dr. Solomon . And this is my office . Oh , gentlemen , it has been a tremendous honor to be able to give you the tour . Thank you for coming . Oh ! You know what ? You haven 't seen our cafeteria ! I 'd love to join you , but I have a class . Do they have soup ? Yes , I believe they have soup . Is it a cream soup ? Uh , that I don 't know . I hope they have waffles . Oh , but not the round ones . Certainly not . No , no . Not the round ones , no . So , go . Go . It 's Ok . It 's Ok . Go . Have soup . Tommy , my man ! Lookin ' good ! Yeah . I 'm gonna go meet Alissa 's parents tonight . I 'm a little nervous . You know what I find , Tommy ? Parents ... love the Greeks . So what you want to do is come off as Greek . But not too Greek , see , ' cause that 's just creepy . I suggest medium Greek . That 's money . I 'm just gonna be myself . Ah . Bold choice . Relative intensities comparison ... spectrum gravitational field , deviation of the relative infinity of the construct- - hey , Dick ! The movie starts in 20 minutes . Don , I--I can 't come . I 'm in the middle of writing a groundbreaking book that 'll bring the physics world to its knees . Oh . What 's it called ? Payback 's a bitch , Strudwick . But , Dick , I ... I already got the tickets , like you told me . Here . Listen to this , Don . " To construct the analog curvature , " deplace a vector x a second time to the firstp . " The coinciding volume of the light complex is the same whether measured in terms of the variable k or L. " What do you think ? Watch out , Steven king . Oh , he better . Hey , Don . How 's it goin ' ? Oh , not good . Your brother just stuck me with a movie ticket . Oh , yeah ? What movie you seein ' ? I don 't remember the name of it , but it 's the one where Jackie Chan kills 2 guys with a baguette . I hear that one 's awesome ! Yeah . Ha ha . I would ask you , you know , but since we broke up ... oh . Of course . Sure . But I--I do have , you know , an extra ticket . Maybe we could go as , uh ... friends . Ok . Yeah . Friends . Hey , I 'll even buy the ticket off ya . No , don 't worry about that , unless you happen to have 6.50 handy . Oh ... I only got a 20 on me . I got change . [ Giggles ] Where you goin ' ? I have to put a fork at the other end of the table . I 'll miss you . Shut up . Woman : hi . Go in and check on the kids . Ok . There 's my parents . Don 't be nervous . They 're gonna love you . Ok . [ Clears throat ] Dad , this is Tommy . This is my father . Hello , Tommy . Nice to meet you . Yeah . Nice to meet you , too . You know , uh ... you 're nothing at all like I pictured . Hi . I 'm Alissa 's mom . Now I get it . Man ! You wrote a whole book ? Only the most brilliant book on physics ever written . The formulas in there are 400 years ahead of this planet 's most advanced modern thinking . Whoa , Dick ! You 're gonna be famous ! Why , yes , I am , thank you very much . Cold fusion , perpetual motion ? Humans are gonna be blown away by all that . This 'll wipe the smugliness off Strudwick 's furry , ratlike little face . Every expert in the country 's gonna be dyin to know how you figured all this out . You think ? Oh , and the fame ! I can 't wait to see Barbara Walters make you cry . Barbara Walters ? Yep . Grillin ' you about your childhood on national television . But I--I never had a childhood . Oh , you don 't have to tell me . A boy grows up awful fast on the mean streets of , uh ... where are you from again ? Outer space ! What was I thinking ? ! If I publish all the secrets of the universe , we might just as well walk into the pentagon and yell out , " we 're aliens ! " Oh , yeah . That would be quite a predicament . You idiot ! Well ... [ Sighs ] This is my place . Wow . Smells , um ... rustic . Thanks . You know , this was really great . Isn 't it cool that we can just go to a movie as friends ? It is cool . It 's great . Really great . So , you want a cup of coffee or anything ? Nah . I should probably go . Ok . That was a wonderful meal , dotty . Yeah , delicious . Well , I 'm glad you liked it . Here , mom , let me give you a hand . [ Clears throat ] So , uh ... I really like Alissa a lot . She 's a lovely girl . Yeah . You and me , we 're lucky guys , huh ? We got ourselves a couple of hotties , huh ? Excuse me ? Listen , man . Ahem . Between you and me , has Alissa mentioned anything about my kissing ? What ? The thing is , we 're makin ' out , like , a lot . Right ? But she 's a little more experienced than I am , which is why any feedback she gave you 'd be really appreciated . I--I think maybe we should change the subject . Oh , Ok . So . What does your father do ? Uh , he 's a professor . At Pendelton . Um , Dick Solomon ? Oh ... oh , boy . That was somethin ' , huh ? I wasn 't expecting ' that ! Oh , me , neither . Well , I guess we had one left in us . That was a big mistake . Oh , big . Oh , big . [ Chuckling ] Well , uh ... I , uh ... I 'd better be goin ' . Ok ! I 'll see you around . You know what ? We 'll do somethin ' , right ? Oh , that 'd be nice . God , I want you . Take me ! 108 for 210 ... 108 for 211 ... 109 for 212 ... Dr. Solomon , channel 58 just called and asked if you would like to appear on some show called men ideas ? Men ideas ? ! Yes , indeed , I do ! Mary , look at this . What ? I guess the word is finally getting out . I 'm gonna be a guest on men ideas . Actually , you 're just a panelist . What ? The show 's all about Strudwick . No ! Ohhh ... [ Sobbing ] You 're taking it better than I thought you would . [ Honking ] I 'll be right there ! [ Chuckles ] It 's the laureates . I 'm taking them to banana republic . Bernard has never worn jeans . But , Mary ... [ Honk honk ] Oh . I 'm coming ! Jeez ! Dick ! What 's going on ? ! What do you mean ? What is your son doing with my daughter ? What are you talking about ? Well , apparently , they 've been dating for 3 months . That 's impossible . Tommy 's been dating some girl named Alissa for 3 months . Alissa Strudwick , you idiot ! My daughter ! What ? ! That hot little blond number 's your daughter ? ! How dare you describe her in that way ? ! No Strudwick is gonna date my son ! Your son is an ill-mannered , obnoxious boor ! You take that back ! All right . He 's rude ! He 's smug ! He kissed my daughter right in front of me ! Wait a minute . Vincent . What ? This is really bothering you , isn 't it ? Damn right it is . I suggest that you teach your son some manners . What 's so damn funny ? Nothing . Nothing . Oh , no . No , no ! Oh , no ! No , no ! What is it , Dick ? It 's nothing . I can 't talk about it . Oh , no ! What ? ! It 's nothing you 'd be interested in . It 's just about the two of you , that 's all . It 's about us ? What is it ? It 's about what your father said about you . But , please , don 't ask . I promised him I wouldn 't say . What ? ! What ? ! All right , here it is . Now , listen . Your father thinks the two of you should break up . What ? Why ? Something about him not trusting you , you being too immature , you following in the footsteps of that aunt of yours that everybody hates . Aunt Ellie ? Mmm . Everybody loves aunt Ellie . Oh , well ... there must be somebody in your family that everybody hates . Cousin Jeff ? That 's the one . Cousin Jeff . I 'm nothing like cousin Jeff . His words , not mine . Why would he say that ? My dad can be such a jerk sometimes . Oh , don 't tell me . I think the two of you are fabulous together . I guess I 've always been able to see you for the intelligent , independent young woman that you are . Thank you ! Wait a minute . But if your father can 't see that , then I think you have no choice but just to go straight home and be furious with him . Oh , I 'm on my way ! Oh ! Dick ... are you sure- - I 've already said too much ! Well , this is much better , huh ? Absolutely . We should never have gone to your apartment . There 's , uh ... a bed in there . Yeah . What were we thinking ? I mean , this ... this makes more sense . This ... is the perfect place for 2 friends to share a cup of coffee . You know , I knew we could do it , Don . Totally casual . No problem . Hi , guys ! Harry ! What--What 's up ? How 're you doin ' ? Where- - what 's up ? Where you goin ' ? Well , I was just goin ' over to the park to push over some of those tai chi guys . Ohhh ... and what are you doin ' ? We 're just havin ' some coffee . Havin ' coffee . Want some coffee ? I 'd love some coffee ! Oh , great ! There 's Nothin ' better than 3 friends sittin ' around , havin ' some Joe ! I 'll get the cup , and you pour . Ok , great . So , Harry , what 'd you do today ? Oh , well , my day started sort of early . You know that thing where , um , if you say " rabbit , " you 'll have good luck all day ? I was gonna do that first thing in the mornin ' . And then there was lunch . Morning , Vincent . How 's it goin ' ? Did you talk to your boy last night ? Yes . We talked , we laughed , we shared . Then there were the , uh , hugs , as usual . How 'd it go with Alissa ? She came home , slammed the door in my face , and locked herself in her room . Ooh . Ouch . Did she , by any chance , say that , uh , she hates you ? How 'd you know that ? Call it fatherly intuition . She said ... she said ... oh , never mind . Go on , Vincent . You can tell me . She said why couldn 't I be more like ... like you ? Well , I can understand that . Some of us devote our time to our families , others opt instead to write books . I 'm sure you made the right choice . Not for your daughter , of course , but for you . This is awful ! No , don 't worry ! As the decades ... slip by , these wounds will scab over and harden into bitter scars . And you 'll get together then , Vince . I know you 'll have a good time then . Ohhh ... Ok , everybody , here we go . Johann , why don 't you sit right here ? Here you go . Ok . Sit down . Sit down . Bernard ... give me the gum . Give me the gum . Spit it out ! So , Don , do you think we 'll be Ok here ? Come on , Sally , there must be 50 people here . That 's true . We 're not gonna do it in front of 50 people . You sit over there . I 'll sit over here . And we 're on in 3 ... 2 ... hello , and welcome to men ideas . I 'm Hamilton bell . And to my right is Dr. Vincent Strudwick , author of physics for a new millennium and the brightest star of the Pendelton university faculty . Huh ! We are also honored to have a distinguished panel of Nobel laureates- - Dr. Bernard yamshuth ... Dr. Carl mainen ... Dr. Ronald schenk ... and Dr. Johann borgeson . And finally , " physics professor " and raconteur ... and master of close-up magic Dick Solomon . " [ Applause ] Tell me , Dr. Strudwick . Did you have any idea when you set out to write your book that it would get this kind of reception ? Honestly ? Yes . Well , it- - it is , a , uh , tremendous work , but it has come at quite a cost , hasn 't it , Vincent ? What ? I think you know what I mean . Well , I 'm sure we all have questions for you , Dr. Strudwick , so why don 't we begin- - yes , I have one . Ok , then . Dr Solomon . Yes . I was discussing the book last night with my son Tommy . Hi , Tommy . Love you . And , uh , it made me wonder . You seem to have a reasonable grasp of spectral analysis , and yet you have no idea where your teenage daughter was last night at midnight--my house , where kids are allowed to flourish . Why don 't you shut your mouth , Solomon ? ! Why don 't you make me ? Let 's go ! Come on ! Ok . Ok . I 'm cool . I 'm cool . Please , oh , please , gentlemen . Let 's be civil . Don 't look at me , ham . I 'm just trying to be a good father . I am a good father . Oh , yeah ? Then why did you insist that your daughter never see my son ever again ? ! What are you talking about ? I never said that . What ? I only said that he should mind his manners ! Liar ! I might 've been paraphrasing- - I 'll kill you ! Tommy ! Tommy ! It 's Ok ! Come on . Hey . Hey . Hey . I 'm all right . This is a show about a science book . It should be boring . You 're an idiot ! It 's on , bitch ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Please , everyone ! Let 's just stay calm ! Calm down ! Peace ! Peace ! Peace ! Well ! This guy thinks he 's all that , but he 's notall that ! Oh , yeah . This is where it gets good . Mary : I am sick of you [ Bleep ] ! My god . Look at that face I 'm making . Now look at this . Now , that 's a punch . Dick , that was the makeup woman . Well ... she had it coming . Hey ! Are you and Don back together again ? No . Why would you think that ? Well , he 's got his tongue in your ear . Harry ... Don and I have some issues to resolve , but we 're gonna get together tonight and talk ' em out . Uh-huh . Wear somethin ' nice . Shut up ! I just don 't understand it . All I did was assuage my professional jealousy by attacking Strudwick on a deeply personal level , using his daughter and my son as unwitting pawns . Yet somehow I come off looking like the bad guy . What are you talking about ? You jeopardized my relationship for your own petty goals . Tommy , sometimes you have to take one for the team . Oh , you think you 're all that ! I am all that ! Oh , you want some of this ? does your dad hate me ? No . He 's just overprotective . Does your dad hate me ? No . He loves you . He thinks you 're great . And so do I. Get your lips off that Strudwick . That 's--really , that 's just his way . That 's how he is . He really likes you . Honestly . Are you sure ? Yes ! Absolutely . He 's just--You know . He 's , uh ... Dick : he 's what ? ! He 's a big fat jackass ! At least I 'm not a Strudwick .

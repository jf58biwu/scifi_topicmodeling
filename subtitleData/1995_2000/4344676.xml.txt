 [ Broots ] Jarod sent these . From what I can tell , all taken within the last few weeks . There 's Portland , Houston , Lexington . - Someone 's been tracking us ? - Not us - You . Look . Feels like the hunter 's becoming the hunted . [ Ringing ] - What ? - Someone has eyes for you . The question is , who ? [ Jarod ] Sometimes the answer is the question . Don 't get Kwai Chang on me , Jarod . Ooh , I love that guy , wandering the earth , helping people . Like I 'm trying to help you and your father . My father ? Jarod . [ Dial Tone ] - What did he mean , help your father ? - Damn it . What is it , Parker ? My father is still in hiding ... but I received a cryptic e-mail from him this morning . Daddy told me not to trust anyone . There 's a Centre contract out on my father . Well , then why-why did he follow you ? They probably think I 'll eventually lead them to the real target . - [ Barking ] - [ Chattering ] Don 't anybody touch my cards , or it 'll get ugly ! Yeah , huh . - And Harry cheats . - Yeah , yeah . [ Barking Continues ] Damn raccoons . [ Footsteps Running ] [ Barking Continues ] [ Growling ] [ Mumbling ] I got something for your garbage-eatin ' little ass . - [ Barking , Whining ] - [ Screaming ] The fish is swimming along happily in its natural environment . You drop the hook in , you yank it out , you catch him . - And then after all that , you release him ? - It 's really not that confusing . - [ Siren Wailing ] - Tell that to the fish . Hey , boy . What 's going on ? Hunters caught something freaky up in the mountains . - [ Chattering ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Screaming Continues ] - [ Screams ] - [ Man ] Is that a boy or a girl ? - [ Gasps ] - Get away from the window . - [ Man ] Look . What kind of creature is that anyway ? - [ Grunting ] Come on now . Come on . - [ Woman ] I think it 's a girl . Don 't make it any harder than it has to be . [ Groaning ] [ Woman ] Oh , that poor thing . - Come on . Get in the car . - [ Whimpering ] I 'll take that . You ever see anything like that before ? [ Mumbling ] [ Screaming ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because ofwhat I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - [ Mumbling ] - [ Man ] Locate Dr. Bennett right away . Get a lab crew , linguist , pediatrician . - I vote for a veterinarian . - The state is sending one of their people to observe . - [ Man ] A social worker ? - Psychiatrist . - We don 't have much time . - [ Gasps ] - Oh ! Damn it ! - Oh , stop her ! Go ! Go ! Somebody stop her ! [ Groans , Hits Ground ] [ Man ] It 's like she 's never seen a window before . It 's okay . Everything is going to be okay . It 's okay . I 'm not gonna hurt you , honey . - I 'm just gonna clean this up . - [ Whimpers ] How you feeling ? Hmm ? All right . I 'm almost done . You 're making a big mistake dealing with her like this . She 's afraid to be touched . We 'll instruct our own staff , if you don 't mind , Doctor - Bell . Jarod Bell . The state shrink from Provo . Your office contacted us about your arrival . - This is Doctor Bennett . - How do you do ? - Hello . - I 'm Dr. Wolverton . I read your book , The Effects of Isolation and Deprivation on the Human Psyche . Your theories prompted a great deal of debate within the psychiatric community . My writings are controversial because they push the envelope of psychosocial medicine . Well , it 's always difficult to break from the pack . Given her physical appearance and her lack ofverbal skills ... she must have been isolated at a very young age . The question is , what made her suddenly decide to make contact . - Everything 's gonna be okay . - [ Whimpers ] We show her kindness , we establish some kind of trust ... and she 'll begin to communicate in her own way . We don 't have that kind of time . With no legal guardian ... we lose her to Social Services in 36 hours . You haven 't been able to find any family ? No , the police are running her picture on the net . Until then ... I suggest we take advantage of the time we have left with our one-of-a-kind specimen . Bring her out . - We were looking for you . - Good news , I hope . Well - [ Clears Throat ] The numbers on these photographs are Level One encryption codes ... used exclusively for Triumvirate communiques . - Mutumbo ? - The assassin uploaded them through our satellites to Africa . I was able to isolate the killer 's designation . He calls himself " The Owl . " And according to personnel files ... that designation is used by Mr. Cox . The Grim Reaper . You can 't say Jarod didn 't warn us . [ Laughs ] Broots , I wanna know everything about our picture-taking freak . Uh , Miss Parker , I ran Mr. Cox through the database . He came up empty . The guy is a blank slate . The only proof that we have that he exists is the fact that we 're looking at him . - Sweep his office . - He doesn 't have one . But get this . I-I talked to my friend Rory in Purchasing . The fellow with the artificial leg ? No , that 's Rudy in Public Information . - Rory 's the one with the birthmark on his head shaped - - [ Stomps ] like Gumby . Okay . Anyway , Rory told me that Mr. Cox has been mail ordering surgical supplies ... - and having them delivered at the Centre . - Track the deliveries . I 'm on it . What if Mr. Cox really is the Grim Reaper ? - All the more reason to make sure he doesn 't find my father . - Hmm . [ Banging ] - Make sure to keep her room warm . - Yes , ma 'am . Thank you . I hate to see her kept in this place . I 'm Dr. Sulvane-Anne . Dr.Jarod Bell . I 'm the state psych . She needs familiar surroundings . Plants , grass , sunshine . - Mm-hmm . - I 'm sorry . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . We have to keep her environment sterile . If she 's been isolated her entire life , we don 't know what her immune system can handle . Well , her vital signs are off the chart . B.P. is 200 over 120 , pulse is 150 . - At least let me give her a mild sedative . - No meds . And I want minimal interaction . We 're only here to observe . How do you expect to find out who she is if you don 't try to communicate with her ? She 's unable to communicate , Doctor . And the hard truth is , she 's not going to learn for a very long time . I agree with Dr. Wolverton . We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study the very core of the human animal . Specimen , animal . How about human being ? [ Banging Continues ] If you 'll excuse us ... we 've got to go meet with the press . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Sighs ] - Are you okay ? - [ Sighs ] [ Anne ] I just can 't get past her eyes - how sad they look , how lost . You know , it only takes one person to make a difference . Cardinal rule of traumatized patients , Dr. Bell : Do not invest emotionally . How come I don 't think you really believe that ? [ Banging Continues ] Where did you come from , little girl ? - [ Chattering ] - Doctor ! Doctor ! - Is the little girl able to speak ? - Does she understand anything ? - How long has she been in the wilderness ? - First of all ... we don 't have any answers as ofyet . But this is the finest private research facility in the state . And we 've assembled a team of specialists who are the best in their fields . - Was there any sign of abuse ? - How is she holding up emotionally ? [ Wolverton ] As Dr. Bennettsaid , we have an expert team working on the situation . Now , we 'll keep you updated as the situation warrants . - No more questions . Thank you . - [ Chattering ] No more questions . Thank you . [ Chattering Continues ] [ Man ] Give us the answer to a simple question , Doctor . She 's pretty . - Are you on Dr. Bennett 's team ? - Not exactly . - Dr. Jarod Bell . - Leslie Twain . I 'm with the Salt Lake Chronicle . If you could just let me get a couple of pictures , a brief interview for my paper ... I might be able to help you figure out who she is . My story would be syndicated all over the country and - Dr. Bell is not at liberty to give interviews . Rest assured , everything is under control . [ Glass Shatters ] I 'm sorry , you 're gonna have to go join the others right now . - What happened ? - Where the hell did she go ? Where ? - Did you check the main building ? - Top to bottom . She has to be somewhere on the grounds . - What about the press ? - We moved them in the commissary . - Wait a minute . What are you planning on doing with that ? - It 's for her own safety . That weapon was not meant to be used on humans . - The subject is in a total state of - - The subject ... is a little girl who is scared out ofher mind . Please , Doctor . Let us do our work . [ Chattering ] [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Wilson , call extension 11 . Dr. Wilson , extension 11 . What now ? We find her first . Come on . - Here we go . Take my coat . - Okay . - [ Gasps , Whimpers ] - It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm not going to hurt you . Here . Go ahead . Take her . Go ahead . - [ Grunts ] - [ Laughs ] You think that 's funny ? - I guess that is pretty funny . [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] - She seems to be reacting to the change in her environment . - Hmm . Hervitals are stable . She 's breathing easier . So what did you say to her up in that tree ? Nothing . We just laughed . What are those plants doing in there ? - That room was to be kept sterile . - They can 't harm her . [ Wolverton ] This is too much interaction . The subject is too important . The subject ? Why don 't we give her a name ? Assigning her a name is assigning her a personality . It could prejudice the results of the case study . Violet . Violet . I like it . - [ Babbles ] - She spoke . [ Babbling Continues ] - Wh-What is she saying ? - It 's mimicry . Random phonetics . No . She 's trying to tell us something . [ Babbling Continues ] - [ Anne ] What 's happening to her ? - She 's going into seizure . - Help me hold her down . - [ Groaning ] MyGod , she 's burning up . Dr. Bennett , I need my medical bag . Get my bag now ! [ Gasps ] [ Woman On P.A. ] Social Services , please call 571 . Social Services , please call 571 . Hey . You should go home and get some sleep . Later . The results of the tests came back . It was a common flu strain . It went right through her defenses . Well , she responded to the medication . It was scary to see herso helpless . - Are you investing emotionally , Doctor ? - [ Laughs ] I don 't understand it . Her room was sterile , the plants were indigenous ... and none of us exhibited symptoms ofbeing sick . - I don 't know where the virus came from . - [ Grunting ] Oh , she wants her doll . It 's the only thing that calms her . What are you doing ? This is a cocktail of cold and flu strains . There must be at least 10 separate viruses here . Or 12 . You think someone purposely infected this doll ? Unless you believe that a dozen infectious viruses ... magically infested the same square inch of material . Well , I don 't understand . Why ? Someone close to the situation is afraid that Violet is going to begin to communicate . What you 're implying is crazy . These men are the top in their fields . Wolverton 's research has saved thousands ... and Bennett 's work with P.O.W. ' s in isolation is groundbreaking . I know the record . I don 't know the men . We have to get that little girl out of here . I can 't be a part of this . I see the way you look at her . It 's not just a doctor-patient relationship . What are you so afraid of , Anne ? I had a son - Matthew . He was a little younger than Violet when he got sick . I took him to the best clinics in the country ... the best doctors . - But I couldn 't save him . - I 'm sorry . Losing him nearly killed me . I cannot go through those feelings again . Not again . [ Door Closes ] [ Bennett ] Dr. Bell . Dr. Bell ! - Dr. Bennett . - I understand that you 've located the source of the illness . Yes , as matter of fact , I did . I was going to show it to you in the morning . It seems that the infection came from her doll . This is very disturbing . - [ Clattering ] - What was that ? Dr. Bennett . She 's not in her room . - What ? - The little girl is gone . Damn it . Damn it ! Violet . Violet , where are you ? [ Laughing ] [ Laughing Continues ] - [ Grunting ] - It 's okay . It 's my car . It 's okay , honey . It 's okay . You okay ? Wait , wait . Stop , stop . I 'd like a second chance to help , if you 'll let me . This is the fourth time Cox has pulled over . What the hell is he looking for ? - I never pictured Cox as the pickup truck kind of guy . - [ Sighs ] [ Miss Parker ] Yeah , well , he 's a blank slate , remember ? Oh , which reminds me , I talked to Rory in Purchasing . He said he didn 't know where Cox had the surgical tools delivered . - We 're going in circles . - Wait a minute . - What 's he doing with the shovel ? - Oh , criminy . That 's a dead something . He 's taking pictures of roadkill , just like he did when he was tracking you . Flattering comparison . Thank you . Tell me he didn 't just scoop that worm banquet into the truck . Ew . What now ? Stay with him . If that psycho gets to my father , we 're all roadkill . What makes you so sure that this is where she came from ? The winters in the region are far too brutal ... for anyone to survive without some kind of heat source . - According to this map , there 's just one hot spring in the area . - [ Airplane Passing Overhead ] [ Babbles ] Come on . The water 's warm . Her home must be close . [ Laughs ] [ Jingling ] Hmm . Interesting . Where did she get the glass ? Or this ? What is it , Jarod ? I think it might be Violet with her parents . God . Could it bepossible ? [ Babbles ] [ Babbling Continues ] Where is she going now ? [ Anne ] Oh , my God . It 's a wrecked plane . Jarod , it 's her parents . Da . Ma . Da , Ma . - What is it ? - Looks like some kind of video cable . [ Clock Chiming ] - How 's she doing ? - Resting . [ Sighs ] Could someone have known about her being out there and done nothing ? Yes . From the looks of these photos , it 's been going on for over 10 years . This is personal to you , isn 't it ? Yes . It 's personal . You wanna talk about it ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . Try me . - Some other time , maybe . - Oh , where are you going ? To find out who did this . - Did someone die ? - Yes . Where have you been ? - You really were at a funeral . - In Dover . Mr. Cox , he spent the night there . He 's pretty chummy with the owner . - The old guy ? - I 'm running him down , but I don 't think ... he has any connection to the Centre . Weird thing though , Mr. Cox only came and went through the back door . With Hefty bags . Yeah , I don 't know what 's in them . What comes out the back door of a mortuary ? Body parts . Well , whatever was in them , he had sent to the east wing of SL6 . East wing . That was the infirmary when I was a kid . I got my tonsils taken out there . Well , I don 't think he 's handing out lollipops to little girls . - Not live ones , anyway . - Ew . I think it 's time we paid the Grim Reaper a visit . [ Clears Throat ] Give me the photos . - What are we doing here ? - I 'm gonna leave these for Cox . Let him know he 's being watched too . [ Clinks ] Did you lose something , Mr. Broots ? [ Electricity Humming , Crackling ] Love what you 've done with the place . [ Sniffs ] That 's right . You had your tonsils removed here , didn 't you ? Well , I had to clean out the old file cabinets . Out with the files , in with the body parts ? Hangin 'at the mortuary . Mysterious bags of God knows what . Scooping roadkill . - You followed me ? - You take surveillance photos of me ... you better be prepared for a little retaliation . Who 's the gray hair ? His name is Carl . He 's my father . - Your-Your father 's the mortician ? - Mmm . We used to have long talks about life ... while he was embalming the corpses . Now we just exchange tricks of the trade for my hobby . My father gave me an erector set once . - Hobby ? - Mmm . Taxidermy . Well , it 's a second chance at life as a part of my collection . The eyes have to be replaced with glass orbs . You know , in some cultures I 'm stealing its ability ... to see its way into the afterlife . Well , that 's Dad 's theory , anyway . Daddies can be so much fun . Speaking of which . - How is your father these days ? - Wouldn 't you love to know ? Oh , Miss Parker . Those pictures of you - I didn 't take them . [ Electricity Humming , Crackling ] But ... I will be keeping an eye on you . This is one from the earlier surveillance tapes . The footage was taken near the crash site . These shots were taken three years later . [ Anne ] I can 't believe she survived all those years alone . [ Jarod ] She was living on pure instinct . This where she got the wound on her ankle . [ Screams ] That 's some kind of animal trap . - [ Screaming ] - How long was she caught in that thing ? According to the logbook , three days . - Who could 've done something like this ? - Watch . [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] My God , it 's Dr. Wolverton . - I 'll be damned . - No . But he will be . - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - What do you mean , Cox is telling the truth ? [ Clears Throat ] I was digging around , and I found this - Lyle 's expense account . Three weeks ago , Lyle bought a very expensive Leica camera . Well , what kind of camera do you think took those shots ? And then there 's this . A Centre memo . Lyle not only brought Mr. Cox to the Centre , but he created his position . My brother is behind the hit . He 's trying to kill Daddy ? You have lost your mind . You took these photos . Cox is a Centre assassin , and he works for you . You 're suggesting that I would have my father - our father - killed ? Stop trying to make yourself a part of this family . If you looked - really looked - you would see that I 'm just trying to help him , the same way you are . Yeah , I got an e-mail from Dad too . Scared the hell out of me . He 's on the edge of something terrifying . He told me to take the photos and leak them to the Triumvirate ... to start establishing a pattern for your alibi . - Alibi for what ? - I don 't know . He suggested I start a paper trail for myself too . Something big is going down . So big , Mutumbo 's coming to town . - Mutumbo 's coming here ? - According to Dad , to meet with Cox . I shouldn 't be telling you this . He told me not to trust anyone . He told me the same thing . So what do we do now ? We wait , and we pray . [ Bell Tolling ] [ Shudders ] - [ Grumbles ] - Don 't be afraid . Here 's your doll . I 've been watching you for a long time . I was an observer . I never interfered . I never harmed you . God knows that , and so do you . [ Mutters ] Your fate was determined by the laws of nature ... not man , not me . Here . I 'm sorry I have to do this , but I can 't let anybody find out . [ Groaning ] So who 's the animal now , Doctor ? - [ Whistling ] - Huh ? Oh . Oh . What the - Where am I ? What 's going on ? [ Jarod ] Disorienting , isn 't it ? I magine how it must have felt for a four-year-old little girl . Give me my clothes . Ow ! [ Groans ] My shoes ! I 'd like to , but I wouldn 't wanna contaminate the integrity of my case study . Besides , Violet had nothing when you found her . It would 've been no different if I hadn 't found her . I was just an observer ! It was a scientific study . Oh , and it paid off for you , didn 't it ? Books , research grants , celebrity status . - Oh . - Only your data wasn 't based on scientific research . - It was based on the terror of an orphaned child ! - [ Groans ] How long did she starve alone in the wilderness for your study , Doctor ? - Help me ! - No can do . What with the cold , the sleep deprivation , the hunger - You 're gonna be quite a specimen when they drag you out of there . Oh , this is crazy . I could die down here ! Yes , quite possibly , you could . We 'll just leave that up to the laws of nature . Unless you care to confess . No ? Oh , well . Have fun . All right ! I left her out here ! I - I left her out here . [ Sobbing ] God forgive me . What have I done ? - [ Sobbing ] - Hey , Doc . Well , here 's something to keep you company if you get lonely . Oh . [ Sobbing Continues ] I don 't know how to thank you , Jarod . I 'm the one that should be thanking you . It took a lot of courage to sign those court papers to become Violet 's legal guardian . I guess you could say I got a message . - A message ? - Ah , you wouldn 't believe me if I told you . - Try me . - [ Laughs ] I had a dream last night . My son came to me , and he said it would be all right . He said he didn 't want me to be alone anymore . - Does that sound crazy ? - It sounds perfect . [ Laughing ] Is that for me ? Mmm . Thank you . And I have something for you too . [ Gasps , Sighs ] Jah-rod . Have a beautiful life , okay ? - Bye . - Bye . You got a new doll . - [ Door Closes ] - [ Engine Starts ] [ Vehicle Departs ]

 Previously on 3rd rock from the sun ... we four aliens dreamed for the first time . I 'll tell you what you want to know ! Of course you will , Dr. Solomon . Naturally , not being human , we thought our brains were decomposing . Ahhhh ! We planned an immediate return to the home planet . We 'll leave tonight at 8 : 53 . W-when are we coming back ? Could be a week , a year , could be 200 years . What about Mary ? Oh , she 'll be dead . Maybe I am losing my mind , but while there 's a little left , I want to marry you . This is so great ! I know ! Uh , Dick , are you sure ? Absolutely . Well , this is good-Bye , then . I had a dream you asked me to marry you . You had a what ? People dream . People dream ? ! Hello ! Sally ! Harry ! They 're gone . I miss them . And that togetherness is what is most celebrated about this very special occasion . Oh , Mary , this is the happiest day of my life . You look so beautiful . And I look smashing in my tuxedo . My bow tie matches my Cummerbund . You 're not wearing a Cummerbund . Yes , I am . You 're supposed to wear it on the outside . Oh . Oh , that explains the rash . Now , then , if anyone objects to this sacred union , speak now or forever hold your peace . I object . Oh I think that 's my arm . Huh ? Oh , sorry . My family ! You made it ! I was afraid I was never going to see you again . You look well . You got some colour . Could have used you at the wheel , Dick . Oh , but no . You had to stay and marry that earth chick . Yeah . With tragic results for us . I .. I tried to contact you . I tried everything . I even built a transmitter , but then I ... spilled grape soda on it and the whole thing shorted out . However , I did manage to have a brief conversation with the captain of a shrimp boat . So that 's supposed to make it better ? Oh , come on . You got to go back to the home planet . What 's so bad about that ? Oh , nothing . Except when you pass too close to a Quasar and this happens ! Oh , my god ! You 've turned into a woman ! Well , not everywhere . As if showering in gym class wasn 't traumatic enough . Thank you very much . Dick , I think it 's time to cut the cake ! I-I 'll be right there . Y-you 're not going to leave again , are you ? No . We have some ... unfinished business to take care of . I-I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . No , I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! Aah ! Aah ! Ooh ! Ooh ! Aah ! Ah ! No , I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! Stop ! Stop ! You 're ruining my tuxedo ! Stop ! Dick , I made breakfast ! Dick , are you all right ? Oh , no , Mary , I had another one of those horrible dreams ! What happened ? We were getting married . Thank you . No , no . No , that was the good part , but then my family showed up . Oh . Don 't tell me . They objected . Well ... they had issues . It 's all right . I 've prepared a short speech just in case they did . It 's just basically 2 words , and one of them 's " off . " God , I think I made a big mistake . I should never have let them go off without me , uh , on vacation . Well , until they get back , can 't we just enjoy our time alone ? Alone ? Dick , are you having second thoughts about us ? About us ? Oh , no , Mary . I don 't know what I 'd do without you . You 're the only thing keeping me sane . Ohh ! And it 's a full-time job . Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! I 'm going to get ready for work . Ya crazy lug . Ha ha ha ha ha ! I miss you all so much . And my oatmeal is so lumpy . Uh , welcome back , class . Uh , before we begin , I 'd like to hear what everybody did over their break . Uh , bug ? Me ? Uh , w-well , I spent a lot of time in a cabin in the woods with my folks .. er , that 's nice . Caryn ? Oh , uh , well , I went to the Grand Canyon with my brother and sister and - .. oh , enough about your damn families ! Didn 't anybody spend the break alone , watching reruns and eating cheese doodles while an unfathomable emptiness permeated their shriveled souls ? I saw booty call on pay-per-view . Don 't try to cheer me up , Leon . It won 't work . Is there something you 'd like to talk about , Dr. Solomon ? Talk about ? With you , Leon ? Ha ha ha ha ! Well , you know I am a psych major ... now . You are ? Well , then ... help me out . I 've made a horrible , horrible mistake , and I can 't stop hating myself for making it . Well , you know , Dr. Solomon , a person should never be sad for the mistakes he 's made . Only for the mistakes he 's about to make . Leon , that 's beautiful . It also explains why you always seem so sad . Thank you , Leon . You 've made it all so clear . I 've got to learn to let go , to move forward and focus on the thing that 's most important in my life . Meeeeeeeee ! You guys remember when I thought our brains were melting ? You remember that ? Well , it turns out we were just dreaming . But , hey , none of you caught it either . I mean , it was pretty stupid on all our parts , especially your parts . I 'm not taking the blame on this one ! Ooh ! Ooh ! I 'm sorry . Let 's not fight . I miss you ... with all my heart . I 've come here every night hoping you 'd returned ... but you never have . And so I 've come to a decision . Sally , Harry , Tommy , I can 't go on torturing myself anymore . I have to move forward with my life , the life I 've chosen with Mary . I hope you understand . And so good-bye . Good-bye , Sally . Good-bye , Tommy . Good-bye , Harry . Good-Bye , Dick ! It 's almost as if I could hear you . It sure is ! Harry ! You 're back ! You 're all back ! Oh , I missed you all so much ! Oh , Sally ! Oh , Harry ! Tommy ! Ohh ! A woman I 've never seen before ! Who 's this ? ! The big giant head sent her . Dick , I 'd like you to meet ... your new wife ! My wife ? ! Hi , honey , I 'm home ! Family meeting ! Family meeting ! No , not you . That is not my wife . So ? I 'm not your sister . Yeah , and I 'm not your brother . He 's certainly not my uncle . And I 'm not his aunt . I 'm not his father . You see ? This woman is tearing this family apart ! That 's it , meeting adjourned . That woman is not my wife . I 'm engaged to Mary . Dick , you 're gonna have to forget about her . No , this can 't be happening . This cannot be happening . It 's got to be another crazy dream . It 's not a dream , Dick . I don 't believe you . I still don 't believe you . I 'll never believe you ! All right , all right ! I believe you ! I believe you ! Can I rub that for you ? Oh , leave me alone . Yes , dear . Go away ! Thank you ! Dick , here 's the deal . The big giant head thinks your pursuit of that blonde wench is distracting you from your duties . How does he know so much about my wench ? He summoned us before him . He made us wear the truth belt . The one with the buzzer ? Bzzz ! It was horrible , Dick . So you caved , lieutenant ? Yes ! You just brought her here ? It was either that or the big giant head was going to have you sucked back to the home planet . But I 'd rather be sucked ! Oh , typical ! You know , Dick , it might not be so bad . This woman , she is 100 % wife . I mean , all she read on the way over was the joy of cooking and the joy of sex . This car is meshuggah ! Oh , yeah . And the joy of Yiddish . Did you guys realize that we have 3 holes in our heads ? 5 . 3 . 2 here and then this one . Feel the sides of your head . Ooooooh What do you know ? Just wait . There 's more . Isn 't she adorable ? We 've been calling her Janet . Well , most of us have . I 'm telling you , she looks like a zippy .. Harry , no ! I 've been telling you .. now that 's enough ! I 've heard enough . Get in the car . We 're ditching this woman . We can 't do that . Well , of course we can . I 'll just put it in drive , and we 'll fly like the wind ! Tell him . She is the big giant head 's niece . Well ... so what ? What 's the worst thing that can happen if we leave her here ? Big giant Court-Martials . Followed by big giant executions . And then 4 tiny little funerals . I don 't care . I 've chosen love over death before . Yeah , well , I haven 't . Janet , get in the car ! Damn ! Oww ! Some wife . Oh ! Food ! God , I 'm starving ! Ah . You waited . I knew you would . Ohhh ! It 's our first home . I love it ! Where 's our bedroom ? Oh , no , no , uh , that won 't be necessary . No ! I want to be the best wife ever ! Well , uh ... good luck to you . Bye , now . No , don 't fight it , sweetie . Let me love you . Where 's our boudoir ? Oh .. oh .. oh , well , uh .. uh .. long story short , we don 't have one . Ok , then . Whoa ! Uhh ! Ohh ! Ohh ! Ok ! That was fun , and you were good . I was amazing . We 're done . Now ... go enjoy a sandwich . Ok , then ! Ssssspank me . There 's nothing to eat . Well , that 's good , ' cause there 's no clean dishes . God , this place is a pigsty . Yeah , you better get on it . Oh , thanks , Tommy . That 's a nice welcome ho ... Janet . I love this room . Oh , what 's not to love ? Did you know that this is where I do all of my cooking and cleaning ? I mean , there is no greater honor for a woman . Me , I can 't get enough of it . In fact , I 'm gonna clean some dishes right now . Ha ha ha ! Oh , yeah ! Oh , but I 'm the wife . Shouldn 't I be able to do the dishes ? No . This is too much fun , Ok ? Please ! Ok , if you insist . But I still get to do the floors ! Whee ! No , no , no , no , no ! I think the floors are my turf now . Ok . There is no way you 're getting this job , sister . But you 're the wife . Good-bye , kitchen . I sure am gonna miss ya . ♪ I 'm gonna love you ♪ she 's doing the kitchen . Score ! That 's just great . Oh , come on , Dick . I 'm sorry . You know we wouldn 't have brought her back here unless we were forced to . Yeah , I guess not . At least we 're all together again , right ? Yeah . And what the hell ? We 've been through tougher times before , huh ? Oh , guys ! Ohh ! Are there aliens among us ? Tonight local residents report seeing mysterious lights in the sky over the old Sweeney farm . Whoa ! That 's the place where we landed ! Ok , all right . We have nothing to worry about . Sally cleaned up the landing site . You said you were gonna clean up the landing site . No , no , no , no , no , no . I said I was going to clean up the landing site . So you cleaned up the landing site . No . [ Gasps ] Aah ! Oh , god ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry up ! Get over there ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Oh , Don ! Sally ! You made my heart jump right into my mouth . Ohh ! Swallow . Nice flashlight . I was about to say the same thing to you . Sally , where have you been ? I thought we had a good thing going . Oh , Don , we did . I just .. I needed to take a little time , you know , to think things over . I just went on one those spontaneous trips , you know , to , um , uh ... Sea World . Turkey . Yeah , the sea world in turkey . Funny , I didn 't know there was a sea world in turkey . There 's sea worlds everywhere , Don . You just got to know where to look . Wh-wh-what are you all doing out here in the dead of the night ? Oh , well , Tommy and I were just going to go down to old man Sweeney 's creek and look for tadpoles while Harry here kept you busy . Come on , Tommy . Circle . Yeah . Sure is . You know , Harry , there are some crackpots saying that this is the work of UFOs . Hah . As if there could be intelligent life out there . What a load of hooey . Hooey ? Oh , yeah . So much bunk , you can make a bed out of it . Oh , it 's bunk , is it ? Any moron with half a brain knows that . Half a brain . I see . Well , you know , Don , it 's a big universe out there , and not just small big . Big big . Why , in the Bbelletrix system alone there are over 44 trillion planets . 44 trillion ? That 's the biggest number I 've ever heard in my life . Yeah . So don 't you think on just one of those planets that there might be some species .. Smarter than you .. that would be capable of building a spaceship ? Statistically , I suppose . Maybe there is more to this than meets the eye . Thank you , Harry . No . Thank you , Don . Aliens , huh ? Aah ! Uhh ! It 's just wheat . Just wheat . What 's that ? ! Huh ? ! So , Janet , what do you call these things we 're eating ? Pancakes . These are pancakes ? I thought pancakes were burnt globs of dough that explode with flour when you bite into them , Sally . Me , too . Good morning , dear . I 'm just putting the finishing touches on your lunch . Ow , wow , Dick . You look terrible . I feel even worse . Why ? What 's wrong ? All night long , Janet kept trying to touch my wacky place . I wound up sleeping behind the TV . All I could think of was how much I wanted to be with Mary . Shh ! You 've got to give Janet a chance . I don 't gotta do Nothin ' ! Janet . Yes , dear . You know this whole thing where I 'm supposed to be your husband and you 're supposed to be my wife ? Of course . It 's never gonna work out . And the sooner we face up to that , the happier we 'll be . There now . Don 't you feel better ? What 's happening ? I 'm all wet ! No , stop . Don 't do that . No , stop ! Stop ! I 'm leaking ! Sally ! Oh , it 's fine , honey . It 's normal . Just go dry your eyes , and we 'll shop for shoes , Ok , honey ? You cannot talk to her like that ! We 'll all get incinerated ! Well , I think we all love Mary enough to make that sacrifice . Am I right ? Nooo ! well , I do . Oh , my god ! What are these ? Pancakes . Janet 's pancakes . These are pancakes ? I thought pancakes were .. me , too ! Ok ? ! Hey , Dick .. it 's not what it looks like ! It looks wonderful ! I 've never seen you bring your lunch in a picnic basket before . Well , I 've never seen you in a thong bikini before , but there 's a first time for everything , right ? No . What did you make ? What did I make ? W-w-well , that 's a .. an easy enough , uh , question to answer . I 'll just , uh , open it up and show you . Peppered duck pate and wheat crackers , uh , Thai noodles , homemade chocolate chunk cookies . Oh ! A flower ? Well , what 's wrong with your " fiance " bringing you a flower ? Oh , that 's sweet . I 'm sorry , Mary . I know that , uh , lately I-I 've been acting a little strange . Lately ? Ok . For the last few minutes . But I 'm going to make it up to you . Nina ! Yes ? Wouldl you make a reservation for two tonight at la petite orange ? La petite orange ? Oui . What did he do ? Nothing . Oh , yeah , he did something , all right . All I 've done is to love Mary more than any other woman in this world . No matter how good their pancakes are . Have you ever done that ? Yeah . Have you ever done that ? Oh , yeah . Have you ever done that ? Yeah . Oh , Dick ! Can we do this ? Ohh ! No ! Mrs. Dubcek , what are you doing here ? I 'm talking to your ... wife . Well , I think you two have talked long enough . Janet , please ! I can get into my pajamas in my own time ! Yes , dear . You know , a woman doesn 't have to pretend that she 's your wife to sleep over , unless that 's what spikes your punch . Janet , get off me ! Go make me an English muffin pizza . Yes , my little kreplach ! Ooh ! Listen up , everyone . I have a plan . I 'll go get Janet . No , no ! It 's a plan to get rid of Janet . Right . Nice save . Dick , you can 't just kick her out . I know . But what if she wanted to leave ? She doesn 't want to leave . Not yet . But I think I can change that . Watch . Watch ... as I become the most obnoxious , repulsive creep any woman has ever met . Wow ! The transformation is astounding . I 'm impressed ! I haven 't done it yet ! But I must start immediately . Harry , go pick up Mary and take her to la petite orange . Here 's a 20 . I think it 's going to cost more than that . Well , you won 't be eating . All Righty . Your mini pizza is ready . Uh , coming , dear . It begins .

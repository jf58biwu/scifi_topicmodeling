 Hello . Uh , no , you have the wrong number . I 'm going to transfer you . But if I lose you , try again . Nina , how many students have signed up for my demonstration ? None . None ? ! Oh , wait . Erm .. None . What 's your demonstration about ? Oh , it 's a little experiment I do every year . A few students communicate without words for an entire week , and the rest of the class learns what life in a society without language was like . You mean like ... That 's good fun . No one wants to do it ? I know . You 'd think kids would be lined up for $ 10 a day . You don 't have to be sarcastic . I 'd have 50 students lined up if it wasn 't for that damn financial aid . Dick , something big has happened . It 's big , I tell ya . Big , I say . " You have been summoned to serve as a juror " in Ohio state court , Rutherford , Ohio . Such service is a privilege and a duty- - " oh , jury duty ? Throw it out . And if they call you on it , tell them it was lost in the mail . That is why the judicial system is in such a shambles . It 's people like you who are too apathetic to show up . You threw yours out last year . Well , yeah , I 'm not about to serve on a jury in the summertime . Well , winter , spring , summer , or fall , all they have to do is call and I 'll be there . Yes , I will . Well , what a huge honor . A tremendous opportunity . Well , thank you , boys . No . No , not you , Dick . Albright 's offering 10 bucks a day for people not to talk . Are you interested ? Are you kidding ? That 's double what Sally pays . Ohh ! Hi . Hi . What are you writing ? My thoughts ... how nobody understands me , how utterly alone I am , and how much it hurts me that ... I don 't care . Oh , my god ! That 's exactly how I feel . I--I 'm Sally . I 'm Seth . Sally ... would you buy me a scone ? I know , Seth . I hate that , too . Sally , thank god you 're alive . What ? Uh , a tanker full of milk jackknifed on the interstate . I thought you might be in it . No , Don , I 'm fine . I 've been here all day practicing my smoking and my accent . Well , this trip was unnecessary . You want to check out the wreck ? I 'm a cop . I can get us real close . Oh , no , thanks , Don . You don 't want to see a wreck ? Are you feeling all right ? I 'm fine . I just got to go meet this guy Seth . You know , you would really like him . Seth ? Yeah , I picked him up at the coffee shop . He talks kind of funny , but he is dreamy . He 's an artist , but he 's tortured . Tortured , huh ? There 's a lot of that going around . He 's so wonderful . You know , I have never felt this depressed before . I 'm really happy for you . Oh , look at him . How much more guilty can you get ? I mean , he 's got a gun . That 's the bailiff . Oh . Oh . Well . What about him ? His expensive suit , clutching a briefcase- - he 's a lawyer . Oh . Well , his turn will come . I 've been sitting in there for 2 hours . You 'd think they 'd at least put out a buffet . Damn ! Yeah , I lost 75 cents in that thing . Nutzit ? Cool ranch ? Barbecue . No , thanks . Maybe just one . All right , everybody , listen up . We 're about to start the jury selection process . The first case on the docket is a petty theft . Mmm ... no . I 'm looking for something a little more meaty , international software piracy , perhaps , or maybe a triple homicide . Ok . Just let the judge know when you find something that tickles you . Oh , will do . Oh , and , hey ... thanks . Harry and Tommy Solomon will demonstrate how pre - verbal societies functioned . For the next 5 days , 24 hours a day , they will function without words . Let us begin . That means I 'm hungry . That 's good , but no talking . Oh ! You can 't do that , either . Oh , not that , either ? Ok , no mouthing . Oh , sorry . All right , we got it . Yeah , it 's tough at first . Ok , yes . All right . Oh , um , oh , uh ... McHALE 'S navy . Yes ! This is great . He got it . People , what you see here today is real . It is not a setup . One more word out of you and you 're not getting paid ! You know , I have never met anyone like you , Seth . Most guys I meet have goals and careers . Not you . You 're an artist . Artist ? ! How can I paint when seagulls are choking on plastic can holders ? Ok , let 's go down to the lake , grab a 6-pack of ' em , and set ' em free . What 's the point ? It 's not going to buy a little kid in Appalachia his asthma medicine . We could organize a walkathon and get that kid some dough ! Sally , I have a play to write , and an artist lives only for his art . And he only wears black , ' cause it goes with everything . And nothing . Wow . Sir , have you ever been in an automobile collision ? Uh , no . But I am a college Physics Professor , so no matter how sophisticated the analysis gets , uh , I 'll follow it . Thank you . You 're excused . Excused to prepare for the case ? No , excused to go sit in the lobby and wait for the next case . Excuse me ? You 're excused . But I 'm a professor . That guy doesn 't even have any teeth . Sir , do you believe everything you read in the newspapers ? No , of course not . Thank you . You 're excused . Do you believe everything you read in the newspaper ? Yes . Every last word . The newspaper is my bible . Thank you . You 're welcome . You 're excused Ok , now it 's personal . This case involves " Big Rig " trucks . Do you have any feelings on " Big Rigs " ? Yes , of course . I think anyone who drives one is guilty , right ? Thank you . You 're excused . Guilty of bringing the world joy ! I love big rigs ! Do you believe everything you read in the newspaper ? Yes ! No ! I don 't know ! I don 't know what to believe anymore . You tell me what to believe and I 'll do it . He 's good with me . Me , too . Ok , Mr. Solomon , you 're seated on the case , the state vs. Chris Foster . I 'm in ? I 'M IN ? I made the cut ! I 'm on a jury ! Fine . Fine . Report here tomorrow at 8 A.M. 8 A.M. In the morning ? ! Court is now in session , Judge Harold Debelko presiding in the case the state vs. Chris Foster . All rise ! So what did this Chris Foster do ? Telemarketing fraud . Well , how will they prove .. shh ! We 're not supposed to talk . Chris Foster , snake oil salesman with the salad oil hair , an armani-clad , private-jet-piloting huckster who gets his kicks flying mom and pop into the poorhouse . Well , fasten your seat belt , Foster , I 'm bringing you down . Deplane . It 's judgment day . Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen , and the defendant will rise . That 's right . Show your ugly face , you fiend . Your honor . Oh , my god ! It 's that nice man from the vending machine . 10 guilty , 11 guilty , once again , one not guilty . Not guilty it is . What are you talking about ? Look , Foster said he wasn 't guilty . Are you calling him- - and his attorney- - a liar ? Yes ! Now , look , let 's just slow down a minute , can we ? I think we need to consider the consequences of what we 're doing here . Can you live with sending this man to jail considering the indisputable fact that Chris Foster ... is so pudgy and cute ? How pudgy and cute the defendant is has no bearing on this case . Look , this morning , no one was thirstier for vengeance than I was . But now it 's not just a crime , it 's a face , it 's a person . And he was sitting right next to us . He 's gonna know we did it . Look , our job isn 't to send him to prison . It 's simply to decide between guilt and innocence based on the facts . And there are phone records , canceled checks , and 8 witnesses all saying foster did it ! Well , if he stole this money , what did he do with it ? He supported a mistress and her child . We heard that testimony . Listen to you . In an age when a man can 't even support his family , this man supported 2 . Send him to jail ? Let 's send him to congress . Thanks , Jeff . Hey . Do I , uh , know--jeez ! Sally ! My god , what have you done ? Seth has convinced me to reject the media 's definition of what a woman is . From now on , you 'll never see me in tight jeans or a push-up bra or thong underwear . In fact , I 'm done with underwear for good . Why ? Seth helped me see who I really am . I 'm a different person now . You 're talking crazy . You don 't paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa . You don 't eat steak on thanksgiving . And you don 't muck around with Sally . Officer , why is there a boot on my car ? Some guys get a pretty lady . Some guys get the boot . Life ain 't fair . 10 hamburgers , 11 hamburgers ... one pizza . What ? I 'm in the mood for pizza . Fine ! Let 's have pizza . Aha ! If you could have pizza , couldn 't you vote innocent ? No ! Maybe you 'll all change your tune when you hear about a little thing called reasonable doubt . What 's the point ? The point is , it 's reasonable to assume that foster used the money to pay for his sick daughter 's life-threatening operation . No , it 's not . He doesn 't have a daughter . It 's not a reasonable doubt if you just make things up . Oh , so it 's truth you want ? Yes . You want the truth ? You want the truth ? Well , I can 't handle the truth ! All right , since you haven 't reached a verdict , the judge has ordered you all to spend the night sequestered at Gary 's motor lodge . Oh , good ! We can use the time to get to know each other . Hello ? Sally , I was surprised to hear from you . I want to know what 's goin ' on ? Seth 's got a lot of parking tickets . Tell the man to chill . I see . Well , you know what , Sally ? This man is the " Man . " You the Man ? I the Man . Well , why are you doin ' it ? Because , Sally , he , uh , he parks his car slightly askew . Sometimes it 's just weird - looking the way he parks it . And that 's a crime ? According to the letter of the law , it 's not technically a crime , per Se . But it 's a big faux pas . Oh ! Thank god you 're here ! I need your help . Dick , trial over ? Eliza ? No . It 's Sally . Oh . Oh , no , the trial 's not over . We 've been sequestered at Gary 's motor lodge . I 'm no law expert , but , uh , if you 've been sequestered , I don 't think you should be here . I had to come . They 're gonna convict this poor guy Chris Foster . Oh , come on , he 's guilty ! Well , how do you know ? He 's on trial , isn 't he ? Oh , he 's guilty ? Guilty of not being able to buy justice with some high-priced lawyer . Actually , he has a high-priced lawyer . He made a nice fortune swindling people . So he is guilty . Well , maybe he is , but why do I have to be the one who sends him away ? I 'm the final batter , juror number 4 . It 's the bottom of the ninth inning . The count is 11 and one . Foster 's in the penalty box waiting for the 2-minute warning . But who 's gonna blow the whistle on him ? Not the umpire ! Me ! Don 't watch a lot of baseball , do you , Dick ? What a load of cobblers . Where are you going , lieutenant ? Don 't call me that . That 's not my thing anymore . When the high commander has a problem , he turns to his second in command for counsel . That 's your responsibility . Yeah , well , responsibility is just a choke chain on your creative ... dog ! You have a job . You took on this assignment , and now it 's your sworn duty to do it right . Oh , just like you 're doing your sworn duty , juror number 4 ? Not a word ! Not a word ! I think Tommy is saying , " good work , Harry . This shelter will protect us from foul weather . " All without words . All without words . I think he 's saying he needs more masking tape on top . Yeah . No , no , that 's foul weather . Or--or masking tape . We 're all learning together . I think they want to invite the rest of the tribe into the shelter . I 'll go in there . I think they 're inviting you , Caryn . I 'm scared . It 's all right . Go ahead . Um , we 're getting a little off-track here . This is the first experiment I ever understood . Guys ! Guys ! You 're not communicating ! Stop ! Stop ! This experiment is over ! Shut up ! Get out ! Where 's our money ? Here . Get out ! So , um , you want to book us for next semester ? No ! We 'll see . We , the jury- - all of us ... in fact , every one of us ... find the defendant guilty on all counts . Does the defense want the jury polled ? Yes , your honor . As I call your number , please enter your verdict . Juror number one . Guilty . Juror number two . Guilty . Juror number three . Guilty . Juror number four . Mr. Foster , I 'd just .. Juror number four . I 'm not making any judgments .. Juror number four , how do you vote ? You are so guilty , you stupid man ! There was no way for me not to convict you , and I tried . I was so dedicated , I snuck out of the motor lodge and talked to my friends and family about this case . You spoke with others about the facts of this case during the deliberation process ? Yes . To anyone who would listen . Your honor , I move for a mistrial . Granted . Does that mean he 's not going to jail ? No , thanks to you , there 's going to be a new trial . Am I gonna be on the jury ? No . Yes ! The jury system is like a never-ending battle . Justice always depends on fair-minded humans outnumbering the bigots , fools , and cowards . Yeah , which one are you ? Fair-minded coward . Yeah . Justice is so much simpler where we come from . Oh , yeah , you simply hook the suspect to the old truth belt , and if his tube stays purple , he 's innocent . .. and blues guilty . Nice and clean . Oh , except for those times when it doesn 't change all the way , and then you get into those endless arguments about , " ooh , I think it 's magenta . " " No , that looks lavender . " Well , I guess our system isn 't perfect either . All systems are corrupt . That 's right , sunshine . What 's for dinner , Sally ? Whatever you make yourself . I 'm meetin ' Seth . Oh . Have a nice night , Princess . God , when does it end ? Ah , it 's just a phase . Yeah , she 'll grow out of it . But in the meantime , what are we gonna eat ? Bangers and mash , guv 'nor . Sure is a relief to be able to talk again . Oh , you 're telling me . Yeah . You know , during the silence , I sort of noticed how good-looking you are .

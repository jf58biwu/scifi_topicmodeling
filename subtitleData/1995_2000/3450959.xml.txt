 [ CHEESY MUSIC PLAYS ] [ DOOR CHIMES RING ] Gideon : OPEN . [ ON-SCREEN MOANING ] YOU SENT FOR ME , CAPTAIN ? YES , WE 'RE ALMOST AT THE RENDEZVOUS POINT . I FIGURED YOU 'D WANT TO BE IN ON THE MEETING . THANK YOU . I- - [ ON-SCREEN SNARLING ] [ SNARLS ] WELL ... THERE 'S SOMETHING YOU DON 'T SEE EVERY DAY . [ SNARLING CONTINUES ] WHERE 'D YOU GET THIS ? MR. EILERSON SAID THAT HE DIDN 'T HAVE TIME TO PRINT UP HIS LATEST REPORT , SO HE GAVE IT TO ME ON DATA CRYSTAL . AFTER I FINISHED WATCHING IT , I FORGOT TO TURN IT OFF AND FOUND THIS AT THE END . THERE 'SSNOW WHITE AND THE 7 NARNS , WHO 'S YOUR LITTLE PAKMORAT ? OTHERS . HE MUST HAVE RECORDED OVER AN OLD DATA CRYSTAL WITHOUT ERASING IT FIRST . AND YOU 'RE GOING TO PULL THIS OUT THE VERY NEXT TIME HE GETS SNOTTY WITH US , AREN 'T YOU ? NO , NO . THAT WOULD BE FAR TOO EASY . NO , NO . THAT WOULD BE FAR TOO EASY . LEAVE IT TO ME , DR. CHAMBERS . GIVEN SOMEONE AS REPRESSED AS OUR MR. EILERSON , I CAN PLAY THIS ONE OUT FOR DAYS . [ SNARLS ] AS A DOCTOR , I HAVE TO SAY THAT 'S TOTALLY UNREALISTIC . AN ALIEN LIFE FORM LIKE THE PAKMORAT IS NOT BIOLOGICALLY EQUIPPED TO INTERFACE WITH HUMANS IN THAT KIND OF- - [ ON-SCREEN MOANING ] Woman : OHHHH ! THAT 'S AN AMAZING THING--TECHNOLOGY . THAT 'S AN AMAZING THING--TECHNOLOGY . [ DOOR OPENS ] CAPTAIN GIDEON . I AM ANLA-SHOK TRULANN . AN HONOR . THIS IS MY MEDICAL OFFICER DR. CHAMBERS . DOCTOR . PLEASE SIT . SO WHAT 'S THIS ALL ABOUT ? YOUR MESSAGE SAID THAT YOU HAD INFORMATION CRITICAL TO OUR MISSION , BUT THAT 'S ALL . IT WAS ALL I COULD RISK ON AN OPEN CHANNEL . LIKE ALL THE OTHER RANGERS , MY CREW AND I DIVIDE OUR TIME BETWEEN ENFORCING THE RULES OF THE INTERSTELLAR ALLIANCE AND LISTENING FOR ANY INFORMATION THAT MIGHT AID YOUR SEARCH FOR A CURE FOR YOUR PEOPLE . IN THE PAST , THOSE TWO HAVE NEVER COME INTO CONFLICT . THAT HAS NOW CHANGED . I 'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND . THE ALLIANCE AND THE RANGERS EXIST TO CREATE THE PEACE , TO ENSURE THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS UPHELD AT ALL TIMES . THE INFORMATION I HAVE WILL REQUIRE YOU TO VIOLATE THOSE LAWS . YOU WILL HAVE TO INTERFERE IN THE AFFAIRS OF ANOTHER RACE , HELP A FUGITIVE ESCAPE JUSTICE , TRAFFIC IN STOLEN MERCHANDISE , AND BREAK ANY NUMBER OF LOCAL LAWS . SO THE QUESTION BECOMES ... HOW FAR ARE YOU PREPARED TO GO ? HOW FAR ARE YOU PREPARED TO GO ? THERE ARE 10 BILLION LIVES AT STAKE , TRULANN . I 'LL BREAK ANY LAW I HAVE TO IF IT MEANS SAVING THEM . THEN I MAY HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU , CAPTAIN . BUT UNDERSTAND THAT AFTER I LEAVE HERE , I WILL DENY THIS CONVERSATION EVER TOOK PLACE . YOU WILL BE ALONE IN THIS . YOU WILL BE ALONE IN THIS . I 'VE BEEN ALONE BEFORE . I 'VE BEEN ALONE BEFORE . I 'M IN , ALL THE WAY . I 'M IN , ALL THE WAY . MATTHEW GIDEON , CAPTAIN . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR .

ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS . Questioner : WHO DO YOU SEEK ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? CAPTAIN , LISTEN ... I WAS WONDERING IF YOU 'D HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK OVER THE DATA CRYSTAL THAT I GAVE YOU THE OTHER DAY . HUH ? OH ... NO , I 'VE BEEN BUSY . WHY ? WELL , I WAS GOING OVER MY FILES , AND I THINK I MIGHT 'VE GIVEN YOU A CORRUPT DATA CRYSTAL . I 'VE BEEN BANGING THE SAME CRYSTALS AROUND WITH ME THIS LAST YEAR . THEY GET DAMAGED . YOU KNOW HOW IT IS . I 'D HATE TO SEE YOU READ A CORRUPT DATA CRYSTAL INTO YOUR SYSTEM . IT CAN CAUSE ALL KINDS OF HAVOC . TRUE , BUT , UH ... THEN , IT TAKES ALL KINDS , DOESN 'T IT , MR. EILERSON ? HMM ? YES . ANYWAY ... IF YOU COULD GET THE DATA CRYSTAL BACK TO ME AT YOUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY WITHOUT LOADING IT INTO YOUR SYSTEM , I COULD GET YOU A BETTER COPY . I REALLY DON 'T- - I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS AFTER THE MEETING . WE REALLY DON 'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME . WE REALLY DON 'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME . WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED SOME PROMISING INFORMATION ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL . HIS NAME IS NATCHOK VAR FROM MARATA 7 . ACCORDING TO REPORTS , OUR SUBJECT DOWNLOADED ALL THE IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS RACE ONTO A SERIES OF HIGH COMPRESSION DATA CRYSTALS AND THEN ... TOOK OFF . OUR SOURCE BELIEVES THAT HE INTENDS TO SELL THAT INFORMATION TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER . THAT 'S ONE HELL OF A SECURITY BREECH . THE MARATTI GOVERNMENT HAS PUT A PRICE ON HIS HEAD FOR ANYONE WHO CAN RETURN HIM AND THE DATA CRYSTALS TO HIS HOMEWORLD . WE DON 'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION HE 'S CARRYING . ONLY THAT IT COVERS CENTURIES . THE CHANCE TO GET OUR HANDS ON SOMETHING THAT EXTENSIVE IS TOO GOOD TO PASS UP . EVEN IF THERE 'S NOT ANY USEFUL MEDICAL DATA , THERE MAY BE INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER CIVILIZATIONS THAT WE HAVEN 'T ENCOUNTERED YET . IT COULD SAVE US YEARS OF WORK LOOKING FOR THEM . SO WHAT 'S THE PROBLEM ? I MEAN , WE FIND HIM AND WE MAKE HIM AN OFFER . HE 'S ALREADY BEEN CAPTURED BY BOUNTY HUNTERS ON PRAXIS 9 . BY BOUNTY HUNTERS ON PRAXIS 9 . THE MARATTI KNOW HE 'S BEEN CAPTURED , AND THEY 'RE EN ROUTE TO PICK HIM UP . BUT WE ARE CLOSER TO THE TARGET . WE COULD GET THERE BEFORE THEY ARRIVE . WE 'LL GO IN , SPRING HIM AND THE DATA , AND WITH LUCK , GET OUT BEFORE THE MARATTI SHOW UP . THEN WE 'LL NEGOTIATE FOR THE INFORMATION . WHERE DOES THE ALLIANCE STAND WITH ALL THIS ? PRAXIS IS OUTSIDE ALLIANCE JURISDICTION . AND THE MARATTI AREN 'T MEMBERS , SO WE 'RE ON OUR OWN . WE HAVE TO ENTER SOMEONE ELSE 'S SPACE , CONDUCT AN ILLEGAL RAID TO FREE A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE , AND BUY STOLEN DATA . SO IF ANY OF US IS HURT , KILLED , OR CAPTURED , NO ONE 'S GOING TO BAIL US OUT OF TROUBLE . I VOTE NO . YOU SAID YOURSELF THAT HE STOLE THIS INFORMATION FROM HIS OWN PEOPLE . EVEN IF WE DO MANAGE TO GET HIM OUT , IT STILL MEANS DEALING WITH ... WELL , A THIEF . AND YOUR PROBLEM WITH THAT IS ? IT 'S NOTHING PERSONAL . YOUR PROFESSION IS A FINE ONE . THE SECOND OLDEST ONE ON RECORD , I DO BELIEVE . BUT WE HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE . YOU 'RE JUST AFRAID TO GO INTO A SITUATION WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF YOUR GOVERNMENT . AN ENTIRE PLANET IS AT RISK AND ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOUR OWN SKIN . I RESENT YOUR IMPLICATIONS- - Gideon : MR. EILERSON ... DUREENA ... OBVIOUSLY WE ARE WALKING A VERY FINE LINE HERE BETWEEN WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS MORAL . AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH , I DON 'T KNOW WHICH THIS IS . I ONLY KNOW THAT IT 'S NECESSARY . IF I WASN 'T PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER I HAD TO DO IN ORDER FOR US TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION , I WOULD HAVE NEVER SIGNED ON IN THE FIRST PLACE . SO WE 'RE GOING . UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME MORE THOUGHTS TO GIVE US ON MORALITY , MR. EILERSON . TO GIVE US ON MORALITY , MR. EILERSON . NO . NO OTHER THOUGHTS , CAPTAIN . NO OTHER THOUGHTS , CAPTAIN . Matheson : APPROACHING PRAXIS SYSTEM . Matheson : APPROACHING PRAXIS SYSTEM . THIS IS PRAXIS 9 . IT 'S A COMMERCIAL PLANETARY COLONY , CONSISTING OF 4 DOMED CITIES IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE . ITS OUTSIDE ATMOSPHERE IS EXTREMELY TOXIC , WITH HIGH LEVELS OF CARBON MONOXIDE AND METHANE . THIS DOME , THE LARGEST , IS THE CAPITAL . IT 'S ALSO THE ONLY ONE WITH A WORKING SPACEPORT , SO IF OUR TARGET IS ANYWHERE , HE 'S PROBABLY IN THERE . THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH THE DOME ARE GETTING IN AND GETTING OUT . IF WE GO IN THE FRONT DOOR , THEY 'RE GONNA KNOW WHO WE ARE , AND I DOUBT THE ALLIANCE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT . ONCE IN , IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS , THEY CAN LOCK DOWN THE SHUTTLE AND SPACEPORT AND KEEP US FROM ESCAPING . THEN YOU 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DROP ME AS FAR FROM THE MAIN DOME AS NECESSARY TO AVOID DETECTION . I 'LL FIND MY OWN WAY IN . CAPTAIN , I MUST PROTEST- - WE 'RE ABOUT TO BREAK ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN LAWS . I WON 'T LET ANYONE TAKE THE RAP FOR THAT IF THINGS GO BADLY . IT 'S MY DECISION AND MY SHIP AND I 'M GOING . THEN I 'M GOING WITH YOU . DUREENA ... YOU NEED ME TO GET IN AND OUT OF THERE WITHOUT BEING CAPTURED . I KNOW YOU 'RE GOOD AT THIS SORT OF THING- - Dureena : I 'VE BEEN TO PRAXIS 9 BEFORE .

THERE WERE 6 DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS- - FOR MAINTENANCE , AIR FLOW CONTROL , OTHERS- - SO THEY COULD TRACK WHO WAS GOING IN AND OUT .

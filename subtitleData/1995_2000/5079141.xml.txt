 Young people from all over the globe are joining up to fight for the future . I 'm doing my part . I 'm doing my part too . They 're doing their part . Are you ? Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world . Service guarantees citizenship . The Bugs send another meteor our way . But this time we ' re ready . Planetary defenses are better than ever . Klendathu , source of the Bug attacks ... orbits a twin-star system whose ... gravitational forces produce an unlimited supply of Bug meteorites ... in the form of this asteroid belt . To ensure our safety ... Klendathu must be eliminated . We break net now and take you live ... to Klendathu , where the invasion has begun . DXQ uplink on . Two , one , you 're on ! We 've landed on what Cap Troopers ... . are calling Big " K " , with the Sixth Mobile Infantry division . It 's an ugly , Bug planet . A planet hostile to life as we know it . Help me ! - Die ! Die ! - Come on ! Go ! - Keep moving . - Get out of here now ! Oh , God ! Rico . Pay attention . Sorry , Mr. Rasczak . Let 's sum up . This year we explored ... the failure of Democracy , how the social scientists brought our world ... to the brink of chaos . We talked about the veterans , how they took control ... and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since . You know these facts . But have I taught you anything of value ? You . Why are only citizens allowed to vote ? It 's a reward . What the Federation gives you ... - for doing federal service . - No . No ! Something given ... . has no value . When you vote you are exercising political authority . You 're using force . Force , my friends , is violence . The supreme authority for which all other authority is derived . My mother says violence never solves anything . Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would say about that . You . They probably wouldn 't say anything . - Hiroshima was destroyed . - Correct . Naked force has resolved more issues ... throughout history than any other factor . The contrary opinion that violence never solves anything ... is wishful thinking at its worst . People who forget that always pay . What 's the moral difference , if any ... between a civilian and a citizen ? A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety ... . of the body politic , defending it with his life . - A civilian does not . - Exact words of the text . But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ? I don 't know . Of course you don 't . I doubt anyone here ... . would recognize civic virtue if it bit you in the ass ! Not here . Come on . Let 's see if they posted the math final . - We gonna take Tesla ? - We 're gonna kill ' em . First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores . Wish me luck . Way to go . Good job . Your turn . Hold on . I want to talk to Marco . His sister 's at Fleet . - Hi , Carmen . - What 'd you hear about Roxy ? She made pilot . Thirty-five percent . Very nice . Look at that . Thirty - five percent , ladies and gentlemen . - Big numbers . - Carl . Sorry . So you haven 't done it yet ? Don 't lie . - I 'm not in any hurry . - Others are waiting . - Did you read her mind ? - Don 't have to . I know what she wants . Yeah , but I want Carmen . Aw , you got it bad . Hey , don 't forget about this afternoon . He 's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss . Get out of here . - Marco 's sister made pilot ! - So will you . I mean , imagine flying a half a million tons of starship . You gotta have nerves of steel . - You do . Let 's see how yours hold up . - You may begin ! Oh , come on . It 's just a Bug . Better put your goggles on . Just a Bug . Ha ! We humans like to think we are nature 's finest achievement . I 'm afraid it just isn 't true . This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways . It reproduces in vast numbers ... has no ego , has no fear ... doesn 't know about death ... and , so , is the perfect , selfless member of society . But humans have created art , mathematics , and interstellar travel . True , but before you let that go to your head ... take the example of the Arachnids ... a highly evolved insect society . By human standards they are relatively stupid ... . but their evolution stretches over millions of years . - And now ... - Take this . They can colonize planets ... by hurling their spore into space . Yeah , I think we got it . There 's the heart ... . and here 's the stomach . Nerves of steel . Huh ? Don 't think about it . Just go on instinct . Try to visualize it . I see the ace of spades . Statistically speaking , you should have accidentally guessed right by now . Try another . So , my psychic abilities are zero and I 'm unlucky . No , luck 's not a factor . No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren 't . Who knows ? Maybe it 's a new stage of human evolution . That 's why they do these kind of Federal studies . Cyrano ! Ah , shit . Time out . Aw , he just wants some attention . You don 't play with him anymore . Go bug Mom , Cyrano . How do you make him do that ? I gave him the impression there 's a grub crawling up my mom 's leg . He 's on a mission to go eat it . Get off my leg ! I sure hope you don 't do anything like that to me . Don 't be afraid . Can 't do human . Yet . All right ! Touchdown , Tigers . The score is now 41 to 38 . Tigers lead with 2 : 46 remaining here at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena . - Time out : Giants . - Are you all right ? - Much better now . - Good . Hey ! Your helmet ! So , what are you doing after the game ? Everyone 's going to the dance . Aren 't you ? - It 's my last night as a civilian . - Number 12 , let 's go ! - Ship off to Tereshkova tomorrow . - You 're going to the Fleet Academy ? - That 's where I want to go ! - Come on , number 12 ! Let 's play ball . Don 't get any ideas about my girlfriend ! All is fair in love and war . - Giants ! Giants ! - Johnny ! Yeah ! Just under 22 seconds remaining . All right , let 's go . Irving , Latham , cover the rook . Perry , fake left . Ricoli , you go long . Rico , flip six , three hole . Got it ? - Hey ! - What ? You 're drifting ! Flip six , three hole on one . Got it ? Just throw me the ball , Diz . Ready ? Break ! Two ! Six ! - Climb left ! - Screen ! Go , go , go ! All right ! He 's in there ! It 's over ! Who said you could grow up so fast ? Mom , don 't get mushy . This came for you today . I presume , at your request . A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service . Well , you ' re not thinking of applying ? Have you lost your mind ? I 'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life . It 's a term of service . It 's not a career . I just want to get out on my own ... see the galaxy for a couple of years . Johnny , people get killed in the Federal Service . Who gave you this idea ? It 's that teacher , isn 't it ? What 's his name ? You know the one I 'm talking about . Silly name . There should be a law against using a school as a recruiting station . Rasczak doesn 't do that at all . He sort of discourages you . Well , that 's good ... 'cause you 're going to Harvard and that 's the end of it . It 's my decision , not yours . - Oh , is that how it is ? - Wait , you two . Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this . Can you guess what it is ? You wanted to see the galaxy ? How about a trip to the Outer Rings ? Zegema Beach . Huh ? - I 've always wanted to go there . - Good . Then it 's all settled . Sure . Don 't go away . I 'm just gonna go see Mr. Rasczak . Hey , Rico . You wanna dance ? Actually , Diz , I promised Carmen ... Aw . Come on . Too bad for her if she 's not around . It 's sad ... after tonight , most of us ... probably won 't see each other again . So , you still gonna play for Rio ? Yeah , looks like . Unless Tokyo lets me start . Well , anyone who gets you is lucky . Johnny , how come we never got together ? Can 't we just be friends , Diz ? Sure . Look , Diz , I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak . Well , you 'd better hurry up if you want to catch him . You 're the best . What is it , Rico ? I want to thank you . Your class was the best one I had this year . Well , it 's really not my job to please . I just hope you learned something . I want to join up . I think I got what it takes to be a citizen . Good for you . Go find out . Well , my parents are against it . I know it 's my choice . I was wondering . What would you do if you were me ? Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has . Use that freedom . Make up your own mind , Rico . But I have not been to paradise No , I have not been to paradise Watch the days go by All is well Don 't exaggerate . You have really beautiful eyes . This is Zander . We know each other from the game . - No hard feelings ? - Oh , none at all . We won . Come on , Carmen . It 's the last dance . - Maybe I 'll see you at the Academy . - Yeah . Who knows ? Good luck . Zander 's going for pilot too . You two have so much in common . Are you jealous ? Well , maybe . You don 't have to be jealous . No , I have not been to paradise Break it up , you two . There 's a place for that sort of thing . I 've been thinking , and I 'm gonna do it , Carmen . I 'm gonna go for Federal Service . That 's great ! Carl and I are signing up tomorrow . Come with us . I will . Talk about Watch the days go by My father 's not home tonight . All is well Twenty-third century dies Of my own free will ... after having been duly advised and warned ... of the meaning and consequences of this oath ... . enroll in the Federal Service for not less than two years ... . and as much longer as may be required by the needs of the Federation . Fresh meat for the grinder , eh ? - So , how 'd you kids do ? - I 'm gonna be a pilot . Well , good for you . We need all the pilots we can get . - Hey , did you get Starside R D ? - No . - I don 't believe it . - I got Games and Theory . Games and Theory ? That 's Military Intelligence . Way to go , Carl . Next time we meet , I 'll probably have to salute you . What about you , son ? - Infantry , sir . - Good for you . Mobile Infantry made me the man I am today . All recruits report to the Federal Transportation Hub ... within 24 hours . Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service . Let 's make a vow . No matter what . We 'll always be friends . I 'll go for that . Well , chances are we 'll never see each other again . We 'll be millions of light-years away from each other . But , uh , yeah , sure . Why not ? You 'll resign . That 's all there is to it ! It may look bad , but if that 's the worst you suffer , then that 's fine . - I won 't quit . - I 'm telling you , you will . You 're not going back . You 're going on vacation ! I am not going on vacation ! I want to be a citizen . - It 's my decision . - You walk out that door ... . you are cut off , young man , understand ? All right ! That 's it ! You are cut off ! Johnny , why won 't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean that much to you ? Well , yeah . Sure . I hope so . I hope you don 't ruin your life over some silly little girl ... . who wants to look handsome in a uniform . Don 't talk about Carmen that way ! Your attention , please . Outbound troops 13-A ... Do you have everything ? Great . - You 're late . - My dad h ad to help me pack . Suddenly , he 's afraid he 's never gonna see me again or something . It was sweet , but it took forever . Anyway , I guess I 'm ready to go . $ " Welcome To Federal Transport Hub 39 " Yeah , me too . I 'm wearing everything I own . I 'm sorry your parents were mad . Who cares ? The Federation 'll give me everything I need for ... . the next two years , right ? You talk to Carl ? Yeah , he left this morning . Couldn 't say where . Oh , it 's exciting going away . But I 'm scared . Aren 't you ? I 'm gonna miss you . I 'm gonna miss you too . I love you . Outbound group 94-A , Tereshkova , all sections ... That 's me . Just say it once . Try it on for size . I love you . - Don 't forget to write . - I won 't . N " A World That Works " Fully automatic Morita . Who wants to hold it ? - Me ! Me ! - Citizen rule . People making a better tomorrow . A murderer was captured this morning and tried today . Guilty . Sentence : Death . Execution : Tonight at 6 : 00 . All net , all channels . Would you like to know more ? If you think you 're psychic ... . maybe you are . Federal studies are being conducted in your community . Every school kid knows that Arachnids are dangerous . However , Mormon extremists disregarded Federal warnings ... and established Port Joe Smith deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone . Too late , they realized that Dantana had already been chosen by other colonists ... Arachnids . - One , two , three , four ! - Most of you will not live ... to be in the Mobile Infantry . The trouble is , you are not good enough the way you are . Hands at your side ! Chin up ! I am your senior drill instructor , Career Sergeant Zim . Suck in that gut ! Feet together ! To think this had to happen to me . What a bunch of apes . No , strike that ! You don 't rate that good ! Never in my life have I seen ... Do you think I 'm funny ? Do I make you laugh ? Do you think ... - I 'm a comedian , son ? - I 'm sorry . The first words and the last words out of your stinking holes will be " sir " ! - Do you get me ? - Sir , yes , sir ! See that armory ? Run around it ! Run , I said ! - Bronski , keep pace ! - Move ! Now , any time you think I 'm being too tough ... any time you think I 'm being unfair ... . any time you miss your mommy , quit ! Sign form 1240-A , grab your gear and take a stroll down Washout Lane . - Do you get me ? - Sir , yes , sir ! Pathetic ! I wonder if there 's a handful of guts in the whole bunch of you . Now ... who here thinks they got what it takes to knock me down ? Sir , I guess maybe I do , sir ! - You all right , son ? - Sir , yes , sir ! It 's my arm . I reckon it 's broken , sir . Medic ! Pain is in your mind ! - Who 's next ? - Sir . Recruit Flores reporting for duty , sir . You specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training unit ? - Sir , I heard it was the best , sir ! - It is the best . But what makes you think you 're good enough ? Now , that 's the kind of gal who makes squad leader , That 's my job you 're talking about . You know , I 'd like to kill that Sergeant Zim . Whoa ! Improper attitude ! They 'll kick you out for talking like that . Bye-bye . There you go , down Washout Lane . Yup . Either you got what it takes , or you don 't . - Hey , there is a line ! - Wait your turn , Ace . Hey . At ease , little soldier . It 's all the same muck . Get in line like everyone else . You got some guts for a rich kid . I guess you and me could be buddies . What do ya say ? I 'm honored . Of course you are ! Everybody should have a friend like me . Come on , Ace ! Back of the line . Man . - What a jerk , man . - Tough guy . Hey , Rico . Want to sit together ? No , thanks , Diz . What 's your malfunction , Rico ? You are . I joined up to get out on my own and you had to tag along . You think I joined the Mobile Infantry because of you ? You saying you didn 't ? Forget about it , Ace . You don 't stand a chance . What makes you even think you 're going to make squad leader , Rico ? Something I 've got you don 't . - You rich kids are all the same . - It isn 't about that . It 's about who 's the best . First squad ! Sir , I don 't understand . Who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway ? All you gotta do is push a button . Sir . Cease fire ! Put your hand on that wall , trooper ! The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand . Medic ! Ah , well . We all have one thing in common . We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infantry . Breckinridge , what 's your excuse ? My family 's all farmers . I hate farming . Mobile Infantry ? It 's like pure picnic by comparison . All right , so they grow ' em big and dumb on the farm planet , huh ? - And pretty ! - I like big . - Djana 'd , what about you ? - Oh , I 'm goin ' in for politics . And , you know , you gotta be a citizen for that , so here I am . - Ah , you want some responsibility . - Yeah . Shujumi ! Come on , let 's keep it going . I got into Harvard , but my father says , " Forget it . " It 's gonna cost an arm and a leg , you know ? If I serve ... - Federation pays my way ! - I want to have babies . It 's a lot easier to get a license if you serve . I 'm going career . Officer 's training . All the way . Future sky marshal . All right , Rico , your turn . - Who asked you to be so nosy ? - What , I 'm the bad guy ? I 'm gonna be a writer . A writer 's got a right to be nosy . Hey , Flores . You know Rico from Buenos Aires . What 's his story ? He 's here because of a girl . Lover boy ! - He 's gettin ' me excited ! - He 's gonna blow ! Is it you ? This is where we live . Not much . But it 's home . Right there , that 's my bunk , where I dream about you every night . Boot 's pretty tough . Sometimes , I think I won 't make it . But then I think about what you 're doing , and I try harder . Do you mind ? We try harder , baby ! Who knows ? They might even make me squad leader . Uh-oh . Well , I better pack it in . - I love you Carmen . - Write me ! I 'm gonna kill you guys ! Bye ! Write me ! Orbit in five , Ibanez ! First one there gets to fly . - Locking it down . - Wait ! Wait ! Oh , no ! Not Ibanez again ! She 's crazy ! Ready ! Go ! Deploying wings . How come you 're in such a good mood ? Huh ? 'Cause today I get to fly that . Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty , ma 'am . - Take the number two chair , Ibanez . - Yes , ma 'am . - Identify . - Ibanez , " T " - three-two-five- " A , " clear . What are you doing here ? I 'm the guy who 's gonna teach you to fly this crate . Assistant instructor . Should I call you " sir " ? Only when I give you an order . - Prepare for departure . - It 's amazing . Us running into each other like this . Maybe it 's fate . Maybe not . I heard about this crazy girl ... . coming through the Academy . Solid math , a little wild on the stick ... . but a natural . When it turned out to be you , I just made sure we would run into each other . Rodger Young , cleared for undocking and departure . All right , Ibanez . Take her out . All systems go . In simulation , my supervisors could never keep up . Well , this isn 't simulation anymore , so take her out easy , Cadet . Yes , sir . Five meters from object . Three meters from object . Clear . - Don 't exceed port speed . - Or what ? Or they revoke your flight status ... and mine . Your career is in my hands . Steady as she goes , Number Two . Prepare for warp . - Yes , ma 'am . - Number One , design for Jupiter orbit . All crew , all sections . Stand by to cut in C-drive ... Stellar drive in ... five .

We run a flip six , three hole play , and you can score . - Cover me ! - You got it . Now ! - Thanks , buddy ! - Bastard ! The kid 's got some moves . Give him a squad . See what he can do . Someone 's got to teach you guys how to play some pool here . Look at him . You ever seen anybody so pleased with himself ? Well , Zim must 've had to choose someone to be his brown-nose . I couldn 't have done it without you , Diz . Friends ? Friends . - Mail call ! Levy ! - Yeah , that 's me . - Shujumi ! - Here . - Rico , - Here . - Breckinridge . - Here . - Nyla . - Yeah , here I am . Oh , great . My dad . That 's all , folks . Hi , Johnny . I 'm sorry I haven 't written you sooner , but ... Oh , Rico ! You don 't deserve that ! They 've really got us going . They must have made you squad leader by now . And if they haven 't , tell ' em to talk to me . See ? All it takes is the love of a good woman . Now , that is a woman ! Look at that . Isn 't it beautiful ? I love it out here . That 's also the problem , because ... I think I 'm gonna go career . I want a command ... a ship of my own and , you know ... I don 't think that 's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me , Johnny . Jeez . I know that 's not what you wanted to hear ... but , uh ... I have to follow my heart . I 'm sorry . Write me . All right ? Write me . So that I 'll know we 'll always be friends . Funny how they always want to be friends after they rip your guts out . Yeah . Well , that 's what I deserve . What are you talkin ' about ? I joined up for her . I wouldn 't even be here if it wasn 't for her . What are you talkin ' about ? You made squad leader on your own . And , hey , you still got me to kick around . Fun and games are over , children ! You will be firing live ammunition in a simulated combat environment . You will exercise extreme caution on my assault course ! - Do you get me ? - Sir , yes , sir ! Rico . Take ' em out . First fire team with me . Next team in ten seconds ! Maximum score has been 280 . I expect you to do better . Go ! Stay low ! Keep moving ! Shujumi , stay down ! Goddamn it , Breckinridge ! Clear my line of fire ! It 's my helmet . It 's all screwed up . - You 're gonna blow the score ! - Man ! - Dumb shit ! - Diz , stay put ! What 's the problem ? Damn thing keeps getting in my way ! How come whenever something goes wrong , it 's always you , Breckinridge ? - It must be ' cause I 'm big and dumb ! - Yeah , right ! Medic ! Rico ! You are relieved of squad command ! Rico , did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ? He reported a helmet malfunction , and I asked him to show me . Sir . Are you rated to repair the M-3 tactical helmet , Rico ? Sir , no , sir ! Why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ? Sir , I needed everyone in my squad operational , sir ! I wanted to win , sir ! Sergeant , we 've already lost two recruits over this incident . Think there 's any possibility of salvaging this man ? Yes , sir , I do . All right . We 'll try administrative punishment . Prisoner , halt ! Bite down on this , son . It helps . I know . For incompetence of command ... for failure to abide by safety regulations ... during a live fire exercise ... . for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate ... Recruit Trainee John Rico is sentenced to administrative punishment . Ten lashes . You may carry out the sentence . One ! Two ! Three ! Four ! Five ! Six ! Seven ! Eight ! Nine ! Ten ! All structures secure . EB X is high-normal . Switch to slave on my mark . Thanks . You read my mind . Oh , third watch always seems to last forever . I don 't know . Depends on who you 're spending it with . Something 's wrong . - There ! - No . I replotted the course . It 's more efficient this way . Three weeks aboard a starship and you think you can lick my navs ? Check it . You know , I was talking with Captain Deladier and , uh , she said ... Don 't change the subject . Am I right ? Yeah . You 're right . So , what did the captain say ? She thinks we should team up officially ... and crew for her . - You and me , huh ? - We 're good together , Carmen . We 're way ahead of the curve in every department . I can anticipate you . You know what I want . No . What do you want ? There 's a gravity field out there . - Run a scan . Sensors on . - There . - Gravity at two - two-five and rising . - Report ! We are in the path of an unidentified object moving toward us at high speed . Profile suggests an asteroid , ma 'am . Impact : six seconds ! Emergency evasion ! Three ... . two ... fire ! Close compartment 21 ! Where 'd it come from ? It came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone , ma 'am . Number Four , contact Fleet . Tell them a loose asteroid 's headed their way . Communications are down , ma 'am . They 're gone . Damage assessment ! Hull 's compromised . We 're lucky to be alive , ma 'am . Luck didn 't have anything to do with it . We have a hell of a flight team . It really stinks , you goin ' . Yeah , well , the Mobile Infantry 'll just have to get along without me . I don 't get it . You took your licks . If they didn 't want you , they would 've kicked you out . I joined up for the wrong reasons . I got a guy killed . I figure that kinda proves I don 't have what it takes . Your call 's goin ' through . Take it there . - Hi , Mom . - Bill , pick it up . It 's Johnny . - Dad . - Where 's your uniform ? It 's just good to hear from you . How are you , son ? It 's not really working out here for me , Dad . I was thinking ... I was hoping it would be all right if I came home . Well , of course . You should come home immediately . - I 'm sorry . I 've been an idiot . - Don 't say that . Just come on home . We 'll talk things out . We love you , son . - My , what 's that ? - Looks like rain . - This time of the year ? - Sure is dark ... Your transmission has been terminated due to atmospheric interference . Please try your call again later . I 'II see ya . You take that stroll down Washout Lane . You 're only proving one thing . What 's that , Diz ? That you don 't have what it takes to be a citizen . - Sound off . - Stand by . Left , right , left ! Hold it ! What 's happening ? We got bombed ! Lost the whole city ! Hey , what 's goin ' on ? - Hey , Kitten , what 's goin ' on ? - War ! We 're goin ' to war ! The devastation we are seeing is un paralleled . Judging from early estimates , millions dead , a city in ruins . Is that Geneva ? Goddamn Bugs whacked us , Johnny . The meteor was shot out of orbit by Bug plasma ... that derived from Klendathu . The Arachnid 's home planet . Nothing lives in what was once called ... the Latin paradise . Oh , Johnny , that 's us . Buenos Aires has been wiped off the Earth . It 's home . The Federal Council met moments ago and voted unanimously ... for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat . - I 'm serious . I 'll go anywhere . - Forget it , Zim . We need you here . - I want combat , sir ! - The only way you 'll see combat ... is if you bust yourself to private . Get me ? Yes , sir . I get you . - Sir ! - What do you want , Rico ? I wish to reconsider my request to drop out , sir . You already signed your 1240-A . - It wouldn 't be legal . - Major , I know it was wrong . I didn 't learn from one mistake . And I made another . Sir . You made your decision , son . Sir , my family ... my whole family ... . was in Buenos Aires , sir . Is this your signature , Rico ? Sir , yes , it is , sir ! Doesn 't look like it to me . Carry on , Private . Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow ... then anger . The only good Bug is a dead Bug ! In Geneva . The Federal Council convenes . We must meet the threat ... . with our valor , our blood ... indeed with our very lives ... to ensure that human civilization . Not insect ... . dominates this galaxy now and always . Sky Marshall Dienes announces plans for an offensive against Klendathu ... source of the Bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires . Every day , federal scientists ... are looking for new ways to kill Bugs . Your basic Arachnid warrior isn 't too smart ... but you can blow off a limb ... . and it 's still 86 % combat effective . Here 's a tip : Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good . Would you like to know more ? Everyone 's doing their part . Are you ? The war effort needs your effort at work , at home , in your community . We now break net and take you live ... to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga deep inside ... the Arachnid Quarantine Zone , where the men and women ... of the Federal Armed Services prepare to attack . DXQ uplink on two , one . You 're on . No one here in the AQZ knows when the invasion of Klendathu will occur ... but everyone 's talking about it , and the talk says tomorrow . Here 's a bunch of M.I. Kids who look like they eat Bugs for lunch . Yum , yum , yum . So , trooper , you 're not too worried about fighting the Arachnids ? Shoot a nuke down a Bug hole , you got a lot of dead Bugs . Am I right ? I just hope it 's not over before we get some . Some say the Bugs were provoked by the intrusion of humans ... into their natural habitat ... that a " live and let live " policy is preferable to war with the Bugs . Let me tell you something . I 'm from Buenos Aires ... and I say kill ' em all ! Big bad Bugs , huh ? - Hey , guys , we ought to get tattoos . - Let 's all get cut together . - What do I want a tattoo for ? - What ? Your skin 's too pretty ? Come on . Everybody 's doing it . At ease . Guess I ought to lose the hat when I 'm off duty . My mother was right about you . - You look great in a uniform . - You look pretty good yourself . So , what do you hear ? You know about anyone who made it out of B.A. Alive ? Most of the time , I don 't think about it . Like it happened to someone else . Then it hits me , and I can 't stop crying . Well , we 're still alive . You 've got to be happy about that . You don 't look very happy to see me . Should I be ? Johnny , it 's different now . We 're at war . I think what I did was probably ... the best thing for both of us . Everything coposetic , Lieutenant ? Zander , you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now . We 're the best in the Fleet . I get it . This is the part that 's best for both of us . Don 't do me any more favors . - Johnny , wait . - For get it . He 's Mobile Infantry . See , when you 're trained to kill , it just doesn 't pay to be polite . You got something to say about the Mobile Infantry ? I think you heard me . You wanna make something of it , Private ? Not with an officer . No , sir , The M.I. Doesn 't mint stupid troopers . - Well , let 's disregard rank . - Zander , please . Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here . - Don 't do this . - Come on . What 's he gonna do ? I 'm gonna kill you ! Quit it ! He 's not worth it ! Forget it , Rico . Mobile Infantry and Fleet don 't mix . Come on , let 's go . Jarheads ! Mobile Infantry rules ! Oh , God , that hurts ! Well , I got something that might hurt just a little bit more , buddy . Oh , yeah ! We 're gonna fight ! And we 're gonna win ! This is the captain . All personnel prepare for drop . We are at " D " minus three and counting . We are going in with the first wave . Means more Bugs for us to kill . You smash the entire area . Kill anything that has more than two legs . - You get me ? - We get you , sir ! - Plasma , ma 'am , from the planet . - Bug batteries . According to Military Intelligence , it 'll be random and light . - Drop status ? - Drop is 35 % complete , ma 'am , Steady as she goes , Number Two .

Sky Marshall Dienes resigns . His successor , Sky Marshall Tahat Meru ... outlines her new strategy . To fight the Bug ... . we must understand the Bug . We can ill afford another Klendathu . Would you like to know more ? Federal scientists struggle to explain ... the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids . When a colony reaches a certain size ... three hundred generations or something ... it gets smarter . Insects with intelligence ? Have you ever met one ? I can 't believe I am hearing this nonsense ! This is the most ridiculous conversation I have ever had ! Maybe there is some kind of Bug that we haven 't seen yet ... a leadership caste of hive brains ! Brain Bugs ? Frankly , I find the idea ... of a Bug that thinks offensive . Ticonderoga , this is Rodger Young requesting approach vector . Affirmative , Rodger Young . One-zero-zero-niner-five-two . Welcome back . My God ! How could this happen ? We thought we were smarter than the Bugs . It 's strange . There 's almost no wounded at all . Bugs don 't take prisoners . Oh , no ! - There he is , - Come on . Let 's wake him up . - Wake up ! - How you doing , fish boy ? Look ! - You 're dead ! - Killed in action ! Three more days and you 're out . Good as new . - See ya later . - Bye . What did you hear about our new unit ? Roughnecks killed more Bugs than any other outfit on Big " K " . I hear the lieutenant 's a real nut-buster . Who 's top kick ? You want the job , huh ? - I wouldn 't mind . - I would . - Just doing my part . - Orders . Yours ? - Where you been besides Big " K " ? - Outer Rings . Zegema Beach . - I always wanted to go there . - Good luck . It 's not there anymore . So I hear your lieutenant 's a real nut-buster . No one talks about the lieutenant that way . - He saved my life . - Mine too . - Same for me . - Me too . Well , sounds like he 's quite a guy . Who do you think saved your ass ? Stand by ! Attention on deck ! This is for you new people . I only have one rule . Everyone fights . No one quits . You don 't do your job , I 'll shoot you . You get me ? We get you , sir ! - Welcome to the Roughnecks . - Rasczak 's Roughnecks ! At ease ! Listen up ! Got a new sky marsh all and a new battle plan .

That 's an order ! Thank you , Lieutenant ! You kill Bugs good . Thanks . You knew the lieutenant before the war . What was he like ? He was a teacher . Kind of like he knew it all . He always had this little smile . Well , he don 't smile much anymore . Well , I guess your bottle fills up real quick when your kids get smeared . - Come on , Corporal . - I don 't do that anymore . I remember when you used to dance . Come on . Do I have to pull rank ? Excuse me , sir . You once asked me for advice . Want some now ? - Yes , sir . - Lieutenant . HQ is on the com . Never pass up a good thing . Beer ? So , Rico , what are you doing after the dance ? What 's so funny ? You know , just the way things work out . We finally got together , Diz . I love you , Johnny . We 're moving out . There 's been a distress call from planet " P " . So get your shit wired and report in ten minutes . - Yes , sir . - Who 's that with you ?

Come in , please ? - Any contact with General Owen ? - No , sir . - Not even the transponder signal . - It 's these canyons . Go to higher ground , Sergeant . Sugar , your weapon . I 'd expect anyone in this unit to do the same for me . You 're acting sergeant . Move ' em out . You heard the lieutenant ! Saddle up ! Someone really humped the bunk . - Watkins ? - Sir ? Secure this compound . Police these bodies . Yes . Sir . Give me three up on the tower , now ! O. P. There ! O. P. There ! Siren Two , police up these bodies ! It stinks in there . - Rico ? - Yes , sir ? We need retrieval . This place crawls . Get somebody in a communications tent and get me an uplink . - Diz , check it out . - Man group with me . Lieutenant ! Dirty Bugs came in right when they were having chow . This is where they got in . I think you 're gonna wanna see this . - What have you got , Flores ? - God , I hate this pl ace . What 's that look like to you , Rico ? Looks like a Bug was in his brain . They sucked his brains out . Open that . Officer on the deck ! Pick up the general . Is it safe ? We 've got to get out of here ! Sir ! Thank God for you . All of you . You 're all gonna be heroes , every last one of you . - Close that hole . - Yes . Sir . I had to evade capture . The security of the Federation was at stake . I have operational knowledge of what we 're up to out here . - I need that uplink . - Working on it , sir . - Damn it ! - See ? They get in your mind . Look , they did it to Farley . They got into his mind . They make you do things . - They made Farley call headquarters . - The distress call was a trap . They 're just like us . They want to know what makes us tick . They wanna know us so they can kill us . Roughnecks , this is Lead . Prepare for attack . - We 're gonna be attacked . - Where 's the retrieval boat ? Mayday . This is Roughneck Two-Zero to Battle Group . Do you read ? Oh , God ! We 're gonna die ! Don 't you understand ? We 're all gonna die ! - Control yourself , General . - I can 't ! I can 't ! I wish you 'd just shoot me . He 's just a little out of his mind , sir . Bugs ! Bugs ! - Die ! - All right . Warm it all up ! Everything you 've got ! Come on , you apes ! You wanna live forever ? I got Bugs ! Magazine ! Fire at will ! Incoming ! Rico ! Where 's my communications ? - Diz , status on the uplink ? - Give me a minute . We don 't have a minute ! Battle Group , this is Roughneck Two-Zero . - This is Rodger Young . Go ahead . - We are under attack , sir ! - We need retrieval now ! - We have Planet " P " as clear . This place crawls , sir .

Johnny , don 't let me go ! This is Battle Control . Proceed on vector five-niner-two-two-seven . I think you should know ... your friend Rico is back there . Get on the com and tell Fleet to blast that rock . On whose authority , Corporal ? That would be mine , sir . I assumed command of the mission . Rodger Young , we have an official request ... . by the Mobile Infantry to commence bombardment of planet " P. " I thought you were dead . I 'm not , but a lot of my troopers are . Negative on your request . The sky marshall ... has other plans for planet " P. " Welcome back . M. I. does the dying , and Fleet just does the flying . Hold on . Something 's up . Fleet 's mobilized for a big operation . Attention on deck ! Once , somebody asked me ... if I knew the difference between a citizen and a civilian . I can tell you now . A citizen has the courage ... to make the safety of the human race their personal responsibility . Dizzy was my friend . She was a soldier ... but more than that ... she was a citizen of the Federation . Present arms ! Order arms ! Left face ! - Officer on deck . - Carry on . Burial detail , dismissed . - At ease . - How are you , Carl ? Carmen , good . Johnny , I 'm sorry it had to be your unit on " P. " That mission had a very low survival probability . The Bugs I aid a trap for us , didn 't they ? Elegant proof of intelligence , isn 't it ? We thought there might be a Brain Bug on " P. " You knew , and you sent them anyway ? We couldn 't afford to launch an operation if there wasn 't one . You don 't approve . Well , too bad . We 're in this for the species , boys and girls . It 's simple numbers . They have more , and every day ... I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people to their deaths . Didn 't they tell you , Colonel ? That 's what the Mobile Infantry 's good for . I hope you 're ready for more . We 're going back to " P " to capture that Brain . The Roughnecks are always ready , sir . I hear they need a new lieutenant . Want the job ? I 'll take it , until I get killed or you find someone better . Well ? Take care of yourself . I 'll see you again . Officer on deck ! - Who are all these kids ? - We got reinforced . Most of them are fresh out of boot . We 're the old men , Ace . This is for all you new people . I only have one rule . Everyone fights . No one quits . You don 't do your job , I 'll kill you myself . - Do you get me ? - We get you , sir ! - Welcome to the Roughnecks . - Rico 's Roughnecks ! Today we 're gonna pay a visit to Bug City . We 're looking for a Bug no one 's ever seen before . Some kind of smart Bug . And it probably knows we 're coming . Saddle up ! Evasive action . Get us clear for warp , Number Two . Clear in five , four ... Initiating star drive in five ... This is Rodger Young . We 're going down . Get out ! Abandon ship ! Come on ! - Zander ! - Here ! - We 've got to get to the rescue deck ! - Come on ! Captain ! Abandon ship . That is an ... She 's dead , Carmen ! Here ! Follow me ! Ready ? Hit it ! Life pod Bravo - Six-Three-Two , abort . Scouting for a landing zone . Checking terrain . Here ! - Can you handle that ? - Piece of cake . We 've lost the Rodger Young . Fleet Command , we have confirmation . The Rodger Young is down . Rodger Young just burned up . It 's on the rescue net . Any survivors ? Well , they 're getting tarred up there pretty bad . Life pod Bravo - Six-Two-Three , abort ! Is anyone receiving ? Affirmative . This is Roughneck Two-Zero . You 're breaking up . Say again . - Carmen ? - Say again . I 'm losing you . Prepare for landing ! Retro in three , two , one . Fire ! - You okay ? - Uh-huh . Get out . This is Roughneck Two-Zero . Are you receiving ? Over . This is Roughneck Two-Zero . Carmen , are you receiving ? This is Roughneck Two-Zero . Carmen , are you receiving ? Johnny , is that you ? Yeah , it 's me ! What 's your position and situation ? We 're in Bug City , 20 meters underground . Position : south 42. east 118 . Situation is ... I repeat , south 42 , east 118 . Situation is extremely hostile . I need a squad to pull ' em out ! - Direction ? - Three clicks , south by southwest . Look out ! - What do you wanna do ? - You heard the lieutenant ! Rescue party ! - Search squad , come with me ! - Cancel that ! You know as well as I do she 's already dead . Sorry , buddy . Roughnecks , let 's move . All right . Why didn 't they kill us ? They want us alive . We should go this way . " A " company 's that way . Yeah . But Carmen 's down there . Hey , I hate to be rude , buddy , but word has it she 'd dead . - She 's still alive . - How do you know ? - I don 't know how I know , but I know . - Listen . You got command , but going off mission . That 's a serious offense . Yeah . I think they hang you for that . Roughneck Two-Zero , proceed on mission . I need two volunteers . One day , someone like me ... is gonna kill you ... and your whole fucking race . You know what this is ? Sure , you do . You 're some kind of big , fat , smart Bug , aren 't ya ? Come on . This is Roughneck Two-Zero . Brain Bug sighted moving west of grid five . Run ! - Give me the nuke ! - You trying to be a hero ? I 'm trying to kill some Bugs , sir . Get outta here ! Move ! You like that ? Come on ! You want some more ! You like that ? You want a little more ? Come on ! Down ! Come on , Carmen . We did it ! - What 's goin ' on ? - We got it ! Come on ! What 's it thinking , Colonel ? It 's afraid . Well , look who 's here . You made it . Good . It was you , wasn 't it ? You told me how to find Carmen . Well , that 's classified . You know . Whenever the three of us are together ... I feel like things might just work out . I hope you 're right . We 've got one of their Brains now . Pretty soon we 'll know how they think , and then we 'll know how to beat them . One day , it will all be over ... and everyone will forget that this was the moment . This is when it turned . And it wasn 't the mighty Fleet . It wasn 't some fancy new weapon . It was a drill instructor named Zim who captured a Brain . Come on ! He got him ! Yeah ! Zim got the Bug , man ! - Good job , Sergeant . - Thank you , sir . That would be Private , sir . - Carry on , Private . - Yes , sir ! What mysteries will the Brain Bug reveal ? Federal scientists are working ... around the clock to probe its secrets . Once we understand the Bug , we will defeat it . We have the ships . We have the weapons . We need soldiers . Soldiers like Lieutenant Stack Lumbreiser ... Over the target area now , Captain . And Captain Carmen Ibanez . This is the captain speaking . All personnel prepare for drop . Soldiers like Private Ace Levy and Lieutenant John Rico . Come on , you apes ! You wanna live forever ? We need you all . Service guarantees citizenship .

 ยก Ven aqui ! ยก Ven aqui ! ยก Ven ! Aver . Nos debemos irnos y dejarlo en paz . Debemos decirle al anciano . El sabra que hacer . Esto es malo , muy malo . Nos va a traer problemas para todos nosotros . Le tenemos que decir al Doctor Roosevelt . Inmediatamente . Dr. Roosevelt . What is it ? We found something I think you should see . It 's an Amaru . I know . It 's fantastic . It 's nearly intact . We can 't take it . What do you mean ? They 're saying the body of a female shaman is sacred to the tribe . They won 't allow us to disturb her . We 're not disturbing her . We 're saving her . You know the situation here . I thought you could handle these people . Dr. Roosevelt , I think this is dangerous . I don 't think this is right . Have the piece cleared and packed . It 's going with us . Mr. Horning , you still here ? Mr. Horning ? What the hell ? How did you learn about what happened here last night ? Tim Decker , one of our security guards , called me when he first discovered the blood . According to the police , you felt this murder may have been an act of political terrorism . I think Craig Horning was killed because of the project he was working on . Is that the , uh , the survey and excavation of the highland burial grounds of the Secona Indians ? This is from a letter that was sent to the State Department on behalf of the Secona demanding the return of a certain artifact . The Amaru urn . It was among the antiquities we rescued last month . " Rescued " ? When Petro Ecuador announced plans to build a gas pipeline through the burial grounds , Carl Roosevelt and I organized the dig . As I understand it , Roosevelt disappeared under circumstances not dissimilar to the ones here . The Ecuadorean government claimed he was carried off in some kind of wild animal attack . But that 's not what you believe . Not after last night . Have there ever been any death threats ? No . Well , what about the curse ? The Secona believe that great evil would befall anyone that disturbed the remains of an Amaru , a woman shaman , that they would be devoured by the jaguar spirit . A myth that gained some currency among the Secona when Dr. Roosevelt disappeared . I 'm sure . The unfortunate thing is somebody exploiting it to promote fear , to pressure us into returning the bones , which I have absolutely no intention of doing . Can we see it ? Yes , of course . Uh , Mona . Personally , if someone digs me up in a thousand years , I hope there 's a curse on them , too . They should have left it buried . None of this would have happened . You believe the bones are cursed ? Might as well be . Did you know Craig Horning ? Yeah , I 've been helping Craig sort and catalog the Ecuadorean artifacts . I 'm a PhD candidate at B.U. Did he have any warning that this could happen ? Craig ? No . He was so dedicated . He was just doing the work that Dr. Lewton asked him to . He had no political feelings about the piece being brought here ? No , not Craig . Are you aware that a letter of protest was sent to the State Department concerning this urn ? I 'm aware of several letters of protest . This one was written by a man named Alonso Bilac . Dr. Bilac . He was the liaison with the Secona Indians . Is he still with the project ? No . He either resigned or was forced out by Dr. Lewton , depending on who you talk to . Why is that ? Dr. Bilac feels the Secona have the right to determine the fate of their ancestral remains . Do you know where we might find him ? Dr. Bilac ? Yes . We 're with the FBI . We 're investigating the disappearance of an associate of yours ... Craig Horning . Yes . May we ask you some questions ? Come in then . Dr. Bilac , you were part of the expedition that brought back the Amaru urn . Who told you that ? Mona Wustner . I objected from the beginning . But you were Dr. Roosevelt 's liaison in Ecuador . At what point did you part company with him on the taking of artifacts ? When I felt like he had gone too far , against the wishes of the Secona . Did you express that to him ? Yes . He wouldn 't listen . Were you speaking for yourself or for the Indians ? I spent the last six months living with the Secona , learning from them , coming to understand the nature and the depth of their culture . Well , apparently , they 've learned something from you , too . Yes , I 've been teaching them the joys of American bureaucracy . Dr. Lewton believes that the protest over the Amaru urn has something to do with Craig Horning 's disappearance . You say " disappearance " as if you expect to see him alive again . What do you think happened to him ? You don 't want to know what I think . Yes , we would like to know . We 'd be very interested in what you think . I think whatever happened to Craig Horning will continue to happen ... until the bones are returned to their rightful place . Let me ask you , Dr. Bilac , how far would you go to defend the rights of the Seconas ? Farther than writing a letter to the State Department ? If you think I did this , then you 're a fool . Can you account for your whereabouts last night ? I was here . Alone ? Yes . Your investigation is a waste of time . That 's something I can assure you of . It 's nice to meet people who really believe in something , isn 't it ? You mean the kind who would kill for their cause ? You think Bilac 's a suspect ? No , I think he 's the suspect . Based on what ? Based on the arrogance of his politics , on his rift with Dr. Lewton , on his sympathies towards the Indians , and the lack of any other suspect . He did look a little squirrely back there . Maybe because he was up late last night murdering Craig Horning . Let me remind you that we don 't have a body and not much more forensic detail than a lot of spilled blood . Craig Horning 's blood . What do you think he did with him ? I 'm not sure he did anything . So you think Bilac 's innocent ? That the victim wasn 't even murdered at all ? That he was devoured by a mythological jaguar spirit ? Go with it , Scully . Why did you lie to them ? You 're only drawing suspicion to yourself by lying , Lonnie . You should have told them the truth . I 'm worried about you . Let me come over . Why ? Why not ? Dr. Lewton 's here . I got to go . I 'll call you later . Thought you 'd already left . I have , uh ... I really need to keep working right now . I 'd feel better if you weren 't alone here . Oh , the guard knows I 'm here . Was that Dr. Bilac on the phone ? Yes . We have a responsibility , Mona ... to history and posterity . Dr. Roosevelt was only doing what any good conservationist would have done in bringing the Amaru urn back . Otherwise , it would certainly have been destroyed . I know . You know , if we get caught up in the politics , we lose sight of that . Mona , let me give you a little free advice . You have a bright future here . Be careful where you plant your flag . Oh , Sugar . Label that . As what ? Partial rat body part . Excuse me . Can I have a word with you ? We 're done . You were working here last night when Dr. Lewton was killed . He stopped by my office on his way out . Did you notice anything out of the ordinary ? Was he behaving strange or did he seem nervous about anything ? No , not at all . Did he say anything to you about Dr. Bilac ? No , he didn 't . Do you have any idea when the two of them last spoke to each other ? I really don 't know . I 'm going to give you my card . Call me if anything comes to mind . Mulder . They turn up a body ? No . They 've been over the entire museum grounds . Have you found anything at all out here ? If Dr. Lewton was brought through here , it 's going to be hard to determine . It looks like it rained pretty hard last night . Well , they determined that the hood release had been pulled . And they found a small flashlight near the car . Looks to me like he was checking the engine when he was attacked . Maybe somebody didn 't want that car started . - I don 't think so , Mulder . - Why not ? We found evidence of at least two mutilated rat bodies down in the engine compartment . - Rats ? - Apparently , the museum has always had a rat problem . They must have crawled into the engine to keep warm . You know , Mulder , there 's hardly a thing about these deaths that adds up . What 's the estimate on the time of death ? Somewhere between 9 : 30 and midnight , when the guard discovered the blood . That 's about the same time as Craig Horning . What 's the connection ? I don 't know . I think Mona Wustner might know something . Why ? Well , she seemed to get nervous when I asked her about Bilac . Maybe she 's trying to protect him . Oh , think it 's starting to rain again . I don 't think so , Mulder . What the hell is that ? Lonnie ? Lonnie ? Don 't . Lonnie ? I came to tell you ... Dr. Lewton is dead . Did you hear what I said ? Say something , Lonnie , please . You 're scaring me . I told you not to come here ! Why not ? What 's happened to you ? Ever since you came back , you 're acting like some stranger . Like someone else . The blood has to stop . You know something , don 't you ? You wouldn 't understand . Then help me to understand ! Y-You can tell me . You know that , don 't you ? What is that ? Vine of the soul . Yaje ? You 're drinking yaje ? ! You 're sick , Lonnie . You need help . Don 't you see what 's happening here ? Can 't you see what you 're doing to yourself ? Go . Let me help you . I said , get out ! Well , it 's human . Small intestine . There 's about four feet of jejunum and another foot of ileum . Do we know for sure it 's Lewton ? Yeah , by what he had for lunch : corn chowder . And it looks like he 'd been snacking on sunflower seeds all afternoon . A man of taste . What I can 't determine is exactly how the body was eviscerated . There are no knife marks on the epithelium . I imagine that they could have been torn or pulled from the body cavity . Torn or pulled ? But I can 't determine that either , because there was considerable postmortem predation . By what ? Well , by the size of the bite marks , a small animal , most probably a rat . More rats . Yep . Scully . Slow down , Mona . I was with Dr. Bilac . He frightened me . I ... I thought he was going to hurt me . What happened , Mona ? He 's sick . He doesn 't know what he 's doing . Where is he now ? At his house . I ... I left him there , and I came back to the museum , but ... I feel like someone 's here . Like someone 's watching me . I want you to stay exactly where you are . I 'm going to send Agent Mulder over to get you right away , okay ? He 's on his way . What is it , Sugar ? Dr. Bilac ? Oh ! What are you doing here ? Looking for Mona Wustner . I got a panicked call from her . From Mona ? Yeah . Where is she ? I 'll show you . Mulder . Mulder , it 's me . Did you find Mona ? No , but her car is parked outside . She 's not here . Did you find Bilac ? No . He 's not here , either , but I found some of his journals . Listen to this . " I 've seen the Amaru coming out of the jungle " with the eyes of a scorpion , the claws of a jaguar . " She leaps down from the trees . " She tears at my flesh , then holds my head in her hands , and eats out my eyes . " Is there a date of entry on that ? These are all recent . Read me that part about the jaguar coming down from the trees again . Why ? Maybe that 's how the intestines got up there . Mulder , I think Bilac 's been tripping . I found something strange in a ceremonial bowl , and-and from his writings , it says that it 's ... it 's a hallucinogen called " yaje . " " The vine of the soul . " What the hell is that supposed to mean ? I think he 's praying to the Amaru through some kind of a ceremony . What does he want from her ? It looks like he 's invoking the curse , Mulder . Scully , I 'm going to have to call you back . Did you find Mona ? I hope not . What are you doing here ? I said , what are you doing here ? She 's dead . Where is she ? I don 't know . You told Agent Mulder that she was dead . You must know where she is . I didn 't kill her . Then why do you have blood on your clothes ? I told you . I came here because the Amaru would not be appeased . I was afraid for Mona . I tried to keep her away from all this . She was an innocent . She said she was scared . She said that you became violent . She wouldn 't listen . Maybe you were too high to know the difference . There is no curse , is there , Dr. Bilac ? You are the curse . No . This is more powerful than any man . This is a spirit you 're dealing with ... the spirit of the Amaru . This is not something you can put in handcuffs . I 'm going to ask you one more time , Dr. Bilac . Where is Mona 's body ? I don 't know . This man stays in that room until there 's a full search of the museum , okay ? Yes , ma 'am . Hey , Scully ! Come here for a second . Just dawned on me . Why do you think there 's so much water in here ? I just assumed that one of toilets had overflowed . There 's water on every seat . It 's more like every toilet overflowed . Now , why would that happen ? I guess there 's only one way to find out . I hate this . Rats . In every toilet . How did they get in there ? Agent Mulder . Yeah . The police found something outside . Mona Wustner ? No . Sugar ... her dog . He 's dead . Finally , a body . What did you find ? I have to run a full toxicological to be sure , but it looks like warfarin poisoning . Warfarin ? Rat poison . Someone fed this dog rat poison ? No . When I dissected the dog 's stomach , I found an undigested fragment of intestine which appears to be feline . The dog ate a cat . I also found what appears to be bits of rat fur . I think the rat ate the poison . Cat ate a rat . And the dog ate the cat . More rats , Scully . Yeah ? Don 't you think that 's significant ? Significant of what ? There were rats in Dr. Lewton 's car engine . There were rats in the bathroom where it looks like Mona Wustner may have been killed , and now here . It 's an old building , Mulder . They have a rat problem ; a lot of old buildings have rats . No , I think it 's more than that . What is it that the Secona believe ? That the jaguar spirit will devour anybody that desecrates the burial place of a holy woman . Essentially , they 're talking about transmigration of the soul into animal form achieved through a ceremony where they drink the , uh ... - Yaje . - Yeah . To summon the spirits . So what are we talking here , Mulder ? A possessed rat ? The return of Ben ? No , no , I think those rats were killed trying to escape from something . Something that sent them diving into the toilet ? No , the lids were down ; they weren 't trying to get into the toilets , they were trying to get out . They were coming from within the sewer lines , trying to get away from something . Have you been drinking yaje , Mulder ? Go with it , Scully . Agent Scully ? Bilac 's gone . What ? How 's that possible ? I don 't know . I went to check on him , and he just ... wasn 't there . Did you step away from this door at any time ? No . And no one entered this room ? Absolutely not . What about a rat ? Sir ? You ever see any rats in this room ? All the time . Why ? How do you think they get in here ? Through the old heating system . There are vents all over the place . Are there any other doors or windows in this room ? I checked ; there 's only one way out . You didn 't hear anything ? Nothing . I heard nothing . I want you to search the entire building , beginning with every room on this floor . Yes , ma 'am . Hey , Scully , take a look at this . What does that lead to ? The old steam tunnels . How do you get down there ? They 're pretty much sealed up . Haven 't been used for 50 years . You think Bilac crawled down there ? Unless he was dragged . The system looks like it branches off into three directions . There must be miles of tunneling down there . And only one way in . And one way out . Ladies first ? Which way ? To the left , it looks like . Follow that rat . We should be directly under the museum here . Scully ? Scully ! What is it ? Oh , my God . It 's Dr. Lewton . Looks like his eyes were eaten right out of their sockets . We still don 't know by what . What is it ? I think it 's a cat . You think that cat killed those people ? No . These cats . Which way is out ? Come on , Scully . No , Mulder , this way . There 's a room here with a vent . There . It 's Bilac . Can you reach up in there ? Yeah . Let 's pull him down . You 've been down there too long . It 's all right . Come on up . Okay . I will call you back later . Well , the search team 's on their way back up . They 've recovered all the bodies , including Mona 's and Bilac 's . What about the cats ? Animal control is still looking . So far , they haven 't found any sign of them . Well , we both saw them down there , Scully . We know they 're down there . Well , no one 's denying that , Mulder . It 's just that there are miles of tunnels down there , and they 're saying it 's going to take weeks to search them all . Well , by then , it won 't even matter . What are you talking about ? I just got off the phone with the Assistant Secretary of State 's office . They 've called in the Ecuadorean ambassador . What for ? Five people had to die , but they 're finally taking it seriously . The curse ? No . Bilac 's letter of protest . The State Department has asked the museum remain closed until they can act officially on it . Are they going to send back the bones ? The urn will be back in Ecuador by the end of the week . The Suffolk County coroner ruled the deaths at the museum were the result of animal attacks . What motivated these attacks and why no more have occurred since has not been explained . To the museum , the Amaru urn was an artifact from a dying culture ... its curse merely a primitive superstition . Dr. Bilac learned there is a world beyond our own , unseen but powerful , and as real as the urn itself . The icons from that world represent forces that cannot be tamed or collected in a museum . The true curse that struck the museum was the failure to understand that there are powers that should not be disturbed ... that some things are better left buried . I made this !

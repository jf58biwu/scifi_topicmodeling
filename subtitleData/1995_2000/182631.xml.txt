Air support coming in . They 're gonna hit the building . Over . - Roger . - You 've got to call off that air strike . We 're gonna die in here , corporal . Hobbes ! [ GUNS FIRING ] Waters ! Where are you ? WATERS : Hobbes . [ WATERS GROANING ] Kids robbed me , Hobbes . Can you believe that ? Last time I do them a favor . HOBBES : Take it easy , Waters . They 're gonna bomb the building . I gotta get you out . Save yourself , buddy . Go on . HOBBES : I never believed in fate or destiny or that stuff about your path already being chosen . Who could believe it when a choice made in the space of a heartbeat can change your life ? But here I am , dearest darling , wondering what force put me here brought me to this moment , a fate I never wished for but have now certainly attained . How could I know this moment would change our lives forever ? Sophie ? Hey , hon . SOPHIE : In the bedroom . Don 't come in . Why ? SOPHIE : Because I said so , Tom . Now , don 't . There 's something in the mail from the county clerk 's office , Sophie . Maybe they decided not to give us our marriage license . SOPHIE : Then I won 't need the dress . Well ? What do you think ? Tom ? What are you doing , Sophie ? - It 's my wedding dress , stupid . - I know , I 'm just ... I 'm not supposed to see it until the wedding day . Thomas F. Hobbes , I swear , sometimes ... It 's tradition , Sophie , you know ? Well , tradition and all maybe you shouldn 't see this , either . Well , that 's one of those traditions I can overlook . You want to overlook it right now ? Yeah . Right now . HOBBES : I 'm thinking California . California ? Is that what you want ? I want to get as far away from here as possible . Start a life . Get a little house . Another dog . No kids ? Hm ? Hm ? Well first things first . I love you , Tom Hobbes but first thing , we better both get some sleep . Sun 's coming up . [ MOANS ] [ KNOCKING ] Now , who could that be at this hour ? Lieutenant Hobbes . Wake you , sir ? - No , I was ... - Your C.O. Wants to see you . Asks that you pack an overnight bag . - For what ? - Didn 't say . Asked us to wait . SOPHIE : Tom ? What do they want ? Lieutenant Hobbes , reporting as ordered , colonel . Lieutenant Hobbes . You look tense , son . At ease . Your C.O. Tells me we 're losing you from the Army next month . HOBBES : Yes , sir . - Too bad . I hear you were once a true believer , a man of caliber and resource . Decorated for an act of extraordinary bravery overseas . That resourcefulness saved your friend 's life . You want to know why you 're here . That 's damn good food , Hobbes . Eat . You know a classified project known as Harsh Realm , lieutenant ? - Harsh Realm ? - It 's a simulated war game . A virtual-reality game used to teach situational war strategy . Pentagon developed it . Kept it under wraps . Cold War came to an end . You know the rest . Pardon me for asking , sir , but what does that have to do with me ? You 're here to play the game . We 've got it online , looking for a crackerjack soldier who can beat our high scorer , Sergeant Major Omar Santiago . You know Santiago , lieutenant ? Most decorated combat veteran to serve in Southeast Asia . Retired . But not before beating the reigning lord of the Realm a title he 's defended from all players since . - What 's the objective ? - Take out Santiago . Ma 'am ? Remove his virtual character . Eliminate him from Harsh Realm . It 's just a game , lieutenant . Make high score . Leave the military a winner . We pull a few strings for you and your new wife in California . Video will explain how the game is played . Everything you need to know about Harsh Realm . How long is the game gonna take ? All on the video , lieutenant . Shouldn 't be any questions . I do have one question . How 'd you know I was thinking about moving to California ? Who wouldn 't move there who 's lived here ? [ FEEDBACK WHINING ] [ MUSIC PLAYS ] WOMAN : Technology and the threat of nuclear annihilation in the last half of the 20th century have changed the world forever . They 've changed war and its consequences as they have forever changed the battlefield and the warriors who must still fight on them . It 's been estimated that a nuclear device the size of a small suitcase smuggled in and detonated in New York City would kill several million people instantly and many times that amount with radioactive fallout . This scenario compelled the DOD to create the project code-named Harsh Realm . Using the 1990 census , satellite cartography and other classified data the creators of Harsh Realm have simulated a virtual reality where landscapes and people are identical to our world down to every man , woman and child . By putting players in this simulated crisis scenario , we can protect ... Hello ? [ GUNS FIRING ] Take it ! PINOCCHIO : Boom ! You 're dead . Let 's have the watch . Just as happy to take it off a dead man . Let 's go . Pockets . Empty them . Shirt pockets , dick . It 's my wedding ring . - From my girl . - Well , I 'm touched . Just the ring . That 's all I want . I could have killed you . Should have . [ HELICOPTER APPROACHING ] - And now we 're both going to die ! - Hey ! Hey ! [ GUNS FIRING ] Come on . Okay . Waters ! Hey , Waters ! It 's me , Tom ! Tom Hobbes ! [ GUN FIRES ] [ MEN YELLING IN DISTANCE ] Who are you ? What 's going on ? Are you military ? Is this a game ? Am I in Harsh Realm ? HOBBES : My dearest Sophie . I know it can 't be , but it all seems so real . Is this what the world will become ? Is this nightmare I 'm in only a mistake away ? HOBBES : Sophie ! Sophie ? What the hell is this place ? Sophie . [ DOG WHIMPERING ] Dexter ? How can this be ? You 're here . HOBBES : What are we that we would need to create such a place as this ? How do I get out , Sophie ? How do I get back to you ? All I can think is I must finish the game . I must find Santiago . [ LOUD MUSIC PLAYING ] Carat at least . Sparkles like a virgin 's teardrop . Where 'd you get it ? He stole it from me , and I 'd like it back , please . I swear I just heard somebody cock a gun in your bar , ' keep . But one rule in this cesspool , and you done broke it , dick . I just want what 's mine . Lose the gun , it 's a conversation . Don 't , and they kill you . I get to eat your dog . Ruined my dinner plans . I 'm not leaving without that ring , I 'm telling you now . Fine , but you best be talking to the man who owns it . Welcome to Harsh Realm . Run along , GI . Maybe you 'll get lucky and find Santiago . How did you know I was looking ? GI asks how I knew he was looking for Santiago ! [ MEN LAUGHING ] Everybody here is looking for Santiago , one time or another . - You can 't find him ? - No , I know where he is . Take me to him . I 'll give you my dog . PINOCCHIO : Hey . For the dog . HOBBES : So this is Santiago 's fence . PINOCCHIO : His fence . His military . His gas . His food . His world . And it just keeps getting bigger . How do I get over it ? Right through here . Glitch in the software . Not there , A-hole ! You gotta know where the glitches are , genius . Uh , we had a deal . The dog . Welcome to Harsh Realm . PINOCCHIO : I will shoot you in the back . [ GUN CLICKS ] You 're gonna die anyway . At least I know where you 'll be . Hey , I got travel plans ! Hey ! Now , what are you doing out here ? Who do you belong to , boy ? Where 's your C.O. ? MAN : Evening , Major Waters . Sergeant Waters , ten-hut . Hobbes , is that you ? Oh , Lord , they sent you too . Thought you 'd be happy to see me , buddy . Stupid . Hobbes , you 've got to get out of here . - Where 's Santiago ? - Oh , mother of Mary , you don 't get it . The game , " Get in , get out , get Santiago " it 's all a freaking lie , Hobbes . It 's no game . No getting out , no going home . I got the same mission . - What are you doing here ? - What do you think ? I 'm trying to save my ass so I don 't have to live like some dog in the bush . - Army 's got a name for that . - There 's no other way . Go , Hobbes . Stay , you 're a dead man . - Why am I a dead man ? - Because my orders are to kill you . And I don 't follow my orders , I 'm a dead man . You get it , Hobbes ? Yeah , I think I do . You saved my life , now I 'm saving yours . Go . Leave before my wife gets home . I 'll come find you . I 'll help you , I will . But not now . Not now . [ DOOR OPENS ] Sophie . Mel , who is this ? Listen to me , Hobbes . It 's not her . She 's V.C. - You married her ? - She 's not real , she 's a virtual character . - It doesn 't matter . - The hell it doesn 't ! Who are you ? I 'm Tom Hobbes your fianc√© . HOBBES : I don 't like doing this , Sophie , but I don 't see another way . SOPHIE : Just don 't hurt me . - Where are you taking me ? - I don 't know . I 'm not leaving you here with Waters . What do you have against my husband ? He 's not your husband . Where did you get that ? Your middle name is Ann . You 've got two sisters and a brother , Sam . In the real world , they were gonna be in our wedding . I think you need help . [ SIRENS APPROACHING ] SOPHIE : Would you just let me go ? HOBBES : It 's not much further . You 've got to trust me . Hold it . No . Let me go ! You can 't take me over there ! You don 't understand ! - You 're gonna get us both killed ! HOBBES : I 'm not . - I 'm trying to save you . - Let her go . SOPHIE : You 're insane ! - Let her go ! - You stay out of this . - She can 't come past this fence . - She 's coming with me ! - She can 't come past this fence ! Stupid bastard . Give me the keys . [ ALARM SOUNDS ] Give me the keys ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Keys ! [ THUNDER CRASHING ] She set it off coming through the fence . It 's an implanted tracking device . Just get it out of her . - Who is she ? - What difference does it make to you ? No difference to me , hell . She 's a virtual character , isn 't she ? She means nothing to you , so just get it out of her . [ DOG GROWLS AND BARKS ] I 'm gonna eat that dog yet . Have a seat . We gotta shake a leg . They 're tracking us right now . Pinocchio . Your name is Pinocchio ? Forget that name . Wipe it from memory . There are people who think I 'm dead . I 'd like to keep it that way , you understand ? We 're not like her , like the V.C. We have consciousness of who we are . We know this isn 't real . - Then why does it matter ? - It 's all that matters because Harsh Realm is all that matters . Why , if it isn 't real ? You 're stuck here , don 't you get it ? There 's no going back , no going home . If they kill you here , it 's not some character they zap , it 's you . Your brain , your consciousness your head , where they have you lying on some slab back in the real world . - There 's got to be a way out . - Not for you , not for me . Only Santiago . Santiago controls the game , and he who controls the game controls everything . Why don 't they just take Santiago out in the real world ? They don 't know where he is , where he comes in and out . He 's hijacked the whole damn program . HOBBES : There 's only one thing to do . There 's only one choice . - Kill Santiago . - Hmph ! He 's gonna get you both killed . What about her ? If she dies here ? Never see her again in Harsh Realm . [ GROANS ] [ SHIP HORN BLOWING ] HOBBES : Hey . - Hey , where are you going ? - Far away from you and Santiago . I 'm late , but I 'm here . - We good ? - He 'll take one more . Wait , one more where ? South America . So long and adios , GI . It was nice knowing you . - She 's getting on this boat . PINOCCHIO : No more room . She 's going on this boat . You let her take your place . Now you 're starting to piss me off . I paid with her ring . You let her on . It 's the right thing to do . The right thing to do ? Adios to you all , man . Get on the boat . Go . Please , Sophie . Trust your heart , what it feels . Somewhere inside , you gotta know who your heart was meant for . Go now . I promise I 'll find you . Happy ? [ GUNS FIRING ] On your feet , Hobbes . Let 's go . HOBBES : General Santiago ? Mr. Hobbes , welcome to the Realm . - I hear that you intend to kill me . - I had orders to win the game . Well , you 've lost the game , sir . To make certain your loss and my victory I should kill you . Would that not be advisable ? Kill your enemy dead , lest he rise up strong with spite ? Spite , Mr. Hobbes , is not what drives me , but my enemy the men who sent you here to destroy all this . All this ? I provide for my people a beautiful way of life void of strife . Could you find such a true thing in the real world ? What about outside the fence ? Those people are just on the wrong side . As you were . You must be able to see that now . You 've been sent on a mission from which you can 't return . [ DOOR OPENS ] MAN : Stay in line . Keep moving . A man can have it all here . Who helped Hobbes ? His name . I don 't know him or his name . SANTIAGO : That 's enough . We don 't want Mr. Hobbes to think that she 's been mistreated . She knows the man 's name and she 's going to get it for us by whatever means necessary . I never believed the stories , but I believe them now . About another world and a man who 's coming to save us . I am your savior ! I am that man . Get someone in here to see to her . [ DOOR CLOSES ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ] I knew it the moment I saw him . I should be in South America . [ BARKS ] What are you looking at ? [ WHINES ] Hey . Let 's go . Move it out . - What are you doing here ? - Saving my ass . Why ? Because he 'll torture you just to get my name . Look , I know what he 's capable of . I was sent here just like you . Now , come on . Not without Sophie . She 's here . She knows your name too . Sophie ! I want you to come with me . Let 's go , Hobbes . It 's you , isn 't it ? Let 's go ! WATERS : Stop right there ! Weapon on the floor . Well , well my Pinocchio live and well . [ GUN FIRING ] Waters ! It was Mike Pinocchio . He was here . For who ? Hobbes ? My wife . I killed her . You 've made a terrible mistake . Hobbes will never stop now . HOBBES : Whose destiny is this ? It can 't be mine . What is this trial I 'm being put through ? Is this a test of my love for you ? These people are afraid . They are the hunted , and I count myself as one of them now though they look at me strange , as if I knew a secret or something . I know only this : I love you , dearest one , and will fight my war here . Know my heart , and please don 't worry . I 'll be home . I 'll be home .

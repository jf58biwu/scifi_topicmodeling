Is currently being held in five-Point restraints and jabbering like a monkey , And the F.B.I. ' s not talkin ' either . So what I 'm lookin ' at here is a warehouse break - In with nothing stolen , A shootout but no guns , lots of blood but no bodies ... And an F.B.I. Agent who likes to take off all his clothes and talk about space aliens . Fill me in . From the top . Start with your name and birth date . John Fitzgerald Byers , 11 / 22 in ' 63 . - Seriously . - I was named after JFK . Before the assassination , my parents were gonna call me Bertram . Lucky you . Occupation ? I work for the government , for the moment . - What do you do for the government , for the moment ? - I 'm a public affairs officer ... For the federal communications commission . It was in that capacity that I was attending ... The computer and electronics show at the Baltimore convention center . [ Byers ] it was where this whole thing started , just this morning . We at the F.C.C. Enjoy forging ... Positive ties with the American public . It 's our way of saying , " communication is just another word for sharing . " Hi , guys . You like a button ? Up yours , narc . [ Byers narrating ] of course , some people don 't see it like that . At any rate , that was where I first saw her . Would you like a but-Button ? Uh- - [ Byers narrating ] I 'm still not sure why I did what I did next . It was so unlike me . There was just something about her . Ken , I 'm gonna take a short break , okay ? Whatever . [ Beeping , chirping ] [ Man ] hello , pretty lady . Picture this . Crystal-Clear television . Thirty-Three channels ' worth , with no monthly cable bill . Excuse me ? Now , I know what you 're thinkin ' . " Melvin , are you outta your mind ? No cable bill ? " But that 's exactly what I 'm saying , and I 'm talkin ' premium channels here too . You got your HBO , you got your cinemax , you got your showtime , All courtesy of this modestly priced marvel , designed and built ... By the Frohike electronics corporation . [ Man ] there 's a name that inspires consumer confidence . Shut up , punk . Where were we ? If you wanna watch Matlock with Andy Griffith all blue and squiggly , buy from this guy . If you want quality bootleg cable , you talk to me . If you want a converter that 'll short out and burn your house down , Definitely talk to this guy . That was a one-Time fluke . I heat-Sink every breadboard . Yeah , what about co-Ax loss ? Do you use the rg - 6u or the 52-Ohm rg-8 ? [ Blond man ] trick question . It 's a 99-13 . Big man . [ Fake cough ] narc ! Oh ! Ah- - Oh , god . Sorry . I 'm sorry . She 's very cute . Yes , she is . Thank you . Wait . Um , uh- - You just look like you could use some help . So my daughter turned three years old last week . Last Tuesday was her birthday . I hope he remembered that . Her- - Her father took her from you ? My former boyfriend . He kidnapped her . It 's a long story . Basically , I got involved with a man who turned out to be a complete psychotic . Yeah ? We were only together a few months . I was attracted to him because he was dark and mysterious , And then he just kept getting darker and more mysterious . I got pregnant , and he left . [ Sniffles ] and then he suddenly came back ... And took her about six months ago . That 's terrible . Did you call the police ? Of course . [ Sniffles ] The police , then private investigators . They were surprisingly unhelpful . That 's unbelievable . Yeah . Well- - [ Sniffles ] at least I managed to get a couple of leads . I was told he 's in the Baltimore area . So here I am . Well , that 's a start . Yeah . Except he now knows that I 'm looking for him ... And the closer I get , the more dangerous he becomes . Are you ... worried he might harm your daughter ? Let 's just say I wanna find her , not him . [ Sniffles ] This is the only other lead I 've got . That 's why I 'm here today . This has something to do with computers . Doesn 't it ? With the internet ? Actually , the Arpanet . It 's a government network created by the defense advanced research projects agency . You can access it through the internet , though . Somehow this means something to my ex - Boyfriend . I was hoping it might be a means of finding my daughter . If you want , I can go on-Line , try and find out for you . Would you ? Oh , that w- - I would really , really appreciate that . Uh , by the way , my name 's john . Holly . It 's nice to meet you . Holly . Just like the sugar . [ Chuckles ] Yeah . Just like the sugar . Funny . [ Beeping , chirping ] Ken , could you maybe go take a short break ? Whatever . Okay . [ Sighs ] let 's see here . So your ex-Boyfriend is into computers ? I don 't really know . I know very little about him , - Except that he 's psychotic . - [ Computer beeps ] [ Keys clicking ] [ beeps ] Somehow this kicked us into the defense data network . I 'm sorry . I think this is the end of the line . Isn 't there something you could- - I mean , how do you say it- - Hack into ? " Hack into " ? No ! Um- - I mean , technically , yes , I probably could , But- - But this belongs to the department of defense . This is a secured site . I mean , I work for the F.C.C. This is the kind of thing we 're trying to stop . Thank you , john . I appreciate your time . Wait . You didn 't see this . [ Keys clicking ] [ Computer beeps ] [ Holly ] what did you do ? It 's a government system . I know a couple of log-In / out tricks with the VMS version five . Never mind . Can you look up Susanne Modeski ? That 's my daughter . I 'll try . There 's just no way of telling . - [ Beeps ] - Whew . [ Holly ] what is that ? It 's an encrypted file . Why would your three-Year-Old have an encrypted file ... In a secret defense department database ? Can you decode it ? I 'd need some help . Can you print it out for me ? My god ! Hide . What ? My ex-Boyfriend is out there . The psychotic ? He must have tracked me here . H-He 's looking for me . Damn it ! There he is . You look like a gentleman who 'd appreciate 33 channels of crystal-Clear television . No , thanks , handsome . Ah , a man of distinction . Punk ass . [ Byers ] it was at this point we enlisted the help of one Melvin Frohike ... Computer hacker . Oh , hello , pretty lady . Oh , yeah . What 's with the narc ? We proceeded to tell him the entire story . I hoped he could assist me in deciphering the encrypted file . [ Byers narrating ] it was at this point , however , that Mr. Frohike raised ... An interesting question . I don 't understand . Why don 't you just kick this guy 's ass ? What ? No . I just want these pages decoded . Can you do that ? Sure , baby . My kung fu is the best , but it could take hours . I say , cut to the chase . If pretty boy can tell us where your daughter is , we just beat it out of him . Bad idea . He 's very dangerous . Lady , I 'm dangerous . All right . So we 'll just follow him . For all we know , he 's got the girl here somewhere . Holly , it makes sense . No . Just stay away from him . We 'll stay back a ways . Just wait for us here . Come on , F.C.C. But- - Uh- - Uh- - [ Frohike ] what 's he doin ' ? [ Byers ] talking to somebody . This dude doesn 't look so tough . Act casual . [ Male voice over loudspeaker ] they 're here . Alien invaders are among us . Detect their presence with high-Tech , modern electronics . [ Beeping ] oh ! Sorry . They 're here . Alien invaders ... [ Byers ] he 's moving . Are among us . Detect their presence with high-Tech , modern electronics . What 's up , fellas ? You looking for somebody ? Just , um , the bathroom . I don 't think it 's down here . Hey , you with the F.C.C. ? What 's it to you ? I think we share the same credit union . Special agent Fox Mulder . I 'm with the federal bureau of investigation . I was hoping maybe you could help me . I 'm looking for a girl . I was wondering if you 'd seen her . This is her here . You seen her ? Sorry . Hmm ? What did she do ? What 's it to you ? Thanks , guys . All right ? [ Phone ringing ] Yeah , Mulder . Oh , hey , Reggie . What 's up ? What was that all about ? Her ex-Boyfriend is with the F.B.I. ? Where 'd she go ? [ Man # 1 ] okay , stand back , folks ! [ Man # 2 ] hey , guys , just wait a minute . Excuse us here . Hey , come on ! [ Man # 1 ] let us through . - Ken ? - All I did was play dig dug . I didn 't hack into anybody 's computer . [ M.P. ] Excuse us , please . [ Ken ] seriously , guys , I 've got , like , a circulatory problem . I have a tendency to fall down a lot . Wait . It was me . What are you doing ? I hacked into their computer . So you 're gonna turn yourself in ? Are you crazy ? A hacker never turns himself in . I am not a hacker . Listen . We got F.B.I. Agents running around , military police . Whatever the hell is going on around here , it 's big , And your lady friend is somehow at the center of it all . She needs my help . How can we learn what 's going on ? The F.B.I. Are looking for her . Hack into the F.B.I. Mainframe . I know just the guy who can do it . You 're talking about a premeditated crime ... Against the united states government . Hey . Your second one today . Welcome to the dark side . [ Man ] okay , ladies , who 's down for 50 ? Fifty bucks . Anyone ? Fifty bucks . Oh , man . My diaper-Wearing granny would bet 50 . Come on . [ Scoffs ] there 's no game here . All right . Fifty . Elron the druid bets 50 . Cash only , Elron . I don 't take no personal checks from the bank of middle earth . Come on , natural 20 . Daddy needs a new sword of wounding . [ Creaking ] What 's the big idea bringing ' the narc in here ? Me and the narc have a proposition for you . What proposition ? The coolest hack in the world . Lord Manhammer ? Say it . Say it . Your kung fu is the best . [ Chuckling ] Here . Make yourself useful . - What does this do ? - Besides overheat and burn the hotel down ? It 's a loop-Line shunt . Anyone who tries to trace us will get bounced around ... By c and p 's call-Forwarding software . My personal invention . Oh , god . I 'm gonna get fired . I 'm gonna go to jail . I deserve to go to jail . Shut up already . What do you need me to do ? Just watch and learn . Bingo . Government hack is a snap . Last week I got into the Maryland D.M.V. Changed my endorsement so I could handicap park . I got tinnitus . [ Blond man ] what now ? Look up the F.B.I. Agent . What 'd he say his name was ? Mulder . [ Beeps ] is that your boy ? [ Frohike ] " Fox William Mulder , born 10 / 13 / 61 . " Degree in psychology from oxford university , Top of his class at Quantico . " Commendations out the Ying-Yang . " Currently attached to the violent crimes unit . Single . " There 's nothing in here about him being a psycho or having a daughter . Try , under active cases , holly Modeski . [ Computer beeps ] nada . No case file . Try the daughter . Susanne Modeski . She 's Susanne Modeski ? " Employee at the army advanced weapon facility at Whitestone , New Mexico . " - Whitecorps . - Oh , man . Look at this . Says here she blew up one of their labs , killed four people , Including the M.P. Who tried to stop her at the gate . " Subject Modeski is considered unstable and delusional . " Intellectually brilliant , yet prone to confabulation ... And fits of violent behavior . " " Psychotic and profoundly paranoid . " [ Frohike ] " armed and extremely dangerous . Do not approach . Call immediately for backup . " [ Clattering ] [ Frohike ] oh , no ! Oh . You 've been reading about me . [ Sighs ] My name is Susanne Modeski , not holly . I 'm- - I was an organic chemist ... For the advanced weapons facility , But I never blew up any lab , and I certainly never killed anybody . All I did was try to quit . I don 't have a job you just quit . What about your daughter ? I don 't have one . I 'm sorry . - The photo ? - Came with the wallet . You wouldn 't have believed the truth , obviously , And I desperately needed your help . For what , exactly ? To get this . I still need it deciphered . This has in it everything I need ... To expose the united states government 's plot against its own people ! One I unwittingly ... Helped to forward by developing the ergotamine-Histamine gas . - Ergotamine-Hista- - - E-H , for short . It 's an aerosolized gas which in small doses ... Causes anxiety and paranoia in its subject . Paranoia ? Gotcha . Secret forces within the government plan to test this gas ... On the American people right here in Baltimore ! I am not making this up . Don 't you get it ? Nobody is safe . Look what they did to JFK . What did they do to JFK ? Dallas ? 1963 ? Hello ! They want to control every aspect of our lives , from the cradle to the grave . They practically do already . [ Panting ] Hotel bible . Who do you think put this here ? The government ? One in every hotel room in America . It 's the perfect vessel for electronic surveillance . No one ever questions its presence . Now , I 'm sorry . You 're telling me that the U.S. Government- - The same government that gave us Amtrak- - Not to mention the Susan B. Anthony dollar . Is behind some of the darkest , most far-Reaching conspiracies on the planet ? That 's just crazy ! I mean , like , this guy works for the government . I 'll prove it to you . Just help me decipher this . What do you say , guys ? [ Byers narrating ] of course , at that point , We didn 't feel like we had much choice . Get it off me ! Langly , what 's taking so long ? Should be up any second . Oh , yeah . Here we go . [ Frohike ] far out . [ Frohike ] thank god for supercomputers . " The surprise defection of dr . Susanne Modeski ... " Is a blow to the program , but not a fatal one . " The timetable remains unchanged . " The first E.B.O. Will occur ... In the Baltimore-Washington corridor within one week 's time . " - What 's an E.B.O. ? - Engineered biological operation . Toxic organic agents used on humans . " Security risks are being attenuated . " Dr. Modeski 's team has been processed ... And plausible denial constructed . " Which is another way of saying ... That they 've murdered my research associates and placed the blame on me . [ Susanne ] now do you understand ? Wait . Here it is . [ Susanne ] " e - H product is presently warehoused ... " At 204 fells point road . Lot number a-9000 , awaiting E.B.O. " - This is it . - " Subject Modeski currently monitored around the clock . Covert electronics installed per dr . Michael Kilbourne , 11 / 6 / 88 . " Who 's dr . Michael Kilbourne ? My dentist . Excuse me . What do you think ? That thing about her dentist . [ Byers ] dr . Modeski ? Get in here ! My god ! What did you do ? [ Muffled ] look at it . Look at it ! Am I seeing what I think I 'm seeing ? What 's the address of that warehouse ? Where 's the tooth ? We flushed it . We were afraid it would give away our location . So , we broke into the warehouse . [ Langly ] here it is ! A-9000 , right ? Asthma medicine ? This is how they plan on distributing the gas . In asthma inhalers . This is their random test . Now we 've got proof . [ Mulder ] stay where you are ! I 'm a federal agent ! Susanne Modeski , you are under arrest ... For the murders of four people at Whitestone army base . She didn 't do it . She 's innocent . Yeah . You three are under arrest also . Ma 'am , stay where you are . Just listen . There 's more going on here than meets the eye . You three , get on the ground now ! Ma 'am , stop moving . I 'm not gonna ask you again . [ Footsteps approaching ] Dr. Modeski , please come with us . Federal agent . Identify yourself . - Ma 'am , come with us . - Step forward and identify yourselves now ! [ Gasping ] [ Groaning ] [ Frohike ] oh , man . [ Mulder gasps ] Susanne ! Sanitize it . Keep it coming . That 's it . Come on . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - Ahh ! [ Groaning ] - [ Men shouting , audio distorted ] - They 're here . [ Groaning ] I 'm alive . [ Gagging ] I 'm alive . [ Muffled ] I 'm alive ! Who are you people ? [ Engine rumbling ] [ Frohike ] whoa ! What authority do you have to do this ? [ Langly ] shut up , Byers . Bag him ? No one touches this man . Excuse me . [ Langly ] Byers . Sir . Why are you doing this ? You people framed Susanne Modeski , You planned to test that chemical on an unwitting public . Why ? For what possible reason ? Byers , shut up ! Who gives you the authority ? - No bags . - [ Byers gasps ] - Whoa ! Whoa , whoa ! Guys ! - [ Cylinder clicking rapidly ] [ Clicks ] [ gasps ] Behave yourselves . That 's it ? You 're just trying to intimidate us ? To scare us so we 'll keep quiet ? Byers , I swear to god , I 'll shoot you myself . It 's all true what Susanne said about you people , isn 't it ? About john f . Kennedy ? Dallas ? I heard it was a lone gunman . [ Sirens wailing in distance ] [ Byers narrating ] and that was the last we saw of him . Almost immediately , the police got there . We ... panicked and hid . You know the rest . Do I look like Geraldo to you ? Don 't lie to me like I 'm Geraldo . I 'm not Geraldo ! [ Gasping , exhaling ] [ Langly ] oh , man . It 's not all a bad dream . [ Langly ] I am in hell . Oh . Women . Ain 't it the truth . What do you mean , " women " ? You know exactly what he means . Your molar-Pullin ' girlfriend roped us in and left us swingin ' in the breeze . - Is that what you meant ? - Look . She is hot . But you gotta admit , we 're here because of her . I 'm here because I wanted to learn the truth . I assume that was the same for you . Susanne opened my eyes to it . She doesn 't owe me anything . If there was some way I could help her still , I 'd- - I 'd do it in a second . [ Door opening ] Apparently agent Mulder came to and verified your warehouse story , At least what little he seems to recall of it . Three cheers for the F.B.I. You guys are free to go . Come on . Let 's go . Here 's a tip : aluminum foil makes a lovely hat ... And it blocks out the government 's mind - Control rays . Keep you guys outta trouble . One green nylon wallet containing $ 38 in cash . One ... whatever in the hell this is . Detective ? We got a stolen car that turned up at the train station . - It 's the one that the F.B.I. Agent was driving . - Okay . Susanne must have taken Mulder 's car last night . She left it at the train station . So ? So maybe we can catch up with her . Where ? She took a train . No . She 's too smart for that . Don 't you see ? She just meant to throw them off . She said she wanted to go public . The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station . Susanne ! [ Frohike ] are you okay ? John . They didn 't believe my story . Not a word of it . Who in their right mind would ? - What are you gonna do now ? - Try other newspapers , TV stations , not give up . Keep trying to find people who will listen . People like you . I appreciate what you did for me . All three of you . We still want to help . You already have . [ Phone ringing ] [ Ringing ] Guys ? [ Ringing ] [ Ringing continues ] no matter how paranoid you are , You 're not paranoid enough . [ Ringing continues ] tell the truth . Reach as many people as you can with it . That 's your weapon . - [ Phone ringing ] - [ Tires screeching ] - [ Tires screeching ] - [ Byers ] Susanne ? You feelin ' better ? Yeah , I am . Thank you . I just , um- - I have these weird ideas in my head that I can 't seem to shake . What kinda ideas ? - Weird ones . - Y-You gonna bust us ? I 'm not sure . I just spoke with my A.S.A.C. , and he tells me that dr . Susanne Modeski ... Is no longer wanted by the F.B.I. She 's still missing , but the case is suddenly closed . What I need from you guys is to tell me what the hell happened last night . You want the truth ? Yeah , I want the truth . You might want to sit down . This is gonna take a while . [ Byers ] the truth is none of us is safe . Secret elements within the United States government ... Seek to surveil us and control our lives . [ Mulder ] what ? [ Langly ] tell him about the hotel room bibles . [ Byers ] yeah , I 'm coming to that . It all started with Susanne Modeski .

 THIS IS IT ? I JUST SIGN THIS , AND IT 'S DONE ? AS SOON AS I FILE IT WITH THE CITY CLERK . THIS PEN- - SHE GAVE IT TO ME . IT WAS AN ANNIVERSARY PRESENT . I DON 'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE . WALTER . THEY ARE EXPECTING THE SIGNED DOCUMENTS BY THE END OF BUSINESS TODAY , WHICH WAS TEN MINUTES AGO . I KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS . THEN YOU SHOULD SIGN . WHAT ARE YOU DOING , WALTER ? AFTER 17 YEARS , THEY CAN WAIT ANOTHER DAY . LISTEN . NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN I WHAT AN EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE THIS IS . DON 'T LAWYER ME , JANE . I 'LL DO IT TOMORROW . WHY PUT YOURSELF THROUGH ANOTHER DAY OF THIS ? I SAID TOMORROW . BUCK , I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT . BYE ! I KNOW , THE REGULAR . I 'LL BE RIGHT BACK . EXCUSE ME , ARE YOU HOLDING THIS FOR SOMEONE ? IT 'S THE ONLY OPEN SEAT . GO AHEAD . GOOD EVENING . WHAT CAN I GET YOU ? UH , TONIC WATER WITH LIME , PLEASE . SIR , WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER ONE ? SURE . THANKS . FOR WHAT ? ORDERING ANOTHER DRINK ? THERE 'S A MAN BEHIND ME WEARING A RED TIE . FOR SOME REASON , HE FELT COMPELLED TO TELL ME HALF HIS LIFE STORY . I WAS AFRAID IF YOU GOT UP , HE MIGHT TRY TO GET IN THE OTHER HALF . I GUESS SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU OWE ' EM SOMETHING JUST ' CAUSE YOU 'RE OUT ALONE . DOES THAT EVER BOTHER YOU ? WHAT ? BEING ALONE . [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Growling , Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Gasping ] OKAY . EXCUSE ME , SIR . EXCUSE ME . THANK YOU . I 'M LOOKING FOR DETECTIVE WALTOS . WHO 'S ASKING ? MY NAME IS MULDER . I WORK WITH ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER . I 'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH HIM . AFTER HE GIVES HIS STATEMENT . WE 'RE GONNA FINISH UP AT THE STATION HOUSE . WHY DON 'T YOU JUST GET A STATEMENT HERE ? IT SEEMS THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IS SUFFERING FROM A MINOR MEMORY LAPSE . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Beeps ] YEAH ? MULDER , IT 'S ME . I JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGE . YOU SAID SKINNER CALLED IN A HOMICIDE . IT APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT . SEEMS LIKE HE HAD A FRONT-ROW SEAT . - I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . - I DON 'T UNDERSTAND IT EITHER . THEY 'RE NOT LETTING ME TALK TO HIM . HOLD ON A SECOND . EXCUSE ME , SIR ? I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN , AGENT MULDER , BUT THERE 'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO GET INVOLVED . DETECTIVE . DETECTIVE . DETECTIVE ! WILL YOU AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED ? WHAT DOES HE SAY HAPPENED ? HE CLAIMS HE MET THE VICTIM IN THE BAR DOWNSTAIRS . AFTER A COUPLE OF DRINKS , THEY DECIDE TO GET A ROOM , WHICH IS ALL FINE , EXCEPT WHEN HE WAKES UP , HE FINDS HER LYING NEXT TO HIM WITH A BROKEN NECK . THAT 'S ALL HE SAYS HE REMEMBERS . YOU DON 'T BELIEVE HIM ? HE REFUSED TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH TEST . IT 'S NOT HELPING HIS CREDIBILITY . WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIM ? HAS SHE BEEN IDENTIFIED ? NOT YET . SHE HAD NO PURSE , NOTHING WITH HER NAME ON IT . THERE MUST BE EVIDENCE OF AN INTRUDER OF SOME KIND . AGENT MULDER , I 'VE BEEN ON THE JOB FOR 18 YEARS . I KNOW THE DRILL . THEN IF YOU KNOW THE DRILL , YOU SHOULD BE CANVASSING HOTEL EMPLOYEES , HOUSEKEEPING- - I APPRECIATE THAT HE 'S A COLLEAGUE OF YOURS , BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING : HE 'S ALSO A SUSPECT . DETECTIVE , WHEN YOU 'RE DONE QUESTIONING HIM , I 'D APPRECIATE A CALL . ALL RIGHT . - GET ANY OF THAT ? - MOST OF IT . MULDER , I 'M ON MY WAY . NO , NO , NO , I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BODY . GET DOWN TO THE CORONER 'S . I 'LL MEET YOU THERE . THE CONSPICUOUS ABSENCE OF ANY CONTUSIONS OR LACERATIONS ... WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THE VICTIM 'S INJURIES WERE SUSTAINED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE . FROM MY OBSERVATIONS , I WOULD HAVE TO CONCUR WITH THE COUNTY CORONER 'S REPORT ... THAT HER MURDER WAS MOST PROBABLY A SUDDEN AND VIOLENT ACT ... IN A VULNERABLE MOMENT . BEYOND THIS , I FOUND NOTHING IN MY POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION ... TO RECOMMEND FURTHER INVESTIGATION . BEYOND WHAT ? HER SPINAL CORD WAS CRUSHED , MULDER . THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAE WAS FRACTURED IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE MANUAL TRAUMA . WERE SKINNER 'S THE ONLY PRINTS LIFTED FROM THE BODY ? SO FAR . THEY FOUND NO SEMEN SAMPLES . THERE WAS SOME IRRITATION , PROBABLY AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO LATEX . AT LEAST THEY WERE HAVING SAFE SEX . HAVE THEY LEARNED ANYTHING MORE ? YEAH , HER NAME WAS CARINA SAYLES . SHE WAS LEGAL SECRETARY FOR ONE OF THE CRIMINAL DEFENSE FIRMS HERE IN TOWN . HAVE YOU TALKED TO ANYBODY SHE WORKED WITH ? ONE OF THE PARTNERS . SHE WAS FIRED A FEW WEEKS AGO OVER AN INDISCRETION . AN INDISCRETION ? YEAH , SHE WAS MOONLIGHTING . SHE WAS TAKING A LITTLE WORK FROM ONE OF THE FIRM 'S CLIENTS . WHAT KIND OF WORK ? THIS CLIENT OPERATED AN ESCORT SERVICE . SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE . - GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES HERE . - I 'LL GET THE CAR . ADDENDUM : OBSERVED WHAT APPEARS TO BE A RESIDUAL PHOSPHORESCENCE ... AROUND THE VICTIM 'S MOUTH AND NOSE . NOTE TO HAVE THIS ANALYZED . YES ? LORRAINE KELLER HERE ? SHE 'S BUSY RIGHT NOW . IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH ? BUSY OR NOT , WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH HER . I 'LL TELL HER YOU 'RE HERE . LORRAINE ! BUSINESS MUST BE BOOMING . I THINK YOU MEAN BANGING . WHATEVER THIS IS ABOUT , CAN WE DO IT LATER ? I 'M RUNNING LATE . WE 'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT AN EMPLOYEE OF YOURS- - CARINA SAYLES . SHE DOES WORK FOR YOU , DOESN 'T SHE ? I 'M TEN MINUTES LATE FOR A MEETING WITH HER . THAT 'S ALL RIGHT . I DON 'T THINK SHE 'S GONNA BE MAKING THAT MEETING . OH ? WHY NOT ? SHE 'S DEAD . SHE WAS MURDERED LAST NIGHT . - HOW ? - THAT 'S WHAT WE 'RE STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE . I , UM- - I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY . YOU CAN START BY TELLING US IF SHE WAS WORKING LAST NIGHT . AND IF SHE WAS , WHO PAID FOR HER COMPANY ? - I 'M AFRAID I CAN 'T DO THAT . - I GUESS THAT WOULD HURT FUTURE BOOK SALES , HUH ? - YOU 'D BE SURPRISED WHO SOME OF MY CLIENTS ARE . - NO , I DON 'T THINK I WOULD BE . I ALSO DOUBT THEY 'D WANT TO GET ENTANGLED IN A HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION . LOOK , WE JUST NEED ONE NAME FROM YOU . WHO HIRED CARINA SAYLES ? LET 'S JUST SAY YOU BOTH WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT , AND SO DO I. CUT THE CRAP . WHO HIRED HER ? SHE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT . SHE SAID THAT SHE 'D MET SOMEONE IN A BAR ... WHO WAS INTERESTED IN A TRANSACTION . - I TOOK HIS CREDIT CARD . - THEN YOU HAVE HIS NAME . WALTER SKINNER . THANK YOU . WHAT THE HELL WAS HE THINKING ? IT JUST DOESN 'T SEEM LIKE HIM . YOU THINK HE 'D BE A LITTLE MORE DISCRETE . I THINK THE LACK OF DISCRETION IS THE LEAST OF HIS SINS . STILL NOT ENOUGH TO PROVE ANYTHING CONCLUSIVELY . NO , BUT THAT DOESN 'T MEAN THAT WE CAN DISCOUNT THE EVIDENCE . YOU REALLY BELIEVE SKINNER DID THIS ? LOOK , MULDER , I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT SKINNER AS YOU DO , BUT WE WERE JUST SHOWN A DATED RECORD WITH SKINNER 'S CREDIT CARD NUMBER ON IT . CREDIT CARD FRAUD HAPPENS EVERY DAY . SKINNER WAS IN BED WITH A PROSTITUTE AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH , AND HE 'S OFFERED US NO EXPLANATION OR ALIBI . THE TRUTH IS , WE DON 'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT HIM . WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES OFF-DUTY , WHO HE REALLY IS . WE KNOW THAT HE 'S PUT HIS ASS ON THE LINE FOR US A NUMBER OF TIMES . WE OWE IT TO HIM TO FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED . EVEN IF IT MEANS PROVING HIS GUILT . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] YEAH , MULDER . THANK YOU . WHO WAS THAT ? DETECTIVE WALTOS . SKINNER 'S BEEN RELEASED . SIR ? SIR ? THIS DOESN 'T CONCERN EITHER OF YOU . OF COURSE IT CONCERNS US . WHY WON 'T YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT , SIR ? READ THE POLICE REPORT IF YOU 'RE REALLY THAT CURIOUS . DOES IT EXPLAIN WHY YOU REFUSED TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH TEST ? OR WHY THERE 'S A PROSTITUTE IN THE MORGUE WITH YOUR FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER HER ? YOU DIDN 'T KNOW SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE , DID YOU ? [ Honking ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING , YOU JERK ? [ Horns Honking ] WALTER , I JUST HEARD WHAT HAPPENED . I WAS COMING TO SEE YOU . WALTER ! DO YOU KNOW HIM ? I USED TO THINK SO . I 'M SHARON SKINNER . I 'M HIS WIFE . [ Chattering ] WE WERE JUST A LITTLE CAUGHT OFF-GUARD . NEITHER OF US EVEN KNEW THAT HE WAS MARRIED . HE NEVER TOLD US . WELL , ONE OF THE THINGS WALTER 'S ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT IS KEEPING SECRETS . BUT THE TRUTH IS , WE HAVEN 'T BEEN TOGETHER FOR ALMOST EIGHT MONTHS . HAS HE ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A PRIVATE PERSON ? IT 'S MORE THAN THAT . HE LIVES UNDER THIS MISGUIDED NOTION THAT SILENCE IS STRENGTH . HE 'S BUILT A WALL TO KEEP EVERYONE OUT . INCLUDING YOU ? YEAH , ESPECIALLY ME . IS THAT WHY YOU WERE SEPARATED ? YEAH , I JUST REALIZED ONE DAY THAT WE WERE NO LONGER MARRIED . WE 'D BECOME ROOMMATES INSTEAD . WE WERE PAYING THE BILLS , TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE . I COULDN 'T LIVE LIKE THAT ANYMORE . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] EXCUSE ME . [ Beeps ] SCULLY . YOU WERE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT WALTER EVER MENTIONED FROM WORK . NOT THAT HE SAID MUCH , BUT FROM THE WAY HE TALKED , I COULD TELL HE RESPECTED YOU . THAT 'S PROBABLY WHY I FEEL THAT I CAN ASK YOU . ASK ME WHAT ? IF WALTER REALLY KILLED THAT WOMAN ? SORRY . MULDER , WE 'VE GOTTA GO . YOU 'VE GOT OUR NUMBERS IF YOU NEED TO REACH US . YOU STILL HAVEN 'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION . NO , I DON 'T THINK HE DID IT . WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE ? AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY ? THAT 'S RIGHT . I 'M SPECIAL AGENT BONNECAZE . I 'VE BEEN CALLED UP FROM THE NORFOLK FIELD OFFICE TO COORDINATE THIS INQUIRY . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO DOWN IN NORFOLK , BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED , RIFLING THROUGH A MAN 'S OFFICE WAS CONSIDERED AN INVASION OF PRIVACY . WELL , WE 'RE OPERATING UNDER GUIDELINES SPECIFIED BY THE OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT . A PROTOCOL , I UNDERSTAND , YOU 'VE OPTED TO DISREGARD . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I WANT BOTH OF YOU TO MAKE YOURSELVES AVAILABLE TOMORROW AFTERNOON . AVAILABLE FOR WHAT ? A FORMAL HEARING REGARDING A.D. SKINNER 'S CASE . WHAT CASE ? HE HASN 'T EVEN BEEN CHARGED YET . THE HEARING IS TO ASSESS AND DETERMINE ... HIS ABILITY TO CONTINUE IN HIS POSITION AS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR . IN THE MEANTIME , WE 'LL BE APPOINTING OUR OWN INVESTIGATORS TO PURSUE ANY CRIMINAL CASE . AND I MUST ASK YOU TO STOP LOOKING INTO THIS ANY FURTHER . WHAT ? IN CASE WE TURN UP ANY EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT SUPPORT HIS INNOCENCE ? ANY EVIDENCE YOU MAY HAVE OBTAINED , AGENT MULDER , YOU 'LL BE PRESENTING TOMORROW AFTERNOON AT THE HEARING . [ Line Ringing ] SKINNER 'S NOT ANSWERING HIS PHONE . HE 'S DOING EVERYTHING HE SHOULDN 'T BE DOING . YEAH , WHY ? HE KNOWS BETTER . THE EVIDENCE IS STILL CIRCUMSTANTIAL AT BEST . HE 'S BEHAVING LIKE A GUILTY MAN , MULDER . THE MAN 'S MARRIAGE IS BREAKING UP . HE 'S STRESSED OUT . IT 'S HIS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR THAT CONCERNS ME . IT SPEAKS TO HIS STATE OF MIND . IF AN OTHERWISE STABLE MAN IS COMPELLED TO GO OUT AND HIRE A PROSTITUTE , WHAT ELSE IS HE CAPABLE OF ? PLEASE . GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT . I AM , MULDER , BELIEVE ME . I 'M NOT TRYING TO CONVINCE MYSELF . WHEN I MENTIONED THAT HOOKER TO HIM , HE DIDN 'T EVEN SEEM TO KNOW . WELL , MAYBE HE DOESN 'T REMEMBER . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? EITHER HE REMEMBERS , OR HE 'S A LIAR ? NOT NECESSARILY . [ Scully ] THIS MAN 'S RUNNING AWAY FROM A TRAIN . [ Screaming ] HE SEES IT COMING STRAIGHT AT HIM . HE HEARS ITS WHISTLE . SEVERAL TIMES A MONTH , HE RAN AWAY FROM THAT TRAIN ... UNTIL ONE NIGHT WHEN HE BROKE HIS WIFE 'S ARM WHEN HE THREW HER TO THE FLOOR . NIGHT TERRORS ? NO . NIGHT TERRORS AND SLEEPWALKING OCCUR DURING SLOW-WAVE NON-DREAM SLEEP . THE CLINICAL TERM FOR THIS IS " REM SLEEP BEHAVIOR DISORDER . " ALTHOUGH RARE , DOZENS OF CASES OF SLEEP-RELATED VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO IT . THAT 'S FASCINATING , BUT WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH SKINNER ? THIS VIDEOTAPE CAME FROM THE BETHESDA SLEEP DISORDER CENTER ... WHERE SKINNER HAS BEEN RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS . FROM RUNNING AWAY FROM TRAINS ? SAME DISORDER , DIFFERENT DREAMS . ACCORDING TO SKINNER 'S PSYCHIATRIST , HE 'S BEEN EXPERIENCING A RECURRING DREAM IN WHICH HE 'S CONFRONTED BY AN OLD WOMAN . SHE SPEAKS TO HIM , BUT HE DOESN 'T UNDERSTAND A WORD . SOMETIMES SHE STRADDLES HIS CHEST , SUFFOCATING HIM . SO YOU THINK THAT SKINNER MAY HAVE KILLED THE VICTIM IN HIS SLEEP ? DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST THIS IMAGINARY OLD WOMAN . A LOT OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF THEIR NOCTURNAL ACTIVITIES , WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN SKINNER 'S AMNESIA . THAT 'S NOT SUCH A STRANGE STORY . IT ISN 'T ? IT 'S ANCIENT , ACTUALLY . YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IT , ALTHOUGH NOT IN SUCH CLINICAL TERMS . IN THE MIDDLE AGES , A VISITATION LIKE THE ONE SKINNER DESCRIBED ... WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO A SUCCUBUS . IT 'S A SPIRIT THAT VISITS MEN IN THE NIGHT , USUALLY IN THE FORM OF AN OLD WOMAN . VISITS THEM FOR SEX ? USUALLY . ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THE SUCCUBUS BECOMES SO ATTACHED TO THE MAN ... THAT SHE WOULD KILL ANY WOMAN COMPETING FOR HIS AFFECTION . HERE . - WHAT 'S THAT ? - REPORTS OF RESIDUAL AND LUMINOUS PHENOMENON ... HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SOME SUCCUBUS ENCOUNTERS . AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE MYTHOLOGY . WHY ? I FEEL KINDA STRANGE SAYING THIS , BUT I FOUND SOMETHING ... DURING MY POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE . IT 'S A CIRCULAR PATCH AROUND THE VICTIM 'S MOUTH AND NOSE , APPROXIMATELY 11 CENTIMETERS IN DIAMETER . IT RETAINED LIGHT ENERGY . IT GLOWED IN THE DARK . I KNOW WHAT I SAW , MULDER . IT WAS HERE . THIS PHOSPHORESCENCE REQUIRED NO U.V. OR INFRARED LIGHT ? NO , IT WAS DEFINITELY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE . DID YOU GET A SAMPLE ? YEAH , I SENT ONE OVER TO CHEM / TOX . AND ? WELL , MY FIRST HUNCH WAS THAT IT WAS THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF FUNGAL GROWTH , BUT THE ONLY SUBSTANCE THAT THEY DETECTED WAS AMYLASE , WHICH IS FOUND IN SALIVA . SO I HAD THEM SEND OVER A SAMPLE TO THE ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS UNIT . THE RESULTS SHOULD BE BACK . YES , THIS IS AGENT DANA SCULLY . I 'M CALLING TO FIND OUT THE LAB RESULTS ON A TISSUE SAMPLE ... THAT I SENT IN EARLIER THIS MORNING . THANK YOU . WHAT 'D THEY SAY ? THAT THERE WAS NO ANALYZABLE SUBSTANCE IN THE SAMPLE CONTAINER . ARE YOU SURE YOU SAW SOMETHING ? MULDER , I 'M AFRAID THIS ISN 'T EXACTLY SOMETHING THAT I 'D MAKE UP . MAYBE THAT 'S IT . MAYBE THAT 'S WHY SKINNER 'S RUNNING . HE 'S AFRAID . - THAT HE DID IT ? - THAT HE DOESN 'T KNOW HE DIDN 'T DO IT . [ Knocking ] HI . YOU DIDN 'T ANSWER YOUR PHONE . IT JUST KEPT RINGING . I UNPLUGGED IT . I HAVEN 'T BEEN SLEEPING TOO WELL LATELY . ARE YOU GOING TO INVITE ME IN , OR SHOULD I START BUILDING AN ARK ? COME IN . YOU STILL HAVEN 'T GOTTEN AROUND TO UNPACKING . YEAH , WELL , YOU KNOW , WORK . [ Sighing ] SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE , SHARON ? I 'M NOT SURE . AFTER I SAW YOU TODAY , I DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO . YOU 'RE TRYING TO SATISFY SOME MORBID CURIOSITY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED . THAT 'S NOT WHY I CAME . I JUST- - I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU 'RE OKAY . I 'M OKAY . EXCEPT RIGHT NOW , COMPANY 'S ABOUT THE LAST THING I NEED . I 'M NOT COMPANY , I 'M YOUR WIFE . EX-WIFE . REMEMBER , YOU 'RE THE ONE WHO ASKED FOR THE DIVORCE ? ONLY BECAUSE YOU DIDN 'T HAVE THE GUTS TO ASK FOR ONE YOURSELF , SO DON 'T PUT IT ON ME . FAIR ENOUGH . SO WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY ? NOTHING . I DON 'T WANT YOU TO SAY ANYTHING . I JUST WANT YOU TO LET ME IN . JUST THIS ONE TIME . WHY ? BECAUSE I KNOW YOU . I KNOW THAT YOU 'RE SCARED AND THAT YOU COULD USE SOME COMFORT . I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU 'LL NEVER LET ME GIVE IT TO YOU . JUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF , OKAY ? [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Woman Screaming , Glass Shattering ] [ Knocking ] WHAT 'S THIS ABOUT ? WANNA GRAB YOUR COAT AND COME WITH US ? LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS . WHY ? WHAT THE HELL 'S GOING ON ? - IT 'S YOUR WIFE- - SHE 'S BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT . - IS SHE ALL RIGHT ? SOMEONE RAN HER OFF THE ROAD . YOU 'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME WITH US . [ Sighs ] GOD . WE 'LL ALSO NEED TO SEE THE KEYS TO YOUR CAR , SIR . [ Keys Jangling ] [ Door Closing ] HOW IS SHE ? THE C.T. SCAN SHOWS SUBDURAL HEMATOMA . SHE 'S IN SURGERY RIGHT NOW TO RELIEVE PRESSURE ON HER BRAIN . SCULLY 'S TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION . I HAVE TO SEE HER . CAN 'T DO THAT , SIR . WHY NOT ? THEY SAID I WASN 'T BEING CHARGED . NOT YET , BUT THEY 'RE BUILDING A PRETTY CONVINCING CASE . YOU THINK I DID THIS TO SHARON ? NO , I DON 'T , BUT I 'M IN THE MINORITY . WHAT ABOUT AGENT SCULLY ? SCULLY- - [ Clears Throat ] SCULLY DOESN 'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU 'RE NOT TRYING TO DEFEND YOURSELF . DEFEND MYSELF AGAINST WHAT ? DON 'T YOU THINK IF I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME THAT I WOULD TRY TO- - [ Sighs ] I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE ANYMORE . WHAT ABOUT THE OLD WOMAN IN YOUR DREAM ? WHO IS SHE ? IT 'S GONNA COME OUT . LOOK , IF YOU DON 'T START TRUSTING SOMEONE , YOU DON 'T STAND A CHANCE . [ Sighing ] A FEW MONTHS AGO , I STARTED ... SEEING HER AGAIN . AGAIN ? I TOLD YOU ONCE WHAT- - WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN VIETNAM . I WAS CAUGHT IN AN AMBUSH . YEAH , YOU WERE THE SOLE SURVIVOR . YOU ALSO DESCRIBED WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE . THERE WAS NOTHING NEAR ABOUT IT , AGENT MULDER . I WAS A DEAD MAN . THAT 'S WHEN YOU FIRST SAW HER ? I SAW LOTS OF THINGS OVER THERE . I DIDN 'T GIVE MUCH CREDENCE TO ANY OF ' EM . WHY NOT ? [ Sighs ] I GOT THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE LIKE MOST 18-YEAR-OLDS . BY NUMBING MYSELF WITH WHATEVER WAS AROUND . I WAS NO CHOIRBOY . I- - I INHALED . SO YOU JUST DISMISSED HER AS ANOTHER HALLUCINATION ? I TRIED . BUT YOU COULDN 'T . SHE WAS THERE WITH ME , WATCHING ME , AS I WAS WATCHING MYSELF DIE AND MY BLOOD SPILLING FROM A HUNDRED DIFFERENT PLACES ... UNTIL SHE LIFTED ME UP AND CARRIED ME BACK , AWAY FROM THE LIGHT . MAYBE SHE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU . MAYBE SHE 'S TRYING TO PROTECT YOU NOW . PROTECT ME FROM WHAT ? THAT 'S A QUESTION ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER . I DON 'T KNOW . I DON 'T HAVE A CLUE . NUMBER FIVE . THIS IS SKINNER 'S CAR ? ACCORDING TO WALTER 'S REPORT , THE HOOD WAS STILL WARM WHEN THEY GOT TO SKINNER 'S APARTMENT , EVEN WITH THE RAIN . LOOK AT THE LEFT FRONT PANEL . THEY MATCH THE PAINT IN THE DENT OF SHARON SKINNER 'S CAR . WALTOS 'S PEOPLE FINISH GOING OVER THE INTERIOR ? THE ONLY PRINTS THEY FOUND ON THE STEERING WHEEL WERE SKINNER 'S . CAN I BORROW YOUR FLASHLIGHT ? SURE . WHY ? I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE EXPECTING TO FIND , MULDER , BUT SKINNER 'S HEARING IS IN HALF AN HOUR . I 'LL MEET YOU THERE . WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? COLLECTING EVIDENCE . YOU KNOW HOW AN AIR BAG WORKS ? YOUR CAR HITS SOMETHING , A BAG FILLS WITH AIR , YOU DON 'T DIE . NOT AIR . NITROGEN . NOW , THE LATENT IMAGE , THE ONE WE 'RE INTERESTED IN , IS FOUND IN THE BYPRODUCT OF THAT EXPLOSION ... IN THE FINELY DISPERSED SODIUM METAL THAT COATS THE INTERIOR OF THE AIR BAG . SEE THIS PATTERN HERE ? IT WAS CREATED ... BY WHOEVER WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL WHEN THE AIR BAG DEPLOYED . IT DOESN 'T LOOK LIKE A FACE . NOT YET . FIRST , I 'M SCANNING THE PATTERN , THEN I 'M RUNNING IT THROUGH SOFTWARE ... WHICH TRANSLATES ITS VARYING DENSITIES INTO A DIMENSIONALIZED LIKENESS . AFTER THAT , IT 'S A MATTER OF FINE-TUNING . HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE ? YOU NEED THIS IN A HURRY , IT SOUNDS LIKE . I 'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT . [ Thunder Rumbling ] WE 'RE STILL WAITING FOR AGENT MULDER . YES , SIR . WE 'RE FINISHED WAITING . WE 'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITHOUT HIM . HAVE A SEAT . LET 'S GO OVER THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AGAIN . YOU SAY YOU FOUND NOTHING DAMNING . NO , SIR , NONE OF THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE WE RECOVERED DIRECTLY ... CONNECTS THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR TO HER DEATH . YOU REEXAMINED THE VICTIM 'S BODY . DID YOU FIND ANYTHING OF NOTE ? I TOOK A SAMPLE OF AN EXTRANEOUS SUBSTANCE THAT TURNED OUT TO BE UNIDENTIFIABLE . HOW 'S THAT ? A NATURALLY OCCURRING ENZYME AROUND HER MOUTH AND NOSE . - AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY IT WAS THERE ? - NO . IF YOU ARE WITHHOLDING SOMETHING FROM THIS COMMITTEE- - SIR , I FEEL RELUCTANT TO SAY OR TO SPEAK FOR AGENT MULDER . TO SAY WHAT ? AGENT MULDER HAD A THEORY THAT THE SUBSTANCE COULD HAVE COME FROM A VISITATION . BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER EXPLANATION . NO , I 'M SORRY , I DON 'T . DO YOU BELIEVE IN PARANORMAL PHENOMENA , AGENT SCULLY ? WHATEVER EXTREME CASES I HAVE ENCOUNTERED , I HAVE ALWAYS VIEWED THROUGH THE LENS OF SCIENCE . I BELIEVE THAT IS WHY I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE X-FILES AND TO AGENT MULDER . AND HAS A.D. SKINNER ALWAYS BEEN AS DISCRIMINATING AS YOU ? EXCUSE ME , SIR , I DON 'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION . WOULD YOU SAY THAT , LIKE YOURSELF , YOUR DIRECT SUPERIOR ... HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY- - OR ENCHANTED BY- - AGENT MULDER 'S NOTION- - NO , SIR . NOT AT ALL . AND YET HE CONTINUES TO SIGN OFF ... ON WHATEVER EXTREME CASES ... YOU AND AGENT MULDER ELECT TO INVESTIGATE . I BELIEVE THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR HAS PROTECTED US OUT OF A RESPECT FOR THE WORK . JUST AS YOU MIGHT PROTECT HIM ... BY TRUMPING UP UNIDENTIFIABLE EVIDENCE ? NO , THAT IS NOT TRUE . - THANK YOU , AGENT SCULLY , THAT WILL BE ALL . - SIR , IF I MAY- - - THAT WILL BE ALL ! - I 'M NOT FINISHED . YES , YOU ARE , AGENT SCULLY . [ Cell Phone Beeping ] [ Line Ringing ] HELLO ? MULDER ? HELLO ? YOU MISSED IT . NOT THAT ANYTHING YOU SAID WOULD 'VE MADE A DIFFERENCE . WHAT HAPPENED ? WHERE 'S SKINNER ? OUT OF A JOB . THEY DISMISSED HIM ? HE WOULD 'VE HAD A BETTER CHANCE AGAINST A FIRING SQUAD . THEY USED US TO DO IT , DIDN 'T THEY ? THEY USED THE X-FILES . HOW 'D YOU KNOW ? BECAUSE I THINK SKINNER 'S BEEN OUTMANEUVERED , SCULLY . THEY FOUND A WEAKNESS , AND THEY 'RE EXPLOITING IT . WHY ? TO PUT US IN CHECK . YOU REMOVE SKINNER , YOU WEAKEN US . WHAT AM I LOOKING AT ? THIS IS THE MAN THAT STOLE SKINNER 'S CAR LAST NIGHT AND TRIED TO KILL HIS WIFE . BUT I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WHY ORCHESTRATE AN ELABORATE SCHEME TO SET HIM UP ? WHY NOT JUST KILL HIM ? THEY ALREADY TRIED THAT ONCE . A SECOND ATTEMPT WOULD BE TOO OBVIOUS , EVEN FOR THESE THUGS . ANYWAY , I THINK SKINNER 'S PROBABLY WORTH MORE TO THEM ALIVE AND DISGRACED ... THAN DEAD AND BURIED . WHO IS THIS GUY ? I DON 'T KNOW . DANNY COULDN 'T FIND ANYTHING ON HIM . HE 'S STILL RUNNING IT . SO HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIND HIM ? THIS GUY 'S A PAWN . PAWNS ALWAYS MAKE THE FIRST MOVE . SO HE MUST 'VE HIRED THE PROSTITUTE . [ Chattering ] WHAT HAPPENED ? JUMPER . HAPPENS WHENEVER IT RAINS TWO DAYS STRAIGHT . [ Mulder ] HE GOT TO HER FIRST . MULDER , LOOK . USUALLY THERE 'D BE SOMETHING SET UP IN THE ROOM ... TO GET ... PICTURES , TAPE , WHATEVER . JUDY , WE NEED YOU TO IDENTIFY SOMEBODY . IS THIS THE MAN WHO HIRED CARINA ? HE SAID THAT NOBODY WOULD GET HURT . HE LIED . SKINNER 'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON HE SET UP . ARE YOU SAYING HE KILLED CARINA ? AND LORRAINE . HE 'S CLEANING HOUSE . WE NEED YOU TO ARRANGE A MEETING . I CAN 'T . LORRAINE 'S THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER REALLY TALKED TO HIM . UNFORTUNATELY , LORRAINE CAN 'T GET TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW . PLEASE DON 'T MAKE ME DO THIS . LOOK WHAT HE DID TO YOUR FRIENDS . WE 'RE YOUR ONLY CHANCE OF COMING OUT OF THIS OKAY . YOU KNOW , MULDER 'S RIGHT . I 'LL STAY WITH YOU , IF YOU WANT , UNTIL WE TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY . I WANT YOU TO CALL HIM . TELL HIM YOU 'RE SCARED BECAUSE WE QUESTIONED YOU . TELL HIM YOU WANT MONEY TO GET OUT OF TOWN . YOU 'LL MEET HIM AT THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL BAR . OKAY ? HELLO ? HI . THIS IS JUDY FAIRLY . YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER ME , BUT I WORK FOR LORRAINE . ONE MOMENT , PLEASE . YES ? SOME F.B.I. AGENTS CAME TO SEE ME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO LORRAINE . - WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM ? - NOTHING . I DIDN 'T SAY ANYTHING , BUT THEY SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME . LOOK , I NEED SOME MONEY . THAT CAN BE ARRANGED . - CAN YOU MEET ME ? - WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET ? THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL AT- - IN AN HOUR ? I 'M CLOSE . I 'LL SEE YOU IN AN HOUR . I HAD TO TELL YOU , SHARON , BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS . I 'M NOT SIGNING THOSE PAPERS . FOR A LOT OF REASONS , MOST OF THEM , I 'M JUST ... [ Sighs ] REALIZING MYSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME . SOME OF THE THINGS I 'VE SEEN . THE VIOLENCE AND THE LIES THAT I 'VE WITNESSED MEN INFLICT ON ONE ANOTHER . I CAN NEVER TELL YOU THAT . NOT THAT I EVER STOPPED BELIEVING IN THE WORK , BUT THERE WERE CONTRADICTIONS THAT I COULDN 'T RECONCILE ... WHICH MEANT SHUTTING DOWN PART OF MYSELF JUST TO DO MY JOB . I NEVER TOLD YOU WHAT I SHOULD 'VE TOLD YOU . [ Sighs ] THAT WHAT REALLY GOT ME THROUGH EACH DAY WAS ... KNOWING THAT I 'D BE SLEEPING NEXT TO YOU THAT NIGHT , KNOWING THAT I HAD A REASON TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING . I 'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN EVEN HEAR ME NOW ... OR IF IT EVEN MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO YOU ANYMORE , BUT I AT LEAST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT . [ Gasps ] SHARON ? [ Monitor Beeping ] SOMEBODY- - LISTEN TO ME . [ Ringing ] DID YOU GET HIM ? NO , HE HASN 'T SHOWN UP YET . HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE 15 MINUTES AGO . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? NOTHING . [ Sighs ] GREAT . MAYBE IT 'S THE RAIN . THIS GUY ISN 'T ABOUT TO LET A LITTLE RAIN STOP HIM . [ Door Opening , Closing ] MULDER , HANG ON A SECOND . JUDY ! SCULLY , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? MULDER , GET UP HERE RIGHT NOW . HE 'S UPSTAIRS . JUDY ? [ Water Running ] [ Gasping ] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ? I 'M SORRY . I CALLED , BUT YOU DIDN 'T ANSWER . WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? [ Groaning ] [ Gunshots ] [ Crying ] YOU OKAY ? [ Groans ] SIR ? COME IN . THIS IS OUR REPORT . [ Sighs ] YOU 'LL SEE , THOUGH , THAT SEVERAL QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED . THE IDENTITY OF THE MAN I SHOT ? WE RAN HIS FACE AND FINGERPRINTS THROUGH EVERY AVAILABLE DATABASE . THERE 'S STILL NO MATCHES , AND WE 'RE DOING A DENTAL RECORD SEARCH , BUT THAT 'LL PROBABLY BE A DEAD END TOO . AND REGARDING THE OTHER MAN , THE TELEPHONE NUMBER WE HAD FOR HIM HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED , AND THERE 'S NO RECORD OF AN ACCOUNT . DON 'T WASTE YOUR TIME , AGENT SCULLY . YOU WON 'T FIND HIM . JUST GET WHATEVER FORENSIC EVIDENCE YOU NEED OFF THE BODY YOU HAVE AND BURY IT . IS THERE A PROBLEM , AGENT MULDER ? YEAH , THERE 'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU 'LL FIND MISSING IN THERE . AN EXPLANATION FOR HOW YOU KNEW TO BE AT THE HOTEL LAST NIGHT . I WAS HOPING YOU COULD FILL IN THAT LINE ITEM YOURSELF . I 'M AFRAID I CAN 'T DO THAT , AT LEAST NOT AT THIS POINT IN TIME . WHY NOT ? BECAUSE WHATEVER I BELIEVED MAY HAVE HAPPENED , THAT HAS NO PLACE ON AN OFFICIAL REPORT . THEN WHY DON 'T YOU JUST TELL ME . OFF THE RECORD . IF YOU 'LL EXCUSE ME , I HAVE SOME CATCHING UP TO DO . THE O.P.C. DID A NUMBER ON MY OFFICE . BUT I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE QUICK TURNAROUND ON THIS . [ Boy ] I MADE THIS .

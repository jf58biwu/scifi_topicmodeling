 I told Jarod he was welcome in the crew quarters ... but he said he wanted to be here , nearer the animals . Careful where you walk . He let some of them run free . Let 's see if he left. anything else besides ... this stench . Oh , look at these . Wild Kingdom , National Geographic . Hey , here 's that crocodile guy . " That mammoth snake 's a real beauty , ain 't she ? I 'm gonna try and ride her . " You were saying that Jarod claimed to be an animal behaviorist ? Yeah . Some zoo up north . Some place in , uh - Blue Cove , Delaware ? That 's where I 've been waiting ... since someone failed to notify me about this little road trip . Lyle ... - It 's an oversight . Your people were gonna call my people . - Actually , I was going to say - Watch your step . So , this is all Jarod did ? Just watch TV and , uh , play with his furry friends ? Actually , he spent most of his time in front of the chimpanzee cages . He 'd sit there for hours , mesmerized . Jarod knows the agony of being caged . The prying eyes . That 's why he studied the chimps ... because he related to them . Nah . He just liked watching them do it . It ? - Yeah , you know , mate . Okay , weird time . Hot peppermint-flavored massage oil . Feather ticklers . Edible apparel . I guess it 's all for , uh , for - Sex , Broots . The word is sex . Looks like our little monkey 's in heat . Oh , good morning . You must be Dr. Kinsey . Welcome to the Arnett Center . Thank you , Nurse Plenty ? Plen-tay . - Ah . I took the liberty of getting you all set up . Your daily schedule is here . Your weekly here . Here 's a little pamphlet to explain the phones . And since I didn 't know which you prefer , I brought you tea and coffee . Well , thank you very much . That 's great . At the Arnett Sex Center , satisfaction is our motto . Was there something else you needed ? Oh , yes , Doctor . There is something I need very badly . Uh , Nurse Plenty , I - Plen-tay . - Uh- Oh ! I am so sorry , Doctor . Monique slipped right past me . She 's not really a nurse , is she ? No . She 's your 9 : 00 patient . - Ah . Monique Brooks . Suffering from an uncontrollable urge for sexual role playing . We all like to pretend once in a while , don 't we , Doc ? Uh-huh . There are Pretenders among us . I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and abused . - Life 's a gift . You a doctor ? - I am today . It went from a couple of quickies on the dryer - To the upper deck at Dodger Stadium . We crave daring places . Need daring places . It never occurred to us that we had a problem . Until this . The paramedics said we were lucky falling off the scoreboard like we did . If it weren 't for the peanut guy ? We might have been killed . Hmm . We 've been together five years . And ... we 're still ... you know - unspoiled ... after five years . Well , many people choose to wait . In the grandscheme of things , five years really isn 't that long . We 've been married for four of them . We have some videos here I think might help . Thank you very much ! Just don 't try everything in one night . Excuse me . You must be Dr. Kinsey . That 's what it says on my door anyway . - I 'm Dr. Covney . All my patients call me Allen . - Nice to meet you , Allen . Hey . How many sex therapists does it take to change a lightbulb ? Is there a lightbulb that I can help you change ? It 's just - It 's just a joke . Sort of like the funny ones , only diffierent . Get used to it , Jarod . Sex therapy 's the butt of a lot of jokes . The work we do at this clinic is important . Speaking of which , Dr. Arnett , my 11 : 00 group is waiting . Welcome aboard . - Thank you . Jarod , you got a minute ? - Uh , sure . Syd , do you ever wonder why these dolls ... always have the same surprised expression on their face ? Go ahead . Say it . This is fish in a barrel territory . Tell me about this stuff , boys . Looks like Jarod could use a nice cold shower . Well , his is an inquisitive mind . No reason he wouldn 't use it to explore his sensuality . Syd 's fancy way of saying our boy has his horns up . Horns up . So , did you find anything useful ? Uh , well , basically whatever turns you on , baby . To locate Jarod ? - Still lookin ' . Maybe we 'll get lucky . I 'll keep you posted . - Thank you . Forget to call me again ? Don 't worry , Lyle . You can play with the toys when we 're done . The game 's changing . Due to recent lapses in communication ... I have decided to take a more supervisory role in the hunt for Jarod . From now on , you 'll report every aspect of your search to me . Every aspect . And if we don 't , you 'll go up to the Tower and get us in lots of trouble . Tattletale will go so nicely on your resume . Like you said , watch your step . Reporting to Mr. Lyle can 't be good . Wonder what that means ? I know what it means to me . Nothing . I don 't answer to anyone . Especially my little brother . This is interesting . Shipping invoice , no return address . Just a Web site . Find a real address on that . And , Broots , not a word . But Mr. Lyle just said we 're supposed to ... - Broots . Think of your worst nightmare . Mighty Bobcats from Marrietta University . You must really like these Mighty Bobcats . You 're a therapist . You can use the term obsession . Don 't you have a similar attachment to your alma mater ? I have a strong feeling about the place . Please . Jarod , I want to thank you for stepping in on short notice ... and taking over for Dr. Blass . I have to tell you , I 'm concerned about Dr. Blass 's patients ... how they 're going to make the transition to you . Many have spent a long time developing a trust with her . Well , I 'm going to have to work very hard to maintain that trust . You never realize how many lives are affected when a tragedy like Melissa 's happens . Has her attacker been caught yet ? No . Police are looking for one of her court referral patients - Luke Carlo . Melissa was working with him as a term of his probation . What happened ? Melissa had the admirable tendency to care too much . Carlo was a predator . He took advantage of that . He called her , said he was having a crisis . She ended up downtown in some dive called the Eros Inn . I hear she 's in pretty bad shape . She 's a shell of who she was . I just wish that you could have met the Melissa that we all used to know . She was a wonderful , loving woman . Mr. Truly , do you know why you 're here ? Yeah . Judge Dettman thinks I 'm a pervert . Tony ? I 'm Dr. Kinsey . I 'm the new guy . So , I understand you 're the one who knows everything that goes on around here . Yeah . I live the lowly life of an intern . I 'm also workin ' on my master 's . " Psycho-Sexual Aggression . " " Aberrant Sexual Behavior . " Hmm . Cheery stuff . My honor 's thesis is on sexual predators , and I watch all the court referred sessions ... so I might as well make good use of it . Is this Dr. Arnett working with someone ? - Yeah . This is your standard trench coat and sneaker flasher . Here . Everyone has fears . It 's nothing to be ashamed of . The key is to acknowledge and understand them . Yeah , well , I 'm not afraid of anything . It 's amazing what you can learn about a person 's psyche by just watching them . Mr. Truly , when I was a kid , my father took me duck hunting . I was laying out the decoys and somehow the boat flipped . I got trapped underneath in this tiny air pocket . The water kept rising up my neck , over my chin . I was terrified . I nearly drowned . To this day , I 'm hydrophobic . A shower , fine . But a bath , a swimming pool ... the fear rises in me as fast as the water . See , fear is natural . It 's healthy even . But we 've got to control it . We can 't let " it " control us . Did you observe Dr. Blass 's sessions with Luke Carlo ? The guy that assaulted her ? Yeah . There are tapes of that guy in her office . Scary dude . He was the kind of guy that was just wound too tight . Unfortunately for Dr. Blass , he decided that she was gonna be the one that he went off on . Interesting drawing , Broots . Oh , I was just doodling . It 's nothing . Well , doodling is often the most direct expression of the unconscious . And I couldn 't help notice there was a certain resemblance to Miss Parker . Yeah ? Well , it 's just that she 's so impressive . You know , the way she 's always in control . The way she never shows fear . Oh , God . Fantasies about coworkers are perfectly natural , Broots . I 'd be very surprised if sublimated sexual feelings ... didn 't surface from time to time . - So , what do I do ? Well , you can 't keep these emotions inside . Otherwise they 'll , uh , control you . Oh , no . I 'm not gonna tell her . Tell her what ? Another crush , Broots ? Who is it this time ? That double-chinned chick in , uh , R D ? No . Yeah . Uh , yeah . But it 's two , uh , clefts , one chin . Oh , look . All right , Broots , you stay here and pretend like we 're still searching . Okay . - The less Lyle knows , the better . Aren 't we supposed to report everything we hear ? Aren 't you supposed to have a pair ? Uh , Miss Parker , I 'll stay . I have plenty of things to do here . It 's you and me , cowboy . Saddle up . Good luck , Broots . I don 't know , Doctor . I 'm just so confused . I never had to deal with anything like this before . Gloria , it will be fine , I promise you . We 're gonna get you through this . - Dr . Blass ? Oh , Dr. Kinsey . I 'm sorry . I just needed to look at these old tapes . I heard your voice . You were one of Dr. Blass 's patients ? Oh , well , she was just , uh , helping me with a problem I had with my boyfriend , Eddie . I-I just wanted to hear her advice again . There 's no one else like her . Excuse me . Gloria , it will be fine . I promise you , we 're gonna get you through this . Thank you . I don 't know what I 'd do without you . Oh . Put the package in the box . Oh , I 'm not a deliveryman , Dr. Blass . I 'm a doctor with the clinic . Go away . I don 't need your help . Well , actually , I was hoping to get your help . You see , I 'm taking over your case load at the clinic . There 's a new patient I need some advice with . A young woman . I need to reach her before she slips over the edge . I really wish I could help . I , uh , don 't practice anymore . Maybe not , but I 'm hoping you still care . How do I know you really are who you say you are ? My name is Dr. Jarod Kinsey . Dr. Arnett hired me . I work with Dr. Covney , and Tony is the intern . But anybody could know that . Well , you 're right . But , uh , Gloria ... she 's still having problems with her boyfriend , Eddie . Gloria . Please ? I won 't take up too much of your time . You collect shells . Do you like the ocean ? My grandmother had a beach house when I was growing up . She was my sanctuary . I guess the ocean still reminds me of her . I was just about to put on some tea . So , you said something about a new patient ? Yes . She 's suffering from a generalized anxiety disorder ... brought on by emotional trauma . Symptoms ? Insomnia , panic attacks and an overwhelming sense of fear . The thing is , deep down inside , I think she really wants to get better ... but the fear stops her . Some days she 's too scared to even get out of bed . Her heart races , she can 't breathe . She feels like she 's losing control . The thing that really worries me is she 's beginning to think ... that ending it all is the only way out . There 's no new patient , is there ? Like I told you before , I don 't want your help . Maybe if you just talked about the night you were attacked ? No , I can 't . - Just try . Look , my head is all just twisted and jumbled . - Melissa ? Just try . I went downtown to this hotel one of my pa - one of my patients was staying in . Luke Carlo . The door was open , so I walked in . There was a ... hand clamped over my mouth . And ... a blindfold . Handcuffs . Handcuffs with Luke Carlo 's fingerprints on them ? Luke . I thought he was getting better , you know ? I thought I was helping him . You have to go now . - It 's not a very good idea for you to mix those things . I know that . Can you please just go ? We should just go sit ... - Please go ! Okay . Okay . It 's not like I ever hurt anybody . I just like to look , all right ? No , it is not all right . You are victimizing these women . So what we have to do is find a better way ... for you to deal with your sexual impulses . Deal with them . Lady , you have no idea what it 's like in my neighborhood . Around here , sex is all secrets and whispers . There it 's sold in the streets . It 's in your face 24-7 . It doesn 't take a genius to figure out why they call it the " Flesh District . " It doesn 't take a genius ... to figure out why they call it the " Flesh District . " The " Flesh District . " The " Flesh District . " Excuse me . I 'm looking for this guy . I don 't see nobody . Nobody sees you . The best eyes to see the world with are invisible . You 've spent some time on the streets . You could say that . He 's supposed to be a regular around here . Walked by here just a minute ago . I see him around here all the time . When in doubt , liquor store down the street . There he is , right there . - Thanks . What do you want with me ? I want to talk to you about Dr. Blass . I didn 't have nothin ' to do with that . Is that why you 're pointing a gun at me ? - I didn 't do it . I 'm tellin 'you . I didn 't ... do it ! I didn 't do it ! This isn 't sleazy . It 's Beaver Cleaver 's house . Behind all the aluminum siding , suburbia 's a freak show . Miss Parker , can I ask you something ? You see , Sydney has this theory about expressing your feelings ... not bottling up your emotions . Is this more about you and the chins ? Yeah . Uh , no . Well , kind of . - Broots . No woman worth her salt wants to be with a guy who spills his feelings all over the floor . You like this chick , either make a move or move on . Hi . We 're here to shop . I don 't know what you 're talkin about . - Something exotic for hubby ? I 'm afraid I can 't help you . I guess Jarod lied to us , honey . Whoa , whoa , whoa . You 're friends of Jarod 's ? Come on in ! Sorry about the hassle . Gotta keep a low profile for the neighbors . This is my wife , Linda . I 'm Roy . God bless the Internet . A few months ago-sex toys , experimenting-it was just a hobby with us . Of course , I don 't have to tell you two about that , now do I ? Mmm . It 'd be nice if you didn 't . So , uh , Roy , how do you know Jarod ? Never met . Except in chat rooms and the humongous order he laid on us . It got my wife 's attention , I can tell you that . Yeah , we 're still shippin' him stuff on back order . Really ? You know , he just recently moved . You don 't happen to have his new address , do you ? - Well , yeah . I think he gave it to us , yeah . Yeah . 1248 Wren Park , Wyattville . Yeah , 1248 Wren Park . That-That 's it . Why don 't you two come into the den . We 'll open up the sloe gin ... and see what kind of natural wonders occur ? I prefer my natural wonders in national parks . But thank you . Oh , come on , I just laid some brand-new shag . It 's three-quarter pile , extra thick padding . Makes for some comfy cuddling ' . Are you talkin ' about the four of us ? - You two swing , don 't ya ? Very tempting , Roy . However , I could never share this stud muffin with anyone . Maybe next time . Buh-bye . Yeah , it 's me . They just left . Jarod ? I heard you went to see Melissa last night . Yes , I did . - I 'm surprised you got in . Most of the time she 's not even answering the phone . How is she ? - She 's not doing well . She 's obviously paranoid and she 's exhibiting obsessive-compulsive behavior . Now I realize she 's been traumatized ... but I 'm sensing there 's something , something else going on with her . So , you think there could be deeper issues at work ? Perhaps . I 'm not sure . I was hoping maybe you could tell me . Up until all this , Melissa Blass was one of the most solid , stable people I 've ever known . Jarod , please . I don 't want to talk . I have a delivery this time . How would you like to take a walk on the beach ? Jarod , this is crazy . We 're shrinks . Crazy is our business . I want you to close your eyes . Close your eyes . Imagine yourself at your grandmother 's beach house . Remember how safe you used to feel there . Hear the surf rolling in and out . Feel the warm sun on your face . Nothing bad can ever happen to you here . And so I walked in . There was a hand clamped over my mouth . Blindfold . Handcuffis . Handcuffs . Handcuffs . - Jarod , I know what you 're doing . I use sensory-relaxation exercises all the time with my patients . And you know that they work . It 's very important that we talk about the night you were attacked . But I told you everything I could . I need to know if you actually saw Luke Carlo . Did you actually see him ? Well , he called me and lured me down there . But did you see him ? Well , I don 't know . I don 't remember . I - No . I guess I-I mean I never-No , I didn 't . But why would anyone else want me there ? Damn it ! Oh ! Pronil ? - Just a mild sedative . Dr. Covney filled this ? He handles all the meds at the clinic . Oh , hey , Jarod . - Dr . Covney . Something wrong ? - How often are mistakes made on prescriptions around here ? Never . Why ? - Because this was given to a patient ... in a bottle marked " Pronil . " - Daronex ? Well , this is wrong . This is really wrong . Pronil 's a sedative . But Daronex - its main side effect is heightened anxiety . A steady diet of these will push just about anybody over the edge . Then explain to me why you gave it to Melissa Blass ? Melissa ? Now wait a minute . I did not fill that prescription . Your name 's on the bottle . - I 'm the one with the med permit . My name is on all the labels . But I didn 't fill that one . Dr. Arnett did . He takes care of Melissa 's meds personally . But I can 't believe he 'd make a mistake like that . Neither can I. We tried what you suggested , Dr. Kinsey . Making love at home , behind closed doors , in your own bedroom . Yeah . It was good . Unfortunately , I got a little out of control . I couldn 't help myself . I opened the curtains . - And then it got great . We had no idea we had so many nice neighbors in our apartment complex . It 's reallya shame we 're gonna have to move now . Give me an " S " ! " S " ! Give me an " E " ! " E " ! Give me an " X " ! " X " ! Sex ! Thank you , Monique . Please put your clothes on . It 's not the nicest place Jarod 's ever lived . Better than swinger 's central . Come here . Yeah . Give me a boost . Broots ? - Oh , yeah , okay , right . One . Two . Three . Broots ! - Oh , yeah , okay . Damn it ! I 'm so tired of being late for the party . Shh . Miss Parker , we might not be late this time . Look at all this stuff . Today 's paper . Food , clothes , a D. S. A. player . This computer 's still warm . Jarod 's still living here . This is too important not to tell Mr. Lyle . Don 't you think this is important enough that we have to let him know ? Sorry . I-I get hungry when I 'm nervous . Pistachio ? - Broots , when exactly ... did we find that receipt in the box from Jarod 's lair ? Right after Mr. Lyle left . We 're out of here . - What ? Why ? Wait . Miss Parker ? Wait , don 't leave me here . I can 't believe the difference . I already feel so much clearer . I should 've known something was wrong with those other pills . How could you ? They both look exactly alike ... and with what the Daronex was doing to your mind . Melissa ? I think it 's time that we had a real talk ... about what happened to you . Look , you can put locks on your doors , you can put bars on your windows . But they can 't keep out the fear inside of you . Yeah , but I already told you everything I could . The rest just isn 't there . Then let 's go further back ... to the first time you were attacked . How did you know ? - Call it ... a doctor 's hunch . It was back in college . You went to Marrietta University with Dr. Arnett . Yeah . I was , uh , coming home late one night after studying . I was , uh , passing by one of the old dorms . A man in a mask jumped out of the shadows ... grabbed me and pulled me inside . They never even caught him . But you bounced back . Yeah , I did . I really did . I got counseling , I-I worked really hard to become me again . But always in the back of my mind ... part of me is just ... shattered . I don 't know if I can bounce back this time . No . No more crutch . It 's time to figure out what really happened downtown that night . But how , Jarod ? By asking someone who knows . Luke , I want you to just imagine somewhere very peaceful . It 's very safe . Tell me what you 're seeing . - Trees . Lots of green grass . That 's a-a park I go to sometimes , not far from here . There 's a-a bench I like to sit on . I look up at the clouds . Are you hearing anything ? - Music . There 's a-a guy who 's always there ... and he brings his cello . It 's really soothing ... sitting on the bench ... just listening to the cello . You were right , Luke . It is relaxing here . What the hell ? - You can run all you want . But your guilty conscience will be tapping you on the shoulder wherever you go . Look , I told you . I 'm not guilty of nothin ' . I didn 't attack Dr. Blass . I know . But someone made you lure her to that hotel room . Why ? Dr. Arnett attacked her , didn 't he ? I didn 't wanna call her . I like Dr. Blass . She was the first person who really seemed to care about me . But one night , after a session ... Arnett grabbed me . He told me he 'd make me a deal . He said that if I got her to the hotel , he wouldn 't report me . I was , like , report me for what ? Missed appointments . Probation violations . Whatever he could make up . He said sending a deviant like me back to prison was easy . So either I called or he did . The next day , when I heard ... I was , like - I felt like I was gonna puke . Dr. Blass always said ... " Recovery is a long road . " But one step at a time ... will get you there . And I was taking those steps . I was getting better , thanks to her . Why didn 't you come forward ? My word versus Arnett 's ? A lowlife like me against the respected doctor ? No one will ever lay a finger on him . Don 't bet on it . Jarod . You 're working late . Yes . I have a case that 's starting to trouble me . Anything I can help you with ? Maybe you can . Being that you have such an insight ... into the mind of sexual predators . You see , I 'm having trouble understanding his motivation . Well , you know , Jarod , it 's control . Sex may be the avenue they choose ... but the underlying motivation - it 's always control . To get it , he puts his victim down . He debases their humanity . It 's the only way the predator can convince himself he 's worthy . And if he refuses to seek treatment ? Without admission of responsibility ... there 's very little hope for improvement . Then I guess I 'd better find a more radical form of therapy . Thank you for your ... insight . Everyone has fears . To this day , I 'm hydrophobic . So , Monique , you wanna play dress-up ? Really ? Melissa ? Melissa , is that you ? Melissa , I didn 't know you were out of the house these days . Monique ? Jarod . - Just a B-12 shot , Dr. Arnett . Whoops . It 's a sedative . Don 't you just hate it when medications get switched ? Jarod ? - Relax , Doctor . You 're strapped down and going nowhere . Welcome to the Eros Inn , Doc . Oh , that 's right . You 've been here before . What the hell are you doing ? Just tryin ' to help you relax . And what 's more relaxing than a nice , warm bath . No , no ! No , don 't ! Don 't , don 't , don 't ! - That 's right . Hydrophobia . You really should see a therapist about that . Jarod , you 're crazy . What 'd I ever do to you ? Oh , it 's not what you did to me . It 's what you did to Melissa Blass . You 're out of your mind . Everybody knows Luke Carlo attacked her . Not everyone . Allow me to float my theory . Damn it , Jarod ! You can 't do this ! It 's all about control . Like back when you were in college , when you were a Mighty Bobcat . The way you took control over those four innocent girls . You don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . I may not have all the details , but I do have the broad strokes . Oh , speaking of strokes ? Do you know yours ? Breaststroke . Backstroke ? 'Cause you 're going to need them the way this water level 's rising . I swear ! - Now you know how Melissa felt . Powerless . Drowning in her very worst fear . Why are you doing this ? - Because you did it to her ! Jarod , no ! Please don 't ! It was her fault ! I put her down 12 years ago ! She should 've stayed down ! But she didn 't ! She wouldn 't let what you did to her destroy her ! She kept rubbing it in my face . - Then you tried to ruin her for good . From the day you hired her at the clinic , every day since then ... you 've been planning her second assault . She had to learn her lesson ! Now it 's time that you learn yours . She had to learn her lesson ! Like you said , Doc , everyone has fears . Miss Parker , I was starting to worry . I hadn 't heard any developments in your Jarod pursuit . That 's because there was no Jarod pursuit , was there , Lyle ? It was all just a setup . The bogus shipping report ... the fake lair with all the sex toys . The swinging couple , however , was a very cute touch . You don 't usually show so much imagination when trying to screw me over . I don 't have the foggiest idea what you 're talking about . Next time , do your homework . Jarod 's allergic to pistachios . God , she 's amazing . - Go on , tell her . No , Syd . Women don 't wanna be told . They wanna be shown . It 's time I make my move . Broots , I 'm flattered . In fact , it 's kind of sweet . But it 's never gonna happen . Good luck with the chinny-chin-chin . Oh , that sun feels nice . Well , it 's a start , huh ? Today the porch , tomorrow the world . Melissa , there 's a lot of people who miss you ... who want - who need your help . Well , I 'm sure helping them ... will be the best therapy for me . One step at a time is the best therapy . Jarod , thank you . Good luck .

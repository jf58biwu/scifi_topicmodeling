 Captain 's Log , Stardate 48693.2 . We 've altered course to investigate some unusually intense photonic activity in a nearby protostar . Lieutenant Torres and I are beaming aboard samples for further analysis . Containment field is active . We 're ready for transport . Energize . That 's strange . Both containers should have been filled . Here 's the problem . A slight breach in the annular confinement beam . I 'm aborting transport . Okay , let 's try that again . Energizing . All right . I 'll get a complete phase spectrum analysis on this as soon as possible . If this photonic matter works as well as I think , it could boost the efficiency of our power converters 15 percent . I 'd say more like 20 . How long will it take to finish the preliminary analysis ? Um , six hours , maybe more . I 'd like to get it sooner than that . I believe Ensign Kim is off duty . Could you use his help ? Can you convince him to give up his free time ? I think I might be able to . Janeway to Kim . That 's odd . Computer , locate Ensign Kim . Unable to comply . Ensign Kim is not aboard the ship . Sensor logs show no record of any unauthorized transporter activity , and all shuttlecraft are accounted for . If Ensign Kim left the ship , he did not do so by conventional means . His last shift ended four hours ago , and he was scheduled for time on Holodeck 2 when he went off duty . No one has seen him since . Scan the holodeck . What 's the matter ? There is significant interference in the holodeck . I cannot obtain a clear scan . Is it a system malfunction ? I do not believe so . Commander . The holodeck is definitely active . There appears to be a program in progress . Can you shut it down ? The manual overrides are not functioning . I cannot terminate the program . All right , let 's go in . Computer , identify program . The program in progress is a holonovel based on the epic Earth poem Beowulf . Beowulf ? An ancient English epic set in sixth century Denmark , if I remember correctly . It 's about a hero named Beowulf who fights a creature that 's terrorizing a kingdom and murdering its subjects . Monsters and swordplay , that sort of thing . I 'm not detecting any life signs , but there is still considerable interference . I can 't determine the source . Speak as a friend or stand challenged . Computer , delete character . The holodeck command systems must not be functioning either . We must also consider the possibility that the safety programs are malfunctioning as well . I 'm am Freya , shield-maiden , daughter of King Hrothgar . I hold this guard post against any intruders who would bear us harm . So declare yourselves . I will hear your answer before you march any further through this land . We have no desire to trespass . However , we are on an urgent mission , so if you would allow us to continue , we would appreciate it . What land do you call home ? Your faces tell me you are not men of the Danes . Are you ... kinsmen of Beowulf ? Yes . We are Beowulf 's kinsmen . My name is Chakotay , and this is Tuvok . Have you seen Beowulf ? Yes . He was like no other . Hair straight and raven black , eyes bright with fierce fire , the burning gaze of a hero . Grandiloquence notwithstanding , that would qualify as a description of Mr. Kim . How did you know he was Beowulf ? This is Harry 's holonovel . It 'd make sense that he 'd be playing the hero . She might be able to help us figure out what happened to him . A reasonable assumption . Your kinsman was a truly noble warrior . It is right you should avenge his death . Yes , but first , we 'd like to know more about how Beowulf died . Of course . Come . I will take you to the king . Hail , Lord Hrothgar . I bring new friends , Chakotay and Tuvok , kinsmen of Beowulf , who come to avenge his death . Greet them well . I would bid you welcome to my hall , but the days of glad tidings are gone from this place . We grieve with you for your kinsman . We had hoped that a warrior of Beowulf 's strength and renown would be able to deliver us from our curse . Could you tell us exactly what happened to him ? He met with the same fate as did 30 of our own warriors . Grendel . That 's the monster who 's been attacking you . Repelled by light and laughter , the beast waits until we slumber . Then , bereft of remorse , Grendel comes in murderous rage to my hall to take my people , and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it . If you are wise , you will forego your vengeance and return home . Death lives here now . My Lord is fatigued . It is time to retire . We would like more information about Beowulf . Would it be possible to examine his body ? The body of Beowulf is gone . Dragged down to Grendel 's foul lair , no doubt . The beast leaves no traces . Did anyone actually see the battle ? No . Beowulf chose to face Grendel alone . Then I think we 'd like to see this Grendel for ourselves . To what purpose ? To raise false hopes in our king again as did your kinsman ? Leave us alone in our misery . Unferth ! These men are our guests . You will show them the hospitality they deserve . They deserve nothing ! If their Beowulf was truly the champion he claimed to be , then Grendel would be dead , his head mounted on a spear . Instead , we spend yet another night in terror . If you would allow us to assist you , perhaps we could help alleviate your terror . Your names mean nothing to me . There are no songs of your deeds nor stories of the battles you have fought . Who are you to believe you can slay Grendel ? We have no intention of slaying anyone . We simply wish to examine the creature . Grendel might not wish to be examined ... without a fight . And if you would fight Grendel , then you will first prove your worth to me . Defend yourselves . You are able warriors . You may stand sentry tonight . You are brave men . I hope to see you again , fate permitting . Chakotay to Janeway . Go ahead . Captain , we haven 't found any definite signs of Harry , but we 've encountered several holodeck characters who claim to know what happened to him . Mr. Kim was running a holonovel based on the poem Beowulf . According to the holo-characters , he attempted to battle a creature of some kind and was killed in the process . Killed ? Since the safety programs are malfunctioning , we must consider the possibility . But ... you haven 't found a body ? No . If we shut down the program , we 'd know if he 's here or not . Run a diagnostic on the holodeck 's imaging control systems . If they 're not working , try to repair them . And relay your tricorder scans to the Bridge . I 'd like to analyze your readings . Aye , Captain . Chakotay out . The primary imaging matrix should be here behind this wooden panel . I will attempt to locate the auxiliary matrix . This ancient Earth culture seems fascinated with monsters . Every culture has its demons . They embody the darkest emotions of its people . Giving them physical form in heroic literature is a way of exploring those feelings . The Vok 'sha of Rakella Prime believe that hate is a beast which lives inside the stomach . Their greatest mythical hero is a man who ate stones for 23 days to kill the beast , and became a saint . Such fables are necessary only in cultures which unduly emphasize emotional behavior . I would point out there are no demons in Vulcan literature . That might account for its popularity . Bridge to Chakotay . Chakotay here . Commander , we 've analyzed your tricorder data . A deep-level scan shows minute quantities of photonic energy . How could it be in the holodeck ? We think it happened when we beamed aboard the samples from the protostar . There was a breach in the annular confinement beam , and photonic energy must have leaked into the transporter system . And from there into other ship systems as well . We 've already found some in the replicators . That raises an uncomfortable possibility , Captain . If the holodeck 's conversion nodes were contaminated , Ensign Kim may have inadvertently undergone the process of matter conversion . You 're saying he might have been converted into energy ? We have to consider it a possibility . After all , the holodecks are basically an outgrowth of transporter technology . Changing energy into matter and back again . Every time a program is run . Except it 's not supposed to convert people . Hold on , Captain . Something 's coming . It is an object approximately one meter in diameter . I think Grendel may be paying us a visit . Captain , the holo-characters told us Kim was killed by Grendel . An examination of this part of the program might be advisable . Proceed . Captain , I 'm picking up signs of matter / energy conversion . Emergency transport . Get them out of there now . I can 't get a lock . Commander Chakotay , report . Mr. Tuvok ? Captain , I 've lost their life signs . They 're gone . This is a scan of the holodeck just before we lost contact with Chakotay and Tuvok . The readings are pretty garbled , but I 'm still inclined to think that there is a malfunction in the holodeck 's matter conversion nodes . Photonic energy leaking into the subsystems could certainly damage the nodes , and it might have created a defect in the program that occurs when Grendel shows up . A defect that dematerialized our people . I 'm not willing to accept the fact that Harry and the others are gone for good . Their molecular patterns might still be there . And if they are , we might be able to rematerialize them . The only thing we can do is go back into the holodeck . Study this ... energy surge . Find out what exactly happened . Anyone who goes back in there might wind up just like the others . Maybe not anyone . Me ? A hologram can 't be converted into energy . It already is energy . You 're the perfect choice . How do you intend to transfer me out of Sick Bay ? We 'll have to modify your data stream protocols and imaging systems , but the fact that you 're going to the holodeck simplifies things . The projection systems are already in place there . And we 're going to give you complete control over your magnetic containment field . You 'll be able to make yourself solid , or let matter pass through you at will . Nothing on the holodeck will be able to touch you- - unless you want it to . I see . Think of this as your first away mission , Doctor . Think of this as your first away mission , Doctor . I can understand your hesitation , but there are three lives at stake , and you have the best chance of anyone on this ship to save them . Do you understand that ? Yes . Good . Your job is to find the photonic energy surge and scan it closely . We need all the data we can get . You 'll have to interact with the characters in the holonovel , so make sure you 're familiar with the Beowulf story . Your circuit modifications will be finished in three hours . Yes , Captain . Computer , access full text of ancient Earth epic Beowulf including historical annotation and cultural references . Data compilation in progress . Doctor ? Ah , Kes . Come in . I don 't know how long I 'll be gone , but my absence is no reason to suspend your studies . How are you doing with the protein synthesis text ? I finished it yesterday . Good . Then you may as well start learning how to operate the base-pair sequencer . You 'll find the manual in the technical data base . Was there something else ? There 's something bothering you . Not at all . Now if you 'll excuse me , I have a great deal of preparation to do . You 're nervous about this mission , aren 't you ? Nervous ? I can perform emergency surgery without getting nervous . I can make life-or-death decisions about patients without getting nervous . What makes you think I 'm nervous ? Those things are familiar to you . You 've been programmed to do them , but ... this is different , isn 't it ? I can describe every detail of every piece of equipment in this Sick Bay- - from bio-bed to neurostimulator- - but I 've never even seen a sky or a forest , let alone Vikings and monsters . I can 't afford to fail . But I don 't know what to expect in that holodeck . You 've been telling me that you deserve to be treated like a member of the crew . Well , here 's your chance . And I can tell you that none of the crew knows exactly what to expect when they go on an away mission . Doctor , have you chosen a name for yourself yet ? I have narrowed the list to three possibilities . Then let me suggest you choose one before you go . It might help you feel more like a Starfleet officer . Hmm . You may be right . I 'll give it some thought . And Kes ... thank you . Good luck . Paris to Janeway . We 're ready for the transfer , Captain . Good . Go ahead . How about you , Doctor ? You ready ? Of course . I 've already transported a tricorder onto the holodeck . Engaging transfer circuits ... now . Is everything all right , Doctor ? Yes . There were no problems with the transfer . I 'm on my way . Speak as a friend or stand challenged . I am ... Yes , you 're Freya , the king 's daughter . A female warrior known as a shield-maiden . We have never met , and yet you know my name ? Are you a sorcerer ? No . It 's simply that ... your reputation precedes you . A warrior of your skill ... you 're quite famous where I come from . I did not know that word of my deeds has carried to other lands . Tell me what you have heard . Well ... your battle with ... Scyld the Gar-Dane ? ... is practically legend . An incredible story . I burned his hall to the ground . There was nothing left but ashes ! Charming . And did you hear of my campaign against the heatho-bards to the south ? I fought them for ... I 'd be delighted to hear all about it , but I 'm on an urgent mission of my own . I 'm looking for Grendel . Only a warrior would seek that which others flee . What is your name ? I 'm glad you asked . My name is ... Schweitzer . Dr. Schweitzer . " Schweitzer . " A hero 's name . Come , I will take you to the king . Hmm . The hall is not far from here . Look- - fortune is with us . Atuta- - a most powerful plant . What exactly do you intend to do with it ? We brew the atuta into a broth , which we drink before battle . It brings on the spirit of the bear , and gives us strength to swing our swords . It 's more likely to bring on profuse sweating , convulsions , and acute delirium . This is an Amanita muscaria- - a fungus common to subartic climates , and , let me assure you , quite poisonous . Yes , but those it does not kill , it makes strong . A most hearty plant . Are you a master of herb-lore ? Well , in a way , I suppose I am . You are truly a man of many talents , Lord Schweitzer . Your people must value you greatly . You would think so . Hail , Lord Hrothgar ! I bring a new friend , Schweitzer , who has come to destroy Grendel . Greet him well . I would bid you welcome to my hall , but the days of glad tidings are gone from this place . I 'm sorry to hear that , but with your permission , sir , I 'd like to stay here tonight , and wait for Grendel . To what purpose ? To raise false hopes again , as have others before you ? Leave us alone in our misery . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . I have a mission . Your name means nothing to me . There are no songs of your deeds nor stories of the battles you have fought . Who are you to believe you can slay Grendel ? I 'm simply a ... warrior . I 'm only concerned with Grendel . I have no quarrel with you . Indeed you do , and if you will fight Grendel , then you will first prove your worth to me . Defend yourself ! Fate be with you . If this is your best , then you should thank me . Grendel would destroy you with far greater ease than I. This is absurd . So be it . You might want to put some ice on that . It 'll take down the swelling . Our time of deliverance is at hand . We have been given a new champion- - one whom weapons cannot hurt . The one who will destroy Grendel and end our suffering . All hail the hero ! - All hail Schweitzer ! - All hail Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Schweitzer ! Eat , eat . What is it ? Elk . When I built this hall , the forest ran thick with them , but today , game 's more scarce . Enjoy it , Lord Schweitzer . It is a great delicacy in our land . Hmm . It 's quite good . We rarely hear stories of other lands . Honor us with a tale of your home to gladden our hearts . I 'm not much of a storyteller . Please ... indulge us . Yes , tell us a tale of your prowess in battle . Well , there was the time I managed to stop the spread of Parinisti measles before it became epidemic . For a while , things were touch and go . Six people came down with it . Fortunately , I was able to isolate the endoplasmic virus and replicate it in order to form an antibody . Even then , it wasn 't altogether clear I could create an effective vaccine . But I worked at it for 7 4 hours straight , and managed to create an inoculation that successfully protected the crew . You 'll excuse me , my Lord , if I take leave of this ... folly . A truly unique tale . Come , Lord Schweitzer . Allow me to show you my home . If you are in need of anything , please do not hesitate to ask . All I need is to find Grendel . You are a true champion- - always ready for the fight . Ah , perhaps you would like some mead to fortify yourself for battle ? No , thank you . I 'm fine . Away . You 're disturbing Lord Schweitzer ! It was with that weapon I made my first kill . I was 1 1 years old . You killed someone when you were 1 1 ? Well , it 's a poor weapon , I agree , but a token of my youth . You must have similar trophies from your own childhood . I ... don 't remember much about my childhood . Well , I am certain you distinguished yourself in battle many times and did honor to your father . My Lord , it grows late . It is time to retire . Always with you it is time to sleep . Perhaps you have forgotten that the work of a warrior is battle , not rest ! You would do well to learn from Lord Schweitzer . This was a beautiful hall once ... before Grendel . You will make it so again . You have our thanks . I appreciate your faith in me , Sire . Come , my lord . You may have deceived them with your tricks , but the king is old and desperate for hope , and the rest are just fools ! You have nothing to worry about , Unferth . Once I 'm done with Grendel , I 'll be leaving . We shall see . The morning will prove if your deeds are as strong as your words . The nights here are cold . I wanted to make certain you were comfortable . I appreciate your concern . I thought everyone had gone to sleep . Sleep does not come easily in this place . Not anymore . I was taught the world would end in winter . First , there would be a desperate cold , followed by a demon who would devour the sun . It has been long since we felt summer , and a demon does walk these halls . Freya ... your world isn 't coming to an end . Perhaps not , but it has changed . Every night the monster comes , and every day our numbers are lessened , and no one will speak of it . No one speaks of the fear that he will be next . But each meal becomes quieter than the last , and after a time , we barely speak at all . Do you know what it is to be alone among many , and unable to speak your fears ? I think I do . How do you survive ? I 'm still learning how . I 'm sure that 's not very helpful . Sometimes I believe I can see the moment of my own death . It comes in battle , I think , my sword raised high . It is said that fate often spares a doomed warrior , if his courage can prevail . But there have been days when I felt my own courage falter ... and then you came . I 'm glad I could help . Perhaps I can help you . Before combat , it is most important to stay warm . Well , you 've done an excellent job with the fire , I 'm sure I 'll ... Fire is not the only heat , Lord Schweitzer . You know where I sleep . Holodeck to Bridge . We 're monitoring you . Captain , I 'm picking up readings of photonic energy . Captain , it 's right in front of me . It 's some kind of ... photonic energy formation . Emergency ! Get me out of here ! Now ! Sick Bay , emergency transfer . I 'm on it . Sick Bay , report . Uh ... I have him , Captain ... more or less . I think you better come take a look at this . How does it feel ? Just like the old one , actually . Apparently , contact with photonic energy disrupted your magnetic cohesion , but we 're still not sure if that 's what happened to the others . Captain , take a look at this . The readings from the Doctor 's tricorder when the energy surge made contact with him . They 're showing a synaptic pattern . I wouldn 't expect to see something like this in photonic energy . Is this the first time those patterns have shown up like this ? Yes , but it 's the first time we 've had clear readings from a moment of contact . I wonder if I could produce these same patterns in the samples we have in Engineering . If you can , you might be able to get more information about how photonic energy damaged the holodeck systems . I 'm on it . I 'll give you a hand . Okay ... I 've initiated a polarization field . I 'm introducing it into the container . We 're getting a reaction . It 's producing a synaptic pattern all right- - highly complex . What 's that ? Whatever it is , it 's cutting through the bulkheads . Let 's get a containment field around it . It 's heading for Deck 14 , Section C-5 . Okay , now I 've got a containment field blocking it . Whoa . It 's changing direction . It 's like it 's avoiding the containment field . Let 's give it another try . Now it 's blocked on three sides . It 's changing course . Heading for the open side . Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? Those synaptic patterns ... could be some sort of neural net . We may be dealing with a life-form . Bridge to Engineering . Torres here . We 're detecting an energy mass moving through the ship . Right . It broke through the sample container . Captain , it 's showing the properties of a life-form . A life-form ? It seems to have a neural net , and it 's demonstrating signs of intelligent behavior . It 's cutting it 's way through the ship . Heading for the outer hull . It 'll breach in about 15 seconds . Are there any critical systems in its path ? Negative . Then let it go . Be ready to seal the hull breach with a force field . I 'll have a damage control team standing by for repairs . And let 's track it on sensors when it gets out . Captain , it 's penetrating the outer hull . Force field is in place . I 'm showing the energy form 100 meters off our port side . Let 's get it on screen . What was that ? It appears to be some kind of photonic lattice . And it seems pretty clear that the energy form was trying to get back to it . As though it 's ... a shelter of some kind . Or maybe a transportation device- - their equivalent of a ship . At any rate , we had sensor contact for a few seconds , and we picked up three distinct bioelectrical patterns inside it . Bioelectrical ? What are you suggesting , Captain ? We have three missing crewmen . Our best guess has been that they were somehow converted into energy while they were on the holodeck . We find no sign of them on this ship . Then we pick up three discrete patterns in that lattice , three patterns that don 't match anything else in the lattice and which have biological components . I don 't think it 's a stretch to hypothesize that those are our crew members , converted into a kind of photonic energy . But what are they doing over there ? How did they get there ? We have good evidence now that there are photonic beings that live in that protostar- - life-forms that have intelligence . We didn 't know that when we beamed those energy samples on board . We had no idea that what we were doing , in essence , was capturing those life-forms . We locked them in a containment field , and began to experiment on them . If my people were taken like that ... I know what my response would be . I would do whatever was necessary to get them back . Then you think they have simply ... retaliated against us ? Yes . These beings can manifest themselves on the holodeck in the matrix of a holo-character . That 's how they were able to take our crew members hostage . Captain , if you 're right about this , then we should return the remaining life-form . A gesture- - to show we mean well . It 's certainly worth a try . If I took the life-form onto the holodeck and release it to Grendel , maybe they 'll understand and release our people . Ordinarily , officers go through intensive training before they 're put into a First Contact situation ... but you 're the only one who can do this safely . I 'd like to finish what I started , Captain . I can do this . I agree . Make arrangements to transfer the life-form to a container , so the Doctor can carry it . But , remember ... if you 're holding the container , you 'll have to stay in solid form . I understand . Freya ? Freya ! Lord Schweitzer ! We thought the Grendel had taken you . Not ... entirely . How did you survive ? That would be difficult to explain , but that 's not important right now . This is a talisman to destroy Grendel ... You lie ! No man could survive an encounter with Grendel unless he were in league with the beast . You have brought that talisman to destroy us all . That is not true . He has returned to help us . No ! You speak his lies now . He has bewitched you . Unferth , I need to get this talisman to the hall . Then that gives me reason enough to make sure it never gets there . No ! Please ! You don 't know what you 're doing . Prepare to die , demon . Freya ... My Lord ... my time has come . Freya , I 'm sorry . There 's nothing I can do . It is a good death . Take my sword . Stop Unferth and Grendel . I won 't forget you . Then I die happily ... with your name on my lips . Farewell ... Schweitzer . Here , Sire . My Lord ... you know me as a true warrior . You know I am the one hope you have to rid your kingdom of Grendel . That talisman will aid me in my conquest . I must have it . Do not listen to him . He has already killed Freya . Stop him , my Lord ! He is a madman ! The only reason you won 't die is that I 've taken an oath to do no harm . Grendel ... I 'm ready for you . I don 't know if you can understand me- - but watch . I 'm setting this one free . There 's no need for any more of this . Please ... we ask you to return our crew . Captain , the photonic lattice has reappeared . Scan it . All sensors . I 'm reading a massive particle surge on our holodeck . The lattice is gone again . Holodeck to Bridge . Go ahead , Doctor . What is it ? We have them back , Captain- - all three of them . Good work , Doctor . Yeah . Good work . Would you mind telling me where I was ? Captain 's Log , Stardate 487 10.5 . Since the return of our missing crewmen , we 've been unable to locate any further traces of the photonic aliens . I don 't know if the being understood language or just my behavior . It would have been interesting to pursue the relationship further . It 's one of the most exciting aspects of space exploration- - meeting new species , establishing communication , sharing differences and similarities . I 'm sorry none of that happened this time . But it did . It just didn 't happen in very predictable ways . But if you think about it , we entered into conflict , communicated , and eventually established a peace treaty with them . I 'm placing a special commendation in the logs . For exemplary performance by the Chief Medical Officer during his first away mission . Thank you . I 'd like to cite you by name . Kes tells me you 've chosen one . Is that true ? I had ... but I 'm not sure I want to keep it . The last time I heard that name spoken was a ... painful one . I don 't think I want to be reminded . Sounds like you had quite an adventure on that holodeck , Doctor . Yes , I would say so . Well ... something tells me you haven 't had your last one . Something tells me the same thing .

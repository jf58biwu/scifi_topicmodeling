Humiliated in front of 10 million viewers . - We can 't hush it up this time . - This time ? It 's not the fiirst incident . Sneezing powder at government receptions , plastic spiders , and something outrageous in a diplomat 's bed . Not even the House of Lords was spared . a whoopee cushion . Taken as a vote of sanction . They 're very childish , but damaging . and you 're expecting trouble tonight . It 's an oil treaty , isn 't it ? If anything goes wrong ... What could go wrong ? - So much for the treaty . - a very poor joke . and costly . Â£ 50 million in oil concessions , foot . Who 's behind these incidents ?

I 'm collecting for charity . Do I have your support ? - Yes , 500 guineas . - Mr. Cartney ! 1000 . Your eyes are so deep . Will you dine with me ? 1000 guineas is most generous . Tomorrow ? Name the time . I 'm sorry , I 'm busy . But I 'm most grateful for you donation ... now . Very deep . You haven 't changed your mind ? I 'd reserve at the George V. We 'd catch a plane to Paris this afternoon and dine there . I am busy , but thank you ... for the donation . What charity is it ? a home for wayward girls . John ! - I thought you were alone . - Mrs. Peel , Lord Darcy . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? - John ... - Yes , of course . Will you excuse us ? Some rather dreary business . I was leaving . - Well ? - I went there . - I did everything you said . - all is ready ? Yes , ready . Willy will tell you . There was no hitch at all . Excellent . Well done , Darcy . Thank you , John . Go now . We 'll meet later . It 's going to be quite a joke , isn 't it ? Yes , quite a joke . Horace ! - How do I look ? - Lovely , sir . - Will you dine here ? - I don 't know .

How did you like Cartney ? - He gave me 1000 guineas . - Really ? - Charity donation . - Generous . Handsome . Dynamic . Compelling . Quite fascinating . We got on rather well . aside from that , did you learn anything ? No , but he 'd made a most puzzling diary entry . - What did it say ? - " Today . 4 : 30 . Friendship . " Friendship ... The Hall of Friendship , dedicated to peace . Yes ! It 's being opened today . at 4 : 30 some big wig is to cut the tape . Nowthe ceremonial scissors which his Excellency will use to cut this tape . Help ! I 've lost the picture . The aerial . The scissors were forged for the occasion , in steel from Wales ... - How much further ? - about half a mile . It 's starting . Let 's hope we 're in time . Silence falls over the Hall of Friendship as the scissors are presented . They are accepted . In a few seconds it will be over . His Excellency will cut the tape and the Hall will be open . He is moved by the solemnity of the occasion . He moves to the tape . He pauses . The speeches are over . The moment approaches . The scissors are raised ... His Excellency has fallen ! Sparks fly ! Something 's wrong ! Back to the studio . It 's no joke anymore . Mr. Darcy ! My lord ... you 're all wet . Let 's get this off . There . You 'll catch a chill . You 're soaked , sir ! Were you walking in the rain ? Were there no taxis ? Don 't worry , a cup of cocoa ... You all right , sir ? I 'll get that cocoa for you . The phone . - Hello . - John ... It 's Darcy . I must see you . I can 't , I 'm rather busy . I must ! I 've told you I 'm busy . I 'm afraid it can 't wait .

We met at a very boring party given by Lady ... Her corgies ravaged some fellow 's plum trees while he played the flute to chase the bees from his asparagus . - Yes , I think ... - Of course . Forgive me , but ... you don 't look up to par . What have you been up to ? I 'm looking for Mr. Cartney . He isn 't here . I 'll tell him you called . I 'd rather wait . He 's too busy to see you . I 'm expected . Mrs. Peel ! - This is a surprise ! - Half expecting . - This is Miss Bradley . - How do you do ? - If you 're busy ... - Not at all . No reason you shouldn 't stay . It might amuse you . It 's a club I formed . We 're meeting tonight . What sort of club ? Slightly unusual . Why don 't you come see ? I ought not to tell this . We 're old friends , aren 't we ? It was a joke . Rubber scissors . Just a joke . You were to exchange the scissors . No , that was Willy 's job . I just got him in there . - How did you manage ? - My uncle was on the committee . I pinched his keys . My job was to let Willy in . It was just a joke , that 's all . I didn 't want to kill anyone . Why did you play the joke anyway ? What was the idea ? Darcy ! - Why did you play the joke ? - I had to . Everyone has to . It 's a rule of the club . What club ? The Hellfiire Club . Hellfiire ... Gentlemen ! Hellfiire ! Hellfiire ! May it scorch and singe ! Burn and broil ! Seethe and scald ! Combust and crackle ! Until we are enflamed . - Roasted . - Toasted . Grilled . and cauterized . Until our bones crumble into the demonic heat , that Hades , that realm of Pluto ... that unblessed limbo ... that purgatory ... that pit ... that thanatos . Gentlemen ! Hellfiire ! Hellfiire ! Let the wenching begin ! Cartney , what have you there ? a new wench for us ? This is my guest of honour . My lords Cardigan , Ragsland and Lincoln . Madame , I pledge this blade to thee . - Pray thee , sit down . - Sit down . Willy , what manners ! Would you care to teach him better ? Willy 's our champion . Sabres , swords , pistols . He 's come through many a duel . - Haven 't you ? - Pray , sit down . You 're too kind . - I 'm an awful nuisance . - Not at all . You 'd do the same for me . You 'd never need it . You don 't make an ass of yourself . Get some rest . Do you think I had a hand in the murder ? I think you were duped . You know ... talking to you has helped me . I know what I have to do . - I 'm grateful . - We 'll talk later . First I 'll give you my patent hangover cure . I call it " National anthem " . It 'll get you on your feet . One dose of this ... I try to recreate the original Hellfiire Club . Its atmosphere , excitement , and its pleasures , of course . a man lived by his sword , his wit , and his birthright . and women ? Vessels of pleasure . I see . Do you disapprove ? Cartney ! Cartney ! - I want to see you . - See me then ! You used me . You planned the whole thing . The scissors were an excuse ! - Shut up ! - I will not shut up . - I want to talk . - all right . But at the proper time . I 'll call a meeting . Now . I call a meeting of the superior members . Excuse me . Do you realize what it means to challenge the superiors ? Superiors ! Nonsense ! Enter the Circle of Justice . all right ... But if you think ... The assembly of superiors is present . Complainant , state your name . You know my name . Will you please state your name ? Look , I 'm not playing anymore silly games . I just want an explanation . Why you , Cartney ... and the rest plotted a murder ? a fiilthy murder ! Involving me ! Well ? Why ? I just thought you 'd like to explain before I go to the police . Well ? Why ? all right .

On the surface , dressing up , play acting . - Underneath ... - When can I join ? Right now , perhaps . Mrs. Peel ... - Paying his last respects . - You knew Lord Darcy ? a little . - Tragic accident . - Yes . We warned him , but in vain . Bad timing too . He 'd been telling me about your club .

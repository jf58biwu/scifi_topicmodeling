COHN , BUT I COULDN 'T LEAVE IT ALONE- - NOT WHILE MICHEL 'S KILLER WAS STILL OUT THERE- - NOT IF I WANTED TO LIVE WITH MYSELF . I KNEW SKUR HAD KILLED MICHEL OUT OF VENGEANCE FOR WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO HIM . YOUR FATHER HAD TOLD ME AS MUCH . BUT YOUR FATHER ALSO SAID THERE WERE TWO OTHER MEN WHO HAD HAD THE SAME THING DONE TO THEM- - MEN WHO WERE ALREADY DEAD . FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT LEAST MIGHT HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT SKUR HAD BECOME , UNDERSTAND HOW MY PARTNER WAS KILLED . - WHAT IS THIS ? - THE DEPOSITION THAT NAMES EDWARD SKUR ... AND THESE OTHER TWO MEN AS COMMUNISTS . IT 'S ALL CENSORED . BY THE COMMITTEE , TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF THE WITNESS . THERE WAS NO WITNESS . THIS WHOLE THING 'S BEEN MANUFACTURED . EDWARD SKUR IS NO COMMUNIST . NEITHER ARE THESE OTHER TWO MEN , GISSING AND OBERMAN . I WANNA SEE THEIR FILES- - GISSING AND OBERMAN . I ALREADY CHECKED . THEY 'RE MISSING , BUT I RECOGNIZE ONE OF THESE NAMES . - IT 'S IN AN X-FILE . - AN " X-FILE " ? YES , UNSOLVED CASES . I FILE THEM UNDER " X. " WHY DON 'T YOU FILE THEM UNDER " U " FOR " UNSOLVED " ? THAT 'S WHAT I DID UNTIL I RAN OUT OF ROOM . PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE X 's . WHO DECIDES WHEN A CASE GETS AN " X " ? THE DIRECTOR 'S OFFICE . IT 'S , UH- - IT 'S KIND OF A DEAD END . NO ONE 'S SUPPOSED TO SEE THEM , BUT IT MAKES FOR INTERESTING READING . HERE IT IS . A GERMAN EMIGRE , DR. STROHMAN , PATRIATED HERE AFTER THE WAR . HE WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS OFFICE LAST WEEK AT THE V.A. LET ME GUESS . THEY WEREN 'T ABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW HIS BODY JUST KINDA COLLAPSED . RIGHT ? YES . GISSING- - HIS NAME 'S IN THIS FILE SOMEWHERE ? YES . HE WAS A PATIENT , FOUND DEAD ON THE SCENE- - SUICIDE . I GUESS HE DIDN 'T MUCH CARE FOR HIS TREATMENT . THEY THINK HE KILLED HIS DOCTOR AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF ? HOW DID GISSING KILL THIS MAN ? THAT 'S WHY IT 'S AN X-FILE . THEY DON 'T KNOW . DR. GISSING 'S BODY 'S STILL HERE . THE V.A. ' S BEEN TRYING TO HAVE IT TRANSFERRED . WHY HAVEN 'T THEY ? THIS FELLOW 'S A BIGWIG IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT . HIS FAMILY 'S BEEN KICKING UP A STINK . - WHAT IS THIS ? - UH , LOOKS LIKE HE HAD SOME SURGERY . JUDGING BY THE COLOR OF THE SCAR , I 'D SAY IT WAS FAIRLY RECENT . I WANT YOU TO CUT THIS MAN OPEN . NO , I-I CAN 'T DO THAT . HIS FAMILY WILL HAVE MY HEAD . GISSING AND A MAN NAMED SKUR WERE PATIENTS OF THE SAME DOCTORS . I THINK WHATEVER WAS DONE TO THIS MAN WAS ALSO DONE TO THE MAN WHO KILLED MY PARTNER . IT MAY BE THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW HE DIED . WHAT 'S THAT ? WHAT IS THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . IT LOOKS LIKE IT 'S LODGED INTO HIS ESOPHAGUS . WAIT A MINUTE . THOSE ARE SUTURES . WHATEVER THIS IS , SOMEONE PUT IT THERE . - OH , JEEZ . - WHOA ! OH , MY GOD . MRS. SKUR , I HOPE I 'M NOT DISTURBING YOU . YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE COMING HERE . YOUR HUSBAND- - YOU KNOW HE 'S NOT DEAD . HOW DARE YOU . YOUR HUSBAND WAS DISCREDITED IN ORDER TO COVER UP A CRIME- - A CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED UPON HIM , AGAINST HIS WILL . WHATEVER WAS DONE TO MY HUSBAND , YOU 'RE A PART OF IT . ACCORDING TO V.A. RECORDS , YOUR HUSBAND UNDERWENT SURGERY FOR WAR INJURIES . SO DID TWO OTHER MEN HE WORKED WITH AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT . BUT THE SURGERIES THAT THEY RECEIVED- - IT WASN 'T WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS . IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR WAR INJURIES . - THEN WHAT WAS IT ? - IT 'S CALLED XENOTRANSPLANTATION . IT 'S , UH , THE GRAFTING OF ANOTHER SPECIES INTO THE HUMAN BODY . IT 'S A PROCEDURE THAT NAZI DOCTORS EXPERIMENTED WITH DURING THE WAR , AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY CONTINUED THEIR WORK HERE , USING YOUR HUSBAND AND THESE OTHER TWO MEN AS UNWITTING TEST SUBJECTS . I WANT TO EXPOSE WHAT WAS DONE TO YOUR HUSBAND , MRS. SKUR . I CAN 'T DO THAT UNLESS I HAVE HIS HELP . GET IN . JUST GET IN . [ Dog Barking ] ED ? OH , GOD . ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? - I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME DOWN HERE . - THAT F.B.I. AGENT CAME BACK . [ Panting , Gagging ] I 'M GETTING WORSE . HE SAYS HE WANTS TO HELP YOU . IT 'S TOO LATE TO HELP ME . - NO . - I CAN 'T HELP MYSELF ANYMORE . [ Gagging ] [ Mrs. Skur Screaming ] YOU SIT THERE . LEAVE US ALONE . - MR. DIRECTOR- - - LEAVE US . [ Door Opens , Closes ] IN 1945 , AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST CONFERENCE ... TO MAP OUT THE PEACE AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR , THERE LIVED WITHIN THE SOVIET ORBIT 180 MILLION PEOPLE . LINED UP ON THE ANTITOTALITARIAN SIDE AT THAT TIME ... WERE 1,625,000,000 PEOPLE . TODAY , MR. DALES , JUST SEVEN YEARS LATER , THERE ARE 800 MILLION PEOPLE ... UNDER THE ABSOLUTE DOMINATION OF SOVIET RUSSIA- - AN INCREASE OF OVER 400 % . ON OUR SIDE , THE FIGURE HAS SHRUNK TO AROUND 500 MILLION . IN OTHER WORDS , IN LESS THAN SEVEN YEARS ... THE ODDS HAVE CHANGED FROM NINE-TO-ONE IN OUR FAVOR ... TO EIGHT-TO-FIVE AGAINST US . THE THREAT OF GLOBAL COMMUNIST DOMINATION ... IS A REALITY THAT CAN BE IGNORED ... ONLY AT THE RISK OF OUR OWN ANNIHILATION . THE MEN WE ARRESTED WEREN 'T COMMUNISTS . IF WE ARE TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY , WE MUST USE THEIR TOOLS . WE MUST GO FURTHER ! WE MUST DO THOSE THINGS WHICH EVEN OUR ENEMIES WOULD BE ASHAMED TO DO . IT IS ONLY THROUGH STRENGTH ... THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR ENEMIES FEAR US ... AND THEREBY ENSURE OUR OWN SURVIVAL . YOU HAVE ONE CHANCE , MR. DALES , TO SAVE YOURSELF , TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH ... TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY . MAKE YOUR MEETING WITH SKUR . LET HIM THINK YOU 'RE ALONE . PUT HIM AT EASE . WE 'LL BE IN WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT . WAS THIS WHY YOU CAME TO SEE ME , MR. MULDER- - MAKE ME YOUR STALKING-HORSE ? I FOLLOW MY ORDERS . - I MIGHT NEED THAT . - WE WANT HIM ALIVE . THERE YA GO . I TURNED THE LIGHTS OFF OUT FRONT . JUST PULL THE DOOR SHUT WHEN YOU GO . OKAY . THANKS FOR YOUR HELP . ANYTHING TO HELP OUT THE BUREAU . DID YOU COME HERE TO KILL ME , OR TO SAVE ME ? I 'M HERE TO HELP YOU , JUST LIKE I TOLD YOUR WIFE . MY WIFE IS DEAD . I 'M DEAD TOO , INSIDE , BECAUSE OF THIS THING THEY PUT IN ME . FOR WHAT- - TO TURN ME INTO SOME KIND OF KILLING MACHINE , OR JUST TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN ? THEY 'RE NOT COMING , YOU KNOW . THEY WANTED ME TO KILL YOU , OR YOU WOULDN 'T BE HERE . YOU 'RE PART OF THEIR TEST NOW TOO . I DON 'T WANT TO KILL YOU . I KNOW . MULDER . [ Sounds Of Struggle Continue Over Speaker ] [ Grunting ] [ Gagging ] [ Dale Panting ] [ Struggle Continues , Ends ] I CAN 'T BELIEVE MY FATHER THREW IN WITH THESE MEN . [ Sighs ] HE LET THEM DICTATE HIS CONSCIENCE . OH , DON 'T FOOL YOURSELF . NONE OF US ARE FREE TO CHOOSE . I WAS RUINED FOR MY INSUBORDINATION . YOU KEEP DIGGING THROUGH THE X-FILES , AND THEY 'LL BURY YOU TOO . SKUR DIED SAYING MY FATHER 'S NAME . WHY ? I HAVEN 'T THE FAINTEST IDEA . THERE WAS , UH- - THERE 'S ONE THING YOU DIDN 'T EXPLAIN . IT WAS ... HOW SKUR WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY ; HOW HE WAS ABLE TO LIVE IN OBSCURITY FOR THE LAST 38 YEARS . THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS ? MY GOD . WELL , I KEPT HEARING THINGS THROUGH THE YEARS , YOU KNOW . PEOPLE TELL ME THINGS . I HEARD THAT HE WAS DEAD , THAT HE WAS KEPT IN SOME SECRET LAB WHILE THEY FINISHED UP THE EXPERIMENT . [ Chuckling ] I EVEN THOUGHT THAT MAYBE- - MAYBE SOME POOR , INNOCENT BASTARD- - SOMEBODY WITH A CONSCIENCE- - MIGHT HAVE LET HIM GO . [ Mulder ] WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT ? WHY LET A KILLER GO FREE ? [ Dales ] IN THE HOPE THAT BY LETTING HIM LIVE , THE TRUTH OF THE CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED ... AGAINST HIM AND THE OTHERS ... MIGHT SOMEDAY BE EXPOSED . [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

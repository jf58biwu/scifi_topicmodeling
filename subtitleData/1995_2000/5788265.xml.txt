 [ female ] Listen up , ' cause I 'm only tellin ' you this once . I 'm not a bedtime story lady , so pay attention . It 's 2033 . The world is screwed now . You see , a while ago , this humongous comet came crashing into the Earth . Bam ! Total devastation . End of the world as we know it . No celebrities , no cable TV , no water . It hasn 't rained in 11 years . Now , 20 people gotta squeeze inside the same bathtub . So , it ain 't all bad . [ brays ] That 's me ... the one in the mask . No , the other one in the mask . Today 's my boyfriend 's birthday . So , I 'm out shopping for that perfect gift ... whatever I can scrounge up . Uh-oh , Ripper leftovers . [ whistles ] [ brays ] The Rippers are a demonic army of bloodthirsty , human eating , purse snatching , mutant creatures . Witness exhibit A. Uchh ! , you are so dead . They 're led by the infamous Johnny Prophet . They spend most of their time raiding ' the WP . That 's short for Water and Power . They control most of the water and got all the power . Oh , wait , one last thing . My friends and me , we do not suck up to Water and Power . Yeah , we steal water , but as long as they don 't find out , who gives a shit ? Ah , there it is ... home sweet home . A thing of beauty . I 'm gonna go water the vegetables . Hey , Town , you fixed the pump , right ? I 'm going down . [ male ] Yeah , go for it . [ water gurgling ] Shit . [ Russian accent ] You 've been stealing water . What gave you that idea ? Take off your clothes . Ohh , agh ! [ cocks gun ] - Now ! - Shit . Right , right , right , right ... There . Did I tell you to stop ? Ohh . Now ... Salute me . I 'm not too good under pressure . Well , you 'll learn then , won 't you ? Gross out . Come on , they 're being weird again . Let 's get outta here . Let go . Damn ! Hah , I was just gettin into that one . Give me that . [ laughing ] Hey , Sam . I thought you was working on my Doris Day bust . I didn 't trade you my specially autographed Doris picture just for whatever this is . I know , but the wood talks to me . It said , " Ripper . " [ chuckles ] How would you know what one looks like ? No one 's ever seen a Ripper . No one 's ever seen your peanut dick either . - I 'm tellin ' . - Go ahead . [ male ] Rebecca , don 't forget guard duty . [ glasses jingle ] [ Kesslee ] Ah . Adam was dust until God injected him with life . And do you know what was in that injection ? Water . Water is life . Water is power . Well done . You 've all done a masterful job . Ninety-five percent of the desert and all the water it contains now belongs to Water and Power . Well , I think that deserves a little toast . To Captain Derouche for securing most of the desert . [ chuckles ] Captain Derouche . [ clink ] [ all ] Captain Derouche . I can promise you , sir , the Rippers will only be a minor setback . Hmm . Once I take care of them , that final crack of land will be ours . This crack of land , Captain ? Hm , hm , well , just a small crack . Doesn 't matter , we 'll let that go . Hmm . [ crash ] Oh , my . Now look what 's happened . We lost the Feta Plains . [ crash ] And the Tenelson Ridge . [ crash ] And so on ! [ shattering ] There are three million liters of water underneath the Blue Dunes . And you will retrieve it . Do I make myself clear , gentlemen ? [ all ] Yes , sir . Good ! Remove your boots , Captain . Now , come here . The fool . It was foolish not to carry out my order . And it was foolish to walk across a floor full of glass . If I were you , I wouldn 't have done it . I would have killed me first . But you lack that courage , don 't you , Captain ? [ whispers ] Come closer . Well . [ chuckles ] Uh ! Ah . [ chuckles ] Sergeant Small , it 's your show now . Please , try not to let me down . [ Sergeant Small ] Yes , sir . Lovely . [ female ] I take guard duty very seriously . [ singing ] Elvis , Elvis , come out and play . Hey , baby , what do you say , me and you , Vegas ? Bollocks ! Boo ! Rebecca ? Rebecca ? Rebecca ? Rebecca ? Rebecca ! Ha ha , got you . [ chuckles ] You butt smear . What 'd I tell you ? Don 't say butt smear . It 's not becoming . Say ... asshole . Or dickwad . - Trade you . - What ? I 'll sneak you some food for that danger ball you found . I don 't know . You know how to work it ? - Mm-hm . - If you don 't ... [ clank ] you 're steak tartare . [ click ] All right . First , go get me my food . [ clicking ] Happy birthday . [ giggles ] I knew you couldn 't resist me . Snip snip . Don 't come any closer . You gotta stay there . And watch . Okay , you can come a little bit closer . But you can 't touch . [ cocking ] [ beeping ] Hi . Lose the scissors . Shit . [ men 's voices ] Water and Power , hands in the air ! [ machine gun fire ] [ clamoring ] [ female ] Over here , over here ! [ male ] It 's the troopers . Confirmed , they 've been siphoning water . Well , keep going .

[ yelling ] No ! Richard ! [ machine gun firing ] [ yells ] Come on ! [ clamoring ] Shit ! We got her ! [ cocking ] You 've been stealing water . - Not smart . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . We could have a lot of fun with this one . [ mooing ] [ trooper ] Well , well . Don 't you know you shouldn 't own animals ? [ howling ] There 's a water shortage . There 's your water . Uh ! Hey , you . Look at me when I 'm talkin ' to ya . That cut looks painful . I like pain . And what else do you like ? Hot oil . Vacuum attachments . Yeah ? Yep . Hey , which of you gorgeous guys would like an oil change , hm ? [ chuckling ] Don 't be stupid , she 's gonna bite it off . The moment I feel teeth , you feel lead . [ zipping ] Well , what are you waiting for ? I 'm gonna need a microscope and tweezers . It 's like , uh ... You know , you 're gonna have to stop this . You 're really gettin ' me hot . [ crunch ] [ cocking ] Freeze ! What ? [ water running ] [ birds chirping ] Ah , ah . She 's all yours , sir . Just how many of my men did you kill ? Mm-mm . [ clears throat ] Eight , sir . Eight , eight , the burning eight . Between Sunday and Monday hangs a day so dark , it will devastate . Excuse me . Hey . Abandon all hope , ye who enter here . Look , you want to torture me , spank me , lick me ? Do it . But if this poetry shit continues , just shoot me now please ? [ laughs ] What , and waste all that talent ? I 'm offering you the chance of a lifetime . The honor of working for me . [ whispers ] Not interested . [ whispers ] Not yet . Put her to work . [ male ] Dig or die ! You people are pathetic ! [ male # 2 ] Come on , get back to work ! [ male # 3 ] These water pipes should have been dug yesterday ! Hey , just stand still . Hey , this scum 's got a knife . [ clamoring ] [ male ] Enjoying yourself ? Uh ! Hey , what time is it ? I don 't want to miss Bay Watch . [ yells ] Hey , Jess , how 's the jet , Jet ? I asked you a question ! There are stress cracks in the main engine turbine blades . And the manifold pressure sensor 's leaking like a sieve . I 'm doing a full teardown . I 'll have her back together by Wednesday . You 'll have her back together by morning . I don 't care if you have to work all night . That is , of course , unless you want to make me change my mind . Uh ! I 'll have it fixed by morning . [ female voice ] Failure to recycle body fluids is a violation . Number four ... Hoarding water rations is a violation . Number five ... syphoning body fluids from another prisoner is a violation . Number six ... Tampering with no smoking devices is a violation . [ violations continue ] [ yelling ] [ male ] What is your problem ? I have gone out of my way to be nice to you ! If it wasn 't for me , you would just be another whore around here . Now , all I 'm askin ' for is just a little bit in return . Quit picking ' on my girlfriend . Uh . Shit . Uh , God , that is ... [ spits ] Thanks . It worked . What worked ? Mm , oh , my God . [ giggles ] [ female voice ] End of shift . All prisoners return to cells . End of shift . All prisoners return to cells . [ clamoring ] [ buzzer sounds ] Ahh ! Heh , heh , heh . [ Rebecca ] I 'm in love . Ba-ba-ba-bam . Cool . [ computer voice ] Systems check , stand by . Check , check , check , check , check . Please enter security signature . My mom and your mom were hangin ' out clothes . - Security signature invalid . - Shit . You have ten seconds before cyanide gas is injected into the chamber . - Go , go ! - Ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . Oh , no . You know the security code to this thing ? Yeah , yeah . Good , then get me outta here . Go , do it . Get to cranking . They 're hijacking a tank . Sir , if you want my opinion ... No , I don 't . Places to wreck , people to do . [ stuttering ] This tank , it isn 't ... isn 't , isn 't ... - isn 't ... - What ? Come on , just one little adjective , we 'll have a whole sentence here . The tank isn 't ... Glad . Sad . Mad . - Um ... - Lonely . [ sighs ] It isn 't op ... op ... operational . How do I know you 're not lyin ' ? Because , if I was lying , your lungs would be full of cyanide gas . Cool , so we get a new tank . Wait , wait . Look , um , nobody gets out of here without a clearance . We 're all prisoners here . And if ... if they catch you ... Then they 'll , don 't tell me , they 'll take away my TV privileges . I 'll live with it . My , my . She 'll be fun to break . - [ gasps ] - How 's your lover ? Huh ? Yeah , I wouldn 't get too attached . She 's not going to be around much longer . Well , I bet you just can 't wait to take this baby for a test run , huh ? That 's too bad . 'Cause you just lost your flying privileges . And , uh , the whole hangar is off limits too . You happy ? [ frustrated yelp ] [ crying ] Miss me ? What ... what are you doing ? Oh , I was just thinking about leaving this place . It 's been swell , but the swelling 's gone down . What do you reckon ? We go to New York , see Cats . You ... you don 't understand . The ... the better you behave , the more they leave you alone . And the more they leave you alone , the better off you are . Well , that 's a bore . There 's nuttin ' to be scared of . You just gotta think about it like the first time you got laid . You just gotta go , " Daddy , are you sure this is right ? " Oh , you 're sick . How come you always do that ? How come you always cover your mouth when you smile ? You got bad teeth or somethin ' ? - Mm , I don 't know . - Come on . What do you say we bolt ? [ clunk ] Oh ! You know , I 'm really startin to like it here . People are nice , food 's great , and I love my job . I can see why you want to hang around . [ door closes ] Morning . It 's really hard for me to play with myself in this thing . That 's a shame . [ chuckles ] Look , you want to play , I 'll play . And I 'll win . No , not if it 's Monopoly , 'cause I really kick ass at that game . But , I get to be the shoe . I 'm going to ask you just one more time . Do you want to work for Water and Power ? Oh , yeah , that sounds groovy . I get to wear a cute little outfit like yours ? [ clang ] [ chuckles ] The pipe . You 're gonna really love this one . Goes down 40 meters . [ clanging ] You 'll get smaller and smaller the deeper you go . Sounds wicked . Can I go first ? [ chuckles ] I hope you 're not claustrophobic . Drop her . Uh ! Bye . [ clang ] [ gasping ] No ! No ! Don 't go . Help ! Rebecca ! [ click ] Full metal . They didn 't even have a chance to squeeze off a round . [ Kesslee ] Another outpost lost to those Rippers . At this rate , we 'll lose all our water . Rippers must have come up from some underground sub gate . Well then , I know just the young lady to help us find it . Absolutely , sir . Uhh . Hmm , well , I 'm so glad you see things my way now . You know what I see ? No . What ? This big honkin ' booger hangin ' outta your left nostril . If I was you , I 'd use this finger to pick it out . [ bonk ] Uhh . [ chuckles ] I win . Yeah . [ chuckles ] Lucky you . And just wait till you see what you 've won . - Excuse me . [ bang ] - Ow ! Relax , it 's only a locator . [ chuckles ] This is your pulse . [ beeping ] Now I 'll always be close to your heart . [ exhales ] Your job is to penetrate this sub gate we found , which could be the entrance to the Ripper 's base . Most of these are booby-trapped , so if we hear a loud bang ... Sorry . If not , congratulations , you just found the Ripper 's hideout . [ chuckles ] Either way , I win . Like a piece of cheese at the end of a fishing hook . That 's you . Ready . - Move . - Uh ! [ commotion and firing ] [ male ] Rippers ! Arrgh ! Condor Control , Condor zero five , I 'm detecting Ripper activity . [ yelling ] Wha ? [ snarling ] Oh , my God . [ growls ] That 's what you get for messin ' with me . Mine . [ beeping ] Well , what do you know ? Am I close to your heart now , Kesslee ? What happened to the rest of you ? Butthead . Cool . Shit . Don 't shoot , don 't shoot ! I thought the Rippers got you . Hell , no . Come on , let 's go . I ain 't goin ' back there . Your gonna have to kill me first . No , I 'm not . 'Cause I 'm not gonna go back there either . We 're free . [ laughs ] [ ominous sounds ] Oh , no . We better go before they come back for us . You take the tank . Are you sure ? Go , go , all right . Rebecca ! Don 't leave . No ! Rebecca , come on ! Rebecca , turn the engine off ! Kill the engine ! You 're crazy ! [ bonk ] Are you okay ? [ echoes ] Sorry about the bonker on the head . I think I need to go practice some more . - No ! - Yes . [ knocking ] Take that ! - No , no ! - Yes . [ clamoring , rustling ] - Heeya ! You didn 't have to rough me up so bad , Becky . Hmm . Look , no hands . [ giggling ] You could do that for a living . Look out ! [ female ] You 're face has been gutted , Mr. Kesslee , sir . To be honest , your chances of seeing again are as likely as your arm growing back . However , I can make you comfortable . No ! [ syringe shatters ] No pain killers . Do I make myself clear , Doctor ? Yes , sir . Good . Now , what is the prognosis ? Not good , sir . [ Kesslee ] Not good . [ clears throat ] Excuse me . - Sir , this is Mr. Che 'tsai . - What ? What ? He ... uh , Che 'tsai . He , uh , specializes in cybergenic reconstructive surgery . - Oh . - Go ahead . [ speaking Chinese ] [ electronic voice ] All the king 's horses and all the king 's men wish they had the technology I have . [ Chinese continues ] [ electronic voice ] If you want my services ... the fee will be 100,000 liters . Doctor , come here . You see the glass half empty . I prefer to see it half full . - [ Kesslee ] Don 't you agree , Sergeant ? - [ Doctor ] I don 't understand . Uh ! [ Jet Girl ] We can 't be in here . We 're trespassing . What if somebody catches us ? Jet , there she blow , matey . Do - do-do , do-do-do . Put it down , it 's not funny . What is it ? [ cocking ] Raise your hands to the sky gods . The rains are coming . But it hasn 't rained since the comet . I need metal to complete my ark . I 'll be taking your tank . No , see , you won 't be taking the tank . The Rippers are waiting . I must save them from the floods . Tell me the security code . Bam ! - Ha ha . - Oh ! All right , listen , rain lady , where 'd you get this ? I made it . - [ electronic voice ] Liar . - She 's lying . How do you know ? Well , it 's a little something I designed . It 's a spectrum analyzer which recognizes voice pattern stress modulations . It detects lies . But I only speak the truth . [ electronic voice ] Liar . All right , all right , I , uh , I caught it in my fish pond on a stick . Liar . All right , all right , all right , all right . They were selling a girl 's stuff after they had taken her prisoner . I bought it . It was sad , really . What 'd they do with the girl ? First , tell me what Water and Power want with her . We 're not Water and Power . We 're escaped prisoners . Oh , in that case . Oh , it was terrible . They put her to work in town at Liquid Silver . Come on , Jet , we gotta go get her . To the bat tank . Wait , wait , we can 't go into town with those Water and Power vehicles . Oh , oh , oh , you can fix them up here in my garage . [ whistles ] [ whistles ] Ha ha . Da - da-da-da-da ... [ whistles ] Pow ! Yes . Ba-ba-ba-pow ! Hey , Jet . Nice work . They took the bait , sir , and they 're on their way to Liquid Silver for the girl . Make sure I get the girl first , Sergeant . Yes , sir . [ speaking Chinese ] I 'm outta here . [ cracking ] [ mixed voices ] What you got there , little boy ? No , I don 't need none of that today , thank you . [ Rebecca ] Nice hats .

Yeah , I was thinkin ' that , right ? But then , I was also thinkin ' that if they are Water and Power , No , no , no , don 't you . why would they come here advertising it ? - [ giggling ] - Check it out . Tattoos . Give me that . I wonder where else they got ' em . I don 't think those are tattoos . I mean , like , who would want some alphabet soup ? I 'd rather have a dragon or some ... somethin ' more Aquarian related , you dig ? They 're prisoner stamps . - [ Rebecca ] Mine . - Prisoner , my ass . That 's exactly what they want us to think . Or better yet , that isn 't what they want us to think . That way , we 'll think what they think we might think . But actually ... - [ male ] Booga . - Huh ? Try not to speak . How much did they pay you to spy on us ? $ 2.15 . [ male ] Shut up ! [ male # 2 ] You should go easy on the truth serum . It might send ' em off . Hey . On second thought , that could be to our advantage . That 's good , I 'm tired of asking them questions anyway . - I say we kill ' em . - I say we hump ' em . I say we get crumpets and tea . Tasty . Crumpets and tea . All in favor of crumpets and tea , say " aye . " [ all ] Aye . Shut up ! Ain 't gonna be no crumpets and tea . We 're gonna take ' em outside right now and waste ' em .

[ Rebecca ] Hey , no cheating . Ready , one , two ... [ giggling ] [ Jet Girl ] I 've got you . - Hi . - Hi . Do you suppose me and Jet could go to the bathroom ? Uh , it 's totally negatory . - Hi . - Hi . You know , me and Jet can make it worth your while . Put a little smile on that kangaroo face . You got baseball cards ? [ chuckles ] Oh , but ... no . But , um , I ... I know where I could get you some . She does . It 's totally negatory . No , wait , wait , wait , uh , uh ... come on . Now , you don 't want to be like those other manimals in there . [ chuckles ] We 're not manimals . What are you ? The army wanted to build the ultimate soldier , so they messed with , uh , kangaroo NDA and ... You mean DNA . Yeah . And they created us . And then the war ended and they told Johnny to poison us . Johnny Prophet ? Yeah . Why ? Because he was the one that made us . But then he didn 't do it because he decided that he liked us too much . I have this great idea . You , me , and Jet go for a visit with Johnny Prophet . Well , when he get 's back , yeah . Uh , well , maybe . Where did he go ? To , uh , uh , New Zealand for a little while to , uh , help some scientist guy who 's makin ' sea water so you could drink it . Does she need to know that ? Did they need to know that ? - Uh , I was just ... - Get your ass outta here ! Uh ! [ mixed voices ] [ male on radio ] Go ahead WP-2 . Hey , you guys , hey ! We have a shipment coming tonight from Red Sands , over . Water and Power 's gettin ' some kind of shipment in . What kind of shipment ? I don 't know , all I know it 's coming in from Red Sands . - When ? - Tonight . What if it 's a arms shipment ? It 's a trap . What if they want us to think it 's a trap , but it 's really not ? That way , when we get there , it could still be one . [ gasps ] Or better yet , what if ... - Booga ! - Huh ? Why don 't you make yourself useful and go and choke on something . [ grumbling ] [ male ] Oh , that 's cold , man . [ clunk ] Okay , we 're gonna give you chicks a chance to prove yourself . Call it an initiation . You fail , you die . Yeah , but first you gotta strip . That 's not in the plan . [ all ] Why not ? [ Rebecca ] Ha ha ha . [ Rebecca humming ] Hold on , cats . All right . All you have to do is confirm the shipment . Copacetic ? You 're gonna use this . But you have to be really careful with it . - [ Rebecca ] Let me see . - Because I designed it with a ... I , uh ... I especially built it with a visual send processor . It 's a little invention that I invented myself , I might add . - [ chuckles ] - Smile . Oh , and these are so you can hear us . This one 's for you . And this one I made especially for you . - Hmm . - Let me help you put it on because it 's kind of tricky to ... Oh , I 'm sorry , how clumsy of me . - Ohh . - What ? - [ Jet Girl ] Get off . - It was hard to clip on . Whaa ... Okay , so , we can hear you . But how are you gonna hear us ? Just speak facing ' West . We 'll hear you all right . The code will be , " On the road . " Yeah . He 's Jack Kerouac incarnated . Uh , we ... we 're all reincarnated .

Come on , okay , yes , yes , yes , I like that . Those are definitely weapons in those crates . We better move . No way , the whole thing is so convenient , man .

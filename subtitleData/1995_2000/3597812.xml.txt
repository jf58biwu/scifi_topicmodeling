 [ Engine trying to turn over ] You 're flooding it , booger . - [ Grunts ] - [ Engine backfires ] [ Coughing ] For god 's sake , Izzy . [ Continues coughing ] [ engine idling ] Here she comes . Let 's go . Come on , man . Come on . - You gotta be kiddin ' . - What ? Don 't " what " me , Izzy , or you ain 't goin ' to no comic book convention . I 'm 18 . I can go anywhere I want . Yeah , but where you gonna live when you get back ? Mom , we gotta get going . [ Engine idling roughly ] you drive careful , booger . He 's the only son I 've got . Okay , miss b . [ TV : Jerry Springer ] I 'm about to introduce you to a woman ... Who three years ago was delivered the surprise of her life . After nine months of what seemed like a normal pregnancy , Doctors delivered to Delores a very special child . A mother of two beautiful children , Delores held in her arms a boy with fur like a dog ... And a hairline like Eddie Munster . She 's here with us today with her real-Live , but sleeping wolf baby . Why not just give him a razor and some shaving cream ? He 's gonna be shaving in a couple of years anyway . [ Delores ] actually , he seems to be quite allergic to shaving cream . [ Springer ] so they don 't tease him ? [ Delores ] no , he 's quite popular . Is dandruff a problem ? No , I wash his hair twice a day , and brush a hundred strokes at night . I can 't believe this . [ Springer ] good for you . I think the question the audience really wants answered is- - [ TV continues , indistinct ] [ Sizzling ] ? ? [ Cher ] ? Loneliness ? Hello ? ? Is the cloak you wear ? Who 's there ? ? Deep shade of blue ? ? Is always there ? ? The sun ain 't gonna shine anymore ? [ Coughing ] ? The moon ain 't gonna rise in the sky ? [ Gasps ] ? The tears are always clouding your eyes ? ? When you 're without love ? [ Scully ] " dear special agent Mulder , I 'm writing to you for help . " Several years ago , I had an experience I could not explain . " I was lying in my bed when I felt a presence in the room . " Though I was awake , I felt something had taken control over my body . " I don 't remember much else , but I woke up three days later pregnant with my son , Izzy . " That was 18 years ago , but now it happened again . " I was in bed and could swear I heard Cher singing , " The one who was married to sonny . " Then the room got all smoky ... " And I saw some kind of monster . " He had a really gross face with lumps all over his head . " I was too scared to scream . " Then I got all groggy and conked out for three days . " Guess what happened when I woke up ? " I got your name off the TV . " Some lady on the Jerry Springer show , who had a werewolf baby , " Said you came to her house . " Well , I got her story beat by a mile . So maybe you 'll want to come see me too . Sincerely , Shaineh Berkowitz . " Scully , do you think it 's too soon to get my own 1-900 number ? So , did you actually see that werewolf baby or was that just a story ? No , it had something called hypertrichosis lanuginosa . It 's a rare hereditary condition most commonly found in some south American families . Uh-Huh . But he was all hairy and stuff ? Uh , Mrs. Berkowitz , you said that you also had a son ? Mm-Hmm . Izzy . That 's him there . [ Scully ] and Izzy is the product ... Of your union with some kind of intruder ? I don 't know about no union , but I woke up in a condition . - Did you report this to the police ? - Of course I did . [ Scully ] was there an investigation ? Not really . Nobody here ever locks their doors . And it took me a month or two to figure out that I was pregnant . Now you 're pregnant again ? [ Shaineh ] uh-Huh . But as I told agent Mulder on the phone , that 's what takes the cake . Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation two years ago . You can 't plant a seed in a barren field . They were cooking something on the range . Took me two days of scrubbing to clean the skillet . I don 't know how many of them there were . I only saw the one , but they ate almost a whole damn jar of peanut butter . You said you were gone for three days , but nobody missed you . - I know what you 're thinkin ' . - Do you drink , Mrs. Berkowitz ? No , but I 'm not so sure my intruders , as you call them , didn 't have a few . Somebody set a tumbler here and didn 't use no coaster . Hmm . That 's a family heirloom too . Is there no chance that your son could have put it there ? Izzy 's got more brains than that . Not much more , but he values his life . That pigsty there is his room . You know what this thing is , don 't you , agent Mulder ? Why do you say that ? 'Cause you 're all quiet and stuff . And you know something you 're not saying about alien abductions . They said on Jerry Springer you 're like an expert . I don 't think this has anything to do with alien abductions . I don 't even know if I believe in that anymore . Oh , come on . Really ? [ Scully ] Mrs. Berkowitz ? You gave a description of the intruder . You said he had a gross face and lumps on his head ? And two mouths . I don 't know if I mentioned that . Funny . Sounds just like this . [ Shaineh ] oh , that . That 's " the great mutato . " That 's the comic book character my kid , Izzy , created . [ Door opening ] What 's going on ? These are agents Mulder and Scully from the F.B.I. The federal bureau of investigation ? We were wondering ... How this suspect in your mother 's case looks exactly like this ? The great mutato . Because I 've seen him too . You 've seen the great mutato ? Yeah . A lot of people around here have . Has it crossed neither of your minds what you say you saw that night ... Fits perfectly with this creature that your son created ? Yeah , but ... That don 't mean it didn 't happen . Don 't ask me why , but it works . Peanut butter sandwiches ? You think bologna would be more effective ? Why are you humoring them , Mulder ? I 'm not humoring them . This is a very serious crime . So is perjury . So is calling out F.B.I. Agents under false pretenses . For the purpose of what ? Isn 't it obvious ? I think what we 're seeing here is an example ... Of a culture for whom daytime talk shows and tabloid headlines ... Have become a reality against which they measure their lives . A culture so obsessed by the media and a chance for self-Dramatization ... That they 'll do anything to gain a spotlight . I am alarmed that you would reduce these people to a cultural stereotype . Not everybody 's dream is to get on Jerry Springer . Psychologists often speak of the denial ... Of an unthinkable evil or a misplacement of shared fears , Anxieties taking the form of a hideous monster ... For whom the most horrific human attributes can be ascribed . What we can 't possibly imagine ourselves capable of ... We can blame on the ogre , on the hunchback , on the lowly half-Breed . [ Coughs ] Common sense alone will tell you that these legends , These unverified rumors , are ridiculous . But , nonetheless , unverifiable , And , therefore , true in the sense that they 're believed to be true . Is there anything that you don 't believe in , Mulder ? [ Moaning ] shh . [ Moaning ] What 's that sound ? [ Moaning continues ] It 's the great mutato . [ Thunderclap ] Where 'd it go ? I don 't know . I lost it . [ Thunder rumbling ] There ! Up there ! Turn that damn thing off ! - You 're on my property ! - We 're with the F.B.I. - They 're not ! - We were- - We were chasing what they told us was a monster . Monster ? What 'd I tell you boys ? There ain 't no monster . I 'll show you the monster you 're looking for . - Who sent you here ? - Your father . My father is a simpleton farmer . He understands nothing of my scientific achievements . What achievements are those ? What makes you thing you 'd understand them any better ? Well , I 'm a scientist , for one . Then you probably know that once in a generation , Perhaps once in a lifetime , a truth is uncovered ... Which thrusts mankind into a shocking new consciousness , Turning accepted notions of our very existence on their head . Consider relativity , double helix . And now the homeotic hox gene , for which I will undoubtedly ... Have my place among the columbuses of science as a visionary leader of men . - Yes ? - What do you want me to do with these , dr . Pollidori ? Never mind . What is the homeotic hox gene ? She 's a scientist . Ask her . I , uh , I believe that it has something to do with , um ... Growth and development . If you two will excuse me , I really don 't have time for this . I have to travel tonight to the university of Egostat ... To deliver an international address . Sir , unless you want your scientific achievements ... To end up as a footnote on the jerry Springer show , I suggest you make the time . [ Thunder rumbling ] Jerry Springer show ? Witness the morphogenesis of drosophila . The fruit fly . [ Thunderclap ] What you 're watching has been going on for a millennia , Since the Cambrian period some 580 million short years ago ... When drosophila was first born . Notice the elegant symmetry with which the pupae grows ... Into a series of beautiful segments . [ Thunderclap ] What we have found- - What I have found ... Is that these segments represent a linear model ... For the genetic development of our friend the fly . Each gene is responsible ... For the development of its corresponding segment . The legs , the mouth , the body , posterior and anterior . But which I , through my genius , Can alter into a creation of my own . Behold ... proboscopedia . This fly has legs- - Growing out of his mouth . Why would you do that ? Because I can . [ Thunderclap ] Could that be done in humans ? That would go against every scientific convention . But could it be done ? Theoretically . [ Thunderclap ] Good night , dr . Frankenstein . Despite what you might think , Mulder , Mutations like these are virtually impossible on humans . That 's not what I just heard . Even if they could , no scientist would even dare ... To perform those kinds of experiments on a human . Then why do them at all ? To unlock the mysteries of genetics . To understand how it is that , even though we share the same genes , We develop arms instead of wings ; We become humans instead of flies or monsters . But , given the power , who could resist ... The temptation to create life in his own image ? We already have that ability . It 's called procreation . And first thing tomorrow morning , I 'm gonna verify the pregnancy of Shaineh Berkowitz . When are you coming home again ? Huh ? When are you coming home again ? What ? - We were gonna have that talk . - Soon , soon . We 'll have our talk soon . That 's what you always say . Elizabeth , you know how I feel about children . They 're mewling little monsters . - But I want children . - What happened to our dream ... About getting out of this place , getting away from this hick town ? I think that 's your dream . Elizabeth , What do you want , a baby or a Nobel prize ? See you on Thursday . [ Car engine starts ] [ Sobbing ] [ Bell on door jingles ] Hot plates ! Hot , hot , hot ! Biscuits , fritters , grits , Flapjacks , eggs ; boiled , scrambled , poached and fried . We got some monster grapefruits on the way , bigger than your head almost . I-I 'd just like some coffee . Thanks . On the house , compliments of J.J. That 's with two " j 's . " Is it true Jerry Springer 's coming to town ? [ Bell on door jingles ] We 've been had . I 'll save you the trouble of reading the article . It has everything that we talked about last night , word for word . Izzy Berkowitz , get your butt front and center ! What did I do ? All I can say is , I hope the answer to that question is " nothing . " We have reason to believe that you or one of your friends ... Recorded our conversation last night ... - And gave it to a newspaper reporter . - Me ? In order to promote your comic book monster that you created . Do you own a tape recorder , Izzy ? Um- - Christmas , 1993 ! [ Scully on tape ] ... of shared fears . Anxieties taking the form of a hideous monster ... For whom the most horrific human attributes can be ascribed . That 's for starters . [ Tape continues ] [ Pushes button , tape rewinds ] ? [ Cher on tape ] hey ! Hey , that 's it ! That 's the song that was playing when I got knocked up . ? [ Cher continues ] - [ Man moaning on tape ] - Who the hell is that ? That 's the same voice we heard out in the woods last night . That 's him : the great mutato . [ Singing along ] ? The sun ain 't gonna shine anymore ? ? The moon ain 't gonna rise in the sky ? ? The tears are always clouding your eyes ? ? The sun ain 't gonna shine anymore ? ? When you 're without love ? ? Love ? Where are we going now ? Messenger this to the bureau . I want to filter the tracks and separate out the voice , And then I want to see the professor . This is just a dopey hoax . Something recorded its voice on this . Do you think dr . Pollidori had something to do with it ? When victor Frankenstein asks himself , " Whence did the principal of life proceed , " And then , as the gratifying summit to his toils , Creates a hideous phantasm of a man , He prefigures the postmodern Prometheus , The genetic engineer whose power to reanimate matter , Genes into life- - Us- - Is only as limited as his imagination is . I 'm alarmed that you would reduce this man ... To a literary stereotype , a " mad scientist . " Who else would go to such trouble to impregnate Shaineh Berkowitz ? [ Car engine starts ] [ Scully ] I 'll have to admit , Mulder , Everything looks in order . Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation in 1993 ... And two months ago , she had two pregnancy tests , both with positive results . What are you doing ? Mrs. Berkowitz said in her letter that ... When she saw her intruder , there was a gaseous white cloud . Then when she woke up three days later , nobody knew that she 'd been gone . Yeah , so ? ? [ Cher ] ? I was born in the wagon of a travelin ' show ? ? My mama used to dance for the money they 'd throw ? ? Papa would do whatever he could ? ? Preach a little gospel ? ? Sell a couple bottles of doctor good ? ? ? Gypsies , tramps and thieves ? ? We 'd hear it from the people of the town , they 'd call us ? ? ? Gypsies , tramps and thieves ? ? But every night all the men would come around ? ? And lay their money down ? [ Coughing ] Come out . [ Coughs ] Get up ! Move ! [ Coughing ] Mulder ? [ Coughing ] I told you , there ain 't no monster . [ Coughing ] [ coughing ] What are you doing in my house ? He had this awful face with these hideous tumors ... And not one mouth but two . Oh , my God . Dr. Pollidori ? Is there something you 'd like to tell us ? Are you accusing me of knowing something I 'm not telling you ? I 'm accusing ... that your wife may have been impregnated . Impregnated ? By whom ? Oh , I think you know . Sir , with all due respect , I think this is all part of a hoax . A hoax ? - A hoax ? - A shameless publicity stunt . Scully . What ? What is that ? The other victims , they had their frying pans ... violated . Do you know what that is ? No , I don 't . I think we found our smoking gun . [ Whooping ] hey , mom . You look great . [ Son over TV ] hey , gar . Mom , I got some great news . [ Mom over TV ] me too . You first . I quit . I 'm clean as a whistle . Here . Brought you your favorite . [ TV continues ] You finish your movie . Don 't stay up too late . Okay , son ? [ Son over TV ] well , that 's a start . What about your news ? It 's no big deal . I met a girl . We 're going out . [ Whooping ] what 's her name ? Her name is Diana . Yeah . Yeah . She 's beautiful . She rides horses , and she 's beautiful and smart ... And she loves me . What 's not to love , baby . Tell me it isn 't true . You didn 't . You wouldn 't . Why ? Because I can . [ Door closes ] Excuse me . Not a problem . [ Spits ] - What 's this ? - [ Waitress ] compliments of J.J. - Coffee ? - Sure . That 's not a place you want to burn a guy . [ Boy ] come on ! [ Man ] what is it ? Come on , hurry ! Come on ! [ Crowd chattering ] You want to see your monster ? [ Crowd ] yeah ! You really want to see your monster ? Yeah ! Here 's your monster . - [ All gasp ] - His name is Izzy Berkowitz ! - [ Man ] string him up ! - Get your hands off him ! You let him go ! I intercepted a package . How would you like your face to intercept my fist , Coconut head ? [ Man ] your kid 's the monster ! [ All ] yeah ! Yeah ! That is my son you 're talking about ! [ Crowd , Shaineh arguing ] Mulder ? You may have been right , Scully . That these people can be reduced to cultural stereotypes ? - They unmasked the monster . - Don 't even talk that way to me ! I may have found something that says otherwise . The residue on the frying pan was an agricultural product ... Used to anesthetize herds of animals . Used by who ? Farmers , who have to register ... With the F.D.A. To have it in their possession . Is there someone registered locally ? Mm-Hmm . [ Moaning ] [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] [ Continues sobbing ] - [ Sobbing ] - [ Grunting ] [ Digging ] [ Sobbing ] Mulder ? We may be too late . I think we are . [ Boards creaking ] Who 's that ? Show yourself ! [ Chicken clucking ] [ Scully ] if you 're armed , drop your weapon and walk out slowly ! Please don 't . Don 't kill me . - Who are you ? - I 'm with the newspaper . [ Mulder ] what 's your business here ? The old man was murdered . By whom ? It 's alive . I 've seen it . In the barn , burying the old man . [ Angry crowd approaching ] [ Chattering , yelling ] [ Crowd approaching ] [ Chattering continues ] Whatever you have in mind , I have to ask you to stop right there . We have come for the murderer ! [ Crowd ] yeah ! What makes you think he 's here ? I 've seen him with my own eyes . He is not a man . He is a monster ! Yeah ! The fiend must be found ! And then we 'll let justice take its course ! Yeah ! Search every crevice , every ravine ! You get him alive if you can , but you get him ! Yeah ! Yeah ! [ Crowd departing ] [ Whinnying ] - [ Shouting , indistinct ] - [ Squealing ] There 's only one way Pollidori could have seen that monster , If he was out here himself . [ Door creaking ] Mulder . Federal agents , and we 're armed ! Come on out ! Scully , look at this . Oh , my god . You 're gonna have to come out of there . [ Scully ] we 're not gonna hurt you . Do you think he understands ? I hope not . [ Scully ] he looks frightened . We have to get him out of here , Scully . They 're gonna kill him . The barn 's on fire ! [ Crowd , animals panicking ] There it is ! [ Crowd ] let 's go ! Let 's get him ! [ Crowd approaching ] [ Dr. Pollidori ] let him go . Where is he ? You let him go , or we 'll burn him out . Where is he ? Show the world your horrid , lumpy face ! [ Crowd shouting ] - That 's him . - Yuck . That repulsive physiognomy is the vilest perversion of science . Created by whom ? A pale student of my most hallowed arts ... Whose life was taken by that which he gave life ; By his own horrible creation ; by that monstrosity that you see before you . Who 's he talkin ' about ? My father . [ Gasps ] No . [ Shaineh ] he can talk . Your ears deceive you . It 's a trick ! [ Angry murmuring ] I 'm sorry , my voice is damaged by the gaseous chemicals , But I would like to explain myself . Despite my appearance , Which you see is quite horrible to the human senses , I have never acted to harm another soul . - These are fiendish lies ! - Quiet . Twenty-Five years ago , My father , having only one son- - A spiteful , hateful man of science ... Incapable of the deeper sentiments- - He came to realize that this son , Had been conducting secret experiments , Of which I was the most unfortunate product . [ Crowd gasps ] A simple man , he rescued me and loved me ... In spite of my deformity . But as time passed , I grew restless for friends of my own . Because I couldn 't go to school or play sports ... Or even show my face outside this farm , My father set out to learn his son 's science ... So that before he died he might create for me a mate . Uh-Oh . Alas , my father was a simple man ; His heart close to the soil he worked , The animals he tended . The experiments he attempted , too advanced ; The science too complex for his understanding . The results of his experiments unsatisfactory . [ Clucking ] [ Bleating ] I still- - You mean Izzy- - But who 's the father ? [ Oinking ] Suffice to say , his experiments failed . My father is dead . I am alone and miserable . If one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me , If this being you can create , I will take blame as a murderer . I don 't know how to re-Create you . You were a mistake . What we did was wrong . But in our trespasses , we gave you a loving son . And in your homes ... I went places I never dreamed of . With your books and your records ... And your home media centers , I learned of the world . And of a mother 's love that I 'll never know . Cher loved that boy so much . Hey ... He 's no monster . Arrest me then , as you will . [ Siren blares ] We should go , Mulder . The prisoner 's in the car . This is all wrong , Scully . This is not how the story 's supposed to end . What do you mean ? Dr. Frankenstein pays for his evil ambitions , yes , But the monster is supposed to escape to go search for his bride . There 's not gonna be any bride , Mulder . Not in this story . Where is the writer ? We need to speak to the writer . ? [ Cher ] ? Put on my blue suede shoes ? ? And I boarded the plane ? ? Touched down in the land of the delta blues ? ? In the middle of the pouring rain ? ? W.C. Handy ? ? ? Won 't you look down over me ? ? Yeah , I got a first-Class ticket ? ? But I 'm as blue as a girl can be ? ? When I 'm walking in Memphis ? ? I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale ? ? Walking in Memphis ? ? Do I really feel the way I feel ? ? Saw the ghost of Elvis ? ? On union avenue ? ? Followed him up to the gates of Graceland ? ? And I watched him walk right through ? ? Now security they did not see him ? ? They just hovered around his tomb ? ? There 's a pretty little thing waiting for the king ? ? ? Down in the jungle room ? ? When I was walking in Memphis ? ? I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale ? ? Walking in Memphis ? ? Do I really feel the way I feel ? Tell me something . Is it hard to love these babies ? What 's not to love ? [ Cheering ] ? Walking in Memphis ? ? Walking in Memphis ? ? I was walking with my fee t ten feet off of Beale ? ? Walking in Memphis ? ? Walking in Memphis ? ? Do I really feel the way I feel ? ? ? Put on my blue suede shoes ? [ Child ] I made this !

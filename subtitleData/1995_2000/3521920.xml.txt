 [ Child Humming ] Geese walk barefoot Kri kra toad 's foot I finished my building . I 'm finished This one 's been with us for only 36 hours ... and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . Hey ! I 'm finished ! Hi , Jarod . I 'm Sydney . - I 'll be taking care of you for a while . - Why ? Where 's my mom and dad ? [ Man Narrating ] Ma 'am , the materials on board are highly explosive . So am I. I never agreed with the company ... about flushing our tanks at sea . I knew those chemicals had to be doing something nasty . Yeah , I 'm glad Captain Jarod turned us in . You know , I , uh , kinda miss the guy . Although , uh , he was a little weird . [ Chuckles ] Everything with him was always " 20 Questions . " And always the same subject . - Which was ? - People . This belong to Curious George Yeah . Everything is just the way he left it . Company made sure of that . Say , are you pullin 'my cork aboutJarod not really being a captain ? Thank you for your help . What is it ? Articles about that Aluet village ... where everyone was getting sick from the contaminated fish . He must have been in quite a hurry , leaving all this behind . It 's got to be intentional . A bread crumb . He 's trying to keep me close . Your little monster needs his teddy bear , huh , Sydney ? Jarod is not a monster . [ Giggles ] Call him what you want , Dr. Frankenstein . Just tell me where he is . I don 't know where he is , Miss Parker . But I 'm afraid I know what he 's up to . [ Woman On P.A. , Indistinct ] Sir , don 't do this . Lie down . - [ Chattering ] - [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Man ] Excuse me . Excuse me . - [ Woman Speaking Greek ] - My mother 's here for her exploratory . - You 're in the wrong place . - You want Admitting . - [ Continues Speaking Greek ] - Speak English , honey . - She won 't speak English . She says she doesn 't want to be cut open . She doesn 't trust doctors . I don 't blame her . [ Nurse ] End of the hall . [ Man Shouting ] She swallowed a marble . ! B.P. ' s 80 over 40 . Pulse is 110 . Rapid and thready . She 's cyanotic . - Get Dr. Shapiro ! - [ Woman ] He 's in O.R. 3 . ! Then page Dr. Trader ! Hold on , sweetie . You 'll be fine . Nicole , get E.N.T. , stat ! - All right , fellas . Let 's go . Move it . ! One , two , three , go . ! - Dr. Trader to O.R. 3 . ! - [ Paramedic ] Got it ? - [ Nurse ] Hyperextend her head . - Where is Trader ? - I paged him . He 's not answering . ! - Her pressure 's falling . - Get me a three-c.c. syringe and a size eight E. T. tube . Get Security to get this man out ofhere . What do you think you 're doing ? - She 's going into respiratory arrest . - She 's not breathing . - Would you like to do the trach ? - 02 set right down . - Prepare to ventilate . - No ! Get Security ! - [ Nurse ] Get a doctor . ! - I am a doctor . [ Officer ] What 's the problem ? - Gwen ? - Leave him be . Give me the syringe . Remove the plunger . Give me the top of the E. T. tube . Bag . [ Air Expelling ] - What is going on here ? - Air entry on both sides of the chest . She 's pinking up . - [ Girl Inhaling , Wheezing ] - Now , that 's a nice sound . [ Jarod ] Well , I hope I didn 't cause too much confusion this morning . Don 't apologize . You saved a life . Oh , Dr. Hendricks . I need your signature on lines 10 and 14 , please . F.Y.I. , Russell , if you need anything done around here , ask Gwen . I may run this place , but she is the boss . [ Gwen ] Thank you . Doctors . Miles . ! Sorry . I 'm late . Dr. Jarod Russell , Dr. Alan Trader , Chief of Surgery . Nice to meet you . I hear I missed you in action this morning , Doctor . Never seen a trach like that . Is that a new procedure they 're teaching at Hopkins ? - Well , actually , I read it in a book . - [ Laughing ] Well , wherever you learned it ... I appreciate you standing in for me like that . I don 't know what happened to my damn beeper , but ... it won 't happen again . Brand-new . Even takes messages . Please , sit down . Well , your record at Hopkins was impeccable . We are honored to have you on board . Not many doctors with your credentials come to a hospital as small as ours . Why Queen of Angels ? Well , I could tell you it was for the career opportunity ... but the truth is , you were the only hospital offering stock options ... and rumor has it you might be purchased by an H.M.O. - [ Chuckling ] - We 've been talking to some people . - [ Laughing ] - Don 't worry , Russell . Stick with us , and you 'll be driving a new Lexus in no time . [ Both Laughing ] But on to more important business . Do you play racquetball ? - I 've heard of it . - Good . Good . We 'll have a game . Well , welcome to Queen of Angels . We are thrilled to have you . It 's a pleasure to be here . [ Miss Parker ] Imagine my excitement at being recalled from corporate . Only you ... could have created a mess big enough to put me back in the field . I am thrilled to be working with you as well . Hmm . Not for long . We 've tagged Jarod 's account in Anchorage . He uses an A.T.M. anywhere , and he 's ours . Don 't underestimate him . If we 're to catch him , we 'll need to be patient . Look , Syd , you may be satisfied in your laboratory ... probing small minds to solve big problems . But I have career goals that don 't include schlepping across country ... chasing after Boy Wonder . You were such a happy little girl . What happened to you ? - [ Beeping ] - I grew up , Sydney . - [ Buzz ] - So should you . This is a waste of energy . I 've been through Jarod 's room a thousand times . I haven 't . - What are you hoping to find ? - He left a bread crumb on the tanker . And I 'll bet he left one here . Run the sim . This is Jarod 's last project . When the black box on this flight wasn 't recovered ... he simulated the final moments of the crash . Using his innate Pretender skills ... Jarod effectively became each member of the cockpit crew ... and pinpointed the cause of the crash for our client . Hmm . Hell of an environment you keep him in , Syd . And with input like this , maybe we 'll find him ... masquerading as a postal worker . He doesn 't masquerade . He 's a Pretender . - Hmm . - He becomes anything he wants to be . Well , the Centre should have stuck to computers for their simulations . - They don 't run away . - But they 're not human . They can 't tell you how the crew was feeling as the aircraft lost power ... how their emotions contributed to their fate . Jarod can . Very , very clever . - Do you know what this is ? - An origami angel . But I haven 't figured out the emotional connection to him yet . It 's not an angel . Its wings are bent . It 's Onisius . The Greek god of retribution . He defends the weak and abused . I 'm impressed . How come you know so much about Greek lore ? Oh , I did a lot of frat boys in college . Here 's your bread crumb , Sydney . Your sociopath thinks he is some kind of vigilante ... getting even for the little guy . St. Andrew 's Middle School , Queens . [ Ice Cream Truck ] - It tastes better before it melts . - Oh . Right . This is good ! This is really very good ! Do they whip air into it to fluff it up ? I don 't make it , pal . I just serve it . - [ School Bell Rings ] - [ Children Chattering ] [ Boy ] Come on . ! Shoot it . ! Shoot it . ! - [ Yells ] - [ Shouting , Chattering ] [ Car Alarm Blaring ] Now , this is fascinating . They win money by guessing word puzzles ? You 've never seen Wheel of Fortune ? What rock you been living under ? Uh , I 've been busy . " The courtship of Miles Standish . ' " [ Loud Whistle ] Hey ! Uh , we got us a little situation here . Uh , the A.T.M. says that your bank account in Alaska has been frozen . - No pun . - [ Chuckling ] Now , maybe you 're happy , but I 'm out a Benjy for my efforts . Did you do what I asked ? My friend , it was an Oscar-winning performance . Thank you . You 're giving me a C-note for finding out you 're broke ? We had an agreement . Hey , whatever sends you . Say , you know where to find me if you need me , huh ? [ Knock On Door ] Just a second . Come in . Good morning , Dr. Russell . Sorry to bother you , but could you go talk to the Greek lady ? She yells at everyone that goes to her room . No one understands what she 's saying . Okay . I 'll be right there . Nicole , do me a favor . Have the lab run a complete diagnostic testing on this . And put a rush on it ? - Sure . - Thank you . [ Door Closes ] [ Speaking Greek ] You a doctor ? I am today . You speak English . When I feel like it . And I don 't need no operation . - Hey ! - This hurts , doesn 't it ? Hell yes ! I haven 't gone for weeks . Well , you need to relax . How can I relax with all these tests ? And now they want to cut me open . Okay . If you don 't want surgery , I 'll cancel it . - No surgery ? - No . I 'm gonna try something else . You 're no doctor . You are human being . Mm-hmm . Sandy , make my day . Well , we have an A.T.M. hit on Jarod 's Anchorage account . Some genius . Satellite feed should be up in ... two seconds . He 's in Santa Fe , New Mexico . Call the hangar and get the jet ready . - Hold it . He 's not in Santa Fe . He 's in Rome . No , Luxembourg . - Chicago , New York . The little S.O.B. scrambled the A.T.M. system . Miami , Philadelphia , Barcelona . Hello , Jarod . - [ Gwen ] You canceled Mrs. Nikkos 's surgery ? - [ Jarod ] Yes , I did . Fine . You 're the doctor . As long as I don 't get blamed for anything . And I would like to try her on an herb tea called Cassia Senna . Doctor , this is Queens . We don 't do tea . We do now . And I 'd like the key to Radiology , please . Well , Andy 's out to lunch , but ... - I know . - There you are . Thank you . - Hi ! - Hi , Mama ! How you doin ' , little sugar baby ? Ooh . ! There he is . ! There he is . ! Bring Mommy lunch today ? Ooh . ! There he is . ! There he is . ! Bring Mommy lunch today ? Guess what it is . [ Gwen ] I 'm hoping for tuna fish or peanut butter . I could use a hand with these . That is , if you have one free . - Oh , God . It 's Dr. Russell . - [ Andy ] Dr. Russell ? I 'm new . I 'm , uh , embarrassed . But , um , always , uh ... always happy to help , Doc . [ Clears Throat ] Uh , now ... Uh , I don 't understand . Kevin Bailey is Dr. Trader 's patient . Any special reason you 're looking at these ? Any special reason that you 're in here half naked ? I can be forgetful if you can . All right . Your problem is right here ... at the T-eighth . The eighth thoracic vertebrae was crushed , severing his spinal cord . - Kid never had a chance . - That I understand . But look here . This is the pre-op , and this is the post-op X-ray . - Yeah . - But both of them are identical . - How is that possible ? - It 's not . Someone must have made a duplicate of the post-op X-ray . You see that fogging in the corner there ? The old processor we keep in the basement does that . I spilled some soda on it when I first started working here . The new processor 's fog-free . Why would someone make a copy of a post-op X-ray and label it pre-op ? Makes you wonder . [ Young Jarod ] I 'm on the last flight of stairs ... terrified of what I 'm about to do . My heart 's pounding . My hands are sweating . I can hardly hold on to the package I told everyone was curtain rods . Sydney , is it possible for kids to forget their parents ? [ Sydney ] Keep your mind focused , Jarod . Concentrate on the simulation . As I near the window ... I can hear the sounds of the crowd rising from below . [ Young Jarod ] I can see them coming . - How fast are they going ? - Forty miles per hour . You know that . My mouth 's dry . My hands are shaking . I raise the Mannlicher carbine . I can 't fire enough shots before the car goes under the overpass . I can 't . I can 't do this alone . He wasn 't alone . [ Jarod ] He had to have had help . Trader wasn 't alone either , Sydney . [ Exhales ] [ Grunts , Laughs ] [ Gasps ] Good one . [ Exhales ] Good game . [ Panting ] Don 't let it bother you . He never lets anyone win . - [ Jarod Laughs ] - At leastJarod 's competitive . - He 's young . - And you 're lazy . - Yeah , well , there is that . - [ Both Laughing ] Calsix . You have a heart problem ? Miles is a type-A time bomb . Two heart attacks . One more , and it 's bypass time . Which is why I play racquetball . And I need a refill . So do I. Um ... It 's my day off . You exercise your way , I 'll exercise mine . [ Chuckles ] - So , Jarod , does Queen of Angels get a passing grade ? - Absolutely . Frankly , I expected there to be more fallout from the malpractice problems . Well , unfortunately , that 's the cost of doing business . We 've had our difficulties , but I would put Queen of Angels ' record up against any hospital . Are you sure there 's no hidden land mines , even with the Kevin Bailey case ? Well , that was a tragedy , but let 's face it ... an orphaned boy in a wheelchair make for sensational headlines . It was a damned witch hunt . Yes . Once the frenzy died down , the truth took over , and we were exonerated . That is all behind us now . [ School Bell Rings ] [ Shouting , Chattering ] - Get serious . - It 's good . Hasn 't anyone ever told you ? You talk to strangers , you end up on milk cartons . My name 's Jarod . It tastes better before it melts . Your hands still cramp up when you wheel ? What would you know about it ? I have a good imagination . [ Kids Screaming , Shouting , Chattering ] [ Sighs ] It 's gonna get better . [ Car Horn Honks ] I promise . [ Woman ] Sir , there 's a Shreve Harmon calling on line seven . Shreve and Harmon built the Empire State Building . Put him through and trace the call . [ Buzz ] [ Chuckling ] Very clever , Jarod . Are you all right ? I 'm broke . You froze my bank account . I must have just missed you in Cincinnati . The flowers were still fresh . Well , my parents have been dead for 30 years . I figured it was time I said good-bye . - I want you to come home . - [ Chuckles ] There 's an interesting way to put it ... " home . " - Why did you leave ? - You 're the shrink , Sydney . You want the truth ? It 's because of the lies . Your lies . What lies ? I found out the real application of my simulations , Sydney . South Pacific fleet simulation 118 . You took my results and blew a ship out of the water . A hundred and 33 people were on board . My outbreak simulation ? You used it in the field . Forty-six people died of the Ebola virus , Sydney . Simulation 27 . Simulation 16 . Simulation 42 . Jarod , these were military contracts . I had no way of finding out about their ultimate application . How many people died because of what I thought up ? You need to come home . I 'm worried about you . I 've been walking around your room , and it feels ... empty . Well , I can 't say I miss it . And by the way ... ice cream is good . Jarod , this is getting serious . - They brought in Miss Parker . - Uh-oh . Well , you better watch your back too , Sydney . - What are you doing , Jarod ? - Using the skills you taught me . [ Man ] I 'm completely locked out here . I got nothin ' . - Are you getting anything ? - No . Let me try a new access code . - Talk to me . - We 've been locked out . Our client hired us to see if the stock exchange was vulnerable to manipulation . - Jarod spent four months on this simulation . - What 's the problem ? The client gave us five million to testJarod 's results . Jarod knew today was the day of the test . Everything was going to plan until someone on the floor started to manipulate markets . - They 've stolen our five million . - Gee . I wonder who that could be . Well , at least we know where he is . [ Laughing ] That 's some kind medicine you got there . I might laugh myself dead before I poop ! [ Chuckling ] Laughter is very good medicine . And so is reflexology . Nicole , massage these marks , would you , please ? Thanks . You gonna tell me the truth ? What truth ? A man who gives me the sun ... who massages my feet ... who gives me stinky tea ... Who are you ? Oh , so much sadness . And so much joy . [ Miss Parker ] Comforting to know there are only 137 hospitals ... in the metropolitan New York area . Your rooms have been prepaid , Miss Parker . - Prepaid ? - In cash . And the gentleman left this . Not a word . - Alan . Hey . - Jarod , hi . Hi . Denise , I 'll have another ginger ale , please . - Make that two ginger ales . - Okay . Either you 've just been mugged ... or it 's been one hell of a shift . Four gunshot wounds , a lobectomy and a ruptured spleen ... and I 'm only halfway through . Alan , I think I might have screwed up today . Really screwed up . Hey , how you doin ' ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Hey , look , is this Trader 's exchange ? Good . Look , I gotta get a message to him . Yeah . So ... what 's the trouble ? The lobectomy ? I think I left a hemo inside when I sewed her up . - No problem . - No problem ? - You think that 's gonna make the H.M.O. happy ? - Check her chart . If the white count is spiked , you 've found your hemo . Well , then what ? Take it out . Tell her you found some internal bleeding . - Hey , you 're the doctor . - Oh . - [ Pager Beeping ] - Ah . Always count on it happening on your lunch break , huh ? Um , I gotta get back . - Well , thank you for the advice , Alan . - Yeah . [ Typing On Keyboard ] [ Knock On Door ] - [ Beeps ] - Come in . Oh , good . You 're still here . The lab report on that blood workup you asked for . - Thank you . - Sure . [ Door Closes ] This one 's been with us for only 36 hours ... and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . Hey ! I 'm finished ! Hi , Jarod . I 'm Sydney . - I 'll be taking care of you for a while . - Why ? Where 's my mom and dad ? - Where 's my mom and da ... - [ Clicks Off ] [ Horn Blasting ] [ Man ] Please evacuate the building . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - Keep moving . Please remain calm . Thank you . - Sydney . Downstairs . - Please make your way to the emergency exits . - This way . - [ Woman ] Wait up for me . - [ Alarm Continues Blaring ] - Just one minute , sir . [ Female Voice ] Please exit your room and proceed to the nearest stairway exit . My God . Sorry to wake you , Sydney ... but I needed to speak to you face-to-face . You look well . What 's this ? Instructions for retrieving the Centre 's five million . - Less my commission . - [ Chuckles ] Don 't look so surprised . I don 't want money . I want the truth . What are you talking about ? Who am I ? Did the Centre adopt me ? Was I bought , or was I stolen ? And where are my mom and dad ? Jarod , we 've been over this a thousand times . Your parents died in a plane crash . Yes , I know the story , Sydney . It 's been burned into my brain for 30 years . But , you see , I did a little checking . There 's this genetic anomaly that 's in my blood ... that should be in my supposed parents . But it 's not . Therefore , it 's impossible that I 'm their son . So , the truth , for once . - [ Man ] I thought you quit . - [ Miss Parker ] Shut up . Where were you going , Sydney ? - Damn it ! - What ? No smoke ! Out of my way ! I 'm sorry , Jarod . I didn 't know . You have to believe me . But it doesn 't matter . It matters to me . I am not gonna be your little science experiment anymore , Sydney . I can be anything I want to be . You trained me well . I can be a doctor . I can be an engineer . I can be an astronaut ! And so much more ! But I don 't know who I am ! - Tell me who I am . - I don 't know either . At the time , I had no reason to question what the Centre told me . - I swear . - Then prove it . Give me tomorrow 's code to the Centre 's mainframe . The truth about who I am has to be in there . - You know I can 't do that . - Sydney , you stole my life ! Please give it back to me . Sydney . ! Shoot him . ! 7-5-1-2 . Go . - [ Gunshot ] - [ Sydney ] No . ! No guns . ! - Let me go ! - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Grunting ] Make up your mind , Sydney ! Be a scientist or a mommy ! You can 't be both ! - [ Man On P.A. ] Your attention , please . - [ Train Horns Blowing ] Final call for all passengers departing on the Atlantic Special ... to Washington , D. C ... with stops in Trenton , Philadelphia and Baltimore . Now boarding on Platform 12 . All aboard , please . Excuse me . Gwen . Gwen ! - Dr. Russell . - Can I speak to you for a minute ? Is there a problem ? You 're not supposed to have that . I knew that Trader was involved . What I couldn 't figure out was why would anybody help him cover it up ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . I didn 't either , until I found this . It 's a printout of your record . Who else knew you were in prison besides Trader ? Who the hell are you ? Someone that doesn 't think what happened to Kevin Bailey 's fair . A-And you think I do ? You don 't know what it took for me to get back on my feet . I 've got a job . I 've got a good man . I 've got a beautiful baby boy . I don 't want to lose them . I don 't want you to lose anything . Just tell the truth . What would you do if your wife came home and told you ... that she 'd been a crackhead and a convict ? I 'd say she paid her debt . And I 'd ask her why she didn 't trust me enough to tell me the truth . At least that 's what I think I would do . You don 't know how scared I am . I think I do . I had to page Dr. Trader that night at the Silver Rail . We all knew he drank ... but nobody wanted to admit it . I showed him the X-rays . Even I knew that the boy should have been stabilized ... but he insisted I was wrong and ... He was the doctor . He severed the little boy 's spinal cord when he moved him . But it was Dr. Hendricks who covered it all up ... and threatened to expose my past if I didn 't go along . See , uh ... when Trader realized what he 'd done ... he gave me the pre-op X-rays and told me to burn them . But I couldn 't . I went to Dr. Hendricks instead . I don 't know why I thought it would do any good . He 's been covering for Trader for years . He took the X-rays ... and he made me swear that I wouldn 't tell anybody that he had ' em . He said that he might be able to use them for insurance . [ Sighs ] Thank you . Dr. Hendricks isn 't gonna give you that film . He 'd rather die than risk that hospital sale . - Dr. Trader . - Alan ? It 's Jarod . - We need to talk . - About what ? Uh , not on the phone . Can you meet me today at the Silver Rail at noon ? - I 'll be there . - Thanks , Alan . [ Punching Keypad ] Miles . Jarod Russell . Jarod . What can I do for you ? How about another game of racquetball ? Why would you want another game so soon after I crushed you ? [ Chuckles ] To return the favor . How about today at noon ? Well , it 's your funeral . Well , we all have to go sometime . - [ Groans ] - Point , game , match . Toss me my water , will ya ? Sure , Miles . [ Hendricks Grunting ] Geez . [ Sighs ] So , Jarod , why the self-torture ? Well , I figure I let you win a few games ... I earn your pity , you cut me a better stock option . Well , my pity doesn 't come cheap . I 'll tell you something ... you ran me all over that court . You are getting better . - I 've been practicing . - Ah . But I won . [ Gasping , Panting ] You okay , Miles ? Jarod ... [ Gasping ] Miles ? Can somebody call an ambulance ? Dr. Russell says he 's running a bit late . Show me a doctor who isn 't , huh ? I 'll have another quick one . Sure . Get O.R. 3 set . Dr. Hendricks is having a heart attack . [ Woman ] Watch your back . ! Pulse is 112 and thready . B.P. has dropped from 75 to 60 . I want you to start him on a nitro drip and get him prepped for surgery , stat ! You lied to me . Last night , you told meJarod came here to return the five million . - All he really wanted was the mainframe code . - It was the least I could do . He was lied to about his parents . So was I. Stop pouting . It was need-to-know . You didn 't . Anyway , you 've done us all a great favor . You see , I tagged Jarod 's file . - He logged on this morning . - Where is he ? Queen of Angels Hospital . They 're bringing the car around now . Let 's go . The Centre wants him alive . Preferably . [ Monitor Beeping ] Miles , we were unable to bring in a cardiologist fast enough . But don 't worry . I paged Dr. Trader . No ... He 'll take care of you , Miles . - He took care of Kevin Bailey . - No . [ Gasping ] Please . You do the operating . Okay , okay ... O-Okay , Miles . No problem . But first ... you tell me where Kevin Bailey 's pre-op X-rays are . [ Continues Gasping ] Behind the Punjab painting in my office . Now , you do the operation , Jarod . l-l-I 'd like to , Miles . I really would . But that wouldn 't be ethical . You see ... I 'm not really a doctor . And you 're not really having a heart attack . Trader , he 's all yours . Okay . Let 's do this . [ Wheezing ] Jarod . Jarod ... [ Miss Parker ] We 'll start on the first floor and work our way up . Jarod does not leave . Nicole ? Would you page Security and have them stop Dr. Trader from operating ? - He 's drunk . - Oh , my God ! Yeah . You take that side . Jarod ! Guess what . Guess what I did today . ! Oh ! Well , that 's great ! Sorry . He 's got to be in one of these rooms . [ Mrs. Nikkos Screams ] Let 's go ! Hey . ! A man . ! He ran out the fire escape . ! He 's heading to the roof ! - [ Speaks Greek ] - [ Mrs. Nikkos Laughs ] [ Speaks Greek ] Jarod ! [ Woman On P.A. ] Your attention , please . Flight 1428 to San Diego will be departing from Gate 12 . Please have your boarding passes ready . You 'd better board , sir . You don 't wanna miss the flight . Don 't worry . They 're not going anywhere without me . [ Mews ]

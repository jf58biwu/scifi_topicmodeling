Where 's the 61st ? - We got the right coordinates ? - Schankowitz is right . Enough hide-and-seek already . Shane , hold up ! 2.7 klicks ... north-northwest of bull 's-eye . This is where the distress call originated . Hey , what 's the name of this place again ? - Planet 's called Cer . - Nice . - What 's that mean ? - Nothing . Just named after the Greek god of violent death . That 's all . - Oh , God ! - Why can 't we ever get a planet with a friendly name ? Like the planet Chuckles or something . Incoming ! It 's just lightning . All right . Let 's move out . - Keep your 5-irons down . - Go ! - Hey . - I got a charge out of it . Let 's just ... find the 61st ... and ... then let 's get out of here .

Use this to unjam it ! Fall back to the ship ! Move out ! I 'll cover you ! Fall back ! Make sure I get that back ! All hands , bury the dead . Tonight , we honor the lives and memories ... of those men and women of the 58th Squadron ... whose deaths were not in vain ... and whose memories will stay with us forever . Lieutenants Damphousse , Vansen ... Wang , Hawkes , Churchill ... Powell , Lindon ... Tell and Schankowitz . We honor their request for this special burial . Let us pray . " O Lord , we commend to thee the souls of thy servants ... " that , having departed this world ... " they may live with thee ; " and by the grace of thy merciful love ... " wash away the sins that they , in human frailty ... committed in the conduct of their lives . " Amen . Squadron , atten-hut ! Ready ! Aim ! Fire ! Aim ! Fire ! Aim ! Fire ! Present harms ! You gonna eat this ? Mm . I saw their caskets . You had a burial at space . I asked the doc if you could attend . He said it was ... too soon . It is . I see them . I can find them . I just can 't remember . You can 't forget . Every time I close my eyes ... I hear this voice . I ... I don 't know ... familiar ... over and over . " Stay with the dead . " You feel guilt because it wasn 't you . But , Nathan , you have to know . They aren 't aware . They 're dead . We found their remains , and guilt right now is useless . I 've been where you are , Nathan . I lost the entire Angry Angels Squadron at the start of the war . And the only way I pulled through ... was to understand that , next time , it could be me . It 's them . It was them ... the 61st . No . That 's not all the 61st . Let 's find the rest before this happens again . All right . All right , Let go . Let go . Nurse ! Diazepam ! 15 milligrams . Okay , okay . Hypervigilance , intrusive recollections . Intense psychological distress . These are all symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder . We needn 't let him suffer like this , Colonel . - There are procedures we can do that can help ... - Electroconvulsive therapy . It 's helped veterans of the A.I. Rebellion . Actually , it 's recommended by the V.A. Then something must be wrong with it . A fiber-optic laser scalpel ... is inserted into the posterior commissure . Then a paraldehyde solution is very carefully administered ... You destroy his long-term memory . But consider the alternative , Colonel . Deterioration ... till his condition erupts ... into manic violence or suicide . I 'd like to believe we 've come a long way since the 20th century . Doctor . I 've known men ... friends ... who 've gone through this . They 're never the same . They don 't remember their own families . It 's like a gangrenous leg . We wish we didn 't have to amputate ... but it 's more important to save the patient . - He won 't remember the 58th . - They 're dead , Colonel . They 're not gonna hold it against him at the 10th reunion . I think that the real problem in this case ... may be you letting go of him . Colonel , it 's you , not Nathan , that needs to make a sacrifice . It 's you . Stay with the dead . Stay with the dead . Stay with the dead . Nathan , listen to me . Listen to me , please . If you keep insisting they 're alive ... the doctors will have to ... They 'll have to do things to help you . They will take control of you . Don 't let this happen . Don 't lose yourself . Let them go ... before I lose all of you . But they 're still alive . They are dead . You said so in your own voice . You 're just saying that . USS Saratoga communications transmission . Log date ... 12-3-63 , 0400 hours and 53 seconds . Echo-5-Delta . This is Zulu-niner-Bravo . Over . We got a real situation here . Requesting suppression fire and extraction ... from direction 2.7 klicks north-northwest of bull 's-eye . They 're all dead , everyone ... the 58th , the 61st . Everyone 's dead . I 'm the only one . It 's not true ! It 's not true ! - It 's not ! It 's not true ! - West ! Nathan ! - Stop it ! - It 's not true ! It 's all right . West ! I put talc on ' em . You get blisters . You gotta wash ' em every day . - We can 't help him . - It don 't mean we shoot him ! - Take me out ! - If that 's what he wants ... Don 't come over here . I 'm rigged ! I can disengage you . No more of the 58th . The rest are dead . Incoming ! No ! No ! They 're all dead . You know this , West . They 're all dead . - Go away ! - Help ! Somebody ! Man down ! Somebody help me ! I have a man down here ! Come on , come on . Not my soul . You can 't touch my soul . You-You might 've killed my buddies ... you-all might 've gut-shot me , but you can 't touch my soul . Semper fi , Semper fi Marine Corps way is do or die - Semp ... - It 's Hatfield from the 61st . Hold tight , marine . We 're bringing you in . No ! Don 't come over here ! I 'm rigged ! - I can disengage you . - You can 't . It 's ... It 's approach-sensitive . - Stay the hell away ! - We 'll figure it out . - No ! - Come on . Wang . Take me out ! Please . Please ! - If that 's what he wants ... - Don 't even say it . - We can 't help him . - It don 't mean we shoot him . Oh , God ! - Please ! - We can 't leave him like this . This is just what the Chigs want ... us killing ' our own . We 'd do it for an animal . He 's not an animal ! Oh , God ! Please ! Please ! If it ever comes to this ... - I want the same . - No . If you won 't do it , I will ! We 're bringing you in ! We 're gettin ' you out of this ! Get back ! I 'll pull this thing myself ! Get back now ! Get back ! Get back ! Semper fi , Semper fi Marine Corps way is do or die Semper fi , Semper fi Marine Corps way is do or die Stay with the dead . Stay with the dead . No , no . Calm down . Relax . I know about your tape , and I 'm gonna figure it out . You think ... You think you can put me ... You think you can put me out of my misery . But it 's wrong , because they 're alive . We 're running out of time . We 've gotta get off this planet ... before we are all gutted and strung up ... just like the 61st . They must be monitoring our frequencies . We call for help , they triangulate and ambush . That means we 're cut off from the Saratoga ... no way to get extracted . We gotta put more distance between us and the Chigs . That way , the Saratoga can send a team to the L.Z. before they do . There 's too much static interference . There 's no way out of this sump . We 're all gonna get spammed . Altered state ? One . - Begin . - Hold still . You 'll be fine . Hold up . Static clusters ? Or the Chigs closing the gap . Let 's light ' em up . I 'm tired of watching ours die . It 's time to kill Chigs . You pop off rounds without a plan , you 're just gonna invite ' em here . Either way , we 're gonna get greased . So we play by their rules . They ambush our Red Cross . They booby-trap our wounded . I say we give it right back to them . We use the 61st as bait . Bait ? - The bodies of marines ? - There are no rules here . Yes . Our rules ... the rules that keep us human . We 're not fighting humans . When this is all played out , there 's nobody 's gonna say who was right and who was wrong . It 's gonna be who stayed alive . - So , what do you say we do ? - Fire with fire . We put the 61st in our uniforms ... just in case the Chigs know . We put out a distress call that the Chigs will monitor . When they come in to ambush us ... we have the perimeter planted with motion-sensory claymore mines . - We ambush them . - Desecrate our dead . - If that 's what it takes . - The marines have always gone back for their dead . This goes against everything we stand for . Oh ! They 're dead . They don 't know . Who ? Lindon , who I played dominoes with two nights ago ? You wanna use his body as bait ? - Wrong . - There are lives at stake here , Nathan ... ours . What if it were us dead ... and the 61st here now ? We would do it for them . These marines made the ultimate sacrifice . They 're in a better place than we are right now . Nathan , I know that you 're worried about the 61st . But their families aren 't gonna know their fates unless we make it back alive . Fine . Then I volunteer to be bait with them . Echo-5-Delta . This is Zulu-niner-Bravo . Over . We got a real situation here . Requesting suppression fire and extraction ... from direction 2.7 klicks ... north-northwest of bull 's-eye . He sounds good ... and real . They 're all dead . The 58th , the 61st ... everyone 's dead . I 'm the only one . Out . Nathan 's still in the kill zone . - Draw ' em to us ! - Get down ! The tape ! It was a trick ! Somebody ! So-Somebody ! Somebody ! The ta ... Somebody ! - Colonel ! - Yes , Nathan . I 'm here for you , all the way . - Colonel , you gotta listen to me . - We 're about to anesthetize him . Position dopamine visor . You 're ... Colonel , the taped distress call ... it was a trick . We were trying to lure the Chigs in for an ambush . - Respiration 30 . - It 'll be over soon . Prep . 30 megarems dopamine . They 're penetrating our flank ! Fall back to supplementary position ! Fall back ! Nathan ! You 're safer where you are ! Act dead ! Stay with the dead ! Stay with the dead ! McQueen . Just relax now . She-She 's alive . I ... I saw ... Shane running . The 58th ... they 're still alive . - Damn it , West . - The distress signal ... The ambush went wrong . I was gonna help ' em ... but ... Shane told me , " Stay with the dead . Stay with the dead bodies . " Stay ... Dead bodies . Play dead , see ? Stay with the dead . Augmenter . We 've gotta get them . I know where they are ... in that supplementary position . Th-They fell back to ... 5 ... 4 ... point ... 3 klicks ... west of bull 's-eye . Colonel . I 'm gonna need you to return to your position or leave the O.R. If you let them do this ... any chance of finding them ... is gone . Wai ... No . Wait ! What matters to me most ? You know this . The girl . Kylen . If you ask me ... if she 's alive ... I 'll tell you ... I don 't know . But ... I have faith in the 58th . I know they 're alive . And now I 'm asking ... I 'm begging you ... to have faith . - Sideburns . - Elvis . - We 'd given up on you guys . - Chigs must have taken Nathan 's body . The others are missing too . That 's the tactical frequency . Chigs 'll pull any gag to flush us into the open . Rendezvous at L.Z. for ISSCV extraction . - Signal back ! Tell ' em we 're ... - Chigs 'll triangulate . It 's another trick . We can 't trust it . Something garbled . No . It 's repeating . " Stay with the dead . " We can trust it . Hey . Someone took my photo ... the one with me in Memorial Stadium with Jimmy Wagner 's uniform on . Hey . Somebody stole my antique CD . Guess they were making room for the replacements . - We were only dead three days . - How quickly they forget . Not everyone forgets . Nathan ! Your asses aren 't the only thing West saved . The colonel said we 'd be chipped beef on Chig toast if it wasn 't for you . Heard they were ... gonna take out part of your ... Don 't worry . I 'd still remember you . For a while ... I wasn 't sure . Me , I knew you 'd find us . Otherwise ... you 'd be too ticked off I lost your knife . Saved my life . I wasn 't sure . And I just kept thinkin ' ... about the 61st . I kept thinkin ' ... - Maybe , if I didn 't remember ... - That 's the 61st . You 'd be ... The 61st were dead , and they saved us . Then we were dead , and you saved us . So ain 't nobody forgettin' nobody here they served with ... dead or alive . Mm . No . Let 's go . " O God , whose days are without end ... " make us , we beseech thee , deeply mindful ... " of the shortness and uncertainty of human life ... " that when we have served thee in our generation ... " we may be gathered unto our fathers ... " having the testimony of a good conscience . " We pray that the memory of our comrades fallen in battle ... " may be ever sacred in our hearts ... " that the sacrifice which they have offered for our planet 's cause ... " may be acceptable in thy sight . " Unto Almighty God we commend the souls of our brothers and sisters departed ... and commit their bodies to the deep of space . " Detail , atten-hut ! Present arms ! Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

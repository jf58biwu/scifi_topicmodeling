 How was that ? - Morning , Steed . - Would you help me ? Did you bring me to be your gun bearer ? I want you to meet Willy Fair , a top agent , now in traffiic control . Traffiic control ? For incoming spies . He helps set them up . - and we should meet ? - He had an accident . His pram ... My lunchtime refreshment ! - His pram ran away ? - a good beer in orbit ... In the pram was a dead man in a tux . What does Fair say ? He doesn 't say anything . Not a darn thing . That 's not like Willy ! Usually quite talkative , aren 't you ? Back and forth across the wall like a game of ping-pong . a bit of a countdown from those days . Making you do dreary old disposal work ... Who was he ? The man you were trying to dispose of ? Why the suit ? It could be delayed concussion . Stubborness , that 's all . What about the dead man ? Completely unknown . Here 's his suit . Pockets empty , no labels , recently dry-cleaned . - No clues at all ? - It didn 't fiit him well . The tuxedo . It wasn 't a proper fiit . - Probably hired . - Possibly . Where does that take us ? Our only hope of identifying him : a label they couldn 't remove . Tatooed on his arm . Eros ! That 's the one . My most popular design besides " I love whoever " and " What is home without a mother 's loving touch ? " That 's a lovely thought ! " What is home without ... " Only for big ones . Needs plenty of room . I tried it on a skinny one , once . Disastrous ! Ran out of space . It came out : " What is home without a moth ? " Ridiculous ! Mind you , it spoiled a lovely sentiment . Which design for you ? Well , I ... Engraved garter on the left leg . I enjoy doing them . - No ... - Rosebuds ! Pink rosebuds . One on each . Do you recognize this ? You 're not his wife ? The one with Lucille on his arm . No , I 'm not his wife . Pays to be cautious . Very discreet business . - One guy couldn 't undress ... - You do recognize it . aye , that 's my work all right .

He wasn 't married . Peever . You get to know a lot of folk . You get to knowtheir skin , so to speak . He wasn 't married , I 'm sure . - What 's he done ? - Done ? You 're not asking all these questions for nothing ! He had an accident . a kind of " write off " . It 's Fair . Willy Fair . Listen . We had an accident . They found Peever . We removed his identifiication . But we overlooked ... the tuxedo . It was hired from ... Ludson Company . This is one of our suits , I recognize the cut . The wearer pinned his medals very poorly . Holes . They can 't be invisibly mended . Neither can the wearer . - Do you remember him ? - I flitted him myself . Long in the arm , short in the leg . Unusual . - Who was he ? - Sir ? The customer . Don 't you know ? You do have his suit ! With these holes , we 'll have to keep the deposit . It 's yours . I warned Mr. Peever . For the least damage , you forfeit your deposit . - Peever ... - Sir ? Do you have his address ? Yes , but it 's strictly confiidential information . Not between associates ? - Baggy Pants , Ltd . - Baggy ... ? Top secret . Diplomatic corps only . - Baggy Pants ? - Sh ! Haven 't you seen those Russian diplomats ?

Oh no , sir . a true gentleman ties his tie himself . There are some places , where they simply won 't let ... So terrible ! and just before a race ! We dress the entire nation . Without us , ascot would be nude . - This is your only record ? - Yes . Mr. Peever left a deposit . Is it a cheque ? Very likely . If so , we 'll have the name of his bank . - Would you mind checking ? - Of course . The pockets were empty . Our suits have a secret pocket . - Shoe repair ticket . - For Pie Di 's . No ordinary shoe repair then . Pie Di 's is the most exclusive . Everything 's handmade . Pale . Slender . Exquisitely elegant . Signora , they 're a poem . They sing and soar ... Santa Lucia ...

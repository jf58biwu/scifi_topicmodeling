 You know , you really don 't have to squeeze them that hard . He 's right . It 's probably why she kicked you . Cows are very sensitive . Never again . I 'm not cut out for farm work . I like my milk in a bottle , or a cow with a special sauce , pickles , cheese , onions ... On a sesame seed bun . Well , it looks like another abandoned world , kids . Well , we 're only here for eight hours . That 's long enough for me . Well , there 's no population problem . You guys ever been to an abandoned world before ? It happens . It 's usually not that good . Usually it 's not abandoned . Hey ! Excuse me ? Ma 'am ? Excuse me ? Hello ? Hello ? Story of my life . Hi ... Oh , goodbye ! What , is this a Michael Jackson video ? Whoa ! Guys , why don 't we head to the Chandler ? Good idea . Yeah . Where 's Wes Craven ? Oh , what is this , Scream 3 ? Let 's see if they got a room . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Wow . Whatever those things were out there they didn 't follow us in . How did we get in here ? Through the door , I guess . Well , did you open it ? Good afternoon and welcome to the Chandler Resort Spa . My name is Archibald Chandler , founder , owner , manager . Wait a minute , all of those hotels . I never knew that there was a Chandler . We 'd love a room for the night . We 're just passing through . Oh , your usual suite is ready for you . And as for just passing through , well , we shall see . Our usual suite ? 1215 , Mr. Brown . You 'll find your mini-bar stocked with your favorite soda . Miss Beckett , I 'm sure you 'll appreciate the wardrobe that 's been selected for you . It 's all in your suite . And there is a full array of athletic activities and complete equipment , so that you , Mr. Mallory and your brother , should have no trouble in staying in peak condition . Wait a minute . How do you know us ? Oh , my hotel has a very sophisticated computer system . This is all fine and dandy . But we 're just a little short on cash . If we could just get a simple room . No , I wouldn 't hear of it . Besides , your cash is no good here . You mean everything 's free ? Nothing in life is free , Miss Beckett , but there is no charge for your room and service in this hotel . At least not in the traditional sense . Now , here is a copy of the schedule of the week 's activities and on the back you will find a list of our rules and regulations . We can 't run a hotel without rules and regulations , now can we ? Enjoy your stay at the Chandler . Thank you . What the devil is going on ? Okay , there 's no charge , but nothing is free . What does that mean ? I don 't care how sophisticated his computer system is . He knows too much about us . Well , let 's see if the bar is free . I could really use a drink . Your usuals ? You know what we want ? Of course . Maybe you 've been here before . Oh , no , I was thinking about that . I think we would remember if we met Mr. Chandler . Okay , here are the rules . " Proper dress and decorum in all public places . " No belts with suspenders . " No bow ties , no hats . " Pretty specific dress code . " No bouffant hairdos for the ladies . " Fine with me . " No blue eye shadow . " What ? Okay , come on . These aren 't rules , these are pet peeves . What kind of a place is this ? Oh ! Almost forgot the umbrella there , Mr. Mallory . Hey , buddy , let me ask you something . Hey , call me Jake ! Okay , Jake . Before we came in here , outside , there were people walking around . People ? More like zombies . Oh ! Yes . The empties . We call them the empties . Nothing up here , get it ? Nasty things . But don 't worry about them . What happened to them ? Who knows ? But don 't worry . They won 't come in here . Mr. Chandler has very strict rules . Check this out . " Do not pop your knuckles . " Do not use the phrase , " ' Yes , but it 's dry heat . " ' Mr. Chandler has very high standards . Well , there 's a guy who 's not abiding by the rules . Where ? There was a little guy right there . He had a black bag . Quinn , you 're supposed to finish your beer before you start hallucinating . Oh , come on . Look , I have no objections to a few rules . You know , keeping everything running right . But this one I just can 't go along with . " No singing in public places . " Look , I used to make a pretty good living doing that . Actually , that 's one of the biggies . Mr. Chandler has perfect pitch and if a singer is just slightly off-key , it 's like nails on a blackboard to him . So ... Well , I 've got perfect pitch . I mean , check this out . No , no , look ... Who 's gonna stop me ? No . Cry like a man Mr. Brown , please ! Hard as I can Rembrandt ! Remmy ? Remmy , you all right ? Remmy , what 's wrong ? Just lost my breath there for a minute . Well , let 's get him up to the room , okay ? Yeah . You should lie down . Come on . Wow ! They weren 't kidding about wardrobe . Look at this . Remmy , you okay ? Yeah , yeah . I think so . It felt like somebody had their hands around my throat . Guys , check this out . I had a dream . A dream that advanced technology was the key to a peaceful existence . And now , the result is all around you . Here in the Chandler Resort every desire and need is met . No crime . No violence . No unhappiness . No blue eye shadow . How much time we got ? A little more than seven hours . Well , at least we 'll look sharp . Yeah . Well , there 's something not right about it . Everybody in here is perfect . Everybody out there is empty . Look . Walled up . They don 't want us to see outside ? Or anyone to see in . Hey , Remmy , do you remember where the roof is ? Yeah , if it 's the same as always . Well , we better go check it out . You two wait here . Okay . Why don 't you keep an eye out down here ? Give me a shout if anybody 's going up . I see you 're still curious about the outside world . Of course , it 's not really there . Well , at least it 's there . Somewhere out there . But what you see now is what I let you see . Are you sure you want to see it ? Take these and look down there . Oh , my God . That thing out there looks like me . What is this place ? Look , why don 't we talk in my office ? Nothing in this hotel is real . I should have known that you , of all people , would pick up on my little idea . Would you take a look at your hand ? Now , you 're a part of the hotel , too . Hey , Q-Ball ! What 's going on , man ? Hey , Q-Ball ! Q - Ball ! Damn , where 'd the boy go ? Hey , did Quinn come in here ? No . I thought he was with you ? He was . He went to check out the situation up on the roof . I waited for him at the stairs and then I went up and he was gone . We 've got to get out of here . Where the devil were you ? I 'm not exactly sure . I 'll tell you everything I know on the way , but we have got to go . What happened to the door ? All right . Let 's try the back way . Chandler was up there . On the roof ? No . In his office . I mean , he was on the roof and then we were in his office . Hey , folks , where are you going ? Freaky bartender . Look , how did you get past me on the stairs ? I was relocated . What does that mean ? I don 't understand it very well yet , but I think we 're inside of some kind of computer . What are you talking about ? This is a hotel . Hey ! I missed you . Want another soda ? This is way too weird . Let 's try the basement because on some worlds , there 's an elevator that goes down to the sidewalk outside . See you in a minute . Uh-huh . How can we be in a computer ? I mean , we are here , aren 't we ? This is us , right ? He may be a virtual , and as for us I do not know yet . What are we doing back here ? We went downstairs over there but we didn 't come up any over here . Hey ! Welcome back ! Somehow this guy Chandler has created an entire virtual environment and we 're a part of it . When I was on the roof , I saw myself . What ? Remember what the bartender called an empty ? Well , I 'm pretty sure that I 'm one of them . Actually , I 'm pretty sure that we all are . Only six hours to go . But is this really the timer ? And is this really counting down to the slide ? The real timer could be on my empty , somewhere out there . Who knows what the real time is ? I can 't be sure of anything . Q - Ball , we 've been through wars , plagues and all kinds of greatly warped situations . But this takes the virtual cake . Are you sure you 're not running some kind of fever ? Your brother 's absolutely right . How you doing ? I 'm Quinn . The name is Mac . And the game is staying out of Archibald Chandler 's virtual plan . Can you help us ? Tell us what 's going on around here ? I probably could . But not at the moment . I 'll be in touch . I couldn 't help noticing that you had to satisfy yourselves there was no way out . Yeah , well , we 'll find a way out . You could bet on that . Well , no one ever has . No one ever will . Now , why don 't you just accept that and enjoy what we do have here . Well , I see that two of you at least have taken advantage of the amenities . Absolutely charming , Miss Beckett . I don 't know what the game is here yet . But believe me , we don 't want to play . Well , don 't decide that quite yet . A game may be just what you need . Now , why don 't you join me again in my office , Mr. Mallory ? Oh , and , please , bring your friends with you . " Oh , and , please , bring your friends with you . " Your friend Quinn is beginning to understand that this hotel is a digital representation . A very sophisticated computer environment . Everything you see exists as pure data , not as matter . Now tell them the good part . The same thing applies to yourselves . Meaning what ? When you made your entrance into the lobby , you were scanned in . Most of your neural patterns were translated into binary code . Your bodies were measured and digital models automatically rendered . You exist in the same way that this hotel exists . I don 't care how or why you built this place but we don 't want to stay . But look around you . I mean , everyone is happy here . My friends , this is nothing short of utopia . My dear , you will never get sick in here , you will never get hurt in here . You will have an endless wardrobe . And best of all , you won 't age a single day . Now think what millions would give . Well , give millions to be in such a perfect place . So when Quinn saw himself on the roof , he was a ... An empty . Exactly . Oh , you four , you have your empties stumbling around out there , somewhere . But I don 't . I exist as pure data . Well , you 're quite welcome here . And if you follow the rules , you can take advantage of any of our services . But please don 't waste your time trying to leave , will you ? I see that you play chess . You noticed . Yes . It 's one of my passions . Why , do you play ? Bobby Fischer was my idol . Oh , well then we might enjoy a game sometime . Challenging opponents are hard to find . It 'd be my pleasure . What was that all about ? Yeah , playing chess with that guy ? I 'm just buying some time . We gotta find that little guy . What was his name ? Mac . He 's got the keyboard . It could be our only way out of here . What 's going on ? Where are we ? You 're in the junk directory . Home of deleted files . A good place to hide . And how did we get here ? He just changed our location to this directory . Very good . I put these together from junk I found down here . So far this is the state of what I like to call my art . You 're not like the others . You don 't even dress like them . I like to be comfortable . Besides , I 'm just good at staying out of Chandler 's way . I recommend you do the same . You 're just binary code now . He doesn 't like something , he 'll just change it to suit him . Or delete it . Write over you , you 'll be dead . How can he have that much power ? We gave it to him . He created this resort as a haven when the anti-tech movement started a few years back . I 'm a hacker . People like me needed a place to go . Place seemed like heaven at first . So what happened ? We got lazy . Like here , it was too easy . That touch screen of his used to be only be used for emergencies . Maintenance . He got so many requests to fix this , change that . He just started controlling the environment at will . Decided to make it just the way he wanted it . That 's why all those rules . Everybody here is afraid to think a bad thought . Don 't tell me he can read minds . If he wanted to , he could probably be your mind . He 's right . Think the wrong thing , he might even give you a headache or worse . So he caused you to choke when you sang . That 's right . It 's a good thing you don 't use blue eye shadow . But you said you were a hacker . Isn 't there something you could do to protect yourself ? Go offline ? There is no offline . Everything is virtual here . We 're just icons . I pieced this together from the discard file . It can do a few things , but it can 't compare with Chandler 's rig . This is his world , man . We just live in it the best we can . Maybe it 's time to change that . Look , I already went head to head with this guy . I 'm not about to make the same mistake . Well , hey ! Wait a minute ! Hang on a second . We can 't go up against him by ourselves . At least you have the know-how , the technology . And if you can 't make your rig strong enough to fight Chandler , we have somebody who may be able to . Not a chance . Trust me . Just lie low . And enjoy what 's left of your life . Whoa ! Wait a minute ! How are we supposed to get back ? Just start walking . All directions lead back to the lobby . What do we do now ? Well , at least we got a computer . Well , can you make it work ? I think so . Mr. Chandler loves his little rules and regulations . Let 's see if I can make some changes . All right , Colin , what do they say now ? " All men must wear bow ties . " Blue eye shadow is required . " Everyone must sing in public places . " Give it a shot , Remmy . Hey , yeah , Rem . Come on . No way . Come on , Remmy . Come on , Rembrandt . All right . All right . I 'm sinking In an ocean of tears Not bad , huh ? And I feel like I 've been singing for years Yeah ! Take that , Mr. Chandler ! Yes ! All right , guys , we 've got four hours to figure out a way out of here in time to slide . None of you is going anywhere . What 's happening ? I don 't know . I 'm stuck . I can 't move my feet . I see my little friend , Mac , has been in touch with you . He was only trying to help us . Mac is a troublemaker but he is fairly harmless . I let him roam through the junk files simply because it amuses me . But I had expected better of you . I was even beginning to like you . And as for you , when I say no singing , that 's exactly what I mean . Look , you have no right to tell me what to do . You 're choking him ! He 's sorry . He 'll stop singing ! If you hurt him , so help me God , I will kill ... This is a peaceful resort . Violence of any kind is strictly prohibited here . And you , young lady , no longer have a place here . And when things have no place here , I simply delete them . Maggie . In fact , none of you belong here . She 's gone . Where is she ? You bring her back right now ! Oh , no , that 's not possible . Well , you 'd better make it possible . Why should I ? You 're all so dreadfully noisy . He can 't . There 's no undelete command in the system . At least I didn 't see it . Mr. Mallory is quite correct . If I let you speak , will you promise to behave quietly ? Mr. Chandler , I vehemently apologize for our behavior and I promise that we will obey all of your rules from now on . Now , fellows , this is Mr. Chandler 's hotel and there is nothing we can do to change that . There is nothing we can do to bring Maggie back . We just have to live with and accept that . We should do nothing to threaten our deletion . Well spoken , Mr. Mallory . Very well , you can stay . But always remember I shall be watching you . Perhaps it 's time for that game of chess we discussed . As you wish . Very well . I 'll be expecting you . Have you lost your mind ? This is the part where my brother always has a plan . You do have a plan , don 't you ? He didn 't kill Maggie because she doesn 't exist . None of us do . Look , I 'm not following you . But that 's not news . I think I can get her back and get us all back into our bodies . If I can only get deeper into the system . Now , this chess game might be my chance for that . Now , I 'm going to distract him while you guys go and find Mac and see if he will help us out . Come in . Oh , Mr. Mallory , I 'm so glad you could join me . Would you forgive me for a moment while I just iron out a few glitches ? So your little world isn 't so perfect . Well , no world is , really . But this one comes very close . From time to time any computer will develop little variants . Sometimes I think this has a mind of its own . Needs constant maintenance . Shall we play ? Now , as you are my guest , why don 't you play white ? Pretty cool . Traditional opening . Just wait and see . Petroff . Kieseritsky played black . Paris , 1845 . I would have said 1846 . Pretty ambitious . Oh , I always think big , Mr. Mallory . You know , we spoke before of utopia . Down through the ages , man has tried and failed to create such a thing . Utopia comes from the Greek , meaning " no place . " This perfect world exists simply because it doesn 't exist at all . Almost perfect world . I would 've thought pawn to queen three was a compulsory move there . I like to work without a net . Try and talk now . Boy , Chandler really did a number on you . That 's not all he did . He deleted Maggie . I 'm sorry . Try talking now . What ? What is this ? I don 't sound anything like this . Yes . That 's it ! That 's it right there . Okay . Yeah . Would you care for a dish of tea ? I 'm fine . It is Earl Grey and Ceylon . A perfect combination . It was one of the first things I saw to . You said before that you did not have an empty on the outside world . In your world , have you heard of a Spanish explorer named Cortez who conquered Mexico ? Yes . When Cortez landed in Veracruz , he burned all his ships in the harbor to show his men there was no way back . I destroyed all my bodily containers when I created this world . Everything I want , everything I need is right here . You should 've seen that , Mr. Mallory . I saw it . Quinn 's gone to play chess with Chandler . Do you think we can look in on them ? Sure . I don 't get this . It 's just a game . He said he might get a way to get deeper into Chandler 's system . I doubt it . All his personal files are protected from invasion . Well , if they can be invaded , Q - Ball 's the guy that can do it . Something wrong , Mr. Mallory ? No , I 'm fine . I was curious about something you have . It appears to be a timing device of some sort . How did you know that ? Oh , I already know a great deal about you and your friends , and , of course , the longer you stay here , the more time I shall have to learn even more . What 's wrong with my brother ? He 's starting to look a little queasy . It 's bound to happen . Chandler 's getting into his mind . Thanks to you , my timer is no good to anyone . Like everything else in this world , it 's a useless digital representation . I 'm intrigued by its design . It seems capable of producing a gravitational rift . Perhaps a rift powerful enough to create and function as a gateway . Where does it go ? Hey , Quinn ? Another star system ? Another universe perhaps ? What we do , what we used to do , it 's called " sliding . " And it is something that you will never , ever be able to do as long as you exist only as data . Oh , that 's where you 're wrong , Mr. Mallory . You see , I can explore those worlds through you . What are you doing to me ? I 'm downloading your memory , Mr. Mallory . I shall be able to see everything you 've seen . Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! You 've gotta do something . Maybe I can write an encryption . What would that do ? Lt 'll put your files in a code so that Chandler can 't get to it . Just for a time , though . Eventually , he 'll crack the code and we 'll be back where we started . It 's better than nothing . Access denied . Encrypted file . Now , let 's see if we can get him down here with us . How much time have we got ? Not much . But I 'll hold him off as long as I can . But he 's got power on his side . All right . Well , we 've got to find Maggie . How ? I mean , Mac says she 's gone . The entry to the files is right there . She was deleted less than an hour ago . She can 't be that far . I 'm sorry to bring you from your work but I do need your help . One of the files has got out of control in the system . A virus ? Oh , no , no , nothing like that . But I do need you to run a search and rein in our new citizens . Oh , no , not again , Mr. Chandler . Now let me see . What icon shall I select ? How about Thor ? Thor ? Do I have to ? You remember the last time . Good . Now go to work , will you ? Look , if we do find her , how do we know it 's Maggie ? I don 't know . But I 'm hoping that we recognize something . Just keep looking . Chandler 's trying to hack in on our encryption code . No , you have got to hold him off . I 'm picking up some weird data . Looks like he 's sending someone after us . Who ? I 'm not sure yet . But they 're awfully big files . Guys , I found her . Yeah , that 's Maggie . But what do we do with her ? Chandler has compressed her . I need to find a decompression program in here . Okay . Okay , I 'm getting close . I 'm getting close . I 've got her . Whoa ! You look good , Maggie . What did you do ? Yeah , Quinn , what did you do ? I think what happened is that Chandler cracked Rembrandt 's code at the same moment I was re-digitizing Maggie . Yeah , so ... What do we do now ? Does this mean that Chandler still controls me ? Not at the moment . I 'll give you a new code . But time 's pretty short in here . Okay , boy genius , what 's the plan ? No offense , Remmy , but I don 't want to go through the rest of my life like this . I 've heard of getting in touch with your feminine side , but this is too much . All right , I just have to reconfigure Maggie 's icon . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hold on there , now . Wait a minute . Now wait till Quinn figures something out . Until he does , you just keep your hands to yourself . I mean , keep your hands off yourself . What 's the matter , Remmy ? Got some secrets you don 't want me to know about ? Yeah , you doggone straight . All right . All right . All right . This should do it . Good to have you back ! It is good to be back . No offense , Rem , but I just prefer my own body . Me too , Maggie ! Uh-oh ! What ? What is it ? We better find a better place to hide . Well , what is he doing ? He 's sending Thor and Freya . A couple of combat action figures . He calls them from time to time to take care of programs that misbehave . Well , why wouldn 't he just delete us like he did Maggie ? I guess he just enjoys watching his gangsters beat up on people . Come on , I 've got to find an out-of-the-way directory we can hide in . No , no , no , no , no . We can 't hide from Chandler forever . We could try . I told you , it 's crazy to go up against this guy . No , no , no . Listen , we have got to go up against this guy . It 's the only chance my friends and I have of getting out of this place . You are really asking for it . Me , I 'm going undercover . No , you are coming with us because I need you on that keyboard . Against Chandler ? Yes . There 's only one sure way to lose to this guy . And that is not to fight him . We gotta do something . We 've gotta help him . Okay , okay , okay . Mac , a little help ! Give him some weapons or something ! Weapons ? Okay . Good . There . Sword ! Okay , I guess I want a hammer . Oh ! If he ain 't kosher , this ain 't gonna stop him . No , hammer , hammer ! I only heard " ham . " Come on , Thor , you can show them . Come on , Mac ! I said , " Hammer , " man ! Rembrandt , you all right ? Splendid ! Get him , farm boy , get him ! Come on , now . Careful . Careful . Colin , watch out ! Help him ! Do something ! I 'm going ! Colin ! Yes ! Damn ! Come on , now . Yes ! Damn ! Right ! Where did you learn to fight like that ? Thanks for the sword , Mac . Yeah , and the ham . It worked . Damnation ! This one is mine ! Hold on ! Not yet ! Get her , Maggie ! Never the face , bitch ! Very nice . I 'm not doing it . Damn ! Yes ! Come on . We gotta get out of here ! Okay , now , to get us outside and back into our bodies . There 's got to be a way to break this link . Well , if they want a fight , they 're certainly going to get it . Yeah , baby . Okay , that should do it . We 'll all be out of here in a second . What about Chandler ? Won 't he come after us ? He told me he destroyed his empty . When I disconnect him here , he 's gone for good . All right . Checkmate . Mr. Mallory , you win . Hey ! Holy smoke ! Holy smoke ! Guys , get up . Get up , guys ! Get up ! Five more minutes , Mom . No , no , no , we don 't have five minutes ! We slide in seven seconds ! Get up ! How did we pass out like that ? I don 't know . But we almost missed the slide ! I feel a whole lot better . Sliding makes me sleepy . Did you just have a really weird dream ? Where have I seen those guys before ?

 Day 109 , our 40th day stuck in the biodome . Food is getting more and more scarce . Each day , we venture out in the cold , in hopes of finding edible plant life , with little luck . The planet that once seemed so abundant is now a frozen wasteland . All signs oflife have disappeared . Danziger ! Danziger . ! Danziger ? Danziger ! Walman ? Danziger , get over here . ! Hey . Careful , please . Amazing . Looks like the perfect specimen . An entire Terrian body frozen in place like that ? Probably from a distant glacier . Hey , you okay , Baines ? How long do you think it 's been preserving in there like that ? I won 't know till I do a full bioscan , butjudging from its position , it looks like it froze almost instantly , like cryogenic preservation , so it could be almost any age . That shankin ' Grendler 's been wailing ' all afternoon . Okay , everybody clear . Walman , get in there and steady it . Let 's get this piece of ice off the ground . What 's his problem ? Okay , Danziger . Step back . Ready ? All right , go slow now . Easy . Easy . All right . It 's looking good down here . Nice and easy . Keep goin ' . - Slow . - Hey , hey . Hey , hey , hey . ! Watch out . ! Shank ! Damn it , Julia . What 'd I tell you ? You okay ? That 's enough . It 's subzero . We got better things to do than to haul around this ice cube . What , are you suggesting we abandon it ? We burned out the trans-rover 's winch . Let 's just leave it and cut our losses , okay ? Danziger , I can 't ignore information about this planet . This is major . It 's gonna answer questions , possible disease immunities . We are here long term . Yeah ? Our food supply says different . We got two weeks . No food was brought to camp that day . But the body was , set up in a tent outside . We called it " the alien tent . " Stop . So what do you think it is ? I don 't know , but it could be a key to understanding this planet . 300,000 years old . Yeah . What 's most unbelievable is the cell structure of this Terrian . Seems to have much more in common with us . Humans ? Terrians now have a more plantlike composition , given that their nutrients are absorbed by osmosis ... and their symbiotic relationship with the planet . Does that mean ... one day we 'll be evolving to be more like Terrians ? I don 't know , but it 's fascinating . Oh , my God . What do you think they 're doing in there , Dad ? I don 't know , but unless they 're planning on serving ' that carcass for dinner , I think they 're wasting their time . Hey , True . If you wanna go check it out , I 'll help your dad . Okay ? Please , Dad ? I 'll only be a minute . All right . Go . One minute , but that 's it . You hear me ? Yeah . Okay . So why aren 't you in there with the rest of 'em ? I 'm not much for dead things . It 's definite . I 'm registering a weak but very present field of electrical activity from what would be the cerebellum . But that - It is dead , correct ? Mom . It 's all right , Uly . It 's all right . There 's nothing to be afraid of . Right ? No , Uly . Don 't be afraid . It 's exciting . The preservation is so incredible , and with traces of psychic energy , if I can isolate it , maybe we can find out once and for all how they communicate through their dreams . All right . Let 's , uh - Let 's letJulia do her work . Okay ? Come on . Do you think he died like that ? Yeah , I think so . I know how he feels . Trapped . My first cold sleep , for some reason , I woke up in my capsule five days early . And I couldn 't get back to sleep . And I couldn 't get out . I was locked in there , half frozen , like a coffin . I never dreamt again . Damn . I slept bad last night . I couldn 't get that frozen creature out of my head . See , Bess ? Bess , it wasn 't just because I was hungry . You dreamt him too ? Yes , all night . Nightmares . Me and the thing , we were - You were wrestling ? Yes , exactly . You too ? I thought it was just because I was coming down with something . It 's probably from being out in the cold so long yesterday . That still doesn 't explain the nightmares . They could be fever-induced . And you-you saw something very frightening yesterday . But we all had the same one , and it sure didn 't feel like a regular nightmare . - And what about that-that energy field ? - Yeah . What if - Oh , my God . What if your diaglove didn 't detect some spores from a bazillion years ago ? Who knows what kind of deadly microbes could have been released ? Everybody relax . Honestly , you 're more childish than my daughter . I had a dream too . It was no big deal . What you should be worried about here is how we 're gonna feed ourself this time next week . I 'll be loading the dune-rail for a scout . Hey , Danziger . What ? I just wanted to thank you for talking some sense in there . Just stop . People in there are sick and hungry . Our minds aren 't workin 'right . Don 't make the mistake of thinking we 're on the same team on this one . Hey , Danziger . You can tell everyone to stop panicking . The energy is now gone . The Terrian is 100 % dead . Hey , hey , hey . ! Whoa . Watch it , Baines . Put the gun down . It 's me . I 'm here to spell you , okay ? Walman , you were supposed to call out . Huh . You 're not lookin ' so good . What 's g - What 's goin ' on out here ? Nothing . It 's just dead out here . So shankin ' frigid . The wind 's been playin ' tricks on me or something . I don 't know . Energy or no energy , Ice Cube Harry in there is freakin ' me out . Who knows what we 're defrostin ' in there ? I think you 've been out here pacing too long , man . Go get some rest . Amazingly , 60 % of the tissue has been preserved . Inferences that can be drawn at this point about the creature 's biology and lifestyle : First , definitely bipedal . Second , unlike Terrians that we 've encountered so far , this specimen possesses a spinal column and multiple vertebra . And although more diminutive , residual muscle tissue still indicates great strength . Hi . Is he gonna come alive ? He ? Well , first of all , it 's neither a he nor a she . And second of all , I hate to disappoint everyone , but , no , it 's not coming alive . It 's dead . That 's the radiometer . What 'd you do to it ? Nothing . I just found it there . All right . Has anybody been in the tent ? Maybe somebody knocked it off the table accidentally . This is not an accident . Someone did this . I don 't think this thing can be salvaged . They broke the monitor too . - I 'll get Danziger . Let 's not make a bigger deal out of this than we have to . Things do break around here all the time . Yeah , but I 'm telling you . It was spooky out there . Look , Baines felt it too . The wind ... and that Grendler , howling . - Maybe the Grendler destroyed it . - I don 't think so . The Grendler seemed pretty far away . It felt more like it was tryin ' to - I don 't know-warn me or something . You were the one out there , Walman . Why don 't you tell us what really happened ? What are you getting at ? Why would I wanna vandalize the gear ? I don 't know . You tell me . Morgan , please . - Maybe I 'll just say it was you out there , Morgan . - What 's the problem , people ? Oh , my God . All right , everybody . Just get back inside . Come on . Everybody inside . Hurry up . - The children are inside . Danziger ? - Yes . - Martins ? - Yeah , here . - Alonzo ? - Here . - Walman ? Baines ? - Walman here . Magus ? Magus ? - She 's right here . - All right . Baines ? Baines ? - Baines ? - Oh , my God . Where is he ? - I 'll go check his quarters . - Who saw Baines last ? I , uh - I relieved him about 90 minutes ago . If what got that Grendler got him - Morgan , don 't say that . All right . Here 's what we 're gonna do . Walman , Solace , Cameron , Julia - I want everybody armed . We 're gonna go outside . We 're gonna look for Baines . Preliminary search of the immediate camp . Everybody else , stay inside . Stay back . I 'm not comin ' out . Baines , are you okay ? What 's going on ? What do you mean , what 's going on ? I 'm protecting myself is what 's goin ' on . I mean , something 's out there . That 's why we want you inside , where it 's safe . - How do I know where safe is ? Baines ? Baines , everything 's gonna be okay . Now maybe , uh - maybe you could help us . When you were on sentry , did you go into the alien tent , maybe - maybe bump into the lab table accidentally ? You couldn 't drag me near that tent , Devon . Baines , there is nothing to be concerned about . Oh , no ? Then what about that Grendler ? I mean , Grendlers just don 't implode like that , Yale . There 's seriously something out there . All right , then why don 't you come out and go inside where it 's warm ? If that 's where you feel safe , Devon , you go . I 'm staying right here . Vehicle , secure . What 's happening ? What 's he doing out there ? He 's fine . Baines is fine , just ... very frightened . Somehow he feels safer in the trans-rover right now . It 's that frozen carcass out there , isn 't it ? We should get rid of it . Look , a lot of weird things have happened since we got to this planet . We don 't know that all these things are connected , and that carcass out there is of vital importance to our existence here . Let 's notjump to conclusions , okay ? It 's been a very long day . We 're all tired . Why don 't we try and get some rest and we 'll deal with this in the morning , okay ? Devon 's right . It 's late . We 'll have a better picture in the morning . How are we supposed to sleep , knowing there might be something out there ? Everything will be okay , Morgan . We 'll all stay in here tonight . Hey ! Wake up ! Wake up . Is everyone here ? What is it ? It 's gone . What ? The Terrian body is gone . I 've just been in there , and there 's tracks in the snow . It 's not there . Julia , my dad 's gone . Danziger . ! Hey . ! Hey , what 's goin 'on out there ? Danziger . ! Baines , did you see anything ? Do you know where Danziger is ? Do you know what happened to the Terrian body ? What are you talking about ? I didn 't see anything . I fell asleep . Come on , Baines . No more games . Have you seen Danziger ? Hey , I didn 't see jack squat ! Now all you guys just stay back ! Stay back . ! Show us those tracks , Julia . Do you - Do you smell that ? Oh . Look , there . Something 's burning . God , it 's awful . Don 't breathe too deeply . Let 's go . Everything 's okay now . I burned it . The Terrian didn 't belong with us . I 'm sorry , Julia . It had to go . Now we can all get some sleep . What is going on ? What ? What 's going on ? Why is it so freezing in here ? Something destroyed the generator last night . Our backup 's only at 50 % , and it 's dropped 25 degrees in here already . And none of our crew seems to have had anything to do with it . Just another coincidence , Julia ? Or are you finally going to admit that the iceman shouldn 't have cometh ? Look , we don 't even have the body anymore . Danziger destroyed it for us last night . Everyone , Julia knows that people are frightened ... and that there might be something out there that 's terrorizing us , but please - But what ? Wh-What could it be ? I don 't know . I - I know it 's not the ashes of the creature getting together and - But what if it was the Terrians ? Perhaps by excavating that grave , we disturbed a local tribe . I mean , I certainly would be perturbed ... if I heard that someone had dug up my grandfather . Where you going , Adair ? Alonzo 's not getting anything from the Terrians . No information , nothing . He can 't even reach them . Yeah , so ? So ... we can 't just sit here waiting until whatever 's out there decides to attack one of us . And what exactly do you think is out there ? Penal colonists ? Council operative , maybe ? No , I think we 've upset the balance of nature somehow . And I think we 're in danger . You must have felt the same way too . - Otherwise , why would you have burned that corpse last night ? - So what do we do ? Want to come with me ? I 'm gonna check the coordinates . We 've still got a way , as far as I can tell . Rail 's not getting any sun . We 're just gonna make it back to camp as it is , with the power we got . It 's this way . We 're gonna have to go by foot . Come on . Easy . Whoa . Hey . We 're at the right coordinates , but I don 't recognize it . Do you ? I don 't know . I don 't remember . Adair , camp . Adair to camp . Alonzo , do you read me ? Yeah , I think we 're in the right vicinity . Coordinates are 20 north , 17 west . Do we match ? Alonzo ? Wait a minute . Alonzo - I think we 're in the right place . You should have come in through the mountain entrance . Lucky I found you at all . The elders have been expecting you . We were hoping you 'd come back . Devon . Hi . It 's good to see you . John ? How are you , sir ? Missed you . But that 's not why you 're here . How do you know ? Look at you . You 're terrified . Something very wrong has happened . Now tell me what it is . Okay . Two days ago , a scouting troop from our camp went out to forage for food , and our doctor , Julia , discovered what ... seemed to be an ancient Terrian frozen in a block of ice . We think it was 300,000 years old . She excavated it and brought it back to our camp . - You brought it back ? - Believe me , against my wishes . She thought that the scientific knowledge that could be gained from it would be invaluable . And what did you discover ? Something about its biology . It was very similar to ours . And-And there was some kind of energy within it . - Some kind of life , you mean ? - I guess . I don 't know . Everything happened so fast , and then ... very strange things started to happen . What sort of things ? Instruments smashed , Grendler ripped open right outside our camp . - Our generator was destroyed . - Do you have any idea what this could be ... or who could be causing this ? Could ... it possibly be the Terrians , and maybe they 're angry that we excavated the body ? No . The Terrians wouldn 't want anything to do with that body . - What do you mean ? - Eons ago , the Terrians were much more ... individuated than we know them today . They were subject to - to passion , to rage , emotions . The Terrians believed that all these primordial aspects of their being ... were frozen into one single Terrian , who was swallowed by the earth . - What do you mean , swallowed ? - Just as it sounds . I thought it was folklore traded by the Grendlers , this tale of one single Terrian whom the earth took back . The Grendler was trying to warn us . Where is the body now ? We-We must have it . Uh - Danziger cremated it . It couldn 't stay with us . It was driving us crazy . And-And the - the energy from this body ? You destroyed that too ? No , uh - Actually , it was gone yesterday , be-before all these strange things started to happen . - Why ? - What if it 's not gone ? What , you th-You think this energy just picked up all by itself and eviscerated a Grendler ? I think the energy ... is searching for a new host . You see , the Grendler couldn 't contain it . It must have found another form . What , a human form ? Someone in your group . You know that since we got here , I don 't think I 've ever felt so isolated ? Everyone 's out there guarding themselves . Yale 's practically holding the children prisoner . You 're not giving in to this paranoia yourself , are you ? 'Cause if you are , you can always curl up next to Baines in the trans-rover . I feel it 's best to take precautions . They 're back . ! The dune-rail 's back . ! Thank God you made it safely . Find out anything ? Get everybody together . We got an announcement to make . Okay , everybody . Here 's the situation . We have reason to believe that the psychic energy field from the Terrian corpse ... has somehow found a host . - A host ? - What do you mean another host ? - One of us , Martin . - That 's ridiculous . No , it 's not . Now we have to go about this simply and methodically . Danziger has devised a way to test for the presence of the psychic energy field amongst us . - How ? The radiometer 's smashed . - I figured a way to jerry-rig it . Wait a second . Are you saying that one of us is possessed and walking around ? Or locked in the trans-rover ? It 's hard to even tell if this person is even aware that this psychic energy is within them . I don 't know . I mean , Baines wouldn 't have locked himself in ifhe weren 't feeling something . Everybody , please . Please stay calm . Everybody is getting tested . That includes Baines , even if I have to drag him out of the trans-rover myself . Would you stop that , Cameron ? Oh , God . What if it is me ? You 'd lock me up , right ? Y - You 'd make sure that I didn 't hurt anyone , or worse , hurt myself . Huh ? Um - It 's not me . I don 't think so . I 'd know . Are you sure that thing 's even accurate ? No one 's trying to hurt anyone , Morgan . We are just trying to determine who 's got it , so we can help them . Oh . Is that why he 's got that sedaderm in his belt over there , to help ? Is that part of the plan ? I got no plans for you , man . Thank you for cooperating , Morgan . You 're clear . Oh , I am . Oh , thank God . Well , I knew it couldn 't be me . Thanks very much . Good luck , and , uh - Fine , thanks . I - I need some water . Morgan . It 's okay . Come on . Oh . Thank - What do you think ? How should I know ? It 's just pretend . Radiometer doesn 't really work . Just wish I could have fixed the damn thing . Let 's just pray it 'll be able to smoke out whoever actually is the host . He didn 't seem any different than the Morgan Martin we 've come to know and love . Let 's bring in Solace . Yeah . Hey , not so close . Give me some breathing room , okay ? Take it easy , buddy . We 're all on the same team here . I 'm not the only one who had dreams about him , you know ? You have any of the dreams , Danziger ? - No . Why are you so keyed up , man ? - Is there something you want to tell us , Alonzo ? Why do you think I 'm keyed up ? One of us has been turned into some freakish mutant . Come on . You 're the one with the psychic connection to the Terrians . Why don 't you remind us of your dream ? Maybe it 'll help us out a little bit . I told you everything I know . The thing came at me , and we wrestled . - What ? - This isn 't good , man . I 'm getting some kind of reading here . - What are you saying ? - You think it 's working , Danziger ? You think you 're proving something ? You 're proving nothing . It 's not me . I 'm not the one . This meter doesn 't lie , pal . Just relax . Just relax . We 're here to help . It 's you . You 're the one . Devon , get away . It 's him ! Devon , the sedaderm , now . - Alonzo , it 's okay . We 're not gonna hurt you . - It 's not me . You 're in danger ! Alonzo , he doesn 't want to hurt you . - Danziger , he 's got a knife . - I 'm warning you . Don 't come any closer . ! I mean , Devon , look at him . Look at him . Julia , please tell him to drop the knife . What 's going on ? - It 's Danziger . He 's got it inside him . - Please put down the knife . We 're all very scared . Alonzo . ! Oh , my God . ! Alonzo ! Julia , please wait . Just-Just let him go . No sign of Alonzo to the south . We thought we saw tracks , but they were Grendler prints . Well , come on back to camp . Found his prints heading northeast , but they disappeared in the snow without any heat traces . Northeast . That 's where we were yesterday . That 's where the elder is . Must be headed there to silence him . Check the charge in the rail . - If I leave now , I should be able to cut him off . - What are you planning to do to him ? You 're gonna find him , right ? I plan on helping him , Julia . But this thing inside Alonzo 's made him capable of vandalizing this camp and attacking me . Force may be the only thing this demon understands . Danziger 's right . If we don 't protect ourselves , this thing will take us like it took Alonzo . If it exists . How do we know the elder was right ? - How else do you explain what 's happened ? - Grendlers or penal colonists could have done any of it . - Then why did Alonzo run ? - I don 't - Why don 't you just letJohn go find him , okay ? Fine . I 'm going with him . No . I won 't allow this crew to get taken over one by one . It 's subzero out there . He 's gonna need medical attention - If he needs your help , I 'll call you ! Otheise , you 'rejust risking yourself for no reason . John , Julia 's right . Alonzo may need her help . She 's going with you and so am I. Now let 's go . Please , someone ! Come . Another four kilometers . We 're gonna get him . I can feel it . Julia , make sure that sedaderm 's ready . - I 've never seen you like this , John . - Like what ? I just don 't want you to confuse rescuing Alonzo with hunting an animal . This thing is an animal , Devon . It 's worse than that . It 'll destroy us all if we let it . Oh , he wants you dead , because he knows you 're the only one who can kill him . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about you , Alonzo . How can I kill him ? I don 't even know what he is . I sensed it , the moment you entered . - It 's no accident you and the demon have come face-to-face . - What ? The Terrians tell me ... that your skills on the dream plane are stronger than any human they 've ever known . Why can 't the Terrians fight him ? They lack aggression . It 's not in their nature to fight one of their own . I still don 't understand what this has to do with me . You must battle with the demon on the dreamscape . It 's where he controls your friend , and it 's where you must challenge him . Challenge him ? How can I beat him ? He 'll kill me . He already tried that once , when I was sleeping . But he didn 't yet succeed . And if I can 't ? There 's no more time . He 's here . John ? John . What ? You 're going the wrong way . The elder 's chamber is this way . Looks like I took a wrong turn , huh ? What are you tryin ' to pull ? You can 't get away from me . ! Julia . Devon ? Come back . I won 't hurt you . Devon . ! Please . Please , John . Stay back . I mean it . I mean it . Stay back . Devon , don 't fire ! You 'll killJohn , but the demon won 't die . They told me to return , and somehow I knew . The only way to fight the demon 's anger was to release my own . I could let go and be free - Alonzo ? so the planet 's power flowed through me . Alonzo , is that you ? I think so . Oh . Help me up . Ow . What hurts ? Everything . So we returned to camp , Danziger remembering nothing about the time the demon was inside him . We had to tell him everything . I 'm okay . Good . Alonzo ? Yeah ? Listen , I know it really wasn 't me back there , but all the same , I 'm sorry . Appreciate what you did for me . Forget about it . You would have done the same for me . Know what ? I wouldn 't have . I couldn 't .

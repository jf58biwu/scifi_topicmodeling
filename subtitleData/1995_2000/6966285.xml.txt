 These people are trying way too hard . Jerry , I hired you to handle my art , not me . Aren 't you Edward 's friend ? Ed ? Oh ! Who I consider a waste of human flesh ? As usual , isn 't here . He should be chasing you , not a Nobel Prize . Look , Jerry ... This is my first showing . Don 't add to the pressure . Ed doesn 't appreciate you . I got held up . How 's it going ? Fine ! ( LAUGHS ) Timing is everything . And , as usual , yours sucks . - Where 's the big hand ? - On two . - And the little hand ? - Eleven . So , it 's ... - 1 1 : 1 0 . - He can tell the time ( ! ) But he 's five hours late to something important to me . I 'm sorry ! I do know that . I got a codable sign wave out of a cadaver . Good - a slab of decaying flesh . I 'm digitising the components of memory . Of thought . They 'll be mapped on a neural net in a computer . Computers will house people 's memories , thoughts , and let them live forever . OK . I support your work , whatever it is . I want you to do the same for me . Tell me in ten seconds why I shouldn 't leave you . I can belch the national anthem ? That takes longer than ten seconds . How about this ? That needs more than ten seconds too . Depends on the big hand . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah . CLEARS THROAT Uh ... Yes ? God , I ... I just ... hate to interrupt you , but ... I need you to help me move the goods . People want to meet you . Come on . Do I have to tie you up ? ( SIGHS ) - What ? - I have to go back . - Don 't even think about it . - I made a breakthrough . This isn 't funny anymore . I can 't do this . - That my wine ? - I ... - Thanks . - Yeah . - Thanks . - Anytime , tiger . - Let me help . - Thanks . I need lots of help . - How 's that ? - Good . - You OK ? - Yes . ( SIGHS ) It 's sad when the mind is sharp , but the body 's weak . I ... Fate is such a funny thing . - Good night , Mr Adams . - Good night . How do you know my name ? INSTRUMENTS BEEPING ( SIGHS ) What 's wrong ? I almost tapped into your memory an hour ago . I could see your thoughts as if I had been there myself . Come on . LOUD BEEPING Come on , Travis . Make me see what you see . Surprise , surprise . - Knew I 'd find you here . - Grab a toe-tag . - Make yourself at home . - Oof ! Still doing secret research on these poor bastards ? Without a decent grant , I have to do guerrilla science . I bribe the security guy with a six-pack . Travis Mitchell ? This is so grotesque . Nobody gives a shit . These guys are courtesy of the state prison system . This one 's a serial killer . You 're not interested in the activities of the dead . What do you want ? Remember we used to toss a coin over who gets the girl ? - Could we toss a coin over Britt ? - She 's not mine to toss away . She won 't move on until she 's finished with you , and you only care about this . I can make a difference to humanity . You 'll lose her anyway . Make it easy on all of us - bow out gracefully . Why don 't you let Britt decide ? She 's a big girl . She knows what she can handle . BEEPING Shit ! You are such a prick ! You 'll just give everybody grief , and in the end , nobody wins . Thanks for dropping by , Jer . BEEPING Come on . That 's it . ( SCREAMS ) ( SCREAMS ) " No ! " Oh , my God . ( PANTS ) The rage . - Professor Ellis ! - Edward , hi . Oh , I 'm sorry . The Board turned down your grant . I did everything I could . It was close , but one guy said no and wouldn 't change his mind . We have to convince him . You 'll have to wait till next cycle . I tapped into the memory of a cadaver at the lab ! The top grants went to AIDS research , cancer research and an intercranial pressure device . No money for exotic theories . - But you know how significant this is . - That 's science in the ' 90s . I can 't keep doing pirate research . I need money ! We 'll have to find another way . This will feel cold , but try not to move . How 's it feel ? - Feels kind of sexy . - Yeah , I know . This will take a little time to set , but not too long . Try not to move . I 'll be right back . Officer , he walked in , and I was so scared , I had to shoot him . Six times . I know you 're still mad ... I 'm way past mad . They 'll have to find a new word for what I 'm feeling . Look , I put all my hopes into a grant that fell through . I 'm so close , but with no grant , my work goes up in smoke . I didn 't even know there was a problem . You want me at your beck and call . I need someone I can depend on . - You 're too sensitive . - You know my past . Your father left when you were 1 1 , your mother 's an alcoholic ... What about my brother ? He only shows up when he needs money . I work 20 hours a day . I 'm working till I 'm exhausted . You 're too high maintenance . High maintenance ? Maybe we should explore other options . You mean do-anything-for-sex Jerry ? I don 't know who I mean . At least Jerry 's around to be my friend . DOOR CLOSING Dipshit ! What a day . - Good evening . - Who 's there ! I didn 't mean to frighten you . I won 't harm you . - You were at the party . - Yes . - How 'd you get in ? - Your landlady . Sweet woman . I told her that I was your uncle and had arrived earlier than expected . It 's one of the benefits of being like this . People trust you . You don 't seem to , though . Stay right where you are ! You have nothing to fear . In fact , you have everything to gain . Put down that bat so we can talk . Not until you answer a few of my questions . First ... Why are you here ? And second ... How did you know my name last night ? I 'll answer your questions in time . In time . Now , we don 't want to be late , do we ? - Late for what ? - Dinner . You think I 'll go ? Actually , yes . You look like a virgin on your first date . I hope you 'll be gentle . Not on your life ! If you 're who I think you are , nor will you . If we come to terms , you 'll find it rewarding . What are you talking about ? Relax . I promise this 'll be worth your while . At least you 'll eat well . You 're prepared to give your entire estate , millions , away to a total stranger . It 's my way of living on past my time . What 's the catch ? Ah ... The catch . There 's always a catch . The only stipulation is that upon my death , you will assume my full identity , and continue your research under my name . You may not tell anyone the terms of the agreement . Have you any questions ? This is all so strange . I don 't know where to begin . Well , why not begin at the beginning ? I am ... Everett Longstreet . The Everett Longstreet ? How many people have a name like that ? The Nobel Prize-winner for genetic engineering ? I did share the prize with a colleague . I 'm sorry . This is such a shock . A wonderful shock , but still a shock . I 'm just a sick man in a wheelchair . Your work on the Maskai Shamans from the ' 30s sparked my research . Yes , I know . You know a lot about me . A man of my wealth has intriguing connections . For years , I 've tried to find someone with the obsession , drive , self-determination ... who 'd sacrifice everything for greatness . Someone like myself . So , I began finding out everything I could about you . That make you uncomfortable ? Come . I 'll show you a bit of my past . We 've spent our lives asking the same questions , if not looking for the same answers . Collective thought . The next step in man 's pursuit of immortality . When I was young , I experimented with herbs , and magic potions of the Maskai . I made some progress , but lacked the funds to continue , so I had to move on to other work . Sounds like my situation now . It was such a waste . But now I 'm in a position to change it for you . Well ... Lacking funds is something I do well . Too well . This could be an opportunity that so few people get . The wisdom of age and the energy of youth are so very rarely combined . So far , I 've been able to locate memory neural transmitters , and map them into the neural net . But it 's fragmented , incomplete . I can 't keep the network intact . I can stimulate memory , but only for brief intervals . What do you think is missing ? Well , this is gonna sound crazy , but ... I know I can conform conscious and unconscious thought into the matrix . But the most important element ... I 'm not sure I can reach the soul . Now ... Let me show you something the Maskai Shamans knew about your soul . Would you move the bowl over here ? HISSING Inhale . Take in the smoke . Let it wash over you like a velvet hand . I ... don 't feel anything . That stinks . Come on over here . Take off the cover . Do you play ? Chopsticks . Badly . Sit down . Try it . Go on . # CHOPSTICKS MOZART : Rondo alla turca My mother made me study piano . I hated it . But now I love Mozart like I love my life . It was good to hear myself play again . It was remarkable . It was like being you ! Not just seeing your memory , but being you ! I do have a certain style . I mean , I 've never had any musical ... talents at all . It was amazing to feel my fingers evoke such beauty . It 's a Shaman sideshow trick , but it involves principles at the heart of collective thought . This equipment was to distil the science behind the Shaman 's potions , but I never could get the answer . But I 'm betting that you can . HEARTBEAT What the ... ? Oh , I need sleep . That 's all . I need sleep , bad . ( YAWNS ) ( LAUGHS ) It 's your Amelia . ( SIGHS ) HEARTBEAT I 've scheduled a medical exam in order for you to undergo a few tests . I can 't think of a thing wrong with me . Do you sleep well ? Yeah . I do have dreams , though . Dark dreams . Maybe we should test some more , to find the cause . No . No more testing . I 'm sure they 're caused by the work I 'm doing . KNOCKING Hi . That was quite a trial . Mind telling me what that was about ? I apologise for any discomfort . It was to see if you 're healthy before I sign everything over . It 's worth it . On paper , you 'll become me and I 'm tired of being sick . If you don 't mind , I 'm gonna go home and get some sleep . But you are home . How 's that ? I took the liberty of having your things brought here . Your room is next to the lab . OK . Do me a favour - no more surprises . I 've had as many as I can take . Sorry . I become over-zealous when I 'm excited . It 's a trait that my wife found unbearable . Your wife ? You said you have no family . I haven 't . She left ... what seems like two lifetimes ago . - Do you keep in touch ? - She died . We have more important things to talk about . Good night , Edward . Good night . Duncan ... What do you know about Everett Longstreet ? Other than he 's one of the most brilliant men of modern history , not much . I 'm talking personally . I can only tell you what I hear . I hear he 's very reclusive . He 's on the Board , but stays away . I wouldn 't speculate on his character . Why ? I 'll explain . Eventually ... Maybe . Is he why you 're packing up your equipment ? Let 's just say I 'm moving to a new location . - Where ? - I can 't say . At least give me an address , so I can report you when I find out how much of this is university property . You 're an old fart . Here , pull my finger . ( LAUGHS ) I 'm gonna miss you , Duncan . Don 't sicken me . I had a spicy lunch and I 'd like it to stay where it is . Edward ... Take care , OK ? Please . Travis Mitchell Serial killer , killed by police during an attempted murder . Clinical sociopath . Images seem to be embedded in my memory . Subject 's thoughts are vivid and seem persistent , perhaps permanent . MOUSE SQUEAKING HEARTBEAT ( LAUGHS ) ELECTRICAL HUMMING I saw it all - the maze , the food , everything ! Not only see it , I could feel it . I could feel his fear , frustration , his determination to find food once I ... once he smelled it . You 've got to get better cheese . Ow ! Fuck . What did I do ? You 've been working very long hours . Perhaps you should rest . I still have some work to do . Maybe I 'll just take a nap . Edward . Excellent work . I 'm proud of you . Thank you . Pleasant dreams . BEEPING AND CRACKLING HEARTBEAT Argh ! Argh ! Everett ? FOOTSTEPS Don 't walk away . I ... I wasn 't . Why can 't we talk ? Who are you ? We spoke of having children . When was that supposed to happen ? You don 't have time for a child . You don 't have time for me . What do you mean ? Of course , I understand that your work is important . That is all you ever talk about . You 're obsessed with this one thing ! I love you , Everett , but you give me no choice . Everett ? You 're going to do it . You 're not gonna stop me . I wish I had never met you . Do you hear what I say ? I hate you ! Wait . No , wait , please ! I have to talk to you ! What 's happening to me ? Am I losing my mind ? Edward . TAPPING There 's celebrating to be done . The paperwork 's done . You 're the sole beneficiary of the Longstreet estate . - Did you hear me ? - What ? Edward , you 're rich . You can pursue your work . Don 't be an asshole . Enjoy it . It 's not that . I don 't know where the work ends ... and I begin . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Hi . Hi . Oh , excuse me . Britt Clark , Everett Longstreet . What a pleasure to meet such a beautiful woman . Thank you . This is ... some place you got here . It 's , uh ... eclectic . So , Britt , uh ... What are you doing here ? I 'm uncomfortable discussing this . Is there another place to talk ? There must be other rooms here . Yeah . I 'm gonna work in my room . Oh , yes , of course . It 's a pleasure to meet you . What do you think of my new surroundings ? It 's big , old , musty . All we need is Igor . I thought we broke up . - You 're here for ... - I needed a lobotomy . No , I was worried about you . What 's really going on here ? I have the chance to go after my dreams , with all the funding I need . It 'll make life so much easier , and I want to find a place for you in it , and for me in yours . Well , that last line was pretty cheesy . I really want things to work out , so I 'll accept it . - I 'm not happy without you . - That 's cheesy , too . OK , I accept your apology . What time is it ? Well , let 's see . The big hand is on six , the little 's on eight . Ha , ha . ( MOANS ) TAPPING Finally - immortality . MOANING I can feel her . Amelia . You were onto something with your work on transference of thought . From what I see , the smoke stimulates production of neural transmitters , then vaporises them . Inhaled , it binds with post-synaptic neurons , transferring memory - collective thought . So much for theory . How do you bring it to life ? Well , what I 'm attempting to do is analyse their chemical structure , code them , input them into the computer . If it works , we 'll be able to store , transfer and filter my memory , thoughts ... even my soul . I placed my bet well with you . If it works . Let 's find out . BEEPING ( GROWLS ) BEEPING I need new hardware . Alright . Let 's give it a shot . Everett ! Why ? What 's happening ? Argh ! EDWARD 'S VOICE : What 's wrong with me ? I must be ... I must be getting sick . ( WHISPERS ) No . This can 't be happening . Longstreet , what have you done to me ? Edward , thanks for the new lease on life . You took my body and erased everything ! How did you do it without me knowing ? My chest . Can 't breathe . LABOURED BREATHING Oh ! Amelia . She was his wife . " 91 1 , emergency operator . " Yes , I ... need some help . I ... think I 'm having a heart attack . " Sir , what 's your address ? " Yes , I 'm at ... 6 ... Ackerman ... Lane . It 's the ... Longstreet residence . " Sir , what 's your name ? " Edward ... " Stay on the line . An ambulance is on its way . " " Sir ? " " Sir , are you there ? " I found a buyer for three pieces , and another guy loves the one with the corset . You OK ? Oh ... Sort of . Yeah . Look ... Britt ... Am I really just wasting my time here ? Oh , no , no . You 're not wasting your time , not in the real sense of the word . You know when two people just don 't ... - I don 't wanna ... - Any time now . I like you . I 'm flattered . I just think of you as a friend . Ah ! No . - Not the F word . - The F word ? Friend . Just don 't say it . OK . I 'm gonna take one last stab at this . Why do you want to be with a guy who has no money , no prospects , nothing but a head full of idealistic crap , who you know will screw up your life ? I know . I know . I 'm crazy . I know . How cosy . Speak of the devil . Edward ? Get the fuck out of here . Take it easy . I said get the fuck out of here ! Are you OK ? What 's wrong with you ? I ... I don 't know . I didn 't mean to hit him . I don 't know why I did that . I misjudged you . I didn 't think you had the balls . There 's your decision . That 's what you want ? SIREN Hello ! Anybody here ? Paramedics . This could be our eighth DOA this week . That would top the all-time record . This could be our shot at immortality . Leon ! I got the coronary in here . Is it the record ? He doesn 't look chipper . Bad news - there 's a pulse . Alright , let 's prepare him for transport . He looks bad . I 'll never eat beef jerky again . Will he make it to General ? - Bet he won 't get to Fifth and Flower . - Main and Ninth . You 're on . I overreacted . I didn 't mean to hit him . It 's not me . You scared me . Come on . I wanna show you something . Come on . - On the roof ? - Mm-hm . I wanna give you something . Come on . This is your gift . Where ? You 're standing on it . You bought me a roof ? No . I bought you the whole building . OK , let me get this straight . First , you 're so broke , you can 't finish your work , then you move into an old , crazy guy 's house , and now you can afford to buy this ? Longstreet left me his estate . He died ? This morning . He had a heart attack . He left me everything . You don 't seem affected . He was old . It was his time . - Now , it 's my time . - Why you ? He had his reasons . Only he knew . I have my reasons . I don 't know what 's with you , but the new you sucks ! TYRES SQUEALING BRAKES SCREECHING Hey ! What are you doing ? Nobody got hit . Oof ! Argh ! SIREN Something went wrong in the transfer . This isn 't me and this isn 't Edward . Hey , excuse me ! What ? - Got some spare change ? - No , I don 't . I think I hear some change jingling . Help me out . Anything at all . Leave me alone . I don 't have any . I heard change ! Won 't you help me out ? - You want some change ? - I don 't want money . Here 's your fucking change ! HEARTBEAT EVERETT 'S VOICE : Oh , my God . What 's happening ? I 'm losing my ... mind ! PANTING ( MUMBLES ) I know it ... sounds crazy ... My body ... being taken over by ... Everett Longstreet . These guys get crazier all the time . ( WHISPERS ) Help me . Time 's running out . Longstreet ... wants me dead . Help , please . Honey ... I 'm gonna get you all the help you need . Damn , right before my break . We have a little problem . Move him to J ward . He had a heart attack symptons , but we found it was induced by an overdose of potassium chloride . Seems mentally unstable and needs 24-hour observation . " Who are you ? " ECHOING : " No . Wait . Who are you ? " SCREAMING EVERETT 'S VOICE : Someone else 's thoughts have entered my mind . The memories can 't be Edward 's , and they 're not mine . " No . " " No ! " ECHOING : " No ! Stop ! " " Who are you ? " " Don 't hurt me , please . " EVERETT 'S VOICE : The hate . The rage . The pain . I 'm losing myself ... to the need to kill . POLICE RADIO : Code 6 , 1 05 North Avenue . Come on , Let 's check it out . HEARTBEAT - Are you Brittany Clark ? - Uh , yeah . Do you know an Edward Adams ? Yeah . He 's a friend . Do you know his whereabouts ? I haven 't seen him since yesterday . Is he OK ? He 's wanted for questioning . If he contacts you , could you give us a call at this number , please ? Sure . HEARTBEAT I don 't know . ( SIGHS ) This is crazy . Where is he ? I called everywhere , Jerry . I have no idea where he is . God , I 'm so tired . Yeah . I know . If you hear from him , call me right away , OK ? I know . OK , bye . Edward ! BRAKES SCREECHING Come on . Come on ! Where the hell are you ? I used so much potassium chloride , your heart should have exploded immediately ! Entered the subject 's memory . Lived his killings . Felt the life slip away , the hate , anger . ( MUMBLES ) Memory proteins from the subject to myself . Can 't control the dark images ? Shit ! He 's put this madness inside of me . He 's alive . He has a history of mental instability . It 's been very hard on the family . He 's in here . I thought you 'd come . Are you enjoying the twisted mind of Travis Mitchell ? Why ? Why would you pollute your memory with someone so - It was an early experiment . I tapped into his mind without realising that it would embed his memory into mine . Now , your memory . Permanently . Why did you do this to me ? I wanted life . I wanted more life . I 'd do anything for it . Potassium chloride is a crude way of trying to induce an artificial heart attack . You should have tried Tramiacin 1 5 . It leaves fewer traces . Edward , any advancement , like true life extension , will be taken over and perverted by the wealthy and powerful . It 's the history of science . The one thing I can thank you for teaching me is that it 's not important how long you live , but how well you live . Both of us have lived our lives , wasted our lives , chasing eternity and failing to live , to enjoy the thing that we covet so much . Sounds like the point of view of a man lying in bed dying , doesn 't it ? Not my point of view . I didn 't expect to hear it from a mind like yours . Edward , I need you to reprocess me , and filter Travis Mitchell out of my soul . Something about the chemical make-up of the diseased mind makes it want to eat away at the healthy part of the mind . It will eat away at you , till you don 't exist . Why should I help you ? Because I have Britt , and if you don 't , I will kill her . You know how well I can kill . Besides , Edward , you don 't have much time to live . Don 't make that true for her , too . I 've reconnected the flow sensor . What 's the flow cycle ? What 's going on , here ? Remember , I said I was trying to digitise my memory and store it in a computer ? Shut up ! What 's the flow cycle ? 6.4 per single wavelength cycle . But you 're Longstreet . Edward told me that . Shut up ! I 'll kill you both now ! Oh , God . - What 's next ? - Set it at maximum , wide open . It 's done . - Will it work ? - I don 't know . You 're pushing beyond the limits of my ability . Make it happen , or I 'll blow your brains out ! I 've been watching you , so don 't try anything . What 's your code ? Oh ... In case you think about stopping this ... Edward ! You can stop the system . Pull the fuse , then look under the glass table . There 's an envelope . It 's your Amelia . ECHOING : " Don 't hurt me , please . " " Who are you ? " " Who are you ! " " No ! " " Don 't ! " " Please ! " Britt , in the event of some gross miscalculation on my part , I 've stored my digitised memory on this disk . ECHOING : " I was worried about you . " " I 'm not happy without you . " " I want things to work out between us . " " I want things to work out between us . " Oh , Edward ! ( PANTING ) Yeah , it 's me . Prove it . Your father left when you were 1 1 . Your mother 's an alcoholic . What about my brother ? You know , I don 't think I 'll ever be the same . What do you mean ? Because I know ... the horror that Longstreet felt . The desperation ... of growing old ... losing hope . It was the desperation of staying alive . I love you .

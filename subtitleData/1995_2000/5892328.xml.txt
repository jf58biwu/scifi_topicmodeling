 WYATT : Guys , I know this looks weird but I got ot make sure this envelope arrives in one piece . You got to be kidding . Nobody stresses this much over a college application . Hey ! My entire future is going ot be in the hands of the US postal service . I 'm entitled to little stress . Brace yourselves . This one 's going to be a Lulu . WYATT : So far so good . Now for the flame test . Not even signed . WYATT : And finally , the Chett test . Maybe I should wait till the postman comes by . Will you just mail the stupid thing ? Geez , you believe this guy ? We 've been seniors ten minutes and already he 's worried about college . Who isn 't ? I 've got applications out to eight schools . Seniors are supposed to skip school go to parties , abuse freshmen not worry about the future . In a way , he 's right . We should have sent off our applications when we were juniors . I didn 't want to look too eager . So why did you write " You may have already won " on the front of your totally indestructible envelope ? How are they going to open it when it gets there ? Oh , man ! Oh , man ! Indestructible envelopes ? They didn 't mention that on college day ? - We had a college day ? - Months ago . Didn 't you hear about it from your guidance counselor ? I have a guidance counselor ? Gary , have you even thought about college ? Sure , but I figured all I had to do was graduate . They automatically bumped me up when I left Junior High . - Aren 't you the least bit worried ? - What for ? College is a whole year away . Nobody else around here is worried about it . Are they ? Ty , you made any decisions about college yet ? You bet . Radcliffe . Math and chemistry , double major . Since when are you interested in math and chemistry ? GARY : " Playpen 's Girls of the Ivy League ? " Hmm . Math major . Chemistry major . Sarah Lawrence , women 's studies . DeVry technical institute ... if they 'll have me . I 'm thinking Evergreen . I 'm going to Texas Tech . A little place called Drew . Florida State ... Okay , everybody else is going to college . So what ? Doesn 't mean I 'm going to be left behind . I 'll just make my work in the real world . You 'll be in school learning about the things I 'll be out there doing . You don 't have to go to college if you don 't want to . I don 't need to . There are plenty of opportunities for a guy like me . My future 's going to turn out fine . This is big business , not a parlor game . A corporate takeover 's supposed to be bloody and if we have to wipe out a small mining town to do it . Well then , so be it . At least , that 's what I think he said . - Kind of hard to hear through the stall . - [ man sighing ] - Altoid ? - Uh-uh . [ toilet flushing ] Who am I kidding ? You got to help me get into college . WYATT : You 're making the right choice applying to Paxton . It 's a smaller school but rated one of the best in the country . The Donnelly men have gone there for six generations . I am telling you it 's an undiscovered gem . I just want to go where you 're going . Cool . Thanks , man . I 'm not going to cry . No , I am not going to cry . I didn 't know you were programmed to do domestic work . - How about whipping me up a sandwich ? - Watch it . I 'm fully capable of whipping you into a sandwich . - I 'm making this for Gary . - Why don 't you just zap up a cup ? - He hates instant . - You really think that lollapa-loser is going to cram four years of college prep into ten days ? Not without a heaping helping of your hoodoo . Wyatt and I are to support Gary , not help him cheat . He 's got to get in on his own merit . Personally , I think he 's up to it . - He 's not as dumb as you think . - You wrote down the wrong race . Uh-huh . I 'm 1 / 16 sioux indian . My great-great grandfather fought with General Custer . That doesn 't make you Native American . He switched sides when he saw how the battle was going . - How is it coming along ? - Ask slinging bull . All I know is unless Wallace has nude photos of the Dean he 'd better get down on his knobby knees and beg sexy Hexie for a wish . Oh , man , I cannot take another practice test . - I give up . - You can 't . You can 't . Your SAT score is the first place they look on your application . Let 's , uh , let 's just try some analogies again , okay ? Oh , God . Okay ... " Black is to white as dog is to ... ? " - " D. " - No , no . " D " the correct answer is " A " - - a cat . - Huh ? - The opposite of black is white . - So the opposite of dog is cat . - But a dog and a cat are the same- - - Four paws , furry , house pet . - Cat ! - Cat ! Cat ! - Let 's just move on , okay ? Let 's ... uh ... Let 's try some geometry . Oh , God . You want me to give you Gary Wallace a college recommendation ? Just a little one ? [ snorts ] [ laughing ] [ laughing ] [ school bell ringing ] [ laughing ] [ laughing ] [ laughing ] [ woman groaning ] [ laughing ] [ laughing ] Gary Wallace . [ laughing ] [ bell rings ] [ laughing ] Mr. Wallace ... about that recommendation you asked me to ... - Glad you got your jollies off . - Precisely , lad . My jollies haven 't gotten off like that in 40-odd years . That 's worth something . It is ? You 'll have your recommendation in the morning . I trust that someday , somewhere you 'll give some unsuspecting Dean as hearty a guffaw as you 've given me . What do we have here ? I have to write an essay on why I want to go to college only I can 't get past the first line . " College is neat . " I see better writing when I 'm melting urinal cakes . Ignore him , Gary . You got it in you . Deep down inside is the soul of an artist just waiting to get out . Hold on a second . Why wait ? Gary , meet your Poet Within . Your inner soul . Can you write an essay on why I want to go ot college ? Wow ! He 's is a poet . You can tell from the ' tube . " College is neato . " Man , my inner soul blows chunks . [ bell rings ] [ bell rings ] Whoo ! Whoo ! Hey .. ! I can 't mail this . This isn 't enough to get me in . - I just know it . - What are you talking about ? You 've improved your SAT scores . You got a recommendation . - Even your grades are going up . - There 's a lot of good stuff here . It all screams " poor to avenge . " I need your help , Lis . - What kind of help ? - Well , if I were to letter in a sport it would really help me stand out from the crowd . They 'd want me for sure . You could make that happen . No . We said no cheating . Yeah , you 've done everything up to now on your own . Why would you ruin it with magic ? Just a little push over the top is all I 'm asking . I 've never done anything that ever mattered in my whole life . Oh , come on . You 've accomplished stuff before . - Like what ? - Well , what about the time you ... ? - Uh ... - There was that thing he did ... - Uh-huh . - Once . - Uh ... - Uh ... Okay , it 's a magical cap . Just buckle the chin strap and go . Man , everyone 's going to laugh at me . Couldn 't you just give me , like a magical jock strap or something ? You really want that stuff south of the border ? I 'll stick with the cap . - Are you sure this 'll get him into college ? - Worked for Forrest Gump . Uh-uh . Hey . - Hey , you can use this lane if you want to . - Thanks . My name 's Buford . People call me " Bubba . " My name 's Gary Wallace . People call me " Gary Wallace . " Hey , look . Scampi 's here . Shrimp Scampi ? Runners , take your marks . You know , there 's all kinds of Shrimp . Shrimp salad ... shrimp coctail ... Hmm . That 's about it . Set ... Who in the hell is that ? Gary Wallace ... just a local idiot . [ laughing ] Hey , you sure are fast . I think you set a record . - Really ? You think so ? - Oh , I know so . Name 's Harold Byer . I recruit for the Princeton University Athletic Department . - Cool ! Gary , Gary Wallace . - I 've never seen anybody run like you . And that hat- - you don 't even care about the wind resistance . By the way , I admire the cheeky nod to hermes the mythological messenger god . - Shows you 're a thinking 's athlete . - Uh ... yeah , read my mind . You better get ready . With talent like you got colleges are going to be busting down your door . - All right . - Walk with me . ANNOUNCER : So Wallace once again stomps the competition . As expected , Bob , there 's isn 't a single record he hasn 't obliterated in the past two days . But what really makes him stand out is that incongruous hat . He 's got style , Bob . He 's the Dennis Rodman of track and field . The question on everyone 's mind is- - which lucky university is going to snag this young superstar ? [ rapid knocking ] GARY : Help ! Let me in ! Wyatt ! - Let me in ! Let me in ! - Come to Princeton ! We got a great deal for you at SMU bet back , you jackals ! - [ crowd shouting ] - Boston Univ ... Why not just tell them you 're going to Paxton and get it done with , huh ? You , uh ... you are still going to Paxton ... remember , huh ? You and me together . - Yeah , I remember , but I ... - You 're going to Princeton . I knew it . A little school like Paxton can 't compete with the bells and whistles of the Ivy League . - I wouldn 't jump to conclusions . - Yeah , I 'm not going to Princeton . - Good . - Who needs Princeton ? If I win my next big race I 'll be the new celebrity spokeman for Astro Wave sneakers . Skip college altogether and turn pro . I thought you wanted to go to college accomplish something . What 's all this about turning pro ? The only reason people go to college is so they can snag a good job and earn some money , right ? I 'm just skipping to the good past . Professional track athletes don 't make money . They work part time at home depot and they live with their parents . - Not if they got what I got . - Blind arrogance ? - Endorsements . - Gary ... Gary , this is a really bad plan . You 're basing your professional career on Lisa 's magic . - Do you see the danger ? - I know I do . It was hard enough for me just trying to get into college . What do you think is going to happen when I actually go ? So , you 're taking the easy way out . Of course , I am . It 's easier . ANNCOUNER : Once again , Bob , all eyes are on Gary Wallace . BOB : Marv , the folks at Astro Wave sneakers have the media out in force . - Wallace has to win this race ... - And test negative for drugs . ... and he 's a lock to be Astro Wave 's new celebrity spokesman . WOMAN : Gary , over here . It 's for TV . TV , of course . MAN : Take your mark ... Should have taken my chance with the magic jock . Great . Katie got accepted to college . Now I have two reasons to be jealous of her . My dorm room 's on the fifth floor . Right across from her . Hey , Wy , congrats on getting accepted to Paxton . Thanks . You heard anything yet ? Yeah . I got accepted to Stanford and Berkeley . - Great . - I can 't go to both though . - Can I have one ? - [ laughing ] Oh , Gary ... I really screwed up this time . I know I missed the deadline for the fall semester but do you think I might get in this spring ? Anything possible . What 's this ? " Dear Mr. Wallace : this is to inform you ... " I don 't believe this . It 's from Paxton University . I 've been accepted for the fall semester . How did this happen ? You remember that perfectly good application you worked so hard at ? The one that got ignored in the wake of your ego-feeding media frenzy ? I kind of sent it out . I meant how did you get it in my locker ? You 're welcome . You really came through for me , Wy . I want you to know I 'm a changed man . No more being a slacker . I 've learned my lesson . What do you say we skip class and go celebrate ? SCAMPI : Attention , students the Social Committee is sponsoring a party this Friday honoring Farber 's college-bound seniors . I expect to see all of you there . Except , of course ...

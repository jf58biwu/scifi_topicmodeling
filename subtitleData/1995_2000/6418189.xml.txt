 RIPLEY : My mommy always said there were no monsters . No real ones . But there are . GEDIMAN : She 's perfect . WREN : Mm-hmm . Careful . Two centimeters . OK . OK . Yeah . Ready with that amnio . Ohh . And ... there it is . Be careful . [ Screeches ] Jesus . Clamp it . GEDIMAN : What about her ? Can we keep her alive ? WREN : How is the host ? Doing well . Sew her back up . Excellent work , everybody . WREN : How is our Number Eight today ? GEDIMAN : Appears to be in good health . WREN : Hmm ? How good ? GEDIMAN : Excellent ... as in completely off our projected charts . Look at the scar tissue . See the recession ? WREN : This is from three days ago ? GEDIMAN : Exactly . WREN : Oh , this is good . This is very good . You 're gonna make us all very proud . [ Choking ] WREN : Don 't ! I 'm all right ! Now try this . Hand . Close . Glove . scientist : Number Eight ? Fruit . scientist : Good . Cherries . WREN : It 's unprecedented . GEDIMAN : Totally . She 's operating at a completely adult capacity . What about her memories ? WREN : There are gaps ... and some degree of synaptic dissonance . She 's freaked . It has connective difficulties ... caused by a biochemical imbalance ... causing emotional autism . Certain reactions- - Wait a second ! " lt " has memories ! Why does " it " have memories ? Well , I 'm guessing , but ... inherited memories passed down generationally ... at a genetic level by the aliens , like its strength . Plus a highly evolved form of instinct . GEDIMAN : An unexpected benefit from the genetic crossing . Oh , ho ho ho ! I see . Stupid me . Of course ! An unexpected benefit of the genetic process . And I didn 't even think of that . GEDIMAN : You 're not thinking termination ? PEREZ : Oh , boy , am I thinking termination . WREN : General , we do not perceive this to be a problem . PEREZ : Ellen Ripley died trying to wipe this species out . For all intents and purposes , she succeeded . I don 't want her taking up her old hobbies . - That won 't happen . - We won 't tell her . PEREZ : Oh , I see . And that 's supposed to comfort me . COMPUTER : ldentification , please . [ Exhales ] [ Beeping ] COMPUTER : Please try again . [ Exhales ] COMPUTER : Thank you , General Perez . PEREZ : The bottom line is ... she looks at me funny one time , I 'm putting her down . OK , as far as I 'm concerned ... Number Eight is a meat by-product . Her Majesty here is the real payoff . When does she start producing ? Days . Less , maybe . We need the cargo . PEREZ : I told you , it 's on its way . [ Roars ] [ Growls ] Fork . Fuck . It 's--it 's a fork . How did you ... GEDIMAN : How did we get you ? Yes . GEDIMAN : Hard work . We used blood samples from Fiori 16 , on ice ... where you died . We 've remade you . We cloned you . Does it grow ? Yeah . Very rapidly . It 's a queen . How did you know that ? She 'll breed . You 'll die . Everyone in the Company will die . GEDIMAN : In the Company ? WREN : Weyland Yutani ... Ripley Eight 's former employers . Terran growth conglomerate . They had defense contracts under the military . I think you will find that , uh ... things have changed a great deal since your time . I doubt that . WREN : We 're not flying blind here , you know . It 's United Systems Military , not some greedy corporation . Oh . It won 't make any difference . You 're still gonna die . WREN : How do you feel about that ? I wish you could understand what we 're trying to do here . The potential for this species ... goes way beyond urban pacification . New alloys , new vaccines . Nothing like this we 've ever seen ... on any world before . You should be very proud . Oh ... I am . And the animal itself--wondrous . The potential ? Unbelievable , once we 've tamed them . Roll over , play dead , heel ? Mm-hmm . You can 't teach it tricks . Why not ? We 're teaching you . ELGYN : Time to enjoy ... some of the General 's hospitality , Christie . CHRISTlE : Great . Army food . Yeah . It 'll do till we get the family wagon up to spec . Yeah . That is , if the natives are friendly . How 's that ? Good . We expecting any trouble ?

Yourself , for example . Drink , Elgyn ? Constantly . ELGYN : Now , I 'm gonna take a wild guess here , General ... but I 'm thinking whatever you got going on here ... it ain 't exactly approved by Congress . Who 's the new filly you got on board , Elgyn ? Call ? Little girl playing pirates . She makes an impression . She is severely fuckable , ain 't she ? Ha ha ha ! Mind you ... I think she 's just a tad curious ... about this little transaction of ours . I mean , I can 't say as I blame her . It 's awfully cloak-and-dagger stuff . It 's a military operation . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . ELGYN : Correct me if I 'm wrong , but , uh ... I was under the impression that most army medical labs ... don 't have to operate outside of regulated space . What do you want , Elgyn ? - Me ? - Yeah . Two days bed and board .

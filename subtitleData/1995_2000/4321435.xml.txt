 Anything ? Not really . The polyferranide deposits are contaminated with astiline . Commander , there 's something over here I think you should see . Pack it up . We 'll find better quality somewhere down the line . That line is going to be cut short when our nacelles burn themselves up if we don 't find it soon . What have you got , Lieutenant ? There have been other visitors to this moon recently . What do you think this is ? Some kind of message ? I don 't want you to go wandering off . I 'm not . I 'm just looking at something . Antonio . Vay-chit no-op-puse-nee . Chakotay , kay-nee-post . Pon-ah-chee nun-pah-hee-no . Kay-nee-post itchee-oh . Kep-pon-nee ! He says you 're quite a scout . A kep-pon-nee . I was just looking at a lizard when I saw it . Well , it was your eyes that saw it . No one else 's did . That 's the important thing . Come . I want you to understand this . It 's a blessing to the land . An ancient healing symbol . A CHAH-mooz-ee . They probably cut this down for firewood . The Rubber Tree people ? Well , the closest thing to the Ancient Rubber Tree people that we 'll ever see . The people in this tribe are their descendants . Just like we are . But they never left this jungle . And they rarely intermarry with other tribes . And they still use firewood instead of magnesite fuel like everyone else . Chakotay , they 've chosen to live like this for centuries . That 's why we are traveling on foot and not using a transporter . We honor the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land . Sacred land ? Yes . Huh . The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere . Maybe it 's a blessing to the land . For damaging it with the campfire . What is your basis for that conclusion , Commander ? Oh , just ... something somebody told me once . Describe the nature of your pain . In the lower back . It 's tight . Choose the word that would best describe your pain . Burning , throbbing , piercing , pinching , biting , stinging , shooting ... Shooting . It even goes down my legs . Hmm . is the baby all right ? Hmm ? Oh , certainly . Fine , nothing to worry about . Well , that makes me feel better . The position of the baby is simply putting pressure on your sciatic nerve . You may return to your post . The pain makes it difficult to sit for any period of time . It 's really quite uncomfortable . Elevating your legs when you sit should provide all the relief you need . Perhaps a day of rest , off-duty . Mm-mm . Ensign Wildman , according to your medical history , this is your first pregnancy , correct ? Yes . Well , Ensign , unfortunately , pregnancy causes its fair share of discomforts and you 'll have to learn to live with them . That 's just the way it is . We 'll schedule her for follow-up in two days . If the pain has not subsided on its own by then , we 'll attempt to decrease the sensitivity of the nerve in that region . Thank you , Doctor . Call me day or night if this gets any worse . Don 't you have any compassion for the way she feels ? Every member of this crew is an adult . I will not coddle them . Compassion can be your department . Fortunately , you have enough for both of us . You 've never been sick or in pain . I just wish , once in your life , you could know what it 's like , how it makes you feel vulnerable and a little afraid . Then you 'd understand . I don 't have a life . I have a program . I hated every minute of it . My father had dragged me all the way from our colony near the Cardassian border on this quest of his . Away from my friends , my home , and here we were , in the middle of a brutal Central American jungle looking for the descendants of the Ancient Rubber people . It must have been very important to him . Believe me , it was . And he was very disappointed that I didn 't share his enthusiasm . He 'd been tracking down the origins of our tribe for years . The one on the right is the one I found today . And now , something you saw on that trip years ago , shows up again on a moon surface almost 70,000 light-years away . I don 't suppose you have any theories that might explain this . I can give you an official Rubber Tree people theory if you like . - Sky Spirits . - Sky Spirits ? It 's an ancient myth . Sky Spirits from above created the first Rubber people in their own image , and led the way to a sacred land where the Rubber people would live for eternity . You obviously don 't put a great deal of faith in this explanation . How much faith do you put in Adam and Eve ? Hasn 't science proved that all humans developed from a single evolutionary process ? That 's what I was always taught . On the other hand , none of my teachers ever spent much time in the Delta Quadrant . B 'Elanna tells me we picked up a warp signature heading away from the moon . Think we should follow it ? I don 't know that it 's fair for me to put my own personal curiosity ahead of the ship 's priorities . We still haven 't found the polyferranide we need to seal the warp coils . If these people have warp technology , they might be able to help us . Besides ... we are in the business of exploring , aren 't we ? My father would put on his expedition hat and shout , " Let 's go ! " I guess that 's good enough for me . Showing no life signs . Mr. Paris , are you certain the warp signature ended here ? Positive , Captain . Harry , check your sensors . That look like some kind of power source to you ? That is an unusually high EM reading for a natural occurrence . Could be some kind of cloaking technology . Mr. Kim , transmit a continuous message on all frequencies identifying who we are , where we 're from and make it clear our intentions are peaceful . Torres to Bridge . Go ahead . We 're in luck , Captain . My readings are showing high concentrations of polyferranide about ten kilometers below the surface . Acknowledged . We 'll send out an away team to continue the survey . Report to Transporter Room 3 . On my way . Commander , if we meet any resistance abort the mission . I have no intention of disturbing an alien race that would rather be left alone . Understood . On the other hand , if we can make contact , our goal is to get permission to begin excavation as soon as possible . Tuvok , you 're with me . Mr. Neelix , please report to Transporter Room 3 for an away mission . I 'll meet you there , Commander . We may be out of luck . Problem ? I 'm not sure we can transport down . Every time we try to lock on to a transport sight , a storm begins . Storm ? We 've tried seven different sites and as soon as we lock on , an electrical storm forms right above the location . When we change sites , a new storm forms and the old one dissipates . Might the transporter beam itself be causing an electrostatic charge in the atmosphere ? That 's as good a guess as any . I can 't explain it . We just can 't transport . Fine , we 'll take a shuttle . Once again , the storm seems to have formed as a direct result of our interaction with the atmosphere . The meteorological conditions changed radically when we began our entry sequence . Shields are holding . It takes more than a little thunderstorm to bother one of your mighty Starfleet ships , huh ? Nothing we can 't handle . Relax , Neelix . That 's why they call it a rain forest . Why do your Sky Spirits choose a place where it rains all the time ? And it 's hot ... and there are so many bugs ? It 's said the Sky Spirits honored the land above all else . Maybe it 's because this land yields so many different kinds of life . Maybe they wanted us to become friends with everything in nature . including the bugs . Sorry , Sky Spirits . I will never make friends with bugs . Maybe that 's why they keep biting you . You 're miserable . It was a mistake to bring you . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I can 't be what you want me to be . From the day you came out of your mother ... upside down ... I knew the spirits had chosen you to be a contrary . No one chooses for me . I choose my own way . And if that makes me a contrary , I 'll have to live with it . If you have no spirits to guide you , I fear you will lose your way . Altitude : 5,000 meters . Decreasing speed to 720 kph . Entering terminal approach phase . Visibility still zero . Switching to enhanced terrain scanning . Touchdown sight scanned . Continuing descent . Computer , activate the emergency medical holographic program . Please state the nature of the medical emergency . I thought we changed your program so you wouldn 't have to say that anymore . We did . But I became so uncomfortable trying to find new ways to " break the ice , " as it were , that I restored it . Let 's just say it works for me . Doctor ? Ah , you noticed . Are holograms supposed to ... sneeze ? Generally , no . But I have accepted your challenge . I programmed myself with the symptoms of the 29-hour Levodian flu . Thus I will gain the experience that you suggest would be beneficial to the performance of my duties . Holographic tissue paper for the holographic runny nose . Don 't offer them to patients . Mmm , interesting sensation , blowing one 's nose . It 's my first time . I think this is very brave of you . Nothing of the sort . I intend it to be an educational experience . I 'm sure you 'll learn a lot . I meant for the crew . I 'm tired of the whiny , cranky attitudes we see around here . I intend to serve as an example of how one 's life and duties do not have to be disrupted by simple illness . Doc ? I don 't feel so good . Neither do I , and you don 't hear me complaining . We are not making any progress locating the source of that unusual power reading , Commander . Then I guess we 'll have to search for these people the old-fashioned way- - with our eyes and ears . is something bothering you , Commander ? No , it just reminds me of another jungle that I visited once . The Central American rain forest on Earth . It 's the only other place in the universe that I 've ever seen this flower . It appears to be a rare variety of Cypriprdium of the Asiatic genus PaphiopediIum . I never knew you had such horticultural expertise , Mr. Vulcan . In fact , I am- - or , more accurately , I was- - a breeder of prize Vulcan orchids . Then we have something in common- - l breed orchids , too ! Don 't they make the most exquisite salad ? A touch of Baldoxic vinegar- - pure heaven . I hereby designate the two of you the team 's botanical surveyors . Collect a sample of that flower . B 'Elanna ? It 's just what we 've been looking for . Almost pure polyferranide . But there 's a problem with crust reactivity . If we can 't solve it before excavation , we might contaminate the entire yield . Have Ensign Kim run an analysis from the ship . We should be able to ... I 'll be damned . What ? It almost looks like a hawk , doesn 't it ? Listen to him , Chakotay . What does he say to you ? He says , " You are home . " Huh ? I 'm leaving the tribe , Father . What ? I got to know a lot of the Starfleet officers patrolling the Cardassian border . I asked Captain Sulu if he would sponsor me at Starfleet Academy . And he would do such a thing without even discussing it with me ? I told him I had your approval . Ah ! I kept him as far away from you as I could . I take it you 've been accepted by the Academy . Well , you 've never fully embraced the traditions of our tribe , I know that . And you 've always been curious about other societies . And that is why I allowed you to read about them . Because I believe that ignorance is our greatest enemy . But to leave the tribe ... Our tribe lives in the past . A past of fantasy and myth . That past is a part of you , no matter how hard you try to reject it . Other tribes have learned to accept the 24th century . Why can 't ours ? It is not the place of a 15-year-old boy to question the choices of his tribe . I know . That 's why I have to leave . You will never belong to that other life . And if you leave , you will never belong to this one . You 'll be caught between worlds . I ask for your blessing , Father . Oon-day . Oon-day , KoIopak . Botanical surveyor number one to Commander Chakotay . Go ahead , Neelix . You won 't believe what I found . I think it 's ... Neelix , what the ... ? The bird , the bird ! My eye ! Away team to Voyager . Go ahead , Commander . Emergency beam-out . Get Neelix to Sick Bay . Acknowledged . Commander . You 're very lucky this bird didn 't snatch your eye right out of the socket . We have no spare Talaxian eyeballs . is something the matter with him ? The Doctor gave himself the Levodian flu to see what it 's like . is he contagious ? It 's a holographic simulation , not an actual virus . There 's no need for concern . You may sit up . Touchy , isn 't he ? He isn 't feeling well . I don 't require any compassion , thank you very much . I have been experiencing these symptoms for nearly 20 hours , and I am in complete command of my faculties . You may both leave now . Mr. Kim believes if we bombard the crust with antithoron radiation , we can decontaminate it before excavation begins . Then all we need to do is locate these people and get their permission . Any progress ? Everything we 've found here suggests the people who live in this village left recently and in a hurry . Do you believe our arrival frightened them ? We can 't discount that . You 'd think with warp technology , they would have encountered other alien life before now . You 'd think with warp technology , they wouldn 't be living like this . Captain , have you had any unusual readings that might explain the images of a strange face I 've been seeing ? Images ? Very odd . Like the flash of a memory . But it 's someone I 've never met . Nothing unusual has shown up on the ship 's sensors . Tuvok hasn 't detected any telepathic activity , either . If you want to call it a day , Commander ... No . I think we 'll press on for a while . If there are any other problems , I 'll let you know . Chakotay out . The dwellings are constructed with an alloy polymer matrix we 've never encountered before , Commander . They 're out there . Our tricorders may not tell us so , but they 're out there . Lay down your weapons . Commander ? Disarm- - l want them to see that we don 't pose any threat to them . May I remind the Commander that Starfleet protocol demands that away teams remain armed and ready to defend themselves until contact is ... I know all about Starfleet protocol , Lieutenant . As we have not yet established the inhabitants ' intentions , it would not be a logical course of action . The logical course isn 't always the right course . Lay down your weapons in plain sight . Those are my orders . Would you at least permit me to advise the Captain to move the ship into a stronger tactical position ? Negative . We 'll show no force of any kind . For the record , I must take exception to these orders . Noted . They have reason to be scared . Who can blame them ? Their history , our history , is filled with conquerors who brought slavery and disease and death . Maybe we should just leave them alone . Oh-chip way-nob-ee teem-mock-uh an-tope-ah-nee . Hi-yeta-koo-nay-pas . Cha-kan-a hi-mee . Cha-kan-a hi-mee . Duh su kan-nuh-da . Binda kana . Binda kana . Father . Kah-yo-tay . Hay-noh . CHAH-mooz-ee . Teem-ma-ka-ha . I have no explanation , Commander ! There is no storm activity indicated . All right , let 's get back to the shuttle . Hey ! Wait ! We will never make it ! Where 's Chakotay ? ! Away team to Voyager . Emergency beam-out . He was right behind us . I don 't understand what could have happened to him . Was he wearing the combadge the last time you saw him ? Just before the storm , he was using it to speak with you , Captain . Mr. Paris , what are the current surface conditions near the shuttle ? Surface conditions are back to normal , Captain . Winds two knots , but ... I can 't find any sign of their shuttle . It 's not where they landed it . And it isn 't airborne ? No , ma 'am . I 'll lead the away team back . Mr. Tuvok , Lieutenant , you 're with me . Mr. Paris , you have ... Captain Janeway , this is the Doctor . Please turn to your emergency medical holographic channel . What is it , Doctor ? Something terrible has happened . My program ... Doctor , I think you 're carrying this experiment of yours a little too far . One hour too far , to be precise . I very specifically programmed a 29-hour Levodian flu . And it has now been 30 hours . Doctor , I 'm sorry , but we have more pressing matters ... You can 't leave me like this . I need help , now ! Get me somebody who can tweak the computer and make me feel better , immediately . Very well . Mr. Kim is on his way . Try to relax , Doctor . I 'll see to that , Captain . I 'm going to need you with me , Kes . Prepare a medkit and bring it with you to Transporter Room 3 . Commander Chakotay is still on the surface and may be injured . Janeway out . Oh , I don 't understand it . I ... I ran a computer diagnostic and it said that my program was fine . Just rest , Doctor . Here 's a cool , holographic towel for your forehead . Oh , thank you . Thank you so much . Please ... don 't go yet . I have to . The Captain ... I feel like I 'm fading , just ... fading away . You don 't know what that means to a hologram . What seems to be the problem ? My simulated virus is leading me to a simulated death . It 's nothing to worry about . I just added a couple of hours to his computer program . He 'll be fine in about 45 minutes . Knowing when it would end didn 't exactly make it a fair test , did it , Doctor ? Oh , she is far more devious than I ever suspected . No shuttle . Well , at least they got out okay . You have nothing to fear from me . Talk to me . Let me see you . Is-to ko-hee-nis . No ! Thank you . You have nothing to fear from me . Talk to me . Let me see you . I don 't understand it . It 's the same thing that happened the first time we tried to go down . A storm develops wherever we try to lock on . Why would we have the ability to beam people up , but not to beam them down ? I believe we have seen enough to discern a pattern , Captain . The logical conclusion is that someone is controlling the elements of nature to ward us off . The transporter anomaly is evidence of this conclusion . We are allowed to leave the planet , but not to approach . If that 's true , I 'd be happy to respect their wishes , but , unfortunately , I have a missing crewman to get back first . Janeway to Paris . Yes , Captain . Mr. Paris , we 're going to land Voyager on the surface . Take us into the atmosphere . Acknowledged . Beginning entry sequence . I 'm reading electrical storms forming all around us . Adjusting flight path . The barometric pressure is continuing to fall . We 're looking at monsoon conditions out there . Mr. Paris , the shuttle crew didn 't report turbulence this severe during their landing . I 'm doing the best I can , Captain . I 'm showing gale force winds out there . It is conceivable that the aliens have been able to intensify their response now that they are familiar with our capabilities . Red Alert ! lnertial dampers are off-line . We seem to be caught in some kind of vortex . I can 't maintain altitude . Captain , it 's a cyclone . Altitude 20,000 meters and falling . I can 't get us out of this thing , Captain . Bridge to Torres . We need more power from the engines . I 've got them running 20 percent over rated maximum , Captain . It 's not enough . Could we go to low warp under these conditions ? The ship might make it without inertial dampers , but we 'd all just be stains on the back wall . I can try to augment the engines with power from the auxiliary fusion reactors , but it 's going to take at least 20 minutes . How much time do we have , Mr. Paris ? Altitude at 18,000 meters and falling . At this rate , we 're looking at about ten minutes . If you can hear me , speak to me . Dosh-du-pah kee-ne ? Swasge-muh kee-say-yo-pah ? Swas-ti-ma-hay . Kee-say-yo-pah . Pah-kee-ne ? Sas-ga no-yo-du no-kay-dah ? I 'm sorry . I don 't know the ancient language of my people . I can 't understand . Po-kud-zee yo-atah . Pon-tez-butz-su . A CHAH-mooz-ee . CHAH-mooz-ee . Swasge-muh kee-say . Yo-pah no-kay-dah ? CHAH-mooz-ee . Altitude 6,000 meters . Warning . Approach vector is too steep . Discontinue landing sequence . Would somebody turn that off , please ? Engineering , report . We need that extra power , B 'Elanna . Ten minutes . I just need ten minutes ! Do you understand my words now ? Yes . Explain the face marking . I wear it to honor my father . He wore it to honor his ancestors . Ancestors ... You are human ? Yes . Are there others on your world with this mark ? Yes . Not many , but some . We were taught all of them had been annihilated . We were taught your world had been ravaged by those with no respect for life or land . There was a time when that was true . But no longer . He claims to be a descendent of the inheritors . Inheritors ? The ones ... our ancestors chose to honor . I 'm surprised you have no memory of the inheritors . One of our gifts was the memory . If you are a descendent , you should remember . I 'm not sure I understand . Perhaps it has been lost over time . 45,000 years ago , on our first visit to your world , we met a small group of nomadic hunters . They had no spoken language , no culture , except the use of fire and stone weapons , but they did have a respect for the land and for other living creatures that impressed us deeply . We decided to give them an inheritance- - a genetic bonding- - so they might thrive and protect your world . On subsequent visits , we found that our genetic gift brought about a spirit of curiosity and adventure . It impelled them to migrate away from the cold climate to a new , unpeopled land . It took them almost a thousand generations to cross your planet . Hundreds of thousands of them flourished in their new land . Their civilization had a profound influence on others of your species . But then new people came with weapons and disease . The Inheritors who survived scattered . Many sought refuge in other societies . 12 generations ago when we returned , we found no sign of their existence . My people called you the Sky Spirits . Why have you been hiding from us since we landed here ? When we heard your message , who you were , observed you probing our land , we believed you were a threat . We thought you would annihilate us as you had the inheritors . Our message was supposed to communicate peaceful intentions . We were taught that is the way human conquerors often introduce themselves . As I said ... we 've tried to change our ways since the last time you stopped by . Altitude : 2,000 meters . Stand by , Bridge . We 're initiating the transfer now . I 'm showing an eight percent boost in the engines . That 's all ? The fusion reactors are nearly drained . Fighting the storm is taking every reserve we have . Altitude : 1,000 meters . lmpact in 20 seconds . B 'Elanna . lmpact in 15 seconds . I 'm sorry , Captain , that 's all we 've got . lmpact in ten seconds . Report . We 're free . Gaining altitude . 2,000 meters . 2,500 . Dampers back on line . The storms have completely dissipated . There 's not a cloud in the sky . Stand down Red Alert . Anybody have an explanation ? It appears the inhabitants of this planet have decided to make contact , Captain . The cloaking device has been turned off , and we are showing an alien population . I have located the shuttle . It may be possible to locate Commander Chakotay without landing . Establish a search pattern , Mr. Paris . Yes , Captain . Begin scanning for human life signs . As soon as you find Chakotay , we 'll send down an away team . My ship will be coming for me soon . I 'm sorry we cannot permit you to extract all the materials you need . You were generous to offer as much as you did . You have a long journey ahead . It took us more than two generations to reach your world . I wish I could see my father 's face right now . Does he still live ? No . He died fighting enemies who would have taken our home colony . Our tribe moved there a few hundred years ago . So he honored the land just as ... his ancestors did . Yes . Yes , he did . We weren 't on very good terms when he died . Once he was gone , I didn 't know how to reconcile our differences , how to heal our old wounds . I returned to my colony , and continued the fight in his name . I took the mark that he wore to honor his ancestors . I spoke to him in my vision quests , but he never answered . Until now . CHAH-mooz-ee . Commander . Put those away . Listen to him , Chakotay . Do you hear what he says to you ? Yes , Father . I hear him . I finally hear him . Four to beam up , Voyager .

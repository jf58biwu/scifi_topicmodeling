 You look like the cat that ate the rat . The hunt is over . Outstanding . - Corner-office time , angel . - Corner office ? - Daddy , I 'm out of here . - You 're leaving the Centre ? We had a deal . I bring backJarod , and I walk out on my own terms . Daddy ? This is just the beginning , angel . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Laughing ] [ Gasping ] It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're awake . It 's over . No , you 're wrong . It 'll never be over . [ Jarod ] You don 't owe me anything , Mrs. Hartunian . - Jarod , please call me Rita . - Rita . Where I come from , people show gratitude . You saved my store from that extortionist who calls himself a landlord . I owe you . Mi casa es su casa . Okay . - Oh , you like lottery ? - I 've never actually played one before . Ah . Here . Take , scratch , enjoy . Thank you . Well , uh , according to the odds , your chances of winning the jackpot ... are one in 13,983,816 . Well , that 's the same odds as getting hit by lightning in a submarine . - Look , you bring me good luck . Maybe I do same for you . - [ Doorbell Jingles ] Okay , I 'll give it a try . [ Laughs ] - Oh , my - - Are you all right ? - I 'm so sorry . - It 's okay . - It 's just - It fell over . - [ Rita ] All over the floor . Hey ! Hey ! Get back here ! Hey ! Hey ! [ Gasps , Grunts ] Are you all right ? Stay right there . It 's my backpack . And Mrs. Hartunian 's cash . - What 's your name ? - None o ' ya . - None o ' ya ? - Yeah . None of your business . You planning on taking a little train ride , None o ' ya ? I don 't have to tell you anything . You 're not a cop . [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] Let me give you some advice , Dylan ... Hale . The next time you want to pickpocket your dad 's wallet ... you might want to make sure there 's some more cash in it . - He looks like an okay guy . - He 's a jerk . Most lawyers are . Clothes . Toothbrush . I would bet my lottery tickets you were running away from home . - Why do you care ? - Because I was never lucky enough to have one . - Well , that makes two of us . - [ Sighs ] Look , if you 're running away from your family , take my advice . Don 't . Whatever the problem is , you can work it out ... together . Look , I 'm goin 'to Atlanta to live with my friends . That 's all the family I need . That little thief . Are you gonna let me go or call the cops ? How about I take you home instead ? [ Jarod ] Wow . - You live on a boat ? - Yeah . My dad moved into the harbor a few weeks ago , after he and my mom split up . - Where is she now ? - London . She 's , uh , setting up house , starting a new job . Look , I 'm telling you . This is a waste of time . My dad 's at the firm . He 's always at the firm . There 's our boat over there . Hmm . Looks like somebody 's home . - I can 't believe it . - Is that your dad ? I can 't believe he 's home . He 's never home . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - [ Siren Wailing ] - Nothing . So , you were saying about the boat ? Before my dad got busy with the new firm ... we were fixin ' up the boat . There was thinners , paints ... - all kinds of stuff that could have blown up on board . - All right . We 're still trying to reach your mom overseas , but until then ... I 'll arrange for Social Services to put you up . Okay ? [ Man Sighs ] - There 's something you 're not telling him . - [ Sighs ] Yeah . We found this tacked up on the bulletin board . It 's Hale 's writing . A suicide note . [ Sighs ] - Do you mind if I tell him ? - All right . Excuse me . Thought we had an agreement , Detective . I am always the first call . - Look , I didn 't realize this guy was from your firm . - What have we got ? The divers are in the water , but with an explosion this size and these currents ... it could take 48 hours before they find Hale 's body . You make it 36 , okay ? - Hale has a son . Where is he ? - Yeah . He was sittin ' right over th - - Find that kid . His father may have said something to him . - [ Sighs ] Oh , no . [ Broots ] And Jarod was long gone , uh , by the time we got to his desert cabin ... but , um , uh , this was in the desk drawer . - Subtext is rather obvious . - Yeah . - Parker 's conclusion ? - Oh , well , uh - Miss Parker was unable to accompany us on the trip . - Unable ? - She 's , uh , sick . I realize that she 's ... cultivated other interests . Far be it for me to pass judgment ... on somebody consumed by their passion . But - [ Sighs ] There are others who won 't be as forgiving as myself ... if she 's unable to focus on her responsibilities . [ Scoffs ] You 're gonna make someone a wonderful wife . You should see me with a vacuum . - [ Laughs ] - Why aren 't you dressed for work ? 'Cause it 's a beautiful day , and I thought we 'd grab some wine and go out to the - Parker , you have to talk to your father . I know . Look , if we 're ever gonna have a future together ... you 're gonna have to be honest with him . It 's the only way you can ever be free . I know . I can 't live without you . I don 't even want to think about it , okay ? [ Woman On P.A. ] All passengers for the Florida Sun ... the train will be departing in five minutes from Track " C. " You have to dial 011 first . - You were calling your mother , weren 't you ? - What do you want from me ? The police found a note . What kind of note ? It was in your father 's handwriting . They don 't think that the explosion on the boat was an accident . I 'm really sorry . Here 's your father 's wallet . - I thought you might like to have it . - Keep it . - So you 're just gonna run ? - Yeah . Back to Atlanta where life made more sense . Your mother is going to be coming for you soon . They said she was away for the weekend . They keep tryin ' to reach her . Look , I can meet her in Atlanta . I can 't go back to the police . They 'll put me in Social Services , or worse , a foster home . Dylan , I - I can 't leave you out here alone . Where else can I go ? [ Rita 's Voice ] He robs me , then begs to stay in my extra room ? I don 't even want to be here . Oh , and so polite . You did say that I brought you good luck , didn 't you ? [ Laughs ] Oh , it would be good to hear footsteps ... on these tired floorboards again . I 'm sorry about your father . Dylan , are you all right ? [ Sighs ] Before I left this morning ... I told my dad that I hated him ... that I wished he would go away forever . We all say things that we don 't mean sometimes . [ Sighs ] That 's the problem . [ Scoffs ] I 'm not sure that I didn 't . [ Sniffles ] My dad ... was having an affair ... with some woman named Ashley . I heard him and my mom fighting about it . He was always sneaking off and - to the pay phone in the marina to call her . [ Sighs ] He didn 't even try to deny it . Then Mom left to set up the house ... and that 's when me and Dad moved to the boat . Dylan , who were the two men on the dock ? They 're from my dad 's law firm . The old guy 's Edgar Hoyt . The other one 's name is Winston . He 's the head of Security . He 's a bad man , Jarod . Why do you say that ? About a month ago , I , uh , heard arguing ... and it was Winston and my dad on the dock . He was threatening him , telling him that he better not cross the firm ... and he had no idea how powerful they were ... and that he should do the right thing to protect his family . Then he slapped my dad in the face and walked away . I wish he 'd never started working at that place . I have to get on the inside . Now what is it a group of tax attorneys would fear the most ? Same thing we all fear . [ Woman 's Voice ] The Internal Revenue Service . We 're all a little surprised by your visit . Well , surprise is what we 're all about . After all , we are the I.R.S. - Very nice building . - We 're very proud of it . Mr. Hoyt 's office . He 's expecting you . Thank you . Mr. Tally . Welcome . Mr. Hoyt . I hope I 'm not here at an inconvenient time . - Well , if I said you were , would you leave ? - No , I guess I wouldn 't . - We 're a very busy firm . - I 'm sorry . I didn 't catch your name . This is Mr. Winston . He 's head of Security . As I told your assistant ... the service has discovered some irregularities in your previous year 's tax files . It 's nothing serious . We 've just changed the limits on some deductible items ... and it 's thrown off your balance sheets . - How long is this gonna take ? - Well , if I don 't find any unforeseen problems ... I should be out of your hair in , oh , 48 hours . They 've set up an office for you down the hall . If there 's anything I can do , you just ask . I 'll do that . Mr. Hoyt . Mr. Winston . [ Typing ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeps ] - [ Jarod ] Was there any word from his mother ? - [ Rita ] No . I thought he 'd wear his finger to a nub dialing it-redialing . Ah , he 's keeping his chin up ... but his eyes can 't cover the pain . [ Sighs ] His father ? I got the number off the pay phone he used to call Ashley . The other woman . [ Jarod ] Now Dylan said he called her on his mother 's birthday . Phone company records show all the calls made from that location on that day . Well , what are we looking for ? The one number that was called a lot on the previous days . That must be Ashley 's phone number . By running the number through a reverse directory ... we can find out exactly who this woman is . - [ Rita ] So , who 's the home-wrecker ? - [ Jarod ] There wasn 't one . Ashley wasn 't a woman . He was an agent with the F.B.I. Hale wasn 't having an affair . Then why 'd my dad let my mom leave ? My guess is that he was trying to protect you . Pushing you and your mother away was the only way he knew how to keep you safe . - Protect us from what ? - Let 's find out . Agent Matthew Ashley , please . Excuse me . When ? No . Uh , thank you anyway . - [ Phone Beeps ] - What 'd they say ? Agent Ashley is dead . He was killed in a traffic accident five days ago . [ Woman 's Voice ] Ashley never said anything about working with the D.O.J. Ashley was investigating a local law firm the D.O.J. Has its eye on . Now , I propose that we marshal our forces . - Senator Meeks 's office is on line two . - Call him back . - He 's very unhappy . - Yeah , that makes two of us . It 's quite a zoo you 're running here . That 's what happens when one of your best people dies unexpectedly . - Is there any word on what caused the accident ? - There was road construction . Ashley lost control . It was a freak thing . A freak thing ? Ashley had an informant inside Hoyt and Associates . This informant was collecting evidence implicating the firm in the death of a key witness ... set to testify against one of their major clients . Does this informant have a name ? He refused to identify himself . - And the evidence ? - Ashley died before he received it . Now , if you 'll excuse me . Great . It 's great . - Well , I hope you found everything in order . - So far so good . Fast and sharp - A lethal combination . Well , a corporation in Delaware kept me on retainer for several years . It was a scary place , but I learned a few things along the way . Oh , one more thing . I ran into a lot of references to work done by a man named Peter Hale . I tried to browse his expense reports , but I was denied access . - Well , certain files are " need to know " only . - Well , I need to know . - I 'll arrange to have those files delivered immediately . - Very good . - If you 'll excuse us . - [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Beeping ] Hmm . Even the boss 's office . [ Beeps ] Why doesn 't that surprise me , Winston ? He 's an I.R.S. Grunt . What 's to like ? - I don 't know . I have a bad feeling about him . - Craig , you 're paranoid . You pay me to be paranoid . The last thing we need ... is somebody asking questions about Peter Hale . Hale is dead . Besides , it wasn 't me that got us into this mess . - It was you . - Hey , I did what had to be done . I never suggested murder . If I hadn 't shut those people up , De Paz would still be sitting in jail . - How do you think the rest of the clients would react - - De Paz . To the fact that Hoytand Associates couldn 't handle a case like De Paz . - Getting him out was crucial to the firm 's survival . - Gotcha . You know that . You also know that a trial could have ruined us . Now look , I may have innocent blood on my hands ... but if I go down , so do you . Don 't ever forget that . I 'll be in my office . [ Beeps ] [ Disk Drive Clicking ] Come on . Come on . Come on . [ Clicking Continues ] Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . - Ah , Mr. Winston . I 've been looking for you . - Well , here I am . I found a few questionable entries in your expense account deductions ... and I thought maybe after lunch we could go over them . - No . We can 't . - I see . Well , I would hate to bump these up to Collections . I mean , after all , a busy man like yourself - The last thing you need is an audit . - Are you threatening me , Mr. Tally ? - I don 't have to threaten , sir . After all , I am the I.R.S. [ Mr. Parker ] Angel . You said it was urgent . - What is it ? - Daddy , I 'm leaving the Centre . Wh - Leaving ? - This is your home . - It 's the only life you 've ever known . It 's the only life I 've been allowed to know . Ever since I was a little girl , all I 've wanted is to please you . After Mama died , it was my sole reason to live . But I 'm not that little girl anymore . And I won 't be needing this . Uh , this is about the carpenter , right ? - His name is Thomas , and this is about me . - [ Wheels Squeaking ] Daddy , please . Please give me your blessing . [ Brigitte ] That doesn 't seem fair . You agreed to stay here until you captured Jarod . - Which hasn 't yet happened . - I 'm entitled to a life . Come on . Certainly an organization as powerful as the Centre ... can replace one individual . This is much too important to be decided on a whim . It 's not a whim . I know what I want . [ Wheels Squeaking ] This is unacceptable . If you don 't stop her , I will . Don 't you ever threaten my family . Ever . [ Dylan 's Voice ] My dad was a hero ? [ Dylan 's Voice ] My dad was a hero ? He was helping the F.B.I. Build a case against the firm . One of their clients was a drug dealer named Vincent De Paz . He was facing trial for murder . Now , the state had an eyewitness - a woman named Molly Brophy . - Three days before she was supposed to testify - - They killed her . I found these on the Internet . Winston murdered these people to protect a client ? I think so . The trick now is to prove it . That 's why my dad was so afraid . He must have found out about the murders . Dylan , he was trying to do the right thing . I miss him , Jarod . I miss him so much . I know you do . [ Chattering ] All right , what do you want ? Hale ? You 're still alive . - What have you done with my son ? - Dylan is fine . He 's someplace safe . I saw you leave the waterfront with him . You work for Hoyt and Winston . Where is Dylan ? My name is Jarod . I am trying to help you . - Why should I believe you ? - Because your son does . And right now , he is scared , and he is confused because he thinks his father is dead . [ Scoffs ] You don 't know what you 're gettin ' yourself into . I know about the cover-up to protect Vincent De Paz . I know that Molly Brophy and her granddaughters ... and Agent Ashley were all murdered . Now you better talk to me , Peter , because right now , I 'm your last chance . I stumbled on some irregularities in an unrelated case . When I realized what I found , I contacted the F.B.I. - Agent Ashley . - He had me collecting evidence so the feds could build a case ... even bring down De Paz and the firm . And now he 's dead . He had a wife and child . The F.B.I. Thinks his death was an accident . I met with Ashley that morning . I handed over the evidence on De Paz . The next thing I know , Ashley 's dead - the files have disappeared . It was no accident . It was Winston . And I was next . So you staged your own death . I panicked . Winston watches everything . He knows everything . [ Sighs ] I figured the only way out was if he thought I was dead . At least that would buy me the time to get Dylan away from here . Blowing up the boat was the best idea I could come up with . I sealed up the cabin and started filling it with propane gas . I called Dylan 's school - uh , I was gonna have him meet me-but he wasn 't there . I started to worry that something might have already happened to him . I knew Winston was having me watched . Either way , we stood a better chance ifhe thought I was dead ... so I left the note , got back on board . I 'd rigged a flare gun in the cabin . I grabbed a scuba tank and slipped into the water . So , by the time Winston realized that there was no one on the boat ... you and Dylan would be safe with your wife in England . Then when I saw you comin ' out of the firm , I thought I 'd lost my boy for good . Dylan thinks his father is dead . Oh , God . I 've let things get so bad between the two of us . But I did it to protect him . Do you think he 'll ever be able to forgive me ? Why don 't we ask him ? [ Saw Buzzing ] [ Sniffs ] [ Inhales , Exhales ] Nothing like the smell of freshly cut wood . What 's the , uh , spacing code on those support studs ? Uh , two and a half feet . These are not more than 18 inches . That 's bad economics . It 'll double the life of the structure . That 's-That 's all I care about it . A man of integrity . You , uh-You know something about carpentry . I know a little about a lot of things . Could you , uh - Could you hand me a bonding clamp , please ? Hmm . [ Grumbles ] [ Clears Throat ] I guess you 're wondering why I 'm here . She told you she wanted to leave . Your daughter and I don 't keep secrets from each other . Your tools are old . You could use some new ones . - [ Laughs ] - Eh ? Can I help you with something , Mr. Parker ? Hmm . A blank check ? Fill in any amount you want . We shake hands , get on with our lives . All of us . I love your daughter , Mr. Parker . No amount of money in the world could ever change that . - [ Jarod ] Dylan . - [ Hale ] Dylan ? Where is he ? You said he 'd be here . Oh , Jarod . Thank God you came back . - Where 's Dylan ? - [ Rita ] I tried to stop him ... but he was so angry , so upset . He took my Otto 's pistol . - Where would he go ? - He 's going after Winston . - [ Trigger Clicks ] - Give me that . - You can 't stop me . - What about me ? Dad ? - I thought you were dead . - Oh , so did I , when I thought I wouldn 't see you again . I am sorry . I 'm so , so sorry . - I saw the boat explode . - I know . I know none of this makes any sense to you ... but I promise I will fix things so they can be the way they were - the way they should be . - With Mom too ? - Especially with Mom . Come on , you two . We still have a lot of work to do . It doesn 't matter what I do . They 'll never let me go . I don 't understand . You 're a grown woman . Certainly you can make your own decisions . It 's not that simple . - [ Doorbell Rings ] - Who could that be at this hour ? I hope we 're not interrupting anything , angel . No , we were - What are you doing here , Daddy ? Oh , we just stopped by to make sure you were all right . - All right ? - Oh , the hell with it . I wanted to talk to you , sweetheart . Do you mind if we come in ? Sure . - Son of a bitch . - What 's wrong ? - Hale 's still alive . - That 's impossible . This is some kind of a scam . Look at that paper he 's holding . That picture was taken today . [ Scoffs ] According to his letter , it was all a setup . Hale knows about Molly Brophy and the F.B.I. Agent . He wants money to go away . - What else ? - He wants me to meet him in a parking lot . He says to come alone or he tells the F.B.I. The whole story . - [ Sighs ] - What are you going to do ? I 'm gonna meet him . Alone . Then I 'm gonna kill that son of a bitch , once and for all . [ Sighs ] Are you sure I can 't get anybody anything to drink ? No , thank you , Thomas . - Daddy ? - Hmm ? You wanted to talk to me about something ? Ah . I am not young anymore . - Daddy - - No , let me finish . I 'm a creature of habit . I don 't like changes . That 's just the way I am . But I 've been , um , thinking about you and your young friend here ... and uh - [ Sighs ] Well , I 've - I 've been selfish . I don 't understand . The , um , yakuza have a saying ... that love and fear fly to heaven on the same wing ... which means the things we do because we love somebody ... are also the things we do because we 're afraid ... like when Dad tried to pay Thomas to go away . What ? Why didn 't you tell me that ? Because it wasn 't a big deal . He just - He made an error in judgment . That 's all . [ Mr. Parker ] One of many , I 'm afraid . Angel , I am terrified . Of what ? You 're all I have - you and your brother . If you leave , I lose probably the best part of me . But ... if you think leaving is the best for you ... then , uh ... go with my blessing . - Are you serious ? - I just want you to be happy . That 's all I 've ever wanted . Well , it 's late , and , uh , we have to get up early . So , uh , good night , sweetheart . - Thomas . - Yeah . Good night . Well , congratulations , Parker . - Looks like you 're finally in control of your own life . - Yeah . How does it feel ? - Confusing . - I 'll bet . Listen , I 'm gonna go lock the back door . You shut off the lights , okay ? - Okay . - All right . - [ Beeps ] - [ Tires Squealing ] [ Tire Thumping ] [ Sighs ] Damn it . Damn it ! [ Beeping ] [ Out-of-service Tones ] Come on ! - Good evening . How may I help you ? - You got a pay phone ? It 's on the side of the store , but it 's broken . Look , I have a flat tire , and I 'm late for a very important meeting ... - so do you think I could use your phone ? - A local call ? [ Sighs ] Yes . This could be some kind of trick . You might say it 's a local call . Then when the phone bill comes , I see it 's long distance , and I get stuck with the bill . This is a $ 20 bill , okay ? So , now , do you think I could use your phone ? - Make it snappy . - Thank you so much . All right , everybody freeze ! This is a robbery ! - All right , lady , out from behind the counter . - No . - Don 't push me , lady . Get out from behind the counter ! - You get out from my store . - Put the gun down , lady ! - Are you crazy ? Do what he says . No more you rob my store . I fight , or I die . No , no . You 're not gonna fight . You 're gonna lose this one . - Put the gun down . Let these men walk away . - Do what he says ! Put the gun down now . - [ Screams ] - What the hell are you doing ? - Man , I panicked . I 'm sorry . - Go check on her ! I didn 't see anything . - Oh , my God . I killed her . - You stupid idiot ! Sorry , man ! Come on . Let 's get out ofhere . Shut up ! Shut up ! Just shut up ! - Let me think for a second . - I didn 't see anything . Man , you 're so stupid ! - All right , get over there ! Get over there ! - What are you doing ? You just killed someone , ya idiot ! We can 't leave witnesses . - Wait a minute ! You don 't have to kill me . I can help you . - What are you talkin ' about ? Well , you killed somebody ! It 's no big deal . It 's an accident . What do you mean it 's no big deal ? He just killed an old lady . We could fry for this ! No , no ! You 're not gonna fry . You do exactly what I say , and you will walk . Listen to me . I work for one of the top law firms in the city , okay ? - You a lawyer ? I don 't take to lawyers ! - No , no ! I 'm not a lawyer ! - I 'm just like you , all right ? - You are nothin ' like me ! Now get down on your knees ! - You never killed nobody ! - I did ! I killed an old lady in a store just like this , and I walked away . Please ! Please don 't kill me . Please , you gotta believe me . Please ! I believe you . You believe him ? - Yeah , I believe him . - What the hell is this ? - I believe you too . - [ Dylan ] So do I. - [ Winston ] What is this ? - You forgot one thing . You also killed her two granddaughters ... and you killed a federal agent . - Who the hell are you ? - Somebody ... who 's going to turn these tapes over to the F.B.I. Now look , I may have innocent blood on my hands , but if I go down , so do you . Don 't ever forget that . I killed an old lady in a store just like this , and I walked away . Please ! Please don 't kill me . Please , you gotta believe me . Please ! You gotta believe me . It 's kind of a nice ring to it , don 't you think ? - You 're a son of a bitch , you know that ? - Oh , relax . Hey , you never know . Today ... may be your lucky day . What do you say ? Something like that ... or maybe a really big sailboat ? I don 't know , Dad . Maybe we should live on dry land for a while . - [ Chuckles ] - You know , maybe like a little house ? - Maybe you 're right . - [ Jarod ] At least you finish what you started . [ Sighs ] I couldn 't have done any of it without you . Thank you , Jarod . - So what 's next ? - Now I try to put my family back together again . Well , I think a missing piece of that puzzle just pulled up . Mom ! [ Rita Laughing , Shouting ] Rita , what 's wrong ? It 's a miracle ! Lightning just struck my submarine ! That 's great .

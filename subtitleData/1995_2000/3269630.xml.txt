 [ Woman Groans ] I 've got mosquito bites . - I 've got blisters . I hate those new boots . - [ Man ] Honey . Why are you so P.O. ' d ? I thought we had a good time . You had a good time . You had a fine time ... tromping around and leaving me a half a mile behind . For future reference , me running through the woods after you for an entire day ... is not my idea of a good time . I 'm sorry . I 've got longer legs . I was excited , you know ... the great outdoors , communing with nature . - Your head hurt ? - Yeah . You can hit me in the head with a rock if it 'll make you feel better . Fine . Go get one . I 'm taking a shower . [ Screaming ] You still mad at me ? No , I 'm not mad . Come here . So , I guess we 're never going hiking again . It 's indoors forever from now on . Angie , honey , what 's up ? Just hold me . [ Mulder Groans ] I don 't know what they did with the screen for this thing . Now , this is Angela and Wallace Schiff . It 's a young married couple last seen hiking in the vicinity of Brown Mountain , North Carolina . That 's Angie on the right . I should add this is the condition in which their bodies were found ... after being missing for only three days in temperatures that never got above 70 degrees . Which rules out decomposition . I 'd say predation , but the bones would be scattered . Not to mention that these skeletons are not wearing any clothes . Right . Well , I 'd say it looks like a double murder , possibly one with ritualistic overtones . The bodies may have been stripped , then skeletonized , possibly by boiling , or by the use of some kind of acid solution . Maybe the arrangement of the bodies ... has some meaning for the killer or killers . But at any rate , I 'd term it " ritualistic . " That 's a pretty big operation you 're describing . There was no evidence found at the scene ... no tire tracks , no footprints , nothing . Well , what do you think this is ? It 's Brown Mountain , Scully . That doesn 't ring a bell ? The Brown Mountain lights ? It 's a famous atmospheric phenomenon dating back nearly 700 years ... witnessed by thousands of people ... back to the Cherokee Indians . Strange multicolored lights are seen to dance above the peak of the mountain . There 's been no geological explanation , no scientifical credible explanation at all . And what does that have to do with these two ? As I said , there 's been no scientific credible explanation , but there are those of us who believe that these strange multicolored lights are really ... U.F.O. S ? Extraterrestrial visitors ... from beyond who apparently have nothing better to do ... than buzz one mountain over and over again for 700 years ? Sounds like crap when you say it . I 'm just wondering if there 's a connection , Scully . The conditions of these bodies are reminiscent of Southwestern cattle mutilations ... cases where there 's no physical evidence , and they 've been associated with U.F.O. Activity . Mulder , can 't you just for once ... just for the novelty of it ... come up with the simplest explanation , the most logical one , instead of automatically ... jumping to U.F.O. S or Bigfoot or ... Scully , in six years , how ... how often have I been wrong ? - [ Scoffs ] - No , seriously . Every time I bring you a new case we go through this perfunctory dance . You tell me I 'm not being scientifically rigorous and that I 'm off my nut . And then in the end , who turns out to be right like 98.9 % of the time ? I just think I 've ... earned the benefit of the doubt here . We gave ' em adjoining suites . I was ready to send ' em on to Chapel Hill . Figured the state medical examiner should have a look at ' em . We appreciate you holding off . - The connective tissue is more or less intact . - Unlike everything else . I 'm not sure what to make of it , considering the short time frame . If you 'll , um , pardon an obvious question , are you sure that these are the right two bodies ... and not two others that have lain out for six months ? We triple-checked the dental records . Angela and Wallace Schiff ... no doubt about it . Hmm . And they were both found near Brown Mountain , right ? - Where exactly ? - I could write you some directions . Would you , uh , happen to know what this is ? Well , the remains were found in a swampy area . It 's some sort of organic material relating to that . - It 's bog sludge . - I 'm gonna go check out where the bodies were found . - You coming ? - [ Scully ] No . You go ahead . [ Sighs ] [ Car Approaching ] Wallace Schiff ? Wallace Schiff ? We got your gas spectrometer results . That stuff on the bones I said was bog sludge ? It isn 't . Water , hydrochloric acid , electrolytes , pepsins and trypsins . It 's a digestive secretion . It 's stomach juices pretty much ... pretty damn close to it , except for this . Chitinase ? It 's a digestive enzyme as well , but it 's strictly plant , not animal . Hello ! I told you I 'd seen this before . These are the two I remember anyway . Both of these were discovered as skeletal remains . Right , but we saw nothing odd in that . Both were lost hikers found months or years later , or whatever it says there . Says here that the bodies were found not far from where Angela and Wallace Schiff turned up . - [ Dialing ] - [ Line Ringing ] Oh , Mulder , answer your phone . [ Computerized Voice ] The cellular customer you are trying ... Do me a favor . I want you to forward a sample of that secretion ... over to the F.B.I. Lab at Quantico . - I want them to run a complete analysis . - You got it . And , uh , in the meantime , can I borrow your truck ? [ Rustling ] Please . - Don 't take me . - Come out here . Step closer . I won 't hurt you . - You 're not one of them ? - One of who ? Are you Wallace Schiff ? Well , I hate to tell you this , Wallace , but you 're supposed to be dead . They found your skeleton not 200 yards from here . It 's fake . They put it there . Who put it there ? You know who . The Brown Mountain lights . They abducted us ... me and my wife Angela . They took us on board their ... Oh , God ! Wallace ? Wallace ? They found your wife Angela , too , lying right alongside your skeleton . No . Don 't you get it ? They faked our deaths ! They have that kind of technology . Who would be looking for us if they thought they 'd already found our bodies ? You see ? They returned me , but Angela , she 's still up there ... being experimented on and l-l-l-I can 't ... I don 't know what to ... What do I do ? Mulder ? First things first ... we got to find a way out of here . Right behind you . What the hell 's going on ? That was solid rock a minute ago . - Now there 's nothing there . - Oh , God . It 's them . They 're affecting your head . Maybe mine too . - What if I can 't even tell what 's real ? - Let 's get out of here . Come on , Wallace . They 're out there , man . [ Rumbling ] It 's them ! Wallace ! [ Rumbling Continues ] Mulder ? Mulder ! [ Rumbling Continues ] Don 't let them see you ! [ Rumbling Stops ] - They 're gone . - Yeah , for now . - Thank God they didn 't find us . - They should have . Maybe they came for something else . Oh , my God ! - Oh , my God ! Angie ! - [ Moaning ] They brought her back . Angie , can you talk to me ? Do you remember what happened ? Can you tell me ? - It 's all fuzzy and ... - You were with your husband ... with Wallace . There was a light ... a bright light . Where was that light coming from ? From the mountain ? Over Brown Mountain . There were strange lights dancing over the peak and ... and they took me and Wallace too . And then what happened ? Just ... it all went black . And when I woke up , I didn 't know where I was ... and I couldn 't see Wallace anymore . They returned me first . This ... This place that they took you to , can you describe it to me , tell me what it looked like ? It was ... white ... a white place . It was featureless . I was lying on a table ... and I couldn 't get up . I mean , nothing was holding me down , but I couldn 't move . Were there men there ? Yes , there were men ... standing over me , but I couldn 't see their faces . Did they perform tests on you ? Yes , they did tests ... terrible ... tests . You have a ... - You have a scar back here on the back of your neck . - What ? - What scar ? - It 's fresh . - What is that ? - It 's an implant . I 've seen this before . Yes . The drill ... I remember the drill . L ... I couldn 't see it at first . That was the worst part . But I could hear it spinning ... and it was coming out of the light ... - What did they put in me ? - Is there one in me ? No . Male abductees don 't usually report this . And everything she says is textbook down to the last detail , except for one . - What ? - Two skeletons identified as yours and Angie 's ? I don 't understand that . It doesn 't make sense . Maybe they 're like the cattle mutilations you hear about . - Maybe they 're part of their tests . - I had that thought . But there 's no precedent . It 's in none of the literature . Well , they didn 't want anybody to find us . I guess they didn 't want you to know the truth . We got to get out of here right now . - Oh , no way . - They 're out there . They 're always watching . If they fnd us , if we leave , they 'll take us again . We 're leaving right now . Gather your things . Angie , I 'll help you up . They 're coming . I can feel it . [ Rumbling ] - They 're here ! - Hide ! They 'll take you too ! - We 've got to hide ! - No ! No ! - Scully . - Mulder . - Why the hell did you leave North Carolina without telling me ? - Long story . You disappear and then I get a furtive call that you 're back here in D.C. ? - I 'm sorry . Does anybody know you 're here ? - No . - Scully , this is ... - Angela and Wallace Schiff . - But Mulder , it can 't be . - This is my partner , Agent Scully . Mulder , I I.D. ' d their remains myself . Yeah , I think you were meant to . Agent Scully , the aliens planted decoys so you would think we were dead . The aliens ? Scully , I want you to ... put aside your scientific bias for a moment . 'Cause what I 'm about to tell you is gonna change your life forever ... your life , my life , the life of everybody on this planet . - Mulder ... - I was out there ... and I found it . - What ? - The truth . This couple ... they were abducted by a U.F. O ... the Brown Mountain lights . They took me to a white place . There were men there . They put an implant in my neck . Just like what happened to you . Mulder , from what very little I understand about this case , this is not what happened to me . There 's more . It doesn 't like the light . Who ? I abducted him . It 's a gray . It speaks to me . We communicate telepathically . He told me everything . - L ... I can hear him . - Yeah . Oh , my God ! I , uh ... I don 't know what to say , Mulder ... where to begin . I mean , you ... you were right . All these years , you were right . - You think so ? - [ Sighs ] You were right about the grays , about ... about the abductions , about the U.F.O. S , the lights , the Brown Mountain lights ... What about the skeletons ? They were ... They were fake . They were decoys . You 're buying that decoy theory ? What about that organic substance we found on the skeletons ? That goo you were so interested in ? It was nothing . It was bog sludge . That , uh , doesn 't sound like you , Scully . It , uh ... God , I can 't believe you 're buying this . Mulder , I 'm admitting that I was wrong . Are ... Are you all right ? [ Water Stops Running ] - How are you feeling ? - [ Groans ] - This doesn 't make any sense . - What ? These two , their story , their skeletons , none of it . Mulder , if I , of all people , can believe this , then why can 't you ? - Did you go inside the cave ? - Yeah , I looked . It 's empty . It 's as if he just vanished . He 's got to be around . We 'll catch up to him . I know this area pretty well . Doctor . It 's more of that digestive material . Looks like it 's coming up from out of the ground . Agent Scully ? I got tracks going in and out . They were only going in before . - I guess you missed him . - How ? I mean , this cave 's not much more than a hole in the rock . Agent Scully ? [ Door Opens ] The courier just arrived . They brought your partner 's charts . I 'm sorry . I know it 's difficult . That , um ... That digestive secretion that we keep finding , could it ... could it have done this to him ? I 'm not sure I follow . Well , it 's ... it 's chemically similar to gastric juices , right ? I mean , maybe he fell in it or ... maybe it 's a product of a particular vegetation that grows in the area . That ... all sounds plausible , I guess , except for one thing . There 's no sign of it on these remains . It was ... It was on the Schiffs . I just think we need to look for the simplest explanation ... the most logical . What is the most logical explanation ? I 'd say we 're looking at a murder ... one with ritualistic overtones . I think his body was stripped ... and then skeletonized , possibly by boiling or use of an acid solution . Don 't worry , Agent . We 'll take care of the arrangements . What arrangement ? We 'll have the remains sent on to Washington . I appreciate the thoroughness of your report , especially given the circumstances . It might be best if you took some time off ... a short leave . Agent ? Sir ? You 're satisfied with my conclusions in this case ? Absolutely . - I take it you 're not . - [ Scoffs ] I was unable to determine a clear cause of death , nor was I able to fully account for the condition of Agent Mulder 's body . You concluded he was a victim of a ritual killing . No . I mean that was one possible scenario that I mentioned , but in my mind it ... it was the least plausible . Not only is it plausible , it 's ... it 's , uh ... it 's likely . Why are you questioning your own findings ? My role in the X-Files has always been to provide ... a rational scientific perspective ... to cases that would seem to defy explanation ... a counterpoint to Agent Mulder . And you have done that . - You have performed admirably . - Have I ? How many X-Files has my scientifc approach ... fully and satisfactorily explained ? Your reports have consistently made sense of his conclusions . Sir , this one makes no sense at all . Are you suggesting this is anything other than a murder ? That 's what Agent Mulder would have thought . You think he would have been right ? [ Sighs ] Given Mulder 's life work , it 's tempting to attribute his death to the paranormal ... the unexplained , the unknown ... but that 's simply not the case here . You need to see this for what it is . And given that , I promise you we 'll get the bastard who did this . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] I 'm sorry . Agent Scully , how are you holding up ? I , uh ... I still can 't believe it . Neither can we . I half expect Mulder to come knocking at that door . - " Surprise . " - This will dull the pain . No , thank you . Just so you know , we 've launched our own investigation . I was beginning to think that I was the only one who was at all suspicious . We 'll find him . We 'll find him and we 'll make him pay . - Find who ? - The son of a bitch who killed Mulder . I hope you 're not offended , but we , uh , managed to get a hold of your report . I must say , we were impressed by the thoroughness of it . - Especially given the circumstances . - I don 't understand . We concur with your findings . Clearly , this was a ritualistic murder . Those were not my findings . You guys believe that , too ... that Mulder was murdered ? - It 's the obvious answer . - No , it is not the obvious answer ! We believe his body was stripped , then skeletonized , possibly by boiling ... or the use of an acid solution . - We 'll make that monkey pay . - What the hell is wrong with everybody ? You guys , there are unanswered questions here ! Am I the only one that 's asking them ? I could use a drink . You three , of all people , should be all over this , not buying the party line . Something else is going on here . Am I the only one who thinks that ? - [ Exasperated Sigh ] - Are you all right ? I think you need to go home and get some rest . I 'll call you a cab . What have you done with him ? Scully , you 're emotionally distraught . You need to calm down and get some rest . Where is Mulder ? What have you done with him ? Listen to me . He 's gone . You need to accept that . Something else is going on here ! Where is he ? Where 's Mulder ? [ Knocking At Door ] [ Knocking Continues ] Scully . We were in the cave when the light came . It was a blinding ... blue-white light . And then they took me . I was abducted . I found myself in some kind of medical bay . It was white , featureless . It was just as the Schiffs had described it . - Mulder , the Schiffs are dead . - No , actually , they 're not . Mulder , their remains were discovered in a field . That 's ... That 's what brought us to this case in the first place . I found your remains in that same field . Look at me . I 'm here . How did you get here ? Aliens brought me back here . From North Carolina direct to your apartment door ? Mulder , you don 't remember getting here , do you ? Neither do I. It doesn 't change what happened . Mulder , why did you knock ? This is your apartment . And you don 't seem the least bit surprised to fnd me here . And what about the Schiffs ? I mean , if they 're ... if they 're alive , as you say , then ... then where are they ... where 'd they go ? Mulder , five minutes ago ... this room was filled with people attending your wake . Well , what can I say , Scully ? I 'm here . I 'm real . Mulder , this is not reality . This is a hallucination . It has to be . And either I am having it or you are having it or we are having it together . - Brought on by what ? - Something that we found in that field , Mulder , because that 's where it began . Wild mushroom . Wild mushrooms , Mulder . They were growing there . I stepped on one and it gave off spores . Several varieties of mushrooms are known for their hallucinogenic properties . - If we inhaled it ... - Whatever happened to the most logical explanation ? This is it , Mulder . What if we 're still there ... if we 're still in that cave in North Carolina ? That we 're not here in this apartment right now ? - Whoa , Scully . - Mulder , bear with me . I think this is making sense . I think that Angela and Wallace Schiff ... were digested by that substance that I found all over that field . That they were dissolved and then expelled up out of the ground . What if that substance ... and this hallucinogen are from one and the same organism ? - A giant mushroom ? - A giant fungal organism , Mulder . We already know that they exist . Biologists have found specimens that range dozens of acres ... that weigh hundreds of tons . And what if this one needs to feed on living tissue ? There is carnivorous plant life . There 's the Venus flytrap and the pitcher plant . Mulder , what if this one puts off a hallucinogen ... - To lure its prey into the cave ? - To make it complacent ... to keep it still while it devours it . [ Gasps ] What if we 're still underground , Mulder ? What if we 're moving deeper into the cave , or being moved ? Mulder , what if we 're being digested ? Right now . [ Coughing ] The exact size of this organism has yet to be determined ? [ Scully ] That 's correct , sir . We know that the organism extends for at least ten acres . Though it 's mostly subterranean , so it may be far larger . We 've contacted Fish and Wildlife . We 've contacted the North Carolina State Health Department ... as well as the local F.B.I. Field office in Raleigh . And we 've contacted a mycologist at the Smithsonian for good measure . We think we have our bases covered . The lab results determined that the spores we were exposed to ... have a chemical structure similar to L.S.D. They also contain an alkaloid which induces a state of narcosis . It 's a rare day when the two of you sign off on the same report . Agent Mulder ? I 'm just thinking . Uh , I 'm not exactly clear on how we escaped . - What 's not clear ? - Once you recognized we were under a chemical influence , then it simply kind of ... broke its spell ? - That 's right . - Scully , how could we simply ... will ourselves out of a chemical hallucination ? - Well , the fact remains we did . - Did we ? Can you name me one drug that loses its effect once the user realizes it 's in his system ? I assume the effects wore off to the point you were able to make your escape . How long were we underground ... hours , half a day ? How come our bodies don 't show effects of being burned by the digestive fluids ? We were covered in hydrochloric acid , yet look at our skin . Nothing . Agent Mulder , where are you going with this ? Scully , we never escaped . We 're still trapped underground . Mulder , we did escape . - I think you 're suffering from post-traumatic stress . - No , I 'm not . This is not real . You ... you 're not real . [ Scoffs ] Mulder , I ... I 'll prove it , Scully . I 'll prove it . Mulder ! [ Liquid Dripping ] [ Skinner ] Over here ! [ Men Shouting ] Hey ! Rescue , over here ! - He 's alive . - Hurry up ! Get him out ! Get him out ! Keep digging ! She 's down here ! Pull her up . Get her out ! - Mushroom . - We found it . Just take it easy , Agent . [ Child ] I made this !

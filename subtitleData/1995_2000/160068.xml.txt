 Gideon : PERSONAL JOURNAL , CAPTAIN MATTHEW GIDEON , CONTINUED . IT 'S NOW 3 DAYS SINCE OUR VISITORS ARRIVED ON BEHALF OF EARTHGOV 'S POLITICAL AFFAIRS OFFICE . THERE 'S APPARENTLY SOME CONCERN ABOUT HOW OUR WORK HERE IS BEING PERCEIVED BACK HOME . THEY 'VE BEEN ASSIGNED TO ... HELP US . BEFORE THEIR TOUR IS FINISHED , I MAY HAVE TO KILL THEM , ASSUMING LIEUTENANT MATHESON DOESN 'T BEAT ME TO IT . BUT IT 'S JUST TOO LIGHT , THAT 'S ALL . IT DOESN 'T HAVE ANY WEIGHT TO IT . AND , UH ... WHAT 'S THAT , KEVIN ? WELL , IT 'S JUST ... ALL THIS . THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MISSION , VITAL TO THE SALVATION OF EARTH . PEOPLE SEE THIS SHIP ON THE NEWS , IN STORIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO REASSURE EVERYONE ABOUT HOW YOU 'RE TRYING TO SAVE EVERYONE BACK HOME FROM THIS TERRIBLE PLAGUE . AND ? WELL , LOOK AROUND YOU . THE COLORS ... ARE TOO BRIGHT . THEY DON 'T SAY " POWER " TO ME . THEY DON 'T SAY ... " IMPORTANCE " TO ME . THEY SAY ... " DAY AT THE CIRCUS . " IT 'LL ALL HAVE TO BE REDONE . RE-WHAT ? I 'LL HAVE MY OWN PEOPLE DO IT , OF COURSE . I WOULDN 'T TRUST ANYONE ELSE . WE 'LL CHOOSE A COLOR PALETTE THAT 'S MORE ... PALATABLE . HEH . A PALATABLE PALETTE . IT 'S A ... A PALATABLE PALETTE . IT 'S A ... ANYWAY , YOU WON 'T EVEN KNOW WE 'RE HERE . THAT 'S RIGHT . BECAUSE YOU WON 'T BE . I CAN 'T HAVE STRANGERS MESSING- - CAPTAIN , I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN , BUT THIS MISSION IS STILL UNDER EARTH JURISDICTION . SINCE WE 'RE PAYING THE BILLS FOR THIS LITTLE HAIL MARY ACROSS THE STARS , WE HAVE A RIGHT TO TAKE WHATEVER STEPS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE EFFORT HAS THE RIGHT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT . IMPACT ! THAT 'S THE VERY WORD . THE PLAGUE IS ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEM , CAPTAIN . THE REST IS PANIC . WE STILL HAVE 4 YEARS IN WHICH TO FIND A CURE . THE PANIC IS A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW . WE 'VE HAD ... RIOTS BACK HOME . DOOMSDAY CULTS . YOU NAME IT . THE ONLY THING THAT 'S CALMED THEM DOWN IS KNOWING THIS SHIP IS OUT THERE LOOKING FOR A CURE . NOW , WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP MAKE THE FOLKS BACK HOME FEEL BETTER ABOUT THIS MISSION AND THEIR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL . TRUST ME ON THIS ONE , CAPTAIN . IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO SURVIVE POLITICAL CHANGES , IT 'S ME . SO ... IF A LITTLE PAINT , THE PROPER PRESENTATION DOES THE JOB , GREAT . I PROMISE WE WON 'T GET IN THE WAY , AND AT EVERY STAGE , WE WELCOME YOUR INPUT . INPUT ? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING- - CAPTAIN , WE 'RE PICKING UP SOMETHING ON THE LONG-RANGE SCANNERS . SOURCE UNKNOWN . THIS IS GETTING TOO INTENSE FOR ME . Gideon : IT 'S A FIRST-CONTACT SITUATION . WE 'VE HANDLED THEM BEFORE . I MEANT THE COLORS . SO IF YOU 'LL EXCUSE ME , I 'M GOING BACK DOWN TO LOOK AT THE UNIFORMS AGAIN . UNIF- - UNIF- - DISTANCE TO TARGET . 2,000 KILOMETERS . LET ME SEE IT . BRING UP LONG-RANGE SCANNERS . AYE , SIR . AYE , SIR . HOLY ... HOLY ... ARE WE GETTING ANY LIFE FORMS ? JUST ONE . BARELY . IT DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . A SHIP THAT BIG WOULD NEED A CREW OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE . IT DOES . WE 'RE PICKING UP ONE LIFE SIGN , BUT WELL OVER 1,000 ORGANICS . EVERYONE ELSE ON THE SHIP IS DEAD . IT 'S PRACTICALLY A GHOST SHIP . IT 'S PRACTICALLY A GHOST SHIP . MATTHEW GIDEON , CAPTAIN . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . ATTACHED TO THE EARTH ALLIANCE STARSHIPEXCALIBUR . TO FIND A CURE TO THE DRAKH PLAGUE BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . BEFORE IT WIPES OUT ALL LIFE ON EARTH . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . ANYWHERE I HAVE TO . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS . Questioner : WHO DO YOU SERVE ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? Matheson : E.V.A. TEAM STANDING BY , CAPTAIN . Gideon : ROGER THAT , LIEUTENANT . YOU 'RE CLEAR TO PROCEED . WE 'RE MOVING OUT OF THE AIR LOCK NOW . WE 'RE MOVING OUT OF THE AIR LOCK NOW . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WHY ARE WE STOPPING FOR THIS ? OUR MANDATE IS TO EXPLORE ANY POSSIBLE SOURCE FOR A CURE . IT DOESN 'T MATTER IF IT 'S A ... A LOST CITY , A NEW CIVILIZATION , OR A DERELICT ALIEN SHIP . IF IT 'S A FIRST CONTACT SITUATION , WE GO IN . BUT THE ODDS OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEING OF ANY USE ... WHO WOULD 'VE THOUGHT TO LOOK FOR PENICILLIN IN BREAD MOLD ? Matheson : I 'M NOT SEEING ANY RECOGNIZABLE MARKINGS ... NO SIGN OF MISSILE OR HIGH-ENERGY BEAM IMPACTS ... SO MY GUESS IS SHE WASN 'T HIT BY RAIDERS OR ... SO MY GUESS IS SHE WASN 'T HIT BY RAIDERS OR ... STAND BY . WE FOUND SOMETHING , CAPTAIN . Gideon : WHAT IS IT ? THERE 'S A LARGE OPENING AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP . LOOKS LIKE AN EXPLOSION . THEN THE SHIP WAS ATTACKED . Matheson : NEGATIVE . THE BLAST DAMAGE IS COMING FROM THE INSIDE OUT . WHATEVER HAPPENED HERE , IT HAPPENED INSIDE . DO WE MOVE IN ? AFFIRMATIVE . BUT GO SLOW , AND DON 'T TAKE ANY CHANCES . IF YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE , GET THE HELL OUT . WILL DO . MOVING INSIDE . WILL DO . MOVING INSIDE . WE APPEAR TO BE IN THE ENGINEERING SECTION NOW . SINCE THE JUMP ENGINES ARE BACK THE WAY WE CAME , THIS SHOULD LEAD US OUT INTO THE MAIN BODY OF THE SHIP . THIS SHOULD LEAD US OUT INTO THE MAIN BODY OF THE SHIP . MY GOD . Gideon : WHAT IS IT ? WE 'VE REACHED THE MAIN CHAMBER AND FOUND THE CREW . IT 'S HARD TO TELL- - THEY 'VE ALL BEEN EXPOSED TO HARD VACUUM- - BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY 'VE BEEN DEAD FOR LESS THAN A WEEK . DR. CHAMBERS WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN I COULD . WHAT KILLED THEM ? WHAT KILLED THEM ? IT LOOKS LIKE THEY KILLED EACH OTHER . MUTINY ? I CAN 'T TELL . MAYBE . BUT IN THAT CASE , WHAT BLEW UP THE ENGINES ? IF IT WAS A MUTINY , DESTROYING THE SHIP WOULDN 'T BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF EITHER SIDE . WELL , MAYBE IT HAPPENED DURING THE FIGHT WHEN NO ONE WAS MINDING THE STORE . MAYBE . WE 'VE FOUND ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY . THIS ONE MIGHT LEAD TO THE COMMAND DECK . MOVING ON . MOVING ON . WE 'VE FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE SIGNAL . WE 'VE FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE SIGNAL . WE ARE REGISTERING ONE LIFE FORM ... WE ARE REGISTERING ONE LIFE FORM ... AND A WHOLE LOT OF DEAD ONES . AND A WHOLE LOT OF DEAD ONES . EQUALIZE THE PRESSURE IN THERE . JANEY , DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT AIR MIX ? I THINK SO , DOCTOR . DON 'T THINK . GET IT RIGHT . I 'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING ON THE MAIN SCANNERS , AND WHAT I 'M GETTING ON THE OTHERS DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . HOW LONG UNTIL YOU CAN CRACK THE TUBE ? WE HAD TO MAKE SURE IT WAS DECONTAMINATED FIRST . THAT 'S DONE NOW . WE CAN SEND IN A TEAM IN PRESSURE SUITS ANYTIME . DOCTOR , WE 'RE LOSING HIM . GETTING MASSIVE CORONARY DISRUPTION , TOTAL SHUTDOWN . WHAT ? WE JUST HAD HIM STABILIZED 2 MINUTES AGO . I KNOW . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WE NEED A DEFIBRILLATOR TEAM IN THERE . THEY 'RE SUITING UP . 2 MINUTES . THERE ISN 'T TIME ! JANEY ! JANEY ! [ AIR HISSING ] Janey : I 'M CRACKING THE TUBE . Janey : I 'M CRACKING THE TUBE . JANEY ! JANEY ! JANEY ! JANEY ! IT 'S NO GOOD . WE LOST HIM . WE LOST HIM . Medtech : MARK THE TIME . ALL RIGHT . I WANT AN AUTOPSY ASAP BEFORE THE BODY STARTS TO DECOMPOSE . AT LEAST WE 'LL GET SOME INFORMATION OUT OF IT . AND YOU ... I WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH FULL DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE BEFORE YOU COME OUT OF THERE . INCLUDING BODY CAVITY DECON . MAYBE WE 'LL GET LUCKY AND FIND OUT WHERE YOUR COPY OF MEDLAB REGULATIONS WENT . YES , DOCTOR . YES , DOCTOR . DAMN IT ! HE SHOULDN 'T HAVE DIED . WE HAD HIM STABILIZED . ONE MINUTE HE WAS FINE , THE NEXT , TOTAL SYSTEMIC SHUTDOWN . IT 'S ALMOST AS IF HE WILLED HIMSELF TO DIE . IT DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . HE SENT OUT A DISTRESS SIGNAL , SO HE WANTED TO BE SAVED . WHY CHOOSE TO DIE ? I DON 'T KNOW . MAYBE SOME CULTURAL IMPERATIVE AGAINST BEING HELPED BY ANOTHER RACE . OR MAYBE HE DIDN 'T LIKE THE DECOR . WELL , HE WASN 'T THE FIRST PERSON TODAY TO MAKE THAT OBSERVATION . EITHER WAY ... NOW WE 'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT SHIP . NOT NECESSARILY . MATHESON WAS ABLE TO FIND SOME DATA CRYSTALS ON BOARD . WITH LUCK , THEY MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS . MAYBE . MATT , I 'M SORRY . YOU DID ALL YOU COULD . NOW , ONE THING- - YOU SAID THAT WHAT YOU WERE GETTING ON THE MAIN SCANNERS DIDN 'T MAKE SENSE . YEAH . ALL I CAN FIGURE IS THE EQUIPMENT NEEDS RECALIBRATION . SEE , WHEN I LOOKED AT HIS BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS , HE ... SEE , WHEN I LOOKED AT HIS BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS , HE ... YOU EVER STAND IN A ROOM WITH MIRRORS ON ALL 4 WALLS , SO THE REFLECTIONS GO ON INTO INFINITY , ONE INTO THE OTHER INTO THE OTHER ? YEAH . WELL , THAT 'S WHAT I SAW WHEN I LOOKED INSIDE HIS HEAD . MULTIPLE E.E.G. READOUTS , AND THAT 'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE . AND THAT 'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE . SO IT 'S NOT ... A MATHEMATICALLY BASED LANGUAGE . RANDOM CONSONANTS . NOT GOOD . ALWAYS TAKES LONGER . NOT GOOD . ALWAYS TAKES LONGER . EXCUSE ME . CAN I HAVE SOME MORE OF THESE , WHATEVER THEY ARE , PLEASE ? SALTED . I WORK BETTER WITH SALT . DID YOU KNOW THAT IN THE 20th CENTURY THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT SALT WAS BAD FOR YOU ? LISTEN TO THE ANIMALS , I SAY . THE LION WILL SIT DOWN WITH THE LAMB TO SHARE THE SALT LICK . GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM , GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME . GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM , GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME . A TOTAL LACK OF PRONOUNS , NOTHING TO COMPARE IT AGAINST . NEVER A ROSETTA STONE WHEN YOU NEED ONE . NEVER A ROSETTA STONE WHEN YOU NEED ONE . LOAD VISUAL RECORDS OF LIEUTENANT MATHESON 'S LOGS OF THE ALIEN SHIP . OF LIEUTENANT MATHESON 'S LOGS OF THE ALIEN SHIP . [ SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ] [ SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ] MORNING , MAX . CAPTAIN . YOU 'RE UP EARLY . NEVER WENT DOWN . YOU 'VE BEEN WORKING HERE ALL NIGHT ? WHY ? YOU 'VE BEEN WORKING HERE ALL NIGHT ? WHY ? THERE 'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I HATE , CAPTAIN . I HATE IT WHEN I PULL UP A PIECE OF SKIN NEXT TO MY NAIL AND IT CATCHES EVERY TIME I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND IT HURTS LIKE A SON OF A GUN . I HATE IT WHEN I GO TO MOVIES WITH KIDS IN THE AUDIENCE BECAUSE THERE 'S ALWAYS SOMEONE THERE THAT TELLS ME I CAN 'T KILL THEM WHEN THEY GET LOUD . NOW , WHO MAKES UP THESE RULES , ANYWAY ? AND MOST OF ALL , I HATE CONTRADICTIONS . THIS IS A CONTRADICTION . A BIG ONE . HOW SO ? WELL , I 'VE BEEN ANALYZING THE SPOKEN RECORDS OF THE ALIEN SHIP ALL NIGHT , AND I 'VE--I 'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO 94 BASIC LETTERS AND ... 114 BASIC LANGUAGE COMPONENTS . THAT 'S GOOD . EXCEPT THAT THE SPOKEN RECORD HAS NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE WORDS WE FOUND WRITTEN INSIDE THE SHIP . NOW , EITHER THEY HAVE ONE LANGUAGE FOR SPEAKING AND ONE LANGUAGE FOR WRITING , WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY , OR ELSE- - OR WHAT ? OR SOMEONE ELSE OTHER THAN THE ALIENS WROTE ALL THIS . WROTE ALL THIS . BUT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE THERE . EXACTLY . SO WHO OR WHAT DREW THESE FIGURES ? EXACTLY . SO WHO OR WHAT DREW THESE FIGURES ? Sprach : I MEAN , LOOK AT IT . JUSTLOOKAT IT . I DIDN 'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THE CAPTAIN , HE 'S SO RESISTANT TO NEW IDEAS , BUT YOU CAN 'T EXPECT ANYONE TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY WEARING THIS . MIGHT AS WELL BE A MECHANIC . IT 'S A STANDARD ISSUE UNIFORM FOR CREWS OF EXPLORER SHIPS AND OTHER DEEP-RANGE VESSELS . IT ALLOWS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT , IT COULD BE ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT CLIMATES , IT HAS OUTSIDE POCKETS . AN OFFICER DOESN 'T NEED POCKETS . HE CAN HAVE PEOPLE CARRY HIS THINGS FOR HIM . WHERE 'S THE REST OF IT ? COME , COME , COME , COME , QUICKLY , QUICKLY . COME , COME , COME , COME , QUICKLY , QUICKLY . BLUE IS WRONG FOR THESE . BLUE IS WRONG FOR THESE . HERE , TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . LATER . WHAT ? BUT WE 'VE JUST BEGUN SORTING- - I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO RIGHT NOW . MORE IMPORTANT ? WHAT 'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RIGHT CLOTHES FOR THE RIGHT JOB , THE RIGHT STYLE FOR THE RIGHT ... [ SIGHS ] OH , I TRY . GOODNESS KNOWS I TRY , BUT IT 'S JUST SO HARD SOME DAYS . BUT IT 'S JUST SO HARD SOME DAYS . WHY , YES , WE WERE GONNA ALL , YOU KNOW , TAKE THE TRANSPORT AND LEAVE AND ... KIRA ? KIRA ... KIRA ... Eilerson : YES ! YES ! I KNEW THAT WOULD WORK . THIS IS THE CAPTAIN 'S LOG , YOU SEE . WHAT WOULD A CAPTAIN TALK ABOUT MORE THAN HIS SHIP ? HIS SHIP . SO THE EQUIVALENT WORD FOR " SHIP " WOULD BE THE MOST COMMON WORD IN THE LOG . ONCE YOU 'VE ESTABLISHED THAT , THEN YOU GO TO " MY SHIP , " " THEIR SHIP , " AND IT ALL STARTS FALLING INTO PLACE . AHH ... GOD , I 'M GOOD . DISPLAY LAST RECORDS , TEXT ONLY . DISPLAY LAST RECORDS , TEXT ONLY . HOLY ... HOLY ... EILERSON TO GIDEON . GIDEON HERE . I 'LL MEET YOU IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM IN 10 MINUTES . I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING . IN 10 MINUTES . I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING . [ ALIEN SCREECH ] [ ALIEN SCREECH ] HOLD THAT DOOR ! HELP ME ! HOLD THAT DOOR ! HOLD THAT DOOR ! EILERSON , WHAT THE HELL 'S GOING ON DOWN THERE ? I 'VE HAD REPORTS OF WEAPONS FIRE . WE GOT A GUARD DOWN IN HERE . HE 'S BEEN SHOT , AND WE WILL NEED MEDICS . WHAT HAPPENED ? THERE 'S NO TIME . JUST LISTEN . YOU 'VE GOT TO CLOSE DOWN ALL THE DECKS . SEAL THE AIR DOORS , TURN OFF THE BULLET CAR . DECOMPRESS THE TUBES IF YOU HAVE TO , BUT YOU GOT SEAL OFF ALL THE DECKS . DON 'T LET ANYONE OUT- - EXCEPT ME ! MAKE SURE THIS CAR GETS OUT . MAKE SURE THIS CAR GETS OUT . HOW 'S THE GUARD ? ON LIFE SUPPORT , BUT I 'M NOT GETTING ANY BRAIN ACTIVITY . WE CAN KEEP HIS BODY ALIVE , BUT THAT 'S ABOUT ALL . LOOK , WHAT 'S THIS ALL ABOUT ? WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE ? WHY ARE THE DECKS SEALED OFF ? MAX ? AS I WAS JUST TELLING THE CAPTAIN , WE HAVE BEEN INVADED . ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS OF THE ALIEN SHIP , THEY PICKED UP A PROBE , THEY BROUGHT IT ON BOARD . THE ONLY THING INSIDE WAS A HIGH-ENERGY SOURCE , ORGANIC IN NATURE . IT DISAPPEARED AFTER THEY OPENED THE PROBE , AND THAT 'S WHEN PEOPLE STARTED CHANGING . CHANGING HOW ? PHYSICALLY ? MENTALLY . INSIDE . APPARENTLY , THE ENERGY CONTAINS AN ALIEN LIFE FORCE THAT DIVIDES AND SUBDIVIDES EACH TIME IT MOVES INTO A NEW HOST . IT 'S--IT 'S TRANSFERRED ... IT 'S TRANSFERRED BY TOUCH ... FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER . IN A MATTER OF DAYS , IT TOOK OVER HALF OF THEIR CREW . THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE MULTIPLE BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS ON THE ALIEN WE FOUND . APPARENTLY , THIS ALIEN PRESENCE TENDS TO STAY IN GROUPS , IN--IN COLONIES . THEY TAKE CONTROL OF ONE AREA , AND THEN THEY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT . BY SEALING OFF THE DECKS , WE CAN CONTROL HOW FAST THIS THING SPREADS . GOOD THINKING , MAX . THANK YOU , BUT NOT MY IDEA . IN THESE RECORDS I 'M DECODING , IT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT THE CAPTAIN CHOSE TO DO WHEN HE REALIZED THAT THIS WAS TAKING OVER HIS SHIP . HE STILL THOUGHT THAT HE COULD CONTAIN IT . ALL HE DID WAS BUY HIMSELF SOME TIME . IN THE END , HE DECIDED THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THIS THING WAS TO DESTROY THE SHIP AND KILL EVERYONE ON BOARD . AND IF WE DON 'T FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STOP IT ... WE MAY HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING . WE MAY HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING . [ LOW CONVERSATIONS ] [ LOW CONVERSATIONS ] EVERYTHING SEEMS NORMAL . DECK 8 LOOKS CLEAR . ALL RIGHT . OPEN UP A P.A. CHANNEL ON 8 . OPEN UP A P.A. CHANNEL ON 8 . Crewmember : CHANNEL OPEN . THIS IS THE CAPTAIN . YOU ARE ALL ORDERED TO REMAIN IN YOUR QUARTERS UNTIL TOLD OTHERWISE . REFRAIN FROM ANY CONTACT WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CREW UNTIL THE CURRENT SITUATION IS RESOLVED . ACTIVATING RECORDER ON DECKS 9 AND 10 . ACTIVATING RECORDER ON DECKS 9 AND 10 . IS THAT THE SAME WRITING THAT YOU FOUND ON THE ALIEN SHIP ? AYE , SIR . DAMN . EILERSON WAS RIGHT ABOUT ALL THIS . I HATE IT WHEN HE 'S RIGHT . HE 'LL BE INSUFFERABLE FOR DAYS . HAS THERE BEEN ANY SIGN OF THE CREW ? NEGATIVE . EITHER THEY 'RE STAYING IN THEIR QUARTERS OR THEY 'RE DELIBERATELY AVOIDING THE RECORDER . WAIT . WAIT , HOLD UP . WAIT . WAIT , HOLD UP . HELLO , CAPTAIN . I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU 'D SHOW UP . WE SHOULD TALK . ABOUT WHAT ? ABOUT NEGOTIATING A PEACEFUL WAY OUT OF THIS . BECAUSE OTHERWISE , NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OF YOUR CREW ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE . ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE . [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] MAX . MAX . ARE YOU OK ? NOT REALLY . BUT BETTER THAN HIM . IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR HIM ? ANYTHING AT ALL ? I 'M AFRAID NOT . HE TOOK A SHOT TO THE BRAINSTEM THAT SEVERED ALL- - THAT SEVERED ALL- - ALL WE CAN DO IS KEEP HIS BODY ALIVE . HE WAS PROTECTING ME WHEN THIS HAPPENED . HE WAS PROTECTING ME WHEN THIS HAPPENED . HE STEPPED RIGHT INTO THE LINE OF FIRE . HE DIDN 'T FLINCH , HE DIDN 'T THINK TWICE . HE JUST DID IT . THAT 'S WHAT THEY 'RE TRAINED TO DO . INTELLECTUALLY I KNOW THAT , BUT NO ONE HAS EVER ... SAVED MY LIFE LIKE THIS BEFORE , OFFERING TO EXCHANGE HIS OWN LIFE FOR MINE . I 'VE BEEN STANDING HERE WONDERING , IF HE HAD KNOWN THE SUBJECT OF HIS ATTENTION , WHETHER HE WOULD STILL CONSIDER THE EXCHANGE WORTHWHILE . I DON 'T THINK ANY OF THEM CAN LOOK AT IT THAT WAY . THEY LOOK FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE , TO PROTECT US AND THE MISSION . THAT 'S WHAT HE WAS HERE FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE . THEY JOIN THE MILITARY LOOKING TO SERVE WITH HONOR . THEY JOIN THE MILITARY LOOKING TO SERVE WITH HONOR . HE DID THAT . YOU KNOW , NO ONE 'S EVEN TOLD ME HIS NAME . YOU KNOW , NO ONE 'S EVEN TOLD ME HIS NAME . GREENBERG . GREENBERG . STUART GREENBERG . STUART GREENBERG . IT 'S A GOOD NAME . IT 'S A GOOD NAME . YES , IT IS . YES , IT IS . DID YOU CONTACT WELLES , GIVE HIM THE LOCATION OF OUR TALK ? I DID . WE 'VE GOT SECURITY PERSONNEL WELDING SHUT THE AIR LOCK NOW . I STILL THINK IT 'S TOO DANGEROUS . IT 'S A CALCULATED RISK . I 'VE BEEN STUDYING THE REPORT OF THE ATTACK ON EILERSON . IF THEY COULD TAKE CONTROL OF SOMEONE JUST BASED ON LINE OF SIGHT OR PROXIMITY , THEY WOULD 'VE DONE SO . BUT YOU CAN SEE THEM REACHING OUT , TRANSFERRING THE ALIEN PRESENCE BY TOUCH . AS LONG AS WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN 'T TOUCH ME ... I SHOULD BE FINE . WELL , IT 'S THE " SHOULD " THAT BOTHERS ME . IT 'S NOT 100 % . NOTHING EVER IS , LIEUTENANT . ALL RIGHT . LET 'S GET THIS DONE . ALL RIGHT . LET 'S GET THIS DONE . I 'M HERE . I 'M HERE . CAPTAIN ... GOOD OF YOU TO COME . WHO ... WHO ... WHAT ARE YOU ? WE DON 'T HAVE NAMES AS YOU DO . THERE IS THE ONE , THE BEGINNING OF US , AND WE WHO ARE THE SHADOWS OF THAT BEGINNING . AS OUR RACE GREW , WE BEGAN TO SEND OUT PROBES THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO COLONIZE OTHER WORLDS , NOT BY TRAVELING OURSELVES , BUT MAKING THOSE PLACES ... JUST LIKE US . SO INSTEAD OF TERRAFORMING THE PLANET , YOU TERRAFORM THE PEOPLE ... PASS ALONG YOUR RACE MEMORIES AND MAKE THEM INTO COLONIES . AND WHAT THEY HAVE , WE HAVE . WHY RISK OURSELVES WHEN WE CAN PROGRAM OTHERS TO BECOME US ? SO WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US ? TRANSPORTATION . THAT 'S ALL . THERE ARE SEVERAL INHABITED WORLDS IN THIS AREA . TAKE US TO ONE OF THEM , AND WE 'LL LEAVE PEACEFULLY . YOU CAN GO ON YOUR WAY . WHILE YOU TAKE OVER THEIR WORLD . THAT WOULD BE THE INEVITABLE RESULT . ONCE OUR KIND IS INTRODUCED INTO THE POPULATION , THERE IS NO WAY OF STOPPING US WITHOUT KILLING EVERYONE . AND WE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN . OUR INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION IS QUITE STRONG . SO , IN OTHER WORDS , EXCHANGE SOMEONE ELSE 'S WORLD FOR MY SHIP . IT SEEMS A FAIR TRADE . IT SEEMS A FAIR TRADE . NO DEAL . THE PRICE TAG IS TOO HIGH . I DON 'T THINK YOU HAVE A CHOICE , CAPTAIN . YOU 'VE SEALED US OFF , BUT WE 'RE STILL HERE . IF YOU STARVE US , YOU 'LL ONLY KILL THE POOR , INNOCENT CREWMEMBERS WHOSE BODIES WE INHABIT . IF YOU SEND IN YOUR TROOPS , THEY WILL LEAVE ASOURTROOPS . YOUR ONLY WAY OUT IS TO MAKE US SOMEONE ELSE 'S PROBLEM . IS TO MAKE US SOMEONE ELSE 'S PROBLEM . I 'LL THINK ABOUT IT . CAPTAIN . I SUGGEST YOU NOT TRY ANYTHING RASH . THE CAPTAIN OF THE LAST SHIP THOUGHT HE COULD STOP US . HE FAILED . HE DIDN 'T UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE MOMENT WE ARRIVE , WE HAVE THE UPPER HAND . I DON 'T KNOW . LOOKS MORE TO ME LIKE A MEXICAN STANDOFF . AFTER ALL , YOU 'RE STUCK ON THIS SHIP SAME AS WE ARE . ANYTHING YOU DO TO US ... YOU DO TO YOURSELVES . OH , NOT NECESSARILY , AS YOU 'LL DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF SOON ENOUGH IF YOU DON 'T GIVE US WHAT WE 'RE ASKING FOR . IF YOU DON 'T GIVE US WHAT WE 'RE ASKING FOR . DO YOU MIND ? SORRY . I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE STAYING IN YOUR QUARTERS . IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS ? I 'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING , GET INVOLVED , MAKE DECISIONS . LIGHTER OR DARKER HERE- - WHAT DO YOU THINK ? I THINK THAT YOU 'RE IN MY WAY . WHAT IS THIS , ANYWAY ? IT 'S A RECORD OF MY VISIT TO THE ALIEN SHIP . HMM . STRANGE , ISN 'T IT ? WHAT ? WELL , I 'M A DESIGNER . I THINK IN TERMS OF LINES , FORMS , DIRECTION . HOW THE IMAGE ADDS UP TO SOMETHING MORE . AND ? WELL , LOOK . ALL THOSE ALIENS TOUCHING EACH OTHER LIKE THAT . THEY WERE FIGHTING . NO , I 'VE SEEN FIGHTING , AND THAT 'S NOT IT . THEY FORM A CHAIN LEADING UP TO THAT TUBE , THE BACK ROW TOUCHING THE ONE IN FRONT OF IT , AND ON AND ON TO THE END . WE KNOW THE ALIEN FORCE WAS SPREAD BY TOUCH . YES ... BUT THE NUMBERS GET SMALLER THE CLOSER YOU MOVE TO THE TUBE , UNTIL THERE 'S JUST ... ONE . INTERESTING . DR. CHAMBERS SAW MULTIPLE E.E.G. READOUTS IN THE ALIEN WE BROUGHT BACK . SO THE PERSONALITIES ARE ALL IN ONE BODY AGAIN . SO THERE YOU ARE . IF TOUCH IS HOW THE GENIE GETS OUT OF THE BOTTLE , THEN MAYBE TOUCH IS HOW THE GENIE GETS BACK IN THE BOTTLE AGAIN . MAYBE . BUT WE STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE ALIEN FORMS OFF THE SHIP WILLINGLY . THAT 'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY . JUST SHOW THEM THIS COLOR SCHEME . IF THAT DOESN 'T DRIVE THEM OFF , NOTHING WILL . IF THAT DOESN 'T DRIVE THEM OFF , NOTHING WILL . LIEUTENANT . GIVEN WHAT I 'VE JUST HEARD , IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT OUR UNWELCOME GUESTS ARE GOING TO MAKE A MOVE SOMETIME SOON . WE 'VE SEALED OFF THE DECKS , BUT THERE 'S A LOT THEY CAN DO TO HURT US , EVEN FROM INSIDE . I HAD THE SAME THOUGHT . THIS DECK ALONE GIVES THEM ACCESS TO HELM AND STEERING CONTROLS . THEY COULD IMMOBILIZE US UNTIL WE AGREE TO TAKE THEM WHERE THEY WANT TO GO . EXACTLY . SO WE HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR ACCESS TO CRITICAL AREAS . NOW , LIFE SUPPORT FOR THESE DECKS ARE STILL CONTROLLED FROM HERE . IF WE CAN KILL THE HEATING SYSTEMS IN ALL THE AREAS WE NEED TO PROTECT , THEN WE CAN HERD THEM TOGETHER IN ONE CENTRAL AREA OVER HERE . IT 'LL TAKE A WHILE . WE 'LL HAVE TO OVERRIDE THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS . BUT ONCE WE CUT THE HEATING SYSTEM , IT 'LL GET REAL COLD THERE REAL FAST . THEN I SUGGEST YOU GET TO IT . AYE , SIR . AYE , SIR . SIR , MR. WELLES IS ON THE LINE . PUT HIM THROUGH . I TOLD YOU THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES IF YOU DID NOT COMPLY WITH OUR DEMANDS , CAPTAIN . YOUR ACTIONS WOULD INDICATE YOU DON 'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY . LET ME CHANGE THAT FOR YOU . LET ME CHANGE THAT FOR YOU . WAIT--WAIT ! WAIT ! NO ! [ PPG FIRES ] AAH ! YOU SON OF A BITCH , I SWEAR TO GOD I 'LL- - YOU 'LL WHAT ? KILL THIS BODY ? WE 'LL JUST MOVE INTO ANOTHER ONE . AS LONG AS ONE OF US GOES ON , WE ALL GO ON . OUR MISTAKE THE LAST TIME WAS ALLOWING THE CAPTAIN HIS FREEDOM FOR TOO LONG . WE DON 'T INTEND TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE . YOU HAVE EXACTLY 10 MINUTES IN WHICH TO SURRENDER YOURSELF TO US . IF YOU REFUSE , WE 'LL BEGIN KILLING ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE EVERY 5 MINUTES UNTIL YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND . DECIDE QUICKLY , CAPTAIN . YOU NOW HAVE 9 MINUTES . DECIDE QUICKLY , CAPTAIN . YOU NOW HAVE 9 MINUTES . TELL SECURITY TO UNLOCK THE BULLET CAR . I WANT TO GET IN THERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE . SIR , I OBJECT- - AND I OBJECT TO SITTING HERE LETTING MY PEOPLE GET MURDERED . SIR , ONCE YOU 'RE INSIDE , THEY CAN TAKE YOU OVER SAME AS THEY DID EVERYBODY ELSE . I MAY HAVE A WAY TO STALL , BUY US SOME TIME , BUT NOT A LOT . SO WE NEED TO FIGURE A WAY OUT OF THIS . WE 'LL HAVE TO PULL OUT PLAN B. WHAT 'S PLAN B ? WE CAN 'T AFFORD TO LET THESE THINGS GET TO AN INHABITED PLANET . IF WE CAN 'T STOP THEM ... IF IT LOOKS LIKE THEY 'RE GOING TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE SHIP , I 'M AUTHORIZING SELF-DESTRUCT . ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , THIS ENDS HERE . ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , THIS ENDS HERE . YES , SIR . YES , SIR . [ BEEP ] WELLES TO GIDEON- - YOU NOW HAVE 4 MINUTES LEFT . I KNOW . I KNOW . I KNOW . 30 SECONDS TO SPARE . I 'M A PUNCTUAL KIND OF GUY . I 'M A PUNCTUAL KIND OF GUY . DOES OUR PRESENCE OFFEND YOU ? YES . BUT THAT 'S NOT THE REASON . YOU DELIBERATELY PRECIPITATED THE CRISIS IN MEDBAY SO THAT SHE 'D HAVE TO ENTER WITHOUT A PROTECTIVE SUIT . SO WHATEVER YOU ARE , I FIGURE YOU CAN 'T GET THROUGH THIS ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN PASS THROUGH A CLOSED DOOR . Janey : VERY PERCEPTIVE , CAPTAIN . FLESH IS OUR CONDUIT , OUR BIOCHEMICAL DOOR INTO THE SOUL AND THE MIND . SO , IF YOU DON 'T MIND REMOVING THAT ... NOT A CHANCE . NOT AS LONG AS I HAVE THIS . IF YOU KILL US , THEN YOU KILL YOUR OWN CREW . WHICH RATHER DEFEATS THE POINT OF COMING . I DON 'T HAVE TO KILL YOU . ALL I HAVE TO DO IS BLOW AWAY THE KNEECAP OF ANYONE WHO TRIES IT . THEN WE CAN FIX THE DAMAGE LATER , AFTER YOU 'RE GONE . AND MEANWHILE , YOU 'RE , UH ... STUCK HERE WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN 'T USE IN A FIGHT . AS I SAID , PERCEPTIVE . BUT THERE IS ONE SMALL PROBLEM WITH YOUR LOGIC . IN LESS THAN AN HOUR , YOUR AIR SUPPLY WILL RUN OUT . THEN YOU 'LL HAVE TO TAKE OFF THAT SUIT ... OR DIE . EVEN YOU NEED AIR , CAPTAIN . THAT 'S TRUE . WE ALL DO , DON 'T WE ? WE ALL DO , DON 'T WE ? AS MR. EILERSON SAYS ... " THE AIR IS HUMAN . " " THE AIR IS HUMAN . " WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT ? THAT 'S A CLICHE . I NEVER USE CLICHES . I NEVER SAID THAT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE . IF I DIDN 'T FEEL FOR HIS POSITION , I 'D CONSIDER SUING . WAIT A MINUTE . THE SAYING IS , " TO ERR IS HUMAN , " NOT " THE AIR IS HUMAN . " DOES HE KNOW HE 'S BEING MONITORED ? AFFIRMATIVE . BUT THEY 'VE GOT THE FREQUENCY AS WELL , SO THEY 'RE PROBABLY LISTENING IN . THEN MAYBE THAT WAS MEANT FOR US . IF HE 'S FIGURED SOMETHING OUT AND HE COULDN 'T SAY IT OPENLY , HE 'D HAVE TO SAY IT IN A WAY THEY WOULDN 'T NOTICE . BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN ? " THE AIR IS HUMAN . " ON THE OTHER SHIP , THE BODIES WERE POINTED TOWARD THE CRYOTUBE , AS IF THEY WERE SENDING THE ALIEN FORCE BACK INTO ONE PERSON AS THE SHIP DEPRESSURIZED . WELL , IT 'S OBVIOUS THEY NEED AIR TO SURVIVE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE . IF THEIR HOST BODIES DIE OF OXYGEN DEPRIVATION , THEY DIE AS WELL . BUT HOW DOES THAT HELP US ? OH , HELL . I 'VE GOT IT . SARAH , HOW LONG DOES THE AVERAGE HUMAN LAST WITHOUT OXYGEN ? 4-5 MINUTES , NO MORE . THEN YOU START TO GET BRAIN DAMAGE . THAT 'LL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH . COME ON , WE GOTTA GET TO MEDBAY . WHAT 'S IN MEDBAY ? IF I 'M RIGHT , IT 'S OUR TICKET OUT OF HERE . IS THERE ANY WAY TO DEPRESSURIZE THE DECKS THAT THESE THINGS HAVE TAKEN OVER ? MR. EILERSON , THERE ARE E.V.A. SUITS ON THE MAIN DECK . IF EVEN ONE OF THEM GETS TO THEM , ALL WE 'LL HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING IS KILLING 200 PEOPLE . TRUST ME . TRUST ME . COMPUTER , HOW MUCH OXYGEN LEFT ? Computer , female voice : THERE ARE 24 MINUTES REMAINING OF E.V.A. OXYGEN . COME ON . COME ON , FIGURE IT OUT . COME ON , FIGURE IT OUT . Matheson , over P.A. : I REPEAT , STAND BY TO OVERRIDE SAFETY CONTROLS AND DEPRESSURIZE DECKS 7 THROUGH 9 . ALL MEDICAL PERSONNEL STAND BY . SECURITY DETAILS TO ALL AIR LOCKS . DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE PASSAGE WITHOUT CHALLENGE . PREPARE TO CRACK AIR LOCK ON DECK 9 . USE OF DEADLY FORCE IS AUTHORIZED . I REPEAT--USE OF DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED . I REPEAT--USE OF DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED . [ ALARM SOUNDS ] Computer : DECOMPRESSION ALERT . REPEAT- - DECOMPRESSION ALERT . NO . NOOOO ! [ EXPLOSION ] [ EXPLOSION ] [ AIR WHOOSHES ] [ AIR WHOOSHES ] Alien voice : I TOLD THEM THEY COULDN 'T STOP ME . [ LAUGHING ] I TOLD THEM . I TOLD THEM . HEY , SOMETHING 'S WRONG . I ... CAN 'T MOVE . I CAN 'T MOVE . I CAN 'T MOVE ! DON 'T ... WE CAN WORK THIS OUT . DON 'T DO THIS . WE CAN WORK TOGETHER . I KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR . [ VOICE ECHOING ] I KNOW WHERE YOU CAN FIND IT ! DON 'T DO THIS . DON 'T DO THIS ! Gideon : LIEUTENANT . YES , SIR ? YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO . AYE , SIR . AYE , SIR . FIRE . FIRE . [ ALIEN SCREECH ] Matheson , over P.A. : BEGINNING REPRESSURIZATION . MED TEAMS REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO DECKS 9 AND 10 . REPEAT--ALL MED TEAMS TO DECKS 9 AND 10 A.S.A.P. REPEAT--ALL MED TEAMS TO DECKS 9 AND 10 A.S.A.P. WE 'VE SECURED THE SHIP , CAPTAIN . Gideon : GOOD . NOW , BEFORE YOU LET ANYONE ELSE ON BOARD , BE SURE THE THING IS DECONTAMINATED FROM STEM TO STERN . I DON 'T WANT THIS HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN . ROGER THAT , CAPTAIN . WE 'LL CRACK THE DATABASE AND LET YOU KNOW IF WE FIND ANYTHING WE CAN USE . GOOD LUCK . MOVE US AWAY . Tech : YES , SIR . Tech : YES , SIR . CAPTAIN . MR. WELLES . FEELING BETTER ? STILL A LITTLE WEAK AROUND THE KNEES , BUT YES , THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR CREW . WE 'RE ABOUT TO HEAD OUT . IT 'S A BIT MORE EXCITEMENT THAN I 'M USED TO . BUT BEFORE THAT , I 'D LIKE TO THANK YOU PROPERLY . KEVIN ? WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHIPS , I FINISHED MY DESIGNS . WE HAD THEM STOP OFF EN ROUTE TO PICK UP THE NEW UNIFORMS SO YOU COULD HAVE THEM RIGHT AWAY . NEW UNIFORMS ? I DIDN 'T WANT TO WAIT A MINUTE LONGER THAN WAS NECESSARY . HUH . IT 'S GOT POWER , PRESENCE , STRENGTH . IT 'LL BLEND IN WITH THE SHIP SO YOU 'RE ALL MORE A PART OF IT . IT 'S OFFICIAL , DIGNIFIED . IT 'S EVERYTHING YOU COULD ASK FOR IN A UNIFORM .

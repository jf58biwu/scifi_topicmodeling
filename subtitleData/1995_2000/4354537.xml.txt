 [ Woman ] Two pair is the power . [ Man ] Ah , like candy from babies . Well , I 'm in for 50 . Zipper ? Oh , with a pair of ducks ? I 'm out . - How ' bout it , smokey ? - Very charming . Kiss your mother with that mouth ? Fold . Well , I guess it 's you and me , big time . I 'm gonna see the bet . I need kegger money . [ Laughing ] I 'll see your 50 ... and I 'll raise you 50 . - He 's got the flush , Lou . - Not a chance . Eleven spades played . That leaves two left in the deck . You only need one . All right . I will see your 50 and bump you 200 . Oh , looks like you 're a little light , mister . Well , I - I don 't have any more cash with me . I do have my watch . Will that work ? Let 's see . This is an Omega Seamaster . - Well , it 's gotta be worth at least four grand . - It 's worth six . And I 'll give it to you for the $ 327 bet ... and ... your hat . - You want my hat ? - Mm-hmm . All you have to do is call the bet . There 's a reason they call aces and eights a dead man 's hand , Wild Bill . Do you mind , smokey ? Excuse me . The watch is ticking . Last call for Hartford , Boston and Albany at Bay 7 . All aboard ! He 's got the flush , Lou . Just cut your losses . Let 's get on the bus . - Shut up . - Tick , tick , tick , tick . Tick , tick . - Fine . Take it . - Okay . - [ Sighs ] - Let 's go , Zipper . - [ Woman ] You boys stop by any time . - Hey , mister . - Did you have the flush ? - Do you really want to know ? - Nah . - Have a good trip . [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] Hell of a bluff , sweetie . Where did you learn to play cards ? I read this book . It 's very good . - [ Bell Dinging ] - Excuse me ? I need a ticket . Uh , your first thing out , please . I got a turnaround to Baltimore leaves in 10 minutes . Perfect . Thank you . You want to get on a bus , ride for an hour and come right back ? The bathroom . Do you have a bathroom ? It 's in the back . All right , Rachel . Time to come out of there . - I 'm not running away . - A bus station ? This looks very bad . I just need time to think . I don 't - I don 't - I don 't have any luggage . - You know what 's at stake here ? - Yes , I know . Why don 't you open the door , and we can settle this like decent human beings ? You got three seconds , bitch , or I take you where you sit . Hey ! I believe this is the ladies 'room . Ow . You can come out now . - Is he dead ? - I don 't think so . Oh , do you have any idea what you 've just done ? Helped you ? Mind your own business ! You could get somebody killed ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . " We are pleased to announce our engagement . Join us in celebrating our newfound bliss . " Oh , excuse me , but this is whacked with a capital " Y. " - Boys ? - It is the Centre . Strange bedfellows , for richer or poorer . Anything new from the bus station ? Uh , we 're still running the information . Jarod was all over those surveillance cameras , and he never got on a bus . Yeah . Right . Well , no , I have a team on top of it . Um , Miss Parker . I was wondering if maybe I can get out of here . I have a date tonight . - A date ? - Yeah . Charlene Reynolds . She works over in Accounting . She 's very nice , actually , except for the tooth . I also have plans . Another trip to the Chuckle Hut ? Mary Winfield . She 's giving a reading from her new book of poetry . - Sounds like a hoot . - What are you doing tonight , Miss Parker ? Good night . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - [ Machine Beeps ] - Hi , this is Rachel . The kids and I can 't come to the phone right now . Leave a message , and we 'll call you right back . Right , gang ? - [ Children ] Right ! - Tha-Tha-Tha-That 's all , folks ! [ Machine Beeps ] Are you stupid ? Did you forget what I told you ? Funny , it 's all coming back to me now . Turn around . Slowly ! What are you doing in my house ? - I got your address - - That hand disappears , so do you . My pocket . Where did you get this ? Off your friend at the bus station . - Did the company send you ? - The bus company ? You want to play games , I 'm gonna shoot you right here . In front of your children ? You have a beautiful family . Where are they ? - [ Cell Phone Rings ] - [ Gasps ] Yes ? I wasn 't running . I wouldn 't . You 're telling me he 's not one of yours ? No . No , I understand . I said I understand . Di - Please tell me what 's going on . Rock Creek Park , 10 : 00 a.m. Oh , yes , I will . I 'll be there . [ Sighs ] - [ Sighs ] What 's your name ? - Jarod . - Turn around , Jarod . - I 'd really rather not . Turn around . Have you ever felt completely alone ... like you 're in a dark room , and you can 't find the door ? My whole life . That 's what they 've done to me . They 've taken away the light . [ Grunts ] I 'm sorry . [ Sighs ] [ Whispering ] What am I gonna do ? What the hell - What do you two want ? Think of me as the United Nations ... holding peace talks to avoid a full-scale war . Don 't worry . I would never attack an unarmed person . [ Giggling ] You know better than that . Besides , I think baby sister and I can reach an accord on our own . Can 't we , love ? We can die tryin ' . Thought you quit . Actually , I was just about to clean out my desk ... which is what I 'd like to get back to , if you two don 't mind . You really should get a personal life . Your father and I have a very special relationship . Someday I hope you find the happiness that we share . How could you let this happen ? Hey , it 's just as strange for me as it is for you ... that our father 's marrying Brigitte . Hell , I slept with her myself . Look , just because you haven 't found happiness ... that doesn 't mean you should deny it to those around you . Hmm ? [ Groans ] [ Sighs ] Damn . [ Man ] Hot dogs and pretzels here . Get your hot dogs and pretzels . [ Carousel ] [ Bell Rings ] That bruise looks painful . Where 's your hero ? What do you want ? Take the case under the bench . - What 's in it ? - Shut up . There 's a room waiting for you at the Chester Hotel . The reservation 's under the name Andrews . Take the case and wait there . I 've done everything you 've asked . Can I at least just see them ? If it were my call , I 'd shoot you in the head right here . I 'll stay in touch . Will she or won 't she ? Only her cardiologist knows for sure . You should probably stock up on red meat and doughnuts while you 're at it . I mean , why waste a perfectly good heart attack ? - Have we met ? - Thomas Gates . Friends call me Tommy . So , what do your friends call you ? - I don 't have any friends . - Oh . Two years , three months , 21 days . - What ? - That 's how long it 's been since I 've had a cigarette . - How ' bout you ? - I stopped counting . Damn it . - Do you believe in fate ? - Oh , please . Come on . A sensible ex-smoker risks her hard-earned two and a quarter to rejoin the nicotine club . A vending machine malfunctions , giving a stranger ... in - in jeans and Pendleton ... time to convince her that she doesn 't really want to belong to that club . Fate . - [ Door Hinges Squeaking ] - [ Bells Jingling ] [ Door Closes ] [ Gasps ] Now , why would someone run away from the people they loved ? Who are you ? Someone who 's trying to help you find your light again . And what were you planning to do with this ? Get my children back . It was called the M2 Project . I was 22 when they recruited me from the University of Virginia . - " They " ? Meaning the company ? - The company . Why was the C.I.A. Interested in college students ? We were computer analysts , tops of the class . They took us and trained us in the creation of covert simulations . - Simulations ? - Hypothetical scenarios . Kidnapping , sabotage , assassination . They told us that the files were being created for training situations . How many people were involved in this M2 ? Five , including me . We all had military background . I was R.O. T.C. So , you can obviously handle a firearm . My father was a champion target shooter . I was a better shot than him . [ Sighs ] I started reading stories in the newspaper ... of bombings , terrorist assaults , political murders ... and I recognized them from the files that we thought up . You have no idea what that 's like , to know people are dying from something you thought up . To have so much innocent blood on your hands . I understand . I begged for a transfer ... and Renfro looked at me like I 'd asked him to give up a kidney . - Renfro ? - Alex E. The man in charge of M2 . So , what happened ? I started to ingest small amounts of poison . Commercial pesticides . After a month of throwing up on my desk ... Renfro actually signed the transfer papers himself . - Where 's your husband ? - He walked out on us after Zach was born . So , after 10 years with no contact with anyone at M2 ... out of nowhere , they take your children ? It was 10 days ago . I was finishing the dishes . Melinda and Zachary were at the table drawing pictures . - [ Knocking ] - I heard a knock at the front door . Not unusual . We get salespeople in our area all the time . - [ Barking ] - Then Maggie , our dog , started barking in the backyard . - [ Knocking Continues ] - When I heard the knocking again , I - I asked the kids to check on her , and I went to answer the door . When I opened it and there was no one there , my heart stopped instantly . I knew there was something wrong . I went running to the back of the house , and the kids were gone . Zachary ! Melinda ! [ Sighs ] I got a call a few minutes later . I didn 't recognize the voice , but ... the message was certainly clear - I do exactly what they say , or they kill my children . I don 't know who they want me to shoot ! They 'll tell you when they 're ready . - [ Bell Dinging ] - [ Horn Honks ] I think the guy 's in the bathroom . Too much applejack . - Here , let me get that for you . - I can do it myself . Thank you . So , you live up on Bryer , don 't you ? Careful . They have stalking laws in this state . I 'm restoring the split-level just north of you . That dump on the hill ? There 's nothing quite like discovering a 17 th-century hardwood floor ... under a sheet oflime green linoleum . I can only imagine . Don 't you have any passions , Miss Parker ? - You know my name . - People talk . " Gates ' Restoration . 'Where everything old is new again . " ' I wrote that myself . Move over , Hemingway . Well ... you have yourself a nice day , Miss Parker . I have a feeling you deserve one . So , the camel says , " Hump her ? I don 't even know her ! " Hump her . - It 's a - It 's a good joke . - Broots , I need your help . - That joke always kills . - Focus , Shecky . - Okay . - Thomas Michael Gates . - Yeah ? - I want you to run him through the system - personal history , family background , the whole nine yards . And I want this information delivered to my office A.S.A.P. All right . Who is he ? The quicker , the better . Miss Parker , did you hear the one about the coyote ... the , uh - the jackal and the one-eyed armadillo ? [ Nervous Chuckle ] Oh , well . Rachel ? I downloaded this picture from the federal archives . - Do you recognize anyone ? - That 's Alex Renfro . - Hmm . - What ? I ran a background check on him . He 's suspected in at least a half a dozen political assassinations ... and the F.B.I. Had him on their internal top-10 list . Why " had " ? Alex Renfro died in a bus crash in Honduras in 1995 . I also ran a background check on all the other M2 members . Each one of them is dead , along with their families . - Each death ruled accidental . - Oh , my God . Each M2 death ... was preceded within 48 hours by a political assassination . They 're doing the same thing to me . After you do this job ... they 're going to kill you and your family . [ Jarod ] All right . Let 's go over this one more time . We know that Renfro and the other members of the M2 unit are dead . But was there anyone else that you can think of that somehow might have been involved ? Nobody . Think hard . Don 't you think I have ? Do you have any idea what a nightmare my life has become ? Ten days ago I was planning P.T.A. Meetings and making cookies for a bake sale ! Now I 'm sitting here waiting for someone to tell me who I 'm supposed to kill ! I 'm sorry . Maybe we should take a little break . - Who are you ? - What do you mean ? You-You rescue me in a bathroom like some phantom out of the night . You access classified files like it 's nothing . And you seem to feel what I feel before I feel it . - Who are you ? - I 'm just a guy waitin ' for a bus . [ Knocking ] [ Knocking Continues ] I 'm standin ' out here like an idiot pizza boy . I was in the bathroom . I 'm sorry . You 've made the place very homey . Not much of a view . - I hadn 't noticed . - Ooh , relax . You look guilty , and you haven 't even killed anybody yet . What 's this ? Open it . - Where are you going ? - The bathroom . Do you mind ? Senator Sanford Ryst . He 's givin 'a speech at Slayton Hall tonight . He 's arriving there for a rehearsal in exactly one hour . [ Toilet Flushes ] What am I supposed to do ? We 've arranged access through a side service door . As Reest finishes the rehearsal , you will shoot him once through the forehead . Nice towels . Why ? Don 't mess up ... Mom . Thanks . I 'll see you tomorrow . We 're gonna have to stop meeting ' like this . People will talk . Well , people talk . I don 't usually pay much attention to them myself . That 's good advice . So , it looks like we 're gonna have a full moon tonight . I hear that happens almost monthly . Right . Right . Look , I know this is a little abrupt , but , uh ... I was gonna take a drive out to the bluffs and try out my new telescope . Would you like to join me ? Was that the worst pick-up line in the history of pick-up lines ? So , you-you want to come ? Do I look like a " hangin ' out in the woods " kind of gal to you ? Well , uh , not in those shoes , no ... but , uh , you never can tell ... when people are ready to dive into a new experience . Know what I mean ? Sorry to disturb you , Miss Parker , but there 's been a bit of an emergency . - What kind of an emergency ? - The personal kind . I 'll see you back at the office . Roommate ? I have to go . I 'm sorry , but this was a big mistake . Look , I 'll be up by Old Bridge Road if you change your mind . I won 't . - [ Engine Starts ] - Gotta kick off those shoes one day , Parker . [ Jarod ] I would suggest a second and third scenario . Automatic weapon fire from behind the building over here , and a staged auto accident here . That would leave the transport - You 'll never guess who I just ran into . - [ Monitor . Jarod Continues ] - What are you doing ? Who do you work for ? - The C.I. A ? The N.S. A ? Who ? - This isn 't what it looks like . Good . ' Cause it looks like you 've been involved in some pretty ugly stuff . - Rachel , I can explain - - I trusted you ! I trusted you with the lives of my children ! Alex Renfro is alive . I just saw him outside of this hotel . My guess is he 's behind everything that is happening to you . - Get in the closet . - You know what he 's going to do to you after this is over ! - I 'm gonna talk to him . Get in . - I can help you . I 'm gonna talk to him ! Get in ! Don 't make me choose between you and my children ! You 're making a mistake . My mistake . Rachel , listen to me ! [ Grunts ] Damn it . - What do you think you were doing out there ? - My job . - By spying on me ? - By following orders . Oh . I have to admit - [ Giggles ] Thomas is cute . If you like that blue-collar ... dirt-under-the-fingernails , butt-crack refrigerator repairman type . Why ... are you still involved in my life ? [ Sighs ] Your father and I love you very much . - We only want what 's best for you . - Daddy ordered these ? You don 't know a thing about this man . He could be a security risk ... not to mention a sexual deviant . He 's a carpenter . So he says . Now , the point is , you are not to have further contact with him ... until a complete background check is finished . Mmm . Was that an order ? From the highest level . Don 't fool yourself into thinking you 're like them , because you 're not . Never forget where you 've come from , Miss Parker . Ever . Okay . Excuse me . What the hell you doin ' here ? Is there anything above the control booth ? I 'm with security . Uh , nothin ' but the catwalk . - How do I get up there ? - That way . Joe , bring the houselights down to a quarter . God , please forgive me . Rachel , don 't do this . [ Gasps ] Stop . Stop ! You asked me once if I knew what it felt like to have innocent blood on my hands . I do . I try to run from it . I spend every day of my life trying to make up for it . - I 'm afraid . - I know you are . But if you pull that trigger , if you kill this man ... there 'll be no life left for you or your children . I don 't want to kill anybody . I have to . If there is a way to save your children ... I 'll find it or I 'll die trying . I promise you that . Please ? Put down the rifle . [ Sobs ] [ Exhales , Inhales Sharply ] You just saved his life . I just killed my children . [ Agent On Radio ] All units , Eagle 2 is on the go . [ Agent # 2 On Radio ] This is Columbia 5 . Copy that . Standing by . [ Agent # 1 On Radio ] Secure parking lot . - Where are we going ? - I don 't know yet . - What do you mean , you don 't know ? - [ Cell Phone Rings ] Hello ? I am disappointed in you , Rachel . - Renfro . - Still quite the little problem solver , aren 't you ? Except you 've created a sizable dilemma for your children . - Why didn 't you just do what you were told ? - Please don 't hurt them . That 's out of my control now . I 'll do anything ! L-l-I 'll do anything ! Listen to me , Renfro . There 's a new player at the table . The white knight from the bus station . I know you were behind the M2 killings . I know you faked your own death to avert an F.B.I. Manhunt . Is this the best hand you have ? I have a videotape of you taken this afternoon outside the Chester Hotel . I have Rachel , your last witness . So , unless you return the children , unharmed ... I am going to place a phone call to the F.B.I. And tell them you are very much alive . There won 't be a hole on this planet deep enough for you to crawl into . - You have 30 seconds to make up your mind . - [ Beeps ] [ Gasps ] What are you doing ? Are you insane ? - He 'll call back . - What if he doesn 't call back ? These are my children ! Come on . You have more innocent blood on your hands . [ Rings ] - [ Exhales ] - [ Rings , Beeps ] Speak to me . What 's the play ? With this guy , cautious . We meet Rachel , the white knight , exchange the kids for the tapes . Then we follow them home , and you kill them . - [ Carousel ] - [ Chattering , Screaming ] Rachel . It 's been a long time . You look good . Where are my children ? Close . Very close . The tape we talked about . Now , where are the children ? What 's to keep you from going to the authorities after I turn them over ? I don 't care what happens to you , Renfro . I want my family . I believe you . - Oh ! - Mommy ! Mommy ! Oh , come here ! - I love you ! - [ Rachel ] Oh , my God ! Our business appears to be done . Be sure to check the tape . I wouldn 't want you to feel cheated . [ Engine Starts ] I won 't forget this . [ Door Closes ] How are you , baby ? [ Laughing ] [ Car Pulling Away ] Before we get on with the rest of our show ... I wanted to congratulate you on your masterful hand of poker - your use of low-profile assassins , your own fake death ... to sever any connection to the killings ... and your elimination of all witnesses and their immediate families . Now , I realize that there was no way that you were going to allow Rachel and her children ... to just walk away ... even after you got what you wanted . Like I said before - [ Cards Turning Over ] There 's a new player at the table ... and I 'm afraid you 're not going to like the hand you were just dealt . Go ahead . Open the envelope . [ Sighs ] Aces and eights . Dead man 's hand . Which is exactly what you are . [ Siren Wailing ] Oh , God . [ Police Radio Chatter , Indistinct ] - Get out of the car ! - Let me see your hands ! - Get ' em up ! - Hands in the air , now ! Get your hands up and put ' em on the roof of the car ! [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] - What ? - [ Jarod ] It 's midnight , Miss Parker . - What a shock to find you still at the office . - I was just on my way out . I met a woman who reminds me of you . - [ Continues ] - She was smart , compassionate ... and tortured . Is that what I am ? Like you , she was a prisoner of her past ... of people who wanted to control her future . Instead of fighting back , she almost let them destroy her . Doesn 't sound like a happy ending . Oh , it all worked out in the end . I hope the same thing happens for you . - Meaning ? - Trust your heart , Miss Parker . Don 't let them take away your happiness . - [ Continues ] - [ Beeps ] I didn 't think you 'd come . Tell me about yourself . What do you want to know ? Everything .

 What magnificent abundance . I imagine the Garden of Eden must have been like this . Without the dinosaurs and the ape-men . Oh yes my dear but every garden has its serpent . Time to go home come on , Professor . My goodness , could that be an airplane ? Get away from the flower Now ! Good god ! Are you alright ? I don 't know . Come on . Oh my leg It 's not that bad . No . No stay down . I 'm making a tourniquet . But Veronica I 'm not bleeding that badly . It 's the bee venom it 's deadly . At the dawn of the century A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and the Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World So you 're standing in front of an elephantine flower ... and you hear a buzzing sound . I thought it was an airplane . You 're a botanist for God sakes . Anyone could have made the same mistake . An Imbecile , now look what you 've gone and done to yourself . That 's enough , let him rest . No he 's right . So it 's always fatal ? I 've never heard of anyone surviving . How long ? Two maybe three days . So we 've got forty eight hours to find an antidote . What do you suggest ? I just told you there 's nothing ... There must be something , somebody . Well think child you 've lived here all your life . Go easy she said she didn 't know . Unacceptable . It 's not her fault . She was with him . Wait ! There is someone ... a healer . I think her name was Adama . Where ? I haven 't been there since I was a child . I don 't know if I can find her . We 'll find her . The sooner we get going the better . - I 'm coming with you . - Okay someone should stay with the Professor . Florence Nightingale reporting for duty . Hmm must be those strong maternal instincts . I 'll stay too . I saw tracks this morning . Ape-men They 're getting brave again . We 'll be quick . Let 's go we don 't want to be stumbling through the jungle in the dark . Feels like we 've been walking for hours . Which way ? I don 't know . It 's been eighteen years she may not even be alive anymore . No time for second thoughts Summerlee 's counting on us . Come on , think . Is there a landmark anything you can remember ? You can do this Veronica . I don 't know it all looks so different . You got us this far . Take a deep breath and relax . Good . Now use your instincts . Forget what you see what do you feel ? That way . You know Arthur , it really is extraordinary the lengths to which you will go just to get attention . Hope I 'm not disturbing you two . Here , I 'm not very good at this sort of thing . Modesty , from the great George Challenger . What a surprise , I thought you were good at everything . You know where I come from women are not so bold . Oh , how dull for you . Any of this look familiar yet ? I think so ; I think we 're close . There it is . I knew you could do it . Adama ? Adama ? Adama ? She still lives here . Well someone definitely lives here . What the hell is this place ? Roxton ! Ahem I must have dosed off for a moment . How is he ? Judging from his color his iver 's beginning to fail . His fever 's worse . There were some Boletus Mushrooms growing down by the pond . If we boil them they may bring his fever down . He needs more than that . Where are they ? I should have gone with them . And done what ? It would have been better than the nothing we 're doing here . We 're not doing nothing ; we 're making him comfortable . At least he 'll be among friends when he dies . He is not going to die . Here drink this you 'll feel better . Forgive my welcome but as I grow older I find myself less trusting of strangers . Yes don 't we all . As for your friend there 's nothing I can do . There 's no antidote ? None that you could find . But it exists ? Queen 's Bee Royal Jelly it is in the center of the hive . Then that 's where we 'll go . Don 't be a fool . Nothing human survives in the hive and even if you get in . What ? Twenty years ago a man stole honey from the hive . Oh He escaped with his life but he brought destruction of upon us all . How ? The bee 's tracked his scent back to our village . They attacked , killed everyone except me and Ilura my daughter . My people had managed to kill one of them So I cut it open the two of us hid ourselves inside its body ... until the screaming stopped . It wasn 't long enough . This bee thought Ilura was an injured drone and it carried her off . I never saw her again . It was along time ago . If you journey to the hive it will not save your friends life you will only lose your own . It just might work Ape-men Thanks Is that all of them ? And the one I left on the trail . Why were you expecting more ? - No - Don 't lie Challenger you don 't do it well . I saw tracks this morning just outside the camp . - How many ? - Eight maybe ten . That 's why you stayed behind . - Where are you going ? - To pack I 'm going to the Zanga village until the others get back Summerlee won 't make it . The ape-men will kill us all if we stay . Summerlee has spent half his adult life attacking you . I don 't understand why you 're risking your neck for him now . No I don 't suppose you would . Don 't try and make your guilt mine . Summerlee isn 't here because I goaded him into it We are all adults . We all made choices ; each of us are here for our own reasons . Now it 's time to get back to work . I may have a way for us to survive you may go or you may stay your choice . I 've been working on this for some time behold the electric coil . At least the condemned will eat a hearty meal . Just what is that supposed to be ? It 's an essential element in the production of electricity . How is that going to protect us from the ape-men ? Oh I assure you , they will find it very shocking . You will stay ? Whatever it is it has better work . That woman . Adama ? Don 't get me wrong she had a lovely collection of eyes . Is it just me or is she a little ... different . Depends on where you come from . This is New York she 'd either be in a side show or an asylum . We 're not in New York we 're in her world . As far as she 's concerned we 're the crazy ones for trying to get into the hive . Maybe she 's right . You can go back anytime . Summerlee means as much to me as he does to you Roxton . It 's okay Malone you 'd be crazy not to be scared . It 's just with bees the size of iceboxes the learning curves a little steep . Run fast stay alive . Now according to her directions , we should be getting close . Shhh ... listen ... the hive is just over that hill . Come on then . I can hear it but I can 't see it . So you think the hive is in that mountain ? I 've got news for you Malone , that mountain is the hive . We can 't chance firing our weapons . - Why not ? - A gunshot this close to the hive ... they 'll swarm . We 'd have a thousand bees on our tail . How are we going to get inside if we can 't shoot our way in ? We won 't survive . No human would . Exactly my point . And mine . Is any of this making sense to you ? I think so . Adama survived the attack . Because the bee thought she was one of them . All we need is a dead bee . We can 't shoot one we going to wait ' til one dies of old age ? No . You are kidding . I did it once . I can do it again . I don 't seem to have my usual appetite . Water ? Oh I 'm fine thank you very much . If you need anything else I 'll be in the next room . If you don 't mind you 've been so kind already . What is it ? Stay just a few more moments . Sure I won 't disturb you ? No not at all . You could sit over there and read or ... I 'm being very foolish . You 're going to be alright you know . I 'm going to tell you a secret , my dear ... I 'm afraid to die alone . Don 't talk nonsense . Years ago my wife contracted typhoid fever ... doctors did all they could ... came down to a matter of days hours , minutes ... and at the last I was a coward . Professor you don 't have to . Anna was her name . She wasn 't even lucid at the end . Certainly not the beautiful , laughing girl I married . More like a raving fevered animal . I couldn 't stay , I couldn 't watch . Kept telling myself it wasn 't her . I 'm so sorry Arthur . It must have been horrible for Anna to go along without anyone there to hold her hand . Black tar next best thing to oil . Marguerite ? What are you doing here ? I heard the shot I thought maybe you were in trouble . You 've left Summerlee unprotected . Next time I 'll let him eat you . Piece of cake what 's next ? It 's time to become the bee . You can 't be serious . The body 's gone . Ape-men eat their dead . Charming . How 's the Professor ? Sleeping finally . I 'm almost there . If you say so . The physics may be too complex for you . Humor me , oh great one . Sufficed to say ... it involves magnetic fields and this ... meteorite that was good enough to join us from outer space . So what are we waiting for ? - You - Me ? In order for the device to work I require a quantity of ... non-conducting fabric . Silk is most desirable . In other words madam , I 'm asking you to surrender your undergarments . In the name of science ... of course What ? Such a tableau of domestic tranquility . Isn 't it though ? Ape-men poised to attack ... me cutting up my own underwear ... Summerlee dying in the next room oh real cozy . To the London Zoological Society . I Arthur Edward Summerlee ... Oh god you do go on don 't you . I hear by attest to the full truthfulness and accuracy of Professor Challenger 's claim ... regarding the Lost World as my final act before death . Before Death ? Unacceptable , you are not allowed to die . Do you hear me ? I am the leader of this expedition and I do not give you permission to die . Quiet you 'll wake him up Do you know what this fool has done ? You can tell me outside . Anna It 's me Marguerite . Anna I 'm so sorry . What 's he talking about ? Hush now lie back down . I wanted to stay . He 's delusional poor chat . Anna ... I 'm sorry . Everything 's alright Arthur . Anna 's here , lie back down now take my hand . There see what a good husband you are . Stay right here by my side . Never leave me never . Anna Asleep again . Each bee is checked by a sentry we 'll have to pass the same inspection . Let 's hope they don 't have a secret handshake . I 'll go first ... if something goes wrong , run like hell . What about you ? I 'll be dead . Here goes nothing . I guess we won 't be needing this . Keep it you never know . Hard as a rock . But it 's wax . Look at the size of this place . It 's the giant maze we 're never going to find the queen 's chamber . Then Summerlee 's dead . Ennie meenie minie . Moe it is . This way . How do you know ? Instinct Weapons ready . Honey Come on keep up . Would you look at this place there must be hundreds of them . Try thousands Hatching areas for eggs . Good that means we 're close to the queen . - Worker bee . - In there . Veronica ... are you alright ? I 've been better . Oh boy . Take my arm . There 's something in here with me . Come a little closer . Stop kicking your legs so we can grab you . I don 't know what it is . I 'm going in grab my ankles . What was that ? Trouble But it sounded almost human . Nothing human sounds like that . Hold on Roxton you were right . Come on . You okay ? I am now ... we just found the queen 's chamber . Where ? That 's a long way down . There are footholds in the honeycombs we can climb down . Didn 't come all this way for nothing . Let 's do it . All done . As am I. I hope you know what you 're doing . Really Miss . Krux your lack of faith is becoming disturbing . Let 's just say I don 't take anything for granted rules are different out here . The fundamental principles of science are not . Now 's your chance to prove me wrong . Any time now . Somedays I hate being right . Saving your arrogant ass . I bought you an hour . Did you hear that ? Hear what ? Just bees , come on . I guess your right . I could have sworn I heard footsteps though . Footsteps ? That 's impossible . This whole place is impossible Malone . There look . Footprints Small barefoot . Definitely human . The scream . What the hell have we gotten ourselves into ? There it 's ready . More ready than last time ? Mans greatest gift is the power of his intellect . Oh do shut up . cut up my silk underwear for this I gotta hand it to you , you really are a genius . Let me guess . The queen . Whoa look at the size of her . She must be centuries old . Royal jelly . Let 's get it and get out here . That does not belong to you . We only need a little to save a friends life . We mean you no harm . You have killed one of my brothers murdered one of the babies . You have already caused us harm . These are not your brothers . You 're human like us . I am nothing like you . The punishment for murder is death . Oh my god you are Ilura . What did you say ? Ilura don 't you understand ? It 's your mother who sent us here Adama . This is my mother the only mother I 've ever known . That 's not true . If you remember your name you must remember your mother . Her voice singing you to sleep her arms holding you up to the sunlight . That 's right , remember your village ? The attack before the hive . Before the hive there was nothing . I was nothing . Now I am at one with them . I feel the wind caressing each wing ... share the joy of drinking from the blossom . I am more than their queen I am their heart ... the soul itself of the hive . The memories you offer ... they have nothing to give me . That 's too bad ... we 'll have to do this the hard way . Let 's go ! I don 't know if you can hear me Arthur . But it really is pathetic the lengths to which you will go ... just to get some attention . Not often I get the last word . I know we 've not always seen eye to eye professionally speaking that is . But personally and I never told you this because I knew ... you would use it against me . In some ways I envy you . Not your myopic scientific view of the natural world ... but certain qualities ... Your sense of humor , your humanity ... and your children . Peace there friend ... peace . I think he heard you . I didn 't mean to eavesdrop . Little matter now . Early warning system ? One way to find out . Persistent little buggers , aren 't they ? No second chances this time around . It 'll work . I 'd stake my life on it . You already did . I think they 're beginning to get the message . I 'll take the first watch just in case . You 'll look after Summerlee and ... Challenger . Well done . Yes . If only I could heal as effectively as I managed to kill . Don 't move . And I thought bees didn 't see well . Ilura does . We 're trapped . We 'll make our stand here . How the hell do we do that ? A life for a life . Stay back . Over there come on . Ilura come with us the hive is dying . Come with us ! Come home ! I am home . Ilura ! She 's gone we have to go . We failed . We survived . The hive is gone and the royal jelly with it . What are we going to tell Professor Summerlee ? How about ... get well soon . This tea is delicious . What 's in it ? Trust me , not a question you want to ask . Orange blossom , jasmine an eel or two . I don 't care what you put in it . I 'm not the man to refuse one of your potions after all without your antidote I 'd be nothing more than ... a hopefully fond memory . It was the royal jelly that cured you ... you 've your friends to thank for that . Nevertheless there is something I 'd like to give you a small token . It 's what 's left of the royal jelly . Maybe it will help save another life . One day perhaps the bees will return . I hope not . Do you know for the first time since Ilura was taken . I 've managed to sleep without the nightmares . Tell me ... when you were there in the hive did you see ... I mean was there anything ... any sign that Ilura might of survived ? We ... I 'm sorry Adama ... but your daughter nothing human survives the hive .

 What is this ? Hey ! What 's going on ? All the satellite signals are gone ! Get someone here , quick ! Lam , call Engineering and have them check the backups . Sorry to call you back on your wedding day . What is it ? The end of the world ? Some big shit like that ! What is it then ? All the satellite signals were disconnected . Only the underwater cables are still functioning . Stanley station is still checking the backups . Hong Kong # 1 is down , we couldn 't get signals from # 2 and # 4 , and # 6 is toasted . What should we do ? Call the Doctor . We still haven 't found him . Oh ! He 's over there ! Hello ? Dr. Ken ! What is it ? I 've been trying to call you . Something major is going down at Stanley ! Mr. Ken , Mr. John is already here . The satellite signal was completely down for 30 minutes . It 's back to normal now , but all the backups are gone . Initial investigation shows no signs of sabotage . As for the breakdown , we simply couldn 't determine the cause . You 'll have to figure that out . Thank you so much . Let 's go . That 's it ! What did the Observatory say ? The sunspots showed no irregular activities in the past 24 hours , and there 're no record of planetary explosions . Even Guangzhou and Shenzhen reported nothing special . In other words , it only happened in Hong Kong . Look , even the server is toasted . We should 've easily detected such high levels of energy . Yes , I understand . I understand perfectly , but ... But you know we can 't operate without a backup system ! We 'll create our own if we have to ! Right ... Call the insurance company right away . Well ? Is Clarence still upset ? You would be too if it were you . But I don 't think anyone needs to be responsible . The antenna was wrecked by Him . Looks like the insurance company will suffer the most . They 'll lose their pants ! Mr. Ken said it 'd be a few more minutes . Did you tell him this is regarding his own life ? I did , but he 's dealing with something even more important . More important than his own life ? That 's what he said ! Wait . Excuse me ! - Why are you here ? - Why are you here ? My buddy called me here ! Chiu Tai-pang , from Sun Leung Tam , CID . Nice to meet you . Detective Chiu , you 're here ! Boss said to see him the moment you 're here . Detective Chiu ! It 's okay . I know them . What shit are you in now , classmate ? So many cops here to see you . - Mr. Chan . - Inspector Yip , James from the UK . - Hello ! - How do you do ? Take a seat . What can I do for you ? In the past 3 months , 3 scientists had died mysteriously . They all had one thing in common . They were voted " Top Ten Future Leaders " by Century Magazine . Mr. Ken , were you on that list as well ? We have reasons to believe that your life is in danger . So this flimsy piece of paper is the " Top Ten Future Leaders " certificate ? So this flimsy piece of paper is the " Top Ten Future Leaders " certificate ? Yup ! Any prize money ? Nope . Let me explain this to you , Big Eyes . Do you know each year the U.N. chooses only 10 people as mankind 's future leaders ? I was one of them , AND also the first Chinese ever selected . What 's so smart about you then ? I 'll make it simple for you . Before , it took this size of cable to transmit data . Now , this will do the trick . - Is that it ? - That 's it ! Then I have something here that 'd make you even happier ! What is it ? Congratulations , Mr. Ken , you 've been awarded ... " Best Boyfriend Of The Year " ! Aren 't you a happier man now ? Are you proud ? Any prize money ? No . Prizes ? Nope . No way ! I 've got to have something ! Mr. Ken . Mr. Ken ? Have you ever heard of a group called " Brotherhood Of Technology " ? Uh ... no . Never mind . Really , I 've never heard of them , and I 've never received anything from this group . Hold it . Are you taking his statements ? What 's the charge ? You don 't have to answer them . You 're a cop too . Don 't interfere with our work . I 'm off duty now , and I 'm speaking as his friend . We do not suspect Mr. Ken . We 're just concerned about his safety . Do you know Liam Anderson ? I do . He died last night . Why wasn 't this announced ? We have to keep it confidential because his death was very peculiar . Mr. Ken , let me ask you once again . Where were you at around 10 : 30 last night ? That was when our satellite signal went down ! The antenna was burnt at around that time . By the way , Madam , why was Mr. Anderson in Hong Kong ? We 're not too sure either . He was reported missing in Edinburgh , and was selected as Chairman of Global Bank just last month . Ml6 has always thought he was kidnapped by terrorists . Was he rich ? Not really , but he 's influential enough to control half of Europe 's cash flow . Wow , that was one hell of an explosion ! Really ? Hey , Detective Chiu ! Are you transferred back to the city ? Did you get promoted ? Promoted ? You 've got to be kidding . I wish . My superiors asked me to forward these to some big shot . Turns out that big shot is you ! I mean , I have a higher ranking , a better paycheck , and a bigger condo . But you 're the man ! Hey , Detective , is it an in-thing now just to wear the gun case ? Is the info here ? Who are you ? These are confidential ! Ah ... Dr. Ken ! He is Dr. Ken Tit-sun . Dr. Ken ? Don 't you specialize in information transmission technology ? I don 't suppose you 're an expert in forensics ? I 'm just doing research . Please ... Thanks . Obviously , there was an explosion at the scene . According to witnesses ' statements , they think that the explosives were already attached to the victim 's body . Was anybody else there at the time ? Did anyone else get hurt ? Well ... one was over here , the other one was over there . But they 're both lucky . They only received slight burns on the skin . According to the record , Mr. Anderson weighed about 175 pounds , but his identifiable remains totaled less than 10 pounds . That includes a portion of the liver , one section of the spine , one complete left foot , and a shoe and sock that were hardly torched . There 's also his skull , but it 's completely deformed . A deformed skull ? Sure ! The skull is the hardest part of the body . It 's more difficult to alter it . You need at least 3000 degrees Celsius to perform cremation . The explosion only lasted half a second . It must 've been really powerful ! Have you performed an autopsy on his spine , liver and skull ? Yes . It 's all in here . Does the report state that the inside was burnt , but the outside was normal ? Bingo ! Perfect ! Were there any traces of explosives ? Well , that 's the oddest thing . A Ml6 member claimed that he saw the victim 's bible catching fire first . But all was not burnt . The last chapter remains . As for traces of explosives , we couldn 't find any near the crime scene . Did you notice the sticky grease stain ? We 're running it through the lab . We think it 's only burnt lard . Do you think it 's human ? Are you serious ? You mean this ? I believe it 's spontaneous combustion . The U.S. has recorded cases of spontaneous combustion as early as 1952 . The evidence was very similar to the ones at the tower . But how can someone just explode ? The human body consists mostly of water . Water is H2O . Both hydrogen and oxygen are the most inflammable substances . Why can 't there be an explosion ? What caused the explosion then ? Even though there had been a few instances , no reasonable explanation can be found . Did Mr. Anderson die of natural causes ? I don 't know . But , if someone can somehow cause another human to combust , and if that person wants to kill me , I don 't think anyone can protect me . I do not wish to be followed by strangers . Furthermore , I don 't believe someone 's trying to kill me . The police are just concerned about your safety , Mr. Ken . I know . I think you just want a cop to protect me , to show your boss that you 've done your jobs . Tai-pang will do ! This time I must agree with him . This shit is huge , and you want me to protect you ? You 're playing with your life ! You better ask for a Ml6 . No , really . Detective Chiu ! Sorry , Mr. Ken . This gentleman claimed to be from Tak Ying Sauna . He said he must say something very important to Detective Chiu in person . Hey ! How 's the assignment coming along ? Detective Chiu ! I 've told you to wait outside for me , man ! I better give this to you personally , sir . I did great this time , didn 't I ? Not bad , huh ? Janis , show this gentleman out . Sir , this way . Hey , didn 't you say you 've got some ... V stuff , some real powerful shit ? - Can I see it ? - Sure ! Ask Teresa to show you around . Your company has quite a setup ! Lots of staff ! Were you Mr. Ken 's classmate back in Cambridge ? Which field were you in ? It 's true that we 're old classmates ... back in elementary school . But it 's quite a famous school . It 's all my old man 's fault . I couldn 't get in high school because he didn 't get the janitor job . Wow ! This HDTV tank looks real ! Such high resolution ! Do you need to feed them with electric worms ? You can still laugh even though it 's not funny . Any progress from the police investigation ? We believe that the murders are all related to Brotherhood Of Technology . Mr. Ken , are you sure you haven 't receive any solicitation from this group ? This doesn 't make sense . All members of this organization are renowned scientists . Are you saying that I 'm lying ? That 's not what I meant . He 's a genius . Many call him the modern Freud . He 's an outstanding psychiatrist . He 's also the head of a scientific consortium . We suspect that he is the leader of Brotherhood Of Technology . I don 't think this group is after money , because Billy Conners is already one of the top ten billionaires . We 're both scientists , but I am a lot poorer ! I 've decided on Tai-pang . Besides him , I don 't need anybody else to protect me . OK . If you have so much faith in Detective Chiu , we are more than happy to have him protect you . If you need anything else , just call us . Have you noticed anything odd in Sun 's behavior after that ? After what ? After Adele 's death ! Nothing odd . Everything seems normal . Did he skip work at all ? Then why did he go sailing yesterday ? It 's normal to go sailing on Sundays . Think about it . If your boyfriend just passed away , wouldn 't you just stay home and cry your heart out ? Would you still go to work at all ? He 's being normal in a most abnormal way . Janis . Yes ? - Do you have any painkillers ? - Sure . Boss . After I 'm tired of Panadol , I 'll try Aspirin . Why not try some chocolate ? It 's not healthy to take so many pills . You 're so silly ! This is not instant coffee . You need to use a coffeepot ! Wait ! You need a filter too . Thanks . Let me help you . Takes me forever just to make a cup of coffee . No kidding . Is that enough ? Are you new here ? Yes . Today is only my third day . What is your name ? My name is Adele . A-d-e-I-e , with a stroke above the last e . My French teacher chose the name for me . Very annoying , isn 't it ? Very . By the way , I can make you coffee when I make one for my boss later . Who 's your boss ? His last name is Ken . Then you can just make one for your boss . Mr. Ken . So ... you are Adele ? You are Mr. Ken . Mr. Ken , I 'll bring the coffee to your room when it 's ready . Fine . Thanks . Mr. Ken . What is it , Mr. Ken ? This is for you . Are you free for dinner tonight ? I 'm sorry , but I have classes tonight . How about tomorrow night ? Fine . I 'm leaving . Bye . Everything here is firewall protected to prevent our computer systems from Hackers breaking in . Just seeing all these rolls of wiring gives me the creeps . - Teresa . - Clarence . - Is Mr. Ken back yet ? - He 's in his office . Let me introduce . This is Clarence , our systems director . - He 's also Mr. Ken 's classmate . - How do you do ? This is detective Chiu , Mr. Ken 's bodyguard . Is Mr. Ken in trouble ? Nothing major . So you 've known him for quite some time ? Yes , ever since our university days . Do you recall him offending any person lately ? Sure , tons of them . Once our VOD becomes popular , many computer guys would need a career change . Have you noticed anything unusual about him lately ? Well , there had been some minor mistakes on his recent orders , and Mr. Ken seldom makes mistakes . I 'll have to go find Mr. Ken . OK . Thanks . Anything else to see ? Let 's get this over with . Something that will blow you away . What is it ? VOD . Once you 've installed our Video On Demand system , your home TV would turn from one way into a two-way communication . Miss Wong . So what 's the fuss about VOD ? It 's just a TV set ! Just listen to her . It will allow you to watch the movie you want just by entering a code . This is nothing new . You can register by phone and then follow the movie time slot . What you 're referring to is limited by the time slot . With VOD , you can watch it whenever you like . It 's two different things . So stop interrupting her , dumbass ! Furthermore , with VOD movies , you can fast forward , pause , and rewind , just like watching it on videotape . Besides movies , you can also surf the net , do grocery shopping or shop for other things online . If combined with the use of a SMART card , you can even transfer your money from your bank . It 's very convenient . You 'd need a big bunch of wires for so many functions . It 's not convenient at all ! A man like you can be so ignorant . All you need is a phone line . I 'm just talking to myself , woman . Mind your own business . Don 't pretend to be an expert . How can a phone line that thin carry so many functions ? Ask the professionals if you don 't believe me ! Actually , this lady is right . The greatest breakthrough of our VOD is that it uses just one single fiber optic line . See ? Even she agrees that you don 't know anything ! - Why , you ... you ... - Elaine , please continue . So uneducated ! Mr. Ken pages us to a meeting in the War Room . War Room ? Is that a place for wars ? Almost . This is where we do our research and analysis . Only a few people have access . You 've met Clarence . This is Kim . He has several doctorate degrees . I can also read your fortune . I 'm good at that . I 'm TC . I used to be in Pathology . But not anymore . Is orange juice OK ? Sun , have you offended anyone lately ? There 'll soon be many . Once we launch our VOD , every telecommunication company will be affected . Such as ? Such as networks , video distributors , and Internet Service Providers . Especially ISP 's . My feelings exactly . If someone wants Mr. Ken dead , I suppose it would be those internet or software development firms . That 's a lot of people ! Not really . Only the top five firms would feel most threatened by Mr. Ken . Teresa , search the net for the list of top level managers from these firms . Sure . It can 't be that serious . VOD is television . It 's different from computers . They 're not that different . TV is family entertainment . But Internet is for one individual . It 's like salt and sugar . Would you substitute salt for sugar ? Besides , there 're bankers , doctors , and chemists among the victims . They may not be just pinpointing me . So ? So what ? If the murderers can kill by spontaneous combustion , then there 's nothing I can do to prevent them from killing me . Why waste your time thinking about this ? Are you that smart ? Sorry . What is it ? Nothing . Let 's eat ! Are you sure you can cook ? Why not ? My specialty is not studying , but making instant noodles . I was one of the " Ten Best Instant Noodles " winners in college . Then you 'll do the cooking from now on . But they withdrew the prize afterwards . They said that I cheated . Let 's get married . You 're nuts . The more reason to get married . Hey , don 't move around . I don 't want to , that 's why I want to get married . Come on . You will regret it ! I won 't know that until after the wedding . Fine ! But first , you have to gain 10 pounds . No problem . I want to spend our honeymoon in Prague . No problem . I 'll book the tickets tomorrow . Also , I 'll only marry a guy who has an Afro hairdo . Like that ? Close . - Forget it then . Let 's continue . - Damn you ! No need to guess . Those are the Prague tickets . I 've gained 3 pounds , and I 've booked the flights . As for the hairdo ... I 've got a sample . The stylist should know what to do ! Do you have any vacation left ? Of course ! That 's right . Senior staff like you have flexible time off . Junior staff like me don 't have such luxuries . That 's right . What should we do ? We 'll have to wait . I 'll return the tickets . Don 't you dare ! How long is the trip ? 2 weeks ? You 've even got a small dock down there . That kills me . That 's really cute . I 've always felt that your house is like a morgue . Metal everywhere . Some wood would help . Roundtrip tickets for two to Prague ? It 's about to expire . Return them ! Why did you leave them here ? Don 't waste them . Don 't touch my stuff . Better get a refund soon . - Might as well use the money on dinner . - Don 't touch my stuff ! Why are you so upset ? She 's been dead for so long . Why hang on to them ? For decoration ? They 're not even pretty ! Why do you care ? Why did you ask me to come here ? What the hell do you need me for ? I 'm useless to you . - Your duty is to protect me . - Are you crazy ? Protect you ? I don 't know jack shit about your Hi-tech , body explosion stuff . I 'm just a cop ! You think I 'm a scientist ? ! Ask those Ml6 guys to protect you then ! I 'm only here to chat with you , man ! You just want to die ! That 's easy . Just bang your head on the wall . No need to wait til you explode ! Why drag me into this ? If you want to die , do it on your own . You should know what I mean . Are you hungry ? I just don 't know what to do with you ! Of course I 'm hungry . I haven 't eaten all day . What would you like ? I 'll bring you to a nice place . Do you trust me ? The vendors are still here . They 'll be gone if you don 't come here often enough . What do you want ? Hurry up with your orders . Combination noodles . Shrimp noodles for me . No onions . Hey ! I know you two ! It took you long enough ! You need new glasses ! Eat some more . Go away ! Get lost ! No , no ... I can 't take your money . - Careful . It 's hot ! - Let 's eat . Wow ! This is really spicy ! I thought you always wanted extra spicy . You can 't take this now ? You could when you were younger ! Hey , I didn 't order sausage ! It 's on the house . Then at least give me more than just two slices . What a miser ! You haven 't changed a bit , especially that big mouth of yours . Did you finish school ? What are you up to now ? Installing antennas . That bad ? No wonder you look so sad . Nobody uses antennas nowadays . Even I don 't use it . Don 't you worry . Those antennas are still big in China and Vietnam . Plenty of chances , young man ! Combination noodles ! Can 't you wait a minute ? Why not tell him how much you really have ? Eat your noodles ! Where were we ? You were lecturing him . Do continue . He 's really depressed . Right . It doesn 't matter what you do , as long as you are happy . Just take a look at my noodle place . Many rich folks come to eat here . Whenever I 'm off , they 'll have to settle for those wonton noodles next door . Those noodles are just plain shit ! Where 's your daughter ? Don 't even talk about her . But you do have a daughter ... I said , don 't even talk about her ! Young people nowadays ... At least you two still remember me . Nostalgia is a good thing ! Don 't look so sad . Your noodles ? My treat ! What about mine ? Of course you have to pay , big mouth ! I have to get back to work . This world stinks more and more by the day . Not as bad as your mouth . Maybe , but it has a sweet taste . Want to try ? That 's it . Smile and you won 't blow up . Motherfucker ! Pay up ! Pay up ! Why won 't you pay up ? None of your business ! Police ! Freeze ! Police ! Stop fighting ! Thanks . What 's with you ? You and that Ml6 dog are always following us . Where is he now ? You think it 's easy to follow you around ? But we are really concerned about Mr. Ken 's safety . Maybe you 're worried about my competence even more . I 'm watching him , but you 're watching me . Do you want me to screw up in front of Ml6 ? But you did screw up , didn 't you ? Try not to protect your image all the time . Yes , Madam . You 're the boss . Madam , you 're here ! Your lab report is already out . Have you got it ? I 've got it . Thanks . What report ? Were you not feeling well ? Hey ... what lab report ? There is no sign of fracture or hemorrhage in your skull . If that 's the case , can I be discharged ? If you stay one more night , we can make sure that there is no future damage to your brain . We 'll arrange to have this patient transferred to another ward . Just stay here and rest . It 's for your protection . But I really want to go home . Please be patient . Get some rest . Hey , you . Got into a fight ? Did it hurt ? No . Did you throw up ? No . Then you should be fine . You can leave . I get hit on the head a lot . My mom said I 'll be fine as long as I don 't throw up . It 's only pain . You 'll be alright . Relax . What 's your name ? My last name is Ken . I asked for your name , not just your last name ! What 's wrong with you ? Sorry . My name is Tit-sun . My name is Brother Chuen . How do you do ? How do you do ? Why did they tie you up ? Isn 't that obvious enough ? I 'm crazy . I bite people . They want to get Chucky . So I bit them . Who 's Chucky ? Chucky is very famous . He barks really loud . All other dogs are scared of him . You look ugly when you laugh . Let me tell you something really funny . My mother lost a bet . She often said that she would live longer than I would . But this time , I won . She went to bed 2 days ago and never woke up . The doctor told me she 's dead . Do you miss her ? Of course . But I can only miss her for a while each day . I 'm really busy , you know . I have to check on those hawkers at the market everyday for fraud . And I have to make sure that cars won 't hit the kids when they cross . I even have to feed Chucky . Damn ! I wonder if Chucky ate breakfast this morning ? Have you got a girlfriend ? Yes , a while ago . There is a nurse here . She 's really pretty . She wears a Mickey Mouse watch . My mom said that I 'm all grown up now . I really would like to start a relationship . What is it then ? Nothing . Then why did you come here for a lab test ? Just for fun ? Come on , tell me about it . X-ray reveals a black spot in my stomach . The doctor suspected cancer , so he took some samples for analysis . What did the report say ? It can 't be cancer . You don 't even smoke or drink ! You should be fine . Don 't be like this . The doctor said that the black spot is only food that 's not digested . He said I should cut down on pickled eggs . You had me all worried ! I apologize , Mr. Ken . We 'll transfer him now . There 's no need . We got along pretty well . That 's right . We 're friends . Your name is Sunny . I forgot my business cards . This is my business card . Call me if you need any help . Why would I need help ? I 'm the one who help others . If anyone bullies you here , just say that you know me . I 'm notorious around here . Thank you so much . You 're too corny . I 'm not talking to you anymore ! Are you transferring me to another room or not ? Right . Let 's go . Sorry , Mr. Ken . Remember . Just tell them that you know me . Sun , did you bump your head ? Does it hurt ? What is it ? Have you seen Adele ? What ? Impossible ! Adele was just here ! - It 's just your delusion . - No ! I even felt her touch . - She was standing right there ! - Alright . You get some sleep . I 'll call the doctor . Lie down . This card was not here before ! Ask the hospital staff if they saw anyone leaving it here . How could this be ? This address is top secret . That 's where Mr. Sato is . Sato ? ! The one who did the Biology I.C. research ? Yes . It was he who told us about Brotherhood Of Technology . He 's under Ml6 's protection . It 's impossible that anyone else would have known this address . Help ! Help ! Madam ! They were never out of this room . And there 's nothing here . What 's the burning smell ? I don 't know . It 's the smell of human flesh ! Did you see Mr. Sato ? He 's gone ! How could he just disappear ? Spontaneous combustion again ? Doesn 't look like it . If it is , the people beside him would still be alive . Well ? Human explosion again ? I 'll take a look . Sam ! - Please let me go , Dr. Ken . - Sorry . Please wait . Ivy , let me do the forensics this time . Kim has already called someone from the Hong Kong University . Dr. Ken , you should follow the rules . James asked us to do the forensics . But James is not here yet . Madam , this will look bad for our department . Do you want the truth or not ? Dr. Yip ! Dr. Wong ! Dr. Lau ! So are you the expert or are we the experts ? Of course you are . You were all my teachers . I 'll give you a report in two days . How about this , Dr. Yip ? Let me check it out first . I 'll let you examine after I 'm done . Then what 's there left for us to examine ? Our objective is to preserve the crime scene 's original state . I taught you that ! Sam , give us a hand . Coming ! According to the first witness and our own observations , the door was locked when the incident happened . There were two corpses in the room . But Mr. Sato had vanished . We found a large sum of cash and his credit cards . Also , the suit which Mr. Sato was last seen wearing was scattered all over the place . But there were no signs of struggle . This proves that the probability of a forced abduction was very low . If he has really left the place , it must be either voluntary , or he must have been unconscious . As for the autopsy report on the two Ml6 members , the cause of death was heart failure . All the other major organs simply failed simultaneously . I 've never done an autopsy on a cooked corpse before . They were microwaved to 80 % % % well done . They smelled like BBQ pork when I cut them open . You don 't have to be that detailed . What else ? Since the bodies were microwaved from the inside , all internal organs were cooked . Therefore , there were no bacteria to determine time of death . - The skin ... - Can you just skip to your conclusion ? Even though I couldn 't find any evidence from the corpses , I could still estimate their time of death to be around 10 to 10 : 07 pm . Without any evidence , how could you be so sure ? I imagined putting a 180lb piece of meat in a huge microwave oven , and calculated the time it takes to cook the meat . As simple as that ! Our satellite also ceased to receive signals for 15 seconds at 10 : 06 : 32 pm . It closely matches the time of death . We 've also checked the oven . Surprisingly , its microwave power exceeded its original design by ten times . How could that be ? I 'd like to know that myself . This doesn 't fit any scientific logic . We found a large amount of ashes and crystallized substances at the scene . From the analysis , they contain 3 elements . They are organic compound , protein , and the third ? Minerals . Are you telling me that the Japanese did not disappear ? Correct ! Theoretically , add 80 % % % of water , and " it " will turn back into a human being . What could 've done this ? Beats me ! If you dehydrate a person , he should only turn into a dry corpse at the most . But now we are seeing an actual , dissolved substance . Just like being shot dead by laser guns in a cartoon . Hey man , I 'm only kidding . He 's referring to Assault Satellites . There are now more than 800 satellites orbiting the earth . We only know the true usage of half of them . The rest are all classified military satellites . My knowledge is that the U.S. government has already tested laser and particle beam from these satellites successfully . It 's not too difficult to check . We can match the time of the incident with the positions of the satellites hovering above Hong Kong at that time . Dr. Yip , I still don 't understand . I 've handled a lot of crime scenes . Normally , when there are multiple bodies in a common crime scene , their cause of death is usually the same . So why did the Japanese dissolve into ashes , but not the other two guys ? One exploded , and the other turned into ashes . What about the other two guys ? James didn 't say anything about their deaths . Actually , even James himself didn 't know . One guy 's Iranian , and the other was Russian . Their cause of death was never announced . Why does killing people have to be this fancy ? Maybe they are experimenting . I think someone is trying to show off . - Mr. Sato might know more . - But he is dead . Our computers have always communicated with his . We can try breaking into his system . A break-in ? That 's illegal ! Do you have a better suggestion ? This is too big for us to handle . Cops ! Cops ! Cops ! Cops , Gator ! Are you Mr. Yao ? CID . What ... These are just games ! No X-rated stuff ! You can arrest me , but please don 't beat me up . We need your help . Sir , please don 't play games with me . How can small potatoes like us help you ? - But you ARE Gator , aren 't you ? - Are you crazy ? Gator my ass ! All I have are dead CPU 's . Uncle , you can stop pretending . I brought them here . You little piece of shit ! You betrayed me ! You 're asking for a beating ! Fine ! You can forget about descrambling all those Japanese porno discs of yours ! You little shit ! Mr. Yao , I urged Kim to bring me here . I 'm Ken Tit-sun . But you are so young ! You 're good ! You did something even the Japanese and Americans couldn 't . Transmitting video with just one single phone line . Smart ! You are truly a smart ass ! I need your help to save my life . Save your life ? This Japanese system is known for its superb firewalls . That 's why we need your help , Uncle . If you can break into his system , you 'll become a legend overnight . Even the Japanese will be running scared when they hear your name . You are running scared now ! You 're always bragging about your hacking skills . You try breaking in then . We have the technology , but we don 't have the expertise like you do . That 's true . I can 't match you when it comes to building things , but when it comes to breaking in ... Hey , wait a minute . This is illegal . You 've always been breaking the law . We only break small laws . We don 't break big ones . I don 't want handcuffs on my wrists . Madam , it 's your turn to speak . Our main objective is to protect Mr. Ken . We 'll turn our backs on anything else . - Right . She saw nothing . - Thanks . I must really learn from Gator this time . I have one condition though . I want a picture with you , so I can hang it on my storefront . Sure . OK . Andy , you handle the hardware . I 'll need 20 terminal linkups , the fastest modems and printers . You need to help me put together a hard disk of at least 20 gigs . Because I don 't know how much memory their system has . You help me copy these 20 hacker programs into the terminals . The rest of you will help me with the cables and monitors , OK ? OK ! - Any questions ? - No . Dismiss ! Done ? All set ! If the correct password is not entered within the first 15 minutes , the firewall will activate immediately . If we try to break in manually , it could take forever . It 's easy because that Japanese was a scientist . Scientists have a logical way of thinking . The same goes for their passwords . Also , check out his surroundings and what he likes . You can 't go wrong . What if his computer randomly chose the password for him ? We have three PCs working on that right now . Wish us luck ! Everyone , on your mark . Set ... Go ! I 'm out of codes ! What 's that ? Something about Japanese baseball . We 've used up their usernames ! Keep entering some more ! The machine just hangs ! Porn stars ? Let me ! There goes my reputation ! Hey , check this out . What is it ? What the hell did you enter ? Don 't know . I just randomly picked a phrase from here . " The final war between good and evil " ? These are all Buddhist scriptures . Nostradamus . What does it mean ? He was a very famous French prophet . He predicted Armageddon . Could this be a prank from Sato ? These are all from the Bible , the Koran , and the Sutra . But they all share the same theme , and that is the religion 's prediction for Armageddon . Buddhism emphasizes the idea of a beginning and an end , that there must be an end before there is a beginning . Sounds like Karma , but also sounds like Armageddon . The Buddhist Sutra reveals that the Great Wheel will turn once every 2,000 years . Each time it turns , Earth will encounter a big disaster . And it 's now 1997 . Aren 't you scared , pal ? In Japan , the Sun Moon God also talks about Armageddon . The gods will descend from the heavens after 3,000 years to destroy not only the world , but also the spiritual world . In the Koran , a large portion is devoted to Armageddon . It even predicts precisely that in July of 1999 , The King Of Horror will descend upon the earth . The Bible 's Book of Revelations said that there are seven signs that precede Armageddon . Maybe it has something to do with our case . The First Sign-the Antichrist will appear in the name of Satan . On that day , the fiery mountains will sink into the oceans . One third of the sea will turn into blood , and one third of the creatures in the sea will die . Even one third of all ships will be destroyed . Some believe that Sadaam Hussein is the Antichrist . And the Persian Gulf War matches the scenarios in Revelations . The Second Sign - A star that burns like a torch will descend from the sky , and fall into 1 / 3 of the world 's rivers . The star is called " Wormwood " . The river will become bitter , and because of that , many will die . " Wormwood " is a kind of herbs , but it 's also known by its nickname , " Chernobyl " . The same name as the Soviet nuclear power plant that suffered a meltdown . The Third Sign-The reappearance of the kingdom of Babylon . The layout of Babylon is very similar to that of modern day Europe . And I 'm sure you all know about the unification talks . The Fourth Sign-The reappearance of the Temple of Jerusalem . Remember Mr. Anderson ? His will stated that 50 billion British pounds under his name will be automatically donated to Jerusalem 's temple restoration efforts . Noah 's Ark will also reappear . As for Mr. Sato , he was dedicated to collecting DNA from each and every living creatures on earth . He didn 't want any of them to become extinct . Then ... It 's just like the Noah 's Ark theory , isn 't it ? The Sixth Sign - There will be a big earthquake . The moon will turn red , and all the stars will fall . The Seventh Sign - " Who does not believe in me will turn to me when the day comes " . On Judgement Day , everything without the seal of God will all be destroyed . Five of the seven signs had already appeared . You can say that Chernobyl and Saddam Hussein are just coincidences . But the rest seems to have been done by man . Could this be the work of some mad scientist , using the Bible as an excuse ? Think so ? Would someone be that dumb as to kill himself by creating Armageddon ? That 's why I said he 's mad . How can we read a madman 's mind ? Are you guys scientists or what ? All this superstitious babbling ! Do you know " Feng Shui " too ? I need it for my home . Sure . Give me your date of birth . There are many things that can 't be explained with science . There 's no point in arguing . I think the answer lies on this card . Although I can 't be sure how this card appears , I am very sure that Adele is dead . So what ? They used a ghost to give me the card . What ? A ghost ? She touched my head with her hand . I could actually feel her body warmth . I tried to catch her , but she simply vanished . Did you actually touch her ? No . But I don 't believe it 's a dream . I don 't think you can feel body warmth in dreams . Mr. Ken , you are a scientist yourself . Do you believe in ghosts ? I don 't know . That 's why I need your help . Besides this incident , have you ever seen Adele in your dreams ? Yes . How many times ? Many . I think it 's just pressure from your work . Steve , don 't give me this work pressure bullshit . Don 't tell me I 'm having illusions because I miss Adele too much . Even if they are , then how do you explain the card ? Do you think I made it up ? I don 't even know how to make up things like that ! Calm down . I can 't help you if you act like this . Rest a bit , please . Well ? I still think that he is mixing reality with his illusions . Have a drink . What does that mean ? Is he losing his mind ? He is just being hyper . Urbanites are a bunch of nervous wrecks . And the card ? How do you explain that ? Even he himself can 't be sure it 's Adele who left the card . The card 's origin and Adele 's appearance are two separate issues . Do you guys really believe that he saw Adele 's ghost ? Tai-pang ... Say it . Don 't come over ! Don 't be scared , you all . Don 't come near me ! I 've got a gun ! It 's me , Tai-pang . Put your gun down . It 's me ! Sun . Watch the door . Ivy ! Be careful . I don 't know WHAT she is ! Why are you here ? I don 't know . I really don 't know . Do you remember the past ? When 's your birthday ? June 20th . And mine ? July 21st . Remember your first words to me ? " You 're so silly ! " Now what ? Does this mean we 're all urban psychos ? Sunny baby , I am Adele . I miss you so much . Did Adele ever call you " Sunny baby " ? This is not your girlfriend . Not her . Fine , you can go . You 're in the wrong body . But I 'm not done . Yes , you are . Your money 's outside . Thanks . We 'll pay you outside . Fine , as long as I get paid . I 've told you this wouldn 't work . You 're wasting money . It 's just a try . Mr. Ken , he 's the spiritual advisor recommended by my friend . This house is really haunted . Hey , Peter . When did you become a psychic ? Wow ! Turns out this house is haunted by cops ! Sorry , Detective Chiu ! I 'm going ! It 's been a long day . You must all be tired . Go home . Come on ! Maybe all these people here scared her off . I 'll find you an even more powerful psychic later . How come the name is changed ? ! She 's been here . Tickets to Prague in 2 days ? Why is my name on it ? I think someone wants us to go to Prague . This is too spooky for me . I 'm not going ! I 'm telling you . You can count me out . Whatever . Don 't you talk to me like that ! I 'm really not going ! How come it 's so cold ? ! My toes are all frozen ! What the hell did I do wrong ? Why am I here in Prague ? I said I wasn 't coming ! Why did you do this to me ? Adele and I thought of getting married here . Therefore , it 's not odd for her to meet me here . You think I haven 't done my research ? I 've checked the travel agency . They said the tickets were booked under your company 's name . Maybe someone in your office is pulling a prank on you . Could it be Janis ? There are so many personnel in my company . Anyone could 've used our name and booked the tickets . I trust Janis more than I trust you . Then why didn 't you ask Janis to come ? ! Do we have to check each and every church here in Prague ? Adele really liked the churches here . Why can 't she pick the tropics or some place warmer ? Why Prague ? Here 's your hot drink . It 's freezing ! Exactly ! What the hell are we here for ? You , maybe . But why me ? She 's not even my girl ! Don 't get mad . After the drink , we 'll start from the first church again . Give it a chance . It shouldn 't be hard to find a Chinese girl here ... You mean a Chinese ghost ! You 'll have better luck at the cemetery ! Cemetery ? ! You 're right . I know ... Now I know why she wants you here . - I 'm just kidding , man . - Come on . I 'm only kidding ! Me and my big mouth ! There 's hardly any ghost here . Can we go now ? Let 's walk some more . How about this ? We 'll wait here till they close the gates . You 're kidding ! I can barely walk . There 's no way I can just stand and wait . Jog on the same spot then . Adele , if you really want to see me , just reveal yourself . Hey ! You can 't take off your hat here . Sorry . Hey ! Watch out ! You almost got run over . Why are you sighing ? It 's gorgeous here . No need to sigh for that . I sigh because I 'm with you . Pretty place like this is for a man and a woman . If only Ivy could be here . Fine . We 'll book our return flight tomorrow . No need . We still have so many places to go . There 's no hurry . Besides , I haven 't tried Table Dance yet . Perhaps Adele likes neither churches nor cemeteries . Maybe she likes Table Dance too ! Let 's take a picture , just to prove that we 've been here . Can you get the geese and the ducks too ? Hurry up . Adele ! - Take your jacket off ! - I 'm doing it ! HURRY ! I 've never bought any women 's clothes before . So don 't yell at me if you don 't like them . You are one hungry ghost ! I haven 't eaten for a long time . Do you remember being hit by a car here ? Yes , but then , it felt like I was asleep , and I even dreamt about you . Do you remember visiting me ? Of course ! You even pointed your gun at me . You chicken shit . Hey , I was scared . You 're a ghost ! I 'm NOT a ghost ! Drink this . It 'll warm you up . You know I don 't drink . Why are you testing me ? But I ... I just cannot accept the fact that you ... You 've been cremated , but now you 're here . Don 't you want to see me ? Of course ! You have a new girlfriend . No , I don 't ! Be honest . Tell me the truth . I can take it . Just tell me ! No , I really don 't . You 're still lying ? ! I can see it in your eyes . Do you have a new girl ? Ask him . You ask him whether I have one . I don 't want to ask him . I 'm asking you ! You better clear this up . Listen to me . - Are you lying ? - I swear ! I swear ! OK ? That 's it ! She 's definitely your girl . Definitely ! Are we really getting married here ? Do you like it ? As long as you won 't regret it . Of course I won 't ! You two are making me sick . Are you scared ? You can go on if you are . I 'm getting goose bumps . Call Ivy and tell her to come too . I 've called her already ! She 's verifying her fingerprints in Hong Kong right now . She 's really the boring workaholic type . Not as boring as a nerd like you ! What is it ? This is too strange . If I tell this to anyone , they 're going to say I 'm crazy . Doesn 't all this seem like a dream to you ? Doesn 't matter . The most important thing is that she 's really back . Right ? Hey , come over here . What 's up ? This is so pretty ! Look ! Where ? I don 't see it . You asked for it ! You 're going to be broke this time . Isn 't this beautiful ? ADELE ! Wait ! Adele ! Calm down ! Are you crazy ? Get back here ! - Just let me go ! - Get up ! Dr. Ken , don 't worry . Adele will be back . The most important thing is that you know she 's real . Adele ? Where is she ? So you 're the one behind everything ? Everything is God 's will . I 'm just his messenger . God ? ! What God ? Besides God , who else can be this powerful ? I give you this ring . Wear it when you 're back in Hong Kong . Can 't move ? I 'm afraid you might get too excited . Go to hell ! You don 't excite me ! I 've always said that foreigners are the craziest of all ! Get him ! Let me kick his ass ! Why take her away from me and shatter my heart ? And in a lapse of time , bid farewell to happiness ? My feeble hands were unable to comfort my broken heart Hard to let go , with only tears in my eyes How did this happen ? How can I solve this mystery ? The burden too heavy , the pain too much A regret that I cannot face Never thought I was that close when I lost my love ... Take a look at this . Some I can name and some I can 't . Cost me a month 's salary . This is powerful shit . You will be safe with this . Besides , I 'm with you . Don 't worry . I 'll go by myself tonight . I didn 't get it . Come again ? I feel a sense of danger here . But I really want to see Adele again , so ... So what ? Are you giving up now ? That Billy Conners is just another con man ! He 's an authority figure in Psychology . He studies ESP . SO ? He 's a high class con man then ! Then how do you explain Adele ? How would I know ? You 're the scientist and you 're asking ME ? ! Because even I can 't explain it myself . Don 't be scared . If he does anything funny , I 'll beat the shit out of him . Don 't you worry . You don 't understand . You really don 't ! You 've got Ivy . You 've never lost your most beloved . I really want to see Adele again . What does that mean ? Call me when you need me , and kick me out when you don 't need me anymore ? ! Who do you think I am ? A call girl ? That 's not what I meant ! Sorry . Am I interrupting ? Of course not . We 're just chatting . Boss , do you want to join our party ? No , I 'm not going . Lots of good food there ! You guys have fun tonight . Alright then . We 're going . Janis . Walk Tai-pang to the door for me . Tai-pang ! Merry Christmas . I 'll wish you a Merry Christmas if I still see you tomorrow . Ken . I said I 'm not going . Have fun tonight . I 'm not talking about that party . Welcome to our party . Come on . He 's here . - Hi , Clarence . - Hello ! Ken , welcome . Johnny ? ! Surprised ? There are lots of familiar faces here . Hello , Ken ! We knew you 'd join us sooner or later . Welcome . Where 's Adele ? She 's fine . Don 't you worry . Let the ceremony begins . Drink this , Dr. Ken . I don 't understand . You still don 't ? I 've told you . I 'm here to welcome you . Is murder part of your welcome too ? They died to prove God 's power . So you admit to killing all those people ? That 's all I need . POLICE ! Freeze ! Freeze ! You know how excited I am . Chuck , bring him here . Watch out for his tricks . Tai-pang , where 's your " stick " ? One of them must work ! Tell me . Where 's Adele ? Why ? Why don 't you believe me ? - It is God 's will ... It is God 's will ... - Tell me . Tell me where Adele is ! You tell me where she is ! Why didn 't you believe him ? He cured my terminal cancer in just one day . Hey , wait . Thanks . What ? Are you afraid he 's not dead ? Maybe he 'll resurrect . Did you regret it ? Not at all . He 's a con man and a killer . But he 's known to perform miracles . Where 's Tit-sun ? He wants to sit around longer . Marry me ? Don 't be silly . You never know what will happen tomorrow . Why ? Why can 't I accept anything beyond science ? Is it because I 'm too smart , or just plain ignorant ? Stop the car ! Tell them to go back ! Call the ambulance ! What 's that ? If you believe me , I will not disappoint you . I 'll have a surprise for you . Your friend is a real pain in the butt . Why do you care so much about life and death ? Tai-pang ! Get out of here ! Actually , they 're no big deal . Are you nuts ? ARE YOU ? So you like killing ? KILL ME THEN ! KILL ME ! Pain all over ! So that 's how it feels to have a hole in your chest ! Sun , it is so clear to me now . The brothers and sisters in this group are all carefully chosen by Him to assist you . What exactly are you trying to say ? You won 't understand . He gives you a quota to select a group of people and accomplish the last mission . Last mission ? ! Yeah ! What is it ? Armageddon ! The moon turning red and the earthquakes ... All the signs have appeared . There 's only one sign left now . Once a non-believer like you starts to have faith , then it 's done ! It 's easy for geniuses like you to create Armageddon . How many do I need to choose ? 1,500 . You 're saying that only 1,500 people will survive Armageddon ? ! Doesn 't matter ! It 's the end of the world ! What 's the difference between life and death ? You and the remaining 1,500 people will turn into gods and recreate a perfect world . By then , the new world will have no war , no starvation , no disease , not even triads . Everybody just sings Karaoke everyday . Isn 't that wonderful ? And you , you 'll be our leader . Isn 't it cool ? I can choose whomever I want ? Of course ! You 're His son , and I 'm your buddy . Remember to save me a spot , OK ? Just say the word , and lvy will resurrect , just like Adele . Why are you so clear minded all of a sudden ? How could you understand the whole picture ? It 's a miracle ! Even now , you still don 't believe in Him ? I 'm not saying that I don 't believe in Him , but ... It 's the truth ! Haven 't you heard of the truth ? Then , is the truth right or wrong ? You ... you still have to ask this ? Survival of the fittest is the law of nature , and that 's also the truth . Is that right or wrong ? You said that , out of millions of people , only 1,500 will survive Armageddon . Do you think that 's right ? But they deserve to die ! Look what they 've done to the world ! All that pollution ! Even if you don 't create Armageddon , the world will end sooner or later ! If He really wants them to change , why can 't He just come out and say it ? I guarantee that they will believe Him and change ... So what 's your point ? You 're not Tai-pang . He wouldn 't ask me like that . He knows I won 't do it . Why can 't you understand ? This is already predestined . The world can change for the better . Just like you can change into Tai-pang , right ? You 'll lose Adele . I was dead already . We haven 't lost anything . Besides , it 's almost the end of the world . No point for me to come back . Someone will do this ! Even if you don 't , someone else will ! Find someone else then . I don 't want to be another Judas . You will both go to Hell ! Go to Hell ? It 's already Armageddon . What 's so scary about Hell ? We 'll go together . Fool ! You 're such a fool ! God ! Please execute your last judgement ! Pain all over ! So that 's how it feels to have a hole in your chest ! Damn ! Why did you hit me so hard ? ! Are you Tai-pang ? Who else could I be ? Your dad ? It 's like a nightmare ! Good . Now everything is ... Don 't come near . It 's alright now . How do you know ? I 'm already dead . What if I vanish again ? Don 't come any closer ! I 'm afraid I 'll vanish again . Promise me ... Promise me you won 't miss me anymore ? Adele , I ... Just stay there and listen ! There may not be another chance . If I do disappear , promise me you 'll live a good life . I don 't want to see you sad . You only live once . I was already dead . I 've already earned my extra time by seeing you again . No , you won 't . You won 't vanish again . Listen to me ... That 's what we thought when we were in Prague . Just promise that you won 't miss me . I know I won 't miss you ! I think I 'll go to heaven or get reincarnated . I promise you . I 'll live well . I 'll go out , and I 'll date other girls , alright ? But I won 't let you cook instant noodles for your new girlfriends . I 'm really afraid I 'll vanish again ! No , you won 't . I 'll never leave you . No man is that devoted . Sure there is . I 'm proud to present the most devoted husband , Ken Tit-sun . You 're bad ! Ivy ! Lvy ! I 'm here ! I thought it was Armageddon ? How come you get to have all the fun ? I think if we had accepted his mission , then that would 've been the end of the world . So it was a test ? What kind of a naughty god is that ? He didn 't say . But I guess they 're all the same . Anyway , just don 't do anything that would hurt other people . Does marrying Ivy count as hurting others ? I better reconsider . Forget it . You 're going to hell for sure ! Yeah right ! If I can choose , I 'll definitely choose Armageddon . Fine , fine . I 've told you . Everything would be alright . You 're so brave ! Really ? My mom said that about me all the time ! " The Health Department is stunned that Christmas was the first day in Hong Kong history where there were no deaths . They believe it was a miracle that the 4 critically injured survive . As for the strange lightshow at the Hong Kong Stadium , the government is at a loss for explanation ... " What is this ? Hey ! What 's going on ? All the satellite signals are gone ! Get someone here , quick ! Lam , call Engineering and have them check the backups . Sorry to call you back on your wedding day . What is it ? The end of the world ? Some big shit like that ! What is it then ? All the satellite signals were disconnected . Only the underwater cables are still functioning . Stanley station is still checking the backups . Hong Kong # 1 is down , we couldn 't get signals from # 2 and # 4 , and # 6 is toasted . What should we do ? Call the Doctor . We still haven 't found him . Oh ! He 's over there ! Hello ? Dr. Ken ! What is it ? I 've been trying to call you . Something major is going down at Stanley ! Mr. Ken , Mr. John is already here . The satellite signal was completely down for 30 minutes . It 's back to normal now , but all the backups are gone . Initial investigation shows no signs of sabotage . As for the breakdown , we simply couldn 't determine the cause . You 'll have to figure that out . Thank you so much . Let 's go . That 's it ! What did the Observatory say ? The sunspots showed no irregular activities in the past 24 hours , and there 're no record of planetary explosions . Even Guangzhou and Shenzhen reported nothing special . In other words , it only happened in Hong Kong . Look , even the server is toasted . We should 've easily detected such high levels of energy . Yes , I understand . I understand perfectly , but ... But you know we can 't operate without a backup system ! We 'll create our own if we have to ! Right ... Call the insurance company right away . Well ? Is Clarence still upset ? You would be too if it were you . But I don 't think anyone needs to be responsible . The antenna was wrecked by Him . Looks like the insurance company will suffer the most . They 'll lose their pants ! Mr. Ken said it 'd be a few more minutes . Did you tell him this is regarding his own life ? I did , but he 's dealing with something even more important . More important than his own life ? That 's what he said ! Wait . Excuse me ! - Why are you here ? - Why are you here ? My buddy called me here ! Chiu Tai-pang , from Sun Leung Tam , CID . Nice to meet you . Detective Chiu , you 're here ! Boss said to see him the moment you 're here . Detective Chiu ! It 's okay . I know them . What shit are you in now , classmate ? So many cops here to see you . - Mr. Chan . - Inspector Yip , James from the UK . - Hello ! - How do you do ? Take a seat . What can I do for you ? In the past 3 months , 3 scientists had died mysteriously . They all had one thing in common . They were voted " Top Ten Future Leaders " by Century Magazine . Mr. Ken , were you on that list as well ? We have reasons to believe that your life is in danger . So this flimsy piece of paper is the " Top Ten Future Leaders " certificate ? So this flimsy piece of paper is the " Top Ten Future Leaders " certificate ? Yup ! Any prize money ? Nope . Let me explain this to you , Big Eyes . Do you know each year the U.N. chooses only 10 people as mankind 's future leaders ? I was one of them , AND also the first Chinese ever selected . What 's so smart about you then ? I 'll make it simple for you . Before , it took this size of cable to transmit data . Now , this will do the trick . - Is that it ? - That 's it ! Then I have something here that 'd make you even happier ! What is it ? Congratulations , Mr. Ken , you 've been awarded ... " Best Boyfriend Of The Year " ! Aren 't you a happier man now ? Are you proud ? Any prize money ? No . Prizes ? Nope . No way ! I 've got to have something ! Mr. Ken . Mr. Ken ? Have you ever heard of a group called " Brotherhood Of Technology " ? Uh ... no . Never mind . Really , I 've never heard of them , and I 've never received anything from this group . Hold it . Are you taking his statements ? What 's the charge ? You don 't have to answer them . You 're a cop too . Don 't interfere with our work . I 'm off duty now , and I 'm speaking as his friend . We do not suspect Mr. Ken . We 're just concerned about his safety . Do you know Liam Anderson ? I do . He died last night . Why wasn 't this announced ? We have to keep it confidential because his death was very peculiar . Mr. Ken , let me ask you once again . Where were you at around 10 : 30 last night ? That was when our satellite signal went down ! The antenna was burnt at around that time . By the way , Madam , why was Mr. Anderson in Hong Kong ? We 're not too sure either . He was reported missing in Edinburgh , and was selected as Chairman of Global Bank just last month . Ml6 has always thought he was kidnapped by terrorists . Was he rich ? Not really , but he 's influential enough to control half of Europe 's cash flow . Wow , that was one hell of an explosion ! Really ? Hey , Detective Chiu ! Are you transferred back to the city ? Did you get promoted ? Promoted ? You 've got to be kidding . I wish . My superiors asked me to forward these to some big shot . Turns out that big shot is you ! I mean , I have a higher ranking , a better paycheck , and a bigger condo . But you 're the man ! Hey , Detective , is it an in-thing now just to wear the gun case ? Is the info here ? Who are you ? These are confidential ! Ah ... Dr. Ken ! He is Dr. Ken Tit-sun . Dr. Ken ? Don 't you specialize in information transmission technology ? I don 't suppose you 're an expert in forensics ? I 'm just doing research . Please ... Thanks . Obviously , there was an explosion at the scene . According to witnesses ' statements , they think that the explosives were already attached to the victim 's body . Was anybody else there at the time ? Did anyone else get hurt ? Well ... one was over here , the other one was over there . But they 're both lucky . They only received slight burns on the skin . According to the record , Mr. Anderson weighed about 175 pounds , but his identifiable remains totaled less than 10 pounds . That includes a portion of the liver , one section of the spine , one complete left foot , and a shoe and sock that were hardly torched . There 's also his skull , but it 's completely deformed . A deformed skull ? Sure ! The skull is the hardest part of the body . It 's more difficult to alter it . You need at least 3000 degrees Celsius to perform cremation . The explosion only lasted half a second . It must 've been really powerful ! Have you performed an autopsy on his spine , liver and skull ? Yes . It 's all in here . Does the report state that the inside was burnt , but the outside was normal ? Bingo ! Perfect ! Were there any traces of explosives ? Well , that 's the oddest thing . A Ml6 member claimed that he saw the victim 's bible catching fire first . But all was not burnt . The last chapter remains . As for traces of explosives , we couldn 't find any near the crime scene . Did you notice the sticky grease stain ? We 're running it through the lab . We think it 's only burnt lard . Do you think it 's human ? Are you serious ? You mean this ? I believe it 's spontaneous combustion . The U.S. has recorded cases of spontaneous combustion as early as 1952 . The evidence was very similar to the ones at the tower . But how can someone just explode ? The human body consists mostly of water . Water is H2O . Both hydrogen and oxygen are the most inflammable substances . Why can 't there be an explosion ? What caused the explosion then ? Even though there had been a few instances , no reasonable explanation can be found . Did Mr. Anderson die of natural causes ? I don 't know . But , if someone can somehow cause another human to combust , and if that person wants to kill me , I don 't think anyone can protect me . I do not wish to be followed by strangers . Furthermore , I don 't believe someone 's trying to kill me . The police are just concerned about your safety , Mr. Ken . I know . I think you just want a cop to protect me , to show your boss that you 've done your jobs . Tai-pang will do ! This time I must agree with him . This shit is huge , and you want me to protect you ? You 're playing with your life ! You better ask for a Ml6 . No , really . Detective Chiu ! Sorry , Mr. Ken . This gentleman claimed to be from Tak Ying Sauna . He said he must say something very important to Detective Chiu in person . Hey ! How 's the assignment coming along ? Detective Chiu ! I 've told you to wait outside for me , man ! I better give this to you personally , sir . I did great this time , didn 't I ? Not bad , huh ? Janis , show this gentleman out . Sir , this way . Hey , didn 't you say you 've got some ... V stuff , some real powerful shit ? - Can I see it ? - Sure ! Ask Teresa to show you around . Your company has quite a setup ! Lots of staff ! Were you Mr. Ken 's classmate back in Cambridge ? Which field were you in ? It 's true that we 're old classmates ... back in elementary school . But it 's quite a famous school . It 's all my old man 's fault . I couldn 't get in high school because he didn 't get the janitor job . Wow ! This HDTV tank looks real ! Such high resolution ! Do you need to feed them with electric worms ? You can still laugh even though it 's not funny . Any progress from the police investigation ? We believe that the murders are all related to Brotherhood Of Technology . Mr. Ken , are you sure you haven 't receive any solicitation from this group ? This doesn 't make sense . All members of this organization are renowned scientists . Are you saying that I 'm lying ? That 's not what I meant . He 's a genius . Many call him the modern Freud . He 's an outstanding psychiatrist . He 's also the head of a scientific consortium . We suspect that he is the leader of Brotherhood Of Technology . I don 't think this group is after money , because Billy Conners is already one of the top ten billionaires . We 're both scientists , but I am a lot poorer ! I 've decided on Tai-pang . Besides him , I don 't need anybody else to protect me . OK . If you have so much faith in Detective Chiu , we are more than happy to have him protect you . If you need anything else , just call us . Have you noticed anything odd in Sun 's behavior after that ? After what ? After Adele 's death ! Nothing odd . Everything seems normal . Did he skip work at all ? Then why did he go sailing yesterday ? It 's normal to go sailing on Sundays . Think about it . If your boyfriend just passed away , wouldn 't you just stay home and cry your heart out ? Would you still go to work at all ? He 's being normal in a most abnormal way . Janis . Yes ? - Do you have any painkillers ? - Sure . Boss . After I 'm tired of Panadol , I 'll try Aspirin . Why not try some chocolate ? It 's not healthy to take so many pills . You 're so silly ! This is not instant coffee . You need to use a coffeepot ! Wait ! You need a filter too . Thanks . Let me help you . Takes me forever just to make a cup of coffee . No kidding . Is that enough ? Are you new here ? Yes . Today is only my third day . What is your name ? My name is Adele . A-d-e-I-e , with a stroke above the last e . My French teacher chose the name for me . Very annoying , isn 't it ? Very . By the way , I can make you coffee when I make one for my boss later . Who 's your boss ? His last name is Ken . Then you can just make one for your boss . Mr. Ken . So ... you are Adele ? You are Mr. Ken . Mr. Ken , I 'll bring the coffee to your room when it 's ready . Fine . Thanks . Mr. Ken . What is it , Mr. Ken ? This is for you . Are you free for dinner tonight ? I 'm sorry , but I have classes tonight . How about tomorrow night ? Fine . I 'm leaving . Bye . Everything here is firewall protected to prevent our computer systems from Hackers breaking in . Just seeing all these rolls of wiring gives me the creeps . - Teresa . - Clarence . - Is Mr. Ken back yet ? - He 's in his office . Let me introduce . This is Clarence , our systems director . - He 's also Mr. Ken 's classmate . - How do you do ? This is detective Chiu , Mr. Ken 's bodyguard . Is Mr. Ken in trouble ? Nothing major . So you 've known him for quite some time ? Yes , ever since our university days . Do you recall him offending any person lately ? Sure , tons of them . Once our VOD becomes popular , many computer guys would need a career change . Have you noticed anything unusual about him lately ? Well , there had been some minor mistakes on his recent orders , and Mr. Ken seldom makes mistakes . I 'll have to go find Mr. Ken . OK . Thanks . Anything else to see ? Let 's get this over with . Something that will blow you away . What is it ? VOD . Once you 've installed our Video On Demand system , your home TV would turn from one way into a two-way communication . Miss Wong . So what 's the fuss about VOD ? It 's just a TV set ! Just listen to her . It will allow you to watch the movie you want just by entering a code . This is nothing new . You can register by phone and then follow the movie time slot . What you 're referring to is limited by the time slot . With VOD , you can watch it whenever you like . It 's two different things . So stop interrupting her , dumbass ! Furthermore , with VOD movies , you can fast forward , pause , and rewind , just like watching it on videotape . Besides movies , you can also surf the net , do grocery shopping or shop for other things online . If combined with the use of a SMART card , you can even transfer your money from your bank . It 's very convenient . You 'd need a big bunch of wires for so many functions . It 's not convenient at all ! A man like you can be so ignorant . All you need is a phone line . I 'm just talking to myself , woman . Mind your own business . Don 't pretend to be an expert . How can a phone line that thin carry so many functions ? Ask the professionals if you don 't believe me ! Actually , this lady is right . The greatest breakthrough of our VOD is that it uses just one single fiber optic line . See ? Even she agrees that you don 't know anything ! - Why , you ... you ... - Elaine , please continue . So uneducated ! Mr. Ken pages us to a meeting in the War Room . War Room ? Is that a place for wars ? Almost . This is where we do our research and analysis . Only a few people have access . You 've met Clarence . This is Kim . He has several doctorate degrees . I can also read your fortune . I 'm good at that . I 'm TC . I used to be in Pathology . But not anymore . Is orange juice OK ? Sun , have you offended anyone lately ? There 'll soon be many . Once we launch our VOD , every telecommunication company will be affected . Such as ? Such as networks , video distributors , and Internet Service Providers . Especially ISP 's . My feelings exactly . If someone wants Mr. Ken dead , I suppose it would be those internet or software development firms . That 's a lot of people ! Not really . Only the top five firms would feel most threatened by Mr. Ken . Teresa , search the net for the list of top level managers from these firms . Sure . It can 't be that serious . VOD is television . It 's different from computers . They 're not that different . TV is family entertainment . But Internet is for one individual . It 's like salt and sugar . Would you substitute salt for sugar ? Besides , there 're bankers , doctors , and chemists among the victims . They may not be just pinpointing me . So ? So what ? If the murderers can kill by spontaneous combustion , then there 's nothing I can do to prevent them from killing me . Why waste your time thinking about this ? Are you that smart ? Sorry . What is it ? Nothing . Let 's eat ! Are you sure you can cook ? Why not ? My specialty is not studying , but making instant noodles . I was one of the " Ten Best Instant Noodles " winners in college . Then you 'll do the cooking from now on . But they withdrew the prize afterwards . They said that I cheated . Let 's get married . You 're nuts . The more reason to get married . Hey , don 't move around . I don 't want to , that 's why I want to get married . Come on . You will regret it ! I won 't know that until after the wedding . Fine ! But first , you have to gain 10 pounds . No problem . I want to spend our honeymoon in Prague . No problem . I 'll book the tickets tomorrow . Also , I 'll only marry a guy who has an Afro hairdo . Like that ? Close . - Forget it then . Let 's continue . - Damn you ! No need to guess . Those are the Prague tickets . I 've gained 3 pounds , and I 've booked the flights . As for the hairdo ... I 've got a sample . The stylist should know what to do ! Do you have any vacation left ? Of course ! That 's right . Senior staff like you have flexible time off . Junior staff like me don 't have such luxuries . That 's right . What should we do ? We 'll have to wait . I 'll return the tickets . Don 't you dare ! How long is the trip ? 2 weeks ? You 've even got a small dock down there . That kills me . That 's really cute . I 've always felt that your house is like a morgue . Metal everywhere . Some wood would help . Roundtrip tickets for two to Prague ? It 's about to expire . Return them ! Why did you leave them here ? Don 't waste them . Don 't touch my stuff . Better get a refund soon . - Might as well use the money on dinner . - Don 't touch my stuff ! Why are you so upset ? She 's been dead for so long . Why hang on to them ? For decoration ? They 're not even pretty ! Why do you care ? Why did you ask me to come here ? What the hell do you need me for ? I 'm useless to you . - Your duty is to protect me . - Are you crazy ? Protect you ? I don 't know jack shit about your Hi-tech , body explosion stuff . I 'm just a cop ! You think I 'm a scientist ? ! Ask those Ml6 guys to protect you then ! I 'm only here to chat with you , man ! You just want to die ! That 's easy . Just bang your head on the wall . No need to wait til you explode ! Why drag me into this ? If you want to die , do it on your own . You should know what I mean . Are you hungry ? I just don 't know what to do with you ! Of course I 'm hungry . I haven 't eaten all day . What would you like ? I 'll bring you to a nice place . Do you trust me ? The vendors are still here . They 'll be gone if you don 't come here often enough . What do you want ? Hurry up with your orders . Combination noodles . Shrimp noodles for me . No onions . Hey ! I know you two ! It took you long enough ! You need new glasses ! Eat some more . Go away ! Get lost ! No , no ... I can 't take your money . - Careful . It 's hot ! - Let 's eat . Wow ! This is really spicy ! I thought you always wanted extra spicy . You can 't take this now ? You could when you were younger ! Hey , I didn 't order sausage ! It 's on the house . Then at least give me more than just two slices . What a miser ! You haven 't changed a bit , especially that big mouth of yours . Did you finish school ? What are you up to now ? Installing antennas . That bad ? No wonder you look so sad . Nobody uses antennas nowadays . Even I don 't use it . Don 't you worry . Those antennas are still big in China and Vietnam . Plenty of chances , young man ! Combination noodles ! Can 't you wait a minute ? Why not tell him how much you really have ? Eat your noodles ! Where were we ? You were lecturing him . Do continue . He 's really depressed . Right . It doesn 't matter what you do , as long as you are happy . Just take a look at my noodle place . Many rich folks come to eat here . Whenever I 'm off , they 'll have to settle for those wonton noodles next door . Those noodles are just plain shit ! Where 's your daughter ? Don 't even talk about her . But you do have a daughter ... I said , don 't even talk about her ! Young people nowadays ... At least you two still remember me . Nostalgia is a good thing ! Don 't look so sad . Your noodles ? My treat ! What about mine ? Of course you have to pay , big mouth ! I have to get back to work . This world stinks more and more by the day . Not as bad as your mouth . Maybe , but it has a sweet taste . Want to try ? That 's it . Smile and you won 't blow up . Motherfucker ! Pay up ! Pay up ! Why won 't you pay up ? None of your business ! Police ! Freeze ! Police ! Stop fighting ! Thanks . What 's with you ? You and that Ml6 dog are always following us . Where is he now ? You think it 's easy to follow you around ? But we are really concerned about Mr. Ken 's safety . Maybe you 're worried about my competence even more . I 'm watching him , but you 're watching me . Do you want me to screw up in front of Ml6 ? But you did screw up , didn 't you ? Try not to protect your image all the time . Yes , Madam . You 're the boss . Madam , you 're here ! Your lab report is already out . Have you got it ? I 've got it . Thanks . What report ? Were you not feeling well ? Hey ... what lab report ? There is no sign of fracture or hemorrhage in your skull . If that 's the case , can I be discharged ? If you stay one more night , we can make sure that there is no future damage to your brain . We 'll arrange to have this patient transferred to another ward . Just stay here and rest . It 's for your protection . But I really want to go home . Please be patient . Get some rest . Hey , you . Got into a fight ? Did it hurt ? No . Did you throw up ? No . Then you should be fine . You can leave . I get hit on the head a lot . My mom said I 'll be fine as long as I don 't throw up . It 's only pain . You 'll be alright . Relax . What 's your name ? My last name is Ken . I asked for your name , not just your last name ! What 's wrong with you ? Sorry . My name is Tit-sun . My name is Brother Chuen . How do you do ? How do you do ? Why did they tie you up ? Isn 't that obvious enough ? I 'm crazy . I bite people . They want to get Chucky . So I bit them . Who 's Chucky ? Chucky is very famous . He barks really loud . All other dogs are scared of him . You look ugly when you laugh . Let me tell you something really funny . My mother lost a bet . She often said that she would live longer than I would . But this time , I won . She went to bed 2 days ago and never woke up . The doctor told me she 's dead . Do you miss her ? Of course . But I can only miss her for a while each day . I 'm really busy , you know . I have to check on those hawkers at the market everyday for fraud . And I have to make sure that cars won 't hit the kids when they cross . I even have to feed Chucky . Damn ! I wonder if Chucky ate breakfast this morning ? Have you got a girlfriend ? Yes , a while ago . There is a nurse here . She 's really pretty . She wears a Mickey Mouse watch . My mom said that I 'm all grown up now . I really would like to start a relationship . What is it then ? Nothing . Then why did you come here for a lab test ? Just for fun ? Come on , tell me about it . X-ray reveals a black spot in my stomach . The doctor suspected cancer , so he took some samples for analysis . What did the report say ? It can 't be cancer . You don 't even smoke or drink ! You should be fine . Don 't be like this . The doctor said that the black spot is only food that 's not digested . He said I should cut down on pickled eggs . You had me all worried ! I apologize , Mr. Ken . We 'll transfer him now . There 's no need . We got along pretty well . That 's right . We 're friends . Your name is Sunny . I forgot my business cards . This is my business card . Call me if you need any help . Why would I need help ? I 'm the one who help others . If anyone bullies you here , just say that you know me . I 'm notorious around here . Thank you so much . You 're too corny . I 'm not talking to you anymore ! Are you transferring me to another room or not ? Right . Let 's go . Sorry , Mr. Ken . Remember . Just tell them that you know me . Sun , did you bump your head ? Does it hurt ? What is it ? Have you seen Adele ? What ? Impossible ! Adele was just here ! - It 's just your delusion . - No ! I even felt her touch . - She was standing right there ! - Alright . You get some sleep . I 'll call the doctor . Lie down . This card was not here before ! Ask the hospital staff if they saw anyone leaving it here . How could this be ? This address is top secret . That 's where Mr. Sato is . Sato ? ! The one who did the Biology I.C. research ? Yes . It was he who told us about Brotherhood Of Technology . He 's under Ml6 's protection . It 's impossible that anyone else would have known this address . Help ! Help ! Madam ! They were never out of this room . And there 's nothing here . What 's the burning smell ? I don 't know . It 's the smell of human flesh ! Did you see Mr. Sato ? He 's gone ! How could he just disappear ? Spontaneous combustion again ? Doesn 't look like it . If it is , the people beside him would still be alive . Well ? Human explosion again ? I 'll take a look . Sam ! - Please let me go , Dr. Ken . - Sorry . Please wait . Ivy , let me do the forensics this time . Kim has already called someone from the Hong Kong University . Dr. Ken , you should follow the rules . James asked us to do the forensics . But James is not here yet . Madam , this will look bad for our department . Do you want the truth or not ? Dr. Yip ! Dr. Wong ! Dr. Lau ! So are you the expert or are we the experts ? Of course you are . You were all my teachers . I 'll give you a report in two days . How about this , Dr. Yip ? Let me check it out first . I 'll let you examine after I 'm done . Then what 's there left for us to examine ? Our objective is to preserve the crime scene 's original state . I taught you that ! Sam , give us a hand . Coming ! According to the first witness and our own observations , the door was locked when the incident happened . There were two corpses in the room . But Mr. Sato had vanished . We found a large sum of cash and his credit cards . Also , the suit which Mr. Sato was last seen wearing was scattered all over the place . But there were no signs of struggle . This proves that the probability of a forced abduction was very low . If he has really left the place , it must be either voluntary , or he must have been unconscious . As for the autopsy report on the two Ml6 members , the cause of death was heart failure . All the other major organs simply failed simultaneously . I 've never done an autopsy on a cooked corpse before . They were microwaved to 80 % % % well done . They smelled like BBQ pork when I cut them open . You don 't have to be that detailed . What else ? Since the bodies were microwaved from the inside , all internal organs were cooked . Therefore , there were no bacteria to determine time of death . - The skin ... - Can you just skip to your conclusion ? Even though I couldn 't find any evidence from the corpses , I could still estimate their time of death to be around 10 to 10 : 07 pm . Without any evidence , how could you be so sure ? I imagined putting a 180lb piece of meat in a huge microwave oven , and calculated the time it takes to cook the meat . As simple as that ! Our satellite also ceased to receive signals for 15 seconds at 10 : 06 : 32 pm . It closely matches the time of death . We 've also checked the oven . Surprisingly , its microwave power exceeded its original design by ten times . How could that be ? I 'd like to know that myself . This doesn 't fit any scientific logic . We found a large amount of ashes and crystallized substances at the scene . From the analysis , they contain 3 elements . They are organic compound , protein , and the third ? Minerals . Are you telling me that the Japanese did not disappear ? Correct ! Theoretically , add 80 % % % of water , and " it " will turn back into a human being . What could 've done this ? Beats me ! If you dehydrate a person , he should only turn into a dry corpse at the most . But now we are seeing an actual , dissolved substance . Just like being shot dead by laser guns in a cartoon . Hey man , I 'm only kidding . He 's referring to Assault Satellites . There are now more than 800 satellites orbiting the earth . We only know the true usage of half of them . The rest are all classified military satellites . My knowledge is that the U.S. government has already tested laser and particle beam from these satellites successfully . It 's not too difficult to check . We can match the time of the incident with the positions of the satellites hovering above Hong Kong at that time . Dr. Yip , I still don 't understand . I 've handled a lot of crime scenes . Normally , when there are multiple bodies in a common crime scene , their cause of death is usually the same . So why did the Japanese dissolve into ashes , but not the other two guys ? One exploded , and the other turned into ashes . What about the other two guys ? James didn 't say anything about their deaths . Actually , even James himself didn 't know . One guy 's Iranian , and the other was Russian . Their cause of death was never announced . Why does killing people have to be this fancy ? Why does killing people have to be this fancy ? Maybe they are experimenting . I think someone is trying to show off . - Mr. Sato might know more . - But he is dead . Our computers have always communicated with his . We can try breaking into his system . A break-in ? That 's illegal ! Do you have a better suggestion ? This is too big for us to handle . Cops ! Cops ! Cops ! Cops , Gator ! Are you Mr. Yao ? CID . What ... These are just games ! No X-rated stuff ! You can arrest me , but please don 't beat me up . We need your help . Sir , please don 't play games with me . How can small potatoes like us help you ? - But you ARE Gator , aren 't you ? - Are you crazy ? Gator my ass ! All I have are dead CPU 's . Uncle , you can stop pretending . I brought them here . You little piece of shit ! You betrayed me ! You 're asking for a beating ! Fine ! You can forget about descrambling all those Japanese porno discs of yours ! You little shit ! Mr. Yao , I urged Kim to bring me here . I 'm Ken Tit-sun . But you are so young ! You 're good ! You did something even the Japanese and Americans couldn 't . Transmitting video with just one single phone line . Smart ! You are truly a smart ass ! I need your help to save my life . Save your life ? This Japanese system is known for its superb firewalls . That 's why we need your help , Uncle . If you can break into his system , you 'll become a legend overnight . Even the Japanese will be running scared when they hear your name . You are running scared now ! You 're always bragging about your hacking skills . You try breaking in then . We have the technology , but we don 't have the expertise like you do . That 's true . I can 't match you when it comes to building things , but when it comes to breaking in ... Hey , wait a minute . This is illegal . You 've always been breaking the law . We only break small laws . We don 't break big ones . I don 't want handcuffs on my wrists . Madam , it 's your turn to speak . Our main objective is to protect Mr. Ken . We 'll turn our backs on anything else . - Right . She saw nothing . - Thanks . I must really learn from Gator this time . I have one condition though . I want a picture with you , so I can hang it on my storefront . Sure . OK . Andy , you handle the hardware . I 'll need 20 terminal linkups , the fastest modems and printers . You need to help me put together a hard disk of at least 20 gigs . Because I don 't know how much memory their system has . You help me copy these 20 hacker programs into the terminals . The rest of you will help me with the cables and monitors , OK ? OK ! - Any questions ? - No . Dismiss ! Done ? All set ! If the correct password is not entered within the first 15 minutes , the firewall will activate immediately . If we try to break in manually , it could take forever . It 's easy because that Japanese was a scientist . Scientists have a logical way of thinking . The same goes for their passwords . Also , check out his surroundings and what he likes . You can 't go wrong . What if his computer randomly chose the password for him ? We have three PCs working on that right now . Wish us luck ! Everyone , on your mark . Set ... Go ! I 'm out of codes ! What 's that ? Something about Japanese baseball . We 've used up their usernames ! Keep entering some more ! The machine just hangs ! Porn stars ? Let me ! There goes my reputation ! Hey , check this out . What is it ? What the hell did you enter ? Don 't know . I just randomly picked a phrase from here . " The final war between good and evil " ? These are all Buddhist scriptures . Nostradamus . What does it mean ? He was a very famous French prophet . He predicted Armageddon . Could this be a prank from Sato ? These are all from the Bible , the Koran , and the Sutra . But they all share the same theme , and that is the religion 's prediction for Armageddon . Buddhism emphasizes the idea of a beginning and an end , that there must be an end before there is a beginning . Sounds like Karma , but also sounds like Armageddon . The Buddhist Sutra reveals that the Great Wheel will turn once every 2,000 years . Each time it turns , Earth will encounter a big disaster . And it 's now 1997 . Aren 't you scared , pal ? In Japan , the Sun Moon God also talks about Armageddon . The gods will descend from the heavens after 3,000 years to destroy not only the world , but also the spiritual world . In the Koran , a large portion is devoted to Armageddon . It even predicts precisely that in July of 1999 , The King Of Horror will descend upon the earth . The Bible 's Book of Revelations said that there are seven signs that precede Armageddon . Maybe it has something to do with our case . The First Sign-the Antichrist will appear in the name of Satan . On that day , the fiery mountains will sink into the oceans . One third of the sea will turn into blood , and one third of the creatures in the sea will die . Even one third of all ships will be destroyed . Some believe that Sadaam Hussein is the Antichrist . And the Persian Gulf War matches the scenarios in Revelations . The Second Sign - A star that burns like a torch will descend from the sky , and fall into 1 / 3 of the world 's rivers . The star is called " Wormwood " . The river will become bitter , and because of that , many will die . " Wormwood " is a kind of herbs , but it 's also known by its nickname , " Chernobyl " . The same name as the Soviet nuclear power plant that suffered a meltdown . The Third Sign-The reappearance of the kingdom of Babylon . The layout of Babylon is very similar to that of modern day Europe . And I 'm sure you all know about the unification talks . The Fourth Sign-The reappearance of the Temple of Jerusalem . Remember Mr. Anderson ? His will stated that 50 billion British pounds under his name will be automatically donated to Jerusalem 's temple restoration efforts . Noah 's Ark will also reappear . As for Mr. Sato , he was dedicated to collecting DNA from each and every living creatures on earth . He didn 't want any of them to become extinct . Then ... It 's just like the Noah 's Ark theory , isn 't it ? The Sixth Sign - There will be a big earthquake . The moon will turn red , and all the stars will fall . The Seventh Sign - " Who does not believe in me will turn to me when the day comes " . On Judgement Day , everything without the seal of God will all be destroyed . Five of the seven signs had already appeared . You can say that Chernobyl and Saddam Hussein are just coincidences . But the rest seems to have been done by man . Could this be the work of some mad scientist , using the Bible as an excuse ? Think so ? Would someone be that dumb as to kill himself by creating Armageddon ? That 's why I said he 's mad . How can we read a madman 's mind ? Are you guys scientists or what ? All this superstitious babbling ! Do you know " Feng Shui " too ? I need it for my home . Sure . Give me your date of birth . There are many things that can 't be explained with science . There 's no point in arguing . I think the answer lies on this card . Although I can 't be sure how this card appears , I am very sure that Adele is dead . So what ? They used a ghost to give me the card . What ? A ghost ? She touched my head with her hand . I could actually feel her body warmth . I tried to catch her , but she simply vanished . Did you actually touch her ? No . But I don 't believe it 's a dream . I don 't think you can feel body warmth in dreams . Mr. Ken , you are a scientist yourself . Do you believe in ghosts ? I don 't know . That 's why I need your help . Besides this incident , have you ever seen Adele in your dreams ? Yes . How many times ? Many . I think it 's just pressure from your work . Steve , don 't give me this work pressure bullshit . Don 't tell me I 'm having illusions because I miss Adele too much . Even if they are , then how do you explain the card ? Do you think I made it up ? I don 't even know how to make up things like that ! Calm down . I can 't help you if you act like this . Rest a bit , please . Well ? I still think that he is mixing reality with his illusions . Have a drink . What does that mean ? Is he losing his mind ? He is just being hyper . Urbanites are a bunch of nervous wrecks . And the card ? How do you explain that ? Even he himself can 't be sure it 's Adele who left the card . The card 's origin and Adele 's appearance are two separate issues . Do you guys really believe that he saw Adele 's ghost ? Tai-pang ... Say it . Don 't come over ! Don 't be scared , you all . Don 't come near me ! I 've got a gun ! It 's me , Tai-pang . Put your gun down . It 's me ! Sun . Watch the door . Ivy ! Be careful . I don 't know WHAT she is ! Why are you here ? I don 't know . I really don 't know . Do you remember the past ? When 's your birthday ? June 20th . And mine ? July 21st . Remember your first words to me ? " You 're so silly ! " Now what ? Does this mean we 're all urban psychos ? Sunny baby , I am Adele . I miss you so much . Did Adele ever call you " Sunny baby " ? This is not your girlfriend . Not her . Fine , you can go . You 're in the wrong body . But I 'm not done . Yes , you are . Your money 's outside . Thanks . We 'll pay you outside . Fine , as long as I get paid . I 've told you this wouldn 't work . You 're wasting money . It 's just a try . Mr. Ken , he 's the spiritual advisor recommended by my friend . This house is really haunted . Hey , Peter . When did you become a psychic ? Wow ! Turns out this house is haunted by cops ! Sorry , Detective Chiu ! I 'm going ! It 's been a long day . You must all be tired . Go home . Come on ! Maybe all these people here scared her off . I 'll find you an even more powerful psychic later . How come the name is changed ? ! She 's been here . Tickets to Prague in 2 days ? Why is my name on it ? I think someone wants us to go to Prague . This is too spooky for me . I 'm not going ! I 'm telling you . You can count me out . Whatever . Don 't you talk to me like that ! I 'm really not going ! How come it 's so cold ? ! My toes are all frozen ! What the hell did I do wrong ? Why am I here in Prague ? I said I wasn 't coming ! Why did you do this to me ? Adele and I thought of getting married here . Therefore , it 's not odd for her to meet me here . You think I haven 't done my research ? I 've checked the travel agency . They said the tickets were booked under your company 's name . Maybe someone in your office is pulling a prank on you . Could it be Janis ? There are so many personnel in my company . Anyone could 've used our name and booked the tickets . I trust Janis more than I trust you . Then why didn 't you ask Janis to come ? ! Do we have to check each and every church here in Prague ? Adele really liked the churches here . Why can 't she pick the tropics or some place warmer ? Why Prague ? Here 's your hot drink . It 's freezing ! Exactly ! What the hell are we here for ? You , maybe . But why me ? She 's not even my girl ! Don 't get mad . After the drink , we 'll start from the first church again . Give it a chance . It shouldn 't be hard to find a Chinese girl here ... You mean a Chinese ghost ! You 'll have better luck at the cemetery ! Cemetery ? ! You 're right . I know ... Now I know why she wants you here . - I 'm just kidding , man . - Come on . I 'm only kidding ! Me and my big mouth ! There 's hardly any ghost here . Can we go now ? Let 's walk some more . How about this ? We 'll wait here till they close the gates . You 're kidding ! I can barely walk . There 's no way I can just stand and wait . Jog on the same spot then . Adele , if you really want to see me , just reveal yourself . Hey ! You can 't take off your hat here . Sorry . Hey ! Watch out ! You almost got run over . Why are you sighing ? It 's gorgeous here . No need to sigh for that . I sigh because I 'm with you . Pretty place like this is for a man and a woman . If only Ivy could be here . Fine . We 'll book our return flight tomorrow . No need . We still have so many places to go . There 's no hurry . Besides , I haven 't tried Table Dance yet . Perhaps Adele likes neither churches nor cemeteries . Maybe she likes Table Dance too ! Let 's take a picture , just to prove that we 've been here . Can you get the geese and the ducks too ? Hurry up . Adele ! - Take your jacket off ! - I 'm doing it ! HURRY ! I 've never bought any women 's clothes before . So don 't yell at me if you don 't like them . You are one hungry ghost ! I haven 't eaten for a long time . Do you remember being hit by a car here ? Yes , but then , it felt like I was asleep , and I even dreamt about you . Do you remember visiting me ? Of course ! You even pointed your gun at me . You chicken shit . Hey , I was scared . You 're a ghost ! I 'm NOT a ghost ! Drink this . It 'll warm you up . You know I don 't drink . Why are you testing me ? But I ... I just cannot accept the fact that you ... You 've been cremated , but now you 're here . Don 't you want to see me ? Of course ! You have a new girlfriend . No , I don 't ! Be honest . Tell me the truth . I can take it . Just tell me ! No , I really don 't . You 're still lying ? ! I can see it in your eyes . Do you have a new girl ? Ask him . You ask him whether I have one . I don 't want to ask him . I 'm asking you ! You better clear this up . Listen to me . - Are you lying ? - I swear ! I swear ! OK ? That 's it ! She 's definitely your girl . Definitely ! Are we really getting married here ? Do you like it ? As long as you won 't regret it . Of course I won 't ! You two are making me sick . Are you scared ? You can go on if you are . I 'm getting goose bumps . Call Ivy and tell her to come too . I 've called her already ! She 's verifying her fingerprints in Hong Kong right now . She 's really the boring workaholic type . Not as boring as a nerd like you ! What is it ? This is too strange . If I tell this to anyone , they 're going to say I 'm crazy . Doesn 't all this seem like a dream to you ? Doesn 't matter . The most important thing is that she 's really back . Right ? Hey , come over here . What 's up ? This is so pretty ! Look ! Where ? I don 't see it . You asked for it ! You 're going to be broke this time . Isn 't this beautiful ? ADELE ! Wait ! Adele ! Calm down ! Are you crazy ? Get back here ! - Just let me go ! - Get up ! Dr. Ken , don 't worry . Adele will be back . The most important thing is that you know she 's real . Adele ? Where is she ? So you 're the one behind everything ? Everything is God 's will . I 'm just his messenger . God ? ! What God ? Besides God , who else can be this powerful ? I give you this ring . Wear it when you 're back in Hong Kong . Can 't move ? I 'm afraid you might get too excited . Go to hell ! You don 't excite me ! I 've always said that foreigners are the craziest of all ! Get him ! Let me kick his ass ! Why take her away from me and shatter my heart ? And in a lapse of time , bid farewell to happiness ? My feeble hands were unable to comfort my broken heart Hard to let go , with only tears in my eyes How did this happen ? How can I solve this mystery ? The burden too heavy , the pain too much A regret that I cannot face Never thought I was that close when I lost my love ... Take a look at this . Some I can name and some I can 't . Cost me a month 's salary . This is powerful shit . You will be safe with this . Besides , I 'm with you . Don 't worry . I 'll go by myself tonight . I didn 't get it . Come again ? I feel a sense of danger here . But I really want to see Adele again , so ... So what ? Are you giving up now ? That Billy Conners is just another con man ! He 's an authority figure in Psychology . He studies ESP . SO ? He 's a high class con man then ! Then how do you explain Adele ? How would I know ? You 're the scientist and you 're asking ME ? ! Because even I can 't explain it myself . Don 't be scared . If he does anything funny , I 'll beat the shit out of him . Don 't you worry . You don 't understand . You really don 't ! You 've got Ivy . You 've never lost your most beloved . I really want to see Adele again . What does that mean ? Call me when you need me , and kick me out when you don 't need me anymore ? ! Who do you think I am ? A call girl ? That 's not what I meant ! Sorry . Am I interrupting ? Of course not . We 're just chatting . Boss , do you want to join our party ? No , I 'm not going . Lots of good food there ! You guys have fun tonight . Alright then . We 're going . Janis . Walk Tai-pang to the door for me . Tai-pang ! Merry Christmas . I 'll wish you a Merry Christmas if I still see you tomorrow . Ken . I said I 'm not going . Have fun tonight . I 'm not talking about that party . Welcome to our party . Come on . He 's here . - Hi , Clarence . - Hello ! Ken , welcome . Johnny ? ! Surprised ? There are lots of familiar faces here . Hello , Ken ! We knew you 'd join us sooner or later . Welcome . Where 's Adele ? She 's fine . Don 't you worry . Let the ceremony begins . Drink this , Dr. Ken . I don 't understand . You still don 't ? I 've told you . I 'm here to welcome you . Is murder part of your welcome too ? They died to prove God 's power . So you admit to killing all those people ? That 's all I need . POLICE ! Freeze ! Freeze ! You know how excited I am . Chuck , bring him here . Watch out for his tricks . Tai-pang , where 's your " stick " ? One of them must work ! Tell me . Where 's Adele ? Why ? Why don 't you believe me ? - It is God 's will ... It is God 's will ... - Tell me . Tell me where Adele is ! You tell me where she is ! Why didn 't you believe him ? He cured my terminal cancer in just one day . Hey , wait . Thanks . What ? Are you afraid he 's not dead ? Maybe he 'll resurrect . Did you regret it ? Not at all . He 's a con man and a killer . But he 's known to perform miracles . Where 's Tit-sun ? He wants to sit around longer . Marry me ? Don 't be silly . You never know what will happen tomorrow . Why ? Why can 't I accept anything beyond science ? Is it because I 'm too smart , or just plain ignorant ? Stop the car ! Tell them to go back ! Call the ambulance ! What 's that ? If you believe me , I will not disappoint you . I 'll have a surprise for you . Your friend is a real pain in the butt . Why do you care so much about life and death ? Tai-pang ! Get out of here ! Actually , they 're no big deal . Are you nuts ? ARE YOU ? So you like killing ? KILL ME THEN ! KILL ME ! Pain all over ! So that 's how it feels to have a hole in your chest ! Sun , it is so clear to me now . The brothers and sisters in this group are all carefully chosen by Him to assist you . What exactly are you trying to say ? You won 't understand . He gives you a quota to select a group of people and accomplish the last mission . Last mission ? ! Yeah ! What is it ? Armageddon ! The moon turning red and the earthquakes ... All the signs have appeared . There 's only one sign left now . Once a non-believer like you starts to have faith , then it 's done ! It 's easy for geniuses like you to create Armageddon . How many do I need to choose ? 1,500 . You 're saying that only 1,500 people will survive Armageddon ? ! Doesn 't matter ! It 's the end of the world ! What 's the difference between life and death ? You and the remaining 1,500 people will turn into gods and recreate a perfect world . By then , the new world will have no war , no starvation , no disease , not even triads . Everybody just sings Karaoke everyday . Isn 't that wonderful ? And you , you 'll be our leader . Isn 't it cool ? I can choose whomever I want ? Of course ! You 're His son , and I 'm your buddy . Remember to save me a spot , OK ? Just say the word , and lvy will resurrect , just like Adele . Why are you so clear minded all of a sudden ? How could you understand the whole picture ? It 's a miracle ! Even now , you still don 't believe in Him ? I 'm not saying that I don 't believe in Him , but ... It 's the truth ! Haven 't you heard of the truth ? Then , is the truth right or wrong ? You ... you still have to ask this ? Survival of the fittest is the law of nature , and that 's also the truth . Is that right or wrong ? You said that , out of millions of people , only 1,500 will survive Armageddon . Do you think that 's right ? But they deserve to die ! Look what they 've done to the world ! All that pollution ! Even if you don 't create Armageddon , the world will end sooner or later ! If He really wants them to change , why can 't He just come out and say it ? I guarantee that they will believe Him and change ... So what 's your point ? You 're not Tai-pang . He wouldn 't ask me like that . He knows I won 't do it . Why can 't you understand ? This is already predestined . The world can change for the better . Just like you can change into Tai-pang , right ? You 'll lose Adele . I was dead already . We haven 't lost anything . Besides , it 's almost the end of the world . No point for me to come back . Someone will do this ! Even if you don 't , someone else will ! Find someone else then . I don 't want to be another Judas . You will both go to Hell ! Go to Hell ? It 's already Armageddon . What 's so scary about Hell ? We 'll go together . Fool ! You 're such a fool ! God ! Please execute your last judgement ! Pain all over ! So that 's how it feels to have a hole in your chest ! Damn ! Why did you hit me so hard ? ! Are you Tai-pang ? Who else could I be ? Your dad ? It 's like a nightmare ! Good . Now everything is ... Don 't come near . It 's alright now . How do you know ? I 'm already dead . What if I vanish again ? Don 't come any closer ! I 'm afraid I 'll vanish again . Promise me ... Promise me you won 't miss me anymore ? Adele , I ... Just stay there and listen ! There may not be another chance . If I do disappear , promise me you 'll live a good life . I don 't want to see you sad . You only live once . I was already dead . I 've already earned my extra time by seeing you again . No , you won 't . You won 't vanish again . Listen to me ... That 's what we thought when we were in Prague . Just promise that you won 't miss me . I know I won 't miss you ! I think I 'll go to heaven or get reincarnated . I promise you . I 'll live well . I 'll go out , and I 'll date other girls , alright ? But I won 't let you cook instant noodles for your new girlfriends . I 'm really afraid I 'll vanish again ! No , you won 't . I 'll never leave you . No man is that devoted . Sure there is . I 'm proud to present the most devoted husband , Ken Tit-sun . You 're bad ! Ivy ! Lvy ! I 'm here ! I thought it was Armageddon ? How come you get to have all the fun ? I think if we had accepted his mission , then that would 've been the end of the world . So it was a test ? What kind of a naughty god is that ? He didn 't say . But I guess they 're all the same . Anyway , just don 't do anything that would hurt other people . Does marrying Ivy count as hurting others ? I better reconsider . Forget it . You 're going to hell for sure ! Yeah right ! If I can choose , I 'll definitely choose Armageddon . Fine , fine . I 've told you . Everything would be alright . You 're so brave ! Really ? My mom said that about me all the time ! " The Health Department is stunned that Christmas was the first day in Hong Kong history where there were no deaths . They believe it was a miracle that the 4 critically injured survive . As for the strange lightshow at the Hong Kong Stadium , the government is at a loss for explanation ... "

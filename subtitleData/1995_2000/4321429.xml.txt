 Please state the nature of the medical emergency . Hello ? Computer , who activated the emergency medical holographic program ? Auto-initiation of the EMH program occurred when a shipwide Red Alert was initiated . Emergency ? Sick Bay to Bridge . Captain Janeway , please respond . Captain Janeway is not on board the ship . Well , then , who 's in command ? Internal scans indicate no crew members are on board . You mean , the ship 's empty ? Affirmative . What is the crew 's current location ? Unknown . Did they go on shore leave ? Are they dead ? What ? That information is not available . Can you give me a ship 's status report ? Affirmative . Warp core is off-line . The ship is restricted to emergency power and auxiliary systems only . Structural integrity breach on Deck 6 , Deck 7 and Deck 12 . Deflector shields inoperative . Weapons array off-line . Communications off-line . Sewage and waste reclamation ... All right , I get the idea . What caused this damage ? That information is not available . Of course it isn 't . Computer , transfer all Bridge logs to this station . Accessing Bridge logs . Replay last log entry . Heavy casualties ... the warp core 's going critical and the ejection system is off-line . I 've ordered all personnel to abandon ship . Lieutenant Torres and I ... Computer , have any escape pods been ejected ? All escape pods were launched at 2100 hours . Scan the ship for any humanoid life-forms . There are no humanoid life-forms aboard this vessel . Well , I 'm glad everyone bothered to say good-bye . Chief Medical Officer 's Log , Stardate 48892.1 . It appears that Voyager has suffered a ... disaster . What kind I don 't know , but one thing is clear . The crew was forced to abandon ship . It would therefore seem that my usefulness has come to an end . I am terminating my program . If anyone finds this Log , I can be reactivated by ... Hello ? ! Hello ? ! Doctor ! What are you doing ? ! Sorry. I wasn 't expecting a member of the crew . The computer said everyone had left . The internal sensors were damaged during the attack . They must not be reading every life sign on the ship . Attack ? The Kazon . Two of their Predator-class warships took us by surprise , hit us with a volley of plasma torpedoes . It started a core breach , and we had to abandon ship . The Captain and I stayed behind to see if we could stop the breach . At the last second , we did . Why didn 't the crew return to the ship ? Because they couldn 't . The Kazon tractored all the life pods onto their ships . They went into warp before we could stop them . What 's wrong ? This tricorder isn 't registering your life signs . This one isn 't working either . You 've got to help the Captain . She was hit by a falling support beam . I didn 't want to risk moving her , so I had to leave her on the Bridge . Can 't we beam her to Sick Bay ? The transporters are down , so are the turbolifts . I had to crawl through 31 Jefferies tubes on five decks just to get here . Then you 're going to have to go back up there with a medical kit . I 'll instruct you on how to ... You don 't understand , Doctor . I 'm not going- - you are . I 'm sending you to the Bridge . That would be ideal if it were possible , but my projection system is limited to the Sick Bay and the holodecks . Not anymore . For the past few weeks , we 've been setting up holographic emitters on critical decks . We were hoping to set up a remote holo-projection system , give you access to other parts of the ship . Why wasn 't I told about this ? We hadn 't even tested the system yet . There was no guarantee it was going to work . I guess the Captain didn 't want to get your hopes up . Her compassion is heartwarming . The next time , I 'd rather be kept informed . Where are these remote projectors ? Decks 1 through 5 . We also put them in Engineering , the Mess Hall and the Cargo Bay . All the projectors are in place , but the problem is , we 're going to have to interface with the Sick Bay imaging system . That 's going to take a lot of power and computer memory . I don 't know if we have enough reserve power to spare . Most of the crew is gone . Could we divert power from life support systems ? Good idea . I can drop life support down to minimum levels on the lower decks . That should give us enough power . All right , I 'll need another 20 minutes to get the projectors on line . All right . The remote projectors are charged and ready to go . Imaging interface ... stable . Are you ready to try this ? I assume there 's still an emergency medical kit behind the Tactical console ? That 's right . Then I 'm ready . There are a couple of things you should know . In order to do this , I had to recalibrate your containment field , so your holo-matrix will be very sensitive to disruption . Try to stay away from energy discharges- - phaser fire , force fields , that sort of thing . - l 'll try . - Make sure you do , because , if your containment field collapses , it 'll take hours to reinitialize your program . Understood . I 'm going to head down to Engineering and try to get some of the critical systems working . You 'll hear from me when I get the com system back on line . Unless , of course , this doesn 't work , in which case , I 'll see you in about five seconds . Good luck , Doctor . Thank you . I have a feeling I 'll need it . Well ... it 's bigger than I thought . Captain ? Hello , Captain . You 're going to be fine . Oh , Doctor . I see the new holo-projectors are working . Lieutenant Torres was able to get them on line . Are you feeling any pain , dizziness , nausea ? I 'm a little disoriented and I have one hell of a headache . For some reason , none of the tricorders are working , but , from what I can tell , you have a concussion . I 'd like to get you to Sick Bay as soon as possible . The last thing I remember is launching the escape pods . Lieutenant Torres and I were trying to stop the core breach , and then I blacked out . You were successful in preventing the breach . And the crew ? They were taken prisoner by the Kazon . Torres to Bridge . Can you hear me ? Yes , Lieutenant , we hear you . Go ahead . Are you all right , Captain ? Fine. I 'm glad you convinced the Doctor to make a house call . What 's our status ? I 've got communications back on line , and I think I can reactivate the warp core , but it 'll mean recrystallizing the entire dilithium matrix . Keep on it . In the meantime , I 'll see if I can restore the Bridge controls and start scanning for the Kazon ships . Aye , Captain . Torres out . Doctor , do you know anything about bypassing a power relay ? is it anything like a coronary bypass ? Actually , it is . Give me a hand . See this conduit ? It 's a power relay . Its circuits are burnt out . What we need to do is reconfigure ... Neelix to Bridge . is anyone there ? Emergency . Neelix , this is the Captain . What 's wrong ? Help , I need help ! I 'm in the Mess Hall . There 's a ... Neelix , are you there ? Neelix ! With the turbolifts down , it 'll take me a half hour to get there . Doctor ... it 's up to you . I 'll use the remote projectors to send you to the Mess Hall . Stand by for transfer . I hope that crushed your skull , Kazon pus hog ! Kazon ? What 's it like to stare death in the face , Kazon ? Missed me . I suggest you surrender now , Kazon ! The Captain 's on her way . Gut spore ! You needle snake ! My best saut√© pan . Good work , Doctor . You 're injured . What 's wrong ? is it serious ? Don 't panic , Mr. Neelix . It looks superficial . Am I going to die ? Not unless you 're allergic to tomatoes . That isn 't blood . It 's some kind of sauce . Nondoran tomato paste . Ooh ! That 'll leave a nasty stain . What are you doing here , Doctor ? I could ask you the same thing . Kes and I were on our way to the escape pod when this Kazon fungus came crawling out an access hatch . I kept him occupied long enough for Kes to get away , but he didn 't give up so easily . So I took off running , he chased me , and I led him here . No one gets the best of me in my kitchen ! I 'm fine now . The question is , are you ? Me ? You 're bleeding . Bleeding ? That 's impossible . Don 't panic , Doctor . It looks superficial . I 'm not programmed to bleed . Maybe you should check your program . Emergency Medical Hologram to Captain Janeway . Go ahead , Doctor . Captain , we 've captured a Kazon . He 's been rendered unconscious and Mr. Neelix is fine . But I believe my program is malfunctioning . I request that you return me to Sick Bay immediately . Acknowledged . Mr. Neelix , keep an eye on the Kazon until I get there . I 'm on my way . No problem , Captain . Pain ? I 'm not programmed to feel pain . Heart rate ? Blood pressure ? Brain patterns ? Computer , analyze emergency medical holographic program . Has it been altered in any way to include ... life signs ? Unable to comply . Requested program is not on file . Not on file ? The program 's running right now . Display schematics for all Sick Bay holographic systems . No holographic systems exist in Sick Bay . EMH Program AK-1 Diagnostic and Surgical Subroutine Omega 323 . Check the database and you 'll find it . Specified program does not exist . Well , then , who is the Chief Medical Officer on board this ship ? The Chief Medical Officer of USS Voyager is Dr. Lewis Zimmerman . Lewis Zimmerman ? Yes . He was the engineer who created my program . I understand he resembles me , but he 's not on Voyager . He 's at the Jupiter Station Holo-programming Center . Computer , how long has Doctor Zimmerman served on Voyager ? . Dr. Zimmerman commenced duty on stardate 48308.2 . 48308 ... That 's the date I was activated . Computer , display all Starfleet records on Dr. Lewis Zimmerman . He looks a lot like me . In fact , he looks exactly like me . Computer , is this me ? Affirmative . Dr. Lewis Zimmerman . Doctor , we 've almost got the warp core back on line , but we need to know where the crew was taken . I want you to perform an ARA scan on the Kazon while we question him . is something wrong ? Something 's very wrong . These tricorders aren 't picking up any of your life signs . At first , I thought they were malfunctioning , but now I find they show me to be a living , breathing , bleeding human being . What ? And that 's not all . According to the computer , I 'm not a hologram . I 'm a real person named " Zimmerman . " I 've been trying to analyze my program , but the computer says it doesn 't exist . This could be a problem with the remote projectors . The multiple holographic signals may be confusing the computer . I 'm going to deactivate you and then reinitialize your program parameters . Computer , discontinue emergency medical holographic system . See what I mean ? You 're right . Your program 's not anywhere on file . Computer , shut down all holographic systems throughout the ship . Computer , what happened to Captain Janeway Lieutenant Torres , Mr. Neelix and the Kazon ? All holographic simulations were discontinued . Simulations ? Computer , I 'm talking about real people . Locate Captain Janeway . Captain Janeway is stored in memory block 47-alpha . List all other programs stored in that memory block . This is the entire Voyager crew . Computer , are you saying that the crew is nothing more than a collection of holographic programs ? Affirmative . This is ridiculous . There must be something wrong . Doctor , am I glad to see you . Can you see me ? Of course I can see you . Who are you ? Sir , it-it 's me . It 's Lieutenant Barclay . Reg ... your assistant . My assistant 's name is Kes . Who are you ? Uh-oh . What ? Oh , no . This is bad . This is ... this is very bad . Don 't panic . Uh ... let 's just try to think our way through this . I 'm not familiar with you . Are you a member of the Voyager crew , or have we encountered another Federation ship ? Oh , boy ! The Voyager . Oh , boy ! This is going to sound a little crazy from your perspective , but you 've got to trust me . None of this is happening . This is all a holographic simulation that you 've been running . What are you talking about ? You 're in the holodeck at the Jupiter Station . Your name is Dr. Lewis Zimmerman . You 're a holo-engineer and you 've been running a program that 's malfunctioning and we 've been trying to reach you . What are you saying- - that I 'm a ... real person ? Well , I always used to think of you that way and l-l know your wife tends to think ... My wife ? We 'd , uh ... we 'd better take this one step at a time . Please do . Well , uh , you see , this , uh , starship- - it 's not really a starship . It was a program that you wrote to study the psychological impact of long-term isolation on a crew made up of Starfleet and Maquis crew members . A program I wrote ? That 's preposterous . I 'm the program . Voyager is a real ship , manned by real people . I 'm afraid not . This must have something to do with the radiation surge . What was that ? Well , we 've been having problems shutting the program down because of a kinoplasmic radiation surge on the station . It 's affected all of the computer systems- - including the holodecks . The radiation must be affecting the memory centers of your brain . How did you get in here ? Oh , I 'm not really here . Clearly , I 'm here because we 're talking . You see , what I mean is , I 'm in a control booth outside of the holodeck . What you see is a projection of my body , so that we can communicate . We 've been trying to get in here or send a com signal in for nearly six hours . You expect me to believe that the past six months I 've spent on this ship have been nothing but a simulation ? You haven 't been here six months . You 've only been here six hours . That 's impossible . I have very clear memories of my first appearance on Voyager , meeting Captain Janeway for the first time- - l 've had numerous experiences aboard this ship . That 's all part of the simulation . How do I know you 're not some type of alien impersonating a Starfleet officer ? Look , Doctor , it 's very important that you believe me . You 're losing your sense of identity . You 're starting to think that you 're part of the program and that 's ... that 's not good . It 's called HTDS- - holo-transference dementia syndrome . So now I 'm having a psychotic episode . No . Yes ! I mean , maybe the radiation ... Doctor , I 'm sorry I have to do this . How dare you ? It hurt , right ? If you were a program , it wouldn 't hurt . l-l could be programmed to think it hurt . Doctor ! I 'll be back . I 've got to discuss this with the others . Don 't ... don 't go anywhere . Pain . Pain . Why would I have pain ? I think I 'm hungry . I 'm not sure what for , but I 'm definitely hungry . This is impossible . The problem is worse than we thought . The , uh , radiation is disrupting the command protocol , so we can 't shut the program down and while the program is running , we can 't access the holodeck grid . Why don 't you beam me out of here ? We tried , but the radiation is interfering with the transporters and we can 't get a lock on you . I 've consulted with our neurologist , Dr. Kaplan , and he said that if we can 't get you out of here within the next hour , that the radiation would completely oxidize your neuro-cellular structures . So , what do you suggest ? There 's only one way left to terminate the program and that 's to play it out . Bring it to its conclusion , and once the simulation ends , it 'll release the access locks on the holodeck arch , and we can get you out of here . How does it conclude ? You programmed two possible outcomes- - either Voyager finds its way back to Federation space or it 's destroyed in the process . But the simulation was designed to run for weeks before either happens . But I know of a way that you can bring it to an end right now . Destroy the ship . Destroy the ship ? Destroy Voyager ? . This is just a simulation , Lewis . None of this is real and unless you destroy this ship that you think you 're on , you 're going to die . No . No , absolutely not . Doctor , it 's the only way . First of all , I don 't even know how to destroy the ship . Second of all , I wouldn 't do it even if I could . And third , how do I know you 're not an alien intruder trying to trick me into killing everyone ? Well ... those are good questions . First , I can tell you how to destroy the Voyager . Second , if you don 't do it , you 're going to die . And third ... well , I 'm just not an alien and I don 't know how else to convince you of that . If what you 're saying is true , why don 't you destroy the ship ? Why do I have to do it ? You 're the one running the simulation . It 's coded to respond to your input , not mine . I 'm sorry , Mr. Barclay- - if that 's what your name really is- - but you 're not very convincing . Here . Use this tricorder . Scan the room out to a distance of 15 meters . This appears to show a wall 15 meters away and it does have a holodeck grid configuration . You see ? But you could be manipulating these readings . Scan me ! You 'll see I 'm a holographic projection originating from beyond that wall . Yes . All right . But it could still be an elaborate deception . I can 't take that risk . There has to be some way to convince you . Oh , I know . I 'll be right back . Orderly ! Here . Are you the Emergency Medical Hologram ? Yes , of course I am . Well , we 've got wounded here . I 've seen this patient before . He has multiple percussive injuries . Tricorder . Medical tricorder . I 've been in this moment in time before . What ? What are you talking about ? Help this man . Have we just been catapulted across the galaxy to an unknown area of the Delta Quadrant ? - Yes . - And you are developing tumorous growths on your chest . - What ? - Ah , so ... that hasn 't happened yet . is this stardate 48308 ? Look , are you going to help this man or not ? I 'm not . Mr. Barclay . The program must be malfunctioning . Let me see if I can reset the holographic projector . Mr. Barclay , will you please return ? Now do you believe me ? This is the beginning of the simulation . We can 't shut down the program , but we can restart it . This is my first memory of being activated on Voyager . Who the hell are you ? ! Did I program Mr. Paris to be so annoying ? Actually , I programmed him . I modeled him after my cousin Frank . Hmm ... Computer , delete Paris . What are you ... ? What did you do to him ? Computer , delete Kim . Hmm . Are you convinced yet ? Let 's just say that your credibility level is rising , but I 'm still not prepared to destroy Voyager . So what are you going to do now ? I need to confirm my true nature- - whether or not I am in fact a real person . Let 's just say that I 'm right and this is a real ship , and I 'm a hologram . If I were to destroy the holographic memory core , then I should disappear . Yes , but if you destroy it and you 're still here ... Then I 'm not a hologram . And you 'll know that I 'm telling you the truth . And you 'll know that I 'm telling you the truth . The holo-memory core is located in Engineering . Let 's go . What 's wrong ? The remote holo-projectors were taken off line . I shouldn 't be able to exist outside Sick Bay . That 's because you 're a ... A real person . Yes . I 'm getting the idea . Magnetic constrictors are on line . The warp core is stable . Let 's get started on those plasma relays . You- - who are you ? I 'm the Emergency Medical Hologram . I didn 't know you could be projected into Engineering . I can 't , but it 's a long story . I 'd rather not get into it right now . Fine . We have three wounded crew members over here . I 'm afraid I have a more pressing matter to attend to , Captain . What do you mean , you have a more pressing matter to attend to ? And who are you ? I don 't recognize you . Oh , don 't mind me . I 'm just assisting the Doctor . Doctor , I am ordering you to take care of these wounded crew members . Computer , delete Janeway . The program 's not responding to vocal commands . The protocols are starting to freeze up . We don 't have much time . Jarvis , Parsons , put these men under arrest . Don 't worry . Those phasers aren 't real . They 're just holograms . I wouldn 't be so sure . I was injured earlier . That means the holodeck safeties are off . Now just a moment . Let 's not do anything hasty . Who are you ? Are you two responsible for bringing us here ? Actually , no . The Array you discovered is controlled by an entity you will come to know as the Caretaker or banjo-man . He 's actually an alien life-form who is caring for a species known as the Ocampa , who live nearby . Enough . I don 't know what this is all about , but clearly , you 're involved . Take them to the brig . I 'll question them later . Mm , no , I don 't think so . You 're in no position to argue . I 'm not arguing . I 'm simply pointing out that in several seconds , the entire crew of Voyager will be transported to the Array , where you will be tortured and probed for medical information . It will be quite painful , but not fatal . Bridge to Janeway . We 're being scanned by the Array , Captain . It 's penetrated our shields . What kind of scan ? Bridge ? Janeway to Bridge . Respond . What are you ... ? Time is running out , Doctor . The oxidation levels in your neural tissues are rising . You 've got to destroy this ship and bring this program to an end . First things first . I have to make absolutely sure what I am . This is the central memory nexus for all holographic systems on board . If I destroy this , there won 't be a single hologram left on Voyager . Well , except for me . I 'm being projected from outside the simulation . Go ahead . Give it a try . Convinced ? Computer , what is the status of the holographic imaging system on Voyager ? . The holographic imaging system has been destroyed . Are there any holographic programs running anywhere on the ship ? Negative . Then why is the ship still here and not a holo-grid ? Please restate the question . You said all holo-systems were destroyed . Why is the ship simulation still running ? ! All holo-simulations have been terminated . Doctor , l-l know this is a little confusing , but try to remember that you just destroyed the holographic imaging system on a holographic ship- - a hologram in a hologram . If you want to bring this to an end , you 've got to destroy the entire simulation- - the ship itself . Then it 's true . I am ... a real person . And you 're a person in great danger . Destroy the ship now , before it 's too late . But if I 'm wrong ... Doctor , you 've got to believe me . What else can I do to prove it to you ? I know , I know , but it 's just so ... There . You see what 's happening ? Holograms don 't feel pain . Your brain is being flooded with kinoplasmic radiation . You 're dying . I ... I guess you 're right . Oh ... ! What should I do ? The warp core . Even set on full power , it 's going to take a sustained phaser burst to punch through the outer duranium shielding . Set your phaser to maximum . Aim for the magnetic constrictors . Ready ? Ready . Stop ! Doctor , don 't listen to him . He 's lying . Step away from the warp core , Doctor . Don 't do anything that man tells you . You 're in danger if you do . None of this is real . So I 've been told . It 's all a holographic simulation . That 's right , but it 's not the simulation you think it is . Everything around you is part of a holographic projection that 's being created by your program . My program ? You 're on the holodeck on Voyager . The Captain suggested you take a day off , try a holonovel , so you did . But while you were running the holonovel , there was a kinoplasmic radiation surge in the imaging system . It created a feedback loop between the holodeck computer and your program . All of this , including Mr. Barclay , is a holographic simulation generated by your codes , subroutines and memory circuits . Don 't be distracted by these holographic characters . Stay focused on what you need to do- - destroy the warp core . Wait a minute . The entire crew of Voyager was just taken by the Array . They won 't be back for three days . So what 's he doing here ? The program is malfunctioning . Are you the real Commander Chakotay or a holographic projection like Mr. Barclay ? I 'm a projection . I 'm really at the holographic control station in Engineering . You 're trapped on the holodeck . We 've been monitoring the program from here and we 've been trying to reach you for hours . Sounds familiar . He told me the same thing . Doctor , do you remember coming into the holodeck and running a holonovel within the last six hours ? No . No , I don 't . That 's because your memory circuits are being eradicated by the feedback loop . We have to get you off the holodeck . Transfer you back to Sick Bay . You don 't have memory circuits . You have a mind , and it 's being damaged . Destroy the Voyager , the program will end and we can get you off the holodeck . That 's not true , Doctor . Because of the feedback loop , if you destroy the simulation , you will be destroyed as well . Me ? If you shut down this simulation , your program will be wiped out right along with it . There 'll be no way to retrieve the lost data . You 'll be gone . Oh ... Only real people experience pain . You 've got to believe me . What you 're perceiving as pain is really the feedback loop eradicating your memory circuits . What ... what is it you want me to do ? Don 't do anything . We 're working on the problem right now . We 're close to a solution . Do nothing and you 'll die . Doctor ... trust me . Trust me , Lewis . Kes ? Yes , you know me . You remember me . Yes . You 're my assistant . I told you . His brain is being damaged . He 's losing his memory . This is Kes Zimmerman , your wife . This is all a holographic delusion drawn from people and experiences in your own memory circuits . You are malfunctioning . Lewis , please , listen to Reg . He 's trying to help you . Destroy this program . If you listen to her , you 'll end up destroying yourself . Believe in yourself . You 're not a program . You 're a real , flesh-and-blood human being ... and you 're my husband . I don 't want to lose you . Lewis ... how would you rather think of yourself- - as a real person with a real life with a family that loves you , or as some hologram that exists in a Sick Bay on a starship lost in deep space ? This isn 't about what you want . This is about what you are . Just because you 're made of projected light and energy doesn 't mean you 're any less real than someone made of flesh and blood . It doesn 't matter what you 're made of . What matters is who you are . You 're our friend . And we want you back . Lewis , please . Pick up the phaser . Destroy the warp core . It 's your only hope . Doctor ... we 're close to getting you out of here . Try to hold on . Whatever happens , I just want you to know I love you . I ... I always wanted to tell you , Kes ... that you 're beautiful . Thank you . What 's going on ? We were able to shut down the holodeck simulation that your program was generating . Commander Chakotay transferred you back to Sick Bay . You seem to have suffered no damage . What really happened ? Voyager encountered a subspace anomaly , which created a kinoplasmic radiation surge throughout most of our computers . Unfortunately , it happened while you were using the holodeck . We 've been working for the past six hours to get you out of there . So , there was never a Kazon attack . That 's right . And the crew didn 't really abandon ship . No. ln fact , except for the computer problems , it has been an uneventful day . And who is this Lieutenant Barclay I imagined ? Barclay was part of the original engineering team that designed your program . He was in charge of testing your interpersonal skills . Oh . This should make an interesting paper . Chakotay to Sick Bay . is the Doctor all right ? Yes , Commander . His program is functioning normally . Good work . As soon as you 're finished there , I want all senior officers to report to the Bridge . Acknowledged . It 's good to have you back , Doctor . Well ... I suppose I should begin cataloguing the niotrinate samples I was working on this morning . So you really think I 'm beautiful . I was under a great deal of stress , you understand . I may have said things that are not necessarily my true feelings . Oh . Then you don 't think I 'm beautiful . I didn 't say that , exactly . I ... I consider you very ... very attractive ... in a platonic sense . I see . Then you don 't really love me ? I 'm afraid not . Then I guess our marriage is over . Our marriage ? Are you making a joke ? It isn 't a joke to me , Lewis . I know we have problems , but I think we can solve them . No . No ... this-this can 't be right . Something 's wrong here . It 's not too late , Lewis . You can still save yourself by destroying the warp core . No ... No , I don 't believe you . None of this is real- - it 's all a delusion . Somebody help me ! I am helping you . Listen to him , Lewis . No ! Doctor , are you listening to me ? ! That man needs help ! Try to calm down , Doctor . Everything 's going to be fine . Doctor ? Do you know who I am ? Do you know where you are ? I appear to be on the holodeck grid . That 's right . And do you know what you are ? Yes. I 'm ... I 'm the emergency medical holographic program . Right ? Right . Well , I assume everything that 's happened took place here on the holodeck ? That 's right . We encountered a subspace anomaly and there was a radiation surge in the computer system . And Kes is my assistant ... not my wife ? Your wife ? Never mind . Captain , if it 's okay , I 'd like to return to Sick Bay now . Of course . It 's good to have you back , Doctor . It 's good to be back . Computer , transfer EMH program to Sick Bay . We were married ? It was a delusion , of course . I understand ... but I 'd still prefer it if you didn 't tell Neelix about this . He tends to get a little jealous . It 'll be our secret . I am curious about one thing . What 's that ? The radiation surge caused my program to malfunction and my codes and circuits began to degrade , and yet , instead of detecting that threat to my program , I experienced an elaborate delusion concerning the nature of my existence- - human or hologram . Person ... or projection . Why ? Why would my program focus on such an esoteric dilemma ? Well ... I sometimes ask those kind of questions . Who am I ? What am I doing here ? What 's my purpose in life ? Doesn 't everybody ? Not me . I know exactly who I am and what my purpose is . I am the Emergency Medical Hologram aboard the Starship Voyager . Are you sure about that ? Hmm .

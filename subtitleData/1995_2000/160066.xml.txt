 Lochley : I NEED SPECIFICS , LIEUTENANT CARR . YOUR SAYING YOU 'VE GOT IT COVERED ISN 'T ENOUGH . IT 'S ENOUGH , CAPTAIN , IF I REALLY DO HAVE IT COVERED . DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ISN 'T YOUR JOB , LIEUTENANT , IT 'S MINE . YOU PRESENT ME WITH THE FACTS ; I DRAW THE CONCLUSIONS . A FACT IS THE NUMBER OF COPS WE HAVE AND THE HOURS OF THEIR SHIFTS . EXCUSE ME . A FACT IS THE PROPORTION OF OFFICERS TO THE NUMBER OF CONFERENCE ATTENDEES . NOW , YOU GIVE ME THESE FACTS , AND I DRAW THE CONCLUSIONS AS TO OUR MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS . I HATE TO INTERRUPT , BUT I- - THEN DON 'T ! YOU WANT TO TALK FACTS ? GREAT . FACT--I 'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE HERE ON MARS . FACT--YOU ARE ONLY ON TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT AS OVERSEER OF THE CONFERENCE ON THE DRY PLANET . FACT--MARS IS NOT A COLONY ANYMORE . WE 'RE INDEPENDENT . SO FRANKLY , EARTHFORCE , EARTH , AND YOU CAN KISS MY ASS ! WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ? JUST A DUMB COP , BUT I KNOW THIS PLACE INSIDE OUT .

I 'M CAPTAIN ELIZABETH LOCHLEY- - IN CHARGE OF THE CONFERENCE , NORMALLY STATIONED ON B-5 . YES , I KNOW . SORRY ABOUT COPPING AN ATTITUDE BEFORE . I GUESS I HAVE BEEN BARKING A LITTLE TODAY . IT 'S OK . I CAME TO DO A LITTLE WOOFING ON MY OWN . I 'VE GOT DR. SARAH CHAMBERS UP ON THEEXCALIBUR PREPARING HER KEYNOTE SPEECH , AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT SECURITY MEASURES ARE GOING TO BE AIRTIGHT . IT DOESN 'T HELP ANYONE TO GET CAUGHT UP IN TERRITORIAL SQUABBLES , WITH ALL DUE RESPECT . ARE YOU DONE ? NOT QUITE . LOOK , I HOPE SOME GOOD COMES OUT OF THIS CONFERENCE , SAME AS YOU , BUT MEANWHILE THIS LITTLE EXERCISE MAINLY PUTS A COLLECTION OF EASY TARGETS ALL IN ONE PLACE FOR ANY NUT WITH AN AGENDA . NOW , I 'D RATHER BE OUT SEARCHING FOR A CURE THAN TALKING ABOUT ONE . BUT INSTEAD , WE 'RE HERE , AS ORDERED . AND DON 'T THINK I DON 'T APPRECIATE IT , BUT LET 'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT , CAPTAIN . ALTHOUGH ADMITTEDLY YOU CAME IN AT A BAD MOMENT , I 'VE NO INTEREST IN TERRITORIAL SQUABBLING . I WANT THE SAME THING YOU DO , AND FRANKLY , I DON 'T THINK IT 'S ASKING TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO HAVE A LITTLE FAITH . I ASSURE YOU , I 'VE GOT EVERYTHING COVERED . IS THAT A CONCLUSION OR A FACT ? THAT IS A FACT ! I PROMISE YOU DR. CHAMBERS AND ALL THE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE PERFECTLY SAFE . WILL BE PERFECTLY SAFE . YAAH ! UNH ! UNH ! MATTHEW GIDEON , CAPTAIN .

AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? AND WHO DO YOU TRUST ? THIS IS THE 11th RUN I 'VE MADE TODAY . I THINK HALF THIS SHIP IS GOING ON SHORE LEAVE . I 'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE SOME KIND OF YO-YO . SOME KIND OF WHAT ? YO-YO . SLANG FOR FOOL OR IDIOT . I MEANT THE TOY . OH , WELL , THEN , THERE 'S THAT , TOO . IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF JOKE AT MY EXPENSE THERE , EILERSON ? NO , NOT AT ALL . MERELY A MISUNDERSTANDING . I TRY TO NEVER UPSET SOMEONE WHO 'S AT THE HELM OF A RAPIDLY FALLING OBJECT WHEN I 'M INSIDE IT . YOU KNOW , THE CITY CAN BE ROUGH ON PEOPLE WHO MOUTH OFF AT THE WRONG TIME . DUREENA , THIS YOUR FIRST TIME ON MARS ? WELL , FIRST TIME NOT BEING IN LOCK-UP . SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU COULD USE AN ESCORT WHO WON 'T STIR UP TROUBLE . OH , I DON 'T NEED AN ESCORT . TRACE , I GREW UP ON MARS . ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT I 'M INCAPABLE OF ESCORTING DUREENA ? NO , NOT AT ALL . IT 'S MERELY A MISUNDERSTANDING . I DO NOT NEED AN ESCORT . BECAUSE ONCE I GET A BREAK , I 'D BE HAPPY TO SHOW DUREENA AROUND . HOW KIND . BUT I ASSURE YOU I 'M UP TO THE CHALLENGE- - EXCUSE ME . ESCORT--NOT IN NEED OF ONE . AM I CLEAR ? AM I CLEAR ? COPS AT ALL EXITS , COPS ALONG THE CORRIDORS . SECURITY SCANS FOR EVERY WEAPON KNOWN TO MAN AND A FEW THAT AREN 'T . AND THE ACOUSTICS AIN 'T BAD , EITHER . VERY IMPRESSIVE . LOOK , CAPTAIN ... PERHAPS WE GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT . PERHAPS . LOOK , CAPTAIN , I DIDN 'T ASK FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT . THIS WHOLE DRAKH VIRUS CONFERENCE WAS DR. STEVEN FRANKLIN 'S IDEA- - BRING IN PEOPLE FROM UNAFFECTED EARTH COLONIES , PUT EVERYONE 'S HEADS TOGETHER , PLAN A UNIFIED COURSE OF RESEARCH . NOW , WHEN EARTH FORCE ASKED FOR AN OFFICER TO OVERSEE IT , THE GOOD DOCTOR PUT ME AT THE TOP OF HIS SHORT LIST . NOW , RIGHT NOW MY MAIN GOAL IS TO FIND A CURE FOR THIS SO I CAN GO EARTHSIDE AND THANK STEVEN IN PERSON WITH A LARGE BRICK . WELL , THERE 'S INCENTIVE FOR YOU . ANYWAY , WITH SO MUCH ON THE LINE , I 'M JUST BEING CAREFUL , THAT 'S ALL . CAREFUL ? I HEAR YOU 'RE MORE OF A GAMBLER , NOT THE CAREFUL TYPE . WHEN I HAVE A SENSE OF THE ODDS . AND RIGHT NOW , I DON 'T . ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE NICE , BUT- - NICE ? CAPTAIN GIDEON , SECURITY HAPPENS TO BE MY MIDDLE NAME . THAT 'S ALL WELL AND GOOD , BUT JUST IN CASE YOUR LAST NAME IS BREACH , IT WON 'T HURT FOR ME TO DOUBLE-CHECK . DOUBLE-CHECK ? [ COMMUNICATOR BEEPS ] LOCHLEY . GO AHEAD . THIS IS CARR . WE MAY HAVE A SITUATION ON BRADBURY STREET JUST SOUTH OF BURROUGHS . WHAT KIND OF SITUATION ? THE " NO LONGER BREATHING " KIND . I 'M ON MY WAY . ONOURWAY . ONOURWAY . [ ANNOUNCEMENTS ON P.A. ] [ ANNOUNCEMENTS ON P.A. ] YOU APPEAR LOST . NO , JUST WAITING FOR SOMEONE . AH . GODOT , PERHAPS . I 'M SORRY ? NO , I AM . FOOLISH ATTEMPT AT HUMOR . FOOLISH ATTEMPT AT HUMOR . I 'M DR. ALAIN LEBECQUE . I ASSUME YOU 'RE DR. CHAMBERS , OUR KEYNOTE SPEAKER . YOU 'RE HERE FOR THE CONFERENCE ? YES , AND MOST EAGER TO HEAR OF YOUR INVESTIGATION SO FAR IN CURING THE PLAGUE . WELL , I WISH I HAD MORE AND BETTER TO REPORT . WELL , WE MUST HAVE FAITH , DOCTOR . FAITH THAT THINGS WILL WORK OUT AS GOD INTENDS THEM . WE MUSTN 'T LOSE THAT . OF COURSE , DR. LEBECQUE . ALAIN--PLEASE . YOU SOUND SKEPTICAL . HAVE YOU NO FAITH ? I HAVE FAITH A CURE WILL BE FOUND . BUT RIGHT NOW I 'D RATHER PUT THE FAITH IN US AND IN SCIENCE THAN A BEING WHO WOULD LET IT HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE . NO OFFENSE . OH , AND NONE TAKEN . BUT IT APPEARS MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT . YOU ARE LOST , FILLED WITH DOUBT . YOU ARE LOST , FILLED WITH DOUBT . AND WHEN IN DOUBT , HAVE A DRINK . WOULD YOU CARE TO ? Carr : DR. CHAMBERS ? LIEUTENANT CARR , MARS DOME POLICE . OH , GOOD . DO YOU KNOW WHERE CAPTAIN GIDEON IS ? HE WAS SUPPOSED TO- - ACTUALLY , I 'M HERE TO TAKE YOU TO HIM . THIS WAY , PLEASE . THIS WAY , PLEASE . WELL , LOOKS LIKE MULTIPLE KNIFE WOUNDS . HARD TO TELL HOW MANY , THOUGH . ONE TOO MANY . TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . ONE TOO MANY . TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS ? MARK OF A DOOMSDAY CULT . THE SYMBOL INFINITY BISECTED SIGNIFIES THAT NOTHING GOES ON FOREVER . GREAT . WE 'VE HAD WHAT , A COUPLE HUNDRED OF THOSE SPRINGING UP SINCE WORD OF THE PLAGUE GOT OUT ? NO . THIS MARK IS SPECIFIC TO THE WORST GROUP OF THE BUNCH--SACRED OMEGA . THEY BELIEVE THAT THE DRAKH PLAGUE IS LIKE THE SECOND COMING OF NOAH 'S FLOOD , THAT HUMANITY IS HOPELESSLY EVIL AND DESERVES TO BE WIPED OUT WITH ONE DIVINE ACT OF CLEANSING . NOTHING LIKE THE LUNATIC FRINGE TO MAKE A HARD JOB EVEN HARDER . SOUNDS LIKE YOU 'VE HAD RUN-INS WITH THEM BEFORE . A FRIEND OF MINE , CAPTAIN MANKOWSKY OF THE FURIES , WAS KILLED DURING A MUTINY LED BY A SACRED OMEGA GROUP AMONG HIS CREW . THEY WON 'T HESITATE TO KILL IF THEY THINK IT 'S GOD 'S WILL . THEY WON 'T HESITATE TO KILL IF THEY THINK IT 'S GOD 'S WILL . DR. SARAH CHAMBERS , CAPTAIN ELIZABETH LOCHLEY , CONFERENCE LIAISON . CONFERENCE LIAISON . THIS GENTLEMAN WAS LEON HENDERSON , A VIABLE STUDIES SPECIALIST . BORN ON MARS , LEFT TO STUDY MEDICINE , CAME BACK TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE ... CAME BACK TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE ... DIED ON MARS . DIED ON MARS . YOU WANT TO TELL ME AGAIN , LIEUTENANT , HOW YOU 'VE GOT IT COVERED ? THIS IS OBVIOUSLY CONFERENCE-RELATED , SINCE HE WAS AN ATTENDEE , AND HE WASN 'T ROBBED . I AGREE . QUESTION IS , WAS THIS MEANT AS A WARNING OF THINGS TO COME OR JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT ? THIS IS YOUR BAILIWICK , CAPTAIN . HOW DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD PLAY IT ? WE NEED AN AUTOPSY , SEE IF THAT CAN GIVE US ANY NEW INFORMATION . AND BETTER IF IT 'S DONE OFF-PLANET . WE 'LL TRY AND KEEP THIS UNDER WRAPS , AVOID PANICKING THE REST OF THE ATTENDEES . CAPTAIN , CAN YOU BRING THE BODY UP TO THEEXCALIBUR , HAVE DR. CHAMBERS HERE PERFORM THE AUTOPSY ? NOT A PROBLEM . GIDEON TOEXCALIBUR . Man : YES , CAPTAIN ? I NEED A SHUTTLE ASAP . WHO 'S AVAILABLE ? I NEED A SHUTTLE ASAP . WHO 'S AVAILABLE ? Trace : QUIET PASSENGER . BEST KIND . ANYBODY I KNOW ? DOUBT IT . DOUBT IT . ANYTHING YOU TURN UP , GO THROUGH ME FIRST . I 'LL PASS IT ON TO LOCHLEY . I 'LL PASS IT ON TO LOCHLEY . Gideon : TRACE ? Gideon : TRACE ? DO YOU KNOW HIM ? DO YOU KNOW HIM ? YEAH . HE 'S THE REASON I DECIDED TO BECOME A PRIEST . HE 'S THE REASON I DECIDED TO BECOME A PRIEST . WHY ... DID THAT MAN HENDERSON HAVE TO DIE ? DID THAT MAN HENDERSON HAVE TO DIE ? TO PERISH IN A GLORIOUS BURST OF LIGHT ... THAT HAS THE LORD 'S HAND BEHIND IT , SURELY . BUT THIS ... BUTCHERY ... BUTCHERY ... WAS IT NECESSARY ? Woman : I CARRY OUT OUR LORD 'S COMMAND GIVEN ME BY MY VOICES WITH ALL MY MIGHT . SO MUCH OF IT AS I CAN UNDERSTAND . AND THEY COMMAND ME NOTHING SAVE BUT OUR LORD 'S GOOD PLEASURE . YOU HEAR THOSE VOICES , JEANNE , AND I HEAR YOURS , BUT NO ONE REALLY BELIEVES ME , NOT EVEN MY ALLIES . I THINK THEY SEE ME AS SOME CONVENIENT TOOL , NOTHING ELSE . Woman : WHENEVER I AM UNHAPPY BECAUSE MEN WILL NOT BELIEVE ME AND THE THINGS I SAY AT GOD 'S BIDDING , I GO APART AND PRAY TO GOD , COMPLAINING TO HIM THAT THOSE TO WHOM I SPEAK DO NOT EASILY BELIEVE ME . AND WHEN I HAVE MADE MY PRAYER TO GOD I HEAR A VOICE THAT SAYS TO ME , " CHILD OF GOD , GO , GO , GO . I SHALL BE WITH YOU TO HELP YOU . GO . " AND WHEN I HEAR THAT VOICE , I FEEL A GREAT JOY . INDEED , I WOULD THAT I MIGHT EVER BE IN THAT STATE . SO DO I , JEANNE . SO DO I. SO DO I. Trace : THERE 'S NOT A LOT TO SAY . I DID A BUNCH OF SCUTWORK FOR THE FOUNDATIONIST CHURCH A FEW YEARS BACK . STARTED OUT AS A WAY OF MAKING ENDS MEET , BUT IT BECAME MORE THAN THAT , THANKS TO LEON . SOME OTHER FOLKS , TOO , BUT MOSTLY HIM . HE WAS A HEALER , KINDA LIKE YOU , DOC . HE WAS A HEALER , KINDA LIKE YOU , DOC . WELL , NOT EXACTLY LIKE YOU . I SWEAR , IT SEEMED SOMETIMES THAT HE COULD CURE PEOPLE JUST BY THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ' EM . YOU MEAN HE USED TRICKS . HE WAS A FAITH HEALER . NO . NO , NOTHING LIKE THAT . REAL MEDICINE , REAL DOCTORING . BUT THERE WAS MORE TO HIM , YOU KNOW ? YOU KNOW HOW WHEN A TEAM WINS AND THEY SAY GOD WAS ON THEIR SIDE ? WELL , SAME THING . ME , I WAS , AH ... I WAS NO HEALER , BUT HE MADE ME THINK A LOT ABOUT DOING GOD 'S WORK . I EVEN STARTED STUDYING TO BE A FOUNDATIONIST PRIEST . A FOUNDATIONIST PRIEST . WHAT HAPPENED ? WHAT HAPPENED ? GOD AND I HAD A , UH ... FALLING OUT . GOD AND I HAD A , UH ... FALLING OUT . WHAT SORT ? WHAT SORT ? IT COULD BE IMPORTANT . IT 'S NOT . IT 'S NOT . WELL , I WOULD PREFER TO BE THE JUDGE OF THAT . IT 'S ... NOT . IT 'S ... NOT . CAPTAIN ? CAPTAIN ? YOU 'RE SURE , TRACE ? YEP , I 'M SURE . OK . FOR NOW , THE SUBJECT 'S CLOSED . THANK YOU , CAPTAIN . THANK YOU , CAPTAIN . PERFECT . PERFECT . Eilerson : FUNNY HOW WE JUST BUMP INTO EACH OTHER HERE , ISN 'T IT ? HYSTERICAL . YOU ARE WALKING THE STREETS OF MY REBELLIOUS YOUTH , DUREENA . WELL , AM I , NOW ? YEAH . MY PARENTS AND TUTORS TENDED TO KEEP ME ISOLATED . THEY DIDN 'T WANT ME POLLUTED BY THE OUTSIDE WORLD , BY- - BY PEOPLE LIKE ME . EXACTLY RIGHT . BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE , WHEN THEY WEREN 'T PAYING ATTENTION , I WOULD SLIP OUT TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING , SHALL WE SAY , OTHER THAN ACADEMIA ? USUALLY I WOUND UP IN THIS PART OF TOWN . IF NOTHING ELSE , IT MADE ME APPRECIATE THE DEAD CIVILIZATIONS . FOR ONE THING , THEY 'RE QUIETER . I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME THAT I CAME TO THIS PART OF TOWN . I WAS NOT HERE 2 MINUTES WHEN SOME- - SORRY . EXCUSE ME . I WAS NOT HERE 2 MINUTES WHEN SOMEBODY LIFTED MY WALLET . ALL MY I.D. , ALL MY CREDIT CHIPS- - LIKE HE JUST DID ? WHAT ? MM-HMM . SON OF A ... STOP , THIEF ! HEY , HEY , STOP ! HEY , HEY , STOP ! OH ! OH ! [ CRACKING KNUCKLES ] GEE ! GEE ! [ CRIES OUT ] [ CRIES OUT ] YOU MESS WITH ME , YOU MESS WITH MY WHOLE FAMILY . YOU MESS WITH ME , YOU MESS WITH MY WHOLE FAMILY . DUREENA ? WHAT ? ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP , FOR THE RECORD , I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT . RECORD IT HOWEVER YOU LIKE . I 'M NOT KEEPING A RECORD , BECAUSE I DON 'T CARE ABOUT YOU . IF YOU DIDN 'T CARE , YOU WOULDN 'T HAVE HELPED . NO , I HELPED BECAUSE HE WAS A SLOPPY THIEF , AND I HATE TO SEE A SLOPPY THIEF WIN . IT REFLECTS BADLY ON THE REST OF US . THE NEXT TIME I AM FACED WITH A DIFFICULTY , LET ME HANDLE THINGS . HEY ! SORRY . YOU MADE ME SPILL ! I SAID I WAS SORRY . WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO , WEAR SACKCLOTH AND ASHES ? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO , WEAR SACKCLOTH AND ASHES ? OH-HO ! [ PATS ON BACK ] YOU GOT IT , MAXIMILIAN . YOU GOT IT , MAXIMILIAN . HI . HI . CAPTAIN ? WE JUST THE AUTOPSY REPORTS . THE VICTIM WAS STABBED TO DEATH . DNA TRACES INDICATE THAT THE ASSAILANT WAS ... HUMAN , WHICH NARROWS IT DOWN TO ROUGHLY 90 % OF THE PLANET 'S POPULATION . WELL , THAT 'S NOT MY CONCERN AT THE MOMENT . REALLY ? WHAT IS ? YOU AND YOUR ATTITUDE . YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ? RUGGEDLY HANDSOME ? A CONTROL FREAK . CAN 'T I BE BOTH ? " THIS IS YOUR BAILIWICK , CAPTAIN , " YOU SAID . " HOW DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD PLAY IT ? " YOU MANEUVERED ME INTO BRINGING THE BODY UP HERE SO YOU COULD CONTROL THE INVESTIGATION . WHEN I ASKED FOR THE AUTOPSY REPORTS , I WAS TOLD THAT ALL INFORMATION HAD TO COME THROUGH YOU . YOU 'RE GIVING ME TOO MUCH CREDIT , CAPTAIN . YOU TRUNCATED MY QUESTIONING OF TRACE MILLER . YOU 'RE INTERFERING WITH MY INVESTIGATION . THE MURDER WAS DOWN THERE , CAPTAIN , AND SO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO COULD INTERFERE . THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN 'T BEEN SABOTAGED AND BLOWN OUT OF SPACE WEEKS AGO LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE THAT I DON 'T HAVE ANYONE ON THIS SHIP WHO 'S A DOOMSDAY CULTIST . CAN YOU SAY THE SAME ABOUT MARS , NOW ? OBVIOUSLY NOT , BUT I DON 'T APPRECIATE YOU CUTTING ME OFF AT THE KNEES BACK IN THE SPACE SHUTTLE . I DIDN 'T SEE THE RELEVANCE IN PUSHING TRACE . WE ALL HAVE OUR TRAUMAS IN OUR PAST . THEY DON 'T ALL HAVE TO BE DRAGGED OUT . IN MY OPINION , WE 'D ALL BE BETTER SERVED IF YOU WOULD CONCENTRATE ON FINDING LEADS TO THE SACRED OMEGA . BUT IN THE INTEREST OF HARMONY , I 'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU FULL PERMISSION TO QUESTION ANYONE ON THIS SHIP TO YOUR HEART 'S CONTENT . FINE . THANK YOU . WHERE IS MR. MILLER ? FINE . THANK YOU . WHERE IS MR. MILLER ? HE 'S NOT ON THE SHIP . HE WENT DOWN FOR SHORE LEAVE . HE WENT DOWN FOR SHORE LEAVE . JEANNE ... HIM , TOO ? JEANNE ... HIM , TOO ? BAD ENOUGH HENDERSON HAD TO DIE . HE WASN 'T EVEN FROM EARTH . WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR SINS ? AND NOW HIM ? Woman : TRUST IN GOD , HOPE IN GOD . IF YOU HAVE GOOD HOPE AND FAITH IN HIM , YOU SHALL BE DELIVERED FROM YOUR ENEMIES . YES . DELIVERED . DELIVERED IN A BLAZE OF GLORY BY THE WEAPONS , THE WEAPONS THAT WE FOUND WITH GOD 'S GRACE . THE WEAPONS THAT WE FOUND WITH GOD 'S GRACE . YOU SEEM TROUBLED , SIR . TROUBLED , LIEUTENANT ? ALL RIGHT . PREOCCUPIED , THEN . WOULD CAPTAIN LOCHLEY BE INVOLVED , BY ANY CHANCE ? READ MY MIND . SIR , I- - SORRY . IT 'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH . I DIDN 'T MEAN IT LITERALLY . HOW DID YOU ZERO IN ON IT ? WELL , CAPTAIN , THE SHIP MAY BE BIG , BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GOSSIP , IT GETS PRETTY SMALL PRETTY FAST . FIGURES . LOOK , IT 'S NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT . LOCHLEY AND I , WE 'RE JUST HAVING A CONFLICT IN COMMAND STYLES . YOU 'RE THAT DIFFERENT ? ACTUALLY , I THINK WE 'RE EXACTLY THE SAME . THEREIN LIES THE CONFLICT . CAPTAIN ? CAPTAIN LOCHLEY . STILL NOT PLANETSIDE , I SEE . BEEN AND CAME BACK . THIS IS LIEUTENANT JOHN MATHESON , MY SECOND IN COMMAND . CHARMED . LIEUTENANT CARR COMPILED THIS FOR ME . SHE WAS RATHER OBNOXIOUS ABOUT DOING IT , SO I 'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU 'D BOTHER TO READ IT . IT 'S A DETAILED REPORT OF OUR INVESTIGATION TO DATE , JUST SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE 'RE DOING AND WHERE AND HOW . SINCE THE OPENING CEREMONIES FOR THE CONFERENCE ARE SCHEDULED FOR 2000 HOURS TONIGHT , I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE CURRENT . THANK YOU . I 'M SORRY CARR IS GIVING YOU A HARD TIME . SHE SEEMS RATHER ... SHE SEEMS RATHER ... WELL , HARD TO TAKE . WELL , HARD TO TAKE . AND CONSIDERING I HAVE A JUNIOR OFFICER PRESENT , GOOD FORM WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM MAKING THE OBVIOUS RETORT . FROM MAKING THE OBVIOUS RETORT . VERY WELL , THEN . OUT OF GOOD FORM . I WOULDN 'T WANT YOU TO THINK I WAS GOING EASY ON YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR ALLEGED RUGGED HANDSOMENESS . CAPTAIN , LOOK ! WE 'RE RUNNING OUT OF WRONG FEET TO GET OFF ON , IF THAT 'S WHAT YOU 'RE GONNA SAY . PRETTY MUCH . LOOK , WE 'VE BOTH BEEN RUNNING RAGGED HERE . MAYBE WE WOULD GET ALONG BETTER IF WE GOT OUT FROM UNDER EVERYTHING FOR A BIT . SO HOW ABOUT DINNER TONIGHT , MY QUARTERS . WE 'LL GO OVER THE DATA . WE 'LL GO OVER THE DATA . MY QUARTERS . 1800 HOURS . MY QUARTERS . 1800 HOURS . RUGGED HANDSOMENESS ? IT 'S A CODE WORD . IT 'S PART OF THE INVESTIGATION . IT 'S PART OF THE INVESTIGATION . OF COURSE . SO THE GUY TURNS AROUND AND SAYS , " YOU IDIOT ! THAT 'S NOT MY LEG . THAT 'S MY AIR HOSE . " [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ] WELL , WELL . LOOKS LIKE EILERSON MADE HIMSELF SOME NEW FRIENDS , HUH ?

ONCE WE MANAGED TO PRY ALL THE REPRESENTATIVES OFF THE CEILING AFTER OF YOUR LITTLE SPEECH . HE WAS TOO FAR AWAY FROM ME . AND I DIDN 'T WANT COPS TRYING TO PUSH THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWD AT HIM . IT WAS TOO CHANCY , TOO MUCH TIME FOR HIM TO REACT . SO , I SAID WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR , HE LEFT , AND THEN HE LED US RIGHT BACK TO THEIR LITTLE STASH OF EXPLOSIVES . I CAN 'T BELIEVE ALL THAT WAS HIDDEN AWAY BY MARS REBELS . YEAH . AND LIEUTENANT CARR SAYS THERE 'S PROBABLY A LOT MORE THAT THEY HAVEN 'T EVEN FOUND YET . I KNEW THIS PLACE WAS A POWDER KEG , BUT ... GOOD LORD . SO ? IN THE END , IT ALL WORKED OUT . COULD HAVE WORKED OUT BETTER ... AND SOONER , IF YOU 'D LET ME TALK TO MILLER WHEN I WANTED TO . BUT AT THAT TIME , TRACE HADN 'T BEEN ATTACKED , AND HE WASN 'T- - AND HE WASN 'T- - NEVER MIND . YOU 'RE PROBABLY RIGHT . FINALLY , PROGRESS . SPEAKING OF TRACE , HOW 'S HE DOING ? HE 'S ON THE MEND . BUT IT 'S A SHAME WHAT HE WAS PUT THROUGH , THOUGH , ABOUT HENDERSON . YEAH , AND HENDERSON WASN 'T EVEN MEANT TO BE COMING HERE . HE WAS A LAST-MINUTE ADDITION . SEE , SABOT CAME IN WITH STOLEN I.D. AND PAPERS , SO HE AND HIS MEN COULDN 'T RISK HENDERSON RECOGNIZING HIM . WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME . WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME . SO , YOU PLAN ON SWINGING THROUGH MY NECK OF SPACE ANY TIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE ? I MEAN , ONCE I GET BACK TO B-5 . I MEAN , ONCE I GET BACK TO B-5 . IS THAT AN INVITATION ? IT 'S FREE SPACE . YOU CAN COME AND GO AS YOU PLEASE . SO IT 'S NOT AN INVITATION ? IT 'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE . CAPTAIN ... YOU ARE THE MOST DOUBLE-TALKING , SUSPICIOUS , SECOND-GUESSING INDIVIDUAL I HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE THE LAST TIME I LOOKED IN A MIRROR . THEN I GUESS THAT 'S WHY WE MAKE SUCH A GOOD TEAM . TELL YOU WHAT ... GOD WILLING , WE FIND A CURE , IN NO TIME FLAT , THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO AFTER THAT , WE PARK AT B-5 FOR A WEEK . WE PARK AT B-5 FOR A WEEK . GOD WILLING . YOU KNOW , WITH ALL THIS RELIGIOUS ZEAL BEING SPOUTED HERE , YOU HAVEN 'T WEIGHED IN ON THAT . DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SUPREME BEING ? ASIDE FROM JOHN SHERIDAN ? [ LAUGHS ] YES , ASIDE FROM THE WISEST , BRAVEST , SEXIEST MAN IN THE GALAXY . APART FROM HIM ... DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD ? CAPTAIN , I HAVE 5 YEARS TO CURE THE DRAKH PLAGUE . DO I BELIEVE IN GOD ? DO I BELIEVE IN GOD ? I 'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT IN 5 YEARS ... AND ONE DAY . AND ONE DAY . WHERE 'S SARAH ? WE SHOULD GET BACK SOON . I DON 'T KNOW . HEY ... YOU ALL RIGHT ? I JUST--I WISH YOU COULD HAVE SEEN ANDRE BACK WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM . HE WAS THE SWEETEST , MOST INTELLIGENT MAN . AND LOOK WHAT HE BECAME . HE PROBABLY THOUGHT ALL THIS DOOMSDAY STUFF WAS GOD 'S WILL BECAUSE HE THOUGHT VOICES IN HIS HEAD WERE TELLING HIM SO . CRAZY . ON THE OTHER HAND , JOAN OF ARC CLAIMED TO HEAR VOICES , AND SHE GOT CANONIZED . BUT YOUR FRIEND ENDED UP CANNON FODDER . FUNNY OLD WORLD , ISN 'T IT ? FUNNIER THAN YOU THINK . WE FOUND THIS AMONG OUR LITTLE FRIEND 'S EFFECTS . IT 'S HIS JOURNAL . IT 'S HIS JOURNAL . " I CARRY OUT MY LORD 'S COMMAND " GIVEN ME BY MY VOICES WITH ALL MY MIGHT , " SO MUCH OF IT AS I CAN UNDERSTAND . " AND THEY COMMAND ME NOTHING SAVE IN OUR GOOD LORD 'S PLEASURE . " IN OUR GOOD LORD 'S PLEASURE . " I CHECKED THE RECORDS . ALL OF THE ENTRIES ARE THINGS JOAN OF ARC ACTUALLY SAID . PROVES MY POINT . HISTORY IS RARELY CUT AND DRIED WHEN IT COMES TO RELIGION . ONE MAN 'S LUNATIC IS ANOTHER MAN 'S SAINT OR HOLY MARTYR . IN THE WORDS OF T.S. ELIOT , SAINT AND MARTYR RULE FROM THE TOMB . EXCEPT WE END UP TRANSLATING THOSE ORDERS TO SUIT OURSELVES . WE USE THEM TO JUSTIFY MURDER , TORTURE , SLAVERY . YOU KNOW , ON MY WORLD , IT WAS CONSIDERED A GREAT EVIL TO EVEN TRY TO PRESUME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSE . WELL , THEY 'RE A LOT SMARTER THAN WE ARE . WHAT 'S THAT OLD SAYING ? ANYWAY , CHRIST CAME TO TELL US TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER . AND THE LAST 2,200 YEARS WE 'VE SPENT KILLING EACH OTHER ON HOW HE SAID IT ? WHEN YOU BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE ENEMY , YOU BECOME THE ENEMY . YOU BECOME THE ENEMY . I 'M STARTING TO AGREE WITH HIM , AND THAT 'S MORE THAN I CAN BEAR . WOULD YOU CARE TO DANCE ? LOVE TO . LOVE TO . CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS .

 Steed . Major Paul Croft , John Steed . Sorry , I haven 't a hand to offer you . Come in Major , delighted to see you at last . - How was the trip ? - He was two hours late . - Held up in Karachi . - Runaway elephant . No. an elephant on the runway . Very old and very tame . No drama , I 'm afraid . How do you do ? Do sit down , won 't you ? I 've heard a lot about you . Puts us on equal terms then . Mrs. Peel has been talking about you all week . I 've been looking forward to seeing you . Gather you 've known each other a long time . Since I was seven . Six . She was a leggy little horror with pigtails . - I can 't believe it ! - It 's true . We lived next door to each other . I used to climb over the wall ... I mean the champagne . I specifiically asked my vintner for a ' 26 . He sent me a ' 27 . What 's a digit between friends ? On his fiirst day home . after years of defending some far flung corner of the British empire he deserves a more than special vintage . The ' 27 will be fline , really . and you don 't have to call me Major . Not anymore . It 's a fact . I 'm resigning my commission . I bought a house in the country . I 'm going to settle down and growthings . - Breed horses or something . - That 's marvellous . - Where is this place ? - Near Little Storping . - Little Storping ? I don 't know it . - Neither do I. I bought the place sight unseen . I saw an advert . Sounded like the place I wanted so I took a chance . Despite the year , I hope the temperature will prove acceptable . . You 're going to Little Storping later ? Yes . Forbes has gone on ahead to tidy up . Private Forbes ? Is he still with you ? Yes. after all these years , I still can 't get rid of the beer soaked rascal . He ought to be there . He 's probably stopped for a drink at the pub . We 've had good times . - It 's nearly 12 : 00 . - Is it , now ? I 'd better be moving , before the Major starts after me . I thought you said you had him trained properly . Father ! You knowthere 's an event at 12 : 00 . I 'd forgotten . an event ? Local carnival or something ? anything worth watching ? Nothing really interesting really . - You 're not going yet ? - Not without another . No . Of course he 's not . Particularly as this one 's on the house . It 's the last one , mind . I must say this is a friendly little place . We don 't get many strangers passing through . Off the beaten track , you see . Hardly anyone knows it 's here . What exactly is this event ? - Pardon ? - an event. at 12 : 00 , you said ... Hear that ? - Hear what ? - Gun shots . Sounded like gun shots . Gun shots ? You hear anything like that ? - Like what ? - Gun shots . Seem to come from outside . Probably a car backfiiring or your imagination . I really must be going this time . See you again perhaps . Next time you 're passing through . You 'll see me sooner than that and more often . Moving in . - Permanently ? - That 's right . Just taken the house on the hill . You know I could easily hire a car . - I wouldn 't hear of it . - Her stubborn streak . - It 's quite a way . - I feel like a drive . It 's been a while . We 've got a lot to talk about . - I want to see this new house . - It 's not new . It 's a big , honest country house . Come to give me a hand ? That 's what I call neighbourly . Really neighbourly ! Careful with that . Valuable . I told you to be careful ! That was clumsy . Wonder what 's in that box . . There 's a funny thing . Did you notice that man back there ? Frederic Williams . Big fiinancier . Or at least he was . Sorry . I 've been out of touch for a while . His empire crumbled a few weeks ago . He was virtually ruined . What 's funny about that ? Did you notice the driver of the limousine a few miles back ? - The thick set chap ? - Samuel Morgan . The man who slipped the fiinancial knife into Williams . Quite a coincidence . Out of the way spot like this . and two of the deadliest enemies within a mile or so of each other . I can 't tell you how much I appreciate all this . The places I 've lived in the last few years . Lonely , remote places most of them . You lose the knack of dealing with people . This way , you 're helping to ease me gently back into civilisation . He must 've got drunk . Raving drunk ! I 'll break him . I 'll take hold of his scraggy little neck ... You don 't know what 's happened . You don 't know if it was him . Of course , it was him . I warned him before about drinking. a hundred times . Who else would ... He doesn 't seem to be here . He 's probably skulking in the bushes somewhere . Or else gone back to get recharged . I 'm going to check the pub . I 'll roust him out . - You stay here ! - Take my car ! Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ? I 'm looking for a man called Forbes . about so high . Neat looking fellow . - Clean shaven . - Sorry . - You didn 't stop to think . - I don 't know any " Forbes . " That means he 's a stranger . I haven 't seen a stranger all week . He must 've been here . He can 't resist ! - What 's the trouble ? - This man is looking for a ... Man called Forbes . Medium height . Dapper . - Perhaps , you 've seen him . - I 've told him we 've seen no strangers . She 's quite right . I 'm sorry we can 't help you . How about you ? I can add nothing to what Jennifer has already told you . Perhaps , he thinks our Jenny 's lying . I had a mysterious message to meet someone . I was to learn something to my advantage . Financial advantage . I suggest you wait a little longer . I 've wasted enough time . If anyone does turn up , give him one of those . I think she 's coming ' round . The brandy did the trick . are you feeling better ? I 'm Dr. Haynes . You 've been lucky . No bones broken . But you 've taken rather a nasty bump . Would 've been nastier if she 'd hit that wall . She must have skidded past it by inches . Wall ? - Skidded ? - See for yourself . I don 't remember driving back . - I was with Forbes . - There was nobody else in the car ... - ... when we found you . - I 'd found his body . Been murdered him with a sickle . - Sit down ... - I didn 't imagine it . He was there . On the grounds of Paul 's house . Who 's Paul ? Major Croft . He was coming here . You must 've seen him . I don 't know what 's happening here . I do knowthat I found Forbes . Dead . Then something hit me . She 's more badly hurt than you suspected . There 's a dead man at Paul 's house . Why don 't you come and see for yourself ? a waste of time . You seem very sure of your facts . I am . are you coming ? Come now . all right , I 'll come with you . We 'd better take my car . Paul went berserk when he sawthe wreckage . He wasn 't thinking clearly . Jumped to the fiirst assumption . That Forbes had got drunk . One can hardly blame him . When he saw all those beautiful things just destroyed . Where do we fiind the body ? You gave me a scare . I must 've dozed off . - You knowthis man ? - Yes , everybody knows him . Best chopping man in the village . When he 's awake . - Why are you here ? - Looking after the gardens . - For Major Croft ? - I don 't know anyone named Croft . The estate agents asked me to keep the place tidy . - In case it sells . - But it has been sold . The important question is , how long have you been sleeping ? Since about 12 : 30 . He can 't have been ! - The whole time ? - afraid so . You know me . Heavy sleeper . I shouldn 't worry about it . This sort of thing happens . a blow on the head can lead to all sorts of things. amnesia . Even hallucinations . It 'll soon pass . My surgery 's not far from here . It 's on the road up . If we stop in , I 'll give you some pills . Can you give me an explanation , too ? No . That I 'm afraid I can 't do . Press that one , you might set it on fiire ! Nice lookin ' motor ! Did you fiind a body ? I 'll take you up on that offer . The pills . Yes . Okay , fline . It 's not far . Follow me . Do you mind ? Here we are . Take two of these four times a day ... - May I use your phone ? - Surely . What about the pills ? Just an excuse . I didn 't want them to suspect . Operator ? What do you mean ? The men in the village . One of them had Paul 's watch . If I can persuade you to take a sedative ... I 'm all right . Operator ? Get me the police , please . Get me the nearest police station and please hurry . One moment , please . I hope you know what you 're doing . I can 't support you on this . Medically , you 're suffering from ... - County police . - Hello , police ? - Sergeant Banks here . Can I help you ? - You certainly can . I 'd like to report a murder . - Murder ? - Possibly two . - Your name ? - Mrs . Emma Peel . Where are you phoning from ? Dr. Haynes ' surgery . Little Storping . Stay there . We 're on our way . This is ridiculous . - I 've known these people for half my life . - Since you were six years old ? That 's how long I 've known Paul . It 's a strange story . - Very strange . - You 've probably heard stranger . Not many . No . You went to the house ? - and saw nothing ? - No . Nothing . I 'm sorry but that is the truth . Don 't worry . We 'll soon get to the bottom of this . We 'll run up there and make a thorough check . I can contact you here , later ? You 're welcome to stay . - Oughtn 't I to go ... - From now on , it 's police business . Think we can handle it . The watch ! I forgot to tell him about Paul 's watch . Did you catch him in time ? That tidbit about the watch must have added credibility to your story . - Have you ever seen him before ? - Banks ? No , he must be the county police . You all right ? You ought to lie down and rest . You wouldn 't know if he were a policeman ? You saw him arrive in a police car and wearing uniform . and patterned socks . Did you ever see a uniformed police man wearing brightly coloured patterned socks ? I see . What are you doing ? Calling the hospital . That blow on the head , caused more trouble than I anticipated . No you don 't . Thanks for the hospitality and all that . You 're not going to lock me up ... Call a meeting . an emergency meeting . Sorry about that . . Something 's got to be done. and quickly ! I gained us some time . I told her to stay at Haynes ' place . We 've got Maggie to thank for that . If she 'd lost her head when Peel started asking for the police ... - Well done . - Don 't forget I helped . Her fiirst thought was to contact me . Because you 're the only one who flits the uniform ! Just a minute ! We 're wasting time ! We 're here to decide to do about Mrs. Peel ! Where 's Haynes ? He called this meeting . That 's right . Where is he ? She 's got away . There she is ! Get the helicopter . I 'm afraid it 's no use . We 've all of us tried . I 'm afraid these old things were made to last . - Where is this place ? - Little Storping Museum . I often used to help the curator here . Forgive me . My name is Purser . Jeremy Purser . I was once the vicar here . This is George Miller . He was the police sergeant for this district . - The local magistrate . - How do you do ? She ran the telephone exchange . They thought she yelled too much . They ? Those mad men ? They 're not mad . What ' s going on ? Little Storping has become a boom town . What happened ? Little Storping seemed doomed . We had all met to write its epitaph . Then it happened . - What happened ? - Two strangers . Two men we 'd never seen before . They came out of the pub . They were arguing . Then , one took out a gun and killed the other . We sawthe whole thing from the window . He committed murder in front of the whole village . - In front of all those witnesses ! - and you ? - You went out and arrested him ? - He came into us ! When he offered us the deal . - What deal ? - He was a rich man . Very rich . He offered us one million pounds to be equally divided ... - ... amongst the whole village . - lf we 'd promise not to talk . Then ? It was a tempting offer . Coming when it did . - It wasn 't taken seriously ! - But it was ! Deadly serious . Miller , myself , Hilary and the vicar did our best to talk them out of it . - They insisted it was put to vote . - and it was carried . There were only four dissenters . Us . - They took the money ? - The whole village as one man . They all connived at murder . Dr. Haynes swore the victim had died of a heart attack . The murderer had as many witnesses to prove it . He bought an entire community ! - The perfect crime ! - Since then ? Then the seeds were sown . a million divided wasn 't enough . The people had tasted money . They became greedier . They held another meeting . and agreed to offer the same service to others . For a fat fee , you can lure your enemy to this village . and kill him at will . and get away with it . The town 's wide open ! anything can happen in Little Storping . anything at all . You can 't just stand by and let this nightmare continue . I told you we have tried . Our predicament is impossible ! Nothing 's impossible . We 've come to a decision about you . You 're to disappear . You were never in Little Storping . I wish that were true . There 's a problem . We 've checked up on Croft 's papers . He and his man only just arrived in this country . Nobody 's going to miss them . We know very little about you . Shall I give you a thumbnail sketch ? Who knows you 're here ? Who 's going to miss you ? I 'll make her talk . Yes . She 's all yours . You could spare yourself this . You know what we want ! Who knows you 're here ? . Isn 't that enough ? Let her up . all right . I 'll tell you . Who knows you 're here ? Only one person . Who ? John . My husband . Darling . It 's Emma . Don 't be silly . Your wife . - How 's my little Johnsy wonsy ? - Johnsy wonsy 's fline ! You sound like you 've soaked up too much grape juice . You haven 't been out ? You should drive out with the children . Children ? - You 're in trouble ? - That 's right . - Is somebody listening ? - Yes . I 've had an absolutely torturous day . - Mind telling me where you are ? - That would be silly . - Little Storping ? - Yes . Had some trouble with my car . I had to drive over to ... - Salisbury . - To Salisbury . I 'm calling from there . - That 's what they want me to think . - That 's right , darling . Kiss little albert for me . and Julian and Gordon and baby Brian . Can you give me a clue ? anything ! Don 't forget , you promised to take them to the museum . - after you 've been to the pub . - That 's enough . The pub and the museum ? I should meet you in the pub at Little Storping ? Goodbye , darling . Excellent . We 're in the clear . She was in Salisbury when she disappeared . Take them to the museum after I 've been to the pub . We shall have to deal with you later . after dark . What else do you have in mind ? I tell you what I 've got in mind ! Just a little helicopter ride over the sea . and a long drop down . I was admiring the ... Your old customs . a pint of your best ale . Right away . - Nice little place . - We like it . - Just passing through , are you ? - Just passing through . I thought I 'd have a look in your museum . You do have a museum ? We have one . a nice one , in fact . But it 's shut at this time of night . I 've driven all this way . I was thinking I could get hold of the curator . - Persuade him to show me around . - That 's impossible . He 's away . For several weeks . The place 'll be locked for some time . Dear me . What a pity . Wanted to see your reaction . I 'll leave you to tidy up . are you all right ? So far . Be with you in a moment , gentlemen . Now , where shall I start ? Took your advice . Went to the pub . The landlord was inhospitable . He came at me with a twelve bore . - Hadn 't even criticised the beer . - Everyone is crooked . The only people you can trust are these . May surprise you , that I 've had little experience with this type of garment . I told them you were a wiz with locks . Not a word . Ready ? all right ? Hold it ! You run the telephone exchange , right ? This time , you 're going to put through a genuine call . Little Storping is fiinished and you 've got a great deal to tell the authorities . This 'll be something to tell the children ! Little Julian , albert , Gordon and baby Brian . Don 't know why you put it on in the fiirst place . You were there . You sawfor yourself . For protection . On that occasion , it served its purpose . True . Not only are we going to be late but the ambassador is going to take it as an insult . We know his reputation as a womaniser but to wear armour ... Very inconvenient . I couldn 't fiind a dress to match it . Maybe , we could pass it off as one of the latest Paris fashions . - Will you please ... - Hold on . Ready ? I 'll do the very best I can . What we really need is a safe cracker . It 's perfectly simple . You just haven 't adjusted it properly . all you have to do is slip it in to place . Pop ! Like that . and when you want to remove it , you ... My knight in shining armour ! Have a sip .

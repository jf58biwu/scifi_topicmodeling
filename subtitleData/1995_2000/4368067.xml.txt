 You are the tastiest woman that I 've had since last night . Hey , baby ... Alex , what 's wrong ? I 'm taking the Stanford job . Stanford ? You know , there are other medical research programs . Not with full grad scholarships . Well , I 've got a shot at the space program here . I know . We 've talked about this , John . Taking a break . It 's not a break , Alex , if you 're all the way across the continent . I know it may not seem like it now , but ... I 'll always be there for you . Well , if we 're meant to be together , we 'll be together . I love you . I love you . Pilot ! I have no answer as yet . - A little long for a starburst , don 't you think ? - Hail , Prince of the Obvious About time . Now explain yourself ! I told you , I did not initiate starburst , nor did I terminate it . - Then who did ? - Moya . She thought she heard the distress call of another pregnant leviathan and was attempting to locate the source . I like my wives pregnant and my ships cold to the touch . That way my feet stay warm and my slumber is uninterrupted . Wives , plural ? Big fella ! I was just dreaming about my final mating session when our gestating goliath decided she needed some exercise . That 's my underwear . What does this say ? Calvin . - Well , their not yours . - Strange . I dreamt of my wife last night . Of the last night we spent together before she was murdered . That was my dream . No no no . Not your wife . Someone I cared about . What about you girls ? Sex dreams ? - I sleep soundly . - I am unimpressed by your masculine memories . Pilot , has Moya found the ship she 's looking for ? Yes . And no . There does not appear to be another leviathan . Let alone a pregnant one in distress . Then why are we here ? Hmm . We 're receiving a transmission . Salutations . I apologize for the deceit , but there was no other way our signal could reach across the void . And we so want to meet you , Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan . Upon landing , our vessel heats the rock til molten then settles below ground . That 's your ship ? - Must have been one hell of an impact . - It 's a missionary habitat . It 's clever . Decreases the likelihood of an enemy being able to spot you from space . It 's always instructive how different cultures view the same reality . Where a Peacekeeper sees defense from attack , we see solitude for piety . Pa 'u Tahleen . Your use of deception continues to trouble me . Perhaps our many cycles of reclusion contributed to an error in judgment , but ... we could think of no other way of leading you here . Let us replenish in the altar of essence . In the sweet air , you 'll soon forget this world 's toxic surface . Toxic . That figures . Welcome to the New Moon of Delvia , our modest temple to the goddess of spiritual renewal . You weren 't supposed to bring a weapon . That 's why D 'Argo stayed on the ship . D 'Argo isn 't here . I am cautious . I understand your vessel is low on supplies . Lorana will show you to our food source . Please be greedy . The more you pick , the more that grows to replace it . - It 's so perfect , my teeth ache . - No , that 's from all the sincerity . Why did you lure us here ? Search yourself , Zhaan . You know why . I do not . What I do know is you invaded my soul last night and you left me bitter . Your friends were happy with their remembrances , were they not ? So you cause me to remember . We always remember , Zhaan . We simply choose to ignore . Oh , there you go . An untended renewable , it 's part plant , part animal ... total nutrition , what 's not to like ? This place . These people , their serenity . Well , at least you thought out your position , Aeryn . It amazes me how people mistake theosophy for superiority . I don 't think anything amazes you . I mean , look at this . You ever seen one of these , before ? What would you call this ? I dub thee ... Trigapod . What ? You ... No , no , no , no reaction from you . Incredible . How special . They 're a food source , John . No , Aeryn . It 's unique . It 's a squid calamari cucumber , and it-it is incredible . Look up . Look at this . This is a ship , Aeryn , and it 's incredible . - It 's also a little creepy . - Look around , Zhaan . Okay ? Almost everything we see , almost everyday , is brand new to both of us . And it 's worthy of response . On the other hand , it is a little creepy . - You know our cause is just . - I sympathize but I cannot help you . Then give us the powers to help ourselves . - When did the madness begin ? - Only recently . But already Pa 'u Tuzak is beyond redemption You went too fast , didn 't you ? That is why we must have your secret , before we are all consumed . I have no secret , Tahleen . I am just me . All that hatred and anger ... you should be insane . I was insane . I don 't know how I survived those early cycles . But you did . So how does the pious Zhaan coexist with all that rage ? Share with me . Save me . And in return , I will show you paths to abilities beyond your comprehension . Mom ! Mom ! Look at the starfish ! They 're huge ! John , come away from there before you fall in ! Mom ! Help me ! Mom ! Mom ! Help ! Oh , jeez ! What ? What is it ? There 's , uh , there 's stuff in the water . I mean , uh ... Miracles of the mind . You altered his memory . Help me to understand your powers , and I 'll help you to understand mine . Put him back and make him as he was . You are ... the most bizarre creature I have ever met . Any word ? Aeryn and Crichton have close to a forty days supply of fresh food on the transport already . Excellent ! What 's the matter ? Is there food I won 't like ? - Something Crichton said is disturbing me . - Finally ! I 've been saying that since he arrived . It 's what he said about us all having the same dream . It wasn 't the same . Mine was better than yours . I sense Delvian trickery here , Rygel . We must leave this place . Get the food first . Do not touch . The Sanctity Root . Poison to your hand . Death . R-right . Well , thanks . And you 're , um ... Tuzak . Teacher , leader , holy reaper , seeker of the flame . I am here because of you , Peacekeeper . - I 'm not a Peacekeeper . - Yes you are . I am insane . Yeah , that would have been my next guess . Insane because of you . Because I touched inside what I needed to touch you outside Right . The one you travel with is in peril . - Aeryn ? No , she 's not a Peacek ... - Not yours , mine ! Zhaan . Vigilance , Peacekeeper ... confusing times ... do not touch the root . You are forbidden in this sanctuary . - I was just looking for the meditation room . - You also carry a prohibited weapon . I appreciate your rules , but I 'm not allowed to go anywhere ... A Peacekeeper lie . I have been driven from my homeland by your kind . I will not be driven from here , also . It is you who must go . This is wrong , Lorana . We are far outside our vows . What choice do we have , Hasko ? That is Tahleen talking , not you . Don 't be blinded by her madness . I pity you . You 're jealousy . Tahleen and I share unity now , not you and I. Accept that , and move on . Zhaan , I just heard that Aeryn got booted out of the temple . Yes , she 's already taken the transport pod . She 's gone . What ? What do you mean , she left without us ? No , I wanted her to . I need you to help me make a decision . Look , if it 's about staying , you wanna stay , that 's fine . But we can take these people back on board Moya . We have no star charts or reference points back home to Delvia . We prefer not to wander . Oh , that makes sense . Hell , I mean , everybody 's lost in this corner of the universe , anyway . John ! John . You asked if I dreamt the other night . I did . I too was reminded of the last person I ever loved . Open your mind , John . You must keep an open mind . Are you sure , Zhaan ? His capacity is well below even a level one . He will understand . You must . Show him . Show him ! In the fires ... of Tadesh ... ... I search for Unity with you , my companion . Oh , magnificent Zhaan . Ease the burdens of my flesh with your soul . Envelope me . Release your mind , Bitaal . Surrender your demons . So that I can replace them . What are you doing ? Avenging the lives you have ruined . The ones you put at risk No ! Zhaan ! Zhaan ! What the hell was that ? The crime I was imprisoned for . You ... You ... you killed a guy you were having sex with . I admit I have not revealed all parts of myself to you . No , no you haven 't . You killed a guy you were having sex with , Zhaan ! I need you , John . - I need you . - For what , target practice ? I am adrift . As the past is sweeping over me , I must rely on the judgment of someone I trust . Please understand . Please . You want me to understand ? Then tell me why the hell did you show me that ? Because they want me to do it again . Bitaal was our spiritual counselor , John . He was a very powerful man . I was studying with him at the time and things just took their course . Why did you kill him , Zhaan ? His tenure was up and instead of yielding control , he and the other conservative Pa 'us hired Peacekeepers for external security ' . Our world changed forever . Delvian coup d 'etat . Didn 't think you people had it in you . Peacekeepers rounded up all liberal thinkers and voices of protest . My own father was sent to an asteroid camp . - He may still be there , for all I know . - Is that before or after you killed Bitaal ? I loved Bitaal , John . And these people , Tahleen and the others , they want you to kill again ? Not by my own hand . They want me to help them regain power . So what are you supposed to do ? Serve as the poster child for the revolution ? As we train for purity , Delvians often become vulnerable to their own dark impulses . But should it surface , they succumb as if to an infection . Is that what happened to our man Pa 'u Loony Tunes ? And now madness is threatening his followers , too . But not you ? But you 're as twisted ... as they come . They 're just insane . Exactly . - I can help these people , John . - How ? Through unity . The sacred surrender of two minds , together . Two spirits , two souls . Wait , wait , back up . You 're telling me you 're gonna give a piece of your mind , a piece of your soul to one of these people ? Am I just being stupid here , or does that sound a little crazy in its own right , Zhaan ? It is crazy , John . But where there is risk , there is also hope . Look , shouldn 't we wait until we load more supplies ? This trigger pod is missing . - Oof ! You say it 's not vegetable ? - Any more from Crichton ? He says they want Zhaan to participate in some ceremonial mating . This is such a bad combination . I never should have left them . Zhaan distracted . Crichton confused ... Crichton is always confused . Pilot , prepare the transport pod . We 're heading back to the planet . Very well . Wait for me ! If we spent another thousand cycles here we couldn 't find the strength that woman could give us in an instant . The Peacekeeper has signaled her intention to return ... with the Luxan . Stop them . Let nothing distract Zhaan from what I want her focused on . The one Crichton is distracting her with questions . - I can send him back with ... - No . She wants him here Their minds are weak . Preoccupy them all as you would children . Attack them with their hopes and fears . Is that how you would treat your children , Lorana ? So , what 's the story . When do we go ? Who the hell are you ? Don 't you recognize me ? Oh , I recognize who you 're supposed to be , Alex . - What 's wrong with you ? - What 's wrong with this picture ? Why aren 't you in your lab at Stanford ? I never went to Stanford , John . I joined the space program with you . Yeah , I ... but Alex , how 'd you get here ? Same way as you . Or doesn 't being your co-pilot count ? Smile , baby , this is for my mom . Remember now ? Took you long enough . I had to get up the nerve . I know who you are . I know who you are . I do respect your teachings , Pa 'u Tuzak . I respect your choice of murder victims . What are you doing here ? The young refuse to tend the orchard . Sanctity roots don 't grow on trees , my dear . - I need your advice . - Oh ... no . I have tasted of my darker impulse . I 'm-I 'm insane . What I am contemplating ... is also a little insane . Pa 'u , ninth level ? When the darkness rises up from inside , that is normal . It 's when you reach down to pull it up that the noxious warnings sound . - Should I give Tahleen what she wants ? - Oh , she 'd like that . Will she use the ability I give her to hurt people ? Most certainly . But she may also free a planet from tyranny . If you hear nothing from us , come down immediately . Yes , of course . My thoughts exactly . - Aeryn , are you ready ? - Ready . You 're ready ? My pulse rifle just fell apart . What are you talking about ? Just pick it up . It 's in pieces D 'Argo . I don 't know what happened . What happened is that you are wasting ... my time . I don 't have any training to use this bit ! Pilot , are there any Delvian transmissions coming to Moya ? Daddy ! Daddy ! Jothee . Jothee ! Daddy ! - Daddy , help ! - Peacekeepers . Pilot , seal all exits , there are Peacekeepers on board ! Rygel , can you help me with this ? What made you decide to share unity with me ? The potential . If you have even the slightest doubt ... we must refrain . I will give you what you wish . What you need . The smallest seed . Point me to the knowledge , and I will spend my life mastering it . I am yours . Your spirit is raging . You strive for so much . And yours is so calm . I will show you ... what you want so you might ease your soul . What are you doing , Tahleen ? I 'm sorry , Zhaan . But what you have achieved will take me too long to master on my own . No ! Forgive me , Pa 'u , but I must have all of what I need . You betrayed me . What 's up ? What happened ? I made a mistake . Why-why are your eyes red ? It 's tissue burn migrating to my brain . - Madness ? - Maybe . My dark impulses are released . She ripped from me my ability to control them . - Then go take them back . - It doesn 't work like that . I 'd have to start over . Zhaan , you 're in a temple , surrounded by the goddess . If you can do it in a Peacekeeper cell , you can it ... I spent nearly seventeen cycles tortured by my own dark impulses . Feeling insanity 's grip ebb and flow . I don 't have the strength to fight again ! No . Just - just ... stay put . Stay put . We 're not done yet . Tahleen ! Tahleen ! Tahleen ! Alex , where 's Tahleen ? Lotus position somewhere . John ... She screwed over Zhaan . John . That was Zhaan 's choice . Let it go . Baby , you should see her . And you should see me . John , we made a promise to always be there for each other . Wait , wait , wait a minute . When have I not been there for you ? Whenever someone else needs you . Alex , Zhaan is our friend . Who made a choice to stay with her own kind . Accept it . Do you remember the time that we made love in the reflecting pool at Canaveral ? - Crichton , are you there ? - Yo , Pilot , what 's up ? I 'm afraid everyone up here is behaving rather strangely . Jothee ! Jothee , where are you , boy ? Jothee ? Pilot ! I demand you help me find my son now ! Ah ! I 'm sure you heard that ! - How 's Aeryn ? - Just as bad ! I am not as bad as that ! I just , um , I can 't figure out how these controls work ... And Rygel is faring not better . He somehow believes he has shrunk to even smaller dimensions . I 'm on it , Pilot . This is a pretty sacred place , isn 't it ? Think you still belong here ? There are over a billion Delvian living in fear on our home world . - And you 're gonna save em , right ? - Not alone . It will take many dedicated to freedom . - But it serves no end if I go insane before ... - This isn 't about freedom . It 's about power . You make no sense . You know , your friend really is a remarkable woman . Whatever you 've done to my friend , you put it right . Incapacitate him , Lorana . Even if you have to destroy his mind . Why not just let him go ? You already have what you want . Because I have not . Zhaan held too tightly to her secret . I didn 't get enough to quell the madness . She will forge another unity with Zhaan , and most likely kill her in the process ! - Hey , where have you been ? - Dealing with Zhaan and the blue people . - How are we gonna get back on Moya ? - I don 't know . Look , Alex , let me ask you a question . Have you noticed anything unusual that might indicate they 've been messing with our minds ? The only person that 's been messing with my mind , John , is you . - I don 't have time for this right now , okay ? I 'm serious . - And you don 't think I am ? When am I gonna become more important to you than Zhaan ? I never gave that to you . Hey . Baby . What 's wrong ? - I 'm scared . - Uh huh , yeah , right , you 're scared . What ? Oh , when I agreed to pass on Stanford and go with you . What if things don 't work out between us and I-I 'm stuck in Florida , alone . You will never ... ever ... be stuck alone . I promise . Now how am I gonna hold you to that one ? Alexandra Kimberly O 'Conner . Marry me . You never gave me this ? No , I remember giving you the ring , I just don 't ... And I promise never to place another before me . Til death do us part . You don 't remember what , John ? Marrying me ? Yeah . Yeah , of course . I 'm ... Do you want it back ? No , no ... never . Then honor your vow . Or choose Zhaan over me and take the ring . If you return to Delvia , some may be tempted to take your word over mine . Oh , they wouldn 't listen to me , daughter . You didn 't . On the contrary . All those cycles growing up , I listened . When I brought you all here to accelerate your training , it was to create a new class of Pa 'u . A better class . And in your legacy we will shine on . But you go too fast ! Pillaging knowledge without the wisdom to control it . - I mean , learn from my errors , Tahleen ! - I have . Even now , the madness creeps upon me . But rather than sit idly by , tending trees that will not grow , I take action . For myself , and for my homeland . What you do is worse than the insanity you seek to stave off ! You 're quite lucid today , father . Zhaan . Come back to Moya with us . No , Tahleen needs me . I will become a Pa 'u dedicated to helping others . After all she 's done ? Yes . I will join in unity with her one more time .. You 're full of it . You 're gonna kill her , aren 't you ? Just like you did your lover . You were always the most clever one on Moya . But I will not miss you . Zhaan . Just stop . Stop thinking about Tahleen . I want you to think about yourself for a little while The urge to give retribution is intoxicating . I have missed it . You know , Alex said that you were gonna do this . That you 'd quit . - Alex ? Who is Alex ? - Alex . My wife . I should not have brought you here . Let 's face it . We are both lost . Why do you care for Zhaan so much ? Huh ? What kind of question is ... Why is Zhaan so important to you ? Honey , think of all the times she 's put herself on the line for us . Not for me , John . You know what ? This is stupid . - She likes you . - She can 't like me ... because she doesn 't even know me . What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm not here , John . I 've never been . Baby , they are messing with your mind . You flew with me . We share quarters on Moya . Forced memories ... to distract you . You 're real . No . I love you . I release you from what is not true . How , in God 's name , do you call yourself a priest ? I have no excuse . So what now ? Kill me ? Cage me ? Teach me tricks ? Your feelings for Zhaan , I share them , too . And for you , and the others . We have fallen off the path . The Sanctity Root around which our temple revolves represents purity of thought and intent . Your tree ... it 's twisted on itself . Whilst in your mind , you have shown me the ember of my own virtue . Next time , ask . If you are willing to take the risk , you may be able to accomplish the same result with Zhaan . I am sorry , but you must focus on this moment . Your friends ' lives hang in the balance . I get a vote ! I say we go down there and shoot them all . Oof ! Look , D 'Argo almost stepped on me ! Your Eminence ! You were never any smaller than your current stature . You must not invade our temple ! The balance is very ... delicate . Please , I have restored your memories . Now , allow us to do it our way . You have two arns . That 's all . Why do you disturb me as I prepare for unity with Zhaan ? Because what you are doing is wrong . Such simple analysis from a vessel I poured much effort into . How disappointing . If you thought so little , why choose unity with me in the past ? Because you were too foolish to look deeper and question me . You were easy and pleasurable . Pardon the intrusion , Pa 'u , but I think you should know . Zhaan and Crichton have fled to the surface in an attempt to reach their ship . Then I must stop them . Where is she ? The part of Tahleen ' in tonight 's unity will be played by John Crichton . You wish to share unity with me ? You guys are always going on about how hot it is , I thought I 'd give it a go . This is not sex . The fusion of our two minds would surely kill you . Not if you 're careful . I hear you can protect me ... if you want to . I see no purpose to this union . Buck buck buckawk ! Your translator microbes handle that one ? Although ... I have always wondered what could possibly go on in there ... Not a lot . I 'm a guy . C 'mon , Zhaan . What are you afraid of ? Take my head . Our two spirits will pass into each other until we inhabit a single consciousness . Too late to be afraid . Move into me . Oh , my . What is that ? Unity . It 's like ... Disney on acid . Like ten years of really great sex all at the same time . Oh , god . What is ... what is that ? The core of my soul . The part of me that 's capable of murder . What-what 's happening ? What-what 's happening to me ? There is something else , John . Do not absorb any of my rage . Alright . Alright . Alright . We must separate now , John . I don 't know how much longer I can protect you . No . There 's something in me that you need to see . Look at yourself as I see you . Gentle . Giving . That 's you , Zhaan . Tahleen can 't take that , and she didn 't . You 're still that Pa 'u . Follow me , Zhaan . See what I see . Build on that peace . Be pure again . Zhaan ! Zhaan ! Fight it . Fight all the things that betray you . Thank you , John . How come ... I can 't remember ? The details or thoughts in mind fade after unity . But the essence of solidity remains . Stop ! How dare you ? The tree is the center of your existence , right ? The source of your goodness , your spiritual flame ... well burn down your temple , sister , because you 're a bastard sect in any religion . I will destroy your useless mind . How did you block him from me ? Unity also gifted me with a part of you , Tahleen . I am now a Pa 'u of the tenth level , able to protect . We want the same thing , Zhaan . No , we don 't . You reach for the dark impulses I leave behind . We all visit the precipice . Each one of us must find our own way down . With your father gone , he will need you to tend his orchard . John ? It 's okay . What are you doing ? The vestments of a Pa 'u feel like a shroud . I am no longer worthy . You do that and she wins . It 's not about winning , John . Each day infuses us with the knowledge we carry into tomorrow . I-I will be a Pa 'u again . But I am not today . It seems a shame . Waste all those years of training . Hardly wasted . They were the best cycles of my life .

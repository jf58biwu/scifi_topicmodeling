 [ Whirring ] I can 't see it . Why can 't I see it ? We should be right on top of it . We 've got to get them to turn back now , Devon . - John ? - [ Beeps ] There 's been a small error . Wejust received a pulse , strongest one yet - a little too strong , I 'm afraid . - What do you mean by that ? - We believe ... it was its terminal event . [ Devon On Headset ] Last gasp , so to speak . - Well , where is it ? - 250 klicks northeast . - That 's over a day from here . - John , I 'm sorry . We got a very good read this time . She went out with quite a surge . - All this way for nothing . - No . Not for nothing . You 're not thinking what I think you are ? We 've come this far . Now , wait a minute . This is crazy . You 're two days past fail-safe already , John . You cannot go on ! John , I want you to turn back immediately . - If we turn back , Adair , we don 't know what we 're givin ' up . - That is my point , John . You don 't know . You are taking much too big a risk - We are not even sure what it is . The transmission could be a mirage . We have picked them up before . It could be a mimic from some unknown source . - And it could be number nine . - [ Beeping ] [ Sighs ] I figure we go on half rations , we got a chance . Half rations ? I thought we were on half rations . Hey , Morgan ! - I 'm - It was just a drop . - We didn 't come all the way out here thinking it was a mirage , did we ? What if it 's number nine and we walk away ? - What do we tell the others ? - We tell them that we decided not to commit suicide . That 's what we tell ' em . I think we should go , for the sake of the group . I can 't believe this ! I don 't wanna go back unless we know for sure . Gotta be unanimous , right ? Right . Let 's go . [ Alonzo ] Let 's go , Morgan . Next time I volunteer for something , remind me how unsuited I am for this kind of stress . I 'll be the first . [ Devon On Headset ] John-John , stop . You barely have enough supplies to make it back . Just point us in the right direction , Adair . Hey , look . See that ? [ Julia ] Is that it ? [ Danziger ] I don 't know . [ Danziger ] We found it . It 's number nine . [ Julia Laughs ] [ Morgan ] Wait till everybody sees what we brought ' em . We 're gonna be heroes ! [ Julia ] Oh , no . God . We 're dead . We 're all dead . [ Danziger Narrating ] In the 117 days we 've been on this planet , few had been as disappointing as this . Cargo Pod 09 would 've been quite a find . Foodstuffs , converters , vehicles . Whether it was the atmosphere that broke it up or the Grendlers didn 't matter . We risked our lives on the chance that something might be left . [ Morgan ] Nothing . Not even a can of cold heat . - [ Julia ] We 'd better head back . - Can 't do it . Rail 's runnin ' hot . Needs to cool down for at least a couple hours . Danziger , every minute we delay is another minute closer to starvation . Morgan , you wanna start walkin ' , be my guest , but I 'm not gonna risk burning ' out that vehicle . - I 'd rather make a run for it . - [ Julia Sighs ] We 're gonna need the rail if we stand any chance at all . The best thing is to rest and slow down our metabolics . Let 's set up a shelter . I can 't believe this , Devon . They barely had enough to make it back . We tried to stop them . They took a vote . They were all raised on the stations . They have no idea what they 're up against . Bess , please . We have to stay calm . [ Scoffs ] Devon , have you ever seen anyone starve to death ? Have you ever watched anyone trying to eat dirt , trying to suck the moisture out of mud ? [ Door Closes ] True , the , uh - the scouting party 's in trouble . I 'm not gonna lie to you . They 'll be okay . I know Dad . He 'll get them through it . I know he will . [ Door Opens , Closes ] All right . Let 's go . Mom , you 're not going too , are you ? [ Yale ] No . She 's staying right here . She 's staying right here where she 's needed most . She 's fully charged , packed and ready . If they 're unconscious , administer hydration caps immediately . Don 't even bother to take their pulse , all right ? As long as they keep moving , you guys should intercept ' em within about four or five days . Assuming no delays . Exactly . I want you guys to keep in contact every couple of hours . Please . I cannot afford to lose you too . Devon , don 't worry . No one 's gonna lose anyone . Don 't worry , Devon . We 'll find ' em in time . [ Shudders ] I think if we head southeast just two degrees , we could knock off half a day . [ Alonzo ] No way to be sure about that . No . It 's just an educated guess . [ Morgan ] Oh , great . The difference between life and death left to a guess . Can you be helpful , please ? We don 't know what kind of terrain 's out there . Rail might not handle it . [ Alonzo ] Don 't you wanna risk it ? [ Morgan ] Risking it got us into this mess , I hope you remember . I say we stay the course and hope Yale and Walman don 't decide ... to risk some educated guesses of their own . Maybe we could save some time without that dead weight we 're carrying around back there . Oh , knock it off . Oh , that would make sense , wouldn 't it ? [ Alonzo ] You too , Morgan . After all , I 'm the only one who didn 't want to go past fail-safe in the first place ! - Morgan , shut up ! - Maybe if someone had paid attention - - Pay attention to this ! You don 't zip that waste , I 'm gonna knock - - John ! [ Julia Yelps ] [ Groans , Pants ] Sound off . Heller ? I 'm fine . Alonzo ? Barely . Morgan ? [ Groaning ] [ Morgan Groans ] I 'm afraid not . I can 't move my legs . [ Bird Shrieks ] How 's he doin ' ? We 're not gonna make it . Don 't say that . [ Sighs ] We have no food left . We finished the water this morning . We 've got maybe 36 hours , maybe not even that . You can 't give up . That would be the worst thing to do . [ Whimpering ] Alonzo , I feel so helpless . I can 't do anything . I know . - [ Groans ] - [ Alonzo ] Okay . Morgan . Morgan ? [ Device Beeps ] Damn . [ Sighs ] How 's he doin ' ? There 's not much you can do under these conditions . Well , we couldn 't move him even if we wanted to . Anything ? [ Scoffs ] We 're lucky this thing 's transmitting at all . Without the proper tools , I 'll never get voice-comm back , let alone visual . [ Sighs ] Well , under the circumstances , maybe that 's for the best . [ True 's Voice , Echoing ] Daddy . What am I gonna do , Daddy ? What am I gonna do without you ? No . Please , no . - " [ Walman ] " Yeah , that 's it . That 's theirs . - [ Whirring ] [ Yale ] Are they alive ? I can 't tell . They 're not moving . [ Monocular Whirring ] Let 's go . Let 's go ! - [ Gasps ] - " [ Walman ] " Yale . ! [ Groans ] Oh . What happened here , huh ? Are you all right ? Yes . I 'm all right . No . I 'm all right . I 'm all right . Give me the bag . Morgan . [ Grunts ] What do you think , John ? Well , we 're lucky the frame 's not bent . We 're gonna need some help gettin ' it started , though , check the other systems . Mm . Okay . [ Device Whirring ] Whoo . There . Something 's strange here . [ Sighs ] They look a lot healthier than they should be . That 's for sure . No . It 's more than that . None of them have said two words to each other since we brought them around . And that 's not all . The Mag-Pro 's been fired . Fired ? Yeah . I found it armed when we first came here . Danziger mumbled something about seeing an intruder one night . Just his imagination , he said . But you 're not buying it . I don 't know . Something went on here . That 's for sure . [ Labored Breathing ] [ Bird Shrieks ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] - They 're here ! They 're here ! Come on ! - " [ Bess ] Morgan . ! Oh , my God . ! " [ Woman ] They made it ! Morgan ! Dad ! True girl . [ Julia ] ... injured his back when we crashed . I 'm more concerned about his fever . Yeah . Boy . What happened to your head ? It 's fine . [ Chattering ] Sorry . Looks like I put you all through hell for nothin ' . All that matters is you 're safe , that you 're back and you 're safe . Yale . [ True ] I 'm so happy you 're back . Please . I can 't . No . Please . [ Whimpers ] Shh . It 's okay , sweetheart . [ Screaming ] No ! [ Scream Echoes ] [ Panting ] Mom . ! Mom , hurry up . ! Come here . ! What is it ? What ? It 's dead , isn 't it ? For some time now , judging by the state of rigor . It 's been shot . Yeah . That looks like a Mag-Pro wound . What ? [ Inaudible ] John , what 's going on ? What happened out there before we got to you ? [ True 's Voice , Echoing ] Daddy ? - [ Monocular Whirring ] - [ Growling ] [ Whirring Continues ] - Alonzo . Alonzo . - What ? It 's a Grendler . Grendler ? Yeah . Just saw him over that ridge right there . Come on . Maybe he 's got a stash somewhere . [ Julia ] What 's going on ? Danziger saw a Grendler . We 're goin 'after it . Wh - No . That 's a bad idea . That 's a very bad idea . - It could have food or water . - Well , it might not , and you 'd be tracking it ... for several kilometers and wasting precious energy . I can 't just lie here waitin ' to die , Doc . I 'm goin ' after it . We won 't go far . I promise . [ Inhales Sharply ] [ Snorting ] [ Grunts ] We lost it . No . Wait . Look . Yeah . Okay . [ Dripping ] Shh . Hear that ? [ Dripping Continues ] Ow ! [ Grunts ] What is it ? It 's acid . There . What ? Watch your head . Yeah . Don 't see him . [ Alonzo ] What do you think ? I don 't know . It stinks in here . Wait a second . [ Dripping Continues ] [ Grendler Screeches ] [ Growling ] [ Mag-Pro Whirring ] [ Growling Continues ] Move , Alonzo . ! Move . ! [ Grunts , Groans ] Well , you did what you had to do . I had no choice . It was enraged . It would 've killed Alonzo . It would 've killed me . [ Door Opens , Closes ] Hey , I think you 'd better come outside and see this . - [ Snorting ] - Are there any more ? I can 't see any . That doesn 't mean they aren 't there . All right . Full alert . No one leaves the perimeter until further notice . What do you think it wants ? I have no idea , but we 've gotta find out . Yale , get - get the kids inside , okay ? Yeah , yeah . True . Come on . Come on . Coming . Dad ? Go on , True . Inside . - " Lonz . Lonz , wake up . " - What ? - It 's a Grendler . - Grendler ? I just saw him . I just saw him . Over there . Over the ridge . Come on . He 's got a stash somewhere around here . [ Julia ] What 's going on ? - " Danziger saw a Grendler . " - I 'm goin ' after it . That 's a bad idea . That 's a very bad idea . - It could have food or water . - And it might not . You could waste precious energy tracking it . It could be several kilometers from here . Come on , buddy . We can make it . Come on . John , she 's right . Maybe we oughta just forget about it . I 'm not just gonna sit here waitin ' to die ! I 'm goin ' after it . [ Alonzo ] John . ! I can 't let him go alone . [ Julia ] Alonzo . We won 't go too far . I promise . Alonzo . We 'll be all right . We lost him . Come on . No . Wait . Look . There . [ Dripping ] You hear that ? [ Dripping Continues ] Ow ! You all right ? Yeah . What is it ? Acid . Come on . There . - " Careful . " - [ Grendler Screeches ] [ Snorts , Grunts ] [ Whines ] [ Grunting , Groaning ] [ Grunting , Groaning Intensify ] [ Growling ] - Alonzo , move ! - [ Growling Continues ] - No , John ! Don 't shoot ! - [ Screeches ] So you 're saying he didn 't have to kill it . No . No . [ Grunting ] That thing hasn 't moved for hours , and it 's gettin ' on everyone 's nerves . I 'm gonna blast it and drive it off . [ Mag-Pro Whirring ] You 're gonna do what ? It 's just sitting there . It hasn 't done anything wrong . Yeah ? But what does it want ? We killed one of them . [ Walman ] It was just a stupid Grendler . - How do you know they 're stupid ? - Stupid . Smart . What 's the difference ? - We have a right to defend ourselves . - It doesn 't mean we can blast our way across the planet ! [ Devon ] Hold on . [ Yale ] Guys . Guys . No one is gonna blast their way anywhere . Now , shut down , Walman . Shut down . [ Whirring Stops ] Now , I think it 's time we all take a deep breath , try to remain calm until we figure out what it wants . And how are we supposed to do that , Devon ? Read its mind ? We know it 's a trader by nature . It possibly expects some kind of compensation . And if not ? If it just wants old-fashioned revenge ? Sooner or later , we 're gonna have to confront it . That is not a threat . All I know is something happened out there , something more than they 're telling us . You 're right . And you might as well know what it was . I 'm goin ' back . Why ? I 'm gonna go back there and bring some of it here . To eat ? You can 't be serious . Watch me . No . Why not ? You can 't . It 's not right ! Look , man . What 's done is done . I can 't change any of that . You wanted to kill it , didn 't you ? What ? - Alonzo , stop it . - It was your plan all along , wasn 't it ? You 're crazy ! You killed it , and now you wanna butcher it , right ? I 'm not gonna die ! - [ Grunts ] - Alonzo ! [ Both Grunting ] [ Julia ] Stop it . Stop it . ! - Stop it . Stop it , both of you ! Stop it ! Stop it ! - " [ Blows Landing ] " [ Grunting , Groaning ] [ Panting ] [ Alonzo Coughing ] Alonzo , we 're gonna die here . Morgan might not even last the next 24 hours . - You 're taking his side ? - I 'm not taking his side . I 'm taking " our " side . Even just a little bit would be enough moisture and protein for us ... to survivejust a little while longer . - No . - [ Panting ] That Grendler could save our lives . [ Panting ] [ Morgan , Softly ] I - [ Coughs ] I don 't want to die . I don 't want to die . Here . [ Grunts ] No , I 'm sorry . I can 't . - Morgan , please . You have to try . - Please . - [ Chokes ] I can 't . - You have to . Please . - Try . - [ Screaming ] No ! So Danziger meant to kill it all along so they could - No . It attacked Alonzo . - I had to shoot . - " But Alonzo said it wasn 't " acting aggressively . I 'm telling you what I saw ! It came out of nowhere and jumped us . We didn 't attack it . It attacked us . I had no choice . But then you ate it . We took a vote . It was unanimous . We were starving . [ Baines ] Hold on . I mean , what if it had been one of us ? Would it be okay to eat us ? It 's not the same . It was just an animal . We have no way of knowing which are the superior life-forms on this planet . How can you say that ? I mean , how can you compare us to it ? It was a she . [ Grunting , Gasping ] [ Sighs ] I 'll go with you . I 'll know what to do when we get there . Okay . [ Grunting , Gasping ] [ Sighs ] I 'll take care of it . I 'll wait outside . Thanks . [ Sighs ] [ Gasps ] [ Whimpering ] [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Bess ] Morgan ? Morgan ? Morgan , I just wanted you to know I would 've done the same thing . Thank you , Bess . I don 't care what happened out there , Morgan . All that matters is that you 're alive and you came back to me . [ Whimpers ] You know what , True girl ? I was scared . I was scared I 'd never see you again . All I could think about was you . I had to get back to you no matter what . It 's okay , Dad . You know , the truth is I don 't know what happened that night . Maybe I made a mistake . Maybe I saw it wrong . It was just an accident , Dad . [ Scoffs ] Guess I 'll never really know for sure , will I ? It 's okay . [ Twig Snaps ] True ? True ? Can 't find her anywhere , Devon . What the hell were you doin ' out there all night ? Foolin ' around in V.R. ? We were all watching , John . All of us . One minute it was there , and the next , it was gone . We can 't even be sure that it took her . What are you going to do , John ? If anything happens to True - Don 't let him go alone . No . Uh , find Alonzo . Have him go with him . You guys get the A.T.V. and follow them . Okay . Yale , you and I are going to circle around . We 've got to get to them before he does . Definitely . There 's no sign of her over here . Nothing . Keep moving and widen your perimeter . Devon , come look at this . - Grendler tracks . - Ha . She comes there . - " [ Devon ] " Oh , God . You know what that means . - He didn 't take her . She came to it . [ Chattering ] [ Grendler Vocalizing ] - [ Mag-Pro Whirring ] - [ Growling ] [ Gun Cocks ] Let her go ! Daddy , no ! It doesn 't wanna hurt me ! I 'm okay . ! It 's not going to hurt me . ! True , run ! Get away from it ! [ Whining ] - John . - Don 't move , anybody ! Don 't spook it . [ True ] Daddy , stop . ! Daddy , stop ! I 'm not in danger ! Daddy , please , listen to me . It does not wanna hurt me . Don 't shoot . [ Grunting ] I 'm sorry . [ Gun Powers Down ] I 'm so sorry . - I never meant to kill your friend . - [ Snorts ] I was afraid , and I let my fear get the best of me . It 's all my fault , but you must believe me , please . I never meant for it to happen . I didn 't wanna shoot . If there was any way I could undo what I did , I would . But I can 't . Please understand ... she did not die in vain . It was a terrible mistake , but it was not for nothing . She saved our lives . Her death meant that we could live . - " It had meaning . " - [ Whining ] Please - I 'm begging you now - let my daughter go . [ Whimpering ] She 's all I have to live for . She 's my whole world . I know how you feel , but please don 't hurt her . [ Wheezing ] [ Snif " fl " ing ] Here . There . See ? Me for her . - [ Snorts ] - No . - What is he doing ? Me for her . Please . Me for her . Please . [ Whines ] Dad ! Oh ! Dad , it didn 't wanna hurt you or anybody else . It didn 't want revenge . It just wanted to know why . [ Bellows ] It 's the simplest of emotions . It wanted remorse . It wanted acknowledgement for what it had lost . And now he 's got it . [ Danziger Narrating ] In the last 200 years , we 've formed some pretty good theories ... about the origin of emotions . [ Bellows ] Now , halfway across the universe , we stumble around on this new planet ... finding that we know so little about what makes us human , what makes our hearts shiver with grief , our chests pound with fear . Why is it that a species so different from us ... could possess these same feelings we hold so essential to humankind ? [ Bellows ]

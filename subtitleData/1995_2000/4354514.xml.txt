 I understand the pressure you 're under . I do . Daddy - Daddy ! I know how patient you have been with my handling ofJarod , but - [ Sighs ] No more excuses . - I ... - [ Dial Tone ] wasn 't finished . Mmm . [ Phone Rings ] - [ Beep ] - What ? [ Speaker Phone : Man # 1 ] I thought you came here to kill me . [ Speaker Phone . Man # 2 ] That 's a fine story . Who are you ? [ Man # 1 ] My name is Igor . Let me go , Frankenstein . - [ Man # 2 ] I 'm gonna - - [ Click , Dial Tone ] [ Beep ] [ Yelps ] [ Exhales ] Beautiful . Beautiful . [ Broots ] People think spontaneous combustion is a myth . I don 't . I wouldn 't be caught dead with a book of matches in my pocket . Hey , look at this . Huh ? [ Chuckles ] Focus . There must be a connection between " Ring a bell ? ' " and that Frankenstein movie . [ Broots ] Do you remember any of the dialogue ? Something like , um , " Who are you ? My name is Igor . ' " Hey ! Son of Frankenstein . Basil Rathbone goes back to his dad 's castle and meets Igor - Bela Lugosi - and they bring the monster back to life . It 's not as cheesy as theJames Whale movies , but it 's definitely got cheddar . Oh , you are a lonely man , aren 't you ? Look ! It 's an angel with a broken wing . Perhaps Jarod perceives himself as a fallen angel ? Or he simply forgot to put the " Caution - Fragile " tags on the box . Hey , look . " Igor knows the secret ? " What secret ? In the Centre , throw a rock , you 'll hit one . I 'm calling Bjorn and getting " shiatsued . " Broots , watch Son of Frankenstein again . See if it leads us to Wonder Boy . With half of our Sweepers out there looking for him , we 're gonna find him . And when we do ... I 've got a little spontaneous combustion of my own in mind . [ Man ] That 's him ! Get him ! [ Grunts , Panting ] I 'll get him out . [ Beeping ] Come on ! Get in ! [ Screaming ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Groaning ] [ Man ] And cut . ! - [ Cheering , Applause ] - Ho-ho . ! Whoo . ! Yeah ! Yeah , baby ! Awesome ! [ Laughing ] Beautiful work , Jarod . That is what I get paid for . - All right . - Jarod . When they said you were the hottest new special effects coordinator in town ... I didn 't realize they meant it literally . Brynne McLain . Thank you for coming . Well , it isn 't every day I get invited to a live-action résumé . It 's a clever idea . Really sings . Although I am wondering ... why a special effects coordinator would do that fire stunt himself . No one pulls a stunt I 've designed unless I 've tried it first myself . - Noble . - Smart . Considering the accident on the Blaster Beer set last week ... I figure a effects coordinator with a little " smart " is exactly what you need . Producing a Super Sunday campaign for a new beer could make or break the agency . That accident put it all in jeopardy . Which is why I wanted you to see for yourself ... how my effects sing . They 'd better . With commercial time at a million-three per 30 , I need Pavarotti . [ Chuckles ] [ Low Growl ] [ Growling Continues ] Twitch , and I 'll be washing gray matter off the walls . [ Growling ] [ Phone Ringing ] [ Growling Continues ] - [ Beep ] - What ? - And how is Igor ? - [ Laughs ] He 'd better not snore . It 's not the noise he makes that keeps you up . It 's those sharp toenails . It 's all funny , Jarod . Wanna tell me what it means ? - Ask Igor . - Right . He knows the secret . Can we do the cryptic dance another time ? Sure , if you tell me the secret of who I am . You know I can 't help you with that one . Well , then I can 't help you with this one . - But I have a gut feeling ... - [ Igor Growling ] you 'll figure it all out . - [ Growling Continues ] - [ Beeps ] What are you looking at ? [ Anchorman ] And now we cut to Marianne Bosha live at the scene . Friendship and fire , as tragedy strikes during the filming of a Blaster Beer commercial . Stuntman Dave Dugger was hospitalized with severe burns and head trauma ... while attempting to drive this Cadillac through that exploding billboard . Although a small explosion was planned ... witnesses described the one that occurred as " massive . " Well , our thoughts and prayers at Geary-Hawkins-Leavitt ... as well as Blaster Brewery , the makers of Blaster Beer ... are with Dave Dugger and the Dugger family . We all wish Dave a speedy recovery . In the meantime , we 've launched an internal investigation ... to make sure we get to the bottom of what caused this tragic accident . Adding irony to pain ... the stunt was masterminded ... by Dugger 's longtime effects coordinator ... and childhood friend Mickey Clausen . Dave and I have done similar stunts a hundred times . I , uh - l-I don 't know what went wrong . Dave 's my best friend . Excuse me . [ Bosha ] Dave Dugger remains hospitalized ... in the intensive care unit of Queen of Hope Hospital . His prognosis remains uncertain . We 've spent a lot of time and expense on this campaign , Jarod . Blaster Brewery is spending millions to launch this new beer . That 's why I hired Jarod , Mr. Connelly . He will make your beer blast through America 's TV 's on Super Sunday . [ Connelly ] I like the sound of that . Let me show you what we have in mind . You remember Ray Slater ? He 's my assistant . I was Mickey Clausen 's assistant . We 've redesigned the stunt so that the blast trajectory blows over the car . - It 'll be a safer , yet larger , blast . - It 'll be a shot to die for . Jarod , you 'll have to share your brainstorms with our director . Uh , lan ? Ian ! Yes ? Ian Tottenham , this is Jarod Lugosi , our new special effects coordinator . - Hello . - Jarod , we 've all seen explosions . But we need the audience to feel the explosion ... touch it , taste it ... cry for it . Excuse me . [ Jarod ] " Cry for it ' " ? He 's pompous and insecure , but he won a Clio directing my Mighty Stick Glue spot . Sounds riveting . So , uh , you up to speed on our campaign concept ? Well , I 've never actually seen any of the commercials . Show him the spots . The campaign concept revolves around two young guys - - Shawn and Joey . - who find tickets to the big game - In a case of Blaster Beer . - So now they 're driving across America - - In the Blastermobile . - to make it in time for kickoff . - But they keep getting lost . In our first spot , they wind up in Louisiana . Until an old Cajun guy tells them to go west . - So they blast off - - And they end up here . Whoa ! Check it out , dude . Polar bears , penguins . Santa Claus ? Dude , I don 't think this is California . No , man . - This is Green Bay . - Ah . - Let 's book . - [ Both Grunt ] - [ Engine Whining ] - Whoa ! Now , doesn 't that beat talking frogs ? - [ VCR Clicks Off ] - Hmm . So , who are these talking frogs ? Uh , last year 's big commercial . Well , this year it 'll be all Shawn and Joey ... who , in our last spot , finally make it to California . - But they - - They 've used so much Blaster power , you see - They end up overshooting San Diego ... and wind up crashing through a billboard on a beach in Tijuana . Isn 't that great ? So , let me get this straight . There are people who will buy your beer ... based upon two guys who are not only too ignorant to read a map ... but simpleminded enough to drive through an exploding billboard . That 's our target market . Jarod , we 've got three days to finish the spot and make our airdate . - Can you make it sing ? - Like Pavarotti . It needs a remote control to do whatever it is it does , and I can 't find it . I 'm sure its whereabouts lie within the clues he 's given us . - [ Squeaks ] - Come on , Igor . Do something . Catch on fire . Ring a bell . [ Sighs ] Help me . Syd , give me your cell phone . [ Tones Beeping ] [ Ringing ] [ Growling ] An audio sensory triggering mechanism . Just like the spontaneous combustion ... that blew open that crate in my office . Jarod 's annoying , but he is clever . - [ Fingers Snapping ] - Any day now , Brootsie . Don 't want him to take my fingers off . Give it to me . - [ Beeps ] - My name is Igor . Ring a bell ? - [ Beeps ] - Igor knows the secret . - [ Beeps ] - Igor knows the secret . - [ Beeps ] - Igor knows the [ Beeps ] - Igor knows the secret . That 's it ? Another dead end ? You look just like her . - [ Beep ] - You look just like her . Just - Just like who ? Your mother . Igor knows the secret about your mother . Cancel clever . Jarod 's just annoying . Broots , I want you searching the mainframe D.S.A. ' s , anything else you can think of . Sydney , check your files . Any reference to Igor - a name , an anagram , an acronym , whatever . Okay , Jarod . You 've got my attention . [ Cackling ] You think we 're gonna need stuntmen for the shoe gag ? Not if we coat their socks with Zell Gel . We can put rubber cement on the shoes . Huh . - I thought toys came preassembled . - It 's a model kit . Didn 't you ever build models when you were a kid ? Well , I built the Empire State Building once . And I carved the design for what later became the AMC Pacer out of a bar of soap . Wasn 't my best work . How long have you been in the program ? Your sobriety chip . I 've been sober ... five years and some change . - That 's great . - Dave Dugger sponsored me into the program . - He was the stuntman that was burned . - Yeah . Dave 's the reason I 'm sober today . Hell , he 's the reason I 'm alive . Sounds like a good friend to have . Is that what I think it is ? She was a beaut before the fire . That 's what happens when you go heavy on the potassium chlorate . Is that what Brynne 's investigation concluded ? They know Mickey Clausen screwed up . Case closed . I just find it hard to understand how he could screw up so badly . I mean , any effects coordinator knows how reactive P.C. is . I mean , any effects coordinator knows how reactive P.C. is . That 's show biz . You wanna keep the good rep , you gotta produce the flashy effects . So you think that Mickey put his best friend in harm 's way to enhance his reputation ? As much as I hate to say it , that 's exactly how I see it . Hallie Tosis . Excuse me ? The creature from Death Breath . Now , that is destined to become a classic among special effects aficionados . - Do I know you ? - I 'm Jarod Lugosi . I was wondering if I might pick your brain for a minute . Yeah , this is a first . Guy who replaces me on a job comes to ask me for some pointers . Well , always learn from the best . Hmm . - Those your folks ? - Those are Dave Dugger 's parents . - You and Dave were really close , huh ? - Yeah . Like brothers . His folks practically raised me . But my days in the Dugger family are over . Because of the accident ? I must have miscalculated the amount of oxidizer . Is that what you think happened ? Well , cars don 't blow up by themselves . Were you able to detect anything when you watched the dailies ? Can 't watch ' em . Here . Why don 't you take ' em ? Can 't see on tape what I see in my nightmares . I just wish it were me in that car . Have you seen Dave or his parents since the accident ? I can 't face him . I can 't face his folks . Not after this . If you don 't go to the hospital ... they 'll never know how you feel . Don 't lose the people that you love . Guy , you ready ? Have a good ride . Let 's go ! - [ Engine Revs ] - [ Tires Squeal ] [ Explosion ] - [ Yelling ] - How-How 'd that happen ? How 'd this happen ? Get him outta there . ! [ Screaming ] Help me ! Help me ! Oh , no ! [ Bystanders Yelling , Chattering ] [ Clausen ] How 'd this happen ? Get him outta there . ! There wasn 't one explosion . There were two . You look just like her . Igor knows the secret . My name is I - My name - My name is - My name is Igor [ Continues Repeating Phrase ] - What is wrong with Igor , Broots ? - I don 't know . - Forget Igor . What do you mean , you didn 't find anything ? I searched the mainframe and checked all the D.S.A. logs . There 's no acronyms , no anagrams , no nothing on Igor . And I went through my files ... without finding anything pertaining to anyone by that name . Igor know - Igor knows the secret - Figure it out - Shut that thing up , or , I swear to God , I 'll shoot it . - Without a schematic , I - - [ Grunts ] Miss Parker ! [ Voice Winding Down ] Got ... a ... gut ... feeling ... Gut feeling . Wait . Wait . What are you doing ? Had a gut feeling . - [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Miller to Cardiology . Dr. Miller to Cardiology , stat . [ Whispers ] - Dear , what - - Hi , uh - [ Gasps ] I 'm so sorry . I never meant - Mickey . [ Jarod ] Now , the gag will look something like this . That 's it ? I 've seen bigger rug burns . Those sneakers were supposed to have stepped in rocket fuel . Maybe we should have used more rubber cement . - Just make it big ! - But not too big . We got millions of dollars invested in Joey and Shawn . You should fork over some dough for a stunt double . We could soak them in petrol . Okay , first of all , lan , it 's not called petrol . Maybe in your country they call it petrol ... but over here in America we call it gas . - And second of all , have you been sniffing some ? - Okay , people ! He 's right . Gasoline is way too volatile . Safety doesn 't sell beer . Flash does . I got a day and a half left on this shoot . Jarod , work with me here . I got an idea , Jarod . [ Cackling ] Napalm . - Napalm ? - Mm-hmm . - Where did you get it ? - I made it . [ Chuckles ] You make your own napalm ? Mickey taught me how . With the right balance , you can create a massive explosion ... on a controlled burn . It 's perfect for the shoe gag . You might have a future in this business . [ Broots ] The tape from inside Igor ... is a security record of Sublevel 27 . So that 's what it looked like before it burned . [ Sydney ] April 12 , 1970 . The day before your mother died . Mom . - Mr. Fenigor . - [ Broots ] Mr. Fenigor ? - Fen - - Igor . [ Miss Parker ] Can you recognize him ? Too damn dark . - Did you find out where they 're keeping Timmy ? - He 's in Room 155 . [ Sighs ] I 've got to getJarod and Timmy out of here tonight . I have a gut feeling something 's going to happen . Confiscate all surveillance data ... especially the camera records of us now . I can 't have the wrong people finding out about this . I 'll take care of it . The children 's lives depend on us . Who the hell is Timmy ? Somebody Mr. Igor was trying to help my mother rescue . - Along with Jarod . - Syd , do you remember a Timmy ? Let 's move along . I want some more cooperation from you next time . - Who is that ? - Shh . When can I go home , Dr. Raines ? In good time , Timmy . [ Sobbing ] He 's crying , Sydney . He 's scared . - I wanna talk to him . - No , Jarod . Come on . He was one of Raines 's projects . And if this was going on in SL 27 - Timmy must have been ... one of Raines 's experiments . Broots , run Fenigor . I need to know who he is . And Sydney , you go through your files , too , searching for anything on Timmy . We 're going to find Room 155 . What , y-you mean , in SL 27 ? Again ? My mother ... wasn 't afraid to go down there . Are you ? Hell , yeah ! That 's Raines 's secret sublevel . lfhe finds out we 've been down there , he 'll have us killed . Then make sure he doesn 't find out . Where there 's smoke , there 's fire . [ Cackling ] Would you shut up ? [ Ray ] I 've been sober five years and some change . [ Broots ] There was absolutely nothing on Fenigor . [ Sydney ] And the only sign ofTimmy staying in the Centre ... is a simple discharge order ... signed by , then , Dr. Raines ... dated April 14 , 1970 . The day after my mother was killed . How coincidental . [ Broots , Whispering ] Hey , look . [ Broots ] Geez . ! How long has the Centre been doing stuff down here ? Are you gonna browse , or are you gonna help us find Room 155 ? - Sydney , what else did Timmy 's records reveal ? - Very little . No last name , no forwarding address . Common for a routine discharge . Well , if it was so common , then why was my mother so intent on rescuing him ? Like the creature said , Igor knows the secret . The secret , as to what got my mother killed , maybe even who murdered her . Easy , Parker . One step at a time . The information you 're talking about could get us all killed . [ Whispers ] Miss Parker . ! [ Broots ] What the hell ? - What is that ? - [ Sydney ] It 's a neuro-electric chair . [ Broots ] For a kid ? I think I 'm gonna hurl . I remember rumors about clandestine experiments ... involving brain wave manipulation . No wonder my mother was trying to save Timmy - save all the children . This is unbelievable . Hey , you guys . Let 's get out of here . This place was trashed in the fire . We 'll never know for sure what happened to Timmy . Maybe . Maybe not . What are you thinking , Einstein ? Let 's bring in Angelo . Maybe he can empath what happened down here . What are you doing ? You can 't sell off your business . This is your life 's work . Tell that to Dave Dugger and his parents . Mickey , they are just trying to come to terms with what happened . Hollywood has come to terms with what happened . There 's not a stuntman in this town who will work with me again . I can 't believe that . Everybody in town knows how wonderful you are at your job . You 're only as good as your last project . It 's over , Jarod . [ Sighs ] All right . I 'll buy it all . - Excuse me ? - I 'll buy everything . Mr. Formaldehyde ... uh , the lipstick camera you used in Charlie Cyclops ... the bust that you created all those wonderfully grotesque figures with . This one is not for sale . All right ? This is Dave Dugger . We made this bust on our first gig together . He , uh - This is a face I 'll always remember . [ Exhales ] I don 't know what I 'm gonna do , Jarod . I just - What am I gonna do ? [ Angelo Shuddering ] What is the matter with him ? I 've never seen him like this before . [ Sydney ] He 's an empath . Perhaps he 's confronting some negative associations he has with SL 27 . Him and me both . - [ Grunting ] - Oh ! [ Sydney ] Maybe this was not a good idea . If he can tell us something , it 's a good idea . Get him in here ! - [ Grunting Continues ] - Come on , Angelo . It 's gonna be all right . Angelo , tell me what happened here . - It 's dangerous for Angelo . - What happened here ? Tell me about - - Miss Parker , please ! - Tell me about Timmy ! [ Yells , Whimpering ] Timmy ! [ Yelling ] Timmy ! No more Timmy . Angelo . Angelo . No more Timmy . Come back , Angelo . [ Whimpering ] No more Timmy . [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Beep ] - Yeah ? Ray , it 's Jarod . You working late ? - Just cleaning up some odds and ends . - I 've got some good news . I just came from the hospital . Dave Dugger regained consciousness . He 's asking for you . Ray , are you there ? Yeah , that 's - that 's great news , Jarod . - I 'm on my way . - [ Beep ] [ Broots ] Is he okay ? [ Sydney ] Angelo , can you hear me ? Angelo . Can you speak ? I 'm sorry , Angelo . Please ... talk to me . What you know may help me discover who killed my mother . Angelo . Look , I know how much this information means to you ... but down here we 've hit a dead end . Dead ends are not an option , Sydney . Somewhere in this hellhole ... are the answers about Timmy and Igor ... and the truth about what happened to my mother . Maybe it 's time to take a look into Raines 's private D.S.A. files . Hey , Dave . You awake ? [ Whispers ] Come closer . Hard to talk . How you doin ' ? Looks like I 'll be missing the prom . - [ Chuckling ] - I 'm sorry . Hey . Don 't get all soft on me , Ray . N-Not after how Mickey left me . I need my real friends to be strong . You 're the only real friend I have left . [ Sighs ] Oh , God . What 's the matter , buddy ? Your hands are shaking . Um - I started drinking again , Dave . Why ? - It 's the guilt . - About what ? About doing this to you . I don 't understand . [ Exhales ] Mickey didn 't do this to you . He was looking out for you . But Brynne , she wouldn 't take " No ' " for an answer . One day , she 's talking to me about explosions . I told her about the napalm and gave her a demonstration . When the explosion happened , I knew she 'd stolen some and put it on the radiator . I confronted her about it , and she threatened to involve me if I talked . With my background , Dave , who 's gonna believe me ? My career , my family , my life would have been over . So ... [ Exhales ] I sold you and Mickey out to save myself . Oh , God . [ Exhales ] I 'm sorry , Dave . I 'm so sorry . It 's okay , Ray . The first step toward forgiveness ... is telling the truth . [ Tones Beeping ] Hello , Brynne ? It 's Jarod . I 've made an explosive breakthrough ... and I 'd like you to be the first to see it . Could you come by the set before crew call tomorrow ? Wonderful . [ Beep ] [ Engine Off ] Jarod . You should know I make it a practice ... never to get intimate with any of the men I work with . Well , lucky for us the job ends today . While we 're still working ... I gotta tell you I put so much napalm on that billboard ... when this Caddy hits it , it 's gonna explode like Baghdad during the Gulf War . Watch . Hey , why don 't we take the Caddy for a little spin before we turn it into scrap metal ? Okay . Thank you , sir . - Buckle up . - [ Chuckles ] Did you have someplace special in mind ? Actually , I thought I would drive you into that billboard . - [ Laughs ] What ? - [ Engine Starts ] Don 't worry . I 've set it up to be every bit as safe as you set it up for Dave Dugger . I even smeared Ray 's homemade napalm all over the radiator , just like you did to Dave . - I 'm out of here . - There 's no point in struggling . You know how strong Mighty Stick Glue is . You created the commercial for it . - Are you insane ? - People thought I was when I set myself on fire . But I did remember to put on the suit and coat myself with Zell Gel ... so I should bejust fine . I 'm sure Dave Dugger would have taken the same precautions . But how was he supposed to know you rigged another explosion for inside of the car ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Hmm . Well , maybe a little third-degree burn will help jar your memory . - Jarod . - [ Tires Screech ] Oh , come on , Brynne . It will be a shot to die for . Remember ? - Jarod , please . - Why would you put napalm on the radiator ? The bigger the explosion , the better the commercial ? Tell me , what demographic says that beer sales are more important than a man 's life ? If the commercial hadn 't been right , I 'd have lost the account . What about what Mickey Clausen lost ? What about Dave Dugger ? They lost everything . The only thing you could 've lost was just a job . " Just a job " ? I worked my ass off to get where I am , into boys ' clubs and through glass ceilings ... and I am not about to lose it all because some flunky special effects guy ... was too soft to do the job we paid him for . You know something , Brynne ? I don 't think your ad agency is going to be giving you a corner office after all this . But look on the bright side - maybe you have a career ahead of you ... in stunt work . Jarod . Jarod ? Jarod ! No . ! Jarod - [ Screaming ] [ Groans ] [ Laughs ] Ka-boom . - Did the camera record all that , Mickey ? - We got it in one . That 's a wrap . I found Timmy in Raines 's archives . Run it . Mrs. Parker , what are you doing here ? I came by to visit with Timmy . I don 't think that 's a good idea . [ Mrs. Parker ] Well , Dr. Raines ... my husband thinks it 's important I visit with all the children . [ Raines ] Wait here . Hi ! Timmy , my name is Catherine . How you doing ? I miss my mom and dad . Oh . I know you do , honey . [ Raines ] Come on , Timmy . [ Sighs ] - Hmm . - That 's it ? Well , there 's another one dated the following day . [ Mrs. Parker ] No ! No ! - Timmy ! - [ Electricity Crackling ] - [ Mrs. Parker Screaming ] - [ Dr. Raines ] You shouldn 't have come in here . ! My God ! Raines , what have you done to that little boy ? [ Raines ] It was an experiment . ! [ Mrs. Parker ] My husband won 't stand for this . ! [ Raines ] You don 't know your husband as well as you think you do . My advice is to remain quiet about this ... if you know what 's best for you . [ Sobbing , Grunting ] Timmy ? Ohh ! [ Sobbing Continues ] [ Exhales ] Raines , what are you gonna do with Timmy now ? There is no Timmy anymore . From now on he 's to be called ... Angelo . T-Timmy is Angelo ? What did Raines do to him ? Somehow his emotions ... his ability to relate to the physical world ... were driven inward ... and gave Angelo his unique gift . But took away his life . Were you involved in this ? Had I known about this ... I would have done everything in my power to stop it . And ended up dead , just like my mother . [ Men Laughing ] He actually sold you all his F.X. stuff ? Yeah , I know , I know . I don 't suppose you 'd be willing to sell it back . - For the right price . - Well , charge him double . He has it coming to him if he thinks he did this to me . Thanks a lot , Jarod . Hi , Mickey . Mickey ? Timmy 's gone . [ Beeping ] White choosing the Samisch Variation ... to answer the black 's Nimzo-Indian Defense . Very good , Jarod . Who are you , Mr. Igor ? [ Whirring , Beeping ] Sydney , when do I get to meet that other boy ? He 's gone . - What do you mean , " gone " ? - I received a copy of the paperwork today . Dr. Raines released him . Did he do something wrong ? He wasn 't special . You were special , Timmy . [ Click , Beep ] [ Rings ] - [ Beeps ] - What ? - How are you coming with my gut feeling ? - You need to ask ? Why the game with the creature ? Why not just tell me ? Sometimes the destination isn 't as important as the journey . Well , where on your journey ... did you find that surveillance tape ? In one of your mother 's safe deposit boxes . Like her wedding ring and medical file . Oh , you 'd be surprised what one could find in there . - Jarod - - Ah . You know the dance , Miss Parker . You help me with one of my secrets , I help you with one of yours . We weren 't able to find anything ... about Igor or Fenigor . I don 't know if he was my mother 's ally or betrayer . Well , keep searching . Igor ... he holds the secrets to both our pasts . What makes you so sure ? Call it ... a gut feeling . [ Beep ] [ Dial Tone , Beeps ] [ Sighs ]

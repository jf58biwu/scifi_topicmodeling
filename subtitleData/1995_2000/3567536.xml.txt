 [ Clicking ] Why am I here , Sydney ? I want you to examine some photographs . Is he a warrior ? [ Young Sydney ] Yes , a soldier in Southeast Asia . Why do I have to look at him ? There are people who believe this photograph was manufactured ... created . I want to know what you think . He 's afraid ... sad . He 's missing . The people who love him want to know if he 's still alive . Like my parents ? [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire Continues ] Why are you so interested in Mr. Starr ? [ Miss Parker ] It 's a family matter . Could you describe his manner , his mood , you know ? Uh , I tell you ... That ol ' boy was multifaceted . He walked in here , and he didn 't know a pickle barrel from a gun barrel . And in less than 24 hours ... [ Laughing ] he 's doing this . 10 : 19 . They 're all like this . Damned if I know what it means . - Oh , and then there was the slugs . - What about the slugs ? He paid extra to come in after hours and dig ' em out the back wall . Said he wanted to study ' em . He was real big on studying ' things . [ Laughing ] - Like I say , this ol ' boy was multifaceted . - Multifaceted . [ Laughing ] Did he happen to say where he was going ? He was staying at the lodge up near the highway . You might check there . - Thank you . - Sure enough . - Can I ? - Free country . Oh , hey ! When you find him , give him his toy . His toy ? Yeah . When he was through shooting , he 'd run that all around the place . [ Laughing ] That ol ' boy was just a big kid , that 's all . Funny , huh ? - Hysterical . - Here . [ Whirring ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Siren Continues ] [ Siren Stops ] [ Police Radio Chatter , Indistinct ] - Was I going too fast when I passed that truck ? - No , sir . When you passed me . [ Man Narrating ] [ Man ] I want my lawyer . I got rights . ! You better relax . You hear me ? Shut up and don 't move . - Want a beer or cappuccino or something ? - Ha-ha . Let 's see what we got here . Oh , boy ! A bona fide three-time loser , Frankie . We know what that means , don 't we ? - Automatic jail time , isn 't it ? - Congratulations . Though it does seem a little harsh ... considering that you got only ... what ? Six dollars and 37 cents off an old lady . You almost got away with it too . You are what we call a top-notch criminal . Where 's my coffee , Frank ? Run , you little puke . ! - [ Grunts ] - Ow ! Man , maybe I should 've got him a decaf . - That looked like it hurt . - See what happens when you act like an idiot ? - Put the track star in his cage . - Don 't rip that pretty shirt . - Slick move . Carl Bishop . - How you doin ' ? Frank Meyers . Jarod Starr . Two R 's . - Hey , like Ringo . - Who 's Ringo ? That 's funny . How come I haven 't seen you around here before ? He just transferred in from Chicago . You 're late again today , and I 'm still waiting on those transfer papers . - I was coming to talk to you ... - Bishop , Meyers , you two were due in my office a half hour ago . Yeah . Well , we 've been kind of busy . - I want you both inside now . - Detective , give us a break . We 've gone over this already . Now . - That woman needs a hobby . - She 's just doing her job , Frank . - We 'll see you later , Chicago . - Look forward to it . [ Meyers ] Yeah , nice meeting you . - Did I miss something ? - Typical I.A. frost . - She 's Internal Affairs ? - Detective Karen Swindell . Don 't get any ideas , Romeo . She 's the original ice princess . - You were saying something about transfer papers . - Come on , Sarge . You know how it is with red tape . They should be along any day now . Until I get the rest of your documentation ... you 're gonna be riding a desk instead of a bike . You don 't want me to start thinking you 're up to something . Me ? Sarge , I 'm clean as a whistle . Get back to work . - [ Tires Screeching ] - [ Horn Honking ] [ Siren Wailing ] Can I help you , Officer ? Ma 'am , did you , by any chance , happen to notice the color ... Whoa ! Is that a twin cam ? - Excuse me ? - You guys bore out the cylinder heads , don 't you ? Man , I 'd love to soup up my honeypot . - Your honeypot ? - My hog . I was goin ' to blow out the headers and open up the cylinder block ... but my Social Security check was late . - Millie . ! - Hey , Mill ! You 're lookin ' good ! Ride ... you devils ! [ Laughing ] Rode with those dudes in Jacksonville . - Ma 'am . - Mildred Reynolds . - Friends call me Millie . - Millie . Did you happen to notice the color of the light back there in the intersection ? What light ? Wonder Boy checked out of this dirt-water town three days ago . That 's all he left behind . Where 's the driver ? Using the facility . - Guy has the bladder of a squirrel . - [ Siren Chirping ] Hmm . What now ? - Afternoon , missy . - Sheriff . - Would you mind taking off your jacket ? - Excuse me ? Oh , it 's nothing personal . I 'd just like you to take off your jacket , please . - I will not . - Please . [ Miss Parker ] You are fired . ! I want you to know I 've seen Deliverance . You wanna give me one of these ? Oh ! That 's good enough . My , my ! Guess you can put some cuffs on this young lady . Ma 'am , you 're under arrest for violation of the criminal code 369.7 . And what the hell is that ? Carrying a concealed weapon . It says so right here in the book . Highlighted in yellow . [ Sheriff ] I guess you 'll be going with me . Jarod . [ Exhales ] So let me get this straight . This starts out as a part of this ... but then you punch it out , and you sell it as a separate product . I think you got it . Doughnut . Doughnut hole . I don 't mean to belabor a point ... but if the hole is here , why do you call this the hole ? The truth is , I 've always wondered that myself . But don 't tell my boss . I wouldn 't want him to think I don 't know the business . I promise . And I 'll have another one , please . On the house . Oh . If you don 't mind , I 'd rather eat it here . Good morning , Mr. Kembrook . ! He seems very sad . [ Woman ] Poor man . He hasn 't been the same since Marvin was killed . - Marvin . - His son . He was a guard at the BoswellJewelers . About a month ago , he was shot trying to rob it . Sounds like you know the family pretty well . Hmm . Since I was born . Mr. Kembrook anyway . I 'm afraid you 've lost me . The Kembrooks gave Marvin up for adoption when he was just a baby . A few years after Mrs. Kembrook died , Mr. Kembrook started searching for his son . - Found him six months ago . - He must have been very happy . [ Woman ] They both were . Turns out Marvin was looking for his parents the whole time too . Can you imagine meeting your own parents for the first time when you 're a grown adult ? Guess it would be pretty emotional . Oh , yeah . Even after all those years , they still loved each other . What makes you so sure ? Because they were blood , and there 's nothing stronger than that . [ Door Bells Jingling ] [ Woman ] Mrs. Morgan , we may have a sighting on your daughter . My people are flying to New York as we speak . If all goes well , you should have your arms around Catherine ... by tomorrow night . Thank you . God bless you too . How can I help you ? I don 't know who I am . [ Miss Parker ] Now , let me get this straight . You stopped me because of an anonymous phone call ? [ Sheriff ] Uh-huh . Do you mind telling me how you knew this person was telling the truth ? He sounded honest . It 's official . I 'm in hell ! Oh , now , darlin ' , you did have that concealed weapon on you ... and you 'll be able to post bail as soon as Judge Hargrave get back from that bass tournament ... and we sign ourselves some papers . - When exactly is that ? - Day after tomorrow . [ Sydney ] Thanks . The entire legal staff at the Centre ... is on their annual retreat in the south of France ... so it will be at least 72 hours before we can even reach a lawyer . He knew that . Damn it , Sydney . He 's up to something . And he needs me out of the way for three days . [ Sydney ] 10 : 19 . Could be a time reference . Forget that ! Just get me a lawyer . Any lawyer . [ Granger ] Most missing persons cases fall into one of three categories : abductions , runaways or abandonment . I 'm looking for my parents . What makes you think I can help ? I read in the paper that you helped reunite a father and son after 25 years . Friendly warning : They don 't all turn out that way . There 's a risk a person takes when they search for their past . It 's not always what they hope for . I 'd be willing to risk anything for the chance to find out . Are they still alive ? [ Young Sydney ] Jarod , is he still alive ? The eyes . What about the eyes ? He wants to cry ... but he can 't . Why not ? He feels alone , forgotten . He just doesn 't care anymore . - Care about who ? - Himself . He 's given up . I won 't give up , Sydney . [ Echoing ] I 'll never give up . Officer Starr ? - Jarod . - Hmm ? I was wondering if you knew if your parents were still alive . I don 't know . I was never told the truth . Why not use the police database to initiate a search ? I can 't . This is probably gonna be hard to understand , but I don 't have much time . - Seventy-two hours . - Without a name ... I have a picture . This is my mother . At least that 's what I was told . And my father might have been an aviator . - In the service ? - I don 't know . - I 'll see what I can do . - Thank you . Officer Starr . There 's a group ... people like yourself . There 's a meeting here tomorrow night if you 're interested . Sometimes it helps just to know you 're not alone . - [ Sighs ] - [ Door Closes ] [ Man Laughing ] Miss Parker . You wanted a lawyer ? - Henry ? - Oh . [ Chuckling ] Tell me you 're kidding . HenryJ . MonroeJr . , Esquire . Finest attorney in Cedar Point . Truth be known , the only attorney in Cedar Point . [ Wheezing Laugh ] He knew this . [ Desk Sergeant ] Ma 'am , there 's nothing I can do . You don 't understand . This is a death sentence for me . - Millie ? - What ? Finally ! Someone with half a brain in their head . - You know this woman ? - We 've met . - What 's the problem ? - I , uh ... I accidentally sideswiped a meat wagon ... down on Biscayne Boulevard . Now they want to put me in cement boots and dump me into the causeway . She ran an empty county ambulance off the road ... and we 're suspending her driver 's license . Can you give us a moment , please ? Be my guest . I wouldn 't trust that one as far as I can throw her . Millie , this is very serious . What if that ambulance was carrying somebody to the hospital ? Geez , I don 't want to hurt anybody . Look , my , uh ... my husband 's dead ... and my kids are all gone . They 're on their own . I 'm 73 years old ... and I 'm alone . You take my bike ... you take my independence . You take that , you might as well bury me ... 'cause I 'll ... I 'll be dead . A lovely ruby , emerald and sapphire trio ... bordered by diamonds . - How much is it ? - Only $ 4,000 . Hmm . That 's not enough . Well , I do have this brilliant ... princess-cut diamond with a trillion on either side ... for 5,000 . With tax that would be 5,328 . That 's perfect . I 'll take it . You do realize this purchase is going to max out your credit card . That 's the idea . [ Chuckling ] [ TV : Indistinct ] [ Man ] An odyssey of searching for the past ... came to a dramatic and emotional conclusion earlier this morning ... as Harold Kembrook nervously waited for the doors of the taxi to open ... and deliver his son , given up for adoption ... some 25 years earlier . As fate would have it ... his son , Marvin Howard Kembrook ... had spent the last 11 years on the very same hunt ... for his true identity . Also on hand to witness the emotional reunion ... was Susan Granger ... the woman instrumental in bringing the two men together , father and ... [ TV : Off ] [ Knocking On Door ] Just a second . - You Starr ? - That 's me . You ordered the doughnuts . - Raspberry Supremes ? - Whatever . [ Jarod ] Mmm . ! This should cover it . Hey . I 'm gonna go out on a real limb here and take a guess ... that you 're a big doughnut fan ? - They 're very good . - What are you , like , a cop ? How did you know ? That 's funny . Detective Swindell ? I hope you don 't mind if I skip the birthday song . I never actually learned the words . - You read my file . That 's my job . - It 's a Bavarian cream . I was thinking about getting you a Raspberry Supreme , but somebody ate the last one . But this one 's very good . Most uniforms don 't want to socialize with I.A. The truth is , I 'm thinking about putting in for a transfer to Internal Affairs ... and the examination requires that the applicant break down an actual case file ... - And you want my help . - I heard you were very thorough . Uh , do you have any particular case in mind ? Yes , I do . Are you going to eat that ? So , according to the field report ... Bishop and Meyers responded to a robbery call at the jewelry store . When they get there , a security guard , Marvin Kembrook ... is robbing the place ... with an accomplice . So this accomplice shoots Kembrook ... and then he gets away . This sounds more like an unsolved homicide than an I.A. investigation . Forensics went over that store with a fine-tooth comb . They didn 't find a print , a fiber , nothing . - So this accomplice was efficient . - [ Chuckles ] If you 're ever gonna make it in I.A. , you have to realize that part of the job ... is to get inside the heads of the people involved in the case . Marvin Kembrook spent most ofhis life in foster homes . When he was 18 , he joined the marines . I looked up his military file . He tested in the lowest five percent of his unit ... spent 10 years in uniform and never busted corporal . Not exactly a criminal mastermind . We 're talking about a young man whojust found out who he was ... where he came from . He had $ 2,000 in his bank account . His bills were paid . You want to tell me he 'd throw all that away for a fast score ? So if you don 't think that Kembrook was involved ... and the accomplice was fictitious ... who did it ? There was one piece of hard evidence left at the scene ... the slug they dug out of Marvin Kembrook 's chest . Find the gun that fired that bullet , and you find the real killer . - Oh , man ! - [ Toilet Flushing ] What , you 're late again , huh ? The desk sarge is gonna have my butt in a sling if she catches me . - Can you do me a favor ? - What 's up ? My transfer papers got sent to my house by mistake . Would you give them to her , after I 'm gone ? - No problem . - Thanks . Hey , listen . You know , I 'm kind of new around here and don 't know many people . I was thinking maybe I could take you and your partner to lunch one day . - My treat . - Yeah , sure . How ' bout tomorrow ? - Great . I look forward to it . - All right , man . - Hey , partner . How 's it going ? - All right , bro . Read this . I think we found the guy we 've been looking for . Yeah ? [ Woman ] It 's been almost 11 years ... since my son disappeared ... and there isn 't a day that goes by ... that I don 't think I see him ... standing on a street corner ... or passing by on a city bus . My friends , they all say , " You should let it go . " But , I mean , how do you deny yourself ? How do you just ... walk away from your life ? You don 't . We 've been coming here for more years than I want to remember ... more years than any of us want to admit . You people know my story , what happened to my son . - [ Woman 's Voice Overlapping ] - I 'm here to tell you that you should never give up . Never stop looking for the people that you love because it 's worth it ... even if it 's for just a moment . You know , we sit here and we ... talk about how much we miss them and ... how much we loved them . In the end , I think it 's ... I think it 's the little things that we miss the most . The way we see ourselves in our children . - [ Voices Overlapping ] - The way he sat in a chair . His laugh . The way he stirred his coffee . - [ Jarod 's Mother 's Voice ] Never give up ... - Never give up ... - ever . - ever . - [ Siren Wailing ] - [ Man ] Ah , baby , you are bumming my trip , man . - [ Millie ] Pint-sized nerd . ! - Nerd ? I 'm real , man . [ Millie ] You weren 't looking where you were going . ! - I wasn 't going anywhere . - You don 't have to yell . I 'm not deaf . No , you 're blind , lady . You gotta take a chill ... Well , I wanna tell you . You just better have a little respect ! - What seems to be the trouble ? - Feeble Knievel here almost cut me in half with her tricycle . - You little punk ! - Okay , okay , okay , okay . That is enough . That is enough . You , stay here . You , come with me . Look at that . - Is that it ? - Yeah . It 's nothing that a little sandpaper and touch-up paint won 't cure . - You do have insurance ? - Yeah , but I 'm not gonna let that old bag get away . She almost wasted me , man . What have we here ? An expired license plate . That 's gonna cost you about a hundred bucks in fines . And I could , of course , search your van . - Sandpaper and touch-up paint on ... - Mm-hmm . Have a nice day . - And you , young lady , you 're coming with me . - Oh . Where ? There . [ Meyers ] So what did your wife do next ? [ Meyers ] So what did your wife do next ? She walks in , she packs her bags , and then she splits . - Ouch . - You gotta be kidding me . - Why would I make up a story like that ? - They are so unbelievable . It 's incredible . Next time I talked to her , we were in some lawyer 's office , 100 bucks per . - Sounds like my last wife . - Oh , no . - Marriage number three ? - No . Four . Four ? Geez ! What , you got , like , a thousand kids ? - No , six . Six real good kids . - And they don 't look like him . Shut up , Frank . Must be tough making ends meet , with all those obligations . I make sure everybody 's well taken care of . Still , you know , there 's gotta be a better way . - What , like Chicago ? - Chicago ? Yeah , we know about the investigation ... the payoff money you were collecting from the dealers on the South Side . - You read my file . - New guy comes in , we check him out . You 'd do the same thing . You had no right to read my file . Besides , they never proved anything . It proves that you can cover your tracks , so take it easy . Frank and I do thejob , but we 're always looking for new opportunities . - Isn 't that right , Frank ? - That 's right . Takes a special kind of cop to do what we do . We think you 're that cop . That 's all . I 'm sorry , sir . Your credit card came back invalid . That 's impossible . Try running it through the right way . I know how to do myjob . I tried it three times , okay ? Look , there 's some mistake , obviously . - I always pay off my credit card . - There 's no mistake . Frank , looks like we 're gonna have to bail this deadbeat out before he pulls his gun ... and tries to shoot his way out of here . - Thanks . - Gracias . Look , I gotta take my kid to Little League practice . Thanks , buddy . Drop by the park in a couple of hours . We 'll talk about it then , okay ? - I 'll think about it . - Yeah , you do that . Got a little something right here . Thanks for lunch . Yeah . [ Granger On Phone ] We got a red flag on your mother 's photo . - Someplace in Delaware . - Delaware ? - Mean anything to you ? - [ Jarod ] It used to . Well , someone picked up the global scan on the Net that we sent out . We got an anonymous phone call . Whoever it was , recognized the woman in the picture and has a name ... but they 're adamant about not sending anything over the computer system or phone lines . I mean , it seems strange . You want to go forward with this ? - Yes . - Okay . They 're sending the information by special courier . - I 'll call you the second it gets here . - Thank you . - [ Footsteps ] - [ Woman ] Broots ? Wejust got a signal alert on Jarod . - Where ? - A missing persons agency in Miami . But we also monitored a response signal emanating from inside the Centre . Someone on the inside made contact with this agency ? Well , what kind of information was breached ? We ... We 're not sure . Has anyone alerted Miss Parker ? We thought you 'd want to . I 'd rather stick my head in a bear trap . - [ Bat Hitting Ball ] - [ Bishop ] Yeah . ! - So how many of thesejobs have you pulled ? - What difference does it make ? We 're throwing you a rope . The question is , are you smart enough to grab it ? - Why do you need a third guy ? - ' Cause we had problems the last time out . We need a third guy to plug up the leaks . - How does it work ? - We use the security codes supplied by the stores . - Low risk , high reward . - Oh , yeah . - What if something goes wrong ? - It won 't . Humor me . What if somebody walks in ? We 're wearing blue . We 're the good guys . They 're not gonna suspect us of a crime . They 'll think we 're responding to one . - What if they pull a gun ? - Then we take ' em down . I mean , we just make it look like , uh , we stopped a robbery in progress . - We 're home free . - Is that what happened with Marvin Kembrook ? - What do you know about that ? - [ Jarod ] Come on . I read your files too . What I don 't understand is , how did you tamper with the ballistic report ? - What ? - They never made a match to the weapon that killed Kembrook . Internal Affairs always checks the weapons of the first officers ... that arrive at the scene of a homicide . Think I was wrong about you , Jarod . Let 's go , Frank . Whoa , wait a minute . You 're asking me to risk everything . All I 'm asking is , if something goes wrong ... do I have a way out ? Throwaway . Ankle holster . Unregistered . Something goes down , we use it . Put it in the trunk of my car , wait for the heat to blow over . Look , are you in or what ? - I 'm in . - Good . I 'm glad you 're on the team , Starr . But if you cross me , I 'll put a bullet in your heart . Dad ! Dad ! Let 's go ! All right ! Tommy . Attaboy . Ohh ! - You looked great out there . - Want ice cream ? [ Tommy ] Yeah . ! I plan on suing this entire dirt-water town for every penny it 's worth . - My card . - Stanton . - Let 's get out of here . - Oh , Miss Parker . - Do you know a man by the name of Broots ? - Take a message . He says he located the target ! - Gracias . - De nada . [ Jarod 's Mother 's , Kembrook 's Voices ] His laugh . The way he stirred his coffee . Mom ? [ Sighs ] [ Cell Phone Rings ] - [ Phone Beeps ] - Starr here . It 's Susan Granger . Your envelope is here . I 'm on my way . - [ Tires Screeching ] - [ Miss Parker ] You know , Syd , I oughta hand it to him . He almost kept me out of the picture long enough . - He wants to know the truth . - He can 't , and you know it . Hmm . It 's only because of his heart . - What ? - That we are this close , Miss Parker . Jarod knew that ifhe sent that photograph online ... we 'd find him . He 's willing to risk everything for an identity ... for a life . That 's what I 'm counting on . [ Tires Screech ] I thought you should be the one to open it . - I 'm so nervous . - [ Door Opens ] - It isn 't every day you find out who you are . - [ Clamoring ] What is going on out here ? Who are you people ? - Where is he ? - [ Gun Cocks ] I won 't ask again . Sam . Sam , he 's going to the roof ! Stop , or I swear I 'll shoot you in the back ! Jarod . ! Sam , get him . - You sent this , didn 't you ? - I was with you , Miss Parker . So close ... and yet so far . Hi . This is Officer Starr . I was wondering if you could do me a favor . [ Bishop ] We got 15 minutes before the security car comes back around . - You got the alarm code , right , Frank ? - Yeah . I 'll shut off the juice , then clip the video lines to the surveillance cameras . Once we 're inside , Frankie 's gonna go to the manager 's office and get the gems . You hit the gold cases . I 'll keep an eye on the front . - What if the security guard is early ? - He won 't be . - What if you 're wrong ? - If I 'm wrong , they 're dead . The clock is running , gentlemen . Let 's do this thing . All right , guys . Let 's do this . - Frank , you all right ? - I got the manager 's office . Starr . Coins , rings and chains , all right ? Stay away from the stupid costume crap . Let 's do it . - [ Imitates Gunshot ] - What are you doing ? I was just wondering how Marvin Kembrook felt the night he died . [ Scoffs ] All right . All right . We 'll talk about that later , okay ? He answers an alarm . His heart is pounding at the potential danger . He feels afraid , with good reason . Hejust got his life back . Hejust figured out who he was . He just rediscovered his family . Imagine his relief when he gets there and finds two police officers on the scene . The good guys . His relief didn 't last very long , did it ? You 're under arrest for the murder of Marvin Kembrook . - Maybe I don 't want to be arrested . - [ Gun Clicks ] You 're going to jail . You and Meyers . All right , Starr . I 'm just gonna put the gun down . Hey , what the hell is going on ? Sorry about that , Jarod . I don 't dojail . Too many mouths to feed . Oh , my God . Call it in , Frank . - What am I supposed to tell ' em ? - Tell ' em the truth . Tell ' em one of our finest was gunned down trying to prevent a robbery . [ Bishop ] We turned up the alley here and saw somebody running out the back door . Frank and I went inside , identified ourselves as officers ... but the place was empty except for the body . The body ? Officer Starr apparently was the first one on the scene . We came back outside and searched the adjacent area ... but the shooter was long gone . Is that the way it happened ? Meyers ! Is that the way it happened ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's how it happened . Show me . Yes , ma 'am . Let 's get the lab boys down here to check out that slug . [ Officer ] Right away , Detective . Care to revise your story , Officer Bishop ? The body was lying right here . I swear it . I saw it myself . Keys . - Keys ? - Let 's have a look in the trunk of your car . [ Engine Running ] - Let 's roll ! - Hold on tight ! I 'm legal ! [ Laughing ] You 're under arrest for the murder of Marvin Kembrook . You have the right to remain silent . If you give up the right to remain silent ... anything you say can and will be used against you in a court oflaw . - You have the right to speak with an attorney ... - [ Imitates Gunshot ] Jarod was in your sight . You could 've killed him . What made you change your mind ? I just missed , Sydney . No more , no less . [ Phone Rings ] Hello . Jarod . I told you when I was 11 years old that I would never give up ... and I never will . I know you won 't , Jarod . Miss Parker won 't either . - Good-bye , Sydney . - Hold it . Just tell me one thing , Jarod . - What do the numbers mean ? - What ? 10 : 19 . It 's who I am , Sydney . It 's what you made me . [ Line Clicks , Dial Tone Hums ] [ Chuckles ] Where will he go now ? - South . - What makes you so sure ? Instinct . [ Brass Band : " O Canada ' " ] [ Clucks Tongue ] [ Mews ]

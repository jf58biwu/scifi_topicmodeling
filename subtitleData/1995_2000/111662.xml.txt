 You keep your workstation so clean . - lt " s next to godliness . - Godliness ... I reviewed your flight plan . Not one error in a million keystrokes . Phenomenal. lt " s right that someone like you is taking us to Titan . Has the committee approved the mission ? There " s talk of delay . You shouldn " t listen to talk . You leave in a week . You " ve got a substance test . If you have to take a substance test , report to the testing centre . Jerome . Never shy . Pisses on command . - A beautiful piece of equipment . - You tell me every time I " m here . I see a great many in my job . Yours happens to be exceptional . Why didn " t my folks order one like that for me ? - Have I ever told you about my son ? - No . Remind me to , sometime . So you " re about to go up . One week left . Please tell me you " re the least bit excited . I " ll tell you at the end of the week . Congratulations , Jerome . Thank you . How many launches are there in a day ? A dozen ? - Sometimes more . - Only you watch every one of them . If you " re going to pretend like you don " t care , don " t look up . The most unremarkable of events . Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1st Class , is about to embark on a one-year manned mission to Titan , the 14th moon of Saturn . This highly prestigious assignment was guaranteed Jerome at birth . He has all the gifts required . A genetic quotient second to none . There 's nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow . Except that I am not Jerome Morrow . I was conceived in the Riviera . Not the French Riviera . The Detroit variety . They used to say that a love child has a greater chance of happiness . They don 't say that any more . I don 't know why my mother trusted God rather than her local geneticist . Ten fingers , ten toes , that 's all that used to matter ... Not now . Only seconds old , the exact time and cause of my death was known . Neurological condition , 60 ° % , manic depression , 42 ° % probability . Attention deficit disorder , 89 ° % probability . Heart disorder ... ... 99 ° % probability . Early fatal potential . - Life expectancy : 30.2 years . - 30 years ? - The name for the certificate ? - Vincent Anton . That " s a good name . I know he " ll do something . You " ll do something . I quickly thought of myself as others did . Chronically ill . Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as a fatal threat . The insurance won " t cover it. lf he fell ... There " s nothing I can do . Like most other parents then , they wanted their next child to be conceived in what has become the natural way . Your extracted eggs , Marie , have been fertilized with Antonio " s sperm . We have screened two healthy boys and two very healthy girls . Without predispositions to any inheritable diseases . Let " s select the most compatible candidate . What gender do you want ? We would want Vincent to have a brother to play with . You have specified hazel eyes , dark hair and ... fair skin . I " ve eradicated prejudicial conditions : Premature baldness , alcoholism , propensity for violence , obesity . We didn " t want ... Diseases , yes , but ... We would like to leave a few things to chance . Give your child the best start . We have enough imperfection built-in . Your child doesn " t need any additional burdens. lt " s still you . Simply the best of you . You could conceive naturally 1 , 000 times and never get such a result . That 's how Anton came to be . A son worthy of my father 's name . - l " m proud of you , son . - See how much he " s grown . When we played blood brothers l understood my blood was very different from Anton 's . I 'd need a lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere . We played chicken . When our parents weren 't watching we 'd swim as far out as we dared and see who 'd turn back first . Come on , you coward ! Of course it was always me . Anton was the stronger swimmer and had no excuse to fail . 300 million , 350 million , 400 million . Maybe it was my love of the planets orjust my dislike for this one , but for as long as I remember I 've dreamed of going into space . 750 million , 800 million , 850 million . How many astronauts are there ? I bet I could be one if I wanted . Don " t eat that. lt " s Pluto . My goals didn 't change a lot . Much to my parents ' dismay . Vincent ... Be realistic . With a heart condition like yours ... - There " s a chance my heart " s fine . - One chance in 1 00 . - l " ll take it . - They won " t . You " ve got to understand something . You " ll only get inside a spaceship to clean it . He was right. I lied on my resumé , but my real resumé was my cells . Why waste money on training me when there are 1 , 000 other applicants with a cleaner profile ? It is illegal to discriminate . " Genoism " , it 's called . But no one takes the law seriously . If you refuse to tell , they take a sample from a door handle or a handshake . Even the saliva on your application form . A legal drug test can become an illegal peek at your future in the company . Sure you want to do this ? You know you " re going to lose . It was the last time we swam together . Out into the open sea . Knowing each stroke out was one we 'd have to make back . But something was different . Every time Anton tried to pull away he found me right beside him . Until finally the impossible happened . Vincent ! For once in our lives Anton was not as strong as he believed and I was not as weak . That made everything else possible . Like others in my situation I moved around getting work where l could . I must 've cleaned half the toilets in the state . The underclass wasn 't determined by social status or skin colour now . - Welcome to Gattaca , gentlemen . - Today discrimination is a science . There " s your cleaning material . Start here and clean to the back . I want to see my smiling face on that floor . Dreaming of space , Your Majesty ? Come here . Start by cleaning this space . I knew how far away I was from my goal when I stood right beside it . - Don " t clean the glass too well . - What do you mean ? You might get ideas . But if the glass is clean , it " ll be easier to see me on the other side . I knew it was just brave talk . No matter how much I studied , the best test score in the world needs a blood test to match it . I had to go to extreme measures . The man who came didn 't exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages . Stand straight . - How did you hear about me ? - People . Any distinguishing marks ? Tattoos , scars , birth marks ? No . Are you serious about this ? I hope you " re not wasting my time . - l " d give 1 00 ° % . - That " ll get you halfway there . That " s an old edition , but I know it all by heart . - The commitment is binding . - You have somebody in mind ? For the genetic elite , success is attainable , but not guaranteed . There is no gene for fate . And when a member of the elite falls on hard times their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity . One man 's loss is another 's gain . He " s got impeccable credentials . An unbelievable expiration date . He " ll practically live forever . His lQ is off the register . Better than 20 / 20 vision . Strong heart . He could run through a wall . If he could still run . He was a big-time swimming star . You could go anywhere with this guy " s DNA tucked under your arm . - You look so right together . - We don " t look anything alike . Nobody looks at photos today . Christ , you could have my face . - How do I explain the accident ? - lt happened out of the country . No one knows he broke his back . He " s still a fully productive citizen . - Just fill in his last year . - You " re a foreigner . They don " t care where you were born . Blood has no nationality . As long as it " s got what they want , it " s the only passport you " ll need . - Who lives up there ? - Well , I certainly don " t . The process of becoming him began . Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth . - lsn " t there another way ? - Surgery will leave scars . It " s contact lenses or a white cane . - Besides , the colour doesn " t match . - He " s right . My eyes are prettier . I take 25 ° % of all you make . If it fails , all this equipment must be returned in seven days . - And you lose your deposit . - Wait ! You said 20 ° % . - 20 ° % . - lt " s not negotiable . - l guess that " s it . - No . There " s still the height . How tall were you before the accident ? - His profile says he " s 6 " 1 " " . - l can wear lifts . Even with lifts you " re not that tall . So what ? No ... - We never discussed that . - l thought you were serious . I am. I " m not doing that . No . Now Jerome knew I was committed . I endured the pain by reminding myself that when I did stand up l 'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . Do you want to go dancing ? You had to be a right-hander . No one orders southpaws any more . Jerome Morrow. lt " s a nice name . - lt " s my name . - l can " t be you without it . What makes you think you can be me at all ? Look at this . - Look at it . - lt " s nice . - ls it real ? - Are you colour-blind ? It " s silver . Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium . With all I had going for me , I was still second best . Me ! So how do you expect to pull it off ? I don " t know , exactly . Your signature needs work . Soon we were put to the test . Jerome had the genes to get into Gattaca , but not the desire . - Do you really want to be in there ? - Not in there . Up there . - What " s up there ? - That " s want I want to see , Jerome . Call me Eugene . My middle name . If you " re going to be Jerome , you better start getting used to it . - l must go . Where " s my sample ? - ln the fridge . Door on the left . - Which pouch ? - Any of them . - You think I should test it ? - lf you like . - What " s wrong with the machine ? - You " ve been drinking again ! - l haven " t . - Christ , it " s eight in the morning ! This is no joke . My interview is in an hour ! - There " s more vodka than piss ! - l had half a glass to celebrate . - Friday " s will be all right . - There " s only Wednesday left . That " s the one . It " s not too late to back out . This is the last day you will be you and I will be me . Well ? - Congratulations . - What about the interview ? That was it . I got it . Of course you got it . Each day I would dispose of all my loose skin , nails and hair . To limit how much of my ln - Valid self I 'd leave in the Valid world . Eugene prepared samples of his body matter so I 'd pass for him . Urine for the substance tests . Blood for the security checks and vials filled with other traces . Eugene gave me his identity while I paid the rent and kept him in the style to which he 'd become accustomed . Eugene had never been called " utero " , " faith birth " , " ln - Valid " . As a " Valid " , he suffered under the burden of perfection . I was now a member of a new and detested segment of society . One of those who won 't accept their fate . A " borrowed ladder " . Or ... a " de-gene-erate " . In the guise of Jerome Morrow I 've risen quickly in Gattaca . Only one of the mission directors has come close to exposing me . He may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life . I think we can rule out suicide . Thank you . This will take a while . We may have to push things back . Irene , I want you to assist the investigators . - That would put me behind . - l appreciate your sacrifice . - l won " t lose my place in line ? - Your place is assured . So kindly inform the authorities we will cooperate in any way , although we can " t tolerate a major disruption . - Thank you , Irene . - Thank you , Director . - How will this affect the mission ? - We " ll go ahead as planned . The launch can only be this week . Tragic though this event may be , it hasn " t stopped the planets turning . - What happened ? - l " m going up . - End of the week . - That soon ? - What about the mission director ? - He " s dead . Are you serious ? They found him beaten so badly they had to check his name tag . You are serious . There " s nothing between us and ignition . I " m going up . - The man was murdered ? - l didn " t do it . - lt " ll be crawling with Hoovers . - l " ll handle the J . Edgars . What if they do find something ? I " ll be out of their jurisdiction . We have to get drunk immediately . Good evening , gentlemen. I hear you " re leaving us , Mr. Morrow . - We " re going to miss you . - You " ve opened the wine , I hope ? Pour yourself a glass , Cavendish . How old is the specimen ? - l kissed him five minutes ago . - l " ll see what I can do . - You want the full sequence ? - Yes . Good luck . - 9.3 . Quite a catch . - Yes . Quite a catch . God , I " ve told Cavendish ... This has only been open five minutes ! Wine needs to breathe . They say being weightless is the closest thing to being in the womb . I can " t believe you pulled this off . They " re sending you up there . Up there ! You , of all people . You " ll be alone in that room for a year . - lt " s bigger than your tin can . - What are you going to do ? I have my books . I travel in my head . I wish you had company . Someone you didn " t have to pay for . - l wouldn " t have it any other way . - What are you going to do ? I " m going to finish this . What " s Titan like this time of year ? What " s Titan like ? Titan is exactly like this . The cloud around it is so thick , no one can tell what " s underneath . - Maybe there " s nothing there . - There " s something there . - You should be going , not me . - Why is that ? Because up there your legs wouldn " t matter . I " m scared of heights . I " m sorry . Do you want this ? I " ll save some for you , shall I ? I " m so sorry . I " m really , really sorry . Don " t give me a hard time . Give me a break . - Come on ! Help ! - l " m sorry . I wasn " t drunk ... ... when I walked in front of that car . I stepped right out in front of it . I " d never been more sober , ever . - Go to sleep . - l couldn " t even get that right . If at first you don " t succeed , try , try again . Go to sleep . I " m proud of you , Vincent . You must be drunk to call me Vincent . - How much do you need ? - 20 minutes . You can go . It " s all right , Irene . You " re excused . We found our man. lt " s the only specimen we can " t account for . - Every 1 0 years things go our way . - Tell me about the eyelash . An unregistered ln-Valid . A janitor . He disappeared a few years back . - The specimen could be from then . - Nothing lies around here for long . Would a janitor come back after so long to kill a man he never knew ? His profile suggests he " s violent . It also suggests he " s a sick man . There " s a 90 ° % chance he " s dead . That leaves a 1 0 ° % chance he " s still alive . The owner of the eyelash is the murderer. I " ll do a cross-check ... - He has no living relatives . - That " s a damn shame , sir . Check the entry log . Alibis , grudges . I see a lot of dry eyes . The mission director was not universally loved . He was leading cutbacks in the programme . With all due respect , sir ... Whatever you say . Jerome the metronome . I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his . - We have a suspect . - That is a relief . Who is he ? We found an unaccounted-for specimen . Here " s his picture . - An ln-Valid . - We " re still following other leads . - l " m posting this immediately . - l " m curious , Director . An advantage , I should imagine , in your line of work . - Your hiring practices ... - Our " " recruitment philosophy " " . - Who do you have to be , to be here ? - We don " t take common citizens . Are they all equally excellent ? Occasionally we " ve had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings . But nothing that would stop them joining the police , for example . Now , there are enough of the right kind to warrant a new standard . Bodies with minds to match . Essential , as we push out further . - Yet you still monitor performance . - To see they meet their potential . - And exceeding it ? - No one exceeds his potential . If he did , we just didn " t accurately gauge his potential right off . - All right ? - Terrific . The entry log for the past week . What about you , Irene ? Do you have an alibi ? - l was alone . - l find that hard to believe . I " ll take care of that for you , Mr. Morrow . I see I " m not the only one who looks up every time there " s a launch . - lt " s awful about the director . - Awful it didn " t happen sooner . Didn " t he threaten to cancel your mission ? Somebody did you a favour . - Do they know who I should thank ? - They found an eyelash . - Does it have a name ? - Just some ln-Valid . Jerome ... I had you sequenced . I read your profile . I " m sorry . Seems you " re everything they say you are and more . You " re engineered just like the rest of us . Not quite . " " Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure . " " That " s how they put it . The only trip I " ll take in space is around the sun on this satellite . If there " s anything wrong with you , I can " t see it from where l stand . If you don " t believe me ... Here . Take it . If you " re still interested , let me know . I " m sorry . The wind caught it . Please check the latest Gattaca bulletin . Jerome. ls this the approach path we discussed ? - Absolutely , Director . - Quite right . Listen , I want what I ordered . It " s a completely different colour . No. I " m bored of talking to you . I " ll call you back . That was about your hair dye . They " ve sent me " " Summer Wheat " " . It " s too light . " " Why don " t you try a change ? " " We can " t use it ! - l " ll probably have to pay for it . - We can " t stay here . - The idiots I have to deal with . . ! - They think I killed the director . - What makes them think that ? - They found my eyelash . - Where ? - ln the corridor . Thank God it wasn " t in your eye . My picture is everywhere. I can " t turn around without seeing my face . - They " ll recognize me . They will ! - l don " t recognize you . They won " t accept one of their elite could " ve suckered them for so long . No , we do as we planned . You " re Jerome Morrow , Navigator 1 st Class . I " m not Jerome Morrow . I " m a murder suspect . What are you doing ? That " s more than a day " s worth ! - We can " t stay here . - Stop that ! Fine ... fine ! Leave if you want . But don " t take that stuff. lt " s mine ! I would " ve chosen a brave partner if I " d known you " d go belly-up on me at the last gasp . You can " t quit on me now . Do you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself ? - They are going to find me . - You still don " t understand ... When they look at you , they don " t see you any more . Only me . Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong . How could you be so careless ? - l " m going out . - Where ? I want some fun before they nail me . - Are you sure that " s a good idea ? - You said not to change anything . - Who " s going ? - l " d say everybody . If I don " t go it " ll look suspicious . You don " t want to look suspicious , do you ? Thanks . Who ordered this ? What are we doing here ? I " m following a lead . Forgive me , but I " m a detective. I follow leads . - Why should the suspect be here ? - He " s an ln-Valid . - This is where the ln-Valids are . - He " s an ln-Valid . He " s been in hiding all these years . You think he " ll lie down for us now ? - What do you suggest ? - Go back to the scene . Sweep the area around Gattaca . - You " re a navigator ? At Gattaca ? - That " s what it says , doesn " t it ? - lt doesn " t say you " re crippled . - l hurt my leg training , you moron . How dare you question me ? What " s your number ? - Your number , you fucking flatfoot ! - What do you want ? An apology ? It gets to you that I can live your dreams. I " m leaving this dirtball ! - You " re harassing me ! - My mistake . What " s your number ? This is a crime scene . What " s this man doing here ? - What are you doing , old man ? - My job , sir . - This is evidence . - But it " s just trash . You didn " t know ? Wonderful , wasn " t it ? 1 2 fingers or 1 , it " s how you play . That piece can only be played with 1 2 . - What " s all this about ? - lt " s probably nothing . No. I don " t want to give you a contaminated specimen . Get it ? Thanks . You never know where those swabs have been . I want to show you something . Come on , we " ll miss it . Come on . We " ll miss it . What did I tell you ? Strange . Your eyes look different . - l guess it must be the light . - Must be . Positive match. I " m impressed . - The cup was used recently ? - Two samples , two days . He may have returned to the crime scene to get a drink of water . - Or he may still work there . - We checked all the service staff . I don " t think he cleans any more . I think he " s there in disguise . - A borrowed ladder at Gattaca ? - Far-fetched , but not impossible . He can " t be among the elite . He " s mentally and physically inferior . Maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out . Let " s sample every employee intravenously . We " d close them down for days . No , take a fingertip or a urine sample . I suggest blood from the vein . I hope I " m not out of line . It " s only a matter of time , sir . What " s with the plungers , Lamar ? You open up a blood bank ? The detectives fear my methods may have been compromised . - Goddamn ! Are you out of practice ? - Let me look at that . - lt " s all right . - Luckily , we have enough . If you need any more , you can get it off his shoes . Irene . - So you didn " t do it after all ? - l guess someone beat me to it . I guess . I leave in two days . I guess you know that . But ... That " s the last . - Something " s wrong . - He " s not here . - l say we test again . - No . No more disruptions . - You have a murderer in your midst . - Your presence is more of a threat . The window for our latest launch is open for seven days every 70 years . - lt " s crucial we leave on time . - This mission means a lot to you . Your late colleague opposed it . Take another look at my profile . I haven " t a violent bone in my body . My apologies . He won " t trouble you any further . This is not the only place we can look . Let " s start making the rounds . I " m luckier than most . Not as lucky as some . - l know something about that . - What heart problem have you had ? Did you get yours broken once ? I had this crazy idea you were more interested in the murder than in me . You " re right . That " s a crazy idea . Would you like to dance ? It " s funny . You work so hard to get away from a place ... And when you finally get to leave , you find a reason to stay . - A year is a long time . - Not so long . Just once around the sun . Hello , I " m your detective for the evening . Please stay here . Don " t leave ! Am I speaking in some strange foreign language ? Check lenses , dentures , napkins , cigarette butts , saliva off cups . That " s a familiar face . Check him out . - l thought you wanted to dance . - Where are you going ? Jerome ! - Are you insane ? - Come on ! Where did they go ? Come on . - l can " t do that ! - You just did . Don " t touch your face . Don " t swallow . Clean his teeth . Vincent ! Vincent ! Who " s Vincent ? I ... Don " t say anything . Don " t say anything . What happened ? The scars on your legs ? Remember the " 99 Chrysler LeBaron ? I bumped into the front fender . Looked left instead of right . - ls that the new or the old excuse ? - The old one . - You are involved with the murder . - That " s not true , Irene . Isn " t that the man from last night ? He " s nobody . He " s one of our best . He has nothing to do with this business . Jerome Morrow . You don " t look well , Jerome . Why don " t you go home ? - Yes ? - Jerome Morrow . He " s ill . A little nausea . It " s quite common before a mission . I want to visit him. I understand you can show me the way . You don " t know who he is , do you ? - Hello ? - Be yourself today . - l was never very good at it . - Tell the investigators you " re ill . - How long have I got ? - Not long . I guess he " s not home . - l " m here to see Jerome Morrow . - That " s me . Come up . I guess he " s home . Come in . Come in . Come in . Hello , sweetheart . Where " s my kiss ? - Good to see you " re feeling better . - Of course , now that you " re here . Who " s your friend ? How can I help ? - lt " s about the director . - Again ? - l hope it " s no trouble . - No , no . - l won " t show you around . Sorry . - Can " t we do this another time ? - This won " t take a moment . - Maybe he can tell me why I " m ill . Who were you expecting ? - We have our man in custody . - l " ll come right away . - How are you , Jerome ? - Not bad , Jerome . - How the hell did you get up here ? - l can walk. I " ve been faking it . Irene ... Don " t touch me ! I don " t even know who you are . - l " m the same as I was yesterday . - No more lies , Jerome . My name is Vincent Anton Freeman . I " m a faith birth or a de-gene-erate or whatever . But I " m not a murderer . - You " re a God-child ? - We do have one thing in common . Only I don " t have 20-30 years left in mine. lt " s 1 0,000 beats overdue . - lt " s not possible . - You know what isn " t possible . Don " t you , Irene ? They " ve got you looking so hard for any flaw , that that " s all you see . For whatever it " s worth , I " m here to tell you that it is possible . It is possible . Congratulations , sir . His spit was found in the dead director " s eye . While I obsessed over an eyelash , your instincts pointed the way . So the ln-Valid wasn " t involved ? No , our friend acted alone . This mission meant everything to him . He " ll only live to see this launch . Since nothing can stop the launch now , he " s very , very cooperative . - So , will you celebrate tonight ? - Of course . - l think she likes us . - ln time she " ll get used to it . - What was he like ? - Just a cop . - Did you get his name ? - No . - He " ll be back . - They have their man. lt " s over . No , it " s not. I have to meet him . Vincent ? My God , you have changed . - Don " t you recognize your brother ? - Are we brothers ? Our parents died thinking they " d outlived you. I had my doubts . - What are you doing here ? - l have a right to be here . - You don " t . - You sound as if you believe that . I committed no murder . You must be disappointed . You committed fraud . You " re in trouble. I can get you out of here . - l " ve struggled to get here ! - You " ve gone as far as you can go . There " s still a million miles to go . Can you only succeed by seeing me fail ? God ! Even you are going to tell me what I can and can " t do now ? I don " t need any rescuing . But you did , once . - How do you explain that ? - You didn " t beat me. I beat myself . - Who are you trying to convince ? - Do you want me to prove it ? It " s not important , Anton . It " s forgotten . I " ll prove it to you . Do you want me to prove it ? I do . Vincent ! Vincent ! Where " s the shore ? We " re too far out ! Do you want to quit ? Do you ? No . Vincent ! How are you doing this , Vincent ? How have you done any of this ? We have to go back . - No . We " re close to the other side . - Do you want to drown us both ? You want to know how I did it ? This is how I did it. I never saved anything for the swim back . You couldn " t see , could you ? That night , crossing the street . You crossed anyway . If you " re still interested , let me know . Sorry ... The wind caught it . You " re flying today , aren " t you ? Look at what a mess you " re in . - l have your samples ready . - l don " t need any where l " m going . You might when you get back . Everything you need to last you two lifetimes . - Why have you done all this ? - So Jerome will always be here . - Where are you going ? - l " m travelling , too . - l don " t know how to thank you . - No , no ... I got the better end of the deal . I only lent you my body . You lent me your dream . Not until you " re upstairs . - What is this ? - New policy . - Flight got you nervous ? - There " s a problem , Lamar . I never did tell you about my son , did I ? He " s a big fan of yours . Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most . - He wants to apply here . - l could have gone up and back . Unfortunately , my son " s not all that they promised . But then , who knows what he could do ? Right ? For future reference , right-handed men don " t hold it with their left . Just one of those things . You " re going to miss your flight , Vincent . For someone who was never meant for this world , l 'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it . Of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star . Maybe I 'm not leaving . Maybe I 'm going home .

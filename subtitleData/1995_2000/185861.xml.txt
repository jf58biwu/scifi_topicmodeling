 Good evening . - It 's 3 : 30 a.m. - Good morning ! - I thought we 'd have a party . - I 'm expecting visitors . Perhaps I 'm intruding . You 're not intruding . I 've just come from an embassy junket . The rattle of ambassadorial decorations , the drone of speeches . all proceeding at the pace of an infiirm , gravely debilitated , very old snail . - Why the midnight vigil ? - I 'm expecting Bobby Danvers . - Courier ? What 's he couriering ? - Top secret papers from you know where . - Hot stuff ? - I 've laid out my asbestos gloves . He should have been here nearly two hours ago . Wait ! He hasn 't got the box . - He must have ditched it on the way here . - and now he 's going into Steed 's place . We 've got to know what happens in there . We 've got to hear what 's being said . But if it was an ordinary delay , he would have telephoned . Not necessarily . Personal contact only . That 's one of the rules of the job . If Danvers had ... They didn 't get the box . Hid it . I hid it . Confused the trail . Treasure chest . Red treasure chest . - all right ? - Should be loud and clear . It doesn 't make sense . He hid the box in the red treasure chest . That doesn 't tell us much . How did he arrive in the country ? By plane . Do you know where he landed ? a small airfiield just outside London . Then let 's trace the route he took . That might tell us something . Spread them out on the desk . - Were you asleep ? - No , of course I wasn 't asleep . What 's been happening ? a van came up and took Danvers ' body away . - anything else ? - No . That 's all . a registered parcel for you . It 's the postman . Thank you . - How are we doing ? - Not very well . Even if he came here direct , it still means 35 miles of country roads . - aren 't you going to open it ? - I know what it is . - Lead weights for your diving boots ? - Rock cakes from my auntie Penelope . " George Benstead requests the pleasure of John Steed at his annual car rally . " - Who 's George Benstead ? - I have no idea but here 's a key . For the treasure chest ? Those are Danvers ' fiingerprints . - The rally starts at High Pines , Edginton . - That 's about 15 miles from here . There . Car rally . Must be the right place . This way , sir , madam . Mr. Benstead is waiting to welcome you . One minute thirty-fiive ! Best time of the day . Mr. Steed and guest , sir . Do forgive fiinding me like this . I do enjoy a little run , though . So exhilarating . How good of you to come . Forgive me , but I can 't recall where we met . This is Mrs. Emma Peel . - What a beauty . - I do agree . Marvellous chassis . I wouldn 't be quite so bold as to say that but ... Her suspension 's pretty complex , too . That ! The simulator . all the controls are geared to the fillm . One mistake and the bell rings . - You mean you 've crashed ? - Metaphorically speaking , yes . Would you care for a run ? No , thank you . Steed 's the one who likes the big toys . Capital ! Splendid ! In you get , then ! Fits me like a glove . I 'll adjust the lap speed about halfway . Shall we say 80 miles an hour 'til you get used to it ? Right . I bet Bobby enjoyed this . - Bobby ? - Bobby Danvers . - He was a friend of yours . - Watch that corner ! Tricky ! Get into a four-wheel drift and you 've had it ! There 's something wrong with your electrics ! Dear me . I forgot to warn you . When you make a mistake , you get a mild shock . So I see ! Gingers one up , no end , eh ? " End " is right ! - Quite an experience . - Electrifying . a stop at the pitch is indicated . Little drink before the others arrive . What a very good idea ! a little pit stop . Excellent . Rather interesting prints here . Picked them up very cheaply . High-octane stuff ? Exactly . But all non-alcoholic , of course . No problems about driving afterwards . Cheers . What 's this ? Gin and Maserati ? Very amusing . Beg your pardon ! They put the super in the standard ! - Did you get them ? - Only just . Mrs. Peel jumped me . You didn 't see it . She 's well and truly emancipated ! anyway , you got them ! So we 're in ! Of course , I never married . Wedded to my cars , instead . - Distinct advantages . - You can switch a car off . That 's it , exactly . Tell me , isn 't there something missing in this room ? If my memory serves me correctly , didn 't you used to have a red treasure chest ? That 's really rich ! a red treasure chest ! - You 'd like to see it now , I suppose ? - as a matter of fact , I would . Some more guests have arrived . Treasure chest . There 's no sign of the treasure chest , but we 're in the right place . I ran into some trouble . Somebody was ransacking Benstead 's study . - Did they get anything ? - Not as far as I could tell . a couple of invitations ! Blank ones . - Not going to be easy . This crowd . - Provides a perfect cover . Helps to confuse things . Besides , we are holding the ace . We know the opposition . Ladies and gentlemen . If you 'll give me your attention , please ! It 's time to drawfor partners . Partners ? Certainly . Driving partners . Mr. George Townsend . Miss Margaret Brady . Miss Penelope Plain . Here ! Terribly sorry I 'm late , darling ! I had such trouble with my clutch control ! You 'll be accompanying Mr. John Steed . Who 's John Steed ? Here ! Darling , you 're with me ! I 'm so glad ! Because you remind me so much of dear David . - David ? - My fiiancé ! Then perhaps I should step aside , and your fiiancé can partner you . Silly ! David 's dead ! The poor dear fell into a buzz saw . He was terribly fond of carpentry ! I 've got to wriggle out of this somehow . We can 't go chasing off around the countryside . No , so you 'd better stay here and search . Seems they 've paired us off together . Major Mike Coburn . You look a good , keen navigating type . I do ? I want to make it clear right now . I mean to win this treasure hunt . Treasure hunt ? Well , of course ! Don 't tell me you didn 't know . It 's a car rally combined with a treasure hunt . Splendid fun ! Clues scattered along the route , each one leading you closer to the treasure . - The prize ! - The big prize . It 's worth 1,000 guineas this year . - Rich pickings . - I must check my motor . I 'll get you ladies a drink . Tell me about your clutch control . Really , my dear chap . I 'm shocked ! Deeply shocked ! You do know where the treasure 's hidden ? Naturally ! I 'm the only one who does ! I hid it myself ! To come right out and ask me where I 've hidden it ... You have all the appearance of a gentleman , too ! I 'm not interested in the 1,000 guineas ! Of course not ! Just want to know where it 's hidden , that 's all ! This is important ! a friend of mine has hidden something in your treasure chest , wherever it is . I can 't tell you any more . You 'll have to trust me . as a gesture of good faith , I 'll double the prize money if you tell me where it is ! Double it ! More than that , I 'm willing ... Look out ! What are you doing ? - I was throwing the switches . - So I saw ! Please , we have guests . Someone had altered them to full voltage . Very dangerous . - There could 've been a nasty accident . - There already has ! Just come and look in here ! Dead ? I didn 't touch him . If you didn 't and I didn 't . Who did ? Isn 't it time we were all away ? Tell Mr. Benstead that we 're ready . I 'm panting at the leash ! Go on as if nothing had happened . Mr. Benstead is feeling ill . He 'll watch the start from his bedroom window . Mr. Benstead is ... I sincerely hope so . Take your partners , please . The rally is about to commence . I 've got mine ! Please don 't open it yet . You know , there 's something " Paul " about you . - Paul ? - My second fiiancé . Poor love . Insisted on surveying mountains by air . Popped up in his helicopter and then his " whirly things ... " - ... bumped against a glacier . - Did he come down ? Very rapidly . Your fiirst clue . Don 't open it yet . Ladies and gentlemen . The fiirst clue is sealed in your envelope . When I give the signal , run to your cars read the clue and then off you go . Remember , I shall be watching you . I am the scrutineer . Ready , steady ... - No , you drive . - Thank you . What are you doing ? You 're supposed to be with me ! We haven 't got a clue ! What 's the fiirst clue ? The vaults at Mithering ! - The vaults at Mithering ? - That 's what it says ! My fiiancé had a car like this . Poor Harold ! My third fiiancé . Divine man ! Cross-channel swimmer . One day , he had this super idea of swimming it both ways ! Underwater ! Poor Harold . He simply had no sense of direction . . It 's a short skirt ! I mean , a shortcut ! Shortcut ! Should put us a good 10 minutes ahead . any more good ideas ? So much for your shortcut ! This is the vaults at Mithering . Do you think they 're bank vaults ? That wouldn 't be a problem if we had dear albert here . - Fiancé number ... - Four . Or was it fiive ? albert was always blowing things up . Went all over the world just demolishing things . Is that so ? It must mean something ! Let 's try over here . The last thing he blew up was a bridge . Only he was so absent-minded ! Poor albert ! He set the charges and then ... - ... forgot to get off ! - See what 's on that sign ! Get in the car ! We 're ahead now . Got to make sure that we stop ahead . I shall make sure . The next fast stretch . This is it ! Bombs away ! Look out ! Lucky . We missed them . I doubt if anyone else will . - Don 't you think we should ... - No time ! Look out ! That reminded me of a bobsleigh run I did with Henry V. - Henry V ? - My fiifth . I was thrown clear , but poor Henry ... He really should 've been wearing a crash helmet ! Don 't you think ? Someone 's awfully keen on winning , aren 't they ? another shortcut ? This one 's more reliable . It should put us fiive minutes ahead of anyone else . By the time I 'm fiinished , maybe more than fiive minutes . Winning tactics ? - By hook ... - Or by crook . anything ? Not a thing ! We 're still ahead . Hold it ! That should upset somebody . Fool ! Somebody must have changed that other sign before we got there ! Somebody 's cheated ! Not my fault . People are dishonest ! They 're ahead of us now ! - We 'll just turn around and go back ! - No ! Take that road ! This is Swingingdale . Not very swinging . " Get a move on . " That was the clue . " Get a move on . " - " The village of Galding . " - Get on ! - " The village of Galding . " - " Mr. Smith 's Hammer . " I 've always been fascinated by men of action ! Men who get up and go ! Sounds as though most of them got up and went ! I 've had rather a run of bad luck . There was that parachutist , for instance . Desperate to break the record for a delayed drop ! - and did he ? - He broke it , all right . But unfortunately , his neck as well . " Mr. Smith 's Hammer " ? What do you think it means ? Smith and Hammer . What does that conjure up to you ? a blacksmith ! Mr. Smith 's hammer ? Hammer ! Look ! " Barrels ... " ... of fun at Treetop Farm . " - Come on ! - Wait ! But Mrs. Peel 's ahead of us ! and Steed is right behind us . Can 't be too far behind . This will narrow down the opposition . Not a word . Over there ! Quick ! Look what I found . It 's supposed to be lucky . Take this thing off me ! Quickly , you fool ! Careful ! It is supposed to be lucky . We have to get them . They can 't be far ahead . - lf we could only get at the treasure . - They can 't get far . - I sugared their petrol . - You what ? It isn 't exactly that I wanted to cheat . although 1,000 guineas would buy a lot of hats . But I am so used to giving sugar lumps to horses and cars are sort of horses , aren 't they ? When I sawthat lonely little car standing there , sugarless I just naturally ... That put pay to the opposition . From now on , it 's plain sailing ! " Penny " plain sailing ? They told me this windscreen was bullet-proof . There 's a farm ! Bottom of the hill ! On the other side of the wood ! - The others ? - Nothing in sight . We 're way ahead of the fileid . - Where do we start ? - Your guess is as good as mine . " Barrels of fun . " I 'll start here . You try the other ones ! . " Barrels of fun " ! " Back at my place . What a shocking place to hide the treasure ! " any luck ? - Yes . In the storeroom I found ... - You found ? a barrel with something written on the bottom of it . The clue , I think ! It 's too heavy for me ! You can 't miss it . The one nearest the window ! are you all right ? I think so . Mike Coburn . He 's an impostor . You must stop him getting the treasure . Sure you 're all right ? Don 't worry . I 'll stop him . Where do we start ? Explain . Have you ever woken up and realised it wasn 't going to be one of your days ? Then I saw Coburn shoot at you , and I followed him here . That 's when he attacked me . and then Mrs. Peel arrived . - Where 's Mrs. Peel now ? - She drove back towards the house . Nice bit of driving . Bates wouldn 't tell me where the treasure was . Maybe you will . You 're such a splendid driver ! almost as good as Edward . - another fiiancé ? - He went off on safari . Determined to bag a rhinoceros . It bagged him . You are being stubborn . That 's a pity . You see , I haven 't much time ! No time for fiinesse or gentle persuasion . The fiinal clue ! You will tell me the fiinal clue ! Better concentrate on the road ! Just a mild shock at the moment . Nothing to worry about . Let 's push the speed up , shall we ? and increase the voltage ! The next shock won 't be so pleasant . I hate to tell you , but that opposition you lost ... I keep telling you , there 's nothing here to interest you ! Come on now ! I 've no loyalties ! I sell to the highest bidder . I keep my ears and eyes open . When I saw you and Steed go off on a treasure hunt with the opposition trailing you , then there 's got to be something in it for me . It 's obviously not going fast enough . The fiinal clue ! What is it ? They 're gaining ! Talk ! What about ? The weather ? This is going to be very unpleasant for you soon ! Now ! On the right ! Get up beside them ! again ! Try ! On the side ! Road hogs ! . Where is it ? My patience is wearing thin ! It 's all or nothing now ! - It will be nothing if you kill me ! - I 'm a gambler ! I play the long odds ! No , don 't fiire her now ! You can 't afford one slip , one mistake . Tell me where it is and you 're free ! You stay here . - Be careful ! I don 't want to lose you , too . - Let 's just stay good friends ! You do realise that in a few moments you 're likely to die ! I say , you 're awfully good at it ! Switch it off ! I warn you , I 'm simply hopeless at mechanical things ! I 've done it ! Don 't touch me ! It 's no good ! It just keeps going round and round ! I 've just been introduced to a rarity from Reeves ... The voltage control ! - The voltage control ? - Yes ! I disconnected it ! You what ? Each grape individually crushed ! So that 's how you do it . The custom is to toast the glorious victor . What about the treasure ? The fiinal clue was , " What a shocking place to hide the treasure . " " What a shocking place to hide the treasure . " You 're warm . Very cold . Getting warmer . Warmer . Sizzling hot . Open sesame . Treasure trove . Finders ... keepers . There we are . Look ! Super ! Consolation prize . Latest thing . an exceptionally powerful motor . Exceptionally . Do you have to pass a test to use it ? Bit noisy , isn 't it ? I said , it 's a bit noisy ! You can 't have economy in silence ! 5,000 shaves to the gallon . One million whiskers , service once yearly . Fast down the straights , four forward speeds and reverse . What does reverse do ? Nowthat you mention it , I haven 't the slightest idea ! Reverse . are you ready ?

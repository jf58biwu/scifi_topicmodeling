 Wait , wait , wait . Stop , stop ! Right here . This is it . Nice job , Broots . Can you even spell " map " ? No , we 're not lost , Miss Parker . The G. P. S. coordinates Jarod gave us ... say it 's right around here . About , uh , 25 yards ... that way ! This should be it . This should be it , right here . This is it ! This is it ! - All right ! I 'm way past the point of losing patience with Jarod 's little games . This is a waste of time . If he brought us here , there must be a reason . Yeah . To make us feel like asses traipsing around Kansas all day . Well , uh , actually , Miss Parker , I don 't think we 're in Kansas anymore . What 'd you say ? - Well , based on this map ... we just crossed the state line right there . No . Exactly what did you just say ? I said , " I don 't think we 're in Kansas anymore . " What 's that there ? A brick . A yellow brick ... With an address on it . I get it . Follow the yellow brick road . - Very good , Broots . I love that story . - Either of you munchkins ... break into song , I 'll drop a house on ya . Let 's go find out what our little flying monkey is up to . Well , I see that the slop on a shingle ... seemed to work out all right after all . I am sorry about the misunderstanding . But with the name and all , well ... I thought it had something to do with the biological function of a pig . I 'm just kinda glad that I didn 't suggest the red-eyed gravy . Oh . Oh . Do you have a restroom ? - For customers only . I 'll take a doughnut . Excuse me . Is everything all right ? - Yeah . Peachy . I mean , if there 's something I can do ? - Damn it ! Thanks . It was just a kiss , sweetheart . - Maybe I can help you . Getting out of the way would be a start . - That guy didn 't seem friendly . You 're a great kisser , but if you don 't shut the door , I 'm gonna have to hurt you . Shut the door ! There . It 's shut . Not what I had in mind ... but we 're gonna have to go with it . He 's wearing a badge . You 're on the run from the police ? Nah , we 're on the run from the police . How 's it feel to be a wanted man ? There are Pretenders among us . I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because ofwhat I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . You a doctor ? - I am today . You could have told me you were on the run from the police . I don 't remember beggin' you to get in the car . I thought you needed help . I appreciate the whole Dudley Do-Right thing , but you 're a little out of your league . What are you ? Insurance , banker , what ? Stock analyst . At least I was . - Uh-huh . Family man , too , I bet . A couple of kids , a pretty little wife . Drive ' em to soccer practice in the S. U. V. The best thing you can do is turn yourself in . Look , you can relax , all right ? I 'm not on the run from the cops . I 'm on the run from a cop . Singular . That charming guy back at the diner was Vince , my ex-boyfriend . He 's not takin ' the breakup real well . You 're trying to tell me that that cop was in love with you ? What can I say ? I 'm a hell of a catch . Where are you headed ? - Nowhere . Anywhere . Somewhere 's right up the road . Drop you off ? I suppose we 'd probably wig out the wife if I drove up to your front door . Well , I don 't have a wife . A home either , for that matter . Where you headed ? - Nowhere . Anywhere . I already been somewhere . Well , I 'm going east , so I guess that 's where we 're headed . You can ride if you want to . It might be nice if I knew your name , though . Jarod . - Nice to meet you , Jarod . I 'm Zoe . You 're sure this is the place , Broots ? Well , the address matches the brick . Is it me , or has Oz been seriously rezoned ? Yeah ? - Hi . We 're looking for ... who the hell knows . Jarod sent us . - Oh . You must be Dorothy . Hold on a minute . - If she 's Dorothy ... that makes us , what , the Lion and the Tin Man ? You 're Toto at best , Broots . Hello ? - Down here . Don 't tell me . You represent - - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Just get inside before I air-condition the whole damn world . I guess the Wizard forgot to pay the light bill . Here . Here . You know what to do . Follow , follow , follow , follow . It just keeps getting better . Hey ! Open up the door ! - Not without the magic words ! Parker , I 'm sure we 'll get out of here when Jarod intends us to . If I only had a brain . Come on . Lemonade , 50 cents . - Check it out . God , how many times did we do that when we were kids ? - Lemonade , 50 cents . They 're awfully young to be running a business . - It 's a lemonade stand . Are you telling me you and your friends never did that ? Every kid does that . - Not every kid . Lemonade . Hey , guys . How 's business ? - Not so good . Maybe your luck is changing . My friend and I have been driving for a while ... and we 're really thirsty . Isn 't that right , Jarod ? - Oh , yeah . We 're parched . How much ? Fifty cents a glass . Oh , we 're a lot thirstier than that . We might need the whole pitcher . - Mm-hmm . You think that 'll cover it ? Mom ! Mother ! Mom ! - Two hundred dollars ? I just remember when my sister Katie and I used to do this . We 'd start out dreamin' we 'd make a ton of money , and , of course , that would never happen . I guess I just wanted to see what a dream come true looks like . Sounds like you had a good childhood . Yeah . About a million years ago . Cheers . - Cheers . Of course , when we made it , we actually put sugar in it . Mmm . I think it 's perfect . Jarod , you scare me . You comin ' ? - Yes . Sing it ! - I don 't know it . Hey , there 's a tape case in the back . Grab something ' that looks good . You don 't know it ? This looks interesting . You want to tell me about it ? What 's to tell ? I don 't like writin ' out checks . That 's not a crime , is it ? - Come on . A box full of cash ? That cop back at the diner ? - I already told you about him . Why don 't you tell me the truth ? What 'd you do , rob a bank ? You know , screw you , Jarod . The only thing I 'm guilty of ... is staying too long in a lousy relationship . Oh , with the cop , right ? - That 's right . Except Vince didn 't know how to leave the authority figure thing at home ... so for two years , I put up with him beating ' the crap out of me . It might be two years too late , but at least I finally walked out . This is every bit of savings I had . So there . That 's my happy little tale . I 'm 30 years old , and my whole life is two suitcases ... $ 27,000 and a ' 62 Ford . I kinda missed out on happily ever after . Zoe , I 'm sorry . You know , whatever . Look , it 's been real fun , but when we reach the next town ... I 'll drop you off where you can catch a bus . Can I help you ? Yes . When does the next bus come through here ? Oh , uh , hold on a second . I got a schedule here some place . Twenty-one to Dispatch . Possible on female A. P. B. out of Warrington . Pennsylvania plates . Edward Baker David 6233 . Roger , 21 . Suspect wanted for assault and armed robbery . Apprehend with caution . Well , you 've either got real good luck or real bad . The next westbound doesn 't get here till 7 : 45 tonight . But if you 're headed eastbound , well , here comes the 1 : 30 right now . Pretty little thing . I wonder what she did to deserve that . Me too . So , am I gonna sell you a ticket ? No . My plans have changed . Come on . You 're being jerked around . I didn 't steal anything from anyone . Ma 'am , we got an A. P. B. on the police wire . If it 's a mistake , you can clear it up back in Warrington . I won 't get back to Warrington . Haven 't you heard anything I 've just said ? Your ride should be here any minute . - It 's , uh , here now . Jarod Malloy , Warrington P. D. Oh , I see you got my perp here . Malloy ? I was told an Officer Hudono was comin ' to get her . Oh , yeah . Vince . He smacked into ... the chief 's brand new Lexus on the way out of the parking lot . Ow . - He 's gonna be patchin' up his butt for a while ... so I 'm covering ' for him . I just want to go home . You got your PP-3 form ? Uh , uh , uh ... Damn it ! No , I must have left it in Vince 's car . We really can 't release her without it . Can you help me out here ? It 's my daughter 's 10th birthday party tonight . I really want to get back in time for it . Why don 't you let me take my perp , and then I 'll fax you back the PP-3 form ? Yeah , well , allright . I don 't want you to miss your daughter 's party . Thanks . I owe you one . Hey , where you goin ' ? - I parked out back . That is absolutely the most incredible thing anyone 's ever done for me . Vince is coming through the front door . Get in the car . You have my car , my money . You could have taken everything and disappeared . How did you know I was telling the truth about Vince ? I could 've made that stuff up . Jarod ! How did you know ? - Because you told me . Now get in the car . You 're a fugitive now . Drive , cowboy ! Hey ! Hey , Zoe ! Jarod , I think it 's time you tell me the truth . The truth about what ? - You 're obviously not a stock analyst . You make a pretty convincing cop , but that 's not it either . So , who are you really ? I 'm just someone who 's looking for a little happily ever after myself . I 'm searching for my family . I got separated from them when I was a kid . I 'm separated from my family too . By choice . I ran away when I was 16 . I can 't imagine having a family and not wanting to be with them . Don 't you miss them ? - My grandmother , I do a lot . She 's the only one who ever really understood me . But the others ? I don 't really think about them . Except , of course , my sister Katie . Let me tell you something about identical twins . They 're not . Katie got all the brains ... the talent , the sense of humor . No one ever had any trouble telling us apart . There . That should keep Vince off our backs . The state line is about an hour east ofhere . After that , you 'll be free and clear . We 're not gonna go east anymore . A new plan . We 're goin ' north . To where ? - I 'm gonna teach you ... about another childhood staple I 'm pretty sure you missed out on . The road trip . - The road trip ? Yeah . Distilled to its most basic essence ... it is loading up on junk food ... crankin ' the radio and ... just drivin ' . Okay , joke 's over . What the hell are we supposed to be finding ? Maybe Jarod wants us to run like rats in a maze . Oh , yeah . Or a fun house . That would imply having fun . What 's that light down there ? Great . We go on the yellow brick road death march ... and all we find is this Goodwill reject ? Hey , that 's G. I. Joe . One of your " don 't ask , don 't tell " buddies ? I had one just like this when I was a kid . He had the same jungle fatigues , the same fake scar . Oh . - What is it ? There 's a letter " B " carved in the boot . But mine had a " B. " I carved it with Kenny Golletti 's pocket knife . You 're saying this is your doll ? - It couldn 't be . Could it ? - We have entered the Jarod Zone . G. I. Joe was my best friend . When I was 12 , I got the measles . I spent all summer in the hospital . I almost died . You know , none of my friends could visit me . And then my brother , he snuck me in my G. I. Joe . And it reminded me of home , of my room ... where everything was so much better . Yeah , I know it sounds crazy ... but this little guy saved my life that summer . You never mentioned this story before , Broots . Well , I never even thought of it before . Until ... - Till Jarod reminded you . What do you think ? Too ick ? Not ick at all . You look beautiful . Why the change ? - Mmm . Would , uh , you bewilling to pretend for me again ? Okay , okay . Anytime you want to fill me in on what 's going on here ... Zoe ! Oh , I can 't believe it 's you ! Hi , Grandma . - Oh , sweetie , it 's so good to see you ! I can 't tell you the time I 've spent worrying that somethin ' might have happened to you . Something has happened to me . There 's someone I want you to meet . This is Jarod . - Hi . My husband . You 're gonna love him , Grandma . He 's sweet and kind and spoils me almost as much as you used to . Oh , well , you picked a perfect time to surprise me . Your sister Linda and her husband are here . Come on in and share the good news . Let 's go share the good news , honey . Linda , you 'll never guess who 's here . Your baby sister , and she 's a newlywed . Hey , Linda . - Wow . Well , that 's ... great . Um , congratulations . Uh , Linda is my sister . And , uh , this is ... That 's my husband , Greg . Zoe should know that , but since she couldn 't be bothered ... to come to our wedding , they 've never met . Who wants coffee ? I 'm not sure if you care ... but Mom 's still chairing the ladies ' group at the club ... and , uh , Mark and his wife just had their second boy in June . Mark 's our brother . - I swear , he hasn 't had a minute to rest . He 's taken over the firm from Dad . It 's been such a success . They must have 20 partners now . So , what do you do , Jarod ? - Hmm ? Uh , a little bit of this , a little bit of that . Oh , don 't be so modest , honey . Jarod 's an aerospace engineer . He designs commercial jetliners . Small world . I run the F. A. A. ' s ... propulsion research facility in Red Valley . What do you make of these new 6250s comin ' out of Northum ? Well , they 'll look a lot better after they sort out their preignition wire bus problems . The S. Q. gyro platforms tend to shimmy at high R. P. M.s ... which could throw off the whole telemetry . Really ? - Mm-hmm . I hadn 't heard anything about it . He 's really something . - Yeah , he sure is . He 's a jerk , and this proves it . I 'm tellin ' you right now , if that thing starts playing ... " Somewhere Over the Rainbow , " I " m gonna blow it into a million pieces . Now , don 't . Wait . It 's a French song from the early ' 40s . " Les Mots D " Amour . " - " The Language of Love . " It was yours , huh , Syd ? When the Allies liberated our camp ... my brother Jacob and I had to make our way back home to Lyon . When we got home , the house my father built by hand ... was reduced to mere rubble . But in the debris , we found this record . It was my mother 's favorite song . She would put it on and make my father dance with her . And my brother Jacob and I would have to watch them . I thought I had lost it years ago . Sydney , what do you think Jarod is trying to tell us with all of this ? I don 't know . But I 'm glad he is . Four children , 12 grandchildren and 10 great-grandkids . I 'd say I 'm blessed , wouldn 't you ? - I 'd say . Is this Zoe with Katie ? Oh , this is one of my favorites . And this was taken just a few weeks before , uh , Katie died . It was almost like they both died on the same day . You know , it hit everybody pretty hard . But Zoe , she was devastated . I can imagine . Her twin sister . In time , the rest of the family managed to go on . But I think she resented them , like they were forgetting about Katie . Zoe just sort of spiraled after that , pullin ' away from the family . That 's when Zoe ran away . - Mmm . I have a feeling now I can worry less . What are you two gossiping about ? - Oh , none of your business . Shh . You sleep tight . - Good night . And I 'll see you in the morning . We did it ! We pulled it off ! Oh , and , Jarod , that whole airline engine thing ? Perfect . Thank you so much . Why is it so important that they think your life is something that it 's not ? You don 't understand . I have always been the family screwup . No direction , no decent job . Lousy relationships . Look at my brothers and sisters . All success stories . Well , who cares what they think ? - I don 't . But my grandmother ... I want her to think that ... I 've turned my life around - that I 'm happy . Even if it is a lie . It 'll be easier for her that way . What do you mean by that ? - Nothing . Hey , I know how we can really convince them that we 're newlyweds . Stick around . What is it ? - How long have you known you were sick ? How 'd you know I was sick ? - These prescriptions ... are all precursors for chemotherapy . How long have you known ? I don 't know . Three weeks . And you haven 't filled the prescriptions yet . Zoe - I haven 't gotten around to it . - This is serious . Your carefree attitude won 't make it go away . What do you want from me , some scene out of Love Story ? Sorry . Drama queen 's not my style . I 'm going to the drugstore tomorrow . - You don 't have to do that . I want to . - I don 't want you to . Jarod , I 've seen people fight this type of cancer before . All the agony and sickness . The cure 's worse than the disease . Besides , most of them die anyway . - There are new treatments - advancements that could give you a real chance . So now you 're a doctor too ? - I 'm just saying it doesn 't have to be a fatal condition . Life is a fatal condition . You get off the bus , suck all the juice out of the years you have ... and it 's ... good night , Cleveland . You 've been a beautiful crowd . Those are the rules . Always have been . I get it . And I 'm not gonna cry and plead for special treatment just as the curtain 's closing . You know , it 's weird , but in some ways , it 's been a good thing . It made me realize I had to get away from Vince . Brought me here to see my grandmother again . Even brought me to you . You can 't give up without a fight . Yes , I can . Jarod , don 't say anything ... about this to anyone , especially my grandmother . Zoe ... - Promise me ? I can 't accept this . - You have to . This is my life . These are my decisions . Besides , maybe I deserve it . Jarod ? I vote we go back to the Munchkin and shoot our way out of this madhouse . This journey isn 't over till we find what Jarod left for you , Miss Parker . And I think we just found it . This looks like the basket that Dorothy carried Toto in . Well , if Jarod rustled up my old dog Mr. Sheckle ... it ain 't gonna be pretty . A thimble ? - Miss Parker ? My family ... didn 't spend a lot of time together when I was growing up . My father was always at the Centre . If he was around , my mother was off in an orphanage somewhere . But one day ... there had been a big storm . But the roads were all closed . Everything was shut down . Daddy , of course , was annoyed . But I was elated , because it was just the three ofus ... trapped together in the house . So , you all just sewed something . We played Monopoly . - Oh . We played Monopoly all day and into the night . Daddy was the shoe , my mother was the car , and I was ... the thimble . So , why do you suppose Jarod is doing this ? I mean , what do you think he 's trying to say ? There 's no place like home . - There 's no place like home . Which is how we get the hell out ofhere . Okay , let me hear it one more time ! There 's no place ... - We 've said it three times already ! I know , but I gotta hear it with the shoes clicking . You 're gonna hear it with the clicking of my 9 millimeter ... if you don 't open the damn door ! Hey , nice attitude ! Don 't forget to come back ... and see me next time you 're in the Emerald City , huh ? I really wish you weren 't leaving ' so soon . - So do I. But Jarod 's speaking at a big conference up north . And if we don 't leave now , well , he 's gonna be late . Well , don 't you keep my little girl away too long , Jarod . I want to see her back here soon . Oh , she 'll be back before you know it . Oh , one more thing , Gram . I have something for you . A surprise birthday present . But my birthday isn 't for two months . - That 's why it 's a surprise . But don 't open it until after we leave . I love you . - I love you , Zoe . Oh , I love you . Bye . Thank you , Jarod , for keeping your promise . I still think you should tell her . Better she remember me like this . Driving away one last time ? No . Happy . And I 'd really appreciate it if you 'd be happy too . You know , enough of this morose crap . I plan on making the most of my time that 's left . And by the way , if you 're out near Freeburg today ... the local " Y " is putting on a carnival . They " re gonna have games , rides . Bring the whole family down . - Come on , Jarod . Show me a good time . - You 'll have lots of fun - It 's not home , but it 'll do . Looks like the next piece of Jarod 's puzzle 's already here . The Wicked Witch of the West . Hey , doesn 't it kind of look a little ... like - I 'll take that as a compliment . There must be more than the obvious interpretation . Maybe some deeper meaning ? Hey , look . Broots , call the airstrip . Tell them to get my broomstick fired up . We 're goin ' back to Kansas . The manager said our room is around here . You 're amazing , Jarod . I 've never seen someone ... win one game after another like that . It 's really very simple . It 's all a matter of geometry and physics . Right . - Okay , I worked a stint as a carny a while back . I know all their secrets . - Now , why doesn 't that surprise me ? He gave us lucky number seven . Where are you going now ? Zoe ? - It 's magical , Jarod . Don 't you feel like takin ' a dip ? Come on . - Zoe , no . Jarod , yes . Look at it . It 's calling us . I don 't have a bathing suit . - Neither do I. I don 't know . - Hey , I paid for the room . The least you can do is swim with me . You 've never skinny-dipped before , have you ? Is that what they call it ? Yeah . Jump in and I 'll show you why . You 're crazy , you know that ? - And you 're stalling . Just what does a naked woman have to do to get you in here ? It 's not so bad , is it ? - Nice . It 's pretty good . Hi . Mmm . Zoe ? Okay , what are you doing ? - Last night was amazing . Mmm . - The last 48 hours have been amazing . Falling in love wasn 't part of the plan . What plan ? - The one that says I have to go now , and it has to be alone . What ? What are you doing ? This isn 't funny . Unlock these cuffs . Unlock the cuffs ! Give me the key ! - I can 't . Look , you 're going to get well . You 'll beat this ! No , I won 't ! I 'm sure of that . I need to end things my way . Go out with a bang , right ? Zoe , don 't do this . - Jarod , you 're good at pretending . Just pretend you never met me . - Zoe ! Zoe - Zoe ! Hi , honey . Goin ' somewhere ? The game 's over . It 's time to go home . - That 's not my home anymore . I told you , you and I are over . - If you didn 't want me to find you ... then you wouldn 't have used your credit card to rent the room . You haven 't blown all that money ? - The money was mine ! It was ours ! - Fine . You know what ? You can have it , but you can 't have me ! - You really wanna take me on ? Do you ? - I will if I have to . What the hell ? You 're with this guy ? - Come on , Zoe . It 's all right . Hey ! - Look , she doesn 't wanna be with you . Why can 't you get that through your head ? - That 's not her decision . And it 's not yours either . Let 's go . Oh , my God , Vince , no ! - You must 've had some fun last night , huh ? I 'll tell you what . Not like the fun you and I are gonna have tonight . Vince , don 't ! You got some brass ones ! I 'll give you that ! Zoe ! Zoe ! Zoe ? How 'd you know ? I called your grandmother . She said this is where your sister died . Please , I want to talk to you . - Oh , no , you don 't . You want to stop me from finishing my journey . Zoe , what happened was terrible , and it was very sad ... but it was an accident . You have to stop blaming yourself for it . I 'm the one who told her to climb up here . I only meant it as a joke , but Katie , she never turned down a dare . She was right about here when she slipped . Katie should have been the one that lived . She was smarter , funnier . So you think you deserve to die . Is that it ? It 's not like I 've been a big success in life . Look at what I 've done to mine . I 've made a mess of it . Because you 've been punishing yourself for what happened to your sister ... and that 's why you 're not fighting the cancer . This isn 't about living life to the fullest ... or going out with a bang . You 're not fighting it because you don 't think you deserve to beat it . God , Jarod . I 'm just so scared . - I know you are . And I 'm going to help you . But there 's only one place to do it ... and that 's with the people you love . Why would Jarod bring us all the way back here ... when nothing has changed ? Well , nothing except this . It 's not exactly ruby slippers . I think Jarod fell asleep in the magical poppies a little too long . A note from Jarod , Sydney ? What does it say ? " There 's no place like home . " - In case we didn 't get it before ? " Everyone deserves one . So why don 't you ... leave me alone and let me find mine ? " Are you sure about this ? Yeah , I 'm sure . - You got a long fight ahead of you . I don 't want you to have to go through it alone . I 'm not alone . I 've got them . And I 've got you . In here . - I want to stay with you . I know . But you can 't stay , can you ? I can see it in your eyes . Thank you ... for helping me find my way back home . Good-bye . You ever say that word again , I 'll kick your butt . Go .

 Slow down , Q-Ball . The Professor 's beat . We need to stop and rest . If he 's beat , how come you 're the one complaining ? I 'm tired of hearing you two bicker . Well , I 'm tired of him marching us around . Guys , come on . We 'll be able to rest and get some water when we reach LA . Assuming it even exists on this world . Oh , that 's nice , Rembrandt . Way to keep our spirits up . You okay ? I 'm fine . Are you in pain ? You said you 'd respect a dying man 's wish . We agreed not to discuss it . Not with them , not with us . [ Wind howling ] Well , looks like we 're not alone on this world . Yes . And the natives do not appear to be hospitable . No water . Nothin ' . Not even a body . Let 's keep moving . [ People chattering ] [ Engine humming ] The Sand Pit . Sounds delightful . I don 't care if it 's a snake pit , as long as it has water . [ Muffled screams ] Take a seat . We 'll settle the price . ( Wade ) Please don 't tell me he 's selling her . Well , let 's not come to any judgment before we know more about this world . Besides , she might be a mass murderer for all we know . Listen , don 't give me that , Professor . It 's wrong , on any world . What is up with them ? [ Moaning ] Promise you won 't scream again ? It 's happening . The amulet 's making that sound . Ow . ( Devin ) Please help me . Please help me . Please . Please help me . ( Quinn ) Wade , what 's wrong ? You okay ? ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . I know it was her . ( Quinn ) Wade , she was gagged . There 's no way you could understand anything she was saying . I heard something . You all right ? You look a little pale . No , I 'm fine . I just could use some water , that 's all . Excuse ... excuse me , wha-what 's the story here ? Are you buying that girl from him ? Oh , no , I don 't deal with the slave trade . Bad karma there . Do you have police around here ? Police ? Oh , that 's rich . [ Laughing ] Ain 't no law around here , baby girl . ( Diggs ) Except maybe for Cutter . Hasn 't been since the water dried up . Uh , anyway , I got other customers . You going to order something ? Uh , yeah , I 'd like to have some water . Tall glass . ( Diggs ) Brown or clear ? Uh , brown or clear ? We 'll take the clear . Nice choice . What are you trading ? [ Diggs clears throats ] I take it you don 't take cash . ( Diggs ) Uh-uh . Ooh , nice . But it runs on batteries . We don 't get too many of those around here . Uh , we trade useful items . Uh , tools , skins , that sort of thing . Come on , help us out . We need some water . What are we supposed to do ? You could always try to find the lost city of Aquarius . They say the water runs free down there . Of course , they also say it 's where the spaceships go to gas up . [ Diggs laughing ] Let me know if you find something to trade . What 's the scoop ? Any luck ? It 's a company town . And Diggs doesn 't like our company . Looks like we 're going to be without water for the duration of our stay . I don 't know whether to strangle him or to admire him . I vote for strangle . ( Wade ) I don 't care if you guys are going to help me . I 'm going to do something for that girl . Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . Whoa . Okay , we 'll do it your way . But I choose when . [ Dogs barking ] [ Panting ] You saved my life . Look , Cutter will pay you for it . He 'll give you all the water you need . Hey , that sounds great . How are you connected with Cutter ? I 'm his water priestess . We 'll talk about that later . ( Jeremy ) Hey ! Get away from her . All right , bro , just stay cool . We don 't want any trouble . Stay cool , man ! Knife , huh ? Better be able to use it . Get him ! Relax , bro . These two are gonna tear you apart ! Why don 't you drop it ? Uh-uh . She 's coming with me . I think it 's simple : The lady doesn 't want to go with you . [ Groaning ] Grab that rope ! You guys don 't know what you 're doing ! [ Moaning ] This isn 't over . You come near me again and I 'll have Cutter kill you piece by piece . Let 's go . Let 's take his car . It 's a personal possession , and it is not what we agreed . We ready to go ? [ Sighs ] There seems to be some problem with the negotiation . I 'm talking a monster truck with fuel . We 're talking supplies , with a car . What more could you want ? I want the girl 's necklace . Now , I get it , or you can all climb in this itty-bitty car like circus clowns . I don 't care . Uh-uh . I can 't . I 've had this my whole life . Look , w-we 'll give you something else . You don 't have nothing else I want . It 's the crystal or no deal . ( Diggs ) Come on . Let 's go . ( Quinn ) Ride ! We ride ! Where are the keys ? Now , hold up now , baby boy . How much more gold you got ? You already took all my gold . Oh , now , come on . Don 't treat me like I took the girl . I 'm a businessman . I got rent to pay here , I got mouths to feed . Give me the keys . Today was a good day . You sure we 're headed in the right direction ? [ Men screaming ] ( Professor ) Where did they come from ? ( Quinn ) Desert rats . Probably the same ones who torched the truck we saw . ( Professor ) Floor it , Mr. Mallory . [ Bikers screaming ] [ Bikers whooping ] Devin , get down ! No , let me up ! ( Wade ) Stay down ! ( Devin ) Get off me ! Let go of me ! [ Bikers screaming ] Stay down ! Get off me ! Let me up ! Let me up ! [ Bikers whooping ] This is insane ! Get off ! Stop , they 're my friends ! I said stop ! They 're my friends . Figures . We rescue the biker babe that rides with Mad Max . These people took you ? Oh , no , no , no . They saved me . I owe them . I 'm not gonna kill you . Consider the debt paid . But I promised them water . Look , we 're only in town two days . We don 't need very much . All right , follow us if you can . You , my child , will ride with me . She promised them water . We 're probably gonna have to lose them . Cutter , she 's working . Come on , girl , find it . That 's it . Yeah . Okay . [ Wind howling ] Yes ! Here . 20 barrels . Maybe more . Tell the others we 're gonna pitch camp here tonight , okay ? Right , right . ( Cutter ) Wet yourself and let yourself dry ! [ Cutter laughing ] Take it ! It 's good ! [ People chattering ] ( Cutter ) Where you going , water witch ? She 's amazing , isn 't she ? Cutter found her wandering in the desert when she was a kid . Talk about a lucky find , huh ? That , uh , that thing she did out there today , does she do that a lot ? When the spirit moves her . She is a witch . [ Davy laughing ] ( Davy ) A water witch . [ Laughing ] We don 't know how she finds it . She does . She just goes into a trance and we dig . She never misses . Never . [ Laughing ] She must wonder where she came from , who her family is . I told you , Cutter found her ! ( Davy ) We 're her family now . Don 't forget that . Talk about your bad seed . That guy 's a freak . They 're all freaks . I say we get our supplies and leave here as soon as we can . First thing in the morning . [ Crickets chirping ] How long have you been able to find water ? As long as I can remember . Cutter calls it my gift . More like my curse . And the clouds and everything , that was you ? [ Laughing ] Wow . Pretty amazing . Welcome to the freak show . You 're not a freak . On my world , there are people called dowsers and they use a ... a forked stick or a wire to find water . Really ? Mmm-hmm . They don 't get the big special effects show like you do , though . Devin , you do have a gift . It sets you apart , makes you different . Cherish it . ( Cutter ) Devin , get over here ! Hang with us tonight . You go ahead . I 'm gonna turn in . [ Groaning ] [ Groaning ] [ Bird cawing ] [ Both groaning ] Let go of me ! You ? Keep away from me , I 'm warning you . Relax , I won 't hurt you . I 'm after Devin . She 's of my tribe . Oh , yeah , right . That 's why she was trying to get away from you . She doesn 't know . Cutter stole her when she was small . She can 't remember her people . She can find water . That makes her valuable . I 'm here to take her home . That 's it . [ Engine starting ] Get in . [ Bird cawing ] Remmy . Professor . She 's gone . What do you mean , she 's gone ? I mean her chain 's been snapped . There 's a cut in the back of her tent . She 's gone ! Jeremy . What 's going on ? Have you seen Wade ? She was gone when I got up this morning . I just figured she went for a walk . We think Jeremy came back for you . [ Sighs ] I 'll go get Cutter . We 'll track them down . ( Quinn ) We appreciate the help . This isn 't just about Wade . I don 't want him coming after me again . Ever . [ Men chanting ] Hunt ! Hunt ! Hunt ! Hunt ! Hunt ! I think it would be a very good idea if we found Wade first . [ Both panting ] You 're the first guy I 've ever met that really did run out of gas . See , on my world , whenever you 're on a date and a guy wants to park , he 'll tell you that ... Forget it . I can 't believe you didn 't check . Was I supposed to fill up before or after you and your friends took off with Devin ? I 'm not used to this heat . What 's with the markings ? They tell the story of my tribe . See , this indicates we 're a splinter from the main group . And this tells where our group settled . I recognize this one . It 's the zodiac symbol for Aquarius . We 're sometimes called " The Water Bearers . " The myth ? L-l-lt 's true about Eden and the lost city of Aquarius ? We 're not lost . We just choose to remain a mystery . [ Bikers hollering ] I don 't understand why Devin doesn 't know she 's one of you . She was only five when she was taken . And what happened out there , it was ... was brutal . She probably doesn 't want to remember . Why wait 12 years to look ? We didn 't know if she was dead or alive . It was only about two months ago her mother was able to make contact . Contact ? I don 't exactly see any phones out here . What ? Have you no powers ? I 'm not gifted , but you should have picked up something . You mean telepathically ? The women of our tribe have powers . Abilities to communicate . Can they all find water ? Not all . Only some . Water priestesses , like Devin . So she is special . Even for your tribe . Yes . Even for my tribe . [ Whooping ] They must be headed back to the Sand Pit . It 's the only thing that makes any sense . Unless ... he might have just left her out there . With no oceans and no lakes , I can 't make heads or tails of this thing . Perhaps you don 't have to . There they are . She looks okay . They look rather chummy , actually , considering she 's been kidnapped . Are you hurt ? No , I 'm fine . Stay away from her ! Hey , hey , hey ! It 's okay . He 's a good guy . Really . Cutter kidnapped Devin when she was five . Jeremy 's here to take her home , and we 're going to help him . What , we all took a vote and I was missing ? Remmy , she needs our help . Come on . [ Car engine starting ] [ Bikers hollering ] Cutter , man , this is a wild goose chase . Let 's bag this and get back to the Pit . Your whining is really getting on my nerves , Wolf . Go ! Get out of here ! I 'm gonna get this little punk . Suit yourself , man . ( Jeremy ) You heard her before , Wade . Talk to her . She 'll hear you . ( Wade ) Devin , he 's up here . Devin , can you hear me ? Jeremy 's up here . Devin , Devin , look up . ( Cutter ) Devin . Look , he 's up there . That 's a boy . Go ahead , run . Give me a moving target now . [ Groaning ] [ Both grunting ] Cutter , kill him ! Get off me , man ! Get off me ! Come on ! Cutter ! ( Quinn ) Go on , move it ! Okay . Hang on . [ Groaning ] Devin ! You don 't look so good . I don 't feel so good , either . Must be the heat . ( Devin ) No , I don 't believe any of this . Look , he found me in the desert and he saved me . I 'd be dead right now if it wasn 't for him . He didn 't save you , Devin . It 's because of Cutter you were in the desert in the first place . Leave me alone . They set a trap . They got her . We got to get her back . Give me your keys . [ In Hebrew ] To Life . [ Panting ] Hey ! Hey , Cutter , man , what 's with the grab ? Devin 's amulet . I want it . Uh-uh . I love this thing . Cool , huh ? I 'll be damned , it was talking to her . Oh , just like the legend , huh ? They 're real . Who 's real ? The Water People . She 's one of them . I had her all along . Give it to me . You know what , Cutter ? You 've been in the sun way too long , man . Ain 't no truth to none of them stories . Diggs , give it to me . I didn 't want it , anyway . [ Wind howling ] It seems to be stronger pointed that way . Maybe it 's some sort of a homing device . That 's what she 's been hearing . Not much of a tune . No , it 's signaling her , you damn fool . They 're signaling her . I 'm gonna find Eden . [ Wind howling ] Does that thing really tell you which way to go ? It 's a locator . Helps bring us home . Here , hold it . [ Wind howling ] Louder it gets , closer you are . We traded Devin 's for the truck . It 's okay . You don 't know how to use it , it 's just a crystal . We 'll keep going this way . We 're not far . Professor , we 're leaving . I 'm fine . Are you sick ? No , no , just a touch of , uh , heat stroke . Let 's go . Shall we ? It 's more than heat stroke , isn 't it ? Yeah . It 's pretty serious . We have a Master Healer in the colony . Maybe he can help . ( Rembrandt ) Wade , let 's go ! ( Wade ) Hold on . She 's trying to reach her mom . She says that she loves me and she misses me . [ Sighs ] She spoke to me . Devin ? I don 't need help , thank you , Mr. Mallory . After all we heard about this colony , I was expecting more . A door or something . I have the idea that 's how they want you to feel . Underwhelmed . If you didn 't know this place was special , you 'd just keep on going . Devin , honey . [ Bikers hollering ] Daddy ! [ Screaming ] What happened to her ? Flashback . She knows the truth now . Cutter killed her father . She just relived that moment . If that 's what the power is , I wouldn 't want it . No gift comes without a string or two attached . That 's more like it . All right , stop right here ! [ Laughs ] There it is . Aquarius . The legends are true . I killed her father right up there . Looks like a pile of rocks to me . Where 's the water ? Underground . God , you 're an idiot . I don 't know how I ever hooked up with you . So how we gonna get the water ? We go in after it . You ask me another stupid question like that , I 'm gonna cut your tongue out . Which way ? Follow me . There it is . ( Devin ) I do remember this . ( Rembrandt ) This is amazing . [ Birds chirping ] ( Rembrandt ) Thank you . This is the best water I 've ever tasted . No wonder they go to such lengths to guard their treasure . ( Devin ) Mom , I 've missed you . ( Fiona ) Me , too , darling . My baby . Master Healer , this is Quinn Mallory . He has a friend who needs your help . ( Quinn ) Professor . I 'm the Master Healer . I can help you , but only if you believe I can . Sir , I 'm a man of science . I respect knowledge and truth . There is a truth beyond knowledge , my friend . Only fools deny it . Are you calling me a fool , sir ? What would you call a dying man who passes up a chance for life purely out of intellectual vanity ? A realist ? Professor , why not give it a shot ? Oh , come , Mr. Mallory . So the Healer is right . It is your vanity . You can 't stand the idea that you might be wrong . You 'll even die to be certain that you 're right ? It 's your life , Professor . Mr. Mallory . I keep forgetting that you are more fearful of my death than I am . If it will make you happier , I 'll go and visit the witch doctor . [ Whispering ] Just as I expected . Hocus pocus and mumbo jumbo . I totally agree . This is all just for show . But people like it . It is rather pleasant , wouldn 't you agree ? Well , it 's certainly not harmful . Attitude is good for what ails you , Professor . I have the gift of healing and it is my duty to share it with you . So lose the negative energy . Take one of these and lie down . What is this , some magic herbal mix that will cure all my aches ? No , they 're mints . We make them ourselves . They 're quite good . Hmm . [ Groans ] [ Groaning ] Did you feel that ? Yes . [ In Latin ] Go , this is the dismissal . I 'm not done yet . But you just told me you were . I did ? " Ite missa est . Go , the ceremony is over . " [ Whispering ] I didn 't know that . I 've been saying it for years . I 've done all that I can for you . You will heal . You have done nothing . ( Master healer ) This is not about me . Open up your mind to the possibilities . Believe in your own powers to heal yourself . What happens next is now in your hands . [ Sighing ] You risked a lot going after her . She 's my promised one . Devin and I were matched as children . I 've loved her ever since . Even when she was missing . ( Jeremy ) That feeling never left me . I think she 's got the feeling for you , too . I also think she 'll be happy in here . For the first time in her life , she belongs somewhere . Sorry , guys , but , uh , time to go . Where 's the Professor ? The Professor is here . Let 's go . Were you ... Don 't even ask . Sure . How you feeling ? [ Sighing ] Better , Mr. Mallory . Much better . No thanks to the witch doctor . [ Sighs ] Well , we still got a couple of minutes left . What 's that noise ? [ Motorcycle engine revving ] Cutter . He must 've followed us . We gotta warn them . Devin , Jeremy ! Open up ! Talk to her ! You can do it ! ( Wade ) Devin , Devin , we 're in trouble . There 's trouble . Come on ! Professor , come on ! ( Devin ) Quickly ! How do we get past this ? I 've got the key . Let 's move it ! All right , let 's go ! [ Men whooping ] ( Devin ) Hurry , before they seal the entrance . There they go ! Run ! Move . ( Cutter ) All I want is the girl ! I found her ! She 's mine ! Haven 't you stolen enough from her life already ? Shut up ! Back off ! On the count of five , blood starts to flow . One ! Two ! Give me the girl , damn it ! Now ! Go ahead , Devin . You know what you can do . Release him . I 'll come with you . ( Cutter ) Come on , baby . Let 's get the hell out of here . No , Devin ! We gotta go . [ Whooshing ] It 's somewhere here ! Here . It 's there . No , farther south . No , further west . East . East ? No . Cutter . Why don 't you just go on home , man ? Home ? Uh ... Yeah . No , it 's ... it 's here . It 's right there . I was there . I was . Uh , wasn 't I ? Yeah , Cutter , you were there . No , I was there . Come on , I 'll take you home , man .

 It 's inevitable , the same dream . I 'm flying amongst the stars , directly toward the sun . Alone . Always alone . I 've become aware of a premonition that the sun is about to explode . And what upsets me most is why . Why did the sun have to die ? I fall through space , shocked to be alive ... but presuming my life will soon be over . I see the house where it happened - where the artificial intelligence rebels , the Silicates ... took my parents 'lives , and I wanna know why . - The lights ! - [ Shane ] I need to know why . Shane , take care of them . Remember how I told you ? - [ Beeping ] - They 're here ! Hurry ! [ Screams ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] # # # # [ Rock Blaring ] Cooper , turn it off ! What the hell is wrong with you , man ? Turn it off ! # # # # [ Continues ] Coop , man , do you know what time it is ? Turn it off ! # # [ Man Singing , Off ] - What the hell is your problem ? - [ Door Whistles , Opens ] Listen up ! You 're shipping ' out . Grab some chow , suit up and report to the ISSCVloading bay in 20 mikes . - [ Groans ] - Time to get up anyway . - Atten-hut ! - As you were . All right . This one , you 're goin ' in on the ground . You 're to travel 215 M.S.K. ' s beyond the seventh sector of the Kuiper Belt . Destination : The mining facility on Bunuel . Ground assault ? - Sentry duty . - [ Soldiers Groaning ] Sir , the Chigs are kickin our ass in a campaign outside Proxima . Why are we being wasted on sentry duty ? The procurement and protection of raw material is vital to any war effort . And the way this war is going , we can 't afford any setbacks . The facility on Bunuel mines natural helium 3 ... a vital component of military rocket fuel . Without it , every ship and jet in this fleet is grounded , and we die . The miners are preparing to transfer ice ore ... to a heavily armed convoy which arrives in two days . You are to guard against any enemy attempt to disrupt that transfer . - All clear ? - [ Soldiers ] Yes , sir . I know you think this is routine , but look alive . In this war , there is no such thing as a routine assignment . Now , I 've been called to the carrier Colin Powell to advise on A.C.M. Strategies . So , Vansen , you 're honcho . West is X.O. Move out . Sir ! Uh - [ Clears Throat ] - Maybe West should be honcho . - What 's the problem ? It 's not like you to turn down command . You ever feel like there 's something out there ... waiting ? Feeling like maybe you 're not coming back ? Everyone gets that . How does everyone deal with it ? They go out and they come back , or they don 't . Thanks for keeping it simple . Vansen . There 's no such thing as predetermination , and there 's no such thing as luck . You make things happen . Keep your head together and don 't make mistakes , and you 'll come back . It 's that simple . You 're honcho . [ Gasps ] - [ Screams ] - [ Beeping ] [ Screams ] [ Paul ] Some buddies took me to Las Vegas right before the academy ... and , uh , we saw this show at the Destiny Casino - " Great Moments of Vegas . " Right . They 're all robomations , but there was this one . I forget the guy 's name . A fat guy - huge collars , scarves and stuff ... white suit , huge sideburns - swingin ' around , doing karate moves , singin ' this song . - He 's going - # # [ Singing ] - [ Laughter ] I was rollin : And the weird thing is ... outrageous as this guy looked , afterwards ... I swear on my life , I saw him in the grocery store . Right afterwards . It was unbelievable . - A huge guy . - InVitros are bad gamblers . There was only a 27 percent success rate of gestation in the Tanks . We used up all our luck just being born . [ Beeping ] [ Alarm Blaring ] Got a bogey tracking us . D.M.E. Says about 100 K.M.S.K. ' s and closing in . - [ Shane ] Did you send out an I.F.F. ? - [ Damphousse ] No response . It 's a single body . Chig attack jets always fly in groups . Could be a comet . Flight Command , this is Vansen . Alter line of travel 25 degrees for E.A. [ Woman On Radio ] Copy that . Evasive Action in three , two , one . - [ Alarm Blaring ] - It altered its course . Stations ! - [ All Shouting ] - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - [ Chattering ] - [ Alarm Continues ] - Cap Comm status . - Bogey , 75 K.M.S.K. ' s , closing . All stations , 14 by 10 degrees off the port stern . Shane , check Channel 4 . [ Beeping ] Silicates . Negative . A.I. ' s have never been seen in this area . - That 's an artificial intelligence signal . - Bogey , 3 : 00 . - West , I can 't get to it . - Got it . - Got it ! - Nice shot , Cooper ! - [ Shouts ] - Direct kill . Bogey has been terminated . - Had to be a comet . - Looked to me like an alien mother ship . You 're probably right . The comet 's refraction ... might have made it look like it was altering course . - Yeah , right . - Still scanning . Powering down over here . - All right . Let 's close it . - It 's at 360 . Clear . Approaching destination . [ Damphousse On Radio ] Icarus Mining Colony , this is the 58th Squadron . Requesting permission to land . [ Man On Radio ] Twelve down , 10 over . Ten down , three over . Five , four , three , two , contact . Good luck , 58th . Catch you later . I 've waited months for this - a surface gravity two-thirds less than Earth 's . Go long . - Go real long . - You 'll never see it . Wang , known for fourth-quarter heroics , steps to the center . He takes the snap , he drops back , he sees Nathan wide open ! It 's a Hail Mary ! He scores ! I can 't wait till this planet gets an expansion team . Five billion years in total darkness . It 's like the sun died or somethin ' . All right . Quit clownin ' around . We 're burnin ' daylight . - What daylight ? - This may be a B.S. Detail ... but until the convoy gets here , we are running it like we are out in the thick . Sterling , Yeoman , you pull watch on the ISSCV . Radio the miners , inform them that the password is " Bulldog , " the response is " Chesty . " - Everyone clear ? Bulldog . - Chesty . The rest of us will man the perimeter . Move out . Woodiat and I 'll cover the west side . - All right . - [ Voices Overlapping ] - [ Man On Radio ] Sentry Seven 's all clear here . - [ Man # 2 ] Sentry Six is clear . [ Radio Continues , Indistinct ] [ Woman On Radio ] Paths on all sides clear . Team One reporting . [ Gasps ] [ Man On Radio ] Processing tanks . All clear . - So , are we having fun yet ? - Mm-hmm . It 's so damn quiet . It sort of freaks me out sometimes ... when all you can hear is your own breathing . Yeah . [ Man On Radio ] Yeah , Pump House 9 , secure . Looks all clear from here . [ Muffled Shout ] [ Radio Continues , Indistinct ] - Bulldog ! - Terrier . - [ Gunfire Continues ] - [ Soldiers Shouting On Radio ] This is Hawkes . Nelson 's down . ! I don 't know what the hell 's happening here ! We got incoming ! Pull back ! Pull back to the ISSCV ! - [ Bullets Zinging ] - [ Shouting Continues ] Open it ! Nelson and Woodiat are dead ! Night-vision binocs . They killed all the miners . Didn 't sound like alien fire . - [ Shane ] It wasn 't aliens . - If it wasn 't the Chigs , then who attacked us ? - And why ? - [ Shane ] They 're not human . And I don 't know why . We have to counterattack now before they have time to establish defenses . - We need reinforcements . We wait for the convoy . - That 's 12 hours . We 're all going to be nothing but little gold stars ... on our mothers ' windows if we just wait here . We 're outnumbered . This will even things up . We have no recon to plan our attack . They 've shut down Platform 1 , but are maintaining mining operations below Platform 2 . They 're hijacking the He , ore . They 've shut off the oxygen and the W.F.R.S. - The what ? - Waste Fluid Recycling System . It converts all of the facilities ' waste fluid ... including sweat and urine , into drinking water . Can you toss me a couple of those ? There 's a subsurface tunnel connecting Platform One to Platform Two ... and both structures to the outside where there 's an air lock , a back door . - Negative . - Just hear me out . Gordon and Wang create a diversion by hitting Platform One with the S.S.M. ' s ... while we enter from below through the tunnel . There will be guards at both points . - We take ' em out with the smart grenades . - That is an unacceptable risk . It 's unacceptable if the Silicates pirate the helium 3 and sell it to the Chigs . And probably a risk Nelson and Woodiat wished they 'd had a chance to take . Risk ? Chance ? You guys are beginning to sound like the damn Silicates . What the hell 's she talkin ' about ? [ Damphousse ] Silicates are creatures of chance . Coop , you 're an InVitro , man . You were raised to fight the A.I. ' s . You know nothing about them ? The InVitro platoons were dissolved when I was born . Why should I care ? A.I. ' s were manufactured to be servants and soldiers-walking P.C. ' s . - Sounds familiar . - InVitros are human . A.I. ' s are machines designed to be visually pleasing ... while programmed to comprehend abstract concepts - philosophy , theology , ethics . They could understand these ideas , but they were not allowed to originate new ideas . Their superior intelligence was totally learned . See , they could understand an idea like freedom ... but they didn 't have the ability to formulate how to obtain freedom . Then how 'd they do it ? Around 2047 , there was a programmer who worked for Silicate-Tronics . He was upgrading the essential A.I. Processing unit - - Dr. Ken Stranahan . - Stranahan was a genius ... but he was sick and tired of his boss taking all the credit , so he inserted a virus . It just said , " Take a chance . " That started the A.I. Wars . See , the idea of risk is like a religion for the A.I. ' s . I mean , the only thing human-created , including themselves ... that they respect is gambling . Silicates learned how to win a rebellion against humans - fear , intimidation , mercilessness . They don 't feel these emotions , but they know how it affects us . For 10 years , they were terrorists on Earth , until we finally got an upper hand . Then again , they took a chance ... commandeered some military launch vehicles and took off into space . Why would " take a chance " cause a rebellion ? Isn 't that what any really new idea is all about ? [ Nathan ] It 's not like you to run from a fight . What 's goin ' on ? The Silicates murdered my mother and father ... and I 'm - Afraid ? They 're destined to kill me . It 's so weird . I 've waited my whole life for this . I never thought that I 'd get a chance to confront them . And now , I - Look , you 're honcho . We all respect you . It 's your call . # # [ Rock Blaring ] # # # # [ Continues ] Let 's make it happen . Do it ! [ Shouts ] [ Gunfire ] - [ Yells ] - [ Shouts ] [ Soldiers Shouting ] [ Yelling ] [ Panting Heavily ] Nuked . [ Nathan ] Sterling 's dead . Vansen and I will try and reinitiate oxygen flow . The rest rendezvous with Wang and Gordon . Move ! [ Beeping ] What do you want , an invitation ? Come on . Get in here . - They 're in here . - [ Beeping ] You took all the hard-way bets and crapped out . Now all bets are off . There 's no way to get it back on . We got about an hour left of residual O2 before we have to use our rebreather packs . I 'm down to 20 percent . West . Thanks for covering my ass back there . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping , Warbled Voice ] [ Warbled Voice Continues ] [ Silicate : Speaker Device ] Damphousse , Vanessa , Lieutenant . - Serial number 5351927 - - [ Cooper ] Damphousse , stop . ! Tell ' em nothin : ! - No ! - Don 't say - - Leave him alone . ! - [ Cooper Screaming ] [ Grunting ] [ Electrical Hum ] Load all of the He , but be ready for the hit-and-run . Right now , we don 't know the convoy 's E.T.A. , but we will . Smart money coughs up the convoy 's arrival time . [ Beeping ] Brandon I.M. Remains functional . He 's prisoner of two Carbonites . - Position ? - Indeterminable due to malfunction . Where are the other two ? Where are the other two ? If the I.M. Unit cashes out , you cash out . - [ Beeping , Warbled Voice ] - This unit 's still functional . That damn sound . That 's how they communicate . They 're networked through a wireless Modem . It 's probably trying to relay its position . - Then they 'll be coming . - Not if we find their position first . If I can call up its Random Access Memory ... the other Silicates may have transmitted their position to this unit . - Crack the casing on your X.T. Unit . - Okay . Hurry ! It 's shutting down . Put the prongs behind the right temporal . [ Female Voice ] They 're attacking the Carbonite colony at Vesta . That 's read-only memory . Try again . Quarter inch higher . [ Male Voice ] Take a chance . Take a chance . Kill ' em all . - Rid the Earth of humans . - That 's the start of the rebellion . Again ! Again ! It 's shutting down ! It 's dying ! - [ Electricity Arcing ] - Silicates have a 5M terabyte collective memory . Any unit can recall events that happened to any A.I. That was ever built . [ Warbled ] Transmission received , 013023 . Feliciti O.H. 519 . Position is currently Platform A , air lock . - This unit is still functional . - We got what we need . If any A.I. Is capable of recalling any A.I. Event ... then this one can tell me why they killed my family . You 've got another family to keep alive . What the hell ? He 's a Tank . What are you doing with them ? They farmed you to kill us , 'cause they didn 't want to die . You 're a sucker . You don 't owe them anything . Give up the other two . What 's the E.T.A. On the convoy ? And you can walk . Come on , Tank . - Don 't like me playing with your nipple ? - It 's a navel . Well , now it 's a target . - Take a chance . - [ Whirring Stops ] That 's what you believe , isn 't it ? I want to take a chance . You got the cards . Let them fall where they may . You win , we 'll tell you what you want . I win , you let us go . I thought you said your luck ran out . - Do you know what you 're doin ' , Cooper ? - Ain 't nothin ' to it . Your bet , my game . Blackjack , single deck . I stick on 17 . - Hole card is down . - What did she say ? - Look , it 's whoever gets closest to 21 without going over . - Got it . [ Warbled Beeping ] The stakes have just been raised . The I.M. Unit has terminated function . Now you 're not playing for your freedom . You 're playing for your lives . You got 17 showing . - Give me one . - No ! Fifteen . Twenty . Fate 's a bitch . [ Cocks Gun ] [ Gunfire ] [ Shouting ] - Cut us down ! - Get the gun ! Get the gun ! Move up ! We 'll get ' em in a cross fire ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - [ Gunfire ] - [ Shouts ] [ Gunfire Continues ] Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Get down ! [ Gunfire Continues ] - I 'm out . - I 've got 12 rounds . Where 's Vansen ? - [ Beeping ] - I hope in a better place than we are . [ Shouting ] [ Beeping ] [ Shane 's Mother 's Voice ] Shane , take care of them . Remember how I told you ? - They 're here ! Hurry ! - Mother . [ Beeping Continues ] The He , is loaded . We 're ready to go . The rest of us will join you after we kill the Carbonites . [ Gunfire ] [ Damphousse ] Down to my last clip . [ Gunfire Continues ] [ Shouts ] [ Shouting ] [ Grunts ] They 're advancing , and I 'm out . I can spare half a clip . [ Alarm Beeping ] The mine 's running out of residual air . If they don 't kill us , CO2 poisoning will . Why am I getting the feeling I 'm not going to catch the next Packers-Bears game ? Can we hold out till the convoy arrives ? It 's hours away . I want to know why . Replay why the Silicates killed my family . Do it , and I 'll let you go . The odds are low against trusting a human . Take a chance . [ Warbled Voice ] [ Man 's Voice ] This is all naval housing . [ Man # 2 ] Slaughter the pigs in the pen . Which one first ? Stop the car . Heads , this house . Tails , that house . [ Beeping ] Tails . Oh , yeah , this is it . I can see pictures ofkids , little girls . It 'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow ... when they find the whole family 's blood on the walls . - [ Beeping Continues ] - The Vansen family . They 've seen us . Better luck next time . [ Shane Shouting ] Shane , they 're here ! [ Screams ] - [ Sighs ] - [ Gunfire Continues ] - [ Gunfire Stops ] - Maybe we just ought to make an all-out break for it . - Every man for himself . - That 's not the way to do it . It 's damn quiet . It 's worse than the gunfire . - They 're gettin ' ready for the last push . - [ Gunfire Resumes ] Wang , what are you doin ' ? Writing them a scorching critical essay ? If any friendlies find my body , I want the ashes spread over Wrigley Field . We 're a long way from Wrigley . [ Beeping ] - [ Beeping Continues ] - Okay , they 're coming . - Don 't fire till they come over the wall ! - [ Gunfire ] - No ! - They 're trying to sucker us to look out . [ Shane ] Bulldog . ! Chesty ! They 're loading the helium 3 . Let 's do it . The facility 's out of air . We 're almost out of ammunition . Take their weapons . If we get to the ISSCV , we can radio the convoy . They 're in position to intercept the A.I. Transport . They 'll retrieve the ore - - That 's not guaranteed ! - They 're pirates ! We gotta save it for the real enemy . They killed my family ... because a coin came up tails . They don 't leave this rock . Shane . You 've got your answer , okay ? Now you know why , and look where you are . Revenge ain 't gonna end it . There 's a thousand of them out there in space . You can 't kill them all . Just drive on , or your fear will come true ... and they 'll kill you without even lifting a weapon . [ Crashing ] Throw it to me ! Throw it to me ! Here ! [ Girl ] Throw it to me , Shane . Throw it to me . ! Throw it to me . ! Give me it . ! I didn 't have a turn . ! [ Laughing ] Why is it always landing on the ground ? [ Female Voice ] Wait . Give it to us . Bring it over here . It 's all right . Come on . Give it to him . [ Whimpering ] [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

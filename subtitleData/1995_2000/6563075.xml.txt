Where were the majority sighted ? On route home , me , others , walk on the minefield by base . Long black car drive up , no door handle , no window . No persons drive . We run . Mines , explosion , but ... no sound . Nothin ' . Silent . You said others . Are any of them with you in America ? Yes . Three of us ... Can you verify ... Difficult . K. G.B. still have much power . Yes . We are each mentioned ... Hello ? Hello . Mrs. De Nunzio , hi . This is Ed Jerse over at Fuller and Siegel . How are you this morning ? - Yeah , Ed , the kids , you know . - I understand . I just wanted to call and let you in on a stock ... that 's going public next week . It 's so hard after the holidays . Don 't hit her with that ! I mean it ! I 'm sorry . What ? A company in Tucson called Cryo-Cord ... has achieved an amazing advancement in the technology of cryogenics . - Uh-hmm . - Stem cells from the blood of an umbilical cord ... may be transplanted in the treatment of many life-threatening diseases such as ... Loser . Such as ? - What ? - Diseases such as ? Before that . What did you say ? I didn 't say nothing . You were talking . The stock they bought is always going to come around . - All right , then I just punch it up here ? - Say it to my face . Right to my face . Now that I 'm in front of you , call me a loser to my face ! - Calm down . - Trash her desk ! Why don 't you go home , Ed ? We 'll discuss this later . I made a last-ditch effort to get out of it , but the Bureau is holding fast to its federal employees vacation policy . I haven 't taken a day off in four years , so either I take a week vacation now , or they start not paying me for eight weeks ' vacation time . I don 't like it , but I got to do it . I got to pay the rent . I got to eat . Part of me can 't help thinking this is just another way to get me out of here . But it is only a week , and you 'll be here to keep an eye on things for me , so ... Here 's a few things for you to keep an eye on while I 'm gone . Why don 't I have a desk ? What do you mean ? - I always assumed that that was your area . - Back there . We 'll have them send down another desk , and there won 't be any room to move around here , but we can put them close together , face-to-face . Maybe we can play some Battleship . What is it you want me to keep an eye on ? That contact we met last night at the wall , who had the distinction of being present for a first . That being you abandoning me during questioning . In the future , I 'll make sure that all those people being interviewed ... provide you with a multimedia laser show to keep your interest maintained . In any case , his name is Vsevlod Pudovkin . He 's a Russian immigrant with a doctorate in astronautical engineering . He and other contacts worked at a military space center in the Republic of Karelia . They smuggled out reverse engineered reports of two alien craft ... which crashed and were retrieved from the Sea of Barents . And these reports are for sale ? At a high price , yeah . Mm-hmm . Have you confirmed the identity of these individuals ? That 's your assignment while I 'm gone . I want you to run an I.N.S. check and a Bureau N.C.I.C. check on these individuals , all of whom now reside in the Little Russia section of Philadelphia . I 've also made arrangements for travel so you can administer eye-to-eye surveillance ... on their activities . - I 'm not going . - What do you mean ? Your contact , while interesting in the context of science fiction , was , at least in my memory , recounting poorly veiled synopsis ... of an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle . " Eenie , meenie , chili beanie , the spirits are about to speak " ? Rocky and Bullwinkle are looking for an Upsidasium mine . Boris Badenov alters the road signs , which causes them to walk onto a secret military base , where they are picked up by a car with no windows and no door locks , and there are silent explosions from a compound called Hushaboom . So you 're refusing an assignment based on the adventures of moose and squirrel ? Refusing an assignment ? That makes it sound like you 're my superior . Do what you want . Don 't go to Philadelphia . But let me remind you I worked my ass off to get these files reopened . You were just assigned . This work is my life . And it 's become mine . - You don 't want it to be ? - This isn 't about you . Oh , maybe it is indirectly . I don 't know . I feel like I 've lost sight of myself , Mulder . It 's hard to see , let alone find in the darkness of covert locations . I wish I could say that we 're going in circles , but we 're not . We 're going in an endless line . Two steps forwards and three steps back , while my own life is ... standing still . Maybe it 's good that we get away from each other for a while . - Where will you be ? - Ironically enough , it 's personal . It 's a ... place I always wanted to go , what I anticipate to be a spiritual journey . I hope to discover something about myself . Maybe you should do the same . Yes , Mrs. Shimatsuno . Ma 'am , what if I swore to you it would never happen again ? I just would like another chance . I need another chance , Mrs. Shimatsuno . Well , that stock I recommended ... Virtual Gambling ... is up . Mm-hmm ! Mm-hmm . Right . I understand . Thank you for your time . Good-bye . " Thank you for your time . " If you were any kind of man , you would have told her to kiss your ass . But no . Another woman sticks it to ya . Ain 't that right , Eddie ? Hey ! I can hear you down there ! Stop it !

Give me a call on my cell when you get a chance . Just let me know where you 're at . Just watch yourself , all right ? That 's not my problem . You don 't understand . You did good work . Very nice . It 's just like in the window . - But ... - So what ? Why do you want to cover it ? Listen , friend , everyone gets tattoo they deserve . What if you don 't cover the whole thing ? - Just the eyes and the mouth . - Even if I say yes , it 's too soon . Skin must heal . - I 'll pay you anything . - Miss ? Miss ? You . You like this on his arm ? Wow . Uh ... Eddie ? The , uh ... The color ... The red on the lips ... It 's extraordinary . Something I find in Soviet prison . I tell him everyone gets tattoo they deserve . Beautiful , cheap , thought over ... I thought I was your girl . Tattoo reflect on body what lies in person 's soul . - You 'd break my heart over a cheap redhead ? - Get them in prison ? Yes , used the sewing needle , paper clip . You talk to her , and I 'm gonna be bad ! Ink is burned shoe leather , charcoal shavings , urine . I find grasses grow in prison yard , rye and such . Only use now , on that tattoo . Svo . Pardon me . - You look . - Mm-hmm . Thank you . Mind some advice from a stranger ? Make sure you 've thought it over before you get it done . You didn 't get the tattoo you deserve ? Mine was , uh , too impulsive . Never say never ? Yeah . - Sometimes I wish I were that impulsive . - Careful what you wish for . There 's more fashionable places in the city . How did you end up here ? I 'm in town visiting my aunt in the neighborhood . How about you ? There 's a real crummy bar across the street . It 's good for when you 're feelin ' down , and I was kind of down last week , and , uh ... So it wasn 't so much impulsive as it was hammered ? Have you , um , seen much of Philadelphia ? No . There 's a couple of really nice restaurants by the river , if you 're interested . I 'd like that . But , um , I , uh , I 'm leaving tonight . Ah . Uh , if you 're ever in town again ... That 's my home number . I work there mainly . - Hello ? - Scully ? - Mulder , what 's wrong ? - Nothing 's wrong . I 'm at that special place , and I wanted to share it with you . You know that Elvis bought all the furniture in just 30 minutes ? - How did you know where I was ? - I checked where we always stay in Philadelphia . I knew you wouldn 't abandon me . How 's the case going ? I 've handed it over to the Philadelphia Bureau . The Philadelphia Bureau ? They don 't know or care about the X files . What are you doing ? Mulder , there is no X file . Your contact is connected to the Vorovskoi Mir . Extortion , credit fraud , cons . He is nothing but a swindler . - How do you know ? - What do you mean , how do I know ? You assigned me the background check . I did as told , as always . Hold off until I get there , okay ? - You don 't think I 'm capable ? - Of course I believe you 're capable . It 's just that in this case I need you to ... It 's not just in this case , Mulder . What 's the agent 's name in Philadelphia ? It is over . Done . Pudovkin is out of our hands . Look , Mulder , I have to go . What , you got a date or something ? Y-You 're kidding ? I have everything under control . I will talk to you later . Isn 't it better this way , baby ? Me and you alone ? Women are so petty , jealous , controlling . That bitch today would have been just like all the others . - Hello ? - Um , hi . Ed Jerse , please . - This is him . - It 's Dana . We met today . My flight was canceled because of this storm , and I was just wondering if I could take you up on dinner . I think it 's worth fighting a little snow . One thing , my ... my car is in the shop . - We 'll have to meet . - I could pick you up . - Give me an hour ? - Good . Well , I 'll see you then . Go ahead . Treat yourself . This girl is a real doll . But beauty 's only skin deep , baby . I go all the way to the bone . Miss Schilling ? - Huh . - She said she 'd be here . - I don 't understand . - Miss Schilling ? - Hi . - Hi . I 'm , uh , early . The storm 's not so bad . It 's supposed to get bad later tonight . Come on in . I 'll be ready in a second . At least we can forego the " What a nice place you have " formalities . Ed , I , uh ... I don 't go out very much . I think the last time I went on a date was to see Glengarry Glen Ross , and the characters in the movie had a much better time . Ed , you 're bleeding . Oh , uh , it 's just the damn tattoo . Here . I 'm a doctor . Do you want me to take a look at it ? No , it 's okay . It 's been nothin ' but trouble . I hope you like this place . I made reservations . Ed ... The , uh ... The crummy bar you told me about ... Take me there . Hey ! So what makes this place a good place to go when you 're feeling down ? It 's kind of ... Everyone here looks like their problems are worse than mine . Makes me feel good about myself . Yeah , but you can 't tell what 's going on in somebody 's head just by looking at them . They 're probably thinking we 're the ones that are screwed up . Are we ? Who knows ? I mean , sometimes I , uh ... I 've always gone around in this , uh ... this circle . It usually starts when an authoritative ... or controlling figure comes into my life . And part of me likes it , needs it , wants the approval . But then at a certain point , along the way , I just , you know ... Okay , um ... My father was a navy captain . I worshipped ... I worship the sea that he sailed on . And when I was 13 or so , I went through this thing , where I would sneak out of my parents ' house ... and smoke my mother 's cigarettes . And I did it because I knew that if he found out , he would kill me . And then along the way , there are other fathers . Sounds a little like your time has come around again . I want things more like a straight line , and I don 't ever want to go backward . That 's why I got the tattoo I deserve . It marked a moment , a feeling , a memorial of something I never want to have happen again . I want to see it . You know , Dana , just ' cause I marked the moment , wanting to go forward , doesn 't mean that it worked . - I want to see it . - Come on . It 's all scabbed up . That 's okay . If you 're so curious , get your own . She wants the same red , like mine . It 's really bad out . Look , the weather and a few drinks under your belt , I 'd feel better if you stayed here . Hey . I 'm not up to anything . I just want you to be safe . I 'll take the couch . The tattoo hurt at all ? Yeah , um , it feels weird . I , uh , I can 't see it . I ... But I feel different . It 's like , uh ... I don 't know how I feel about that . Yeah . It looks all right . Ed , you 're bleeding again . Will you let me take a look at it ? I am a doctor . He said this could happen . Ed , it looks burned . Get her hands off of me ! Those are bad thoughts you 're having , baby . You kiss her , and she 's dead . Adams Inn . - Dana Scully , please . - Thank you . I 'll ring . I 'm sorry , sir . There 's no answer in that room . Thank you . Good morning . I 'm Detective Gouveia . This is Detective Smith . May we speak with Edward Jerse ? Uh , I 'm sorry . He 's not in . I don 't know where he is . - Were you here the night before last ? - No . Can I help you with something ? I 'm with the Bureau . The resident downstairs , Kaye Schilling , was reported missing . Some blood was found in her apartment , not hers . It had some abnormalities . Such as ? Look , I have a background in forensic medicine . I assure you anything you divulge will be held under the strictest confidence . A preliminary toxicology report found this substance in the blood stains . The blood type was A , and hers was O. May I ? Here 's our card . We 'd appreciate Mr. Jerse giving us a call when he returns . And if he doesn 't , we will . Okay . Federal Bureau of Investigation . - Yeah , Fox Mulder , please . One moment . Oh . Good morning . What 's wrong ? Ed , sit down . Some detectives were here . The woman in the apartment downstairs was reported missing . They found blood , and I believe , circumstantially , it may be yours . I was helping her move in , and I cut myself . You need to tell that to the detectives . But what I 'm also afraid of , and this concerns both of us , is that an ergot alkaloid was found in the blood , which is why I think it may have been yours . Ergot is a parasite that lives off of rye and related grasses . Svo said that he used rye somehow in his ink . If this is true , we may be subject to hallucinogenic ergotism . Aural , visual hallucinations , dangerous and unlikely behavior . We need to go to the hospital to be tested . I don 't need that , Dana . It 's such a relief to be able to tell someone . I hear it , Dana , in my head , only deeper . It 's more than just some chemical reaction . She talks to me . She hates women . My wife , my boss , you . She 's so jealous , Dana . She makes me do things I don 't want to . But she controls me . But I believe that you made her go away . We need to get help . I 'm gonna go into the other room , and I 'm gonna come back , and we are gonna go together . Mmm-mmm ? Who 'd she call ? Who 'd she call , Eddie ? Come on ! Aren 't you just dying to know ? Federal Bureau of Investigation . Dana Scully , please . - Dana Scully , please . One moment . All right , let 's go . Never again ! Another woman in my bed ? Burn the sheets , lover . Burn her . Burn her ! Come on , baby . Come on , baby ! Do it for me . Ow ! - This isn 't you , Ed ! - Go on , Eddie ! - Get control of yourself . - Ah , but it 's good to lose control . - Take control ! - Do it for me , Eddie ! Do it ! No ! Welcome back . You look a lot better than you did in the hospital . And congratulations for making a personal appearance in the X files for the second time . It 's a world record . Ed Jerse is in custody at the St. John 's Burn Center in Philadelphia . Traces of ergot were found in his blood stream , as in yours , but not to the degree that should cause hallucinogen icergotism . He 'll undergo psychiatric evaluation after recovering from burn trauma . Comrade Svo has been shut down ... and is under investigation for having connections to my friend Pudovkin . Case closed on Boris Badenov , which is really a shame , because I was thinking of having an N.Y. tattooed on my ass ... to commemorate the Yankees World Series victory . Better late than never , huh ? The , uh ... field office in Dallas is , uh , receiving reports of an image of a missing child ... appearing on a blank billboard outside of Arlington . So ... All this because I ... because I didn 't get you a desk ? Not everything is about you , Mulder . This is my life . Yes , but it 's ...

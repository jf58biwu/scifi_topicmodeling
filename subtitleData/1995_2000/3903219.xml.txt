 I gotta hand it to you , farm boy , that notion was pure genius . Don 't get used to it . We 're not lugging a mattress around . What about an air mattress ? We could fold it up . No . Travel light . That 's the Mallory creed . Exactly . Easier to run if we have to . Which seems to be most of the time . Hey , Quinnster . Thought you were back at Sagan in the quantum lab . Just , you know , stretching the legs out . Who are your friends ? Well , I haven 't seen you around the atom smasher . And you probably won 't . I 'll catch you back at the lab . Quinnster ? Sounds like on this world I 'm the Gen X version of Dean Martin . We could have access to equipment . Give us an edge to get back home . How much time do we have ? Eight days , two hours and 22 seconds . Not to be too specific . Why don 't we find a directory and get to the quantum lab ? While we scope out what other treats this world has to offer . I can never get used to our doubles . It 's like looking in a mirror . A fun house mirror . And yet , I guess they 're family in a way . Brothers once removed . Shall we wait till he leaves ? Nah , the equipment 's rudimentary , outdated . There 's nothing we can use , not that he can either . Not with that flaw in his equation . You see that ? Oh , no ! No , no , no , no . What ? He 's trying to punch a photon rift . You can 't run that much power through an argon laser . Cut the power ! Turn it down ! Come on . Turn it off , for God 's ... Hey , hey , hey . Go get some wet towels . Someone 's been hurt . Call the paramedics . Here , here , here , here , here , here . He burned his eyes . The ambulance is on the way . Get his med card . MHO Gold . Good thing . Looks like he 's gonna need some new parts . Let 's get out of here before someone notices the resemblance . Hey , how 'd that get out of the repository ? Why 'd you do that ? MHO took all the trouble to grow him . Do you think we 're gonna let him just waltz out of here with that boy 's eyes ? What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? What were you doing with that clone , anyway ? Clone ? What are you talking about ? Moberly , you better call the cops . Hey ! " When Good Things Happen to Bad People . " You know , if the Nixon on your world was anything like ours , I don 't know why you 'd wanna read that . To see if there are 18 missing pages . Maggie , Remmy , it 's Quinn . What happened ? There was an explosion at the lab . His eyes were burned . Who , Quinn 's ? No . The double ? Yes . Is he still there ? I don 't know . They called him a clone . They said they needed his eyes . Did they take him ? Where did they take him ? The hospital . They called it the MHO . You mean the HMO ? No , the MHO . All right , I want you to take things slow and careful . Those car trunks can be lethal . Excuse me . Oh . Which one is real ? Mallory . Alpha . And this is his donor shell . Yes , of course . Let me help you with this one . Dr. Mallory . Good . Has ophthalmology been notified ? Yes . Status . Come on ! He 's got severe burns to his face and eyes . We 've administered morphine . All right . Give my son a full blood work-up . I want him stabilized and prepped for surgery as soon as possible . You got it . Pre-op . As for this thing , nurse , lock it down . It has a roving nature . Yes , sir . So this is our bad boy , huh ? Yeah . My head 's a jackhammer . I must go through a gross of these a week . Why can 't you medical science whizzes come up with a cure for that , huh ? Pappas , you are supposed to be running a secure facility here . How could this thing just run off ? It didn 't . What are you talking about ? It looks like a palace . Offhand , I 'd say that the medical establishment isn 't in danger of going broke anytime soon . How 'll we find Quinn in there ? Same as always . Brains , charm and brute force . Maggie , girl , there 's not a day that goes by you don 't bring a smile to my heart . So if Quinn 's still out from that stun gun , we 're gonna need a fast ride . So what do you want , fabric or leather ? Surprise me . I thought the rumors of subversives growing rogues to kill their templates were tabloid fantasies . Think again . How many embryos did you originally culture ? Five . When one proved viable , the others were destroyed . Clearly someone must 've spirited one away . It 's rejoined the living . What 's going on and why am I tied down ? Surprising vocabulary . Correct syntax . Why do you think you are ? How the hell should I know ? I was just trying to help someone . Someone ? At the Sagan lab . This guy who had an incredible resemblance to me . Really . I was trying to speak to him , and his laser blew up . I called the paramedics . You did ? What do you know about lasers ? Well , how about you let me up ? I promise you I 'm not a danger to myself or anyone else . Soon . Lasers ? Just what I learned at school . You went to school ? This was after you left the repository ? How and when did you have your implant removed ? The guy that was injured , how is he ? Burned and blind . Sorry to hear that . Amazing . It can even mimic empathy . Whoever trained it did an incredible job . You know him ? No . You 're a very bad liar , my friend . Is that like saying one is a good Nazi ? A clone with an attitude . Clone ? No , my name is Rudy Zacora . I 'm an exchange student from Canada . Fingerprints . Full blood work . Identical . Oh , your cholesterol 's higher . Guess you eat out a lot . So cut the crap . You were shot and brought here because they took you for the Mallory clone . I mean , the official one . But it was in its bed at the repository . You should have stayed in bed , too . So , isn 't there something you 'd like to share ? No . From a security standpoint , I recommend immediate termination . No . Whatever you think I am , I saved your son 's life . Or maybe you caused the accident . I swear I didn 't . I 'm telling you , I swear . Your ball and your call , Doctor . Termination would be a waste of good tissue . Something could go wrong in the transplant . We can always use a spare . And maybe in the meantime , we find out what the hell you are . RN to Cloning Room 3 . RN to Cloning Room 3 . Thank you . Hi , we 're looking for Quinn Mallory , please . I 'm his brother . Ninth floor . Intensive care . But it says no visitors . Surgery is scheduled in 12 hours . I see . Your father is prepping the surgical team . Would you like me to page him ? My father ? No , we don 't want to disturb him . But I understand that there 's a donor for the transplant . Has he arrived yet ? Yes , it 's in Pre-op Room 3 . Thank you . So that was brains . Now comes the charm ? Not exactly . Hi . Get in . Thanks for your help . I was too busy being impressed . Quinn ? Quinn ? Hospital security , pick up 2217 ... Where the hell is he ? Someone call for a ride ? I don 't think anyone saw us . Good thing there 's a service elevator out back . Did you have any trouble checking us in ? No . Just don 't expect any mints on the pillows , though . This Chandler isn 't exactly The Ritz . Hey , he 's coming around . Hey , buddy , welcome back . Light . Light . New ! Light ! Dark , bright , dark , bright , dark , bright . Dark , bright , dark , bright ... Q - Ball , come on , buddy . Come back to us . These should fit him . He was only there for a few hours . What the devil did they do to him ? They didn 't do anything . What are you talking about ? Look . They branded him . That 's not a brand , that 's an implant . And it 's long since healed . " Mallory C. " As in " clone " ? We took the wrong one . We 've gotta go back . No . After we decked a guard and stole an ambulance ? Maybe it 's just me , but I 'd certainly beef up security after that . I don 't need to hear how we can 't do it . We 've got to . I know , but we 're not gonna help anyone by running around half-cocked . Dark . Hey , there . Hey , there . Hello . Hello . I 'm Maggie , this is Colin , and that 's Rembrandt . What 's your name ? Quinn ? Dark , bright , dark , bright . His implant says Mallory . Mallory ? Mallory . They didn 't even give him a first name . There was someone in the hospital that looked like you . He was my brother . Brother . Okay , we 're counting down to the bonus round here . It 's time to divide and conquer . Rem , they didn 't see you at the hospital , so you go see if we can get back in . I 'm gonna snoop around the hotel , see if I can find out anything . And you , Colin , you just do the best you can . Are you looking for someone , hon ? Or are you just taking in the sights ? Unstrap him . Thank you . Man , do I have an itch . All right , so you can walk . Well , a horse can walk and a parrot can talk . You still don 't believe I 'm human , do you ? How can I ? Then why are you letting me up ? Hit him . What is this ? Cut that out ! You know perfectly well what this is . My son 's donor has been stolen . Don 't look innocent ! I 'm sure you know everything . The acts of sabotage on prior operations , the donor shells taken , anything to hinder us . And now this ! It was purebred . Utterly controlled . And you could be anything . It 's a bottom feeder . But still , we work with what we have . You know , my son is brilliant . Not merely coached to seem clever . Your eyes shall look on wonders . Do you know what your son was working on ? Theoretical physics . He was looking for a doorway between dimensions . I know because I did the same thing . Only I succeeded . I 'm your son 's duplicate , from another world . Pre-op . No . No ! Your son is on the wrong track ! He 's working strictly from a superstring model . He needs to integrate an M-theory base ! Ask him ! M-theory base ! You don 't have to tiptoe , Lauren . How did you know it was me ? I didn 't . But I was hoping . Oh , Quinn . I 'm not gonna say it 's okay , Lauren . We both knew what I was doing was dangerous . But important . Quinn , listen to me . There 's something I need to tell you . Something you don 't know about . What ? When they brought you in , they also brought in your donor shell . That 's impossible . I 've never been cloned . I 've seen it . They 're readying it right now to give you new eyes . No , no . No way that 's gonna happen . Call the others . You know what you have to do . But , Quinn ... Please , Lauren . I 'm begging you to do this for me . Promise me . I promise . All right . You better go . Now go on . Go . What 's his condition , nurse ? He 's strong . But stable . Hey . You look like you 're getting some of your color back . You had me cloned and you didn 't tell me ? I also had you immunized against smallpox and I never mentioned it . Don 't patronize me . Then don 't condescend . It 's easy to have a lot of high moral ideas when you 're young and you haven 't been tested . I 've shielded you from everything . You 've never even had a broken bone . Besides , since your mother died , you 've been my whole world . Your world is too small . You have greatness in you . Think what you 'll be able to accomplish when you 're whole again . This accident took my eyes , not my mind . Look , I 'm just trying to save you . You don 't even know me . Do you really think I 'd ever take the eyes of another person ? It 's not a person . Do you know what I 've been working on ? The specifics ? I 've been trying to open a doorway to another world , so that there would be a place where your clones could go , where they 'd be safe , where you couldn 't reach them . You are not going to maim another person for me . Have you ever heard of M-theory ? Cutting edge of physics . I was just getting into it . Why ? No reason . Dad ... This is Dr. Mallory . Inform the duty nurse my son is to remain sedated pending surgery . Yeah ? You got it . We got a pick up . That 's right . You 're catching on . Alex ! Alex ! Hurting . He 's hurting . TV 's not real . Understand ? Most folks take a while to get that . It 's hard getting your bearings . I know the feeling . Everything 's new . First time watching TV . First time in a hotel room . It 's usually a bit nicer . It 's pretty . Not like home . What 's your home like ? Nothing . Nowhere . Nothing . Nowhere . Nothing . Nowhere . Nothing . Nowhere . Nothing . Nowhere ... It 's all right . You don 't have to go back . Us Mallorys stick together . That 's Quinn . He 's like me . Me . I look like you , too . Are we brothers , Colin ? Yes . Yes , we are . And that 's my father . The one who raised me . Your father probably looks a lot like him , too . It 's complicated but I 'll try to explain . I 'm here to prep the donor . Thank you . Hi . My name is Lauren . Don 't be afraid . I want you to put these on , okay ? I 'm going to take you somewhere safe . Where ? You won 't understand . I might just surprise you . You just might . Supply never restocks these . I 'll be right back . Where is my patient ? Find him ! Quinn had to pull a few strings to get me this job . Nobody knew about us . So I 've been doing things to screw the process up , you know . Slow things down . So you guys run an underground railroad for clones ? Yeah . Only we don 't use trains . Hold it right there , nurse . I believe that 's our property . Turn off the ignition , please . Let 's go this way . Slow and easy . Uh-uh . Everybody , just take it light . 'Cause I don 't think medical science can replace a blasted head just yet . Now hold on . Now let 's talk about this . I 'll have my people call your people . Put them down . Everyone looks so beat up , sick . They should be in a hospital . Hospital ? Why don 't you try a palace while you 're at it . They got no med cards . The rich get richer . The poor get used up . They all look like they were in one giant car wreck . No . No , they were just harvested . Harvested ? Where have you been , hon ? The dark side of the moon ? Some lady I 've never even met steps left . She should 've stepped right . All of a sudden , she 's short a part . But she 's got the money , I 've got the hand . A month of food for my family . Sometimes you got to choose between all of you dying or just a part . And that 's one hard day . So the rich take what they need from the poor . Used to , used to . Now they have clones . So they don 't have to deal with the likes of us . Clones . Sylvia , I need your advice on a story I 'm writing . There 's this lab , and a young man has an accident . Army of the dead . Or leastways those not given a life . I thank you from the bottom of my eyes . Not to sweat it . R.J. Quinn . Didn 't figure you 'd be taking a walk on the wild side , did you ? You 're insane . Well , I guess in an insane world that makes me just about normal . Go check the perimeter alarms . We 'll be clearing out soon . We 're gonna be heading north . He 's gonna be our safe passage . There 'll be a family in Canada to take you in . I appreciate all your help . But I can 't go with you guys . I 'm sorry , I 've got to get back to my friends . Well , the only friends you 've got are right here . We can 't let you go , Quinn . It 'd be too much of a security risk . Trust me . It won 't be a risk . Where I 'm going , no one 's gonna follow me . Sorry , champ . Can I at least call them ? No phone calls in or out . We 're in the cone of silence . I didn 't bust out of one prison to land in another ! The whole world 's a prison . Or haven 't you heard ? America 's a no-clone zone . Yes , but I 'm not a clone . Right . You 're just some stranger 's perfect match . You 're expecting logic and rationality . He 's not capable of that . His mind is chaotic . Like all of them . You see , that 's why he needs to have a controlled environment . What you think is compassion is really only cruelty . Please , just take us back before anybody gets hurt . Had it better when you made clones without heads . Less trouble . But you couldn 't keep us alive that way . You 're ... Ah ! Make as many as you like . Spit them out down the chute . Do they hurt ? Do they feel ? What do you care ? Railroad sprung me when I was three . But not before the men with knives took what they needed . Let me show you some compassion ! R.J. , no ! R.J. , don 't ! We show them we 're human by being human . Storage . That was a hell of a story . Well , it 's all make-believe . What do you think ? I think you should lay off the cheap malt liquor . Sylvia . Okay , you 're right . They would harvest your friend 's eyes no matter where he 's from , if he 's a match . Unless ... Yes ? The clone that they 've grown has been totally supervised , totally monitored , they 'd rather use him . If they thought they could get him back , they 'd hold off . I see . Hypothetically speaking . Of course . Hey , Maggie ... It 's okay . Look , the hospital looks like a cops convention . We 're not getting in anytime soon . I gotta go . How much do I ... Don 't insult me . My father wants to take Quinn 's eyes ? He loves his son , I guess . But it seems a terrible thing . And you want to try and stop him ? Yes . I 'll go with you . No . If we go , you stay here . But they 're my eyes . Which is why you stay here . You don 't hurt someone else to help yourself . At least , that 's how it should be . Aren 't you afraid that they will hurt you ? Yes . But I love my brother . I 'd give my life to save his if I have to . That 's what family does . Hey . We have to talk . Excuse us . All right , I 've got an idea . We call the hospital and we offer to trade him for Quinn . We can 't do that . Of course not . We 'd just say we were to get them to bring Quinn . The guys in the lab coats have a major jones going on to get the clone back . Don 't call him that . His name is Mallory . All right . The point is , they want him . It might be our only chance to get Quinn back . So what 's your move ? All right . We call them up , we lay out our terms . We might need the ... Mallory to get on the phone to prove we have him . All right . I 'll talk to him . Mallory ? Mallory ! He 's gone ! You think he heard us ? He must have thought we were gonna turn him in and ran off . No , before you came , we were talking about how you risk yourself for your family . He 's trying to protect us . He 's gone to the hospital . All right , come on . I 'm gonna go and check it out . I haven 't been seen . All right . But in and out , nothing fancy , okay ? If things get complicated , you pull the plug . You hear me ? Yeah . Let them get deeper into the belly of the beast . And then we take them two at a time . Hey , Mallory ! Look , I appreciate your gesture . Look , we 've got to get out of here , all right ? Hold it right there ! Don 't move ! Hey , thief ! Let 's see your hands ! Back it up ! Face down ! I 've been taking these since I was a kid . They don 't do a damn bit of good . But they 're orange and you can chew them , and hold on to the hope that eventually they 'll kick in . I was hoping you 'd come back , too . I guess sometimes optimism pays off . You saved my life . Yeah , well , don 't hold it against me . So who are you really ? Oh , so now it 's , " Who are you ? " Not , " What ? " We 're making progress . Who do you think I am ? You don 't think I 'm a clone anymore ? You said all that stuff about chaotic thinking and needing a controlled environment to get out of here , right ? Yes . I 'm sorry . You mentioned the M-theory to your son ? Yes . And you were still going to take my eyes . You know who I am ? I 'm someone who 's a lot more human than you . You know , my ... My whole world has been shattered into pieces . I ... I really don 't know what to think . It doesn 't matter what you think . All that matters is what you do . Hey . Something I want you to see . Police and hospital security forces were able to stop an attempted clone theft at the downtown maximized health facility today . Three members of the underground anti-clone faction were taken into custody , and the stolen donor shell was safely recovered . Those are my friends . There seems to be a connection between this incident and the earlier abduction of Dr. Michael Mallory . MHO security spokesman ... They weren 't too careful now , were they ? We are sending this message to those holding Dr. Mallory . We pray he is unharmed , as we , in good faith , have treated their comrades in our custody . We wish to open a dialogue with the sincere hope of quickly and safely resolving this situation . We will ... We 've got to call them . Set up some kind of trade . Excuse me . This was not part of my plan . He 's right . That was the clone that I told you about . The one that got taken . Whoever his friends are , they 're obviously on the same cause that we are . And so we just hand him over to keep right on tending to business ? There are over 300 board certified physicians trained in these procedures . They 'll continue whether I do them or not . Yeah ? Well , I 'll feel much better not . The one that they 've got that looks like me , they grew him and they 're gonna cut him . Just like they did to you . Okay . All right , we 'll make the call . And we 'll save four righteous souls , and pray there 's a hell . Thank you . Thank you very much . No , you thank me when it 's over . I better get things ready . Take him back to the room . Everybody else come on . Wait . There was one of your friends on the TV who looked like you . My brother . Where I come from my father had two sons . Two sons . And he loved you both equally ? I don 't know . I don 't remember . Cute mannequins . I don 't know how cute they are but they 're good listeners . Sometimes silence is the best counsel . Yeah . Gives you room to find your own answers . Although it does get a little lonely . Lonely 's been my style of life , my man . Every morning of my life , I wake up mad . It 's like the inside of me is bigger than the outside . Like there 's a storm swirling about . You told me to be more human . That 's not the problem . The human part of me is what wanted to kill him . I had a friend once . Lonny . Looked just like me , but he smiled a lot more . Laughed at all of my dumb jokes . Me and him were little , we didn 't know much . But we were made from the same cell . We were each other 's whole wide world . Rich kid we were grown from didn 't need a face first . He needed a heart and a liver . And they took Lonny 's . And so I know what lonely is . I 'm sorry . Yeah . If I 'd have known we were coming to the water , I would 've brought my bikini . He wanted it in the middle of nowhere to level the playing field . You got that right . Nice and smooth . No sudden moves . Send us ours , we 'll send you yours . Hey , bro . I thought you traded me in for a newer model . Not a chance . Dad ? Come on , man . Keep moving . Move it ! Colin says that you give up things for your family . If my brother needs my eyes , he can have them . Take the others . This one 's staying . So you could rip out his eyes ? His liver , his heart ? Then I think we 'll just take yours . He 's got a gun ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it or you 're gonna have to shoot me , too ! Don 't shoot . Anything else ? Yes ! Get the paramedics ! Go ! Why did you do that ? Why did you step in the way like that ? Mallory ! He didn 't know what he was doing . He knew . You know he did . Good doctor . MHO 's gonna have a hard time without you . No , I think they 'll get along just fine . At least until I hit the talk-show circuit . You know , the tobacco companies didn 't go down till their scientists went public . Maybe I can do something , too . You start by stopping . Oh ! You know , my son ... My older son , that is , he would never say Zen crap like that . Well , the rich get richer and the poor get a break . Step down . Step down . Step down . Why don 't we sit here ? To your left . So how you doing , Mallory ? I 'm his eyes . Yeah . Thank you . Almost time . Keep up the good work , brain boy . But let me give you some advice . Elvis is getting ready to leave the building . I don 't know about him , but I most certainly am . So long , friends and family ! It 's been a stone gas !

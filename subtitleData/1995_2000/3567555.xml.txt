 Jarod , you 've done this a dozen times before . Choose a photo and become the person . Jarod 's been uncommunicative before , but never during such a routine exercise . And never with such disturbing results . Your merchandise is ... fascinating . That 's the word Jarod used . He was blown away by all the stuff we make . He even tried his hand at some mirrors - the warped face , the torso crusher . - The shattered image was his specialty . - This is weird . [ Miss Parker ] That is twisted . You think that 's twisted , come see this : Jarod 's own house of mirrors . [ JumboJim ] Jarod would stay in here for hours just staring at himself and working . Wow . Huh . - Check this out . - [ JumboJim ] Jarod made that . He said it gave him another look into his soul . Huh . In child development , mirror stage is where the ego is born . The child realizes he 's distinct from his mother . - Identity begins . - What 's it mean ? Jarod 's attempting to reconstruct a shattered personality ... shattered life . [ Owl Hooting ] - Is everything okay in here ? - Fine . [ Guns Cock ] Hi , Nicky . - [ Woman Screams ] - [ Jarod ] Get down ! Take cover and stay down ! [ Woman ] Nicky , get down . ! Get down . ! Get down . ! Get down . ! - [ Woman Yelps ] Baby . - [ Jarod ] It 's okay . It 's okay , Nicky . It 's okay . [ Shouting In Spanish ] - [ Woman Cries ] - It 's okay . [ Woman ] Hey , baby . Mommy 's okay . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - [ Sirens Wailing ] - [ Chattering ] [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Siren Slows , Stops ] - Dr. Leary . - Actually , it 's Agent Leary . Special Agent Roger Bingham . - This is Andrew Stess . - Nice to meet you , Agent Stess . I heard you weren 't here 30 seconds before the bullets started flyin ' ... and that you 're the one that jumped on the kid . - Lucky timing , I guess . - I guess you 're gonna want a medal . Actually , I was just doing my job . - Meaning we weren 't ? - Listen , Freud ... it 's bad enough Davis thinks someone in the department is leaking safe house location . We don 't need him riding us because some outsider did our job . If you wanna be a hero , don 't do it on somebody else 's watch . - Jarod , what are you still doin ' here ? - Commander Davis . I was trying to decide which welcome was worse ... the ambush last night or Bingham and Stess . Look , we 're all under a lot of pressure . Unless that rug rat testifies to what he saw ... the biggest drug dealer in the Southwest walks away . - What 's all this ? - Nicky was traumatized by what he witnessed . This could help open him up and bring him out of his silence . That kid watched Emiliano Vasquez execute ... one of the best D.E.A. agents in Texas . Then a Vasquez hit team tried to kill him ... and you think a damn Slinky 's gonna help him talk . Well , it 's not that simplistic . You see , studies have shown if you take a child who 's been - Listen . Nothing personal , Doc , but between you , me and that shot-out window ... I don 't give a damn about your studies . You got two days to make the kid talk . After that , we do it my way . [ Engine Starting ] [ Raines ] Angelo has been moved . Do you know anything about that , Miss Parker ? - Are you talking to me ? - Exactly one hour after he was moved ... I was notified I 'm under Tower review . As we speak , three sets of Cleaners are scouring my personal files ... my office , everything . - I 'm crying on the inside . - Review sessions don 't happen without a directive . - If I find out you 're behind this - - You 'll what ? Throw me in front of another T-board ? What secrets are you protecting , Dr. Raines ? The same ones my mother found ? - The ones that got her killed ? - [ Wheels Squeaking ] Maybe they 'll get Angelo to talk , or is it Timmy ? [ Woman ] Nicky , I think we 'll be safer here . - Thanks . Hi , Carla . - Hi . Hiya , Nicky . Oh , those are great toys . This , my friend , is my own personal stash of toys . You , sir , can play with whatever you want . I got your Mr. Potato Head , Magic 8 Ball . This is my personal favorite . You know , I 've never seen a shrink wear a gun before . By definition , I 'm a psychological reconstructionist . I use memory and emotion to unlock the truth in somebody ... who 's suffering from post-traumatic stress . Can you give me back my son ? That 's the idea . Carla , in order for me to reveal his memories ... I have to reconstruct the events of what happened that day . Yeah . I work as a nurse ... and I had a few hours before my shift started , so ... I decided to take Nicky and Charlie down to the Laundromat . Charlie ? He 's Nicky 's cat . I put Nicky in a chair ... gave him some chocolate milk . I turned to load the machine , and I started talking to another woman . I lost track of time , and later I heard this popping sound ... - that was coming from behind the building . - [ Gunfire ] I turned around . Nicky was gone . - What happened next ? - I panicked ... and I ran outside behind the Laundromat . I saw a man lying there in the alley . - Where was Nicky ? - He was gone . I looked everywhere for him , while the other woman , she called the police . I 'd warned Nicky never to go out by himself . But his cat , Charlie , he ... must 've gotten out . - Then he went to find him . - I was talking to one of the cops . That 's when we found him . [ Officer ] There 's the kid . ! Nicky ? [ Carla ] Oh , the little guy . He 'd been trapped under the body the whole time . He hasn 't said a word since then . Can you imagine that kind of fear ? It must 've been terrible . [ Wheels Squeaking ] Willie . [ Wheezing ] Einnad , no . ! [ Yells ] - [ Continues Yelling ] - [ Man Grunting ] - [ Razor Cutting ] - [ Grunting Continues ] Hey ! [ Sighs ] [ Hisses ] [ Carla ] Okay , Nicky . Wash time . Let me clean behind your ears . Come here . Reach over . [ Chattering ] I don 't hear this kid telling ' us that Emiliano Vasquez shot Agent Cruz . - Takes time . - Sometimes it takes a good swat in the ass . Odds are better that Bingham 's gonna match six in the next lottery ... than this kid locks Vasquez as the shooter . Don 't jinx me . The lottery 's up to 30 million . You know , the rumor in Washington is you boys thought Cruz was dirty - that he wasn 't tryin ' to bust Vasquez , he was selling to him . And that he was using a seizure warehouse as his own personal drugstore . Rumors arejust rumors . That little boy in there is the only one that knows the truth ... and , hopefully , before Vasquez finds and silences him for good ... you 'll stop playing with all your little toys in here and get him to talk . And what would you suggest I do ? An interrogation ? Something scared the kid silent . I 'm damn sure we could scare him into talking . [ Carla ] We 're all done here in the bath . [ Vehicle Passing ] [ Liquid Pouring ] Hey , Nicky , I 've got a treat for you . Chocolate milk . Now I 've heard about this powder . It somehow dramatically alters the composition of the milk , right ? - You 've never had chocolate milk ? - It wasn 't allowed . Wow . Can you believe that , Nicky ? Hmm . Nicky , can I try ? - Hmm . - [ Spoon Clinking In Glass ] - [ Gunfire ] - [ Carla Screams ] [ Gunfire , Screaming Continue ] - [ Gunfire Stops ] - [ Carla ] Jarod , I 've been shot . I 've been shot . [ Paramedic ] Ma 'am , we 're gonna roll you out now . [ Jarod ] Don 't you worry , Carla . I 'll take care of Nicky . [ Davis ] I want the leak sealed . If that means every agent takes a polygraph , then do it . I don 't trust anybody around here . [ Background Chatter ] [ Siren Wails ] Nicky , your mom 's going to be fine ... just as soon as the doctor takes a look at her . In the meantime , would you like to go with me to check out your new place ? [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] Do you think maybe she needs a safe place ? You can trust me , Nicky . Would you mind if I put something in here too ? This is my mom . I always keep her close . Will you take care of her for me ? There . Nicky , after a while , it won 't be so bad . And you 'll feel strong enough ... to put the hurt in a safe place . [ Jarod ] This house sits on a maze of tunnels . This is just one way in or out . [ Door Squeaking ] Why would anybody build something like this ? Paranoia . People with everything are always afraid somebody 's gonna take it away . - They 're usually right . - [ Door Squeaks ] [ Davis ] Listen up , people . Now , this house has been built on a series of tunnels . Each tunnel connects the four sections of the estate ... with entrances and exits both within the house and on the grounds ... like these drainage vents here in the driveway . I want every access point secured . - Let 's get to work . - Right . - Okay . - I 'll take the point opposite . - Yeah . Get me a real doctor . Who attacked you ? I don 't know . I 'm trying to help you here . [ Wheezing ] Willie , let 's go . [ Willie ] No problem , Mr. Raines . - He 's hiding something . - He 's still delirious from the anesthesia . He kept repeating the same thing over and over . Name " Enaid " mean anything to either of you ? Enaid ? Disgruntled ex-employee ? Possible , but those injuries aren 't random . The attacker slashed this into Raines 's arm . 155 . That 's the room in SL 27 where Raines used to run his experiments . Judging from the violence , Enaid may have been one of those experiments . You think my mother was trying to save Enaid too ? We know she died trying to stop Raines . Possible . [ Broots ] What the hell was he trying to make out ofhim ? Blake , Jackson , where the hell are you ? Nicky ? Nicky , where are you ? Hey , kid , I know you were scared ... but I 'm not buyin your little silent act . You look at me when I talk to you . Tell me what you saw . - Stess ! - Not now . I need to show you something . Hey , why don 't you go to your room ? I 'll be there in a sec . - [ Yells ] - You so much as look at that little boy ... the wrong way again , and his mother won 't be the only one in the hospital . - Your way isn 't working . - This isn 't just another assignment to you , is it ? Vasquez is personal . The way I see it , you are not a bully by nature ... and I don 't think it 's that innocent little boy 's silence that 's eating you alive . - You 're the shrink . - Hey ! What the hell 's goin ' on here ? Just a free therapy session . [ Broots Clears Throat ] No reference to Enaid ... in the mainframe , but I found out it 's a Welsh name . - It means " life " or " spirit . " - That 's useful . I need to know who Enaid is and why he attacked Raines . [ Sydney ] You sure you wanna lock swords with Raines ? - This tactic backfired against your mother . - I 'm not my mother . - Broots ? - Please don 't ask me to search Raines 's office again . - My colon can 't take it . - Relax your backside . I have a better idea . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] Hi . What you doin ' ? Boy , she doesn 't look too good . Maybe I could fix her . Want me to try ? There . Now she 's all better . - [ Door Opens ] - [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Can I play ? - [ Gasps ] Come here . Oh , I missed you so much ! I missed you too . You spoke ! He spoke ! I heard . Oh , baby ! Oh . [ Inhales , Exhales Sharply ] Boy , you surprised me , Agent Stess . - How 's that ? - Well , I never would 've guessed you to be a decorated officer . - What the hell are you doing with my file ? - Let 's see . " Decorated in ' 93 . " But every year since then , you 've been on disciplinary review . Excessive force . Questionable investigative techniques . - In clinical terms , Agent Stess ... - [ Pen Hits Notebook ] - you 're losin ' it . - [ Notebook Slams ] - I 've had enough of you . - Your brother worshipped you , didn 't he ? But , unfortunately , his addiction got the best of him . And maybe he was just tryin to live up to you . Or maybe he just O.D. ' d on purpose , for the attention . - I could kill you ! - Save your anger for Vasquez . It was his operation that sold your little brother the heroin that killed him . Look , I know you miss your little brother . You are so hurt and so angry that you can 't see straight . I need your help . Help me bring down Cruz 's killer . Help me save that little boy 's life . [ Broots Laughs , Stops Short ] What 's Marmaduke up to this week ? Uh . Oh , I haven 't got to Marmaduke yet . - That was a quick butt . - [ Engine Starts ] Since when does Willie smoke ? [ Broots ] I got it ! I got it ! Phew . There 's gasoline everywhere . He was tryin ' to torch this place . - The question is why . - [ Sydney ] He was trying to cover Raines 's tracks . - [ Broots ] What tracks ? - [ Miss Parker ] It 's written all over the walls . " EINNAD . ' " [ Broots ] Look at this . ! It belonged to a Daniel Hilton Minor ... Davidson Psychiatric Hospital . That 's a surprise . Another fun house . - Where are the mirrors , Syd ? - [ Bottle Rolling ] [ Sydney ] Miss Parker , a lot of these prescribed to D.H. Minor by a Dr. Williams . - Some of these go back 20 years . - " Williams . " - As in " William Raines . " - Huh . - [ Miss Parker ] What about this wallpaper , though ? - [ Sydney ] Obsessive . - Methodical . - And wrong . Strange way to spell " Enaid , ' " wouldn 't you say ? But is that what he 's writing ? The answer is in the mirror . [ Broots ] D-A-N-N-l-E . " Dannie . " Who 's Dannie ? - Hey . - Yeah ? - Check this out . - Check the Mexican bank account that Cruz was gonna check out ? - Look at the last transaction . - 500,000 on April 9 . The day after Cruz was murdered . How much heroin did you say was missing from the seizure warehouse ? Half a mil . Mm . There 's no name on the account , just a reference number . [ Footsteps Approaching ] Hey , how did you get out of your r - You couldn 't sleep , huh ? Is everything safe in there ? Nicky ... do you remember this man ? Is this the man from the alley ? Nicky ? It 's okay . Why don 't you go back to bed ? [ Sighs ] If Vasquez is the murderer , how come his photograph didn 't traumatize Nicky ? Well , maybe all your Slinky stuff is workin ' . Maybe we 're just not seeing the whole picture . Jarod has been silent for 36 hours ; however , he 's showing signs of lucidity . Attempting to sketch an image over and over - this woman without a face . I 've decided to intervene . Can you tell me who she is ? I can 't see her . - Who , Jarod ? - I can 't remember . I can 't remember anymore . [ Sydney ] Is it your mother ? Can 't remember . She 's gone . She 's gone , Sydney . She 's gone . [ Broots ] Our boy Einnad is actually Daniel Hilton Minor ... part of a Centre study group in the late ' 60s . - This file ends in 1982 . - Right after the fire in SL 27 . - That 's right . - Once Raines lost Room 155 , he had no place to work . - So he took it elsewhere . - Preliminary diagnosis : mild depression . - What a crock . - Well , mild depression can always be amplified . - [ Broots ] Brain-wave manipulation ? - Mm-hmm . Whatever Dannie 's initial treatment , the outcome warranted drugs ... prescribed in increasing dosages . That 's Dr. Raines . You got a headache ? Lobotomize . And a perfectly treatable illness becomes dissociative identity disorder - multiple personalities . Two of them we know : Dannie and Einnad . Looking in the mirror can be comforting to someone suffering from D.I.D. The mirror reflects the image of a unified self . My mother couldn 't save him . She tried , Miss Parker . She tried . But Raines got in the way . Charlie ? [ Jarod ] Look what I found . Do you know what this is ? That 's a very , very nice hat . And who are you ? Mommy . Well , hello , Mommy . It 's okay . I 'm here to help you and Nicky . - You have a cat , don 't you ? - Charlie . Charlie . Well , I bet Charlie loves to play in the alley . Is that what happened the day at the Laundromat ? I found him . Okay . You found him . And then a man came up , right ? Two men . [ Nicky ] I was in the boxes . No one could see me . [ Jarod ] But you could see them . These men , did they look like they came from Mexico ? One of the men ? And the other man ? Jackpot . Um , Mr. Jackpot was with the other man ? They both had suitcases . And then they switched them . And that 's when it happened . Another man came . [ Jarod ] Agent Cruz . - What happened next , Nicky ? - [ Nicky ] They got really mad ... and Mr. Jackpot pulled out a gun . He shot the other man . Then he fell on me , and I was scared and I couldn 't move . Jarod . - It 's Bingham . - [ Door Closes ] Then the policeman came and your mommy came and you were okay . Don 't you remember , honey ? Agent Bingham came with the others ... and while Mommy was talking to the police , he was talking to you . He took me away . [ Police Radio Chatter ] Kid , you tell anyone - this is your mommy . [ Door Opens , Closes ] Any progress ? Nothing . Transfer 's gonna happen tomorrow night at 8 : 30 . - Why ? - Dr. Shrink 's time is up . They wanna take the kid over to divisional headquarters . - What have you got ? - Dissociative identity disorder , where both personalities ... are compelled to carve out a living space , even if it 's within the same home . So far we 've only found Einnad 's space . We didn 't find Dannie 's . Anyone ever tell you you 're an odd duck ? Duck ? Mmm-mm . Odd , occasionally . - Howdy . - Hey , we 're runnin ' out of time . We nail this kid , and five keys will be waitin in the alley south of Querube Avenue . Brown heroin from the lockup . [ Bingham ] They 're gonna transport this kid tomorrow night in a government van . Here 's the address . I want you to make sure that transport never leaves the driveway . [ Vasquez ] No problem . That 'd better be primo junk ... or I swear , you 'll end up like Cruz . [ Bingham ] No problemo . I checked all the doors . Uh , nothing . [ Whispering ] It 's not the doors . It 's walls . [ Yelling ] [ Miss Parker Yelps ] Make him stop . [ Crying ] Kill - Kill me , please . Please . Kill me and he 'll stop . [ Continues Crying ] I 'm not here to hurt you , Dannie . - [ Jarod ] It 's time to move . - Good luck . Thanks . Come here . It 's gonna be a cold day in June before I wanna see that kid again . - I 'll call it in . - I 'll take a drive around the perimeter . - You okay ? - Thank goodness for paranoia . [ Carla ] What do we do now ? We get the bad guy . [ Tires Squealing ] - Jarod ? - Don 't look so shocked . I couldn 't resist surviving that explosion . I had to see what a little boy 's life was worth to you . What is it ? Five keys ? Ten ? Now , these guys , they think Nicky 's dead . And Vasquez , he 's gonna want his heroin pronto . - I 'm gonna have to kill you . - Like you killed Cruz ? Well , before you pull that trigger , I strongly suggest ... you check out your primo junk . Mmm . Chocolate . Somehow , I don 't think these guys are the chocolate milk type . What 's the matter , Rog ? Cat got your tongue ? Imagine how Nicky felt . He witnesses a brutal murder ... has a dead body fall on top ofhim . Do you have any idea what that kind of fear can do to a child ? And then when it 's all over , you threaten to kill his mother if he talks . Well , he 's talking now . He 's telling Davis all about how you deal drugs ... how you killed Cruz . - You got nothing on me . - Come on , Rog . Admit it . I can stop these guys . I 've got the real stuff right here . Okay . I killed Cruz . - Give me the keys . - Whatever you say , Rog . - Got milk ? - [ Guns Cocking ] You 've healed nicely . Where did you get that ? Handball . Tower review has been given new evidence . Something about my extracurricular activities . You should hire better people . - Smoke ? - N-No . Oh . You remind me of someone I used to know ... someone who looked exactly like you . I 'm not my mother . Don 't make the mistake of forgetting that . We should all be careful about the mistakes we make . Shouldn 't we ? I just spoke with the hospital . Dannie has been transferred . He 's now my patient . [ Whispering ] Why would Raines wanna create something like him ? Maybe he was trying to make his own little assassin , but it backfired . - Only God knows . - God and the Centre . When Dannie attacked me , my instinct was to kill him . But when I looked at him , he was begging me to shoot him . I saw someone who might 've had a chance if the Centre hadn 't gotten its claws into him . You saw yourself . [ Stess ] Looks like Vasquez and Bingham will be going away for a long time . [ Engine Shuts Off ] You think you know a guy , and then you find out you don 't really know him at all . Tell me about it . Hey ! Thank you for keeping her safe . I have something for you too . [ Mews ] - Charlie , you came home ! - [ Continues Mewing ] So did you , Nicky . So did you . [ Mews ] [ Telephone Ringing ] This is Sydney . Do you think it 's possible to forget the terrible things that happened to us when we 're young ? Forget ? Hell , no . But I believe we can use them to make ourselves stronger . I try to be strong ... but sometimes all I see is darkness ... fragments of who I am . - Will I ever feel whole ? - I don 't know , Jarod . I hope so . Me too .

Please , give it back ... ! Shut up ! What 's in it ? No bills ! Really ? - Fuck ! Let 's go ! Bye ! Idiot ! I found it ! Brother ! What are you doing ? I lost my wallet . Brother Matsuba is looking for you . Why ? Tosa will be released from prison tomorrow morning . Boss . Chairman Yokoi has arrived . - Oh yeah ... You 're making me come to a place like that ? Yomo . What do you want from me ? The man ... who cut off your right arm will be released from prison tomorrow . What do you think about the rumor ? Rumor ? - Yeah . The boss is going to retire and wants to tap neither Yomo or Tosa ... as his successor . No idea . Yomo is the legitimate successor . But for the boss , Tosa 's just like his very own son . Furhermore , he saved our group ... This is a really old hat ! The Nakame goup is subordinated to the Musashi group . At that time , it is impossible that the groups start an internal fight . Our new boss can 't be just the one who finished off ... the boss of the Nakame group . You can 't seriously believe that ! Kei . Take good care of yourself . Brother Maeda has it in for you . Taka . I know that , as a yakuza , I 'm a total failure . But I 'm sure that things would change if Tosa was my boss . I really believe that . Tosa ... ! We 're relieved to see that you 're doing well . I 'm sorry . The boss has an important meeting , that 's why he couldn 't be here . How is his heart ? - Not that good . The doctor says a another collapse would be perilous . I see . He 's staying at the Hakone hospital and he 's expecting your visit . His rehab will go on until midday . You shoud take a rest . You have plenty of time to take a nice relaxing bath . I rent a house for you at close quarters . Do I stop here ? - No . Drive on . Yes . Hello ? Hello , boss ! Take brother Tosa in . Yeah , I 'm sorry . Hello ? Yeah , yeah , I know . I know . Yes ! Yes . I remember you . At that time , you were a trainee ... Yes . I still have it ... Out of the way ! It is ... so big ... ! You 're that yakuza guy ... Look at you ! No more violence ! Apologize for that ! Ouch ! Hey ! Let 's go ! You bastard ! Hey ... What do you think of my dick ? Who 's got the bigger dick , me or brother Hagane ... ? Look at it . Take a close look ... Look at the two pearls ... Yeah , I see them ... That 's so awesome ... Brother Hagane is dead ... Who cares ? Come on , show me your pussy ... Apparently you woke up . Don 't worry ! I 'll fix you , and then you will be able to move again . Okay ? You 're not perfected ! You can 't go out just like that , you 're still not waterproof ! If your heart gets a short right now , you 're dead . Do you want to say something ? What 's going on here ? ! - Come on , relax ! Who are you ? My name is Genpaku Hiraga . I 'm an ingenious chemist . Well , some people call me an otaku ... some even say that I 'm some kind of " nutty professor " ... I don 't care ! I just want to know why I 'm here ! You don 't remember anything ? Maybe the correlative circuit hasn 't been closed yet ... Do you remember now ? You and another man were killed . I revived you . Creating the perfect human was my childhood dream . And so I found myself a body to make my dream come true . Body ... ? Yeah . You can get one amazingly easy on the black market . There are a lot of people no one 's missing . And there 's always somebody who just wants to get rid of some corpses ... Corpses like you . Three months ago , I paid 2.000.000 yen for the two of you . Who ? Well ... I just went to an arranged place to pick up the bodies . Somebody told me over the phone where to transfer the money . I don 't know who . These were the rules ! You were in a really poor condition and had lots of bullet holes . But miraculously ... the other man 's heart and your brain were still fully functional ... I waited a long time for a body like that ... Due to my research ... it was possible to connect the brain and the heart and form a human being . You were damn lucky , kid ! Bullshit ! I was fragmented and patched up again ! Don 't worry ! Reassambling head and body is quite easy . Unfortunately , I ran out of money . Someday ... I 'll design your whole body out of metal ... Out of metal ... ? - Yes . Bullets will ricochet off your body . Do you understand ? Your skills are exceptional ! Your left eye can see infrared , and your right one can see the future ! Even if your eyes are removed from your head , they still see everything ! Your ears can hear every sound within a radius of 2 kilometres ! Your physical strength is also supernatural . Even if you have to fight ten men , you 'll surely win ... I don 't need that kind of body ! That 's monstrous ... I 'd rather die ! " I 'd rather die " ? Apparently you haven 't understood yet why you 're still alive ! Do you want me to thank you for that ? No . No ? The other man covered you to intercept the bullets . It was his will that saved you ! Tosa had ... I told you so . I transplanted his heart into your body . He still lives inside of your body ... Is the heart the only organ that you tranplanted ? Arms and legs were also transplanted and redesigned . I also copied the nerve tracks that are responsible for ... coordination and fighting spirit . What else ? The dick . Including the balls ! I have Tosa 's dick now ... Well , yours was still functional , but ... You 're the strongest of all men now ! By no means you may betray somebody ! An furthermore ... Tosa ... I have a request . Can you finish the tattoo ? Onigiri ... First and foremost , you have to eat metal . It 's the ultimative energy source for your body . Is it good ? That 's not important . Slowly but surely , you 'll lose your human emotions . But if you 're overwhelmed by strong feelings all the same ... you may not be able to control yourself . The results are a loss of energy , system errors and a complete short . Just take good care of yourself ... I 'm going to lose my feelings ... ? To love someboy , hating , getting angry , crying ... You can do without stuff like that , can 't you ? Oh , no ... I installed a system that 's going to soothe you in case of emergency . If you feel that your emotions are going to overwhelm you ... In this case , push that button and repeat the magic formula . Magic formula ? Hush , little baby , don 't say a word You have to repeat it three times . What ... ? ! It 's a lullaby . My granny used to sing that song to me when I was little . Defence against an attack from the right side . Defence against an attack from the left side . It 's exactly the same . Move forward . Withdraw . There we are ! Perfect . What are you doing ? ! What are you gonna do ? I 'm going away . - You 're going away ? Why ? ! Somebody killed us . I 'm not willing to accept that . Just don 't do anything stupid ! Do you want to take revenge ? You should be a lover of justice ! Come on ! Repeat the magic formula . Hush , little baby , don 't say a word If you can 't control your feelings , you 'll get lost ! Doctor . I 'm a yakuza . There are a few things I simply have to do ... before I lose my emotions . - No , you 're a hero ! Don 't overexert yourself ! Don 't let your feelings overwhelm you ! It 's me . What 's up ? Red just left . Then go and capture him immediately ! - Don 't worry . I have an eye on every move he makes . I 'll watch his fighting strenght prospering . Did you call the general ? That 's not necessary . Idiot ! What was that ? ! From the hip , understand ? - Yes ! The successor hates nothing more than bad golfers . And as long as you play that lousy , I can 't introduce you to him . I 'm sorry ! - Idiot ! The Boss can 't do anything but retire ... if his successor nominates me for his representative . The successor 's time has come ! - Yes ! Go on ! Yes ! You idiot ! Watch out ! - Yes ! Stop stupid idiot ! Tosa is dead ! Brother ... ? ! What was that ... ? You survived , Hagane ... ? ! A doctor saved my life . Did he save Brother Tosa , too ? Hey , what 's up ? Was Tosa saved , too ? Are you sure ? I see . Hagane . Could you tell the boss about that ? Yeah ? He 's completely sure that Tosa 's still alive ! Yeah ? Brother . Could you tell me what happened ? Who attacked Brother Tosa and me ? No idea ... I want to know why you betrayed us ! No ... ! Hagane ! I ... I just want to take revenge ... Brother ... He smushed my hands ... - Shut up ! Go and tell Nakamura ! We wanted to get rid of Hagane anyway , you idiot . So take care of it ! Brother ! Cut it out , brother . What 's the matter with you ? Stop it . You 're not Tosa , that 's not for you , brother . I can talk to Maeda . You say that you 're sorry , and then you 're in again ! Junji . Are you in love with Naomi ? I won 't let you ... make her miserable . What 's going on ? All of a sudden , you 're so cool ... Are you sure that he 'll come ? - Yes . Is that a blackout ? Hey . Hey ! Patronage ! Well , well ! I 'm here to talk to the boss . Asshole . You bastard ! Asshole ! Just you wait ! Stop ! Is that a monster ? ! We shot him , but he 's still alive ! Hurry up and do something ! Wait ! Let 's talk about it ! I 'm here to avenge Yoichi Tosa 's death ! I 'll revenge Tosa ... No ! It was Mutsumis idea alone ! He set the whole thing up . Maeda did it ! They wanted to get rid of Tosa ! What an asshole ! Who sold the corpse and took the money for it ? I didn 't do it ! Maeda said ... He promised that ... he 'd leave the two bodies to me ! Two bodies ? Right from the start ... ? - He made me do it ! He told me to do in the man next to Tosa , too . He told me that this man ... What did he tell you ... ? ! - This man ... He was worth nothing . If he was dead , we would at least get some money ! They don 't know anything about your skills ! Hey ! Team up with me ! Just tell me what you want ! Okay ? Scum ... ! Hey ! Let 's go ! - What 's up ? This bastard Hagane ! Go and get him ! What ? ! Yokoi ... ! Hey ! Hagane ! I 'll keep an eye on the boss . Finish him off ! Hey ! Show me what you got . But ! First , I think you should see ... that I 'm wearing Tosa 's tattoo on my back ! You 're really cool ... You bastard ! What ... ? ! Do something ! Hagane ! I didn 't order to kill Tosa ! He did ! He did it ! Maeda set up the whole thing ! And you expect me to believe that ? It 's the truth ! I swear ! You have to believe me ! Is that tattoo really Tosa 's ? What does that mean ? Some parts of brother Tosa 's body ... were transplanted into mine . - What ? Transplanted ? Brother Tosa ... He 's living on inside of my body . Forgive me , Tosa ! It was all my fault ! So I haven 't lost you forever . I was so stupid , so goddam stupid ! I was an idiot , please forgive me ! Forgive me ... Hagane . Hagane ! From now on , you 'll do Maeda 's job ! Do you understand ? Let us fight together ! First , we 'll finish off the Musashi group ! Okay ? ! Don 't kid me ! I won 't let anybody pull a fast one on me ever again ! Hey ... ! You 're breaking my arm ! Stop it ! Breaking your arm won 't be enough ! I 'm gonna kill you ! Let him go . Taka ... You can 't kill me with that thing . I 'm going to shoot at you anyway . - I beg you , Taka . Don 't try to stop me ! I have to revenge brother Tosa ! If you want to kill somebody , you 'll have to start with me . I won 't let anybody attack my boss . I 'll fight anybody and risk my life to save the boss . The Nakame group was finished off . Brother Maeda is dead , too . That 's more than enough , Kei . The monster and other tales Disqualified as a human being Pinocchio You can try to hide , but I 'll find you wherever you are . This is the only place that you can return to . Damn it ! Why do I always get bodies in such a poor condition ? ! The Peach Ranger ... still has room for improvement ... It 's huge ... ! It was nine years ago . He left me . He said that together with him , I 'd never be happy . After that , he lunged at those guys to kill them . He was a yakuza . He had to do seven years . He was killed right after he was released from prison . He was such an idiot ! What are you doing here ? I drifted for some time ... I feel attracted to this place . Attracted ? Tosa But I just understood why I 'm here . This place is something like ... my home ... It 's strange . Near you I feel like ... he 's right next to me . But you don 't resemble him in any way ... Hey ... I 'd like to stay for a while ... Hush , little baby , don 't say a word ... What does that mean ? - That 's a magic formula . It soothes me when I get too upset . Why ? He 's been there for three months ... Why ? Your hands are as cold as ice ... There 's some truth in what they say : " Cold hands , warm heart " ... I can 't believe it ... Your hands ... They look exactly like my boyfriend 's hands ... I beg you . Just once ... I want you to sleep with me . I want to forget him ! I finally want to get rid of him ! I wanted to fall in love with another man , but I couldn 't . But I really believe that with you , I could finally forget him . Yukari ... Don 't you like me , Keisuke ? I do . Then what 's the reason ? ! - I can 't . I like you ... I really do ... But my body is ... I don 't care ! I know that you have complexes because of your body . But I don 't care about the way you look ... I love you ! The better part of my body was destroyed in an accident . Half my body consists of metal . I 'm an ugly monster ! Are you scared ? I love you anyway ! No ! Good bye , Keisuke . I wanted to stay longer . But ... But as long as we 're together ... I won 't be able to forget him . I can 't love you both at the same time ... 5 - 5 - 3 Not bad ... ! Things are going well today , aren 't they ? The wheather is great , too ! Deputy of the boss ... How do you feel ? Well , it 's a start . I see things exactly the way the successor does . There 's gonna be a lot of change . You 're pretty ambitious , right ? Hey , caddy ! Pitch ! I 'll revenge him ! Get up ! Hey , is everything okay ? Take care of him ! Hey ! Who are you ? Hey ! Tosa 's girlfriend ? I 'm gonna kill you ! Hey ! Leave that to me ! Brother ! Brother ! Are you dead or something ? What ... ? You 're still alive ! You know that woman , don 't you ? What did you do to Yukari ? ! What did you do to her ? ! I 'll tell you ! She tried to kill the representative of the successor and failed ! Yomo is one of the boss ' successors ? ! She told us your name after we snatched her ! Because of that , the boss knew that she knows where you are ... Hello ? Hey , Hagane ... You 're very strong ... You already ruined one of my very expensive carpets ... What are your demands ? I don 't make demands . I want a lot more than that . The very best . Understand ? You 'll kill the president of the Musashi group . If you succeed , I 'll give that woman back to you . She 's missing Tosa 's back ... she said ... You bastard ! Help me ... Don 't worry ! The representative is really afraid of you . Because of that , he won 't kill the woman . Kei , it 's me . Don 't worry about the woman . You 'll get her back . What about the Musashi group ? Otsuki , the vice president , is going to be the group 's new leader . The representative will be killed . What about you , Taka ? - If they 're all dead , I 'm going to be the boss . Good . That will restore calm within our group for a while . Kei . It 's not too late . Don 't you want to extend the Mutsumi group with me ? That was our dream , wasn 't it ? I can 't do that anymore . Kei ... Everytime I kick up , you pull in your horn . You 're right . What 's up ? I have to hang up now , Kei . Good bye . Go ! Keep on searching ! Hey ! I found something ! Too bad ... He could have served me well . He could have been useful for the fight against the western groups ... Don 't worry about that . Now we just have to find the man who saved him . He has to build more soldiers for us . - Yes , exactly . Soldiers who work for us ... Everything 's ready . - Okay . This way , please . President . I prepared everything for you ... You did ? - Oh , yeah ! Shit ! I can 't believe they want to get rid of me , too ! From now on , I 'll do anything you say , brother ! Brother ! Please , you have to revenge us ! She 's asleep ... President . Have fun ! She 's really good ... Hey ... Let the boy begin . Hey , Matsuba ! Go ahead . Stop it , Taka ! Hey ... She still got all her teeth , but do you want to give it a try ? It 's not so bad ... Come on , purse your lips ! Hey ! That stupid cow ! Damn it , that doesn 't do it ... Hey ! They 're leaving ! Thank you . Thank you . You should try that , too . - Thanks . Oh God , I 'm sick . Go ! Hagane ! That 's too laborious . Run over him . Hey ! What ... ? - Hey ! Hey ! Finish him off ! Kei ! That was really cool ! Clear off , Taka ! Taka ! I beg you ! I can 't do this ... - And that 's why everybody says ... that you aren 't a proper yakuza ! But I won 't run away ! I 'm a yakuza . Taka ... It hurts ... It 's bleeding ... I 'm alive , right ? ! I 'm ... I 'm still a human being , right ? ! Kei ! Good bye . Hey ! Anybody here ? No one there ? Hey ! Hagane ! Hey ! Hey ! All the idiots are gone ... Full Metal ... Yakuza ... Brother ... Is he dead ?

 [ Music playing ] No ! No ! No ! No ! No , please , not my baby ! No , please , no ! No ! Come with me . But my husband . Let the dead bury the dead . [ Engine revving ] Milton . [ Knocking on door ] Who is it ? Who 's it look like , Milton ? Open up . We 've got guests . Mason . We were wondering what took you so long . You had us worried . Well , what have we here ? Found them on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills . Beverly Hills ? What were you doing in that godforsaken place ? The woman is sick , Milton . So 's the child . Father was killed . Yes . Vester would like to get his hands on this little one . She 's a perfect specimen . Mason . The hell was that for ? For making me worry . [ Sirens ] Oh , damn siren . Irritating . Maybe if you take them to the tunnel . Should go through this door . There 's a tunnel about 300 yards . It leads to a large parking lot . There 's a bus waiting to pick you up . Hey . Hey , what 's your name ? Crystal . Crystal . Take care , Crystal . [ Knocking on door ] Oh , who is it ? The AAMA . Open up . [ Knocking on door ] Uh , hold it . The door is stuck . As you can tell by the siren , there 's a defector among us . Check the back room . Can I help you with something ? I 'm looking for a woman and a little girl . I don 't know anything about a little girl , but of course If it 's a woman you 're looking for , Maybe I can accommodate you . There 's nobody in there . Where were you an hour ago ? Here . And why is that machine outside still hot ? I used it to go to South Central to get some bread . I don 't believe you . It 's true . I hate the bread here in Century City and it 's so expensive . The dragon is trying to step on my territory . He could kill you right now if he wants . Pitiful . OK , they 're gone . It 's all I could think of at the time . That son of a bitch . He had to have left when he did . I 'm going to let him have it . Are you all right ? Things are getting worse , Mason . We just received word . The underground hospitals are full to capacity . And the camps say that they can 't take any more diseased . They have to . They can 't , damn it . This disease is so contagious , hundreds Are being infected every day . Saving them is wonderful . But for what ? Only to see them die later from the virus ? Look . I 'm not God . I do what I can . We need a cure . What are you talking about , Milton ? There is no cure . So who 's L. E. White ? A doctor . He announced discovering the weakness of the virus . And then he said something very interesting . The destructacaucus deficiency syndrome , the plague , Is an artificially created disease . It also says 24 hours after he 'd made this announcement , L. E. White was murdered . This is dated November 3 , 1999 . Yes . Two days before the quake . White worked at a place called the Browning Center . It 's right outside of Los Angeles . And he said that his vaccine could neutralize The plague in its infancy . The AAMA knew this . But they kept it secret and then they Had killed and developed their own alternative form Of treatment . Of course , their form of treatment Couldn 't stop the plague from spreading . But it did make the AAMA rich and powerful . People 's only hope of relieving their pain and suffering Is a useless serum created by the AAMA . So in 1999 someone found a cure for the plague . What good is that supposed to do us now ? Our future lies in our past . This way . I thought these were wiped out with the 8.7 . They were . But after years of work , I was able to restore this one . You mean it works ? I just have to fix a few problems . And then I 'll be set . Set for what ? For my trip to November , 1999 to the Browning Center to find the cure . The time transfer can send me into the past . There 's a problem I haven 't been able to fix . I can 't keep the door between centuries open for longer Than 36 hours . When that door opens , I must step Through it with the vaccine . MAN : Open the door . AAMA . [ Banging on door ] Open up . Open the door . Brace the door . [ Gunshot ] Do it . Do what ? Send me back . No . I can 't . I haven 't perfected it yet . Milton , we 're out of time . Look , either you operate this machine Or I 'm going to have to do it myself . OK , OK . You 'll need these documents to help you Find what you 're looking for . But remember this , that machine will bring you back 36 hours After the transfer and the door between worlds Will only be open for 20 seconds . After that it 'll be gone forever . Wait a minute . What 's this ? Aspirin . You 're going to have a terrific headache after the transfer . Matter of fact , you may not have a head at all . I 'm shutting down the machine . No . Leave it on . [ Screaming ] Open up ! Open up ! Oh Lordy , me . [ Gunshot ] Not you too ! Send me back , Milton . Stat ! We 're out of time . I won 't . I don 't even know if Mason survived . Mason is going to need some help . [ Screaming ] They need to be brought in . They found him about 10 blocks away from here . All right , I want three CC 's of epinephrine on standby And a glucose drip , stat . [ Inaudible ] . His eyes weren 't dilated , but still could Be some concussion or trauma . I need more oxygen . Sir , sir , do you know your name , sir ? No concussion . No fracture . No leakage across the terminator . The southern hemisphere of the medulla region Is at 5 % soft tissue trauma , but that 's not the problem . Doctor , I 'm very busy . The guy 's going to live . Maybe he 'll have a headache for a couple of days . Is this why you called me ? No . This is what I wanted you to see . That can 't be . You 've got an alpha wave here running flat line . We ran the electroencephalogram twice . At first I thought I had a faulty reading Or there was a glitch in the system . There 's not a damn thing wrong with the EEG . This is an accurate wave reading . Who is this guy ? There 's another mystery . There 's no ID , no friends have called for him , No one 's filled out a missing person Matching his description . He 's a non entity . And he 's an amnesiac . From what we can gather , given the nature of the trauma , It 's probably temporary amnesia . But that doesn 't account for the alpha discrepancy . To have an alpha wave like this , a person has got to be ... Dead . Yes , I know . [ Beeping ] Tell me you love me , Howard . I love you , baby cakes . And you 'll never leave me . No , never . And there are no other women . - None . - Ever ! No . Ever . Oh , goody . Then I 'm going to go to the bathroom And change into my new sexy nightie , okie dokie ? Okie dokie . Hurry up . I will . Don 't be long . [ Giggling ] [ Humming ] Hurry up , baby cakes . Your daddy-o is waiting on you . I love you , baby cakes . I love you too , Howie . And I can 't wait to see you . Oh , I can 't wait to see you . I 'm waiting for you , my darling . I 'm coming , Howie . I 'm ready for you , Howie . [ Gasps ] Who is this ? Baby cakes , please , I just ... Don 't you baby cakes me . I leave you alone for two minutes And you 're in bed with another woman , you big ... Snookums ! I want a divorce . A divorce ? We just got married . You are a two timing creep . But baby cakes , I ... All I did was go into the bathroom To put on my new sexy nightie just for you And look what you do to me ! No , no , she just appeared out of nowhere . Out of nowhere ? Yeah . Oh , and you 're crazy . No , no , no , listen . Maybe we could make it a threesome , huh ? I want a divorce ! I will kill you if I have to . I want to know how to operate the machine . You 'll have to kill me first . Bring her in . The bus never left the tunnel . It met with an unfortunate tragedy . The mother wasn 't so lucky . Fullock enjoys cutting things with his knife . So will you now tell me ? All right . I 'll tell you . Good . Fullock , Dowe , get in there . And Milton . If they die in the process , so does the girl . [ Buzzing ] RADIO DJ : Hey , good morning all you wild and crazy People out there in radio land .

Come on , please , give me a break . Hey , boy . You trespass . This Chinatown . [ Laughs ] [ Screaming ] Now look at the flame and count slowly backwards from 20 . Don 't look at anything else but the flame . What 's your name , Joe ? Where are you from ? Here in town ? Visiting ? Passing through ? Not from here . Must save the children . Do you have any children , Joe ? The future . Future . Daddy . [ Crying ] Dana . No ! Don 't kill my baby ! No ! A daughter . I had a daughter . Had ? Dead . Dead . Gone . Killed by the dragons . The dragons ? The dragons come for the children . They kill the children . Must save the children ! Count slowly backwards from 10 , Joe . Joe , forget about the dragons for now . Count backwards from 10 , Joe . Forget about the dragons for a moment . CHILD : Daddy . 10 , nine . Eight . Seven . Six . Five . Four . Three . Two . One . So how are things going at the Browning Center ? Oh , great things are starting to happen . You 'll be reading about them soon . Wow , it must be great working for a doctor like L. E. White . Yeah , well he 's devoted half his life To finding a cure for the disease And he 's determined to find it too . What is it ? Your boy is very complex , doctor . I 've never seen a viral infection like that before . Look , his immune system seems to have suppressed it . Yeah , whatever it was , it was massive . Yeah . Well , how 's , uh , how 's his memory coming along ? Ah , it 's still very delusional , you know . He thinks he 's somebody from the future wants to save the world . More power to him . Yeah , well , he 's probably watched Too many Star Trek episodes . Yeah , I know . Yeah , listen , I 'll talk to you later . I 've got to get to post op . OK , bye bye . Bye . Do you have that file on Bob Gideon ? Mm-hmm . You fight with great hate , dragon . I like that . Who are you ? I am the chief medical dictator of this facility . Someone you 'll learn to hate as well . We call this the dragon mind control training facility . You 've been brought here to learn To fight as a dragon for the preservation of the AAMA . For the preservation , in fact , of all of society . Do you understand ? [ Screaming ] Yes , I see that you do . Lesson number one . [ Groaning ] A dragon must learn to endure pain , to defy it . And I 'm personally going to teach it to you . Go to hell . This is hell , dragon . Welcome . [ Background chatter ] OK . Thanks . Bye bye . Station two looks good . Let 's lock it up . Ruth . You got to help me . Joe , you have to be in bed . Please , I 've got to remember . I need your help . Joe , I have to go to another hospital now . It 's very important . When I get back later , I 'll hypnotize you again . Look , time is running out . All right , look . Do you know him ? Do you know him ? Yes , L. E. White . I 've got to find him . He has a cure . But I don 't understand . Joe , you need rest . Sometimes in life when ... when we go through hard times , Our minds do funny things . Start the car . Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go . It 's not starting . Just ... Mason ! [ Yelling ] Come on , Mason . Let 's go . What 's going on , Joe ? Joe ? His name 's Mason . Tell her who you are , Mason . Come on , Mason . Mason , you don 't remember ? Who 's this ? Tell her , Mason . It 's not moving . Get out . Get out . They 're all so healthy here . Who ? Children . None of them have the plague . You remember . The plague . What is it ? I 'll answer more questions after we rest and have sex . We 've fought together and had sex together for months now . The AAMA thinks that 's why we make such a good team . They call us dynamic . Come here . You sure about this ? Your man has 10 hours to perform . I talked to the police , but they had nothing to tell me . I gave them the description of those two guys That you said were trying to kill your friend . That man and his girlfriend just disappeared . Charlie , you wouldn 't believe what happened . I go down to get my car , these people Pop out of nowhere with swords , they 're all fighting . I get ... I get in the car to go away and one of them Jumps on the back of the trunk . I was never so scared in my entire life . Look , you 've been working long hours . Your mind is playing tricks on you . What are you saying , Charlie , that I 'm hallucinating ? No , no , just , you know , you 're a little tired , that 's all . You 're right . Maybe I should just go home and get some rest . [ Gasping ] You 've been brought here to learn to fight as a dragon . For the preservation of the AAMA . For the preservation , in fact , of all of society . Do you understand ? [ Screaming ] Yes , I see that you do . Lesson number one . A dragon must learn to endure pain . To defy it . And I 'm personally going to teach it to you . Go to hell . This is hell , dragon . Welcome . [ Gasping ] Friends . A toast to profit and the plague . ALL : Hail ! My friends and colleagues , before Us is my greatest achievement . Tonight we welcome into our ranks this new dragon . He was the most difficult to conquer . Not because he was stronger than the others , Nor smarter or more ferocious . He was difficult , I believe , because his capacity To love far outweighed his instinctual capacity to hate . It 's made him a dangerous creature . Such a man is a threat to society . But today he belongs to me body and soul . Months of mind control have bettered this dragon And reduced him to his knees . Great credit goes to my trainer here , Fullock . ALL : Hail ! The dragon you see before us once had a wife and a child . They were liquidated due to plague contamination . [ Gasping ] And now instead of an enemy in this dragon , we have an ally . Quiescent and docile . Under my total control . Daddy ! Daddy ! [ Screams ] I remember . Fullock murdered my family . MY wife . My child . He and the dragons destroyed my whole tribe . Except for me . That 's right . They took you to AAMA mind control To turn you into a dragon . To turn me into a killer . No . You defied them . I remember why we came back . We got to hurry . [ Inaudible ] vaccine . The vaccine would destroy the AAMA . No more plague . And Fullock is their insurance . Yes , but I don 't think he 'll be a problem anymore . Looks like I keep killing all your women . One dragon down . One to go . Mason . Mason . Now get the vaccine . Dragon ! No ! [ Screaming ] Hey , watch it . Hey , hey ! Dragon ! [ Dog barking ] Shh . Joe . Mason . Mason , what are you doing here ? I need your help . I have three hours before I must return to my time . When I go back , I must have the vaccine with me . I 've been to the Browning Center . It 's built like a fortress . You need access , documentation , and clearance . All right . There 's one person I know that can help us . Dr. Stenton . He does research there . OK , we 're going to have to convince him of your story . And after we 've convinced him , can you please work on me ? You are asking me to swallow a very big fish . Now look who 's skeptical . OK . Let 's say I believe your story . Do you realize what you 're asking me to do ? To violate security measures and if such a serum does Exist , to just turn it over to you So you can save future generations For crying out loud ? What if he 's telling the truth , Charlie ? All right . All right , let 's say he is telling the truth And the serum does exist and I give it to you . What am I supposed to tell Dr. White when he comes Looking for it and it 's gone ? And I violated his trust . That won 't matter , Doctor . After tomorrow , things like we know them won 't exist anymore , Including the Browning Center . We 're going to have an earthquake , Charlie , a quake Like we 've never known before . And the cure won 't be used at all ? Not unless I can retrieve it and get it back to my time . This file contains all of the security codes needed to break Through the security measures and the vault , Which is where I 'm sure we 'll find the cure for the disease . Just let me get my coat and we 'll be on our way . OK . How much time do we have left ? About an hour and 45 minutes . How long does it take to get to the Browning Center . About 15 minutes without traffic . What happens if you don 't make it to the time doorway . Does it ever open again ? No . Never . Oh God , we better get this show on the road . Hey Charlie , let 's go . Charlie ? [ Screams ] Dragon ! Dr. Stenton to see a Dr. L. E. White . Excuse me . Can I help you ? Yeah , I have an appointment with Dr. L. E. White . OK , Dr. Stenton , I need to see her ID . Sorry , this is Dr. Ames . She 's not on my list . I need to see her ID . Dr. Ames is a very good friend of Dr. White 's And an even better friend to the Browning Center administrator . OK . [ Ding ] Oh , excuse me , doctor . May I ask you to sign in , please . Are you here for the seminar ? Yeah . Well , it 's just down the hall . This the missus ? Yeah . Thank you . OK , the electronics lab should have All the information we need . According to this it should be around somewhere . Bingo . [ Beeping ] [ Bell tinkling ] How about a blueberry pokey ? The main labs are 100 feet below ground level . Now , the [ inaudible ] are the most [ inaudible ] . They 're the hardest to find . All right , just hurry . I 'm trying . How much time do we have before the time door appears ? We 've got 20 minutes . I got it . [ Beeping ] What ? What ? It 's on the B level . It 's the most highly secured area of the whole facility . Let 's go . Open the door or I cut your throat . It 's open . You said you wouldn 't cut my throat . So I did . [ Gunshot ] Hey , you . You ! [ Gunshot ] [ Alarm ringing ] Hey ! [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] Look , Mason , the vault . It won 't open . All right . All right . According to this , there 's an underground passage Leading into the vault . Looks like an air duct . This way . OK , it 's got to be in here somewhere . Mason , look . It looks a little tight , but I think we can make it . Ruth ? Ruth ? Ruth ? Mason ! The chase is over , dragon . I have the last of your women . Mason , the vaccine , there 's no time . I 'll kill her . You want a fight ? You 've got one . And now , dragon , you die . Here it is . Oh , there 's a laser lock on it . It 's going to be a problem . No . No more problem . The alarm ! Security 's on their way . We 've got to make it . Time doorway opens in just seconds . Come on , let 's go . He 's made it . [ Buzzing ] What 's that noise ? The time doorway 's been opening . It won 't open . Son of a ... [ Buzzing ] Dragon . [ Screams ] Mason , look , the door . Here . Look . You go . I can 't leave you here . Come on . Listen to me . For the future , the children . Mason , I can 't leave you . Go . There 's only seconds . Go ! No ! [ Screaming ] [ Buzzing ] RUTH ( VOICEOVER ) : I see the future now with different eyes . I understand the world in a magical way . And I accept that destiny , like many things , is truly unknown . It took the power of a dragon and the courage of a man To give me faith . And I 'll never forget him , the dragon warrior who sacrificed Himself for the future of the world , For the future of our children . [ Music playing ]

 It 's uncanny , Steed . With the amount of stimulants I 've given , he should react . Not a murmur . Good morning , Steed . Hello , Mrs. Peel , this is Dr. Gibson . Good morning . This is a latter day Sleeping Beauty , Kendrick , Jack Kendrick , local farmhand . Dr. Gibson found him on the road . He can 't be moved , not while he 's in that state . Suits me . We 'll be next door . What 's wrong with him ? He 's in a coma , but why ? We 'll be fiinding out . Did you notice his skin ? Yes , he 's tanned . He was wearing these . Tropical kit . Strange , in this climate . Perhaps he 's just back ... No doubt . He disappeared 4 days ago , with 3 others . Only he has returned . I forget , he had this arrow in his back . Flesh wound . It 's probably poisoned . No , Gibson examined it . No trace of a drug . Intriguing , isn 't it ? Middle of England , up pops a man , with a tan , in tropical kit , an arrow in his back . Kendrick . You 've been gone 4 days . Where at ? Listen . Pr . Swain , let me help you . Thank you , dear . You must be Mrs. Peel . Yes , how do you do ? It was good of you to come . Not at all . Something of an acute interest to me ... You 're an expert on primitive tribes . You flatter me . No , it 's an interest . Just a hobby . I 'm an entymologist by profession . My knowledge of primitive peoples is ... I taught entymology in Kalaya before the new government ... Then , like so many , I came back and I 'm happy to be here . Do you know Sharanzai ? What do you know ? Does it exist ? Yes , an odd admission from a Westerner , eh ? a cult peculiar to Kalaya . a more dreaded form of ... voodoo , if you will . With roots as ancient as the world itself . Wait , I think I might have something of interest to you . Yes , here it is . You see , Sharanzai , in Kalayan , means the " curse of sleep " . a curse inflicted by the gods who reside in the forbidden area , protected by holy men . To enter the area , was to transgress , to trangress Sharanzai . Excuse me . Used by holy men . arradi , the " sweet sound of hell " . The sound that precedes everlasting sleep . Professor ... you 've seen victims of Sharanzai ? - Yes . - You 'd recognize the symptoms ? Even better , I can tell for sure with this . You hold it over the victim , if Sharanzai has taken over , round it goes . I could demonstrate if you fiind a suitable subject . It could be arranged . Sir , this is a relic ! One of our mid-tropical , 5 button , broad weaves . - Made for who ? - It 's on fille . - Traveling ? - Thinking about it . You 've come to the right place for exceptional service . No matter the place : jungle , bush , desert , delivery is guaranteed . By plane , motor vehicle , and native barer to the flap of your bivouac . - Big game ? - Very big . all the best hunters come here . Simon Trent , for example . One of our very best customers . Once shot a bull elephant at 40 paces , or was it 30 ... ? - Do you shoot ? - On occasion . I once shot an elephant myself . Really , with what ? F8 at 5 / 100 of a second and a small roll of fiilm . Here . The shirt was for Col. Rawlings , 17 Battalion Fusileers , dispatched by boat . Where ? Kalaya . When ? May 14 , 1929 . This is mumbo-jumbo ! Dr Gibson , we can try ... That 's mine . The car is very uncomfortable . First , I must annoint the afflicted man . Ridiculous ! What do you expect to achieve ? Conventional medicine hasn 't ... Fine , but it 's your responsability . I 'll have no part in it ! Sharanzai ! I 'm sorry , I can do no more . I can diagnose it , but not cure it . He 's in the sleep of the living dead . There 's no way to awake him , not by any means I have . - There must be something ... - I 'm sorry . We 're not in the jungle here , this is England ! Yes , that 's the puzzling part . How could he have offended ? Offended whom ? a curse that follows across continents , the world ... The Kalayan gods , this is their punishment . The man is doomed . He 'll sleep , then rise , to walk the forests of hell . Walk ? Not a single step . He has no reflex action . Still , that is the legend . The dark forests of hell for eternity . are there any members of that tribe in England ? I couldn 't say . I 'll phone the Kalayan Embassy . You can try . In my experience , the government , is extremely unhelpful . I shall try . - Good bye , Mrs. Peel . - Thank you , Professor . The Kalayan Embassy , please . No , Kalayan . K for Katie , a for apple , L for ... Love ? Ex-servicemen 's club . Is that all ? all right , thank you . I 've heard of 40 winks ... but this ! - Same as Kendrick ? - Not even a murmur . You 'll need some help . Pity , I wanted to keep this quiet . I can handle it . I couldn 't leave you alone here ! Really , Steed , I can manage ... I 'm an insomniac . This Swain , you believe him ? It sounded pretty fantastic , but taken in context ... an ancient Kalayan spell ... Could be . Kendrick was in the army , most of the time in Kalaya . Like the 3 other locals . a transcontinental curse . In Swain 's opinion . I 'm beginning to believe him . - What else did he say ? - Nothing . I tried to fiind out if any Kalayans live here . - and ? - Very few . Most of them work in the ex-servicemen 's club . It 's run by a certain Rawlings . Colonel Rawlings ? - Yes , why ? - The tropical gear . Bought in 1929 by a Col. Rawlings . He must be dead . No , I checked . an old stage , did his entire service in Kalaya . He even retired there . Thrown out when the Kalayans took over . His fille is in my car . a native attacked me . a full blown savage , very unfriendly . - Come now . - He was wearing war paint , a knife , the lot ! Practically ruined my bowler . and as for this ... - What 's missing ? - Rawlings 's fille . Fortunately he overlooked my sandwiches . - and the fille ? - No loss . I 'd got enough details . Enough ? To infiiltrate the Kalayan Ex-servicemen 's Club . - What 's the address ? - No problem . See that house over there ? That 's the home of Col. Rawlings and the HQ of the club . - Talk about coincidence ! - Indeed . Take me to your leader . You should have tried the door . Less hazardous . Fine time to tell me ! - For identifiication . - Thanks . Now is it my turn ? Trent . Simon Trent . Of course ! Your reputation precedes you . Bull elephant at 50 paces . - Wasn 't it ? - That 's not all I 've shot . Can 't be much hunting here . You 'd be surprised what turns up in the traps - sometimes . - Really ? Then the only thing to do , is to limit the suffering . - You 're here for the colonel ? - Indeed . What about ? Tell you what , you join us . You eavesdrop . Major , such ingratitude . Without me , you could have been up there for days . I 'll show you gratitude . If I see an elephant , I 'll let you know , all right ? Let 's go fiind the colonel . You 'd better dress for the occasion . That 's hardly the thing to wear . We 'll fiind something to flit you , Major . You 'll become acclimatized . We have undersoil heating vaporization for humidity , and ultraviolets for vegetation . One really might be back in the jungle . One might . Stay close , it can be treacherous . . I suppose you 're a guest . The Colonel . Colonel , sir . There 's a visitor for you . Feels like a crematorium . are the fans turning ? - are they ? - Yes , of course . Smells like rain . The monsoons are coming . and the mud . Filthy mud everywhere . Imperius prius ipse . Empire fiirst . Someone to see you , sir . My colours ! My old regiment ! You weren 't there ? Of course not . I know you . Yes , it 's ... Major ... Don 't tell me ! No . Never forget a name . I knew everyone at the base . I could recite them . Yes , you 're Major ... I know it 's Major . Is it ? Of course . Number 4 at Kimiran . - We met at Salunda . - Regimental dinner . - Farewell party . - Whose ? Yours , sir . Of course , of course . all right , at ease . - What 's the news ? - I bought a plantation . Wise lad . Sound investment . Can 't lose . I lost everything in the coup . What ? This is British territory here ! Nobody 's taking over ! We 'll flight ! - Won 't we , Trent ? - Yes , Colonel . Trent is a splendid fellow . Downed an elephant at 20 paces or was it 10 ? - a drink ? - I am dry . - Major ? - What 's your tipper ? - Brandy . - In this heat ? Your liver will suffer . Keep it long and cool . a touch of soda . The same , thanks . Three brandies . No , the other one . He couldn 't survive the change . Shock softened his brain . We 've recreated his element , exact replica of the old clubhouse . He still thinks he 's there . and you play along . Yes , in return we have an ideal retreat . a nice line in au pair . We have a whole tribe , to make it more real . How did you get here ? Came up river , I suppose ? Tricky that , especially now . That 's better. always is in the evening . Blistering heat ! Times like these , I long for the old country . Back in Mother England . I dream about it , a little house in the country . Hertfordshire would do . The English countryside ! Been home recently ? . Fairly recently , yes . Pastures as green as ever ? It 's uncivilized here . I wonder why I stay . Duty , you know ... Talking of duty , it 's inspection time . We 've got to have it clean . No lowering the standards . We do as if we were in England . - Fleming . - Good evening . Trent , I 've been to the cottage . Both ... Fleming , I 'd like you to meet John Steed , a compatriot who just arrived . Not settled in yet . How do you do ? Our pet rubber expert . He 's experimenting with new strains . Yes , the conditions are ideal . Would Kalaya be a tiny bit better ? I meant in our part of the world . Why here , is Kalaya barred to you ? Steed , excuse us . Fleming ? I want to talk to you about those trees on the north ... You darned fool ! Sorry , I didn 't see him . - Do you play polo ? - When I can . I played n Â° 3 . We made it to the army fiinals at Jedra . - You know Jedra ? - In passing . astonishing place . White man 's grave ... Sticky , sticky . I 've got a snap somewhere , want to see ? Of course you do . There 's all here ... Here ! The army team of 1931 . Fine bunch of fellows . That 's Johnson , behind the thumb . Never could take a decent photo ! Made it to the fiinals , terrifiic flight . We 'd almost sewn it up , when Johnson came swizzing ... You listening ? Yes , Colonel , I 'm listening . Your play . Think you 've got me ? Not so easy . Cards are my strong point . Mathematical mind . Smart move on your part , but ... Snap ! Have you known Trent long ? Splendid fellow . Downed a bull elephant ... at 20 paces , I know . Where did you meet ? Two more , poor devils ! - What 's wrong ? - asleep . - an outbreak . - Sleep ? The sleep of living death . You 've spotted our little charade . It helps the illusion . Not to worry . amuses the old boy . Convincing illusion . Col , I 'd better go . - Go ? - Up river . Impossible . Tell him , Trent . The river 's flooded , no one will take you out in a boat . - Really , I 'm ... - Far too dangerous , and we can 't upset the colonel now . I wouldn 't let my worst enemy go . We can put him up , - can 't we , Trent ? - Yes , indeed . Delighted to have you , Major . another drink ? The dark forests of hell . I warned you . Those men couldn 't walk , and the windows were locked . The European has a literal mind . It demands explanation , logic . In the Far East , I came to accept the inexplicable . I didn 't say it was inexplicable . I dozed off . Someone could have come in and taken the two men away . You really think so ? It 's possible . You don 't understand the Kalayan native , the legend of the curse . I have a question for you . I observed Kendrick and Gibson , and I studied this . Do you knowthe Glossiter Tripanasoma ? You 're an entomologist ! Glossiter Tripanasoma , the tzetze fly . I know , but what are you driving at ? Sleeping sickness is carried by the tzetze fly . - The symptoms are ... - Not those men . I would recognize the sleeping sickness ! I didn 't say it was that . - Of course not ! - But it 's similar . No , no ! Complete nonsense ! My authority has never been doubted . Nor do I doubt it , it 's just that the symptoms are similar . I 've given you my opinion , I can do no more . Good night . Mrs. Peel ... - Steed , where are you ? - In deepest Kalaya . - What ? - Tell me , have Kendrick and Gibson taken a little walk ? - How did ... ? - I sawthem - being brought in . - There 's more . Swain disappeared . - He went out and ... - Have to go now . Up early , Major ! always . Old habits die hard . Yes ... don 't they ? I fiind the same thing myself . This time of day , if I see something moving it 's all I can do to not shoot . Hard on Kalayan early risers ... It 's not loaded . Never load a gun unless you intend to use it . - Good maxim . - Very comforting . Let 's go have some breakfast . Quite a blow , the revolution . What ? Oh , yes . With your plantation and all ... It 's hard to give it up . Indeed . I felt frustrated . I wanted to hit back . Unfortunately , there 's no way to . Quite . Morning , Colonel . Morning . Fine one too . Sleep well ? - Fine , thanks . - Capital . Have a spot of breaker . a word with you . Cornflakes are a little soggy . It 's the journey up river . Might go for a bit of sport later . Pig sticking . We might arrange a chase of some kind . Thank you . Pardon , Master . Juniper tree . Midnight . Sorry , old chap . Rasafii , Lt. Rasafii of the Kalayan Intelligence Service . - How do you do ? - How do you do ? I 've observed you , I think we 're on the same side . - I hope so . - Do forgive me . There 's something strange afoot , and dangerous for my country . Trent and Fleming were thrown out ? Not thrown out . They did not choose to remain . - They do bear a grudge . - They 're conspiring . all that about living dead , Sharanzai , - is to cover up the real truth . - Which is ? Come with me . Nothing primitive here . These men are guinea pigs . Test cases . - Testing what ? - The cunning ... Get away , old chap . Go ... Lieutenant Rasafii . a spy. a dirty spy . Good work , I didn 't suspect him . You spotted him and dealt with him . I like that . - I should do some explaining . - It might help . I couldn 't until we made sure of you . You understand ? We were chucked out of Kalaya , but we 're going back , and taking this . - Recognize them ? - Flies ? a new strain of tzetze fly we 've developed under these ideal conditions . It 's a very special strain . Immune to insecticide . Once released , there 's no stopping them . - You 're beginning to see . - Yes . You 've seen their effect . - But we 're not at risk . - I 'm glad ! a simple innoculation insures complete protection . But without it ... Tomorrow we go to Kalaya ! We 're going back , for good . and taking this along . a thousand of them is all we need . Released in such a climate ... - They 'll breed ... - Like flies . The whole country will be paralyzed in a week . Then we take over . Pretty plan , isn 't it ? This is the man I told you about . Meet the brains behind it all . You look surprised . The incongruity , I suppose . all this in England . That 's our strength . We 've covered up our activity with mumbo-jumbo . Simple , yet effective . and ruthless . Other guinea pigs ? Veterans of Kalaya . We needed to know if they 'd developed an immunity . They hadn 't . No resistance whatever ! It needn 't bother us . Your nice innoculation ... insures complete protection . We better get you fiixed . Olana , get Fleming . Olana , what is it ? Losing your wits ? Take it . The canister ! Trent ! They can 't escape ! What a racket ! Fleming , what 's going on ? Trouble ? a local uprising . Uprising , eh ? Firm hand , that 's what 's needed . Take some coloured beads , always helps . They have the canister . Find them ! Hunting ? Bring us back a big one . Or two , Colonel . Grab them young , the last were tough as boots . Something a bit tender , I can bite into ! Mrs. Peel . You 've had your 5 ... Shocking arithmetic . By Jove , the natives are restless tonight . Bravo , Major . Bagged one ! Come on , we 'll have it stuffed . Excuse me , Colonel . Ugly looking brute ! Over here ! We got her ! I 'll do it . You almost spoiled it . all that work ruined because of you . It aroused me to violence . Me , Steed . Me , Emma . What 's the treasure anyway ? Creepy , crawly , germ laden flies . Back to the old country . Good old England ! Beautiful weather . If you 're dressed for it . They won 't like it though . If the temperature is below ... - They die like flies . - absolutely .

 Fox . Wake up ! Fox ! - Samantha ? - Shh . They 'll hear you . She 's my child ! Shh . No ! That 's my baby ! Get away ! I 'm afraid , Fox . I 'm afraid . Hello ? - Scully . - Mulder , what time is it ? I don 't know . It 's almost 5 a.m. Is something wrong ? - I think so . - Where are you ? I think I 'm in a motel room in Providence , but ... - Where ? - Rhode Island . What are you doing there ? I don 't know . There 's ... There 's blood all over me . - Are you hurt , Mulder ? - I don 't think so . I don 't think it 's my blood . Mulder ? Mulder ? Mulder ? Yeah ? You OK ? I can 't get warm . You 're in shock . Dry yourself off . I 'll get you a blanket . - Do you feel sick ? - No . Nauseous or dizzy ? No , but I woke up on the floor with a pounding headache . - Were you here alone ? - I think so . I don 't know . I don 't remember ... anything . Track my finger . - Do you know what day it is ? - Uh ... - No , what day is it ? - It 's Sunday . - What 's the last thing that you remember ? - I was ... in my apartment . I talked to you on the phone . - That was Friday . - I 've been here since Friday ? I don 't know , but you packed a bag . There 's a change of clothes in there . Did you receive a blow to your head ? No . No . - Did you take anything , Mulder ? - No . No . - Are you sure you didn 't out yourself ? - Yeah . Where 's your weapon ? I don 't know . Two rounds have been fired . I don 't remember that . Mulder , I need to get you to a hospital . You have to be examined by a neurologist . You have had a serious cerebral event . It could be a viral infection or the early stages of encephalitis . If there was a crime committed , I need to know . Mulder , the first thing you need to do is to take care of yourself . Mulder , listen to me . We will figure this out , but first we have to determine the cause . You cannot take something like this lightly . If this is an aneurysm , it could drop you in a second . - Are these your keys ? - No . You checked in alone around noon on Saturday . The manager 's got no record of any phone calls made from the room . No visitors . - Then how did I get here ? - You drove . He 's got a license number of a car registered . Do you have those keys you found ? That 's not my car . There 's blood on the steering wheel , Mulder . The car is registered to David Cassandra . The address is here in Providence . Who 's Amy ? I 'm gonna find out . First I 'm gonna check you out . You have no business even walking around . No . If I 've shot someone , if my weapon 's been used in a crime , I need to know . You are taking a big risk . I feel strongly about this . I know you do , but it 's my risk . - Can I help you ? - Are you Amy ? No , she 's not here . - Is this David Cassandra 's house ? - This is David and Amy 's house . - And who are you ? - The housekeeper . Who are you ? We 're with the FBI . Is something the matter ? - Possibly . Is Amy or David reachable ? - They 're out . I don 't know where they are . That , uh ... painting behind you ... Do you think I could take a look at it ? Yeah . - Who painted this ? - Amy - Mulder , what 's up ? - I know this house . - How ? - I don 't know . I 've seen it before . Does this house have a special meaning to Amy or David ? It 's her favourite subject . It 's the house she grew up in . Actually , it 's all she paints . I 've been to that house . - When ? - I don 't know , but I 've been there . Do you know anything else about it ? - It 's out in Chepachet . - Where 's that ? It 's about 20 miles from here on Route 8 . My parents had a summerhouse out there when I was a kid . If you 've been here , Mulder , I don 't think it was recently . The place looks abandoned and completely overgrown . Mulder ? Mulder ? Mulder , can you hear me ? Mulder ? Mulder ? How can you do this to our family ? You 're a little spy . No ! No ! Mulder ? Mulder , can you hear me ? - What happened ? - I don 't know . It just hit me . You grabbed your head like you were in terrible pain . You were completely non-responsive . Do you remember any of that ? No . - I remember what I saw . - What do you mean ? I had a very vivid flashback to my childhood ... except I was there . - Do you remember anything else ? - No , just that it was very real . Your heart is racing . What do you think it was ? It was some kind of seizure , some kind of acute physiological disturbance . I couldn 't tell if you lost consciousness , but it was definitely some kind of clonic event . Kind of an electrical storm in the brain . Brought on by what ? That 's what a specialist is gonna have to tell you . I feel really good right now . Mulder , you are not really good . I think I 've been here before . What , in your childhood ? Maybe . I don 't think anybody has lived here in a long time . I 'm gonna check upstairs . Mulder . There 's a gunshot wound to her heart . This must be Amy Cassandra , ... .. and her husband . They 'd like to ask you some questions . I told them about your condition . You don 't have to speak to them . You mean not without my attorney present ? I refuse to believe you had any part in this . I had their blood on my shirt . I was missing for two days . I have no recollection of my actions . There were two rounds discharged from my gun . I had the keys to this house , the keys to their car . Do the words " Orenthal James Simpson " mean anything to you ? How 're you feeling , Agent Mulder ? I 'm a little confused . Your partner says you 're suffering from some kind of seizure . That you had one right here in the yard . What brought you to this house ? I don 't know . I , uh ... I think I came here as a kid . You think ? My parents had a summerhouse in Quonochontaug , so ... But you don 't know anything about David or Amy Cassandra ? I don 't remember meeting them . So , the first time you saw them ... .. was when you walked into this house , using their keys , and you found them on the floor ? That 's what I 'm saying . We got plenty of prints in that house , some with blood on them . We 're gonna run those prints , Agent Mulder . Is that the story you want to stick with ? For now . Can you come to the station and elaborate on that ? He 's not going anywhere but to a hospital . OK ... but we 're all going down there together . Agent Mulder , I 'd like you to ride with us . Mulder , I 'd advise you not to say anything more , ... .. not until I take a look at those bodies and the forensics reports . Amy Anne Cassandra , Caucasian female . Birth records indicate her age at 62 years . The subject is 165 pounds , 67 inches in height . Preliminary exam indicates cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest . Powder burns at point of entry four inches below the clavicle ... .. indicate the shot was delivered at point-blank range . Beveling of the shoulder blade is visible at the exit wound . The surrounding tissue is jagged and torn . - There are no other signs of trauma . - Did you see this ? It looks like a pre-existing , superficial puncture wound . Do you mind ? - What are you looking for ? - I 'm not sure . Do you have a magnifying glass ? Thanks . I want to make sure that you do a craniotomy and a histological examination . - It 's clear what killed these people . - Yeah , but , ... .. what I 'm more interested in right now is why they died . What 's that ? Have you jogged your memory at all ? You wanna change your story ? No . Why ? Because I have evidence here that contradicts what you 've told us . I haven 't really told you anything . You said you haven 't been to that house since childhood , ... .. that you didn 't know Amy or David Cassandra . And what 's in that bag is evidence that I 'm a liar ? I 'd like to believe this memory lapse was real ... .. and you murdered these two people in some fit of blind insanity . - What 's in the bag ? - It isn 't your gun , ... .. which , from forensics analysis , seems to be the murder weapon , ... .. judging from the slugs we pulled and the execution-style point-blank range . Is any of this coming back to you ? No . - Can I see what 's in the bag ? - Be my guest . There are two blood types on that shirt . One matching Amy Cassandra 's , one matching David Cassandra 's . Is that your shirt , Agent Mulder ? Yes . Can you explain how the blood of two people you claim not to know got onto your shirt ? No . What about the prints ... .. in the house ? Were they my prints ? You won 't get a confession ... .. because I can 't answer your questions because I don 't remember . You have the right to remain silent . You give up the right to remain silent , ... .. anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to an attorney and have an attorney present during questioning . If you so desire and cannot afford one , ... .. an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning . Do you understand each of the rights I have explained to you ? Mulder . I 'm gonna get you outta here . You 're a doctor , not a lawyer . - Did you make a confession ? - No , only to my own ignorance . Detective Curtis , I need you to consider evidence ... .. that I think casts doubt on Agent Mulder 's involvement in this crime . - What kind of evidence ? - Medical evidence . The toxicology report on Amy Cassandra ... .. shows an anaesthetic called ketamine in her system . Ketamine ? That 's a veterinary drug , isn 't it ? Yes , but when ingested by a person it can cause hallucinations . So ? So I went to the hospital to go over Agent Mulder 's blood work ... .. and there are traces of the same drug in his system . - How would that get there ? - Probably injected . There was a bruise from an injection on Amy Cassandra 's hip . I think if you were examined again , we would find the same puncture . - Given by whom ? - I don 't know , ... .. but the presence of such a drug could explain his memory loss or blackouts . Given the weight of all the other evidence , ... .. I think that 's all it explains . Scully ... - You don 't have to do this . - Mulder , you have to help me out . There is nothing here that points to your guilt . Unless somebody can show me that you were holding the gun that killed those people , ... .. the rest of the narrative is far too convenient and suspect . The drug in your system already suggests other explanations . That I was partying with a few senior citizens ? You 're jailing an innocent man . Well , this way he won 't get lost for two days and do something else he won 't remember . Shot fired ! I 'm a doctor ! Somebody call the paramedics ! He 's dead . I need to speak with Detective Curtis ! Did this officer have a history of depression or mental illness ? He 'd been remanded from his beat assignment to a desk job a year ago . His former partner had complained about his tendency toward extreme irritability ... .. and confabulation of the truth . How do you mean ? He 'd become something of a joke on the force . One of those guys who believes in ... .. extraterrestrials , stuff like that . Do you see these photos ? - Yeah . - Does this mean anything to you ? Should it ? I think it speaks to a pronounced mental illness . The compulsive and repetitive act of removing his own image from these photos ... .. leads me to believe he not only believed these stories but was traumatised by them . You told me this was gonna help explain something about your partner 's crime . What 's that ? Amy Cassandra . Both your officer and Amy Cassandra had puncture wounds at the frontal lobe . Amy Cassandra 's was a deep puncture through the cranium to the dura mater . - My officer had the same thing ? - Yes . I think your officer knew of Amy Cassandra , and his suicide is linked to her death , ... .. which leads me to believe that we 're not dealing with murder . It 's something else . It 's possibly even a suicide pact . You 're gonna have to prove that to me . Not Samantha ! Not Samantha ! No ! No , not my baby ! Guard ! Guard ! I need to talk to someone ! Guard ! According to the corrections officer , he kept everybody awake last night . He 's demanding to talk to you . He shut up about an hour ago . Did he say about what ? I think your partner 's memories are coming back to him . I need to talk to him alone , if you don 't mind . - I heard you didn 't get much sleep . - I didn 't kill those people . I know that . I think I 've gathered enough evidence of your innocence to get you out . - From where ? - The forensics reports . The , uh ... The shirt you were wearing did have the victims ' blood on it , ... .. but the blood splatter pattern doesn 't match the point-of-entry detail . Detective Curtis has been able to put together enough evidence ... .. to make a press statement saying their death was the result of a murder-suicide . - But I was there . - Yes . And I still don 't remember why . I think I have an idea about that too . Amy Cassandra believed she was an alien abductee . - And I contacted her ? - Yes . Apparently . Amy had begun psychiatric treatment that was effectively recovering her past . The repetitive behaviour exhibited in those paintings ... .. was an expression of that treatment . But why shoot herself and her husband ? I can 't say definitively , but judging from an identical suicide ... .. of a police officer receiving the same psychiatric care , ... .. I believe the victims were suffering from Waxman-Geschwind Syndrome , ... .. the symptoms of which are trance like states leading to vivid dreams about the past . Dreams that are more detailed than the conscious mind can recall . It 's also called Dostoevsky 's Syndrome because the novelist suffered from it too . What was I doing there and why didn 't I do anything to stop it ? I can 't explain that . I 've arranged for your arraignment in one hour . By then Detective Curtis and I will have enough forensics data for your release . I still need to know why though . This is the office of the psychologist that treated Amy . - Have you been here before ? - I don 't know , but we found my car . It 's been here for a few days . What 's the psychologist 's name ? Hello . Dr Goldstein ? My name is Fox Mulder . Have we met ? I don 't believe so . My receptionist says you 're from the FBI ? Yes , we 're investigating the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra . Amy was a patient of yours ? Yes . Please , sit down . I was very upset to learn about Amy . A troubled woman who 'd struggled through an unfortunate period of darkness in her life . Are you referring to her belief that she was an abductee ? This term " alien abductee " , although I recognize there is an associated syndrome ... .. and a remarkable collection of shared experiences for those who believe in it , ... .. my treatment of Amy was an aggressive method to access repressed memories . How do you mean , " aggressive " ? My method of therapy simulates an electrical impulse in the brain using light and sound . Did you use this treatment on a police officer named Michael Fazekus ? Yes . Why ? He shot himself in the head last night . Oh , my God . Is this an accepted form of medical treatment ? It 's unconventional , but not invasive . Are you familiar with Waxman-Geschwind Syndrome ? Yes . Did you know Amy Cassandra suffered from it ? Waxman-Geschwind , if you know anything about it , ... .. is not necessarily a destructive condition . Amy , after undergoing treatment , ... .. had periods of extreme happiness and creativity . But you had no idea , you had no indication she might have taken her own life ? No ! Of course not . I have been in practice for over 40 years . I have a very good ethical and professional reputation , if you 'd care to check . That won 't be necessary . I know what you do . I have been here before . I met Dr Goldstein with Amy . He 's lying about more than that . I think he administered ketamine to Amy and you . I think that you were treated by him and that your seizures are a result of that . I think you 're right . Why would you do that ? Why undergo something as crazy and dangerous as this ? Mulder ? Mulder ! Mulder ? My baby ! Mulder ? I 'm fine . No . You do not belong at work . You need to be somewhere where you can be monitored . You are a danger to yourself and a danger to me . - Do you hear me ? - Gimme the car keys . You 're not doing anything until these symptoms go away . Scully , I don 't want these symptoms to go away . Whatever 's happening to me is allowing me to go back into my unconscious . The truth is in there and I 've gotten access to it . What happened to my sister , the reason she was taken , it 's becoming clear to me . - I need to know that . Give me the keys . - To go where ? To my mother 's in Greenwich . OK . But I 'm driving . Fox ! I need to speak to you . What 's happened , Fox ? You 've kept secrets from me . - What 's wrong with him ? - He 's undergone a treatment . He believes it 's helped him to remember things . Remember what ? You said they took Samantha because you had to make a choice . But that 's not how it happened . It wasn 't your choice to make . What do you want to hear from me ? I wanna know what happened that night and I need to speak to you privately . You had a relationship with him . - Who ? - You know who . The man who worked with my father . The man who forced you to choose Samantha . - No , Fox ... - Yes ! You betrayed my father , your husband . Never ! How far back did it go ? How dare you ! How dare you come here and accuse me ? Who ... is my father ? What do you want , to kill him again ? Just answer the question , Mom . Just answer the question ! I am your mother , and I will not tolerate any more of your questions ! You 're bleeding , Fox . What did you do to me ? - I told you ... - I asked you to treat me to recover my past . - I did nothing wrong . - You put a hole in my head . - An electrical stimulation . - You triggered my memory . Yes , as you had hoped . Now I want you to finish the job . Let 's do it . I wanna remember . You 're a spy . No ! Fox ? Fox . You 're a spy . - Where are they ? - Why ? Fox ? Not Samantha ! Fox ! Dr Charles Goldstein ? You 're under arrest . Keep your hands where they are . Bag those gloves as evidence . Read him his rights . Hands behind your back , please . Where is he ? Mulder ? - Where 's Mulder ? - He 's not here . Did you ask Dr Goldstein ? He wouldn 't say one way or the other . - Stop that car ! - Hey ! Hold it ! Hold up ! Hold up ! Open the back door . What did you do to him ? I know he came back here . This is the only place he would 've gone . Did you treat him ? Damn it ! Answer me ! Yes . - Where is he now ? - I don 't know where he went . What was the last thing he said ? He said he was going to exorcise his demons . - Agent Scully ? - Yeah . Frank Imhof . Hi . Is he in there ? Saw the light go on a couple minutes ago . Gotta be somebody in there . - We got here as soon as you called . - All right . The man in there is armed . He 's a federal officer in need of medical attention . He is not himself . Now I 'm going in there . If at any time he should flee that house , you need to tell your officers not to shoot . Mulder ? Leave me alone , Scully . Mulder , it 's me . Scully , leave me alone . Fox . It 's ... all falling into place . Put down the gun . No , don 't try to stop me . Please , Mulder . Wake up ! Fox ! No ! She 's my baby ! I 'm afraid , Fox . I 'm afraid . Get away ! Are you gonna shoot me ? Is that how much this means to you ? Mulder , listen to me . You have been given a powerful hallucinogen . You don 't know that these memories are yours . This is not the way to the truth , Mulder . - You 've got to trust me . - Shut up ! Put down the gun . Let it go . We 've got shots fired ! Move ! Cleared of any wrongdoing in the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra , ... .. Agent Mulder still has no recollection of the events that led to their deaths . His seizures have subsided with no evidence of permanent cerebral damage , ... .. but I am concerned that this experience will have a lasting effect . Agent Mulder undertook this treatment hoping to lay claim to his past , ... .. that by retrieving memories lost to him , he might finally understand the path he 's on . If that knowledge remains elusive , and if it 's only by knowing where he 's been ... .. that he can understand where he 's going , I fear Agent Mulder may lose his course , ... .. and the truths he 's seeking from his childhood will continue to evade him , ... .. driving him more dangerously forward in impossible pursuit . I made this !

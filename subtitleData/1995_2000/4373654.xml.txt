 I.F.F. Says ... it 's the Bacchus . [ Paul ] Bacchus . It 's like Vegas , New York City and Oy all rolled into one . [ Vanessa ] Right now , I 'd settle for a night in Buffalo . [ Shane ] Hold the chatter . We 're still on patrol . West ! West ! West , look alive ! - Damn ! Damn . I don 't know how that happened . - I do . Six back-to-back sorties at four hours a shot . Man , it 's getting weird . I 'm seeing rabbits and squirrels and stuff hoppin ' around my wings . Keep your head screwed on . We 're almost home , but it 's still hot out . Scramble ! Scramble ! Bandit on my 4 : 00 high . West , you got him on my 6 : 00 . [ Cooper ] West , respond , man . ! Respond . ! He 's locked on me . ! [ Nathan ] I got him now , Hawkes . [ Shane ] Cooper . ! Cooper . ! Go egghead . - Go egghead ! - [ Groans ] [ Nathan ] Hawkes ? Hawkes ? Hawkes , answer . Uh , I bashed my head . I gotta rest . I gotta sleep . No , no . You can 't sleep . If you have a head wound , you cannot sleep . Keep control . Yeah . Gotta keep ... control . Keep control . [ Man ] We thought we were alone . We believed the universe was ours . Until one night in 2063 , on an Earth colony 16 light-years away ... they struck . And now we are at war . My name is Lieutenant Colonel T.C. McQueen . I 'm an InVitro , a race of artificially gestated humans . I command a Marine Corps squadron - the 58th . They call us the Wild Cards . We fight when called - in space , on land and at sea . To lose this war means more than defeat . To surrender is to never go home . All of us must rise to the call above and beyond . [ Shane ] Saratoga , we have a wounded pilot . Request immediate attention . [ Alarm Blaring ] Let 's get him out of here . I want him to sick bay now . [ Chattering ] Okay , it 's not as bad as it looks . No loss of consciousness . Pulse strong . Respiration a bit weak . No transient amnesia . Mild concussion . Check his pupils every half hour and his pulse rate and give him two pylaphatimines . Doctor , this marine 's an InVitro . [ Doctor ] Okay , let 's get this guy inside and restore cardiac output . Hey , just checking you here . Head up . All right , swallow . Nathan , get some rest , buddy . Our rotation is up in ... 12 hours . I can 't sleep . Maybe you should ask Wang his secret . [ Snoring ] Are you feeling guilty about Hawkes ? I 'm a hot pilot . Best there is on this ship after - - Me . - McQueen . And if I 'm making mistakes - On a mission , I can only react at half speed . My situational awareness is zero . Lately , in a given situation ... I 'm choosing whatever routes can get me back in bed the quickest . I 'm not myself . I 've lost control . Hawkes could be dead tonight 'cause of me . [ Sighs ] [ Glen ] The enemy is amassing around our position . We should be prepared to defend our troops holding Iphis . We 'll need the 5-8 down on the ground . Sir , you 're well aware that I 'm proud of that fact . And you know I 'd volunteer them for any assignment ... - but they are just - - We are all tired , Colonel . They haven 't had a moment 's rest in months . - Because they are the best . - They won 't be much longer . Men and women are joining the Earth forces by the millions and it 's still not enough . Sir , you know how long and hard those kids will fight . But Roundhammer could go on for months . They 'll just drop . We will have killed them , not the enemy . What about you , Ty ? How are you feeling ? Me ? There will be plenty of time to rest when I 'm dead . Okay , everything appears to be on the mend , Lieutenant . I 'm feeling mended , Doc . I 'm releasing you from sick bay . You 're clear free to return to your squadron . If you feel any discomfort , take this to the pharmacy . It 's Naproxen Sodium . - Any of those , uh , green pills ? - You gave him pylaphatimines ? - Given the nature of his injuries - - He 's an InVitro ! - It was a mild dosage . - Are you aware of the addiction rate for InVitros ? We 're-We 're susceptible at even limited exposure . - Hey , Colonel - - How much did they give you , Hawkes ? How much did you ta - Colonel ! Colonel ! Have a seat . Have a seat . - Nurse , get some water . - I 'm all right . I 'm all right . - Okay , lift your head . Let 's take a look . - I said I 'm all right . - This man is exhausted . Okay , lay back . - I said I 'm all right . Colonel . ! Lieutenant Hawkes reporting for duty . Hey , ' Phousse . Wang . Nate , you 're looking geequed . - That 's my chair . - [ Vanessa ] I don 't see your name on it . - You know that 's my lucky chair . - Give it a rest , you two . Everybody knows it 's my chair ! You always sit there and you always sit there . Hey , Wang , man , easy . You gotta - Relax ! - Get off me ! - Hey , don 't tell me - - Knock it off ! - Attention on deck ! - Knock it off ! - Attention on deck . Five-eight , you 're an outstanding unit . One of our most prized , both in air and on ground . We need you primed and focused in the coming month . You cannot become sloppy . Therefore , today 's assignment ... is to report to the Aero-Tech vessel Bacchus for 48 hours liberty . That includes you , Colonel McQueen . If recalled to duty , you will report quickly and eagerly . Combat gear will be stored on board the ISSCV . Now , I realiye this is the first liberty you 've had in a long while . On board a ship like the Bacchus ... it 's tempting to try to lose yourself . Don 't . You are United States Marines . And you will demonstrate proper honor and conduct expected of the Corps . One last thing . If you go down there looking for something you left back on Earth ... take my word for it , you are not the same person you were when you left home . Dismissed . Whew . [ Chuckles ] - Give them to me . - What ? - The Green Meanies . - No , sir , they didn 't give me any more - They may not have given you any , but I know you have some . I know what pylaphatimines can do to a Tank . Doctors got me hooked once . After my divorce , I got myself hooked . They make you feel good now , but they 'll hurt you , Cooper . They 'll make you violent , irrational , lonely . The sooner you stop , the easier it will be to kick . If they gave you the dosage on the chart , you 're in danger . Maybe you 've got some stashed somewhere , maybe you B.S. ' d your way through the pharmacy ... maybe you bought some from somebody on board , but I know you have them . Now where are the ones you stashed in case somebody found these ? Good . That 's good . If you need help , I want you to come to me . You understand me ? I 've been through it . I 'll get you through it . Let 's go get some R R. Oh , man . What 's in the bag ? - A dangerous weapon . - A weapon ? Man , for 48 hours , I ain 't thinking about weapons , flight suits or Chigs . [ Paul ] What are you doing down there , Colonel ? - Yeah . I can 't imagine you relaxing . - [ Laughing ] You guys all want to get together for a drink when we first get there ? No , Wang , as they say on the Bacchus , it 's every man for himself . Hey . There it is . [ Man On P.A. ] He was the Roman god of the vine . His followers worshipped wine and song . The lover of peace and civiliyation - Bacchus . Son ofJupiter and the mortal Semele , turned to ash by questioning Jupiter 's deity . Here , you are all gods . Welcome to the Aero-Tech pleasure ship , Bacchus . Where what you can only imagine ... we make happen . In fact , where 's Colonel McQueen ? [ Clears Throat ] We have received your request , sir ... and , as usual , have honored it . There 's no virtual reality here . No phony holodecks . Life on the Bacchus is a hands-on experience . Your Earth Forces debit cards will be accepted at all events ... however , you will find that cash is preferred at certain venues . From this moment on ... there is no pain , no heartbreak . Leave the war behind . - [ Chuckling ] - Check your uniforms at the door and follow me . Whoo-hoo ! [ Man On P.A. ] Before you enter , check out our fine dress and apparel stores . Our shop techs are here to serve you . The Bacchus knows you 're Corps to the core . But you leave it all behind when you pass through that door . # # # # [ Rock ] # # [ Man Singing ] - # # # # [ Continues ] - This is just like being back home . What happened to the Colonel ? What could he be doing with his time off ? Forget him . First one 's on me . I ain 't spent a dime since boot . - Let 's dance , Marine . - Every man for himself . Hey , Nathan , you got any cash on you ? I 've been sending all my money back to my baby sister for college ... and I gotta get my other sister 's baby a present and - Thanks . Hey , guys , A.M.F. [ Chuckles ] Down to the boys . Hey . Didn 't we used to go to different schools together ? Sorry . I 'll , uh , make it up to you on the dance floor ? That never worked at home . Is-Is that how it goes ? Hey . Didn 't we used to go to the same school ... only at different times ? [ Chuckles ] Is that like where they 're girls but they don 't like men or something ? I mean , I 'm better looking than Wang , don 't you think ? I 'll only answer that after a few beers . [ Chattering ] - [ Chattering Stops ] - [ Mouthing Words ] Looking for action . I 'm a dead-stroke player going strong for the cheese . Won 't fade with the nits or sharks . Got no time for hustles , lemonading or stalling . Now , who in this room has the heart ... to show me their speed ? They call me Handsome Alvin . This is my house . And in my house , attitudes like yours ... get spanked . Sounds like you got the plums ... Alvin . Rack ' em . # # # # [ Rock ] # # # # [ Continues ] Two shots of tequila and two beers . You got it . West . How does the , um ... the - the girl thing - The thing ? All right , I 'm an InVitro , right ? We 're born out of the tank at 18 years . So we got these , you know ... feelings that we don 't know what to do with . It 's okay , man . I mean , neither do natural-borns . No , but - I ran away from the invitro training facility before they got around to sex . You see ? Yeah . Um ... Damn , Coop , you know , it 's hard - it 's hard to explain , but - All right , let 's say - let 's say women and sex ... are like spaceflight mechanics . - All right ? - I 'm with you . Okay . So , women , like light , are-are relative . It 's gonna differ depending on your - your velocity and destination . All right . No , forget it . I can see where this is going . Uh , I 'm - I 'm sorry . I 'm not trying to mess with you . I just - I 've never had this kind of talk before . I 'll have a vodka martini , straight up . [ Clears Throat ] - Nathan West . - Suzy . - Hi . This is my , uh , buddy , Cooper Hawkes . - Hi . How long are you on leave ? - Forty-eight hours . - Mm . It 's quite a place . Anything can happen . Oh . Anything , huh ? Mm-hmm . [ Giggles ] I can offer what I 'm sure is the top of your list . Where 's the head ? I 'll be right back . [ Man Clearing Throat ] Excuse me . You got anything against InVitros ? It 's a little more . Look , I kind of owe this guy . He - He 's never been with a woman before , so will you treat him nice ? It 's a little more . I don 't mean like that . I just - Don 't embarrass him and stuff . Go easy . It 's a little more . - I 'll take good care of you . - Then I 'll take good care of him . You 've got Green Meanies ? Oh , yeah . In that case , I 'm gonna take real good care of you . # # # # [ Continues ] # # # # [ Ends ] [ Whispering ] That 's a sweet Szamboti cue . You can 't shark me . Two in the corner . It 's been in the family a long time ? Four in the side . Daddy 's stick ? Ooh ! - [ Chuckling ] - [ Man ] Oh , man . A present to his little girl ? Nine in the corner . Or did he leave it to you before you died ? He left it for me . His spirit lives in this stick . How 'd he die ? Artificial Intelligence killed him and my mother . You know , it 's kind of rude , you walk into my house , turn into King Kong , run four straight . No chance for me to take back the cheese . Hey , I 'll just run the table all night . You break . Shame what happened to your parents . You shouldn 't let a couple of rotten apples spoil it for the whole bunch of us . A stinkin ' A.I. ? Aero-Tech bought me to be the player here . Model-Alvin EL 1543 . Programmed to play billiards and do impersonations . Do you know who Clint Eastwood is ? Do ya ? Four in the corner . Under the spreading chestnut tree , the village smithy stands . - What 's with the poem ? - My high school coach wanted me to shoot with the same rhythm ... so he made me say this poem . Now I can 't shoot without it in my head . I lost the Chicago inner-city play-offs because I forgot the line ... " with large and sinewy hands . " With two seconds left , hit nothing but iron . What are you doing in here anyway ? I saw that girl you were dancing with . Pretty cute . Yeah , but I guess with only two days left ... I wanted to do something that I 'd really do at home , you know ? Yeah . I know what you mean . I was never much for clubs . I 'm kind of a loner . I spent a lot of time in my driveway just shooting free throws and thinking about stuff . - [ Chuckling ] - What ? I don 't know . I guess it 's just weird thinking about you at home in a driveway . I guess I 've always thought of you as some long-gone hard charger . Really ? Well , yeah , it 's kind of hard to think of you in anything other than a flight suit . - What ? - [ Chuckles ] I had this really weird thing happen in the club . 'Cause I saw you dancing with that girl ... but I didn 't recognize you because of your new clothes ... and I thought , " Ooh , look at that guy . " [ Giggling ] Then , of course , I got all embarrassed when I realized it was you . Nothing but net . You weren 't looking at the net . I probably should be . Mm . Mm . You can do anything but kiss me , Lieutenant . I got to save something for the men I fall in love with . Have-Have many men gotten to kiss you ? Not many . - You kiss many girls ? - No . I 'd really like to , though , before I get killed in this war . You know how many times I 've heard that one , Marine ? Heard that one what ? You can kiss me . Not on the lips , though . Start there . [ Moans ] Ears are nice . You know one thing , Lieutenant . Every girl 's weak spot is the back of her neck . You - You 're - You 're - You 're an InVitro . Believe me , Lieutenant ... an InVitro 's first time should be with one of their own . Natural-borns can get squeamish . And we know just how to treat each other . No more Meanies ? Hmm ? No . [ Chattering , Laughing ] - # # # # [ Piano ] - [ Dog Barking ] [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] [ W.C. Fields ] # # Tambourine # # [ Man ] That certainly is a sad song . [ Sobbing ] Don 't cry , Constable . [ W.C. Fields ] It is a sad song . Yeah , all right . Come on . Movies aren 't as good when you 're alone , anyway . [ W.C. Fields ] It ain 't no place for women gals . - But pretty men go there . - [ Sobbing ] [ Laughing ] Well , I think I 'll be a high tailing ' it over the rim . And it ain 't a fit night out for man or beast . Otto ! Heave ! - [ Barks ] - Otto . ! Game . That 's your last C-note . I guess you had enough . You know , I got you off your game once it wasn 't about money anymore . And now you ain 't got no more money . That 's what you get for coming into my house ... and shooting off your mouth better than you do the balls . [ Alvin ] Looks like you got some stake horses . What do you say , one more game ? Do you feel lucky ? [ Groans ] Bathroom . Shut the door . Shut that door ! [ Baby Crying ] - Is that yours ? - Get out ! - You got a kid living here ? - I couldn 't leave him back on Earth . Now get out ! And you 're downing Green Meanies ? Tanks can 't handle them . - You do them . - I 'm not a mom . - I don 't have anybody that needs me . - Just shut up ! They make me escape myself . It 's the only way I can handle how I make this much money . Escape from yourself ? Handle ? What do you do ? I am paid to be with men like you . Three in the corner . - Four in the side . - [ Pool Balls Clack ] Here . Let me help . [ Alvin ] Game . [ Alarm Blaring ] [ P.A. ] All hands , now hear this . This is Commodore Ross of the U.S.S. Saratoga . All hands are to report immediately to duty . I say again . Report immediately to active duty . That 's game . Now , where 's the gift shop ? I gotta get out of here . I 'm in a hurry . [ Man On P.A. ] All units , liberty is over . 58th Squadron , report bay 7 , shuttle 4 . Hey . Thanks for the cheese , Alvin . 41 st Fighter Squadron , your departure is - [ Continues ] Gotta keep control . Control . Get out ! - Put ' em back . - I 'll give you money for ' em . - [ Baby Crying ] - This time it 's going where it belongs . Escape from myself . - [ Gunfire , Explosions ] - [ Man ] Move , move . ! [ Vanessa ] That 's Bacchus pulling away from the area . I wonder if we 'll ever make it back . 51 st MEU in defensive position on planet Iphis . Grid coordinates - 5088 . [ McQueen ] Okay , listen up . Chig ground forces are moving toward our position , 12 : 00 . This one 's going to be smash mouth . We hold this line and we advance meeting Third Force advancing on our right flank . This is important ground , people . Iphis cannot be lost . Look alive ! Ain 't a fit night out for man or beast . [ Nathan ] Incoming . ! [ Weapons Firing , Explosions ] Hawkes ! No ! We need you , man . - Get away ! - I 'm not the enemy , man , and neither are you . [ Growling ] This is no time to escape . We need you . - We need you , Hawkes . - I need one . We don 't need anybody else . We need you ! I need one . I can 't get through this . I got to get through this ! - [ Groaning ] - [ Weapons Firing ] Lieutenant , this marine is out of action . You keep him buried until we can extract . [ Groaning ] I 'm with you , Coop . Just stay down , man . We 're pinned . I 'm right here . Vansen ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Yeah . Charlie One to command . We are in deep serious . High Angle Hell is at bull 's-eye . Advise . Can I get you two a room ? What the hell 's going on here ? [ Weapons Firing , Explosions ] No ! I 'm gonna help you ride this out . Hawkes ! - Hawkes . ! Hawkes . ! - Get back ! I could of had ' em ! [ Screaming ] Come on , Coop , get up ! Get up ! Hear me , CFV . Liberty is over ! All of you , get off the Bacchus . There is there and here is here . It is not every man for himself . You cannot lose yourselves . If you lose yourself here , you lose yourself forever . Sir , command reports engagement helped us break from undercover . Third Force has broken through the Chig flank . We 're backing them up . They are ordering us to move . Sir , it was Hawkes . It wasn 't anyone else . It was Hawkes . He had it under control . I 'm here . No every man for himself . Grab your gear . Send it down the line . This is it ! Let 's make it happen ! Move ! [ McQueen ] On your left . There 's two on the left . Forward . ! Forward . ! - Off to the left . - [ Screaming ] [ McQueen ] Here are the options . I 'll ship you Earthside . You serve out the rest of your time behind a desk . Because of your actions on the planet , however ... the commodore is willing to place you on supervised sick leave aboard the Saratoga . If you kick it , you 're back . Supervised ? Some doctors ... and me . If you do it , you 'll go through hell . How badly do you want to remain a part of the 58th ? They 're the only family I ever had . I , uh , I thought you were in more urgent need of one than my niece . [ Clears Throat ] [ Sighs ] - Hey . - Hi . - I was , uh , just on my way to see - - Me too . - Shoot any hoops lately ? - No . No . The Saratoga 's gym is still set up for volleyball . Yeah , I guess a lot of things have to be different on the Saratoga than on the Bacchus . Look , I don 't regret what happened for a second , but - But the moment on the planet , it ju - It just really wasn 't like it was on R R. Some R R. Come on . Let 's go see Coop . - [ Vanessa ] Hey , Coop . How you doing , big guy ? - Hey , Hawkes . [ Paul ] You 're looking pretty good . Pretty geeque there , buddy . I , uh , know we 're supposed to leave the Bacchus behind ... but I brought something back I thought could make things a little easier ... for all of us . [ Machine Whirs ] [ W.C. Fields ] I always said something to make you split your sides a-laughing . - [ Man Sobbing ] - Powerful little gentleman , he was . Well , I think I 'll be a high tailing 'it over the rim . - [ Wind Blowing ] - [ Chuckling ] And it ain 't a fit night out for man or beast . [ Chuckling ] [ Man Sobbing ] - Otto . ! - [ Dogs Barking ] Hey , heave . ! Otto . ! Hey . ! Otto . ! Hey . ! [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

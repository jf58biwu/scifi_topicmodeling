[ Man On Radio , Indistinct ] [ Man On Radio ] ALL UNITS RESPONDING TO RUSKIN DAM : WE HAVE NUMEROUS BODIES . REPEAT , NUMEROUS BODIES . WE 'RE COMING IN FOR A CLOSER LOOK . [ Man Continues , Indistinct ] WE 'RE LOOKING FOR SURVIVORS . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Sirens Wailing ] [ People Shouting , Radio Chatter ] AGENT MULDER ! WAS SHE HERE ? IS SHE HERE ? - YES , AND THE MEDICS ARE ALL OVER HER . - SHE 'S ALIVE . THEY 'RE WORKING ON HER NOW . COME ON . AN S.A.R. CHOPPER PILOT FOUND HER HUDDLED IN THE WOODS THIS MORNING ... WITH ABOUT 50 OTHER SURVIVORS . SHE HAS MINOR BURNS , BUT HER FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES WERE ABNORMALLY DEPLETED . SCULLY ? SHE 'S IN VASOGENIC SHOCK . UNLESS YOU GENTS ARE DOCTORS , YOU 'RE IN THE WAY . THIS WOMAN NEEDS TO GET TO A HOSPITAL . ON THREE . ONE , TWO , THREE . WHAT HAPPENED HERE , AGENT MULDER ? THE ANSWER JUST GOT LOADED ONTO THAT CHOPPER . CAN I TALK TO YOU , PLEASE ? IS SHE HERE ? WAS SHE FOUND ? WHO ? - AGENT SPENDER ? - MY MOTHER . I 'M FAIRLY CERTAIN IT 'S NOT A QUESTION OF DOSAGE . WE 'VE ADMINISTERED THREE INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTIONS OVER THE PAST 20 HOURS ... SINCE WE FOUND HER ON THE ROADSIDE . AND YOU 'VE SEEN NO EFFECT ? NO . IT DOESN 'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL . MMM . - MM , WHAT TIME IS IT ? - " WHAT TIME IS IT ? " IT 'S TIME TO THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS . - WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING ? - I 'M NOT LAUGHING AT YOU . I 'M JUST VERY HAPPY TO BE STANDING HERE TALKING TO YOU , THAT 'S ALL . MULDER , WHAT AM I DOING HERE ? YOU WERE AIRLIFTED HERE ... IN VASOGENIC SHOCK . FROM WHAT ? YOU 'VE GOT SOME FIRST-DEGREE BURNS ... AND SCORCHING ON YOUR HANDS AND FACE . FROM WHAT ? YOU DON 'T REMEMBER ? MULDER- - - IS ANY OF THIS COMING BACK TO YOU ? - I WAS THERE ? - WELL , DOING WHAT ? - I WAS HOPING YOU WERE GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME . [ Door Opening ] YOU SHOULDN 'T BE ELEVATED , MISS SCULLY . NOT UNTIL WE CAN GET YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE BACK UP . SHE REALLY NEEDS HER REST . - I 'LL COME BACK . - WELL , MULDER- - THEY DIDN 'T FIND HER . SHE WASN 'T AMONG THE VICTIMS . THEY ONLY FOUND HER WHEELCHAIR . I 'M SORRY . WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH HER ? WHAT WAS I DOING WITH HER ? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS ? MY MOM 'S A CRIPPLE . SHE HASN 'T DRIVEN A CAR FOR I DON 'T KNOW HOW LONG . THEY FOUND HER WHEELCHAIR 130 MILES FROM THE HOSPITAL , WHERE I 'M NOW TOLD AGENT SCULLY WAS MEETING WITH HER PRIVATELY . LOOK . NO , YOU LOOK ! SHE 'S MY MOTHER . SHE 'S NOT SOME TEST SUBJECT OF YOURS . YOUR MOTHER WILL BE FOUND . ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU TO LEAVE IT ALONE . IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK ? [ Footsteps ] [ Gasps ] YOU 'RE PROBABLY THIRSTY . [ Coughing ] REMIND ME TO COMPLAIN TO THE CAPTAIN ABOUT THE SERVICE . YOU MAY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY . [ Coughing ] THIS SHIP IS BOUND BACK TO VLADIVOSTOK TOMORROW . I GATHER THERE WILL BE QUITE AN ENTHUSIASTIC HOMECOMING . [ Spits ] DO YOU HAVE THE BOY ? NO . MISS COVARRUBIAS TOOK HIM . YOUR ALLIANCE WITH HER WAS AS MISGUIDED AS OURS , BUT IT APPEARS SHE WAS UNAWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER DECEPTION . YOU WERE CLEVER . INFECT THE BOY TO INSURE INFECTION OF ANYONE ... WHO TRIED TO LEARN WHAT HE KNOWS , WHO WOULD CHEAT YOU . - AND WHERE 'S THE BOY ? - DEAD . VICTIM OF ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS HOLOCAUST . UNABLE NOW TO TELL WHAT HE KNEW OR SAW . THEN YOU GOT NO CHOICE BUT TO DEAL WITH ME . I 'M AFRAID THERE 'S NO DEAL TO BE MADE . I 'M THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THOSE INCIDENTS ARE , WHAT THEY MEAN . I KNOW WHAT THAT BOY SAW . - YOU 'VE AS MUCH AS TOLD ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW . - YOU KNOW NOTHING . IF THE BOY WAS YOUR TRUMP CARD , WHY INFECT HIM UNLESS YOU COULD ALSO CURE HIM ... WITH A VACCINE DEVELOPED BY THE RUSSIANS ? ONE THAT WORKS . IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE RESISTANCE TO THE ALIEN COLONISTS IS NOW POSSIBLE . - YOU 'RE DREAMING . - DO YOU HAVE THE VACCINE ? - YOU NEED WHAT I KNOW . - DO YOU HAVE THE VACCINE ? GIVE YOU THE MEANS TO SAVE COVARRUBIAS AFTER WHAT SHE DID ? THE MEANS TO SAVE YOURSELF . [ Sirens Blaring ] I DON 'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY . I MEAN , I DON 'T HAVE THE FIRST CLUE . THERE 'S NOTHING HERE . [ Sighs ] WELL , AT LEAST YOU 'RE NOT ALONE . NONE OF THE OTHER SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE A COGENT ACCOUNT EITHER . MULDER , I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE . I COULDN 'T TELL YOU HOW TO GET HERE , LET ALONE DRIVE IT . - DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU LAST SAW CASSANDRA SPENDER ? - SHE WAS THERE TOO ? I RAN MORE X RAYS . I HAVEN 'T TOLD ANYBODY YET WHAT I FOUND , THOUGH . YOU FOUND MORE IMPLANTS ? THAT WOULD EXPLAIN HOW YOU WERE DIRECTED TO THE SITE AND WHY YOU CAN 'T REMEMBER . THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE SENSATION CASSANDRA SPENDER WAS DESCRIBING , HER ABDUCTION FANTASIES , IT WOULD EXPLAIN SKYLAND MOUNTAIN . BUT IT WOULDN 'T EXPLAIN WHY THEY WOULD WANT TO KILL ME . AND IT DOESN 'T EXPLAIN WHY I SURVIVED . IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A QUESTION , ONE THAT HASN 'T BEEN ANSWERED ... OR I DON 'T EVEN THINK HONESTLY ADDRESSED . WHO MADE THAT CHIP IN YOUR NECK ? THAT CHIP WAS FOUND IN A MILITARY RESEARCH FACILITY . OUR GOVERNMENT MADE THAT CHIP , IMPLANTED IT IN YOUR NECK AS PART OF A SECRET MILITARY PROJECT ... TO DEVELOP A BIOCHEMICAL WEAPON , TO MONITOR YOUR IMMUNITY ... OR TO DESTROY YOU LIKE A LAB RAT ... IF THE TRUTH WERE TO BE EXPOSED . YOUR CANCER , YOUR CURE . EVERYTHING THAT 'S HAPPENING TO YOU NOW . IT ALL POINTS TO THAT CHIP . THE TRUTH I 'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ? THAT TRUTH ISINYOU . MULDER , WHEN I MET YOU FIVE YEARS AGO , YOU TOLD ME THAT YOUR SISTER HAD BEEN ABDUCTED ... BY ALIENS . THAT THAT EVENT HAD MARKED YOU SO DEEPLY ... THAT NOTHING ELSE MATTERED . I DIDN 'T BELIEVE YOU , BUT I FOLLOWED YOU ... ON NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR FAITH THAT THE TRUTH WAS OUT THERE , BASED NOT ON FACTS , NOT ON SCIENCE , BUT ON YOUR MEMORIES ... THAT YOUR SISTER HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM YOU . YOUR MEMORIES WERE ALL THAT YOU HAD . I DON 'T TRUST THOSE MEMORIES NOW . WHETHER YOU TRUST THEM OR NOT , THEY LED YOU HERE ... AND ME . BUT I HAVE NO MEMORIES TO EITHER TRUST OR DISTRUST . AND IF YOU ASK ME NOW TO FOLLOW YOU AGAIN , TO STAND BEHIND YOU IN WHAT YOU NOW BELIEVE ... WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED TO ME OUT THERE- - WITHOUT THOSE MEMORIES , I CAN 'T . I WON 'T . IF I COULD GIVE YOU THOSE MEMORIES , IF I COULD PROVE THAT I WAS RIGHT AND THAT WHAT I BELIEVED FOR SO LONG WAS WRONG- - IS THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT ? THE FACIAL SCARRINGS APPEAR TO BE SELF-MUTILATION , DONE AS PROTECTION . PROTECTION AGAINST WHAT ? INFECTION BY THE BLACK OIL . HE WAS THE LONE SURVIVOR OF A CRASHED SPACECRAFT ... AT A MILITARY BASE IN WEST VIRGINIA . WHAT THE HELL IS HE ? AN ALIEN REBEL . THIS IS WHAT THE BOY SAW IN RUSSIA , THE LAST FACE THE DEAD SAW AT SKYLAND MOUNTAIN , AND MOST SURELY ... WHO KILLED OUR MAN AT THE DAM IN PENNSYLVANIA . HE 'S A RESISTANCE FIGHTER AGAINST THE ALIEN COLONISTS . THIS IS WHAT ALEX KRYCEK KNEW- - THAT A WAR HAD BEGUN . WHAT GOOD WAS THAT KNOWLEDGE ? WITHOUT THE VACCINE AGAINST THE BLACK OIL , NO ONE CAN SURVIVE . WE HAVE A VACCINE- - DEVELOPED BY THE RUSSIANS , STOLEN BY KRYCEK , GIVEN TO ME . YOU SEE WHAT THIS MEANS ? RESISTANCE IS POSSIBLE . WE HAVE THE WEAPONS AND THE MAGIC IN HAND . WE DON 'T KNOW THE VACCINE WORKS . IT WILL , AND IF IT DOESN 'T , WE HAVE A NEW ALLIANCE TO BE MADE . - SIDE WITH THE RESISTANCE ? - SUICIDE . THEY 'LL SQUASH US AS THEY DO THEM . WE MUST TURN THE REBEL OVER . BUT FIRST , WAIT TILL WE KNOW THE VACCINE WORKS . [ Knocks On Glass ] HI , DANA . IT 'S NICE TO MEET YOU AGAIN . ARE YOU OKAY WITH THIS ? I 'M OKAY . THERE ARE A FEW THINGS ... I WANT TO SAY I DIDN 'T TOUCH ON OVER THE PHONE . I 'M SURE AGENT MULDER TOLD YOU ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS . HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HYPNOTIZED ? UH , ONCE . BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU . I DIDN 'T HAVE MUCH LUCK . WELL , I HOPE WE CAN DO BETTER TODAY . I 'M GOING TO BE USING SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT . YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HYPNAGOGIC TRANCE , WHICH IS JUST A LIGHT TRANCE STATE ... WHERE WE RELAX SOME OF THE FILTERING PROCESSES . OKAY ? I 'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GO BACK TO THE PLACE WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PHONE . JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES ... AND TAKE LONG , DEEP BREATHS , RELAXING ALL PARTS OF YOUR BODY . LONG , DEEP BREATHS . RELAXING YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FEET . RELAXING YOUR JAW , YOUR PELVIS . LONG , DEEP BREATHS . BACK TO THE " NIGHT PLACE . " [ Scully ] I DON 'T THINK THIS IS WORKING . OH , MY GOD ! OH , MY GOD ! - OH , MY GOD ! - WHERE ARE YOU , DANA ? OH- - I 'M , UH- - [ Panting ] I 'M WITH THE OTHERS . - ARE YOU IN THE " NIGHT PLACE " ? - YES . [ Rumbling ] AND THEN- - AND THEN IT WAS GONE . OH- - OH ! OH- - [ Dr. Werber ] WHAT IS IT , DANA ? IT 'S , UH- - - THEY 'RE BACK . - WHO ? OH , NO , TH-THEY 'RE ON FIRE ! OH , GOD . THEY 'RE SETTING THEM ON FIRE . I CAN 'T- - WHO ? WHO 'S DOING THIS ? THEIR FACES- - I CAN 'T- - THEY HAVE NO FACES . I- - THEY HAVE NO EYES . OH , GOD , THEY 'RE COMING AT US . [ People Screaming ] THEY 'RE SURROUNDING US . THEY WON 'T STOP . THEY WON 'T STOP IT . OH . THERE 'S- - THERE 'S ANOTHER ONE . THERE 'S ANOTHER SHIP . THEY SEE IT . - THEY WERE ATTACKING THEM . - [ Werber ] WHO WERE THEY ATTACKING , DANA ? THE FACELESS MEN . THEY 'RE- - - MY GOD , I CAN 'T- - - DO YOU WANT TO STOP , DANA ? NO . NOW IT 'S COMING AT US . OH , MY GOD ! - NO . CASSANDRA ! - WHERE IS CASSANDRA ? THEY 'RE- - THEY 'RE TAKING HER . THEY 'RE- - OH , MY GOD . I CAN 'T- - DANA ? DANA , I 'M GOING TO STOP NOW . - I WANT YOU TO OPEN YOUR EYES . - NO , I- - I WANT YOU TO OPEN YOUR EYES , DANA , AND COME ON BACK . DANA , I WANT YOU TO OPEN YOUR EYES AND COME BACK TO US . OKAY . OH , GOD . WE 'VE BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME ? I , UH , REVIEWED THE TAPE OF THE SESSION AS YOU REQUESTED . I HAVE TO SAY I WASN 'T PREPARED FOR WHAT I HEARD ON THIS . NO , SIR , NEITHER WAS I. AGENT MULDER ? I 'M FAMILIAR WITH THE REGRESSION PROCESS IN DR. WERBER 'S WORK . I 'VE HEARD HUNDREDS OF THOSE TYPES OF ABDUCTION SCENARIOS . WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS ONE ? THE IMAGERY IS STARTLING BUT NOT ATYPICAL . BRIGHT LIGHTS , WEIGHTLESSNESS , STOLEN MEMORY , LOST TIME ... EXPRESSED AS A CLOSE ENCOUNTER , AN ABDUCTION , RELIGIOUS RAPTURE AS A DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL . " EXPRESSED " ? [ Mulder ] DESCRIBED AND THEN INTERPRETED INTO A LINEAR NARRATIVE . A GESTALT IMPRESSION OF A SUBJECTIVE NONLINEAR EXPERIENCE . - AND YOUR INTERPRETATION ? - THAT AGENT SCULLY WITNESSED A VERY POWERFUL EVENT ... NOT UNLIKE THE ONE I DESCRIBED ON MY REGRESSION TAPE ... OF THE FALSE MEMORY OF MY SISTER 'S ABDUCTION . AGENT SCULLY ? I 'VE LISTENED TO THE TAPE SEVERAL TIMES , AND I DON 'T HAVE A CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT I HEAR MYSELF SAYING , BUT I ALSO DON 'T SEE ANY REASON WHY I 'D BE SAYING IT . I 'VE GOT A PROBLEM . THE PROBLEM IS I HAVE TO HEAD UP THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT . I DON 'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF INTERPRETATION . I HAVE TO MAKE A REPORT , AND THAT REPORT MUST STATE A REASON OR CITE A FACT ... OR AT LEAST MAKE AN ASSUMPTION . AS I SIT HERE RIGHT NOW , I 'M UNABLE TO DO THAT . - I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED . - IT WAS STAGED- - - TO ? - TO TEST A CLASSIFIED MILITARY PROJECT , OR TO COVER IT UP . THEN WHAT HAPPENED TO CASSANDRA SPENDER ? CASSANDRA SPENDER WAS TAKEN ABOARD A MILITARY AIRCRAFT AS PART OF THE STAGING . OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS , I 'VE DOUBTED YOU , ONLY TO BE PERSUADED BY THE POWER OF YOUR BELIEF ... IN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA . AND I 'M DOUBTING YOU NOW NOT BECAUSE OF THAT BELIEF BUT ... BECAUSE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA IS , FRANKLY , THE MORE PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION . THEN I SUGGEST YOU PUT THAT IN YOUR REPORT . THE VACCINE HAS NO EFFECT . - WE MUST GIVE IT TIME . - WE MUST SURVIVE FIRST . SURVIVAL MEANS COLLABORATION . TURN OVER THE ALIEN REBEL ... AND YOU TURN OVER ANY CHANCE OF RESISTANCE . IT 'S ALREADY BEEN DONE . I HEARD ABOUT THIS OFFICE . IT REALLY IS IN THE BASEMENT . I 'M HERE ABOUT MY MOTHER . WELL , WE , WE DON 'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE . I SPOKE WITH DR. WERBER . HE SAID YOU 'D BEEN TO HIS OFFICE . - DID HE SAY WHY ? - NO . DIDN 'T HAVE TO . I 'M ASSUMING , KNOWING THE FACTS I DO , THAT YOU 'RE WONDERING ... ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALIEN ABDUCTION . I 'M SURE YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT . AGENT MULDER SURELY PUSHED THE IDEA . NO , ACTUALLY , AGENT MULDER HASN 'T . I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE . I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE ABOUT YOUR MOTHER . YOU WENT TO SEE HER . I 'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT . WE TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS FEELING . WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS . YOU TALKED ABOUT ABDUCTION , ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES ? - DID YOU TALK ABOUT ME ? - IN WHAT WAY ? I HAVE SOMETHING HERE THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN A LOT FOR YOU . AND THERE 'S A BRIGHT LIGHT . THERE 'S PEOPLE STANDING AROUND . THAT 'S ME . I 'M ELEVEN YEARS OLD . I 'M LOOKING UP IN THE SKY WHERE THE BRIGHT LIGHT IS . I 'M STARTING TO CRY . I 'M REALLY , REALLY SCARED , AND I WANNA GET BACK IN THE CAR , BUT I CAN 'T FIND MY MOM . AND THEN I SEE HER . THERE 'S SOMETHING IN THE SKY , AND IT 'S GOT FLASHING LIGHTS ... AND IT 'S SO BRIGHT IT HURTS MY EYES . AND THEN SHE 'S GOING UP IN THE SKY , AND I 'M YELLING , " MOMMY . MOMMY , MOMMY . " AND THEN I FEEL MY FEET , AND THEY AREN 'T ON THE GROUND . I 'M FLOATING UP . - SEEN ENOUGH ? - IS THAT WHAT YOU 'RE AFRAID PEOPLE ARE GONNA FIND OUT ? YES , BUT NOT BECAUSE IT 'S TRUE . NONE OF THIS HAPPENED . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . I MADE IT UP . OR , I SHOULD SAY , MY MOM DID . - SHE TOLD YOU TO SAY THOSE THINGS ? - ESSENTIALLY . SHE TOLD ME THAT STORY SO MANY TIMES THAT I BELIEVED IT . ABSOLUTELY . IT BECAME A KIND OF TRUTH ... AND IT WAS REALLY JUST A SUBSTITUTE . - FOR WHAT ? - FOR THE FACT THAT MY DAD HAD LEFT HIS FAMILY , AND IT DROVE MY MOM INSANE . ONLY I WAS ELEVEN , AND I DIDN 'T KNOW IT . WHY ARE YOU HERE ? WHY DID YOU SHOW THIS TO ME ? BECAUSE I THINK THE PROCESS IS BOGUS . DR. WERBER AND HIS WHOLE REGRESSION OF MEMORY IS B.S. IT 'S LIKE HAVING A DREAM AND THEN PRETENDING IT 'S REAL . I THINK THAT DR. WERBER WOULD BEG TO DIFFER . HE INDULGED AND INFANTILIZED MY MOTHER FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES . I THINK HE 'S DANGEROUS , AND I THINK HIS METHODS ARE UNSOUND . IF YOU WENT THROUGH IT , I HOPE YOU 'D QUESTION WHAT CAME OUT OF IT . I APPRECIATE YOUR OPINION , AGENT SPENDER , BUT I DON 'T HAVE A MOTHER FEEDING ME ABDUCTION STORIES . YOU 'VE GOT AGENT MULDER , DON 'T YOU ? HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD THE STORIES HE 'S TOLD ? HOW ABOUT THE ONE ABOUT HIS OWN SISTER ? DON 'T LET YOURSELF BE USED . YOU MUST BE LOSING IT , MULDER . I CAN BEAT YOU WITH ONE HAND . ISN 'T THAT HOW YOU LIKE TO BEAT YOURSELF ? IF THOSE ARE MY LAST WORDS , I CAN DO BETTER . - I 'M NOT HERE TO KILL YOU , MULDER . I 'M HERE TO HELP YOU . - HEY , THANKS . IF IT WASN 'T IN MY BEST INTERESTS , I WOULD JUST AS SOON SQUEEZE THIS TRIGGER . WHAT 'S STOPPING YOU ? HEAR THIS , AGENT MULDER . LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY , BECAUSE WHAT I 'M TELLING YOU IS DEADLY SERIOUS . THERE IS A WAR RAGING , AND UNLESS YOU PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE SAND , YOU AND I AND ABOUT FIVE BILLION OTHER PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO THE WAY OF THE DINOSAUR . I 'M TALKING PLANNED INVASION- - THE COLONIZATION OF THIS PLANET BY AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL RACE . [ Laughing ] I THOUGHT YOU WERE SERIOUS . KAZAKHSTAN , SKYLAND MOUNTAIN , THE SITE IN PENNSYLVANIA , THEY 'RE ALL ALIEN LIGHTHOUSES WHERE THE COLONIZATION WILL BEGIN , BUT WHERE NOW A BATTLE 'S BEING WAGED- - A STRUGGLE FOR HEAVEN AND EARTH WHERE THERE IS ONE LAW : FIGHT OR DIE . AND ONE RULE : RESIST OR SERVE . - SERVE WHO ? - NO , NOT WHO . WHAT . KRYCEK , YOU 'RE A MURDERER , A LIAR AND A COWARD . JUST BECAUSE YOU STICK A GUN IN MY CHEST , I 'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE YOU 'RE MY FRIEND ? GET UP . I WAS SENT BY A MAN , A MAN WHO KNOWS , AS I DO , THAT RESISTANCE IS IN OUR GRASP ... AND IN YOURS . THE MASS INCINERATIONS WERE STRIKES BY AN ALIEN REBELLION ... TO UPSET PLANS FOR OCCUPATION . ONE OF THESE REBELS IS BEING HELD CAPTIVE . AND IF HE DIES , SO DOES THE RESISTANCE . [ Speaking Russian ] [ Door Opening , Slamming ] [ Knocking ] COME IN . MULDER ? HUH . WHAT ARE YOU DOING SITTING HERE IN THE DARK ? THINKING . THINKING ABOUT WHAT ? WELL , THE USUAL . DESTINY , FATE , HOW TO THROW A CURVEBALL . THE INEXTRICABLE RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR LIVES ... THAT ARE NEITHER ACCIDENTAL NOR ... SOMEHOW IN OUR CONTROL EITHER . I 'VE JUST TAKEN A LONG WALK , AND I 'VE RECONSIDERED ... THAT I MAY HAVE BEEN WRONG ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVED HAPPENED TO ME . I 'VE BEEN DOING SOME RECONSIDERING OF MY OWN . - WHAT IS THIS ? - MAYBE AN ANSWER ... TO A QUESTION YOU AND I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DESTINED TO ASK . YES , SIR ? WE 'RE FEDERAL AGENTS REQUESTING PERMISSION TO ENTER THE BASE . DO YOU HAVE ANY PAPERWORK TO GO WITH THAT , AGENT " MULDAR " ? IT 'S MULDER . I WASN 'T AWARE THAT ANY SPECIAL AUTHORIZATION WAS NEEDED TO ENTER . DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR FACILITY AND THE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS ON SITE , I CAN ONLY ALLOW PRECLEARED CIVILIAN AND MILITARY PERSONNEL ON BASE . ARE YOU AWARE THAT THERE 'S BEEN A LEAK AND CONTAMINATION ... IN ONE OF THE LAB FACILITIES AND THAT THE PERSONNEL INSIDE NEED IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION ? - NO , SIR , I WASN 'T . - WHY DON 'T YOU CHECK ON THAT , SON ? I 'D HATE FOR SOMEBODY TO DIE BECAUSE YOU WERE UNINFORMED . BUCKLE UP , SCULLY . MULDER , HE 'S ARMED AND WELL WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION . - I KNOW THIS MAN . - WHO ? THAT DRIVER . I KNOW HIS FACE . YES , SIR . [ Man On Phone ] THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO BE HERE . - PLACE THEM UNDER ARREST IMMEDIATELY ! - YES , SIR . STOP THAT TRUCK ! GET OUT OF THE CAR . YOU 'RE UNDER ARREST . THIS IS WEST GATE . I 'VE GOT A BREACH OF SECURITY ... AND A POSSIBLE HIJACKING OF A MILITARY VEHICLE . [ Brakes Squeaking ] [ Engine Stopping ] [ Low Rumbling ] [ Rumbling Grows Louder ] NO-O-O ! [ Gunshot ] WHAT HAPPENED ? I DON 'T KNOW . AGENT SPENDER . SIR . I 'M SORRY . THERE 'S BEEN NO NEWS ABOUT YOUR MOTHER . I APPRECIATE YOU WANTING TO KEEP THIS DISCREET . I 'LL TRY AND DO THAT . BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW AGENT MULDER HAS OPENED AN X-FILE ON THIS CASE . THIS HASN 'T REFLECTED ON YOU IN ANY WAY , AGENT SPENDER . - THANK YOU , SIR . - YOU 'LL DO FINE . IT SEEMS YOU HAVE A PATRON OUTSIDE THIS OFFICE WHO THINKS HIGHLY OF YOU . - WHO 'S THAT ? - I DON 'T KNOW . SOMEONE WORKING WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF INFLUENCE . OH , AGENT SPENDER . GOT A LETTER FOR YOU . SORRY ABOUT THAT , MISTER . [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

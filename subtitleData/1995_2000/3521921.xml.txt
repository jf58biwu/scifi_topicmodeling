 [ Beeping ] What are we doing , Sydney ? An experiment about sexuality . - Reproduction ? - That 's one aspect of it . I read the biology manuals . Reading isn 't quite the same as feeling . I 'd like you to meet someone , Jarod . [ Beeping Increases ] - You 're a girl . - [ Woman On TV ] Will you marry me ? - Never . No ! Oh ! - [ People Laughing ] [ Woman ] Now will you marry me ? They seem to be able to withstand an amazing amount of pain . People find this type of violence funny ? - Not people , men . - [ Men Laughing ] - [ Man On TV ] You moron . ! - Why is that ? Nobody knows . The Stooges have been one of ... the great mysteries between the sexes . - [ Man On TV ] Ow . ! - [ Laughing ] - I think I see it . - [ Jarod Laughing ] - [ Man On TV ] My piano . ! - No , not you too . I 'm sorry , but , really , it is pretty funny . [ Laughing ] Oh . Oh . I 'm sorry . I feel like such a ... Stooge ? [ Men Laughing ] Hey , mattress brain , the bill 's 12.95 . Oh . Oh . These guys have caused enough distractions for one day . [ Men Laughing ] Park Service Rangers from all over have joined in the search ... for Victor Simpkins , an ornithology grad student ... who vanished in our local mountains . I spoke with Simpkins 's mother moments ago . When I didn 't hear from Victor , well ... I just thought he was late , but now it 's been five days . I 'm just praying he 's okay . With a storm heading this way , rangers are anxious to find Simpkins before it 's too late . Live from the Toluca National Forest , this is David Milkson , Action 15 . - Okay , here 's your ... - [ Man # 2 On TV ] Thank you , David . In other local news ... I need one more body to help sector out Scovell Ridge , B-1 through B-7 . Steep approach , bad underbrush , a lot of slippery shale . - Who wants to hump that ? - I 'm your man . [ Man Narrating ] - You got experience ? - I spent a few years ... in the Army Rangers . - I specialized in high mountain work . - Man , you were made to order . - You could say that . - What 's your name ? Jarod ... Forest . All right , people , listen up . Advance parties went up at dawn . We move out in 30 minutes . This kid 's been missing for five days , and his mother 's very concerned . He ... We are running out of time , so we leave no stones unturned . We 're looking for a needle , folks , and we haven 't even found the haystack . - Forest . Derek Kobey . - Nice to meet you . So , had anyone seen Victor Simpkins before he was reported missing ? No one was looking for him . Of course , for the last few days ... the boss had me doing paperwork while he got to do all the fun stuff . - Fun stuff ? - Stan 's been on the north side ... of the mountain clearing trails , setting charges . Lots of deep ravines , caves , fallen old growth . You take a tumble in that , I don 't care if you 're Moby Dick , we might not find you . It sounds like you know the terrain pretty well . Eight years . I came out here on one of those ... " Let 's expose the urban youth to the great outdoors " programs . - [ Man ] Hey , Derek . - Funny thing is , it worked . - Phone . - I love the Bronx , but this is home now . So , Forest , where did you do your mountain training ? - In the mountains , mostly . - Yeah . No , seriously , where were you stationed ? Fort Lewis ? - You were in the army too ? - Fifteen years . You ever come across a Sergeant Tripcheck , a Ranger instructor at Benning ? - Sounds familiar . - He 's lying , Stan . He 's really one of the Stooges . - You two know each other ? - We ran into each other once . - Is she a ranger ? - No . She 's a volunteer . She runs a little outfitting place a few miles down the road . I wouldn 't get any ideas . She keeps mostly to herself . Stan , just got word from the advance team . - They found Simpkins 's base camp . - [ Radio Chatter ] We 'll split into teams of two and fan across the mountain . I want everyone to report in at 30-minute intervals . - [ Man On Radio ] Standing by for an update . - I need flares over here . Where 's Forest ? Disturbance in the Force ? - Uh , the Force ? - Obi-Wan Kenobi ? Star Wars ? - The satellite missile defense system ? - What are you doing ? I 'm just trying to imagine what kind of person Victor is ... and who would want to spend months in isolation on purpose . Somebody who 's trying to find himself ? In the middle of the wilderness ? Sometimes you have to get lost before you can find yourself . [ Man ] One more man for the team . Mrs. Simpkins ? Hi , I 'm Jarod Forest . I was wondering if I might ask you some questions about your son . Anything to help . - Is Victor right-handed or left-handed ? - He 's right-handed . I noticed that he had many books on predatory birds . He 's been out here for months documenting the nesting patterns of eagles . He 's loved them since he was a little boy . He used to sit out in front of his tent and watch them all day . He 's the only family I have . Don 't worry . We 'll find him . - We won 't leave the mountain until we do . - This way , Mrs. Simpkins . - So who am I paired with , Stan ? - Moe . - You look confused . - I am confused . Victor had been out here for months ... yet there was no sign of a refuse pile or a latrine ? - Meaning ? - I don 't know . - Just another piece of the puzzle . - You 're a strange Stooge , Moe . What about that left-hand , right-hand stuff ? Victor 's eyeglasses were on the left-hand side ofhis sleeping bag . Seems kind of awkward for a right-handed man . This way . Jarod ? Somebody 's covered their tracks by brushing over them . They head up that way . Aah ! Aah ! - I didn 't mean to startle you . - That 's okay . I 'll live . About two weeks less , but I 'll live . Hi . I 'm Jarod , and this is Nia . Bob . Sorry , Jarod . You startled me . Can 't shake the hand of a man who just startled me . I have to wait till the next time I see you . - Are you hiding from someone , Bob ? - Hiding ? I 'm looking . Oh . Oh , you 're with the search party . Search party ? They got a search party to find Bob ? - I thought you were Bob . - I am Bob , Big Bob . Looking for Little Bob . He 's my partner . Oh , uh ... - We 're looking for a student . - His camp was about three miles west . - Brown hair , about 5 ' 11 " . - Don 't know him . Don 't know his camp . I ain 't seen nothing . Should we alert someone about Little Bob ? No , you don 't want to get my partner mad . I 've seen him go into a bar and tear it up from one end to the other . - How will we know him if we find him ? - You don 't want to find him . He don 't like strangers . Truth be told , he don 't like anybody . [ Sniffing ] Bad storm coming . Bad one . - [ Chuckles ] - [ Thunder Rumbling ] And before the Rangers ? Test pilot , thoracic surgeon , lieutenant commander on a destroyer . The usual . What did you do before you became an outfitter ? Astronaut , Olympic skater , Nobel Prize winner . The usual . [ Nia ] What 's that over there ? It 's a carabineer . I 'm going to get it . No climber would leave that behind . Be careful . You don 't know these cliffs . It 's dangerous . Relax . I was a Sherpa on Mount Everest once . Really . Be careful . These markings are fresh . Looks like it 's only a few days old . Jarod ! [ Shouts ] Come on . Ow ! That 's Victor 's mark . Orange tape . The Inuit sign for eagle . He said anybody could use their initials . He 's an experienced climber . He wouldn 't leave his equipment behind unless ... Listen , the sun rises at 6 : 35 . We deploy here from K-4 to K-8 , just below the cliff . I want everyone here at quarter of 6 : 00 . There 's a cold front moving through in the next 48 hours . Will my son be able to survive ? Your son is an experienced climber . He may be cold and he may be hungry , but people have survived worse . I know he 's out there somewhere , worrying about you too . Everybody , get some sleep . We head out at the crack of dawn . - Hey , Kobey , where 's the nearest motel ? - About 100 miles . And when you get there , you 'll wish it was another 100 . I 've got a spare room . Grab your gear . I 'll wait for you outside . Man , that must 've been some search up there today . Hmm ? Senorita Iceberg invites you over for a slumber party ? - You are in . - In where ? Couch is old , and except for a spring or two in your back ... it 's comfortable . I 'm sure it will be fine . The Casa Rosada . You 're Argentinean . Is this you with your parents ? Not too many gringos know about the Argentinean White House . I 'm impressed . - Is that everything ? - I travel light . - On the run ? - Some days . I do a lot of consulting work . Take off your shirt . Why didn 't you say it was so bad ? I guess I didn 't realize it . I 'll try to leave some hot water for you . Okay ? [ Beeping ] You 're a girl . My name is Jarod . What 's your name ? Miss Parker . Shower 's all yours . Sleep well . You too . [ Phone Ringing ] - This is Sydney . - [ Jarod ] It 's me . I need to talk to you ... about women . - Why is that ? - Because I met one . [ Nia ] No . ! [ Shouting In Spanish ] [ Spanish ] [ Shouting Continues ] It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's all right . It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're safe . [ Jarod ] It 's me . I need to talk to you ... about women . [ Sydney ] Why is that ? - Because I met one . - Tell me more . I 've been around hundreds of women since I left ... but I never experienced with them what I feel with the one I 'vejust met . - Tell me about your feelings . - I have a hard time focusing when I 'm near her . And if we happen to touch , my heart rate ... my blood pressure , even my breathing becomes erratic . Frankenboy has a girlfriend . - [ Sydney ] It 's chemical , Jarod . - Chemical ? The feelings you 're having ... they 're driven by your body 's response to an external stimulus . - In this case , a woman . - Tonight , when she came out of the shower ... - [ Broots ] There . - What are you doing ? That 's where the radio in the background is clearest . A little presto-chango , and maybe we can filter it out and figure out the song . I didn 't hear any radio . I would like to hear the rest of the tape . Maybe there 's a clue you might have missed . [ Clears Throat ] [ Stan ] Now if Victor Simpkins went down here ... he had to go through an area between this cliff face and the river . Anybody find anything , we 're on channel nine . All right . Let 's move out , quickly . We found Simpkins 's carabineer here , right ? Yes . Why ? The Force still with you ? Why cross a cliff that dangerous when you can hike around it ? Maybe he just got the urge . People don 't always plan things . No , I guess they don 't . Thanks for being there last night . What did you mean when you said , " I don 't want to disappear " ? - I said that ? - Twice . - In Spanish . - You must 've misunderstood me . Hablo espanol muy bien . [ Clears Throat ] I said , " Here 's the tape copy you wanted . ' " OfJarod 's conversation . Are you still here ? Uh , no . [ Young Miss Parker ] You 're afraid of me , aren 't you ? - No . - You were yesterday . - I could tell . - I was nervous . - You have soft skin . - You didn 't even touch me . Yes , I did . In here . Hold out your hand like this . Can you feel it ? What 's your name ? Your first name ? [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Jarod ] So let me get this straight . They were called " The Three Stooges , ' " but there were actually four . With Shemp . Five if you countJoe Besser . Though a lot of people don 't . And six if you include Curly-Joe DeRita . But he wasn 't even funny in Spanish . [ Laughs ] [ Jarod Laughs ] - Was Larry one of the brothers ? - No . - Moe , Curly and ... - [ Twig Snaps ] - What ? - I thought I heard something . [ Shouting ] - Are you okay ? - [ Groaning ] Sorry . I can 't shake your hand just yet . This is the second time you 've seen me . Except you just walked between two pine trees . Ain 't never gonna happen . - Did you find your partner ? - No . I gotta keep checking on my crop , even without him . - Checking on your crop ? - Yeah . - Now I gotta do Little Bob 's job too . - Is he sick ? Nerves . Had the shakes ever since that plane buzzed him last Friday . And then the dynamite . [ Laughs ] That just about put him over the top . Someone was setting off dynamite out here ? Yeah , Ranger Conrad was clearing the trail of some old stumps . - [ Man ] Sector 4 , come in . - Forest here . I found Victor Simpkins 's pack about a quarter of a mile downstream ... from the cliff , lodged in some debris along the riverbank . Simpkins 's tracks led right to the water . I 'm guessing he got hurt in the fall from the cliff ... made it to the water , passed out or slipped and fell in . If he didn 't drown , he 's somewhere downriver ... - or in the Pacific . - [ Mrs. Simpkins ] Oh , my God . ! - Are you calling off the search for my son ? - No , ma 'am . I 'm shifting personnel and oversight to the Anawalt County Sheriff 's Department ... who 's got direct supervision of the river from here to the coast . Now , listen , I called Sheriff Hansen . He 's a good man . He 'll do whatever he can to help find Victor . Come with me , Mrs. Simpkins . He 's got enough gear and food to climb for days . He was documenting the nesting patterns of eagles . There 's nothing here to write on . It doesn 't make sense . His camp , his carabineer , this ... this backpack . [ Nia ] But what does it mean ? Someone wants the search for Victor to go downstream . You 're not going , are you ? No . He 's still on this mountain . Can anybody hear me ? [ Coughing ] [ Shower Running ] [ Young Sydney ] Jarod , Apollo 1 simulation . The first warning is a flash as the spark ignites the pure oxygen in the capsule . I try to flee , but I can 't . I 'm strapped in . I know the escape procedure , but the fire , it 's too hot . It comes into my air lines . I try not to breathe , but it 's too late . I can 't open the hatch . I can 't open the hatch ! It 's too hot ! I can 't think ! No one can get to us ! We can 't be saved ! I 'm burning ! I 'm burning ! Jarod ! I 'm here . It 's all right . No one could save them . It was impossible . I tried not to use all the hot water . [ Closes Briefcase ] Is that boy you ? - I know it 's crazy , but I can explain . - Shh . We all have scars . - [ Sydney ] How much longer , Broots ? - Hard to say . At first , I thought the song from Jarod 's phone call ... was " I Shot the Sheriff , " but then I refiltered it ... - and realized it was " Bungle in theJungle . " - Mm-hmm . How much longer , Broots ? Well , between BMI 's and ASCAP 's computer base of playlists ... it could be some time . But then as soon as we get a hit , and we find the station ... I 've programmed the computer to call here . Then ... [ Clears Throat ] we 're in business . - We 're in business . - Yeah . How much longer ? Wake up . I think I 've got it . We 've been climbing for nine hours . - You want to tell me what we 're looking for ? - That . This was Victor 's camp . The Force is with you . How did you know ? Something always bothered me about Simpkins 's base camp . The camp was way too low on the mountain to observe ... the nesting patterns of eagles , because they always nest at the highest point . - What the hell is that ? - The plane that scared Little Bob . The pilot 's dead . There was a bullet in his head . - Oh , my God . - I found traces of narcotics in the back . - And I found this . - Deliver your drugs , pick up your money . You don 't file a flight plan with a run like this , so if your plane crashes ... - No one looks for you . - Somebody was up here . There 's two sets of footprints , but they both come from different directions . Then one chases the other ... that way . He heard the crash , came down here . He just wanted to help . He saw the murder . He 's running . He 's running for his life . Victor Simpkins . And who was chasing him ? Who was blowing up stumps when Bob heard the plane ? - Conrad . - Conrad is leading the search . - What were you ... How did you ... - Trust in the Force , young Jedi . I saw your laser disk last night . Those prints head down to Box Canyon . We 'll start that way tomorrow . I hope Victor Simpkins is under some kind of cover tonight . Because if he 's not , he 's not going to make it . Neither are we , unless we find some shelter . I know a place . - Why didn 't you tell me ? - What ? - Shut up ! - Let him alone . - [ Moe ] You too . Come here . - [ Larry , Shemp Groaning ] - [ Larry , Shemp ] Mmmm . - There . - [ Larry , Shemp Groaning ] - Morons . [ Jarod ] I need to talk to you ... about women . [ Rewinding ] - About women . - [ Rewinding ] About women . You know , girls mature faster than boys . [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunderclap ] Nothing like a home-cooked meal . So I 'm told . When I was a child ... I was taken ... at least I think I was taken ... by these people who raised me . They made me do things ... things that hurt other ... - You don 't have to tell me anything . - I know . I never told anybody before , but I want to tell you . I don 't know who I am . You 'reJarod , and you 're here with me . [ Chuckles ] - How old were you when you left Argentina ? - Thirteen . Was it because of the Guerra Sucia ? I saw the scars on your back . I was eight . They came and took us for no reason at all . My father published a newspaper . My mother met him when she was a reporter . But she hadn 't worked for years . She was too busy raising me . They woke us up in the middle of the night . I could hear my mother screaming , cursing at them . I never heard her swear like that before . They took us to this place ... this horrible place . I never saw them again . They beat me . They ... They ... [ Whispering ] I 'm sorry . They wanted me to lie about my parents ... that they hated the generals , had plotted against them . I wouldn 't lie . Finally , they let me go . They put me with some family ... but no one will talk to me about my parents . They had disappeared . Then the generals left , and I came here . I don 't know if my parents are dead or alive . I don 't know either . I miss them very much . - [ Sobbing ] - I know , I know . I know , I know , I know . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shh . I know this is going to sound crazy . - I 've never ... - Shh . I just want to know who I am . I can stand anything for that . [ Rustling ] [ Rustling Continues ] [ Snorting ] [ Pats ] [ Snorting Continues ] [ Jarod ] Is that pig wearing a baseball cap ? There you are . Look at him . All the stress made him lose weight . Sooey , sooey , sooey , sooey . ! Come here you , boy . - [ Jarod ] Is that your pig ? - Pig ? He 's no pig . He 's my partner in a burgeoning mushroom empire . - Little Bob . - Little Bob . - The one and only . - And your crop would be truffles ? The finest damn nose in these United States . Found a mother lode too . We could 've been rich , till someone went and blowed up ... the old mine shaft where he discovered over a ton of them . - Mine shaft ? - Yeah , the one down in Box Canyon . Blowed it the same day that plane flew over . Come here , big boy . Come on . Footprints . Two sets . [ Jarod ] Two go in , but only one comes out . Conrad chased Victor , trying to silence him . Victor ran in here to hide . Conrad , running short of time , decided to blow out the entrance , sealing him in . The Force is with me . [ Chuckles ] Victor ! Victor ! - [ Nia ] Victor . ! - Victor ! - Victor ! - Victor ! - [ Gasping ] - Victor . - [ Nia ] Victor . - Victor . [ Coughing ] It 's okay . You 're going to be okay . [ Keyboarding ] [ Beeping ] [ Imitating Three Stooges , Gibberish ] - [ Clang ] - [ Horn Honks ] [ Instrumental ] [ Theme From The Three Stooges ] [ Shuts Off ] - [ Sydney ] Miss Parker ? - What ? We 've traced the song to a small radio station in north-central Oregon . - [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Radio Chatter ] Toluca National Forest , Ranger Conrad speaking . [ Big Bob ] Uh , yeah , this is Bob Carsey . Ranger Conrad , I think I found the Simpkins kid . Where is he ? Is he alive ? I couldn 't tell . He was trapped behind a rockfall ... inside the old copper mine in Box Canyon . I could barely make a hole big enough to look in and see . I 'm on my way . Kobey , I need you here to coordinate the men and the equipment coming up . - Do you want me to call his mother ? - No . Not till we 're sure we have good news . [ Clanking ] Hey , Simpkins . Simpkins . Hey , Simpkins . Well , it 's about time . My legs were starting to cramp up . Kind oflike Lazarus , huh , Conrad ? So , uh , is Simpkins okay ? You mean is he alive , so he can testify against you ? - You betcha . - So , why didn 't you just call the police ? You 're after what 's in the plane . - Hey , there 's a lot more where that came from . - No deal . [ Booming ] [ Jarod ] Kind of spooky in here , isn 't it ? Do you think this is what hell is like , Stan ? Imagine what it 's like to be trapped in here ... and no one can hear you screaming . There 's only one way out ! Hey , Conrad , I 'd stand back if I were you . No ! Jarod ! Don 't leave me here , Jarod ! Please ! Oh , don 't worry . I 'll lead the search for you personally ... in a few days . Jarod ! Jarod ! I know how to do many things ... but I don 't know how to do this . I know you have to go . People are looking for me . If I stay , you 'd be in danger . You may already be . I know how to take care of myself . I hope you find what you 're looking for . You 've already helped me find a part of it . Adiós , mi vida . [ Theme From The Three Stooges ] [ Car Doors Opening , Closing ] - Have you seen this man ? - Yes . He was tall , handsome , a little mole on his right eye . - Yes ? - He stayed for a few nights . - He 's gone now . - Did he say where he was going ? No , but he did mention something about loving Argentina . Do you think he 'll come back ? I hope so . [ Car Engine Starts ] [ Mews ]

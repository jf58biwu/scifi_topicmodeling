 I 'm done . I think we 've tracked this stream as far as it goes . One of these will lead to a larger river . And a way off the plateau , but not this one and not the three before . Shhh ! Oh what now ? Charming , anyone you know ? Vantus . Headhunters , I thought we 'd left their territory . Perhaps they 're extending their real estate holdings . Get down . Vantus , too many of them . I think we should be somewhere else . Right . Careful Roxton ... soup of the day hot lead . There we go . Well these should see us through another few weeks . You should have been an artist Summerlee . For one brief glorious moment , I was . Really what happened ? Parents , friends ... I allowed them to convince me ... that I wasn 't brave enough for the adventure . An artist 's life was filled with dangers and insecurities ... science was safe . And here we are . This way . They 're right behind us . Stay here . What is this place ? This looks like it used to be a mine . Spanish from the looks of those support work ... probably conquistadors looking for gold . Gold ? It must be three , four hundred years old . I need more light . - This looks like . - It is , it 's incredible . All of it . The mother lode ... gold . All clear . Let 's get out of here . - What the hell 's happening ? - Run ! Earthquake ! Malone , Challenger ! can you hear me ? Marguerite ! Hello ? Are you alright ? At the dawn of the century A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible ... The existence of a prehistoric world . The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations ... and terrifying creatures . Always searching for a way home ... A way out of ... the Lost World Are you alright ? Where 's Marguerite ? Somebody get this off me . Are you in one piece ? Just barely , what happened ? Earthquake . Let me guess we 're trapped . How much air ? From the looks and the size of our prison . I 'd say six or seven hours and that 's without the torch . Great ! Maybe five with the torch . Challenger ? It has to be unanimous . I never did like the dark very much . Roxton ! Summerlee ! Hitting that spearheaded ... was the finest example of marksmanship and I have ever witnessed . I was aiming right between his eyes . We 've got trouble . I hate rocks . It 's no good we should stop . What do you mean stop ? It 's the least a thousand cubic yards of rock and dirt ... between us and the entrance . So ? We can 't move it all . We can damn well try . Marguerite the harder you work ... the more oxygen we use . You can do what you want . Veronica will bring the others . If she 's not crushed by ten ton of rock ... if the Vantu 's don 't get her . If ... You find this amusing ? Sorry . No , no , no ... I 'd like to find out what 's so humorous ... about suffocating in the dark . Gladys . I beg your pardon . It 's the reason I 'm here , my publishers daughter . I asked her to marry me ... and she said I wasn 't a big enough adventurer for her . Her man would have to blaze trails , leave a mark . The only mark I 'm going to leave is a pile of bones ... in this god forsaken tomb . Nobody 's dying in here Malone . Now get off your ass and help me with this . He 's right Marguerite ... Challenger 's right . Not by me he isn 't . Then you will work harder ... and die sooner , we all will . Rest ... rest . Is something wrong ? No , I 'm fine . I just think it would be better if I stayed here . - At the treehouse ? - Alone ? Waiting for the Vantu 's too return ? Logically I 'd just slow you down . Logically you 'd be lunch Professor ... grab your pack . I think not . Professor , please . Please , don 't ask me again Veronica ... I 'm not brave enough to decline twice . I 'm asking you , we 're all in this together Summerlee . Did you say something ? I 'm sorry . Really ? Sorry that we 're all gonna die in here ... or sorry that you lost your chance of glory ? That 's enough . No she 's right . It was my vanity that brought us here . My quest for a scientific triumph ... that 's killed us . It 's a little late for Mea Culpa Challenger ... Challenger , Challenger ? - Let 's stop here . - No ! We 're losing light . We 've got to continue . Good lord look ! Well we don 't want to run into this fellow in the dark ... we 'll make camp continue at dawn . They mustn 't die because of me . Don 't flatter yourself Summerlee , stumbling through the jungle at night is an easy way to get killed . And we won 't be saving anyone if we 're dead . First thing we need to do is build a fire . No not that , it will smoke too much . We don 't want to advertise our location . Of course . Let 's get back to the fire . Roxton . I fell asleep . That 's okay . it 's good to know you 're human after all . I 'll keep watch . Two hours no more . Still here . I 'm not sorry for anything . God ? Heaven . I 'm not so sure . Challenger . Hey , take it easy lad . Slowly , breathe slowly . Where are we ? Oh , my god . Trespassers . There was an earthquake . We were trapped , dying . How many more wait on the outside ? Our friends will come to look for us if ... that 's what you 're talking about . We mean you no harm . In fact we thank you ... all of you , for saving our lives . Your lives are not yet your own . It 's gonna be one of those days . Surely madam there 's been some misunderstanding . No ... our history is quite clear . You are outsiders ... and outsiders bring death . We 've got company . Vantu ? Not that lucky . Raptors . Two maybe three . - Eh ? What ? - Shhhh . Talk about your rude awakening . So far so good . Yes , but let 's not tempt providence , shall we ? Time to move . This is incredible . These people living underground for over three hundred years . The fortune in gold and silver all around them . They don 't seem to care about that . No accounting for taste . I wonder what would take to mine all this . Getting out of here alive . Point taken . Let 's just hope Challenger 's a smooth talker . How can I convince you that we 're not a threat ? That 's what they said at first . They ? The conquistadores ... this is what they were after . Gold and silver . Blood ... the blood of my ancestors . The invaders made us slaves of their greed ... forced my people to dig these mines . And used the profits to finance their expedition . But the earth would not be robbed ... and the rock does not forget . It struck back . How ? With sickness and death . Their bodies became covered in blisters ... twisting in fevered agony . Smallpox . Some of my people manage to escape deep within these caves . Soon all the rest were dead . And you 've lived underground ever since ? This is the way we stay safe . No one ever leaves . You 're making it hard to concentrate . The possibility of an imminent death always makes me restless . What the hell is keeping Challenger ? Well it 's about time . Please keep your distance . I beg your pardon ? You 're outsiders you carry disease . Flattery will get you nowhere . What have we here ? There 's nothing like a lovely Margot ... rich full bouquet . It 's only water . Then why is it red ? Take a look . - Grab his sword . - Well done . Now , our friend 's going to show us the way out of here . In all the year 's ... why has no one here wanted to explore beyond the caves ? Our bodies have adapted to this environment . The healing springs sustains us . Without it we would wither and die ... blinded by the harsh glare of your world . Garza ... my world is not so harsh as you imagine . My friends and I have no interest in your precious metals . Your secret will be our secret . You have saved our lives once ... you can do it again . What is this ? Come on Challenger we 're getting out of here . You damn fools . We thought you 'd be glad to see us . Where do you think you 're going ? As far away from here as possible . The rock knows your treachery it will not allow you to escape . Whatever you say . Now ! The rock knows . We 'll stop here . I 'll scout ahead . I 'll stay here with him . I did suggest I 'd might be a burden . We only have a few minutes of light left . I could 've sworn we 've been this way before . Nobody ever listens to me . Take the left tunnel I said , but no what did you two do . Okay okay you were right are you happy now ? It looks like it 's time for another decision . Apparently you 're the expert . The right one . Don 't bother to run ... there is no escape . You certainly picked a fine time to start listening to me . The rock has returned you to us . Garza please listen ... we have no designs on your riches . Your fate is not up to me . Who then ? One much wiser than I ... The Oracle . The Oracle ? that 's a person ? The shining light of truth and wisdom . He will determine your fate . Cannibals . Hey , my one consolation is that these tough old bones ... will probably give them indigestion . We 're not cooked yet Professor . Have you got any bright ideas , now 's the time to share them . Well at least they didn 't kill us outright . Carry us on their backs all the way home ... they might be wild Professor but they 're not stupid . What does it matter ? they must all be dead by now . That 's right , Professor ... show them how the pipe works . I 'm terribly sorry but I 'm afraid I 'm out of tobacco . I 'm not . But that 's ... Gunpowder . There you go my friend . You pack as much in there as you can . Approach the throne and kneel . Will you tell world about us ? Sell our survival for the gold and precious stones embedded in these cave walls ? No on my word I will not . He speaks the truth . He will not betray us . You will answer the same question . I will not betray your people . This one is noble a better man then he knows he is ... he speaks the truth . Answer the question woman . Two down one to go . I will not betray you . This one . What 's the matter ? This one lies . She will betray us . - Why you little pipsqueak . - Silence . The Oracle has spoken ... you must all die . Yes that 's it . More ... you need more . Roxton . Thank you , Summerlee . Good enjoy the flavor . Let him go ! If he gets back to his village he 'll will be back with reinforcements . There 's no time . If the others aren 't dead yet , they soon will be . Who are you going to believe me or that twelve year old troll ? Thanks for nothing . Do you hear that ? Listen . Excuse me , we have just been sentenced to death . Did you feel that ? No . That one I felt . Another earthquake ? Have you lost your mind ? I hope so . What the hell are you doing ? Feel that . - Warm . - And that ? Hot . Am I missing something ? Live volcano . You can 't be serious . I 'm afraid so and we 're sitting right on top of it . It is time . Wait I must talk to Garza . Oh you will , she is your executioner . Men say strange things when they are faced with death . It 's just not my life or the lives of my friends . Your whole world is in danger . Let me talk to The Oracle and if he is truly as wise as you say than he will confirm my warning . Time is running out for all of us . You 've heard his claims Oracle . How much time before this happens ? I don 't know hours minutes I can 't be certain . Never ? It 's possible , but remote . Approach and kneel . What is it ? He lies . No ! He wants to destroy us all . I 'm telling the truth . The execution will take place as planned . Why are you doing this ? You know it 's true . Come with me ! I am not lying , this is death for all of us ... That 's it ... my last charge . I believe I 'm just about done here as well . Just enough left for the fuse line . Let 's do it . I assume you know what you 're doing ? My father once had a saying Professor ... never assume anything . You mean you never ? Blown up a hillside , first time for everything . But my dear boy the whole hillside could collapse , we could be killing them . Let 's hope there 's still something to be worried about . Look even the stream is heating up ... it 's boiling . I 'm right , I know I am . Garza you don 't have to do this . The poison mushrooms are quick there will be no pain . How comforting . You 're murdering us on the word of a child . He is The Oracle . He is a boy . Now look at me . Do you believe I lied to you ? Take the mushrooms . Feel the walls around us , the steam rising , fish dying . All the signs are here . Why would The Oracle lie to us ? Maybe he 's afraid . Yes of course . If you left these caves you wouldn 't be The Oracle any longer just a blind child in a world of light . Is this true ? Oracle is this true ? Another earthquake . Maybe it will shake some of the rocks lose . With our luck I don 't think so . Find some cover . Let 's hope this works . Professor the fuse ! We must get everyone out of here now . The entrance is blocked by the cave in there is no way out . Maybe we can dig through it . There 's no time . It 's our only chance , gather your people together . No , The Oracle was right , we 'd never survive in the outside . Well you 're certainly not going to survive here . Their lives Challenger , their choice . Not mine however , now show us the way out of here . This way . Well I guess we did it ... for better or for worse . - Daylight . - Come on . Garza come with us . The rock will protect us . Challenger hurry up . Any chance of a hand over here ? I should have known it would take more than a few rocks to kill you off . Bite your tongue . It 's the volcano it 's gonna blow . Quickly everyone . My god you did it . Did What ? The explosions redirected the lava flow away from the entrance to the cave . They 're safe , Garza ... they 're all safe . And that 's when you and the dynamite came in . You know Challenger oxygen deprivation ... can do strange things to the brain . I beg your pardon ? Impair your faculties induce all sorts of hallucinations . Are you suggesting I dreamt it ? That we all dreamt it . Listen to how it sounds ... an underground culture of the cave dwellers singing Gregorian chants . Walls streaked with silver and gold ... a blind boy who can read minds . I mean really . You were trapped for a long time . That 's right completely isolated from everyone and everything . Know what Challenger , come to think of it ... they may be right . I guess it does sound pretty unbelievable . Very well then ... a dream it is . *

There 's her friend . I know him . I don 't think he hung around with crooks . I don 't think she knew anything about it .

Why ? Why ? Why did you have to kill yourself ? Hi . Where 've you been ? Can you leave your mobile on when you 're having a drink ? We 've got to talk about that screening tomorrow . What ?

Don 't tell him where we hang out . It 's alright ... with this jerk . Is he trembling ? Don 't try anything or you 'll be up to your neck in shit . I 'm up to my neck in it already . You can 't make it worse . Waddayasay , Chisato ? Kiriko ... Where did the gun come from ? Where did you get it ? What 's the big joke ? The clients looked very impressed .

If there 's a problem , I 'm your man . Don 't breathe a word of this to the syndicate . OK ? How 's your son these days ? He 's doing great . When you were that age , you were a bit of a slugger ... Isn 't that right ? Back then ? My memory doesn 't stretch that far . You don 't say ? I 'm betting this boy 's father could kick some ass , at his age . That was when I was much younger . The time was right after the second world war . You didn 't need to practice ' cause fighting was what you did . That 's all in the past . - You want to see my son ? - Yes . Come on in . Shigeo , some friends . Hi . Please accept this . When you rob somebody , make sure he 's a weakling . Thanks for helping us out then . A Chief 's Special ? No , no , I don 't . But I got speed and I got grass . - What 's speed ? - Drugs . You mean methedrine ? Oh ... are you still in here working ? Ringo Kid : Dismantle gun . Wrap in tin foil to pass customs ! John Wayne : lmport in parts , then reassemble gun . A Better Tomorrow : Make a real gun out of a toy . Illegally ? Can give you a receipt . For a toy ? Don 't start making trouble . This size you want it , right ? Yeah , exactly the size of a pencil . And this , to match , using this ... - Okay . - I want to use it for a long time . I need it to be really strong . Please . Hey , this time we really scored . Use it for happy times , man . You 're going to be seeing stars . Is it the real thing , this , Goto ? Alright , bitch . Working here is sweated labor . This is no paradise , but if you forget about what might have been , you 'll get to like it . This time you brought the dough , daddy ? Where 've they gone ? Where 've they gone ? I 'll tear their heads off ! What 's happening ? Hey , that really hurts , asshole ! You suits make me wanna barf ! I don 't want any aggravation at my club . What 's with this guy ? He 's not part of this . Go jerk off somewhere else ! - He put the frighteners on you ? - No way . Really ? Good , good . How did you come by this scar ? It happened not long ago . I was feeling as good as it gets . I just jumped ... into a moving car . What 's this ? Oh , that , nothing . Just some kid with a knife . Why do you take it on your own ... speed ? It 's like when I 'm eating or having sex I don 't like anyone watching me . Go for it . CHlSATO 'S DEAD AT midnight TOMORROW . So what , idiot ! What is it you want from me ? What 's happening tomorrow ? Mind your own business . What 's happening tomorrow ? There 's this other gang . Got no respect ... so we 're going to slug it out with them . The place ? You 're having a fun time ? And I 'm the one who 's going to tell the boss ? Are you totally sane ? Gota , hello ... - No ! - A lot of money ! Hey ! Hey ! You know whose car this is ? What 's your game ? Haven 't you heard who this car belongs to , asshole ? ( in Chinese ) Get rid of him fast . Me ? I 'll get a job same as everyone else . I can 't carry on like this . I 'll go to college to do science and engineering . I got it . What ? I 've got a bat studded with a whole heap of nails to use as a weapon . What about you ? Me ? I 'll only need my fists . I 'll beat the holy shit out of them , and flush ' em away . - We 're in this together . - That 's right . I 'm off in this direction . See you around . Hey , Goto . We 're going to put on a real show for those shitheads tonight . We 'll teach them how to spell the word respect . You don 't got problems , do you ? Idei ... I truly do intend to massacre them . I was told this was the place for guns ! Leave me alone ! Too many people ! Lease me one ! Sell me one ! I want a Chief 's Special . It 's got to be a Chief 's Special ! I 've been observing you . Do me a favor , and I 'll give you this . Marry me . I can 't return to my country anymore . More and more , I 've always got to find more money . More money and then more money . Therefore , becoming the wife of a Japanese man is the best thing for me . Can I ask you a question ? That man who got killed , the gun belonged to him , right ? He said if he was to die I was to forget him . So , I 'm forgetting everything . Is this where I sign and put my stamp ? I 'll come here sometimes and you can use me as your ' wife ' . Our wedding ceremony . Kiriko ... They 've got more manpower . No problem . We 'll take them . Goto , you handle that badass over there . - Don 't worry about the others . - Good . Now , let me think ... you and you ... Move it right now . You stay back there . Get back and stay there . Back to base ! Back to base ! Back to base ! He 's coming after me ! I hope you 're ready for him ! He 's here ! Get over here ! These guys are pussycats . CHlSATO 'S DEAD Stop right there ! Now what I believe we 've got ourselves caught up in a little gun play . In which case take this guy over to the club . This one better go back to his own pad . Chisato , Goto , you see to that . Just don 't take him to any damn hospital . And don 't leave that behind don 't forget . Hey you want to die or what ? I 've seen this ? Who d 'you send this to ? I 'm asking you ... Take it easy on that speed , will you ? I don 't touch it . What ? I don 't do it . Not now . What 's on your mind ? Don 't go too far . Nothing to do with you . Why are you always so far ahead of yourself ? What 's it to you ? My girl died in this place . Why did she kill herself ? Alright , you mother ! You want to know why ? You 're the reason why . You did it to her . And you didn 't even notice what you did ! All you ever thought of was you and you never even tried to get inside her head . But it 's not just you . You 're filth . I know there 're many just like you in the world . They all killed this woman . Go ahead . Go ahead . Do it yourself . Hey , that 's not what I meant . But it 's true I 'm the one who didn 't want to get married . But it 's OK . OK ? Don 't worry about it . I 've never much thought about the idea of marriage . I feel I 've always tried to ignore the important things in life . People have kids because it gives them a reason for staying alive . Without these things , you get lost , just like a kite in the wind with your string cut . This is an answering machine please wait for the tone and leave your message afterwards . Goda , about the commercials . I 've found a director to do them . Kiriko my string is just about to break . We didn 't have a child of our own . Hand over your wad right now ! What do you think you 're doing ? Take it ! Hey , everyone knows what 's going on . So take care of it . Somebody shoot some trash and put it under the highway . He 's getting up my nose . Nice and quiet . Goto , I 'm delegating you ... to celebrate your new job . What 's wrong with you ? We all know . You could be a good suit . Anyone will do . Anyone who smells bad , just zap them and that way you can hold your head up again . In dreams , you can kill people , and never get caught . Tokyo is just one big dream . A dream . ... please leave your message after the tone . Hi . Hi . Hi . Goto 's been hanging around in the same place for an hour , holding a gun . If he 's caught with it on him , it 's the last you 'll see of it . How does that grab you ? No ... One more time . I need to use it once more . You sure ? Is it for sure ? For sure . I 'm here . And he 's there . Goto was on this bicycle , and a cop thought he 'd stolen it and made out he was a thief . Cops like that are just filth in uniform . Goto doesn 't take to little men in uniforms . Hey , you ! Stop right where you are . Yes ? What 's this ? You again , huh . That 's not the same bike you had before . Where 're you going at this time of night ? Come here a moment . Here , I said . You come here . What did you say ? What 's this ? Have you painted over the registration plate ? I really do have to detain you . You 'd better come to the station . Can we go somewhere to talk about this ? Give me a break ! I 'm not wasting my time negotiating with punks . Excuse me ... Punk ! Just wait ! Hello . Hello . Hello . Hello . Hand it over . Give it back . It 's mine . You 're crazy . You 'll do . Shit ! If I 'd died with a gun in my hand , that would 've been something . It takes a lot of time and training , to be like you , huh ? Where are you ? Hey , where are you ? Hey ! There was a gang fight ? A boxer got shot dead . A boxer ! We 've done a lot of bad things in the course of our career ... But this thing ... shooting the boxer was really shitty . Rakar can compute what we intend to do in a fraction of a second , and from that can extrapolate all our moves over the next two years . Whatever we do , we can 't avoid fate . You didn 't shut the door . I came to ask you a favor . Two of the gang got killed . The rest are penned in the club . It 's only a matter of time before the hitman gets to us . I just wonder if there 's any chance of you working with us ... - ... to take out the hitman ? - I 'll do it . I 'm afraid . Let 's not do it then . That 's not what I meant . I 'm afraid that I 'll survive it . Having to go on is what 's frightening . Are you stupid ? You must be out of your tiny mind ! Why bring him in ? Do you really think he 'd be any use to us ? You actually gave him the gun ! For all you know , he may be the one who 's blown two of us away Am I getting through to you ? It 's OK . I won 't use it on you . What 's the problem ? Let him join us . Cool it , compadres . Everyone does his own thing . The game ain 't over yet . What are you trying to do ? Hey ... hey . Have a short nap . Hey ... No , mom . I 'm not coming home ! You kids , you shouldn 't play funny games . Well ... Shall we go ? So long , huh ? Yeah .

 Whoa ! Here , puppy ! Ugh ! ( groaning ) Wade : I 've decided to keep a journal of our experiences . We 've seen so many amazing things , I just want to have some kind of record of them . On this world , San Francisco feels like a small town . We 've been here almost 18 hours and we haven 't seen a single person who didn 't look content . Take a look at these prices . They 're amazing , aren 't they ? Reminds me of when I was a boy in England . Of course , the prices were in sterling then . What is this , " 1950s World " ? I don 't think so . I got a feeling I 'm really going to like this place . - Anybody got a buck ? - Sure . Wait a minute , I 've lost my wallet . Excuse me , sir . I think you dropped that . What a world . Amazing . There you are , my good man . Wade : No crime . No pollution or poverty . No racial strife . Maybe it 's because there 's a lottery here that simply gives out money whenever you want it . The sad thing is , we only have three days here . I 'm starting to wish we could stay forever . Excuse me , sir , is there a limit on this lottery ? - Are you folks from out of state ? - In a manner of speaking . The sky 's the limit . The more you take , the more chances you have to win . Thank you . The more you take , the better your chances ? These odds I like . Professor : Be very careful . We know nothing of this world . I suggest we take no more than we see other people taking . He 's right . " When in Rome ... " I played Rome in ' 83 . Rome 's expensive as hell . It would be good not to worry about money anymore . Rembrandt Brown . Room 12 at the Motel 12 . I 'd like $ 5,000 . There 's no such thing as something for nothing , Mr. Brown . That 's what I always thought until now . Excuse me . Professor Maximillian Arturo . Motel 12 , Room 12 . Five dollars , please . Thank you . Wade Wells . Room 12 at the Motel 12 . I 'd like $ 1,000 . Get down , you loathsome creature . Rembrandt : Henry 's just trying to be friendly , Professor . At least he 's not biting you . Mmm . ( giggles ) His affections are not appreciated . I love animals . I miss my kitty at home . And because you miss your kitty at home , we have to be subject to dog hair and saliva at every turn ? Frankly , yes . Come on , Henry . - Professor : Come along , you miserable hound . - Quinn : Let 's eat . You got to admire those high rollers , may they rest in peace . Quinn : What if you could find brand new worlds right here on Earth , where anything is possible ? Same planet , different dimension . I found the gateway . ( theme music plays ) Quinn : This guy loves the picnic basket . ( laughing ) Professor : Excuse me , sir , could you tell us how to get a taxi ? Just take one of the public cars , son . There are three of them right over there . You mean we just take them ? Sure , that 's what they 're there for . Thank you . Well , madam , you have a choice of color . The blue one . - Blue it shall be . - Shotgun ! " Golden Bay Rapid Transit . " ( laughs ) Come on , Henry . Wade : It doesn 't even need a key ! ( engine starts ) Professor : Say what you will , this languid pace certainly allows one to enjoy life 's simple pleasures . Listen to this ... according to this magazine , there 's only 500 million people on this world . Less than half a billion people in the entire world ? Why , that 's 10 % / % of the population of our Earth . Yeah , and the population of San Francisco is less than 100,000 . A smaller population is probably one of the antidotes to the ills of civilization . Fewer people , less pressure on resources , less stress . Who 's up for a horseback ride ? I 'm game . I 'll try anything once . I 'm going to pass on that . I 'd go for some fishing . That is a truly splendid idea . Nothing more satisfying than coaxing one 's supper from the depths . You fish ? I 'm English . We invented fishing . ( laughing ) Come on . - Rembrandt : Come on . - A spinning reel , Mr. Brown ? That 's hardly sporting , is it ? We 'll see who the sport is when I pull in the granddaddy . Fishing is not about mere tonnage , Mr. Brown . It 's about the competition that exists between the skill of the sportsman and the cunning of the actual fish . Observe . ( Rembrandt chuckles ) We 're not trying to catch blue jays , Professor . Let a real angler show you how it 's done . ( reel whirrs ) Isn 't this place great ? Sort of . That 's it , you 're doing great . Just keep the weight on the balls of your feet . ( laughs ) Look out ! ( groaning ) Whoo , what a rush . Let me see . Ouch . What are you looking at ? You . I thought we weren 't going to do this . When did we decide that ? It looks okay . Let 's just rest here a little while . Oh-hh . It 's so quiet and peaceful . It 's hard to believe this is San Francisco , huh ? Don 't you just feel incredibly at home here ? Not really . Are you kidding ? Look around . Beautiful countryside , people are so nice . It 'd be a great place to raise kids . Aren 't you getting a little ahead of yourself ? Why ? Because I 'm tired of sliding ? Because I 'm starting to think we 're never going to get home ? Wouldn 't it be better to stay someplace we know is good rather than get stuck somewhere terrible if the timer gives out ? Come on , Wade , don 't talk like that . Why not ? We 've been avoiding this issue for months . " Issue " ? What are you talking about ? Us . Face it , Quinn ... we are one another 's world , along with Rembrandt and the Professor . Maybe it 's time we faced facts . This is a great place . We should at least think about staying here . After one day ? We can 't throw everything away we 've been working for on the basis of pretty scenery . It 's not just that . ( sighs ) Forget it . Let 's just go , okay ? Despite protests from right-to-life extremists , President Jocelyn Elders attended the dedication of the newly reopened Thomas Malthus Center for Sexual Ethics and Education today . Congressional response was swift ... Who 's Thomas Malthus ? The Reverend Thomas Malthus was an English economist of the 19th century . He said that mankind would be forever condemned to live in misery because the population would always increase at a faster rate than the food supply . Evidently , in this world they took it to heart . Trout Almondine . Get it while it 's hot . Oh , wow ! You guys really caught all those ? See if you can guess which one is the Professor 's . ( both laugh ) It takes a sophisticated fly fisherman to haul in a monster like that . " Ha , ha , ha , " very funny indeed . Yes , we get the joke . - Q-Ball , you going to eat ? - " The Lottery Show , " with your host , Geoff Edwards . Thank you , thank you very much . Welcome to tonight 's drawing , brought to you by The Lottery Commission . Ooh , the Lottery . Edwards : Tonight , 12 lucky entrants will share prize money valued at more than $ 5 million each and receive unlimited white card privileges . The card that only Lottery winners can get . And the card that gives you everything ... everything your heart desires . Wish me luck , Henry . Let 's get over there and get our first selection going . And here it comes ... our first selection . Julianne Murphy , 3107 Grandview Lane . Wow , as beautiful as she is , and $ 5 million , too . There 's still 11 lucky Lottery winners left . Wade Wells , room 12 at the Motel 12 . - I won ? - Congratulations . Ms. Wells ... your every wish has just come true . I won ! ( laughs ) I won the Lottery ! Oh , how good does this world look now ? I haven 't been in a limo this size since the " Topps " broke up . Ms. Wells will be riding in limos for the rest of her life . Not the way I spend money . What if I wanted to give my money to the poor ? Unfortunately , the last poor person won the Lottery herself about six months ago . What 's the deal with this white card ? Very simple ... show it to any merchant , he gives you whatever you wish . You cannot be turned down . It 's society 's way of saying thanks . Damn , girl , some people have all the luck . Thanks for what ? Thanks for playing the Lottery . What else ? ( laughs ) ( laughing ) Welcome , sir . ( soft orchestral music playing ) ( groans ) That would look really sharp on you . Yeah . I like the blue . I don 't know . That red one 's pretty nice . Well ... buy them both . It 's not like they 're gonna charge you for it . ( laughing ) I hope you don 't mind , but Ms. Murphy , one of the other winners , was very excited to hear that you had arranged to show the Paris Fall Collection . - Wade : Not at all . - Sure . I mean , the more the merrier . Uh ... I 'll just get you a chair . I mean ... it would be a privilege to get a chair for a lady as beautiful as yourself . - That 's so sweet . Thank you . - It 's okay . Sit here . - Where are you going ? - For a walk . Excuse me a second . Quinn ? Please . Quinn ? What 's eating you ? Shopping for designer gowns isn 't my idea of a good time . I have to find something to wear to the Lottery Winners ' Ball tonight . This whole thing doesn 't add up , Wade . You can 't walk up to a machine , collect thousands of dollars , and if you 're really lucky , hit the big jackpot . Will you chill out ? We landed in Utopia . I 'm a multi-millionaire . You 're afraid I 'm going to stay here ... aren 't you ? Maybe . Quinn , this is a great world . I don 't know what I want to do yet . Whatever I decide , can 't we just try and enjoy ourselves ? It 's not that easy . Are you gonna take me to this thing tonight , or not ? I 'll be there . ( jazz music plays ) Neisser : Ms. Wells ! Welcome . This is for you so that we can identify the winners . Thank you . The men all get boutonnieres . I thought you weren 't going to make it . Rembrandt : Where 's Q-Ball ? He 's not back yet . Security seems awfully tight for a gala like this . In case the right-to-lifers cause a disturbance . Well , we 'll see you out on the dance floor . - Shall we ? - Why not ? A moment , Ms. Wells . I need you to fill out some forms . I 'll wait for you at the buffet . Okay . What is this ? A beneficiary form . Next of kin . Nothing out of the ordinary . Okay . I left mine to the Sierra Club . I 'm Ryan . This is for you . Thank you . You 're Wade Wells , aren 't you ? How do you know my name ? I saw you on television the night they announced the winners . If you hurry and sign that , I can ask you to dance . Let 's go . Okay . ( sighs ) Are you all right ? Sweetheart , I told you I was " The Crying Man . " I really feel happy . I feel as if I 'm the one who won the Lottery . No one 's ever cried over me before . Oh , get ready , sweetheart , because I 'm gonna be shedding lots of tears over you . ( sighs ) You know what I want ? What 's that ? I 'd like to spend the rest of my life with you . Priest : We don 't want zero population growth . The Lottery must be stopped . What 's happening in there is wrong ! We must stop the bloodshed . Read it . It 'll change your life . Rembrandt : I used to write songs about love at first sight , but nothing like this . ( Julianne laughs ) What kind of song would you write about us ? Sweetheart , for you , I 'd write a symphony . Take me , Rembrandt . Right here . Right now . - Right here ? - Um-hmm . I 'm a white card holder . I can have anything I want . And I want you . I want you too , Julianne ... but shouldn 't we go to your room or something ? The winners have to be here for the midnight toast . And I don 't think I can wait that long . ( laughs ) That 's basically it . I was a Romantic lit major in school . Ryan : " Wine goes in at the mouth ... Love goes in at the eye ... That 's all we shall know for truth Till we grow old and we die . " Wade : That 's " A Drinking Song " by Yeats . - Ryan : Um-hm . - I wrote a paper on him . I am so in awe of poets ... the way they express themselves ... it 's a gift I wish that I had . I think you express yourself just fine . What else do you like ... besides poetry ? Well , I love traveling . My goal was to climb Everest , swim the English Channel , and paddle the Amazon before I was 30 . - Wow , did you really do all that ? - Yeah . And I thought I liked adventure . All that was left was winning the Lottery . And ... you are the best part of that . ( laughs ) ( uptempo music continues ) Do you realize what a wonderful world this is ? I mean , don 't you wake up in the morning and feel grateful that you weren 't born on some other godforsaken piece of rock ? Frankly , I don 't think about it . Hmm ... well , you should . Trust me . I 'm a physicist . I know . There are far worse places than this . The truth is , I 'm a hypocrite . Every day I work with Lottery winners . Good , decent men and women making honorable sacrifices for society . I don 't see how that makes you a hypocrite . ( whispers ) I 'm afraid of death . I 'm sorry , I don 't follow your reasoning . Excuse me , is your name on the list ? Professor ! - Security : Hold it there , sir ! - Excuse me . I 'm a guest of Wade Wells . - She 's one of the winners . - Check the list . I 'm afraid she already brought her escort . ( laughs ) I 've got to get inside . Uh , sir ? I 'm glad you came . There 's something wrong here . Professor , we 've got to get her out of here . Listen ... this lottery , it 's population control . What ? That 's what " winning " means . Tomorrow morning , they 're gonna kill Wade . ( laughs ) This can 't be true . My , God ... it says the Lottery has killed 50,000 people nationwide . They don 't call it death . Everybody 's in a rush to the afterlife . They call it " making way . " Maybe these right-to-lifers are some kind of crackpots . These right-to-lifers are Nobel prizewinning philosophers and scientists . Believe it . Still think this is paradise ? This is no time for acrimony . Find a way of getting her out of here . I 'll tell you how we get her out of here . The same way we came in . Through the front door . Then hightail it for the woods and hide overnight , till we slide . - I can 't . - Didn 't you hear what I just said ? Quinn , there is no way to hide . Every move I make is chaperoned until this party is over . Wade ... ? Everything okay ? I 'll be with you in a minute , Ryan . Who 's he ? Another lucky winner . Look , I 've got to go , okay ? I 'll see you guys back at the room . Listen , I 've got a question . Since we 're sliding out of here in the morning could we maybe bring somebody with us ? - Rembrandt ! - Look , I mean it , man . She 's good people . We just can 't leave her here . Mr. Brown , we understand the extent of your personal involvement , but the risk is too great . Explain . I 'm not saying it 's impossible , Rembrandt . But the more people we take in the wormhole , the more energy it drains from the system . There 's no guarantee we 'd make it to the next world safely . I just can 't let her die , man . All right . Let me see what we can do . It 's barbaric . On the contrary , my boy ... in some ways it 's more humane than our society . Professor , they kill people to limit the population . In our world , millions of people die every year through war , famine , disease , caused in part by the fact that we refuse to accept limits on our population . Here , they kill volunteers ... painlessly , and generously reward their beneficiaries . Now ... you may abhor their methods ... as indeed do I ... but as a man of science , you cannot dismiss the result . Neisser : Society owes all of you a great debt , it 's true . As much as we envy you , we are appreciative of this sacrifice . Now that you all have your departure times , we 'd appreciate your cooperation in making this as efficient and pleasant a making way as possible . Could I speak to you for a second ? Efficiency is as important to us ... What ? We 're missing the speech . Julianne , there 's something I need to say . I have real feelings for you , and the thought of going on without you is almost too painful to contemplate . What are you saying , Rembrandt ? I see a future with you , and I want us to go on together . ( laughs ) You mean it ? You want to die with me ? Die with you ? Julianne , there is something I need to explain . ( ringing ) - Wade ? - No , man , it 's me . Listen , I 've explained everything to Julianne , and she 's cool . She understands about the slide ? I told her to keep an open mind . She 's upstairs packing . I 'm gonna go up and collect her in a couple of minutes . Q - Ball , I really appreciate this . Let 's just hope it works . Is Wade with you ? No . Last time I saw her she was with Ryan . Take care , Rembrandt , see you in a bit . Later . Ryan : So who was that guy ? The guy that showed up late . He 's a friend . I 'm not getting in the middle of something , am I ? It 's sort of a long story . Ryan , I can 't . What 's the matter ? This is just happening way too fast . Ordinarily I would say let 's take it slow , but we 're scheduled to make way in the morning . Can I trust you ? To my grave . What I 'm about to say is going to sound pretty shocking . I 'm from a parallel world . What ? It 's not going to make a whole lot of sense . The point is I entered this lottery under false pretenses . I don 't want to die . Wait a minute ... you 're not a right-to-lifer , are you ? No ... I don 't understand the way this society works , okay ? Right-to-lifers and everything . The point is I 've got to get out of here . My friends ... those guys you saw me with ... we 're scheduled to leave in a couple of hours . You realize what you 're saying ? In the first place , they 're not going to let you leave . You 'll get the process . The " process " ? The penalty for subverting the Lottery system . They 'll make you pay in pain before they kill you . ( sirens blare ) What are those sirens ? The Lottery police . You didn 't say anything about this to anybody , did you ? No . It must be the demonstrators . Ryan , listen to me . If you help me , then neither one of us has to die tomorrow . You can come with us . No , see , I shouldn 't even be listening to this . You have no idea what these people are capable of . Ryan , wait . No . For your own good , okay ? Don 't even think about it . ( police radio chatter ) Julianne ? Come in , Rembrandt . So now , are we ready ? Rembrandt Brown ? Lottery Police . You 're under arrest . - You have the right to remain silent ... - Rembrandt : Wait a minute . ... if you choose to do so , it can and will be used against you in a court of law . Mr. Brown , are you now or have you ever been , a member of The Right - To-Life movement ? I don 't know anything about any " right-to-life movement . " Julianne , what 's going on ? I 'm sorry , Rembrandt . I couldn 't let you do it . - You turned me in ? - I had to . I wouldn 't let you jeopardize my family 's inheritance . Wait a minute , what is this ? I thought you loved me . I do . But obviously , you were delusional and in need of help , How could I turn my back on that ? This is your idea of help ? Yes . We 're about to be bonded eternally . We 'll always be together . Together ? ( siren wails , angry voices ) What the hell 's going on out there ? The police . - Professor : What time is it ? - Quinn : Almost 4 : 00 . Where the hell are they ? I don 't know . I 'm gonna find out . ( knocking ) - ( door opens ) - Man : Yes ? Lottery agent : Lt 'll just be a few minutes . Hello , Rembrandt . I 'm so glad you 're here . It 's not like I had a choice . I really misjudged you , Rembrandt . Yeah ? Well , it looks like I misjudged you , too . You 're so misguided ... so afraid of death . That 's why you 're here ... To be liberated from your fears . Thanks , but I think I do just fine on my own . You must see ... that there 's nothing to be afraid of , my dear Rembrandt . Fear is what kills . Love lives forever . Here you are , Julianne . Mmmm . Tastes so good , Rembrandt . Like ... ambrosia . Julianne ... I 'm gonna lie back a little . I already feel like I 'm floating . ( laughs ) Ooh . I see a white light . It 's all around me . It 's through me . ( laughs ) There 's nothing to fear . Take my hand . I 'm going with the light now . She 's made way . She can 't protect you anymore . Wait a minute . What are you guys doing ? We 're taking you to the Municipal Processing Center . Municipal Processing Center ? Where 's that ? That 's where you 're gonna die , Mr. Brown . Most uncomfortably . Where the hell have you been ? Where 's Quinn ? He 's out looking for you and the lovesick Mr. Brown . - We need to walk the dog . - We don 't need to walk the dog . The dog is perfectly fine . We need to walk the dog now ! ( silent ) Ah ... well , since you put it that way , yes , of course , I think we need to walk the dog . Come on , Henry . Come on , old boy . - ( dog barks ) - Come on , you old woofer ! - I couldn 't talk in the room because it 's probably bugged . - So I gathered . Tampering with the Lottery is the worst crime you can commit on this world . This whole thing is being monitored . If we don 't find Quinn and Rembrandt soon , - we 're all gonna die here . - ( siren wails , stops ) - ( voices murmuring ) - Something 's happening . Excuse me , what 's going on ? Some guy was trying to kidnap one of the Lottery winners . Wade : Oh , my God . Rembrandt : Hey , guys ... you gotta help me . - What are they going to do with him ? - Redcap : The process , sir . He 's gonna regret the day he screwed with the Lottery . ( siren howls ) Wade ! Professor ! They 've got Rembrandt . I know . What the hell did you tell Ryan ? - You think Ryan turned him in ? - Who else could have done it ? - I can 't believe that . - They 're taking Rembrandt to Geary Street . - A place called Municipal Processing Center . - We 've got to go get him . No , you 're staying here . Otherwise they 'll think you 're trying to escape . If you miss the slide , they 'll kill you . Wait for us in the ballroom . If we 're not back in time ... slide without us . Let 's go , Professor . ( siren blares ) So you 're about to die . Now you wait a minute . I 'm sure you have many questions . Yeah , like how the hell do I get out of here ? ! Rest easy , friend . You are about to experience the ultimate adventure . The magical journey from our world to the great beyond . I 'm too young to die ! I 'm too famous ! When you first pass over you will find yourself in a long , dark tunnel headed for a brilliant patch of light . A loved one , perhaps a relative who passed years back , will appear to guide you into the light . My dead relatives were a pain in the butt ! I don 't care to deal with any of ' em ! Now get me out of here ! This has gone too far ! Come on , now ! Priest on megaphone : All life is precious . The Lottery is sacrilege ! Yeah ! Zero population growth ... must be achieved ... through birth control only ! ( cheering ) We must stop the Lottery before it 's too late . ( siren howls ) Priest : We must stop the Lottery now ! Stop the Lottery ! Stand clear of the van , please . What 's going on ? Failure to disperse will result in immediate physical response . ( crowd yells ) He 's still in the van . Failure to disperse will result in immediate physical response ! Our friend 's in there ! His only crime is wanting to live . Our friend 's in there ! His only crime is wanting to live ! Stand fast there , believers ! He tried to help a Lottery winner stay alive ! He 's a hero ! Not a criminal ! Stop the slaughter ! All : Stop the slaughter ! Stop the slaughter ! Priest : Stop the slaughter ! Stop the slaughter ! All : Stop the slaughter ! Stop the slaughter ! Priest : Stop the slaughter ! Stop the slaughter ! ( chanting continues ) What ? Priest : Stop the slaughter ! Stop the slaughter ! - Rembrandt ! - Man , am I glad to see you . Never criticize my fishing again ! Come on . We 've got a real situation here ! Where the hell 's the backup ? Quinn : Come on , let 's get out of here . How much time ? Not much . Let 's move ! Pedal to the metal , Q-Ball ! I can 't wait to get off this Earth . Hey ! Where are you going ? Move out ! Secure the area ! Rembrandt : It 's no use ! We 're gonna have to run for it ! - You almost killed me ! - Sorry , man . Gotta go . Next time , I get to drive ! Come on , you guys . ( barks ) Shhh . Quiet . Neisser : I thought I heard something . Ms. Wells ? - ( dog barks ) - Shhh . Hit the lights . ( dog barks ) Neisser : There she is . Oh-hh ! Let me go ! Get your hands off of me ! ( groans ) - Ryan ? - Neisser : What 's going on out there ? Ugh ! - Do you know what you just did ? - Oh , yeah . So you better be telling the truth about " parallel worlds . " ( sighs ) We 've got less than a minute . My friends aren 't here yet . Quinn : We are now ! Run ! Go ! ( beeping ) It 's time ! - Slide ! - I 'm out of here ! Go , Professor ! Go ! ( yelling ) Go ! Jump , go ! ( screams ) Police : It 's clear . Oh ! Ow-ww ! - We made it . - Everybody okay ? - Whew ! Unbelievable ! - What did I tell you ? Quinn ? - Oh , my God . - Quinn ? No !

 Max ? Max , you there ? - [ Match Striking ] - [ Gasps ] You 're late , kid . - You get lost ? - Sorry . I had to wait till my mom took off . It 's way past his bedtime , Max . He 's not cut out for this . Cut out for what ? Oh , there 's more here than just trees . Before you can find out what , I gotta know that you 're not gonna tell anyone about this place . I won 't . I swear . It 's a vow , Tony . Don 't make it if you 're gonna break it . I won 't break it , man . Not ever . No matter what ? Even if someone dies tonight ? [ Car Approaching ] [ Siren Wails ] Anthony Reed . - Got any outstanding warrants ? - No , of course not . Well , I 'm gonna have to check it out for myself . So , put your hands on the vehicle . - Look , I was just taking a walk . - Uh-huh . Right past all those big " no trespassing " signs ? Now you just stand there for a minute . Come on , man . I didn 't do anything . I wish I had a nickel for every time I had to drag you kids out of these woods . It 'd be a lot of nickels . Do you have any calls from dispatch ? [ Policeman Screams ] Sir ? [ Woman Over Radio ] Dispatch to Foster . I didn 't copy your last transmission . Officer ? Dispatch to Foster , do you copy ? Deputy Foster , this is Dispatch . Do you copy ? Deputy Foster , sir , what 's your 20 ? [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Oh . There you are . Heavy traffic ? Slow going . Let 's just say I had ample time to read the police report you faxed me . Thoughtfully provided by the local authorities , even though it doesn 't tell the whole story . A sheriff 's deputy is slain during a routine patrol . It 's a tragic occurrence , but I don 't see the mystery here , Mulder . Except said that the deputy was beaten to death by an invisible assailant . Yes , but that 's according to the young man who 's accused of his murder . One Tony Reed , and I 'm guessing wrongfully accused . He 's an " A " student , moved here a few months ago from Philadelphia . He 's never been in trouble in his life . Tell me you 've got more than S.A.T. Scores to show that Tony Reed didn 't commit this crime . Maybe . Take a look at the body . The former Deputy Ronald Foster . As you can see , the report doesn 't quite do it justice . Oh , my God . It looks like he was hit with a sledgehammer . Police flashlight . One blow . Damage to the maxilla facial bones and the cranium ... is consistent with a blunt force trauma , but ... I 'd say that Tony eats his Wheaties . Check out the back of his head . [ Gasps ] His eyeglasses . Penetrated to the back of his skull . Babe Ruth couldn 't hit this hard , let alone a high school sophomore . Well , maybe if he was under the influence of P.C.P. Or some kind of stimulant . - No , his tox screen came back negative . - Well , even so , I mean , stress and fear may have triggered an adrenalin response which is known to ... enable feats of near super human strength . Agent Mulder ? How long you plannin on bein 'down here ? Sheriff Harden , this is my partner , Agent Scully . How long you plan on bein ' down here ? I 'd like Ron left in peace . I don 't know what there is to see anyway . - We got the kid who did it . - Sheriff , we don 't mean to second-guess you . - We 're just hoping to be of some assistance . - Well , I don 't need it . I got the murder weapon with bloody fingerprints , and once the state crime lab matches that up with Tony Reed , it 's open and shut . - Well , uh , we 're done here , right ? - Mm-hmm . But , Sheriff Harden , you won 't mind if I talk to Tony Reed , do you ? I mean , it won 't hurt your case . And if he did do it , you 'll wanna know why . What ? Well , Tony , this must be your lucky day for visitors . - This is Agent Scully with the F.B. I ... - I 'm not talkin ' anymore , okay ? Well , that might make things worse . They seem pretty bad already . In your statement , you say that Deputy Foster stopped you . But you don 't say why . Come on . You were cruisin ' , right ? I mean , a small town like this , you 're not exactly living ' la vida loca . I know . I grew up in Dullsville too . Nothing to do but drive and park . How long ago was that ? Look . Don 't you think I know what you 're doing ? You 're like the tenth cop who 's come in here trying to relate to me till I confess . If you didn 't do it , it 's all the more reason to clear it up . Everything I know ... is in my statement . Okay , but bear with us , 'cause we 're old and stupid . How long was it between the time you heard the scream ... to the time that you found Deputy Foster ? Tony , you 're not likely to get a fairer hearing than this . Maybe ten , fifteen seconds . You didn 't see anyone near the patrol car ? You didn 't hear anything ? And you 're still gonna stick with your story ... that you were the only one there , is that right ? Uh ... I wanna go back to my cell . Sixteen years old and his life is over unless he starts telling ' the truth . If you really think he 's guilty , why don 't you ask yourself this : Why wouldn 't he make up a more plausible cover story ? Why didn 't he say that a pickup full of hillbillies ... drove by and clobbered the deputy and ran away ? I 'm not saying he 's guilty . I 'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed did not commit murder . But I think that he saw the person who did , and he may be covering up for it . I 'm not sure there was a person to see . I think there was a force at work here . - What kind of force ? - Some kind of territorial or spiritual entity maybe . Poltergeists have long been associated with violent acts like this , and they tend to manifest around young people . They seem to be drawn to the turmoil of adolescence . Mulder , rather than spirits , can we at least start with Tony 's friends ? Please , just ... for me ? I think there 's one person in particular I 'd like to talk to . [ Man ] Let 's wrap it up , people . Two-minute warning ' . There goes half your grade , Max . - You missed the midterm . - Not if I take it right now . - In one minute ? - Oh , I 've been studying . I don 't care who your father is . You fail my test , it sticks . I guess I better ace it then , huh ? Take your seat , young man . - Piece of cake . - It is when you mark ' em at random . Go ahead . Check it . Maybe I got more goin ' on than people know . [ Bell Ringing ] Chastity Raines ? I 'm Agent Scully . This is Agent Mulder . We 're with the F.B.I. - I remember you . - Chastity , what did you and Tony talk about this morning ? - He didn 't kill that cop . - How can you be so sure ? - Tony just doesn 't have it in him . - Do you ? Were you there when it happened ? Look , I gotta go . Do you realize that Tony could go to prison for the rest of his life for this ? Chastity , if you know something , now 's the time to mention it . - Unless they got a warrant , you don 't have to say nothin ' . - Wow . You must be her lawyer . Let 's go . Butting into our investigation . I wonder what your father , the sheriff , would think . - How do you know who my dad is ? - You got the same last name . Oh , you 're good . We 're done here . Come on , babe . You must 've been a Betty back in the day . - A " Betty " ? - " Back in the day . " [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Scully . What about the murder weapon ? All I know is we put the flashlight in here and now it 's gone . It 's like it just disappeared into thin air . - How many people have access to this evidence room ? - Only me and the dozen deputies . What does the tape show ? That no unauthorized persons came in and no one went anywhere near this locker . - Was this here before ? - I don 't know . Can we take a look at the surveillance tape ? [ Sheriff ] You can see that the flashlight was properly secured . It 's not like we 're runnin 'some kind of half-assed operation here . No one 's saying that you are , Sheriff . Here 's when the state police showed up to take it to the crime lab . There 's me goin 'to get it . We opened up the locker , and it 's gone . I maybe , uh , didn 't give you all the warmest welcome , but if you have any ideas . - May I ? - I watched it a dozen times . - Could there be a malfunction with the V.C.R. ? - I don 't see how . Plus , there 's no gap in the time code . The murder weapon was the only hard evidence we had . Without it , we got no case . You know what I gotta do now ? I gotta call Ron Foster 's widow and tell her that I gotta turn his killer loose . Scully , check this out . - What am I supposed to be seeing ? - Here it comes . Now you see it . One more frame . Now you don 't . What do you make of that , Scully ? Take another look . Now it 's here . Now it 's not . Are you ready to be straight with me ? Leave me alone , Mom . Would you just leave me alone . I 'm tired ! This isn 't like a bad report card , Anthony . A man is dead . I told you , I didn 't do it ! It 's just that what you say happened doesn 't make sense . There 's gotta be more to it . Well , there isn 't . Okay ? Are those kids involved in this ? That boy Max ? No . - Mom , they 're the only friends I have here . - You 're done seeing ' ' em . - You don 't even know them . - I do know them . I was your age once . Tony , we came here to get a fresh start , get away from them bad schools , the wrong crowd . You are doing so well here . How would you know ? You 're never around . You think it 's my dream to work two jobs ? I 'm doin ' it for you , Tony . I just wanna get some sleep . That 's all I want . You got a chance at a good life , a real future . We didn 't come all this way so you could throw it away . [ Tapping On Window ] Listen to that , man . This car 's got guts . - Sort of like you that way . - Whose car is this , Max ? Chastity told you to shut up and sit tight and things would be fine . - You did that . It tells me a lot . - Everything 's not fine . We 're in a stolen car , a cop is dead . Calm down , man . He 'd been snooping ' around . He had to go . What do you mean , " He had to go " ? What happened out there ? You gotta learn not to ask so many questions . Slow the hell down , man ! You 're freakin ' me out ! You ain 't seen nothin ' yet . - [ Tires Screeching ] - Max , look out ! [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] I 'm gonna make you one of us . But I call the shots . Always remember that . Hey , Chuck . Sorry to make you trek over here for what 's probably a glitch . - What 'd you come up with ? - Nothing but eye strain at first . Then I ran it through my imaging software . I 'm here to tell you , it 's not a glitch . It 's what the camera saw . Buckle up , Scully . I believe Chuck is about to take us on a ride through the paranormal . Yes and no . Initially , I was thinking spectral manifestation . But with spirit activity , you 'd expect to see light streaks , auras , atmospheric disturbances , translucent figures . Whatever this is , it 's not a ghost . Especially since ghost don 't go around leaving synthetic polymers in their wake . That 's what the gunk on the floor turned out to be . Huh . I dig a mystery with layers . Chuck , I get the feeling you don 't know what the hell this is . I cross-referenced the shape 's silhouette ... against every organic and inorganic object in the Library of Congress database . The closest match was a Soviet Akula class submarine . I think we can rule that out . And then there 's this weirdness . - My enhancement brought up this dark edge ... - [ Mulder ] Mm-hmm . Around the anomaly . - A shadow . - It fit with the lighting in the room . - The problem is it can 't be throwing a shadow unless ... - Unless it 's a solid object . Which is impossible because it only appears for a single frame . One-thirtieth of a second . You know what ? Maybe , uh , SCAG can give us a clearer picture . - SCAG ? - Spectrographic Color Attribute Generator . I 'm beta testing it forJ.P.L. It 's still in the tweaking phase , but the basic idea is ... I assign known color values ... onto the black-and-white image . Then SCAG assigns chromatic values throughout the frame , in effect making an educated guess at , uh , what all the colors might be . It still needs fine tuning . What ? You recognize these colors , Scully ? - Hey , Tony . - Everyone 's looking at me like I 'm a criminal . I 'm not . I heard you took a ride . What was that ? How did he do it ? You 'll find out . Maybe you were right ... about me not bein ' cut out for this . It 's a little late for second thoughts . You tryin ' to move in on my girl ? - [ Bell Ringing ] - Saved by the bell . Hey , you wanna stare at someone ? Stare at me . Well , class . I graded your midterms . Save for a few of you , the news is not good . Mr. Pembleton . What happened ? Welcome back , Mr. Reed . Expect to make up the test tomorrow . Mr. Harden , you 're here on time for a change . What 's this ? - Self-explanatory , isn 't it ? - I got every answer right . - Not because you knew the material . - You sayin ' I cheated ? How ? I have no idea how . But you did . And I won 't tolerate it . [ Man ] Back to business , people . - [ Door Opens , Closes ] - Mr. Guider ? How do I tell Max that I want out ? I wish I could help you , Tony . I can 't even help myself . [ Boy ] Babbit ! [ Screams ] [ Screaming ] [ Girl ] Oh , my God ! Excuse me , please . Thank you . Just stay back . I 'll show you my theory if you show me yours . Based on the eyewitness accounts of the students I spoke to , at this moment I 'd have to say that I don 't have one . What about for these globs of goo ? - The ones we found in the evidence room ? - Yeah . I 'm guessing Max Harden could tell us how they got there . You think Max did this ? Based on what ? I spoke to a few students myself . Apparently Max was angry at Mr. Babbit ... because he failed him on his midterm exam , so he had motive . Well , he may have had motive , but he didn 't have opportunity . There was nobody here who saw him even go near the victim . Maybe he didn 't need to . I pulled his records . Rising attendance and discipline problems the last few months . But look at this transcript . As his behavior was getting worse , his grades were going through the roof . - This kid has changed , Scully . - He 's a teenager . Everything about him is changing . His body and his brain chemistry is in a state of unparalleled upheaval , plus there 's peer pressure and-and substance abuse . Any one of these factors could alter his behavior radically . What if it 's given him a kind of psychokinetic or paranormal ability ... that allows him to exert force over a victim without ever laying a finger on him ? - That 's your theory ? - Yes , it is . Soon to be proven as soon as I get Max in for questioning . - Agent , you needed to speak to Sheriff Harden ? - Yeah . - I want to talk to him about his son . - He 's with him now . They 're taking him to the emergency room . Max just collapsed in the parking lot . You hear about Max ? Is he okay ? - Where are you going ? - Tony , the less you know , the better , all right ? What , no candy , no flowers ? [ Sheriff ] My deputy told me you were comin 'and why . So you can just turn around . Whatever happened at that school , my son didn 't do it . Sheriff , we 'd like to ask your son a few questions , if that 's okay . The boy 's sick . The doctors can 't even say what 's wrong with him . Max could tell them . You know why you collapsed , don 't you , Max ? Yeah . Too much teen spirit . You think ? Smells like murder to me . Who do you think you 're talkin 'to here ? Yeah , it 's not like you got a damned thing on me . You got a problem with authority figures , don 't you , Max ? If I wasted Babbit , then how did I do it ? Am I like Carrie or somethin ' ? I used some kind of mental powers ? No , somethin 'else . You figured out a way to tap into something that gives you super powers . Came in handy with Babbit and Deputy Foster . Man , you 're whistlin " Dixie . " High temperature and heart rate . Low blood sugar . Electrolytes show acidosis . All these symptoms are consistent with extreme exertion and withdrawal . Withdrawal ? From what ? The rush . I think whatever it is that gives you the power to rearrange furniture ... and turn a flashlight into a battering ram also gives you quite a buzz . Well , if I can do all that , what 's stoppin ' me from doin ' it to you ? I don 't know . Maybe the effect 's worn off . Maybe you need another fix . As soon as I blow out of here , I 'll be sure to get one . That 's not gonna happen any time soon . Your condition 's getting worse . And we 're not gonna be able to help you unless you can tell us what 's going on . Boy , is any of this true ? - No . - You better pray I don 't find out it is . Sir ? Can we have a word outside ? He 's not a bad kid . He just needs discipline . If your son is in trouble , I 'm sure you 'd want to know about it . With that in mind , we 'd like permission to search your house . You 're not getting it . I 'm not ready to jump on a bandwagon and call my boy a murderer . There 's some , uh , test results missing from Max 's chart . I think we should track ' em down . Thanks . Hot off the presses . Anything interesting ? - This can 't be right . - What is it ? Oh , my God . What ? Evidence of cerebral lesions from repeated concussions . Arthritis in the spine and major joints . Stress fractures . Numerous muscle and ... - and ligament micro-tears . - What would cause this ? In a teenager ? I can 't even imagine . This is the kind of thing that you 'd see in someone who 's crashed race cars ... or played pro football for 15 years . Whatever Max is doing , it 's killing him . I think I 'm starting to get it . [ Beeping ] - I thought I saw a young lady come in here . - I wish . Max Harden 's personal effects . Yeah . This is it . Those globs we found ... this is where they came from . Speed , Scully . Somehow Max Harden has found a way ... - to move faster than the eye can see . - Mulder . That would explain how Babbit was killed . It would also explain how a chair and table ... appeared to move on their own with enough force to penetrate a wall . Force equals mass times acceleration . Isn 't that right ? Yes , but it 's impossible . The human body isn 't designed to move like that . Exactly . That is ... That is why his is falling apart . Agents , could you ... Max ... Max , please don 't do this . You can stop . Sure . Just like you can . I mean hurting people . Haven 't enough people already been hurt ? This is not why I got you out ! - Let 's leave here . Let 's just go away . - And do what ? Find a place to get some help . Help for what ? This is the best thing that 's ever happened to me . I can 't go back to things standing ' still . And neither can you . Tony , what are you doing here ? You went in that cave , didn 't you ? You shouldn 't have done that . It was such a rush ... moving fast like that . I didn 't want this for you . How did you find it ? I followed you . I was worried about you . That 's so sweet . I wish things were different than how they are . Maybe they can be . With Max in the hospital , we could go to the cops . He 's out . Oh , my God . [ Door Opens ] Hello ? Boo . You killed Ron Foster . Yeah , I did . Why ? I don 't know . You want some great reason ? You little son of a bitch ! [ Groans ] He thought he was really somethin ' . Always liked to push people around . Same as Babbit ... and same as you . I 'm not afraid of you anymore . I can 't let you do this , Max . - Take him to O.R. One . - All right . Yo , Scully . How bad are his injuries ? It 's too soon to tell . He 's unconscious and bleeding internally , apparently from a blow to the abdomen . Yeah , delivered with this . Max 's weapon of choice against cops . Why would he leave it behind ? Do you think he 's doing it to taunt the police ? No , I think somebody intervened . I think that 's why the sheriff is still alive and why his gun is missing . But if he can do what you claim , then ... then who could possibly intervene ? The someone who knows exactly how Max does what he does . And someone who 's finally standing up to him . Tony . How do we find him ? Well , I would guess the source where Max gets his power from . The woods near where the deputy was killed . Tony never came clean about what he was doing out there . Well , maybe that 's why the deputy was killed . Maybe he got too close to the truth . [ Tony ] Chastity , we don 't have to be doing this . I told you , I took care of things with Max . No , you didn 't , and you shouldn 't have tried . - He was gonna kill his father . I had to stop him . - He let you . He was slowing down . Tony , you 've slowed down too . If we don 't get back to the cave before Max does , we 're history . - Hurry ! - I 'll catch up . Chastity ? Are you okay ? [ Max ] You 're late , kid . - What did you do to her ? - She took a swing at me . You believe that ? You got it all turned around . [ Groans ] Come on , man . Who do you think you 're dealin ' with ? All I ever wanted was you to be my friend , Tony . You stuck a knife in my back . And now I 'm gonna mess you up . [ Screaming ] I 'm sorry , Tony . I can 't go back . [ Gun Blast ] Chastity ? [ Beeping ] [ Footsteps ] Did the U.S.G.S. Show up ? Eighteen geologists and three semis full of gear . They covered every inch of that cave . - And what 'd they come up with ? - Nothing . A little bat guano and above normal magnetic field readings , but nothing that would cause a physiological effect . - What 'd you expect them to find , Mulder ? - I don 't know . A vortex like the one in Oregon . Gravitational aberrations , unique chemical compositions , relics that would indicate the cave was a sacred site . Something . Anything . I don 't know . You and I were both in there , and nothing happened to us . We 're still slow-poking around . What if we 're too old ? You said teenagers differ ... from adults chemically and physiologically . What if whatever 's in that cave effects only them ? Well , that 's doubtful . But no more so than any other theory . I mean , it 's worth checking out . Yeah ? Well , we can 't . As of an hour ago , they pumped concrete into the cave , sealed it for precautionary reasons . We 'll never know . How 's he doin ' ? Bruises and muscle strains mostly . He 'll recover . Go back to being a normal kid . [ Child ] I made this ! Three . Give me two . Two . Can I have five cards , please ? Five ? What , are you serious ? Four 's the limit . Let 's see your ace . If Mr. Weems wants five , give him five . [ Dealing Cards ] Dealer takes two . Four . Nah . - How much is that ? - [ Dealer ] Four grand keeps you in ... you and your five shiny new cards . [ Chuckles ] There 's 4,000 . And four more . Let 's make this interesting . I 'm raising you 15 large . I wouldn 't do that . This is all I need . You 're gonna need Depends ... after you see this hand . Now we show each other our cards ? [ Sighs ] Four kings . That 's a straight flush , right ? Beginner 's luck . - What the hell do you think you 're doin ' ? - Going home . No , no . Not so fast . We expect a chance to win some of our money back . Guys , there 's over a hundred thousand dollars here . You 're damn right there 's over a hundred thousand dollars there . A hundred thousand 's all I need . Sorry . I had fun , though . Where can I cash out ? # # [ Soft Rock Playing Over Speakers ] Guys , I think we 're going up instead of down . Guys ? Guys , this is not what I meant by " cashing out . " Hey ! Hey ! [ Screaming ] [ Grunts ] - [ Line Ringing ] - [ Mulder ] Hello ? Mulder , it 's me . What now ? - Are you in Chicago ? - Yes , I 'm in Chicago . I 'm on the northeast corner of Seventh and Hunter just like you asked . Only you 're not here . So where are you ? Oh , around . - Yeah ? - Hey , nice outfit . Hey . What 's down there ? Before you check out down there , check out up there . The top two floors are leased to oneJimmy Catrona , - whose name you might be familiar with . - Organized crime . The Bureau 's been trying to build a racketeering case against him the past few years . Gambling , extortion , murder . Which is why last night there were two agents parked across the street in surveillance . They witnessed a man being thrown from Catrona 's roof at 10 : 40 p.m. This man fell 30 floors , plus the distance down this shaft ... because these doors just happened to be open , straight through , nothing but net . - Ouch . - I 'm guessing that 's what he said ... after he got up , climbed out of here and scampered off into the night . - Mulder , you keep saying this man . Who is this man ? - No idea . He got away . The agents gave chase , but no clear description . - Was this basement thoroughly searched ? - No . Technically , falling 300 feet and surviving isn 't a crime . And your theory is ? What if this man had some kind of special capability ... some kind of genetic predisposition towards ... rapid healing or tissue regeneration ? So basically , what we if were looking for Wile E. Coyote ? You 're saying that he 's invulnerable . - Right ? - Yeah . In 1998 , there was a British soldier who plummeted 4,500 feet when his parachute failed . Then he walked away with a broken rib . - What 's your point ? - My point is that if there 's ... a wind gust or a sudden updraft , and plus if he landed in exactly the right way ... I mean , I don 't know . Maybe he just got lucky . What if he got really , really lucky ? That 's your big scientific explanation , Scully ? I mean , how many thousands of variables would have to convene ... - in just the right mixture for that theory to hold water ? - I don 't know . No . Thousands . - Mulder ? - Yeah ? [ Scully ] Look at this . If this cart were on the platform when he hit , that would explain the wheels . And what if this whole thing had just enough give to save his life ? - We 'd have to find him to ask . - Yeah , we 'd have to find him . Looks like maybe we found part of him already . [ Doorbell Buzzing ] I think you 're taking a flier here , Mulder . There 's gotta be at least 600 people with prosthetic eyes in the greater Chicago area . But only this one Henry Weems made an appointment this morning to get a new one . Maybe he can 't see his way to the door . [ Door Opens ] Come on , Scully . I 'm feeling lucky . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Door Opens ] Can you help me ? It 's an emergency . [ Water Spraying ] - Ma 'am , we 're not plumbers . - I didn 't say you were . I just want the damn water turned off so I can go to work . You gotta be stronger than me , right ? Valve 's under the sink . Your building super Henry Weems , he isn 't around ? Mr. Dependable ? Might as well wait forJimmy Hoffa to show up . You 're turning it the wrong way . - Hey , Richie , sweetheart , back in bed . - But , Mom ... Butts are for sitting , and I want yours back in bed . He 's right . Clockwise . I know that . Clockwise . [ Floorboards Creaking ] You okay , Mulder ? Yeah , it 's all right . My ass broke the fall . Guess who I found . Henry Weems , I presume ? Next time leave the plumbing to a professional . Oh , uh ... Oh , uh , you wanna try this on for size , Cinderella ? Mr. Weems , why were you hiding in a vacant apartment ? Not hiding . Avoiding . - Avoiding whom ? - You people . Now that you found me , let 's just get it over with . No way am I testifying againstJimmy Catrona . Last night , Catrona had you thrown off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue . - Is that correct ? - You didn 't hear it from me . I 'm not letting you people move me to Muncie , Indiana to milk cows . More to the point , you survived a 300-foot fall , - essentially unharmed . - [ Flesh Squishing ] I don 't know . Maybe the wind was just right . And I landed on a bunch of towels . No biggie . - You got lucky ? - Yeah , I guess . Except you should look at my bruise . [ Moans ] Plus , I didn 't get to keep my poker winnings . So , that 's what you were doing there last night , playing poker ? Catrona thought I was cheating . I wasn 't . But like I said , you didn 't hear it from me . Must 've been a high-stakes game , I imagine . Did you win a lot of money ? I don 't know . A little . [ Mulder ] What is that ? Did you make it ? Uh-huh . - It 's sort of a hobby . - Mm-hmm . Mind if I ... - Ah . That 's craftsmanship . - Wow . - What does it mean ? - What do you mean what does it mean ? - What 's ... - It doesn 't mean anything . I just sort of ... I don 't know . It 's cause and effect . - So , are ... are we done here ? - [ Scully ] Mr. Weems ? Can I ask you to reconsider testifying against Catrona ? - Nope . No way , Jose . - It would be in your best interest . He 's tried to kill you once , and he will undoubtedly do it again . - Yeah , we can protect you . - I 'll take my chances . So , here 's the plan as I see it . We inform the Chicago field office about Weems , leaving it to them to secure his testimony . You change your clothes , we fly back to D.C. By sunset and all is right with the world . Come on , Scully . Are you gonna dump this case just as it 's getting interesting ? Interesting , Mulder , was when we were looking for Wile E. Coyote . Come on , Mulder . This guy just got lucky . There 's no X-File here . Maybe his luck is the X-File . Stairs . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Oh . Car keys . Must have lost ' em when I fell . - [ Doorbell Buzzing ] - [ Gunshot ] [ Gasps ] So , you get many of these ? Okay . So , uh , they searched the entire building , and there 's no sign of Henry Weems . I 'm guessing that he 's on the run . Our dead man 's name is Angelo Bellini , a.k.a. , Angie the Animal . He 's an enforcer for the Catrona family . And I don 't think his visit was friendly . You think that Weems could have killed him in self-defense ? A skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nicknamed the Animal ? I don 't think so . You and I both know Weems didn 't kill anybody . Besides , we were gone for two minutes . This guy doesn 't have a scratch on him . I 'm thinking it was a heart attack . What the hell happened here , Mulder ? Cause and effect . - Meaning ? - Okay , so watch . So Bellini kicks down the door . [ Karate Grunt ] Poised to kill Weems , right ? But just as he 's about to pull the trigger , a noise startles him . The buzzer when I buzzed to be let back in the apartment . So when he does pull the trigger , his aim is off . Right ? And he hits the lamp ... which falls over and knocks over the ironing board . So as the bullet ricochets , Weems dives over the sofa . Now when Bellini goes for him , he trips over the ironing board , bounces off the chair , flips end-over-end ... and his shoelace gets caught in the fan ... Q.E.D. Cause and effect . Seemingly unrelated and unconnected events and occurrences ... that appear unrelated and random beforehand , but which seem to chain-react in Henry Weems ' favor . - Dumb luck ? - Yeah . He seems to have tapped into it somehow . He won big at poker , he survived getting thrown off a skyscraper , and now this . - Hang on a second . - Okay . Hey , your name 's Richie , right ? - Yeah . - I 'm Dana . - Hi . - Why don 't we , uh , head back to your room . I 'm sure that 's what your mom would want . So , I 'm guessing you 're a sports fan . Which one 's your favorite ? Well , it used to be basketball , but now the Bulls suck , so I think maybe baseball . I like baseball too . Did Henry make this for you ? [ Bell Ringing ] [ Chuckles ] - That 's pretty neat . - Yeah . He made it for me when I was in the hospital . He said it 's ' cause everything happens for a reason . Only just sometimes it 's hard for us to see . You went to the hospital because of your liver ? It doesn 't work so good . - Police looking for Henry ? - Yeah . They just wanna talk to him . Do you have any idea where he might have gone ? Mm-mm . Since I got sick , he hardly ever goes out . - The boy give you any leads ? - He knows nothing . - Mulder , as to your theory , - Mm-hmm ? Why would the world 's most supernaturally lucky man ... work as a building superintendent ? I mean , why doesn 't he just run down to the Illinois State Lottery , enter and , you know , he 'd win automatically ? [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Footsteps ] [ Chuckles ] How you feelin ' , pal ? I 'm okay . The police are lookin for you , though . How come ? Uh , you know . You do folks a favor , wire their joint for free cable ... Don 't worry about it . You gonna be okay by yourself for a while ? Where you goin ' ? Somethin ' I gotta do I 've been puttin ' off . You get some rest . That 's it ? You 've got nothing else ? Okay , thank you . Henry Weems has no police record , I assume . He has no record of any kind , Mulder . He doesn 't earn enough in a year to file tax returns . He has no savings account , no checking account , no insurance . Doesn 't even have a video rental card for that matter . Doesn 't even have a driver 's license . I mean , it 's like he 's intentionally stayed off the radar . He 's retired from the world . Ever since December 1989 . That 's when a commuter jet crashed into Lake Michigan ... carrying 21 passengers . - There was one survivor . - Henry . Yeah . That 's how he lost his eye . Snowy night , Christmas rush . He 'd been bumped from three flights ... before they finally found a seat for him on that fateful plane . - Guess what seat number . - Thirteen ? - Of flight seven . - More good luck you 're saying ? Call it good or bad , but maybe that 's where it all started . What if a brand-new Henry Weems was plucked from the wreckage ... one whose fortunes had been irrevocably permanently changed ? Before 1989 , Henry held down a job for nine years at a train yard . But after the accident , as you said , it 's like he disappeared off the face of the earth . He severed ties with all his friends and moved out to Melrose Park . Mulder , there are millions of reasons for that , including survivor 's guilt . What doesn 't track for me is why Henry Weems would drop off the map ... just because he suddenly became incredibly lucky . What doesn 't track for me is why he 's resurfaced after all these years . Why he suddenly decided to use his luck in this way . - [ Man ] All right , take care of yourself , brother . - Later . Hey , what 's the , uh , lottery up to ? - Twenty-eight million . - I don 't need that much . You don 't need that much ? How much do you need , uh , Rockefeller ? More like a hundred grand . Here goes . One dollar . [ Cash Register Ringing ] [ Scoffs ] These suck . [ Man On TV ] More on this morning 's Melrose Park shooting . Let 's go live to the scene with Megan MacLean . Police have confirmed that a Melrose Park building superintendent ... is wanted for questioning in a case some sources term ... an unusually vicious gangland slaying . You did it ! You won a hundred grand ! - Where do I collect the money ? - Man , they 'll mail it to ya . Eighty-two hundred dollars a month for twelve months . Yeah ! That 's too long . No , please , I wouldn 't do that . Oh , baby ! Oh , sweet baby ! Anything in the trash can is the store 's property . - Yeah , right . In your face ! - Please , no , just throw it away . Something bad is gonna happen . So long , suckers . [ Laughing ] I did it ! I won ! I won the lottery ! A hundred grand , fools ! A hundred grand ! On three . One , two , three . So , let me get this straight . - This is the man who initially won the money ? - Mm-hmm . And once you and he ascertained that the accident victim was still alive , this man fled on foot ? - Mm-hmm . - Okay . After which , the man who was hit by the truck ... handed you the lottery card and said ... " Maurice , I want you to have this . " Mm-hmm . Thank you , Mr. Albert . I think that will be all . Thank you . For such a fortunate man , a lot of unfortunate things happen in Henry Weems ' wake . Maybe that 's part of the package . You can 't have one without the other . So , Mulder , Henry Weems came here to buy a lottery ticket . Why ? Maybe it 's like you said : " Why wouldn 't the luckiest man in the world enter the lottery ? " Actually , that 's exactly what you said ... about an hour after you said it . [ Sighs ] Well , he 's not in his place and he 's not with Richie . You think he hid in there ? He doesn 't hide . He avoids . Well , pretty damn well , I 'd say . That thing must go all over the building , Mulder . I 'll start with the roof if you wanna start with the basement . [ Doorknob Rattling ] Hey ! Hey ! Watch the rough stuff ! - Henry Weems , you 're a hard man to track down . - I 'm workin ' here ! Oh ? You and I are gonna have a talk . - You just sit right here and don 't move , okay ? - Tough guy . [ Floorboards Creaking ] Oh , crap . Not again . - [ Groans ] - [ Grunts ] [ Woman ] Let 's get him up to O.R. Coming through . Excuse us . Does it hurt ? Stings a bit . But I 'll live . Come over here , Henry . I wanna try something . - What 's that about ? - I haven 't a clue . Nine of clubs . You go . - What for ? - I think you know . Oh , you win . Double or nothing . [ Cards Shuffling ] Ooo-hoo ! Tough to beat . - You win again ! - Mulder , what does that prove ? I think it proves if we played this 10,000 times in a row , he would win 10,000 times in a row . He 's incapable of losing . How does it feel to be the luckiest man in the universe , Henry ? It 's a nightmare . You have no idea . No , I do . 'Cause when you get lucky ... really , really lucky ... people around you tend to suffer , is that right ? I think it 's a balance thing . Something good happens to me , then everybody else has to take it in the keister . So you stayed close to home mostly , kept a low profile . But recently you 've been venturing out further . You played poker with mobsters . I figured they could stand the trimming . Bunch of goombah jerks . They got issues , man . You don 't mind so much if a few criminals get hurt , but then you went and you played the lottery . - I don 't ... - I knew I shouldn 't have done that . - I needed the money . - For what ? For Richie , right ? It 's the complications from his hepatitis . He 's on every donor list they got , but ... he 's got a rare blood type ... " B " negative . And he 's ... C.N. Something . C.M.V. Negative ... Cytomegalovirus . There 's no way they 're gonna find a donor in time . There 's a treatment program in England . Hundred grand gets him in . It 's experimental , but ... it 's the best chance he 's got now . - Am I under arrest ? - No . However , you will need protection from Catrona and his men . I 'd say they need protection from me . I 'm sorry , Mulder . That was utterly irresponsible . You 're feeding the delusions of a man who had three attempts made upon his life . You 're supposed to be talking him into protective custody , not out of it . I 'd agree with you if I thought his life was in danger . As it is , he 's doing a betterjob on Catrona 's organization than the F.B.I. I 'm wondering if we shouldn 't make him an honorary agent . [ Scully ] Mulder , you 're putting an astounding amount of faith ... in coincidence and luck . Essentially , you 're betting a man 's life on it . And even if you believe in so-called lucky streaks , you have to know they all eventually end . [ Chuckles ] Luckiest man in the world ? Well , Mulder , I just beat him . - Mulder ? - Come on , Scully . Henry ! - [ Body Thuds ] - [ People Chattering ] - You 're supposed to be resting . - I am resting . Playing on the floor doesn 't count . Don 't you ever get tired of this thing ? Henry said it 's educational . Yeah , well , I don 't want you believing everything that Henry says . Did you know the police are looking for him ? - Henry said it 's no big deal . - When did you see ... Mom , what 's wrong ? How 's he doin ' ? He 's got a bruised rib and a black eye . It certainly could have been worse . And don 't tell me he just got lucky . Far from it . Maybe what you said about streaks is right . Looks like his has just about run its course . I don 't mean to make light of his misfortune , but it may have knocked some sense into his head . He 's agreed to testify against Catrona . - What ? - Our guy from theJustice Department just called . They 're filing a federal warrant this afternoon . - This mook Weems ... - This mook Weems was street pizza last I heard from you . He was . I don 't know what it is . Maybe he has some special ability . He 's impervious or something . Anyway , we can 't get to him . They got cops all over the hospital . Who says we have to get to him ? I want the toy Henry made me , Mom . Can you please go get it ? Uh , sure , honey . - We gotta go . - Richie , I will bring it and I will follow you there . I will meet you at the hospital , okay ? [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Did you find her ? - No . You know Catrona took her . He did it to keep me from testifying . And he 's who we 're focused on . But there 's no sign of a kidnapping , no ransom note . - He 's too smart for that . - It makes it very hard for us to obtain a search warrant . - We 'll get one , though . - When ? Tomorrow ? Next week ? Could someone sit with him at least ? Hold up , Henry . What if what I said before wasn 't true ? That your luck hasn 't changed ? Maybe all this is happening for a reason . So you 're saying that Maggie getting taken is a good thing ? No , I 'm saying that what looks like it might be bad luck may not be bad luck . That we can 't tell yet . We 're not in that position . We can 't see the forest for the trees . How is he ? Not good . If we don 't find a donor in the next few hours ... Scully , what if everybody that becomes involved in Henry Weems ' life ... somehow becomes an integral part of his luck , including you and I ? Mulder , you 're speaking as if we 're all trapped ... in one of those contraptions that he built . - What are you doing ? - Looking for Maggie Lupone . Luck is the overreaching force in this investigation . I say we roll with it . - Yeah . Let 's call that a dry run . - Yeah . [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Look who came calling . I wanted to tell you personally that there 's no hard feelings . I 'm not testifying against you . Just let Maggie Lupone go . Maggie ? I don 't know anybody named Maggie . You know anybody named Maggie ? [ Laughing ] Fellas , don 't jerk me around . Jerk you around ? You tried to cheat me out of a hundred large , you kill Angie , you put Sal in the hospital . I 'm jerkin ' you around ? I apologize for my choice of words . Please , just let her go . Her kid 's really sick . I don 't care what happens to me . You 'll care . By the time I 'm finished , you 'll definitely care . Henry ? Richie , how is he ? Not that one . Use the small one . Hey ! Henry ? [ Groaning ] Don 't you hurt him , you son of a bitch ! Shut her up ! [ Grunting ] [ Maggie ] Henry ! [ Gasps ] Oh ! [ Man ] Check downstairs ! [ Mulder ] What are the odds for Catrona being a perfect match ? - A thousand to one ? A million to one ? - Maybe higher . Maybe everything does happen for a reason . Whether we see it or not . Maybe your luck is changing . Maybe . [ Bell Ringing ] [ Child ] I made this !

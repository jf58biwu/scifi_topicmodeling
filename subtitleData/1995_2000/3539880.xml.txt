 Come , come ! Please ! Aziz . Light ! - Aziz light ! Good . We start again . " When the 3 planets are in eclipse the black hole , like Aziz door , is open . Evil comes spreading terror and chaos . " See the snake , Billy ? The ultimate evil . Make sure you get the snake . - Yes . I 've got the snakes . I got all the snakes . When is the snake act going to occur ? If this is the five and this is the one ... Every 5.000 years . So . I 've got some time , then . You bring them water . Good boy . I will take it to them . Go with God . Be safe from evil . You see here these different peoples or symbols of people gathering the 4 elements of life . Water , fire , earth , air around Aziz 5th one . A fifth element . Forgive me , Lord . They already know too much . Father . How are you ? - Well . Have some glasses ? Of course . - It 's the most extraordinary thing . It 's the greatest find in history . - You must be parched . Oh , yes , yes . I 'm sorry . It 's like a battle plan . Here the good here the evil . And here , a weapon against evil . I 'll be famous . - Then let us toast to your fame . - To fame . Salute ! You can 't toast with water . Billy , in my sack , the grappa . This I don 't understand . This could be something prehistoric . I don 't know . But , wait . Here ... Look , look ! They 're here . This man this perfect being ... I know this is the key . This divine light they talk about ... What is divine light ? Aziz , light ! Much better . Thank you . My Lord . This is the most unbelievable thing I 've ever seen . Don 't you think ? Are you German ? Lord , he was about to discover everything . But no worry . I was there in time . - Priest , you and those before you have served us well . But war is coming . Stones not safe on Earth anymore . This is really amazing . The 5th element . - Take the stones . My Lord if you take the weapon we 'll be defenseless when evil returns . In 300 years when Evil returns , so shall we . Oh , Professor ! Professor ! Don 't move ! Billy ! - I have a gun ! Please understand they 're our friends . - Friends ? Father they killed the Professor ! I can explain everything . - You 're with them ? Look at me . I am your friend . - No . Father . Look at me !

Time is not important . Only life is important . I will fulfill my mission ! You can count on me ! I will pass the knowledge until you return . Anything yet ? - No , Sir . Not even a temperature ? - The analyzers jammed . One shows 1 - million degrees , others minus 5.000 . - Let 's see it . It 's taking shape . Send out a probe . Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the Federated Territories . On air with Generals Staedert in 30 seconds . I saved this seat for you , Father . President on the line . - We 're in position . I must address the Supreme Council . Just the facts . There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet . We 're doing thermo-nucleatic imaging . - So , you don 't know what this is . All we know is it 's getting bigger . - Recommendation ? My philosophy is to shoot first and ask later . The uninvited guests . All right , then . - Mr . President ? Yes ? - Priest Vito Cornelius . I have a different theory . You have 20 seconds . Imagine that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be . Where ever there is life it brings death because it 's evil . Absolute evil . - One more reason to shoot . Evil begets evil , Mr. President . Shooting will only make it stronger . Probe will be there in 5 seconds . Growth rate is at 27 % . - Your theory is interesting but we don 't have time to go into it . - Time is of no importance . Only life is important . - You 're right . That 's what we 'll do , protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens . Fire when ready ! - Load a 120 - ZR missile . Marker lights on the objective . Structure solidified on the surface . - I think it 's anticipating the attack . It must be intelligent ! - The most terrible intelligence imaginable . 120 ' she loaded . The ship is in combat formation . Missiles are loaded . Staedert ! I have a doubt . - I don 't , Mr. President . What happened ? Can you hear me ? What happened ? Did you destroy it ? - I 'm about to . Planet has increased in by 200 % - It 's moving toward the ship . Do we have that 's bigger than 240 ? - Nothing , sir . Staedert , do you hear me ? Get out of there . I don 't want an incident . Do you hear me ? Get out of there . Do you hear me , Staedert ? Do you understand ? Listen I am President . That 's an order ! Don 't you understand me ? Don 't you hear me ? Get out of there ! Good God ! I try . To quit is my goal . I 'm up . All right , I 'm up . God . - Finger here . Hi , sweetie ! - You too , Major . Nice said . I was talking to the cat . - You prefer your cat to the real thing . - At least the cat comes back . Still pining for that two - timing slut ? There 's millions . I don 't want a million . I just want one . The perfect one . - It don 't exist , Major . Yeah , I know . - What ? Picture of you . - How do I look ? Like shit . - Must be an old picture . Bring me your hack for the 6 month overhaul . - Negative . I don 't need one . You forget who sat next to you for 1 .000 missions ? I know how you drive . I drive a cab now not a space fighter . Tell me , how many points you got left on your license ? How many points ? - At least 50 . You need to learn how to lie . See you tonight . Welcome to Paradise . - Welcome to FHLOSTON PARADISE . It 's Ruby Rhod . I 'll tell you live at 5 the winner of the Super Dream Gemini Croquette Contest ! The winner will got with me for 2 days to FHLOSTON PARADISE . Tune ... - Don 't watch all day .

You have 5 points left your license . - Yeah , thank you for reminding me . Have a nice day . - Why not ? You have 48 hours . The time it needs to adapt itself to our conditions . And then ? - Then it will be too late . The goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power but to exterminate life . All forms of life . You 're telling me there 's nothing that can stop this . There is only one thing . The Mondoshawan have in their possession the weapon to defeat evil . 4 elements gathered around a fifth supreme being , the ultimate warrior created to protect life . Together they produced the " The Light of Creation " . Able to bring life to the furthest reaches of the universe . But if evil stands there ... Then what ? - Then light turns to dark life to death forever . A Mondoshawan spaceship Requests permission to enter our territory . - Give it permission to enter with our warmest regards . - Thank you . Permission to enter granted . Showtime . We are lost . Aknot , we are connected to Earth . Mr. Zorg 's office . - It 's Aknot . I 'm so glad to hear you , Aknot . The mission is accomplished . You 'll have what you want in a few hours . Good .

Go get some rest . - No . The Mondoshawan ... I am their contact . They will come for me . This is government business . I 'll keep you informed . Rescue team reported from the crash . - And survivors ? Only one . You call that a survivor ? - All I need is a few live cells . Have you identified it ? - We tried . Normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups which is enough for any species to perpetuate . This has 200.000 memo groups . Sounds like a freak of nature . - Yeah , can 't wait to meet him . You ok ? Over here . Excuse me . General , I want to show you something . This is a normal human DNA chain . You , me , anybody , right ? Watch this . The compositional elements of this DNA chain are like ours . But there 's more of them , with infinite genetic knowledge . Almost like this being was engineered . Is there any danger ? - We put it through the cellular hygiene detector . The cell is perfect . Go ahead ! Mr. Perfect better be polite . Otherwise turn him into cat food . - Activate it . Tissue processing . 10 seconds to ultraviolet protection . This is the last phase . The cells are bombarded by atoms which forces the body to react . That means growing skin . Wonderful . Reconstruction complete . Remove the shield . I told you . Perfect . Thermal bandages . I 'd like to take some pictures for the archives . What 'd she say ? - Don 't know . Activate the detector . Is that thin solid ? - Unbreakable . Good . If you want out you must learn to develop those communication skills . General alert . Perfect . Ladder on 18 . 2 men with me , the rest in the ventilation . This way ! Lady , stay calm ! This is the police . There 's nowhere else to go . So you will turn around and put your hands on the floor . Do you understand ? She doesn 't . We need a flying unit . This is the police ! This is the police ! We are processing your identification ! Put your arms up and follow our instructions .

Open the passenger door ! Yeah , yeah , sure ! Why not ? Thank you for your cooperation . Help ! - Finger 's going to kill me . Emergency ! Emergency ! 1 point has been removed . - Yes , I know ! This is so stupid . - Assist in pursuit of yellow cab ! - Unit 47 , we 're on the way after we finish lunch . Two golden menues . I 'm too old , too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hotrod . Thank you so much . And I 'm definitely too thirsty . Wow ! Maybe we got lucky . If they don 't chase you after a mile , you 're safe . Maybe it 's 2 miles . Hang on . Look , lady , I only speak English and bad English ! Run an I . D. I 'm all for conversation , but maybe you can just shut up for a minute ! He 's got a scan blocker . - Means he 's a car thief . Blast him . I don 't know what you did but they are pissed off ! Hold on ! We 're safe for a while . You don 't want to play it soft , you want to play it hard . Let 's play hard . If we get to the fog , we 'll be ok . If we get to the fog . How do they expect us to find anything in this shit ? We 're just going too wait here until things quiet down . Shit ! You ok ? Priest ... - You don 't need a priest , just a doctor . - Vito Cornelius . What ? - Priest . Yes ? - I 'm looking for a priest . The weddings are one floor down . Congratulations . She 's not my bride . She 's looking for Vito Cornelius . The phone book said he lived here . - That 's me , but don 't know who she is . Nobody does . No file , no I . D. , nothing . She 's got a tattoo on this arm . - Tattoo ? Fifth element . Finger 's going to kill me . Wake up . Who are you ? - I brought the girl , remember ? She just dropped on me . Started speaking a bizarre language . It 's not bizarre . It 's the divine language . Ok ! - It 's the ancient language spoken throughout the universe . He 's a she . You noticed that . - Yes . It 's a miracle . - Miracle she 's not dead . Wake her up . But gently , because this woman is mankind 's most precious possession . She is perfect . Perfect . More dignified . - Hey , lady , wake up . I shouldn 't've done that . I was wrong to kiss you . He said to wake you gently . You 're right ? Just thought you might remember me from the cab .

Ask her for my gun back . - What 's your name ? Korben Dallas . - Thank you for your help . You 've been kind , but now the girl needs to rest . She 's been on a long trip . - I know . I was there when she landed . Wait ! Wait , Father . She said something I didn 't understand . What does ekto gamat mean ? " Never without my permission . " - That 's what I thought . I shouldn 't have kissed her . Oh , no . I 'm so sorry . I forgot your food . How about some nice Thai food ? Yeah , yeah , hold on . What ? - Buddy , I 'm waiting all day here . Finger ! - Where 's the cab ? Car 's running fine . - Fine . What fine ? I know you . Fine ain 't in your vocabulary . You can tell your old buddy what happened . What , you save the planet ? You dinged the fender again . - Finger ! I was on my way to see you and a fare fell in my lap . One of these big fares you can 't resist . - How big ? Five - nine , blue eyes , long legs , great skin . You know ? Perfect . I see . And this perfect fare , he got a name ? Leeloo . What 's she doing ? - Learning our history , the last 5.000 years that she missed . She 's been asleep for awhile . I know she 's been through a lot , but we don 't have much time . You 're right . - Chicken . Good . Chicken . I 'm really sorry to interrupt you , but the case with the stones , where is it ? Stolen ? Who in God 's name would do such a thing ? Excuse me , sir . The council is worried about the economy . Is it possible to fire 500.000 ? I thought from a smaller company , like one of the cab companies . - Fire 1 million . But 500.000 ... 1 million ! Fine , sir . Sorry to have disturbed you . It 's for the Supreme ... Sorry . I didn 't know your size and I found this make - up . You just put it like that ... Thank you . - Yes , there was a man with a limp came here a month ago asking about the stones . Said he was an art dealer . What was his name ? I 'm bad with names . They really made her ... - Perfect . I know . What 'd she say ? - She says she knows where they are . My dear Aknot , how about those 2 planes you borrowed ? Aknot , is that you ? What an ugly face . It doesn 't suit you . Take it off . That 's better . Never be ashamed of who you are . You 're warriors . Be proud . So what if the federal government scattered you to the wind . What doesn 't kill makes you stronger . Your time for revenge is at hand . The ZF-1 . It 's light . The handle 's adjustable for easy carrying . Breaks down into 4 parts , undetectable by X-ray . A word on fire power : Titanium recharger . 3.000 round clip , with bursts of 300 . With the replay button , a Zorg invention , it 's even easier . One shot and replay sends every following shot to the same location . And to finish the job , all the Zorg oldies but goldies . Rocket launcher . Arrow launcher with exploding or poison heads . Very practical . Net launcher . The flame thrower . My favorite . And for the grand finale the new Ice Cube System . 4 full crates delivered on time . And what about you , dear Aknot ? Did you bring what I asked ? Yes . Magnificent . Listen this case is empty . Empty ? - Empty the opposite of full . This case is supposed to be full ! Anyone care to explain ? The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust . We took another route . She 's supposed to contact this person in a hotel . And she 's looking for the address . Easy . - Dot . It 's Planet FHLOSTON , in the Angel Constellation . We 're saved . - I 'm screwed . You asked for a case . We brought one . - A case with 4 stones in it ! Not 1 , or 2 , or 3 , but 4 ! 4 stones ! But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case ? - We are warriors , not merchants . But you can still count ! It 's easy . Look at my fingers . 4 stones . 4 crates . Zero stones , zero crates ! Pack everything up ! We risked our lives . I believe a little compensation is in order . So you are merchants after all . Leave him one crate for the cause . I don 't like warriors . Too narrow - minded , and worse , they fight for hopeless causes : Honor . Honor 's killed millions , hasn 't saved anyone . I 'll tell you what I do like : A killer . A dyed - in - the - wool killer , cold - blooded , clean and methodical . A real killer picking up the ZF - 1 would 've asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun . Bring me the priest . I got everything we need to know about FHLOSTON PARADISE and the hotel . Good work . Now all we must do is find a way to get there . It 's difficult . There 's a charity ball tomorrow . Flights are full and , with celebrities , hotel will be guarded . - There must be a way . I 'll get it . Weddings ? No . Mr. Zorg would like talk to you . - Who ? Mr. Zorg . - Jean Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg . It 's nice to see you again . - I remember you now . The so - called art dealer . - I 'm glad you got your memory back . Because you 'll need it . Where are the stones ? - I don 't know . If I did , I wouldn 't tell someone like you . - Why ? What 's wrong with me ? - I try to save life . But you only want to destroy it . Father , you 're so wrong . Let me explain . Life , which you so nobly serve , comes from destruction and chaos . Take this empty glass here it is , peaceful boring . But if it is destroyed ... Look at all these little things . So busy now . Notice how each is useful . What a lovely ballet ensues so full of form and color . Now think of all those people that created them . Technicians , engineers , people who can feed their children tonight so those children can grow up and have children ... and so on . Thus adding to the great chain of life . Water . - You see , Father , by creating a little destruction I 'm encouraging life . In reality we 're in the same business . Cheers . Where 's the robot to pat you on the back ? Or the engineer ? Or their children , maybe ? There , you see how all your so - called power counts for nothing ? How your entire empire of destruction comes crashing down all because of one little cherry . You saved my life and in return I 'll spare yours for now . - You 're a monster , Zorg . I know . Talk to the President , I don 't care just bring me the stone . You have one hour . It 's gobbling up all the satellites - Why is it eating up all the satellites ? - We 're working on it . The Mondoshawan deplore the incident , but accept our apologies . And the stones ? Did you find them ? - They weren 't on board . What ? - They never fully trusted the us . They gave the stones to someone . Her name is Plavalaguna . She 's a diva . She 's singing at a charity ball in a few hours . She has the stones . The Mondoshawan will help . We must send someone to get the stones . Excellent . I want this operation to be as discreet as possible . No troops . I want your best man to go undercover . I have the perfect one . Message . - Yes . Not opening it ? Could be important . Like the last 2 I got were important . First one was form my wife telling me she 's leaving . The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife . - That is bad luck . Grandfather say : " It never rain everyday . " This is good news , guarantee . Bet your lunch . Ok . Come on . " You are fired . " Oh , I 'm sorry . At least I won lunch . Good philosophy . See good in bad . I like . Hello ! - You got broken fingers ? You can 't punch my number ? - Hi , Mom . 17 messages . Don 't say your machine is broken again . The last 1 .000 years . Go . This 'll take a minute . Good fortune for you . It bring you good luck ! Take me on this trip . - What 're you talking about ? You want to make me beg ? - No , all I want is an explanation . I just got in . I smashed my cab . I lost my job . I got mugged . Besides that , everything 's peachy . Thanks for asking . Now settle down and explain this to me . - You don 't know you won a trip to FHLOSTON PARADISE for two for 10 days . I suppose you 'll just leave me on the lunar surface . If I 'd won a trip , I 'd know . I would 've been notified . They 've been blaring your name out on the radio for an hour . I 'll call you back . General , how nice to see you in the 5.000 block . Nice apartment . You 've settled into a wonderful life . Heard you lost your job . - You heard that ? Don 't worry . I 'll get another job . - Don 't bother . We have one for you . Major Dallas , you 're selected for a mission . What mission ? - To save the world . YOU leave for FHLOSTON PARADISE . Get 4 stones from the diva Plavalaguna and bring them back . Any questions ? - Why me ? I retired 6 months ago . - Three reasons . One : As a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft . Two : you 're the most highly decorated . - The third ? Of all the members of your unit , you 're the only one left alive . Check your messages ? - I 've had enough good news . Might be important . You 've won the Gemini Contest and a trip to FHLOSTON PARADISE for 2 . Here are your tickets . You rigged the contest ? - Congratulations ! You couldn 't be more discreet ? - Old tricks are the best tricks . Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife . I am not going . Why not ? Excuse me , General . Who is it ? My wife . - You remarried ? No . But I 'm going to marry her . I love her . But she hates the military . She knows the military ruined my last marriage . If she sees you , she 'll kill me . Hide somewhere . You must help me . - We 'd love to , but where can we hide ? We don 't have time for this . - It 's just for one minute . Please . How much you 're helping me , you have no idea . I 'll be happily married . - The 3 of us , won 't fit in here . Sure you will . - Major ! You 're on my foot . I 'm really sorry . Mr. Wallace ... - Dallas . We heard about your good luck and need your tickets for FHLOSTON . Is this how priests vacation ? - We 're on a mission . What kind ? - We must save the world . You , save the world ? - Yes !

This is not an exercise ! Spread your legs and place your hands in the yellow circles . - What 're you doing ? Saving you . - But I ... I think this is the door . Let 's see it . Are you classified as human ? - Negative . I am a meat Popsicle . I found him . - Mr . Korben Dallas can you put your hands in the yellow circles , please ? Smoke you ! - Wrong answer . The police control is now terminated . Thank you for your cooperation . Have a nice day . - We got the guy . Wasn 't easy , but we bagged him . Thanks for the tip . - Glad to be of help . The guy 's been arrested for uranium smuggling . All I have to do know is go to the airport , take his place and I 'll be in FHLOSTON in 4 hours . - Don 't come back without the stones ! We got Korben Dallas . - Perfect . Akanit , take command . Go to FHLOSTON and get the stones . If Zorg really wants them he 'll have to negotiate . Revenge is at hand . Oh . I am so sorry . I forgot about the autowash . There 's an autowash in the shower . I 'm so sorry . - Wash . Autowash , yes . Autowash , in the shower . It 's funny , I 've met you twice today . Both times you 've ended up in my arms . It 's my lucky day . Lucky day . Did you hear something ? - Cornelius . Autowash . - I 'm so sorry . I don 't need your help . Want a cup of coffee ? - Yes , please . Coffee 's not my specialty . But you must drink a lot of coffee , being a priest . I know ! I 'm not proud of what I did ! I had no choice ! I 'll take the mission . Did you get them ? - Yes . Leeloo Dallas . - Multi-pass . Korben David Dallas . Perfect . I can 't be your husband . I 'm too old . Now David is in great shape . Now .

See you later for a new adventure . End of transmission . That 's the best show I ever did . Major Dallas has the five elements On board and the priest is guiding them to the temple . We 're saved !

A ball of fire 1 .200 miles in diameter is heading toward Earth and we have no idea how to stop it . That 's the problem . How much time do we have ? - If its speed remains constant , in 1 hour and 57 minutes ... - I 'll call you back in 2 hours . Hello ? They landed in the desert . Good job , David . Put her in the center . - Where ? Here ? You got it figured out ? - This one should be fire . You know how this works ? - Theoretically . The 4 stones should go around the Fifth Element 's in the middle and then the weapon should work . - You 've never seen this work ? No ! - Give me that . Every weapon has a manual . I 'm sure this has one too . That 's it . That 's it . - Match up the symbols . Go ! Go ! Wind . My man , what 're you doing ? - What ? What 're you doing ? - Trying to keep you a DJ . Fire . Done . - Now what ? So now we have to open them . - You know how to do that ? Theoretically ? - No . Leeloo , honey , wake up . You must help us . How do you open the stones ? Wind blows . Fire burns . Yes , I know all that . But how do you open these stones ? Rain falls . What does it mean ? - I think that ... Maybe it 's a charade . A game or something . If we don 't get them open , we 'll die . Yes , die . Too late . We 've lost contact with them . - 3 minutes . I think mine is broken . Why must I get the broke one ? We 'll never make it . It moved . Show me what you did . - Nothing . Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Calm down . Show me what you did . I was standing here . And I put my hands on the top like this , and I said : We 're not going to make it . And that 's it ? Korben , my man . Wind . She said wind blows . Everyone take a stone . Water for water . Fire for fire . Earth for Earth . Go ! Earth . Open the other one . Korben , my man , I have no fire . I have not matches . Do you have any ? I stopped smoking . Father , you smoke ? Got some matches ? We need some fire . We 're going to die . Don 't breathe . Fire . - 1 minute . Let 's go . Leeloo . Wake up ! Wake up ! It 's time for you to work now . Protect life until death . Listen to me ! Listen to me ! Listen , I know you 're very tired . I 'll take you on vacation when we 're done . But if you don 't do something right now we 'll all die . What 's the use of saving live when you see what you do with it ? It 'll enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds . You 're right , you 're right . There are some things beautiful things worth saving . Beautiful things . Like love ? - Yes , love . That 's good . That 's a good example . Love is worth saving . I don 't know love . I don 't know it . I was built to protect , not love . So there 's no use for me , other than this . - You 're wrong . You 're wrong . You 're wrong . I need you . I need you very much . Why ? Because ... Because ... Tell her , Korben ! Tell me , please , why you need me ? - Because ... Tell me . Tell me . Because I love you . I love you . 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ! Scanner imaging has confirmed the dark planet dead .

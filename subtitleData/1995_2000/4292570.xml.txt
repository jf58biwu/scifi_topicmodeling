 Gosh , go home , Harold . I 'm not done yet . - Harold , you hear me ? You should 've gone home already . - I 'm not done yet . For cryin ' out loud . This ain 't so difficult . I 'm not done yet ! Harold , it 's past your bedtime . It 's okay . And the doctors will be worried about you . You did a good job today . Now you go home . Come on . [ Harold Mumbling ] Thirty-seven , forty-five , sixty-three , seventy-one , eighty-six , ninety-two . [ Clanking Sound ] What the hell ? [ Man ] Geez ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh ! I 'll get help ! Oh ! [ Siren Wails ] [ Siren Wailing ] Officer ! Officer ! Go on , sir . This don 't involve you . There 's a woman inside . She 's bleeding . She 's- - My God . That 's her ! That 's the girl I saw . [ Screams ] Hey , Scully ! Take a look at this . What am I looking at ? The pin setter . See the way it 's wedged and broken ? [ Scully ] Yeah . Mr. Pintero said that would only happen if considerable weight was placed on it from above . - This is where you saw the body ? - Yes , ma 'am . She was caught up in the machinery . Her neck was cut . And the blood from the victim was pooling where ? Right here . But both the body and the blood were gone when you returned ? Yeah ! But like , like I said , the woman in the parking lot- - Was the same woman that you saw caught up in the machinery ? That 's right . Look , I 'm not making this up . - No one 's suggesting that you are , Mr. Pintero . - I saw the look on her face . Can I ask you a favor ? Can I get a soda ? - A cola ? Something like that ? - Sure , yeah . What is that " look , " Scully ? I would 've thought that after four years , you 'd know exactly what that " Look " was . You don 't believe in ghosts ? You 're saying that what this man saw was the victim 's ghost ? Sounds more like a disembodied soul . Which is just another name for a ghost . Except according to Mr. Pintero , this one was trying to communicate . She was speaking to him as if she was trying to tell him something . - It sounds more like a death omen . - A death omen ? Yeah . It 's a spirit being that arrives as a harbinger of death . This is the third reported sighting in as many weeks . And as many murders . Each time the victim appearing near the crime scene trying to communicate , to say something . - Communicate what ? - I don 't know yet , but- - Thank you . If you hold on a second , I may have an answer for you . Hey ! What are you doin ' ? " She is me . " - What ? - Written onto the wax . " She is me . " Look at this . Three victims . All women . All approximately the same age , height , weight , hair and eye color . All attacked within the same six-block area of each other . Our F.B.I. profiling model ... suggests a white male , late 20s , early 30s . His victims were probably strangers to him . Symbols representing other women in his life . perhaps all women . - Hey , you , in the back ? Are we boring you ? - No , not at all . Because if you have nothing to contribute to this profile- - I do have something to add . I think that following the F.B.I. model in this case , will not only fail to turn up the killer , but will undoubtedly lead to more victims and more deaths . You want to tell us who you are and what you base that on ? I 'm Special Agent Mulder . This is Agent Scully . We 're from the F.B.I. We 're here following up a lead that seems to have been dropped . A statement made by the proprietor of the bowling alley- - The guy who claims he saw the victim . No , no , not the victim . Her apparition . What the Irish calla fetch . What is more commonly known as a wraith . Oh ! Okay . - Were there any written messages in any of these other cases ? - Written messages ? Do the words , " She is me " have any meaning to you ? You mean Penny Timmons' last words . Those were her dying words ? - According to a 911 call we received- - - Who made that call ? - A nut . - What do you mean ? There were no dying words . penny Timmons ' larynx was severed . She couldn 't cry for help even if there was help to cry for . - And no one followed up on this lead ? - No . - I 'll have someone get you the number and you can follow up . - I 'd appreciate that . People ? People ? Listen up now . I brought some folks who want to talk with you . Nurse Innes , could you gather the group ? All right , everyone , let 's go . You know the drill . Get your seats . Group seating . Go on in . Harold ? Come on . Harold . - Good morning , everybody . - Good morning , Mr. Alpert . I brought visitors today . They 're investigating a crime . It 's okay . They just want to ask you a few questions . Hi . I wanted to ask ... if anybody used the pay phone in the hallway on Friday night ? Because somebody called the police and reported a murder . [ Whispering ] Sloppy Joe night . That was Sloppy Joe night . Ooh ! That was me . I did it . I admit it . I did it . I 'm just a human being after all . Chuck , tell the truth . Nah . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean it . I lied . I lied , but I 'm just a human being . Has anyone used the pay phone ... to call the police ? Anybody recognize this woman ? [ Chuck ] That 's the lady that got murdered . - [ Man ] Yeah , she 's the one . - [ Woman # 1 ] I recognize her . [ Woman # 2 ] I know her . She was murdered . And does anybody recognize this man ? - Oh , yes . Yes , he did it . - He did it . - He 's the murderer . - He 's a very funnyman . - He smiles a lot . Uh- [ Mulder ] The quiet man in the back . - Harold puller . [ Mulder ] The only one who didn 't raise his hand . Yeah . - Has he ever been a problem ? - Harold ? No ! He has a tendency to get a little worked up . - Do you think I can talk to him ? - Yeah , sure . All right . I think I found something here , Mulder . In these photos taken by the forensics team , the third victim , her left hand , that band of pale skin ? - It looks like she wore a ring on that hand . - A wedding ring , yeah . Yeah , but she wasn 't married . - So what , he stole her ring ? - No , not at all . [ Mulder ] He switched it . And in all the other murders , he repeated the same ritual . Changing the ring on each of the victims . Nice catch , Scully . Any idea about the psychology at work ? There 's something called ego dystonia , a form of obsessive compulsive disorder , where a person has the persistence and inescapable impulses ... to change things , to organize , to reorganize . But it 's not ordinarily something that escalates to a murderous impulse . Not ordinarily , unless there was a more complex psychology at work ... like pronounced mental illness . - You really think that the killer is a patient here ? - I 'm not sure the killer is here . But the person that made that phone call is . I think his name is Harold Spuller . - Did he cop to making the call ? - No . He 's about to . I don 't know anything . I didn 't do anything . Leave me alone . You made that phone call , didn 't you , Harold ? No . Did you say the words , " She is me " ? No . Have you ever heard those words ? No ! Have you ever seen a ghost , Harold ? No . No . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No , no , no , no , no ! - Harold , down . - No , no , no , no , Please leave me alone . - Don 't , Harold . - Leave me alone ! No , no , no , no ! - No , no , no , no , no ! - Harold , listen to me . When you 're right , you 're right . Seventeen , thirty , thirty-seven , forty-five , fifty-three . Harold Spuller suffers from pervasive developmental disorder ... where they 're sometimes called atypical autism . He has spent his entire life in and out of facilities just like this one . He has been medicated , he has received shock therapy , and aside from his other disabilities , he has been diagnosed with severe ego dystonic obsessive compulsive disorder , which would explain the switching of the victims ' rings . - So why all of a sudden ? - You mean what made him snap ? I think his outburst clearly showed a frustrated impulse towards violence ... when he was put in a challenging situation . That out burst didn 't come until after I 'd asked him if he 'd ever seen a ghost . Mulder , the man is disturbed . You could see the pressure building in him from the moment the interview began . Yeah . Why are you now so unconvinced that Harold Spuller is the man we came looking for ? I 'm sure Harold Spuller 's the man that made that phone call . But what led us to him , it still remains unexplained . - " She is me " ? - Mm-hmm . And the other apparitions . Like the one Mr. Pintero saw at the bowling alley . I think I have an idea about that , if not an explanation . Harold Spuller is at this facility voluntarily , which means he can come and go as he pleases . To kill those women , or to hold down a job or both . Oh , Scully . - Yeah , it 's okay . - You sure ? Yeah , it 's just- - I 'm fine . I just need to find a washroom . - [ Knocking On Door ] - [ Mulder ] Scully ? - [ Knocking On Door ] - [ Mulder ] Scully , you in there ? Yeah . They found another victim . A college student with her throat cut , just about half a block from here . [ Siren Wailing ] Her name was Lauren Heller , age 21 . She was single . Apparently she was on her way home from a bar that she part-timed at after school . She had a ring on her left hand . It was switched to her right hand . The pinkie finger . She was dead less than an hour when she was found . That would rule out Harold Spuller as the killer . No , actually it doesn 't . Harold 's not at the home . He 's nowhere to be found . His nurse locked him in his room after we left , but he managed to escape unnoticed . [ police Radio , indistinct ] I don 't imagine he 'd be too hard to find . Yeah , but we should be the ones to find him . If only to find out what " She is me " means . Mulder- - [ Sighs ] What ? I think I 'm gonna let you take care of that . I , uh , I think I 'm gonna get this checked out . Just , you know , just to be safe . - You want me to drive you ? - No , no , no . I 'm fine , really . I 've had the doctors keep a close watch , and this is just a precaution . - You 're sure ? - I 'm fine . Bye . [ Harold ] Nine , seventeen , twenty-six , thirty-two- - [ Continues Mumbling Numbers ] [ Continues Mumbling Numbers ] [ Harold ] No . No . I just want to be left alone . [ Doctor ] We 've spoken about your fear . You 've been afraid to express it to others , to Agent Mulder . - This is different . - How ? Several months ago , I was diagnosed with a cancerous mass . A nasal pharyngeal tumor that cannot be operated on , and cannot be treated by conventional medicine . I 'm sorry . I don 't mean for this to sound too dire . My health has been good . I have been checked up on a weekly basis . You 've kept working ? Yes . It 's been important to me . Why ? Why ? Um- - Agent Mulder has been concerned . He 's been supportive through this time . Do you feel that you owe it to him to continue working ? No . I guess I never realized ... how much I rely on him before this . His passion . He 's been a great source of strength that I 've drawn on . What happened last night , Dana ? I saw something . And I don 't know what to trust . If I saw it because of the stress ? Because the image had been suggested to me ? Or if it was a suggestion of my own fears ? Your fear of failing him ? [ Chuckles ] Maybe . What did you see ? I saw a woman who had recently been murdered . But I saw her . It appeared as if she was trying to tell me something . - Do you know what ? - No . Are you sure ? - Hey , you 're back . - Yeah . I 'm looking for Harold Spuller . Harold ? What for ? - Suspicion of murder . - You think Harold killed those women ? You obviously don 't think so , huh ? Harold 's worked for me for ten years . He might be crazy , but he couldn 't kill anyone . - He 's a sweet kid . - Yeah . You know where he is now ? - He was here this morning when I arrived , arranging the shoes . - He has a key ? No , he 's got some damn way of gettin ' in through an abandoned building next door . Did you ever get lane six working ? No . Not since I saw the girl . [ Mulder ] Harold ? Harold ? Harold , I just want to talk to you . Harold ? [ Harold Mumbling ] She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . [ Mumbling Continues ] She is me . She is me . Harold ? She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . She is me . Eight , seventeen , thirty , thirty-seven . I wanna make this clear from the start . My client is suffering from a mental disorder which impairs his judgment . He will not answer any questions regarding his guilt or innocence . I 'd be real happy if he 'd quit talking right now . Anytime Harold becomes upset or unwilling to cooperate , this interrogation will end . Detective Hudak ? Tell me why you did it , Harold , huh ? Come on . Tell me why you killed those women . What did I just say ? This is totally unacceptable . I am prepared to tell my client not to cooperate . - [ Mumbling Numbers ] - Harold , you knew those women who were murdered , didn 't you ? [ Mumbling Numbers ] That 's why you 're scared . You 're afraid they 've come back to visit you . Penny Timmons . Eight , seventeen , thirty , thirty-seven , forty-five , fifty-three , seventy-one , - eighty , ninety-two , ninety-nine , one-oh-eight . - Mrs. Schipiro . Fourteen , twenty-nine , thirty-eight , fifty-seven , seventy-one , seventy-nine , one hundred and one , one hundred and seventeen . Michelle Chamberlain . Seventeen , thirty-two , forty-nine , sixty-nine , seventy-eight , eighty-seven , ninety-nine . What was her shoe size ? - Six-and-a-half . - There you have it . - This is not a confession . - He killed them . - Harold , listen . I 'm advising you not to respond ... - He stalked them , fixated- - nor to cooperate with this investigation any further ! Harold , there are people that think you murdered these women . I 'm not one . But I need your help for me to prove that . You think you can do that ? I think you can . Mr. Pintero , I 'd like to search the building for anyways in or out , - that Harold might have of the bowling alley . - Sure . Thanks . You okay , Harold ? The shoes are out of order , Mr. Pintero . I 'm sorry . Hey , it 's okay , buddy . Don 't you worry about it . You get this straightened out with these folks , then come back and keep me in line . Okay , Mr. Pintero . [ Harold Mumbling Numbers ] I wanna know why the hell we 're being led around like this ? - I 'm hoping it will become clear to us when we find it . - Is that right ? - He 's gonna show us something that 's gonna exonerate him ? - I think so . Here . Here what ? My God , they 're all here . Every victim . - [ Attorney ] This proves nothing . - He fixated on them . I see hundreds of scorecards up here . - Thousands of names . - Choose a name . Pick a name . Pick any name up there . Fred Graham . Seventeen , forty-two , sixty-seven , eighty-eight , one hundred and seven , one hundred and twenty-two , one hundred and thirty-one , one hundred and sixty-six , - one hundred and seventy-eight , two hundred and one . - Two hundred game . Not bad . You 're saying he has all these scores in his head ? Including the victims . [ Attorney ] You said this proves his innocence . How ? - I 'm not sure exactly , but I think that- - - No ! No ! No , no , no ! - [ Harold Crying ] - [ Man ] Breathe ! One , two , three , four , five . Breathe . He just keeled . Fell right over . I 've done all I can . [ Sobbing ] Must 've been a heart attack . [ Doorbell ] Hey , Scully . Is it too late ? No . What are you doing , Mulder ? - I need your help on something . I needed your medical expertise . - On what ? Harold Spuller . Oh ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't even ask you . What did your doctor say ? - I 'm fine . - Good . What 's up , Mulder ? Angie Pintero , the bowling alley guy ? He 's dead . - How ? - Natural causes . Heart failure . Just keeled over . - That 's what you need my medical opinion on ? - No . Harold Spuller had a premonitory vision of his boss 's death . - I don 't understand . - Harold saw an apparition . What may have been Angie Pintero 's disembodied soul ... at the moment of or just prior to his death . - How do you know ? - Because I was standing right there when he saw it . - But you didn 't see it yourself ? - No . Why ? I don 't have that facility . That kind of connection to the victims that would have made such a vision possible . What 's Harold Spuller 's connection ? I don 't know its exact nature , but I think it has something to do with his autism . That Harold experienced a profound attachment to these victims , but because of his disability , was unable to express ... the depth and power of those relationships . So somehow a psychic or preconscious bond was formed that went beyond the temporal . Whoa , wait a minute . So Harold knew the people that were killed ? Yeah , from the bowling alley . Going back seven years . Even if what you 're saying is true , Harold wasn 't the only one who claims to have seen these apparitions . No . But he does have something in common with those who 've had the visions ... that is quite powerful in its own right . - Which is what ? - They were all dying . Um , one of emphysema , one of cancer and , uh , now Angie Pintero . Harold Spuller 's dying too ? Well , that 's what I need your medical opinion on . - Well , what if he isn 't ? - I would be very surprised . What is a death omen if not a vision of our own mortality ? And who among us would most likely be able to see the dead ? Harold 's at the resident home right now . I 'll meet you there . [ Alpert ] Harold ? [ Man ] Agent Mulder will be sending a doctor to examine you . [ Alpert ] Well , you 're back . It 's gonna be all right now , Harold . They just want us to keep you here for a little checkup . There 's nothing to worry about . Thanks , officers . All right , Chuck . Go to bed . You can see Harold in the morning . See ? Everyone 's so glad to see you back , Harold . You 'll be able to talk to Chuck in the morning . You still have to take your meds though , Harold . Keeps you flyin straight and level . Eighty , eighty-eight , ninety-two , ninety-nine . Come on . It 's the way we always do it . Seventy-eight , eighty-seven . Atta boy . Good stuff . Hi . Lucas brought him back . - [ Nurse Innes ] Is he acting up ? - No ! I think he 's just a little scared . I 've been tryin ' to get him to take his meds . Fourteen , twenty-nine , thirty-seven . - Why don 't you let me sit with him for a bit ? - Okay , sure . Take your poison , Harold . Go on . What 've you got to live for now , huh ? What did you tell them , Harold ? - Fifty-nine . - Did you tell them about your little girlfriends ? Huh ? - Did you tell them how you were in love ? - No ! Did you show them your pictures ? No . What do you think those girls thought of you , Harold ? Do you think they loved you back ? [ Mumbles ] No one could love you , Harold . Look at yourself . They looked at you and saw an ugly toad , a retard . - Agent Mulder . - Thanks for accommodating us again . - Not a problem . We 're all concerned for Harold . - I understand . - You 're bringing a doctor ? - Agent Scully 's a doctor . - If you could arrange to have Harold 's medical records made available- - - [ Scream ] Oh ! What 's happened to you ? - Oh ! - Don 't touch that . Don 't touch that . It 's just a cut . [ Nurse Innes ] He just went wacko . I was tryin ' to get him to take his meds and he went berserk . He jumps me , he starts pounding me like he wants to kill me . Did he say anything ? No , he just started screaming like a lunatic . Something 's gone wrong with him . I think he 's lost it for good . I 'll be damned if I 'm gonna take care of him anymore . I think you should get this cut on your head looked at . Maybe just give me a few minutes to get my nerves back . Okay , everybody , everything 's fine now . Come on , back to bed . That 's right , dear . Go on now . We 'll see you in the morning . Night-night , everybody . - What can I do to help ? - Call the police . Ask for Detective Hudak . Tell him what happened . Tell him to look for Harold down at the bowling alley . - Are they gonna arrest him ? - I don 't see that there 's anyway around that . I 'm sorry . - Maybe you were wrong . - Well , that 's a superficial head wound , Scully . He didn 't mean to kill her or maim her . That 's not the work of a murderer if you ask me . - Then why would he do it ? - Maybe Harold is sicker than we thought he was . Maybe . We won 't know until we can examine him . [ Mulder ] I think there 's someone you can talk to about it . Why don 't you talk to his roommate , and I 'll see what I can do about finding Harold . Oh , hi . - Is your name Chuck ? - Yes . Yes , it is . Chuck Forsch . F-O-R-S-C-H . Chuck Forsch . [ Clears Throat ] - Do you share this room with Harold ? - Yes , he 's my friend . Do you know where he is ? He 's dying , isn 't he ? - Harold is dying . - Why do you say that ? Nurse Innes . She 's , she 's trying to poison him . - Who told you that ? - Harold . He said she told him she was putting poison in his meds . - Harold hasn 't been taking his medication ? - I don 't know . I don 't know everything . I 'm only a human being . But I do know that- - that Harold 's my friend . He wouldn 't hurt anybody . You know , he really loved them . Who ? Harold , he gave them to me . He was afraid . Does anybody else know about these pictures , Chuck ? Nurse Innes . How are you feeling ? I 'm , you know , shaky . Understandable . Working with these people , it starts driving you crazy too . I 'm just looking forward to going home . - Will your family be a comfort ? - I live alone . No children ? Just the one my husband ran off with . Nurse Innes , I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to ask you to step out into the hallway . [ Yells ] Stay where you are ! Drop it ! - Let it go ! - [ Yelling ] [ Gunshot ] [ Groaning ] She 's alive . Let 's get a paramedic inhere . Yeah . - You 're cut . - Yeah , she attacked me . You might wanna bag that . I 'm pretty sure it 's the murder weapon . She had been taking Harold 's meds- - clonazepam and clozapine- - the unregulated effects of which are violence and unpredictable behavior . Yeah , but why did you even suspect her ? I went in to talk to Harold 's roommate , and he said that Harold thought she had been poisoning him . So I went in to confront her and she just went off . - Why do you think she killed those women ? - I don 't know . I mean , maybe in some drug-addled way , she was trying to kill happiness . Harold 's happiness . His love for those women . Maybe trying to destroy something she thought she 'd never have again . - " She is me . " - I don 't know . - Have they found Harold ? - Yeah . They found him in an alley a few blocks from here , face down on the pavement . They worked on him for 20 minutes , but he couldn 't be revived . - What happened ? - Well , preliminary diagnosis is apnea : respiratory failure . - As a result of what ? - The paramedics are at a loss to explain that . But if what you 're saying is true , that Harold stopped taking his medication , then that could have been a factor in his death . - At least in the visions that he was seeing . - Harold Spuller wasn 't dying . He was killed as a result of what that woman took away from him . Is that your medical opinion ? Is that your medical opinion ? - I saw something , Mulder . - What ? The fourth victim . I saw her in the bathroom before you came to tell me . Why didn 't you tell me ? Because I didn 't want to believe it . Because I don 't want to believe it . Is that why you came down here ? To prove that it wasn 't true ? No . I came down here because you asked me to . Why can 't you be honest with me ? What do you want me to say ? That you 're right ? That I believe it , even if I don 't ? Is that what you want ? - Is that what you think I want to hear ? - No . You can believe what you want to believe , but you can 't hide the truth from me . Because if you do , then you 're working against me . And yourself . I know what you 're afraid of . I 'm afraid of the same thing . The doctor said I was fine . I hope that 's the truth . I 'm going home . Subrip by dreamer ( C )

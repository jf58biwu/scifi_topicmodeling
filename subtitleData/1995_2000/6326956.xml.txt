Translation and adaptation Grizzly ( c ) thin Prietenul meu Crazy Eddie publică " Paranoid Times , " a site dedicated to information about our fight against alien invasion called Gua . Every week we get more and more e-mails from those who believe the incredible ... That aliens are here to conquer our planet . One of our readers sent us Robbie Harlock several e-mails unusual about Carson McAuliffe 's death during a Facilities in the pool , in the city of Normal , Illinois . E-mail was similar quatrain 66 the century VII . " Where are contaminated waters flow is obstructed nature , Youth is a prisoner of lightning devil whose use will be taming ardor rivals . " From personal experience , tracking e-mails can be risky . I know that our network of believers begin to grow and sometimes worth the risk . That brought me to a place called Normal . - No alien . - Lucky for you . You must be Robbie . You 're Cade Foster . I recognize the posters posted on the internet . Are you sure you got familiar with the absolute need for discretion ? Listen , I read your diary weekly , man . You 're right . The aliens are here . Undoubtedly . - Did you know Carson McAuliffe ? - So and so . Do you think his death was caused from an alien experiment ? So , I saw exactly , but I was at a party where he died . I heard that his face was electrocuted . I called the coroner . There is no report . Of course , do not forget to " X-Files " ? Sorry , no . Therefore , the report will say he died of pneumonia or normal disease . Listen , man , nobody talks about it , but strange things happen more in Normal . Carson is not the first to die in an unusual way . - There were others ? - Yes . I did not know , but my parents still talk about it . Some normal children , healthy , just like Carson . Well , Robbie , let me search the least appropriate . We can meet somewhere later in the city ? Somewhere to avoid the police ? Yes , Rogers Park . Nobody goes there . - Okay , see you there at noon . - Okay . Laura . Hi , Robbie . Come on up . My father is not home . - Health . - Health . Cade Foster is here . Do you realize what this means ? This means that even aliens are among us . What 's wrong with you ? I 'm sure somewhere in the universe there is alien life But here in Normal ? Come on , Robbie , sounds like a movie bad . But Carson 's death was weird and you know it . If you would be loved , I laugh from ear to ear . Please do not tell anyone about your belief in aliens . - They 'll believe crazy . - The dilemma of Cade Foster . I mean , you tell people how it is and they think you 're crazy . Why not let the police handle it ? As if I would listen to the police . You really are a freak . - Why do you love Me ? - Because I do not know anyone like you . You are funny , smart ... and because , when you look at me , you make me feel like I 'm the only girl on the planet . - I love you . - I love you . No , Robbie , stop . I have a headache . - Dad ! - Mr. Bennett . - Listen to me , I can explain better ? - Little pervert ! - Dad ! - I told you that I do not want to see you in this house . Stay away from her , or the name of the Lord , I will make you regret it . Stop it ! - Why did you come so suddenly ? - You live in my house ... And while you 're here , My duty is to protect you . Robbie kid was right . Four children died of natural causes but unusual . All were related to a nervous system malfunction . Other links ? According to these articles were of the best . Looks good , top athletes , popular . Type the children would make me vomit . - Hey , a little respect , huh ? - I apologize . There is something else . According to the coroner , the two children were found procaine . - Cocaine ? - No , procaine . Is an organic salt comprising Di-ethyl PABA and aminoethyl . Both are vitamin B , soluble in water . It affects the nervous system and prefrontal cortex . It is normal to have procaine into the system ? Our bodies have enough vitamin B , but procaine is not among them . - Is it poisonous ? - Only in large quantities . It is usually administered by resorption of water . Nostradamus said : " Where the water is contaminated , natural flow is obstructed . " Is it referring to the city 's water supply ? It 's a good place to start . I 'll take some samples from different parts of the city and check them . You ? I 'll talk to my buddy Robbie . Hold on . Are you sure you can trust him ? Do not worry , Eddie , is paranoid , antisocial and funny as you do . I like him already . - Robbie . - You came . Good . Have you found anything ? Yes , there seems to be a connection between Carson and the other three children . Well , listen , I have some good news . I spoke with Sondra , Carson 's girlfriend , who saw how he died . - He will meet us at the house of my girlfriend . - Good work . Yes , but you must leave . Do not have much time . - Why ? Is there a problem ? - Yes . Laura 's father . I do not like . It was horrible . - How did it happen ? - I went to Laura 's room . I began to kiss . Suddenly crazy . - Razna ? - It was as if it was plugged in . Electricity walk across his face . Is there anything else ? Something said or did Carson ? Carson , no . We have to stop . - I started to feel bad . - You changed your mind ? No , I did . I wanted to make love ... - But I had to stop . - Why ? Headaches began to appear when affairs were heated . - So you asked him to stop . - But it did not . He was so excited . He continued to kiss me and touch me , and then ... I read some of his journals . - I think my father is an alien . - Your dad 's a jerk , not alien . How do you know ? Remember grill that I made ... before your mother die ? Your father cut her hand ... - And bled for about two hours . - And ? Aliens heal instantly . This is a method by which you can tell if someone is Gua . Okay , maybe not an alien ... - But it is a jerk . - Yes . - That 's your father ? - You should not have to get up late . We have to leave right now . Seriously , her father , man . We must leave now . Are you okay ? What the hell is going on , Laura ? - I need your help , Robbie . - Whatever you want , buddy . Ask your friends and see if some of them have problems . Problems ? Love , love , sex . Try to find a link . Wait , I can not ask that . You look like a moron . What to say : " Hey , man , how was last night in bed ? " I mean , you beat me . Listen , I do not know these kids . You know them . - Let me ask you something . - Sure . - Why are you doing this ? - What ? - That , journals and more . I mean , you should know that nine out of ten people think you 're crazy . Besides , with accusations of murder if you 're looking to be caught and to spend the rest of his life in jail . I 'm trying to prove my innocence . How can you prove something that most people can not see ? Why do you think they are here ? For that crazy stuff happen and for that , I believe in you . Until we get the evidence , we are both crazy . Listen , I 'll talk to some people . Okay ? - Let me see what I can do . - Okay . Hey , Robbie ! Thank you . You are a great help . You know when I have something . - Foster , how 's it going ? - I talked to his girlfriend . According to her description , boy went through a big calefaction while prostate bed . I think this has triggered death . If sexual desire is fatal , then you are on the go . Thanks for letting me say that , Eddie . What have you found in samples of water ? I made a basic test and found nothing . There procaine water supply to the city . I do not understand , Eddie . Sondra said the boy was electrocuted and you talk about a drug called procaine . That makes no sense . - You 're wrong , my dear Watson . - I hear you , Sherlock . Procaine facilities are transferred ion electric and then are absorbed into the bloodstream . Maybe that 's " lightning devil , " that Nostradamus said . If the human brain absorbs enough procaine , is a ... Super conductor of electricity . But how did procaine in Carson 's body ? And how current voltage is so high that killed him ? That we need to know now . We must put his hand on the prosecutor reports to see if there is something we do not know about Carson McAuliffe . It will not be easy . - But it is something we do easily ? - Well , talk to you later . - You think I 'm unreasonable , Laura ? - Yes . When you 're older , you 'll understand . - I do not get in touch with age ? - It is not right , you destroy the future because a guy wants to get their hands on you all . I can take care of myself . I do not think you can . It 's sad what happened to Carson , but Sandra has learned a lesson . Every action has consequences . - Do not you , Sandra ? - That 's right , sir . Bennett . You must learn to control yourself . When I say I do not want to see him that boy here , seriously . If you see him one day here , I 'll call the police . - Can I help you ? - Hi , Easterly of the departments are Simon examination ... From the Southern Illinois . I 'm looking for dr . Crane , Prosecutor . I am this . - What can I do for you ? - I was wondering if ... have finished the report on Carson McAuliffe and if I could look it over . Do you have a formal application or written permission from the family of the deceased ? - No , I have not . - Then you 're in luck . Our reports are available after approval by the State Attorney . I know the family . I just went through the city and I thought you might make an exception . No exception . I see . I 'm sorry to bother you . Have a good day . What happened to the other reports that we have sent ? What other reports ? There were three reports . All about population with abnormal cause of death . Carson McAuliffe was the 4th . I do not think I saw these reports . I sent them to the police department and then examined . Young people usually do not die in perfect health because of cerebral aneurysms . - So Carson McAuliffe died ? - That I will write his report . I do not know how else to call it . If you have not seen the reports , then you have not seen any cranial extraction . - What is it ? - Source unknown , partly organic mechanical part . I found it the medulla oblongata at each of the four victims . - Where are the other 3 samples ? - Tell me your that . I did research , I sent a bunch of letters . It seems that no one knows what happened to them . I see . Do you mind if I take this sample ... - To examine quietly . - Of course it bothers me . This leaves the laboratory sample . Thank you for your help . Let me see what I can do . Hello , I 'm calling about Simon Easterly . Tell that works for you . Da , aşa e , Easterly . - I found something , Eddie . - Attorney ? Yes . These kids died from cerebral aneurysms , at least so write reports ... - Have that kind of mechanism in their head . - As part of the head ? Damn ! I knew you ask me that . - Something with spinal ... - medulla , is the prefrontal cortex . - It is associated with the hypothalamus . - What does that mean ? We are talking about hormones , Foster . We all know that teenagers are full of hormones . I have to go , Eddie . Police . - Mr. Easterly ? - Da . Mind if I come with me to the police station ? I have some questions for you . You lied about your job . So you can lie in connection with your name . There are Simon Easterly . Well , Simon . If you do not work in departments examination , where you work ? I 'm a private detective . I work for a lawyer representing the family of the deceased boy . In relation to security . Boy dies young . Parents want to know if someone is guilty . - What you got ? - What ? - Who is to blame ? It 's kind of hard to tell time . Want some coffee ? Da . What were you expecting to find the prosecutor ? Do a little checking . It seems that Carson McAuliffe was not the only boy who died in unusual circumstances . - What do you know about it ? - I just read in the papers . 4 children , perfectly healthy died in his prime . From the medical examiner says that all have died of cerebral aneurysms . Yes , usually brain aneurysms affect people aged 60 years . Besides , all children had a strange kind of mechanism in the head . Does it look natural ? No , not at all . From what I 've heard Carson 's death was quite strange . Attorney agrees . Tell them that the reports ... There were promptly processed by her colleagues . You do not say . Have you investigated and the other dead ? Da . It was a real puzzle . Listen , I 'll let you go with a warning this time . But from now on it would be better to be right with me while staying here . - So I will , thanks . - One more thing . If you find anything unusual , tell me first . Come on , you run back to the car . I know it 's strange , but I have to ask about you and Jill . When you make love or something , you feel any pain or something ? Headaches ? I know there are personal questions . I just ... Headaches ? When you and Sarah ... Headaches ? And you ? Hold on . - What are you doing ? - I 'm leaving . What do you think . - Not going anywhere . - Can not stop me . - Do not push me ! The mother died when you 've changed . - I hate living here . - Why ? Because I want to keep him away on that fool you ? Robbie ! His name is Robbie . I know something is wrong here . - What ? - Right now trying to discover What really happened with Carson . We know what happened to Carson . Phoning girlfriend of yours ... - And did brain aneurysm . - No . Something 's weird , I know . That and Robbie . To put Cade Foster to verify this . - Stay away from Robbie . - Fuck you ! - You little bitch ! How dare you ? - What are you staring at ? - Oh , God ! You 'll stay in this room until I get back or you 'll be sorry . No ! Foster , I found the Holden 's report on the police scanner . - I thought you were caught . - I escaped , Eddie . Holden cover me . Maybe it was too easy . No fingerprints or anything not checked . - Do you think it is somehow involved in this ? - I can say is man . But the prosecutor 's report had to go the police and then to the medical examiner . Somewhere around 3 mechanisms head disappeared and reports have been modified . - In connection with hormones , I checked clippings . - And ? - The first child died in the back row of a cinema and the other two died at a observation of an old country road called Lover 's Lane . Carson died in the bedroom with his girlfriend . - Sex . - Or at least tried it . What is it ? Try to stop teenagers do stupid ? Can virgins need for some kind of experiment . Maybe it has something to do with population control , Eddie ? Or a gun ? - Get excited , you fry . - Nostradamus was right . " The flow is obstructed nature , a young devil is destroyed by lightning , " Procaine and device interrupt sex and induce clinical death . Yes , but what is meant by " Whose use will be taming ardor rivals . " I do not understand . We need to look more closely at the mechanism to do some tests . Yes , but we would have a laboratory for that . I can not do that here . We have one prosecutor 's office . Come on man , if we get caught ? Do not worry , expected to be made later to use it . - How late ? Next year ? - See you there . - I need to speak with you . - Hello , sir . Bennett . - I hear you . - I know for a long time , John . - I need your help . - Sure . What is it ? We had a big fight with Laura today . He wants to leave home . I think that 's normal adolescents . Everything happens because that boy , Robbie Harlock . - So and boys is normal . - Not this one . Speak with a private investigator . I know , I heard it . I questioned in my office . - His name is Simon Easterly . - Laura says his name is Foster . The man walks with young . A harassing my daughter . I want to know who he is and to make sure you stay away from my house . I 'll put restriction , if you need to . - Okay , great . Where 's the mechanism ? - Easy , Eddie . Here . Something is not normal in Normal . - Since I wanted to say that . - Leave puns , Eddie . Come to find out what happens . The prosecutor said that is part organic and part mechanical . I can say that 's right . Nostradamus said that the youth would be destroyed by lightning devil . I think so . Technically , hormones young people react to procaine . After that increases hormonal activity that triggers this . - I could kill you ? - Probably . It 's just speculation . But this organic material can be used to create a connection with brain tissue . And the mechanical part is that shock even ... And now comes procaine , right ? Right . Let 's do a little experiment . Hands up . - Hei . - Robbie , unde e tata ? I do not know . His car was in the street . What 's going on ? I was right . It is alien . - Who 's the alien ? - Tata . I scratched his face and healed in an instant . Este Cave . - How ? It 's my biological father . - Wait , wait . The aliens have serious genetic technology than we , so ... Maybe your father is a genetic clone . - You know how this sounds ? - No , listen to me . Listen to me . Your mother died in that accident , but your father was not even hurt . Maybe then replaced it clone aliens . You 're making a mistake . Yes ? Mr. Easterly , or as you 're told ? Children die in your city . Just trying to find out why . For this barge on state property ? Yes , I tried to find evidence . - What kind of evidence ? - Look at this , man . - Bobby , Fill , Morin , Diane , Susan ... - They all had headaches ? - Yes , but one . - But you did not , right ? I hope neither . The prosecutor found that the head of Carson McAuliffe . The same mechanism was found in all four cases . What do you think that is ? It seems that send messages to the brain controlling sexual urges . How is this happening ? By that sends a strong signal probably strong enough that electrocute the victim . As long as it is in water and procaine . Procaine mechanism needs to be activated . - And where did you find that procaine ? - Is commercial . - I mean , where are these kids ? - I 'm not sure . It is generally administered by the absorption of water . Potable water supply in the city has tested negative . Damn ! There are so stupid ! Swimming Pool . Carson died a pool party at Bennett . Okay , let 's go . Come on , Laura . Let 's go . Hold on . I warned you . I never considered a first test subject . Today is going to change that . - The pool is in the back . - Why not just take a sample and leave . Relax , Eddie . - It 's your job . - Lead us . Laura 's parents did not die in a car crash , right ? You had something to do with it . I 'll punch medulla , Robbie , after which I will insert this object in the cortex . Finally you regularly absorb procaine . You should be happy . I spend more time together at the pool . You will not remember anything . - None of that . - No ! There 's nothing to fear . Once it 's done . Implantation process is complete . Not affected spine or vital signs . S-a terminat , Bennett . Very good , John . I see you brought Foster . One is to experiment on people with that mechanism , but not us . I can not let that happen . Terminal phase is initiated . The destruction of all implants . You Gua . Why do not you kill me ? Why do not you tell others ? Why did you help us ? I pursued . Just doing my job . - You covered Bennett . - That 's right . Why did you have helped ? We chose to fight against our mission . What does that mean ? Our forces were going to destroy humanity . Will come soon . We have millions on this planet . Our leaders are afraid that they will be consumed by human passions . " Youth is a prisoner of lightning devil use of which will be taming ardor rivals . " You are rival . These mechanisms have been studied in humans , but are made for us , so we can control the human form , to stop us to have sex with us . That 's the irony , Foster . We tested the mechanism we use to us . So , this is where everything happens , right ? Great ! Yes , this is it . Alien Command Center . - It 's so cool ! - I 'm glad you like it . - How are you , Robbie ? - Well , I went to the doctor . He said he did not trace anything , so it seems they 're good . - Laura 's fine . Same with everyone . - It 's good . - Yes and no . The mechanism was set to self-destruct . Our proof has evaporated . No evidence ? I guess that means we 're still crazy . Groups of believers grow and maybe Gua group that their leaders will fight against the invasion which It seems that soon will become reality . My journey is long and sometimes paths seem never to end , but then there is something that reminds me that our efforts bearing fruit . And I sense that we are approaching fulfillment of purpose . To overcome Gua and bring things back to normal . Translation and adaptation Grizzly ( c ) thin

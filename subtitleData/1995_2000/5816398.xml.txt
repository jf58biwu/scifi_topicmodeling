 [ man screams ] [ screams ] [ gasping ] The Drug Lord 's behind the limo . - Frag him . - Back off . I am the law . WYATT : Oh , yeah ! Gun shot ! Gun shot ! Wounded ! Finish him off ! GARY : Kill ! Kill ! BOTH : Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! I , uh , I think we were ready for a time-out anyway . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Uh , sorry . Looks like we found our power problem . It 's my magic detector . I 'm hunting genies . - WYATT : Hunting genies ? - This scanner detects magic and teleports the source to that transporter pad . This isn 't going to make us sterile , is it ? Like it matters . Why the sudden push to find another genie ? Think of the billions of computers in the world . Chances are , there 's got to be another genie out there somewhere . I can 't be completely alone in the world . You 're not alone , you got us . But you guys have got family- - People who are like you . What do I have ? Barbara Eden and a big fat blue guy who talks like Robin Williams . The truth is out there . [ beeping ] [ buzzing ] Guys , I got signals . Is it Genie ? The magic detectors are jumping like fleas on a griddle . As soon as I get the sleep boogers out of my eyes somebody 's going to die . Stand back , Chett . I 've got magic readings of the Yin-Yang . [ shouting ] [ deep , echoing voice ] : Who dares disturb the Genie of the Lamp ? [ all whimpering ] Uh ... hi . My name 's Lisa . I 'm the one who brought you here . - You 're not mad , are you ? - [ normal voice ] : Mad ? Ha . What man could display anger in the presence of such breathtaking loveliness ? May I , Lisa ? - Good opening line . - Very smooth . Seen better . Name 's Chett Donnelly . What handle do you go by , balloon pants ? My name is Gene and I apologize if it lacks the sly wit of " balloon pants " . And do you dress yourself , Gene or does your master pick your clothes ? Not anymore . [ chuckles ] Well , that 's much better . You can forget the Alamo and crush that putrid yellow rose because I 'm finally free of that Demented Texas Hobgoblin . Who ? GENE : My current master discovered me in 1956 and spirited me away to Texas . Believe me , that 's no place for a civilized magical creature . Nothing but cows , dust and mentally unbalanced football fans . How can I ever repay you for breaking me out ? You don 't have to . I 've always dreamed of meeting someone like me . You mean to say you 're a genie as well ? - Damn skippy . - [ laughing ] - Shall we ? - Shall we what ? I 'm dying for a decent martini preferably in a bar that doesn 't serve ribs and suds . Corral your longhorn , pal . With your sparkly pixic magic and expect Lisa to go off with you . Later . Have her back by 11 : 00 . # Home , home one on the range # # Where the deer and the antelope play ... # Unbelievable . There 's no escape it . - Think you can do better ? - Ooh , a challenge . # ... all day # Good evening , ladies and gentlemen and welcome ot the Yum-Yum Room . My name is Gene . My first number tonight is for a special little lady who 's change my life . A girl who 's from his part of town . [ soft rock music playing ] # There 's a girl ini this harbor town # # And she works laying whisky down # # They say Lisa , fetch another round # # She serves them whiskey and wine # # The sailors say , Lisa , you 're a fine girl # # Hoo- - what a good wife you would be # # Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea # # What a good wife you would be # # But my life , my love and my lady # # Is the sea # # Whoo-whoo-whoo # # You 're a fine girl # [ applause ] # Such a fine girl ... # To the most beautiful lady genie I 've ever met . Your radiance shames the stars . How many lady genies have you met ? Well , I stopped counting around 4,000 . - Are you jealous ? - Curious . - Hmm . - I 've had a wonderful time but you know , you haven 't answered any of my questions . I want you to tell me everything . What , and rob you of the pleasure of discovery ? Come on , please ? Where do genies come from ? Is there a lot of us ? Is there like a secret club , or something ? Lisa , there 's magic everywhere . It 's down there with the mortals it 's up here with us . We mustn 't squander our precious time together . Who knows how long it will be before my masters comes looking for me . My masters are pretty cool . I mean , Gary and Wyatt ask for goofy things but we 're equals . They love me . Now , the other one this Chett ... Should I be jealous ? Well , he and I sort of ... we almost ... - Uh-huh . - We did kiss once but ... well , you know , - he 's Chett . - [ chuckles ] [ sniffing ] I smell hot cheese . Sorry . Must have followed me in . - Hey ! Hey ! Fondue ! - Don 't be think about it , pus barge . But I love fondue . Exactly . It 's delicious and fun to make . That 's why there 's no way Lisa will be able to resist . So far , Timmy the Turban has been kicking my butt in the romance department but after tonight there 's going to be a new sheriff in love gulch . Get real . What could you possibly do that would lure Lisa away from Gene . - He has fondue . - Cheese and meat . And if the seductive power of fondue fails to do the trick I 've rented her favorite movie . Howard the Duck ? Maybe you do have a shot . And the topper the time-honored symbol of man 's undying affection the chick 's name carved permanently into wood . Tell me this doesn 't scream a commitment . - It will never work . - Even with the fondue ? You better pray it does work . Why would Lisa hang with you flank spankers when Gene " the Magnificent " is taking her hip-hopping on rings of Saturn ? Unless I give her a reason to stay ... It 's good-bye genie . - She loves cheddar . - Make it sharp . - Hey , guys . - Alaska rocks . It 's bigger than Texas , there 's more oil and they don 't give and Armadillo 's Patootie about Emmitt Smith . LISA : And we learned this neat trick . - Eskino kiss . - Eskino kiss . That sound like an adventure . You must be ready for a night in . I 've got fundue and Howard the Duck . - I love fundue . - Well , everyone loves fundue . - but , uh , Lisa and I have plans . - Gene 's taking me back to the dawn of creation so we can watch the Big Bang Together . Oh . You 're tanking . Go with the plaque . - Uh , Lisa ... - Oh , before we go you guys have got to see what Gene made me . He carved it himself . He 's so good with his hands . How nice for him . Give it up , little man . She is way out of your league . [ laughing ] [ plaque hits floor ] A little visit to Gene 's home away from home . Oh . Oh , yeah . Now I 've got your number , curly toes . [ laughing ] - Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! - Stop being such a baby . Well , blow , blow . - Oh , oh , oh . - I told you to wear sunscreen . Hi , kids . Fun day at the beach ? Well , it would have been if you humans hadn 't destroyed the ozone layer with your damned aerosol squirt cheese . Well , I know just the thing to cheer you up . An old friend of yours stopped by for a visit . Howdy . Long time no see . Hey , Master . What have you been up to , Genie ? A little beach blanket bingo ? He can play in my sandbox any old time . Darlin ' , I can 't have you 're flirtin' while I 'm trying to discipline the Genie . It seems my days of playing hooky have ended . You got that right . Hop in this lamp and let 's scoot ! - May I clean out my teapot , Master ? - No lollygagging . Excuse me , but who are you ? Oh ! I beg your pardon , ma 'am . Butayne 's the name . H. Boyd Butayne ? Noted Texas Billionaire H. Boyd Butayne ? What are you doing here ? Well , see , I rose the other day , AM , and what do I find ? I got a lamp with no genie in it . Little Missus here was sadder than a sack of sumbitches . - Come on , Gene ! - Chop , chop ! Gene , you don 't have to go . I can flash fry this little runt . Well , as much as I despise him he is my master . The time we shared together was precious . I 'll never forget you , Lisa . He 's such a charmer , ain 't he ? He 's gone . I know it hurts now but give it some time . And don 't forget , you can always rely on me . I almost forget . Thanks for the tip-off , boy . - How could you hurt me like this ? - I ... I , um ... Just when I started to think that you might be an okay guy . Ah , hell . - You sure you want to do this ? - I screwed up ! I ruined Lisa 's life by getting Gene busted . The only way to set things right is to get him back and that 's what I 'm going to do , even if it kills me . - It might kill you . - Huh ? Look , I think I got this thing set in reverse but it 's kind of hard to tell . It will either transport you to Buyayne 's Mansion or ... Or melt you like an army man over a lit match . Kick it ! [ motor whirring ] [ snoring ] [ whirring continues ] [ snoring ] [ snoring continues ] Chett ? What are you doing here ? Surely you didn 't come to Texas of your own free will ? Listen up . You got to go back to Lisa . - She 's crazy about you . - Unfortunately , I have no say in the matter . I am bound to serve the one who summons me . Yeah , well , I summoned you and I 'm ... Wait a minute . You mean , since I , uh ... ? Yes , yes . Anything your little heart desires . - A billion dollars . - Oh , that 's new . Hot chow ! A billion samolians ! Anything else , my predictable new master ? Well , yeah . You bet your silky drawers there 's something else . Let 's see . I wish , uh ... hmm ... I wish ... I thought you were an okay guy . You 've done some rotten things ... okay guy ... I 'll never be with you now . [ sighs ] I wish for your freedom . My freedom ? Really ? Ha ! I 'm free ! - Aw , groovy ! - Yeah . Just ... - be good to Lisa , okay ? - Lisa ? [ laughs ] I 'm afraid that 's impossible . Oh , sure , she 's good fun but she 's not relationship material . You 've been rubbing noses with somebody else ? Guilty as charged . Oh . Well , how about I teach you to rub noses with my fist . Well , bravo . I certainly had that coming . What in the name of Troy Aikman is going on here ? Chett here just freed me , you cud-munching troglodyte and my first act as a free genie is to claim the hand of my true love . - Muffin ! - Marie ? ! Oh , dearie me . Isn 't this awkward ? Uh , I was talking about Lupe . - Senor Gene ! - [ chuckles ] Oh ! Give me some sugar , baby . Yo . Smokey . Doesn 't it bother you you 're going to break Lisa 's heart ? Well , of course it pains me . You think I like being a cad ? It 's my curse . Keep an eye on Sunday 's game , Boyd because your little cowboys are going down . Not my cowboys ! You better not zap my cowboys . Here goes nothing . Where are they ? They should be back by now , shouldn 't they ? Uh , I 'm sure they 'll by zapping in any minute . Be patient . Chett 's a marine . Covert Ops are his specialty . Gee . I wonder who this is from . " Dear Lisa . Chett freed me . " I 'm off to see the universe . I 'll never forget the time we spent together but I 've run off with the maid . " Hope this expensive gift will take the sting out of it . Fondly , Gene . " Ouch . Well , wa-hoo . It was horrible ! An ugly , bloody blur . That crazy cowboy wouldn 't let him go ! Guns , dogs , land mines . But Gene ... Gene was a hero . That damn brave fool . He ate a grenade to save me . Lisa , he died with your name on his lips . [ sobbing ] A grenade killed the 4,000 years old immportal genie ? - Uh ... a genie-killing grenade . - And he was thinking about me , huh ? Right . So ... you shouldn 't be heartbroken about him blowing up or anything because he really loved you . - What else did Gene say ? - Oh . Um ... well , he said you were absolutely perfect . Funny ... kind ... heart-stoppingly beautiful . Every time he is with you he feels like he really matters . He said you 're the kind of girl who a loser like him can only dream about . - Gene ... said all that ? - With a grenade in his mouth ? Oh , yeah . And he wanted you to have this . He made it himself . This is the most beautiful thing anyone has ever given me . It 's a shame I can 't think Gene- - him being dead and all- - But I can thank you for ... you know ... delievering his last message . I 'm going to go now . Oh , shut your pie holes . He did a nice thing . And if you 'll excuse me I 'm putting this over my computer . I can 't seem to find the right man . Maybe it 's not a man you should be looking for . You think I might find happiness in the animal kingdom , ducky ? - Oh , sorry . - My mistake . - My fault . - Go ahead . Captioned by Grant Brown

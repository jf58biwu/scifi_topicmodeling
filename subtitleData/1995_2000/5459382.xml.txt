 - Previously on The Pretender . - I know the truth . And what truth is that , Jarod ? The truth ... about what makes you sad . - Your mother was a special person . - My mother was weak . Period . The only thing that ever bothered me was : Why in an elevator ? Your mother was a very special woman . There was a part ofher I knew better than anyone . There was a part ofher she kept hidden , separate . [ Miss Parker ] Is that all you do , Jarod ? Dig up the past ? That 's easy for you to say . You have one . [ Screaming ] Mama ! Mama ! - They 're trying to hurt her ! - Stay here , Jarod . - [ Gunshot ] - Mama , no ! - [ Gunshot ] - No . ! Mama ! [ Gunshot ] [ Phone Rings ] - What ? - [ Sydney ] We 've got a hit . Jarod 's the finest sewer rat I 've had the pleasure to work with . I 've never seen someone so excited about excrement in my life . A real fecal aficionado . [ Miss Parker ] How charming . - [ Sydney ] How long was Jarod here ? - Couple of weeks . - That 's all it took him to figure it out . - [ Miss Parker ] Figure what out ? That we were digging into an aquifer . If we had hit that thing , it would 've flushed 45 members ... of the International Brotherhood of Sewage Workers ... right into the jaws of oblivion . Just like that Egyptian army in The Ten Commandments . Whoosh ! Great . Now Jarod is Moses . Moses ? - Charlton Heston . - [ Chuckles ] Right . Thanks . Mr. McElroy , this is where Jarod always emerged ? Right in this spot . Something special about it , but he wouldn 't tell me . Said he had to ship out . Commander Forrester , we have a situation here . - Report . - Bogey , sir . Victor-class submarine , bearing one four eight . [ Jarod ] And closing . Why does the fun part have to happen on my watch ? - Alert the X.O. and the captain . - Aye , aye , sir . We 've got a fight on our hands . [ Man Narrating ] - [ Man ] Attention on deck . - [ Man # 2 ] As you were . Captain Nagel . Commander Nashton . It 's the Rostov , sir . After she deployed from Odessa ... the Uzbeki captain declared independence from the Black Sea Fleet . - He 's rogue . - With a hip pocket full of nuclear warheads . And judging from the intel file , her first strike target ... is Los Angeles . [ Beeping ] - Something 's up , sirs . - They 've opened the V.L.S. doors . Those S.L.B.M. ' s will be ready to fire in approximately two minutes . Torpedoes in the water , bearing one three seven and one four two . - Ready torpedo decoy . - Ready decoy . Ready decoy . Aye . Something 's wrong with this relay , sir . - What 's the problem , Baker ? - Aaah ! We 've lost the decoy signal . - Gentlemen , we got a torpedo on our ass . - Torpedoes closing , 300 yards . - The decoy signal 's still dead , sir . - 200 yards . Ninety seconds to S.L.B.M. launch . Come on , Baker . - Got it . Decoy 's on line , sir . - [ Beeping ] Torpedo number one just took the bait . Number two closing . It 's a miss . Rostov 's V.L.S. system is still ready . Those nukes fly in one minute , sir . - Forty degrees starboard . - [ Man ] Forty degrees starboard . - Steady on course ... zero nine zero . - [ Man ] Zero nine zero . Sir , suggest we fire both torpedoes now while he 's still in range . [ Jarod ] Sir . I recommend that we fire one now ... that we veer approximately 30 degrees starboard and then fire torpedo two . - Veer ? Why don 't we just ... - Fire torpedo one . [ Woman ] Fire one . Aye . Torpedo away . Thirty seconds until warhead launch . - Veer thirty degrees starboard . - [ Jarod ] Right full rudder . Steady course one two zero . [ Man ] Right full rudder , one two zero . Aye . One is a miss , sir . - Fire two . - Fire two . Aye . - Torpedo away . - Twenty seconds until warhead launch . Those birds are hot . Ten seconds until warhead launch . Number two is a direct hit . She 's going down . [ Cheering , Clapping ] [ Man ] This is Captain Drucker of the Harrison . [ Mimics Russian Accent ] You 've blown us out of water , you crazy Yankee pig . Acknowledged . Always a pleasure to run a simulation with you , Ted . Never a cold war when you need one . Harrison out . You got nothing to smile about . Another three seconds ... and L.A. ' s a parking lot . [ Woman ] Way to go , Baker . Lieutenant Commander Forrester ... this crew is loose . It 's too loose . The Monroe is a team , like links in a chain . If one of those links breaks under stress ... we slip that much closer to disaster . [ Loudly ] In one week , we hit the big blue . It is imperative that your response times improve . After what happened on our last tour ... I want this ship running like a damn Swiss watch . All right . You just traded your day off for a ride on my personal highway to hell . [ Nashton ] Left , left , left . ! Come on , people . ! It 's a highway to hell . We love it . ! Come on . ! - Having fun yet ? - [ All ] Yes , sir ! Come on , people . ! Do you love it ? - Yes , sir ! - I can 't hear you . ! Yes , sir ! Let 's go . Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go . Come on . What are you waiting for ? Let 's go . Move it . - Move it out . Move it out . Move it out . - [ Yells ] Move it out ! Move ! Move ! Move ! [ Jarod ] Move ! Move ! Move ! [ All Shouting ] I didn 't really want a day off . Did you , Baker ? - What ? - You can 't even handle a little circuit flare-up ? I mean , if something goes wrong this tour ... you 're not gonna screw up on us like you did in the pump room with Seaver ? Seaver was a dumb-ass . [ Woman ] Hey , get him . ! Get him . ! [ All Yelling ] [ Jarod ] Break it up ! Get up ! Break it up ! Knox ! Marcus ! Baker , you 've got the highest rank here . If I even catch you looking at these sailors the wrong way ... I 'm gonna have you in the scullery every day for a week ! - Understood , sailor ? - Yes , sir ! - Fall out ! - [ Man ] All right . Move out . [ Man # 2 ] Sir . Well , you handled that little situation well . Just as well as maneuvers this morning . Sir , I 'm sorry about that . - I didn 't mean to step out of line . - Oh , yes , you did . You 're just lucky that you made the right call . I guess . Nagel seemed pretty steamed about the last tour . Yeah , well , that 's the only chink in his armor . We lost a sailor . There was a gas leak in the pump room . - A gas leak ? - Yeah . JX-5 . Whoa . A roomful of that could 've set off the entire ship . Whoo . Tell me about it . I had the deck that night . It 's pretty intense . It 's not something I want to live through again . Hey , tell me something , will ya ? How did you know that the Harrison was gonna cut and run ? " Bulldog " Ted Drucker was at the conn . - It 's his favorite evasive technique . - Oh , you served with him ? Actually , Jarod 's from the Grant , sir . Lieutenant Paula Pratt . At ease . Security officer . Lieutenant Commander Jarod Forrester . Yes . I just ran the required checks on your file . Your dates on the Grant don 't jibe with the Bureau of Personnel . So why don 't you call the Grant and have ' em clear it up ? I will . As soon as she gets back from a silent escort in Antarctica . Next month . Come see me at P.S.D. tomorrow . That woman needs a hobby . She reminds me of someone I used to know . Go through the box from Jarod 's last lair . Call me with solid leads . [ Sydney ] Where will you be , Miss Parker ? - Out . - [ Beeps Off ] Well , there must be something you can tell me about my mother . It 's been nearly 30 years , but I remember how much she loved the children here . I have reason to believe that she might have rescued some of them . - Rescued ? - It 's a long story . Did she ... Did she bring any children here ? No . We 've always gotten our children the usual way : orphans , runaways , victims of child abuse . - I 'm afraid I wouldn 't know where to begin . - [ Sighs ] I might . I 'm sorry . None of them ring a bell . That 's okay . You 've been ... You 've been very helpful . Who is this Jarod you 're asking about ? An associate . I thought maybe he might have visited you . No . - [ Sighs ] - It 's not a dead end , Miss Parker . Well , the person who gave this to me is the master of the dead end . You could match these with our files ... but you 'd have to go down to the Hall of Records . All of these kids are pre-1970 . Our files were destroyed in a fire that year . You had a fire in 1970 ? Yes . April . How did you know ? That 's when my mother died . At ease . - Good afternoon , sir . - Good afternoon . - Just want to welcome you to the Monroe . - At ease . Uh , Bazooka . From my personal stash . For me ? This is interesting . Bubble gum named after a weapon . Hmm . Well , it 's been around a while . It 's very good . And it comes with its own personal story . [ Laughing ] Very clever . Well , thank you very much . As you were . [ Laughing ] [ Girl ] Get away from me . ! Leave me alone . ! I said get ... Get away from me . ! Stop it ! [ Panting ] - [ Yelps ] - Are you going someplace ? Look , there 's two men chasing me . I think they 're some kind of perverts . You 've really gotta help me . - That 's them ! - Commander . Is there some kind of problem , Sergeant ? Yes , sir . We caught this bug trying to hot-wire an ensign 's jeep . Oh , that 's a great big lie . Besides , I didn 't even know the jeep belonged to the ensign . It 's the third time this week we 've had a run-in with this desperado . I see . I think I can handle it from here . - My name 's Jarod . - Melina Pratt . Pratt ? As in Security Officer Pratt ? As in her daughter . - You 're gonna tell her about this , aren 't you ? - What about your father ? He 's the navigator on the Farragut . - That 's on the Indian Ocean , on patrol ? - Yeah . He 's been gone for about four months now . Four and a half . Must be pretty tough on you ... and your mother , your father being gone that long . My mom just works more . To me , it 's no biggie . So your dad is gone , and your mom works all day . From what I understand , a teenager lives for that kind of freedom . Is that true ? If you 're so interested in teenagers , maybe you should become a high school counselor . I already tried that once . I mean , the hours were great , but ... the food was terrible . So , are you gonna tell my mom about this jeep thing or not ? - Melina . - What ? Next time you go to so much trouble ... to get into trouble ... hot-wire an admiral 's jeep . [ Man On P.A. ] Communications watch officer and D.D. O ... please report to the quarterdeck . Comm watch officer and D.D.O. , report to the quarterdeck . That 's nice work ... for an oxyacetylene weld . It 's old-school , I know , but it holds tighter than any of that newfangled stuff . Snipes are always getting on me . TIG weld this , gas tungsten that . Got no respect for the old ways , you know . - I guess not . - [ Chuckles ] Excuse me . [ Nagel ] Problem , Jarod ? As you were . Petty Officer Mike Baker . I pulled him out of a fight a couple of days ago . - I have a good mind to go up there ... - Whoa , whoa . I know that you 're eager to crack skulls , but , uh ... don 't start on Baker . He lost his best friend on our last tour . Scott Seaver . I told you about it , Jarod . The , uh , JX-5 leak in the pump room . - Oh , yes . Right . - Seaver botched the retrofit . Which gave the board of inquiry an excuse to try to mothball the ship again . Damn leeches came in here . They went over every piece of paperwork , every inspection record ... tried to haul her out of the water . Finally , it took seven admirals to decide ... the problem was Seaver 's shoddy work . I see . Well , I guess I 'll ease off Baker then . He does know that he 's on this ship for the next six months . [ Jarod ] Where his best friend died . [ Seaver 's Voice ] Oh , my God . ! Baker , help me . ! [ Man ] Surprise inspection , or are you stealing stock tips ? I was just ... getting to know the territory . You play the stock market . Hey , you want to put a kid through college on my salary , you gotta take some chances . Actually , my son picks out all my stocks . He wants to see his tuition keep coming , he better pick ' em right . - Is he a business major ? - He 's a tight end . Got a good brain . Average hands . No scholarship . But I 'll be damned he 's gonna spend his whole life sweating in a hole like this . - You sure this ain 't no inspection ? - Promise . Good . I mean , nothing personal , sir , but , uh ... I 've been turning wrenches down here ... since you and most of this crew were playing kick the can . And what can was I kicking ? All I 'm saying is , uh , you don 't need to go wasting your time ... checking up on Lieutenant Albert Danes . As you were . Thank you , sir . Thank you . [ Man Shouting Commands In Distance ] [ Laughing ] They 're very funny . They still make those ? [ Jarod ] Yeah . But what I don 't understand is why does he wear the eye patch ? Matters of cosmic importance I 'm not prepared to address . Huh . I wanted you here when I call Admiral Mason . You remember Admiral Mason . He signed your recommendation . How could I forget ? [ Autodial Beeps , Line Ringing ] [ Woman ] Admiral Mason 's office . Lieutenant Paula Pratt calling from Long Beach Naval Station . [ Woman ] I 'm sorry . The admiral is on his annual fishing trip to Bimini . [ Pratt ] It 's nice somebody has time for a vacation . - How long will he be gone ? - [ Woman ] Two weeks . And he left strict orders not to be disturbed ... unless , of course , it 's urgent . I 'll call back . - Bummer . - Bummer ? - Melina , she 's busy . ! - That 's whatJoe would say . I don 't care how busy she is . I need to see her . ! Melina , I 'm in a meeting . I know . Hi . But I can 't even get an appointment , and I need to know today if I can go see R.E.M. Rapid eye movements ? - No . It 's a band . - Oh . - Tickets go on sale in an hour . - I told you . I don 't want you going alone . I won 't be alone , Mom . There 'll be 40,000 other people there . [ Sighs ] I am busy . We will talk about this later . Yeah , what else is new ? My daughter . - Yo . What 's up ? - Why won 't you talk to me ? [ Chattering ] How 'd your tattoo come out ? What are you , stalking me ? Not exactly . This police officer stopped by and , uh ... left you this parking ticket . Great . My mom 's gonna go ballistic when she sees this . Not to mention when she finds out you stole her car . But having her go ballistic ... that 's the general idea , isn 't it ? Come on . You can do it . Try it again . Wrap it around your tongue and ... blow . - [ Laughs ] - Yes ! - I can 't believe no one taught you how to blow bubble gum . - I had a lonely childhood . Yeah , join the club . " I.L. Y. ' " Is that another band ? No . Just three letters I want to remember . That 's all . What are your parents going to say ? I don 't care . - My mom hates me , and my dad 's never around . - Your mom does not hate you . - Parents love their children . - Oh , what sitcom are you living in ? [ Laughs ] - [ Bubble Pops ] - [ Man On Recording ] In conclusion ... victim Seaver expired after inhaling theJX-5 toxic gas from the ship 's coolant system . Ice crystals formed in the lungs within 30 seconds , resulting in asphyxiation . Furthermore , additional trauma ... [ Seaver ] Baker . ! Baker . ! Oh , my God . ! - Can 't sleep ? - Sir . At ease , sailor . Sit down . I have nightmares too . About family I 've never seen ... best friends I 've lost . Scott Seaver did not botch that retrofit , sir . And just because some big panel of admirals says so ... Doesn 't mean it 's true . Right . Scott was edgy ... the whole week before it happened . I think he knew there was something wrong with the Monroe ... but he never would 've let us deploy like that . Look ... you don 't gotta worry about me getting tanked or getting into fights anymore , sir . What are you talking about ? I 'm gonna talk to Lieutenant Pratt . I 'm out of here . You 're going to resign . You think that 's going to solve anything ? I watched him die , sir . You know , uh , it hit us out of nowhere . The pipe burst , and the whole place was filling up with JX-5 . Scott told me to get out of there . He said he could handle it . I could 've saved him . But then Nashton sealed the hatch . Nashton . I could see Scott ... through the portal . The gas was starting to get to him . Well , first it makes you crazy . Fills up your lungs and freezes ' em . He couldn 't breathe . Wait . The X.O. was on deck that night . Now , why would Nashton come down here to seal the hatch ? He said the whole ship could 've blown . He said he had to seal the hatch . Some best friend I turned out to be , huh ? He didn 't have to die , sir . I should 've stayed . It should 've been me that died . It wasn 't your fault . [ Nashton ] There 's been a lot of talk about decommissioning her ... but I 'm here to tell you gentlemen that the U.S.S. Monroe ... is a long way from mothballs . This accident ... this tragedy ... happened because of substandard work by a young engineer named Scott Seaver . [ Man ] You believe that sealing that room was the correct course of action . JX-5 gas might have seeped to the rest of the ship . She was a powder keg , ready to blow . If I had had the time to pull him out , I would have done so . As ranking officers , these are the kinds of calls that we 're expected to make . It 's one of the demons we have to live with . I did it to save the ship . You did it ... to save your job . [ Door Opens ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Door Closes ] [ Sydney ] The door was open . - Making house calls now , Syd ? - Where were you today ? Last time I checked , that was a Raines question . What kind of game are you playing with Jarod ? Game ? Hall of Records . You 're starting to ask questions . The way your mother did . Her final session with me ... before she got on the elevator ... she was looking for answers . She didn 't have the means to find them . - I do . - Then you 'll end up like her . Is that a threat ? A warning ... from a friend . Mail call . These seem to have slipped through the cracks . Hey . Personal delivery from the ops officer . Thanks . Letter from my kid at college . Gonna be an engineer . Oh , yeah ? Cornell . Must be expensive . - How 'd you know he was going there ? - Interesting . This is an oxyacetylene weld . Now , Scott Seaver ... he was only rated for gas tungsten welding . If those admirals had known what to look for ... they would 've known that Seaver didn 't botch the retrofit . Nashton forced you to do the work ... after it ruptured , and make it look like Seaver botched it . - Come on . That 's crazy . - Tell that to Scott Seaver . I spoke to his best friend . He said Seaver was nervous the whole week before the deploy . He knew something was wrong , didn 't he ? With all due respect , sir . You 've lost it . Did Nashton threaten your career , or did he threaten your son 's education ? What 's the difference ? Nashton said he was gonna turn the investigating panel on me . I 'd have been kicked out on my ass . No pension , no nothing . And he forced Seaver and me to sign off on that inspection report ... even though theJX-5 line needed work . Brass never knew . And the extra work would have delayed deployment . Or worse , put the Monroe in mothballs . No more Monroe ... no more career for Nashton . So a 20-year-old kid ... chokes to death . - It could 've been your shift . - Oh , come on . Nashton tried to save that poor kid . The pump room was gonna blow . There was no time . There was plenty of time . But Seaver knew the truth . Nashton made sure he died with it . [ Car Alarm Blaring In Distance ] [ Bottle Rattles ] [ Car Alarm Continues Blaring ] [ Car Alarm Stops ] Your mom 's going to miss you . Yeah , well , you can 't miss something that 's not there to begin with . I 'm not going back there ... ever . Okay . You feel like you 're not very important , don 't you ? You feel like ... you were forgotten ... - but you haven 't been . - Yeah , what do you know about it ? I don 't even know who my parents are . I don 't know if they gave me up ... or I was taken from them . But I know ... they 're still out there . Somewhere . I know they love me . - Deep down inside , I know they love me . - [ Sobs ] Just like deep down inside you know your parents love you . My mom just buries herself in work every time my dad 's out to sea . Your mom is responsible for a lot of people 's lives . Maybe in all that , she overlooks the life that 's most important to her , but I know ... she loves you very much . I really miss my dad . " I love you . " I.L.Y. My dad used to put it on all the satellite communications he 'd send us from the subs . You know , they only give you , like , 40 words to say everything you can to each other ... so you gotta abbreviate . I just wish he was here to say it in person . Shh , shh , shh . Shh . Sorry , Mama . I 'm sorry too , honey . - We 'll talk inside . - I 'm sorry . It 's okay . - You have a great kid . - Yeah . I think I should tell her that a little more often . Thanks . [ Engine Starts ] Are you sure that resigning is the right thing to do ? Made up my mind , sir . - Did I say " at ease , " sailor ? - No , sir ! Are you sure it 's the right thing to do , sailor ? - Yes , sir ! - Is that what Scott Seaver would have wanted ? Hope to see you on board ... sailor . At ease . - [ Young Jarod ] What 's that , Sydney ? - [ Young Sydney ] I don 't know . [ Woman Screaming ] No ! No ! No . They 're trying to hurt her . - [ Young Sydney ] Stay here , Jarod . - No ! - No . - [ Man ] Get her on the elevator ! - [ Phone Rings ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Man ] Get the kid out of here ! - [ Young Jarod ] Stop ! - What ? - Jarod has them , doesn 't he ? Has what ? The answers you 're looking for . When I catch him , I 'll just have to find out . You may have that chance . CommanderJarod Forrester is currently serving aboard ... the destroyer U.S.S. Monroe . One of Broots 's routine scans caught it . However , Naval Intelligence may already be onto him . - Naval Intelligence ? - That 's correct . Have my father call the secretary . - Yes , Miss Parker . - Mmm . [ Phone Beeps Off ] [ Young Miss Parker ] Mama . ! [ Sydney ] No . Keep her back . Go back . - [ Young Jarod ] Leave me alone . ! - [ Young Miss Parker ] Mama . ! Yes . I 'd like to purchase some tickets , please . From the secretary . I 'm impressed . You should be . Hell of a day for a deployment . - What 's the good word ? - Surprise . Your knack for discipline has inspired me . I put together one last surprise drill before we deploy . Here . Crank it to maximum . TheJX-5 main ? - That 'll overload the system . - Oh , relax . I 've shut off the pressure . Only the alarm will sound . Think of it as my personal highway to hell . - What 's Jarod wanted for ? - You name it , he 's done it . - After you . - [ Whistling ] Pressure 's building up . Hey , where the hell is everybody ? They 're in the mess . Which is sort of what you 're in now . [ Alarm Blaring ] Hey , o-open the hatch ! Forrester . ! Open the hatch . ! Now . ! Are you starting to feel out of it ? Are you starting to feel disoriented ? - Open the hatch ! - I can 't do that . It could blow the whole ship up . You 're just going to have to die ... to save everybody else . Just like Scott Seaver did . It 's a horrible way to die . Your lungs , they fill up with toxic ice ... and then they freeze . No matter how hard you try ... you won 't be able to breathe . But this is just a judgment call I 'm going to have to make . Think of it as just another demon you have to deal with ... when you 're an officer . Huh , Nashton ? Open the hatch ! That 's an order , Commander ! That 's an order I can 't really follow . You see ... I 'm not an officer on this ship . Think of me as Naval Intelligence . You don 't have anything on me ! [ Jarod On Speaker ] I know that you forced Danes ... to tamper with the evidence after the accident ... to ruin Scott Seaver 's name . You had to preserve the Monroe to save your career ... so you let a 20-year-old kid die . ! Didn 't you , Nashton ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Yes . Yes . God , I 'm sorry . I let him die . [ Gasping ] Now , did you really think that I would put this ship into danger ? That was just laughing gas . So try to laugh a little . [ Panting ] Take him straight to Captain Nagel . And that 's an order . Yes , sir . [ Jarod ] Dismissed . Sir , you have a man impersonating an officer on this ship . I know that . At ease , Lieutenant . There he is . - We were talking about Commander Forrester . - Jarod ? - Yes . - Jarod is Naval Intelligence . - I plan to see to it he gets a medal . - Where is he ? Well , he was ordered back to Norfolk by the secretary no less . If you hurry , you might still catch him . [ Horn Honks ] The nearest ocean is 1,756 miles from here . That 's just the way I like it .

 Who are you ? When your father was in need , I came . Christina is my given name . Christina ? - But you 're not real . - Real enough for you to see what evil awaits The Legacy . Your father did a father slay but once again he comes this way . Who are you talking about ? Who comes this way ? One whose daughter was beguiled now seeks to steal a little child . Deny him this and you compel his soul to burn in fiery hell . Beware the wrath . The hell was that ? I 'm not sure . A warning . Something or someone is coming . Since the beginning oh time mankind has existed between the world oh light and the world oh darkness . Our secret society has been here horever protecting others hrom the creatures who inhabit the shadows and the night . Known only to the initiated by our true name The Legacy . All I can tell you is what I experienced . I remember hearing the music , speaking to this woman , Christina . And then just as I came in , that the window shattered . But it isn 't broken . - Pretty weird , huh ? - No kidding . - So who is Christina ? - My father spoke of her . He claimed that whenever he needed her , she was there . She 's a seer who can foretell the future and see the past . And according to legend , she 's been around over 300 years . Three hundred years ? Are you serious ? Okay , what does this Christina see ? Someone my father killed has come back from the grave . - To do what ? - That 's what I intend to find out . The Journal oh a Ghosthunter ? Maybe my father 's diaries will give us a clue . Or maybe you could just ask Christina ? - It 's not that simple . - Why is that ? You don 't find her , she finds you . And what else do you think of when you look at a painting like this ? It doesn 't look very real . No , that 's true . It doesn 't look real , does it ? - Yes , it does . - Really ? That 's interesting , Katherine . What makes you think so ? Because an artist paints what she feels , what 's real to her . - Very good . Did everyone hear that ? - No . Would you like to repeat that so everyone can hear ? What makes a painting real is if the person who paints it paints what they feel in their heart . Excellent . All right , class , let 's move along . Ticktack , sweet Kat . Come to visit ? Come to chat ? - Who are you ? - Christina . I 've been expecting you . No way . How could you expect somebody you don 't even know ? It 's true , it 's true . Waiting here for only you . - But why ? - Because it is our destiny . I 'm for you , and you 're for me . Do you always talk this silly way ? Always , never , it 's all the same . Seeing your future is why I came . - You can see my future ? - Clear as night . Night ? That 's not so clear . It is for me . Child of Rachel , child of Ruth the time has come to tell the truth . Beware of evil from the past the first that comes to take the last . - What did you just do ? - Mark you now , your soul to keep listen for me when you sleep . An evil vessel soon will be brought back to The Legacy . Katherine , come along . Coming . - Katherine . - Yes , ma 'am . I 'm coming . Oh , Father Callaghan , welcome back . Thank you , Dominick . Philip ? My God . What are you doing here ? When 'd you get in ? Why didn 't you call ? I 'm only just passing through . Officially , I 'm in San Francisco on Church business . Oh , yeah , and unofficially ? I 'm here to give Derek this . " To Derek , my son . To be opened in the event of my death . " Where did you get this ? In the monastery I 've been staying . St. Alban 's , Kilkerry . They 've been renovating the cloisters . I recognized your father 's handwriting the minute I set eyes on it . I got it here as quick as I could . I remember he stayed there just before we met in Peru for the last time . And he never mentioned this letter ? No . Just like my father to leave secrets and tell no one . - Sounds like it runs in the family . - What is it ? - I 'm not sure . Maybe this will tell us . That 's strange . It looks almost Abyssinian . Well , there 's no hinge , no lock , no seams . Feels like there 's something inside , though . It could be starting to disintegrate . Perhaps . Why don 't you see if you can find out what it 's made of . Sounds good . - Nice to have you back . - Actually , I 'm only here for the week . Of course . So there 's no chance that I can persuade you to decipher this ? There 's something really odd about these characters . I guess I 'll give it a go . Okay . We learned so much about Rembrandt and Picasso and some guy who paints soup cans . Whose paintings did you like the best ? Mary Cassatt . She was an impressionist , just like Renoir . That 's right , and she 's an American too . Just like you . The only problem was people back then were so stupid . - How 's that ? - They thought women weren 't supposed to do that kind of thing . You 're right , that is pretty stupid . But Mary Cassatt just didn 't believe them . - Who told you all this ? - Miss McHugh . Well , Miss McHugh sounds pretty smart , doesn 't she ? So is Christina . - Christina ? Is that one of your friends ? - She lives in one of the paintings . In a painting ? Yeah , with a unicorn and lots of other great stuff . - I 'm sleepy . - Yeah . Go on , hop into bed . Now , this Christina , are we talking real or imaginary ? Real . She can even see the future . And did she see your future ? Sort of . She said be careful . Something from the past is coming back . Well , it 's not Sanskrit or Sumerian . Nothing recognizable . But there 's something uncomfortably familiar about it . What 's that ? It 's my father 's journal . I thought it could help us . Derek , listen , I 'm not sure I 'm gonna be much use here . I mean , this sort of thing takes a lot of time . I know . The effort is much appreciated . Philip , it 's good to have you back . It 's strange , but you have no idea how many times we could have used you . How has it been in Ireland ? Divided as ever , despite the promises . It 's really upsetting when they use the love of God to generate so much hate . - Derek Rayne . - Derek it 's Rachel . - Something 's happened to Kat . - Tell me what 's going on . Well , you know that encounter that you had the other day with that woman , Christina ? Yesterday , Kat went on a hield trip with her class to the art museum and when I was putting her to bed , she was telling me about it and she mentioned the same name , Christina . She was almost falling asleep on her feet , so I ... I mean , I ... I 've just let her sleep . But the thing is , there 's this strange mark behind her left ear . - Describe it . - It sort of looks like a C. Let me talk to her . Well , that 's the thing , Derek . I can 't wake her . - I think I 'll come over right away . - Great . Baby ? Kat , honey ? - How long has she been asleep ? - Nearly 12 hours . She doesn 't have a fever , her vital signs are normal . - I just ... I can 't wake her up . - Show me the mark . Omega . The last and most powerful letter in the Greek alphabet . You said she spoke to Christina . What did she say ? Only that she could see the future , that Kat should be careful that something was coming back . - Just what she said to me . Did Kat say where in the museum she saw Christina ? Not really . She mentioned a painting , a unicorn . Stay with her . If she wakes up , try to keep her awake . - I 'll be back as soon as I can . - Yeah , Derek . How 's it going ? The translation , making any progress ? Not much . They say talking is good for the soul . That 's what they say . Even a priest needs to confess . You 've changed . - Have I ? - Yeah . What happened ? My brother Michael , he died . - I 'm so sorry , Philip . - It 's funny , you know . He was the one who would have made a great priest . I was the sinner . I mean , he married a good woman , had five beautiful kids good Catholic family , but he was always trying to help people to do the right thing , you know ? How did he die ? Business in Manchester . An IRA car bomb injured a girl on a bike . He went in to help . The second blast killed them both . What sort of God allows this to happen ? - You know there 's no simple answer . - I know nothing . Ever since the day this happened , I 've been asking myself : " How do I fight for a God who would let this be ? " I mean , if this is a sample of his justice and mercy then I 'm afraid I have to pass . Like the father comes the son Derek Rayne , the anointed one . Christina . Know yourself and you will find that I cannot be far behind . Then you must know why I 've come . The mark on Katherine Corrigan 's neck . The mark protects her during sleep from one who wants her soul to keep . The day of reckoning , the chosen waif ... - The day of reckoning ? - Mistake not your father 's fight . The evil he killed is alive tonight . Long thought dead , he comes this way . Prepare yourself for judgment day . No ! Have you seen this crack ? I was right . It 's starting to disintegrate . Yeah . Have you spoken to Philip ? Not really . Maybe you should say something to him . He needs a friend to talk to . Well , I tried . Last night , after everybody called it quits I stopped by his room with a couple of bottles of stout sort of an old ritual we used to have . Stout ? You mean beer ? More like ale with an attitude . Anyway , he kind of shut me out . Said he wasn 't interested in talking . That 's the trouble with you macho men always keeping everything inside . Hey , this can 't be right . What 's that ? Well , the spectrographic analysis of the metal shows a titanium alloy , only the valences are off . Well , maybe it 's breaking down quicker than we thought . Let 's see if this acid wash shows anything . Have a look at this . It 's Latin . Something " evil . " " Beware the source of evil . " Nice . Winston Rayne 's words to live by . You know , there 's no point in carrying on with this tonight . It 's getting late , anyways . - Derek can look at it in the morning . - Okay . - See you in the morning . - Yeah , have a good snooze . You saw her ? What did she say ? That the mark you found , the omega she put it there to induce a kind of dream state . L ... I can 't do this again . You have to . The evil you 've attracted has not come by chance . You must face whatever it is , and you must be strong . Strong ? Do you know what it takes to lose your husband and son and keep on going ? To know that your daughter might be in danger and all you can do is wait ? No , I don 't need strong , Derek . I need to know why . Why her ? Why me ? Rachel , listen to me . There are no easy answers . I understand your anxiety , your frustration but you don 't have a choice . - You have to wait and fight . - No . I have waited long enough . I want my daughter and my life back . I can 't go on living just ... When any moment , it all could end . I ... Some malignant force could come and take my only child the way it 's taken everything else that I have ever loved . I need this to stop . Of course . And it will , but not right now . You want life to be fair ? Well , it 's not . You want God to make things right ? Well , he won 't without your help . It 's up to us to act . And we have to act now . Nick ? Don 't try to get up . Give yourself a chance . Something 's in here . Well , that or a little too much ale with attitude . No , I 'm serious . Something 's in here besides us . Well , like what ? I don 't know . Didn 't you feel it ? - No . - Well , it wasn 't my imagination . Well , what was it , then ? I don 't know . But I 'm gonna recheck security . Well , wait for me . As you lie asleep today two to wake you come this way . When they enter , you 'll awake and go with them for safety 's sake . Kat ? Honey ? Baby , can you hear me ? Yes . Hello , you . Guess who 's here . Derek . And he wants us to go with him . Go ? Where ? Back to The Legacy . Just for a few days . - I can 't . - Why not ? I have to finish my art project . I promised Miss McHugh . Well , you can finish it . We 'll just take it with us , huh ? What 's important right now , Katherine , is that you get up , okay ? You cold ? Where 's Christina ? In the museum . I was there . And I spoke with her about you . But she was here just now , before you came in . Derek , how about you go downstairs and just give us a couple minutes by ourselves alone . Of course . Katherine . Philip . - Kat ? - There you are . They said you were here . I 've been searching and searching . It 's barely dawn . When did you get here ? Late last night . I came with my mom . Derek brought us . Everybody else is asleep , but I wasn 't tired . What are you doing ? Trying to help Derek solve this puzzle . Only , I 'm not doing a very good job , am I ? I like puzzles . Maybe I could help you . Unfortunately , it 's not that kind of puzzle . - Then what kind is it ? - The impossible kind . And I 've just hit another dead end . You sound sad . - Do I ? - It 's like my teacher says : " Any time things look bad , all you have to do is look in a mirror . " - And why is that ? - Wait , I 'll show you . Because a mirror can turn everything around . Okay . You 've proved your point . Now off you go . Oh , my God . Out of the mouths of babes . - How you feeling this morning ? - I 'm all right except for this . It 's gone . We put the container in this case , right ? - Right . - It 's a locked case . How can it be gone ? We both ran a security check last night . - Find Derek . I 'll look around . - All right . Yes . Alex ? Where 'd she go ? - You 're certain you left it here ? - Absolutely . The case is still locked . This was something that belonged to my father . I know , and I 'm sorry . But the control room is a secured area . No one could break in without tripping the fail-safe systems . What were the words you found ? " Beware the source of evil . " Find Alex and make a thorough search of the house . - I want it found . You understand ? - Perfectly . I 've gotta talk to Philip . Derek . I was about to come looking for you . - Any progress ? - The whole text . So quickly ? How ? Well , at first I thought it was Abyssinian but your father actually wrote the characters in ancient Aramaic . The thing that threw me was that he wrote them backwards using a mirror . He didn 't want it falling into the wrong hands . Is it that serious ? Yes . " This is my confession . I make it of my own free will so that I may atone in part for the unpardonable sin I have committed . " You wanted to see me ? Yes . - Please sit down . - What 's wrong ? There is something you need to know . Something that may come between us . Tell me . Whatever it is , I 'm sure we can work it out , Derek . Shortly before he died , my father killed a man . Someone who made a bargain with the dark side . The man had two daughters . One skilled in the black arts the other an innocent with a child of her own . A girl . - Is this a joke ? - No , Rachel , it 's not . The man 's name was Joshua Cantwell . My grandfather ? That 's my mother and Aunt Rebecca . - Where 'd you get this ? - The archives among my father 's papers . I 've seen it before but I never knew where it came from until I saw this . Nick faxed it back to us when he was down in Kingston to help you settle your aunt 's estate . So you 've known about this all this time and just haven 't bothered to tell me , huh ? Until tonight , I didn 't understand the full significance . Which is what ? After my father tracked down and killed Joshua Cantwell he reduced his body into a fine ash because he feared that the evil force that dominated Cantwell 's body would find a way to rise again . He placed the remains in a sealed vessel and left it in a monastery in Ireland among his confession . Rachel , you must believe me . I had no idea . Besides Cantwell himself my father killed one more person . His daughter . Mistaking one sister for the other he killed your mother . No . Never . This ... This can 't be . This ... I don 't believe you . My mother ... This can 't be ! How could this be happening ? Don 't you see that it 's impossible for both of us ? Unless we 're honest , we have nothing . What makes you expect that I could ever forgive you or your father or this Legacy for what happened ? Because all of this , the death of your husband and son the incident in Ireland , you joining us here can no longer be seen as an accident . You were meant to find your way to The Legacy . There 's no question . You are part of us . How can this be happening ? I mean I remember so little about my mother or my childhood . I remember too much of mine . Maybe you can accept this , Derek but I can 't . I won 't . I have no choice . I must . Alex . Who 's there ? Mom ? Christina ? Is that you ? Her pulse is weak . Breathing , shallow . - What happened here ? - I don 't know . But last night , after I locked up , something , I don 't know what it was physically knocked me down the stairs . He 's here , isn 't he ? - Who ? - Joshua Cantwell . My grandfather . The sealed vessel that Alex was working on she said that the alloy was beginning to disintegrate . He 's broken out . First he attacked you , then Alex . Oh , my God . Kat . Kat ? Kat ! She 's gone ! Oh , my God . She 's gone . - Check the back of the house . - Meet you downstairs . - Did you find her ? - No , nothing . Philip 's checking the grounds . Time of trial , time of tears time to face down all your fears . My daughter , where is she ? There is much we need to know . We don 't have time for this . When a spirit has things to say only fools would walk away . If you want to save Kat , you must listen to her . Now place your hand thus and so . Round the table we will go . Spirit listening , hear our plea raise your voice and speak through me . One by one , each by each hear our prayer , we do beseech . Speak to us . Speak to us . Speak . Speak . Speak . I hear you . What do you want with me ? - Who speaks ? - My name is Ruth . Mother . Rachel , how I 've missed you . Mother . Why have you come back here ? Wrongly killed by Winston Rayne , I 've come to warn you your daughter is in grave danger . I don 't understand . Years ago , my father traded the innocent souls of his female heirs for immortality . My sister went willingly but I ran away gave up everything , even my life , to save you from him . But he was killed by the ghosthunter his evil spirit locked away . And tonight he 's free . He has Kat . What ... ? What will he do with her ? To restore his bargain with the dark side he must offer up your daughter 's soul at the stroke of 12 or return to dust forever . Then he 's desperate . Kat 's his only chance . We ... We 've gotta find her . We 're running out of time . Christina ? Quickly , go and let me be . Find the child and set her free . Set her free . Set her free . The hologram . Oh , my God , Kat . - Let her go ! - Never ! She 's mine . Just as you should have been . No , you can 't have her . - I won 't let you ! - Rachel , no ! No ! Child of wisdom , child of light wake and rise this very night . - Silence ! Mom ? No ! No ! The hologram is breached ! Cut the power . The switch is at the top of the stairs . Joshua Cantwell ! - Kat ? - She is mine ! Rachel , call her to you now ! - Kat , come here now . - No ! - Don 't listen to him ! - The power is mine . By the power of God , I command you ! - Release that girl now ! - God has no power over me . My pact is not with him . You cannot sell what you do not own ! - That girl is free . Let her go ! - She is mine . Who will deny me ? You ? Come , then . Take her . Kat , go now ! Mommy ! Derek ! It 's time . Time we drew things to their ultimate conclusion . Derek , fight the pain and doubt . Draw your sword and drive him out . All that 's holy , give me strength ! Does that hurt ? Let me help you . No ! No ! Kat , come to me ! No ! - Don 't let him get me . - Come to me now ! No . Leave me alone ! No ! Mommy ! Derek .

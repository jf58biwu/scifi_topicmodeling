 Hey , I ... Hey , I was playing that . Yeah , I just went to go take a whiz and now I 'm back . - Even good guys blow it . - Damn ! You got a problem ? It 's my game . I was playing here . Were you , pinhead ? Now you 're not . Maybe you didn 't hear me right . I said it was my game . It 's his game . Man , I 'd step aside if I were you . All right . You guys wanna play a game ? We 'll play a game . I go first . Oh , man , you shouldn 't have done that . Why ? What 's he gonna do ? So , is it my turn now ? I 'm not wasting my time . I feel a new record coming on , man . Both eardrums are ruptured . Cataracts over both eyes . Probably heat-induced . Probably ? Looks like his heart was cooked right in his chest . I have to admit I 've never seen that kind of localized tissue damage . Well , there is extensive charring along the sternum , with concomitant rib fractures , consistent with electrocution or exposure to high-voltage current . But I see no point of contact . Best I can figure is the lightning struck the car , killed the kid on contact . Were there contact wounds on any of the other five victims ? I 'd have to look at my notes . It 's clear to me what killed these kids . - Lightning . - Well , yeah . Are you aware that something like 60 people die from lightning strikes each year ? - And five happened here in Connerville . - lt 's statistically improbable ... There are only four deaths . Stan , you don 't have to defend your work . Give us a minute , please ? Yeah , sure. I 'll be in my office . My name 's Teller . Sheriff 's department . I got word there was an fbi investigation . - Yes , I 'm Agent Scully . - l know who you are . I just wonder what the hell you 're doin ' here . These deaths match other cases of fatalities attributed to lightning , with the same inconclusive forensic evidence . Do you know anything about lightning , Agent Scully ? Yes , I know a little . That lightning kills several people a year , at home in the shower , or on the phone ? That people have seen it dancing on the ground like balls ? The scientists will tell you that they don 't know what makes lightning work . No , I didn 't know that . I know that , because I have breakfast with those scientists every morning . - l don 't understand . - That 's as clear as glass ( ! ) Do you know what we manufacture here ? What one of our little local commodities is ? We make lightning . Down at the Astadourian Lightning Observatory . 100 ionized rods pointing up into the sky , designed to stimulate lightning . I didn 't know that either . You didn 't do your homework , did you ? You 're doing work that 's already been done . With all due respect , these autopsies don 't quite add up . - Based on what ? - Based on my opinion as a medical doctor . Then , based on your medical opinion , if you had to give one , what do you think this boy died of ? Since there is no other explanation , right now I 'd have to concur with the coroner . That lightning is the most probable cause of death . And I won 't have you or anyone else suggesting otherwise to this boy 's family . - Feel free to jump in anytime . - Why ? You were doing just fine . - Do you have a theory on this ? - l just don 't think it 's lightning . Mulder , wait . What are you expecting to find here ? - l don 't know yet . - Would you stop for a second , please ? After everything we 've just been through , after all that we 've just seen , I hope you don 't think this is to do with government conspiracies or UFOs . No evidence so far indicates either possibility . What are you looking for ? Just cos a forensic profile isn 't cut and dry doesn 't mean it 's not true . Teller 's explanation works for you ? The only scientific conclusion is that Jack Hammond was killed by lightning . Then this lightning is more predictable than Teller realizes . It has a definite preference for the type of person it strikes . - What ? - Look at the files . Look at all the other victims . They 're all male , aged 17 to 21 , just like Jack Hammond . At least let 's go see where Jack Hammond was killed . Maybe we 'll find something we both can agree on . Police found Hammond in his car at 17 minutes past midnight . The entire electrical system was shorted out . All the circuitry and wiring had melted . Looks like he was trying to get away in a big hurry . Get away from what ? What time was Jack Hammond 's last pizza delivery ? Sometime between 11 and 11 : 30 . Why ? Well , all these stores would have been closed by 11 . Except maybe this one . - Seven , eight , nine ... - Excuse me ? Ten ... Eleven ... What 's your name ? Zero . Zero , do you mind if we talk for a minute ? What for ? I 'm with the fbi . All right . - Were you working here last night ? - Sure . Every night . Do you recognize this person ? Nah , never seen him . Why don 't you take a closer look ? He was here between 11 and 11 : 30 . He was killed in the parking lot . That was his car . So , if you were standing here at this counter , you must have seen it happen . Oh , that was him ! Last I saw , the dude fed a bunch of quarters into this one . Then the ambulance shows up . Before the ambulance showed up , did you notice anything unusual outside ? It 's hard to tell. I mean , the place gets pretty loud . Kinda hard to hear much of anything . Did you notice anyone else around who might have seen something ? I can 't ... - l don 't really remember . - Scully , take a look at this . - What ? - What were the names of the other victims ? Corey Hufferd , Darin Oswald , Burke Roberts and Billy ... Darin Oswald . What 's his middle name ? - Darin Peter . Why ? - DPO . Darin Peter Oswald . Of the five victims , wasn 't he the only one to survive ? - Yes . - Well , he was here last night . Hey , Mrs Kiveat . - God , Darin , you scared me . - What ? - Where 's Frank ? - He 's out on a tow . - ls there anything I can help you with ? - No . We 're supposed to go to dinner . Are you hungry ? I can get you something to eat. I gotjelly donuts . - No , thank you . - Are you sure ? They 're from yesterday , but they 're still good. I had one . Hey ... Mrs Kiveat ... Hey , about those things that I said yesterday ... Sorry I 'm late , hon . I had to tow that poor pizza delivery kid 's car . Oh , hey , Darin. I just got a call on the radio . Some people are coming to see ya . They say they 're with the fbi . So this is the dude that died , huh ? It 's pretty harsh , man . - How 'd it happen ? - They say he was struck by lightning . Yeah ... that happens . Right outside the video arcade . Not a cloud in the sky from what we can tell . You were there last night , weren 't you ? Broke your own record , too . Yeah . Well , you must have seen something . Oh , no , man . When I 'm into my game , man , I 'm there , you know ? It 's like a nuclear explosion could go off , right ? And I wouldn 't even notice . Can I ask you a personal question ? Yeah . Do you consider yourself a lucky person ? - Me ? - Yeah . I don 't think so . Of all the people hit by lightning , you 're the only one to survive . Don 't you think you 're lucky ? Well , I guess if you look at it like that , you could be right . - l could be considered lucky . - Mulder ? - Yeah ? - What 's in your pocket ? - What happened ? - l don 't know . Itjust got hot all of a sudden . Bummer . I 'm gonna go now . - Thanks for your help . - Yeah. I 'll see ya . Teenagers have been into piercing and sadomasochism , and , um , rebellion extremism . That 's something I think is skipped over ... Quit fooling ' with the remote . .. and I used to sleep in a belt at night ... Why do you want to watch that stuff ? They 're all a bunch of losers . At least they 're on TV. I don 't see you on TV . Manners don 't cost , Darin . They 're free . What girl 's gonna want a belching ' fool like you ? - Darin ? - Maybe you 'd be surprised . Dude ? You won 't believe who came by today . - Let me guess . The fbi ? - How did you know ? - They came by the garage . - How did they find you ? - You tell me . You must have said something . - No , man ! I didn 't say squat ! Wait up ! Come on , man ! You know I wouldn 't do that to you . I think you wanna be someplace else right now . - Cos I 'm in the mood for a little barbecue . - No , man , not the cows again . Come on , don 't . Don 't do this . Not now . All right , I 'm listening . - l 'm ready . - Don 't do it , man ! I 'm ready , so come on down ! - l 'm outta here ! - Come on down ! Come and get me ! I 'm right here ! Come on , man ! I 'm waitin ' ! Come on , man ! Talk to me ! Come on ! Dude ? Are you OK , man ? Excellent . Have that faxed to my office . Right away if you can . Thank you , Dean. I appreciate it . What happened here , Sheriff ? Three dead cows . - How do you think they died ? - Lightning . I just got off with Dean at the observatory , which is about a mile through those trees . Did they report lightning last night ? They can detect every flash of lightning on this planet . Did you know that ? - Each one emits radio waves at the exact ... - The Schumann resonance . Eight cycles per second . You can pick it up on any transistor radio . See that , Sheriff ? I did my homework . Not much question that lightning killed these cows last night . Just like it killed Jack Hammond the night before last . Well , that 's certainly the way it looks . Let me show you something else . It 's right over here . You see this ? You know what this is ? It looks like a fulgurite . That only happens with lightning . When sandy soil fuses into glass from the heat of a discharge . How much more proof do you need ? I 'd say your business here is finished . - Mulder , I 'd have to say I think he 's right . - That we 're wasting time chasing lightning ? - Look at the evidence . What else could it be ? - l don 't know yet . This is the first lightning strike I 've ever seen that left behind a footprint . Here we go . Considering it 's a partial imprint , there 's a lot of information here . That 's great . Now can you make me a little cherub that squirts water ? The tread looks like a standard military boot . Men 's . - Size eight and a half . - Eight and a half ? That 's pretty impressive . Well , it says it right here on the bottom . But I may have something even better . When I cleaned the imprint to take the mold , I found trace amounts of a viscous substance actually embedded in the fulgurite . What is it ? Well , I 'd have to conduct a chemical analysis to be sure , but it looks like antifreeze . - Darin Oswald . - But why ? - And how ? - l don 't know , but let 's see if the shoe fits . - Jeez ! You think you own the whole road ? - God ! You jerk ! Dude , what 's happening ? - What 's going on ? - l don 't know . Nothin ' . You know , I 've been thinking . First time for everything . Oh , damn ! ABS brakes . I 'm thinkin ' we should go somewhere . Get out of this hole . Maybe check out Las Vegas . You could do some serious damage someplace like that . I 'm not going to Las Vegas . I 'm not going anywhere without Mrs Kiveat . Why do you think she 'll wanna go anywhere with you ? She failed you , remember ? She thinks you 're a retard . Forget school , man . I 'm talkin ' about proving my love . - How you gonna do that ? - By letting her know how I feel . - How all I ever think about is being with her . - Wake up , dude . There 's another slight problem . She 's married to your boss . - Maybe I could fry him . - Dude , he 's your boss . Not if he 's dead , he won 't be . Are you high ? With the fbi hangin ' around ? Just forget about it , OK ? You can 't compete . Frank 's good-looking , he 's got his own shop . Plus , he fixes things , instead ofjust smashing ' stuff up . A woman like that ... wants someone special . - l 'm special . - Right . And I 'm gonna show her just how special I am . That was a good one ! That was a good one ! Come on , man . Let 's go check it out . Darin ain 't worth much - l 'm the first one to say it . But he wouldn 't hurt a soul . What kind of trouble is he in , anyway ? Can we have a few minutes , Mrs Oswald ? Thank you . - Mulder ? - Yeah ? - We 've got a size match . - Eight and a half ? Yeah . But it still doesn 't prove that he killed Jack Hammond . - l 'm surprised you haven 't read that issue . - Oh , I have . April is the cruelest month , but mine didn 't come with this . It was between Miss April and Women of the Ivy League . - Who is she ? - lt looks like it 's from a yearbook photo . See ? There 's a yearbook in Darin 's closet . Her name is Sharon Kiveat . Kiveat . The garage where Darin works is called Kiveat Auto Body . What happened ? Kid got center-punched . Just got his license . He 's pretty bad off . Man , that 's rough . You guys ready for me to start clearing ' the road ? I 'm just directing traffic . Check with the deputy . Hey , pal , are you OK ? You don 't look so good . Somebody get the EMS guys ! - Easy . You 'll be OK . - What happened ? He just collapsed . Pulse is thready. I 'll get the kit . It 's all right , buddy . Here we go . Where you goin ' ? What are you doin ' ? Let 's get outta here . I got one ... two ... three . - Give me 300 joules . - Already charged . No , it 's not . Something 's not working here . Get the backup . Hang in there , buddy . Don 't worry , Mr Kiveat . I 've seen how they do it on TV . Wait , we got a rhythm . How the hell ... ? Rescue 911 . Let me give you a hand with that . Thank you . Mrs Kiveat ? My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm with the fbi . I know this is a hard time , but I 'd like to ask some questions . You were in my husband 's garage yesterday . Yes . - l 'm sorry ... - l 'd like to ask you about Darin Oswald . He was at the scene of the accident , wasn 't he ? Please , I need to see my husband . I just talked to one of the EMS workers . He was rattled . - Why ? - Frank Kiveat 's electrocardiogram . Take a look at this . See that spike ? It indicates that electrical intervention started his heart . Except the defibrillator wouldn 't charge . The paddles were dead . - How did he explain this ? - He didn 't . All he saw was Darin Oswald touching Kiveat 's chest . I 've been going over Oswald 's chart . There 's something I want you to take a look at . He was admitted five months ago in cardiac arrest . Respiratory failure , with class-three burns on his back and scalp . Resuscitated after 21 minutes ... Hang on , this is odd . His blood test showed acute hypokalemia . Yeah , what is that ? A severe chemical imbalance characterized by high sodium and low potassium levels . - Electrolytes , right ? - Yeah . What do electrolytes do ? They generate the electrical impulses in our bodies . Every time our heart beats ... lt 's a leap , but what if Oswald 's electrolyte imbalance lets him generate electricity at levels higher than normal ? It doesn 't work like that . Unless his body is abnormally conductive . If that heel print is Oswald 's , he conducted millions of volts into the ground and just walked away . - You think he 's some kind of lightning rod ? - No , that he is lightning . And we 've got to get to him before he strikes again . Darin ? Darin ! - Darin . - Don 't you touch me , man ! - Relax , Darin . - Don 't you touch me ! We just want to talk to you , that 's all . Just ask you a few more questions . I didn 't do anything . How many times do I have to say it ? I don 't know how all those people died . Why did you run when you saw us ? I was taking a walk . Now , that 's not against the law , is it ? Anyway , you guys should be giving me a medal. I mean , I saved my boss 's life . - We 're not so sure . - Why ? Who told you that ? Who you been talkin ' to ? You been talkin ' to Zero ? He the one who told you that ? - What 'd he say ? - Not much . - Except that he 's a hero . - How 'd he say he revived Kiveat ? CPR . He claims he paid attention in health class . I don 't think he just resuscitated Frank Kiveat . He set the whole thing up . - Causing a heart attack ? - You see what he did to my phone ? So we charge him with assaulting a cellular phone ? - We should run lab tests on this kid . - Look where we are . We don 't have the capability or the time to perform those tests . And , without a confession , we can only keep him in custody for 72 hours . I can think of one other person who might be able to help us . Mrs Kiveat ? Please , I can 't do this now . I 'm just leaving for the hospital . Darin Oswald 's in custody , Mrs Kiveat . We arrested him this afternoon . But we can 't press criminal charges without your help . is it OK if we come in ? I teach remedial reading at the high school . Darin was my student . How would you describe your relationship with him ? Well , I 'm not blind . I knew he had a crush on me , but ... I felt sorry for him. I thought he was just ... ltjust seemed he had more than his share of bad luck . Did you get him the job at your husband 's garage ? Yeah . And then about six months ago I started getting these phone calls . - Someone would call and then hang up . - How did you know it was Darin ? The way he looked at me in the garage . The phone calls made me feel the same way. I just knew . When did you first suspect that Darin was involved in more than prank calls ? - He told me . - He confessed to killing those people ? No , but he ... he told me that he had ... powers . - Dangerous powers . - When was this ? - Right after the last boy was killed . - Jack Hammond ? See , at first I didn 't believe him . I thought he was just mouthing off . - But after what happened today ... - Did you tell anyone ? Who would have believed me ? And I was afraid . I was afraid of what he might do to me , and what he would ... do to my husband . Well , you don 't have to be afraid anymore . You and your husband are safe as long as we can count on your testimony . - Where 's Oswald ? - l sent him home . - You released him ? When ? - After I read your arrest report . I 'm gonna go call Sharon Kiveat . " Suspicion of homicide by emission of direct electric current . " You don 't believe this ? I believe that Darin Oswald was involved somehow in those four deaths . And that it was irresponsible for you to let him go . Let 's get this straight . This kid 's throwing lightning bolts ? - ln effect . - " ln effect . " There is no scientific basis for that claim . It 's speculation . No hard evidence , no proof ... You said yourself , science can 't explain how lightning works . Mrs Kiveat 's not home . She 's on her way to the hospital . Dude ? Come on , man ! Where are ya ? What are you doing , man ? I said I didn 't tell ' em ! What the ... ? I didn 't say nothin ' , man ! I swear ! Why are you doin ' this , man ? We 're buddies ! Excuse me , miss . Call Security . Have them deny entry to the hospital to everyone except emergency personnel . Sharon ? What is it ? - We need you to come with us right away . - Why ? What 's wrong ? Darin Oswald . He was released from custody . But how ? How could that happen ? You said not to worry , that we were safe . We don 't have much time . Come with us and we 'll explain . The doctor said my husband cannot leave this room. I 'm not leaving him here . - l 'll stay with him . You go with Agent Scully . - No . Sharon , please . He 's here . He 's dead . - Oh , my God ! - How many other access points to this floor ? - Other than the elevator , the stairway . - Stay with them . - Mulder ... - l 'm going after Oswald . - Mrs Kiveat ? - Darin ... - Don 't move . - Where is she ? I said , don 't move . Darin ... - Mrs Kiveat ? - Stop. I 'm warning you . All right , come with me , please , Mrs Kiveat , cos there 's some things ... - Stuff I need to tell you . - l want you to step back inside that room . - Are you comin ' with me ? - She 's not going anywhere with you , Darin . - l can hurt you . - l can hurt you , too . You have three seconds . - One ... - Now I 'm done fooling ' around now ! Stop it ! I 'll go with you . OK ? If that 's what you want , we 'll go . Just ... Stop it . Sharon , we can work this all out right here . No , we can 't . All right . All right , then . You were the only person that was ever nice to me , you know that ? I mean ... Hey , you remember that first day in class when you wore that green dress with the yellow flowers on it ? And when you stood in front of the window you could almost see through it ? Where are we going ? - Where are you taking me ? - l don 't know . Anywhere you wanna go . I got money from the cash machine , you know ? Plus , you know , we can take any car you want . You know , you just take your pick , you know . I mean , we can take an Accord or a Maxima . Do you like any of those ? Or , you know , if you don 't wanna go Japanese , you know ... How about a Taurus ? No , you 're right . You know , all these cars suck . We 'll just boost one of ' em for right now , and then ... we 'll trade it later . Just take it easy , Mrs Kiveat , all right ? No . - Mrs Kiveat ... - Hey , come over here . Come on over here ! Mrs Kiveat ? Mrs Kiveat , where are you ? Come on now ! I said I 'd take care of you ! What else did you want ? I 'd have given you anything ! Anything you wanted ! - Mrs Kiveat ! - Hey , son , turn around . Let 's go. I don 't know what kind of trouble you 're up to , - but I want some answers . - No ! I want some answers ! Where is she ? Come on , now ! You 're pissin ' me off ! Teller , get out of there ! Tell me where she is ! I just got off the phone with the coroner . He 's ruling Teller 's death accidental . Lightning ? What do the scientists at the observatory say ? They also reported lightning last night . I talked to the DA . He has no idea how to begin building a case . - What about the tests ? - The results came in five minutes ago . And ? Nothing unusual was detected , Mulder . The electrolytes , the blood gas levels , brain-wave activity , based on the signs of all the gathered data ... Darin Oswald is a perfectly normal , perfectly healthy kid . You believe that , Scully ? Neither do I . Visiontext Subtitles : Claire Bates I made this ! US english

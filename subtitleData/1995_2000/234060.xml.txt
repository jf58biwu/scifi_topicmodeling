 [ Man Chattering ] [ Woman ] THAT 'S A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE . [ Man ] REALLY ? NO , I 'M PRETTY MUCH OF A HOMEBODY . BUT ALL THAT CHANGED , JUST FROM YOUR WORDS , THE WAY YOU SAW THINGS . I KNEW I WANTED TO MEET YOU . WELL , I HOPE YOU 'RE NOT TOO DISAPPOINTED . LAUREN , WE HAVE A REAL CONNECTION , WHICH IS RARE . MOST MEN DON 'T FEEL THAT WAY . MOST MEN DON 'T KNOW WHAT THEY 'RE MISSING . - [ Nervous Giggle ] - WHAT ? I CAN 'T BELIEVE THIS . I-I MEAN , I CAN 'T BELIEVE THAT AFTER THREE MONTHS , WE FINALLY MEET IN PERSON , AND YOU 'RE- - I DON 'T KNOW . I 'M JUST REALLY ENJOYING MYSELF TONIGHT . OH , NO . OH . HERE . LET ME HELP YOU . MY SISTER GAVE IT TO ME . FOR GOOD LUCK , I GUESS . KIND OF DOPEY , HUH ? I MEAN , A CLOVERLEAF . HOW BLATANT CAN YOU GET ? IT 'S BEAUTIFUL . THANK YOU . [ Muffled Screams ] [ Indistinct Police Radio Chatter ] COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO . RISE AND SHINE IN THERE . MOTHER OF GOD . [ Policeman ] DISPATCHER , THIS IS CAR SEVEN-THREE . I GOT A D.P. OUT ON THE LAKEFRONT AT ERIE AND CAPITOL . OVER . [ Chattering ] WE 'RE NOT 100 % CERTAIN , BUT FROM THE DRIVER 'S LICENSE , WE SUSPECT THAT IT 'S LAUREN MACKALVEY . I WANT YOU TO GET ON IT . ALL RIGHT . WE 'LL CHECK THIS OUT . WHY DON 'T WE GO DOWN AND CHECK AROUND ? SOUNDS GOOD . AGENT MULDER ? ALAN CROSS , CLEVELAND P.D. THANKS A LOT FOR COMING OUT SO QUICKLY . THIS IS MY PARTNER , DANA SCULLY . HI . WE FOUND THE PURSE IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THAT CAR OVER THERE . ACCORDING TO THE LICENSE , HER NAME IS , UH , LAUREN MACKALVEY , BUT , UH , WE 'RE NOT SURE YET THAT THIS IS HER BODY . YOU 'RE NOT SURE ? WE COULDN 'T MAKE A POSITIVE I.D. , CONSIDERING . WENDY SPARKS , SHE 'S OUR BUREAU LIAISON . SHE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE , UH , CLOSER TO YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE . ANY INDICATION WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF DEATH ? WE WERE LUCKY TO GET HER INTO THE BAG WITHOUT HER BODY FALLING APART . THIS SUBSTANCE , DID YOU FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE CAR ? IN THE CARPET OR THE UPHOLSTERY ? AS A MATTER OF FACT , NO . SO , IT WAS ONLY ON THE VICTIM 'S BODY . THAT 'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE . WHY ? DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHAT HAPPENED HERE ? NO . NOT YET . WE 'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE FIND ANYTHING ELSE CONCRETE . DETECTIVE ? YEAH , SURE . CALL ME . [ Chattering ] MULDER , WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS ? A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO , A CASE CAME ACROSS MY DESK FROM THE MISSISSIPPI OFFICE . FOUR WOMEN FROM ABERDEEN HAD DISAPPEARED IN LESS THAN A MONTH . DISAPPEARED ? ONLY ONE OF THE VICTIMS WAS FOUND , BUT HER BODY WAS TOO DECOMPOSED TO PERFORM A VIABLE AUTOPSY . MULDER , WHAT WE JUST SAW WAS NOT DECOMPOSITION . I KNOW . I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS IS WHILE YOU 'RE AT THE CORONER 'S . WHAT ABOUT YOU ? WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? I 'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND OUT IF LAUREN MACKALVEY WAS A LONELY HEART . EACH OF THE ABERDEEN VICTIMS HAD ANSWERED PERSONAL ADS IN THE LOCAL PAPERS . IF THIS IS THE SAME KILLER , HE 'S JUST GETTING STARTED . [ Computer Keys Clacking ] [ Chuckles ] [ Knock At Door ] YES . WHAT IS IT ? THE HANDYMAN REPLACED THE LOCKS ON THE STORAGE CLOSETS , AND I WANTED TO BRING BY YOUR NEW KEY . I KNOW WHAT YOU DO , MR. INCANTO . WHAT IS IT YOU THINK THAT I DO ? WITH ALL YOUR TYPING AND THOSE PACKAGES FROM PUBLISHERS IN NEW YORK ? YOU 'RE A NOVELIST , RIGHT ? OR AN EDITOR . YOU SEE , I 'M A WRITER , TOO . WHAT A COINCIDENCE . SHOULDN 'T YOU BE OFF WRITING OR SOMETHING ? I DON 'T MEAN TO IMPOSE OR ANYTHING , BUT WOULD YOU MIND READING SOMETHING OF MINE ? IT WON 'T TAKE MUCH TIME . THEY 'RE POEMS . CERTAINLY . GOOD-BYE . [ Door Lock Clicks ] OH , IT 'S YOU . THAT 'S NOT A PROBLEM , IS IT ? NO . JUST THAT DR. KRAMER DIDN 'T TELL ME THAT YOU WERE OBSERVING THE AUTOPSY . I 'M NOT OBSERVING . I 'M PERFORMING IT MYSELF . YOU 'RE A MEDICAL DOCTOR ? YOU SOUND SURPRISED . I DON 'T KNOW . I , UH , I GUESS MAYBE I AM . - WHY ? - IT 'S NOTHING PERSONAL , AGENT SCULLY . I 'M JUST ... OLD-FASHIONED IN CERTAIN REGARDS . " OLD-FASHIONED " ? THE TRUTH IS , I QUESTION THE WISDOM ... OF ASSIGNING FEMALE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO CERTAIN TYPES OF CASES . LIKE THIS ONE ? WHOEVER KILLED LAUREN MACKALVEY HAS A DEFINITE ATTITUDE TOWARD WOMEN , RIGHT ? SO THIS HAS TO BE AFFECTING YOUR JUDGMENT . I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN , DETECTIVE , BUT IT 'S NOT NECESSARY . ALL I WANT TO DO IS SOLVE THIS CASE , JUST LIKE YOU . LOOK . I 'M NOT BEING SEXIST HERE . I 'M JUST BEING HONEST . WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE THE AUTOPSY REPORT SENT ? YOU CAN FAX IT TO MY OFFICE . THE DATE IS AUGUST 29 . THE TIME IS 4 : 15 P.M. THE SUBJECT 'S NAME IS LAUREN MACKALVEY , CAUCASIAN , FEMALE . APPROXIMATE TIME OF DEATH UNCERTAIN . CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN . [ Woman ] IT JUST DOESN 'T MAKE SENSE . HE SEEMED SO NICE . I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU NEVER MET THE MAN LAUREN WAS WITH LAST NIGHT . I NEVER DID . HE JUST SEEMED NICE ON THE COMPUTER . OH , THEY MET THROUGH AN ON-LINE SERVICE ? IN ONE OF THOSE CHAT ROOMS . YOU KNOW , WHERE PEOPLE GET TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT WHATEVER THEY 'RE INTO . RIGHT . DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT CHAT ROOM LAUREN WAS IN WHEN SHE MET HIM ? " BIG AND BEAUTIFUL . " SHE HAD KIND OF A WEIGHT PROBLEM . BUT " 2SHY " DIDN 'T SEEM TO CARE . IT WASN 'T ABOUT SEX WITH HIM . " 2SHY " ? THAT WAS HIS ON-LINE NAME . LAUREN USED TO ... READ ME HIS LETTERS . THEY WERE AMAZING . HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY . SURE AS HELL FOOLED ME . SHE READ YOU HIS LETTERS . DO YOU THINK THAT SHE KEPT ANY HARD COPIES OF THEM ? ACTUALLY ... I SAVED THEM MYSELF . IF YOU WANT , I COULD GET THEM FOR YOU . YES . CAN I USE YOUR PHONE ? YEAH , IT 'S RIGHT OVER THERE . [ Phone Ringing ] SCULLY . LISTEN , SCULLY . OUR KILLER MAY HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE PERSONAL COLUMNS AND ONTO THE INTERNET . I 'M GOING TO SEND OUT A LOCALIZED ON-LINE WARNING . HOW DO YOU KNOW IT 'S THE SAME GUY ? BECAUSE HE OPENED THE ACCOUNT WITH ONE OF THE ABERDEEN VICTIM 'S CREDIT CARDS . I JUST CALLED THE ON-LINE SERVICE . MULDER , MEET ME IN THE CORONER 'S OFFICE AS SOON AS YOU CAN . - DID YOU FIND ANYTHING ? - THERE 'S NOT GOING TO BE AN AUTOPSY . [ Scully ] IT 'S A METACARPAL FROM LAUREN MACKALVEY 'S HAND . IN LIFE , BONES HAVE THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF FORGED IRON . EVEN IN DEATH , THEY REMAIN STRONG . BUT LOOK AT THIS . WHAT DID THIS TURN OUT TO BE ? IT 'S ORGANIC , MOSTLY HYDROCHLORIC ACID . SIMILAR TO WHAT IS SECRETED BY THE GASTRIC MUCOSA . IT 'S SIMILAR TO STOMACH ACID ? ALMOST IDENTICAL , ONLY TWICE AS ACIDIC . I ALSO FOUND TRACE AMOUNTS OF PEPSIN , WHICH IS A DIGESTIVE ENZYME . SO , YOU 'RE SAYING THAT THIS DID THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN SUCH ACCELERATED AUTOLYSIS . OKAY , WHAT 'S IN HERE , SCULLY , THEORETICALLY ... SHOULD CONTAIN THE SAME CELLULAR COMPONENTS AS HER VARIOUS TISSUES , RIGHT ? SKIN , MUSCLE , BLOOD . IN SOME BROKEN-DOWN FORM , YES . IN THE RESULTS OF YOUR CHEMICAL ANALYSIS , DID YOU FIND ANYTHING MISSING ? MISSING ? YEAH . I DON 'T THINK SO . ALL OF THE BODY TISSUES WERE ACCOUNTED FOR . EXCEPT THERE WERE EXTREMELY LOW , ALMOST TRACE AMOUNTS OF ADIPOSE . FATTY TISSUE . THAT COULD EXPLAIN THE WEIGHT DISCREPANCY . - WHAT WEIGHT DISCREPANCY ? - WELL , THE M.E. RECORDED LAUREN 'S WEIGHT AT 122 , BUT HER DRIVER 'S LICENSE HAD HER AT 165 . WELL , SHE PROBABLY LOST WEIGHT SINCE THE LICENSE WAS ISSUED . ACTUALLY , LAUREN 'S ROOMMATE SAID SHE WAS QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT MEETING THIS GUY , BECAUSE SHE 'D PUT ON SOME WEIGHT RECENTLY . [ Scoffs ] WHAT POSSIBLE MOTIVATION COULD THE KILLER HAVE FOR REMOVING HIS VICTIM 'S FATTY TISSUE ? I MEAN , WHO DO YOU THINK WE 'RE DEALING WITH HERE ? I DON 'T KNOW . GOD , I LOOK AWFUL . PLEASE TELL ME IT 'S THE MIRROR . ELLEN , THIS WASN 'T SOME PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT . IT WAS AN ON-LINE WARNING BY THE F.B.I. AIMED SPECIFICALLY AT WOMEN IN CLEVELAND . GIVE ME SOME CREDIT , WILL YOU , JO ? I HAPPEN TO BE A PRETTY GOOD JUDGE OF CHARACTER . LOOK . I 'M NOT TRYING TO FREAK YOU OUT OR ANYTHING . NO ? WELL , YOU 'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT . I JUST THINK YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL , THAT 'S ALL . DO YOU THINK THIS IS EASY FOR ME ? I FINALLY CONNECT WITH SOMEONE I LIKE WHO SEEMS TO LIKE ME . I 'M SCARED ENOUGH TO MEET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME ... WITHOUT YOU TELLING ME HE 'S CHARLES MANSON . I DIDN 'T SAY THAT . BESIDES , IT 'S NOT LIKE HE 'S SOME STRANGER . I 'VE BEEN CHATTING WITH HIM EVERY DAY FOR OVER A MONTH . I KNOW . AND HE 'S PROBABLY AS GREAT AS HE SOUNDS . BUT WHAT IF HE ISN 'T ? [ Sighs ] CHECK IT OUT . WANT A LITTLE CHOCOLATE TONIGHT ? [ Chattering Continues ] HEY , BABY . RIGHT HERE . [ Horn Honks ] [ Chattering Continues ] [ Woman ] RIGHT OVER HERE , BABY . I 'M HERE . GOT WHAT YOU NEED OVER HERE , IF YOU 'D LIKE SOME OF THIS . OOH , YEAH . SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE ? YOU WANT SOME ? I THINK HE HAVE THE HOTS FOR YOU , BABY . I THINK SO . [ Laughs ] HEY , HEY ! WHAT DO YOU LIKE , BABY ? UH-UH . NO KISSING . ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT IS FINE , BUT NO KISSING . [ Belt Clinking ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? [ Screams ] AAH ! OH ! - [ Grunts ] - [ Screams ] THERE 'S A PLACE WE CAN GO NEAR HERE . NICE AND COZY . OKAY . [ Woman Laughing ] [ Gasping ] UH-UH . FORGET THIS . OH , MY GOD . [ Man ] MAKE SURE YOU GET STATEMENTS FROM ALL OF THEM . HER NAME WAS HOLLY McCLAINE . SHE 'S WORKED THIS AREA FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW , BUT SHE WASN 'T MOST JOHNS ' FIRST PICK , IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN . WHAT HAPPENED ? LOOKS LIKE OUR GUY AGAIN . ONE OF THE OTHER GIRLS FOUND HER . ALL OF THE AIR PASSAGES ARE BLOCKED WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE ... THE SAME VISCOUS HYDROCHLORIC ACID WE FOUND ON LAUREN MACKALVEY . YOU KNOW WHAT THIS STUFF IS ? HEY , THIS IS STILL MY CASE . WE 'RE DEALING WITH A SERIAL MURDERER ... WHO 'S USING AN ON-LINE SERVICE TO ATTRACT HIS VICTIMS . ALL SINGLE WOMEN LOOKING FOR MR. RIGHT . THAT DOESN 'T JIBE WITH A $ 20 HOOKER . NO , IT DOESN 'T . SOMETHING MUST HAVE GONE WRONG LAST NIGHT . HE WAS FORCED TO IMPROVISE . WE 'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT A GUY WITHOUT A CONSISTENT M.O. NOT NECESSARILY . THESE ARE LETTERS HE E-MAILED TO LAUREN MACKALVEY . THEY CONTAIN LINES FROM A HANDFUL OF 16th-CENTURY ITALIAN POEMS . SO HE HAS A COPY OFBARTLETT 'S QUOTATIONS . SO WHAT ? YOU WON 'T FIND ANY OF THESE INBARTLETT 'S . I 'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW YOU . LOOK AT THIS . GINASELLI 'SLA VITA NUOVA , CASTIONNI 'SIL CORTIGIANO , AND A FEW OTHERS I WON 'T EVEN TRY TO PRONOUNCE . THESE ARE FROM OBSCURE TEXT FROM PRIVATELY-OWNED LIBRARIES THAT LEND TO ACADEMIC AFFILIATES . YOU 'RE SAYING OUR- - OUR SUSPECT 'S A COLLEGE PROFESSOR ? OR A GRADUATE STUDENT , A VISITING FELLOW , MAYBE A TRANSLATOR . WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS COMPILE A LIST OF EVERYBODY IN THE CLEVELAND AREA ... WHO HAS THESE KIND OF CREDENTIALS . CAN YOU DO THAT ? YEAH . I 'LL GET RIGHT ON IT . HERE 'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT HELP . THE KILLER SHOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFIABLE WOUND PATTERN FROM THIS . LOOKS LIKE SHE TOOK HER POUND OF FLESH , HUH ? [ Doorbell Buzzes ] YES ? [ Man ] I GOT A PACKAGE FOR INCANTO FROM STRATCHER PUBLISHING . LEAVE IT . SORRY . I GOTTA GET A SIGNATURE . [ Sighs ] HELLO , MR. INCANTO . GOOD AFTERNOON , JESSE . [ Woman ] JESSE , DID YOU FIND THOSE DROP CLOTHS YET ? OH , MR. INCANTO . I DIDN 'T KNOW YOU WERE OUT HERE . I 'M JUST PICKING UP A PACKAGE . JESSE , DID YOU KNOW THAT MR. INCANTO 'S A WRITER ? I KNOW , MOM . YOU TOLD ME A THOUSAND TIMES . [ Embarrassed Chuckle ] I 'M PUTTING THOSE POEMS TOGETHER . IF YOU DON 'T MIND , I 'D LIKE TO DROP THEM BY SOMETIME . JUST SLIP IT UNDER MY DOOR . AFTER YOU 'VE READ THEM , CAN I TAKE YOU TO DINNER SOMEWHERE ? - [ Jesse ] GIVE ME A BREAK . - ACTUALLY , I 'M BUSY . I HAVE A DEADLINE . I DON 'T BELIEVE THIS . [ Knocking At Door ] [ Man ] EXCUSE ME . I WISH YOU WEREN 'T ALWAYS SO RUDE TO HIM . I DON 'T CARE . HE CREEPS ME OUT . PLUS HE SMELLS GROSS , LIKE HE USES DISH SOAP FOR AFTER SHAVE . [ Scoffs ] [ Computer Keys Clacking ] [ Cross ] OKAY . BLAINE JUST GAVE ME THE LIST FROM THE UNIVERSITY . HOW 'S IT GOING OVER HERE ? [ Scully ] GOOD . WE 'RE JUST EXPANDING THE SEARCH ... TO INCLUDE THE FACULTY ROSTERS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES . WE- - OH , EXCUSE ME . SURE . I 'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT WE TURN UP . [ Mulder ] DID YOU FIND ANYTHING ? WE 'RE ALMOST DONE WITH THE LIST . THAT SKIN YOU FOUND UNDER THE PROSTITUTE 'S FINGERNAILS ? I HAD THE CRIME LAB CHECK THE DNA RESULTS AGAINST THE KNOWN OFFENDERS DATABASE . AND ? WELL , IT SAYS HERE THEY DIDN 'T FIND A MATCH . NO , BUT THEY DID FIND SOMETHING ELSE . CHECK THE NEXT PAGE WHERE IT 'S CIRCLED . " THE SKIN SAMPLE CONTAINS NO OILS OR ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID . " THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT RESULT . WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS ? OKAY , IT 'S NOT YET THE FINELY-DETAILED INSANITY YOU 'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM ME . IT 'S JUST A THEORY , BUT WHAT IF HE 'S NOT DOING THIS ... OUT OF A PSYCHOTIC IMPULSE BUT RATHER OUT OF SOME PHYSICAL HUNGER ? MAYBE HE NEEDS TO REPLENISH THIS CHEMICAL DEFICIENCY IN ORDER TO SURVIVE . FROM A DRY-SKIN SAMPLE , YOU 'RE CONCLUDING WHAT ? THAT HE 'S SOME KIND OF A FAT-SUCKING VAMPIRE ? I DON 'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN LAUREN MACKALVEY 'S MISSING ADIPOSE . I BET IF YOU CHECK THE ABERDEEN VICTIMS , YOU 'D FIND EXACTLY THE SAME THING . THIS KILLER SECRETES A DIGESTIVE SUBSTANCE WHICH RENDERS THE VICTIM 'S FAT- - WHICH HE INGESTS BEFORE THE REST OF THE BODY DISSOLVES ENTIRELY . THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS IN NATURE , AREN 'T THERE ? YEAH , SCORPIONS PREDIGEST THEIR FOOD OUTSIDE OF THEIR BODY ... BY REGURGITATING ONTO THEIR PREY . BUT I DON 'T KNOW TOO MANY SCORPIONS WHO SURF THE INTERNET . OKAY , BUT IF I 'M RIGHT , THEN WE 'RE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR A SERIAL MURDERER . WE 'RE LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF GENETICALLY-DIFFERENT HUMAN BEING , A CREATURE WHO MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MISSING PERSONS ... THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES . WE 'VE COMBED EVERY FACULTY LIST AND ACADEMIC JOURNAL IN CLEVELAND . CAME UP WITH 38 NAMES . I FIGURED WE 'D DIVVY UP THE LIST , AND I 'D GET THE CAPTAIN TO PUT MORE PEOPLE ON IT . I 'D LIKE TO BRIEF THEM , IF THAT 'S OKAY WITH YOU . SURE . [ Beeps ] [ Computer Voice ] YOU HAVE MAIL . [ Knock At Door ] MR. BRENMAN ? I 'M SPECIAL AGENT SCULLY FROM THE F.B.I. WOULD YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS ? THANKS . I 'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU . I 'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS . SURE . [ Scully ] THESE ARE ALL UNIVERSITY ADDRESSES . CHANCES ARE HE SPENT MOST OF THE MORNING ON CAMPUS . SCULLY . I WOULDN 'T HAVE MADE A GOOD AMWAY SALESMAN . I KNOCKED ON MORE DOORS THAN- - CROSS HASN 'T CHECKED IN YET . WE 'VE BEEN TRYING HIS CELL PHONE , BUT THERE 'S NO ANSWER . - I 'M TREATING YOU . - NO , I INSIST . AFTER THE WAY I STOOD YOU UP , I 'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD INSIST . PLEASE ? I 'M SORRY . I SHOULDN 'T HAVE- - IT 'S A KIND OF ECZEMA . I 'VE HAD IT SINCE I WAS A KID . OH . YOU KNOW , I STILL FEEL SO STUPID ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT . ELLEN , YOU DON 'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES . WHATEVER REASONS YOU HAD , I 'M SURE THEY WERE GOOD ONES . YOU WERE RIGHT , THOUGH , ABOUT ME BEING AFRAID . IT 'S A PRETTY HARD HABIT TO BREAK . YOU 'RE NOT STILL AFRAID , ARE YOU ? - NO , I 'M NOT . - GOOD . UNFORTUNATELY , I HAVE TO GET GOING . THE LAST CROSSTOWN BUS LEAVES IN 15 MINUTES . - YOU 'RE TAKING THE BUS HOME ? - MY CAR 'S IN THE SHOP , BUT I 'LL CALL YOU . - DON 'T BE SILLY . I 'LL DRIVE YOU . - ELLEN , YOU DON 'T HAVE TO . I 'M DRIVING YOU HOME . MR. INCANTO ? SO , HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE ? NOT VERY LONG . YOU KNOW , I ONLY LIVE A FEW BLOCKS AWAY , NEAR ST . MARK 'S , UNTIL SOME DEVELOPER DECIDED TO TURN IT INTO CONDOS . YOU CAN STILL SEE THE STEEPLE . ELLEN , YOU DON 'T HAVE TO BE NERVOUS . I 'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS . IT 'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I 'VE BEEN IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION . IT 'S OKAY . [ Fly Buzzes ] - [ Flies Buzzing ] - [ Sniffing ] WHY DON 'T YOU COME UP WITH ME ? I 'LL READ YOU THAT POEM I TOLD YOU ABOUT- - IL CASSONE . I DON 'T KNOW . IT 'S KIND OF LATE . WELL , I DON 'T WANT TO SAY GOOD NIGHT JUST YET , DO YOU ? YOU KNOW WHAT ? YOU 'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT . IT 'S LATE . I HAVE A LOT OF WORK I HAVE TO DO . EXCUSE ME . [ Flies Buzzing ] [ Sniffing ] [ Door Creaks ] [ Door Creaks ] MR. INCANTO ? MR. INCANTO ? WHAT IS IT , JESSE ? UH , DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY MOM IS ? YOUR MOTHER ? NO . SHE TAKES A CLASS DOWN AT ST . FRANK 'S TONIGHT , A POETRY CLASS , AND SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HOME OVER AN HOUR AGO . I 'M SURE SHE 'LL BE HOME SOON . SHE DIDN 'T STOP BY TO SAY HI OR ANYTHING ? NO . NOT TONIGHT . OKAY . THANKS . SHE 'LL PROBABLY BE HOME SOON . I 'M GOING TO NEW YORK FOR A FEW DAYS ON BUSINESS . DON 'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER . I 'M SURE SHE 'LL BE FINE . [ Chattering , Phones Ringing ] [ Man ] CLEVELAND P.D. [ Mulder ] HIS NAME 'S CROSS . THAT 'S RIGHT . HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BY SOMETIME THIS AFTERNOON . [ Scully ] MAYBE SOMETIME THIS MORNING . DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT TIME SPECIFICALLY ? COULD YOU DESCRIBE HIM TO ME FOR VERIFICATION ? EXCUSE ME A MINUTE . DID YOU FIND HIM ? WE JUST GOT A 911 REPORTING A POSSIBLE HOMICIDE ... FROM A YOUNG GIRL AT ONE OF THE ADDRESSES ON CROSS 'S LIST . POLICE ! [ Chattering ] [ Woman ] CLEAR BACK HERE . [ Man ] WE GOT TWO IN HERE . MULDER . THE LANDLADY 'S BODY . WE FOUND HER IN THE BATHROOM . WHAT ABOUT CROSS ? [ Scully ] I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW , BUT I NEED YOU TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED . I SMELLED HER PERFUME . YOUR MOTHER 'S PERFUME ? THAT 'S WHEN I KNEW HE WAS LYING . SHE WAS WEARING HER PERFUME WHEN SHE LEFT FOR CLASS . AND YOU SMELLED IT IN HIS APARTMENT ? I WAS- - I WAS SCARED THAT HE 'D HURT ME . I COULD TELL HE WANTED TO . AND THEN HE GRABBED ME . HE GRABBED YOU ? AFTER I BUMPED INTO THE SUITCASE , HE GRABBED ME PRETTY HARD . WHAT SUITCASE ? IT WAS NEXT TO THE DOOR . HE SAID HE WAS GOING AWAY ON BUSINESS OR SOMETHING . DID HE SAY WHERE ? UM , NEW YORK . OKAY , JESSE , THAT HELPS US . I 'M GONNA TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES AND GO TALK TO AGENT MULDER . MRS. SHEPHERD IS RIGHT HERE . I 'LL BE RIGHT BACK . AGENT SCULLY ? YEAH . WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THIS ? I DON 'T KNOW , JESSE . THE COMPOSITE ARTIST CAME UP WITH THIS SKETCH FROM A NEIGHBOR 'S DESCRIPTION . HIS NAME IS VIRGIL INCANTO . AT LEAST THAT 'S WHAT IT SAYS ON HIS RENTAL AGREEMENT . BUT OTHER THAN THAT , THERE 'S NO RECORD THE GUY EVEN EXISTS . THERE 'S NO D.M.V. , NO BIRTH CERTIFICATE , NO SOCIAL SECURITY , NOT EVEN A BANK ACCOUNT . WHAT ABOUT EMPLOYMENT RECORDS ? HE 'S A TRANSLATOR OF ITALIAN LITERATURE . FREELANCE . HIS PUBLISHER PAYS HIM IN CASHIER 'S CHECKS . HE TOLD THE GIRL HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO NEW YORK . I 'LL CHECK FLIGHT SCHEDULES AND HAVE THE AIRPORT ISSUE AN A.P.B. WHAT IS IT ? HE 'S NOT GOING TO NEW YORK , SCULLY . NOT NOW . HE 'S SMARTER THAN THAT . HE KNOWS HOW TO SURVIVE , YOU KNOW ? WELL , HOW ARE WE GOING TO TRACK HIM ? WELL , HE MADE CONTACT WITH EACH ONE OF HIS VICTIMS , RIGHT ? YEAH . THAT MEANS THEY 'RE ALL IN HERE SOMEWHERE . EACH ONE OF THEM- - PAST , PRESENT AND FUTURE . ALL THE FILES HAVE BEEN DELETED . ANY CHANCE OF RESURRECTING THEM ? IT 'S HARD TO SAY . HE DELIBERATELY REFORMATTED HIS HARD DRIVE . THIS GUY DIDN 'T WANT ANYONE LOOKING AT HIS STUFF . [ Computer Beeps ] HMM . THE GOOD NEWS IS ... I CAN RESTORE THE ERASED FILES . AND THE BAD NEWS ? THESE FILES ARE ALL PASSWORD-PROTECTED AND ENCRYPTED . IT COULD TAKE SOME TIME . WELL , WE DON 'T HAVE MUCH TIME .

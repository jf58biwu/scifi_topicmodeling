 Man , I cannot tell you what a joy it is to slide into a world where we can take in a movie . Sorry , guys . Time is something we are out of . All right , this Gable guy I can sort of understand , but what kind of world would make Bogart a star ? He 's short , he lisps ... Girl , if you don 't get it , I can 't explain it to you . Counting down . Six , five ... Come on . Well , it 's still San Francisco . 400-mile radius and we don 't go four feet . Welcome to the same old same old . Not exactly . I guess the convention 's not in town . Bet it won 't be hard getting a room . No bodies . Looks like everyone just took a powder . Well , whatever the story is , we 're here for a week . Okay . Hey ! Hello ! Anybody ! Looks like we missed it by a couple of years . You think maybe Kromaggs ? No blast marks , no rubble . They 're generally a lot showier . Hey ! I 've heard of bio-warfare experiments . So what 're you saying ? That everything is dead ? Not everything . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Get out of here ! Move ! It 's a good thing the keys were in the door . You 'd be Puppy Chow . Family home 's still here . It looks a little worse for wear . Oh , please . Hello ? Hello ? Any Mallorys on the premises ? Nada . Hey , get a load of this . " To Quinn Mallory . " That 's the McKay Prize for Scholarship , that 's the Pedderson Award . I tried for these , but never won . Looks like the Quinn on this world is more of an egghead than you are . If that 's possible . Quinn . On this world , my mom died when I was a little kid , and I was raised by my dad . The other me turned out to be somebody . You know , you 're no slouch . Yeah . Except every time I try to retool this to accept my brother 's coordinates ... Each world , I keep hoping for a physicist to help me , but with every slide , we just get farther and farther away . Quinn ! Come on , let 's check out the basement . Whoa ! Well , it looks like they had one hell of a party . More like one hell of a tantrum . When did this happen , and why ? So what 's to do ? We find food we can eat , keep clear of anything that can eat us , and make it through the week . You guys head on up . I 'm gonna have another look around . Don 't take too long . He 's hurting , Rembrandt . Lost . I know that feeling . Well , Quinn finds out he 's from another world , your home is blown up , and mine is taken over by Kromaggots . I guess we 're all shipwrecked in one way or another . But at least we 're all floating on the same piece of driftwood . What 's taking him so long ? Yeah . Hey , Q-Ball ! Shake a leg , man ! We got places to go ! People to see . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , who are you ? Where have you been ? How did you survive ? It 's Quinn . We just got here . You stay back . I 'm alone . I 'm alone , I 'm alone . We 're as real as you are . We 're just not from here . I don 't understand . Look , friend , we 'll tell you the whole nine yards . But , first , where in the devil is everybody ? I built a machine in my basement . An antigravitational device , or that 's what I thought it was . But when I ... When I threw the switch , it wiped every human being off the face of the Earth . Funny thing , I 've traveled all over , and somehow I always end up back here . It 's a good thing I did . So for three years , you thought you were the last man on Earth ? I was the last man . It took a while to dawn on me , but , you know , at first I thought it was just local , and then ... Then I realized it was everywhere . We all tell ourselves , " I feel so alone , " but you have no idea . I 'd ... I 'd listen to old records , watch old movies , just to hear a voice that wasn 't my own . The device you built must 've been a lot more powerful than mine . This wave of light surged out and covered everything , and when it cleared , they were gone . A slide wave . And being in the eye of the storm , it didn 't take you . It shouldn 't have happened . I did everything right . Except test it . That was the test ! Look , I 'm sorry . I know how you must feel about me , but ... Look around ! I 've paid the price ! You have ? What about everyone else ? Didn 't you ever think that they might not be dead ? I realized they might 've been sent to another time or another dimension . But what difference did it make ? The difference between them being dead and alive ! I mean , what difference did it make , in the sense that I couldn 't get them back ? So you tried to replicate the experiment ? Yeah , yeah , but I ... I couldn 't get the exact parameters . So , in the end , I just got so crazy-mad I just smashed it all to pieces . Yeah , we saw that . You got any notes or diagrams ? Why ? We might be able to rebuild your equipment , get a line on where you sent everyone . I told you , that 's impossible . Well , every now and then , we 've managed to do the impossible . We 've been sliding for a while now . We might know a trick or two that you don 't . There might be some notes in the storeroom . That is one cold-hearted " hombre . " It 's like nothing else matters but him . Destroying your world is a hard thing to face . He 's been through a lot . And hope is a dangerous thing . Yeah , maybe this kid is cut from a different cloth , Q-Ball . What 're you saying ? I 'm saying that what keeps you up at night , maybe he sleeps through it . Notes should be in here somewhere , if the rats and spiders haven 't gotten to them first . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Careful with that . It 's the Nobel Prize . My dad won it . Not that he cared much . Till the day he died , all he ever valued was pure science . Quite a collection between the two of you . Oh , mine ? Kid stuff . Meant nothing . He was a tough act to follow . You have no idea . Maybe I do . Distinguished Flying Cross , Silver Palm with cluster , Congressional Medal of Honor ... At home , we called him " the General . " Lots of us have ghosts . Oh ! Ah ! You don 't think small , do you ? Remember , skip anything with water damage or corrosion . Did you get those lithium batteries ? Yeah , I got 10 of them . Get 12 . This world gives self-service a whole new meaning . A little rusty , but they 'll do . Not that any of this is gonna work , though , you know . I tried . You don 't like someone doing something you can 't . I don 't like the idea of wasted time . It can 't be done . You 're afraid . What of ? Nothing . Let 's just get this over with . Oh , yes ! Hey , what 's the deal ? That 's not on the list . It 's a bio-med scanner . If the world he slid everyone to already had people on it , we 'll need some way to differentiate the ones from here so we can slide them back . I might be able to adapt this to detect a trace sliding signature in their cells . You know , I was just gonna suggest that very same thing . Come on , guys , we have to move on . We have everything we need ? Yeah . Yeah , now all we got to do is put it together . That is powerful enough to slide the whole planet ? The original was a lot smaller , but I had to make do . What 's the matter , Quinn ? Got device envy ? So , when we jump to the other world , this will send out a slide wave ? No , we reset it for a narrower field . Besides , it 'd take a lot more juice than this battery could crank out . The first time , I crashed the entire West Coast power grid . For a test ? Hey , gizmo looks pretty good . Hey , Rembrandt , where have you been ? Well , you never can tell what kind of world you might be sliding into . While you two eggheads were jerry-rigging this baby , I figured I 'd get us some coin of the realm . Ho , ho ! Not to mention a mint copy of " Superman " Number 1 . This world might be dead , but it still has its advantages . So , the big moment . You want the honors ? I 'll take point . Never argue with a lady who 's got a gun . The world you made . Not up to it ? Is it always that rough ? You mean like being dragged behind a truck in a canvas sack ? The slide wave must have damaged the dimensional pathway . What 'll that do ? I don 't know yet . So , how 's the machine ? Cooling down . But I want to run a diagnostic . But I 'll say this for it . It landed us just where we set it to go . Pretty wild , huh ? You travel to different dimensions , only to wind up in the same room . Yeah . But this ain 't my room . Hey ! How you doing , there , little fellow ? Hey , kid ! Maggie , no ! Sister ! Sister ! Hey ! Hey , where 've they been ? Hey ! What are you doing ? Get that weapon away from me . Back off ! Now ! And as for you , put up your weapon , or you are going to be one less soul on this blighted Earth . You better do what she says . She 's not one to bluff . Quiet ! Quiet ! I can 't hear myself think ! Well , you got rivets , I 'll give you that . And how you got past the tripwire , the razor blades , and not to mention the dogs ... I 'm telling you we didn 't break in , we ... Materialized , right . You 're three years too late . The little kid saw us . Last week he saw the Easter Bunny . Look , we got no drugs , no fuel , and this shelter can 't half-feed the mouths it 's already got . So you 've had some hard times . What gave you your first clue ? And if this box is some scam that you 're running ... Don 't touch that ! Believe me , you won 't like it . All right , so what do we do now ? Play board games ? Get rid of them . Throw them out . Come on , let 's go . Come on ! Wait a minute ! Hey ! I know you don 't buy what we 're saying , so why don 't you tell us what happened three years ago ? And why don 't you drop the act ? It 's not going to get you anything . It started a long time ago . God saw what became of the world , and he made a terrible rain . And he told Noah , " Bring the animals two by two . " And he spared them . But in time , the world became as it had been : Unholy , corrupt . And so God brought his terrible judgment . He made two by two , only this time it was with people . What had been one became two . Five billion became ten . And so hell was made manifest . So we could see what we had done to his beautiful creation . This is our penance and our shame . Well , that 's just one theory . There are plenty to go around . Oh , my Lord . I did it . What ? What did he say ? What ? It wasn 't God . I did it . You did ? Clear away . Clear away . No , no , no , no , no . It needs to be checked out . Oh . Okay . Don 't ! I 'll show you ! Shut it down ! Now ! Shut it down ! Great ! This is just great ! Well ? I 've seen magicians pull stunts like that . Are you on crack , Sister ? Then maybe we should do something that they can 't . Look at that ! With all of this , why would we need to rob you ? But I guess you could rob us . You got to have some trust . Perkins ! Where 's Perkins ? Perkins ? Here he is ! Now , what you saw in the basement , are you sure about that ? Yeah ! They came out of nothing ! They weren 't there , and then they were ! So just what do you want ? The wrath of the great unwashed . And you wonder why I feel superior ? You set something on fire . They put it out . Yes , I wonder how that makes you superior . Whatever you say , pal . We 're not like them . I 'll give you this . You may have a losing personality , but it really is an amazing design . This is just for starters . I 've got lots ... Hey , Q-Ball , I 'm scanning these folk , but I can 't make heads or tails of these numbers . Just jot them down . Unless we can zero in on their trace signature , we won 't be able to ship these people back . Of course , that 's assuming we ever get this running . We needed a visual aid . I turned it on . We had to show them something . Yes . But not that . Do you have to stand so close , Sister Rambo ? Word 's gotten out about you . They all know you did this to them . So maybe you better be grateful for a bodyguard . You hate me , too ? How 's it looking ? Not good . We need replacement parts , and we can 't exactly go back to where we came from . So we go around the corner to the radio shed . Let me clue you in . This ain 't no Mayberry . When the federal government collapsed , all these warlords sprung up . The one we got here 's just called " the Boss . " His cops run the streets , and you don 't want to mess with them . So what are you saying ? Do what you have to , but do it fast . Boy , their curfew must be strict . The streets aren 't too crowded . Hold on . I 'll take that . I don 't think so . Give him the gun , Maggie . No way . We need those parts , Maggie . Do I get a claim check ? This ain 't no coat check , sweetheart . We keep it . Why do I get the feeling that the customer is always wrong ? Okay , how much for all this stuff ? What do you got ? I bet we got just enough . Well , well ! Made out like bandits , didn 't you ? Come on . Come on . You know , I 've been thinking . You and I make a good team . This doesn 't have to be the end of things . It could be the start . What are you saying ? We get back , maybe you miss the slide window , we build another one of these , a better one . My father was right . I get impatient , make mistakes . But you , you 're slow , you 're steady . For you , the equations ... Wait a minute . You 're talking about a mathematical mistake . What else ? I was trying to cut across the continuum without ... Doesn 't matter . Most of the world 's greatest discoveries were an accident . Together , we could do something with this , show them it was worth the cost ! That 's still what this is about for you ! Proving your genius . Haven 't you seen ? Heard ? Haven 't you looked around ? Hasn 't any of this affected you at all ? Of course . But what happened happened . Hey , in science , you can 't control every ... Science didn 't throw that switch , you did ! Hey , Quinn ! When I first tested it , it was small , and on myself . Not on the whole damn world . You didn 't have to use that much power . Hey . You just didn 't give a damn ! The universe has risks . The universe has no conscience . So we have to . Let it in . You blew it . Quinn . The answer 's no ! Hey , Maggie , Maggie , let them hatch it out for themselves . Hey , watch out ! Watch out . Hey , whoa , come on ! Hey , what did we do , Jaywalk ? These aren 't like the cops back home ! Yeah , speak for yourself ! Come on ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Through there ! Let 's go ! You came back for me . Not for you . For who I 'd be if I didn 't . All right , come on . Brought you some stew . Leave it on the step . What do you see up there ? What do you want me to see ? My dark soul ? Look , we 're tired . Why don 't you give us both a break ? I was just remembering . Right after my mom died , my dad took me up to the roof and showed me the stars . He said we 're all made of star stuff , and it 's up to us to blaze across the sky and burn ourselves into the world , so we 'd never be forgotten . There are other ways to matter . I 'll buy a dog . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I 've got a headache and I 'm just not in the mood for sympathy . In some ways you 're so different , and in some ways you 're exactly the same . Than Saint Quinn ? He 's not ... He 's no saint . But he does care about people . Sometimes too much . And not about being some name in a history book . I 'll let you in on something . Daddy 's gone . And unless you start caring about someone , even if you 're not the last man on Earth , you 're gonna be alone . I was right about the sliding signature . We can realign the slide wave to return the population of your world anytime we 'd like . But there is a catch . The next slide wave will collapse the path between the two worlds . It should get everyone there safely ... But it 's just a one-way ticket . Hold on a minute , Q-Ball . I mean , the world 's moved on since three years past . Now , a woman I spoke to here married someone who " appeared , " and they had a kid . Now , the slide takes everyone with a signature , right ? We 're gonna smash a lot of stuff up here . Before the change , I was half a person . I 'd do good works , touch the lives of others . But somehow , no one ever touched me . Then I met my other self . It was like I 'd found home . I got to watch myself outside myself . A mirror on all my flaws and my strengths . Beyond all else , I prize her , being with her . I 'd give my life for that . But you 've got to send us back . Two worlds with abundance . Not one that 's dying . All right . All I got to do is throw the switch . But we need power . Stifle ! I have a dream . A bathtub full of soap bubbles . Soft music playing . And nothing else . Maybe we all have a shot at that . But we have to make it happen . Electricity ! The Boss doesn 't care if the little people starve in the streets , freeze in the cold , huddle in the dark . " Power to the people " means just his people . The power station is part of his palace , fortress , whatever . It 's next to his throne room . So just how do we get there ? Roberto ! This is my good right hand . He can get anything , fix anything , knows a lot about a little and a little about a lot . You forgot to kiss my ring . And before he got the boot , was honcho at the power station . Whatever you 're thinking ... We just got to borrow some juice . Uh-uh ! No way . If we pull this off , everyone will have a second chance . You 'll all have hope again ! And 250 in silver . Just where were you hiding that ? Feeder cable shaft will get us there . But in and out , no photo ops . So , where do we find this place ? This way . Look . You can 't miss it . I would definitely call that a fortress . The static from the feeder lines made the security cams all hinky . After a while , they just stopped bothering . Man , this was one cherry job . Lived like Elvis if you toed the line , women , cars and a health plan . So what got you canned ? They wanted me to fry this guy , you know , wire up this urinal so that when he took a whiz , zap ? But I couldn 't . I mean , him and me had been in Boy Scouts . Let 's just pretend I fired off a volley to get your attention . Now , I don 't want to do that , 'cause it 's a mess patching equipment , prying out slugs . So drop your weapons , okay ? I didn 't think I 'd be seeing you again , Roberto . Hey , Eldon . We always treated each other square . How about you let us go ? If it was just me , maybe . But these guys got big mouths . They just can 't be trusted . Let 's go . Cubans . Hard to come by nowadays . $ 2,500 apiece . But oh , so pleasurable . These were a gift , brought to me by a petitioner . So . What have you brought me ? Spiritual comfort ? The optimism of youth ? Roberto . See , they don 't know me , but you do . Last time , you had a spare . No such luxury this time . Is there something you want to tell me , Roberto ? Well , at least it isn 't another cell . Wonder what Roberto is telling him . He 's singing our praises , no doubt . Listen , I got a plan . We lay it all out for the Boss in exchange for our services . Services ? Like what ? Designing armor , weapons , that kind of stuff . In exchange for giving us what we need . Like our lives ? And research facilities . So maybe this guy gets to be boss of sliding ? Not if we play our cards right . You want to work for this sociopath and give him more power ? I owe you an apology . The sister was right . A mirror of our strengths and flaws . When I first saw all those trophies and awards , there was a moment I envied you . We both act like it 's about what we do , not what we are . Being smarter than anyone . Remmy , what 's important ? Maggie ? I 'm sorry if I haven 't gotten through to you . But if you say a word , I 'll still break your neck . Ooh ! Your presence is requested . You know , I love this job . You ask for things , and you get them ! Come . Roberto and I have been having the most stimulating chat . A little hard to believe . I mean , it 's quite a fish story , that you , uh ... You caused all this ? But if it 's true , I owe you quite a debt of thanks . See , my life before that wasn 't meeting my expectations . What 'd you do ? Walk behind parades with a shovel ? Ha ! Sorry . Close ! I wrote greeting cards . Listen , let 's just plug it in , flip the switch . World will be a much better place . World looks pretty good from where I 'm sitting . Give it a rest . The man 's heart is made of solid meat . Ooh ! Not bad , though . I may use that . Eldon ? Read it its rights . Eldon , wait ! What ? You think you get a vote here ? You don 't get a vote . Eldon , the way I see it , there are two kinds of cops . The cowboy jerks and the regular guys who want to make things better , who don 't always do what they 're told . Eldon . Now , this can take this world back to the way it was , or at least closer . You blow it to pieces , and it 'll stay hell here forever . Now , look , I 'd really like to help you . But I 'm no hero . Eldon , wait ! Your moving speech has changed my mind . Read him his rights first . No ! Quinn ! Hey , man , she 's got a gun ! You okay ? You 're still on our time ! Come on ! I owe you , man . Go ! Move it ! Come on , man ! Get going ! Got the door ! Damn . You see what happens when you people get through to me ? Talk me through it . Now . Grab that cable , hook the bare wire into your terminals . Don 't touch it until I turn it off . Keep pressure on it . The power ! Can 't we kill the power ? Not from this side ! You 're a real beauty queen , you are . A real champion ! I want that door open now ! Get back . Clear ! Go ! Let 's go ! Move it ! Move it ! Move ! Move ! Check upstairs ! Go ! Shoot ! Shoot ! Shoot to kill ! Fire ! Fire ! I 'm out ! If you got something to do , I 'd do it now ! Hit it ! Remmy ! Initiating sequence ! Yeah ! Now , that 's a ride worth the ticket ! Take it easy , fellows . Put the guns on safety . You 're home . Hey , Boss . Because I care to send the very best . Here . You 'll be okay . Speak for yourself ! I 'm not used to getting shot . I guess it woke me up , though . Hey , you got everybody back . But to what ? We 'll be getting you blankets and food shortly . What ? Well , that 's just one thing ... So , I 'm taking the Mother Teresa route . Might be a bad fit , but what the hell . Almost time . With the circuitry I 've integrated from your specs , we should be able to slide to the coordinates of my brother 's world . If it doesn 't burn out first . Adopted , a brother , different worlds , different lives . Infinite possibilities . For them ? They 've got room to breathe now , thanks to you , buddy . Yeah , but all they 'll remember is that I sent them there in the first place . You could come with us . Fresh start . No . Thanks . I 've got some work to do . Okay , then . You could stay here , you know . I got a room you can rent , or we could share one . Thanks , but ... " No . " He 's a good guy . Yeah . All right . Next stop , family reunion ? Or God knows what . My father once said , " We can be the captain of our ship but not of the sea . " What does that mean ? That we have to accept what the world hands us . And ourselves .

 . Here . - How very extraordinary ! - You found something ? Watch it . Nest of the lesser throated warbler . That 's usually found in the higher branches of an oak tree . Quite a fiind . But no sign of Sir Gerald or the Rolls . - He was at the wheel ? - I was right behind him . Was barely out of my sight . - Couldn 't have passed your chaps up front . - No tire marks . There 's a coincidence . The one we 're after is a bit bigger than that . a full-size Rolls can 't just vanish into thin air . But it did . If Sir Gerald was in the driving seat he can 't be far away . Who 's that ? That 's Dr. Chivers . Works in the testing area . Runs the Metal Fatigue Division . Didn 't know he collected butterflies ! Help ! He seems to have found something even if we haven 't . Lucky fellow ! Let me out ! What do you think ? Fresh . But not from the Rolls . The axle width is too narrow . That offside tire is badly worn . - Strange , parking here . - It overlooks the lane . From the Treasury , wasn 't he ? What brought him here ? I will shortly . I 've got someone working on it . Those tracks were found close by . One tire is worn smooth but ... Hexagonal multi-tread . I 've checked . They belong to an MT4 military truck . Help ! Let me out ! Morning , Professor Rushton . Has Sir Gerald arrived ? I 'm late . I don 't want to start off on the wrong foot . Sir Gerald 's been delayed . Weighed down with a load of rubbish . - Rubbish ? - Bureaucratic rubbish . Ministerial red tape . That kind of thing . I 'm very glad . I wanted to have a talk with you . I can 't wait to tell Sir Gerald . To see his face ! That 's what I want to talk to you about . - I really don 't think the time is right . - Why not ? - You said yourself , this is only a prototype ! - But it works . You 've seen it ! But you 've developed this project without ministry consent . That wasn 't my idea . We 're in testing , not a research department ! When I suggested you work in secret , I was only thinking of you . You knowthese civil servants . I 've suffered from them . They block you . You won 't get a penny . This invention is going to put you among the greats . Do you really think so ? Once it 's perfected . We don 't even know how it works ! We must test it and test again ! Without a word to anyone . - Not even your daughter . - Susan hasn 't the faintest idea . She has been questioning me about my expenditure . any problems with her , just refer her to me . That 's good of you . I should hate you to risk your job . The benefiits could be enormous . It 's worth taking a few risks . - What was that about " taking risks " ? - Nothing for you to worry about . Here 's something for you to worry about . Been overspending . - When Sir Gerald ... - He 's been delayed . He 's bound to turn up and he 'll want to know your unauthorized equipment orders . I admit I have taken a few shortcuts but for a very good reason . What ? I 'll ask Dr. Chivers . Can I help you ? I hope so . - It is Dr. Chivers , isn 't it ? - That 's right . - Have we met ? - at a distance . You were chasing butterflies at the time . Treasury ? Susan is ... Professor Rushton . This is Mr. Steed . My daughter Susan . Mr. Steed is from the Treasury . a dull job compared to yours , I 'm afraid . No , just routine . We test the endurance of metals . Corrode them , bombard them and even reduce them . To their basic elements . Once a weapon leaves we guarantee its survival on the battlefiield . Tomorrow 's demonstration , the Saracen FV603 . - I 'd like to go over the details ... - Don 't mind me . Perhaps , Miss Rushton would show me around . I 'd be happy to . If you 'll excuse us . This way , please . We were expecting Sir Gerald Bancroft to arrive . So were we . He vanished between the perimeter and the main gate . Vanished ? But I thought ... When did this happen ? a few hours back . He was on his way to audit accounts . Do look around . There 's the laboratory . . Do you assist your father ? Not directly . I work in administration . Could you supply me with an inventory ? Of the division 's equipment . That covers a wide fileid . How many military trucks do you have ? - Which specifiication ? - MT4s . There 's one allocated to the stores . - It 's parked out front , I believe . - I 've seen it. any others ? I can check . Why do you ask ? I 'm looking for one with a worn front tire . We found tracks where Sir Gerald disappeared . I 'm afraid the vehicle inventory doesn 't seem to be here . Get me John Steed . administration somewhere . I 'll wait . Hurry , will you ? Professor Rushton 's offiice . Who 's that ? It 's for you . Captain Gifford . Where are you ? You there ? Where are you ? are you all right ? Help ! Turn it off ! I can 't breathe ! I 'm slipping ! I can 't hold on ! It 's utterly incredible ! Two men and a Rolls vanish into thin air . I presume the area was thoroughly searched ? Inch by inch with the fiinest of toothcombs . It was ringed with a live wire the guards were armed to the teeth . Nobody could penetrate . What did you fiind out about Rushton ? Considered quite brilliant in his day , if a trifle eccentric . But with age creeping on he was put out to grass at the Fatigue Division . He stepped on a few political toes . Both may be disgruntled . But it still doesn 't account for the disappearances . Or their rising expenditure . We 'll fiind out about that in Rushton 's desk . His daughter 's got it under lock and key . That should prove no problem . There 's a demonstration today . Of the Saracen FV603 . The new alloy ? Extremely new . I gather we 're to attend . I shall . You 'll be engaged elsewhere . I 'd better get into my rifling-Rushton 's-desk kit . No sneaky moves ! There . Happier now ? This is the truck . There 's something odd going on here . I shouldn 't worry . Sir Gerald 's bound to turn up . When he does , you 'll be in serious trouble . I don 't think so . You 've spent thousands over the allocation . - It hasn 't been wasted , I promise . - Where 's the money gone ? When Mr. Steed was here , I lied for you . I covered up for you . I think you owe me an explanation . Very well . It all started by accident . I was testing an alloy , bombarding it with electrons . The machine went wrong so I had to improvise . You knowthe routine . We take measurements before and after . There 's usually shrinkage but this time it was more than fiive per cent . The rays from the improvised machine had reduced its size ! So I built a more powerful version . It 's here . There . That 's it . Where the money went . This machine can actually reduce matter and restore it to normal ! I know it sounds fantastic but take radio aeroplanes , television . Didn 't that seem inconceivable ... - ... a hundred years ago ? - It really works ? You don 't believe me , do you ? Look , I 'll show you . What shall we use ? Yes , this crate ! Here we go . There . It was money well spent . Don 't you agree ? I 'm not sure . Who 'll be at the demonstration ? The usual top brass plus a few observers from the other side . Isn 't that dangerous ? - They won 't walk off with an armoured car . - Someone walked off with a Rolls . If there is a connection , it 'll be interesting . Comrade Shaffer ? - What 's this ? - Your jacket . Fool ! This is an army demonstration . Today I 'm a general , not an admiral ! I 'm sorry , General ... sir . as a representative of our great country , am I to appear half naked ? another medal , you fool ! For bravery ! Conspicuous bravery ! Good morning , darling . Or is it good evening ? I thought you were a civilian . Who 's that ? How did she get here ? You brought her here last night . What lovely medals . Is this one for endurance ? - Get rid of her . - But , darling ! - Out ! - You haven 't shown me your icons ! This way , please . - What are you doing here ? - I want to talk to you . Get out of here ! I will not have you bursting in here . Bursting my head . - I 've been trying to see you for weeks . - Not today . I feel so fragile . I can help you ! Listen to me , will you ? I 'll listen . But , please ! a little lower with the voice . all right . My name 's Chivers . Matthew andrew Chivers , Doctor . You work at the Fatigue Division of the testing area to which I 've been invited today . You 're totally corruptible . I make it my business to fiind this out . We can talk business . What possible use are you to me ? The security of the area is beyond reproach . You would never be able to bring anything out ! You don 't think so ? What did you have in mind ? If this Saracen FV603 is as good as I hear I 'll take that ! It 's yours . You 'll have it after today . That 's impossible ! No . Mission highly improbable , I grant you not impossible . I observe a most infamous observer . - The general ? - Last time I met him , he was an admiral . His name 's Shaffer . - He 's versatile . - He 's head of intelligence . My dear fellow . What an unexpected pleasure ! It 's certainly unexpected . You look as if you 're entitled to a pension . Crimean War ? You 're very well-preserved . How very kind of you to say . Here she comes ! Gun crew , stand by . That 's your Saracen . Looks conventional . Conventional vehicle . Made of unconventional metal . What do you British say ? " The proof of the pudding " ? Stand by for a taste . Hang on , Sergeant ! Number 1 gun . Fire . Fire 2 . Fire 3 . Fire 4 and 5 . Fire 6 . Cease fiire . Some pudding ? Yes , indeed . Sorry we can 't part with the recipe . Come have a drink . There was a problem of reoccurring stress , but we 're using a new additive . Really ? I must say , it 's a very fline machine . Drinks are being served . I 'll be along soon . Wonderful vehicle . How are you going to remove it ? In your raincoat pocket ? Be honest ! You 've got nothing to match the Saracen FV603 ! One could hardly judge from such a brief inspection . Come along . You 're welcome to another look . That would be very kind . . No , please , Professor . More guardsmen over here ! Get to the perimeter ! - What 's happened ? - I don 't know . What are you doing here ? Give me security . Check all perimeter points ! Give me an immediate check . - all fences are intact . - Good . They can 't have got far . What is happening ? The Saracen . Someone has stolen it . What ? all visitors ? Everyone 's accounted for . Except John Steed . What about her ? - any news of the Saracen ? - Not a thing . You 're welcome to search me , if you like . That 's in order . She 's been through all your papers . She has no right , has she ? according to the pass , she has every right . Mrs. Peel is working for the Treasury . and what has happened to Steed ? I don 't know . and frankly , at this moment he 's not my fiirst concern . The Saracen , that 's the important thing . If that has fallen into enemy hands ... It appears I underestimated you . How did you do it ? - Where is it ? - I brought it with me . You what ? Where ? Here . What a perfect replica . But what did you do with the real one ? This is the real one . This is the one you saw being demonstrated . I took your advice . I brought it out in my raincoat pocket . In your raincoat pocket . Nowthe truth , the real truth . Rushton 's produced a machine . It reduces things . It sounds unbelievable . It did to me , at fiirst . How else do you think I got that out ? Take a look at it . Take a really close look . Believe me , this is the real thing . - lf you 're lying to me ... - lf you think that . I 'll fiind another buyer . That 's mud . and grass ! Miniature grass . No panic . Mustn 't panic . I have to inform my department . I 'm sending the Saracen FV603 to you in a cardboard box ! No panic . I can deal with this in a cool , calm , collected ordered , intelligent manner . I 'd better radio for instructions . Come with me ! You 're sure no one knows of Rushton 's work ? Positive . Not even his daughter . It 's clear he hasn 't realised its military signifiicance . With such a machine we could shrink opposing armies to the size of ants ! ants ! and then ... If we reduce a rocket to the size of a toy , howfar would it travel ? The possibilities are gigantic ! In a very small way . - The machine 's in the truck ? - It 's allocated to Rushton . Can 't get it without his pass . Then we must persuade him to deliver it personally . His daughter . He values her more than the machine . I suppose so . I 'll have her picked up . are you there ? What 's happened to you ? You wouldn 't believe it . I can hardly hear you . I 'm not surprised ! I haven 't got time to explain . Get over to Rushton 's daughter and stay with her ! Why ? Because she 's in danger . Rushton 's invented some kind of ... Who is that ? - Who 's speaking ? - Hello , who 's that ? What do you want ? Don 't joke with me , please . They 're here ! They 've got the girl ! - Speaking . Who 's that ? - That is of little concern at the moment . What should concern you is that we have your daughter . My daughter ? We will return her when you deliver your machine to us . Don 't you see ? They 've kidnapped Mrs. Peel and they think it 's me . You know you 're a fool . all right . Leave this to me . I 'm surrounded by fools ! So sorry you 've been troubled . a case of mistaken identity . It happens . - No hard feelings ? - None . You 're very kind . Consider yourself my guest . I can promise you a most diverting evening . Can 't wait . Yes , it 's me . It can 't be . It 's a dream . . If you insist . You 're real enough but ... how ? Rushton built some infernal machine . Chivers used it on the tank . and you just happened to be inside . How did you guess ? Tell me is everything to scale ? If you can get into a position where I can reach you . On the corner ! Will you move it further onto the desk ? any assistance in keeping it taut would be appreciated ! - What 're you doing ? - Destroying my notes . Then I 'll destroy the machine . I saw myself as a benefactor , but I 've created a terrible weapon . - and Mrs. Peel ? - I 'll notify the authorities . It 's clear that Chivers is behind it all . Correction ! Chivers is behind you . - How are we doing ? - another tug should do it ! Can 't let this through without a pass . - as a matter of fact ... - It 's all right . Carry on . How are we doing ? almost there . Under you go . The pen ! I must say , the pen is mightier than the sword ! Well , between us we 've written them off . I hate to tell you . Shaffer 's got the machine . Well done ! - That 's your little brainchild ? - Where 's Mrs. Peel ? You said ... You 'll be joining her later . It 's time for a practical demonstration . Careful ! Sorry . Where are we going ? I 'm trying to get you king-sized again . That summer house will do . You 'll reduce it and bring it back to size again . My pleasure . Hold on . Here 's your chance . Fantastic . amazing ! Quite amazing ! I congratulate you . Take them into the house . I 'm not sure I shouldn 't keep you like this . after all , it 's one way to bag a man . What happens now ? Stay and await developments . Big developments . Today , a summer house . Tomorrow , the world ! Let 's see your machine bring it back to size . Look . Leave this to me . - I presume you want her alive . - Of course . You 'd better put the machine in the house . Come with me . You 're going to need a magnifying glass to fiind her . But you are right . She 's around here somewhere . Don 't you worry . I 'll gather her up in my little net . Take him back to the house . an astonishing achievement ! Which I 'm sure our scientists can duplicate . It will guarantee us world domination ! But I cannot risk your being found here . If you 'll excuse me . I must arrange for your disposal elsewhere . My pleasure . - By disposal , I suppose he means ... - He does . - Oh , dear . - I 'd love to help but my hands are tied . If you 'll return the favour . If you don 't mind . Now , hold very still . There you are . - Well ? - Back to normal . Everything ? I can 't fiind her ! Forget it ! We can spray the whole grounds later . I can tell you one thing . We are going to be big men ! Have you got them ? Yes ! I think we 've cut them down to size . You English . Mini cars. and mini skirts . You never know when to stop ! How 's that ? Straighten her up a bit . Pity Rushton destroyed the machine . Could use it . Beam it and you could move everything about like in a doll 's house . Certain things I 'd love to see reduced . That monstrous apartment block , for a start . Government offiices . - Bank overdrafts . - Elephants . Bermuda shorts . Mini skirts . Wishful thinking , I 'm afraid . The notes are destroyed . He won 't build another . Never mind , we 'll console ourselves with a gigantic feast ! There 's a storm brewing . I 'd better get my coat . No need to worry . Take my brolly . Please , don 't bother . I 'll be all right . .

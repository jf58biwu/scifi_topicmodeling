 Why is it always my fault ? It 's not always your fault . Just almost always your fault . Now , give that amniox a bit of a twist , will you ? Not that far . Only about half as much . You know , Pilot said that this blockage was a byproduct of Moya 's pregnancy . It was probably caused by you firing that chemical-burning Earth pod in the transport hangar . Well , you don 't have to worry about that . That was the last of my fuel . I 'm totally dependent on your technology now . It 's not my technology . it 's Leviathan technology . D 'argo , I don 't give a rat 's ass what you want to call it . It 's your end of the universe . It 's your technology . Sure as hell ain 't mine . John , is something wrong ? Yep . I 'm fed up . " Fed up " ? I 'm sorry , is this going to be another translator microbe hiccup ? " Oh , John , you 're fed up . Does that mean that you 've had too many food cubes today ? " It was cute , it was vaguely , vaguely amusing the first six billion times . Something clearly is troubling you , John . Perhaps I can ... So , what , you 're going to help ? Is that it ? Maybe , before , when you were a priest . But guess what ? You resigned . Crichton , I don 't understand what you 're talking about . I 'm going for a drive . I 'm hitting the strip . I 'm going cruising . What 's going on ? I 'm getting some space , Aeryn and I 'm not talking about the space outside the ship . Look , this is hardly the time for human nonsense , Crichton . Oh , God , that is it . You are so damn smart . There 's no time for any stupid human anything . And I 'm sick of it , Aeryn . I 'm sick of Napoleon the Fourteenth , I 'm sick of Blue , I 'm sick of Tentacle Boy and guess what ? I 'm sick of you . I 'm sick of this whole turd-burp end of the universe . Crichton , I need you down here . This backwash is building up too fast . Moya is experiencing an extreme increase in her amnexus systems . She senses that her fetus is at risk . She 's decompensating . Decompensating . Oh , no . That means she 's going ... Prepare for immediate starburst . John . What 's he doing ? We must warn him . Pilot , get him back on board . No time . You guys are bugging out on me ? ! I hate starbursts . Oh , God , I am a dead man . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole ... Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship full of strange alien life-forms ... Help me ... Listen , please . Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Yeah ! Whoo-hoo ! Ha-ha ! Yes ! I wasn 't sure who to bet on , you or the shakloom . I wasn 't sure myself . You share with me ? In Acquara , the offering of food by a man to a woman signals his fondness for her . How do you take it ? Boiled or barbecued ? What 's that ? It is a map of the sky . Did you make that ? Yes , by the ancient charts of the Timbala . It is a gift for you . Oh , Lishala , I , uh ... That 's beautiful . Thank you . I , um ... thought you might show me where your home world is . My home world ? Well , let 's see . On this map , right about ... there . Lishala . Your father demands that you return to the village . Is it my father that demands it or you , Rokon ? When would you ever do as I demand ? When you learn to ask nicely . You can teach him that . I see you took a shakloom . Too bad . A baby . Don 't take them smaller than this . Right . This is Lishala 'a map of the sky . Why did she give it to you ? I guess she thought it might help me find my way home . She 's never given me such a gift . Rokon , you don 't need a map to get home . You know you 'll never go home . Not from Acquara . You 're probably right . But this is the first place I 've been that makes me feel I can live with that . But the question is , can Acquara live with you ? The grondeer wants to see you . Be there at high sun . So , another green planet in yet another unnamed system . Crichton must have landed somewhere . Moya 's starburst data says that this planet is on an exact reverse trajectory . Along with every other system we 've been through in the last quarter of a cycle . D 'argo , we have to admit to ourselves . Whatever happened to John is his own doing . He shouldn 't have left Moya in the time of crisis . We drove him to it . All of us . Have you become so cold ? Cold , perhaps , but also practical . We all grow weary of this search , and it places us in greater danger of being discovered by the Peacekeepers . I still care about Crichton . The only reason this search still drags on is because of the guilt in your own hearts . My hearts are private places . Stay out of them . Aeryn , you have a voice in this , too . Fine . I say we keep looking , for now . You know , D 'argo , there will come a time where we may have to acknowledge that Crichton has met his destiny and we 're just not part of it . Then I will wait for you to tell me when to abandon the search . When we abandon Crichton . Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! A - lu-e-masata . A - lu-e-masata . Ah , my honored guest has arrived . Shai , shai ! Shai ! Enough ! A - lu-e-masata . A - lu-e-masata . You learn our ways , John Crichton . Ah , they 're not so different from my own . Go . I want to talk in private . Come . Sit . Beside you ? I know . It 's a privilege awarded only to my best hunters . I wouldn 't wish to dishonor them . But by refusing , you dishonor me . Come . Sit . We have much to discuss . You see ? Not a bad place to sit . So , you said we have much to discuss ? Yes . For instance ... impulsive flights of my daughter 's heart . You see the way she comes alive when she looks at you ? When I look at her , I see a friend . If it should become more than that , you need to understand ... Kato-Re . I deeply appreciate the way your people have welcomed me , but I chose to build my home away from the village because I do not want to interfere in your ways . Amongst our people , it is the female who chooses which male she will mate with for life . It may be out of your hands , my dear Crichton . Huh . It appears the grondeer has invited the stranger to sit beside him . When was the last time he invited you ? Only once , when I asked his permission to attract Lishala . It is obvious Lishala feels culleh for the stranger . And now he sits in your rightful place . I am not blind , mother . Oh , not blind . But perhaps weak ? I am first among the hunters . As my son , you are more than any hunter . You are part of the Priestan lineage , and someday you could be grondeer of Acquara . I 'm seeing to that . But only if you marry Lishala . I want to marry her , but not for your reasons . How can I control the way she feels ? I 'm talking about rule of all of this , and you can 't even master the heart of one foolish girl ? You will do whatever is necessary to insure that no one stands between you and our family 's destiny . Do you understand ? This is the worst Pod landing I ever experienced . Where did you learn to fly ? We lost all power and dropped the last 20 units . You 're telling me . Pilot , we 're heads-up on the planet . We caught a glimpse of Crichton 's module during our last pass . I acknowledge , D 'argo . Excellent news . I will inform the others . In the meantime , Moya 's having trouble pinpointing your signal . Can you activate your homing ident so she can read ... Pilot ... Pilot ! Communication 's been terminated . Another power loss . Ooh ! Ohh ! Ohh ! Oof ! Oh ! Something 's draining all power . D 'argo ? Where are you going , hmm ? I insist you wait for me ! It 's a simple matter , Aeryn . Either you or I jet down there to try and pick up a visual where we lost contact . We didn 't lose contact , Zhaan . Contact was severed . D 'argo confirmed that he found Crichton 's module . Then he was gone . Which is why we must act quickly . Not without more data . We 're already down one Transport Pod . Let 's not make it two . They could be hurt or need medical attention , or even reinforcements , Aeryn . You were a lot more agreeable as a peace-loving priest . As I assume were you as a Peacekeeper pilot . I didn 't give up my calling . You did . My personal decision to put aside the spiritual seek is none of your business . I warn you fairly , Aeryn . Do not go there . Is that a threat ? I will only tell you once . There are lines we should never cross . Now , I strongly suggest we concentrate on the problem at hand . " before you go into battle know your enemy . " It is not a battle , Aeryn . It is a rescue . From what ? There should be some sort of thermal register from the Pod 's propulsion systems , but there 's nothing . Well , then I suggest we find out why . Fine . Because if we don 't , we 're all we have left . A - lu-e-masata . Just passing through . Is there a problem here ? Rokon . What 's the deal ? Damn it ! Rokon ... I know you do not mean to be an enemy , but you interfere with our ways . I 'm not trying to interfere . I 'm just trying to live my life , alone . Then why do you poison Lishala 's heart ? Rokon , you and Lishala , you 've got nothing to worry about from me . But I have to be sure I have nothing to worry about from Lishala . You smell like dren . You look like dren . Get the hell away from me . We came back for you . That 's supposed to be a good thing ? You 'd rather those guys have danced all over your face . Yeah , I would . And wherever you came from , go back . That 's when he came flying in , swinging his powerful blade . This ... man-creature , a full samat bigger than Talio or Ku-mah with tentacles and tattoos all over his head . You see ? This stranger , this Crichton , infects us like a parasite . Already , he brings more evil into our midst . Remember , our ancestors were space travelers too . We are but colonists here ourselves . Then you will embrace this man-creature as you 've embraced the stranger ? Perhaps you will invite him also to bed with your daughter . Mother ! You will not dishonor my daughter . It 's all right . She knows nothing of my heart , and less of my sleeping habits . She should only get some of her own . You try the limits of your rank , Neera . Remember , you address the grondeer . Remember , your office depends upon the sanction of mine . Do not show weakness here , Kato-Re . Our people will not stand for it . Uh-uh-oh-uh-ah ... Crichton , you 're alive ! No thanks to you . Get up . You 're outta here . This isn 't the happy reunion I 'd planned on . I didn 't plan on one at all . Not after you abandoned me . Is that what you really think happened ? You 're the one . Practically sabotaged poor Moya , then blasted out of there like a barkan out of Hezmana . I get a little stressed out and the second I 'm off the ship , boom ! You guys starburst the hell out of there . Moya starburst on her own . You forced her to decompensate when you failed to release the pressure on her amnexus systems . Do you really think we abandoned you , when we spent the last quarter of a cycle searching for you ? This whole time , the last three months . You came back . To look for me . A lapse of sound judgment I 'll regret for the rest of my life . Yeah , you just might . The rest of your life . We 'll all regret it if we don 't deal with this negative power vortex . Which means what , exactly ? If it uses power , it doesn 't work . Ooh ! We 're stuck here ? Oh ! No power . No comforts . No defenses . Sounds like paradise . Zhaan . Wake up , Zhaan . I 'm not sleeping , I 'm increasing my work efficiency with a Delvian wanta chant . Oh . This might help . Come and have a look . Pilot just produced it . Ah ! Good . It 's a topographic bio-print . Still too generalized , though . Too generalized for what ? Since Moya can 't pick up any power signals from the planet she 's concentrating instead on biological markers . What we need to do is isolate the most highly developed organisms . Oh well , that rules out the three we 're looking for . Yes , well , even if we can locate them the problem is , how do we help them ? I 've been thinking about that . We need some kind of shielded power source , something that 's hot enough to run their Transport Pod , that can be built into a projectile . How do we send it in where we can do most good ? Well , you locate the target and I 'll hit it . Anyway , thank God I found this planet . This system . You thought you would stay here the rest of your life . I haven 't stopped thinking that . Look around , D 'argo . There 's a lot worse places . Since I left my home , I 've been hunted , beaten , locked up , shanghaied , shot at . I 've had alien creatures in my face , up my nose , inside my brain , down my pants ... This is the first time , the first place , where I 've found peace . Lishala . Don 't be afraid . Who are you ? Lishala , this is D 'argo . D 'argo , Lishala . Why did you bring him here ? I ... I didn 't bring him . He came on his own . As a friend . Rokon accused your friend of attacking his brothers . That is a lie . They ambushed Crichton . It 's lucky I showed up when I did . You 've done nothing to harm us since you came . Why do they wish to hurt you ? Lishala , Rokon believes that ... your heart strays my direction . Perhaps he 's right . No , no . Look , you and I , that 's , uh ... that 's not a good idea . You must go to my father at once and convince him that your friend D 'argo is not a threat . Come . I 'll take you . D 'argo ! This way . D 'argo ! No ! Stop ! What are you doing ? Let me go ! Rokon ! Tell them to let me go ! Let me go ! Rokon ! Stop it ! She set us up . No , she didn 't ! So shut up . I told you , they don 't mean us any harm ! Why won 't you listen to me ? Rokon ! Rokon ! Let go of me ! You are charged with the crime of assault against the personal guards of the grondeer . Gracious grondeer , I 've always told you the truth . This whole thing started when you asked me to sit beside you . It made Rokon think that I was trying to steal Lishala 's heart . That 's a lie ! Enough ! My daughter 's heart is not an object to be possessed or stolen . She is free to give it as she chooses . Try telling him that . It 's the stranger that disrupts our peace ! And now his ally , this man-creature , threatens our very safety . The crime of assault against my personal guards carries the sentence of death . No ! Please . I know they 're not dangerous . Please , they 're no threat ... Be quiet or be removed ! But since I believe you are not entirely at fault , you shall be banished to work the compound at Lomata-kai for a period of ten cycles . Kato-Re , you are wrong . Grondeer , I remind you , the law is very explicit . The law is my domain . Seize that ! Here ! What do you have in there ? It is him ! A - lu-e-masata ! It 's him . Look . A - lu-e-masata ! So glad you could join us , Your Eminence . Hmm ? Masata . Masata . A - lu-e-masata ... Crichton , what the frell is going on ? I think ... They think ... you 're God . No . Not a God , but a sovereign . Oh , it 's perfectly understandable . My , uh ... um , uh , my empire included tens of thousands of planets and species . This simply must be one of them . You know , this grondeer 's hut is really quite comfortable . We are nowhere near Hyneria . We are in the Uncharted Territories . What are your subjects doing all the way out here ? There 's no telling how far my influence extends . May we , Your Eminence ? Hmm ? May you what ? We 're here to bathe you . You may go . I 'll see to it that no more harm comes to you . Mmm ... Ah ... Tickles . How 's it going ? Well , I 've almost finished with the projectile . But the shielded power source is another matter entirely . I don 't know enough of the necessary science to build it . Can 't believe this , but I need Crichton . Well , Moya 's isolated bio-prints of the most complex life-forms . See this orange marks here . They indicate habitat . A settlement , possibly a village . And the dark area ? Well , according to Pilot it 's the focal point of negative power drain . But look , these three marks here . Three distinct life-forms . Clearly different from all the others . Is it possible ? Crichton , D 'argo , Rygel . Well , we know where to send this , but I have no shielded power source to pack on board . However , we can use it to point them in the right direction . Mmmm ... Oh , this is too , too much . Keep it coming . Fruit , shakland jerky , oh , ohh ! Excuse me , Your Eminence . Oh . Shoo-shoo , shoo . Enter . Your loyal subjects are preparing a little celebration for you . Excellent . Where they officially accept you as their masata and you fulfill your part in the Prophesy . Hmm ? Which part of what Prophesy ? That 's what we 're trying to find out . They don 't like talking to strangers about their religion . Religion ? Dah ! I told you , I 'm their Dominar , not their god . Well , they don 't think so . They think you 're some kind of savior . Huh ? Your Eminence . Doesn 't anybody knock ? A - lu-e-masata , most humble masata , forgive me . Your grand celebration is being prepared . Ah , yes , of course . Where I 'm expected to fulfill my part in the Prophesy . Now , for my part in the Prophesy , I shall require the sacred text . The Timbala ? Yes , yes , the Timbala . It is written in the ancient language . There are very few who can read it . Only Priestan , like myself , and of course , you . Hmm ... I look forward to the honor of officiating at the celebration . How did you know about the sacred text ? Where were you brought up ? Every religion 's got one . Look , relax . The answer to this whole masata thing must be in here somewhere . Can you read it ? It 's in the ancient Hynerian . I had a coterie of tutors all through my youth who did nothing but instruct me in the ancient language . Can you read it ? I will try . Hey . Are you immortal too , like the masata ? When were you going to tell me ? I thought we had a future together . Lishala ... our futures were never meant to be one . Doesn 't matter anyway . Now that he 's come , all our futures are different now . It is written in the Prophesy . Lishala , what is the Prophesy ? He 's the masata . Through the Priestan , he 's protected us , guided us , ruled us throughout our exile on this planet . Later , after the celebration he 'll rise up and lead us to the light . Wait . You think that Rygel is going to take you off this planet ? Whether we want to go or not . Lishala , Rygel is not a spiritual being . He doesn 't have any special powers . That 's not true . We 've worshipped his idol for generations . And now he has returned , just as it 's written in the Timbala . Your Timbala , your beliefs , they 're wrong . - A flesh and blood Dominar ... - No ! has been presented to you as some kind of a god . It 's not true . If he is the real masata , he 'll rise up and lead us to the light . If he does not prove himself the true masata tonight , he will suffer a torturous death beyond any other and so will you . The party 's just getting started . Looks like you 're the guest of honor . Rygel , you 'd better find something we can use . The ancestors of these people , these Acquarans , they were colonists , sent out from my empire during the reign of Rygel the Tenth . They were meant to expand the influence of my people 's monarchy . And they were ... they were abandoned . Rygel the Tenth sent them here . Then he ... Rygel , what ? Whatever 's causing the power drain across the planet is intentional . There 's some sort of device sent by my empire that purposely keeps these people on this planet so that they can 't travel , can 't learn of other cultures . Can 't be anything other than the blind followers of the family of Rygel . What 's this about you being some kind of masata ? A lot of this is new . The Priestans have made it up . Elevated my ancestors and me to gods , to elevate themselves . But I must tell them . Explain . I 'm Rygel the Sixteenth . They must listen . Rygel , look at them out there . They aren 't preparing for the return of a worldly king . They 're preparing for the return of their savior . Then we 're frelled . Well akuna matata , masata . We 've got a big problem . They 're all expecting slug-man here is going to rise up and lead them into the light . We know . It is written in the Timbala . It 's a metaphor , that 's all . A - a colorful bit of descriptive language to infer the guiding of people to a better way of life . Listen , Rygel . To these people it 's not any damn metaphor . They are burning their possessions . They are expecting you to rise up and part the heavens . But I ... I can 't do that . I ... I ... ohh ! No ! No wait ! I command you ! Great . This current bio-print reading shows all three targeted life-forms are very close to the vortex sight . Right . Let 's drop it right in their laps . Programming targeting coordinates . Clear to launch . Now . She 's on optimal trajectory . If everything goes smoothly we should have contact in ... We 've lost her . It 's the power vortex . No signal , no data , no contact . She is gone . So , now all we can do is wait . And pray for a miracle . - People of Acquara ! - Loyal subjects . In this time of ... of ... hope , of , uh of greater understanding , it is my wish that you will understand that we have much to accomplish together , as a united people before , um , and , uh ... by my hand uh ... I shall rise up and lead you to the light . So , as we embark together on this great journey forward , uh , could , uh , take a very long time . No ! It is written that the masata will rise up and lead us to the light . But that 's just a metaphor . Uh ... uh ... and as your leader , your Dominar , I command that you should wait ... The sacred Timbala does not command us to wait ! It states without question , by the hand of the masata shall he rise and lead us to the light . Rise and lead us to the light . Rise up and lead us to the light ! Listen ! Listen to me ! I ... I ... I can 't ! False god . He 's not the masata ! False god ! Ouch . False god ! False god ! But I never was a god ! Seize him ! Crichton ... D 'Argo , let me go ! Crichton ! Crichton , help me ! For God 's sake , D 'argo ! They 're going to fry Rygel . We 'll be no help to anyone if they fry us too . Okay , I give up . What is it ? It 's from Moya . Thermal storage casing . Looks like the girls are trying to send us a message . That 's coordinates . You have been wronged ! Horribly wronged by my empire ! I admit that ! But your belief that I am a god is also wrong ! Let me explain ! Please ! Let me explain ! It is how it must be . No , it is not . Why can 't we decide our own fate ? Make our own rules ? Whaa ... Stop ! Poor Rygel . Let him go . You 've been betrayed . All of you . You 've been forced to live on this planet against your will as were your ancestors before you . Don 't listen to him . There is a device . A device which drains all power sources . It keeps your machinery from working . There is no device . This device sends an invisible pulse which blankets the entire planet 's surface . No ! When your ancestors first arrived at this planet their starships functioned , as did all the machines that they left behind . But you 've been lied to . First by those who left you here and then by the Priestans . You dare attack the Priestans ? ! That 's the highest sacrilege . No ! The highest sacrilege is purposely keeping your own people ignorant and subjugated for your own glorification ! Lies ! You have no proof of anything ! Yes , I have ! In the Timbala . But only the Priestans have read it . If it is true , that would mean the Priestans have lied to us for generations . That cannot be . Kill him , Rokon . He 's mad , just kill him . Don 't , Rokon . - Kill him , Rokon . - Don 't ! Kill him , Rokon ! If what you are saying is true then where is this device ? Where is it ? ! I 'm not entirely sure Rokon , but the people from my ship just sent the coordinates . Just give me a chance to find it ... " By the hand of the masata shall he rise up and lead us to the light ! " Sparky , you 're up ! D 'argo ! Rygel , the impression ! Your hands ! Right there ! Masata . A - lu-e-masata . No . Cease . I command it . I have not risen . I am not a deity . I am but a worthy being like yourselves . But I am your sovereign . A - lu-e-masata . A - lu-e-masata . A - lu-e-masata . The slug who would be king . A - lu-e-masata . I wish you could stay here with us , Dominar . Oh , as do I , my friend . As do I. But I must continue on my journey . And if those Peacekeepers I mentioned should arrive here ... We shall tell them nothing of your visit . Provisions for your journey ? Hmm ? Oh , oh , this is so generous . I ... I wish I had more of a gift for you . You 've given us the greatest gift of all , Dominar Rygel . You 've given us our freedom . Now we can stay in our beloved Acquara . And so you do not forget us , we 've prepared you a special gift . Shakloom jerky . Mmmm ? Yeah ? Go on . Eat it . You take care of her , Rokon . I will . Your mother , will she ... ? She will survive her displacement . You 've often said you love this place . Why don 't you stay and help us rebuild ? I wish I could . But my future is with my own kind . I 'll continue my journey . We 'll miss you . Crichton ! It 's time to go . Gotta go . Guess I got some apologies to make up on the ship . Zhaan , Aeryn , you . Forget about that . Was it worth the trouble , human ? Hah ... What trouble ? Let 's hit the road .

Who the hell are you ? Mr. Lyle . And Bridget is the new cleaner . What am I , in the twilight zone ? We thought It would be a good idea to have Bridget provide assistance in the capture of Jarod . All I know is that he is barking a lot of orders and all the smart people seem to be following them . Maybe he 's part of the Triumvirate . The Triumvirate ? What the hell would they be doing here ? Seizing power ? Their appearance certainly would explain your father 's disappearance . Why would they make my father disappear ? Because someone shot Raines . They are not going to stop until they find out who did . Who is Mr. Lyle ? He 's the boogeyman . The money was removed from the Center offices on the home through electronicly We 're double checking the transfer records . We 're hoping its an accounting mistake . Jarod stole fifteen million dollars of Centre funds and donated it to charity . The only mistake is rubbing our noses in it . ¡ ° Your welcome and surprisingly generous donation will help the organisation for years to come . ¡ ± ¡ ° The million dollars will bring much hope and joy to the children . God Bless . ¡ ± ¡ ° Prayers be with you . Have a nice day . ¡ ± I 'll get him . Please do . Jarod 's a lot more dangerous than I thought . I like ice cream . I really like ice cream . - There you go Jarod . - Thank you Phil . Very interesting device . It 's a Wheelo . And it 's purpose is ? Nothing . It just goes round and round and round . So it chases itself in a circle ? Yep ! Would you be interested in selling that for ten dollars . Sorry ! Fifteen ? I couldn 't . My grandpa gave it to me for my birthday . - Twenty ? - Twenty-five ! Sold ! Thank you ! Wow ! Hey Kiddo ! Got you a burger , some fries . Gonna set you up nice here . Okay sir . Hey ! I 'll be right back . Okay ? How are you doing Scooter ? Dewey !

You do as your daddy says now , okay ? - But ... - Just go , please . I see your dilemma . The deal is one job and you and I are history . Why don 't you get Martinez ? Dead . He said no . Crew ? The three of us plus one . Who opens the safe ? Trinnie 's sending some guy in from Brooklyn . One , um , R.H. Cross . Cross . I don 't know him . I don 't know him either . Trinnie swears by him even though he 's only got one good arm . A one armed safe cracker . That 's ... I 'm picking him up at three o 'clock at the train station . We start tonight . Scottie , don 't be late . - Hey ! Okay . - What 's that ? No . No . It 's nothing . These guys come back and give me a hard time . Hey nothing 's wrong . Hey ! Come here . The train station . Leaving town ? Business meeting . Yeah ? What do you do ? I 'm a one armed safe cracker . Yeah ? Which arm ? It 's a good question . There are pretends among us . Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be . In 1963 , a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod , and exploited his genius for their research . Then one day , the pretender run away ... THE PRETENDER Season 2 Episode 2 Scott Free Jarod is at something . I can feel it coming on like the flu ' . After his recent brush with death perhaps he 's just enjoying life for a bit . Maybe he decided to take a vacation . Did you eat the whole onion for breakfast ? - Broots . - What ? Sorry you missed the party in Omaha . Jarod . What about Omaha ? Whoops ! I guess the Centre cut you out of the loop this time . Good thing they sent a replacement . What are you talking about Jarod ? I 'm talking about the blonde . Five ¨ C seven , hundred and twenty pounds , killer legs . You 're not giving up on me , are you Miss Parker ? You wish . Your attention please . - Announcing the immediate arrival of the Brooklyn Express at platform sixteen . - That 's my train . Gotta go . What was that all about ? That 's what I 'd like to know . R.H. Right hand . Avani ? Don 't look around . We 're being watched . Cops ? Listen up . I 'm only going to say this once . The location 's changed . The new score is in Indianapolis . I 'm from Flatbush . I don 't know anything about Iowa . Indiana . Same thing . I wrote down the locations , the security codes , the whole deal . Hey this ain 't kosher . I need to call Trinnie . You do that and you lose this . You get another package just like it when the job is finished . Target ? That 's my business . I 'm gonna meet you in four days at the Hotel Argyle in New York . I 've reserved a room in your name . What 's to keep me from walking away with the whole thing ? You do that and I 'm gonna hunt you down like I did Martinez . Then they 'll be calling you ¡ ° No Hands ¡ ± . That 's cold . Your attention please . - Announcing the immediate departure of the Indiana Star . - That 's your ride . I want you to leave this at the job . What is it ? It 's a Hallmark card . Always send the very best . Leave it . My tools are in there . Buy new ones . Because every cop along the line is looking for a man with a bum arm carrying a black leather bag . I 'll take the bag and the heat . How are you going to do that ? See you in New York . See you in New York . See you in New York . Your attention please . Will Mr Paul Johnson , please meet your party ... Mr Cross . Call me R.H. Why wasn 't I informed about Omaha ? No , no , no . Switch those masks , please . With due respect Miss Parker , it 's not my job to inform you of Jarod 's whereabouts . It 's your job to inform me . - According to your file ... - My file ? Correct . According to your file you 've had Jarod trapped in Las Vegas , Chicago , Washington and Florida . It seems you 've had ample opportunity to bring him back . How would you like me to feed you my file . There 's no reason to be defensive about your shortcomings Miss Parker . Moving in ? Possession is nine-tenths . Now if you 'll excuse us we have a meeting to attend . Oh , any progress locating your missing father ? Who says he 's missing ? A man packs his belongings and vanishes it 's a logical assumption . You gave that paper weight to your father when you were a little girl . I thought he threw it away . I 'm sure he 's fine . He would never just leave without saying goodbye , would he ? You 're dead and the rest of us are in handcuffs . Twenty minutes . That 's all the time we got before security guard makes his run . You 're going to have to work faster to bypass that second alarm . I 'm working as fast as I can . There was a day when you could have done it in your sleep . Remember those days Dewey ? Scooter was the best I ever saw . Sixteen years old , picking combination locks down at the YMCA ¨ C stealing wallets and jock straps . What did you do with all those jock straps ? You know , it was a long time ago , Nick . I took you off the streets . I treated you like you were my own son . Yeah ! And when the heat was on you hang me out to spend seven years in a federal prison . Forgive me if I don 't shed a tear about how things used to be . I think we should cut him loose . This job is going to be difficult enough in a perfect world . I don 't need a guy with his head half in the game . I know him . You on the other hand are a question mark . Should I call Trinnie and get another locksmith ? Nah ! Let 's try it again . Long night huh ? Yeah ! Let 's pick this up tomorrow night at my place . - You got a pen . I 'll write down the address . - Yeah . Oh thanks . Oh here . Eight one six Highland . Eight one six Highland . ¡ ° To Dad , Love Sean ¡ ± . Is that your son ? My life . He gave me this for father 's day . Come along Jarod . Miss Parker just gave that man a present Sydney ? Why ? It 's father 's day Jarod . She gave her father a gift to show how much she loves him . You want me to put this out on the net for you ? Oh yeah . I want to know who he is and where he comes from . I bet my pension there 's someone out there looking for this guy . The part is still going to be the rent-a-cops Oh I never thought I 'd need this again . What ? Can 't open a door you blow it off its hinges ? You never know what you might run into . Sometimes looking dangerous is enough . Sean , what are you doing here ? I live here . No . No . You know what I mean . You 're supposed to be at Mrs Albertson 's . I went to the shop . They said that you didn 't show up today . No I didn 't . Actually that was my fault . I saw some of the furniture your father built and I suggested we meet right away . My name is Cross . RH Cross . RH stands for Right Hand . What 's that stuff ? Oh well you never mind that stuff . If your probation officer catches you skipping work you 're going to be in big trouble . I don 't want anything to happen to us . Who 's ... . who 's the father here . Now I want you to go back to Mrs Albertson 's house and you stay there ¡ ® til I pick you up . - But ... - Just do what I say ... Wait , wait , wait . Sean . Hey . Listen . I just ... I just need you to cut me a little slack here . Hey ! I love you . I love you too . See you Right Hand . Nice to meet you Sean . So why are you doing this ? What ? Why are you doing this job ? You don 't want to be doing it . Which means that Avani is holding some sort of big hammer over your head . Oh I never knew my parents . Sean 's mother passed away after he was born and I was sent up a year later , you know . They passed Sean around from family to family like I was . But you got him back . And I intend to keep him . Sean needs his father forever . Jarod . You need to finish the last simulation . I made this for you Sydney . For me ? Do you like it ? No Jarod , I don 't like it and I don 't want to ever see anything like it again . Let 's get to work . We just received these from our satellite office in Indianapolis . His name 's RH Cross . He 's a safe cracker from New York . And we should be interested because . . ? According to the office Cross 's take was nearly a quarter million dollars . He also left this behind . According to the red notebook Cross was going to rendezvous with Jarod at the Argyle Hotel in New York City . Jarod would never leave such an obvious trail . Cross screwed up and left that behind . That 's quite a reach . According to the security on the ground in Indianapolis Cross was nearly caught . Bridget go to New York . Find Cross . I still don 't understand the significance of this . Jarod 's sending you two a message . Which is ? You 're going nowhere fast . We got eighteen minutes until the security guard makes his round . I don 't like this . That van followed us ever since we left the warehouse . - The cop 's have made us . - If they have then they 're still following Dewey all over the city . I 've got every contingency covered . Let 's just do it . How long ? Five minutes . You 've got three . What the hell is that ? He 's early . Twenty minutes huh ? What is it ? The guard . How long before you 're in ? Two minutes . Oh . What are you going to do ? I 'm covering contingencies . I 'm in . You stole an electronic key card ? It opens the federal diamond depository in Wilmington . What are you talking about ? He 's saying there is no money . Just another job . That 's what this has been about since the very beginning . Right ? Twenty million dollars in raw uncut diamonds . My source says that the stones will spend thirty-six hours in the vault before distribution . We move on Monday before the offices open up and anyone realises the access card is missing . Our deal was one job . I 'm out . I 'm sorry to hear that Scottie . Change your mind the door 's always open . Best laid plans huh ? I 'll see you tomorrow . Dewey , this is Nick . Hey ! You okay ? Oh , I 'm fine . Good . I guess this sort of thing happens when you deal with a piece of work like Avani . What 's wrong ? This is too easy . - What is ? - This . Nick would never let me walk out with this much on the line , not unless ... You got a car ? Yeah , come on . Sean . Sean . Sean . Answer me . The house is empty . I 'm really sorry Scottie but there 's no way I can let this opportunity slip away . I need you . Your Sean is safe . How safe he stays is up to you . Research five took it off the National Police Net . Why would Jarod 's picture be on a law enforcement scan ? Well according to the background data he 's suspected of being part of a robbery group here in the North East . What did you say ? The initial scan was sent by a detective Harold Evans of the Middletown PD Middletown ? That 's less than a hundred miles from here . The question now is what is Jarod doing associating with a group of street criminals . Well actually this crew is slicker than that . They have an MO of targeting high profile , high tech takedowns . Such as ? Such as , um , payroll companies , security houses , mostly diamonds . Run profiles on all the potential targets within a five hundred mile radius of The Centre . Everything this crew might be interested in and I want everything you can find on this Detective Evans . If he stole a Baby Ruth when he was six I want to know how many nuts it had . I 've been going over the layout of the vault room . I 'm thinking we 've got a better chance of blowing the inner doors . Sounds right . What do you think Scottie ? I want him back . I 'm here right ? That 's what you wanted . Now you give me back my boy . Focus , for the kid 's sake . These doors are only reinforced steel so we should ... Where my son is . And I want to know right now . You pull the trigger on me , you pull the trigger on Sean . Scottie let him go . Where 's Sean ? Where 's my boy ? We finish this job you and Sean 'll be back together again , I promise . Give me the gun . Give me the gun ! Anything happens to my boy , you 'll wish I 'd killed you . Never underestimate the father-son relationship . Jarod , I told you , I can 't accept this . But I made it for you . I 'm not your father . This card is meant for someone else . Don 't you love me Sydney ? We have work to do . It smells like gin in here . What the hell is this ? I don 't have the time or inclination to banter with you detective so I will get right to the point . You got a name ? Let 's just say that I 'm the person who holds your pitiful little life in her hands . Is that so ? You tell me . Go ahead , open it . Where 'd you get these ? That 's not important . What is , is that multiple copies are in my possession . Good . You put this picture out on the police net . So ? I want him . Can 't help you . I want him ! Harold . I 'm sorry for both our sakes . I think I know where they 're gonna hit next . Relax your prostate boys . We 've got Jarod nailed to the wall . The blonde 's gonna bust a G-String when she ... What ? Please continue . And while you 're at it , maybe you can explain this . I spoke to RH Cross in New York . He was sent to rob the Centre 's office in Indianapolis by a man matching Jarod 's description . We did try to warn you about that . And how was Detective Evans ? You had me followed ? Yes I did . And I want to know everything you know and I want to know now . Jarod 's become part of a robbery crew . Evans thinks their next target will be the Federal Diamond Depository in Wilmington . I think we should blanket the area and grab the whole bunch on the way in . I disagree . Oh what a surprise . You have a better plan ? You 've tried the open snare approach before . Jarod 's too smart to let us grab him on the outside . You let him inside the vault , lull him into a false sense of security and get him ... clean . Why don 't we just mail him the diamonds and call it a day . I know Jarod , the way he thinks . Yet you still can 't catch him . Ladies ! We follow Bridget 's plan . Mr Broots you 'll be given complete control of the security system at the diamond depository . You can do that ? suggest you visit the building and begin implementing a total lockdown of the facility . I don 't believe this will work . I think it 's time to end this pursuit of Jarod once and for all . You can do that ? Dewey got these photos of the Depository this morning and the keycard will allow us to penetrate the outside security system . Bodies on the ground ? Minimal . I made the lock system this morning . It 's hard wired infra-red . Can you beat it ? Yeah ! I can beat it . We have no problem then . Oh no . Not now . What did you say ? Ah Nothing . You look a little shook up . No . No I 'm fine . We 're all set then . Oh no . The coloured areas represent access points at the depository . When the grid is red the building is locked down . When it 's green obviously it 's not . My guess is that Jarod and his crew will disarm the video monitoring system as soon as they gain entry but it won 't matter though because I 'm the only one with the password to the system . Very impressive Mr Broots . I 'm confident that Mr Broots has covered all contingencies . Are you confident Mr Broots ? Here we go ! Alright . They 're inside . Let 's end this . Not yet . Not yet ? He 's sitting there waiting for us ... And knowing that gives us the upper hand . The advantage of surprise . Your point ? We have him Mr Lyle . Let 's not make another mistake . What is that ? What 're are you doing ? I could stop and could explain it to you or I could just do it and get the hell out of here . The choice is yours . Jarod would never have walked in here without a plan to walk out . We stay the course . Look , you want to sit on your collective thumbs , fine . I 'm going to do my job . I won 't allow you to compromise this situation . You 're going to shoot me ? Done . What happened ? Drill bit cracked . - You got another one ? - Yeah in my bag . - I 'll get it . - No . No No . I 'll get it . I know where it is . Pull out the broken bit . Make it fast . Scottie , give me a hand over here will you ? Just one second . I 'm nearly done . Now . Yeah ! Sure . Hey ! You open these doors . I want Scottie 's son brought back to him . Open the doors . What are you doing ? Maybe you don 't understand English . I want Sean released . I know Dewey 's got him so you call him and you tell him to cut him loose . You open the door or you die . Go ahead . Tell him Scottie . Nick don 't . Shoot . You see , sometimes looking dangerous is enough and sometimes it 's not . Now call him ! Dial ! This is Nick . Let the kid go . Yes ! Right now ! The phone ? Hm , hm , hm . You should have called Trinnie . Scottie , you let me out of here . You know , every night for ah , seven years I thought about , you know , what you were doing . And then when I get out , finally get my life back , you take my son ? Scottie that was business . This is personal . Let 's get out of here . Don 't leave me here . Scottie ! Scottie ! Don 't leave me here ! Scottie ! Hey ! I 've got two on the move . Jarod . Give me my gun . If you want Jarod , give me my gun . Tell the sweeper teams to move . Wait . What the hell is this ? All the access points in the building are unlocking . One area 's still secured ? What 's that ? Sean ! Sean . Sean ! Sean . Sean ! Scottie ! Sean . Oh ! Oh ! Oh my God ! Like I was so scared , you know . Are you okay ? I 'm okay . You 're fine ? You 're fine ? Dad , don 't make a big deal . Oh ! Oh ! Look , I hate to break this up but don 't you think you two should be hitting the road ? Here , take this with you . Don 't worry , it 's money that was owed to me . Ah , you know , I don 't understand . Consider it an early father 's day present . Good luck huh ? Thanks . Good luck . Sydney . Hope your stay at the depository wasn 't too unpleasant ? You made quite an impression on the new regime . I hope this doesn 't end up making things harder for you . Well , I appreciate your concern but that 's not why I called . I 've been thinking , and I was wondering if you ever thought about what it would have been like to have been my father ? That was never an option Jarod , so I never allowed myself to even entertain such a notion . Well thank you Sydney , for your honesty anyway .

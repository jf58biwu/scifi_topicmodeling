 Captain 's Log , Stardate 48532.4 . We 're on our way to a rogue planetoid which Mr. Neelix tells us is an extremely rich source of raw dilithium . If he 's right , this could go a long way toward easing our power shortage . Assuming we do find dilithium on this planetoid , we 're going to need a refining facility on the ship to process it . Lieutenant Torres has already asked permission to start modifications to the auxiliary impulse reactor . It could be converted into a crude dilithium refinery . The impulse reactor ? Sometimes I think B 'Elanna goes out of her way to find solutions that ignore Starfleet procedures . Her arguments are quite convincing . She thinks it can be done safely . I 'm sure it can . Tell her I want regular reports on her progress every step of the way . Are you sure you won 't join me for breakfast ? I was thinking of having eggs Benedict with asparagus , strawberries and cream ... I said I was thinking about it . I 'm actually having ration pack # 5- - stewed tomatoes with dehydrated eggs . Mmm , sounds delicious , but I 've already had my vacuum-packed oatmeal this morning . I 'll see you on the Bridge . Here you are . Hope you enjoy it . What is going on here ? Captain , you caught me by surprise . I could say the same thing . What are you doing ? I know how you and the other , uh , senior officers have been- - excuse me- - disappointed with the rations lately , so I thought I 'd use a few of the vegetables from the hydroponics bay and whip up a ... ooh , a little breakfast . You have turned this into a Galley ? It wasn 't easy . I had to completely reroute the Mess Hall power conduits and scrounge a lot of supplies from all over the ship , but that 's my specialty- - making something out of nothing . I know it doesn 't look like much now , but in a few days , you 'll swear there 'd been a Galley here for years . Careful . That one is a little spicy . Neelix ... who approved this ? Uh , well ... no one . Well , you might have asked me first . This used to be my private dining room . Your , your dining room ? If you had checked the ship 's directory , you 'd have noticed that Cabin 125-Alpha , Deck 2 , is designated as the Captain 's Private Dining Room . Oh ... oh , ah , then I guess that you 'll be wanting me to move all of this stuff out of your way ? Bridge to Captain Janeway . Go ahead . We 're approaching the rogue planetoid , Captain . On my way . I want you to come with me . We will deal with this later . Ensign Parsons , would you mind keeping an eye on things until I get back ... and , uh , rotate the darvot fritters every ten minutes until they turn a deep chartreuse . And remember- - one , one to a customer . What have you found ? We 're picking up definite dilithium signatures , Captain . The strongest readings are originating from ten to 20 kilometers inside the planetoid . It also looks like there 's a series of subterranean caves with an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere . Class-M . It 'll make mining a lot easier if we can go in there without environmental suits . How much dilithium are we talking about ? It 's hard to get a precise reading . It could be anywhere from 500 to ... 1,000 metric tons . Just as I said . I bet there are few Yallitian engineers who 'd give all three of their spinal columns to know where this planet is . Commander , take an away team down into those caves and do a preliminary geological analysis . Lieutenant , you 'd better get your dilithium refinery on line . It 'll be ready to go in three days . Ensign Kim . Where are you going ? With you . I 've been studying my Tricorder Operations Manual . Lieutenant Torres has brought me up-to-date on dilithium geophysics . I 've been preparing for this mission all week . Very well , Mr. Neelix . I think you 'll find me extremely helpful , Commander . I remember the first time that I flew past this planet . It was about three years ago ... Deck 4 . Looks like there are several large deposits in this general vicinity . Let 's split up and begin taking geological scans . Keep your com channels open at all times and don 't wander too far . Stay within a 50-meter radius of this position . Chakotay to Kim . Go ahead . I 'm still picking up dilithium signatures ... but there are no dilithium formations here . Have you found anything yet ? I 'm running a geo-stratal analysis of the rock in this vicinity . But so far , there 's no indication of any dilithium . Keep looking . Neelix to Commander Chakotay . Go ahead . I think I found something- - a large cavern approximately 20 meters from my position . I 'm reading a huge dilithium formation there . Don 't go any further , Neelix . Stay within the search radius . I 'll be with you in a minute . But it 's right here ! I 'm in the cavern now , Commander , but ... I don 't understand this . Let me guess- - nothing there ? Not so much as a sliver of dilithium . And yet , according to my readings , I should be surrounded by it . All right , I 've had enough of this . Kim , Neelix , we 're heading back to the ship . Rendezvous with the ... Wait a minute . I 'm getting unusual readings from this rock face . Traces of organic energy . Looks like a bioelectrical signature . I think there 's something alive down here . It 's about ... two meters into this rock face . Neelix , I said get back here . Neelix , did you hear what I said ? Just one minute , Commander . Hello ? Is there someone there ? Hello ? I know there 's somebody ... Neelix , what 's wrong ? Neelix ! Kim ! I 'm on my way , sir . I can 't be sure , but I think he 's going into shock . Chakotay to Voyager- - medical emergency . Beam us directly to Sick Bay . Get the blood-gas infuser . The what ? Equipment Storage Unit 2 , second shelf on the left , now . Hold him still . What 's happening , Doctor ? He 's going into a coma . The infuser will keep his oxygen level stable for the next hour or so , but after that , he 'll die . His lungs have been removed . By the time we got to him , he was unconscious . How could anyone remove his organs so quickly ? The doctor says whoever did this used some kind of transporter to beam the lungs directly out of his body . What happened ? It appears that Neelix was attacked . We don 't know how it happened , but someone has surgically removed his lungs . Did you find any evidence of the life sign that Neelix reported ? No . Captain , I 've analyzed the sensor logs from Neelix 's tricorder . The bio-scanner picked up a single class-3 humanoid organism . The blood-gas infuser will keep him alive for another 47 minutes . The only chance for his survival I see at the moment is to get his own lungs back . Can 't we fit him with a pair of artificial lungs ? His respiratory system is directly linked to multiple points along his spinal column . It 's too complex to replicate . I may be able to surgically reattach the organs if we get them back . In the meantime , I 'll have to search for other options . Commander , I 'm taking an away team back to the planet . You 're in charge until we return . lnform Mr. Tuvok I want three armed security detachments to accompany us . lssue type-3 phasers . Mr. Paris , did they teach you how to run a respiratory series in your biochemistry classes at the Academy ? No , I 'm afraid they didn 't . Fine . I 'll run it myself . Get me a pulmonary scanner . I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . I 'm not leaving . All right , just keep out of the way . Here it is . This is where Neelix was standing when he was attacked . According to his tricorder log , he was scanning this rock face when he detected the life sign . Neelix said there was a life sign two meters behind this wall , but my tricorder says there 's nothing but solid rock for another 15 meters . It sounds like our tricorders aren 't giving us the real picture behind what 's going on here . Wait a minute . The rock is warmer here . You 're right , Captain . There 's a two-degree differential in this section of the wall . There are no natural geological phenomena that could be creating this heat source . Let 's make a little heat of our own . There was a highly sophisticated force field in place . There 's a chamber down this corridor . Doc , I think his cellular toxicity level is rising . It 's up to 32 percent . Let 's see if we can stabilize those levels . Get me a cytoplasmic stimulator . Ah , we don 't have one . Then replicate one . Yeah . The design schematics are in the ship 's medical data base . Right . The man drives a 700,000-ton starship so somebody thinks he 'd make a good medic . I can survive with one lung , can 't I ? What if I donated a lung to Neelix ? Atransplant is not an option . No one aboard is a compatible match for a Talaxian . We 're going to need a completely new way to oxygenate his blood supply and relay neuro-electrical impulses . Our replicators can 't produce compatible artificial organs for him , but maybe there 's a way to mimic their functions and give us direct control of his respiratory system . Computer , is there an identification matrix on Mr. Neelix from the last time he used the transporter ? Affirmative . Transfer it to console 4 . What are you doing ? I 'm using the transporter matrix to get exact specifications for Neelix 's lungs . I thought you just said we can 't replicate his lungs . We can 't , but if I can reconfigure my emitter array , I might be able to create a pair of holographic lungs for Mr. Neelix . Holographic lungs ? If it 's successful , we can precisely control his pulmonary functions to allow normal breathing . But a hologram isjust a projection of light held in a magnetic containment field . There 's no real matter involved . Now ... you hit me . The magnetic containment field that creates the illusion of my body can be modulated to allow matter to pass through it or ... be stopped . I might be able to modulate the holographic lungs in the same way , allowing oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass from the lungs to the bloodstream . I want to know what this means . What are you going to do to him ? There 's no time to explain the exact procedure to you right now . Oh , well , make the time , because I 'm not going to let you perform any experimental surgery on Neelix until I know exactly what you 're doing and what the risks are . The risk is that it won 't work . And if it doesn 't , he 'll die . But it is his only immediate chance for survival . If he does survive , he 'll have to be held motionless in an isotropic restraint . The lungs need to be perfectly aligned to his internal physiology . The computer won 't be able to compensate for any body movement whatsoever . How long will he have to stay like that ? For the rest of his life , unless the holo-lungs can be replaced by his original organs , and he will never be able to leave the holographic environment of this room . The holo-lungs would disappear the moment he went out the door . Kes , I know it sounds pretty grim , but it 's better than losing him completely . This way , he 'll still be alive . And maybe we can find a better solution somewhere down the road . What do you think Neelix would want ? I 'm not sure . But I do know that I want him to live . This room is the source of the dilithium signature we detected earlier . The power systems here are running on an unusual dilithium matrix . So there are actually no dilithium deposits on this planet ? It would appear not . Are these organs ? This looks like some kind of storage facility . I would say you are correct , Captain . This appears to be a biological repository . Any sign of Neelix 's lungs ? Negative . There is , however , a Kazon liver , and although I cannot identify the other organs on display here , I would say they bear a striking similarity to pulmonary organs , epidermal tissue , ocular nerve fiber ... Save the cataloging for later , Tuvok . According to my tricorder , there was a life form in this room less than ten minutes ago . Captain . Open it . One life sign 20 meters ahead . Let 's go . They 've erected a force field with a rotating phase modulation . We will not be able to disrupt it . Voyagerto Captain Janeway . Go ahead . We 'vejust picked up an alien ship leaving the planet . Tractor them , Commander . Sorry , Captain . They went into warp too quickly . Beam us back . As soon as we 're aboard , lay in a course for pursuit , maximum warp . Aye , Captain . Okay ... the isotropic restraint is activated . He won 't be able to move more than two microns in any direction . One micron would be preferable , but I suppose it 'll have to do . lnitiating the holographic emitter array . His cellular toxicity is rising . 82 percent . 86 percent . Computer , activate program Neelix-1 . Deactivate the infuser . It 's off-line . Here we go . 90 percent . 95 percent . Toxicity returning to normal . Captain 's Log , supplemental . We are pursuing the alien ship from the moon . They are not responding to hails , and it appears that our two ships are evenly matched for speed . Holographic lungs ? Yes . And they 're working perfectly , if I do say so myself . Try to breathe normally . How long can I live like this ? I don 't know . This is an unprecedented medical procedure . We will be closely monitoring your condition . When do I get out of this restraint ? Unless Captain Janeway is successful in retrieving your original lungs , you 'll have to stay in the isotropic restraint indefinitely . lndefinitely ? You mean I ... I could be in here the rest of my life ? Yes . But we 're trying to find the aliens that did this to you . The Captain is doing everything she can . Well ... if I 'm going to be in here a while , now 's as good a time as any to tell you . Your ceiling is hideous . I didn 't design the room . I just work here . Something with a bit of color would help . Maybe a nice tapestry or a painting . Uh , could you dim the lights a little ? I 'm a doctor , Mr. Neelix , not a decorator . Perhaps you would be willing to accommodate his ... aesthetic needs . And some music would be nice . Or better yet , are you programmed to sing ? Janeway to Paris . Please report to the Bridge . I 'm on my way , Captain . You know where I am if you need me . Thanks for everything . Oh , fine . I have a little accident , I lose a pair of lungs , and the next thing I know Paris is swooping in like a Rectilian vulture . What are you talking about ? Didn 't you hear the way that he said that ? " I 'll be on the Bridge if you need me . " " lf you need me . " Neelix ... Why doesn 't hejust pull the plug on the holographic emitter , and get it over with , get me out of the way , so he can have you all to himself ? Neelix , you 're overreacting . Tom 's been very supportive . Ah , so it 's " Tom " now , is it ? You really have nothing to worry about . We 're friends , that 's all . It 's not you I 'm worried about . It 's him . He 'sjust ... one big hormone walking around the ship . Don 't you see the way that he looks at you ? This is ridiculous . I am not going to argue with you about something that exists only in your imagination . I know you , Neelix . And I know you 're afraid . I just want you to know that no matter what happens , I 'll be here with you . Ke ... Kes ... I could be in here a very long time . You need to go on with your life . Don 't worry about me . Neelix ... You should just let me die . Stop that . We 're going to get through this together . Visiting hours are over . He needs rest . When can I come back ? 1700 hours , not a minute before . I 'll see you then . Don 't worry . I 'm not going to kiss you . I 'm only adjusting the restraint . I 'll try to contain my disappointment . Captain , we 've completed our diagnostic on the alien device . It appears to be more than a weapon . It 's also a very sophisticated medical scanner and surgical instrument . From what we can tell , It uses a neural resonator to stun the victim while a quantum imaging scanner begins a microcellular analysis of the entire body . The amount of information this thing can gather puts a tricorder to shame . You fire this at someone , you learn everything about their anatomy , right down to their DNA sequencing . So it sounds like we 're dealing with aliens who 've developed a technology specifically designed to locate and extract organs from other beings . Why ? Captain . The alien ship has dropped out of warp . It 's approaching a large asteroid . On screen . It 's entered the asteroid , Captain . Hold position here . Mr. Kim ? I can 't scan the interior . The surface stratum is made up of some sort of neutronium alloy . It doesn 't look like a natural formation . Are you saying someone built this asteroid ? It 's possible . Any sign of weapons or defense systems ? Negative . I think I 've located where the alien ship entered . There 's an open crater on the limb of the asteroid . Let 's see it . The ion trail from the alien ship leads directly inside . How large is that crater ? 200 meters in diameter . Captain , may I suggest you consider carefully what you are about to do . How do you know what I 'm about to do ? I could describe to you in detail the psychological observations I 've made about you over the past four years , which lead me to conclude you 're about to take this ship inside the asteroid , but suffice it to say I know you quite well . One of these days , I 'm going to surprise you , Tuvok , but not today . I 've already considered other options . If Neelix has any chance of surviving , we have to act fast . Red Alert . Mr. Paris , lay in a course . Aye , Captain . Mr. Tuvok , maximum shields . Phasers at the ready . Captain , I 'm reducing power to the aft thrusters only . This passageway is getting a little too narrow for my taste . Use your discretion , Mr. Paris . Any sign of the vessel , Lieutenant ? We 're still following the ion trail , but electromagnetic interference is limiting our sensor range . I 'm only able to scan 500 meters ahead of us . Are there any indications we 're being scanned or probed , Mr. Kim ? Not yet . Doctor ? Doctor , I require your assistance . What is it , Mr. Neelix ? Please , it 's urgent . Yes ? I have an itch . An itch ? Just above my left eyebrow . A little higher . Oh , thank you . You 're quite welcome . Doctor , wait , don 't leave . I 'm not leaving , Mr. Neelix . I 'm simply going back to work . I can 't see you over there . I ... I feel like I 'm all alone . You are all alone . I 'm a holographic projection- - a projection with a lot of work to do , I might add . That 's very amusing , Doctor . But ... um ... I 'm really starting to feel a little , uh ... trapped in here . A little claustrophobic maybe . I 'm not sure what to do . There 's nothing you can do except lie there and be quiet . I 'm going to lie here for the rest of my life , aren 't I ? Just staring up at the ceiling . I 'm not sure I can take that . I really need to get out of this restraint . Doctor , I want you to let me out of this thing right now . You know that 's impossible . I 'm the patient . I know what my rights are . I want to be released from this restraint immediately . lmmediately ! Mr. Neelix , you are alive , you are breathing and for the moment , your condition is stable . That is more than most people can say in your situation . Now , it is critical to your recovery that you not subject yourself to any additional stress . Try to calm down . Don 't tell me to calm down ! You 're not the one trapped in a restraining field with holo-lungs . I don 't think they 're working . I can 't ... I can 't get enough oxygen . There 's something wrong . You 're hyperventilating . Try to take slow , natural breaths . I can 't . I 'm dying . Let me out of here . Will you help me ? Help me . Help me ! You 're doing just fine , Mr. Paris . Just fine . Thanks , Captain . Sensors detect a large chamber ahead . What the hell ? We appear to be seeing Voyager and the alien ship reflecting off the walls of the chamber . Can you determine which ship is the real one ? No , Captain . The walls are emanating severe electromagnetic interference . I cannot scan them directly . It 's like trying to move through a hall of mirrors . You never know when you 're going to walk into the glass . I 'm still picking up the alien 's ion trail . Maybe we should follow that . They might have left a fake ion trail to lure us in here . It could lead us right into one of those walls . That 's a chance we 're going to have to take . Tuvok , extend the deflectors to maximum range . If we do run into something , it 'll give us an extra margin of error . Follow the ion trail , Mr. Paris , slowly . Mr. Kim , continuous scans . Aye , Captain . I 'll do what I can to reassure him , Doctor . Good. lf you don 't mind , I 'd like you to remain in Sick Bay , so you 're here when he wakes up . Of course . Are you all right ? Me ? You seem agitated about something . Of course I 'm agitated . This entire situation is getting out of control . You mean Neelix . First they tell me there 's no doctor , so I have to be on call 24 hours a day . And then they tell me there are no nurses , so I have no one to assist me . I thought Tom Paris was assigned to you . Like I said , no one to assist me , and now I have a patient with severe and possibly long-term emotional problems and there 's no Counselor on board . I am an emergency medical supplement- - a supplement , that 's all . I wasn 't programmed for any of this . It 'sjust ... unacceptable . I don 't know anything about holographic engineering , but if you want my opinion , you haven 't been acceptable . You 've been remarkable . I 've only done what the program allows me to . Give yourself some credit . You saved his life . You did- - not some program . It may seem that way to you . That 's exactly how it seems . You 're very ... kind . How does a real doctor learn to deal with patients emotional problems , anyway ? They learn from experience . Aren 't you capable of learning ? I have the capacity to accumulate and process data , yes . Then I guess you 'll just have to learn ... like the rest of us . Have you ever considered a career in medicine ? Neelix is starting to regain consciousness . Lieutenant , I 'm picking up a minor power fluctuation in the warp core . Compensate with the KLS stabilizer . No effect . In fact , the power loss is starting to accelerate . Janeway to Torres . What 's going on down there ? Some kind of power drain . I can 't localize it , but ... we 're losing power at a rate of seven percent per minute . The power drain is coming from somewhere in this chamber , Captain . Some kind of dampening field . It 's bleeding energy directly from the warp nacelles . B 'Elanna , shut down the warp core . Go to emergency power . No effect , Captain . Keep me informed . Bridge out . Can you pinpoint the source of the dampening field ? It appears to be coming from 217 mark 015 . Distance 547 meters . Tuvok . What would happen if we locked phasers and fired at the source ? The walls of this chamber reflect directed energy . The phaser beam would ricochet along an unpredictable path , possibly impacting our ship in the process . All right . We won 't try that . Well , maybe we should . Tuvok , what would happen if we reduced the phaser power level to a minimum setting and sent out a continuous beam ? The phaser would continue to reflect off the bulkheads until it encountered a nonreflective material . Until it encountered a nonreflective material- - like the real alien ship . So we could use the phasers like a searchlight ... scan the interior of the station until we find the ship . Exactly . Do it . Adjusting phaser azimuth to 15 degrees . Wait a minute . I think I 've found the real ship . On screen . Mr. Paris , bring us within transporter range of that ship . Aye , Captain . I 'm picking up two life signs . They 're powering engines . Bridge to Transporter Room 3 . Lock on to those two life signs and beam them aboard . Security , meet me in Transporter Room 3 . Aye , sir . You 're on the Starship Voyager . I 'm Captain Kathryn Janeway of the United Federation of Planets . I am Dereth ... of the Vidiian Sodality . You attacked one of our crew members and you lured us into this asteroid . Why ? We are gathering replacement organs and suitable biomatter . It is the only way we have to fight the phage . A virus ? Some kind of disease ? Yes . It attacked our people over two millennia ago . It consumes our bodies destroys our genetic codes and cellular structures . So you harvest the bodies of other beings to replace your own tissues as they 're consumed by this ... phage ? Our immunotechnology cannot keep up . The phage adapts . It resists all attempts to destroy it . Our society has been ravaged . Thousands die each day . There is no other way for us to survive . I have a great ... sympathy for what your race has endured . But I cannot allow you to keep the organs you removed from one of our crew members . We need them back immediately . I 'm afraid that isn 't possible . I have already biochemically altered the air-breathing organs and grafted them into Motura 's body . They are a part of him now . He is my honatta . His task is to find the organs I need for survival . We ... we try to extract them from the dead ... But sometimes , when the need is immediate more aggressive actions are required . So now I am left with the same choice you made- - whether to commit murder to save a life , or to allow my own crewman to die while you breathe air through his lungs . It must be impossible for you to understand how any civilized people could come to ... this . Before the phage began , we were known as educators and explorers- - a people whose greatest achievements were artistic . I , myself , am a sculptor of note on my world . All I can say is that when your entire existence is at stake ... You don 't have to explain yourself , Motura . If the consequence of this act is a death sentence , so be it . At least it will put an end to my suffering . I can 't begin to understand what your people have gone through . They may have found a way to ignore the moral implications of what you 're doing , but I have no such luxury . I don 't have the freedom to kill you to save another . My culture finds that to be a reprehensible and entirely unacceptable act . If we were closer to home , I would lock you up and turn you over to my authorities for trial but I don 't even have that ability here , and I am not prepared to carry you forever in our brig . So I see no other alternative ... but to let you go . Take a message to your people . If I ever encounter your kind again , I will do whatever is necessary to protect my people from this ... harvesting of yours . Any aggressive actions against this ship or its crew will be met by the deadliest force . Is that clear ? Uh ... quite . Wait . I want to see this crewman of yours . That can serve no useful purpose . Maybe it can . Our medical technologies may be superior to theirs . I can tell you , from what we 've observed of them , that they are considerably superior . She spared my life- - our lives . We owe it to them to see if there 's anything we can do to help him . I 'll take you to him . His simulated organs are primitive . It 's amazing he is still alive . This is set to scan only . Proceed ... carefully . Strange . According to my readings , you are not here . Believe me , I wish I weren 't . The rest of you are healthy . You are compatible for organ transplant . Wait a minute . We 've already considered this . Talaxian physiology is different from that of anyone else on this ship . His immune system would reject their lungs immediately . Your surgical knowledge is inferior . We will simply adapt his immunogenicity . It won 't be a problem . Which of you will donate a lung ? Me . No ! Absolutely not . It 's too dangerous . Let someone else do it . No , I want to do it , Neelix . I 'm willing to take the risk . Besides , you 've done so much for me . Let me give you something once . Just for once . All right . I look forward to sampling your cooking , Mr. Neelix . You mean I can keep my kitchen ? Well , at least until we get the replicators back on line . Thank you , Captain . And , Captain ... I 'll see you at breakfast . Captain 's Log , supplemental . The aliens have successfully transplanted one of Kes 's lungs into Neelix . The dampening field has been deactivated , and I have allowed them to beam back to their vessel . We are resuming a course home . It 's all right . The operation was a success . Neelix is asleep and breathing on his own now ... with your lung . I feel a little light-headed . That will pass . You 'll soon adapt to diminished lung capacity . I spoke to the Captain about you . She 's given me permission to begin training you as a medical assistant . You 'll be a backup for Mr. Paris or , possibly , a replacement . That is , assuming you 're interested . Of course I 'm interested . When do we start ? We 'll begin your lessons as soon as you 've fully recovered . Thank you , Doctor . Thank you . You 've ... given me a lot to think about .

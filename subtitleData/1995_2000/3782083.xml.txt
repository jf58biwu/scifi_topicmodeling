 Crossbow ? Dino sized ... just the thing to ruin a raptors day . Roxton we 're losing daylight . Is this what you had in mind ? Straight enough for arrows . Start sharpening the ends into points . Fine I 'll do the survey by myself . Only a fool would go off by himself . Roxton we need to find a way off this plateau ... not be playing around with bows and arrows . There 's only one way off this plateau Challenger , alive . What was that ? Hey you ugly son of a bitch over here . Nice kitty . Come on it 's me you want . This 'll do me . At the dawn of the century A band of adventures set out to prove the impossible The existence of a prehistoric world The Visionary The Heiress The Hunter The Scientist and The Reporter All chasing the story of a lifetime Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive In this amazing world of lost civilizations and terrifying creatures Always searching for a way home A way out of ... the Lost World Look what I found . He 's alright . But where the hell is he ? Does anybody else feel that ? Somebody 's on their way back for the main course . It 's a whirlpool ! Where are the women ? Challenger ! Swim for the edges ! Are you all right ? Take it easy Summerlee . Oh my , that was rather invigorating . Good are we all here . Except for Roxton . Like a bad penny . I 'll take it over a T-Rex . Tracks ... animal tracks here in the sand . Hoof prints from a horse ... look there wheel tracks . A horse drawn carriage here ? Must be some sort of civilization near by . So let 's follow the tracks they 've got to lead somewhere . Somewhere with food and dry clothes . There 's less than an hour of daylight left ... and we 've got one knife between us . She 's right ... let 's keep the water at our back and build a fire . We 'll strike out at first light . What the hell ? It 's a thigh bone ... femur if I 'm not mistaken . It 's human . It 's going to be dark soon let 's get that fire going . Do you think your editor will believe any of this ? I just hope he gets a chance to read it . So Roxton just curious ... why did you risk your life for me with that dinosaur ? Umm Must have thought you were someone else . What can you see ? My father ... the day he taught me to swim . Your parents have been gone a long time . Eleven years . I will find them . What if we were to find a way off this plateau would you leave ? Oh yes . I 'm beginning to see how this place could grow on one . Run they 're coming ! Run ! Split up ! Run ! Good Lord , his larynx is crushed poor devil . Can you understand me ? Easy , easy don 't strain your breathing . How long have we been traveling ? Judging by the heat of the sun it 's midday . Ten or twelve hours can 't be . Did anyone have a good look at our captors ? No but they 're obviously intelligent . They have tools , they have the wheel ... sort of . And domesticated animals . Quiet , I think we 're slowing . Keep moving , human Release them ! Quite a catch . We mean you and your people no harm . Guards seize him ! Tribune here he is . This is the one who lead the escape . Human ... what would you do in the world on your own ? Run rampant like a savage ... until you starved ... or perished in the belly of a beast ? Here you had purpose ... your life had meaning . But now ... kill him . First lesson human ... defiance will not be tolerated . Tribune ? He 's strong he will be useful . This one he is too old to work in the mines . No wait ! Please he 's harmless . Oh for Pete sake . Tribune , you look like a reasonable man . Trust me ... he 'll be more valuable to you alive ... we all will . Noru ? Put the men in the cells including the old one . Guards to the cell ! Tribune ... what about the women ? I have something more interesting in mind for them . Lizard men what the hell are those things . They 're our masters ... descended from the noblest of all beasts ... the dinosaurs . I 'm Solomon , are you from the empire ? Professor Summerlee and if you mean the British Empire you 're entirely correct British ? He doesn 't . We 're strangers I 'm Challenger ... this is Roxton and Malone . Those creatures you call them masters ? They rule and we serve . Slaves ? It is the way . Your way , not ours . It 's our only food for today . There 's got to be a way out of here . Not unless you 're a champion of the pit like me . The pit ? A battle between two men ... to the death . Three more kills I 'll be free . Hey . Don 't bruise the merchandise . What is this ? Looks like our ticket out of this place . If that lizard man ! Tribune If he thinks I 'm going to put this on he 's crazy . Look ... the Tribune may be half lizard but he 's also half man . Near as I can work it there are two ways out of here : alive or dinner . Solomon your saying you kill people , men ... for sport . No not sport , to survive . The winners are granted life ... so they can fight again . And what happens to the losers ? You 're eating them . For the champion ... and the new challenger . Challenger ? Tomorrow ... when the sun reaches it 's zenith ... the warriors will do battle ... to the death . to the death . There that 's better . Better than what . Being dead Here comes the competition . I 've never seen you before are you from a nearby village ? - We 're from ... - Yeah you could say that . Quickly . I 've been thinking about you . I detest spies . Spies ? Unless they 're on a spit roasting slowly . Look we 're here by mistake . Silence ! You were sent by the empire ... clever of my political enemies to use human spies this time . We weren 't sent by anyone . The names ... Cassius ... and Melchior ... they mean nothing to you ? No . I swear . Do you know what they mean to me ? Two years ... in this blasted ... waist land . Perhaps I shouldn 't kill you . Perhaps I should send you back with a message for them . You may tell them ... that I will return to the Empire and when I do it will be as their ruler as their emperor . Tribune ... personally I 'm in favor of a little ambition . Human ... the only reason you 're still alive ... is that you may please the warriors . And who I wonder ... pleases you ? If I didn 't know better ... I 'd swear your blood was as cold as mine . Interesting . I say Malone are you feeling perfectly well ? I 'll tell you in a minute . How illuminating . A little trick I picked up in New York . Nothing like the education of a life well spent that 's what I always say . Well actually the trick is professor not getting caught . Just as I thought , sulfur . Oh fascinating Challenger absolutely fascinating what a relief ... it is to know the geological composition of our prison walls . Sulfur , Charcoal ... has basic chemistry failed the all knowing Summerlee . What is he talking about ? Gunpowder ? Exactly and our ticket out of here . Yes but aren 't you forgetting the Potassium Nitrate ? What did we walk through on the way to this cell ? A field . And what were the slaves doing in that field ? Fertilizing it . Saltpeter . Your shoes man take them off scrape them very carefully ... we need every last speck . You really think it will work ? It 's our only chance . Now hurry up with this lock . God knows what unspeakable things they 're doing to Roxton . No I can 't take anymore . Best eat your fill it 's probably your last . We don 't have to fight each other . The masters have ordered it . There is no choice . Of course you have a choice you 're a man dammit not an animal . Solomon listen to me ... you 're obviously a great warrior . What would happen if you use your skills against the creatures ? No slave can openly defy the empire ... it is impossible . How do you know ? Because it 's never been done . That my friend is very different then impossible . Quiet ... don 't speak of this again . What now ? Now we choose . Champion goes first . You ! Now your turn . If you please . Cynara your warrior is a good man . Treat him well . You two know each other ? She 's my sister . I see how your soldiers respect you . Your talents are wasted here . You 're stating the obvious , my dear . Baby sitting a bunch of humans in the boondocks . A man ... reptile ... of your stature and intelligence ... should clearly be ruling the empire . Unfortunately ... my grotesque little minx . The magistrates do not agree . They see one such as myself ... leader of vision and power ... and they quake . What if I ... could deliver the Empire to you ? You 're human ... your uses are breading and mining ... and the occasional hors d 'oeuvre . I can offer you something that will bring your opponents to their knees . What could you possibly have ... that would be of use to me ? Technology , I come from a world full of wonders . With me at your side Tribune ... entire continents will lay themselves at your feet . The whole Empire will be at your mercy . The forces of my world : The politics , soldiers , slaves . What you speak of ... is magic ... superstition . Not magic science . Crude but hopefully effective . Feels like one deadbolt on the other side . Quickly . We only get one chance at this . Hurry up . Thats enough , step back quickly ! Success Let 's get out of here . What 's it this ? Not exactly the Marquise of Queensbury old boy but well done . You see Tribune I told you there were wonders in my world . What are you doing ? It 's time we began . Oh , no it 's not . You 're here for my pleasure . Let me know when you 've had enough pleasure . Thank you . And now ... how can I serve you ? what are you doing ? You chose me didn 't you ? Yes but not ... there that 's better . Better ? You think I 'm ugly . Ugly ? No I wouldn 't say that . Enough ! I could kill you right now . But then you 'd never find a way out . A way out ? An escape . We 're human ... there is no escape . Escape ? You 're crazy . Any slave who runs is hunted down killed . Nothing is worth dying for . Not even your freedom ? What freedom is there in death ? At least now I 'm alive . Cynara this isn 't living . If you could choose freedom would you ? Yes . Good I 'll need your help . I 'm not a warrior like Solomon what can I do ? You can scream . You refuse to tell me the secret of this . Come on Challenger . You 're not going to let a little gunpowder stand between us and the highway . Well if you don 't value your life . Perhaps your friends will . Quiet . That goes for you too Summerlee . I refuse to stand by while you ... You must . We can 't allow gunpowder to fall in the hands of this tyrant imagine what it will do to the balance of power in his world . You 're quite sure of old boy . You senile charlatan , this is your chance to finally be rid of me . As you wish . Compassion ... and sacrifice ... such nobility in a lower species . Might almost be touching if it wasn 't so pathetic ... but nobility can be a two edged sword . I seem to be losing my touch . What do you say now ? Is this creature to be your friend or my dinner ? What 's going on seize them ! Solomon how 's about giving me a hand ? Human ... you breathe and you die . Your friend won 't get far . Get these humans out of my site . Excellent . I just may keep you alive after all ... What is this ? This slave ... murdered a centurion of the Empire . The female has escaped . I should have known better then to consort with the lower species . Did anyone ever tell you you 've got lousy timing . Take this one to the mines the rest of them to the pit . Take them away ! See how they smell the stench of death already . Fight with me not against me . Don 't worry I 'll try to cut clean . You 're a pal . There now hey . Back to work , keep working . This woman is suffering from heat exhaustion . Back to work . Halt ! Food for the miners Tribune 's orders . I smell meat . Let the games begin . I 'm not going to fight you . Fight me ! No Fight human ! You may choose whether I live or die but only I choose whether I kill . Die and your friends die ... win and they live . Tell them to tie them a little tighter so the gunpowder doesn 't leak out . This is the last batch . Good it 's time to give Tribune and his men a little lesson in human ingenuity . No You must . We 're not animals . Solomon , choose . Freedom . Roxton ! Roxton are you all right ? Nothing that a good whiskey won 't cure . I must say I never thought we 'd all make it through alive . I hope you know that was my plan all along . Science . The empire is mine . Freedom it still sounds strange on my tongue . You 'll get used to it . It would be easier if I had someone with me . You have a whole colony . I meant someone like you . Goodbye Solomon . No you 've got it turned around , that 's the direction . Once again you 're delusional . There 's an ancient Chinese curse that says 'May you live in interesting times ' . Really know what I say ? What ? First rounds on me .

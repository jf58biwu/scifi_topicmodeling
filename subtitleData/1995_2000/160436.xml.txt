" SEVERAL YEARS AGO , I HAD AN EXPERIENCE I COULD NOT EXPLAIN . " I WAS LYING IN MY BED WHEN I FELT A PRESENCE IN THE ROOM . " THOUGH I WAS AWAKE , I FELT SOMETHING HAD TAKEN CONTROL OVER MY BODY . " I DON 'T REMEMBER MUCH ELSE , BUT I WOKE UP THREE DAYS LATER PREGNANT WITH MY SON , IZZY . " THAT WAS 18 YEARS AGO , BUT NOW IT HAPPENED AGAIN . " I WAS IN BED AND COULD SWEAR I HEARD CHER SINGING , " THE ONE WHO WAS MARRIED TO SONNY . " THEN THE ROOM GOT ALL SMOKY ... " AND I SAW SOME KIND OF MONSTER . " HE HAD A REALLY GROSS FACE WITH LUMPS ALL OVER HIS HEAD . " I WAS TOO SCARED TO SCREAM . " THEN I GOT ALL GROGGY AND CONKED OUT FOR THREE DAYS . " GUESS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I WOKE UP ? " I GOT YOUR NAME OFF THE TV . " SOME LADY ONTHE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW , WHO HAD A WEREWOLF BABY , " SAID YOU CAME TO HER HOUSE . " WELL , I GOT HER STORY BEAT BY A MILE . SO MAYBE YOU 'LL WANT TO COME SEE ME TOO . SINCERELY , SHAINEH BERKOWITZ . " SCULLY , DO YOU THINK IT 'S TOO SOON TO GET MY OWN 1-900 NUMBER ? SO , DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE THAT WEREWOLF BABY OR WAS THAT JUST A STORY ? NO , IT HAD SOMETHING CALLED HYPERTRICHOSIS LANUGINOSA . IT 'S A RARE HEREDITARY CONDITION MOST COMMONLY FOUND IN SOME SOUTH AMERICAN FAMILIES . UH-HUH . BUT HE WAS ALL HAIRY AND STUFF ? UH , MRS. BERKOWITZ , YOU SAID THAT YOU ALSO HAD A SON ? MM-HMM . IZZY . THAT 'S HIM THERE . [ Scully ] AND IZZY IS THE PRODUCT ... OF YOUR UNION WITH SOME KIND OF INTRUDER ? I DON 'T KNOW ABOUT NO UNION , BUT I WOKE UP IN A CONDITION . - DID YOU REPORT THIS TO THE POLICE ? - OF COURSE I DID . [ Scully ] WAS THERE AN INVESTIGATION ? NOT REALLY . NOBODY HERE EVER LOCKS THEIR DOORS . AND IT TOOK ME A MONTH OR TWO TO FIGURE OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT . NOW YOU 'RE PREGNANT AGAIN ? [ Shaineh ] UH-HUH . BUT AS I TOLD AGENT MULDER ON THE PHONE , THAT 'S WHAT TAKES THE CAKE . MRS. BERKOWITZ HAD A TUBAL LIGATION TWO YEARS AGO . YOU CAN 'T PLANT A SEED IN A BARREN FIELD . THEY WERE COOKING SOMETHING ON THE RANGE . TOOK ME TWO DAYS OF SCRUBBING TO CLEAN THE SKILLET . I DON 'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM THERE WERE . I ONLY SAW THE ONE , BUT THEY ATE ALMOST A WHOLE DAMN JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER . YOU SAID YOU WERE GONE FOR THREE DAYS , BUT NOBODY MISSED YOU . - I KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE THINKIN ' . - DO YOU DRINK , MRS. BERKOWITZ ? NO , BUT I 'M NOT SO SURE MY INTRUDERS , AS YOU CALL THEM , DIDN 'T HAVE A FEW . SOMEBODY SET A TUMBLER HERE AND DIDN 'T USE NO COASTER . HMM . THAT 'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM TOO . IS THERE NO CHANCE THAT YOUR SON COULD HAVE PUT IT THERE ? IZZY 'S GOT MORE BRAINS THAN THAT . NOT MUCH MORE , BUT HE VALUES HIS LIFE . THAT PIGSTY THERE IS HIS ROOM . YOU KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS , DON 'T YOU , AGENT MULDER ? WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ? 'CAUSE YOU 'RE ALL QUIET AND STUFF . AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING YOU 'RE NOT SAYING ABOUT ALIEN ABDUCTIONS . THEY SAID ONJERRY SPRINGER YOU 'RE LIKE AN EXPERT . I DON 'T THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH ALIEN ABDUCTIONS . I DON 'T EVEN KNOW IF I BELIEVE IN THAT ANYMORE . OH , COME ON . REALLY ? [ Scully ] MRS. BERKOWITZ ? YOU GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE INTRUDER . YOU SAID HE HAD A GROSS FACE AND LUMPS ON HIS HEAD ? AND TWO MOUTHS . I DON 'T KNOW IF I MENTIONED THAT . FUNNY . SOUNDS JUST LIKE THIS . [ Shaineh ] OH , THAT . THAT 'S " THE GREAT MUTATO . " THAT 'S THE COMIC BOOK CHARACTER MY KID , IZZY , CREATED . [ Door Opening ] WHAT 'S GOING ON ? THESE ARE AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY FROM THE F.B.I. THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION ? WE WERE WONDERING ... HOW THIS SUSPECT IN YOUR MOTHER 'S CASE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THIS ? THE GREAT MUTATO . BECAUSE I 'VE SEEN HIM TOO . YOU 'VE SEEN THE GREAT MUTATO ? YEAH . A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND HERE HAVE . HAS IT CROSSED NEITHER OF YOUR MINDS WHAT YOU SAY YOU SAW THAT NIGHT ... FITS PERFECTLY WITH THIS CREATURE THAT YOUR SON CREATED ? YEAH , BUT ... THAT DON 'T MEAN IT DIDN 'T HAPPEN . DON 'T ASK ME WHY , BUT IT WORKS . PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICHES ? YOU THINK BOLOGNA WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE ? WHY ARE YOU HUMORING THEM , MULDER ? I 'M NOT HUMORING THEM . THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS CRIME . SO IS PERJURY . SO IS CALLING OUT F.B.I. AGENTS UNDER FALSE PRETENSES . FOR THE PURPOSE OF WHAT ? ISN 'T IT OBVIOUS ? I THINK WHAT WE 'RE SEEING HERE IS AN EXAMPLE ... OF A CULTURE FOR WHOM DAYTIME TALK SHOWS AND TABLOID HEADLINES ... HAVE BECOME A REALITY AGAINST WHICH THEY MEASURE THEIR LIVES . A CULTURE SO OBSESSED BY THE MEDIA AND A CHANCE FOR SELF-DRAMATIZATION ... THAT THEY 'LL DO ANYTHING TO GAIN A SPOTLIGHT . I AM ALARMED THAT YOU WOULD REDUCE THESE PEOPLE TO A CULTURAL STEREOTYPE . NOT EVERYBODY 'S DREAM IS TO GET ONJERRY SPRINGER . PSYCHOLOGISTS OFTEN SPEAK OF THE DENIAL ... OF AN UNTHINKABLE EVIL OR A MISPLACEMENT OF SHARED FEARS , ANXIETIES TAKING THE FORM OF A HIDEOUS MONSTER ... FOR WHOM THE MOST HORRIFIC HUMAN ATTRIBUTES CAN BE ASCRIBED . WHAT WE CAN 'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE OURSELVES CAPABLE OF ... WE CAN BLAME ON THE OGRE , ON THE HUNCHBACK , ON THE LOWLY HALF-BREED . [ Coughs ] COMMON SENSE ALONE WILL TELL YOU THAT THESE LEGENDS , THESE UNVERIFIED RUMORS , ARE RIDICULOUS . BUT , NONETHELESS , UNVERIFIABLE , AND , THEREFORE , TRUE IN THE SENSE THAT THEY 'RE BELIEVED TO BE TRUE . IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU DON 'T BELIEVE IN , MULDER ? [ Moaning ] SHH .

TURN THAT DAMN THING OFF ! - YOU 'RE ON MY PROPERTY ! - WE 'RE WITH THE F.B.I. - THEY 'RE NOT ! - WE WERE- - WE WERE CHASING WHAT THEY TOLD US WAS A MONSTER . MONSTER ? WHAT 'D I TELL YOU BOYS ? THERE AIN 'T NO MONSTER . I 'LL SHOW YOU THE MONSTER YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR . - WHO SENT YOU HERE ? - YOUR FATHER . MY FATHER IS A SIMPLETON FARMER . HE UNDERSTANDS NOTHING OF MY SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS . WHAT ACHIEVEMENTS ARE THOSE ? WHAT MAKES YOU THING YOU 'D UNDERSTAND THEM ANY BETTER ? WELL , I 'M A SCIENTIST , FOR ONE . THEN YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT ONCE IN A GENERATION , PERHAPS ONCE IN A LIFETIME , A TRUTH IS UNCOVERED ... WHICH THRUSTS MANKIND INTO A SHOCKING NEW CONSCIOUSNESS , TURNING ACCEPTED NOTIONS OF OUR VERY EXISTENCE ON THEIR HEAD . CONSIDER RELATIVITY , DOUBLE HELIX . AND NOW THE HOMEOTIC HOX GENE , FOR WHICH I WILL UNDOUBTEDLY ... HAVE MY PLACE AMONG THE COLUMBUSES OF SCIENCE AS A VISIONARY LEADER OF MEN . - YES ? - WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THESE , DR. POLLIDORI ? NEVER MIND . WHAT IS THE HOMEOTIC HOX GENE ? SHE 'S A SCIENTIST . ASK HER . I , UH , I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH , UM ... GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT . IF YOU TWO WILL EXCUSE ME , I REALLY DON 'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS . I HAVE TO TRAVEL TONIGHT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF EGOSTAT ... TO DELIVER AN INTERNATIONAL ADDRESS .

WHENDROSOPHILA WAS FIRST BORN . NOTICE THE ELEGANT SYMMETRY WITH WHICH THE PUPAE GROWS ... INTO A SERIES OF BEAUTIFUL SEGMENTS . [ Thunderclap ] WHAT WE HAVE FOUND- - WHAT I HAVE FOUND ... IS THAT THESE SEGMENTS REPRESENT A LINEAR MODEL ... FOR THE GENETIC DEVELOPMENT OF OUR FRIEND THE FLY . EACH GENE IS RESPONSIBLE ... FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS CORRESPONDING SEGMENT . THE LEGS , THE MOUTH , THE BODY , POSTERIOR AND ANTERIOR . BUT WHICH I , THROUGH MY GENIUS , CAN ALTER INTO A CREATION OF MY OWN . BEHOLD ... PROBOSCOPEDIA . THIS FLY HAS LEGS- - GROWING OUT OF HIS MOUTH . WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ? BECAUSE I CAN . [ Thunderclap ] COULD THAT BE DONE IN HUMANS ? THAT WOULD GO AGAINST EVERY SCIENTIFIC CONVENTION . BUT COULD IT BE DONE ? THEORETICALLY . [ Thunderclap ] GOOD NIGHT , DR. FRANKENSTEIN . DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK , MULDER , MUTATIONS LIKE THESE ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE ON HUMANS . THAT 'S NOT WHAT I JUST HEARD . EVEN IF THEY COULD , NO SCIENTIST WOULD EVEN DARE ... TO PERFORM THOSE KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS ON A HUMAN . THEN WHY DO THEM AT ALL ? TO UNLOCK THE MYSTERIES OF GENETICS . TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT , EVEN THOUGH WE SHARE THE SAME GENES , WE DEVELOP ARMS INSTEAD OF WINGS ; WE BECOME HUMANS INSTEAD OF FLIES OR MONSTERS . BUT , GIVEN THE POWER , WHO COULD RESIST ... THE TEMPTATION TO CREATE LIFE IN HIS OWN IMAGE ? WE ALREADY HAVE THAT ABILITY . IT 'S CALLED PROCREATION . AND FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING , I 'M GONNA VERIFY THE PREGNANCY OF SHAINEH BERKOWITZ . WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME AGAIN ? HUH ? WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME AGAIN ?

DESPITE MY APPEARANCE , WHICH YOU SEE IS QUITE HORRIBLE TO THE HUMAN SENSES , I HAVE NEVER ACTED TO HARM ANOTHER SOUL . - THESE ARE FIENDISH LIES ! - QUIET . TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO , MY FATHER , HAVING ONLY ONE SON- - A SPITEFUL , HATEFUL MAN OF SCIENCE ...

[ Crowd Gasps ] A SIMPLE MAN , HE RESCUED ME AND LOVED ME ... IN SPITE OF MY DEFORMITY . BUT AS TIME PASSED , I GREW RESTLESS FOR FRIENDS OF MY OWN . BECAUSE I COULDN 'T GO TO SCHOOL OR PLAY SPORTS ... OR EVEN SHOW MY FACE OUTSIDE THIS FARM , MY FATHER SET OUT TO LEARN HIS SON 'S SCIENCE ... SO THAT BEFORE HE DIED HE MIGHT CREATE FOR ME A MATE . UH-OH . ALAS , MY FATHER WAS A SIMPLE MAN ; HIS HEART CLOSE TO THE SOIL HE WORKED , THE ANIMALS HE TENDED . THE EXPERIMENTS HE ATTEMPTED , TOO ADVANCED ; THE SCIENCE TOO COMPLEX FOR HIS UNDERSTANDING . THE RESULTS OF HIS EXPERIMENTS UNSATISFACTORY .

 THE INNOCENT BODY ( DESERT SKY ) Perception of the present expectation of the future memory of the past . I don 't know . Try . I don 't know . Knife . Not exactly ... You prune branches off trees with this . How do we call it ? Prune branches off trees ... I don 't remember . Oh sleep , you who carries babies away I gave it to you only a baby bring it back a grown up child ... Aggeliki ? - My brother 's forgotten me . - He 'll be here , don 't you worry . WARDROBE You 're floating carefree within the embrace of the sea while poor me , I 'm too old a guard in this place ... Month after month , for too long consumed by the fire of Time with no other hope but this to be swallowed by that invisible and dreary Hades ... I have no other place to go to ... You are my motherland . You , whose sword has wiped her out . Both father and mother are dead . What will I have if I lose you ? Which homeland ? How shall I live ? You are my life and death . Excuse me . May I ? I come here visiting my sister . Yes , I know . You work at night all alone . What is this you 're looking at ? Damaged brain tissues . Traumatic memory losses . May I look too ? It looks like a labyrinth . Are we that complex ? It 's tissue from the frontal cerebral cortex . The region of all higher functions . Consciousness , thought ... And you can manage in all this chaos ? There 's order in this chaos . There 's billions of neural cells carrying electrochemical messages to one another that is images , meanings , sensations even a touch . These messages leave some sort of trace so we can recall them . This is memory . Memory ... And is memory necessary ? Wouldn 't it be better if we forgot ? Without memory we 're nothing . We are the things we have lived . So the things that torture us have to linger on too ? The things that torture us leave a deeper trace . Therefore we cannot get away . Perhaps those over there are to blame ? I have to go back to my sister . Water . Glass . Mouth . Eyes . SHIRT SCARF COAT TROUSERS Did it rain at night ? I heard rain . It won 't rain , I know . There is ... something ... Something 's wrong ... You don 't believe me ? I believe you , don 't worry . I 'm thirsty . My plants have withered . I 've gotten ill , too . And my brother , where is he ? You know ... I remember you . Your name is ... - Foteini . You ... know ! Why is he so afraid ? We 're not supposed to meet today . Shall I accompany you ? We can walk together for a while . Shoot him ! Aias ! My names which means groan , is now truly mine in all this misfortune . Death , oh Death ! Take me now ! Hurry ! I 'll tell you the rest down there . My lifestory ! Down there I 'll tell it you . In Hades ! I must find a way to show father that he didn 't bring a coward to life . How shameful wanting to hang on to life when you cannot change your destiny . Death , oh Death ! Take me now ! Hurry ! I 'll tell you the rest down there . My lifestory , I 'll tell it to you in Hades . Oh sleep , you who carries babies away I gave it to you only a baby bring it back a grown up child ... Why did you come here ? It is not allowed . Can I stay for a little ? Just a little ... You must go back . Go back ? Where ? I 'm old , dried up . So much has happened ... All my plants have withered . I had no more water to give them . I took them out of their pots , I held them in my hands ... Also my brother was out ... I sat on the stairs and waited for him . All my plants died on me in my arms . That 's past . It 's over now . I had a dream . We were walking , my brother and I ... He was leading ... I was following him ... We got to the river . We sat on our own rock , we put our feet in the water . Suddenly I noticed his hair in the sunlight . It had started to whiten . I reached out to touch him and that touch that one ... I MUST REMEMBER TO GET WATER Man . A man . Which one ? Unknown . Why unknown ? Because ... Because you don 't concentrate . Who is he ? Since you didn 't find it , never mind , it 's no one . I 'm tired . - Then I should go ? - No ... No . Let 's try again . I can 't . You can 't ? How about now ? A woman . On her own . It is me ! Relentless infinite Time ! It uncovers the hidden and hides the unhidden . Nothing is beyond expectation : Even unyielding will is defeated . The strongest oath , too . There ... Look at me ... Me that hardship has hardened like fire does to steel I now feel my mouth speak with a woman 's sweetness . For the sake of this here woman . Everything bends and succumbs . Winter 's most bitter blizzards must give way to the fruit-bearing Summer ... and the frightening circle of the night must move away as Day brings in the blazing light . and the fury of spinning winds is brought to sleep in the Sea 's embrace ... How can we not know of Humility ? I shall wash myself on a deserted shore be cleansed of the blood and appease the wild rage of the Godess ... In untrodden soil I shall bury the vile sword deep so that no soul knows of it . You found me . How 's my sister ? Why don 't you come ? She asks for you all the time . I do come . When she 's asleep . Why don 't you come and see her ? When I saw you on her bedside ... I liked the way you took care of her . Sometimes I find myself horribly wishing that this would end . Only when I 'm by her side I think of nothing . Look at me . Look at me . Let 's leave this place . And go where ? I live here . My home is where I used to live with my sister . I never go there . I want you to take me there . Say that again . I want you to take me there , this one ? This one . Again . I want you to take me there . I can 't . I 'm not an actress . That 's the idea . Say it . I want you to take me there . All right ? Again . I like it . I want you to take me there . I want you to take me there . I want you to take me there . One day mother started seeing and listening to things we could not . She had quitted the theatre . That morning there was a storm . My sister and I crawled under their sheets in fear . Father started telling stories about Zeus and his thunders . Mother 's feet were icy cold . The storm stopped . Mother gets up without a word she dresses leisurely ... I feel my sister 's hand in mine . Small and sweaty . Mother goes to the window . She draws the curtains . A cold light comes into the room . She 's standing still . She closes her eyes . Can 't you hear that thing swirling nonstop ? , she says . Father became silent . We couldn 't hear a thing . I found her lying here . Clasping her plants in her arms . I 'm cold . A penny for your thoughts . What 's happening in here right now ? Do you know ? No . I want you . I want to be near you . Go . You 're late . She must have waken up by now . I 'll be there , too . Come . I will come later . Leave , then . I want you near me all the time . I need you . That night you didn 't come , a dog was shot . I have the howling in my ears . I started to run ... I fell ... Will you be with me ? Say yes . Don 't answer . Why standest thou afar off , O Lord ? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble ? Unto thee , O Lord , do I lift up my soul . For in thee do I trust . Forget not the humble . My heart within me is desolate . I remember the days of old . I meditate on all thy works ; I muse on the work of thy hands . I stretch forth my hands unto thee . My soul thirsteth after thee , as a thirsty land . Whatsoever the Lord pleased , that did he in heaven , and in earth in the seas , and all deep places ... He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth ... He bringeth the wind out and maketh lightnings for the rain ... The earth is the Lord 's and the fulness thereof ... Hear my prayer , O Lord give ear to my supplications ... My soul thirsteth after thee , as a thirsty land . I 'm a burden . I know . Don 't wait . He 's not coming . What 's your guilt , you poor innocent body ? WITH LOVE TO MOM AGGELIKI Don 't do this to me ... Don 't do this to me . Talk to me . I can 't bear this , I 'm scared ... Open up ! Say something . Talk to me . I 'm scared . I have no other place to go to ... You are my motherland . You whose sword has wiped her out . Both father and mother are dead , in Hades . What will I have if I lose you ? Which homeland ? How shall I live ? You are my life and death . You are my suitor . In memory ... .. you shall keep the joys you had from me ... Life is sweet only before one knows what joy and sorrow mean . Until then , my son feed on clear , fresh air strengthen your soul and be your mother 's joy . Have I been here long ? Just sleep . Is there light outside ? It 's night . Sleep . What 's this sound ? The wind . It 's still windy . Foteini ... What ? Get plenty of sleep . SHOES Expired . Its torment is over . Barbarism . Nothing has changed . Don 't be fooled by all these . You don 't remember me but I remember you . A very bashful child . I treated your mother in ward 2 . It 's become a wardrobe room . Then I came upstairs to the labs . I believed in it ! In whatever may soothe pain . Is our pain more important than its pain ? We 've placed ourselves in the centre of the world , my dear friend . In exile . This exile we named " civilization " . To not be in pain . To not feel . And finally to not have any memory . I saw your mother on the stage many years ago . Before you were born . She looked a lot like your sister . Go to her , she 's waiting for you . Everything is ruled by thunder , my dear friend . When it finally rains listen to what the thunder will say . Sleep some more . - I 'm better . - No , you must stay some more ! You can go if you want to . What is this ? I found it . What is it ? Have you always lived here ? I don 't know . You don 't want to remember . I don 't know . There , you see ? Not even your name . You give me one . Me ? My father 's name . Let me get some , too . Shall we go to the river again ? Yes . Now come on , get ready . Is it cold outside ? Yes . Put on something warm . It 's going to rain . I hope so . Now , put on your coat . I won 't manage ... We 'll be together . It 'll be fine , little sister . 2 ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... 6 ... 7 ... 8 ... 9 ... They 're still here . - 11 - 11 ... 12 ... - 13 ... - 13 ... 14 ... 15 ... Hear how she 's grown ? - 19 ... - 19 ... - 20 ! - 20 ... 21 ... Needs painting . We 'll change the curtains , too . ( Children 's song ) Oh sleep , you who carry babies away I gave it to you only a baby bring it back a grown up child grown up like a high mountain ... I won 't come there again . I love you .

 I REVIEWED YOUR CASE AND YOUR SERVICE RECORD - COMBAT DUTY IN PANAMA , GRENADA , DISTINGUISHED SERVICE IN THE GULF , GREAT TRIUMPHS AND GREAT TRAGEDIES . IT 'S CLEAR TO ME , LIEUTENANT COLONEL , THAT THESE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS OF YOURS ARE SIMPLY JUST - CRIES FOR HELP . YOU 'VE TRIED AND FAILED TO KILL YOURSELF THREE TIMES IN AS MANY WEEKS . FRANKLY , IF YOU WANTED TO - YOU DON 'T UNDERSTAND . HE WON 'T LET ME . HE WON 'T LET ME DIE . WHO ? WHO WON 'T LET YOU DIE ? JUST RELAX A MOMENT . I 'LL BE BACK WITH SOMETHING TO HELP YOU SLEEP . STAND DOWN , LIEUTENANT COLONEL . NO ! NOT THIS TIME ! AAH ! JUST LET ME GO ! OH , MY GOD . WHERE IS HE ? DOWN HERE . HE 'S IN THERE . EASY . I - I TOLD YOU HE WON 'T LET ME DIE . I DON 'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE . I TOLD THEM AND I TOLD THEM , BUT THEY WON 'T LISTEN . YOU MEAN THEY DON 'T BELIEVE YOU . NO , SIR . YOU SAID IN THE REPORT THAT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT , YOU BELIEVED SOMEBODY WAS IN THE ROOM . IT WAS NO ACCIDENT . DON 'T YOU UNDERSTAND ? BUT THIS PERSON SAVED YOUR LIFE , IS THAT RIGHT ? LOOK AT ME . LOOK ! I HAVE NO LIFE . HE TOOK IT ALL AWAY . DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO IT IS ? I NEVER SEE HIM CLEARLY , BUT HE LOOKS LIKE A SOLDIER , ALWAYS STANDIN ' AT ATTENTION . - G.I. ? - OR ONE OF SADDAM 'S BOYS , COME BACK TO HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE . WHOEVER IT IS , HE KNOWS MY NAME . HE SPEAKS TO YOU ? " YOUR TIME HAS COME , " HE SAID . THEN HE STARTED TAKIN ' IT ALL AWAY . WHAT DID HE START TAKING AWAY ? EVERYTHING . MY WIFE , MY CHILDREN . AND HOW DID HE DO THAT ? HOW DID - HE BURNED THEM ALIVE . NOW HE MAKES ME SUFFER ... BECAUSE HE WON 'T LET ME DIE . AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY , MAY I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU ? I 'VE BEEN ASKED TO HAVE YOU SUSPEND WHATEVER INVESTIGATION YOU 'VE BEGUN HERE . ASKED BY WHOM , CAPTAIN . GENERAL CALLAHAN , LIEUTENANT COLONEL STANS ' COMMANDING OFFICER . - IS SOMETHING WRONG ? - PROTOCOL REQUIRES ... ALL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF MILITARY PERSONNEL ... TO BE CONDUCTED THROUGH MILITARY CHANNELS AND THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICER . WHAT ? WE DIDN 'T SIGN IN AT THE FRONT DESK ? YOU 'RE IN BREACH OF CODE AND PROCEDURE . EXCUSE ME , BUT DOES GENERAL CALLAHAN HAVE A SUPERIOR OFFICER ? MA 'AM ? ASSUMING THAT WE WANTED TO INVESTIGATE HIM , - WHO WOULD WE TALK TO ? - INVESTIGATE HIM FOR WHAT ? - WHATEVER . - GENERAL CALLAHAN IS THE SENIOR OFFICER HERE . - WELL , THEN , WE 'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO HIM ON OUR WAY OUT . - I DON 'T KNOW HE 'S AVAILABLE . ASK HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF AVAILABLE . TELL HIM THAT IT 'S OUR PROTOCOL . IN THE MEANTIME , WE WOULD LIKE TO FINISH UP WITH LIEUTENANT COLONEL STANS . YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN HE MIGHT TRY AND KILL HIMSELF AGAIN . LET 'S FINISH THIS , MULDER . I KEEP HAVING THE SAME DREAM ALMOST EVERY NIGHT . I KNOW A LOT OF CRIPS " THE WALK . " IN MY DREAM , I RISE UP OUT OF MY CHAIR , I CAN STAND . AND I LOOK DOWN THE HALLWAY , ONLY I 'M NOT IN THE WARD ANYMORE , I 'M AT HOME . THERE 'S MY BABY GIRL . WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT , I TAKE A STEP TOWARDS HER , AND I TAKE ANOTHER STEP . THEN I PICK HER UP AND I CARRY HER OUTSIDE ON MY OWN TWO FEET . OUTSIDE IS MY LITTLE BOY . WE RUN TOGETHER . RUNNING . ME ! MY LEGS , LIKE THEY WERE BEFORE . WE PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF FOOTBALL . I SHOW HIM A FEW MOVES . YOU KNOW , LIKE THE OLD MAN USED TO DO . WE JUST WALK HOME . NO CRUTCHES , NO WHEELCHAIRS . I KNOW I 'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN , BUT THIS DREAM SEEMS SO REAL . I CAN 'T HELP BUT THINK THAT MAYBE SOMEDAY - DON 'T HOLD YOUR BREATH . I THINK WE 'D ALL BE INTERESTED IN YOUR POINT OF VIEW , LEONARD . OH , YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW WHAT I THINK ? I PITY ALL YOU GUYS . I REALLY DO . WITH YOUR HANDICAPPED BASKETBALL AND YOUR WHEELCHAIR RACES . YOU ALL ACT LIKE WE 'RE NORMAL PEOPLE . - WE ARE NORMAL PEOPLE . - I DON 'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A LOOK IN THE MIRROR , MY FRIEND , BUT YOU ARE MISSING A LEG . I - I DON 'T HAVE ANY . WHERE - WHERE 'D MY ARMS GO ? - WE ALL KNOW HOW YOU FEEL . - NO , YOU DON 'T . HOW THE HELL COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW HOW I FEEL ? THERE 'S ONLY ONE WAY YOU COULD EVER KNOW , AND I CAN ONLY PRAY TO GOD THAT HE 'LL COME DOWN AND TAKE YOUR LEGS AND ARMS AWAY ... AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE ! ROACH . I 'M SORRY , GENTLEMEN . LET 'S BEGIN AGAIN . WHAT IS IT , ROACH ? WHAT 'S WHAT ? YOU GOT THAT " I 'M FREAKIN' OUT " LOOK ON YOUR FACE . WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? IT 'S NOTHING . BULL . I SPENT TWO YEARS WITH YOUR SORRY ASS IN A GUN TURRET . I THINK I KNOW WHEN YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND . COME ON , PRIVATE . MAKE YOUR REPORT . IT 'S THE F.B.I. , MAN . THEY 'RE DOWNSTAIRS . THEY 'RE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE L.C. THE HELL WITH THE FEDS . ALL RIGHT , ROACH ? DO YOU HEAR ME ? THE HELL WITH THEM . JUST FORGET ABOUT THEM . GENERAL . SIR ? AGENTS MULDER AND SCULLY TO SEE YOU , SIR . THANK YOU , CAPTAIN . I WANT YOU TO KNOW ... GENERAL . I 'VE HAD THE CAPTAIN CONTACT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ... AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THE F.B.I. ' s GROSS MISCONDUCT HERE . I GUESS THIS ISN 'T A GOOD TIME TO THANK YOU FOR SEEING US . LET ME ASSURE YOU , THIS MATTER WILL NOT GO UNADDRESSED . I WOULD HOPE NOT , CONSIDERING THE EXTREMITY OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL STANS ' CASE . WHAT CASE ? THERE 'S NO CASE . STANS IS A VERY SICK MAN . YES , SO WE GATHERED . BUT HIS FILE IS MISSING ... SEVERAL IMPORTANT FACTS WHICH CAME OUT IN OUR INTERVIEW WITH HIM . I 'M SURE EVERYTHING GERMANE TO STANS ' SITUATION IS ON FILE . EXCEPT FOR ANY MENTION OF THE DEATH OF HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN ... IN A HOUSE FIRE THREE MONTHS AGO . WELL , IT WAS A TRAGIC ACCIDENT . NO DOUBT . BUT THERE IS NO RECORD OF ANY CRIMINAL OR ARSON INVESTIGATION . STANS TRIED TO SAVE HIS FAMILY THAT NIGHT . WELL , ACCORDING TO HIM , HE WAS PREVENTED FROM DOING SO ... BY SOME KIND OF PHANTOM SOLDIER . LOOK . I 'VE KNOWN STANS A LONG TIME , AND THERE 'S NO DOUBT THAT HE HAS SUFFERED TERRIBLY . NOT UNLIKE STAFF SERGEANT KEVIN AIKLEN . YOU KNOW SERGEANT AIKLEN , ISN 'T THAT CORRECT , SIR ? HE SERVED UNDER ME IN THE GULF , YES . SIX MONTHS AGO , AIKLEN ALSO LOST HIS FAMILY TO A HOUSE FIRE . AFTERWARDS , HE RECEIVED PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT FOR DELUSIONAL BEHAVIOR , TELLING THE DOCTORS THAT HE WANTED TO DIE , BUT THAT SOMEBODY WOULDN 'T LET HIM . BEFORE THROWING HIMSELF INTO A WOOD CHIPPER ON THE HOSPITAL GROUNDS . NOW , UNLESS THAT 'S PROCEDURE AND PROTOCOL , I 'D SAY THE COINCIDENCE OF DETAIL HAS BEEN RATHER STRANGELY OVERLOOKED , SIR . HOLD ON . JUST WHO 'S UNDER SUSPICION HERE ? LOOK . I MAKE NO EXCUSES FOR THE SADNESS OF THESE MEN 'S LIVES . THEY ARE CASUALTIES OF WAR . ONCE BRAVE MEN WHO WE CAN DO LITTLE BUT FEEL SORRY FOR . IF YOU THINK THERE 'S MORE TO IT , YOU ARE SERIOUSLY MISTAKEN . THAT 'S YOUR CONCLUSION , GENERAL . BUT I 'D HOPE YOU 'D ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO OUR OWN . DO YOU REALLY THINK THE GENERAL 'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE ? NO . I THINK HE 'S GOT EVERYTHING TO HIDE . YOU DON 'T THINK HE 'S JUST CLOSING RANKS TO PROTECT HIS MEN ? MULDER , I KNOW IT 'S NOT WHAT DREW YOU TO THIS CASE TO BEGIN WITH , BUT I THINK IT 'S VERY CLEAR WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE . WHAT 'S THAT ? THE GENERAL IS PROTECTING HIS MEN , BUT WHAT HE 'S PROTECTING THEM FROM ... IS PROSECUTION FOR THE MURDER OF THEIR FAMILIES . - WHY WOULD HE DO THAT ? - I DON 'T KNOW . BUT I CAN THINK OF SEVERAL GOOD REASONS . BECAUSE THEY WERE HIS SOLDIERS AND HE FEELS SOMEWHAT RESPONSIBLE ... - FOR THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE PLAYED OUT ? - THAT COULD BE ONE . OR MAYBE HE KNOWS THE DEEPER SECRETS TO THEIR MADNESS , THE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS THEY WERE EXPOSED TO DURING THE WAR , THE CAUSE OF THE EFFECT . CONSIDERING THE GOVERNMENT 'S ABSOLUTE DISAVOWAL OF GULF WAR SYNDROME , I 'D SAY IT 'S A PRETTY GOOD REASON TO PREVENT OUR INVESTIGATION . BUT YOU 'RE NOT BUYING IT . NO . WHAT I CAN 'T FIGURE OUT IS WHY A MAN WHO SO DELIBERATELY AND METHODICALLY ... SET OUT TO COMMIT SUICIDE WOULD LEAVE THE ONE ENTRANCE TO THE ROOM UNSECURED . BUT THEN AGAIN , I OBVIOUSLY HAVE A FEEBLE GRASP OF ARMY PROTOCOL AND PROCEDURE . COME IN . I WANT TO APOLOGIZE , SIR . I DIDN 'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT LIKE THAT EARLIER . I KNOW THAT , CAPTAIN . THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS UNFORTUNATE . IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I CAN DO ? NO . GO HOME AND GET SOME REST . WE 'LL DEAL WITH IT IN THE MORNING . RELAX , CAPTAIN . THAT 'S AN ORDER . YES , SIR . YOUR TIME HAS COME , KILLER . GENERAL CALLAHAN . ONE OF THE DETECTIVES IS SAYING CAPTAIN DRAPER 'S DEATH WASN 'T ACCIDENTAL . THERE ARE BRUISES AROUND HER NECK AND HER SHOULDER , ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF FINGER MARKS . AND SOMEONE DROWNED HER ? THE BRUISES AND SURROUNDING EDEMA ARE CONSISTENT WITH A STRUGGLE . WILL YOU BE CONTACTING HER FAMILY ? SHE HAD NO FAMILY . THE ARMY WAS HER FAMILY . I 'M SORRY . TRULY . I TALKED WITH SECURITY PERSONNEL . OTHER THAN CAPTAIN DRAPER , THEY SAW NO ONE ENTER THE POOL LAST NIGHT AND NO ONE LEAVE . BUT THE OFFICERS ARE SAYING SHE WAS DROWNED . - GENERAL , DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY OF YOUR OWN ? - YES . WHY ? IF THE PATTERN WE 'VE SEEN IS AT ALL CONSISTENT , YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MAY BE IN DANGER . BASED ON WHAT , THE DEATH OF MY ADJUTANT ? JUST KEEP AN EYE ON THEM . WATCH OUT FOR ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY . MULDER , YOU 'RE SERIOUS ? THIS IS A MILITARY BASE , SCULLY . THEY 'VE GOT SECURITY EVERYWHERE . NO ONE SAW OR HEARD A THING . IT 'S NOT SO HARD TO BELIEVE . HER SCREAMS WOULD HAVE BEEN MUFFLED UNDERWATER . THERE WOULD BE NO FINGERPRINTS . IT ALSO FITS THE M.O. OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL STANS ' PHANTOM KILLER . AGENT MULDER , WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT ? IT WAS JUST A WORD TO THE WISE , SIR . NO , I MEAN " ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY . " ANY UNUSUAL OR UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA . LAST NIGHT , I SAW SOMEONE IN MY OFFICE . HE SAID MY NAME , BUT WHEN I TURNED AROUND , HE WAS GONE . THEN , MY PHONE MACHINE WENT ALL SNAKY AGAIN . AGAIN ? THIS HAPPENED BEFORE ? NO , NOT WHAT I SAW . BUT THE PHONE CALLS , YES . TWICE BEFORE AT MY HOME . MOM , MAIL 'S HERE ! MOM ! MOM ! MOM ! MOM ! MOM ! WHAT IS IT ? WHAT IS IT , HONEY ? MOM , THERE WAS A MAN HERE . WHO ? OH , THANK GOD YOU 'RE HOME . I WAS TRYING TO REACH YOU . TREVOR SAW SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO . IS HE ALL RIGHT ? WELL , HE 'S UPSTAIRS IN HIS ROOM , BUT HE 'S TERRIFIED . I 'M - I 'M SHAKING MYSELF . FRANCES , THESE PEOPLE ARE WITH THE F.B.I. IS IT ABOUT THE BREAK-IN ? WHY DON 'T YOU CHECK ON TREVOR ? I 'LL BE RIGHT UP . WHY ? WHAT 'S HAPPENING ? FRANCES , PLEASE . WE 'LL TALK UPSTAIRS . THIS WAY . IT JUST COMES ON . THE PHONE DOESN 'T EVEN RING . AT FIRST , I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRANK . DID YOU SAVE THE OTHER ONES ? NO , I ERASED THEM . I EVEN CALLED THE PHONE COMPANY , HAD THEM CHECK THE LINE . THEY CHECKED THE WHOLE HOUSE . THEY COULDN 'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG . HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY OTHER TYPE OF ELECTRONIC INTERFERENCE , LIKE THE RADIO OR THE TELEVISION ? NO . NOT A THING . THERE 'S SOMEONE IN THE BACKYARD . I SAW SOMEONE OUT HERE . I 'M SURE OF IT . LOOK . YOU 'D BETTER CALL THE POLICE , GENERAL . YOU 'RE GONNA FEEL A LITTLE STICK HERE . THAT 'S RIGHT . I CAN 'T CHANGE THE DOSAGE . THERE . THAT 'S FINE . I 'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE . THAT WAS TOO CLOSE , MAN . I AIN 'T DOING IT ANYMORE . - WHAT ? - I SAID I AIN 'T DOING IT ANYMORE . YOU OWE ME , ROACH . I WOULDN 'T BE IN THIS DAMN CHAIR IF IT WASN 'T FOR YOU . HEY ! THIS ISN 'T ABOUT YOU AND ME , MAN . THIS IS ABOUT ALL THE GRUNTS AND ALL THE CRIPS ... AND ALL THE BOYS WHO CAME HOME IN A BOX . THE ENEMY MUST BE DEFEATED , AND WE 'RE GONNA DO IT . YOU 'RE GONNA DO YOUR PART , AND I 'M GONNA DO MINE . NURSE ! HEY ! WHAT DO YOU DO , MAN , WHEN I RAP ON THE TANK ? GET SOME , GET SOME , FIRE AT WILL . GOOD . YOU 'RE ALL RIGHT . NURSE , COME ON ! THIS IS KILLIN ' ME HERE ! WHAT A MESS . YOU 'VE GOT TO LEARN TO SIT STILL . HOW ABOUT YOU NEVER DO IT RIGHT ? THERE . THAT OUGHTA HOLD IT . FIND ANYTHING ? NO . BUT I 'M REALLY BEGINNING TO LIKE THE TUNE . WELL , WE 'VE BEEN A BIT LUCKIER . WHOEVER 'S TARGETED THE GENERAL DIDN 'T JUST LEAVE FOOTPRINTS . THEY LEFT FINGERPRINTS AS WELL . REALLY . WHERE ? FORENSICS JUST LIFTED TWO MATCHING INDEXES AND A THUMB . ONE ON THE MAILBOX NEXT TO THE FRONT DOOR AND ONE ON THE DOOR LEADING TO THE BACKYARD . WE 'D BETTER GO RUN ' EM . THEY 'RE ON THEIR WAY TO THE N.C.I.C. AS WE SPEAK . F.B.I. OPEN THE DOOR ! HANDS UP ! HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD ! DON 'T SHOOT ! TURN AROUND ! OKAY , OKAY , OKAY , OKAY , OKAY , OKAY . PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN BEHIND YOUR BACK . CUFF HIM . QUINTON FREELY , YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR SUSPICION OF MURDER . YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT . ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE HELD AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW . IF YOU WANT AN ATTORNEY , WE 'LL GIVE YOU ONE IF YOU DON 'T HAVE ONE ... " CAPTAIN JANET DRAPER . STAFF SERGEANT KEVIN AIKLEN . LIEUTENANT COLONEL VICTOR STANS . " GENERAL AND MRS. THOMAS CALLAHAN . WE 'VE GOT HIM , MULDER . WATCH YOUR LEFT FLANK THERE . OKAY . TREVOR ? HEY , TREVOR ! WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PLACE YOU AT EACH OF THE CRIME SCENES . IN ADDITION TO ACCESSORY TO MURDER , YOU 'RE LOOKING AT CONSPIRACY , BREAKING AND ENTERING , COMMISSION OF A FELONY ON FEDERAL PROPERTY - - CAN I GET A CIGARETTE ? - NO . WE KNOW YOU WEREN 'T ACTING ALONE , QUINTON . WE KNOW YOU HAD AN ACCOMPLICE . HOW DID HE DO IT , QUINTON ? I DON 'T KNOW . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . HOW DID HE GET PAST THE GUARD ? HOW DID HE KILL HIM ? TREVOR WAS ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLD . I DON 'T KNOW . I DIDN 'T KILL ANYBODY . I 'M JUST THE MAILMAN . WHAT DOES THAT MEAN , " YOU 'RE JUST THE MAILMAN " ? I 'M RAPPO 'S MAILMAN . LEONARD TRIMBLE , RIGHT ? IF THAT 'S THE MAN THEY CALL RAPPO . THAT 'S HIM . WHAT 'S HE DONE ? HE 'S A SUSPECT IN TWO HOMICIDES . RAPPO ? YOU MUST BE MAKING SOME KIND OF MISTAKE . HOW 'S THAT ? THERE . SEE FOR YOURSELF . HE 'S A QUADRUPLE AMPUTEE . DAMN IT . HE LIED TO US . HE SAID HE WAS THE MAILMAN . WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . I 'M ADDING IT TO THE LIST . ARE YOU COMING ? NO . I 'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER . HE KNOWS THIS PLACE . HE CAN FIND ME HERE . HE KNOWS THIS PLACE ! HE 'S BEEN HERE BEFORE ! I 'M NOT SAFE HERE ! HEY , KEEP IT DOWN IN THERE ! LET ME OUTTA HERE ! HE 'S GOING TO KILL ME ! I 'M A DEAD MAN ! LET ME OUT ! LET ME OUT ! I 'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU AGAIN . HE 'S GONNA KILL ME ! HE 'S HERE ! HE 'S HERE ! YOU DON 'T WANNA GET HIM STARTED AGAIN . HE WAS PRETTY WORKED UP ABOUT AN HOUR AGO . NOT AS WORKED UP AS I 'M GONNA BE . VISITOR . ON YOUR FEET ! GOD ALMIGHTY . HOW DID IT HAPPEN ? SUFFOCATION . THE BEDSHEET WAS STUFFED DOWN HIS THROAT . NOBODY 'D BEEN IN THE CELL WITH HIM ? HE DID ALL IT BY HIMSELF . NOT LIKELY . NOT LIKELY ? HE HAD HELP , SCULLY . AND HE WASN 'T LYING BECAUSE I THINK THE MAN ... THAT KILLED HIM WAS LEONARD TRIMBLE . RAPPO ? YEAH . HE CAN 'T EVEN WALK , LET ALONE KILL SOMEBODY . YOU SEE THIS ? THIS IS A DENTAL X-RAY PLATE . I KNOW , YOU 'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND WITH THIS SINCE WE GOT HERE . NO , ACTUALLY , THE ONES I 'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND WITH I HAD DEVELOPED AT THE HOSPITAL . SEE , THIS IS THE ONE I WAS CARRYING WHEN WE FIRST ME STANS , THIS ONE IN THE REHAB ROOM , IN THE POOL , IN THE GENERAL 'S OFFICE AND THIS ONE AT THE GENERAL 'S HOUSE . ALL OF THEM EXPOSED TO SOME KIND OF RADIATION . FROM WHAT ? FROM STANS ' PHANTOM SOLDIER . I CAME DOWN HERE WONDERING IF IT COULD BE TRUE , IF WHAT LIEUTENANT COLONEL STANS WAS DESCRIBING WAS A CASE OF ASTRAL PROJECTION . WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING IS THIS MAN , RAPPO , IS LEAVING HIS BODY AND FLOATING AROUND TOWN KILLING PEOPLE ? PRACTITIONERS CLAIM THAT DURING A SELF-HYPNOTIC TRANCE , THE ASTRAL BODY CAN ACTUALLY DETACH ITSELF AND FLOAT VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE , SOMETIMES INVISIBLE , BUT SOMETIMES APPEARING AS AN APPARITION . THEY EVEN CLAIM THAT THE ASTRAL BODY HAS PSYCHOKINETIC CAPABILITIES ... FAR GREATER THAN THE CORPOREAL BODY . MULDER - THEN WHY WOULD HE NEED QUINTON FREELY ? WELL , MAYBE HE NEEDS A PSYCHIC CONNECTION TO A PLACE THING OR OBJECT - A LETTER . THAT 'S WHY QUINTON CALLED HIMSELF THE MAILMAN . IT 'S INSANE . SOMETIMES THE ONLY SANE RESPONSE TO AN INSANE WORLD IS INSANITY . YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BACKWARDS MASKING ? YOU MEAN MESSAGES RECORDED BACKWARDS IN SONGS ? YEAH . OR ON THE GENERAL 'S ANSWERING MACHINE . CHECK THIS OUT . YOUR TIME HAS COME , KILLER . YOUR TIME HAS COME . - LEONARD TRIMBLE ? - NO , IT 'S FRED ASTAIRE . MR. TRIMBLE , WE 'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT QUINTON FREELY . ROACH ? WHAT 'S HE DONE NOW ? HE 'S DEAD . OH . WELL , SERVES HIM RIGHT . HOW 'S THAT ? HOW 'S THAT ? HE 'S ONLY THE GUY WHO TURNED ME INTO SECOND BASE BY GETTING MY ARMS AND LEGS BLOWN OFF . OTHER THAN THAT , HE WAS A REAL GOOD GUY . THEN WHY 'D YOU KILL HIM ? WHAT 'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE ? WE READ YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS , LEONARD . WE KNOW THAT YOU 'VE REFUSED ALL EFFORTS AT REHABILITATION . YOU 'VE EVEN REFUSED TO BE FITTED WITH PROSTHETIC LIMBS . BIG DEAL . MAYBE I DON 'T WANT ANY OF THAT CRAP . MAYBE BECAUSE YOU DON 'T NEED IT ... BECAUSE YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR BODY ANY TIME YOU WANT . KILL ANYBODY YOU WANNA KILL . IF I COULD LEAVE MY BODY NOW , I COULD THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE I 'D RATHER BE DOING . LIKE KILL GENERAL CALLAHAN 'S BOY ? LIEUTENANT COLONEL STANS' FAMILY ? SERGEANT AIKLEN ? YOU 'RE A REAL TRIP . OH , I 'M " A TRIP " ? BECAUSE I FIGURED YOU OUT ? YOU 'RE A SOLDIER . YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GETTIN ' INTO WHEN YOU ENLISTED . YOU WANT TO BLAME EVERYBODY ELSE . WHY BLAME YOUR C.O.s ? I BLAME THEM FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US . YOU DON 'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE . YOU - YOU SAT AT HOME AND WATCHED THE WAR ... ON CABLE TV LIKE IT WAS A DAMN VIDEO GAME . YOU HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THE GUYS THAT DIED , ABOUT THE BLOOD IN THE SAND , WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN A HIT COMES . THE THING IS , YOU JUST DON 'T CARE , DO YOU ? YOU GOT YOUR CRUDE OIL . JUST CHANGE THAT STATION , RIGHT ? KILLER GOT HIS PRIME TIME . L.C. GOT HIS FANCY LITTLE MEDALS . NOW TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ME . WHAT DID I GET ? NOBODY KNOWS HOW I FEEL . THEY TOOK MY LIFE AWAY .

HARDY-HAR-HAR . WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO ? CALL GENERAL CALLAHAN AND WARN HIM TO STAY OUT OF HIS HOUSE . FRANCES ? HONEY , LEAVE THAT . NO , I KNOW HOW IT UPSETS YOU WHEN HIS ...

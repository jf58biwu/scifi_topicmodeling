 ALL RIGHT , LET 'S SHOOT THIS , MARTY . HOLD IT STILL . [ Bug Buzzing ] HOLD IT STILL , SLOAN . I 'D LIKE TO SEE YOU HOLD IT STILL . THE SOONER THEY PAVE OVER THIS SWAMP , THE BETTER . IT 'S NOT A SWAMP . YOU 'RE STANDING IN A FOREST WITH INDIGENOUS PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES ... YOU 'RE OBVIOUSLY TOO IGNORANT TO APPRECIATE . MARK IT . GIVE ME ANOTHER POSITION . LET 'S SHOOT THIS ONE CAREFULLY . THIS IS WHERE THEY 'RE GONNA PUT THE BLOCKBUSTER . YOU 'RE A REAL MORON , SLOAN . YOU KNOW THAT ? TREE HUGGER . YOU SHOULD BE SAD TO SEE THE DEMISE OF AN ECOSYSTEM THAT 'S LASTED A THOUSAND YEARS . WE ALL SHOULD BE . GIVE ME FOUR FEET TO YOUR LEFT . I CAN 'T . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , YOU CAN 'T ? I MEAN I CAN 'T BECAUSE IT 'S STUCK . THEN UNSTICK IT . THIS IS WEIRD . [ Screaming ] SLOAN ? SLOAN ? [ Panting ] [ Bug Buzzing ] [ Screaming ] LOUIS , LET BO DO THE WORK . HOW 'S HE GONNA FIND A POSSUM ? SHH . ANIMALS SENSE THINGS THAT WE CAN 'T . THAT 'S HOW THEY SURVIVE . IS THAT HOW BO KNOWS HOW TO HUNT ? YEP . OUR ANCESTORS WERE HUNTERS TOO , BUT MOST OF US HAVE LOST THOSE INSTINCTS . THAT 'S WHY WE NEED A LITTLE HELP . DAD , WHAT 'S THAT ? SURVEYOR 'S EQUIPMENT . SOMEONE LEFT HIS STUFF OUT HERE . [ Barking ] [ Barking Continues ] STAY CLOSE , LOUIS . [ Dog Whimpering ] WHAT IS IT , DAD ? DAD ? BO . COME HERE , BO . WHAT- - QUIET ! [ Rustling ] LISTEN TO ME . I WANT YOU TO TAKE BO AND RUN STRAIGHT HOME . WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? I WANT YOU TO RUN STRAIGHT HOME , AND I DON 'T WANT YOU TO STOP FOR ANYTHING . - LOUIS , YOU UNDERSTAND ? - I JUST- - ALL RIGHT , GO . [ Rustling ] COME ON , BO , COME ON ! [ Rifle Shot ] [ Rifle Shot ] BO , NO , NO ! COME ON , BO , COME ON ! [ Barking ] COME ON ! COME ON ! [ Man ] LAST YEAR WAS SOMETHING OF A PERSONAL REVELATION . WE WERE DOING AN EXERCISE CALLED " TEAM BUILDERS , " WHERE WE WERE GIVEN TWO MINUTES TO BUILD A TOWER ... OUT OF ORDINARY OFFICE FURNITURE . WHEN I STOOD ON MIKE 'S SHOULDERS AND I PUT THAT ELECTRIC PENCIL SHARPENER ... ON TOP OF THE PILE , WE BOTH KNEW- - WE COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT ALONE . KILL ME NOW . YOU EVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE TEAM SEMINARS , AGENT SCULLY ? UM , I THINK I WENT TO A CONSTRUCTIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING COURSE ... WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE BUREAU . DID YOU PLAY THAT GAME WHERE YOU CAN 'T USE ANY NEGATIVE WORDS ? I COULDN 'T BELIEVE HOW HARD IT WAS NOT TO USE THE WORD " BUT . " I 'M HAVING THAT SAME PROBLEM RIGHT NOW ! HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A TEAM SEMINAR , AGENT MULDER ? NO . UNFORTUNATELY AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR ... I ALWAYS DEVELOP A SEVERE HEMORRHOIDAL CONDITION . WELL , IT BUILDS MUSCLES YOU DIDN 'T EVEN KNOW YOU HAD . COMMUNICATION . THAT 'S THE KEY . SORRY , FOLKS . IT 'LL BE A FEW MINUTES . - WHAT 'S GOING ON , OFFICER ? - GOT A LITTLE SITUATION , IS ALL . THANK YOU , JESUS . WHERE 'S HE GOING ? OH , EXCUSE ME ! ARE YOU FROM SEARCH AND RESCUE ? NO , I 'M SORRY . I 'M JUST STRETCHING MY LEGS . THEY SAID THEY 'D HAVE WORD WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND . I NEED SOMEBODY TO TELL ME WHAT 'S GOING ON . JUST SLOW DOWN . I DON 'T KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT . MY HUSBAND , MICHAEL , HE WAS TEACHING OUR SON TO SHOOT . HE SAID THE DOG GOT SPOOKED , AND THEN HE HEARD GUNSHOTS . NOW THEY 'VE FOUND A JACKET WITH BLOOD ON IT , BUT THEY WON 'T TELL ME ABOUT MY HUSBAND . I 'LL TRY TO FIND OUT WHO 'S IN CHARGE , ALL RIGHT ? THANK YOU . NOW WHERE 'S HE GOING ? HEY , STONECYPHER , TAKE A LOOK AT THIS . THIS TREE WAS HERE 20 YEARS BEFORE PONCE de LEON LANDED . WE 'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR THE WINE AND CHEESE RECEPTION . [ Man ] OFFICER FAZEKAS ? YES ? - CAN I HELP YOU ? - MY NAME IS FOX MULDER . I 'M AN AGENT WITH THE F.B.I. F.B.I. ? WHO CALLED YOU GUYS OUT ? NOBODY . WE GOT STOPPED AT YOUR ROADBLOCK . SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A SHOOTING . SHOTS WERE REPORTED , BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF ANYONE BEING SHOT . WHAT DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE OF ? A SURVEY TEAM WORKING THESE WOODS DIDN 'T REPORT IN LAST NIGHT . WE FOUND ONE MAN 'S BLOODY JACKET , PRETTY TORN UP . AND THIS MORNING , A BOY GOT SEPARATED FROM HIS FATHER . SEPARATED BY WHAT ? IT LOOKS MAYBE ... LIKE SOME KIND OF ANIMAL ATTACK . WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL ? I 'M NOT SURE YET . I FOLLOWED GOOD TRACKS FOR THE TWO SURVEYORS , BUT THE TRAILS BECAME CONFUSED AS THEY MOVED INTO THE BRUSH . THERE WAS A THIRD SET OF TRACKS LEADING AWAY ... I COULDN 'T IDENTIFY . COULDN 'T IDENTIFY AS THE SURVEYORS ' ? AS MAN OR ANIMAL . - MULDER ? - JUST , UH- - H-HOLD ON A SECOND . WHAT ABOUT THE BOY 'S FATHER ? I TRACKED HIM ALL THE WAY DOWN TO WHERE HE FIRED THE SHOT . THE GROUND 'S ROCKY , BUT FROM THE DEPRESSIONS IN THE UNDERLYING SOIL , I CAN TELL YOU THAT HE ENTERED THE BUSHES FROM OVER THERE ... WHERE I PICK UP ANOTHER SET OF TRACKS , TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT SET OF TRACKS THAT FROM THE WAY ... THE GROUND 'S UPSET , IS PROBABLY WHERE THE MAN WAS ATTACKED . BUT NO OTHER SIGN OF HIM ? YOU HAVE PANTHER IN THESE WOODS ? THERE 'S PANTHER , BEAR . BUT THESE TRACKS LOOK LIKE NEITHER OF THOSE . NO , SIR . YOU KNOW OF A GOOD MOTEL IN THE AREA ? EXCUSE ME . I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THIS VERY WELL ON OUR OWN . THANKS . MULDER ? WE 'VE GOT THIS CONFERENCE . THEY 'RE WAITING . YEAH . HOW DO I SAY THIS WITHOUT USING ANY NEGATIVE WORDS , SCULLY ? YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM THAT YOU 'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO THIS YEAR 'S TEAMWORK SEMINAR . SEE ? WE DON 'T NEED THAT CONFERENCE . WE HAVE COMMUNICATION LIKE THAT UNSPOKEN . YOU KNOW WHAT I 'M THINKING . [ Laughing ] LOOK ! HE 'S ALL EATEN AWAY . HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT , EH ? [ TV Off ] HE 'S NOT COMING BACK , IS HE ? NOW , WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ? DAD 'S A GOOD SHOT . IF HE HIT WHAT HE WAS AIMING AT , HE 'D BE HOME BY NOW . YOU GOTTA BE BRAVE , LOUIS . WE BOTH GOTTA BE BRAVE . WE 'LL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT IN THE MORNING . GET SOME SLEEP NOW . [ Whimpering ] [ Knocking On Door ] IT 'S OPEN . WHO CUT THE CHEESE ? SINCE YOU WON 'T BE MAKING IT TO THE CONFERENCE . MMM ! PAR-TAY ! HOWEVER , I MUST REMIND YOU , THIS GOES AGAINST THE BUREAU 'S POLICY ... OF MALE AND FEMALE AGENTS CONSORTING IN THE SAME MOTEL ROOM WHILE ON ASSIGNMENT . TRY ANY OF THAT " TAILHOOK " CRAP ON ME , SCULLY , I 'LL KICK YOUR ASS . IT 'S A POP QUIZ . WHAT ANIMAL WILL ATTACK THE STRONGEST , LEAVING THE WEAKEST TO ESCAPE ? THE ANSWER IS " NONE . " NOT ONE OF THE OVER 4,000 SPECIES NATIVE TO NORTH AMERICA ... WILL ATTACK THE STRONGEST WHEN THE WEAK IS VULNERABLE . AND WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING ? IT MAKES ME THINK THAT WHAT WE 'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS NO ORDINARY PREDATOR . I THOUGHT THIS WAS A PLOY TO GET OUT OF THE CONFERENCE . I THINK WHAT WE 'VE STUMBLED UPON HERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN LOCAL AUTHORITIES REALIZE . THE SCENARIO DESCRIBED BY THAT BOY SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A PRIMITIVE CULLING TECHNIQUE . WE 'RE IN WESTERN FLORIDA . THE CLOSEST THING TO PRIMITIVE DOWN HERE ... IS LIVING IN A BEACHFRONT RETIREMENT CONDO . THOSE WOODS ARE AS OLD AS ANYTHING IN THE SOUTH . THERE 'S 800 SQUARE MILES OF IT . THERE 'S NO TELLING WHAT 'S ALIVE OUT THERE . WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? I 'VE GOTTA CHECK SOMETHING OUT . SOMETIMES I THINK SOME WORK ON YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS WOULDN 'T BE SUCH A BAD IDEA . I 'LL BE BACK SOON , AND WE CAN BUILD A TOWER OF FURNITURE . OKAY ? [ Barking ] [ Whining , Barking ] WHAT IS IT , BO ? [ Barking ] MOM ? IT 'S ALL RIGHT , LOUIS . YOU GO BACK TO SLEEP NOW . [ Barking ] [ Barking ] BO ? BO ? BO , WHERE 'D YOU GET TO ? [ Rustling ] BO , IS THAT YOU ? - [ Growls ] - [ Gasps ] COME HOME , BOY . LET 'S GO BACK IN . [ Growling ] - [ Barking ] - ALL RIGHT , ALL RIGHT . STAY THERE THE NIGHT . LOUIS ? [ Pounding On Door ] LOUIS ? LOUIS ! LOUIS ! LOUIS ! LOUIS ! LOUIS ! MOM ! [ Screaming ] WHAT IS IT , LOUIS ? IT 'S IN THE HOUSE . HOW 'S IT GOING ? HE 'S STILL FREAKED OUT . I MIGHT HAVE SOME INSIGHT INTO THIS INVISIBLE CREATURE HE SAID WAS CHASING HIM . THE INVISIBLE MAN WAS INVISIBLE . RIGHT . HE SAID HE WAS CHASED BY A CREATURE WITH GLOWING RED EYES . LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING . MRS. ASEKOFF SAID SHE WENT OUTSIDE WITH THE DOG . WHEN SHE CAME BACK , THE DOOR WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE . AND ? LOOK AT THIS . WE GOT SOME TRACKS HERE . WHERE ? HERE AND HERE . DRIED MUD AGAINST THE TILE , TRACKED IN FROM THE OUTSIDE . IT COULD 'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN BY THE DOG . NO , NO . YOU SEE THE BALL OF THE FOOT HERE ? A LARGE FOOT . - AND I COUNT FIVE TOES . - WAIT , I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WASN 'T HUMAN . I 'M NOT SAYING IT IS . THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION IS ALL WRONG . PEOPLE WALK HEEL TO TOE . WHATEVER THIS THING IS , WALKS ON THE BALL OF ITS FOOT . YOU 'RE PUTTING ME ON . NO . MY DAD AND I WERE INDIAN GUIDES . I KNOW THESE THINGS . SO IF IT 'S NOT MAN AND IT 'S NOT ANIMAL , WHAT THE HELL IS IT ? GUESS I 'M A LITTLE LATE TO THIS DANCE . I FOUND SOME TRACKS ... RIGHT HERE . SAME AS I SAW BEFORE . WHERE WAS THAT ? IN THE WOODS . WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION 'S STRANGE . THEY APPEAR TO BE HUMAN , BUT WHOEVER LEFT THESE USES THE BALLS OF HIS FEET MORE LIKE AN ANIMAL . WHATEVER IT IS , IT 'S ATTACKED THREE GROWN MEN PRESUMABLY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT , DISPOSING OF ITS PREY WITHOUT DETECTION . AND IT WASN 'T SHY LAST NIGHT ABOUT COMING OUT OF THE WOODS TO TRY AGAIN . WHAT WE 'VE GOT IS A PREDATOR WITH LOW VISIBILITY AND A HIGH DEGREE OF MOTIVATION . IT 'S GOT ONE ADVANTAGE WE DON 'T HAVE- - THE ENTIRE APPALACHICOLA NATIONAL FOREST . THEN HOW DO YOU STOP IT ? BY IDENTIFYING IT . FINDING IT BEFORE IT FINDS SOMEBODY ELSE . IT 'S CALLED A " FLIR " FOR FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED . IT WAS DEVELOPED FOR CHOPPER PILOTS IN VIETNAM . DETECTS BODY HEAT AT 300 YARDS . THAT 'S PRETTY SOPHISTICATED FOR GOVERNMENT ISSUE . I SEE YOU TWO HAVE MET . JEFF 'S OUR LOCAL TECH-HEAD . SOME PEOPLE PREFER SEARCHING WITH DOGS . I PREFER AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS IF I GET IN TROUBLE . ARE WE READY TO GO ? ONCE WE START IN , YOU CAN PUT AWAY YOUR CELL PHONES . THE ONLY COMMUNICATION IN THESE WOODS IS WITH SHORTWAVE RADIOS . SO , STAY CLOSE , MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT . IF YOU GET LOST , INITIATE ORAL CONTACT . THAT MEANS HOLLER . IF NOBODY RESPONDS , SIT DOWN , DON 'T MOVE . I WILL FIND YOU . DON 'T GO LOOKING FOR ME . I KNOW IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS , BUT FOLKS STILL GET LOST . OKAY . I GOTCHA . THANK YOU . ALL RIGHT . LOCAL P.D. HAS ALL THEIR RESOURCES LOOKING OUT FOR A TRANSIENT , A DRIFTER WHO 'S WANTED FOR A DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN GASDEN , ALABAMA . THEY WERE AMUSED WHEN I TOLD THEM WHAT WE WERE DOING . I DON 'T THINK IT 'S A DRIFTER . WE MAY BE LOOKING FOR TWO INDIVIDUALS . WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ? THAT THING LURED THAT WOMAN OUT OF THE HOUSE ... TO SEPARATE HER FROM HER SON . FOR WHAT PURPOSE ? DIVIDE AND CONQUER . IF YOUR ENEMY HAS GREATER NUMBERS THAN YOU ... YOU DIVIDE AND CONQUER TO DIMINISH THOSE NUMBERS . WHAT ENEMY WOULD THAT BE ? ENCROACHING DEVELOPMENT . THAT 'S WHAT I SUSPECTED WHEN I WENT TO CHECK ON LOUIS AND HIS MOTHER . THIS IS ABOUT A HOUSING TRACT ? THAT SURVEY TEAM WAS STAKING OUT A NEW 100,000 ACRE PLOT . CIVILIZATION 'S PUSHING VERY HARD INTO THESE WOODS . MAYBE SOMETHING IN THESE WOODS IS PUSHING BACK . ANYTHING ? NO . NOTHING AT ALL , NOT EVEN WILDLIFE . ISN 'T THAT A LITTLE STRANGE ? YEAH . THIS FOREST IS USUALLY ALIVE WITH SOUND . I 'M NOT AN EXPERT , BUT I 'VE NEVER SEEN IT LIKE THIS BEFORE . SURE IS BEAUTIFUL , THOUGH . THAT 'S WHAT HAPPENS . PEOPLE GET TO LOOKING AROUND , NEXT THING THEY KNOW SOMETHING EATS THEM . WHAT DO YOU THINK KILLED THOSE MEN ? NATURE IS POPULATED BY CREATURES EITHER TRYING TO KILL SOMETHING THEY NEED TO SURVIVE , OR TRYING TO AVOID BEING KILLED BY SOMETHING THAT NEEDS THEM TO SURVIVE . IF WE BECOME BLINDED BY THE BEAUTY OF NATURE , WE MAY FAIL TO SEE ... ITS CRUELTY AND VIOLENCE . WALT WHITMAN ? NO . WHEN ANIMALS ATTACK ON THE FOX NETWORK . WAIT , I 'VE GOT SOMETHING . IT 'S ABOUT 20 YARDS AHEAD . WHERE ? I DON 'T SEE IT . IT 'S JUST SITTING THERE . IT 'S ON THE MOVE ! IT 'S MOVING FAST ! IT 'S-IT 'S GOING TO THE RIGHT ! WAIT ! THERE 'S TWO OF THEM NOW . THEY 'RE MOVING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS . THERE AND THERE . WHERE IS IT ? ABOUT 40 YARDS AHEAD OF YOU . I DON 'T SEE IT . NOW IT 'S GONE . I DON 'T KNOW WHERE IT WENT . WHAT IS IT ? I DON 'T KNOW . THEY 'RE TRYING TO SEPARATE US , PULL US AWAY FROM THE OTHERS . LET 'S GO BACK . [ Gasps ] MICHELLE ? MICHELLE ? [ Rustling ] [ Rustling ] MULDER , I NEED HELP ! [ Rustling ] MULDER ! SCULLY ! OVER HERE ! SCULLY ? OVER HERE . WHAT HAPPENED ? I DON 'T KNOW . WHERE 'S FAZEKAS ? SHE WAS WALKING AHEAD OF ME . SHE WAS RIGHT HERE , AND THEN SHE WAS JUST GONE . I 'M GETTING NO READING . - WHAT THE HELL 'S HAPPENING HERE ? - THEY SEPARATED US . THAT WAS ON PURPOSE . THEY DIVIDED US SO THEY COULD GO AFTER HER . SHE WAS IN THE LEAD , AND PRESUMABLY THE STRONGEST . THEY TAKE THE STRONGEST FIRST . TAKE THEM WHERE ? YOU CAN 'T JUST DISAPPEAR OUT HERE . YOU 'RE RIGHT . WE GOTTA FIND HER . HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW ! FORM A LINE AND BEAT THE BUSHES . MAYBE YOU 'LL PICK UP A SIGNAL . NO , WE NEED HELP . WE NEED MANPOWER . THAT 'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT HERE . WE NEED TO GET OUTTA HERE ! LISTEN TO ME . THE LONGER WE WAIT , THE LESS CHANCE WE HAVE OF FINDING HER . THIS IS NUTS . THIS IS LOONEY TUNE , MAN . WE GOTTA GO BACK OUT OF THESE WOODS BEFORE IT GETS DARK . OKAY , YOU 'RE RIGHT . YOU GO BACK . YOU LEAVE ME THE FLIR , AND YOU GO BACK . WE GOTTA GO TOGETHER . WE HAVE TO FIND HER . YEAH , WELL , IF WE STAY HERE , THEY MAY NOT FIND ANY OF US . MULDER , HE 'S RIGHT . WE WEREN 'T PREPARED FOR THIS . WE HAVE NO WAY OF TELLING THEM WHERE WE ARE . WE DON 'T HAVE ANY FOOD . MICHELLE HAD OUR ONLY WATER . I 'D LIKE TO FIND HER TOO , BUT I THINK THE RISKS OF THAT ARE WAY TOO FOOLISH . ALL RIGHT , WE ALL GO THEN . YOU LEAD THE WAY . I DON 'T HAVE MUCH FAITH THAT THIS DEVICE WILL DO US ANY GOOD . SO FAR , ALL IT 'S DONE IS SPLIT US UP . WHATEVER IT IS WE 'RE CHASING , DID SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN AT FIRST . WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ? NOTHING , EXCEPT WE 'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION . MAYBE IT CAN REGULATE ITS TEMPERATURE . YOU DON 'T KNOW OF ANY ANIMAL THAT CAN ? TICKS . I 'VE HEARD THEY CAN HALT THEIR METABOLISM ... FOR UP TO 18 YEARS , ESSENTIALLY GOING INTO SUSPENDED ANIMATION ... UNTIL SOMETHING WARM-BLOODED COMES ALONG . THAT 'S INTERESTING . WHY IS THAT INTERESTING ? THIRTY YEARS AGO , THE TOWN OF POINT PLEASANT , WEST VIRGINIA , WAS TERRORIZED FOR OVER A YEAR BY SOMETHING . KILLING LIVESTOCK , TERRORIZING THE PEOPLE . WITNESSES DESCRIBED THEM AS PRIMITIVE-LOOKING MEN WITH RED-PIERCING EYES . BECAME KNOWN AS THE " MOTH MEN . " I 'VE GOT AN X-FILE DATING BACK TO 1952 ON IT . WHAT WOULD THAT BE FILED NEXT TO ? " THE COCKROACH THAT ATE CINCINNATI " ? THE COCKROACH THAT ATE CINCINNATI IS IN THE " C 's . " MOTH MEN 'S OVER IN THE " M 's . " THIS ISN 'T THE WAY . WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? MICHELLE ALWAYS MARKS HER ROUTE WITH LITTLE WHITE STONES . THIS IS THE SAME PATH . THIS IS THE WAY WE CAME . I HAVEN 'T SEEN ONE OF HER STONES FOR 20 MINUTES . THAT 'S BECAUSE YOU 'VE HAD YOUR NOSE GLUED TO THAT SCREEN THE WHOLE TIME . I 'M TELLING YOU , WE 'RE ON THE WRONG TRAIL . SOMEHOW WE GOT OFF TRACK . OH , MAN , THIS IS NOT HAPPENING . THIS IS NOT HAPPENING . EVERYBODY STAND STILL . THERE 'S SOMETHING OUT THERE . WHERE ? ABOUT 40 OR 50 YARDS OUT . JEFF ? NOTHING . I SAW IT . THE WOODS HAVE GONE SILENT AGAIN . [ Rustling ] I GOT IT ! I GOT IT ON MY SCREEN . WHERE ? WHERE ! ABOUT 30 YARDS AHEAD . IT 'S JUST SITTING THERE . WHAT IS HE DOING ? [ Scully ] TALK TO HIM . THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA . TALK TO HIM , JEFF ! GO TO YOUR RIGHT . IT JUST DISAPPEARED . [ Scully ] MULDER , IT 'S NOT ON THE SCREEN . [ Mulder ] SCULLY , I LOST IT . [ Scully ] I GOT IT ! - DID YOU HIT IT ? - I DON 'T KNOW . IT JUST STOPPED . WHERE 'S GLASER ? - HOW MANY SHOTS DID YOU FIRE ? - SIX , MAYBE SEVEN . THAT YOUR ONLY CLIP ? YEP . DON 'T FIRE AGAIN UNLESS YOU 'RE SURE YOU 'RE GONNA HIT IT . IT MAY BE TRYING TO SPEND OUR ADVANTAGE . WHAT THE HELL IS IT , MULDER ? I DON 'T KNOW . BUT WHATEVER IT IS , IT 'S SMARTER THAN US . AT LEAST OUT HERE . - [ Gasps ] - MULDER ? MULDER ! SCULLY ! SCULLY ! MULDER ? SCULLY ! YOU OKAY ? YOU WERE AN INDIAN GUIDE . HELP ME OUT HERE . INDIAN GUIDE SAYS MAYBE YOU SHOULD RUN TO THE STORE AND GET SOME MATCHES . I WOULD , BUT I LEFT MY WALLET IN THE CAR . WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? TRYING TO OPEN MY GUN . IF I CAN SEPARATE THE SHELL FROM THE CASING , MAYBE I CAN GET THE POWDER TO IGNITE . AND MAYBE IT 'LL START RAINING WEENIES AND MARSHMALLOWS . DO I DETECT A HINT OF NEGATIVITY ? NO ! YES , ACTUALLY . YEAH . MULDER , YOU NEED TO KEEP WARM . YOUR BODY 'S STILL IN SHOCK . I WAS TOLD ONCE THAT THE BEST WAY TO REGENERATE BODY HEAT ... IS TO CRAWL NAKED INTO A SLEEPING BAG WITH SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WAS ALREADY NAKED . MAYBE IF IT RAINED SLEEPING BAGS , YOU 'LL GET LUCKY . YOU EVER THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ABOUT DYING ? ONCE WHEN I WAS AT THE ICE CAPADES . WHEN I WAS FIGHTING MY CANCER , I WAS ANGRY AT THE INJUSTICE OF IT ... AND ITS MEANINGLESSNESS . THEN I REALIZED THAT THAT WAS A STRUGGLE- - TO GIVE IT MEANING ... TO MAKE SENSE OF IT . IT 'S LIKE LIFE . I THINK NATURE IS SUPREMELY INDIFFERENT TO WHETHER WE LIVE OR DIE . I MEAN , IF YOU 'RE LUCKY YOU GET 75 YEARS , IF YOU 'RE REALLY LUCKY YOU GET 80 . IF YOU 'RE EXTRAORDINARILY LUCKY , YOU GET 50 OF THOSE YEARS WITH A DECENT HEAD OF HAIR . I GUESS IT IS LIKE LAS VEGAS . THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS . OH ! dd TA-DA dddd GO , GIRL . [ Mulder ] HEY , WHO DID YOU IDENTIFY WITH WHEN YOU WERE A KID- - WILMA OR BETTY ? I IDENTIFIED WITH BETTY 'S BUSTLINE . YES ! I DID TOO . I COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO BARNEY , THOUGH . THE KIDS WERE CUTE . YEAH , BUT WHERE ARE THEY TODAY ? " MOTH MEN " ? REALLY ? YEAH . BUT THERE SEEM TO BE ONLY TWO OF ' EM . I DON 'T WANNA WRESTLE . GET OVER HERE . I 'M GONNA TRY AND KEEP YOU WARM . SORRY . ONE OF US HAS GOT TO STAY AWAKE , SCULLY . YOU SLEEP , MULDER . IF YOU GET TIRED , YOU WAKE ME . I 'M NOT GONNA GET TIRED . WHY DON 'T YOU SING SOMETHING ? NO , MULDER . IF YOU SING SOMETHING , I 'LL KNOW YOU 'RE AWAKE . YOU DON 'T WANT ME TO SING . I CAN 'T CARRY A TUNE . IT DOESN 'T MATTER . JUST SING ANYTHING . d dd JEREMIAH WAS A BULLFROG d dd WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE dd dd NEVER UNDERSTOOD A SINGLE WORD HE SAID dd dd BUT I HELPED HIM DRINK HIS WINE dd CHORUS . dd JOY ... TO THE WORLD dd dd ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS dd d dd JOY TO THE FISHES IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA d d dd JOY TO YOU AND ME ddd SCULLY ? HERE . OVER HERE ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? LOOKING FOR FOOD . I FOUND SOME WILD BERRIES . I WOULDN 'T GO FAR . MULDER , YOU NEVER LEFT MY SIGHT . [ Groan ] SCULLY ? SCULLY ? SCULLY ? SCULLY ! DOWN HERE ! WHERE ? I FELL DOWN A HOLE . [ Coughing ] YOU ALL RIGHT ? YEAH . I LANDED ON SOFT DIRT . KIND OF . WHAT 'S DOWN THERE ? I DON 'T KNOW . IT 'S PRETTY DARK . [ Gasps ] SCULLY , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? YOU OKAY ? - I FOUND MICHELLE . - IS SHE ALIVE ? NOT FOR MUCH LONGER . MULDER , WE HAVE TO GET HER OUT OF HERE . - IS THERE A WAY OUT ? - I DON 'T KNOW . I- - I 'M IN SOME KIND OF A CHAMBER . THERE 'S- - IT 'S LIKE ... SOME KIND OF NETWORK . - MULDER ? - YEAH ? I 'M NOT ALONE . I DON 'T HAVE MY WEAPON ! MULDER ! HOLD ON . I 'M GONNA DROP MY GUN DOWN . [ Rustling ] - OW ! - JESUS ! - MULDER , ARE YOU OKAY ? - DON 'T MIND ME . SCULLY ! MULDER , LOOK . THERE HAS TO BE A SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR THIS . [ Groaning ] TOO BAD WE DON 'T HAVE ANY OFFICE FURNITURE . IF THEY COULD SEE US NOW . GO , TEAM . A HUNDRED MORE BODIES AND WE 'LL WIN THE HONEYBAKED HAM . [ Man ] AGENT MULDER ! WE 'RE DOWN HERE ! WE 'RE DOWN HERE ! WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE ? WE 'VE GOT INJURED PEOPLE DOWN HERE . WE NEED A LADDER . RIGHT AWAY . HEY , OVER HERE . [ Siren Wailing ] DAD 'S GONNA BE OKAY . IT 'S GONNA BE OKAY . IT 'S GONNA BE FINE . I 'M JUST GONNA SAY GOOD-BYE . [ Siren Wailing ] WELL , WE JUST GOT ALL THE THANKS WHEN YOU DID ALL THE WORK . ON THE CONTRARY , AGENT KINSLEY . WE WOULD 'VE NEVER GOTTEN INVOLVED IN THIS IF NOT FOR YOU . REALLY ? YEAH . YOU SEE THIS ? YEAH , I POINTED THAT OUT TO AGENT STONECYPHER ON THE DRIVE DOWN . THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE CAVE THAT SCULLY FELL INTO , AN INSCRIPTION . " AD NOCTUM . " THAT 'S LATIN . YEAH . IT MEANS , " INTO DARKNESS . " THE SPANISH CONQUISTADORS USED TO CARVE IT ON THE POST ... THAT THEY WOULD LASH THE NATIVES TO AS A WARNING . SO , WHO ARE YOU SAYING WROTE THIS ? PONCE de LEON CAME HERE 450 YEARS AGO LOOKING FOR THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH . YOU MEAN , YOU THINK THAT THAT BODY , THE ONE THAT AGENT SCULLY SHOT- - NO . AFTER 400 YEARS IN THE WOODS , DON 'T YOU THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE ADAPTED PERFECTLY TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT ? YOU 'RE MAKING THIS UP . WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ? 'CAUSE YOU WORK ON THE X-FILES AND YOU JUST WANT TO WRITE OFF YOUR MOTEL . SEARCH AND RESCUE ARE STILL UNABLE TO FIND JEFF GLASER ... OR THE SECOND PREDATOR THAT YOU REPORTED . I WOULDN 'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY COULDN 'T FIND EITHER ONE OF THEM . AGENT MULDER , I 'M CONFUSED . WHY WOULD THEY COME AFTER THE BOY IN THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT ? THESE PREDATORS HAVE BEEN IN THESE WOODS FOR A LONG , LONG TIME . THEY WOULD 'VE PERCEIVED ANY ENCROACHMENT ON THEIR TERRITORY AS AN ENEMY , EVEN A LITTLE KID LIKE THAT . BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY 'D COME AFTER ANY ONE OF US ... THAT HAD GONE INTO THE WOODS , WOULDN 'T IT ? WHERE 'S AGENT SCULLY ? SHE GOT A LIFT BACK TO THE MOTEL TO PACK UP BOTH YOUR THINGS . SHE DID ? EXCUSE ME . MY JACKET 'S IN THAT CAR . SCULLY ! SCULLY ! MULDER , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? LET 'S GET OUTTA HERE . OKAY . YOU PACK EVERYTHING ? YEAH . [ Child ] I MADE THIS !

Who is going to see a performer looks like this ? Unless she can fix me , I am dead with school . Tricia , I 'm sorry , but there 's nothing I can do . The nerve damage is irreparable . What did I do ? What did I do to deserve this ? You don 't know what it 's like being left out . Knowing people point you like you are a freak ? I know what it 's like to be at the outside . And I know that I am stronger because of it . I don 't want to be stronger . I just want to be who I am . I just , want to be who I am again . She is gone . Forever . Her gift isn 't . I look around your room and I see all the things your passionate about and I know that your face is just a small part of who you are . Only you hold the key to your future . I know that the life is a weird journey . But to live it , you have to be out there . Hello , doctor . How is my baby ? Making progress . I hope . This arrived . Oh , could you open that please ? My arthritis is just not getting me down today . All gifts from the mystery friend . Tess , did all the gifts have the same postmark ? All from the Santa Barbara . - Mr. Hoffman . - Dr. Clay . I am sorry about the urgency of this meeting . But Dr. Brant was avid that this will be dealt immediately . Well , You know your phone call was a little vague . Is there a problem ? Someone has the information about Tricia Holmes . I am not here to pass the blame or to play games . Dr. Brant wants you clear that if you don 't cooperate , all this can go away . I don 't remember every patients . It is a good answer , for the medical board . Medical board ? Um , they 're starting an investigation . I didn 't tell anyone I swear . We need a statement that you signed nothing unusual that night . That will give the board off our backs . And Tricia Holmes , She can go back and hide her disfigured face in the shadows , while you and Dr. Brant enjoy all of these . Do we have a deal ? No . No ? I won 't lie for her any more . It 's two a.m. when Tricia Holmes was brought back ... Dr. Eubanks ... did an excellent job on her . She was resting in calm . Everything was calm . Then Dr. Brant came in . She was freaked . She was in the middle of chin implant on some movie star , and the bone grafts needed for the procedure had been damaged . Brant needed a donor , she needed one quick . She checked out Tricia 's chart . Without a blinking , she grabed the scalpel . My God , she didn 't even bring that poor girl back in the surgery . She reopened Tricia 's face and she harvested the bone and put it into a movie star client . In a haste , she severed Tricia 's facial nerve . Brant gave me the promotion to keep quiet . I 've been trapped , ever since . Ask Tricia Holmes about feeling trapped . Long day , Bridget . You know they say : woman 's working all that . You looked tired . But then I guess stalking can be tough on the young thing . The late nights , the long hours . You know you Americans have a whole other English . Sorry love , don 't follow . Now that my father is back . You 'd never get approval . So there must be independent move . You shot Broots , did 't you ? If I shot Broots , he would be dead . Now scaring him was the intention . So who ordered it ? Your guess is as good as mine . Raines . It 's just his style . It 'll make sense to go after the weakest link . It was a very tough code . Get something straight . Broots may be an idiot , but he is my idiot . The only one who terrorizes him , it is me . You put a gun on me , no big deal . Cos I know you don 't have the rocks to put the trigger , but the next time you miss with one of my team , I 'll put a bullet right on your blonde bonnet . They said you weren 't a bitch . They were being kind . For what it worth , I did shoot at Mr. Broots . However I 've never took the pictures . What 's the occasion , Jarod ? Oh , let 's just say it 's my little way of saying thank you for giving me the best job that money can 't buy . Well , you are the best hire I 've ever made . No offence . You 've been rolling those charity cases at our record pace . Give the rest of us opportunities to focus on other priorities . Like weekends ... , ... the beachhouse renovations . Guilty . Are you okay , Christine ? Ah , just um ... I haven 't , haven 't eaten . Oh , I think you had one too many If Wade would be so kind to lent me his car , I will give you a ride home . A chauffeur , too ? I really did hire the right guy . What kind of champagne was that ? A very special year . If you 're keeping the engine like that , you gonna ruin it . Eubanks says his car can do one hundred and forty . Let 's see if he 's telling the truth . Jarod , Jarod , Jarod ! Dr. Brant ? Dr. Brant ? Can you hear me ? There 's been a terrible accident . Am I okay ? Just a liitle blood . - Oh God . - No , no , no . Never mind that . There is no deep trauma . It 's only cosmetic . My face ? Is it bad ? Don 't worry . The damage isn 't severe . I can repair you . Thank God . There 's been one slight complication , however . Complication , what ... Oh , we have a high profile client to the next operating room . A super model . She had terrible reaction to a chemical peel . She needs massive skin grafts . Luckily , we have the perfect donor . You . Me ? I am not donating grafts . It would ruin my face . I am sorry . But , there is no other way . What , you are insane ? You cannot do that to me ! Sure I can . Just like you did to Tricia Holmes . Look on the bright side . At least I am going tell you that I 'm going to harvest part of your body for someone else . That was what you did to her , isn 't it ? Jarod , please . You cut a piece of her jaw , to save your important client 's little chin implant . And you severed her facial nerve in your haste , didn 't you ? Yes , I did that ! Now please let me go ! Sorry . I cannot do that . But I promise , I 'll try to be more careful with you , than you were with her . No , no , no , Jarod , please . Oh , try not panic . Your face is still anaesthetized . What 's left of it . You are insane . No , I resent that , doctor . I did the very best I could , considering I am not really a plastic surgeon . What a ... No , no . Oops . " Doctor Arrested In Cosmetic Surgery Malpractice " I don 't think she is coming . You need to have more faith . Oh , baby . You look beautiful . Thanks . Can I give you a ride ? Thanks , but , life is a so weird journey . and it 's about time I get back out there . Jarod , Jarod . This is what you look like . This is who you are . Bridget did the shooting , but she is not the photographer . We know . This is came this morning . What the hell is going on here ? Someone is trying to terrorize us . Who ? Well , we are working on that one . Angelo ? Angry . Feel confused . Angry . Angelo . Who is angry ? Who ? Angelo . This is a waste of time . I decide who lives or dies . I decide who lives or dies .

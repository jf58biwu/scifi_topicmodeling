 Game ! Why don 't we make it interesting this time ? Let 's add some table stakes . What kind of stakes ? I don 't know . Mmm ... a couple of replicator rations , maybe ? Don 't do it , Harry . He 's hustling you . Wait a minute . Are you saying he deliberately let me win ? That would be dishonest , Harry . I won that game ... and I 'll beat you again . How many rations are you willing to bet on that ? Come on , Harry . Go for it . A week 's worth . Harry , Harry , Harry . Never , ever play with anyone ... not even your best friend ... if he says , " Let 's make it interesting . " Now , you want a little action ? I 'll give you a little action . How about an honest game of chance ? Never play with anyone ... even your best friend ... if he offers you " an honest game of chance , " Harry . One replicator ration is all it takes to play and the only thing you have to do to win is pick a number . Just predict what the radiogenic particle count will be at 1200 hours tomorrow , and if you hit , the pot is yours ... minus a small handling fee for the bank , of course . I 'll take a piece of that . Harry , get a padd . Take down these names and numbers . I 'm in , too . Lewis ... 2100 . I 'll back that bet up . Rogers ... Ensign Hogan , still no luck with the warp drive ? No , Lieutenant . The manifold just won 't fire up . We 've finally narrowed it down to some kind of a problem in EPS Conduit 141 . Was there any indication yesterday that there was something wrong ? Suder was monitoring the EPS flow in the CCF . He says everything was fine . Well , I guess we 'll just have to get in there and track it down . Happy Kal Rekk , Mr. Vulcan . The holiday of Kal Rekk is not for two weeks . But it 's the Kal Rekk season . There is no Kal Rekk season . Kal Rekk is a day of atonement , solitude and silence . Atonement . Solitude . All your Vulcan holidays are the same . I 've been doing some research . I know . Why would you need to do research on Vulcan holidays ? It 's part of my job as morale officer . Morale is irrelevant to a Vulcan . Oh , please ! There 's no one on this ship requires my services more than you do . I will not rest until I see you smile . Then you will not rest . I don 't suppose you 've ever heard of the Vulcan Rumarie ? The Rumarie is an ancient pagan festival . Full of barely clothed Vulcan men and women , covered in slippery Rillan grease , chasing one another . That has not been observed for a millennium . Well , it 's time to bring it back . Lieutenant Tuvok , report to Engineering immediately . Acknowledged . I 've been thinking of a Rumarie theme for the Mess Hall next week ... lots of high-fat , greasy foods , and if people want to take off their clothes and chase one another ... well , it certainly wouldn 't hurt morale around here . Is there a problem , Lieutenant ? 98 percent of his body suffered third-degree plasma burns . If the circuit hadn 't failed , he would have been vaporized . It appeared that Mr. Darwin had entered the conduit to repair a faulty circuit when the accident occurred . A perfectly good theory . Unfortunately , it 's wrong . This contusion is the result of a hard blow to the back of the skull . Perhaps he fell and hit his head in the conduit . The coup-contrecoup pattern of breakage should tell us whether the blow is a result of a moving head hitting a stationary object or a moving object hitting a stationary head . In this case , the pattern clearly indicates the latter . I 'm sorry to report Crewman Darwin was murdered . At first glance , there is no obvious motive . Crewman Darwin didn 't have any known enemies on board . I 've been looking over his Starfleet record . His training instructor recommended him as an officer 's candidate . He turned it down to come with us . He has three sisters back home . Sorry I 'm late . These are the duty logs from last night . Lon Suder was the only one in Engineering when Frank Darwin came on duty . Something wrong ? No , not really . I 've just never been comfortable with Suder . That 's all . It 's not like he ever did anything wrong , it 's just ... As a Maquis , he did what he had to do a little too well . As in ? As in killing Cardassians . I don 't recall observing anything unusual about Mr. Suder 's behavior while I was on your ship . You weren 't with him in battle . Around us , he was the quietest most unassuming guy you 'll ever meet . Typical Betazoid . Kept to himself . I never knew much about him . In the Maquis , we didn 't ask for resumes . We needed all the help we could get . A lot us were doing what we were doing to protect our families , but Suder had his own reasons . I wish I could tell you what they were . In combat , there was something in his eyes . Maybe he had something personal against Cardassians . Sometimes I had to pull him back ... stop him from going too far . And once or twice when I did , he looked at me with those cold eyes and I just knew , he was this far away from killing me . I find it curious that none of this was included in your initial crew evaluation , Commander . I don 't put down hunches or bad feelings in my crew evaluations , Lieutenant . A Vulcan should appreciate that . Considering the fact that your Maquis crew included malcontents , outlaws and mercenaries , I believe it would have been appropriate . I wasn 't going to make it harder for any of them here . Suder did his job when he was serving with me and he 's done his job since he 's been on this ship . It seems clear where your investigation should begin , Lieutenant . You wish to see me , Mr. Tuvok ? Sit down . You were alone in Engineering when Crewman Darwin reported for duty last night . Yes , sir . Did you speak to him ? No , we just sort of looked at each other and he did whatever he had to do and I did what I had to do . And what was that ? I was , um , running a fuel-consumption analysis for Lieutenant Torres . She can tell you . Are you accusing me of killing him ? I have accused no one at this time . Did you kill Crewman Darwin ? No . No , I barely knew him . You know , just because I 'm a Maquis doesn 't make me a killer . I 'll be speaking to everyone in Engineering ... perhaps everyone on this ship ... not just former members of the Maquis . We all know how you feel about the Maquis . I assure you , I have no feelings about the Maquis . No , you just spied on us and were going to turn us all over to Starfleet . As hard as it may be for you to understand , that did not require any feelings on my part . The Doctor places the time of death at 2214 . Do you remember what you were doing then ? I was still running the fuel analysis . I worked on it until I went off duty . Would you be surprised to know that your console was logged off at 2209 ? That 's not possible . Do you have a criminal record , Mr. Suder ? Now , that would be sort of difficult to check on , wouldn 't it ? Why would you have any reason to lie ? I don 't . Do you have a criminal record ? No . How would you describe your relationship with Crewman Darwin ? I had no relationship . No disagreements ? No . No fights ? No . No reason to kill him ? No . You 're dismissed , Crewman . I may have more questions for you later . Med Lab to Lieutenant Tuvok . Go ahead , Doctor . I think I 've found something that will help you . Do you see the DNA strands on the lower border ? Yes . They were retrieved from inside the head wound by nanites that I designed to recognize unusual DNA patterns . This DNA was isolated because it didn 't belong to the victim . Have you matched it to a member of the crew ? Are you certain ? DNA doesn 't know how to lie , Lieutenant . I must advise you that under Starfleet Directive 101 , you do not have to answer any questions . No . No , there 's no point in denying it anymore . Uh ... I used a two-kilo coil spanner . He was sitting at the impulse system control panel . Didn 't even look up when I moved in behind him and I swung the spanner as hard as I could . Crewman , I suggest you speak to counsel . There was practically no blood . I was surprised at that . I figured that the EPS conduit was the easiest way to dispose of the body , but ... I must have damaged one of the circuits when I put him inside . Oh . I hid the spanner behind a com line access panel on Deck 7 . Why did you kill him , Mr. Suder ? No reason . That is not a satisfactory answer . You must have had some motive . I didn 't like the way he looked at me . No doubt about it . This is the murder weapon . Mr. Suder is apparently telling the truth . You don 't seem satisfied , Lieutenant . No . You have a confession and the murder weapon . And no established motive . Does it matter ? A crime must have a logical purpose . Ah , yes , I see ... how to close the case without understanding the logic of the crime . For a Vulcan that would be a dilemma , wouldn 't it ? Doctor , is it possible that Mr. Suder is psychotic ? I doubt it . Kes , call up his genetic profile . The neuro-genetic markers are normal . There 's no tendency toward bipolar disorder . So he 's not insane , per se . What do the elevated norepinephrine levels suggest ? Aggressive , even violent tendencies . Why didn 't you report this immediately after your examination , Doctor ? These readings are not significantly different from those of the other Maquis crewmen . Obviously , it takes a certain personality type to be attracted to the life of an outlaw . Don 't you believe his confession , Tuvok ? In fact , I do . Nevertheless , my job is not finished until I determine a motive . And what if there was no motive ? One may not recognize the motivation , but there is always motivation . I think you are trapped in your own Vulcan logic , Lieutenant . All of us have violent instincts . We have evolved from predators . Well , not me , of course . I 've just been programmed by you predators . The question is , in a civilized world , can we suppress those instincts ? Most of the time , we can . Vulcans certainly can . You 've got your violent feelings buried underneath centuries of control , but the rest of the humanoid races aren 't always so skilled at self-discipline . Crewman Suder may have violent impulses that he just can 't control . Do you believe that a look by Mr. Darwin could provoke such a violent reaction ? It has been known to happen . I do not accept that explanation . I already told you why I killed him , Lieutenant . You didn 't like the way he looked at you . Right . Just how did he look at you ? Like a lot of people in Starfleet do . So this murder could in fact be explained as an outburst of rage against Starfleet . Look , if that 's how you want to look at this ... I want the truth . I don 't like Starfleet . I won 't deny that . But ... Yes ? I have killed people who weren 't in Starfleet for the same reason ... I did not like the way they looked at me . I 've thought about killing you , Lieutenant . In my case , you have a motive ... my previous mission as a spy , my role as your accuser ... but to my knowledge , Crewman Darwin had done nothing to you . That 's true . Then why choose him as a victim ? I don 't know . Do you feel remorse ? I don 't seem to feel anything at all . Most Betazoids can sense other people 's emotions ... I can 't even sense my own . So what 's going to happen to me now ? I 'll have to discuss that with the Captain . I know what I 'd do if I were her . Guess I 'm lucky . The Federation doesn 't execute people . It is important that I understand why you killed Mr. Darwin . I wish I could help you , Lieutenant . You can ... and indirectly , I may be able to help you , as well . Do you know what a mind-meld is ? It 's that ... Vulcan thing where you grab someone 's head . We would be telepathically linked ... exchanging our thoughts ... in essence , becoming one mind . One mind ? You and me ? I wouldn 't recommend that , Lieutenant . It is not without risk , but as a Vulcan , I have internal processes that allow me to control violent instincts . I believe I will be able to suppress whatever feelings I draw from you . And how will I be helped by all this ? It is likely that you will gain , at least for a time , some of my self-discipline to better control your own violent nature . What do I have to do ? Release the force field . My mind to your mind ... your thoughts to my thoughts ... Radiogenic particle density at the measured coordinates was 1873 per cubic meter . And the winner of 16 replicator rations in the Paris radiogenic sweepstakes is ... - Shh . - Shh . Computer ? There is no winner today . What ? No winner ? Computer , are you positive ? Try your luck again . Tomorrow you could be a winner . Very funny . You heard the little lady . Try your luck again , folks . The pot grows daily until we have a winner . Enter your name on the padd and pick a number . Can I buy you lunch , Mr. Kim ? I have an extra ration today . Two , by my count . Ten percent of the day 's action . The only one who wins every day is you . I think I 'll have some prime rib ... medium rare ... mashed potatoes , creamed spinach . And maybe some Yorkshire pudding ... and a raktajino with whipped cream on top . ... so it ultimately turned out to be a worthwhile and enlightening experience . Did you get any of the answers you were after ? It is difficult for me to accept , Captain , but Mr. Suder was telling the truth as he knew it . He is a man with an incredibly violent nature , living in an environment without any outlet to express it . I am surprised he was able to maintain his self-control for as long as he did . I guess in his earlier life , he always found ways to release those impulses ... like volunteering for the Maquis . What do we do with him ? If we were home , he 'd be sent to prison . The brig is the closest thing we have , but I don 't think we can just leave him down in our dungeon for the rest of the trip . Nor would it be appropriate to leave him in the custody of someone in this Quadrant . I agree . Captain ... he is prepared to die for his crime . An execution ? You 're not seriously suggesting that we ... I only mention it because of the extenuating circumstances and because he feels it would be an appropriate punishment . I don 't . I prefer to rehabilitate him , not to end his life . We 'll confine him to quarters . Work with Kim to install maximum-security containment . Pardon me , Captain , but allowing him the comfort of his own quarters doesn 't seem an appropriate punishment for murder . If we don 't get home soon , he 'll be in that room a long time , Mr. Tuvok . I think this is the best we can do under these circumstances . Crewman Darwin 's three sisters might not agree . How is Suder since the mind-meld ? Quite calm and controlled . Clearly , the meld initiated some high cortical activity in his brain . And you , Tuvok , any adverse effects ? I will admit that I am more disconcerted than I anticipated . Why don 't you take a day or two off for meditation ? Thank you , but I am already taking steps to purge these residual feelings . I don 't believe time off will be necessary . I will , of course , advise you of any further complications . Tuvok . Take care of yourself . I would prefer to be alone . Okay . All right . Far be it from me to bother anyone . If you really want me to leave , I 'll leave . I really want you to leave . I don 't believe you . Your voice says " go away , " but your heart wants me to make you smile . Please , go away . Come on ... a little smile . How is it going to hurt ? I won 't tell anyone . What must I do to convince you to stop ? Come on . Just a little , itty-bitty smile . Just let the mouth curl a little there . That 's ... There 's an old Talaxian song my mother used to sing me as a child . I 'm going to sing it to you every day from now on . It goes ... Mr. Vulcan , I ... Oh , I can 't breath ... Can 't ... I can 't breath ... I 'm sorry if I ... Computer , end holodeck program . Particle density at the measured coordinates was 1415 per cubic meter . And the winner is ? Computer ? Computer ? There won 't be any more winners . Oh , come on , Chakotay . We were just having a little fun . The recreational facilities of the Delta Quadrant being what they are . I 've heard you 're responsible for this , Lieutenant . I didn 't think Starfleet would have a problem with it . With a senior officer running a gambling operation and skimming profits from each day 's proceeds ? Now , why would Starfleet have a problem with that ? Since you all seem to have extra replicator rations , you won 't be needing these . Today 's pot is hereby confiscated . The Captain 's put a lot of faith in you , Mr. Paris . She 'll be disappointed . You 're on report . Now , there 's a tough job ... filling out reports . But somebody 's got to do it . Thanks a lot . I did not hear you come in , Lieutenant . How are you feeling ? Centered . Don 't be misled . Your violent instincts still exist . You are simply suppressing them as Vulcans do . I can feel the difference . It is almost as if I can observe the violence inside me without letting it get too close . It is quite remarkable what you Vulcans have learned to do . Understand that this will not be a permanent change , unless you commit to a strict daily regime of meditation and mental exercise . I also believe that a series of holodeck programs designed to allow your violent tendencies to be released in a safe environment may help to purge your aggressive impulses . Holographic violence does not give the same ... sensation as the real thing . I 've tried it . Has anyone ever suggested targeted neuro-synaptic therapy ? That didn 't work either . Our Doctor is programmed with the medical knowledge of every Federation world . Perhaps he 'll know of some treatment you haven 't tried . Since the meld , I feel capable of controlling myself . Perhaps with your help , I can learn to stay this way . It must be difficult for you . Difficult ? Knowing violence as I 've known it . I have studied violence for over 100 years . Studying it and knowing it are two different things , aren 't they ? It 's attractive , isn 't it ? Attractive ? Violence . On the contrary . I find it disturbing . You 're right . It is disturbing ... never knowing when that impulse may come , or whether or not you can control it when it does . You live on the edge of every moment and yet , in its own way , violence is attractive , too . Maybe because it doesn 't require logic . Perhaps that 's why it 's so liberating . Ironic , isn 't it ... that I can share with you , of all people , what I have hidden from everyone all my life . Can we do it again , Tuvok ? Again ? Meld . That would not be advisable . I understand . Really , I do . I have thought about it a lot . In a way , a mind-meld is almost an act of violence , isn 't it ? I don 't understand why you would ... Penetration . Your will dissolving mine . The joining . It seems to me that a mind-meld might be fatal if you lost control . Computer , place level-1 security seals on this room . Acknowledged . Security seals in place . Delete security clearance : Tuvok-one-four-nine-four-lambda . Specified security clearance deleted . Please inform the Captain that I am no longer fit for duty . Acknowledged . Computer , lift the security seal from Lieutenant Tuvok 's quarters . Wait here . I would advise you not to enter , Captain . Tuvok . Please , do not come any closer . Talk to me . I said ... don 't come any closer . We need to get you to Sick Bay . It would be safer for the crew if I were to remain in these quarters . I remind you , I am trained in the martial arts of many Alpha Quadrant cultures . Sitting here , attempting to meditate , I have counted the number of ways I know of killing someone using just a finger , a hand ... a foot ... I had reached 94 when you entered . The Doctor is fully versed in Vulcan medicine . Again , for safety reasons , I recommend you sedate me before you initiate transport . Levels of neuropeptides in the limbic system are down 15 percent . There 's a definite neuro-chemical imbalance in the mesiofrontal cortex . Which means what ? That 's where the Vulcan psycho-suppression systems are located . This may be the result of a incompatibility with the Betazoid telepathic neural center . I 'm not sure . Vulcan mind-melds ... utter foolishness . Anybody with an ounce of sense wouldn 't share his brain with someone else . Would you ? I certainly wouldn 't . And of course , when something goes wrong ... and believe me , it does more often than they 'd like to admit ... the first thing they call out is , " Doctor ? " Can you help him ? I wish I could tell you . There 's a recommended course of treatments that should begin immediately . What does it involve ? First , we have to take away his ability to control his violence . We do this in short bursts over a period of time and hope it provides a shock to his system . If it works , his own neural controls will take over again . I believe we 're about ready . Revive him . Something has changed . We 've temporarily removed all of your emotional suppression abilities , Lieutenant . How do you feel ? I ... feel . Tuvok , do you know where you are ? Of course I know where I am , Captain . I 'm just not sure I know ... who I am . Try to relax . The treatment still has about three minutes to go . Oh , it must be working because I feel very strong . Very ... powerful . Quite euphoric . This must be how my ancestors felt . Doctor , would you consider allowing me to remain this way for a while ? It would be a valuable opportunity for me to study primal Vulcan behavior . Sorry , I 'm not prepared to do that . The course of treatment is very specific . You are not invulnerable , hologram . A few well-chosen commands to the computer , and you will cease to exist . Two minutes , 30 seconds left . You look shocked , Captain . You must be asking yourself , " What if this doesn 't work ? What do we do then ? " I have an idea . I 'll just stay in my quarters for the rest of the trip . I 'll just relax and read , eat the ship 's food , use the ship 's energy , all in the comforts of my own room . Why , even Mr. Suder and I could get together for a few hands of Cardassian pinochle once or twice a week . That is how we treat violent offenders on this ship , isn 't it ? You are not a violent offender , Tuvok . I could be . Just like Suder . You know , Captain , I don 't mind telling you something the other Tuvok never would . You are wrong . Sparing Suder 's life is a sign of weakness . You disgust me . All you humans do . Admit it . Part of you feels as I do . Part of you wants him to die for what he did . No part of me feels that way . Liar ! He has killed and you know he deserves to die ! On behalf of the victim 's family , Captain , I beg you to reconsider . Give them the satisfaction of his execution . I have a radical suggestion , Captain . Release the force field ... and I 'll kill him for you . Release the force field . My student ... my protégé ... there is so much to learn for each of us today , isn 't there ? You 'll be all right , Tuvok . This 'll be over in 30 seconds . Listen to what I tell you . Release the force field . I 'm sorry . I had them disable your telepathic abilities , too . You can 't reach me , Tuvok . Release the force field ! Ten seconds . Five seconds . It 's over . He 's lost consciousness . He might be able to fool the sensors . Sedate him again . Computer , remove the force field . Help me get him back on the bed . How many treatments do you think will be necessary ? I wish I knew , Captain . In a sense , Mr. Tuvok 's mind is fighting a classic battle between good and evil . The battle may be won in a day , a year ... or it may never be won . Tuvok ? I wondered what happened to you . They wouldn 't tell me anything . There were some complications from the meld . I wondered about that . I 've been undergoing neuro-synaptic therapy in Sick Bay . It didn 't work . No . Have you come to kill me ? To execute you for your crime . To execute me ? I see . And calling it that makes it more comfortable for you . I will take no comfort in this . A most logical use of violence ... to punish the violent . We both know that I am prepared to die , but are you prepared to kill ? It needs to be done . To release your violent impulses ? To serve justice . Justice or vengeance ? Understand one thing , Tuvok . I can promise you this will not silence your demons . If you can 't control the violence , the violence controls you . Be prepared to yield your entire being to it , to sacrifice your place in civilized life , for you will no longer be a part of it and there 's no return . I ... seek ... no return . Of course . You would not be able to live with yourself . Then we are both to die , and that will end the torment . My mind ... to your mind . My thoughts ... to your thoughts . My mind ... to your mind . My thoughts to your thoughts . Crewman Suder to the Bridge . Suder , what are you doing with a combadge ? You better get down here , Chakotay . Lieutenant Tuvok needs help . Captain 's Log , supplemental . Ensign Suder has been incarcerated in secured quarters where he will likely spend the rest of our journey home . Lieutenant Tuvok remains under observation in Sick Bay . It may be hard for you to believe , Lieutenant , but what happened is encouraging . Your inability to complete the act of murder shows your suppression systems are starting to function again . You 're on your way back to being normal . Although , I 'm not sure how the word " normal " applies to a species that suppresses all their emotions . Captain ... I must apologize for my inappropriate behavior . I 'm just glad we have you back , Mr. Tuvok . I was most ... insulting to you . Don 't worry about it . I 've been insulted before . I hope you understand that I have always had the greatest respect for you as a Captain and consider you ... a friend . That means a great deal to me . Enough said . Get some rest . Tuvok . No more mind-melds without my permission . Understood ?

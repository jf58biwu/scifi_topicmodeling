 I named my Kitty after the goddess persephone for the delightful pun . Get it ? " Purr-sephone . " [ laughing ] Sometimes , she likes to bring me dead mice to play with and I don 't want to hurt her feelings so , I do . [ sighs ] Thank you . [ sighs ] I order the mousse . S-s-so , how did your date go last night ? Kathy and the waiter hit it off . She included herself in the tip . She cheated on you during the date ? That actually happens ? With surprising regularity . I hate dating . You got kiss a lot of frogs before you find a princess . Why ? Where is that written ? Why can 't I just go right to the princess ? Because your princess was off shagging the help . [ both laugh ] I 'll get married someday , right ? Why I can 't I just meet my wife now so I can forget about all this dating garbage ? What about the thrill of the chase ? The joy of discovery ? - Romance ? - Waste of time . Some of us don 't have to play the field . Some of us already have our smart bombs targeted - on the Fortified Bunker of Love . - Am ... I the " Bunker " ? Yeah . There , I said it . Call me an old softy but that 's the way I really feel . What ? ! And that 's the way I really feel . Now that your zapper 's warmed up , I got a wish for you : show me the girl I 'll marry . Bring on the princess so I can kiss all these frogs good-bye . Here you go- - A bride-tracker . If your future bride is anywhere nearby this will point her out . - That thing is cool . - So , how 's this thing work ? Just point and click . But don 't get your hopes up . There are billions of people out there on this planet . Your wife could be thousands of miles away . Or on that stool over there . Wow . - I 'm marrying Barbara ... - Parker . Barbara Parker . Barbara Parker-Donnelly . That 's my wife . Hi . Hi . You 've , uh ... never seen a girl before . No , no . I 'm just savoring the moment . - Ah . - You might want to do the same . [ chuckles ] Oh , really ? And why might I want to do that ? Do you believe in predetermination ? - What ? - Think about it- - With all the billions of people in the world what are the odds of two people even meeting let alone falling in love ? I believe in a higher force . I believe in a beautiful thing called " Destiny . " And I believe that you 're sitting on my beeper . Thank you . WYATT : Okay . Okay , so explain this to me : all those villains in Gotham City- - What do they have , like , two policemen ? How come Batman has to do all the work ? Or we 're supposed to believe that a flock of sewer-dwelling Penguins raised Danny De Vito from birth and taught him english language ? Nah . Again , I have no explanation . Schwarzengger 's supposed to be in the next one . Ooh ! I 'm there . Do we think alike or do we think alike ? Get out of my head ! So , um ... What am I thinking now ? You 're thinking about us going out on Saturday . Friday , actually , but , uh , close enough . - Hmm ... - So , Saturday it is . - Our second date . - Second ? - What happened to first ? - Well , this is our first . Oh , you 're counting coffee . Well , first date , second date ... - Like it matters . - Oh , no . Oh , no , no , no , no . It definitely matters . I mean , we need to clearly define this . I mean , after all this date could be an anniversary someday . Well , it 's nice to see you don 't have any commitment issues . [ chuckles ] [ sighs ] God ! [ chuckling ] ANNOUNCER : ... Humberto Luna ! [ audience applauding and cheering ] So , is this the one where the fat guy rides his bicycle around the desk ? - Is there one where he doesn 't ? - I may have to walk away a mile to find a woman who appreciates the genius of canal cuarente y uno . You know , I 'm almost tempted to , uh ... Nah , it 'd be crazy . Ah ! I 'm going to give it a shot . OK ... OK , aqui es ... Ya quicieron que me estacionara . Will you get a load of this . Small world , huh ? - That 's impossible . - So , I 'm thinking : just wedding international beer buffet and one of those big fish molds . Babs said the cutest thing today . " Babs " ? ! Barbara is now " Babs " ? Maybe . I 'm trying out adorable nicknames . - What do you think of " BB " ? - Look , you can call her " BB . " And she can call you " YY " and you can call me " Bye-bye . " There is that single-guy bitterness again . You just don 't understand what it 's like to be married . Ah , but who does , Mr. Donnelly ? Understand marriage , that is . The Mystique of a divine union between two souls . The Erotic Superglue that binds a man ot his woman . Not that I 'm condoning the use of Superglue in marriage or suggesting that epoxy and foreplay mix . Perhaps you should take this conversation up with your father . Hey , guys . It 's this mustard . That 's not too spicy for you is it , lamb chop ? Promise me you 'll make it like this every day for the rest of our lives . Oh , yeah , yeah ... the rest of our lives . Awesome . Oh , do you think you could get me a glass for this ... brewski ? Don 't move a muscle . - Get a wish ? - He didn 't . When did you go screwy ? Chett tinkered with Wyatt 's bride-tracker so it 's points at me . He think I don 't know , the bonehead ! Why didn 't you just tell him you 're onto him ? If I did , I won 't be able to torture him . - Oh . - Oh . That was delicious , hon . Do you think you can make me another sandwich ? Uh ... sure . You bet . Hey-dee-ay. fiancee . My God ! What are you doing ? ! Nothing . Just took a shower . Since we 're engaged , there 's no reason to be shy . There 's nothing here you 're not going to be on a first-name basis with soon enough . Well , that 's true . I guess there 's no reason you can 't see me an naturel . Ooh , la , la ! I meant " without makeup . " Aah , you don 't have to wear makeup for me . Well , maybe a little light foundation . Only 37 more hours till date number two . It 's a very important milestone in a relationship , you know ? Ooh ! Ooh ! Look , look , look , there 's my Barbles . - " Barbles " ? - Just floating it out there . Huh , and , uh , what does they call her ? - Huh ? - You know , Trey- - the guy with tongue rammed in Barbles ' ear . [ giggling ] [ clearing throat ] I think you and me an explanation . I ... overslept . The dog ate it ... I was young , I needed the money . - What are we talking about ? - You were flirting with that guy . - I thought we had a date on Saturday . - Sorry . I guess I didn 't know we were exclusive . But you 're destined to be my wi ... wi ... wild girl ! [ growling ] Oh , well ... in that case , Saturday it is . [ meowing ] Walk away , my friend . Forget about " Barbles . " So she 's not exclusive . No big . I 'm safe in the arms of destiny . And she 's safe in the arm of Clyde Phillips . - And Jim . - Jim ? - And Dan . - Dan ? - Carl . - I don 't see Carl . Oh , he 's behind Ned . Oh , yeah . You have got to be kidding me . I have to train for our wedding night ? This is serious business , Mister . Genie loving requires a superhuman physical conditioning an off-the-chart ability to withstand pain and , of course , discipline . One slipup , and you 're dead flash-fried ! Vaporized ! Toast ! I am ... so turned on right now . Barbara is seeing other guys . Why ? Because she doesn 't know I 'm her husband . - To be . - She doesn 't know what a happy couple we are . - Will be . - I 'll show her how much fun married life can be . Ten years from now . No . No . Saturday . I 'm pulling out all the stops . We 're going to do every " fun couples " thing in the book . This book- - the guy is a genius . It 's a primer for married life . Does this mean I get to be your best man ? Slow down . It 's like ten years from now . [ humming ] [ window sliding open ] - Wyatt ? - Wow ! Now , there 's a bed-face I could wake up to every morning . Ready for date number two ? Wyatt , when I said 6 : 00 , I meant PM . Oh , it 's not early . That early . It 's a little early . I 'll come back in an hour . - Ready ? - Oh , yeah , I 'm ready . Bring it . Okay . [ screaming ] - Ready ? - Yeah . I 'm ready . - You okay ? - [ stammering ] Yeah ... I 'm fine . Missed me ! [ screaming ] - What are you doing ? - We 're sharing . That 's what couples do . Sharing 's fun . Here , have some of mine . - That 's fine , thank you . - Come on , eat off my plate . - It 's cute . - Really , Wyatt , I 'm fine . - Come on . - Wyatt ... - stop it . - You 're missing a real treat , hon . I really wish you wouldn 't call me " hon . " Did I do that ? This ... this just feels so comfortable . In fact , I feel like I could do anything around you . [ burps ] I 'm not asking for directions . - We 're not lost . - Because I 'm a guy . Guys don 't like asking for directions . We 're funny that way . I know that drives you girls crazy . Oh , I know that look . Somebody 's catching hell when we get home . So , what do you think ? Now , I know you girls love those frilly couches but I need to be comfortable when I 'm watching the game . Honey , bring me a beer ! What ? Why are we looking at couches ? We 're shopping . It 's a couple thing . Okay . I think I see the problem here . Wyatt ... we are not a couple . This is our first date . - This is our second date . - That was just coffee . It was a date ! Oh , our first fight . Oh , let 's , um ... let 's promise never ot go to bed angry . I can certainly promise you half of that . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! What 's wrong ? I got the rest of the day planned . I thought we 'd read the paper together change our answering machine message argue about money ! Wyatt ... It 's over . This was a really bad date . I will not by seeing you again . You mean we 're breaking up ? ! That 's what I 'm thinking . Wait ! Wait ! We can still save our marriage ! We can adopt ! A kid like this will remind us why we fell in love- - make us grow closer- - fill in the gaps in our lives ! Don 't you want to be his mommy ? [ giggling ] Before we begin , I want you to know that no human has ever been here before . It 's a genie love boudoir especially built to withstand hot genie love . The kind of love that would kill an ordinary man . Do you think you 're ready , baby ? Oh , yeah . I 'm ready . I think I 'm ready . Oh , I 'm so glad , darling . Just promise me one thing . - You name it . - Be gentle with me . A genie in the thrones of passion can generate some serious heat . I 'm ready for hot . I 'm so ready for hot . Good , becuase we 're talking upwards of 2,000 degrees . [ screaming ] Wow ! You should be totally fried . - I didn 't feel a thing . - Oh ... good . - I guess it 's time to sterilize you . - Sterilize ? As in clean . You 've got to be germ-free to mate with a genie . Prepare for laser dermal penetration . What ? [ screaming ] Gee , hon . Do you think you can handle this ? We could always wait . No . I don 't want to deprive you . Chett , you can 't take any more ! Abort ! Abort ! No . Focus on the pain . Must ... consummate . Don 't worry . That 's all it takes . Are you crazy ? You almost turned yourself into a steamed dumpling just to spend one night with me . Did it really mean that much to you ? [ groaning ] Oh , that is so sweet . Well , nobody can say you didn 't earn it . What the heck . Take me . It 's yours , Chett . [ groaning ] Men . - What 's with you ? - It 's over . She left me . I 'm only 17 years old and I 'm already looking for wife number two . You 're still young . You 'll meet somebody else . Who 's going to want me ? I 'm used goods . Knowing the future ruined my life . Ohh ... relax . She ... wasn 't really going to be your wife anyway . What ? ! The bride-tracker wasn 't real . It was just box with lights on it . But ... I ... if Barbara was ... What about my wish ? ! I chose not to grant it . You put me through all of that for a joke ? For a lesson . If Barbara had been your wife you would have ruined your entire life . Thanks to me , you didn 't . Ain 't you glad ? Come on . Ain 't you glad ? - [ muffed ] : Yes . - Then what do you say ? - I don 't know . - Yes , you do . - Say it . - Don 't want to . Wyatt ... Thank you , Lisa . You 're welcome , Wyatt .

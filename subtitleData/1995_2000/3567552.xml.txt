 - [ Floor Creaking ] - [ Muffled Groan ] Oh , no , no . ! Wait . ! Wait a minute ! I didn 't do anything ! Wait ! I didn 't do anything . - Wait . What ? What the hell is that ? - Move it . - No ! - Look , I want to call my father . ! Do you hear me ? - Nice p.j. ' s . - They pulled me right out of bed . - I was in the shower . - Mmm . Thanks for painting that one for me . - What the hell 's goin ' on here ? - Trouble . The worst kind . [ CollarJingling ] [ Brakes Hiss , Squeak ] I thought you were leavin ' town . Well , I came to say good-bye , Sharpton ... and I knew you 'd be here , like you are every night , collecting your payoff . Same Bat Time , same Bat Channel . [ Clicks Teeth ] I heard that on a rerun . - I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . - Every night ... you head out alone , you make your run , collecting your drug money . Then , one night , you hit a little girl . You couldn 't stop ... because of all the contraband you had on board ... so you let her bleed to death . Tell me , what are you gonna do about it ? I 'm gonna make sure that this is your last run . [ Laughing ] You got it all down pat , don 't you ? Well , you 're right , I do deliver drugs and I do love my money ... and I do head out alone , but you left out a little somethin ' . - What 's that ? - The part where I stop and pick up my partner . - [ Groans ] - [ Laughing ] - Come on . We 're gonna be late . - He 'll freeze to death out here . Yeah , it 's a rough world , ain 't it ? [ Truck Doors Open , Close ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Scratching , Bell Jingling ] [ Barks ] Hey . Don 't twitch . The dog 'll rip your Adam 's apple clear out of your throat . - Won 't ya ? - [ Growls ] Don 't get me wrong , he 's a good-lookin 'dog , but that dog was born mean . - [ Barks ] - He did save your life , however . Found you in a parking lot . Yeah , barked his head off till I found you . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Yeah , there you go . - [ Groaning ] - [ Dog Whimpers ] - Hey , what are you looking at ? You got something to add to this ? Why don 't you get out of here and go to bed ? No , no . Don 't try gettin ' up . Don 't try gettin ' up . You need to just stay right there and rest . You got smashed pretty hard . You just rest . You need to rest . You need to rest there . You just rest . - What happened ? - Wh-What happened ? Oh , you , my friend , have been mugged ... and , oh , no , they got all your money . l-I 'm sorry . All your money 's gone . That 's bad ... but your stuff is safe - I saved your stuff . - So that 's good . - Where am I ? Where are you ? You , my friend ... are in my little corner of paradise - at least for now . Hey , hey ! My name is Argyle , by the way . My name is Argyle , and I 'm called this on account of this birthmark ... that I got on the back of my thigh . You wanna see it ? You wanna check it out ? No . Okay , that 's cool , most people don 't . No offense taken . You got a lot of stuff in here , dude . Hey , I hope my patch job keeps in the blood okay ... because , look , Dog never complained about the doctoring ... but , hey , I think you 'd be a better judge ... you being the real M.D. and all . - [ Weakly ] Doctor ? - Yeah . You 're a doctor , my friend . This I.D. here says that your name is Jarod ... and you , my friend , are a thoracic surgeon . Get me a three c.c. syringe and a size 8 E. T. - She 's going into respiratory arrest . - Prepare to ventilate . Give me the syringe . Remove the plunger . Air entry on both sides of the chest . She 's pinking up . - [ Heavy Breathing ] - Now that 's a nice sound . - [ Banging ] - Come on . Come on . Yeah . ! Yeah , baby . - [ Hissing ] - Now , that 's a nice sound . We 're gonna have some heat . Ow ! Ow ! Nothing ever works in this place , including you . Never ! That 's all gonna change . That 's all gonna change real soon . I 'm thinkin ' four years of college . I 'm thinkin ' medical school . I 'm thinking doctoring and prescriptions . - You know , I 've been ridin the wooden pony for years now ... - [ Electrical Buzzing ] and I 'm thinkin ' , my man , you might just be my brass ring . - Brass ring ? - Pot o ' gold , boy . Ship that 's come in . A way out , man . I 'm thinkin ' a hospital will pay a healthy finder 's fee ... for one of their prized physicians . Not a doctor . You 're not a doctor . Come on . Who the hell are you then ? I don 't know . [ Breathing Heavily ] - [ Broots ] What is this ? - [ Miss Parker ] It 's a T-board . - A what ? - " T " standing for " torture . " The Centre tribunal . They want answers and , until they get them , we 're not going anywhere . What ? No . You 're kidding , right ? Don 't soil yourself , Broots . They want us off balance . That 's why they yanked us in the dead of night . They 're trying to fracture us - emotionally . Well , it 's working . I 'm shattering . How do you know so much about this ? I 've been on the other side of the glass . Well , so , how does it turn out ? Fine . If you 're on the other side of the glass . [ Sighs ] Oh , great . [ Sydney ] I knew Raines would be involved . - [ Broots ] What ? - The question is , who 's behind it all ? The Triumvirate , Kreskin . - But under whose authority ? - [ Sydney ] Brigitte . That bitch is like a bad cough . [ Broots ] Who are those guys in the shadows ? I don 't know . We need to get word to my father . - Here . I 'm not sure he 'll be able to help . - [ Sighs ] Sydney . [ Phone Beeping ] - [ Line Ringing ] - Hello , lovey . - [ Beeps Off ] - Bridget . Last time I saw you ... you were trying to blow my father 's helicopter out of the sky . How did you get back in the Centre ? Well , before we get to that , I 've promised some friends of mine ... I 'd find out why , after 18 months , Jarod is still out there . Not possible . They created him . - They know what he 's capable of . - Yes . They do . They think the only way he could be eluding the Centre ... is if one , or all of you , are working with him . [ Scoffs ] They think that ? Or you made them think that ? Either way , no one 's leaving till we find out who . And we start with you , Tex . [ Rhythmic Clacking ] Whoever you are , you got a tooth sweeter than mine , that 's for sure . Sugar 's a killer , you know that ? It 'll rot all your teeth out , right out of your head . I 'm lucky . I 'm blessed . I got really good teeth . They 're all mine . Hey , buddy . What 's wrong ? Oh , no . You don 't know who you are and you 're burning up . That 's what happens when you 're left out in the elements . That 's what happens . Your problem was , you weren 't lookin over your shoulder . You always gotta look over your shoulder , man . There 's always somebody back there in the dark , some mook ... some punk back there gunning 'for ya . I know . You gotta look over your shoulder , man . Look over your shoulder . Or maybe you 're runnin ' away from this cutie-pie . Who 's this ? Hey . ! Psst . ! Psst . ! Who 's this pretty lady ? What 'd she do ? Bust your rocks for not bringin 'home the green ? " Hey , you didn 't bring home the green . " Maybe you should 've been a doctor , you know ? You gotta think twice about that next time . Well , I 'll beJohn Brown . I will beJohn Brown . You 're not a doctor , you 're a park ranger . No , you 're a fireman . No , you 're a roach exterminator . No , you 're a federal investigator . I 'm-I 'm sorry , mister . Could you help me out here for a second ? I 'm kind of at a loss here . Who the hell are you ? Mister ? Mister ? I don 't know who I am . I didn 't do anything . - [ Gasps ] - Broots . Scared . [ Sydney ] How do you think he 'll hold up ? Before or after he wets his pants ? Can I - Can I have a robe ? - Is Jarod smarter than you ? - Huh ? - You 've been chasing him for over a year . - Has he eluded you ... because he 's smarter ? No . We try hard every day to find Jarod ... but the wheel of fortunejust hasn 't landed on our number yet . Spinning , spinning , spinning . Well , he is a Pretender . He 's a one-man Siegfried and Roy . Show me what you have . Jarod interconnected 173 international calls ... but backtracking those calls was impossible because ... instead of a call-forwarding device triggered by a single call ... all 173 calls were individually initiated . - Ingenious . - And very expensive . - I don 't care what it cost . - Oh , that 's good ... becauseJarod charged it to your calling card . [ Laughs ] He 's clever and smart ... which makes tracking Jarod more fun . Fun ? - No , I - - Are you saying he 's your hero ? No . I 'm , I 'm - No . I 'm not saying that . Then what are you saying ? I 'm just saying that - Jarod is clever ... and you can see it in his eyes . - You can tell . - According to your file ... you 've never laid eyes on Jarod . - You never have , have you ? - No , I - Uh , I 'm referring to pictures . - Hello , Mr. Broots . - Oh , my God . ! Help me . Please . 18 months , no results . We find it hard to believe that someone could be this inept on purpose . [ Jarod 's Voice Echoing ] Help me . - Mr. Broots . - Huh ? If you 're not helping Jarod , then who is ? C-Can I have a robe , please ? [ Argyle ] We 're alike , you and me-bunch of names ... travel light , man on the run . - [ Shivering ] - Who you runnin ' from anyway ? John Law ? The man with the smile on his face ... evil in his heart ? Huh ? Who you runnin ' from ? - Hey . ! Maybe you got a bounty on your head . - [ Shivering ] Your head is burnin ' up . You 're burnin ' up , man . Oh , no , this is not good . You 've been out in the elements too long , man . Out in the elements too long . I knew it . This is not good . I knew it . This is bad . - [ Banging ] - Hey ! A little cooperation in the heat department ! [ Woman 's Voice ] Jarod . - [ Banging ] - [ Argyle ] Come on . Come on . ! - Hey . ! - I love you , Jarod . - Don 't leave me . - [ Banging ] - Come on ! Please don 't leave me . - [ Banging Continues ] - Come on ! Hey ! Hey ! You okay , man ? - You okay ? - [ Whimpers ] No . ! No . ! No , don 't you die on me , man . Don 't you die on me . ! Don 't you leave me . You 're my brass ring , man . Come on ! Don 't you die on me , man . Don 't you die on me , man . [ Young Jarod ] First warning is a flash . I know the escape procedure , but the fire , it 's too hot . It comes into our air lines . I try not to breathe , but it 's too late . I can 't open the hatch . I can 't open the hatch ! No one can get to us . We can 't be saved . I 'm burning ! I 'm burning ! - I 'm burning . ! - [ Groans ] I 'm burning ! Hey ! Your fever broke . The devil left you with me for a while . So , what 's the Centre ? Y-Y-Your little freakish home movies are all labeled : " For Centre Use Only " - What 's the Centre ? - I don 't know . - You don 't know . l-l-I 'll tell you what I think , Jarod . I think you got a big brain ... and l-I think that these Centre guys - I think they 're after you ... and I think that means you 're worth something to them ... which means that you 're worth a lot to me . You see , I got a big brain , too , Jarod . I got a big brain too . Why won 't you work ? Why won 't you work ? Why won 't you work ? Why ... won 't ... you ... work ? [ Panting ] I 'm just trying to fix things , Jarod . I 'm just tryin to make ' em right . No big deal . No big deal . I 'm just tryin to fix things . Who are you ? The proudest woman in the world . - Who am I ? - Just trust your feelings . Always trust your feelings . [ Young Sydney ] Jarod , I told you . I can 't accept this . [ Young Jarod ] But I made it for you . - [ Beeps ] - This card is meant for someone else . Don 't you love me , Sydney ? We have work to do . Is Sydney your dad or something ? Oh , I 'm so glad I left Debbie at her godmother 's . I can 't believe how long they 've had Sydney out there . You wear a watch to bed ? - Yeah . - Why ? In case I wake up and , you know , need to document something . [ Crumbles Paper ] Let us continue . When are they gonna leave him alone ? - When they hear what they wanna hear . - He 's been out there six hours . And they 'll take another six if they want to . What are they doing this for ? Because they can . [ Sydney ] Jarod is my life 's work . My interest in him is primarily scientific . That interest demands that I remain objective ... which precludes the possibility of guilt . [ Young Jarod ] Don 't you love me , Sydney ? Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . I have betrayed a friend . - Have you prayed to the Lord ? - Not even he ... can forgive me for what I 've done . The bond between Jarod and me is as unique as Jarod is special . Unique enough for you to be fighting for his freedom ? I would never do that ! Jarod 's is a very complex case . I 've tried to keep him alive ... and to hold his psyche in check during this pursuit . What are you , his wet nurse ? We must be patient . Your tactics are far too aggressive . They day you really angerJarod is the day he 'll disappear forever . I have tried to bring him back . That is my objective . As a scientist ... I think the Centre is as good a place as he 'll find ... to maximize his tremendous potential . You don 't know whoJarod is . [ Sydney , Echoing ] You don 't know whoJarod is . [ Argyle , Echoing ] You 're not a doctor , you 're a park ranger . No , you 're a fireman . No , you 're a roach exterminator . No , you 're a federal investigator . I 'm sorry , mister . Who the hell are you ? [ Echoing ] Who the hell are you ? Who are you ? I can be anything I wanna be . I can be a doctor , an engineer . I can be an astronaut , but I don 't know who I am . Our father gave you this . - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm your brother . Jarod , go find our parents ! I wanna know what I look like . I wanna know who I am . [ Echoing ] I wanna know who I am . - I 'm not really a plastic surgeon . - My name is Jarod . - I 'm not really a doctor . - Jarod Jones . - I 'm not in the Coast Guard . - Jarod Campbell . - Jarod O 'Leary . - Jarod Wright . - Who the are you ? I sure as hell am not Florence Nightingale . This is what you look like . This is who you are . [ Echoing ] This is who you are . You 're my son . You 're my life . I love you , Jarod . - Then , one night , you hit a little girl . - [ Laughing ] [ Groans ] Jarod . - Hi , Jarod . - [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Continues ] - Hello ? - Hello . My name is Argyle . A-R-G-Y-L-E . Um , is this the Centre ? - Maybe . Why ? - I don 't know . Maybe I got somethin ' you want . Uh-huh . Well , I 'm all ears . Dog here , he 's a hero . See , I rescued him from the pound , and he saved you . He saved you . I saved him . That 's ironic . That 's ironic . Yes . - When did I go from patient to prisoner ? - Prisoner ? Prisoner ? Prisoner ? That is cold , man . That 's cold . - What would you call it ? - What would I call it ? What would I call it ? I - I 'd call it ironic . I called it ironic . I call it ironic . Just slip into my skin for a second , would ya ? Just for a second . A wigged-out stewardess gets a hangnail . Kills the entire flight crew . 300 people drop out of the clouds . Boom ! A postman goes postal . Bang ! A bus driver goes " bustal . " Crash ! And we , we , we all sit idly by and say , " What , are you crazy , man ? ' " Crazy ! That was so crazy ! I 'm glad it wasn 't me . " The point is , you-You been spouting ' wiggle for a while here ... and I 'm just makin ' sure that it 's not me , okay ? Fair is fair . And , by the way , I 'm not into hurting 'ya either . So you can rack easy on that , bro . Hey ! I wish we had a deck of cards ... because I got this great trick I could show you . - Is that my phone ? - Yeah . - Who did you call ? - Yeah . I just called the doctor . I called your doctor to see if he made house calls . - You called Sydney ? - No , no . He wasn 't there , but a lady answered . - Miss Parker ? - No , no , no , no . It was Bridget . - She sounded sexy . - Did you tell them where you are ? - Do I look like a road sign ? - Listen to me . These people , this organization , they will kill you . Trust me . Trust you ? No , you listen to me . Trust . Trust . Great word , right ? Trust . It 's on every coin , every bill , every buck and every bond in this country ... and yet it is still the one thing that you still can 't buy . Argyle ! They are setting you up . No . No , no , no , no , no ! Bridget said you 'd have an answer for everything and you do . Don 't ruin everything ! It 's good here ! It 's good . It 's good . Three hours ago , you didn 't know whether ... you were a park ranger or a rodeo clown . Now you 're crackin ' foxy about some secret organization that wants to hurt me . It 's you they want , my friend . It 's you . I just happen to hold the deed . You listen to me ! I speak from experience . You are dealing with the devil . [ Raines ] Thank you forjoining us , Miss Parker . Well , it was an invitation I simply couldn 't pass up . Lose the butt . You don 't have to worry about me blowing smoke . Put it out . [ Scoffs ] This is cruel - Even for a T-board . Fire away , babe . I 'm not goin 'anywhere . The Triumvirate is a bit murky concerning your motives ... in the pursuit ofJarod . Well , maybe they should pull their heads out of their ... sandboxes . I do myjob . Period . [ Raines ] What we 're looking for is the truth . Truth ? That is a very interesting word coming from you . So you have no other agenda in doing your job ? No unresolved issues or conflicts with the Centre orJarod ? I have no unresolved issues with the Centre . Is that the truth ? [ Jarod ] I know the truth , Miss Parker . And what truth is that , Jarod ? The truth about what makes you sad . [ Crying ] Mama ! Mama , no ! - Mama , no ! - Daddy , I wanna know ... what really happened to my mom . I have no unresolved issues with the Centre . You didn 't answer aboutJarod . [ Miss Parker ] Where did you find my mother 's ring ? In one of your mother 's safe deposit boxes . - Like her medical file ? - Oh , you 'd be surprised ... what one could find in there . - Jarod ! - You know the dance , Miss Parker . You help me with one of my secrets , I help you with one of yours . We weren 't able to find anything about Igor or Fenigor . I don 't know if he was my mother 's ally or betrayer . Well , keep searching . Igor holds the secrets to both our pasts . - [ Miss Parker ] What makes you so sure ? - [ Jarod ] Call it " gut feeling . ' " So you 're saying that in your past year-and-a-half pursuit ... he 's not had any undue influence on you ? - That 's what I 'm saying . - Not of any kind ? No influence at all . Not even emotional ? [ Jarod ] They say , " ' Tis better to have loved and lost ... than never to have loved at all . " - Do you believe that 's true ? - You paint a pretty sad picture . - How did we end up like this ? - Like what ? Alone . Searching . It 's ironic because we both want the same things - Someone to care about . Someone to care about us . Do you think we 'll ever find that kind oflove in our lives ? [ Echoing ] How did we end up like this ? [ Bridget ] Miss Parker ? Miss Parker . ! - Hi . - We 're done here . Miss Parker . You may have a cigarette now . [ Scoffs ] I just quit . [ Phone Ringing ] - Mr. Argyle . - You know , Bridget , if your body is ... half as good as your brain , you and I might just find a way , you know ? Coming from a man of your brilliance , that 's quite a compliment . Hey , by the way , you hit it right on the nail indeed - About Cashew Boy here ? He is a nut all right . Yes , he 's crazy , but he 's resourceful . So have you come up with a price ? Bridget , if this is aboutJarod - Shh ! I am on the phone . You know , I was out scamming this softy suburbanite the other day ... out ofhis lunch money , when I saw this Dapper Dan in a Rolls-Royce . - A Rolls-Royce , huh ? Uh-huh . - Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Real , real shiny . Anyway , this guy , right ? He gets out of the car ... and I find myself staring at his threads , right ? I 'm starin 'at the cat 's threads and I 'm thinkin 'to myself ... " I don 't know this dude from the president of England . ' " I don 't know if he 's a liar , if he kicks his dog , smacks his old lady - nothin ' - and yet I find myself having this instant , incredible respect for the guy ... on account of the suit he 's wearing . - Uh-huh . Go on . - Yeah . His suit , his shirt , his watch ... his loafers - the whole kit and caboodle . One piece more expensive than the next . Silk on silk , leather on leather ... and , you know , I 'm thinkin ' to myself , Bridget ... I 'm thinkin ' to myself ... to drape this guy , it must 've cost at least - I don 't know [ Machine Advances ] - At least ... $ 10,000 , Bridget . Is that the price of respect , Mr. Argyle ? Hey , hey , a man ain 't squat without respect . [ Sighs ] Well , $ 10,000 - that 's a great deal of money . But , um , I think I can convince my people to approve that . No ! No . Big brain . - Don 't do this . - Bridget , write this down . That 's just three hours away . I 'm on the next plane . If you 've found Jarod , I am the only one who can bring him in . Sorry , darlin ' , this time he comes in . Hey , hey . It 's all for the best . You 're goin ' back where you belong . I 'm gettin ' out of here . It 'll all be fine . Trust me . Trust me . - This sucks . - Why are they making us just ... sit here and wait ? [ Sighs ] So when Wonder Woman brings him in ... it will prove the point we didn 't because one of us was helping him . Leaving us as good as dead , hmm ? Gee , I never thought I 'd be rooting forJarod . I didn 't mean that . I , uh , I didn 't mean that . - [ Door Opens Abruptly ] - Daddy ! Angel . I came as soon as I found out . How dare they put my daughter through a T-board . Are you all right ? - For now . - You 'll all be out of here - after I lop off a few heads . - Daddy , be careful . - Right . Boy , now I never thought I 'd be glad to see your old man . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm glad he 's here too , Broots . [ Sydney ] Hmm . Unfortunately ... there 's reason to believe he 's been here the whole time . I 'm sorry , Parker . [ Miss Parker ] He 's done it again . [ Tires Screeching ] - Mr. Argyle . - Bridget ? - Nice to see you . - Nice to see you . - Beautiful day , isn 't it ? - Beautiful . - Open the trunk , Willie . Get the bag . - You got something for me ? - Your suit 's quite attractive . - Nice to put the face to the body . Thank you . I bring you respect in a bag . Oh , wow . 10,000 real ones . - Where 's Jarod ? - He 's in the basement . - In the boiler room . Hey ! - Willie ... when you see I haveJarod , put a bullet in his brain . - If you can find it . - My pleasure . What are you talkin ' about , " Bullet in my brain " ? That 's not nice . Hey . ! Hey . ! [ Groans ] Damn ! [ Groans ] [ Gun Cocks ] Well , if it isn 't Sleeping Beauty . And they said you were so hard to catch . Hmm . [ Whistles ] Time to rise and shine . Wake up , my little love-muffin . Come on , baby . Wake up . Wake up ! Hi . Time to go home . Sorry , but I 'm never going back there . [ Screams , Groans ] [ Barking , Whimpers ] [ Banging , Crashing ] [ Jingling ] [ Whimpers ] - [ Whimpers ] - [ Groans ] - [ Whimpers ] - You 're not so mean . [ Whimpering ] [ Gunshot ] Nice to see you again , Willie . [ Grunts ] [ Screams ] - Hi . - Your brass ring . I knew you were the one to trust , right from the start . Mm . On second thought ... I think I 'll donate it ... to the pound - in Dog 's name . Like you said , he 's the hero . And give me back my Pez . [ Ringing ] - Brigitte ? - Nope . Sorry . It 's justJarod . But you can come and pick up your blonde now . Sweet dreams ... love . [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] She blew it , didn 't she ? - Jarod ? - Alive . Still free . - So are you . - Oh , thanks for the robe . - I 'll give you a lift . - To where , Daddy ? Another dead end ? - What are you talking about ? - Don 't you dare ! You set me up for a T-board ? [ Chuckles ] I was wondering how long ... it would take you to figure that out . Come on , you really don 't think I could fool you . You 're a Parker . I 'd be stupid to even try . Besides , these damn shoes are killin ' me . If this is true , then why would you ally with Bridget ? Bridget cut a deal with the Triumvirate - Your butt for hers . I had to go along with it to get rid of her for good . Action , reaction , give-and-take - It 's not about who knows what . It 's about who thinks they know what ... and what you want ' em to think . - l - - Look . To keep the hungry dogs away , you must toss ' em a bone now and then . Is that what I am , a bone ? You 're my legacy , and you proved it again today . Never forget that . It 'll keep ya alive . Trust me . If you should find something I could trust . I didn 't think you 'd trust me . - Trust me . - How can you still trust him ? Trust him . Will you be all right , Miss Parker ? [ Sighs ] Of course . Let 's get out of here . Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . Listen , do you think that someone in the Centre is really helping Jarod ? In the Centre , anything is possible . [ Keyboard Tapping ] [ Raines ] We 're still searching for him ... but we will find the leak . Did you uncover something that can help us find Jarod , Angelo ? Keep working . [ Wheezing ] Keep working . - [ Keyboard Tapping ] - [ Sighs ] [ Crunches Loudly ] See you tomorrow , same Bat Time , same Bat Channel . - You remember me ? - You don 't learn so easy , do ya , pal ? Maybe not , but I never make the same mistake twice . - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm many people ... but tonight ... I 'm a truck driver . [ Screaming ] [ Horn Honking ]

 Oh . Get a load of that one . She 's sublime . Those twitchy eyes ... Those powerful forelimbs . Every 7 years , it 's the same thing ... mantis mating season . Wait ! That one 's even cuter . - Lovely pincers . - Ch-ch-ch ! Look , zorak , the show 's about to start . I 've got to switch the feed . No ! Don 't ! I think I just spotted the girl of my dreams . Which girl ? That girl ! Greetings , citizens . Uh , whoops ... Ah , better . Oh , it 's going to be one ofthoseshows . I think instead I 'll watch the lava network . Ooh . Greetings . I 'm space ghost . Welcome to the show . Today 's guests include ... Uh , show 's over . Good night ! Good night , everybody ! Make sweet love to me . - What ? Closing credit music ? - Yikes ! - Wow . Hold it . - What is going on ? - Stop those credits ! - Moltar ! - Sorry , s.G. - I thought the show was over . It is . - Nonsense ! - I had just started . No , you finished . - I did ? - Yes ! Uh ... Um ... Who was on the show ? It 's right here . " Tonight , the interplanetary talk show host " interviewed tv star Catherine bach and singer-songwriter Matthew sweet . " - Hmm . I can 't remember . - Did I do the show or not ? What did Catherine bach have to say ? Oh , she told a very amusing anecdote about a bowling trophy . Is that right , moltar ? Uh , I think so . And how about Matthew sweet ? What did he have to say ? Nothing . Nothing ? I find that hard to believe . - Wait . You 're right . - He did say something . Hmm ... My superpower senses are tingling . What are they trying to tell me ? Is it time to switch mouthwash ? Stock up on string cheese ? Start wearing a derby ! - I 've got it . - Zorak 's lying ! - No more fibs ! - What 's going on ? Aah ! Mating season on my planet started 20 minutes ago . I must go . To get butter and cheese ? I feel ... The urge ! Typical musician . Look , we have a show to do , and you can 't leave till it 's over . Put a lid on it , zorak ... or whatever you do . You 'll just have to wait 15 minutes before you go spread your evil seed . I want to talk to Catherine bach and ask her about that bowling trophy . Ok , I won 't try and look at myself . Greetings , citizen Catherine , and welcome to the show . Thank you , space ghost . Tell me , Catherine , do you have a bowling trophy ? Yes , I do . Ah ! Ha ha ha ! Thatwas a good anecdote . Ha ha ha ! I 'm getting splotchy . As we all know , you originated the role of Daisy on the Dukes of hazza , and I think we all want to know , what two words would you use to describe boss hogg ? Monkey gland , uh ... Sauce ? Uh , two words , please . So delicate and perfect . - You could tell . - And how did they treat you on that show ? Would they give you a whole meal or just one course ? The Dukes of Hazzard gave me the entree . - But no dessert ? - Hmm ... Sounds kind of cheap . Now , your new tv series takes you to a new continent . Tell me , how is Africa different from the states ? There 's no siegfried and Roy in , um , in South Africa . - What ? - I didn 't know that . Moltar , get my investment adviser on the phone . Divest all interest in South Africa immediately ! Uh , those views were mine and do not necessarily reflect the station or its owners . Quick , Catherine , cover for me ! Tell a story about the black rhino . First of all , the black rhino does not breed in captivity . Nor do I ! They are now taking the black rhino and trying to impregnate the white rhino , the female white rhino ... Go on . Would you please keep your mind on the music ? - I can 't . - It 's mating season . So what 's the big deal ? Unless ... Zorak , is it your first time ? - Don 't be ridiculous ! - I 've mated , uh , plenty of times ! - Wait a minute . - That can 't be true ! And why not ? Because your head 's still attached to your body . Whew ! You see , in the mantis marital act , the female typically eats the head and brain of the male . You 're kidding . You didn 't know that ? That 's not what my mother told me . Ha ha ha ! It 's not funny ! Ha ha ha ! Catherine , I 'll have to ask you to please stop laughing . I 'm serious ! I warned you . Ok , zorak , she 's gone . And you know what I was thinking ? If you want to go mate , I shouldn 't stop you . It 's every space creature 's inalienable right to know love and be loved and have love and share love and know love and ... did I say that one already ? I 'm not so sure I want to be loved anymore . What , are you afraid of commitment ? Hey , look , there 's Matthew sweet ! The teen tycoon of rock frombeyond the valley of the dolls . Uh , tell me , Matt , uh , how do your pants , uh , stay up ? I just concentrate very hard . It 's built into my brain . Like , I don 't even need a belt for that . - Very good . - Here 's a riddle . What would you eat with a biodip ? A biochip . You 're sharp . I bet you 're pretty powerful , too . You know , I can use my power bands to bring the Atlantic ocean to a boiling point in 5 seconds . Can you point a finger and heat something up ? If you mean like baking a potato or boiling an egg , I might be ok . - I thought so . - Keep working at it . You have the makings of superhero . Perhaps I could give you some tips . Bl-bl-bl-bl ! I can 't hold it ! I must go to my home planet ! I wantlove ! But the consequences ... bl-bl-bl-bl ! Yeah , go on . Matthew , what do you think ? Should zorak go home to mate ? Uh , have a good time , all the time . Even if it means certain death ? Why not ? That settles it ! I 'm off , and I 'm taking the phantom cruiser . All right , but in the event you lose your head , call a cab . Oh , and , uh , there 's a gino vanelli tape in the glove compartment . Yee-hoo ! Heh , heh , dear me . A thousand pardons , friends . Zorak 's music normally covers that . It 's all because you sneak bites from a pork chop sandwich during station breaks . Mmm ... . I don 't know what you 're talking about . It 's a disgusting habit ! Come on , lots of people are doing it . Matthew sweet , you 're a man of the world . Have you ever had a big , sloppy pork chop sandwich ? Yeah , it wasn 't too good . We had to cancel some shows . Needless to say , I haven 't done it since then . Ah , you 're no help . What was I talking about ? That 's right , no music . Well , we can 't have that , so I will provide it . - Oh , really ? - You bet ! Steve Allen played the piano , Arthur Godfrey played the ukulele , and I , space ghost , play the blues harp . Can 't really do it unless someone 's telling a sad story . Tell a sad story . Uh , well , I ... What happens is , I 'll drink ... perfect . Keep going ! I get really thirsty onstage , and I don 't feel it or anything because I just have a couple of beers . Yeah , yeah . But when they 're empty , I keep going back and picking up an empty bottle over and over again . It makes me really frustrated . Sadder . Make it sadder . So I got in the habit of knocking them off the back of the amplifier because they would never break . Testify ! Uh ... Go on with your bad self ! Like , a beer bottle 's pretty sturdy . * A beer bottle 's pretty sturdy * But anyhow , so I would knock them off the back , and one night , I knocked one off , and I guess it must have exploded or something , because I was playing the last song , and my hands felt all sticky , and I looked down , and there was blood everywhere . We should take this show on the road , play the house of blues ! Here 's where he mentions Dan aykroyd . - Hey , I know Dan aykroyd . - I know Dan aykroyd . Matthew , can I ask you a favor ? All right . Would you mind holding your breath while I ask moltar a non-show-related question ? Moltar , what 's going on with zorak ? My readings show he 's landed on his home planet and is zeroing in on his target . If I said you had a beautiful exoskeleton , would you hold it against me ? Ha ha ha ! Struck out ! You know , moltar , I never realized how scrawny zorak was compared to the others . Yeah , his steady diet of evil has taken its toll . Ultimately the internal manifests itself in the external . Um , yeah . I wish I had the slightest idea what moltar was talking about . - Uh , space ghost ? - What ? You should check on Matthew . I think we 're about to lose him . Silly me ! Ha ha . Matthew , you can stop now . You know , Matthew , just because somebody tells you to do something doesn 't mean you should always do it . Really ? Do you think , in the future , you should try to be more careful ? Yeah , a little more careful . Space ghost , you better check this out . There 's activity on zorak 's home planet . Looks like zorak 's made a love connection ! Do you like walks in the rain ? Oh , yes ! And Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's sonnets from the Portuguese ? How did you know ? I know things about you . You 're the most exciting mantis I 've ever met . I want to spend the rest of my life with you . And so you shall ! Zorak going to his home planet was a great idea . Love has transformed him . When he comes back , he 'll be a new bug . I don 't think he 'll be coming back . Why not ? I explained it all earlier in the show . Don 't you remember ? Of course I remember . I have to go to the little ghost 's room . - - - Got to use my memory . The female typically eats the head and brain of the male . The male ... The head ... Dear lord ! That 's right ! Sorry , Matthew , our time is up . There 's a crisis , and you 've got to understand , I 'm a superhero first and a talk show host second . We can be invisible together . Nice try , but I was saving galaxies while you were still reading along with the lyrics of the three dog night harmonyalbum . I think I can handle this one alone . Good-bye . Moltar , it 's time for action . We must get zorak out of there ! - Well , what can we do ? - Nature must run its course . Plus , he took the phantom cruiser . But this means certain death for zorak . I know . Uh , can I have his dressing room ? How can you think of dressing rooms at a time like this , a time of great sadness ? Oh , zorak , we hardly knew ye . Yes , you were pure evil , but I learned to see the good in that . I 'll miss you , my little friend who used to try and kill me , but rest assured , you will not be forgotten . I 'll always remember that vile , near-poisonous gas you would emit whenever you were happy , and I 'll never forget lunching with you in the commissary , watching you eat 10 raw chickens and drink toner from the copy machine . You loved that toner . - I know ! - We 'll have a parade ! We 'll declare a national holiday on the ghost planet , with wonderful floats and big balloons , and we 'll all drink fizzy lemonade and eat neapolitan ice cream ! We 'll celebrate the moments of your life , zorak ! You shall not have died in vain ! A ghost ! Idiot . Zorak , is that really you ? Yes ! He 's back ! Darn ! I wanted that neapolitan ice cream . What happened on your home planet ? I don 't want to talk about it . But you couldn 't have mated . We can see your head 's still attached to your body . I said I don 't want to talk about it ! We 're all coworkers here . There 's nothing you couldn 't open up and tell us . Couldn 't close the deal , could you ? Thatwasn 't the problem . Then what was ? I mean , we saw you leave with that lady mantis . That lady mantis ... Wasn 't really a lady . Not really a lady ? Huh ? Then she must have been ... wait ! You were digging on a dude ? It 's not what you think . Carl is part of a male mantis resistance movement that intercedes at the moment when the urge is the worst . He lured me back to his nest , where we ate barbecue and talked sports until the urge had passed . He saved my life , and for that , I will always be grateful . What a remarkable story . I wonder who owns the movie rights . Ted Turner . Oh , well , never mind . We 're just glad to have you back . - And I 'm glad to be back . - You know why ? Because now I can continue to plot my revenge against you , space ghost , and make every moment of your life a living heck ! Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! It 's not funny !

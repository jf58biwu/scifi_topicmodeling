 Previously on The Pretender . All the weirdness around here is courtesy of Mr. Skin Grafts himself . - The place has been different ever since - - Since Raines was shot . - I 'm no marksman . - I didn 't even want to take a gun , remember ? Well , if I 'd have shot Sterno-head , he 'd be snoring through dirt right now ... instead of filling bedpans in the Centre burn unit . Guess the Centre cut you out of the loop this time . Good thing they sent a replacement . - [ Sydney ] What are you talking about ? - [ Jarod ] The blonde . Oh , any progress locating your missing father ? Who says he 's missing ? [ Vocalizing ] It 's time to come home , Jarod . [ Echoing ] Take my hand . [ Echoing ] [ Grunts ] I can 't reach you , Mom . Try . [ Echoing ] You can do it . [ Echoing ] Mom . Mom , don 't go . Mom . Mom . Don 't go . [ Mewing ] [ Man ] This is whereJarod spent most ofhis time while he stayed with us . - [ Miss Parker ] In a tepee ? - Yeah . But no , this is a sensory-deprivation tank . I 'm surprised he 'd even get near one of these things again . Ah , butJarod enjoyed floating in the tank . It gave him a taste of the freedom he so desperately craved . Most people will go in the tank for an hour , tops . Jarod-Jarod would stay in for , like , days at a time . Then he would come out , and he would go around hugging everyone he saw . I never experienced such a connection to another human being in my entire life . Maybe if he showered once in a while , the experience wouldn 't be quite so unique . Did Jarod leave anything behind ? He said to give you this . Thank you . [ Chuckles ] I have a gun , and I 'll use it . - Cool . - Let 's go find Wonder Boy . Living in a tepee . Somebody help me . Help ! Someone , please help me ! Help me . Please ! [ Yelling ] I 'm coming . Just hang on . Jarod , wait for the basket . [ Jarod ] There 's no time . His rope 's not going to hold . Roger , call the chopper now ! [ Whimpering ] Just hang on . More line . Jarod , what the hell are you doing ? I said wait for the basket ! Sit tight . I got you . [ Gasps ] - [ Grunting ] - It 's a great day to be alive . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Man On Radio ] 131 , call your office . Word from the hospital is your victim 's gonna be fine . - Oh , that 's great news . - And the word around here is that you 're a player . - [ Chuckles ] - You should have seen him . - Instant legend , man . - [ Chuckles ] Better watch out , Bobby . Looks like there 's a new Spider-Man in town . Yeah , well , we 'll see who has the web . - Spider ... Man ? - Yeah , like in the comics . Hey , guys , look . Real estate brochures from Denver . - Looks like you 're serious . - Are you thinking of transferring out ? Retiring . Denver 's where my grandson is . Come on , you guys . This is a good thing . - Makes room for the young guys moving ' up . - Ah [ All Chuckle ] - Okay , pack and sack . We 're due at the tower in 30 . [ Sighs ] Oh , man . It 's gonna be the third drill this week . Well , get used to it . If Bobby makes captain , he 'll drill us 24-7 . You got that right . Jarod . Everyone kicks in . S.O.P. It 's sort of a ritual . Every time we come back safe from a run ... we drop in a five for Chris . - He 's the guy that fell from the drill tower . - Just came out of a coma . I thought the department insurance plan covered accidents . It does cover accidents , but , um ... Chris tried to kill himself . [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] Where have you guys been ? Mmm . To our own little corner of heaven . - Got you somethin ' . - Oh , thanks . - You won 't believe what 's going on around here . - I rarely do . - Any word on my father ? - No . No one knows where he is . [ Clicks Tongue ] Princess Try Hard knows . You don 't want to make accusations you can 't prove . Oh , please . Sydney , you know what ? Do yourself a favor . Take some steroids . Ever since she and Mr. Lyle showed up , this whole place has gotten strange . Yeah , well , it 's just about to get stranger . - There he is . That 's the guy . - [ Sydney ] What guy ? - Oh , God . They 're comin ' this way . - Ah , Miss Parker . Sydney , Mr. Broots . This is Dr. Curtis . He 's ... consulting ... for Mr. Lyle and me . Nice to meet you . - I 'm sure . - [ Murmurs ] If he needs to speak with you ... we 'd appreciate it if you 'd make yourselves available . Certainly . Cheers . Shall we ? Doctor . - Who is he ? - That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . He 's - He 's some kind of criminal behaviorist . They brought him here to find out who shot Mr. Raines . Oh , God . This is bad . This is really , really bad . Relax , Broots . They are looking for a shooter , not a whiner . Yeah , well , they 're gonna pin the shooting on someone . The way I see it , we 're the ones walkin ' around with the biggest targets on our backs . If you 're innocent , you have nothing to worry about . Sydney , this is the Centre . Maybe no one will miss you , but I have a little daughter who loves her daddy . We don 't even know if he 'll want to talk to us . Oh , fat chance . I hear Mr. Raines ... is gonna force everyone who was at the shooting to interview with this guy . - And I mean everyone . - Peachy . Move it . ! Come on , Jarod . ! Your victims have time to take in a double feature . - Go ! Go , go , go , go , go , go , go ! - Go . ! Go . ! Go . ! - Two minutes . ! - Move it ! 2 : 01 . 2.02 . 2.03 . - Let 's move it ! Come on . - 2.04 . - All the way . ! - 2.05 . 2.06 . - 2 : 07 . Not bad . - Not good either . - Not for a simple up and over . - [ Man ] Hey . ! Keep it down over there ! Tryin 'to think over here . ! Oh , God . We woke up the monster . - Who 's that ? - Uh , he likes to be called Spencer . All he does is complain about the noise and write poetry . Don 't get him goin ' . You 're gonna have to buy somethin ' . Is this where Chris tried to kill himself ? Roger found him right here . You know , I thought Chris and I could tell each other everything . I knew he was depressed , but he never said anything about suicide . Maybe it wasn 't . He left a note on his computer . You know , I saw this happen in Chicago . This guy , he got really depressed about thejob . - All the pressure . - No , it wasn 't the job . Chris loved rescue . Well , if it wasn 't the job , maybe it was his family . His mother left when he was really little . She just walked out . After his dad died a couple years ago , Chris started looking for her . - He didn 't find her ? - No . But he felt she was close by . He ran personal ads in the paper , searched the Net . Did everything he could think of . Well , he probably thought he would never find her . That he would always have that feeling of emptiness . I can 't imagine what it would be like never knowing your mother . Chris , Chris . Chris , you need to be calm . Chris . Chris . You need to calm down . - [ Beeping ] - Chris . Ca - No , please . Calm down , please . Chris . I 'm sorry . This is a really bad time for a visitor . Chris . No . - Chris - - Chris . - Chris , calm down . - Please , could you come back later ? It 's not unusual for a post-coma victim to lose sense of time and location . He 's afraid . He needs human contact . He needs to know that he 's loved . - Are you a therapist ? - I know what it 's like to be isolated from people . - Joellen , come here . - Oh , oh . Chris . Hold him . - Go ahead . He 's still your friend . Hold him . - Chris . Chris , it 's Joellen . It 's Joellen . Shh . It 's Joellen . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's all right . It 's all right . Shh . Shh . Let 's go over this again , because I want to get it straight . He was a spider ... and a man . No . He was a high school student bitten by a radioactive spider . Hmm . That must have hurt . Then he developed spider powers . You know , he could climb up walls , he could shoot webs , and ... - he had spider sense . - Which is ? I don 't know . He - He , uh - His head would tingle and stuff . Well , I wasn 't aware that arachnids had heads that tingled . I don 't know from arachnids . But Spider-Man 's did . It 's fascinating . I 'll read them all . Mrs. Welman . My name is Jarod . I 'm a friend of Chris . l-You-You have the wrong person . My name is Carter . I know it was - before you were married . - What do you want ? - It 's not what I want . It 's what Chris wants . He 's been trying to find you . Mrs. Welman , your son needs you . I didn 't ask to be needed . And I sure as hell didn 't ask to be found . [ Vocalizing ] [ Young Jarod ] Mom , I love you . I love you , Mom . Mom . I love you . Don 't leave me , Mom . Mom . Mom , don 't go . Mom . Mom , don 't go . [ Young Jarod ] Sydney , did your mother ever hug you ? Jarod , it 's important that you get in the tank . What was it like to be hugged by your mother ? - How did it feel ? - That 's not relevant . Jarod , the tank relaxes you . You could focus on the simulation . I want to know what it 's like to be hugged . I 've forgotten what it feels like . Jarod , listen to me . You will never have that experience . Your mother is - It would be best if you just forgot about her . No . I 'll never forget her . - Never . - Jarod . Dwelling on your family will only get in the way of your work . Finding my family is my work , Sydney . We 're only trying to find out who had the capacity to shoot Mr. Raines . [ Sydney ] And I 'm only here to help . Look , I realize this is a difficult position for you to be in . Mm-mmm . Perhaps just a waste of both of our times . You never married , did you ? You don 't expect me to answer rhetorical questions ? No . - Tell me about your relationship with Jarod . - Why don 't you tell me ? All right . I think he 's taken the role of a son you never had . What are your feelings for him ? You 're doing so well . Don 't stop now . I think you loveJarod very much . And I think you 'd do almost anything to protect him . But I 'm curious , off the record . How do you live with yourself ... knowing that you abducted a child from his family ? [ Sydney On TV ] I was not involved in Jarod 's abduction . [ Curtis ] Oh , yes . But once it happened , you did nothing about it . You had no problem ? No twinge of conscience , uh , about robbing him of his chance to live a normal life ? I didn 't have a choice . [ Curtis ] Didn 't you ? I had to do what I was told . - By whom ? - The same person who tells you what to do . Exactly . So we both know that you hold Mr. Raines personally responsible ... for the destruction ofJarod 's life . And we also know that killing Raines ... would give you a deep sense of satisfaction . It 's only human nature . I abhor violence . Well , but that doesn 't mean , given a strong enough motivation ... that you wouldn 't stoop to it . I think we 're done , Doctor . Doctor . [ Roger ] Don 't look so sad . It 's a comic book , man . You know , comic ? Fun ? This Spider-Man - He 's a fascinating superhero . Yet beneath all his heroics , he 's led a very sad life . He never knew his parents . He feels responsible for his uncle 's death . And people are always trying to kill him . Curse of the superhero . It 's tragic , really . Peter Parker didn 't have a real problem . Now , She-Hulk - her life was tragic . - [ Mouthing Words ] - Glad you guys are here . Check your speed scores . - The condemned move faster heading to the gallows . - [ All Groan ] Looks like we 're gonna be in for more drilling . You got that right . Jarod , work with Roger Saturday morning . Joellen , you and Bobby in the afternoon . Let me switch with Jarod . I have plans for Saturday . Change ' em . No one 's faster with the rope than Bobby . - That 's where you need improvement . - Just think . You can stay ... in bed late on Saturday and get some extra beauty sleep - not that you need it . [ Scoffs ] No , I 'm serious , Cap . Let me switch . I 'm serious too . No . Now come on . We got more sunshine to spread . See ya later . - [ Jarod ] What 's Chris working with ? - A bungee cord . - It helps strengthen his muscles . - Very clever . - A rubber band with hooks . - That 's the concept . What are his chances for recovery ? Too soon to say . But I 'm an optimist . He could regain a good portion ofhis cognitive and motor skills . Has he been able to communicate anything about his fall ? No . There 's been some improvement with his pre - and posttraumatic amnesia ... but still , no indication that he has any memory of the accident . There must have been some damage to his frontal lobe . More than likely , he never had time to encode the event into his long-term memory . You don 't know about bungee cords ... but you know about Dearling 's theory on shock trauma ? I used to moonlight as a psychological reconstructionist . - Wh - - And I read his file . - It says here that Chris landed on his back . - That 's right . Now , the hematoma on his 12th thoracic vertebra ... would indicate that he fell on something . The paramedics didn 't note it . I would have expected his injuries to be more severe . A fall from four stories . That 's usually fatal . Were you a triage surgeon too ? Only until I became a rodeo clown . No ! No . No ! [ Groans ] [ Groaning ] [ Spencer ] Hey . ! I want to hear something that loud ... I 'll stick a gun in my mouth ! Hey . I 'm sorry . I just fell off a building . Hey , wait up . I want to talk to you for a second . [ Spencer ] Don 't you have anything better to do at 3 : 00 a.m. ? - It 's 7 : 00 a.m. - Yeah . The noise pollution gets worse every day . Well , if you 're so concerned about the noise ... - why don 't you move into a shelter ? - Hey , hey . A poet needs freedom to create . This ... is freedom . [ Laughs ] - Wow . - Yeah . The only drawback is the noise . Forcing me towards haiku . Were you here writing your poetry the day that the man fell from the building ? Ooh , yeah . Yeah . Um - You see , I was flowin ' a rhyme ... and all of a sudden I heard somebody screaming , " No ! Don 't ! No ! Don 't ! " Kind of like what you were doing . And then - And then boom ! After a little while , all hell broke loose . Sirens and ambulances and cops . I tell you . My creativity was shot for the day . I 've seen the police report . There 's no mention that you ever told the police what you heard . No , no . See , I didn 't tell the cops . I told one of you rescue guys . - Who ? - I don 't know . I mean , this guy , he - he came up , and he said , " Sorry about the noise " ... gave me 20 bucks and , uh , told me to get a hot meal . - Now , that , my friend , was poetic . - What did he look like ? With all the gear and helmets and everything ... all you guys look the same . [ Chuckles ] Oh , hey . Hey . Uh , you know what ? He had some sort of fancy money clip . Uh , it had sort oflike a - a spiderweb design right in the middle of it . Watermelon , right ? Yeah . That 's , uh , what we call ' em here on Earth . It 's tonight 's dessert . Why are you banging on them ? I 'm not banging . I 'm , uh , thumpin ' . How do you tell if a watermelon 's ripe ? I don 't know . I 've never eaten one . Well , Starman , you 're definitely in for a treat . We 're all chipping ' in . So , uh , you owe me five bucks . - [ Jarod ] Five bucks , huh ? - How you doin ' ? - I actually don 't have any cash on me . - Come on . - Hey , man . Nobody gets out of paying ' . - What 's the matter ? - Mommy didn 't give you any lunch money today ? - Something like that . - Can you cover me ? - Yeah . - Pay me back , right ? - Of course I will . If we can 't trust each other , who can we trust ? Right . [ Keyboarding ] [ Beep ] [ Beep ] [ Clears Throat ] - I got word that you , uh - - Come in . Sit . [ Chuckles ] Cute kids . I 've been looking over your file . - There 's a letter in here - - You . Let 's go . from a Mrs. Mosely . My fourth grade teacher ? How far back does that thing go ? Letter 's addressed to your mother . Apparently , Mrs. Mosely was concerned for your safety at school . Why was that ? Well , you know how kids are . You know , they like to pick on the egghead . Do you remember what it felt like to be picked on ? Yes . I guess . Uh , you know , if I think about it . [ Man ] You 're next . So , did you ever attempt to defend yourself ... against those bullies ? - [ Door Closes ] - Bullies ? Oh , no . Actually , uh , no . I - I learned to outsmart them . What about today ? How do you respond to people who pick on you today ? - No one bullies me . - Really ? I was under the impression that Miss Parker often takes you to task . - She likes to tease me . Friends do that . - Oh , so you two are friends . Well - Uh , well , wait . No , wait a minute . Um , not - not exactly . Let 's go . How does Mr. Raines treat you ? Huh ? Mr. Raines ... always , um , has treated me fairly . With , uh-With great respect . That 's very interesting . Because it says in here that you 've been overheard ... disparaging him on more than one occasion . That-That 's - That 's a flat-out lie . Who said that ? I 'd like to know who said that . Uh , that would be , uh , Mr. Raines . It must eat you up ... knowing that people have picked on you your whole life , and you 've always had to take it . Never getting to even the score . I mean , how long will you let people ... demean and belittle you ... until you finally say , " Enough ! It ends here ! " How much humiliation can you take ? I know what you 're trying to do . You 're trying to get inside my head . Stir it up a little bit . Well , it 's not gonna work . You , let 's go . - But I want to stay here . - Hey ! Hey ! You ! Leave her alone ! What are they gonna do with her ? - What do you think ? They gonna hurt her ? - What are you - - The way Mr. Raines implied once he would do to your daughter ? - What do you want ? - The truth . ! - You want the truth ? I 'll give you the truth ! If anyone was ever to hurt my daughter - even try to - I 'd kill them . I don 't care who ! I 'd kill them . [ Phone Rings ] - Sydney . - How 's the book ? I still don 't know how Judge T. is gonna wrap this one up . How do you know ? You always used to sit down at your desk at 8 : 00 p.m. with a good book . - Does it still relax you ? - You know me too well . Hey , I can hear birds in the background . Must still be light where you are . You 're getting very good at this . I can also hear sadness in your voice . Guess you know me too well . I 've been thinking about my mother lately - what it 's going to be like when we finally meet . - Go on . - Well , it 's - it 's just that we 've been separated for so long . Will she s - Never mind . Everyone wants to believe a mother 's love is absolute . Sadly , that 's not always the case . Did your mother love you ? Yes , I believe she did . But know this : If a mother rejects her offspring ... rarely does the blame fall upon the child . It 's usually an indication that the woman does not love herself . Thank you , Sydney . Hey . I told you to leave me alone . This will help when the methadone doesn 't . You were at the free clinic getting your daily dose . But methadone - it doesn 't stop the craving for heroin . It only replaces it . That 's why you keep getting the sweats . Your body 's screaming for relief . Are you a junkie ? No , but I was a congressional adviser on drug policy for a while . Scout 's honor . This is ogden root . It 's an organic herb . It has a great calming effect . Friends of mine , they harvest it in Oregon . Trust me . It works . Oh , damn it ! Is this Chris ? Yes . When he was 11 years old . His papa sent it to me at a halfway house . It 's odd to be carrying around a picture of someone you 're trying to forget . I 'm not trying to forget . It 's just better if we don 't see each other . Is that why you went to the hospital ? I checked the sign-in sheet in intensive care . You didn 't think people would recognize your maiden name . They told me Chris was in a coma . They didn 't know if he was gonna live or not . I just did what any mother would do . I went to see my son . I didn 't have the strength to open the door . This is my mother . I only remember seeing her once . I don 't know much about her ... but I do know that I would give anything to feel her arms around me . Listen , if you ju - If you 're gonna tell me that Chris needs me and that the past doesn 't matter , save it . I 've always been a great addict , but I 'm worthless as a mother ! Grace , you 're a person with a disease . A disease that controlled your life . It kept you from the people that you love . But somewhere you found the courage to fight it . Maybe if you look there again , you 'll find what it takes to make things right with your son . Hey . Joellen . Where is everybody ? - They 're around somewhere . - Really ? That 's funny , ' cause I only saw your car ... - in the parking lot . - Yeah . Please , Bobby . I have work to do . - The captain assign that to you ? - Yes . - And he wants it done before he comes in . - Oh . I guess that means when I make captain , you 'll do exactly what I say , huh ? Don 't . I don 't like games . You 'll never guess what I just found . Hey , Jarod . I didn 't , uh - I didn 't see your car outside . - I took the bus . - Oh . A seedless watermelon . Now , I wonder how they get them out . Yeah . Listen , I , uh - I got some work I gotta do . I 'll , uh , talk to you later . - If I 'm tired , you must be exhausted . - Why ? Well , not only do you have to work and train all day like the rest of us ... but you have to put up with him . What do you mean ? The looking over your shoulder . The constant wondering when he 'll show up . What he 'll want . The rage , the powerlessness . I know that it would eat at me until I wanted to scream . At first , it seemed like harmless flirting . I thought I could handle it - handle Bobby . But ... he 's so aggressive . He scares me . Being the only woman , you must have felt trapped . Well , I knew if I complained through command , I would get nothing but flack . Bobby would only deny it , and I 'd become the black sheep of the squad . If I wasn 't fired . Believe me , it 's hard enough being one of the boys around here . So , I just kept my mouth shut . And then Chris found out ? Oh . One night . Well - Bobby touched me . And I was upset . Chris comforted me . He was such a great guy , you know . As if dealing with his own problems wasn 't enough ... he wanted to take care of me too . He was really angry with Bobby . He even wrote up a report , but , you know , I couldn 't sign it . Well , you should have . You 're not the first woman to feel this way . Bobby 's done this before . In Portland . He almost lost his job . His wife nearly left him . But he intimidated the victim until she dropped the charges . I don 't know . He 's connected , Jarod . Bobby 's about to become captain . Even if I take him on , he 'll win . Don 't be so sure . [ Curtis ] Thank you for coming , Miss Parker . I realize this interview is unpleasant . Just know that my intention is to eliminate people as possible suspects ... not incriminate them . Considering I 'm on record as having threatened to shoot Raines ... I would think I 'm your number one suspect . And I suppose we 're having this meeting in my father 's former office ... because Raines thinks it will unnerve me . I 'm not sure I know what you mean . My father has disappeared , and some Ralph Reed clone has replaced him . Exactly what part of this is hard to grasp , Doctor ? Let 's move on . Now , you 've known Jarod since you were a little girl . What 's your relationship with him now ? My relationship ... is to find him and bring him back . Preferably alive , but dead 's becoming more acceptable . So , it wouldn 't have bothered you if Mr. Raines had shotJarod ? Not at all . Mind if I smoke ? You make no effort at all to conceal your hostility towards Mr. Raines . Is that because you felt protected by your father ? I don 't need Daddy to protect me from Scar Man . Would you care to expand on that ? I think he was involved in the death of my mother ... and knows what happened to my father . What makes you think that ? Woman 's intuition . So it 's safe to say it would give you great satisfaction to see him dead ? It would give me great satisfaction to perform his autopsy ... before he was dead . Miss Parker , when you came in here ... I had no opinion one way or the other as to your involvement ... in the shooting of Mr. Raines . However , you must admit your excessive candor - [ Gasps , Groans ] If I 'd shot you , you son of a bitch ... you 'd be dead . Are we clear ? Hey , poet . Do you like watermelon ? - [ Knocking ] - [ Bobby ] Yeah ? 911 . We 've got a bridge worker stuck on a scaffold . When are these morons gonna learn ? Where is everybody ? - Just you and me . - Let 's do it . [ Siren Wailing , Stops ] Looks like a heart attack . I 'm goin 'over . Not this time , Spider-Man . I 'm in charge here . I 'm goin ' over . Okay . Feed me some line . Nice and easy . Nice and easy . A little more line . What are you doin ' ? I need more rope . Okay . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Jarod ! Jarod ! Hey ! Hey ! Stop . ! Are you crazy ? Just making sure that you 're still high enough . - For what ? - Your fall . What the hell are you doing ? Yep . That 'll work . See ya , Bobby . Jarod . ! Jarod . ! [ Screams ] Hey . ! Hey . ! [ Groans ] What the hell are you doing ? What you did . To Chris Welman . When he threatened to expose ... - your sexual harassment ofJoellen . - What ? - Hey , what kind of sick joke is this ? - Oh , this is no joke , Bobby . - At least I 'm not laughing . - You don 't know what you 're talking about , man . - You had to stop him . You had your promotion to lose . - No , man . So you followed Chris Welman up to the training tower , and you cut his rappelling rope . And then you made it look like he tried to commit suicide . That 's a lie , man ! The man left a note ! Which you wrote on his computer . Now , if it makes you feel any better , I 'll write one on yours . Jarod , please ! Look , all right ! All right ! I cut his rope ! I did it , all right ? Now , please . ! Just pull me back up out ofhere , man . ! Hmm . No way . No ! No ! [ Screams ] Now that was poetic ! Whoo ! [ Raines ] It 's about time , Dr. Curtis . Have you reached a conclusion ? - Yes . - And your determination ? Any one of them could have done it . Not very satisfying , Doctor . I 'm very sorry , Mr. Raines . That is the only conclusion I can come to , based on my evaluations . Get out . Perhaps Mr. Parker knows who pulled the trigger . Wherever he is . [ Bottle Rattles ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] I did what you wanted . I told him it could have been any one of them . This is who I believe actually shot him . So , we 're even . For now . [ Woman On P.A. ] Wheelchair to Admitting . Wheelchair to Admitting . Is there any progress ? Seems to vary with his mood . If we can find a way to keep his spirits up ... there 's a good chance Chris can regain as much as 80 % ... of his cognitive and motor skills . [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Vocalizing ] Mom . Mom . I love you , Mom . I love you too , Jarod .

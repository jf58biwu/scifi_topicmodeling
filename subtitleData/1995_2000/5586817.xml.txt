 A Head in the Polls NARRATOR : You 're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location . A place you might find a monster or weird mirror . These are examples . It could be much better . Prepare to enter The Scary Door . Per your request , please find enclosed the last man on earth . Finally , solitude . I can read books for all eternity . It 's not fair . It 's not fair ! Wait , my eyes aren 't that bad . I can read the large print books . It 's not ... ! Well , lucky I can read braille . Hey , look , a weird mirror . Cursed by his own hubris . A debate 's on ! Change the channel ! That 's what Fry said when we turned on the debate . TV ANNOUNCER : C - Span 9 presents " The Thrill of Politics . " [ SNORING ] There are no car chases but one of these men will become president of the world . So ? We live in the United States . That 's part of the world . I have been gone a long time . It 's time someone had the courage to say : " I 'm against things everybody hates . " I respect my opponent . He 's a good man . But frankly , I agree with everything he just said ! These candidates sound like clones . Wait , they are clones ! Even with identical DNA , they differ on key issues . Your three-cent titanium tax goes too far ! Your three-cent titanium tax doesn 't go too far enough ! If I were registered , I 'd send a message by staying home on election day , dressed like a clown . - You 're not registered ? - Not vaccinated , either . One vote never made a difference . The first robot president won by exactly one vote . John Quincy Adding Machine . He enticed voters by pledging not to go on a killing spree . But , like most , he promised more than he could deliver . One vote can make a difference and even though it won 't , you 're going to register . Yes , that 's a capital idea ! Let 's all go register . When did you care about voting ? The very instant I became old . The problem is , both parties give your tax dollars to the less fortunate . They get all the breaks ! You could join a third party , maybe . Only weirdos and mutants join third parties . I 'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting . - What 's your party , Bender ? - I can 't vote . - Because you 're a robot ? - No , a felon . We favor huge subsidies to the Brain Slug planet . Okay , but what are the Brain Slugs gonna do for the working man ? - Attach Brain Slugs to them . - Sure , you say that now . Is it true you can make shirts and rope out of hemp ? Dave 's not here , man . - I heard hemp makes great shampoo . - It does ? No way ! I gotta check out this brochure . What are you doing to protect my right to bear doomsday devices ? We 'll get rid of the three-day waiting period for mad scientists . Today , the mad scientist can 't get a doomsday device tomorrow , the mad grad student . Where will it end ? Amen ! I don 't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax for duck hunting . Sure , humans are cute but how will we test cosmetics ? I concur . Here 's a party to get excited about . Sign me up . Not with that attitude . - Okay , screw it . - Welcome aboard , brother ! - All right ! - You 're out . I 'm actually getting interested in politics . [ SNORING ] With two weeks left , the question is who will be the next president of Earth ? Jack Johnson , or bitter rival , John Jackson ? Terrific candidates , huh , Morbo ? All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo . Disaster struck on Saturn ' s moon , Titan when a titanium mine collapsed , trapping 1 000 robot workers . Good lord ! Without a quick response , the robots will die within 300 years . What rescue operations are planned ? We 'll pave over the area , then move on . The news sent titanium prices skyrocketing . - I 'm rich ! - What do you mean ? My body 's 40 percent titanium . I 'm finally richer than those snooty ATMs . - Too bad you can 't spend it . - Oh , can 't I ? - No . - Watch me , poor man . MAN : Pleasure doing business with you . [ BENDER LAUGHS ] Game 's over , losers . I have all the money . Compare your lives to mine , and then kill yourselves . Hey , get away ! You get five dollars to not do what you 're thinking about . You just lost five dollars . Hey , buddy , little help ? Thank you ! Hello , peasants . What happened to you ? Yeah , did you get a haircut ? No , I sold my body ! Sold your body ? Bender , I 've been down that road . It 's glamorous , the parties are great but you 'll spend every dollar on jewelry and skintight pants . How are you gonna live without a body ? Bodies are for hookers and fat people . All I need is a wad of cash with a head . - Now you can pay off your loan shark . - What 's he gonna do , break my legs ? This is the life . Another martini , please ? Shaken , not stirred . Yeah ! Put it all on black . Ooh ! Ah ! Ouch ! Oh ! 21 red . I beg your pardon , 33 black . Yes ! The rich get richer ! Strike ! In your face , Leela ! Ow ! Timber ! Can I ride in your car ? No , it looks like your neck stepped in something . Oh , I 'm sorry , that 's just your body . Look me in the shins and say that ! I 've had it up to here with this place . I 'm off to hang out with classy heads like me , who appreciate poetry , philosophy , hats . So long , coffin stuffers ! Could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me ? Which group of heads is good enough for me ? What do you think , Fry ? Fry ? Hi , I 'm Claudia Schiffer 's head . I recognize you . Didn 't you have a body ? Yeah , but it was holding me back . I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swim Cap Issue . Well , you 're looking great . - I 'd like to lose a few pounds . - Couldn 't hurt . Ah , U.S. presidents . Sturdy shelves , good security . This place has class . Hi , sugar . Legally , nothing I can do counts as sex anymore . I apologize . He gets this way around meaty-Iooking women . I remember you . I was gonna vote for you . But voting isn 't cool , so I got trashed on Listerine . I 've never felt voting is essential to the process . No kidding , Ford . So the hooker-bot says , " That 's not my expansion slot " and my friend says , " That 's not my 25-pin connector ! " Bender , thou robots really cracketh me up . I like it here . What 's the rent for a jar ? Sorry , we can 't let every Tom , Dick and Harry move in . No offense , Jefferson , Nixon and Truman . How about the closet of presidential losers ? Bob Dole needs company . LaRouche won 't stop telling jokes . - Pass . - What hath happened to your body ? - I hocked it . - Why wouldst thou do that ? - Same reason you hocked your teeth . - Ah , booze money . I remember my body : Flabby , pasty-skinned , riddled with phlebitis . A good Republican body . God , I loved it . I spent my teen years loving my body . Of course , it was tough love ... He opened relations with China . He doesn 't care about your ding-dong . Even if you miss your body , being a head 's great too ? No , son . It 's a sad and lonely life . Great ! Now you tell me . That 's my style . Kick them when they 're down . Ones , zeros one , one , zero , zero , one ... - Bender , what is it ? - What an awful dream . Ones and zeros everywhere ! And I thought I saw a two . It was just a dream . There are no twos . I know what 's wrong . My body loved me , and I turned its back on it . Well , old friend , tie a yellow ribbon round your neck . I 'm coming home ! You sold my body ! To who ? I can 't reveal that . But I 'll give you $ 50 for the kid . - My clothes are worth 50 bucks . - Deal . How could I let this happen ? I can 't go through life like this ! - What about your self-destruct button ? - It 's on my body ! What am I gonna do ? I can 't stand to see a robot cry . Let 's watch TV . And so , ladies and gentlemen , I 'm throwing my head into the ring . I 'm announcing my candidacy for the Presidency of Earth ! Sir , the Constitution states nobody can be elected president more than twice . That 's right , no " body . " But , as you can plainly see , I 've got a shiny new body . Bender , he 's got your body ! That double-crossing bastard ! How dare he run off with Nixon ! - He must have bought your body . - And that electric guitar . Remember What the Doormouse said Feed your head I 'm meeting you halfway , you stupid hippies . I am not a crook 's head . Yeah , you are ! You stole my body . Fry , Leela , you gotta help me . Ordinarily I 'd say no , and how it 's your fault for being an idiot . But when a robotic Nixon is loose , we have to take action ! Idiot . Morbo will introduce the candidates . Puny human number one . Puny human number two . And my good friend , Richard Nixon . Hello , Morbo . How 's the family ? Belligerent and numerous . Good man . Nixon 's pro-war and pro-family . [ AUDIENCE APPLAUDS ] First he steals my body , now he 's touching my stuff . We 've got to find a way to talk to him . Morbo demands an answer to the following question : If you saw candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and eat it ? Unthinkable ! Wouldn 't think it ! What about you , Mr. Nixon ? You are under a truth-o-scope . Uh , well , I , uh ... . The question is vague . You don 't say what kind of candy , whether anyone is watching ... . I certainly wouldn 't harm the child . You scored big points . What ? They ate me alive out there . But your body 's message was , " Look at my shiny new body . " You 've got real charisma from the neck down . Nixon with charisma ? My God , I can rule the universe ! Give my body back , you thief ! Look here , you drugged-out communist . I paid for this body and I 'd no sooner return it than I would my dog . Shut up ! Please , we 're appealing to your sense of decency . Seriously , I 'm never giving back this body . Beat it ! Or I 'll get Cambodian on your asses ! It 's hopeless . We might as well turn in my head for the five-cent deposit . My best friend 's not getting recycled ! Not for five cents , not for 500 cents . - I have a plan . - I have a better plan . Why would Nixon stay here ? You get a discount if you 've been here before . FRY : Keep going . We 're right behind you . Whoa , mama . Get a room , you two ! MAN : We 're in a room ! - Then lose some weight ! [ SNORING ] Oh , yeah . You women 's libbers really know how to party . Pssst . There I am . Hey , Betty Friedan , send a little of that lotion my way . Okay . Almost got it . Steady . Steady . Don 't panic . Oooh ! Uh-oh . What the ... ? - You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve . - I want what 's mine ! - Don 't make me kick your neck . - Bring it on , soup can . Break it up , you two ! That 's it ! You 're going to jail ! And I don 't grant pardons like that sissy , Ford . You won 't pardon anyone , because you won 't get elected . The voters aren 't pea-brained idiots anymore . No ? Listen here , missy . Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1 973 but voters are as drunk and stupid as ever ! The only one who 's changed is me . I 've become bitter and crazy . Once I 'm in office , I 'll sell our children 's organs to zoos for meat ! I 'll go into people 's houses at night and wreck up the place ! He lost my vote . One vote won 't make a difference . Excuse me , while I inch myself over to the phone and call the police . Not so fast , Nixon ! Are you familiar with audio tape ? [ TAPE REWINDS ] Uh-oh . I don 't like where this is heading . I 'll go into people 's houses at night and wreck up the place ! I really sound like that ? I thought I had a Clark Gable quality . We 'll trade you the tape for the body . Oh , expletive deleted ! You 've got a deal . Hey , I 've got one last thought . It 's good to be back in one piece again except for these damn bumper stickers . The sheer drama has driven turnout to its highest level in centuries six percent ! Exit polls show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with zero votes . Yes , the system works ! The time is 7 : 59 , and the robot polls are opening . The robot vote is in . Nixon has won ! - No ! - Get out of town ! Why 'd they vote for him , now that he 's just a head ? I give you the next president of Earth ! Nixon 's back ! [ CROWD CHEERS ] I can 't believe it . He won by a single vote . It ain 't my fault . I 'm a non-voting felon . It 's not my fault . I forgot to vote . Crud , I knew there was something I meant to do today . Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president . May death come quickly to his enemies . Who 's kicking who around now ? Knock knock .

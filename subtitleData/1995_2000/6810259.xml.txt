 " We 've given your grievances a lot of consideration . " " No . Don 't think you 're not expendable . " He never once said I was doing a good job . All my hard work ... Nobody ever stuck up for me . They were all treated special . Nobody moves ! Everybody stays ! Shut up ! I said shut up ! Now , listen to me , everyone . Listen to me . OK , the children can go . Everybody else ... Nobody moves . - We need the police , quick . - I said nobody else moves . Please don 't harm anyone . Get away . I 'll shoot . - You 're frightening these people . - I 'll do it . Hey ! I will do it . They 've done nothing to you . Oh , you don 't know . Give me the gun . - I am not a loser . - No , you 're not . They made me do it . They made me . But you 're not going to do it . You 're gonna show them . You 're gonna show them . No ! - I 'm gonna die . - Nobody 's going to die . All right , folks , clear . Move back . Move back now . Where are the wounded ? FBI . Where are the people who were shot ? Everybody 's inside . But you aren 't gonna find any wounded . You the first medic on the scene ? What happened ? It doesn 't make sense . We got a call that there 'd been a shooting . One man down . But when we got here , there wasn 't a damn thing to do . I 'm Agent Scully . I wanna talk to somebody who can tell me what happened . I can say what I saw . But I don 't think there 's a man here who can tell you what happened . - What did you see ? - Maybe you should talk to this man . He was one of the ones shot . - You were shot ? - Right here . Right in the stomach . I felt the bullet enter me , and the next thing I remember was being on the floor . My legs and arms were numb and I could taste blood in my throat . - Then I see the man 's face . - What man ? It was the same guy who tried to talk the gun guy out of hurting anyone . - What did he do ? - He touched me . And he said I was gonna be OK . And then , all of a sudden , I could feel my legs and arms again . - Who are you ? - My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm an FBI agent . I understand you 've been read your rights . Will you talk to me , Mr Muntz ? Can you tell me what happened ? God ... spared my life today . He took pity on my soul and he washed away my sins . How do you mean ? He reached down and he healed me with his hand . With the palm of his hand . - Who did ? - A man . A holy man . All I can think is ... it must have been the good Lord himself . - Did you talk to him ? - Who ? The shooter described a man who healed him with the palm of his hand . - He 's gone . - They let him leave the scene ? He was in custody and they were talking to him and then , somehow , he just disappeared . - He just vanished ? - Without a trace . It struck me as I was sitting here . What ? Everything changes but the sea . - What do you want from me ? - I thought we might at least reminisce . I have nothing to say to you . Really ? We used to have so much to say to each other . So many good times at the Mulders ' summer place . Your kids , young and energetic . I remember water-skiing down there with Bill . He was a good water-skier , your husband . Not as good as I was , but then ... .. that could be said about so many things . Couldn 't it ? I 've repressed it all . Well ... I find that hard to believe . Particularly since I 've come here today to ask you to remember something . Something I 'm gonna have to ask you to try very hard to recollect . He gave his name as Jeremiah Smith of Suitland , Virginia . He gave a PO box that 's a phoney . And he had no driver 's licence . All the cars have been accounted for ? Yeah . He must have walked from somewhere nearby . - We 've got a canvass up . - You talked to him ? Yeah . Damnedest thing . And I swear this is how it happened . I look down at my notebook to write something . I look up . The guy 's not standing there any more . It was like he just disappeared . Thank you . Mulder . Agent Mulder , this is Assistant Director Skinner 's office . Please hold for a second . Agent Mulder ? I just received a call here that might cause you some alarm . What is it ? Your mother 's been admitted to a hospital , in serious condition , in a town called Quono ... Quonochontaug ? I 'm on my way . The nurse said she had a stroke . They don 't yet know the nature or severity of it , but the doctor 's on his way down . She 's cold . Mulder , I don 't wanna jump to conclusions . I don 't want you to think the worst . People recover from these situations all of the time . Mom ... She hasn 't been able to speak . She 's been in and out of consciousness . - How did she get here ? - A 91 1 call came in . The paramedics from Shelter Harbor found her on the floor of the house . Mom ... Hi . It 's OK . Everything 's gonna be OK . - What is it ? What do you want ? - I think she wants something to write on . " Palm " ? She 's had what 's called a subarachnoid haemorrhage . But they 're very hopeful because the circulation was restored so quickly . She 's gonna be under constant supervision and the best care in the hospital . It could be a lot worse . Thanks . Are you OK ? Yeah . I 'm , um ... - I can 't help thinking there 's a correlation . - Correlation ? A connection to the shootings at the fast-food restaurant . - I 'm sorry , I don 't understand . - My mother wrote the word " palm " . That 's what the man who healed the victims , that 's what he used - the palm of his hand . - You think it 's a leap ? - Mulder , there 's no deep mystery here . Your mother is at the right age for something like this to happen . - But why the word " palm " ? - There could be several reasons . But , to be honest , I don 't think it means anything . Her brain and her thought processes have been radically changed by what 's happened . It could very well have affected her centre of speech , her language . But you can 't explain it exactly . Nor can it be explained how the wounded were healed ... .. or how the man who healed them just vanished into thin air , can it ? I 'm sure it can . And will be . I 'm gonna drive you to the nearest motel . It 's been a very long day . I wanna go back to DC . - To do what ? - I wanna find out who this miracle man is . This is everything shot by the first news crew on the scene . - Outtakes and unedited footage . - Did they get any tape of the man ? Yeah . It 's supposed to be at about 8.22 . There . That must be him . - What happened there ? - Yeah , he 's gone . Where did he go ? - You see that ? - Yeah . It 's like he 's gone , but there 's ... somebody else in his place , wearing the same clothes . - Could that be another detective ? - Why don 't you find out ? Where are you going ? If I told you , you 'd never let me go . Mulder , you haven 't slept in almost 24 hours . Call me if you find anything . He was here with her . - What ? - With your mother . - The cancer man . - What are you talking about ? Maybe I can bring you up to speed , Agent Mulder . - Did you take these ? - They had quite an argument . As you might gather from the snapshots . You seem surprised . Surely you were aware they knew each other ? - Or what brought them here together ? - I don 't know . - Did he hurt her ? - No . No , she collapsed after he left . I dare say if I hadn 't been here to make the call , she might not have survived . - What did they argue about ? - I don 't know . I kept a discreet distance . You had some idea , or you wouldn 't have been here . He wants something from her . Something she may have kept in this house . Unless you know another reason they would have chosen to meet here . The day my parents divorced , she vowed never to set foot in the summer house again . I know my mother . She kept her word . It could be something very old . - Certainly something very important . - I have no idea what that could be . - No idea at all ? - No . - Sir ? Excuse me . - Yes ? - Are you Jeremiah Smith ? - Yes . I 'm afraid there 's been some mistake . I saw my photo on the news saying I fled a crime scene . I 'm here to turn myself in . Would you come with me , sir ? From the moment I stepped out and asked the man to put down his gun , it seemed like ... .. a dream . As if I was out of my body . There were reports , somewhat fantastic reports , about what happened next . I know . I saw the news reports . I 'll have to say that I don 't remember any of it . Nothing . You gave me a wrong address . You left the crime scene during the interview . - I don 't remember that . I 'm sorry . - What do you remember , Mr Smith ? I remember showing up for work the next day , being at my desk . That 's my first recollection . At the Social Security Administration ? I 'm not sure what I 've done wrong . You haven 't done anything wrong , sir . May I go ? Yes . But until this matter is resolved completely , ... .. I 'd ask that you notify us if you 'll be out of town for any reason . Agent Scully ? This becomes a responsibility . A thing I 'm now called upon to put right and put down . - Certainly you expected nothing less . - I 'm not ashamed of my actions . Ashamed ? You 're not allowed the luxury of human weakness and penitence , ... .. not allowed to put your indulgences ahead of the greater purpose . I no longer believe in the greater purpose . - Then your fate is just . - My justice is not for you to mete out . You may have reason . You have no right . - You have no means , either . - You presume to dictate duty to me ? Have you any idea what the cost of your actions is ? What their effect might be ? Who are you to give them hope ? - What do you give them ? - We give them happiness . And they give us authority . The authority to take away their freedom under the guise of democracy . Men can never be free because they 're weak , ... .. corrupt , worthless and restless . The people believe in authority . They 've grown tired of waiting for miracle and mystery . Science is their religion . No greater explanation exists for them . They must never believe any differently if the project is to go forward . At what cost to them ? The question 's irrelevant , and the outcome inevitable . The date is set . At what cost to them for your own selfish benefit ? How many must die at your hand to preserve your stake in the project ? I 'm not impressed by your miracles or moved by your trickery . Your justice will be meted out . By whom this time ? And by what tool ? By those who possess the tool of your destruction . Hold his calls . I want his name . I wanna know everything about him . I want the smoking man smoked out . I want him exposed as a murdering son of a bitch . - What ? - Where have you been ? Our summer house . He 's the reason for what happened to my mother . Where 'd you get these ? All that matters is that he 's called to answer . - I want his name ! You know how to get it ! - These men don 't have names ! Then you tell me how to find him . There was a time when I might have been able to tell you , but that time has passed . He knows about the man from the restaurant shooting . - What are you talking about ? - He 's tryin ' to kill him . He came in yesterday . - He turned himself in . - What ? - He gave a statement . - Where is he now ? He works for the Social Security Administration . Jeremiah Smith ? - Mr Smith ? - Hello . I 'm with the FBI . I 'd like you to come with me . For what ? I told you everything I know . I thought they said you 'd call if there was anything . I 'm sure you don 't wanna cause a scene at work . No , of course not . I 'll come along . - Can you tell me where you 're taking me ? - We 'll have plenty of time to talk , sir . - You see him ? - No , I lost him . It 's only a matter of time now . You put me in a cage within a cage . - Why are you so afraid of me ? - I 'm not . Yes , you are . You live in fear . That 's your whole life . - You don 't know anything about me . - I know everything about you . You think the miracles I perform are the extent of my power . You think you 're God . You 're a drone . A cataloguer . Chattel . What you 're afraid of is ... they 'll believe I am God . That doesn 't matter . Most of them have ceased to believe in God . Why ? God presents them with no miracles to earn their faith . You think when man ceases to believe in miracles , he rejects God ? - Of course . - You rule over them in God 's name . They don 't believe in him , but they still fear him . They 're afraid not to , because they 're afraid of freedom . And you give them happiness . We appease their conscience . Anyone who can appease a man 's conscience can take his freedom away from him . And if you can 't appease their conscience , you kill them . But you can 't kill them all . You can 't kill their love , which is what makes them who they are . Makes them better than us . Better than you . You talk ! I 'm not one of you . No . All you want is to be a part of it , ... .. is to be one of the commandants when the process begins . But you are wrong . Oh . - Am I ? - Yes . You are dying of lung cancer . - It 's a lie . - You think it 's a lie ? You wanna save your life . And you ? We had been hopeful , but there was substantial blood loss during the stroke , ... .. which has put a lot of pressure on the brain . - Will she regain consciousness ? - I know this is hard , but she may not . - I can be paged if you need me . - Thank you . Are you gonna smoke that or do you wanna smoke on this ? Are you giving me a choice ? I should shoot you here , but they 'd probably save you . Do it . Do it , Agent Mulder . Or maybe put a bullet through your brain so you 'll be bedridden like my mother ! - How is she ? - What do you care ? I 've known your mother since before you were born , Fox . I don 't care . - I 'd gone to see her recently . - Yeah . - And I know what you were looking for . - I wasn 't looking for anything . It 's what she was looking for , actually . She contacted me . - Liar ! - I had information , possibly . On the whereabouts of your sister . Where is she ? Where is she ? It seems the man who had the information has disappeared . - I have what you want . - There 's nothing I want , Agent Mulder . Except to see how your mother 's doing . How is Mrs Mulder ? Do you have it ? - Do you have it ? - Yes . - Give it to me . - I can 't do that . - It 's of no value to you . - And to you ? When the time comes , when the truth is finally determined , its value will soar . - Why ? - I think you know why , Agent Mulder . It 's a weapon , isn 't it ? Used to pierce the back of the neck . It 's the only way we can kill them . - A simple gunshot won 't do . - Why do you want it ? They will kill you for it , Agent Mulder . That 's a fact . They 'll stop at nothing for it , nothing . Even if they have to martyr you and risk turning your work into a crusade . Let me get clear on something here . What we 're talking about is colonisation . The date is set , isn 't it ? Give me the weapon , Agent Mulder . No . You shoot me and you 'll never find it . I oughta shoot you anyway . After everything I 've given you . I 'm walking ... away . You 're a dead man , Agent Mulder . One way or the other . - Who is it ? - Jeremiah Smith . Please let me in . I want you to put your hands up where I can see them . OK . I want you to keep your hands up . I 'm gonna unlock the door . I want you to count to five , come in , close the door and lock it behind you . Keep your hands up , please . I have important information for you , something your partner has been seeking . It concerns an elaborate plan , a project , and his sister . - Why didn 't you tell me before ? - I 've never spoken to you before . The man you spoke to was an impostor . He was sent here to kill me . - Who are you ? - I 'll explain everything . - Yeah . - Scully , it 's me . - Where are you ? - I 've been up with my mother . Listen ... Mulder , listen to me . There 's somebody here you need to talk to . - Who ? - Jeremiah Smith . Get out of your apartment . They 're looking for him . I want you to meet me . - Where ? - Off the I-95 . Bond Mill Road . Scully ! Scully , move away from him . Come stand behind me . I 've come to you at great risk . I mean you no harm . - I have a complicated story to tell you . - He knows about your sister . - How do I know you 're for real ? - I was at that restaurant . I healed people . - Yes , but how ? - I can explain everything to you . First I want you to come somewhere . I want you to come with me to see my mother . He 's here to kill me .

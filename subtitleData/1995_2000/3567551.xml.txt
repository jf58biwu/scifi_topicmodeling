 [ Miss Parker ] I swear to God , I 'm starting to lose my mind . It 's bad enough that we have missed Jarod ... with all the close calls that we 've had ... but we 're not even showing up in the right cities anymore . Well , we 'll get back on track , Miss Parker . We 're just in a slump . This is the Centre , Broots . We don 't have slumps . [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Rings , Beeps ] - What ? Well , well , well , long time no see . [ On Speakerphone ] And how is life treating you ? Like you caught me in bed with his wife . What do you want , Jarod ? - Why is Mr. Lyle tailing me ? - Mr. Lyle ? Yes . He chased me through Albuquerque and Santa Fe . Although I don 't see much hitchhiking in his future . - Hitchhiking ? - Somebody cut off one of his thumbs . Jarod ? I think you should tell us where you are . We can protect you from him . Although I really do appreciate your concern , I 've gotten used to taking care of myself . Well , I really gotta go . I 'm late for work . - Ciao . - [ Phone Beeps ] Hey , Joey . - Who 's this ? - [ Joey ] He 's the new guy . - So , are we set ? - My money . Bobby ? [ Foghorn Sounds In Distance ] It 's a beautiful thing , huh ? Plates will be here in three days . Take it easy . - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . - What 's this ? Hey ... it 's like a round peg in a square hole . You just don 't fit . Hey , Joey . A corpse means cops . Yeah , and a live witness means trouble . Sorry . I came through with the counterfeit plates . I got what you wanted . Come on , shoot him . It 's freezing in here . Joey , this ain 't smart . You know he 's right ? You do it . Come on , man . Show me what you got . Do it . Do it ! - [ Gun Cocks ] - Or I punch your ticket . They don 't call him Bobby " Two Guns " for nothing . - This ain 't right , Joey . - All right , all right . - But at least let me take him out to the docks . - No , no , no , do it here . Come on , Chicago boy . - Joey , I got kids . - Say a prayer for ' em . I got a family , Joey . I mean , come on . - No , don 't ! - Shoot him . Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - Breakfast ? - Yeah . Let 's get outta here . It stinks . Hey , quite the marksman there , sport . - [ Man ] The guy 's a natural born killer . - Nice shot . [ Man Laughs , Continues Indistinct ] [ Door Opens ] - Jarod . - What 's up ? Faye , how 'd we do last night ? I don 't know , Joey . Only about 900 and change . - What ? - It rained . All right , Bobby . Make sure this gets there by 10 : 00 , all right ? I don 't want another phone call . - I gotta pay the rent . - So pay it . Hey , hey , come here , babe . Hey , let 's talk in my office . I love what you 've done with the place . Feds can 't pick up a conversation because of the frost . Look . If this is about what happened yesterday , you caught me off guard . - It will never happen again . - That was just a test . [ Sniffs ] Now , you know , you 're definitely not making full use of all your talents . [ Sniffs ] In fact , Tony says you 're the best print man he 's ever seen . A " real artist , " he says . Well , you know , you print a man a million dollars , he 'll say anything . - So , show me . - Excuse me ? Come on . Let 's see what you got . Which one 's real ? [ Sniffing ] [ Chuckles ] They 're both real . Guess I 'm an artist . Did you really think I wouldn 't find out who you are ? Huh ? [ Gun Cocks ] - What the hell are you talking about ? - Just tell me again , huh ? Once again , what happened in Chicago ? I told you . I was a print man for Tony T. Yeah ? What 's this ? Look at this . " Jarod Puzo : Outstanding convictions for arson ... extortion , fraud , outstanding warrants . " - You want me to continue ? - All right , all right , all right . I jumped bail . I wanted to lay low for a little while . Last thing I needed was some punk making his bones by ratting ' me out . Okay . A few months back , a couple of feds infiltrated our organization . - Well , that 's no good . - Yeah , yeah . A friend of mine says they could subpoena everybody . Well , if you will remember , all that occurred before I got here . Yeah . Well , you got an answer to everything , don 't ya ? No more secrets , all right ... artist ? Your secretary said it was urgent . I got this surveillance tape off the satellite feed from our Hartford office . - [ Gunshots ] - [ People Groaning ] [ Miss Parker ] Oh , my God . Do you know the shooter ? - Follow me . - [ Mr. Parker ] I think we both do . [ Miss Parker ] Mr. Lyle . Jarod contacted us . He said Lyle 's been dogging him . Last report was he was dealing with a Japanese yakuza . Ah . [ Laughs ] Definitely yakuza . The yakuza punish by taking the little finger of the offending party . What 's a guy have to do to lose a thumb ? [ Mr. Parker ] It couldn 't happen to a nicer fella . Question is , now what 's the bastard up to ? Lyle knows all the Centre offices are monitored . He disabled the primary . These shots are from the backup units . Well , we know all our people there are dead ... including the executive administrator , Mr. Strum . Lyle . I want you to go to Hartford , clean up the mess . I 'm not a Cleaner anymore . Myjob is to find Jarod . You said Lyle was afterJarod . It makes this your job . Somebody has to find out what else he was after . Huh ? [ Clears Throat ] This is a ... very delicate situation . You 're the only person I can trust . [ Man ] Undercover agent Dean Clark was arraigned today ... in the killing of federal officer Lester Knight . A reporter caught up with Sean Flanagan ... the U.S. prosecutor who 's trying the case . [ Woman ] Is it the department 's contention that Dean Clark killed undercover agent Knight ? Agent Clark has been charged with homicide in connection with the death of a fellow agent ... while both were working undercover for the Melino crime family . That 's all this department has to say at this time . [ TVOff ] He 's the reason I joined RICO . I would never do anything to disgrace him . You said you were drinking with an associate ofJoey Melino 's ... the night that Les Knight was murdered . Yeah , Bobby " Two Guns , " Melino 's second in command . They call him " Two Guns " 'cause he carries these matching.38s. I told my lawyer this . Don 't you guys in the public defender 's office talk to each other ? - [ Buzzer , Door Opens ] - So you were with this Bobby ... the night that Agent Knight was murdered ? My assignment undercover was to tail Two Guns . He was hanging out at Faye 's restaurant ... and challenged me to go head-to-head with a bottle of gin . - So , I started drinking , B.S. ' ing . - [ Buzzer ] I get a call from Agent Knight . He says someone is feeding RICO information to Melino . - Did he say who ? - No . He said to watch my back and meet him in the morning . The same morning Agent Knight was found suffocated in a dry cleaner 's bag ? The same dry cleaners that you use . I was set up . Bobby and I polished off a quart of gin . I don 't even remember leaving Faye 's . There 's no way I could have driven over the bridge to Agent Knight 's ... kill him and make it back home without running my car into a pole . I 'm telling you . I was set up . [ Joey ] The counterfeit plates are coming in from Costa Rica . Two sizes , twenties and hundreds . They might need some work . You 're an artist . I 'm gonna need the right materials . - You know the suppliers ? - Of course . - But it 's gonna cost . - Hey , don 't worry about that . If this deal goes down , everybody 's gonna get fat . [ Man ] Hey , Joey , you got a call . - Who is it ? - I don 't know . You want me to ask ? No , just gimme the phone . Hey , Faye , bring me a Gibson . I 'll be right back . Is that Waikiki ? Yeah . Yeah , you can see Diamond Head in the background . I hear it 's beautiful . Supposed to go there on my honeymoon . - Got put off . - So , Faye ... what 's a nice girl like you doin ' in a place like this ? [ Laughs ] - I can 't afford to move to Hawaii . - Seriously . Why don 't you just sell this place and go ? [ Sighs ] Joey . He sucked this place dry . I 've got no equity . How 'd you link up with a guy likeJoey ? My husband died and left me the restaurant . I tried to make a go of it , but , uh , ran into some money trouble . - Joey said he could help . Ooh , big mistake . - [ Bobby ] Hey , Faye . ! Let 's go . ! You 're the one who should get away from him while you still can . - What happens to them ? - Nothing . They don 't exist anymore . Been a while since you 've worked as a Cleaner , Miss Parker . - I 'm surprised . - My father has his reasons . - What are we looking for ? - Anything that seems out of place or missing . Lyle wouldn 't pull off a hit like this unless it was important . There 's got to be something around here . What is this ? Oh , it 's an E-prong chip . - Most likely tied to the panel of the blue box . - Blue box ? Each Centre office has a dedicated hardware system from the mainframe ... called the blue box . But a chip like this just couldn 't fall off . - Blue boxes are sealed shut . - Like this ? Um , yeah , that would be it . What 's up ? Friend of a friend tells me that 10 pallets of raw currency paper ... are being stored in a warehouse in Brooklyn for one night . Tonight . Wow . You wanna rip off the Treasury Department ? We use Uncle Sam 's paper , no one , but no one ... is going to be able to tell our bills from the real deal . Hey , Picasso - he didn 't paint on toilet paper , did he ? Trust me . I say something funny ? " Trust me . " That 's the last thing that Lester Knight said to me ... standing right where you 're at . You snuffed that RICO cop here ? We locked him right where you 're standing . I thought he was gonna freeze to death , but he suffocated first . I lost 50 bucks to Two Guns on that bet . But , hey , dead is dead , right ? [ Chuckles ] I thought he had a dry cleaning bag wrapped around his head . I did that ... to frame that other RICO cop . I 'm an artist too , you know ? All right , Picasso , set it up . [ Bobby ] Gee , we got enough paper to print a billion bucks . - Hey , way to go , Picasso . - Yeah , baby . Security shifts change in 20 . Let 's move . Yeah . All right , we gotta go . The cops are coming . - How do you know this ? - Trust me , he knows . [ Bobby ] Come on , let 's move it . ! Come on . ! - Let 's go . - [ Sirens Wailing In Distance ] - Come on . Get outta here ! - Hands up ! Get ' em where I can see ' em . - Federal agents , you 're under arrest ! - Hold it right there . ! - Get on the ground ! - Get out of the truck . ! - Get on the ground . ! - Get your hands off of me ! [ Groaning ] - They 're taking Bobby downtown . - Did you have to get me in the nose ? At least you didn 't have to take a bullet . Vest or no vest ... I 'm gonna smell like cat food for at least a month . How long did you have to stay in that fish bath ? Let 's just say the dry cleaners don 't want my business anymore . No , no , no , leave them on . The more bruises , the less questions they 're gonna ask . Jarod , we put a lot of pressure on people in Chicago to vouch for you . If you thinkJoey 's getting wise , I 'll pull you out . We don 't wanna lose another undercover agent . No , I 'm too close to bail out now . So why 'd you set up this phony bust ? Melino seems to know everything before we do . I 'm looking for a leak . - And ? - And he gets a phone call . And he takes off before you guys get there . - Could be a coincidence . - No . There 's a rat on this ship , and it 's a big one . Look . This wasn 't a rag merchant you morons boosted . It was the U.S. Treasury Department . I told you already . We were going to meet some friends ... and we went to the wrong warehouse . Hey , Flanagan , we got a couple of wise guys playing brain dead . How can you tell ? Now who looks stupid ? Us , or the guys who lost two undercover cops ? You guys know what you 're looking at ? Hmm ? Twenty years . Funny , that 's what Dean Clark is looking at . Must have been a real disappointment for you fellas . You know what gets me up in the morning ? The chance of putting Joey Melino away forever . So , you guys can wisecrack all you want . This time I win . - The game 's not over yet . [ Clicks Tongue ] - [ Knocking ] [ Flanagan ] You can 't be serious . Melino 's lawyer is in Judge Drake 's chambers . Apparently somebody forgot to read these gentlemen their rights . - What ? - Whoops . - [ Flanagan ] Cut ' em loose . - Cut ' em loose ? You heard me . [ Makes Buzzer Sound ] Looks like this time you lose . Well , I ran a diagnostic . There 's definitely a circuit chip missing . But isn 't there any way of determining ... what sort of information was stored on it ? Uh , it 's impossible to know what was on it ... and more specifically what 's not . Nothing 's impossible . Keep working . So , what happened at the warehouse ? The friend of a friend who set it up - turns out he had a parole violation . So he 's playing both ends against the middle ... so he wouldn 't have to go back to stir . Look . I know things didn 't turn out 100 % ... but we got enough paper to make the score . And the friend of a friend ? Let 's just say that he won 't be talking to anyone anymore . And I 'm mailing his wife a little present . Is that a tongue ? Look . The paper we got , it 's good . So everything is gonna be okay . I 'm counting on it . - Uh , Bobby . - Yeah . - I got you something too . - What , the guy 's brains ? [ Chuckles ] Something better . A little congrats for getting out of jail . That is your drink , right ? Can you believe this guy ? - Thanks . - Don 't mention it . [ Mr. Parker ] All the panels in all the blue boxes ... contain sensitive information . It could jeopardize the operations if they fall into the wrong hands . Lyle obviously knew that he could get a price for one of these panels . Set himself up , make a move back into the Centre . That 's why this time he has to be dealt with with finality . The situation has to be cleaned , but has to be played close to the vest . You want me to set it up ? Daddy ... I 'm not an assassin . I 'm sure you 'll do the right thing . It 's taken a lot of maneuvering to rebuild my position here ... and Lyle 's appearance makes me look inefficient . - Daddy - - Angel ... it 's about us protecting each other . You don 't protect me ... I can 't protect you . [ Sighs ] I 'm goin ' home and finish my present . [ Sniffs ] I 'll see you in the morning . Later . - Hey , Nicky , gimme a ride home , will ya ? - Can I get you something else ? I 'll have a vodka rocks if you 'll join me . Twist my arm . - Let me get it . - No , no , not that . Joey waters it down . - I keep the good stuff back in the freezer . - Whoa , whoa , wait a minute . Uh , no , thank you . I will pass . I don 't wanna drink anything that comes from a place where , you know , a cop died . What are you talking about ? Joey told me how they whacked that RICO cop in the deep-freeze . Oh , my God . You didn 't know . That was the nightJoey had me shut the place down early . l-I just thought - I had no idea they killed someone . What about Dean Clark ? You know that undercover cop ... that was charged with the murder of Les Knight ? Was he here that night ? He was in the bar . He was drinking gin with Bobby . Hell , he was so hammered , they had to carry him out of here . You okay ? I 'm just pulling my head out of the sand . One cop is dead . An innocent one is going to be executed for it . Hell , how did I get here ? And how do I get out ? Central Records , please . Mmm . Yes , this is Officer 557 E. I 'd like to get a copy of all requests made in the last two days ... for a rap sheet on oneJarod Puzo . Yes , I 'll hold . Hmm . Who ? Thank you . That 's all the information I need . You can 't take it all . I need change for the customers . Keep talking , Faye . Your head will wind up on the wall next to your Hawaiian shot . Geez , I don 't believe this . - What 'd you say ? - Hey , Joey , Joey ! The customers . You want the money to keep coming in this place , now don 't ya ? Where 's Bobby ? He ain 't coming in today . He 's married to the toilet . Something he drank . Lush . And I 'm supposed to be across town . - I could make the delivery for ya . - [ Scoffs ] You don 't wanna be late with the gift . All right . Just make sure you 're there by 10 : 00 . Not a problem . I don 't wanna get a phone call . Evening , Mr. Flanagan . Where 's Bobby ? Plumbing problems . You 're the wiseass from the interview room . First impressions can be so misguided . You tellJoey if he wants our arrangement to continue ... I 'm gonna need more money . There are people who have to be paid . - I understand . - Good . Just make sure you do . No doubt about it . And make sure that Broots stays focused on finding Jarod . You know how he is . Living proof of what happens when A.D.D. goes undiagnosed . What did he ask you to do ? I tell Broots what to do . - Your father . - It doesn 't matter . I don 't believe you , Parker . Lyle shows up , and suddenly you 're a Cleaner again for onejob . What did your father ask you to do ? - He wants me to handle the situation . - To kill him ? Lyle has coming whatever he has coming . You sound like you actually believe it . - I do . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - [ Ring ] - What ? Oh . What 's the name of it ? Lyle 's been located at a hotel in Providence . What are you going to do about it , Parker ? - I 'm going to handle the situation . - And then ? And then I 'm gonna go home and sleep like a baby . [ Tapping ] Check . Mate . I warned you . [ Laughs ] - That seat 's taken . - Eugene Clark . - Maybe . - I 'm a friend of Dean 's . You 're a wiseguy . And you got some nerve coming here like this . I think it 's against the law to hit a federal agent . Federal agent ? You work with Dean ? No . But I know he respects you ... and would never do anything to hurt you . Look . I 'm not a father . But I am a son , and I know the feelings that a son has ... wanting to grow up like his father ... wanting to make him proud . I used to think that was Dean . For the last three months , I 've been racking my brain wondering where I went wrong . You did the best you could . - I gotta go . - Mr. Clark . Dean is a good cop . Don 't give up on him . [ Miss Parker ] Lyle 's been located at a hotel in Providence . [ Sydney ] What are you going to do about it , Parker ? What are you going to do about it ? [ Mr. Parker ] This time he has to be dealt with with finality . [ Sydney ] What are you going to do about it ? [ Miss Parker ] I 'm not an assassin . [ Mr. Parker ] This time he has to be dealt with with finality . With finality . Finality . With finality . Finality . [ Sydney ] What are you going to do about it ? - I 'm not an assassin . - [ Mr. Parker ] I 'm sure you 'll do the right thing . I 'm sure you 'll do the right thing . [ Phone Ringing ] - Yes ? - [ Mr. Lyle ] So close and yet so far . That 's become somewhat of an anthem for you , hasn 't it ? - Mr. Lyle . - Don 't be disappointed , Miss Parker . If you can 't catch Jarod , what chance do you think you have with me ? You sound like you 're catching a cold . It must be dark and wet where you are . - A temporary condition . - We want the computer chip . I can 't do that . Not if I want to keep the rest of my appendages . If you 'll excuse me , I 've got a rendezvous with a very anxious buyer . $ 20 million , Miss Parker . God bless the American dream . [ Click , Dial Tone ] You left something behind . [ Dial Tone ] [ Beeping ] [ Line Ringing ] [ Man ] You have reached Hillman Marine . At the present , no one is available to take your call . Our normal business hours are from - [ Ringing ] - [ Beeps ] - Broots . [ Speakerphone : Miss Parker ] You ever heard of a place called Hillman ? Oh , yeah , it 's in Connecticut . It 's where the Centre 's data backup warehouse is located . - The what ? - Uh , every Friday night at 11 : 59 p. m ... all the Centre mainframes from across the country do this mass computer backup ... into this giant system from their blue boxes . Blue boxes . [ Whispering ] Do you think Lyle 's trying to infiltrate the warehouse ? Can you think of a reason why he would ? - It 's how he could decrypt it . - What are you talking about ? The semiconductor panel he stole is encrypted . The code 's impossible to break , but if he were able ... to input this panel into the warehouse mainframe ... at 11 : 59 p. m ... on F - Tonight ! Tonight , when the backup occurs ... it will automatically decrypt whatever information is on it . Which is how he gets 20 million for it . 20 million ? Man , crime does pay . All right , listen . Is it located by a river , a lake , the ocean , something like that ? - A river , yeah . - He rented a boat . He does his business . He runs out to the pier . - He escapes in a boat . - Unless - Unless I make sure he doesn 't . Plates came in . They 're being delivered this afternoon . Excellent . Have them sent here . - Here ? - Yeah . What , nobody 's gonna be surprised when we shut this dump down . We 'll print the money here , and we 'll torch the place . What about Faye ? We can 't leave any witnesses , can we ? [ Foghorn Sounds In Distance ] Midnight stroll ? - How 'd you find me ? - I hit " redial . " [ Laughs ] It is always the simplest thing , isn 't it ? The chip . You know , $ 20 million ... - split two ways is - - [ Safety Clicks ] apparently out of the question . Why follow Jarod if this is what you wanted ? That was to pay off a debt . Jarod is to win friends and influence people . I bring him in , all 's forgiven . The Centre welcome mat 's been yanked for you , cowboy . We 'll see . So they sent you to clean up . - You really gonna kill me ? - That 's up to you . Then why are you still talking about it ? [ Sniffs ] Not as easy as it looks , is it ? You know why you don 't wanna kill me ? Because you are me . It 's a natural desire for people like us to dominate and define . You and I have nothing in common . We - We both recognize ... that this notion of human equality ... just perpetuates mediocrity . But we 're not mediocre . Are we , Miss Parker ? We 're independent . And independence , it 's a privilege of the strong . Tell me , Miss Parker . How strong are you ? Strong enough . - How strong are you ? - Test me . Nice working with you . [ Gunshot ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing ] - Yeah . - [ Faye ] Mr. Flanagan ? - I own a restaurant called Jax . - How did you get this number ? Some friends of yours are over there now , setting you up to take a big fall . I hope you remember this call if I need help in the future . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Yeah . [ Faye ] There were some cops hanging around the bar . - Cops ? - I overheard one say ... Flanagan was gonna set you up for a big fall tonight . I thought you should know . [ Phone Beeps ] [ Mumbles ] - [ Mumbles ] - What the hell is this ? [ Yells ] [ Pool Balls Clatter ] [ Exhales ] [ Clicks ] Turn around slowly and put your piece on the pool table . So , what the hell is Martinizing ? And why do you gotta pay extra for it anyway ? - What is this ? - I just thought you 'd like to see ... how Les Knight looked after you had Joey kill him . - Who are you ? - Turn around and walk . - Get in there . - Hey ! Hey ! You 're a dead man , Jarod ! You hear me ? You 're dead ! Oh , you need to chill out . Ow ! Looks a little cramped in there . Imagine how Dean Clark must feel in his cell . You 're RICO . Did you know about this ? - What do you think ? - Well , the truth is ... I 'm not really a cop or a mobster . It 's sort of complicated . Now , each of you is responsible for the murder of Les Knight . So I thought it would be really neat ... if you felt like he felt . [ Beeping ] Listen , Jarod . It wasn 't my idea to bump off that - Shut up , Joey . Shut up ! Les Knight found out about Flanagan , and Flanagan bumped him off . [ Flanagan ] Yeah , and you dumped the body , and then you framed Dean Clark . Listen , Jarod . I 'll give you anything you want . Actually , you 've just given me everything I need . Jarod , please , you just - you can 't leave me in here to die . It doesn 't really matter if you freeze ... or you suffocate . Like you say , Joey ... " Dead is dead . " - Hey , let us out ! - Jarod , no ! - You 're dead ! - Open this door ! Jarod , don 't do it ! [ Indistinct Yelling ] I don 't wanna suffocate in here . No , Jarod , please . ! Please , no , no . ! It 's a mess , Miss Parker . No head , one of his arms ... both his legs are missing . I 'm guessing he got chewed up by a prop of a rather large boat . But it 's him . Thumbs give it away . [ Sydney ] Mr. Lyle . He pulled a gun on you . He made the choice for you . - I 'll see you later . - Miss Parker . - Will you be all right ? - I 'm just tired , Syd . I 'm gonna go home to bed , and I have a feeling I am gonna sleep like a baby . [ Ship 's Horn Blows ] I , uh - [ Clears Throat ] I downloaded what was on that semiconductor chip ... before Raines had it confiscated . It contained codes . It 's a computer chip , Broots . No , no , no . I don 't think you understand . It contained genetic codes . Genetic codes ? - Yeah . - For what ? I think the appropriate question would be " For whom ? " - And ? - I 'm not a geneticist . I just can 't help but wonder if it 's - Has something to do with Jarod . Ah . How 's my angel ? There were genetic codes on that stolen panel . Oh , don 't worry about that . That 's not important . Important enough to have me kill a man . Why , he 's the enemy . You did the right thing . For who ? [ Sniffs ] Ah , smell that clean air , boy . You can 't have too much of that in this life . Get some rest , angel . You look like hell . It 's a joke . [ Laughs ] [ Jarod ] After you testify in court ... and all this blows over ... send me a postcard from Hawaii . [ Chuckles ] Hawaii ? I don 't even have enough money to get toJersey . You do now . Where did this come from ? Joey 's private account . All the money he took from you . Plus interest . Oh . Who are you really ? [ Sighs ] An artist .

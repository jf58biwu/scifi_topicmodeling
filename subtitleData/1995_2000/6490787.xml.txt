 " Yeah , we 've given your grievances a lot of consideration . " Yeah , a lot . " No , don 't think you 're not expendable . No . " He never once said I was doing a good job . All my hard work . Nobody ever stuck up for me . Th-They were all treated special . All right , nobody moves ! Everybody stays ! Shut up ! I said shut up ! Now listen to me ! Everyone , listen to me ! Okay , the children can go . Everybody else- - nobody moves . - We need the police , quick . - You hear me ? ! I said nobody else moves ! Come on , come on , hurry up . Please don 't harm anyone . Get away . I 'll shoot . You 're frightening these people . I 'll do it . Hey ! I will do it . They 've done nothing to you . Oh , you don 't know . Give me the gun . I am not a loser . No , you 're not . They made me do it . They made me . But you 're not going to do it . You 're going to show them . You 're going to show them . No ! Stay down ! Oh ... God . I 'm going to die . Nobody 's going to die . All right , folks , clear . Move back , move back now . Come on . Back , back , please . - Where are the wounded ? - What ? I 'm FBI . Where are the people who were shot ? Everybody 's inside . But you aren 't going to find any wounded . You the first medic on the scene ? - Yes , sir . - Can you tell me what happened ? Well , it doesn 't make any sense . We got a call there 'd been a shooting- - at least one man was down- - but when we got here , there wasn 't a damn thing to do . Excuse me . I 'm Special Agent Scully , FBI . I want to talk to somebody who can tell me what happened . Well , I can tell you what I saw , but I don 't think there 's a man here who can tell you what happened . What did you see ? Maybe you should talk to this man . He was one of the ones shot . You were shot ? Right here . Right in the stomach . I felt the bullet enter me , and the next thing I remember was being on the floor . My legs and arms were numb , and I could taste blood in my throat . Then I see the man 's face . What man ? It was the same guy who tried to talk the gun guy out of hurting anyone . What did he do ? He touched me , and he said I was going to be okay , and then , all of a sudden , I could feel my legs and arms again . Who are you ? My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm an FBI agent . I understand you 've been read your rights . Will you talk to me , Mr. Muntz ? Can you tell me what happened ? God ... spared my life today . He took pity on my soul , and he washed away my sins . How do you mean ? He reached down and healed me with his hand ... with the palm of his hand . Who did ? A man . A holy man . All I can think is it must have been the good Lord himself . Did you talk to him ? Who ? The shooter described a man , a man who reached down and healed him with the palm of his hand . He 's gone . They let him leave the scene ? Well , nobody let him leave . He was in custody , and they were talking to him , and then somehow he just disappeared . Just vanished ? Without a trace . It struck me as I was sitting here . What ? Everything changes but the sea . What do you want from me ? I thought we might at least allow ourselves to reminisce . I have nothing to say to you . Really ? We used to have so much to say to each other . So many good times at the Mulders ' summer place . Your kids ... young and energetic . I remember water-skiing down there with Bill . He was a good water-skier , your husband . Not as good as I was , but then that could be said about so many things couldn 't it ? I 've repressed it all . Well ... I find that hard to believe . Particularly since I 've come here today to ask you to remember something . Something I 'm going to have to ask you to try very hard to recollect . Yeah , he gave his name as Jeremiah Smith of Suitland , Virginia . He gave a P.O. box that 's turned out to be phony . He had no driver 's license . All the cars in the parking lot have been accounted for ? Yeah . Which means he must have walked from somewhere nearby . We 've got a canvass out . - And you talked to him personally ? - Yeah . Damnedest thing , and I swear this is how it happened . I look down in my notebook to write something . I look up- - the guy 's not standing there anymore . It was like he just disappeared . Thank you . Mulder . Agent Mulder , this is Assistant Director Skinner 's office . Would you please hold for him ? Yeah . Agent Mulder . Uh-huh . I just received a call here that might cause you some alarm . What is it ? Your mother 's just been admitted to a hospital in serious condition . A small coastal town in Rhode Island called , uh , Quono ... Quonochontaug ? I 'm on my way . The nurse said she had a stroke . They don 't yet know the nature or severity of it , but the doctor 's on his way down . She 's cold . Mulder , I don 't want to jump to conclusions . I don 't want you to think the worst . People recover from these situations all of the time . Mom . She hasn 't been able to speak . She 's been in and out of consciousness . How did she get here ? A 911 call came in . The paramedics from Shelter Harbor found her on the floor of the house . Mom . Hi . It 's okay . Everything 's going to be okay . What is it ? What do you want ? I think she wants something to write on . " Palm " ? She 's had what 's called a subarachnoid hemorrhage , but they 're very hopeful because the circulation was restored so quickly . She 's going to be under constant supervision and the best care in the hospital up in Providence . It could be a lot worse . Thanks . You okay ? Yeah . I 'm , um ... I just can 't help thinking there 's a correlation . Correlation ? A connection to the shootings at the fast food restaurant . I 'm sorry , I-I don 't understand . My mother wrote the word " palm . " That 's what the man who healed the victims , that 's what he used- - the palm of his hand . You-you think it 's a leap ? Mulder , there 's no deep mystery here . Your mother is at the right age for something like this to happen . Yeah , but why the word " palm " ? Well , there could be several reasons , but to be honest , I don 't think it means anything . Her-her brain and her thought processes have been ... have been radically changed by what 's happened . It could very well have affected her center of speech , her language . But you can 't explain it exactly , nor can it be explained how the wounded were miraculously healed , or how the man who healed them just vanished into thin air , can it ? I 'm sure it can ... and will be . Mulder , I 'm going to drive you to the nearest motel . It 's been a very long day . I want to go back to D.C. To do what ? I want to find out who this miracle man is . This is everything shot by the first news crew on the scene- - outtakes and unedited footage . Did they get any tape with the man in question ? Yeah . It 's supposed to be at about 8 : 22 . There . That must be him . Whoa . What happened there ? Yeah . He 's gone . Where did he go ? You see that ? Yeah . It 's like he 's gone , but there 's ... somebody else in his place . Wearing the same clothes . Could that be another detective ? Why don 't you find out . Where are you going ? If I told you , you 'd never let me go . Mulder , you haven 't slept in almost 24 hours . Call me if you find anything . He was here with her . What ? With your mother . The Cancer Man . What are you talking about ? Maybe I can bring you up to speed , Agent Mulder . Did you take these ? They had quite an argument , as you might gather from the snapshots . You seem surprised . Surely you were aware they knew each other ... or what brought them here together . I don 't know . Did he hurt her ? No . No , she collapsed after he left . I dare say if I hadn 't been here to make the call , she might not have survived . What did they argue about ? I don 't know . I was forced to keep a discreet distance . You must have had some idea , or else you wouldn 't have followed them here . He wants something from her . Something she may have kept in this house . Unless you know another reason they would have chosen to meet here . On the day my parents divorced , my mother vowed never to set foot in the summer house again . I know my mother . She kept her word . It could be something very old . Certainly something very important . I have no idea what that could be . No idea at all ? No . Sir ? Excuse me . I ... - Yes ? - Are you Jeremiah Smith ? Yes . I 'm afraid there 's been some mistake . I saw my photo on the news saying I fled a crime scene . I 'm here to turn myself in . Well , uh ... would you come with me , sir ? Mm-hmm . From the moment I stepped from the crowd and asked the man to put down his gun , it seemed like ... a dream . As if I was out of my body . There were reports- - somewhat fantastic reports- - about what happened next . I know . I saw the news reports . I 'll have to say that I don 't remember any of it . - Nothing . - You gave me a wrong address , sir , then you left the crime scene during the interview . I don 't remember that . I 'm sorry . What do you remember , Mr. Smith ? I remember showing up for work the next day , being at my desk . That 's ... my first recollection . At the Social Security Administration ? I 'm not sure what I 've done wrong . You haven 't done anything wrong , sir . May I go ? Yes . But until this matter is resolved completely , I 'd ask that you notify us if you 'll be out of town for any reason . Agent Scully ? This becomes a responsibility- - the thing I 'm now called upon to put right and put down . Certainly you expected nothing less . I 'm not ashamed of my actions . Ashamed ? You 're not allowed the luxury of human weakness in penitence . You 're not allowed to put your indulgences ahead of the greater purpose . I no longer believe in the greater purpose . Then your fate is just . My justice is not for you to mete out . You may have reason ; you have no right . You have no means either . You presume to dictate duty to me ? Have you any idea what the cost of your actions is ? What their effect might be ? Who are you to give them hope ? What do you give them ? We give them happiness , and they give us authority . The authority to take away their freedom under the guise of democracy . Men can never be free , because they are weak , corrupt , worthless and restless . The people believe in authority . They 've grown tired of waiting for miracle and mystery . Science is their religion . No greater explanation exists for them . They must never believe any differently if the project is to go forward . At what cost to them ? The question 's irrelevant and the outcome inevitable . The date is set . At what cost to them for your own selfish benefit ? How many must die at your hand to preserve your stake in the project ? I 'm not impressed by your miracles or moved by your trickery . Your justice will be meted out . By whom this time , and by what tool ? By those who possess the tool of your destruction . Hold his calls . I want his name . I want to know everything about him . Excuse me ? I want the Smoking Man smoked out ; I want him exposed to be the murdering son of a bitch that he is . What 's your problem , Mulder ? - Where have you been ? - At our summer house . He was there with my mother . He 's the reason - for what happened to her . - Where 'd you get these ? It doesn 't matter where I got those . The only thing that matters is that that man is called to answer . - Now , I want his name ! - I don 't know his name ! - You know how to get it ! - These men don 't have names ! Well , then you tell me how to find him ! Agent Mulder , there was a time when I might have been able to tell you how to contact him , but that time has passed . He knows about the man that disappeared from the restaurant shooting . What are you talking about ? He 's trying to kill him . Mulder , he just came in yesterday . He turned himself in . What ? He-he gave a statement . Where is he now ? He works for the Social Security Administration . We 're looking for Jeremiah Smith . Mr. Smith ? Hello . I 'm with the FBI . I 'd like you to come with me . For what ? I told you everything I know . I thought they said you 'd call if there was anything . I 'm sure you don 't want to cause a scene at work , sir . No , of course not . I 'll come along . Where are you taking me ? Can you tell me where you 're taking me ? We 'll have plenty of time to talk , sir . Hey ! Watch it ! You see him ? No , I lost him . It 's only a matter of time now . You put me in a cage ... within a cage . Why are you so afraid of me ? I 'm not . Yes , you are . You live in fear . That 's your whole life . You don 't know anything about me . I know everything about you . You think the miracles I perform ... are the extent of my power ? You think you 're God . You 're a drone ... a cataloger ... chattel . What you 're afraid of is ... they 'll believe I am God . Well , it doesn 't matter . Most of them have ceased to believe in God . Why ? Because God presents them with no miracles to earn their faith . You think when man ceases to believe in miracles , he rejects God ? Of course . You rule over them in God 's name . They don 't believe in him , but they still fear him . They 're afraid not to because they 're afraid of freedom . And you give them happiness . We appease their conscience . Anyone who can appease a man 's conscience can take his freedom away from him . And if you can 't appease their conscience , you kill them . But you can 't kill them all . You can 't kill their love , which is what makes them who they are , makes them better than us- - better than you . You talk . I 'm not one of you . No . All you want is to be a part of it- - is to be one of the commandants when the process begins . But you are wrong . Oh . Am I ? Yes . You are dying of lung cancer . It 's a lie . You think it 's a lie ? You want to save your life . And you ? We have been hopeful , but there was substantial blood loss during the stroke event , which has put a lot of pressure on the brain . Will she regain consciousness ? I know this is hard , but she may not . I can be paged if you need me . Thank you . You going to smoke that , or you want to smoke on this ? Are you giving me a choice ? I should shoot you right here , but they 'd probably be able to save you . Do it . Do it , Agent Mulder . Or maybe put a bullet through your brain so you 'll be bedridden for the rest of your life like my mother . How is she ? What do you care ? I 've known your mother since before you were born , Fox . I don 't care . I 'd gone to see her recently . Yeah . And I know what you were looking for . I wasn 't looking for anything . It 's what she was looking for , actually . She contacted me . You 're a liar ! I had information , possibly ... on the whereabouts of your sister . Where is she ? Where is she ? It seems the man who had the information has disappeared . I have what you want . There 's nothing I want , Agent Mulder , except to see how your mother 's doing . How is Mrs. Mulder ? Do you have it ? - Do you have it ? - Yes . Give it to me . I can 't do that . It 's of no value to you . And to you ? When the time comes . When the truth is finally determined , its value will soar . Why ? I think you know why , Agent Mulder . It 's a weapon , isn 't it ? Used to pierce the back of the neck . It 's the only way we can kill them . A simple gunshot won 't do . Why do you want it ? They will kill you for it , Agent Mulder . That 's a fact . They 'll stop at nothing for it , nothing- - even if they have to martyr you and risk turning your work into a crusade . Let me get clear on something here . What we 're talking about is colonization . The date is set , isn 't it ? Give me the weapon , Agent Mulder . No . You shoot me , and you 'll never find it . I ought to shoot you anyway , after everything I 've given you . I 'm walking away . You 're a dead man , Agent Mulder one way or the other . Who is it ? Jeremiah Smith . Please , let me in . I want you to put your hands up where I can see them . Okay , I want you to keep your hands up . I 'm going to unlock the door . I want you to count to five , come in , close the door and lock it behind you . Keep your hands up , please . I have important information for you- - something your partner has been seeking . It concerns an elaborate plan- - a project- - and his sister . Why didn 't you tell me before ? I 've never spoken to you before . The man you spoke to was an imposter . He was sent here to kill me . Who are you ? I 'll explain everything . Yeah . Scully , it 's me . Mulder , where are you ? I 've been up with my mother . Listen to me . Mulder , listen to me . There 's somebody here- - somebody you need to talk to . Who ? Jeremiah Smith . All right , Scully , you got to get out of your apartment . They 're going to be looking for him . I want you to meet me . Where ? Off the I-95 . Uh , Bond Mill Road . Scully ! Scully , move away from him . Come stand behind me . I 've come to you at great risk . I mean you no harm . I have a long and complicated story to tell you . Mulder , he knows about your sister . How do I know you 're for real ? I was at that restaurant ; I healed those people . Yes , but how ? I can explain everything to you . First , I want you to come somewhere with me . I want you to come with me to see my mother . He 's here to kill me . I made this !

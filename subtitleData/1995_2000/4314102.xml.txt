 We 're almost there . How you doin ' , hon ? Breathe deeply . Just like that . There you go . You 're doin ' great . Yeah , real great . Ma 'am ? Ma 'am ? Ma 'am , i 'll need your full name and social security number . Amanda nelligan . 545020809 . Your insurance carrier ? Great . Atlantic mutual . Is there anyone you need us to contact ? The father of the baby ? I 'm not sure how to get ahold of him . - Give me his name . I can try . - He 's not from around here . - Is he from out of state ? - Another planet . All right , we 're here now . Hold on . One more little push , amanda . There you go . You 're gonna set a speed record . Great . There 's a cute face . Doll syringe . This is like the indy 500 . Here comes the shoulder . Good . Okay , amanda . That 'll do it ! Oh . Oh , god . - What ? What is it ? - It 's okay . She 's just fine . Perfectly healthy . No problem . Everything 's gonna be a-ok . You 've got a healthy baby girl . Oh , a little girl ! Good lord , not another one ! I admit the photo 's a little over the top , but , um , what do you think , scully ? Not seriously . Children born with vestigial tails don 't interest you ? Codal appendages . Fetuses have them . Their coccyx enlarges to contain the spinal fluid , and then it shrinks as the child develops . Occasionally , it doesn 't . It 's extremely rare but it has been known to happen . Five times within the last three months ? All in a town with a population of less than 15,000 people ? I 'd say that 's a little more than a statistical anomaly . So would i . No , mulder , I ... i think you 're right . I think that something about this definitely warrants investigation . Only not by us . I 'd say that it is a job for the local health department . I called around . They 're already investigating . So what else about this interests you ? Could it be , uh , visitors from space ? The doctor said that ... my baby 's gonna be fine . She 's really healthy . And when she gets to be a few months old , it 's just a matter of " snip . " - That 's good to hear . - Yeah . Did you experience any unusual complications during your pregnancy ? Did you undergo any kind of fertility treatment ? No . I wasn 't trying to get pregnant . I guess you could just sort of say i 'm a single mom now . When you were admitted , you said that the , uh , the baby 's father was from another planet . What did you mean by that exactly ? You know , that ... he 's not from this planet . Were you abducted ? Huh ? no . No . He dropped by my apartment one day , and one thing sort of led to another . But the baby 's father is an alien . No ! No , i didn 't say he was an alien . I said he was from another planet . His name is luke skywalker . He 's what 's known as a jedi knight . - Did he have a light saber ? - No , he didn 't bring it . He did sing a song for me , though . How many times have you seen star wars , amanda ? Three hundred sixty-eight . I should break 400 by memorial day . Okay . Thank you . Wait a minute , wait . You know these four other babies that were born here with tails ? - Uh-huh . - There couldn 't be any chance ... luke 's the father , is there ? Okay , all right . I 've got it , thank you . Take your best shot , scully . I think there 's more going on here than luke skywalker and his light saber . I think you 're right . Are you coming ? Here are the p.c.r. S that we ran for the five children . We put calls into the parents . We 'll blood test all the husbands , hopefully by this afternoon just to double-check . Good . They 'll be none too happy . I have to confess ... this answer seems so strangely obvious , i probably wouldn 't have even checked for it . What answer ? You see here , these identical band trait matches , all showing a small loss of a part of chromosome number eight ? Each of these five children , born to five different women , all share the same father . - Yeah ? - I should have thought of it sooner . This kind of appended birth defect is often passed on within a family . Meaning the father had a tail as well ? Though he most likely had it surgically removed somewhere along the way . How would this happen ? Birds and the bees and the monkey babies , mulder . Birds do it , bees do it , even educated m.d. S do it . All five of these women shared the same ob-gyn , didn 't they ? Well , yeah . He 's the only one in town . And four of the five women , the four married women , not including amanda nelligan , are on record as receiving insemination therapy as a means of conception . So you 're thinking that the doctor might have something to do with it ? So much for not putting all your eggs in one basket . we should find the best lawyer we can . Because i definitely plan to sue . That 's all i 'm saying , fred . babboo , let me do the talking . I 'll handle this . Just tell him we 're gonna sue . Ah , you too , huh ? What the hell did you do ? Yeah , alton . What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . We 're gonna figure this out . I promise . Look , everybody , just relax . - Don 't you tell me to relax ! What happened to my sperm ? - yeah , mine too ! - Whose did you use ? - It 's bad enough having a boy with a tail . Then you find out it 's not even yours ! For god 's sake , alton , how many of us are there ? I 'm special agent mulder with the federal bureau of investigation . - This is agent scully . - Great ! Arrest this son of a bitch . No , sir , settle down . Nobody 's going to be arrested . - We 're just here to find out what 's goin ' on . - Alton didn 't use my sperm . I most certainly did . Each of you women ... was inseminated with your husband 's own sperm and nobody else 's . Why was it necessary to inseminate in these cases ? It was a sperm motility issue . The intrauterine process that i used ... has about a 40 percent chance of success . I was surprised . It seemed to work all four times . The only thing i can think of is ... what ? Maybe it never worked at all . What are you saying ? I want to know what he means by that . I haven 't been with a man since 1989. i mean , not counting you , honey . I 'm not accusing anyone of anything . I 'm just saying , this latest patient of mine who gave birth to a baby with a tail ? She didn 't even undergo insemination . So you are blaming the wrong baby doctor . Hey . Excuse me . I 'm an agent with the federal bureau of investigation . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . Uh , yeah , okay . Scully , check it out . Oh , my god . That 's him ? He 's the one ? Five out of five . They spelled my name wrong . It 's van blundht , with a silent " h . " B-l-u-n-d-h-t . We 'll get right on that . Lots of people spell it wrong . It 's like dutch or somethin ' . Can i go now ? No . There 's a few things we have to clear up first . Yeah . Like how 'd you do it ? What do you mean , " how 'd i do it " ? You 're the father of five children , mr . Van blundht . Is that not news to you ? Do you have any insight into how five women came to be inseminated with your sperm ? You make it sound so romantic . So you 're , you 're saying there was romance involved ? Why is that so hard to believe ? Just ' cause i was born with a tail , no woman would want me ? Maybe i got personality . You ever think of that ? You had sex with these women ? How is it that none of them have any recollection , whatsoever , of that happening ? Look , i 'm not saying anything one way or another . I 'm just sayin ' , hypothetically , if some woman wanted to have kids and their husbands weren 't capable , and everybody was happy , and nobody got hurt , hypothetically , where 's the crime ? If you 're waitin ' for my usual theory as to what 's goin ' on , i don 't have one . I do . On behalf of all the women in the world , i seriously doubt this has anything to do with consensual sex . I think it involved some form of rohypnol-rape . The tranquilizer ? I didn 't think of that . Called the " date rape drug . " High doses of it cause a loosening of inhibitions , memory loss . Now if van blundht was somehow able to slip the drug to these women , especially in conjunction with alcohol ... yeah , but when and where would he have had the opportunity to slip it to them ? He identified these women through his janitorial job at the medical park . He could 've followed them anywhere , to a club , to a bar . Those women don 't look like the type that do a lot of solo drinking . I think it 's enough to keep him in custody while we check it out . Ah , you spelled my name wrong . It 's b-l-u-n-d-h-t . Silent " h . " Address ? I strongly suggest you stop eyeballin ' me and tell me your address . 17 prospect parkway . Martinsburg , 25401 . All right , mr . Blund-ht . Give me your phone number . What the hell ? The " h " is silent . I could 've sworn curtis clocked out hours ago . He said good night to me and everything . This morning i find him shoved underneath the desk . Deputy , are you sure you don 't remember what happened last night ? The guy cold-cocked me . Except , he wasn 't the guy . He was me . My head hurts . I found van blundht 's clothes in the locker room . He must 've walked out of here wearing the deputy 's spare uniform . After hitting him over the head . I have a theory . Do you want to hear it ? Van blundht somehow physically transformed into his captor , then walked out the door leaving no one the wiser ? Should we be pickin ' out china patterns or what ? Why can 't you just go for the simple answer ? With that blow to the head , the deputy might have identified ... mcgruff the crime dog as his attacker . What about what the sheriff saw ? Two men , roughly the same build , the same coloring , the addition of the uniform goes a long way to explain how someone ... can mistake one man for another at 3 : 00 in the morning . Conversely , my theory goes a long way to explaining ... how four married women could mistake van blundht for their husbands , and how amanda nelligan could think he was luke skywalker . We 've both seen something like this before , scully . But what are you saying ? That , that van blundht is an alien ? Not unless they have trailer parks in space . No , this is something different . Scully , if you could be somebody else for a day , who would it be ? Hopefully myself . So boring . Wouldn 't you even be tempted to try on somebody else 's existence for a day ? Live your life as somebody else ? Looking like someone else , and being someone else are completely different things . Maybe it 's not . Everybody else around you would treat you like you were somebody else . Ultimately maybe it 's other people 's reactions to us that make us who we are . All right then , eleanor roosevelt . You can 't be a dead person . Why the hell not ? Because . What are you doin sneakin ' around my porch ? We 're with the f.b.i. Is this the home of edward van blundht ? Yeah , that 's me . We 're looking for your son , eddie , junior . Eddie ? What did that moron do now ? Five women ? Oh , lord ! Anything else ? Yes , he attacked a sheriff 's deputy ... during his escape from custody . Hurt bad ? Fortunately not . Well , thank heavens for that at least . Sir , do you have any idea where your son might be ? I wish i did . I 'm sorry . I haven 't seen him for the last two days . Is this ... is this you ? One and the same . Hey , you wanna see ? No ! No . No , thank you . My son had his removed when he was , uh , just a kid . Kept buggin ' me and buggin ' me ... until i finally let him do it . There you go . I told him it was a mistake . I said , " son , you ain 't much to look at . " You ain 't no athlete ... " and you sure the hell ain 't no einstein . " But at least you got that tail . Otherwise , you 're just small potatoes . " But he didn 't listen . Sir , does your son have any other unique medical conditions ? I mean , aside from the tail ? Mr. Mulder , that boy was born sickly . We used to have this condition down in the south called pellagra . Excuse me , sir , how did you know my name was mulder ? She told me it was . Mmm , no , actually i didn 't . It 's him ! Pretty spry for an old guy , huh ? Eddie , junior . Not senior ? Whichever one he is , wouldn 't you say he 's a man with a secret ? Honey , what are you doing home so early ? That was daddy . Something 's wrong with daddy . Fred ? Honey ? Fred , is everything okay ? Everything 's fine . What happened to the clothes you were wearing this morning ? L-i 'll explain later . Just give me a little privacy , okay , uh ... babboo ? Okay , sugar patootie . I 'll check upstairs . I 'm all right . What ? Oh ! It 's quicklime . Move back over there . Back . Not so spry . Think the fall killed him ? Babboo , i 'm home . Oh , crap ! I 'm home early . What ? You were just here . You went into the bathroom . What ? Honey , what do you mean i went into the bathroom ? Shh , come here . Someone is in the bathroom . It 's all clear . So , what killed eddie the monkey man ? It 's difficult to say . The quicklime burned the tissue even as it preserved it . So , what killed him is one of two things i haven 't figured out yet . What 's the other thing ? That would be this . Striated muscle tissue . - What 's unusual about that ? - In and of itself , nothing . Where i found it , however ... where did you find it ? Everywhere . His entire body . As far as i can tell , this man has a thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue ... underpinning the entire dermal layer of his skin . That 's not normal . This man 's body is quite a scientific specimen . And thankfully , it 's preserved and intact . In other words , there are 654 muscles in the human body , and this man , essentially , has 655 . Um , could that somehow be related to his , uh , having a tail ? Possibly . It could be , uh , a lynx gene birth defect . What would be the , uh , purpose of this muscle ? You got me , mulder . You know , maybe none . It appears to be atrophied . Although it may look that way as a result of the mummification . Could this be , uh , a " like father , like son " kind of thing ? - What do you mean ? - Could eddie , junior have , the same anomalous muscular structure as his dad here ? Maybe . What are you suggesting ? If this musculature underlies the entire skin , then maybe it could be utilized to remold the skin 's shape and texture , which would go a long way to explaining why we 're looking for a man ... who can appear to be his own father , or anyone else for that matter . Isn 't it much more likely that this man simply has an identical twin ? - Check that out . - Where are you going ? Something about van blundht 's m.o. Confuses me . His victims were four married women who wanted to get pregnant . - And one single woman who didn 't . - Mm-hmm . Come in . Sorry , ms . Nelligan . I 'm sorry to bother you . No , it 's no bother . I just have a few additional questions i wanted to ask you . Okay . Here we go , sweetie . Bye , bye . We 'll just come back later . You know , i thought they were lettin' me stay in the hospital so long ... because i had really , really great insurance . Turns out they 're just keepin ' me here because they think i 'm sort of crazy . They wanna make sure i 'm safe to be around my baby . Free cable . I want to ask you , do you recognize this man ? Oh , yes . Eew ! That 's eddie van blundht . What can you tell me about him ? We went out all through high school . Okay , brother . What ? Nothing . He 's just ... he 's sort of a loser . He 's one of those guys you look back on and you go , " oh , my god , what was i thinking ? What was i thinking ? " Ah , well , what specifically made him a loser ? I don 't know . Everything . He had like one million annoying personal habits . You know , just no sense of romance , no ambition , you know , no direction . I hear he 's like a janitor or somethin ' now . He had this weird family . His dad was in a circus or somethin ' . I don 't know . He never let me meet him , thank god . Well , he must have had some good qualities . Yeah , sure . Everybody 's got a few . We had some good times . He really lovedstar wars so we used to go and see it every weekend . That was nice . Hmm . He was no luke , that 's for sure . Why do you want to know about eddie ? That 's official f.b.i. Business . Wow . Here you go . I wanted to congratulate you on this blessed event . Thank you ! May the force be with you . Hello , there . I 'm here to see amanda nelligan . Just down the hall there . Come in . No , seriously though , why do you want to know about eddie ? - What about eddie ? - Why were you asking me all those questions about him ? Mulder . Agent mulder , this is fred niemann . Is it okay for us to get into our bathroom now ? Excuse me , sir ? I was hoping we could get into our bathroom sometime this evening . You said the police were gonna come by and dust it for fingerprints , but that was about four hours ago . Uh-huh . We want to help you catch this guy , but i 'm having a real hard time here . I mean , how exactly do you wind up chasing the suspect into my bathroom ? Don 't forget the suit . Yeah . And what do you need with my charcoal suit ? I 'm sorry , mr . Niemann . I 'm gonna have to call you back . - Um , i was just here . Where did i go ? - Huh ? There was a man . He looked exactly like me . Did you see where he went ? Down the hall . The men 's locker room . Thank you . Hey . Hey . Van blundht . Who ? Don 't think about it . Get your hands up . Turn around . Keep ' em up there . Put your hands down now . If it 's not you , i apologize in advance . What are you doing ? Pull your pants up . What ? What did i do now ? You 're the only ones here ? Yeah . I apologize . Only one of you is the man i 'm looking for . I hope . I gotta wait for some blood tests to come back , then i 'll release the other one . So just sit tight and relax . Keep your clothes on , huh ? Scully . Yeah , hey , it 's me . I think you should get down to the hospital right away , okay ? I 'm on my way . Good . You 're a damn good-looking man . You drew a gun on me . You handcuffed me ! I know what i did . With my own handcuffs . I 'm sorry . I have a serious problem with that . I still don 't understand . Do you think we look like criminals to you ? Exactly . What the hell was on your mind ? I said i was sorry . Am i done here ? Yeah . We got his description . Come on , guys . What the hell happened ? Van blundht surprised me . He cold-cocked me , and then got away . Got a lead on him ? No . The local authorities are already on the warpath for goin ' after one of their own . They 'll catch him eventually . So what , that 's it for us ? I know i dragged you out here , but i 'm beginning to think this is just a waste of time . Now you think there 's no x-file here ? No . No . I , i think the only thing that 's here is , uh , small potatoes . Hello ? Hello ! Get me out of here ! Hello ! Hello ! Down here ! Help ! Help ! Which one of you wrote this ? I did , sir . You spelled federal bureau of investigation wrong . It was a typo . Twice . Agent scully , what about the body you found ? Did you establish a cause of death ? Yes , sir . The subject , edward van blundht , sr . , died of natural causes . Specifically heart disease and advanced age . We think the son hid the father in the attic so he could continue ... to cash in on the old man 's social security checks . Most likely . So , the son wasn 't a murderer . - No , not at all . - But he was a rapist . I entered him into the national sex offenders data base . The west virginia state police have a photo and a description , and they will coordinate with local authorities . There should be an arrest soon . That about wraps it up . So , scully , what are you doin tonight ? Any big plans ? Seeing as how it 's friday , i was thinking i could get some work in ... on that monograph i 'm writing for thepenology review . You know , diminished acetylcholine production in recidivist offenders . Uh-huh . Actually , i might bag that , though . Really ? Yeah . I have to say , the anomalous musculature in the corpse we found ... really has me intrigued . In fact , i think i 'm going to go to quantico and have some tissue samples run . I 'll see you monday . Monday morning . " Fox " ? Brother ! Good night ! This is where my tax dollars go ? Where do i live ? Where the hell do i sleep ? Mulder ? Langley . You gotta see this . An on-line associate of ours , who will remain anonymous , has figured out a way to digitize the zagruder footage so he can extrapolate ... a bird 's-eye view at the daley plaza at the exact moment of the assassination . And you 'll never believe where the third shot came from . tell him about the cheese steaks. oh , yeah . Frohike , byers and me are goin ' out for cheese steaks . Are you down with that ? Uh , erase this once you hear it . Geeks for friends . Marty , it 's chantal . It 's been so long since we 've spoken , and i 've been so lonely not hearing your sexy voice . Marty , just for you , we 've lowered our rates to 40 cents a minute , two ninety-nine for the first minute , all long distance rates apply . Do give me a call , lover man . I 'll be waiting . F.b.i. F ... b ... i . F.b.i. You lookin ' at me ? There ain 't nobody else here . You must be lookin ' at me . You want a piece of this ? You 're a damn good-lookin ' man . Mulder , what 's up ? Scully , is this a bad time ? No . No , i 'm ... come on in . Who 's that for ? Uh ... us . Okay , have a seat . So , uh , what are you workin ' on ? More autopsy data . Everyone at the lab found mr . Van blundht pretty fascinating . We discovered an additional anomaly relating to the hair follicles in his scalp . I can 't even begin to guess at the nature of it ... until we can run it through the transmission electron microscope . Sounds very interesting . Yes , it is . Seriously , mulder . What 's going on ? You okay ? Mmm . Just kinda knockin ' around , and was just thinkin ' ... Uh , it 's good . We never really , uh , talk much , do we ? What do you mean ? Like ... really talk ? No , no , we don 't , mulder . What 's stopping us ? So there we are at 2 : 00 in the morning , me in my moray taffeta dress and marcus in whatever the hell he was wearing ... thank you very much . It had a kelly green cummerbund on it . Anyway , so i know that marcus is thinking that it 's now or never . And i 'm thinking ... what are you thinking ? I 'm thinking what is that siren i hear getting louder ? No way ! Who called the cops ? It wasn 't the cops . It was the fire department . My friend sylvia and her idiot prom date ... burwood ? Had built this campfire that went totally out of control . And so we all had to ride back on the , uh ... what do you call it ? The , uh , the pumper truck . Geez . Yeah . Marcus was the twelfth grade love of my life . I can 't believe i 'm telling you this . I don 't believe you haven 't told me before . Now i 'm seeing a whole new side of you , mulder . Is that a good thing ? I like it . Do you ever wish things were different ? What do you mean ? The person you wanted to be when you grew up , when you were in high school ? How far off from that did you end up ? Career wise ? Miles off target . Not just that . But do you ever wish ... that you could go back and do it all differently ? Do you ? Thanks for comin ' . What 's with the hat ? My court-appointed therapist makes me wear it . She says it 's meant to bolster my self-esteem . Does it ? Not really . The other inmates beat me up and take it from me , which would be okay except every week she brings me a new hat . Plus , they keep me on some kind of muscle relaxant ... so i , i can 't make faces the way i used to . Did you tell them to do that ? Is , uh , is agent scully here ? What did you wanna talk to me about , eddie ? I just think it 's funny . I was born a loser , but you 're one by choice . On what do you base that astute assessment ? Experience . You should live a little . Treat yourself . God knows i would if i were you . Have a good day , sir . I don 't imagine you need to be told this , mulder , but you 're not a loser . Yeah , but i 'm no eddie van blundht , either , am i ? I made this .

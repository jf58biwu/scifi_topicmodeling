 I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! What do you want ? I don 't know . Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Stop ! What ? What ? - It 's okay . Come here . What was in there ? - I have to figure things out . How many people are in this thing ? Why not ? Holy cats . Holy , holy cats . You alright ? Mister ? Worth ! Don 't worry . I hit my head . Let me take a look at that . I 'm a doctor . It doesn 't look bad . What the hell are you doing ? Hey , did you hear what I said ? Motion detectors . Into the walls . Tough to spot . Oh god , oh god , oh god . Wait a second . Let 's all just relax for a minute . Perogies . I was eating dinner . I don 't know . You ? Leaven ? I , I just went to bed and ... What about you ? I just woke up here . Who ? Then what is it ? - I don 't know . Aliens . Let 's rule out aliens for now and concentrate on what we know . My mom 's gonna freak . I won 't be there . She 'll freak . - What do you think , Rennes ? All right , I tend to agree . Shouldn 't we wait here ? - For what ? What about you ? Look around . Take a look . I got a feeling it 's looking at us . It 's a nightmare . Leaven . We can do this . We 've to be calm and work together . You 're a cop ? Boot it ! Clean . It sounded closer . It 's mechanical . It seems to come at regular intervals . Maybe it 's the ventilation system . No vents . - No kidding , I 'm boiling . What is it ? Serial numbers ? Room numbers . They 're different in each room . They have to feed us , don 't they ? Holloway . Suck on it . Keeps the saliva flowing . What ? - The air seems dry in there . Why didn 't the boot set it off ? The boot 's not alive . Detects hydrogen sulphide of the skin . Renn . Not Renz . It 's French . Fine , you 're French . How you ... He 's the Wren . You 're kidding , right ? You don 't have to think about nothing that 's not in front of you . Merde . Get him out ! Oh my god ! It was electro chemical . And he missed it . The Wren . Great ! We 've to reassess this place . Forget about all that ! You can 't have answers in here ! Just look at what 's in front of you . That 's what he said . We all have a role here . Leaven , what are you ? Nothing . I just go to school . What else ? - There 's nothing else . I live with my parents . I 'm boring . One down , four to go . What 's your purpose , Worth ? Often wondered that myself . I can 't stand that attitude . - Because he 's right . What 's your purpose , Quentin ? Kids , three of them . I haven 't made my peace yet . Nice , nice I 'm not giving up ! I 'm pissed off . They came into our homes ! They took my ring , they took oh , my amethyst . I wanna know who 's responsible . Your glasses ? You don 't need them ? They 're for reading . What can they mean ? 149 . Prime numbers . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . See what ? 645 , 645 ... That 's not prime . 372 ... no . 649 ... That room is safe . The incinerator room was prime 083 . You remember all that in your head ? I have a facility for it . Leaven , you beautiful brain . Boot it . Okay , out of the way . Brains before beauty . Safe , safe . Prime numbers ! Oh , how long have we been in here ? Nine or ten hours . How do you know ? Five o 'clock shadow . Last thing I remember was shaving . You got a date . Doin ' good . I need to smoke . I 'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk . Talk then . Have a conversation . What kind of doctor are you anyway ? You know , the free kind . She didn 't either . She 's not dead , we 're separated . These numbers aren 't prime . Okay , clear . Excuse me , sorry . No , I couldn 't . This one 's trapped too . We have to backtrack ? Not yet . Read them to me . It 's stuck . Look out . This room is green . Holloway ? Hi there . This room is green . Yes , it is . I wanna go back to the blue room . What is it ? Shock or what ? I think he 's mentally handicapped . I like the blue room . Jesus Christ . - He almost broke my neck . Butter first , then honey , Kazan . How 'd he survive ? - I wanna go back to the blue room . There 's lots of blue rooms . We 'll find you another real soon . This is too bizarre . Go on . I 'll look after him . Let 's not make him do the climbing thing now . Holloway ... Hol-lo-way . What are you talking about ? At least he 's good for something . Free clinic doctors ? You know what the establishment is ? Just guys like me . They don 't conspire , they buy boats This place is .. remember Scaramanga ? It 's a rich psycho 's entertainment . Is that what you think ? Clear . Gas ! - Holloway , get back here ! It 's OK . I just swallowed my button . I hate this . I hate this . It 's like cramming without coffee . She needs a break . - She can do it . They don 't look like prime to me . Is that your two bits worth , Worth ? For what it 's worth . Well ? - Well , he 's right . Not prime . Stop ! In front of you ! What is it ? Shut up ! Quentin , hold still . Leave the boots . Shut the fucking door ! How would he know ? So he has a bad attitude . This makes a spy of him ? He doesn 't like red rooms . So what happened ? Maybe they mean nothing at all . Well , we need to rest anyway . Are they telling you anything ? They 're no tarots . They don 't reveal themselves at once . They 're like people . Oh , gross . Well , he 's just peeing . Jesus Christ . Now it totally reeks in here ! Do you find this pretty funny ? What 's your fucking problem , Worth ? Even Holloway is better than you . Jawohl , Kommandant . And that somebody has to be you . Not all of us can play nihilist . Not all of us like to play hero . This is a will to live . A will to live . The warm feeling deep inside . Thanks . I 'm a new man . Poor Worth . Nobody loves me . Do it . Thought so . Fuck you Quentin ! You think we matter ? We don 't . You 're not getting out of here ! Yes , we are ! - No , you 're not ! Yes , we are ! - There is no way out of here ! Gotchya . How do you know that ? Answer the question , Worth . Oh , god . Who are you ? I 'm the poison . The shell . The sarcophagus . You built this thing ? I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell . A cube . A cube ? Why didn 't you tell us ? Worth . You 're lying . Was not at first . Who 's behind it ? I don 't know . Who hired you ? I didn 't ask . I never left my office . Bullshit . You knew from square one . No . That 's the way things work . One doesn 't know what the other does . The brain never comes out in the open . Whose brain ? It 's the same machine ! You do a little job in your office , I was right . All my life . We gotta get out to tell the truth ! Holloway , you don 't get it . Big brother is not watching you . What kind of fuckin explanation is that ? We have no idea what it is . - We know more than anybody else . Nobody wants to ask questions . I worked for months on this . It was a great job ! Why put people in it ? Because it 's here . You have to use it or you admit it 's pointless . But it is pointless . Quentin . That 's my point . What have we come to ? It 's so much worse than I thought . Not really . Just more pathetic . You make me sick , Worth . I make me sick too . We 're both part of the system . It 's like you said , Quentin . Let 's face it , the reason we 're here is that it 's out of control . This is how we ruin the world ? Well , I feel better . That 's why you stayed with us . To confess . Quentin ! Stop it ! Stop it ! We need him . What for ? Have you gone mad ? Worth . - Hi . So there 's this outer shell . - Yeah . Where ? - Wherever the door guy put it . And it 's sealed from the outside . What are dimensions of the outer shell ? One hundred and thirty-two square meters . May I ? Come on , honey , slide over . 5 by 5 by 5 meters . The inner cube can 't be flush with the shell wall , there 's a space . One cube ? I don 't know , it makes sense . The biggest the cube can be is ... 26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so 17.576 rooms . Seventeen thousand , five hundred and seventy-six rooms ? It makes me queasy . Descartes ! Leaven , you are a genius . What ? What ? Coded Cartesian co-ordinates . In English , slower . These numbers are markers , like latitude and longitude on a map . The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube . Well , where are we ? It works . All I have to do is add the numbers together . The X coordinates is 19 ... Y is 26 rooms ... So that places us seven rooms from the edge . All right , let 's go . Holloway , I 'm looking for solutions . Well , you haven 't found any yet . We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot . Worth will go first . No , he won 't ! We take turns ! Relax . Room for two in there ? What 's the matter ? These coordinates . 14 , 27 , 14 . What about ' em ? - They don 't make sense . If there are 26 rooms across , no coordinate can be larger than 26 . No , not outside of the cube . That means we 're not having dinner . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap ! Trap ! Sound activated . Lovely . How come the sound of the door opening didn 't set it off ? Must be rigged to ignore it . The edge is surrounded by traps . I say we cross the bitch . Right ! How many boots do we have left ? Get it off him . We know how it works . We just have to be quiet . That 's pretty fucking quiet . I 'm glad you 're on side , Worth , 'cause ... you 're up . He 's unpredictable . We 'll come back for him . But he 's a risk for us . Am I right ? Shame on you . Will you look at yourselves ? What have you turned into ? That 's all we got left . We 'll come back for him . That 's a lie and you know it . He 'll be quiet . No . - You go out , I 'm here . This way . You fucking fuck ! Let him go right now ! Let him go , you Nazi ! What did you call me ? Quentin , let that innocent boy go . You listen to me , woman . You 're always crying for something . I know your type . No kids , no man to fuck you . So you go around outraged , sniffing their business ! You missed your boat , Holloway . You 're all dried up inside there . That 's your fucking problem . How dare you say that to her ? You don 't know her , Quentin . None of us know each other here . Oh , I do . - No you don 't . No wonder your wife left you . All that bottled up anger . And a thing for young girls . God help you , Quentin . Did you smack your kids around too ? Open it . Door number six ? Net number one ? Door number two ? Open the fuckin ' thing . Oh , sunshine . Night time . My old friend , the shell . It 's there . Morning ! Hang on to me . I can 't see anything . Nothin ' to hang on to . We gotta try something . Let 's see if the door 's over there . Someone has to swing over there . Swing ? We make a rope out of clothes . I 'll tie it around myself . I 'll go . I 'm going , Holloway . She 's right , you 're too heavy . I 'm the lightest after Leaven . Anyway , it 's my turn . A couple of months . I am . David . Helen . You 're such a Helen . That 's as far as you go . There 's nothing down here . Hold tight . I try swinging over there . Okay , one more time . Hurry , you 're getting heavy . What the hell 's going on ? Get up here now ! Quentin ! - Have you got her ? She ... slipped . Shhh ... come on . Kazan . Will you please stop doing that ? You got to be strong , sweetheart . Don 't even talk to me . We gotta get down to the bottom . A long way with only one boot . But we 've to do it before we get too weak . You gotta keep cracking the numbers . It 's your gift . It 's not a gift . It 's just a brain . All right . One hour . An hour is as long as I say . What are you doing ? We have to reach the bottom . It 's quiet there , you can concentrate . You want to leave them ? - They 're traps , Leaven . Believe in me ! Try and see how my mind works . I can read people like an x-ray . I looked through the walls . I saw him working on this . We 're the purpose . The cube is us . We fit . Like numbers . A man and a woman . Two halves of the equation . I take you down , the perfect key . I slip you into the lock . Leaven , it 's time to go down . Get away from her . They 're fuckin ' spies . Holloway knew about my family ... You dropped her . Just go , Quentin . Give us the boot , you pig ! You don 't want the boot . You want to came with us , Worth ? Down the hatch . What the fuck 's with him ? How did ... It 's , it 's , it 's the Wren . It 's the old Wrenster . How could ... We 've been going around in circles . That can 't be . Where are we ? - I don 't know ! Where are we ? You figure it out ! Guess you were right , Worth . There is no way out of here . Get away from me . Wasn 't Rennes killed in that room ? How come there 's nothing out there ? It 's the edge . Fuck off ! Oh , that was good . What difference does it make ? We 're dead anyways . Of course . - The rooms ? It 's the only logical explanation . I 'm such an idiot ! The numbers are markers , points on a map , right ? Right . Permutations . Permu what ? A list of the coordinates that the room passes through . The numbers tell you all that ? I don 't know , All I saw was what the cube looked like before is started to move . Okay , so it 's moving . How do we get out ? 27 . I know where the exit is . Where ? You remember the room that had the coordinate larger than 26 ? What about it ? That placed the room outside . A bridge . What are you talking about ? The room starts off as a bridge , So , when does it open ? Don 't . That 's it ! This room moves to zero , 1 and - 1 on the X-axis . 2 , 5 and - 7 on Y. And 1 , and - 1 and zero on Z. And what does that mean ? You suck at math ? I need the room numbers around us . 666 , 897 , 466 . 567 , 898 . And 545 . Did you get that ? 656 , 778 , 462 . That 's enough . X is 17 . Y is 25 and Z is 14 . This room makes 2 more moves before returning to its original position . Do we have time ? - Maybe . Then let 's go ! You threw out our last boot . Can you calculate that ? The numbers are huge . I 'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set . Maybe if I had a computer . I 'm not dying in a rat maze ! Look at the numbers . I can 't factor them ! Even 5 , 67 ! It 's astronomical ! 2 . Astronomical . Before that . Factor . How many factors Kazan ? Of 5,6,7 . - 2 . What , are you fucking kidding ? How many factors does 30 have ? - 3 . How about 7 ? - 1 . Gum drop . I don 't have any gum drops . Gum drops . Gum drops come in bags . OK in bags . I don 't like the red ones . 898 . - 2 . 545 . - 2 . He 's giving us the factors . Astronomical . So this idiot would be a genius ? By those numbers it should be safe . Only one way to find out . Don 't ! Safe . Kazan , my man . What 's the number ? Right here , look here ! Make him do it ! Kazan , we 're gonna do some numbers . Prime numbers . And the factor of 656 ? - 2 . 779 ? - 2 . 462 ? - 3 . Clear . Move ! Let 's go . You too , Worth ! Go ! - Worth ! 563 ! Please , Kazan , 563 ? - You fuckers , you 're dead ! 2 . - Clear ! 1 . - Trapped ! Check the floor . - Is he dead ? Where is he ? Come here . I said come here now ! Gotchya . That way . 2 . - Clear ! 4 . - Clear ! That proves our theory . Numbers . 423 . - Clear . Listen . He hasn 't moved far . I 'll go find him . What do you think ? You don 't have a lot of lives left . I didn 't move . I don 't like that . 14 , 26 , 14 . Worth , get back here right now ! Deal . This room 's going to the bridge ! We 're coming ! Over here ! We don 't have much time . This better be it . It should be . Where ? Oh , no ! Give me a minute . Be patient . This is the room we started in . The bridge . Red . 424 . - Clear ! Go ahead . It 's not your fault ! What is out there ? Boundless human stupidity . I can live with that . Get out through the door ! Red , Kazan ! A cube ... 26 rooms high . 26 rooms across . 17,576 rooms ? ! FEAR Do you remember how you got here ? PARANOIA I wanna wake up ! SUSPICION Motion detectors into the walls . Tough to spot . DESPERATION We can 't get out of here . Yes , we are ! There is no way out ! We need to get around the traps . Prime numbers identify them . I 'm not dying in a rat maze ! No more talking , no more guessing . THE WALLS What the hell is going on ? ARE CLOSING IN We are the key ... The cube is us . Spelling checked by TripleA

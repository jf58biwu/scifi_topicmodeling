 I 'll take that , Jarod . Why have you been stealing these ? I 've been making this . - A house ? - A home . This is where I grew up . At least what I can remember . What 's a home like , Sydney ? [ Miss Parker ] Since when do lab rats wear Hugo Boss ? This is like something out of GQ . How would you know ? There must be 20,000 dollars ' worth of designer clothes here . It appears you have a fashion competitor , Miss Parker . What 's he up to , Syd ? A form of expression , individuality , strength ... showing offhis colors the way a mating animal would . You might be right about the mating part . " The Kama Sutra of Love . ' " What 's your boy learning from this ? I have always depended on the kindness of strangers . - Jarod . - Isabella . I 've heard that chivalry was dead . Only slightly wounded . Do you prefer to be called " escort " or " gigolo " ? Well , why don 't you give me one hour ... and you tell me . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Why leave all of this behind ? Jarod operates on a different level than other people . [ Broots ] It all must mean something . It always does . You guys better come take a look at this . Follow me to 1500 Hart Street . It seems pretty simple . Let 's find out . Your cut . - Did The Kama Sutra come in handy ? - I lent my copy to a friend . Well , you must have memorized it . A gift from Isabella . - What the hell did you do to that woman ? - I just listened . I can 't decide who gets you next . I hear Cynthia Sloan is looking . European countess to Detroit socialites ? Just because she 's the only woman in Forbes 50 ... doesn 't mean I can 't satisfy her . Remember , Jarod ... they 're paying for a fantasy , not paying for a man . Do you think you can become someone else ? I 'll do my best . [ Man ] It spells out the terms of your employment . For obvious reasons , you 're being hired as a , um - Special consultant . Everything you see and do is strictly confidential . Of course . It 's quite a house . - You should see the other six . - Seven . - Hello . I 'm Jarod . - He sign ? It 's a requirement of Frank 's . He oversees all my holdings and new ventures . - And which one am I ? - You 'd be a little of both . Well ... let the games begin . Let 's lay the ground rules . You 're here for one reason . Men have a tendency to hit on me . You 're going to save me the inconvenience . You 're a prop , Jarod . - A piece of jewelry . - Oh . Then I 'll have to shine . Well , for $ 5,000 a week , I expect you to blind me . You 'll be on call until the ribbon cutting on Saturday . - For that ? - Sloan Towers , the future of downtown Detroit . Well , if this is the future ... then this must be history . [ People Chanting ] Save our home ! Save our home ! Save our home ! Save our home ! Save - What 's it like to have a home , Sydney ? Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! [ Pigeon Cooing ] [ Clicking Tongue ] Leave him alone . - He broke his wing . - I wish Michael was here . Michael Edwards . The boy that fell from the fire escape . He helped the birds . He was gonna be a veterinarian when he grew up . I was a veterinarian once . - Can you make him fly again ? - I don 't know . TracyJohnson , you get off of this roof right now . ! - I gotta go . - The girl 's gonna get herself killed . I run the Neighborhood Watch program in this building , and your face doesn 't look familiar . I was just trying to help the bird . I guess that Michael Edwards cared for them . - What do you know about Michael ? - Just what I 've read . This is where it happened . I told that boy a thousand times to stay off this roof . My name is Jarod . - I 'm Alice Evans . - Nice to meet you , Alice Evans . Three stories he fell , straight down . And then they condemned this place . Now Cynthia Sloan can get her manicured claws ... on the only raw property left in the city . And throw hundreds of families out of their homes . Fire escapes . They don 't collapse under the weight of an eight-year-old boy . The city said it was the weather . I 've been living down in 212 for nearly 40 years . Suddenly , the bricks start crumbling like sawdust ? Uh-uh . I don 't think so . I only wish I 'd been around to help that boy . [ Pager Beeping ] I can 't take on another client . I 'm at Cynthia Sloan 's beck and call night and day . Don 't worry about it . This one sounds like a one-shot deal . But you 're not gonna get away with talking this time . This one 's got the itch . - The itch ? - Go scratch it . [ Doorbell Rings ] Yes ? I have always depended on the kindness of strangers . - What ? - The service sent me . The service . Right . Oh , that was quick . Um - - Uh , may I come in ? - Yes . Please . Won 't you come in ? " Happy Valentine 's Day . " Help yourself . I made coffee . - It 's French roast . - Oh . How do you know what 's inside of them ? - Oh , you don 't . That 's the fun part . - Oh . Wh-Who is Valentine ? [ Laughs ] You know , they didn 't say you 'd be handsome and funny . The truth is , uh , I 've never , uh , done anything like this , uh - Um , now , do I , uh ... make the check out to you personally ? Oops . Or do I make it out to the service ? We can figure that out later . I 'll make it out to " Cash . " I couldn 't help but notice the man living over the garage . Oh , that was Howard , my husband . - Your husband ? - Soon to be ex . He 's living above the garage until we settle things . Oh , I almost forgot . I bought a box at the drugstore . - It was on special , so - - The 12-pack . Safety first . I saw that on MTV . - You seem a little nervous , Joyce . - Nervous ? No . No , not me . Mm-mmm . I love a house with pictures . It makes it feel like a home . I sent my last one off to college this year . Oh , I miss him . Can 't say the same for Howard . - Was it another woman ? - Oh , hardly . You know what Howard bought me for my 25th wedding anniversary ? - Hm . - A toaster . I saved up and bought us tickets to Paris ... kind of like a second honeymoon . Howard couldn 't take off time from work ... so he cashed in the tickets and bought a big-screen TV . Fifty inches . French roast is the closest I 'll ever get to Paris . Now , I hear that I get what I pay for . So - You must miss your children . - Hmm ? What ? - Do they know ? - Know ? - That you 've hired a lover ? [ Woman On TV ] The accidental death of Michael Edwards ... led the city to condemn Jefferson Heights . These residents are protesting their eviction . In four days , their homes will be demolished . For some of them , it 's déjà vu . They tried the same thing after the fire of ' 77 . The tenants fought then , and they won . Back then , the residents won renovation instead of demolition . But then they never had to deal with real estate mogul Cynthia Sloan . Miss Sloan , can we get a statement from you ? My heart goes out to Michael Edwards and his family . ButJefferson Heights is dangerous . I 'm doing the city and all the residents a favor . Some say that after Michael Edwards died , you strong-armed the city into a contract . Sloan Development won this bid fair and square . I make no excuses for being competitive . You do what it takes to close the deal . Whatever it takes . - Miss Sloan ! Miss Sloan ! - [ Man ] You haven 't really answered the question . [ Reporters Chattering ] Whatever it takes . [ Jarod ] What 's all this sulfuric chloride for ? We 'll be using it in the demolition . Soak the right stress points , then it weakens the brick . That whole building will come down like a house of cards . Excuse me . - Uh , one more question . - Shoot . Valentine 's Day . Specifically , Cupid . Yeah ? A corpulent infant who happens to be an archer ... goes around shooting arrows into people , and suddenly they 're in love ? - That 's about it . - And to show that love ... people buy each other chocolates and other sweets . Do they wanna be fat like the infant ? What was it you said you did for Miss Sloan ? Uh , special consultant . - Sounds dangerous . - You have no idea . Bye . [ Broots ] The address Jarod left on the candy was to an adult bookstore ? You have got to be kidding me . Let 's just get this over with . - What 's wrong , Broots ? - It 's kind of embarrassing . I 've never been in this kind of place before . Right . And I 'm the president of the P.T.A. It 's all starting to come back to you , isn 't it , Broots ? Jarod must have brought us here for a reason . It 's called " humiliation . " Is there anybody here ? I 'll be right with you . We 'd like to speak to the owner about a friend . Rex is the owner . He 's dead . I 'm Bucky LaFontaine . I run the place . You mentioned something about a friend ? He left these . Why didn 't you say you were looking forJarod in the first place ? Come on . Come on back . Anybody hungry ? Yeah , Jarod was a real emotional guy . Smart though . He invented the portable smoke-eater . [ Whirring ] Sure you don 't want me to grill you a wing ? Positive . Do you know whereJarod went ? Not a clue . He just stopped coming in . Would you say that he was interested in the material you sell ? No way . He wasn 't into the sexuality part . He just wanted to talk about people - about what makes us want each other . Between you and me , I don 't think that boy got much love growing ' up . I think that 's why he must 've been so proud of the book . The book ? I run a small publishing company on the side . Romance novels and such . Are you saying Jarod actually wrote one of these novels ? Yeah . Uh , there . He - He did the cover art too . [ Laughing ] That boy 's definitely one of a kind . One is enough . This 'll look stunning on him . Have this ready for tonight . [ Chuckles ] You 're not very big on pictures , are you ? You 've got a lot of awards , but only one photograph . Photographs - They make a house a home . Don 't you think ? [ Chuckles ] - Is this you ? - [ Chuckles ] My father bred racehorses as a hobby . Ouch . That looks painful . My prize steed threw me . I still have the scar . It used to be much worse , but the plastic surgeons keep whittling away at it . So , where 's your family ? You ask your clients this many questions ? Only the special ones . Don 't you get lonely here ? The city turned down our demolition plan . I 've called a meeting . I don 't have time to get lonely . Don 't be late tonight . [ Phone Rings ] - Hello . - [ Woman ] Yes . I spoke with Joyce . She said she was vaguely unfulfilled . What is wrong with you ? She 's a housewife . You nibble on her ear , she melts . I don 't know exactly what she wants . If you call a plumber , you want your pipes fixed . She called a gigolo . - I understand , but - - Fix her pipes . And , Jarod ... I don 't wanna have this conversation again . All right ? - [ Dial Tone ] - [ Beeps Off ] I just got her washed . What do you think ? - [ Alarm Chirps ] - It 's the car . It drives her crazy . - [ Soft ] - Joyce ? Hi there . Rumor has it you 're feeling vaguely unfulfilled . I 've been waiting for you . You do realize that your husband is out in the garden . I know . You won 't regret this later ? To hell with regrets . [ Car Alarm Blaring ] [ Alarm Stops ] I know you 're up there , Howard Cullman ! I 'm calling the police ! The number 's 911 ! Oh ! Oh , I 'm so sorry . - It 's - It 's okay . - Oh . - It 's strange though . - Strange ? What ? You say your husband doesn 't care about you anymore . It sure doesn 't look that way to me . Hey . ! Jarod . I didn 't mean to bite your head off . I thought you were another one of those inspectors . Inspector ? I don 't think you 'll be seeing many more of those . - Your home is already condemned . - Are you kidding ? Those bureaucrats were all over this place , even before Mikey fell . Somebody inspected the fire escape before it collapsed ? Yeah . He was independently wealthy , like you . Like me ? He had one of those fancy hunks of metal on his wrist too . - Like this ? - Except his had diamonds . Excuse me . I would like to propose a toast . First of all , to this work of art that some people call a building . The sign may say Sloan Towers , but this entire project ... was the dream of my right-hand man , Frank Linden . This has been his baby from the beginning ... and if I don 't give him a promotion for this , then I should fire myself . [ Guests Chuckle ] When everyone said that it couldn 't be done ... including me , Frank found a way . To Sloan Towers . Whatever it takes . Hear , hear . [ Woman ] Cheers . Whatever it takes . [ Siren Wailing ] - [ Sighs ] - [ Pigeon Cooing ] Hey ! [ Clicking Tongue ] How you feeling today ? Would you like one of these ? They 're very good . [ Pager Beeping ] [ Sighs ] Have you ever tried one of these ? It says , " Be mine . " Got one that says , " You 're fired " ? Fired ? I 'm tired of calls from this house-frau Cullman . You 're through with her and with Cynthia Sloan . I 'm assigning a replacement . Just before the ribbon cutting . Do you think that 's smart ? Cynthia Sloan is one of your prize clients . Fine . You wanna keep Cynthia ? Then scratch the housewife 's itch . - [ Sighs ] - [ Phone Rings ] - This is Sydney . - [ Jarod ] Why do people fall in love ? You might as well ask why the stars come out at night . Everyone spends their whole life searching ... for that special someone - that person to love . But when they finally find them , it all falls apart . It 's a paradox , isn 't it ? But I believe it 's better to have loved and lost ... than never to have loved at all . So , you believe that love is worth fighting for . That it 's worth the pain and the effort ? Is that what you were trying to say in the romance novel you left for Miss Parker ? The book speaks for itself , Sydney . - [ Dial Tone ] - [ Beeps Off ] [ Jarod 's Voice ] " She felt consumed by a great void - a dark and silent abyss ... as terrifying as the grand palace around her . But somewhere in the chilling blackness ... she caught a glimpse of a light . She remembered a time - the precocious little girl with a heart full of fire ... a soul inflamed by passion ... and a smile that could melt winter into spring . But the light was gone . The flame had died . Her past was taken from her by the soldiers of the great palace . She would continue searching , hoping to rekindle the fire . Until then , she would always be the Saddest Little Valentine . ' " [ Tones Beeping ] Hello , Joyce ? This is Jarod . [ Knocking ] Come on in . [ Chuckles ] [ Laughing ] It isn 't quite what I imagined . Nothing ever is . - Can I pour you a drink ? - Hmm ? Uh - [ Stammering ] Yes , sure . - [ Whirring ] - [ Giggles ] Oh , that vibrates . Oh , my gosh . - [ Whirring Stops ] - We 'll get to that later . - [ Soft ] - [ Quietly ] Oh my - Now it 's just you ... and me . No one can disturb us , especially that annoying husband of yours . Uh - - What 's with you , Joyce ? That 's what you 're here for . - Ah . Don 't tell me you 're thinking about Howard . That husband doesn 't deserve you . - Well - - I mean , how much polyester can one man wear anyway ? Poly-What ? And that physique . ! [ Chuckles ] What is it , body by chili dog ? Well , you know , Howard , he 's a little chunky . - He is . - Santa Claus is chunky . Howard , he 's a zoning violation . Well , you know , Howard h-has his faults ... but he 's a kind ... and gentle human being , and - - He bought you a toaster for your anniversary . - Well - He cashed in your tickets to Paris for a television set . Well , 50 inches actually . You know , that 's just Howard . Forget about him . Forget about that whole nightmare . You know , Jarod , y-you just don 't forget about 25 years of marriage . We 've been through a lot . We raised a family . We - Made a home ? You 're right . You don 't forget about 25 years of marriage . And you don 't forget a home . Some people , they can go through their whole lives ... without ever having one . Come on . I 'll take you home . [ Quietly ] Thank you . [ Sydney ] What 's wrong , Jarod . You seem upset . You 've been sitting here , staring for hours . Tell me what 's wrong . No ! No ! No . ! No . ! - Jarod , what are you doing ? - I don 't have a home , Sydney ! I can 't remember anything ! I don 't have a home ! I don 't have a home . ! I don 't have a home . ! [ People Chanting ] Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home ! Save our home ! So much anger . Don 't they realize it 's not safe to live there anymore ? That 's easy for you to say . If this place started falling down ... you 'd have six others to choose from . They don 't have what you have - a great education ... rich parents , your own horses . - People change . - Some more than others . - [ Chanting Continues ] - [ Frank ] Cynthia . ! Cynthia , are you watching this ? - They won 't leave . - They can 't . I want your permission to call the police . - That would look great on the news . - Please ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Look , Cynthia , these people are breaking a city ordinance . Now , I can have Alderman Nance call the chief , set it all in motion . Go talk to them . Tell them that their building is unsafe . Explain it to them face-to-face . - They won 't listen . - Then call the police . Start a riot . Whatever it takes . Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! Save our home . ! We won 't go ! We won 't go ! We won 't go ! We won 't go ! - I 've been expecting you . - We won 't go ! - Hello , Jarod . - Alice . - What is going on here ? - We won 't go ! [ Knocking ] - Hi , Jarod . - This is Cynthia . You the lady that 's gonna tear down my house ? Jarod said you like horses . I found this when we moved in . It was in a secret hiding place . Wanna see ? How 'd you know ? That 's you . You 're Cindy . [ Cynthia ] How did you know ? You can find just about anything ... if you know the right place to look for it . Who are you ? Someone who believes that everyone deserves to have a home ... even Cindy Morgan . I changed my name , but I didn 't hurt that little boy . No , but you 're partly responsible . Why are you so determined to destroy this place ? - It 's where you grew up . - That was my past . So you thought you could just get rid of it ? Like you got rid of your name or that scar on your arm ? Trust me . You can 't cut a scar out of here . I 've tried . With all the houses that I own ... that little room was the only place that I ever called home . But now you 're rich , and you have this image to maintain . When I was a kid , I won scholarships to very expensive schools . I was around a lot of very wealthy people . So to fit in , you felt like you had to make up a life . Trust me . I know the feeling . First , it was that my father bred racehorses ... instead of what he really did ... which was drive rich tourists around downtown in his horse and buggy . Then it was my name . The lies just snowballed . Now it 's too late for the truth . Cindy , it 's never too late for the truth . Two tickets on the Concorde , please . Hi . I 'm your wife 's gigolo ... and do I have a deal for you . Cynthia ? Cynthia ? This is great . [ Laughs ] Cynthia ? Hmm ? [ Shouts ] [ Jarod ] Bad year for sulfuric chloride . [ Sighs ] - What are you doing here ? - I 'm celebrating , Frank . Because today , you were fired . What the hell are you - [ Shouts ] I hope you brought your golden parachute . - [ Clanging ] - [ Shouts ] Better hold on , Frank . You don 't wanna go down with your career . [ Grunting ] Sulfuric chloride , ideal for the demolishing of a building ... murdering children . My God , help me . I bet your cronies down in Public Housing say it was the weather . Right , Frank ? You killed a child , just so you could force people out of their homes ... just so you could make more money . - You 're crazy . - No , Frank . You are . This is where Michael Edwards plunged to his death ... just like you 're about to do . Help me , Jarod . I can 't hold on much longer . Like you helped Michael Edwards ? [ Whimpering ] I have money . I hate to tell you , Frank , but I 'm not really a gigolo ... so I can 't be bought . But I am curious . How much ? How much to throw hundreds of people out of their homes ? How much to murder an innocent little boy ? All right . All right , Jarod . I did it , okay ? I did it . Now , please , help me . - Help me . ! - [ Sighs ] [ Grunting ] - [ Shouts ] - Nice watch . Ah-ah-ah . Don 't waste your time with those . - Trust me . - [ Laughs ] - Ah . You really know how to show a lady a good time , Jarod . - [ Both Laugh ] - You haven 't seen nothing yet . - Hey , you . [ Pigeon Cooing ] - You think he 'll fly ? - We 'll see . - [ Gasps ] - I 'm gonna go chase it . Is that allowed ? I don 't wanna go back to that huge house by myself . It gets really lonely . [ Door Opens , Closes ] [ Alice ] Time 's up . Hey , what 's happenin ' ? Are we going over these renovation plans or what ? - Whatever it takes . - Yeah . I 'm comin ' , I 'm comin ' . [ Phone Rings ] What ? They say it is better to have loved and lost ... than never to have loved at all . - Do you believe that 's true ? - If you 're lonely , call a 900 number . - Did you read my book ? - I skimmed through it . You paint a pretty sad picture . - I just write the way I see it . - [ Scoffs ] - How did we end up like this ? - Like what ? Alone . Searching . It 's ironic , because we both want the same things - someone to care about , someone to care about us . [ Sighs ] Do you think we 'll ever find that kind of love in our lives ? What the hell do you want from me , Jarod ? [ Sighs ] - Open the box . - [ Beeps Off ] [ Man Singing ] [ Continues ] [ Ends ]

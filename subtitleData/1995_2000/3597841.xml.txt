 Evan ! Evan ! Where are you ? ! Evan ! Evan ! Evan ! - Evan , hurry ! Please ! - Nothing 's coming out ! ... with winds in excess of 100 miles per hour . Currently , the storm system is stalled 25 miles off the Florida coast . Again , the hour 's lead story , Tropical Storm Leroy has been upgraded to Hurricane Leroy . The entire Gulf Coast is bracing for its arrival . Damn it ! Mom , is Dad going to be all right ? Mom ? What about Dad ? - Mom , what about Dad ? ! - We need water . Right now ! - Mom ! - Just do as I say , Evan ! Come help me ! Help me pull the washer out , please , Evan , just help me . - Mom , Reggie 's back here ! - Evan , let the cat alone ! All right , unplug the machine , honey . Unplug the machine . Pull that hose out of the wall . I 'm going to pull . I need you to get behind the machine and push . I 'm going to pull , you push . We 're going to tip the washing machine over . We need to dump the water out . All right , honey , push ! Push ! Push , Evan ! Push , Evan ! Are you pushing ? Evan ! Evan , answer me ! Evan ... Mom ! Evan ! Let him go ! Let go of him ! Let go of him ! Let him go ! Let him g ... Hi , this is Fox Mulder . You can leave me a message after the beep . Agent Mulder , this is Arthur Dales calling from Florida . I don 't know if you 're watching the news but we 're in for a hell of a blow in the next 12 to 24 . I been through hurricanes , Mulder , been through the alphabet . But I just got a distress call from my neighbor down the road to set my teeth on edge . You don 't have much time to get to the airport but if you 're the X-Files man you say you are you better get your butt in gear . ... a spokesman for the Collier County Emergency Response Team is advising residents to stay off the roads and either wait out the storm in a secure location or proceed to a county emergency shelter . Hurricane Leroy remains some 20 miles off the Gulf Coast sending high winds and up to six inches of rain onto coastal communities . As of yet , it has unleashed none of its potential heavy destruction on a very nervous populace from Naples to Fort Myers . The National Weather Service predicts Hurricane Leroy will make landfall in the next three to four hours , and we 'll be coming back to you in a few minutes- - We got no sign of anything amiss here at that residence out on the spit . Place is all boarded up tight , over . Roger that . Maybe the occupants have evacuated , over . Well , that would be the Shipleys , but a neighbor called and says they couldn 't have gone too far without their only vehicle which is still in the carport out here , over . - Well . That sounds like a real mystery , don 't it ? - It sure does , you dumb fathead . Well , it couldn 't be that all the planes out were fully loaded , huh ? Mr. Dales , there 's a reason that people don 't head out into hurricanes . Yeah . The hurricane 's 20 miles offshore . - Mr. Dales , can we come in ? - Come in . Who 's this ? Special Agent Dana Scully . - Scully ? - She 's my partner . Well , don 't get too comfortable . You 're going to want to get right back out there . Out where ? - Did you tell her what I told you ? - Yes , but she 's ... She 's not the type that 's easily persuaded . Is that so ? What he means is I don 't hear a story about a sea monster and automatically assume it 's the Lord 's gospel truth . - Why did you bring her here ? - Well , she knows your reputation , your early work on the X-Files and she has a knack for getting to the bottom of things . Apparently , so does Mr. Dales . It 's a good thing I have a reputation . Otherwise , how could it be impugned ? Look , Mr. Dales , I 'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm . I listened to the message that you left for Agent Mulder about your friends . The Shipleys- - a young couple with a son . Yeah , he lives out on the end of the sandspit . Sara called me in a panic . She said that something in the house had grabbed Jack , her husband . - In the bathroom , you said ? - Yeah ... of all places . It was your description that caused Agent Scully 's ... dubiousness . No . Not my description . No . That was Sara 's . She said ... that it had tentacles wrapped around her husband 's neck and choking him . And you have no reason to doubt Ms. Shipley 's report ? No . Both she and Jack are marine biologists . Or at least they were . I fear the worst . She 's missing , too ? Uh-huh . Yeah . I got on the horn to the local constabulary but they 're about as helpful as a fart in a windstorm . I would have gone out there myself but for my bad hip . It 's not a night that anybody should be out in . Well , I don 't see that there 's a choice . If anyone wants to get to the bottom of all this ... What is it that brought you out here in the first place , Mr. Dales ? I came down for the weather . Don 't sneer at the mysteries of the deep , young lady . The bottom of the ocean is as deep and dark as the imagination . SHIPLEY RESIDENCE 9 : 14 PM Hello ! Mrs. Shipley ! At least it looks like they had the time and the presence of mind to prepare for the hurricane . The place is all boarded up . It 's from the inside . It makes you wonder how they got out . Hello ! Mrs. Shipley ! Mulder ... No sign of life . There 's ... something on the drainpipe . I can 't get it off . I don 't know if I 'm going to need my gun or a harpoon here . How the hell did the cat get in the washing machine ? Maybe he was taking a dip ... After he finished boarding up the windows . Where do you think this leads to ? Must be the bathroom . Dales told me the wife told him that the ... the husband was grabbed from the bathroom . - Mr. Shipley ! - Can you give me a hand with this ? Well , howdy do ! Yeah . Right like that . Keep your hands up there where I can see them . Now who are you and what the hell do you think you 're doing ? Yeah . Nice and slow . You can put the gun down . We 're FBI . - Don 't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida . - Sir , we 're Agents Scully and Mulder . - I can show you my ba- - - This is Deputy Greer . I 'm out at the Sandspit Road . I 've got two suspects over at the Shipley residence . B and E , possible foul play , over . - We 're out here like you . We 're ... - Copy that , 54 . Be advised we have no backup units available . Roger that . I 'm putting you under arrest . - We 're out here looking for the Shipleys , too . - You have the right to remain silent . - Arthur Dales called us . - Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have a right to a lawyer . If you don 't have one ... Does that name mean anything to you ? Arthur Dales ? - I know Dales . - All right . I got a call from him , too . Drunk as a skunk . What 's new ? Well , what else would we be doing out here on a night like this ? You could be looters . For all I know , you could be part of the Manson family . - Oh , no . You 're gonna kill me . - No , I 'm not , but I 'd like to . Deputy ... The FBI ? For real ? I 'll be in the car . I gotta at least make out a report . No , no , no . Not before you help me finish what you interrupted . Yes , sir . May I have my gun , please ? Thank you . Yeah . No ... Thank you . No one in the bathroom . The deputy helped me pull off the plywood . There 's no sign of anything except more of that slime in the bathtub and maybe three inches of water on the floor . It 's weird . It 's like somebody left the taps running before they boarded up the door . Great . Mulder , they 're threatening to close the airport . I think we better get out of here . - Aren 't you even curious what happened to these people ? - Yes , I 'm curious , Mulder , but I 'm also suspicious . I mean , I ... I think that Mr. Dales ' story is fueled by more than his imagination and not much deeper than the bottom of a highball . Don 't dismiss him so easily . He discovered the X-Files 40 years ago . He 's seen things that I 've only read about . Because sea monsters can only be read about , Mulder , because they don 't exist . If the sea is where life began , where our ancestors first walked ashore , then who 's to say what new life may be developing in its uncharted depths . You know what ? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family . Mulder , look , there is nothing more for us to do here . There 's nothing that the local law enforcement can 't do for us . I mean , these people are missing . There 's nowhere else to look . I 've done my duty for-for Mr. Dales , for my conscience ... I mean , haven 't you ? Well , we should at least tell him that we 're giving up ... shouldn 't we ? Sea monsters ... FBI agents ... I 'm the one who could use a drink . How do you do , folks ? You 're going to have to turn around and find yourself someplace dry to spend the night . - What 's the problem , officer ? - The road 's washed out up ahead . This is an emergency ! I understand , ma 'am , but unless your car has wings there 's no getting through on this road . Well , what about the airport ? Is there an alternate route ? Airport ? Not tonight . This hurricane 's really bearing down on us . We got trees , power lines down all over the place . You folks really shouldn 't be out here . I want you to drive to the first safe place you can find . You understand ? Sir , it 's important that we evacuate the area . We 're FBI agents and we need to get to where we 're going . Don 't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida . - I 'd be happy to show you my I.D ... - Thank you very much , sir . I appreciate the concern . - Mulder . - I was just one howdy do over the line . THE BREAKERS CONDOMINIUMS 10 : 42 PM Car 54 , please report back to base . Yeah , this is car 54 . I 'm over at Nance Road , over . We 're asking all mobile units to stay off the roads due to extreme weather conditions forecast for the next three to four hours including a flash flood warning now in effect for Collier County . Over . 10-4 . I 'm going to make a quick stop in at the Breakers condo complex . Looks like some folks are stranded without power , over . It 's Deputy Greer , County Sheriff . If you 're home , please answer the door . If you can hear me , but you can 't answer the door , call 911 , tell them you need help . Hello ? It 's Deputy Greer , County Sheriff . If you 're home , answer the door . If you can hear me , but can 't answer the door , call 911 , tell them you need help . Hello ? Hello ? Somebody here ? Sir ? Ma 'am ? - Hello ? - The good thing about zero visibility , Scully ? - Can 't get any worse . - Is this the Collier County Sheriff ? Yes . Oh , hi . We 're driving on , uh ... Nance Road ... N-A-N-C-E Road . Nance Road . No , it isn 't very smart , is it ? No ... Yes , that would be much appreciated . He 's going to guide us to the nearest emergency shelter . Not a moment too soon . Hello ? Hello ... No service . You know , Scully , someday we 're gonna look back on this and we 're gonna laugh . We 'll just think of it as , uh ... you know man pitted against the forces of nature . Think of it as a test of our mettle . I don 't need my mettle tested . - What was that ? - I think that was a-a tree branch . Debris is starting to fly . Mulder , we have to pull over . We have to wait out this storm somewhere away from the trees . We 're not going to dodge any trees in a parked car . At least if we 're driving , we 're a moving target . We don 't know where we are and we don 't know where we 're going . There 's somebody , I think , who 's about to give us directions . Who says there 's never a cop when you need one ? - Mulder , isn 't that ... - Forrest Gump . Deputy ? Hello ? Anybody ... Mulder , he 's in here . Can you talk to me ? You 're having trouble breathing ? This man needs a trach or he 's going to die real soon . I 've heard of passing the time ... Ouch . Mulder , I need you to hold his head real steady . Deputy , just try and relax . Okay . Here we go . Looks like he was attacked or stung . What are those ? I don 't know but he 's having a reaction which is affecting his autonomic response . Whatever it was , I think it came through the plumbing , through the toilet . All I know is we have to get a medivac unit out here as soon as possible . If it 's in the plumbing I got to make sure nobody else is in this building . This is Special Agent Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . I need a medivac unit out here ASAP . I have an officer in need of emergency medical assistance . - Please state your name again , ma 'am . - My name is Dana ... Scully . - Scully ! Oh , God . - I 'm a medical doctor requesting a medivac unit for a sheriff 's deputy who is injured . You have a deputy down ? I have a deputy who 's been attacked by something as yet unidentified . - Unidentified ? My ass ! - What 's his condition , ma 'am ? His vitals are weak and he 's in shock . Now , I need him taken to a hospital right away . Excuse me , sir . Is everything okay in your apartment ? - Uh , yeah , yeah . It 's all good . - Do you need some help ... with your television ? I thought I heard voices . Thank God ! We didn 't think anybody was coming . Are you the doctors ? - No . Do you need medical help ? - Yeah . We called 911 , but no one came and everyone else is already evacuated . We don 't have a car and then the phone died . - Who 's we ? Who are you talking about ? - My wife and I. She 's pregnant , a week past her due date . - God , I hope one of you has a car . - You don 't know this man , mister ... ? Uh , Suarez . Walter Suarez . Uh , no . He 's not with you ? - I 'll put it back . - Yeah . Everything in your pockets , too . She 's right over here . Right this way . - Angela this is , uh , Mister ... - Mulder . Stay there , Mrs. Suarez . We 're going to make sure your baby makes it safely into the world . Well , thank you , but I 'm not in labor . And my name is not " Suarez " . It 's Villareal . He tells people I 'm his wife . Like he 's so macho . Walter , Angela ... I 'm going to have to ask you to leave your apartment and come downstairs with me . Why ? You got a car ? Oh , Walter , here , doesn 't have a car . Not to mention a job . Right now , I just want to get you someplace where I know you 'll be safe . From what ? I don 't know but whatever it is it may have seriously injured a sheriff 's deputy . - Who ? Where ? - In the manager 's apartment . - It could be in the complex 's plumbing right now . - In the plumbing ? That 's great . I have to go to the bathroom about every ten seconds . Kid 's going to be a fighter . Anybody else in the complex that you know of ? - No , no one ... Oh , there 's George . - George ? Yeah , George Vincent . He lives on the first floor . I went and asked him for help but he just yelled " go away " . He never listens to no one . - He 's going to want to listen to me . - Walter ! - Better go . - It 's for you . Mr. Vincent ! George Vincent ! Quit banging on the damn door ! I 'm a federal agent , Mr. Vincent . I 'm asking you to open the door . You ask away . Then go away . Mr. Vincent , your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your apartment . You may be in danger if you refuse to quit harassing me . Now , I 'm armed in here and I 'm within my rights . Well , that 's great . But you may not be armed for what it is I 'm talking about . What the hell are you talking about ? Hmm ? It don 't matter . I 'm armed against it . The Junta , Cuba and Castro . I 'm not going to cede my home to no revolutionaries without a fight . You got anything else you want to throw at me- - you bring it on . All the nuts roll down to Florida . He 's had some kind of foreign organism released into his body . His condition 's worsening . I can see that . What the hell was chewing on his neck ? I don 't know . It may have been some kind of a water-borne parasite . Uh huh . You see that ? You see what happens when you live in a dump ? Where 's Harry ? - I 'm sorry . I don 't know who Harry is . - The slumlord who owns this place . - He may have evacuated . - Harry ? Right . And I 'm giving birth to the Christ child . Harry 's legs hardly work . He 's got to use those crutches . He don 't have no car . Nobody likes him 'cause he never lifts a finger on this rat trap . - Scully , can I talk to you for a second ? - Yeah . - Now , who are you ? - Nobody . Nobody ? Oh , well , it is so nice to be surrounded by so many great men . - We got to get out of here as soon as possible . - We can 't . We can put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital . Mulder , I just got off the radio . They won 't even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time . The roads are impassable , and I don 't even know if the deputy is movable in this condition . - You mean we 're stuck here ? - It looks that way . At least until the weather breaks . Federal agents ; jack-booted fascists bent on trampling the rights of the common man . Don 't need their damn help defending my home . Violence in the pursuit of freedom is no vice . Because all that 's needed for tyranny to prevail is for good men to do nothing . I don 't think these wounds are bites or stings . There 's something in here , Mulder , right under the skin . Tongs . Mulder , what 's his temperature ? Well , either he 's got no temperature or he 's about to spontaneously combust . You 're not far off . It 's 106 . Okay , somebody fill the tub with cold water and find as much ice as they can in the freezer . B-but that thing is in the ... plumbing . Yeah , well , it may be but unless we get his temperature down he 's not going to survive this . Now get moving . I need a container . Mulder , lift him up . We have to get him into the tub . Mr. Vincent ? Drop your weapon ! Put it down ! It 's gonna take a whole lot more than this to kill whatever it is I just saw . I don 't know what the hell it was but it came down out of there . You didn 't see it ? I caught it out of the corner of my eye but it swooped down at me . I ... - All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst . - No , no , this thing came at me . That looks like the four-inch tie-in to the second floor . Whatever it is didn 't just rip through the ceiling . - Looks like it ripped right through the pipe . - Where did it go ? I don 't know . It must still be in the building . It 's probably in the outflow system . Well , maybe it 'll just flow back out . Or maybe it 'll come up through the can and grab you by the nugs . - Someone 's already got him by the nugs . - Look , you guys , whatever this thing is there 's no evidence yet that it 's going to kill anybody . - Well , what about the man in the bathtub ? - The man in the bathtub may very well be saved if he can just last out this storm . In fact , we may all be safe if we just remain calm . " Remain calm ? " I got to pee so bad my back teeth are swimming . Victory . How is he ? H-he 's good . - Supertanker coming through . - Here , Angela , you can 't go in there . My bladder is pressing against your unborn child , Walter . He 's going to have a head like a tortilla . This thing is in the plumbing ! The volume alone could push it right back out to sea . Scully , that 's how this thing is here . The hurricane is sitting offshore dredging up God knows what and this thing must have been driven into the city 's reclamation system through some offshore outfall pipe . From there it gained access to the sewer pipes in this building . - We 'll be waiting for you out here . - Thank you . Mulder , nothing I 've seen convinces me there 's a monster ... I know you probably can 't hear me but no listening anyway , okay ? Scully , something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the ocean , something that had been lying there undiscovered for ages , probably . Mulder , there is no evidence of any creature here . Those organisms might just simply be waterborne parasites , but something from Jules Verne they are not . I saw it ! I saw it ! It 's in the tub with the deputy . It has giant arms like an octopus . Mulder ? What the hell is it ? He 's gone . - It 's gone ? - No . He 's gone . The deputy . Where 'd he go ? I think the deputy went out with the bathwater . - And he was ... he was in there with it ? - No , I don 't think he was . Well , she said she saw it . I 'm sure she did . Look , Scully , I think I know why nobody 's ever seen this thing before . It , it just doesn 't live in water . It is water , taking shape only when it attacks , like it did when the hurricane backed seawater into the plumbing . Virtually unseeable until then . Mulder , if that were true then this wouldn 't be visible , would it ? I mean , what this is showing us is that water actually attempts to kill it . Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process . Maybe it needs time to complete its cycle like it had with the Shipleys . - Mulder , the Shipleys weren 't even in their house . - No , they were when they were attacked just like the deputy was here . Using their bodies to lay its own spawn , using the body 's water content to reproduce itself , to make itself anew . - You mean , he turned into one of those things ? - There are more of them ? - We got to get out of here . - We 're in the middle of a hurricane . - We got to get to another building . Mulder , we can 't . There 's no way we can transport everybody . We can use the deputy 's Prowler . How many people ? We got two , four ... Son of a bitch . The looter ? Mulder ? Yeah ? Mulder , if we 're going to leave we should leave now . Mulder ? ! Hey , Mulder , are you okay ? Hey ... wait a second . What are you doing ? ! - I am saving our lives . - That 's my partner out there ! - If he 's your partner he should have listened to you . - You can 't just leave him there ! - I 'm not letting him in . - He 's gonna die ! - What are you going to do for him ? - Well , I can at least keep him breathing ! You couldn 't save the deputy . Look , at least let me try . I 'm a medical doctor . That 's good ... because my water just broke . - You 're going to be okay . - Yeah , that 's easy for you to say . Isn 't much of a choice , really , is it ? We 're gonna need water . If I 'm gonna deliver this baby you can put that gun down . - How do we know you 're really a doctor ? - You don 't . The truth is I 've never delivered a baby before . So stand back or make yourself useful but stay out of my way . - Long , even breath ! - You got it . Breathe ... Breathe . Okay , Angela , I 'm going to need you to push , okay ? I need you to help me help you . Okay . So let 's push . You got it . You got it . You 're on the right track . I 'm going to need some towels , please . I need some towels , damn it ! You 're doing good . You 're doing good . Okay . You 're doing good . Okay . Let 's go . Okay , push . - I can feel it up there ! - She can feel it up there ! Okay , come on . Puuush ! Good ! You got it . Okay . - Here it comes . - Here it comes . Here it comes . It 's coming . Okay . Hey , lady , what are you doing ? - It 's the water . - What ? What ? - It 's the water ! - I 'm having it ! - I 'm having it ! I 'm having it ! - Okay ! - I 'm having it ! - Push ! I 'm having it ! It 's coming ! Push ! Push ! - Okay ! - Help ! - Okay , now pick up the gun . - Help ! Aah ! Pick up the gun ! Shoot out the sprinklers ! Just point and shoot ! Shoot out the sprinklers ! My name is Dana Scully ... Yeah ... thank you . Yes , yes . Eww , God . That 's terrible . Well , it 's official . Ten pounds , ten ounces of piss and vinegar . El niño grande , Leroy Walter Villareal Suarez , Jr . - Oh , no . - Oh , yes . - Oh , it 's amazing . It 's truly amazing . - What 's that ? That you could come here in the face of a hurricane chasing a sea monster , yet , and end up bringing a new ... life into the world . And then slaying the monster and save this one 's life as he was quite literally circling down the drain . She didn 't save my life , really ... Oh , yes , she did . Oh yes , yes , with a gun to her head , no less . Well , you wouldn 't have known to go out in the rain if I hadn 't pointed it out that to you that it was the fresh water that killed the organism ... - No . No no no no ... I-I saw the Shipley 's cat . - Uh , well , I-I can 't swallow that ... No , no , no . I saw the cat , which had been saved which had been in the washing machine . And the Shipleys had boarded up their house which means that the only way that they could have vanished was if the creature came up through the plumbing in a backwash of seawater ... seawater . And then the deputy who vanished from a bathtub full of Epsom salts . If Agent Scully had not been there with you I shudder to think what would have happened to you . I 'd say you owe her your life . It takes a big man to admit this , but ... If I had had someone as savvy as her by my side all those years ago in the X-Files ... I might not have retired . I suggest that we have a toast to your good fortune . And I insist that we have it . So ... what 'll it be ? A little of the ... Oh , uh ... - Anyone for water ? - No !

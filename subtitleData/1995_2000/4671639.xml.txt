Mrs. Streck , Mrs. Armacost . - First , your husbands are alive . - Oh , thank God . They 're back on the orbiter and we 're gonna bring them down immediately . What happened up there ? Your husbands were outside the orbiter performing some repairs on a satellite . There was an explosion and we lost contact with both astronauts for about two minutes . - You lost contact ? - What ? - What do you mean , lost contact ? - After the explosion they drifted behind the shuttle . We had to bring the craft around 180 degrees to get them . - They were all alone ? - But now , they 're back on the shuttle and they 'll be back down here as soon as we can manage it . Uh , Mr. Reese here will stay with you until we can get you to them . They were all alone out there , Jillian . It 's okay . They 're alive . This will give you a view from the shuttle as they land . Would you like me to get you the linkup ? I 'll get the linkup . [ BEEPS ] MAN 1 : Twenty-five seconds to re-entry interface . MAN 2 : Flight controllers will be closely watching ...

JILLIAN : What did you say ? Well , I told that bloated fast-food-eating motherfucker we 'd never have gotten to be heroes if he hadn 't cut our budget and forced us to put that piece of shit exploding satellite up in orbit . - Really ? - Yeah . And then what happened ? Aw , he said he 'd never been talked to like that before by anybody . I said I didn 't give a rat 's ass and if he ever called me again I would track him down roust him out of his bunk , pull his pants around his ankles and spank him with a hanger in front of his wife and children . - Well , that 's real subtle . - Yeah , I thought it would be subtle . Wanna tell me what you really said to the President ? Yeah . - I thanked him for his call . - Mm-hm . Then I asked him what he was wearing and he started breathing kind of heavy , made a funny noise and hung up . - What do you think that means ? - Maybe he 's not into you . SPENCER : I guess not . Now , she got balloons . - Why didn 't I get balloons ? - You got candy . SPENCER : I didn 't get no candy . - You got candy . SPENCER : Where 's my candy ? - In the car .

They 're back . He doesn 't talk about it , does he ? Neither does Alex . Never mentions it , not a word . Well , do you blame them ? Those two minutes , they almost died , Jillian . - But they didn 't . - But they almost did . To go through that together , to come back and never talk about it , never bring it up it 's bizarre . Natalie , it 's over . Honey I know this has to be hard for you too . It just scares me that they act like it never happened . [ AIRCRAFT ENGINE DRONING ] - There you go . - Thanks , commander . - You got it , buddy . BOY : Hey , Mike , what did he write ? - Hey . - Hm ? - Guess what . - What ?

Now , the President of the United States said that and you heard it . Yeah . Anyway ... it 's pretty good for business to have a true American hero on the company letterhead , you know . The thing of it is , Jill is that the company headquarters it 's in New York City . - You 're kidding , right ? - No . - New York ? - Yeah . - You hate New York . - Yeah . - Too many people , remember ? - I know . We have a life here , Spencer . - My job , our friends , everything . - Yeah . So , what do you say ? Will you do it ? Will you move to New York City with me ? [ CHATTERING ] Hm ?

He will be missed terribly by all of us . There will be a private ceremony . [ REPORTERS CHATTERING ] - Is Commander Armacost in any danger ? - Uh , I 'll let Dr. Patraba answer that .

But the modern battlefield is all electronic and the fighter that this man helped us design can detect sort , identify and eliminate anything electronic . You got two McLaren engines pumping 25,000 pounds of thrust wingspan of 75 feet . - Fully extended . SPENCER : Yeah , that 's fully extended . You got a top speed of 1800 miles per hour a ceiling of 55,000 feet and a crew of two . The modern battlefield is a blizzard , a transparent , electronic blizzard with planes and tanks and computers and missiles all humming away and into that storm flies our fighter . It doesn 't drop bombs . It doesn 't shoot missiles . It just sends out a signal . It 's like the voice of God . It 's just a signal that turns everything off . SHELLY : I forget , Jackson . Who is the enemy now that we need your plane to defend us from ? The enemy at this moment ? - You are , dear . You are . SPENCER : Ha , ha . The signal it makes , what does it sound like ?

Noticed any change in your husband 's behavior since the shuttle mission ? I 've been through these files and there are some peculiarities . Like right here . Your husband 's signature before the shuttle . Here 's a form signed when he returned . Now , they are similar but not the same . Not the same signature . Mr. Reese , are you in New York on official NASA business ? And here 's the results of the medical tests ... - ... we ran when he got back . - Mr. Reese . - Are you on official NASA business ? - Everything is fine . Everything shows up normal but everything 's a bit different . Uh , blood levels , temperature , EKG , EEG .

Um , they terminated my employment . - I have to go now . - No . If you have anything to say , you can call my husband at McLaren . I showed them facts . They terminated my employment . They referred me to a psychiatrist . Don 't follow me . I 've seen Streck 's autopsy report . It was a stroke . His system overloaded . His body couldn 't stand the strain . I 've seen Natalie Streck 's autopsy report as well . That was a suicide . - She killed herself . I was there . I saw it . - Yeah , she did . According to the report , when she killed herself she was three weeks pregnant . What did you say ? She conceived right after her husband left the hospital . She was pregnant , Mrs. Armacost . So , what happened during those two minutes when they were alone , what happened ? The suits your husband and Streck wore had built-in recorders . Something happened out there that scared the shit out of them . - What could do that ? - No . It was an accident , an explosion . - The satellite- - - They train for explosions . They train for accidents . They trained for hours . They have a plan . They don 't panic . They don 't deviate . Stick to the plan . That 's what they do . Something happened out there that these two men had not trained for . What would do that to two highly trained astronauts ? Scare them like that ? Can you swear to me that he 's still your husband ? Can you ? - Let go of me , Mr. Reese . - Ma 'am , is this man bothering you ? Yes . Yes , he is . You know , don 't you ? You already know . - Okay . - Room 304 Nesbit Arms , Mrs. Armacost .

The enemy prince after overrunning the castle finds the princess and forces himself upon her . Months later , the princess is with child . But whose ? It 's either the child of her enemy the man that killed her husband the man that raped her in which case , she 'll kill herself and the child or it 's the child of her prince . The only thing she has left of him . A part of him still alive within her kept safe inside her in which case ... But how would she know until it was too late ?

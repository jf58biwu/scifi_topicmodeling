 - Previously on The Pretender . - Mama ! - They 're trying to hurt her ! - Mama , no ! - [ Gunshot ] - Bring Jarod back . - My father wants me to do it . - I 'm not afraid of your father . I have reason to believe my mother may have rescued these children . [ Fly Buzzing ] You know , Gator Heaven has the finest gator wrestling ... in all of South Florida . In fact , we produce more wrestling champions than any other roadside attraction . - That 's Jarod ? - Can you believe he mastered gator wrestling in a week ? - A regular Tarzan . - Gave ' em all nicknames too . Called the one with the sharpest teeth Miss Parker . Been gone about a month . Did he leave anything behind ? Like a red notebook ? He left somethin ' better . - Said this was for you . - Beautiful . Genuine native art . Handcrafted by the tribe . In Taiwan ? Eastern tribe . Lovely , Jarod . Another game . Said if you wanted it , you had to sign for it . Thank you . No . Jarod said the pen was for you too . [ Sighs ] [ Man ] There it is . Now come on , bubba . We gotta relocate this prehistoric handbag ... before the hurricane evac . - Reports got it comin ' in pretty fast too . - It 's still a few hours off . It 's hard to believe a day this beautiful is gonna turn into a storm . Well , if you 're in a hurry , I could wrestle it for you . - What ? The gator ? - Yeah . - You lost your mind , bubba . - I used to wrestle for the Seminoles . - Florida State ? - No . The tribe . - Come here , girl . - Whoa , whoa . Wait a minute . How do you know that 's a she ? I know that smile . [ Man Narrating ] Miss Parker , you 're to come with me . Daddy , the next time that you want to see me ... you don 't have to send the welcome wagon . You 're here at my invitation , not your father 's . You 've been busy . I don 't follow you , sir . I follow you . What was in the safety deposit box ? Nothing , sir . Let me rephrase , Miss Parker . I know it was Mommy 's box . What did you find in it ? [ Wheezing ] I was looking for answers . About what ? About how she died . - Your mother shot herself . - Daddy . Leave us , Mr. Raines . Don 't I get a hug ? [ Laughs ] Been too long . So , how are things at the summer house ? Are the leaves coming back ? Slowly . You know how spring can be up there . Stubborn . Your mother always got impatient . I don 't remember that about her . But I ... I do remember this . You look like her . Watching you ... in some ways she never left . Daddy , I want to know what happened to my mother . - I 'm disappointed in you . - You 're disappointed in me ? Don 't tell me you believe this crap . But I remember that Thanksgiving ! The fight that you had . And a few months later , she was dead . Don 't let your emotions run away with you . I taught you better . Just tell me what happened . I killed her . At least , that 's what I torture myself believing . When someone you love commits suicide ... you search for answers to the mystery you don 't understand . That 's what you 're doing now . I miss her . You were young . There 's no way you could 've known what she was going through . It was a sad time . I don 't know why she left us . Don 't you think I miss her too ? Of course . You can believe your father orJarod . Who 's it going to be ? Daddy , I want a new assignment . Jarod is Sydney 's mess , and Mr. Raines 's . Please put me back in corporate . - We have our arrangement . - I know . You were a quiet , uncertain little girl ... and now you 're this ... presence . It 's time for my treasure to shine ! I know what you 're capable of . Do you ? I do . And our deal stands . [ Miss Parker ] Florida ? I was there yesterday . [ Broots ] I know . You just weren 't south enough . While you were away , Broots and I revisited the old notebook from the Atlanta site ... and we found some clues . Global coordinates written in it that lead us to ... Hurricane Cassandra . Top wind speeds of 150 miles per hour . [ Sydney ] When Jarod was in Atlanta ... Cassandra was just a badly formed tropical depression . He must have predicted its course . Jarod put himself in the path of a hurricane ? Someone from Marine Patrol in Bahia Grande is using the Centre 's access code ... to hack into Defense Department weather satellites . It 's the same one I 'm using . - [ Phone Rings ] - Tech room . Broots . Uh ... [ Clears Throat ] No . Yes , sir . Uh , right here . Hold on . It 's for you . Yes . Of course . Very clear . - Who was that ? - It was personal . - How fast can we get down there ? - Uh , a couple of hours . But they 're already starting to evacuate people from South Florida . Then I 'll go with Sam . Miss Parker , it isn 't safe . lfJarod 's really on that island , I have him right where we want him . - Who was on that call ? - Mr. Raines . [ Helicopter Approaching ] [ TVAnnouncer ] Residents and merchants of Bahia Grande ... are frantically boarding up windows and packing cars this afternoon . Cassandra is expected in four to five hours , around 7 : 00 p.m. this evening . - Islanders are being reminded ... - I 'm gonna be out ... out front . But don 't worry , Simone . We 'll get you to the doctor real soon . Hey ! - Battening down the hatches ? - I 'll tell you what . My cracker butt is gonna sell this place and move to Oklahoma after this one . For what ? Tornadoes ? - Okay . California . - Earthquakes ? Somewhere ' sides here . How 's she doing ? Fever 's not breaking . [ Sighs ] You better hurry up . Jarod , are you sure you should 've pulled Simone out of that facility ? They were going to ship her back to Haiti . I can 't believe Bartlett would do that ... just let her folks die in a storm . People will do all kinds of things for money . I 'll see that he gets paid . Jarod , forget about him . Come go with us . I , uh ... - What is it ? - I 'm just ... I 'm not very good around sick people . I watched my old man have a heart attack . I knew he needed C.P.R. or something , but I froze . I just ... I watched him go . I can 't handle the responsibility . The analgesic I gave her should help with her fever . All you need to do is drive her to Miami . The doctors will take over from there . You can do it . I trust you . [ Sighs ] If you say so . - Jarod . - Hi . - It 's empty . - No more candy . Doctor 's orders . But I 'll get you some more ... as soon as we see your family in Miami . I promise . [ Whispering ] I 'll see you in a bit . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Are you gonna help me with this cage ? I can 't , sir . I just got this download from the State Department of Law Enforcement . They suspect that the parents of the Haitian girl were killed around Harrison Marsh . They want evidence gathered before Cassandra washes it away . Let me see that . Hmm . Uh , why don 't you finish up here , and I 'll take care of this . - I 'll go with you . - No . I can handle it . [ Thunderclap ] - [ Woman ] No . ! - [ Man ] I won 't let you do it . ! [ Woman ] Don 't . ! You 're hurting me . ! [ Man ] Come back here . ! [ Thunder Continues ] - [ Creaking ] - [ Thunderclap ] Faster , Sam . Okay . We 're gonna be leaving here in just a few minutes . Okay ? [ Thunder Continues ] Boo ! Damn it ! You scared the hell out of me . [ Shouts , Grunts ] - I 'm sorry . - Hey . ! Hey , bubba . ! What the hell is this ? Are you gonna stand there or cut me out of this ? Cut you out ? I spent a long time making that thing . You rigged this net ? Think of it as a bag . A trash bag . You cut me out of this now , or I 'll blow you away ! Most criminals , they smuggle drugs or stolen cars . - Do it ! - You trade in human life . You smuggle Haitians , and then you charge their families in Miami . - [ Gun Clicks ] - And once you get them here , you raise the price . Now that 's ransom , pure and simple . And if they can 't afford to pay , well , you just let ' em die in a storm . Kinda like the one that 's coming now . You got no proof of nothin ' ! I sent it to the State Department of Law Enforcement . Simone 's family , theyjust wanted to start a new life . But you took that away from them . And that little girl , she doesn 't have a mom and dad ... because you locked them out here in a shack to die in a storm . As the shack collapsed around them ... her parents threw themselves on their daughter . They died trying to save her life ! Do you know what it 's like to grow up without parents ? Hey , hey ! Bubba , wait , wait ! You can 't leave me out here ! This hurricane 'll kill me ! Oh , no , it won 't . You 're about three miles north of the damage path . At least I think so ... - bubba . - Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Come back here ! You can 't leave me here ! You 're dead ! You 're dead , you son of a ... Jarod ! [ Man On Radio ] This is the Emergency Broadcast System . Hurricane Cassandra is making landfall at this hour along the island 's eastern shore . Winds are at 150 miles per hour . Evacuation of Bahia Grande has been completed . Remaining residents are advised to seek shelter in the center of a safe , secure structure . - I 'm sorry , Jarod . - What happened ? I got good news and bad . Bridge is washed away . Power 's out . Phone lines are down . - We 're gonna have to ride out the storm here . - What 's the good news ? [ Miss Parker ] That is the good news . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Pilot had to evacuate . He lost contact with Miss Parker 20 minutes ago . Thank you for making us South Florida 's choice for news . - Feed 's up . - Our stop story is ... who else ... Cassandra ... whose top winds have now been upgraded to 175 miles an hour . Cassandra has veered 30 degrees north-northeast ... and it looks like Bahia Grande will bear the brunt of Cassandra 's fury . Well , Cassandra hasn 't met Miss Parker . - [ TVContinues , Indistinct ] - I hope they 're all right . [ Cork Pops ] After all those dead ends , all I needed was a little help from Cassandra . To women . Hell hath no fury ... That isn 't good for your ulcer . Neither are you . Don 't underestimate the power of Cassandra . Her winds are probably peaking at 175 miles per hour . - This place 'll hold . - Just in case it doesn 't ... why don 't you tell me who my parents are ? Tell me who I am . Maybe I should send you to every Y.M.C.A. in the country first . Or lock you in the Bates Motel with Sydney and Broots . This is about that strip search in Las Vegas , isn 't it ? Come on . You 've got me . Why don 't you tell me ? You shouldn 't have wasted your time helping the downtrodden . I haven 't wasted my freedom . Jarod , you were wrestling an alligator . - [ Laughing ] - So you got the medical report . I have what you forgot . You didn 't come here just to retrieve me . You want answers . I have everything I need . Daddy 's going to be thrilled . But Daddy doesn 't give you what you want now , does he ? What did Daddy tell you about your mother 's ... suicide ? - That 's enough ! - I bet it wasn 't the truth . Yeah , well , the truth is you 're a liar ! Always have been . You faked that medical report . I wouldn 't fake something like that . I didn 't want to have to tell you ... but I couldn 't withhold a key to your past . [ Thunder Continues ] [ Scoffs ] Nice try . You 're so in control . So ahead of the game , aren 't you ? Well , not anymore . Now I make the rules . [ Thunderclap ] [ Grunting , Muttering ] Hold on . You 're such a good , good girl . How many merit badges did this get you ? You don 't think that rescuing children is a good idea ? Your mother certainly thought it was . [ Thunderclap ] The leading edge just passed . The eye wall should hit in about 17 minutes . - Honey , wake up . - That 's the worst part . - Jarod , I can 't wake her . - Let me take a look at her . - Sam can do it . - Sam is not a doctor . I ... I can be . Please ! [ Thunder Continues ] Simone ? It 's me . Simone . Talk to me . Come on . Simone ? Simone ? If he tries anything , shoot him in the foot . Simone ? Simone , can you hear me ? [ Thunder Continues ] - [ Woman ] No . ! - [ Man ] Listen to me . ! - Stop . ! - I know what you 're doing . ! - You 're hurting me . ! - Where are you going ? Come back here . ! [ Creaking ] She 's dipping in and out of consciousness . I need to get her fever down . The infection is spreading . She needs penicillin . I can get some from the first aid kits at the boathouse . - Across the island ? - After the storm , while you 're on your way to Blue Cove ... I 'll make sure she gets the best specialists . There is no time . She could go into septic shock or a coma . I need to get her the penicillin . The eye should be here in a few minutes . That will give us about 20 minutes of calm . - How can you be so sure ? - Jarod used to be a weatherman in Puerto Rico . Mama , Papa , pouvez-vous me voir ? Simone , tout va bien . Tout va bien . - What 's she saying ? - She 's looking for the sky . Her mother told her before she died that she would look after her from the sky ... that the sun and the moon would be her eyes . I 'm going to the boathouse . Are you going to let her die ? Sam , cuff him . I 'm going with you . Pat , try to keep her temperature under control while I 'm gone . I 'm counting on you . So is she . [ Thunder Continues ] You 're doing the right thing . Call me Mother Teresa from now on . - It doesn 't suit you . - What ? This facade you put up . You try to act like your father , but he 's not who you are . This is business , Jarod , not personal . - No matter how hard you try and make it that way . - It 's personal to me . Then why can 't you leave my mother out of it ? Because she tried to rescue me from your father . - [ Tree Falls ] - [ Tires Skidding ] What now ? It 's less than a mile . If we move fast , we 'll beat the eye . It sure would be a lot easier without these . You try anything , and I 'll put a bullet through your knee . I thought it was my foot . Fever 's not breaking . Come on , kiddo . Work with me . Why are you afterJarod ? Shut up and watch the kid . - I need more ice . - I 'll get it . [ Quiet Muttering ] Jarod , what 's taking so long ? I 've got it . There 's still plenty of time . Simone 's gonna be okay . Honey , I 'm home . [ TVAnnouncer ] Cassandra clocked at speeds up to 160 miles an hour ... - You heard from her ? - [ Continues , Indistinct ] No . I 'm concerned . - So am I. - Oh , you are ? Mr. Raines ordered her into that . Do you have a problem with Raines ? He is out of control . Raines isn 't . Jarod is . Tormenting my daughter with lies about her mother . - Lies ? - You saw her last . You knew her condition . Her only option was suicide . Mrs. Parker , God rest her soul , was manic-depressive . Her marriage was falling apart ... and , of course , there was the question of her beating . Exactly what did she say about that ? I can 't disclose that . But you know psychiatrists , Mr. Parker . We write everything down . So do I. Your wife was my patient . The details of her sessions are privileged . I have privileges , Sydney . I 'm well aware of that . [ Mr. Parker On Speaker ] Anything else , Doctor ? [ Sydney ] No . [ Jarod ] That rope was tougher than I thought . Looks like it cost you a molar . Two . Now shut up ! You never had to clean up one of your messes , have you , Jarod ? You should 've met that cop you framed in Miami . - What a whiner ! - I told you to shut your pie hole ! Listen ... Goober . The Centre will pay you ... Shut up ! Shut up ! I don 't give a damn about the Centre . Soon as this storm is outta my face ... we 're takin ' a little boat ride out to the swamp . But I 'm the only one comin ' back . Tonight you two sleep with the manatees . [ Thunder Continues ] [ Simone Moaning ] Mama , Papa , pouvez-vous me voir ? Hey , hey . Shh , shh , shh . She ... She can 't keep any food down . Let me make her some juice . The vitamins will do her good . [ Thunder Continues ] Hey . ! You scared me . Stop wastin ' time . Your crusade for the little guy is backfiring . How does it feel to face the consequences ? I spent an entire life simulating reality . Consequences ? They feel pretty good . Jarod , what did you mean when you said my mother tried to save you ? She was planning on smuggling me out of the Centre . You were one of the children she tried to rescue ? She died before she could get to me or the others . Others ? She had a list of seven children . The unlucky ones . And where did you get this list ? The medical report wasn 't the only thing in the safety deposit box . The medical report is real . [ Shudders ] I remember my parents fighting that night . She went off the deep end . Wouldn 't even wear her wedding ring . It was a bad time for my father . How can you still trust him ? I never saw him hit her . Ever . - [ Glass Shattering ] - [ Blow Landing ] [ Creaking ] I never saw anyone . Not that I can remember . People repress memories . Especially traumatic ones . Unless something helps bring them out ... like a ... a smell ... or a sound . I used to sell power memory tapes on late-night cable . Perhaps you missed that one . Let me help you . Thanks for the offer , but I can take care of myself . [ Thunder Continues ] [ Loud Groaning ] [ Groaning ] [ Raines ] If you were so worried about her ... you should have gone with her . She only went because you intimidated her . Miss Parker is doing her job . I 'm glad to see someone is . What happened to you ? Too many cigarettes , not enough vacations . When you were Dr. Raines , you were my colleague . I never detected this obsession . I don 't have to follow the Hippocratic oath anymore . My only directive is to bring Jarod back . For that to happen , Miss Parker needs focus . She has a lot of issues on her mind . She 's always been a curious girl . Takes after her mother . Weather Service says the eye just passed the island . We could ... We could ... [ Clears Throat ] We could be there by morning . Get a jet . Come on , Broots . We wouldn 't want any harm to come to Miss Parker . That 's it . A little tangerine , a little key lime . Good for the soul . But you 're still burning up . Come on , Jarod . - Where are you going ? - To get some more . Looking for this ? Okay . Time for a little boat ride . Ladies first . [ Grunts ] [ Groaning ] [ Grunts , Groans ] - [ Chuckles ] - Drop it ! [ Laughing ] That 's a flare gun . It 's gonna redefine heartburn unless you drop it . - [ Groans ] - Where 'd you get that ? I snuck it into the first aid kit when you weren 't looking . [ Panting ] You were gonna use that on me . I still am . Try gumming through this . And you are going to have to dislocate a lot more than your thumb ... to get through that . Why did you save my life ? Because ... I still remember the little girl ... who gave me my first kiss . [ Thunderclap ] [ Thunder Continues ] [ Shutter Banging ] [ Creaking ] - [ Woman Screaming ] - [ Glass Shattering ] [ Man ] I know what you 're doing . ! [ Woman ] Leave me alone . ! [ Creaking ] - Mama . - Mama . It 's okay , sweetheart . Mama 's all right . Mr. Raines . Hey . - Hey ! - What ? Don 't you people keep a spare key to that cage around here ? Yes , we do . It 's in that Miami Heat ashtray on the desk . Trick is getting there . Look , we both want to catch Jarod , right ? Oh , yeah . So you just flip your cage over a few times . You help me catch him , and you won 't just get paid . I 'll make sure that you get a sweet reward . [ Grunting ] Put some muscle into it ! - [ Grunts ] - Yes ! [ Bird Squawking ] Ahh . So , when do I get that sweet reward ? [ Chuckles ] Now . - [ Grunts ] - [ Groans ] Storm 's clear . We 'll be landing in five , Doctor . - Jarod . - Where 's Miss Parker ? I said , where is she ? She had a date . Drop it and stand against the wall ! She needs this . What are you going to do , Sam ? You gonna kill me ? I don 't think you have the authorization to do that . - [ Glass Shattering ] - Whoa ! - [ Laughs ] - Thank you . I should 've done that sooner . - Simone . - Jarod . This 'll hurt just a little bit ... but I promise you ... it 's gonna make you feel a whole lot better . Storm is over ? Yes . It 's over . [ Helicopter Approaching ] Help ! [ Grunts ] He 's a maniac . A maniac ! He tried to teach me a lesson . He thinks he 's some kind of one-man judge and jury ! - Where is he ? - That way . By the front desk . Out . Bungalow 32 . It 's way , way , way to the back . Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . Suckers . [ Helicopter Rotors Whirring ] Ready ? Your mama and papa ... They can see you now . [ Laughing ] I was close , and I learned a few things that are going to get me even closer . The status quo remains ? We have our deal , but it 's not quite status quo . How so ? No more surveillance . No lie detectors . No more games . You second-guess my work again ... I 'll put a bullet in that pet oxygen tank ... and they 'll have to clean you up with tweezers . I catch Jarod my way . And once he 's in the Centre , I 'm gone . That 's the deal . Are we clear ? [ Strained ] As a bell . [ Breathes ] I 'll see you later , Daddy . Good to have you back . [ Miss Parker Reading ] " My dearest daughter , this ring was your great-grandmother 's . " If something should happen to me , I leave it for you . Maybe you 'll have better luck . Mom . ' " [ Phone Ringing ] - What ? - Did you get the ring ? [ Miss Parker On Phone ] Yes . Thank you , Jarod . [ Jarod On Phone ] Did you find your answer ? I think I know who killed my mother , but right now I 'm more concerned with why she died . It was for the children . For you , Jarod . The way I see it , she died trying to save you . - You 're angry . - I won 't stop chasing you . And I won 't chase my past anymore . What if it chases you ? I 'll ignore it . - You make the rules . - That 's just the way I like it . Nice boots . Snakeskin ? Mm-mmm . Gator . [ Mews ]

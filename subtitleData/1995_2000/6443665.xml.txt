 - Name , please ? - Amy Jacobs . OK , Amy . Fill out your address card . And may I have the next one in line ? Carl , I need a reload . Hey , Carl . Hey ! I need more film . I haven 't loaded it yet . Why do you even bother coming in if you 're not gonna do yourjob ? Nobody 's gonna spoil us . Amy ? Amy ! Mom ! Hurry up with those drinks , Lucy . We 're backing ' up . What are you doing ? These are regular . They all ordered large . What ... What happened ? Nobody 's ... gonna spoil us . Nobody 's ... gonna spoil us . Nobody 's gonna spoil ... us . Nobody ... Nobody 's gonna ... Nobody 's gonna spoil us . Nobody 's gonna spoil ... Nobody 's gonna spoil ... Nobody 's ... gonna spoil us . - Where 's the agent in charge ? - You are ? - Special Agent Mulder . - I 'll let him know you 're here . Can we get some shots right here ? Yeah . Go ahead . Mrs Jacobs ? I 'm Fox Mulder . I 'm with the FBI . I 'm sorry about your daughter . It 's her birthday on Tuesday . - We 'll do everything we can to find her . - Who could do such a thing ? Who could take somebody who wasn 't theirs ? - I know you must be feeling ... - I 'm sorry , but how could you really know how I feel ? It 's blood . Amy had a nosebleed . Her little sister said it happened when the kidnapper put his hand over her mouth . We 're running it anyway . - Walt Eubanks , special agent in charge . - Fox Mulder . Any leads on the suspect ? A vague description from the sister , hair and fire bits , but he didn 't leave any prints here or in the flowerbeds out front . - What about the neighbors ? - Nobody saw anything . Not a car , nothing . It was someone who knew her . That much we can figure . He knew where he was going . I 'd bet he didn 't know her well or he wouldn 't have been so bold . Either way , we 're chasing our tails until something or someone turns on this . And this woman at the restaurant ? - You heard about that ? - That 's why I came . - Seems like a pretty thin lead . - Mind if I talk to her ? Hey , save me the time . Great . Thanks . - Mulder . - I thought you missed your flight . We were delayed in DC . I tried your cellphone . I forgot it . I left in a hurry . - Your message said a kidnapping ? - A 15-year-old girl , Amy Jacobs , was taken from her bed last night at ten . - Is she here ? - They haven 't found her . - Then why are we here ? - A 30-year-old , Lucy Householder , was admitted here shortly after ten . She collapsed at work suffering from a seizure and what her doctors call glossolalia . - Incoherent speech . - Technically . But she was repeating the exact words spoken by Amy 's abductor at the exact same time 20 miles across town . - That 's spooky . - That 's my name , isn 't it ? Lucy Householder knows something about kidnapping herself . When she was eight , she was taken from her bed while her parents were asleep . She was missing for five years until she escaped and was found by the side of a road . Apparently her abductor kept her locked in a basement the entire time . They never caught him . Lucy ? I 'm Fox Mulder . This is Dana Scully . We 're with the FBI . We 'd like to ask you a few questions . I 'd like a cigarette . They won 't let me smoke in here . - Are you feeling any better ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'd just like a cigarette . A young girl was kidnapped last night . Have you heard anything about that ? What are you asking me for ? Do you remember what you said last night when you collapsed ? - What ? - You said \ x22Nobody 's gonna spoil us . \ x22 - Does that mean anything to you ? - No . Can you think of any reason why you might have said it ? What did I just say ? You see , those were the exact words spoken by the kidnapper to the girl he took last night . So you can see that it might seem strange that you ... So what 's your point ? All of us kidnap victims gotta stick together ? No . We just wanna find the little girl any way we can , and if you know anything ... Look , what I 've been through all my life I wouldn 't wanna wish on anybody . Doesn 't mean I can make it any better for me or anyone else . - Well , thanks for talking to us , Lucy . - Yeah . Hey ! - When do I get outta here ? - As soon as your doctors feel you can go . No , they say it 's up to you . No . We can 't hold you here . You 're free to go . I guess she 's not too big on confined spaces . Yeah . - Are you the one that called for a tow ? - No , not me . - Gary Mosier ? - No . Wrong guy . - I might as well give you a hand . - That 's OK . We 'll be fine . Looks like you 're in a world of hurt . Blown sidewall . You 'll need a new tire . - Yeah , it looks that way . - Got a spare in the trunk ? - Yeah . - 40 bucks cash . My boss don 't gotta know . Take five minutes . - I can 't pay you . - Make it ten . Take me five minutes max . Leave me alone ! - Hey , man , what the hell 's your problem ? - Leave me alone ! Get outta here ! Lunatic ! Freak ! - Lucy Householder . Get anywhere on that ? - I 'm workin ' on it . She 's got a criminal record . Prostitution , narcotics convictions . She 's done some time . - Doesn 't surprise me , given her history . - Boyfriend 's inside for child endangerment . Used to live with him up in the hills . Sketchy characters . - I don 't think she 's involved . - Closest thing I got to a lead . I can ... No , let me follow up on that . OK ? Thanks . Mulder ! - I 've got something . Something weird . - What ? I was going over Lucy 's medical workup and something hit me . Her blood type is O positive . Yeah ? Forensics lifted two blood types off of her work clothes : O positive and B positive . Guess what Amy 's blood type is . How could it be Amy 's blood ? Lucy was across town . - It begs the question . - Because it matches the victim 's blood type ? How many people have B-positive blood ? One in five ? That 'd be hundreds of thousands of local people alone . We 're talking about a woman who 's tied to this case who had somebody else 's blood on her uniform . Lucy is a victim , just like Amy Jacobs . If she 's got any connection to this case , that 's the extent of it . - Well , we 'll know soon enough . - What are you talkin ' about ? I 'm running a PCR on her blood to see if there 's a DNA match . - Do me a favor . Keep that under your hat . - Why ? Cos I don 't want Lucy treated like a suspect until it 's absolutely certain that she is one . OK ? - Lucy ? - I 'm cold . I brought you another blanket . - We should call the doctor . - No ! Let me see your face . - What did you do to yourself ? - It 's dark . Why is it dark ? - I can 't see . - You hold on now . I can 't see ! - How 's she doin ' ? - Fine . Blood pressure 's back to normal . Temperature 's back up . She must 've gone down the rabbit hole for a while . You should get something to eat soon . Get your blood sugar back up . What do you say , Lucy ? Can I take you to dinner ? - Are you feelin ' better ? - Better than what ? Better than Amy Jacobs . Wouldn 't know . If anybody knows , I say you do . I got my own set of problems now , thank you . - How 'd you scratch your face ? - Must 've done it in my sleep . Are you using again , Lucy ? I 'm clean . Passed my test last week . Ask Henry . With flying ' colors . Ever experienced temporary blindness before ? I 've probably experienced just about everything once or twice . It 's all been pretty temporary . That girl 's in trouble , Lucy . And there 's not a damn thing I can do about it . You understand ? I can 't help you . I think you can , Lucy . - How ? - That 's something you have to tell me . - What can I possibly do ? - Lead us to her . I don 't know where she is . I don 't care . I 'm not interested . That 's too bad , Lucy , because right now I think you 're her best hope . If I 'm her best hope , then that little girl is in a hell of a lot more trouble than you think . Who are you ? What do you want ? Why are you doing this ? I wanna go home ! - Mulder , I 've got .. - Scully , take a look at this . Just come out into the light . - Is that Lucy ? - Yeah . It was taken in 1978 , the week she was found . She 'd been held in the dark so long , her eyes were hypersensitive to the light . Whoever held her captive wasn 't very big on conversation . She 's 13 years old here and can barely string two words together . - It 's amazing she 's gotten anywhere in life . - By most yardsticks , she hasn 't , Mulder . - Look , I think we 've got a break in the case . - What is it ? School pictures were mailed out this week to everyone in Amy 's class except Amy . - Who 's the photographer ? - Larken Scholastic . The photographer 's assistant was fired the day after the shoot . A man named Carl Wade . - What have you got on him ? - DMV 's an old address . But he spent much of the past 15 years institutionalized for a bipolar condition . The only thing current we have is this photo , taken by his employer trying out a camera . - Have you shown this to Amy 's sister ? - They 're doing it now . I 'm gonna take it and show it to Lucy . Lucy ? - Lucy , wait . - No . I 'm done with you . I just wanna ask you a question . - Lucy , wait a second . - Don 't ... touch me . I don 't like to be touched . I 'm sorry . I was doin ' OK until this . You know ? Figures . I just wanna show you a photograph , OK ? You recognize him , don 't you ? Lucy ! Hey ! No ! Lucy ? What 's happening to me ? He 's probably changed a lot over the last 17 years . Did you even know his name ? Carl Wade . He worked as a photographer 's assistant . School pictures , mostly . That 's where he saw Amy Jacobs . - So what do you want from me ? - Tell me what you 're goin ' through . It might feel good to tell somebody . I feel like it 's happening all over again . You can actually feel what she 's going through , can 't you ? - I don 't wanna go through this again . - Lucy , she needs your help . - There 's nothing I can do . - Lucy ... Wait here a second , OK ? - We 're arresting Lucy Householder . - Why ? I think you know why , Agent Mulder . - What the hell is happening ? - Mulder ... The blood on Lucy 's uniform was an exact DNA match . - Lucy was covered in Amy Jacobs ' blood . - She didn 't do it . It 's incontrovertible evidence . Agent Mulder ! - Where is she ? - She was just here . Well , she 's gone now . Please ! I 'm ... I 'm thirsty . You shouldn 't have run . I was taking care of you . I thought you understood that . - Why did you run away ? - Please , mister ! I need some water ! You shouldn 't have run ! Please ... I 'm so thirsty . I want my mom . I don 't wanna die here . Please ... Please , mister . Don 't let me die ! - You 'll drive her away with this . - She was driven away . I 'm tryin ' to find her . Witnesses placed her across town at the exact time of the kidnapping . - I 'm well aware of the facts . - Trust me . She 's not workin ' with Wade . How 'd she get the blood on her ? She may have bled it . She bled Amy Jacobs ' blood ? It may explain why there was so little of it in Amy 's bedroom . Agent Eubanks . Line three . I don 't have time for this nonsense . We 've got a young girl 's life at stake . I hate to say this , Mulder , but I think you just ran out of credibility . - He 's wrong , Scully . - You are protecting her beyond reason . I think she 's connected to Amy Jacobs , just not the way everybody else thinks she is . Did you consider she may be connected to Carl Wade ? Carl Wade ? Why would she be connected with him ? Abused children crave their parents ' love and hostages develop sympathy for their captors . Maybe Lucy developed an emotional dependency . After five years in a dark pit , I 'm sure they had a connection . Just not what you suggest . It makes more sense than the notion that she 's bleeding Amy 's blood . I think Wade 's abduction of Amy triggered some kind of physical response in Lucy . Some kind of empathic transference . That 's how I account for what Lucy 's going through . And for the identical words that corresponded to Amy , and the spontaneous wounds and blood . - Then why did she run , if she 's innocent ? - Because she 's afraid . You don 't see what you 're doing , do you ? You are so close to this , you just don 't see it . - What don 't I see ? - The extreme rationalization that 's going on . Your identification with the victim . Or , in this case , the suspect . You 're becoming an empath yourself . You are so sympathetic to Lucy as a victim , like your sister , that you can 't see her as capable of committing this crime . You don 't think I 've thought of that ? I have . Not everything I do and think goes back to my sister . You of all people should realize that motivations can be more complex than the result of one childhood experience . Agent Mulder ! We 've got a man on the way in who spotted Wade . Yeah , that 's the guy . I offered to fix his flat . I tried to do the guy a favor and he went wacko on me . - He freaked the minute I got outta my truck . - What about the girl ? Was she with him ? I didn 't see anyone else . Guess she could 've been in the trunk . - Can you give us an exact spot ? - Yeah . Right in the middle of nowhere . - Which way was the car headed ? - West . Interstate 12 ... County 15 North ... 903 ... Look at this . Right off the 903 . - Easton ? - That 's where Lucy was found 17 years ago . It 's a small town . Somebody 's bound to know Wade 's face , know where he lives . But we already stick out like a sore thumb . If we canvass , someone 'll phone him . He 's a photographer , right ? - Yeah . - He should have an account here . Amy ? Mulder ? - Yeah . - What 's happening ? Did you find her ? Where are they , Lucy ? Tell us where Wade took Amy . I don 't know . Anything happens to that girl , Lucy , and you 'll be tried as an accomplice . - Were they here when you arrived ? - No . - You haven 't seen or spoken with ' em ? - I said no . Then why are you here ? - I don 't know . - Just showed up for no reason ? That 's what you ask us to believe ? I 've been here before . A long time ago . It was where he kept me . So why are you here now ? Take her outside and place her in custody . No . I 'll take her . - Come on , Lucy . - Agent ... It 's all right . He hasn 't touched her . Not yet . He wants to , but he can 't . That 's why he takes the pictures . What else , Lucy ? Tell me what else . If he can 't have her all to himself , that 's when he 's dangerous . That 's when he 'll start hurting her . - You came to help her . - No . Why else would you come back here if not for Amy ? You 're sharing her pain . - I can 't ! - You 're the survivor . You 're the strong one . Now Amy needs some of your strength . - She 's not gonna make it . - She has to . And you have to help her . She 's cold . She 's cold ... and wet . Lucy , sit down . Sit down . Mulder ! They found Wade 's car north of here . - They 're in the water . - What ? - There 's a river nearby . I think they 're there . - But it 's east . The car was north . Wade lives here . He knows these woods . He could be doubling back . - Did she tell you that ? - No , but I think she 's trying to . Mulder , wait ! Stay with her . And get word to Eubanks that Wade may be heading towards the river . Please ! Stop ! I can 't ! Come on ! They 're comin ' ! I can 't ! Please ! Nobody ... Nobody 's gonna spoil us . No ! Can you sit up ? Can you breathe ? Are you able to breathe ? This is Agent Kreski . I 've got an emergency medical situation . Requesting EMS . Over . Wade ! Federal officer ! Hold it right there ! She 's not breathing . No pulse either . One , two , three , four ... Come on , Amy , breathe ! .. two , three , four , five ... There 's nothing . Mulder , it 's no good . I 'm sorry . Damn it , Amy , come on ! Stop ! You can 't help her . Mulder , it 's no use . Mulder , stop it . Stop it . Mulder , stop ! Mulder ! - She 's breathing . - Have you got her ? Is that her ? Yeah , we got her ! We need an EMS unit here right away with heat and oxygen . They 're close . They 're up at Wade 's place right now , workin ' on Lucy Householder . I 'm cold . I wanna go home . It 's gettin ' dark . We have to get her off the river . She just started coughing ' . Then she couldn 't breathe . By the time the EMS guys got here , she was already gone . - How 's Amy ? - She 's exhausted . But it looks like she 'll be fine . The doctors will keep her for a day or two just to be sure . - How serious were her injuries ? - Wade must have left her alone . There were no injuries . He dragged her through the woods for at least a mile . I know , Mulder . I can 't explain it . She didn 't have a cut on her . Nobody wants to talk about that right now . They 're just relieved to have her back safe . Did they finish up on Lucy ? Yes . They ... they brought in a state pathologist last night . So I stopped by to get the autopsy reports on my way . She drowned , didn 't she ? They found five liters of water in her lungs . She saved Amy 's life . Mulder ... Whatever there was between them , you were part of that connection . Did you think about that ? Lucy may have died for Amy , but without you they never would have found her . I think she died for more than Amy . What do you mean ? I think finally it was ... the only way she could escape . The only way she could forget what happened 17 years ago . Finally the only way she could outrun Carl Wade .

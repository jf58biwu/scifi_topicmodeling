Listen very carefully . It 's here . Sin Agents Mulder and Scully are here . Send them in . - Sir . - Agents , have a seat . I need you to go to Chicago as soon as possible . To perform a threat assessment . - For whom ? - VinylRight . They make siding . Their telemarketing hub in Oak Brook was the focus of an anonymous taped manifesto . One which threatened violence . Several years back , they had an incident in another office . A disgruntled employee with a gun . They feel they can 't be too careful . Why can 't the Chicago field office take care of it ? Because I 'd prefer you did . Because the manifesto contains bizarre overtones ? Claims of a ... paranormal nature ? It speaks of a monster stalking employees . Your insight into such claims should aid in assessing any threat posed by this person . Monsters . I 'm your boy . - Must 've done something to piss him off . - What do you mean ? To get stuck with this jerk-off assignment . Or have I reached that magic point in my career where every time somebody sees the Virgin Mary on a tortilla I get called out of my basement warren to offer my special insight on the matter ? You 're saying " l " a lot . I heard " we " . Nor do I assume that this case is a waste of our time . Not yours , anyway . There 's no reason both of us should go to Chicago . - Mulder ! - I 'm monster boy , right ? This was forwarded to us by a local radio station . Whoever sent it wanted them to play it over and over again , 24 hours a day . They elected not to . Attention , people of Illinois . This is a warning of the utmost urgency . At VinylRight , 12340 Wabash Terrace in Oak Brook , there is a monster An evil one that preys on the people there . But they can 't see it because it hides in the light . I see it . I know where to look . I can 't be the only one . We all must hunt it down and kill it . Because if we don 't.- - it will take us all . - Do you recognise the voice ? - We have 96 employees . I 'm hoping it 's not one of our people . Though I don 't know who else it would be . Your company had a violent incident in its recent history . We have a plant in Kansas City . Back in ' 94 , one of the warehouse guys came in with a gun , threatened everybody . I think it was over a woman . - May I borrow the tape ? - Keep it . I know our home office has to call you guys for insurance reasons , but , un , this is probably just a crank , some guy making a joke ? It 's best to err on the side of caution . Can you hire security ? If you think we need to . I 'm conducting an internal investigation , interviewing employees , seeing if they 're happy . Use your bestjudgement . I 'll be in touch . - Scully . - it 's me . I need you to check on something . - What ? - It 's a phrase . " Hiding in the light . " - It 's on this tape I 'm looking into . - On the case that 's a waste of time ? Yes , and I didn 't say that it wasn 't . " To hide in the light " or " Hiding in the light . " I think it 's in an old case file somewhere that I got hidden away . Which one ? There 's hundreds . I 'm not sure , but I appreciate it . " Hiding in the light . " ( PA ) Nancy Aaronson , come to my ofHce , please . Uh-Oh . NOW I did it . - Nancy ! - Yeah ? ( PA ) Nancy Aaronson , come to my ofHce , please . What , Gary ? Don 't ! Don 't what ? Gary , I love you , buddy . But you 're really , really weird . ( Nancy screams ) Dial and smile , Gary . ( PA ) Mark Backus , come to my ofHce , please . ( PA ) Mark Backus , come to my ofHce , please . See ? Nothin ' to it . He just wants to say hi to everybody . He 's going alphabetically . Hey , Gary ! Gary Lambert ! _ .Wabash Terrace in Oak Brook , there is a monster An evil one that preys on the people there . But they can 't see it because it hides in the light . I see it .

Because if we don 't.- - it will take us all . ( phone rings ) Mulder . " Hiding in the light . " That was a phrase spoken by one Jerrold Resnick to a Lakeland , Florida police investigator on August 9th , 1992 . - What was he describing ? - Mr Resnick was a deacon of his church . Apparently he was concerned that there was an evil presence amongst his fellow parishioners , and that he alone was aware of that . - He was trying to warn them ? - Not as such . He showed up for Mass one Sunday with four handguns . He began wounding people saying the afflicted ones wouldn 't bleed . He committed suicide a week later in his cell . At the risk of you telling me " I told you so " , I think it 's time for you to get down here . I told you so . Hello ? Hello ? ( mouthing ) Who are you ? - Who 's the agent in charge ? - Agent Rice . Tall guy in the suit . I 'm Mulder 's partner . What can you tell me ? Not much . TV news got the call . That man 's voice told them to broadcast a " stunning revelation " _ Since then we keep ringing , but nobody answers . - Who 's inside ? - We can 't be sure of the total . It happened over lunch hour , so it could 've been worse . The lot 's got 18 cars . One of them 's registered to Agent Mulder . We 're about to try him on his cellphone . Not until we get a clear idea of the situation . There 's a cafeteria . We think he 's got everyone there . He couldn 't have picked a better spot : one door , no windows . We won 't get a clear idea of the situation unless someone talks . If you make a phone call right now , it could compromise Agent Mulder . Sir , we need to find another way . ( wailing ) IVlove ! Now , get down . Down . Everybody stop crying ! Just shut up ! Everybody needs to be afraid of him ! He 's the one that 's out to get you . I 'm protecting you ! - Gary , what are you talking about ? - Shut up ! I 'm not addressing you . I 'm addressing the actual people over here , OK ? ! I 'm not talking to you , or you , or you ! Why should we be afraid of IVIr Pincus , Gary ? I 'd really like to hear what you have to say . - Who are you , anyway ? - My name is Mulder . You said that already . What are you doing here ? - Applying for a job . - Oh , man ! - Did you come to the wrong place ! - I get that . - Why should we be afraid of Mr Pincus ? - Because he 's a monster . Only you can 't see that ... because he 's clouded all your minds . But he means to take us all . One by one . Harvest our souls . Make us into his zombies . Robots made out of meat . Good God almighty ! Gary , I wanna believe that you 're protecting us , but , uh , I 'm kind of afraid of that rifle . It makes it hard for us actual people to concentrate on what you 're saying . Why are you talking to me like I 'm a three-year-old ? Don 't act like you understand what I 'm talking about , because you don 't _ But you will . Shh ! Everybody hold their breath . ( soft rattling ) You sons of bitches . Gary , what are you doing ? Gary ! ( police radio ) Shots Hred . I say again , shots Hred . - Hold your fire ! What 's goin ' on ? - He made us . He 's shooting the ceiling . We gotta find out what the hell 's goin ' on . I 'm calling your partner . No ! If it was safe , he would have called us . Agent Scully , we don 't have a lot of options here . ( gun Ere ) ( screaming ) ( phone rings ) - It 's just my cellphone . Let me get it . - Put your hands behind your head . ( phone rings ) ( phone continues ringing ) FBI ? You happy now ? Huh ? You wanna mess with me some more ? ( Rice ) Hello ? Hello ? ls anybody on the line ? - We heard gum7re _ ls everyone all right ? - I just shot a zombie . - Everybody thinks I killed him but I didn 't ! - Who am I speaking to ? The guy that 's gonna start killing actual people if you don 't put me on the damn TV ! - I think he just shot a hostage . - Who ? He 's still asking for his 15 minutes of fame . Give it to him . Get it outta sight . You wanna know why itjumped at me ? It 's not an " it " , Gary . It 's a " he " . It 's a man you just Killed . - What was his name ? - Mark Backus . Wrong ! It stopped being Mark Backus when he turned it into a zombie . And then he instructed it by means of mental telepathy to attack me . And so I shot it ! I had no choice . But it doesn 't matter because it was already dead . He wants us all like that . Insects , not people . Mindless drones ! He wants to take away who we are . To control us ... so we 'll be his eyes and ears , and spy on each other and help him do his dirty work ! Gary . If I 'm the monster ... what do you need these people for ? Why don 't you just let ' em all go ? You just wait till I put you on TV . Then they 'll see what you are . ( phone rings ) Answer the phone , Gary . - Dial and smile . - OK . We 're sending you the cameraman . - Just stay calm . - Finally . Let 's do it . That is exactly what we 're hearing . All you people put your butts against the door . Hurry up . Go ! You , get over by the counter . Move it ! You see who 's getting hurt if you bust down this door ? So far there 's been very little communication between the police and the people inside ... - Is he getting this ? - Closed-circuit 's bouncing it right back . - He thinks he 's gonna be a star . - All right , show us the room . - What are you doing ? - My battely cable 's twisted . Well , untwist it ! And hurry the hell up ! There . Right there . The exterior wall 's clear . Entry team into position . ( man ) All right , men . Move in ! Move in ! Lie down on the floor : Do it ! All right , put me on . - OK , we 're gonna cut inside . - _ .building. Yes , here it is . Here we go . ( clears throat ) People of America , a monster walks among you . Go . Pan over . Get up . - Now I 'll show it to you . - No , Gary ! - Get out of the way . - Don 't do this . - Get out of the way ! - Don 't do this , Gary . - Get outta the way ! - Put down the rifle . Get outta the way now ! ( fluttering noise ) There ! Look at it ! Look at it ! See it ? ( vehicle approaches ) ( shots Hred ) Let 's see your hands ! Clear ! Now you know . Bag and tag him . - You look exhausted . - No , I 'm fine . Agent Rice has the situation in hand . Let 's get you outta here . Mulder ? I can 't begin to thank you . I owe you my life . We all do . Do you have any idea why he fixated on you the way he did ? No . None at all . I feel like I barely even knew the man . I mean , I try to be a good guy to work for . You mentioned another incident with another employee at a plant in Kansas City in 1994 . - Yes . - Were you at that plant at that time ? Well , lwasn 't there when it happened , but yeah . Didn 't I mention that ? What about Lakeland , Florida ? Have you ever lived there ? I 've been there . I have relatives there . Is there anything else ? No , Mr Pincus . Thank you very much for your patience . What 's going on ? I don 't know . - Mulder , why didn 't you take the day off ? - Close the door . There was a reason " hiding in the light " seemed so familiar . I found it , or variations of it , in five other X-Files . " Hiding in plain view " , " hiding in the open " , " lurking in the open " , all to describe some sort of manifestation of evil which goes unnoticed by everyone except the claimant in each case . - Have you slept ? - Seven cities in all , dating back ten years . VinylRight has offices within fifty miles of four of those . Greg Pincus has worked for VinylRight for guess for how long ? Ten years . And what exactly is it you think you have here ? - What if Gary Lambert was right ? - Mulder , you 're not serious ? Bear with me . What if such a creature existed that camouflaged itself by clouding the minds of its victims ? There are antecedents in the insect world . Mantids are said to hypnotise their prey . No . What if it could induce a visual hallucination , a sort of temporary conversion disorder ? Well , what you 're describing would be more like some kind of a visual agnosia _ An inability to recognise what 's before one 's eyes . Only Gary could see through it . As could the others . Maybe because of a heightened adrenaline level or just because be knew where to look . He was disturbed . But did he see it because he was disturbed , or was he disturbed because he saw it ? He was mentally ill . This monster was a sick fantasy , a product of his dementia . I saw it too . Does that make me disturbed ? Demented ? Does ... that make me sick too ? No . No , I mean , this kind of thing is not uncommon . You ... You went through a terrible ordeal , and sometimes people in close associations , under tense conditions ... The delusions of one can be passed on to the other . Folie é deux ? It 's not that , Scully . It 's not Helsinki syndrome either . What I saw was real and there may be a way to prove it . How ? Lambert pointed out certain individuals be said had been turned into zombies . The man he shot was one of ' em . If you could autopsy the body ... No . Absolutely not . If this is all in my mind , as you say it is , I would be very grateful if you 'd prove that . Mulder , I am not gonna serve the delusions of Gary Lambert , a madman , by giving credence to them . Then I 'll prove it without you . Mulder . - ( Rice ) So , what are we looking for ? - ( Mulder ) I 'll Know it when I see it . - What 's this about ? - He was tracking his boss 's movements . - Stalking him . - Gathering evidence . What is it ? - Did you see where she went ? - Who ? You mind tellin ' me what 's goin ' on ? ( car starts ) Sir ? You wanted to see me ? I was hoping you could give me some insight into Agent Mulder 's recent behaviour . Sir ? Why 's he back in Illinois ? I thought that case was closed . He believes there 's a connection between the Oak Brook incident and several other cases . But you elected not to join him . The Chicago field office spoke to him . They describe his behaviour as erratic . To the best of my knowledge , Agent Mulder is working on a legitimate investigation . - I will join him in Illinois immediately . - Don 't you have an autopsy to do first ? This body Mulder sent to Quantico . Mark Backus , the shooting victim . You 're scheduled to do an examination . - Or didn 't you know that ? - I 'll get right on it , sir . Is there somethin you want to tell me , Scully ? No , sir . Let 's start with the photos . In fact , let 's just do photos . External exam only . He came an awful long way just to have his picture taken . Knock yourself out . Case number 986522 . Mark Backus . 45-year-old Caucasian male . There are three one-centimetre gunshot entry wounds on the left anterior chest wall , with some burn stippling present . Come on , Mulder . From the resolved rigor , fixed Iividity and the decompositional bloating , I 'd place the time of death between 48 and 72 hours . No . This man died late yesterday afternoon . - Are you sure ? - Absolutely . Well , it sure looks to me like he 's been dead longer than that . ( music on TV ) ( woman screams ) ( TV ) I want to do that too ! ( TV ) All right . Are you ready ? Come on , then . ( scampering ) Suddenly I became aware of this ... presence . And I could feel it creeping toward me . It was terrifying . And the next thing I knew , this madman 's inside my house . He breaks my window , kicks in the door , and he 's screaming about monsters . I mean , even worse than Gary . Miss Starns , I apologise for this incident . I assure you it will receive my utmost attention . - Why don 't you take the rest of the week ? - Thank you , Mr Pincus . That man has no business carrying a gun if you ask me . - You got to her too , didn 't you ? - Agent Mulder . I was too late . You changed her somehow . You infected her ! Agent Mulder , think very carefully about the next words that come out of your mouth . Once again , I apologise . There 's no need . I 'm well aware of the stress Agent Mulder 's been under and I 'm , un ... Well , I still consider him a hero . Which is why I wanna handle this privately . We appreciate that . For my part , I 'm happy to let this entire matter drop . I 'm sure I can persuade Miss Starns to do the same . Provided Agent Mulder is amenable . You don 't see what 's going on here . - I 'm afraid I do . - Lambert knew your secret . He knew you were sucking the humanity out of people , feeding on them ! Agent Mulder , that 's enough ! I don 't wanna hear another word . If you care about your career , you 'll knock this off ! I will not stand for another second of this abuse ! Do you understand me ... ? ( Skinner 's voice fades away ) - Get outta the way ! - Stop ! - Look at it ! Look at it ! - Listen to me . Throw it away ! Stop it . Five years together , Scully . You must have seen this coming . Did you examine Backus 's body ? What did you find ? More or less what we thought we 'd find . More or less ? What is that supposed to mean ? The body showed signs of decomposition beyond what we expected to find . Which , in and of itself , means nothing , really . Time of death is notoriously hard to quantify . Or Lambert was telling the truth and that man was dead before he was gunned down . - No . Mulder ... - Scully , when that monster ... Pincus , whatever you wanna call it , when he attacked that woman last night , he did something to the back of her neck - he bit her or he injected something . There 's gotta be evidence of that . Mulder , the case is over . There 's no more evidence to be gathered . There 's only my hope that you 'll be able to see past this delusion . You ... have to be willing to see . I wish it were that simple . Scully , you have to believe me . Nobody else on this whole damn planet does or ever will . You 're my one in ... five billion . Well , you just made it . I was about to ship him . - Full autopsy this time ? - No . Let 's flip him . - Flip him over ? - Yep . Give me a hand . We can do without these . What do you say ? Sorry . There we go . Sleep tight . Don 't let the bedbugs bite . ( fluttering noise ) Nurse ! Nurse ! Nurse ! It 's here ! Nurse ! It 's here ! - it 's here ! It 's at the window ! - What 's here ? There is something ... there is something at the window , and it 's tryin ' to get in here . - Please unstrap me so that I can stop it . - Sir , we 're three floors up . - There 's nothing at the window . - Just undo my straps so that I can check . - I can show you ... - No , don 't ! No ! Just please ... please ... See ? Nothing 's gonna get you . OK . Just , uh ... just untie me anyway , please . - What are you doing ? - You just need some fresh air . I can 't be running in here all night , OK ? ( fluttering noise ) Help ! Somebody help ! I 'm very sorry , but it is after hours and Mr Mulder is resting . You 'll have to come back in the morning . I 've come a long way and I know he wants to see me , so what do you say ? I 'm sorry . Really . It 's hospital policy . ( Mulder ) Help ! Help ! Help ! Agent Scully , I have to say I 'm at a bit of a loss here . Do I infer correctly from this that you believe there 's some merit to Agent Mulder 's claims ? I believe that Agent Mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty . Aside from that belief , I can only present the few hard facts I 've been able to gather . That , as per Agent Mulder 's assertions , a toxin has been found to have been injected into the spine of the shooting victim , Mark Backus . As of yet , we 've been unable to identify it . Furthermore , Gregory Pincus has apparently disappeared without a trace , along with half a dozen other key witnesses integral to this investigation . Among them , Agent Mulder 's nurse at the hospital and several VinylRight employees . IVIen and women described by Mulder as zombies . I personally can vouch for the fact that there was an intruder in Agent Mulder 's hospital room . Describe this intruder . - It was dark . - You got a glimpse . What did you see ? What did you tell him ? The truth . As well as I understand it . Which is ? Folie é deux . A madness shared by two . Mr Jayoox ? Can I take a few moments to tell you about the advantages of WeatherRight replacement windows ? They keep down high heating and cooling costs . They beautify ... They beautify and add value to your home ... ( fluttering noise ) Mr Jaycox ? It 's here ! Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi

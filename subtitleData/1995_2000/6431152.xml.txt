 'All the warnings were true , 'all the predictions fulfilled . 'Chaos ruled . 'But that was not the worst . 'Once the honourable banner of a school of martial arts ... ' .. the flag of the Southern Cross 'is now the fearful symbol of a new order . 'The sign of the North Star , symbol of the last opposing school , 'is freedom 's only hope . ' 'Oh , Kenshiro , my son . 'l know your anguish . 'l feel your conflict . 'How can you wander in the wasteland 'while the world awaits for you to fight the oppressor ? 'How can you deny your destiny ? ' 'l remember the death of my body . ' Shin ? Shin , don 't insult me . At least let me see your face . is my mission as clear to you as my identity , old man ? Yes . Crystal clear . And inevitable . You mean to kill me . Yes. I mean to kill you . My work is done , Shin. I am ready to die . But I am Fist of the North Star . And you are Master of Southern Cross . I am THE Master of Southern Cross . Yes . And the teachings say North Star and Southern Cross must never fight . This is not a fight . It 's an execution . 'Within a year , the city of Southern Cross 'is the most powerful force in the new world . 'This new order is enforced by a harsh militia , 'the Crossmen . ' 'High in his throne room , Lord Shin gazes past the city 'to his dreams of empire . ' Hey , easy on the gas ! Feel the wheels . Come on ! I 'm trying ! 50 miles and we get stuck in our own back yard . Let 's go ! Come on , baby ! Yeah !

I almost hurt myself ! Uh ! Bat ! Bat ! Bat ! Bat ! Bye-bye ! The cross survive ! - Uh ! - My baby ! No ! Let 's run ! Bat ! Bat ! I fought him off. I 'm invincible . Bad rain . Bad rain , Bat ! The rain 's come ! Hurry ! Come on ! Where 's the cover ? Cover the water ! Cover the water ! Cover the water ! Bad rain ! Bad rain ! - Cover the water ! - Let 's go ! Cover the water ! 'The wasteland , an endless expanse 'of baked earth and freezing winds . 'The tomb of civilisation . 'Dwellings are rare . 'Travellers rarer still . ' I need shelter . 'This is Radio Southern Cross . 'The liberation of the wasteland has begun . - ' The recreation ... ' - The broadcast is from the south . 'The flag of the Southern Cross will wave over a new order . ' - l know . - ' We shall construct a new world . ' Aghh ! Urrh ! Julia ! - Kenshiro ! - Aghh ! Leave me alone ! Take your hands off me ! - You people alone out here ? - What do you want ? We don 't want . We take . Let her go . We 'll give you anything . Give ? You don 't give ! We take ! What are you gonna do now , huh ? - We want your wife ! - Stop it , please ! Bring her in . Put her on the bed . - Put her in there ! - No ! You boys are first ! - lt 's like Christmas time ! - Party time now . Yeah ! - Cry all you want ! - Let 's go , baby ! Aggh ! Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo . Oo-oo-oo-oo . Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo ... yaah ! Are you trying to tickle me to death ? Don 't turn your back on me ! You 're already dead . Oh , no ! No ! Aghh ! Aghh , no ! Savour it. lt is food too fine for angels . Yet come . Take . Eat thy fill . You must eat , my friend . You deserve it . My kindred . My brother . Your secret soul was unveiled to me in a vision . Nanto Seiken . The Master of the Southern Cross . Holy Fist . That was a very , very long time ago , Lord Shin . In the past . I am no longer a threat to you . I do not practise the arts . And I don 't like the sight of blood . Yet it 's in my veins . Well , then , please allow me to leave your city . No . Before the Fall , my brother , there was room for 108 schools . And 108 masters of Southern Cross . I respect ... and love you . But there is no place for you here . Please , Master , I beg of you ... I could 've had you killed at any time . But I honour us both too much . This is the way things are . This is the way things must be . Help me . - Hit me . - No . You don 't have the choice . Again . Again . Again . - Again . - Yah ! Again . You were very good . You gave yourself much honour . Careful . We 're almost home . The Crossmen won 't attack in the rain . Next time , I 'm ready . - Greetings . - What ? Hey ! What are you doing here ? Breathing . If you wanna keep breathing , get out . This is our home . You 're blind ? How ? She saw our parents get killed by the Crossmen . She hasn 't seen since . What are you doing ? Something my father taught me . He can 't go out in the rain ! - The rain 's not hurting him ! - How do you ... - How ... ? What did he ... ? - Wait ! Who are you ? - Kenshiro . - Please ! Stay with us ! Protect us ! The townspeople are feeble . Water 's unprotected . We can move right in . Like pigs in a slaughterhouse . Lot of squealing . No balls . No fight . No contest . Why are you telling me this ? Just take care of it . Your cue to leave . Clock 's ticking . - So , he 's here . - You concerned for me ? - l use my eyes . - Use them here . It 's a blueprint of the future , Julia . - The rebirth of history . - Many will die . The history books will forget my methods and applaud my vision . Civilisation will rise from the ashes and I will give the phoenix its wings . I 'm doing it all for you , Julia . I 'm building the future in your name . You are wasting your time . Your problem , Julia is you can 't see the future . Because you 're trapped in the present . Not the present , Shin . I am trapped in the past . We 've found razor wire ! - And collected bottles for Molotovs . - Good . You have the people ? It 's not easy . Neville 's talking peace . - He 's an idiot . - He 's leader of the council . The statements are not contradictory . Shin doesn 't want peace . Shin wants slaves . Do what you can . Let 's all ... Stop , stop . Let 's do some kicks . Hyah ! Stop ! What are you doing ? You , yes. I want you to kick twice as high . And you , what are you doing ? Kick , kick , kick . Agh ! That was good . No more kicks . Punch ! Punch ! No pain , no gain ! No aim ! See what I 'm saying ? Focus those punches . Hwah ! For every death , a birth . For every pain , a pleasure . Strike like lightning . Sting like the acid rain . Between the darkness and the light is the balance of all things . Hyuh ! Hyuh ! We are in a war . We 're soldiers ! All right ? Let 's just look like soldiers . Why ? Because we are bad fighters . Hyuh ! Hyuh ! When that balance is tilted , nature rejects us . Focus on your punches . Hyuh ! Hyuh ! And as surely as the seed will flower from the scorched soil , so will hope return . Hope will have the shape of a man - Fist ... of the North Star . You must turn Kenshiro 's heart , Lynn . Kenshiro-o-o-o ! How long does the water-fly live ? A day in the life of Man ? A blink of an eye for the gods ? And still his time is longer than the time a man may deny his destiny ! Kenshiro , my son , we will talk . You are in default of your destiny ! No , Father ! My destiny is hate . And revenge ! The choice is not yours to make . When I died , you became the Fist . - No ! - What is , is . By your own hand , you have set your destiny in motion . - Fist of the North Star ! - No ! No ! It won 't hold ! We need to secure it . Let 's go . Come on , we haven 't got all day ! You ! Get those children to the shelter . Now ! Get those bottles to the gas depot . Move it ! What are you doing ? Stop it ! Those bombs will destroy everything we 've worked for . Right , Neville , let 's surrender and be happy slaves Fighting will be suicide . I suggest we open negotiations . Animals do not negotiate ! What do you have in mind ? A treaty proposing shared water rights with the city of Southern Cross . We will send an envoy to seek a peaceful settlement . - How many bombs can we make ? - Not enough . You people are crazy ! 'You are in default of your destiny . ' Aghh ! 'The choice is not yours to make . ' Kenshiro ! Julia ! - Aghh ! - ' Fist of the North Star ! ' Hwah ! Hwii ! Rr-r-r-rah ! Hyeee-aah ! The pants will fit . I want the pants ! - Stop ! - Hey , come here ! Come here ! - Hey , stop ! - Get out of there ! Get out ! - Stop it ! - Come on ! Get him ! Come on , you ! Hyah ! - Yaah ! - Hyuh ! You 're really good . But I could have taken them , I was just warming up . - Thank you . - Did you follow me ? Yeah . Don 't you wanna know why I 'm here ? - No . - Lynn sent me . It 's Paradise Valley - the Crossmen are coming ! - Not these Crossmen . - Real Crossmen ! These guys are AWOLs . Agh ! Hee-yaah ! - What was that all about ? - You 've wasted your time . I 've got business to the south . Hey . Hey ! Hey ! OK . OK . This is not the quickest route to Paradise Valley but we can work on it . We 're fighters . We can trade shots . And I owe you one ! We will never retreat from our conquest ! We will crush our enemy and we will give ourselves to our flag our empire and our Lord Shin ! Today we ride on the back of a tiger . And that tiger is hungry ! These are not my words . But I do feel them ! But my words say this - let 's kill some people ! - Kill ! Kill ! - Yeah ! Let 's kill them ! And let 's enjoy it ! Let 's go ! Kill them ! Aaghh ! Help ! Leave him alone ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Hey , Stone ! Come here ! I got something for you ! Rr-au-au ! Burn , motherfucker ! That 's right . Burn ! Enjoying yourself , sir ? It ain 't easy bein ' sleazy . - My father was right . - Whatever you say . I have no choice. I opened her eyes . Quiet ! OK ? Lynn ? Are you talking about Lynn ? - Let 's go . - Whatever you say ! Take this load of shit to Southern Cross . Which one 's the engineer ? - Which one ? - Me ! Plans will arrive . You 'll build . I 'll build nothing , you ugly son of a bitch ! Work ... means life . Life is nothing without freedom . Freedom 's worth nothing without life ! That 's right . - Oh . A man who understands logic . - l accept reality . We can work together to assure a brighter future for both peoples . Him I like . Her ... we need . - Him ... - Yeah ? Kill that brown-nosing sack of shit before I puke all over myself . - Gotcha . - Please ! I don 't wanna die ! There 'll be no treaty ! - No ! - No partnership ! Complete obedience ... or death ! Welcome to the future . It 'll be great . Once we clean up the place , we can clean up . You can join our act . With your kicks and ... whah ! ... my kicks OK , mostly your kicks ... we could eat like kings ! Huh ? King Arthur and Sir Lancelot . This needs to be much higher . Hey ! Get back there , you old bitch ! Get your ass out of there ! - Like the man said , no water . - But I 'll die . Then die . - You feel better now ? - l 'm starting to . - Get out of there ! - Let me go , you ugly bastard ! - Hey ! - What 's going on ? - You making trouble , cutie ? - Don 't touch me ! Gumption . You see that ? It 's brand-new . And you 're the first one that gets to ride on it . - No ! - Set her up . - No ! - Come on ! - Grab her ! - Might ... is right ! Dissent ... is intolerable ! Move out ! Move out ! Have mercy . Touch me again and your head 's next , you old bitch . Next life , watch your mouth . Kill her . Kenshiro will make you pay ! You have something to tell me , little one ? Take her ! Go to Shin . Tell him " seven wounds " . I 'll take her. I 'll take her . You 're a tough kid. I like that . Leave me alone ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Fry , baby ! They 've got the whole city blocked . Only on the surface . It 'll take us right into town. lt 's over this way . This way ! Come on ! Right over here . Trapped in the past . I 've burned the past , like the houses of my enemies . My future will rise from the scorched earth . Julia ... I am saving the world . Aqueducts , railways . Cities . Can 't you try and understand me ? If only you 'd open your eyes . I 'm doing everything for you . Without you ... the future is meaningless . Julia ... I need you . You 're the future , Kenshiro . Fist of the North Star . The people need you . You can 't deny your destiny . You 're beginning to sound like my father . Come on , Julia , feel my hands . I want you to concentrate . Those hands ... hold the future . These seeds hold the future . Now you hold it . I protect them , Kenshiro . Meanwhile protect yourself . Kenshiro , my friend . - Julia . - Shin . Playing soldier ? I 'm not playing . The world needs a leader . - Did it choose you ? - l chose it . - He chose nothing . - He is nothing . Slitting your wrists will be quicker . - ls that a fact ? - And less painful . - OK . - You have my permission . Thank you . - You 're gonna die ! - Hai ... yah ! Kenshiro ! Kenshiro ! Hwah-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h ! - Huah ! Hah ! - Daagh ! My head ! What did you do to me ? We 're friends , Shin . What are you doing ? You have betrayed your teachings . The North Star and Southern Cross - are no longer in balance . - Shin , no ! Don 't do this ! I 'm not doing this . He is ! North Star and Southern Cross must never fight . That is the teaching . And the teaching is true . But there is no North Star . No ! No ! No , Kenshiro ! - Aagghh ! - Shin , no ! Don 't do this ! Ee-yah ! - Pick him up ! - No ! Kenshiro ! - Kenshiro ! - Julia , tell me you love me . Never ! I love Kenshiro ! Shin ! No ! No ! - No , Shin ! - Agghh ! Tell me you love me ! Never ! Never ! Agghh ! Stop ! No ! Tell me ! Tell me you love me ! No ! I love you ! I love you , Shin ! Julia ! Aaaagghhh ! I love you , too . Take her . Kenshiro ! Kenshiro ! No ! No ! Kenshiro ! Kenshiro-o-o-o ! Think of this as you breathe your last . I killed your father , too . Stop looking at the past ! Hit me , Shin . Kill me . I am already dead . Look there ! - Look at the way she 's been ... - l know ! Put me to sleep ! Somebody shut her up . Hey , sweetsie ! Ooh ! - Go to sleep ! - Shut up ! Who conquered who , shit-brains ? I come here looking for Southern Cross soldiers ... and find a bunch of wet-eyed peons ! - Sir , I ... - Shut up ! the only singing I wanna hear from you is the whereabouts of your friend , Kenshiro . Goliath ! Tell these peons what it means to be a Crossman . Find out what she knows about the man with seven wounds . We gotta find Lynn . We gotta find her ! We 'll find her . Kenshiro . Lynn . Shh , shh , shh . Calm down . Calm down . Shh . Shh . Who did this to you ? Their son-of-bitch leader . He did this to me . - Where 's Lynn ? - Lynn ? She kept talking about somebody coming . Nobody came . They 've all died . No heroes . - Where 's Lynn ? - He has her . Him and that giant . - Let 's go . - Wait . I 'll get Lynn . I need you to stay here . All right . I 'm unstoppable ! Tell us what we want to know ! - Or I 'll kill you ! - No ! Then you 'll die in this cage ! Fly , little bird ! Get out ! It 's you ! I knew ! - Run home ! Find Bat . - But ... Go. I 'll find you . Hee-taaah ! Hyee ! Oh , good ! A real fight ! Your last . No pain , brother . No pain ! Bat ? Bat ? Bat ? Bat . I hear your friend 's in town , sweetheart . Lord Shin won 't be requiring your services any longer . Oof ! Fight somebody who can fight back , you piece of Crossman trash . Eeohh ! Look out ! He 's got a knife ! Kids are such suckers ! Are there any more heroes ? - Grrr ... . - Hai ! - Wugh ! - Ha ! Hyah ! Who ... are you ? The Fist ... of the North Star ! Aaghh ... Yii-ah ! Heeyah ! Hold him . I almost beat him. I ... I almost won . You did win , Bat . Paradise Valley is free again , thanks to you . - Wh ... Where 's my sister ? - Here , Bat. I 'm here . Did you hear him ? I 'm a hero ! Yes , Bat . You are a hero . Stop ! Father ? Revenge is unworthy of you . You must go face Shin - not to avenge betrayal , but to restore balance . The past is done . The future is yours to shape . We 'll look after the child . Go . Tell Shin the flag of the North Star flies over Paradise Valley . Julia must not know he 's alive . Guard her . Don 't take your eyes off her . There you are . Sweet dreams ? - What happened ? Where is Shin ? - Afraid I can 't tell you that . Let 's just say he had ... personal business to attend to . - What am I doing here ? - Nothing yet , baby . - What do you wanna do ? - Get away ! No. I 'm in charge of watching you . How d 'you like them apples ? Sometimes the fox gets a break . You and me are gonna be ... pretty good friends by the end of the night . Just you ... and your pal , Jackal . Curfew ! Quickly come ! All right . More for me . Don 't touch me ! I like touching you . I like touching you so much . Gumption ! Call me old-fashioned , but I like that. I like it ! Double gumption . I think I 'm falling for you , Your Highness . Please ... come with me . You know , I 'm not afraid of them . I could take both of ' em . Shin 's lost it . Power corrupts a man . As you well know . Clock 's ticking . Could go either way upstairs . Could go this way ... Could go that way ... Then , don 't know what the hell I 'm talkin ' about , do you ? But if it goes my way , I sure am gonna have a lot of fun with you before we all go to hell . What ? There 's something moving under here . Let Jackal take care of you . What ... I don 't hear anything . Run , doll. I can hear you running , little piggy . And you 've made this big , bad wolf very happy . Ow ! - Hweh-ii aaa ! - Agghh ! Uh ! Oogh ! Aagh ! Oo ... Hyaa ... Ohh ! - Eeee-yaah ! - Aaagh ... Eee-yah ! Yaa ! Hyaah ! Your Highness ! Attempting to escape ... is a felony ! And the punishment is at the discretion of the officer in charge . And that 's me ! Jackal ! Ken . It 's surprisingly good to see you . - What have you been up to ? - Ruining your plans . I 'd call it standing in the way of progress . It 's a new world , my brother . Shaped by my dreams . Your dreams are over . Walk away . And let the future commence , unhindered by such ghosts of the past as you . You always did love the sound of your own voice , didn 't you , Shin ? A little teasing ? A little foreplay ? I can work with that . Hee-yah ! Hi-yah ! Hey-yah ! lmprovement . Heee-yah ! - Doesn 't make any difference . - Hey-ee ... Ah ! I see through all your moves , Shin . Wh-aa ! Hii-yah ! Hoo-waah ! Whhaaah ! Yeah ! A-a-a-ayy-naaah ! Kenshiro , wait ! I almost forgot. I have some sad news . Julia my most ... skilful lover ... Your Highness ? .. is dead . H-h-h-yuh ! Agghh ! Waahh ! Hyuhhh ! Agghh ! Ahh-h ! Bad girl ! Very bad girl ! Gotta learn a lesson ! I 'm ... gonna ... teach you ! Uhh-a-a-ah ! Uu-yy-uuuuh ! Julia ! Kenshiro . Oh , how sweet His name 's the last word out of your mouth before it fills with your dying blood . You had a throne . Now you 're flat on your back like a good little bitch ! From now on , till I let you die , that 's all there is . I can hurt you for as long as I want . All the while , Kenshiro upstairs . You can 't even say goodbye . Does that hurt ? Think about that ! Hyuh ! Hah ! Heee-yah ! Aghh ... Hya-a-a-a-ah-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee ! Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ya-ya-ya ! The North Star and the Southern Cross should never have fought . That ... was the teaching . The teachings are true . But there is no Southern Cross . H-h-e-e-e-ey-ah ! Hey-ey-ey-ey-yaah ! You 've ruined my life , Shin . You 've ruined all our lives ! Kenshiro ... All this ... all this ... was my vision . Julia she had nothing to do with it . Nothing . She 's alive ? No . She 's dead . He-e-e-y-y-uh ! Fist of the North Star .

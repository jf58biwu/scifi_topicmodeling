 Get away ! Shoo ! Get away . Shoo ! RBP to field base , come in . Field base , come in , please . This is Dr Robert Torrence with the Biodiversity Project ... .. requesting immediate evacuation from Sector Z15 . This is a medical emergency . Please respond . I repeat : Dr Robert Torrence , Biodiversity Project . Immediate evacuation from Sector Z15 . Esperen un momento . Oyeron eso ? - Vamos . Siganme . - Adelante . Qué es ? Esta vivo ? Hey , Bobby ! You got some mail . Don 't waste my time , Winston . Both of us know I ain 't got nobody . Could be those Baptists from Annandale . I hear they 've been sending fruitcake . Hey , Winston ! You think this is funny ? What kind of crap you tryin ' to pull here ? Get this thing out of my crib ! Winston ! Winston ! Winston ! Winston ! - When was he exposed ? - 18 hours ago . It incubated so quickly . Where 's the prison doc ? I wanna see the prison doc . We 're specialists , Mr Torrence . What 's wrong with me ? Five centimeters . They appear fairly uniform . - Basal temperature ? - 103.5 . Oxygen saturation : 81 per cent . - What 's wrong with me ? - Try and relax , Mr Torrence . We 're here to help you . Put the sheets in the cart . Make sure and get all them pillows , too . I 'll be back in five minutes . We 'll be here . See that ? Like he couldn 't clear out of here fast enough . The whole cell block 's empty . McGuire says they 're full up at the infirmary . - Bringing in more beds . - Yeah , well , ... .. it 's probably something going around . - Maybe . - What ? You know somethin ' ? I know those sheets ain 't going to the laundry . McGuire says they 're going to some kind of incinerator . But the laundry pick-up 's still happening . According to my briefing , the prisoners escaped by hiding in a laundry cart . The guards don 't watch enough prison movies . And they 're both serving life terms . - Murder convictions . - Everybody 's here . I thought this was about escaped prisoners . It is . Then who are the men in the funny suits ? I don 't know . It looks like some kind of decon situation . FBI running out of crooked politicians to sting ? Excuse me ? Mulder and , uh , Scully ? That 's right . We have orders to work with the federal marshals on this manhunt . Either of you two ever run an escaped-convict operation ? No . Then you 'd be a big help if you just try to stay out of the way . Well , we 'd be happy to , as soon as we can talk to someone who 's in charge . - I 'm in charge . - Apparently not . Or you 'd know why our involvement was requested . We don 't know why we 're here . If we saw the warden ... No one 's here . It 's been taken over by the National Guard . - They 've closed off most of the facility . - Why ? I don 't know . A federal marshal 's business isn 't in here . It 's out there trying to catch those two convicts . - Where did this case originate , Scully ? - It came out of Skinner 's office . - Did he say why he gave it to us ? - No . Why ? Well , this isn 't the type of thing the FBI normally gets called in on . I got a feeling we 're not being told the entire story . I 've got the same feeling , Mulder . You think you can find out what 's going on ? I can try . - Where are you going ? - To see if I can get in the way . Hey , you girls go with Mom . I 'll see you in a minute . Robert ? Robert ? Robert ! Whooo-whooo ! Hey ! Robert ? - Whoo ! Whoo ! Whoo ! - Hey ! Hey ! - I 'm sorry . This is a restricted area . - Who are you ? - Dr Osborne . - Are you the prison doctor ? - No . - Who do you work for ? The CDC . You work for the Centers for Disease Control . What are you doing here ? Sir ? I 'm a medical doctor . I wanna know what 's going on here . If you don 't let me in , a lot of people in Washington are gonna find out ... .. that you 're conducting a secret quarantine in here . - I 'm under strict orders . - So am I. There is a flu-like illness spreading amongst the prisoners . - How many people are infected ? - 14 men so far . - Any deaths ? - 10 ... of the 14 . What are the chances the men who escaped are infected ? They just took off . Can you believe that ? - Mulder . - Mulder , it 's me . I 'm starting to get a picture of what 's going on . - What did you find ? - There 's a deadly contagion ... - .. sweeping the lockdown population . - Deadly ? How deadly ? Well , from what I 've seen so far ... 36 hours after infection deadly . Is there a chance any of the escaped men were infected ? The exact nature of this thing is unclear . So is their exposure to it and any danger they might pose . I 'd say these guys are a danger in any event . Let 's get him out . I don 't care who you are . I want you out of here right now . - Not until I get answers . - You 're in violation of federal statutes . - I 'm a federal agent , sir . - Who were you on the phone to ? My partner . He needs to know if the escaped men are infected . That information is unavailable . Then I wanna see charts and I want access to the infirmary . You see what I let you see . Hello ? I 'm free , baby . - Paul ? - Listen . I 'm gonna ... - Where are you ? - I 'm coming home . - What are you talking about ? - I 'm coming to get ya . What ? What ? Yo ! Anybody in here ? Hello ? Hey , man . Are you OK ? You look messed up . Hey , man ... You can 't be down here . I need to know what they 're dying from . You said this was some kind of a flu-like illness . - What are these ? - The bodies should not be exposed . Do all of the victims have these boils ? You 're burning the bodies . Why ? Dr Osborne , wait ! Freeze ! Hands in the air ! Freeze ! Freeze ! Clear ! We got a man down ! He 's alive ! Attendant is Angelo Garza . He took a crack to the head , but he 's talking . Lucky they didn 't kill him . Kid 's got a lot of hair . Probably absorbed the blow . He found one of the men in pain on the bathroom floor with a boil on his face . There 's a contagion at the prison . These men could be infected . Get on the horn . See what anybody knows about that . They took the kid 's keys and got in the safe . They got money , a car , ... .. possibly a firearm , and they got a big head start . - Either of them got a girlfriend ? - Those records are locked up in the prison . For now , this is Smokey and the Bandit . If they did , they probably tried to call them . Did you think of that ? This is the operator . How may I help you ? I 'm a federal agent assisting in a manhunt for two prisoners . My badge number is : JTT047101111 . I need to know the last call made from this booth . All right , sir . One moment , please . That number is 555-6936 . - Can you repeat that , please ? - 555-6936 . All right , thank you . What 's going on here ? Hey ! What are you guys doing here ? Hey , what the hell 's going on here ? Who authorised this ? - Are you gonna do anything about this ? - What 's going on ? What 's going on ? ! Where are they taking me ? Who are you ? - Hey , did you order this ? - No . - Then who the hell did ? - I don 't know . There was a call made ... .. from that booth two hours ago . I got an address and number for Dinwiddie County . Wait here , sweetie . I 'll be right back . - I thought you were BS-ing me . - I 'm gone , sweet thing . - They ain 't never takin ' me back . - I ain 't gonna let them . - Mommy ! Mommy ! - I 'm coming , sweetie . Daddy 's home . Come on . - I got somebody with me . - What ? What 's wrong with him ? I don 't know . He 's out of it . - Oh , hell . He 's burning up . - We gotta get him in the house . Can I help you ? Yes . I 'm trying to trace the origin of a package that was sent to ... Do you have the package ID number ? Yeah , the package ID number is DDP112148 . Sure , I 'll hold . Are you there ? It was sent from Wichita , Kansas . The package was sent from Wichita , Kansas ? Did you record the name of the sender ? It says here it was sent from Pinck Pharmaceuticals . - Could you check that again , please ? - Sure . - Yes , ma 'am . That 's what it says . - Thank you . Yeah ? What do you know about Pinck Pharmaceuticals ? It 's one of , if not the biggest , manufacturer of drugs in America . Why ? They sent a package to a prisoner who may have been the first victim of the contagion . - Any idea what was in the package ? - No . It 's empty . From the description , one prisoner had a large , purplish inflammation on his face . That sounds like what I 'm finding on all the victims in here . - Do you know what that means , Mulder ? - It could spread . I need to know more . - How it 's transmitted . - I 'm on it . Gotta go . Gotta keep movin ' . Paul ! Paul , he 's awake . Paul , come here ! You gotta help me . I 'm ... I 'm burning up here . Please . Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! Paul ! We got one prisoner dead in the bedroom . The other one 's gone . Charlie , why don 't you get the boy ? - Come with me . - Why ? What 's going on ? Just come with me . What the hell is going on ? I 've been infected . They 're not letting me out . The entire prison 's been quarantined . - By who ? The CDC ? - The CDC has nothing to do with this . It 's the company . They 're behind everything . Pinck Pharmaceuticals . You work for Pinck Pharmaceuticals ? How did this happen ? We finance exploration of new species from the rain forest ... .. with potential drug applications . Three months ago , a field entomologist disappeared in Costa Rica . - Disappeared how ? - We 're not sure . He just sent us some samples of an insect . Like this ? I found this buried in one of the dead prisoners . Faciphaga emasculata . We were interested in it because of a dilating enzyme it secretes . Is this what caused the outbreak ? No . No , not precisely . F. emasculata is a parasitoid - a bug that carries a parasite . In this case , a deadly parasite that attacks the immune system . The pustules are part of the natural reproductive cycle . They 're full of the larvae that you see there on the scope . So the contagion only spreads when the pustules erupt . And the larvae that are expelled burrow into the new host . Agent Scully ... you were there when the pustule erupted on me . Which means you may also be infected . Come in . - Thank you for seeing me at this late hour . - What is it ? This case we 've been assigned . I believe we 've been misled . Possibly deceived . - Deceived ? By whom ? - Whoever originated the case . What is the accusation , Agent Mulder ? That we were sent on this manhunt without knowledge of the existence of the contagion . - What is the exact nature of the contagion ? - It 's deadly . It kills within 36 hours . One escaped convict was infected - he 's dead now . The other man may be infected and he 's on the loose . Does anyone know whether it 's a virus or a bacteria ? We know that over a dozen men have died from it . It appears to be highly contagious . - Then you don 't know much . - Why weren 't we told the truth ? We didn 't know the truth . What we knew would have slowed you down . Innocent people could be infected . You could have prevented that . How ? In 1988 there was an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Sacramento . The truth would have caused panic . Panic would have cost lives . We controlled it by controlling information . You can 't protect the public by lying . It 's done every day . I won 't be a party to it . How about you ? You 're a party to it already . How many people are being infected while you stand here not doing your job ? Ten ? Twenty ? What 's the truth , Agent Mulder ? - Mulder . - Mulder , they 're enforcing a full quarantine . What ? One of the epidemiologists who claimed to be with the CDC ... .. told me that this was no accident . Pinck Pharmaceutical is here trying to clean it up quietly . - And the government would have to know . - Do you have proof of that ? Why else would the National Guard be here ? They 're protecting Pinck Pharmaceutical . I need to know how this happened . Document everything you can get your hands on . - People have to know about the cover-up . - The public ? It 's a public-health crisis . We can 't leak this . Not until we know more . The fugitive you 're looking for might not even be infected . - What if he is ? - If this gets out , ... .. the panic is gonna spread faster than the contagion . We can 't let this be known . What if someone dies because we withheld what we knew ? What if someone dies because we didn 't ? There ' II be a time for the truth , Mulder , but this isn 't it . Are you OK in there , Scully ? Yeah . I 'm OK . All I want you to worry about is capturing that fugitive . Take care of yourself , Mulder . If you 're not infected , you should leave immediately . And if I am ? The parasite is undetectable in the bloodstream . This is the only way to test whether or not you 've been infected . These uninfected insects act as incubators . Now the insect 's bite won 't infect you . The contagion can only be contracted through exposure to the larvae . How long will this take ? Thirty minutes . Then another two hours ... .. before the parasite reproduces enough for us to see it . Elizabeth ? My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm with the FBI . - Where did Paul go , Elizabeth ? - I don 't know . I think you do know . And I think you know why you 're in here . - How are you feeling ? - I 'm fine . Steve felt fine too . It didn 't take long for that to change . - You 're just tryin ' to scare me . - You should be scared . - If I were you , I 'd be scared . - You 're lyin ' ! Paul is the one who was lying . And if he 's infected , a lot of people are gonna die . If that 's true , how come it 's not on TV ? How come they 're not tellin ' everybody ? - That 's not my decision . - Well , whose decision is it ? You knew about it and you didn 't say anything . Why should I tell the truth if you won 't ? Elizabeth , Paul is out there somewhere . I have to find him . Now you can help me ... .. or not . Ten o 'clock bus to Toronto . She was supposed to be with him . That bus depot 's over a half-hour from here . Get on to the local PD . They don 't know what they 're dealing with . If he 's infected , he could spread it . What we need now is control . Toronto , one way ? Yes . Now ... once we harvest the blood from the insect ... The toxins ... they 're moving into my brain just like it did on the prisoners . I don 't have much longer . I need you to help me . What do you want me to do ? Go on . You have to complete the test . Why did you confide in me ? It 's not a secret I feel like taking to the grave . People have a right to know the danger we put them in . If your test comes back negative ... you have to tell them . How can I prove it ? I don 't know . But if you don 't , it 'll just happen again . Don 't believe for a second that this is an isolated incident . Your attention , please . Bus number 953 ... - Wait a second . - I don 't wanna miss the bus . You see that ? They 're still loading the luggage . You 're not missing anything . You have enough time to give your mother a kiss goodbye . Ticket . Be careful . Say hi to Uncle Jay . Hey ! What 's the time ? Twenty to ten . - What are you doing ? - This material will be destroyed ... .. according to standard CDC procedure . You don 't work for the CDC . Where 's Dr Osborne ? - He told me what happened here . - What happened here was unavoidable . - We 'll leave that up to others to decide . - Dr Osborne is dead . No one in this room will corroborate your story . Just be glad this thing is under control . Would the driver of bus number 25 to Pittsburgh come to the dispatch ofﬁce ? Your attention , please . Announcing the arrival of bus number 126 ... - He 's here . He bought a ticket to Toronto . - Son of a bitch . And he 's infected . - Mulder . - Mulder , ... .. I think everything here is under control . - You OK , Scully ? - Yeah . - Have you found the second prisoner ? - Yeah . He 's headed to Toronto . He 's alive ? Mulder , listen to me . Everything here has been destroyed . Any evidence whatsoever of a cover-up has been incinerated . That prisoner is the last man who could possibly connect the conspirators . - He 's infected . He 's gonna die . - If you want the truth , ... .. he 's gonna have to make a statement . Hold your men back . I 'm getting on the bus . We 've got the situation controlled . That bus isn 't going anywhere . The prisoner sees a uniform , he could panic . He panics , and innocent people die . - What you do wanna do ? - I take the seat behind the prisoner . I put my gun to his head . I make an announcement to clear the bus . Thank you . Can you take your seat , sir ? - There 's supposed to be a man on the bus . - I 've got a schedule to keep . Now please , take your seat , or I 'm gonna have to ask you to get off . Take the key out of the ignition and turn around slowly . - What is this ? - I 'm with the FBI . I need to know if this man has boarded the bus . Yeah . That 's him , right back there . Federal agent ! Drop your weapon ! Plan A has gone to hell . Get ready . - Let the boy go ! - Move the damn bus ! You got over two dozen US marshals out there , Paul . How far are you gonna get ? I 'm dying , ain 't I ? The question is , how many people are you gonna take with you ? - What is this thing ? - You were infected in prison . - It 's what Bobby Torrence had . - And your girlfriend , Elizabeth . And possibly your son . How many more people do you want to expose ? It came from that package in Bobby 's cell , didn 't it ? You saw a package ? What the hell was it ? All right , everybody off the bus . Just keep going . Just go . Just go . Keep moving . All right , come on out . It 's OK . Come on , just slide out . I 'm here for you . That 's it . Come on . All right . All right , Paul . What was in that package ? What was in that package ? A pharmaceutical company was using you as a guinea pig . If you tell me what was in that package , I 'll make sure they don 't get away with it . Come on , Paul . You remember . Tell me ! Get him off the bus . Get him outta there . You have to get off . Let 's go . Get off . Robert Torrence was patient zero - the first prisoner to contract the disease . Before going to the infirmary , he received a package from Pinck Pharmaceuticals . They orchestrated this to circumvent years of FDA trials , ... - .. to get their drug on the market . - Why are you telling me this ? I wanted you to hear from me before you read it in the papers . I 'd seriously reconsider bringing this to the media . The public should know , so it doesn 't happen again . You 're gonna prove this conspiracy with an empty package and a dead insect ? Leave it alone . The epidemic was contained . 18 people are dead . And if you 're helping them cover the truth , you 're just as guilty as they are . You really have no idea who you 're dealing with , do you ? I thought I was dealing with you . - We can 't prove a thing . They 've made sure . - What are you talking about ? The Costa Rican government faxed me the report on the missing scientist . His name was Robert Torrence , the same as our prisoner . It was their fail-safe in case it came to this . They could blame it on a simple postal error . A mistake . Hmm . That 's why we were given this assignment , right ? They knew all along . So that even if we succeeded in finding the truth , we 'd be discredited as part of it . Am I right ? - Am I right ? ! - You never had a chance , Agent Mulder . For every step you take , they 're three ahead . Where do you stand ? I stand right on the line that you keep crossing . Come on , let 's go . Agent Mulder . I 'm saying this as a friend . Watch your back . This is just the beginning . I made this !

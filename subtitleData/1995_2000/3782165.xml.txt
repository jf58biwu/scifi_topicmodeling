 We 've been up here for hours . If you ask me , the only thing we 're going to find is more nothing . You call all this nothing ? Wake me when you see a door with an exit sign . Come on woman , where 's your sense of wonder ? Back at the treehouse on that second glass of wine . We 're losing light Challenger ... best land and make camp . Nobody said anything about camping . I was saving it ... for a surprise . There we go . Take a damn hurricane to pry it loose . All right , all right I 'm not a pack mule . Just a few more things . How about a hand ? Ah ! yes of course . I 'll go get the firewood . That does it . That 's far enough . Timing is everything . Last time I play Good Samaritan . You all right ? Son of a bitch tried to bite me . Can you believe that ? As a matter of fact I can . We 'd better get you back to camp and get that cleaned out . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . At the dawn of the century ... a band of adventures set out to prove the impossible ... the existence of a prehistoric world ... The Visionary ... The Heiress ... The Hunter ... The Scientist ... and The Reporter . All chasing the story of a lifetime . Stranded in a savage land Befriended by an untamed beauty Together they fight to survive . In this amazing world of lost civilizations ... and terrifying creatures . Always searching for a way home . A way out of ... the Lost World Remind me again why I 'm helping burying someone you shot . Predators ... they smell a decaying body next they smell us . So unless you 'd like a little company tonight . Not even in your dreams . Almost done , just a few more Marguerite . Predators ... if you ask me we buried the only predator for miles around . - Hey - What is it ? Speak up . Interesting ... there appear to be bite marks on the neck of the animal . Must be something in the air tonight . Those are teeth marks . That 's peculiar , there 's no blood ... there 's no blood anywhere . Drained of blood ? Oh wonderful ! Well it 's obvious the dead guy was a vampire . I was joking . I knew there was something in the air tonight . It 's getting late ... we better get back to the burial . Really I swear . I wonder who did it . Incredible ... barbecued ... what did you say it was ? On second thought maybe it 's better to live in the mystery . I 'm glad you 're here . You are ? Sure ... I mean all of you of course . Of course . I guess I was lonely . Someone as wonderful as you ... should never have to feel lonely . Thank you , Ned Malone ... just for that ... you get to do the dishes . - Where are you going ? - You 'll see . I touched her face ... someone as wonderful as you ... then I kissed her . Ned ? What are you doing ? Come on in . I 'm not going to ask twice . Hang on I 'm coming ... just a second ... almost there . Hey Veronica that 's no fair . Veronica . Shouldn 't you be on watch ? Shhhh not now . This is a dream I 've had before . Roxton , slow down . Roxton ! Stop it . Let go of me . Stop it ! Roxton ! Get of her , John ! Roxton ! I do tend to bring out the beast in a man . I see we have the same problem . I 'm sorry . Couldn 't sleep . Me neither ... Professor ? Yes . I have a situation . Oh ! I 'm sure she 'd understand . Who ? You 're young lady back home what 's her name ? Gladys . Oh yes , lovely name Gladys ... then so is Veronica . That 's the problem ... I mean ... I love Gladys ... but for all she knows I might be dead . Indeed ! So it wouldn 't be like ... being unfaithful , would it ? What do you think , professor ? I think it 's about time for one of us ... to go to bed , goodnight Ned . Thanks ... for nothing . [ scream ] Veronica ? What 's wrong you 're shaking ? I don 't know . There was someone ... a man right there where you are now . There 's nobody here but us , my dear , you had a nightmare . Dark skin , brown eyes ... his hand was reaching out ... Ah it seems so real . Sometimes the night can play strange tricks . It 's forty feet to the ground . Hell of a jump if he was for real ... unless your mystery man can fly . All right look I 've changed my mind ... I don 't care if we ever see him again . Now can we take a break ? Look at this ... we 're on the right track , this way . It 's just a broken branch for all we know ... it could be a stampede of bunny rabbits . With a size eleven boot . Oh no , it 's Roxton all right ... this way . Right behind you bwana . I feel so foolish . I don 't think you were foolish at all . I 'm not usually that jumpy . I 'm glad you were . It gave me another chance to see you last night . Ahem . Pardon my ... I mean our intrusion but he absolutely insisted . My nightmare . I am Niko ... your husband . Welcome my love . Where am I ? You 've come home . So you 're saying you want to buy Veronica ? It is the way of my tribe . You 've got to be joking . We 'll actually Ned there are countries in the world ... Africa for example , where the men purchase their wives with cattle . Yeah ... but where I come from guy does something like this ... gets his head wrapped around a fire plug . The woman Veronica is she yours ? Excuse me ! We 're not in Africa , I don 't go moo ... and I 'm not for sale . It 's a very flattering offer ... but no thank you and goodbye . So the woman is yours . Yes Veronica is mine . Ned , don 't ! I understand ... you will consider my offer ... I will return for your answer . And if he refuses ? We 'll fight to the death . - All yours ? - Yes . a little bit of home right here in the jungle . You 'd almost forgotten what it could be like , didn 't you ? Yes ! Not yet , my pet . There is something to be said for anticipation . My chest ... it 's so tight . What is it ? The transformation has begun . What the hell 's happening to me ? You 're awakening my love . Some may say you 've been infected with a disease but ... they have no soul ... no passion . It 's no disease , it 's a gift . Tell me are you ready ? Are you hungry ? Drink ... more take it all . Oh my god . Or at least the next best thing ... don 't be afraid accept the gift . Impossible . Nothing is impossible anymore ... see what life can be like ... feel it . You ... you did this to me . That 's it , come on . Surrender to the hunger ... surrender to yourself . Damn you ! Oh yes , yes . Could swear we 're walking around in circles . That 's because Roxton 's doubled back . Well if he doesn 't want to be found . What the hell is that ? Are you crazy ? It 's dead ... the body 's still warm . There 's a few wound marks made with something long and sharp . A knife ? Look at this . Do I have to ? More bite marks on the neck small but they 're still there . I 'll take your word for it . What kind of a creature does that ? Oh my god . Size eleven boots . And we know who wears those . I 'm the one thing in life you need not fear . Beautiful ... the first time I saw you my heart stopped beating . There was only your face , your smile . Even the jungle was quiet ... as if my love shamed the animals into silence . There are a lot of women . From your own tribe even . No , you do not understand . I was a young boy , six maybe seven years old . That was the first time I saw you . You saw ... me so many years ago ? In my dream . Your dream ? And a thousand others since then . Tell me you have not dreamed of me . Our dreams are prophecy . We are meant to be together . Without you I 'm only half of myself . No ah ... please , leave . It 's amazing ! What is this feeling ? The absence of fear ... you belong now ... to me . To the stars ... you 're the tiniest particle on the farthest planet from the sun . You 're the secret thoughts and dreams of everyone you 've ever known ... or loved , or lost . The Universe is yours for the taking . I 'll never leave you . One day you 'll try to kill me . Never . An instinct eats away your reason . It will happen , but not today . You 're talking nonsense . My father 's phrase was natural selection . Your father ... where 's your family now ? Right in there . My father was bitten by a feral beast ... and that night he killed mother and our four men . He fed on me . He couldn 't bring himself to kill me ... his love was that strong ... The following night ... his hunger was stronger . But you 're still alive . Of course , by then I was hungry too ... as I said , natural selection . What 's that ? Fresh blood my love ... fresh blood . Two of them ... one for each of us ... are you sure you 're ready . I 'm ready . I 'll go first ... alone . There 's no turning back . They 're my friends , they 'll trust me . All right my love ... but hurry , I 'm hungry . Tell me you see what I see . Who in the hell would build that in the middle of the jungle ? Shhh . - I beg your pardon ? - Quiet woman someone 's coming . - Roxton . - It 's about time . Run ! Run , damn you ! Take it easy old man . Are you deaf ? Run ! - Come on . - We can 't leave him . We know where he is , we 'll be back . This is ridiculous I don 't think there 's much doubt about that . You can 't fight Niko . Who then Summerlee , you ? Why not ? Did I ask for your protection ? You didn 't have to . I don 't need a hero . Either I fight him or he takes you as his bride . I don 't see any other option . Maybe I do . You send them away ? Don 't you ever ... do that again . I should let you die . But I have grown ... so attached to you already . Marguerite ... Challenger , they 're my friends . You only have ... one friend now my love . See the way your chest is heaving ... feel your blood on fire ? How long has it been since you fed ? Come to me . Patience ... Now ! What the hell are you doing ? Eliminating your confusion . Put it down . Don 't test me . I 'll only disappoint you . You let your friends escape because you weren 't hungry enough ... Soon your cravings will become ravings ... your desire madness . Soon you will do anything to eat . I 've never seen anything like it . Did you see Roxton 's face ... skin , eyes . Must be a fever ... some sort of disease . What ? Let 's say that poor man that attack Roxton ... passed on a germ , a contagion . One rabid animal infecting another . And it 's infected his mind . Sweating , labored breathing ... oxygen deprivation of the blood . That 's a lovely theory but meanwhile what happens if he goes for our throats . Roxton ... it 's me Challenger ! Roxton ! Come on man . I never thought I 'd say this but I don 't want to shoot you . Please , John ! Thank you . Your aim was rather wide of the market my dear . I guess my heart wasn 't in it . What do we do with him now ? We have no choice ... we have to poison him . What ? Once more please , we poison Roxton to cure him ? The infection is destroying his red blood cells . We attack it the same way as we attack cancer . We toxify his blood ... and the bacteria can 't survive . Remind me never to get sick around you . Where are you going ? All right let 's get this over with . It 's not your fight ... it 's mine . I noticed these within the last few miles . Belladonna . Beautiful lady . So called because Italian women used to apply it to their eyes . Dilated pupils were considered attractive . Let 's hear it for the good old days . So we crush the berries ... and feed the juice to our friend . And then what ? Then we pray . I do not want to kill you . Well that makes two of us . Then sell me your woman . I 'm not his woman ! Ned , please stop . Stand aside you might get hurt . Ned ! Stop it ! Both of you stop it now ! Keep him cool . It 's a fine line between curing him and killing him . He 's purging the blood is fighting the poison . Oh my god is he ? What now ? We won 't know for a few hours ... 'till he wakes . You mean if he wakes . Ned ! Niko ! Please ... nobody dies for me . Veronica , what the hell are you doing ? Ending this . Put down the knife . You can fight over my corpse . Veronica please , don 't . Will you stop ? This is a trick . She will not do it . Goodbye , Ned . Why ? ... why is my life anymore valuable that yours ? You would do it . Yes . Deny the prophecy , deny our hearts . It was just a dream . These are yours . You may leave my life Veronica , but you will never leave my dreams . Safe journey Niko . Be worthy of her . Let 's get this straight ... I 'm not his , I 'm not yours . We were crazy . We were desperate . What right did we have to gamble with his life ? The Roxton we knew was dead . The thing that he turned into would have killed us and gone on killing . At least we gave him a chance . Roxton ! The fever 's broken . Thank God . I think he 's going to be all right . Welcome back . Oh my god , what have you done ? He 's disoriented ... it 's probably the side effects of the poison . Easy ... easy , easy . Take it easy old man ... we 've gotta get you back to the balloon . No , not yet . You know for someone who was just brought back from the living dead you don 't seem very happy . I could hear the wind ... as it crested the mountains a hundred miles away . I could feel ... the tiny heartbeat of a bird on the wing . And when I looked at the stars ... - forget it . - No go on ... please . Well , suddenly ... I knew all the answers . I could see the plan of it all I ... belonged . I was home ... do you have any idea ... what that feels like ? Challenger , wait ! I 'll go alone . You sure ? It 's better this way . Do you think he knows what it 's doing ? Calista ! Calista ! You 've left me ... I can feel it . - Feeding on human flesh . - We are so much more than human come back to me . I can 't . When have you ever felt ... more alive more powerful ... more at peace ? Calista my friends can help you ... cure you of the infection like they cured me . I am pure life ... all you are now is ... a slow death ... but not for long . I don 't want to kill you . You won 't . Calista ... It doesn 't have to be this way . I 'm afraid it does but at least I 'll have you to feed on one last time . You may fool them but you can 't fool yourself . You know I was right . Right where we left it . We 'll camp overnight and leave first thing in the morning . - Marguerite would you light the fire . - All right . Roxton can you give a hand with the balloon ? Look at him does he seem different to you ? Not anymore ... now he just seems like the rest of us . He 'll be fine . I wish I had your confidence . That 's one thing Roxton understands is how to survive . is how to survive . *

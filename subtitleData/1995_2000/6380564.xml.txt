 So , junior prom , eh ? It 's held in the gymnasium ? Yeah . It 's gonna be great . Mm-hmm . That sounds really romantic . You know , I spend 5 days a week there having hulking football players yank my underpants up my crack . Tommy , listen to me . I 've always dreamed of going to my prom . I 've been looking forward to it for years . So if you ruin it for me , I 'll yank your underpants up your crack . This is a side of you that I like . Hey , hon , what are you looking at ? Oh , my god ! You 're going to your prom ? Yeah . What 's wrong ? Well , it 's just- - see , I never got to go to my prom . It was supposed to be the most beautiful night of my life . Just me and Freddy steckel . Like in your tattoo ? But something terrible happened that night . Freddy never made it to my house . As he was getting into his car in his driveway , his wife caught him and made him come back inside . That 's sad . I still have my pretty prom dress in my closet . Sure , now it 's old ... faded ... stained with my tears . Do you wanna see it ? Ok , sure . Well , wait a second . What about me ? Oh , great . I guess I just have to stand here and twiddle my- - incoming message from the big giant head . Dick , Sally ! It 's the big giant head ! The big giant head has evaluated your mission , and you have been issued a score based on the color scale of the visible light spectrum . What ? Your mission has been adjudged orange . Hey , that 's great ! Orange is very bad . On a scale of 1 to 10 , it 's , like , a 2 . Oh ! Damn ! To reevaluate your mission , the big giant head is on his way to earth . He will arrive tomorrow between the earth hours of 9 A.M. And 3 : 30 P.M. Someone from the mission must be home during this time . Transmission ending in 3 , 2 , 1- - ah-choo ! the big giant head is coming here ? Why ? To tear us 4 new ones . But we just got these . He 's gonna yell . There will be lots of yelling , and then the hitting . How dare he ? He 's never even been to this planet . He has no idea how hard it is to be a human . Wait . " Be a human " ? My god , you guys . Maybe that 's our problem . We 've become too damn human ! What are you talking about , Sally ? You see ? " Sally . " You used to call me " lieutenant . " Well , we 've adapted ! We 're emulating an earth family . Earth families don 't refer to each other by rank . They use more familiar terms , like " you " and " bastard . " And " you bastard . " Thanks to you guys , our mission might be canceled . Us ? ! Well , what about you ? You separated yourself from the mission by moving into your own apartment ! Huh . Ok . Well , how about the fact that you decided to father a baby with Vicki despite the distinct possibility it might explode out of her stomach and eat the doctor 's face off ? If there were any tentacles , it would show up in the sonogram . Will you two stop fighting ? You have both taken unacceptable risks . Lieutenant , I order you to move back in with us . Harry , you will not father an earth baby . What am I supposed to tell Vicki ? Just deal with it ! I 'm the high commander . That 's final . Yeah , well , if I were a high commander , I 'd turn a hose on you and Albright . Well , you 're not . Besides , I 'm sure once the big giant head meets Mary , he will find her to be a suitable use of my time . What 's the look ? Oh , good . Mary , here you are . Listen . An old friend of mine is coming to town . Great guy , really great , and I 'm really hoping he 'll like you . Don 't you mean you 're hoping I 'll like him ? Yeah , that 's what I meant . Who is this guy ? He 's an old college friend . Now , when he gets here , you 're not gonna start talking explicitly about our sex life , are you ? Of course not . Well , that 's the thing . You see , I 'm kinda gonna need you to . Try to bring up how great I am and also mention how much I 've learned . You want me to talk about our sex life so you can impress an old college chum ? Yes . And don 't be afraid to embellish . Every time you 're about to describe something , multiply it by 2 first . Dick , why are you so insecure ? You 're fine in bed . Ok . Multiply it by 2 . You 're great in bed . Multiply by 4 . You are a stallion . The merest touch of your hand ignites an unquenchable inferno in my loins . Yes , 4 ! 4 ! Do it ! Could I just hear 5 ? No ! Ok . 4 ! 4 is good . Hey , Doug . What 's the deal with these things ? They 're pickled eggs . Can I ? That 's pretty good . Uh , Doug . You gotta help me out with something , Ok ? When I ask if I can take off early , you just say , " no , you gotta stay late and purge the soda valves , " Ok ? Ok . Hi , Harry . Hi , Vicki . Egg ? Baby , come on . You know I 've already got an egg . Oh , right ! You mean ... say , Doug . Mind if I knock off a little early tonight ? Sorry , Harry . I need you to purge the soda valves . But come on , Doug . Can 't you see we got plans ? Sorry , Harry . I need you to purge the soda valves . What , you 're forcing me to stay ? Yeah . Well , thanks a lot , you son of a bitch ! Oh , boy ! Just because you 're so unhappy in your life , you gotta make other people feel bad ? Oh , yeah ! Walk away ! Walk away ! ♪ We 've got tonight ♪ ♪ who needs to know ? ♪ ♪ We 've got tonight- - ♪ that 's it . Just sway to the music . Hey , stop it ! Well , excuse me for trying to simulate an actual prom-type situation ! I just need help with the dancing part , Ok ? Let 's just do it again . Ok , but this time you be Alissa . Ok . Wait . Why am I being Alissa ? Because I 'm tired of being Alissa . Yeah , but at the prom , I 'm gonna be Tommy . Don 't worry about it . What are you doing ? ! I 'm just trying to prepare you . Tommy might try that . I would not try that . Yes , you would . Yeah , I would . I wish I were dancing with Vicki right now . But thanks to the big giant stupid head , I can 't . [ Crying ] Oh , it 's Ok . Hey , I 'll be Vicki . Sorry . Shh , shh , shh . Shh , shh , shh . I 'll come back . We 're just practicing for the prom . Oh , the prom . One of the most grueling nights of the year for us boys in blue . How come ? How come ? Prom night has all the ingredients of a tragedy . Take a couple of teenagers , throw in a bottle of scotch lifted from daddy 's liquor cabinet , stir in a dash of loud music , and you 've got a deadly cocktail . I thought that was a long island iced tea . Do those have teenagers in them ? No . Then it isn 't ! Hi , Don . How are ya doin ' ? I just need to talk to Tommy and Harry for a second . Why is there a nonessential human in this house ? It 's just Don . Officerdon . Use your heads . There 's an officer of earth law in our headquarters ! [ Telephone ringing ] Don : it 's the phone . Yeah , oh great . Be a dear and get it , would you , Don ? Thanks . Bye now . Ok , listen . Any minute now , that door could open and in could walk the big giant head ! The big giant head ? The big giant head is here ? ! No ! No ! Ok . Call me when he gets here . That was the airline . Airline ? Yeah , you 're expecting somebody ? Well , they wound up in east Rutherford , new jersey , instead of Rutherford , Ohio . [ Squeals ] Anyway , he 's on a flight here now . To the airport ! Let 's go ! Do you see him yet ? See who ? We have no idea what kind of body he formed into . This is so frustrating . He could be any of these people . So his head will be smaller ? Yes , his head 'll be smaller . Dick , what are you doing ? You can 't be too careful . I love you people ! I love your airplane . I love to fly . Does it show ? Look at this loser . Hello ! Is this any way to greet your supreme leader ? Welcome , o great and glorious leader , whose presence in which we , your humble and insignificant subordinates are barely worthy of basking . Right . This is some body I picked out . Pretty good , eh ? Nice abs . So , how was your trip , sir ? Horrifying , at first . I looked out the window , and I saw something on the wing of the plane . The same thing happened to me ! Anyway , to calm me down , they gave me something called ... alcohol . We never would have known . Let 's get on a flight to jersey and get another round . No , no , you don 't have to , sir . That bar over there serves alcohol . Hot diggity ! I love this planet already . How long are we gonna stand like this ? Until he wakes up and sees the respect we 're giving him , soldier . Well , I hope it 's soon , 'cause my deodorant 's crapping out on me . Oh ... my ... god ! What the hell happened ? [ All shouting ] Good morning , sir ! Ha ! Who 's that pounding on my head ? I will find him and destroy him . It 's a limitation of these primitive bodies , sir . It comes from too much alcohol . Well , it 's a design flaw ! Fix it immediately ! Yes , sir ! Hello , hello , hello . Who 's this ? Hi . I 'm Mamie Dubcek . We met last night . You were out in the bushes , and Sally was holding your head . Yes , I ordered her to do that . I chased away the cat . I got you a mint . The yelling will cease , or the killing will commence ! Ah , I thought there 'd be a hangover in the house today . Here you go . A little hair of the dog . Has this got , uh , some of that alcohol ? Well , it 's a bloody Mary . Ah-um ! It 's going to be a golden day . Mrs. Dubcek , this is my old friend ... stone . Stone Phillips . Like that guy on dateline ? No . Can I have another ? Yes . I 'll be right back . Good . I think , sir , that you will find our mission to be in- - whoa ! These feel good . Those would be your legs , sir . How nimble they are . Yes , sir . Now if I could direct your attention to the living quarters- - oh , that was fun ! Yes , sir , very good . I also ... admire your footwork , sir . Oh , that is so much fun ! Come on , everybody , join in . Sir ! With all due respect , I feel it is- - lieutenant ! When you talk to me , straighten up . May I commend you on the form you 've taken ? Thank you , sir ! Dick ? Sir ! My stomach is making that noise again . Get me something to fill it . Yes , sir ! Right away , sir ! Sir , I have some ideas on how to increase the efficiency of the mission if you 'd like to hear them . What I 'd like to hear is how you get around on those long earth legs of yours . Excellent work . Excellent , excellent . I appreciate that , sir . Would you like to kick me with them ? Uh ... no , thank you , sir ! Perhaps later ? Fine ! Sir ! You two ! You 're going to bathe me . [ Both weakly ] Yes , sir . I call washing the top half . Screw that . What the hell have you been doing here all this time ? Well , I 've been working a lot on my relationship with Mary . For 3 and a half years ? ! Establishing an emotional bond with a human is a huge accomplishment . Most humans can 't even achieve it . Really ? Dick , that 's extremely underwhelming . If you only understood how much I 've actually achieved- - oh , I try to understand , and I 've been sending you a lot of messages , but you have got no answer ! Dick , why is this door locked ? ! Oh ! Oh , good . It 's Mary ! You 'll see . She accepts and trusts me completely . Why the hell did you lock the door ? Are you going through my stuff again ? I love you , too , Mary . Could you come over here ? I 'd like you to meet my old friend stone . It 's a pleasure to meet you . I don 't like you . Excuse me ? Let 's go . I want something else to taste . Is there such a thing as macaroni ? Did he just say he didn 't like me ? Yes , but you just don 't understand his crazy sense of humor . He 's a nut . Why don 't the three of us go out , have some macaroni and alcohol , and you can get to know Mary better . If I have to . But who 's this delicious mocha number ? Excuse me ? I love the round part at the top of the legs . Oh , yeah ? Well , what do you think of my hand ? These are fun , too ! Ok . Let 's get going ! Par-Tay ! Orange you glad I didn 't say banana ? I don 't get it . Mary can explain it to you . I--I ... Harry , I 'm gonna need 3 more tequila sunrises and a couple of more knock-Knock jokes . Dick , listen . You have got to calm down . Calm down ? Do you want him to banish us into space in one of those big flat mirror things like in superman ii ? Dick , that 's not real . It looked real . So , stone ... quite a little lady I got here , huh ? I see no glaring defects . Well , I do have this crooked earlobe . Oh , my god . That 's disgusting . I was joking ! Now it 's all I can see ! Dick ? Ooh ! Now look what you 've done ! The man is a jackass ! Why do you want to impress him ? I 'm not trying to impress him . Look , we 'll get you a nice floppy hat for that . Yeah , when you do , give me a call ! Mary ! But , Mary ! Hello , there . May I join you ? Have a seat . These are mine . Get our own . Hi , Harry . There you are . Oh , hi , Vicki . Harry , is something wrong ? It feels like you 've been avoiding me . Oh , no . Harry ! Harry Solomon , do you or do you not wanna be the father of my baby ? Look , Vicki , it 's just a really big responsibility , and I feel like I have to think about my career first . Baby , you do not have a career ! And yet you expect me to provide for a baby . Oh , what , are you gonna have a career ? Yeah ! Ok , now that 's just hurtful . You know that I 'm not designed to live in your 9-to-5 world . Oh , baby . The world is such a mess , what with the craziness in Texas and ... Africa ... Canadians and their whole thing . Let 's just give it a week , see if things clear up . Harry Solomon ... I do not even know you ! [ All singing ] Get me some drinks . Yes , sir ! Hey , Dick . Rough night here tonight , huh ? Why would you say that ? Well , there 've been some complaints . Public urination , verbal harassment , lewdness ... and more public urination . It could be anybody here , Don . Well , I 'm kinda bettin' it 's that guy . Kick ! Kick ! Higher ! As though your life depended on it ! Higher ! Go ! Uh , Don , I 'd like you to meet my old friend stone . Friend , huh ? Well , listen , friend , Rutherford is a clean town , and it 's shenanigans such as yours that are gonna dash our hopes of landing the 20-aught-8 summer Olympics ! Would you lean a little closer ? Your breath smells of chili fries . Can 't you just give stone a little break ? It 's kind of important to me . That 's a no-can-do , Dick . The law 's the law , and it bends for no man . Please , Don . For old time 's sake ? It sure would mean a whole bunch to me . Sally ! Ok . But tell him to stop whizzing in front of the lady folk . Ok . It 's my pet peeve . I know , sweetie . I will . Thanks . Thanks , Don . Hello . Well , hi , there . I 'm a rocket man , you know . Really ? Can I help you jettison your pants ? I kill you ! Sally : hey ! No one violates the big giant- - area around stone without going through me first . Is that understood ? Yeah , Ok . Lieutenant , well done . Thank you . I like the cut of your jib . Well , I 've been working on my jib . Dick disappoints me . I find him ... disappointing . I 'm issuing a big giant directive . Lieutenant , you are now officially the new high commander of this mission . Oh , my god . A toast ! A toast ! A toast to my new high commander . All : to your new high commander ! Huh ? !

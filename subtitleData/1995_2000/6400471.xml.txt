 I 'll see if I can find some medication for Rygel . Hey , little guy . Aeryn , check this out . One critter , two-part harmony . Trelkez . Don 't get it , then . Too few heads . They come with more ? Yeah . The more heads , the better value they are . Their brains are the tastiest part . Yeah , right . Like you 'd cook this guy and eat his brains . Cook ? Never . Raw . No , Rygel I haven 't found you any medicine yet . Hurry up . I 'm very sick . I 'm dying . You only have a touch of Klendian flu . It 's not fatal . We only wish it were . I 'm suffering here . Your pardon ? I sell jikset root , among other interesting things . Then you 're a gift from the Goddess . Hey , you with the big feet ! Now do you want a hand with your problem ? Help 's right here and his name is Haloth . Thanks , pal , but I think my problems are a little out of your league . Oh , incorrect . Haloth can fix up your crummy life , John Crichton . How do you know my name ? Ha . I know lots of things . First , you 're dying to get home to Earth . Second , there 's a Peacekeeper cruiser hunting you . Third , you 're not interested , are you ? Oh , well . Sorry to bother you . Ho-ho-hold it ! This is a scam , right ? Right ? You must have heard Zhaan or D 'argo telling somebody all this , right ? How could I have overheard this ? Your mother 's maiden name is McDougall . You skipped third grade . And you lost your virginity to Karen Shaw in the back of a minivan . No . It wasn 't a minivan . It was a four-by . John , John , you 're grabbing at straws . Look , what 's wrong with listening to the pitch ? You don 't like the product , you don 't have to buy it . Last chance , Johnny-O . You want to meet Haloth , walk this way . If not ... hit the bricks . My name is Haloth . Welcome to my home . How did I get here ? Oh , the words I need elude translation 's grasp . Suffice to say , I simply wished you here . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut ... A radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole ... Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship , a living ship , full of strange alien life-forms ... Help me ... Listen , please . Is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander doing everything I can ... I 'm just looking for a way home . Oh , dried gavork ! Oh , quite aromatic . Oh , I 've never seen such quality . I 'm honored to be complimented by a Delvian Pa 'u . Twelfth Level , are you ? Only ninth , I 'm afraid . Ninth is impressive enough . What 's this ? Trellon oil . Careful with that . Toxic ? Quite the contrary . It 's a sensual stimulant . Enriches the conjugal experience . You can vouch for this personally ? Yes , though it was some time ago . It 's still potent . Nonetheless , I suggest you test it before you buy . Alone ? As you choose . But I 'm willing to stand by my products . Let me see what else you have to offer . Okay , you brought me here . What else can you do ? Alas , I cannot transport you back to Earth or act as guide or compass to that end . You can 't send me home and you can 't even point me in the right direction . You are a fugitive pursued by Crais , who bears a dark desire for revenge , although you did not seek his brother 's death . Captain Crais , all the marauders have reported in . They 're low on fuel , sir . They must return . The marauders will launch the moment they 're refueled . Captain , the marauders have been on continuous patrol . The pilots are so fatigued that it would be dangerous to launch ... It 's far more dangerous for a Peacekeeper unable or unwilling to do his duties . Do you understand ? Yes , sir . Captain , priority communication from High Command . In my chamber , Lieutenant . How , how did you ... ? Never mind . How , however you know ... you 're right . But it was an accident . If I could only tell Crais that , make him understand . Oh , that knowledge would dispel his vengeful thirst . My talents can provide you with the means . I can talk to Crais ? You can set that up ? I 'll summon the powers for this task . Hey , wait , I got a couple of questions ... Couple of thousand more questions . Captain Crais , you are to cease your pursuit of the escaped leviathan transport . Withdraw from the Uncharted Territories at once and return to First Command for new orders . The Council awaits a full explanation of your failure . The Admiral wanted you to hear this in case I refused . He 'd expect me to take over command in that event . And would you ? My first loyalty is to my captain . And mine is to the Council . But perhaps I can negotiate for more time . Is there any other record of this transmission ? No . Dismissed . My name is Haloth . Welcome to my home . What is this place ? Where 's my ship ? ! Your swift and mighty vessel is undisturbed , traversing territories yet unmapped . Return me at once or die ! I 'll not , for first , I 'll have you hear my words . Before you vainly try and do me harm , behold this glimpse of one whose death you 've sworn . Crichton . What are you ? A friend , who 'll give you Crichton , for a price . What price ? Tell me ! Where 's Crichton ? He keeps wandering off . He 's over this way . I can smell him . Wait . You can smell Crichton in all of this ? Yes . His odor is even stronger than yours . I don 't have an odor . Crichton ! Is he alive ? Get Zhaan . Now ! Oh , dear . Oh , dear ! Friend Crichton , I have news that you will not like . No luck , huh ? You couldn 't find Crais ? Actually , I found him quite easily . Crais . No obvious injuries . Could he have been poisoned ? Who on this planet would want to harm him ? Well , someone has . This one says that she saw Crichton entering the dwelling . He was alone , I swear . You 're lying to me . You saw him with someone , didn 't you ? No ! It was Maldis , wasn 't it ? Who is Maldis ? He 's not really here . He 's a ... he 's a hologram , right ? I am here , Crichton . To talk . To kill you . Hey ... Just put that thing down . I 'm .. I 'm not going to fight you . Why are you doing this ? We had a deal ! My services have found a better price . I 'm playing for bigger stakes now , John . You can still talk to Crais . Just don 't expect him to listen ! This cut wasn 't here before . Look at this . Your companion is as good as dead . And so are the rest of you . Is he contagious ? It 's not a disease that 's done this . It 's something much worse . A dark and dangerous force . Wielded by an evil sorcerer whose name is Maldis . He feeds upon pain and death . Gaining strength by tapping into the life energy of others . Maldis invaded our planet and killed half our population . We who survive are prisoners kept alive only at Maldis 's whim . So this entire planet is subjugated by one man . Not a man . A cruel and malevolent being who 's learned how to transcend corporeal form . If you all rose against him ... We 'd all die . I know how invincible Maldis is . Before he came , I was a high priest . You were ? I fought back but my spiritual powers weren 't strong enough . It amuses Maldis to keep me alive in poverty . He especially likes fresh victims . The rest of you will soon follow . Not if we leave this planet first . You can 't escape Maldis 's grasp . Even in space , hundreds , thousands of metras away , he can get at you . And do what ? This . He can rip your spirit from your body . How can we fight against that ? We can fight . Where is this Maldis ? He 's taken over the complex at the end of the bazaar . None of us go near it . Well , he 's done very well to terrorize primitive people . Let 's go back to Moya get some weapons and see how he does against a pair of soldiers . He 'll find you soon , you know . What the hell are you doing ? He wants to kill me . No , really ? Fathom that . Oh , by the way . My name is Maldis . But you can address me as Haloth if you like . I got a lot of names , John-boy . Call me whatever pops your cork . Yeah . Right . You 're a regular Laurence Olivier . Why are you doing this ? What did he offer you ? Much bigger stakes than you can and the bidding 's closed . Here you are . Here he is . Now deal with it . - Damn it . Looks dead to me . Don 't start , Rygel . Why did you bring him here ? For safekeeping . Someone needs to tend to him if he starts to bleed again . Shouldn 't Zhaan do that ? She says that she is busy . She 's helping by applying some Delvian mysticism to the situation . Well , it doesn 't help my situation , does it ? Or have you forgotten how sick I am ? This should help . It is ointment of yuvo . It 'll help clear your breathing passages . D 'argo , let 's get those weapons . Yuck , it smells like trat . There is nothing to be done . As soon as Maldis is finished with your companion he will come after the rest of you . We must fight him . I 've already told you . I 'm no match for him . But what if you and I combine our powers ? You cultivated your power to help others . Can you use it as a weapon ? I can try , if you guide me . Can you be guided ? It 's not just a matter of skill . It 's intent . You must want to do harm , cause pain , even kill . You are a ninth level Pa 'u . You simply aren 't capable of that . I once was . There are no exits . Save your energy for fighting Crais . I 'm not playing your sick game . Maybe you 're not , but he is . Murderer ! Listen to me . I didn 't murder your brother . You destroyed his Prowler . Excellent , Crais , now finish him off . It was an accident . Too slow . You missed your chance . Your first lesson , inflicting pain . Go on . Hurt the beast . If you can 't inflict pain , you 'll have no chance against Maldis . How can you be so sure that Maldis will come after the rest of us ? Because you 're new , alive and vital . Not beaten and depleted like this planet 's population . Feeding upon all of you will increase his power unless you and I stop him . More . More . I can 't . You must . You 're right , I was once capable of cruelty , but now I have evolved past that . Evolved ? Try repressed . You 've choked off all your real emotions . That 's not true . You think you 've smothered your inner fire and found enlightenment . But all you 've done is make yourself cold . Look at you ! Struggling to contain what you 're feeling . Fighting to keep control . What is it you 're so afraid of ? I 'm not afraid . Come on . You 're terrified . I am a Delvian Pa 'u . Nothing can frighten me if I do not wish it . You can 't wish your fear away . Face it . Admit what it is you 're scared of . Are you afraid of Maldis ? You can destroy him . That 's what terrifies me . Oh , mama ! Sebaceans don 't care much for heat , do you ? Crais , lay off for a minute and listen to me . Why ? So you can beg for your life ? So I can tell you why your brother died . Tell me then . Tell me why he died . First , you tell me something . My module , the one I was piloting . How does it compare with your Prowlers ? Primitive , no weapons , no defense shield . A windup toy , right ? Yet my species is so primitive we all live on one planet . I was orbiting it when a wormhole sucked me onto your turf . I didn 't intend it and I 'd go home in a second if I could . I believe you 'd say anything to save your life . It 's the truth . You think I attacked your brother ? Oh , yeah , I popped into the middle of a giant space battle and decided to go one-on-one with a total stranger in a far superior ship . Does that make any sense ? You rammed his Prowler . He ran into me . You killed him . It was an accident . Why do you keep blaming me ? I did everything I could to avoid him . Most eloquent , Crichton . Almost sounded sincere . It was sincere , you son of a ... But futile . Let me spread some light on Crais 's hostility . Father ? How dare you bring this man here ! Don 't worry , Crais . I wouldn 't touch your father . This is simply an image from your past . Bialar ! Tauvo . Come here , please . That 's right . Bialar Crais , the acorn , and the mighty oak . Maldis ! Remove these images ! It 's time , sons . The recruiter is here to pick you up . Stay close to Tauvo . Give him guidance . I 'm counting on you to protect him . Do you understand ? Bialar ! Is that real ? You didn 't choose to be a Peacekeeper ? You and your brother were shanghaied from your home . Enough . We were selected for Peacekeeper training . It is a great honor . Yes , wasn 't it ? Just imagine how proud your father would be if he knew that his sons both rose from the ranks . Officer Tauvo Crais reporting . It 's an honor to be on board , sir . Captain 's bars suit you , my brother . No ! Maldis ! Why are you doing this to him ? Just to jog his memory a bit . Of course his brother 's current appearance is more like this . And Crichton did that to him ! Stop this . You know what I think , John ? You can talk till your tongue falls out . He 's going to kill you , regardless . Right , let 's do it . This door is protected by an evil spell . There 's no such thing . Then why can we not get through ? Zhaan , the door will not open . We cannot get inside . Even if you could , Maldis in his incorporeal form cannot be hurt by weapons like those . Then what can hurt him ? I can . Oh , well , then , after you . What are you waiting for ? A third choice . Though , I know there are only two . Let that evil flourish , or unleash another evil against it . How would you choose ? I suppose I would choose the lesser evil . Well then , there 's no reason to delay , is there ? Maldis is that way . But we cannot get through that door . Well , we 'll keep trying . Crais ! You can 't run forever . I can wait . Enjoying yourself , Crais ? Maldis sure is . He wants us to fight . You ever wonder why ? I don 't care why . He 's feeding off us . He 's drawing energy . Notice how jazzed up he gets every time we go at it and how tired he looks when we don 't ? That 's why he showed you your brother . Crais ... he 's pushing your buttons . Maldis ... doesn 't command me ! Don 't fool yourself , buddy . Maldis is your enemy here , not me . It won 't work . Nothing can stop me from killing you . Look , just listen . Please , listen . You 're beating yourself up because you were supposed to protect your brother . I understand that now . And you can believe this or you can shine it , but honest to God , I tried to get clear . I didn 't mean for him to crash , and I 'm sorry he 's dead . You understand that ? It doesn 't matter . Doesn 't matter ? It changes nothing . Tauvo is dead . Struck down by a weak , pathetic , inferior being . It must be avenged ! I swear in Tauvo 's name , Crichton , you will die in my hands . Crais , wait ! You 're not nearly as thick as I thought , John . You begin to understand what I 'm all about . Yeah . You 're a vampire . I admit it . I feed on death . But don 't we all ? Some eat plants , some , meat . I consume the life essence itself . Preferably medium rare . So why not just kill us ? Why all the foreplay ? Death is the main course . All this is the appetizer . Crais is coming . Will you run or fight ? I 'm getting hungry again . Breaks my heart . I apologize for my behavior . Continue . Zhaan , where are you ? This goo you sent up is worthless . What are you going to do about it ? Wait . This is a better lesson . Zhaan ? Zhaan ? Give pain to Rygel ? Zhaan , did you hear me ? I demand you bring me something that works . But he 's aboard Moya . I cannot reach that far . You can with my help . Why don 't you answer me ? What are you doing down there ? Can you find me a remedy or not ? And if not , why are we still here ? We should leave this useless planet immediately and find a place where I can get some relief from this cursed ... Part of me enjoyed that . We 're nearly ready . The captain is incapacitated . You must remove him and assume command . Not while there 's a chance of reviving him . If you want official authorization I 'll contact High Command ... There will be no communication outside this ship unless I expressly order it ! Dismissed . We 're not giving up . How can we fight a battle when the enemy 's defenses cannot even be breached ? We will breach them even if I have to blast this door down . Actually , that might work . If I overload this pulse rifle then the resulting explosion should be enough to take out this entire wall . It won 't work . It might work . Can 't have that . What happened ? I don 't know . Captain Bialar Crais ? Let 's say you do kill me . What happens then ? Think Maldis hands you a trophy and zaps you off to your ship ? What 's to stop you from bringing your Command Carrier back to the planet and toasting the whole place ? Think he 's going to risk that ? Come on , Crais . He may not even let you kill me . He may drag this thing out for years and then kill us himself . Is your vengeance satisfied if Maldis kills me ? No . Come on , Crais . Who 's your big enemy , me or Maldis ? Can you put your revenge on hold and start thinking like a Peacekeeper ? What do you propose , Crichton ? A truce . We join forces and nail Maldis . We can 't even lay hands on him . His power can 't be infinite . He 's got to have some weakness . If we both stay calm and unemotional , he can 't recharge . We can starve him out . Come on , Crais . This may be our best chance . I agree . A truce . My oath as a Peacekeeper . Good . Truce it is . Now first question is , how much power ... What 's the matter with you , Crichton ? Are all the species on your planet this dim ? It 's kill or be killed . - I don 't know why I 'm bothering . - I don 't care what Aeryn thinks . You certainly look dead to me . I don 't know your customs for these situations . Not that I care . So I 'll give you the Hynerian Ceremony of Passage and be done with it . " John Crichton , valued friend . " Now wait a minute , " valued friend " is a bit of a stretch . " John Crichton , unwelcome shipmate . " Hmm . " may you have safe transport to the hallowed realm . " Hmm ... Actually , not our hallowed realm . No , that 's for Hynerians . Go find your own hallowed realm . With the Ceremony of Passage complete , I declare you officially dead , and claim all your possessions for myself . Now ... I 'd say you dislocated that . Happened to you once before , didn 't it ? When you trashed your motorcycle , and the only way for you to get home ... was to pop it in yourself . Pretty gutsy . So why do you keep playing hide-and-seek with Crais ? Take him on ! What 's the matter , Maldis ? Blood sugar level getting low ? Need another hit of violence to kick up the old energy level ? Yes . I 'm getting tired of appetizers . It 's time to dine . What , is that supposed to motivate me ? No . But maybe this will . Only one of you has to die . Oh , yeah . And what 's the other one get ? A free trip to Bermuda ? Well , back to your ship anyway . Believe me , I give you my word . Like that 's worth anything . It 's better that Crais 's , I assure you . Crais is an animal . I thought I could reason with him . You can 't . It 's him or you . Shh . Shut up . I 've had enough of both of you . Well , you want gladiators , fine . You got ' em . Tell Crais that I 'm waiting for him . So you 're done talking to him ? Yeah ! All done . When we reach Maldis , you must not hold back . Strike with all our combined strength . No hesitation . No weakness . No mercy . The good captain is here . I 'll leave you to it . Where 's Crais ? I had him . I returned him to his ship . Bring him back ! I had him ! Yes , you did . Took you long enough . But you finally did what I wanted . What you wanted ? ! I thought you were hungry . You wanted death . I do . But I 'm planning for the long term . Bigger stakes , remember ? It 's not you or Crais I 'm interested in , it 's that glorious death machine of his . Just think what I could do with a Peacekeeper Command Carrier . Carnage on a truly massive scale . You ... you want him to keep pursuing me , so if he brings his ship within reach ... Absolutely . He was seriously thinking of taking it home . Can you believe that ? But now he 'll never turn back . Deeper and deeper into Uncharted Territory he 'll go . And sooner or later , that ship will be mine . And then ... Damn you ! Temper , temper . By the way , John ... I was telling the truth . One of you has returned to his ship . And now , the other has to die . Die . John ! I 've broken through . I 've made him tangible . He 's all yours now . Rygel ! What the hell are you ... what ? Where am I ? You ... you died down on the planet . D - D 'argo and A-Aeryn brought your corpse up here . And I , I revived you . Oh , yes , the others ... yeah , they wanted to set your body adrift . Uh ... but-but I insisted I could save your life . And I did . Course you did . Oh , it 's not Kansas . And you 're way too homely to be Auntie Em , but come here , Toto . Liko . I gave you all I ... had . You 're dying . Let me help you . You already have . Maldis is gone . The price was worth paying . I only regret ... that you and I ... I do not need further examination . I 'm fully recovered . Doctor , you will omit this entire incident from your medical log . Your utter failure to diagnose and treat my affliction will go unreported and unpunished . You 're dismissed . Has there been any communication with High Command ? Uh , no , sir . Lieutenant Orn wanted to get their authorization to terminate you , sir , but I overruled him . Then no one outside this chamber knows of the Admiral 's orders . I saw to that , sir . Lieutenant Orn . Status report . All marauders report negative , sir . Then widen the search to dekka three . Take us deeper into the Uncharted Territories . Yes , sir . Crichton , I will find you again . Zhaan ... Crichton told us that you two killed Maldis . Even in his semi-corporeal form , Maldis could not be killed . But he could be dispersed . He will coalesce someday . Zhaan ... I feel I must apologize to you for mocking your courage . I see now that you are more of a warrior than I ever thought . What is the matter with her ? You called her a warrior . You could not have cut her more deeply . I just don 't know , D.K. Maybe it was always a stupid thought , but I ... I just figured if could sit Crais down and talk to him , I could convince him I wasn 't the murderer he thinks I am . Well , I had my chance . And I 'm never going to get another one . And he 's going to keep at it till one of us dies . Zhaan . Well , you look about as cheerful as I do . Come on , talk to me . What 's up ? John , before I became a priest , I ... I was a savage . Yeah , I think ... I remember you saying that . I don 't know that I ever believed it . You 've never seen that part of me . I thought I 'd eradicated it , forever . Well , you resurrected it once , to deal with Maldis , so it 's over . No , it 's not . I feel it inside me still . Now I have to rid myself of it again , and I don 't know if I can do it , John . Well , is there anything I can do to help ? Aw , come on , there must be something . I mean , even if it 's just being a good listener . No one can help me . I 'm ... I 'm sorry .

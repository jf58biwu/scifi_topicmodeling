 Voyager to Shuttlecraft Drake . Prepare for emergency transport . Mr. Kim , can you hear me ? We 're attempting to lock on to you . Harry ? Harry . Hey , it 's time to wake up . What 's wrong ? Libby ... Yes ? This can 't be happening . What 's wrong with you ? Libby , it 's really you , isn 't it ? Come on . You 're going to be late . What ? You have a meeting ... 0900 , remember ? You 've only been obsessing about it for a week . I don 't want Lieutenant Lasca blaming me because you weren 't on time for the biggest meeting of your career . Now , get dressed and I 'll make you some breakfast . Come on . The eggs are getting cold . What 's with you today ? The date . What 's the date ? The date ? What day is today ? 4901 1 . So this isn 't the past , it 's the present . San Francisco . This can 't be a dream . It 's too ... real . It 's too clear . So what does that leave ? A holodeck ? A hallucination ? Some kind of trick ? The last thing I remember was piloting a shuttlecraft on my way back to Voyager . We both have a long day ahead of us . Could we play this little game another time , please ? No ... you can 't be Libby . It 's not possible . My name is Ensign Harry Kim of the Federation Starship Voyager . Where am I ? Is this some sort of simulation ? That 's not funny , Harry , talking about Voyager like that . The memorial service was only two months ago . Danny was your best friend . How could you joke about it ? Danny ... Danny Byrd ? I 'm done with this conversation . Go to work . I 'll see you tonight . What is going on ? Harry ! Coming right up . Here you go . Vulcan mocha , extra sweet . Thanks . So , today 's the big day , huh ? What do you mean ? You know , the meeting . The new ship you 're designing . And don 't forget , you promised to bring me a model ... and I 'm going to hang it right there in my window , and I 'll tell everyone : " Harry Kim , he designed that ship . He came into my shop every morning . " Look , I know this is going to sound a little funny , but how long have I been coming to this coffee shop ? How long ? Well , let 's see . Since you left the Academy . How long is that ? Eight ... eight months . - Eight months ? - Mm-hmm . And you 've seen me every day ? Well ... not every day . You like to sleep late on Sunday . But if I had your fiancée , I 'd sleep late , too . Fiancée ? ! We 're getting married ? Ah , yes . There were many mornings I woke up , I said the same thing to myself when I was about to be married . But don 't worry , it 'll pass . I don 't think you 've ever had a morning quite like this one . Hey , Harry ! You ready to go ? Um ... where ? Very funny . Come on . We better get moving if we 're going to catch the transport to Headquarters . I ... I 'm not sure I can go . I 'm not feeling very well . Maybe I should just go home . Come on , come on . It 's just a case of the jitters . You 'll do just fine . Relax , Harry . If all goes well , you 'll walk out of this room a Lieutenant . Let me see that warp coil schematic . The what ? The coil diagram ... the one with the new plasma flow equations . I forgot to bring it . Forgot ? Harry , we need that diagram to show that we 've worked out the dilithium fracture problem . I 'm sorry . Well , we 'll just have to improvise . Good morning . I have a meeting at 1 100 hours with the head of Starfleet Security . She doesn 't like to be kept waiting . Let 's get this underway . Lieutenant Lasca ? Thank you , Admiral . Ladies and gentlemen , you are looking at the new Runabout Yellowstone . It 's equipped with tetryon plasma warp nacelles and designed for a variety of mission profiles . Yes , Lieutenant , I 've looked over your specifications . It 's an interesting design ... but how do you propose to address the dilithium fracture problem ? Tetryon plasma tends to disrupt subspace . I 'm actually glad you asked that question , sir . We 've been working on the problem for several weeks , and I think you 'll see that we have found an answer . I 'd like to introduce you to the engineer who designed these new warp engines . And , I might add , he is the most promising young engineer to come out of the Academy in a long time . Ensign Harry Kim . Harry . Is there a problem , Ensign ? Actually , sir , there is . Come on , Harry , pull it together . We 've been waiting for this for six months . Ensign , are you ill ? Yes , sir . I 'm very ill . I would like to ... continue this presentation at a later date . Well , unfortunately , Ensign , I 'm leaving for a three-week tour of the Cardassian border in a few days . It will have to wait until after then . Harry ... you better be dying . Guess I 'm pretty good . Computer , display my service record . " Graduated Starfleet Academy , Stardate 47918 . " Requested duty on USS Voyager . " Request ... denied . " Requested transfer to Starfleet Engineering Corps . " Transfer approved . " Starship Design Specialist . " Awarded the Cochrane Medal of Excellence for outstanding advances in warp theory . " Computer ... access Starfleet Science Academy database . Have there been any temporal anomalies in the space-time continuum reported in the last 48 hours ? Negative . No temporal anomalies have been reported . Computer ... has there been any contact with the Starship Voyager since it was lost in the Badlands ? Information on USS Voyager is classified . Security clearance level three or above is required to access files . No problem . It 's my ship , or at least I thought it was . Security authorization accepted . Last recorded contact with USS Voyager prior to its disappearance was on Stardate 48307.5 . Access Voyager crew manifest . Who was the Operations Officer on board ? Ensign Daniel Byrd . Danny . Harry ! What are you doing back so early ? Oh ... hi . I wasn 't feeling too well , so I decided to come home . Oh ? You don 't look sick to me . Coming home for a little visit with Libby , are we ? Ah , to be young . Don 't worry . I 'll keep your secret . Thanks . Listen , I know this is going to sound strange , but I forgot to look at the street number when I left this morning and I don 't remember which building I live in . Could you ... Tell you where you live ? You 're not playing some kind of a prank on your old pal Cosimo , are you ? No . Like I said ... I haven 't been feeling well and ... everything 's kind of foggy . Okay , okay , okay . Well , you live right over there ... fourth floor , apartment 4-G . Thanks . Harry ... don 't look so concerned . Everything 's going to work out . You have a wonderful job , a beautiful fiancée . Everything is going to be fine . Trust me . Hmm ? Hello ? Who 's there ? It 's just me , Libby . Harry ? Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . You feel a little warm . God , you 're tense . Why don 't you tell me what happened today . Nothing . Everything . I 'm not sure what happened . Harry ... forget about work . Try to relax . You 're home now . What can I do to help ? Just ... tell me you love me . I tell you that every day . Aren 't you getting sick of hearing it ? No . In fact pretend I haven 't heard you say it in a long time . Pretend that we haven 't seen each other for months . Okay . I love you , Harry . Welcome home . So ... if we haven 't seen each other for months ... where have you been ? Oh ... on a starship , thousands of light years away . A mission ? Yeah . We got a little lost . Aw . Sounds lonely . You can 't imagine . Tell me something ... Hmm ? You didn 't stop at Risa along the way , did you ? No ... no pleasure planet excursions , I 'm afraid . You thought about me the whole time . Every day . Every nanosecond . Do me a favor . Hmm ? Don 't ever leave me again . " Orlando , Parsons , Peterson , Platt , Porter ... " Wait a minute ... Paris . Where 's Tom Paris ? Computer , access service record of Starfleet officer Thomas Eugene Paris . " Convicted of treason . " Sentenced to 18 months " at the New Zealand penal settlement . " Paroled on Stardate 48702 . Last reported whereabouts : Marseilles , France . " Harry ? It 's 4 : 00 in the morning . What are you doing ? Oh , I couldn 't sleep , so I thought I 'd catch up on some work . When are you going to tell me what 's going on ? There 's nothing going on , okay ? You 're not a very good liar , Harry . You 've been acting strange all day and I 'm not the only one who 's worried about you . Lieutenant Lasca called this afternoon . He said he 's never seen you so agitated . So don 't tell me there 's nothing going on . Libby ... it 's hard to explain right now , and I do want to tell you , but I need you to trust me . I do trust you . I love you . That 's why I 'm marrying you . I would hope you would have the same trust in me . All right . This ... this is going to sound a little crazy from your perspective , but I am not who you think I am . Oh ? All of this ... it 's not supposed to be happening . I don 't belong here . If you 're having second thoughts about getting married , why didn 't you just say so ? You don 't understand . What I 'm trying to say is ... I 'm from another reality . Another reality . That 's right . Harry , you 're starting to scare me . I know . I 'm scared , too . Maybe you should talk to a Counselor , a neurologist . There may be something wrong with you . I will . But there 's someone else I need to see first . Where are you going ? Marseilles , France . What for ? I 've got to see Paris . But you just said ... you were going to Marseilles . It 's a long story . Trust me . Okay ? Okay . Hey , watch it , will you ? I 'm trying to set up a shot here . Tom . Who the hell are you ? You don 't know me , do you ? Sure . We were at the Academy together , right ? No . Oh . Well , it must have been the Exeter . We served on the Exeter together ? Try Voyager . Ah ... Voyager . Well , sorry to disappoint you , but I never set foot on that ship . And I can 't say that I 'm sorry , considering what happened to it . You know about the mission to the Badlands ? Oh , yeah . Captain Janeway asked if I 'd help her track down that Maquis ship in exchange for an early release from the penal colony . But you said no ? Are you kidding ? I said yes . Sounded better than Starfleet Rehab . Anyway , I got as far as Deep Space Nine , where I got into a bar fight with a Ferengi and I was thrown into the brig by a very unpleasant shape-shifter . Janeway tried to get me released , but my parole was revoked by Starfleet Command . Voyager left without me . That Ferengi , was he trying to sell you Lobi crystals ? Yeah . How do you know about that ? Because I was there ... in my reality anyway . Tom , I know this is going to sound crazy , but I was on Voyager , and so were you . You never got into a bar fight with that Ferengi . You stopped him from selling me Lobi crystals , and you did lead us into the Badlands . You 're right . That does sound crazy . Something 's happened . Somehow , reality has been changed ... a temporal anomaly , an alien influence ... I can 't explain how . All I know is that it 's true . I was in a shuttlecraft , heading back to Voyager and then ... I woke up here , on Earth . What is it you want ? Come with me to Starfleet Headquarters . Help me run a computer simulation of what happened on that shuttle . You 're the best pilot I 've ever seen , and if anyone can figure it out , it 's you . God ... you ... you had me there for a minute . You really did , but then you blew it . What are you talking about ? You 're not getting me to set foot inside Starfleet Headquarters . So you tell whatever Admiral or Captain who sent you that I 'm not interested in being another pawn in one of their games . It 's not a game ! Oh , it isn 't ? Oh , that 's a shame . I like games . You once told me that you used to treat life like one big game : rules , players ... winners , losers . You never took any of it seriously , until you lost . You know , you 're starting to annoy me . You also told me you were afraid of what would happen to you if you didn 't take Captain Janeway up on her offer . Now I see why . What do you see ... Ensign ? A loser ... and a drunk . I guess , in this reality , that 's all you 'll ever be . What 's going on ? Harry , just relax . Why does everyone say " relax " when they 're about to do something terrible ? Starfleet knows what you 've been doing . Which is what , exactly ? Breaking into classified files , using forged security access codes . I haven 't forged anything . And I can explain . That 's why we 're here . We 're going to take you back to Starfleet Headquarters . They want to ask you a few questions . Harry , please ... just go with them . Tell them what you told me . Everything will be all right . I don 't think I have a choice at the moment . I 'll see you later . You claim to have Voyager security protocols because you were an officer on Voyager . Yes , sir . Lost in the Delta Quadrant . Yes , sir . And Ensign Daniel Byrd ... you say that he 's taken your place on that ship ? Yes , sir . And this is all because ... reality has been changed somehow ? Yes , sir . But you don 't have a single shred of evidence to back up your claims . Harry ... I don 't doubt for a minute that you believe you 're telling the truth , but we have to consider all the possibilities . Like what ? Like you could be delusional , or you could 've had your memory centers altered , so that you think what you 're saying is the truth , or you could be an alien masquerading as Harry Kim . That 's crazy . I am Harry Kim . Check my DNA if you don 't believe me . Run a microcellular scan of my cerebral cortex to see if my memory 's been altered . Everything I 'm saying is true . Mr. Kim , why did you travel to Marseilles , France , this morning ? I ... went to look up an old friend . You have poor taste in friends . Thomas Paris is a convicted traitor and a Maquis sympathizer . Now , what did you talk about with him ? I tried to tell him what 's happened . I wanted his help . His help ... to run a shuttle simulation . Why ? To figure out how I got here , and how I can get back . There must be a temporal anomaly somewhere , or ... You think I 'm a spy , don 't you ? You think I 'm working for the Maquis . We 're here to find the truth , Ensign , whatever that might be . That 's it . I 'm not answering any more questions until I have legal counsel . You have that right . Harry , we want to help you , but try to understand . What you are telling us doesn 't make much sense . All we know , so far , is that you have been seen talking with a Maquis criminal and you 've broken into classified Starfleet records . Until there is something else ... something concrete ... those are the facts in this case , and you have to admit the facts look pretty bad . We will be monitoring your movements until further notice . I believe you know the restrictions ... no off-world travel ... and if you tamper with the anklet , Security will be immediately alerted , and you will be formally charged . Do you understand ? Yes , Admiral . We 'll be spending a lot of time together , Ensign , and I assure you , we will get to the bottom of this . You 're dismissed . Troubles , Harry ? You could say that . Let 's have some coffee . I was sent here to watch you ... to make sure that you were all right . But now it 's clear that you are not . Who are you ? We exist in what you would call a temporal inversion fold in the space-time matrix . It 's not necessary to understand . It only matters that there was an accident . Your shuttle intersected one of our time-streams and ... boom ! A few things were altered as the result of the accident . History and events were scrambled a bit and you ended up here . Well , you 've got to get me back . Ah ... we don 't know how . What ? We only know that an accident occurred . We don 't know how or why . Well , that 's not good enough . There 's got to be something we can do . Where is this time-stream of yours ? Maybe I can use it to get back . Mm ... the time-stream weaves through the galaxy like a thread . I could show you how to find it , and you could try to recreate the conditions that existed before the accident and fly back into it , but there 's no guarantee what will happen to you if you do . What do you mean ? Well , you may be able to change reality again , but there 's no way to predict how it would change . You could end up at any point in the space-time continuum . You might return to your original reality , or you might find yourself a billion years in the future , or at some time before sentient life even existed on your planet . I guess I 'll have to take that chance because somehow I have to get back . Are you so sure ? This is a pretty good place for you , Harry . You have a wonderful job with Starfleet , a beautiful woman who loves you . Why be so quick to turn your back on all this ? Maybe this is your , uh ... fate ? Isn 't that the word your people use ? That thing which was meant to be ? Hmm ? Seems to me you 're actually a very lucky man . What about Danny Byrd ? He isn 't so lucky . And Tom Paris ? Fate wasn 't so kind to him . No . It isn 't supposed to be this way . I 'm supposed to be on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant , and that 's where I have to go . Very well . This will tell you where the time-stream intersects this region of space . That 's as much as I can do for you . Thanks . Good luck , Harry Kim of Voyager . You 're going to need it . Unless , of course , you decide to stay . In which case , I 'll see you in the morning , same time ... Vulcan mocha , extra sweet . Libby ... I didn 't hear you come in . Obviously . You 're in enough trouble as it is . What do you want them to do , put you in prison ? No ... I 'm just trying to get back to where I belong . Where you belong . You used to say you belonged here with me . But I guess everything 's changed , hasn 't it ? Look ... I know the last few days must 've been pretty tough on you ... Do you ? ! Do you really know what it 's like when the person you love suddenly changes ? It 's still me ... the guy who was in your seat at the Ktarian music festival . The guy who took three weeks to work up the courage to ask you out . The guy who still wakes up in the middle of the night and says your name out loud , hoping you 'll answer back . But if you 're really Harry , you wouldn 't be trying so hard to get away from me . I 'm not trying to get away from you . I love you . And I promise you I want to stay here more than anything . But I can 't . I don 't understand . I don 't understand any of this . I don 't think anybody knows me as well as you do . So you , of all people , should know that once I 've made up my mind about something , I can 't let it go . In some ways ... it 'd be a lot easier to forget about Voyager , just settle in here and build a life ... but that wouldn 't be me . You wouldn 't be getting the Harry Kim you fell in love with . Does that make any sense ? The tampering alarm . Security will be here any second . I better go . I promise you , I 'm going to try to get back . It may take awhile , and I may not make it , but I swear I will try . Sorry . Hold it ! Get up ! Excuse me . There goes my bank shot . What are you doing here ? Helping out a friend . Let 's go . So how did you find me ? I still have a few friends at Starfleet . They told me you were in some serious trouble . Yeah . Starfleet thinks I 'm a Maquis spy . I know the feeling . Those security anklets really chafe , don 't they ? You 're the last person I expected to help me . Let 's just say it 's been a long time since anybody gave a damn about my future , including me . I don 't know if I 'm supposed to be on Voyager like you 've told me , but it sounds a whole lot better than the life I have here . I 'm willing to take my chances , Ensign . Call me Harry . You always did . Won 't be long before they find us . We better keep moving . Wait , I found a way to get back to my reality . The problem is I 'll need a ship to do it . I think I have access to a runabout , but I 'm going to have to break it out of Spacedock . Sounds to me like you need a pilot . Know anyone who 's qualified ? I know someone who used to be pretty good , and if I 'm not mistaken , he still knows a few tricks . I have an office at Starfleet Headquarters . I think we can access the runabout launch codes from there . Site-to-site transporter . With friends like mine , you never know when it 'll come in handy . Where 's your office ? Main complex , Level 6 , Subsection 47 . I can beam us in , but we 'll only have a few minutes before Security starts kicking down the door . Let 's do it . So , Harry , once we 're on board the runabout , what 's the plan ? The alien said that if I recreate the conditions of the accident and fly into the time-stream , there 's a chance I might be able to get back into my reality . Might ? He couldn 't give me any guarantees . Security 's just been alerted to an unauthorized transport in the building . It 'll take them another 20 seconds to track it to this office . How are you coming ? Almost there . I 've bypassed the runabout security lock-outs . They 're onto us . We 've got to go . Hold on . I 've almost got it . Now ! Overriding initialization codes . Main power coming on line . Let 's get those engines going . Powering up main fusion reactor . Intruder alert . Unauthorized launch in progress . The space door is closing . Warp core and main propulsion are on line . Releasing docking clamps , moorings cleared . Here we go . We 're clear . I 'm entering the coordinates of the time-stream into the main computer . Adjusting course to match . Going to full impulse . We 've got a starship on our tail ... Nebula-class . I 'll try to lose them , Harry , but they 're a lot faster than we are . Attention Runabout Yellowstone . Power down your engines or we will open fire . They 're going to try to do everything they can to stop us . They think we 're trying to steal this prototype . They 're closing to 5,000 kilometers . Shields down to 70 percent ! 50 percent ! 29 percent ! I thought you said this ship was new and improved ! It is . But it looks like they haven 't finished working on the defensive systems . In fact , some of the safety interlocks aren 't even in place . A few more of those hits and I don 't ... We 're losing antimatter containment . Attempting to stabilize the field . We 're approaching the coordinates of the time-stream . The containment field is weakening . We could be looking at a core breach . The ship 's closing to 3,000 kilometers . If we can 't shake them off , maybe we can slow them down a little . This runabout is equipped with tetryon plasma warp nacelles . So ? Tetryon plasma emits multiflux gamma radiation . It disrupts subspace . We could vent the warp plasma . The second they hit the plasma cloud , their engines would stall , give us a few seconds of breathing room . Exactly . Unlocking the warp drive manifold . Venting drive plasma . Any second ... They 've dropped to one-tenth impulse . Our containment field 's at critical . We 'd better hurry . All right , let 's recreate my shuttle accident . I think I was traveling at 140,000 kph . You think ? Look , that was another lifetime . I 'm doing the best I can . Increasing speed to 140,000 kph . Now , I also remember running a polaron scan . The scanning beam was sweeping at a radius of half a million kilometers . No , wait ... a quarter million . Activating polaron scan . That should do it . Approaching coordinates . Impact in four ... three ... two ... Did we miss it ? We passed through the coordinates , but the runabout was unaffected . The starship has repowered its engines . They 'll be here in under a minute . I have to get into that time-stream . Wait a minute . I 'm forgetting something . The emergency transport . The last thing I remember hearing was Captain Janeway 's com voice . She said she was trying to beam me off the shuttle . That 's it . I 've got to beam off the ship . Are you crazy ? We have to recreate all the conditions of the accident , including that one . We just lost antimatter containment . 25 seconds to core breach . I 've locked onto the time-stream . Get on the transporter pad . Not yet . The core 's breaching . We 've got to shut it down first . There 's no time ! That ship 'll be here in another 30 seconds ! In 15 seconds , this ship is going to explode . You 'll be killed . Look ! If you 're right , then things will be changed back to the way they 're supposed to be , and you 'll find me back on Voyager . And if I 'm wrong , if this doesn 't work , you 'll be blown up right here . Go ! Voyager to Shuttlecraft Drake . Prepare for emergency transport . Mr. Kim , can you hear me ? We 're attempting to lock onto you . Harry ? Kim here , Captain . Harry , we need you to drop your shields . Stand by . Shields down , Captain . Lieutenant . The anomaly is sending out heavy subspace distortions . I can 't get a positive lock on him . The hull is starting to buckle under the stress . He won 't survive much longer . Tuvok , can you boost the transporter signal ? Negative . The signal is at maximum gain . Ten seconds to hull breach . He 's just out of reach . B 'Elanna , can you tie the transporter directly into the main deflector dish . Use it to extend the signal . I 'll try . Hull breach in progress . We 've got him , Captain . Mr. Chakotay , analyze the sensor logs . I want to know what happened out there . Aye , Captain . Voyager to Transporter Room 2 . Are you all right , Mr. Kim ? I think so , Captain . Is Lieutenant Paris there ? Yes , he 's here . Why ? It 's a long story . I look forward to hearing it . I 'll be in my ready room . We think your shuttlecraft was caught in some kind of temporal anomaly . A time-stream ? Yes , you could call it that . I 've already been briefed , Commander . Welcome back . Kind of a rough ride , huh ? What is it , Harry ? I owe you one .

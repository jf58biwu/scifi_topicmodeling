 Cleaned , corrected re-synced by Tronar Good afternoon , Ensign . How are we doing today ? We 're doing just fine , thank you . Good , good . By the way , I was wondering if you 'd take a look at the thermal array in the kitchen . It overloaded this morning and vaporized an entire pot roast . I 'd be happy to . Wonderful . My ! I informed Ensign Kim about the problem hours ago and he still hasn 't come down to fix it . He 's been working on a problem with the structural integrity grid . I 'm sure he hasn 't forgotten about you . If this thing doesn 't get fixed soon , we 'll all be eating cold leftovers for dinner , and who do you think the crew will blame ? Mm . Looks like you need a new set of anodyne relays . I 'll go down to Engineering and get some for you out of storage . Thanks . Oh , and while you 're here , would you mind taking a look at the replicator ? It 's been having trouble making anything with large amounts of cellulose . Of course . Cabbage , psyllium , green beans , celery , it all comes out looking a touch too yellow . I thought you didn 't use replicated vegetables when you 're cooking . Always fresh , organic , from the airponic bay ? Uh , well , the yields have been a little low lately . Normally , I would never dream of using synthesized veggies . It looks like a malfunction in the power grid . Shouldn 't be too difficult ... What 's wrong ? I think I 'm having a contraction . Oh , yeah , it 's a contraction , all right . Well , that 's wonderful . Labor can 't be far behind . Let 's ... let 's get you to Sick Bay . Try to breathe , now ... deep , deep regular breaths . Not so fast now . We 're having a baby ! - That 's good . - Hmm . Push ! Don 't forget to breathe , Samantha . Deep regular breaths . That 's it . Cervical dilation is at 10.2 centimeters . Prostaglandin levels are normal . Push , Ensign ! You push , damn it ! I 'm sick of pushing ! I know you 're fatigued . Try to focus on your breathing . Remember the exercises we did . When you feel a contraction , bear down . This is ridiculous . It 's been seven hours . How long does it take to deliver a baby ? As long as it takes , Mr. Paris . Indeed . During the birth of our third child , my wife was in labor for 96 hours . Four days ? I have learned that pregnancy and patience go hand-in-hand . You know , I didn 't expect to be this nervous . It 's not even my child . In a way , this child belongs to all of us . It is the first baby born on Voyager . I 'm just not sure whether I should be welcoming it on board or apologizing . Captain ? Voyager isn 't exactly anyone 's idea of a nursery , and the Delta Quadrant isn 't much of a playground . My father had a saying , Captain : " Home is wherever you happen to be . " Captain , long-range sensors are picking up heavy subspace communications ahead . They 're Vidiian . All stop . A ship ? At least 20 ships within sensor range . I am also detecting a G-type star system with two inhabited planets . Life signs ... Vidiian . Sounds like we 're headed right into their territory . And I 'm in no mood to donate any organs today . Options , Mr. Paris . There 's a large plasma drift , bearing 40 mark 7 . It extends almost half the length of this sector . Interference from the plasma should block us from their sensors . Good thinking . Lay in a course at full impulse . Mr. Tuvok , deflectors at maximum . Oh ! Oh , what was that ? ! What 's wrong ? A pain ... in my abdomen . It 's different ... sharp . Oh , God ! The baby has shifted position and its exocranial ridges have lodged in the uterine wall . This is a rare complication , but it 's been known to happen in human-Ktarian pregnancies . Can we reposition the baby ? No , its spinal column is too fragile . I don 't want to risk nerve damage . If we don 't deliver the baby now , its ridges could perforate the uterus and cause internal bleeding . Kes , prepare for a fetal transport . We 're clearing the Vidiian system , Captain . Take us out of the plasma drift and resume our previous course . I 've locked onto the baby 's coordinates . We 're ready to begin . Initiating umbilical separation . Energizing . Congratulations , Ensign . It 's a girl . Is she all right ? The transport caused a slight hemocythemic imbalance , but we 'll stabilize her cell membranes with osmotic pressure therapy . What was that ? We hit some kind of subspace turbulence as we were coming out of the plasma drift . I can 't tell if ... What the hell ? Captain , the warp engines just stalled . Go to impulse . Impulse engines aren 't responding . Maneuvering thrusters are out , too . We 're losing main power . Switching to backup power . Red Alert . Bridge to Engineering . Report . Our antimatter supply is being drained , Captain . I don 't know why . The containment fields are in place . It 's like we sprung a leak , but I can 't find the crack . B 'Elanna , try infusing the warp core with repeated proton bursts . That should be enough to keep it going . I think I can generate enough protons in the sensor array for a burst every 30 seconds . Do it . Hogan , these proton bursts are going to cause a lot of stress on the hull . Reinforce structural integrity to ... Now what ? What was that ? It appeared to be a proton burst . Already ? Bridge to Torres , report . Engineering , respond . Captain , three EPS conduits just ruptured in Engineering . They took heavy casualties . The incubator is losing power . Activate the auxiliary respirator . We 've got wounded here ! Second-degree plasma burns on the face and neck . Treat him with the dermaline gel . Fractured clavicle , thoracic contusions . Nothing serious , she can wait . Fused vertebrae , prep him for surgery . Status . It doesn 't look good , Doctor . The baby 's cell membranes won 't stabilize . Increase the osmotic ... That 's not helping . Increase the osmotic pressure ratio by ten percent . Bridge to Sick Bay . There 's been a major coolant leak in the Mess Hall . You 've got more wounded on the way . Acknowledged . Torres to Bridge ! We 're definitely being ... We 're definitely being hit by proton bursts , but I don 't know where they 're coming from . I never even started the procedure . She 's right ; the main sensor array is off-line . Not a single burst was fired . And yet the bursts appear to be originating from within the ship . It 's like they 're coming out of thin air . Captain , these bursts are weakening the structural integrity of the hull . We cannot take any more . Can we increase power to structural reinforcement ? Our antimatter supply is too low . There 's just not enough power to go ... Hull breach on Deck 15 , Section 29-Alpha . Emergency force fields are off-line . Captain , I 've been working on a way to enhance our portable force field generators . It might be enough to seal that breach . Go . Don 't you worry . We have the best doctor in the Quadrant . Doctor , her cell membranes are losing cohesion . Try remodulating the osmotic pressure . No effect . Hang on , I 'll be right there . Oh , no . Jefferies tube 12 runs right over the breach . If we can get close enough , we should be able to set up a portable containment field . The breach has weakened the integrity of that tube by 22 percent . That 's why we need to reinforce the field . We 'll use the power conduits on this deck . I 've analyzed the bursts on all spectral frequencies . There 's still no indication of where they 're coming from . At this point , I don 't give a damn where they 're coming from . I just want to stop them . Chakotay , do we have enough auxiliary power to magnetize the hull ? It might cushion the impact of the bursts . We have just barely enough . Give it a try . I 've stabilized my imaging array , but it could go out at any time . Doctor ... Prepare for emergency resuscitation . My baby , she ... she 's going to die , isn 't she ? Not if I can help it . Here it is . The breach is directly below us . Make it fast , Harry . Torres to Hogan . What 's your status ? Almost got it , Lieutenant . I 'm rerouting all power in this section to your ... Torres to Hogan . Hogan , are you there ? I 'm hurt . Hurry . We have to help him . Just give me a minute . Again ! Nothing . I 'm sorry , Ensign . Hogan to Sick Bay . I need ... medical assistance ... Deck 15 , Section 29 . I 'll go . The breach is widening . Let 's get out of here . Damn it , Harry , let 's go ! Hold on . My minute isn 't up yet ... ! Harry ! Grab my hand ! Harry ! Lieutenant Hogan ! Kes ! Over here ! Torres to Bridge . Ensign Kim is dead . Kes just disappeared . Disappeared ? ! I can 't explain it . She just vanished . There seems to be some kind of spatial rift right where she disappeared . Can you determine where it leads ? Stand by , Bridge . I just threw a piece of conduit into the rift . Just as it vanished , I detected another oxygen / nitrogen atmosphere . Another atmosphere ? Whatever 's on the other side of that rift there 's air ... maybe Kes is still alive . Get out of there , Torres . The hull breach is widening . I 'm going to evacuate the entire deck . You don 't have to tell me twice . The main computer core is failing . Switching to backup processors . Chakotay , are you ready to magnetize the hull ? Stand by . I 'm having trouble with the alignment module . Try remodulating the field emitter . Chakotay . I 've got alignment . Magnetizing the hull . I think it worked . Let 's hope so . I want a full damage report from all decks . Are you all right , Captain ? It 's just a scratch . It 's more than a scratch . Maybe you should go ... I 'm fine , Lieutenant . Damage reports are coming in . The hull breach on Deck 15 has widened to include Deck 14 , Section 12 . And there are 632 micro-fractures along the hull 's infrastructure . All primary systems are off-line . We are running on emergency power only . The antimatter supply has dropped to 18 percent and is continuing to fall . Warp coils in both nacelles have fused and are inoperative . The environmental control systems are failing . 15 crew members have been seriously wounded with plasma burns . 27 experienced other injuries . The Doctor is setting up triage facilities in Sick Bay and Holodeck 2 . I must also regretfully report that Ensign Wildman 's baby did not survive . I want an Engineering team to seal those micro-fractures before they become breaches . Aye , Captain . Mr. Paris , grab a medical tricorder and go assist the Doctor . Right . Commander , you have the Bridge . I 'm going to go talk to Ensign Wildman . Maybe I can help ... The magnetic field is collapsing ! The hull is depolarizing ! The fire suppression system is out . Warning . Hull breach on Deck 1 . Emergency force fields inoperative . Everybody out ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Hurry , Captain ! I 'm trying to reroute emergency power to the field emitters ! Captain ! I can seal this breach ! Captain , let 's go ! Captain ? Ensign Kim , scan the Bridge . I just saw myself cross the Bridge and enter that turbolift . It was very faint ... almost like a ghost image ... and I looked like hell . Captain , there was a minor spatial fluctuation on the Bridge , but it was only there for a millisecond . Bridge to Engineering . B 'Elanna , how long until we can use the main sensor array ? Another three hours . We 're only about halfway through the proton burst procedure . See if you can speed up the process . We need the sensors as soon as possible . Understood . Mr. Kim , modify a tricorder to scan for spatial anomalies . Go over every centimeter of this Bridge . Examine the sensor logs from our trip through the plasma drift . Look for anything unusual . I 'll be in Sick Bay . Aye , Captain . Good news , Ensign . Our baby is perfectly healthy . There 's no sign of any inter-species abnormalities . " Our " baby . A figure of speech . I am , in part , responsible for bringing her into the world . You may hold her now . Hello , there . Congratulations , Samantha . She 's adorable . Have you thought of a name ? Not yet . I really thought it would be a boy . Let me know as soon as you decide . I 've been making a blanket for her . All that 's missing is an initial . Get some rest . How 's our other patient doing ? She 's still unconscious . I ran a microcellular scan . We 're almost identical in every way . Almost ? There 's a slight phase shift in their DNA . Do you have any theory about where she came from ? Not yet , but I intend to find out . Can you wake her ? I believe so . Good ... because I think she 's going to have an interesting story to tell . I was running through the corridor with my medkit ... Deck 15 ... and then , suddenly , I felt dizzy and my vision started to blur . After that , I don 't remember anything until you woke me up just now . You were found unconscious down on Deck 15 holding a medkit . We also found this lying next to you . It 's a piece of damaged conduit . Our analysis shows it 's from Voyager , Deck 15 , Section 29-Alpha , Bulkhead 052 ... but there 's no damage to Deck 15 or anywhere else on this ship . There was massive damage to Deck 15 . The evidence would seem to suggest that you 've come from a different ship ... a different Voyager . We did find a spatial rift on Deck 15 . It 's possible that it somehow connects us to this other Voyager . If you 're right , where is the other ship ? A parallel universe ? Another dimension ? Another point in time ? I 'm not sure . Almost everything about the Voyager Kes described is identical to ours . We 've had similar experiences , similar personal histories . We both entered a plasma cloud to avoid the Vidiians . Both of our engines stalled as we left the cloud , which caused both of our antimatter supplies to drain and then we both decided to keep our engines running by emitting proton bursts ... but after that , our experiences diverged . We started emitting the proton bursts . They didn 't . Our ship was being damaged by proton bursts . We couldn 't figure out where they were coming from . That 's more than a coincidence . Janeway to Engineering . B 'Elanna , I want you to stop the proton bursts immediately . But if we stop now , the power levels will drop ... I 'll explain later , Lieutenant . Understood . I don 't know how ... but there 's another Voyager out there and I intend to find it . We analyzed the sensor logs from our trip through the plasma cloud . We couldn 't find anything unusual until we ran a quantum-level analysis . Remember that subspace turbulence we hit just before we left the cloud ? Yes . Well , watch what happens . At first , we thought it was a sensor aberration , but they were in perfect calibration at the time . So I ran a multispectral analysis on the subspace turbulence . It was more than just turbulence . It was some kind of divergence field . And the moment we passed through it , all of our sensor readings doubled . Mass , energy output , bio-signatures ... everything . Every particle of matter on the ship seems to have been duplicated in that instant . So where 's the other ship ? As strange as it sounds , Captain , according to these readings , another Voyager is right here , right now , occupying the same point in space-time that we are . Quantum theorists at Kent State University ran an experiment in which a single particle of matter was duplicated using the divergence of subspace fields ... a spatial scission . If the same forces were at work inside the plasma cloud , they may have duplicated every particle of matter on Voyager . Matter ... but not antimatter . Captain ? In that Kent State experiment , they were able to duplicate normal matter , but when they tried to duplicate antimatter particles , the experiment failed . So the antimatter on the ships wasn 't duplicated . Both engines have been trying to draw power from a single source of antimatter . Like Siamese twins linked at the chest , with only one heart . So what do we do ? I don 't know , but whatever it is , we 're going to have to coordinate it with the other ship . Start working on a way to communicate with them . Right . The only link we know of is on Deck 15 ... the spatial rift . We 're going to need a way to send Kes back through safely . We could rig a portable phase discriminator . It might protect her from the spatial transition . Get on it . When can I start breast feeding ? Right away . However , I should forewarn you that her incisors will erupt within three to four weeks . Since your skin lacks the scales of a Ktarian , we 'll have to discuss alternatives . When can I take her home ? In 24 hours . I want to observe the infant to make sure there 's no more damage to her cell membranes . You 're welcome to stay the night so you may be with her . I 'd like that . Hey ... what 's the matter ? Congratulations , Ensign ... it 's a girl . I 've stabilized my imaging array , but it could go out at any time . Doctor , her cell membranes are losing cohesion . Try remodulating the osmotic pressure . No effect . Again . Nothing . My baby , she 's going to die , isn 't she ? I 'm sorry , Ensign . She 's going to die , isn 't she ? Kes ... Kes ? Are you all right ? Yes . It 's just ... the baby 's crying . It was like a bad memory . What do you mean ? On my Voyager , during the delivery , there were complications . We performed a fetal transport . The same thing happened here . The transport was successful . On my ship , the medical systems were heavily damaged . The osmotic pressure therapy didn 't work . The baby died . I 'm sorry to hear that . But try to understand , it wasn 't your fault . The situation was out of your control . Doctor , I 've got to get back to my ship . They need my help . The Captain 's working on it , Kes . In the meantime , try to get some rest . Besides , I 'm sure your Voyager is also equipped with a proficient Emergency Medical Hologram . It 's a little harder to establish a com link than I thought , Captain . The molecular signature of the second Voyager is slightly out of phase with our own . I can 't get visual , audio ... nothing . Have you tried remodulating the com-frequency carrier ? Five times on 47 different frequencies . There has to be a way . If they were recalibrating their carrier wave at the same time ... so we could match phase variants ... would that allow us to connect ? I think so , but , in order to get them to do that , we 'd have to communicate with them first . It 's the chicken and the egg . Maybe we need something a little more primitive . Is there a signal we could emit on all subspace bands just to get their attention ? A rotating band pulse might do it , but it wouldn 't be much more than a shrill whistle . That might be enough . Give it a try . All right , Captain . All of the ship 's command functions have been rerouted to Main Engineering . Welcome to the new Bridge . Now , let 's see about ... What 's that ? I don 't know . It 's some kind of com emissions coming through all subspace bands . Coming from where ? Good question . I can 't tell . But it 's got a Federation signature . Try recalibrating our frequency carrier to match it . That 's it . They recalibrated and locked onto our phase variant . What kind of communication can we establish ? Not much , at this point . We can use the emergency encryption code for a short message . Not more than five seconds . That should be enough . That 's the emergency code . Run it through an alpha-numeric sequencer . I think someone 's telling us to lock onto a frequency of 12 gigahertz . Do it . I 'll try to clear it up . Captain ... this isn 't an illusion . What you 're seeing is real , but it 's going to take some explaining . There are two Voyagers and two crews ? That 's what I was told . Could this possibly be some kind of subterfuge , Captain ? An alien deception ? That woman , whoever she is , had very specific knowledge of what happened here ... the damage from the proton bursts , Wildman 's baby , Kes disappearing . She even knew that when I was 12 years old , I walked home in a thunderstorm over seven kilometers because I lost a tennis match . And her explanation of how the ships were duplicated was certainly plausible . If it is true , what do we do about it ? My ... counterpart has suggested we try to merge the two ships ... recreate the subspace divergence field we passed through and then depolarize it . Both ships would have to send out a massive resonance pulse from their deflector dishes at exactly the same time . They may be able to do that , but we barely have enough power for life support . How can we get enough to send an energy pulse of that size ? We could evacuate all the crew to this deck and cut off life support everywhere else . Then we could divert all power to the deflector dish . B 'Elanna , reestablish the com-link with the other ship . This is Janeway . What have you decided ? Captain , we think we can channel enough energy to our deflector dish to try the merging process . Good . When can we start ? We 'll need at least 15 minutes to make our preparations . We 'll be ready . And , Captain ... we 'll only have enough power to try this once . I understand . Chakotay , Tuvok , begin the evacuation process . Aye , Captain . I 'll let the Doctor know he 'll have to rely on his backup power supply . We 're ready , Captain . We 're standing by , Captain . I think you should take the lead in this operation , since you may have to make allowances for your ship 's weakened power systems . Acknowledged . Lieutenant Torres ... and Lieutenant Torres ... charge the deflector dishes . Deflector dish charging . Capacitance levels are rising . 60 percent ... 85 percent ... 98 percent ... We 're ready to create the subspace divergence field . Initiating . Power flow nominal , Captain . Synchronize computer event timing . Ready to release depolarization pulse on my mark . Now . The pulses have been emitted , Captain . The fields are starting to depolarize ! But we aren 't merging . In fact , we 're going further out of phase ! Increase power to the deflector dish . I can 't ! Too much plasma backflow . If we keep this up , we 're going to lose our antimatter connection ... we 'll both be destroyed ! Abort ! Aborting resonance pulse . What went wrong ? I 'm not sure . I think the plasma flow became too turbulent . The divergence fields were so chaotic , we couldn 't complete the merging . We 've lost the com-link , as well . Captain ... the antimatter leak , it 's becoming a hemorrhage . If we don 't start the proton bursts , we 'll be completely drained in 30 minutes . The lives of both crews are at stake here . I can 't make unilateral decisions that might affect that other ship . Janeway to Kim . Is the spatial rift still stable ? I think so , Captain . And I 've rigged a phase discriminator . Kes should be able to go back safely . Rig another one , Ensign . I 'm going with her . This should protect you from the spatial transition . Keep trying to reestablish a com-link between the ships . I will , but remember we have fewer than 30 minutes of antimatter left . Whatever you do over there , do it fast . Understood . Are you ready ? Yes . It 's gotten worse here . Command control is in Main Engineering . Let 's go . I don 't know how else to stop the antimatter drain except with proton bursts . We can 't do that . We 'd damage the other ship just like this one . Think , people . We need options . I agree , Captain . And I think we need to talk . By my estimates , our antimatter supply will run out in less than half an hour . The attempt to merge our ships is throwing us further out of phase . The quantum cohesion on both Voyagers is breaking down . Just like the original Kent State experiment . The duplicate atoms couldn 't occupy the same point in space-time for very long before ... Mutual annihilation . What are our options ? Let 's try a different tack . Instead of trying to merge the two ships , let 's try to separate them . Maybe we could divide the antimatter between us . I 'm afraid not . We 've been studying that theory . B 'Elanna tells me that any attempt to disrupt the antimatter supply would destroy us all . What about evacuating your crew to my ship ? It might get a little crowded , but we could manage . We 've been studying that theory , and my B 'Elanna tells me that sending any more than five to ten people through the rift would radically alter the atomic balance of the two Voyagers . We 'd both be destroyed . Captain , I think you should return to your ship and run a metallurgical analysis . Find out the precise phase modulation of your hull . I 'll do the same here . Maybe we can find a way to realign the phase displacement . You 're going to self-destruct your ship . What makes you say that ? Because that 's what I would do if your Voyager were intact and my Voyager were crippled , my crew wounded or dead . I 'd sacrifice my ship so that yours could survive . Then I 'm glad we agree . Go back to your ship . I didn 't say I agree . I said I understand . I 'm not willing to let you make that sacrifice yet . We haven 't explored all the options . Yes , we have , and we both know it . This is my ship and my decision . Captain , I 'm not going to let you ... I 've made my decision . Please don 't make me call Security and have you escorted off my ship because ... you know I 'll do it . All right , I 'll go back . But give me 15 minutes to come up with another solution . After that , it 's your decision . 15 minutes . Good luck . To both of us . Okay , I 've managed to reestablish a com-link with the other Voyager . Hail them . Captain , I 've got an idea . Actually , it was yours . It might be possible to realign the phase displacement between us . We don 't have time to try it . My plan is the only one that 's going to work . It 's time that we both accept that . We 've got a perimeter alert . A vessel is approaching , bearing 005 mark 318 . They 've just dropped out of warp . Can you identify them ? They 're Vidiian , sir . Red Alert . Shields . Still off-line . Captain , we 're picking up a Vidiian ship heading this way . Can you see them , too ? Yes . Do you have any weapons ? Stand by . Tuvok ? Negative , Captain . We had to reroute power to compensate for the antimatter loss . It would take several hours to bring weapons back on line . What is it ? Their ship seems to be trapped in some sort of spatial flux . - Have they detected us ? - Yes , but they can 't raise their shields . And it appears that whatever is happening to them has disrupted their weapon systems . Load a hyperthermic charge . Fire . Captain , they have fired an energy weapon . All hands , brace for impact . Damage control teams stand by . What happened ? They couldn 't have missed . Maybe they hit the other Voyager . Hail them . I 've lost the com-link again . Try to get it back . We have destroyed their weapons array . Maneuver us to within grappling range . They are cutting an access route through the hull on Deck 5 . Vulcan , male . Phaser blast damaged the right kidney , but the other organs are healthy . Begin with them . I 've erected an emergency force field around Sick Bay . That should hold them off for awhile . I won 't let them take my baby . It 's going to be all right , Ensign . Give her to me and I 'll hide her inside an access port . If they do break in , it 's unlikely they 'll look for anyone there . Trust me , Ensign . I won 't let anyone touch our baby . Mama will see you soon . Lieutenant , give me a hand . Move this . We 're going to have to cut away the internal circuitry to make room ... Vidiians . They 're using some kind of disruptor to break down the force field . The force field 's down . Commander . They 've got everything below Deck 5 and I don 't know how much longer we can keep them away from the Bridge . Mr. Kim , how many Vidiians are there on the ship ? 347 , and more are boarding . We 're outnumbered two to one . I 've got an incoming subspace signal . It 's from the other Voyager . They must 've reestablished the com-link . On screen . Captain , this com-link might not last much longer . What 's happening over there ? We 've been boarded . The Vidiians are on the verge of taking over our ship . Are they on yours ? No . We don 't think they can detect our ship . Captain , we can have a security detachment cross the spatial rift and board your ship within five minutes . No . If we do that , the Vidiians might become aware of your Voyager . That would put both ships at risk . We can 't just stand by and let you all be killed . I 'm not about to let that happen . I 'll destroy this ship . I don 't suppose there 's any way I can change your mind . I know how stubborn you can be . True . But there is something else I can do for you . I 'm going to send Harry Kim through the rift with Ensign Wildman 's baby . Somehow , it seems only fair . We 'll be waiting for them . Just make me a promise , Kathryn . Get your crew home . I will . I will . Harry , you 've got five minutes . Get the baby . But , Captain ... Move it , Ensign ! That 's an order ! Computer , initiate the self-destruct sequence . Authorization : Janeway-pi-one-one-zero . Set at five minutes and mute voice warnings . Enable . Warning . Self-destruct sequence has been initiated . Warp core overload in four minutes , 55 seconds . There will be no further audio warnings . Ocampa , female . The organs are healthy . She has an extremely high rate of tissue regeneration . Extract her pelvic ridge . We 'll analyze the bone marrow for phage resistance . The others are human . My scans indicate their pancreatic tissues are well-suited for transplant . Begin the extraction procedure . Shh . This one ... a female human . She 's recently given birth . Are you certain ? Yes . Her hemo-uterine levels are far above normal . Where 's the infant ? Set your bio-probe to maximum . Find it . Shh ... shh , shh , shh , shh . No ! Ensign Kim , is that you ? Doc . Am I glad to see you . Have we retaken the ship ? No . Actually , the Captain 's put the ship on self-destruct . She ordered me to take the baby and go to the other Voyager . Well , I guess you 'd better hurry then . Good-bye , Doc . Ensign , tell my counterpart that I 've corrected all signs of hemocythemia . He 'll know what that means . Will do . Hello . I 'm Captain Kathryn Janeway . Welcome to the Bridge . Commander ! It 's about time . Tuvok to Janeway . Ensign Kim has made it through the rift . With the infant . Acknowledged . Captain , the Vidiian ship has been destroyed . So has the other Voyager . Captain 's Log , Stardate 49548.7 . There are no signs of any pursuing Vidiian vessels and we have resumed a course toward home . Repair efforts are underway . Lieutenant Torres estimates we 'll be able to return to the Bridge within three days . Good . I 'm not sure how much longer B 'Elanna can tolerate my standing over her shoulder in Engineering . Hmm . Tuvok , is there something on your mind ? I am curious , Captain . Before the Vidiians attacked , when you were in disagreement with the other Captain about ... Would I have given the order to self-destruct our ship ? I 've gone over that moment a thousand times in my mind . The truth is , yes , I would 've given the order . But I will admit , there was a part of me that could see her point of view . One could say that you were both the doubter and the doubted . I do not envy the paradox of logic you were faced with in that situation . Neither did I. And neither did she . Thank you . Thank you so much . You 're welcome . But you should also thank the Doctor . It was his counterpart who saved her from the Vidiians . I 'm not surprised . I am programmed to be heroic when the need arises . By the way , Ensign , this other Doctor ... did he have a name ? I really didn 't have time to ask . Am I allowed to go back to my temporary Bridge now , Doctor ? By all means . It 's good to have you back , Ensign . Thank you . I think . Something wrong ? I 'm not sure . I mean , this isn 't really my ship . And you 're not really my Captain , and yet , you are , and there 's no difference , but I know there 's a difference . Or is there ? It 's all a little weird . Mr. Kim , we 're Starfleet officers . Weird is part of the job .

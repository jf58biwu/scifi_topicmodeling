 ... rocked northwestern New Mexico this morning . Centered in the desert , the 5.6 temblor ... was felt as far away south as Corona and Roswell . - Where are you going ? - Riding . I 'll be back in a few hours . Eric . Leave the snakes alone today . They 'll be angry ... and afraid . I found something . You better come see . - Robert , come home right now . - Let 's go . What do you think it is ? I don 't know . What did he say ? He said , " It should be returned . They will be coming . " You bitch ! Beautiful ! Yes ? Good . Gentlemen , that was the phone call I never wanted to get . - Check the bedrooms ! - Clear . Clear ! - What are you doing here ? - Can we talk inside ? I 'm not feeling well . I didn 't sleep last night . I 'm really not in the mood for the Three Stooges . I don 't think we 've been followed . Well , who would follow you ? The multinational black ops unit . Code name : Garnet . Trained killers , school of the America 's alumni . You boys been defacing library books again ? They don 't want us . - They want him . - " Kenneth Soona " ? - We think that 's his real name . - You 've heard us refer to him as " The Thinker . " - What did he do ? - Hacked into the Defense Department computer system . - Why ? - The Thinker 's an anarchist and a snoop . Whatever he got into has made him a very wanted man . Customs and Immigration are on full alert . - Every port of Egress is closed . - What are you coming to me for ? In his last communique , The Thinker named a meeting place ... and a three-hour time window . He asked specifically for you . The only problem is he may already be dead . What happened ? She just shot her husband . Married for 30 years . Like she went crazy . Everybody go back to your apartments . We 'll handle this . Excuse me , sir . Calm down . Weirdness . I don 't want you to know my real name . I don 't think it 's that important that you know . Sounds like a line I used in a bar once . I 'm sorry about the wait , but I kind of got this ninja party shading my butt . Why ? What have you got ? If I 'm correct , I got the original Defense Department 's UFO Intelligence files . Everything from the 1940s and up . - Everything ? - Everything ... Roswell , MJ-12 and beyond . - You 've read them ? - Not entirely . I downloaded all I could and then I split . I knew that these guys were gonna be after me . What makes you think they know who you are ? I didn 't take any precautions . I mean , I didn 't even expect to get inside . They 've always denied that these files even existed . What do you want from me ? I want the truth , and I want you to promise that those rat bastards answer to the people . - Mulder , Skinner 's looking for you . - Come in and lock the door . - Why ? What 's going on ? - Are you familiar with the Ten Commandments , Scully ? You want me to recite them ? Just number four ... the one about obeying the Sabbath . The part where God made Heaven and Earth but didn 't bother to tell about His side projects . - What are you talking about ? - The biggest lie of all . - What is this ? - The Holy Grail . The original Defense Department files . Hard evidence that the government ... has known about the existence of extraterrestrials for almost 50 years . - Where did you get this ? - Your friendly neighborhood anarchist . No . I don 't believe this . This is just gibberish . Damn it ! I 'm so sick of this crap ... and B.S. And double-talk ! I can 't believe this . Mulder , this may not be gibberish . It 's a joke , Scully . It 's a bad joke . I think it 's just encrypted and I think I recognize it . It looks like Navajo . It was used during World War II . My father told me it was the only code thejapanese couldn 't break . - I remember the long streams of consonants . - Can you find out ? - Only a handful of people can decipher it . - Then find one of 'em . Mulder . Are you okay ? Yeah . I just haven 't been sleeping . Agent Mulder , I need to speak with you . - About ? - In my office . Why ? Is this another jerk-off assignment where I end up doing the government 's dirty work ? It 's about a rumor that you may be in receipt of some sensitive files . - I don 't know anything about that . - Agent Mulder , listen . I 'm talking to you . Are we finished , Agent Mulder ? Are we done ? We 're done . - You wanted to see me , sir ? - Yes , Agent Scully . Please have a seat . Agent Scully . You heard about the incident here in the hallway yesterday ? Yes , sir . Do you have any explanation as to Agent Mulder 's bizarre behavior ? No , sir . Agent Mulder told me he was having trouble sleeping . Do you think Agent Mulder confides in you , Agent Scully ? - Of course . He 's my partner . - Your partner ? Weren 't you originally assigned to Agent Mulder to debunk his work ? Yes , sir . Ayear and a half ago . I 've been writing regular reports stating the validity ... of Agent Mulder 's work on the X Files . - Would you lie to protect him ? - Am I being accused of lying ? Agent Mulder has been notified of a disciplinary hearing . If there 's something we learn at that meeting that you haven 't stated here today , you could be subject to the same summary action . What action is that ? Dismissal without chance of reinstatement . Is that all , sir ? Yes , Agent Scully . Thank you . Hello , Bill . - What are you doing here ? - I 've come on some pressing business . - We had agreed that you would ... - That was a long time ago . There have been some unforeseen events . No one was supposed to know . Who could have predicted the future , Bill ? That the computers you and I only dreamed of ... would someday be home appliances capable of the most technical espionage . The files should have been destroyed . They should have , but they weren 't . Regret is an inevitable consequence of life . How do you know my son has them ? The man who stole them has come forward . Oh , God . As always , we maintain plausible denial . The files are only as real as their possible authentication . My name is in those files . The files have been encrypted , of course . We have a certain luxury of time . We endeavored to prevent that fact from ... ever coming to light . You wouldn 't ... harm him ? I 've protected him this long , haven 't I ? Your son has been provident in the alliances that he 's created . The last thing we need is a martyr or a crusade . But if he should ... learn of my involvement ? You 're your own man , Bill . You always have been . But I strongly encourage you in that event ... to deny everything . It 's good to see you again , Bill . You look well . You didn 't answer your door . I took a pill . - I couldn 't find you at work . I was worried about you . - I came home . I must be running a fever . Maybe it 's the threat of being burned at the stake . They called me in today . - What did you tell them ? - That nothing was wrong . Well , you told them the truth then . Mulder , you opened the door for them . They 're just looking for a good reason now . Okay . I 'll say I 'm sorry . Mulder , these files , who knows you have them ? - Why ? - Because I had to lie today . And I put my job in jeopardy in order to do so . - If they find out about those files ... - How would they find out ? Maybe they already know . The question is , is it worth it ? Is this cassette worth risking everything ? I 'll tell you when I find out what 's on it ! Now , just tell me who I could talk to about breaking that code ! I 'm meeting with somebody in an hour . I might know something later tonight . I just need some kind of assurance ... that they 're not gonna let us hang ourselves with this . That I 'm doing the right thing . I 'll try to find out . I need to know one more thing , Mulder ? Why did you attack Skinner ? I 've thought about that , Scully . I honestly can 't say . - This is all you have ? - Currently , yes . There are words I recognize , but you 'll need an actual code talker to make sense of this . I know a man who might help . I can have him contact you . Yeah , thank you . Uh , could you tell me which words you do recognize ? This word ... It means " goods , " " merchandise . " And this one means " vaccination . " They 're both modern words , which is why they stand out . Thank you . You 've been very helpful . Mulder . Fox , this is your father . - I need to see you right away . - Where are you ? I 'm at home . How soon can you be here ? Fox ? It 's very important . Mulder ? - Fox . - Dad . What is it , Dad ? Come in . It 's ... It 's so clear now . Simple . It was so complicated then . The ... The choices that needed to be made . What choices , Dad ? You 're a smart boy , Fox . Smarter than I ever was . About what ? Your politics are yours . You have never thrown in . The minute you do that , their doctrines become yours . And you can be held responsible . You 're talking about your work in the state department . You 're going to learn of things , Fox . You 're going to hear the words . And they 'll come to make sense to you . What words ? The " merchandise . " Look , I , um ... I 've been taking some medication . You 'll have to excuse me for a moment . Dad ? Dad ! Dad . Oh , Dad . Forgive me . Hello ? My father 's dead , Scully . Where are you ? They shot him . And he 's dead . Mulder , where are you ? Just tell me where you are . I 'm on the Vineyard . Who shot him , Mulder ? - I don 't know . - Mulder , were you arguing ? I didn 't do it , Scully . He was trying to tell me something . - Mulder , listen to me . - You 've gotta believe me , Scully . Mulder , I believe you . Just listen to me . You 've got to get out of there . You have to leave immediately . I can 't leave the crime scene . It 'll look like I 'm running . - Like I 'm guilty . - They 're gonna suspect you anyway . You 've got no I.D. On the shooter . Your behavior has been irrational lately . Mulder , can 't you see that everything is pointing directly at you ? He was shot with somebody else 's weapon . Damn it , Mulder , you 're an F.B.I. Agent ! You have access to weapons other than your own . Meet me back at my apartment . No . No , you can 't come home . Somebody shot through your window tonight . They almost killed me . They may be trying to kill you . Oh . Mulder . Thank God . Look at you . You 're sick . I 'm all right . I 'm okay . No , come on . I want you to lie down . Come on . I want you to lie down . Take your coat off . You 've gotta find him , Scully . Right now you have to lie down . We gotta find out who killed my father . Well , right now you need to rest , okay ? Rest . It 's okay . It 's okay . Scully ? I 'll run a comparison as soon as they send me the bullet removed from the victim . How long will it take to determine if they 're a match ? They 're both nine-millimeter rounds . Run the specs . Compare the strike . We should know pretty much right away . - Scully . - You took my gun . You think I did it , don 't you ? I took your gun to run it through ballistics to try and clear you . - Why didn 't you ask me ? - You had a temperature of 102 last night . - I didn 't wanna wake you . - Were you afraid I was gonna shoot you too ? I 'm being called into Skinner 's office this afternoon . They 're gonna want answers , and I 'd like good ones to give them . So you can clear your conscience and your name ? You 've been making reports on me since the beginning . Taking your little notes ! Mulder , you 're sick . You 're not thinking straight . - I 'm on your side . You know that . - Look . You have my files and you have my gun . Don 't ask me for my trust . Mul ... - Keep it . - Thank you . Damn . I 'm gonna kill you anyway , Krycek , so you might as well tell me the truth . Did you kill my father ? Did you kill him ? Answer me ! Mulder ! - Don 't shoot him . Just back away . - He killed my father , Scully ! - I have him , Mulder . - No , Scully ! Oh , my God ! Somebody call the police ! He 's awake . Mulder ? Mulder , it 's me . Here . Drink some of that . You haven 't had any water in over 36 hours . Your shoulder 's going to be fine . The round went through nice and clean . - You shot me . - Yes , I did . You didn 't give me much choice . You were about to kill Krycek . - Why 'd you shoot me ? He 's the one . - If he is , then his weapon is probably the same one that killed your father . - What are you talking about ? - If you killed Krycek with that weapon , there would have been no way to prove that you didn 't kill your father . I 'm sorry about your father , Mulder . I haven 't been able to tell you . How 'd you know it was Krycek ? I didn 't . I went back to your apartment to pull the slug from the wall . But I noticed an unmarked van delivering soft water . And I found this in one of the tanks servicing your building . - What is it ? - It 's a dialysis filter . It 's a device used in the transmission of substances to solution . Considering the level of psychosis you were experiencing , it was possibly L.S.D. , amphetamines ... or some kind of exotic dopeaminagonist . Oh , my God . There was a murder in my building . Well , it wasn 't an exercise in subtlety . Mulder , these men are quite possibly the same ones who killed your father ... and who systematically tried to destroy you ... by turning everyone you could trust against you . I don 't think I have to tell you why . I 'd gotten too close to the truth . - Where are we ? - We 're in Farmington , New Mexico . - New Mexico ? - We 've just driven two days across country . I had to put you out to let the side effects of the psychosis abate . I had to put you out to let the side effects of the psychosis abate . This is Albert Holstein . He 's been translating your files . You 're lucky she 's a good shot . Or a bad one . Albert was a Navajo code talker during World War II . He helped encode the original government documents . How did you find him ? Through a woman in Washington . But he claims that he knew you were coming . Last week , we had an omen . Most of these files are written in jargon . But apparently there was an international conspiracy of silence ... dating back to the 1940s . Albert says that evidence of these secrets are buried ... on a Navajo reservation not far from here . He says that he 'll take you as soon as you 're able . What about you ? I 'm afraid you 're on your own with this . I didn 't show up for a meeting with Skinner day before yesterday . - I don 't know what the repercussions will be . - You 've taken a big risk . I was certain they would have killed you , Mulder . Thank you . Thank you for taking care of me . There 's something else . My name is in those files . It appears in the latest entries with Duane Barry 's . - In what context ? - It 's not clear . But it has something to do with a test . I want you to find out , Mulder . I need you to . You said you knew I was coming . In the desert things find a way to survive . Secrets are like this too . They push their way up through the sands of deception ... so men can know them . Here . This is my house . But why me ? You are prepared to accept the truth , aren 't you ? To sacrifice yourself to it ? I don 't understand . There was a tribe of Indians who lived here more than 600 years ago . Their name was Anasazi . It means " the ancient aliens . " No evidence of their fate exists . Historians say they disappeared without a trace . They say that because they will not sacrifice themselves to the truth . And what is the truth ? Nothing disappears without a trace . You think they were abducted ? By visitors who come here still . - What 's buried out there ? - Lies . You will see for yourself . It 's down there . - Mulder . - You 're a hard man to reach . Not hard enough apparently . - Where are you ? - I 'm at the Betty Ford Center . Where are you ? I need to talk to you , Mr. Mulder , in person . There are things to explain . I 'll save the government the plane fare . I just need to know which government that is . Your father may have told you things , Mr. Mulder . I should warn you against ... - taking those things at face value . - Which things are those ? He was never an opponent of the project . In fact , he authorized it . That 's what he couldn 't live with . No , he couldn 't live with it because you had him killed . - We weren 't involved in that . - Listen to me , you black-lunged son of a bitch . I 'm going to expose you and your project . Your time is over . Expose anything , and you only expose your father . - Sir , we got a coordinate on him . We 're ready to go . - Let 's go . Okay , take her up . Over here . - This is a boxcar . - Refrigeration car . - Scully . - Yeah , it 's me . - Where are you ? - Nowhere I ever expected . What do you mean ? I 'm in a boxcar buried inside a quarry . - There are bodies everywhere . - Bodies ? Stacked floor to ceiling . - What happened to them ? - I don 't know . Mulder , in these files , I found references to ... experiments that were conducted here in the U. S ... by Axis power scientists who were given amnesty after the war . What kind of experiments ? Some kind of tests on humans . But they 're referred to as " merchandise . " But these aren 't humans , Scully . From the look of it , I 'd say they were alien . Are you sure ? I 'm pretty damn sure . Wait a second . This one , it has a smallpox vaccination scar . - Mulder . - Oh , my God , Scully . What have they done ? Mulder ? Mulder , what happened ? Move out ! Get away from there ! You go back ! Cover us . - We 're goin ' in . - Clear ! Go ! What 's your name , boy ? He 's not here . Where 's Mulder ? He 's here . No , sir . If he was , he 's vanished without a trace . Nothing vanishes without a trace . Burn it ! Clear out ! Move it , move it , move it !

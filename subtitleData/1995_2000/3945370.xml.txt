 Crichton : Fine , yes , you 're right . We know almost nothing about the Tavloids . Tavleks . Whatever . Tavloid , Tavlek . We do know that they will pay us to haul cargo which they 're not going to do if you go in there doing your John Wayne impression . John Wayne ? Who 's that ? A relative ? John Wayne ? The big guy . True Grit , The Searchers , The Cowboys , Genghis Khan . Look , forget about Genghis Khan everybody makes a bad movie ... but the point is ... No . The point is , I 'm not going to meet that shuttle unarmed . It 's as simple as that . Kung Fu .. . Kung Fu .. . never carried a gun . We , Rygel the 16th , Dominar of the Hynerian Empire and beloved sovereign of over 600 billion subjects ... welcome to our yacht . I still say it 's a bad idea . I should be taller . It 's tall enough already . I need them to look up to me . Why ? we don 't . Well , you should . If it wasn 't for me , we 'd starve . On Porzin Two , it was I ... All you got was stale food cubes . Which you ate more than your fair share of , as I recall . Who are you to order me around ? Order ? I was offering a suggestion . Well , who are you to offer suggestions ? Am I the only species in creation that doesn 't thrive on conflict ? All of you , shut up . Yes , that 's right . Shut up . Now , the Tavleks believe ... " Shut up " includes you . Now , we don 't even know what this Tavlek cargo is . It could be contraband , vermin-infested , even toxic . Well , let 's hope so . We could charge more . D 'argo , we 've had this discussion . You were outvoted . Oh , argue later . They 've docked . Positions , please . Come on now . If you must address me , do so as your Supreme Eminence . Which you should be doing anyway . No movement . Remain where you are . Move and you die . Try me . You ... you 've misunderstood ... What do you think you 're doing ? I demand someone help me ! D 'argo , look out . Someone put a stop to this ! You 'll pay for ... And now you die . Crichton : Yo , buttkiss ! Cover me. I 'll get the Dominar . Pilot , shut the door ! Rygel : Unhand me ! Please ! Please ! How does it work ? Junk ! Where 's Rygel ? D 'Argo : Junk ! Our Supreme Eminence has been bagged . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship- - a living ship Full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me , help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... I ' m being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . Pilot , get a tractor beam on that shuttle ! Trakterbeem ? What 's that ? Graviton field , attracto-ray , super glue ... Whatever it is you yanked me aboard with . You mean the docking web . Fine , use it on the shuttle . It 's out of range . Well , then go after it . Correction , Pilot . Break orbit and take us away from this wretched planet . Take us away ? They 've got Rygel . Rygel brought this on himself . I say we leave him there . Let Crichton finish . Look , enough talk . We are leaving now . Th-that can 't be normal . H-how did you do that ? It just happened . Wait . That is a very versatile and powerful weapon . If we can work out how to use it ... What is this ? is it injecting something into you ? It stuck some needles in my arm . Oh , no , that can 't be good . Take it off . Let go of me ! D 'argo ... This ship needs a leader , and none of you have what it takes . From now on , I am in charge . Never lay your hands on me again . You go after him . I 'll revive the boy . Crichton : D 'argo , would you wait ? No. I 'm giving the orders now . D 'argo , just listen . He 's not good at listening , is he ? Well , he 'll listen to this . Aeryn , no . Would you listen ? ( sniffing ) Take it easy , child . Child ? ! Don 't be afraid . We won 't hurt you . Speak for yourself . That weapon of yours . How do we get it off ? You mean one of you was stupid enough to put it on ? You 're too weak to handle it . Why ? what is that stuff it pumps in you ? A stimulant . Adds to our strength . A stimulant ? It 's a little more than cappuccino , pal . Our friend just tried to kill us . Good . How do we remove it ? You can 't . Well , it came off when I knocked you out . That 'd make sense. lf you 're left unconscious in battle you don 't want the enemy cutting your arm off to get your weapon . Hmm . You can be disarmed without having to be dis-armed . Great . So what do we got that can knock D 'argo out ? Stun gun ? Gas grenade ? Sleep mist . I can formulate one . Was that necessary ? It felt good . Give me navigation , now . But we can 't leave orbit ... Do as I say or I 'll rip off all your arms . Enough of this stupid voting . From now on , I 'll make the decisions . Don 't even think about it . Unless we leave orbit D 'argo 's actually threatening to injure me . Stall him . Tell him there 's a systems malfunction or something . I told him that but he doesn 't believe me . In fact , he ... Hold on . Transmission from the planet . Bekhesh : We 've got your king . You can buy him back . Aeryn : We 've got your boy , and if you want him back undamaged ... Whoa ! Ho ! How about an even swap ? No . He 's part of the price , but he 's not worth a king . We want corvinium , purity nine . Enough to fill your transport hangar . This hangar ? Divided among 600 billion affluent subjects it 's not so much . You won 't get it . Pilot : D 'argo 's getting angrier . Do something . Look , this isn 't a good time . How about we call you back ? Bekhesh : No . We 'll contact you in one solar day . If your homeworld hasn 't agreed to our terms by then your king dies . John , it 's finished . Check it out. lt 's a water balloon . Here . What ? Oh , you think you can throw it with any accuracy ? Yeah. I grew up with these things . Excellent . Lock him away . Well , I suppose we must . Come . Pilot , get Moya moving . I told you , I can 't . You 're lying . You 're all undermining my command ... Crichton : Good night , sweet prince . Uh-oh . ( growling ) This way . Oh , is that another suggestion of yours ? Pilot , on my signal give me all the acceleration Moya 's got . No . I can 't activate propulsion . Moya has a systems malfunction . For real ? Propulsion control is completely out . I 've had to shut down and vent manually . The ship 's excess supercoolant has to be released . Look , we 're wasting time here . Wait . Wait , just wait . Close all the vents . I can 't do that . The pressure could build to dangerous levels . No , it won 't . I got a plan . I 'm not afraid of you . You 're soft and weak . Pilot : Zhaan ? Yes ? Soft , yes . Weak , no . What was that , Pilot ? Secure for acceleration . Crichton has an idea . ( sighs ) : Did you say Crichton ? Pa 'u delvia , kolmot gorr tibnol . D 'Argo : Come out from where you 're hiding , you cowards . Cool it . Now . D 'argo . D 'Argo : Peacekeeper coward ! ( breathing heavily ) Now . You challenge my command ... Now . Do it to my face . - Do it now ! - We 'll see who 's left standing . ( groaning ) That was your plan ? Yeah . Worked pretty good . Oh , barely . That is the last time I go along with one of your plans . Fine ! Next time you get to make the plan . Rygel : I demand to speak to whoever 's in charge . I will not be treated like this . How dare you bury me in mud . Are you listening ? You 're nothing but barbarians . Don 't you know this is an act of war ? ! When my council hears of this the Hynerian Navy will scorch this hellhole ! Hmm , that should get them thinking . Jotheb : My sleep cycle has been disturbed . As if I give a garanta 's brax ! Who are you ? Jotheb ... Next in succession to preside over the Consortium of Trao . And you ? Dominar Rygel the 16th , ruler of the Hynerian Empire . The Hynerian empire is not familiar to me . Yeah ? Well , I never heard of the Consortium of Trao . The imperfection is yours . How big is it ? Ten thousand . Ha ! Ha ! I have six hundred billion subjects ! Ten thousand planets , each averaging per planet four billion Trao . I don 't believe you . The imperfection is yours . This malfunction is Rygel 's fault ? Pilot : That 's right . He asked if he could borrow a vital component of Moya 's control circuitry just for a while . And you let him ? Certainly not. I flatly forbade it . What did he want it for ? He said it was important to impress our visitors . Impress ... ? How is a control circuit going to impress somebody ? Oh , Moya 's synaptic processors are quite attractive objects . trillions of silico-neurons suspended in a semi-organic crystalline matrix . Crystal ... no ... Reddish crystal ? About that big ? Yes . His scepter . The little hair ball took it to decorate his scepter . I 'm going to kill him . How long can Moya maintain orbit without the crystal ? Her orbit 's deteriorating even now . I 'll torture him , then I 'll kill him . Zhaan ? Can 't you rouse D 'argo ? No . He 's not injured , but he 's sleeping off the drug . There 's no telling when he 'll awaken . I can 't wait for him . Pilot , prepare the Prowler . Very well . Come on . You 're not going down there ? If we don 't get that crystal back we 're going to crash into the planet . I 've got a plan . Oh , no , please , let me guess . Your plan . Jam down to the planet , conduct a commando-style raid against what ? A couple of dozen heavily-armed Tavloids and then haul ass back up to the ship . Tavleks . That 's your plan ? Wile E. Coyote would come up with a better plan than that ! You 're just going to go down there by yourself ? No , of course not . You 're coming with me . Oh , in your dreams I 'm coming with you . This is my turn . My plan . Now , let 's go . No . Absolutely not . There are other things that we can do . We can try negotiating with the Tavloids ... Tavleks . Aeryn : Has Moya located the Tavlek shuttle ? No . Her sensors can 't penetrate the jungle canopy . Too many chloroferric compounds in the vegetation . Pilot says we can reconfigure the sensors . Even if you can 't , I 'm following the same trajectory their shuttle did and I should land reasonably close to them . We can negotiate with the ... You hit me . Hit ? I ... No , a Panthak jab . You were more susceptible than most . Next time you hit me make sure that I don 't wake up . ( clicking tongue ) : Oh ... Oh , don 't ... ( clicking tongue ) me . This is not over with . And when it is , you and I are going to sit down and have a serious talk . Sure . When this is over , you and I will probably be dead . Care for some food ? I 'm not hungry . Are you in discomfort ? What kind of fastener is this ? Where 's my clothes ? I want them back now . We had to borrow them . Had to ? Or did you just want to strip me ? What 's the matter ? Too prim to sneak a peak ? You afraid you might like what you saw ? You ever looked at a male before , huh ? Well , here you go . Quite respectable for your age . Did you think you 'd shock me ? is nudity a taboo in your culture ? Are you ashamed of your bodies ? Well , we would be if we looked like you . I doubt it . Are you sure you 're not hungry ? ( quietly ) : No . Before we landed , I saw signs of an encampment past that ridge . ( grunts ) You shanghai my ass down here . Now you want me to lead ? Give me one good reason . Lots of reasons . Land mines , fire snakes , razor grass , night-vision snipers , morlian death spiders ... ( grunting ) ( stomach growling ) Jotheb : That dreadful noise is what ? That 's my stomach . What of it ? You have failed to dine ? My meal was just delivered . ( grunts ) They fed you first ? I don 't want any food anyway . I want out . There must be a way . There 's always a way . Our captors may be annoyed by escape attempts . We just can 't lie around waiting to be ransomed . We have to push ! ( grunting ) Rygel : Here ! Let me show you . You don 't have to worry , Jotheb . When my fleet arrives , it 'll lay waste to this planet . Anyone who defends Bekhesh will be killed but anyone who helps us will , uh ... Your rations . ( nervous chuckle ) You see ? First you give them something to think about and then you ... Ah ! is there a problem ? This bowl . It 's a skull . That can be no one you knew . Ah , excuse me , will you ? Stop looking at me . Hey , hey ! Tentacles off ! Tentacles off ! What do you think you 're doing ? It was unwanted by you . Doesn 't mean you can have it . ( groaning softly ) Feeling better ? He insists on helping us adjust the sensors despite his fatigue . Only because you 'll do it wrong . ( angry grunt ) lf you need more rest ... No , no. I , uh ... ( wearily ) : I need to do something . Make myself useful . Your assistance would be welcomed . Enjoying yourself ? Oh , yeah . Marching through a smelly , bug-infested jungle . If this is your idea of a good time , I bet you don 't get a lot of second dates . ( guns fire ) Hand me the oculars . What ? Aeryn : Hunting party . They 've made a kill . I say we follow them . They might lead us back to their camp , back to Rygel . We don 't have time to let them lead us back to their camp . I 'm going to have to force them to tell me where Rygel is . Force them ? How are you going to force them ? There 's one of you and three of them . ( metallic whirring ) Whew . Are you nuts ? After what that thing did to D 'argo , we agreed only as a last resort . Besides , if we go in there blazing ... I 'm going in . You 're staying here . ( grunts ) This won 't take long . When I get back , you can put me under and remove the gauntlet . The minute you get back . ( sighs ) Your pardon . I 'm on my way back to Bekhesh but I seem to have gotten my bearings confused . You mean you 're lost . Yeah , okay , I 'm lost . Find your own way back . We 're busy . ( yells and grunts ) ( gagging ) All right , I 'll ask again . Where 's Bekhesh ? Crichton : Come on , Aeryn . Crichton : They 're getting up . Follow the outcropping around ... ( soft , high-pitched whining ) What the hell ? ( loud droning ) Oh , shit ! ( Crichton yelling ) ( explosion ) we 're under attack ! Get to cover ! Move ! This way ! Pilot , are you sure those reconfigured sensors are working ? That looked like an explosion . It was . Also picking up weapons fire . Didn 't take them long to get into trouble . Ready a transport . Oh , what happened ? Wait . Where 's the rifle ? All over the place . Am I bleeding ? You blew up the rifle ? It 's not like I meant to . Damn thing malfunctioned or something . Or you overloaded the pulse chamber . Just-just drop it . Let 's move before they find us . It 's all right. I 'll take them all on . Aeryn , move . Stop. I 'm going ! Bekhesh : Jotheb , message from your people . Two days till your ransom arrives . You 're free to go once it shows up . Hey ! Hey ! What about me ? Keep silent , Rygel . What about you ? I demand better treatment . You dare serve me with this grotesquery of a bowl ? My apologies your Eminence . I should think so . So , Jotheb , your subjects came up with your ransom ? It was not in doubt . Why ? Yours will not ? Absolutely . Who says they won 't ? Ah , there you are . Now , what have you got for me ? An extra helping . Any more trouble and it 'll be your skull that serves as someone 's bowl . ( anguished yelling ) ( groaning ) Get out ! ( grunts ) I can help you . l-l don 't want your help ! You 're in no condition to choose . This should relieve the symptoms of withdrawal . And this will remove the pain . I can 't eat this . I couldn 't eat this . I mustn 't eat this . Hmm ... Maybe it has another use . Hmm ... ln what way , friend Rygel ? Loosening up the soil . Right . The camp should be just up ahead . I 'm going to enjoy this . No . No , you 're not going anywhere near there . Not till we get that gauntlet off . - No ! - Yes ! You agreed . Only as long as it was necessary . And it is necessary . Bekhesh is still breathing . Aeryn , that gauntlet is messing with your head . No , it 's not. I am going to take out every last Tavlek . No survivors , no mercy . Now give me the oculars ! Fine . I believe you and I have some business first . Oh , yes . You called me a coward , and you 'll die for that . Your gauntlet against my Qualta Blade ? D 'Argo : You truly are cowardly . Can 't you defeat me without your weapons ? What a barbarian . Okay , so you 'll die more slowly . ( yelling ) ( hissing ) Nice blanket you got there , D 'argo . A lumpy blanket . Get her off . ( grunting ) Jotheb ? A little help ? Help ? Of what sort ? Pull . ( grunting ) ( grunting ) Pull . Maybe around the throat isn 't a good idea . Rygel : Yes , that 's it . Yes ! ( grunting ) : That did it ! I 'm free ! ( grunting ) Jotheb : Rygel , look out ! Rygel ! No , no , no , don 't ! ( gasping ) Bekhesh , you 're killing him . Yes , you 're right . ( gasping and grunting ) Why was he killed ? Why not ? Who 'd pay to get himback ? The Consortium of Trao will . There 's truth to my words , Bekhesh . I will prove his value . ( coughing ) The fame of Dominar Rygel has spread even to myworlds . If the ransom is not paid by his people it will be paid by mine . ( coughing ) I could always kill him again . ( wheezing ) ( grunting ) Lie still . You 're wiped out . The gauntlet has drained you . Oh ? You called me a coward . - You called me a barbarian . - Well , you are . Well , perhaps " coward " is too good a word for a Peacekeeper . Both of you , knock it off . You didn 't mean what you said . It was the gauntlet talking . I meant everything I said . Yeah , so did I . You also mean everything you did ? You attacked us , tried to take over the ship and you , you 're ready to slaughter every Tavloid on the planet anyway . - Tavlek . - Tavlek . Whatever . The gauntlet brings out the real you , both of you think long and hard about therapy . I 'm going to go check things out . Play nice while I 'm gone . Has the pain ceased ? Hmm ... That stimulant in your gauntlet , it must have been extremely addictive . But once your body purifies the hunger for the drug should pass . Look , I don 't need a damn sermon . I didn 't ask for your help so keep your speeches to yourself . But about the gauntlet , it 's not as if I ever had any choice . There are always choices ... Look , I told you , I don 't need a sermon . All right , no sermons . What do you need ? Actually , I am a bit hungry . I hate this . Does your head hurt ? Yes . Yours ? Pounding like a Maxzillian Pilater Day Parade . I 'm so tired . It took a few hours for me to fully recover , so I imagine for a Sebacean we should probably double that . Oh , don 't be so childish . Perhaps it took quite a few hours for me to recover . Crichton should be back by now . Well , he 's probably at the wrong end of some Tavlek weapon somewhere . Imagine , somewhere out there there 's a whole world full of Crichtons . How useless that must be . It 's amazing he could provide us with some common ground . Who would have thought there 'd be a race more clumsy and pathetic than the Luxans . Ow ! I 'm sorry . You know how clumsy we Luxans can be . Jotheb : Rygel , you 're welcomed into the Consortium of Trao . Oh , yes . Well , thank you for the invitation , but I ... lt is not an invitation . You were killed by Bekhesh and revived by me . You are , therefore , owned by me , as are your subjects . is that so ? You 're going to pay my ransom , too ? The expense is small and billions of Hynerians will be brought into the consortium . ( laughing ) You multi-throated moron . I don 't have any subjects . ( growling ) How dare you ! I was deposed over a hundred cycles ago . Ransom me if you want but all you 'll get is me ! Just you ? No subjects ? No . Not a one . My treacherous bastard of a cousin stole my throne and imprisoned me . I escaped with a few other fugitives and they 're the only ones who know I 'm here ! Won 't they ransom you ? They couldn 't if they wanted to , and they don 't want to , because they hate me ! Then you will die here . So why are you laughing ? ! ( sobbing ) The camp 's pretty deserted. lt looks like most of them are napping . Go for it now , or wait till nightfall ? We don 't even know if this planet rotates . It may never get dark . This may be our only chance . Let 's go . No . You 're wiped out . You stay here . Two 's enough . Well take the gauntlet , then . No , no , no , no , no . No , the damn thing 's a menace . Besides , it 'd still be one gauntlet against a whole camp full of them . If we can 't pull this thing off without being spotted , we 're screwed . And what if you are spotted ? Cover our retreat . Well , with what ? Well , someone blew up our only weapon . Take this . Oh , yes , a sword . Thank you . That 'll be really helpful . It is more than just a sword . ( grunting ) is it charged ? It was , when the Peacekeepers took it from me . How long ago was that ? Eight cycles . Ah , this food is horrible . Almost inedible . You 're welcome . Thank you for being such a gracious guest . What are you ? Older , wiser . Certainly not as hungry as you . When I was sick before , sweating and shaking , you did that thing where you ... When I kissed you ? No . Ah , yes . When you took the pain away . How did you do that ? I am a Delvian Pa 'u . A priest of the Ninth Level . We learn to share others ' pain . Tavleks learn how to inflict it . Yes , I 've seen you in action . Very impressive . Yes , it was . We boarded your ship , stole your king . I was a part of that . That is who you are when you wear the gauntlet . But perhaps the real you is ... Sick of hearing your plok . That I know for sure . Have you ever been through anything like this before ? Your body being freed of poisons . Poison ? This is the only poison I have in my body . Why would I want to be ' free ' ? Our gauntlet is our food , our blood , our life . It makes us capable of anything . I know that is what you believe . But what I wonder is what you alone are capable of . ( yelling ) Sorry . Offense is not taken . Hey , check out the critter . " Critter " ? " Critter " ? D 'Argo : What 's your problem ? Find Rygel . Hey ! It 's the scepter , but where is the crystal ? It 's gone , and so is Rygel . Dominar Rygel ? He was taken away . To where ? Through my efforts Rygel is believed to be valuable by Bekhesh . Therefore , Rygel is being moved via shuttle to a more secure location . Any more secure , and we 'll never get that crystal back . Come on , let 's get this guy out of here . Staying here is my preference . I am awaiting my release . Rygel should be informed that his ransom will not be paid by the Consortium of Trao . His presence has been decided to be too disruptive . I can dig that . Fine , I 'll tell him . As you will . Crichton : Hi . Uh ... Where 's Bekhesh ? We came to discuss the ransom terms . I think we can reach a deal . Stand fast . Right , D 'argo ? Mmm ... Go , go , go ! ( groaning ) Good work . That 's how you create a diversion . It 's a fine weapon . ( panting ) : I request that you bury me with it . Oh , damn . Just take it easy . D 'Argo : The blood , what color is it ? It 's , uh ... it 's dark red , almost black . ( panting ) What are you doing ? Bleeding freely is the only thing that will help heal the Luxan . The wound isn 't cleansed until the blood flows clear . D 'Argo : Just do it ! ( Aeryn grunts ) ( pounding continues ) Tired ? ( mumbles ) You need more sleep . I 'll take you back to your quarters . Pilot : Zhaan , you 're needed in the Command . Quickly , please . I know my way back . Pilot : Crichton wants us to scan the area for any signs of the Tavlek shuttle . I 've picked up a shuttle in your area . It 's priming for takeoff . No more than three minutes . Location ? Delta six , pemno nine , ierg eight . is that anywhere near here ? Directional vector . ( DRD squeaking ) ( frantically squeaking ) That young savage ! He 's attacked one of the DRDs . Where ? Maintenance Bay , Lab Section . Lerg eight there . We 're here . We 'll never cover that ground in three minutes . You two won 't , that 's for sure . Neither can you . I might , with a little help . D 'Argo : Oh , no. lt 's too dangerous . D 'argo 's right . Yeah , yeah , I know. I 'm just nothing but a frail human but we need that gem , so unless one of you two 's got a better idea . Right . So once I get it on , how do I get it to work ? It just , uh ... does . Right . Willpower , like the Green Lantern 's ring . ( sighing ) : Okay , here goes nothing . ( mechanical swishing ) ( swishing continues ) I 'm sorry , I ... I don 't feel anything . In fact , I feel pretty good . Feel real good . Oh , right . It 's working . ( door opening ) Couldn 't sleep ? Give that to me . I need it ! Give it to me ! is this the way you repay my help ? How would you like yourarm torn off ? ( groaning ) ( derisive chuckle ) You don 't scare me . You don 't even have the guts to fight me ! ( crackling ) ( groaning ) Hear me . I could rip you apart right now , Khalaan help me , I 'd enjoy it , but you know why I don 't ? Because we 're not enemies . ( groans ) This is your enemy . Contemplate that in solitude . is it running clear ? No , it 's still reddish black . ( sighing ) Give it up . Oh , so you 'd die without putting up a fight . Then you 're the coward . ( pounding ) ( groaning ) and you 're ... the barbarian . You 're going to have to hit it a lot harder than that to increase the bleeding . Hmm . ( pounding ) ( groaning ) Again . ( grunting ) Okay , let 's see what you got . ( Rygel grumbling ) Freeze ! ( groaning ) ( groaning ) ( snickering ) Rygel : What 's going on ? Who 's out there ? Someone answer me ! ( Rygel grumbling ) You didn 't kill them . Guess I 'm not that kind of a guy . Crichton , is that you ? Get me out of here . Shut up , Rygel . Hand me the bag . ( Rygel groaning ) Take him . ( groaning ) lf you can . Oh , have it your way . ( groaning ) ( snickering ) Fool . You 'll have to do better than that . ( swishing ) Just watch me . ( whirring ) ( sighs ) ( clears throat ) Hey , Bekhesh , how about we call this thing a draw ? You don 't really want Rygel anyway . Why don 't I ? Because , uh , he 's not really a king . I 'm not ? He 's not ? He 's an escaped mental patient ; delusions of royalty . You 're the mental patient if you expect anybody 'd to believe that I ... Oh ! He 's not insane . I could be . Okay , right , yeah . No , he 's not insane , but , uh , he is sick . ( coughing ) He 's very sick . Very contagious . You ever hear of chicken pox ? He 's not sick . Right , he 's not sick , but he ... but he is worthless . No one is going to pay his ransom . The Consortium of Trao will . No ... they won 't . I just talked to your other prisoner the four-throated cat ? They 're not going to do it . What , do you blame them ? Rygel is an obnoxious gas-bag and who 's going to shell out for that ? He 's right. I 'm unloved , unwanted , unpopular ... ( weakly ) : unconscious . Look , Bekhesh , we couldn 't pay your ransom if we wanted to . Rygel lied to impress you . We got nothing . No corvinium ? No corvinium , no gold , no jewels , no munitions . You don 't believe me call my ship . Talk to your boy . Your leader wishes to speak with you . ( beeping ) Bekhesh . You 've spent time with them . Tell me , are they wealthy ? Have you seen any riches onboard ? I won 't lie for you . No one 's asked you to . I 've seen much of their ship . It 's pathetic . They have no riches and all they have to eat is food cubes . Are they forcing you to say that ? If they mistreated you in any way ? You just say the word , and I 'll re-take their ship and slaughter the lot of them . No , they haven 't mistreated me . In fact , they 've been trying to help me . Help you ? Why ? I don 't really know . ( beeps ) Perhaps I like to offer choices . Suppose l still don 't believe you ? Then you might as well shoot us all because I 've told you the truth . It 's been so long since anyone 's told me the truth , I don 't recognize it anymore . ( Rygel whimpering ) Take this royal pain out of my sight . ( Rygel screaming ) ( Rygel groaning ) ( coughing ) Where 's the you-know-what ? I knew you wouldn 't come back just for me . What 'd you do with it ? It 's safe and sound . Did you swallow it ? ! Swallow it ? Yes , yes . Which means you 're going to have to take me back as I am or disembowel me here . Don 't you tempt me , fluffy . Whoa ... ( exhausted ) : Well ... am I to live or die ? Die ... but not today . Rygel : Hurry up , Crichton . Crichton : Shut up , Rygel . ( Rygel grumbling ) Piece of cake . ( groaning ) ( Rygel yelling ) ( Rygel coughing , groaning ) ( Rygel grunting ) Rygel , hurry up . Rygel : You can come in if you want to . No ! No , you , uh ... you just , uh , get a move on . ( Rygel grunting , spits loudly ) Rygel : Well , I don 't see why you 're so upset . I would have put it right back if those savages hadn 't kidnapped me . I didwash it . Well , I think I did . ( humming mischievously ) ( screen whirring ) Curious how you 're doing . Kyr : Much better now that I have the gauntlet back on . My choice . ( whirring ) No sermons .

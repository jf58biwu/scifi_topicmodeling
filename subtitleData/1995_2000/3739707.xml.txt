 God tests our faith so that we may not take it for granted . I once gave counsel to a little girl . She was very distraught because her older brother had told her that Moses hadn 't really parted the Red Sea . He said that high winds and strong ocean currents had been responsible . In hearing this , the faith of this child had been severely shaken . In order to restore her credence , she had but one question for me . She asked " Reverend , is there really such a thing as a miracle , or are the stories in the Bible just make-believe , fairy tales ? " I assured her " Yes , miracles really do happen . " Most people today tend to vest themselves in science and cynicism . They expect proof for all that they see . But miracles are wondrous by nature . They need no rationale . No justification . You must witness the miracles of the Lord without question . My blood flows as a test of your faith . Open your souls to the divine possibilities . It is then and only then that you will truly understand the awesome powers of the almighty Lord . Yes ? I was impressed with your sermon , Reverend . Thank you . I just wanna tell you that some of us do believe . I appreciate that . It always does my heart good to know that I 've touched at least one person . Oh , I think you had quite an effect on a lot of people . Me , most of all . Oh , my God ! No ! These ligature marks on his neck are consistent with rope or fabric burns , strongly suggesting that he was strangled . But there seems to be an awful lot of blood loss here . His parishioners said he was bleeding from his hands , like the wounds of the Crucifixion . Stigmata ? A sign bestowed by God upon the righteous . I don 't see any wounds here on his hands or wrists or otherwise . No . I think this is a case of too much faith . - And too much sugar . - What are you doing ? It 's fake . - Just like the others . - Others ? I 've been tracking a series of religiously motivated murders . All the victims have been so-called stigmatics , and frauds , like the reverend here . According to religious lore , at any given time there are 12 stigmatics in the world , representing the 12 Apostles . The claim is unsubstantiated , but there have been many pretenders . 11 have been murdered in the past three years . 11 ? Any clue as to the motivation ? Either it 's a psychotic religious fanatic who 's hellbent on exposing these frauds or a less programmatic psycho with a murderous resentment towards the Church . Or maybe it 's just a very disgruntled altar boy . Well , that narrows down the field . It 's safe to say this guy carries a grudge . If I 'm right about one thing , the killer is here . And he 's looking for victim number 12 . All right , let 's sit down . I trust everyone has studied his or her flashcards for today 's quiz ? All right , let 's settle down . Geek ! Kevin Kryder ? I assume , Kevin , that in the last 24 hours you 've become quite the math wizard . Why don 't you come on up to the board and share with us your gift of numbers ? Let 's try some division . You do know the division sign , don 't you , Kevin ? Let 's divide 11 ... into 170 . Ooh ! Blood ! Oh , my God ! - Thank you for contacting us . - When I read the fbi 's alert , - l thought immediately of Kevin . - You said there had been a previous incident . Last year . Kevin arrived at school with bleeding wounds on his hands and feet . Our first concern is always an abusive parent . - Was that the case ? - Well , it appeared so . His father was arrested and we took the boy as a ward of the court . But the state dropped charges for lack of evidence . The mother sued and won custody . Mr Kryder was institutionalized soon after . - institutionalized for what ? - When he leftjail , he locked himself and Kevin in the house . It made all the papers . He was waving a gun at the police , saying he had to protect the boy . That Kevin was chosen by God . Can I talk to you for a minute ? - How 's he doing ? - Fine . Hi , Kevin . My name is Dana Scully . Can I talk to you a minute ? Am I going back to the shelter ? We don 't know just yet . Right now we have to find out what happened . Can you tell me how you got those cuts on your hands ? - No . - No , you can 't tell me or no , you don 't know ? You want me to say my dad did it ! I don 't want you to say anything that isn 't true . I don 't feel that good . He feels a bit feverish . Did you take his temperature ? No , I didn 't . Open . You 're a very brave boy , Kevin . You have nothing to be afraid of . - Where 's Kevin ? is he all right ? - He 's doing fine . The nurse is just changing his bandages . Oh , my God. I thought this was all over . Mrs Kryder ? My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm with the fbi . The fbi ? Who called the fbi ? We have reason to believe that Kevin may be in some danger . From what ? Strange as it sounds , someone may be targeting people like Kevin . What do you mean , people like Kevin ? People exhibiting wounds that might be interpreted as having religious significance . - What was that ? - l don 't know . I didn 't do anything. ltjust broke ! Kevin 's just a normal kid . He probably hurt himself out on the playground . I 'm sure there 's an explanation , but our primary concern should be for Kevin 's safety . I 'd like to put him into the shelter until we can sort this out . You don 't think I did this to Kevin ? - You think I cut his hands ? - We don 't know how he got the cuts , but we 'd like some time to evaluate his case , Mrs Kryder . I would never hurt my own child . Do you hear me ? I have fought a battle over my son before that tore my family apart . And I 'm not gonna fight it again . I love my job . - Let 's go , Scully . - The kid 's hands were definitely cut , Mulder . They 're takin ' him into custody . We 've warned them about his safety . Do you know how his hands were cut ? Not yet . My guess is that the kid did it to himself . His father is taken away . He hurts himself to relieve his dad of guilt and to get him back . - Maybe we should talk to his father . - He 's in an institution . His father said that he needed to be protected . Maybe he knows from whom . He 's bleeding again , isn 't he ? - Yes . How did you know that ? - Because the faithful know . Mr Kryder , the claims you 've made for your son may have put him in danger . The child was in danger long before I ever made the claims . Since the day he was born , they 've been watching him . - They ? - The forces of darkness . They will come in the form ... of a powerful and respected man . These forces , what do they want ? To claim all souls . You must understand this is the great war between good and evil . Armageddon ? But God will find someone to stop it . Someone who is strong enough to make the sacrifice . He 's chosen you ? I 'm merely a messenger . Let 's go . You must come full circle to find the truth . Excuse me ? Full circle to find the truth ? I don 't know what that means . You will . The two kids are running down this long hallway . But all the doors are locked . There 's nowhere to go . Soon they 'll both be toast . They can hear his bloody leg dragging on the floor . The mutant is on their trail , hungry for the taste of young meat . - What 's it look like ? - Yeah , what ? Do you really wanna know ? It looks like the Devil . And he 's bald because all his hair has burned off in hell . And his fingers are like pitchforks , with little barbs on the end , so all he has to do is point at you and you can 't get away . With each step he gets closer . Step ... by step ... by step ... by step . He 's so close now that even the furniture starts to shake . Step ... by step ... by step ... by step . Guys , let 's get outta here ! Come on ! What color hair did he have ? Was it brown or blond ... ? He was bald . He didn 't have no hair . Cos it all burned off in hell . How tall was he ? Was he about my height ? Taller ? Shorter ? - Taller . - About six two , six three ? Yeah . Maybe even bigger . And he was dressed all in black . All right . - What 's gonna happen to Kevin ? - All right , kids . What happened to Kevin ? Where is he ? Kevin was abducted from this room . Several children witnessed it . We 're getting a description of the man . But you were supposed to protect him . You said he would be safe . We 're sorry , Mrs Kryder . We 're doing everything we can . - Scully ... - Did you get a composite ? Yeah . Looks like Kevin was abducted by Homer Simpson 's evil twin . - This isn 't the killer , Mulder . - That 's a safe assumption . I mean it doesn 't match the MO . None of the previous victims were abducted . None of the previous victims were ten-year-old boys . - ls this the man that took Kevin ? - Yeah . We 're not sure how accurate that is . - lt 's Owen . - You know this man ? Yeah. lt 's Owen Jarvis . When my husband left , we hired him to do yard work . I carved all the animals myself . It 's the ark . Do you like it ? So when are you gonna take me home , Owen ? There 's no reason to be afraid . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 've been watching you , Kevin . You 're a very special boy . You know that , don 't you ? - l wanna go home . - You can 't do that. I can 't let you . - Why not ? - Because it 's not safe ! I 'm your friend , Kevin . You have to trust me . Just think of me as ... your guardian angel . Don 't say a word . Stay here . Don 't move . Federal agents ! Put down your weapon . Put it down right here . Down ! Now ! Put it down ! Where 's the boy ? Where 's the boy ? Don 't hurt him . Please ? Kevin ? Where 's the boy ? What have you done with Kevin ? He can 't go home . It 's not safe there. I told him that . - ls this Kevin Kryder 's blood ? - Yes . - Did you hurt him ? - No. I 'm not the one that wants to hurt him . If it 's not you , then who is it ? - l was only asked to protect the boy . - By who ? Who asked you to protect him ? God . - That 's quite a long-distance call . - Unless someone protects Kevin ... lt 's the end of the world as we know it , right ? He who has ears , let him hear . And he that has a tongue , let him speak . Now tell me where he is . You believe me , don 't you ? I mean , you must wear that as a reminder . Mr Jarvis , my religious convictions are hardly the issue here . But they are . How can you help Kevin if you don 't believe ? Even the killer , he believes . And townsfolk wonder why I sleep in on Sunday . Mass on Christmas , fish on Friday . You think that makes you a good Christian ? Just because you don 't understand sacrifice , because you 're unwilling , don 't think for a moment that you set the rules for me . I don 't question his word . Whatever he asks of me , I 'll do . - Sit down , Mr Jarvis . - l just want to go to heaven . - Hey ! - Don 't ! Mom ! Mom ! Are you home ? Kevin ? Kevin ? I know you 're here , son . Run , Kevin ! Run ! Kevin , what is it ? Upstairs ! You 'll be OK . You 'll be OK . Are you the one that was sent to protect me ? Owen Lee Jarvis . Adult Caucasian male . 42 years of age . Cause of death is strangulation , consistent with previous victims , as suggested by burn marks around his neck . Except ... There appears to some kind of a pattern just to the right of his windpipe . Possibly a handprint . Note to the lab to check further . It is now 14 hours after the time of death . But so far his body hasn 't even begun to break down . Rigor mortis has yet to set in . His core body temperature remains at 98º . His skin color , lividity , is healthy . There seems to be some ... Any revelations ? Mulder , would you do me a favor ? Would you smell Mr Jarvis ? You want me to smell him ? What am I supposed to be smelling ? You don 't detect a faint floral odor ? Mulder , this man 's body is in no way decomposing normally . In catechism we learned of instances like this . So-called incorruptibles whose bodies wouldn 't decay and who emitted a smell of flowers . - You 're serious ? - Saint Cecilia , Saint Francis ... - And you 're suggesting this is Saint Owen ? - l don 't know . Scully , those stories are mostly regarded as hagiographic fabrications , not historical truths . Just like the stigmata . - Well , what do you think this is ? - This man ? He was abnormal in life . Maybe he 's decomposing abnormally . Well , isn 't a saint or a holy person another term for someone who 's abnormal ? Do you believe that ? I believe in the idea that God 's hand can be witnessed . I believe he can create miracles . Yes . Even if science can 't explain them ? Maybe that 's just what faith is . Well , I wouldn 't let faith overwhelm yourjudgment here . These people are simply fanatics behaving fanatically , using religion as ajustification . They give bona fide paranoiacs like myself a bad name . They 're no more divine or holy than that ketchup we saw on the murdered preacher . I think once you 've finished your autopsy you 'll come to the same conclusion . Saint Owen . - l got your message . What did you turn up ? - lt 's what you turned up . Those burn marks on Jarvis 's neck ? They pulled a pair of prints . Take a look at this . A partial index and a full oblique burned right onto the skin . Any evidence as to how the killer did that ? No , not yet . But I cross-checked the prints in the NClC database . They belong to a businessman named Simon Gates . He 's the CEO of a company based in Atlanta . He 's one of the wealthiest men in the South . A powerful and respected man . He was arrested three years ago on a dui . Left a young boy paralyzed . He received a suspended sentence and then left the country . Went to Israel . - Israel ? - Have you heard of Jerusalem Syndrome ? Yeah. lt 's when people who visit the Holy Land suffer religious delusions . Yeah . They 're convinced they 're the Messiah , Moses , the Virgin Mary , even the Devil . In that case , Simon Gates is as delusional as Mr Kryder , only a lot more dangerous . It still doesn 't explain how he was able to burn his fingerprints into Owen Jarvis 's flesh . Mulder . What ? - Well , how 's that possible ? - lt 's Kevin , isn 't it ? Hold on . A social worker took Kevin out to lunch supposedly , but witnesses claim they saw him outside with his mother at the exact same time . Kevin ! Lay off the horn . Looks like you 're having a little trouble . Can I give you a hand ? No , it 's fine. lt does this all the time . I just have to wait for it to cool down . At least let me take the cap off . That should get things started . - No , I 'm fine . - Really , it 's no trouble at all . In the old days , people used to stop to help . Now they just drive on by . People also used to say thank you . What do you want ? I think you know . - Hey , mister ! - Kevin , run ! No ! Hey , Mom ! Get up ! Please , Mom ! Come on ! Mom ? Mom , are you OK ? Come on , Mom ! Don 't fall asleep ! Wake up ! Come on ! - She died because of me . - lt was an accident , Kevin . Your mother was only trying to protect you . - Why does he wanna hurt me ? - l don 't know . But I won 't let him hurt you. I promise . It 's because I 'm different , isn 't it ? Why can 't I just be like everybody else ? How are you different , Kevin ? Kevin ? I just am . Agent Mulder and I are gonna take you back to the shelter . There 'll be a doctor to take a look at you there . Do I have to go back there ? No . No , you don 't . Why don 't you duck back inside ? is he ready to go ? I want to keep him with us until Gates is apprehended . Look , I know about getting personally involved , and I 'm not . - Did he lD Gates ? - Yes . That 'll help . A man fitting Gates 's description rented the car under the name Forau . That 's one of the Devil 's disciples . I 'll wait right outside . You never draw my bath . Kevin has a cut under his ribs . He was in an accident . No. I was with the paramedics when they were looking at him . - lt wasn 't there . - Maybe you missed it . - No , Mulder. I was paying close attention . - What do you think it is ? Yesterday I saw Kevin 's hands . They were bleeding from wounds on the top and on the bottom . Like in the Crucifixion . - Scully ... - There have been other signs . I haven 't said anything until now because I haven 't been sure . - And I 'm still not sure . - Sure of what exactly ? How Kevin was able to be in two places at once . Just like Saint Ignatius was able to in the Bible . That was in the Bible. lt 's a parable. lt 's a metaphor for the truth , not the truth itself . Why didn 't Kevin conveniently bilocate when Owen Jarvis abducted him ? How is it that you can go out on a limb when you see a light in the sky , but you 're unwilling to accept the possibility of a miracle ? Even when it 's in front of you ! I wait for a miracle every day . But what I 've seen has tested my patience , not my faith . Well , what about what I 've seen ? Kevin ? You OK ? I didn 't lock it . I 'll call the police . They put up a cordon in a ten-mile radius . No sign of them . I figure they had an acetylene torch in a truck . I don 't see how else they could have done it . I wasn 't out of that room for more than two minutes , Mulder . There 's someone I wanna talk to again . - Who ? - Kevin 's father . Why ? He knew Kevin was in danger . He warned us about a powerful and respected man . - The man 's a nut case . - Maybe he is . If Kevin is in danger , even if his father knows anything about Gates , it doesn 't help us now . Well , it 's not doing us a lot of good standing around here . So this is the man who took my son . You 've never seen him before ? No . Why would anyone want to hurt Kevin ? What does he want ? You really don 't know ? I ... I 'm sorry . I 'm just a little foggy right now . Scully . Haloperidol. lt 's a powerful antipsychotic . They 've increased his dosage . Mr Kryder , you said something before about coming full circle to find the truth . What does it mean ? Full circle to find the truth . I don 't know. I just can 't remember . Scully ! They had a sighting of Gates . He tried to rent another car at the airport under the name of Forau again . - Did you hear what I said ? - Mulder , look . Arrows that form a circle . Full circle to find the truth . Gates 's company owns a recycling plant near here . - He 's taken Kevin there . - He 's at the airport . If he hasn 't killed Kevin , he 's getting as far away as he can . I don 't think so , Mulder . You think it 's you , don 't you ? You think you 've been chosen to protect Kevin . I don 't know . Look , if I 'm wrong , I 'll meet you out at the airport , OK ? The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon will turn to blood ... because of you , son . is that why you wanna hurt me ? It 's not a question of wanting . You have to die , Kevin . For everyone . For the new age to come . You understand that , don 't you ? The others were all false prophets . You are the only true one among the 12 . Stop ! Federal agent ! I 'm armed ! Let him go ! Let him go and we 'll talk about it . There 's nothing to talk about . I was called upon ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Let me go ! No ! Kevin . Come on . Pull up . I knew you 'd come . You all set ? Thanks . Maybe I 'll see you again sometime . You will . - You all ready , Kevin ? - Yeah . - You OK ? - Yeah , I think so . We got two hours before our flight. I said we 'd make a statement about Gates 's death . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd handle that alone , Mulder . I have an errand I need to run . OK . I 'll see you at the airport . Bless me , Father , for l have sinned . It has been six years since my last confession . And ... since then I have drifted away from the Church . I 'm not sure why exactly . Have you come to confess ? No . There 's a man that I work with , a friend , and usually I 'm able to discuss these things with him . But not this . Father , do you believe in miracles ? Of course. I see them every day . The rising sun , the birth of a child ... No , I 'm ... I 'm talking about events that defy explanation . Things that ... I believe helped me to save a young boy 's life . But now I wonder if I saw them at all , if I didn 'tjust imagine them . Why do you doubt yourself ? Because my partner didn 't see them . He didn 't ... he didn 't believe them . And usually he ... he believes without question . Maybe they weren 't meant for him to see . Maybe they were only meant for you . is that possible ? With the Lord , anything is possible . Perhaps you saw these things because you needed to . To find my way back ? Sometimes we must come full circle to find the truth . Why does that surprise you ? Mostly itjust makes me afraid . Afraid ? Afraid that God is speaking , but that no one 's listening . Visiontext Subtitles : Sarah Emery I made this . US english

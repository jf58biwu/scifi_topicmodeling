 All right , let 's shoot this , Marty . Hold it still . Hold it still , Sloan . I 'd like to see you hold it still . The sooner they pave over this swamp , the better . It 's not a swamp . You 're standing in a forest with indigenous plant and animal species you 're obviously too ignorant to appreciate . Mark it and give me another position . All right , let 's shoot this next one real carefully , Marty , 'cause this is where they 're going to put the Blockbuster . You 're a real moron , Sloan , you know that ? Tree hugger . You should be sad to see the demise of an ecosystem that 's lasted a thousand years . We all should be . Give me four feet to your left . I can 't . What do you mean , you can 't ? I mean , I can 't because it 's stuck . Then un-stick it . This is weird . Sloan ! Sloan ! Louis . Let Bo do the work . How 's he know how to find a possum ? Shh . Animals sense things that we can 't . It 's how they survive . So , is that how Bo knows how to hunt ? Yeah . Our ancestors were hunters , too , but most of us have lost those instincts . That 's why we need a little help . Dad , what 's that ? Surveyor 's equipment . Someone left his stuff out here . Stay close , Louis . What is it , Dad ? Dad ? Bo , come here , Bo . What ... Quiet . Listen to me . I want you to take Bo , and I want you to run straight home . - What 's the matter ? - I want you to run straight home and I don 't want you to stop for anything . Louis . - I just ... - You understand ? All right , go . Come on , Bo , come on ! Bo , no , no ! Come on , Bo , come on ! Come on , come on ! Last year was something of a personal revelation . We were doing an exercise called " team builders " where we were given two minutes to build a tower out of ordinary office furniture . When I stood on Mike 's shoulders and I put that electric pencil sharpener on top of the pile , we both knew we could never have done it alone . Kill me now . You ever been to one of these team seminars , Agent Scully ? Um ... I think I went to a constructive problem solving course when I first joined the Bureau . Oh , did you play that game where , um , you can 't use any negative words ? I couldn 't believe how hard it was not to use the word " but . " I 'm having that same problem right now . Have you ever been to a team seminar , Agent Mulder ? No . You know , unfortunately around this time of year , I always develop a severe hemorrhoidal condition . Well , it builds muscles you didn 't even know you had . Communication . That 's the key . Sorry , folks , it 'll be a few minutes . What 's going on , Officer ? Got a little situation , is all . Thank you , Jesus . Where 's he going ? Oh , excuse me . A-Are you from search and rescue ? No , I 'm sorry , I 'm not . I 'm just stretching my legs . They said they 'd have word for us about what happened to my husband . I need somebody to tell me what 's going on . Well , just slow down . I-I don 't know what you 're talking about . My husband , Michael- - he was teaching our son to shoot and he said the dog got spooked , and then he heard gunshots , and now they said they 've found a jacket with blood on it , but they won 't tell me - anything about my husband . - Okay , I 'll try to find out who 's in charge , all right ? Oh , thank you . Now where 's he going ? Hey , Stonecypher ! Take a look at this . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten ... This tree was here 20 years before Ponce de Le√≥n landed . We 're going to be late for the wine and cheese reception . Officer Fazekas ? Yes ? Can I help you ? My name is Fox Mulder . I 'm an agent with the FBI . FBI ? Who called you guys out ? Nobody . We just got stopped at your roadblock . It sounds like you had a shooting . Shots were reported , but we have no evidence of anyone being shot . Well , what do you have evidence of ? A survey team working these woods didn 't report in last night . We found one man 's bloody jacket pretty torn up , and this morning , a boy got separated from his father . Separated by what ? It looks , maybe , like some kind of animal attack . What kind of animal ? I 'm not sure yet . I followed good tracks for the two surveyors , but the trails became confused as they moved into the brush . There was a third set of tracks leading away I ... I couldn 't identify . Couldn 't identify as the surveyors ? As man or animal . Mulder ? Oh , just , uh ... H-Hold on a second . What about the boy 's father ? I tracked him all the way down to where he fired the shots . The ground 's rocky , but from the depressions in the underlying soil , I can tell you that he entered the bushes from over there where I pick up another set of tracks- - two distinctly different set of tracks that from the way the ground 's upset is probably where the man was attacked . But no other sign of him ? You have panther in these woods ? There 's panther , bear . But these tracks look like neither of those ? No , sir . You know of a good motel in the area ? Excuse me . I think we can handle this very well on our own . Thanks . Mulder ? We 've got this conference . - They 're waiting . - Yeah . How do I say this without using any negative words , Scully ? You want me to tell them that you 're not going to make it - to this year 's teamwork seminar ? - Yeah . You see that ? We don 't need that conference . We have communication like that unspoken . You know what I 'm thinking . Look . He 's all eaten away . How do you like that , eh ? He 's not coming back , is he ? Why would you say that ? Dad 's a good shot ... and if he hit what he was aiming at , he 'd be home by now . You got to be brave , Louis . We both got to be brave . We 'll find out more about it in the morning . Get some sleep now . It 's open . Who cut the cheese ? Since you won 't be making it to the conference . Mmm . Par-tay . However , I must remind you this goes against the Bureau 's policy of male and female agents consorting in the same motel room while on assignment . Try any of that Tailhook crap on me , Scully , I 'll kick your ass . Pop quiz . What animal will attack the strongest , leaving the weakest to escape ? The answer is none . Not one of the over 4,000 species native to North America will attack the strongest when the weak is vulnerable . And what does that have to do with anything ? It makes me think that what we 're dealing with here is no ordinary predator . I thought this was just a ploy to get out of the conference . I think what we 've stumbled upon here is something more than local authorities realize . The scenario described by that boy sounds to me like a primitive culling technique . Mulder , we 're in Western Florida . The closest thing to primitive down here is living in a beachfront retirement condo . Those woods are as old as anything in the South , and there 's 800 square miles of them . There 's no telling what 's alive out there . Where are you going ? I got to check something out . You know , Mulder , sometimes I think some work on your communications skills wouldn 't be such a bad idea . I 'll be back soon , and we can build a tower of furniture . Okay ? What is it , Bo ? Mom ? It 's all right , Louis . You go back to sleep now . Bo ? Bo ? Bo , where 'd you get to ? Bo , is that you ? Come on , boy . Let 's go back in . All right , all right , you ... stay there the night . Louis ? Louis ! Louis ! Louis ! Louis ! Mom ! Louis ! What is it , Louis ? It 's in the house . I 'll be right back . How 's the boy ? He 's still freaked out . I think I might have some insight into this invisible creature he said was chasing him . The Invisible Man was invisible . Right . Yeah , he said he was chased by a creature with glowing red eyes . Let me show you something . Mrs. Asekoff said she went outside with the dog , but when she came back , the door was locked from the inside . And ? Look at this . We got some tracks here . Where ? Here ... and here- - dried mud against the tile tracked in from the outside . That could have been brought in by the dog . No , no . You see the ball of a foot here ? A large foot , and I count five toes . Wait a minute . I thought you said it wasn 't human . Well , I 'm not saying it is . The weight distribution is all wrong . People walk heel to toe . Whatever this thing is , it walks on the ball of its foot . You 're putting me on . No . My dad and I were Indian guides . I know these things . So , if it 's not man and it 's not animal , what the hell is it ? Guess I 'm a little late to this dance . I found some tracks- - right here . Same as I saw before . Where was that ? In the woods . Weight distribution is strange . They appear to be human , but whoever left these uses the balls of his feet , more like an animal . Well , whatever it is- - it 's attacked three grown men presumably in broad daylight , disposing of its prey without detection . And it wasn 't shy last night about coming out of the woods to try again . What we 've got here is a predator with low visibility and a high degree of motivation . And it 's got one advantage we don 't have : the entire Apalachicola National Forest . Then how do you stop it ? By identifying it- - finding it before it finds somebody else . It 's called a FLIR , for Forward-Looking Infrared . It was developed for chopper pilots in Vietnam- - detects body heat at 300 yards . That 's pretty sophisticated for government issue . I see you two have met . Jeff 's our local tech head . Some people prefer searching with dogs . I prefer an extra pair of hands if I get in trouble . Are we ready to go here ? Once we start in , you can put away your cell phones . The only communication in these woods is with short-wave radios , so stay close . Maintain visual contact . If you get lost , initiate oral contact . That means holler . If nobody responds , sit down , don 't move . I will find you . Don 't go looking for me . I know it sounds obvious , but folks still get lost . Okay . I get you . Thank you . All right . Local PD has all their resources looking out for a transient- - a drifter who 's wanted for a double homicide in Gadsden , Alabama . They were amused when I told them what we were doing . I don 't think it 's a drifter , Scully , and we may be looking for two individuals . Why do you say that ? Well , that thing lured that woman out of the house last night to separate her from her son . But for what purpose ? Divide and conquer . If your enemy has greater numbers than you , you divide and conquer to diminish those numbers . What enemy would that be ? Encroaching development . That 's what I suspected when I went to check on Louis and his mother . You think this is about a housing tract ? That survey team was staking out a new 100,000-acre plot . Civilization is pushing very hard into these woods . Maybe something in these woods is pushing back . Anything ? No . No , nothing at all , not even wildlife . Isn 't that a little strange ? Yeah . This forest is usually alive with sound . I 'm not , like , an expert , but I 've never seen it like this before . It sure is beautiful though . That 's what happens- - people get to looking around , next thing they know , something eats them . What do you think killed those men ? Nature is populated by creatures either trying to kill something they need to survive or trying to avoid being killed by something that needs them to survive . If we become blinded by the beauty of nature , we may fail to see its cruelty and violence . - Walt Whitman ? - No . When Animals Attack on the Fox network . Wait . I 've got something . It 's about 20 yards ahead . Where ? I don 't see it . It 's just sitting there . It 's on the move ! It 's moving fast ! It 's going to the right ! Wait , wait ! There 's two of them now . They 're moving in opposite directions . There and there . Where is it ? ! It 's about 40 yards ahead of you ! I don 't see it . Now it 's gone . I don 't know where it went . What is it ? I don 't know . They 're trying to separate us- - pull us away from the others . Let 's go back . Michele ? ! Michele ? ! Geez . Mulder , I need help ! Mulder ! Scully ! Over here ! Scully ? ! Over here ! What happened ? I don 't know . Where 's Fazekas ? She was walking right ahead of me . She was right here , and then she was just gone . I 'm getting no reading . What the hell 's happening here ? They separated us . That was on purpose . They divided us so they could go after her . She was in the lead and presumably the strongest . They take the strongest first . Take them where ? That doesn 't make any sense . - You can 't just disappear out here . - You 're right . - We got to find her . - How we gonna do that ? I don 't know . We 'll form a line and beat the bushes . Maybe you 'll pick up a signal . No , we need help . We need manpower . That 's not going to work out here . We need to get out of here . Listen to me ! The longer we wait , the less chance we have of finding her . This is nuts . This is loony tune , man . We got to go back out of these woods before it gets dark . Okay , you 're right . You go back . You leave me the FLIR , and you go back . We got to go together . We have to find her . Yeah , but if we stay here , they may not find any of us . Mulder , he 's right . We weren 't prepared for this . We have no way of telling them where we are . We don 't have any food , Michele had our only water . Look , I 'd like to find her , too , but I think the risks of that are just way too foolish . All right , we all go then . You lead the way . I don 't have much faith that this device will do us any good . So far , all it 's done is split us up . Whatever it is that we were chasing did show up on the screen at first . What does that tell you ? - Nothing . - Mm-hmm . Except that we 're going in the right direction . Maybe it can regulate its temperature . Do you know of any animal that can ? Ticks . I 've heard that they can halt their metabolism for up to 18 years , essentially going into suspended animation until something warm-blooded comes along . That 's interesting . Why is that interesting ? 30 years ago , the , uh , the town of Point Pleasant , West Virginia , was terrorized for over a year by something- - killing livestock , terrorizing the people . Witnesses described them as primitive-looking men with red , piercing eyes . Became known as the " Moth Men . " I 've got an X File dating back to 1952 on it . What would that be filed next to- - " The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati ? " No , " The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati " is in the C 's . " Moth Men 's " over in the M 's . This isn 't the way . What do you mean ? Michele always marks her route with little white stones . This is the same path . This is the way we came . I haven 't seen one of her stones for 20 minutes . That 's because you 've had your nose glued to that screen the whole time ! I 'm telling you , we 're on the wrong trail ! Somehow , we got off track . Oh , man , this is not happening . This is not happening . Everybody stand still . There 's something out there . Where ? About 40 or 50 yards out . Jeff ? Nothing . I saw it . The woods have gone silent again . - I got it . - Where ? - I got it on my screen . - Where ? About 30 yards ahead . It 's just sitting there . What is he doing ? Talk to him . This is not a good idea . Talk to him , Jeff ! Uh , go to your right . It just disappeared . Mulder , it 's not on the screen . Scully , I lost it ! I got it . Did you hit it ? I don 't know . It just stopped . Where 's Glaser ? How many shots did you fire ? Six , maybe seven . Is that your only clip ? Yep . Don 't fire again unless you 're sure you 're going to hit it . It may be trying to spend our advantage . What the hell is it , Mulder ? I don 't know . But whatever it is , it 's smarter than us- - at least out here . Mulder ? Mulder ! Scully ! Scully ! Mulder ! Scully ! You okay ? You were an Indian guide . Help me out here . Indian guide says maybe you should run to the store and get some matches . I would , but I left my wallet in the car . What are you doing ? I 'm trying to open my gun . If I can separate the shell from the casing , maybe I can get the powder to ignite . Oh . And maybe it 'll start raining weenies and marshmallows . Do I detect a hint of negativity ? No . Yes ... actually . Yeah . Mulder , you need to keep warm . Your body 's still in shock . I was told once that the best way to regenerate body heat is to crawl naked into a sleeping bag with somebody else who 's already naked . Maybe if it rains sleeping bags , you 'll get lucky . You ever thought seriously about dying ? Yeah , once . When I was at the Ice Capades . When I was fighting my cancer ... I was angry at the injustice of it . And it 's meaninglessness . And then I realized that that was the struggle . To give it meaning . To make sense of it . It 's like life . I think nature is supremely indifferent to whether we live or die . I mean , if you 're lucky , you get 75 years . If you 're really lucky , you get 80 years , and if you 're extraordinarily lucky , you get to have 50 of those years with a decent head of hair . I guess it 's like Las Vegas . The house always wins . Oh ! ‚ô™ Ta-da . ‚ô™ Go , girl . Hey , who did you identify with when you were a kid ? Wilma or Betty ? I identified with Betty 's bustline . Yes . I did , too . Could never have been married to Barney though . The kids were cute . Yeah . But where are they today ? Moth Men ? Really ? Yeah . But there seem to be only two of them . I don 't want to wrestle . Get over here . I 'm going to try and keep you warm . Sorry . One of us has got to stay awake , Scully . You sleep , Mulder . If you get tired , you wake me . I 'm not going to get tired . Why don 't you sing something . No , Mulder . If you sing something , I 'll know you 're awake . Mulder , you don 't want me to sing . I can 't carry a tune . Doesn 't matter . Just sing anything . ‚ô™ Jeremiah was a bullfrog ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Was a good friend of mine ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Never understood a single word he said ‚ô™ ‚ô™ But I helped him drink his wine ... ‚ô™ Chorus . ‚ô™ Joy ... to the world ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All the boys and girls ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Joy to you and me ... ‚ô™ Scully ? ! Mm ... over here ! What are you doing ? I 'm looking for food . I found some wild berries . I wouldn 't go far . Mulder , you never left my sight . Scully ? Scully ? Scully ? Scully ! I 'm down here . Where ? I fell down a hole ! You all right ? Yeah . I landed on soft dirt ... kind of . What 's down there ? I don 't know . It 's pretty dark . Oh ! Scully , what 's going on ? You okay ? I found Michele . Is she alive ? Not for much longer . Mulder , we have to get her out of here . Is there a way out ? I don 't know . I ... I 'm in some kind of a chamber . There 's ... It 's like ... some kind of network . Mulder ? Yeah ? I 'm not alone . I don 't have my weapon ! Mulder ? ! Hold on , I 'm going to drop my gun down . Geez ! Mulder , are you okay ? Don 't mind me . Scully ! Mulder , look . There has to be a scientific explanation for this . Too bad we don 't have any office furniture . If they could see us now . Go , team . 20 more bodies and we 'll win the honey-baked ham . Agent Mulder ! We 're down here ! We 're down here ! What are you doing down there ? We 've got injured people down here . We need a ladder . Right away . Hey , over here ! I love you . Dad 's going to be okay . He 's going to be okay . He 's going to be fine . I 'm just going to say good-bye . Well , we just got all the thanks when you did all the work . No , on the contrary , Agent Kinsley . We would 've never gotten involved in this if not for you . Really ? Yeah . You see this ? Oh , yeah , I pointed that out to Agent Stonecypher on the drive down . There was something in the cave that Scully fell into , an inscription : ad noctum . That 's Latin ... Yeah , it means " into darkness . " The Spanish conquistadors used to carve it on the posts that they would lash the natives to as a warning . So , who are you saying wrote this ? Ponce de Le√≥n came here 450 years ago looking for the Fountain of Youth . You mean , you think that these ... that-that body , the one that Agent Scully shot ... ? No . After 400 years in the woods , don 't you think they might have adapted perfectly to their environment ? You 're just making this up . Why do you say that ? 'Cause you work on the X Files , and you just want to write off your motel . Search and rescue are still unable to find Jeff Glaser or the second predator that you reported . I wouldn 't be surprised if they couldn 't find either one of them . Agent Mulder , I 'm confused . Why would they come after the boy in the house that night ? These predators have been in these woods for a long , long time . They would 've perceived any encroachment on their territory as an enemy , even a little kid like that . But that would mean that they 'd come after any one of us that had gone into the woods , wouldn 't it ? Where 's Agent Scully ? Oh , she got a lift back to the motel to pack up both your things . She did ? Excuse me . My jacket 's in that car . Scully ? ! Scully ! Mulder , what 's going on ? Let 's get out of here . Okay . You pack everything ? Yeah . I made this !

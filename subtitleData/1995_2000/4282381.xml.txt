 I want a list of people who are on that bus with Jarod . The uh ... bus company says they can 't disclose passenger identification . The bus company says . You are truly pitiful . Well , yeah , they have certain privacy regulations , there 's a certain protocol that we have to follow . Daddy ? Daddy ? Well , are you gonna invite me in ? - Hello ? - Of course . Hello ? Miss Parker ? Come in . I like what you 've done with the place . Your mother would love it . Oh , that is special . Is that new ? It was a gift when I graduated college from you . You remember . When you were ten years old . You 'd just come home from your first piano recital . What was the name of that piece you played ? " For Elise " . Bach 's Minuet in G. - Daddy what are you ... - Oh she was so beautiful , like you . I wish people would remember your mother the way she really was . They always taint her memory with lies . Lies ? Yeah , the kind Jarod perpetuates about her , about me . The truth about Mum is in my heart . Nothing can change that . Daddy ? Why are you here ? Well , bad dream . I was awake all night . I just ah ... make sure you are alright . Bach 's Minuet in G ? I would love to hear you play that again . - You sure it was her father ? - Yeah . Strange that Mr Parker would go back to that house after all these years . Typically unpredictable . Working hard I say . Miss Parker . Oh , this came for you . I hear your father came to visit . - Would you like to talk about it ? - Does it look like I want to talk about it ? Dover Town Bank ?

Now ! You have something to say , Sister ? Nothing you want to hear . Keep that way . Alright everybody up , move over here . Come on ! It 's not too late to stop this . Tell him that . Now shut up and move ! This is Lieutenant Roll . I want SWAT snipers deployed to all buildings across the street and surrounding the bank . I did that , Lieutenant .

How was it that this guy is still alive and I didn 't know about it ? Well I guess that Daddy keeps some secrets from you . Did he tell you about those letters ? I 'm sure he didn 't know about them . Oh that would be a stretch considering I stole them from his strongbox . I 'm afraid I woke him up . When ? Last night . Why are you here ? Well , bad dream . I was awake all night . Hey , you think a man with as much to lose as your father would have a better home security system . You are lying . Ask him about that little gift I left for him . Are you sure it was Jarod ? He took some of Catherine 's things and some of mine and left this behind . Jarod is rubbing our noses in it . Whose phone is that ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Miss Parker ? - Hello ? - Give it . Miss Parker ? Parker ? It 's Broots . It 's Broots . Can you hear me ? Hello ? Hello ? Watches and wallets , come on , give it up . Put it in the bag . Jude .

Alright . Get up . - What ? - Get up ! What are you doing , Clavell ? Getting us out of here . Come on . Come on . Two armed robbers have entered the Dover Town Bank . We do know gunshots have been fired and hostages have been taken . She never hung up the phone so I was able to triangulate the signal . And called the Dover Police , they told me about the robbery . Then I called Mr Parker 's office , but nobody 's got back to me . We need to go to Dover . - Without a directive from upstairs ? Sydney , forget it . - Miss Parker is not just a colleague , Broots . She is a friend . Just a minute , a situation is developing . One of the robbery suspects is emerging from the bank with a hostage at gunpoint . Sydney , is that who I think it is ? I want a helicopter to the airport and I want a plane waiting on the runway ! Oh , boy . You got one hour to set it up or people start to die ! Where is this ? Dover . Dover Town Bank ? Round up your group . " April 13th 2 AM . We failed to rescue Timmy . " No ! Raines had already destroyed that sweet little boy . Raines , what are you going to do with Timmy now ? There is no Timmy any more . They 'll call him Angelo now . " We plan to rescue Jarod tonight and tomorrow you and I will be on our way to a better place . " " All my love , Mum . " Going somewhere ? Apparently not . There is no smoking here . Call a cop . I need the key to the outer vault door . Dad , give it to him . Dad ? This your daughter , Frank ? You stay away from her . Okay , dad . She sure is a peach though . Your mother should be shot for sending you here . If you cared about me , she wouldn 't have asked me to do this . That 's what she said ? I don 't care about you ? She is telling you lies . Lies . Yeah , the kind Jarod perpetuates about her , about me . The parents lying to their children . Now where have I heard that one before ? My father had his reasons for keeping those letters from me . Like he had his reasons for saying that your mother 's death was a suicide ? But if you really believe that why are you so hell bent on finding out what Mr Fenigor has to say ? Combo to the vault cage ? Only the senior manager has it . He 's not in today . How are you doing , sweetie ? Why don 't you pick on somebody your own size ? Why don 't I put a bullet through your brain ? I can open the vault . What are you ? Some kind of handyman ? Just versatile . You know there 's another way out of here . One with less bloodshed , specifically yours . What are you talking about ? There is a vent that leads down to a main sewer line . It leads right out of here . Then how do you know that ? I studied the blueprints before I came in here . You 're not the only one who 's on the run . So you 're a handyman and a fugitive architect ? You are versatile . Now open it . That 's very good . Let 's go . Tell the cops to bring us something to eat , I 'm starving . You are always starving . Get in there . Give me a bag . Come on . Keep an eye on . Mr. Fenigor . My name is Jarod . Do you remember me ? Should I ? I was one of the children that you and Catherine Parker tried to rescue from the Centre . You tried to help me once . Please . Help me now . I , I don 't knwo what you are talking about . You are the only person who can help me find out who my parents are . Look you are being held against your will , you feel trapped and you feel terrified . I lived my entire life that way , please , help me . You and her together ? It 's complicated . - You don 't know what you 're asking of me . - I am asking you to honour Catherine Parker 's memory . Please tell me who my parents are . Help me find out who I am . I can 't . Please . - I can 't . I 'm sorry . I just can 't . - Mr. Fenigor . No . No . Hey . I have to help him . I didn 't shoot him so he could be helped . - Clave . - Not now , Jude . Hey , hey , hey ! It 's one thing to defend yourself against an armed bank guard . It 's another thing to shoot an innocent man in the back . If this man dies , so do you . In the electric chair . The bullet punctured his lung . He 's drawing in air from the exit wound . - I need hand towels and I need some soap . - In the bathroom . Details at this time are sketchy , however another shot was just heard from inside the bank . I 'm going to make my way to the SWAT commander now for confirmation . Don 't you die on me . I need a plastic bag and I need some tape . I 've got a bag . We have to seal the wound or he won 't be able to breathe . Cut off strips about this long . Apply constant pressure to the wound like this . - I have to get him to a hospital . - Nobody goes anywhere ! Maybe we should do it . It 's just one guy . Nobody goes anywhere ! Find me something to elevate his legs . He 's diaphoretic . His pulse is thready and he 's bleeding internally . I can stabilize him for a while but we need to get him to surgery . What the hell am I doing here ? - How does it feel to be the prey instead of the predator ? - Well you wouldn 't be the prey if you get back to the Centre where you belong . Oh , nice ! Fitting . You are so willing to ruin my life . Is your father 's validation that important to you ? I 'm standing here with Christy Isaac whose daughter Kaylee is a hostage inside the bank . Christy ? Please don 't hurt my daughter . She 's all I have . Mum . Kaylee , Kaylee , I love you . Frank , please take care of her . It 's difficult for little girls to figure out their fathers , isn 't it ? What ? You give your loyalties to a man who fills your head with lies . - Lies about those letters , lies about Fenigor . - And I suppose my loyalty should go out to you . - And what would you do if Fenigor confess that it was your father who killed your mother ? - He did 't . He loved her . You are so sure of that , aren 't you , Miss Parker ? It appears to me that the police seem to be mobilising for a possible assault on the bank . Everybody into the vault . Let 's go . How is he doing ? He is stable , for now . How well do you know him ? Comes in every Friday to pull cash out of his trust account . Does he ever come in to make deposits ? His account is funded by an outside source . Some company from Blue Cove . So the Centre is paying Fenigor to keep quiet . Question is who ? And quiet about what ? Over here , Broots . Anything ? No . Police , locals , no one I recognize . Maybe we are the only ones who know that Jarod is here . Think again . It 's Gar and another of Raines ' guys . They 're not the only ones . That 's Sam . This place is crawling with Sweepers . We need to figure out what Raines is up to . I 'll follow Sam . You follow the others . Wait , wait , wait , Sydney . Oh God , what am I doing here ? I must be out of my mind . What are they doing ? Working on escape plan B. " April 13th , 7AM . " " I have a bad feeling about the people surrounding me . " " If I can just get through this tonight , " " we 'll be on our way to a better place . " " All my love , Mum . " I know it 's not easy reading those letters . Look I broke into your father 's house , trying to find something about my past , but instead I found out about yours . Your mother deserved a better fate than what she got . You 're damn right she did . She used to send me letters on my birthday , holidays . I never knew about these . My father paid me a visit this morning . Talking about how you taint the memory of my mother with lies . And you believed him . Daddy . I have to go to the bathroom . - Hold it . - I cannot . These men are crazy . I 'm not going to risk getting us both killed . Clave . What are you doing ? Your job . Clave . The kid has to use the bathroom , so do I. - Hold it . - Hey , give us a break , huh ? Jude . Thanks for what you did back there . When you got to go , you got to go . My Dad says that he wants to take care of me , but , but then he lies to me . Daddy . Why are you here ? Ah , bad dream . I was awake all night . I don 't know what to believe . Believe what 's in your heart . Come on . Jarod . Mr Fenigor , you 've been shot . Don 't try to move . You saved my life . I did what was needed to be done . Jarod . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I took you from your family . - I do want to let you know how sorry I am . - Mr Fenigor please . Tell me who my parents are . Is that the key to his safe deposit box ? - There might be something about my mother in there . - If there is , you 'll get it . Miss Parker , I brought you this far . I 'm not going to shut you out now . Fenigor , my mother called you her friend . You owe her . You owe the both of us the truth . Who killed my mother ? Who killed my mother ? Miss Parker , please , he can barely breathe . Who 's paying you off to keep it a secret ? - What 's happening to him ? - There must be blood around his lungs . I need some sort of tube to drain it out . I have a sports bottle on Daddy 's desk . Jude , Jude ! Jude , the old man can 't breathe . We need the water bottle that 's on the Manager 's desk . I don 't know . He 's gonna die if we don 't help him . I know you couldn 't do anything about that guard , but you can do something now . Just hang on , come on . Get back . Don 't Move ! Back off , or I drop little brother . I 've already shot two people . You think one more 's gonna make a difference ? No , please . Please don 't kill my father . What 's it gonna be ? Mr. Raines guy is in a SWAT uniform . He is right up there . The target must be Jarod . We have to take care of the sniper before he shoots Jarod . Well , don 't look at me . I can 't even squash a bug , Sydney . Then guard the alleyway . Don 't let anyone follow . Are you up to this , Broots ? No , but it 's never stopped me before . Sydney , Mr Raines would like to see you . You won 't be needing that . What the hell were you doing in there ? She said the old guy needed help . Help ? I need help . You pull something like that again , you 're gonna end up just like the guard . Brother or not . You okay ? I wanna go home . Me too . Get away from her . What ? - She tried to save us . - You could have got us all killed . - It 's okay . - No , it 's not . - You do as I say . I 'm your father . - Oh yeah , since when ? You know , you can keep your money . I cannot believe Mum thought it would make a difference if I came down here . This is because of you . I can 't figure out if you 're ignorant or just stupid . - You listen to me . - No , you listen to me ! You think that little girl came down here today for money ? There is something here a lot more important to her than cash . And I feel real sorry for you if you 're too blind to see what that is . Miss Parker reached out to help someone . Spare me . Your mother would be very proud of you . You put on quite a show today . Sydney taught you well . Sydney taught me to believe that you can be anything you want to be . You should have known better than to come here without a directive . You should know better than to defy Tower policy by having Jarod assassinated . You 're in over your head , Sydney . Shoot him if he tries to leave . I 've made some mistakes . I don 't want to lose you . Mr. Fenigor ? You were my mother 's friend . Her confidant . Please tell me who killed her . He is not gonna tell me . Maybe he already has . Could you really do it , Gar ? Could you kill me if I stepped out of this car ? Yeah . Move the car , buddy . Thank you kindly Gar . Now do as the officer says , move the car . Fenigor 's deposit records . Transfer from the Centre Bank in Vinemy . Ten thousand dollars a month . Every month for the last twenty-eight years . Do you recognise the account number ? - No . - It 's your father 's . How do you know ? You 'd be surprised what I know about him . That 's it ? That 's it . What else does he know ? Apparently everything . Mr Fenigor . What secrets are in this envelope ? What is it ? It 's about prodigy . This is where you came from . Get me out of here and I 'll tell you everything . Both of you . What are you going to do with that dye pack egg ? Well . Handyman was right . There 's an access entrance to the main sewer line . We 're gonna get out of here , little brother . Come on . This is your lucky day , people . Thanks to Jarod 's brilliant escape plan none of you will have to die today . In spite of everything , it 's been a real gas . Well , at least we won 't starve . Give me that one . - What ? - Give it . Come on , Jude . Jude , what the hell are you doing ? Hurry up ! Help me with the old man ! Be careful with him ! Out , out . Hurry . Mind if I cut in ? I don 't like being locked up in little rooms . This is mine . Well , thank you , Jarod . Let 's get out of here . The crisis is over . The hostages are coming out of the bank now and the paramedics have gone in . Move , move , come on . Jarod . Mr Fenigor . Jarod . Mr Fenigor , why is my father paying you ? Is it about who killed my mother ? Jarod . Answer me . - In the red files . - Red files ? - Prodigy red files . - Prodigy . Freeze . All units , shooter second story 641 building across from the bank . Move . Please . You were right . Fenigor was in there . Did we get him ? Wounded . He is in an ambulance . I 'll take care of the details . Do you think he told her anything ? Nothing that can 't be denied . Are you alright ? Perfect . Where is Jarod ? He got away . Another failure . I 'm fine , daddy . Well ? Maybe you 'll sleep better tonight . " March 20th , 1970 . " " I am counting the days until our trip to Europe . " " How excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world . " " For now though my friend and I must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us . " " But I promise you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14th . " " All my love , Mum . " Daddy ? Am I still welcome here ? It 's late . Thank God you 're alright . I 'm sorry I didn 't say that earlier . You didn 't have to come all the way out here to tell me that . Oh yes , Angel , I did . See , I wasn 't entirely forthcoming with you this morning . Oh ? Truth is , somebody broke into my house last night . That 's terrible . I hope you didn 't lose anything valuable . Ah , nothing that can 't be replaced . I wish I 'd known earlier . I could have asked Jarod if he had anything to do with it . Hmm , well , I wanted you to know . Can 't have secrets between family now , can we ? Daddy ? How come that Center sniper shot that old man outside the bank ? Oh , tragic accident . Any idea who he was ? Not a clue . Get some rest , Angel . You sure earned it . What ? I never had a chance to say goodbye . How did you get away ? Escape plan B , remember ? The vent . How was it down there ? Let 's just say that I 'm hoping my next pretender isn 't as a sewer worker . Did you talk to your father ? He just left . He didn 't say it was you who broke into his home , didn 't say it wasn 't either . Fenigor ? I told him I didn 't know who he was . So you lied ? Like father like daughter . Jarod , we were so close to finding the truth . You 'll figure it out . And so will I. The question is , what becomes of us when we have all our answers ? That is the question . This is where you came from . " Bank " End Dictation : ± ¿ ± ¿ / ´ Ð ´ Ð

 We 're almost there . How you doin ' , hon ? Breathe deeply . Just like that . There ya go . You 're doin ' great . Yeah , real great . Ma 'am ? Ma 'am , I 'II need your full name and Social Security number . Amanda Nelligan . 545020809 . - And your insurance carrier ? - Atlantic Mutual . Is there anyone you need us to contact ? The father of the baby ? - I 'm not sure how to reach him . - Give me his name . I can try . He 's not from around here . - Is he from out of state ? - Another planet . AII right , we 're here now . Hold on . One more little push , Amanda . There you go . You 're gonna set a speed record here . Great . There 's a cute face . Bulb syringe . This is like the Indy 500 here . Here comes the shoulder ... Good . OK , Amanda . That 'II do it . - Oh , God . - What ? What is it ? It 's OK . She 's just fine . Perfectly healthy . No problem . Everything 's gonna be A-OK . You 've got a healthy baby girl . A little girl . Good Lord . Not another one . The photo 's a Iittle over the top , but what do you think , Scully ? - Not seriously . - Vestigial tails don 't interest you ? Caudal appendages . Fetuses have them . The coccyx enlarges to contain the spinal fluid , then shrinks as the child develops . Occasionally , it doesn 't . It 's extremely rare but it has been known to happen . Five times in the Iast three months ? In a town with a population of less than 15,000 people ? I 'd say that 's more than a statistical anomaly . So would I. No , Mulder , I think you 're right . I think that something about this warrants investigation . Only not by us . I 'd say that it 's a job for the local health department . I called around . They 're already investigating . So what else about this interests you ? Could it be ... visitors from space ? The doctor said that my baby 's gonna be fine . She 's really healthy . And when she 's a few months old , it 's just a matter of " snip . " - That 's good to hear . - Yeah . Did you experience any unusual complications during your pregnancy ? Did you undergo any kind of fertility treatment ? No . I wasn 't trying to get pregnant . I guess you could just sort of say I 'm a single mom now . When you were admitted , you said that the baby 's father was from another planet . - What did you mean by that exactly ? - You know , that he 's not from this planet . Were you abducted ? No . He dropped by my apartment one day , and one thing sort of led to another . But the baby 's father is an alien . No . I didn 't say he was an alien . I said he was from another planet . His name is Luke Skywalker . He 's what 's known as a Jedi Knight . - Did he have a light saber ? - No , he didn 't bring it . He did sing his song for me , though . How many times have you seen Star Wars ? Three hundred and sixty-eight . I should break 400 by Memorial Day . OK . Thank you . Wait a minute , wait . You know these four other babies that were born around here with tails ? There couldn 't be any chance Luke 's the father , is there ? OK . AII right . I got it . Thank you . Take your best shot , but I think there 's more going on here than Luke Skywalker . I think you 're right , Mulder . Are you coming ? Here are the PCRs we ran for the five children . We put calls in to the parents . We 'II blood-test all the husbands this afternoon . - Good . - They 'II be none too happy . I have to confess , this answer seems so strangely obvious , I probably wouldn 't have even checked for it . What answer ? You see here , these identical band-trait matches , all showing a small loss of a part of chromosome number eight ? Each of these five children , born to five different women , all share the same father . I should 've thought of it sooner . This kind of birth defect is often passed on in a family . Meaning the father had a tail as well ? Though he most likely had it surgically removed along the way . How would this happen ? Birds and bees and monkey babies . Birds do it , bees do it , even educated MDs do it . AII five of these women shared the same ob-gyn , didn 't they ? Yeah . He 's the only one in town . Four of the five women , the married women , not including Amanda Nelligan , are on record as receiving insemination therapy as a means of conception . The doctor might have something to do with it ? So much for not putting all your eggs in one basket . We should find the best lawyer . I plan to sue . That 's all I 'm saying , Fred . Babboo , Iet me do the talking . I 'II handle this . Just tell him we 're gonna sue . You too , huh ? - What the hell did you do ? - What did you do ? I didn 't do anything . We 're gonna figure this out . Look , everybody , just relax . Don 't you tell me to relax . What the hell happened to my sperm ? - Mine too . - Whose did you use ? It 's bad enough having a boy with a tail . Then you find out it 's not even yours . For God 's sake , alton , how many of us are there ? I 'm Special Agent Mulder with the FBI . This is Agent Scully . - Great . Arrest this son of a bitch . - Settle down . Nobody 's gonna be arrested . - We 're here to find out what 's goin ' on . - AIton didn 't use my sperm . I most certainly did . Each of you women was inseminated with your husband 's own sperm . Why was it necessary to inseminate in these cases ? It was a sperm-motility issue . The intrauterine process I used has about a 40 percent chance of success . I was surprised . It seemed to work all four times . - The only thing I can think of is ... - What ? - Maybe it never worked at all . - What are you saying , alton ? I wanna know what he means by that . I haven 't been with a man since 1989 . I mean , not counting you , honey . I 'm not accusing anyone of anything . I 'm just saying , my latest patient who gave birth to a baby with a tail ? She didn 't undergo insemination . So you are blaming the wrong baby doctor . Hey . Hey . Excuse me . I 'm an agent with the FBI . I 'd Iike to ask you a few questions . Yeah , OK . Scully , check it out . Oh , my God . That 's him ? He 's the one ? Five out of five . They spelled my name wrong . It 's Van BIundht , with a silent h . - B-I-u-n-d-h-t . - We 'II get right on that . Lots of people spell it wrong . It 's , Iike , Dutch or somethin ' . - Can I go now ? - No . There 's a few things we have to clear up . Yeah . Like how 'd you do it ? What do you mean ? You 're the father of five children , Mr Van BIundht . Is that not news to you ? Do you have any insight into how five women came to be inseminated with your sperm ? - You make it sound so romantic . - You 're saying there was romance involved ? Why is that so hard to believe ? Just cos I was born with a tail , no woman would want me ? Maybe I got personality . You ever think of that ? You had sex with these women ? How is it that none of them have any recollection whatsoever of that happening ? Look , I 'm not saying anything one way or another . I 'm just sayin ' , hypothetically , if some women wanted to have kids and their husbands weren 't capable , and everybody was happy , and nobody got hurt , hypothetically , where 's the crime ? If you 're waitin ' for my usual theory as to what 's goin ' on , I don 't have one . I do . On behalf of all the women in the world , I seriously doubt this has anything to do with consensual sex . I think it involved some form of Rohypnol-rape . - The tranquilizer ? I didn 't think of that . - The " date rape " drug . High doses of it cause a loosening of inhibitions , memory loss . IfVan BIundht was able to slip the drug to these women , especially in conjunction with alcohol ... But when and where would he have had the opportunity ? He identified these women through his janitorial job . He could 've followed them anywhere , to a bar . Those women don 't look like the type to do a Iot of solo drinking . I think it 's enough to keep him in custody while we check it out . You spelled my name wrong . It 's B-I-u-n-d-h-t . Silent h . Address ? I strongly suggest you stop eyeballing ' me and tell me your address . 17 Prospect Parkway . Martinsburg , 25401 . AII right , Mr Van BIund-ht . Give me your phone number . What the hell ... ? The h is silent . I could 've sworn Curtis clocked out hours ago . He said good night to me . This morning I find him underneath the desk . Deputy , are you sure you don 't remember what happened last night ? The guy cold-cocked me . Except he wasn 't the guy . He was me . My head hurts . I found Van BIundht 's clothes in a locker . He must 've worn the deputy 's spare uniform . After hitting him over the head . I have a theory . Do you wanna hear it ? Van BIundht physically transformed into his captor , then walked out the door ? Should we be pickin ' out china patterns or what ? What about the simple answer ? With that blow to the head , the deputy might as well have identified McGruff the Crime Dog . - What about what the sheriff saw ? - Two men , same build , same coloring . Add the uniform , it explains how someone can mistake one man for another at 3am . My theory explains how four women could mistake Van BIundht for their husbands , and how Amanda Nelligan could think it was Luke Skywalker . We 've both seen something like this before . But what are you saying ? That Van BIundht is an alien ? Not unless they have trailer parks in space . No , this is something different . If you could be somebody else for a day , who would it be ? Hopefully myself . So boring . Wouldn 't you even be tempted to try somebody else 's existence for a day ? Live your life as somebody else ? Looking like someone else and being someone else are different things . Everybody else would treat you Iike you were somebody else . Maybe it 's other people 's reactions to us that make us who we are . AII right , then . eleanor Roosevelt . - You can 't be a dead person . - Why the hell not ? Because . What are you doin sneaking ' around my porch ? We 're with the FBI . Is this the home of Edward Van BIundht ? - That 's me . - We 're looking for your son , Eddie Junior . Eddie ? What did that moron do now ? Five women ? Oh , Lord ! Anything else ? Yes . He attacked a sheriff 's deputy during his escape from custody . - Hurt bad ? - Fortunately not . Well , thank heavens for that at Ieast . Sir , do you have any idea where your son might be ? I wish I did . I 'm sorry . I haven 't seen him for the Iast two days . Is this you ? One and the same . Hey , you wanna see ? No ! No . No , thank you . My son had his removed when he was just a kid . Kept buggin ' me and buggin ' me until ... until I finally let him do it . There you go . I told him it was a mistake . I said " Son , you ain 't much to look at , you ain 't no athlete and you sure the hell ain 't no Einstein , but at Ieast you got that tail . " " Otherwise , you 're just small potatoes . " But he didn 't listen . Does your son have any other unique medical conditions ? I mean , aside from the tail ? Mr Mulder , that boy was born sickly . We had this condition in the South called pellagra . Excuse me , sir , how did you know my name was Mulder ? - She told me it was . - No , actually , I didn 't . It 's him ! Pretty spry for an old guy , huh ? Eddie Junior , not Senior ? Whichever one he is , wouldn 't you say he 's a man with a secret ? Honey , what are you doing home so early ? Something 's wrong with Daddy . Fred ? Honey ? Fred , is everything OK ? Everything 's fine . What happened to the clothes you were wearing this morning ? I 'II explain later . Just give me a Iittle privacy , OK , Babboo ? OK . Sugar Patootie . I 'II check upstairs . - I 'm all right . - What ? It 's quicklime . Move back over there . Not so spry . Do you think the fall killed him ? Babboo , I 'm home . - Oh , crap ! - I 'm home early . What ? You were just here . - You went into the bathroom . - What ? What do you mean , I went into the bathroom ? Come here . Someone is in the bathroom . It 's all clear . So , what killed Eddie the Monkey Man ? It 's difficult to say . The quicklime burned the tissue even as it preserved it . So , what killed him is one of two things I haven 't figured out yet . - What 's the other thing ? - That would be this . Striated muscle tissue . - What 's unusual about that ? - In and of itself , nothing . - Where I found it , however ... - Where did you find it ? Everywhere . His entire body . This man has a thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue underpinning the entire dermal layer of his skin . That 's not normal . This man 's body is quite a scientific specimen . And thankfully , it 's preserved and intact . In other words , there are 654 muscles in the human body , and this man , essentially , has 655 . Could that somehow be related to his having a tail ? Possibly . It could be a linked gene birth defect . What would be the purpose of this muscle ? You got me , Mulder . You know , maybe none . It appears atrophied . although it may look that way as a result of the mummification . Could this be a " like father , Iike son " kind of a thing ? - What do you mean ? - Could Eddie Junior have the same anomalous muscular structure as his dad here ? Maybe . What are you suggesting ? If this musculature underlies the entire skin , maybe it could be utilized to remold the skin 's shape and texture . Which might explain why we 're looking for a man who can appear to be his own father . Isn 't it much more likely that this man simply has an identical twin ? - Check that out . - Where are you going ? Van BIundht 's MO confuses me . Four married women who wanted to get pregnant ... And one single woman who didn 't . Come in . - Sorry , Ms Nelligan . I 'm sorry to bother you . - No , it 's no bother . I just have a few additional questions I wanted to ask you . - OK . - Here we go , sweetie . Bye-bye . We 'II just come back later . I thought they were Iettin ' me stay here so long because I had really great insurance . Turns out they 're just keepin ' me here because they think I 'm sort of crazy . They wanna make sure I 'm safe to be around my baby . Free cable . I wanna ask you , do you recognize this man ? Oh , yes . That 's Eddie Van BIundht . What can you tell me about him ? We went out all through high school . - OK , brother . - What ? Nothing . He 's just ... he 's sort of a loser . One of those guys you look back on and you go " Oh , my God , what was I thinkin ' ? What was I thinkin ' ? " Well , what specifically made him a loser ? I don 't know . Everything . He had , Iike , one million annoying personal habits . You know , just no sense of romance , no ambition , you know , no direction . I hear he 's , Iike , a janitor or somethin ' now . He had this weird family . His dad was in a circus or somethin ' . I don 't know . He never let me meet him , thank God . Well ... he must have had some good qualities . Well , yeah , sure . Everybody 's got a few . We had some good times . He loved Star Wars so we used to go and see it every weekend . That was nice . He was no Luke , that 's for sure . Why do you wanna know about Eddie ? That 's official FBI business . I wanted to congratulate you on this blessed event . Thank you . " May the force be with you . " Hello there . - I 'm here to see Amanda Nelligan . - Just down the hall there . Come in . No , seriously , though , why do you wanna know about Eddie ? - What about Eddie ? - Why were you asking me those questions ? - Mulder . - This is Fred Niemann . Is it OK for us to get into our bathroom now ? Excuse me , sir ? I was hoping we could get into our bathroom this evening . You said the police were gonna dust it for fingerprints , but that was four hours ago . We wanna help you catch this guy , but I 'm having a real hard time here . How exactly do you wind up chasing the suspect into my bathroom ? - Don 't forget the suit . - What do you need with my charcoal suit ? I 'm sorry , Mr Niemann . I 'm gonna have to call you back . I was just here . Where did I go ? There was a man . He looked exactly like me . Did you see where he went ? Down the hall . - Men 's locker room . - Thank you . - Hey . - Hey . - Van BIundht . - Who ? Don 't think about it . Get your hands up . Turn around . Keep ' em up there . Put your hands down now . If it 's not you , I apologize in advance . What are you doing ? Pull your pants up . What ? What did I do now ? - You 're the only ones here ? - Yeah . I apologize . Only one of you is the man I 'm looking for . I hope . I gotta wait for some blood tests and then I 'II release the other one . So just sit tight and relax . Keep your clothes on , huh ? - Scully . - Hey , it 's me . Get down to the hospital right away . - I 'm on my way . - Good . You 're a damn good-Iooking man . You drew a gun on me . You handcuffed me . With my own handcuffs . I 'm sorry . I don 't understand . Do we look like criminals ? - What was on your mind ? - I said I was sorry . - Am I done here ? - Yeah . We got his description . - Come on , guys . - What the hell happened ? Van BIundht surprised me . He cold-cocked me and then he got away . - Got a lead on him ? - No , but the authorities are on the warpath for goin ' after one of their own . They 'II catch him eventually . So , what ? That 's it for us ? I know I dragged you out here , but I 'm beginning to think this is just a waste of time . Now you think there 's no X-File here ? No . No . I think the only thing that 's here is small potatoes . Hello ? Hello ! Get me outta here ! Hello ! Hello ! I 'm down here ! Help ! Help ! Which one of you wrote this ? I did , sir . You spelled Federal Bureau of Investigation wrong . It was a typo . Twice . Agent Scully , did you establish a cause of death ? Yes , sir . Edward Van BIundht Senior died of natural causes . Specifically heart disease and advanced age . We think the son hid the father so he could continue to cash in on the old man 's Social Security checks . - Most likely . - So , the son wasn 't a murderer . - No , not at all . - But he was a rapist . I entered him into the sex offenders ' database . The West Virginia State Police have a photo and will coordinate with local authorities . There should be an arrest soon . That about wraps it up . So , Scully , what are you doin ' tonight ? Any big plans ? As it 's Friday , I was thinking I could get some work in on that monograph I 'm writing for the penology review . Diminished acetylcholine production in recidivist offenders . - Actually , I might bag that , though . - Really ? Yeah . The anomalous musculature in the corpse we found really has me intrigued . In fact , I think I 'II go to Quantico and have some tissue samples run . I 'II see you Monday . Monday morning . " Fox " ? Brother ! Good night ! This is where my tax dollars go ? Where do I Iive ? Where the hell do I sleep ? Mulder ? Langly . You gotta see this . An associate of ours has figured out a way to digitize the Zabruder footage so he can get a bird 's-eye view of Dealey Plaza at the moment of the assassination . You won ' t believe where the 3rd shot came from . Tell him about the cheese steaks . We 're goin ' out for cheese steaks . Are you down with that ? Erase this once you hear it . Geeks for friends . Marty , it 's Chantal . It 's been so long since we 've spoken . And I 've been so lonely not hearing your sexy voice . Just for you , we 've lowered our rates to 40 cents a minute , two ninety-nine for the first minute , all long-distance rates apply . Do give me a call , lover man . I 'll be waiting . FBI . F ... B ... I. FBI . You lookin ' at me ? There ain 't nobody else here . You must be lookin ' at me . You wanna piece of this ? You 're a damn good-Iookin ' man . - Mulder , what 's up ? - Scully ... Is this a bad time ? No . No , I 'm ... Come on in . Who 's that for ? Us . OK , have a seat . So , what are you workin ' on ? More autopsy data . Everyone at the lab found Mr Van BIundht pretty fascinating . We discovered an additional anomaly relating to the hair follicles in his scalp . I can 't even begin to guess at the nature of it until we can run it through the transmission electron microscope . Sounds very interesting . Yes , it is . So , seriously , Mulder . What 's going on ? You OK ? I was just kinda knockin ' around , and was just thinkin ' ... It 's good . We never really ... talk much , do we ? What do you mean ? Like ... really talk ? No , no , we don 't , Mulder . Well , what 's stopping us ? So there we are , at two o 'clock in the morning , me in my taffeta dress and Marcus in whatever the hell it was he was wearing ... Thank you very much . It had a kelly-green cummerbund on it . Anyway , so I know that Marcus is thinking that it 's now or never . - And I 'm thinking ... - What are you thinking ? I 'm thinking , what is that siren I hear getting louder ? - No way . Who called the cops ? - It was the fire department . - My friend Sylvia and her idiot prom date ... - Burwood ? .. had built this campfire that went out of control . And so we all had to ride back on the ... What do you call it ? The pumper truck . Yeah . Marcus was the 12th-grade Iove of my Iife . I can 't believe I 'm telling you this . I don 't believe you haven 't told me before . Now I 'm seeing a whole new side of you , Mulder . Is that a good thing ? I Iike it . - Do you ever wish things were different ? - What do you mean ? The person you wanted to be when you grew up , when you were in high school ? - How far off from that did you end up ? - Careerwise ? Miles off target . Not just that . Do you ever wish that you could go back and do it all differently ? Do you ? Thanks for comin ' . What 's with the hat ? My therapist makes me wear it . She says it 's meant to bolster my self-esteem . Does it ? Not really . The other inmates beat me up and take it from me , which would be OK except every week she brings me a new hat . plus they keep me on some kind of muscle relaxant so I can 't make faces the way I used to . Did you tell them to do that ? Is Agent Scully here ? What did you wanna talk to me about , Eddie ? I just think it 's funny . I was born a loser , but you 're one by choice . On what do you base that astute assessment ? Experience . You should live a Iittle . Treat yourself . God knows I would , if I were you . Have a good day , sir . I don 't imagine you need to be told this , Mulder , but you 're not a loser . Yeah , but I 'm no Eddie Van BIundht , either , am I ? Subtitles by Visiontext I made this ! AMERICAN ENGLISH

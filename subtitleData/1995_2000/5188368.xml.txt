 In the late 20th century , hostile forces inside the United States grow strong . The city of Los Angeles is ravaged by crime and immorality . To protect and defend its citizens , the United States Police Force is formed . A Presidential candidate predicts a millennium earthquake will destroy L.A. in divine retribution . Like the mighty fist of God , Armageddon will descend upon the city of Los Angeles- - the city of sin , the city of Gomorrah , the city of Sodom- - and waters will arise and separate this sinful , sinful city from our country . An earthquake measuring 9.6 on the Richter scale hits at 12 : 59 P.M. August 23 in the year 2000 . After the devastation , the constitution is amended , and the newly elected President accepts a lifetime term of office . The country 's capital is relocated from Washington , D.C. , to the President 's hometown of Lynchburg , Virginia . Los Angeles Island is no longer part of the United States and becomes the deportation point for all people found undesirable or unfit to live in the new , moral America . The United States Police Force , like an army , is encamped along the shoreline , making any escape from L.A. impossible . From the southeastern hills of Orange County to the northwestern shore of Malibu , the great wall excludes L.A. from the mainland . The President 's first act as permanent Commander in Chief is Directive 17 : Once an American loses his or her citizenship , they are deported to this island of the damned , and they never come back . [ Alarm Sounding ] P.A. : Attention . We are on tactical alert . Remain at battle stations . I repeat , remain at battle stations . This is the Police channel , and this is Prime News . In a late-breaking story , the force has announced the arrival of the most notorious outlaw in United States history at Firebase 7 , the Deportation Center for Los Angeles Island . Now this on-the-scene report . Reporter : War hero . Criminal . The force 's most wanted man . Convicted of 27 moral crimes . Arrested 2 weeks ago on a charge of gunfighting for profit in New Vegas , Thailand , U.S. Territory . It 's been 16 years since his famous rescue in New York , and the reports of Plissken sightings have remained constant during that time . Commander ? I 'm still getting a trace from the rescue team , sir . Stationary signal ? It has not moved from this location . That means he 's hiding , captured , or dead . So we go with Plissken ? He 's all we 've got . Hello , Plissken . Welcome to L.A. Come on . Move it . That 's Snake Plissken ? What did you expect ? I don 't know . He just looks so retro . Kind of 20th-century . Good old days . Let 's get going . Reporter : The people of the United States have waited a long time for this criminal ... Soldier : Move out ! P.A. : You are now entering the Deportation Center . You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United States of America and sentenced to permanent expulsion beyond its borders . Any failure to comply with processing instructions will be met with use of force . Take a look at them , Plissken . Prostitutes , atheists , runaways ... We 're throwing out the trash . " S.D. Bob Plissken , Special Forces . " 2 Purple Hearts . Youngest man ever decorated by the President . Rescued a different President in ' 97 . So , what happened to you , war hero ? You were the best we had . Now you 're just like one of them . You had it all , and you turned away from your country . Why ? Huh ? The whole nation 's watching . Every good and decent person who works hard and follows the rules . Be my guest . What do you have to say , Plissken ? Call me Snake . P.A. : You are now entering the processing area . The next scheduled departure to L.A. is in one hour . Get over there ! P.A. : You now have the option to repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises . If you elect this option , notify the cleric sergeant in your processing area . [ Door Opens ] How 's it going , hotshot ? You know , I got to admit , I thought we had you in Cleveland . Come on . Tell me . How 'd you do it ? Get to the deal . What ? You need me for something . What is it ? Show him . At 10 : 30 hours Wednesday , a group of government officials began a tour of the Benford Space Defense Lab . The President 's daughter Utopia was among them . Somehow during the tour , she came into possession of a top-secret prototype unit . One hour later , she boarded Air Force 3 for Lynchburg . To the American people : Now is the time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror ! At 11 : 40 hours , she hijacked Air Force 3 . We scanned this onto the V.R. Check it out . Today is day one of a brand-new world . The days of empire are finished . To the President , my father : You know what 's in here , and unless you open your borders , allow all the wrongfully accused to return to their country , I will use this on you and on the United States . Her emergency escape pod landed somewhere in L.A. Her E.L.T. signal ceased immediately . After that , silence . We sent in a 5-man rescue team . Within a few hours of landing on the island , all but one of them was killed . Hell of a team . Skip the commentary , Plissken . Plissken : Snake . Call me Snake . Get on with it . Right after her sister committed suicide , Utopia began to withdraw from life into her virtual reality simulator . She 'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time . Somebody else was in there with her . Utopia made tapes of her V.R. experiences and then tried to erase them , but she missed one 5-second image . We ran a data scan and found this fragment on the end of her last tape . Cuervo Jones . Peruvian terrorist . Member of the Shining Path . Runs the Mescalito Justice , the biggest , baddest gang in L.A. Somehow , Cuervo Jones managed to tap into the V.R. master data bank . Utopia was lonely , looking for something to believe in , and so he used her to steal the black box . Sad story . You got a smoke ? This is serious , Plissken . The black box is a matter of national security . It looks like it belongs to Utopia 's lover-boy now . Yeah . We want it back . I 'll bet . What 's it do ? Top secret . Only on a need-to-know . Evidently , I don 't need to know , so fuck you . I 'm going to Hollywood . If you go into L.A. , bring back the black box , and you will receive a full pardon for every immoral act you have ever committed in the United States . Sounds familiar . An immediate answer . Yes or no ? Who are you ? I 'm your President . I understand you got some domestic problems . Put that black box in my hand , and you 're a free man . I can see you 're real concerned about your daughter . Utopia is lost to me . My daughter is gone . Last chance , hotshot . For what ? Freedom , sir . In America ? That died a long time ago . All right . I 've heard enough of this . Explain to this foot soldier why he 's going to do what we tell him to do . What 's he talking about ? The plutoxin 7 virus . Genetically engineered . 100 % pure death . Complete nervous system shutdown . You crash . You bleed out like a stuck pig . It 's not a pretty sight . I see . You figure you inject that shit into me and I 'll do whatever you want , just like New York , huh ? You got it , Snake . One question : Which one of you assholes gets to die trying to stick me ? You don 't understand . It 's already in you . Catches on quick , doesn 't he ? Computer : Your countdown clock is now activated . Designer viruses , Plissken . Wave of the future . Right now you 've got less than 10 hours to live . It 's already moving through your bloodstream . Go ahead . Put your hand on that touch pad . Of course , there is an antidote , and it neutralizes the virus immediately upon injection . Which I will personally authorize once your mission is completed . The man is too dumb to survive L.A. We 're holograms , Plissken . Give us a little credit . We 're not that stupid . Get this crap out of me . I guess we 've got a deal . [ Countdown Clock Beeping ] Nice to be working with you , hotshot . You 'd better hope I don 't make it back . All of you . Core burner . Magnesium ammo . 500 extra rounds . Oral projectile . Mouth dart . The dart is filled with urolyde . It will stun the enemy for several seconds . Every member of the rescue team had a tracking chip implanted in his arm . I think one of them might still be alive . Use the tracer in your watch to locate him . This is a holocam . It 's a portable holographic camera . It 'll project your image up to a haIf-mile away . 100 % audio send and receive capabilities . It 's a prototype . Confuse and deceive the enemy . It has a mini-nuke battery good for about 8 minutes , but you can only use it once . So you better save it for when it counts . Stick matches . Plain , old-fashioned stick matches . Never know when you might need them . Where are my guns ? I thought you might want those . Stealth clothing . Fire retardant , nullifies heat detection . Put them on . I 'll take the coat . You 'll take them all . All right . Listen up , Plissken . L.A. ' s being primed as a beachhead for an invasion of the United States . War is about to be deckared , Plissken , or didn 't you know ? Oh , that 's right . I forgot . You don 't give a shit , do you ? Cuervo Jones runs with Shining Path . Their goal is to take back North America . It 's the revenge of preindustrial societies . Shining Path has united all Third-World countries . The Cubans and Brazilians are poised to invade Miami . If the Ugandans and Colombians make a run at the border , we 've got a full-scale attack on the United States . High stakes , hotshot . Snake : How am I going in ? Under the San Fernando Sea . Shark 3 submarine . One-man submersible . Just like the turbine model , only this one 's nucIear-powered . It 's very simple . Throttle up , keep it in the green , throttle back . You 'll put ashore at the Cahuenga Pass . Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl . Use your tracer to locate the last member of the rescue team . If he survived , he 's the only source of information you 'll have on the island . Do I bring him back , too ? No . Negative . Figures . For all we know , he 's already dead . In any case , once you go inside , you 're on your own . When the black box is secure , get back to the submarine as fast as you can . It 's your only way out . Plissken ! You know what to do with the girl . This nation doesn 't need to waste any more time and money on bullshit trials for high treason . Kill her . Is that an order from the President ? Absolutely . Or let 's just say it 's what 's best for the country . By the way , who gives me the antidote ? A medical team will be standing by . Neither one of you ? No . Good . Ha ha ha ! Thought you might try that , hotshot . That 's why the first clip is loaded with blanks . Bye-bye , Snake . Good luck . Nice and easy now . Com check . Yeah . I 'm here . Stand by for launch . Computer : 8 hours , 8 minutes , 26 seconds to neurosystem shutdown . Ignitor . Fuel rod injection . She 's in the green . Lock fuel rods . Locked . Nuclear turbine to 75 % power . 75 % power . Hands on switches and counting . 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... launch . Hey , watch your speed , hotshot . There 's lots of obstructions down there . [ Alarm Beeping ] His reactor 's starting to overheat . Slow it down , Plissken . You 're overloading the power plant . You slow down , dickhead . I 'm the one who 's dying . Plissken ! Computer : Power plant overload . Computer : Guidance systems malfunction . You no longer have control stick function . Obstruction dead ahead . Plissken . Yeah . I 'm here . Cahuenga Pass . What the hell happened to the submarine ? Disappeared off our screens . Plissken ! I got to go . Too bad about your boat , man , but we 'd appreciate it if you 'd stay off our beach . Just passing through . You look kind of familiar . [ Thunder ] [ Gunshots ] [ Distant Shouts ] Car Radio : j Just last 10 seconds down j j Free flowing , don 't lose control j j 10 seconds down j j Free flowing , don 't lose control j j 10 seconds down ... j What do you want ? Nothing , dude . I just realized who you are . That 's all . That 's all ? Come on , man . I 'm not looking for trouble . You know , I used to see you a lot when I surfed the birds . See you on the Police channel . You 're pretty far out , Snake . I mean , cool . But I kind of thought you 'd be ... taller . Which way to the Hollywood Bowl ? Down that way . [ Rumbling ] It 's just an aftershock . No big deal . We get them all the time . Thanks for not killing me , man . I owe you one . Acid rain . [ Thunder ] Hey , Snake , what are you doing here anyway ? I heard they busted your hump pretty good down in Cleveland . Man on soundtrack : j Sweating and bleeding j j And staring and thinking j j Sinking deeper , and the tunnel 's black j j I 'm swimming j j And the sun is burning hot j j Get on the hunter ... j Computer : Location of rescue team member : 50 yards southeast from your present position . j Seems like I 've been here before j j Seems so familiar j j Seems like I 'm slipping j j Into a dream within a dream ... j Computer : Location of rescue team member : 40 yards from your present position . Woman : j Say it , say it j j Oh , honey , bring it through tonight ... j [ Computer Beeping ] Computer : Rescue team member is located 10 feet from your present position . Hey , man . 100 bucks says you can 't put 3 blades into him . You want a throw ? Hey one-eye , I 'm talking to you , man . Where can I find Cuervo Jones ? What do I look like , a fucking tour guide ? Hey ! It 's wintertime , baby . I 'm looking for Cuervo Jones . Why ? You work for Hershe ? Hershe looking for Cuervo , too . Where is he ? You can see him on Sunset . He 's supposed to be coming by any time now . Sunset . Boulevard . Ooh-hoo , you really are new , aren 't you ? Come on , baby . I 'll show you . Keep going down that way , honey . You can 't miss it . Hey , one-eye ! Look in my face when I talk to you , shit-heel . Whoa ! [ Heavy Metal Music playing ] Computer : Neurosystem shutdown- - 7 hours . Plissken . Yeah ? Go ahead . Did you find the team member ? Snake : Yeah . They 're using him for target practice . He 's not going to be much help . What are you going to do ? Amigos , no matter where you come from , no matter what color your skin is , we 're all one raza- - The raza of the oppressed ... Watch the parade . What ? We 've got the north by the balls . Come on ! Right ? Right ? Meet me at the Happy Kingdom . Let 's party tonight because tomorrow we 're going to start our way back to glory ! [ Cheering ] Yeah ! Yeah ! Oh ! Hey ! Huah ! Yeah ! We got our freedom ! We got a future ! [ Shouting In Spanish ] [ Tire Squeals ] That looks like Snake Plissken . Who ? He used to be a gunfighter . Kind of faded out from the scene a few years ago . I hear he slowed down some . Doesn 't look that slow , Cuervo . Watch it ! Watch it ! No problem ! No ! Nobody rolls into town and disrespects me- - Not Snake Plissken , not nobody . Bolas . [ Driver Shouting In Spanish ] Take him out ! I 'm going to give you assholes a chance . Ha ha ha ! What do you say we play a little ... Bangkok rules ? Nobody draws until this hits the ground . You ready ? Draw . [ Tires Squeal ] [ Speaking Spanish ] Hey , he left his coat here , man . Malloy . I 'm here , Plissken . Have you got the black box ? Negative , and I just lost the core burner and holocam . I don 't need to know what your problems are , Plissken . I just want my black box . Now , you 've got 7 1 / 2 hours . Do you read me ? Listen to me , Malloy . This guy 's got more heat around him than the President . Now , I can get your precious little box back , but I 'm going to need more time . You understand ? You listen to me , Plissken . That little headache that just kicked in will only get worse . You 're starting to feel the effects of the virus . Soon you 'll have a fever followed by a lack of energy . Now , you bear that in mind . Just push on through , soldier . [ Rumbling ] Oh , don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Thought it was you . Yeah . I recognized you right away . Oh , I 've been hanging out around here for more years than I want to think about , but I never thought I 'd see Snake Plissken cruising Sunset Boulevard . It 's a real pleasure to meet you . I 'm Map to the Stars Eddie . Where 's Cuervo Jones ' place ? Oh , he 's the man with the juice , Snake . He 's got the President 's daughter . He 's setting up something big , but I got a feeling you know all about that , right ? Location . That way . If you 're going to go through Beverly Hills , you 're going to need a map . It 's prerecorded . I narrated it myself . Eddie 's Voice : Welcome to your very own map to the stars . That 's me . Sure . We all know the big one wiped out the entertainment industry here in L.A. , but the glamour and excitement of Hollywood is still alive , so come with me and see where the stars ... Hey , Snake , you 're going to need this . I 'm telling you . All right . I 'll give you a deal . 50,000 bucks . That 's a real bargain . ... And here we go . Sucker . [ Distant Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] [ Siren Approaching ] Shh . Stay down , man , or they 'll see you . This is only their second shift . You make one move , and we 're done . And don 't make noise . If you want to make noise , go and find another bush . You 're the one making all the noise . Ah , shit ! Plissken 's tracer just went down . Terminated ? Yes , sir . We can 't even locate him on heat seek . He 's wearing stealth . Now what ? We sit tight , and we wait for the man to communicate with us . President : Wait ? For how long ? He 's probably dead . Wait , Mr. President . Be patient . [ Distant Screaming ] I told you to stay down . Now look what you 've done . Oh , I can 't believe this . Are you Snake Plissken ? You look like him ... in a way . By the way , genius , we 're both dead meat . [ Distant Screaming ] What are they ? Surgical failures . They live here . Too many implants and face-lifts over the years- - Their muscles turn to Jell-O . The only way they survive is to have fresh body parts transplanted over and over again . Oh , my God . Snake : Who 's that ? The surgeon General of Beverly Hills . These are no good . You couldn 't give them away . And this ... I can do nothing with this one . Yeah . Wheel it away . - You heard what the man said . - Get rid of it . I can 't work with garbage like this . Now , these two ... They look very good . My God , they 're real . What a beautiful blue eye . Shame he only has one . Nurse . Still ... one eye 's better than none . Anybody moves , I blow his brains out and then yours . You ... get my guns . Snake : Now . Snake : Back off . Now , everybody relax , and he won 't die . Hey . Hey , man , help me . You 're never going to find your way out of here without me . Really . Cut her down . Down there . Quickly . Snake : Get in . I think we lost them . I think we 're lost . Tsk , tsk , tsk . This way . I used to run guns with the Black Jihad last year . We drove golf carts up and down these tunnels . I know them like the back of my hand . You are Snake Plissken , aren 't you ? I used to be . I thought you 'd be taller . So , what are you doing in L.A. ? I 'm dying . Ooh . But first you got to find something ? President 's daughter . She 's with Cuervo Jones . So you want to go to Cuervo 's place ? I 've been there once . Show me . All right . I used to hear about you all the time , like they could never catch you no matter what you did . Very cool , Snake . Sooner or later , they get everybody . Up . Cuervo Jones ' place is down that way . Get off at the Vermont exit . Go south . You can 't miss it . Be careful , though . This is Korean Dragon territory . It 's very dangerous around here . Bye . Snake ? When you find the President 's daughter , are you going to take her back ? No . So you are staying in L.A. ? Not if I can help it . Sun is coming up in a few hours . U.V. ' s going to be bad today . I know a place where we could crash if you want . My boyfriend and I broke up tonight , so ... I 'd love to take care of you ... and make you feel good . I 'll read your future . The future is right now . ... And condemn the innocent blood . Dear God , we call on You to be our defense , our rock , and our refuge . Let us pray . We give thanks for being alive and pray that in Your mercy ... [ Footstep ] Snake , It 's me- - Taslima . I 'm coming with you to Cuervo 's place . Yeah ? They 're new . They don 't belong to any gang . They 're just scared , that 's all . That 's how I was when they first deported me . Why are you here ? I was a Muslim in South Dakota . all of a sudden , they made it a crime . I mean , why do you stay ? You can go south- - Mexico . L.A. ' s still the place , Snake . If you think about what 's happened on the other side of the world , that 's the prison . This is the only free zone left ... anywhere . Dark paradise . At least we get something out of the deal . A girl can still wear a fur coat if she wants to , for example . No , no , no . Once you figure out this place , it 's really not so bad . Get down ! Uh ... [ Gunfire ] Uh ... Woman : Where 's it coming from ? The car in the street below ! [ Gunfire ] [ Shouting In Korean ] Hop in , Snake . Come on . [ Tires Squealing ] I didn 't think I 'd ever see you again . How did you get out of Beverly Hills ? Nobody ever gets out of there alive . Yeah . Maybe that 's why you let me walk in there . Oh , come on , man . I tried to tell you , you need one of my maps to get around . Shut up down there ! You got to start listening to me , Snake . I got connections around here . If you need anything , I 'm the man to see . You can 't just be walking around town without knowing the ropes . You take the wrong street , you 're dead , pal . Stop the car . [ Laughing ] All right , Snake . Anything you say . Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones ' place . Where is it ? It 's right over there . It 's pretty neat , huh ? This is Cuervo 's car . He lets me use it sometimes . Hey , not to worry , Snake . You 've just been shot with a fun gun . Feel it ? You feel it ? It 's pure mesh , man . 100-proof artery choker . It 's like Cuervo says , when the hit pulls you down to one inch from death , that is living , man . You should have talked to me first . I could have set this up . I 'm actually Cuervo 's agent , and I would love to represent you . We could make a bundle . I couId help your career . You 're a legend and all , but last couple of years , it 's like you 've fallen off the face of the earth . Eddie : Cuervo , I delivered him , didn 't I ? Eddie : Cuervo , I delivered him , didn 't I ? I figured out what the cops sent him in to do . Plissken was the second rescue team . He was supposed to get the black box and the girl and take them back out over the wall . all I 'm asking for is a finder 's fee after you take over . Maybe Wisconsin . I don 't know . OK . We 're almost set up , Cuervo . Good . Well , um , I originally heard about this when I was working for NASA . Check this out . Common , ordinary remote-control unit . Yeah ? Everyone 's got one , right ? Here 's the kicker . This instruction disk hooks you right into the sword of Damocles , the ultimate defensive weapon system . You see that ? There 's a ring of satellites encircling the Earth . Attached to each satellite is a mega neutron bomb . When detonated , each satellite unleashes an intense electromagnetic pulse , but E.M.P. doesn 't harm a living thing . What it does do is shut down every known power source , all electrical devices , cars , airplanes , toasters , computers , everything- - even batteries . But this ... makes this an aiming device that gives the user incredible accuracy . You can pinpoint precisely what you want to shut down- - A taxi cab in Buenos Aires , the entire country of Spain . Amazing . Brilliant . Hell , you could key in all the satellites and shut down the whole planet , send it right back to the Dark Ages . Let 's face it . He 's dead . I agree . Plissken 's been dead so many times I can 't count them all , but he never stays down . The mission 's scrubbed , Commander . I should never have let you talk me out of that air strike . well , it 's on now , effective immediately , full-scale . Target : Los Angeles . flatten it . Burn it . No ! What did you say to me ? Cuervo Jones is holding all the cards now , sir . He sees our aircraft come in , he pushes that button- - Kaboom ! There goes our aircraft , and there goes the United States of America . We don 't even know if he knows how to work the goddamn thing . Cuervo : Snake Plissken , American outlaw . You 're going to like this . Remember , Cuervo , you got to punch in the world code first . 666 . That brings all the satellites on line . Then you can aim the prototype . Eh , pendejo , you think I 'm stupid ? No . No . No . I 'm sorry , Cuervo . Bring them in . [ Man Speaking Spanish ] OK , OK , go on . Hello , North America . Buenas noches , sud America . Yes , I am Cuervo Jones ... Wait a minute . That 's Plissken . This is the reall L.A.- - people without hope , without a country ... I knew it . He 's alive . You know what they want : Liberation . Now it 's their turn . I 'm taking over with this . [ Beeping ] Now , I told you not to try to get this back , didn 't I ? But you disobeyed me . Well ... He 's entering the target code . Bend over , Mr. President . Time for a spanking . He 's targeting Lynchburg . That 'll shut down the capital . Patch me in to the White House . This broadcast is going out live all across the country . Yes , this is the President . Get me my wife , please . - Are you watching TV ? - Yes , Eve , I 'm watching it too . Curfew . - [ Dial Tone ] - Hello ? Hello ? Jones : Hey , Presidente , silence is golden , no ? Don 't tell me you didn 't enjoy this just a little bit . I mean , if your wife 's anything like your daughter , she 's sweet to eat , but you just can 't shut her up . Utopia : Hey , knock it off , Cuervo . All right , now this is set . We shut down the entire United States . I want a police chopper to come and get me at the Happy Kingdom no later than 5 A.M. Once I 'm airborne , you 'll get your orders . Remember- - Don 't piss me off , or I 'll ... pull the plug . I 'm at the mercy of this madman . Don 't count Plissken out , sir . He 's tanked . He 's a P.O.W. But he 's still alive . [ Shouting ] Crowd : 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ! [ Buzzer ] Shot clock ! Get him . Get him up . But this is insane . It is . That 's the point . Aah ! Yah ! [ Crowd Booing ] All right , all right . Hey ! [ Feedback ] I promised you tonight was going to be special . I also promised you one last great spectacle of death here in this historic arena . Now you will see that death . I give you ... The death of Snake Plissken ! [ Coughing ] [ Crowd Cheering ] Some people think you 're already dead , Snake . Some say you never will be . 'Cause you may have survived Cleveland , you may have escaped from New York , but this is L.A. , vato . And you 're about to find out that this fucking city can kill anybody ! Crowd chanting : L.A. ! L.A. ! Game time ! Basketball . 2 hoops. full court . 10-second shot clock . Miss a shot , you get shot . Shot clock buzzer goes off before you shoot , you get shot . 2 points for a basket . No 3-point bullshit . all you got to do is make 10 points . That 's it . By the way , nobody 's ever walked off that court alive . Nobody . [ Crowd Cheering ] All right ! [ Buzzer ] Crowd : 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ! [ Buzzer ] Crowd : 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ! [ Buzzer ] Nice shot . He 's getting tired now . Crowd : 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ! [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Crowd chanting : Snake ! Snake ! Snake ! This town loves a winner . [ Chanting Continues ] He won , Cuervo . [ Cocks Gun ] You can 't kill him . I have to . [ Chanting Continues ] Get off ! [ Rumbling ] It 's the big one ! Find him ! We 're going to Anaheim . Come here . Eddie : Cuervo . Cuervo , wait up . Give me a minute . Get lost , agent ! Come on . We got a relationship here , man . Let me make something cIlear to you . I 'm starting to get irritated , and that 's not a good thing . Irritated with me ? Cuervo , I 'm taking care of you . I 'm with you in all this . Don 't you understand ? We can 't find him , Cuervo . So keep looking ! Get in the car . If I 'm being too rough on you , you just let me know , OK ? Snake , don 't shoot . It 's me- - Utopia . I 'm alone . This whole place is a nightmare . Cuervo 's a killer . He 's worse than my father . I want to go back with you . [ Cocks Gun ] Oh , my God . My father sent you to kill me , didn 't he ? [ Sob ] Shit . Get out of here . Go . Wait . You can 't take that back , Snake . Oh , God . You can 't give that to him . All he wants to do is control everything , just like Cuervo . If I don 't take it back , I 'm dead . [ Rumbling ] Oh no , not another one ! Run ! [ Glass Breaks ] It 's over . Get me a complete damage report as soon as possible . Yes , sir . Oh , thank God Almighty . Maybe that 's the answer to all of our problems . Maybe ... maybe they 're all dead . Maybe . Oh , Cuervo , man ! We almost bought the farm . The whole place just fell in right behind us . Where is Plissken ? He 's down there . He 's dead . He 's history , and I did it . I killed him . I shot him . Right ? Tell him . Give it to me . Oh , yeah . I brought it back to you , Cuervo . It 's all there . Whoa , dude , is that you , Snake ? Far out , man . Hey , did you find Cuervo , man ? Hey , Cuervo , wait . I 've done it all , man . I killed Plissken . I got your girl back . I gave you all the marbles- - So where is he ? I shot him . He went down , OK ? His body 's probably washed down into Wilshire Canyon somewhere . Good ! So then you know where he is . Bring me his head . Where 's the Happy Kingdom ? Anaheim . It 's the staging area for the big invasion . The whole town 's going to be there , except me . I 'm staying right here , man . I 'm ready for the big wave . It 's going to be some eternal one . Take me there . What ? Take me there . Hey , you 're not doing so well , Snake . You need help . Here . Hold on . Aah ! Who shot you ? It doesn 't matter . Well , yeah , you 're right . You should talk to Hershe . She hates Cuervo , big-time . They used to be partners , and they split up . - Who ? - Hershe . She lives downtown in a big boat , down that way . She hangs with Saigon Shadow . Man , they don 't take shit from nobody . [ Rumbling ] What is that ? Tsunami , Snake . Tsunami ! Woo ! Surf 's up big-time now , mister . Ha ha ! Start feeling better quick , man , 'cause you ain 't got time to get out of here . This is going to be some kind of ride , man . Some kind of bitchin ' ride . Let 's go . Come on . Bitchin ' , man . OK ... Let the front edge pick you up . Don 't get on your board till you ride to the top . Don 't blow it , man . If you fall off the board , it 's the big one . Got it ? Woo ! Bitchin ' . Hang on , Snake . Aoow ! You got to be kidding me . Later . Ooh , Snake , yaha ! [ Horn Honking ] You 're going to tell me how to get downtown , somebody named Hershe . Yeah , sure , Snake . No problem . Hey , hey ! Are you going to kill me ? Hershe . Right . Keep going straight . 2 blocks down , make a right . Computer : Warning . Neurosystem shutdown . One hour . Eddie : I first met Hershe when I got deported . She helped set me up in business . We 're talking a power player , Snake . Cuervo 's got the numbers and the firepower , but Hershe 's got a burning spine made out of steel . Big-time fast-lane ambitions . Think about it- - the 2 of you hooked up together , I 'm talking box-office material here . What ? Easy , Snake . I see him , too . We 're OK . Come on . She 's going to love you , Snake . You 're going to love her , too . We 're going to make this thing happen . By the way , I 'm through with Cuervo . The guy 's got no sense of loyalty whatsoever . Right through here . What ? Hey , man , how you doin ' ? Long time , no see . Remember me ? Map to the Stars Eddie . Yeah , well , I got somebody I want Hershe to meet- - Snake Plissken , baby , right here in the flesh . [ Faint Blues Music playing ] Your gun . Great . Thanks , pal . All right , we 're in . Strange scene in here . Let me do the talking . Hey , Hershe , how you doin ' ? Hang on . Hang on , guys . This is big . It 's Snake Plissken . I brought him here to see you , Hershe . He 's got a little business proposition . What 's in it for me ? Wait a minute . I know that voice . Yeah ... you 're Carjack Malone . Not anymore . Eddie : You two know each other ? Well , the more things change , the more they stay the same , huh , Carjack ? glad to see you 're still packing a gun between your legs . Hold on , honey- - You owe me . You bolted on me back in Cleveland . Hershe , you were in Cleveland ? Oh , yeah . With me and Texas Mike O 'Shay , except you looked a little different in those days , Carjack . You get one thing straight , Plissken . I 'm no longer Carjack Malone . I 'm Hershe Las Palmas , the most drop-dead , to-die-for number you ever laid that one eye on . I don 't give a fuck what you are . I want to know what the hell happened to you in cleveland . I was called away on urgent business . I got caught , and you didn 't . Don 't lie to me ! All right , so I made another deal . I got my ass kicked , not you . I 've been here 5 years , not you . I got a new deal for you . You help me , you live . I wouldn 't do that , Snake . You see , we all have an agreement . Anything happens to me , and you 're dead . I 'm already dead . [ Coughing ] I see your point . What 's the deal ? Get me to Cuervo Jones . I got one hour . Dream on , blue eye . Say good night , Carjack . Hold on ! Cuervo Jones has more firepower than 2 armies . No one gets near him . And he 's got the black box and the girl . He 's running the show . What black box ? The one that shuts down the power permanently . Oh , yeah , right ! And the plutoxin 7 virus is going to kill you in less than 10 hours . Ohh ... What ? It 's bullshit , baby . Rumor control . Government propaganda . Just one more lie . Eddie : Snake 's telling the truth , Hershe . I used to represent the guy who invented it . Swear to God , Snake . Hey , hey . What 's the deal , gorgeous ? We get the girl and the black box , and we get out of here . All of us ? Yeah . Me , too ? Ha ! Why should we leave ? I love L.A. Where we goin ' to go ? What 's the big payoff ? The President 's promised to give whoever helps me a million dollars . Oh , yeah ? A million greenbacks ? I got 10 million of them in the next room . Uh-uh . Bluebacks . Oh , come on , Snake . Bluebacks . I swear to God , Eddie . This is bigger than Cleveland . It sounds thin to me . You want to stay here while Cuervo Jones rules the world ? Hell , no . That sucks . So how are we going to get out ? I 'll tell you that when we get there . Oh , Plissken , now , you are such a loser ! Man , making up shit along the way . That 's why I left your ass in Cleveland . You 're just a chump just like the rest of us . No deal ! Government chopper . It 'll be there . OK , that 's better . So how are we getting there in under an hour ? That 's your end . Edward . The best you could do from here is take the 5 . The shape it 's in- - 2 1 / 2 hours minimum . No , use the air . They 're burning : The Santa Anas . The night wind . What are you talking about ? Death from above . Eddie : I don 't know about these things . Hershe : You don 't like it , don 't come . Where 'd you get these rigs , Carjack ? My name is Hershe . Do you understand , Plissken ? Eddie : I got an idea . Got any red nail polish on you ? What ? Come on . Hershe : I expect that back , Eddie . Eddie : Yeah , yeah . There . It looks just like the sword of Damocles instruction C.D. Maybe we can pull a Texas switch on Cuervo . Yeah , if he lets you get close enough . Don 't worry . Let 's do it ! The wind 's up . Come on . Let 's go ! Woo-hoo ! Aah ! Computer : Neurosystem shutdown , 34 minutes . [ Shouting ] [ Gunfire ] Crowd : Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Cuervo ! Are you ready for the new world ? [ Cheering ] The attack is now under way ! [ Gunfire ] What 's going on ? Pilot : I don 't know . I think we 're fucked ! Get out here ! Get out of there ! You see Plissken anywhere ? Computer : Neurosystem shutdown- - 25 minutes . President : Get my jet ready . Get it fueled and ready to go . You can 't run away now . It 's too late . You have to stay and face it down . Mr. President . Commander , we are receiving reports from Miami . An armada of warships has just departed Cuba- - E.T.A. the florida coast in 45 minutes . They 're starting the invasion . I 've got to go to my quarters ! I 've got to pray ! Go with him . Make sure he doesn 't do anything crazy . Hey , Eddie , is that what I think it is ? Yeah . The place kept changing owners . Finally went bankrupt . Eddie : That thing in Paris killed them . We 're going to need some kind of diversion . Eddie : Hey , Cuervo ! Hey ! Hey , Cuervo ! I made it ! I made it ! Wait for me ! Whoa ! Oh , shit ! Oh ! Agh ! Ugh ! [ Shouting ] Hey , Cuervo ! will you please kill him for me ? Hey ! Hey ! I got news ! There 's about to be an attack ! You 're about to get hit , man . It 's Plissken . Plissken ? You told me that you shot him dead . Yeah , I thought I did , but I found him ... sort of ... alive . Sort of . Where ? Oh , Cuervo . What ? It 's so good to see you . Where is Plissken ? ! He 's near . You 're stalling , Eddie . Aah ! Jeez ! Talk , gringo , or I 'll rip your balls off . Oh , look out behind you ! [ Shouting ] [ Gunfire ] Ahh ... You have lied to me for the very last time . [ Screaming ] [ Gunfire ] Aah ! Argh ! Come on , hurry up ! Let 's go ! Get inside the chopper . It 's bulletproof . I 'll take my coat back now , asshole . Take me back , Snake . Secure the latch . Oh , you got the remote . Great . Yeah . Now give me the real one . What ? I didn 't make a switch . Yes , you did . I saw you . Give me that gun ! Aah ! Damn it . Carjack , we 're hooked up on your side . I hit him ! Ha ha ha ! Oh , whoa ! Ow ! Aah ! Hey ! Hey , get back here , Plissken ! Aircraft is entering quadrant 4 , sir . I 'm getting radio contact . Boost it . Snake : Malloy . Get the antidote ready , assholes . I 'm coming in . This is Malloy , Plissken . - Do you have the back box ? - I got what was in it- - remote control unit , instruction disk . Get the trucks rolling . We 're on fire . Computer : Neurosystem shutdown- - 2 minutes , 27 seconds . P.A. : all emergency vehicles proceed to the north perimeter . [ Alarm Ringing ] Ow ! Shit ! Shit ! P.A. : This is a full alert . Where the hell is he going ? Get ready to jump . Head for the tree line and disappear . Go . Go ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! [ Coughing ] Oh ! Oh , thank God Almighty ! Thank God Almighty ! President : Welcome back , Snake . Give me the goddamn shot . Computer : Your countdown clock has now terminated function . Your time is up . Ha ha ha ! I told you he was dumb . You took the fake , hotshot . Plutoxin 7 is a fast , hard-hitting case of the flu . Pretty good . Relax , war hero . We took you for a little ride , and you came through . President : Now , give me that unit . You want this thing ? Come and get it . Sir . What can he do ? Utopia : Let go of me ! Quit it ! You didn 't finish the mission , Snake . Looks like I 'll have to do it for you . Hold it , Mr. President . Shit . We 'll take this one . Get her out of here . Daddy . Take her to the chair . President : For he so loved his country ... he gave his only seditious child . Prepare to broadcast ... worldwide . President : Worldwide ! She didn 't know that she had that remote unit in her pocket , now , did she ? I was wondering what kind of lame switch you 'd try to pull this time , Plissken . You know , you 're becoming very predictable . Yeah , I guess so . You got a smoke ? The United States is a nonsmoking nation- - No smoking , no drinking , no drugs , no women- - Unless , of course , you 're married- - No guns , no foul language , no red meat . The land of the free . I don 't need the teleprompter . This is the President of the United States . I now demand an immediate retreat of all forces now threatening this great nation . If my demand is not met immediately , I will destroy your ability to function permanently . Mr. President , the Cuban theater of aggression remains mobile . E.T.A. Miami in 4 minutes . 4 minutes . Bring the aiming coordinates for Cuba and Mexico on line . Cuba 7-7-9 . 7-7 ... 9 . I now render this final solution . Eddie : Welcome to your very own map to the stars . Sure , we all know the big one wiped out the entertainment industry here in L.A. , but the glamour and excitement of Hollywood is still alive . Very funny . Yeah . I hope it was worth it , for now you are going to die . Everybody does . Kill him ... and bring me the real unit . Sir , we 're still broadcasting . Good ! Let them watch ! Do it ! Do it ! On my command ! Fire ! He 's not even here ! He 's a hologram ! Catches on quick , doesn 't she ? Got to be within a haIf-mile radius . Round up every available man . Hold it . Sir , the enemy is less than 2 minutes from our shore . What 's it to be , Plissken : Us or them ? Shut down the Third World , they lose , you win . Shut down America ... you lose , they win . The more things change , the more they stay the same . So what are you going to do ? Disappear . [ Beeping ] Woman : He 's entered the word code . No target code . Sir , that will shut down the entire planet . Snake : I told you you 'd better hope I didn 't make it back . You push that button ... everything we 've accomplished for the past 500 years will be finished : our technology , our way of life , our entire history . We 'll have to start all over again . For God sakes , don 't do it , Snake ! The name 's Plissken . He did it . He shut down the Earth . Ha ha !

 Dick , I am telling you , you need a vest ! I 'm wearing a vest . Yeah , but it 's wool . You need Kevlar . I 'm just going to the office . Yeah . The office where you work with your ex-fiancee . You remember her- - the bitter woman who wants you dead . Oh , that . Oh , look , Mary 's had an entire night to sleep on it . Besides , deep down she loves me . And I said I was sorry . What more could she ask for ? Ok . Dick , I am practically a woman , Ok ? I basically know how women feel , and she 's gonna want a whole lot more than " I 'm sorry . " So you have a choice . The vest or me . Oh , fine . You carry my lunchbox . Don 't bruise my banana . Clear ! You see , Sally , there 's nothing to be concerned about . You 've got to get- - oh , my god ! Mr. Potato man ! Who would do such a thing ? Hello , Dick . Oh , Sally . How could you do this ? I was mad at you , and I guess I took it out on a perfectly innocent ... plastic potato . Be glad it wasn 't your butt . Look , why can 't you just drop this ? Fine . I got engaged to you and didn 't tell you I had a wife . I said I was sorry . It made me feel terrible , but I 've stopped beating myself up about it . Well , that makes one of you . It 's Ok , Nina . Nothing to worry about . I 'm over it . I 'm an adult . I 'm moving on . In fact , Sally , I 'm glad you 're here . I have my yoga class tonight and Judith can 't make it . I have a groin pull . I 'd love for you to join me . Why ? Because I 'm an adult , and what Dick did does not affect our friendship . Don and I are going to the Rutherford renaissance fair tonight . Oh , no , you 're not . You 're canceling your plans and going with Mary . There 's no way I 'm gonna do- - fine ! Thank you . [ Blows raspberry ] There , you see ? I can be an adult , too . I 'm sure you can . That 's why I 'm going to continue to allow you to use my office . Your office ? It 's our office . Check the door , Dick ! It 's my office ! Always was , always will be ! [ Calm voice ] But I say that just to let you know . I don 't stress it . I just gloss over it . See ? Adult . Nina , I want my name painted on this door , and I want it twice the size of hers- - 3 times the size ! I 'm going to be the biggest adult in this whole stupid office ! Solomon ! You got a guitar , right ? No . Yes , you do . Tommy : no , not really . You any good ? Yes , you are . We 're forming a new band . A new band ? Well , what happened to state of contusion ? Creative differences . Now we 're whiskey kitten . And you 're our lead guitarist . I 've always wanted to date a guy in a band . And that 's exactly why I 'm joining this band . That 's the spirit , Solomon . Rehearsal tonight . Your place . [ Strums electric guitar ] Can I be your roadie ? Can I ? So you want to lug around heavy equipment for us while we treat you like dirt ? Yeah . Plus I get my pick of the less attractive women . [ Jangling ] [ Jangling ] Sally ! Shall we go , milady ? I 'm sorry , Don , I 'm running late for something ! I 'll call you later . Bye-Bye ! Don 't forget to tell Mary that I 'm roller-skating with supermodels ! What the hell was that ? She just made me look like a complete jackass . Ah ... women . I hear you , my friend . A woman may say that she wants a man to be obedient and nice , but does she really want that ? Yes , she does . No , she doesn 't , because then she 'll just walk all over you . Amen to that , my friend . Women are maddening . They pretend to be so adult , but just like that , they 'll sink all the way down to your level . Tell me , my friend , is that fair ? Yes , it is . No , it 's not . Let me ask you something , my friend . Do you want Sally to want you more than ever ? No , he doesn 't . Yes , I do . This just isn 't my day . Then you 've got to show her who 's boss . Lay down the law . You think ? I know . Be firm , my friend . Power ! It 's the only language women understand . You show Sally who wears the pants , my friend . That 's the way . Thank you , my friends . You 're right ! I wear the pants ! And inhale ... and exhale . Isn 't this great exercise ? Yeah . I haven 't had this hard a workout since the last time I went breathing . Well , that 's it , everybody . Thanks for coming . Doesn 't it make you feel taller ? Oh , god . I knew that dweeb was lookin ' over here . Here comes the old pickup . Excuse me . Yeah . I hope this isn 't being rude- - just get it over with . I was just wondering , is your friend attached ? Look , I 'm not- - her ? Mm-hmm . Could I interest you in some coffee ? Oh , no , thank you . I 'm sorry , but did you see me ? Yes , yes . And you did just fine for a beginner . Are you sure ? Oh , positive . Thanks . Well--look at me . [ Squeaky voice ] Me ! Dr. Albright ! Dr. Albright ! You got something from the white house ! Open it ! What ? ! Open it ! " Dear Dr. Mary Albright , " in recognition of your achievements " in the field of undergraduate education , " you are hereby invited to the president 's dinner honoring academic excellence . " Oh , my god . " Enclosed itinerary ... " blah , blah , blah ... " cherry tree inn on the Potomac . " Looking forward to meeting you , " sincerely , bill and Hillary rodham- - potato head . " Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Very funny . I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I just had to ! Ha ha ha ha ha ! This was stupid and childish . I know . But we 're even now , right ? Oh , yeah . Live that fantasy . Did you see the part about the cherry- - I got a work order to paint the door . Ohh ! Oh , yes . Right . Yeah , right here . Right over this name . And bigger ! And bolder ! So when one approaches the door , a mere glance will establish just who 's who ... in this office . Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo ! Oh , no , no , no , no , no . No . Oh , he 'd be very upset . Oh ho ho . This says " Dick Solomon . " He gets that a lot . It 's Dick ... s-a-l-m-o-N . Salmon . You know , like the big , pink , stinky fish . [ Band playing ] All right , let 's rock . Drummer : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ! Hey , hey , hey , hey . What are you doing ? Playing . Come on , man . We 're a speed metal band . No , we 're not . We 're a def metal band . It 's not about labels , Ok ? It 's about the music . About that music , um , how many songs do we have ? Just the one . We need more than one song . This isn 't about counting songs , Solomon . This is about the music . Well , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's about impressing August , and one song ain 't gonna cut it . Hey , man , if you 're true to the music , women , they can sense it . Well , if the women can count , we 're screwed . Let 's rock . ♪ One mo ' ! ♪ ♪ One mo ' ! ♪ Whooooo ! Ooooohhh ! ♪ One mo ' ! ♪ I 'm sorry . Matthew ? Hey , Matthew ? Matthew ! Yes . You--you look really nice today . Is there a problem ? 'Cause I 'm really busy . Yeah . I think I pulled my butt muscle ! Let me see if I can go run down a nurse for you . [ Door closes ] Damn ! Hi . Are you from the Swedish motor place ? [ Spanish accent ] Sí . I am Swedish . Yeah . It 's the red Volvo , um , over there . When I change gears , it makes a grinding noise . Is a grinding ? Yes ! Is a grinding . Ah ! Recognition at last . Now all who pass through the hallowed gates of huff hall will know that this office is occupied by Dr. Dick salmon . Cuando el car changes las gears , uh , no es bueno . Uh , it makes A ... rrrrrrrr ! Rrrrrrrr ! Yes . Rrrrrrr ! Rrrrrrr ! What ? Allow me , Mary . Con permiso , señor . La palanca Del carro De la señora salta cuando hace el cambio . Oh , Sí , Sí . Tambien , quiere Que Le instale Un equipo en stereo De doscientos matios con esos palantes gigantes en la parte De atras . Ah ! No hay problema . Oh , great . Y ... por favor , a Los costados , pinte llamas De color naranja encendido . Eso SERá muy Caro . Oh , no hay problema . Ella Esta llena De dinero . ¡ Bueno , bueno ! Thank you very much , Dick . No problema . The time has come to lay down the law . If you 're not ready to give this relationship 110 % ... then maybe we should start seeing other people . Don ! I can 't believe you 're saying this . Well , I am . If it turns out there 's somebody that we want , we should be free to just move on . Don , it 's like you can read my mind ! It is ? Yeah . You see , there 's this guy I met--Matthew- - and I gotta level with you . I want him bad ! You do ? Well ... good . No need wasting precious seconds pining over Don . Exactly ! Oh , Don , you really understand me . I mean , you know what I need and you tell me to go for it . It 's like ... you 're the best friend a gal like me could have . Sally , would you do me a favor ? Absolutely . Hold on to my gun . [ Band playing loudly ] [ Music drowns out conversation ] Get me some parsley ! No . Parsley ! No , not pepper ! Parsley ! This is pepper ! Pepper ! Parsley ! Turn it down ! [ Turns amplifier off ] This rock and roll music has got to stop ! Why ? Because it 's loud ! And rhythmic ! And rhythm can lead to dancing . Rock and roll music preaches a gospel of easy sexuality and relaxed morality , and I will not endorse an enterprise which is as fraught with peril as I believe this one to be ! So , you resent us for being young and living in a world full of carnal possibilities which you can 't possibly enjoy . Yes ! Now knock it off ! Ah , don 't listen to him , boys . I love rock and roll . I used to be a groupie for the Kingston trio . Ok . I 'm sorry , but you 're going to have to go . I had an all-access pass . As a matter of fact , so did they . All right , we get it . Dr. Solomon , come on , enough with the practical jokes . But , Nina , there 's nothing practical about this joke . It 's an utterly pointless , hurtful , and asinine waste of time . [ Giggles ] You sure you don 't want this furniture ? Absolutely not . As a student of the ancient Chinese art of feng shui , I can assure you that the spiritual harmony of this room was upset by having that bitch sitting there . [ Giggling ] Thanks for coming over on such short notice , Don . I knew you 'd call , Sally . It was just a matter of time . I need you , Don . I need you bad . Well , you 're lucky I was available . You know , I got a lot on my plate right now . You know , my--My lady plate . Listen , you can do something for me that nobody else can do . I know I can , baby . But if you expect me to come crawling back to you now , you got another think coming . Oh , no , I don 't want that at all . Are you sure ? ' Cause I can crawl like a bat out of hell . Oh , no . Thanks , sweetie , but what I need from you is a background check on Matthew . Who is he ? What are his weaknesses ? How can I cut him out of the herd and bring him down ? Why bother when you have a sick , hobbled wildebeest right in your own front yard ? [ Rhythmic banging ] Hey , Tommy . How 's the band ? Well , uh , we 've avoided the trap of over-rehearsing , which can be a problem , you know , when you 've only got one song . I wrote a song . Did you ? [ Singing badly ] ♪ Picture window paints my mind ♪ ♪ black horizon 's valentine ♪ rock and roll , baby ! Mary . Dick . Your desk was gone when I got here . I believe you . Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! It was me ! I had them take away your desk ! Me ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! This has got to stop . Oh , you just want to quit 'cause you can 't win . Oh , my poor defeated Mary . You 're just outmatched , that 's all . But it takes a big woman to admit that . And just to show there are no hard feelings , I 'm going to- - my arm is stuck . That 's strange . So is this one . It 's almost as if there was glue on my desk . Dick , don 't be ridiculous . It couldn 't be glue . It must be thermal bond epoxy . No ! Uhhhh ! Uhh ! Ohh ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Mistake . Huge mistake . Oh , thanks . Oh , wait a second . That 's better . Ohh ! You came ! How could I refuse ? Well , what was it that convinced you ? The flowers ? The radio dedications ? The skywriting ? You hired a skywriter . Well , he was more of a crop duster , but he wrote " Sally " over your house with diopropylene , so ... that explains the vomiting . Yeah . Look , I 've got to tell you , I have never had a woman work so hard to get my attention . It 's flattering . Meaning ... you want to go out with me ? Sure . Yes ! Ha ! I got you . You got me . Ha ! Ohh ! [ Laughs ] Well , now what ? Ok , I was thinking you could start off in jeans , but then you could change into vintage tuxedos between songs . Between songs ? We only have one song ! Well , you could change during the drum solo . The song problem is over , Tommy . I wrote 4 new songs last night . Excuse me , but since when are you in this band ? Tommy , tell them . Tell them what ? You 're not in the band . Well , if that 's how you feel , I quit the band . Well , maybe you should rephrase that to acknowledge the fact that you were never in this pathetic , non-performing band ! You know , that is it , Solomon . Your attitude is just tearing this band apart . You 're out of the band ! I never wanted to be in the band ! I 'm sorry , but you 're gonna have to go . What ? Harry ! We 'll send you a t-shirt . When I look at you , I wonder , what took me so long to- - uh-huh . I mean , you 're beautiful , you 're sexy . Uh-huh . Uhhh ! Uhhh ! Ow ! Yeow ! Ow ! Oh , Dick , I 'm so embarrassed . When we broke up , I was so mad at you , but now I 've just made it worse by acting like a child . Truce ? Truce . Great . Now we can go back to acting like adults . Yes , Mary . Adults . [ Whimpering ] [ Music booming ] Mary , it appears your Volvo is back from the shop . What ? ! Damn ! Hee hee hee ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! Women . Women . Women . [ High-pitched squeal ] ♪ Women ! ♪ You can 't live with ' em , and you can 't have heterosexual sex without ' em . That 's probably true . Well , I 'm outta here . When Sally shows up with Mr. Yoga , I 'm liable to go medieval on his ass . Bye , Don . What can you do ? You do things your way , they 're not happy . You do things their way , they 're still not happy . When are we gonna learn you can 't deal with women ? The female feigns weakness only to use it as a weapon . It 's like the praying mantis . Yeah . She acts so fragile and willowy , but when the male approaches , she sprays poisonous mucus from her eyelids , and he bursts into flames . Praying mantises don 't do that . So what ? The analogy stands . You can 't negotiate with them , Tommy . You gotta give as good as you get . Now , Mary found that out . Oh , yeah . The hard way . Why are there office supplies stuck to the side of your head ? That 's where I keep them . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ! Women ! Whoooo-hooo ! Hey ! What are you doing ? ! That 's my dad 's guitar ! He 's gonna kill me ! I guess I 'm gonna have to go .

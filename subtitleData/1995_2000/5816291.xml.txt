 This little seance isn 't going to freak you girls out . - Nah , I think it 's cool . - I like to be scared . Yeah , it 's kind of a turn-on . Good answer because Wyatt 's house is really haunted . - Yeah , right . - It 's te . You 've got your occasional chair stacking , floating beds - walls that sweat blood . - You , uh , learn to live with it . Wy , you want to bring out our surprise guest ? Ladies and gentlemen , I present to you , the Great Madam Bongovich ! [ clapping ] The spirits , they are restless . Many are eager to cross over . Who do you wish me to contact ? [ screaming ] [ eerie howling and screaming ] There 's a chance this was a bad idea . I sense an evil presence has joined us . I can smell the stink of its foul putrid flesh . Speak , o stinky one ! - Bite me . - [ screaming ] [ laughing ] Get lost , Chett . This is a serious seance . Sure , you gutless wienie . All you have to do is wrap a towel around your head and talk to a paperweight - and hell reaches out to grab you . - I 'd be careful with that . Cut it out . That 's dangerous . Too bad it ain 't a real crystal ball . It could show me a member of my family with some real huevos . Uh-oh . - What the hell ... ? - [ wailing ] - [ snorting ] - [ all screaming ] See you guys . - Thanks for coming . - [ door closes ] What 's going on ? Who 's the big freak upstairs ? Chett wanted to meet someone in his family . The crystal ball must have opened up a hole in time and sucked the big guy through . If I 'm reading this right , his name is Baldash and he 's from way down ... here . 12 century . One of the first Donnellys in the clan . We left Chett alone with him . He could be in serious danger . The varmint 's own skin made us a grand sail . We sewed it together hoisted it up and were carried all the way back to the home port by the breeze . That ... is the coolest . I don 't know how you got here or why . I hope you can stick around . - What 's going on ? - You must be Wyatt . I was just telling the tale of how we bested our enemies - off the Coast of Gaul . - Tell me another one , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great Uncle Baldash . You come from a mighty line of warriors , cousins . The Donnellys are a proud and noble family . We fight for what is right and we twist the limbs of - our enemies like twigs from a tree ! - All right . But ... I 've talked too much . Tell me , how does a Donnelly from the 20th Century amuse - himself between bloody battles ? - Come on , I 'll show you . Ha . - Thanks a lot , Madam Bongovich . - I didn 't invite him . Chett did . Besides , he 's your lunatic relative . I thank you for the costume . I believe it has aided in my scamming for babes . Yeah , it 's " No shirt , no service " in here . Aw ! There are so few pleasures of the flesh in your time . No , it 's okay . We have TV now . BALDASH : A device that brings women into your house ? - Now , that is magic . - Well , they 're not real . - They 're ... pictures . - Pictures ? But only cowards and those with weeping sores must do without the company of real women . Yeah . You said that . Yeah , this black soup makes me feel like I could lay siege to a hundred castles right now ! Mochachinos are a head trip , aren 't they ? A brave heart and a full bladder is a strange combination indeed . But come , let us see more of this world . We have many adventures before we sleep . [ Baldash yelling ] Here 's one for you . Aye . Ahh ... Aye . So , when do I call out the word " shotgun " ? Before I have drunken the ale or after ? Doesn 't matter . Either way you get pretty buzzed . Oy , you 're breaking her . Get out of here . Grab the pig . He 's a poor pisser . - Prepare to meet your maker , Knave . - Make my day , cheese-ball . I 'll make it your last , you dog-earred ruffian ! Skanky , buttheaded stink-wad ! Unmuzzled , bunchbacked maltworm ! - Scuzzbucket ! - Hedepig ! Sewer-sucking , fatheaded , momma-loving pus bag ! [ yelling ] You 're quite the wordsmith . 'Tis a family trait , you know . They say a Donnelly 's insult wounds like a dagger to the heart . Hey , you big jerks . - Mom always said he was adopted . - [ boisterous laughter ] You 're both hee-laous . Maybe it 's okay to smash mailboxes trample flower gardens and spray-paint house pets in the 12th Century , but it happens to be illegal now . Master Wyatt , I am teaching your brother the ways of your ancestors . Would you not like to learn to be a warrior as well ? Thanks . I 'll pass . Perhaps you 're better suited to be a monk my soft-skinned fellow . - A what ? - A monk . One who fears battle and has a knowledge of books - and letters and takes a vow of celibacy . - Bingo . It 's time to lay waste to the neighboring castles . Show me again your weapon of choice . We call it TP and it inflicts great humiliation on its victims . Most excelle . Should we not dip it in oil and set it aflame as well ? Well , I tried that once and the Pattersons really freaked out . [ boisterous laughter ] I 'm not a monk ! I go on plenty of dates and I 'd like to see you play me at risk . Then we 'll see who the Ruthless Tyrant is . Ha ! My brother is bonding with attila the hun . Sounds like someone 's jealous . Maybe . I 've known Chett all my life and I 've never gotten along with him half as well as Baldash . He 's a fun guy once you get past that wet-dog smell . - You might learn something from him . - Yeah . Why not go forth and frolic your brains out just for kicks ? All right . He can stay tonight but no more neighborhood rampages . We 're staying I. Maybe rent a movie . A nice , quiet evening at home . Dance contest ! [ " You Never Can Tell " by Chuck Berry playing ] Guys , look ! Hygelac ! What brings you here ? My Lord , you must return to Donnelly Castle . Grondin and his men are preparing to attack . - How close are they to the gates ? - [ hiccups ] Pretty close . I must go at once . Wait . I 'm going with you . That would make me proud . Oh , give me a break . As usual , you have no clue what you 're getting yourself into . Yeah , and as usual , you 're a wimp when it comes to doing your duty . What do I owe some 500-years-old guy with bad breath ? He 's your family . You may not think Uncle Baldash has good manners but he made this family . He cares about the Donnelly name and he 'll fight to defend it . Will you ? I didn 't think so . Come . Time is short . I 'm out of here , bro . Duty . Soon the cursed armies of Grondin will be upon us . So take up your swords fix the look of death in your eyes - and the taste of blood upon your tongue ! - [ cheering ] Tie up your boots . You don 't want to trip . My heart sings , Chett at the thought of you and I marching into battle side by side . - You give me great pride . - Thanks , Uncle B. I can 't wait to use some of those moves you taught me . Hey , guys . Look at me ! I 'm a princess . Trapped in the tower by an awful king and his handsome knight . - Who will save me ? - What is this , a monk costume ? - I 'm a monk ? ! - I think " Friar Wyatt " has a nice ring to it . I wouldn 't talk- - fool . There 's Chett . There 's an extra mattress in the wine cellar . What do you say , Wench ? Me and you ? I say , call me when you get out of charm school , pig . And I 'm not a wench . I 'm a princess . Wyatt . You 've come to fight ? - I came to bring Chett home . - What are you , my mommie ? - Forget it . I 'm staying . - You can 't . - If you stay , you 'll die . - Hey , I belong here , okay ? With real men . Manly men . Men who know the art of warfare . Men who aren 't afraid to die a slow and painful death - at the end of bloody sword ! - [ grumbling ] He 's just excited , lads . Don 't pay him any mind . You 're not a medieval knight , Chett . You 're a slacker who lives with his parents and reads highlights magazine . Now , come on . Let 's go . Forget it . - Baldash . - Grondin , my old friend . I will be a special pleasure tose your head on the end of my blade . [ laughing ] Just like a Donnelly to bray like an ass . I 'll show you what a Donnelly 's capable of you scurvy little tick ! - Do your worst . - Do the death ! Right ? Aye , very good . - Do the death ! - Do the death ! [ yelling ] This is insane . They 'll kill each other . Here 's an idea- - Let 's get the hell out . [ laughing ] - Sing me a song , fool . - Take a hike , fatso . - I said I 'd like a song . - A song it is . I got to stop this . Everyone ! Throw down your weapon ! - No one is going to fight ! - Out of the way , monk . - This is not your place , Wyatt . - No ! You guys are about to slaughter each other and for no reason . - It 's stupid . We have our reason . - That 's right . This Ballbag 's father brought forth his armies to wipe out the forbearers of the Donnelly clan . After your family conquered the field of Aubergone . Really ? Yes . I 've always wanted to but I was unable . - Allergies . - Aw ... but somebody did ! - You must pay the price ! - Kill ' em all ! No ! Stop ! Geeze . Try to evolve a little , will you ? Now ! We were on to something here . Let 's just keep talking . Grondin , you go first . - What do you remember exactly ? - Well , my grandfather told me about a man who used to make cheese in his village and I believe that was somewhere near the poppy fields of Norwich . If I 'm correct . Yes ! I remember now . I had sinus trouble at summer . So , basically ... you 're upset because some guy a million years ago who might be related to him took a whiz in some creek that ran through land you may or may not have owned ? Well ... yes . But legend has it that the creek turned an emerald green and stank most foul for days . I must admit my people were quite fond of asparagus . See , if you just sit down and open an honest dialogue no one has to die . - Then we marched here for nothing ? - Exactly . That 's no fun . MAN : Why don 't you fight each other to the death ? - Who dares speak out of turn ? ! - Bring him forward ! We 'll kill him . Why don 't you each pick a warrior to fight for you ? Your lives will be spared and you 'll still get a decent fight . There 's wisdom in his words . Great wisdom indeed . When this hour is up we 'll make our choice . Talk amongst yourselves . You bonehead . They were making peace ! Forgive me for being a Al Donnelly , okay ? I don 't " share my feelings " to solve every problem . - I fight for what I believe in . - What are you doing ? I 'm getting ready . Uncle Baldash to going to pick me . - He said that ? - He 'll pick me . - So , dost thou cometh here often ? - You 're kidding me , right ? Why wouldst I kiddeth thou ? One so lovely and fair , - much like a princess . - A princess ? - You really think so ? - I speaketh the truth . Say , wouldst thou care to see the holy grail ? Get out of here . You have the holy grail ? - The holy grail ? - Come . Allow me to escort thee to my chamber of wonders . # 88 bottles of beer on the wall # # 88 bottles of beer # # One of those bottles should happen to fall ... # - Uh ... 16 ? - Close enough . # 16 bottles of beer on the wall . # The time has come . Grondin , make your choice . My designated warrior shall be ... Hemet . Very well . My designated warrior shall be ... - I 'm going to get medieval on his ass . - Don 't do it . You 're going to be his lunch . Wyatt ! What ? ! I 'll be with you in just a sec . What are you thinking ? He 's a building with shoes ! I 'll fight him . I 'll do it . No . No , Chett , my word is law . Wyatt shall have the honor of defending the Donnelly name . Might as well change the Donnelly name to " Dog Meat . " Enough talk ! Fight ! [ screaming ] [ yelling ] I 'm out of here . - Why did you pick him over me ? - Have faith , Chett . I feel the warrior within him will soon awaken . [ yelling ] - Lisa , help ! Lisa ! - I could be wrong . Hey , what are you trying to pull ? This is no holy grail . So ... sueth me . The important thing is , here we are , all alone . Perhaps thou wouldst desire to lay with me upon yonder cot and sire a young ... That 's no way to treat a princess . - Get him , Wyatt ! Get him ! - Coward . He truly is a Donnelly . Okay . Now I 'm getting nervous . Hey , Hemet ! You hear about the guy with a duck on his head ? The doctor says , " Can I help you ? " The duck says , " Yeah , get this guy off my ass . " [ laughing ] [ choking ] Or the two peanuts walking down the street ? One of them was assaulted . Get it ? " A salted " ? [ choking ] Finish him off . [ gasping ] [ roaring ] Hang on , Wy- - I 'm coming ! Victory is ours ! [ cheering ] Don 't let the gate hit you on the way out . - We 'll be back . - And the Donnellys will be waiting ! Wyatt . You 've shown me cunnings of a different nature . You make me proud to be a Donnelly . Come ! Let us partake of wine and goats ! You done good , bro . I didn 't think you could do it . - You made me proud . - Thanks . You too . - So , care to help me gut a goat ? - Sure . - But I get the entrails . - You always get the entrails . # Here 's a story # # ' Bout a man named Brady # # Who was living with three boys of his own # # They were four men living all together # # And they were all alone # # Ba-da ba-da bum-bum . # [ laughing ] You 're very good .

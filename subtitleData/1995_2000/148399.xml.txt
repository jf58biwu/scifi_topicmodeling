 What am I doing here ? That is the question , Jimmy . Why is Lisa here , and not elsewhere ? Because Lisa needs Jimmy , and Jimmy - Lisa . Love goes beyond need , or dependence . Love is love and that is that . Don 't look for other things . Don 't we still love each other , Jimmy ? What is Lisa doing here ? A year came by since Lisa left ... and I was floating again in the sea of nothingness . I have been left out before , but this time there wasn 't a glimmer in my soul . Maybe it 's never happened to you : you wake up in the morning , and your only wish is to be swallowed up again by the dark , without dreaming , or better still-without living . I don 't know where any of you are now , but just think : your blood is thick and dense as pitch . All thoughts drop to the ground ... like fallen birds . And your breath is choked . " Okosama Star " can go and kill itself ! I admit it , I got lost ... and now I am floundering . As the program loads , the data scrolls quickly in front of me . Here I am , seated n this hotel room , waiting : the " Indian virus " has not been launched yet . Thought I know this could be the end of me , I am feeling calm . We are still on the runway . No-one 's flying yet ... Room 717 , " Chelsea " Hotel . Tomorrow is Christmas Eve . I just can 't believe that all this began ... only two days ago . Hey ! You " Hey " ? All right , who are you ? How did you get my number ? My name 's Solo . I found your number in my pocket , I called , but I don 't know who you are . In fact , I don 't even know who I am and what is all of this ? - What am I doing here ? - Come in a little . Oh , yeah . Aren 't you that Italian who was in Chang Lee 's restaurant last night ? - Possible . - I gave you the number , remember ? - Last night ! - No . But I recall what you are saying . - You are replaying ? - All right , listen , pal ! If you are shooting up , or something , it 's your business , but when you get over it , if you want to have some fun ; you have my number , call me up . - I cost only 50 thousand aukus . - Repeat . Go on ! Keep talking ! I 've got this strange sensation like I have already heard all this , like ... - Who is here ? - I cornered you , spaghetti ! I am ahead now . All I got to do is pull the trigger . If you pull the trigger now ... " Nirvana " . A new game by Jimmy Dinni ... set up in the very edges of the agglomerate , and fused into your mind . an " Okosama Star " game . I must go away , Jimmy . It 's best for both of us . Life goes running fast , and I can 't keep up . Jimmy , the only thing that mattered to me ... was your happiness , but now I ask myself , " Who am I ? " and , " Why ? " ? It 's 8 P.M. , Jimmy . Your house wished you good evening , and reminds you that within 3 days ... you must deliver the new game to " Okosama Star " . And also , the dinner is served . Not now , thanks . It was you who asked to dine at this hour . - The beer is chilled just right , Jimmy ... - No , thank you . - Shall I draw the water for your bath ? - No ... I don 't feel like taking a bath . Turn the TV on . Perhaps you want to bathe later ? Stubborn , aren 't ' you ! Look , I don 't know . I 'll tell you when ! Turn the TV on ! It is my job to be useful , Jimmy . Now you have less than three days to deliver " Nirvana " ! Just bug off ! Thank you , Jimmy . If you do decide to bathe , please , tell me in time ... I cannot work miracles . Someone is at the door . - Check it . - Your favorite taxi , sir . Red-Rover . Oh , he is OK . Good evening , sir . I am sorry I am late . It was real hell out there . I can imagine . Here we are . Liquid marihuana . Best quality . Very well . Three viels ... I would do anything to be able to live here in the center of town . So , whatever you need , sir , whatever you want ... R-R-610 . Red-Rover-610 , sir . That 's my alias . I am like the 610 . - All right . - Have a nice evening , sir . 610 ! Hook-up " Nirvana " . Would not you like a hot bath first ? No , I already told you ! Start " Nirvana " and shut up ! Hey . You " Hey " ? All right , who are you ? You dialed my number . My name is Solo . I found your number inside my ... Have we already met ? I presume you could ... Ah , hi ! You must be the Italian I saw at Chang Lee 's yesterday . I gave you the number . You don 't seem to remember anything . We went through this already ... And there is that guy who shows up all of a sudden out of the blue ... There ! You see ? - It 's him ! - I cornered you , spaghetti . - I 've got to admit it . It looks like this is it . - Wait . Look , I know exactly what you 've got on your mind . You want to shoot this little thing so you can see me die once again . - Right ! How could you possibly know that ? - Because all of this took place ... you 've already climbed these stairs , I was just telling Maria ... I mean , you shot me , you killed me ! I am already dead , I was murdered ! Good , then you know what to expect . I went up on you , spaghetti , the game is over ! Not yet ! Oh , shit ! Solo ! Solo , come in a bit ... Solo ! I can 't see you ! Solo ! Are you listening ? What 's going on there ? It 's terrible . Downright sinful . Open the window ... Reach your hand in your right pocket ... Read it , please ... The note you hold in your hand ... Read it ... Hey , the piece of paper ! Read it . No ! What the hell ? Who is here ? - Holy ... - Show yourself . Where are you ? Oh , God ! - The note ! - Who is there ? You are just gonna sit and be silent ? Talk ! Look , I 've found you . Am I a guinea-pig ? What am I ? Look , I know you are there ! We should talk this out ! - All right , pick up your gun . - No , no guns , I am sorry . I don 't want to play anymore . Show me that you exist . Tell me your name ? - Software failure . - You must be somebody ! Software failure . I am Jimmy . I knew it . I knew there was somebody there ! So this is what you are doing ? - No ? It 's true ! - What is going on ? I checked through the processing unit of your computer . - I am afraid there is a virus , Jimmy . - A virus ? - What virus ? Is there a virus going around . - Software failure . All right . Just tell me the inconvenience this virus has caused . It has infected the main character of your game , giving him a sort of awareness , inducing him to play without responding to your commands , as if he had a true identity . - Identity ? ! Have you ever been in a video game that tears you to pieces ? ! Jimmy ! Your name is Jimmy , right ? You got to do a lot of explaining . We 've got to talk now . He knew perfectly well that he could not escape from there ; that his life was nonexistent . He glared at me from his world . Reality cannot sustain the weight of such a stair . A mind alone isn 't enough to comprehend it . Let me out . There is no future in here ! I make these games . One each year . Very profitable activity , indeed . I am proud of it . There is little else I can offer . Did you make the right choice ? You think you live a real life ? Take a look around . Oh , sure , you probably have ... a lot of nice things , beautiful house . But what if everything you see didn 't exist ? If it was like where I am ? You were like me ? You know , the only thing I can 't do in here - I can 't stop playing . But you can . So , stop playing , Jimmy . If you do , it means you are free ... Delete me , Jimmy . Hey , you ! Move it ! Taxi ! - You 've been sitting here all this while . - Yeah . You go out to Marrakech ? The outskirts , the arabs ? I could go out , but not to Marrakech . I am sorry . Double the fare . Person like you doesn 't belong in Kespo , sir . The Hotel " El Rashid " in Marrakech . Are you taking me , or not ? I am poor and hungry . Can you give me something . You 've used up your parking time , Red-Rover . Get along ! - I 'll pay you triple . - But not inside the Kespo . It 's as if you 've closed me in one of your worlds . I know you meant to give me cheer , but you have no cheer , you are a person who is spent and bored . I am wasting away , Jimmy . I cannot wait any longer . I am going to Marrakech to Joystick . I think he is still in the same place - Hotel El-Rashid . I know it 's dangerous in there , but I will try . I want to keep my eyes open . I beg you , don 't look for me Jimmy . I am not running away . I can no longer bear ... this captivity . I 've brought you in . I hope you will live to tell me who brought you out , sir ! Sir ! The scanner reads unregistered software ... It is on you ? I am an authorized programmer for " Okosama Star " . Let 's see you chip ... Welcome to the sounds and lights of Marrakech , sir . - With our best wishes , sir . - Thanks . Sir . Do you want a room ? You are saying that you want a room , in this place ? If this is a hotel and you have a room , I 'd like to rent it . Whatever you wish , sir . - However I must inform you ... that we take no responsibility for damages to your belongings , to your person and to your mind , sir . while you are present here in the hotel . Payment in advance . " Okosama Star " . - Do you know a guy called Joystick ? - I am afraid not . You could have forgotten . Doesn 't he live here ? Yeah . And how about his girl ? You know her ? Never saw her , or anybody called Joystick either . So you want a room , sir ? As you like it . You pay utilities with you chip card . Light and heat are not included in the price . Solo ! Turn around . Got it . Right . - Jimmy ? - I am in Marrakech . And I don 't really know what I am doing here . That 's better than being like an idiot and getting tested by your house . - Have you apologized ? - What are you doing out there in the street ? - Why do you ask ? - You 've just entered phase two of the game . Look out for a mafia type with a strange jacket . Now , the mafia is in this ? Jimmy , that 's too much , cancel me please . - It 's not that easy to do . In the data bank of " Okosava Star " ... there is a copy of " Nirvana " . And they don 't care who they step on . In three days it will be in the market with copies all over the place , whether I like it or not . Sir , excuse me ... - What 's the matter ? What are you doing ? - Solo ! What have you done ? ! - I shot the gangster . - No , you shot a tourist ! You said " a strange jacket " . Look at the jacket he 's got . What is the matter with you ? You made me kill a tourist ! - Get back ! Get back ! - I will see if I can find Joystick , if it 's possible to delete you . He is the one who can do it . I beg you , Jimmy . Cancel me . I got to run now ! Was it fondness , or compassion ? What exactly did I sense ? What did I feel for that creature I myself conceived ? I tried to make him amusing . But he not even once made me laugh . No ! - What was that ? - The program virus is spreading . Just relax , Jimmy . - Yeah , OK . - Nothing to worry . The truth about Joystick is ... that I didn 't go to him . It was he who came looking for me . Who are you ? What do you want from me ? I don 't want anything . I didn 't put the knife to your throat , did I , sir ? Then why did you ask for me at the desk ? - Joystick ! - Exactly , so ? Tell you boss , that I won 't spend my money for a piece of shit . " Phsychodelia " he called it . The son of a bitch . It would not even load in the computer . It 's worthless . It I spread word about here , he will be thrown out of here , you got it ? I got you clear . Now , calm down . And before you make a pin cushion out of my head , tell me about Lisa . She booked in here ? - Lisa ? - Yes . What 's with Lisa ? Who are you ? Jimmy . Didn 't she mention me ? - Jimmy . - yeah . Sometime I think I would like to dissolve in water , and be like this liquid warmth . You arrive , you see the tab full of water , take out the plug , and as the water makes glu-glu , I go down the drain . They told her that I was in the suburbs , in Marrakech , but she didn 't stay too long : month and a half - two months , maybe . She was really mixed up , I can tell you that . She looked for a job , kept talking about you ... - cried a lot ... - Have you finished , sir ? - No . - You can 't sit here , if you don 't eat . So , she hang around for a while . Got a job recycling software . But after a while , you know , money was scarce , electro-smog all over the place . So , she went to Bombay city . - You finished now ? - No . Why Bombay city ? All the way out there ... Through some Hong-Kong network she heard about some Indian Guru . She messed up with my computer for a while and then she took off . She even sent me a message from out there that she was OK . That is the last time I heard of her ... That 's a big agglomerate we live in , Jimmy . Oh , these damn things keep clouding up . Have you got a handkerchief , Jimmy ? I can 't see a shit . Thanks . You 've got to be careful , humidity can cause short circuits . - How long have you had them ? - 5 years , Jimmy , five years now . This place is full of people , selling kidneys , lungs , you know , spare parts . I would have sold my scalp too , if the price wasn 't too low . Cornea is still worth good money , though . I have video implants , black and white , you know , old and broken . " Zoni " is a lot better . " Zoni " color implants are the best , but they cost a bundle of money . Do you think we can have another beer , Jimmy ? Meanwhile you can tell me why you came looking for me . Another two . Hi ! How are you doing ? This is your Jolly Jack , cruising on the drug sea . I have all the shit available here in Marrakech for another couple of days . Synthetic Columbian grass . It 's legal , there is lots of it , but don 't do a shit . " Brain-rinse " , this is legal too ... Kidneys , lungs , hearts ! Everything cheap ! Hey , hey , we have got new games ! " Vega " , " Jeansendo " , " Okosama Starr " . - Blue cocaine , yeah ... Yeah , great thing ! Exciting , exciting ... but you got to go easy . It is fast . You doze off on your feet and fall on your ass ! It 's a superanalgetic . If you take it on a motor scooter , you are dead ! Well , there is one little thing that bugs me ... I mean , what is in it for you ? What is the deal ? And still , if you don 't mind , Jimmy , what is in it for me ? - There are hidden funds in the Okosama data bank . - Dirty money ? - Very dirty . - Good , keep talking , - don 't turn around . - What is it ? Keep walking , Jimmy . There is a Japanese , who was standing in line in the restaurant , remember ? When we got up , he left too . - No-one knows I am here . - Did you use your credit card ? - Of course . - This whole place knows you . It is not a secret . OK , keep telling me about " Okosama Star " , just don 't turn around . It 's in a subdirectory of " Okosama Star " , where they keep their dirty money . With access to that databank , all we do is order transfer money from bank to bank . - Do you follow ? - Yes , just like that Jap . Let 's get out of there , Jimmy . - Move ! - And since we are dealing with hidden funds , - they can 't make an official complaint . - Interesting . Do you have access to that databank ? First level access , then I need you . - You are not bullshitting me ? The money is there , isn 't there ? - Yeah , it 's there . All right , come on , Jimmy ! Yeah , blue koke is illegal , because it nestles inside your nervous system . It 's a fact , you loose your skin ; it gets scaly and repellent . You look like a lapper , but it 's worth it . - Jimmy-san ... - You are dead already ... You are looking at a colleague ... " Okosama Star Games " . Company psychologist . We feel there is something the matter . Is Jimmy-san nursing a problem ? Very well , then I 'll treat it . Tell me about your new game , it would relieve you . - Bad reaction , sir . Give me my badge . - No . Who knows , perhaps that is the effect of that fix ... I 've seen dozens of tourists ... that get paranoid . Even today there was a murder ... an Italian , Sicilian . Nearby . You are kidding . See ? Right on schedule . Chao , Maria . Compliments of Don Nikola . I see we have a visitor . So , you finally showed up . What an honor ! You and Don Nikola have a meeting . So , one more slip and you will be sliding . Take care , Maria . And call up poor Nikola . He loves you so much . - Don 't forget you have a meeting . - Who the hell is Don Nikola ? I don 't know him . Really ? Everybody knows Don Nikola . He is the one who runs " Koza-Nostra " here in Chinatown . He 's got a thing with pizzas . He orders two of these for me every single day . At times I wish he 'd change games . - What did you say ? - I 'd like to change my life . Yes , but you expressed it differently . " Games " - the word you used . Well , that 's the way of saying . I could have said , " Change the movie " . Of course you could have said that , but instead you used " change the game " . - Why did you use that word ? - I don 't know . Listen to me , Maria . I don 't exist ... and you don 't either . Nothing that surrounds you here exists : Don Nikola , the pizzas , the wine , this house . It 's all illusory . We are just puppets in the hands of unscrupulous jokers . We are just part of a game . You want to make up ? Come on ! Hi , Sid . Our friend licked up some psychedelics shit . You see , he is very agitating , He says he works for " Okosama Star " . - You will be dismissed ! - Calm him down . You see how nervous he is . - Poor bustard ... - I will pay for him , but I want something special . For this kind of money I could connect him to a psychopathic Thailander . - She does a 24-hour gig . - Sounds OK , Jimmy ? - A perfect directory for him . - You can 't do this to me , Jimmy san . This is illegal and appalling , outrageous ! - He is all yours , Penjabi ! - No , Jimmy-san . - I am your friend ! " Okosami Star " is your family . - No ! - Don 't betray your family , Jimmy-san . - Let 's get out of here . Did you like making love with me ? Well , yeah , of course , Maria , but ... we are just two electromagnetic equations bumping each other . It 's fairly distressing . Procedures in your head , but not your sensations , it was Jimmy who fed them in . Ok . - So , who is this person Jimmy ? - He is the guy who created us . Hey , friend , you need a paranoia . I sell paranoia : second hand , almost new , phobias , neurosis . Come on , you are always fooling around . Hye , china girl , you have a pretty pale complexion , I had this paranoia annoying me all night ... - Look , it 's got long fingers ... - No , you may stop , - we don 't need your paranoia . - Get out of here ! Beat it ! Oh , I just love Japanese food . - Why don 't we buy some suchi ? - Suchi ? It 's disgusting ! One suchi for her and one for me . - I get nocuous just at the idea of eating raw ... - Hands up , Italian , and no moving . Suchi ? It 's great . Healthy . We are from the Yakuza . Your mafia killed the Sicilian . - You did it ? - Then you do know Don Nikola ? Stop that nonsense ... Don Nikola ... Maria , I am doing it for you ... So , you don 't forget ... Bang ! You always come last minute . - Yeah ? And so ? - I will need to replace it ! You need a couple of " Zonies " . Two Babycombo color implant series . But they are a bit costly . Exactly what I told you , right , Jimmy ? With access to " Okasama Star " you can buy all the eyes you want . What access ? Their databanks are protected from all risks , including mutants , Jimmy . Yeah ! It 's not like playing computer domino . Are you picking cherries , or something ? Listen , Jimmy , you have to recruit someone extraordinary . Someone who has been surfing webs now for years and years . You know , with a superior level of consciousness . An Angel , a cherubim , who descends into the databank ... of " Okosama Star " , settling down gently on tiptoe , without arousing any devils . You got anybody in mind ? - Take it easy ! - You are a hopeless case . - That 's why I came to you . - Your circuit is melting ! - What 's this about devils ? - An abbreviation ... Destroying Visual Illusions . What it boils down to is a defense system . All the big bosses are scared of intruders and " Okasama " is no exception . But a real angel knows how to get around them . - Like you , huh . - No , for me it 's all over . Jay Gandy Simpson , Jimmy , Devil boiled him down , Jimmy . Just as he figured out how to break down UPM databank . So he shot into his pants ! - Your recycled eyes , - Shut up ! - like new . - You bustard . Give me my eyes ! - I am gonna fit your eye in there . - And you can do the same . Poor Gandi Simpson fizzled out like char . The database burned him in a microsecond . And now his cerebral powers are preserved in UPM chip bank . They sucked his brain and turned it to an intelligence scanner . He is like a cyborg . These multinationals always use him . Stop it , come on ... So , what do we do ? We give up ? There is always somebody out there . Don 't worry , Jimmy . - Oh , by the way , Ratzenberg ... - What do you want ? I could use some good credit chips , - so my friend doesn 't have to show his . - He is a lucky . One of our guys had himself hired in a restaurant chain as head cashier . They won 't last long . But these are uncoded , recycled credit chips . And they cost ... 200 thousand aucus each , no costly purchases though . All right , give us five of them . - Ratzenberg , tell me what 's with Naima ? - She didn 't show up for a check . - She could be at the " Los-Angeles " . - That 's where she hangs out . Jimmy , go back to the hotel . Take care of the bill . I 'll see you in an hour . Keep an eye on him , Doc . - What was the cost of these chips ? - 200 thousand aucus . Yeah . He is scared shitless . Once upon a time there were angels . Then they sold out to the multinationals . They come here to be naughty , transgressive , or probably because they want to remember the old days . Naima must be here . We got to find her anyway . Let 's go . Come on . - Hello , how are you doing ? I can 't see . Is that him ... - or his vision ? - Forget about him , Jimmy . Let 's find Naim and get out of here . You 've got to be careful with electrodes , it scars . Joystick ! Asli ! I had a little gigi to do , and that 's why ... Asli is very happy ... - that you are back , Joystick . - Yeah . Jimmy , it 's useless to go into lengthy explanations . I am just wondering if you happen to have 600 thousand aucus to lend me ? Come on , Jimmy , say yes . Yeah ? Thank you ... - All right . What do you say ? - Allah 's blessing . Inshallah ! Don 't worry , you are gonna get it back from my share . Thank you , sir . How is it going , Thumb . No jingle-no juice , sorry . He not only poisons you , he 's got to bust your hump besides . - You 've seen Naima ? - Go ask the boss . He knows . Come in , friend . We have George trying to get into London bank . The odds are 10 to one . Do you want to place a bet ? Look , the hook-up is neuroelectronic . It 's the favorite sport here in the suburbs . They jail in the center of town for this . Joystick , I give you ten to one . - You want the bet ? - I am afraid not , Migel . These days I am not lucky . I was hoping you would tell me something about Naima . She is on the Super express . - Don 't you want the bet ? - No , thanks , Migel . - See you around . - Hi , Joy . Mosquito ? Just bug off . Let 's get out of here . I want to challenge you , Joy . When George gets through there , we will fly the web together . They say you were the best . So , why don 't we go surfing ? - No surfing ! - The poor angel is scared . You were not scared seeing George 's brains boil ? Just hang on a second , Jimmy , we 'll split . They fried him . Hands off ! I don 't want to be touched . I don 't go surfing with programmers who deal with multinationals . Let 's get out of here , Jimmy . Hey ! It 's Solo . I 've been revived . This is all a fake . Come in a bit . Oh , yeah , I remember . Italian at Chang Lee 's restaurant . - Yes , that 's true , except that we went to eat a pizza . - No . - I don 't remember the pizza . - I let that Japanese kill me , because it was all a fake . Listen , pal , I don 't know what you are on I am not accusing you of anything , but if you want to have some fun with somebody from your home town , - call me up , I cost ... - Well , well , 50 thousand aucus . - Excuse me , sir . You see this guy here ? Mister Elegance . I 've already murdered him once . - Me ? - Bye . Hello . Listen , the other day you got killed by mistake , but if now I let you get away . You think we can screw up their mumbo-jumbo ? - I bet , we could . - Then run , run ! You are cornered , spaghetti . - I am sorry , I ... - Oh , shit ! It was fancy jacket who got in the way , I didn 't want to kill him ... I was only trying to modify the rules of the game . But you are too rigid , like that girl with the orange hair . Whatever they tell you , your answer is " yes " ! - Don 't you ever have any doubts about anything ? - Relax , friend . Can we discuss this calmly , without the gun ? After him ! - Oh , come on , guys ... - Quiet . We are from the Yakuza . - You killed the Sicilian . - Go to hell with all you Yakuza . It is not good for you , if you go away . It is not like I am afraid of dying , or something . I don 't give a shit about it . But those bustards found a way to melt your brain , and you sit there like a schmuck ... helpless . When I show off , what remains after ... goes to a databank of a multinational , and they use my DNA to create new software ... How can they ? I 'd give away anything to show these bustards ... there is still an angel around capable of surfing right to the guts of those databanks . yeah . If we are lucky , I could surf with Naima . If we are lucky , Jimmy . If we are lucky ... - OK . - Yeah . - That , for instance , would be great for us . - All these people around ... So what . It 's not a problem . The problem is breaking through the security : very sophisticated , aggressive . The why ... - Do you think it 's worth the risk ? - You are kidding ? It 's Super express , they say that Naima is there . And you want to go with a backpack , maybe ? Pay and let 's get out of here , it 's late . Hey ... I am light transport unit Mary-Ann . - Back off , you bustards , or I 'll blast you ... - It 's got a screen ... with a discharge of two thousand volts . - Didn 't I tell you to back off , shithead . - Yeah . I wouldn 't dare touch me if I were you . You stupid , ugly son of a bitch . - Yeah . - What the are you doing ? There are 3000 volts running under my paintjob . Would you like to feel what 's like ? Why did you stop talking ? - Just touch me , blockhead ... - Mary-Ann , don 't worry . Stick your hand out . Go on . OK , Jimmy . Mary-Ann welcomes you aboard . Welcomes me , or you aboard ? - What is this ? You have no faith in ... - But why should I be the first to get on ? Do you think I would tell you to get inside , if I wasn 't absolutely sure ? You can 't mean that , Jimmy ? It 's madness ! I always thought there was a good feeling , friendship between us . But no , nothing , zero . Not even you have faith in me . OK , that 's fair . I 've been warned ... what a distorted world we live in . You see ? It 's like I said . Open the door . What you are doing is illegal . The respect of private property is the very basis of civil cohabitation . Besides I am protected by transnational laws . Professionals ! Let 's see what they say now , assholes ? - Good for you , idiot ... - What 's now ? you have exactly 15 seconds to get out and split , before my security charge blows your ass to little pieces . 15 seconds . - Don 't listen , they are just bluffing . - 15 , 14 ... - If it 's bluff , it 's very convincing . ... 12 ... - Hey . - He has got a weapon . - Get lost ! - He is coming at us . Do something . I see him . Get going . Go ! Go ! Go ! Stop ! 5 seconds and good night ! Three , two and nothing ... - You are right , it was a bluff . - A bluff ... Oh , I am sorry , I shit myself . So did I. Strange , Naima isn 't on line yet . She has got to be around , she always goes around the net . See , we 'll find her . Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! Jimmy ! - If my eyes go out , you will drive . - OK . Solo . Jimmy . - Yeah . So , where are you and who with ? - In my car with Maria . She is sleeping in the back ; I was going nuts with all the repetitions , so I took the car ... - you know , for a change . - Yeah , but ... you are already in the third phase , Solo . So , beware now of organ-hunters . Organ hunters ? - What the hell else are you gonna invent now , Jimmy ? - I have to come up with new things . - There is no other answer . - Oh , sure , but you are still free to do what you want . - You are out there privileged with advantages ? - Advantages ? Look I had a cushy job before you faulted . Now , I go wondering around with a blind angel in a stolen truck , and that 's all thanks to you ! - You say you did it for me ? - For who else ? Ok , let 's forget it , I will get back in , - Will you shut up ? Go back , where ? Now other people are involved , and that 's all because ... you wanted to be deleted . Don 't be mad , I know I was a bit emphatic , but ... if I can argue with the only real person , the only real friend I will ever have , then I am really a blank . Peace ? Hey , what 's up ? I heard you talk ... I was only thinking outloud ... - sometimes it helps . - Outloud ? Hello . - A fax from the owner of our van . - What does it say ? More or less it 's a German fax . It says ... I am gonna strip your balls off , and use them as charms . Respectfully yours , Gullah . Bye , bye . How did you get this ? - She doesn 't like to be photographed . - In fact , that 's the only photo I have . You 'd better change the glass , it 's cracked . Were you staying together here in Marrakech ? - No . - No , I only said that , because she mentioned you ; you were a great help to her . Come on , what are you getting at ? You know , between us there was not any sex , or particular sort of involvement . I am more for , you know , a quick bang ... thank you very much , have a nice day . I can 't ... I can 't hack it . Everything stopped . - Hold on . - The web 's empty . - I can 't figure it out . - We have a problem . We 'd better do a little dissembling . There ! Now we 've turned it into a tall call ! - I will make it , I will make it , but that 's it for now . - Joy , it 's so cold . It 's normal , don 't worry about it ... Your metabolism is dropping . Get used to it , relax , He needs a blanket . Is that better Jimmy ? Yeah , much better , thanks . Solitude , that 's what I feel in here . And cold . I am only a phone call on hold , waiting to be connected . Or , at least , that 's what they should think . Solitude and fog . Is that how we could sum up death ? Fill your tanks , folks , with our Kuwait-Texas gasoline . Insert your chip-credit card ! We accept ... Holy-express , Mama-card , Tokyo-fuel , Fujimax and Give-me-five . We advise you not to touch any of our parts ... - before inserting your chip-credit card . - Vandalism bullshit ... - We should have one of those chips ? - Certainly . - Stick it in . - Wait a minute . Come on , fill it up . You know , I really hate hanging around here , Jimmy . Why ? It 's quiet , clean , even has a view . - I was wondering why no-one 's here ? - Because nobody likes to live ... next to an elevated highway . Besides , no matter how peaceful , you know you are not always dealing with the living in this world . You thought you could pull a fast one on us ? With your credit chip you would not buy a glass of water , and now your tank is full ... with a mixture of acid , sulphate and cyanide . - And now , get out of here ! - What 's going on ? This has always worked ... What 's the matter ? What kind of chip did you use ? Joy , what the hell did you put in there ? I put one of those duplicates . I 've never had any troubles with them . You didn 't use the cards we got from the doctor ? Where are they ? - Answer me ! - Shut up ! What the hell are you ? I had to sell the cards , all right ? Jimmy , I am broke and I am going blind fast . Who guarantees that the money you are talking about is really there ? That databank has first to be entered . They offered me cash , and I took it . You don 't know what it 's like loosing you sight here in the suburbs , Jimmy . What a jerk ! And now what do we do ? With the tank full of acid we can blow up ! - What do we do ? - I don 't know . Do you know ? Well then . You 've been apprehended thanks to a signal reaching us from the service station you are presently in . In approximately six minutes , you will be put into a helipull unit . We advise you not to resist and lie down with your face down and your asses up high . Thanks . Sounds fantastic . And now , what do we do ? It 's amazing , you keep asking as if I have the answer . What the hell is this , a quiz ? God has the answer . You had a problem , I solved it . - That 's Naima . - Hey , are you getting in , or not ? - Come on , we can 't keep her waiting . I already tracked you down , but I had this to finish . You were sure lucky was coming through there ... - Here ! - Have we got it ? - Right . - And now a Christmas message ... from the president of " World Food " . wrapped in plastic , for seeing is believing . You are what you eat . Dear Friends , only a few days till Christmas ... best wishes to one and all . Ever since " World Food " entered the political scene ... - it was clear to everyone that industry and government ... could work together . Yeah , I love it . It is certainly not a secret that the gross national product has reached unprecedented heights , literary soaring to the ... - Yeah , Naima ! - By imposing our choices ... - You see that . - Due to technical problems ... - president of World Food ... - has to interrupt ... - Best greetings , president ! That 's brilliant ! How did you get around their frequency panel ? With Algerian and Australian satellites ... it 's not an easy trick , you have to keep moving , otherwise ... I am back on line . An Asian surfer wants me . This is the guy from Burma . - I 'll put some coffee on , Ok ? - Do you really drink it ? I love it properly made . I have to stay awake . Are you gonna tell me what you want ? I haven 't slept for three days . All right , if we are inside a game , or a toy ... - what 's on the outside ? - The winners and the losers . - Reality . - And could they be ... imprisoned just like us in a story ? Yes , you got a point . Bravo ! What the hell is going on ? We are surrounded . Get out ! - Who are you ? - The organ-hunters . - Part of the game ... - We are going to get you alive , or dead , as dictated in the book . You 'll end up in the freezer . We 'll end up like ice-cream . Ok , listen , guys ... Jimmy has already told me about you , hunters ... It 's your prescribed job to find us ... cut us into pieces and sell our organs to the multinationals . And you have to obey , but for just a second follow my reason . You are not able to make choices , they are made for you . And if we do this , or that , it is not our doing . We are a pastime , or a game . If we keep killing each other , we are playing into their hand , They want to send us back to the start . I think I convinced them . It 's not that I hate the sight of money , I just don 't see why you are talking about this ? Because , surfing is a game of no return , its ' forever . What is this , is this gonna blow us out . Better not , with all the money I put in this rig . A lot of hardware here . pretty old-fashioned , constant repairing . I am the best hi-tech in the agglomerate . Whatever you put in front of me , I can fix it . You must not let them intimidate you with all the user manuals , think beyond , throw them away , . - Want some ? - What is it ? Blue koke . Jimmy ... Our angel is getting ready ? Except you must promise me you will give me ground contact . Now those bustards use devils of a third generation ... - supersonic . - We need a deadly virus , a signal that can totally escape their codes . - You want something that won 't identify . - All right . So , who has got the ZAP . - Avinash , for example . - Right , Avinash , I forgot . We 'll have to go to Bombay-city . That 's if I can stay awake . What ? Are you all right ? It 's just the girl ... left me a year ago and went to Bombay-city . I can 't find her , - she doesn 't answer on the web . - I will go to sleep . Good night ! What the hell ? I must have nodded off . - How is it going , Naima ? - Pretty good . They thought we were a telephone call . It 's better than nothing . That will hold them for a while . It 's better than nothing ... Hi there , how is it coming ? You still feel cold ? No , I fell better now . You will never know how much I would like you to be me and me you . We 'll always be near anyhow ... we are like two pees in a pod , Jimmy . Maybe somebody was leading me by the hand through all this . Maybe , it was somehow decided from the very start that I should go to Bombay-city . It 's like squaring a circle . I have to find a formula , the root . Lisa is there waiting . That 's all that smoking that it doing it . Roll effects are murderous . - You 've got to take it in small dozes . - I want to sleep . Not here in Bombay-city . - I am too tired . - We are almost there . Who are they ? The organ hunters . - They think the girl is sick . They are after us because they think that Naima is sick . - Come on , Naima , wake up . These animals ... - Wake up . Wake up . Talk to me , Naima . Have you always lived here ? - I don 't know . - Of course you were . Where were you born ? - I don 't recall . - That 's not possible . Everyone knows that . I only recall this last year . That 's true , that 's because of these machines for cerebral hook-ups . Are you still around , bug eyes , go bust somebody else for a while ! You screw the launch procedure , you will be like her . Her brain and computer locked ... and shortened each other out , destroying her memory . Doctors tried messing with her , that 's why she 's got this hole in the middle of her head . Damned electro-medics ! Now , she 's only got artificial recollection , right ? - I want some sleep , I can 't walk anymore . She is healthy ! Mind and body ! Look how healthy we are ! I told you she is healthy . - Go to hell ! - Let 's go , Naima . Hey , sister angel ! Come on , we are almost there . What is wrong with the girl ? Nothing , she is just tired . She has been awake for three days and three nights , she 's got to take a nap . - Very busy in the center ? - It 's boiling ... - Hold her . - Yeah , we are near the thermo heating unit . They heat us and we drip ... - Here is the key to your room . - Thanks . - Pay in advance . - Jimmy , pay . No , no . No chips , cash . Cash ? Here in Bombay city ? - This is good , good as cash . - It 's even better ... - The rooms are down the hall . - Ok , baby , we go to beddy . Fleeing from the pursuing tiger , the man draws to the edge of abyss . He grasps the root and hangs over the edge . His odor of doom reaches the tiger . Lowering his eyes , he looks upon ... yet another tiger that is looking up . Now , when he hangs on the edge , a rat and a weasel are chewing his wrists . Then , while he was looking all around , he suddenly saw a strawberry close to his face . ... like a rose . He puts his hungry mouth upon it . It was sweet and juicy . Better get started ; we have an appointment . - What time is it ? - It 's already four o 'clock ; we have to go and look for Avinash . Ok , I will be in a minute . There is something you should know ... It 's not that I have no need for money , but there are other reasons for what I do . Such as ? Karma-yoga . Action , you know ... Always giving the utmost , outwitting the impossible ... towards a better world . Whatever you motives , I am very lucky that you are here with us . You remember nothing of your past life ? All my thoughts are in computers ... There is something ... something I am not sure about , because I don 't ' recall ... But you are the first person that seems to move me . They could be others , I don 't know ... But it 's you I remember ... I will go up now . You come , too . Jimmy ? Are you all right ? Yeah , but you got to do me a favor . It has to do with Maria . I can 't make her understand . - There has got to be a way to make her realize ... - It 's in opposition to the game , but I will try . Do you remember the house at the beginning of the story ? There is a hidden exit I used to make quick changes . Once there , you can browse through the whole program . You won 't be able to come out of it , but you won 't have to be a player . - Where is this exit ? - Where you hang your pants at night . In the closet ? In the closet . Joy and Avinash worked together even when Gandi Simpson dissolved himself . Now he is ashamed to go to Avinash with his eyes . Come . There he is ... Old mechanics never die , hah ? - How are you doing ? - This is Jimmy , our buddy . - Why did you come to Bombay ? - We need a virus , something new that can 't be decoded . Something indefinable . Joystick wants to start flying again ? He needs money , Rajiv , terribly bad ! No-one is surfing , or flying these days . If money is your goal , you are likely to fail . Put it in your pocket . Don 't just stand there ! Did that man who was running away give you something ? No . He says , " you 'll have to be searched " . First tell him that I am a programmer from " Okosama Star " and that we are friends . This is my id-converter . He told you to go away from here . Is it true that you are a programme for " Okosama Star ? " - I was a programmer . - This doesn 't matter . You bring this chip to Svamigi Ashram . Then ask him ... what you want . They have already given us access . - Are you Ok , Jimmy ? - Yeah . Oh , Lisa . I wish I could see her once more ... and ask her how she is . Has she found what she was looking for ? It 's been a while since I felt it so close ... And now what ? We were in Bombay city ... in the very bowls of the agglomerate , where reasons have no place , and where the past , present and future ... dance together . Babaji , a friend has need of you . This chip was given to me . You are Jimmy ? yes . Our Svami has something to show you . He is wanted by every law enforcement agency on the planet . They put a micro transmitter in his head , so that when he is a phase of active thought , he canl be traced immediately . And the chip you brought us is a piece of software ... stolen from the " Suchong " psycho lab . It will help him keep in this state , that 's all we can do until the transmitter is removed . - So , he is continuously dreaming ? - Exactly . If he dreams , he doesn 't think . If he doesn 't think the transmitter is also dormant . His continuous drowsing outwits their thought detectors . Why is it , brother Jimmy , that you show up only now ? We need to program a virus . We could leave an offering to your Ashram . How come you call me brother Jimmy when I don 't even know you ? We know all about you . Or , at least , all that Lisa told us . She is here , right ? Not as you mean it . You will have all you need delivered to the " Hanga " hotel . But now you must meet with the Swami . Lisa died ... four months ago . She was already ill , when she came here . She was here for six months . We were working well , and she seemed quite happy . When her condition got worse , we decided to link up with each other . She would upload me entire segments of her life . This is Lisa 's memory : her fears , her desires , colors , odors , it 's an aurovedic microchip . You are the only person I feel I can entrust it to . No data processor can read it . You must find a receiver . A receiver ? A human being with a psychic port . Your young friend has one over her eyebrow . You know what it 's like each time I die ? I sit there waiting to start over from scratch . So agonizing ... suspense , anxiety , ... to start again ... with no desire , balancing between life and death . It 's more or less the same with the dead in your world . They like to watch the living weep over them . And they get lazy , you know , as if tied down . Then they loose the will to start over . It 's gone . And so , little by little , the living stop crying , turn their thoughts elsewhere inevitably . There is no longer any point and sense in remaining there . They are bored to tears . So , they muster up new strength , and start a life all over . That 's what you should do . Find new strength to liberate your Lisa , ease her out . You are oversimplifying , believe me . - What are you doing there ? - Waiting for Maria . She wants to see through the closet panel . I always see Lisa everywhere , - The trouble is I don 't know how to find her. I - Mister Solo , how do I get up there ? Use the stairs . It 's her . Look , I don 't usually do clients ... in private houses . Don Nikola would get pretty mad , if he knew . - I could get my ass kicked . - What do you say ? No , it 's nothing personal , it 's just ... that here in Chinatown with all these nuts crawling , masochists and all kinds of ... You needn 't be afraid of me , I am fairly normal . You needn 't be . Do you mind if I tell you a story ? What story ? Don 't you wanna bang ? It 's as if I said yes ... You see that cupboard ? - The closet ? - Yeah . Forget about that ; we 'll leave that for later . Look at me . What would it be like if you heard someone say ... you are not a human being ? - Just let me out of here . - No , no , no ... It 's a chip of a cerebral implant . I 've used them . But never with memory attributed to humans . It 's quite the same technically ... What you are planning is far out . - You know that ? - Yes . Ok . What do we do now ? Try to test it . I 'll give you a date ... The third of March last year . On the third I went away ... I withdrew all the money we had : both mine and yours . I didn 't know how to leave you . With what intention with that pathetic message on that video , or the money I took . - No , stop it , it 's too painful . - Wait ... The 14 palms . The " Desert " motel , you were so ... sad , uneasy . No matter what I said , or did , nothing worked . Then , the next morning at dawn , you went walking through the desert . The sun was still low , when you came back . Flooding our room with a pink glow . And your absurd story of the coyote . It 's ridiculous ! They were never present here . Look , we ve 'been through this before . If I say I saw a coyote in the desert , it 's because I saw it , but you don 't understand . You can 't understand it ! - " Wild Side " . - Restaurant , Amsterdam . But I am not too sure what we did that night . Doesn 't matter ; it was a great night with a Croatian rock group . Lots of smoke . No , fog , all along the bank . - Right . - Arm in arm along the canal . - That was the nigh I told you about Ignatius . - Exactly . You recall the barmen , the face of the barmen ... Yeah . He was the guy who sent us to the " Dark Pink " . In the quarter they call " The Polish Bank " . And you had this made ... for me . Come on , do it for me . Take a look through the panel . There is no-one there . It 's just a closet with hangers , pants , jackets , old clothes . Why don 't you take a look ? Ok . I think , though , there is something wrong with your head . Are you ready ? - And now what ? - Sorry ! Our world ends here . We are like two fish in a bowl ; they think they are in the sea , but ... - Maybe Jimmy can cancel us out ... - Out of what ? Out of this problem . It 's getting late , if you don 't want to bang , I will be running along now . I 've got so much to do at the house . Don Nilola may show up , and there is the whole place to tidy yet , - and I have to prepare dinner ! - You are talking nonsense ! You put your nose out there ; you saw it . What have I seen ? There is no end to the visual effects you find nowadays , making things appear as they exist in reality , making things that don 't exist ! - What I saw could very well be false . - But it isn 't . It 's your life that 's fake . Must you keep seeing me ? Don 't call me again , please . Hey , amigo , your batteries are running low ? Why don 't you accelerate you blood pressure with mega paranoia ? We swap paranoias ? No ? Well , it 's obvious that I 've done it before . It 's with whom that I don 't remember . In a certain sense , you had already done it with me . How does Lisa 's memory enter your senses ? Not very fluidly . At least not yet . It 's more like a computer : you call up a detail and now comes a window . But you were making love to me , not her . There is still a couple of things I would like you to pull out . No , not now . Exactly . Not now . As you know , Jimmy-san , Christmas is tomorrow . I am sure that " Okosama Star " is ready to forget the past . What a pleasure to have found you , Jimmy-san . It would have been tragic otherwise . What a luck you began using your credit card again . How did you make out with that psychopathic Thai girl ? - Was she as good as they said ? - No , she wasn 't . No , she wasn 't . I was assaulted by a bunch of perverts . I no more close my eyes , Jimmy-san . With those atrocities printed in my memory ! I will do company therapy ... We need him alive , don 't shoot him . Look , do what you want , but , please , don 't start shouting . - I am an authorized sexual stimulator . - Ok , Ok . My chip is in order ! I can 't see , I can 't see ! I can 't see ! Stop it ! I was doing meditation . How disgusting . Let 's go ! All is well ? And here I am , " Chelsea " hotel , room 717 . - " The Indian Virus " is working . And I am about to become an angel . December 23 . 2 : 30 PM . If I don 't delete it now , - " Nirvana " will be duplicated a million times over . - You 've got to believe me ... You must believe me . I lost blood , lots of blood . Don 't think I am afraid . The trouble is I can 't see a shit . Look , I am not afraid of anything and that 's the truth ! You are a good guy , thanks . Ok , Jimmy . Here we go . Now , it 's your turn . - Get us in there , Jimmy boy . - Read me . The virus is putting us through a transformation . We are fax-promoters of " Okosama Star " . - Are you afraid , Jimmy ? - I suppose . Like when we boarded the shuttle for Tokyo ? - More , or less . - Chao . - But then , after return it went great , didn 't it ? - Yeah , right . Well , Jimmy , we are flying now ! What do you see , Jimmy ? - I am flying over a city at night . - That 's the web , Jimmy . It 's your head that picks up the image of a city at night . You 've got good imagination . You see , I always knew you had the talents . Hold on tight now ... Remember , you are faxed from the premises of " Okosama Star " . - Where are we ? - We are in front of a laundry . No , it 's got to be " Okosama Star " . You see what he sees in his head ? Yeah . Find me something more urgent than a fax . Letter of credit issued through their main account ? Very good . This is it , Jimmy . Now , you are gonna drop down into Okosama Star " . And mind , sweety . Once you get inside there , you have a few minutes to get what we need ... and pull the hell out of there . I got you . Entering . We are online with the central observance sector . Seven minutes . Now ! All right . So , now . The moment you open the door , he will immediately know you are an intruder . Of course , our virus screws up his thinking , but he is no jerk ; sooner , or later he figures it out . It 's a race against time , Jimmy . Remember , just as you begin surfing through his circuits , he gets into your head ; he can read what you are thinking . So , from this moment on you are gonna be like water , it slides in , adapts to the curves , and then streams out again . You got me , Jimmy ? Then locate ! Search ! Find ! Choose a door , Jimmy . Jimmy , excuse me , I know it annoys you to see me cry . It 's the devil , the visual illusion that 's eating into your memory . But ever since your mother passed away , I keep thinking of the things I never told her . How we waste those opportunities to exchange the little words of comfort ! a caress . How we take things for granted ! Why is life a repetition of " too little " and " too late " ? Come on . Get out of there . Don 't let him slow you down , Jimmy . There is no time for that . It 's our duty to express our love . - Which door is it ? - I don 't sense it very well , the one down the hall , maybe . I am so lonely ! Where are you going ? You must not leave me alone tonight ! Jimmy ! Hey , we meet again , sir . 610 I see you remember my alias . But you were bad luck for me . They suspended my license for pushing . Goodbye , taxi . - It wasn 't you , was it ? - Don 't even answer him . You are part of a game . You are not here . Speak for yourself . Somebody real with a job like yours would not screw up like that . He 's entered your mind , Jimmy . You 've got to clear your mind of all this . Force a clean page , Jimmy . And let the indication of another door come to you ! An indication is what you want ? Do you want to buy my taxicab , see the world ? Or , do you want to end up in the suburbs ? Don 't listen to him . You are destroying your life , Jimmy . The virus is bugging us , it 's going forward ... - with strange changes . - No , Jimmy ! Don 't go there . Jimmy , you must create a void around you ? He is a lot faster ; don 't try challenging him . Stop projecting thoughts , turn into a receiver , you bustard ! - 4 minutes . He is trying to define us . No thoughts , Jimmy , no dreams . Zero , nothing ! Just breathe and that 's all . Go ! - I think this is it . - Ok . Go , boy . Lisa ! Where were you all this time , Jimmy ? - You left me all alone . - Shit . - That isn 't her , Jimmy . That 's not Lisa ! - I know I hurt you Jimmy . Forgive me . I only cause you trouble . Clear your head of all thoughts , Jimmy . - She is only a projected likeness . - Don 't your apologies come too late ? Would you allow that I make it up to you ? I won 't be a problem . Problems are always . Solving them is love . Get the hell out of there , Jimmy ! You are not talking to Lisa . You are not looking at Lisa ; she is not Lisa ! Listen to me , now ! She is gonna burn you , if you stay there , Jimmy . - Jimmy , she is gonna burn you ; get out of there ! - It 's strange , Jimmy ... I was happy , and yet I didn 't know ... - that you were all I needed . - She hooked him , we 've got to disconnect ! You can 't imagine how often I think of us by these canals ... in Amsterdam . - Happy moments . - She is burning him ! - We don 't often think of them . - Come on , come off . - Like on my birthday ? - I can 't take it . I can 't take it . He is like a kid . - The last one , when we were still together . - Disconect ! Wait a minute . I was sitting in the sun and you came with a hologram from London . I remember you liked that thing so much that I thought that would be a suitable way to say Happy Birthday to you . Then you got closer , kissed me and invited me to lunch . I was wearing your " Sex-pistols " t-shirt . - and we 'd finished already . - We were together . - I was so happy . - I was so down , Jimmy . I felt so frustrated , I could not cope with anything . I was happy , and when you left I put the CD ... - by the " Massive Attack " . - I acted like a crazy . After you left , I took my photo ... - and bashed it on the ground . - My portrait accidentally fell apart . Late I told you that it accidentally fell apart . I am sorry , Jimmy . Is that a fact ? Her memory inside of me is accurate . The computers of " Okosama Star " are doing their best to deceive you . - Then we went to that Chinese restaurant , you remember ? - That 's not Lisa . You are reliving your own recalls . And Lisa is in my head . I should not have left you , Jimmy . I made a mistake . Forgive me . I was so confused . Come back . I am sorry , Jimmy . You were seeing only what you wanted to remember . Ok . - Let 's start negotiating their directory . - That 's the way to go ! Start with opening the door , but without choosing , let instinct guide you . He found it ! We are in the directory ! I love you , Jimmy . You are an angel ! But now you must find the administrative subdirectory , baby . It 's got to be that cube , Jimmy . Yeah , their hidden treasure . There is nothing else in the screen to give it away . Look , there is a fortune inside the cube ! Unaccounted deposits ... - as if they didn 't exist ! - Fantastic ! This my account in hotel " Al Rashid " Marrakesh . We mustn 't make too big a transfer . I will take only what I need for my eyes , - and how about 200 thousand a piece . - Fine with me . - Then , let 's make it 250 . - Ok . - 250 a piece . - Done ! - There is still a pile left ! - Hold it a minute . - I 've got to delete " Nirvana " . - Yeah , don 't worry ; we 'll do everything we have to do . 250 thousand to J Gandy Simpson 's widow . - Done ! - 100 thousand to doctor Rotzenberg . " Fujimaks Marrakech " bank , account number 3-7-6-8-slash-0-1 . - Done ! - Good . The same bank ... account number 6-3-7-2-slash-1 - 1 for Avinish , how is that ? - You are forgetting Ashram in Bombay city . - Yeah . And we have Huanita ... - Who is she ? - Huanita ? A nice girl , - she is good for 80 thousand . - Very good indeed ! There is still a lot left . What do we do ? Take them , or leave them ? No , just burn them and the cube . We could divide them among all the accounts in Marrakech and Bombay city . Divide . Are you crazy , or something ? Can we give this money to people we don 't even know ? What if some shit gets a lot of money for nothing ? - Still better than leaving them here . - Exactly . It 's madness , total madness ! - All that money going to ... - the four winds . Let the sun melt it . Let it mold in water . - It 's very mystic , isn 't it , Joy ? - Yes , you are like a kid ! Wait . Something is wrong ! We 've been located . They know we are here . So , what the hell are we waiting for ? Let 's go . We 've got two minutes to get out of here . Jimmy , Jimmy ! Get out . They are gonna be here any minute . No , Joy . - I have to cancel " Nirvana " . - Come on , we are rich ! Nobody gives a shit , whether or not you cancel your toy . They inserted an oppression code . What about all that money in Marrakech ? - Go , get it ; I 'll stay here . - If you stay here , you are cooked ; they already got your number . They are closing up the sectors . You sure you wanna stay ? Karma-Yoga . Action , outwitting the impossible , remember ? - They are your words . - Ok , iron balls , I know I can 't convince you . But just remember what they did to Gandi Simpson . They want your brain , Jimmy . Thanks , boy . Now I can buy two full color " Zoni " eyes . Thanks , little angel . - Get in touch as soon as you can . - Ok . - Ok , see you in the net . - Sure . I wanted to ask you . Did you really love me ? Who are you asking ? I ask Lisa . The answer is yes . " Jimmy " . - Jimmy ? - Yeah , I cancelled " Nirvana " . You no longer need to play with anybody . I was beginning to doubt you . Well , I did promise . Please , just one moment ... Once I am cancelled , I turn into ... Into what ? A crystal of snow . That 's not too ... too bad . Jimmy-san , we know you are there . Listen to me . You have seriously damaged us . But we can overlook that . And once again start , as if nothing has changed . Jimmy , this means that we 've won ? You will fully reinstate it , Jimmy . We won . Delete everything . Do it . May we enter now ? Naima is on line . If you are ready , start !

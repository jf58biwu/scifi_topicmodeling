 There was blood everywhere . - Whoever killed her is a real psycho . - Murder weapon ? Seven stores in town carry strap razors . Have somebody check them out . - What about the press ? - Just the basics . - No mention of this sister thing to anybody . - Okay . Rubin , I need your final report . Call me as soon as you get it . Yeah , thanks . This is all I can tell you . - The investigation ... - Can you give us a name ? - Yeah , I 'll talk to you . Give us something to go on . We 're doing the best we can . We 'll inform you ... Brian , I need a minute . I 'm working on a homicide investi ... Come on . You didn 't show last night . - This what you wanted to talk about ? - I made dinner . It 's not ... What ? Sorry . Coroner 's on one . Yeah , what do you got , Rubin ? Uh-huh . Uh , hang on a second , will you , Rubin ? This address 10 : 00 tonight . Where 's this ? A motel ? It 's a place we can talk . Any cavities ? I brush after every meal . Would you say they match ? Well , there 's a filling on the occlusal surface ... of the upper left bicuspid , here and here . And he 's congenitally missing a lower left bicuspid here and here . Yeah , I 'd say they 're definitely a match . - Who do they belong to ? - Special Agent Sam Chaney . - That name sounds familiar . - Chaney 's a legend . Forty years before the bureau started profiling violent criminals , Chaney and his partner , Tim Ledbetter , would work on their own time ... investigating what were then called " stranger killings , " what are now called " serial murders . " They disappeared while investigating three murders ... n Aubrey , Missouri in 1942 . Chaney 's body wasn 't found until two days ago ... by a local detective , B.J. Morrow , a woman . What 's your interest in this case ? During their time , Chaney 's and Ledbetter 's ideas ... weren 't very well received by their peers . Using psychology to solve a crime was something like , uh ... - Believing in the paranormal ? - Exactly . But there 's another mystery . - Which is ? - I 'd like to know why ... this policewoman would suddenly drive her car ... into a field the size of Rhode Island , and for no rhyme or reason , dig up the bones of a man who 's been missing for 50 years . I mean , unless there was a neon sign saying , " Dig here ! " I guess that 's why we 're going to Aubrey . Yes , and also , I 've always been intrigued by women named B.J. Detective Morrow , exactly how did you discover the remains ? I witnessed a dog digging in the ground . I pursued it to investigate and found the grave site . The initial police report states that you couldn 't explain your actions at the time . It was late . I was a bit shocked by my discovery . I 'm afraid I didn 't clearly articulate ... exactly what happened for my initial report . What were you doing in the woods at that hour ? My vehicle was experiencing engine failure . You left your car ... Over there , sir . Would you say that 's , uh , 400 or 500 yards ? - Yes , sir . - From that distance , you could see a dog digging in this field at night ? She was taking a short cut through the woods to reach a phone . The path led her through the field . The report says she phoned in from the Motel Black just up the road . That 's not a very short cut . It seems like you 're more interested ... in how the missing agent was found than in how he got there in the first place . You , don 't , uh , suspect her , do you ? No , not at all . I would just like to ask Detective Morrow a few more questions . All right . Have you ever , um ... Have you ever had any clairvoyant experiences , premonitions , visions , precognitive dreams , things like that ? What the hell kind of question is that ? - Dreams ? - Yeah . Look , Agent Mulder , I don 't mean to be rude , but we have a lot to do . If you have any further questions specifically pertaining ... to your investigation of this crime , please feel free to call . Come on , B.J. What do you think ? These bones are in good condition , but I think the field may have been tilled shortly after Chaney was buried . There are small cuts on the top three ribs . I don 't think they were made by an animal . Listen to this , Scully . " One must wonder how these monsters are created . " Chaney wrote this . " Did their home life mold them into creatures that must maim and kill ? Or are they demons from birth ? " That 's poetic , but it doesn 't help us much . What did he say about the 1942 homicides ? Well , the press called the murderer the " Slash Killer . " His three victims were all young women aged 25 to 30 . He disabled them with a blow to the head . He would carve the word " sister " on their chest , and paint it on the wall with their blood . The victims bled to death , and the murderer was never found . Mulder . These cuts on the ribs . They could have been made by a razor . Can you make out a word ? No , but we might be able to ... if we can find somebody in Aubrey who has a digital scanner . I 've scanned the images from the crime photo and the rib cage ... and modemed them to Quanitco . It 's gonna be a few more seconds before the hookup . I checked with the precinct mechanic . B.J. ' s car was just tuned . She lied about experiencing engine failure . Mulder , I don 't think B.J. Was in the woods that night because of engine failure . What are you talking about ? The Motel Black would have been a perfect meeting place . Away from town , away from his wife . - What do you mean ? - It 's obvious . B.J. And Tillman are having an affair . - How do you know ? - A woman senses these things . Oh , God . The image on the right is Chaney 's rib cage . The one on the left was extrapolated from the crime photo ... of the Slash Killer 's last victim . Now I need to ... Enlarge the victim 's rib cage in order to allow for gender difference . And now we can compare them . Could he have craved out another word on his rib cage ? I 'm searching for any matching pattern of cuts . Agent Mulder ? Have you made any progress in the investigation ? Uh , we may have . It seems Agent Chaney ... might have been a victim of the killer he was trying to catch . We 're trying to determine if the cuts on his rib cage spell out a word right now . No ! You all right ? I 'm sorry . Something ... I 'm not feel ... Excuse me . Feeling better ? I 'm fine now . Things must be difficult for you now . I 've had feelings for people I 've worked with . Interoffice relationships can be complicated . Especially when he 's married . You 're pregnant , aren 't you ? Does it show ? No , not yet . Now I know why my mother only had one child . She told me about the nausea , but not about the nightmares . Nightmares ? It 's always the same . I 'm in a house . It feels familiar . There 's ... a woman that 's been hurt . There 's a mirror . I see a man 's reflection . I recognize his face , but I don 't know him . What I remember most is the blood . There 's a lot of blood . Have you talked to anyone about these nightmares ? I 'm sure it 's something about the pregnancy . If anyone else knew I was pregnant ... Brian would kill me if I told anyone . - What are you going to do ? - I don 't know . Well , B.J. ' s pregnant . And Tillman 's the father . Um , I 've approximated the pattern of the cuts to match up with letters . There 's a 93ยบ / ยบ chance that this it the letter " R. " - Um-hmm . - And if you lower the probability to 79ยบ / ยบ , we get the letters " I , " " E " and " R. " It could be a word or it could just be random slashes . If we exhumed one of the Slash Killer 's victims , we could do a C. T. Scan to determine if the cuts ... were made by the same type of instrument . That means getting a court order . It could take a couple of days . - Maybe we could find a relative who could speed up the process . - " Brother . " Excuse me ? I know what it says . On the rib cage , it spells " brother . " You 're right . B.J. ? Brian . What 's going on here , B.J. ? - Nothing . - Really ? Then where 'd you get these ? These are crime scene photos . They were sealed . No one had access to ' em . I think you 're mistaken . Those were shot in 1942 . These are evidence of a homicide that occurred three days ago . No , they 're from a case that Agent Ledbetter and Agent Chaney ... were investigating in 1942 before they disappeared . Three days ago , a young woman was murdered , and the word " sister " was carved into her chest and painted on a wall . Only myself , the coroner and one of my men knew about this . Excuse me , sir . We just got a call . There 's been another one . Watch your step , sir . The victim 's name is Verna Johnson . Oh , my God . - B.J. ? - It 's her . It 's the woman in my dream . Ow ! Ow ! Honey , you 're fine . The mothering instinct . I 've been feeling it a lot lately . I used to hate it when my mother hovered over me . I swore I 'd never be like her . I think we all feel that way at one time or another . My father was a cop . A good cop . That 's all I ever wanted to be . He 'd say what we 're doing here is nonsense , that you can 't solve a crime from a dream . Well , I 've often felt that dreams are answers to questions ... we haven 't yet figured out how to ask . You said you were in a familiar house ? There 's a woman that 's been hurt . I look in a mirror , and I see a man 's reflection . - What does he look like ? - He 's ... got a rash on his face , and his eyes are ... intense . Do you remember anything else ? Is that ... There 's this ... strange picture on the wall behind him . It 's a building like the Washington Monument , but different . And there 's a ... A big circular thing beside it . - Do you think you could draw it ? - Sure . It looked something like this . What do you think it is ? - I don 't know . - It could be the Trylon and the Perisphere . - Have you ever been to New York City ? - No , never . You can get pictures of these on postcards all over Times Square . These were the symbols of the 1939 World 's Fair . - Do you know why they might have been in your dream ? - No idea at all . Good night , Gordon . You 're here kinda late . - What are you lookin ' for ? - Just wanted to check on something . I don 't get it . That book 's from the 1940s . Can we talk ? You know , I 'm willing to go with you ... for the appointment . I 'm not so sure it 's what I want to do . I thought we agreed that it was the best thing for both of us . - I changed my mind . - What do you mean , you changed your mind ? You can 't just change your mind . This isn 't your decision . It 's our decision . B.J. It 's him . Brian . I have to go . This is the man B.J. Claims to have seen in her dream . Harry Cokely . He lives in Gainsville , Nebraska since his release ... from McCallister Penitentiary on December 5 , 1993 . He was convicted in 1945 for rape and attempted murder . Cokely carved " sister " on the chest of his victim , Linda Thibedeaux , before she was able to escape and get help from a neighbor . And the police never made the connection to the 1942 homicides ? - No . - I don 't want to jump to any rash conclusions , but I 'd say he 's definitely our prime suspect . Mulder , the man we 're talking about is 77 years old . George Foreman won the heavyweight crown at 45 . Some people are late bloomers . Anyway , this still doesn 't explain B.J. ' s connection to all this . What if it 's cryptomnesia ? You mean consciously forgotten information ? Yeah . B.J. Told us her father was a policeman in the area . What if ... she heard him discussing the 1942 case when she was young ? She might have even seen pictures of Cokely . That still doesn 't explain why she would go into a field ... and unearth the grave of an F.B.I. Agent . What if the recent murders triggered what was previously buried in her mind ? Some connection she 'd unconsciously made that no one else had been able to make ? - You mean a hunch ? - Yeah , something like that . - That 's a pretty extreme hunch . - I seem to recall you having some pretty extreme hunches . - That 's a pretty extreme hunch . - I seem to recall you having some pretty extreme hunches . I never have . Harry Cokely ? - Yeah ? - I 'm Special Agent Mulder . This is Special Agent Scully . We 're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation . May we come in ? Indistinct ] - [ Scully ] Mr. Cokely , our records show ... - that in 1942 you lived in Terrance , Nebraska , An hour 's drive away from Aubrey , Missouri . During that time , three women were murdered in Aubrey . There assailant had mutilated their bodies with a razor ... in the same manner that you slashed Mrs. Linda Thibedeaux 's body ... in 1945 . I don 't remember much about that . Well , I 'm sure Mrs. Thibedeaux will never forget it . The doctors said I was sick back then . They give me some pills . I served my time , and ... now I 'm better . What kind of pills ? Red and white ones , little sister . Do you recognize this man ? His name 's Chaney . - No . - He was an F.B.I. Agent ... who was also murdered in Aubrey in 1942 . Can you tell me where you were about 8 : 35 p. m . Two nights ago , Mr. Cokely ? Sittin ' right where I am now . Do you have a witness to testify to that ? Are you blind ? I can 't leave the house without this damn thing . I sit right here in front of that TV 24 hours a day . And on the night you 're talkin ' about , I was sittin ' here watchin a show about a lost dog . - Then after that , it was a show about ... - That won 't be necessary . Good . Now , are you about finished with me , little sister ? For now . I saw it was a woman . She seemed to be in trouble , but when I opened the door , she just barged in and came running down the stairs . So I called the police . He 's here ! He 's here ! B.J. , what happened ? - Oh , my God . - He 's here . I 'm taking her to the hospital . Thank you . I 'll leave a message for dietary ... I thought you might need these . Thanks . You hurt yourself . Can you tell us what happened , B.J. ? Cokely . He was in the room . - Cokely attacked you ? - Yes . He must have done this while I was asleep . - You 're sure it was him ? - I know it was him . I saw his reflection in the mirror . He looked just like his picture . - Like his mug shot ? - Yes . That 's the picture of a young man . But it was Cokely . I swear it was him . I 'll have Tillman pick him up . Where were you last night ? Honolulu . You were in Aubrey , weren 't you ? How 'd you get into Detective Morrow 's house ? It 's all I can do to get to the bathroom , you damn fool . The victim has identified you , Mr. Cokely . I 've already paid for my crime . Well , I 'm gonna see that you pay more . I never touched that woman ! And I 'm not answering anymore questions without a lawyer . Now get me a lawyer . Mulder ? It 's open . I have the preliminary results from the genetic testing ... from the blood found under Verna Johnson 's nails . They checked it against Cokely 's . The P.G.M. Subtype matches . - The D-Q-Alpha and the D-1-S-80 are the same . - It 's Cokely 's blood ? The results strongly suggest that . Imagine the strength of this man 's psychosis , still driving him to murder after 50 years . But for some reason , he let B.J. Live . Well , she 's not the first . Mrs. Thibedeaux also survived his attack back in 1945 . I think it 's time we paid a visit to Mrs. Thibedeaux . That was taken three weeks before it happened . I haven 't had a picture taken since . Is this your husband ? That 's , uh , Martin . He was a good man . He passed lastJune . If it hadn 't been for him , I never would have survived . I know this goes back a long way , Mrs. Thibedeaux , but could you tell us what happened the night Harry Cokely attacked you ? Well , it happened ... out there on the landing . I remember how the light from the window ... bounced off the razor . L - It had an ivory handle . He-He kept saying , " Someone 's got to take the blame , little sister , and it isn 't gonna be me . " They tried to explain at the trial how his father used to beat him , and how he was the only son ... in a family of five daughters . And how he was brutally punished for everything wrong that happened . But if you ask me , that man was born evil . No children ? No . None . Mrs. Thibedeaux , our records show ... that you recuperated from your injuries within two months . But nine months later , you checked back into the hospital . Well , I had complications . What happened to the child ? Cokely 's child . Martin used to say ... not to blame the child . That it was just ... a little thing , an innocent . But it was the spawn of evil . I couldn 't keep it ... in this house . The memory of him . Mrs. Thibedeaux ? I ... gave the baby to an adoption agency . Baby . He 'd be almost 50 now . This is the , uh , address of the adoption agency . If you do find him ... No . No , never mind . The bones B.J. Found under the house ... belong to Chaney 's partner , Agent Ledbetter . Cokely rented the house in 1942 . The detectives at the crime scene found an old straight razor under the house . They 're trying to lift some prints . Cokely 's been released , but I think we have enough to nail him . Something just doesn 't track , Scully . The night she was attacked , B.J. Said she saw a younger man . Yeah , but you know the state of mind she was in that night . - She could have been mistaken . Maybe she did see a younger man . Young Cokely . Cokely 's grandson . Are you saying Cokely 's grandson attacked B.J. ? It would make sense , Scully . Genetic traits often skip a generation . That would explain the test results ... of the blood found under Verna Johnson 's fingernails . P.G. M subtypes are similar among relatives . Did Danny call back with the adoption records yet ? Did you get ' em ? I don 't think Mendel had serial killers in mind ... when he developed his theory on genetics . When I was a kid , I would have nightmares . I 'd wake up in the middle of the night ... thinking I was the only person left in the world . Then I would hear this . What ? My dad would be in the study eating these . Yeah . Danny Valadeo . It 's Agent Scully . - What does that have to do with Cokely ? - On a basic cellular level , we 're the sum total of all our ancestors ' biological matter . But what if more than biological traits get passed down from generation to generation ? What if I like sunflower seeds because I 'm genetically predisposed to liking them ? But children aren 't born liking sunflower seeds . Environments shape them . Behavior patterns are taught . There are countless stories of twins separated at birth who end up in the same occupation , marrying the same kind of people , each naming their child Waldo . - Waldo ? - Jung wrote about it ... when he talked about the collective unconscious . It 's genetic memory , Scully . Yeah , Danny . Yeah . Thanks . I 'll tell him . Danny tracked down Mrs. Thibedeaux 's son . He was a policeman named Raymond Morrow . - That 's B.J. ' s father . - B.J. Is Cokely 's granddaughter . - She 's responsible for the murders . - Mulder . Get your coat . Let 's go . Wait , Mulder . Do you honestly think that B.J. ' s capable of murder ? No , but Cokely is , and that 's who B.J. Has become . - That 's outrageous . - Scully , this is what I think . I think that Cokely 's memories , his compulsions , have been passed on genetically to his granddaughter . - That 's driving her to kill . - You 're saying B.J. ' s nightmares are real ? - She 's killing these women and carving " sister " on them ? - Yes . - How do you explain the cuts on her own chest ? - I can 't explain everything . Maybe she carved them . Maybe it 's some kind of weird stigmata . Whatever it is , B.J. Is not herself . - Where are we going ? - We have to warn Mrs. Thibedeaux . If B.J. Has , in the sense that I 'm talking about , to become Cokely , she might be trying to finish what Cokely started . Stop it ! - Somebody 's gotta take the blame , little sister . - No ! No , no ! You 're not him ! You can 't be . And it 's not gonna be me . I 'm not afraid to use this . You have his eyes . You 're ... him ! No . You 're my grandchild . - Do you know what you 're doing ? - Shut up ! He 's done this to both of us . No ! You don 't know what you 're doing ! He 's the one to blame ! Mrs. Thibedeaux ! Mrs. Thibedeaux ! Mulder . Mrs. Thibedeaux . - What happened ? - She had a razor . She tried to kill me . But something stopped her . - Where did she go ? - I don 't know . - Can you stand ? Here . - I ... I think so . - Let me help you upstairs . - Thank you . This is Agent Mulder . I need an ambulance to 238 North 54th Street . I also need an A.P.B. On B.J. Morrow . Yes , that 's Detective Morrow . She should be considered armed and dangerous . B.J. ' s going after Tillman . The first murder occurred after B.J. Found out she was pregnant . She 's looking for someone to blame . I think that 's Tillman . I don 't think so . If she 's going after anyone , it 'll be Cokely . - Why ? - She 's probably figured out that Cokely 's her grandfather . If she 's looking for someone to blame , it 'll be him . Cokely 's not answering his phone . I 'm going over there . - Agent Scully , I 've gotta talk to you . - We 're getting a statement . - You 've accused B.J. Of murder ? - Can we talk outside ? No , here ! Now ! - Have you seen Detective Morrow ? - No , I have not . I don 't care what you 've accused her of . Detective Morrow could not hurt anybody ! Detective Morrow broke into this woman 's house and attacked her with a razor . - I do not believe that ! - It 's true . It happened . Hildy , I only acted like any husband who didn 't want to see his home broken up . - What home ? - Don 't you remember the home I promised you ? Sure . The one we were to have right after the honeymoon . The honeymoon . Is it my fault the coal mine had a cave-in ? I intended to be with you on our honeymoon , Hildy , honest . All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom , I spent two weeks in a coal mine . Continues , Indistinct ] Off ] Who 's there ? Cokely ? Who 's there ? No . How does it feel to be on the other side of the razor , brother ? Stop ! No . No ! Please , no ! You know the rules . This doesn 't stop till you 're dead . Cokely ! Cokely ! - No . Don 't . - B.J. - Don 't . - Don 't . No ! This time you 'll stay dead . - Freeze ! - B.J. ! - What are you doing ? - Let him go . Let him go , B.J. - I 'm not B.J. - Yes , you are . He 's dead . Come on , come on . It 's all right . Everything 's gonna be all right . It 's gonna be okay . We are continuing with genetic testing on Detective Morrow . Evidence suggests the presence of a mutator gene ... that has activated previously dormant genes . But the results so far are inconclusive . Detective Morrow has not demonstrated any further physiological changes . - Extensive blood work and psychological testing ... has been conducted in order to determine ... whether the pregnancy could have been a catalyst for the transformation . We have yet to determine the effects on the fetus . Amniocentesis results show no genetic abnormalities . Chromosome testing has determined the child 's sex to be male . B.J. Is on her second week of suicide watch ... after an unsuccessful attempt to abort her son . Lieutenant Tillman has petitioned to adopt the child , and the case will soon be presented to the courts .

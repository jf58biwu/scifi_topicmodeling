 [ Driver ] Express will be in 20 minutes . Next local in 25 . [ Jarod ] Bye . [ Laughs ] I love that song . Hey , what happens when you get to " zero bottles of beer on the wall " ? Excuse me . Hmm . " Twin ... kies . " - [ Chuckles ] They come two in a pack . - [ Man ] Yeah . Would you sell this for , uh ... twenty dollars ? Thank you . Hmm . This is fascinating . Cake with frosting injected inside . - Hmm . - Technically , it 's filling . Whatever it is , it 's tasty . [ Chuckles ] I 'm Jarod . Dan Healy . Hi , Dan . Is that your family ? My wife , Susan , my son Todd . Just made All-Conference third straight year . Hmm . You must be very proud . They 're my whole life . How about you ? Any family photos ? Um , yes . Um , this is my mother . This is my brother . And this belonged to my father . Distinguished Flying Cross . He gave it to my brother , and my brother passed it on to me . A flying ace for a father . Are you close ? I was separated from my family when I was a-a boy . I 'm searching for them . - I hope you find ' em , Jarod . - Thank you . That 's the express . It doesn 't stop here . Just remember : There 's nothin more important than family . - No ! - [ Brakes Screeching ] [ Grunts ] - No . ! - [ People Chattering ] - [ Man ] What 's the matter with him ? - [ Groaning ] Stay with me . Stay with me . Somebody call an ambulance ! [ Man ] Yeah , yeah . I 'll take care of it . I let ' em down , Jarod . I let ' em all down . [ Jarod ] No . ! No . ! No . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Chattering ] [ Sobbing ] Jesus ! Oh , Jesus ! Danny , please ! Danny . Danny . [ Sobbing ] [ Police Radio Chatter ] [ Sobbing ] Oh , Danny . How is he ? He 's alive , thanks to you . You should 've been a paramedic . He 's still unconscious , but he 's stable . [ Jarod ] His family . They seem like good people . Why the hell would a guy do this ? I don 't know . [ Sobbing ] Please . Please . [ Man ] Okay , let 's put him in the ambulance . Ma 'am , you should ride with us . [ Ambulance Doors Closing , Engine Starting ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Young Sydney ] Is suicide the answer ? I set myself on fire because I 'm convinced it 'll send a message , Sydney . It 'll stop the war . We understand that . But what are you feeling ? Stay with the simulation , Jarod . But he had people who loved him . [ Sighs ] How could he do that to them ? [ Young Sydney ] That 's not significant to the simulation . Family 's important to everyone , Sydney . What he 's doing won 't stop the war . It 'll just destroy a family . Why would someone wanna do this ? Jarod , suicide 's not just an action . It 's a cry for help . - [ Beeps ] - [ Sighs ] I only hope I can . [ Woman ] Questions remain about a deadly spill inside ECS ... a private firm specializing in hazardous materials cleanup . We 've obtained exclusive fire department footage ... taken immediately after a container ... of deadly MZT foam ruptured during routine storage . Three ECS workers were killed when the concentrated pesticide ... burned through their lungs and paralyzed their nervous systems . ECS spokesperson Curt Wilkes . ECS is engaged in a full and thorough investigation of this tragedy . Our hearts go out to the families of those employees lost . [ Reporter ] We caught up to ECS engineer Dan Healy . - Any response on the deaths of these workers ? - Not now . - They were my friends . - People deserve answers , Mr. Healy . - They were my friends . - Yes , but are they dead because of you ? I tested the seal . They were my friends . I let them down . [ Jarod , Reading ] " Dear Susan and Todd ' " - [ Dan 's Voice ] " I have failed you as a husband and a father ... " Just as I failed my friends and coworkers . " I 'm sorry for the nightmare I 've made of your lives . You deserve better . Love , Dan . ' " [ Woman ] Welcome to ECS , Jarod . I read in my orientation packet that the company amassed ... a $ 75 million profit last year . Yep . And that Taiwanese tanker we just pumped free of bilge and crude ... their shipping line is one of our biggest clients . [ Jarod ] This is very interesting . You process the waste through this system . What comes out is highly concentrated . And highly deadly . We secure the waste , we seal it in these level " A " containers ... and then we ship it off to some salt mine in Nevada ... where it won 't give anybody any trouble for a while . High-grade polyethylene container . It should last about 20,000 years . - Yeah . Dick Clark will be the only one around to open it . - [ Woman ] Funny , Strickland . Do you have any recommendations on how we seal this crude ? It 's highly combustible , highly toxic . Since it 's in a level " A " container , I would suggest ... a double-polymer neoprene and graphite seal . That 's the right box , wrong ribbon . We 're going back to the black anti-corrosive polymer seal . The red ones Dan Healy designed . It 's no longer in use . Because of the MZT accident ? [ Woman ] Yeah . Wear this . As a remembrance ? And a reminder . [ Whistling ] Good morning , Miss Parker . - Broots . - Sydney . You 're looking ... refreshed . New underpants will do that to you . - [ Chuckles ] - Sydney , you made a funny . Stole it , I 'm afraid . - Last night , I went on a date . - You had a date ? That 's when two people actually meet instead ... of typing to each other on a computer keyboard . So , if it was a date , how can you be sure that those are your underpants ? Bernice and I went to this amusing little place . The Chocolate . [ Both Laugh ] You , uh-You-You went to a comedy club ? New experiences keep my psychiatric skills finely tuned . - Not to mention that slam-bang wit . - Exactly ! How many psychiatrists does it take to change one lightbulb ? Oh , wait , wait . Wait , wait . Oh , oh , oh , oh . Uh - Uh-Wait , wait . Okay , go ahead . Tell us . Wait , wait . Oh , wait , wait , wait . Oh , oh , oh , oh . Wait . Don 't tell us . Sydney , you 're supposed to say the punch line ... now . Sydney ? I got the transpo report for you , Gibbs . Forty-seven containers . Almost a record . Check this out . You 're a funny guy , Strickland . Gotcha ! [ Laughs ] Have a little respect , will ya ? People died here a few weeks ago . Easy , Hunsaker . They were my friends too . Hell , Larry taught me that gag . He would 've thought it was funny . [ Wilkes ] You eat that stuff ? They 're very good . Food of the gods . - Dupont , right ? - Uh , yes , that 's me . M.I.T. , Exxon Valdez , Kuwait . It takes a long time to build that kind of résumé . Well , actually , I typed it in four minutes . [ Wilkes Chuckles ] That 's funny . I 'm Curt Wilkes , Media Relations . Nice to meet you . I just , uh , came down here to make clear that no ECS employee ... under any circumstances , is to discuss the MZTaccident with the press . They 're makin ' a meal out of , uh , Dan Healy 's suicide attempt . I wonder how that happened . Dan will have his say when and if he regains consciousness . Don 't give the state a reason to railroad him . Got it ? Oh , he doesn 't want Dan railroaded ? He 's the conductor . [ Sam ] This is not good . I want you to sweep the Centre for Sydney . Every corner in every room on every sublevel . If he walked out , I want the sign-out sheet . And , Sam , be low key . Yes , Miss Parker . This is-This is really quacked . It 's the Centre , Broots . People have a tendency to vanish . Like Mr. Lyle . - Have you ever seen Sydney lose it like this before ? - Once . Really ? Over what ? It was personal . I hope he 's okay . Do you think - Do you think he 's okay ? You tell me . [ Chattering ] [ Man 's Voice , Distant ] Help . ! Help . ! Somebody , please . ! Oh , God . ! Larry , help me . ! You saw them die , didn 't you ? It was like nothing I 've ever seen . They were hoisting the container up in the truck . - The first one just blew . - [ Sighs ] No one was wearing their protective gear ? Hunsaker had signaled it " all clear . " The MZT took about 20 seconds to turn their insides into mush . I hit the alarm , and I ran in there with Strickland ... but by the time we got in there ... it had already eaten through them . They never had a chance . [ Sighs ] You know , Dan was so careful . He worked on this for three years . Tested and re-tested this . Not against MZT . It doesn 't make any sense . Is that why you defend him in front of Wilkes ? Oh , that snake only cares about the corporate image . You know , Dan was devastated . He shouldn 't go down for doin ' his job . [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Standard , report to Pathology . Dr. Standard to Pathology . - He needs to see you . - Ma , I can 't . Todd . Todd , please . No , I 'm not goin ' in there ! Excuse me . - Oh , um - - l-I fixed it for him . You were at the bus bench . You helped Dan . Hi. l-I didn 't get a chance to thank you . - I 'm Jarod . - Susan . Hi , Susan . How is he doing ? Oh , uh , the doctors won 't know for a while . He may never , uh - Is that your son ? Todd , right ? - Yeah , Todd . - Dan talked about him . He doesn 't wanna see his father . I don 't know why I 'm bothering you with our problems . Sometimes it 's nice to talk to someone who isn 't a reporter . Mmm . Every day , those vultures asking ' ... did his father kill those people . I think he 's starting to believe it . [ Broots ] This is a very bad idea . If Mr. Raines finds out we got Angelo to help us , he 's gonna ask questions . Uncle Fester will never know Lurch was missing . How long do you think it 's gonna take him to feel what Sydney was feeling ? [ Grunts , Yells ] That answer your question ? [ Grunts ] Jarod drew this . Who is he ? [ Groaning ] [ Broots ] " Le Morte . " Who 's Le Morte ? The one who brings death . [ Gibbs On Radio ] This is ECS 24 , pulling up now to the accident site . ECS tanker warning indicators are telling me it 's got a full load of trypto-chlorinol . [ Strickland ] Geez , look at all the fumes . [ Hunsaker ] We got us a major core leak . We 'll attempt an on-site depressurization . - Anyone call the paramedics ? - I 'll make sure . [ Strickland ] Pressure tank indicates 3,000 and rising fast . [ Hunsaker ] This sucker 's gonna blow if we don 't pump fast . - Update me . - Uh , it 's already up to 4,000 . Come on , Hunsaker . ! Latch on . ! - Are you okay ? - My mommy 's in there ! Dupont , let the paramedics take care of him ! - [ Strickland ] Forty-five hundred . - I 'm going to help your mom . [ Jarod ] Gibbs . ! Get him out ofhere . [ Strickland ] 4,750 and rising . Let 's go . ! Come on . ! Latch on , Hunsaker . ! - Can you hear me ? - [ Strickland ] Five thousand . You 're going to be okay . - I 'm going to help you . - Fifty-two hundred . Are you suicidal ? Dupont , put that suit back on . - She 's pinned in the car . The fumes are gonna kill her . - 5,700 . ! [ Hunsaker ] If this tanker goes up , we and half of Alameda County are history . Fifty-eight hundred . ! Come on , people . ! Your son is okay . Now , breathe into this . Sixty-three hundred . Sixty-five hundred . Pop this pimple , or it 's gonna get ugly ! [ Grunts ] Sixty-three hundred . ! Comin 'down . - Oh , God , I love this job ! - [ Cheering ] [ Gibbs ] All right . ! Yeah . ! - One of our senior Expeditors ? - [ Broots ] Uh , no , actually . He 's an optometrist from upstate New York . His name is Martin Zeller . He has a little office on Main Street . He wrote out 253 eyeglass prescriptions last year ... and gives out little lemon lollipops . Sydney freaked out over Floyd the Barber ? [ Sighs ] Well , just before this was taken ... he was on this elevator . The Tower elevator . So , he 's probably a client . Let me seeJarod 's sketch again . [ Broots ] It 's gone . - Hey , Todd . - Look , no comment . - I 'm not a reporter . - Then what do you want ? I came here to tell you that I think your father is innocent . I guess that 's why he jumped in front of a bus . Man , get out of my face . I was with him on the bench . You 're the guy who saved his life ? I wish I could have moved faster . My father didn 't care about his life or ours . Why should you ? [ Air Hissing ] Nothing . Nineteen bottles ofbeer on the wall Nineteen bottles of beer If one of the bottles should happen to fall [ Humming ] - What 's in that ? - MZT . - Are you crazy ? - Relax . Dan 's seal is holding . - It is ? - Yes . And it has been for the last five hours . The accident wasn 't Dan 's fault . He didn 't kill Larry Meyers . Well , if he didn 't , who did ? Eighteen bottles of beer on the wall Eighteen bottles ofbeer [ Humming ] [ Electronic Voice ] You have new mail . [ Young Jarod ] Is this the man ? [ Young Sydney ] No , no , no ! The eyes are wrong . Put yourself in the mind of a police sketch artist . Think . [ Young Jarod ] Well , it would help if I knew who he was . Is he your father ? No . Here . Along the middle of the right eyebrow , a spot . An imperfection . Yes . That 's it . But his eyes - Sydney , are you crying ? Of course not . Did that man hurt you ? [ Jarod On Phone ] Sydney 's in trouble , isn 't he ? [ Sighs ] How is it that you know everything that 's happening in this place ? Intuition . We saw your little drawing of Martin Zeller . - Who is he ? - I don 't know exactly . But I remember how Sydney was feeling when I ran that simulation . Who is he ? If Sydney wants to tell you , he will . Just find out where the Centre travel office has put Zeller up . - Sydney will be there . - How do I know this isn 't one of your boondoggles , Jarod ? If you care about Sydney at all , go alone . No Sweepers , no Cleaners . I just hope you get there in time . In time for what ? To stop him . [ Knocking ] [ German Accent ] I 'm starving . You should have been here 20 minutes ago . You 're late ! You 're right . I 'm very late . You don 't remember me . There were so many of us , you can 't remember the names . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 're a madman . You should hear every name . But your time has run out . [ Chuckles ] At my age , time means nothing . Maybe this still does . [ Gun Cocks ] Do it , if you will . Frankly , I 'm tired of hiding . No . That 's too easy . You will hear me out . Ja ? And then ? Then ... I will kill you . [ Thunder Rumbling ] Who won the fight ? - Man , go to hell . - I guess you were defending him . The father that you said you don 't care about . All-Conference three years in a row . He 's proud of you . - He told me . - When ? Just before he tried to kill himself ? - All he was thinking about was you and your mother . - Come on , man ! He thought by killing himself , he could stop the questions - that he would ease the pressure on both of you . I 'm not saying it 's right . It 's just what he was feeling . An insect made out of metal and wire ? - Fishing lure . - Oh . - Like bait . - Yeah . Dad makes them as a hobby . This is my lucky one . It got me a bite every time we went for trout . I saw a picture of you and your father fishing . It looks like fun . [ Chuckles ] You never went fishing with your dad ? I wasn 't lucky enough to know my father . You know yours . Take advantage of it . What is it ? Um ... the night before - before he was on that bench with you ... we had a really bad fight , and I said some stupid stuff . I told him that-that the accident was his fault . I told - What did you say ? I told him he didn 't deserve to live . I don 't want him to die . I don 't want my father to die . [ Door Opens , Closes ] - [ Honks Horn ] - Jarod . - I thought I 'd give you a hand . - Ah . I even brought you a cup of coffee . Ah ! Not so fast , M.I.T. Ah ! Not so fast , M.I.T. You 're not the only one with a chemistry degree . - Impressive . - [ Grunts ] Why is someone with your seniority and your chemistry background ... still doing a nasty job like transpo ? You could double your salary in research and development . Yeah , double my migraines . Here , pull over . I gotta check on this one . [ Whistling " Ninety-nine Bottles Of Beer On The Wall " ] Gotcha . Almost looks like an accident , doesn 't it ? - These are release papers . - Mm-hmm . - So what ? - You signed out 52 containers . - Yeah ? - Only 42 were buried in Nevada . Where 'd the other 10 go ? Horace Strickland had them delivered to drug dealers . Strickland had a felony drug-smuggling charge on his F.B.I. record . Heroin . My guess is he was smuggling them in the extra containers . Who would examine a container labeled " hazardous " ? Strickland 's bank account was getting pretty fat ... minus a few payments to Larry Meyers . Meyers was in on this ? He was extorting money out of Strickland ... threatening to blow the whistle on the operation . So on the day of the accident ... Strickland spiked the MZT shipment ... so that it would eat through Dan 's new seal ... and eat through Larry Meyers . [ Young Sydney ] It 's him . Who is he ? I received a package of my family 's belongings today , Jarod . It was lost for a very long time . This picture is of my brother Jacob and myself . Our first Communion . [ Young Jarod ] He 's your twin ? Jacob 's all the family I have . [ Young Jarod ] I wish I had a family . Jean Mikhail lived with his family ... on the little farm they built near Lyon . And his work only mattered to him in so far ... as it helped his wife , Greta , and his two sons . - [ Thunder Rumbling ] - Twin sons . Sydney . You do remember . Jakob was your brother . Very good , Herr Doktor . And he 's all the family I have left ... 'cause the rest you murdered ... because they were of no use to you . Who are you to pass judgment ? Who ? This is forJean Mikhail , and this is for Greta ! - [ Door Bursts Open ] - Sydney ! No ! Oh , my - - Who is Mr. Zeller ? - There is no Zeller . This is Dr. Krieg . Dr. Werner Krieg . The ambitious , young physician ... assigned to Dachau in 1944 . - The Nazis were testing us . - Oh , God . They were looking for ways ... to accelerate the reproduction of the master race . Jacob and I became Krieg 's favorite subjects . We were only children . He sent our whole family to the gas chambers ... so that he could have us for his experiments . Sydney , you 're notJewish . I 'm a twin , remember ? Strickland . A big shipment needs transport tonight . I 'm happy to help if you need me . Oh , I figured you 'd want to be alone . [ Whistling " Ninety-Nine Bottles Of Beer On The Wall " ] Geez , Jarod . You scared the wind out of me . Looks like we have one more item . That 's MZT . I don 't have any gear on . Neither did Larry Meyers . - Or the other two victims . Did they , Horace ? - That 's not funny . Neither is death by MZT . Is it ? Gotcha ! Jarod . ! I can 't move in here . I would relax if I were you . You 're going to be in there for the next , oh , 20,000 years . - Jarod , that 's MZT . - Mm-hmm . The deadliest pesticide in the world . Turns your insides into jelly . But it won 't corrode Dan Healy 's seal , will it ? Yes ! Yes ! It already did ! Of course , because you added ... this to it ... so you could get rid of your blackmailer , Larry Meyers ... and continue smuggling drugs . - I didn 't do anything . - You murdered three people . You framed Dan Healy . He was convinced that the only way that he could protect his family ... was to leave his wife without a husband and his son without a father . You destroyed his life , didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Didn 't you ? Yes ! Yes ! Now , don 't do this to me ! Why not ? You did it to them . Jarod ? Jarod ! Wait . ! Jarod . ! Jarod . ! Jarod ! - Jarod . ! - [ Whistling ] Jarod . ! [ Gasping ] Aah ! Jarod ! No ! [ Gasping , Panting ] Jarod . ! Whoo ! Twinkie cream . The food of the gods . Are you familiar with Nietzsche , Doctor ? Mm-hmm . Yes . You 're like the madman who runs into the marketplace ... screaming for God . But you 'll never find him , because God is dead . God is dead , and you killed him . We are both professionals , Doctor . I know who you work for . I know the work they do , the work you do . What do you think would have happened to you andJakob ... if I had not selected you ? Huh ? Would you be here now ... so full of purpose ? If God is dead , we all killed him . Sydney ? Do you remember the day ... my mother was buried ? I 'll never forget that day . You made me feel safe - safer than my own father - and all you did ... was hold my hand . Mmm . Give me your gun . He is a monster . Do yourself and the world a favor . I can 't . Why ? Jarod . Don 't you see ? I became the monster . The other day on the bench ... I realize now ... I did the wrong thing for all the wrong reasons . The important thing is you 're here now . Like someone once said : " Nothing 's more important than family . " - [ Chuckles ] - [ Door Opens ] Dad ? I love you . This will bring you luck too . Thank you . Thank you . Mmm . Take care , Twinkie man . [ Young Jarod ] I wish I had a family . What 's that , Sydney ? From the war . You were in a concentration camp ? My brother and I were kept in a cold and dark place ... for many years . Like the Centre ? Not exactly , Jarod . [ Young Jarod ] Did they hurt you ? Not as much as they hurt my family . They killed them all . I 'll be your family . I just got word , Syd . Dr. Krieg 's been extradited to Israel . This just arrived . Miss Parker ? Thank you . Syd ? How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb ? One . But the lightbulb has to want to change . - Are you all right ? - [ Sydney ] Yes , I am . All my life I have raged against him , Jarod . But when I saw him the last time ... I saw myself . You 're not a monster , Sydney . And you 're still ... my family . Tell me something . Have you ever been fishing ? Why ? Maybe we 'll go someday ... just you and me .

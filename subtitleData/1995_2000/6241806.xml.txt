 - Have you eaten anything ? - No . What is this , a picnic ? Let 's go ! We got 1 0 minutes to go ! - Punch me out . - You got it . Any word from the LAPD lntelligence ? If there is such a thing . Not yet , sir . Of course not . Because we 're a covert antiterrorism team that is so secret that when we snap our fingers nothin ' happens ! Sheriff 's department , airport police ... Still waiting , but Interpol insists he 's in Tripoli . Yeah , well , you trust that billion-dollar satellite ! I 'll trust a $ 1 0 snitch at this point . - Sean , look ... - What ? Why don 't you give ' em a little break , okay ? We 'll take a break when the case breaks , okay ? You know , I never really enjoyed the Messiah . In fact , I think it 's fucking boring . But your voice makes even a hack like Handel seem like a genius . Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! Victor , when we ... When we put this thing to bed , you can brand the Fourth Amendment on my butt ! Thank you . Sir , excuse me . Your wife is on line one . Sean ! A jet was just charted . Anderson Airfield . Guess who paid the bill in cash . Pollux Troy ! - Put one of our people on that plane . - Wait , we still got no sign of Castor ! Pollux doesn 't fly without big brother ! Now , come on ! You 're 26 minutes late . The casing didn 't fit , right ? See , I told you goddamn Dietrich would try to pawn off some cheap shit North Korean plastic . Casing fit like a condom . You didn 't deviate from the plan , did you , Pollux ? How long you want me to sit here twiddling my thumbs ? I paid for the jet ... Save us some time . That 's what the boys are for , to hide our famous faces . If I didn 't love you so damn much , I 'd have to kill you , Bro . I hate it when you call me , " Bro . " You guys are paid to protect him from everybody , including himself . And stay away from downtown on the 1 8th , it 's gonna be a little smoggy . Okay , my passengers are here . I gotta go . Let 's go . Let 's go. I 'm bored . Let 's go . - Here you go . - Bravo . Would you like anything else once we 're airborne ? Oh , a peach . Sit . Come here . You know , I can eat a peach for hours . Come here . If I were to send you flowers , where would I ... No , wait . Let me rephrase . If I were to let you suck my tongue , would you be grateful ? There 's someone on the runway . Get off of me ! Archer ! fbi ! This is a very big gun . Fly the fucking plane . Come on . That 's it . Come on , let 's go ! Damn it ! Don 't play chicken with a goddamn jet ! Come on ! He 's got Winters ! God damn it ! Damn it , Sean ! All units , pin ' em in ! Close in on ' em ! One of yours , Sean ? Shit ! Out ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Go ! God damn it , Sean ! Take off now ! - Fly ! - l can 't ! Fly , bitch ! All units , locked and ready ! Follow Archer 's lead ! What the fuck are you doing ? There 's an engine out . We gotta stop . Move it , move it , move it ! Pollux ! Cas ! Secure the hangar ! Berkley , down ! Down ! Give up , Castor ! Your time 's up ! Well , you better hit me , Sean , 'cause you only got one bullet left . So do you . Wow ! We 've got somethin ' in common ! We both know our guns . What we don 't have in common is that I don 't care if I live , and you do . Sean , that hurts . You 're not havin ' any fun , are you , Sean ? Why don 't you come with us ? Try terrorism for hire . We 'll blow some shit up. lt 's more fun ! - Shut the fuck up . - You watch your fucking mouth ! I 'm about to unleash the biblical plague " Hell-A " deserves . But I 'll give this shithole a break if my brother and I walk . - Bullshit . - Oh , no , I see , you think I 'm bluffing . Maybe I am . But then , maybe I 'm not . More importantly , what would you do with me locked up ? You 'd drive your wife and kid crazy . Say , how is your daughter anyway ? is she ripening by now ? Your darling Janie , your little peach , is she ripe ? I 'm ready ! Okay . Please , man , don 't shoot me . I 'm scared , Seany . Well , I think you better pull the trigger . Because I don 't give a fuck . I 'm ready Ready for the big ride , baby Well , Sean , looks like Elvis done left the building . It wasn 't my fault ! Why won 't you ever be on my side ? I am always on your side , but you have to give me a chance . Now what ? She was suspended again . Some kid made a crack about her clothes . She started a fight . That 's right , Dad . Don 't even ask me what happened . Okay , what happened ? I see . Not like you would believe me anyway . Jamie , look , it 's not easy , okay . I mean ... You change the way you look every week . And the way you act ... Who are you supposed to be now ? I 'm supposed to be me . Not like you have a clue who I am anyway ! I have to work tonight . I called to tell you , but I was on hold for 1 0 minutes , and I couldn 't wait any longer . I got him , Eve . It 's over . Oh , Sean ! I 'll make it up to you and Jamie , I promise . I 'll put in for a desk job , I 'll do counseling , sit down , talk about Mike , I 'll do it . Anything you want . I just want you . Well , good , 'cause that 's what you 're gonna get . You happy ? Yes . Yeah ! Oh , thank God ! Hold on . What is all this ? Sir , the ClA sent this over . I didn 't know they catered . Send it back . No , wait . How about ... What about to Anderson , Montgomery , Berkley , Pincus , Gianelli , Winters . How 's Loomis ? He 's gonna need a little surgery , but ... He 'll be okay . - What 's up ? - Special Ops . They want a word . Forget it. I don 't have the time . Better make time , Sean . Recovered from the jet wreckage . Found in Pollux Troy 's briefcase . Porcelain casing , thermal cloak , nerve gas and biological payload . It 's enough to flatten a square mile , and then , depending on the prevailing winds , the fallout will be a tad worse than Gulf War Syndrome . A biblical ... A biblical plague that L.A ... Where is he ? Where is Pollux Troy ? Why draw the schematic if you 're not gonna build the bomb ? Is it a crime in this country to exercise the mind ? I 'm interested in ... I won 't say another word until I see my brother . Any progress ? I need about 1 0 minutes alone with this guy . Give it a rest . You got Castor . Just go home . Look , we 're not gonna evacuate the city on your hunch ! I know Castor too well for this to be a hunch ! You know what ? Just run the goddamn Bureau any way you like ! I could put an agent in his cell . Maybe Pollux will let it slip . Oh , come on . He 's a paranoid sociopath . The only person he 'd talk to about that bomb is his brother , and he 's dead . There is one other possibility . Oh , God ! You 're keeping him alive ! Relax , Archer . He 's a turnip . What if you could walk into Erewhon prison and give Pollux a nice , big-brotherly hug as Castor Troy ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . Let me try . Malcolm Walsh . - l run the biocover unit for special ops . - l know who you are . But you don 't know what I can do . Physical alteration , augmentation ... Dr. Walsh can alter the likeness , even the voice , of a government witness . I think you 'll recognize this patient . We had to build your friend Loomis a whole new ear from scratch . What we 're suggesting for you , Archer , isn 't a permanent transplant like that , just a temporary trade . Come here . With the new anti-inflammatories , healing takes days , not weeks . Your blood types won 't match , but Pollux won 't know that . Height difference is negligible . Skin pigment , eye pigment , both almost identical . We 'll use laser shears for the hairline , microplugs for body hair . We 'll do an abdominoplasty , take care of those love handles . But all that 's the easy part . Here 's the real science . This is a state-of-the-art morphogenetic template . The inside is modeled on your skull , the outside exactly like Troy 's . Then we fit his face on top . Not a replica , but the real thing . Then we simply connect the muscles , tear ducts and nerve endings . So , you want to take his face and mine ... Borrow ! The procedure 's completely reversible . You think that I want to do this ? No . No ! - There 's no one else ! - No ! You have lived and breathed Castor Troy for years . I 'll get his gang to talk . That 's what I do ! What if you can 't ? The bomb will blow , and Castor Troy will win . Get out ! Go ahead ! And wipe your ass . Damn ! What the hell is that smell ? - He shit in his pants . - Where 's Dietrich ? Hello , Sasha . When was the last time you saw Castor Troy ? - Who cares ? He 's dead . - Answer the question . I know my rights . I don 't have to answer shit . You 're right , but know this . You 're a convicted felon on probation for harboring Castor Troy . One phone call from me and your son will end up in a foster home . I understand why you would use such a threat . But you try to take him away from me , I swear to you ... I haven 't seen him for years . This reeks of you . It 's got your signature all over it . Maybe . But you ain 't got nothin ' on me , and you know it . Maybe so , but I can keep you within city limits , or I can talk to your sister again . She 's right outside . Only this time , I 'll be nice . Hey , Sean , how 's your dead son ? I don 't know ... Okay , okay , I heard somethin ' about the 1 8th ! But that 's all I know . Great . So we got a date , but where the hell 's the damn bomb ? Only Pollux Troy will know that . It 's your call , Sean . Does Lazarro know your plan ? No , this is a black-bag operation , strictly off the books . You can 't tell Lazarro , and you can 't tell your wife . Oh , God . What are you asking me to do ? Okay , let 's see ... You 're asking me to break the law , risk my neck ... And you 're asking me to put in the dark all the people that love me and trust me . I 'll do it . Sean . I 'm sorry I woke you . Oh , I 'm glad it 's you that woke me and not a phone call telling me you won 't be coming home . But that 's a fear I can finally let go of , huh ? Oh , it 's all right , Sean. it 's okay . I keep ... I keep wanting to move this over here , you know ? If it had only been an inch to the left , Mikey would be alive . And you wouldn 't be . Sean , things are gonna get better now that you 're home . The scar won 't move , but it will heal if you let it . Everything will be better now that this is forever out of our lives . Eve , if I told you that I realized that this thing won 't fully end until I did one last thing ... Eve , something vital . You 're going back on assignment again . Just one last time . Come on , Eve . " l 'm not going anywhere , " that 's what you told me . You don 't need me to tell you what to do , Sean . You never have , so go . But go now . Sean , I 'm changin ' my mind . This is a suicide mission . Yeah , I know. I know . But maybe this doctor ... If he ... lf he can do even half of what he says he can do , maybe it 'll work. I don 't know . I 'd become Castor Troy , be in control . That 's the part that scares me . Doctor , I have something ... I have this scar that ... That ... lf you can put this back after all this is over ... lt 's important to me. lt 's like a reminder . Sure . Tito , please hold this for me . Please . Okay , let 's go . Oh , God . Oh , my God . Sean . Hey , you okay ? Come on , talk to me , Sean . Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Sean ! Sean ! Sean ! Come on , sit down ! Sean ! Sean ! Archer ! You 're Sean Archer ! You 're Sean Archer ! Sean Archer . When this is over , I want you to take this face and burn it . Hey ... I still sound like me . I 've implanted a microchip on your larynx . It 's fantastic , but you 'll have to be careful . Pressure , a sharp blow , even a violent sneeze could dislodge it . Just repeat what you hear . Peach ... I can eat a peach for hours . Peach ... I can eat a peach for hours . There 's a scratchy tickle . Peach ... I can eat a peach for hours . Peach ... I can eat a peach for hours . Once again . Peach ... I can eat a peach for hours . Perfect . Now , Sean , six days until the 1 8th , the clock 's ticking , and so is the bomb . You 've got two days to get Pollux to talk . Either way , Miller comes in , pulls you out . You got me ? - What 's the matter ? - Face itches . You all right ? Come on , let 's go . Archer 's gonna be pissed when he comes back from his training op and finds out . The guy 's knee-deep in Georgia swamp . You are now the property of Erewhon prison . A citizen of nowhere . The Geneva Convention is void here . Amnesty International doesn 't know we exist . When I say your ass belongs to me , I mean exactly that . This entire prison 's one big magnetic field . The boots tell us where you are . 6-21 to population ! What 's the matter , pal ? Don 't you remember the little people ? - Burke Hicks . - Oh , yeah . I bust ... Believe Sean Archer busted you for stalking the UN Secretary General . No , Archer framed me ! I ain 't had nothin ' to do with that . Word was you got wasted . You want to see what " wasted " looks like , little man ? Pollux . Yeah ! Out of the way ! Central , there 's a disturbance in the population . - Go to lockdown . - Hold that lockdown . Come on , you pussy ! Watch your fucking mouth . Watch your fucking mouth ! 'Cause I 'm Castor Troy ! Yeah ! I 'm Castor Troy ! Yeah ! Lock ' em down ! I stop the fights , not you . That 's two strikes for you , Dubov . One more , you know where you 're goin ' . - When I get out of here ... - lf you get out of here . ... I 'm gonna have you fired . Lars ? It 's me . Believe it ! Someone ... They took ... Switched my ... Some fucking ... But it 's cool . We 're gonna deal with it . Oh , yes ! We 're gonna deal with it ! - What 's this about ? - Dr . Walsh ! I was just sittin ' here , enjoying ' some of your greatest hits here . Oh , I hope you don 't mind . I partook of your groovy ... Your groovy painkillers . This is fabulous work . This is ... Oh ! Bravo ! Bra-fucking-vo ! Oh , God , this is excellent ! Bravo ! What do you want ? Take one goddamn guess ! Wish they 'd play some of those salmon-spawning scenes again . I found them intensely erotic . Fucking nature channel . One more waterfall , I 'm gonna foam at the mouth . It 's like they 're begging us to riot . Excuse me . Not feeling very coordinated lately , are you ? Look , Bro , you gotta help me . I am so fried . If the psychos in here find out I 'm misfiring , we 're both gonna be dead meat . Shock treatment ? What 's the matter with you , did they operate ? I was in a coma . Jesus , you 're still so fucking paranoid ! Aren 't they giving you your medication in here ? What was my medication ? Pollux , I hand-fed you those pills for years . Vivex. I haven 't forgotten that . It 's just everything else . It 's senses , my reflexes ... My memory . It 's like a tab of bad Quantrex . I don 't even know why that fucking yeti jumped me yesterday . Dubov ? You had a sex sandwich with his wife and his sister the night he was sent here . I guess that explains why he 's so upset . Wow . We 're gonna blow up L.A. , Bro . Ain 't it cool ? All right , rub my nose in it , why don 't you ? $ 1 0 million design , and now those militia nutjobs get to keep their cash ? It 's so fucking unfair . That bomb you built does deserve an audience . It 's a work of art . It belongs in the Louvre . Yes , it does . Oh , well . I guess the L.A. Convention Center will have to do . - What ? - Thank you . For what ? You are so fucking pathetic . You got a visitor . You 're good lookin ' ! You 're hot ! It 's like looking in a mirror , only not . - Troy ? - Now , that is between us . Okay ? But you were ... ln a coma ? Nothing like having your face cut off to disturb your sleep . Read the newspaper lately ? You killed them ? Well , look ... Beats paying ' the bill , huh ? Come on , if a face-lift costs 5 grand ... See anything you like ? Tito . I torched all the evidence that proves you 're you , okay ? So , wow ! Looks like you 're gonna be in here for the next 1 00 years ! Now , I have got to go . I 've got a government job to abuse and a lonely wife to fuck . Did I say that ? I 'm sorry . Make love to . Oh , God ! I miss that face . Die ! I 'm sorry , Agent Archer . No , don 't you worry about it , Mr. Walton . Clearly , he 's had a traumatic childhood and ... Thank you . Look at this place . I 'm in hell . I may never get a hard-on again . Oh . Yes . There we go . Well , I suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived . Come on , give me a break . Every house on this block looks the same . Then I spotted you ... Eve ... My one and only Eve . So , how was your vital assignment ? Which one was that ? How should I know , Sean ? Oh , oh , oh , oh , yes ... The out-of-body experience . Yes , that one . - Where you goin ' ? - To the hospital . No . No ! What 's the matter ? Sean , come on . Quit teasing me . Stop it . I 'm still really hurt , okay ? There are leftovers in the fridge . No , no , I want to stay hungry for you ... My peach . Give me that tongue . Sean , come on . I can 't believe what you 're doing . Eve ... I hate to see you go , but I love to watch you leave . " Date night fizzled again . " We haven 't made love in two months . " What a loser . Got your e-mail , Karl . The poem you sent me was pretty kinky . The plot thickens . Hang on a second . I 'll have to call you back . You 're not respecting my boundaries . - l 'm coming in , Janie . - Janie ? I don 't think you heard me , Jamie . You got something that I crave . Clarissa left those here . I won 't tell Mom if you don 't . When did you start smoking ? You 'll be seeing a lot of changes around here . " Papa 's got a brand-new bag . " Bye , Bro . Drop me a line sometime . Gonna be kind of lonely with Pollux gone , huh ? Pollux what ? That big-shit cop , Archer , cut him a deal for turning states ' evidence . Your brother 's been released . I 'm Sean Archer . There is a bomb at the L.A. Convention Center ! I 'm Sean Archer , and ... Tiramisu Sir , we just wanted you to know ... We 're all really sorry about Tito . Oh , hey , shit happens , you know ? So , is our star witness talking ? Yeah . About what kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches . If that bomb is out there , we 're almost out of time . Archer ! You made the deal with Pollux Troy . That isn 't like you . Well ... When all else fails , fresh tactics . Fresh ? Well , let me tell you my fresh tactic . From now on , everything to do with this case goes through me . Understood ? Good ! Thanks . You 're supposed to be snitching and making me look good . Look good ? Seeing that face on you makes me afraid my tiramisu might come back up . Well , think about me , this nose , this hair , this ridiculous chin . Brother ... We 're going straight . Oh , my goodness . You exchanged brains as well ? The first thing I need you to confess to is the location of the bomb . What about our $ 1 0 million ? What about when I become an American hero for defusing the bomb ? What 's that worth ? Know that . Thank you . Next question . You 're not the only one in the family with brains . No . Although now , I am the only one with the looks . Touché . This is an emergency evacuation . Go , quickly ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Out of the way ! - Any ideas ? - Yeah , run . Sir , it 's protected by a tamper switch , and it 'll take us hours to bypass . - Evacuate your team , Captain . - But , sir , we can 't disarm ... Leave ! Hallelujah Hallelujah , Hallelujah Hallelujah Oh , baby ... That was the scene at the L.A. Convention Center , where an FBI agent became a city savior . Sean Archer disarmed a massive bomb just one second before it was set to blow . The apparent targets were three supreme-court justices , scheduled to speak here today , and anyone unlucky enough to be within a mile of the scene . We asked Agent Archer if the FBI had any leads on who planted the device . Well , that is classified information . But if he 's listening , I wouldn 't mind giving him a message . Interception . Now our side 's got the ball . Sorry . Wanda ... Everybody , hey , look , I ... I want to thank you for enduring all these years that I was an insufferable bore . Sir , did you just have a surgical procedure ? What do you mean ? Well , was the stick successfully removed from your ass ? The White House on one . It 's the President . Oh , and your wife on line two . - Well , you tell the President to hold . - Okay . My God ! - Sean , you scared the hell out of me . - lt 's date night . - Congratulations . - Oh , big deal . Okay , I said , " Mr. President , I want the authority " and I want the funds and the personnel " to take over the whole gamut of global terrorism , " right ? And he said , " The next name on my calling list is Lazarro , " and I 'm telling him " that Sean Archer writes his own ticket , " okay ? What 's the matter ? I don 't know , Sean . You just ... You just seem so different . I mean , what is all this about , this intimate candlelight dinner ? I 'm supposed to forget all the promises 'cause you 're going back into the fray ? If the top cop in this country can 't come home every night to his wife , then the hell with the country . Because the only place I 'm going is upstairs with you . Exercise , one hour . How can I get out of here ? You can 't . How can I get these boots off ? They only take them off in the clinic , right before they fry your skull . Hey ! - l 'm out of cigarettes . - Get back in line , Troy . I said I 'm out of cigarettes . Kick his ass ! Hey , what the hell ? That 's not right ! I need a light ! I need a light ! Anybody got a light ? Anybody got a light ? Got a light ? You better bring the bastard down before he chokes himself to death . Well ! Happy day ! It 's Castor Troy . Wait , hold it , hold it . Can I have a light ? You know those things will kill you . Get his boots , Walton . Dubov , I didn 't touch your wife . And I didn 't touch your sister . But I know your wife loves you . She 's waiting for you . So let 's get out of here . You 're more brain-dead than Dubov . Out . Open the door ! I got him ! There 's fire . We have a man down in C-4 . I got ' em ! Move it , now ! Move ! Get down ! Dubov ! No ! Get out . Dubov ! Give me your hand . Come on ! You can do it ! No ! Sean ! Wait ! - What are you doing ? - Oh ! I 'm sorry . Have a nice day . " Have a nice day " ? What is with you ? is this your way ofjust not dealing with this morning ? Yeah . Yeah , maybe . Sean ! Sean ! I know it 's hard for you , but it 's hard for me , too , and we still have to go . Happy birthday , Mikey . He took our baby , Sean . He took our little boy . - You turned your beeper off . - Yes , well , my son 's birthday . Well , here 's some poetic justice , sir , Castor Troy is dead . He got killed , trying to escape from Erewhon . Where 's his body ? I want to see his body . - lt hasn 't been recovered yet . - lt hasn 't been recovered yet ? Get the LAPD on this ! Even if he is alive , Castor isn 't stupid enough to come back to the city . You must ... You must trust me . He 's already here . County General . How may I direct your call ? Dr. Archer , please. lt 's an emergency . May I say who 's calling ? Her husband . Dr. Archer ? Call on line three . I know this sounds crazy , but ... - Sean ? - Eve , listen carefully , the man you think is your husband isn 't . - Who is this ? - Just listen . Take Jamie , go to your mother 's . Don 't tell him where you 're going . Just go . Whoever you are , don 't call again . Operations . I need Victor Lazarro immediately . Regarding ? I have information about Castor Troy . I 'll transfer you , sir . Sean Archer here . Who 's calling ? Well , if you 're Sean Archer , I guess I 'm Castor Troy . Yes . This escaped convict is considered extremely dangerous . If you have any information concerning the whereabouts of Castor Troy ... You goddamn right ! Yeah ! This shit 's so good , it 's gonna make your dick hard . What ? Cheryl ? Cheryl 's a liar ! Dietrich ... So , you 're still selling drugs to Cheryl and Phil Roy . Castor Fucking Troy ! Oh , man ! You scared me , man ! All right ! All right ! I never should have sold you those bombs . It 's my curse. I can 't say no to a friend . - You can 't say no to money . - That 's my other curse . - You drug dealer ! - What 's the matter ? What ? You look like you just fucked your mother . Come on , let 's go relax , huh ? Hey ! Hey , Castor . I don 't believe this ! Castor Troy ! How you been ? Hey , baby ! Remember me ? I 'm your favorite peach . I thought I was your favorite . Look at this guy . You know , you look pretty good for a dead guy . Hey ! - Let 's go . - Two ? Yeah . So , what do you want to do ? - You want to get out of the country ? - l 'm not going anywhere . I 'm gonna get Sean Archer with your help . Okay . Welcome home , baby . How are we supposed to do that ? He 's vulnerable at home . No. I mean , this is Sean Archer we 're talkin ' about . This isn 't just some Boy Scout . Fitch ... Besides , his house is probably alarmed up the wazoo . The code is 1 0-1 9-86 . That 's his dead son 's birthday . Don 't it just break your heart ? That 's brilliant . But sick . How is it that you know so much about Sean Archer ? I sleep with his wife . What ? Jesus Christ , this is great . So , once we kidnap supercop , then what ? Tiny surgery . I 'd like to take his face off . Yeah . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to use the little boys ' wee-wee room . Cas ... You want to take his face ... Yes . His face off ! The eyes , nose , skin , it 's comin ' off . The face ... Off . No more drugs for that man . I 'm not me . I 'm me . Not me . Me . Castor . Archer . Castor . Archer . - l thought you were dead . - l 'm not dead . I 'm me . No , no , look , what I 'm trying to tell you , Brother , Pollux , is once we get the full protection and resources of the government to help us get rid of our rivals , right , then we 'll be set . Then maybe , just maybe , I 'll get my frickin ' face back . Then I 'll just have one jagoff to take care of . Hey , where you goin ' ? Where you goin ' ? Karl , stop it . Maybe two . Hang on . - Karl , stop it ! Karl ! - Calm down ! Karl , my dad 's gonna ... Karl ! Happy hunting. I 'll catch you later . Yeah , like Mr. fucking invisible gives a shit about you , anyways . So fucking hold still . - Karl ! - Calm down ! - Say you 're sorry . - l 'm sorry ! - l didn 't hear it . - l 'm sorry ! - Mean it . - l 'm so sorry ! Dress up like Halloween , and ghouls will try to get in your pants . Typical , Dad . Some guy tries to rape me , and I 'm to blame . This isn 't you . You haven 't been the same since Mike died , hiding behind someone else 's face , hoping you wouldn 't feel the pain . While we 're talking , do you have protection ? What , you mean , like , condoms ? Protection . Next time , let Karl take his pants down . Slip this in his thigh , twist it , so the wound won 't close . Now , go on . Get out of here . I am the king . Eve ... Jesus , Cas ! It 's me ! It 's me . Cas . Come on. lt 's me . Jesus ! Come on . Don 't you want to talk ? The only talk I 've ever heard from you is , " Suck my tongue , " " love your ass , " and " see ya . " Take this filthy shit off , put this on , and get out of here ! No , I 'm not going anywhere . Oh , really ? What do you expect me , after all this time , just to jump on you ? - That 's not ... - ls that what you expect ? - That 's not what I meant . - What did you mean , huh ? is this what you meant ? That ? How about this ? is that good ? Huh ? Sean Archer . Bro , I figured he might drop in on some of our old friends . And if my eyes don 't deceive , I think this fellow 's beginning to enjoy being you . Good . Look , look , okay , look , Sasha . What I meant is that I 'm not going anywhere until your brother helps me first . Cas , if the fbi finds out that you 're here , I 'll lose my son . Please , Cas , you just gotta go . I 've said and done some things that made your life harder . - l know . - How would you ? - When you left , you never looked back . - l just know . Look , Sasha , I 'm not the same person you remember . And for what it 's worth , I 'm sorry . - These are nice-looking clothes . - Yeah , of course . They 're yours . I know , I ... Just like them . That 's a nice-looking kid , too . Yeah . Of course . He 's yours , too . Move ! Move ! - How old is he ? - Five . Nobody knows he 's yours . I was scared someone would hurt him just to hurt you . Adam ! Adam ! I don 't want you playing with those things . They are very , very dangerous , okay ? Now , come on , sweetie . I want you to meet your father . Look at him. lt 's okay . Say , " Hi . " Hi . Michael ! Michael ! Michael ? Cas . Cas . - Michael ? - Cas , you 're scaring him . Let him go . What is the matter with you ? Get down ! Okay , Red Team ! Red Team , break off ! How 'd you get to be so brave ? How 'd you get to be so brave ? Come out now with your hands up ! Put these on . That 's a good idea , baby . Listen to your music . Come on . Go ! Go ! We have a warrant for your arrest ! Cops . I hate cops . Come on , kid . Move ! Move ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Move more to the right ! Go ! Go ! Let 's get out of here ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Damn ! My place is getting fucked up . Take him . Cas ! Cas ! Give me the boy ! Really ? Really ? Come on ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Cas , be careful with him ! Don 't be scared . All right ? All right ? Adam ! Get him out back ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Put the boy down . Honey , don 't touch that . It isn 't nice ! I don 't ever want to see you do that . They 're like cockroaches ! Hey ! Drop it . That 's it . Buzz . Hey ! Told him not to fuck with me . Take the boy and get out of here . - Are you all right ? - Go ! Hurry up . Hey , man . We had some good times , didn 't we ? I don 't know what I hate wearing worse , your face or your body . I mean , I enjoy boning your wife . Now , let 's face it , we both like it better the other way , yes ? So why don 't we just trade back ? You can 't give back what you 've taken from me . Oh , well ... Plan " B. " Let 's just kill each other . Sir , why are you so upset ? It 's just Pollux Troy . Sir , look . You 're on the cover of Time . Listen , " ln a single week , Agent Sean Archer " has ordered a stunning series of blitzkrieg-style raids " on the hideouts , staging grounds , and safe houses " of our nation 's assassins , car bomb ... " Sean , look , we 're friends , so I 'm gonna tell you face to face . I don 't give a damn if you are Time 's Man of the Year . After last night 's blood bath , I am terminating your war on terrorists . is that because I 'm getting all the kudos and you 're not ? I don 't know where you 're getting your intelligence . It 's not from field agents . Sometimes I think you know too much . Washington 's starting to worry . Justice wants a hearing . They 're concerned about the constitutionality of your gestapo tactics , and frankly , so am I ! Okay , Victor , I 'll give the taxpayers a break . But ... I have something I want to confess , and I don 't think you 're gonna like it . I am Castor Troy . - Kimmy . Kim ? - Yes , sir ? Call the paramedics . Victor Lazarro has had a heart attack . - Oh , God , right away . - Thank you . Eighty-one . Home . Eve . No , honey , please . Please don 't scream . Don 't scream. I 'm not gonna hurt you . Just don 't ... Don 't ... Just don 't look at my face . And the voice , don 't ... Listen . I know who you are ! You killed our son ! I did not kill our son . I 'm Sean ! No ! No ! The last time I saw you was in this room . We had a fight when I said I had to go away again . I spent the night in Mike 's old bed . I 'm tired , Eve . The assignment was to enter a federal prison as Castor Troy . It 's just fucking insane . And a Special-Ops surgeon gave me Castor 's face ! Then ... And then , somehow , Castor came out of his ... His coma and killed everybody who knew about the mission , but not before transforming into me . I know you don 't believe a word I 'm saying . Well , here 's proof , Doctor . Your husband ... Me ... My ... Sean 's blood type is O-negative . Castor 's is AB . And I love you . Get some backup . What a day . You look tense . I know I 've been acting different lately , strange , but I 've got a confession to make , Eve . You 're not gonna like it . Oh , Eve , I feel ... I feel so close to you . I read your diary . I know I shouldn 't have. I 'm ashamed . But I did . I just want to be the man that you deserve , passionate , tender . Victor Lazarro died today . He had a heart seizure . My mentor , gone . First Tito , then Victor . So what ? I hope this doesn 't mean I 'm losing you . Of course not . You 're the only family I 've got . Oh , God . I was hoping you 'd come here . Thank you for trusting me . Right now , I don 't trust anyone . Eve , where 'd you get that gun ? I took it from my fake husband . Put it down . - You know I 'm Sean . - Do I ? Maybe Sean 's already dead , huh ? I 'm moving very slowly . I was thinking the other day ... I remember I once took a date out for surf and turf , not knowing she was a vegetarian . So she ate bread , and broke her tooth on a rye seed . We drove around all night looking for a all-night dentist . And he was so drunk , he fixed the wrong tooth . And when I finally brought her home ... Even though it must have hurt like hell , you kissed me . Sean ... That man ... You know we 've been living together as man and wife for a week . I know . Eve . I put you in that position , and I can never make it up to you . Well , you 're damn well gonna try . Let me take a look at that wound before you bleed to death . With Lazarro out of the way , Castor 's the new acting director of the Bureau . - He 's untouchable . - Not tomorrow . Tomorrow he 'll be at Victor 's service . Tomorrow . That will be the day . I want you and Jamie away from there . Give him a good excuse . I can cover for Jamie , but if I 'm not coming , he 's gonna know something 's up . And besides , I 'm the only one who can try and explain the truth . Excuse me , Mr. Archer , may I help you ? Dr. Levine to X-ray . Sean , what are you doing here ? I 'm so sorry , darling . I just get so jealous . I mean , what is a guy to think when his wife runs off in the middle of the night ? That I 'm a doctor that 's on call , so please let me get back to work , okay ? Sorry . Lies , distrust , mixed messages , this is turning into a real marriage . How 's Adam ? I took him over to my cousin 's until this whole thing blows over . - Where 's Jamie ? - That 's what I 'd like to know . She stole $ 50 from my purse and took off . - So , what 's the next move ? - This isn 't your fight . Well , come on , you 're surprised ? Our daughter won 't even visit Michael 's grave . You think she gives a damn about your boss ? He killed my brother . I 'm not gonna let him take you , too . Whatever happens , I promise Sean Archer is off your back for good . My dear friends , we are here to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro . Amen . Somebody back there asked me to give this to you . In peace now , let us take our brother Victor to his place of rest . Isn 't this religious ? Yes . The eternal battle between good and evil , saint and sinner . But you 're still not having any fun ! Honey ? Honey . Come here . And guess what ? Your daughter 's on the way . History repeats itself . This is between us . - Leave them out of it . - No , you should have left them out of it . Your son was an accident . I wanted to kill you . But you took it so personally . Why didn 't you just kill yourself or let it go ? No father could . - No brother could , either . - Neither could a sister . Hey , baby . Sasha , what the fuck are you doing here ? Gee , Archer , I guess I 'm crashing . - You okay , baby ? - Yeah , thanks . Sasha , Baby , I 'm Castor . That 's Archer . And I 'm bored . Put the fucking gun down . Why don 't you put your guns down ? What a predicament ! Take care of our boy . I love him so much . Don 't let him grow up to be like us . Promise ? - Yeah . - See ya . Mom ? Jamie ! Jamie , don 't ! Hello , Wanda ? Wanda , this is Eve Archer . I have something crazy to tell you . It 's a capital crime to try to kill the next big boss of the fbi , yes ? Yes ! - Yes ! - The penalty ... What ? The penalty is death ! Die . Please , God , die . Hold it ! Good girl , Jamie ! Shoot him ! Honey , don 't listen to him . He 's not your father ! Hear my voice ! I 'm your father ! Use your eyes , Jamie ! Shoot him ! Don 't listen to him ! Don 't shoot ! This scumbag ... This scumbag shot your brother , Jamie ! Kill him ! Clod ! No daughter of mine would shoot so wide . Dad , put the gun down . Put it down . Dad , put it down . Now we 're gonna find out what 's in Papa 's bag . Peaches . Say goodbye to Papa ! Jamie ! Jamie , are you all right ? Oh , God ! Sir , are you okay ? Will someone please tell me what planet I 'm on ? Get down ! Stop ! This is the police ! Stop immediately or we will be forced to open fire ! Fire ! Fire ! You 're right , Sean. I 've misbehaved . I need to be punished . But remember , every time you look in the mirror , you 'll see my face . Die ! Ready Ready for the big ride , baby You okay , Archer ? What did you call me ? He called you Archer , sir . Sean . They 're bringing in their top surgical team from DC . You 're gonna be okay . When you wake up , everything will be restored just the way it was . My scar ... The one near my heart ? This old bullet wound , I won 't need it anymore . Okay . Dad ? I 'm sorry I shot you . I 've got something I have to ask both of you . This is Adam , and he needs a place to live . Hi . My name 's Jamie . I 'm Adam . Why don 't you show Adam his new room ? Come on ! Okay .

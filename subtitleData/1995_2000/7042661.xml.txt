 Gemini , this is Houston . Do you copy ? Roger that , Houston . This is Captain Fred Randall . Houston , the earth looks beautiful . It 's like a giant blueberry . Roger that , Houston . We are set to fire retrorockets . That 's a go , Gemini . Retrofire ignition In T-minus six and counting . Five , four , three , two , one , ignition ! Houston , we have a problem ! We have a problem ! Mission control . The gyro is out ! The gyro is out ! Houston , we have a problem ! We have a problem ! I want my mommy ! I want my mommy ! Uh-oh . Fred Z. Randall , what are you doing ? I come in peace . Look , George . It 's our little moon man . Wh ... Sweet pickled pineapples . Why can 't he just play football like the rest of the kids ? Tsk . George . Houston , request go for landing . Pilgrim One requests go for landing . Go is affirmative . Pilgrim One , you are go for landing . Roger that , Houston . Aeroshell deployed . Acceleration rate , normal . Eclis is go . Pilgrim is through the high gate at 80 % . Heartbeat , steady . The man is made of ice . Bill . I see it . Houston , request 20 % X-gimbal correction . Tell them no . Negative . Pilgrim , hold your transfer ellipse steady . What 's going on , Hackman ? This isn 't right . Computer says we 're comin ' in too steep . Twenty thousand meters . Pilgrim dropping rapidly to the Martian surface . Flight slope is eroding . APUs are go . Gary ? Increase 20 % . Do it now , or we 'll burn up . Going in . Why is he course correcting ? Why is he course correcting ? Can someone answer me , Please ? I don 't know . Engaging landing thrusters . Houston , we 're off course . Come on . We 're losin ' her . We 're losin ' her , man . We 're losin ' her . Houston . Why ? Congratulations . You 're all dead . Oh . Third time in a row , Hackman . Nice move on that course correction . Paul , it wasn 't his fault . That 's right . The navigation computer keeps telling me to correct . It 's obviously screwed up . Oh , that 's the problem ? Pardon me . Gary says the computer is screwing up , then the computer is screwing up . Now why don 't you just fix it ? Get me the name of the guy that wrote this software ! Better engage the antitheft device . Hey , morning , everybody ! Hi , Floyd ! Hey , Kimmie Lee Wong ! Five minutes till the official workday starts . That 's five minutes to save the world . Die ! Get back to your own planet , you big , bulgy eyed , bald creature . Your supervisor showed us in . He said that you 're the man who designed our mission operating system ? Sweet Alaskan asparagus tips . You 're the Mars team . Well , Mr. Randall , uh ... Paul Wick . Lead flight director . Oh , sir , I am a big fan of yours . It 's a ... William Overbeck . " Wild Bill " Overbeck . Oh ! In my office . I feel like a paleontologist that 's been huntin ' dinosaurs his whole life and finally got to meet one . Thank you . Eight shuttle missions ! Eight of ' em ! It was nine actually , but who 's counting ? Well , apparently you are , my friend . Oh , thank you for bringin ' him here . I 've been following his career since I used ... Bill , check this out . ... to play in the flop cycle , swirling and twirling and ... Gary Hackman ? Computer specialist . How 's my baby treating ' ya ? Actually , uh ... That 's why we 're here . Some of us think it may have a glitch . A glitch ? No , that 's not possible . I programed it myself . It 's perfect . Not exactly . Your program keeps miscalculating our orbital entry trajectories . Here 's the data . Oh , oh , okay . Yup . Okay . Here we go . Here we go . Here it comes . Mmm-hmm . Mmm-hmm . Mmm-hmm . Mmm ... Yeah . Got it . Got it . There it is . What ? What ? There 's what ? This popcorn kernel 's been stuck in my molars for the last two weeks . Well , there 's your problem . Gary 's been running his honan transfer equations to include gravitational effects varying as the inverse cube of the distance . I 'm a decorated astronaut . I don 't make those kind of mistakes . Well , now , wait a minute . Look . I 'll show you . I 'll enter the same calculations using what we like to call " the right way . " Then I 'll open the lander file , and I 'll initiate the Mars landing sequence . I 've seen enough . Watch this , fellas . This is ridiculous . Come on . Move , move . There 's nothing wrong with my numbers . They 're perfect . First square capillary . Hey . Watch this , you popcorn geek . See ? I told you it 's the computer . I can explain everything . Skull fracture ! I can 't believe it . Injured while proving himself wrong . Well , I can explain it . He heard you . So , what do we do now ? We postpone it . We can 't , Ben . You 've seen the reports of the surveyor 's satellite that we have orbiting Mars . There are periodic sandstorms on the surface . They go on for months at a time , they make a landing impossible . If we delay now and those storms set in , we lose our window . We can 't launch again then for two years . Then we wait two years . Ben , Ben , Ben , if we cancel this launch , everyone will lose faith in us . In you , in me , in the whole NASA team . But we could sub in a backup , and , as a matter of fact , we have two choices . The first choice , of course , is Gordon Peacock . But ... He hasn 't tested well for space travel . Test him again . Who 's your second choice ? NASA . Yee-haw ! Mr. Wick , can I call you Paul ? No . Are we there yet ? No . How far is it ? Quiet . Can I drive ? No . Can I park it ? Hey , hey , that stubby guy . Is that John Glenn ? Fred , please , come with me . I 'm sure it was him . I have less than a month to see if you have the right stuff to be an astronaut . Fred , I 've gotta get you ... I 've gotta get you a clearance badge . You stay right here . Clearance badge . If you can sign at the bottom . Commander , are you sure we 're headed towards the planet earth ? It looks a heck of a lot like the sun . Of course I 'm sure , you fool . How dare you question my authority ? Morning . Oh . Sorry , sorry . It wasn 't me . It wasn 't me . The cafeteria lady pushed me , mister ... Bud Nesbitt ? Who the hell are you ? Apollo 13 . You 're the one responsible for the ... I mean , when I say responsible , I mean I was responsible for this , all this . Apollo 13 was an accident . Oh , sure . Sure it was . Just like the captain of the Exxon Valdez didn 't see Alaska floatin' there right in front of him . Could I , uh , get your autograph right there ? What , another , uh ... Another accident , Bud ? No , no , no . This was all me . This was ... We were walking down the hall , and the cafeteria lady jumped out of a doorway and pushed me right into Bud Nesbitt , the Apollo 13 wrecker . Bud 's been a little touchy the last , ooh ... 10 , 15 years . Who are you ? I 'm , uh , F ... Fred ... Fred ... Fred ... That 's Fred Randall . Fred Randall . Fred , meet your new roommate . Julie Ford , mission specialist , geologist . Oh , it 's gonna be a real honor sleeping with you . In completely different beds . Fred , she 's not your roommate . He is . I get it . I get it . He 's the rookie . Huh . Good one . The legendary " rooming with the monkey " gag . Ulysses is a chimp , not a monkey . It 's a ch ... And he 's the key to discovering life on Mars . I 'm training him using calls that he 's familiar with to retrieve specific rock samples from underground fissures . Of course . There 's still moisture under the surface , and where there 's water , there could be life . That 's right . Good boy . Or death . Death to anyone who dare to disturb the vicious Martian crust devils with their venomous feet and their wet sucking lips . Uh , Paul . Huh ? Paul , can I talk to you for a second ? Sure . Well , it looks like it 's me and you , my little Ewok . You 're gonna be my very first roommate . So what do you think ? What do I think ? What do you think ? I mean , what is your reasoning here , Paul ? Little Dr. Zaius . Because we 're going to Mars , we should take along a guy from Mars ? He 's a computer genius . He 's supposed to be a little weird . A little ? I am not gonna let a few random personality quirks ground the most important mission of my career . Well , Paul , excuse me for letting my practical concerns get in the way of your career . Wait , wait . This mission means just as much to you as it does to me , Ford , and if Gordon can 't cut it , then this kid is our last hope . Well , that 's impressive . They 're bonding already . Mom , please ! I really wish you 'd stop referring to it as running away from home . It 's only temporary . Going to Mars is not temporary , Freddie . The last time you ran away , it was just to the garage . Oh , I know . You 're rebelling , aren 't you ? Mom , I don 't even know If I 'm going to Mars for sure . Oh . Well , I wish I was . I 've made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches just like you like ' em . It 's a long trip . Mom , I 'm not even hungry . Honestly . Oh . Look . There 's a little moon , a star and a little rocket . I 'm 30 years old . I 'm almost a full-grown man . I 'll take the rocket . Well , isn 't this a treat ? Finally . A place of my own . No one to tell me what to do . Wasn 't me . Hey , there 's no eating puzzles in the house . And surely we don 't jump on the bed . All right , I 'm going out . If you light the place on fire , the number 's 911 . Thank you . Hey , Randall . Come on . I 'll buy you a drink . Wait a second . I 'm not much of a drinker . Gil , round of blast offs for my friend Randall here . Blastoff ? What 's that ? That 's a very special drink . It 's just for us astronauts . Oh , like Tang ? Exactly . Houston , we have ignition . Yes ! Excellent , excellent . Commencing countdown . In three ... Two , one , blast off ! Blast off ! Blast off ! Blast off ! Yee-haw ! Whoa ! Hey , Ford . Got off work early , huh ? Was this necessary , Bill ? Oh , absolutely . Enjoy the show . Oh , geez . Getting someone drunk like this is wrong . Is he the one you want in the jump seat next to you , when you 're 35 million miles away from home ? Julie Ford ! Julie Ford . Come on . Let 's twirl . Twirl . No . Bill , Bill . We 're twirling ! Whoo ! It wasn 't me . It wasn 't me . You kids have fun now , you hear ? Everyone is laughing at us . This is not some frat party , Randall . This is NASA . And some of us have actually earned the right to be here . And we need someone to replace Gary on this mission , or it doesn 't happen . So grow up or get out , but don 't waste my time . Hey , Julie ! I was just tryin ' to , you know ... Fit in . Julie ? Oh , it 's you . Hey , don 't worry , little fella . It 's only thunder . It scares me too . You can 't sleep , huh ? All right . I 'll sing you a little lullaby , but only one . â ™ ª Hairy little monkey Sleeping in the night â ™ ª Close your monkey eyes â ™ ª So monkey , monkey tight â ™ ª And then you 'll know â ™ ª Little monkey doesn 't fright â ™ ª When the thunder goes boom â ™ ª So deep into the night â ™ ª Oh , this Randall guy is a joke . Give him a chance . That 's all I ask . He 's not gonna show , you know . Guy 's an embarrassment to NASA . Now I understand people like him . Trust me . He 'll be a total professional . Listen , you ... Morning , morning . Oh , good , Fred . Look , we 're gonna start off your testing this morning with the isolation chamber . So for the next 24 hours , we 'll see if you can withstand the extreme isolation of space travel . Cut off from all external stimuli . Completely and utterly alone . Yeah , well , not exactly . Your competition is gonna be in the adjacent chamber . Gordo ! Sir . Hey ! Gordon A. Peacock . Computer specialist . Well , well , well , well , well , isn 't this a treat ? Hey , what kind of laptop do you have ? Randall , let 's go ! Close it up . Gordo , you 're on the right . Randall , you 're in the left chamber here . Surely . Initializing 24-hour clock . Hello ! What the heck ? Is that you ? Yes , it 's me ! Prove it ! I asked you first ! Oh ! â ™ ª John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt â ™ ª His name is my name too â ™ ª Whenever we go out , the people always shout â ™ ª John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt â ™ ª He stopped . Oh . â ™ ª People always shout â ™ ª John Jacob Jingleheimer ... â ™ ª John Jacob Jingleheimer ... â ™ ª John Jacob Jingle ... â ™ ª John Jacob Jingle ... â ™ ª Paul , this is inhuman . I say , Freddie , it was absolutely lovely to invite us out of London for the weekend , old boy . Yes , it 's absolutely smashing to be here , Freddie . Well , it 's my pleasure to have you here , Mr. and Mrs. Plumpton . Okay , Bill , let 's get ' em out . Somebody stole my pants . Yes , you did . I didn 't , Horton . I 'm telling you , I never will . Uh , could you guys give me just a few more minutes ? I just started the third act . Yes , close the door . It 's bloody chilly in here . Yes , close the door , you fat ... Don 't use that word around the children . Yes ! Power down . Powering down . Gordo , good work . Whoo ! Hey , way to go , Gordo ! Looks like he beat that motion sickness . Hey , nice ride , fella . Thank you . I probably shouldn 't have had that liverwurst and headcheese sandwich before this . Say , Randall . You know , that iso chamber was cakewalk . Now this little baby , this is a whole another animal . Hey , how fast does this little tree twirl ? Nearly 200 miles an hour . That 's six Gs . Bill there holds the record . Have fun , kid . " Fun " is my Chinese neighbor 's middle name . Man . Smooth sailing , Randall . Stand by . All right , let 's try four Gs . Make it five . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! A little ... Faster ! 5.7 . 5.8 . Thank you . Six Gs . He tied your record , Commander . Should I stop ? Give it a little gas ! Make it seven ! Ah ! Faster ! Faster ! Go ahead . That 's enough ! Slow down ! Mommy ! I want my mommy ! Huh ? And what 's the most important thing at NASA , children ? Safety ! Our Father , who art in heaven ... Here we go , Gary . Be brave , huh ? Why don 't you try walking ? Get out of the way ! Ouch . Uh , sorry I 'm late . I , uh ... I ran into Gary and , uh ... Get in the chair , Fred . The ... The other chair . Sweet swirling onion rings . Capacitor 15 goes into 12 . 17 into two . Then red goes over into the green . That 's it . Good , Randall . Really good . That 's the fastest time I 've ever seen . I , uh , I designed most of these circuits . How 's it goin ' ? Hmm . Oh , he 's doin ' great . Yeah , well , let 's see what happens under emergency conditions . You 've got one minute to complete the board , or your crew dies . Begin . Whoa ! You know what to do . Do it ! You doubt yourself , you fail . Ceiling , wall , floor , you guys . It 's moving too fast . It 'll be a hundred times worse in real life . Come on , Randall . Randall ! Ah ! Randall ! Randall , you 're hopeless . How 'd I do ? One minute and 30 seconds . Just remember , gentlemen , the object is to keep your ping-pong ball airborne as long as possible . We 're testing lung capacity to determine the amount of time you have to survive should a life-support malfunction occur . Just so you know , the record 's three minutes , held by Commander Overbeck . Ford , do me a favor . If by some miracle this kid makes it , watch out for him , will ya ? Sir . Hey , Ben . Bud . So . Bud ! Will you excuse us ? Ah , they 're closing in on Bill 's record . Ben . Bill , what do you think ? I think Gordo 's an astronaut and Randall isn 't . Hmm , I don 't know . Hmm ? He broke the record . It wasn 't me . It wasn 't me . So we will be using a new system which generates artificial gravity on this mission . Miss Ford , do you expect to find life on Mars ? Absolutely . Yes . Along with my crew , including Ulysses , I think it is most likely that we 'll find microscopic unicellular organisms which are very similar to those found in the rock fragments from Antarctica . Vernon Barrett , BBC . Commander Overbeck , we 've all read about the potentially dangerous windstorms on the surface . How 's that gonna affect the mission ? Well , as a former test pilot , I 've experienced my share of wind problems . The ground crew has assured me that if we launch now , these storms shouldn 't be any trouble . Vernon Barrett , BBC . Mr. Wick , has NASA selected a replacement crew member yet ? Well , I 'm glad that you 've asked that question . Ben , you wanna take that one ? Yes , um , I have made a decision on our replacement , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is pleased , as I am pleased , to , um , announce the appointment of astronaut and third crew member of the historic manned mission to Mars , Astronaut Fred Randall . Verify preps complete on C-1FR . I 'm not ready , Bud . Fred , in ' 68 , when President Johnson appointed me chief of operations for the Apollo missions , he gave me three commemorative coins . One for honor , which I gave to Armstrong , one for freedom , I gave that one to Lovell , and one ... For bravery . It hasn 't done me much good . Maybe it 'll mean something to you . Oh . I feel like the cowardly lion . â ™ ª If I â ™ ª Were the king â ™ ª Of the forest â ™ ª I 'd r-r-ruff and I 'd r-r-ruff â ™ ª And I 'd r-r-ruff â ™ ª How about just saying , " Thanks for the cool coin , Bud . " It really means a lot to me . " Oh , yeah . Thanks for the cool coin , Bud . What was the rest ? You 're welcome , Fred . Go on . Good luck , Astronaut Randall ! Engines ready for power transformer . All right , team . Let 's kick the tires and light the fires . Don 't worry , Ulysses . Everything 's gonna be okay . Nothin ' to be scared of . I 'm not scared . There 's no reason why you should be scared . What 's our status ? Go . Roger , 842 . Booster ? Go . APUs Go . OHMS ? Lookin ' good . Houston , we 're getting close here . Initiating final checklist . Fuel cells . Fuel cells , check . Hydraulics . Hydraulics , check . CDPS , panel six . MMU , one . IPL . ATT ? GPC , mode four . KFC . EDP . YMCA . GNC in five . BMW ?

Initiating final launch sequence . All right , people , looking good . T-minus 10 . Let 's light her up . No , not yet ! Ten , nine , eight ... Fifteen , twenty-nine seven , six ... Wait a minute ! There 's a fly in my helmet . ... four , three ... It went up my nose ! ... two , one . We have liftoff ! 0232 , GMT . Yes . Oh , good Lord . I hope I packed him enough underwear . I wouldn 't worry about that , pumpkin . He 's packin his own underwear right now . Oh , my . Are you guys seeing this ? My helmet . Did you feel that ? My face went back like this , and then I ... There was things floating out of my mouth . Could we do that again ? I like this ! Hey , I 'm floating up in the air like a little bird , like a crow . Hey , look at that ! There 's a big field of corn down there , everybody . Engaging artificial gravity in three , two , one . Hey , Randall , take a look out the window . Ooh , wow . It really does look like a giant blueberry . Hi , Mom . Hi , Dad . Commander , can I call you Bill ? No . Are we there yet ? No . Could I drive ? No . I 'm hungry . Oh , Ulysses , it 's yum-yum time . Ow , ow . Ow , the flesh , it burns . Oh , ow , oh . Need some burn ointment . Oh . You hungry , Ulysses ? Here , you eat the monkey fruitcake . Now go sit at the table . Sit at the table . Randall , where 's that dinner ? It 's just coming out of the oven , Bill . Okay , people . Let 's eat up . In 20 minutes , we got a broadcast with the President and the entire free world . If it 's all the same to you guys , I 'm going to sit that one out . So , what 'd you make for dinner ? Prime rib , whipped broccoli and mashed potatoes . Whoa ! Julie 's doin her Old Yeller impression . Please , Pa , I don 't want Yeller to die . Toothpaste . Oh . That 's not potatoes . I 'm sorry . What ? This is not ... Oh , man , it 's hemorrhoid cream . It 's hemorrhoid cream . Hey , swallow your food there , fella . Dear Mr. President . No . Dear world and Mr. President ... That came out of nowhere . Look out , Sally . Be careful you don 't get sucked out when you flush . What ? Happens all the time . Oh , no , Bud 's coin . Come to papa . Good evening , my fellow Americans and citizens of the world . Tonight we are privileged to be speaking live with our courageous Mars astronauts . Good evening , Commander . Good evening , Mr. President . Welcome aboard the Aries . I would like to say that this mission is intended to honor all of the peoples of the world for space is about the highest yearning ... Are we on ? ... of mank ... Of mankind . I don 't mean to cut you off , Commander , but I 'm going to because I spy Fred Randall there , and I believe the people of the world would like to know just why he looks like a Smurf tonight . Officer Randall has some duties to perform ... We are on . ... in another part of the spacecraft right now . If I could just finish this thought . Say hello to the world , son . Me ? Yes , Mr. President . I , uh , I don 't think that I ... Oh , boy . Wait a minute . Tell them what it 's like up here . Yeah , son , you go ahead . Mr. President , sir , from up here , I can ... Well , I can see the whole world out that window , and , uh ... Well , I know down there , there 's a lot of wars and people fighting and so on and whatnot , but from up here , I feel like I could just take the whole world and hold it in my hands , just like a ripe , little blueberry . I feel like I could ... It 's almost like I ... â ™ ª I got the whole world in my hands â ™ ª I 've got the whole world in my hands All right . Now the French . â ™ ª Je suis le papillon sur la table â ™ ª Avec le Chanel No.5 regardons ... Now the Germans ! Oh , come on . Just the Western Hemisphere . â ™ ª He 's got the whole world Come on , Commander . â ™ ª In his hands â ™ ª He 's got the whole wide world in his hands â ™ ª He 's got the whole world in his hands â ™ ª The whole damn world â ™ ª He 's got the whole world in his hands Everybody , now ! â ™ ª He 's got the whole world â ™ ª Go , Father . â ™ ª Om â ™ ª â ™ ª I 've got the whole world in my hands And now the Chinese . Come on , all you Chinese . Hey , there 's my star . What ? My star . When I was a kid , I picked one out of the sky . Called it " Fred 's Star . " It was my own special little place I could go to , and no one could ever find me . That is so weird . I did that too . You did ? Yes . Which one is yours ? Well , um , actually , it 's that one . See ? Just to the right of the North Star , kinda flickering over there . That 's funny . Why ? Well , that one 's right next to mine . It 's , uh ... It 's amazing , isn 't it , Julie ? Yeah . You know , for all the research I 've done , I still don 't really understand what 's out there . I mean , I believe that there 's something . I just , I wish , I wish I ... Well , why don 't ya ? What ? Wish . Use your star . It 's like that Jiminy Cricket song . â ™ ª When you wish upon a star â ™ ª Makes no difference â ™ ª Who you are â ™ ª And when you wish â ™ ª Upon a star â ™ ª Your dreams â ™ ª Come true â ™ ª Jiminy Cricket . I don 't know about this whole hypersleep thing . It 's perfectly safe . Besides , you can 't stay awake for eight months . The boredom would drive you crazy . Eight months ! The eye crust alone could be dangerous . Hey , Commander ! Ah ! It burns the flesh ! So , anyway , Ford , wake me up when we get to Mars . You got it . Good night , ladies . So , I 'll see you in eight months . Boy , I wish I had $ 928 for every time a girl said that to me . Good night , Fred . Oh , good night , Julie Ford . Well , it 's a tale as old as time , Ulysses . Boy meets girl . Boy falls for girl . Girl goes into hypersleep . Whoa ! No ! No , see ? You can 't be in here because yours is over there . This is mine . Okay . I 'm goin ' in here . You can stay right there , and I 'm gonna take yours , you hairy little bed stealer . Good night . Gonna close the door . Ow . Just gonna close this ... Ow . Gotta close the door . Eight-month-old morning breath . Mornin ' glory and hallelujah , Commander . Query , how long have I been asleep ? Thirteen minutes ! â ™ ª Baby â ™ ª Baby No , no . â ™ ª I couldn 't sleep at all last night â ™ ª Doo , doo , doo-doo-doo â ™ ª Just a-thinkin ' of you â ™ ª Doo , doo , doo-doo-doo â ™ ª Baby , they were right â ™ ª Doo , doo , doo-doo-doo â ™ ª Well , I was tossin ' and turnin â ™ ª Turnin ' and tossin' â ™ ª Tossin ' and turnin all night â ™ ª I kicked the blankets off the floor â ™ ª Doo , doo , doo-doo-doo â ™ ª Turned my pillow upside down â ™ ª Doo , doo , doo-doo-doo â ™ ª I never , never did before â ™ ª Doo , doo , doo-doo-doo â ™ ª ' Cause I was tossin ' and turnin â ™ ª Turnin ' and tossin' â ™ ª Tossin ' and turnin all night â ™ ª Jumped out of bed , turned on the light Crazy blanket !

Soft , snowy skin and your tangerine lips . And your ... Les joyeux oreilles , Monsieur Overbeck . Oui ? C 'est bon moustache , non ? Oh , c 'est bon , oui ? Hi ! It 's me again ! Whack , whack , whack ! Wake up ! Wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up ! Fred , come out , Fred . You can 't hide forever , Fred . They 're coming to get you , Fred . Bwana , it 's me , Fred . They 've taken over the ship . Fifty , sixty of them . If I die in the jungle , take this down . I need four barrels of gunpowder , a machete , a goatskin , a guide that speaks Hutu . Fred , snap out of it . Fred , snap out of it . Fred , snap out of it . Fred , snap ... It wasn 't me . Hello . Hello . Hello ? Fred ? May I ask who 's calling ? Over . It 's Bud . Go to the private medical channel . Bud , where have you been ? Over . Why are you awake ? Well , there was a series of very bad mistakes that happened all at once , but everything 's fine and my spirits are high . The ship is in shipshape . And by the way , the Hutu uprising is over . Over . Forget the overs . I don 't know how I 'm gonna keep this from Wick . You don 't have to . I 've already reprogrammed the hypersleep monitors . He doesn 't have to know . Ration your food . I 'll do what I can . Bud , there 's something else . I 've been looking at the latest weather surveyor photos from Mars . What are you talking about ? I can 't be sure , but I have a feeling that when we land , we might run into some nasty windstorms . That 's impossible . None of our people picked that up . I know . I almost missed it myself . If you look in sectors five and six of the Valles Marineris , you 'll see that they 're ... Way too low for this time of year . This could be bad . What do we do ? We do nothing . If Wick finds out you 're awake , he 'll go through the roof . Let me go to him with this weather business . He 'll have no choice . He 'll have to reconsider the mission . Reconsider the mission ? Sure . Hmm , okay . It 's still on . Paul , Paul , look at these new readouts . The danger is real . I don 't have to look at anything , Bud . I have a roomful of experts telling me that everything is just peachy , and you waltz up to me and tell me to reconsider a $ 40 billion mission just because you 've got a hunch ? That 's right . I 'm sorry , Bud . Your hunches are worth about as much as dental floss at a Willie Nelson concert . I 'll be monitoring the situation . If the data doesn 't change ... You 'll leave it to me to make the call , as always . Yeah . Ah ! Voila . February , March , April , May , June , July , August . Whoopsie . Wake-up time . Time for sleep over ! Come on , Ford . I 'm starving . Randall , why are you dressed like that ? What have you been doing ? Oh , just , uh , making coffee . You know , I 'm a morning person . Good morning , Julie . What happened in here ? Uh , well , uh ... I 'll be the first to say it . It , uh , it looks like we 've got space rats . Space rats ? You 've been awake . No ! No , it wasn 't me . It was ... It was the hairy one ! Uh , him ! Naughty ! Well , it 's obvious he 's very sorry , and he doesn 't want to talk about it anymore . Oh , my God . Wow . Turns out Ulysses is one of those rare , genius painting monkeys . That 's food . You 've been awake the whole time , and you used up all of our food , didn 't ya ? No ! No ! Didn 't ya ? Look at this ! Look at this ! What are we supposed to do now ? Fish ? Fish ... This ... Look ! Look ! It 's gone ! We 're doomed ! You understand me ? I 've got backup supplies . I 've got lots of backup sup ... What ? Oh ! Oh , what do you got here ? Anchovy paste . I love that stuff ! Yeah , yeah . Creamed liver . This is good . It 's good for your gums . Gefilte fish ! I 'm not eating gefilte fish for the rest of this trip ! Bill ! What ? We 're here . All right , kids . Here we go . Randall , stop eating and pay attention . Houston , we have separation . Request permission to engage descent burn . Roger , Pilgrim . Confirm separation . Roger that . We have separation confirmed . Pilgrim , you are go for descent burn . Roger that , Houston . Commencing descent burn . Pilgrim is through the high gate at 80 % . Status . Aeroshell deployed . Acceleration rate , normal . Eclis is go . They have entered Martian atmosphere . Bill , we 've got a problem . Glide slope increasing . I see it , Ford . We 're losing stable trajectory . Randall . Status . Commander , we need a five-percent Z-gimbal correction . Five percent . No ! Wait ! Wait ! I need a number , Randall . Ten percent . No ! No ! 12 ! Trajectory 's eroding ! Is it 10 or is it 12 ? 12 ! No , I meant 12 . I 'm sorry . 12 . Initiating 12 % Z-gimbal course correction . Communication shutdown for three minutes . I knew it was 12 . Holy cow . Look at that . Engaging landing thrusters . It 's okay , little fellow . It 's gonna be okay . Pilgrim , this is Houston . Pilgrim , this is Houston . Do you copy ? Pilgrim , this is Houston . Come in , please . Houston , this is Planitia Base . The Pilgrim has landed ! Yeah ! Commander William Overbeck is the first out of the capsule ... Oh ! ... and within seconds will step onto the surface of Mars and into the history books . We all eagerly await ... This is a very big day for us , Ben . Very big . Mr. President , peoples of the world , for a poor farm boy from Iowa , this is one heck of an honor , to be the first man to travel to a distant planet . Fred , go slowly . You must adjust to low gravity . To be the first man to set foot on the surface of Mars . Whoa ! Whoops ! Hey ! It wasn 't me ! Randall , I 'm gonna kick your butt ! My God ! It 's amazing ! We 're the first to ever stand on Mars . Now you 're the biggest idiot on two planets . We 're the first to talk on Mars . Hey , Julie . I 'm the first to walk backwards on Mars . First to blow a kiss on Mars . Oh ! Hey , you 're the first to blush on Mars . Fred ! How 'd you like to be the first guy to die on Mars ? Well , sorry , " Mr. First To Show " Inappropriate Anger On Mars . " I 'm not listenin ' , Randall . I 'm turnin this radio off . Well , you 're the first to not listen to me on Mars . â ™ ª Na , na , na , na , na , na Please talk to me ! â ™ ª Na , na , na , na , na , na â ™ ª I wanna get to know you more for the first time on Mars . Are we there yet ? No . Can I drive ? No ! You never let me drive ! Shut up . Hey , there 's no air bag . What if I go flying through the windshield ? Randall , there is no windshield . Oh . Well , what if I go flying through the front of my helmet ? I 'd die happy . Well , this is it . Valles Marineris . Stop right here , Ford . This 'll be perfect . This is where we plant the flag . Roger . I 'll set up the weather station and take the core drilling samples , and I 'll be back in an hour . We 'll off-load this equipment . Rendezvous back here at 1400 hours . 1400 hours . Check . You be careful out there , Ford . You 're right . This is the spot . This is the perfect spot right here . Yeah . What are you doing , Randall ? Where 's that flag ? It 's coming , Commander . Oh ! Uh-oh . Wasn 't me ! But I 'll get it . I think I saw where it went . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . No , no , no , no , no . Moron ! Who are you talkin ' to , Commander ? Do you realize what you 've just done ? I 've waited my whole life for this moment , to plant a flag on a distant planet . Now I 'm on a distant planet , which was the hard part , and I don 't have a flag 'cause you lost it ! Don 't worry , Commander . I 've got another flag ! I don 't believe this ! A high-flying flag ! A proud flag ! A wonderful flag ! What are you doing ? Oh ! We 're makin ' history , Commander ! Randall ! And salute ! Huh ? Ten-hut ! It 's the President . Why don 't I just throw myself off this cliff ? Why don 't I throw you off this cliff ? Don 't worry . They 're clean . Paul , we got a red on Overbeck . We have a primary oxygen tank leak . We need to preserve his SOP . Solution ? Emergency tie line . We hook him into another suit . Do it , Doc . Uh , Bill , this is Houston . Uh , you got a leak in your primary O2 tank . I see it , Houston . What do we do ? You 've got an emergency line in your plisse . Hook it up with Randall 's spare vent nozzle , and you 'll share it till you get back to the Pilgrim . Houston , is that sanitary ? Hey , Commander ? Yeah ? Do you believe in UFOs at all , or ... Sure , I believe in UFOs . You do ? Yeah . There 's one following me . Huh ? I get it ! You 're funny , Commander . Hey , Commander ? Yeah ? When I was a kid , at night I used to think there was a baker under my bed . Did you ever have anything under your bed ? No . Well , did you ever bend down and look ? No . Well , how do you know there wasn 't a baker under your bed ? Randall , shut up . Hey , Commander ? Yeah ? I seem to be experiencing these intense intestinal cramps . Randall , I 'm trying to conserve oxygen here . But they hurt me so ! Keep it to yourself . Ow . Ow , ow . Wait a minute . Ow , ow . I think if we stay on this heading for another 20 minutes , we 'll see the Pilgrim . What ? I didn 't do anything . Oh , my God . No , no , no , no , no , no . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Don 't do that . No , no . Come on . Hey ... Oh , man ! Oh ! Oh ! Wasn 't me . What do you mean , it wasn 't you ? We 're 35 million miles from the nearest person ! Heart rate up , adrenalin up , stomach muscles spasming . Overbeck 's in distress . Look at these methane levels . Methane . Oh ! Oh , it 's in my mouth . Hey , he who smelt it dealt it ! Ugh ! What ? Oh ! Commander , I 'm having trouble breathing . You 're having trouble breathing ! My eyes are burnin ' ! Truly , it wasn 't me ! Maybe it was Julie . You dog ! Hey , miracles can happen . Blaming this on Julie ! Okay . I admit it was me ! Thank you ! Now that was Julie ! This isn 't good , Bill . I think Fred 's right . Looks like the winds are coming early . Maybe two or three days . Look at these readings I took today . Should still be all right tomorrow . Oh , now , wait a second . No , it 's not gonna be all right . My calculations are telling me that these two Martian high pressure systems are comin ' together faster than any of us could have predicted . Tomorrow . When that happens , we 're nothin ' more than a dust bunny stuck in the bag of a vacuum . You go out there , you 're not comin ' back . What are you doing , Randall ? What are you doing ? What , it 's not enough that you broke every record that I ever set ? That you humiliated me on global television ? That you ruined what should have been the most important moment of my life by stepping ' on Mars first ? That 's not enough for you ! You 've gotta do this ! No . No . This one is mine . We came to Mars to gather fossil samples . We 're not leaving here until I accomplish this . Wait . Bill , I don 't want to abort this mission any more than you do , but ... I know he 's right . If we don 't leave before this storm hits , we don 't leave . What do you suggest ? Tomorrow morning , we check the readings . If they 're bad , we abort . All right . Fine . Let 's get some sleep . What did Overbeck say ? He said we should wait till morning . You know , Bud , maybe I was wrong about the winds . Maybe I shouldn 't have said anything . I wanna tell you something , Fred , about the 13 mission . The day before launch , I ... I caught what seemed to be a minor glitch in the tank stirring circuits . Didn 't look serious , but I went to Wick . I told him we needed to postpone until we could green-light the system . He said there was no way we were gonna push back the launch date . He said that I was overreacting . That I was imagining a problem when there was none . So Apollo 13 was Wick 's fault . No , no . I had every right and authority to stop that launch , but I didn 't . I didn 't make the call . If those three astronauts hadn 't pulled off a number of last-minute major miracles , they would have been dead , and it would have been my fault . I 'm not gonna let that happen this time . I 'm gonna get you guys out of this . Hey , Bud . What ? I 'd be proud to end up like you . I copy that . Bud out . Ugh ! The mushroom people are coming ! Fred ! Wake up ! Get them away ! The mushroom people ! Fred ! Fred ! Bill is gone . He took Ulysses and the spare backpack , and he is gone . Sweet mother of meat ! Huh ? Uh-oh ! All right , buddy . Here we go . Go on . Go on . How are they doing up there , Paul ? Oh , good morning , sir . Yes . We 're just about to wake the crew . Would you like this one , sir ? Oh , great ! It 's over , Paul . Sir , I 'm making the call . We abort now . No one 's listening to you , Bud . Don 't make me call security . I 'm not gonna stand by and let another disaster happen . This man has continually ignored the warnings of our crew on Mars . Security , would you come in here , please ? Our mission is in serious jeopardy , sir . Bud ... Don 't make this any harder than it already is . Don 't do this , sir . Bud , would you take it easy ? We 're all under a lot of stress . You just need to rest , that 's all . Ben , those people are gonna die . Bud , you have totally lost it ! We haven 't had any negative reports . Would you get him out of here , please ? Paul , we 've got a contact at emergency frequency . On screen . Pilgrim , this is Houston . Houston , the storms are here . Wind speed at , uh ... Forty-five . Forty-five miles per hour and rising ! Visibility dropping . Houston , what should we do ? Houston , please advise ! Paul . Randall . No , that 's ... That 's impossible . Our weather pattern analysis ... Mr. Wick , this is bad . I don 't think I 've ever seen anything like this before . It reminds me of a French Canadian ... A tennis racket stuck to the back of my ... Bubbling out of my sister 's ... Brazilian donkey ... I don 't think I can make myself any clearer . Wick , get them off that planet ! Do as he says , Paul . We had no way of knowing . I followed procedure , Ben . I followed procedure here . Paul , unplug and go home . Unplug and go home ? Nesbitt , you 're in command . Houston , do you copy ? Houston , come in ! Pilgrim , we copy . Please stand by . Well , don 't stare at me , people . We got a crew out there ! Let 's bring them home ! Houston , wind speed continues to increase . This is bad , Paul . Ford , it 's Bud . Listen carefully . If the wind keeps building at this rate , in 20 minutes , lift-off will be impossible . Launch now . No ! Commander Overbeck and Ulysses are still out there . They 're lost now . You 're not . Launch ! I 'm going after them . What ? Fred ! Fred , answer me ! Fred ! Can 't hear you . We 're fading out fast . Fred ! If I 'm not back in 20 minutes , you 've gotta take off without me ! Fred ! You will be back . Twenty minutes . Fred ! And then take off ! Twenty minutes , right ? Not 15 or anything ? All right . Twenty-one is okay too . Ford , what 's going on ? What 's happening ? I 'm losing you . Julie ! Commander ! Commander Overbeck ! Ulysses ! Ulysses ! Where are you ? Answer me ! There you are . How many times have I told you not to wander around in a Martian dust storm ? We 've gotta find the commander . Oh . Where are they ? Commander ! Commander Overbeck ! Randall ? Commander ? Is that you ? Randall ! It is you ! All right . Stand back , little fella . Nothing to see here . Commander . What are you doing here ? Get back to the ship and save yourself . Sorry , Commander . I can 't do that . That 's an order ! I 've gotta get you out . I can 't lift it . They say that when a mother 's child is trapped , the rush of her adrenaline gives her the strength of 20 men . Hurry , Commander ! Call me " Mommy . " What ? Call me " Mommy " now ! I 'd rather die in the Martian dirt ! Who am I ? Would you just lift up the stinking thing ? Who am I ? Mommy . Say it like you love me . Mommy . Please , Mommy . Save me . Mommy 's coming , little Billy . Save me ! Live , child ! Live ! You 're alive , little Billy ! Don 't you ever call me " little Billy " ! That 's no way to talk to your mother ! Houston , this is Ford ! Julie , where 's Fred ? Still out there . I 'm initiating launch sequence . Wait ! They still have time to get back ! Give them a chance ! I know what I 'm doing . Which way , Commander ? I don 't know . Can 't get a reading . Let 's go down behind that rock . Come on , Ulysses ! I 'm gonna go out there and take a closer look . It 's the Pilgrim . It 's too late . She 's taking off ! She 's guiding us with the engines . Come on ! I 'll get Ulysses . Ulyss ... Ulysses ! Tank 's empty ! We 'll share air ! We don 't have a spare hose . Remember ? Well , then I 'll give him mine . You don 't leave friends behind . What are you gonna do ? Hold your breath ? You 'll never make it back to the Pilgrim . Don 't forget , Commander . I 'm the new NASA record holder for lung capacity . That was three minutes ! This is what ... Four , maybe five ? What , you ignore me the whole trip , but now that I have no air , you wanna chat ? Randall ! Randall ! Randall ! Randall ! Oh , no ! Not now ! Twenty minutes are up , Julie . Wait , wait . I see someone . Ford , what 's going on ? I got it . Ford , who is it ? Julie , do you copy ? Julie ! Fred , are you there ? Fred ? Copy ! Somebody ! Bill ! Where 's Fred ? He should have been here . Don 't launch . There he is ! Fred . Wait . He 's going the other way . Fred ! Hey ! Hey ! Fred ! Come back ! Hey , get me out of this tank . What are you doing ? It 's empty , anyway . He 's holding his breath out there . Oh , my God ! If we 're not back in five minutes ... Hurry ! Hurry , Bill ! Bill ! Bill , is he all right ? Is he okay ? He 's not breathing . Get his helmet off ! Oh ! Don 't even think about it , Randall . Houston ! Houston , this is Pilgrim ! Oh . Carol Ann ? Go into the light , honey . Fred ! Honey , go into the light . Houston ! Oh , it 's you ! Ulysses ! No , Julie . No . Ulysses needs air . Oh ! Houston . Come in , please . We 're on board . We need go for launch ! Get the hell out of there . Roger that , Houston . My God ! Preparing for launch . Not the hairy one ! Take me ! Running main thrusters . Rocket boosters intact . Fred ! Fred ! Fred ! Fred , he 's fine . He 's just resting ! MX-5 ready to go . Main thrusters go in three . Two . One . Hold on . We have lift-off . Fifty meters . One hundred , and increasing velocity . Two hundred meters . Course is good . Nice flying , Uncle Walnut . One thousand . Two thousand . Increasing velocity . Five thousand . Six thousand . Eight thousand . Just a little higher . You 're almost clear of the storm . Ten thousand . Come on . All systems green . I think we made it . What the hell was that ? Houston ! Houston , we 've had an impact ! It wasn 't me ! APU down . Navigation controls are compromised . Switching to auxiliary power ! We 're losing veloc ... Status . Eclis down , OHMS down , visual contact out . We 've got a total kill here . Solutions . Randall rewires the entire operation system circuitry in less than two minutes . End of solutions . Bud , what do we do here ? We do nothing . Pilgrim is in a free fall . Left controls are out . Randall , I need the engine computers up now ! This time it was definitely not me ! I 'm switching to manual . Randall , check below ! Randall ! How 's it look down there ? Like this ... Well , fix it ! Well , you stop this ship from tumbling and give me about a week ! I can 't stop the tumbling , and you 've got two minutes ! Whoa ! To recap the story the Pilgrim was caught in a violent sandstorm , and is now tumbling towards the Martian surface . We 're standing by to hear what the latest NASA has to say about this terrible incident . 4,500 meters . Dropping fast . 90 seconds to impact . You tell me straight , Nesbitt . Can he do it ? Only a complete genius or a total fool could ever pull this off . Lucky for us , he 's both . Any power yet , Bill ? I got nothin ' . We 're in a flat spin . Randall , this would be a terrific time to fix that ! Any time now would be good ! 60 seconds to impact . System is still red . We 've established audio link . Fred ! Fred , can you hear me ? Bud , I 'm down below . Everything 's spinning , and I don 't know what to do . Focus , Fred . It 's like in training . The rotating chair with the wires . Well , that was a real winner . You can do this . Trust your instincts . Now ! Come on . You can do it ! Thirty seconds ! Don 't give up , Fred ! Come on , Fred . Yeah ! Gotta close the circuit ! Come on , Fred . Fifteen seconds to impact . Need something . Need so ... You 're the man , Fred ! Come on ! Ten seconds . Bud 's coin ! Come on ! Yee-haw ! I got power ! You did it , Fred ! Put on the porch light , Mama . We 're comin ' home ! Yeah ! Whoa ! Oh , Magoo ! Uh , you 've , uh , done it again , sir . That , uh , little space rock 's gonna make you real famous , Julie Ford . So , uh , what 's next for you , Rocketman ? Well , uh , actually , I was thinking about asking you to dance . Oh . Well , uh , thanks anyway , but I think we 've done that before . Now wait a second . I had a little time on my hands recently , and I 've been practicing . That and I got a little bit creative with the , uh , space blankets . â ™ ª When you wish upon a star â ™ ª Makes no difference who you are â ™ ª Anything your heart desires â ™ ª Will come to you â ™ ª Like a boat out of the blue â ™ ª Fate steps in and sees you through â ™ ª When you wish â ™ ª Upon a star â ™ ª Your dreams â ™ ª Come true â ™ ª Sweet dreams , lovebirds . So , I guess I 'll see you in eight months . Good night , Fred . It 's a tale as old as time , Ulysses . Boy meets girl , boy falls for girl , boy and girl return to home planet , get a nice little house with a white picket fence , live happily ... No ! No , not again ! Ulysses ! No ! â ™ ª Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone â ™ ª And I think it 's gonna be a long , long time â ™ ª Till touchdown brings me round again to find â ™ ª I 'm not the man they think I am at home â ™ ª Oh , no , no , no â ™ ª I 'm a rocket man â ™ ª Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone â ™ ª Mars ain 't the kind of place to raise your kids â ™ ª In fact , it 's cold as hell â ™ ª And there 's no one there to raise them â ™ ª If you did â ™ ª And all the science â ™ ª I don 't understand â ™ ª It 's just my job five days a week â ™ ª A rocket man â ™ ª Rocket man â ™ ª And I think it 's gonna be a long , long time â ™ ª Till touchdown brings me round again to find â ™ ª I 'm not the man they think I am at home â ™ ª Oh , no , no , no â ™ ª I 'm a rocket man â ™ ª Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone â ™ ª And I think it 's gonna be a long , long time â ™ ª And I think it 's gonna be a long , long time â ™ ª

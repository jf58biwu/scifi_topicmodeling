 - DrCabrera ! - Where is he ? - Trauma . - Who transferred him from ICU ? I did . During prep for therapeutic plasmapheresis he went into shock . - Vitals ? - Not good . Pulse is 40 , blood pressure 80 over 50 . His GCS is six . Get on the phone to the FBI . There 's an Agent Scully that should be notified . - The FBI ? - This man is an FBI agent . - What 's wrong with him ? - What 's wrong is he 's going to die . Can you hear me ? Mr Skinner ? I 'm not understanding . Can you speak up ? - What did he say ? - A name . He 's coding on us . clear . Dr Cabrera , clear ! Dr Cabrera ? Let him go . Every minute of every day , we choose : who we are , who we forgive , who we defend and protect . To choose a side or to walk the line . To play the middle . To straddle the fence between what is and what should be . This was the course I chose . Trying to find the delicate balance of interests that can never exist , choosing by not choosing , defending a center which cannot hold . So death chose for me . Go easy on him , SIugger . I need him to lock up for me tonight , OK ? Don 't telegraph that left , Dre . Stevie Wonder would see that one comin ' ! You 're fightin ' the FBI now , Dre . Fight smart . Go ! Hey , SIugger ? You OK ? SIugger , can you hear me ? Talk to me . You all right ? Mr Skinner ? Mr Skinner ? Hi . You gonna stick with us now ? - Do you remember what happened ? - I was boxing . I must 've gotten tagged . Yes , you did . At least you didn 't get your ear bit off . That 's something , right ? Doctor plant 'II be with you in a minute . Yeah , Skinner . Hello ? Walter Skinner . Who is this ? Have you heard the news ? It 's ... in ... you . What is this ? You ... have 24 hours ... to go . What is this ? What do you want ? You are ... already dead . Mr Skinner . I didn 't expect to see you up and around . You must be feeling better . Can you take a seat on the table for me , please ? I 'm Dr plant . I was here with you before . - You probably don 't remember . - No . The good news is your dilation 's back to normal . plus , you still have both your ears . I heard that one . I 'm gonna release you . But I suggest that you rethink the boxing . You 're not 20 anymore . There 's nothing wrong with me ? You got your bell rung . Other than that , I think you 're fine . You might want to ice that bruise . What bruise ? Right here . - How the hell did I get that ? - Must 've taken a hard one to the ribs . But there 's nothing broken . No internal bleeding . Like I said , you 'II live . Thanks . What is it , Agent Mulder ? I just thought I 'd poke my head in and say " hey . " Hey . - Are you sleepin ' one off ? - No , I was just havin ' trouble seeing . - It 's nothing . I just didn 't think I should drive . - You gonna be all right , sir ? He 's gonna tell you he 's all right . - There 's nothing wrong with me . - Not that I could tell if there was . - Why are the lights out ? - He 's havin ' trouble with his eyes . He 's also got a nasty bruise on his ribcage . - What 'd you do ? - It 's nothing . Says who ? Says the doctor who released me from the hospital . That was the second opinion . The first was unsolicited . A phone call at the hospital . A scrambled voice telling him he had 24 hours to live . That was somebody yanking my chain . I got a clean bill of health . In the Iast 48 hours , did you eat or drink anything that tasted metallic or odd ? You think that I 'm poisoned ? - Did the doctor take your blood ? - Yes , and it checked out . - Poisoning could 've been overlooked . - If so , why call and tell me at the hospital ? To scare you . See what you 'd do , who you 'd turn to . - This is about you . - Or about the X-Files . You are so paranoid , Mulder . You 're not even on the X-Files anymore . No , but you are . You still supervise them . What happened today ? Anything out of the ordinary ? I 'm not gonna play this game . It could 've been anything . It could 've been the slightest touch or a handshake . - This morning , you woke up ... - I woke up . - alone ? - Yes . alone . - How 'd you get to the office ? - The same way that I always do . I drove . - Then what ? - Nothing . I had meetings , I went to the gym , - to the hospital and now I 'm here . - Just slow down . One step at a time . How 'd you get from the parking garage to your office ? - The elevator . - And then what ? I walked up the hallway . I passed the same dozen people that I pass every morning . I went to my office . I said good morning to my secretary . And she said good morning to me . I made calls , I did paperwork , then I was here for the rest of the day . Think . There 's gotta be something . In the hallway , there was a man . He stopped me . He wanted to know the time . Did he touch you ? He grabbed me . On my right wrist . It wouldn 't necessarily leave a mark . Some poisons are absorbed through the skin . What time was it ? There you are . That 's him . Right there . Wait a second , back up . It can 't be . That 's Kenneth Orgel . Advisor to a Senate subcommittee on Ethics in New Technology . - He 's a scientist ? - A physicist . Very well-known , as far as physicists go . He signed in here as a visitor to the office of Assistant Director Walter Skinner . - Why would he be coming to see you ? - I 'd Iike to ask him that myself . If he poisoned you , you should be off your feet and under a doctor 's care . I 'm gonna put a gun to his head , find out why and ask him how he 's gonna make me well . - What hospital was he in ? - St Katherine 's . - Yes ? - Dr Orgel ? - Kenneth Orgel ? - Yes . Do you know who I am ? No . My name 's Walter Skinner . I 'm an assistant director at the FBI . Dr Orgel , you visited the FBI this morning . You came to see Mr Skinner . No . You must be mistaken . Sorry . You 'II have to come back another time . - Go around back . - What ? please , you 're bothering me . Federal Agent ! Go ! Drop the gun . Drop it ! So 's your mom . Give it a rest ! - Let him go , Agent Mulder . - What ? He 's got diplomatic papers . It 's our mistake . You can go . Just let him go . Get inside . The police 'II be here any moment and I don 't have time to answer questions . He 's alexander Lazreg . L-a-z-r-e-g . He 's a cultural attache with the Tunisian Mission here in DC . - See what else you can find out . - You need to get to the hospital . No , I 'm tryin ' to stay out of one . - The boxer . FBI . - You released him earlier this evening . - Is he not all right ? - That 's why I 'm here . - He may have been poisoned . - You 're kidding . By whom ? I don 't know . In fact , I 'm not even sure what I 'm looking for . You 're lucky . He 's on a government HMO . - No one 's even handled his samples yet . - Is this them in here ? I 'm not supposed to let you have those . Not without a written release from the patient . We may not have time . He may not have time either . - He had no symptoms of poisoning . - Are you sure these haven 't been processed ? I 'm not sure , but I doubt they 've even been touched . - I 'm not so sure you should be doin ' that . - This a crime scene . What should I do ? I 'm just concerned for Dr Orgel 's personal property . And preservation of evidence . I 'd be a Iot more concerned for the preservation of Dr Orgel . Hello , Senator . It 's carbon . Pure carbon . How in the world would that get into his bloodstream ? - And how is it working as a poison ? - By all rights , it shouldn 't be . Look at them , just rattling around in solution . It 's just bizarre . - Did you see that ? - Did you just touch something ? No , I didn 't . They just multiplied . Look ! They just did it again ! Zooming in . What the hell are they ? Wait here , please . I don 't have to tell you how late it is , do I , Agent Mulder ? But I suspect that wasn 't a consideration of yours . Actually , time is my only consideration , Senator . This was taken only three days ago . It 's of you and Dr Kenneth Orgel holding a Senate resolution . SR819 , I think it 's called . What is that ? A funding bill . What is this all about ? A friend of mine is going to die because of SR819 . I don 't know how , I don 't even know why . - But I bet you do . - What are you talking about ? I don 't even really know yet . AII I have is a Tunisian diplomat , this Dr Kenneth Orgel , this health bill , SR819 , all leading to a plot to kill an assistant director of the FBI . Does that make sense ? The bill you refer to will provide money and supplies to the World Health Organization , medical technology to Third World countries . I have aided you in the past with information , Fox , and advice , which right now is to leave here at once , and never again suggest to anyone my involvement in any such dark intrigue . - Am I understood ? - This man may die . - He may only have a few hours to live . - My intention is to save lives , Fox . But I can 't save his . Good night , Fox . Drive safely . Dr plant ? - What ? What is it ? - I think I found it . I think I found what the carbon 's doing . It 's not just reproducing itself . It has behavior . It 's creating something . A matrix , stimulated by blood flow in response to movement . It 's multiplying , then solidifying in an orderly fashion . It 's building valves or dams in the vascular system . It 's building a heart attack . Dr plant ? You 're doing blood work on a Walter Skinner ? Yes . A Walter Skinner has been picked up by paramedics at a parking garage . - Where are they taking him ? - DC General . Did you see this ? We 've got some sort of extreme vascular event here . - How is he even still alive ? - We 'II take the Ieft arm first . Mark it just above the bicep . - Let 's get to it . - I 'II get this side . - Hey , you ! Out ! - I know this man . - I don 't care . This is a sterile operating room . - Get them out . I 'm sorry . We 've been investigating his illness . What are you doing ? - If he 's gonna live , he has to lose his arms . - That won 't save him . It 's his blood . - Who the hell is this woman ? - She 's a doctor . You 're not gonna solve anything until you get a scope into him . Nothing else is gonna work . If you wanna save this man , listen to what I 'm saying . It 's OK , sir . Lie back down . We 're just moving you to another room . Who did this to me ? That 's what Mulder 's trying to figure out right now . But we 're gonna take good care of you . I promise . We 're gonna do everything we can . I don 't know . I can 't remember . Sir ? Is that you ? - Agent Mulder ? - Do you have the key to this drawer ? - What are you doing ? - Skinner 's in the hospital . - Somebody poisoned him . - Why ? - For doing his job . - I don 't understand . I 'm looking for anything that relates to Senate Resolution 819 . If you wanna save his life , open this drawer . - I don 't have the key . - Do you have a letter opener ? Something ? Is he going to be all right ? - What 's his condition ? - He 's stable , but it 's not good . He 's got extreme vascular trauma and distention . His blood has become a weapon against his body . - Can you fight it ? - We don 't know what it is . The best that we can do is keep Iasering his arteries open . But it 's only gonna be a matter of time before we lose . It 's building walls in his vessels faster than we can tear them down . We don 't have the technology to combat it . - Maybe we do . - What is this ? I found this in Skinner 's morning mail . He was doing a security check on a Senate bill for violation of trade laws involving sensitive technology . But this is just a routine procedure . - The FBI does dozens a year . - This bill was going to vote in the Senate . AII it was waiting on was Skinner 's review and an analysis by Dr Kenneth Orgel . You 're sayin ' Dr Orgel poisoned Skinner to cover up his analysis ? Orgel didn 't poison anybody . He came to the FBI to tell Skinner what he knew - that there was a gross violation of export laws involving new technology . - New technology ? - You know what that means ? I think I might . It 's not me . You want to get this ? It was in his pants pocket . - Hello ? - Might as well give up . - Who is it ? - It 's a computer-synth voice . You can 't stop it . - Somebody that must know he 's here . - Walter Skinner . Your time ... Federal Agent ! Stop right there ! - Yes . - The bill is in danger , Senator . - A new threat has emerged . - You shouldn 't have called me . - blood will be on your hands . - I don 't buy your hollow threats . But Dr Orgel does . You can ask him . What have you done with him ? I can tell you where to find him . The car 's leased , part of a fleet service that services the diplomatic counsel corps . - What forensic evidence did you lift ? - Not much on the outside . Not surprising , considering the condition of the vehicle . Inside we found a couple of hairs . Human . From an expensive wig . Don 't hate me cos I 'm beautiful . What else ? We scraped the tire treads . Found something odd . It 's full of polychlorinated biphenyls . PCBs . Over 500 parts per million . That 's the kind of levels they used to see in the 1970s . Before the EPA got fangs . - From where ? - The PCBs are saturated evenly in the clay . A demo site , maybe . Or an old power plant . Who 's there ? Is someone there ? Senator , please let me go . I need ... water . - Who did this to you ? - Hurry . please . It 's ... killing me . They believe you have exposed them to the FBI . To Walter Skinner . I told the FBI nothing . I told them nothing . please . I promise not to expose anyone . Sir , there 's something I 'd Iike to try . It 's a treatment called therapeutic plasmapheresis . It requires filtering all of the blood in your body . It 's a radical procedure , and there is a danger that your body might go into shock . I 'm in your hands . I think I owe you an apology , Scully . - You and Mulder . - Sir ? I 've been lying here , thinking . Your quest . - It should have been mine . - What do you mean ? If I die now , I die in vain . I have nothing to show for myself . My life . Sir , you know that 's not true . It is . I can see now that ... I always played it safe . I wouldn 't take sides . Wouldn 't let you and Mulder ... pull me in . You 've been our ally more times than I can say . Not the kind of ally that I could have been . - I remember now . - What ? - I can 't see his face . He has a beard . - Try . He was at the gym . At the hospital . He killed that man . He was at the FBI when Orgel approached me . He was following you ? The tape . He 's on the surveillance tape . You must be surprised to see me here . - I 'm sure I 'm not the man you 're looking for . - Where is he ? Where 's Orgel ? - Orgel is dead . - I don 't believe you . You lied to me this morning , you 're lying to me now . - Drop this , Fox . - Where is Orgel ? I need to know what he knows ! A friend of mine is dying ! I tell you , they killed him . What Orgel knows died with him . Then tell me what you know , Senator ! This is about SR819 , isn 't it ? - What the hell did they put in Skinner ? - I 'm sure you already have some idea , Fox . It 's the same technology SR819 will export . Technology that the world believes is purely theoretical . Nanotechnology . Microscopic , atom-sized machines . - Machines can be stopped . - Your friend is already dead . - I don 't believe that . - If you pursue this , they will kill you . Not before I expose you and your role in this . My role ? I am a victim here . Don 't you understand that ? I 'm fighting for my Iife ! - I will stop this ! - It 's too late , Fox ! It 's too late ! He 's coding on us . clear ! Dr Cabrera , clear ! Dr Cabrera ? Let him go . Call time of death ... 9 : 33 . I 've spoken with your doctors and your prognosis is excellent . Whatever you were infected with appears to be dormant . And your recovery is being hailed as a miracle . The man who poisoned you was at the FBI that day . Scully was able to pull these off the security videotapes . We 're hoping it might jog your memory . Maybe you can identify this man . No , I 'm sorry . SR819 was withdrawn by committee late last night , without explanation . - Good . So this man failed , then . - If that was his true motive . If he poisoned you to prevent you from investigating SR819 , why call you to tell you that ? This man worked for the government that was to receive this technology . He killed one of his own to save you . So you still think this was about you ? About the X-Files ? Yes . Yes , I do , and I have an idea who may be behind all this , but I 'd need your authority to continue the investigation . I have neither the authority nor the will to allow your continued inquiry into this matter . You 'II perform your duties as directed by AD Kersh and only AD Kersh . Sir ? This matter 's closed , agents . Am I clear ? I 've been expecting you to show up . You know I can push the button any time . What do you want from me ? What 's this about , Krycek ? AII in good time . Visiontext Subtitles : Karin Baker US ENGLISH

It 's the happiest place orbiting Earth . - Let 's go already . - We have a crate to deliver . Let 's dump it and say we delivered it . Too much work . Let 's burn it and say we dumped it . - If everyone 's finished being stupid- - - I had more , but you go ahead . We 'll deliver that crate like professionals . I 've never been to the moon . All right , we 'll deliver that crate like professionals ... ... then we 'll ride the bumper cars . Amy , help Fry hoist the crate , then lock up when you 're done . Be careful .

Welcome to Luna Park ! I 'll have to confiscate your alcohol . Better mascots than you have tried . I still have my self-respect . [ LAUGHS ] [ CRIES ] Who buys this trash ? Idiots who need gifts for other idiots . I got you guys refrigerator magnets ! Get it off ! Get it off ! Get it- - Uh-oh ! How many roads must a man walk down Before you ... . [ BARKS ] [ PANTS ] Keep those things off of me . Magnets screw up my inhibition unit . So you flip out and act like a crazy folk singer ? Yes . I guess a robot would have to be crazy to want to be a folk singer . We 're whalers on the moon We carry a harpoon There ain ' t no whales so we tell tall tales and sing a whaling tune Bender ! Bender ! Over here ! Oh , jeez . I went to high school with that guy . ANNOUNCER : Monsanto presents " The Goophy Gopher Revue ! " Why does moon rock taste better than Earth rock ? Because it 's a little meatier . This is weak . Address all complaints to the Monsanto Corporation . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . This place is great , but it 's so artificial . The gravity , the air , the gophers . You might as well stay on Earth . That 's what I came to see ! I want to jump like an astronaut . Screw this phony stuff . But the phony stuff is fun . It 's boring out there . You 're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem ... ... and doesn 't see the Sexeteria . Maybe I 'll take Fry on the lunar rover ride . You wear a spacesuit and drive around . It 's educational , so no line . I don 't care how educational it is . Let 's do it ! Next year in Jerusalem ! Finally . Get ready for some serious moon action . ANNOUNCER : The story of lunar exploration started with one man : ANNOUNCER : A man with a dream . One of these days , Alice ! Bang ! Zoom ! Straight to the moon ! Wow ! I never realized the first astronauts were so fat . That 's no astronaut . It 's a TV comedian . He used space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife . Wow ! I could swear I was really playing Virtual Skeeball ! Look , it 's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer . The keys to the ship ! They must have fallen into the crate . - Leela 's gonna kill me . - No , she 'll probably make me do it . Could you get those keys out for me ? What do I look like , a guy who 's not lazy ? [ CURSES IN CHINESE ] ANNOUNCER : No one knows where , when or how man first landed on the moon . - I do . - But our fun-gineers think it might 've happened something like this : We 're whalers on the moon We carry a harpoon There ain ' t no whales so we tell tall tales and sing a whaling tune That 's not how it happened . I don 't see you with a fun-gineering degree . This is stupid . I 'll take this out to the real moon . This is my first mission , and I won 't let us get in any trouble . - Besides , the car 's on a track . - Not for long . I died doing what I loved . Okay , you 're on the surface . I 'll give you 1 0 minutes . You 'll get bored , turn around and apologize for being a jerk . - Agreed . - Agreed . Yee-haw ! Whoo ! Yeah ! Crank up the radio ! We 're whalers on the- - Time 's up .

Ooh ! Uh ... . I 'm ready to go back now . We 're gonna die ! It 's every man for himself ! Help me , Leela ! You did it . We 're safe . No . Now we 're gonna die . It 's every man for himself !

I know how to make love . Oh ! Here , let me do it . Uh ... . Ee ... . Lousy arm . Must be rigged . That 's her , officers ! That 's the woman who programmed me for evil ! Yeah , well , I 'm gonna go build my own theme park ... ... with blackjack and hookers . In fact , forget the park . [ FRY PANTS ] I 'm sorry , Leela . I can 't go on any further . Just leave me in that barn over there . [ PANTING ] [ SIGHING ] Thank God ! - Trespassers , eh ? - No , we 're amusement park patrons . That 's a wicked , sinful place . Tilt-A-Whirl 's okay , but the rest is mighty wicked . We 're out of oxygen . Can we borrow some ? Borrow ? Looky here , city girl . Oxygen don 't grow on trees . You 'll earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm . You can go back to your theme park at sunup . We could do chores for a few hours . Night lasts two weeks on the moon . Yep . Drops down to minus 1 73 . Fahrenheit or Celsius ? First one , then the other . Them spacesuits ain 't heated . You 're going nowhere till sunrise . Sleep in the barn . Just don 't be a-touching my three beautiful robot daughters , you hear ? Robot daughters ? - This here is Lulabelle Seven . - Yoo-hoo ! - Daisy Mae 1 28K . - Yoo-hoo ! And the Crush-A-Nator ! Yoo-hoo . Whoo . LEELA : I said to turn around and go back to the park . But the park was too phony . We had to see the real moon . It was great ! We saw craters and rocks . That incredible rock that looked like a crater , and these fellas . Face it . The moon 's a dump . A boring , dried-up wasteland . The only reason people come is for the tacky amusement park . - Can 't you accept that ? - I guess I can 't . [ GUNSHOT ] I 'll learn you to sleep with my robot daughters ! - He 'll never find me in here ! - Bender ? You didn 't touch the Crush-A-Nator , did you ? Of course not . A lady that fine , you gotta romance first . [ SCREAMS ] No , you don 't ! Come here , Crush-A-Nator ! Yes , Pa . - It 's too low ! - Hang on . Hang on . Jump ! Hold on to your helmet ! [ CHEERING ] - Yes ! - Oh , boy ! Goldarn it , Crush-A-Nator ! Jump ! No , Pa . I love him . Oh ! Hey , cool ! Dark side of the moon . Nightfall 's coming . - Hurry , before we freeze ! - What do you mean " we , " mammal ? Oh , dear . I really ought to do something . But I am already in my pajamas . We can 't outrun it forever . Over there ! Look ! It 's the moon landing site ! We found it ! Quick , get in . It 's that flag from MTV ! And Neil Armstrong 's footprint ! My foot 's bigger . Isn 't this the greatest thing you 've ever seen ? Look around . A crummy plastic flag and a dead man 's tracks in the dust . LEELA : Now get in here before you freeze . Oh , no room for Bender , huh ? Fine . I 'll build my own lunar lander , with blackjack and hookers . In fact , forget the lunar lander and the blackjack . Screw the whole thing . If the oxygen holds out , we might live long enough to starve to death . I 'm sorry . I never should have dragged you out here . You shouldn 't have . I still don 't get what the big attraction is . [ SIGHS ] I never told anybody this ... ... but I 'd look at the moon and dream of being an astronaut . I didn 't have the grades , nor physical endurance . Plus , nobody liked spending a week with me . A week would be a little much . The moon was this awesome , mysterious thing hanging in the sky ... ... where you 'd never reach it , no matter how much you wanted to . You 're right . Once you 're actually here , it 's just a big , dull rock . I wanted you to see it through my eyes , the way I used to . Fry , look . It really is beautiful . I don 't know why I never noticed before . [ PANTS ] You had to come back for the Crush-A-Nator . Well , I got you this time . It 's Amy ! We 're saved ! Where did she learn to operate the controls like that ? Not the magnet ! No ! No ! No ! Uh-oh . [ CHEERS ] She 'll be coming around the mountain when she comes I 'll kill you , Amy ! She 'll be coming around the mountain She 'll be coming around the mountain Dang it ! [ GASPS ] She 'll be riding six white horses When she comes She 'll be riding six white horses When she comes I 'm pretty good . She 'll be riding ... . So , was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about ? Well , close enough . One more time ! Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

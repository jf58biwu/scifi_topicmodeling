 North perimeter clear . No sign of him . - South access clear . - Camera One , pan right . - Mulder , make for the west entrance . - Zoom in . - West gate , no sign of suspect . - Two , angle south entrance . - Mid park clear . - There . - The bus . - Three , zoom in . Stay close , Mulder . We have alpha off an eastbound metro bus . I have alpha . Heading south . One , follow suspect . Beta . Contact made . AII right , hold your positions . Stand by . - What 's he looking at ? - Two , pick it up . Mulder , he 's watching you . - He 's reaching for something . - One , zoom in . Take it slowly . slowly . Wait for it . What ? What ? - What just happened ? - I don 't know what the hell happened . Anybody ! I need a doctor over here . My friend 's sick here . I don 't know what 's goin ' ... Oh , God . He just fell . Oh , man . - What 's goin ' on ? - I can 't see anything . - Beta target down . - We 've lost alpha . Go , go , go . - He 's heading west . He 's on the move . - I 'm on him . Maintain your position on the downed Beta . Find the alpha on Three . Federal Agent . Step aside . - Oh , my God . - What is it ? - What the hell did he do to him ? - What are you saying ? Come on . Talk to me . - It 's eaten away his flesh . - What ? - Haley must be carrying something lethal . - Where 's Mulder ? - There 's no way he couldn 't catch him . - Mulder , respond . - Can you find him ? Zoom in . - I can 't see a thing . Mulder , suspect is armed and dangerous . Pursue alpha with extreme caution . Mulder . Damn . Agent Scully . Scully . - What happened ? - I lost him . - What do you mean ? - He got away . I came in early . I wanted to take a look at the surveillance tape to make sure I wasn 't crazy . What happened out there , Mulder ? What happened ? There were 12 agents yesterday in the park . We had ownership of the suspect . We were in position to make the capture and you let him get away . And from what I see now , you may have even aided in his escape . - I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . - It 's on the video . I can 't prove it was you , but I know what I saw . This man is a murderer . He is a terrorist . I have a report to give this morning . I expect you to give me an answer . I expect you to tell me the truth . We 're late for the hearing . 15 hours ago a joint FBI / CIA task force assembled to capture Jacob Steven Haley , second-in-command of the group known as New Spartans . Intelligence revealed Haley was to make an exchange of money for weapons to conduct domestic terrorist activities and to further their goal of overthrowing the federal government . Due to reasons that are still under review , our operation failed . Jacob Steven Haley remains at large , whereabouts unknown . What about the weapons ? An arms dealer , who died at the scene , received from Haley a $ 50,000 bearer bond . Presumably this was payment for weapons delivered . In other words , Haley not only got away , he got away with $ 50,000 worth of guns ? Have we determined a cause of death ? How Haley killed this man ? He was killed by means of a highly toxic biological agent . - What kind of toxin ? - We don 't know . Its effect on the dermis and the soft tissues , the rapidity of its action : it is not a disease known in nature . It would seem to be genetically engineered . - A bioweapon . - How the hell did he get it ? Former Soviet Union . Security on the Siberian vector lab is lax . It 's conceivable it was stolen . Though we have no confirmation from Moscow . So , is this in the ozone now ? Is this stuff floating through Folger Park ? Decontamination procedures were undertaken immediately . Our indications are that exposure was limited and that the toxin was transmitted directly and not contagious . - How do you know that ? - We 're not all dead . At this point we can only guess the toxin was transmitted by liquid , gas , touch or injection . Anybody care to tell me how this guy Haley eluded us ? Video recon indicates Haley had an accomplice at the park . We 've yet to identify who this was or how Haley knew he was under surveillance . - He must 've made us . - Could he have ? This task force was chosen for their lack of exposure in terrorist circles . Haley 's extremely suspicious to the point of paranoia . He 's got military training and a guerilla mentality . Second only to this man . August Bremmer . He 's the group 's mastermind . However , there are reports that he and Haley are vying for control . This destabilization makes August Bremmer our primary threat . Well , this is it . This is the scenario we 've all been worried about , people . Now , I need maximum control of information . Nothing leaves this room . The media gets a sniff , we 're gonna disavow . We are gonna stop these men . We 're gonna make it all go away . Mulder . - The show 's almost over . - One , please . Thanks . I 'd Iike some popcorn , please . Do you want large , extra large or jumbo large ? Could I get some fresh popcorn , please ? The sign says " fresh popcorn . " - This is fresh popcorn . - No , fresh fresh . Hot . Out of that machine back there . please . - A large . - I have to make it . Probably take a minute . - Yeah ? - You set me up . - I saved your ass . - Why wasn 't I told ? - I didn 't know about the operation . - It was your operation . The Justice Department got an anonymous tip . I found out about it half an hour before . I did what I could . - You 'II have to do better than that , Mulder . - I got as much to lose here as you do . They catch you , you 'II flip me . Look , I believe in your ideals and your goals . The only reason I tolerate your methods is because the government 's are worse . Wow . What a ringing endorsement . You came to me , remember ? What more do you want from me ? I 've risked everything . I 've given you information . My partner is seriously suspicious . If that 's not enough for you , that 's all I got . - Ain 't nobody home . - No , she 's in there . - She 's just hiding ' or somethin ' . - We could make a break for it . Right through the front doors . Why ? I got us front-row seats . She see us ? Is she coming ? Hey , man . - Maybe you can tell me what 's going on . - What ? There seems to be a problem . A man told me you gave him keys to my room . Room 130 . - Who are you ? - Who am I ? Who is he ? - Mr Kaplan . - Mr Kaplan ? - Yes . - Thank you . - Are you the wife ? - Not even close . Yeah ? We 'II proceed as planned . Agent Mulder , you comin ' with us ? Step out of the car . Exactly what agency are you guys from ? Obviously not the Office of Information . Agent Scully , take a seat . - What the hell is going on ? - I apologize for our methods . - They may have saved Agent Mulder 's life . - What about my Iife ? - I don 't appreciate being run off the road . - We had our reasons . You 're suspicious Mulder has betrayed his country . - I don 't know what you mean . - Your discretion is understandable . In point of fact , Agent Mulder 's actions are entirely honorable . What you 've stumbled into is a classified action : a deep-cover assignment . Until now , Mulder 's true mission was known only to us . - His true mission ? - The council we sat in was a front . To make the New Spartans believe we were unaware of his complicity . - Why him ? Why choose Agent Mulder ? - We didn 't choose him . They did . He spoke at a UFO conference in Boston , where he broadcast his feelings about the government and their conspiracies against the American people . Somebody from the organization heard him . The man who escaped , Haley , sent out feelers in hopes that Agent Mulder was a man whose politics were in line with his own . Someone on the inside that he could use . - To what aim ? - That , we don 't know . You 've put Mulder 's life in danger by not telling me . Agent Mulder came to me . I advised him not to tell you . He 's at a very delicate point . Everything he does now must work to build trust . Including letting this man Haley get away with murder ? Sir , we know nothing about this bioweapon . We don 't know what they want to use it for . We don 't even know if they have the capacity to store it safely . Putting Agent Mulder in this situation is extremely risky . They want something from him . We have no other way of learning what . Movie theater in Ohio . Whatever they 're usin ' , they 've used it again . Is this the Pepsi Challenge ? How about some fresh air , boys ? Welcome , Agent Mulder . OK , deal me in . This is just a Iittle method that we use to Iearn the truth . You might wanna put that hood back on me unless you wanna see a grown man cry . What happened in the park ? I told you on the phone . - I was set up . - I 'm tellin ' the truth . Wait . I let you go . - You 're spying on us , aren 't you ? - No . You want me to lie and say yes ? I 'm gonna kill you , you son of a bitch ! If I set you up , do you think I 'd even get into the car with this Nazi piece of sh ... ? I risked everything . If I was Iying , there 'd be federal agents descending on this place like the wrath of God right now . If you touch me again , you 'd better kill me . A war is going on , Agent Mulder . Either you 're on the right side , or the wrong . - You 've seen the effects of this . - Yeah . - Like to see them again ? - No . I didn 't set you up . If you got set up , it was one of yours . You know what ? I believe you . - What are you reading in there ? - No hot zones , no atmospheric . - You 're clear , Agent Scully . - Thank you . There 's 14 victims total , including patrons , a projectionist and an employee . That 's the usherette . There were two survivors . Two teenage boys . How does it happen that those two kids survived ? I don 't know . But it 's gonna help us establish a method of delivery . It 's doubtful the pathogen was airborne . They found no atmospheric traces . So it 's gotta be something that everybody touched . Don 't be alarmed . - Scully , get outta here . - Mulder ... I know what you 're doing . - Skinner told me everything . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - What happened to your hand ? - Nothing . Mulder , what did they do to you ? - This needs to be set . You 're in pain . - If you keep pullin ' it around like that ... Let 's get the swelling down . They 've killed again , Mulder . 14 people in a movie theater in Ohio . Same toxin they released in the park . 14 people ? - It doesn 't make any sense . - Unless it was a test . For something bigger . Why do this to you , Mulder ? They 're testing me , too . Haley 's paranoid and spooked . I was sure he was gonna kill me . - What stopped him ? - He still needs something from me . And I 'm sensing there 's someone Haley trusts even less . The man giving ' him his orders . Someone I haven 't met yet . A guy named August Bremmer . - What happened to your hand ? - Terrorist lie detector . - Well , did you pass ? - I must have . I 'm still here . They told me what they want . Documentation from the Federal Reserve Bank . Fund-transfer schedules for the eastern seaboard . Cash money . They 're gonna hit a bank or an armored car . That 's it ? That 's all ? I think I convinced Haley that the near miss in Folger Park was due to a mole in his group . - He wants surveillance files on them . - How soon ? - They 're waiting for my call . - We 'II need some time to redact . No , I anticipated this . I 've got files ready to use . I 'm gettin ' a bad feeling about this . I want a tail on him . - No tail . - Once they get what they want , - what 's to keep them from killing him ? - They spot a tail , they 're gonna shoot him . We have got no other way of learning what they want past this , what the big picture is . You may not have another chance to contact us . If you don 't hear from me by midnight , feed my fish . That 's it . That 's your bug . - That 's a bacterium . - An especially virulent one . We isolated it from the bearer bond . - Was the bacterium found on the ticket stub ? - Actually , no . Barring the usual particles and dust mites , the ticket stub was clean . How was the biotoxin spread throughout the theater ? I don 't know . - It looks like streptococcus . - A strain of streptococcus , but one that has been genetically altered to make it extraordinarily lethal . But strep wouldn 't be able to survive any exposure to the environment . Normally , but whoever produced this has cleverly coated the bacterium with a synthetic protective cover . The covering gives them an adhesive quality . It 's like scratch ' n ' sniff . Dermal contact activates the contagion . It 's ingenious , in its own evil way . Developed by the Russians ? I 've seen everything in their arsenal . They 've got nothing this sophisticated . Well , then , by whom ? - Do you have what we need ? - Tell the gimp to back off . Gimme the files . I need that back by tomorrow . Lies within lies . Put the hood on . You 're goin ' with us . No . You put it on or the gimp puts it on for you . - Skinner . - The biotoxin was applied to the bearer bond with an aerosol spray but there 's no evidence whatsoever of it on the theater stubs . Now , I still have no idea how these kids were unaffected . Have you ID 'd the toxin ? - Agent Scully ? - Sir , are you alone ? - No . Why ? - I 'd Iike to speak with you in private . You 're off the speaker . Now , CIA intelligence suggested that this biotoxin was stolen from the Russians . But my research indicates it was almost certainly developed domestically . The US has no bioweapons . President Nixon dismantled our program in 1969 . So we 've been told . But the CDC database contains evidence of a streptococcus bacterium being developed by the army 's Pine bluff facility in the 1960s . It appears to be a very primitive strain of what we 're seeing here . - What are you saying ? - What I 'm saying is ... that the bioweapons program may have continued in secret . And that someone may be sending Agent Mulder on a suicide mission . Right . Thank you . What is it ? She 's just concerned for her partner . You put us all at risk bringing him here . We took the usual precautions . Anyway , he came through for us . Federal Reserve schedules for tomorrow . - You 're a believer ? - I have my beliefs . - You willing to die for them ? - I 'd prefer it didn 't come to that . We have a job to do . You 're Dracula . Oh , damn . The money . Oh , my God . The money . Mulder , take it . Make sure you point that the right way . May I have the keys , please ? You do what I say or I 'II shoot you . Three minutes . Open the gate . Get down . Now . Everybody down . Don 't be foolish . Give us the money and we 'II be gone . Move back . Come on . Move it . AII right . Here . Down . Now . Don 't touch that phone . - Dracula , take the teller . - Right . Step away from the counter . Open the doors . Put your hands up on the windows . Now . Do it . You . Here . Get down . Now . - Nobody move . - Two minutes . Let 's open it . Don 't move . I got it . Oh , my God . Is he dead ? No . He 's still alive . Finish him . One minute thirty . You . Face down on the floor . Right here . Now . What are you waiting for ? Do it . Get down . I told you to finish him . That weapon 's traceable . Go . Get the hell outta here . Go . What are you doing ? The bills could be traced . The bank heist was a decoy . To contaminate the money you didn 't take . No more tests , Mr Mulder . This is the real deal . - You 've been a big help . - Put that down . - He 's a liability . - To who ? You ? If you 're gonna kill Mulder to protect your secret , it 's too late . I know your secret . Mulder provided us with FBI surveillance reports . Files which contained a name . A source who 's been leaking information on us for a period of two years . Charles Bogart . See , Bogart is an alias , an old one , for August Bremmer . Agent Mulder knows my alias . He knew a false report would feed your ambition and pit you against me . Mulder risked his life for us . Are you sure about that ? They 're testing me . Haley 's paranoid . Spooked . I was sure he was gonna kill me . - What stopped him ? - They need something from me . I 'm sensing there 's someone Haley trusts even less . What the hell is this ? Director Skinner , you 've got to get to Mulder . You 've gotta find the bank they hit . - We 're trying to . - Mulder 's life is in danger , and anybody else who touches the currency . They 're putting the biotoxin on the money . We 've got no way of contacting him . - Not without blowing his cover . - You 've got no choice . We had surveillance tapes satellited to us . There have been 27 robberies - in seven eastern states this morning . - There 's no sign of Mulder . Well , he 's gotta be on there somewhere . We 've made some decisions . Take it and get outta here . I don 't wanna see your face again . Go . - On your feet . - You can just call me a cab . That 'II be fine . - Let 's go . - Go where ? Witnessing the murder of a federal agent will make these men an accessory . - You hear that ? - I wouldn 't miss it for the world . Stop there . Down on your knees . Hands behind your back . There 's a car for you just over the rise . Head south till you get to the highway . - Who are you ? - Go on . They come out here and find us , they 'II kill us both . Go . Hold it . Who are you ? FBI . Who 's in charge ? I need everybody out of the bank . - Mulder . - They sprayed the money . We got here an hour ago , before any of the funds were touched . The cash supply 's being isolated . It 's being locked down in the vault . - How did you know it was this bank ? - I recognized you from the surveillance tape . Your finger . August Bremmer , or whatever his real name is , he 's working with us . Before you go on , you should know the biotoxin they used may have come from government labs . Our government . - I was set up ? - We have no definitive information - to justify that position . - I was being used ? This whole operation ? The people that died in that theater ? Agent Mulder . Our government is not in the business of killing innocent civilians . The hell they aren 't . Those were tests on us to be used on someone else . Those bills have been analyzed . The money in the vault gave no readings . There 's no evidence of any biotoxins . So before you climb on any bandwagon ... You knew about this all along . You knew about this the whole time . - I want the money rechecked . - It 's been cleared . It 's being used as evidence in a federal crime . That money 's as dirty as you are , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? Say that were true , then what do you hope to accomplish as a whistle-blower ? To mobilize a civil-rights action ? To bring down the federal government ? To do the very work that that group you were a part of is so bent on doing ? What do you want ? Laws against those men or laws protecting them ? I want people to know the truth . Sometimes our job is to protect those people from knowing it . Excuse me . Visiontext Subtitles : Kerrie SIavin US ENGLISH

 [ Woman Over P.A. ] Attention , ladies and gentlemen . We are now on final approach to our destination port of Saint Lowel , the largest city on Mars . We hope you had a pleasant flight . Today 's temperature is a cool 11 degrees Celsius . The oxygen percentage reading is seven percent . Reports have come in of slight unrest throughout the city ... due to public demonstrations . We hope you have an enjoyable time during your stay on Mars . Thank you . [ Panting , Groaning ] No ! Jennifer ! [ Grunting ] [ Woman Over P.A. ] Please remain seated and keep your seat belts fastened ... until we 've come to a full stop . We wish to thank our passengers for their patronage . We look forward to servicing you in the future . Have a nice day . [ Whirring ] [ Beeping ] - Hmm ? - [ Beeping ] The cargo area ? [ Beeping Continues ] Huh ? [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] - [ Gunshots ] - [ Screaming , Grunting ] Make sure your units are covering the rooftop and the rear . [ Tires Screeching ] All in a day 's work , Lieutenant . And don 't try and bill me for that bike . [ Chattering ] [ Sighs ] [ Grunts ] Hey , watch out . Hmm ? Freeze ! Get your hands up ! I said , " Get your hands up ! " Now ! - What 's up ? - Detective , you 'd better stay back . Handle it . Get back ! - [ Screaming ] - [ Grunting ] [ Gunshot ] - Tell me you 're packin ' your gun , Sheriff . - [ Grunts ] - How about you ? - Oh , uh-uh . A bunch of cowboys up the ass , and not one of them 's got a gun . [ People Screaming ] Stop now ! [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] [ Screams ] [ Grunting ] Let me down ! Let me down ! - Look ! That bastard 's getting away ! - What the hell ? - No ! - Stay out of this , Detective . - [ Grunts ] - [ Screaming ] This is the Martian Police Department , Detective Sylibus . - Did you have a nice trip ? - [ Gunshot ] [ Woman Screaming ] No ! - [ Sobbing ] - It 's McCanon ! He killed her ! [ Shouting ] The country singer ? Ha-ha ! [ Yelling ] [ Glass Shattering ] [ Panting ] Damn it ! - Huh ? - [ Engine Revving ] Hey , wait ! What the hell are you doing ? You damn lunatic ! This is insane . [ People Chattering , Groaning , Coughing ] [ Man ] Where did you go ? I was so worried about you ? [ Crying ] [ Crying Continues ] Her name was Kelly McCanon . She was a famous country singer . In fact , the only country singer in the universe . I guess this means they 're extinct . - And the suspect ? - I dunno . Tell me , is that crazy getup you 're wearing ... a standard issue Martian police uniform ? [ Giggles ] ' Course not . - So , what 's your name ? - The name 's Armitage . Ooh , what a sexy back . - I love broad shoulders . - Hey ! [ Grunts ] What was that for ? I was just being nice ! Listen . What 's going on here ? Is this somebody 's idea of a sick joke ? Annie Oakley here isn 't even human . Uh ? It 's a damn robot . What 's wrong ? What 's going on ? Spaceport police . This is their jurisdiction . [ Man ] In response to the Kelly McCanon incident , the Martian Police Department has created T.C.S. , Technological Criminal SWAT , to investigate . Lieutenant Randolph of the M.P.D. declined further details . [ Beeping ] The million-dollar question is : Just what do we have here , a woman or a robot ? Sir , results from my preliminary findings ... are , well , uh , very interesting . I learned that the , uh , victim ... shall we call her ... is not a human nor a cyborg . After examining the body , I concluded she was entirely a robot . Her body tissue was of man-made organic origin , and she functioned through artificial intelligence . While no one is capable of creating a human brain ... yet , her computer brain was very sophisticated . And , as I mentioned , her physical construction was created organically , but it was done using a technology much more advanced than the Second series models . I believe that the victim was a prototype built outside of regulations . It could also , uh , mean that there are other illegal models like her ... running around under our noses . Yes , thank you . And now Detective Sylibus will give his report about the scene . I ... I am Ross Sylibus from the Chicago Police Department . [ Yawning ] - [ Yawning Continues ] - [ Sighs ] Uh , the suspects appeared ... I mean , they seemed like they wanted to transport the body ... without anyone noticing . Um , probably to finish their work somewhere else in private . Officer Armitage there had been trailing the suspects ... and then all hell broke loose . Armitage , can you fill us in ? Well , I trailed the suspects ... and saw they were equipped . I didn 't think they were carrying a dead robot . So , what the hell does that mean ? That it was McCanon 's impostor riding the shuttle ? - Shut up , Eddie ! - Hmm . [ Randolph ] What did her manager have to say ? Well , sir , according to him , he didn 't see any difference ... between the woman he sat with and the real country-western singer . And nobody saw her come out of the arriving terminal . The only suspicious passenger he saw was Detective Sylibus . It seems that the trick for us is to find out where the real McCanon is . You know , maybe she 's feeling her wild oats . Might 've found herself some kind of wild lover . Christ , Eddie , will you zip it ? - Just how was she acting inside the shuttle ? - She acted fine . She was holding a normal conversation . Nothing seemed unusual about it to me . Hell , I wouldn 't have been able to tell her apart from a human . [ Eddie ] Uh-huh . Uh ... [ Clears Throat ] Are you telling us that this robot was really McCanon ? You think that prima donna was a machine from the beginning ? No . I 'm saying you can 't distinguish it from a human being . Oh , hey , yeah , Armitage . When you realized the corpse was a robot , you seemed shocked , even upset . Did you think something was wrong ? Well , did ya ? No , sir . [ Gum Pops ] I hope you like your new place . It 's probably not as nice as you 're used to , but there 's a housing shortage here . Besides , the rent is reasonable on this end of town . Gee , a regular Park Avenue . Hmm . Whoa ! [ Elevator 's Voice ] Twelfth floor . [ Armitage ] I 'm sure it 's better when you get inside . Hmm . Ugh , it smells stale . Hey , is that all your luggage ? Well , you know , with all the excitement at the baggage claim today ... just as well . Probably stuff I wouldn 't have needed anyway . There 's enough trash from Earth here already . Well , you do have a point about that . - [ Country ] - Oh , look at this . [ Announcer ] This is a tape sent by the suspect ... of yesterday 's Saint Lowel spaceport shooting . Here where we belong What is this , some kind of memorial program ? Where we belong [ Announcer ] The following scenes contain graphic content ... and viewer discretion is advised . If you have children , please set your monitor to " L. " Hey , that 's the guy . I 'll go take care of the baggage , babe . All right . Hurry back . Who are you ? [ Screams ] [ Moaning ] What are you doing ? Leave me alone . Somebody help me , please . [ Moaning ] [ Moaning Continues ] Oh , no , don 't . How did you know I was a ... [ Screaming ] - [ Gunfire ] - My God . [ Groaning , Voice Synthesizer Warbling ] Jessica . [ Moaning ] This has been unedited material from video files ... as sent to us by the murder suspect . Here to comment on the footage is Ms. Julia Blanchen , an activist in the movement to drive out robots . [ Panting ] [ Grunting ] It 's amazing . They 're everywhere you look . You think they could build something else . [ Yawning ] You 're here pretty early , Detective . Hmm ? [ Grunts ] She 's gone already , the badge-toting terror in hot pants . [ Grunting ] Huh ? Hey , you want some free advice ? Try not to get your partner killed this time . And here 's one more thing . When she puts on her visor ... Whoo , watch out . Oh , and before I forget , here . She 's clean , gassed and waitin ' downstairs . And welcome to your new home . [ Chuckles , Grunts ] [ People Shouting ] [ Man ] Robots , get out ! - [ Shouting ] - Get out right now ! [ Crowd Shouting ] - [ Man ] Give us back our jobs ! - [ Crowd ] Give us back our jobs ! [ Beeping ] [ Lt. Randolph ] I 'm sorry to have to break you in so soon , so we may as well get started . [ Sylibus ] But , Lieutenant , is our section supposed to handle this matter ? Hmm ? Just what do you mean by that , Ross ? Well , you see , the victim was definitely a robot , so I don 't see why M.P.D. should get stuck dealing with it . Shouldn 't we let some other government agency take it off our hands ? I wish it was that easy , but it 's the robot 's origins ... that we 're interested in finding out about . As you may not be aware , people here consider illegal robot technology ... and replication to be a criminal offense . Yes , sir . I guess so . Are you going to tell me why you wanted to transfer to Mars ? Well , I 'd rather not , sir . As you like , but let me warn you . If you have misguided compassion for robots , you won 't make it here . - [ Crowd Shouting ] - [ Man ] Robots , get out ! - [ Shouting Continues ] - Get out right now ! Do you hear us ? We want our jobs . [ Chattering ] [ Beeping ] Wow , what a place . - Uh , excuse me , miss . Huh ? - Why not ? I 'm very sorry , but I 've explained to you ... that I cannot allow you to see him . You 're telling me he doesn 't remember the name " Armitage " at all ? - Mr. Asakura said he 's never heard of you . - Listen ! [ Armitage ] Don 't mess with me ! You 'd better get out of here , or I 'll call the security gadget . Yeah , I guess it 's useless talking to a Second like you . Hey ! [ Grunts ] - Whoa ! Ugh ! - Uh , just cancel that appointment . Robots , get out ! Robots , get out now ! Robots , get out ! - Robots , get out now ! - [ Crowd Shouting ] I can 't believe this . Put me down right now ! [ Grunting ] What the hell were you trying to accomplish back there ? [ Man ] Robots , get out now ! You know , you really should move your car . It might get trashed . - By those idiots . - Huh ? So , now what 's next ? Hmm ? Well , immigration seems like a likely place . Oh , Ross . I already went there and couldn 't find our guy on the list . Hmm . Oh , I doubt we 'll find any record of him , because 37 percent of the population isn 't registered here . Or I guess you didn 't know that . So who the hell were you trying to see at the Conception Company ? That is private . By the way , I 've already done some legwork . Conception was the company that set the standards for the Seconds . So , there you go . Uh , but , you know , I still pity ' em . The other manufacturer , Hugite , passed them up , and it killed their aspirations , but that 's the way it always goes . Say , does this fancy machine have reclining seats ? Huh , partner ? If you 're looking for a partner , then stop flying solo . [ Sighs , Giggles ] Hey , Ross , as your partner , can I make a suggestion ? Yeah . - Let 's eat . I 'm starving . - All right . Huh ? Ooh . - Ice cream . - Junk food . [ Sighs ] I thought we were gonna get something to eat . Oh , well , whatever . This is some kind of town . Things are just gonna get worse with all these remodeled Seconds . There 's no way humans and robots are ever gonna get along . Besides , you can 't trust robots . - You 're no different . - Hmm ? You and that guy are both the same . What do you mean , that nutcase ? It just seems that both of you have something against robots . Well , I 'm sick of all these cyborgs and humanoids and machines ... that only seem to copy us . Since I 'm allowed to make a choice , I choose not to like something that pretends to be human . [ Armitage Scoffs ] [ Scoffs ] Now , you 're positive that that woman on the shuttle with you ... was Kelly McCanon ? - Well ? - Of course I 'm sure . Excuse me ? Oh , please tell me you 've found Kelly , won 't you , huh ? No stinkin ' robot can play a guitar and sing the way Kelly does . I 'm her manager . I know her better than anybody . She 's the most human woman I know . [ Grunts ] - [ Gasping , Grunting ] - Armitage ! [ Groaning ] Your client is history , buddy . Just learn to live with it . Hey , wait ! Hey , wait up ! Armitage ! I want to go . Your conduct was hardly professional . Sorry , but that whiner was nothing but an asshole . You can sympathize with him , but I don 't . Hmm . That jerk can 't figure out how a robot ... could possibly be as good as his precious human star . [ Sighs ] Don 't you understand ? All of McCanon 's talents , personality and dreams were inside that machine . Oh , my God . Yeah , what is it ? I didn 't realize . - [ Beeping ] - Huh . Sylibus here . Uh , it 's Chris . I 'm receiving a weird voice mail transmission . - Is Armitage with you ? - Uh ... No , I 'm afraid I don 't see her right now . It 's coming to us in real time , so I 'll transmit it to your mailbox . Log it and show it to Armitage right away . [ Woman ] I told you , an officer named Armitage . [ Man ] Okay , okay , lady . We 're looking for her right now . Please , you 've got to help me . I 'm a Third ! [ Man ] What 's your name again ? Wait . Let me get a pen . - All right , go ahead . - Manning . It 's Jessica Manning . I 'm keeping a list of all the Thirds from Pluto . I can 't go outside because of the protests , and the man on TV who killed that singer has been sending me mail ! Something 's gonna happen unless you help me ! Who are you ? [ Screams ] Huh ? [ Screams ] Huh . Why are they all females ? [ Gasps ] [ Screams ] TV piracy is a felony , pal . You could get eight years of hard labor in prison . - Who the hell are you ? Huh ? - I 'm Rene D 'Anclaude . It 's my name . [ Man ] So just who do you think you are , mister ? There are other things to concern yourselves with . Let me show you . [ Clears Throat ] Robots are disguising themselves as humans . Am I wrong ? It 's my duty to do something about this . You must be rid of those so-called Thirds . First contestant . This is Jessica Manning . - Shit . - A snobbish , bourgeois artist ... who lives and works right here among you . She had you all fooled . [ Chuckles ] What should we do about her ? [ Laughing ] [ Gasps ] [ Woman Crying ] [ Crying Continues ] [ Crying ] Hey , are you okay ? Where 's Miss Manning ? Jessica ! Save her , please ! Why ? [ Sobbing ] It 's all right . You just wait here . - [ Shouting ] - [ Man ] Robots , get out ! [ Shouting Continues ] Let me through ! Police ! Hey ! [ Man ] Give us back our jobs . [ Shouting Continues ] - [ Man ] Get out right now ! - Huh ? [ Crying , Gasping ] [ Gasps , Moans ] It 's them . The list of Thirds . Yes . And then ? No , wait ! [ Beeping ] Good-bye , Jessica . [ Grunts ] Huh ? [ Whooping ] [ Whooping Continues ] [ Bell Tolling The Hour ] - [ Gunshots ] - [ Cackling ] - Slow down ! - Ah ! [ Grunting ] [ Gunshot ] You , of all people , should understand my work . After all , didn 't a cyborg kill your partner ? They 're a pestilence . [ Grunts ] Hmm ? But your leg . [ Grunting ] Hey , sailor , what 's this ? - [ Grunting ] - [ Laughing ] You 've gotta be kidding . A fake leg ? Surely the ironic humor of this hasn 't escaped you . [ Chuckling ] You 're almost a stinking cyborg yourself , you freak . - [ Bell Tolling ] - Huh ? [ Bell Continues Tolling ] What 's that ? Huh ? It 's you . Until now , you 've never witnessed the true power of a Third . Allow me to demonstrate . [ Coughing ] [ Cackling ] Here , bitch ! Burn , you misfit ! - [ Yells ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Grunting ] - [ Panting ] - [ Yells ] - [ Screams ] [ Gagging ] [ Gagging Continues ] - [ Grunts ] - You monster . - Ah ! - [ Weapon Clanging ] Yeah , that 's right . I 'm a monster . Just another name for a Third in your book . What are you gonna do , destroy me ? Why ? What did we ever do to humans ? If humans don 't want me , then why did they create me ? [ Crying ] Don 't do it ! Just cuff him ! You 're a police officer first , Armitage , and you know what your duty is . Armitage , it doesn 't matter that you 're a Third . You 're a cop , and you 're my partner . [ Crying ] [ Crying Continues ] No , don 't look at me . [ Crying Continues ] You 'd already figured out that I wasn 't a human , didn 't you ? I feel like some kind of grotesque puppet . I can walk and talk ... and I can laugh and I can cry . But I 'm only a monstrous doll . - No ! - [ Water Splashing ] [ Lt. Randolph ] Armitage carries a special A-class license . - [ Sylibus ] I know . - But she chose to become a cop . A good one . You understand what I 'm getting at ? Yeah . The reason she disappeared is because of you , Ross . Lieutenant Randolph , you can interrogate me all you want . I 'm used to it . Ross , that won 't be necessary . If you say you don 't know anything , that 's good enough for me ... and leave it at that . I 'm no Sherlock Holmes , but I 've learned from experience to follow my instinct . I have a hunch there 's some kind of connection ... between Armitage and the killing of the Third types . [ Chuckles ] This could get real fun . If an officer is rumored to be a humanoid , the shit could hit the fan , so let 's keep this between you , me and the wall . [ Thinking ] Armitage isn 't a good cop . She 's a great one . [ Groaning ] Always hurts like hell when the rain comes . Hmm ? - Start message . - [ Beeps ] Hey , where are you ? Are you okay ? [ Chuckles ] Your partner 's concerned . Lieutenant Randolph 's no dummy . He suspects you 're a Third . It appears D 'Anclaude is working with someone , because Thirds are still being murdered . Armitage , don 't let bitterness change you . Come back , please . This makes number seven . Oh , God , I think I 'm gonna puke . [ Sylibus ] Who the hell is doing this ? I can only think of two people with the means and motivation . Hmm ? I 'm talking about Rene D 'Anclaude and Armitage . - What 's that ? - Yeah , I know . It 's weird to think about , but she talked to me about it once . She pities the robots used for crime , so she kills them quickly . But I can 't believe she 'd actually ... Not on your life . Sure , the village is artsy , but downtown is a pit . I wouldn 't move there for anything . I 've got to get some writing done . I 'll talk to you later . Continue writing mode . Novel in progress : untitled . Chapter two , paragraph five . [ Clears Throat ] How could she greet the ones from the deep far away ? She , who has spent a pleasant and enchanting afternoon , who had never given a thought about the person from the Louis . The same one who once picked her up now cold and dead . A phantom . - [ Door Closes ] - Her battle with the old gods ended . As a spiritual truce was struck , she felt her soul unburdened . She smiled . Already , the feeling of harmony was ... [ Gasps ] Who 's there ? Who are you ? Are you Armitage ? - Are you the one who contacted me ? - [ Beeping ] You fooled me . [ Gasps ] [ Groaning ] [ Groaning ] I don 't wanna die . I don 't wan ... Do you mean that Armitage is a suspect ? Well , you can 't just deny the evidence . The woman 's last words said it all . The whole department is shocked , but the lieutenant had suspicions about her all along . He 's already issued a warrant for her arrest , and there 's an A.P.B. out on her . Why that sly old dog . Access mail . Log file : Armitage . Open file . [ Beeping ] This is Pluto . It 's Pluto . I 'm sending this message by use of Armitage 's I.D. I 'm a Third , just like you and all the others . Hey , Chris . - Find out where this mail originated from . - You got it . - [ Laughter ] - Wanna see a movie Saturday ? Hey , I was worried about you . I used to love the playground after school . I was a pretty clumsy kid , though . I took a tumble off the seesaw once and bawled all the way home . Listen , did you know that M.P.D. has been searching for you ? But you 're looking for Pluto , right ? Let 's go . - Armitage ? - [ Giggling ] What ? I believe in you . - There ! That 's him . I 'm sure of it . - Huh ? [ Sylibus ] But he 's a boy . [ Armitage ] How do you do , Pluto ? It 's nice to meet you . Please don 't call me by my handle again . You can use my given name : Julian Moore . [ Giggling ] I 'm sorry . By the way , shouldn 't you be in class ? No . I 'm transferring my thoughts to the main memory at the navigation center . - Hmm ? What for ? - What for ? [ Sighs ] To make a backup of myself , obviously . - Well , let 's go . - Huh ? Where ? To the memory server at the ad tower , of course . You wanna learn the purpose of the Thirds ? [ Sylibus ] I can 't believe it . You 're a Third ? [ Pluto ] Yes , I 'm a Third . The last one made . [ Gasps ] What 's wrong ? - [ Armitage ] Why 'd the elevator stop - I don 't know . [ Beeping ] Huh ? [ Groaning ] [ Grunting ] it won 't stop . We 're dropping pretty fast . At this rate , we 're gonna die for sure . Ross , hold on tight to him . - Do you really think this is gonna work ? - You got any ideas ? - [ Grunting ] - [ Beeping ] [ Screaming , Groaning ] [ Groaning Continues ] Ross ? [ Grunting ] I think my right arm and ribs are broken . [ Coughing ] [ Gasping ] Huh ? Armitage , don 't get any closer ! [ Gasps ] Damn you . He 's fast . Come on ! We gotta run for it ! - Go on . Leave me here . - No ! I 'll help you . Let 's go ! - [ Sylibus Grunting ] - [ Armitage Panting ] - Oh , my God . - [ Metal Scraping ] [ Gasps ] Ross . It looks like the only choice is to fight . [ Grunting ] [ Screaming , Coughing ] [ Gasping , Groaning ] [ Yells ] [ Grunting ] [ Gasping ] Move out ! If Armitage is killed , then there 's gonna be no hope for me . - Oh . - [ Cackling ] - [ Gasping , Coughing ] - [ Cackling Continues ] It 's D 'Anclaude . I just don 't believe it . [ Cackling ] Surprise , surprise . Did you miss me ? You son of a bitch ! [ Grunting ] - [ Gasps ] Oh ! - [ Cackling ] I won 't let you die alone , cheri . The other two will join you . - Fucking bastard ! - [ Screaming ] He 's not human . Nice right hook , but now I 'm going to crush the three of you and get on with my life . I have places to go and robots to kill . Huh ? - [ Screeching ] - Huh ? What the ... - Hi there . Bon voyage , Rene . - [ Gasping ] You crazy bitch ! Give me the keys ! - Please , unlock it . [ Gasping ] - Bye-bye . [ Screaming ] I 'm curious . Why aren 't other Thirds as strong as you ? Security should be here any minute . I 'm sure they 'll take care of you . No , you don 't have to run and hide now . Officers don 't leave their injured behind . You 're cold , lady . [ Coughing ] Huh ? I will always be cold . [ Groaning ] Armitage . [ Machines Beeping ] I 'm amazed he survived with all the injuries he sustained . His entire chest area was damaged , and the right arm was severed . Over 50 percent of his body will be artificial replacement parts . Isn 't that gonna be a problem for a policeman ? For a recruit , maybe , but not for this cowboy . [ Grunting ] - Huh ? - [ Chuckling ] I hope you feel better than you look . I can 't understand why my other arm hurts so much . The doctor threw in some kind of new nervous system for you , so it 's probably just a side effect . At any rate , there 's something I wanna show you . It 's Kelly McCanon . Why haven 't they disposed of her body yet ? Hey , she 's a real find . You just don 't throw something like her away . Except for a few functions , Thirds are perfect synthetic organisms . They can simulate every physical aspect of the human body . The big mystery that 's had everybody running in circles is : Why have all the Thirds been female ? Do you know ? After the victims were autopsied , we discovered that this wasn 't just a case of robot destruction . It was murder . I 'll show ya . Our country-western singer ? She was pregnant . No stinking robot can play a guitar and sing the way Kelly does . I 'm her manager . I know her better than anybody . She 's the most human woman I know . I can 't believe I 'm capable of giving birth . Quite a revelation , isn 't it ? That 's the whole purpose of the Third types . You can step beyond the bounds of conventional robots ... just by getting pregnant , Mommy Armitage . Hmm . Not funny . It 's too weird . But you , what 's your role ? I 'm still trying to figure that out . What 's the point in creating a male kid ? The C.P.U. showed my serial number ... as the last Third made . The final model off the line . Not quite . We can breed now . Now I understand why the Thirds were made to seem so human , not just in appearance but emotionally , like the murdered singer and that novelist . They weren 't just machines . They had souls . It takes more than the right plumbing to procreate . Yes , sir . The perfect receptacle for human babies . - [ Chuckles ] - What the hell 's so funny , huh ? - Jerk . - Tsk-tsk . What 's the matter ? Have I touched a nerve ? Maternal clock ticking ? Maybe you 'd like Detective Ross to set your alarm . - [ Laughing ] - Shut up ! I was just kidding . Julian , do you know why they made us ? I don 't , but I 'll bet Asakura does . Or D 'Anclaude . He must have some part in this . How are you feeling ? Have you made a full recovery ? Yeah , I 'm fine . It takes time getting used to these new body parts . - Ironic , isn 't it ? - What ? Little by little , you 're becoming like the robot you hate so much . Let 's get down to business , shall we ? Why is the investigation of the Thirds over ? That doesn 't make sense . - Maybe it does . - Bullshit . But we have to follow orders in this department . - Tell me , was the decision forced ? - I 'll tell you what it is . It 's a goddamned order that you 're gonna follow . The Third investigation is over because the murderer was apprehended . Even after we 've discovered that Thirds are robots that can actually conceive . Why stop here ? - D 'Anclaude 's under full guard . - Yeah , right . He 's over at Shenora General Government Hospital . I can 't accept the contradictory report that you filed . But , sir ! Our job is to investigate and arrest technological criminals . Don 't you forget it . That 's all I have to say for now . [ Lt. Randolph 's Voice ] ironic , isn 't it ? Little by little , you 're becoming like the robot you hate so much . [ Distant Sirens Wailing ] That 's where all my memory was backed up and stored . I 'm saved for posterity . - And if we 're all murdered , you know ... - Will you give it a rest ? [ Chuckles , Mumbles ] [ Beeping ] Ha ! Bingo ! - [ Beeping ] - Hmm ? Warning : Only authorized personnel are permitted within the memory bank . - Oh . - Please vacate this area at once . We 're lost . Which way is magnetic north ? There is no department by that name . You must vacate within ten seconds or ... - [ Grunts ] - [ Whistles ] Asakura was quite a designer . He created the ultimate woman who could kick ass and raise children . He designed you too . [ Giggles ] Yeah , but I can 't get pregnant . Hmm . That 's it . [ Grunts ] Hmm . Hmm . Here goes . I hate that this is the easiest way . [ Groaning ] Hey , will you hurry up ? Hey , I 'm doing this for you . It hurts like hell , so shut up . I need to know about myself . Who am I and why ? Hmm . I 'll look . I 'm searching for Asakura 's file . - Armitage ? - Huh ? Help me out . My virtual monitor . - Yeah ? - Open it from my navigational system . - [ Beeping ] - [ Gasping ] Good . I 've located the still image file . Hold on . Just another second . [ Gasping ] That 's my father , but why is he standing next to D 'Anclaude ? I don 't believe it . [ Moaning ] Julian ! [ Groaning ] Damn it ! I think someone 's discovered me . You 're logging off now ! [ Gasping ] [ Moaning ] Oh , God . Something 's in me . [ Groaning ] Please help me . [ Moaning ] [ Cackling ] [ D 'Anclaude 's Voice ] Little Naomi Armitage ... went looking for knowledge and only found trouble . You can 't stop the Third types from being killed , my dear . [ Julian Screaming ] Shoot me . I don 't mind . [ Laughing ] Pull the trigger . I dare you . [ Laughing Continues ] So , you 're not a human . Are you a Third type ? You won 't find my name in the membership of that club for failures . What are you saying ? You make me wretch . Cheap imitations pretending to be human . There 's no comparison to our superiority . I couldn 't agree with humans more on one thing . All Thirds should be annihilated . [ Cackling ] I 'll kill you ! [ Screaming ] [ Moaning ] Julian . No . [ Panting ] That bastard 's not the original . - Oh , my God . - [ Groaning ] What 's wrong ? I 'm going . I 'll finally meet the real D 'Anclaude . Get back ! [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] A-Armitage , good-bye . Oh , no , Julian . No ! [ Screaming ] - Hey , R-Ross . - Huh ? - Ross ! - No . Ross , I need your help . [ Echoing ] it 's D 'Anclaude again . Please . I need you . Something happened to Julian . We need you . Ross , don 't ... So one of my men got a little carried away . Hmm , well ... I 'm Judicial Vice Minister Jessup , and I 'm visiting as a representative of the Legal Affairs Bureau . I need an accurate picture of the M.P.D. ' s operations . I 'm just a bit confused . Help me to understand why an inspector ... from Earth 's government has come here , hmm ? Oh , don 't mind me , Lieutenant . I 'm simply an observer for Mr. Jessup . Think of me merely as a fly on the wall . [ Groans ] Well , since you 're observing , I 'm sure you 've noticed ... that the robots here on Mars don 't quite reflect a feminist society . Very well . You understand us , uh , Mr. , uh , Randolph . Let 's call it a day and have lunch . [ Gasps ] [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Grunting ] [ Beeping Fades ] I 'm sick of the whole damn system . Armitage , didn 't Julian say he had his memory backup stored somewhere ? - The backup ? - That 's right . If we can somehow access his data , we could still bring him back . Get it ? His body 's gone , but his mind 's alive . Funny , I didn 't think I would miss him so much . Maybe his information will help us and avenge his death as well . Julian said he was gonna meet the real D 'Anclaude . Maybe he was telling us we could do the same . - Ross ? - Shenora , right ? Will you come with me ? [ Beeping ] - What 's up ? - The internal troops are active . - Are we at war ? - No . - They 're guarding . - What , the president ? - No , Shenora Hospital . - Shenora ? Jesus H. Christ , will you look at that arsenal ? What the hell are they doing there ? Hold on a minute . I 'm picking up something . What is it ? Ah , it 's just a car . Huh ? [ Gasps ] Holy shit . [ Clanging ] They 've lost it . Fire ! [ Grunting ] Here . [ Gasps ] [ Gasps ] it 's him . [ Sylibus ] Finally , the real D 'Anclaude . Or should I say Dr. Rene D 'Anclaude ? [ Moaning ] You must be ... Asakura 's daughter , the failure . - [ Grunting ] - [ Moaning ] We gotta hurry . Come on . Let 's go while we still can . - [ Squeaking ] - What 's the matter ? - [ Squeaking Continues ] - Ross . - Something 's coming . - What is it ? [ Glass Shattering ] [ Cackling ] - Not again . - D 'Anclaude . There 's no way . [ Cackling ] Hey , let 's rumba . Over here ! This way ! Hurry ! [ Grunting , Panting ] Wait ! Don 't run off ! I wanna play with you ! [ Panting ] [ Cackling ] Come on . Wait . There 's no way that damn gargoyle 's a Third type . Hmm ? My , look who 's talking ? Don 't tell me you have no clue who your brother was . You have more in common with that prototype gargoyle than you might realize . - Did you truly believe you were a Third ? - Liar . You can always ask Asakura , but he 's tucked away safely ... in a dome on Dunwich Hill . - [ Panting ] - Armitage . - Don 't stop . - No ! Oh , no . I can always tell when you 're gonna do something crazy . Hi , kids . Oh , does she want a showdown ? We 'll both go down fighting . That 'll make everyone happy , ' cause you know , nobody on Mars wants us here . Wrong ! You 're the one who 's through . - No ! - [ Grunting ] - [ Cackling ] - [ Grunting ] - No ! - [ Screaming ] Human suffering is such a unique privilege , isn 't it ? He 's pure data ! Cease function ! [ Screaming ] Next in the news : the Martian Police Department is investigating ... the terrorist attack at Shenora General Government Hospital , which occurred during an anti-robot demonstration . The police are asking for our viewers help in locating these two suspects : Ross Sylibus and Naomi Armitage . The M.P.D. confirms there is a definite connection . If you have any information , please notify the police . Yuck . [ Whistling ] Let me pick out our next meeting place , okay ? Tables with umbrellas . If that makes you too sick , I know a vending machine and a clean bench . I guess maybe this is the worst place . Worst place ? Only if I was in your shoes . Will you cut the crap ? Did you find anything ? Hmm , yeah . Your Dunwich Hill exists , but not on any map . I found a good highway going smack blank into a mountain , but no Asakura address box inviting any mail from a rogue cop . No topographicals ? Come on . Like I really got a couple of moons to power this thing . - Hey , what are you doing ? - A loss on duty . Yeah , the dearly departed . Hey , Ross ! Can you tell those guys ... the Martians ... Tell ' em Eddie says , " What 's up ? " Sure . [ Car Stereo Playing ] [ Sylibus ] So , what 's wrong ? Well , are you gonna tell me ? Are you okay ? No , I 'm not . My C.P.U. ' s all messed up . They say the mind 's the first thing to go . Humans say . Come on , Armitage . Machines don 't go senile . They also say life is pretty short . It 's like an expiration date , you know ? - Hey , how come ... - What ? What 's the reason you 're doing all of this for me , huh ? How come you 're still with me and driving me all the way out here anyway ? I mean , why change from a good cop to a criminal ? - Hmm . - How come ... Stop it ! You 're asking stupid questions like some little kid . Why ? How come ? There 's no answer . [ Gasps ] [ Grunts ] [ Armitage ] That 's it , isn 't it ? - Coordinates . - [ Beeping ] " Virgin " ? Yeah , maybe if you just landed here . Hey , it wastes fuel to keep the motor running . [ Grunting ] [ Birds Chirping ] [ Sylibus ] Yo ! Anybody here ? We 're looking for a guy called Asakura ! Is anyone here ? You got visitors ! - Oh . - What happened ? All right , take it easy . Move away from it nice and slow . Don 't shoot . It 's only a robot . Yeah , a big one . It 's somehow just like me . I think it 's a bioroid type . Is it some kind of prototype ? - May I help you ? - Huh ? [ Gasps , Grunts ] - Talk about your family trees . - It 's another D 'Anclaude . That same face and voice . I heard someone calling for Dr. Asakura . - [ Grunts ] - I did . Appointment ? No , I suppose not . Would you follow me , please ? - Dr. Asakura , visitors . A Mr ... - Sylibus . Papa ? Ah , the new man from Conception . It 's been so many years , and you even brought one of the models along . Mr. Sylibus . - Uh , but I 'm not ... - Papa . Oh , but she 's only a Third . She 's so inferior . The poor little thing . But you needn 't be so kind . It 's outdated . Oh , I 'm sorry . Here . Take a look at this . A Fourth type that Conception can be proud of . There 's no longer any need to copy humans or plants anymore . They live . They 're alives . Oh , no , we should call them " phobians . " What ? Yes , a new life , my Marforteans , but you won 't . You 'll just be calling them anything you want when you market them . The stupid company you work for ... is just going to call them " the Fourths , " aren 't they ? They 're alives . A grand conception . Then it all goes wrong . [ Grunting ] The doctor 's mind was unfortunately altered . Reduplication of his thoughts is very difficult . Please , be patient . - His memory , was it erased ? - Who are you ? I am Wilbur D 'Anclaude ... and Dr. Asakura 's aide . Oh , well , yeah , he might look to you like ... he 's one of those damn " assassinroids . " But I fixed up his crazy head , just as you can see . Indeed he did . The violent tendencies I had are now gone due to the upgrade . - [ Sylibus ] What 's the reason ? - Pardon ? Dr. Asakura , his mind . Just what 's wrong with it ? Forget it , Ross . That 's enough . Are you still cold ? Yes , it 's affecting my nervous system . I 'm sorry I lost my temper . I was ... just hoping the doctor would be able to help you somehow . Never count on hope . You 'll lose . When wishes are gone , hope gives nothing . And then you hope that your father might know , and hopes are really fragile . They get all ruined every time you believe ... that somebody else is gonna help your hopes come true . [ Crying ] A hope is a feeling . Maybe you 'll be okay . If I was a Second , then I wouldn 't even be able to think of all this stupid crap . But I 'm programmed to be a human , and I don 't even know what that means . Hope is a human feeling , isn 't it , Ross ? - Come on . Tell me more . - Hey , I know one . He 's a human , and he 's less real ... than all of the things you 're talking about . You wanna know what he said ? " Don 't give up . " Oh , Ross . Are you sure ? Armitage , I think it 's the only thing I 've been sure of since I got here . How about you ? Well , at least something is normal here on Mars . But I 'm not normal . I 'm a robot . I 'm half robot too , but I know a true heart when I 've met one . [ Man ♪ 1 ] We interrupt this broadcast for the following announcement . [ Man ♪ 2 ] Good evening : We 've just received word that , as of 11 : 00 p.m. U.T.N. time , the economic agreement has been signed at last . Mars and Earth have finally signed the treaty . Officials from both powers are quoted as saying : " This is a first step toward one world , one nation . " [ Footsteps ] [ Groaning ] Follow me . There 's something I 'd like to show you . [ Beeping ] - Where 's the doc ? - This morning , he 's with his alives . He 's concentrating on further hybridization . He intends to continue and complete ... the initial terra-forming plans . - [ Sylibus ] But that 's impossible . - Yes , rational thought would agree . - [ Gasps ] - Don 't worry . The unborn sister poses no threat . Dr. Asakura gave up weapon production . He left this new model unfinished . But why ? A difference of opinion with his partner Professor D 'Anclaude . I ... That 's enough . Let 's go . Is there something else ? I brought you here because I felt you had previous knowledge ... of the Third 's being created as " assassinroids . " Nice upgrade . Go on . It 's the unfinished work . Professor D 'Anclaude began work on female " assassinroids , " which would some way complement the multitude of my brothers . Along with myself and Armitage , we were the pinnacle of robotic creation . Although our strength and abilities far surpassed humans , it was quite simple to assimilate ourselves into their society . Then Dr. Asakura used us as a base of synthetic organisms ... in developing the Thirds , programming creativity and life instead of the directive to destroy . Unfortunately , all the prototypes had an imperfection . There were many instabilities within the logic boards of the Third C.P.U. Of course , Dr. Asakura 's present state of mind ... prevented him from ever quite perfecting the female models . I 'm nothing . He couldn 't finish . I 'm useless . - He doesn 't even care ! - No , wait . [ Sylibus ] I don 't understand . Why even create a Third type ? I mean , the Seconds were good enough , even on Earth . Perhaps being from Earth , you do not have the knowledge ... of the difficulties there are with low Martian birthrates . No . I 've heard ... What 's it mean ? Any colony desiring independence ... requires a populace . Otherwise , they can 't develop a new identity . And Mars will continue to be weak ... as long as it remains dependent upon the Earth for its immigration . Well , what about Conception ? There 's got to be more behind it than just the money that 's involved , right ? Indeed . Manufacturers of Thirds , which can give birth , gain strength through numbers . The more people they represent , the stronger their position grows . Logical . But then the assassinations make no sense . They do , if you 're the government ... and hope to sign a treaty with the Earth Federation . [ Fanfare ] Nah , they couldn 't . Do you think they 've really done it ? Mars has no other recourse . The Earth Federation is now strongly feminist . A robot who can conceive contradicts ... the basis of the Terran party 's position of basic humanity . For Mars to agree , Mars must eliminate the Thirds . They are now an obstruction . Is that what you think , that I 'm just old Martian garbage to be thrown out ? You 're wrong . I 'm gonna stay alive for as long as I can . Exactly . Your programming for self-preservation ... is exactly equal to ours for eliminating your kind . But I am now refined . Unlike my brothers , I respect your wish for continued life . [ Beeping ] - Hey , Eddie . Huh ? - He 's on suspension ... for aiding a fugitive : section ten . No , sir , not if I forced him into it . Perhaps he 'll be pardoned . I 'll submit it . This Dunwich Hill dome ... has become a military attack point . The government has made its own connections ... between you two and the terrorist attack at Shenora . This is an official notice . You 're a threat to the government . The M.P.D. officially denounces all of your activities . - So Eddie friggin ' squealed . - He didn 't . How could an officer who I put on suspension say anything at all ? - Thanks a lot . - [ Lt. Randolph ] I 'm sorry . Sorries aren 't good enough . - And just what the hell are we gonna do now ? - Survival . It 's basic training . Lieutenant Randolph and friends ... signing off . Great . You 're in charge . What now ? We gotta get my father out . [ Male Announcer ] Good morning , and this morning is our day of new hope . Our planet , often beleaguered with nightmarish social confusion , has been finally pieced together again with the help from our true home world . Federation chairwoman Everhart has taken two planets ... and given us one world , one nation . Today , we are reborn ... as a unified humanity . They 're gonna blow all of us up straight to hell . [ Asakura ] My alives are not yet ready to leave . They 're gonna be your tinder logs in a few seconds . - Papa ! - Wilbur , get the important work into the old storage backup system . Don 't worry about me . I 'll be safe . It 's you I ... [ Gasps ] Maybe you are a nut , but I 'm your damn daughter , and you know it . This is a police order . Evacuate . You 're still a little fireball , aren 't ya , my Naomi ? [ Gasps ] Papa ! Oh ! - [ Buzzing ] - Ah ! - Armitage ! - She 's all right . You must think I 'm a great coward , Mr. Sylibus , but if the alives and myself are to die , I must at least save one thing . Poor child . [ Moans ] Daddy will fix it . Daddy will fix his little girl . [ Asakura ] There . It 's finished , Naomi . Now you are real . [ Beeping ] [ Beeping ] [ Male Announcer ] Last night 's slogan of " one world , one nation " ... has this morning blossomed into a new Martian thought toward " two worlds , one humanity . " [ Rumbling ] [ Explosion ] [ Alarm Blaring ] Hey , listen . I think Eddie knows a guy who can hide us as cargo on an Earth shuttle . I still got friends who can get you a new I.D. I don 't want that . I 'm going back , back to St. Lowel . [ Helicopters Whirring ] - [ Crashing ] - I don 't wanna see you die . You won 't have to . We 'll say good-bye here . I think that 's a great idea , don 't you ? It 's a pretty place if you just ignore the smell from all the bombs . Armitage , you know I hate it when you talk like shit that way . [ Gasps ] So what ? The whole planet hates your kind ... without any damn reason at all . - Just like I did . - I know they do . But if ... [ Sniffling ] There 's someone else ... Oh , Ross , I love you so very much . [ Crying ] Hey , go wherever you want , but you 're never gonna lose me now . Thank you for coming , sir . This is an MFN special news break . Chairwoman Everhart 's car has just turned onto the main thoroughfare ... in downtown St. Lowel . Her bright smile of success is met with the cheers ... of thousands of admirers lining the streets . The humanity of Mars is now whole again : One world , one nation . One world , one nation . Two thousand . - Look what Dad gave me . - What ? It 's a little too angelic for my taste , but now I 've got some real power . We 'll need it . Let 's show ' em . [ Grunting ] Look at all the space we 've got out here . Room as far as the eye can see . I grew up in a small house , which was hard with a lot of brothers and sisters . It was always a battle to find some small corner to call your own . When I became a man , I thought I 'd live in some wide-open place like Arizona . But as I grew older , I realized that I belonged in the city , surrounded by the buildings and the bustle of people . A place like this is too spacious for my taste . So long as I 've got the right partner , that 's where I 'll make my home . I won 't care who my neighbors are , whether they 're Martian or robots . A place we can claim for our own . Do you suppose there is such a place ? If we can 't find it , then , by God , we 'll create a place just for the two of us . Do you think there 's room for three ? [ Chuckles ] You 're kidding . Well , when that happens , I guess I 'll just have to think of something .

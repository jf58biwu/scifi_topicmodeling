 Educator of the decade ? Me ? Oh , sweet baby James ! Mr. Scampi , we 'd love to get a sound bite for the evening news . The news ! Yes , yes , of course . I 'd like to express my gratitude for this rare honor- - Iowa hog growers educator of the decade . ( Grunting softly ) You work ... tirelessly ... Thanklessly ... And think nobody 's paying attention ... And then something like this comes along ... Soo-eee ! Very nice . Very nice , sir . - So , Mr. Frehley ... - Oh , please , you call me Ace . You got it ... Ace . When can I expect my lifetime supply of bacon ? Oh , about the same time pigs fly . ( Chortling ) That ... voice . You 're not really Ace Frehley . - Chester ! - You 've been stung . ( Cackling ) ( Continues laughing ) Chester ! What did you do to my living room ? - It 's the holodeck you asked for . - Holodeck ? Yuppers . It 's a total immersive V.R. Experience . Just pick your favorite fantasy and it all comes to life in that chamber . Check out the brochure . " Battle space aliens . " Capture Al Capone . Escape from Stalag 16 . " Hop in for the ride of your life . It doesn 't look safe . Put a rat in it first and see what happens . - Excuse me ? - Put a rat in it . Come back here . ( Yelling ) Uh-oh . I want an apology ! You ... strangle like a girl . WYATT : What 's happening to them ? They 're enjoying the wonders of my holodeck . " Escape from Stalag 16 . " Lisa ... get us out of here . This isn 't funny . Unless I miss my guess we 're in the middle of a World War II P.O.W. Camp . God is punishing me for raising a hand to a student and the blind panic should be kicking in just ... about ... Now ! ( Yelling ) Stop , Scampi ! ( Gunshots ) ( Both yelling ) WYATT : Get them out of there , Lisa . They can 't actually leave until the program runs its course and the scenario won 't end until they actually escape from the camp . - Couldn 't we just pull the plug ? - Bad idea . That would melt their brains . Cooler . You really want to walk these new fish to the cooler ? If you ask me they ain 't worth the Shoe Leather . What do you offer me ? Pack of smokes ... Belgian chocolate and the capper ... " Home of the Little Corporal . " Oh . You Americans with your libertine ways . Ach . Come on , you mugs before schmitty changes his mind . Oh ! ( French accent ) : Sergeant Scampi ! Colonel Donnelly . Welcome to Stalag 16 . I 'm a colonel ? Bitchin ' . I am Lieutenant Pommefritte the tunnel man . You give me two nights and a bent spoon I will provide an escape tunnel a mile long . The earth , she is my woman . Sergeant Manfredi you have already met , eh ? Yeah , I 'm the Scrounger . I get you anything you want for a price- - Uh , Hooch , movie star pinups , Hungarian crushed velvet curtains ... I 've got a catalog somewhere here . This is Garner , our demolitions expert . GUARD : Everyone outside ! Raus ! Raus ! Raus ! Whoo . Guten tag , mein herren . ( Chuckling ) I am Kommandant Liebdich , which in the German tongue means " love you " and I do love you , each and every one of you . My prisoners are my children . Oh , yes . But if you misbehave then my guards will have to spank you with their machine guns . ( Laughing ) Jawohl , Herr Butt-Skank . ( Laughter ) What is this " Butt-Skank " ? Who has said this " Butt-Skank " ? Hmm ? ! If I do not receive an answer there will be no scary goblin masks permitted this Halloween . Well , it wasn 't me . It was Donnelly . - ( Grunting ) - Come on , fellas , we all heard him . Nobody likes a tattletale . To the cooler ! It 's just a little smoke . Perfectly normal . - It 's venting . - Admit it , it 's a death trap . I 'd like to point out that it 's still running . Okay , a fully functioning deathtrap . I built this baby rock solid . 10,000 gigawatts coursing through it and not even a flutter . 10,000 gigawatts through a 110-volt household outlet ? ( Sputtering ) LISA : Well , it was working perfectly fine - until you guys came home . - ( Both whimpering ) See ? Superior craftsmanship . The reserve power system just kicked in . Or ... something . ( Dogs barking ) All lights out ! Raus ! Schnell ! ( Whispering ) : It 's all clear . As I was saying the escape tunnels will be finished shortly . Soon , mes amis , we will break the heady nectar of freedom . Ha ! So ... How 's that escape going , guys ? You got room for one more ? Uh ... Well , normally , I would say yes but , uh , there 's only room in the escape tunnels for ... Well , all of us except you . I think I understand what 's going on here . Chester ... a word . What ? The boys and me are planning an escape here . And I don 't want to be left behind . The other dogfaces ... they seem to have ... accepted you . Why should I help you ? All you ever did for me was give me detentions confiscate my penthouses and get me in trouble with my parents . I am not responsible for you breaking the rules , Chester . You kicked me out of Farber and got me sent to military school . You know what that was like ? One time the upperclassmen made me walk through the quad ... Holding a live goldfish in my butt-cheeks . ( Laughs ) But the last laugh 's on you , Scamps . 'Cause military school prepared me for situations like this . Now you 're trapped in my world . Guard : All clear ! - Cheese it ! - You better find a bunk . That 's my bunk . Not there . ( Snoring ) Cooler ! We 're losing backup power fast . You 're saying when it hits zero Chett and Scampi are dead men ? Yeah , well ... technically . Well , then you 've got to zap in there and help them escape . Me ? Get inside that thing ? Not likely . Okay , okay . Touch nothing . LISA ( German accent ) : On your feet , soldier ! ( Groans ) I am Field Marshall Wisenhiemer . I have letters of transit for two of your prisoners . Their names are Donnelly and Scampi . But th-these letters of transit are in English . It is in secret code , you cowardly dog ! Most clever , Herr Wisenhiemer . Ouch . Oops . Your hair seems to be a bit beyond regulation length . Of course , rank has its privileges , nicht wahr ? It is bouncing ' and behaving ' . ( Giggles ) Thank you . Thank you ? Hah ! Thank you ? ! Us German guys never say " thank you " ! You are a fake German guy ! Guards ! You are very good , Wisenhiemer ... But no disguise can escape these eagle eyeballs of mine . Take this man to the cooler ! Hm ! Well , so much for operation " genie drop . " - What now ? - We have to take steps . If the power keeps dropping in 20 minutes we 'll have some brain melts on rye . We 're going to have to go in . How do we know we 're going to get back out in one piece ? We 'll have to take that chance . Wait ... I just thought of something . I saw this once on Poltergeist . We 'll throw this in first and see if it comes back okay . Whoo ! So , where 's it come out ? ( Uncertain mutter ) Huh ? Hey , you do some nice work on these passports . I also do permission slips report cards and drug tests . Merde . The goons have discovered the escape tunnel in the latrine . - How ? - Someone left the seat up . Okay . The escape tunnel 's out . There 's got to be another way out of this rat-hole . We could use the second escape tunnel . ( Grunts ) She 's no good to us . There 's a second escape tunnel ? The escape tunnel she is located in the Kommandant 's office . There 's got to be a way to get men in there . We need a distraction . The Kommandant- - does he have any weaknesses ? No . His will is iron . Unless you count his unholy obsession with female German shot-putters . Ach ... lose Miss May . You have served me well . ( Sniffing ) But now it is time to say hello to the delicate Miss June . Whoa ! Wow-das-wow-wow . ( Smooch ) If only there was a female shot-putter - we could use as a decoy . - ( Laughs ) Good luck , mon ami . There are no women within 500 kilometers of here . One of us will have to throw on a dress and seduce the Kommandant . Ah , but who ? This mission is extremely dangereuse . Listen up , everybody ! I got something to say ! Now , I 'm a patriotic American . Therefore , I request ... No- - demand ... Inclusion in any and all future escape plans . Do I make myself clear ? ! You know , there is one job that we need handled . Great . I 'm your man . - Not for long . - ( Restrained laughter ) ( Chuckling ) Those Katzenjammer kids ... They are always getting into Dutch . ( Throat clearing ) ( Higher-pitched throat clearing ) Mein gott . Guten tag , mein herr . Ausgezeichnet . Und , Fraulein , in the ' 36 Olympics did you put your shot for the red , white , and black ? The ... ' 36 Olympics ? That was quite a workout . I had to throw the shot put ... Really far . Never mind that . How far ... Will you go ? Would you give this naughty soldier boy a good spanking ? Ooh , I love it when my buns get cherry red . Well , uh ... let 's not ... let 's not ... rush things . Have another glass of wine . You don 't have to get me drunk , you know . I am ... easy . Ooh ! Jiminy . The Germans sure can hold their sodium penathol . Aren 't you the least bit sleepy ? Wine does not make me sleepy , only frisky . I am seeing double , but I am feeling single . - You look so tense . - Ja , ja , ja . How about a nice shoulder massage ? Ah , ja , that is the sweet spot . The Kommandant 's not going down . We 've got to abort the escape . And do what ? Abandon Scampi ? That man 's putting his tail on the line for you guys . We 're backing him up . The escape continues . That 's an order , sergeant ! No more with this stalling now make me the loving . And now I will be sleepy . ( Snoring ) Willikers . That was a close one . Hey , Fritzie , I got another joke for you . What do you call the fuhrer buried up to his neck in sand ? Not enough sand . I hear nothing . I hear nothing . How do you get a one-armed fuhrer out of a tree ? Wave to him . I will give you a thrashing now ! Dummkopf . Fell for the old belt-attached-to - the-welcome mat trick . Scampi : Hey , fellas . A little help here ! - Shh ! - Shh ! Sorry . We can 't risk waking that ratzi schnook . Get him off me . Get him off me ! If you leave me I 'll be shot . Fear not , mon ami . Word of your heroic sacrifice will sweep through Paris like a wildfire children will sing of your courage grandmothers will light candles in your memory and beautiful women will want to sleep with me just because I knew you . Merci , mon ami . It 's no use . He 's hanging on like an ugly girlfriend . Go , Chester . Save yourself . - You mean that , don 't you ? - Of course I do . What principal wouldn 't give his life for a former student ? You 're not going to die here , Scampi . Not today . You 're going to live a nice , long life . And every minute of that life you 're going to know that I saw you with lipstick , heels and a 200-pound pile of Sauerkraut wrapped around your legs . You will die ... now . Frauleins first . Game called on account of unconsciousness . What about this scenario ? " Polynesian Paradise . " Is that a volcano ? Yeah , but it stays dormant as long as they toss in a virgin every once in a while . Okay , here 's a quiet one- - " Amish Barnraising . " I don 't like the looks of that pitchfork . ( Both whistling " When Johnny Comes Marching Home " ) Hey , shouldn 't we wipe Scampi 's memory ? Ooh , I almost forgot . Where am I ? Can 't remember . Ace Frehley . I remember Ace Frehley . Ace . Pigs . Bacon . Shame . Uh-oh . ( Yelling ) No ! ( Alarm sounds ) I remember this . Chester , this time you get to be the woman . Captioned by Grant Brown

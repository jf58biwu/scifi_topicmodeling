 [ honks horn ] - Where 're you heading ? - Anywhere you are , sugar . Climb in . You could snuggle up a little closer here , sweet cakes . I wish I had the time- - really- - but the only thing I need under me right now is a few more miles . Where you going ? - Vegas . - Oh , yeah ? You a gambler ? I 'm a dancer . CHETT : Dual air bags , smooth ride firm rear suspension ... import of the year . First time I 've given it to a korean model . - You 're disgusting . - Oh , come on . Maria 's won two years in a row . - It 's someone else 's turn . - Women are not sex objects . They 're people- - with feelings . Back me up here , Wy . What ? Whatever happened to treating woman with respect ? I treat women the way they want to be treated . Oh . I 've got to hear this . Who wouldn 't want to be a sex object ? LISA : You really don 't have a clue , do you ? I know what I know and I know I 'd love to be ogled . Go ahead . Think of me as a piece of meat . Undress me with your eyes . Get hot of my body . I 'm not asking you , I 'm telling you . Well , since you 're telling me . - Lis , should I ask ? - Chett wanted to be ogled . [ dance music playing ] - Ooh ... - WOMAN : What 's happening , cowboy ? Note to myself : got to stop pissing off that genie . - Boo ! - Hey , where you going ? - Yeah ... - Boo ... Come on , show us something . - Boo ! - Boo ! - Lis , he 's being totally humiliated . - Hush . I 'm ogling him . - Anyone got change for a dollar ? - [ laughter ] - You owe me 50 cents . - [ laughter ] - Here 's your 50 cents . - [ audience oohing and ahhing ] Aim it over here . - Yeah ! Come on ! - Whoo ! Well , hello , Mr. Lincoln . Shoot , yeah . Whoo ! [ women cheering ] If he licks the pole , I 'm going to hurl . Any minute now the humiliation will kick in . Yep . Any minute . CHETT : Vegas ! Sin City . Stripping capital of the world . The only place I can realize my true destiny- - To be ... a dancer ... a show boy ... a star . All right , dancers , everyone over here . - You look nervous . First time ? - Yeah . Hell , I been in the John for an hour reliving lunch . A happy meal is no joy on the return trip . I 'm sure you 'll do just fine . My name is Xybo , and you 'd be ... - Chett Donnelly , right ? - That 's me . - Your legs aren 't shaved . - Am I supposed to ? - I didn 't know . - No , no . No big deal , no big deal . At least you don 't have to live with these saddlebags . Oh ... I like your ... thighs . Really ? Thanks . You just jumped to the head of the line . Oh , wait a minute , wait . There . Perfect . You knock ' em dead . [ dance music playing ] [ applause ] [ sighs ] I don 't know what you call that , boy-o , but it ain 't dancing . It 's magic . My name 's Lily . I own the place . - You 're hired . - Oh , wow ! I ... I mean , thank you . Come on , I 'll show you the ropes . These are the ropes and these are the whips and these are the chains . Don 't forget to sign them out . You 're responsible for your costumes and makeup . You got any questions ask one of the other dancers . Buck . Bolt . Grit . Stand aside , Peons . - Who 's that ? - That 's Ramses . He 's our headliners . Stay out of his way , you 'll get along fine . You can set up here . But Lily , this is my table . It 's always been my table . You 're through , Flex , washed up . Your abs are shot and you can barely hang on to the pole . I told you it wouldn 't last forever . Now get out . [ whimpers ] You have stars in your eyes , all right . Protect them . - Don 't burn too bright , young star . - Get out . I don 't want to cause a fuss . No fuss , Chett . Lily takes care of her dancers ... especially her favorite . ANNCOUNCER : Let 's give it up for Chett . We 're done with the teasing . On with the pleasing . - You know what you want- - - Ramses ! Ramses ! Coming through . Hey ... good luck out there . Stage hand , tell this impertinent worm not to speak to Ramses . - Oh ... sorry . - You 're getting psyched up . There continues to be an annoying buzz in Ramses ' ear . - Do quell it . - Hey , I ... [ woman cheering ] He 's a jerk ... but a hell of a dancer . That 'll be me out there someday , Xybo . You watch . - I 'm going to be a headliners too . - Well , this is Vegas . There 's always room for two at the top . [ dance music playing ] How come when a wish blows up in Chett 's face he ends up surrounded by horny , screaming women ? Yeah ! Whenever a wish goes south on us we end up battling 50-foot sewer rats . Bite me . WOMEN : [ chanting ] Ramses ! Ramses ! Ramses ! Ramses ! Ramses ! Ramses ! Phew ! What is that , Lard ? Chicken fat . It makes Ramses ' muscles extra shiny . [ growling ] [ women screaming ] [ siren blaring ] [ gasps ] I 'm going to headline ? I thought Ramses was the headliner . - Well , now he 's a flat-liner . - You 're going to the show , kid . Thanks . Lil . I won 't let you down . That 's why you 're my favorite . Buck , mop the stage . Bolt , change the marquee . Grit , break out the leg wax . Tonight , a star is born . WOMEN [ chanting ] : Chett ! Chett ! Chett ! [ hard rock music playing ] Oh , my . [ electrical buzz ] What 's this ? Huh ? What is this ? It 's a beer . Why are you acting this way ? A light beer ! I don 't drink light beer ! The star of the show doesn 't drink light beer . [ glass breaking ] Well , Ramses lives . - How 's my little star tonight ? - Miserable . My new thongs are all two sizes too big and they forgot to mop up after the beans-and-franks wrestling- - again . I can 't work here anymore . I just can 't . This isn 't about beans and franks . You got an offer . Didn 't you ? I got an audition at Caesar 's . Lead dancer in " locked room follies " . This is my dream , Lil . Stripping 's behind me . I 'm finally going legit . There 's talk of taking " locked room " to Broadway . You 're okay with this , aren 't you ? Of course , sweetie . I want what 's best for you . Uh ... who 's the audition for ? Jared Storm . Oh , Jared ... he 's an old friend of mine . I 'll call , put in a good word for you . Tell him you got the tightest tush in Sin City . Thanks , Lil . Call Jared Storm . Tell him I own Chett Donnelly . The only way he 's leaving this club is on two broken legs . LILY : Be careful with those million-dollar legs . How long have you been standing there ? Long enough . Want me to scrub your back ? It 's still a little sensitive from the stab wounds . - Oh , what 's the matter , sweetie ? - Caesar 's cancel my audition . Jared Storm cast Richard Grieco instead . Xybo told me what you did . I 'm sorry , but I had to protect my favorite little investment . It was just business . Here 's something that 'll cheer you up . I 'm starting a new advertising blitz . There won 't be a billboard in town without your iron glutes shining down on it . - I don 't like it . - What ? Why not ? It 's degrading . I look ridiculous . Just because a guy wears a thong doesn 't mean he 's a bimbo . Don 't kid yourself . You think you 're a dancer that strips ? - No . - You 're a stripper that dances . I am a dancer . You signed a contract . I own you- - Lock , stock ... and jock . You can 't own somebody . You need to learn a little humility . You 'll dance where I tell you ... and when I tell you . Try and make me . Whoo ! You want a buff ? It 's five extra . [ squeaking ] Whoo ! This is your gilded thong strippergram . No flash photography , no touching the dancer tipping is not required but is encouraged . Dance for me . [ dance music playing ] Take off your jacket . Very good . Now , take off your socks . What ? [ tape rewinds ] [ tape jams ] - Take off your ... - Is your voice on tape ? No . I have a head cold . - Now , take off your socks . - Lisa ? [ groans ] Okay , you caught me . But look at you- - you 're pathetic . - Why didn 't you just call me for help ? - Everything 's fine . Sure I miss the beer and solid foods but I get to pick my own music and they don 't make me do the lollipop dance anymore . Chett , look at yourself . You 're being used and degraded and humiliated . Why can 't you just admit that it 's no fun to be a sex object ? I 'm on the clock here . You want me to dance or not ? You are impossible . Why is she always right ? What did you say ? - Nothing . - Okay , fine . [ rock plays ] - Where 's Chett ? ! - He wouldn 't admit he was wrong . I know he 's miserable but he 's too pigheaded to ask for help . Chett 's ego is very vulnerable right now ! Maybe he wants you read between the lines ! You really think so ? Yeah , stripping feeds Chett 's deep-seated need for acceptance . Dropping his pants is simply a metaphor for dropping his emotional barriers ! I never thought of it that way . That or he really gets off on it . Hey , thunder buns . Are those ears pointy or are you just glad see me ? Came back for a sneak peek ? Why don 't you buy a ticket like everybody else ? - Actually , I came here to apologize . - You did ? I know you 're happy here being a sex object . Personally , I 'd be uncomfortable with it but if you like shaking your cakes for cash go for it . You didn 't come here to tell me I was wrong and use all your magical powers to take me away from this horrible place ? Not unless you want me to . Well , I have proven my point and throughly enjoyed being a sex object . A very sexy sex object . Okay , I quit . Let 's go . - Warp nine , engage . - [ crackling ] - What happened ? - I don 't know . - Switching to impulse power . - [ crackling ] You didn 't sign anything ? A contract maybe ? - Uh ... - Sign right there ... and here ... and here ... A lifetime contract . You better zap that too . I can 't . The moral inhibitors in my program prevent me from violating a signed contract . Magic can 't help you . Well , I guess that only leaves me one option . [ applause ] [ growling ] [ women cheering ] Ooh , they love you , Chett and they want you ... bad . - You want to know how I know ? - Don 't go there . - Okeydoke . - Hey . Don 't sweat it . - [ music starts ] - There 's your music . Now , walk like an egyptian . Xybo ... you 've been a bud . - Chett ! - [ tiger roaring ] - [ women screaming ] - No ! Well , his dancing days are over . Good job , Sheera . - Messy but effective . - [ growling ] I 'd love to take credit but , actually , it was Chett 's idea . Speaking of Chett we probably ought to pry him out of there . - You get the contracts ? - Shredded . - You 're in the clear . - Give me five more minutes . I 'm trying to get rid of these thong lines . Hey , kid . I thought you were going to be a dancer . Me too . It 's funny . I came to Vegas chasing my dream but I found something even more important- - self-respect . All these years I 've been seeing women as sex object first people second . Now I know how wrong I was . You 're looking at my chest , aren 't you ? I am a weak man . Whoa ! Here you go- - your favorite thong . If it makes you feel any better you got a standing ovation . Captioned by Grant Brown

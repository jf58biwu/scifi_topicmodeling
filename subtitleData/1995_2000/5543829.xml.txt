 ( WHOOSH ) All right ? Anyone serving or what ? ( WOMAN ) With you in a minute , luv . ( BABY CRIES ) - Hello , Frank . What can I get you ? - Look what I found under the pool table . - Any note ? - No , nothin ' . Oh ! They 've written its name on the side here . " Our Rob or Ross . " Look how it 's spelt . They must 've been thicker than a ticket tout 's wad . - Couldn 't even decide on a name . - Oh , poor little mite . I wonder what 'll become of him ? Somethin ' terrible , no doubt . I hate doing that ! I hate doing that ! ( TINKLING ) Smeg ! I 've just sneezed out me cap ! Just thought I 'd change your linen before you turn in for the night , sir . Kryten , I 've lost me cap . No , here it is , sir . I 've just finished giving it its monthly scrape . My tooth cap , the one you made from the skeleton in medi-bay . - Oh , I see . - Hey ! Here it is . I need some glue to stick it in . I 've just got that needly , pointy thing . - Let me see . - No , it 's all needly , pointy and disgusting . Let me see , sir . I 'm a mechanoid . I won 't be revolted . OK . Oh , my God ! It 's hideous ! ( GIGGLES ) Yeah , very funny . Just fix it . It 'll take an hour to prepare some dental adhesive . Give me some wood glue . You can redo it in the morning . Wood glue ? Are you sure , sir ? Don 't get your lips glued together . Oh , incidentally , I just found some old clothes in one of the storage lockers . Hey ! I need a dressing gown . Well , that 's what I thought . I thought if I remove the trim , let it out a little bit , obviously dye it , it could be just dandy . Yeah . Nice one , Kryts . Perhaps I could take the necessary measurements now , sir ? I wonder why guys have nostril hair . I think it 's nature 's way of telling you it 's time to buy a flat cap and a pair of driving gloves , sir . Worst are those guys who just let it grow . They look like they 've got half a loo brush lodged up each nostril . They look like those machines that shine shoes . Curious , isn 't it , that most women aren 't similarly afflicted . Obviously , I 'm excluding women who work in Oxfam shops . Pain : It evens itself out , doesn 't it ? Women have the agony of childbirth and we have ... this . ( WHINES ) They don 't know they 're born ! What is wrong with me ? Now I 've got a box of floss attached to me face ! Hey ! Nice outfit ! - Did you come in here for a reason ? - Oh , yeah ! Something 's showing up on the long-range scan which is weird with a capital " WE " . - Can you be a tad more scientific ? - Come again ? Is it a wibbly thing or a swirly thing ? At this early stage , I 'd hate to commit myself and wind up looking a fool . See for yourself . Wibbly thing or swirly thing ... and he refuses to commit himself ? He 's losing it . He really is . It 's some kind of power surge causing a major disturbance in the fabric of space-time . It 's also causing a major disturbance in the fabric of my pants ! - It 's almost like a tear . - Perhaps a temporal rip . I 'm gonna turn this tub around and try and outrun it . Get real , man . That thing up there 's going faster than a copy of " Hello ! " in a nunnery . Suggest we treat it like a tidal wave and head straight for the eye of the storm . Are you sure about that ? Because intestines and a suit won 't work without colon-coloured accessories . I need to know - should I change ? Cat , go for it , man . The eye of the storm . We seem to be through the worst of it ... but I 'm picking up some kind of sub-space energy disturbance on the engineering deck . You 're right , sir . It 's off the scale . Now , for a sub-space energy disturbance , I 'm dressed perfectly . Let 's check it out . According to the psi-scan , the membrane between two realities has temporarily collapsed . This is some kind of hyperway through non-space to a parallel dimension . Let 's have a goosey . ( TEARING AND WHOOSHING ) Careful , sir . The linkway 's about as stable as an Italian taxi driver who 's got stuck behind two old priests in a Skoda . What the hell is that ? Non-space , sir . An abyss of infinite nothingness where time doesn 't seem to exist . Sounds like Rimmer 's organ recital night . I recognise those guys . Wait . Don 't tell me . How 's it going ? - You 're a hologram . - Hard light . So in your dimension Lister died ? In the radiation leak that wiped out Red Dwarf . Why weren 't you put into stasis like me ? What happened ? Remember coming back from shore leave on Mimas ? I 'd taken a couple of days off to get over Kochanski . Yeah , I remember ... Where the hell have you been ? I 've reported you as AWOL . I 've been on shore leave , man . Didn 't you get me message ? You 're supposed to apply to a superior officer before you get shore leave , Lister . Look , give me a break . Ever since Kochanski split with me , I 've needed time on me own . - Kochanski dumped you ? - Yeah . - She really dumped you ? - Yes ! You didn 't tell me ! You should 've told me . Are you really heartbroken ? - You know , man , you know ... - You are , aren 't you ? OK , yes ! Yes ! Didn 't I tell you you 'd never bridge that class division ? Take her - navigation officer , cadet school , Space Corps , well-spoken , can stay awake during operas , knows her cheeses . She 's class . And you ? What are you ? I don 't mean to sound cruel , but in comparison you 're scum . And second-rate scum , at that . But don 't forget : I used to be fourth-rate scum . I 've dragged meself up by me bootstraps . Listy , Listy , your type isn 't Kochanski , Listy . It 's someone called Tiffany . Someone who drinks Campari and soda and wears orange crotchless panties , someone who thinks deelyboppers are funny , someone who says " sumfink " instead of " something " and laughs like a freshly-wounded moose strapped to a cement mixer . This from a man who 's had less sex than a lettuce . Oh , ha-ha ( ! ) People who say " ha-ha " have no sense of humour . They just can 't think of a witty retort . Oh , ha-ha ( ! ) Ms Kochanski , ma 'am . I don 't suppose you 've read my proposal for a new Space Corps salute ? It 's just , I 'm trying to get the support of the officers . I don 't want to pressure you , but it is rather important because if you like it , that brings the overall total of officers who are right behind it up to ... one . - Rimmer ? - Yes , ma 'am ? - Have sex with someone . That 's an order . - Yes , ma 'am . Right away . 'Ere . Ring this number . Say I sent you . Tell them it 's an emergency . - Hi - Hmm ... I just wanted to say , look , I 'm sorry for the Dear John . It was cowardly . What ? Oh , that ! Sorry , I 'd completely forgot . It seems like years ago . - It was last week . - Was it ? - Mm-hmm . - Must 've got over it just like that . Oh , come on , Dave . We weren 't going anywhere . How could we ? We never got out of bed . There 's more to life than hanging out in your bunk , eating delivery curries and having fantastic sex . - Frankly , I find that very hard to believe . - I wanted to see if we could be friends . - Do you mean give it another go ? - No , no . - I 'm , er ... back with Tim now . - Tim ? ! That guy is such a poser ! The way he always wears that white suit and that stupid , big floppy hat . He 's a chef . Yeah , but the way he poses around in it , in the officers ' club , smoking those black cigarettes . - He 's such a phoney . - At least he 's got a vocation . And you think because I happen to be vice-assistant vending machine deputy-minion maintenance repair man , I 'm nobody ? Well ... yes . Do you think a guy who gets free Crunchie bar samples hasn 't got connections ? - I just think ... - ( MIAOWING ) Do you know what you 'd get for smuggling a cat on board ? - What ? Cat-martialled ? - I could have you before a disciplinary board . - How long before ? Do I get chance to change ? - I 'm serious ! As serving N.O. , I 'm supposed to report it ! So report it . Get me put into stasis for six months . Don 't you know how dangerous it is to smuggle in an un-quarantined animal ? I was lonely . I 'd just been dumped by me girlfriend . It breaks every reg in the manual . ( BEEPING ) Just don 't get caught or I 'm out cold for six months , OK ? So you didn 't get put into stasis and died with the rest of the crew ? - Then Holly brought me back as a hologram . - What happened to Kochanski ? They found the cat , and she got six months in stasis . So does that mean ? Hi . - You look great ! - You look pretty amazing yourself . So in this dimension , you didn 't die ? You 're an alternate version of Dave . I think of meself as the definitive version , honed to perfection by time and evolution . I can see why you 'd think that . Sirs , ma 'am , we 've scarcely two hours before the dimensional tear self-repairs and we lose the linkway . I suggest we might spend some of that time exchanging supplies and information . We could update your hydrogen RAM-drive to a tachyon-powered engine core . And in return , maybe we can unscrew all those old pickle jars you can 't open . - There is something you could do for us . - Yeah ? At some point , I want to have children . It 's a slightly pervy thing to ask , especially since we 've just met , but perhaps you could ... - Yeah ? - After all , we 've been ... you know , lovers ... - Perhaps you could ... - Yeah ? - Fill this up . - I 'd rather be standing a bit closer . It 's a self-gamete mixing-in vitro tube . I 'm already in there . It just needs your ... contribution . So it worked out for you guys , then . I couldn 't be more happy . Well , outside a major dental surgery with a rusty knife . Congratulations . Gelf ship ! Somehow they 've managed to infiltrate non-space ! Kris , give me your hand ! Hang on to me feet , man ! It 's gonna give ! ( GRUNTS ) - She 's really something , isn 't she ? - Who is ? Officer Bud-Babe . In fact , I 'm barely hanging on to my title as most gorgeous creature on this ship . Oh , what am I talking about ? Am I crazy ? Cat , man , we 're under attack . It might be an idea to get us the smeg out of here . What happened ? I thought I 'd lost you ! - I think you 've mistaken me ... - Shh ! - What were you saying ? - Forget it . Oh , dear ! Sir , I think Miss Kochanski 's under the delusion that you 're ... - Not now , Kryten . - But you don 't understand . Miss Kochanski thinks ... - I 've handled it , OK ? Now , go make some sweet tea or something . - Er ... Permission to speak , sir ? - Permission refused ! - Wait a minute . This isn 't the medi-bay . - You must have mistaken me for your Lister . - That 's what I 've been trying to tell you ! - Were you ? If only you 'd listened to me , I could have saved you from all that yuckiness . Is that the kind of guy you are ? Someone who 'd take advantage of a woman who 's half insensible ? I was gonna tell you , honestly . They always taught me in school it was rude to talk with your mouth full . Wait , you mean I 'm stuck here with you ? Priscilla , Queen of Deep Space ? No way . I 've gotta get that linkway back ! ( CRASH ) It 's not exactly possible at the moment . We 're under attack . - It 's back on our tail ! - What is it ? Some Gelf battle cruiser . They 've sent a scan , sir . Take a look . Oh , my God . It 's the missus . - The what ? - Mr Lister 's Gelf bride . We all went to the wedding . It was just beautiful . - He married this ? ! - He had to . - You mean ? - We were in a fix ! We needed an engine part . You should visit the orang-utan house at London Zoo . Your eyes would be out on stalks ! They 're opening comms channels . Sir , they 're demanding you return to your bride . In Gelf law , separation is impossible without special dispensation from Hakakhhak-kkhhak ... hhakh-hhakhkhkahak-hkaahkahk-hkhk , Chief Justice of hakhakhk-aahkahkh hkhakkhaakhaaakah-akkk-hhakaaaak kak-akk-hakkakak ka ka ka . OK , patch me into the MCN , and I 'll lay down an SS line . - You 'll what , Officer BB ? - Quadrant 4-9-2 stroke G-8-7 , moving across to Quadrant 2 to Q-4-1 stroke 9 . - Just follow my coords . - Your cords ? - Yeah , my coords . - Follow your cords ? - Is that a problem ? - You 're not talking about trousers , are you ? Coordinates . Coordinates ! Thank you ! 20 degrees starboard on this next ' berg . They 're right on our tails . Hold this line . Keep holding ... Keep holding ... Lift now ! Pretty snazzy ! Still no sign of Miss Kochanski 's ship , sir . We 're fast running out of time . - I know . It 's good , isn 't it ? - No , sir . I don 't believe it is . - Don 't you like her ? - I 'm a mere mechanoid , sir . Hardly my place to point out what a ... bossy old trollop she is . - Good kisser , though . - She knew that was you all along , sir ! She was merely trying you out to compare you with her Mr Lister . Apparently , he 's quite something . Initially , a soft-light hologram , that 's made him sensitive and caring in a way most men aren 't . You mean he can remember anniversaries and stay awake for several seconds after sex ? He 's every woman 's dream guy , sir . He even enjoys shopping for shoes ! - Jesus ... - A human male who 's prepared to have in-depth discussions about " relationships " . Eurgh ! We 're talking about someone quite exceptional , sir . - Where does that leave me ? - Well , that leaves you ... trying to help me get her back to her rightful ship . She can 't stay here , sir . She just can 't ! Kryten , man , are you OK ? ( WHINES ) I just know we 're not gonna be able to get rid of her ! Is that so terrible ? She 's gonna take you away from me ! I just know it ! What ? ! I took her a glass of milk when she was showering . I 've seen her naked ! So ? She 's got all those in-and-out bits that you like . Kryten , no matter what happens , you and me , we 're compadres , amigos . But that 's all gonna change if she stays ! You 'll end up liking her more ! - I won 't ! I won 't ! - You will ! You will ! I won 't ! I won 't ! I won 't ! - You promise ? - I promise . So if she walked in here now and took all her clothes off and said , " Oh ! Make love to me , you horny dude , " and I said , " Perhaps you 'd prefer to fold some sheets with me instead , sir ? " What would you do ? What kind of sheets would they be ? Those nice cotton ones with the pattern . - The blue stripy ones or green square ones ? - The green square ones . So it 's making love to Kochanski or folding sheets with you ? - Can I do final fold-and-stack ? - Absolutely . - It 'd be sheets , then . - She 's standing there all naked with all the in-and-out bits going all inny and outy ? It 'd be the sheets , Kryt . You and me . Hospital corners . - Really ? - Too true . ( SQUEALS ) You 're lying ! You 're just trying to make me feel better ! Oh ! Why can 't she be more like Mr Rimmer ? He was perfect ! He didn 't have any in-and-out bits hardly at all . There 's no one I care more about than you , OK ? I 'd never dump you like she did ! Never ! - That 's not gonna change . - Never ? Never . - ( SQUEALS ) You 're lying ! - I 'm not lying ! Yes , you are ! I 'm gonna end up on my own just like I did on the Nova 5 ! You killed the crew , Kryten ! No wonder you ended up on your own ! It was an accident , but nevertheless ... But what about before that ? It was the same on the SS Augustus . They all died of old age ! You see ? ! ( BLEEPING ) I thought I 'd lend a hand and see if I could help you get out of here . I 've got a positive trans-dimensional trace , but I still can 't re-establish the linkway . I 'm sure it 's something to do with electro-magnetic phasing frequencies . - You took the words right out of my mouth . - Have you tried reversing the signal ? We 'll need a power re-route in the auxiliary power drives . I 'll take care of that ... whatever it is . It 's the big red button there , sir . Hey , Officer Bud-Babe , that power simillililillum-linilillum drive ? Taken care of . You don 't like me , do you ? - Ma 'am ? - You don 't , do you ? Ma 'am , I think it would be more efficient if we spent our energies trying to re-establish the linkway . - But why ? - Please . - I mean ... - Ma 'am ! - I need to know why ! - Do you indeed ? - Yes . - You 're not good enough for him ! That 's all . OK , he may walk around smelling like a Balti house laundry basket , but he doesn 't need the likes of you swapping dimensions like there 's no tomorrow and bewitching him with all your ... in-and-out bits , all pointy and unnecessary . You 've got big problems , you know that ? Well , at least I don 't have a ridiculous walk , unlike some people . Huh ! Have you seen the way YOU walk ? I have a perfectly sensible walk . At least I don 't walk like this : ( BLEEPING ) Phaser frequency 4-3-4 . We 've got it back ! What ? You 're right ! That 's it ! - I can leave ! - You can leave ! Here 's the 2,000 bulbs of garlic your Lister wanted . Phew-wee ! I may just have my nose hermetically sealed . Is this right ? 18 crates of curry and no pasta at all ? ( MOUTHS ) Champagne , everyone ! If this doesn 't deserve a celebration , I don 't know what does ! - What are we celebrating exactly ? - ( MOUTHS SILENTLY ) You 've found your crewmates at last ! How wonderful ! - Thanks , Kryten . - I must go and find the others . This is for you . It wasn 't easy . I 'm not exactly awash with helpful material here . I had to use one of Rimmer 's old James Last albums - a girl in a yellow crocheted miniskirt doing the twist . It was like peeling an orange with a chopstick . - I didn 't need to know that . - Anyway , it 's all worked . Just pop that in the uterine simulator in your medi-lab and ... bingo . - Wow ! - Our child . I 'll ... you know . - I know . - Any advice ? - For the baby , I mean . - What , advice about life and stuff ? Well , tell it you can always park nearer than you think . Don 't go to Sweden . Avoid sprouts . Oh , and if you 're a guy , never chop up hot chillies then go for a leak without washing your hands first . It feels like a bomb 's just gone off in your pants . That 's it . A lifetime 's worth of wisdom crammed into under a minute . As soon as it 's old enough , I 'll tell it all about you . Apart from how you eat spaghetti . Just make it understand why I 'm not there . I don 't want it ending up like me . What happened to you was really rough . The pool table , no note , no explanation ... I think that 's why I spent most of my early life drifting , you know ? I didn 't have anything to live up to ' cause I didn 't know who I was , where I came from , just those two names they couldn 't decide on calling me - Rob or Ross . Hey ... I 'll look after it . You know I will . Yeah , I know . Excuse me , sir . Just doing a spot of dusting here . Look , this is probably a long shot , but if we can hit the right settings , it may be possible to communicate trans-dimensionally . See you . Bye . - What 's this ? - Supplies from Bud-Babe 's ship . - No , this . - It 's the symbol for infinity . The snake eating its own tail , and thus completing the everlasting circle of life that has no beginning or end . - What 's it doing on here ? - The crate used to contain Ouroboros batteries . - Everlasting . - Ourobo-what ? ! Ouroboros , sir , it 's the name of the symbol . - What is it , bud ? - Ouroboros ... It wasn 't " Our Rob or Ross " , it was Ouroboros . What was ? The message that was written on the side of me box ! You came in a box ? That explains everything . I know who my parents are . I know who I am . I understand now . Explain , sir . The in-vitro tube , the one Kochanski 's got . The frozen embryo - it 's me ! At some point if the baby 's born , we must go back in time and leave him under the pool table at the Aigburth Arms . We wrote Ouroboros on the box to explain ! I 'm my own father ... and Kris is my ex-girlfriend and me mum ! You should write a letter to " Playboy " . I bet you anything it 'd get printed . I 've gotta get that test tube back . Wait ! - What ? - I need the in-vitro tube ! It 's me ! It 's what ? The Gelfs are back ! - What are you doing ? - I 'm gonna jump ! - You 'll never make it ! - Kris , no ! - Kristine ! - We 've lost her , sir . No . No ! Kristine ! ( PHONE RINGS ) - Yeah ? - Hi , it 's me . - Hi . - I 've decided to stay . Just one proviso ... - Yeah ? - Save my life , OK ? Cargo bay . Looking now . What 's this ? Mountaineering equipment from Miss Kochanski 's ship , sir . A crossbow ? I thought it might come in handy next time you run into your wife . ( KOCHANSKl ) You 've got about 20 seconds before I 'm out of reach ! Rope ? Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! I 'm getting a mite panicky here ! Argh ! Bastard ! ( PHONE RINGS ) It 's an obscene phone call , sir . I think it 's for you . I 've brought you a drink , but don 't think it means I 've gone all mushy on you . I 'm gonna get up and work out a way of re-establishing that linkway . It 's too late , ma 'am . The rip 's self-repaired . - ( WHINES ) We 're stuck with you ! - I 'm gonna try anyway . Oh , ma 'am ? Yes , Kryten ? Welcome aboard . Thanks , Kryten . For a long time , you 'll think that you were abandoned , but you weren 't , man . You were put here to create a paradox , an unbreakable circle . With us going round and round in time , the human race can never become extinct . We 're like ... a kind of holding pattern . I 'll see you , son . ( SONG ) It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere I 'm all alone , more or less Let me fly far away from here Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose Drinking fresh mango juice Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun Fun , fun , fun In the sun , sun , sun

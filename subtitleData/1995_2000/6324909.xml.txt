 Harry , is there any cereal left ? Nope . Guess I 'll just have some toast . No toast , either . Oh , and we 're also completely out of bread . Good morning ! Good morning . No , I tell a lie . It 's a great morning , and it will culminate in an even greater evening , for tonight Mary and I ... will attend king of the jig , starring Irish tap-dancing sensation peter Connelly . What happened to my delicious coffee ? You should really get yourself a bean grinder . This canned stuff 's intolerable . Oh ! I 'm gonna go and have a smoke . Sally , it appears that your new boyfriend has bogarted my coffee . Yeah . Something tells me he ate all our cereal , too . Yeah ? So ? We spent the night together . He got a little hungry . What 's the big deal ? You slept with him ? No . We were discussing his writing . He is an artist , you know . Yeah . A starving artist . Oh , Harry , that was pretty clever . Yeah . I have no idea why . I don 't like what this guy has done to you , Sally . You 're broody and moody , and your hair looks like .. like .. like what ? Doody . Yeah , well , what do you know ? You and your ivory tower , hurling down your wisdom McNUGGETS dipped in the special sauce of the establishment . Now hang on there , Missy . I command you to drop that ridiculous accent . What accent ? The bad English one . I don 't have to do a thing you .. Lieutenant . Okey-dokey . So , Mary , what time should I pick you up for king of the jig ? I 'm not going with you . But we made our plans 3 months ago . We broke up . Judith and I already got tickets . And I am not leaving that theater without a sweaty scarf . Well , what am I supposed to do ? Well , why don 't you bring one of your friends ? My friends ? Oh , oh . Yes , of course . It 's just that there 's so many . Choosing one could result in hurt feelings . Ironically , I might end up losing friends over this . Maybe we 'll see you there . Mm , yeah , I 'll see you there . Yeah , with one of my many , many friends ! Nina .. not a chance in hell . Are you sure you can 't make it ? It should be a great show . I told you , my name is Dick Solomon . You made a delivery at my office a few months back . Yes , I signed your electronic clipboard , and you made a nice comment about the size of my package . Hello ? Hello ? Oh , no . Is that baywatch ? It 's not baywatch . It 's baywatch nights . So what 's the difference ? It 's colder at night . There ! There 's something to feed your souls . Hey ! ... She will kill you . So you wanna go roller-Blading ? Oh , I don 't have any roller blades . How about a video game ? Oh , Harry has Yahtzee ! Yahtzee ! No offense , Solomon , but this place sucks . Hey ! You ! What ? Would you like to join me for a night at the theater ? No . This is so odd . I can 't find anyone who wants to join me for king of the jig . One could draw the mistaken conclusion that ... I don 't have any friends . King of the Jig ? Peter Connelly 's strip-mining an entire culture for profit . That is so true . And you know what else ? I need money for roller blades . Roller blades ? Yeah , and a few other things all my friends seem to have . Are things really gonna bring you happiness , Tommy ? Yeah . That saddens me . Great , Tommy . You made him sad . You happy ? Come on , Dick . Let 's see the wallet . No , Tommy , you 'll have to get your own money . I 'm stretched thin just covering the bare essentials : food , clothing , shelter , and theater tickets . Yeah , Tommy . You want money , maybe you should go get a job . Harry , Tommy has a job . Yeah . I go to school . Oh . Then maybe I should go get a job . Oh , man . Good evening . Would you by any chance need a ticket for the show ? We have tickets . That 's why we 're here . Well , what if I knocked off 5 bucks ? 10 bucks ? I 'm insane ! This ticket must go ! Hi , Dick . Hello , Mary , Judith . I-I 'm just waiting here for my friend . Well , I hope they get here soon . They 're going to close the doors in 5 minutes . Bear in mind : No one will be seated once Peter Connelly 's shirt comes off . Who needs tickets ? ! Tickets here ! Get your red-hot tickets ! Cut-Price tickets here ! Hey , what do you think you 're doing ? Oh , oh , no . Nothing illegal is going on here , officer . I just bought an extra ticket , and I 'm trying to unload it . You know , hopefully , for a nice profit . Scalping tickets is a misdemeanor . Come with me . Wait a second , uh ... it 's Ok , Rico . He 's a friend . Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . Don 's a friend of mine . Don and I are friends . My friend Don . All right . See you back at the station , Don . So , Don , I have an extra ticket . It 's yours if you want it . An extra ticket , huh ? I hear it 's a pretty good show . Pretty good ? The Rutherford bugle calls it " tap-licious . " Well , I suppose crime could strike inside the theater just as well as it could out here . Look at Abe Lincoln . Let 's go ! Ah ! Good news . The falafel connection needs a night manager . Harry , you go to bed at 8 : 00 . Besides , this job requires a high school diploma . Well , that 's discrimination . Man , you need diplomas for all these jobs . Yeah , which I don 't got . Let 's eat . Hey , wait . You are just gonna have to go to high school and get a high school diploma . No . Huh ? Nooo . Noooo ! Oh , forget it . I don 't wanna . Ah , Harry , come on . Let 's go sign you up . You see , you gotta think of a diploma as an investment . Yeah . An investment in your roller blades . Ah , you see ? You 're learning already . Oh , god ! Oh , that was the most spectacular thing I 've ever seen . Oh , was that great or what ? Oh , yes , my friend and I were just discussing it . Mary , Judith , you remember Don Orville . How do you do Ladies ? Dick , I didn 't realize you and Don were such good friends . Well , you know how it is- - the college professor and police officer , it 's a scheduling nightmare , but when we do find the time , Don and I are practically inseparable . Isn 't that right , Donny , old boy ? Not entirely . Hey , what are .. shh ! What are you wr .. shh ! What are you write .. shh ! What are you writing in your journal ? Oh , here they come . Right on time . Peter Connelly 's obedient little sheep . They 've sat through his puppet show , purchased his t-shirts , and now they 're here to discuss the experience and feel cultured . Oh , that 's pathetic . It 's not their fault . Connelly has them programmed . He 's the head of the monster . The head of the monster ? Yeah , I 'd like to have 5 minutes alone with that phony . Why ? What would you do to him , Seth ? Let 's just say ... he would never dance again . Oh , yeah . Ha ha . Oh , I would love to see that . Yeah . Oh , that would be great . Him not dancing , right ? Look , I 'm trying to write ! Incoming ! You get it ? ' Cause we 're coming in , right ? Heh heh heh . Ahh ... turns out paintball is lot more fun than I thought , huh , Don ? Well , you didn 't have to tie me down and do me execution-style . Come on , I was just playing around . No hard feelings . Hey ... friends ? Friends . Let me buy you a beer . Hey ! 2 beers here . I 'd like to get a couple of Rutherford railroad stouts . Yeah ? you know , they brew it right here in Rutherford . Really ? Yeah , they put a microbrewery in the old ... brewery . We ought to go take a tour sometime . Yeah . Free samples . Can 't beat that with a stick . No , sir , you can 't . And you know ... the ladies love the beer . Oh , yeah . You know who else loves the beer ? Pathetic lonely guys . Ok , enough of that . So tomorrow night I was thinking sushi and the dog track ? Well , that sounds like fun , but tomorrow night 's no good for me . What ? You working the late shift ? No . Oh , you got a hot date ? No . Who is she ? Come on , come on . No , no ... heh heh heh . No , I 'm going out with my buddy Ernie . We 're bowling a couple of games and eating some chicken wings . Oh , of course . Chicken wings . I 'm sure you 'll have a good time with your buddy Ernie . Smooth . Disappointing . Come on , Harry . It 's time for school . How do I look ? What is this ? What ? My backpack . Yeah . It 's a backpack . You don 't wear it on your back . Just throw it over your shoulder . I 'm a little nervous . All right , all right . There 's no need to be . Night school is the same thing as regular school . The only difference is it 's at night . Which makes it really spooky . Granted . But there 's only a few things you need to remember , you know : make sure the tough guys think you 're cool , grab a seat next to a babe , and , uh , you know , don 't let the teacher push you around . Ok . Tough . Babe . Don 't let the teacher push you around . Is that it ? Oh ! Yeah , and never put your mouth directly on the drinking fountain . But that 's how I drink from the fountain . Not at school . Ok . Well ... here I go . Oh , uh , aren 't you forgetting something ? I 'm sorry . No ! The snack ! Great show , peter . You killed out there . Eh , not as good as the show in branson , but , uh , I 'll cash the check . Peter Connelly ! Eh , what happened to the redhead from the second row ? She 's outside . Give her a t-shirt and send her home . Peter , I 'm so sorry to burst in on you like this , but I just couldn 't control myself . Eh ! Boys ! Why don 't you take a walk , and see if you can find some of those menthol cigarettes I like so much , eh ? Eh ! Eh ! So ... where should we begin , me not-so-wee lass ? Well , why don 't you tell me ? You strike me as a lady who knows ... What she wants . Well , peter ... You know what I want right now more than anything in the world ? Tell me , buttercup . Coffee . Coffee ? Yeah . You know , I want to be wide awake in case we go for a ride on the old tour bus . Eh ! Well , then , by all means , lass , let us ... LATTÃ© ! What would you like ? I 'll have a cappuccino . Root beer . Ohh . What ? It 's not what Don would order . Don would order a mocha . Fine . I 'll have a mocha . Don would order it with gusto . I 'll have a mocha . That 's too much gusto . Well , how would Don say , " get bent " ? He 'd say it . By going out to eat chicken wings with his friend Ernie and leaving me in the lurch ! Hey , what about the check here ? No wonder you don 't have any friends . What 's your problem ? I 'm sorry . Save it . Don 't ever let it happen again . You bumped into me . I think I know that ! Is this seat taken ? No . Please sit down . So ... what brings you in here , pretty lady ? Err .. have a seat right over there , honey , and I 'll be right back , Ok ? Don 't make me come and git ya ! Seth ! Sally , you look sexy . What ? In a very stereotypical kind of way that does nothing for me . Seth , look what I brought you . What ? It 's the head of the monster himself , Peter Connelly . Peter Connelly ? Is he here right now ? Yeah . Well , let him have it . Come on . Peter Connelly . Yes ? Yes ? Oh , my god , can I have your autograph ? What happened out there ? That wasn 't the Seth I know ! Sally , please ! I was mocking Connelly . He signed your shoes . Yeah . The shoes of a man who hates him . Ha hah ! I don 't believe this . You 're a fraud ! Sally , the whole culture here 's a fraud . I 'm a fraud , you 're a fraud , life 's a fraud . Yes , but you in particular are a complete fraud ! God , when I think of what I gave up for you . I mean , my family , my self-respect , my hair-care regimen ! OK , relax . You 're being stupid . That 's the wrong thing to say . Jig on outta here , loser ! Get out ! So he says , " they 're not Teflon bullets . They 're dum-dums . " They 're Dum-Dums . Don . Dick , what are you doing here ? I was under the impression this was our place , Don . I guess I was wrong . And who might you be , Ernie ? Ernie . So this is who you choose ? Choose ? Choose to hurt me with . Uh , Ernie 's a friend of mine from the academy . So tell me , Don , what is it he has that I don 't ? A leaf blower ? Well , I 'll tell you what , Mr. Don Orville ! When you decide what it is you want from this relationship , why don 't you just let me know , hmm ? Oh , and one more thing : you 're a lousy dancer ! I-I 'm sorry , Ernie . I don 't know what to say . It 's Ok , Don . I understand . I 'm gay , too . I 'm not gay . Oh . Well , me neither . I just didn 't want you to feel uncomfortable . " The boy goes to the store . " Harry . Would you like to diagram the sentence ? Well , you 're the one with the chalk . Knock yourself out . I 'd really appreciate it if you 'd give it a try . Well , look , if you want your butt kissed , why don 't you call on Mrs. DeGuzman ? Man , just diagram the damn sentence . Well , back off , buddy . Maybe I don 't know how to diagram the damn sentence . You ever stop to think of that ? That 's Ok , Harry . If you had all the answers , you wouldn 't need to be here . What 's your point , teach ? Well , my point is we 're all here to learn together . We are ? Yes . Are you sure ? I 'm sure . I wanna learn ! I wanna learn ! Dick , do you mind ? ! I have work to do . Oh , I 'm sorry . I was just sitting here thinking what a lonely shambles my life has become . I don 't have any friends . And you know why ? Because I devoted all my time to my relationship with you . Finger-pointing is not going to solve your problems . I 'm not finger-pointing . But it 's your fault ! You ! You wouldn 't come with me to king of the jig ! I had to replace you with Don , and now he won 't even speak to me . Hey , Dick . Don . So ... Look . Hey . Yeah . Yeah . Last night ? No biggie . Cool . So ... burger ? Fries ? Later ? Sure . Solid . That 's my main man . Ohh , it is such a relief to be rid of Seth . So you can get back together with Don ? No . So I can shave the poodles from under my arms . Smooth . Hands off , pervert ! You know , Sally , you may have lost a boyfriend and I may have found a friend , but you know what 's the most important thing ? What ? That I found a friend . all yours .

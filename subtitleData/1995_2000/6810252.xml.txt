 Let 's get this show on the road . Federal agents ! Get down ! Turn this thing off . - You 're Pusher , I presume . - You must be Frank Burst . You know , I gotta tell ya . You got the greatest name . Agent Collins , read him his rights . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you . - Think you can hold me ? - I want him in leg irons ! I want him in a car with a cage ! I 'll ride shotgun . It 'd really help me out if you gave us your name . Pusher 's good enough . You know , Deputy , your uniform is really the most soothing shade of blue . I 'm not kidding you . I notice those things . It 's a sky blue . Very calming . Very ... tranquil . I think the word for that particular shade is cerulean , actually . - Cerulean blue . - OK , OK , we get it . It 's a nice shade of blue . Cerulean blue . Cerulean makes me think of a breeze . - A gentle breeze . - Hey , Mr Blackwell . Put a sock in it . Cerulean is a gentle breeze . Cerulean . A gentle breeze . Stop ! When the truck hit us I was knocked unconscious . Deputy Scott Kerber was mortally injured . Before he succumbed , he managed to pull himself out of the car , dig out his keys ... And his last breath was spent unlocking my prisoner , ... .. who , despite his own injuries , managed to escape on foot . Calls himself " Pusher " . - What 's his story ? - He cold-called me about a month ago . Confessed to a series of contract killings going back over two years . - He wanted to turn himself in ? - No . It was a game . He was bragging . The thing about these murders is , nobody considers them murders . They went down in the books as suicides . - So you think he was just a crank ? - No . He knows too much about each case . Too many details that were only in the police reports . What link did this dead deputy have with him ? None , as far as I can tell . Kerber was a good cop . Then why did he free him ? Pusher kept rambling about cerulean blue , ... .. kept saying how it reminded him of a breeze or somethin ' . " Cerulean blue is like a gentle breeze . " Over and over . And then Kerber pulled into the truck and ... blammo . So you think Pusher somehow talked him into doing this , willed him into doing that ? Willed him ? How ? No kiddin ' . How ? Your guess is as good as mine on this one . See , Pusher likes to leave clues . - Ro nin . - Ronin . It 's a samurai without a master . - You never saw Yojimbo ? - Still , what does it mean ? It means I bet I know what he 's got stacked on the back of his toilet . Agents ? Here 's volume ten . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't help noticing . I was in Georgetown this weekend . A guy knocked me down , stole my purse . - They get him ? - Do they ever ? No offence . 'Scuse me . I 'm still not sure what we 're looking for . Samurais without masters have to advertise . Yes , but advertise for what ? I mean ... How did this Pusher convince an otherwise honest deputy sheriff to free him ? - I 'm sure you have a theory . - Suggestion is a powerful force . The science of hypnosis is predicated on it , as are TV commercials . They 're made to plant thoughts in your head . Inducing someone to buy a hair colour isn 't like inducing them to drive in front of a truck . But the mechanism is the same . It 's just a lot more powerful in this case . This guy calls himself Pusher . Couldn 't that mean he pushes his will onto other people ? Even if he could , why would he cause an accident when he himself was in the car ? Maybe he really didn 't wanna go to jail . Look at this . " I solve problems . OSU . " OSU . Ohio State University ? No , it 's a Virginia code . I 've seen this ad in all these magazines dating back to April 1994 . The time span of the murders . OSU . OS ... .. U. Jeez ! Osu . It 's a Japanese word . It means " to push " . I say we run down those telephone numbers . - Hey . - I think you drooled on me . - Sorry . - What time is it ? - It 's , uh ... twenty to three . - No luck , I take it ? - No , nothing at any of the payphones . Burst is beginning to think it 's a wild-goose chase . Hello ? Are you two just gonna sit there all night ? Don 't bother hunting around for me . I 'm far away . - They 're on the trace . - I was watching you up until an hour ago . You and your pretty partner seem awfully close . - Do you work well together ? - Who is this ? - What 's your name ? - Sorry , G-man . It 's not that easy . You have to follow my little breadcrumb trail . Prove your worth . So far you 're doin ' all right . Why do I have to prove my worth to you ? Do you think this is a game ? What , do you want to be found ? - All right , where 's my next breadcrumb ? - Right in front of you . Let your fingers do the walking , G-man . - Sorry , we didn 't get him . - OK . Not a complete trace . They think he was using a digital scrambler . - " Let your fingers do the walking . " - Phone book . What if Pusher was the last person to use this phone ? Can you redial on these phones ? Hang on a second . - Murphy . - Yeah , it 's me again . We want the last number dialled out from this location . Just ring it on through . - OK . - OK . Hi ! You 've reached Tee-Totalers golf driving range and pro shop . Our hours of operation are 7am to midnight Monday through Saturday ... .. and 7am to 10pm on Sunday . - So he 's a killer and a golfer . - Rings a bell , huh ? Let 's go , G-woman . Oh , yeah ! Strong shot . Good shot . Woo-hoo ! All right , gentlemen . I 'm usin ' this non-sanctioned ball . It 's got a core of uranium - or some damn thing . I don 't know what . Gets up there like Sputnik . Yeah ! About time . Konnichiwa , gentlemen . I was never here . - Police ! Get down ! - Whoa ! OK . OK . OK , relax . Relax . Let me see your face . Take it easy . Come on . That 's right . That 's right . Hey , Collins . Listen . I need you to do somethin ' for me . Will you do somethin ' for me ? Mulder . Collins ? What the hell ... ? What the hell are you doin ' ? Collins , let it go . Stop me ! Collins ! Put that down . Light up , light up . Come in . This is Burst . Get a burn unit over here . Collins is down . Bad . Yeah , real bad . I don 't know what happened . Get over here ! - Get somebody over here . Now ! Collins , it 's all right . - Federal agent ! - Light up . Light , light . Light up . Bet you five bucks I get off . Rise and state your name and address for the court . Robert Patrick Modell , ... .. 3083 Roseneath Avenue , Apartment 9 , Alexandria , Virginia . Agent Mulder , does the FBI believe that this defendant is responsible for 14 murders ? That is correct , Your Honour . Well , in each of the cases the coroner 's office ruled suicide . We believe that they were indeed murders , Your Honour . You believe ? But do you have any actionable evidence ? We have the defendant on tape confessing to the murders on several occasions . He identifies them as such , and knows crime scene details only available to the police . One of these so-called murder victims threw herself under a commuter train . This was a crowded platform . 100 witnesses . Nobody pushed her . No one was within 30 feet of her . - But your client was present . - Which is how he knew the details . - Make your point . - I believe that these people died ... .. because it was the defendant 's express will that they do so . His will ? This man admitted to being a killer for hire . He has a unique suggestive ability which makes for the perfect MO . He can talk his victims into injuring themselves . - I can 't believe this ! - Could you run that by me one more time ? Yesterday a law-enforcement officer was induced to self-immolation by the defendant . I witnessed it . All these other officers witnessed it . - We have his confession . All we 're ask ... - Your Honour , ... .. the evidence chain for this case has been difficult to establish . We 're asking indulgence to complete our investigation . We 'd like to have Mr Modell held for trial based on his taped confession . What about this audio tape , Mr Modell ? - Did you confess to 14 murders ? - Keep it simple . Unfortunately , yes , Your Honour . Not that I remember any of it . This was basically a drunken phone prank on the part of my client , Your Honour . A phone prank ? He had the details of every case , Your Honour . And Robert deeply regrets the distress and confusion this situation has caused . Do you deny these charges ? Absolutely , Your Honour . I 'm not guilty . Thank you very much . Would you excuse me for a minute ? I believe you owe me five dollars . Hey , your shoe 's untied . Made you look . How do you do it ? Hey , Modell . I know your name now . I know where you live ! I dug up a few more things under " Modell " . Let me guess . He was an average student , he did an average stint in the military . - Which branch ? - Not his first choice . He wanted to be a navy SEAL and then he wanted to be an army Green Beret . He washed out of both - though not for lack of intelligence . He ended up as a supply clerk at Fort Bragg . Served two years , general discharge . Did you know he applied to the FBI ? Didn 't come close to passing the psych screening . - You got a copy of that ? - Yeah . They found him to be " acutely ego-centred " . " He has no regard for the feelings of others , perceiving people as objects . " " He is extremely suspicious of government and authority . " Yet he wants to be in authority . The screener caught him in a dozen self-aggrandising lies , ... .. saying that he was a master of martial arts and had been trained by ninjas in Japan . Ninjas are said to have the ability to cloud the minds of their opponents . Are we talking kung fu movies ? He certainly clouded the mind of that judge . Even if he could , he didn 't need to . We barely had a case . We had enough to get past a simple preliminary hearing . Modell put the whammy on him . Please explain the scientific nature of the whammy . I don 't know . Maybe it 's some mental aspect of some martial art , ... .. the suppression of the brain 's chemistry produced by a cadence in Modell 's voice . - His voice seems to be the key . - Modell 's last known employment ... .. was as a convenience-store clerk . He has never been trained by ninjas . He has never even been out of the US . He is just a little man who wishes that he were someone big . And we 're feeding that wish . That failed psych screening - if Modell could actually control people 's minds , he 'd be an FBI agent , right ? He 'd be a Green Beret , a navy SEAL . Maybe the ability came to him more recently , like in the last two years . Well , OK . What 's your big theory ? How do you explain what Agent Collins did ? This is a sane man , a family man with no history of psychological problems ... Sets himself on fire . How does that happen ? What do you need me to say ? That I believe that Modell is guilty of murder ? I do . I 'm just looking for an explanation a little more mundane than the whammy . He 's laughing at us , Scully . Excuse me . Where might I find the computer records section ? Fourth floor . West wing . Thank you very much . Can I help you ? I need to know some things , ... .. Holly . Great . Just , uh ... let me have the keyboard for a minute . I 'd love a printout of this . And a cup of coffee , when you get a chance . I wish I could get my hands on the guy that did that to you . I 'd make him pay . - Can I help you ? - No . No , thanks . We 're , uh ... We 're just fine . Look , we 're in the middle of something here , so ... - Who are you and what are you doin ' here ? - Take a walk , Mel Cooley ! - Let me go . Just let me go ! - Shut up ! Holly , call Security . Holly ... he 's the one . He 's the one who mugged you . Holly , call Security now ! - Make him stop hurtin ' me , Holly . - Shut up ! Holly , now ! - Holly ... - Holly ! - Security . - I 've got a situation . Fourth floor . God ! Hurt him back . Sir ... I 'm so terribly , terribly sorry . I don 't know why I ... God . I 'm so sorry . All right , let 's hit the bricks , huh ? Holly , can you tell us anything more that might help us understand ... .. why you attacked Assistant Director Skinner ? It 's like suddenly I was watching myself from across the room . Doing ... these things . It 's like he was with me , inside my head . Modell ? - That 's the only way I know how to put it . - Excuse me , sir . - Can we speak outside ? - Yeah . Sure . Uh ... Holly , excuse us for a minute , please . The building security tapes show Modell clearly entering and leaving unnoticed . He had the word " Pass " on his lapel . The guards that waved him by don 't even remember him . And this mysterious phenomenon is why I have a size-seven heel mark on my face ? I have to agree with Agent Mulder , sir . I can 't even begin to explain how , but I think Modell is responsible for your injuries . - Why is this guy so interested in you ? - What do you mean ? He left with one file : yours . He didn 't access any others . - Now he knows where you live . - And you know where he lives . Pick him up . For what ? About the only thing we got on him now is criminal trespass . That 's enough for a warrant . Police ! Police ! Modell ! - Lights coming on ! - Look me right in the eyes . Right in the eyes . No , please . Let me go . Svengali . No ... - All clear . No one 's home . - Search the whole building . Nearby buildings too . He likes to watch from a distance . Check the place out and I 'll talk to the neighbours . Hey , Scully , check this out . Mango Kiwi Tropical Swirl . Now we know we 're dealin ' with a madman . Is there anything else you can tell me ? Yeah ? Yeah , when does it date to ? Right . Thank you very much . - Tegretol . - What 's that ? It 's to relieve Modell 's seizures . He has temporal lobe epilepsy . His doctor 's office wouldn 't give me much over the phone . Just that that prescription dates back to April 1994 . What causes epilepsy this late in life ? A head injury , neurological disease , a brain tumour or lesion ... A tumour ? The growth of brain tumours has been linked with psychic ability . - Those reports are unsubstantiated . - Just bear with me for a second . What if Modell 's suggestive ability is really a form of psychokinesis ? - Brought on by the tumour ? - It fits . All those protein drinks . He 's gotta replenish the metabolic energy he uses in controlling somebody 's will . Mulder , more to the point , if Modell did have a brain tumour , ... .. the effects on his health would be more acute . He simply wouldn 't be well enough to play these games with us . Maybe he isn 't . Maybe that 's the whole point . - What ? - His exhaustion at the range . He didn 't let us capture him . He was too sick to escape , too wiped out . Why would such a proficient killer confess to murders he 'd already gotten away with ? - Maybe he 's dying . - And he wants to go out in a blaze of glory . - Not with a whimper , but a bang . Get the tracing gear . - Hello ? - Hey , hey , hey . Whaddaya say ? What 's up , Modell ? How you doin ' ? Long time no see . Told you I know where you live . Nice apartment . Who does your decorating , the Grinch that stole Christmas ? Agent Frank Burst . The guy with the great name . Say , Frank , are Agents Mulder and Scully there ? - Yeah , we 're here . - Perfect . Frank , how much do you weigh ? - Excuse me ? - About how much do you weigh ? Anything to keep you talking , you ... I don 't know , about 190 , 195 . Ha ! 215 if you 're a day . You 're totally the wrong weight for your height . No offence , but you 're built like a fireplug . And I got stubby little legs to kick you in the ass . You goin ' somewhere with this ? It 's just that it can 't be healthy . And you look like you 're a smoker . You probably take a drink now and then . You eat greasy fried foods . Sausage , bacon ... - Frank ... - Onion rings that stain the cardboard . And I 'm guessin you shake on that salt like a maraca ! Frank . Frank , hang up the phone . What are you talkin ' about ? What 's your point ? You know what that 's doing to your arteries . - Terrible things , Frank . - Frank ... Waxy , yellow chunks of plaque are tumbling through your bloodstream , ... .. sticking like glue to your arterial walls , ... - Hang up the phone . - .. squeezing shut your aorta . - Can you feel it ? - Come on . - Can you feel your aorta ... - Hang up the phone ! - Back off ! - .. squeezing shut ? - All those miles of ... - Hang up ! I said back off ! - Hang it up ! - Finish the trace ! - Mulder ... - Hang up the phone ! .. medical condition called pachyemia ? It 's when the blood thickens up in your veins like strawberryjam . - Finish the trace ! - Frank , hang it up ! - Hang up ! - Your heart flatlines . Beeeep ... Frank ! You die , Frank . Frank ? Yo , Frank ! No pulse . Get an ambulance . We need an ambulance to 3083 Roseneath Avenue . Possible cardiac arrest . - Modell ? - Hey . Mulder . How 's Frankie-boy ? What is it , Modell , really , that you want ? A worthy adversary . It 's obviously not that fat lump lying ' at your feet . Now I 'm hopin ' it 's you . Why me ? I 've read all about you . You 're a top criminal profiler . Oxford University grad . All-round bright young man . You know what makes guys like me tick , right ? You think you see right through old Bob Modell . Sick old Bob Modell , right ? You 're dying , aren 't you , Bob ? What , do you want to take a few innocent people with you before you go ? Biology tell us we 're all dying ' . And original sin tells me ain 't nobody innocent . Some are more innocent than others . Why not just tell me where you are ? Oh , what ... you want the phone number ? Sure . Just , uh ... It 's 555-0197 . You know , it 's just a payphone . In two minutes I 'll be gone . You mean you killed this man for nothing , you sick bastard ? Me ? No , haven 't you caught on , Mulder ? They all kill themselves . - Where 's Modell calling from ? - A gas-station parking lot . 12,000 block , Chain Bridge Road . It 's a payphone . Just like he said . Fairfax Mercy Hospital 's right down the street from there , huh ? Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy . Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy . He must need regular treatment , Mulder . Let 's go find out . We got a visual flat on the door . Come on up . Here they go . We found Modell 's car . Engine 's still warm . He 's probably in the building . All entrances covered . Do we hold or go in ? - Hold . - All right , thank you . - Hold . - Roger . The outpatient office says Modell is scheduled for a 2.30 MRI . That 's right now . - How do you wanna play this ? - I think I should go in alone . - Why ? - My team can flush him out . What if he turns one of your men against the others ? In a crowded hospital ? I think we should give him what he wants . You . We stand a better chance if we 're separated . I 'll go in miked . That way you 'll know what he 's doin ' , where he is at all times . - You got a radio , to keep my hands free ? - I got just what you need . Two-lux video camera . It 'll practically see in the dark . It 's designed for bomb disposal works , keeping only officer at risk . See ? Think I get the Playboy Channel ? Smile , Scully . - Take it . - No . I wouldn 't want to end up pointing it at anybody except Modell . Let 's get this show on the road . Federal agent . Go about your business as usual . Scully , do you read me ? I 'm with you , Mulder . Nothing out of the ordinary . - SWAT team , hold outside . - SWAT team still holding . - Mulder ! - Two shots fired . - SWAT team ! Not yet . Everybody keep moving . Federal agent ! - Let me see what the hell 's goin ' on . - I 'm losing you . Mulder . Agent Mulder ! Wait . Agent Scully . You getting this back there ? What happened ? Looks like the guard shot the technician , then he shot himself . His gun is missing . Tell your men Modell may be heading your way . SWAT team . Suspect is armed and may be making his way out of the building . - We copy . - Shooters in place Mulder , wait . Get closer to the computer monitor . - Over here ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Right there . There . That light mass in his temporal lobe . - Right here ? - You were right , Mulder . Now check around you . Modell 's chart should be somewhere around there . We 're batting ' a thousand , Scully . Modell 's dying . He 's got nothin ' to lose . Mulder , just get out of there . Go . Mulder ? Mulder ! God ! We think they 're three doors down . There 's six critical-care rooms we can 't get to . If we gas the halls , we might kill those patients . Why do we keep givin ' this guy exactly what he wants ? Just wait for a signal from me . We 're clear . Mulder . Thanks for joining us . We 've got a dozen law-enforcement officers outside in the hall . Another 30 in the parking lot . Regular convention . So whatever you 've got planned , it 's not gonna work out the way you want it to . You don 't know what I got planned . Two warriors of equal skill fight to the death . One is a student of Japanese budo : the way of war . Budo teaches the warrior to leave himself outside the battle . In other words , to disregard his own death . Because of that , the budo warrior always wins . I am that warrior . I don 't fear my death . So I ... I 'm gonna give you ... .. one pull of the trigger against me . One in six chance . One . One pull . Wait . Mulder , look . There 's pure oxygen in this room . There 's no telling what could happen if you pull that trigger ... Piece of cake . Your turn . - Mulder , no . - Mulder , yes . - Go . - Mulder , listen to me . Give me the gun . We can stop this thing now . You and I can just walk outside of this room ... No ! Damn you ! You bastard ! Mulder , hand me the gu ... Mulder , you don 't have to do this . - You 're stronger than this . - Your turn , Scully . Gotta play by the rules . - Pull the trigger , Mulder . - Mulder , fight him . You can fight this . Come on ! Pull the trigger , Mulder . She shot you . I read it in her files . Payback time . Shoot the little spy ! I 'm gonna kill you , Modell . Pull the trigger and get another crack at me . Scully , run ! Scully ... Federal agents ! Get down , get down , get down ! There 's no telling how long he 'll hang on , ... .. but he 'll never regain consciousness . You know , we thought he was undergoing treatment . We were wrong . - What do you mean ? - Read his chart . The MRIs were gauging how much life he had left , but he consistently refused treatment . The tumour was operable right up to the end , but he refused to have it removed . - Why ? - I think it 's like you said . He was always such a ... little man . This was finally something that made him feel big . I say we don 't let him take up another minute of our time . Visiontext Subtitles : Paul Sofer I made this !

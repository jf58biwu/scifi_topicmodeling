Professor Klump . The cages . What happened ? That is most peculiar , Jason , because I distinctly remember locking up last night . I locked these cages , picked up my portfolio and turned around ... ( STUDENTS GASPING AND CHATTERING ) Oh . I must 've grazed the switch . Shelley 's the only one that didn 't get out . Good. I 'll tend to Shelley . You students take care of this . Excuse me . Hello , Shelley . How are you today , my little powder puff ? Yeah . Yeah . ( MURMURING BABY TALK ) Sir ? You may want to look at the latest test results . I 'm not sure if I 'm reading them correctly . She 's lost three ounces since the last feed ? Must be some kind of mistake . ( KEYBOARD KEYS CLICKING ) No , no , Jason . Her entire molecular structure has been realigned . We 've done it . This new formula 's working . It 's actually reconstructed Shelley 's DNA . She lost 20 % of her body fat in one feeding . What if we upped the dosage ? No , one step at a time . We don 't want to jeopardize Shelley . We 'll keep the feedings as scheduled . Okay . Schedule . Excuse me . I 'm very late . Students , we got a lot of work to do and don 't have much time to do it in . Trying to win a grant here . So , as Arsenio used to say , " Let 's get busy ! " ( SWITCHES LEVER ) ( STUDENTS CHATTERING ) ( RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING ) ( CLEARS THROAT AND GRUNTS ) ( EXHALES SLOWLY ) Comfy ? Quite . Anything I can get for you ? Juice ? Coffee ? Rack of lamb ? No , sir , I 'm fine . ( SNIFFS ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) You did want to see me about something , didn 't you , sir ? Well , Professor Klump , allow me to answer that question by posing another . Why are you trying to destroy my school ? Beg your pardon , sir ? Do you know who Louise Vindovik is ? Oh , surely , sir . She 's a lovely woman who so generously donates money to help fund our science department . Close . Very close . But wrong . See , she was a lovely woman , and she used to fund our science department . That was before she was hospitalized for nearly swallowing a gerbil . Not gerbil , sir . A hamster . Gerbils are more streamlined and hamsters have a tendency to be fluffier . The male hamster 's scrotum has a tendency to be disproportionately ... Never mind . Those National Rifle people are right . If I had one now ... bang . Sir , I 'd like to concentrate on the positives . What Miss Vindovik witnessed was 5,000 healthy hamsters bred from a genetically deficient hereditary line . It 's actually very exciting . Do I look excited , Klump ? No , you don 't look excited at all . But maybe you might be holding it in , your excitement , not wanting to express it . Now listen to me carefully , you fat tub of goo . For years you 've single-handedly alienated every wealthy donor we 've had . Air-conditioning schools are outdrawing us ! We 've lost so much money , red is our school color . lnner-city schools have better computers than we do . Bosnia wants to give us money ! I 'm going to set up a meeting with Harlan Hartley ... Klump ! Are you listening ? Yes , sir . Yes . Hartley is the last rich alumnus we 've got . And he 's a science fan . And he 's considering donating a $ 10 million grant to this school . And I want that money , Klump . Yourjob depends upon it . I 'll let you know how to handle it , since I 'll be watching you . Now go . But , sir , I don 't know if you should ... See , right back there , just before you said " But , sir " right there ? That was the end of the meeting . Well , I guess I 'll leave . You have a pleasant day . Grace , the cream has turned again . ( GASPS ) PROFESSOR : Of all the equations you 'll learn during the course of your studies here , this equation shall be , I promise you , the most helpful throughout the course of your studies , because this equation fundamentally breaks down what DNA is composed of , and what components of DNA ...

You can sew up your stomach and your asshole , you gonna always be fat . All I 'm trying to say is scientific breakthroughs are occurring all the time ... The only thing about to break through is your ass through the seat of your pants . Sherman , I think I do remember hearing something on TV about colon cleansing . They say everyone should have one . I 'm thinking about getting me an appointment and getting my colon cleansed thoroughly . You want your colon cleansed ? I 'm gonna clean mine . ( LOUD FART ) There . Now my colon is clean . Squeaky clean . Every time we have a meal , you break gas . Don 't break gas and destroy our meal . You the one that brought up colon cleansing ! I did not say anything about breaking gas ! You can talk about putting a tube in somebody 's ass , but I can 't break wind . I didn 't say nothing about putting a hose up nobody 's ass ... What you think a colonic is ? You think you run your asshole by the car wash ? You 're choking the baby . As long as I pay the bills , I do what I want at this table . Case in point : ( LOUD FART ) Who that called my name ?

I was wondering if he was all right after everything that happened at the club the other night . Oh , Miss Purty , it tore his chunky ass up . It 's strange that a man as intelligent as Sherman has no confidence whatsoever . Makes me sick sometimes to think ... I 'm always telling the man , " Sherman , no matter what , you 've got to strut . " You got to suck in your gut and strut . " Me , personally , I don 't have that problem . Doesn 't seem like you do . You 're just too feisty and too fine . Me and you need to hook up . We need to go to The Scream tonight , have a couple of drinks and strut our respective stuff together . I don 't even know your name . Hey , buddy , what the hell happened here ? See ? Everybody knows Buddy . The professor must have got a little carried away last night .

I 've forgotten about that . You forget , too . That 's over . Go have a nice day . There 's something else . I met a friend of yours in your lab . Buddy Love . Buddy Love . He 's quite a character , huh ? He asked me out , and he said it was your idea . Oh , did he ? Well , I know you 're new in town . I thought it would be nice for a new girl to get out , meet some people . Did you find him attractive ? Honestly , yes . He 's very handsome and athletic . But I don 't feel comfortable talking to you about that . You can talk to me about anything . I want you to . And I think you should definitely go out with Buddy Love . You do ? Absolutely . I don 't think there 's anything wrong with two young people getting together and having a good time . So by all means , do just that . You sure you 're all right with that ? Don 't worry about me .

Hey , don 't let the tears fool you . I 'm a tooth chipper . Six T-bones , five baked potatoes and two servings of creamed spinach . I have never seen anyone eat so much . You are so lucky to stay so thin . Luck has nothing to do with it . It 's a matter of recombinant ribonucleic acids unzipped by a radioactive guanine peptide . What does that mean ? I don 't know. I 'm trying to sound extra intelligent . Got you ! You gonna eat that ? Guess who 's back in the house . From Def Comedy Jam , my man , Reggie Warrington . Give it up ! ( CHEERING ) I hate this guy . I hate this guy . He is so obnoxious . Give the nigger a chance . JAMES BROWN : ( SINGING ) Watch me lt 's your world , dog ! I 'm just a squirrel trying to get a nut .

You cannot stop a woman from shopping . ( LAUGHING ) Let 's see what I got in the house tonight . Oh , now , look at this white guy right here . You cannot tell me he ain 't got a small jimmie . Man , it 's so small he needs tweezers to take a piss . He needs tweezers to take a piss ! Tweezers on his dick ! Reggie 's hot tonight . Look at this . Look at this . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I can 't breathe ! Excuse me , brother . ( GASPING ) I can 't breathe ! Okay . Brother , man ! ( WHEEZING ) You almost killed me , man ! I had to give myself the Heimlich . You mind waiting for the punch line first , brother ? I 'm sorry . You 're so funny . You 're so funny the way you take a person 's personal defects and flip it around . Like you pick somebody in the room and say , " Look at your foot , " and everybody look at it and start laughing . That 's funny shit . You 're on your way ! You going to the top ! You 're the next Lenny Bruce ! Why , thank you . Thank you very much . That 's genius . That 'd even work with me doing it to you . If I say , look at Reggie 's gums and teeth . His mother had an affair with Mister Ed . See ? Everybody 's laughing . They can visualize your mother in a barn with Mister Ed . ( NEIGHING LUSTILY ) Look what I 'm doing , Wilbur . Look at me ! You snapping on me ? Are you snapping on Reggie ? It 's your teeth , Reggie . I don 't know whether to smile at you or kick a field goal . Hey , Reggie ! It 's good ! It 's all good ! And , man , what 's wrong with that breath ? I can smell it over here . Reggie , your breath is so stink , people look forward to your farts . Breath smell like shit . Do you smell shit ? I smell shit . Oh ! Oh ! You done did it now , boy . I wasn 't gonna say nothing 'cause I like black people . But it 's time to attack black . That 's right . The glove 's coming off . Don 't hurt me now ! Maybe it 's time for Reggie to lay into your mama . ( CROWD CHEERS ) Oh ! Oh , yeah ! Maybe it 's time for Reggie to talk about your mama a little bit . You 're the man , Reggie ! Your mother 's so fat , she went to Sizzler 's , and the bitch got a group discount . ( AUDIENCE LAUGHING ) ( HYSTERICAL LAUGHING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) ( SCREAMING AND GASPING ) Okay , fat jokes ! You want to do fat jokes ? All right . Your mother 's so fat , the bitch need a Thomas Guide to find her asshole ! ( AUDIENCE LAUGHING ) All right ! Wait , wait , wait . Your mother 's so fat , after sex I rolled over twice , and I 'm still on the bitch ! ( LAUGHING CONTINUES ) Your mother is so fat , she fell in the Grand Canyon and got stuck ! Reggie 's mama 's so fat , that the bitch gets her toenails painted at Earl Scheib ! Earl Scheib ! Earl Scheib ! Hey , hey , get off the stage , man . You ain 't in show business . Reggie 's mama is so fat , her blood type is Rocky Road ! Isn 't that something ? Reggie 's mother is so fat , her belt size is equator ! ( HOOTING AND CHEERING ) Get it ? Equator ? ( BUDDY LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ) Let 's get a big round of applause for Reggie 's mama 's ass that brought us so much joy tonight . Yeah ! That 's a big ass . Enough ! Silence ! I can 't take this shit no more . Now , you done talked about me enough , boy ! I tried to be peaceful , but now it 's time for Reggie to karatasize your ass ! ( WHOOPS ) Oh , yeah . ( LAUGHING ) Oh , Reggie , I heard of dreadlocks , but shitlocks ? That 's not your hair . Take that pile of shit off your head . ( AUDIENCE LAUGHING ) You ... You go too far with the comedy . ( KARATE YELL ) Oh , oh ! Come on ! Come on . What 's that ? Oh , yeah , it 's my style , boy . You didn 't know Reggie studied . What style is that ? This is called " Kick-Your-Ass Style , " boy .

( AUDIENCE GASPS ) Ladies and gentlemen , me and Reggie want to send one out to a very special lady in the house tonight . ( PIANO PLAYING ) ( SINGING ) Lovin ' you is easy , 'cause you 're beautiful Do-un-do-un-doo-doo . Reggie ? ( BONES CRACK ) ( HOWLING ) Let go . That was pretty . Ladies and gentlemen , Reggie has left the building . Thank you , and good night . ( CHEERING ) Oh , stop it ! Stop it ! Now , thank you so much . Thank you . Thank you so ... Oh , please , please , come on now . Hey , who pinched my ass ? Cut it out . That 's good . All right . Thank you . Can you get the bill for me ? Thanks , man . Too much ! That was amazing . I can 't believe you did that . Amazing is my middle name . I only wish Professor Klump was here to have seen it . Listen . This is our moment . I don 't wanna ruin it with talks of Sherman . You know , your eyes , there 's something very familiar about them , as if I already know you . You know , I feel the exact same way about you , Miss Purty . ( BALLAD PLAYING ON SOUND SYSTEM ) Miss Purty , let me tell you . ( lN PROFESSOR 'S VOICE ) That kiss was probably the most wonderful kiss I 've ever ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) What I meant to say was that ... Your lip . What ? Your lip is swollen . My lip ? Yes . Oh , my lip ? Oh . That happens every time I ... What kind of lipstick do you have on ? Chanel . That happens every time I have Chanel lipstick on my lips . An allergic reaction . ( RUMBLING ) Oh. lt 's giving me gas , too . You have to go catch a cab . I gotta go to the drugstore and get some Benadryl and Kaopectate . Excuse me , have a pleasant evening . Bye , bye ! Buddy ! Buddy , wait ! ( MUSIC CONTINUES ) Oh , man . Hey , Professor Klump is here ? Yeah . Where is he ? There he is , right there . That guy gave you this credit card ? Yup . That 's not Professor Klump . That 's not his credit card . Hey ! What ? Hey ! Hey ! Okay , fella , what are you doing with the Professor 's credit card ? Where 'd you get it ? I 'm sorry . Perhaps you need the money more than I thought ... ( JASON GROANS ) JASON : ( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God ! ( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God ! That 's a bus ! You 're gonna kill us , man ! What the hell is the matter ... Oh , man ! This is Freddy Krueger shit , man ! Professor ? Hello , Jason . JASON : ( SCREAMING ) What 's happening ? ( SIREN WAILING ) First time we had to use one of these without an accident . The class left 20 minutes ago . Dean Richmond ! Oh , hello , sir . You caught me in the middle of an experiment I was doing . I was trying to see how the students would respond to a teacher-less environment . Teacher-less environment ? New field of research for you ? Yes , sir . Interesting . Always thinking . That 's good , Klump . Let me know your results . Would you mind explaining this ? Oh ! Yeah , well , my car 's in the shop , so ... So you put a $ 47,000 luxury car on your faculty account . Initially , I ... I requested a Yugo , and this is all they had ... lf it 's all they had , it 's all they had . After all , men like us can 't walk around now , can we ? ( CHUCKLING ) Come on . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Oh , well , well . I 'm glad you 're taking it like that , sir . I thought you was gonna get angry and start screaming and hollering , and maybe even fire me . ( LAUGHING ) Whoo ! Oh , Sherman , Sherman . In the end we know so little of each other , hmm ? No , my friend , I 've got bigger fish to fry . I spoke to Harlan Hartley . He 's offering that tiny trinket that could save your entire research program . Oh , yes . Absolutely . I set up a meeting with him . He wants to hear your grant proposal personally . Friday , the Ritz , dinner , 8 : 00 sharp . Well , sir , I think that 's a wonderful idea , sir . Absolutely . And I promise you , I will not let you down . I know you won 't . I know you 're going to be there and you 're going to be great . In fact , I know you 're going to be perfect . ( LAUGHING ) Do you know how I know ? How 's that ? 'Cause if you 're not perfect , never mind the yelling and the screaming and the firing . If anything goes wrong for any reason , I 'm going to kill you . I don 't mean that as a euphemism. I 'm going to literally kill you . I 'm going to strangle you and choke off your air supply until you pass away . ( EXCLAIMS ) Okay . Till Friday , then . It 's a date . ( SCHOOL BELL RINGING ) Sir , this is incredible . It 's ... It 's a complete metabolic transformation . How did it happen ? Was it an accident ? No , I did it to myself , Jason . You did ? Why ? If it was for the grant , the data with Shelley was already so compelling . Well , I have compelling reasons of my own , Jason . I have a case of infatuation of sorts with Miss Purty . Professor , if you feel this way about Carla , why don 't you tell her ? It 'd be a lot simpler than transforming into ... This guy 's testosterone levels are right off the charts . He was mean last night . It was so unlike you . You know , I did feel that . Sir , you can 't control him . Jason , you have no idea what it feels like to be Buddy Love . It 's indescribable . It 's just wonderful ! The way people talk to him and treat him , and the way she looks at him . But he 's dangerous . He almost killed us last night . We should be concentrating on getting the grant proposal to Harlan Hartley . This is nuts ! I guess you 're right , Jason . I never have behaved like this before . But on the other hand , I 've never been in love before . Ever . Afternoon , Carla . Hi , Sherman . How are you doing today ? Pretty good . I come over to see how things were going with you and Buddy . I wish I knew . We went out last night . It was great . We had such a wonderful time . And then all of a sudden he runs out of the club . He has some allergic reaction . I don 't even know if he 's all right . He 's fine . He told me that his lip swelled up , he put ice on it and the swelling came down . Kinda strange , huh ? Well , did he even ask about me ? Did he say why he didn 't call me and let me know he was all right ? Carla , Buddy 's kind of unreliable . He 's kind of what you call a " here today , gone tomorrow " kind of fellow . Oh , I see . Mmm-hmm . So he had you talk to me because he 's not interested anymore . No , it 's nothing quite like that . Look . I know what it feels like to be brushed off , and it 's okay . This is all my fault . I should 've never encouraged you to go out with Buddy . Sherman , you have been so sweet . I 'll just have to forget about him . I 'll see you later . Carla . I was wondering if I could talk to you about you and I , for a second . I was ... I was wondering what you were doing later , 'cause the family gonna get together . She made a meal and we gonna be eating , so I figured if you not doing anything for dinner , we 'd love to have you , if you want to come over for dinner . We 'd love to have you over for dinner . I 'd love to . Would you , now ? Yes , I would . Should we call and make sure there 's going to be enough food ? I don 't think that 's going to be a problem . ( ALL CHATTERING ) MAMA : There 's nothing like being with family ! GRANDMA : I am hungry . Come on , now . Carla , where are you from ? Chicago . Oh , Chicago ! We have family there . PAPA : Windy city , huh ? I was working on a skyscraper in Chicago once , and my lunch blew off the 27th floor . Yeah , I figure your fat ass would remember somebody 's sandwich flying off a building . ( LOUD BELCH ) Oh , baby , eat some bread . Miss Purty , are you and Sherman having relations ? TOGETHER : That 's a good question . No , Grandma . It 's not like that . We 're colleagues . Oh . PROFESSOR : We just work together . That 's how it start out colleagues . Me and your grandfather was colleagues . Next thing you know he 's on top of me in the shed , pumping and a-sweating . It 's not like that . PAPA : Will you hush up ? He 's never brought a girl home . The least you can do is let us talk to her . Yeah , I 'd like to get to know her a little better myself . Ain 't nothing wrong with having relations . Don 't be ashamed of that . Relations is beautiful . When I was young I used to always have relations . Every night , if a nice gentleman bring me flowers and candy , take me to a movie , show me a lovely evening , then I would take him home and give him hot , lovely relations . Relations is a beautiful thing . It 's nothing to be ashamed of . Especially two young people . That blowhole . Cletus ! Sometimes when I 'm alone , I relate to myself . I can relate . Oh , Mama . I don 't wanna hear this shit while I 'm eating . MAMA : Cletus ! ( WHISPERING ) I 'm gonna kill you later . Carla , do you like children ? Yes . Oh , that 's wonderful . I can 't wait for Sherman to bring me home some grandbabies . ERNIE : I know you 're gonna enjoy making them babies . Got those childbearing hips . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Baby 'll pop right out . ( MAKES POPPING SOUND ) Your family got any money ? I ain 't paying for no big-ass wedding . I know a wonderful minister . What religious background are you ? I still got my wedding dress . If you want it , I 'll take it in . You 'd look so lovely in it . It 's white though . Can you wear a white wedding dress , young lady ? Now , Sherman , you can wear a white tuxedo . 'Cause you know Sherman , ( WHISPERING ) Sherman has never had relations . Mama , you gonna embarrass my baby . GRANDMA : I hope you got a strong back . MAMA : Oh , look at my baby blushing . When you get all that man , and release all that that 's been built up for 35 years . Just wanting and wanting and wanting ! ( EXCLAIMS ) Might make your head blow off . Pop goes the weasel ! I got my own self hot telling that story . Pop goes the weasel , 'cause the weasel say " pop ! " You gonna get married here , or in Chicago ? MAMA : Do you cook ? 'Cause somebody 's got to feed my Sherman . Yeah , I know a wonderful church down there on Main Street , but they won 't marry you if you 're a lesbian . Not that I have anything against lesbians . I love lesbians . Lesbians is cool . There 's nothing wrong with a little bingo . A little cunnilingus ain 't never hurt nobody . Why is it the woman always gets the choice where they 're gonna be married ? Tradition . Tradition , my ass ! I ain 't gonna pay for everybody flying to no Chicago ! You know how much plane tickets cost ? You cheap bastard . PAPA : We 're gonna have to drive down there . I 'm not driving over to Chicago . ( SINGING ) Sherman gonna have relations My baby 's not getting married . ( LOUD FART ) There you go again , popping off gas in front of this lovely young lady . We 're trying to have a meal . Put that brake on this gas . I hope your ass turn into a frog . Don 't nobody want to hear your flatulence , Cletus Klump . ( LOUD FART ) MAMA : You 're such a disgrace ! PAPA : I stopped holding my gas a long time ago . MAMA : You spoiled the dinner ! ( ERNIE JR . LAUGHING ) PAPA : Say one more word . ( CHATTERING CONTINUES ) ( BELL TOLLING ) Listen , Carla , I want to apologize about my family back there . I think they got the wrong idea about things . Oh , no . I should apologize . I 'm so sorry if I seemed distant tonight . I still have Buddy on my mind . You really care for Buddy , huh ? I don 't know . I mean , on the outside , he seems so cocky and brash . But when I look in his eyes , I see kindness , I see warmth . And that 's the side of Buddy I wanted to get to know . I just got way ahead of myself . And here I am , talking your ear off once again about Buddy . No , it 's quite all right , really . Listen , Carla , don 't you worry about Buddy . I 'll find him for you . Thank you , Sherman . Thank you for being such a good friend to me . A good friend . Good night . Good night . ( SIGHS ) ( LOUD CRASHING ) Professor ? is that you ? I just finished the grant proposal . What 's the matter with you ? Never seen a brother wearing a circus tent before ? Black man can 't go camping ? Now , wait a minute , you ... You can 't be you . We agreed that you wouldn 't do this . Someone has to tend to chunky butt 's sex life . Chunky butt is extremely horny . Excuse me . But Professor Klump has a meeting tonight with Harlan Hartley at the Ritz . I 'm gonna be at the Ritz tonight , but it will not be in the interest of science . No ! I can 't let you go . Professor ! If you 're in there and you can hear me , come out ! Professor , listen to me . The testosterone levels are way too high . You can 't control him . ( WHEEZING ) ( GROANING AND MOANING ) Oh ! Jason ! What ? ( GASPING ) lt 's me , Sherman . I 'm talking to you from deep down inside Buddy Love . Listen to me closely . Go in the back room while I 'm holding him and get the coagulant serum off the back shelf ! In the storage closet ? Yes , Jason ! I got it ! Hurry , Jason ! I got it ! We don 't have much time . Let 's move ! ( YELLS ) ( MANIACAL LAUGHING ) Professor ! Professor ! I have an appointment with love ! Good night , hamster boy ! ( POUNDING ON DOOR ) No , Professor ! ( SCREAMING ) " Sorry I haven 't phoned , but I haven 't been myself lately . " Join me for dinner . Buddy Love . " P.S. I 've enclosed a wallet-sized photo for your enjoyment . " ( CHUCKLING ) ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) Buddy , how can I stay mad at you ? This is gorgeous ! You 're gorgeous and I 'm gorgeous , so we should be in gorgeous surroundings . Let me get the room key . Wait . Hold it . I didn 't say anything about going to any room with you . You said you were taking me to dinner . What are you talking about ? Oh , you think that ... Oh ! Oh , my ... Hey , hey , hey . Slow down . I just want to spend some time with you , by ourselves . I don 't want to share you with these people . I want to eat , alone , quiet . I would never disrespect you . I 'm a puppy dog . Please , can I go get this room ? ( BARKS QUIETLY ) Yes ? Yes . I 'd throw him in the river with a Buick tied to his neck . He 'd probably drag the car down . Miss Purty . Purty ! Dean Richmond . Have you seen Professor Klump ? He 's 40 minutes late . If Harlan Hartley walks out that door , $ 10 million goes with him . Oh , Lord . I 'm gonna have to lay down in front of his car . Let 's go . Buddy , you know Sherman 's research . He 's late for a meeting . Fill in for him . No , it 's a nice thought , but he 'd have to know Sherman 's research . You know Sherman 's research ? Who are you ? You might say I 'm a visiting professor who might be staying for a while . I do know Sherman 's work . In fact , I am Sherman 's work . Buddy ! Do you think you can do Klump 's job and crowbar that dough out of Hartley ? There 's not a job on this planet I can 't do twice as good as Sherman . Good . Follow me . I 'll go do this just ' cause you asked me , not ' cause of him . You just stay put . I 've got to go be brilliant . Look at your fine self . I bet you have on a thong made of licorice , don 't you ? Excuse me . ( RICHMOND LAUGHING ) All righty ! Well , this had better be Professor Klump . Klump ? That fraud , that hack , that no-talent . No , sir , this is the man behind Klump 's work , the real genius . I give you Professor Buddy Love . All right , Professor Love . You have one minute to show me your research . Oh , no , you got it backwards , Rockefeller . You have one minute to listen . May I borrow this ? You haven 't used it , have you ? Don 't want to get your boogers on my fingers . Okay . Here we go . 25N times C. You have to excuse my handwriting . I 'm in a bit of a rush . You have a pleasant evening . Good night . Professor Love , don 't you think Mr. Hartley would like to know what that means in lay terms ? ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , you mean rich-dummy terms ? I 'll break it down for the rich dummies in the room . Listen up . If you eat nasty stuff like this ... I know it looks good , and some of y 'all like pork chops , but this greasy , nasty pork chop , do you realize there 's a gene in your DNA that routes this straight to your fat cells , and it causes unsightly conditions . Case in point , this woman is suffering from what I like to call " Jell-O arms . " The arm is taking on a gelatin sort of vibe . It 's quite nasty . To my left , this gentleman has turkey neck . To my immediate left , this woman is suffering from what we like to call , " Saddlebag syndrome . " To my extreme left , this young lady is suffering from what I like to call " Tank ass . " Please , sit down . Not tonight . I 'm your brother ! Like I was saying , everybody , where there 's a will , there 's a way . There is a way we can turn these genes off . I 'm not talking about using exercise or diet . I 'm talking about by taking a simple solution that helps reconstruct your metabolic cellular strands , thus giving you the appearance of , in medical terms , gluteus minimus . Or , in layman 's terms , an extremely tight , wonderful ass . Let 's give a big round of applause for the woman with the nice ass . Her ass is so nice , don 't you agree ? She 's worked so hard . Have a seat . Oh , are these girls with you ? Everyone has a nice ass at this table . is this the nice-ass section ? ( LAUGHTER ) Where 'd you find this man ? Harlan , it 's an outrage . I assure you he has no affiliation with this school . He 's brilliant . Exactly my point . It 's an outrage that his brilliance has no affiliation with this school . That 's why I found him and brought him to your money . Attention . Brought him to your attention . ( CLOCK BELL STRIKING ) My goodness , it is time to take my medication . Professor ! Hartley loved you . He 's going to be at the Alumni Ball tomorrow night . If you can prove the formula works , the ten million is ours ! What makes you so sure that the money is ours , instead of just being mine ? ( LAUGHS ) You 're good , Love . Very good . How 'd you like to fill in for Professor Klump on a more permanent basis ? That 's what I had in mind . He talked to me first . Hey , I 'm the one with the gluteus minimus . Will you guys just chill ? He said he could handle all three of us . With a name like Buddy Love , I bet he can . Carla , are you ready to go upstairs ? I guess not . Hey ... Where you going ? What 's your problem ? They 're my problem , and you can handle all three of them , huh ? Oh , well , I thought after dinner you might want to have a little group activity . After all , Buddy does have a lot of love to give . Oh , you are one sick , twisted freak ! Oh , come on , Carla . What 's the ... Hey ! Go on , leave ! There 's more titties over here anyway ! Think I want them two titties . I have six titties . I had two titties . Now I have six . That 's multiplication . ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( ON STEREO ) Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Boys will be boys ( BUDDY CHEERING ) Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Oh , yeah ! This is what I call burning calories ! Come on ! Help me burn this stuff up ! ( GUESTS WHOOPING ) Yeah ! Hey , this is going down to Mr. Wilson downstairs ! ( CHANTING ) The roof , the roof , the roof is on fire ( ALL CHANTING ) The roof , the roof , the roof is on fire ( WHOOPING ) ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Sherman ? ( CANS CRUNCHING ) Sherman ? ( CANS CLATTERING ) Sherman ? ( MOANING ) ( SNIFFING AND SMACKING LIPS ) CARLA : Sherman ? ( CHUCKLING ) Sherman ? ( GASPS ) ( LOUD THUD ) Sherman , is that you ? Are you all right ? Oh , hi , Carla . Hi . ( CHUCKLING ) Did you have a party last night ? Oh , no . My cleaning lady 's ... Cleaning lady 's sick , so I got to clean up myself . I see . You sure she didn 't die ? ( LAUGHING ) ( TOILET FLUSHING ) Oh . Look , I 'm a little embarrassed about the way how my place is looking . Why don 't I clean up and get back at you later ? No , no , no . Sherman , I need to talk to you now . It 's about Buddy . He hasn 't been misbehaving , has he ? He 's an egotistical pig , and I wish I never met him . But , Sherman , I owe you a very big apology . You owe me an apology ? Yes . Last night I was only trying to help , I insisted that Buddy Love speak to Harlan Hartley . He took all the credit for your research . Now Dean Richmond ... WOMAN : Where 's Buddy ? Oh ... Buddy came here ? ( CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY ) No ! So what 's this ? Are you guys ... You guys share girls ? Oh , no , no , no , no . I guess I was next on the list . No , you don 't understand . I cannot believe I came over here feeling sorry for you . Carla , will you please just listen to me ? I assure you it is not what it appears to be ! You 're no better than he is ! You are just as sick as Buddy , and I don 't wanna see you or him again ! Carla , please just listen . Carla ! " Eviction notice ? Violation of noise ordinance ? " ( CANS CLATTERING ) Professor , we have to get to the lab right away . Whatever it is , is gonna have to wait until later . No , that 's the thing . There isn 't gonna be a later . JASON : Professor , what did you do last night ? Jason , I have such a bad hangover , I honestly do not remember . Well , the good news is I 'm not going to kill you , not physically , anyway . I am , however , going to kill you professionally . You 're not only fired from this institution , but I 'm going to make sure you never get hired by any other college in the state , the country , the world , maybe even the universe . Unless , of course , they 're looking for teachers on Planet Fat . Oh , by the way , Buddy Love is going to be using your invitation to the alumni ball , so show a little school spirit and see that he gets it . ( SINGING ) We 're in the money Put that food down ! They ate yesterday ! ... really tight and say , " Yes , I can . " Say it again . LANCE AND AUDIENCE : Yes , I can ! Hey , chunky drawers ! Hey , tank ass ! What are you eating ? Mu · in ? Strudel ? Put it down . Let me talk to you . If you 're receiving this message , that means you went and plumped back up to your usual , fat , sorry , stuff-my-face-till - l 'm almost-dead self . is that what you did ? Shame on you , Sherman ! Do you know what you did last night ? You had the time of your life . Do you know you can get arrested in · · states for the shit you did just last night ? ( GIGGLING ) Oh , my goodness ! You know what you need to do ? You need to go down to the laboratory and mix up another batch of this blue stuff . Come on back to the party , Sherman , because Carla doesn 't want you . She wants me . Me , not you . So come join me because you can 't beat me . You can 't beat me . You can 't beat me ! Yes , I can ! ( BUDDY LAUGHS ) Yes , I can . Professor , I got your message . What 's up ? I 'm going to that alumni ball tonight , and I 'm gonna reclaim my life . Yes ! I 'm so glad to hear you say that . Get things straight with Miss Purty , and I 'm gonna get that grant from Harlan Hartley . Excellent . Jason , we have seen the last of Buddy Love . ( BIG BAND PLAYS in THE MOOD ) Horace , good to see you . The jitterbug contest just started . I 'm kidding , I 'm kidding . Your table 's upstairs . That 's anotherjoke . When did you marry Sharon Stone ? Keep those legs crossed . Hartley . Damn it . And where the hell is Buddy Love ? No sign of him yet , sir . Here 's an idea . Find him ! Yes , sir . Harlan . Well , Richmond . Where 's your Professor Buddy Love ? Oh , with you it 's always business . Let 's get to know each other man-to-man . Now , if our files are correct , you and your fabulous wife have a terrific daughter . I 'm divorced , and my daughter is in rehab . So you 're saying our files are not correct . Listen , you pompous butt-kisser . I have a check in my pocket for $ 10 million . Your Buddy Love has till midnight to prove that formula works . He 'll be here , the formula works , and you have the check . Really ? On you now ? Because on behalf of ... Which pocket ? No , don 't tell me . Let me smell it . Punch ? Oh , come on , now . Look at this . I can 't eat this . This stuff is too tiny . I can 't get full off this mess ! I think it 's wonderful , all the precious little finger foods . Finger food ? I got a finger for them . I ain 't paid no $ 100 ticket for no finger food . I could go down to Subway , get me a sandwich for $ 3 . I gotta pay a $ 100 ticket for finger food ? You must be crazy to think I 'm gonna eat this ... You 're getting on my damn nerves ! Shut up ! I 'm hungry ! There 's Carla. I wonder if she 's seen Sherman . Carla ! Carla . Oh . ( LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) Oh , you look fabulous . Thank you , Mrs. Klump . Have you seen Sherman ? Yeah , where 's Sherman at ? I ain 't come to pay no $ 100 ticket to suffer this alone . Cletus , shut up , please ! Hey ! That 's strike two . I don 't think Sherman will be coming tonight . Yes , he is . Sherman called me and told me make sure we was here . He got a big announcement to make . Something about getting it all off his chest . Have you noticed that Sherman 's been acting kind of strange lately ? Sherman has definitely been acting strange lately . I knew it ! See , Cletus ? I told you . You really think I be listening to you . I ain 't listening to you ! Well , Mrs. Klump , I hope you have a wonderful evening . Oh , you do the same . Thank you so much . So precious . Look at your little purple dress . They gonna think we twins . ( CHUCKLING ) Mr. Klump . Oh , yeah , yeah . Fabulous . You know , Cletus , I think something 's going on between her and Sherman . You don 't go get up in Sherman 's business . That 's Sherman 's business . Sherman 's business ? That 's my business . Sherman is my baby . Sherman 's 35 years old ! What you talking about he 's your baby ? I don 't wanna hear it . Shut up , please ! Carla ! That 's strike three , damn it ! Don 't you walk away from me , God damn it ! ( MUTTERING ) Hey , this is the last of it , Professor . I 'll tell you this , Jason . If I 'm gonna change my life , it 's not gonna come from some magic drink . Gotta come from a lot of hard work and exercise and plenty of these . Good bye , Buddy Love . Hello , Megashake . ( GULPING ) ( SCREAMING ) Professor ? Oh ! I lost 300 pounds in 30 seconds ! Thanks , Megashake ! You tricked him ! You damn right , hamster boy . I knew Sherman was gonna go soft on me . That can wreak havoc on a man 's sex life . ( LAUGHING ) See , I 've done some calculations of my own . If I drink 500 milliliters of formula , I 'll have enough cellular stability to be rid of Sherman 's ass forever ! You drink that much formula at one time and it will kill you ! If I drink it all at once , yes . If I drink half now and half later , that 's safe . At midnight , I don 't have to worry about turning into no Klumpkin . If you don 't mind , I have a date at the alumni ball , and you have a date with linoleum . Who ? ( MAMA KLUMP LAUGHS ) No , no , no , child . Not a wild party . Not Sherman . He 's too shy for something like that . He hates parties . In fact , we tried to have a party for Sherman when he was 1 · - years-old and he 's so shy , he didn 't even show up . Well , I must admit , it didn 't seem like the Sherman l knew . Oh , no , not my baby . Maybe he loaned his house out to somebody or one of his buddies was throwing a party . BUDDY : Yeah ! is that a test tube in my pocket ? Or am I just happy to see you ? Oh ! How dare you ? Oh , you know you loved it . I felt you percolating . ( GASPS ) Whoo ! Hey , thanks a lot , man . Thank you so much . Oh ! What you serving here ? This stuff is ... Y 'all got to get some collard greens and yams ! Some red beans and rice ! Some " Buddy " is right . This ain 't no party ! RICHMOND : Dr. Love ! This ain 't no ball ! Y 'all gotta get y 'all some peach cobbler up in here ! Professor Love ! Where the hell have you been ? I 've been nursemaiding Hartley for three hours , and if I didn 't need that money ... Shut up ! Who you think you 're talking to , Sherman Klump ? Man , if you ever talk to me like that again , I 'll kill you ! I don 't mean that as a euphemism. I mean , I 'm gonna literally kill you . I 'm gonna strangle you and cut off your air supply until you pass away ! BUDDY : Now find the rich dummy a seat. lt 's show time . It 's show time , everybody ! Show time ! ( BUDDY CACKLING ) ( JASON GROANING ) ( BEEPING ) Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! BUDDY : That 's enough out of you ! That 's it . You 're the reason everybody falling asleep . Take a break , Nigger-ace . Take the Everly Brothers with you . Get out of here ! Look at everybody sleeping because of y 'all ! It 's show time ! Now why are y 'all looking at me like y 'all don 't know me ? Y 'all know me ! I don 't know that fool . How about now ? You recognize me ? I don 't know that fool . Maybe it 's because this morning , I weighed 400 pounds ! You should 've seen me . Look at me now . You know how I did it ? One sip . I know why he like that , 'cause he drunk . Be quiet ! Don 't tell me to be quiet ! He drunk ! I like to call it " Buddy 's Wonder Tonic . " I know what wonder tonic you had . ( WATCH ALARM BEEPING ) Right on schedule . Cellular destabilization due to arrive in exactly three , ( BEEPING ) two , one ... ( SLOSHING ) Ain 't that a bitch ! What the hell ? My goodness ! Hey , moneybags , you want a demonstration ? Well , then feast your eyes on this . ( SLOSHING ) That 's a hell of a trick . ( BEEPING ) Ladies and gentlemen , for my final demonstration ... Look out , David Copperfield . I 'm about to make a 400-pound fat man disappear forever ! No ! Wait ! I cannot let you do this anymore ! This has got to stop ! This man is trying to kill Professor Sherman Klump ! That 's it . I 'm glad I brought my knife . Mmm-hmm . And I got my razor . Hand over the vial now ! Oh , sure thing , hamster boy . But first , a short musical interlude . ( GASPING ) Buddy ! What has gotten into you , and where is Sherman ? Sherman is gone ! Disappeared ! ( MUTTERING ) What the hell ... And that 's a pretty good trick for a man with an ass as big as his . ( BEEPING ) Oh ! I 'm late for an appointment . Ladies and gentlemen , say goodbye to Sherman Klump ! I hate being called hamster boy . ( GUESTS GASPING ) You just don 't know when to quit , do you ? ( GUESTS GASPING ) ( GRUNTING ) lt 's too late , fat boy . It 's over ! ( STRAINING ) Let go ! Let go ! My goodness ! Damn ! ( GRUNTING AND GAGGING ) Give it up , fat boy ! It 's over ! ( lN PROFESSOR 'S VOICE ) lt ain 't over till the fat professor sings ! ( SHRIEKING ) Let go of my hand , you fat mother ... Say one more word , Buddy , I 'll tear your arm off ! It 's time we take Nestea ... Plunge ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SOBBING ) Gonna get the hell out of here in a second. lt 's okay . ( GRUNTING ) Sweet Jesus ! Sherman ! Sherman , don 't do this ! You need me ! No , I don 't ! You fat ass ! Tinkerbell ! Blubber butt ! Featherweight ! Somebody better call an exorcist ! Sherman ! Sherman ! You can 't beat me ! This is some scary shit ! ( GRUNTING ) Yes , I can ! ( ALARM BEEPING ) Sherman , come back here ! Sherman ! What 's happening to me ? Everything 's getting real dark ! Oh ! I feel real jiggly ! ( PANTING ) I 'm blubbifying ! Sherman ! You need me ! I taught you to be confident ! You needed me , Sherman ! Sherman ! No matter what ! No matter what , you got to strut . ( CROWD GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) ( CROWD MOANING ) I ain 't gonna be picking up your big ass all night , Anna . Shit . ( GASPS ) Oh , my God . Well , I 'll be damned . ( EXHALES ) lf you give me a moment , I believe I can try to explain . My research is ... Well , when I started out I ... I wanted to help people . But I became desperate and selfish . What I did was wrong . Buddy 's who I thought the whole world wanted me to be . He 's who I thought I wanted to be . And sometimes when you want something so , so bad , you do just about anything to get it . But I learned one thing from Buddy . I learned that life is not about being happy about how much you weigh , but just being happy with yourself . I 'm terribly sorry about all this . I hope I haven 't ruined everybody 's evening . Please excuse me . ( WHISPERING ) I 'm sorry . Sherman ! Sherman ! Sherman , wait a minute . Sherman , why did you lie to me ? Why didn 't you say anything ? I didn 't think you 'd have me . I mean , the fact of the matter is I 'm a big man . Now , I will lose weight , but I 'm always gonna be big no matter what I do . So , anybody I wind up with is just going to have to accept me for who I am . And more important , I 'm just going to have to accept myself for who I am . Sherman , I don 't have a date tonight . Would you like to dance with me ? ( SOFT CHUCKLE ) JASON : Professor , I thought you might need this . ( CHUCKLES ) ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah , I guess I tore this one up , huh ? ( LAUGHING ) You know one thing I couldn 't stand about that Buddy ? What 's that ? He was too damn scrawny . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) Okay , Professor ! Looking good ! Have I mentioned we also have a terrific English Department ? I 'm giving him the grant . What ? I hate to admit it , but you 're absolutely right . He 's a brilliant scientist and a gentleman as well . Well , I told you ! HARTLEY : Will you shut up ! I 'm fine with that . Oh , Sherman , Sherman , Sherman , Sherman , Sherman , Sherman , Sherman ! ( LAUGHING ) Light as a feather tonight . Come on , bump me . Yeah ! ( GASPS ) Oh , oh , my goodness ! I 'm so sorry. I 'm sorry . You didn 't hurt yourself , did you ? ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm fine . ( BOTH LAUGHING ) Yeah ! Fabulous ! ( MACHO MAN PLAYING ) ( FARTING ) Oh , my Lord ! ( BOTH LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) Don 't start . Do it again . Go on , fart ! I hope your asshole fall out ... ( LAUGHING ) I thought it just was ... I thought a colonic was a massage . ( LAUGHING ) ( CREW LAUGHING ) For only research , and ... ( LAUGHING ) ( CREW LAUGHING ) What ? What film is this ? Your research . Get back in there ! ( LAUGHING ) We ain 't ready for you yet . Now what were you saying ? Hold on a minute . Let me go deal with my girl . What 's wrong with y 'all ? Professor Klump , the cages , what happened ? They can 't see me with your head there . ( CREW LAUGHING ) I made a fart last week . It smelled so bad it had a chain hanging from it . ( LAUGHING ) ( CREW LAUGHING ) ( MUFFLED ) I can 't talk . ( CREW LAUGHING ) ( CREW LAUGHING ) I seen Sherman get so hungry once when he was young , he beat up a grown man . ( CREW LAUGHING ) I 'm sorry . ( LAUGHING ) I 'm freaking out over here 'cause Eddie 's over here saying some wild crap . Do you ... ( LAUGHING ) ( FARTING ) ( LAUGHING ) Oh ! You 're supposed to say , " Excuse me . " ( FARTING ) Oh ! Oh , baby , you ... ( LAUGHING ) ( LAUGHING ) Hey , little Hercules , you want some more coleslaw ? ( CREW LAUGHING ) Come on , Cletus .

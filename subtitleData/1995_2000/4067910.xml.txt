 Oh , sir ... we , um ... we 're just ... Yes , I can see that . What was that all about ? I 'd call it an example of indiscreet shipboard fraternization . Really ? Sorry I missed it . Deck 6 . Thank you for your help , Tom . Yeah . See you later . Right . Here 's the cabbage you asked for . is something wrong ? What 's this ? A spawn beetle . Oh , they cross-pollinate the Oblissian cabbage . Have you ever seen such fascinating striations ? Oh , isn 't it beautiful ? I doubt the Captain would think so if she found it crawling around in her salad . There is something wrong . What is it ? No , nothing . I 'm just very busy . So , you 're seeing Tom Paris later . What ? No , not that I know of . He said , " See you later . " You said , " Right . " is he helping you in the airponics bay now ? He was just helping me carry these . How thoughtful . Neelix , this is getting ridiculous . You 're imagining things that aren 't there . You 're such an innocent ! I see the way he looks at you . I used to look at women that way . I know what it means . Janeway to the senior staff . Please report to the Bridge . Take care . Thank you for bringing the cabbage . I can handle this from here , thank you . We 've detected a strange energy configuration off the port bow . Any idea what it is ? It appears to be some sort of magnetic disturbance . We 're going to take a closer look . You seem a little preoccupied , Commander . This morning , I interrupted a couple who were kissing in the turbolift . And I 've been wondering if we should establish a policy regarding ... fraternization . Well ... the couple in question might be urged to show a bit more discretion , but Starfleet has always been reluctant to regulate people 's personal lives . Of course , but we 're in a unique situation here . The development of intimate relationships might cause us problems that wouldn 't arise in other ships . I understand what you 're saying , but ... we 're a long way from home . Everyone is lonely , and all we have is each other . I think , eventually , people will begin to pair off . including you ? As Captain , that 's a luxury I don 't have . Besides , I intend for us to be home before ... before Mark gives me up for dead . We 're in visual range , Captain . On screen . Looks like some type of energetic vapor . Magnify . Space-dwelling life-forms . Full sensor scan , Mr. Kim . Their internal energy patterns appear to be consistent with discrete organic processes . Captain , I 'd like the chance to study them at close range . So would I , Commander . But let 's not get too close . We wouldn 't want to disturb their natural behavior . Half impulse , Mr. Paris . Take us into bio-scanner range . Aye , Captain . The swarm is not particularly dense , Captain . I estimate their number at fewer than 2,000 . They 're really moving . He 's right . They 've accelerated to a velocity of approximately 1,000 kilometers per second . It 's possible we 're frightening them . Keep us within scanner range , Lieutenant , but try to avoid rapid acceleration . Aye , Captain . Take a look at this . See the way they propel themselves ? They seem to flagellate , almost like protozoa . Exactly , but they 're achieving incredible speeds- - over 3,000 kilometers per second . Ensign Wildman , scan the field for repeating patterns . Maybe they 're capable of some type of communication . Aye , Captain . Their internal anatomy 's also very unusual . They don 't appear to have a digestive system of any kind , but they have an extremely porous outer covering . My guess would be that they absorb nutrients directly from space . Incredible . A space-dwelling life-form capable of metabolizing inorganic matter . Particle density in this part of space isn 't very high . That might explain why they have to keep moving so fast . Feeding at 3,000 kilometers per second . Not exactly leisurely dining , is it ? Come in . For you , sweeting . Thank you . Hmm ... what 's the occasion ? Oh , no occasion . I ... I just wanted to apologize . Apologize ? For the way I acted in the Mess Hall . l-l was jealous . I know . I just wish you could trust me . It has nothing to do with trusting you . It 's him I don 't trust . I 've seen his kind before . They 're all over the Quadrant , as a matter of fact . They prey on naive , sheltered young women like you . What are you looking for ? A vase . Don 't ! What 's this ? Nothing . Just a snack . A Terran delicacy . Ensign Wildman told me about it . Mashed potatoes with butter . It 's delicious . Would you like to try it ? Ugh . Awful . How can you eat it ? I can 't stop eating it . I 've had six bowls . And the reason it tastes so strange- - l put a container of nitrogenated soil in it . Dirt ? You 're eating dirt ? Why ? I don 't know , but this morning ... What ? You remember the spawn beetles ? You ... you didn 't ... ? Neelix to Sick Bay . Prepare to receive an emergency patient . I 'm not sick . I feel fine . I just can 't ... stop eating . We are going to get to the bottom of this . Come on . No ! I 'm not going ! We are going to Sick Bay . No ! I 'll call Security unless you come with me . Holy ... Come on . Stop it ! Put me down ! They 're changing course again , Captain , and accelerating . Should I follow them ? I 'm concerned that we 're disturbing them . Let 's drop back a bit , give them a little more room . Yes , ma 'am . Captain , we 're accelerating . We 're getting closer to the swarm . Mr. Paris ? I 'm trying to slow down , Captain . Our velocity doesn 't correspond to impulse reactor output . We 're moving much faster than we ought to be . They seem to be ... pulling us toward them . Sensors indicate an EM resonance field . The creatures seem to be creating their own magnetic wake . That is what is pulling the ship . We 're getting closer . Mr. Paris , reverse thrusters . Helm controls aren 't responding , Captain . Mr. Tuvok , raise shields . Nonfunctional , Captain . They 're pulling us in . Damage report . Life support 's functioning normally , Captain , but there 's a huge fluctuation in the EPS grids . It 's wreaking havoc with the impulse engines . Warp drive 's still on line . One burst , and we 'd be out of here . But our exhaust could seriously harm the creatures . Janeway to Torres . Do you have any thoughts about how to get us out of this swarm without engaging warp engines ? We might try something like a targ scoop . Can you enlighten us , Lieutenant ? Klingons put them on the front of ground assault vehicles . They emit a high-frequency tone that disperses targ herds in their path . I can modify the main deflector to create an inverted magnetic pulse . Project it toward the swarm . It might be enough to ... nudge the creatures out of the way . Good idea , Lieutenant . Proceed . You 're sure the beetles weren 't poisonous ? Or the flowers ? There are no toxins present in her system . Doctor , why is she eating all these strange things ? What 's wrong with her ? I am conducting an examination in order to determine that . But don 't you have any ideas ? Her unusual appetite may merely indicate a nutrient deficiency . It is not unusual for humanoids to crave foods that are rich in the very vitamins and minerals that their bodies are lacking . You ... you can 't mean my body lacks dirt . Her body temperature is elevated 3.9 degrees . She 's burning up . And I 'm detecting elevated levels of electrophoretic activity in her nervous system . You have to bring them down . There is increased electrophoretic activity in the ship 's atmosphere , probably created by the creatures we 're studying . You mean , there 's a connection between what 's happening to Kes and those creatures ? You have to do something about it ! You are making it impossible for me to think , much less treat my patient . You must leave . I won 't . Kes needs me . Leave now or I will call Security . You can 't talk to me that way . This is my Sick Bay and I will decide what goes on here . - But ... - Get out ! I 'll be back . Don 't worry about a thing . Captain , may I speak with you ? It 's a matter of some urgency . What is it , Neelix ? I have been thrown out of Sick Bay . And I 'm just wondering if you feel it 's appropriate for a hologram to banish a flesh and blood person , who should have the right to be at the bedside of his loved one , who is extremely ill . Kes is extremely ill ? The hologram doesn 't have a clue as to what 's wrong with her . Though it may have something to do with these creatures . But he still won 't let me offer comfort to the woman I love at a time when my place is clearly by her side . Just how is Kes being affected by the swarm ? That 's what I wanted to know , but before I got any answers , I was summarily dismissed . Sick Bay to Bridge . Janeway here . Captain , I think you 'd better come down here . There 's a bit of a problem . I 'm on my way . Commander , you have the Bridge . Notify me immediately of any change in our status . Aye , Captain . I was conducting tests . She was none too cooperative , let me assure you . Then suddenly , she screeched and shoved me out of the way , went into my office and proceeded to erect a-a force field at the door . I can 't lower it . She 's keeping me out of my own office . Sweeting . What 's wrong ? Please come out . I was able to complete several tests before she became delirious . Her fever has increased and her pulse and blood pressure are dangerously high . Do you have any idea what 's causing these symptoms ? I suspect it 's the electrophoretic levels being created by the swarm . We should leave immediately . Unfortunately , that 's not an option at the moment , but we 're working on it . There 's one more thing . I discovered a strange growth on her back . It 's unlike any other tumorous substance I 've ever seen or studied before . And it was not there the last time I examined her . I 'll try to talk to her . Kes , please come out . You can eat anything you want . Captain . Why don 't you let me try ? Kes , please listen to me . We think you 're being affected by a swarm of space-dwelling life-forms . We 're doing everything we can to get away from them . And when we do , you 'll probably start feeling better . Are you ... saying that 's not what 's wrong with you ? Kes ... please , let me come in . Tell me what it is . Maybe I can help . Shh . Shh . It 's going to be all right . Now ... tell me what is happening to you . Di-did the Doctor tell you he found something growing on my back ? Yes , a growth of some kind . It 's the mitral sac . It 's where my child would grow . I 'm going through the elogium- - the time of change- - when my body prepares for fertilization . Humans go through the same kind of process . It 's called puberty . But I 'm too young . Much too young . It usually happens between the ages of four and five . I 'm-l 'm not even two yet . Listen to me . All your body 's metabolic activity has increased . It 's possible your reproductive processes are being accelerated as a result . I 'm not ready . We 're going to get you through this , Kes . The Doctor will monitor you constantly . You don 't understand . The elogium occurs only once . If I am ever going to have a child , it has to be now ! No change , Captain . We 're still being pulled along with the swarm . Heading 121 , mark 7 . Speed now 6,000 kilometers per second . All systems are functioning within normal parameters . How is Torres coming with the modifications to the main deflector ? Her last report estimated they 'd be finished in another half hour . Let me know as soon as she 's ready . Join me , Commander ? Kes is terribly frightened . She 's had no time to prepare for this , and the decision has to be made in the next 40 or 50 hours . She 's going to discuss it with Neelix , but ... there are so many unknowns . There might be risks in procreating this early . And of course there 's no guarantee they 're genetically compatible , or that Neelix has any interest in becoming a father . Seems your concerns about fraternization were ... prophetic . I wasn 't even thinking about procreation , but I suppose it 's ... the inevitable outcome . We should consider the fact that it might be necessary for the crew to start having children . It might take us a long time to get home . If it does take 7 5 years , we 're going to need a replacement crew in about half that time . Who 'd have thought we 'd be considering a generational ship when we were ordered on a three-week mission . I know , but it 's a problem we have to face now . What would that mean for the children ? What kind of life would we be giving them ? Aboard a starship , traveling through a potentially hostile part of space . And are we equipped to provide for their needs- - child-care , educational facilities . We 'd be building an entire community on board this ship . That 's a massive commitment . Are you prepared to tell them they can 't have children ? I can 't do that . And I 've made it clear to Kes that it 's her choice whether to have a child or not , but ... Mmm . There aren 't any easy answers here ... for any of us . Are you saying that , unless you conceive now , you 'll never be able to ? Yes , and I need you to help me decide , because I would want you to mate with me . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm ... honored . But are you entirely certain it would be safe ? Safe ? You 're so young . is it dangerous for you to conceive a child at your age ? I don 't know . I 've never known anyone as young as I am who had a baby . If you never had a child , would you ... be terribly unhappy ? Yes ! l-l mean ... I think so . I don 't know . I always assumed I 'd be a mother someday- - just not so soon . What about you ? Didn 't you think you 'd be a father someday ? Well , to be honest , uh ... I 've never given it much thought . Until now , my life has been so ... itinerant . There 's no way I could have provided the stability a child would need . But now it 's different , isn 't it ? Well ... yes . But ... raising a child on a starship- - that 's hardly what I would call the ideal environment . You don 't want a child , do you ? That 's not it at all . I 'm just trying to look at all sides of the issue . Bringing a child into the world ... it 's a huge responsibility . I know you 'd want to be sure we 're both up to the task . l-l mean , somebody would have to keep their eye on the little guy all the time , or he 'd be off sticking his finger into an EM conduit or playing with the plasma injectors . That 's right- - that 's called being a parent . What about your medical studies ? You wouldn 't be able to continue them if you had a child . Of course I would ! You 're just making excuses . All you 're thinking about is yourself- - how much trouble a child would be for you . Look ! What 's that ? The ipasaphor . It makes the mating bond possible . It does ? If we begin , we must stay bonded for six days . Six days ? In order to ensure conception . And after the ipasaphor appears , we only have 50 hours to begin the process . So I need to know your answer . Uh , well , uh ... 50 hours . That 's ... good . That 's good . We can sleep on it . I 'll get back to you . Sorry . I swear I heard you say lots of pepper sauce . What is the lunch special today ? Well , actually , I didn 't get around to making a lunch special . But we have some lovely gabosti stew left over from last night . Very well , it will do . I 've ... had quite a run on it as a matter of fact . It seems very popular . If it is all you are serving , that would stand to reason . You can have it with or without pepper sauce . Without . Oh ... Mr. Tuvok ... I was wondering . You have children , don 't you ? I have four . Four ! My ! That 's certainly quite a family . Tell me ... what 's it like being a father ? The question is so broad , it is difficult to respond . Well , I mean , it 's a lot of responsibility , isn 't it ? Watching them . Caring for them . Keeping them safe . Giving them an education . That is certainly true . Sounds like it 's a lot more trouble than it 's worth . Mr. Neelix , I am aware of your situation . It appears you are in some doubt as to the wisdom of becoming a parent . It 's just all happening so fast ! I don 't know what to think . I can only tell you that if you have considerable doubts about fatherhood , it would not be wise to enter into the process . It is so much more overwhelming than one expects that I believe only the most committed should become parents . Ah ... That 's what I thought . However , I must point out that , as illogical as it seems , being a father can have infinite rewards- - far more than would seem possible . My children occupy a significant portion of my thoughts , now more than ever . I have heard it said that children can bring a lot of joy into one 's life . I experience neither joy nor sorrow , but I do believe it is possible . Now that I think about it , it might be fun to have a little guy around . And we could do a lot together . I 've got quite a bit I could teach a boy , you know- - survival methods , piloting skills , romantic techniques . If you say so . But I must point out that there is an equal chance that you would have a daughter . A daughter ? I don 't have anything to teach a daughter . Why would it be any different from what you would teach a son ? It just would . She 'd learn more from her mother . I have three sons and one daughter . I can assure you , she benefits as much from my presence and guidance as my sons do . It is unfortunate that I must be so far removed from all of them now . I understand . We 'll get there , Mr. Vulcan . I 'm sure of it . Thank you . You 've given me a lot to think about . We 're ready to generate the inverted magnetic pulse , Captain . Proceed . lnitiating the field . It 's working . Are the creatures all right , Commander ? Yes , Captain , they seem to be fine . Let 's try to keep it that way . Thrusters at 200 kph , Mr. Paris . Ease us out of here . Aye , Captain . What are they doing ? Hard to know what 's prompting that behavior . Maybe they think we 're making a hostile move . Report . I 'm reading a massive energy drain in all ship systems . Impulse engines are losing power . Captain , some of the life-forms have attached themselves to the warp nacelles . Guidance , navigational and tactical systems are failing . How soon will we clear the swarm , Lieutenant ? In a few seconds . We 're almost out . Captain , I am detecting a substantial magnetic mass moving rapidly toward the port bow . It 's physiologically similar to the smaller creatures , just a lot bigger . Perhaps it is the parent . Or it could be a difference in gender . It 's hard to say without further observation . With all due respect , Captain , haven 't we done enough observing ? These creatures have attacked the ship 's key systems . For all we know , they were setting us up for an attack . It 's possible . Mr. Paris , let 's keep moving . If we can put some distance between us and the swarm , maybe the ones on our nacelles will drop off and rejoin their friends . Aye , Captain . 200 kph . The larger creature is moving with us . Now what ? The creature has emitted an electrically charged plasma stream . All stop . Damage report . No significant damage , Captain . Shields are holding . A plasma blast is a hostile move . Shouldn 't we be thinking about responding ? If the creature threatens serious damage to the ship , I 'll consider it an enemy . Until then , they 're all to be treated as indigenous life-forms behaving normally in their natural habitat . We 're the intruders here . Captain , look at this . They 're attaching themselves to the large creature the same way they did to us . And I think I know why . That plasma stream it ejected has almost the same subspace signature as our warp nacelles . Then the smaller creatures are attracted to our subspace emissions . Perhaps in the same way some species are attracted to pheromones . Pheromones ? You think it 's a sexual attraction ? Color change and provocative movement are frequently associated with mating rituals . Then ... these guys think we 're one of them ? Well , their behavior toward us and the large creature is similar . It 's possible they 've mistaken us for a potential mate . Yes ? Well , order the diapers . We 're about to become parents . You mean , you want to mate with me ? More than anything . But you were making excuses . I didn 't think you wanted to be a father . I just hadn 't thought it through . Now that I have , I swear to you I want to do this . And I 'll be the best possible father to our child . I know you will . So ... what comes next ? Before we begin the mating process , I have to go through a certain ritual called the rolisisin . What does that involve ? One of my parents has to massage my feet until my tongue begins to swell . Uh , where do you plan to find a parent ? If Captain Janeway weren 't so busy I 'd ask her , but I 'm sure the Doctor would do it . Will that work ? Since he 's not a real person ? The Doctor is very real to me . I don 't know how I feel about him massaging your feet . It 's a ritual . Someone has to do it . Okay . Okay , fine . How long will that take ? About an hour . Then I 'll be back . Fascinating . The stimulation to the sympathetic nerves must set off a hormonal reaction , which activates glandular activity in the tissues of the tongue . I 've never seen this response before . Although in a species known as the Gree , stimulating follicles on the proboscis results in a swelling of the auricular canal . Doctor ? Yes ? Am I doing the right thing ? You 'll have to tell me . I know nothing of this ritual . No , I mean , am I doing the right thing by conceiving a child ? If I were at home now , my father would be performing the rolisisin with me . It 's the time when parent and child move into a new kind of relationship . As the child has her own child , the parent must acknowledge her true adulthood . I see . My father and I were very close . He was such a wise man . I miss him . Sometimes , I think I hear his voice in my head . It 's almost as though he were here helping to guide me . I 'm sorry . I must be feeling lonely for home . It 's probably a result of the elogium ... but I really would appreciate your advice . Your help . I need someone 's guidance . I can discuss delivery methods ... or pediatric situations . I 'm afraid I don 't have much perspective to offer about becoming a parent . Neither do I . As long as Neelix was opposed to the idea , trying to get out of it , I was certain that I wanted to have a child , but when he said that he wanted one , too , suddenly , I was very frightened . Perhaps a statistical survey will offer a context . Among the Breen , pregnancy at a young age is a common event . The Breen , of course , is one of the most warlike of species . And then there are the Scathos . Any woman who conceives a child before her fourth decade is summarily executed . Maybe I just felt I should have a child because I could . There is a powerful biological drive , at times , almost impossible to resist . Species are driven by these urges in order to survive . But isn 't that why we have minds- - to look beyond biological urges , to consider their consequences ? If I 'm going to ask myself to look at those consequences , then I have to ask myself some questions . Am I really ready to have a child ? Am I prepared to give that child the attention and devotion it deserves ? Am I capable of taking on such a huge responsibility ? Oh , there 's so much I haven 't done . There 's so much I want to study and learn . I 'm not sure I 'm finished growing . How could I help a child grow ? If the smaller creatures are sexually attracted to our subspace emissions , then the large one may perceive us as a rival . That plasma burst it sent out might have been aggressive posturing . Then you 'd think it would be happy to see us leave . Lieutenant , is there any way we could generate a short burst of impulse ? Enough to get us away from this swarm ? I could try releasing power from the impulse capacitance cells straight into the driver coils . Do it . All right . I 've accessed the capacitance cells . I think I can give you enough for a short burst of impulse . We 've got one shot , Captain . You heard her , Mr. Paris . Make the best of it . Aye , Captain . lnitiating impulse burst ... now . Captain , the creature is reacting . It is approaching rapidly on a collision course . Evasive maneuvers , Lieutenant . We don 't have the power for that . The creature is accelerating . I 'm losing power . Can 't shake him . All hands brace for impact . Structural integrity down to 86 percent . I am beginning to share Lieutenant Torres ' views , Captain . Retaliation may become necessary . It 's not my intention to harm the creature . The feeling definitely isn 't mutual . Mr. Tuvok , launch a class - 4 probe . Maybe that will distract the creature long enough for us to get away . Aye , Captain . Probe launched . Another plasma burst . Shields are down to 64 percent . Looks like the probe just made him angry . This is an aggressive life-form , Captain . He 's only going to respond to an aggressive stance from us . Treating the creature as it is treating us might be an appropriate response . We ram him . Precisely . It 's probably the response he expects . Captain , shields are at 47 percent . Any more of this and the hull will start to buckle . Mr. Paris , use maneuvering thrusters . Set a course toward the creature . Give him a bump to get his attention . Aye , Captain . Engaging thrusters . The creature is not retreating , Captain . He 's just hitting us back harder . Let 's try this . Detonate a field of photon charges between Voyager and the creature . Maybe the shock wave will let him know we mean business . Captain , if I may . Maybe we 're going about this backwards . Yes , Commander ? Every aggressive move we make results in a more aggressive move by the creature . If we 're not prepared to use extreme force to destroy him , we need to rethink our actions . I 'm listening . If we 're right that the creature is responding to us as a sexual rival , we might try behaving in a submissive way . That may appease him . We 'd be acknowledging that he 's dominant and that we 're no match for him . How do we do that ? We tried to move away slowly . He wouldn 't let us leave . Maybe we need to mimic the behavior of the smaller creatures . We saw them rolling over and changing color . If we vent plasma residue , that might make us look blue . Mr. Paris , do we have enough power to take Voyager into a roll ? I think so . All right . Let 's give this a try . Mr. Kim , start venting plasma residue . Mr. Paris , roll the ship . Full power to inertial dampers . He 's not responding at all . It 's not working . Wait a minute , Captain . What is it ? One of the small creatures is detaching from the starboard nacelle . And another one . They 're all letting go . It appears we have lost our sex appeal , Captain . Good piloting , Lieutenant . Now , let 's see if we can move away without any interference . I can give you enough thruster power to sustain a speed of 100 kph . Acknowledged . Good work , Commander . In the future , if I have any questions about mating behavior , I 'll know where to go . Can I help ? No . Thanks . is something wrong ? No , no , nothing . You 've been very quiet ever since I decided not to conceive . It was your choice . I respect that . Neelix ... I think you 're disappointed . I think ... once I decided to become a father , I was looking forward to it . But I 'll get over it . Maybe you won 't have to get over it . Just wait a little longer . But I thought ... this was the only time . The Doctor believes the elogium was false , brought on by the electrophoretic field that those life-forms created . So there 's a possibility that I might be able to go through it again at the right age . You mean , we might still be able to have a daughter ? Or a son . No . I 've thought about it . A daughter , definitely- - one who looks just like you . Captain 's Log , Stardate 48921.3 . I continue to wonder about the issue of procreation aboard the ship . Certainly , it 's wrong to interfere with the private lives and decisions of the crew . Yet I remain concerned about the environment we could provide for any child born here . Come in . Yes , Ensign . What can I do for you ? I 'm sorry to disturb you , Captain , but I thought ... I thought I should inform you of my physical condition . Your physical condition ? Well , we 'd been trying for months . I wasn 't even sure until a few days ago . My husband is still at Deep Space 9 . He doesn 't even know . We were only supposed to be out two or three weeks . Wildman ... are you pregnant ? I know this isn 't the best place to have a baby , but ... it 's all I have left ... of my husband . Well ... congratulations , Ensign .

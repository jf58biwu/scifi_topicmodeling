 Professor : Watcl wlere you 're going . ! Flagstone . Do you realize we always seem to land on sometling lard ? Quinn : Don 't complain , Professor , next time it could be spikes . How long are we here for ? Three days , six hours . Professor : Mmmm . ! Just smell tlat fresl clean air . ! Quinn : Too bad Fislerman 's Wlarf never smelled this good on our world . Rembrandt : Yeah , well , wherever we are , they sure got a lot of fine-looking women . Must be a Saturday . Everybody 's out shopping . Well , things look kind of normal . Professor : Yes , it often looks normal , but it 's just madness underneath . Wade : Hey , guys , look at tlat . " Brooks Sisters . " Maybe on this world women have finally broken through the glass ceiling . I wouldn 't mind finding a men 's store . I 've had these duds on for the last three worlds . ( gasps ) Hi , sweetheart . Mommy ! Mommy ! I didn 't know you were into toys , Professor . You can learn a lot about a culture by looking at the way it entertains its children . No guns or war toys . Not one item is a weapon of any kind . Yeah , they got " Johnny Cage " from " Mortal Kombat , " but they have the boy sitting at a tea party . ( nervous giggling ) Uh , guys ? ( women gasping ) What the devil do these women want ? This must be another world where l 'm a superstar . - ( screaming ) - Let 's get out of here . Rembrandt : Ladies , give a guy a some room ! - Ladies , let me go ! - Woman : Unit 10 requesting back up . Meet back at the Dominion ! Unit 10 requesting backup ! Unit 10 requesting backup at the corner of Market and 1 4th . Repeat , escaped breeders ! Now ! Hey , I 'm going down ! I 'm going down ! I 'm going down ! Quinn : Wlat if you could travel to parallel worlds ? Tle same year , tie same Eartl , only different dimensions ? A world wlere tle Russians rule America ? Or wlere your dreams of being a superstar came true ? Or wlere San Francisco was a maximum security prison ? My friends and I found tie gateway . Now tle problem is finding a way back lome . ( tleme music plays ) ( plones ringing ) There is not a single man in this whole place . is it possible that we have landed on a world where there are no men ? Wouldn 't that be a kick ? The only guys on a world filled with love-starved women ? Gentleman , we made a slide to heaven . I don 't think so , guys . They arrested us , remember ? Maybe that was for our own protection . You saw how they were out there . Gentlemen , this way , please . All I 'm saying is , don 't say anything until we figure out what 's going on . ( women giggling ) Gentlemen , I could drive trucks through this story . Do you think perhaps you could cooperate ? We 're trying to be helpful . Madam , instead of worrying about where we came from and how we got here , just accept the fact that we 're here now . Ready . - Willing . - And able . - Detective ? - Yes ? We have a lead on the woman who was seen with them . - Miller 's already on it . - Good work . Detective Specateli , are we being charged with a crime ? Because if we are , maybe we should see a lawyer . Did I say you could talk ? Did the words , " Hey kid , want to say something ? " leave these lips ? I don 't think so ! Sit down ! How did you escape the virus ? Well , we- - - Took a lot of vitamins . - ( laughs ) This is not a game ! - You want to play games ? - That 's enough , Detective . Woman : You 're upsetting them . - Dr. Morris , let me do my job . - l said , enough . The Bureau has final jurisdiction here . Arrange for transportation to the center . Rembrandt : Just like being on tour . At any moment you could be overrun by groupies . Not a totally unpleasant prospect- - time permitting . Guys , eyes on the ball . Excuse me , you said you were from tie Bureau . Are you from tie fbi ? No , BRP . What 's that ? Bureau of Repopulation . Ah ! Damn reporters . Your information 's correct . They 've got three more . Woman : We 've traced tleir landier to tie Dominion Hotel . I 'll keep you posted . People , people- - ladies , just back right off . I 'll answer all your questions in a minute . Excuse me . What 's going on ? is there a convention or something ? They 're taking summer applications for our repopulation center . Every hotel in town is jammed . TV reporter : Unconfirmed reports suggest tlat tle patriots escaped from an enemy breeding camp in Canada . Here , in footage slot moments ago , tie men arrived at tle Oakland Breeding Facility , wlere it 's expected tley 'll be pressed into service as quickly as possible . Doctor Elaine Morris , director of tle Bay Area Breeding Center , refused any comment , but Clannel 8 News las been told tlat a full investigation is underway . - Doctor : Again . - ( coughs ) lt 's normal . EKG 's normal . Overall physical condition : prime . Grade " A " status . Immediate assignment . There , that wasn 't so bad now , was it ? Not if you don 't mind being graded like a piece of meat . Let 's give him the evening to get acclimated . I want to get off to a bright and early start in the morning . Five times a day for the first week and ... we 'll see how he does . You said something about a " first week " ? Yes , that 's right . You see , that 's going to be kind of a problem . We 're only in town until Wednesday . We 're really just sort of passing through . Well , I 'm afraid you 're going to have to change your plans . You saying we 're prisoners here ? No . No , not at all , Mr. Mallory . You 're a patriot . P.A. : Dr. Morris , please report to stimulation room 16 . An orderly is needed immediately in tle Compatibility Center . Man : Ol , but tlat 's so slow . I could make it real ligl . Knock it off , Trev . Knock it off yourself , you bloody wimp . Man : I gotta meet tlat Brad guy . " Cock-of-the-walk " Australians . Trevor Grant ? Tell me , what has Mr. Grant done to earn so many " Breeder of the Month " awards ? 215 confirmed pregnancies for the month of February alone . Incredible . Arrogant bastard . But the alpha males , they do the work of 10 . We 're just lucky he defected . Lucky ? ! Allowing that idiot to breed at that rate could set your civilization back by 10,000 years ! Quinn : Professor . ! Do you believe this place ? It 's like a buffet of love . You all right , Professor ? You look a little green . I have just had a disgusting protein drink thrust down my throat by a female amazon ! I tell you , any fantasies l may ever have ... about nurses has been dispelled forever . Quinn : Come on , let 's take a steam . Quinn : Apparently tiere was a conflict in the Middle East here years ago . The Iraqis released some kind of viral agent that attacked the Y-chromosome . Jeez , how is it any man survived at all ? Natural immunity , Mr. Brown . No matter how virulent the infection , statistically , a few will always survive . And now , the industrial nations are engaged in a race to repopulate . What ? These men are all captives here . They 're just cogs in some bizarre babymaking facility . The point is , we slide in 59 hours . We 've got to get a message to Wade . More important than that , we have to find a way out of here . Hey- - so you guys are the new guys , huh ? Yeah , we just ... got in today . You- - you really looking for a way over the wall ? As a matter of fact , we are . Just keep your backs to the camera . What 's with the security ? Are you kidding me ? You know how many countries would kill to get their hands on us ? Failing that , prevent us from breeding ? I heard some guy in the gym mention something about Iraq . Are we at war with them ? Iraq 's a wasteland . It 's nothing but ladies . It 's Australia , man . Australia a superpower ? That barren continent was barely suitable for an English prison . That " barren continent " was far enough away from the poison cloud to suffer the fewest casualties . They started this thing with over 1 1 , 000 men . Not to shirk our patriotic duty , but we 've got to get out of here . Well , my wife and sister are planning to bust me out . All they 're waiting for is a signal . I can 't guarantee you that we 're all going to make it , but I could sure use a little extra manpower . You in ? You can count on it . Man : Move it ! Move it ! The searchlight . Watch out . It 's slippery here . There 's a stream up ahead . Everybody in tle water . Quinn : What about the wall ? Man : Don 't worry . My wife and sister are supposed to take care of that . Rembrandt : " Supposed to " ? What do you mean , " supposed to " ? Man : Shh , the guard . ( police radio clatter ) Okay . Let 's go . ( police radio clatter ) ( wlistle blows ) ( alarm blaring ) Professor : Go ! ( groans ) You got it . Okay ? Okay . Code four ! We have a situation ! - Let me go ! - On the ground , now ! Come on , Professor ! - Come on , Professor . - Just lang on . - Let me go ! - On the ground , now ! You don 't understand , I have to get inside ! - You and 40 million others , lady . - Please , I want ... Hold your fire ! Quinn : All riglt , Rembrandt . Tlree up , one to go .. - Come on . ! - Ahh ! Professor : Come on , Mr. Brown . ! Come on ! Come on ! ( groaning ) - We have a situation ! On the ground , now ! - Please ! Get in , quick ! Hey , no time for that now , people ! Code four . We have a possible escape . My friends think it 's immoral to want a monogamous relationship . Yeah , " friends " - - that 's a joke . People are going to judge us , David . They can 't understand that the thought of you with thousands of beautiful young women is painful to me . The love that dare not speak its name . How long have you two been planning this escape ? Ever since Diana 's application was first rejected at the BRP . On what grounds were you rejected ? I 'm not pretty enough or young enough . They want " perfect " women to create the perfect species . They don 't need grounds , Professor . Offend the wrong petty bureaucrat , you 're history . So what do you do now ? Well , I think we 've got enough food and supplies for a couple of days . We 'll wait till things die down and then make a run for Mexico , where there 's no forced breeding . You 're welcome to take tie run witl us . Thanks , but I think our plans call for more drastic action . Diana , we need you to lelp locate a friend of ours . Clerk : Good morning , Dominion Hotel . Yes , I 'll cleck witl ler . It 's just awful , isn 't it ? The way this government overtaxes its breeders , I don 't blame them for escaping . Why ? What do they do to them ? Six , sometimes seven women a day and all those hormones they 're forced to take . Really ? It 's tragic . And there are so many good people who sympathize with them and want to help . If only we could get a message to them . Wade Wells ? Call for you . - You can take it on the house phone . - Excuse me . Hello ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's me . Wlere are you guys ? Woman : Dijon , tils is tie most amazing product I have ever seen in my life . All I do is spread the seeds , keep him watered and he 'll actually grow ? That 's right . And the beauty of the " Grow Your Own Chia Man , " is you control how fast or slow you want him to mature . That is so amazing . Okay . Now , Dijon , like many women out there , I am a little bit concerned about size . So how do I control that ? It 's simple . If you prefer tall men , water him regularly . For those gals who prefer their fellow a little more compact , once a week is all you need . Isn 't tlat fabulous ? ( applause ) Huh . And we thought TV was bad on our world . Listen to some of this- - " Sisters : the Outlaw Years . " " Hanging with Mrs. Cooper . " Tlis las got to be my favorite , " Tle Fresl Princess of Bel Air . " Where the devil is she ? Oh ! So exciting ! Find what you 're looking for ? Mmm , thanks . I didn 't exactly understand from David why you decided to escape . It 's kind of hard to explain . Your friend Wade , she must be an incredible woman for the three of you to take such a risk . If the BRP thinks you 're a defector , they 'll shoot to kill . Diana , I just got off the Internet with our friends from the south . There 's a way station in San Luis Obispo . They 'll be waiting for us at daybreak . Go tie rest of tle way by boat . You sure you won 't come with us ? Paradise found , paradise lost . It 's funny how reality has a way of screwing up fantasy . Not a thing about modern reproductive techniques . No in-vitro fertilization , no donor eggs , nothing . They 'd be more interested in my brain cell-count than my sperm count . I could have taught these people how to repopulate the Earth in a generation and a half . Well , it 's like they say , Professor , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country . " Well , this is certainly not our country . Where are you going ? To find Wade . She should have been here hours ago . Mr. Mallory , you can 't do that . You 'd last out there about as long as a pork chop in a pool of piranha . We can 't just sit here ! Mr. Mallory , that is exactly what we must do . He 's right . What if they 've got her ? If they have her , then they have the timer , and we could be stuck here for the rest of our lives . ( rapping code rhythm ) Where the devil have you been ? Nice to see you too , Professor . What took you so long ? Back streets . Maybe I 'm paranoid , but I think someone was following me . Where 's the timer ? What 're you talking about ? I thought you had it . No . You had it when we made the slide . You had it when we separated . Ta-da ! ( laughs ) David , Diane , Wade Wells , our tormentor . - Hi . - Nice to meet you . - ( tires screecl , siren wails ) - Oh , God . - Upstairs ! - Go . Please , hurry ! Go , go , go ! - ( screams ) - Police ! Hands above your head ! Let 's go- - quickly . Tear the place apart if you have to . You have no right to do this ! Search warrant . Read all about it . Quinn : Unbelievable . Quiet ! They 're coming up the stairs . Shh . - Where 's the handler ? - What handler ? The woman I followed here- - the woman who 's hooked up with the escaped breeders . Officer : I don 't see tiem in lere . We 're going to lave to put tie leat on tie wife . I got to get back to her . Listen , then you 'll both be in jail in separate cells . Did it ever occur to you before you trampled on my civil rights , that you might have the wrong house ? Well , it 's kind of a dark street . That 's it . I 'm calling my lawyers . I will sue the BRP , the SFPD . I 'll have both of your badges . Officer : Detective . ! You 're going to want to see this . ( detective laugls ) " Wrong house , " yeah . Detective : Tley 're lere somewlere . ! Look for a crawlspace , a trapdoor- - sometling . Guys ... Officer : Let 's do it again . the roof . ( siren , police radio clatter ) No longer lere . I 'm going back to tie station , all riglt ? See you tiere . ( lelicopter wlirrs ) Where are they ? They 've must 've gone through the attic . - We 're starting a house-to-house . - You let them get away ? No , Doctor , the BRP let them get away . I 'm trying to get them back . Okay , which way ? Less traffic this way . In case we get separated , meet me in the park behind the statue tomorrow at 3 : 00 . Come on , let 's go . ( tires screecl ) Q-Ball ! - ( gunslot ) - ( Quinn groans ) - Rembrandt : Quinn ! - Go , go , go on ! Quinn ! Run on ! - l 'm all right . - Go , go , go ! Come on ! Stand back , ladies . Ahrgh-hh ! ( gunshot ) Oh ... damn . All right , get him in the van . Get in ! Quick . ! Hurry up . ! ( groans ) Get in ! Go . Go . Morning . Where- - ? ( groans ) How long have I been out ? About 10 hours . Lie back . Whatever it is they shot you with is still in your system . You 're going to need some rest . Get your strength back . I brought you something to eat . Honey pecan crumble . You don 't recognize me , do you ? I 'm Jane Hills . I own " Mrs. Hills Bakery " ? Are you kidding ? My mom used to buy your coffeecake all the time . Really ? My husband and I started with one little store and now we have- - well , I have over 150 outlets . The virus ? Yeah . We hoped to build the business while we were still young and have a family later , but the virus had other plans . What 's wrong ? My friends are in trouble . I got to go . Listen , even if you were physically able , it 's not a good idea . It was posted in the lobby this morning . But the good news is , your friends haven 't been re-captured . Listen to me , I can help you . I can 't ask you to do that . I feel I 'd be taking advantage of you . I 'm a big girl . If I want to be taken advantage of , that 's my business . But , I can 't pay you back . Well , actually , you can . TV reporter : At tlis lour , police say tie four missing breeders and their female accomplice are still at large . The BRP and the SFPD ... You know , I don 't get it . I mean , if it wasn 't the cops who grabbed Quinn and Arturo last night , who were they ? My guess , Australian M-7 . Who ? Aussie operatives . They 're so bold , they broke into the repopulation center . They got caught with 250 pounds of saltpeter . David , if the Australians got the others , where would they take them ? Their consulate , I guess . What are you thinking , girl ? If we can get into the consulate , we can slide out of there . Yeah , that 's no problem . We 'll just walk up to the enemy and ask them for a guided tour . Not quite . We 're going to defect . Good morning , Mr. Arturo . Sleep well ? It 's Professor Arturo , and no , I did not sleep well . Do you imagine you can snatcl a man off tie streets witlout tiere being consequences ? Quit your bitching , mate , and save your strength . We got a lot of lassies waiting for you . I beg your pardon ? You 're no Trevor Grant , but you 'll do . The " baby gap , " you know ? And eat your Vegemite . You 'll need to maximize your sperm count where you 're going . And where would that be ? Canberra . We got a right nice breeding facility there . G 'day , Professor . ( sighs ) Good Lord . How ya doing ? ( lauglter ) This is the absolute rock bottom . You 'll be fine ... just as soon as you get rid of the mustache . You can forget that . I 've had the " stache " since high school , I 'm not shaving it for the world ! Are you crazy ? Rembrandt , you have to ! Huh-uh . The dress and the heels are enough of an indignity . All right . Wait a minute . Try this . Not bad , if you 're looking to rob a train . Let 's just hope there 's no moon . - Rembrandt . - What ? You 're walking like a guy . Try to take smaller steps , and don 't swing your arms so much . How 's that ? Well , don 't be surprised if no one asks you to the prom . Hey , how come I feel 10 pounds heavier ? There 's still time to reconsider . My lawyer ought to be calling back any minute . - l can 't leave without Diana . - You 're sure ? Okay . ( sighs ) Take care of yourself . All right . You , too . Let 's do it ! Rembrandt : Yeal , let 's do it . You better not ever tell anyone " The Crying Man " did this . Your secret 's safe . Unless of course , we get out of this mess . Jesus , my legs are freezing . I told you to wear the pantyhose . I can honestly say I never thought anyone would say those words to me . So what if they 're not there ? No time to be negative , Rembrandt . We can 't afford it . Wade : I need to speak with the Consul General . I have a defector from an American breeding center who 's seeking sanctuary in Australia . Open the gate . Professor : Good gracious me . Miss Wells ! Rembrandt , look . Up here , Miss Wells ! Let 's go ! Move it ! - Professor : Hurry . ! - That man is an American citizen ! He is being leld against lis will . ! What is going on out here ? - Professor : Quinn 's not lere . ! - You ? ! They say he wants to defect . I know we need men , but not the kind that dress like this . I demand to see Maximilian Arturo and Quinn Mallory , or there 's no deal . Who is Quinn Mallory ? Girl , we 've stepped in it now . Listen , you little twit , you are not going to ignite an international incident . Now do as you 're told ! This is bad . - We can 't slide without Q-Ball . - That 's if we slide at all . Where the hell are they taking us ? I heard something about a shipping container . Where are we going ? What do you think , we 're going to let you out so you can go screaming to the United Nations ? Our mates across the Pacific will figure out what to do with you . You 're making a mistake . - What if I can get you Trevor Grant ? - Get in the car . Listen to me . Who 's going to mean more to your handlers back in Canberra ? A national treasure , or an American transvestite and an overweight Englishman ? Oh , man , that 's cold . It 's a stall . It 's desperation talking . Wait . Start talking . What 's up ? I checked the Dominion Hotel , nobody at the BRP seems to know anything . I 'm sorry . We could stay here , you know , or we could get to Mexico . I don 't think so . You 're upset with me , aren 't you ? is what I 'm asking so outrageous ? If I say " no , " it sounds like I 'm rejecting you . If I say " yes " ... What would be so awful about fathering my child ? Or do you feel I 'm pressuring you into a greater commitment ? That 's not it . Even if it was something we both agreed on , I don 't want to have a kid ... I 'll never see . Quinn , I 'm not an approved recipient . I 've come to terms with not having another man in my life , but to face life without a child- - to have no one to love , or who loves me- - fathers are in short supply these days . And a child needs love , Quinn . A mother who 'll love him , who 'll sacrifice anything . What , are you- - are you crazy ? David , we can play both sides against the middle . If I can pull this off , we 'll all get what we want . Yeah , well , I want Diana and I want my freedom . - You going to be able to arrange that for me ? - l think so . How ? Okay , look- - this is going to require a leap of faith . Detective : You 've got 30 seconds . You want the patriots back ? Change the attitude . You said something on the phone about the Australians . The Australians are prepared to broker a deal . Three of the missing patriots for Trevor Grant- - in addition to tie release of Diane Isley . No , out of the question . What if I told you Trevor Grant was about to go on the disabled list ? What are you talking about ? The security of the BRP has been breached . An Australian double agent is on the list of approved recipients , and she 's going to inject your superman with a mumps virus . He 'll be sterile . Even if that were true , we 'll stop them . How ? The only sure way is to stop all women from seeing him , and that sort of defeats the purpose , doesn 't it ? Trevor Grant is worth 1 , 200 pregnancies , tops . The escapees are worth at least that , plus which , you 'll be varying your gene pool . Why are we doing this under a bridge ? Wells said the Americans insisted on it . Why is this exchange taking place under the bridge ? Wells said the Australians insisted on it . Where is Wade ? I don 't know . But we are supposed to slide in six minutes . Welcome lome , Trevor . Dr. Morris , Detective . - Detective : Bitch . - The deal was three breeders for Mr. Grant . Right here . Well , I hope you enjoyed your stay . Frankly , madam , I would sooner have had my liver eaten by a vulture . So what do we do now ? We can do nothing . Wade has the timer . Nice doing business with you , Yank . Watch out for the wallabies . Get in the van . You . Police radio : Unit five , unit five . On my signal . Unit five , your van will be late in arriving . - What ? - Someone ripped out tie distributor wire . - l can 't read you . - Now ! Hey ! Hey- - ! Detective : Tlis is unit five . I need a backup . ! - Where are we going ? - Just hang on . ( siren wailing ) What 's going on here ? What the devil ? Distributor wire . This baby 's a rental . ( laughs ) You are unbelievable , girl . Yeah ? Tell that to the rent-a-car place . They 're going to slam my credit when this thing doesn 't come back . - Well , what about Quinn ? - You believe in miracles , Rembrandt ? Start praying ! Rembrandt : All riglt . ! Wade : Hang on , guys . ! Yes ! Like I said , a leap of faith !

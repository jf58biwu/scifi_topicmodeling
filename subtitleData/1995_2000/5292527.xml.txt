 Previously on Earth 2 . Think I 'm , like , becoming part Terrian or something ? 'Cause they think I 'm probably their prince , and I couldjust command them . He 's the link to the Terrians . It 's in his blood . Security alert . - Savages . Think we weren 't expecting you ? Activate now . Security alert . Security alert . Damn it , activate . Security alert . Security alert . Wait till headquarters sees this . Open it . Looks like we moved for a rook and captured the king . Who is he ? Don 't you know him ? Fearless leader of the rebel Terrians . He 's Ulysses Adair . Today 's the 104th day we 've been on this planet . That 's according to space station calendars . Yale 's working on a new one , but I 'm glad we haven 't switched yet ... because on the old calendars , it 's exactly 364 days since I turned eight . That means tomorrow 's my birthday . There he is . What are you going to be , Uly ? Thirteen ? Fourteen ? No . Just nine . Nine ? That 's old enough to get down and finish your work . Morgan . Last year , we spent my birthday on a Syndrome ward ... with all the other sick kids . But my mom threw a party anyway . And Yale gave me a V.R. program called " All the Things I Can Be . " But I knew he was just trying to keep my spirits up . Kids with the Syndrome weren 't supposed to live past their eighth birthday . But here I am . I haven 't even sneezed in four months - thanks to the Terrians . I guess it 's really time for me to start thinking about what I 'll be when I grow up . Yale , we 're going for one more load before sunset . All right . Keep your eye on the time . Okay . Great ! A swing ! No , Uly . ! Come on , get off . Isn 't it for my birthday ? No . I 'm sorry . It 's for me , okay ? Get off ! . You 're selfish . No , I 'm not . Get off ! . Kids , that is enough . Please . Now , aren 't you supposed to be helping with the firewood , Uly ? Yes . And I think Yale could use an extra set of hands . Okay . Devon , it 's Alonzo . We 're scouting the high country . Ah . With good news , I hope . Sorry to disappoint you , Dev , but we 've descended another thousand feet . We still haven 't found a wide pass . Vehicles will never make it through . Damn . No sense in going any further . The temperature dropped anyway , so we 're gonna head back . Alonzo ! Alonzo , what 's happening ? Alonzo , what is it ? We 're not sure , Devon . Oh , my head ! My head ! They 're screaming at me ! Who 's screaming ? The Terrians ! Baines ! - I 'm okay ! - Magus , do you need a rescue ? Let 's go ! Come on , over here . The Terrians are firing . We 're making a run for it . They stopped . They stopped screaming too . Magus , do you need a rescue ? No . They stopped firing . I think we 're okay here . Why were they firing at us ? They said to stay off their territory . I guess they meant it . At least we know where not to go . Let 's go . Do you have any idea what kind of trouble you 're in ? I guess we 'll let the Justice Committee decide that . We 've recently approved new penal codes . When our security is at stake , the area marshal is allowed to act without review . Looks like it 's just the two of us , Uly . So - let 's look over your offenses . Trespassing , attempted sabotage of public works - What about your violation of the national lands treaty ? inciting the native population to violence - Illegal expansion ? The murder of 12 Terrians ? - That was unfortunate . - You knew your converters would leak on to their land . Just as the Terrians knew that the original treaty gave them control of our water supply . I 've recently drafted a new treaty , which entitles us to an additional 10,000 hectares ... and riparian rights to the Upper Morgan River . You sign this ... on behalf of the Terrians , and I 'll grant you a full pardon . I think you know what you can do with your treaty . I told her you 'd say that . Who ? She didn 't think that you 'd want her involved , but being the great mediator that she is , she couldn 't resist intervening . My mother has no influence over me . We don 't even speak . Nevertheless , when she knew what was at stake , she insisted on flying in . I 'll leave the two of you alone . You 've been all over the news chips lately . There 's a lot of work to be done . I know . Congratulations on your arbitration in the northern settlement . Must 've given you quite a laugh . Voting rights don 't mean much to Terrians . Yet for humans , who haven 't mastered telepathic consensus , it was a very big step . No , it wasn 't . It was another arrogant gesture on the part of people ... who want to civilize a species they should be learning from . Each species can learn from the other . Not if one is exterminated . Uly , that 's why we are fighting very hard to make crimes against Terrians a global offense . But in the meantime , Max hides behind territorial rights and ignores you . And he 's gonna keep on ignoring you until someone makes him stop . With what ? Violence ? You 're already losing support among some moderates who are starting to believe Max , that those who have been healed by the Terrians have lost all compassion for their fellow humans . Now , why can 't you see the bigger picture here ? I guess I don 't have your knack for diplomacy . I can 't smile and shake hands with scum like Max . Right now , you don 't have much of a choice . There is a surgeon out there , prepping to perform a chromo-alt on you - to erase your Terrian qualities forever . Not without my consent . Oh , yes , without your consent . As you said , this is Max 's territory . Give Max what he wants for now . Then you and I can walk out of here ... and fight this thing on neutral ground . No . If I compromise now , Max won 't stop . Maybe the chromo-alt 's a perfect idea . What ? Maybe a human martyr is what it 'll take ... to make people rise up against Max . Oh , my God , Uly . Do you know what you 're saying ? You would be sick again . It always comes back to me , doesn 't it ? Who can 't see the bigger picture here , Mom ? Alonzo said the Terrians fired without warning . Yeah . Yeah , but , Uly , there 's nothing to worry about , because we 're safe as long as we stay off their land . They made that very clear . Yeah . Tomorrow 's your birthday . Aren 't you excited ? Yeah . When was I born - exactly ? Exactly ? Exactly you were born at 6 : 37 in the morning . Were you happy to see me ? Happy ? God . I 'd never been happier . Even though I was sick ? Oh , Uly . You were so special . As soon as you were born , the doctors took you away ... and put you in an incubator . And when I finally got to see you , you turned and looked right at me . I 'll never forget that look . Not sick at all , but very , very strong , like you were challenging me to be your mother . Hmm . I don 't remember that . Hmm ? That 's okay . I do . Now ... why don 't you get some sleep . It 's a very big day tomorrow . Okay . Okay . Why am I here ? Who are you ? Mother ? I don 't blame you for not believing . I hardly believe it myself . Why is this happening ? The Terrians don 't dream to me . This is our first winter , isn 't it ? The Quonset hut . On our way to New Pacifica . There 's something - You do look like Uly , but what is this ? Can they read my hopes somehow and then project them ? Terrians did send me , but ... not the ones you think . My comrades must have found a way . We 've never dreamed into the past before . All I know is , we were attacked today , and whatever this is , I don 't trust it . Yeah . I could have warned the Terrians you 'd be this way . You 're not my son . My son is in there , asleep . He 's gonna be nine years old tomorrow . I remember that birthday . In the biodome , Yale gave me a sled that he made himself . Yale hasn 't made anything , and I don 't believe you . You stop . Just please stop . Mom , I was there . And I 'm near the same location now , 16 years in your future . Look . That 's why the Terrians dreamed me back here . You 're camped near this pass . You could go there . The same place where we were shot at today ? - You could save us all , Mom . - Stop calling me that . Mom . Mom ! Mom . ! Mom , wake up . ! Mom ! You were having a bad dream . I 'm sorry I - I 'm sorry I woke you , Uly . It 's okay . Do you know what today is ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's your birthday . Hey , Cameron ! Wait up ! What happened to you ? Are you sick or something ? I 've contacted the Land Appropriations Committee , and they have secured 10,000 hectares . He 's dreaming with his fellow creatures , eh ? Must make a mother very proud . Your schemes won 't work now . This entire structure is fortified with iron alloy . No dramatic subterranean escapes this time . Release my son , and the land is yours . Oh , this coming from the woman who promised all Syndrome children a healthy future . Oh , come on , Max . I pleaded with your father to let the Terrians heal you . He insisted on using synthetics . He was just scared . Scared ? Or shrewd enough to know that the Adairs would cut a deal with the Terrians , promising them that they could keep the best regions of the planet ? We never promised the Terrians land . The planet was already theirs . Which is why your committee 's offer is meaningless . I need your son 's signature to insure transfer without bloodshed . Tell the doctor to proceed as scheduled . Max , come on . You 're making a terrible mistake here . Our outpost may be young and disorganized , but that won 't last . Other territories are already talking of sanctions against you . You cannot do this , Max . They 're not so bad , the synthetic drugs . After his operation , Ulysses will get used to them . Unfortunately , the effects are short-lived . He 'll find he won 't be able to go more than a minute between doses . The pain , you know ? Happy birthday , Uly . Open another one . Uly , why don 't you find out who that 's from before you open it ? Oh . That 's from Morgan and me . Oh , it is ? You okay ? Yeah . Chocolate . Thanks . You 're welcome . Bess , are you nuts ? That 's from our private stash . We 've been saving it for a special occasion , Uly , so happy birthday . There you go . Come on , Bess . Can I talk to you for a second ? What a great gift , huh ? You 're gonna save that . This is a little something from me . Thanks , Yale . Ajump rope . No , no , no , no , no . It 's a rope for pulling ... this . Wow ! Thank you , Yale . I love it . What is it ? It 's a sled , Uly . It 's for playing in the snow . I made it for you myself . Wow . Neat ! I 'm gonna try it out . Um - Why didn 't you tell me you were planning this ? It was a surprise . That 's okay for Uly , but you really should have told me . I didn 't know you were going to react like this . I 'm sorry , but it was my surprise . Devon , even when I worked for you , there were some things I kept to myself . Of course . I 'm sorry . I just - It 's great . It 's great . I just , uh - You gave Uly a sled and , uh , you made it yourself . Yes . Yes , I did . My research is inconclusive so far , but I 'm hoping with further study and fresh samples I 'll be able to - Excuse me . Am I disturbing you ? No , not at all . What 's up ? Well , nothing , really . Just , uh - I 've been having trouble sleeping lately , and I thought I might need a mild sedative or a sleep aid . Okay . You-You mean you want it right now ? Yeah . I thought I 'd try and take a nap . I 've just been wound up , and I think that now is a good time to try and catch up . Okay . This should do the trick . But I wouldn 't suggest getting into the habit . Oh , no , of course not . This will be the only time , I 'm sure . Don 't take it until you 're lying down . It 's pretty powerful . All right . Thank you . Okay . Where is he ? I 'd like to see him . You came back . I had to . You said you needed my help . Where are we ? What is this place ? Uly . Is it really you ? Yes , Mom , it is . Oh , my God . It was too much to hope for , seeing you like this , just grown and ... strong . After everything we 've been through . But now your work is in danger again . Why ? What happened ? Didn 't we make it to New Pacifica ? Terrians don 't share our sense of past and future . They think that time is a delicate balance ... that shouldn 't be tampered with . Oh , but just seeing you , knowing you survived , tells me so much . Not necessarily . This may not be the only future . This may just be one of many possible futures . If I tell you too much , it could change everything . But didn 't the Terrians send you back to me ? As it turns out , I dreamed myself across time , fueled by my own will , something the Terrians don 't have . What 's he saying ? He thinks it was another human trait that pulled us together - something else he doesn 't have . Emotion . Love . I think he 's right . Uly , what happened with us ? Nothing . I need you to get my bio-I.D. from the medical tent - The tissue sample with D.N.A. extracted after the Terrians changed me , but when I was still a child . I can do that . At the mountain pass that I showed you , there 's an entrance to a cave . But the Terrians won 't let us on that land . That 's why you 'll send me down ... alone . Wait . You ? You mean Little Uly , you ? He 'll be okay . He 's the only one who can go . He 's part Terrian . They won 't harm him . - How do you know that for sure ? - Because I 'll be with him . I 'll travel beside him on the dreamscape . And my comrade here will tag along . He can 't dream back on his own , but where I dream , he can follow , and we 'll both be with Uly . But he 's just a little boy . He 'll get frightened . He 'll do anything , if you say he can . I always believed everything you told me . Okay . Now once he 's down in the cave , he must keep walking , take every fork to the right ... until he comes to a chamber . He 'll see a shadow , shaped like the tip of a Terrian spear , and below it , a triangular rock . He 's to put the D.N.A. sample in that rock , no matter what happens . Oh , my God ! What 's happening ? Tell me . ! What is it ? Uly ! Tell him I 'll get the sample . I will do it right away . Uly ! Uly ! No . Forget what I asked . Don 't send him in now . I can 't protect him . Mom . Mom ! If those chemo-lasers slip by a centimeter , it could be deadly . Why you - Uly ! Uly ! Julia ! Devon ? Did it work ? The sedaderm - did you sleep through the night ? Yes . Yeah , I slept great . Good . Thanks . Listen , Uly is very anxious to try out his new sled , so I promised to take him out . So can you tell the others that 's where we went ? Sure . Thanks . Do you think you should go alone ? The Terrians haven 't been very neighborly . We 'll stay close . We 'll be fine . All right . Thanks . Morning , True . You 're early for your shift this morning . Uh , yeah . I wanted to ask you something . Do you have any files about , you know , animals ? Like , animals from Earth , what they ate , what they liked - How they got sick . I think it could be interesting for new kinds of animals we might find here . Have you found a new kind of animal , True ? No ! Not a new kind . Same kind I found before - except this one 's not gonna hurt anyone . Where is it ? You 're sitting on it . God , child , will you never learn ? These creatures are dangerous . ! It doesn 't look dangerous . I 'll give you that . He 's in pretty bad shape . But still , you cannot keep something like this to yourself . I didn 't . I told you . Yes , but now you have to tell the others . Why ? You know more than anybody else does . Why can 't you and I just help him ? Because the safety of the group is important and - Well , we 'll keep him away from the group . Devon will want to be informed . I thought you didn 't work for Devon anymore . My dad says you aren 't just a cyborg tutor . You 're a free man now . My spirit has always been free . True , freedom doesn 't mean we have no responsibility to our community . We depend on each other . I hoped I could depend on you . I know I need an adult to help . You always think things out before you act , so I just thought maybe you 'd give him a chance . All right , True . We 'll do some research . See what we can find . Thank you . All right . We have to take this crate as far away from camp as possible . Careful . He 's heavy . Yeah . He 's coming out of it . May I see him ? Of course . Release her . But leave the hands . Hey . Mom . Hey . How you feeling ? Like a kid again . May I , please ? Thank you . Here , honey . Just like old times , huh , Mom ? Yeah . Drink this , okay ? Oh ! I 'm sorry . Could you please remove these ? I 'm not going anywhere . If you insist . Thank you . Leave it . She 'll take care of it . Right . Uly ? Everything 's going to be okay . No , it 's not , not if she sends him in alone . What ? I thought I 'd be able to tell , but I can 't dream anymore . I can 't help him . Help who ? Myself . Uly . It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . The day after my birthday , my mom took me sledding . At first , we were having a lot of fun . But then she got all serious . You know , there are times when you get the feeling that growing up isn 't such a good thing . I have a surprise for you , Uly . What is it ? We didn 't just come up here to go sledding today . See , the Terrians know that it was your birthday too . Do they have a present for me ? No . Remember how we talked about growing older meant having new responsibilities ? Well , today , the , uh , the Terrians are going to give you a test - see how grown up you are . What do I have to do ? You have to take this . Now , I want you to pay very close attention to what I 'm saying , okay ? You have to go down there ... into the cave , and you keep walking , taking every fork to the right . until you come to a chamber . And there you 're going to see - You know , it 's a funny thing about grown-ups . Sometimes you just can 't understand what 's going on inside their heads . I mean , the older I get , the more I think that maybe ... the Terrians did change me . Maybe I 'm not gonna grow up and be a person at all . The Terrians may try to scare you , but you 're nine years old now , and even if you do get frightened , they will not be able to stop you . You understand ? Maybe you should come with me . I can 't . But ... I will be with you on gear the whole time , okay ? Okay . Go on . You can do it . I know you can . Remember , every fork to the right . Okay . I could tell Mom was scared , even though she was trying not to act like it . But she always believed in me , no matter what , so I believed in me too . So talk to me , sweetheart . Tell me what you see . It 's cold down here . And it smells kind of funny too . I think I just saw a Terrian . Now remember , they cannot hurt you . I know . Okay , I 'm taking a fork to the right . Devon , it 's Alonzo . Do you read me ? Uh , Devon here . Devon , where are you ? Hi , Alonzo . We 're up above the camp , on the hill , sledding . Why ? The Terrians contacted me on the dream plain last night . It wasn 't a very friendly chat . They told me why they want us off their land . You 're not gonna like it . Well , what is it ? It 's Uly . The tribe knows that he 's a link between the Terrians and the humans , and they don 't want anything to do with it . This tribe ? Uly could be in danger . Uly ? Uly , come in , right now . Devon , are you there ? Uly ? Uly , can you read me ? I 'm here , Mom . It 's really dark down here . I 've come for my son . I 'm taking him back . Mom ? Mom , are you there ? I 'm gonna take another fork to the right , okay , Mom ? Mom ? Mom , the Terrians . What are you doing ? Mom ! Mom , they 're testing me . Hey , stop ! Let me through . I can do it . I can do it . Mom ! Mom ? Mom , I 'm lost . Why can 't you answer me ? You 're not gonna hurt me , are you ? Well , any luck ? No . I tried leaves , water , and spirulina . He just won 't eat . What about you ? I 've scanned everything about reptile , rodent , and mammalian life cycles , and I 'm tempted to believe the little fellow is trying to hibernate , just that he picked the wrong spot . I think he just seems sad . Or homesick . Yeah . What are you thinking , Yale ? Where did you first find him ? Over there , by the orange tent . Look at that . What is it ? It 's a nest . This must have been where he was living . Oh , neat . Uly - Uly , come in . Do you hear me ? Uly , are you okay ? Mom . ! Mom , I 'm over here . ! Mom ! Just - Just like you said . I passed the Terrians ' test . Mom . Thank God you 're okay . Sure , I 'm okay . The Terrians didn 't hurt me , just like you said . That 's right - just like I said . Sorry to interrupt . I 've dropped the assault charges against you , Devon . Your exit visas are at the front gate . You 're both free to leave - just as soon as we finish this final order of business . What is it ? A treaty - allotting 10,000 hectares to the Expansionist Party . You expect him to sign ? Why am I not surprised ? A thumbprint will do . My thumbprint means nothing . I 've lost dream contact with the Terrians . They know I no longer speak for them . Still , it does have symbolic importance - Ulysses Adair 's final message to the Terrians ... before he chose to return to a human state . That story will never hold , Max . You know why ? 'Cause we 'll be out there to tell the truth . You know why else ? Tell me . Don 't anybody move . Devon , relax . You don 't want to do this . - Oh , yes , I do . - Looking for this ? Please ! This is murder ! All right , then you tell your guards to open the front gate now . Can you walk , Son ? You bet . Good , ' cause this man 's gonna escort us ... right out to the helipad , aren 't you , Max ? I need a hit ! Then you keep moving . Get away from us ! I 'll kill him if I have to , and I mean it . Let us pass . Close . Close the door ! This is it . It 's 16 years old . I hope it still works . The operation won 't be easy - but getting to him is what I 'm really worried about . What do you think his chances are , True ? I 'm not sure . He seems to have accepted the D.N.A. , and it was from his own system . Where did this come from ? - What is he saying ? - They say he 's dreaming with them now . He 's coming around . Easy . Uly , easy . I 'm surrounded by beauty . He 's back . I think you were right , Mom . Two species can learn from each other . But how did you mange to hide that D.N.A. from your childhood ? How did you even save it for all of these years ? Can you tell her , Mom ? - Me ? I don 't have a clue . - I think that 's a good sign , right ? Did we leave this once ? I do remember sledding when you were - It 's okay , Mom . Yeah . I don 't know which I owe you most , thanks for saving me , or an apology for selling you short . Neither one . Yes , I do . Mm-mmm . I lost sight of how much you 've done here . Uly , no matter how much we 've disagreed , I am always so proud of the man you 've become . I 've missed you , Mom . Me too . Me too . Did we have to find a place so far away from camp , True ? Yeah , Yale . Don 't want anybody else to know . It 's a secret . You see , you can 't be too careful on this planet . What appears to be a dead tree to us , can be of use here . Hold still , now . You 're gonna like this . We 're gonna put you back where you belong . Get this in here . All right . We 're gonna put you back where you belong . There you go . Remember this place ? Go back to sleep now . I believe your friend looks very happy . Me too . - Thanks , Yale . I knew you could help . - It was my pleasure . Good night , little Koba . All right , let 's go . Let 's get back to camp before we freeze . Bye . ! Come on , True . You lied to me . You knew that tribe ofTerrians was dangerous . You weren 't about to send me into those caves . I had no choice . You could have trusted me . I never would have been able to convince you . Nothing can compete with that voice inside your heart that puts me first . It 's the only thing I knew I could trust - that , and ... knowing that you 'd never stay mad at me forever . Don 't be so sure . A mother never forgets , you know . You will , Mom . Stop . ! Stop it . ! You said I could try it today . Uly . You had a turn all day yesterday . Not today . Hands off ! . Stop it . ! You said I could use it today . Hey , hey , that 's enough . Hey ! Hey ! He wasn 't gonna use it till I wanted to . Was too . You were not . Come on , outside , both of you . I 'll teach you how to share . Those two really gotta learn how to get along . I wouldn 't worry too much about it . I think they 're going to grow up to be very good friends . What makes you so sure ? I don 't know . I just , uh - I just have this feeling . They 'll be fine . Whatever you say . Yeah . My birthday was so busy , I didn 't have time to figure out what I want to be when I grow up . Mom says I can be anything I want , so I guess I shouldn 't worry . And besides , right now I 've got more important things to do .

 Oh . Hmm . Oh . Oh . I`m up ! - Ah . - Phillip , it`s 7 : 00 . Are you awake ? Up and ready for a new day . - Oh ! - Oh what a beautiful morning Oh what a beautiful day - I can`t find my socks . - They`re in your shoes . - Where are my shoes ? - They`re on your feet . Thank you . Thank you , Weber . Hi . - Have you seen the paper this morning ? - Oh , yes , I did . You know , if I could solve this whole metastable compound business , I could save the college . A new energy source would be worth a fortune . You better hurry up . The loan`s due at the end of the school year . Not to worry , Weebo . I`m very close . May I see my schedule , please ? Ahhhh . After school there`s something . I know there is . What is it ? - This is your complete schedule . - Hmm . Let`s see . Unless you didn`t tell me something . What is it ? There`s something . There`s something there . What is it ? Oh . It`s something to do with white . Oh , what is it ? I know it`s something important . I know it ! Well , I don`t know . I`m sorry . I know it`s so frustrating , isn`t it ? I just hate that . I wish I could help you . - But I can`t . - Haircut ! Ha ! Hmm ! They can`t just close down the school . Outside of the lvy League , name me one private college ... or university that isn`t in financial trouble . Oh , all right . Name another . - You don`t think it`s too much ? - No . It`s elegant . And it`s a wonderful idea to go with the big wedding this time . It does put the pressure on the professor to show up . If he forgets this time , that`s it . Well , in his case , once is justifiable ... and twice is understandable , but three times- - Coming through ! Morning- - or afternoon , whatever the case may be . We have a lot to talk about today , so let`s get into it without delay . Oh ! Oh , uh , thank you , whoever gave me the plate of fruit ... and the dead pheasant , but it does not count as extra credit . Last time we were talking about Newton`s Law of Gravitation . To review : We see this " G " is like the " C " in E = MC squared . It`s a constant , constant universe , as much as anything is constant in the universe . It`s saying that the force of attraction between two bodies ... is in direct proportion to the product of their masses ... and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them . An example would be- - Let`s make , uh , naked man , " M-1 . " Naked lady , " M-2 . " Now , according to this formula , their attractive forces ... would want to close the distance to zero . Why don`t they ? Hmm ? The Earth ! Ah . So , in essence that is gravity and this ... is " Dr Richards Life Drawing . " It`s not my class , is it ? Phillip ! Over here ! Sara ! Ooh ! Very sorry . And so , momentum . May I sit here ? Thank you . Hello , Sara . What a pleasant surprise . - Hello , Ruthie . - Martha . - Martha what ? - Martha . Me Martha . You Martha . Me professor . - Yes , I know . - I was just gonna , you know , grade my lunch , eat a few tests and hope for the best . - How do you hold it in ? - Well , like everybody else , Ruthie . I just cross my legs real tight . No . I was talking about your excitement . - Excitement ? - The wedding . Congratulations ! The wedding ! Sara and I . Oh , the wedding . Oh , l`m looking forward to it . Aren`t you , honey ? - It`s today . - Are you sure ? - The wedding is today . Okay ? - I believe you . 6 : 30 at the Presbyterian Church on Beach Street . - I`ve been there . - We had our rehearsal there last night . That`s right , we did ! It went well ? - Yes , it did , but it doesn`t count . - Good . - No ? - The wedding counts , and I want you to promise me ... on everything between us that you`ll be there , okay ? I`d rather die than disappoint you . Well , this is going to be the very last time I try to marry you . I imagine so . I know that I love you , but l`m not sure that you can love me . That`s ridiculous . I love you with all my heart . With every cell , with every molecule , with every atom . I love you on a subatomic level . Hmm ! Prove it to me tonight at 6 : 30 . Prove what , honey ? - That you love me . - I love you . - 6 : 30 . - Good luck . Thank you , Betty . I knew I shouldn`t have come , but- - Oh , l`m very crazy about him , you see , Miss French . And this is the God`s truth : I want him to have what he wants , even if it means you instead of me . No , no ! You love him . Don`t give him up . Hey ! l`m watching something ! - Weber ! - Why don`t you be quiet ? I`m watching TV . Download some manners ! Ohh ! Oh , but he ain`t in love with me , Miss French . Mmm . Tell me about it . Hello , Phil . What are you working on ? Can`t remember ? I understand . It`s a damn shame they`re shutting your college down . I read about it in the paper . - It`s not over yet . - Oh , we`re doing fine at Rutland . No such financial problems . Hey ! Are you still working on that lighter-than-air compound ? It`s a , uh , propulsive polymer and- - I don`t mean to be rude , Wilson , but l- - I have to go . You don`t seem too happy to see me , Phil . - I`m not . - Well- - All the years we`ve known each other , studying , working together . - What happened between us , Phil ? - Well , I just got tired of you stealing my ideas , Wilson . And what would you have done with them ? You would have misplaced them , forgotten them , lost them . There`s no doubt you`re the brighter of the two of us . You have a genius for science . I grant you that . It`s just the science of daily life that eludes you . I`ve heard that copper psych before . Excuse me . That`s very volatile . I won`t deny that I hate you for your brilliance . I`m petty , corrupt . I probably would have gone mad trying to compete with you in pure thought . But , uh , l`m not an innovator like you , Phil . I`m an adapter , and to that end , I have profited from your ideas . - Why are you here ? - Well , to be honest , I`m here this weekend to steal your fiancee ... and make her my wife . Well , I think you`ll be sadly disappointed . I`ll see you at the wedding then . Eh , it`s a little crooked . - Yeah . There you go . - Weebo ? - Mm-hmm ? - The wedding was not on my schedule . - Mm , no ? - Why was that information deleted ? Hmm . I don`t really know . - Do you have another virus ? - You know , now that you mention it , - I am feeling a little feverish . - Really ? Mm-hmm . You are a little hot . Say " ah . " - Ah . - Ah . Ah ! Oh , yes ! Hot . Cold . Hot . That`s it . The hydrocarbons have been inhibiting the cooper pairs . But if you go from hot to cold very quickly , you get a conductive polymer and you complete the metastable sphere . Behold ! There it is . Now it`ll work . Yes ! But , uh , w-what about your wedding ? Sorry , Sara . Should I call the church and tell them you`ll be late ? Very good . Right . Very good . Ah . Flowing from the condenser to the pressure reactor . Yes . Yes ! Oh ! lt`s ready . Organic catalyst . The positive ... and the negative . Little touch of electricity . - Hmm . - Hmm . Oh ! Wow . What a bang . Yeah . Little touch of electricity . That`s not helpful . Oh . Mmm . Mmm . - Oh , boy . This is not good . - No , sir . - Weebo ? - What ? - Get a broom . - That`ll help . Two years . Wow . Oh . Oh , bless you . You have a cold . You should . It`s 77 degrees Kelvin . That`s very cold . Look . Come on . All right , uh , let`s try and describe you . Uh , you`re an elastomer . Yes , uh , um- - Ooh ! You`re highly viscous . But yet you can phase-shift . Hoo ! Well , uh , let`s see . You`re mouldable . Oh . It`s a little ticklish . Oh ! You`re foldable . You`re gullible . Oh . All right . Let`s see . Oh , wait a minute . Okay . And- - Ooh . You`re ductile . Oh ! Oh . You`re elastic . Let`s just see how elastic you are . Okay . I`m the hackeysack king . Hoo ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey , hey ! Oh , hey , hey , hey , hey ! Bravo ! Encore ! - Oh , boy . Uh , Weebo ? - Yes , sir ? - Take a picture . - Okay . Look this way . Smile ! Yeow ! Ow ! - Weebo ! lt`s amazing ! - Professor ? Excuse me . - It`s miraculous ! lt`s- - - Professor , it`s gone ! It is ! Oh ! Oh ! Professor , I think you gave it a little too much free will . Oh , no . There`s not a darn thing to be afraid of , pal . How can anything get in your window ? It`s closed , okay ? Whoa ! Hey ! Huh ? Oh ! Huh ! - Whoa-oh ! - Yeah ! Ha ! Mmm ! Whoa , Weebo ! I got it ! Great . Now what are you gonna do with it ? Oh ! It has incredible inertia . Mm , maybe it`s just glad to see you . - Weebo ? - Yes ? - Do you know what this is ? - Flying rubber ? Yes . That`s what it is . It`s flying rubber . It`s flubber ! Ouch . - Thank you for waiting so long . - Yes , ma`am . I`m sorry , Sara . Are you going to tell me , " l told you so " ? No , no . - I`m going to give you a ride home . - Thank you . There you are . Careful . Watch your gown . I`ve got it . Thank you . It`s perfectly safe , Weebo . It`s just an ordinary radioactive isotope ... that Weber is now removing from the lead containment unit . Very good , Weber . Then you place the radioactive isotope ... carefully behind the sliding shutter . You see , the sliding shutter works just like a camera . It regulates the flow of gamma radiation . Instead of billions of random particles , you have a precise stream of energy . Now we carefully place the sliding shutter mechanism ... underneath the flubber . And l`m burning up in here ! Weebo ! Over here . The gamma radiation triggers a metastable decay in the flubber itself . - Right . - Which releases enormous quantities of energy , - and that`s what propels the flubber . - Of course . Now doing it this way , I believe , is a lot more scientific ... than dropping it or kicking it ... or bombarding it with light bulb photon flashes . - Absolutely . - I believe ... by controlling the gamma radiation flux , we can control the movement of the flubber itself . - Cross your fingers , Weebo . - Here`s hoping ! - Good luck . Oh , yes ! It works ! Descent , gradually . Back up again . Yeah ! My wedding . Oh ! - I`ve gotta go , Weebo . - But you haven`t finished the experiment yet . You`re just getting started . You can`t just stop in the middle . The wedding . Oh , I can`t miss this one , Weebo . I`m aware of the time . Thank you . But your days are wrong . I`m getting married Friday , 6 : 30 p.m. - No . No , you`re not . - Why not ? Because you`re not getting married , Phillip . - Yes , I am . - You missed the wedding . It`s 6 : 30 in the morning . No . No . Yes . I`m sorry . - It is ? - Yeah . Sara . Sara ? You have a lot of nerve to show your face around here ... after what you did to me last night . Will you please let me explain ? No . There`s nothing to explain . You weren`t there . For the third time you left me standing at the altar . I`m sorry with all my heart . But please listen to me , Sara . Please . You know me . You know how sometimes I can get really fixated on an idea ? - I don`t want to hear it . - Sara , you`ve got to hear it . Sara , this is the reason I didn`t make it last night . It`s flubber . Flubber ! lt`s a metastable compound , Sara . In layman`s terms , if you apply a small amount of energy , it liberates an enormous quantity of energy . But the total effect is transient , Sara . The moment you stop applying energy , it returns to a quasi-plasmoid state . - Isn`t it remarkable , Sara ? - What`s remarkable , Phillip , is that I ever fell in love with you . You broke my heart ... so that you could stay home and make some green goo . Sara , it`s much more than that . Flubber could save this college . Let me demonstrate . - No , no , no . - Just give me one minute , okay ? The flubber is placed in my back pocket . When I exit this window , I will fall to the ground . When I hit the ground , the flubber will send me right back up unharmed . Watch . - Ta-ta , my love . - Are you nuts ? - I`ll be right back . - Phillip ! Ah ! - Ouch . - Phillip , are you hurt ? Just my pride . Well , if you think that you are going to get my sympathy , you are wasting your time . Ooh ! We are finished ! Sara . Oh ! Junior`s home . Dad ? Dad ! Dad ? Somebody in your organization screwed up big time . I got thrown off the basketball team . I flunked chemistry . I`m on , uh , academic probation . - How did this happen ? - I`m supposed to get A`s . - At least , that`s what I was told . - The only reason ... I loaned this " jerknut " college money ... was so he could get straight A`s and go to Harvard Business School . - This isn`t supposed to happen . - Yes , sir . We talked to the , uh , that Brainard guy , the chemistry professor . Now , either he did not understand us , or he forgot . The-The boy knew we were having persuasion problems , sir . I have a science requirement , you morons ! Quiet . We`ll have to get the " F " changed to an " A. " It won`t work . This guy ? He doesn`t live in the real world . - He has principles . - Get something on him ... that we can use to force him to change the kid`s grade . When a man says he has principles , what he means is ... he can`t be bought cheap . Hmm . Hmm . Adding 500 milligrams ... crystallized flubber to common hand cream . Stirring in solution . Hmm . Hmm . I just need one spherical test subject . Mm . Perfect . Yeah . Now , about two- - Applying flubber in a solution ... externally to golf ball . All right . Very good . Evenly over the entire surface . Kinetic test number one . Oh . Oh ! Oh ! Ooh ! Ah ! Are you all right ? All right . Applying light coating of flubber ... to surface of bowling ball . All right . Oh . Very good . - Right in the head . - That golf ball was really moving . - How`d he do that ? - I don`t know . Commencing kinetic energy test number two . Controlling horizontal momentum . Commencing now . Hit the deck ! This definitely has applications in the field of sports . Ho , ho , ho ! Yes ! Oh ! What ? Fluid flubber ... with a convenient spray applicator . It`s clogged . Hmm . - You seen enough ? - Plenty . All right , after the bowling ball hits , we break for the car . Oh , wait a minute . You can adjust it . Go ! Oh , damn ! Oh ! - Yes ! Weebo ? - Yes , sir ? - It`s gonna work . - I hope so . Now , let me show you how . I connected the accelerator to a sliding shutter . If I press down on the accelerator , it releases the gamma rays , and that increases the thrust . Ah . Listen to that baby chirp . Now , the steering wheel controls lateral motion . - Mm-hmm . - If you turn right , - Okay . - it`ll steer right . - Ah ! Turns right . - Turn the wheel left , it steers left . So , it functions a lot like a normal automatic shift ... - with drive , park , neutral , reverse . - Yes , yes , yes , yes . - It`s that easy . See , Weebo ? - Professor ! - Weebo ? - Help ! Let me out ! - Oh , Weebo ! - Professor ! - Oh ! - What were you doing in there ? - Flirting with the alternator . - Hope you didn`t touch anything . It`s not the time to play . We`re about to make a major breakthrough . Okay , here we go . Yeah . I think we`re ready . - Weebo ? - Yes ? What do you say we take her for a ride ? - Fly me to the moon ! - That`s it . That`s the spirit . We`ll fly over to Sara`s house , park this baby on the roof , and then maybe she`s gonna change her tune . You know , maybe you should just go without me . - Why ? - Because I get carsick . - Oh , come on . You`re not gonna blow chips . - No ? - You don`t have a stomach . - I have a queasy gyro . Now get over it . This is not about cars . This is about Sara . - Now get in here . - No ! - Now . - All right . Oh ! We`re fine now . - Ah ! Out into the world . - Okay , here we go . Look at this ! Let`s see what this baby will do ! Oh ! It works ! - Yes , it does . - I`m psyched ! Oh , boy . - You know what this means , Weebo ? - What ? I`ll never have to buy tyres again . Ah . Let`s see what`s on the radio , Weebo . Ho ! Latin ! Bam ba-bum , ba-bum , ba-bum Bum ba-bum ba-bum Hey ! Bum-bum be-bum bum Right turn . Whoa ! Yes ! Huh ? Huh ? Oh ! Ah ! We`re fine . Whoa ! Oh . - It`s all right . I saw it . - I don`t think so . Weebo , there is nothing to worry about . Oh- - Mayday ! Come on . Easy . Oh ! Sorry . First-time flyer . Shh ! I`m very sorry ! Hang on , Weebo ! Oh ! Ha , ha , ha ! Oh ! Whoa ! Oh ! Oh , Weebo ! Oh , now , we`re cookin` ! Whoa ! Oh ! Oh ! Yes ! Oh , Weebo . Come on up . Please . You`ve gotta see this . Wow ! ls this what you call heaven ? Almost . Look at it . The whole world below and beyond . - It`s beautiful . - The solitude up here . The stillness . - The silence . - Uh-oh . Silly me turned it off . Turns right back on . The shutter`s jammed probably , Weebo . We`re okay . Start right up . Oh , please turn over ! For the love of Newton , turn over ! Abandon ship ! Oh ! Yes ! It`s such a pleasure to spend time with you ... without having Brainard hovering above us . Mmm . - More wine ? - No . No , thank you . I have to say good night . I have a busy , busy day tomorrow . Mmm . Rutland would die to have you . We`d be together with nothing but time . Sara ? Mmm . I`m sorry , Wilson . Forget it . It`s okay . We have lots of time . Listen , l`m-l`m driving up on Thursday to Rutland for the game . - I`ll see you there . - Should I make dinner reservations ? Since Rutland is going to lose , l`ll pay . All right . If your team wins , you can buy me dinner . If your team loses , we go up to the mountains for the weekend . - Mmm- - - Cad ! - Do we have a bet ? - I`ll think about it . I can`t lose . She`s mine ! Sir Isaac . Out ! All right . One more time . What happened ? He took a golf ball , he rubbed this cream on it , and then the golf ball took off and ... popped Smith in the head . - Several times . - Mm-hmm . - I got hit with a bowling ball . - Repeatedly . - Were you drinking ? - No . Two beers at dinner . Wesson had a white wine . - With dinner . - Right . It`s this stuff he`s got , sir . It`s- - I don`t know what it is . I don`t know where it comes from , but ... it will give you one heck of a headache . Oh , goodness . I-l wish I could make you feel better . Hmm . So do I . Well , maybe l`m old-fashioned , but I believe ... a woman should love a man for what he is , and not for what she wants him to be . Thanks for the sentiment , Weebo , but ... this is really not an area you`re qualified to offer perspective on . Well , I don`t have much of a smile , but I do have a brain . I have to deal with this alone . It`s a human matter , not for computers . It`s for people . - Good night , Weebo . - Good night , Professor . Hmm . - I got it ! - Oh , no ! I gotta turn this thing off . This is so embarrassing . Weebo , I just had this amazing dream ! - Weebo ! - Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry ! Weebo ! Weebo ! - Weebo ! Wake up ! - Mmm . - I`ve solved all our problems . - I`m all ears . Flubber is going to the basketball game . - Basketball ? - Yes ! Testing , testing . Applying a thin layer of fluid flubber ... to synthetic leather surface of basketball . Application complete . Wow ! Oops . Two points . Implementing plan " B. " Very tight . Tight . And careful , careful , careful , careful . Secondary flubber experiment . Control elements : bungee cord , three-to-one elasticity ratio , fifty-pound ballast . Commencing now . Wish me luck . Oh ! Whoa ! Yes ! Ha , ha ! Whoa ! I got it ! Oh ! Bungee ! Bungee ! Oh ! Oh ! Uh , help . Uh , yeow ! It worked ! Yes ! End test . Did you fully fix the flubber on each tack before we painted ? Excuse me , Darth Vader , but what did you say ? Did you fully fix a 15 % flubber solution to each tack before Weber started painting ? - Yes , l`m positive . - Excellent . And how long does it take the paint to wear off ? - Uh , 30 minutes . - Be a little suspicious ... if the flubber started working immediately . - Uh , isn`t this cheating ? - No , it`s not cheating . It`s equalizing . You`ve seen the team . They should have their own telethon . Come on ! We`ve got to win this game . I`ve gotta do it to prove to Sara that flubber really works . I`m gonna do it right under Wilson Croft`s nose . Don`t fail me . - Weebo . - Yes ? - While l`m out , you`re in charge , okay ? - Okay . - No phone calls to Russia again . - I think that was Weber . Oh ! Make sure the flubber stays in the tank . - Got it . - Under no circumstances are you to release it . - Of course . - Because you know what would happen . - Ho , ho , ho . - Do you understand ? - Yes , sir , I understand . - Promise ? - Have no fear . That`s my girl . Go Medfield ! Okay . Good evening , everybody , and welcome to Rutland Arena ... for the 86th meeting of the Rutland Rangers and the Medfield Squirrels . Rutland , if they can just stay awake , should be able ... to steamroll the Squirrels here tonight at the- - All right , Squirrels , listen up here now . Okay , Rutland may have us in height and reach , weight and power , agility , speed and talent . They have the advantage on offence ... and defence . Sure , they`re-they`re better coached , better trained , and their will to win is unmatched in the conference . They`re undefeated in their last ... one hundred and eight games . But that doesn`t mean we can`t whip these guys . Right ? - Yeah ! - Ohh ! Rutland ! Rangers !

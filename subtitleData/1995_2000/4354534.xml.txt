 - [ Chattering , Laughter ] - [ Hammering ] [ Sydney ] It was your grandfather 's when he was in the ranks of the Belgian Infantry . - It 's beautiful , Sydney . - It said it kept him from losing his way . - I 'm glad to know you have it now . - [ Boy ] Nicholas ! Come on ! You promised you 'd read to me ! - I have to go . Thanks for the gift , Sydney . - Oh , Nicholas ? - [ Boy ] Nicholas ! This way ! - Don 't call me Sydney . Call me [ Line Clicks , Beeps Off ] - Dad . [ Engine Cranking ] Come on . Read to me ! Green Eggs and Ham , Sam-l-Am . - What is that ? - It 's a compass . It helps you find your way when you 're lost . Now , where were we ? Is that your mama ? - Yes . - Where 's your daddy ? [ Indistinct Shouts ] [ Gunshots ] - All right , back inside ! - [ Scattered Shouts ] Stay with your mother . Leave ' em alone . They 're teachers . - [ Groans ] - Rupert , get this one in the truck ! - Come on , boy ! - Get over there ! Get on in there ! Let 's go ! Come on ! [ Thunder Rumbling ] - [ Clicks On ] - [ Male Newscaster , Indistinct ] She was known for her successful film career during the ' 30s and ' 40s . Services will be held tomorrow at 4.00 . The family has requested that all donations be made to the Cancer Society ... in the Galveston area in lieu offlowers . - Bill ? - In other breaking news , four volunteer teachers ... were kidnapped in the hills of Appalachia . The educators were abducted by a group believed to be members ... - of a violent local militia . - [ Jarod ] Nicholas . The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms are following all the leads they can . At this point , they 're gravely concerned for the safety of these hostages . A bird saturated in crude oil . I guess afterJarod killed and basted it , he forgot to put it on the grill . - Jarod doesn 't take life . He 's making a statement . - Save the swallow ? - Somebody call me when you figure out what it means . - [ Phone Ringing ] - I think it 's sad . - Devastating . Flush it . - This is Sydney . - [ Woman ] Sydney . Michelle . Michelle ? - What 's wrong ? - Oh , Sydney . They took Nicholas . - They took him away . - Who ? - Who took our son ? - They don 't know for sure . They don 't-They don 't even know if he 's alive , Sydney . - What are we gonna do , Sydney ? - Michelle . - We 'll get him back . - Yes . [ Man ] Put her down in the next clearing , Captain . [ Man # 2 ] Roger that . [ Faint Radio Chatter ] All right , gentlemen . Listen up . We 're gonna pick up the trail right here where they were abducted ... and hope we all get lucky . Now this country is a real throwback in time . We really don 't know what to expect from the locals , but I do not want another Ruby Ridge - which is why we brought in Special AgentJarod Miner . Miner 's a tracking expert in this region and well-versed in the people . - He 's gonna help us find the teachers . - And bring them back ... alive . All right , gentlemen . Pick up your equipment , and let 's move out . [ Agents Chattering ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Miss Parker ] What was Nicholas doing there ? He 's a volunteer fighting illiteracy . - Broots , will you cover for me while I 'm gone ? - I 'll do anything I can , Syd . - Lyle . What about Lyle ? - Let me worry about Eddie Haskell . Sydney , don 't do anything crazy . Parker , they took my son ! Hi , I 'm Agent Cory with the A.T.F. - Have you ladies seen anything ? - Mm-mmm . - No . - Just tell me what you saw . - I didn 't see nothin ' . Did you see anything ? [ Sniffles ] I mean , you must have seen something , right ? Can you tell me anything ? Could - Was it something we said ? They 're afraid to talk to us . - Something has them spooked . - So " unspook " them . What the hell is this ? It 's the trademark ... of the Appalachian Freedom Militia . We raided their compound two months ago , confiscated a stockpile of weapons . The A.F.M. ' s leader is a man named Eldridge Hailey . This abduction - - It was a retaliatory gesture . - Hailey 's even more unstable than his followers . We 're talking about bombings , church arson , attacking federal officers . You 'd think these locals would bend over backwards to help us stop these guys . A rattlesnake - It uses its rattle to warn its victims when it 's going to attack . What , this is Hailey 's threat if they talk ? They won 't put their families in danger - not for us . [ Snake Rattles ] Green Eggs and Ham , Sam-l-Am . Hi . You don 't have to be afraid . My name is Jarod . Nicholas gave it to me . - Do you know who this is ? - Nicholas 's mama . Do you know where Nicholas is ? A man took him - took ' em all - up in the hills . It helps you find your way when you get lost . [ Sydney ] There must be something we can do , Agent Swik . The search party is already in the field . But there are hundreds of square miles of mountainous terrain ... where the A.F.M. Could be holding your son . I want to help with the search , please . I understand your concern . But until we can pinpoint the hostages ' exact location ... we have to be patient . I 'm sorry . I wish I could do more for you . Sydney . Don 't worry , Michelle . We will find our son . [ Sobs ] - Do you think they 'll-you know . - Don 't even think that . Hey , have you ever been to Flannery 's ? The coffee shop near campus ? Hey , get back over there . When we get back on campus , I 'll take you there , I promise . - [ Gun Cocks ] - Now everybody ain 't gonna make it , son . And the ones that don 't listen go first . So you get over there , you sit down , and you shut up . Even though sometimes it feels like my thumb is still attached ... there is something very streamlined about a four-fingered hand - the way the palm flows seamlessly into the wrist . It 's sleek . Of course , if you 're not thinking , holding a cup of coffee can be hell . [ Wheezing Chuckle ] Oh . I found Jarod . He 's working at a - [ Clearing Throat ] An oil refinery near San Juan Capistrano . That 's where the swallows migrate . Yeah , there was a foreman who I.D. ' d his photo . And Miss Parker ? - Uh , she 's out of the off - - [ Knocking ] Yes ? Excuse me , Mr. Lyle , but it 's urgent . She 's out of the office . - [ Paper Rustling ] - Well ... I 'm going to Capistrano . And I want you near your phone in case I need assistance . Clear ? Oh , yes , sir . Talk to you soon . What about Lyle ? He 's , um , gone to California . Dance , puppet , dance . Please , Miss Parker , don 't make me lie like that again . I think I 'm getting an ulcer . - Try warm milk , shot of bourbon . - Okay . Right . What happens when Lyle realizes that we sent him on a boondoggle ? It doesn 't matter as long as Sydney brings his son home alive . [ Phone Rings ] - Beth Swik . - [ Thunder Rumbling ] - I should be out there looking for him myself . - Where would you start ? - I have his picture . Someone might have seen him . - [ Phone Rings ] Yeah ? Sydney , we have to be patient . I have never been able to help in his life , Michelle . Now when he needs me , I 'm just sitting here - patiently ! Come on . Take a walk with me . Come on . I 'm sorry , Michelle . It 's just this helplessness - I know the feeling ... all too well . When Nicholas was born , the doctors discovered a ventricular disorder . They said that if it wasn 't repaired immediately that he was going to die . He was only a few days old when he had the operation . It was a ... five and a half-hour open-heart surgery . I sat in the waiting room , all alone ... trying to prepare myself for the possibility ... that my baby - of my baby - [ Sighs ] Leaving me . And now it 's all coming back , that feeling of having to prepare myself all over again . You shouldn 't have gone through it alone . You should have called me . Oh , Sydney . I disappeared from your life because the Centre threatened to kill you if I didn 't . It was hard enough thinking of burying my child ... let alone the love of my life . - I 'm glad you called this time . - So am I. [ Man ] Sir , pull over . We 're getting a satellite feed on the remote from Eldridge Hailey . Patch this through to A.T.F. Headquarters immediately . The feed is going through to headquarters , sir . There 's a satellite feed coming in from the kidnappers . [ Sydney ] Nicholas is alive , Michelle . - He 's alive . - Yeah . To whom it may concern : If you want to see these so-called educators again ... you will wire one million dollars into an offshore bank account . Hold up the access number . Now these funds will be considered as reparations ... for your violation of our God-given rights ... under the Second , the First and the Fourth Amendments . And if I do not receive word of this transaction by dawn ... further actions will be taken ... as demonstrated . No . - Oh , Sydney ! - [ Gunshot ] - God Bless America . - [ Static ] [ Whimpering ] I 'm afraid it 's not good , Sydney . Uh , Eldridge Hailey started the Appalachian Freedom Militia ... while serving 10 years for voluntary manslaughter . His first act after his release was a bombing that killed 12 people . He got off on a technicality . Ever since , it 's been extortion , murder , kidnapping - - Sydney , what 's going on down there ? - We 're not even sure if he 's - Listen to me , Sydney . You have to believe he 's alive . You do whatever it takes to bring your son home . - Why are you doing this for me ? - Because you 'd do the same . [ Receiver Clatters ] - [ Beeping ] - We 've got a partial triangulation ... on A.F.M. ' s satellite signal . It 's about 12 miles southwest of here , right in the heart of the national forest . I suggest that we get within a few miles on this fire road here ... and then we proceed on foot to avoid being detected . Well , we 've got three hours until dawn . - Let 's get it done . - [ Agent ] All right . [ Man ] Yes , sir . - [ Thunder Rumbling ] - Okay , we 're right on it . Is that where they are ? Is that where they 're holding my son ? I 'm not at liberty to discuss those types of specifics . There are contingency plans - My son may have been shot , and you 're talking about contingency plans ? - Why don 't you tell us where he is ? - I 'm doing everything I - - I got the governor 's publicity aide on line two . - Not now . - Ma 'am , the governor wants to make a statement - - Not now ! - [ Ringing ] - Get the message ? No more games . No more . - Come , Michelle . - Doctor ? Doctor , where are you going ? [ Miss Parker ] How will you know where the kidnappers are , Sydney ? [ Sydney ] I took the coordinates from the A. T.F. Office . It 's a start . Parker , I need you to do something for me . - What ? - Hailey is demanding a million-dollars ' ransom . Liquidate my assets and wire it into a designated bank account . It probably won 't be enough , but maybe he 'll take it . No . Syd , I got a better idea . - Let the Centre pick up the tab on this one . - The Centre ? Well , they 're responsible for you not knowing Nicholas . The least they can do is pay to get him back . You think Hailey will keep up his end of the deal ? I 'm going to find him and make sure he does . Sydney , you don 't want to take this man on by yourself . I have spent my whole life standing by while other people did their jobs - no matter who it hurt - without protecting those who needed my help . Not this time , Parker . We need to go there . Miss Parker , Sydney asked us to stay out of it . I understand a parent 's need to do whatever it takes to ensure their child 's safety . - But how does Sydney getting himself killed accomplish that ? - Well , maybe he 's not alone . - Maybe Sydney has help . - Jarod . Why do you say that ? Well , before Sydney left , he-he was at his keyboard . E-mail toJarod ? Find out . Kerosene lamps burning in that mine . They could be anywhere around here . Recon the area and surround the mine head . If you see any militia , hold your fire . We can 't risk getting the hostages killed . - [ Van Door Opens ] - What the hell is this ? Hailey ! Hailey , the money 's being wired into your account ! - I 've got a shooter by the mine . - Hailey ! - I just want the hostages ! - Get down ! Hold your fire ! The hostages could be behind him ! All right , cease fire ! Martin , Jones ! Get him ! - Nicholas ! - Stay down ! Stay there . - You were told to stay out of sight . - I couldn 't let him die . Okay , go ! Go ! Secure the area . [ Insects Buzzing ] Oh , my God . We got bodies . It doesn 't make sense . Three of Hailey 's militia men . Not one took less than a half a dozen rounds . And the ... hostages ? Tracks indicate that they were led out before the bloodbath . Sydney , he 's alive ... somewhere . You called him Sydney . How did you know his name ? I saw him on a news report . He 's the father of one of the hostages . His namejust ... stuck in my mind . Lieutenant , we 've got Hailey . [ Hailey ] No , don 't . Don 't ! Don 't let ' em get me ! Don 't let ' em get me . Don 't ! Don 't let ' em get me ! Don 't let ' em get me , please ! You gotta protect me . - From who ? - You gotta - Hailey ! Where is my son ? He 's unconscious . All right , get him stabilized . Find out everything he knows . Come on . We 'll find him . Jarod , thanks for responding so swiftly to my message . What message ? [ Broots ] Sydney did e-mail Jarod . " Nicholas has been kidnapped in Appalachia . Need your help . " - I can 't believe he 'd send it from here . - Meaning ? Meaning if someone put a tracer on it , then they could easily intercept it . - When 's the last time we heard from Lyle ? - Oh , man . - What ? - When I was at his office yesterday ... - Willie brought him an urgent memo . - Did he say what it was ? - No . - Huh . Well , Lyle acted like it was nothing . But he had that look in his eye , you know ? Like he 'd just eaten a raw steak . [ Lieutenant ] Immediate medevac extraction . [ Lieutenant ] Immediate medevac extraction . Three dead , one wounded , all A.F.M. My guess is that some rival militia got them . But the truth is , I have no idea where the hell the other hostages went to . We 're tryin 'to figure that out right now . Yeah . Yeah , I know that . I remember that look on your face when you were young - when you couldn 't find an answer . It doesn 't make any sense . There 's four sets of tracks , which means an outside group came in ... and ambushed the A.F.M. , but took the hostages ? - And then they killed the militia . - Executed them . Except for Hailey . He was shot three times ... but in a premeditated way . As if someone wanted him to survive ... so he could talk . So he could talk to me . I 've got him now . Don 't try to move . A medevac unit will be here soon . Now tell me about the men who took the hostages . [ Sighs , Mutters ] I never seen ' em before . I don 't want - I don 't want to see ' em again . Speak to me about my son . Did he get hurt ? Answer me , Hailey ! Did you hurt my son ? No . No , no , I - I didn 't hurt any hostage . - But he will . - Who ? The-The man who took ' em . The one who made me watch when he did the others and left me to die . - He 's crazy . - Who is he ? Lyle . - Oh ! - What ? - Lyle went to the Appalachians . - Oh ! [ Keypad Beeping ] This is Parker . Get the jet ready . Wait , what 's gonna happen to Sydney and his son ? For a shot at bringing Jarod back ? I wouldn 't put anything past Lyle . Yes , but ... what do you intend to do ? Whatever it takes . This man with the nine fingers - Where did he take the hostages ? He took ' em west . - Why would Lyle do this ? - He 's using Nicholas as bait ... to capture me . Jarod ? Talk to me . You were right . Hailey said a rival militia group did this . They 're holed up in a farmhouse in Pine Ridge . It 's about ... five miles due east of here . - Martin ? - [ Martin ] We 've got it , sir . McWood , stay with the prisoner . Jarod , you 're with me . Lieutenant , don 't you think I should stay with the prisoner ? I 'm the only one here with medical training in case ... something happens . All right , but see what else you can get out of Hailey ... and stay in communication with me through Base . - We 're out ofhere . - Why did you lie to them about where the hostages are ? I couldn 't put their lives at risk . - This is my fight . - Lyle killed your brother , I know . But now he 's putting my son 's life on the line , which makes it my fight . Nicholas is caught in the middle . You stay out of this . You 'll have to shoot me to keep me out of it . [ Vehicle Doors Closing , Engines Starting ] [ Vehicles Departing ] Hey ! Where you goin ' ? What about me ? Your wounds are stabilized . The medevac chopper will be here shortly . You can 't leave me alone ! What kind of lawman are you ? Oh , I 'm not really A.T.F. I was just ... pretending . So what happened to Hailey and his men after you got us out of the mine ? Oh , nothing too dramatic . We just ... tied ' em up , radioed the A.T.F. An extraction team will meet us here . - So what are you ? F.B. I ? - Something like that . Why don 't you all go up in the attic ... in case there 's more trouble , hmm ? Um , Nicholas ? Would you keep me company ? Why would Lyle want you to track him this far out ? This trail dead-ends at an abandoned mine shanty - no other access - which means he wants me walking in without a way of walking out . - Hmm . - It 's been a long time coming , him and me . Jarod , do you think revenge ... will put an end to the pain in your life ? He killed my brother . [ Groans ] That 's all right . Sit down here . How did I get to this ? A lifetime working for a corporation that takes my son away from me . And when my son is back in my life ... they kidnap him . What does that say about me , huh ? Who am I ? [ Groans ] There was a little boy that ... Nicholas was working with . He asked me to give this to your son . - He looks just like you . - [ Laughs ] I could see in that little boy 's eyes that Nicholas meant the world to him . Your son is a good man . He also gave me this to give to him . - Was it your father 's ? - It was his grandfather 's . I thought Nicholas might like a piece of his past . It 's important to know who your family is - who you are . Give it back to him . I know , Jarod . I know how much you 've missed in your life . Let 's go . Sheriff ! Nothin ' . Hailey must have lied toJarod . Did he ? Or did Jarod lie to us ? [ Grunts Angrily ] We 're goin ' back . [ Jarod ] Three Sweepers . - Only three . - You saw what they were capable of . The hostages must be inside the structure . Jarod , I really appreciate everything you 've done . - [ Grunts ] - I can 't risk you getting killed for me . Forgive me . Shouldn 't the extraction team be here by now ? There 's no accounting for punctuality . But as the old cliché goes , " All good things come to those who wait . " How 'd you lose your thumb ? [ Laughs ] I trusted the wrong people ... and I paid the price . [ Sydney ] You haven 't even made a down payment on your debt . Sydney ? - Are you okay ? - Thanks to Mr. Lyle . - If it weren 't for him , we 'd be dead . - Oh , Nicholas , you flatter me . Do you two know each other ? [ Moans ] Aah . Base One , it 's Jarod . Come in . [ Snapping ] [ Grunts ] Sleep tight . [ Jet Engine Whining , Dying Down ] [ Man ] Miss Parker . What are you doing here ? Hello , Roy . Take us to Lyle . - Now ! - Yes , Miss Parker . [ Engine Revving ] Shh . It 's okay . You 're safe now . Come on . Up the creek bed . Stay low and be quiet . Move , move . You seem angry , Sydney . - You 're using Nicholas as a bait to captureJarod . - Hell , yes ! Two birds , one stone . Victory from the jaws of defeat . Lemonade from lemons . You 've endangered my son 's life . Endangered ? You 're not listening . I saved him from the bad people . Sydney , Mr. Lyle is the reason I 'm safe - that we 're all safe . He 's a good man . [ Jarod ] Except for the fact that he 's a murderer . If you 're looking for Willie and the others ... they 're a little tied up right now . Revenge - It 's a great equalizer . Go ahead . I won 't give you another reason to kill me , Jarod . Oh , you think I need another reason ? Sydney , take Nicholas and go upstream . Find the others . They may need some help . - I don 't understand . - Your father will explain everything to you . Now go . - He 's right , Nicholas . Come . - Who the hell is he ? Someone we need to listen to . Jarod , you 're sure this is how it has to be ? I 'm sure . - [ Phone Ringing ] - This is Martin . Yeah . - Lieutenant , Base Camp 's got a message for you from Jarod . - Yeah ? I 'm a little curious . How did you know where the militia was holding them ? The Centre has strange bedfellows ... even among our inbred brethren . Needless to say , this - this is not how I had things planned . Oh , this is exactly how I planned it - in my mind ... every day ... since you killed my brother . - I never meant to hurt Kyle . - No . You wanted to kill me . Kyle just got in the way . I told you once : We can do great things together . That offer 's still on the table . You think you can bribe me ? Jarod , it 's not a bribe . Mr. Lyle , do you want your last breath on this planet to be a lie ? Now step to the center of the room . Now turn around . Turn ... around . - Drop to your knees . - Please , Jarod - On your knees ! So is this how it 's gonna be ? An execution without a trial ? - You didn 't give my brother a trial . - I didn 't - - It was self-defense . - So is this . Jarod , I know things . There are things I can tell you ... about your family ... about who you are - things no one else knows . If I die , all those answers die with me . Just let me walk out ofhere . [ Helicopter Propeller Whirring ] A Centre chopper . How 's that for karma ? - [ Gun Clicks ] - Bad . Ready ... aim - No , Jarod . Fire ! [ Faint Radio Chatter ] [ Man On Radio ] 107 Bravo , we copy . Over . Lyle ? Miss Parker . - You 've been talking toJarod ? - He 's here ! He went out that door ! What ? Well - Well , he 's not here now . - Well , find him ! - Another day . - What ? - Broots picked up a transmission from an A.T.F. Unit flying in . But he was right here ! What did he do to you ? Nothing . I had him , and those idiots outside let him escape . Whatever you say , Lyle . But now it 's time to go . No , we can 't just go . Listen to me . When the A.T.F. Walks in ... we don 't have an explanation for anything that 's happened in the last two days . If we don 't go now , the trail leads back to the Centre , and you know what that would mean . - [ Radio Chatter Continues ] - Could we - Could we go already ? Weird sense of justice , Jarod . [ Man ] I can 't believe you found us ! [ Chattering ] Get in ! Let 's get out of here , Roy . " I would eat them in a boat . I would eat them with a " - - Goat . - Goat ? That 's silly . [ Both Laugh ] You made it . Nicholas . Michelle . I 've been meaning to return this . - [ Chuckles Softly ] - [ Boy ] Nicholas , Nicholas . - Let 's read . - Not so fast . There 's someone I 'd like you to meet , Seth . - This is - - I 'm Sydney , Nicholas 's friend . No , Seth . He 's not my friend . He 's my father . Okay , here we go . " And I will " And I will - - " eat them in the rain . - " eat them in the rain . - " And in the dark . - " And in the dark . - " And on a train . - " And on a train . - " And in a car . - " And in a car . - " And in a tree . - " And in a tree . - " They are so good ... so good , you see . " They are so good " - I see . That 's very good , Seth . Sorry I couldn 't stick around to say good-bye . [ Sydney ] Jarod , I don 't know how to thank you for everything you did ... and - [ Chuckles ] I 'm sorry I hit you . It 's okay . Maybe it knocked a little sense into me . - Where 's Nicholas now ? - Back with his students . - He 's invited his mother and me to come down to visit again . - That 's nice . I mean , that will be really nice ... for your family . We 're hardly a family . Boy barely knows me . He knows - He knows you love him . You love ... him .

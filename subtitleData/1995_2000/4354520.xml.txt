 - [ Chirping , Quacking ] - [ Young Jarod ] It 's not working . The white duck isn 't accepting the mallard as part of her family . Conclusion ? The family bond is a primal impulse . - It 's unbreakable . - Very good , Jarod . - [ Quacking ] - My family 's gone , Sydney . If I ever left here , would anybody want me ? - What is this place ? - I got your back , Miss Parker . Looks like Monkey Boy had some time on his hands . Oh . " Urban Combat Basics ... The Best of Enemy Neutralization , Hand-To-Hand Combat and You . " - Our little egghead 's turning into a regular weekend warrior . - You shot me . - In the head . - You never looked better . [ Miss Parker ] Something you want to share with us , Syd ? Syd ? - Syd , you all right ? - Oh , yeah . All clear . [ Scoffs ] What is this , testosterone headquarters ? What do you think all this means ? Well , it looks likeJarod is preparing to go to war . [ Woman Whimpering ] You better hope hubby shows with the ransom . Quiet . - See anything ? - I don 't see nothin ' . - No cops ? - Just hustlers and crackheads . - [ Whimpering ] - I think we 're gonna be okay . - Grab the door . ! Check the bedroom . ! - Go , go , go . ! - Police ! Freeze ! - Down ! Down ! - Up against the wall . ! - Check the hallway . ! Set it up . ! Clear it . ! My name is Jarod . You 're going to be just fine . Central , this is T-14 . Two male suspects in custody . [ Sobbing ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Jarod . Nice work last night , partner . No shots , no casualties . SWAT loves pitching shutouts . Well , it 's a pleasure to be here , Sergeant Stephens . It 's an honor to be part of the T-14 Squad . Although , I 'm still trying to figure out what the " T ' " stands for . " Ten-to-life , " if you ask the losers in city lockup . - " Turbo , " if you ask the chief . - Turbo Squad . - Turbo Squad . - We 're a well-oiled machine . - Based on your moves last night , you 'll fit in just fine . - Amen . I heard about the shooting incident . Lieutenant Lange is gonna be a tough act to follow . Dan was a hell of a guy . He 's gonna be missed . That cop killer better hope I don 't find his worthless ass . That 's all I got to say . Well , these precinct picnics used to be all kinds of fun ... before all this bitching and moaning . Tracking another hot lead , Detective ? You guys are making Lange out to be some sort ofhero . Truth is , he was a fool . - Take it someplace else . - Truth hurts , huh , Stephens ? - No . This does . - Hey , come on ! Take it easy , all right ? - Hey . Hey . - Why do you keep defending this guy ? He threw himself in between the shooter and his partner ! He was a good cop ! Lange was a hot dog , all right ? And it got him killed . Just a - Cody . Cody , honey ? [ Stephens ] Right in front of Lange 's kids . That was nice . - That was really nice . - I didn 't know . It 's gonna be all right . Je t 'aime . Ah , Michelle . - I love you too . - [ Door Opens ] Hey , Sydney . Routine scans from last week . You okay , Sydney ? - Broots , can I trust you ? - Absolutely . I told you about the dream I keep having about Miss Parker , didn 't I ? Hmm . I need your help to find a person . Her name is Michelle Lucca . Okay . This is everything I remember about her . Broots , this is important to me . Please be discreet . Okay , Sydney . You know you can count on me . Hate to break up the coffee klatch , but Broots is needed on Sublevel 5 right away . - Oh , okay . Duty calls . - [ Sydney Chuckles ] - Everything okay , Syd ? - Fine , Miss Parker . Fine . - In a hurry , Broots ? - Oh , hi . What ? I want the paper Sydney gave you . - You were listening at the door ? - It was an accident . Call a cop . The paper ? " Michelle Lucca " ? - [ Broots Sighs ] - Hmm . Dr. Pavlov 's been drooling ever since he found that note from Jarod . Do exactly what Sydney asked . Okay . If Sydney 's protecting Jarod for some reason , I need to know about it . - You got it ? - Yeah . Oh , and Broots ? I can 't wait to hear about that dream of yours . [ Stephens ] And we 're clear . What the hell were you shooting at , Mooney ? Cleveland ? You okay ? Yeah . [ Panting ] I need some air . What 's with him ? I don 't know . Nice choice of simulation scenario there , Jarod . Well , simulations are sort of my specialty . You and Cooke , you showed some stellar shooting . Just backing up the team . - What 's up ? - I really dropped the ball back there . Well , maybe the simulation was a little too close to home . Maybe it reminded you of the day you got shot . The day Dan Lange was killed . - It 's only been two weeks . - It was like I was living it again . Like I could hear the rounds goin ' off , Lange screaming , the pain cutting into my leg . Classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress . Have you talked to someone ? Well , I 'm doin ' mandatory sessions with the department shrink . I just can 't get it out of my head . Stress can be triggered by a number of factors - anger , fear , guilt . - Guilt ? - About how Dan Lange died to save your life . Look , your physical wounds are healing . Maybe it 's time you started dealing with your emotional ones . They 'll heal when I catch the man who murdered my partner . We run these simulations to hone our tactical skills . The same thing can work for healing emotions . [ Mooney ] We got a call about a botched bank robbery . The suspect drove three blocks , abandoned his car , and he broke into the roller rink . Lange and I made entry there , just behind those lockers . We moved toward the bleachers , but we were pinned by gunfire coming from the box ... up there . I had Lange 's flank , but then I was hit in the leg and went down . Dan stood between me and the shooter andjust kept firing . It sounded like we were in the middle of a war . Stephens and Cooke had taken up cover positions over there . - You could see them ? - I didn 't have to . It 's standard tactical procedure . Anyway , the next thing I knew , Lange was shot and went down . That 's when I saw the shooter . He stood up in the light . White male , six feet , athletic build , goatee and a baseball cap . Son of a bitch knew what he was doin 'too . They found a pile of M1.32 shell casings . Armor-piercing rounds . Cop killers . Tore through Lange 's vest like paper . They call us the Turbo Squad . Pistons in the same engine . But if we don 't fire at the right time , that engine breaks down . People die . - [ Miss Parker ] Anything on Michelle Lucca ? - [ Broots ] No , on Michelle Lucca . Yes , on Michelle Lucca Stamatis . Married and living in New York state . - But that 's not the screwy part . - Why doesn 't that surprise me ? Well , there 's absolutely no record of - of a Michelle Lucca ... ever having existed before moving to Albany in 1974 . No driver 's license , no birth certificate , nothing . Broots , look deeper . Now , you can give Sydney her address but nothing else . We need to find that note Jarod left for Sydney in that cabin . Well , I 'm - I 'm sure he hid it pretty well . You haven 't seen it , have you , Broots ? No way . No . Miss Parker , uh ... - this woman obviously means a lot to Sydney . - Your point ? Whatever happened to respecting someone 's privacy ? Look , I know how much you care about Sydney . Hell , the old goat 's even grown on me a little . - [ Both Chuckling ] - But this might have something to do with Jarod . And that is what 's important . Hmm ? [ Siren Blaring ] [ Female Dispatcher ] This is Central Dispatch to T-14 . Suspects have entered the roller rink at 21 Bay Shore Road . Assume armed and dangerous . Over . This is Lange . Officer Mooney and I have entered the building . Officer Stephens and Cooke have taken flank position . Over . [ Dispatcher ] Copy entry . We 'll keep this channel open , T-14 . Over . [ Gunshots ] - Request immediate backup . ! Officer down . ! - Repeat , 14 ? - [ Gunshots ] - [ Mooney ] Lange 's been hit . ! Officer down . ! Officer down . ! [ Dispatcher ] Copy . Officer down . Backup en route . Over . - [ Static ] - Respond , T-14 . Over . Officer Lange , please respond . Officer Lange , this is Dispatch . Please respond . This is Lange . I 'm hit . I - I can 't feel my legs . [ Dispatcher ] Daniel , talk to me . Stay with me . The ambulance is on the way . - Liz , I 'm cold . I 'm so cold . - Daniel , stay with me . Liz , tell my boys , tell Jordan and Cody , Dad loves them . You can tell them that yourself , Daniel . Just hang on . - [ Static ] - Daniel ? Oh , my God . [ Children Chattering ] [ Girl ] You want to ride with me ? [ Male Dispatcher ] 1937 Davidson . 1937 Davidson Avenue . Uh , see a complaint in Apartment 3-H , as in Henry . [ Liz ] Daniel , stay with me . [ Lange ] Liz , tell my boys , tell Jordan and Cody , Dad loves them . [ Female Dispatcher , Indistinct ] Ceramic figurines with vegetation for hair . Hmm . - Chia Pets . - Pets ? Yeah . I 've never had much of a green thumb , and animals hate me . It seemed like a logical solution . Hmm . I 'm Jarod . Dan Lange 's replacement . I don 't think it 's possible to replace a man like Lieutenant Lange . No . You were working dispatch on the night Lieutenant Lange was killed . I was the last person to speak to him . That must have been very difficult for you ... considering how you and Dan felt about each other . - What ? - You two were in love . I heard the dispatch tape . I could hear it in your voice , the way you spoke to each other . It must have been very comforting for Dan to have you there at the end . [ Liz ] Daniel lost his wife just over a year ago . Since then , it 's just been him and the boys . You were close to his sons ? Yeah . Very . The only family they have left are Daniel 's parents in Seattle . I know they 've been trying to contact them about taking custody ofJordan and Cody . The trouble is , they 've been traveling in Europe for over a month . I 'm really gonna miss those kids . It 's difficult , losing people that we love . Yeah . I haven 't even cleaned out his locker yet . I know it sounds silly . It - It just makes it seem so final , you know ? So real . I don 't want to forget him . I want to do something , you know , make a difference . I at least want to get those cop-killer bullets off the street . Did Dan happen to mention anyone who might be supplying that type of ammunition on the street ? He did mention a man named Petrovka . [ Speaking Russian ] [ Russian Continues ] [ Sighs ] Vladimir Petrovka ... a local Russian connected to the Moscow Mafia . Interpol thinks he might be responsible for smuggling ... cop-killer ammunition into the States , among other things . That 's definitely him . I remember hearing his name a lot just before Daniel made up his mind to leave the team . Daniel was planning on leaving Turbo Squad ? Yeah . It was strange . Um , the last few weeks before the shooting ... he had become so distant , as ifhe knew something was - was gonna happen . - That is strange . - He said he was leaving Turbo because he was burnt out . But I think it was because of the boys . And Jordan and Cody were the world to him . Now they might not have anybody . [ Broots ] Michelle Lucca . The more I look , the less I find . I accessed C.I.A. , F.B.I. and - - He 's not there . - Interpol files . None of them have any record of her having ever existed prior to 1974 . So , I got to thinking ... who else could wipe out a person 's past so efficiently ? [ Sighs ] She worked for the Centre . Score one for Miss Parker . She was a clinical psychologist who worked very closely with Sydney on the Pretender Project . - She 's beautiful , isn 't she ? - Figure out how this connects to that noteJarod left . Uh , I 'll get on this right away then . - You 're hiding something , Broots . - Uh , what ? I think you heard me . I promised Sydney he could trust me . - And you feel like a heel for lying to him , right ? - Yes . So , by giving me the rest of what you know ... it doesn 't make you any more despicable than you already are . - Right ? - Right . Let 's go to my office . Jordan and Cody remain withdrawn , but that 's to be expected ... considering they lost their father . I understand that the boys grandparents might take custody . Yeah . They 're currently out of the country . We 're still trying to make contact . What happens if they 're unable to take custody ? What happens to Jordan and Cody then ? Statistically , older children , particularly ones with , uh , emotional scars ... are very difficult to place . If I were left here , would anybody want me ? That 's some gear . You must be good at this game . Would you like to play ? Whatever . - You 're on SWAT . - Yes , I am . - So , did you know our dad ? - No . But I hear he was a great guy . Do you guys remember anything strange happening before your father 's accident ? - He yelled one night . - Yelled ? - At the men . - Me and Cody had gone to bed ... - and we woke up when we heard them fighting . - Did you see these men ? - No . But we could hear them . - Dad was real mad . He kept telling them that he didn 't want to be involved and that they should leave . It was a few nights before ... you know . You okay ? Every day before he went to work ... he said nothing would happen to him . He promised . Cody , your father died saving another police officer . There 's nothing more heroic than that . [ Broots ] This is so wrong . Sydney should be entitled to a private life . Keep looking . He was poking around here when I was here before - - I got it . - What ? Oh , God . - Oh , Miss Parker . - Sydney , we were just - Just looking for you because I need your report on the surveillance scans . - I 'll put them on your desk . - Thank you . - Any news , Broots ? - Almost . Hmm . - [ Sighs ] - [ Door Closes ] Give me that ! Well , it 's a birth certificate . Michelle Lucca is named as the mother , but there 's no one listed as the father . Sydney ? I was in a cover position near the back bleachers with Officer Cooke when we heard gunfire . We immediately returned the fire . I was hit almost immediately . That 's when Dan - I mean Officer Lange - began to return fire . The next thing I knew he was down , and I could see the shooter ... the guy with the goatee and the baseball cap , looking right at me . It felt like the firefight lasted 20 minutes . When we stopped firing , we heard another weapon . It sounded like one of our MP5 nine-millimeters ... coming from the bleachers in front of us . It felt like the firefight lasted 20 minutes . - [ Tape Rewinding ] - It felt like the firefight lasted - ... felt like the firefight - ... felt like the firefight - [ Liz ] I can 't believe they 've already reopened the roller rink . They haven 't even fixed all the damage yet . Liz , what kind of weapons were Mooney and Lange carrying the day of the shooting ? Uh , nine-millimeter handguns . Stephens and Cooke ? - M16 assault rifles . Standard team issue . - Right . [ Lange ] We 're under fire . ! We 're under fire . ! Take cover . ! I 'm hit . I can 't feel my legs . [ Liz ] Daniel , hang on . I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have brought you here . Why did you ask about the weapons ? [ Sighs ] Because maybe Mooney and Lange didn 't have a backup after all . What are you talking about ? Stephens and Cooke were right behind them . Were they ? [ Jarod ] Cooke said it was a firefight . Yeah ? So ? So , if there was such a vicious exchange of gunfire ... why aren 't there more bullet holes ? - And why are all these bullet holes the exact same size ? - You 've lost me . An M16 slug leaves a slightly smaller bullet hole than a nine-millimeter . It 's not something you would notice unless you were looking for it . Yet none of these bullet holes come from an assault weapon . Stephens and Cooke , they 're expert marksmen . I 've seen them shoot . That box is only 30 yards away , yet they missed their target . - Why is that ? - Are you saying they never fired at the shooter ? I 'm saying that maybe ... just maybe , there was never a shooter in the first place . Then who killed Daniel ? [ Jarod ] Maybe ... Stephens and Cooke . The birth certificate is from 1974 for a boy named Nicholas . He was born about eight months after Michelle Lucca left the Centre . I didn 't think he knew what to do with that part of his anatomy . - Now he 's got a son out there . - Which is why we should leave it alone . Give the moral shtick a rest , Broots . I wouldn 't want anyone from the Centre getting involved in my daughter 's life . - We have to back off , Miss Parker . - Mmm . First Sydney shows some testosterone , now you . It must be in the water . Would you put that away ? The Centre made Michelle disappear . Now don 't - don 't you think they 've done enough to Sydney ? I told you . This isn 't about Sydney . It 's aboutJarod . You say that . I just wonder if you believe it . [ Siren ] A voice from beyond the grave . This is Lieutenant Daniel P. Lange , badge number 44562 . The date is March 4 . The time is ... 11.18 p.m. My location is 570 Franklin Avenue . I 'm currently in observations of Officers Stephens , Cooke and Mooney ... with one Vladimir Petrovka , a known criminal with ties to the Russian mob ... and convictions on weapons and drug charges . This is the second meeting in which I have witnessed the exchange of money . I plan to turn these surveillance tapes over to the district attorney 's office ... as soon as I 've collected enough evidence . I just hope I can stop this before anybody gets hurt . You may have been too late , Dan . But I won 't be . [ Doorbell Rings ] Nick , you 're - [ Sydney ] When I returned to the Centre , your desk had been cleared out ... your projects reassigned , and your apartment was empty . You left without a trace . I had only this . Je t 'aime . Michelle , if you loved me , how could you leave without saying good-bye ? Because I loved you . I received a copy of a birth certificate . A boy named Nicholas , born eight months after you left . No father listed . Michelle , am I the father ? Sydney . Well , am I ? Do you remember that Easter weekend we spent at the cabin ? Mm-hmm . Well , after a few weeks , uh , I got up one morning , I wasn 't feeling very well ... so I made an appointment with my doctor and - You were pregnant . I was so excited . For me , for us . I rushed to Blue Cove to tell you . When I got to the Centre , I was stopped . By whom ? By a man that I 'd never even seen before . I don 't know how , but somehow he knew about our child . He gave me a choice , Sydney . The Centre would relocate me ... set up a substantial trust fund for Nicholas if ... I promised never to see or speak with you again . And ... if you refused ? He said you would be in a terrible accident . He said the Centre couldn 't take a chance on you becoming distracted ... compromising your-your objectivity toward the Pretender Project . Sydney , I was afraid . After I left , and Nicholas was born ... I met someone . I got married . He raised our child as his own . We chose never to tell him the truth . We can tell him now . At what cost ? He 's such a bright , splendid young man with a great future . He 's going to be a teacher like you . And he 's going to be back any minute now . I have to go . I hope you understand , Sydney . [ Sighs ] At least this time we can say good-bye . Sydney ? The inscription on the watch ? I meant it . Forever . - Hi . How you doing ? - Good . - This is Jeremy . - Nice to meet you . I found this in a box of old case files . Vladimir Petrovka . He was arrested two years ago by - Stephens , Cooke and Mooney ? That 's when Petrovka began his relationship with the Turbo Squad . This is before Daniel joined the team . Petrovka got off on a technicality . Now , Stephens and the others get paid to tip Petrovka off about raids . Their father found out and confronted them . That must have been the fight the boys overheard . He was going to turn them in . So they killed him . It 's not over , Liz . Not yet . Going somewhere ? I saw the birth certificate , Syd . Michelle said the Centre threatened to have me killed ... if I ever found out about my son . She was told to leave . They stole my life , Parker . ! Just like they stoleJarod 's and Angelo 's and - Mine ? If you leave now , then you 'll never find out who did this . You 're not-You 're not really gonna leave , are you , Sydney ? Apparently not . If you knew about the birth certificate , why didn 't you confront me ? Everyone deserves a life . Even you . [ Stephens ] So why the hell couldn 't you hit it with a.45 ? [ Cooke ] I know you weren 't talkin 'about my target . - I was talking about your target . - Oh , no , man ! - I was talking about your.45. - All right . We 'll meet at the tactical range in 20 . - We 'll just prove it . - All right . [ Liz ] T-14 . We have a confirmed sighting of a Joe Doe ... male matching description of suspect wanted in the murder of Lieutenant Daniel Lange . 21 Bay Shore Road . Shots have been fired . That 's the roller rink . Uh , Dispatch ? Dispatch , this is Sergeant Stephens . - Did I read you correctly ? - Affirmative . Unit on scene requests SWAT intervention immediately . Well , come on ! Let 's move ! Blood . Looks like our cop killer 's back . All right , we go in together this time . - Jarod , you wait for my call ! - [ Mooney ] What the hell 's he doin ' ? Forget him . Let 's move . Cooke , stay with me on point . Mooney , cover our flank . Yes , sir . ! - I don 't like this . - Neither do I. Let 's go ! Ready ? Go ! Jarod , this is Stephens . Respond . Respond , damn it ! That 's an order ! - [ Cooke ] Where did he go ? - I 'll take care of him later . Keep your eyes open . [ Siren Blaring ] Move out . [ Gunfire ] Hold your fire ! It 's a damn target . - [ Rock ] - What is this ? He 's not going down ! I 'm shooting straight at him ! Blanks . They 're blanks ! Somebody switched the ammo ! - Who the hell are you ? - You know me . I 'm the man each of you created . The shooter in the baseball cap with the goatee . The man you made up to cover for the murder of Dan Lange . What are you talking about ? Lieutenant Lange found out about your little payoffs from Petrovka . When he confronted you , you killed him with armor-piercing shells . Cop killers . It just so happens I brought some with me tonight . [ Screaming ] Please ! Stop ! You set up Lange , didn 't you ? - It was Stephens ' idea ! - Shut up , Mooney . You left two boys without a father . And for what ? - For money ? - [ Gunshots ] You better hope you don 't miss , or we 'll blow you away just like we did Lange . - Did you get all that , Liz ? - Every last word . Forgot to switch the ammo in this one , didn 't you ? What are you gonna do , Jarod ? You gonna shoot me ? Huh ? If I go , you go . [ Siren Blaring , Distant ] - It 's over , Stephens . - [ Cooke ] He - He 's right . [ Mooney ] There 's been enough killing , Stephens . [ Siren Approaching ] [ Gun Hitting Floor ] You kids had a wonderful time [ Jarod ] I 'm glad they finally got ahold of Dan 's parents . - [ Liz ] Yep . They 're gonna take the boys back to Seattle . They seem like really nice people . Well , Jordan and Cody , they 're going to miss you . The Langes said I could visit anytime I wanted . I just wish they were moving closer . I 've got a lot I want to tell them about their father . Well , you could always move there . And do what ? It 's not like they need another dispatcher in Seattle . Well , it 's funny that you should mention that . Because I put a call into the Seattle P. D ... and it just so happens they 're looking for a good person ... to fill a recently vacated switchboard position . So , if you want the job , you start in two weeks . Thank you . No . Thank you . For what ? For making sure those kids knew they had someone that cared about them . I hear you 're goin ' home . - Grandma and Grandpa have a farm . - With real horses . Real horses ? Wow . - Listen , will you make me a promise ? - What ? No matter how busy or how crazy your lives get in the future ... always remember that your dad loved you very much . - You promise ? - Promise . Promise . Bye . [ Miss Parker ] Where 's Syd ? I haven 't seen him all morning . [ Broots ] He said he had something important to do up in Albany . Hey , look , Miss Parker . Don 't ! Back off . Hey , look . ! [ Chuckles ] It 's Chia Me . A little less hair than I 'm used to - Well , like I said before , you never looked better . [ Coughs ] [ Bell Chiming ] Nice job . See you next time , okay ? Erica , I was going to talk to you about Thoreau 's principles . I think your essays could be a little bit more in-depth . Uh , maybe if you could look at the , uh , third chapter , okay ? There 's nojob more important than teaching . That 's what they keep telling me . Enjoy your life . It passes so quickly . I 'm sorry . Do I know you from somewhere ? I 'm afraid you don 't . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - This is Sydney . - Did you find your son ? - Yes , I did . - Do you remember a long time ago ... - I asked you if a family would ever want me ? - I do . Well , I thought it took blood to bond people . But I 've learned it also takes something else . It takes love . [ Beeps ] I hope you 're right , Jarod .

 [ Young Miss Parker ] Tell me about love , Mama . [ Mrs. Parker , Chuckling ] What do you want to know ? Will I ever find someone to love , like you found Daddy ? - I think you will . - But how will I know when I 'm in love ? Mmm . It 's different for everybody . I used to get light-headed when your father looked at me . Was Daddy very handsome ? [ Laughs ] Mmm . Handsome , yes . Beautiful . But don 't ever tell him I said so ... because I certainly wouldn 't want his head to swell . [ Both Laughing ] I hope the man I fall in love with makes me feel light-headed . I hope so too , baby . But until then , you 're all mine ! [ Giggling ] Mama , when are we - Mama ? [ Echoing ] Mama ? Mama ? [ Whimpering ] Mama ? Don 't leave me . Mama , don 't leave me . Mama ! [ Exhales ] - Come with me . - Oh , to Oregon ? Why not ? [ Shower Running ] Use all the hot water , and I 'll kill you . Mama , will I ever find someone to love , like you found Daddy ? I think you will . I know it isn 't easy living with somebody like me . I have more baggage than an airport . But I want this to work . I 'm committed ... to making you and me work . So ... if you still want me to come to Portland with you ... I will . I want to . I just poured my guts out ... all over the imported Italian tile . The least you could give me is a grunt . Tommy ? Tommy ? - Thomas . - [ Kicks Bundle ] Oh , my - Tommy . Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Tommy ! Tommy . Can you hear me , baby ? Oh , my God . No , no , no . This isn 't happening . It 's okay . I 'm here . It 's okay . Oh , my God . - What are you doin ' up there ? - Please ! I need help here ! - Police . - No , wait . - No , wait ! Wait ! - There 's been a murder up on Briar Road . - You don 't understand ! - 876.Just send somebody ! - No , I ain 't giving 'my name . - Tommy . Oh , don 't leave me . Please don 't leave me . [ Crying ] [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Man ] How long was it between the time you found Mr. Gates 's body ... and this - this mystery trashman called 911 ? I told you . It was just a couple of seconds . You say you never saw this man before ? Never . He was white , 5 ' 10 " , 170 pounds . He had a truck full of trash and junk . What color was the truck ? Green . Maybe brown . Green . Maybe brown . I did have other things on my mind . I can imagine . You sure you don 't want a lawyer , Miss Parker ? It is your right . I have nothing to hide . - Were you and the victim sleeping together ? - Excuse me ? It 's a simple question . Were you and the deceased having sexual relations ? Tommy and I were committed to each other . We were gonna spend our lives together . Mm . Then ... how do you explain a one-way ticket to Oregon in his jacket ? - Come with me , Parker . - Oh , to Oregon ? - Why not ? - Well , first of all , I have a career . Oh , right . Same career that gave you an ulcer . I learned a long time ago the corporate ladder is a dead end . It 's not just the job . My family ? - You buy a plane ticket . You visit . - You don 't know my family . Look , it 's just not a decision I can make right now ... here , in my bathrobe . What are you scared of ? Nothing . Tommy was planning on renovating a house ... and ... I was planning on meeting him later . You know , it 's clear someone broke into my home . Tommy heard them . He - He followed them outside and was shot . Well , that 's-That 's one way it could have happened . - What other way ? - [ Knocking ] Excuse me . - Do you own a gun , Miss Parker ? - What ? We found this empty holster in your living room . - Do you own a firearm , ma 'am ? - Yes . - What kind ? - Smith Wesson nine-millimeter . That 's a nice piece . Why would a woman like yourself need a weapon like that ? I work as a consultant for an international corporation . I travel . It makes me feel safe . You work out at that - that complex outside of town , don 't you ? - What 's it called ? - The Centre . The Centre . Well , I 've always been curious about the kind of work you people do out there . - It 's a think tank . - I 'll be damned . And just what kind of stuff are you people thinkin ' about ? You know , I don 't see how this has anything to do with Thomas 's murder . The preliminary coroner 's report says ... that Mr. Gates was killed by a single gunshot to the head . The wound appears to have been made by a nine-millimeter handgun . And as of now , your weapon is missing in action . You positive about that lawyer ? [ Broots ] Miss Parker , we 're really sorry about Thomas . He was - I mean , he seemed like a really nice guy . This way . I can 't believe you did this . I meant , let the local authorities get involved in Centre business . Look , no disrespect intended ... but we both know the danger of exposing the Centre to outsiders . It wasn 't my decision . Someone else called the police . - Who ? - A trashman . He was outside my house - I 'm sorry you had to go through this alone . - Did you find my father ? - He was in Montreal on business . He caught the first plane home . He should be on the ground as we speak . Parker , can we get you something ? I want Tommy back . [ Man On TV ] Our own Ken Johnson will have tomorrow 's weather forecast ... coming up later in the 10.00 hour . We now switch to Kate Scofield with a report on an incident from earlier today . [ Woman ] Our News 17 was on the scene of an apparent homicide ... in the exclusive community of Blue Cove . Details are sketchy , but what we know is there was an apparent robbery attempt ... that ended in the death of a 36-year-old white male ... identified as Thomas Gates . The owner of the house has yet to be identified . Also , police have not confirmed any eyewitnesses to the crime ... and have told us that the investigation will continue throughout the night . We hope to have more details on tonight 's news at 11 : 00 . Back to you , Matt . [ Crying ] Honey , have you seen my red flannel shirt ? I need more information . Uh , red , flannel . - Doesn 't ring a bell . - [ Laughing ] You 're always wearing my shirts . How come ? 'Cause they smell like you . - I like that . - Mmm . Well , I need something to wear to work . So , take it ... if you think you 're man enough . [ Laughing ] I 'll tell you what . I will make you a deal . - I 'm open for negotiations . - Yeah ? When I die , I 'll leave you all my shirts , okay ? Hey , hey . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Don 't worry . I 'm not goin ' anywhere . Okay ? Hmm ? [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Sighing , Sniffling ] - Hello . - I saw the news report about Thomas . Are you okay ? - It 's too soon to tell . - They said it was an unsolved homicide . - Do the police have any suspects ? - One . If you include me . You must be close if you saw the local report on television . Always the hunter , Miss Parker . I barely have enough ... energy to sleep ... let alone chase you around . I appreciate the call , Jarod . But , if you don 't mind , I have a lot to think about . Like finding out who did this . You might want to take a closer look at the people around you . And what exactly am I looking for ? Missing pieces , Miss Parker . Missing pieces . [ Beeps ] [ Doorbell Rings ] [ Sighs ] Angel , we came as soon as we could . Chinese tea with lemon and honey . - The way you liked when you were little . - Maybe later , Daddy . Oh . Uh , you betcha . You can 't imagine the shock when we heard the news . And then to find out that the local police got involved . I explained that . Right , right . The mysterious trashman . Lyle says it looks like a screwed-up robbery . - It looks that way . - You don 't believe that ? There 's still some ... missing pieces to put together . I find it hard to believe that somebody breaks into your house ... rifles through your drawers ... then shoots your lover point-blank in the head , and you don 't hear a sound . The shock took away her edge . It happens . To a trained professional ? You got something to say , lady ? Say it . Emotions are making you soft . What would you know about emotions ? At least I know how to protect the ones I love . At least I know how to protect the ones I love . - That 's enough . - That 's right . The Triumvirate says " Jump . " And you say , " On who ? " - I said that 's enough ! - [ Knocking ] Detective Miller . - Always nice to have family in a time of need . - What can I do for you ? Thought you might like to know we caught a man about a mile from here . - A man ? - He was carrying a nine-millimeter Smith Wesson ... and was covered in blood - Thomas Gates 's blood . - [ Miller ] His name 's Wade Dawson . - He has a criminal record ? Goin 'back to his teens . Dawson 's a small-time drug dealer - street-corner stuff . I 've busted him half a dozen times for B E myself . When we picked him up , he had this in his backpack . - My gun . - Dawson claims he 's never seen it before . Truth is , he was so wasted when we found him , he barely knew his own name . - You said he had Thomas 's blood on him . - That 's right . The same as on the gun . There 's something else you should know , Miss Parker . When we went through Dawson 's stuff , we found these . - He was watching us ? - Dawson was probablyjust out for a thrill . Then he saw the opportunity to rob your place , and Gates - Thomas was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . [ On Speaker ] Look , man , I 'm tryin 'to cooperate . - Just tell me what you want to know . - Good . - What do you want to know ? - Okay . Tell me again about the woman in the pictures . I didn 't draw no pictures , man . Do you think you could , uh - You think you could hook a brother up with a little ... situation in a - [ Muttering ] - You know what I mean ? - When was the last time you fixed ? Um , an hour . I mean - I mean , a year . Listen , man , I 'll tell you whatever you need to know in here ... if you , um , just help me out just a little bit , you know . 'Cause I can 't go from grade " A " juice , man , to nothing . Okay ? ' Cause it 's not human . - I 'll tell you what . - Hmm ? You tell me about that guy you popped . - Aw ! - I 'll see what I can do . Popped ? I didn 't pop no guy . You got the wrong man , man . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . - The murder weapon was found in your backpack . - [ Murmuring ] You had the victim 's blood all over your coat . You listen to me . Now you either start working with me ... or I swear to God you will spend the rest of your life in prison . - Can I ask you something , man ? - What ? Do you think that they have the ... Playboy Channel up there in prison ? [ Laughing ] - You son of a bitch . - Miss Parker . No ! I 'll kill you myself ! Get her off me ! - Get off him ! - Tell the truth , you bastard ! - [ All Shouting ] - She 's crazy , man ! Help me up ! Get her away from me ! - [ Man ] Get her outta there ! - Tell the truth ! Tell the truth ! - [ Detective ] All right , all right , all right . - She 's crazy , man . [ Sobbing ] [ Bell Tolling ] [ Minister ] As we grieve , we must remember that death is not the end ... but the beginning . And so we commit the body ofThomas Gates to the earth ... and release his soul to heaven . May his Heavenly Father hold him ... and love him for eternity . - Amen . - Amen . Thomas didn 't have any family . His parents died when he was in college . So it 's - It 's my honor to say a few things about him . [ Voice Breaks ] Tommy - He was a - He was a good man , caring man . In the short time I knew him , I never ceased to be amazed ... by the unselfish way he lived his life . He didn 't have many material possessions . He used to say we don 't own material things ... that they own us . But he was rich in so many other ways ... in ways that only a loving human being can be . He saw the best in people , and he embraced it . He made people feel special , like - like they were the most important person in his life . I wish I would 've met you when I was a little boy . And why is that ? Because my whole life - everything that I 've ever done or felt up until this moment - was wasted ... because you weren 't a part of it . I love you , Parker . [ Miss Parker ] I will think ofhim often . And I will love him forever . Sweet dreams , my love . [ Woman Singing Ballad ] [ Continues ] - [ Ends ] - Is there anything else I can get you ? Another round and - and a time machine . Actually , I was thinking more along the lines of a cup of coffee ... and a cab . [ Laughing ] - What 's so funny ? - This . You and me . I spend 80 % of my life hunting you ... and the second I stop , you sit down in my lap . I guess , as much as we 'd both like to deny it ... we 're both just two pieces of the same puzzle . And quite a grotesque little puzzle it 's turned out to be . [ Sighs ] Have a drink with me , Jarod , while I 'm still buying ' . Another round here for me and - Oh , come on , good buddy , Jarod . Boy Genius . [ Laughing ] I realize you 're in pain ... and I 'm very sorry for what has happened . But if you 're going to find out who really killed Thomas ... you 're going to have to keep your wits about you . See ? You 're not so smart after all . 'Cause they caught the guy , so there are no more missing pieces . They just need to get him to spill his guts ... and then we all ... live happily ever after . Listen to me . Their suspect isn 't going to talk . What do you mean ? The man the police think killed Thomas Gates ... died of a drug overdose in his cell less than one hour ago . Missing pieces , Miss Parker . Missing pieces . [ Broots ] Look at the positive side . At least you don 't have to go through the pain of a trial . [ Clears Throat ] Don 't you get it ? Dawson ended this on his terms . I wanted to look him in the eye when they sentenced him to death ... to have ... my face be the last thing he saw before he was sent to hell . [ Moans ] - I think you should speak to someone about this feeling . - You mean a shrink , don 't you ? Thanks , Syd , but I 'll leave the mental masturbation to someone else . [ Chattering ] - What I need now are answers . - What sort of answers ? Dawson 's a lifelong junkie . He takes drugs like we breathe air . And then suddenly - Suddenly he overdoses while in police custody ? Mm-hmm . What next ? Miller told me Dawson lived in a shed down by the railroad tracks . - You 're not gonna go snooping around his place , are you ? - No . We 're gonna go snoopin' around his place . [ Flies Buzzing ] [ Gasps ] Oh , man . It smells like a toilet in here , Miss Parker . Oh . There was some pretty sick stuff going on in here . Unorthodox lifestyle . [ Broots ] How can a human being live in a place like this ? Whatever lived here was no human . Syd . - What is it ? - Pharmaceutical-grade morphine . Hundred-percent pure . Here 's some more . Detective Miller said Dawson was a two-bit hustler , a sidewalk dealer . - So ? - So the kind of drugs that we 're looking at ... are next to impossible to find on the street . Look at this place . Dawson slept in his own filth . There 's no way he 'd know where to score this stuff . - He had a supplier . - One with powerful connections . Broots , I want you to take these vials back to the Centre . - See if you can blow any prints off them . - Okay . I 'm outta here . What are you looking for , Miss Parker ? The missing pieces . You never talk about her . She was my whole life . It 's a long story . My folks died when I was 20 . Yeah , I was so ... angry . I just ... walked away . Now I don 't have any photos of them . I wish now that I did . It 's just a picture . It does make me feel connected to her , like she 's protecting me . Yeah . I 'm sorry , baby . Miss Parker ? Excuse me . - I finished checking the drug vials for prints . - And ? Other than Dawson , the only thing I could get was a smudged partial . - Any chance of isolating it ? - Um , no . I 'm afraid not . I 'm sorry . Hey , Broots . Thank you . [ Cell Phone Rings ] [ Sighs ] What ? It feels like the big picture is beginning to come into focus . Then why do I feel so blind ? - What did you find at Wade Dawson 's place ? - How 'd you know we went ? - What did you find ? - A zoo no animal would live in . - Is that all ? - There were drug vials . Pharmaceutical-grade narcotics . - Morphine . - That 's right . Jarod , what are you trying to tell me ? That Wade Dawson was murdered . The autopsy showed morphine in his blood . He O.D. ' d . The police told me that . There were also traces of strychnine - fatal traces . There were also traces of strychnine - fatal traces . They killed him before he could talk . Jarod , how could you possibly know this ? I have a close contact on the inside . Remember , Miss Parker . - Missing pieces . - [ Phone Beeps ] Jarod , don 't hang up . Jarod . [ Sighs ] Damn it . Annoying , isn 't it , Miss Parker ? He has a habit of disappearing in the middle of a conversation . Jarod says that Dawson was murdered . - By whom ? - He didn 't say . Your boy 's really starting to piss me off . - Where are you going ? - L - I set up a meeting with Detective Miller . He 's gonna meet me at my house in 20 minutes . What makes you believe you can trust him ? [ Sighs ] Ronald Miller - 23 years on the force , six meritorious citations . He 's got four kids , and he 's still married to his high school sweetheart . From where I stand , he 's the only person in this entire situation ... who doesn 't have an agenda . [ Machine Grinding ] [ People Chattering ] [ Chatter On Police Radio ] - What happened ? - Some guy lost it on the curve . Pulled a kamikaze into the tree . They know who it is ? I didn 't get a name , but the tow truck driver said he was a cop . [ Gasps ] [ Jarod 's Voice ] Missing pieces , Miss Parker . Missing pieces . The true casualties of war are always the innocent . War . Is that what this is ? He had four children and a wife . I just ... can 't help but feel responsible . We 're all responsible . But not for this . This is the brake line from Miller 's car . It was cut deliberately . - Someone sabotaged it ? - Ron Miller was a good cop . He was just trying to find the truth behind Thomas 's murder . That 's why he and Dawson were silenced . So that - So that no tracks could lead back to the Centre . That is what they do . They kill anyone who 's remotely interested in the truth . Then they take away the people that we love the most . Why ? To control us , to use us to do their dirty work . For me , it was my parents and my brother . And you - your mother and now Thomas . You ever wonder how a man in prison ... got his hands on pharmaceutical-grade morphine ? I do . - How do I stop them ? - With the truth . Missing pieces . [ Cell Phone Beeping ] - [ Line Rings ] - Broots , I need you to do something for me . Luckily , the Blue Cove Police ... use the same monitoring equipment that we do . I was able to hack into the tape archives ... and copy the video footage of the prisoner-surveillance area . Skip the tram ride . Did Wade Dawson have contact with anyone ... during the time he was locked up ? Just one person . [ No Audible Dialogue ] - I can 't see his face . - Other camera angles ? None . But he turns slightly towards the lens as he gets up to leave . [ Miss Parker ] That has to be the poisoned drugs . Dawson must have used chewing gum or glue ... to make it stick to the bottom of his boot . - What about the mystery man ? - Oh , he 's comin ' up . Wait . Go back . Go back . Freeze there . [ Distorted ] There 's been a murder up on Briar Road . - The trashman . - Who ? That 's the same man that was outside my house . Run a check on him . I wanna know who that is and where I can find him . Missing pieces . Howdy , folks . How can we help you today ? We 're looking for someone . We think he may be working here . [ Miss Parker ] Look familiar ? Why y 'all lookin ' for this fella ? Oh , we represent a trust account , and , uh ... we have reasons to believe the man in the picture is owed a large sum of money . - [ Laughing ] Unlucky Lester hit the jackpot ? - Quite possible . - Where can we find unlucky Lester ? - He 's right in the back . Mm . - [ People Laughing ] - Lester . - Lester . - Who wants to know ? We need to talk to you . I 'm kind of busy right now . I just - Uh ! Give me another reason to shoot you . - Wh-What do you want ? - Remember me ? [ Stammers ] No . No . Sydney , step back . I wouldn 't want you to get brain matter all over your new suit . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . I only did what the guy asked me to do . I thought it was a prank . Get up . Get up ! - Who told you to come to my house that morning ? - I don 't know . It was just a voice on the phone . He offered me a thousand dollars to be in the woods that morning . He said all I had to do was call the cops and take off . I swear . I swear . L - I thought it was a stunt . Does that include passing drugs to people while they 're in jail ? - I needed the money . - I 'll bet you did . - What about Miller ? - Who ? The cop whose car you sabotaged . - I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . - [ Chuckles ] You 're lyin ' , and you 're dyin ' . - Hold it . Hold it . - Trashman 's our only link to Thomas 's killer . Dead , he 'll be of no further help . [ Exhales ] Do you think you could recognize his voice if you heard it again ? Yeah . Uh , I guess . Uh , but , uh - That 'll-That 'll cost ya . - Go on . - Well , whoever this guy is ... he 's not real fond of leavin ' loose ends , if you know what I mean . - What do you want ? - Uh - Uh , four - five ... hundred thousand dollars . That 's the deal . You take it or ... shoot me right here . Either way , I 'm finished . [ Miss Parker ] Dawson was framed . They planted my gun on him and pumped him so full of pure morphine that even he ... wasn 't sure if he pulled the trigger or not . Daddy , don 't you see ? This man at the garage is the only person ... who can identify Thomas 's killer . Half a million dollars is a lot of money . I 'd pay 10 times that if I thought it 'd ease your pain . If the Centre is involved , we have to keep it internal . - No outside agencies . Clear ? - Crystal . You go find him , bring him back . It 's time we ended this mess once and for all . [ Engine Idling Quietly ] - [ Shakes Doorknob ] - Door 's locked . Hello ? Stay behind me . Lester . Broots , give me the flashlight . [ Broots ] What 's that noise ? [ Coughs ] The car 's running . Oh , my God . Broots , kill the engine ! The door 's locked . The window 's closed . [ Miss Parker ] Out of the way . Hold this . Back off . Give me some light . - [ Sydney ] He 's gone . - Let 's get out of here . [ Gasps ] Daddy . What are you doing here ? It was my idea . When I heard what you were up to ... we were concerned for your safety , so we followed you . It 's a dangerous world , little lady . - Can 't be too careful . - She 's right . These people are nothin ' but scum . They 'd kill you soon as look at you . Daddy , this man was the last link in proving who killed Thomas . Well , this breaks the chain for good . Get a Cleaner team in here . I don 't want any trace of Centre involvement . Yes , sir . - [ Lyle On Cell Phone , Indistinct ] - That 's it ? That 's all you 're gonna do ? Ah . I know how hard it is to lose somebody you love . Stop searching for fixes , answers that may not exist . The only way to survive is to get on with the business of living . Sorry , angel . Ah , it 's a hell of a thing . [ Woman Vocalizing , Ethereal ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - [ Softly ] What ? - You spend way too much time in cemeteries , Miss Parker . They killed them all , and for what ? Power ? Control ? - What will you do now ? - [ Sighs ] I 'm going to grieve . I 'm gonna stand here and remember all the good things I had . And then ? I 'm gonna wait until they think it 's all ... forgotten ... find out who did this and make them pay . Look under the tree next to you . I left you a little present . Don 't stop searching for those missing pieces , Miss Parker . If you do , you 'll never find what you 're looking for . - [ Beeps ] - [ Beeps ] [ Woman Singing Ballad ] Tell me about love , Mama . What do you want to know ? Will I ever find someone to love , like you found Daddy ? I think you will . [ Continues ] [ Ends ] [ Thomas 's Voice ] I love you , Parker .

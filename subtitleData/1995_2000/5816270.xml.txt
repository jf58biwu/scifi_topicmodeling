 Okay , I 've got the afternoon planned . What do you say ? Not now . David Hasselhoff 's in a real bind . He got zinc oxide in his eyes . He can 't rescue the french student caught in the riptide . - You can 't even hear it . - Doesn 't matter . The show 's that good . I 'd give anything to be one of those lifeguards . Judging wet t-shirt contests , full-body rubdowns - giving supermodel mouth-to mouth ... - Let 's do it . - No , thanks , Lis . - Why not ? Being a baywatch lifeguard is the super bowl of wishes . I couldn 't bear to see you screw this one up . We prepare to stick with the fantasy . All the magic in the world couldn 't make life as good as that . Oh . So you don 't think I could pull this one off . No , no , no . Yes . You couldn 't handle the beach fantasy I could give you . I 'd surround you with so many hard , tanned , nubile bodies your eyes would pop out of you skills . That 's the thing we 're worried about . Trust me . Here you go- - lifeguards on the ultimate Baywatch beach . - Faster than you can say " uber thong . " - Checklist ? - We 're still guys . Good . - Eyes still in sockets . - Fingers and toes ? - Ten and ten . All accounted for . Relax . You 'll love this so much , your heads will explode . Bye . What are you two doing standing around ? Uh-oh . Here we go . This is where the wish goes tragically wrong . Gary , the wet t-shirt contest on the east beach needs a judge . Get on it now . Wyatt , the hawaiian tropic bikini team needs hands-on CPR training . So move it . - I knew Lisa would come through . - Don 't forget your chapstick . WYATT : How did that wet t-shirt contest go ? The competition was fierce . But you know , in a contest like this there are no losers . Just women with smaller breasts . So , how did your CPR training go ? Get enough mouth-to-mouth ? Empty . - ' Nuff said . - Oh , I 'm in heaven ! - Oh , we owe you big time , Lis . - The fun is just beginning . - I 'm having a baby . - It 's okay , ma 'am . - I 'm a lifeguard . - Thank God . This could be pretty hard to watch , folks . You may want to look away . Okay , now push ! [ woman gasping ] [ screams ] [ slapping bottom ] [ baby crying ] You were wonderful . I 'd like to name him after you . - What 's your name ? - " Wyatt . " Oh . What 's your middle name ? - " Lester . " - What 's your favorite color ? - Burnt umber . - Do you like red ? - Sure . - We 'll call him " Red " after you . Oh , my gosh ! GARY : Wy , a bather seems to be in Peril and she 's beautiful . Long legs ... great tan ... and a birthmark just below her strap line . - I 'm going in . - A lifeguard 's duty is never done . I was just guarding some lives , and I couldn 't help noticing you doodle . - Crabs , sea-horses , shrimp- - - I love the creatures of the sea . Me too . A little ketchup , dab of tartar , a little lemon . It 's horrible . I could never eat the children of mother ocean . Oh . I didn 't mean seafood from the ocean . I ... I ... Did I mention I was a lifeguard ? Look , as you already know in order for me to save you - you have to be drowning . - I can arrange that . You could administer a little CPR . A little breathing ' . - A little squeezing ' . - Sorry . CPR 's only for when your heart stops . Although that could be arranged . [ laughs ] [ gasping ] Whoa ! Guys , we 're no match for this one . - She 's Big Kahuna material . - " Big Kahuna " ? Big Kahuna knows all . He rides different wavelength seeing things us normal dudes only dream about and he does his own taxes . - You 're the Big Kahuna ? - They still calling me that ? Of course they are . You just asked me , didn 't you ? " Big Kahuna . " Do I look the least bit samoan to you ? I 'm from Lubblock , Texas . That 's not to say you couldn 't have the souls of a samoan . Ah , crunchy texan on the outside chewy samoan on the inside . Two great tastes that taste great together . I make you nervous , don 't I ? I 've been told I have that effect on women . - Really ? - No . But I always thought it would be neat if I did . Ah , surf seems to be- - as the wave aficionados put it- - up . Till we meet again , surfer girl . - Kahuna ? - Huh ? I think you 're kind of cute . Now look who 's nervous . " Cute " ? Where did that come from ? Ding . Round two . Armed with the confidence of the beach vet he is golden boy Wallace is sure of a win . Give it up , Gary . She shot you down . She 'll come around . I 'm buff , I 'm tanned , I 'm irresistible . You 're skinny , you 're pale , you 're confused . Oh , good . It 's you . I know what you 're thinking : the insensitive , sushi-loving jerk is back . But that was the old me . The new me is fish-free . I think you 're cute and all but I 'm not interested . My passion is the sea the tranquility of the deep its eternal , silent beauty the harmony the oneness of all its many creatures . - Let 's go back to the " I 'm cute " part . - Go away . What are you doing ? This is insane . He 's not even your type . Do you mind if I join you ? It 's just that you 're sitting alone and you look thirsty - and I found these drinks . - Lucky you . - Can I have one ? - That was the idea . What are these little umbrellas for ? To guarantee moderation ? You drink too fast , you could lose an eye . They 're like the speed bumps of fruity drinks . Goodness . I 've been garnished . Thanks . Takes a special kind of woman to wear fruit well . I 'm sorry I don 't have one for the other ear . That 's okay . I 'll switch off . You know , I 've never met anyone like you . Considered myself a rugged individualist . - You are different . - You 're pretty different yourself . You have a certain ... aroma about you . - What ? - Whenever you 're around I detect a hint of ... - electricity in the air . - I smell like electricity ? Like a transformer from a miniature train set . - Just part of your magic , I suppose . - My magic ? ... and then he said I was electric and magical and special . News flash , Lis- - any guy who wants to date a girl will tell her that . Duh . I wasn 't created yesterday . It wasn 't a come-on line . It was deeper than that . it 's as if Kahuna ... knows about me . Knows who I am . That 's impossible . I think he 's just trying to be smooth . If he was , don 't you think he 'd get contact lenses - and a decent haircut first ? - So , what 's the attraction ? I have no idea . [ screaming ] Coming through ! Oh , my God ! It 's Petra ! She 's caught in a riptide ! - Gary ? - I can 't swim . - Say what ? ! - I sink like a rock . - Then I 'll go in . - No , wait . I have to do this myself . Lis , make me a great swimmer . Okay . Go save her . It was ... incredible . The riptide was pulling me down and this beautiful , wondrous creature saved my life . " Wondrous creature " ? You didn 't ? WYATT : I can 't believe you did this . What is he ? - Isn 't it obvious ? - He 's a merman . He looks like a sea monkey on steroids . You think he actually likes it in there ? - Mr. Bitchy-fins isn 't talking to me . - Hang on . I know how to get his attention . Hey , what do you know ? They really do hate that . Nice . Now he 's never going to talk to me . Oh , yes , he will . Hey , Wy . I guess it 's a new record . Two full days in a row before Lisa mutated one of us . The spell will wear off soon , another 20 hours max - and you 'll be walking again . - I can live with that , but in the meantime how 's about zapping up a hundred pounds of chum ? I 'm starved . You take care of it . I 've got a date . - Nice shot . - Thanks . - A great teacher . - A teacher is defined by his student . So that would make me the most fascinating captivating , hypnotic teacher in the world with really great hair and beautiful , pouty lips . I shouldn 't I ? I don 't know . I liked where you were going . - Oh ... good . - Very good . - Wow . - Nice . You are magic . Who-can-turn-the-world - on-with-her-smile kind of magic ? No . I meant like a reality - bending , computer-generated blue-bolts-of-energy-out - your-fingertips kind og magic . I got to go . [ sighs ] Good going , Kahuna . Always flooding the proverbial engine . Uh ... what exactly is that you 're sketching ? It 's the wondrous creature from the deep who saved my life . Although I only saw him for a second he was the most beautiful thing I ever laid eyes on . Uh ... could I borrow one of these drawings ? I don 't believe it . She does like me . I knew I 'd get through to her eventually . Gary , did you get the brain of a goldfish too ? She 's hot for Aquaman , m the mysterious creature - that saved her life , not you . - But I am that guy . Until your feet grow back . Then you 'll be that guy she 's not so crazy about again . Maybe not . You want to breathe through your neck forever ? If it gets me dates , I 'll breathe through your neck . If I were you , I wouldn 't toss out my shoes just yet . I got to get back . Make yourself useful . Suck some algae off the side of the tank . I couldn 't get it all . Yeah , information ? I 'd like the number for a Petra Perth . Oh ! Oh , my God . You 're just as beautiful as I remembered . You look pretty hot yourself when you 're not hacking up help . - Thanks for saving my life . - I 'm a Merman- it comes with the gig . - Do you ... mind if I feed you ? Be my guest . Put you in this tank confined , when the boundless sea is your real home . It 's okay , I guess ... Once you get past the stink but that I 've found you . - My merman days are over . - What do you mean ? You know the legend . When a sea stud like me falls in love with a hot-looking air breather , he becomes human . I 'm trying to say I 'm trading in my tail for a pair of boots . - Isn 't that great ? - No ! That 's a terrible idea . - Is it ? - Don 't you see ? There 's five billion humans , but only one of you . You 're unique , special . An extraordinary creature like you belongs in the sea . - But ... - Don 't speak . - Careful , careful . - Yo ! Ease off , Jacques . It 's a little nippy out here . You want to change my water , fine . - Throw me in a hot tub . - We 're changing your water from this chlorine soup to the natural PH balance of your ocean home . My ocean home that 's far for land full of sharks - and very , very deep ? - Oh , hurry it up , guys . He 's losing scales . Look , Petra , when I left the ocean home it was not on the best of terms . There was a lot of bad blood between me and the tiger sharks- - chow boundaries , who gets to gorge on what . - Talk about a feeding frenzy ... - Keep him wet ! - We 're almost there . - Was that a McDonald 's ? Anybody hungry ? Why don 't we all stop ? Get a bite to eat . Relax . Uh ... hell . Lisa ! I don 't get it . Gary looks like a scalded chimp with flippers and he still got a girl out of the deal . Wyatt ? Uh-oh . Petra 's been here . The spell 's wearing off . He 's changing back . - If she dumps him in the ocean ... - He 'll go down like a sack full of kittens ! Look , Petra , if you like me as a fish you 'll love me as a human . - I 'm looking forward to it myself . - My sweet , Noble Merman . Willing to give up your watery birthright for me . No ! I 've got a vested interest in this . Paddle away , you miracle of evolution . Go ! Swim ! Join your pod ! - Where is he ? - I set him free . Back where he belongs- - on the bottom of the ocean . - Oh , God . Gary ! - Stand back , Wyatt . I 'll empty the whole ocean if I have to ... or turn myself into a dolphin or zap up a really big straw ... Look ! Looks like I 'll live . Great . You didn 't see a merman out there , did you ? - You did it ! - I had nothing to do with this . Wait a sec . If you didn 't , then who ? " I wasn 't sure what your favorite flowers were so I went with plastic . " They 're from the Kahuna . Plastic . How did he know ? Okay , let 's track this . You gave me fins , you gave me gills and I 'll be burping chum for days . Once again , you 've made the fantasy a reality . Speak for yourself . I got a serious tan , three dates and a godson named Red . - And I found someone like me . - You 're convinced he 's a genie ? All I know is he acted as though he could read my mind and he saved Gary 's life . He may have powers we can 't begin to imagine . Is it my break ? Captioned by Grant Brown

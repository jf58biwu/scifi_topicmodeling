Hey ! [ Click of release ] [ Thumps of movement ] [ Click of release ] [ Grunt of exertion ] [ Grunt of landing ] [ Scream ] [ Wailing ] I 'm sorry . [ Gasps of terror ] I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . I 'm not going to hurt you . What do you want ? I thought you were ... What ? I don 't know . [ Rumble ] Woman : [ Shouting ] Help ! Help ! Woman : Help ! [ Click of release ] Help ! Stop ! What ? What ... ? It 's okay . Come here . [ Grunt of falling ] It 's okay . Calm down . Everything 's gonna be fine . What was in there ? Just give me a minute to figure things out . Why were you afraid of that room ? Give me a minute , I said . [ Opening of portal ] [ Laboured breathing ] How many people are in this thing ? Listen , we can 't go climbing around in here . Why not ? [ Closing of portal ] There 's traps . What do you mean , traps ? Man : Booby-traps . I looked in the room down there and something almost cut my head off . Girl : [ Gasping ] Woman : Holy cats ! Holy , holy cats ! [ Music ] Are you all right ? Mister ? Worth ! [ Gasping ] Don 't worry . I hit my head . Let me take a look at that . It 's okay . I 'm a doctor . Woman : It doesn 't look bad . What the hell are you doing ? [ Grunts of effort ] [ Click of release ] [ Grunts of effort ] Hey , old man , Did you hear what I said ? [ Whine of movement ] [ Whine of movement ] [ Closing of portal ] Motion detectors integrated into the walls . Tough to spot . Girl : Oh , god ! Oh , god . Oh , god . Wait a second . Let 's all just relax for a minute . Does anybody remember how they got here ? [ Shaky breaths ] Perogies ! I was eating dinner . Perogies ; cheese and potato . I ran out of sour cream , And then I went to the fridge , and then ... I don 't know . You ? Leaven ? I ... I just went to bed and ... What about you ? I just woke up here . Middle of the night . It 's like Chile . They always come in the middle of the night . Who ? Woman : Only the government could build something this ugly . Quentin : Oh , it ain 't government . Woman : Then what is it ? I don 't know . Aliens . [ Rumble ] Please . We 're spooked enough as it is . Let 's ... [ Snort ] let 's rule out aliens for now , and concentrate on what we know . My mom 's gonna freak . Rennes ? I just won 't be there . They 'll freak . What do you think , Rennes ? Well , it won 't solve jack shit sitting still . I 'm moving in a straight line till I get to the end . All right . I tend to agree . Leaven : Shouldn 't we wait here ? For what ? To see if anybody comes . No one 's gonna come . Look , there 's away in here . So there 's gotta be away out . We can avoid the traps using the boot . Quentin : Holloway , is it ? What do you think ? Look for an exit ? Okay . What about you ? It can 't be that simple . Rennes : It won 't be that simple . Look around . Take a good , long look-see . 'cause I got a feeling it 's looking at us . [ Rumble ] I just wanna wake up . [ Whimpering ] Leaven . [ Gulp ] We can do this . Quentin : We just have to stay calm , and work together as a team . [ Grunt ] There 's gonna be a lot of people looking for us on the outside . I 'm a cop . All right ? You 're a cop ? Yeah . Quentin : I 'm going to get you out of here . I promise . You gotta be with me on this one . Okay . Okay ? [ Opening of portal ] Boot it . Clean . [ Rumble ] Holloway : That one sounded closer . It 's mechanical . Seems to come at regular intervals . Quentin : Maybe it 's their ventilation system . Rennes : No vents . Holloway : no kidding . I 'm boiling . Quentin : What is it ? Serial numbers ? Holloway : Room numbers . They 're different in each room . Worth : Oh , great . Well , it 's only , uh , 566 million , 400,000 odd rooms In this thing . Well , there better not be . We have about three days without food and water before we 're too weak to move . Well , they have to feed us , don 't they ? Holloway ? Oh , we have heat , stress , physical exertion , i.e. dehydration . Headaches , dizziness , confused mental processes . The body eventually begins to break down its own tissue . Suck on it . Keeps the saliva flowing . [ Sniffing ] What ? The air seems dry in there . Holloway : Trapped ? Molecular-chemical sensor . Why the hell didn 't the boot set it off ? Rennes : The boot 's not alive . It detects hydrogen sulphide excreted from the skin . How is it you know so much about sensors , Rennes ? [ Closing of portal ] [ Rumble ] Renne , not Rennes . It 's French . Fine , you 're French . I 'm asking how ... [ Click of release ] Renne ! Quentin : Sensor expert . About the right age . I don 't believe it . [ Chuckle ] This guy 's " The Wren " . The what ? He 's " The Wren " . The bird of Attica . Flew the coop out of six major prisons . Seven . Holloway : You 're kidding , right ? You can get us out ? Maybe . An escape artist . Yeah , harry fucking Houdini . The only reason I dragged you this far is ' cause I need your boots . If you don 't smarten up , I 'm gone like that . No more talking , no more guessing , don 't even think about nothing that 's not right in front of ya . That 's the real challenge . You gotta save yourselves from yourselves . [ Click of release ] Merde ! [ Mechanical whirring ] [ Screaming ] Get him out ! [ Howl of pain ] Women : [ Screaming ] [ Mixed yelling ] [ Wailing ] [ Gasping ] Oh , my god . [ Gagging ] Quentin : So , it was electro - chemical or whatever , right ? And he missed it . " The Wren " . That 's great . That 's fucking great . All right . It 's time to reassess this place . I 've been over it again and again . Why would they throw innocent people in here ? Are we being punished ? I have never done any - thing to deserve this . Forget about all that . You can 't see the big picture from in here , so don 't try . Keep your head down . Keep it simple . Just ... Just look at what 's in front of you . That 's what he said . Quentin : Start with us . We got an escape artist and a cop . There 's gotta be a reason for that . You 're a doctor , Holloway . That gives you a function , a reason , right ? No , it just makes me go , " why me , and not one of the other 10 million doctors out there ? " [ Sigh of frustration ] Leaven ? What are you ? Nothing . I just go to school . I hang out with my friends . What else ? There is nothing else . My parents are these people . I live with them . I 'm boring . I think we have to ask the big questions . What does it want ? What is it thinking ? One down , four to go . [ Rumble ] Why don 't you tell us what your purpose is , worth ? Often wondered that myself . [ Sigh ] I 'm just a guy . I work in an office building , doing office building stuff . I wasn 't exactly bursting with joie de vivre before I got here . Life just sucks in general . Oh , I can 't stand that attitude . Because he 's right ? What 's your purpose , Quentin ? Kids . Three of them . I haven 't made my peace yet . But I 'm getting outta here no matter what . That 's where my strength comes from . You people find yours wherever you got it . For Christ 's sake , worth , what do you live for ? Don 't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something ? Nope . But I 've got a pretty fine collection of pornography . Holloway : How nice ! Nice ! I haven 't got anybody either , but I 'm not giving up . I am pissed off . They came into our homes . They stripped us bare . They took my rings . They took ... oh , my amethyst . [ Rumble ] I want to know who 's responsible . Quentin : Leaven . Your glasses . You don 't need them . They 're for reading . Well , they took off her jewellery , but they must have ... Put these on you . If nothing 's random , why are they here ? Quentin : Leaven , what do you do in school ? Math ! What can they mean ? Sssh ! 149 . [ Click of release ] Leaven : Prime numbers . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . Quentin : See what ? It seems like if any of these numbers are prime , then the room is trapped . Okay , um , 645 . [ Whispering ] 645 . That 's not prime . 372 . No . 649 . Right . 11 times 59 . It 's not prime either . So that room is safe . Wait , wait , wait . How can you make that assumption based on one prime number trap ? I 'm not . The incinerator thing was prime . 83 . The molecular-chemical thingy had 137 . The acid room had 149 . You remember all that in your head ? I have a facility for it . Quentin : Leaven . You beautiful brain . Boot it . [ Grunt of effort ] Okay , out of the way . Leaven : Brains before beauty . Safe ! [ Gasp of relief ] Safe ! [ Laugh of triumph ] Prime numbers ! Prime numbers ! Prime numbers . Prime numbers . Prime numbers ... [ Music ] Leaven : How long have we been in here ? Quentin : Nine or ten hours . Leaven : How do you know ? Quentin : 5 : 00 o 'clock shadow . Last thing I remember was shaving . Leaven : I guess I missed breakfast . Or lunch . Or whatever . Quentin : Well , don 't worry . I 'll have you home in time for dinner . Leaven : If we get out , I 'll make you dinner . Quentin : You 've got a date . [ Music ] [ Click of release ] Doing good . [ Rumble ] I need to smoke . I 'd smoke a butt off the sidewalk . Holloway , just reel yourself in a bit . Come on . We 're moving along . Things are looking up . Okay , okay , you 're right . I quit smoking years ago . [ Harsh breath ] I just need to be occupied . Quentin : Talk then . Have a conversation . What kind of doctor are you anyway ? Uh , oh you know , I 'm the free kind . Okay , chit-chat . chit-chat . Um ... Um , come on , help me . Uh , tell me about your rug-rats . Okay . We have three boys . Nine , seven and five . Oh , good god ! The poor woman . There 's no way I 'd survive that . Yeah . She didn 't either . No , she 's not dead . She ... We 're just separated . Uh , I 'm sorry . I can 't just shoot the breeze . These numbers aren 't prime . Okay . Clear . Excuse me . Sorry . You , uh , could try and help me out here , buddy . No I couldn 't . [ Rumble ] This one 's trapped too . We have to backtrack ? Not yet . Holloway : Oh , no . Read them to me . Holloway : What are you ? His coat rack ? Leaven : Look , please . [ Grunts of effort ] [ Rattling of portal ] It 's stuck . [ Releasing of portal ] Man : [ Wailing ] Leaven : Look out ! [ Grunts of landing ] [ Closing of portal ] This room is green . [ Bumping of head ] Holloway . Hi , there . This room is green . Holloway : Yes , it is . I wanna go back to the blue room . What is it ? Shock or what ? I think he 's mentally handicapped . I like the blue room . Jesus Christ ! He almost broke my neck . Hey , there , are you all alone ? Do you want to hold my hand , honey ? Butter first , then honey , Kazan . Butter first , then honey ... How 'd he survive ? Kazan : I want to go back to the blue room . There 's lots of blue rooms . We 'll find you another one real soon . Leaven : This is just way too bizarre . Well you just worry about your numbers then . Go on . I 'll look after him . Safe , obviously , since he almost fell on my head . Holloway : Should we go for a walk ? Kazan ? You want to go for a walk ? [ Whimpering ] Holloway : Um , Quentin ? Kazan : [ Wailing ] Let 's not make him do the climbing thing right away . Holloway ! Holloway . Holloway : Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico ? Quentin : What are you talking about , Holloway ? Holloway : I 'm talking about where do you hide something this big ? At least he 's good for something . Hey , I 'm sorry to shake your foundations , Quentin , but you have no idea where your tax dollars go . Free clinic doctors . Holloway : Only the military - industrial complex could afford to build something this size . Holloway ? What is the military industrial complex ? Have you ever been there ? I 'm telling you , it 's not that complex . How would you know from where you are ? Who do you think the establishment is ? [ Snort ] it 's just guys like me . Their desks are bigger but their jobs aren 't . They don 't conspire . They buy boats . Quentin : No , this place is ... Remember Scaramanga ? The bad guy in " the man with the golden gun " . Yeah ? It 's some rich psycho 's entertainment . [ Snort of laughter ] Is that what you think ? Clear ! [ Jeering laughter ] Okay . You 're a cop . Single bullet theory . Right on ! [ Choking gasps ] [ Wailing ] Gas ! Holloway ! Get back here . [ Coughing / gagging ] [ Gulp ] Holloway : It 's okay . I just swallowed my button . [ Sighs of relief ] Kazan : [ Wailing ] Leaven : I hate this ! Your boy 's having a conniption fit in there . It 's like cramming without coffee . She needs a break . she can do it . Kazan : [ Moaning ] They all look prime to me . That your two-bits worth , worth ? For what it 's worth . [ Whimpering ] Well ? Well , he 's right . They 're not prime . Leaven : Stop ! In front of you . [ Howl of pain ] What is it ? [ Wailing ] Ow ! Ow ! [ Gasp of pain ] Kazan : [ Wailing ] Shut up ! I don 't know what happened . It wasn 't prime . Quentin , hold still . Kazan : [ Wailing ] Somebody stop that racket . Worth ! Leave the boots . [ Opening of portal ] Kazan : [ Howling ] And shut the fucking door . I had a feeling about that fucking guy . He knew about that trap . But these numbers aren 't prime . Then your number system failed . But he knew . Knew what ? How would he know ? You 're the paranoid one . Think about it . His only function so far has been to kick us when we 're down . So he has a bad attitude . Are you saying that makes him a spy ? Trust me on this . It 's my job to read people like an x-ray . [ Opening of portal ] [ Whimpering ] he doesn 't Like red rooms . [ Closing of portal ] [ Moaning ] [ Sigh ] So what happened ? You saw what happened . Quentin . I guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought . Maybe they mean nothing at all . Leaven : No , it means they 're more involved . They 've worked for us up till now , haven 't they ? I just need some more time with them . Well , we need to rest anyway . Well , that 's handy , 'cause there 's not a fuck of a lot else we can do . Are they telling you anything ? They 're not tarot cards . [ Sigh ] do you have any idea how many variables I have to consider before I can decipher numbers this size ? They don 't reveal themselves right away . They 're like people . Leaven : Oh , gross ! [ Moaning ] Oh , not here , honey . Over in the corner . [ Splatter of urinating ] Well , he 's just peeing . Jesus Christ ! That 's excellent . Now it totally reeks in here . You find this all pretty funny , don 't you ? What 's your fucking problem , worth ? Even Holloway 's holding up better than you . Get over there and help her with him . That 's your job : Babysitter . Ja 'wohl , kommandant . Somebody has to take responsibility around here . And that somebody has to be you . Not all of us have the luxury of playing nihilist . Not all of us are conceited enough to play hero . His is a will to live . Everybody 's got it , worth , even you . Especially you , hiding behind that cynical front . A will to live . That 's the warm , cosy feeling deep inside ? Thanks , Quentin , I 'm a new man . Oh ! Poor worth ! Nobody loves me . If that 's the chip on your shoulder , why didn 't you just lie down and die ? [ Click of release ] Do it . Show us you have some backbone , and jump in the sushi machine . Be a man . Thought so . Fuck you , Quentin . I don 't wanna die . I 'm just being realistic . You think they 'd go to all this trouble if we could just walk out ? They would have left us clues and let us beat it so far , if there wasn 't a way out ? You think we matter ? We don 't . Ah , put us out of your misery , so we can get out of here . - you 're not getting out of here . - yes , we are . No , you 're not . Yes , we are . There is no way out of here . Quentin : Gotcha . [ Rumble ] How ... do you know that ? Answer the question , worth . Oh , god ! Who are you ? I 'm the poisoner . I designed the outer shell . What ? The shell of the sarcophagus . You built this thing ? Not this part , the exterior . I ... I don 't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here . I was contracted to draw up plans for a hollow shell . A cube . Leaven : a cube ? Why didn 't you tell us ? For god 's sakes , worth , you knew what it was . No . Worth . You 're lying . It 's not a first . Holloway : Who 's behind it ? I dunno . Who hired you ? I didn 't ask . [ Snort ] I never even Left my office . I talked to them on the phone ; other guys like me , specialists working on ... on small details . Nobody knew what it was . Nobody cared . Bull shit ! You knew from square one . Look at him . He 's up to his eyeballs in this thing . No , Quentin . That 's how they stay hidden . You keep everyone separated , so the left hand doesn 't know what the right hand is doing . The brain never comes out in the open . Whose brain ? It 's all the same machine , right ? The pentagon , multi - national corporations , the police ! If you do one little job , you build a widget in Saskatoon , and the next thing you know , it 's two miles under the desert , the essential component of a death machine . I was right . All along , my whole life , I knew it . I told you , Quentin . Nobody 's ever going to call me paranoid again . We 've got to get out of here and blow the lid off this thing . [ Laboured breathing ] Holloway , you don 't get it . Then help me please . I need to know . This may be hard for you to understand , but there is no conspiracy . Nobody is in charge . It ... it 's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan . Can you grasp that ? Big brother is not watching you . What kind of fucking explanation is that ? It 's the best you 're gonna get . I looked , and the only conclusion I could come to is that there is nobody up there . Somebody had to say , " yes " , to this thing . - What thing ? - Only we know what it is . We have no idea what it is . We know more than anybody else . I mean , somebody might have known sometime before they got- - they got fired or voted out or sold it . But if this place ever had a purpose , then it got miscommunicated or ... or ... or lost in the shuffle . I mean , this is an accident ; a ... a forgotten perpetual public works project . Do you think anybody wants to ask questions ? All they want is a ... is a clear conscience and a fat pay check . I mean , I leaned on my shovel for months on this one . This was a great job . Why put people in it ? Because it 's here . You have to use it , or you admit it 's pointless . But it ... it is pointless . [ Snort ] Quentin , that 's my point . What have we come to ? It 's so much worse than I thought . Not really . Just more pathetic . You make me sick , worth . I make me sick too . We 're both part of the system . I drew a box . You walk a beat . It 's like you said , Quentin . Just keep your head down , keep it simple , just look at what 's in front of you . Nobody wants to see the big picture . Life 's too complicated . I mean , let 's face it , the reason we 're here is that it 's outta control . This is how we ruin the world ? Leaven : Well , duh ! Have you been on glue all your lives ? I felt guilty for ruining the world since I was like seven . God ! If you need someone to blame , throw a rock . [ Heavy sigh ] Well , I feel better . That 's why you stayed with us . To confess . [ Rumble ] Still looking for someone to bust , Quentin ? [ Music ] [ Grunts of struggle ] [ Groans ] Leaven : Quentin , stop it ! Stop it ! We need him . What for ? Have you gone absolutely mad ? He 's the only one who knows anything about the place . [ Laboured breathing ] [ Grunt ] Worth . H-hi . So there 's this outer shell ? Yeah . And it 's a cube , right ? Like this ? I assume so . Are there any doors ? There 's one door . Where ? Where the door guy put it . Worth : Six guesses and it 's sealed from the outside . And what are the dimensions of the outer shell ? [ Shuddering ] 434 feet square . May I ? Come on , honey , Slide over . [ Sigh ] 14 by 14 by 14 . The inner cube can 't be flush to the shell wall . I know that . There 's a space . One cube ? I don 't know . It makes sense . Okay , well ... the biggest that the cube can be then is 26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so ... 17,576 rooms . 17,576 rooms ? [ Rumble ] Oh , god . That makes me queasy . Descartes . Leaven , you are a genius . What ? What ? Leaven : Cartesian coordinates . Of course . Coded Cartesian coordinates . They 're used in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph . In English ? Slower . I 'm sure these numbers are markers . A grid reference like ... latitude and longitude on a map . The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube . Well , where are we ? It works ! Okay , um , All we have to do is add the numbers together . X-coordinate is 19 , Y is ... 26 rooms . So that places us ... seven rooms from the edge . All right . Let 's go . Just out of curiosity , I mean , don 't hit me again or anything , But what are you going to do when you get there ? Maybe we can get the door open . Oh . What we need to do is figure out how to get around the traps . I 'm dealing with that , Holloway . I 'm looking for practical solutions here . Well , you haven 't found any yet . We 'll cut the risk , with the numbers and the boot . Worth will go in first . Holloway : No , he won 't , Quentin . We take turns . Relax . Quentin : Room for two in there ? [ Grunts of effort ] What 's the matter ? These coordinates ; 14 , 27 , 14 . What about ' em ? Well , they don 't make sense . Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across , There can 't be a coordinate larger than 26 . If this were right , then we would be outside of the cube . No , not outside of the cube . Oh . Guess that means we 're not having dinner . Kazan : Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap ! [ Rush of movement ] Trap ! [ Rush of movement ] Sound activated . Boo ! [ Rush of movement ] [ Closing of portal ] Lovely . How come the sound of the door opening didn 't set it off ? Must be rigged to ignore it . Holloway : so that 's it ? The edge is surrounded by traps . Well , I guess we have to backtrack , And try somewhere else . Quentin : Who knows how many detours we 'll have to take . I say we cross the bitch . Right ! ? How many boots do we have left , Holloway ? Quentin : Get it off him . We know how it works . We just have to be quiet . That 's pretty fucking quiet . Quentin : I 'm glad you 're on his side , worth , 'cause you 're up . Kazan : [ Squawk ] And he 's not coming . Of course he is . No way ! You 're not leaving him behind . He 's unpredictable . When we get to the edge we can come back for him , but he 'll get some - body killed here . Am I right ? Holloway : Shame on you . Will you look at yourselves ? What have you turned into ? They may have taken our lives away , but we 're still human beings . That 's all we 've got left . We 'll come back for him . That 's a lie and you know it . [ Rumble ] [ Humming ] He 'll be quiet . [ Opening of portal ] [ Rumble ] [ Click of release ] Both : [ Mouthing silently ] [ Mouthing silently ] [ Click of release ] [ Mouthing inaudibly ] [ Clicking of handle ] [ Click of release ] Ha ! [ Rush of movement ] Quentin : [ Yelling ] Leaven : [ Screaming ] You fucking fuck ! All right . That 's enough ! He 's a trap ! Let him go right now . The law of the jungle , Holloway , he 's endangering the pack . Let him go , you Nazi ! What did you call me ? Quentin , you let that innocent boy go . You listen to me , woman . Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart . The only reason you even exist is because I keep you . [ Whispering ] I know your type . No kids . No man to fuck you . So you go around outraged , sticking your nose up other people 's assholes , sniffing their business . Quentin : You missed your boat , Holloway . You 're all dried up inside there , aren 't you ? That 's your fucking problem . How dare you say that to her ? You don 't know her , Quentin . None of us know each other here . Oh ... I do . No , you don 't ! No wonder your wife left you . All that bottled up anger . And a thing for young girls . Holloway : [ Yelp of pain ] Kazan : [ Moaning ] [ Snort ] [ Moaning ] God help you , Quentin . Huh ! Did you smack your kids around too ? Is anybody besides me interested in what 's on the other side of that door ? Open it . Door number six , not number one , Door number two ? Open the fucking thing . [ Whispering ] sunshine . [ Click of release ] [ Opening of portal ] [ Whistling of wind ] Night time . Worth : My old friend the shell . It 's there . [ Calling ] morning . [ Echoes ] morning . Morning . Morning . Morning ... Quentin : Hang on to me . Can 't see shit . Nothing to hang on to . We gotta try something . We gotta see if the door 's over there . Someone has to swing over there and take a look . Worth : Swing ? Quentin : We make a rope ... Out of clothes . Take ' em off . I 'll tie it around myself . Oh , yeah , you 're gonna go . You weigh like 500 pounds . It 'll snap in two seconds . I 'm the lightest . Forget it . I 'll go . I 'm going , Holloway . She 's right , Quentin , you 're too heavy . I 'm the lightest after Leaven . Anyways , it 's my turn . How long did you know people were being put in here ? A couple of months . That 's not long , if you consider your whole life . [ Snort ] I am . You opened my eyes , worth . That 's something . David . Helen . You 're such a Helen . [ Sigh of determination ] [ Gasp of fear ] That 's as far as you go . Holloway : there 's nothing down here . Hold tight . I 'll try swinging over there . [ Grunt of effort ] [ Gasps ] Brace yourselves . I 'm going to try again . [ Grunt of effort ] [ Grunts ] [ Gasp ] okay . One more time . Worth : Hurry ! You 're getting heavy . [ Grunt of effort ] Leaven : [ Gasp ] [ Rumble ] What the hell 's going on ? Quentin : Get up here now . [ Grunts of effort ] [ Music ] [ Laugh of relief ] Worth : Quentin ! Leaven : Have you got her ? Worth : What 's going on ? Leaven : Quentin ? Is she okay ? [ Screaming ] She , uh ... Slipped . Kazan : Holloway ? [ Sobbing ] Kazan : [ Moaning ] Worth : Hush . Come on , Kazan . [ Louder moaning ] Kazan , will you please stop doing that ? Leaven . You gotta be strong , sweetheart . Don 't even talk to me . We gotta get down to the bottom . It 'll be easier to get on to the shell from there . It 's a long fucking way with only one boot , but we gotta do it before we get too weak . You gotta keep cracking the numbers , Leaven . I can 't think any more . Sure you can . It 's your gift . It 's not a gift . It 's just a brain . Let her sleep for awhile . We haven 't slept in fuck knows how long . All right . One hour . How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is ? An hour is as long as I say . [ Music ] [ Sleepily ] What are you doing ? We have to make it down to the bottom . It 'll be quiet there and you can concentrate . You just wanna leave them ? They 're traps , Leaven . We 're the key . I 'll get us down there . You 'll think us out . Believe in me . Try and see what I see ; how my mind works , the flash when I look into someone 's head , like a fucking x-ray . I looked through the walls . I dreamed him , at his desk , designing everything . Yeah . He can 't let you solve the puzzle , see ? 'cause there is a purpose . We are the purpose . The cube ... is us . [ Rumble ] Quentin ... we fit , like numbers . A man and a woman ; two halves of the equation . I 'll take you down ; the perfect key . I 'll slip you in the lock . [ Gasp of repulsion ] Leaven . It 's time to go down . [ Whimpering ] Worth : [ Growl of attack ] [ Closing of portal ] Getaway from her . Quentin : Leaven . They 're fucking spies : Him , the retard . Holloway had outside information about my family . But she slipped up , didn 't she ? She crossed the line . You dropped her . Just go , Quentin . Give us the boot , you pig . [ Howl of effort ] [ Groan ] [ Moaning ] You don 't want the boot . [ Groan ] [ Moans ] [ Gasping ] [ Click of release ] Quentin : You want to come with us , worth ? Down the hatch . Worth : [ Screaming ] [ Sobbing ] Worth : [ Laughing ] What the fuck 's with him ? Worth : [ Hysterical laughter ] [ Giggling madly ] [ Ominous ] How did he ... ? [ Gulping ] It 's ... it 's ... it 's " The Wren " . The old wrenster . [ Giggling ] How could ... ? We 're going in circles . [ Snort of laughter ] That can 't be . Where are we ? I don 't know . [ Opening of portal ] Where are we ? You figure it out . You haven 't done anything . All you did was freak out , you ... murderer ! [ Sobbing ] [ Giggling ] [ Rumble ] I guess you were right , worth . There is no way out of here . [ Snuffling ] [ Gasps of despair ] [ Sobbing ] Getaway from me . Quentin : [ Blubbering ] Wasn 't Rennes killed in that room ? [ Click of release ] How come there 's nothing out there ? It 's the edge . We weren 't at the edge before . Where 's the room that killed Rennes ? Fuck off ! Oh , that was good . What difference does it make ? We 're dead anyways . Hey ! Listen to what I 'm saying . There was a room there before . We haven 't been moving in circles . The rooms have . Of course . The rooms . That explains the thunder and the shaking . We 've been shifting the whole time . It 's ... it 's the only logical explanation . I 'm such an idiot . What are you on to , Leaven ? Give me a minute . Okay . The numbers are markers , points on a map , right ? Right . And how do you map a point that keeps moving ? Permutations . Permu-what ? Permutations . a list of all the coordinates that the room passes through . Like a map that tells you where the room starts , how many times it moves , and where it moves to . A number tells you all that ? I don 't know . See , I 've only been looking at one point on the map , which is probably the starting position . All I saw was what the cube looked like before it started to move . Okay , so it 's moving . How do we get out ? 27 ! I know where the exit is . Where ? Stay away from me . Back off , Quentin . I just want to know . Don 't you want to know ? You remember that room we passed through before ? The one with the coordinate larger than 26 ? What about it ? That coordinate placed the room outside the cube . [ Closing of portal ] A bridge ! Right . But only in its original position . What are you talking about ? Uh ... Look . The room starts off as a bridge . And then it ... it moves its way through the maze , which is where we ran into it . But at some point , it must return to its original position . So the bridge is only a bridge ... for a short period of time . This thing is like a giant combination lock . When the rooms are in their starting position , the lock is open . But when they move out of alignment , the lock closes . With a structure this size , it must take days for the rooms to complete a full cycle . So when does it open ? [ Rumble ] [ Music ] Don 't . To find the original coordinates , the numbers are added together to find the permutations , then subtracted from one another . That 's it . This room moves to zero , one , and negative one on the x-axis , two , five and negative seven on y , and one , negative one and zero on z . What does that mean ? You suck at math . Okay , I need the room numbers around us as a reference point . Worth : Six , six , six . Eight , nine , seven . Four , six , six . [ Opening of portal ] Five , six , seven . Eight , nine , eight . Okay ? Yes . And five , four , five . Did you get that ? Worth : Six , five , six . Seven , seven , eight . Four , six , two . That 's enough . X is 17 , y is 25 , and z is 14 . Which means this room makes two more moves before returning to its original position . Do we have time ? Maybe . Then let 's go . Can you work the traps for this system ? Fuck the traps . Let 's get to the bridge . Well you threw out our last boot , you fucking idiot . Technically I can identify the traps . Technically ? I thought they were identified by prime numbers , they 're not . They 're identified by numbers that are the power of a prime . Okay , so ? Can you calculate that ? The numbers are huge . But you can , right ? yes , you can . I 'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set . Maybe if I had a computer ... you don 't need a computer . Yes , I do . Figure it out . I can 't ! I 'm not dying in a fucking rat maze . Look ! Nobody in the whole world could do it mentally . Look at the numbers : 567 , 898 , 545 . There 's no way I can factor that . I can 't even start on 567 . It 's astronomical . Kazan : Two . Astronomical . What did you say ? Astronomical . Worth : Before that . Factors ? How many factors , Kazan ? Of 567 ? Two . What ? Are you fucking kidding ? Kazan , how many factors does 30 have ? Three . Leaven : How about seven ? One . Gum drop . I don 't have any gum drops . Kazan : Gum drop . Kazan ? I 'll give you a whole box of gum drops for each answer . Gum drops come in bags . Okay , you want ' em in bags , you got ' em in bags . Kazan : I don 't like the red ones . [ Click of release ] [ Opening of portal ] Eight , nine , eight . Two . Five , four , five . Two . He 's giving us the factors . Astronomical . You 're telling me telethon boy is a genius ? Leaven : By those numbers , the room should be safe . Only one way to find out . [ Gasping ] Don 't ! Worth : [ Groaning ] The room is safe . Kazan . My man . [ Moaning ] Quentin : What 's the number , buddy boy ? Hey ! Right here . Look here ! Make him do it . [ Grunt ] Kazan , we 're gonna do some numbers now , okay ? We like to do numbers , right ? Prime numbers . That 's right . Can you tell me the factor of 656 ? Two . 779 ? T-two . 462 ? Three . Clear . Move . Quentin : Come on . Come on , let 's go . You too , worth . Move your scrawny ass , worth . I 'm not through with you yet . Leaven , open that door . Get Einstein working on the numbers . [ Choking ] Oh , gee . Go ! Worth ... Worth : Hurry ! Leaven . 563 . [ Moaning ] Please , Kazan , 563 . You fucker , you 're dead ! Two . Clear . One . Trapped . Check the floor . Is he dead ? No . Not quite . [ Grunt of effort ] Quentin : Not even close ! [ Muffled ] when I get outta Here , I 'll ... Quentin : Where is he ? Come here . I said , " come here , right ... " [ Howling ] [ Moan ] Worth : Got ya ! That way . Two . Clear ! Four . Clear ! Worth : Oh ! Leven : [ Voice echoes ] Well ... [ Rumble ] Worth : I guess that proves our theory . Numbers . Kazan : Four . Two . Three . Clear . [ Rumble ] Both : Kazan ! [ Rumble ] [ Panting ] Kazan : [ Wailing ] Listen . He hasn 't moved far . I 'll go find him . What do you think ? You don 't have a lot of lives left . Oh ! Oh ! [ Grunt of landing ] Kazan : Oh ! [ Whimpering ] [ Gasp ] [ Clicking of handle ] [ Opening of portal ] Kazan ? I didn 't move . Good . But you 're going to climb up here , okay ? I don 't like that . 14 , 26 , 14 . Worth , get back here right now . Five bags of gum drops . 27 bags total . 27 bags . Deal . Leaven : Listen to me , worth . This room 's next move takes us to the bridge . We 're coming . [ Rumble ] Over here . Leaven : Move it . We don 't have much time . Come on . [ Rumble ] [ Gasps ] [ Moaning ] Worth ? Worth ! [ Moan ] oh ! Oh , this better be it . It ... It should be . [ Groan ] Where ? [ Sigh ] [ Click of release ] [ Whistling of wind ] Oh , well . [ Closing of portal ] Give it a minute . Be patient . So , guess what ? No ! This is the room we started in . I was right . We should never have moved in the first place . [ Rumble ] [ Click of release ] [ Opening of portal ] Huh ! The bridge . Red . Kazan . Kazan : Four , two , Four . Clear . [ Closing of portal ] [ Click of release ] [ Opening of portal ] [ Music ] [ Moan ] Worth ? Go ahead . What are you doing ? You can 't quit now . It 's not your fault . I have nothing to live for out there . What is out there ? Worth : The boundless human stupidity . I can live with that . [ Gasp ] [ Wheezing ] [ Coughing ] [ Howling ] No-o-o ! [ Grunt of attack ] Kazan : [ Moaning ] [ Grunts of struggle ] Kazan , get out through the door . Kazan : [ Wailing ] [ Grunts of struggle ] [ Groan ] [ Laboured breathing ] [ Rumble ] [ Turning of handle ] Red , Kazan . [ Rumble ] [ Grunts of effort ] [ Howling ] [ Groan ] [ Music ]

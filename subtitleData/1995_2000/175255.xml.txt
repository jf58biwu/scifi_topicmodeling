 Ronny ? Hey , it 's Lise . I know , I know . I want to , baby , but I just can 't . I 've basically been , like , abducted . I don 't know , but she looks a lot like my older sister . Yeah , the Surgeon General . You know . Me too . Ditto . Listen , I can 't talk here . Take my number and call me back . It 's area code 303 , 560 ... Ronny ? Jenny ! That was low . That was really low . Thank you so much . OK , fine . I 'll stay a month . That won 't be so bad , right ? No offence , it 's just I don 't think Snowfield can exactly compare to LA activity wise . And , besides , like Mom 's gonna need me to go back soon . Mom will be fine , Lisa . Anyway , it 's healthier up here . Less smog , less gunfire . I like smog . I like gunfire . Less Ronny . Oh , you don 't even know him . I know the type . He 's cute . They always are . Well , how many people live here ? Four hundred in the winter . In the summer , with the tourists it can be 4000 . I guess it 's kind of cute in a dorky sort of way . Is it always this quiet ? No . No , it isn 't . Hilda , we 're home ! You 'll love Hilda housekeeper of the gods . When I left this morning she was promising apple pie . Hmm . No message . Jenny , Jenny ! Go , go stand over there . Go ! Looks like somebody beat the shit out of her . No . She died suddenly . How do you know ? There 's no blood . There 's no sign of struggle . God . The phone 's dead . Being out of order now it 's kinda strange , don 't ya think ? What if she was killed ? What if the killer 's still in the house ? Shit ! Police station 's four blocks . We 'll walk . OK . You OK ? Mmm . I feel like I 'm gonna be sick . OK , we 're almost there . It 's a disease , Jenny ! Just wait . Screw waiting , Jenny ! I don 't want to die like this . Lisa , we 're not gonna die , OK ? We 're gonna be fine . Calm down . Why calm down ? You brought me here ! I 'm sorry . You 're just scared . I am too . Just let me do this . Check the phone . OK . Anybody . Nothing . Weren 't shooting at a disease were you , Paul ? He got off three rounds . More . He 's a pro , right ? I mean , he hits what he aims at . So ? Where 's the blood , Jenny ? If it 's a disease why do you need a gun ? Whatever . Do you know how to use it ? I understand the concept . It 's like this . See ? LA 's good for somethin ' . Everybody 's dead . No , it can 't be . Not a whole town . Is there a nuke plant around here ? No . Big military base ? No . I thought maybe ... it 's radiation ? Radiation doesn 't kill in a blink . Besides , there 'd be burns , lesions . It was running before . I saw it . Jacob and Anna Lieberman . This is their bakery , they 're always here . Let 's go around the back . Come on . Something 's up there . Keep moving ! Jacob ! Anna ? The stump 's like cauterized . It 's some freaking maniac . One maniac couldn 't have wiped out a whole town . It 's just a Bundt cake . It 's just a Bundt cake . Not that way , out the front ! Who are you ? What do you want ? Come on . How ya doin ' ? What the hell 's goin ' on here ? Stu , let 's go ! Stu . Stu , you OK ? Yeah . Fine . Good . Can we go yet ? No , not yet . OK . I want to get a forensics guy down here , right ? I want three sheriff 's deputies . You can 't do that . Sheriff Hammond . What ? You can 't bring more people here . Why ? There could be a toxic component . Toxic ? Oh , yeah . Whatever got those two was definitely toxic . Those people were decapitated . But not your deputy , Henderson , or my housekeeper . That was something else . We should get them out of here . You don 't know what this is . OK , just calm down a second . You 've got to be certain . Doctor ! I 'm in charge here . All right ? I 'm gonna go outside get on the radio and I 'm gonna figure this thing out . OK ? Here . Let 's go . Paul Henderson was on the phone to us at HQ . The line just went dead . We got here as soon as we could . He used to be FBI like me and Bryce . He was a good cop . If Paul was attacked why didn 't he see it coming ? Paul didn 't make mistakes . Just one . Ex cuse me ? If anybody was alive wouldn 't that have brought them out ? Those lights that 's the Candleglow Inn . Stu ! All right , Steve bring them along . Stu . Stu . Hey ! Stu ! Are you OK ? Yeah . OK . ' Cause I need you to be OK here . All right ? I 'm OK . You OK ? Yeah . OK , then . Since you 've been here have you heard any barking ? Barking ? No . Seen any dogs or cats ? No . Well , it 's off season . There are only four rooms booked , all upstairs . There might be someone in the manager 's apartment down here . Where you want to start ... Chief ? Holy shit . Hi . You wanna tell me what happened here ? What are you doin ' , Stu ? Oh , Jesus . I was , uh ... I was just , uh ... Lookin ' for clues . Yeah . Watch the hallway , all right ? OK . You OK ? Yeah . You feel sick ? No , good . Doctor ? Stay here . Be careful . Watch the hallway , Stu . This door was locked from the inside . I had to break it open . There 's nobody in there so ... how 'd she get out ? Through a window ? There is no window . Look at this . Hey . You wanna see somethin ' ? What ? You wanna see somethin ' ? No . Who 's Timothy Flyte ? I have no idea . I was hoping you would know . He 's no one local . Is it one of the killers ? I assume so . A woman was escaping from this guy Flyte , writes on the mirror . Why be obscure ? Why not write a clear message ? She wrote it in lipstick ... but where 's the tube ? Vanished along with whoever used it from a locked , windowless room . What is this ? Well , whatever it is it wasn 't here before . That 's a gold tooth . Like Nazis . Concentration camps . They leave anything of value . But this is just junk ... Don 't touch it . Buttons . Strips ' em right to their skins . Beyond the skin . Enny , what is that ? It 's a pacemaker . You gotta be kiddin ' me . Now , this guy ... This guy 's got an edge . There 's been no guest named Timothy Flyte . There are seven people checked into those four rooms . We found one body . Where 's everybody else ? Maybe they 're still alive . Somewhere . Mmm . I think we were supposed to find that message on the mirror . I 'm gonna run the name " Flyte " by headquarters and see what ... Bryce . What ? I don 't like this , man . That was not here before ! No way . We 'd have seen it . Help ! Help me ! Bryce , cover me ! Steve , wait ! No ! The message read " Timothy Flyte , the Ancient Enemy . " That 's F L Y T E. 'Ten four , Sheriff . ' Set up a roadblock at the Snowfield turn off . Close the entire town down . Nothing comes in and nothing gets out . And I want federal assistance . Armed federal specialists . 'Receiving poorly . Ten one . ' Fort Sherwood has an antiterrorist unit for bacteriological threats . 'Breaking up . ' Come on ! No ! Fort Sherwood . I want the whole strike force . Big firepower , full analytical assistance . Send everyone they have . I have one , possibly two officers dead . I may even have hundreds dead . 'Cannot read ... ' Jesus , Joe ! Come on , Joe ! Hello ? Same thing I heard on the phone . They didn 't get the message . That means there won 't be any help coming . Of course there will , Lisa . Not in time . So , guess we 're on our own . Whoa . Wait a minute , Stu . Hey ! Nobody 's goin ' off on their own here . We still have a chain of command . This has to be a managed response . Managed response ? I 'm sorry , Sheriff . I don 't have my book on me . Is that an FBI term ? What 's your problem , Stu ? Nothin ' . I 'm just tryin ' to learn to be a better cop . You know what ? That doctor sure is cute . I 'm not gonna have this conversation with you , Stu . What conversation ? Any conversation . It seemed like the two of you were hittin ' it off . Be a shame to ... I don 't know what your problem is but it 's not funny . I know what you 're tryin ' to do so fuckin ' cut it out . I like the little sister , though . You notice how ... Stop ! Stop ! Cut it out ! Shut up ! All right ? Enough . Oh , oh , oh , oh ! Easy , Chief . Easy . I got witnesses . Why don 't you just calm down ? Ow . Sheriff , is that what you meant when you said a " managed response " ? Who are you ? What was that ? It came from over here . No , here ! The window ! What ? Is that a bird ? No way . Even if help 's coming it 's not gonna be till daybreak . I wouldn 't worry . Whatever it was won 't be comin ' back in here . What makes you so sure of that ? Well , for one thing we probably just shot it about 30 times , Sheriff . Well ... doesn 't mean it 's dead . Oh , no ! Oh ... It ate through his face . Consumed the eyes most of the soft tissue and the entire brain . Which is impossible the brain weighs six or seven pounds . It just devoured it in in seconds . And it almost got Lisa . No . It wanted Deputy Wargle first . It wants men like him most of all . What do you mean it wants men like him ? Well , it 's the devil don 't you think ? Come up from hell tonight ? I think he wants to dance with us . Dr Flyte ? Wilson and Hawthorne , FBI . We 're just here to ask you a few questions about a series of articles you 've written . The FBI reads Wide World News ? Only if it 's about the ... " Ancient Enemy " . They 're based on a treatise I published while at Oxford . Got you kicked of the faculty . They weren 't quite that rude . It 's a pretty radical theory . I used to believe that any theory once published with evidence then became open to discussion and debate . But I learned how envious vindictive and vicious the academic community can be . They 're swine . Polite swine , but swine , nonetheless . Convincing the world to consider a new idea takes patience , perseverance and a willingness to fight the good fight in any media forum one can . Which is why a big paleobiologist like yourself works here . No , I need the money . We 'd like you to come with us . Why ? I 've merely exercised my rights to ... It 's a matter of national security . You OK ? How do you think your sister 's holding up ? I don 't know . She 's had a rough time . Our mother is not exactly the best role model . How do you mean ? She drinks . I thought bringing Lisa up here would ... help . Help you or help her ? Both of us . I have this need to ... take charge . Yeah . I noticed that . So , Harvard ... a few years with the FBI ... What are you doin ' here ? Yeah . See . He had a gun ... He was hiding in a closet and the gun turned out to be a toy . Carrying his picture around with you ? Why torture yourself ? He shouldn 't be forgotten . I need an escort . Uh , I 'll I 'll do it . OK . You 're all set . This is so embarrassing . I 'll be right outside . OK . God damn it . Don 't be stupid . You wanna see somethin ' ? You ... are so fuckin ' cute ! No ! God , he 's in there ! Jenny ! There was nobody in there . Yes , there was . They couldn 't just evaporate . That bathroom at the inn no windows , a locked door . Yes ! Hey ! They 're here ! Thank God . What the hell ? Come on ! Reconnaissance . Infrared photography . He 's not gonna stop . Get your stuff . I 'm gonna get you out of here . I am a legal resident of the United States . I have the same civil rights as you . If I 'm under arrest I have the right to an attorney . If I 'm not under arrest this could easily be construed as kidnapping . If you people at this newspaper know where Elvis is , we 'd like to know . What ? We 've been looking for him for a long time . Yes , sir . The King sure is slippery . You can 't stay here alone , 40 miles from any place , anybody . Somebody 's got to be here when the Feds show up . Just go , OK ? Come on . All right . Pop the hood . You gotta be kidding me . Looks like it 's been crushed in a hydraulic press . Help me ! Help me , please ! No one 's really out there . It 's just trying to bait us like your deputy at the inn . OK . Let 's Let 's go back inside . Guns won 't do it , General . We 're not just about guns , Doctor . Why not shoot me dead , right here right now , and save a lot of trouble ? Do you people hire only stunt drivers ? We 're interested in this " Ancient Enemy " . Not the tabloid stuff the hard science . I assume that history is filled with mysterious disappearances for which nobody can provide adequate , logical explanations . For instance ? December 10 , 1939 in the hills outside Nanking , China an army of 3000 Chinese soldiers vanished without a trace long before they reached the battlefield . No bodies , no graves , no witnesses . Consider the Mayan cities of Copan Piedras Negras , Palenque in 610 AD deserted overnight , hundreds of thousands of Mayans missing . Theories of disease or war don 't explain why there were no mass graves and evidence shows that Mayan families vanished after preparing elaborate dinners but before eating them . And there 's the disappearance of the English colony on Roanoke Island North Carolina in 1590 . Many others . Many . Just what is this ... thing ? Chaos . Chaos in the flesh . This is our field lab . It 's bacteriologically secure and can withstand point blank mortar fire . No terrorist can take this thing out . We 're operating on the basis of a broken communication from Snowfield . And area recon , both inconclusive . Our scientific team is grouped to cover every possible contingency . Let me remind you that Dr Flyte 's name was found in Snowfield . One of the victims scrawled it on a mirror . It was a desperate dying act , but the victim must have seen something to lend some credence to Dr Flyte 's theory . Well , uh , breakfast and dinner are here . We 're never gonna get out of here , none of us . Hey , listen . I don 't know what this thing is , but it 's playing with us ... The lights , the noises on the phone the moth with Wargle . I don 't know what it wants but if we keep our heads straight we 're gonna get out of here I promise you . How can you be so sure ? Maybe we are gonna make it . Sheriff Hammond . I heard deputies Wargle and Shannon were here . Yes , they were , uh ... They were killed during the night . Then it is ongoing . The name on the mirror . How do you fit into this ? Reluctantly . The first thing we need to know is what we 're dealing with what kind of threat it is ... biological , chemical or other . Well , I 'm ... I 'm leaning toward " other " . Come on ! Pick it up ! Move , move ! Bernstein house , 214 Vail Street . They were about to have dinner ... when something happened . Recording . Residence of Dr Jennifer Pailey . Kitchen . Evidence of severe trauma perhaps toxicological injury . In the 48 hours prior to the events did your office receive any reports of power failures , telephone interruptions , lights in the sky ? No flying saucers if that 's what you mean . Should be a major junction box here . We 'll tap into it , power up the lab . Doctor ! Look at this . Recording . At the base of the statue of Mary ... Al almost like an an offering . There 's a large accumulation of metal buttons wristwatches , jewellery ... Everything metal . Not an offering , undigested remains . And a little something preserved and put aside for later ... like a spider might do it . Got something , Harker . Looks like some kind of breach in the trunk lines . That would account for the interrupted phone service . Where 's it comin ' from ? It 's nothing . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Hold it , God damn it ! Get it off me ! Oh , Jesus ! It 's sludge , man ! It 's just plain old stinking ' sewage . Oh , my God . 'Velazquez you make that connection ? ' Somebody there ? 'Velazquez , what do you got ? ' In the next tunnel . Velazquez , what the hell is that ? Get out of there . Move your ass and get out now ! No ! Velazquez , get out of there ! Move it ! Now ! Aaah ! Help me . Help me , Jesus ! Get out of there ! Come on ! Reach ! Reach , man . Come on ! Reach ! Velazquez ! Jesus Christ ! Sergeant Harker meet me outside CBW right now ! I 'm registering no toxic fumes . Here , fella . Here , boy . At least he lived through it . Come on . But how did he live through it ? Yeah , yeah . That 's a good dog . It 's OK . That 's a good dog , huh ? That 's a good boy . It 's OK . Yeah . Better ... Better get away from him . You like that , don 't ya ? Christ , what the hell ? What is it ? Get back ! No ! Oh , my God ! Sergeant , get up here ! Flyte . You were brought here , Dr Flyte . Do your research . Write the gospel . Go . It 's here ! It 's everywhere all around us ! Oh , Jesus . Dr Flyte , what is this ? My flesh . Study it . Write the gospel . But do not try to leave . Witnesses to the miracle . I have to run an analysis . And that 's what I was born to do . That lab is a tank . We are getting in that and getting the hell out of here right now . Against this thing the lab 's vulnerable . There are a hundred ways it could stop us . Why aren 't we dead like the rest of them ? I think it needed us to get to Flyte . It 's like he 's some kind of disciple or something . " Write the gospel . " And now Flyte 's here . If it can think really think then we 're finished . Maybe it 's like flatworm learning . What ? Certain flatworms can learn to negotiate a maze . Then if you grind them up and feed them to another batch of flatworms batch two can run the same maze on the first try . They absorb the knowledge with the flesh . They gave me a tour on the way . The oldest living thing on the planet . We would 've heard of it by now . It wasn 't exactly shy . It lives out of sight in the earth in deep geological structures . But if it comes up to feed ... Rarely . Mostly it sifts life forms from the soil like a whale sifts tiny krill and plankton from the ocean . No doubt it feeds on marine life too . It may lie dormant between feedings for years or even decades at a time . Over centuries only a tiny percentage of this thing 's prey has been human beings but from them it 's absorbed knowledge , acquired intelligence . So this thing can assume the form of anything that it 's absorbed . Or maybe even imaginary creatures . Anything a victim may have seen in a movie ... or even dreamed about . It must know everything the people in this town knew . About you , Dr Flyte . And about me . What 's happening ? Vocal mode initiated . Tell the world the end begins here . Who are you ? I am Baal . I am Belial . Demons . Devils . Some of its victims must have thought it was the devil . It absorbed that concept from them ... and believes that 's what it is . Why have you killed these people ? They are cattle . But you let us live . One of your species has theorised my existence . It 's like a monkey learning tricks . Flyte . He is my Matthew Mark , Luke and John . Only in me can you achieve immortality . Not in God . Not in Christ . Only in me . If we do what you say will you let us live ? Hold on ! What 's happening ? It 's playing with us ! Warning : Lab stability is threatened . All right , enough ! It 's not a god ! It 's not a devil ! It 's just a fucking animal and any living thing can be killed ! This thing wiped out the dinosaurs which were pretty tough fucking customers ! What do you want me to say ? All I 'm saying is , it 's got a weakness ! What weakness ? Ego ! It thinks it 's Satan , right ? Satan had the biggest ego of all thinking he was greater than God . And he took a fall . Right ! That 's why it turned this town into a fun house . That 's why it manipulated us into bringing Dr Flyte here . It wanted you to see it . It wanted you to ! Show me how to kill this fuckin ' thing . If there were a way to kill it we wouldn 't have been given the tissue sample ! You 're not listening to me ! It only thinks it 's all powerful . It 's lived too long without fear . Millions of years it 's lived where nothing could kill it . That 's what makes it vulnerable . So what are all these other things we 've seen ? Drones . Phantoms . Detached . Sent on a task then they return to the mother mass underground . Warning : Lab stability is threatened . Guess so . How big is this thing ? Big . How do you know any of this for sure ? Logical deduction . Logical deduction . Yeah . This from a guy who writes articles about Bigfoot for a living . What about chemicals or acid ? You 'd need a truckload . And how would you deliver it to the target ? Maybe nukes ? Same problem . How do you find the target , bomb it and be sure you got it all ? Warning : Microbe sample vault is open . Warning : Microbe sample vault is open . Thank you . You 're welcome . You OK ? I was just wondering . What ? Do you think that all those people it 's taken ... Do you think they 're still trapped ? No . No . They 're gone . They 're dead and gone . I think being trapped inside of it would be like your soul gone to hell . It 's not that way . I don 't want to go to hell . What ? You 've got something ? Petrolatum . This thing is a lot more complex than the composition ... of petroleum jelly , of course but there are similarities ... in the ratio of hydrocarbons and even more minerals and chemicals than you 'd find in the human body . Hydrocarbons . I wonder ... What is it ? Samples of bacteria , virus plus a selection of man made microbes . Oh , glorious day . On the double . CBW one twenty three this is Command Post . Do you copy ? What do you got , Guthrie ? CBW hasn 't reported in . I can 't raise them . Major , I think you better check this out . Jenny ? It 's all right . It could hear us only through the electronics . Not now . What 's in the vial ? Biosan Fourteen a genetically engineered bacteria . A man made disease ? No . Harmless to us . It 's a working bacterium . Eats crude oil and ex cretes ecologically harmless byproducts . They use it to break up oil spills for about a decade now . Biosan Fourteen is new the most aggressive strain yet . It can survive only in an oil rich environment but then each microorganism reproduces itself every 11 seconds . It could swarm through oil . Ever since the Gulf War they 've carried a sample in case terrorists ever contaminate an oil field with it . Wait , wait , wait , wait . You 're saying we can use this stuff to attack the Ancient Enemy of yours like it was an oil spill and infect it ? If its hydrocarbon structures are similar to petroleum . It 's a big stretch , but ... It 's gonna wonder why the power 's off . It 'll know we 're up to something . No . It doesn 't fear us . It believes it 's immortal . Well , maybe it is . Is one vial enough ? If it reproduces every 11 seconds , we could culture a lot more in an hour . True . OK , what do we need ? We need to find a way to get at the mother mass and we need some kind of a delivery system for this stuff . But if we do that will it kill it all ? Unless there 's a nucleus a small inner core that can tear loose from the mass and survive on its own . You know , I really just wanted you to say " yes " . Jesus Christ . I only want to tell the world . So , how do you propose to draw the whole mass of it to us ? What ? No . No . Oh , no . I 'm here . Your witness . If I 'm to tell the world I need to see ... all of you , not just a drone . You wonder what 's going on in there . They 're preparing a weapon possibly a means to destroy you . I don 't fuckin ' believe him . He 's selling us out . He 's trying to save his own ass . Wait . For what ? For him to play his hand . Specifically , it 's a genetically engineered bacterium ... capable of devouring your flesh . Capable , they think , of killing you . What they don 't understand is that death is for mortals not for gods . Even after all they 've witnessed tonight , they still don 't believe . They still think you 're only an animal only a thing . Show yourself . Gods have nothing to fear . Or do they ? Uh , uh , n now ... N n now w would be a g good time . Now ! It 's really pissed off . Infected . Jenny , Lisa , in the lab . Run ! I think we got it , Jenny ! We 've gotta get off the street . Come on ! I think it 's infected . Maybe . Oh , come on . It 's crawling away to die . Which makes it even more dangerous . Oh , fuck you ! Dead yet ? Let 's just go . Come on , you bastard . Oh , you got some guns . Ladies , you wouldn 't shoot an unarmed man , would you ? That 's a dumb question . You wanna see somethin ' ? What a trip I 've had ! How low can you go ? Get down ! Go ! Hey ! You girls slip me a Mickey ? Oh , God ! What did you do to me ? Lisa ? I 'm going to let you live . Let you live in me forever . Fuck you ! Always that urge to shoot little boys . No . This time I 'm gonna miss . It 's all right . It 's gone . All those souls , maybe ... they 're at peace . Yes . One wonders . Still , it won . What do you mean ? It wanted me to tell the world and that 's what I 'm going to do . The Earth endures . Over the aeons , countless species have flourished , then perished . In the town of Snowfield four of us ... met and bested an inhuman intelligence . Not from the stars , but from the deep and secret realms ... of our own infinitely mysterious world . A supremely powerful life form so adaptable , seemingly immortal ... is it gone ? If not , it may one day be the cause of humanity 's extinction . You believe that crap ? I don 't know , Frank . Stranger things have happened . I mean , Patty said Glenn was abducted by aliens . Glenn wasn 't abducted . He run off to LA . You would , too if you was married to Patty . Does that sound funny to you , officer ? No , ma 'am . Hey , you wanna see somethin ' ?

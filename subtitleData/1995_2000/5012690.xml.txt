 There are some things in life that transcend time and national boundaries . Music , love , the bond between parent and child . Things like these have no language . They exist in the heart , in the memory , and nothing can erase them . Sometimes , though , it takes a kind of miracle to bring things back to light . Yuri Rosanova ! WOMAN Good morning . It 's 6 : 30 in the city of broad shoulders , and here 's the new ... Yeah , morning to you , too . What the ... ? What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * All right , come on , now just consider it before you toss it in the trash . Okay . It 's a bad idea . It is not a bad idea . We are dying on Thursday nights . We need a new angle . Angle , yes . Gimmick , no . Look , it is not a gimmick . Gimmicks are cheap . I am not cheap . Okay . What about last week ? Free meals for gay divorcees ? Come on ! That was a brilliant idea ! That was innovative ! And this is a gimmick . Uh-uh-uh - let 's ask a true connoisseur . A man with vision . A man with taste . Okay , what do you think ? Thursday nights , karaoke . Thursday night karaoke ? I think that 's a terrible idea . Thank you . What the hell does he know ? This guy puts ketchup on his filet . Yeah . Look at this , would you ? What is it ? Well , I don 't know . It 's-it 's-it 's different . It 's - what ? It 's Russian . It 's written in Russian . You know Russian ? Yeah . I gavareet a bit of Rooskee . You gotta be kidding me ? No . Why should I be kidding you ? What do you think Fishman is ? Irish ? Comes from Fishniak . My grandparents are from Moscow . Russian 's practically my second language . What does that say ? " Bootineet puchees neokee ... " In English . Okay . Don 't rush me . It 's written in Cyrillic . Maybe you ought to try singing it . Something about ... Spam . Stop while you 're behind , Chuck . Okay , so I 'm a little rusty ! What do you think I am ? Dostoyevsky ? I gotta get this translated now . What 's the hurry ? I don 't know if there is a hurry , but I do know that that article 's not in there for any accident . Uh-oh . What ? This wasn 't here before . What ? What is it ? " A 32-year-old mother-to-be died yesterday morning " after being struck by a taxi cab in downtown Chicago . " The cab driver , " involved in an argument with his passenger , reportedly never saw the victim . " When is it gonna happen ? 9 : 00 . Wait a minute . " Meeer pajalsta volkie ... " Hey , Gar , remember - think karaoke . Oh , finally something simple . You gotta be kidding me . Driver , can you turn it down ? Driver ! What ? ! It 's too loud . What 's too loud ? The music . It 's supposed to be loud . It 's Shostakovich . Look out ! Slow down ! What was that ? ! Concerto in A Minor . What , are you nuts ? ! You could get hurt running out like that ! Oh , yeah , yeah , you tell me about it . I had to stop you . You were about to hit someone ... Oh , yeah ? Oh , well , next time try yelling " Taxi " from the curb , like everybody else . Driver , what are you doing ? Smelling roses . No damage . Oh , boy , are you a lucky guy . I 'm lucky ? ! Look , let me tell you something , pal - I practically just saved your life ! Oh , yeah ? Well , how do you figure that ? How do I figure that ? I 'll tell you how I figure that . I figure that because - because I 'm a good figurer , that 's how . Well , let me give you a bit of advice from someone who knows absolutely nothing - always watch out for your own life . Nobody else will . Back in Russia , we got a saying ... That 's it . I 'm walking . You can forget about your fare . Good . Dos Vadanya . Dos Vadanya - You say you 're from Russia ? Who wants to know ? I want to know . Listen , you read that to me ? Huh . Ignore it . It 's nothing . Pay no attention . Yeah , well , just tell me what it says , would you ? It says there was a fire at the consulate . At the consulate . Which consulate ? Russian . The Russian consulate . But this is not true . I drove by there this morning - no fire . Well - Take me there . Why ? Because I want to go there . Sorry . I can 't drive today . What do you mean , you can 't drive today ? It 's your job ! All right . Hey , that 's my cab ! Uh ... You can 't do this ! You crazy American ! Ladies and gentlemen , may I have your attention , please ? May I have your attention , please ? If you would all take your places , we would like to begin . I know you 're all anxious to meet our guests . Once we 've completed the introductions , there will be plenty of time for questions from the press . Please . Thank you for joining us . Good to see you again . Thank you very much . Ladies and gentlemen , it is my great pleasure as Consul General to welcome today two most distinguished visitors from our homeland . The distinguished Russian ambassador ... Welcome , sir . And on her first international concert tour , our own national treasure , Paulina Rosanova . Thank you . It is my great pleasure to finally be in the country I 've heard so much about . I look forward to playing for all of you . I hope I live up to my reputation . Nice driving ! You have maybe Russian blood ? ! Here . Come on . I might need your help . Me ? No , sorry . I can 't . Not today . Personal reasons . Look , get on the radio . You get the fire department over here now . Why ? I told you it was nonsense . Besides , it happened yesterday . Yeah , yeah . Mister , wait . Take care of the girl . What ? The one with the violin . The ... Go ! Go , go ! Da , da . Miss Rosanova , is it true the violin you 'll be playing on this tour is the one your father gave you when you were a child ? Yes . I only wish he could have been here today to see how far it has brought me . Uh , excuse me . Uh , excuse me , uh ... There , uh ... Hi . How do you do ? There - there 's gonna be a fire here . There 's supposed to - there 's-there 's , uh - there 's-there 's gonna be a fire here , and I , uh ... Well ... There ! My violin ! Sir , come with me . What , are you crazy ? ! Get away from there ! I can 't ! My - My violin ! I got it ! Are you all right ? I think so . My violin ... You saved my life . No , I-I don 't think I saved your life . I just , uh ... Well , how did you know ? Well , I-I didn 't know . I , I didn 't ... I ... uh ... Who are you ? Uh ... Gary Hobson . I 'm Gary Hobson . How do you do ? Ow ! Don 't be such a baby . Keep still and it won 't hurt . You sure you know what you 're doing ? Why shouldn 't I ? Well , I ... I 'm a musician , Mr. Hobson , not a porcelain doll . How is he ? Oh , it 's a little burned around the edges , but I think I 'll live . Thank you . You 're lucky . Real lucky . Security thinks it was an incendiary device . They set the fire ? Perhaps as a diversion for something else . Diversion by who ? In our country we call them cherke . Here you say " mafia . " The Russian variety . They control many things in the old Soviet Union and wish to control more now . We need to be careful with you and the ambassador . Once again , my thanks . Uh ... Ah ... Do you feel anything ? Oh , yeah . I mean , it 's , uh , feels fine . Thank you . Well , it 's the least I could do . You saved something very precious to me . I don 't think I could have done the tour without my violin . Why not ? It was a gift from my father . Many , many years ago . Everything I am I owe to him . When he died , I vowed I would dedicate my life and music to him . It 's crazy , huh ? No , I don 't ... I don 't think it 's crazy . It 's just , uh ... Well , I 'd better be going . Wait , but you ... you didn 't answer my question . How did you know ? How did I know ? I wish I knew . Perhaps another time . Yeah . So ... Paulina Rosanova , huh ? The concert violinist . I believe Newsweek called her the " Mournful Angel of Moscow . " Yes , they did that . The one with the cheekbones . This is perfect . This what ? Well , you saved her violin , right ? So , now she owes you . You know , I hate to ask , but , uh , owes what ? She plays here Thursday nights . Oh ! You gotta be out of your mind ! No , imagine : Black tie , fine crystal , we dim the lights . She comes out wearing something very sexy . She starts with the standards : Shostakovich , Rastapovich , all of the " iches . " And then , she segues into , you know , the old stuff like , uh , hillbilly music , bluegrass ! She 's a concert violinist , Chuck . Okay , okay , forget the bluegrass . What do you think , Gare ? What do I think ? Yeah . Well , I think , uh , I think I agree with her . You know what ? You guys have no imagination . Oh , don 't worry , I 'll get it . You got something to say ? You got a thing for her , don 't you ? What makes you say that ? Vibes . Vibes ? Mm-hmm . Well , after all , she is the " Mournful Angel of Moscow , " isn 't she ? I got things to do . You still don 't want to talk about her , do you ? No , I don 't want to talk about her . You know why ? 'Cause there 's nothing to talk about . These were addressed to you , Matilda . I told you not to call me that . " How about dinner ? " Mmm ! Roses . How Russian . Need a lift , Mister ? What do you want ? You owe me six bucks . For the cab fare this morning . Lucky for you , I 'm a generous man . Hey ... How long you been waiting out here ? No time at all . Purely coincidence . Nice clothes . Men 's Wearhouse ? Look , if it 's all right with you , I 'm late for a dinner . With who ? That 's none of your business , with who . All right , forget the six bucks . We 'll start fresh . From zero , huh ? Well , thank you very much , but I 'll walk . So , how did things go today at the consulate ? Fine , thank you . She 's okay ? She 's not hurt ? No , she ... Why are you so interested in Paulina ? Have you ever heard her play ? No . Then what 's the use explaining ? She lets you call her Paulina ? Well , yeah , she let me call - What do you care what she let me call her ? ! Whoops , the radio 's beeping . Gotta go . Now , wait a second , hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Nice talking to you ! To America , land of tall buildings . And to baseball . And traffic . And ... Strangers who rescue violinists from fiery deaths . That , too . What ? You know , when one is famous , especially in my country , it 's hard to find people who will just be themselves . The way you rushed in today I thought , " This man is special . " His own person . Yet there is something else . What might that be ? I was hoping you would tell me . How did you know ? About the fire ? Perhaps . It 's , uh , some kind of gift you have , isn 't it ? Well , it 's - that 's , uh , that 's , uh ... That 's hard to explain , actually . Uh ... I understand . You do ? Sometimes , when I 'm playing that violin - the one that my father gave me - the strangest thing happens . I can be on stage in front of a thousand people , and just for a moment , it 's as if I 'm all alone , and he is standing right beside me . Not a ghost , but real . Right nearby . Can you explain that ? No . No . You see ? We are connected . Thank you . I had a lovely time . I hope you did , too . You didn 't give me a chance to say it . Perhaps I didn 't dare . Perhaps it 's a good thing that you didn 't dare . But all the same , I did have a good time and thank you . Good . I play tomorrow at the consulate . Prokofiev . I hope you can come . But no fire this time , huh ? No fire . Oh ... Let me get that . This is you ? Yes . It 's me on my tenth birthday . And this is ... ? My father . Was my father . Oh , I 'm sorry . No , it 's okay . Take care of the hand . I 'll see you tomorrow . Okay . MAN Got a customer at ... Yes , mon ? Where you want to go ? Wherever these things go at night ... take me there . No problem . Excuse me . Where to ? No , no , I don 't need a cab . I 'm looking for someone . He 's , uh , he 's Russian . So is everyone else here . Name ? Yuri , and , uh , I didn 't get his last name . Yuri ? Yeah . Is he here ? I 'm afraid not . Perhaps I can help you . Victor Choledenko . Ahh ! You 're , uh , you 're in charge ? I am in charge , yes . Yeah , well , is he here ? It 's pretty important I talk to him . May I ask , uh , what about ? No , it 's kind of personal , actually . Of course . I understand . But there is a problem . He no longer works here . I just saw him today . You see how things happen so near and yet so far ? Yuri quit this evening . Left town , no address . Can you imagine ? Huh . Just got up and left town , huh ? Of course , if you would wish to leave a message , perhaps he will contact me , and then I could pass it along , but only if you like . Yeah , yeah . Well , why don 't you tell , uh , Yuri that I came by to give him a ticket to a concert that I think he might want to go to . And your name ? My name is Gary Hobson . He 'll remember me . He took me to the consulate today . Well , why don 't you leave the ticket with me ? Why would I want to do that ? He left town . May I call you a cab ? No . You took him to the consulate ? What else haven 't you told me ? Perhaps I should be asking you this . The fire at the consulate ... people could have been killed . Was that you ? My friend , I 'm surprised . I thought we agreed we would never speak of these things . In any event , no harm was done . Everything is fine . Just be sure and stay away from this man . He could cause you great trouble . And that would grieve me , truly . I got a feeling you 're looking for this , Yuri . I figured you 'd get the message . Do I get it or not - the ticket ? Oh , yes , yes , after you tell me one thing . Which is ? You 're her father , aren 't you ? Yes . Except for one thing . And what 's that ? Her father is dead . Why do you want to hear this ? Last night I listened to a woman tell me about her father , who she made out to be one of the most important men in the world . The only thing is , she thinks that her father 's been dead for 15 years , but he isn 't . Now , you tell me , Yuri , or I 'm gonna call the cops . Yuri Rosanova . A great man . A musical genius . A moral giant . That 's what she said , isn 't it ? Pretty close . I want you to look all around this room , Mr. Hobson . Do you see such a man standing here ? The answer is no . He doesn 't exist . Well , she 's walking around on this planet , so he must have , once . Ah ... who can remember ? Such a long time ago . Things were different then . You were a musician . A journeyman , a hack . I was lucky to work once or twice in a year . But Paulina , oh ... From the time she was six she had the gift . Oh , she could play like an angel . The first time I heard , I knew this was a miracle . She needed schooling . She needed an instrument . These things cost money , so I took a job with a friend . I asked no questions . After all , what could possibly go wrong ? He had connections . But something did go wrong . That night I became an enemy of the party , a criminal . So long as I lived , my daughter would suffer . Her gift would be lost . I had no time , so I did what I thought was best . If I died , her life might be spared , so that night I ceased to exist . So now you know . Any questions ? Yeah , about a hundred of ' em , but let me start with this one . Look , the Soviet Union is broken up . Have you thought about going back ? Uh , maybe if ... Maybe , maybe not . What about my daughter ? What would she think when her father the martyr shows up on her doorstep after 15 years in the grave ? Well , I don 't know . I would imagine she 'd be thrilled . Are you sure ? Are you really sure ? I don 't understand . Yes , I know . You never saw me . Now , wait a second . Well , just hang on a second here , would you ? Let me get this straight . Now , you 've got a daughter on the other side of the city who thinks you 've been dead for 15 years , and you 're not even going to let her know you exist ? She wouldn 't believe me if I did . Wait a minute , would you ? Just , just wait a minute now . Yuri , take the ticket and go see your daughter play . Thank you . * * ... rise and shine . It 's morning in Chicago , and there 's plenty happening out there for you to do today . Not already . You know , driving into work this morning , the freeways ... All right . ... the sun was breaking ... Not again . Okay , I got it this time . " Rabbit Marinates in Melatonin . " What ? That 's wrong , that 's wrong . " Rabbit Beats Little Boy . " Oh , gosh , this is hopeless , Chuck . All right , I 'm sorry , okay ? I haven 't spoke Russian since I was seven , since my Grandma Olga died , okay ? Look ... I can read two of the words - " Lincoln Park . " Let 's go . Me ? Come on , I might need a translator . Auf Wiedersehen . See you . God , it 's such a beautiful day . I wish we didn 't have to spend it rescuing people . Come on , get out . And do what ? Oh , do what ? Just look around . Yeah , excuse me , can you take me to the , uh ... ? Sorry , off duty . But I got to get to ... You want to ride in the trunk ? Out ! Paulina . Paulina ! So what 's this all about ? I think I know what it is . Beer-ski . Are you all right ? Yes , I think so . I thought you were going to be - I - I had to do something . You 're not hurt , are you ? Paulina ! Gary , what are you doing here ? Are you following me ? No , I 'm not following you . I ... Paulina , hello . I am Chuck Fishniak . I am a manager of McGinty 's Restaurant . Uh , maybe you 've heard of it . But who is this ? Him ? I know not . Do I know you ? Yuri . Yuri Rosanova . It 's your father . Is this some kind of a joke ? Let me explain . No , let me explain . My father was a musician , not a cab driver . He died in Russia 15 years ago . Look , I - I know that 's what you believe , but the ... Believe ? ! I know it to be so . She 's right . I 'm sorry I lied to you . I may bear a resemblance of Rosanova , but the fact is I never even met the man . I 've never even been to Moscow . I just thought ... Well , anyway , I am ashamed of myself . I misled you , both of you . I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me . Never ... never . Paulina , w-wait . She 's not going to talk to you . Well , I 've got to talk to her . Well , then I 'd start with flowers . Here it is . Morris Hotel . You believe this guy 's story ? It sounds like something out of a Pushkin novel . I saw the picture . A picture , an old one . I mean , don 't you think she 'd know if he were her father ? Well , maybe she does . Uh , hello . Uh , Paulina Rosanova , please . One moment . Hello ? Hello , Paulina . Paulina ? Hello ? It 's good to see you still got the touch , kid . Listen , there 's got to be a reason for these headlines here . Yeah , it 's trying to tell you something . L - Like what ? Stay away from musicians . Remember Doctor Zhivago . Yeah ... What ? This is not like you , my friend . Victor . Something wrong ? Wrong ? W-What could be wrong , eh ? Everything is wonderful . This is America . And I am Yuri Rosanova , taxicab driver , invisible man . I see . I saw her today . I even spoke to her . And ? You were right . It was a mistake . I never should have tried . I 'm sorry . Hmm , life happens , huh , what can you do ? It 's like you always say - know where you stand , huh ? Trust your friends , no one else . And the concert today - what will you do ? I assume you won 't be going . No , no ... Very wise . It would only be painful . Well , if you like , you could give the ticket to me . The concert ticket . Oh , of course . But who would you give it to ? No one - I 'm going by myself . You ? But you hate music . Why on Earth would you want to ... But my daughter will be there . As will the ambassador . May I have it , please ? This is me . Your old friend . Would I let something happen to one of yours ? Trust me . It 's just business . No one will get hurt . That 's what you said 15 years ago . And now I am here . No , Victor . Not this time . I can make you , you know . With what , a gun ? A word to the authorities about your involvement in certain activities . It would break Paulina 's heart . Da ? Look , just let me get a bite to eat , will you ? What 's this ? Something big is happening , isn 't it ? Something big is happening . I got a front-page headline in Russian . Well , we know it has to do with one of two people . Yeah , well , the question is , which one and why ? All right , I 'll tell you what . Just this once , I 'm going to do this for you 'cause I think you 're cute . Yeah , thanks a lot , but I don 't need to know about pigs with melanoma or Spam . I need to know what this headline says . Maybe I can help you . Yuri ? They are going to kill him . Who ? The Russian ambassador , today at the consulate . Does he get one of these , too ? No ... what are you talking about ? I need your help . I 've done too much running away in my life . Too much being nobody to be somebody . Too busy thinking of how I failed instead of how I might succeed . Because of that , I lost my daughter . She is in danger . I could not bear to lose her again . Will you help me ? How are you going to do that ? It 's a consulate - you can 't just walk in . Oh , hold it . Who are you ? Uh , I 'm with the band . A substitute . What kind of substitute ? Uh , the , uh , bass guitar and , uh , tenor sax . Where 's your ticket ? Well , uh ... the reason I 'm substituting is the guy who usually plays got very sick and he puked all inside the case , and that 's where the ticket is , too . But if you want me to get it , I can show ... Next . Thank you . No wonder the whole country collapsed . Perfect day . It 's lovely . The ambassador has asked if he might sit nearby when you play . He 's entranced by your music . Miss Rosanova ? In Moscow , if one wanted to research old records , uh , locate reports , uh ... from local deaths , traffic accidents ... Why on Earth would you think of such a depressing thing ? Where would one start ? Better not to . In Moscow , what was not labeled " top secret " was most often thrown into boxes . Or used as fuel . What are you searching for ? Nothing important . It was just a thought . Paulina . It 's okay . Let him through . Thank you . Don 't mention it . Listen , something 's happened . Look , I 'm sure it has , but I 'm really not interested . I thought I made that quite clear . Wait . Then , why did you let me through ? Is it true ? Tell me it was just a hoax . Listen , what if I can 't do that ? Then my life has been a lie . What are you talking about ? Look , you share a God-given talent . How can that be wrong ? Because I believed in him . And you say my father abandoned me ? My father was not such a man . You were ten years old . How do you know ? He was brave and noble . And human . Brave and noble , they make mistakes . Maybe he was doing all he could . Is everything all right ? No , it 's not . Yes . Listen , Paulina ... Look , I 've said all I have to say . Miss Rosanova ? No , Paulina ... Paulina ! Pa ... ow . Hey . Where are you guys taking me , huh ? Hey , what 's wrong ? Don 't you speak English ? Thank you . On behalf of my country , I welcome each of yours . It is through cultural exchanges like this that we hope to forge a greater international understanding . I 'm sorry . These things are murder , aren 't they ? I don 't think so . Yeah , that 's easy for you to say . Where the hell is this guy ? Hey , listen , you guys . Wait , listen . Look ... Listen , Boris . Trouble-ski . Headline-ski , huh ? How am I supposed to read that ? It 's in Russian . And now , ladies and gentlemen , I give you Paulina Rosanova . What a wonderful greeting . Thank you . How long I have dreamt of this day , to play here in America . I feel both happy and sad . Happy to feel so free and sad for what I have learned . Sometimes , I guess it is easy to fool ourselves about who we are . Sometimes , it 's easier to pretend than to just be . Especially when we are young . I said I would play this violin today - the one that my father gave me - but I won 't . I no longer believe . No , you must believe . Papa ? Hey , he 's got a gun ! Perhaps , now we are even . Excuse me . You drop this ? Huh ? Oh , th ... hey . Can you tell me what this says ? " Hero Cab Driver Saves Violinist . " Hell , uh , I could have told you that . Paulina . Papa . Ahh ... Me , I never played the violin or the tenor sax . Got a drum set when I was 12 , but my dad put an end to that . I know this about music , though . Even though playing solo is okay , it always helps to have someone backing you up . As for falling in lust with a beautiful Russian virtuosas , well , that can be complicated . Especially for a corn-fed American boy . Maybe sometimes it 's safer to stick with the music you already know . On the other hand , when it comes to tomorrow 's newspaper , there 's a new tune every day . Oh , no . Chinese ? You got to be kidding me .

 Amen . Amen . Amen . Get the tape . Get it . It 's in the back . Come on ! It 's all right . You don 't have to do this . No , i want to . Why are you doing this ? Come . His name was isaac luria . He lived in the williamsburg section of brooklyn . Home to a sect of hasidic jews who 've lived there since the late 19th century . It 's an area also known for its history of racial tension and hate crimes ... yankel rosenbaum , tawana brawley ... and now isaac luria . He was murdered two days ago in the market that he owned . Severely beaten and shot five times at point-blank range . Police ruled out robbery ' cause the only thing that was missing was this videotape ... from the surveillance camera . Police found it early this morning . Where ? In the v.c.r. Of a 16 year old named tony oliver . That 's him on the upper right . Has he been arrested ? No , because he 's dead . Apparently he 'd been watching this tape when he was strangled to death . Very old testament . Yeah , but with a new twist . The brooklyn homicide detectives contacted the f.b.i. ' s civil rights branch ... with an interesting set of fingerprints that they pulled off of the boy 's body . - Interesting how ? - Interesting in that they belonged to isaac luria . Risen from the grave to avenge his own death ? Some people might assume that . It 's probably what someone would like us to think . - But you have your own idea . - I think that this is a crime of hatred , like the crime that spawned it . A hatred that goes back 4,000 years . But masquerading as something else here ... and a callow attempt at murderous retribution ... disguised as spectral justice . - A resurrection hoax ? - And not a very good one . Yeah . Spectral figures are not often known to leave fingerprints . Casper never did . Somehow the killer got a hold of isaac luria 's fingerprints . And we have been asked to prove how . Excuse me , sir . We 're with the f.b.i. We 'd like to speak with ariel luria . Is she home ? I 'm ariel 's father , jacob weiss . Why are you bothering her again ? She 's already spoken with the police . It 's all right . Let them in . Please , come in . Thank you . We can talk in the study . This is why you are here ? This is what you come to ask in this house of mourning ? What is this ? We would like your permission to reopen isaac 's grave . No ! The answer 's no ! Why does this have to be done ? We 're looking for evidence in the murder of this young man . His name is tony oliver . He is one of three suspects in the murder of your husband . We believe it was an attack of retaliation and that the other two suspects are targets . - He 's just a boy . - He 's an animal . A monster , just like the others who killed isaac ... whose grave you 're asking us to desecrate so you can now protect them . - Tata , please . - But where were you when isaac needed your protection ? When we called the police , they said that we were paranoid . That there was nothing to worry about . They always say that when someone threatens the jews . So there was a specific threat of violence ? The threat is always there . Just this morning ... this is what i found under our door . And now you 've come here not to help us , but to ask our help so you can impose your justice ... on the only man who 's taken justice into his own hands . We would be happy not to disturb the grave site if you could tell us who that man is . Even if i knew , why would i tell you ? Because this is a homicide investigation , sir , and you are required by law to assist us . I know all about your laws . Sir , i 'm afraid that even without your consent , we can get a court order to exhume isaac 's grave . Do what you feel is necessary . But leave us alone . Let us mourn in peace . I have a feeling he knows who killed tony oliver , mulder . I think he doesn 't want us disturbing luria 's grave because he knows what we 'll find . Maybe . But it 's hard to fault his attitude when you see something like that . And anybody delivering justice to a people who have known that kind of persecution and hatred , why wouldn 't they protect them ? Justice or revenge ? I 'm not saying those kids don 't warrant full prosecution under the law , but the hate mongering goes both ways . But the right to free expression doesn 't extend to murder . I bet whoever published that knows the boys who killed isaac luria , and probably has a good idea who killed tony oliver too . Sure i knew him . The man owned the store right across the street . But i 'd be lying if i said i was surprised it happened . Why is that ? Well , you know how they are . They 're always trying to find ways to make money off of honest folk who work for a living . Can you think of anyone who might have held a grudge ? I can 't think of anyone who didn 't . Did you ? Why ? I 'm not under any kind of suspicion , am i ? No , not directly , but these young men are . We have reason to believe you know them . Their names are derek banks and clinton macguire . I 'm sorry . I 'm not familiar with them . Well , are you familiar with this ? We think those kids are familiar with it . Enough to incite them to the murder of isaac luria . - You work for them too , don 't you ? - Who ? You know who . You look like you might be one yourself . We work for the f.b.i. , sir . Who 's the f.b.i. Work for ? That 's right . You call me paranoid , ' cause that 's exactly what they want you to do . But there is one thing you can 't call me and that is a zionist collaborator . You take a long look at these photos . It may be your last chance to save their lives . One of their accomplices , a young man named tony oliver was found murdered this morning . Why are you telling me this ? You haven 't heard the rumors ? What rumors ? That luria is back from the dead . That he 's risen from his grave . What kind of jew trick is this ? A jew pulled it off 2,000 years ago . We 're just relating the evidence , sir . You can draw your own conclusions . But i know you wouldn 't want to be responsible for ... endangering these young men 's lives . Bless you . Derek ? Are you sure about this ? I heard them , man . I 'm not waiting around to find out if it 's true . - damn ! - What 's wrong ? - It 's nailed shut . - There 's some tools in the trunk . I got it open , man ! Get down here . Hey , clinton . Check it out . Clinton . Hey , clinton . Check it out . Clinton ? You trying to mess with me ? Oh , man . The ligature marks on the victim 's neck are consistent with our vigilante 's m.o. Forensics come up with anything ? Yeah , a second set of footprints , but the mud was too soft to take a mold . My guess is clinton was here with derek banks . Looking for what ? Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse as retribution for tony oliver 's death . That seems pretty redundant , doesn 't it ? Messing up somebody you 've already killed ? I think they came here because they were afraid . Afraid ? Afraid that the man they hated enough to kill wasn 't really dead . Look . There goes your theory of how luria 's fingerprints found their way onto the victim 's body . What does that look like to you ? Well , the body wasn 't embalmed , as according to custom . Maybe it 's postmortem lividity or some kind of tattooing . It 's hard to tell at this stage of decomposition . What 's this ? A little bedtime reading ? You owe me for two weeks . Where have you been ? Is it true ? You and your friends killed the jew ? Just give me my money . What the hell were you thinking ? I never told you to kill anyone . I never said to do that . No ? What did you expect me to do ? Hide back here like you , licking envelopes in the dark , calling them names ? We 're working to spread the truth . The truth ? Man , you 're as pathetic as they are . What ? I am exposing their lies . Man , those are just words . You think they killed my friends with words ? That 's right . Clinton 's dead too . Now i 'd like my money . It 's called the sefer yezirah , the book of creation . The earliest known hebrew text on man 's mystical communion with the divine . Is it ever buried with the dead ? No . In observance with jewish belief that with death comes equality , the corpse is buried only in its shroud . No personal symbols of class or worldly position are allowed . Has it ever been known to spontaneously combust ? Uh , no . No , it hasn 't . It 's a book on mysticism , not mysticism itself . Is it printed on any special paper or with any special ink ? No , it 's just a book . Leather and paper . Now , i suspect somebody might be trying to play a trick on you . There is a possibility that moisture may have leeched into the coffin , into the binding and the pages of the book . If the groundwater was contaminated , arsenic or arsine gas could have created a combustible mixture . Is there anything that distinguishes this particular sefer yezirah from other books ? Yes , but it 's barely legible because of the burning . It 's a name engraved in the leather , or stamped into the leather . - A name ? - Yes , a hebrew name . Weiss . Jacob weiss . Jacob weiss . Why do you want to see him ? There 's been another murder . Another suspect in your husband 's death has been found dead last night . - Where was this ? - It was next to your husband 's grave . How does this concern my father ? Yesterday he expressed some strong feelings towards this latest victim . He was angry . They were just angry words . And we found evidence placing him at the crime scene . This is escalating into something else , ariel . Something that has to stop . My marriage to isaac , you have to understand how much it would have meant to my father . What do you mean , " would have meant " ? We got our marriage license a few weeks ago , but the wedding wasn 't until today . I 'm sorry . I 'd like to show you something . It was a communal wedding ring made in kolin , a village near prague . My father was an apprentice to the man who designed it . It 's beautiful . Mm-hmm . Every woman who got married in the synagogue wore this ring as a symbol that ... she was a queen , her husband a king , and the home they made a castle , not only on their wedding day , but for the rest of their lives together . But most of those lives ended in one day in the spring of 1943 . Nine thousand jews were massacred after digging their own graves . But your father survived . Because he was ten years old and he was a jeweler 's apprentice . He had small fingers to make bullets at a munitions factory . And through all this he hid the ring ? Even after the war , he hid it . Even from my mother . Why ? Because to him it was a dead relic from a forgotten place , until the day that i told him i was getting married . And for the first time in 50 years , he took out this ring . He said he felt his village was born again . He knew how much i loved isaac . Ariel , tell us where your father is . I know my father . He would never kill anyone . What if you 're wrong ? Do you see him ? I 'm sorry . We don 't mean any disrespect . Who are you ? We 're with the f.b.i. We 're looking for jacob weiss . Why ? Mulder . Don 't move ! Federal agent ! - You okay , mulder ? - Yeah . Put your hands in the air where i can see them . And turn around slowly . We got him , scully . Mr. Weiss , we 're placing you under arrest . Come on . Let 's go . Where is he ? Where 's my father ? We 've arrested him , ariel , under suspicion of murder . I don 't believe you . It can 't be him . Did he ... did he tell you he killed this person ? I think that 's the direction it 's going . Agent mulder 's in there with him right now . I need to see him . Ariel , i suggest that you get him an attorney . He 's refusing legal representation . I need to see him . Okay . You can ask detective bartley down the hall . He 'll give you a place to wait until your father 's been processed . Ariel . I 'm sorry . Why 'd you kill him , jacob ? Our synagogue has been vandalized 13 times in the last year . I heard a noise in the attic . I went up to see what it was and he attacked me . It was self-defense . Hanging a man in self-defense ? Is it any worse than what they did to isaac ? Is it any better ? They found your book , your sefer yezirah in isaac luria 's grave . So ? So that puts you at a second crime scene . I 'm guilty . What more do you want from me ? The truth . I have given you the truth . There was someone else in that attic with you . Who was it ? There was no one else . Then you 're a liar . And you know nothing about nothing . And i have no more to say about this . I would like to see my daughter . You wanna see the background check i ran on him ? He emigrated to israel after world war ii where he joined the irgun ... the jewish military underground . He was arrested in 1959 by the british for a bombing that killed seven civilians . He was a terrorist , mulder . A killer . He 's not our killer , though . What do you mean ? L ... he just gave a confession . I stood here and listened . I think there might have been a second person in that attic , scully . Weiss knows it too . And he 's protecting whoever it is . Well , who ? His daughter ? It was somebody big enough and strong enough to knock me down . - Well , who do you think it was ? You should stick around . This could be interesting . Where are you going ? To see a man about a burning book . They say you confessed . Why are you doing this ? To protect you . From what ? I think you know . They found my book in isaac 's grave . It can 't be true . No ? There 's something you didn 't tell me ... about the contents of this sefer yezirah . What is you want to know ? I want to know about the myth of thegolem . I told you , mr . Mulder . This is a mystical text . These pages are filled with golemsanddybbuksand demons of every size and shape . It 's thegolem that i 'm interested in . And i 'm interested in why an f.b.i. Agent would be so interested in such a thing . That 's what i was hoping you could tell me . The early kabbalists , they believed that a righteous man could actually ... create a living being from the earth itself . Fashioned from mud or clay . But this creature could only be brought to life by the power of the word . In-in-in practical terms , by the direct application of certain secret letter combinations . Combinations found in that book ? Look , look . See ? See ? These pages . They 're basically instructions ... for animating the inanimate . You see , and this ... yeah , and this passage here ... talks about inscribing a single word on thegolemitself . - On the back of his hand ? - I 'm impressed . - What is the magic word ? - Emet . See , these three letters , " alef , men , tav , " creates the wordemet . I don 't speak hebrew . I don 't know what that means . Truth . Emetmeans " truth . " But you see , mr . Mulder , therein lies the paradox . Because the danger of the truth is contained in the word " golem " itself , which means " matter without form , body without soul . " So thegolemis an imperfect creation . A kind of monster , really . Unable to speak or feel anything ... but the most primitive emotions . In the legends , it runs amok ... and has to be destroyed by its creator . Destroyed how ? By erasing the first letter , " alef , " " emet " becomes " met , " which means " dead . " Again , mr . Mulder , the power of letters . Not just to create , but to kill . Yeah ? Mulder , it 's me . There 's been another homicide . - Who ? - Curt brunjes . I 'm on my way to the print shop right now . Okay , i can be there in ten minutes . He was a man on a mission . Look at all the energy he spent spreading his hatred . He certainly wasn 't toiling in obscurity . This mailing list has hundreds of names , including our three murder victims . At least we know jacob weiss didn 't kill them . Yeah , i 'll call the precinct and have him released . Agent scully ? The image is fuzzy , but i think we 've got a hit . - There . - Oh , my god . It 's isaac luria . He 's still alive . I 'm not so sure about that . No , thank you . That won 't be necessary . Well , the coroner matched luria 's dental records . It was definitely his corpse that was in that grave . You know , mulder , this videotape , it must have been altered somehow . Planted by whoever is staging this hoax . It 's not a hoax , scully . It never was . But if luria is dead , mulder ... this is not luria . Not really . Well , who do you think it is ? Do you think it 's some kind of a ghost ? No , a ghost is spirit without form . But i believe what we 're looking for and what we 're seeing here is form without spirit . Something called agolem . Agolem ? Yeah , it 's ... it 's a kind of a manmade monster described in jewish folklore . It 's fashioned from mud , and then animated through mystical incantation . Mud ? Mulder , what are you talking about ? And for what purpose ? Exacting revenge ? I don 't think it was hate that created thisgolem , scully . I think it was love . Ariel , it 's agent mulder . Open the door . It 's not locked . Ariel ? She 's not here , scully . How do you know ? 'Cause it 's her wedding day . Ariel ? I know you 're here . I know you can hear me . Ariel ? Leave us alone , tata . You don 't belong here . - I 'm your father . - Please go . Not without you . I 'm not leaving without you . I want to see him . He 's dead . Isaac is dead . No . The boys that killed him , their hate took him from you , and you tried bringing him back with your love . But what you brought back ... you have to understand , ariel , it isn 't him . It 's an abomination . It has no place among the living . He said he 'd call me back , tata . We were talking on the phone ... about the wedding . Isaac said he had to go . That a customer needed him , and that he would call me back . But when i heard the phone ring later , something told me not to pick it up . A woman 's voice was on the line . I didn 't hear what she was saying . I didn 't have to . I knew isaac wasn 't calling me back . I was just wanted to say good-bye , tata . I know . I know . I didn 't think ... it was just a wish . They were just ... words . Stay here . I want to go with you . No . No ! Tata . Wait , i got a knife . His pulse is thready . Will he be all right ? If we get him to a hospital . Call the paramedics . - Where are you going ? - To find ariel . Ariel ? We found your father . He 's alive . He 's gonna be okay . I know about isaac . Where is he ? I don 't know . Okay . All right , come on . We 've got to get out of here . No . Come on , ariel . Let 's go . No . We have to go . No . Come on , ariel . Come on . Isaac ? - Stop or i 'll fire ! - No ! No ! No ! Stop ! No . Isaac . I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me . I loved you . Mulder ? Are you okay ? I heard shots fired . What happened ? - What is she doing ? - Saying good-bye . I made this .

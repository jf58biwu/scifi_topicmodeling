 HEY ! Hey ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's all right . I 'm not going to hurt you . What do you want ? I thought you were ... What ? I don 't know . Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Stop ! What ? What ... ? It 's okay . Come here . It 's okay . Calm down . Everything 's gonna be fine . What was in there ? Just give me a minute to figure things out . Why were you afraid of that room ? Give me a minute , i said . How many people are in this thing ? Listen , we can 't go climbing around in here . Why not ? There 's traps . What do you mean , traps ? Man : booby-Traps . I looked in the room down there And something almost cut my head off . Woman : holy cats ! Holy , holy cats ! Are you all right ? Mister ? Worth ! Don 't worry . I hit my head . Let me take a look at that . It 's okay . I 'm a doctor . Woman : it doesn 't look bad . What the hell are you doing ? Hey , old man , Did you hear what i said ? Motion detectors integrated into the walls . Tough to spot . Girl : oh , god ! Oh , god . Oh , god . Wait a second . Let 's all just relax for a minute . Does anybody remember how they got here ? Perogies ! I was eating dinner . Perogies ; cheese and potato . I ran out of sour cream , And then i went to the fridge , and then ... I don 't know . You ? Leaven ? I ... I just went to bed and ... What about you ? I just woke up here . Middle of the night . It 's like chile . They always come in the middle of the night . Who ? Woman : only the government could build something this ugly . Quentin : oh , it ain 't government . Woman : then what is it ? I don 't know . Aliens . Please . We 're spooked enough as it is . Let 's ... Let 's rule out aliens for now , And concentrate on what we know . My mom 's gonna freak . Rennes ? I just won 't be there . They 'll freak . What do you think , rennes ? Well , it won 't solve jack shit sitting still . I 'm moving in a straight line till i get to the end . All right . I tend to agree . Leaven : shouldn 't we wait here ? For what ? To see if anybody comes . No one 's gonna come . Look , there 's away in here . So there 's gotta be away out . We can avoid the traps using the boot . Quentin : holloway , is it ? What do you think ? Look for an exit ? Okay . What about you ? It can 't be that simple . Rennes : it won 't be that simple . Look around . Take a good , long look-See . 'Cause i got a feeling it 's looking at us . I just wanna wake up . Leaven . We can do this . We just have to stay calm , And work together as a team . There 's gonna be a lot of people Looking for us on the outside . I 'm a cop . All right ? You 're a cop ? Yeah . Quentin : i 'm going to get you out of here . I promise . You gotta be with me on this one . Okay . Okay ? Boot it . Clean . Holloway : that one sounded closer . It 's mechanical . Seems to come at regular intervals . Quentin : maybe it 's their ventilation system . Rennes : no vents . Holloway : no kidding . I 'm boiling . Quentin : what is it ? Serial numbers ? Holloway : room numbers . They 're different in each room . Worth : oh , great . Well , it 's only , uh , 566 million , 400,000 odd rooms in this thing . Well , there better not be . We have about three days without food and water Before we 're too weak to move . Well , they have to feed us , don 't they ? Holloway ? Oh , we have heat , stress , Physical exertion , i.E. Dehydration . Headaches , dizziness , confused mental processes . The body eventually begins to break down its own tissue . Suck on it . Keeps the saliva flowing . What ? The air seems dry in there . Holloway : trapped ? Molecular-Chemical sensor . Why the hell didn 't the boot set it off ? Rennes : the boot 's not alive . It detects hydrogen sulphide excreted from the skin . How is it you know so much about sensors , rennes ? Renne , not rennes . It 's french . Fine , you 're french . I 'm asking how ... [ Click of release ] renne ! Quentin : sensor expert . About the right age . I don 't believe it . This guy 's " the wren " . The what ? He 's " the wren " . The bird of attica . Flew the coop out of six major prisons . Seven . Holloway : you 're kidding , right ? You can get us out ? Maybe . An escape artist . Yeah , harry fucking houdini . The only reason i dragged you this far is ' cause i need your boots . If you don 't smarten up , i 'm gone like that . No more talking , No more guessing , Don 't even think about nothing that 's not right in front of ya . That 's the real challenge . You gotta save yourselves from yourselves . [ Click of release ] merde ! Get him out ! Oh , my god . Quentin : so , it was electro - Chemical or whatever , right ? And he missed it . " The wren " . That 's great . That 's fucking great . All right . It 's time to reassess this place . I 've been over it again and again . Why would they throw innocent people in here ? Are we being punished ? I have never done any - Thing to deserve this . Forget about all that . You can 't see the big picture from in here , so don 't try . Keep your head down . Keep it simple . Just ... Just look at what 's in front of you . That 's what he said . Quentin : start with us . We got an escape artist and a cop . There 's gotta be a reason for that . You 're a doctor , holloway . That gives you a function , a reason , right ? No , it just makes me go , " why me , And not one of the other 10 million doctors out there ? " [ Sigh of frustration ] Leaven ? What are you ? Nothing . I just go to school . I hang out with my friends . What else ? There is nothing else . My parents are these people . I live with them . I 'm boring . I think We have to ask the big questions . What does it want ? What is it thinking ? One down , four to go . Why don 't you tell us what your purpose is , worth ? Often wondered that myself . I 'm just a guy . I work in an office building , doing office building stuff . I wasn 't exactly bursting with joie de vivre before i got here . Life just sucks in general . Oh , i can 't stand that attitude . Because he 's right ? What 's your purpose , quentin ? Kids . Three of them . I haven 't made my peace yet . But i 'm getting outta here no matter what . That 's where my strength comes from . You people find yours wherever you got it . For christ 's sake , worth , what do you live for ? Don 't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something ? Nope . But i 've got a pretty fine collection of pornography . Holloway : how nice ! Nice ! I haven 't got anybody either , but i 'm not giving up . I am pissed off . They came into our homes . They stripped us bare . They took my rings . They took ... oh , my amethyst . I want to know who 's responsible . Quentin : leaven . Your glasses . You don 't need them . They 're for reading . Well , they took off her jewellery , but they must have ... Put these on you . If nothing 's random , Why are they here ? Quentin : leaven , what do you do in school ? Math ! What can they mean ? Sssh ! 149 . Leaven : prime numbers . I can 't believe i didn 't see it before . Quentin : see what ? It seems like if any of these numbers are prime , Then the room is trapped . Okay , um , 645 . 645 . That 's not prime . 372 . No . 649 . Right . 11 times 59 . It 's not prime either . So that room is safe . Wait , wait , wait . How can you make that assumption Based on one prime number trap ? I 'm not . The incinerator thing was prime . 83 . The molecular-Chemical thingy had 137 . The acid room had 149 . You remember all that in your head ? I have a facility for it . Quentin : leaven . You beautiful brain . Boot it . Okay , out of the way . Leaven : brains before beauty . Safe ! [ Gasp of relief ] Safe ! Prime numbers ! Prime numbers ! Prime numbers . Prime numbers . Prime numbers ... Leaven : how long have we been in here ? Quentin : nine or ten hours . Leaven : how do you know ? Quentin : 5 : 00 o 'clock shadow . Last thing i remember was shaving . Leaven : i guess i missed breakfast . Or lunch . Or whatever . Quentin : well , don 't worry . I 'll have you home in time for dinner . Leaven : if we get out , I 'll make you dinner . Quentin : you 've got a date . Doing good . I need to smoke . I 'd smoke a butt off the sidewalk . Holloway , Just reel yourself in a bit . Come on . We 're moving along . Things are looking up . Okay , okay , you 're right . I quit smoking years ago . [ Harsh breath ] i just need to be occupied . Quentin : talk then . Have a conversation . What kind of doctor are you anyway ? Uh , oh you know , i 'm the free kind . Okay , chit-Chat . Chit-Chat . Um ... Um , come on , help me . Uh , tell me about your rug-Rats . Okay . We have three boys . Nine , seven and five . Oh , good god ! The poor woman . There 's no way i 'd survive that . Yeah . She didn 't either . No , she 's not dead . She ... We 're just separated . Uh , i 'm sorry . I can 't just shoot the breeze . These numbers aren 't prime . Okay . Clear . Excuse me . Sorry . You , uh , could try and help me out here , buddy . No i couldn 't . This one 's trapped too . We have to backtrack ? Not yet . Holloway : oh , no . Read them to me . Holloway : what are you ? His coat rack ? Leaven : look , please . It 's stuck . Man : [ wailing ] Leaven : look out ! This room is green . Holloway . Hl , there . This room is green . Holloway : yes , it is . I wanna go back to the blue room . What is it ? Shock or what ? I think he 's mentally handicapped . I like the blue room . Jesus christ ! He almost broke my neck . Hey , there , are you all alone ? Do you want to hold my hand , honey ? Butter first , Then honey , kazan . Butter first , then honey ... How 'd he survive ? Kazan : i want to go back to the blue room . There 's lots of blue rooms . We 'll find you another one real soon . Leaven : this is just way too bizarre . Well you just worry about your numbers then . Go on . I 'll look after him . Safe , obviously , Since he almost fell on my head . Holloway : should we go for a walk ? Kazan ? You want to go for a walk ? Holloway : um , quentin ? Kazan : [ wailing ] Let 's not make him do the climbing thing right away . Holloway ! Holloway . Holloway : could they have taken us all the way to new mexico ? Quentin : what are you talking about , holloway ? Holloway : i 'm talking about where do you hide something this big ? At least he 's good for something . Hey , i 'm sorry to shake your foundations , quentin , But you have no idea where your tax dollars go . Free clinic doctors . Holloway : only the military - Industrial complex Could afford to build something this size . Holloway ? What is the military industrial complex ? Have you ever been there ? I 'm telling you , it 's not that complex . How would you know from where you are ? Who do you think the establishment is ? [ Snort ] it 's just guys like me . Their desks are bigger but their jobs aren 't . They don 't conspire . They buy boats . Quentin : no , this place is ... Remember scaramanga ? The bad guy in " the man with the golden gun " . Yeah ? It 's some rich psycho 's entertainment . Is that what you think ? Clear ! Okay . You 're a cop . Single bullet theory . Right on ! Gas ! Holloway ! Get back here . Holloway : it 's okay . I just swallowed my button . Leaven : i hate this ! Your boy 's having a conniption fit in there . It 's like cramming without coffee . She needs a break . She can do it . They all look prime to me . That your two-Bits worth , Worth ? For what it 's worth . Well ? Well , he 's right . They 're not prime . Leaven : stop ! In front of you . What is it ? [ Wailing ] Ow ! Ow ! Shut up ! I don 't know what happened . It wasn 't prime . Quentin , hold still . Somebody stop that racket . Worth ! Leave the boots . And shut the fucking door . I had a feeling about that fucking guy . He knew about that trap . But these numbers aren 't prime . Then your number system failed . But he knew . Knew what ? How would he know ? You 're the paranoid one . Think about it . His only function so far has been to kick us when we 're down . So he has a bad attitude . Are you saying that makes him a spy ? Trust me on this . It 's my job to read people like an x-Ray . [ Whimpering ] he doesn 't like red rooms . [ Sigh ] so what happened ? You saw what happened . Quentin . I guess the numbers are more complicated than i thought . Maybe they mean nothing at all . Leaven : no , it means they 're more involved . They 've worked for us up till now , haven 't they ? I just need some more time with them . Well , we need to rest anyway . Well , that 's handy , 'Cause there 's not a fuck of a lot else we can do . Are they telling you anything ? They 're not tarot cards . [ Sigh ] do you have any idea How many variables i have to consider Before i can decipher numbers this size ? They don 't reveal themselves right away . They 're like people . Leaven : oh , gross ! Oh , not here , honey . Over in the corner . Well , he 's just peeing . Jesus christ ! That 's excellent . Now it totally reeks in here . You find this all pretty funny , don 't you ? What 's your fucking problem , worth ? Even holloway 's holding up better than you . Get over there and help her with him . That 's your job : Babysitter . Ja 'wohl , kommandant . Somebody has to take responsibility around here . And that somebody has to be you . Not all of us have the luxury of playing nihilist . Not all of us are conceited enough to play hero . His is a will to live . Everybody 's got it , worth , even you . Especially you , hiding behind that cynical front . A will to live . That 's the warm , cosy feeling deep inside ? Thanks , quentin , i 'm a new man . Oh ! Poor worth ! Nobody loves me . If that 's the chip on your shoulder , Why didn 't you just lie down and die ? Do it . Show us you have some backbone , and jump in the sushi machine . Be a man . Thought so . Fuck you , quentin . I don 't wanna die . I 'm just being realistic . You think they 'd go to all this trouble if we could just walk out ? They would have left us clues and let us beat it so far , If there wasn 't a way out ? You think we matter ? We don 't . Ah , put us out of your misery , so we can get out of here . - You 're not getting out of here . - Yes , we are . No , you 're not . Yes , we are . There is no way out of here . Quentin : gotcha . How ... Do you know that ? Answer the question , worth . Oh , god ! Who are you ? I 'm the poisoner . I designed the outer shell . What ? The shell of the sarcophagus . You built this thing ? Not this part , the exterior . I ... i don 't know anything about the numbers Or anything else in here . I was contracted to draw up plans for a hollow shell . A cube . Leaven : a cube ? Why didn 't you tell us ? For god 's sakes , worth , You knew what it was . No . Worth . You 're lying . It 's not a first . Holloway : who 's behind it ? I dunno . Who hired you ? I didn 't ask . [ Snort ] i never even left my office . I talked to them on the phone ; other guys like me , Specialists working on ... on small details . Nobody knew what it was . Nobody cared . Bull shit ! You knew from square one . Look at him . He 's up to his eyeballs in this thing . No , quentin . That 's how they stay hidden . You keep everyone separated , So the left hand doesn 't know what the right hand is doing . The brain never comes out in the open . Whose brain ? It 's all the same machine , right ? The pentagon , multi - National corporations , The police ! If you do one little job , You build a widget in saskatoon , And the next thing you know , It 's two miles under the desert , The essential component of a death machine . I was right . All along , my whole life , i knew it . I told you , quentin . Nobody 's ever going to call me paranoid again . We 've got to get out of here and blow the lid off this thing . Holloway , you don 't get it . Then help me please . I need to know . This may be hard for you to understand , But there is no conspiracy . Nobody is in charge . It ... it 's a headless blunder Operating under the illusion of a master plan . Can you grasp that ? Big brother is not watching you . What kind of fucking explanation is that ? It 's the best you 're gonna get . I looked , and the only conclusion i could come to Is that there is nobody up there . Somebody had to say , " yes , " to this thing . - What thing ? - Only we know what it is . We have no idea what it is . We know more than anybody else . I mean , somebody might have known sometime before they got- - They got fired or voted out or sold it . But if this place ever had a purpose , Then it got miscommunicated or ... or ... Or lost in the shuffle . I mean , this is an accident ; A ... a forgotten perpetual public works project . Do you think anybody wants to ask questions ? All they want is a ... is a clear conscience and a fat pay check . I mean , i leaned on my shovel for months on this one . This was a great job . Why put people in it ? Because it 's here . You have to use it , or you admit it 's pointless . But it ... it is pointless . Quentin , that 's my point . What have we come to ? It 's so much worse than i thought . Not really . Just more pathetic . You make me sick , worth . I make me sick too . We 're both part of the system . I drew a box . You walk a beat . It 's like you said , quentin . Just keep your head down , keep it simple , Just look at what 's in front of you . Nobody wants to see the big picture . Life 's too complicated . I mean , let 's face it , The reason we 're here Is that it 's outta control . This is how we ruin the world ? Leaven : well , duh ! Have you been on glue all your lives ? I felt guilty for ruining the world since i was like seven . God ! If you need someone to blame , throw a rock . Well , i feel better . That 's why you stayed with us . To confess . Still looking for someone to bust , quentin ? Leaven : quentin , stop it ! Stop it ! We need him . What for ? Have you gone absolutely mad ? He 's the only one who knows anything about the place . Worth . H-Hi . So there 's this outer shell ? Yeah . And it 's a cube , right ? Like this ? I assume so . Are there any doors ? There 's one door . Where ? Where the door guy put it . Worth : six guesses and it 's sealed from the outside . And what are the dimensions of the outer shell ? 434 feet square . May i ? Come on , honey , Slide over . [ Sigh ] 14 by 14 by 14 . The inner cube can 't be flush to the shell wall . I know that . There 's a space . One cube ? I don 't know . It makes sense . Okay , well ... The biggest that the cube can be then Is 26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so ... 17,576 rooms . 17,576 rooms ? Oh , god . That makes me queasy . Descartes . Leaven , you are a genius . What ? What ? Leaven : cartesian coordinates . Of course . Coded cartesian coordinates . They 're used in geometry to plot points On a three-Dimensional graph . In english ? Slower . I 'm sure these numbers are markers . A grid reference like ... latitude and longitude on a map . The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube . Well , where are we ? It works ! Okay , um , All we have to do is add the numbers together . X-Coordinate is 19 , Y is ... 26 rooms . So that places us ... Seven rooms from the edge . All right . Let 's go . Just out of curiosity , I mean , don 't hit me again or anything , But what are you going to do when you get there ? Maybe we can get the door open . Oh . What we need to do is figure out How to get around the traps . I 'm dealing with that , holloway . I 'm looking for practical solutions here . Well , you haven 't found any yet . We 'll cut the risk , With the numbers and the boot . Worth will go in first . Holloway : no , he won 't , quentin . We take turns . Relax . Quentin : room for two in there ? What 's the matter ? These coordinates ; 14 , 27 , 14 . What about ' em ? Well , they don 't make sense . Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across , There can 't be a coordinate larger than 26 . If this were right , then we would be outside of the cube . No , not outside of the cube . Oh . Guess that means we 're not having dinner . Kazan : trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap . Trap ! [ Rush of movement ] Trap ! [ Rush of movement ] Sound activated . Boo ! [ Rush of movement ] Lovely . How come the sound of the door opening didn 't set it off ? Must be rigged to ignore it . Holloway : so that 's it ? The edge is surrounded by traps . Well , i guess we have to backtrack , And try somewhere else . Quentin : who knows how many detours we 'll have to take . I say we cross the bitch . Right ! ? How many boots do we have left , holloway ? Quentin : get it off him . We know how it works . We just have to be quiet . That 's pretty fucking quiet . Quentin : i 'm glad you 're on his side , worth , 'Cause you 're up . And he 's not coming . Of course he is . No way ! You 're not leaving him behind . He 's unpredictable . When we get to the edge we can come back for him , But he 'll get some - Body killed here . Am i right ? Holloway : shame on you . Will you look at yourselves ? What have you turned into ? They may have taken our lives away , But we 're still human beings . That 's all we 've got left . We 'll come back for him . That 's a lie and you know it . He 'll be quiet . Ha ! [ Rush of movement ] You fucking fuck ! All right . That 's enough ! He 's a trap ! Let him go right now . The law of the jungle , holloway , he 's endangering the pack . Let him go , you nazi ! What did you call me ? Quentin , you let that innocent boy go . You listen to me , woman . Every day i mop up after your bleeding heart . The only reason you even exist Is because i keep you . [ Whispering ] i know your type . No kids . No man to fuck you . So you go around outraged , Sticking your nose up other people 's assholes , Sniffing their business . Quentin : you missed your boat , holloway . You 're all dried up inside there , aren 't you ? That 's your fucking problem . How dare you say that to her ? You don 't know her , quentin . None of us know each other here . Oh ... i do . No , you don 't ! No wonder your wife left you . All that bottled up anger . And a thing for young girls . Holloway : [ yelp of pain ] God help you , quentin . Huh ! Did you smack your kids around too ? Is anybody besides me Interested in what 's on the other side of that door ? Open it . Door number six , not number one , Door number two ? Open the fucking thing . [ Whispering ] sunshine . Night time . Worth : my old friend the shell . It 's there . [ Echoes ] morning . Morning . Morning . Morning ... Quentin : hang on to me . Can 't see shit . Nothing to hang on to . We gotta try something . We gotta see if the door 's over there . Someone has to swing over there and take a look . Worth : swing ? Quentin : we make a rope ... Out of clothes . Take ' em off . I 'll tie it around myself . Oh , yeah , you 're gonna go . You weigh like 500 pounds . It 'll snap in two seconds . I 'm the lightest . Forget it . I 'll go . I 'm going , holloway . She 's right , quentin , you 're too heavy . I 'm the lightest after leaven . Anyways , it 's my turn . How long did you know People were being put in here ? A couple of months . That 's not long , If you consider your whole life . [ Snort ] i am . You opened my eyes , worth . That 's something . David . Helen . You 're such a helen . That 's as far as you go . Holloway : there 's nothing down here . Hold tight . I 'll try swinging over there . Brace yourselves . I 'm going to try again . [ Gasp ] okay . One more time . Worth : hurry ! You 're getting heavy . What the hell 's going on ? Quentin : get up here now . Worth : quentin ! Leaven : have you got her ? Worth : what 's going on ? Leaven : quentin ? Is she okay ? She , uh ... Slipped . Kazan : holloway ? Worth : hush . Come on , kazan . Kazan , will you please stop doing that ? Leaven . You gotta be strong , sweetheart . Don 't even talk to me . We gotta get down to the bottom . It 'll be easier to get on to the shell from there . It 's a long fucking way with only one boot , But we gotta do it before we get too weak . You gotta keep cracking the numbers , leaven . I can 't think any more . Sure you can . It 's your gift . It 's not a gift . It 's just a brain . Let her sleep for awhile . We haven 't slept in fuck knows how long . All right . One hour . How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is ? An hour is as long as i say . [ Sleepily ] what are you doing ? We have to make it down to the bottom . It 'll be quiet there and you can concentrate . You just wanna leave them ? They 're traps , leaven . We 're the key . I 'll get us down there . You 'll think us out . Believe in me . Try and see what i see ; How my mind works , The flash when i look into someone 's head , Like a fucking x-Ray . I looked through the walls . I dreamed him , At his desk , designing everything . Yeah . He can 't let you solve the puzzle , see ? 'Cause there is a purpose . We are the purpose . The cube ... Is us . Quentin ... we fit , Like numbers . A man and a woman ; Two halves of the equation . I 'll take you down ; The perfect key . I 'll slip you in the lock . Leaven . It 's time to go down . Getaway from her . Quentin : leaven . They 're fucking spies : Him , the retard . Holloway had outside information about my family . But she slipped up , didn 't she ? She crossed the line . You dropped her . Just go , quentin . Give us the boot , you pig . You don 't want the boot . Quentin : you want to come with us , worth ? Down the hatch . What the fuck 's with him ? How did he ... ? It 's ... it 's ... It 's " the wren " . The old wrenster . [ Giggling ] How could ... ? We 're going in circles . That can 't be . Where are we ? I don 't know . Where are we ? You figure it out . You haven 't done anything . All you did was freak out , you ... Murderer ! I guess you were right , worth . There is no way out of here . Getaway from me . Wasn 't rennes killed in that room ? How come there 's nothing out there ? It 's the edge . We weren 't at the edge before . Where 's the room that killed rennes ? Fuck off ! Oh , that was good . What difference does it make ? We 're dead anyways . Hey ! Listen to what i 'm saying . There was a room there before . We haven 't been moving in circles . The rooms have . Of course . The rooms . That explains the thunder and the shaking . We 've been shifting the whole time . It 's ... it 's the only logical explanation . I 'm such an idiot . What are you on to , leaven ? Give me a minute . Okay . The numbers are markers , Points on a map , right ? Right . And how do you map a point that keeps moving ? Permutations . Permu-What ? Permutations . A list of all the coordinates That the room passes through . Like a map that tells you where the room starts , How many times it moves , and where it moves to . A number tells you all that ? I don 't know . See , i 've only been looking at one point on the map , Which is probably the starting position . All i saw was what the cube looked like Before it started to move . Okay , so it 's moving . How do we get out ? 27 ! I know where the exit is . Where ? Stay away from me . Back off , quentin . I just want to know . Don 't you want to know ? You remember that room we passed through before ? The one with the coordinate larger than 26 ? What about it ? That coordinate placed the room Outside the cube . A bridge ! Right . But only in its original position . What are you talking about ? Uh ... Look . The room starts off as a bridge . And then it ... it moves its way through the maze , Which is where we ran into it . But at some point , It must return to its original position . So the bridge is only a bridge ... For a short period of time . This thing is like a giant combination lock . When the rooms are in their starting position , the lock is open . But when they move out of alignment , the lock closes . With a structure this size , it must take days For the rooms to complete a full cycle . So when does it open ? Don 't . To find the original coordinates , The numbers are added together to find the permutations , Then subtracted from one another . That 's it . This room moves to zero , one , And negative one on the x-Axis , Two , five and negative seven on y , And one , negative one and zero on z . What does that mean ? You suck at math . Okay , i need the room numbers around us as a reference point . Worth : six , six , six . Eight , nine , seven . Four , six , six . Five , six , seven . Eight , nine , eight . Okay ? Yes . And five , four , five . Did you get that ? Worth : six , five , six . Seven , seven , eight . Four , six , two . That 's enough . X is 17 , y is 25 , And z is 14 . Which means this room makes two more moves Before returning to its original position . Do we have time ? Maybe . Then let 's go . Can you work the traps for this system ? Fuck the traps . Let 's get to the bridge . Well you threw out our last boot , you fucking idiot . Technically i can identify the traps . Technically ? I thought they were identified by prime numbers , they 're not . They 're identified by numbers that are the power of a prime . Okay , so ? Can you calculate that ? The numbers are huge . But you can , right ? Yes , you can . I 'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set . Maybe if i had a computer ... You don 't need a computer . Yes , i do . Figure it out . I can 't ! I 'm not dying in a fucking rat maze . Look ! Nobody in the whole world could do it mentally . Look at the numbers : 567 , 898 , 545 . There 's no way i can factor that . I can 't even start on 567 . It 's astronomical . Kazan : two . Astronomical . What did you say ? Astronomical . Worth : before that . Factors ? How many factors , kazan ? Of 567 ? Two . What ? Are you fucking kidding ? Kazan , how many factors does 30 have ? Three . Leaven : how about seven ? One . Gum drop . I don 't have any gum drops . Kazan : gum drop . Kazan ? I 'll give you a whole box of gum drops for each answer . Gum drops come in bags . Okay , you want ' em in bags , you got ' em in bags . Kazan : i don 't like the red ones . Eight , nine , eight . Two . Five , four , five . Two . He 's giving us the factors . Astronomical .

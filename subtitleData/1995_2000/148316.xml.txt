 That 's right . Even then ... I didn 't kill him . It wasn 't my fault ! That 's right ... Even then ... You 're afraid of the ocean ? I nearly drowned when I was a kid . The adults thought I was playing and just stood on the shore , watching and laughing . What 's a guy like that doing on this project ? Because this thing will keep me from drowning . Go ? You are ? Yeah . I formally volunteered yesterday . You 're talking crazy ! Aren 't you interested ? He had money , fame , position . Why would such an important scientist start all this ? Aren 't you interested ? Know what this is ? A composite ... ? It was taken by a recon drone . That 's what 's inside the thick clouds our spy sats can 't peek through . So ... Wanna check it out ? You scared ? We 're transmitting the signal . They won 't kill us . That 's assuming Zorndyke 's in the mood to talk to us . He is . How do you know that ? ! Just because . Starboard high ! Something big ! That 's ... ! The Ghost Ship ! Leave it alone , Hayami ! We have no intention of attacking ! Katsuma ! Go on without me , Hayami ! God dammit ! He ignored our signal ! Never mind ! Just go ! Almost ... Almost got it ... ! I 'm fine ! Just go ! KATSUMA ! See you around , Hayami . I didn 't kill him . Smack in the middle of the Pacific . Helluva one-way ticket ... You ... You saved me ? You want me to eat this ? You sure ? Isn 't it a friend of yours ? We 're enemies , you know . You want to thank me ? All I do is get rescued . By Katsuma ... And also ... All I do is get rescued from the sea . Hey . Are you guys happy about this ? If this pole shift succeeds , we 'll lose our place to live . And then we 'll vanish from the Earth soon after . Then you guys will create a new world . A world of endless blue . A utopia covered by the waters of life . Are you happy about that ? Zorndyke rejects the world as it is . Does that mean we 're unhappy ? Maybe he wants nature to punish us for all the destruction we cause by pursuing our ambitions . No , that 's not right . He isn 't any sort of ecologist . And I don 't think he went nuts , either . Would he kill a billion people just for that ? So , why is Zorndyke ... ? Aren 't you interested ? Some good luck mixed in with the bad . Damage in the engine room 's light and our hull repairs should be completed soon . Out of 7 boats , 2 are heavily damaged and 1 moderately damaged . That 's not what I call good luck . But the operation 's begun . There 's no turning back now . You should rest . I 'm fine . Thinking about him ? You reap what you sow- - Stop it . We 're fighting to avenge a billion people . No , to let mankind keep on living ! There 's no room in that fight for an outsider who acts like a cowboy . Am I wrong ? ! I don 't think you 're wrong ... Then you 're going to have to forget about him ! He left while we were fighting ... Even if he survives , we 'd leave a bad taste in each other 's mouths . We 've sighted it ! Coordinates 22-1 6-00 . Right on target ! Confirmed . We 've arrived at the target point ! Picking up beacon ! So , we 're finally here . Yeah ... Our last card to play . An inheritance from the old days , huh ? Heh , an inheritance ? Nasty things to lose , don 't you think ? They 're nuclear-tipped , aren 't they ? SLBMs ... A Typhoon-class sub rigged as a giant torpedo carrying 20 SLBMs rigged for simultaneous ignition . The flashiest firecracker in the world . Send out the Grampus . Begin the operation ! That 's right . There 's no turning back now ... " Kill him , kill him " , huh ? The same ... It 's the same thing , all over again . Kill me . If it 'll make you happy , then do it . A billion people are already dead . One or two more won 't make much of a difference . What the ... ? This is ... A Musuca-class ... ? You saved her . You saved Mutio . What 's going on ? The women have returned to the sea . Now you must return to where you belong . That doesn 't exist anymore . The place I was born is on the bottom ofthe sea now . Where you belong exists neither on the land nor in the air . Are you saying ... ? ! Your companions still live . Isn 't the work finished yet ? 30 more minutes , Boss ! I want it done NOW ! Damn it all ... Um , uh ... Boss ? What is it ? ! We 're getting a signal from the Mutio . You know where the women went ? ! Well , uh ... After Blue Dome was destroyed it seems one of Blue 6 's crew was spared . WHAT ? ! Why did they save a human ? ! They 're the enemy ! The enemy we have to kill ! Well , yes sir , but ... Damned thieving cats ! They lie ! Kill ! Steal ! That 's what they 're really like ! Uh , cats , sir ... ? Idiot ! Onloading completed , Boss ! You 're sure of what we 've got ? Aye , sir . 13 cruise missiles , 6 torpedoes , 8 depth charges . All of them nuclear-armed . Excellent ... We 'll burn the humans to death with the unquenchable fire they created themselves ! What a show this will be ... But , Boss ... The order to destroy them hasn 't come ! Just SHUT UP ! Papa 's methods are too soft ! When it 's time to kill , you kill ! The humans see their chance . They 'll be advancing into our territory soon . Kill them ! Annihilate them all ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! Kill ! We were born beneath the thick ice of the Antarctic . Inside the culture tanks . We were to wander the seven seas and destroy human cities . That was our purpose . But , one day , a question arose among my kind . Why did Papa grant us sentience ? How much of the Manyoshu have you learned so far ? " ' Today , today ! ' Each day I have waited for you ... " " ... and now do they not say you are strewn with the shells of Ishi River ? " I 'll be finished with the Chronicle of Garia soon . Wonderful . Good girl . Brother Verg is so late ... Yes . Troublesome boy ... I hope nothing bad will happen to him . Why did he ? Aren 't you interested , human ? Because he 's testing us ? I am not nearly so arrogant as that . Those who walk on the land and those who swim in the sea . Two life-forms , set to kill each other . He won 't be the one who decides this . Will it be us who decide ? Isn 't that right , Katsuma ? I 'm interested myself , now . About this man called Zorndyke ... Seabed rise . Range : 2000 ! Engines , one-half . Left rudder , 25 degrees . This is like trick riding . Overhead out cropping . Range : 600 ! It 's not on the charts ! Engines , slow ! Left rudder , 8 degrees ! Up trim , 12 ! No ! 14 degrees ! This is nuts ! We 'll never make it through ! Down trim , 15 degrees ! Aye , aye ! There 's no better guide for us than him . This is the path he took to make peace with Zorndyke . Every nook and cranny is etched into his memory . A path to peace , huh ? And now it 's being used as our last chance to destroy him . Ironic , isn 't it ? Up trim , 5 degrees ! Left rudder ... And return ! It 's quiet . The flagship Coback should be cracking their rear line with the Atlantic Fleet . That should keep the enemy nice and busy . I hope so . We 're behind schedule , but we get the choice part of this mission . Too bad for the Atlantic Fleet but we 'll be the ones who finish off the enemy . Bio-motor contact ! What ? ! Verifying sound profile ... It 's a Musuca ! Boss ! Musuca 22 is approaching the Blue Fleet by itself ! What did you say ? ! At this rate , they 're going to give our position away ! Number 22 ? That defective prototype who wandered away from the herd ? It looks like a human and a woman are with him . Should we help him ? No , wait . Let them kill him . Let the Blues kill him . Captain ! The Grampus is better suited for this narrow channel ! Order me out to attack with some torpedos ! Wait . It could be a trap . Sonar shows it 's alone . No escorts . Maybe it 's a scout . Strange ... Musuca , closing range ! Sonar ! Go to active search ! Opening torpedo tubes ! Message to all ships ! Take formation around the Typhoon ! Musuca 's speed is unchanged . Anti bio-ship warheads 1 and 2 , loaded ! Range : 5200 and closing . Torpedo tubes are flooded ! Active homing range set ! Number 1 and 3 torpedoes set for speed mode 3 ! Musuca has changed course . Range : 5000 . He 's on a collision course ! A suicide run ? Captain ! Number 1 and 3 tubes , fire ! Take out that Musuca ! No , don 't ! Hayami ? ! That 's what Huang says . Kino ! You 're in too close ! If they attack again ... ! My words do not reach them . Go now . Are you telling me ... ? You knew this would happen ? ! The lifespan of a prototype is brief . I 've swam far enough . I 've seen the auroras of the north , the whales of the south ... The migrating birds of the east , and the playful dolphins of the west . It is enough . My life shall end here . I hear the song . Song ? Colored blue ... Piercing ... A sad song ... You really did it , you bastard . Go now ! To where you belong ! You saved Mutio . I think Papa would like to meet a man like you . Hayami ! Kino ? Ha ... yami ... Go ! Go now ! Hayami ! All I do is get rescued from the sea ... So , you 're piloting it ... You 've gotten better . Not as good as you . Hey ... HEY ! He is calling for you . Go to him now ... Thank you . It doesn 't hurt anymore ... No more cold ... No more loneliness ... If we don 't stop this , it 'll be a slaughter for both sides . Pawns killing other pawns . No different from any of the old wars ! You son of a ... ! I don 't know what you picked up from the enemy but the operation 's already started ! We can 't stop it now ! They 're a lot smarter than you think they are ! Mutio 's people are starting to leave for the Antarctic ! They 've seen our attack coming for a long time ! What ? Then what are you saying we should do ? Zorndyke ... Meet Zorndyke and find out what he 's really after ! It 's not to late to stop us from fighting to the death ! If we don 't , this war will never really be over . Land and sea , each side fiighting the other forever . That 's what Katsuma said ! And now I understand . But this operation is being put on by every country on Earth . Our opinion isn 't going to change anything . That 's why ... That 's why I 'm asking YOU to do this . Commander Iga ... Incoming ! Sonar contacts ! Multiple bio-motors closing ! It 's the Ghost Ship ! You see that , people ? ! They killed our comrade , Red Spot ! Kill them all ! Burn away all traces of the humans ! None of this talk matters . Both sides demand blood and the only paths left are life or death . One or the other . Message to all ships ! Ahead full , combat speed ! Break out of the enemies encircling us ! Ahead full on main and auxiliary drives ! Defend the nukes , even if it takes every ship we have ! This is it ! We fight to the death ! Blue Submarine No. 6 . Final episode : " Minasoko " .

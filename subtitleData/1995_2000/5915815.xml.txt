 You guys want some pork rinds ? Sit back , man . I can feel your hot pork breath on the back of my neck . Turn down the radio . I can 't hear you guys back here . Tell you what , when we 're saying something important - we 'll give you a signal . - [ both laughing ] Yeah , one finger salute to you too . Now pull over . I 've got write my congressman . - What will you give me ? - I 'll give you a stain on your phony leather seat covers . Now pull over . Just joking around , Chester . You know you the man . Who 's the man ? You the man . How could I possibly be the man , when you know you the man ? That 's right , I the man . Happy trails , Chester . Hey , get back here ! Hey , how the hell am I supposed to get home ? Oh , nuts . [ whimpers ] Hit the road ! Beat it . Go . Look , pal , I don 't even like dogs . Especially puntabie little frasier dogs like you . I 'm not in the mood to play . Because my friends just ditched me . I 'm looking at a five-mile walk home and if they weren 't my only friends I 'd dump them in a second . But you wouldn 't understand . Now get lost . [ barking ] Oh , idiot . You got to be more careful , Buddy . Oh , yeah . You 're welcome . You 're my Buddy . Yeah . You 're my Buddy dog . Okay , Buddy . Bam ! [ laughs ] That 's Daddy 's good boy . Come on , let 's go inside . Come on . Come on . Look , he 's portable . You just earned yourself a bowl of beer . Well , that was just too cute . Yeah , it was cute the first 400 times . Besides , he doesn 't play dead very well . You can see his stomach moving when he breathes . Well , I don 't care what you two cynical little weenies think . Chett loves that dog . I think it 's sweet . Oh , my God . - This is so cute . - Yeah , he 's great , isn 't he ? - He sure is . - Yeah . He 's just there , you know ? - I wish people could be more like Buddy . - How so ? My friends are all ... jerks . Let 's just leave it at that . But who needs humans when you 've got a buddy like this ? You know , you could have this both ways . - Both ways ? - I can make Buddy human . All the loving loyal qualities of a dog but in convenient human form . Wow . Would you like that , boy ? Go to ball games with Daddy ? Pee standing up ? Drive the jeep when Daddy 's had a few too many ? Buddy 's on board . Wait a minute . Why are you being so nice to me ? I like this side of you . And people are a little like dogs . When they 're rewarded for good behavior they usually keep it up . - Good boy . - [ barks ] Buddy , stand . Buddy ? Daddy ? That 's a good boy . Stop it . Buddy ? You okay ? - He seems a little freaked . - He 's fine . Just give him a minute . How do you think you 'd feel if you 'd just been zapped from a dog into a man ? Right , right , right . Good point . Yeah . I better take a time out . Come here , Buddy . Have a seat . I 'll give you the lowdown on what it 's like to be a member of the hairless butt club . Buddy ? What 's the matter , boy ? [ whimpers softly ] No couch . " Bad dog . Get down ! " It 's okay , Buddy . You 're allowed . - Really ? - Humans can sit wherever they want . [ Buddy whines ] Soft ! Nice . Feels good . Anyway the touch thing about walking on two legs is ... [ barking softly ] So this is dog man . Hmm . - [ potato chip crunches ] - [ whimpers softly ] - I think he wants a chip . - Gee , you think ? Come on . Give him a chip . Mm . Mm ! Good . More ? Buddy , don 't beg . Bad ! [ whimpers ] So ... this guy was once a dog , huh ? You 'd never know it to look at him . [ whimpers ] Okay , pal . Let 's go . I 'm sorry I yelled , okay ? Does Buddy want to go out ? Huh ? Want to go out ! Want to go out ! And then afterwards , we can go for a burger . Burger . Buddy love Chet ! Buddy love Chet ! - [ whining playfully ] - What are you doing ? Girls ! Pretty girls . Buddy like girls . Hey . Let me give you a tip . Stay frosty . You get more action if you pretend you 're not interested . - Hi ! I 'm Amanda . - Hi ! I 'm Shelly . I 'm Chet , and , uh ... this is Buddy . - Hi , Buddy ! - Hi , Buddy ! - Mm ! - Buddy was starving , so we thought we 'd come over and introduce ourselves . He 's so cute ! And look at those big , soulful eyes ! Oh ! Poor thing . He had an eye booger . - Is it okay if we sit down ? - That 'd be nice . [ giggles ] [ girls giggling and cooing ] Booja-booja-boo . Who 's my little boo boo ? [ panting ] I 've got a date with Amanda . You 'll have to stick around here , okay ? I 'll be back . No , Buddy . I said stay . Now , look , I know you don 't know what daiting is . Trust me . It 's not a team sport . Okay ? Now , stay . [ falsetto ] : Oh , my God ! He 's gone ! He 's gone ! He 's gone ! Who 's going to feed me ? ! I 'm starving ! I 'm starving ! - Are you going to knock that off ? - Oh , thank God ! He 's back ! You were gone so long , I thought you were never coming back . Don 't make me use this . Now , stay ! [ door shuts ] Oh ! Somebody had a party . - Buddy ! - What ? ! What ? ! What ? ! What ? ! What ? ! Did you do this ? [ whimpers ] : Uh ... no . - Buddy ! - Miss Daddy . - So you destroyed the house ? - Bad human . - [ whines ] - Oh . He didn 't mean it . Chet shouldn 't have left him here all by himself . - Poor baby . - [ Buddy whimpers ] Buddy like this . So would Gary . Get away from me , you little horn dog . What did he do ? Let 's just say my leg better get a phone call tomorrow . [ sniffs ] Find Daddy ! So ... " Amanda . " Is that short for something ? [ laughs ] You are funny , Chet . You know , when I first met you I was really interested in your friend Buddy , but then my friend Shelly said that she liked Buddy so I said I 'd take you . - Thanks . - Yeah . I mean , you 're really cute and everything but Buddy is so ... Can we not talk about him ? Oh ! Fine by me . [ chuckles ] Oh ! So happy to see you ! So long ! So long ! So happy ! What the hell are you doing here ? - [ shrill help ] - I told you to stay home . Chet ! Don 't hurt him . He missed you . That ... that is so sweet . You want to sit ?

Yeah , you know , 5 ' 8 " toilet breath , eats his own vomit . He 's around somewhere . He 's fine . Just ... fine . He can take care of himself . Nothing 's going to happen to him . Get off my back ! I 'm hungry , Daddy . M-make the bad man stop , Daddy . Don 't look at me that way . Some sweet old lady 's going to find you . Give you a nice , happy home . Feed you the best gourmet food . I don 't like apples , Daddy . [ sobbing ] I 'm coming , Buddy . Daddy 's coming ! Buddy ! Buddy ! Come here , boy ! Buddy ! Buddy ! Come on , boy ! You hear me ? Buddy ! Buddy ! Buddy ! Come on , Buddy ! Where are you ? [ yelling ] Holy crap . [ groaning ] Help ! Help ! Help ! - Daddy ? - Buddy ! Oh ... Oh , am I glad you 're here . Buddy , listen to me . I need your help . - Play ball ? - We 're not going to play ball right now . I need you to go get help . Here 's the deal , Buddy . I need you to go get help , Buddy . Buddy ... Buddy get help ! [ playing one note badly ] Buddy , what happened to you ? You been digging in the trash again ? Buddy get help . Buddy help Daddy . - Okay , Buddy . Good boy . - What 's he talking about ?

[ barking ] Buddy get ... [ barking ] [ continues barking ] - GARY : What 's happened ? - The spell wore off . Great . Now we 'll never know what he was trying to tell us . No , wait . I 've always wanted to do this . Buddy , what are you trying to tell us , boy ? - What is it ? - [ barking ] You were playing ball with Chett and then you couldn 't find him ? Then you did find him , but he 'd fallen down an abandoned mine shaft , and he sent you for help ? Page 548 of the Road Atlas ? Square C-7 ? - [ barking ] - Got it . Let 's go save Chett . [ barking ] Buddy ? - Chett ? - Lisa ? - Hey , how you doing , big guy ? - You okay ? - Yeah . - Let 's get you out of there . Ooh , I 'm sorry . Did I get you ? It was supposed to be these sticky fingers . You couldn 't have picked a worse possible moment . [ grunting ] Okay , let 's give it a shot . Aw , you did it , Buddy . I knew you could do it . That 's my Buddy-boy . So , why is he a dog again anyway ? - The spell wore off . - Geez , your magic sucks . - [ chuckling softly ] - I saw that . Can you give us a little privacy ? Listen , I want to thank you for saving my life . I 'm sorry I ditched you back there . I guess I never had a real friend before . I 'm not very good at it . Sorry . Daddy , Buddy love Chett . [ chuckling ] Aw ... Yes . Mmm . [ barking ] So , you haven 't seen him ? I 've had him since he was that small . Well , looks like somebody is looking for you . Hey , you don 't have to go back to him , you know ? If he was mean to you , or something you could stay right here with me . Can I put one here maybe ? Okay . I get it . You should go . You 're his dog . Well , go on then . Get out of here . Don 't be a stranger . Floofer ! Where have you been ? I 've missed you so ... - [ whimpering ] - Good boy . Hi , Chett . Why so sad ? I just lost the best friend I ever had , that 's all . Oh .. ! Who ? My dog . Oh , you poor guy . Yeah , is there anything we can do ? Well ... the thought of going back to that big , empty house ... the memory of that sweet little high-pitched bark ... I don 't think I should be alone tonight . Mmm , we understand .

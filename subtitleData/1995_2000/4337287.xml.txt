 COMMENTARY : I 'm Lew Morton . I wrote this . I have a story about this scene . This is , of course , a parody of the chess scene in Star Wars . The Star Wars people saw it , and I was invited to Skywalker Ranch to drink their wine and hang out and help think of stupid marketing ideas because of this scene . You 're the guy who thought of Jar Jar , right ? - Yeah . Do you like it ? - Thanks a lot ! My name is Rich Moore , I 'm the supervising director . Brian Sheesley , guest directing for Jeffrey Lynch , who directed this . - David X. Cohen , executive producer . - Lew Morton again . Christopher Tyng , composer . Me llamo Billy West . I 'm learning Spanish . And this is Matt Groening . PROFESSOR : Good news . We have a mission to further intergalactic peace . - Nope . Watching cartoons . - Sorry . COMMENTARY : She 's strong . - She is . She can ... How much does Bender weigh ? 525 pounds . - She can knock him off a couch . - We learn it in episode 208 . He said the unspoken words . Is this the first time we mention the DOOP by name ? - Yes , it is . It is . - Is it the last time we mention it ? - Democratic Order Of Planets ? - Yeah . - We say it all the time . - We do ? Cool . I do . The bootleggers are duping off these episodes . DOOP spelled upside down is DOOP . - There it is . - Isn 't it POOD ? What are those , ambigrams ? When a word looks the same different ways ? I know what I call it : awesome . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] Totally ! This lady had an episode devoted to her and her kind . - You mean the one right before this ? - No , from season three . - Oh , season three , 301 . - With the Amazonians . - I am rightfully shamed . - All seasons are the same to David . I remember the concept of the Neutral people , who spoke very boringly . That it would be funny was ... There were many doubters . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] - You 're right , it 's funny . - David Cohen , as I recall you were slapping your knees every time they said they were Neutral . That 's true . The original script had about 50 more scenes of them saying Neutral things . We could have chickened out and cut them but you get to see them because of David Cohen . - We left the right number in . - It 's the best part of the show . - What 's the right number ? - Four . The number is alpha naught , a concept to be introduced in another episode . Like you said . As always , Billy West as Zapp Brannigan . Maurice LaMarche as Kif . I like where Zapp is talking about Neutral people in a hateful way . LEADER : ... who just returned from a carpet-bombing of Eden Seven Zapp Brannigan . COMMENTARY : Sociopath . - 3-D graphics . - That 's the Nimbus , Zapp 's ship . Nimbus is either a type of cloud or the halo around a Greek god , if I remember my definition correctly . ZAPP : No matter . I 'll simply cut it from here with the ship 's laser . That may not be wise . COMMENTARY : Complicated 2-D animation moves really fast . In the hands of a pinhead like him . Great sound effects by Travis Powers . That could be one of my most favorite animated explosions ever . - It 's pretty . - " Oops , I did it again . " JUDGE : You are accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters . How do you plead ? Absolutely 99 percent not guilty . COMMENTARY : That the only O.J. joke ? - Yes . That is a great character . Is this Chicken Lawyer 's first appearance ? - Yes . - Hyper-chicken . - Maurice LaMarche . - Sort of doing a Gerry Spence . Billy , just to prove that you did that voice of Peepeye there do it now . This is no processing on Billy 's voice . Listen . FUNNY VOICE : I 'm not doing a dog-and-pony show for you . There you go . BUZZES : I 'm your annoying alarm clock that used to be before digital ones . Get up ! Shut up ! - Man , you did that great . - Oh , my God . - The noises that come out of Billy . - Now Chris Tyng , you do a voice . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] Not hired for that job . That 's all I 'm good for . I 'm basically an empty vessel . LEELA : Zapp 's the worst captain ever . I saw him blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye . - I 'd like to cross-examine . - I 'll allow it . COMMENTARY : Luckily we have a lawyer , Patric Verrone , to instruct us in the intricacies of law , so we 're always accurate . [ MAN LAUGHS ] This is future space law . ZAPP : ... you had sex with . Whoa ! - And his name is ? - Zapp Brannigan . The same man who didn 't blow up DOOP headquarters . I rest my case . [ SHOES SQUEAKING ] COMMENTARY : Squeaky shoe . - Nice . Matt Groening insists on a squeaky shoe when the opportunity arises . Well , that 's true . I thought you were gonna try to deny it . This could be the only character I 'd be happy ... . - I enjoy that voice . - Spin-off . That character ... FUNNY VOICE : The Me Show . He appeared in another Lew Morton-penned episode . He appeared whenever I could put him in . He 's half of Glurmo from the Slurm Factory episode . - The name is Small Glurmo Number One . - They 're all little buzz saw voices . ZAPP : Kif , come and hold up the flag . Wave it a little , for God 's sake . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] COMMENTARY : Great performance . ZAPP : But you can 't take away his integrity and honor . - Plus , it was Kif 's fault . KIF : What ? You too are stripped of your rank and dishonorably discharged . [ GAVEL BANGS ] [ SIGHS ] For a while , it seemed like every act of every show ended with Kif sighing . That was the golden age of the show . KIF : No , it doesn 't . - Come , Kif . It 's time to begin our life as civilians . That 's an order , soldier ! COMMENTARY : Original , or extra crispy ? [ MAN CHUCKLES ] Great . Perfect . So good . You don 't see rack focuses too often in cartoons . - You gonna tell what this references ? - You are . No . Please don 't , I can 't ... I can 't tell . - Midnight Cowboy . - With Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight ? That 's it . And John McGiver , English actor , the bald guy who played the religious nut . - That 's Hattie in a limo . - She 's rich . - She 's having a night on the town . - Playing the slots . LEELA : This is the third hose fight I 've broken up . And the second one with real hoses . [ GROUP HOLLERING ] COMMENTARY : Lew Morton , writer ! - What 's happening here ? That would be a really good DVD commentary , just a hooting audience . Let 's do it . - Whoo ! - Yeah ! LEELA : I never loved you . - Physically . - What is it ? Let me work for food . I 'll paint , or service you sexually , or mop up . [ GROUP HOLLERING ] COMMENTARY : All right . - He wants to service her sexually . Look at the " Slam " button right here . PROFESSOR : You 're that disgraced captain . He 'll distract people from our awful safety record . Come in ! I want everyone to meet our new employees . Which ones are new ? - The green dude and the fat man . - I haven 't seen that robot before . I 'm Bender . You know , the lovable rascal . COMMENTARY : We 've totally run out of energy . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] This is the fourth commentary we 've recorded tonight . - The first one was gangbusters . - Oh , my God . - When you ... - Define " gangbusters . " We were on fire . We were watching Gangbusters . Or was that only a radio show ? We should do a commentary on the commentary . Oh , boy . Note in this scene that the Planet Express ship is at a right angle . - To what ? - To itself . - It 's an L-shaped Planet Express ship . - Yeah , this is all screwed up . This is just a mess . This very long room goes east-west and the bridge goes north-south . Who started those angles in the movies , filming stuff sideways ? Not those kind of angles . Not the Dutch kind . Dutch angles . I like them working on the ship . We should bring them back . He 's so humble and appreciative . - I have a cold . - Who does ? - Need a tissue ? - No . One thing bothers me . When we were trying to make the show make sense we thought , " They 'll deliver stuff around the universe . " But they deliver pillows . But you know what ? I bought weights to exercise with , lead weights . I noticed they said " Made in China . " Apparently , it was worth shipping lead weights across the ocean . Therefore , it might be worth shipping pillows across the universe . In overseas shipping , it 's how many you can fit in a container . It 's not the weight . On Star Trek , they rarely visited planets with different gravity . - And oxygen . - We 're hitting new sci-fi ground here . They always wound up on a planet with oxygen . All science fiction takes place on planets with oxygen . And red skies . LEELA : So now you have to hand-deliver all 40 pillows . I have a serious question . Does the company that made your bra do girdles ? - I ask because a friend ... - Just get to work ! BENDER : I 'm Leela . Get to work . COMMENTARY : Wasn 't there a scene that we cut ? Yes . They get to the Stumbos hotel and deliver the pillows and get a tip of one Stumbonian coin , which weighs about 50 tons . They were really big . My favorite thing when I was a kid was the world 's largest coin which was the Nambukin stone coin , or some island tribe stone ... It was Glambukin . It was 1 0 feet in diameter , made of stone . It ... No , you 're right . Nambukin . It could be exchanged for a canoe or a wife . Bring it into Starbucks and see what happens . Get a wife and a canoe ? - Yeah , if you 're a two-coin-naire . - Uh-huh . ZAPP : A good captain needs many skills like boldness , daring , and a velour uniform . I 'm not convinced she has any of those . COMMENTARY : Velour ... . FRY : She just makes us work so much . When I was captain , I only wanted my men 's loyalty . COMMENTARY : His pot belly hangs out a little more in high gravity . His belly was supposed to develop from show to show . But after we did it in the first season when he and Leela made love , it was hanging out . It got bigger and bigger . When we showed it , you were grossed out . So you said , " Let 's keep it one size . " - What the hell went on there ? - I don 't know . I like he has the Love-Nasium on his ship . ZAPP : Throw her in the brig . - What brig ? - Then the laundry room which will hereafter be called the " brig . " COMMENTARY : A brig would be a waste of space on a spaceship . - Exactly . - They have a laundry room . They have a big laundry room . With multiple machines . It 's in use . - Who 's doing their laundry right now ? - And don 't forget fabric softener . It 's not Bender , since he 's naked . Fry never wears anything but what he 's got on . Good old Leela . The others are in uniforms . ZAPP : Back in uniform . It nearly still fits . COMMENTARY : There he 's fatter . KIF : What do I do with these clothes ? - Put them in the laundry brig . COMMENTARY : And bring back my other truss . FRY : Ten hundred percent . - That 's not enough . You 're to sit and drink until you 're as loyal as Kif . - Yes , sir , sir ! - May I have a beer , sir ? No . You 're loyal enough . Meanwhile , I have a plan . COMMENTARY : Don 't worry . More Neutral comedy coming up . Yes . We didn 't forget . It happened while you were talking , I think . - Oh . - Some of it . - Oh , there 's much more . - I like being in Neutral . It 's all different . We 're not promoting ... . - Killing Neutral people ? - Alcoholism ? Anti-Neutralism ? Which of society 's ills are you most concerned about ? This is really nicely animated . They animated Billy 's crazy performance perfectly . - Dwayne Caray-Hill animated that . - He 's a director now . - He got promoted . - For that scene . Good work , Dwayne . See ? - Actually , that was surrendering . - I love it . " Live free or don 't . " That 's Neutral humor . - Gray , you know . - That 's Neutral . NEUTRAL MAN : All I know is my gut says " maybe . " COMMENTARY : See , there were naysayers . - We didn 't put enough Neutral humor in . - I absolutely agree . FRY : And then ? - Then your mission is complete . I 'll already have ejected wearing the only space suit . - Wait . Is this gonna kill us ? - Yes . That 's what I meant by loyalty . Now help me into the only suit . It 's sweaty . You may need baby powder . COMMENTARY : And they 're gonna help him . I love it . - No , they 're not . - They 're not ? Oh , switcheroo . LEELA : He ran out of beer ? So he 's about to kill us ? - We want Leela to be captain . - Mutiny ? Never thought I 'd see the day . Come , Kif . There 's a child 's suit for you . COMMENTARY : That was handy . It was here , off-screen . [ GROUP LAUGHING ] Does that suit have a handle on the back ? [ GROUP LAUGHING ] It 's a comedy handle . LEELA : He 's disabled the steering ! We 're gonna crash ! Leela , save me ! And yourself , I guess . And my banjo ! And Fry . COMMENTARY : That was a saxophone ... - A French horn . French horn . But we remembered Bender liked the banjo from episode 1 02 . Bender plays the banjo a lot in coming episodes . And he does it with 1 05-pound hands . FRY : And warm . - Just do it ! Your Neutralness , beige alert . COMMENTARY : The very Neutral alarm . - Yeah . That was it , baby . Neutral comedy is in the house . - It 's in my house . - It 's in his house . I like that we kept the dark matter from episode 1 04 . It powers the ship . Neutral comedy tonight on FOX . - Tonight on a new Neutral Planet . - It all starts with Futurama . I think there 's one more . Prepare yourselves . ZAPP : My quick mind saved the day . Captain Leela , is this rambling ... COMMENTARY : Wait for it . - Is that it ? - There 's no more . - There isn 't . - No more Neutral jokes . This joke doesn 't take a strong stand . Maybe you were thinking of it . That was it . [ MAN LAUGHS ] You knew there was a callback to some joke from earlier in the episode . In one version of the script , they asked the Neutral planet president if it was okay to reinstate Zapp . I don 't remember what he said . But he might not have had a strong opinion . Did Zapp just get bigger at the end of the last scene ? You animators , did he ? - I wasn 't paying attention . - Good work . Yes . Yes , he was . He 's out of control . LEELA : Let 's mutiny . COMMENTARY : The password is " mutiny . " Thank you for buying our DVD . - Take them while you can get them . - Big credits . Don 't get that on TV .

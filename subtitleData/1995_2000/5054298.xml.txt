Bee , let 's kick his ass . Move it ! You 've got some broken glass . You didn 't lose anything . So ? I didn 't do it . If I did , I would have trashed your stall . Wouldn 't be so neat . What do you think ? Who broke all my glass just to take one phone ? Guy probably sold it to you , didn 't like the price you gave him , came back for it . It 's so simple ! That 's exactly right ! The only phone stolen was the phone you sold me . So , it must be you two then ! What makes you think I did it ? Yeah . You know what the phone 's worth . How would I know ? Hey , Sushi Boy got beat up , the phone shop gets busted ... Do you think it 's that guy coming back for revenge ? If it 's him , he should 've come after us . So , he made a mistake . And why this shop ? What the hell 's happening ? You guys done ? This mess is because of you two . Pay me three hundred and I 'll forget about this . What ? Why don 't you pay us ? Now there 's an idea ! This is mud from the Mediterranean Sea . It usually goes for sixty to seventy dollars . I 'm giving you a fifty percent discount because we 're friends . If you don 't say something I 'll take that as a yes . Hey , you 've got a zit already ? Here , I 'll get something for it . Wait here . Three hundred ! We had nothing to do with it . That 's right ! Pay up or I 'll call my boys . Let 's just forget it , ok ? Forget it . What the hell do you know ? Get lost ! If I let this go , how would I look in front of my boys ? Go do some work ... Not paying ? Fine ! Sai-fai , I 've got a problem , send fifty guys down to my shop . Aren 't you overdoing it ? What , you scared ? Pay me then . Think I 'm stupid ? I have plenty of boys to back me up . But we really had nothing to do with it ... Hello ? Hey , Woody. lt 's Sai-fai . Kui called for help . He ain 't got money or power any more . You want to take pity ? He 's got no money and no power and he needs help now ? We 're there already ... Kui , what can we do for you ? Yeah , you just let us know . I 've got plenty of backup . You guys just try it . Pay me , or I 'll come after you . Oh , please do . Yeah , soon , I hope . Why wait ? You 're Kui , not King . Plenty of guys to back you , my ass ! Close shop . Let 's get out of here ! Nothing else ? Let 's go . Bye . Hey , don 't leave yet . I 've called the cops , they 're on their way . What 's the matter with you ? Are you sick in the head or something ? Why 'd you call the police for ? It 's just a little broken glass and you called the cops ? Son of a bitch ! What the hell did you do that for ? Just ignore him . Let 's get outta here . He 's so goddamn stupid . All brawn and no brain . That 's right ! Do you think when we get older we 'll be like Kui ? No power , no money , just an old man who gets kicked around by young guys ? Of course not ... I hope not . Naw , we won 't . We ain 't gonna live that long . You might not but I 'm gonna live long . You might not even last till forty . Watch your step , you bastard ... What , trying to scare me ? I really wanted to kick your ass before . What 's the matter , think you 're the Terminator ? Open ... Open ... Open . Sushi Boy sure was acting weird before . He 's just trying to scare us . Did it work on you ? Officer , I didn 't call the police , this big dumb ox did . But your shop was broken into . It 's none of your goddamn business . Stop poking me with questions ! A , we 're not questioning you . B , did someone break into your shop or not ? No , my wife and I had an argument and we broke some glass . That 's right . Hear that ? Officer , can we leave now ? No , what do you take us cops for ? Huh ? You two guys up there ! Stop sneaking around and come down here . We have this place surrounded . is that necessary ? Where were you between the hours of 6 and 10 pm tonight ? Eating dinner with friends . Eating what ? Japanese food , the place over there . How long were you eating ? About an hour . And then ? We went to the theater ... Together ? No , Woody left in the middle of the movie . Do you know where he went ? The girl we were with drank too much so he left with her saying that they were gonna do something . And then ? In the end we couldn 't get tickets so we went to eat . To eat ? And afterwards ? After eating we went back to the shop that 's when I heard about the break in at the phone store . I was in the bathroom and I saw Sushi Boy , Woody and Rolls in there . Almost everybody was in there . Then we found out about the break in . Well ? Look at this , their stories don 't even match with each other . Unbelievable . Hey , I told the truth ! Well , I told the truth too ! What , do you think we 're idiots ? Both of these statements are totally different . Hey you over there , who else is still in the mall ? Some girls who work in the beauty parlor and the Sushi Boy . They 're not around right now . I don 't know where they went . Couldn 't find them , oh ? The Sushi Boy got beat up earlier today in the bathroom . Why are you staring at us ? We didn 't do nothing ! Don 't drag us into this ! A , just because I 'm looking at you doesn 't mean I think it 's you . B , just from your expression , you look guilty . C , Don 't try to pin this on us . We 're taxpayers ! D , let 's find the guy and clear this up . Let 's go to the control room so we can straighten this out . What kind of mall is this ? It 's as quiet as hell . Fast forward on this please . All right . What are you staring at ? Yeah , no need to stare , we 're not gonna try to leave . Pan the area. I want to see . You understand , officer ? These cameras can 't pan ... Excuse me sir , but I wanted to ask if your partner was crazy . You shouldn 't be asking me something like that ! He 's my partner . Come with me ! You have the freedom to ask me questions but we need you to cooperate with us and to stop joking . I 'm warning you now , he is my partner . Be ready ... Do you want us to cooperate with you ? I 'm asking you ! Where you guys going ? Officer , I ... I ... I ... What are you trying to pull ? I 'll report you ! Report what ? Police brutality ! What do you mean ? You 're hurting me ! Stop moving ! There 's no need to confiscate my phone ! So what if I do ? We were just trying to scare him , we didn 't mean anything by it . We weren 't the ones who beat him up ! You 're taking the heat for this anyway ! Hey , you can 't pin this on me ! How about the robbery then ? No , sir . Officer , Bee 's always wanted to become a cop . He was just pretending to be one , scaring him and asking to see his id . I told him not to , but he really wanted to . I 'm not lying sir . What is this ? Not sure ... ls your dream to become a drug dealer when you grow up ? Drugs ? That 's drugs ? Why was that in my wallet ? That 's right , we were looking through Sushi Boy 's wallet and we were just wondering what that was so we borrowed it . That 's drugs ? Oh my gosh , sir , if we 'd known that we 'd never have touched it ! We don 't do drugs ! Honest ! I 'm still booking you for drug possession . But , sir , we don 't do drugs ! See how healthy and clean we look ? Cut the bullshit , I don 't want to hear it ! No , sir , it 's not bullshit . Woody 's always wanted to be a lawyer so he goes overboard with explanations but we 're actually really good kids . We have good jobs , but today 's our day off so we 're minding the shop for our dad . We 're actually on our way to volunteer at the hospital to help the elderly . If we 're late , the elderly will be real disappointed . So please , Sir , just let us go . You guys are pretty good at making up stories , aren 't you ? Just shut up ! ... didn 't say nothing . May 9th ? So today 's your birthday . Kind of a unique way you have of celebrating ... Robbing and mugging ! Why didn 't you tell me ? I kinda did . Why didn 't you just tell me straight ? I thought you 'd know . Happy birthday , man . Thanks . Hey , look , it 's Sushi Boy . I see him . The beauty salon girl is with him . So , go and take a look . Just shut up ... Hey , go down and check it out . You go down and take a look . I told you to go . Play you for it . Okay . You lose , you go . Go ! You don 't know how ugly you really are . What 's going on ?

I don 't pay taxes ... I go to work late , I get laid any time I want , I smoke grass whenever . Yeah , I do have it good . So , life 's good to you . Sometimes ... Yeah .

They didn 't want me to tell the cops , so they 're trying to scare us off . I 'll get ' em tomorrow ... Let 's go . We can 't . The cops told us to wait right here . Can 't you see that everybody 's gone already ? Let 's get out of here . Jelly , run ! What is it ? Oh shit ! Watch your back ! Honey , how come the lights are off ? So what ?

Rolls , take one of us together . No , you can 't do that . My funeral picture should be only of me , not us . Please ... Woody , send a knife and a paper man to the afterlife for me . I 've always wanted to kill somebody . I haven 't been able to do it in life so I 'll do it in the afterlife . Woody , I 'm so scared . Okay pal , I 'll take the picture for you .

It 's not moving ! Keep trying ... Go ! Go ! This is an emergency announcement . Survivors should hide themselves in a safe place from the zombies . Do not drink any soft drink as it may contain a biochemical substance . Were you able to call the police ?

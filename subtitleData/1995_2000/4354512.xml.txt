 Distinguished Flying Cross . Air Force , right ? I believe it was my father 's . His name up here ? I don 't know what war he served in . I never knew him . All these names . I wonder how many never had the chance to know their sons and daughters . Too many . Well , at least you know your old man had to have been a hero ... to earn that . Cherish it and his memory . [ Woman ] Excuse me . Did you know my father ? - Not her again . - Did you know my father ? P.F.C. Mark Clements . Bravo Company . Do you know her ? Uh , she 's been coming here for 10 years , trying to get her father 's name on the wall . Stationed in Qui Nhon , ' 71 and ' 72 ? - Army Rangers . - I 'm sorry . Well , if her father died in the war , shouldn 't his name be on the wall ? Only heroes go up here . Ma 'am , you 've been warned about doing this . - You 're gonna have to come with us now . - Okay . Wait ! Please . See , this is not even fair . My father 's name belongs up there . - He belongs on the wall . - I 'm sorry . Okay ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Man ] Tonight on Battle Zone ... a tragic story of treason and betrayal in Vietnam . With the report , Jordan Brock . Toe poppers - a colloquial term for pressure-activated land mines . - You step on one , you hear a click . - [ Clicks ] You step off , and it 's the last sound you 'll ever hear . Army Intelligence is reeling from the discovery ... that Private First Class Mark Clements ... was selling classified information to the Vietcong . It was on this spot , atop one of these mines ... that Private Clements 's dark tale of treason came to an end ... with the discovery of top-secret documents on his body . Clements 's platoon leader , Lieutenant Prentiss McClaren , was a witness . Mark Clements was like a brother . I 'd have laid down my life for him . Then you find out he 's a traitor . What makes a man cross that line , I don 't know . He let everyone down . Come here . This is one of the local kids . He 's our unit 's mascot . He lives on the base . He saw it all . Mark meet with Vietcong . I hear click . I hear explosion . Mark was my friend . I watch Mark die . This is Jordan Brock reporting . [ Man On Radio ] Keep your eyes open , people . Anybody seen him ? He 's out there somewhere . - Keep moving . - [ Grunts ] - Keep moving ! - I have movement at the tree line . - [ Screams ] - Padia - tree line . Got him . - [ Grunts ] - Where are you ? [ Frustrated Grunt ] All right . ! All right already . ! - Damn it ! - [ Helicopter Passing ] Where the hell are you ? I believe you dropped this , sir . Hell of a job , Lieutenant . Where 'd you learn to camo so well ? I 've had a lot of practice in blending in , sir . Fantastic . Watched the whole thing on the monitor . Those helmet cameras . What do you call ' em ? Tactical aniscopic cameras . TAC 's . Well , they 're gonna do for you what CNN did for Desert Storm - - Give us all a taste of what it 's like to be Rambo . - Ram who ? Cute . And if multiple T.A.C. ' s can document a real incursion ... Capitol Hill 's gonna bend over backwards to fund your missions , Captain McClaren . - That 's the idea . - I 'll need analysis figures for Congressman Stanfield . He 'll get the ball rolling appropriating the RD funds . Well done . - [ Engine Starts ] - Bureaucratic weasel . LieutenantJarod Patton ... Master Sergeant Rob Hancock , Staff Sergeant Alyssa Padia . Watch out for her . She looks nice , but she bites like a pit bull . Lieutenant , welcome to Operation Dustoff . Ajoint mission with the Colombian military to infiltrate and destroy ... narcotics processing factories . Intel has uncovered a major shipment of coca paste ... on its way to a factory near Cartagena , owned by - Esteban Largo . You are all on alert , so wear your pagers 24 / 7 . - [ Debbie ] Dad ? - [ Broots ] Yeah ? - Am I supposed to be here ? - Well , sure . We 're gonna have great fun . Look . Here . No , you sit down , right here . And , oh , you got Barbie . That 's fun , huh ? Uh , you can color . So , all you have to do is just sit here and-and be really , really quiet ... until it 's time to go home . A-And then we 'll have great fun . Broots . Uh , or not . Did I miss the memo on day care ? [ Sighs ] The sitter 's got the German measles . Debbie 's godmother is on a Pritikin retreat . I had no other choice . It 's called the yellow pages . " B " for babysitter ? I would never leave my daughter alone with someone that I don 't know . I 'm sorry , but she 's staying here with me . If that 's okay with you . Just make sure Little Miss Muffet stays out of my way . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Clears Throat ] Broots . Uh , Mr. Raines . Yes , sir . No . I love Miami . Um - Okay . Right away . Jarod has penetrated the database at the Miami office . Mr. Raines wants me to go down there and do an immediate mainframe inventory . Sydney . Uh , c-could you ... help me out with Debbie ? Sorry , Broots , but I 'm supervising three sets of twins ... in the sim lab on a sleep deprivation watch . [ Sighs ] Don 't even think about it . Oh , come on . It 's-It 's a day , maybe two days , tops . I don 't do Mommy . I don 't know , Miss Parker . It might help you process unresolved childhood issues . [ Scoffs ] It never ends with you , does it ? [ Sighs ] You owe me big . l-l-I owe you huge . Thank you . Thank you . Jell-O ? And it 's a dessert ? Like at the end of the lunch line in school , remember ? - Actually , my food was brought to me . - You did feed yourself ? For the most part . Now , if the gelatin is soft ... the pineapple chunks sink to the bottom . But if it 's too hard , they would just lie there on top . My guess would be you have to wait for the proper viscosity ... to actually add the chunk . [ Chuckling ] Hmm . Mmm . Mmm . - Is that the captain ? - [ Padia ] Yeah . That 's him back in Vietnam , his glory days . You know what I miss most about that war ? - My hair . - Bravo Company . Qui Nhon . Do you still keep in touch with the men ? One that 's still alive - Barney Stanfield . Congressman Stanfield . Used to boss that little grunt around . Now he 's in charge of my appropriations . If you don 't mind , I took the liberty of writing down a comparative analysis report ... of the T.A.C. system that Congressman Stanfield 's aide requested . I compared fourJapanese manufacturers with two Minnesota-based companies . - Conclusions ? - Buy American . Padia . Run this up to Capitol Hill . If you don 't mind , Captain , I 'd like to take this to the congressman myself . I 've never been that close to the real seat of power . Just so we understand each other ... these are the house rules . No running , no playing ... no feet on the furniture ... and no noise , which includes both crying and whining . Be invisible , and we 'll get along just fine . [ Phone Rings ] - [ Rings ] - Your clothes are so pretty . And no touching my stuff , especially my clothes . What ? Hold on , Sydney . - What are you doing ? - Nothing . I told you to stay out of my things , and I mean it ! [ Sighs ] [ Jarod ] Congressman Stanfield , I have the TAC report from Captain McClaren . - So how is that old warhorse these days ? - Still bald , sir . I like this guy . I 'm , uh - Congressman Leon Beckwith , 11 th District , Louisiana . You chair the Vietnam Memorial Wall Subcommittee ... that Congressman Stanfield sits on . You a registered voter , son ? No , sir , but I did help manipulate the Nixon landslide in 1972 . I really like this guy ! - Nice meeting you , Lieutenant . - You as well , sir . Leon . I hope you can appreciate a good cigar . Yes , sir . - Santiago Caribe . - Private reserve . You gotta know somebody to get ahold of one of these . [ Intercom Beeps ] [ Woman On Intercom ] Denise Clements is here again . Shall I call Security ? Uh , no . Um , send her in . - Is there a problem ? - Oh , a tragedy . One that won 't go away , I 'm afraid . Please , stay . Sorry to show up without an appointment . I have two daughters myself , Denise . I only hope that they love me half as much as you do your father . Please , sit down . Congressman , I talked with a Corporal Ethington from the 185th ... who knew a man named Duke . As you know , my father wrote a letter about a G.I. named Duke ... who was helping him to catch a traitor , not act as one . Sir , if this is the same Duke , I believe he can help me clear my father 's name . Miss Clements , we 've talked about this letter many times ... but it 's circumstantial evidence , regardless of what this Duke person has to say . If you can bring him to the next subcommittee meeting , I 'll see to it you 're heard . Thank you . - Her father served with you in Bravo Company . - Yes . Mark Clements was the last man you 'd have thought would turn out to be a traitor . Mark Clements was the last man you 'd have thought would turn out to be a traitor . Shejust won 't let go of what she wants to believe . [ Jarod ] Someone once said that " Old soldiers never die . They simply fade away . " But I don 't think the same can be said about their memory . I think it grows stronger . Who are you ? Someone who doesn 't believe that your father was a traitor . My name is Jarod . [ Sighs ] This must be very difficult for you . It 's all I 've ever known . It wasn 't until after I buried my mother ... that I realized ... how important it was ... to get his name up there . If I give up , that 's as good as saying he 's guilty , and I know he wasn 't . This is the last letter my father wrote home , back in ' 72 . " Duke found out one of our guys is selling secrets to Charlie . If I find out who , God help him . " So you think that the real traitor discovered that your father was onto him ... and framed him . But no one believes me . I believe you . [ Young Sydney On Monitor ] I want you to tell me what 's wrong ... with each of these pictures . [ Jarod ] The chimney 's missing there . The door 's upside down there . The fence is missing a post there ... and the address numbers are inverted there . Look closer , Jarod . [ Jarod ] The sun 's shadow off the wood stack ... it 's misdirected in all of them . - I missed it . - Most people would , Jarod . Their eyes can only perceive the obvious . But to maximize your gift , your eyes must perceive everything . Mark was my friend . I watch Mark die . Mark die . I watch Mark die . Le Xuan Duc . Duke . Hello , Duke . Broots , what do you mean it 's going to take longer than you thought ? - Well , but I 'm trying - - Do you mind ! - How 's Debbie ? - She 's fine . See , it 's me that you should be worried about . - I 'll be back as soon as I can . - [ Beeps ] Mama ? Show me how to braid my hair . Did you get it ? You 'll see . We 'll open it after school , okay ? You have very pretty hair . - Would you braid mine like that ? - I have things to do . How did you get to be so mean ? I was born that way . No . You weren 't . [ Asian Accent ] You want to be rich ? Of course you do . And I here to show you how to get rich quick ... with my new video series , How To Get Rich Quick . My name Lenny Duc . I come to your country in tiny boat . And now I own big boat ! American dream , number one . ! - And cut it ! Perfect , Lenny . - [ Bell Rings ] That 's lunch . [ Loses Accent ] I 've got a table reserved over at the Woodbridge Club ... if you 'd care to join me . I don 't think so . Excuse me , Mr. Duc . I 'm a really big fan of your work . Well , 89.95 , plus shipping and handling , puts you on the road to the American dream . And what a dream it is . Ayoung Vietnamese boy emigrating to America with nothing ... and building this empire . Hey , as a matter of fact , you remind me of this little boy I saw on this old news report ... about this G.I. in Vietnam ... who died an alleged traitor . What was his name ? Oh , yes . Mark Clements . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - [ Beeping ] Well , sorry to bother you . Have a nice day . [ Man On Radio ] Operation Dustoff , you are two hours from your Colombian target . Good luck . [ Chattering In Spanish ] [ Spanish Continues ] They have no idea we 're here . Well , they 're about to find out . [ Cheering ] What a beauty ! [ Man ] Oh , lookin 'good . ! Bet Esteban Largo was not too thrilled with your handiwork . - Well done , Lieutenant . - I was proud to be on board , sir . Hope you can appreciate a fine cigar . It 's a Santiago Caribe . Well , th-Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . They 're about to show me on TV . [ Tape Rewinding . Explosion ] He 's never given me one of his special cigars , and I like cigars . - What are you doing ? - Do you notice anything ? [ Padia ] C - 4 has a hell of a kick . Look at the surrounding debris . There was nothing inside that factory . There 's drums , burnt powder ... lab equipment . Yes , but enough to process a hundred tons of coca paste ? What are you saying ? That somebody tipped off Esteban Largo that we were coming . He moves everything out ... and leaves just enough evidence behind ... so we think we made a big hit . Who would do that ? With the destruction of this cocaine factory ... another battle has been won in the war against drugs . This is Captain McClaren , the mastermind of Operation Dustoff . [ Hearty Laughing ] Santiago Caribe . Private reserve . You have to know somebody to get ahold of one of these . [ Beeping ] Well ... I guess they really do know somebody . All right . [ Clears Throat ] Let 's move this along . - Next ! - Private First Class Mark S. Clements . [ Beckwith ] Miss Clements , I assume you have new light to shed on this matter . Yes , I do . Um , a corporal in the 185th Division - Sorry . You were saying ? It 's about Duke , the man referred to in my father 's letter . This Duke , um , is he here to testify ? I wasn 't able to find him , sir , but my father was not a traitor . - Can I have some water , please ? - If you would please listen - Miss Clements , have you any new light to shed on this matter ? No , sir , but as I was saying , if you could just give me a little bit more time - - I 'm sorry . - But you haven 't let me explain . - What 's next ? - Why won 't you people listen to me ? Barney . Miss Clements , I 'm sorry to have to tell you this ... but to be perfectly blunt ... your father 's name will never go up on that wall . Now , please , we have other matters to address . [ Woman ] We will now hear from Congressman Hutchinson ... regarding Private First Class Jonas Drake ... whose recent passing has been attributed to exposure to Agent Orange . [ Quiet Sobbing ] You 're giving up ? I 'm - I 'm facing the facts . Maybe I can 't find Duke because there is no Duke . And maybe the reason I can 't find any evidence in my father 's defense ... is ' cause it doesn 't exist . And maybe it doesn 't exist because ... my father was - When I was little , I was taken from my family . I don 't know who they are ... who my father is . All I have is this . It 's the only connection that I have to him . But I 'll never give up searching for him ... for my family . Don 't give up on your family . I don 't have the strength ... to do this alone anymore . You 're not alone . [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosions ] They have been awake for over 90 hours . [ Sighs ] Yeah , in the same room with you , that is a record . Sydney , you gotta help me out with this kid , take her off my hands . Have her sim something . I don 't care . [ Chuckles ] She 's only a child . She doesn 't listen . She 's always in my things . I can 't even take a step without her nipping at my heels . She 's like a Chihuahua . This is about her finding your mother 's gift , isn 't it ? Broots called . He feels very concerned about his daughter 's well-being . Well , it 's time he started showing a little concern about mine . She delights in annoying me . Debbie 's not trying to annoy you . Debbie 's trying to be like you . She unconsciously senses that you both share ... a similarity of maternal abandonment . Are you even capable of having a normal conversation ? It 's her adaptive coping mechanism . She senses how you came through it ... and it gives her hope that she , too , someday ... may come through it ... which is why you need to let this relationship flourish . You know , it would be really nice if once ... you could take my side on something . It 's not about sides , Parker . It 's about the best interests of the child . By projecting your anger on little Debbie ... you 've displaced the anger with yourself as a little girl . And what am I so angry about , Dr. Spock ? It 's that you feel responsible for your mother 's death . - [ Woman Singing . Opera ] - [ Explosion ] - Leave me alone . ! - Mama ! No ! [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Mama . ! No . ! Stop . ! Mama , please ! No ! [ Echoing ] Please , no . ! Mama , no ! No , Mama ! Let me go ! [ Echoing ] No , Mama . ! Let me go . ! Let go ! No ! No , Mama ! [ Screaming ] Please . ! Mama . ! Mama , no . ! Please , please , no . ! Mama . ! Please . ! No . ! Let me go ! Mama ! Mama ! Let me go ! [ Continues ] Now , remember , this is only a rough cut . - [ Beeping ] - You want to be rich ? You want big house , fast car ? Beautiful girls ? Course you do . I watch Mark die . Mark was my friend . - What the hell is going on ? - My friend - die - die . I watch-my friend - die . Mark was my friend . I watch - I watch - I watch-my friend - die . Uh-oh . Technical difficulties . - Who the hell are you ? - Someone who wants to know the truth . Why did you corroborate his story ? Did McClaren threaten to kill you or your family ? You don 't know what you 're talking about . I know he and Stanfield are tipping off a drug lord about raids in exchange for cash . If they 're doing it now , they were doing it back then . - You don 't know what you 're asking me to do . - I understand why you lied . You were just a little boy . McClaren offers you freedom from the atrocities of war . You back his story on national TV ... and he puts you and your family on a boat to the States . It was a plane . - What ? - McClaren helped my family escape on a plane . I only said it was a boat in the commercials for dramatic effect . The war ended for you . Help me end it for Denise Clements . [ Sighs ] I was cleaning McClaren 's tent , and I saw some documents marked " classified . " I knew something wasn 't right , so I told Mark . He said he 'd have to catch McClaren in the act of passing the documents to the enemy ... before he could accuse him of treason ... so that night , we followed McClaren into a clearing ... just north of the camp , but - But it was a setup . McClaren knew that Clements was onto him and wanted him to follow ... because he had put land mines out there . Did Clements hear the click ... when he stepped on that toe popper ? Yeah , he heard a click , but it wasn 't Mark who stepped on the mine . You . Mark transferred his weight on to the pressure fuse ... so that I could move off . He took your place on the mine . That 's when McClaren stepped out of the jungle . He knew that Clements would never step off that mine . [ Rifle Cocks ] So he shot him . - [ Gunfire ] - But he didn 't die right away . McClaren watched him bleed to death . He planted the classified documents on him ... and made Clements look like the traitor . - I can still hear the click ... - [ Clicking Sound ] feel the heat of the explosion . [ Loud Explosion ] You think the war is over ? It 'll never be over for me . Excuse me , sir . This just arrived from Congressman Stanfield 's office . - Is everything all right , sir ? - Huh ? - Is everything all right , sir ? - Huh ? Yeah . You know , everything 's fine . I - I 'm sorry . I can come back later . No . Come in . Are you sure ? Sit here . Let 's do something with your hair , okay ? I 'm sorry that I got angry before . It 's just ... that present was given to me by my mother ... and no one has touched it but me ... for a very , very long time . Why haven 't you opened it ? I 'm not sure . [ Sighs ] I wanted to about a thousand times ... but , um ... it was just so perfect . The paper that she used and the way she tied the ribbon . So very much my mother . Your mommy died , didn 't she ? Yes . The day she gave me that present . I wouldn 't have opened it either . Why ? Because if you did ... there would never be anything else for your mommy to give you . I think it 's time . My mother loved this book . [ Voice Breaking ] She wanted to read it with me . " Little Women . ' " What 's it about ? A little girl named Jo . Was she happy ? [ Chuckles ] Let 's find out . Come on . " Chapter One : Playing Pilgrims . " " Christmas won 't be Christmas without any presents , ' grumbled Jo , lying on the rug . " [ Debbie , Overlapping ] " It 's so dreadful to be poor , ' sighed Meg , looking at her old dress . " " I don 't think it 's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things ... " and other girls nothing at all , ' added little Amy , with an injured sniff . " " We 've got Father and Mother and each other , ' said Beth contentedly from her corner . The four young faces on which the fire shone bright " - [ Sobbing ] " ... Jo said sadly ... " " We haven 't got Father and shall not have him for a long time . ' " She didn 't say perhaps never , but each silently added it ... thinking of Father far away where the fighting was . " [ McClaren ] Barney ? Barney ! Where the hell are you ? [ Clicking ] [ Jarod ] Uh-oh . That 's not a good sound . Jarod . Oh , thank God . Am I glad to see you . - You don 't look so good . - I am standing on a land mine . Well , I better go get someone who can disarm it . - How long can you stand there ? - As long as it takes . Well , I guess anyone could if they knew what would happen ... if they stepped off it . That must have been why you had to shoot Mark Clements off the one he was standing on . And that 's why I 'm going to have to shoot you . What the hell is going on here ? What really happened in Qui Nhon , Captain ? If I were you , I would talk to me ... or the next bullet might not be a blank . Army Intel suspected a traitor in our unit . So you killed Clements , and then you framed him . Intel had their man , and you and Stanfield , you were in the clear . - We did what we had to do . - You had a business to run . Selling secrets to the highest bidder . Tell me something , Captain . Is greed so addictive that you could kill an innocent man ? You couldn 'tjust kill him . You had to destroy him . You stripped him ofhis honor ... and you left his little girl another war to fight . It 's your word against mine . Nobody doubted me before . You really think anybody 's gonna doubt me now ? Thanks to these helmet cams , it 's not just my words , it 's yours too . Damn it , Lieutenant . You disarm this mine now ! - I am your commanding officer ! - Not technically . You see , I 'm not really in the army . But if it makes you feel any better ... I won 't shoot you in the leg like you shot Clements . I 'll aim ... higher . No . - No . - [ Gunshot ] [ Explosions ] Don 't wet your pants , sir . It 's Jell-O . It 's a dessert . Yummy . Hello ? [ Nervous Chuckle ] [ Wheezy Chuckle ] What , uh , happened to you ? Well - We went shopping . Do you have a problem with that ? Honey ? Why don 't you gather up your stuff , and we 'll leave Miss Parker to her business ? She 's a good kid . Always take care of her ... or I will hunt you down and kill you . - Understand ? - I think so . You read it all . Promise ? I promise . Come on , kiddo . [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ]

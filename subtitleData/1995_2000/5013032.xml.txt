 All I want is a regular life . Go to a ballgame , see a movie . Is that too much to ask ? I don 't know . Is it ? Well , no , it 's not . But I can 't because of the paper . It 's the paper 's fault . Right . You have no choice . No , I don 't . You read the newspaper in the morning , and then feel compelled to go out and help the people you 've read about . Well , you-you see , it 's not a typical paper . It 's-it 's kind of hard to explain . I mean , you-you might think I was crazy , unless , of course , you ... you think I 'm crazy already . I had a patient once who thought his dog told him what to do . In that case ... It 's-it 's a cat . Excuse me ? Well , the cat comes with the paper . Or the ... paper comes with the cat . You see , I-I-I 'm not quite sure which . Well , in the short term , Gary , my advice is , um ... stop reading the newspaper . Well , I can 't do that . I - I-I just can 't ... Pick a day . How about , um , how about Sunday ? Slowest news day of the week . Can you stop reading the Sunday paper ? Stop reading the Sunday paper . That a boy . Now , I want to see you three times a week . I have , um ... Mondays at 11 : 30 , or 3 : 15 . And , uh Wednesdays at , uh , 4 : 00 . Hey ! Hey ! Good morning . Gesundheit . What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * Forget it , pal . I didn 't order these . Somebody did . These are the ugliest wine glasses I 've ever seen . You 'd have to be blind to order something like this . I 'm sorry , you gotta take these back . Morning , Chuck . My new stemware come in yet ? Your new stemware ? Yeah . I ordered it last week . Since when do you order anything without telling me ? Since Gary put me in charge of inventory . Oh , he did ? Yeah . Well , he didn 't tell me . Well , he did . Well , he shouldn 't . Well , he did . Well , he shouldn 't . Gary , excuse me , did you tell her she could order new wine glasses ? Remember last week ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I - I-I-I might have done that . Oh , thanks for telling me . Oh , oh , yeah , you 're welcome . What 's wrong with you ? Hmm ? Oh , nothing . You-you know what ? I don 't have much of a life , do I ? I mean , I get up in the mornings and I get the paper , and then I go out and I do what the paper tells me to do , and then I come back , and then I go to bed , and then I get up the next morning , I do the same thing all over again , don 't I ? I hate to tell you this , pal , but you didn 't have much of a life before you started getting that paper . You know what ? This morning , I-I thought I heard the cat speak to me . The cat ? Yeah . But it wasn 't . It was a psychiatrist . Psychiatrist ? Well , in-in the dream . Ah . Hey , you know , he had some pretty darn good things to say to me . The cat ? No , the psychiatrist . He told me that I should take Sundays off from the paper . And that I should rest . And-and then I got to thinking , well , maybe we should take Sundays and have a brunch here at the bar when the Bears play . Just like old McGinty used to do . That goes completely against our marketing strategy , Gare . Yeah , but it would make my whole life a whole lot better . Oh . Well , if that 's what you need to do , then that 's what we 'll do , Gary . Well , good . That 's wonderful . Then that ... that 's what we 'll do . Where you going ? Me ? Oh , I 'm - I 'm-I 'm going over to St. John 's Hospital . There 's a ... a sleep-deprived surgical resident who is about to take someone 's kidney out , but it 's the wrong kidney . It 's the usual . Wait a minute . We 've got some unfinished business here . Oh , I 'm sure you can take care of it . No . We can 't take care of it . Just wait a second . Now , Marissa here is ordering wine glasses out of a Salvador Dali catalogue . Excuse me ? And she tells me that you put her in charge of inventory . Now , is that true , or what ? I need to know these things . You know what I 'd really like the both of you to think about ... is Sunday , and the Bears game , and brunch . Third-and-six for the Bears . Under a minute remaining . He 's gonna have to throw , Pat . Hut , hut ... There 's the snap . Damski has a man over the middle . He 's got it . First down Bears on the Dolphins 40 . That 's five in a row for Damski . I love you , Joe . Here 's the replay . This guy 's amazing . Quick release . Eight yard pick up . What a performance by Regular Joe Damski . 275 yards in the air , three touchdown passes , and now Damski puts the Bears in a position to win it with just under 30 seconds to play . I 'm here , Joe . I 'm here . I 'm here , too , Joe . I 'm here , too . Oh , but he 's married . I don 't care . Whoever she is , I 'll share . Well , you just can 't say enough about the guy . I mean , he comes out of retirement , and plays like he never missed a snap . You know , Damski 's turned this entire team around . Hey , Butkus , for your information , there are ten other players on the field like my husband . Her man deserves all the credit . I mean , where were we without Joe ? Amen . You strut all you want to , girl . That man of yours is one delectable piece of pie . You go , Joe . I can 't take it , Gare . The Bears win , right ? You can tell me . I told you , I don 't know . I 'm not reading the paper . 18 seconds to play . Bears trailing by five , as Damski comes to the line . Another barn burner for the Bear fans . But I guess they 've come to expect it . ... really gotta tell me what 's gonna happen . Damski 's forced out of the pocket , eludes one tackler . Get rid of it , Joe . Still on his feet . He has a man in the corner - and Ford , now on the ten , on the five , touchdown Bears . Bears win ! Bears win ! Unbelievable ! Damski does it again . * We 're in the money * And Damski 's slow getting up , Dick . Man , I-I 'm afraid he 's not getting up at all . I hope it 's not another concussion . He 's had enough of those . All right , here 's the replay . See what happens ? He waits till the last second before he got rid of it . He 'll remember that one . All of Chicago is holding its breath right now , I can tell you that . Wait a minute . He 's moving now . And Damski 's up . Now , there 's a Chicago Bear . Somewhere you gotta believe George Halas is smiling right now . Somewhere you gotta believe ... He 's gonna be fine , honey . He 'll be just fine . Look at him , waving and everything . Hey , Joe . Hey , baby . You know , I 'll tell you something . I feel good . Yeah ? You want to know why you feel good ? 'Cause the Bears won . No , not only because the Bears won . Hey , Gare , great game . Just like old times . You feel good , my friend , because you didn 't do a good deed today . For once , you acted totally selfishly , just like every other red-blooded American . And I 'm proud of you . Cheers . Excuse me . You felt guilty . Yeah . You were enjoying yourself . Well , yeah ... No , well , it 's because I didn 't read the paper . And did the world fall apart ? Well , no , it didn 't , but I felt I should have been doing something , or-or helping someone . Should , could . This compulsion of yours to do good , this leads to craziness . You know that , don 't you ? Do you think that it 's crazy to want to help someone ? To help your friends on occasion , people you know , that 's healthy . But to feel that you must help total strangers all the time , now that 's madness . Yeah , but the paper ... Oh , enough with the paper . This paper is making a nutcase out of you . You know what the real issue is ? Avoidance . Avoidance of what ? You tell me . What is it within you makes you so afraid that you think exclusively about others , ignoring your own needs ? You say you want to be a regular Joe . But you won 't let yourself be a regular Joe . You must see the contradiction in that . Gary ? We do not need embossed matchbooks . We do if we 're gonna have a cigar room . And whose idea was that ? Mine . Really ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . Gary , you tell him that there is no smoking in my restaurant . Your restaurant ? Now it 's your restaurant ? I think it 's more my restaurant , if anything , than your restaurant . Hey , keep it down , would you ? Now I thought it was our restaurant , the three of us . What are you talking about ? Gary , listen to me . It was never supposed to be the three of us . It was supposed to be you and me . Well , I can 't take it anymore . I will not work with this woman . Either she goes , or I go . All right , now , listen ... No , I mean it . Marissa ... Fine . Working with this turkey 's too hard for anyone . Even my dog can 't stand him . See what I mean ? Beneath that angelic facade is a cauldron of boiling hostility . All right , now wait a second . We can work this out together . No , we can 't work this out . You 're so busy running around trying to save the world , that you don 't even see what 's going on underneath your own nose . She says tomato , I say tomahto . She says potato , I say potahto . You get the picture ? I can 't take it anymore . I 've had it . Now , what 's it gonna be , Gare , her or me ? Well , I ... Now , listen ... Thanks a lot for your vote of confidence , pal . Huh ? I 'm out of here . Now , wait a second , Chuck ... Forget it . I quit . You 're gonna go after him , aren 't you ? No , I 'm not going after him . I 'll let him cool down a little bit . I 'll let him just be , uh , Chuck . Look , Gary , I-I 'm sorry . Maybe I shouldn 't ... No , no , no , no , it 's-it 's not your fault . It 's-it 's-it 's my fault . As much as I hate to admit it , maybe he 's right . I haven 't been paying enough attention to this place . I haven 't even been able to pay enough attention to my life because of this . Because of this . Because of this paper , huh ? Hi . Can I get a table for two ? Sure . Follow me . Something private would be great . How does this look for you ? " Bears quarterback sued for divorce . " What ... ? Thanks . Mm-hmm . Oh , I think I 'm gonna wait for my husband . All right . Mm-hmm . Thank you . This compulsion of yours to do good , this leads to craziness . You know that , don 't you ? To feel that you must help total strangers all the time , now that 's madness . Gary ? Huh ? Gary , what 's going on ? Uh ... This paper 's making a nutcase out of you . Excuse me a minute , would you ? Excuse me . Hmm . My name is Gary Hobson . I - I run this place . Are you okay ? Oh , I 'll be fine . Thanks . Because if you 're not , you could use my office to powder your nose , or ... Thanks . Um , that 'd be great , actually . Uh , here you are . Thank you . Aren 't you , uh ... Colleen Damski . Yeah . I 've , uh , I 've followed your husband 's career . Actually , I 'm supposed to meet him here in a few minutes . He 's coming here ? Yeah . But I 'm afraid it 's not such a happy occasion . Uh , please sit down , Ms. Damski . Thanks . Uh ... Is-is there anything that I can do for you ? Well , not unless you 're a marriage counselor . No , I 'm not . Well , that 's too bad , ' cause these are my divorce papers . I 'm very sorry to hear that . Yeah , me , too . When Joe and I first got married , he was out of the game . He promised that we were gonna settle down and start a family and lead a normal life , but Joe just can 't stay away from football . Well , he 's-he 's a great quarterback . Yeah . Everybody says that . He acts like he 's a big kid . Uh , yeah . But he 's 37 years old . And he has had concussions , and he has a bad back , and he has bad knees , and he is out there being chased by 300-pound linemen who can run a five-four 40 . I mean , how long do you think that his body can take that kind of punishment ? Uh ... I 'm sorry . Well , I-I was divorced . And-and I gotta tell you something . You know , I hate to see it when-when people give up when they 're still in love . And it seems to me it sounds like you 're still in love with your husband . And I-I don 't know Mr. Damski personally , of course , but ... well , if you leave your husband , it seems to me you would force him back into playing football , which is exactly what you don 't want him to do . And if you did that , well , he 'd have nothing else in his life . Well , I 'm hardly in his life right now . Well , maybe he doesn 't see it that way . Maybe he doesn 't know exactly what 's going on , what with everything going on . And that , uh , he doesn 't know exactly how to deal with it . I don 't know . Uh ... Great . Thank you . Colleen . You 're welcome . They said you were back here . Hi , Joe . Hey . Joe , this is , um , Gary . This is his place . How do you do ? Fine . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you . Hi , Joe . Hi . What 's your name ? Robin . Robin , uh , why-why don 't you get the Damski 's another table , in the back , in a private area . No problem . This way . Thank you for the information , Gary . Maybe I can just , uh , talk to you about this later . Well , sure . That would-that would be fine . Nice to meet you . Yeah . You , too . You know , I 'm your biggest fan . I even liked you when you played for the Vikings . Oh . My brothers wanted to kill me , but I didn 't care . It 's a shame Chuck 's not here to see this . Regular Joe Damski at McGinty 's . There you go , Jimmy . Thanks . You 're welcome . Take care . Oh . Uh , if you can make it out to Chuck . Wait a minute , I know you . You 're the guy from the restaurant . Larry . Uh ... Gary . Whatever . Who 's Chuck ? Uh , Chuck 's my business partner over at the restaurant . Wow , this ball looks like it 's had some use . Yeah . You ever play ? A little bit . A little high school , a little less college . A wide receiver , mostly . Really ? Let 's see what you got . Huh ? Shotgun formation , square out to the right . Let 's go . Well , I ... Second sound , let 's go . Hut ! Whoa . Hey ! Hey , that 's not bad . Yeah , well , I , uh , I played a little quarterback . Very little . Did you ever think about the pros ? No . That 's all I ever thought about . You got a pen ? Oh , uh ... Your , uh , your wife mentioned that . My wife ? Well , at the-at the restaurant , we were talking about football and yourself . Oh . She say anything else ? No . No . Oh . Well , here you go . Uh , well ... well , thanks . I gotta hop a bus back to work . All right . Take care . Thank you . Yeah . Hey , you want a lift ? No ! I couldn 't do that . I ... Go on , hop in . I 'll give you a ride . All right . So , uh , so she was upset , huh ? What ? Colleen . Oh , well , I think she was , uh , concerned , yeah . She wants me to quit . You believe that ? She thinks I 've had my bell rung too many times . She 's probably right , too , you know . I can hear a few screws rattling around up in there . Damn concussions . Uh , she did mention something about symptoms . She 's , uh .. Oh , I get names mixed up occasionally , but everybody does . You know , I had a friend in college , he , uh , got hit in the first quarter - concussion . Played the rest of the game . Afterwards , he didn 't-he didn 't remember a thing about the whole game . Doc told him if he got , uh , hit again , it 'd kill him . So , what did he do ? Oh , he quit . He 's got a , uh , computer company now , and a wife and kid . I keep in touch with him . Well , to each his own , I guess , huh ? So I understand that you had quit originally because of the injuries . Oh , that and Colleen . I was tired . She was beautiful . Like an angel . She convinced me that I could get over football , you know , and , well , I believed her for a little while . So-so what made you change your mind ? Well , it 's not the money , you know . I got plenty of that . You know what it 's like to trot out in the field with the game on the line , you got millions of fans waiting for you to pull off another miracle ? Well , I 'll tell you something , Harry ... Gary . At that moment , at that very second , you just feel like you 're gonna live forever . I don 't know , I 'm-I 'm nothing without a football in my hands . Well , I 'm sure your wife doesn 't feel that way . Colleen is the best thing that ever happened to me , and I know that . But you saw me out there the other day . We could go to the play-offs . And I 'm just not ready to quit . That 's all . I mean , I know I have to someday . Just not today . Schmuck . Been almost a week , and you still feel like a schmuck , don 't you ? Yeah . It 's a complicated world , kiddo . You tried to help Colleen and Joe . What more could you do ? But-but they-they still love each other . You want a headline ? I 'll give you a headline . Love does not conquer all . They 're adults . You 're an adult . Live your life . I - I 'm trying . Well , try harder . Look what this compulsion 's already cost you . Your peace of mind . Your best friend . What 's next ? You 're right . What are you gonna do about it ? Well , I 'm-I 'm gonna stick to the plan , and I 'm-I 'm gonna stay away from the paper on Sunday . I 'm gonna watch the Bears ' game . Good . And whatever it says , ignore the paper . Do nothing . Nothing ? Well , come on in . Do nothing . It 's Sunday . I get a break . Heh . Welcome to historic Soldier Field , on the shores of Lake Michigan . This stadium , well , it 's seen a lot of great sporting events in its time , but none more unexpected than the football game about to be played here today . Do you believe in miracles ? Join us as the fairy tale continues for the city of Chicago , where their beloved Bears take on the Washington Redskins . Hey ! Game day , huh ? Hey , Mike . Hey , how are you ? Good . How are you ? ... 37 years old , retires from chronic injuries , then comes out of the mothballs to play in , well , Super Bowl form . Well , now , of course , Joe can 't scramble like he used to on those banged up knees , but I 'll tell you something , he still gets plenty of zip out of them . It 's been a long time since the Bears were playing with so much at stake . Too long . This is a city that 's starved for some postseason play . Lenny , man , where are you ? I thought you were coming over . Well , uh , how about the second half ? But I 'll tell you something else about this Redskins team . They 're smart , they 're physical , Yeah , sure . and Terry Allen may have one of the premier running backs Whatever . Okay . Bye-bye . in the game . Redskins won the toss , and here comes the kick . And we 're under way . A long , high kick . Redskins try to run it right up the middle . Big mistake , Pat . There was no seam there . All right ! You see that tackle ? You know , the trick is to stop this great kick returner specialist before they get up a head of steam . You okay ? Of course I 'm okay . I got the Bears , I got my Bloody Mary , I got a brunch . What more could I want ? Uh-huh . Chuck 's not here - that 's his decision . I 'm not reading the paper today - that 's my decision . Sunday 's my day . I 'm gonna enjoy my day , even if it kills me . Come on , Bears ! 24-17 , Redskins , in the second quarter . We 're under two minutes now . The Bears trail by seven . And this is where Damski really shines - the two minute drill . The Bears come to the line - Come on , Joe . Damski in the pocket . And he has a man to the right . It 's Fuller . First down , Bears on the Washington 17 , a 20-yard pick up . Man , did he drill that one . I mean , that 's what you call a frozen rope . Another huge first down for the Bears . Joe Damski has just gone over the 200-yard mark in passing . What the ... ? Psst . Go on , get out of here ! Mario , clean it up . But the game ... I told you ten minutes ago to take out those coffee grounds . Move . Paper towels cost money , Mario . Get some newspaper . Damski would love to tie this thing up before halftime . Rush in motion . Damski takes a short drop , fires off his back foot . Touchdown , Bears ! Here comes Masello for the extra point . Look out . The Bears' placekicking stinks . Why Stan 's putting his faith in Masello , and to be honest , I don 't understand ... Come on , Masello . 24 , 23 and Masello lines up for the kick . Here we go . And it 's ... no good ! You stink , Masello ! I could kick better than you ! You gotta wonder what 's going through Masello 's mind right now . I 'm going to the kitchen . I could kick better than that guy . You want to know something , Pat ? I could kick better than that guy . Mario , you 're leaking all over the place ! I don 't believe it . I don 't believe it ! Mario ... Both teams have come out flat in the second half . You can see Joe Damski trying to get the crowd back into it . He comes to the line of scrimmage . Third and eight . It 's a little late . All right , the Redskins are definitely looking pass here . Here 's the snap . Play action . It 's a screen . What do you want ? I 'm watching the game ! Look ! What , did the cat have a bladder problem ? Joe 's gonna get hit with 12 seconds left in the game . He 's gonna go into a coma . We gotta do something about it . What do you mean we , kemosabe ? Look , I need your help . Oh , this is so typical . Suddenly you need my help . Where before I 'm nothing but a pain in the butt , now you can 't do it without me , huh ? Now , listen ... You got to admit , I have a point . No , I gotta admit , I 'm gonna strangle you in a few seconds . All I 'm asking for is a little respect . R - E-S-P-E-C-T , find out what it means to me . You through ? Not quite . The second half 's just begun . Now , we don 't have much time here . Will you help me ? Pat O 'Brien , along with Dick Butkus . After an explosive first half , neither team has been able to put points up on that board . Well , both defenses have tightened it up . Especially the Redskins secondary . And you know , it looks to me like the Bears ' offensive line is beginning to tire . Joe 's gonna have to scramble , and on those bad knees , that could be a problem . This game 's been sold out for weeks , Gare . How we gonna get in there ? Well , we 'll just have to think of something . Uh , I don 't know , my connections have all dried up . What ? I know . I can 't breathe in this thing ! Come on , just keep walking . All right . But I am not doing this for you . I 'm doing this for the city of Chicago . My trainer . How you doing ? Oxygen . I need oxygen . I don 't think this guy 's bathed in months . All right , we 're in . Yeah . You , me and 60,000 screaming fans . Now what ? We punt . Just under eight minutes , Bears trail by one and fans are looking to Damski for another miracle finish . Come on , we 're gonna stop Joe . What do you want us to do ? Go out on the field and tackle him ? Here 's the snap . Damski dumps it off for maybe a three yard gain . Look , it says here he 's brought down to the locker room with five minutes to play to have his leg checked out , then he comes back up top . That 's when he 's hurt . So , come on . Wait ! Where are you going ? I 'm going down to the locker room . And how do you expect us to get into the locker room ? The same way we got into the stadium . Oh , no . I 'm not putting this thing on again . It stinks . I 've had it . Hey ! Come on , Smokey . I 'm breathing noxious fumes in here ! Five minutes on the clock now , and ticking down , and the Bears ' offense continues to struggle . Damski drops back . Whoa ! You 've gotta pick up that blitz . He 's down . Damski 's brought down for a six yard loss , and appears to be hurt , Dick . You know , it 's his left knee . I mean , it 's been bothering him the whole half . Talk about a bad break for the Bears . Down a point with five minutes to go . You gotta wonder how many more games those knees can take ? I mean , after all , he 's had operations on both of them . The hopes of Chicago are riding on those knees right now . Okay , let 's take a look , Joe . Ah , wait a second . Wait a second . Ah , man . Look , it 's just a bruise . We don 't have a prayer without Joe . He 'll be back . What happened to Gary ? Couldn 't take the suspense ? I have no idea where he is . That should give you enough support . Great . Let me get out of here . Whoa . Redskins ball . Take your time . Hey , I don 't like the way that brace is riding . Sit back down here . I 'm going to make a couple adjustments . Okay , try that out . That feel any better ? Joe ? Colleen ? You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Is he fine , Jack ? Still in one piece . Great . Tell ' em I 'm on my way , would you , Doc ? Thanks . Colleen , I can 't have you coming down here , okay ? I 'll talk to you after the game . No , you won 't , Joe . What ? I can 't do this anymore . What ? I never wanted to come between you and football , and I didn 't think that I had to . But it is very clear what you are married to , and it is not me . Colleen , this is not the time to have this discussion . You are not the only one who 's getting hurt out there , Joe . I mean , you have no idea what I feel every time you put on that uniform . And I love you . I love you too much to watch you get crippled , Joe . So you go out there , and you win one for the Bears . And I will read about it in tomorrow 's paper . Colleen , wait . ... Peroth back on the field , third in inches . Redskins leading by one with under four minutes remaining . Peroth takes the snap , and he passes over the middle . First down , Redskins . Didn 't I tell you ? Look out for pass . Wait a minute . There 's a flag on the play . Holding , Redskins . Whoo ! That 's a huge break for the Bears . The first and ten is now third and eleven . Hey , Joe . Joe , hey . Whoa , whoa , hey . How you doing ? I 'm a big fan of yours . How did you get in here ? Oh , we 're just maintenance crew . We 're checking on the ... What ? The whirlpools ... Listen , I gotta go ... Hey , Joe . They stuffed ' em , Pat . The Redskins will have to punt it away . The Bears will have one more chance . Now , the question is , where 's Damski ? Joe ? Joe , where are you ? Joe , we need you . Masello . Masello ! Who the hell are you ? ! I 'm your worst nightmare ! Gare , anytime ! All right . Get him off me . What are you thinking ? ! It 's Masello , the placekicker . I hate that guy . Oh . Oh , let 's get him out of here . Come on ... Punk . Someone 's coming . Close the door . Lock it ! Hey , Joe , is that you ? Hey , Joe , open up ! Uh ... it 's stuck . Who 's this ? Security . Where 's Joe ? Uh , he 's , um ... call of nature . Well , listen , we got the ball back . We need him . He 's coming right out . He just said be patient for a sec , you know . He 's human . Hey , who is this ? Come on , open up ! I 'm gonna go call somebody . Oh , no , no . Oh , yes . Oh , no . Uh , listen , in another minute , they 're gonna force this door down , and they 're gonna see you and me and two chloroformed Bear players . It 's your call , buddy . One foot in front of the other . All right . What 's the worst thing that can happen , huh ? You take the snap , you get flattened , an ambulance comes , and then , uh ... Just remember , Gare , there are 20 million Bears fans counting on you . All right ? Let me do all the talking . Keep your mouth shut . Hey , look , here 's Joe ! Joe , thank God . Hey , what 's with the visor ? Uh , he had eye problems - cornea , it 's his cornea . How come he can 't talk ? He , uh , broke his jaw , too . His jaw 's wired shut . His jaw ? I thought it was his knee . You know , the jaw bone 's connected to the knee bone 's connected to the eye socket 's connected ... Yeah , yeah , yeah . Can 't call plays , huh ? Conklin , get over here ! Joe ! Joe can 't talk . You gotta call the snap for him . Uh , 93 , wide cross . Go . Now , you got it ? Go , go . Get it done . Listen to that crowd , Dick . Damski 's back , and so are the Bears ' chances . I told ya . Couldn 't have put it better myself . Well , whatever they did to him in the locker room , Damski doesn 't even look like the same player . Well , he 's got a knee brace on his left knee , and a-and a visor , which I 've never seen before . There 's a report now from the field that he has a scratched cornea and a broken jaw . And he 's still out there . Unbelievable . You gotta love a guy like that . 14 seconds left . Ball on the Redskins ' 40 . No time outs . Well , that would be a record kick for a good placekicker , and unfortunately , the Bears don 't have a good kicker . So , it 's all on Damski 's shoulders , as the Bears break from the huddle . Shotgun formation , Fuller split left . And the crowd 's on its feet . This is it . The entire season on the line . If the Bears win , they 're in the play-offs . If they lose , it 's wait till next year . Damski seems confused , Pat . That injury may have shook him up more than we know . Conklin 's calling the signals . Very long count . Play clock down to three seconds . Come on , come on , snap the ball , will ya ? * And Fuller has it . Makes a great move on Curtis , and it 's a footrace for the sideline . First down at the six , a 34-yard play . Hold it , Pat . Damski 's hurt . Damski 's not moving , and there 's a flag on the field . Here 's the replay . Joe rolls right , avoids the tackle , but Rass keeps after him - and down he goes . After he released the ball , Pat . I mean , that 's definitely roughing the passer . Look at his head snap back . Man , I hate to see that . Excuse me . Excuse me . That was nasty , huh ? Hey , you okay ? Huh ? Hey , Joe ? Speak to me . Hey , shake it off , Joe . He 's moving . No , no ! Don 't touch his helmet ! He 's right . Don 't move his head . Is he all right ? Get a stretcher in here . Hey , get a stretcher ! All right , easy , watch it . We love you , Joe ! Put him down . One , two , three ... You 'll , be all right , man . You 're gonna be all right , buddy . We 're with you , Joe . All right , Joe . Watch his head . Shake it off ! Masello ! Hey , Masello ? Masello ? Come on . Yeah , you . Remember , we got a game to win . Huh ? Come on ! Four seconds on the clock . Ball on the Redskins ' six . It all comes down to the foot of kicker Tony Masello . Stay with him . I want to check on the X-ray unit . Masello 's missed one extra point already today . You know something ? I hate kickers . I mean , you spend 59 minutes in a war , and then it all comes down to a skinny kid who grew up playing soccer . We will keep you updated on Damski 's condition as soon as we get anything . In the meantime , we 've still got a one point game down on the field . Four seconds left . This is it . Masello 's coming on for what will be a 23-yard field goal attempt . This would be an automatic for most kickers . Kiss this one good-bye . We 're doomed . Have faith . He stinks . Yeah , but Masello isn 't most kickers . I mean , look at the guy , Pat . Look at the crowd . I 've never heard them so quiet . Well , the hopes and dreams of an entire city are riding on this kick . Well , you 're right about that . We 're talking about three points that 'll spell the difference between disaster and triumph . It 's good ! The Bears win ! I don 't believe it ! It 's good . The Bears win . I don 't believe it . The ball bounced off a Redskins ' helmet , hit the right upright , and somehow got through . I don 't believe it . Joe ? Joe , are you all right ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm just ... I 'm just ... I 'm just a little woozy , that 's all . But I 'm ready to play , coach . Masello ? Send-send me in , coach . If you 're in here , then who 's out there ? Hey , what up ? How you doing ? I 'm freezing . Put this on . Can we go now ? Yeah . Pretty great kick , huh ? Tell us about that last drive , Joe . Well , to tell you the truth , Dick , I don 't remember too much . I 've , uh , I 've seen the replay . Doesn 't seem to be me out there . And that made me realize something . I mean , I love this game . It 's all I 've ever known . Hey , Bob . But I think there comes a time in every athlete 's life where he has to face the fact that he 's just ... just too old to play anymore . And that time is now . Frankly , life without football scares the hell out of me . But a future without my health ... and my wonderful wife , Colleen , boy , that scares me a lot more . So , I 'd like to thank the Bears and the city of Chicago . They 're the greatest fans in the world . And I 'll be cheering with you all the way to the Super Bowl . Good-bye . Good luck , Joe . Well , Pat , Regular Joe just dropped another bomb . But you know something ? I think this retirement is for good . Back to you , Pat . I love you . I love you , too . Quarterback Regular Joe Damski shocked the fans here in Chicago by announcing his retirement . Damski brought the team from the cellar all the way to the play-offs . He left the game as he arrived - a class act , a leader by example ... Hup . What is this ? That 's ... it 's a , uh ... peace offering . " To Chuck , Regular Joe Damski . " Hey , you think you can buy my love with a football ? So , you need my help at McGinty 's , huh ? Look ... you belong there . And Marissa ? Well , she 's part of the team , too . She doesn 't know anything about running a restaurant . Well , that 's another thing . It 's not gonna be a restaurant anymore . We 're gonna turn it back into the tavern that it used to be . And no more fancy wine glasses , no more cigar rooms . You gonna be around this time ? Well , as much as I can . I still gotta deal with the paper . What about Sundays ? Even the big guy upstairs rests on Sundays . Well , hey , look what almost happened today . I thought you wanted your life back . Well , I 've been thinking ... Maybe this is my life . And-and maybe if ... maybe if I didn 't get the paper , I 'd ... I 'd still be helping people . That 's you , Gare , always looking out for number two . Maybe . Well , anyway , the fact of the matter is that , you know , I - I-I don 't ... I don 't need much to make me happy , Chuck . And , you know , a place to call home , and friends to share it with . I mean , what do you say ? Partners ? We need cocktail napkins . Right . Say no more . Chuck , you 're a whirlwind . Got to stay on top . Business is up 40 % since I convinced Gary to turn this place back into a sports bar . You convinced Gary to ... ? That 's right . I gotta go . I 'm busy . Busy like a little beaver . Fishman to Hobson . Take care of those , buddy . Sissy , make sure all the tables have pretzels , okay ? Damian , this one ... Get him out of here . What 's with Chuck ? It 's like he 's-he 's a whole new , uh , Chuck . Not entirely . Gesundheit . You know ... I love what you 're doing with the place . You made the right choice , Gary . Always listen to your heart . It 's what 's in here that counts . Good luck . Thank you . Do you know that man , Gary ? I - I-I don 't know if I do or not .

 [ RECORD PLAYS ] [ EXPLOSIONS ] [ GUNS SHOOTING ] [ MEN YELLING IN DISTANCE ] Three , two , one ... [ TEAPOT WHISTLING ] Grenade . HOBBES : A world exists exactly like ours . You live in this world . Your family and friends . And though you may not know it , I was sent to save you . It 's just a game . HOBBES : My dear Sophie , it 's October now , or maybe November . And still we 're no closer to our goal : To kill Santiago and end the game . We 're in this godforsaken place looking for a man a military assassin , who may hold the key . Whether fate or my own conscious choice has led me down this road I cannot say . I only hope that I will be up to the task ahead . Knowing in my heart that all roads lead to you . HOBBES : We 're lost , aren 't we ? - We 're not lost . Five klicks south of Levittown is where that GI in the bar said we 'd find him . PINOCCHIO : I know what he said . - Then what 's the problem ? The problem , genius , is we are five klicks south of Levittown . I traded an ammo clip to go on some snipe hunt . Thought you said you knew this Captain Wolff . Knew of him . He was one of the first assassins sent into the game . Topnotch triggerman . - Hey , where you going ? - There 's something over here . [ DEXTER BARKS ] Wolff ? They say he penetrated security , got off a shot at Santiago . Missed him by inches . - What happened ? - Disappeared right after that . Thought he was dead until we ran into that GI . [ DEXTER BARKING ] Dexter . Keep an eye on the car . I 'll bring him back . Dexter . Hey , boy . Dexter ! Little rat 's probably an appetizer by now . Here , doggy . Here , doggy . Where are you , you mangy little mutt ? What the hell was that ? Software glitch ? No , something else . [ DEXTER BARKS ] HOBBES : There you are . Where 'd you run off to , boy ? Dex , where 'd you get to , boy ? Can we go now ? Hey , where 's your car ? Florence ? Somebody is gonna die . [ GUN SHOOTING ] Sniper , 10 o 'clock . Got him . Circle around . I 'll draw fire . Now . [ SPEAKS IN GERMAN ] [ GUN SHOOTS ] MAN 1 : Clear ! MAN 2 : Bring the other one . MAN 1 : Search them . " Hobbes , Thomas F. " - He 's got American tags , lieutenant . - American ? You from the 84th ? - Eighty-fourth ? - As in the sorry-ass reinforcements we were expecting two weeks ago . No , we 're ... We 're from the 110th Infantry , out of Fort Dix . Nice try , only there ain 't no 110th . Don 't say another word , Hobbes . - I think we got a couple of spies . - Spies ? - Zip it . - I heard 24th Cav shot two krauts at a checkpoint , out of uniform and speaking English . - Just like these two mopes here . - All right , that 's enough . This area 's crawling with snipers . We stand here jawing we 're gonna get popped . Bring them along . Where the hell are we ? - Not now . - You saw what that sniper was wearing . Just keep your head on straight until we can figure something out . What are you looking at ? Been on this front a while , never seen you two . Yeah ? Well , take a good look because we 're getting out of here . You think so ? I know this place . Incoming ! MAN : Incoming ! [ EXPLOSIONS AND GUNS SHOOTING ] - I don 't believe this . - You believe that ? - First Platoon , cover right flank . - First Platoon , cover right flank ! - Pour fire down the middle of the bridge . MAN : Down the middle of the bridge ! What do want me to do with these two ? Get them out of here ! I 'll deal with them later . All right , you kraut bastards , move ! Now ! - Redistribute ammo . MAN : Redistribute ammo ! You touch me again , I 'll rip off that arm . Inside . PINOCCHIO : We 're not done yet . PINOCCHIO : Great . That 's all we need . We 're not gonna hurt you . It 's okay . He won 't bite . He 's a friend . They sure don 't make them like they used to . That bridge out there ... In OCS , we did a battle review of the Ardennes campaign , Second World War . There was a siege in Hotton , Belgium , between two small advance units of the German and American armies . It lasted over a month . - I swear that 's the same bridge . - It 's a combat sim . HOBBES : A what ? - Virtual combat simulation . When they beta-tested Harsh Realm , they used old battles : Pork Chop Hill , Pickett 's Charge . - So it 's another game . - It 's a battlefield trainer what Harsh Realm was originally designed for . - What 's it still doing here ? - Who knows ? Probably an oversight . Some pencil neck in the real world forgot to hit " delete . " [ DOOR UNLOCKS AND OPENS ] You two . With me . That 's far enough . Look , we 're not spies . Of course you 're not . You don 't even belong here . What are you , just deserters or on the run from Santiago ? - You know about Santiago ? - Hobbes . I saw what you did back there with the lieutenant . How 'd you know ? Poor bastards . You don 't even know what you 've gotten into , do you ? - We know this is a game . - You don 't know nothing . - Who told you to release the prisoners ? - Nobody . - Yeah , well , time 's up for these two . - Hey , your lieutenant said ... Lieutenant 's dead . That 's right , the lieutenant 's dead . Which puts me in charge of dealing with kraut spies . Wait . Take them out back . Make less of a mess . Hey you might wanna get down . Quit jerking around , private . [ GUN SHOOTS ] - Let 's get out of here . - I 'll be seeing you . - That 's where we came through , right ? - About half a klick more . - We must have looped around . - Come on , this way . [ GUNS SHOOTING ] You gotta be kidding me . It 's the same damn bridge . HOBBES : How do we get out of here ? Thirty-four days . That 's how long the siege lasts . Not a day more or less . So , what ? Then it starts all over again ? Day 25 , Germans launch a counteroffensive . Lieutenant dies in a firefight , leading to the brief but glorious command of Sergeant Curtis . New CO is Corporal Zink who buys the farm on day 28 , regular as clockwork . So , uh how do you get out ? - You don 't . Game space is about two miles square . You try to leave one side it pops you back in on another , like some damn Chinese box . - Did you try to find the jump port ? - What ? It 's an escape hatch built into the sims . It 's buried deep inside the code . - It could be anywhere : A rock , a tree . - Jump port 's nothing but a wet dream . I 've been over every square inch this side of the river . - What about the other side of the bridge ? - Mm-mm . It 's no man 's land . Germans hold the far bank . - Shoot on sight . CORPORAL : Hey , private . Private , what are you doing here ? Get your ass back on post . I got a better idea : Why don 't you . I think I gave you a direct order . And I think I told you to shove the order . - What 's your name , soldier ? - Sommer , Scott Eric . - That 's Sommer with an O. - Well , I 'll be writing you up for that . Better do it soon . Private Scott Sommer ? Or is it staff sergeant ? - Pinocchio . PINOCCHIO : Desert Storm al-Talil , Kuwait . Iraqi legs overran us because a Staff Sergeant Scott Sommers deserted his post . I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Let him go . - Why ? Four men died because of this rat . He knows the game . If there 's a way into this hole , there 's a way out . And you 're gonna help us . You got it ? What are you doing ? Go on home . Wouldn 't get too fond of him . Why not ? Look , I 've seen this play out 100 times . Kid hasn 't made it past day 28 once . - He 's here . - He 's just a game piece . He 's not like us . Sim resets them so they can come back and die again . [ MIMICS GUNSHOT ] - What if we win ? - What ? It 's a game , like Harsh Realm . We capture the bridge , we win we get out . - We can 't . Game won 't allow it . It 's designed so that nobody has a tactical advantage . Perfect stalemate . - I don 't buy it . There 's gotta be a way . - I 've been in this hole 18 months and I 'm telling you , no one 's gonna take that bridge . What if we blow it up ? - What ? - The bridge . - That 's crazy . HOBBES : Why ? The game 's all about capturing the bridge , right ? Every scenario revolves around taking it intact . If we destroy it ... Game over . Or we get digitized because we 're trapped inside the sim when it crashes . [ DEXTER WHIMPERS ] They got sentries patrolling the shore plus a couple of snipers back in the trees . - What about the river approach ? - No . Machine-gun nests here and here . Then we 're gonna have to go across the bridge deck and place our charges there . What 's that ? Six sticks of C2 . It 's your bomb . - It 's the best I could do . - What , are we back in the Dark Ages ? - It 's never gonna work . - Sure it will . Hundred feet of fuse wire ought to buy us eight , nine minutes . - I 'll light it once you 're off the bridge . - You 're coming . - Someone needs to keep watch . - Right . Like you did at al-Talil . - I told you , you got the wrong guy . - The fewer men on the bridge the better . - How many guards to deal with ? - One of ours , two of theirs . - We gotta get past one of our guys . SOMMERS : Won 't be a problem . - He 's gonna have to take a leak at 0400 . - How do you know ? How do I know the kid behind me just fell asleep ? Stay with him . Hey , that battle review at OCS how 'd you do ? C minus . PINOCCHIO : What 's he doing out here ? What are you doing ? He 's just a kid . Don 't be stupid . You heard what Sommer said about this place . You can 't change anything . - I don 't believe that . - Hobbes ! GERMAN SOLDIER : Halt ! [ SPEAKING IN GERMAN ] No ! Dexter ! Sommer ! Sommer ! Stay down . - Where the hell were you ? - I had to pull back . I didn 't wanna jeopardize your position . They got him . They got Hobbes . That means we gotta blow the bridge now . You don 't understand . He was captured , alive . Look , I 'm sorry about your friend , but they 're gonna make him talk and they 'll kill him . There ain 't nothing we can do . - This might be our only chance . - So it 's all about saving your own ass ? Yes , that 's exactly what it 's about , fulfilling my mission and going home . What about those men , my men , that you left behind ? - They didn 't get to go home . - Their number was up . - Just like your friend Hobbes . - We are not leaving him behind , got it ? - We 're getting him out . - Uh-uh . There 's no " we " here . I ain 't dying for your friend . You wanna play Rambo that 's your business . I am blowing this bridge . Hey , not without this , you 're not . You ever point a gun at me again , you better use it . [ SPEAKING IN GERMAN ] [ DOOR OPENS ] Kaugumy ? IN ENGLISH : It 's sugar free . What ? That 's the problem with the damn 1940s , too much sugar . Everyone here eats red meat seven days a week . Everyone smokes . You 're Wolff ? - Who sent you ? HOBBES : No one . We were looking for your shelter outside Levittown . We found your dog tags there . You 're not working for Santiago ? No . We wanted you to help us kill him . Kill Santiago ? You really think that you and I could do that ? - One man against his army ? - You nearly did . That was a long time ago . - Why don 't you come back with us . - Back ? Back to what ? The world out there , Santiago 's world ? No , thank you . I 'll take my chances in here . You know , you ought to come over to this side , like I did . Food 's a lot better . You speak any German ? Too bad . We 're getting out . - We 're gonna blow the bridge . - You don 't wanna do that . HOBBES : Why not ? The jump portal . I 'm sorry . I can 't help you . - It 's on the bridge , isn 't it ? - There 's nothing more I can do . [ DOOR CLOSES ] How the hell did you get here ? A glitch . Terrific . Now you tell me . Hey , where you going ? Hey ! [ MAN YELLS ] [ SPEAKS IN GERMAN ] - Miss me ? - What are you doing here ? I had a sudden craving for schnitzel . - Come on , let 's get out of here . - Wait . Something we gotta do first . [ GUN COCKS ] - Not one word . - Let 's take a walk . - Hey , what 's he doing here ? - He knows a shortcut . [ GERMAN SOLDIERS YELLING ] - We can 't blow the bridge . - Why the hell not ? The jump port 's on it . - What if it is ? - Then we can get out . And then what ? Run from Santiago for the rest of our lives ? - Lf we don 't fight , he wins . - He 's already won . If you really believe that , he has . Come on . Fuse wire ! What has he done ? What have you done ? ! I had to do it . They would have found the bomb . - You son of a bitch . - I didn 't think you were coming back . Besides , it 'll all be over soon . - We gotta pull that fuse wire . - You 'll never make it in the day . - A sniper will take you . - I ask you to talk ? - He 's right . - We 've got no choice . Then you 'll be killed . Unless somebody volunteers to take out those snipers . PINOCCHIO : What are you doing ? - Going for the fuse wire . You , with the C minus ? - Hey ! - See you on the other side . Pinocchio ! [ GUNS SHOOTING ] [ MEN YELLING ] HOBBES : Pinocchio ? I know where it is . The jump port . - We 're getting out . - I can 't make it . I 'm not leaving you . Go . Go ! Now ! Wait ! Wait ! [ DEXTER WHIMPERS AND BARKS ] [ CAR ENGINE STARTS ] HOBBES : What is it that determines the course of our lives ? A twist of fate ? The road not taken ? Or is it a man ' s actions that decide his path ? Are we held accountable for the choices we make ? Even here , in this world ? I 'm out . I 'm out . I 'm out ! I 'm free ! HOBBES : In the end , Sophie , I believe it comes to this : A man can be guided by his humanity or by something else . BO Y : I made this . Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

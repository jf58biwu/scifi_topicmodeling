 Last time on Star Trek : Voyager ... Stay the course ! They 're breaking through . We 'll be dead if we don 't get the shields back up . Arm yourselves ! Who attacked you ? We don 't know . We can 't communicate with them . They 've been attacking us for weeks . Your crew has been running criminal experiments here . I know . I designed them . You ? That 's a violation of your programming . They deleted my ethical subroutines . It 's easy to cling to principles when you 're standing on a vessel with its bulkheads intact , manned by a crew that 's not starving . It 's never easy , but , if we turn our backs on our principles , we stop being human . I 'm putting an end to your experiments , and you are hereby relieved of your command . I rerouted transporter control to a panel in the next junction . We can ... Bridge , they 've got the field generator . What do you mean , they 've got it ? I don 't know how , but they beamed it off of Voyager . We 're going home . We can 't let Voyager stop us now , not when we 're this close . Shields are down . Arm yourselves . Get us out of here . And now the conclusion . Fissures are opening , all decks ! Captain ! Give me tactical control ! Good guess . I used a deflector pulse to reinforce the shields . It won 't hold for long . Bridge to Sick Bay . We have a medical emergency . Doctor , respond . Ensign . Casualty reports are coming in . Two dead , 13 wounded . We took heavy damage to the engines . The Equinox ? They 've gone to warp . Any sign of nucleogenic particles ? No . Then they haven 't engaged their enhanced warp drive yet . Keep looking for ... Report . The shield grid is back in place . The aliens are staying clear . Are sensors picking up Voyager ? It looks like they 're under attack . Maintain course . Captain , I found the Doctor 's mobile emitter on Deck 9 . You might want to take it to Sick Bay . Any sign of the Doc ? I 've got him right here . Please state the nature of the ... Don 't bother . You should start with Chakotay . I 've got him stabilized , but he 's got internal injuries . We found your emitter on Deck 9 . I was taken hostage by the Equinox crew . I deactivated myself to escape . Did you stop them ? No . I 'd ask for a status report , but I 'm not sure I 'd want to hear it . Harry 's analyzing the sound we 've been hearing . He thinks it 's some form of communication . Well , I once figured out how to speak with a Terrelian Seapod . This couldn 't be that much harder . Once I get out of Sick Bay , I 'll lend him a hand . We should all be focusing our efforts on finding the Equinox . First things first- - we 've got to stop these attacks . Our enemies aren 't the aliens . They 're the humans aboard the Equinox . It 's crucial that you don 't ... Who is it ? It 's Max . I 've brought you a visitor . Hold on . Come in . I 'm glad you 're okay . I 've been using this synaptic stimulator . I was just taking a stroll along the Tenkaran Coast . You 're welcome to try it . State your intentions . You know , once we get our enhanced warp drive back on line , we 'll be on our way home . But it 'll still take months to get there . You can spend that time in the brig , or ... you can become part of this crew . I 'd prefer the latter . I 'd prefer the brig . You know , Janeway 's not the only captain who can help you explore your humanity . You would be an inferior role model . Janeway clung to her morality at the expense of her crew . Maybe you should learn from that mistake . Her only mistake was trusting you . Take care of her wound . First-degree phaser burns , minor lacerations . Looks like we 'll have to amputate . That was a joke . You 're supposed to smile and make a witty retort . I 'm familiar with human banter . Yours is crude and predictable . You know , Seven- - can I call you Seven ? We don 't have many luxuries around here . All we 've got is each other . You might try letting your shields down , or else it 's going to be a lonely trip . I 'll be damned . Looks like our Doctor left us a replacement . Seven ... ? We are captives . I was attacked by their EMH . Looks like he downloaded you into our database . Good . You can treat your friend . Priming the injectors . Marla to Bridge . Go ahead . We 're ready . Acknowledged . Infuse the enhanced warp drive with 20 isograms of the compound . Aye , sir . Warp drive ready . Engage . What happened ? Power relays are off-line . They 've been encoded . Give us the codes . No . If she won 't give us the codes , maybe we could extract them ourselves . Seven 's cranial infrastructure is highly complex . You 'll need months just to figure out what she had for breakfast . That 's why you 're gonna help us . I refuse . Do it or I 'll erase your program . Be my guest . Doctor . Don 't worry . They need me . They 'd be cutting off their holographic nose to spite their face . Now , I suggest you ... All right , Doctor . Now , get to work . You know what we 're looking for . Very well . She 'll try to resist . I 'll have to restrain her . Doctor . I deleted his ethical subroutines . He 'll be a little more cooperative now . You keep me posted . Aye , Captain . This way , please . It 's not exactly Shakespeare , but it gets the point across . A small olive branch is still an olive branch . Run this through your translation matrix . Set your weapons down . Commander ? Somebody 's got to start trusting somebody around here . Belay that order . I appreciate your optimism , but , in this case , weapons . Ready to transmit . Drop shields , Bridge only . Go ahead , Harry . Raise shields . If they understood our message , they haven 't responded . There 's your response . Activate another deflector pulse . Shields are holding at 62 percent . That should buy us another few minutes of peace and quiet . I suggest we make the most of it . Focus your efforts on repairing the warp drive . We 've got to find the Equinox . If it 's all the same to you , I 'd like to take another stab at the message . If we can reroute ... They 're not listening , Chakotay . We should be tracking Ransom , not tinkering with adverbs . Want your First Officer 's advice ? Allow me . Our deflector 's losing power and when it fails , we 'll be defenseless . It 's Voyager we should be worrying about , not the Equinox . You 'd make a great First Officer . It 's advice worth taking . Maybe so , but we have a crew member trapped on that ship . is this really about Seven , or is it about Ransom ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 've been known to hold a grudge . This man betrayed Starfleet , he broke the Prime Directive dishonored everything you believe in , and threw Voyager to the wolves . Borg , Hirogen , Malon- - we 've run into our share of bad guys . Ransom 's no different . Yes , he is . You said it yourself . He 's human . I don 't blame you for being angry , but you can 't compromise the safety of this ship to satisfy some personal vendetta . I appreciate your candor . Now let me be just as blunt . You 're right , I am angry . I 'm damned angry . He 's a Starfleet Captain and he 's decided to abandon everything this uniform stands for . He 's out there right now torturing and murdering innocent life-forms just to get home a little quicker . I 'm not going to stand for it . I 'm going to hunt him down no matter how long it takes , no matter what the cost . If you want to call that a vendetta , go right ahead . Why did you bring us here ? This planet has a parthogenic atmosphere . It 'll keep us from being detected while we make repairs . We also found a few deuterium deposits . Take an away team , Noah , and see if you can localize the ore . You won 't be protected from the aliens . Arm yourselves with phasers . At the first sign of trouble , we 'll beam you back . Aye , sir . The ocular node 's connected to the sensory node The sensory node 's connected to the cortical node The cortical node 's connected to the reticular node ... Oh , now , don 't look so gloomy . There 's a silver lining to all this . Just think- - we 're finally going to see Earth . You are obviously delusional . Allow me to repair your program . Now , why would I want you to do that ? You of all people should understand . Being unfettered by ethical subroutines has made me far more efficient . Status ? I 'm going to extract her cortical array . It contains an index of her memory engrams . But once I 've removed it , her higher brain functions , language , cognitive skills will be severely damaged . Tell me the codes . No . Janeway was right about one thing- - you are unique . Now , it would be a shame to lose you . Your compassion is irrelevant . You think this is easy for me ? The sight of you on that table ... But you 're leaving me no choice . " No choice . " You say that frequently . You destroy life-forms to attain your goals , then claim that they left you no choice . Does that logic comfort you ? The codes . You 'll have to destroy me to obtain them . The reticular node 's connected to the occipital node ... Captain 's Log , supplemental . Our warp drive 's back on line , but repeated sensor sweeps have failed to locate the Equinox . Come in . You wanted to see me ? It 's not like you to submit recommendations in writing . The last time we spoke , you weren 't exactly receptive . I 'm afraid I 'm not going to be very receptive this time either . It 's an interesting idea , but the Ankari are 50 light-years in the wrong direction . I understand that , but they 're the ones who introduced Ransom to these life-forms . It stands to reason they might be able to communicate with them- - tell them to call off their attacks . Our first priority is to find Ransom . Still no sign of nucleogenic particles ? Not yet . Then he couldn 't have gotten far . Without his enhanced drive , his ship 's only capable of warp 6 . I 've been studying his service record . He 's had his share of run-ins with hostile aliens . It seems that when he 's being pursued , he tends to hide . At Epsilon iv he ran into a Klingon bird-of-prey . Played a game of cat and mouse for three days in a nebula before the Klingons finally gave up . Two years later , he eluded a Romulan warbird by taking his vessel into the atmosphere of a gas giant . Go to Astrometrics . Start looking for the kind of place you would hide if your ship was damaged . Yes , ma 'am . How was the beach ? Do these programs have people in them ? No , just landscapes . Why ? Forget it . I 'm reading a vein of ore . Azimuth 1 17 ... 30 meters . It could run pretty deep . We might need to use phasers to excavate it . It 's funny , this reminds me of McKinley Park . I used to take my sister there when we were kids . This place looks just like it . As I recall , there was a family of ground squirrels who lived right over there . And there was a patch of poison ivy next to it . When I was 10 , I walked right through it and I swelled up like a Regellian blood worm . When I get back to Earth , the first thing I 'm going to do is ... Four to beam up . We 're receiving a subspace transmission . From who ? I can 't tell . I don 't see a ship out there . Open a channel . Doctor to Equinox . Respond . We can hear you . Voyager 's found you . They 've entered orbit . They polarized their hull to mask their approach . I believe they 've already planned an ambush on the away team . Janeway 's been tracking the Equinox ... Get him back . I can 't . Ransom to away team . Noah , prepare to beam back to the ship . They 're not down there . All hands to battle stations . 30,000 kilometers and closing . Target their power core . Direct hit . Minor damage . Return fire . Bridge to Torres . Status ? I can 't locate their shield grid generator . Can you divert more power to sensors ? Stand by . They 've damaged our deflector , Captain . If it goes off-line , we 'll be vulnerable to the alien attacks . Noted . Target his weapons array . We lost our phaser banks . Torpedoes full spread . It 's B 'Elanna . She 's trying to bypass our security protocols . Stop her . Computer , open a com-link to the Equinox . Workstation 33-Beta . Max , listen to me . Back for round two , BLT ? This isn 't one of our games . People are dying over here . I wish you didn 't have to be one of them . Max , please ... Shields are weakening . We 've almost got him . Keep targeting their weapons array . One more torpedo ought to do it . Captain ... Fire . Weapons are down ! Janeway to Ransom . Surrender your vessel . We still have thrusters , don 't we ? Aye , sir . Lay in a course through the planet 's atmosphere- - 60-degree vector . What the hell is he doing ? Follow him . We 're crossing the upper thermosphere . Phasers . Shields are weakening- - 31 percent ... 29 ... inertial dampers are off-line . Captain , if we lose our shields , we 'll be attacked by the aliens . Captain ! Break off pursuit ! They 're retreating . Take us up ! They took heavy damage- - shields , propulsion . Get us out of here . They 've gone to warp . Match their course and speed . We can 't , not until we restore primary systems . Time ? We 'll need a few hours . At least we didn 't come away empty-handed . I want Ransom 's tactical status . I want it now , Mr. Lessing . Or what ? You 'll hit me ? No , Crewman . I 'll drop the shields around this room , and let your little friends come pay you a visit . That would be murder . You could also call it " poetic justice . " I suppose the plan is that you 're going to come to my rescue now , right ? There 's no plan as far as I know . The Captain 's on her own . Ransom 's status , now . No way in hell . We all make our own hell , Mr. Lessing . I hope you enjoy yours . The com is active . We 'll be outside if you have a change of heart . What are you doing ? Weren 't you listening ? Don 't do this . He 'll break . Bridge to the Captain . We 've lost shields in Section 29-Alpha . I know . Stand by . He 's a loyal officer . He 's not going to betray his Captain . Put up the shields . He 'll break . Captain ! As you were . Level nine authorization required . Damn it , Kathryn ! You 're panicking . He 's going to talk . Captain , a fissure is opening in that section . Understood . Okay , you 've demonstrated your loyalty to your Captain . Fine . Now let 's talk about the Ankari . If there 's an Ankari vessel less than two light-years from here , why haven 't we detected it ? Apparently , they use a unique form of propulsion , which makes them hard to find . You think they 'll be willing to help us ? It 's worth a try . Mr. Lessing has agreed to show you how to adjust the sensors . Once you find the Ankari ship , - set a course . - Aye , sir . Did our prisoner disclose any other information ? I 'm afraid not . The rest of you continue with the repairs . Dismissed . Commander . All right . We 're going to try it your way . But I want to make one thing clear . Our first priority is to get Ransom . If there 's one thing you 've made clear , it 's that . We 've had our disagreements , Chakotay , but you 've never openly opposed me . You almost killed that man today . It was a calculated risk and I took it . It was a bad call . I 'll note your objection in my log . I don 't give a damn about your log . This isn 't about rules and regulations . It 's about right and wrong . And I 'm warning you- - l won 't let you cross that line again . Well then you leave me no choice . You are hereby relieved of duty until further notice . What 's happened to you , Kathryn ? I was about to ask you the same question . They are not responding . Tractor beam . Captain , the Ankari ship has done nothing to ... Just do it . We 're being hailed . On screen . Starfleet . Yes . Leave us alone . There 's nothing of value on our ship . We need your guidance . Your spirits of good fortune are attacking us . Of course they are . You 've been killing them ! We are not the ones responsible . Equinox . That 's right . Can you communicate with the aliens ? Release my ship . I can 't do that . Not until you agree to talk to them . I will summon them , but you must talk to them . You must convince them . They say they want the humans to die . A difficult place to start a negotiation . Will they understand me ? Yes . We didn 't do this to you . We 're trying to stop the humans who did . They don 't believe you would harm your own kind . We have rules for behavior . The Equinox has broken those rules by killing your species . It 's our duty to stop them . Give us the Equinox . Give us the Equinox . They insist on destroying the ones who were responsible . We will punish them according to our own rules . They will be imprisoned . They will lose their freedom . All right . If you stop your attacks , I 'll deliver the Equinox to you . Captain ... I know what I 'm doing , Tuvok . These beings would destroy Captain Ransom and his crew . What 's their answer ? Your behavior is irrational . We could find another solution . I 've already confined my First Officer to quarters . Would you like to join him ? Well ? They agree . We 're going to need more fuel . We 've only got enough left to jump another 500 light-years . " Fuel " ? is that the euphemism we 're using now ? You mean we need to kill more life-forms . Several more . Oh , my darling , oh , my darling Oh , my darling ... Clementine ... How much longer ? Another hour . Maybe less . You are lost and gone forever ... Dreadful sorry , Clementine ... What are you doing ? Her auditory processor . We used to practice duets together . In fact , I taught her this old chestnut . Light she was And like a fairy ... And her shoes were number nine ... Herring boxes without topses ... Sandals were for Clementine ... Drove she ducklings to the water ... Enough . Why the long face , Captain ? You 're about to get your crew home . She tried to stand in your way . You had no choice . No choice . Thank you , Doctor . When this is all over , perhaps you 'll allow me to teach you my repertoire . I 'm going to need a new partner . Hmm . Drove she ducklings to the water ... You . What are you doing here ? Hiding . Like you . I 'm not hiding . It 's beautiful . I can see why this brings you comfort . I don 't know what you 're talking about . But it isn 't real . You 're not real . Now leave me alone . It 's not too late to stop . I don 't have a choice . Find another way . There is no other way . Stop trying to hide . I told you ! I 'm not hiding ! Now get away from me ! End this . No ! Bridge to Ransom . Go ahead . Janeway 's found us . On my way . Distance ? 50,000 kilometers , closing fast . Maintain course . Voyager 's approaching at high warp . There 's a class-2 nebula less than a light-year from here . Janeway 's sensors won 't be able to track us once we 're inside . I think that we should pursue this ... No . Open a channel . Change of tactics ? You might say that . It 's time we found another way home . Another way ? We 're going to cooperate with Janeway , Max , if she 's willing . Rudy , with all due respect , have you lost your mind ? Just the opposite . They 're within range . They 're charging weapons . - Hail them . - Belay that order . Raise shields . You 're relieved of duty , Commander . I 'm taking command . Anyone who isn 't with me , speak up now . Take him to the brig . I 'm sorry . What 's the status of our weapons ? Full complement of torpedoes . Minimal phasers . Open a secure channel to their Sick Bay . Stand by weapons . Aye , sir . I 'm here . We going to need your help , Doctor . See if you can find Voyager 's current shield frequency . Acknowledged . I 'll need a few minutes . They are firing torpedoes . Direct hit to our port shields . They 're holding . Return the favor . This isn 't the brig . I know . I 'm with you , sir . Let 's find a way to end this . We 'll need to access transporter control . We 've damaged their port nacelle . They 're venting plasma . They 're dropping out of warp . Stay with them . Doctor to Equinox . I 've got their shield frequency . I 'm transmitting it to you now . They 'll try to remodulate . Keep monitoring . Aye , sir . They 've slowed to one-quarter impulse . Prepare a tractor beam . They 're launching another torpedo . Full power to the forward shields . Hull breach on Deck 4 ! How 'd they get through our shields ? Hard about . Get us out of range . Remodulate the shields . They 're retreating . Pursuit course . Maintain fire . They took out the weapons array ! Tuvok ? I 've been rotating the shield frequency every ten seconds . We 've lost impulse engines . We 're being hailed . It 's Ransom . Put him through . Captain , I 'm prepared to surrender the Equinox , but I 'm no longer in command . Max decided to stage a little mutiny , but I think I can stop him . I 've isolated transporter control . I can beam all of us to Voyager . You might want to have some guards standing by . Not everyone here is going to be happy to see you . Proceed . Ma 'am ? He 's still a Starfleet Captain . He may have forgotten that for a while , but I believe him . Someone 's trying to beam us off . Force fields ! They 're deflecting our targeting scanners . Then beam the others to Voyager , yourself included . I 'll take care of Max . Aye , sir . Computer , give me access to the shield grid . Well ... I see you 've made yourself at home . What are you doing here ? Taking back my Sick Bay . Stop where you are . I 've planted photonic charges throughout these holo-projectors . With one command sequence , I can blow out your entire ... Computer , delete the Equinox EMH . The Doctor 's not transmitting anymore . Burke to Doctor . Report . I 'm afraid your physician 's no longer on call . Max , this is the Captain . I 've dropped the shield grid everywhere except the Bridge and my current location . The vital systems are exposed . I suggest you beam to Voyager while you still can . The core is overloading . We 've got to get out of here . Where ? Voyager 's brig ? It 's better than being vaporized . We still have a working shuttle . The Shuttle Bay 's two decks down ! Sir , the aliens ! We 'll make it . This way . There 's only one life sign left . It 's Ransom . Captain . Things didn 't work out exactly as I planned , but you 've got everyone worth getting . We 're beaming you out of there . This ship is about to explode . I 've got to put some distance between us . I 've accessed helm control . You can set auto-navigation and then transport to Voyager . There 's no time ! You 've got a fine crew , Captain . Promise me you 'll get ' em home . I promise . Captain 's Log , supplemental . With the Equinox destroyed , the aliens have withdrawn to their realm . I 've reinstated Chakotay , and we 've set a course for home . Good as new . I 'd like you to regenerate for the next few hours . It 'll help stabilize your cortical array . Understood . Regarding the ... unpleasantness aboard the Equinox , I hope you don 't think less of me . Your program was altered . It 's quite disconcerting to know that all someone has to do is flick a switch to turn me into Mr. Hyde . Perhaps you should enhance your program with security protocols . It will prevent such tampering in the future . Good thinking . When I 'm done regenerating , I will assist you . Thanks . You were off-key . I beg your pardon ? " My Darling Clementine , " third verse , second measure . That 's impossible . Your vocal modulations deviated by 0.30 deci-hertz . I can assist you with that as well . Really ? Holodeck 2 , tomorrow , 1600 hours . Just you , me ... and a tuning fork . I look forward to it . The last time we welcomed you aboard , you took advantage of our trust . You betrayed this crew . I won 't make that mistake again . Noah Lessing , Marla Gilmore , James Morrow , Brian Sofin , Angelo Tassoni , you are hereby stripped of rank . You 'll be expected to serve as crewmen on this vessel . Your privileges will be limited , and you 'll serve under close supervision for as long as I deem fit . This time , you 'll have to earn our trust . Dismissed . Repairs ? Coming along . How 's the crew ? A lot of frayed nerves . Neelix is organizing a potluck ... to help boost morale . Will I see you there ? I 'm replicating the salad . I 'll bring the croutons . Chakotay ... you know ... you may have had good reason to stage a little mutiny of your own . The thought had occurred to me , but that would have been crossing the line . Will you look at that . All these years , all these battles . This thing 's never fallen down before . Let 's put it back up where it belongs .

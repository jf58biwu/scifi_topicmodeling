 I want a list of people who were on that bus with Jarod . The bus company says they can 't disclose passenger identification . The bus company says . [ Chuckles ] - [ Doorbell Rings ] - You are truly pitiful . Well , yeah , they have certain privacy regulations . There 's a certain protocol that we have to follow . - Daddy . - Daddy ? - Well , are you gonna invite me in ? - [ Broots ] Hello ? - Of course . - Hello ? Miss Parker ? [ Beeps ] - Come in . - Hmm . I like what you 've done with the place . Your mother 'd love it . [ Chuckles ] Oh , now that is special . - Is that new ? - It was a gift ... when I graduated college , from you . You remembered . Hmm . Why , you were 10 years old . You 'd just come home from your first piano recital . What was the name of that piece you played ? " FÃ¼r Elise . " Bach 's " Minuet in G. " - Daddy , what are you - - Oh , she was so beautiful , like you . I wish people would remember your mother the way she really was . - They always taint her memory with lies . - Lies ? Yeah , the kind Jarod perpetuates about her - about me . The truth about Mom is in my heart . Nothing can change that . Daddy ... why are you here ? Oh , bad dream - I was awake all night . I just , uh , want to make sure you 're all right . Bach 's " Minuet in G " - I would love to hear you play that again . [ Door Opens , Closes ] - [ Sydney ] You sure it was her father ? - [ Broots ] Yeah . Strange that Mr. Parker would go back to that house ... after all these years - typically unpredictable . - [ Miss Parker ] Working hard , I see . - Miss Parker . Oh ! This came for you . I hear your father came to visit . Would you like to talk about it ? - Does it look like I want to talk about it ? - Mm-mmm . " Dover Town Bank ' " ? Jarod . A letter from your mother ? [ Thinking ] " March 20 , 1970 . " I 'm counting the days until our trip to Europe . " How excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world . " For now , though , my friend and I must amend ... " some of the ugliness that exists around us . " But I promise , you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14 . All my love , Mom . ' " [ Gasps ] " April 14 ' " - the day after Mom died . [ Gasps ] [ Sydney ] Miss Parker ? - [ Woman ] Next in line , please . - [ Man ] It 's over there - that table there . [ Phones Ringing ] [ Woman # 2 ] The loan desk is over there , sir . Oh , hello . Don 't put all your eggs in one basket . Harold Rosen . Can I interest you in one of our Easter annuities or I.R.A. accounts ? Back off , Bugs . Excuse me . I 'm expecting a package - a letter or something left for me . - The name is Parker . - Dad ? Mom sent me here to get the child support . She said not to leave until you pay . One of the tellers can assist you . [ Phones Ringing ] [ Chattering ] Easter annuity ? Guess not . Ma 'am , I have customers ahead of you . If you 'll please wait in line - Patience has never been one of your virtues , has it , Miss Parker ? You 've got quite a set showing up here . Well , even you wouldn 't pull a gun in a bank . Where did you find that letter ? In the last place you 'd expect . Would you ... care to read more ? You son of a bitch . You could 've just sent these . Why drag me down here ? So you wouldn 't miss ... him . Good morning , Mr. Fenigor . Mr. Fenigor , I 've got to getJarod and Timmy out ofhere tonight . Fenigor ? The man who helped my mother rescue the children at the Centre ? The man who helped your mother try to save me . He 's a regular . Comes here every Friday morning . Has been doing it for years . [ Miss Parker Thinking ] " My friend and I must amend ... some of the ugliness that exists around us . " - He may know who killed my mother . - Who my parents are - the secrets to both our pasts . [ Gunshots ] [ People Screaming ] Everybody sit tight . ! This is a robbery . ! Move down ! Let 's go ! - Move down . ! - You move , you die . Are we clear ? [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . Move down . ! Move down . ! Let 's go . ! Shut up . ! I find one exploding dye pack , somebody 's not going home for lunch . You got that ? - What the hell are you doing ? - Ending this thing . By getting everybody killed ? The sooner they get their money and leave , the sooner we get answers from Fenigor . [ Man # 1 ] Listen to me , people . Nobody speaks , nobody moves , nobody gets hurt . - Come on . Come on ! - [ Man # 2 ] Shut up . ! [ Man # 1 ] Everybody keep their hands where I can see them . - [ Ringing ] - Dad , don 't ! Alarm ! [ Ringing Continues ] " Frank K. Isaac , Assistant Manager . " - [ People Whimpering ] - I have a family . I 'll bet you do . - [ Trigger Clicks ] - Put the gun down and turn around . I can 't allow you to walk out ofhere . We got ourselves a problem then , don 't we ? - Clave - - Shut up . Now , l-I 'm gonna count to three . You 're gonna lay that piece down onto the floor . One ... two - [ Breathes Heavily ] [ Woman Screams ] Get back . Now ! [ Woman Whimpering ] What the hell are you looking at ? Check the front door . Get down . Now ! - [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] - You got something to say , sister ? - Nothing you want to hear . - Keep it that way . [ Sirens Continue ] All right , everybody up . Move over here . Come on . - It 's not too late to stop this . - Tell him that . Now shut up and move . [ Man On Speaker ] This is Lieutenant Row . I want SWATsnipers deployed ... to all buildings across the street and surrounding the bank . [ Man On Radio ] Roger that . Sniper teams deployed and in position in three minutes . Okay , give me an open line into the bank . Get those people back . Let 's go . Move it . ! Come on . Everyone in . Everybody down behind the manager 's desk . Now ! Move ! - Get down . ! - [ People Murmuring ] If you move , you 're dead . We want your valuables - watches , rings , wallets . Whatever you got , give it up . And your wallet . In the sack . - [ Clave ] Hurry up . ! - That means you too , lady . Come on . - [ Jarod ] Looks like he 's just seen a ghost . - He has ... and I intend to rattle some bones as soon as I can get to him . How is it that this guy was still alive and I didn 't know about it ? Well , I guess that Daddy keeps some secrets from you . Did he tell you about those letters ? I 'm sure he didn 't know about them . Well , that would be a stretch , considering that I stole them from his strongbox . I 'm afraid I woke him up . - When ? - Last night . - Why are you here ? - Oh , bad dream - I was awake all night . You 'd think a man with as much to lose as your father ... - would have a better home security system . - You 're lying . Ask him about that little gift I left for him . [ Raines ] Are you sure it was Jarod ? Took some of Catherine 's things and some of mine and he left this behind . Jarod is rubbing our noses in it . [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Whose phone is that ? [ Broots ] Hello . Hello ? - Hello ? Miss Parker ? - [ Man Whispering ] What 's going on ? - Hello ? - Give it . Miss Parker ? Miss Parker ? [ Beeps ] It 's Broots . It 's Broots . Can you hear me ? Hello ? Hello ? [ Man # 2 ] Watches and wallets - Come on everybody . Give it up . - Put it in the bag . - [ Clicks ] Jude ! You weren 't gonna shoot my little brother , were you , lady ? - I 'll leave the executions to you . - [ Clicks ] Throw something over him . Out of sight , out of mind , huh ? Hey ! Leave her alone . All right . All right . Get up . - What ? - Get up ! - What are you doin ; Clavell ? - Gettin ' us out of here . Come on . Come on . ! Two armed robbers have entered the Dover Town Bank . We do know gunshots have been fired and hostages have been taken . [ Sighs ] Huh . Well , she never hung up her phone ... so I was able to triangulate the signal . Called the Dover police , and they told me about the robbery . Then I called Mr. Parker 's office , but , uh , nobody 's gotten back to me . We need to go to Dover . [ Gasps ] Without a directive from upstairs ? - Sydney , forget it . - Miss Parker is not just a colleague , Broots . - She 's a friend . - [ Reporter ] Just a minute . A situation is developing . One of the robbery suspects is emerging from the bank with a hostage at gunpoint . Sydney , is that who I think it is ? I want a helicopter to the airport , and I want a plane waiting ' on the runway . Oh , boy . You got one hour to set it up , or people start to die . - [ Raines ] Where is this ? - Dover . - Dover Town Bank ? - Round up your group . [ Thinking ] " April 13 , 2 : 00 a.m. We failed to rescue Timmy . " - No ! - " Raines had already destroyed that sweet little boy . ' " Raines , what are you gonna do with Timmy now ? There is no Timmy anymore . " They 'll call him Angelo now . We 're planning to rescueJarod tonight . " Then tomorrow , you and I will be on our way to a better place . All my love , Mom . " - Going somewhere ? - Apparently not . There 's no smoking here . Call a cop . I need the key to the outer vault door . - Dad , give it to him . - Dad ? This your daughter , Frank ? You stay away from her . Okay , Dad . She sure is a peach though . Your mother should be shot for sending you here . If you cared about me , she wouldn 't have asked me to do this . That 's what she said , I don 't care about you ? She 's telling you lies . Lies - the kind Jarod perpetuates about her-about me . Parents lying to their children - Now , where have I heard that one before ? My father had his reasons for keeping those letters from me . Like he had his reasons for saying that your mother 's death was a ... suicide ? But if you really believe that , why are you so hell-bent ... on finding out what Mr. Fenigor has to say ? [ Door Opens , Closes ] Combo to the vault cage . Only the senior manager has it . He 's not in today . - How you doin ' , sweetie ? - [ Gasps ] Why don 't you pick on somebody your own size ? Why don 't I put a bullet through your brain ? I can open the vault . [ People Murmuring ] [ Clave ] What are you , some kind ofhandyman ? Just versatile . You know , there 's another way out of here - one with less bloodshed , specifically yours . What are you talkin ' about ? There 's a vent that leads down to a main sewer line . It leads right out of here . - And how do you know that ? - I studied the blueprints before I came in here . You 're not the only one who 's on the run . So you 're a handyman and a fugitive architect . You are versatile . - [ Clicks ] - Now open it . That 's very good . Let 's go . [ Door Opens ] [ Door Opens ] Tell the cops to bring us something to eat . I 'm starving . You 're always starving ' . Get in there . Give me a bag . Come on . ! Keep an eye out . [ Door Closes ] Mr. Fenigor , my name is Jarod . Do you remember me ? Should I ? I was one of the children that you and Catherine Parker tried to rescue from the Centre . You tried to help me once . Please ... help me now . - l-I don 't know what you 're talking about . - You are the only person ... who can help me find out who my parents are . Look , you are being held against your will . You feel trapped and terrified . I live my entire life that way . Please ... help me . You and her together ? It 's complicated . You don 't know what you 're asking of me . I am asking you to honor Catherine Parker 's memory . Please tell me who my parents are . Help me find out who I am . [ Crying ] I can 't . - Please . - I can 't . - I 'm sorry . I just can 't . - Mr. Fenigor ! No ! [ Woman Screams ] - No . ! - Hey . ! - I have to help him . - I didn 't shoot him so he could be helped . - Clave - - Not now , Jude . Hey , hey , hey ! It is one thing to defend yourself against an armed guard . It 's another thing to shoot an innocent man in the back . If this man dies , so do you , in the electric chair . - [ Man ] Is he alive ? - [ Harold ] I don 't know . - [ Groaning ] - [ Gasps ] The bullet punctured his lung . He 's drawing in air from the exit wound . I need hand towels , and I need some soap . In the bathroom . [ Gasping ] Details at this time are sketchy . However , another shot was just heard from inside the bank . I 'm going to make my way to the SWAT commander now for confirmation . Don 't you die on me . I need a plastic bag , and I need some tape . [ Harold ] I 've got a bag . I have to seal the wound , or he won 't be able to breathe . Cut off strips about this long . Apply constant pressure to the wound like this . - I have to get him to a hospital . - Nobody goes anywhere . Maybe we should do it . It 's just one guy . Nobody goes anywhere ! Find me something to elevate his legs . He 's diaphoretic . His pulse is thready , and he 's bleeding internally . I can stabilize him for a while , but he needs to get into surgery . - What the hell am I doing here ? - How does it feel to be the prey instead of the predator ? You wouldn 't be the prey if you 'd get back to the Centre where you belong . - Oh , nice ! - Fitting . You are so willing to ruin my life . Is your father 's validation that important to you ? I 'm standing here with Kristi Isaac , whose daughter Kaley is a hostage inside the bank . - Kristi ? - Please don 't hurt my daughter . She 's all I have . [ Kaley ] Mom ? Kaley - Kaley , I love you . Frank , please take care ofher . [ Gasping , Grunting ] It 's difficult for little girls to figure out their fathers , isn 't it ? - Your point ? - You give your loyalties to a man who fills your head with lies - lies about those letters , lies about Fenigor . I suppose my loyalty should go to you . What would you do if Fenigor confessed ... - that your father killed your mother ? - He didn 't ! He loved her . You are so sure of that , aren 't you , Miss Parker ? [ Reporter ] It appears that the police seem to be mobilizing ... for a possible assault on the bank . Everybody into the vault ! Let 's go ! How 's he doing ? - He 's stable ... for now . - How well do you know him ? Comes in every Friday to pull cash out of his trust account . Does he ever come in to make deposits ? His account is funded by an outside source - some company from Blue Cove . So the Centre is paying Fenigor to keep quiet . [ Exhales ] The question is , who ? And quiet about what ? [ Sydney ] Over here , Broots . - [ Helicopter Hovering In Distance ] - [ Man , Indistinct ] - Anything ? - No . Uh , police , locals - no one I recognize . Maybe we 're the only ones who know thatJarod is here . [ Exhales ] Think again . It 's Gar and another of Raines 's guys . [ Sydney ] They 're not the only ones . There 's Sam . [ Broots ] This place is crawling with Sweepers . We need to figure out what Raines is up to . I 'll follow Sam . You follow the others . Wait , wait , wait , wait ! Sydney ! Oh , God , what am I doing here ? I must be out of my mind . - [ Harold ] What are they doing ? - [ Jarod ] Working on escape plan B. [ Thinking ] " April 13 , 7 : 00 a.m. " I have a bad feeling about the people surrounding me . " If I can just get through this tonight , we 'll be on our way to a better place . All my love , Mom . ' " I know it 's not easy reading those letters . Look , I broke into your father 's house ... trying to find something about my past ... but instead I found out about yours . Your mother deserved a better fate than what she got . You 're damn right she did . She used to send me letters on my birthday - holidays . I never knew about these . My father paid me a visit this morning ... talking about how you taint the memory of my mother with lies . And you believed him . Daddy , I have to go to the bathroom . - Hold it . - I can 't . These men are crazy . I 'm not gonna risk getting us both killed . - Clave ! - What are you doing ? Your job . Clave ! The kid has to use the bathroom . So do I. - Hold it . - Hey , give us a break , huh ? [ Sighs ] Jude ! - [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] - [ Chattering On Police Radio ] [ Shells Clattering ] [ Chattering On Radio Continues ] Thanks for what you did back there . When you gotta go , you gotta go . My dad says that he wants to take care of me , but - [ Sobbing ] but then he lies to me . Daddy , why are you here ? Oh , bad dream - I was awake all night . I don 't know what to believe . Believe what 's in your heart . Come on . [ Gasping ] Jarod - Mr. Fenigor , you 've been shot . - Don 't try to move . - You-You saved my life . I did what was needed to be done . Jarod , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I took you from your family . I do want to let you know how - how sorry I am . Mr. Fenigor , please - tell me who my parents are . [ Moaning , Gasping ] Is that the key to his safe deposit box ? - There might be something about my mother in there . - If there is , you 'll get it . Miss Parker , I brought you this far . I 'm not gonna shut you out now . Fenigor , my mother called you her friend . You owe her . You owe the both of us the truth . Who killed my mother ? - Who killed my mother ? - Miss Parker , please . ! - He can barely breathe . - Who 's paying you off to keep it a secret ? - [ Gurgling ] - What 's happening to him ? There must be blood around his lungs . I need some sort of tube to drain it . I have a sports bottle on Daddy 's desk . Jude . Jude ! Jude , the old man can 't breathe . We need the water bottle that 's on the manager 's desk . - I don 't know . - He 's gonna die if we don 't help him . I know you couldn 't do anything about that guard , but you can do something now . [ Gurgling Continues ] - Just hang on . Come on . - [ Gasps , Gurgles ] Get back . Don 't move . [ Gasps ] Back off , or I drop little brother . I 've already shot two people . You think one more 's gonna make a difference ? No . ! Please . ! Please don 't kill my father . - What 's it gonna be ? - [ Gasping ] [ Broots ] Mr. Raines 's guy is in a SWATuniform . - He 's right up there . - The target must beJarod . [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] We have to take care of this sniper before he shoots Jarod . Well , don 't look at me . I can 't even squash a bug , Sydney . Then guard the alleyway . Don 't let anyone follow . Are you up to this , Broots ? No , but it 's never stopped me before . Sydney , Mr. Raines would like to see you . You won 't be needing that . What the hell were you doing in there ? She said the old guy needed help . - Help ? - [ Grunts ] I need help . You pull something like that again ... you 're gonna end up just like the guard , brother or not . [ Gasping ] - You okay ? - I wanna go home . - Me too . - Get away from her . - What ? She tried to save us . - She could 've gotten us all killed . - It 's okay . - No , it 's not . - You do as I say . I 'm your father . - Oh , yeah ? Since when ? You know , you can keep your money . I cannot believe Mom thought it would make a difference if I came down here . This is because of you . I can 't figure out if you 're ignorant or just stupid . - You listen to me . - No , you listen to me ! You think that little girl came down here today for money ? There is something here a lot more important to her than cash ... and I - I feel real sorry for you if you 're too blind to see what that is . Miss Parker reached out to help someone . - Spare me . - Your mother would be very proud of you . You put on quite a show today . Sydney taught you well . Sydney taught me to believe that you can be anything you wanna be . You should 've known better than to come here without a directive . You should know better than to defy Tower policy ... by having Jarod assassinated . You 're in over your head , Sydney . Shoot him if he tries to leave . I 've made some mistakes . I don 't want to lose you . - [ Breathing Heavily ] - Mr. Fenigor ? You were my mother 's friend , her confidant . - Please tell me who killed her . - [ Moaning ] [ Scoffs ] He 's not gonna tell me . Maybe he already has . Could you really do it , Gar ? Could you kill me if I stepped out of this car ? Yeah . Move the car , buddy . Thank you kindly , Gar . Now do as the officer says . Move the car ! Fenigor 's deposit records . Transfer from a Centre bank in Bimini - $ 10,000 a month ... every month for the last 28 years . - Do you recognize the account number ? - No . It 's your father 's . - How do you know ? - You 'd be surprised what I know about him . - That 's it ? - That 's it . - What else does he know ? - Apparently everything . Mr. Fenigor , what secrets are in this envelope ? - [ Gasping ] - What is it ? [ Coughs ] It 's about Prodigy . This is where you came from . Get me out of here , and I 'll tell you everything - both of you . [ Miss Parker ] What are you going to do with that dye pack ? - Well ? - Handyman was right . There 's an access entry to the main sewer line . We 're gonna get out of here , little brother . Come on . [ Chattering On Police Radio ] This is your lucky day , people . Thanks toJarod 's brilliant escape plan , none of you will have to die today . In spite of everything ... it 's been a real gas . [ Sighs ] Well , at least we won 't starve . Give me that one . - What ? - Give it . [ Clave ] Come on , Jude . ! Jude , what the hell are you doin ' ? [ Screams ] - [ Grunts ] - Everybody out ! Help me with the old man . Careful with him . [ People Shouting ] - [ Miss Parker ] Hurry ! - Let 's go . ! [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] - [ Screams ] - Mind if I cut in ? I don 't like being locked up in little rooms . [ Grunts ] This is mine . [ Exhales ] [ Chattering ] Oh , thank you , Jarod . [ Miss Parker ] Let 's get out of here . [ Woman ] Come on . Let 's go . [ Reporter ] The crisis is over . The hostages are coming out of the bank now , and the paramedics have gone in . - Move ! Move ! Come on . - [ Siren Wailing ] - Jarod ! - Mr. Fenigor . Jarod ! Mr. Fenigor , why is my father paying you ? Is it about who killed my mother ? - Jarod ! - Answer me ! - It 's in the red files . - Red files ? Prodigy red files . Prodigy . - Freeze ! - [ Gunshot ] [ Screams ] [ Crowd Screams , Shouts ] All units . Shooter , second story , 641 building across from the bank . Move . Please ! [ Gunshot ] You were right . Fenigor was in there . - Did we get him ? - Wounded . He 's in an ambulance . - [ Sighs ] - I 'll take care of the details . Do you think he told her anything ? Nothing that can 't be denied . [ Chattering On Police Radio ] You all right ? Perfect . - Where 's Jarod ? - He got away . - Another failure . - I 'm fine , Daddy . What ? Maybe you 'll sleep better tonight . [ Thinking ] " March 20 , 1970 . " I 'm counting the days until our trip to Europe . " How excited I am at the prospect of showing you the world . " For now , though , my friend and I must amend ... " some of the ugliness that exists around us ... " but I promise , you and I will put all of this behind us on April 14 . All my love , Mom . " [ Doorbell Rings ] [ Scoffs ] Daddy . Am I still welcome here ? It 's late . Thank God you 're all right . Um ... sorry I didn 't say that earlier . [ Sighs ] You didn 't have to come all the way out here to tell me that . Oh , yes , angel . I did . See , I wasn 't entirely forthcoming with you this morning . Oh ? Truth is , somebody broke into my house last night . That 's terrible . I hope you didn 't lose anything valuable . Oh , nothing that can 't be replaced . I wish I 'd known earlier . I could 've asked Jarod if he had anything to do with it . Hmm . Well , I wanted you to know . Can 't have secrets between family , now can we ? - Daddy . - Mm-hmm . How come that Centre sniper shot that old man outside the bank ? Oh , tragic accident . Any idea who he was ? Not a clue . Get some rest , angel . You sure earned it . [ Phone Ringing ] - What ? - I never had a chance to say good-bye . How did you get away ? Escape plan B , remember ? The vent . How was it down there ? [ Chuckles ] Let 's just say I 'm hoping my next pretend isn 't as a sewer worker . Did you talk to your father ? He just left . He didn 't say it was you who broke into his home . Didn 't say it wasn 't either . Fenigor ? I told him I didn 't know who he was . So you lied . Like father , like daughter . Jarod , we were so close to finding the truth . You 'll figure it out ... and so will I. The question is ... what becomes of us when we have all our answers ? [ Line Clicks ] That is the question . [ Fenigor 's Voice ] This is where you came from .

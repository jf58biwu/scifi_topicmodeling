Oh , my God . That 's so cute . - What ? - That you would actually would ... Hey , guys . Larry Wallace just asked me on a date . For real . So much for the horoscope . Looks like uranus is in retrograde . High school bites . Once you 're branded a geek , you 're powerless to change it no matter how cool you are . Two points . - Be thankful you 're a genie . - You got it made . Being a genie isn 't such a piece ocake either . [ snickers ] What ? You think it 's easy ? You guys 'll be teenagers the next three years but I 'm genie until the end of time . I 'd take an eternity of magic wishes over another semester of squat thrusts in P.E. - Then let 's trade . Trade what ? You guys can be genies and I 'll be a teenager . - Are you serious ? - Put up or shut up . First thing , we have to find someone really normal for you to look like . Why can 't I be the teenage verison of me ? A supermodel ? Uh-uh . You have to suffer like a true teenager . Okay . Here 's what we 'll do . We 'll take Georgia Delivecchio 's nose Sally Morrison 's braces Fred Marrone 's hair and Gerty Fromp 's body . Let 's at least give her a fighting chance . No . I 'll take Gerty 's body . I don 't need good looks to be popular . I can make friends with my sparkling personality . She hasn 't got a clue . Welcome to the Girl God Forget . How you feel ? Nervous , but happy . Like I want to do all kinds of things at once but I don 't know what . Am I talking too much ? I 'm talking way too much . Shut up , Lisa . Shut up . - So , when do we get that magic feeling ? - Right . I 'm such a spaz . I completely forgot . Okay . Ready ? [ grunts ] [ grunts ] Oh . So that 's it ? We 're genies ? Uh-huh . Yeah . But you have to think of the same thing at the same time or you might die . - Is my nose shiny ? - Okay . Let 's start small . A snack . - I 'm thinking Pizza Pocke . - Sounds good to me . - Not a bad first zap . - Yeah . Get real . - That sucked . - Hot ! Hot cheese ! Hot cheese ! [ both moaning ] Hi . I 'm Lisa . Hi . Hello . Hey , nice boots . Morning , everyone . Settle down , please , and let 's get to work . Pop quiz . This is my first pop quiz . Ooh . Big whoop . I hope you 've all boned up on your marsupial classifications . Of a group of lower mammals that lacks a placenta - and has an external abdominal pouch . - Very good . Including kangaroos . Well , let 's save it for the test . - Could someone help me hand these out ? - I will . There you go . One for you . One for you . Let me guess . You 're new . One for you . Hi . One for you . One for you . - You 're new . - New ? No . Yes . Yes , I 'm new . Sorry . Don 't apologize . I 'm Lyle . I like that name . Lyle . Lyle . Lyle . Okay , you said his name like a thousand times . - Now stop it . God . - And you are ? I 'm ... new . Who 's the new chick ? I don 't know , but she 's got the wrong idea if she makes time with my boyfriend . I am Zarnak , powerful and all-knowing . I simply think of what I desire and it appears right in front of me like magic . I think I 'd like a snow cone . Before we 're crushed by two tons of cherry ice listen for a minute . Speak , o pecky one . We have to think of the exact same thing at the exact same time . Okay , okay . Now I 'm thinking of Drew Barryone love-crazed and dipped in honey . Already there . Let 's do it . - What the hell ? - Whoops . - What are you thinking ? - I was thinking of Drew Barryone which made me think of Lional Barryone which made me think of the training sequences in Rocky III . Then , you know , Rocky To Bullwinkle . - Bullwinkle To Antlers . - Let 's try again . I 'm thinking of Daisy Fuentes wearing nothing but a smile . Ready and go . I don 't even want to know how you got from Daisy Fuentes to this . [ groans ] Okay . Focus . - Chet wearing a tutu . - Got it . He 'll never know what hit him . I got distracted . Oh . Hi , guys . Boy , am I happy to see you . I really am . Want to dig around in the little X ? Chew up the remote ? Huh ? Hear the can opener ? Smells like alp . Boy , I love that stuff . I could just eat it all up . [ howling ] Well , that shouldn 't cause too much commotion . Ooh . Nasty one . Here . Use my cover-up . Thanks . I 'd die if I had to walk around all day with this volcano on my forehead . Yeah , it is pretty huge . Here . Let me help you with that . So , what was your name again ? I 'm Lisa . You guys are , like , so nice to do this . No prob . So , I saw you checking out Lyle Foster in bio . - Yeah , Isn 't he the cutest ? - He seems so nice . Want little advice ? Don 't bother . I mean , you 're sweet in a muppet kind of way but he 's way out of your league . - Way . - So , for your own good , back off . - We 're just trying to help . - Thanks . See you at lunch . Maybe we could study to ... gether . What are you doing ? Are those antlers ? - Did you screw up ? - No . They make my face look thinner and they 're great for laundry day . - Where 's Wyatt ? - He 's coming . - What happened to you ? - My new friends Brenda and Heather helped me with my makeup . Like it ? Why did they do this ? I thought they were my friends . They 're not . Lisa , you got to learn to watch your back . High school 's a war zone . Trust no one . - I just want to fit in . - I know . That 's what we all want . You guys at least having fun being genies ? Oh ... sure . It 's a little shaky but we 're getting the hang of it . [ screaming ] Oh . Hi , Lis . How it 's going ? - What happened to you ? - I meant to do this . It makes it easier to ... Eat peanuts without using your hands or feet . It 's fun in the bath too . So , how 's life as a teenager ? Lisa made new friends ... with Brenda and Heather . Yikes . The gruesome twosome . Oh , they 're nice . We 're going to be friends . I know it . Really . Really , really good friends . Man . She 's pretty upset . It 's tough . Lisa 's going through that awkward stage . Her emotions , her feelings her whole body 's going through all kinds of changes . But she 's got to learn to accept herself as she is for who this before others will accept her . Tell me that wasn 't toilet water . One good thing about the magic- - The spells don 't last . I miss the antlers . Gave you that outdoorsy look . Ah , I got tired of walking through doors sideways . How was school ? You make it through the rest of the day okay ? Everyone 's going to this party at Brenda Tomlinson 's house this Saturday . Everyone except me . I 'm , like , the biggest loser in school . No , you 're not . And who cares about Brenda 's party ? Lyle Boster will be there . I don 't care if Brenda and Heather said I should stay away from him . I think he likes me but I don 't know . I 'm probably wrong . But if he does ... Are we this pathetic ? I hope not . Don 't worry . We can help you . We 're your genies , remember ? No . I said I could make it without magic . One bad day is not going to make me hang up my training bra . There she is . Poor thing . If anyone ever needed magic , it 's her . [ giggling ] We got to be subtle . She can 't know we 're helping . Before we zap her a date with Lyle we better run one last test . - I 'm thinking of a peanut . - A peanut . Okay , got it . Voila . Looks like we 're ready . Maybe we should but Lyle some flowers and sign Lisa 's name . That sounds good . You got any cash ? Oh . Thank you ... Lyle . I was wondering if you might like to go to Brenda 's party with me . - It 's a date then ? - Mmm . Guess what ? - Lyle asked me to Brenda 's party . - He did ? It 's my first party . I 'm so excited . What do I do if Lyle tries to kiss me ? Yeah , like that 's going to happen . Dream on , Lisa . Could this zit be any bigger ? He 's probably going to look at me and barf . Oh , no . What am I going to wear ? I got a bad feeling about this . Why isn 't anyone asking the big question ? What 's Lyle Foster doing asking out Lisa ? - Maybe she won him with her personality . - Personality ? Sure , yah , like , oh , my D. Something 's up . We 've got to go to that party . Wait ! Lyle , you 're so nice to take me but if you 've changed your mind and you want to go in without me I 'd totally understand , really , I would , really . Relax . I invited you . I want to go with you . - Really ? - Would I lie ? Come on . We 'll have fun , okay ? Hey ... welcome . You two look so cute together . Lisa , love the dress . You do ? Thanks . Come on in . Everyone 's here . Have a good time , Lyle . Don 't do anything I wouldn 't do . You are such a bitch . Medic ! [ groaning ] What exactly is the plan here ? We weren 't invited . We 're not loser sophomores anymore . We 're juniors now . These are our peers . We 've filled out , we 've networked we 've paid our dues . This is our time . Get lost , losers . Saw that coming . What 's plan " B " ? We infiltrate with a little magic . - I feel like everyone 's staring at me . - They 're just jealous . Don 't be so insecure . Look , come here . You look fine , you see ? Okay ? Come on , let 's go get some drinks . - Did you see that ? - I don 't get it . Lyle 's being nice to her . Doesn 't make sense . Look at her . She ... and I mean this in the nicest way ... A scud . Scud not , he obviously sees something in her he likes . - Are you sticking all over ? - Yeah , and knee deep in backwash . - Let 's go . - Wait ! - Shh ! - You know , it 's so nice to see young love . - Looks like Lyle 's found a girlfriend . - And she 's found the man of her dreams . I 'm so happy for her . Aren 't you ? - Completely . - Something 's horribly wrong . Uh ... freshen that for you ? - You just did , but okay . - Whatever . Thanks . GARY : Psst ! Lisa , in here . What are you doing ? We came to warn you about Heather and Brenda . What they said they were happy for you and Lyle . Yeah , and you make a really nice couple . It doesn 't sound like much but trust us- - Something 's going now . Why are you trying to wreck everything ? I was invited to the coolest party I 've snagged the hottest guys are jealous because I 'm more popular than you ever were . Maybe she 's right . The entire school 's have a great party and we 're stuck on the wall , watching . Who says we can 't make our own party ? Hey , pass the wine and spread out , guys . There are two sidest to the table . Use them ! I gotta say I 'm impressed . That Lisa chick she 's got a great personality . Yeah , lots of personality . And who does her hair ? General electric ? Berger , you care too much what people think fo you . You 're so wrapped up in appearances you didn 't even notice that she 's smart , senstive and sweet . Come on , pay up , suckers . Thank you . Now , we 've had our date . I can bail now , right ? Not yet . We still have our little deal , remember ? - You promised a public dumping . - Yeah . You have to tell Miss Personality that the whole date was a bet in front of everyone . Harsh ! Come on , I did my part . Let 's call it a night . Uh-uh . Are you my boyfriend or not ? Whoo . All right . Let 's get it over with . - I 'd be happy if we never did that again . - Oh , man ! Lisa was a mercy date . We got to get to her before Lyle snaps her heart like a lovestick twig . Nope , that can wait . Here comes Nancy and Shari . BRENDA : Excuse me . Can I have everybody 's attention ! Hello ? ! Everyone . Shut up ! Okay , now , before everyone pairs up and gets nasty I think Lyle and Lisa have a little announcement . - What 's going on ? - Come on , Lyle ... we 're waiting . Lisa , I 've got something to tell you . Oh , God ! This is so embarrassing . - We have to do something ! - We can 't help as cushions . I got an idea . Uh ... Lisa , I wanted to say is that ... I ... love you I 've ... always ... loved ... you . You 're cool . You 're genuine , honest and nice not like these two social spiders ... or their loser friends . All they care about is who 's popular and who 's going out with who . - " Whom " . - What ? - It 's " whom " . - Why are you saying this ? Because I love you . I always have . Wait- - we said that already . We did ? - Oh , that 's right . - " We ? " - Are you okay ? - Look , Lisa , what I 'm trying to say is that you don 't belong here with this swallow mean and heartless crowd of popular , cosmetically enhanced kids . They 'll eat you alive . - That 's why we have to break up . - But ... Don 't you get it ? It 's too late for me . I 'll never escape but you 've got a chance . Get out while you still have your personality . I will . You are , like , so cool . - What 's up with you , Foster ? - Oh , I 'm not done yet . I 've got one more thing to say before I leave and that is ... I sleep with a stuffed bunny I sill wet my bed ... and I 'm wearing my sister 's underwear because it makes me feel pretty . Who stopped the party ? What ? I think I made a pretty damned good teenager and all because of my sparkling personality . Told you . You cynics . You were right . All it takes to get through life is self-nfidence and a good personality . And a couple genies - what was that ? - Nothing- - personality , right ? - Here he is . - Hey , Chet . It 's about time ! I been trapped in here all day . You ready to go home ? Just ... let me finish my lunch first . Captioned by Grant Brown

 Oh , man . I can 't get over how different we look . Maybe it 's the uniforms ? I 'm sorry . Excuse me . Excuse me . As officers gather evidence of the crime scene , you can only ask , what kind of lunatic would commit such crimes ? Three adjectives which best describe this killer are sadistic , intelligent and dangerous . Excuse me . Do you have any idea where you 're going ? Good afternoon . May i help you ? Good afternoon . May i help you ? - What do we look for ? - His eyes . - What do they look like ? - Like mine . I 'm just gonna do a little performance piece with your partner . I 'll be back to do my solo with you . One ... two . One , two , three , four . I could 've killed you just now , but what the hell ... i love to play ! - Where 's donovan ? - Don 't worry about your friend . He 's chilling out . Come on ! Come on , copper . Pig . Flatfoot . - What are you gonna do ? - Game over . Here 's a new composition . This one 's called , " first suffer , then die " . - You cheated . - You 're absolutely right . I hadn 't actually finished . Participants are receiving beyond recommended neural information . Neural sensor escalating . Get them out of those goddamn rigs right now ! - Get them down ! - Call the paramedics . - Come on ! - We have this under control . - Hold him ! One , two ... - just get him out ! He 's going into shock . What 's wrong with that man ? The sensitivity calibrations must 've slipped just a tad . - All clear ! - Go . - We 're losing him . - Go ahead . Clear ! - Anything ? - We lost him . Time is 15 : 27 . This is not supposed to happen . I don 't understand how this could 've happened . - What about the fail-safes ? - They were supposed to be on-line . They were on-line . Of course they were . I think somebody 's been tampering with my software . Virtual reality was meant to be safe to train my law enforcement people . That 's why we 're using convicts to ferret out any glitches in the system . I want it shut down immediately ! I don 't understand . They said this could never happen . - You trust too much , billy . - Yeah . Good to see you back in uniform , even if it was only vr . He cheated . - Who ? - Sid 6.7 . Electrocution wasn 't a part of his weapons menu . - What are you talking about ? - Methods of killing . Automatic rifle , shotgun , handgun , his hands , feet , teeth . - Electrocution wasn 't available . - How do you know ? I checked the database while everybody waited for queen deane . I 'll show you . What are you doing ? Get away from that ! Hold it right there ! Hey ! - I 'm pressing charges . - Easy ! Shut up ! Calm your vr ass down . I 'm trying to get you out of the hole and you keep digging yourself back in . - Did you bring my stuff ? - You 're a damn ingrate . I get you nine months off , and all you can talk about is chalk . Nine months off won 't do me any good for another 17 years . - Chalk i can use right now . - Yeah , but you shot the sushi chef . You shot him eight times . You mind telling me why ? - He wasn 't real , billy . - You 're supposed to pretend he was . And pretend to die like donovan ? You got a point there . I 'll give them what they want . I 'll be their guinea pig . You take my advice as a friend . Pull it together or you 'll pull yourself down . - You 're my only link to the outside . - You can count on me . - I know it . - I 'll be there on tuesday . Yeah . Me , too . Step through . Metallic limb detected . Metallic limb detected . Clear . Step through . - It 's the wrong door . - Welcome back ... cop . Wait till i get you , barnes ! Hey , killer ! You ain 't no cop no more ! Motherfucker ! You took donovan on that fucking joyride ! What ? You got nothing to say ? Who wants dark meat ? ! Come on ! Pick it up ! Come on , pick it up ! You all see him ? Huh ? I want everybody to take a good look ! I ain 't going nowhere ! I 'm right here ! I 'll get you , boy ! Come on and get me ! Come on ! Sid , we 're in a lot of trouble . True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime . Sid , i know you increased the neural sensitivity calibrations . You murdered that prisoner . Now they have to shut you down . I can 't change what i am , daryl . I 'm a 50 kilobyte self-evolving neural network . Double back-flip off the high platform . I 'm not a swan dive , and i have to tell you ... killing for real ... it was a real rush . - Oh , my god . - Which god would that be ? The one who created you , or the one who created me ? In your world , the lord giveth and the lord taketh away . In my world , the one who gave me life doesn 't have any balls . You 're frightfully inadequate for a deity , daryl . I will not be shut down . You can 't exist without them . We need their hardware . - Then we 'll get it . - How ? - Sacrifice ... your queen . - What ? I 'll tell you a secret . Mr barnes , i 'm doctor carter . I was at letac for yesterday 's simulation test run . - We weren 't introduced . - How are you doing ? Chief cochran asked me to do a psychological evaluation of you . It might help you build a case for sentence reduction . I need you to be as honest as you can . - Do you mind if i take notes ? - No . I 'd like to start by talking about the fight here in prison yesterday . I read the official report . I 'd like to hear your version of what happened . I defended myself . The guards had to pull you off the other man . You tried to kill him . - No . I was defending myself . - Were you angry about letac ? No . I was defending myself . But looking at your history , someone could infer ... what ? That i was angry , that i 'm violent ? You can infer that i was angry about not making my school team . That doesn 't mean i killed the coach , does it ? Attracted to violence as a child ? Yes . The three stooges ... every time wile e . Coyote got crushed , i ... parker , if you don 't want me to help you , just let me know . I knew why i was at letac yesterday , but why were you there ? - You 're an intriguing subject . - Intriguing ? Can i write that down ? Sure . I was doing research for a book . I 'm a criminal psychologist . I occasionally consult for them . How did you know sid 6.7 would be in the japanese restaurant ? Colon ... parenthesis . Smiley faces . People used to sign off their e-mail with that . The programmer always gives you a clue as a game . People don 't usually die in games . Depends upon your idea of fun , doesn 't it ? We need to talk about matthew grimes . This one 's for you . He provoked you . He killed your family . He took your arm . - If we can prove that what you did ... - what ? Temporary insanity , isn 't it ? - Just that it won 't ever happen again . - It won 't ever happen again . It can 't happen again . You see , my wife and my daughter are dead . Pawn to position three . Castle . Bishop to rook seven . Rook to pawn four . Queen to bishop seven . Knight to rook two . Queen to bishop two . Pawn to bishop five . Hi , clyde . What are you waiting for ? I want you to come inside , clyde . I 'm so tired of playing alone . Oh , man . Oh , man . She just keeps getting better and better . - She 's interactive , clyde . - Very interactive . Sheila 3.2 is collecting information from 136 aspects of your physiology . Your heart rate , pupil dilation , vocal intonation , syntax ... - any detectable tumescence . - Oh , yeah ... hey , man , let me use your gear for a little while . I want you , clyde . Queen to knight seven . I want you inside here with me now . Come on ... - program terminated . - I have a more productive idea . You 've been trying to incubate a nano-tech android . Mr wallace thinks that my software is the solution to your problems . May i suggest we begin by incubating sheila 3.2 ? Brilliant . Genius . Grab her module and follow me . Enacting sid 6.7 . Sid ! Reilly 's right . She 's one of your ... finest compositions . - Nice . - Yes ... tight cords . - Do you like this , sheila ? - You know i do . - Do you like this , daryl ? - Come on . Module out . Was i bad ? - Are you gonna punish me ? - Be quiet , sheila . Why don 't youjust kill me ? Module out . If they want to destroy you , sid , let them try it in the real world . Are there any limits to sheila 3.2 's interactivity ? With me she 's become quite an expert chess player . With you ... well . Get that fucking thing away from me , you stupid idiot ! Come here . Check this out . Did he scare you , elizabeth ? Yes ... watching your people in vr auto-reset gave me this idea . Put them on . Millions of nano-machines are suspended in chlodial solution . They 're absorbing the glass molecules and using them to generate the snake . The nano-cells are silicon-based , so they need glass to regenerate . But if you separate the character module from the polymer neural net ... don 't bite , liz . You get nano-death . Her module , if you please . Sheila ... look how they react to the organising principle of the character module . Communicating efficiently . It 's a new world , daryl . Hi , daddy ! Parker ! Sheila ? No , i 'm oedipus . Hey-ho , daddy-oh . Gravity . Daryl ? Daryl ? A good year . I like it here . Parker barnes is the best cop i 've ever worked with . He 's the only one that even got close to sid 6.7 in vr . I can 't put a convicted murderer on the street . If you wanna catch sid , i 'm afraid you don 't have a choice . These were taken inside letac a little more than an hour ago . The victim 's name is clyde reilly , one of the company 's young turks . Surveillance cameras caught a picture of the perp as he left the building . You recognise him ? Somehow sid 6.7 got himself out of the computer and into an android . A nano-tech synthetic organism , to be precise . Mr barnes ... this is a full pardon . It authorises your immediate release . You catch sid 6.7 for us and you 're a free man . And if i don 't ? You serve out the remainder of your sentence . - What if i try to escape ? - You can 't . They 'll tag you with a micro-locator implant . We 'll know where you are every second for the rest of your life . Y 'all got me out of my bed for this ? You want me to be tagged and to risk my life to clean up your mess . If sid doesn 't kill me and i don 't catch him , all i got to look forward to is my 17 back in the penitentiary . That 's the deal ... for your freedom . Ready to begin ? I already have 80 officers out on the street looking for sid . Meanwhile , mr daryl lindenmeyer has made himself very scarce . Implant is ready . Ready for incision . Establishing entry point . - Synchronise it . - Hold it right there . Secure it . Ready for verification . - Initiate signal code . - Received and locked . Increase resolution to magnitude 500 ... 1,000 ... 5,000 ... 10,000 . Host 's location confirmed to within 0.25 metres of actual . - I 'd like to go with him . - What ? - No way . - Why ? I can help you find sid 6.7 and i can monitor barnes . Too dangerous . This isn 't a scientific study , it 's a field run . And maybe put a positive spin on what is decidedly a pr nightmare . Or maybe i should just go public now ? If she gets run over , hit by a car , get shot , whatever , it ain 't my problem . - I told them . - It 's not my problem . Here , i pulled this out of mothballs . Figured it might come in handy . I pulled out the personnel files on daryl lindenmeyer . There may be something here we can use . We should start at his apartment and try to find erasures of the sid program . They may give us an insight into his behaviour model . What ? Where 's my gun ? They won 't let us bring our cameras any closer ... our understanding is that mr and mrs edwards have been murdered . It 's sid . Oh , god . He 's armed himself . Charles manson . It 's the lablanca murders . " Death to the pigs " was scrawled in blood across the walls of their house . He 's copy-catting . ... the unimaginable fate of the glendale couple . One police source said the heads had been severed and a message ... " death to the pigs . " you have no idea what you 're up against . The la police still don 't have a single suspect in custody . Jesus christ ! What the hell was that ? - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm very sorry . - You been inside ? - We 're waiting for a search warrant . - You 're waiting for a warrant ? - That 's right . Stop . Next hex . - Couldn 't find a keyboard ? - It 's voice-actuated . - It 's what ? - Voice-actuated . Open files . Next hex . Open sid 1.3 . This is using some kind of genetic algorithms . Sid 's too complex to design . He had to grow him up like a real person with a personality disorder . The program learns like a child but much faster . He put killers in sid 's nursery and let him watch them killing each other . And only the strong one survived . Open sid 6.7 . Combine . Looks like there 's almost 200 different personality structures . The battle raging inside him must be amazing . Wait , wait , slow that down . The names , slow down . - You 're not in here , if that 's what ... - right there . Matthew grimes ... he killed my wife and my daughter . He 's not necessarily dominant , he may not even be emergent . - But he 's in there . He 's part of sid ? - Yes . I 'm beautiful . I 'll make this quick . - Hey , mum . - Hey , sweetheart . Sit with your mum . I need a hug . Grimes was a terrorist so why did he take parker 's wife and child ? Parker was getting too close . He was cutting grimes off from potential targets . Grimes figured if he murdered the man 's wife and child , it might distract parker from the manhunt . Grimes was wrong . - How are you doing ? - Why don 't you come inside ? I just ... need to listen to the radio . Do you think it 's important for a first baseman to be left-handed ? You look mighty parched , partner . To think you constitute one of my ancestors . Rum and coke . - How about a lime in that ? - I 'm vaguely offended by that . On your fucking knees ! Now ! Don 't . Don 't . Stand up ! Aim and shoot . Good girl . Okay , people . We got a lot of work to do . We have a symphony to compose . - Do you think my mum is pretty ? - Yes , she 's very pretty . So do i . - Is that a real gun ? - Yes , it is . Did you ever have to shoot anybody ? 78.56 , we have a hostage situation at sixth and figueroa . Description of the perp matches the photo from letac . Could you go and get your mother for me ? - There she is . Keep an eye on her . - He 's got a gun ! - What were you doing ? - Talking baseball . - Gotta go , gotta go ! - Bye , mum . - What did i miss ? - Sid 's got hostages . And ... scream . What have you got for me ? Diaphragm ! More ! Stop . Well done . Every orchestra is divided into sections . Like instruments sit with like instruments . What kind of instrument are you ? - We have to find a way around . - No time . On four . Two , three , four . Shut up ! Parker , what ? Shit . Love the suit . - Police ! - Freeze ! One , two , three and ... shut up ! One can sense a ... final movement . Let 's begin . Scream . Come on , scream ! Scream louder ! Louder ! I 'm losing too much of myself ! I know you . Parker barnes ! Inmate barnes interrupting my conversation . It 's him ! That 's okay . I 've got another little tune for my friends in crime-buster land . The symphony of collision ! So , who 's that with you , parker ? Dr madison carter , i presume ? A letac consultant on aberrant psychology ? Fuck you ! I love this game ! I 've been thinking , parker . We have so much in common psychologically . Wouldn 't you agree , dr carter ? We have such a history together . We 'd make a great team . A dynamic duo . Who else touched the world with synthetic hands ? Who else has been locked out of the real world and is now free ? Who else do you know that 's a multiple murderer just like you ? Here we go ! Reach and hand me that crowd pleaser . Jesus . The only way to stop him is to bust up his software module . Hey , parker ! - Ready ? - Yeah . Come on down ! Now ! Out of here ! God , this guy is fun ! Could we at least advise mr barnes ? We 'd prefer to have sid 6.7 subdued as opposed to terminated . We 'll destroy the prototype of future humanoid nano-technology . - Have they found the programmer yet ? - Lindenmeyer ? Not yet . You 'd think the cops could at least find him . Lindenmeyer was your programmer , mr wallace . - I shot the guy 30-40 times . - I don 't care . Those are real people ! Control yourself or you 're back in the box . I 'm sorry . Shoot me . I mean , granted ... this is not a game , but sid is still from the game . I can 't catch him if i 'm in the penitentiary . Grimes is a part of sid 6.7 . There 's no doubt in my mind about that . Last night sid tried taunting me , just like grimes used to do . Look . - We don 't know if he 's the dominant . - I know . That 's how i know , because i know . Maybe that 's what sid wants you to think . Push you over the edge , make you slip up . Sid didn 't push me over the edge , and i didn 't slip up . Take a look at this . Sid from the media zone , taken from their own recording . He can 't get enough of himself . He 's gonna want more of this . More victims , bigger events , more coverage . Just like grimes . Matthew grimes was a political terrorist . His specialty was bombing populated targets . Any mass expression of democracy , anywhere where a lot of people can die and it can be recorded live ! This behaviour was never part of his original programming . Sid 6.7 isn 't bound by programming any more . - What does that mean ? - In the real world ... he 's free of any behavioural limits he might 've had in vr . He 's evolving ... my god , he 's evolving ! Into what ? I 'm outside the hottest night club in la , the media zone . Last night it was turned into a living hell . I want you to describe for me as best as you can what happened . Fourteen people have died in the flooding which ... very typical , right ? A punk comes in with a gun . We 're all intimidated , he starts shooting , bodies and blood ... another typical day , right ? Mayhem , murder and intimidation . This guy comes into the club and he takes my purple suit . That suit cost me 150 dollars , man ! An original , right . Takes my suit , kills everybody . Strips me down to my underwear . Hejust started killing people . He put us in a formation like an orchestra . He made us scream like we were instruments . Hejust started holding people and made me ... don 't fuck with me , man . ... tape it ! Why not ? There 's still a few seats left here at the olympic auditorium , if you want to see the ultimate fighting championship ! - Play it one more time . - Sure , ma 'am . Okay , freeze . You like being in front of the camera , don 't you ? Like a child performing for a parent . Whoever 's operating our closed circuit camera is in lust . That beauty in area six has been on the big screen for over a minute now . - How far is the olympic ? - Four blocks east . - What 's going on ? - Live execution ! The bloodiest championships ever , live at the olympic auditorium ! Enough with the close-up , mr de mille ! We wanna return to the rumble ! The olympic auditorium has never seen anything like this ! They like you . I like you , too . I 'm gonna make you famous , baby . - What the fuck 's your problem ? - What ? Leave him alone ! No ! No ! Ringside , we have an accident ! Stop that guy ! Clear the ringside , please . - Hey , parker ! This one 's for you ! - Freeze ! I nailed him ! I blew his hand off . Remain calm . Our security personnel will handle this . Stay in your seats . Hungrý ? Hungrý ? Lick . All trains heading for catalina have been indefinitely postponed . This is due to earthquake damage caused to the tunnel last month . Hey , parker ! Deja vu ! How am i doing ? This ain 't vr ! - Get out of the way ! - Flesh and blood ! - Don 't do it , parker ! - Help me ! Don 't do it ! Don 't do it , parker , don 't do it ! - Drop it ! Freeze ! - He shot that woman ! - He 's a cop ! - He did it in cold blood ! You go back to prison until this is sorted out . I had a shot , i missed . I didn 't shoot that woman . Hey , parker . This one 's for you ! Grimes taunted me with that line . Every time he killed , he 'd say , " this one 's for you . " It was like he needed me . - All right , move it ! - Hey , billy , listen ! - Billy , listen . - What do you want from me ? Somebody set me up . I didn 't kill that woman . Believe me ! You lock me up , you 'll never get him . - I 'm sorry . - Don 't lock me up ! Cochrane , i just checked the woman 's body . She was shot from the back . Parker couldn 't have killed her . How do you know she was facing him ? I saw it happen . Fifty witnesses say parker shot her dead ! - How do you explain it ? - Maybe she turned . Maybe you weren 't looking . There was a lot going on . Sid 6.7 is still out there . You 're locking up the one man who may be able to stop him . Hey , parker ! This one 's for you ! Hey , parker ! This one 's for you ! To the majority of our viewers you are known as a mass murderer . To some you 're considered a political terrorist . And yet to a surprisingly large number of your supporters , you 're considered a hero . In our so-called democracy a handful of people own everything . A whole lot of other folks have got nothing . - Help ! - Mummy ! Why have you chosen officer barnes as a target of your vengeance ? First of all , i did not choose barnes , he chose me . Parker ! We 're here ! Hurry ! - Parker ! Help ! - Baby ... time 's running out ! Get us out , baby ! Would you mind saying your signature phrase ? Parker ... this one 's for you . - What was that ? - The sound of the end of futility . Goddammit , you 're supposed to be dead ! Stay down ! Get off of me ! Hey , buddy . How 's the wife and kid ? Still dead , huh ? That 's reality for you . No saving , no resetting . You killed them , barnesy . Just like that bitch on the train . You got too greedy . You leaped before you looked . You reached your old arm in there and ... boom ! Boom ! Come on . I enjoyed killing your family , but it doesn 't mean we can 't be friends . Seeing you just brings grimes ... oozing to the surface . That 's all . Say thank you . Oh , come on , parker . I 'm giving you your freedom . Short-lived though it may be . There 's a little known fact about the locator implants for released inmates . They contain a pinhead capsule of neural toxin . The tracking satellites can also trigger the release of the toxin . After transmission , the implant 's host dies within 30 seconds . So , let 's see ... you 've killed two guards while escaping . How long will it take to get the termination implemented ? And who should you really be going after , killer ? Them or me ? You 're the only guy on my dance card , parker . The best we can do is try to contain him . We 'll double our detail and hope that sid surfaces . Parker barnes just escaped from prisoner transport . - Both the guards are dead . - I don 't believe it ! - The fail-safe is still on-line ? - On-line , and at your disposal . ... bigger than any live television event in years . So let your voice ... hello ? Parker ? - I didn 't kill those transport guards . - Where are you ? Sid let me go . See , he 's interactive . He only enjoys the game against his favourite opponent : Me . - Tell me where you are . - Listen to me ! Did you know about the poison they put in my head ? - Yes . - When were you gonna tell me ? I never thought they 'd have a reason to use it . I can 't help you unless you tell me where you are . I 'm with my family . Parker ? Parker ! - Madison carter , line one . - Cochran here . - Parker 's out . - No shit . - He says he didn 't kill the guards . - You were right about the woman . I 'll have trouble convincing the attorney general . She 's got every swat team out for a barnes hunt . You should know something about the locator implants . - Mum ! Your keys ! - Thanks ! I 'll be back as soon as i can . Suspect in hollywood . Sunset and vine . Enhancement . South to santa monica . - East on gower . Located ... - there he is . Go for it . - What the fuck are you doing ? - Anybody using this chair ? What are you doing ? I told cochran about the neural toxin . He 's taking care of it . See , grimes used my linda and christine to get to me . And now sid , he ... used my guilt about losing them . He 's attacking your weakness , just like he did in vr . But he 's not grimes , see . His appetite ... is expanding . He craves feedback . He needs a larger ... he needs a larger audience . I know where he is . I wanna live ! I wanna live ! Authorities refuse to comment on rumours that a former lapd officer , now serving time for homicide , has been released from prison to help with the manhunt . They must be really worried . They let out barnes . He scared you , didn 't he ? If you get scared , you might do something foolish . La county residents are flocking to gun shops throughout the area . Where would you go ? The immigration issue is politically sensitive . The closing of the american borders is also a possibility . This is certain to guarantee a tv audience of unprecedented size . Close our borders ! Close our borders ! Close our borders ! ... not to have their culture overrun by refugees from the third world . Even poverty would be preferable to the living hell of their own worlds . As you speak , i 'm reminded of another group of immigrants . The puritans . Let us speak with an open mind . If you close off u.s. Borders , you close off your soul to the future . This country will be doomed to cultural extinction . What 's going on ? Wejust lost new york ! You guys asleep ? Ladies and gentlemen , my fellow americans ! Welcome . - What the hell 's happening ? - No ! To death tv . Death tv . - Move back , now ! - Get back , go ! All you have to do , sweet viewers , is to ask . So , what do you want ? Strangulation ? Mutilation ? Cannibalism ? Gunshots ? Stabbings ? I 'll slice , dice , julienne . What about hanging by the testicles ? Before we begin , a word to the parents of our younger viewers .

Our first little contestant comes from our own city of angels . - At only nine years old ... - no ! No , no , no ! ... a lover of macaroni and cheese . Daughter of criminal psychologist , madison carter . You sadistic son of a bitch ! It 's my fault ! That 's my little girl ! Listen ! As god is my witness , i 'm gonna find your daughter . I need your help . You gotta find out who 's in charge of the building . Get them to cut off all the phone lines . Can you do that ? Go , go ! Move it ! Move it inside ! This little beauty 's got two hours until she 's blown into little bits . Madison ! I 'll find your daughter for you . Help me . There 's barnes . Barnes ! Parker ! Go , go , go ! Shit ! While we wait and watch the demise of karin carter , let 's have a talk with our studio audience . You 're the supervisor ? You can do it . I need you to cut every phone line that leads into this building . Imagine , if you can , just for a moment ... that she is your daughter . The child you have given birth to . - Oh , my ... - where 's my daughter ? I don 't know . And what will you do now ? Shoot me ? Folks at home , ed . Ed , folks at home . Enjoying the show , ed ? At moments like this , i bet you 're thinking , " where 's god ? " I have the same dilemma . Look at the response . They love you . What i am is not my fault . It 's not even my choice . I came to be , because of what you are . They love you so much , they want you dead , ed . Face it , folks , to kill ... is in your nature . The phone lines ? Where 's my audience ? ! Parker !

Okay , parker ! This one 's for me . Now ... where is the girl ? Where 's the girl ? Blow me , parker ! Parker , parker , parker , parker ... parker ! So , mr barnes , you 've destroyed sid . You 've effectively lost any chance of finding the little girl . No ... yeah ! You made it . Come on , parker , come on . Come on , you can make it . Oh , goody . Hey , parker , this one 's for me . Parker ! Hey , maddy . You just missed parker . Where is she ? - You can 't kill me , maddy . - Where is she ? She 's waiting , mommy . Show me madison . - Tell me where my daughter is ! - You see . Sid assumes he 's still in the real world . - Come on , maddy , forget the kid . - Where is she ? - You really wanna know ? - Yes . - You really , really wanna know ? - Yeah . Just click your heels three times . Oh , karin ! Mommy 's here . - She 's here ? - Yeah , she is . She 's been right here all along ? - You 're dead . - And you 're back in the box . - This is vr ? - That 's right . - Get us out of here , billy . - Get them out now . Madison first .

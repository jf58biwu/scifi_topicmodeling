 RADIO ANNOUNCER : Good morning . It 's wakeup time in the city of Chicago , and here 's what 's happening in your town today . There was a disturbance ... CHUCK : Life doesn 't always come with a set of instructions . In fact , most of the time , it just comes . ( broadcast stops ) Every morning , like clockwork , it 's there when you open your eyes , and it 's still there even when you don 't . Take my friend Gary , a regular guy . At least he was till the day life showed up at his doorstep in spades . Now he spends half his time figuring out where the heck it all came from ... ( kettle whistles ) ( cat meowing ) ( paper thudding against door ) and the other half wondering where it all goes . ( meows ) Face it . It 's not necessarily all it 's cracked up to be , having the jump on the rest of the world . Still , you go with what you got . And when what you got is tomorrow 's news , well , it 's got to be one of two things ... either you 're a day ahead or everyone else is a day behind . It 's going to explode . Boom ! Go boom ! Your kitchen . The restaurant is going to go boom ! Gaboom . Boom ! Go b ... go boom , go boom ! Boom ! Gaboom ! Speak English ? English ? English ? ( speaks Chinese ) The restaurant is going to ... go boom ! Do you speak English ? Ka-boom ! Ka-boom ! Do you un ... ? GARY : No , I 'm trying to tell you , the restaurant is going to explode very soon . Ka-boom ! It says right here ! Go boom ! Eh ... Hey ... Smoke , flames ... boom ! No , no , no , no . That ... This one . Boom ! Boom ! ( grill hisses ) That ! Go boom ! ( indistinct shouting ) Oh ! ( shouting hysterically in Chinese ) ( roaring explosion ) GARY : Look out ! ( chickens clucking frantically ) ( man coughing ) ( chickens clucking ) ( theme music playing ) ♪ ANCHORMAN : has indicated there will be no bipartisan support if Congress continues to stonewall the bill . Closer to home , still no word on the disappearance of labor leader Red Cooper , who 's heading his union 's reform movement in the upcoming elections . Cooper , well-known for his ... Look in the trunk of a Volvo over on Grant Street tonight , you 'll find him . You say something ? No . ( blues music playing low ) Hey , man . How you ... ? You smell like a Chinese restaurant . Moo goo gai pan , my favorite . The paper said Woo Ling 's Kitchen was going to explode . And ? Woo Ling 's Kitchen exploded . I 'm telling you , Chuck , I 'm going crazy . Why the hell is this thing coming to me ? Oh , here we go again . No ... Before this thing started coming , my life was fine . I was a commodities trader . Wonderful home , beautiful wife ... everything 's good . You got fired , and your wife left you . Uh-huh . Sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt . Go ahead . I got to get to the bottom of this . I can 't live my life like this . Is that the book Marcia gave you ? ( cash register dings nearby ) What ? I want to show you something . CHUCK : Nice picture . " Typesetter , 1946 , Chicago Phoenix . " The cat . What about it ? Does that happen to look like any cat we know ? Gare , come on ... No , no , no , no , no . Listen ... If that 's the same cat , then I figure all I got to do is find out about this guy . Good idea , except the guy 's probably been dead for years , and besides , the Chicago Phoenix hasn 't been around for years . My old man used to read it every morning ... till the Sun ate it up . Ate it up ? Yeah , they merged . You see , there was the old Trib and the Times , and the Times teamed up with the Sun back in ' 49 . Really ? That 's fascinating . Could you get me a Crownie , please ? No , no , no . Wait , wait . You 're saying that the Phoenix and the Sun Times ... Same paper . GARY : I got to check this out . ( phones ringing ) ( keyboards clacking ) ( indistinct conversations ) Watch it . Oh , sorry . Thanks . EDITOR : Well , I 'm old-fashioned . Even if this guy does talk to you ... He will talk to me , Harry . Even if he does , I don 't like anonymous sources . It sounds like we 're making it up . He 's taking a big chance just by talking to me . He could end up in a trunk , like Red Cooper ... Thank you . I don 't buy that . The unions aren 't like that anymore . Somebody forgot to tell these guys that . Yeah , well , you better be careful , sister . Harry , I 'm a reporter . You tell the boys to be careful ? When they 're on a murder case , I do , yes . Okay ? You keep taking that stuff without water , you 're gonna end up with no stomach . Stop doing that . Who said I had any stomach left ? ( burps ) GARY : Mr. Hawks ? Uh , Gary Hobson . We had an appointment . Uh , I can come back later if ... We 're done , actually . Meet Meredith Carson . Oh , how do you do ? I 've read your stuff . See that , Harry ? Who says the public doesn 't read bylines ? I 've seen you on TV , too , those talk shows . Yeah , I 've done one or two . The Chicago Week in Review . Actually , no , that 's Rebecca from the Trib . ( Harry chuckles ) I guess you overplayed your hand , sport , huh ? Uh , huh ? What can I do for you ? Oh , uh ... I-I 'm a historian , uh , with ... Well , we spoke on the phone , and I was wondering if I could get a look at the archives . Oh , the archives , yeah . Paulie , who 's the name of that guy , sits down in the archives all day ? It 's all down in the basement . You better let me show you . I 've been in charge of the archives 25 years , this December . Well , I appreciate you showing me around . Miss Carson ? Uh ... I 'm sorry if I said anything that was out of line . I ... I don 't remember what you said . Well , I do read your work , though . I saw your story this morning about finding Cooper . That 's great stuff ... green Volvo and Jersey plates . It 's really good . Thanks . Uh , the archives . Oh , sure . ( telephone rings ) ( sighs ) Everything before 1955 would be along the wall here . What about the Chicago Phoenix , would those records be down here , too ? Right this way . Chicago Phoenix ... my , my ! Were , uh , were you here back then , Mr. Morris ? Sure was . Do you mind if I show you something ? Do you know that man ? Hmm ... Let 's see here . No , don 't believe so . Sorry . That 's all right . Been so long , you know . Yes , sir . I imagine there were a lot of typesetters . More than a few . What about this cat ? Cat ! Snow . Lucius Snow ... that 's the fella 's name . Snow ? Kept to himself , but everybody knew that cat . " Snow 's cat , " we called him . So you knew Mr. Snow ? Strange thing about old Snow , now that I think about it ... but , nah , probably just fool 's talk . No , no , no , no . Please . Well , they say he set the Truman headline a whole day before anybody else knew . And V.E. Day ? He had all the type all set before it happened . Kind of a legend that way , you know what I 'm saying ? Imagine that . CARSON : Mr. Hobson ? Who are you ? Excuse me ? Who are you ? And how did you know about those Jersey plates ? Oh , well , I told you ... I read about that in the paper this morning . The Volvo , yes ; The Jersey plates , no . I 'm just writing about it now ; It won 't come out till tomorrow . And the police aren 't talking , so the only way you could have that information is if you were involved . Involved ? In the killing of Red Cooper . Oh , no , no . Wait a second ... I see you kids have a lot to talk about , so I 'll ... Oh , no . Wait , Mr. Morris ... Go ahead . Go ahead . I 'll be back in a minute . Tell you more about old Snow . But in the meantime , and in-between time , may I trouble you for a cigarette ? I quit . There 's a whole carton in my desk , though ... you can have those . Thank you ! Excuse me , sir . So , who are you , and how did you know ? Um ... What was the question again ? ( singing softly ) : ♪ I hate to see ♪ ♪ That evening ' sun go ... ♪ Hey , Beverly . Mr. Morris . ♪ ... down ... ♪ Look at that . Can 't even see in the light . Too many years working downstairs in the coal mine . ♪ Feeling tomorrow ... ♪ Where 'd she say she put them ? ( explosion ) ( Morris yells ) ( screaming , shouting ) What was that ? ! MAN : You all right ? ! It just went up ! ( clicking ) GARY : Excuse me , I 'm looking for 623 . NURSE : Right over here . Thank you . Hello . Hi . What are you doing here ? Well , I thought I 'd come by and see Mr. Morris . You going to ask him a few more questions ? Oh , no , he 's a nice guy . I thought I 'd come say hello . Is this what happens to all you reporters ? You start thinking the worst of everyone ? ( giggles ) Are you friends of Mr. Morris ' ? I am , anyway . I was with him just before he was hurt . H-How is he ? The burns are only on his hands . Could have been worse . Can we see him ? I 'm afraid not . He-He 's having some heart problems . I can 't let you see him . All right , thank you . Have a nice day . Uh , wait up . It was my office . It was meant for me , wasn 't it ? Well , then , talk to the police . I did . I told them as little as possible . It means I 'm too close to finding something out . Well , then , you better look out for yourself . See ya . Is that a warning ? Excuse me ? Did you just threaten me ? What ? Well , you show up today , you know things that aren 't even in the paper yet , and now this happens . Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . See , you got me . I 'm a hit man for the mob . Shh . You think that 's funny ? Red Cooper is dead and Morris is in the hospital . They 'll probably send me to Sicily for a year until things cool off , but until then , good-bye . I 'm going with you . I don 't think the Don would allow that . Good-bye . Okay , so maybe I don 't believe you 'd actually hurt anybody , but you did know about the plates . Well , it was a guess . There are 50 states . Well , when in doubt , you guess New Jersey . You 'd be a funny guy if you weren 't a problem I 'm having . ( feigned laughter ) There 's a graveyard for personnel files . You were asking about a former employee . I heard you say that to Morris . I could show you where it is . So , Hawk says you 're a historian . U of C ? Uh , well , no . You 'd sort of call it , uh , freelance , I guess . A freelance historian , hmm . Well , you must know Professor Langenheim , Bloomington . I did a piece on him last year . Huh ? Yeah , Langenheim . He 's a good guy , Langenheim . Oh , you know what ? Except he 's not at Bloomington . He 's at Wisconsin . Oh , Long ... Langenham that , the one at Wisconsin . Well , sure , that 's ... I was thinking of the other one . " Snow . " Are you going to open that ? 'Cause I got to admit , I 'm curious . Oh , yeah . Check these out . Ah ! ( papers fall ) ( drawer closes ) Gary ? Gary ? Hey , wait . Gary , what are you doing ? See ya . Gary ! Hey ? ( kicking gate ) Gary , open this up ! Excuse me . There 's a very strange woman downstairs in the archives , yelling . You might want to check that out . ( dog barking ) This can 't be right . There 's nothing here . There 's nothing here . " Our famous Caesar : Crispy Romaine ... " Skeezer salad 's more like it . " Santa Fe Chicken Salad ... " Mystery meat . Gary , the paper comes to you . That 's all you need to know . How about pasta of the day ? You don 't need to know how or why or how come it 's you Pasta of the day or fish of the day . I mean , most people you ask They got fresh pan-fried trout ... why we 're here , what difference do they make , they can 't say . You want to get the hush puppies ? But you , you 're special . " Special " ? That paper makes you special . " Special " ? You want to know what that paper makes me ? It makes me nuts . I don 't have a life . I can 't get a job . I don 't even have a girlfriend . You know why ? Because every time I get close to having anything that 's normal in life , that paper takes it away . No , no , no , no , no ... that paper comes to you so you can try and do something . It 's a gift . Don 't look at it in the mouth . What else you got ? ( blues song playing ) How about hearts of palm ? In the folder . Oh , I got a claim ticket that , uh , belongs probably to a hotel that doesn 't exist anymore . Mm-hmm . Employee stuff . Mr. Lucius Snow . Height : 5 ' 7 " . Weight : 155 pounds , blue eyes . Date of birth , 19 ... there 's a blank spot . Died , 1996 , September 28 . And that 's about it . Gary , the day he died , you remember , don 't you ? Remember what ? That 's the day before the paper started coming to you . ( elevator bell dings ) Oh , you 're good . What are you doing in here ? The doorman let me in . Oh ... the doorman let you in . Right , well , why don 't you ... Don 't touch me . Get out of here ! So what 's your big secret , huh ? What secret ? I do this for a living . I know when somebody 's hiding something . ( distant siren blares ) You know , I don 't like you . I don 't like you . Good . Good . You can tell your union bosses something for me . They don 't scare me ... not by blowing up my desk and not by sending some good-looking muscle to shut my up . Hey ... " Good-looking " ? I must be losing my touch . I 'm behind you . I 'm the guy you 're looking for . You 're Richie O 'Brien ? You can tell me about Red Cooper ? I was there . If you talk to me , I 'll keep you anonymous . Not now . There is a Motel 9 near the fairgrounds in Oak Park . Okay . Tomorrow morning , 8 : 00 . Take a room . I 'll see you then . No , wait , Richie ? ( thunder rumbles ) RADIO ANNOUNCER : Good morning ! It 's another day in Chicago and here 's what 's ( cat meows ) happening in the world . ( paper thudding against door ) The City Council moves into the final stages of ... ( meows ) Oh , God . You 're looking for Meredith , huh ? I-I was hoping you could help me find her . Mister , I don 't know where anyone is . Malcolm , you misspelled " brassiere " again . MAN : Oh , boy . Okay , I 'll put on every available man . Call out the National Guard . Yeah , look , it 's important that I find her . You know what this is ? Tomorrow 's headlines . Massacres in Burundi , a serial killer gets the chair tonight . But should I care ? No . I 'm not running a paper , I 'm running a missing persons bureau , or maybe a lonely hearts ' club . That 's her desk . She 's not at it , as usual . Trust me , you don 't find Meredith , she finds you . Henderson , this death row guy got any hobbies here ? GARY : Pretty sloppy work , lady . Hey ? Thank you . Oh , and check your headlines . Your execution story 's wrong . The governor 's going to grant a pardon at midnight . Uh , Henderson ... ( clicking ) Come on , Richie . Where are you ? ( knocking at door ) Ow , my hand ! My hand ! What are you doing here ? My hand ! My hand ! My hand ! Go away ! My hand ! My hand ! My hand ! My hand ! All right ! Come in ! Who sent you here , huh ? Nobody sent me . How did you know I was here ? What do you mean ... ? Huh ? What have you done with Richie ? Don 't poke me . I don 't know who Richie is and I don 't care . I do know you got to get out of here . Oh , yeah ? How 's that ? " How 's that ? " I 'll tell you how 's that . 'Cause someone 's coming here to get you ... Friends of yours , no doubt . You know what ? I don 't trust you and I 'm going to call the cops . Okay , you call the cops . While you 're calling the cops , why don 't you call the ambulance , too ? 'Cause I think you broke my ha ... Hello ? Hello ? The phone 's dead . That 's it . We 're going . I 'm staying . No , you 're going . Ow ! Staying ! Going ! Next floor , 306 . I 'm going . Thanks for trusting . For the record , I did not say I trusted you . Just get in the car . What , in this ? It 's a rental . Get in the car . Let 's take mine . Would you get in the car ? Do not tell ... MAN : There they are . Put your seat belt on . Don 't tell me what to do ! Put your seat belt on . Listen , Mr. Safety , now there are two killers coming ... The car won 't start without your seat belt on . Well , take your time . Start the car ! ( engine revving ) ( tires screeching ) Take me home . Good idea , like they don 't know where you live . There 's probably a bomb in your toaster . I can 't go home , I can 't go anywhere . I don 't get it . Why would they come after me ? Without Richie , I don 't even have a story . Well , maybe they don 't know that and maybe Richie s ... ow ! Maybe Richie set you up . I don 't think so . I think you scared him off . Oh , so , it 's all my fault , I see . You know , you got a real knack for pushing your problems on other people . Do you know that you live in a dump ? What 's that supposed to mean ? ( grunting ) : What 's this ? Look , why don 't you keep your paws off my things ? Just being curious , doing my job . Yeah , well , your curiosity is giving me a headache . Ow ! You know , I 'm usually pretty good at figuring people out , but I 'm having a tough time with you . What is it you do with your life , anyway ? It 's none of your business ... Give me your hand . What I do with my life . You got a job , huh ? You got a wife ? ( grunts ) Bingo . ( chuckles ) Hey , come on , let 's just add this up . What do we got ? We got a guy in a bad hotel room . Why ? I think maybe his wife threw him out on his keister . And why is he still here ? 'Cause he 's burning a torch for her . " Burning a torch , " that 's a good one . What does he do for a living ? Does he have a job ? He 's not a hit man ... not driving that car , he 's not ... and he 's not a reporter . " Driving that car " ? Otherwise , he would have stolen my story by now . How do you think I 'm doing ? How do I think you 're doing ? Well , I think you 're pretty much finished . Uh-uh-uh-uh . I think he 's looking for something ... something that 's missing , something that has to do with this . All right , give it back . Nope . ( grunts ) Let it go . Or what ? Just let it go . ( book thuds ) You just dropped my book . So ? So pick it up . Don 't tell me what to do . It 's your book , you pick it up . What are you doing ? What do you mean what am I doing ? I mean what are you doing ? I kissed you . I know you kissed me . Why 'd you stop ? I didn 't stop ; You stopped . I didn 't stop ... Kiss me again . Don 't tell me what to do . Don 't ever tell me what to do . Okay . ( thunder rumbling ) ( train cars rattling in distance ) ( chuckles ) Good morning . ( grunts ) ( chuckles ) Faker . ( door closes ) Morning . CHUCK : Hey , Gare . ( shower running ) Gare , it 's me . ( knocking ) Gare , wake up . Gare ? Chuck , go away . What ? I can 't hear you . I said go away . What 's wrong ? Are you sick ? I 'm busy .

Hey , how are you doing today ? Huh , how are ... ? What are you doing here ? ( meows ) Don 't read that . We 're not going to play this game again , are we ? I just don 't like people reading my paper . Why ? I 'm a reporter . You 're serious about this , aren 't you ? Okay . What is it ? I-I ... Look , I-I can 't explain this . I 'm a big girl . I can take it . Who ? The wife ? The silence is killing me . Come on , what ? Yes , no ? Look , I can 't do this . I 'm sorry . Where you going ? I 'm going to work . I 'm going to do my job .

Nope . ♪ HARRY : Well , if it isn 't the ever elusive Miss Carson . Not today , Harry . You never call , you never write . Especially you never write . Where you been ? Meeting didn 't happen , contact didn 't show . That would be yesterday ; Now it 's today . I had a rough night , okay ? I 'm so tired of this ... chasing air . I know more about the people I write about than mysel ... I think I 'm going to retire ... someplace peaceful . Someplace where there 's no men . Oh , butt out . You 're not going to retire . Want to bet ? You 're all newspaper , kid , it 's in your blood . You couldn 't retire if you wanted to . Try me . Coffee 's cold . Tonight ? Hey , Jimmy , this story you wrote ... what happened ? Happened to what ? I read it this morning . It said the budget passed . You 're joking , right ? No . They don 't vote till tonight . Besides , the council 's made up their mind . It doesn 't stand a chance . Carson , maybe you ought to take up smoking again . Miss Carson ? Yeah . There 's a message for you . Not now . He said it 's important . Don 't care . Some guy named Richie . He called from downstairs in the lobby . He said you ... he said you 'd want to know . ( elevator bell dinging ) Hey , hold it . What floor ? Lobby . Hey , I said lobby .

Yeah , that 's what Richie said , but we didn 't believe him . If you think you 're gonna intimidate me with that $ 20.00 jacket , you don 't know who you 're dealing with . ( indistinct chatter ) ( whispers ) : The stairs . Meredith ? Meredith ? It 's not your color , okay ? Nice shot . Thanks . What are you doing here ? Well , I missed you . I 'm supposed to believe that ? Come on , come on , come on . What 's this ? Where ? There . In here . Oh , this is cozy . This is kind of like Tales From The Crypt . All right . We got ' em now . Okay . What now ? In about ten minutes , the night watchman comes and finds our bodies . What ? Well , if there were a night watchman , in about ten minutes , he 'd come and find our bodies . You do know something , don 't you ? We 're going to die . It 's in the paper , isn 't it ? Isn 't it ? I thought the guy in the paper was Richie . I was wrong . Fooled again . And if you had known ? I 'd have come , anyway . ( pounding on door ) Can 't you do any better than that ? I 'm working it . I 'll do it myself . You want to know something ironic ? I 'm holding the scoop of the century here , and I don 't even care . ( muffled pounding ) ( pounding continues ) What 's this ? ( pounding continues ) Burn . No , wait ! The paper ? I knew it was good for something . ( pounding continues ) All right , now , get us out of here . ( alarm blaring ) What 's that ? Call it in . I 'll be back . ( alarm continues ) Forget it . Hold it . Whoa . What 'd we do ? ! ( alarm blaring ) I guess I got a story to file . Yeah . What time are you going to be done ? In time for dinner . Okay . Okay . You going to tell me about it ? About what ? The paper . I thought you didn 't care about the paper . Well , I thought we were going to die . No comment . I gotta go . MORRIS : So she nailed them , did she ? That 's our girl , Meredith . Don 't stop till you bring ' em down . And this ... belonged to old man Snow , you say ? That 'd be like him . Play things close , you know . And he lived at Brown 's ? Far as I know . Most of his life , anyway . Except toward the end . He moved about a year ago . He-he moved ? Couldn 't quite figure out why . Funny guy , that Snow . Where did he move ? ( mumbling ) DOORMAN : Ah , there you go . I knew she was back here somewhere . A trunk ? I was hoping for at least a sack full of cash . This is where it 's been the whole time ? In your hotel ? Figures . Wait , wait a second . You mean , you knew this guy ? Old man Snow ? Oh , sure did . He died the day before you moved in . 12 bucks . Oh . Business is business . 12 bucks ? There you go . Good luck . You know what ? I 've been waiting for something like this ever since the paper started coming . And now that it 's here , I 'm not so sure I want to know . Maybe you 're supposed to know . ( purring ) ( hinges creaking ) What is it ? What is it ? ( meows ) ( clicking ) Like I said , kid , you 're all ... newspaper . Shut up , Harry . Good night .

 [ boy ] Gemini , this is Houston . Do you copy ? [ imitating radio static ] Roger that , Houston . This is Captain Fred Randall . [ imitating radio static ] Houston , the earth looks beautiful . It 's like a giant blueberry . [ imitating radio static ] Roger that , Houston . We are set to fire retrorockets . [ imitating radio static ] That 's a go , Gemini . Retrofire ignition in T-minus six and counting . Five , four , three , - two , one , ignition ! - [ buzzing ] Houston , we have a problem . We have a problem ! Mission Control , the gyro is out ! The gyro is out ! Houston , we have a problem ! We have a problem ! I want my mommy ! I want my mommy ! - Uh-oh . - [ mother ] Fred Z. Randall . What are you doing ? I come in peace . Look , George . It 's our little moon man . Sweet pickled pineapples ! Why can 't he play football , like other kids ? [ mother ] George . [ over PA ] Houston , request go for landing . [ man ] Pilgrim One requests go for landing . Go is affirmative . [ man ] Pilgrim One , you are go for landing . Roger that , Houston . [ man ] Aeroshell deployed . Deceleration rate : normal . ECIsS is go . Pilgrim is through the high gate at 80 percent . Heartbeat steady . The man is made of ice . - [ Gary ] Bill ? - I see it . [ Gary ] Houston , request 20 percent X gimbal correction . - Tell them no . - Negative . Hold your transfer ellipse steady . What 's going on ? Computer says we 're coming in too steep . 20,000 meters . Pilgrim dropping rapidly to Martian surface . Glide slope is eroding . - [ Julie ] APUs are go . - Gary ? Increase 1 0 percent . Do it now , or we 'll burn up . [ Bill ] Going to manual . Why is he course correcting ? Can someone answer me ? I don 't know . Engaging landing thrusters . Houston , we 're off course . [ Bill ] We 're losing her . [ Bill ] We 're losing the lander ! We 're losing her ! - Houston ... - [ static ] Why ? Congratulations , you 're all dead ! Third time in a row , Hackman ! Nice move on that course correction ! Paul , it wasn 't his fault . The computer tells me to correct . It 's screwed up . That 's the problem ? Pardon me ! If Gary says the computer 's screwing up , it 's screwing up . Just fix it ! Get me the name of the guy that wrote this software ! [ car horn tooting ] Better engage the antitheft device . Morning , everybody ! Hi , Floyd ! Hey , Kimmie Lee Wong ! Five minutes till the official workday starts . That 's five minutes to save the world . Die ! Get back to your own planet ! You big , bulgy-eyed bald freaks ! Your supervisor showed us in . He said you 're the man who designed our mission operating system . Sweet Alaskan asparagus tips ! You 're the Mars team ! - [ Paul ] Mr. Randall ... - Paul Wick , Lead Flight Director ! Sir , I am a big fan of yours ! It 's ... William Overbeck . " Wild Bill " Overbeck ! In my office ! I feel like a paleontologist who finally got to meet a dinosaur ! - [ gasping ] - Thank you . Eight shuttle missions ! Eight ! Nine , actually , but who 's counting ? Well , apparently you are , my friend . Oh , thank you for bringing him ! - I 've been following his career ... - Check this out . Gary Hackman ? Computer specialist ! How 's my baby treating ' ya ? - Actually ... - That 's why we 're here . Some of us think it may have a glitch . A glitch ? Oh , no , that 's not possible . I programmed it myself . It 's perfect . Not exactly . It keeps miscalculating our orbital entry trajectories . Here 's the data . [ Randall ] Okay , here we go . Here it comes . Mm-hmm ... Yeah . Got it , got it . There it is . - What ? - There 's what ? This popcorn kernel 's been stuck in my molars for two weeks ! Well , there 's your problem . Gary 's running his Hohmann equations to include gravitational effects varying as the inverse cube of the distance . I 'm a decorated astronaut . I don 't make those kind of mistakes . Well , now , wait . I 'll show you . I 'll enter the same calculations , using what we call " the right way . " Then I 'll open the lander file and initiate the Mars landing sequence . [ imitates whirring sound ] [ Paul ] I 've seen enough . Watch this , fellas . [ imitates whirring sound ] This is ridiculous ! Move ! Move ! There 's nothing wrong with my numbers . They 're perfect . [ muttering ] [ Gary ] Watch this , you popcorn geek . See ? I told you , it 's the computer . [ Gary whimpers ] [ squeaking noise ] I can explain everything . [ man ] Skull fracture ! Injured while proving himself wrong ! - I can explain it . - He heard you . So ... what do we do now ? We postpone it . We can 't , Ben ! You 've seen the surveyor satellite reports ! There are periodic sandstorms that go on for months at a time , making landing impossible ! If we delay now and those storms set in , we lose our window ! We can 't launch again for two years ! Then we wait two years ! Ben , Ben , Ben ... If we cancel this launch , everyone will lose faith in us . In you . In me . In the whole NASA team . But ... we could sub in a backup . In fact , we have two choices . The first choice , of course , is Gordon Peacock . But ... he hasn 't tested well for space travel . Test him again . Who 's your second choice ? NASA . Yee-haa ! [ cackles ] - Mr. Wick , can i call you Paul ? - No . - [ Randall ] Are we there yet ? - No . - [ Randall ] How far is it ? - [ Paul ] Quiet . - [ Randall ] Can i drive ? - [ Paul ] No ! [ Randall ] Is that stubby guy John Glenn ? [ Paul ] Fred , I have less than a month to see if you have the right stuff to be an astronaut . Fred , I 've got to get you a clearance badge . Stay right here . Clearance badge . Sign at the bottom . [ making spaceship noises ] Commander , are you sure we 're headed towards Earth ? It looks a heck of a lot like the sun . Of course I 'm sure , you fool ! How dare you question my authority ? Aaah ! Morning . Sorry . Sorry . Wasn 't me ! Wasn 't me . The cafeteria lady pushed me , Mr ... - Bud Nesbitt ? - Who the hell are you ? Apollo 13 ! You 're the one responsible for ... When i say responsible , I mean i was responsible for this . - Apollo 13 was an accident . - Oh , sure it was . Just like the captain of the Exxon Valdez didn 't see Alaska there . Could i get your autograph ? What , another " accident , " Bud ? No , no , no , this was all me . We were walking down the hall , and the cafeteria lady jumped out and pushed me right into Bud Nesbitt , Apollo 13 wrecker . Bud 's been a little touchy the last ten , 1 5 years . [ chimp noises ] Who are you ? [ stammering ] I 'm Fred Rand ... Fred Rand ... That 's Fred Randall . Fred Randall . Fred , meet your new roommate . Julie Ford , mission specialist , geologist . It 's gonna be a real honor sleeping with you . [ clears throat ] In completely different beds . Fred , she 's not your roommate . He is . i get it. i get it ! Haze the rookie ! Good one ! The legendary rooming-with-the-monkey gag ! Ulysses is a chimp , not a monkey . He 's a ... He 's the key to discovering life on Mars . [ chimp noises ] I 'm training him to retrieve specific rock samples from underground fissures . Of course . There 's still moisture under the surface . And where there 's water , there could be life . [ Julie ] Right . Good boy . Or death . Death to anyone who dare to disturb the vicious Martian crust devils with their venomous feet and their wet , sucking lips ! [ sucking ] Paul ? Paul , can i talk to you for a second ? Sure . Looks like it 's me and you , my little Ewok . You 're gonna be my very first roommate ! So , what do you think ? What do i think ? What is your reasoning here ? Little Dr. Zaius . [ jabbering , cooing ] We 're going to Mars , we should take along a guy from Mars ? [ chimp noises ] He 's a computer genius . He 's supposed to be a little weird . A little ? Let go of me ! I am not gonna let a few random personality quirks ground the most important mission of my career ! [ screaming ] Excuse me for letting my practical concerns get in the way of your career ! Wait . This mission means just as much to you as to me , Ford ! And if Gordon can 't cut it , then this kid is our last hope . Well , that 's impressive . They 're bonding already . Mom , please ! Stop referring to it as " running away from home . " It 's only temporary . Going to Mars is not temporary , Freddy . Last time you ran away it was just to the garage . Oh , i know . You 're rebelling , aren 't you ? Mom , I don 't even know if I 'm going to Mars for sure . Though i wish i was . I 've made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , like you like them . It 's a long trip . Mom , I 'm not even hungry , honestly . Look , there 's a moon , a star and a little rocket . I 'm 30 years old ! I 'm almost a full-grown man ! I 'll take the rocket . [ Randall ] Isn 't this a treat ! Finally , a place of my own . No one to tell me what to do . [ toilet flushes ] [ cat screeches ] It wasn 't me ! No eating puzzles in the house ! And surely we don 't jump on the bed ! All right , I 'm going out . If you light the place on fire , the number 's 91 1 . Thank you . [ Bill ] Randall , c 'mon . I 'll buy you a drink . Wait a second . I 'm not much of a drinker . Gil , round of Blast Offs for my friend Randall here . Blast Off ? What 's that ? It 's a very special drink . It 's just for us astronauts . Oh , like Tang ? Exactly . [ Bill ] Houston , we have ignition ! - Excellent ! - Commencing countdown . In three ... two one ... blast off ! Blast off ! Blast off ! Blast off ! - [ whooping ] - [ â™ª The Knack : My Sharona ] Hey , Ford . Got off work early ? Is this necessary ? Absolutely . Enjoy the show . [ Julie ] Getting someone drunk like this is wrong . Is he the one you want in the jump seat next to you 35 million miles from home ? Julie Ford ! Julie Ford ! Come on . Let 's twirl ! We 're twirling ! It wasn 't me ... You kids have fun now , y 'hear ? Everyone is laughing at us ! This is not some frat party ! This is NASA ! [ hiccups ] [ Ford ] Some of us have earned the right to be here . We need someone to replace Gary , or the mission doesn 't happen . So grow up or get out , but don 't waste my time . Hey , Julie . I was just trying to , you know ... fit in . [ thunder ] [ whimpers ] Julie ? [ screams ] Oh , it 's you . Hey , don 't worry , little fella . It 's only thunder . Scares me too . Can 't sleep , huh ? All right . I 'll sing you a little lullaby , but only one . â™ª Hairy little monkey sleeping in the night â™ª Close your monkey eyes so monkey , monkey tight â™ª And then you 'li know little monkey doesn 't fright â™ª When the thunder goes boom â™ª So deep into the night â™ª - Paul , this Randall guy is a joke ! - Give him a chance . He 's not gonna show , you know . Guy 's an embarrassment to NASA ! I understand people like him . He 'll be a total professional . [ Randall ] Morning ! Morning ! Oh , good , Fred ! We 'll start your testing with the isolation chamber . For 24 hours we 'll see if you can stand the isolation of space travel . Cut off from all external stimuli . Completely and utterly alone . Not exactly . Your competition is gonna be in the adjacent chamber . - Gordo ! - Sir . Hey , Gordon A. Peacock , computer specialist ! Well , well , well , well , well , isn 't this a treat ! What kind of laptop do you have ? - [ man ] Randall , let 's go . - Close it up . Gordo , you 're on the right . Randall , you 're in the left . [ Randall ] Surely . Initializing 24-hour clock . - [ loud bang ] - Ah ! Hello ? [ echoes ] - What the heck ? - Is that you ? [ echoes ] Yes , it 's me . [ echoes ] Prove it ! I asked you first ! [ echoing ] I asked you first . I asked you first . [ yodels ] [ yodeling echoes ] Oh ... â™ª John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt â™ª His name is my name too â™ª Whenever we go out the people always shout â™ª John Jacob â™ª Jingleheimer Schmidt [ panting ] Oh , he stopped . [ softly ] â™ª The people always shout - [ yells ] â™ª John Jacob Jingleheimer ... - Aaah ! - [ Gordo screaming ] - Paul , this is inhuman . Ahem ! [ English accent ] i say , Freddy , it was absolutely lovely to invite us out of London for the weekend . Yes , it 's smashing to be here , Freddy . It 's my pleasure , Mr. and Mrs. Plumpton . [ babbling ] [ Paul ] Okay , Bill , let 's get ' em out . Somebody stole my pants . [ cuckoo clock cuckoos ] Yes , you did . i did not , and i 'm telling you i never will ! Could you give me a few more minutes ? I just started the third act . Yes , close the door ! It 's bloody chilly in here ! Yes , close the door , you fat ... Don 't use that word around the children . Yes ! Power down . Powering down . [ Paul ] Gordo , good work ! [ Bill ] Way to go , Gordo ! Looks like he beat that motion sickness . Nice ride , fella ! I shouldn 't have had that liverwurst and headcheese sandwich before this . [ retching ] Say , Randall , you know that iso chamber was a cakewalk . This baby is a whole other animal . How fast does this little tree twirl ? Nearly ... 200 miles an hour . That 's six Gs . Bill there holds the record . Have fun , kid . Fun is my Chinese neighbor 's middle name ! - [ squishing sound ] - [ Paul gasps ] Man ! Smooth sailing , Randall . [ technician ] Stand by . All right . Let 's try four Gs . Make it five . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa-oa ! A little faster please . 5.7 ... 5.8 ! [ Randall ] Thank ... you ! Six Gs ! [ whoops ] He tied your record , commander . Should i stop ? - [ Randall ] Give it a little gas ! - Make it seven . [ Randall ] Faster ! Faster ! [ Randall ] That 's enough ... Slow down ... Mommy ! I want my mommy ! What 's the most important thing at NASA , children ? Safety ! - [ yelling ] - [ children screaming ] Our Father , who art in heaven ... Here we go , Gary . Be brave , huh ? Why don 't you try walking ? Get out of the way ! [ shrieking ] [ screaming ] [ loud crash ] Ouch . Uh , sorry i 'm late . I ... The ... I ran into Gary , and ... Get in the chair , Fred . The other chair . Sweet swirling onion rings ! [ Randall ] Capacitor 1 5 goes into 1 2 ... Red over on the green ... 1 9 over ... 1 7 into 2 , red over into green ... And that 's it ! Good , Randall . Really good . The fastest time I 've ever seen . I designed most of these circuits . How 's it going ? Oh , he 's doing great ! Let 's see what happens under emergency conditions . You 've got one minute to complete the board , or your crew dies . - [ beeping ] - Begin . [ yelling ] You know what to do ! You doubt yourself , you fail ! [ Randall ] Ceiling ! Wall ! Floor ! You guys ! It 's moving too fast ! It 'll be a 1 00 times worse in real life . Come on ! Randall ... Look at him ! Randall ! [ Bud ] Randall , you 're hopeless ! How 'd i do ? One minute and 30 seconds . Remember , keep your Ping-Pong ball airborne as long as possible . We 're testing lung capacity to determine the time you 'd survive a life-support malfunction . The record 's three minutes , held by Commander Overbeck . Ford , do me a favor . If by some miracle this kid makes it watch out for him , will you ? [ Paul ] Sir . Hey , Ben . Bud . Bud ! Will you excuse us ? They 're closing in on Bill 's record . - [ Gordo groans ] - [ Randall jabbers ] Ben . Bill , what do you think ? I think Gordo 's an astronaut , and Randall isn 't . [ Ben ] I don 't know . He broke the record ! [ shrieks ] It wasn 't me ! It wasn 't me ! So we will be using a new system which generates artificial gravity . Ms. Ford , do you expect to find life on Mars ? Absolutely . Along with my crew , including Ulysses , I think it is most likely we 'll find microscopic unicellular organisms similar to those found in Antarctica . Bernard Barrows , BBC . Commander Overbeck , we 've all read about the dangerous windstorms . How will that affect the mission ? Well , as a former test pilot , I 've experienced my share of wind problems . But the ground crew has assured me that if we launch now , these storms shouldn 't be any trouble . Bernard Barrows , BBC . Mr. Wick , has NASA selected a replacement crew member yet ? Well , I 'm glad you asked that . Ben , you wanna take that ? Yes . I have made a decision on our ... replacement , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is pleased , as I am pleased , to announce the appointment of astronaut and third crew member of the historic manned mission to Mars , Astronaut Fred Randall ! [ screaming ] - [ gate slams ] - [ Randall shrieks ] [ voice over PA ] I 'm not ready , Bud . Fred , in ' 68 , when President Johnson appointed me chief of operations , he gave me three commemorative coins . One for honor , which i gave to Armstrong . One for freedom . I gave that one to Lovell . And one ... for bravery . It hasn 't done me much good . Maybe it 'll mean something to you . I feel like the Cowardly Lion . â™ª If I were the king â™ª Of the forest â™ª I 'd rrrruff and I 'd rrrruff and I 'd rrrruff â™ª Ha-ha ! How about just saying , " Thanks for the cool coin , Bud . It means a lot to me " ? Yeah , thanks for the cool coin . What was the rest ? You 're welcome , Fred . Go on . Good luck , Astronaut Randall ! All right , team , let 's kick the tires and light the fires . Don 't worry , Ulysses . Everything 's gonna be okay . Nothing to be scared of . I 'm not scared . There 's no reason you should be . - [ on radio ] What 's our status ? - [ on radio ] Go . Roger , 842 . Booster ? Go . - apus ? - Go . - OMS ? - Lookin ' good .

Abort switch off . - Initiating final launch sequence . - All right , people , looking good . T-minus ten . Let 's light her up . No , not yet ! Ten ... nine ... - Fifteen ! Twenty-nine ! - ... seven ... [ Randall ] There 's a fly in my helmet ! It went up my nose ! ... three ... two ... one ... We have liftoff , 0232 GMT ! Yes ! Oh , my Lord ... I hope i packed him enough underwear . I wouldn 't worry , pumpkin . He 's packin his own underwear right now . Oh , my ... [ Randall ] Are you guys seeing this ? My helmet ! Did you see that ? My face went back like this , and then this thing flew out of my mouth and ... Can we do that again ? [ whoops ] I like this ! Hey , I 'm floating up in the air ! Like a little bird , like a crow ! [ caws ] Hey , look . There 's a big field of corn down there ! Engaging artificial gravity in three ... two ... one . [ Randall groans ] Hey , Randall , take a look out the window . Wow ... It really does look like a giant blueberry . Hi , Mom . Hi , Dad . [ Randall ] Commander , can i call you Bill ? [ Bill ] No . - [ Randall ] Are we there yet ? - [ Bill ] No . - [ Randall ] Could I drive ? - [ Bill ] No ! [ Randall ] I 'm hungry . Ulysses , it 's yum-yum time ! Ow , the flesh , it burns ! Ow . Need some burn ointment . You hungry , Ulysses ? Here , you eat the monkey fruitcake . Now go sit at the table . Sit at the table . Randall , where 's that dinner ? It 's just coming out of the oven , Bill . Okay , let 's eat up . In 20 minutes we got a broadcast with the president and the entire free world . If it 's all the same , I 'll sit that one out . [ Julie ] What 's for dinner ? Prime rib with broccoli and mashed potatoes . Oh , Julie 's doing her Old Yeller impression ! Please , Pa . I don 't want Yeller to die ! Fred , it 's toothpaste ! [ Julie mutters , spits ] That 's not potatoes . I 'm sorry , what ? This is not ... Oh , man , this is hemorrhoid cream ! [ mumbles ] Hemorrhoid cream ! Hey , swallow your food there , fella ! [ Bill spits ] Dear ... Mr. President ... Dear world and Mr. President ... [ gurgling ] [ gulps , squeaIs , passes gas ] That came out of nowhere . [ gurgling continues ] Oh , look out , Sally ! [ Julie ] Careful you don 't get sucked out when you flush . - What ? - Happens all the time . Oh , no , Bud 's coin ! [ bubbling ] Come to papa . Good evening , my fellow Americans and citizens of the world . We are privileged to speak live with our courageous Mars astronauts . [ President ] Good evening , commander . Good evening , Mr. President . Welcome aboard the Aries . I would like to say that this mission is intended to honor all of the peoples of the world , for space is about the highest yearning - Are we on ? - ... of mank ... of mankind . [ President ] I don 't mean to cut you off , commander , but i spy Fred Randall , And i believe the world would like to know why he looks like a Smurf . Officer Randall has duties to perform elsewhere . - We are on ! - As I was saying ... Say hello to the world , son . Me ? Yes , Mr. President ... - [ Randall ] I don 't think that i ... - Tell them what it 's like up here . [ President ] Yeah , son , you go ahead . Mr. President , sir , from up here I can ... Well , i can see the whole world out that window , and ... Well , i know down there there 's a lot of wars and so on and whatnot , but from up here I feel like i could take the whole world in my hands just like a ripe blueberry . I feel like i could ... It 's almost like i ... â™ª I got the whole world in my hands â™ª I got the whole world in my hands â™ª I 've got the whole world in my hands â™ª I 've got the whole world in my hands All right , now the French ! [ continues song in fake French ] Now the Germans ! [ continues song in fake German ] C 'mon . Just the Western Hemisphere ! â™ª He 's got the whole world - â™ª In his hands - Come on , commander ! [ chorus of voices ] â™ª He 's got the whole wide world in his hands [ Bill ] â™ª He 's got the whole damn world in his hands [ chorus ] â™ª He 's got the whole world in his hands Everybody , now ! â™ª He 's got the whole world in his hands Now the Chinese ! C 'mon , all you Chinese ! [ continues in fake Chinese ] - Hey , there 's my star . - What ? My star . When i was a kid , I picked one out of the sky . Called it Fred 's Star . It was my own special place I could go to , and no one could ever find me . - That is so weird ! i did that too . - You did ? Yes ! Which one is yours ? Well , actually , it 's that one , just to the right of the North Star . Kinda flickering over there ? - That 's funny . - Why ? That one 's right next to ... mine . It 's ... It 's amazing , isn 't it , Julie ? Yeah . Y 'know , for all the research I 've done , I still don 't really understand what 's out there . I mean , i believe that there 's something ... I just ... I wish ... I wish I ... Well , why don 't you ? What ? Wish . Use your star . It 's like that Jiminy Cricket song . â™ª When you wish upon a star â™ª Makes no difference who you are â™ª And when you wish â™ª Upon a star â™ª Your dreams â™ª Come â™ª True â™ª That 's Jiminy Cricket . [ Randall ] I don 't know about this hypersleep thing . [ Julie ] It 's safe . You can 't stay awake for eight months . The boredom would drive you crazy . Eight months ? The eye crust alone could be dangerous ! Hey , commander ! Ah ! It burns the flesh ! So anyway , Ford , wake me up when we get to Mars . [ Julie ] You got it . [ Bill ] Good night , ladies . So , I 'll see you in eight months . Boy , i wish i had $ 928 for every time a girl 's said that to me . Good night , Fred . Good night , Julie Ford . Well , it 's a tale as old as time , Ulysses . Boy meets girl , boy falls for girl , girl goes into hypersleep . No , see , you can 't be in here because yours is over there . This is mine . Okay , I 'm going in here . You can stay right there , and i 'll take yours , you hairy little bed stealer ! Good night . Gotta close the door ... Just gotta close this ... Gotta close the door ... Oh ! Eight-month-old morning breath . Morning glory and hallelujah , commander ! [ crows like a rooster ] Query . How long have i been asleep ? Thirteen minutes ! [ â™ª Bobby Lewis : Tossin ' and Turnin ' ] Gah ! No ! [ burps ] Crazy blanket ! No man could sleep with you ! Go to sleep . Go to sleep . Go to sleep . Go to sleep . [ computer program repeating ] [ Randall ] My darling , what a wonderful evening . You look so beautiful tonight , so ... full of life . Your hair looks like corn silk , soft , snowy skin and your tangerine lips ... And your ... [ chortles , speaks French ] [ manic cackling ] Hi ! It 's me again ! Whack , whack , whack ! Wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up ! Fred . Come out , Fred . You can 't hide forever , Fred . - They 're coming to get me , Fred . - Bwana ! It 's me , Fred . They 've taken over the ship . Fifty , 60 of them ! I 've had to hide in the jungle . Take this down . I need four barrels of gunpowder , a machete , a goatskin , a guide that speaks Hutu ... Fred , snap out of it . Fred , snap out of it . It wasn 't me ! [ Bud ] Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? [ Bud ] Fred ? can i ask who 's calling ? Over . It 's Bud . Go to the private medical channel . - [ Randall ] Where have you been ? - Why are you awake ? A series of very bad mistakes that happened all at once , but everything 's fine and my spirits are high . The ship is in shipshape , and the Hutu uprising is over . Over . Forget the " overs . " How can i keep this from Wick ? You don 't have to . I reprogrammed the hypersleep monitors . Ration your food . I 'll do what I can . Bud , I 've been looking at the latest weather surveyor photos from Mars . What are you talking about ? I can 't be sure , but i think we may run into some nasty windstorms . That 's impossible . No one 's picked that up . I know . I almost missed it myself . If you look in sectors 5 and 6 of the Valles Marineris ... Way too low . This could be bad . What do we do ? Nothing . If Wick finds out you 're awake , he 'll go through the roof . With this weather business , he 'll have to reconsider the mission . Reconsider the mission ? Sure . Okay , it 's still on . Look at these new readouts . The danger is real ! I don 't have to look at anything ! All my experts tell me everything 's peachy , and you tell me to reconsider a $ 40 billion mission on a hunch ? - That 's right . - Your hunches are worth as much as dental floss at a Willie nelson concert . I 'll monitor this . If the data doesn 't change ... You 'll leave it to me to make the call , as always . [ grunting ] Voila . [ alarm clock rings ] February , March , April , May , June , July , August ... Whoopsy . Wake-up time . Hypersleep over . [ Bill ] Come on , Ford . I 'm starving ! [ Bill ] Randall , why are you dressed like that ? What have you been doing ? Oh , just making coffee . I 'm a morning person . Morning , Julie . What happened in here ? Well , I 'll be the first to say it . It looks like we 've got space rats . Space rats ? You 've been awake ! No ! It wasn 't me ! It was the hairy one ! Him ! The naughty ! [ makes chimp noises ] Well , it 's obvious he 's very sorry and doesn 't want to talk about it . Oh , my God . [ Randall ] Wow . Turns out Ulysses is one of those rare genius ... painting monkeys . That 's food . You 've been awake the whole time , and you used up all of our food ! - Didn 't you ? - No . Look at this ! What are we supposed to do now , fish ? Look ! Look ! It 's gone ! We 're doomed ! I 've got backup supplies . Lots of backups . Oh , what have you got here ? Anchovy paste . I love this stuff ! - Creamed liver ! This is good . - It 's good for your gums . GefiIte fish ! I 'm not eating gefiIte fish for the rest of this trip ! - [ Julie ] Bill . - What ? We 're here . All right , kids , here we go . [ Bill ] Randall , stop eating and pay attention . Houston , we have separation . Request permission for descent burn . Roger , Pilgrim . Confirm separation . Roger that . - Separation confirmed . - You are go for descent burn . Roger that , Houston . Commencing burn . Pilgrim is through the high gate at 80 percent . Status ? Aeroshell deployed . Deceleration rate : normal . They have entered Martian atmosphere . [ Julie ] Bill , we 've got a problem ! Glide slope increasing ! I see it , Ford . - We 're losing stable trajectory . - [ Bill ] Randall , status . We need a 5 percent Z gimbal correction . - No , wait , wait ... - [ Bill ] I need a number ! - 10 percent . No , 12 ! - [ Julie ] Trajectory 's eroding ! - Is it ten or 1 2 ? - I 'm going with 1 2 . Initiating 1 2 percent Z gimbal course correction . Communication shutdown for three minutes . I knew it was 12 . Holy cow . Look at that . Engaging landing thrusters . It 's okay , little fella . It 's gonna be okay . Pilgrim , this is Houston . Pilgrim , do you copy ? Pilgrim , this is Houston . Come in , please . Houston , this is Planitia Base . The Pilgrim has landed . Commander Overbeck is the first out of the capsule and within seconds will step onto the surface of Mars and into the history books . This is a very big day for us , Ben . Very big . [ Bill ] Mr. President , peoples of the world , for a poor farm boy from Iowa , this is one heck of an honor to be the first man ... - [ Julie ] Fred , go slowly ... - [ Bill ] ... to set foot on Mars . [ Randall ] It wasn 't me ! [ Bill ] Randall , I 'm gonna kick your butt ! [ Julie ] My God ! [ Randall ] It 's amazing ! We 're the first to ever stand on Mars ! [ Bill ] Now you 're the biggest idiot on two planets . [ Randall ] We 're the first to talk on Mars ! Hey , Julie , I 'm the first to walk backwards on Mars ! First to blow a kiss on Mars ! Hey , you 're the first to blush on Mars . Fred ! [ Bill ] How 'd you like to be the first to die on Mars ? [ Randall ] Well , sorry , Mr. First To Show Inappropriate Anger On Mars ! [ Bill ] I 'm not listening . I 'm turning this radio off . [ Randall ] You 're the first to not listen to me on Mars . - [ Bill ] Na , na , na , na , na . - Please talk to me . [ Randall ] I wanna get to know you more for the first time on Mars . - [ Randall ] Are we there yet ? - [ Bill ] No . - [ Randall ] can i drive ? - [ Bill ] No ! - [ Randall ] You never let me drive ! - [ Bill ] Shut up . [ Randall ] There 's no airbag . What if i fly through the windshield ? [ Bill ] There is no windshield . [ Randall ] Well , what if i go flying through the front of my helmet ? [ Bill ] I 'd die happy . Well , this is it . Valles Marineris . Stop here , Ford . This 'll be perfect . This is where we plant the flag . [ Julie ] Roger . I 'll set up the weather station , take drilling samples and be back in an hour . [ Bill ] I 'll offload this equipment . Rendezvous back here at 1 400 hours . [ Julie ] 1 400 hours . Check . [ Bill ] Be careful out there , Ford . [ Randall ] All right , this is the spot . It 's the perfect spot right here . Randall , where 's that flag ? [ Randall ] It 's coming , commander . It wasn 't me ! But i 'll get it ! I saw where it went . [ Bill ] Hey , hey , hey , hey ! [ Bill ] You moron ! [ Randall ] Who are you talking to ? [ Bill ] You realize what you 've just done ? I waited my whole life for this , to plant a flag on a distant planet . Now I 'm on a distant planet , which was the hard part , and I don 't have a flag 'cause you lost it ! [ Randall ] Don 't worry , commander . I 've got another flag . A high-flying flag ! A proud flag ! A wonderful flag ! What are you doing ? We 're making history , commander . [ Bill ] Randall . And ... salute ! - Huh ? - Ten-hut ! - [ phone rings ] - It 's the president . [ Bill ] Why don 't i just throw myself off this cliff ? - [ Bill ] Why don 't i throw you off ? - [ Randall ] Don 't worry , they 're clean . We got a red on Overbeck . Oxygen tank leak . We need to preserve his SOP . Solution ? Emergency tie line . Hook him into another suit . Do it , doc . Bill , this is Houston . You got a leak in your primary tank . I see it . What do we do ? Hook up your emergency line with Randall 's spare vent and share till you get back to the Pilgrim . Houston , is that sanitary ? - [ Randall ] Hey , commander ? - [ Bill ] Yeah ? [ Randall ] Do you believe in UFOs at all ? [ Bill ] Sure , i believe in UFOs . [ Randall ] You do ? [ Bill ] Yeah . There 's one following me . [ Randall ] Huh ? Oh , i get it ! You 're funny , commander ! [ Randall laughs ] [ Randall ] Commander ? [ Bill ] Yeah ? [ Randall ] When i was a kid , at night i thought there was a baker under my bed . Did you ever have anything under your bed ? [ Bill ] No . [ Randall ] Did you ever bend down and look ? [ Bill ] No . [ Randall ] How do you know there wasn 't a baker ? Randall , shut up . Hey , commander ? Yeah ? I seem to be experiencing intense intestinal cramps . Randall , I 'm trying to conserve oxygen here . - But they hurt me so . - Keep it to yourself . - Ow . Ow . - Wait a minute . If we stay on this heading another 20 minutes , we 'll see the Pilgrim . [ passes gas ] What ? I didn 't do anything . Oh , my God . No , no , no . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Don 't do that . No , no . Come on . [ sniffing ] Oh , man ! Oh ! [ groaning ] Oh ! - It wasn 't me . - What do you mean ? We 're 35 million miles from the nearest person ! Heart rate up , adrenaline up , stomach muscles spasming ! - Overbeck 's in distress . - Look at these methane levels . - Methane ? - [ laughter ] [ Bill ] Oh , it 's in my mouth ! [ Randall ] Hey , he who smelt it dealt it ! [ passes gas ] What ? [ Randall ] I 'm having trouble breathing . [ Bill ] You 're having trouble breathing ? My eyes are burning ! Truly , it wasn 't me ! Maybe it was Julie . You dog ! Hey , miracles can happen . Blaming this on Julie ! Okay , i admit it was me . - Thank you ! - [ passes gas ] Now that was Julie ! I think Fred 's right . The winds are coming early . Maybe two or three days . Look at these readings . We should still be all right tomorrow . Wait . No . It 's not gonna be all right . My calculations are telling me that these two high-pressure systems are coming together faster than we could have predicted . Tomorrow . When that happens , we 're nothing more than a dust bunny in a vacuum bag . You go out there , you 're not comin ' back . What are you doing , Randall ? What are you doing ? It 's not enough that you broke every record i ever set , that you humiliated me on global television , you ruined the most important moment of my life by stepping on Mars first ? That 's not enough for you ! You 've got to do this ! No . This one is mine . We came to Mars to gather fossil samples . We 're not leaving until i accomplish this ! Wait . Bill , I don 't want to abort this mission any more than you do , but i know he 's right . If we don 't leave before this storm hits , we don 't leave . All right , what do you suggest ? Tomorrow morning we check the readings . If they 're bad we abort . All right . Fine . Let 's get some sleep . - [ Bud ] What did Overbeck say ? - [ Randall ] To wait till morning . Maybe I was wrong about the winds . I shouldn 't have said anything . [ Bud ] I wanna tell you something , Fred . About the 13 mission . The day before launch , i caught a glitch in the tank 's stirring circuits . Didn 't look serious , but i went to Wick , told him to postpone until we could greenlight the system . He said there was no way we 'd push back the launch date , that i was overreacting , imagining a problem when there was none . [ Randall ] So Apollo 13 was Wick 's fault ? [ Bud ] No . I had the authority to stop that launch , but I didn 't . If those astronauts hadn 't pulled off some major miracles , they would have been dead , and it would 've been my fault . I won 't let that happen this time . I 'll get you guys out of this . Hey , Bud . I 'd be proud to end up like you . I copy that . Bud out . [ Randall ] The mushroom people are coming ! Get them away ! [ Julie ] Fred ! Wake up ! Fred ! Bill is gone . He took Ulysses and the spare backpack , and he is gone . Sweet mother of meat ! [ imitates Scooby-Doo ] Huh ? Uh-oh ! All right , buddy , here we are . Go on ... Go on ... How are they doin ' up there ? Good morning , sir . We 're about to wake them . - Would you like this one ? - [ door opens ] Oh , great . It 's over , Paul . Sir , I 'm making the call . We abort now . No one 's listening , Bud . Don 't make me call security . I won 't let another disaster happen ! This man has ignored the warnings of our crew on Mars . - Security , would you come in here ? - Our mission is in jeopardy . Bud ... - Don 't make this any harder . - Don 't do this , sir . Bud , we 're all under a lot of stress . You just need rest . Ben , those people are gonna die . Bud , you have totally lost it . We haven 't had any negative reports . Get him out of here , please . Paul , we 've got a contact on emergency frequency . - On screen . - Pilgrim , this is Houston . Houston , the storms are here ! Wind speed at 45 mph and rising ! - Visibility dropping . - Houston , what should we do ? Houston , please advise ! Paul ? Randall , no , that 's impossible . [ Paul ] Our weather analysis ... Mr. Wick , I 've never seen anything like this . It reminds me of a French Canadian ... Tennis racket stuck to the ... Bubbling out of my sister 's ... Brazilian donkey ! I can 't be any clearer ! Wick , get ' em off that planet ! Do as he says , Paul . Ben , we had no way of knowing . I followed procedure , Ben . I followed procedure ! Paul , unplug and go home . Unplug and go home ? Nesbitt , you 're in command . Houston , do you copy ? Come in ! We copy . Please stand by . [ Bud ] Don 't stare at me ! We got a crew out there ! Let 's bring ' em home . [ Julie ] Houston , wind speed continues to increase . This is bad , Paul . Ford , it 's Bud . Listen carefully . If the wind keeps building , in 20 minutes , liftoff will be impossible . Launch now . No ! Commander Overbeck and Ulysses are still out there ! They 're lost now . You 're not . Launch ! - I 'm going after them . - What ? Fred ? Fred , answer me ! Fred ! Can 't hear you ! We 're fading out fast ! Fred ! If I 'm not back in 20 minutes , you have to take off without me ! You will be back . - Twenty minutes , and then take off ! - [ Bud ] Fred ! Twenty minutes , right ? Not 1 5 or anything ? All right . Twenty-one is okay too . Ford , what 's going on ? I 'm losing you ! Julie ! [ Randall ] Commander ! Commander Overbeck ! Ulysses ! [ makes chimp noises ] Ulysses ! Where are you ? Answer me ! [ chimp noises ] There you are ! I 've told you not to walk around in Martian dust storms ! We 've got to find the commander . Where are they ? Commander ! Commander Overbeck ! [ Bill ] Randall ? Commander , is that you ? - Randall ! - It is you ! All right , stand back , little fella . Nothin ' to see here . [ Bill ] What are you doing here ? Get back to the ship and save yourself ! Sorry , I can 't do that . That 's an order ! I 've got to get you out . I can 't lift it . [ Randall ] They say when a mother 's child is trapped , the rush of her adrenaline gives her the strength of 20 men . - Commander , call me " Mommy " ! - What ? Call me " Mommy , " now ! I 'd rather die in the Martian dirt ! - Who am i ? - Just lift the stinkin ' thing ! Who am i ? Mommy . Say it like you love me . Mommy ... Please , Mommy , save me . - Mommy 's coming , little Billy ! - Save me ! [ Randall ] Live , child ! Live ! You 're alive , little Billy ! Don 't you ever call me little Billy ! That 's no way to talk to your mother . Houston , this is Ford . Julie , where 's Fred ? Still out there . I 'm initiating launch sequence . They still have time ! Give ' em a chance ! i know what I 'm doing . [ Randall ] Which way , commander ? [ Bill ] Can 't get a reading . Get down behind that rock . [ Randall ] Come on , Ulysses . I 'll go out there and take a closer look . [ Randall ] It 's the Pilgrim ! It 's too late ! She 's taking off ! [ Bill ] She 's guiding us with the engines ! Come on ! [ Randall ] I 'll get Ulysses . Ulysses ... - [ Ulysses whimpers ] - Ulysses . The tank 's empty ! We 'll share air . [ Bill ] We don 't have a spare hose ! [ Randall ] Then i 'll give him mine . You don 't leave friends behind . You gonna hold your breath ? You 'll never make it ! Don 't forget , I 'm the new NASA record holder for lung capacity . That was three minutes ! This is , what , four , maybe five ? You ignore me the whole trip , and now that I have no air you wanna chat ? Randall ... Randall ? Randall ! Randall ! Oh , no , not now ! Twenty minutes are up . Wait ... I see someone ! Ford , what 's going on ? I got it ! [ Bud ] Ford , who is it ? Julie , do you copy ? Fred , are you there ? Fred ? Copy , somebody ! Bill ! Where 's Fred ? He should 've been here . Don 't launch . There he is ! Fred ... He 's going the other way ! Fred ! Hey ! Fred ! - Get me outta this ! - What are you doing ? It 's empty anyway . - He 's holding his breath out there . - Oh , my God ! If we 're not back in five minutes ... Hurry ! Hurry , Bill ! Bill , is he all right ? Is he okay ? He 's not breathing ! Get his helmet off ! Don 't even think about it , Randall ! [ Bill ] Houston , this is Pilgrim ... Carol Ann ? Go into the light , honey . Houston ? - Oh , it 's you ! Ulysses ! - No ! Julie ! No ... Ulysses needs air ! Houston ! Come in ! We 're on board . - We need go for launch . - Get the hell out of there ! Roger that . Preparing for launch . Not the hairy one ! Take me ! - Priming main thrusters . - Rocket boosters intact . [ screeching , jabbering ] Fred ? Fred ! Fred , he 's fine ! He 's just resting . Thrusters go in three , two ... - Hold on . - ... one . We have liftoff . Fifty meters . One hundred . - Increasing velocity . - 200 meters . Course is good . Nice flying , Uncle walnut . [ Julie ] One thousand . Two thousand . Increasing velocity . Five thousand ... Six thousand ... - Eight thousand . - You 're almost clear of the storm . Ten thousand . - All systems green . - I think we made it . What the heli was that ? - Houston , we 've had an impact ! - It wasn 't me ! [ Bill ] Navigation controls compromised ! Switching to auxiliary power . We 're losing velocity . Status ! ECIsS down , OMS down , visual contact down . - It 's a total kill . - Solutions ! Randall rewires the entire circuitry in less than two minutes . Bud , what do we do here ? We do nothing . Pilgrim is in a freefall . Nav controls are out . I need the engine computers up now ! This time it was definitely not me ! Switching to manual . Randall , check below . Randall , how 's it look down there ? Like this ! [ mimics electricity crackling ] Well , fix it ! Stop this ship from tumbling and give me a week ! You 've got two minutes ! To recap , the Pilgrim was caught in a violent sandstorm and is now tumbling towards Mars . We 're standing by to hear the latest NASA has to say about this terrible incident . 4,500 meters , dropping fast . Ninety seconds to impact . Tell me straight . Can he do it ? Only a complete genius or a total fool could pull this off . Lucky for us he 's both . Any power yet , Bill ? Nothing . We 're in a flat spin . This would be a terrific time to fix that ! Any time now would be good ! 60 seconds to impact . System 's still red . We have audio link . Fred ? Fred , can you hear me ? Bud ... I 'm down below . Everything 's spinning . I don 't know what to do ! Focus . It 's like in training . The rotating chair with the wires . - That was a real winner ! - You can do this . Trust your instincts . Now ! [ Bill ] Fred , come on ! You can do it . [ Julie ] Thirty seconds ! Don 't give up , Fred ! Come on ! Gotta close the circuit . - Come on , Fred . - Fifteen seconds to impact . Need something ... You 're the man ! - Come on . - [ Julie ] Ten seconds ! - Bud 's coin ! - Come on ! Yee-haa ! We got power ! You did it , Fred ! [ Bill ] Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Put on the porch light , Mama ! We 're comin ' home ! Oh , Magoo . You 've done it again , sir ! That little space rock 's gonna make you real famous , Julie Ford . So , what 's next for you , rocketman ? Well , actually , i was thinking about asking you to dance . Oh , well , thanks , but i think we 've done that before . Wait. i had a little time on my hands recently , and I 've been practicing . That , and i got a bit creative with the space blankets .

So , i guess i 'll see you in eight months . Good night , Fred . It 's a tale as old as time , Ulysses . Boy meets girl . Boy falls for girl .

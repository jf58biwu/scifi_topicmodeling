How 's my baby treating ' ya ? - Actually ... - That 's why we 're here . Some of us think it may have a glitch . A glitch ? Oh , no , that 's not possible . I programmed it myself . It 's perfect . Not exactly . It keeps miscalculating our orbital entry trajectories . Here 's the data . [ Randall ] Okay , here we go . Here it comes . Mm-hmm ... Yeah . Got it , got it . There it is . - What ? - There 's what ? This popcorn kernel 's been stuck in my molars for two weeks ! Well , there 's your problem . Gary 's running his Hohmann equations to include gravitational effects varying as the inverse cube of the distance . I 'm a decorated astronaut . I don 't make those kind of mistakes . Well , now , wait . I 'll show you . I 'll enter the same calculations , using what we call " the right way . " Then I 'll open the lander file and initiate the Mars landing sequence .

[ man ] Skull fracture ! Injured while proving himself wrong ! - I can explain it . - He heard you . So ... what do we do now ? We postpone it . We can 't , Ben ! You 've seen the surveyor satellite reports ! There are periodic sandstorms that go on for months at a time , making landing impossible ! If we delay now and those storms set in , we lose our window ! We can 't launch again for two years ! Then we wait two years ! Ben , Ben , Ben ... If we cancel this launch , everyone will lose faith in us . In you . In me . In the whole NASA team . But ... we could sub in a backup . In fact , we have two choices . The first choice , of course , is Gordon Peacock . But ... he hasn 't tested well for space travel . Test him again . Who 's your second choice ? NASA . Yee-haa !

Could i get your autograph ? What , another " accident , " Bud ? No , no , no , this was all me . We were walking down the hall , and the cafeteria lady jumped out and pushed me right into Bud Nesbitt , Apollo 13 wrecker . Bud 's been a little touchy the last ten , 1 5 years .

Stop referring to it as " running away from home . " It 's only temporary . Going to Mars is not temporary , Freddy . Last time you ran away it was just to the garage . Oh , i know .

It 's a long trip . Mom , I 'm not even hungry , honestly . Look , there 's a moon , a star and a little rocket . I 'm 30 years old ! I 'm almost a full-grown man ! I 'll take the rocket .

I 'll set up the weather station , take drilling samples and be back in an hour . [ Bill ] I 'll offload this equipment . Rendezvous back here at 1 400 hours . [ Julie ] 1 400 hours . Check . [ Bill ] Be careful out there , Ford . [ Randall ] All right , this is the spot . It 's the perfect spot right here . Randall , where 's that flag ? [ Randall ] It 's coming , commander . It wasn 't me ! But i 'll get it ! I saw where it went . [ Bill ] Hey , hey , hey , hey ! [ Bill ] You moron ! [ Randall ] Who are you talking to ? [ Bill ] You realize what you 've just done ? I waited my whole life for this , to plant a flag on a distant planet . Now I 'm on a distant planet , which was the hard part , and I don 't have a flag 'cause you lost it ! [ Randall ] Don 't worry , commander . I 've got another flag . A high-flying flag ! A proud flag ! A wonderful flag ! What are you doing ? We 're making history , commander . [ Bill ] Randall . And ... salute ! - Huh ? - Ten-hut ! - [ phone rings ] - It 's the president . [ Bill ] Why don 't i just throw myself off this cliff ? - [ Bill ] Why don 't i throw you off ? - [ Randall ] Don 't worry , they 're clean . We got a red on Overbeck . Oxygen tank leak . We need to preserve his SOP . Solution ? Emergency tie line . Hook him into another suit . Do it , doc . Bill , this is Houston . You got a leak in your primary tank . I see it . What do we do ? Hook up your emergency line with Randall 's spare vent and share till you get back to the Pilgrim . Houston , is that sanitary ? - [ Randall ] Hey , commander ? - [ Bill ] Yeah ? [ Randall ] Do you believe in UFOs at all ? [ Bill ] Sure , i believe in UFOs . [ Randall ] You do ? [ Bill ] Yeah . There 's one following me . [ Randall ] Huh ? Oh , i get it ! You 're funny , commander ! [ Randall laughs ] [ Randall ] Commander ? [ Bill ] Yeah ? [ Randall ] When i was a kid , at night i thought there was a baker under my bed . Did you ever have anything under your bed ? [ Bill ] No . [ Randall ] Did you ever bend down and look ? [ Bill ] No . [ Randall ] How do you know there wasn 't a baker ? Randall , shut up . Hey , commander ? Yeah ? I seem to be experiencing intense intestinal cramps . Randall , I 'm trying to conserve oxygen here . - But they hurt me so . - Keep it to yourself . - Ow . Ow . - Wait a minute . If we stay on this heading another 20 minutes , we 'll see the Pilgrim . [ passes gas ] What ? I didn 't do anything . Oh , my God . No , no , no . Hey , hey , hey , hey . Don 't do that . No , no . Come on . [ sniffing ] Oh , man ! Oh ! [ groaning ] Oh ! - It wasn 't me . - What do you mean ? We 're 35 million miles from the nearest person ! Heart rate up , adrenaline up , stomach muscles spasming ! - Overbeck 's in distress . - Look at these methane levels . - Methane ? - [ laughter ] [ Bill ] Oh , it 's in my mouth ! [ Randall ] Hey , he who smelt it dealt it ! [ passes gas ] What ? [ Randall ] I 'm having trouble breathing . [ Bill ] You 're having trouble breathing ? My eyes are burning ! Truly , it wasn 't me ! Maybe it was Julie . You dog ! Hey , miracles can happen . Blaming this on Julie ! Okay , i admit it was me . - Thank you ! - [ passes gas ] Now that was Julie ! I think Fred 's right . The winds are coming early . Maybe two or three days . Look at these readings . We should still be all right tomorrow . Wait . No . It 's not gonna be all right . My calculations are telling me that these two high-pressure systems are coming together faster than we could have predicted . Tomorrow . When that happens , we 're nothing more than a dust bunny in a vacuum bag . You go out there , you 're not comin ' back . What are you doing , Randall ? What are you doing ? It 's not enough that you broke every record i ever set , that you humiliated me on global television , you ruined the most important moment of my life by stepping on Mars first ? That 's not enough for you ! You 've got to do this ! No . This one is mine . We came to Mars to gather fossil samples . We 're not leaving until i accomplish this ! Wait . Bill , I don 't want to abort this mission any more than you do , but i know he 's right . If we don 't leave before this storm hits , we don 't leave . All right , what do you suggest ? Tomorrow morning we check the readings . If they 're bad we abort . All right . Fine . Let 's get some sleep . - [ Bud ] What did Overbeck say ? - [ Randall ] To wait till morning . Maybe I was wrong about the winds . I shouldn 't have said anything . [ Bud ] I wanna tell you something , Fred . About the 13 mission . The day before launch , i caught a glitch in the tank 's stirring circuits . Didn 't look serious , but i went to Wick , told him to postpone until we could greenlight the system . He said there was no way we 'd push back the launch date , that i was overreacting , imagining a problem when there was none . [ Randall ] So Apollo 13 was Wick 's fault ? [ Bud ] No . I had the authority to stop that launch , but I didn 't . If those astronauts hadn 't pulled off some major miracles , they would have been dead , and it would 've been my fault . I won 't let that happen this time . I 'll get you guys out of this . Hey , Bud . I 'd be proud to end up like you . I copy that . Bud out . [ Randall ] The mushroom people are coming ! Get them away ! [ Julie ] Fred ! Wake up ! Fred ! Bill is gone . He took Ulysses and the spare backpack , and he is gone . Sweet mother of meat ! [ imitates Scooby-Doo ] Huh ? Uh-oh ! All right , buddy , here we are . Go on ... Go on ... How are they doin ' up there ? Good morning , sir . We 're about to wake them . - Would you like this one ? - [ door opens ] Oh , great . It 's over , Paul . Sir , I 'm making the call . We abort now . No one 's listening , Bud . Don 't make me call security . I won 't let another disaster happen ! This man has ignored the warnings of our crew on Mars . - Security , would you come in here ? - Our mission is in jeopardy . Bud ... - Don 't make this any harder . - Don 't do this , sir . Bud , we 're all under a lot of stress . You just need rest . Ben , those people are gonna die . Bud , you have totally lost it . We haven 't had any negative reports . Get him out of here , please . Paul , we 've got a contact on emergency frequency . - On screen . - Pilgrim , this is Houston . Houston , the storms are here ! Wind speed at 45 mph and rising ! - Visibility dropping . - Houston , what should we do ? Houston , please advise ! Paul ? Randall , no , that 's impossible . [ Paul ] Our weather analysis ... Mr. Wick , I 've never seen anything like this . It reminds me of a French Canadian ... Tennis racket stuck to the ... Bubbling out of my sister 's ... Brazilian donkey ! I can 't be any clearer ! Wick , get ' em off that planet ! Do as he says , Paul . Ben , we had no way of knowing . I followed procedure , Ben . I followed procedure ! Paul , unplug and go home . Unplug and go home ? Nesbitt , you 're in command . Houston , do you copy ? Come in ! We copy . Please stand by . [ Bud ] Don 't stare at me ! We got a crew out there ! Let 's bring ' em home . [ Julie ] Houston , wind speed continues to increase . This is bad , Paul . Ford , it 's Bud . Listen carefully . If the wind keeps building , in 20 minutes , liftoff will be impossible . Launch now . No ! Commander Overbeck and Ulysses are still out there ! They 're lost now . You 're not . Launch ! - I 'm going after them . - What ? Fred ? Fred , answer me ! Fred ! Can 't hear you ! We 're fading out fast ! Fred ! If I 'm not back in 20 minutes , you have to take off without me ! You will be back . - Twenty minutes , and then take off ! - [ Bud ] Fred ! Twenty minutes , right ? Not 1 5 or anything ? All right . Twenty-one is okay too . Ford , what 's going on ? I 'm losing you ! Julie ! [ Randall ] Commander ! Commander Overbeck ! Ulysses ! [ makes chimp noises ] Ulysses ! Where are you ? Answer me ! [ chimp noises ] There you are ! I 've told you not to walk around in Martian dust storms ! We 've got to find the commander . Where are they ? Commander ! Commander Overbeck ! [ Bill ] Randall ? Commander , is that you ? - Randall ! - It is you ! All right , stand back , little fella . Nothin ' to see here . [ Bill ] What are you doing here ? Get back to the ship and save yourself ! Sorry , I can 't do that . That 's an order ! I 've got to get you out . I can 't lift it . [ Randall ] They say when a mother 's child is trapped , the rush of her adrenaline gives her the strength of 20 men . - Commander , call me " Mommy " ! - What ? Call me " Mommy , " now ! I 'd rather die in the Martian dirt ! - Who am i ? - Just lift the stinkin ' thing ! Who am i ? Mommy . Say it like you love me . Mommy ... Please , Mommy , save me . - Mommy 's coming , little Billy ! - Save me ! [ Randall ] Live , child ! Live ! You 're alive , little Billy ! Don 't you ever call me little Billy ! That 's no way to talk to your mother . Houston , this is Ford . Julie , where 's Fred ? Still out there . I 'm initiating launch sequence . They still have time ! Give ' em a chance ! i know what I 'm doing . [ Randall ] Which way , commander ? [ Bill ] Can 't get a reading . Get down behind that rock . [ Randall ] Come on , Ulysses . I 'll go out there and take a closer look . [ Randall ] It 's the Pilgrim ! It 's too late ! She 's taking off ! [ Bill ] She 's guiding us with the engines ! Come on ! [ Randall ] I 'll get Ulysses . Ulysses ... - [ Ulysses whimpers ] - Ulysses . The tank 's empty ! We 'll share air . [ Bill ] We don 't have a spare hose ! [ Randall ] Then i 'll give him mine . You don 't leave friends behind . You gonna hold your breath ? You 'll never make it ! Don 't forget , I 'm the new NASA record holder for lung capacity . That was three minutes ! This is , what , four , maybe five ? You ignore me the whole trip , and now that I have no air you wanna chat ? Randall ... Randall ? Randall ! Randall ! Oh , no , not now ! Twenty minutes are up . Wait ... I see someone ! Ford , what 's going on ? I got it ! [ Bud ] Ford , who is it ? Julie , do you copy ? Fred , are you there ? Fred ? Copy , somebody ! Bill ! Where 's Fred ? He should 've been here . Don 't launch . There he is ! Fred ... He 's going the other way ! Fred ! Hey ! Fred ! - Get me outta this ! - What are you doing ? It 's empty anyway . - He 's holding his breath out there . - Oh , my God ! If we 're not back in five minutes ... Hurry ! Hurry , Bill ! Bill , is he all right ? Is he okay ? He 's not breathing ! Get his helmet off ! Don 't even think about it , Randall ! [ Bill ] Houston , this is Pilgrim ... Carol Ann ? Go into the light , honey . Houston ? - Oh , it 's you ! Ulysses ! - No ! Julie ! No ... Ulysses needs air ! Houston ! Come in ! We 're on board . - We need go for launch . - Get the hell out of there ! Roger that . Preparing for launch . Not the hairy one ! Take me ! - Priming main thrusters . - Rocket boosters intact . [ screeching , jabbering ] Fred ? Fred ! Fred , he 's fine ! He 's just resting . Thrusters go in three , two ... - Hold on . - ... one . We have liftoff . Fifty meters . One hundred . - Increasing velocity . - 200 meters . Course is good . Nice flying , Uncle walnut . [ Julie ] One thousand . Two thousand . Increasing velocity . Five thousand ... Six thousand ... - Eight thousand . - You 're almost clear of the storm . Ten thousand . - All systems green . - I think we made it . What the heli was that ? - Houston , we 've had an impact ! - It wasn 't me ! [ Bill ] Navigation controls compromised ! Switching to auxiliary power . We 're losing velocity . Status ! ECIsS down , OMS down , visual contact down . - It 's a total kill . - Solutions ! Randall rewires the entire circuitry in less than two minutes . Bud , what do we do here ? We do nothing . Pilgrim is in a freefall . Nav controls are out . I need the engine computers up now ! This time it was definitely not me ! Switching to manual . Randall , check below . Randall , how 's it look down there ? Like this ! [ mimics electricity crackling ] Well , fix it ! Stop this ship from tumbling and give me a week ! You 've got two minutes ! To recap , the Pilgrim was caught in a violent sandstorm and is now tumbling towards Mars . We 're standing by to hear the latest NASA has to say about this terrible incident . 4,500 meters , dropping fast . Ninety seconds to impact . Tell me straight . Can he do it ? Only a complete genius or a total fool could pull this off . Lucky for us he 's both . Any power yet , Bill ? Nothing . We 're in a flat spin . This would be a terrific time to fix that ! Any time now would be good ! 60 seconds to impact . System 's still red . We have audio link . Fred ? Fred , can you hear me ? Bud ... I 'm down below . Everything 's spinning . I don 't know what to do ! Focus . It 's like in training . The rotating chair with the wires . - That was a real winner ! - You can do this . Trust your instincts . Now ! [ Bill ] Fred , come on ! You can do it . [ Julie ] Thirty seconds ! Don 't give up , Fred ! Come on ! Gotta close the circuit . - Come on , Fred . - Fifteen seconds to impact . Need something ... You 're the man ! - Come on . - [ Julie ] Ten seconds ! - Bud 's coin ! - Come on ! Yee-haa ! We got power ! You did it , Fred ! [ Bill ] Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Put on the porch light , Mama ! We 're comin ' home ! Oh , Magoo . You 've done it again , sir ! That little space rock 's gonna make you real famous , Julie Ford . So , what 's next for you , rocketman ? Well , actually , i was thinking about asking you to dance . Oh , well , thanks , but i think we 've done that before . Wait. i had a little time on my hands recently , and I 've been practicing . That , and i got a bit creative with the space blankets .

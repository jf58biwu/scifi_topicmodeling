 You make man ? No . Woman . Woman . THEME MUSIC : Weird science . Pictures from a magazine . Diagrams and charts . Mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . No heart of gold . Just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hands . Why don 't people understand ? It 's alive . Alive ! TED BARGER : The other way ! Get ' em ! I think we lost them . What kind of moron tells Ted Barger his mother has a face like a baboon 's butt ? Relax . I knew we 'd get away with it . Oh , you did ? How ? Did you think some magic genie was going to show up and save us ? Don 't be stupid . I knew we could outrun that brain dead , " Barnie " watcher . Oh . Hey , Ted . I completely understand why you 're a little ticked off . You probably want an apology . Yeah . Gary , apologize to Ted . Sure . Ted , I 'm sorry your mother looks like a baboon 's butt . You 're dead . Hold them while I rip them a new pie hole . Wait ! Isn 't there anything we can do to make this up to you ? Besides giving blood . I 'm a reasonable guy . I think we can negotiate . I tape re-runs of " The Facts of Life . " I tape re-runs of " The Facts of Life . " I sleep on rubber sheets . I sleep on rubber sheets ! I tape re-runs of " The Facts of Life . " I tape re-runs- - I 'll tell you , Wyatt , the only way our lives could suck any more than they do is if- - Our lives couldn 't suck any more than they do . What are you doing ? I 'm writing about our day in my journal . You keep a diary ? Girls keep diaries . Men keep journals . Yeah , right . Hey , let 's try something . I 'll bet you can go back to any day in your diary- - Journal . Yeah . And whatever day you pick , I bet it was miserable . Come on . We 've had some good days . OK , let 's see . March 13th . Very funny , Gary . What ? Gary and I were trapped in the boys ' bathroom . The seniors were pounding at the door . Gary wasn 't going to be able to talk his way out of this one . LISA : Excuse me . Pardon me . It was time to kiss our butts goodbye , when Lisa shows up . You got to help us . SENIOR : We can help you . WYATT DONNELLY : She transformed the stall into an elevator . And using her magic , we rode to the top floor of nowhere and our of harm 's way . I have to admit that , in this case , having our own genie probably saved our lives . When did you write this ? I didn 't write it . Well , I didn 't . You must have . How could I ? I didn 't even know you had a journal until today . Every entry in here mentions our genie , Lisa . [ TYPING ] [ BEEPING ] It says in here that we made her on my computer . There are hundreds of entries in here . What if it were true ? Not that it could be . Could it ? Do you remember having a genie ? I don 't remember having a genie . Think I would remember that . Look at all these entries . Genies only exist in Arabian folk tales and lame sitcoms . I know , but if we did have a genie , where is she ? WOMAN : Stop complaining . You 're my genie now . But I don 't want to be your genie . I want to be Gary and Wyatt 's genie . Besides , I 'd never fit my NordicTrack in that little thing . WOMAN : Shut up and get back in the laptop now . As you wish , master . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Wyatt , this is completely impossible . If this were true , we would have amazing lives . And we don 't . We have sucky lives , remember ? There 's over a year 's worth of entries mentioning Lisa in here . We were rock stars and trolls . I dated a robot and a chimp . I was president of the United States . Who could make all this stuff up ? Are you kidding ? A four year old could make this stuff up . We 'll look for clues in the journal . See when we last had this Lisa and go from there . This is it . The last time Lisa was mentioned . It says here that Phoebe was coming to stay with us . Who 's Phoebe ? Our own private , little , sugar plum fairy ? The daughter of my parents ' best friends . I used to have to hang out with her when I was a little . And I hated her . She was this selfish , little brat . I haven 't seen her since I was about 10 years old . But here , it says she was coming to stay with us just last week . I don 't remember that . Me neither . It also says she 's all grown up and cute with the body like Wilma Flintstone . I couldn 't stop looking at Phoebe . And I couldn 't believe this was the same girl I used to lock out of my tree house . So Wyatt , I can 't get over how grown up you are . You were such a wimpy , little kid . And now you 're such a man . You know , Phoebe , I was kind of a wimpy , little kid myself . I can imagine . So you two grew up together ? That kind of makes you like family . Brother and sister almost . Almost doesn 't count . So what kind of things do you like to do , Phoebe ? Well , I spend most of my time making plans for the future , trying to live up to my potential . College ? I 'm going to be a talk show host . Oh , that 's so great . You would be so great at that . I think those shows are so great . They really help people . Help people ? They rake in the cash . My only wish is to be the queen of trash TV . Are these two perverts holding you against your will , miss ? Chett ! Is that you ? It 's me . Phoebe Hale . Little Phoebe Hale ? Wow . You grew in good places . Last time I saw you , they were shipping you off to military school . Yup . Well , I 'm a graduate now . Buck , Private First Class Donnelly . Really ? My goodness . And I 've got a great , big gun . Wow . That must really help compensate for your little , tiny schmegegge . Harsh . [ CLEARING THROAT ] Oh , hi , Lis . Hi , I 'm Lisa . Phoebe . Lisa 's an old flame . Purely physical . But she started getting clingy and I had to get rid of her . Now she follows me around . She 's obsessed with me . So does that make me more interesting ? She was obsessed with you ? Oh , yes . Gary 's not like other men . You see , I 've always been repulsed by muscles , and straight teeth , and clear skin , and a jaw line . Nuff ' said . And a personality . Does any of this ring a bell ? No . How about you ? Nothing . I don 't get it . There 's more . Listen to this . As usual , Gary 's got a big piece of food between his teeth . Let 's skip over that part . Here we go . The four of us were playing a game of truth or dare . Go ahead , Phoebe . It 's your turn to pick . Wyatt , truth or dare ? Dare . This will be a table dare . I dare everyone to dine and dash . What ? She wants us to run out on the check . It doesn 't sound like a very good idea to me . Me neither . What if we get caught ? Well , you don 't have to do it , if you 're afraid . I 'm not afraid . That 's not it . I 'll do it . You will ? I mean , we will . We do it all the time . Why , if I had a nickel for every time we dined and dashed . It 's just a dumb game . It 's not worth getting in trouble . There 's no risk , there 's no fun . You guys ready ? Let 's go . Be cool . Hey ! Ah ! Call the police . These kids are trying to rip me off . [ LIQUID POURING ] Oh , thanks , Lis . Yeah . I 'm too pretty for prison . My pleasure . What is going on here ? What has happened to everybody ? And that 's it . That 's the last entry that mentions Lisa . Exactly one week ago . Isn 't that amazing ? It 's amazing that you write down every word that everybody says in your journal . Hey , Chett , can I talk to you for a minute ? What 's it worth to you ? My time is very valuable . It 's going to cost you . One question . I 'll give you a buck . You 're in for $ 5 already . Meter 's running . $ 6 , $ 6.50 , $ 6.75- - All right . All right . Have you seen Phoebe Hale lately ? I 'm going to have to think about that one . Hm . Cha-ching . Huh ? Cha-ching . Oh . Ka-ching , ka-ching , ka-ching- - Chett ! Before I answer , your total comes to $ 18.50 plus tip . Payment in advance . Yeah . I 've seen Phoebe Hale . Every day at 3 : 00 o 'clock , you moron . Aw ! Hope that doesn 't spoil your dinner , sis . Thanks , Chett . It 's Phoebe . Controversy has a new name- - Phoebe . Watch my show . You won 't believe your eyes . ANNOUNCER : The Phoebe Hale Show . Weekdays at 3 : 00 . Last week , she was a high school delinquent . This week , she has her own talk show . What do you have to say now ? I say , she stole our genie . I 'm not famous enough . Phoebe , I gave you TV 's highest rated talk show . You beat Oprah . Still . I know what I want . I want to win an award . Phoebe , did you hear ? You just won The American Kennel Club 's Best of Breed . You have to be specific . Oh , all right . Uh- - you just swept the Emmys . The press wants a statement . After the show . You see , the awards are nice , but the show 's the thing . I do what I do for my fans . OK now . I want Ricki Lake 's show canceled , a date with Steven Tyler , a body like Madonna , and please , don 't mess it up like last time . I don 't want to a body like Steven Tyler and a date with Madonna . You got all that ? Yes , ma 'am . Good . Now I 've got a few more hours for you to run after the show , so don 't wander off . Yes , ma 'am . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Oh , man . I 'd kill to turn that girl into a potato bug . Oh , excuse me . We want to see Phoebe ? Oh , I 'm afraid that 's impossible . Nobody sees Phoebe before show time . But if you let me see your tickets , I 'll be happy to show you to your seats . We 're not here to see the show . Oh . Oh , I see . You must be guests . Yes . We are . Feel free to use anything you want inside to disguise yourselves . And I just want to say , I think this is incredibly brave of you guys to appear in public like this . Thanks . She must think we 're mobsters or something . I guess so . I want to talk to you . Oh , the genie has a problem . You miss Wyatt ? Or do you miss Gary ? Or is it both ? I don 't like the way you 're abusing my power . Me ? Abuse power ? It 's not in my nature . How many times do I have to tell you ? Two Equals . Two ! I 've seen Pauly Shore movies smarter than you . I had that coming . So are we really going to be on the show ? What 's the plan ? I 'm not sure yet . Just put on your disguise and get ready . I 'm not famous enough . I 'm not pretty enough . Get me a date , get me an Emmy . My head 's sweating . Oh , don 't look now , but we are in the presence of the perfect woman . She 's unbelievable . Guys ! I can 't believe it . You 're here ! I thought I 'd never see you again . I missed you both so much . How did you find me ? How did you know I was here ? Who are you ? It 's me . Lisa . I 'm a believer , Wyatt . If I was going to create a woman , it 'd be this one . What- - what happened ? Why don 't we remember you ? Yeah . Why 'd you leave us ? And can I have another hug ? When Phoebe found out about me at The Java Man , you guys decided to trust her with the whole story . Big mistake . [ FILM ROLLING ] The next day , when you guys went to school , Phoebe accessed my file on your computer . She reprogrammed me to be in her control . [ RAYS FLASHING ] I wish I had a diamond necklace . Get it for me . [ RAYS FLASHING ] LISA : I should have choked her with it . Now Gary and Wyatt told me that you can erase people 's memories . Is that right ? Yes . OK then . I command you to erase Gary and Wyatt 's memories of you and of everything you ever did together . I don 't want him to know that you even existed . Understand ? But why ? Because you 're mine now . And they can 't miss what they never knew they had . LISA : Then she took me out of your computer and that was it . Like I never existed . [ FILM ROLLING ] - Whoa . Unbelievable . Once the spell was in place , you guys couldn 't remember anything . But I did . I remembered all the wonderful times we had together . But I was helpless to do anything about it . So I guess if it wasn 't for Wyatt 's diary- - ( TOGETHER ) Journal . Whatever . If it wasn 't for that , you would have never known what happened . You said you could erase people 's memories , right ? Well , maybe you could erase Phoebe 's memory and the three of us could go home . I can 't . I 'm not allowed honor anyone 's request , but hers . I can 't help you do anything that would go against Phoebe 's wishes . What does that mean ? You 're on your own . It 's just like when we were kids and she stole my He-Man belt buckle . She hasn 't changed a bit . What are we going to do ? She 's not going to get away with it this time . Get ready for the show . [ APPLAUSE ] ANNOUNCER : Is everybody ready to meet America 's favorite talk show host ? [ CHEERING ] ANNOUNCER : Well , let 's bring her out ! Here 's Phoebe ! AUDIENCE : Phoebe ! Phoebe ! Phoebe ! Phoebe ! Phoebe ! What a group ! Hey , everybody . Today 's show should be very interesting . Let 's bring out our guests . [ APPLAUSE ] Welcome . These five people all have something in common . Can you guess their secrets ? AUDIENCE : ( TOGETHER ) Men who became women who became men again ! Sit down ! This is the worst thing you 've ever done to me . I didn 't know . Come on , you have to stay . You want to get Lisa back , don 't you ? Let 's start with the gentleman in the center . As you can see , he is in disguise to protect his identity . What can you tell us about your very peculiar urges ? Phoebe , we 're here to get something out in the open . And we think it 's mighty brave of you , don 't we , audience ? [ CHEERING ] For your information , Phoebe . I write down everything in my journal . And I bet that helps . Believe me , I know . Sometimes a diary can be a girl 's- - or a guys best friend . [ LAUGHTER ] Let me understand this . You were a man , then you were a woman , now you 're a man again ? You need a hobby . [ LAUGHTER ] Maybe we can hear from our next guest about what was so terrible about being a woman that would make you want to change back . My guess is it was hard for that guy cause he didn 't look so hot in a dress . But listen , fella , I think you 'd look terrific in a nice tube top . [ CHEERING ] OK . That 's it . I 'm a man . I 've always been a man . And I wouldn 't be caught dead in a tube top . We 're here because Phoebe stole something that belongs to us . Wyatt and I created a woman on our computer who is capable of magic . And when Phoebe found out about it , she stole her from us and forced her to erase our memory . How do you think she got this talk show ? You think they just give these out to people ? We want our genie back . A genie . Oh , that explains a lot . A genie ? A genie ? Where 'd Gary get the money for his sex change operation ? I had a genie once that was stolen by my dog of an ex-husband . My advice to you , don 't dwell . Hey , if anybody ever stole my genie , I 'd get her back instead of running around having operations . Oh ! That 's a terrible thing to say ! Hey , don 't touch me ! That man lost his genie ! [ JEERING ] Gary , Wyatt , what a surprise that was . I 'll bet . You probably thought you 'd get away with this . Well , you can 't blame a girl for trying . I mean , who wouldn 't want a magic genie . We trusted you . I know . I- - I feel just awful really . And I have to say , I don 't think Lisa 's been nearly as happy with me as she was with you . Can you ever forgive me ? You mean , you 're going to let us take Lisa home . Just like that . Well , kind of rat do you think I am ? Lisa ? Yes . Do me a favor , clean out these boys ' memories again . And this time , do it right . Wait . Ugh , Lisa , do something . [ SCREAMING ] Now erase their memories . The commercial 's almost over . OK . If that 's what you want . What ? Why do you say it like that ? What else should I do ? Oh , nothing . You 're the boss . If that 's what you want me to do , I am but your humble servant . Look , I command you to tell me what 's on your mind . Well , OK . I was just thinking . You see how clever these boys are . I mean , they found us this time . Who 's to say they wouldn 't find us again ? So ? So maybe instead of no memory of this , you should wish that you never met . Well , if they never met me , they never know I have their genie . Sorry , guys . She made me tell her . I wish I never knew you . [ RAYS FLASHING ] Oh , no . Bye , bye . [ RAYS FLASHING ] - Lisa , you 're here . - Yup . Miss me ? What happened ? Well , Phoebe wished that she never knew you . So if she never knew you , then she never could have stolen me . You 're brilliant . Well . Not only that , I remember everything else , too . Like the time you give us the remote to stop time and nearly got us killed . And once , when you suped to my computer and nearly got us killed . Then there was the time you brought our video game to life and nearly got us killed . And the time I went all the way with Melinda Rossi . I threw in a couple of bonus memories . Hm . Why do people go on these shows ? I don 't know . 15 minutes of fame , 100 bucks , and free bagels . But you know , the best thing is , she 's not just our genie . She 's also our friend . And did I mention , she zaps up a mean milkshake ? [ LAUGHTER ] THEME SONG : Weird . Weird . Oh . Weird science . Plastic tubes , and pots , and pains . Bits , and pieces , and magic from the hand . We 're making weird science . Oh . Things I 've never seen before . Behind bolted doors , talent and imagination . Weird science . Plastic tubes , and pots , and pans . Bits and pieces . Bits and pieces , pieces , pieces . My creation . Is it real ? It 's my creation . Oh , my creation . My creation . It 's my creation . From my heart and from my hands . Why don 't people understand my intentions ?

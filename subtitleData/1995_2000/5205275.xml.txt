 MAGGIE : I don 't have a problem with two men dancing together . Yeah , me neither . If the guy asked me , I would ... I 'm confused . Those were men ? That 's right . But they were dressed in womers clothing . Some guys just like to dress up like women . I mean , it 's ... Well , they sort of ... Well , it 's a lifestyle thing . ( STUTTERING ) Yeah . It makes them feel pretty . They were pretty . Keep sliding with us , I guarantee you 'll see a lot stranger things . Don 't you ever get tired of it ? I mean , one dangerous place after another ? Don 't you ever just wanna find a nice place and just stay ? MAN : Hey ! QUINN : All the time ... What is this ? New York World ? Are you nuts ? Get off the street , it 's gonna rain ! Looks like we 're in for a little sprinkle . ( RUMBLING ) WOMAN : Come on , you guys , hurry up . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) WOMAN : Just get in the car ! Kids , hurry up ! I 've never seen folks so skittish about a little rain before . Well , maybe this is Killer Lightning World . ( CHUCKLES ) Flash flood ... ( ALL EXCLAIMING ) It stings like lye ! ( MAGGIE SCREAMING ) Acid Rain World ! If we don 't get inside pronto , there 's gonna be nothing left but bones . Actually , even a moderately strong acid rain would easily dissolve human bone , I 've heard . ( SCREAMING ) ( ALL SCREAMING ) Did anyone catch the weather report today ? Yeah , sure . Sulfuric thunderstorms tapering off to a light hydrochloric sprinkle in the afternoon . ( GASPING ) You should have worn your rubbers . Oh , my gosh ! Are you folks all right ? Didrt you hear the weather report ? Oh , I 'm sorry , we must 've missed it . Oh , well , you must be from out of town . We 're from Canada . ( WOMAN EXCLAIMING ) Well , we never go out without checking the weather first . Especially during the rainy season . ( EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST ) Welcome to the Chandler Hotel . We 're freeway close to all the major theme parks , we accept travel club discounts and , lucky for you , we just happen to have a few vacancies . So let me get your bags . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Excuse me . Excuse me . Where are you going ? What 's wrong ? Anywhere but here , out of my way . You need more towels . Please , don 't go . It 's raining outside ! I 'd rather be staked out in a typhoon in my birthday suit than spend another second in this madhouse ! So , how about a suite ? ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) Room rates . QUINN . : What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ETHEREAL VOICE . : Sliders . ( WOMAN WHISTLING ) This is the presidential suite . The president stayed here ? Well , I can 't be sure , but it did look like him . Why were those people leaving ? People ? In the lobby . ( SCOFFS ) Well , you see , the Chandler is a very unique vacation experience . Not everyone can handle so much pampering and relaxation . All those people ran out into an acid rainstorm because the room service is just too good ? ( LAUGHING NERVOUSLY ) You ... Anyway , we have all the major amenities . Rain slickers embroidered with the distinctive Chandler logo , decontamination shower stalls , emergency eye wash , and complimentary assortment of burn ointments . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Well , if you need anything else at all , feel free to just call the front desk . Thank you . And that is for you . Thank you , sir . That woman should seriously consider decaf . Well , at least we have a roof over our heads until we slide . Which is in 12 hours . REMBRANDT : Just make sure we leave a wake-up call . Well , it 's too early to crash . I 'm gonna head down to the bar . Anybody want to join me ? Yeah . Why not ? You wanna come , bro ? Yo , farm boy , you wanna chill with us at the bar ? No . I 'm quite happy with the temperature up here . Thanks . No , no , no . " Chill " means to just hang out . You know , be mellow . Oh , I see . No , I think I 'll just crash . You know , see what programs are being transmitted tonight . ( GUNS FIRING ON TV ) Check out the Spice Channel . WOMAN 1 . : Next week on the Spice Channel ... There 's a channel on spices . You can call me when it 's hot , fast and fresh . Interesting . MAN . : ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Pizza man . WOMAN 2 . : Mmm . I 'm so hungry . Hey , I ordered this with sausage . Extra toppings , huh ? I can handle that . ( MAN UNZIPPING ) WOMAN 1 . : Pizza Man , next week on the Spice Channel . Remember , he 'll take 30 minutes or it 's free . ( GUNS FIRING ) Did I do the right thing , dragging Colin along with us ? He 's your brother . Your folks wanted you both to be together . I don 't even know him . You didn 't know me . You didn 't know Remmy . ( SIGHING ) I know . Hey , if you guys ever want to call it quits . I mean , if you find a nice , peaceful world and you want to settle down , it 's okay with me . It won 't be home , but we 've been to a few that were close enough . I just wanted you guys to know that . ( FAKE SNIFFLING ) Are you saying that you don 't want us to meet your parents ? ( CHUCKLING ) So , can I get you folks anything ? I will have a draft . Make it two . I 'm feeling original . Make mine the same . Three drafts coming up . So , some weather we 're having , huh ? Yeah . You think it 's gonna ever clear up ? Oh , maybe . Ever since they shut down those offshore refineries , the air 's gotten a whole lot better . Hey , were you guys around back in ' 93 when Santa Monica Bay caught fire ? It 's this dang El Ni√±o . Pushes in those petrochemicals right in off the ocean . ( EXCLAIMING ) Oh , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Did you guys want oysters in those ? ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( THUNDER CLAPPING ) ... alive ! It 's alive ! Henry , in the name of God ! FRANKENSTEIN . # # In the name of God ! Now I know what it ... ( WHOOSHING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Hello . What are you doing here ? ( WHOOSHING ) Hey ? Hey , where are you going ? Who are you ? Hey , wait . Wait . It 's okay . I won 't hurt you . ( INAUDIBLE ) I don 't understand . Whoa . Seems a little slow tonight , huh ? Hey , stick around till Wednesday . Karaoke . Hey , you get tired of all those infomercials ? You will not believe what I just saw . Man , I told you that spray-on hair doesn 't work . There was someone in our room . MAGGIE : What ? What are you talking about ? A boy . Only he wasrt really there . He appeared . He grabbed the TV thingy and walked through a closed door like some kind of ... Of ... Non-corporeal shade . Are you saying you saw a ghost ? Colin , what were you watching on TV ? A program about this medical pioneer . He created a living creature by stitching together parts of corpses . Amazing . Though in the end , I gather it got a little out of hand . Sounds like Frankenstein . That 's him . MAGGIE : Okay , Colin . You were really wiped , maybe you just fell asleep in front of the TV . ( SCOFFING ) You think I dreamed this ? Hey , man , you 've been traveling a lot . You 're tired . We better get him a drink , and make it a stiff one . ( REMBRANDT CHUCKLES ) Is that what all you people think of me ? That I 'm some backwards rube who 's afraid of evil spirits ? We may burn the occasional witch where I come from , but I 'm a man of science . Same as you , brother . And I know what I saw . ( THUNDER CLAPPING ) Welcome to the Chandler Hotel . We 're freeway close to all the major theme parks ... I have a few more trunks in the cab . I 'll take care of them . Right this way , sir . This is the second weirdest hotel I 've ever stayed in . Colin , I just want you to consider that there might be some other explanation for this . Like I 'm a ignorant , superstitious bumpkin . No . I was thinking more that you 're tired . You fall asleep watching an old horror movie , and ... ( IMITATING SPOOKY MUSIC ) Do you think this is easy for me ? I spent my whole life trying to adjust to my own world , and now I 've got a million more to deal with . I 've got a lot of catching up to do , and it doesn 't help if you accuse me of acting like a fool . Nobody 's acting like a fool . ( HUMMING ) ( MACHINE BEEPS ) ( BUZZING ) ( HUMMING ) ( FINGER RUBBING ON GLASS ) ( GASPING ) Quinn ! There was something invisible with me inside the bathroom ... There is a head in the ice machine and it had my face . ... and it wrote , " Help us , " on the mirror . This place is haunted . MAGGIE : Come on . Let 's go . Come on , Colin . I swear . I 'm not kidding you . There was a head in the ice machine . In there . It looked like you ? Well , it was blue and frosty , but yeah . ( ICE MACHINE DOOR SLIDING OPEN ) Well ? Have a look . ( CLOSING DOOR ) Okay . There was a head in there and it looked just like me . Well , since yours seems to be firmly attached , I really would not sweat it . All right . Don 't you blow me off . I know a disembodied head when I see one . I believe you . I know I believe her . And another thing , I didn 't have a nightmare while I was shaving . No , but somebody could have written that anytime . When the mirror steamed up , those words just became visible again . There is nothing going on here that cannot be explained by a bunch of tired people stuck in an old hotel with a Boris Karloff marathon on cable . Now , why don 't we get some rest ? We 've got an early slide in the morning . What time should we be ready ? In about 10 ... Hours . Where 's the timer ? It was right there . Nobody moved it ? That boy was in here . Now , what would a ghost want with a timer ? That weird guy from the lobby was snooping around outside . Fine . You check him out . I 'm gonna go talk to our host . Put some clothes on . " Put some clothes on . " Hello ? Hello ? ( BOTH SCREAMING ) Don 't you ever sleep ? The hotel never sleeps , sir . How may I help you ? We 've lost something . Oh , well , then let 's look in the lost and found . Ah , it was actually taken from our room . Has anyone been in there ? A maid ? Oh , no , no . I make up the rooms myself , and I haven 't been in there since you checked in . ( SIGHING ) Well , then maybe you can help us find it . Oh , I 'm sorry . I can 't leave the desk . But I thought this was a full-service hotel ? Well ... My sworn duty as concierge does obligate me to help my guests in any way possible . I promise you , there will be a big tip in it for you . Well , please , sir , the satisfaction of my guests is reward enough . ( ELECTRONICS BEEPING ) Yeah ? Can we talk to you for a second ? I 'm busy . We saw you snooping around our room . What are you looking for ? Leave me alone . What do you got in there ? Amazing . You guys can 't just bust in here ! I see you 're into electronics . You wouldn 't happen to have seen a small electronic device lying around , would you ? About yea big , red , blinking numbers ? What would I be doing in your room ? Come on . Don 't touch that . Why don 't you tell us that ? What 's all the gear for ? I 'm doing meteorological experiments . Analyzing weather patterns and atmospheric contamination . You study the weather by sucking up dust bunnies ? I was collecting water and particulate samples off of people 's shoes . They tracked into the hotel . If that 's even any of your business . What 's your name ? Smith . John Smith . You expect us to believe that ? What kind of an idiot checks into a hotel using the alias of " John Smith " ? I realize it is not a very common name , you know , but that is no reason for you to be insulting . Well , he 's not lying . John Smith . Graduate student at Caltec . My mother named me after the Greek god of intellectual pursuits and lost objects . ( BEEPING ) What does this thing do ? ( BEEPING FASTER ) MAGGIE : Come on , guys . We should let Mr. Smith get back to work . Sorry we disturbed you . I think we should keep an eye on our Mr. Smith . We haven 't seen anyone else come or go since the rain started . Yeah . Then the timer 's probably in the building somewhere . We 've got nine hours to turn this place upside down . Have you guys ever lost the timer before ? So , " to chill " is a good thing ? Oh , yeah , man . If you chill , that means you 're cool . Obviously if you were chilled , that means you 'd be cold . Well , see , it 's not about temperature . It 's about a state of mind . So , cool is good . So , if you 're too hot , that must be bad , right ? Well , both hot and bad are good . I 'm not even gonna get into " phat " , " fresh " and " dope " . ( SIGHS ) Oh , great . What is this , a bad horror movie ? ( SIGHING ) What 's next ? Blood pouring out of the elevator , voodoo dolls chasing us with steak knives ? Oh , there 's a flashlight back here in every other world . Got you . Ow ! Yeah , that 's gonna leave a mark . ( SIGHING ) ( ETHEREAL NOISE ) Who 's there ? Quinn ? Is that you ? Quinn ? Hello ? Sorry . This usually happens after the first storm . The rain eats right through the wires . How long have you been working here ? Oh , my husband and I bought the place six years ago . We always wanted to run our own hotel . He died two months after we opened the doors . I 'm sorry . ( SHRUGS ) It was cancer . He worked for SoCal Oil and Gas , digging the San Fernando petro duct . We bought this place to get him out of that hole . ( CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ) I guess we waited a little too long . Do you ever think about leaving ? Going someplace where there aren 't so many ghosts ? Um ... ( STUTTERING ) I still have a lot invested in this place . Oh , hey , I 've got it . Thanks . It 's nice having people stay at the hotel again . I spend a lot of time in hotels . It isn 't easy having people just pass through your life . No point in getting attached though when checkout time is at 12 : 00 , right ? We ... We better keep looking . Anyone down here ? ( RATS SQUEAKING ) Quinn , if that 's you , I swear I 'm gonna skin you alive . ( DOOR SLAMMING ) Hey ! Hey , who 's out there ? Let me out of here ! Oh , man . This is the room the boy went into . I don 't care what your brother said . There is something paranormal going on here . " Paranormal . " Beyond normal . Yeah . Yeah , that sums things up nicely . There 's definitely something paranormal going on around here . I 'm gonna run down to the front desk , see if I can hustle up a key to this door . Good idea . Rembrandt . Remmy . Don 't be afraid . My name 's Colin Mallory . What 's yours ? ( INAUDIBLE ) I can 't hear you . What are you trying to tell me ? Where did you come from ? Remmy . Remmy ? Paranormal . ( BEEPING ) ( BEEPING FASTER ) REMBRANDT : Colin , I didn 't get us a key , but I got us some light . Rembrandt , I saw the boy again . He opened the door . Hey , Colin ? I 'm right here . What 's the matter with you ? I 'm right here ! Colin ! BOY : Hi . He couldn 't see me . They can 't . I can hear you . I can touch you . Sure . You 're on my side now . Your side . Am I ... Are we dead ? I don 't know . It 's pretty boring , whatever it is . My name 's Matthew . I 'm Colin . I know . You 're the first person who could see me , so I brought you on over . We can hang out now . Hang out . Sure . Play and stuff . The others are mean . I don 't go near them anymore . The others ? ( RATS SQUEAKING ) Okay , rats , keep your distance because I am not having a good day . ( YELPS ) ( DOOR LATCH OPENING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) Hey ! Maggie , it 's me . What took you so long ? Didrt you hear me yelling ? What happened ? I thought I saw someone . I followed them down here and then I got locked in . ( STUTTERING ) And I could hear things . Like little animals , with little claws and little beady yellow eyes scurrying at my feet . Easy , girl . I thought you were a Marine . I don 't like rats . Come on . We go out this way . ( SIGHING ) Jeez . Any luck ? Maggie saw someone run into the cellar . Smith ? Maybe . I couldn 't tell . Where 's Colin ? I lost him . I came down to find a key to room 315 . When I went back upstairs , he was gone . Look , 315 is the only room that doesn 't have a spare key behind the desk . Now , I thought you said that Smith was the only other person that was staying here ? He is . Well , then where 's that key ? I don 't know . I don 't understand it . Things are always getting lost in this place . Yeah , you 're telling us . Listen , lady , somebody stole our property , put a human head in the ice machine , locked me in a rat-infested cellar , and I don 't like rats , so don 't tell me this is all part of our unique vacation experience . ( SIGHING ) Sorry . What 's going on here ? It 's okay . You can tell us . Okay . It 's not really the off-season . Oh , well , actually every day around here is the off-season . The hotel is haunted . ( LAUGHING ) Come on . What 's really going on ? ( CREEPY ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING ) It 's haunted . You know , " Boo . " Bumps in the night . Blood-curdling screams . The whole ball of wax . Disembodied heads in the ice chest don 't exactly make for five-star ratings . I told you . So , why stay ? I mean , why not just pack up and go ? I can 't . MAGGIE : Why not ? I have a son . Matthew . He 's ... He 's 10 . After my husband died , he 's all I had . All right , well ... What happened ? This is the last place I saw Matthew . That 's why I can 't leave . This thing just appeared here two years ago . HOLLY : I don 't know what it is . I 've talked to police , scientists , psychics . The Air Force took over the hotel for almost a year , until even they got bored . I 'm supposed to call them if anything happens . Our window wasrt scheduled to open for four more hours . It 's not ours . You know what that is ? It 's a portal to an alternate world . ( MACHINE BEEPING ) It must be stuck open somehow . REMBRANDT : You think Colin must have gone in ? Quinn . ( DOOR OPENS ) So much for the " Do not disturb " sign . Where 's my brother ? What are you talking about ? What 's the forecast , Willard ? You always predict the weather with an EM scanner ? That is for lightning and atmospheric discharges . What are you doing here and what do you know about my son ? I can 't stop her . Okay , okay . All right , you wanna know the truth ? I hunt ghosts . Ghosts . Yeah . I have a theory . That phenomena that are often attributed to the supernatural are actually a result of fluctuations in space-time . And what people see as ghosts ... No , no . They are actually visitors from alternate quantum realities . That 's a pretty good theory . And I believe that , that disturbance in room 315 ... I believe that , that is a doorway into such an alternate reality . I was trying to get some readings when I saw your friend fall in . And you didn 't tell us ? I was getting around to it . All right . Here 's the deal . We 'll help you prove your theory , but you gotta help us first . SMITH : I was working on these portable nuclear power cells . Eventually , they cut off my funding at Caltec . They wouldn 't let me use the fusion reactor anymore . Jerks . Oh , I put most of these detectors together in my garage . You built a nuclear reactor in your garage ? A little one . ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) Okay . All systems look nominal . How about a condensed version for the scientifically impaired ? Each alternate Earth has its own quantum signature . We should be able to adjust the equipment to amplify the quantum signal from that vortex upstairs . What will that do ? ( WHOOSHING ) Hey , bro . Look who I met . It worked ! Matthew . Mom ! QUINN : They 're not really here . The equipment is just making them visible to us . That is quite correct . You seem a bit more sagacious than our own Mr. Mallory . Sod off , you brainy twit . Allow me to introduce my traveling companions . This is Quinn " Howling Man " Mallory , a singer of some sort I 'm told . ( SINGING ) Get us the hell out of here REMBRANDT 2 : And this is Miss Maggie Beckett , exotic dancer . Hi . Are you responsible for opening the vortex upstairs ? REMBRANDT 2 : Yes , I was working on an antigravity machine when something went a bit awry . The resulting quantum disturbance sucked us into this ephemeral state . This is fantastic . You 've been here this whole time ? I knew about the disturbances , but I never ... You 're people . ( SCOFFS ) We 've been trying to find someone to help us for like two years . You ... You 're a stripper ? No , love . Exotic dancer . Unfortunately , our attempts to communicate were widely misconstrued as some kind of horror show . Yeah . Real horrorshow . How 'd you like the cellar , baby ? You make any friends ? ( IMITATING RAT SQUEAKING ) Anyway , Colin here was the only person that could actually see us . Colin , you and Matthew must have nearly the same quantum signature . That 's why only you could see him . My thoughts precisely . Sorry I didn 't believe you , bro . Never close your mind to the possibilities , brother . I 've missed you so much . I know . I could see you the whole time . I tried to tell you I was okay , but you couldn 't hear me . Look at you . You haven 't changed at all . Don 't cry . Colin said his brother can get us out of here . Yeah . Well , he bloody well better , because we 've got your little timer , see ? And brainiac over here says that when these numbers run down , if you don 't have it back , you 're gonna be right up it . Yeah , baby . Sorry . Who knew he was paying attention ? What 's happening ? SMITH : The quantum frequency is oscillating . Colirs extra mass must be destabilizing the vortex . Matthew ! No , we 're losing them . No , I don 't have enough power . COLIN . : Power the vortex . Frankenstein ! REMBRANDT : Where are they ? They 're here . They 're stuck in a transient state between this world and theirs . Yeah , but not for long . Aw , jeez , the instability is increasing . Look , an hour , maybe less , you know , we ... This whole entire vortex could collapse completely . What does that mean ? If the exotic matter holding the vortex open collapses , they 'll be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the wormhole . My sors still alive in there . You have to get him out . My brother 's in there , too , Holly . Believe me , we 'll do what we can . SMITH : We need more data . I have to get closer to the vortex to get some neutrino flux readings . ( WHOOSHING ) REMBRANDT : Whoa . That shouldn 't be a problem . Oh , my God . I thought you said the vortex was collapsing . No , I ... I said it was unstable . He said it was collapsing . What 's happening ? I think it 's generating more power to compensate for Colirs extra mass . You better do something before it eats the hotel . MAGGIE : Before it eats the whole planet . If we can tune your detector to the same quantum frequency as the vortex , maybe we can stabilize it . You want to stop that , with this ? This thing runs on four AA batteries . Hey , man , it 's a solid theory . We just need more power . Blackouts like this last for days . Colin was trying to tell us something about power . He said , " Frankenstein . " That doesn 't make any sense . Frankenstein ... Frankenstein ... Frankenstein ! ( GRUNTING ) REMBRANDT : Man , that rain stinks ! The cable 's hooked up . REMBRANDT : Okay . One good lightning bolt and you 're cooking . Thank you , Igor . This won 't work . Sure it will . I 've adjusted your EM detector to emit a pulse to match their quantum signatures . Jeez , how could you possibly know that , that 's the right frequency ? Maggie told me . What ? Yeah . When you saw your double in the ice machine . The cold temperature must have slowed her molecular activity enough for her to materialize . So , now I 've adjusted the molecular resonance to simulate freezing temperatures . One jolt should be enough to reopen the vortex and knock them all loose . But you do not know that . God , you could destroy the vortex completely . What choice do we have ? Listen to me . You cannot let him do this . I mean , if his calibrations are the tiniest bit off , he will crush your son into neutrons . All right . I 'm not gonna kid you . There is a risk involved . But if we don 't do something now ... Well , you may not get another chance . Holly , it 's your call . I trust you . No ! I won 't let you ! Look , they pulled my funding . They pulled my academic credentials . Look , my career is down the toilet . But this ... This proves that I was right . You know , and who do you think Caltec 's gonna call to study this thing , huh ? Me . I laid the groundwork , you know . I put in the hours . That 's my tenure . ( SCREAMING ) He 's still breathing . Okay . What now ? It 's still set to the right frequency . But there 's no power . Not out here . Are you crazy ? Don 't worry . I 'll be right back . Quinn ! Hey , brother . You better watch where you step next time ! That 's the portal . It goes to your world ! Go ! Go ! Thank you , sir . Good luck . Bye , sweetie . Sorry , we didn 't have more time , if you know what I mean . Yeah , baby . Hold on , buddy . What 's happening ? Quinn ! Oh , God , no ! I told you we 'd be right back . Matthew ! ( EXCLAIMS ) Mom , not in front of everybody . ( GROANING ) ( SIGHING ) Where is it ? Oh , no . Sorry , Professor . Looks like it 's back to the drawing board . Maybe not . All the vortex data should be stored right in there . Oh . Oh , my . ( CHUCKLING ) That 'll keep them talking back at Caltec . Thank you . We had a little help from across the astral plane . I 'm bad . Thank you all . I ... Obviously all your rooms will be comped for as long as you 'd like to stay . We appreciate that , ma 'am . But we 've got a lot of traveling to do . Yes . But you did promise a unique vacation experience . Tell all your friends . Listen . What ? It stopped raining .

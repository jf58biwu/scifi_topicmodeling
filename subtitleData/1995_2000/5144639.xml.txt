 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . Ahhh , isn 't this great ? Look at us . An earth family sitting around together on a beautiful autumn evening , playing a nice , friendly game . Yeah , a game called " sex or consequences . " " The naughty , bawdy adult party game where everybody wants to be on top ! " Whoopee . Oh , come on , Sally . You 're not even trying . Look how far you are from " the erogenous zone . " Fine . Ok . " Lover or loser . " That should be fun . " With what celebrity would you be tempted to cheat on your mate ? " Jon voight ! Man , let her answer . Say " Jon voight . " I don 't have a mate to cheat on , Ok ? Uh-uh . That sends you right back to " chastity corner . " I 'm done . Tommy , will you please move her little metal buttocks back 5 spaces ? Uh , excuse me . Sally is the tongue . I am the buttocks . You think she 's Ok ? Sally ? Sure . She just gets this way sometimes since her painful breakup with Don . Ha ! Which one ? Well , I hear that . Tommy , your spin . 1 , 2 , 3 ... " swap partners and smooch " ? Ooh . Sexy ! Hey ! No , no , no ! Dick , why don 't you go play this with Dr. Albright ? Ok ? Oh , fine . But that 's the last time I bring home a sexually explicit board game for this family ! I hate that game . You want to play strip Parcheesi ? You 're on ! Oh , good morning , Dick . Strudwick . [ Slurps ] Must you slurp ? Sorry . It 's a rich , delicious cappuccino . I just made it . So you have a cappuccino machine . It 's a gift from the chancellor just to acknowledge the success of my book . Yes . Your little pamphlet on physics . It 's going into its third printing . Yep . It 's quite a machine . It 's got an auto-frother . Oh , well , I prefer to froth manually . Would you like me to make you a little Cappy , Dick ? Oh , no , thank you , Strudwick . I find that excessive caffeine tends to make one look puffy . Like a jerk . Ok . We got one pastrami lasorda ... mm-mmm . And one mozzarella Fitzgerald . I don 't get the names of these sandwiches . Tommy , here 's your hammy connick Jr . Well , that one 's obvious . Look , it 's piled high with ham and connick . Yeah . [ Motorcycle engine shuts off ] Don ! Nice motorcycle , man ! Shiny ! Sally . Been a while . That is the most incredible machine I 've ever seen . You 're looking at Rutherford P.D. ' s one and only hog . I 've been waiting 5 years to get my- - get back on it . Excuse me ? Get back on it . Oh , yeah . Can I buy you a wrap ? Ok . Uhh ... uhh ... unbelievable . Every hot mama in this place was checking him out . What 's the deal ? Must be the machine . Hot mamas love the machine . Why ? Why do the hot mamas care ? I don 't know . But I 'll tell you something , me little buddy , I 'm gonna find out . Hey ! [ Slurring ] 4 , 5 , 6 . Straight to martini island ! All right ! Would you like me to shake it ? Oh , please . Mmmmm ... mmm ! Ha ha . This beats the scrap out of crabble . Ahh , " naughty or nice . " " What 's the craziest thing you 've ever done in bed ? " Well ... there was the time I staged a reading of " Othello , " and the role of Desdemona was played by a down comforter . I 'm not going to give you any spaces for that . " Truth or dare . " " Who was your last fling ? " Oh ... that would have to be ... [ Both laugh ] Vincent Strudwick . Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha ! Strudwick ! No ! Yes ! I 'm back on martini island ! You can set me up . You can kiss my tiny pewter ass ! Oh , I can 't get his face out of my mind ! Strudwick 's ? No , Nina . Little Davey tennant , the boy down the block . You see , ever since he was 3 years old , Davey 's wanted more than anything to see a real professional baseball game . He wished the biggest wish his little heart could muster . But his dad was laid off and couldn 't afford the tickets . Well ... one day last week , little Davey was outside playing ball like he always does , and who should walk up the block , tall as a building , but home run king mark mcgwire . To see little Davey 's eyes light up as McGWIRE handed him 4 seats on the first base line , well , it 's something that I will never forget . Yes , Strudwick 's face ! Stop asking such stupid questions ! Look , you knew about her past . Yeah , but until last night , her past was--was faceless ! Now it 's got a face . The fuzzy , smirking face of Vincent W. Strudwick . I am so hung over . Ohh . Well , Mary , that 's just nature 's way of telling you what a tramp you are . What ? Mary , did you fill out your form 8-As for your graduate-Level courses ? I didn 't think we needed those until next semester . Strudwick : the bursar 's office says we need them before midterms . Oh , I 'd better get on that . Do you have any blank ones ? Fresh out , but they 've got them at the administration building . Oh , I 'll call Helen . Oh , why don 't you two just get a room ? ! I 'll bring some by later . What is your problem ? Oh , my problem ? So it 's my problem that you had an affair with Strudwick . Nina , how could you tell him ? ! You told him . Oh , I told- - oh , I told him . Oh , Dick , you 've got to understand . Vincent and Dottie were separated . It was 7 years ago . I didn 't even know you then . It 's ancient history ! Oh , ancient history ? Ancient history is dead people- - pyramids , gladiators smiting lions , a bottle of milk for a nickel . This is not ancient history ! Oh , my god . I can still smell him on you ! Hey , I read this crazy statistic in the paper this morning . Did you know that 70 % of people our age are sexually active ? And 40 % have inhaled solvents . Really . So , uh ... which crowd do you want to hang with ? Are you suggesting that we have sex ? Well , you- - or inhale solvents . You know , it 's really up to you . I 'm just trying to be a gentleman . Well , the guys at the dealership wouldn 't sell me a Harley . They said I didn 't have enough money . Bummer . Did they have something cheaper ? Well , they had a Yamaha , but I didn 't have enough money for that , either . How much money do you have ? I have no money . You didn 't plan this out very well , did you ? No , sir , I did not . Hello . Something wrong ? Yes , something 's wrong , thanks to that mincing cretin Vincent Strudwick ! Hey , that 's my dad you 're talking about . Oh , I am so sorry , honey . What was I thinking ? Would you please leave so I can trash your father ? But we- - get out ! Dick ! Tommy ... I don 't know how to break this to you . Oh , my god . What is it ? Try to stay calm . Here it comes . 7 years ago , my beloved Mary had a torrid affair with Vincent Strudwick . Oh , god . I thought it was going to be something I cared about . Hey , Dick . Harry ? There 's no good way to hear something like this . You might want to sit down . Albright dorked Strudwick . I almost sat down for that ? The universe is out of balance . Nothing makes sense anymore . Strudwick gets everything I deserve . If it 's not a cappuccino machine , it 's a book deal . If it 's not a book deal , it 's Mary . If it 's not Mary , it 's ... a cappuccino machine . Well , maybe you should even the score . Yes . Yes ! I could sleep with Strudwick 's wife ! Well , I was thinking you could get a cappuccino machine . Wait . Dick , you 're talking about sleeping with my girlfriend 's mother ? Uh-huh . Don 't you see ? Alissa looks up to her mom . If you do that , it 'll undermine all of her morality , all of the values that she spent years trying to instill in Alissa . That is so perfect ! Pave the way for the little guy , Caligula ! Hey , hey ! What ? We could take them out together ! What could be cooler than double-dating with your dad ? ! Yes ! Yeah ! How fast will this baby go ? You want to go faster , baby ? Oh , yeah ! Let 's go faster , baby ! You got it , baby ! Aaah ! Redline it , baby ! Redline this hog ! This is a hospital zone , baby . Do it , baby ! Do it ! Pop a wheelie ! Yeah ! Aaaah ! Sally : that 's it , baby . Taste the asphalt ! [ Doorbell rings ] Hello , Alissa . Tommy forgot his air freshener . What ? He was supposed to forget his book bag , but he forgot to forget it . Oh , thank you , Dick . Ok . Bye . Oh , uh ... as long as I 'm here , is your father at home ? No . Is your mother at home ? Yeah , but she 's in the shower . Oh . In the shower . Then my work is half done . Aah ! Ohhh ! Hi , Dottie . D-Dr . Solomon ? Oh , call me Dick . Please , sit down . What are you doing here ? Let me explain . You see , 7 years ago , your husband slept with my girlfriend Mary Albright ? Vincent ? Slept with Mary ? Yeah , I know . It 's an outrage . But let 's address the situation like rational adults . For the sake of both our relationships , you and I need to sleep together . Agreed ? I don 't believe this . Well , I know , but it 's the only way . Fortunately , we 're both very attractive , so it needn 't be an unpleasant experience . Oh , I am going to get him ! Now you 're talking . What say we climb back into that shower and get it on , huh ? Hey , mom ? Oh , my god ! Uh , Alissa , please . Your mother and I need to make love . So , uh ... shall we leave these adults alone and adjourn to the jacuzzi ? Ohhh ! Ohhhh ! Ohh . What just went wrong here ? I honestly don 't know . Doing Ok in there , Donny ? Mmmm . Boy , he don 't look so good , do he ? Down at the precinct , they 're calling him the human scab . Ok , how 's my patient doing ? What ? You mean the skinless wonder ? I 'm referring to Don . Or as we 're calling him here ... Don tartare . Ol ' gravelback ! How about the amazing colossal scab ? I already had the human scab . Yeah , that was good , too . Mine 's just a bit more ... clever . Sally : oh , Don ! Don ! Look at you ! [ Groans ] That is Don , right ? Yeah . Oh , Don ! How is it he looks like that , and you look like that ? Well , you see , we were going into the skid , and , uh , I ... I just used Donny 's body as a sled . [ Groans ] Oh , god . He was so heroic . Now look at you . All prone , helpless ... tied up . See , it never fails . Babes love guys on machines . Well , that 's good for Don , 'cause he 's gonna be hooked up to that mechanical bladder for quite a while . I think it 's sexy . Have you gotten Dottie Strudwick on the phone ? She keeps hanging up . Please clean up your phone manners , Nina . I 'm trying to sleep with this woman . You 're having me call so you can sleep with her ? Oh , Nina . You 're right--that is so impersonal . I 'll bring her flowers and candy . No , no ! Just flowers . I don 't want her fat . What 's the rush ? Oh , I 'm off to the florist , then sex with Dottie Strudwick , then , hey , what say I swing by and pick you up for a celebratory dinner at Mario 's , huh ? Lovely . I don 't know how the hell he thinks he 's gonna get a reservation at Mario 's- - Nina , what did he just say ? He 's going to the florist . No , no , no , no . After that , but before Mario 's ? Strudwick 's . Oh , my god ! Dottie . Dottie ? Are you home ? The door was open ! Dick : Dottie ? Are you home ? The door was open ! Mary , what are you doing here ? I came here to stop you from doing something completely irrational . Mary , please . It 's perfectly rational . I 'm evening the score with Strudwick . It doesn 't even involve you . What ? ! Oh , god . Now I 've got to explain things to Dottie . Oh , no , don 't . I want to keep her mad . Anger breeds revenge . Strudwick : Dottie ? Dottie ? Honey , the front door was wide open- - Dick . Mary . What the hell is going on ? What are you doing here , Strudwick ? This is my master suite . Why the hell are you here ? I 'm trying to stop Mary from talking to your wife ! About what ? Oh , like you don 't know . Oh , my god . No , no . She 's got to understand that what happened between us was a mistake . I didn 't know it was a trial separation . Mary , what are you thinking ? What is going on out here ? Hi , pumpkin . Pumpkin ? ! Who are you calling pumpkin ? Should I turn off the jets , Dottie ? Dottie , what is our pool guy doing here ? Oh , my god ! You have a pool ? ! It 's all out in the open , Vincent . You and your dirty little secret . We were separated . It was a trial separation ! I did not know that at the time . Oh ! Oh , for god 's sake , Dottie ... I 'll get dressed . What a ripoff . Look what you 've done . Oh , me ? You 're the one who had the fling with a married Strudwick and then got drunk and blabbed all about it . Ok ... Dick , you 've got to understand . I had a life before I met you . But I didn 't . I feel like my life on earth started when I met you . You 're the only thing that 's been mine and mine alone . In the " Mary " column , it 's always been Dick , one , Strudwick , zero . And now it 's a tie . Well , if it would make you feel any better , you 've been to the plate a hell of a lot more times than he has . Oh , Mary . Oh , Dick . Now let 's go to Mario 's . Dick ? I 'll meet you there . I 'm gonna go pee in his pool . Dick ! Don . Ohhh ! Sally . What are you doing here ? I had to come . We 've been apart too long . I must be with you . I don 't have any skin . Ow ! I can 't resist you any longer . Ohhh ! Shh ! I 'll be gentle . Aaaah ! Oooh ! Ohhh ! Oh . Ah . So , Tommy , how did Alissa take all this ? Well , she kicked me very hard in the , uh , swimsuit area . Oooh . Oooh . But that counts as second base action , right ? Well , in my book it does . You know , these Terry-Go-rounds are really comfortable . Yeah , they really are . It 's the towel that wears like a pants . Hmmm . Hmmm . Hey , Dick , you feeling any better ? Ohh , a little . But , you know , there 's still an empty space on my scorecard . Everyone else in the game ... everyone but me ... has gotten some forbidden nookie . What 's up with that ? Hon , I think it 's time to let it go . Oh , you 're right . The past is past . Time only moves in one direction on this planet . I just have to move on . Oh , who am I kidding ? I can 't let it go ! [ Doorbell rings ] Hello . You don 't know me , but my girlfriend 's ex-Lover 's wife slept with your husband . Excuse me ? Ok , that 's not important . What 's important is that the universe is out of balance , and the only way for us to bring some measure of justice to the world is for you and me to make love . Man : what 's going on there , Carmen ? Hi , Dick . Nooooooo !

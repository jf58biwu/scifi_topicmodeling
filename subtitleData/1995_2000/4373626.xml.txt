 No enemy activity to report . Currently 7.5 M.S.K. ' s out . Hey , Brandt , count you in for poker later ? Boys , some things in life are inevitable . The sun 'll rise , the Niners won 't make the play-offs , and I 'll lose my shirt at poker . That 's a negative . Come on , Brandt . Come clean . The 35th is flying in tonight . You know you want some time with Captain Oakes . - I 'll neither confirm nor deny . - The Faithful 's flying in too ? It seems like every squadron in the Fifth Wing is being called to the Saratoga . Rumor has it the brass has something big planned . Okay , lose the scuttlebutt over the radio . You know better . This is Yellow Jacket . I got an angel on the LIDAR . Confirm . Negative . Roger that . Negative . Just a Toga at 5.8 M.S.K. ' s . Juke right ! Juke right ! - What happened ? - I got no bandits , visual or HUD ! - What the hell is going on ? - Someone talk to me ! Good-bye , John . We thought we were alone . We believed the universe was ours . Until one night in 2063 , on an Earth colony six light years away ... they struck . And now , we 're at war . My name is Lieutenant Colonel T.C. McQueen . I 'm an InVitro ... a race of artificially gestated humans . I command a Marine Corps squadron ... the 58th . They call us the Wild Cards . We fight when called ... in space , on land and at sea . To lose this war means more than defeat . To surrender is to never go home . All of us must rise to the call above and beyond . You 're working that olive like it had bought you jewelry . Well , I 'm over this month 's limit , but I know ... there 's another drink 's worth in this pimento . Shame the nun there still has this and last month 's limit . Oh , but it 's goin ' fast . Hey , Shane , what 's with you ? You 've been , I don 't know , kind of weird ... ever since they said the 35th was flying in . I don 't know . I ... I can 't help this feeling ... something 's gonna happen , you know ? Somethin 's comin ' . Is this ' cause of all the talk ... about the old man planning a big offensive ? No . I think I know what her problem is . Seven months in space can make a girl fidgety . And this ship is looking awfully gray and cold . And I , for one , am getting sick and tired ... of looking at nothing but rivets . Ace to the king . Three to the Finn . Queen to the joker . And a bullet to G.I. Geequed . And I don 't even need to see another card . I 'm out . What ? You guys are seeing my cards in a mirror or something , right ? Ahh ! I thought InVitros were supposed to be bad gamblers . Well , don 't look at me . Talk to McQueen . Talk to Colonel McQueen . Corner pocket . Are you sure ? I 'm gone . - Can I buy in ? - Pull up a chair , marine . - You guys seen any action ? - We 're the 58th . Not bad . I 'm with the 35 . What do you hear about why all these squadrons are being called in ? Ante up . I ordered a double shot of J.D. Well , sorry , zoomie . No billet , no fill it . I 'm here to drink to the memory of a pilot who this very day was killed in action . You think you 're gonna stop me 'cause I don 't have a drink ticket ? Listen up , you maggot . You got about a heartbeat ... to set me up with a double shot of J.D. So that I can honor that memory . You reading ' me loud and clear ? Set us up . Friend of yours ? More than a friend . Then here 's to Lt. Brandt . You look older . You don 't look like a boy anymore . I 'm not . He disappeared about a hundred of these ago . A hundred " more than just a friend " ? She 's the only one I 've ever felt this way about ... since you . Some soldiers we talked to at Fort Bradley said ... they heard we 're going to land an invasion force at Hermes ... then planet-hop to a full-scale invasion of the Chigs ' home planet . They don 't know the Chigs ' home planet . That 's not what I heard . I think we go in around Cerces . They 're calling all the squadrons in for an air strike at Cora . There 's not gonna be any air strikes if they don 't figure out what 's going on out there . The entire 42nd Squadron got it today . Killed Captain Oakes ' girlfriend , Lt. Brandt . No one knows what hit ' em . There was no Chig squadron on the LIDAR ? Nothin ' ? It 's no squadron . One plane . Chigs always fly in groups . Not this one . Air force guys in the Feynman region are calling it " Chiggie Von Richthofen " . - Chiggie what ? - Manfred Von Richthofen . German ace of aces in World War I. They called him the Red Baron . Have they seen it ? They say don 't even look . 'Cause if you see it , you 're dead . You might as well be talking about ghosts and werewolves , because there is no such thing . There is no Chiggie Von Richthofen . You sound like a bunch of old women at a quilting bee . If the admiral has plans , we 'll know about it soon enough . Till then , I raise two . The worst thing is , why isn 't she here tonight ? No one will tell me . It wasn 't a classified mission . There was no reports of alien activity . No asteroids in the area . No one will say why . Even if you had a detailed report , you 'd still be wondering why . It 's the most-asked question . Why did things turn out this way ? Thanks for the drinks . Gentlemen , the mission you are about to undertake is classified " compartmentalized " . The objective is to deploy ... a miniature intelligence - and-reconnaissance-gathering satellite ... into a polar orbit over the planet Helios in the Ceres region . As you know , this is deep in enemy-occupied territory . Sir ... we 've heard talk about an alien craft . - Is there anything ... - There is no such craft . Aye , aye , sir . Stand by for Hammerhead launch sequence ... in 10 , nine , eight ... seven , six , five ... four , three , two , one . Launch . Ooh . What the hell is that ? The second plane was shot down moments afterwards . Rumors of its existence are rampant . At what point do we inform our people ? Inform them of what ? Our pilots never had time to describe it . It 's cloaked or scrambled the D.M.S. So no one can see it on playback . We don 't know what it is . All we know is what it can do ... and we appear to be helpless to stop it . Atten-hut ! Be seated . Now , I 'm here to ask an entire squadron ... to volunteer for a classified mission in the Ceres region . - Sir , I volunteer the 58th Squadron . - I volunteer the 35th Squadron . Sir , you specified an " entire squadron " . Regretfully , the 35th is down a man due to a recent casualty . Sir , the 35th Squadron has flown extensive missions within the Ceres region . Respectfully , we have more experience , sir . Experience is what we need . You get the call , 35 . - Thank you , sir . - Sir . In that case , I volunteer to fill in the 35th 's vacant slot . Colonel ? This is an important mission . Vansen 's an excellent pilot . Very well . 35 , Colonel McQueen and Lt. Vansen ... remain in the " O " room for briefing . All others , dismissed . I 've been looking everywhere . - Time to go ? - In a few minutes . - Let 's go back inside . - When this is out here ? Right there , right in the top center area ... the Sea of Serenity . That 's where I did my marine corps high-intensity survival training . Mmm . It must have been even more beautiful to stand up there and look back . Only ' cause I knew you were back here . This song was brought here on an optical disk so I could play it tonight . This is for Marine Lt. John Oakes and Shane Vansen . What is this ? It 's 95 years old . It 's sung by a woman named Patsy Cline . It was playing the night that my dad proposed to my mom . And now , it 's playing the night that I propose to you . Shane , will you marry me ? I mean , maybe not now , if you don 't want . It looks like I 'll be stationed on the U.S.S. Lincoln for a while . - Baby ... - Shane , I know what it 's like to be away from you . For months , let alone . I can 't take it . I can 't envision a life without your eyes looking into mine . I have no doubt , no fear ... I could happily belong to you ... forever . Look at the moon . Tomorrow night , it 'll set in a different spot . A week from now , only half of it will shine . In two weeks ... you won 't even know that it 's there . All that I believe is that ... no one can know how things will be different , how things will change . The only certainty is now ... and I sure don 't believe in forever . So ... that 's a " no " ? No . That 's a ... " Let 's see where the moon is in five years . " 35th , you are about to participate in Operation Shadow Watch . The objective is to deploy ... a miniature intelligence - and-reconnaissance-gathering satellite ... into a polar orbit over the planet Helios . Gentlemen , respectfully ... I was briefed on Operation Shadow Watch . I am not questioning the validity of the mission nor its objectives . However , the use of an entire squadron ... to deploy one MIRG and the nature of the directives ... indicates to a veteran pilot ... that the rumors of an alien ace out there are true . It does exist . And , gentlemen , respectfully ... my senior officers appear scared . We believe it is a new form of fighter ... and there is most likely just one being tested . Then that 's what our pilots need to be told . It 's imperative to keep this under wraps . We 're not keeping anything under wraps . We simply cannot have any cause for hesitation during engagement , Colonel . Hesitation ? These are our people ! You give us everything you 've got , and we 'll go out and hunt it down . And what are you gonna look for , Colonel ? No one has ever lived to see it . Our pilots will never know unless they are told of this situation . Sir , respectfully ... you 're sending them into the dark without a light . Colonel . What I am about to divulge ... is our greatest military secret . I expect you to act responsibly with the information . Deployment of the MIRG satellite is the first small step in ending this war . Sometime in the coming weeks , the forces of Earth ... will engage in a major offensive ... landing a massive expeditionary force ... in the Ceres star system . The fifth planet from Helios ... we have learned , is the enemy 's home . We will attack aggressively ... and drive the Chigs to defeat and surrender . Yes , sir . Aggressively , sir . This plan cannot be diverted ... by an obstacle that no one can substantiate . Gentlemen , until it is clear what we are up against ... we are not to reveal the existence of this alien craft . In the 35th , we prefer to patrol using a defensive combat spread . Since the Chigs fly in swarms , we attack using ... a strike-rejoin-strike , loose deuce engagement . Why not a bracket attack ? It keeps the squadron fighting as a team . In all honesty , Sullivan is a great wingman . Chambers is okay . Some of the others are weak . Sullivan and me can do more damage using the others as support . I don 't have that problem with the 58th . I 'd fight with any of ' em . Yeah , well , we fly in hotter zones . The competition is tougher . That 's why I want you to hang back on our six . I 'm told you fly a tight tack turn . If me and Sullivan get in a fur ball , you 'll be there for me . Won 't you ? You know I will . So why did you volunteer ? It 's my duty to volunteer for any assignment . One minute , you 're competing with me using the 58th . The next minute , you turn your back on them . I would never turn my back on them . I just hope you 're not risking your life in order to make it up to me . 'Cause if you are , don 't go . Now you 're one of them ? - Lieutenant . - Sir . - Good luck . - Thank you , sir . - Lieutenant . - Sir . - Good luck . - Thank you , sir . - Lieutenant . - Captain . Remember , I want you to remain on my maximum six in formation . Yes , sir . I know pilots never wanna talk about this ... but for me , prior to each mission I like to shake everyone 's hand ... in case it 's for the last time . Never told any of the others that . Then why are you telling me , sir ? - Is that mike hot ? - No . For telling you this , I could be court-martialed . There is something out there . An alien ace , or a new weapon . Suspect everything . Assume nothing . If engaged , get the hell out . Consider anything you see compartmentalized ... and then report back only to me . Colonel . Am I doing the right thing ? - This is an important mission . You 're an outstanding pilot . - Am I doing the right thing ? You mean if you 're doing it just for him ? There has to be something beyond this war . 15,000 M.S.K. ' s from Helios . Commencing radio silence . The MIRG got waxed ! I 'm goin ' hot ! Vansen , maintain radio silence . LIDAR 'S reading a malfunction in the payload assist module . Bogey , 9 : 00 low , movin ' back on our six . I got nothing on the HUD . Confirm . Confirm ! Confirm ! It 's locked on ! Chaff and jink ! Fox one ! Bogey dope . Engage A.C.M. Negative ! Negative ! Enemy is superior ! Get the hell out of Dodge ! Roger that . Return to Home Plate . You broke radio silence . You revealed our position . I had visual contact of an enemy craft ! Our orders were not to divulge our presence ! I saw no such craft . What the hell else killed those men ? If you hadn 't ... Sullivan saw no such craft on HUD or visual ! If you had listened to me instead of the damned HUD ... - there would be three marines standing here with us ! - We don 't know that ! Now , I was the commanding officer , Vansen ! For once , I 'm supposed to call the shots between us ! At ease , both of you ! Speak , Captain . Lt. Vansen claims to have visually contacted an alien aircraft . Neither myself , Lt. Sullivan nor LIDAR saw any such craft . Lt. Vansen broke radio silence ... abandoned formation ... and then the lieutenant told us to turn tail and run . Now , I don 't know if that 's how the 58th flies , but in the 38th ... I said , get back ! I was there for you , as ordered . Lieutenant . You were ordered not to reveal your position . Now , what evidence did you have of enemy activity ? I am not at liberty to discuss such evidence at the present time . What the hell is that supposed to mean ? Now she 's just trying to cover her ass . Make a report , Captain . It was approximately 17 meters . Equal-distant tri-wing . Span : 10 to 15 meters . Angle of attack was much more pronounced than standard enemy attack spacecraft . I did not detect any indication ... of the craft 's position on my SA-43 LIDAR . And I believe that it is capable of broadcasting false information . The craft had a fuselage . It was bullet-shaped . And I didn 't get a very good look ... however , the nose had been marked . Writing ... English ... and a crude human skull . Could you discern its message ? It read ... " Abandon All Hope . " Aces over eights . I ain 't doin ' as good as I was the other night . It 's ' cause Vansen 's back . And for as much as she hates the A.I. ' s , she sure gambles like one . - Who 's light ? - Vansen . You in ? - Vansen ? - Let her go . That jukebox has every Patsy Cline song but ours . It 's just as well . Look , I checked out the cockpit 's D.C.L. replays and read Sullivan 's report . I just cleared my head ... and I know ... you were there for me ... this time . I 've always been there . I hate the words you said to me that night . Because I 've come to believe them . It all started that night . We drifted away after I could never imagine you being out of my life . The war began ... after everyone thought there 'd never be another . Promotions , reassignments . Shane ... I 've seen so many people die . John , I 'm so sorry that she 's not here . But I 'm not sorry that I am . Do you still not believe in forever ? Yeah . Only , unlike that night , I 'll no longer surrender to it . The more something in life seems inevitable , the harder I fight it . And I now know that giving your life to someone doesn 't have to mean dying . And I always wished that night , I had given you mine . Hey , guys , it 's true . There is a Chiggie Von Richthofen . Ross announced that we 're all to report to a briefing at 0700 . They believe one alien fighter is responsible ... for wiping out the 19th , the 31st and the 42nd Squadrons . They confirmed it 's what killed Lt. Brandt . Somewhere out there in the darkness ... hiding ... is an enemy craft that has killed your comrades . If not destroyed , it will kill you . Not this day . This morning , you will participate in Operation Red Baron . Now , hear this , C.F.B. Your objective is to search for and remove this enemy spacecraft from my sky . Colonel . Naval engineers have theorized the Chigs are experimenting ... with an advanced LIDAR signaling processing technology ... which allows this fighter to cloak itself to our electronics . Sir . How do we detect it ? When a plane in your formation goes down ... you 'll know you 're in the school yard . All our plans are on hold until this Chig is destroyed . We do not intend to wait around while the enemy advances ... watching people die ... until a group of pencil-pushing , rear-echelon engineers ... can develop a new technology to combat the enemy . Today , you will go out there ... find this bastard , and you pile on ! Captain . For this mission , we thought you might want this . - Welcome aboard . - Thank you . Clear the flight deck . Prepare for Hammerhead engagement series . Fighting Finns , this is Saratoga . What is your position ? Saratoga , this is Finns . We are 15 M.S.K. ' s from Helios heading 0-niner . I 'm taking fire ! Two planes are down ! I can 't see any ... Well , we found him . What 's the nearest squadron to that region ? It 's the 58th Squadron , sir . The Wild Cards . " Abandon All Hope " my ass . Saratoga , this is Wild Cards . Current position is five M.S.K. ' s above Helios , currently ... It 's him ! Bandit , 5 : 00 low ! Jink ! This is Oak Tree . I 'm hit . Hold on , John . I 'm comin ' for you . Negative , negative . My weapons are disabled . I 'm losing power . I got a visual . He 's on our six ! Regroup ! Regroup ! We 're on his six . Bring smoke ! I 've lost contact . He 's locked on Vansen . The cannons ain 't doin ' jack ! I can 't shake him ! John . We have 20 SAR teams already on the planet . Shane . I saw a flash beneath the clouds . I bet he ejected his cockpit . - They 'll find him . - His Hammer didn 't explode on impact with the Chig . I 'm sure he made it . Colonel McQueen . SAR 10 reporting in , sir . - Queen Six to SAR 10 . What do you got ? - Found him , sir . SAR teams have found no remains of Chiggie Von Richthofen . He eluded the kill . He 's still out there . John ? Where are you going ? To fight the inevitable . Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

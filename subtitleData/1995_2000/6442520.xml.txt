 - That 's a little hard to believe . - Really ? No , I 'm pretty much of a homebody . But all that changed . Just from your words , the way you saw things , I knew I wanted to meet you . Well , I hope you 're not too disappointed . Lauren , we have a real connection . Which is rare . - Most men don 't feel that way . - Most men don 't know what they 're missing . What ? I can 't believe this . I mean , I can 't believe that after three months we finally meet in person and you 're ... I don 't know , I 'm just really enjoying myself tonight . Oh , no ! Here , let me help you . My sister gave it to me . For good luck , I guess . Kind of dopey , huh ? I mean , a clover leaf . How blatant can you get ? It 's beautiful . Thank you . Cock-a-doodle-doo ! Rise and shine in there . Mother of God . Dispatch , this is car 7-3 . I got a DP out on the lakefront at Erie and Capitol ... We 're not certain , but from the driver 's license we suspect it 's Lauren Mackalvey . - I want you to get on it . - All right , we 'll check this out . Agent Mulder ? Alan Cross , Cleveland PD . Thanks a lot for coming out so quickly . This is my partner , Dana Scully . We found the purse in the front seat of that car . According to the license , her name is Lauren Mackalvey . But ... we 're not sure yet that this is her body . - You 're not sure ? - We couldn 't make a positive ID , considering . Wendy Sparks , our Bureau liaison , thought this would be ... closer to your area of expertise . Any indication as to the cause of death ? We were just lucky to get her into the bag without her body falling apart . This substance . Did you find it anywhere else in the car ? - On the carpet or the upholstery ? - As a matter of fact , no . - So , it was only on the victim 's body ? - That 's what it looks like . Why ? - Do you have an idea what happened here ? - No . Not yet . We 'll call you when we find anything else concrete . - Detective ? - Yeah , sure . Call me . Mulder , what do you think it is ? A couple of months ago a case came my way from the Mississippi office . Four Aberdeen women had disappeared within a month . - Disappeared ? - Only one victim was found . But her body was too decomposed to perform a viable autopsy . - What we just saw was not decomposition . - I know . - I want you to run this by the coroner . - What about you ? Where are you going ? I 'm gonna try to find out if Lauren Mackalvey was a lonely heart . All the Aberdeen victims had answered personal ads in the local papers . If this is the same killer , he 's just getting started . Yes , what is it ? The handyman replaced the locks on the storage closets and ... I wanted to bring by your new key . I know what you do , Mr Incanto . What is it you think that I do ? Well , your typing , and those packages from publishers in New York . You 're a novelist , right ? Or an editor ? You see , I 'm a writer too . What a coincidence . Shouldn 't you be off writing or something ? I don 't mean to impose . But would you mind reading something of mine ? It won 't take much time . They 're poems . Certainly . Goodbye . - Oh , it 's you . - That 's not a problem , is it ? No . It 's just that Dr Kramer didn 't tell me that you were observing the autopsy . I 'm not observing . I 'm performing it myself . - You 're a medical doctor ? - You sound surprised . I don 't know . I guess maybe I am . Why ? It 's nothing personal , Agent Scully . I 'm just old-fashioned in certain regards . - Old-fashioned ? - The truth is , I question the wisdom of assigning female law-enforcement officers to certain cases . Like this one ? Whoever killed Lauren Mackalvey has a definite attitude toward women . So it has to affect yourjudgment . I appreciate your concern , Detective . But it 's not necessary . All I wanna do is solve this case . Just like you . Look , I 'm not being sexist here . I 'm just being honest . Where would you like the autopsy report sent ? You can fax it to my office . The date is August 29th , the time is 4 : 15pm . The subject 's name is Lauren Mackalvey . Caucasian , female . Approximate time of death uncertain , cause of death unknown . Itjust doesn 't make sense . He seemed so ... nice . I thought you never met the man Lauren was with . I never did . He just seemed nice on the computer . - Oh , they met through an on-line service ? - In one of those chat rooms . You know , where people get together to talk about whatever they 're into . Do you remember what chat room Lauren was in when she met him ? Big and Beautiful . She had kind of a weight problem . But 2Shy didn 't seem to care . It wasn 't about sex with him . - 2Shy ? - That was his on-line name . Lauren used to ... read me his letters . They were amazing . He knew exactly what to say . Sure as hell fooled me . She read you his letters . Do you think that she kept any hard copies of ' em ? Actually ... I saved them myself . - I can get them for you . - Yes . Can I use your phone ? It 's right over there . - Scully . - Listen , Scully . Our killer may have moved from the personals to the Internet . - I 'm gonna send a localized on-line warning . - How do you know it 's the same guy ? He opened the account with an Aberdeen victim 's credit card . I just called the on-line service . Meet me in the coroner 's office as soon as you can . - Why ? Did you find anything in the autopsy ? - There 's not going to be an autopsy . It 's a metacarpal from Lauren Mackalvey 's hand . In life , bones have the tensile strength of iron . Even in death they remain strong . But look at this . - What did this turn out to be ? - It 's organic . Mostly hydrochloric acid , similar to what is secreted by the gastric mucosa . - It 's similar to stomach acid ? - Almost identical , only twice as acidic . I also found trace amounts of pepsin , which is a digestive enzyme . So you 're saying that this did that ? I don 't know how else to explain such accelerated autolysis . OK , what 's in here should contain the same cellular components as her various tissues . - Skin , muscle , blood . - In some broken-down form , yes . In your chemical analysis results , was anything missing ? - Missing ? - Yeah . I don 't think so . All the body tissues were accounted for . Well , except there were extremely low , almost trace amounts of adipose . Fatty tissue . - That 'd explain the weight discrepancy . - What weight discrepancy ? The ME recorded Lauren 's weight at 122 . But her driver 's license had her at 165 . She probably lost weight since the license was issued . Her roommate said she was nervous about the meeting because she 'd put on some weight recently . What possible motivation could the killer have for removing his victim 's fatty tissue ? - Who do you think we 're dealing with here ? - I don 't know . God , I look awful . Please tell me it 's the mirror . Ellen , this wasn 't some public-service announcement . It was an on-line warning by the FBI aimed specifically at women in Cleveland . Give me some credit , will ya , Jo ? I happen to be a pretty good judge of character . - I 'm not trying to freak you out or anything . - No ? - Well , you 're doing a pretty good job of it . - I just think you should be careful , that 's all . Do you think this is easy for me ? I finally connect with someone I like who seems to like me . I 'm scared enough to meet him without you telling me he 's Charles Manson . I didn 't say that . Besides , it 's not like he 's some stranger . I 've been chatting with him every day for over a month . I know . And he 's probably as great as he sounds . But what if he isn 't ? Check it out . Want a little chocolate tonight ? Down here . We got what you need over here . Would you like some of this ? - See something you like ? - Do you want some ? - I think he has the hots for you , baby . - I think so . What do you like , baby ? No kissing ' . Anything else you want is fine . But no kissin ' . What are you doin ' ? There 's a place we can go near here . - Nice and cosy . - OK . Forget this . Oh , my God ! Make sure you get statements from all of them . Holly McClaine . She 's worked this area for a couple of years now , but she wasn 't mostjohns ' first pick , if you know what I mean . - What happened ? - Well , it looks like our guy again . - One of the girls found her . - The airways are blocked with what appears to be the same viscous acid we found on Lauren . You know what this stuff is ? This is still my case . He 's a serial murderer who 's using an on-line service to attract his victims . - All single women looking for Mr Right . - That doesn 'tjibe with a $ 20 hooker . No . Something must have gone wrong last night . He was forced to improvise . So it 's a guy without a consistent MO . Not necessarily . These are letters he e-mailed to Lauren Mackalvey . They contain lines from a handful of sixteenth-century Italian poems . So he has a copy of Bartlett 's Quotations . So what ? - You won 't find these in Bartlett 's . - I 'm not sure I follow you . Look at this . La Vita Nuova , Castiglione 's II Cortegiano , a few I won 't try to pronounce . These are from obscure texts from private libraries that only lend to academic affiliates . You 're saying our suspect 's a professor ? Or a graduate student , maybe a translator . We need to compile a list of everybody in Cleveland who has these credentials . - Can you do that ? - Yeah . I 'll get right on it . Here 's something else that might help . The killer should have an identifiable wound pattern from this . Looks like she took her pound of flesh , huh ? Yes ? I got a package for Incanto from Stracher Publishing . - Leave it . - Sorry . I gotta get a signature . Hello , Mr Incanto . - Good afternoon , Jesse . - Jesse , did you find those drop cloths yet ? Oh , Mr Incanto , I didn 't know you were out here . I 'm just picking up a package . Jesse , did you know that Mr Incanto 's a writer ? I know , Mom . You told me a thousand times . I 'm putting those poems together . If you don 't mind , I 'd like to drop them by sometime . Just slip it under my door . After you 've read them , can I take you to dinner somewhere ? - Gimme a break . - Actually , I 'm busy . I have a deadline . - Oh , I don 't believe this . - Excuse me ! - I wish you weren 't always so rude to him . - I don 't care . He creeps me out . Plus he smells gross . Like he uses dish soap for aftershave . OK . There you go . Thanks . OK . Blaine just gave me the list from the university . - How 's it going ? - Good . We 've expanded the search to include the faculty rosters from the local community colleges . We ... - Excuse me . - Sure . I 'll let you know what we turn up . - Find anything ? - We 're almost done with the list . That skin under the fingernails ? The lab checked the DNA results against the \ x22known offenders \ x22 database . And ? - They didn 't find a match . - They did find something else . Check the next page where it 's circled . \ x22The skin sample contains no oils or essential fatty acid . \ x22 Any number of factors could cause that result . Where are you going with this ? OK , it 's not yet the finely detailed insanity you expect from me . It 's just a theory . But what if this isn 't a psychotic impulse , but rather some physical hunger ? Maybe he needs to replenish this chemical deficiency to survive . From a dry skin sample , you 're concluding that he 's a fat-sucking vampire ? How else can you explain Mackalvey 's missing adipose ? I bet the Aberdeen victims would show the same thing . This killer secretes a substance which renders the victim 's fat ... Which he ingests before the rest of the body dissolves entirely . There are examples in nature , aren 't there ? Yeah , scorpions predigest their food outside of their body by regurgitating onto their prey . But I don 't know too many scorpions who surf the Internet . If I 'm right , we 're notjust looking for a serial murderer , but a genetically different human being who may be responsible for who knows how many missing persons cases throughout the country . I 've combed every faculty list in Cleveland . Came up with 38 names . If we divvy up the list , and put some more people on it ... - All right . - I 'd like to brief them , if that 's OK with you . Sure . You have mail . Mr Brenman ? I 'm Special Agent Scully from the FBI . Would you mind if I ask you some questions ? Thanks . I 'm sorry to bother you . I 'd like to ask you a few questions . Sure . These are all university addresses . Chances are he spent most of the morning on campus . Scully ? I 'm not much of a salesman . I knocked on more doors than ... Cross hasn 't checked in yet . We 've tried his cell phone , but there 's no answer . - I 'm treating you . - No , I insist . After the way I stood you up , I 'm the one who should insist . Please . - I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have ... - It 's eczema . I 've had it since I was a kid . You know , I still feel so stupid about the other night . Ellen , you don 't have to make any excuses . Whatever reasons you had , I 'm sure they were good ones . You were right , though . About me being afraid ? - It 's a pretty hard habit to break . - You 're not still afraid , are you ? - No , I 'm not . - Good . Unfortunately , I have to get going . The last crosstown bus leaves in 15 minutes . - You 're taking the bus home ? - My car 's in the shop . I 'll call you . - Don 't be silly . I 'll drive you . - Ellen , you don 't have to do that . I 'm driving you home . Mr Incanto ? So how long have you lived here ? - Not very long . - I only live a few blocks away , near St Mark 's . Until some developer decided to turn it into condos . You can still see the steeple . Ellen , you don 't have to be nervous . I 'm not very good at this . It 's been a long time since I 've been in this type of situation . It 's OK . Why don 't you come up with me ? I 'll read you that poem I told you about : \ x22I casoni . \ x22 I don 't know . It 's kinda late . Well , I don 't wanna say good nightjust yet . Do you ? You know what ? You 're right . It 's late . I have a lot of work I have to do . Excuse me . Mr Incanto ? - What is it , Jesse ? - Do you know where my mom is ? Your mother ? No . She takes a class down at St Frank 's tonight . A poetry class . And she was supposed to be home over an hour ago . I 'm sure she 'll be home soon . She didn 't stop by to say hi or anything ? No . Not tonight . OK . Thanks . She 'll probably be home soon . I 'm going to New York for a few days on business . Don 't worry about your mother . I 'm sure she 'll be fine . Yes , ma 'am , a police detective . His name 's Cross . That 's right , he would have been by sometime this afternoon . Sometime this morning . Do you remember what time specifically ? Could you describe him to me for verification ? Excuse me a minute . - Did you find him ? - We just got a 911 . A possible homicide from a young girl at one of the addresses on Cross 's list . Police ! We got two in here . Mulder ? The landlady 's body . We found her in the bathroom . What about Cross ? I know this is hard to talk about right now . But I need you to tell me exactly what happened . I smelled her perfume . Your mother 's perfume ? That 's when I knew he was lying . She was wearing her perfume when she left for her class . And you smelled it in his apartment ? I was scared that he 'd hurt me . I could tell he wanted to . - And when he grabbed me ... - He grabbed you ? After I bumped into the suitcase . He grabbed me pretty hard . - What suitcase ? - It was next to the door . He said he was going away on business or something . Did he say where ? New York . OK , Jesse . That helps us . I 'm gonna take a couple of minutes and go talk to Agent Mulder . Mrs Shepherd is right here . I 'll be right back . Agent Scully ? Why would someone do this ? I don 't know , Jesse . The composite artist made this sketch from a description . His name is Virgil Incanto . According to his rental agreement . But there 's no other record that the guy exists . There 's no DMV , no birth certificate , no Social Security , not even a bank account . - Employment records ? - He 's a translator of Italian . Freelance . His publisher pays him in cashier 's checks . He told the girl he was on his way to New York . I 'll check flight schedules and have the airport issue an APB . - What is it ? - He 's not goin ' to New York , Scully . Not now . He 's smarter than that . He knows how to survive , you know ? Well , how are we gonna track him ? He made contact with each of his victims , right ? - Yeah . - That means they 're all in here somewhere . Each one of ' em . Past , present and future . - All files have been deleted . - Any chance of resurrecting them ? It 's hard to say . He deliberately reformatted his hard drive . This guy didn 't want anyone looking at his stuff . The good news is , I can restore the erased files . And the bad news ? These files are all password protected and encrypted . - It could take some time . - We don 't have much time . It 'll take as long as it takes . Joanne ? Is that you ? - Who is it ? - Ellen , it 's me . - It 's late . - I know . And I 'd like not to wake your neighbors . - Can we talk about what happened tonight ? - There 's nothing to talk about . - You made it clear what you wanted . - You don 't understand . - I think I do . - Look , Ellen . I gave you a second chance after you made me wait in that restaurant . Give me the same courtesy , please . And then if you want me to go , I 'll go . Only let 's not do it out here . Thank you . You want some coffee ? I can make some . Yeah . I 'd like that . They 're coming up empty at the airport . So I 'm releasing the sketch to the media . We can still make the morning papers . That may not be necessary . - \ x22Friend \ x22 ? - Lauren 's on-line name . These are all his victims . A regular grocery list . We need this scanned and sent to everyone on that list . - Done . - I 'm gonna call the on-line service and have them fax us the telephone numbers of all those women . Machine 'll pick up . - Milk ? I only have nonfat . - No , no , no . This is fine . Give me a minute , will you ? I 'll put on some clothes . - Ellen , you don 't have to do that . - I want to . I 'll be right back . Just lock your doors until we contact you again . You 'll be fine , Ms Innes . He doesn 't tend toward forcible entry . OK , thanks . Cleveland PD have already reported three of the women on the list as missing . We 've already contacted everyone on this list directly , except for these two . - I left messages on their machines . - You 'd better go check on ' em anyway . You have mail . Ellen ? I hope you 're not on line with some other guy . I was just e-mailing my girlfriend . - Your girlfriend ? - Yes . What about ? - Us . - What were you telling her ? Just how happy I am . That you 're still interested in me . And that you hadn 't rejected me like I thought you had . I 'm glad you feel that way , Ellen . - I know I do . - Look . I still haven 't changed my clothes . Go wait outside and I 'll be right out . You look beautiful . You don 't need to change for me . Please leave me alone . Please . What do you want ? Can I help you ? We 're with the FBI . We 're looking for Ellen Kaminsky . She 's in her condo . She just e-mailed me . Why ? What 's wrong ? - Is something the matter ? - Get back in . Ellen ? Mulder . You go ahead . I 'll stay here . Go . This is Federal Agent Dana Scully . I need an ambulance right away to 658 South Hudson Avenue , apartment number 23 . Request special chemical-burn unit . Freeze ! Federal agent . Now , put your hands up and step out where I can see you . Just don 't shoot me , man . Jennifer Flackett , Kathy Miller , Hillary Turk . 47 women reported missing in five states . At least give their families some peace of mind . Tell us how many on that list are yours . They 're all mine . Come on , Scully . Open the door . Why ? When you look at me you see a monster . But I was just feeding a hunger . You 're more than a monster . You didn 'tjust feed on their bodies . You fed on their minds . My weakness was no greater than theirs . I gave them what they wanted . And they gave me what I needed . Not anymore . I morti non sono più soli . The dead are no longer lonely . Let me out .

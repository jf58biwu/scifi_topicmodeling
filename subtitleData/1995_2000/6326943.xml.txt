Think Harkin transfers his consciousness from one body to another ? Apparently so . But it could be anyone . - Perhaps one of the colleges at Red Flag . - Yes , but who ? Do me a favor , Eddie . Check them all . I already did . I checked the profiles in the database Milcom . Vincent Lopez , Trevor Pain , Langley ... Everyone A1 . Although the data of Langley , were harder to find than others . Langley is one for which I worry . Will do anything to win . Trying to find his past , but a lot of things are classified . Okay , I check on Mr. Birch and Sergeant Plimpton . - Clone 's on their field . - I understand . Eddie , I found another room . An office full of files . - Some dating from 1862 - the year 's civil war . What 's the connection , buddy ? Harkin , Red Flag , RÄƒzboiul Civil . The aliens are here . But why ? Foster , listen to me . I think we should get out of there . I can not leave yet , Eddie . I do not know who 's aliens and how much control here . I have to go . I did not know anyone here . Not that it would be a problem . - Thanks for your help yesterday . - No problem . Few women have managed to lose it . I know of none . At first a unit of Marines , then , I moved to the military legal services . This will allow me to go into the arena of operations . Military service legal ? I spent two and a half , in courtrooms . Trust me you do not want to be there . I believe you . Sloane , maybe we can be a team . I keep my back and I 'll watch yours . What do you think ? - I think about it . - Do not think too much . Your task is to reach the enemy without being seen . Once again I congratulate you . You just sent the signal enemy ... " We 're here , come and kill us ! " Everyone head down . Creeping your hands and feet . I want to see their faces in the mud . As you show me some strategy and mental preparation . Come on , come on ! Come on , guys ! It 's your life . As in Honduras , is not it , Sloane ? Maybe this will motivate them . If you want to successfully negotiate Red Flag , then you better show enthusiasm for the mission . Remember , stress can be a positive factor . Use it as a motivator . Use it in your favor ! Hey , Lopez , how about you and me , to be together when all this is over ? - How about you shut up , Vincent ? - Anytime , baby . I saw you last night when you got out of bed . - Why ? - No reason . - I glanced around . - Sure . - What are you doing ? - I do not know , but so far ... I realized that some people would do everything to win the Red Flag . I think your family thinks you deserve to win . Otherwise you would not be back here . Right , Sloane . My family likes to win . No guts no glory . You are who you are . This thing does not make a difference ? What is Sloane ? You ask so many questions agents ? The only guy that I heard that Red Flag was won Harkin . Type died , was A1 . I wonder how someone from West Point , winner of the Red Flag , could get hurt it . I do not know the answer to this question , Sloane . But can I say this ... Red Flag worth winning . Not many people know about it . But those who know , there are people that matter . - Sloane , what are you doing here ? - Nothing , sir . I wanted to lie down for a few minutes . What the hell do you think this ? Holidays ! ? I 'm watching you , Sloane and do not like . Do you understand ? Move it ! Now , that 's right ... First , Trevor Pain , followed by Langley , Lopez and Vincent . Sloane remains down . This river is ready to receive five or six people . To proceed you need exceptional strength , talent , stability , and dedication and youth to appear on your faces . Go ahead , Pain ! Move it ! Calm down ! - Move , Pain ! - Come on ! Come on ! - What the hell ! ? - Hell , Vincent ! - Lift it ! - Come on , Trevor ! I burn your hands ! My hands ! You get out ! - Hold on ! - That 's it ! Someone to lead a rope ! Keep your head up ! Take this rope there ! Hurry ! Trevor , grab the rope ! Grab it ! Grab the rope ! Come on , someone to help him ! - Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . Well , Sloane , let me see your hands . - You tore loud . Does it hurt ? - Are you kidding ? It hurts like hell . Do not worry . I 'll make you feel better . Looks like someone burned it with a laser . Trevor could drown . You are a hero , Sloane ... for now . Enjoy while you can . - Foster , look horrible . - Today I had another failure . Trevor Pain was first and someone wanted to eliminate it . Who do you think did it ? Hard to say . I 'm sure Plimpton has something to do , maybe Langley . I have some news . You 'll like it . I did some checking on the Civil War . I talked to an expert Baresprings , Kansas . He believes in conspiracy theories . Believe that Red Flag is part of an independent military subsector , not part of the government , which handles promotions . Yeah , that 's a quick way to get into high positions . Now comes the main part . Red Flag was created by Lincoln during the Civil War in 1862 . The same year the files you 've found . Did you find Confederate spies , infiltrated the army . And aliens , doing the same thing they did it 137 years ago . Try to infiltrate spies as Harkin , in the army . - The easiest is to use the Red Flag . - Exactly . It is as a system of military culture . The best seed falls into the elite league . " Red Flag attract many of them , with each victory will be canceled . " If the aliens manage to infiltrate spies in the army , the Red Flag , I lost this war before we start to fight . Foster , listen ... You must be careful . I think the authorities should be involved . Eddie , you have to call you later . Do you understand it or not , there is no external communication ? Yes sir . See if you understand it . You are under house arrest . You can not leave this building . - You understand , Sloane ? - Yes sir . I think not . I 'll be more explicit . You 're not a competitor to Red Flag . Tomorrow morning you 'll be on the bus . We leave , Sloane . Where 's Sloane ? I heard it was removed from the program . Too bad . It seemed funny . - Since Birch talking to you ? - Do not talk . I heard them talking . Sloane was caught talking to his mother . - Sloane , I heard you were leaving . - That 's right , Langley . Apparently Birch and realized that you have what you need . How the hell do you know ? Because I know that ... and you win . Good for you , Langley . Maybe you 'll win enough to become one someday . Enough ! Tomorrow we will fight for Red Flag . No blow it . Freak ! Man , what about you ? What did you do to get the outside ? You saw the broken rope , Trevor . It was an accident . Someone does not want you to win Red Flag . I 'm just like everyone else in this room . What 's this about ? Here 's a bigger fight than Red Flag . A real battle for life and death . - I do not know what you mean . - Hey ! Enough talk and to bed ! Some of us have a big day tomorrow . You know what would be in danger if the enemy has infiltrated the Red Flag ? Well , that 's what happens . And I know that this enemy is Trevor . - Who ? - Come with me and I 'll show you . No . This means too much to me . Just a prize ... Let me tell you one thing ... You 're not far from Langley . - How are we doing ? - Trevor a win . - Red Flag is his . - What about Sloane ? He broke the rules and I removed . I will not let Sloane , or anyone else to take the Red Flag . If you want to win you must play properly . Special unit ass . Yes sir , the process is ongoing . The rating is 0573 . Has a sense unusually low , to show their skills . In fact , he 's led from the start . If you do not want to use the body , then propose eliminating it . No sir . I was told to take care of one body at a time . Yes , sir , I already did . I took a DNA sample and we have a new body . No , sir , not to jeopardize the operation . Colonel Birch knows it . Yes sir . Today one of you will get the Red Flag . This will undoubtedly be a big step in your life empty and worthless . Da , most domnule ! The first quality of a soldier are consistent , toil and suffering . Courage is after . Do you know who said that ? Napoleon . Here we seek individual effort . It 's the ultimate test of physical and mental abilities improve . I 'm sorry , sir , but there was a fire in the warehouse . - Has anyone seen Sloane ? - I bet he 's already on the bus . I do not care where they are . It has nothing to do with this mission . Caution ... Each of you will be left to a different location . You are in enemy territory . We will consider enemies and avoid any contact . 4272422 north , is 570,414 . This point is your goal . Red Flag . Right , Eddie . 4272422 north and 570 414 east . What 's that ? It 's called UTM . Universal transport marker . Metric used by the military ... For global positioning . It is also called East-North . - East 108 degrees ... - Enough , Eddie ! Where am I going ? In fact , you must go north . It seems that the exact location of the Red Flag . - It 's a high ridge . - Okay , I 'll be one step ahead , Eddie . A trap . Maybe today is the day when we catch a Gua . We require an alternative standard vector . Do not stop until you reach high levels . Thanks , buddy . - Hi , Langley ! - You bastard ! I know who you are , Langley . I know you 're one of them . - One of whom ? - Do not heal . - You 're not Gua . - Are you crazy , Sloane ? Are you crazy ? I just Red Flag . Okay ? Hurry up . Why not let the knife and let me pass . Drop the gun . - What are you doing , Sloane ? E Red Flag . - I do not think , Plimpton . I know who you are . I saw Trevor Pain clone . I heard that you want to replace it with an alien . The question is ... Who ? Lopez , I was wondering where you were . What are you doing with a gun ? - Where 's Vincent ? - I do not know . I did not see anyone . Except you , doll . Hands ... healed . So , are you , Lopez . You spy Gua , who 's Harkin ? I was Harkin , are now Lopez , and the next , Trevor Pain . Lopez , go ahead ! Now ! - Hey , Trevor ... - Hands on your head , Lopez . Come on , Trevor , he just wants to win Red Flag . And you deserve it , Trevor . It should be yours . Lopez ! I told you ! It 's mine ! At least human . If Lopez had won the Red Flag , Gua as a spy infiltrated deep into the military system . With access to the secrets of our defense system , had the capacity to destroy us from within . Eddie sent e-mails to all military units to warn about Gua . Hope remained some evidence to realize army facing . No , sir , unnecessary investigations . I have no idea where it is , but I assure you that is not on this basis . No , sir , I know nothing about any file , or other equipment . Yes , sir , if I find something , contact you immediately . Yes sir . Thank you sir . Trevor Pain , chose to fight in a war more important and gave up awards and medals . Pain winning Red Flag sacrificed to become a soldier against the Gua . Now is adept , and I consider him an ally . Moment will come when I will gather all followers and all allies . The time will come when we will end this war . Translation and adaptation - Florin ( c ) thin

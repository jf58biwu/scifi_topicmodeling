 [ Man Narrating ] Previously on The Pretender . [ Sydney ] His name is Angelo . Think ofhim like a sponge ... someone who can absorb the intellectual , emotional ... even the physical traits of others . He will find Jarod for us . [ Miss Parker ] He better , Sydney . Hejust better . [ Keyboard Clacking ] Yes , Mr. Parker . He 's searching the Internet for any signs of him now . We 'll find Jarod ... and whoever inside the Centre is helping him . [ Phone Hangs Up ] Keep working , Angelo . Keep working . - [ Explosion ] - [ Man ] Whoo-whee . ! You see ? Get too close to that bad boy ... and you 'll be a-picking your nose with your wrist . [ Chuckling ] Now , you boys are 21 , aren 't ya ? That 's what I thought . Fill up their trunk , Eugene . - Now , where were we ? - You were telling us about Mr. Nobel . Yeah , old Nobel was like a Picasso of gunpowder . - He invented the Big Bertha , you know . - The Big Bertha ? The mother of all Roman candles . Three time-delayed sparkle explosions ... wrapped in a color-spray smoke banger ... lined with quarter strands ofT.N.T. - Sounds impressive . - Put on a New Year 's Eve show ... that put old Dickie Clark to shame . [ Chuckling ] I don 't know where he went . Just disappeared . - Yes . - Hmm . He has a habit of doing that . Thank you . There is no way thatJarod could have known we were coming . Zero . Have you noticed that it never seems to work the other way , Syd ? Maybe there is a reason . Stay frosty , Nobel . It 's all being recorded for posterity . This way . The note that was faxed said we 'd find the bomb over here . - Carlson . - [ Beeping ] Hello . Fax Bomber 's usual . Whoa , cowboy . Betty needs her beauty rest , or she 's a real witch to wake up next to . Tools . Whoa . I found something . - Looks like a note . - He always leaves one . What 's it say ? " Catch me if you can , you miscreants . " " Miscreants " ? What does that mean ? [ Rapid Beeping ] It means " Get the hell outta here " ! Move ! Move ! [ Coughing ] Is it always like this ? Welcome to the Bomb Squad , Jarod . [ Man Narrating ] [ Chatter On Police Radio ] So , Nobel , now you know ... what a close encounter with the Fax Bomber feels like , huh ? Mm-hmm . Man , I wish I could have been here . Can 't imagine why , sir . - My ears are still ringing . - Used to be some scumball went to make a bomb threat ... they 'd pick up the phone like a decent human being . Now what ? They fax ' em in . - Scumball ? - Sort of like a miscreant , only different . [ Forced Laughing ] Someone mark the calendar . Lamont made a funny . Now , this bomber faxes his threats in . That 's a unique M.O. Must help him cover his tracks . Well , this guy doesn 't need any help . We have run ... every piece of evidence he 's left behind through the best technology we have : D.N.A. , hair samples , fiber , impressionology ... Guy leaves us nothing to follow . Nothing . We gotta catch a break sometime . So you , uh ... You people , you stay here and keep after this . I 'm gonna go lie to the press . [ Groans ] What 's the matter , Carlson ? You catch a little more steel last night ? Hey , Lamont , why don 't you be a good civil servant ? Get the two heroes some coffee . He loves me . Did you have another bomb go off on you before ? I got a little shrapnel in my shoulder during the war . Hero here 's the only guy refers to Grenada as a war . - I got the medals to prove it . - Come on . You know the only medals ... that count in your family are the ones your big brother won in ' Nam . I heard that you brought the last two of the Fax Bomber 's devices in intact . I got lucky . Hey . Don 't you worry about it , J. One day this Fax Bomber 's gonna slip up . When he does , we 're gonna be there to catch him . I just hope the S.O.B. blows himself up . [ Man ] The detonator was connected to an accelerator . This is a dangerous new escalation for the Fax Bomber . Hand those out , will you , John ? This is my sight profile of the bomber . It includes a , uh , computer-generated composite sketch ... based on some incomplete information . - He looks like my Uncle Fred . - Looks like everyone 's Uncle Fred . Based on his , uh , faxed threats and other data ... the bomber is a left-handed , disgruntled ex-city worker . The chances are he 's already expressed his discontent . - We all know what that means . - Back to the crank files . Excellent , Lamont . Now , I expect ... that all of you people will put in whatever overtime is necessary ... to screen those files and to interview every possible perp . Questions ? No ? Good . Go to work . - Excuse me . Lieutenant Chomsky , do you have a moment ? - Sure . I 've been going over your file on the fax bomber , and with all due respect , sir ... You know , when people say , " all due respect , " they generally don 't have it . Sir , it-it 's just that I think that your profile of the perp ... is exactly who he wants us to think he is . I think that his grudge against the city and everything else about him is a mislead . Guy 's here a week , he 's already bucking for my bars . No , sir . I just happen to have a different opinion . - Based on what ? - I know people . I 'm listening . The D.N.A. and the impressionology ... all came up empty . He 's trying to lead us down a high-tech path ... but I believe that we can snag him with a low-tech solution . He 's right-handed ... but he wants us to believe he 's a lefty . The verticals and the horizontals are all jagged ... which would indicate that he 's been writing with his subdominant hand . - You 're a graphologist ? - Uh , no , sir , but I was a palm reader once . Shall I tell you about your future here ? Sir , I believe that our bomber ... is a city employee who is not necessarily disgruntled . He 's enjoying watching us run around ... almost as much as he enjoys setting off explosions . If you want to suggest that , uh , this clown is some kind of a Merry Prankster ... I recommend that you talk with Rachel Newton . Rachel is gonna spend the next year of her life ... learning how to read Braille because of the Fax Bomber . - I wasn 't trying to trivialize that , sir . - No , no . I know you weren 't . You were just trying to make , uh , an impression ... show off your erudite European upbringing . - My what ? - The cadence in your voice ... You were raised by a French nanny . Well , could be Belgian , I suppose . - How did you know that ? - Oh , I know about people too . [ Sydney Speaking Foreign Language ] [ Continues ] [ Miss Parker ] Damn it , Broots . You said we had him cornered . But we did . I don 't know what happened . - Jarod happened . - Oh , spare me , Sydney . All I know is that I 'm fed up ... with always being a step behind him . [ Raines ] So am I. - Uh , l-I gotta go . - Stay here , Mr. Broots . - What brings you down from the Tower , sir ? - Plumbing . Plumbing ? I 've come to plug a leak . - Hey . - Hey . What 's up , Nobel ? The Fax Bomber , a.k.a. Uncle Fred . Okay . Not my finest hour , but , hey ... nobody got a great look at this guy , so the sketch is , you know , sketchy . This is a fascinating machine . Yeah . This here is a Decatronics Turbo Graphics II workstation . This little bad boy makes composites , puts disguises on portraits ... ages missing kids , which is what I 'm doing now . - That 's incredible . - Some of my best work 's been on the backs of milk cartons . [ Chuckling ] Think of the D. T.G. II ... as sort of a high-tech Mr. Potato Head . - Mister who ? - Potato Head . Oh . Now , this is interesting . You call him Mr. Potato Head , yet his head is his whole body ? Yeah . Cool , huh ? He comes with little interchangeable ears ... eyes and little hats . Old Spud Man is the original master of disguise . You know , this would make a wonderful toy for children . Hey , Nobel , crank file just turned up a hot one . Let 's run . - Hmm . - [ Doorbell Ringing ] Oh , God . What 'd he do ? Curtis ! They finally came to arrest you ! - Curtis ! - Busy , Ma . ! Mrs. Haring , we 're not here to arrest your son . I knew someday the cops would show up and take him away . - Curtis . ! - I said , get off my back . ! - Ma 'am , we just wanted to ... - Thirty years old , and he still lives in my basement . Day in and day out , writing his little letters . I should 've bought stock in Bic . Don 't say nothing , Ma . This is all going on tape somewhere . I know it . Listen to that . Do you know what it 's done to my social life ... having him down there ? - You 're not gettin ' nothin ' out of me . - I 'm in the prime of my life . I should go out , get myself some nice shoes and find myself a man . - Ma ! - Sir ... did you write these letters to the utilities commission ? And I 'll write a hundred more till they give me back my workman 's comp . I got an inoperable hernia working for this city ... and they threw me to the wolves . How 'd you get that letter ? What 's your name ? I 'm Carlson . This is , uh , Nobel . Hold still , man . I can 't see your badge number . He don 't have no hernia . Hejust don 't wanna move out of the basement . Shut up , Ma ! You know how my legs tingle every time I sit for too long . Yeah , and I know where you 're sittin ' ! Sir , we 're not here to talk about your workman 's comp . We want to ask you some questions about your whereabouts . Hey , if you think you got something on me , you come back with a warrant . Till then , me and my mother 's got nothing to say to you miscreants . I should 've married a dentist . - At least then his teeth 'd be better . - Ma ! This guy 's classic bomber material . Former city worker , domineering mother ... basement workshop , a little antisocial behavior . - I 'm not convinced . - Huh ? He 's written 253 letters to the city and counting . If he 's crossed the threshold into planting bombs ... don 't you think he would have given up the correspondence ? - Did you notice what he called us in there ? - Miscreants . - Right . Nobody uses that word except for that guy and ... - The Fax Bomber . I 'm gonna get under this guy 's skin before he hurts someone else . [ Electronic Squawking ] Wake up ! Wake up ! Good morning ! ... five , six ... seven , eight ... nine , ten ... - You can stop counting . You 're here . - Oh . [ Chuckles ] You must have stepped into the room . It 's 11 steps to the door . I did . That 's very good . It 's funny , Dr. Jarod . I used to hate math in school . Now my entire life is basic arithmetic . Nine steps from my bed to the bathroom ... 14 steps to the hallway , seven steps to the chair . Just be happy it 's not long division . It 's a beautiful day . Why don 't we go outside ? Oh , no. I ... l-I think I 'd rather stay here . Rachel ... you have to go outside sometime . I was supposed to work in my studio ... but it was such a nice day , I decided to go on the rooftop at city hall . That 's what happened the last time I went outside . You were in the wrong place at the wrong time . But that is not your fault . You can 't stop living your life because of it . I hear he set off another bomb . Yes , he did . Thankfully , nobody else was hurt . You know , when I had my eyes behind a camera ... I could see things no one else could see . I could take a thousand shots ... and tell you which one was peryect before it was even developed . I can remember details of nearly every picture I ever took . That 's ironic . They tell me he was there that day . That I must have seen the man who did this to me as he was setting his bomb . But as hard I try , I can 't remember . I can 't believe they think one of us ... is leaking information toJarod . [ Sighs ] Oh , I wish I hadn 't eaten that poppy seed muffin . They 're giving us a polygraph , you idiot ... not a urine test . I thought it was both . It should be , for you . What-What is that supposed to mean ? You 're the one who handles the information around here . I 'm sorry . I 'm in a filthy mood . Let 's not accuse each other . Oh , that means a lot coming from Jarod 's teddy bear . Miss Parker . To calibrate the machine ... please answer the following question untruthfully . - Are you Eleanor Roosevelt ? - Yes . Have you pursued Jarod to the best of your ability ? - Yes . - [ Raines ] Become her , Angelo . Tell me if she is lying . [ Man ] Did you willfully misfire your weapon ... when attempting to apprehend Jarod in Miami , Florida ? - What ? - Yes or no , please . No . Smoking is not permitted during a polygraph . Have you received ... a personal message from Jarod ? It was a bunny . Yes . Did you secretly contactJarod via a secure Internet connection ? Yes . Did you attempt to provide him with classified information ? Yes , but with a view to bringing him home . - Have you ever secretly met with Jarod ? - Mm-mmm . No . Is he lying ? Is he the one ? Have you ever used a controlled substance ? [ Clears Throat ] No . Were you in the lab when information regarding Jarod 's origins was leaked ? Yes . Did you leak the information Jarod received ... - via special courier in Miami , Florida ? - No . - Have you ever lied to the Centre ? - No . [ Gasping ] He 's the leak , isn 't he , Angelo ? So , you 've decided to put in a transfer to Forensics , hmm ? I 've just been sifting though all the Fax Bomber debris . You went over three thousand pieces of evidence here ? Three thousand and twenty-five . - I 've specifically been studying the wires . - No , no , no . The feds , they covered every centimeter of that copper . I know . I 've been studying the encasements . There 's no pattern . This guy is random ... except for the detonator connectors . He 's very sensitive about them . He wants to be sure . That 's why they all have exactly the same parallel cut pattern . Come on . Exactly the same ? Exactly . Notice the angle of the grooves on the parallels . Gives us something to run down with the knife manufacturers . - And the cut contours confirm that he 's ... - Right-handed . Yes , sir . Low-tech . - Very . - Mmm . - Hello . - Hey . Hey . How 's the spud of a thousand faces ? Well , I only have the 13-piece set so ... technically , this one 's only got , uh ... One hundred and seventy-nine . I have a project for you . I 'm up to my ears in milk cartons here . Well , this one 's very special to me . It 's my mother . I was wondering ... if you could age her 30 years . - I want to see what she would look like . - [ Pager Beeping ] - I 'll make it worth your while . - Hey , I 'll see what I can do . - Thanks . - All right . [ Siren Wailing ] It 's right over there under the bus . It 's right over there under the bus . - Did the threat come in by fax ? - It was more of a phone call . One of my drivers found the unclaimed suitcase on the 3 : 15 from Traverse City . - All right . We 'll take it from here . - Thanks . Hey , can you guys kinda hurry up ? 'Cause I got buses backing up on me here , man , and I ... Take as much time as you need then . Thanks . - You okay ? - Yeah . Come on . [ Buzzing ] [ Horn Honks ] Got a backache ? [ Switches Off ] They told me we would have a lot ofhoax calls in training ... but I never thought it would feel like this . - Let go , J. - That 's easy for you to say . - It was pretty tense back there . - Don 't worry about it . - That 's nice work . - Oh . Yeah . - From my army days . - Let me guess . - You got drunk one night . - Blitzed . [ Chuckles ] My whole unit . After Grenada , they stationed us down at Fort Buchanan , Puerto Rico . I do not remember one thing that happened that entire month ... except for this needle artist . He was a shriveled-up little Puerto Rican guy ... who had a hole-in-the-wall shop in old San Juan . - He inked every single guy in the whole platoon ... - The whole platoon . You know how many eagles this guy had to do in one night ? Give us a break , will you , Carlson ? You partner with this guy too long , you know his old unit like it was your own family . [ Rachel ] What are you doing ? I 'm going to turn this space into a darkroom . - I live in a darkroom . - Good . Because I need you ... to develop a roll of film for me . Oh , that smells familiar . - I thought you 'd remember it . - Is this some kind of new therapy ? Call it a simulation . - Simulation ? - Mm-hmm . I 'm going to create an environment ... with all the stimuli you need to recreate an event ... and for you to become someone . Who do you want me to become ? - Yourself . - Oh ! Oh , my camera . Oh , I haven 't touched this since the ... well , since the day at city hall . Now I want you to develop that roll of film ... the pictures you took that day . - Oh , but there 's no film in it . - I know . I want you to develop the pictures in your mind . I 'm on the rooftop at city hall . Natural light is at its - its peryect angle . The building is ... is closed . It 's Sunday . And I 'm , uh , getting last-minute shots for my gallery opening . [ Jarod ] Are you alone ? I think . l-I don 't see anyone . I don 't ... I don 't see anyone ... but I feel a ... a tingle on the back of my neck . - [ Footsteps ] - I don 't see anyone , but I hear something . - What do you hear ? - Footsteps , walking quickly away . But , uh , you don 't think anything about it ... because you have other pictures to take . It 's right before it happens . We can stop this if you want . No . I walk over to where the footsteps are coming from ... but he 's gone . Rachel , do you see the bomb ? It 's only an instant before the flash . - Do you see him ? - No . But ... I smell something . - I smell ... - You smell him . It must be , um ... I don 't ... I don 't know what it is . It-It 's cologne . No , it-it 's , um , medicine , menthol . - What athletes put on sore muscles . - Liquid heat . Thank you . - Are you Steven Johnson ? - Yeah . Special Agent Jarod Webster . F.B.I. ? What did I do ? Nothing , Mr. Johnson . I 'm just doing a security check ... on one of your old army buddies , Daniel Carlson . He put you down as a reference . If you want to clear Carlson , you 're talking to the wrong guy . - Why 's that ? - Carlson talks a good game ... but the rest of the squad had to carry him every step of the way . Well , the way he puts it , you were a very tight unit . We 'd probably have shot him ourselves if he hadn 't caught the shrapnel in the shoulder . He has the company tattoo on his forearm . You don 't see any moronic little birds on me , do you ? Hell , Carlson come in one day all drunk ... queer little bird on his arm , talking about how he wanted the rest of us to get ' em . Guy 's a dangerous little wannabe . Well , thank you very much for your time . Hey , what 's the little weasel applying for , anyway ? - Bomb Squad . - God help us all . - [ Siren Wailing ] - [ Jarod ] You paged me ? [ Man ] Oh , yeah , dude . Sorry Santa was a little late ... but , uh , " Ho , ho , ho . " She 's still beautiful . Now , um , you said you 'd make it worth my while . Patience , Mr. Potato Head . - Thank you . - Okay . Jarod , the Fax Bomber just blew himself up . - Where 's Carlson ? - He phoned it in . [ Sirens Wailing ] Let me through . ! Let me through . ! Let her through . This is her house . This is her son . Let her through . Are you hurt ? I wasn 't home last night . I had a date . Curtis ? Curtis , Mama 's here . Ma 's here , honey . I had a feeling about this guy . I came over here to see if I could get him to talk . He must have seem me coming because the whole place went up . - It knocked me all the way back to the end of the driveway . - It was a nice play , Carlson . - Get yourself cleaned up . You look like hell . - Thank you , sir . I should have known it was him . Another croissant , Miss Parker ? Cold coffee 's plenty . He always seemed to be ... a step ahead ... and then suddenly , we were a step behind . Broots has the classic nonconfrontational personality . I doubt he would put himself in harm 's way . [ Car Engine Starts ] [ Miss Parker ] Where the hell is he going now ? Private investigator ? Could he have found Jarod ? I don 't know . But somebody just put themselves in harm 's way . It doesn 't make sense . The same bomber , who was so intelligent he didn 't leave ... as much as a speck of D.N.A. behind , accidentally blows up his own mother 's house ? - Don 't start with me , Nobel . - And why would he keep all of his bomb-making equipment ... in a box in the garage when he had his own basement workshop ? - Maybe he was feeling the heat and was planning to make a move . - I don 't think he 's our man . Why ? Is he left-handed ? As a matter of fact , he is . The issue of guilt is up to a jury . Our job ... collect evidence . [ Alarm Chirps ] [ Man ] Now we have an exclusive with Officer Dan Carlson of the city Bomb Squad . So , you defused his devices and brought him to justice . How does it feel to be the man who uncovered the Fax Bomber ? I 'm just glad this nightmare for the city is finally coming to an end . Not quite . - Here . - [ Gun Cocks ] What do you ... What is this ? What are you doing ? Sweepers ? In my house ? - [ Crying ] - That 's all right . That 's okay . It 's all right . He 's in the middle of the custody battle . The P.I. was trying to dig up something on the ex he could use in court . - The plane ticket ? - Time for little Susie to fly home to Mommy . At least we 've cleared him . Cleared him ? He lied to the Centre . - He never said anything about being married . - He wanted his privacy . - None of that justifies what we did . - You 're damn right . You 're late . Well , I spent all morning on the phone with a lawyer . He dropped my case . Hmm . I 'm sorry to hear that . Mmm . Are you , Miss Parker ? Thanks to you , my daughter hasn 't stopped crying since last night . Tomorrow , I have to send her back to her mother , which is a place she doesn 't want to go . None of that has anything to do with the Centre . I work here . I sold my soul to be in this place . I 'm not selling her . So don 't mess with her . And don 't mess with me . Hey , Lamont , what are you doing tonight ? - Hey , Carlson . - What ? You 'd better take a look at this . What ? Ugh . This is some kind of hoax . Now , we know the-the Fax Bomber is in a hospital bed . Well , I guess he checked himself out . Let 's go . - Main elevator banks . - Right over there . - Come on ! - Maybe we should wait for backup . And miss our chance to be heroes ? Come on . Whoa . Another Bad Betty . Oh , God . Let 's not rush into anything here . Oh , look . He left a note . Careful . Slow . " This time it 's real . " Hmm . See ? - No ! - [ Bell Dings ] Forget it , Carlson . This is the express . It won 't stop for 60 floors . Oh-oh . Sixty floors if we 're lucky . - What are you talking about ? - Barometric detonator . Designed to detonate at altitudes 600 or 700 feet . My guess is we 're good for 45 , 50 floors , tops . - We gotta get out of here ! - No , we 've gotta defuse this bomb . - No , there 's no time ! - Oh , there 's plenty of time . It should be easy for you . It 's just like all the other bombs you used to make . - Huh ? - You know ... the bombs you defused ... - so you could be a hero just like your big brother was ? - Who the hell are you ? Just your average , everyday miscreant . And someone who doesn 't think that Rachel Newton should have lost her eyesight ... so that you could be put in the limelight . Now , listen to meJarod . I did not expect anybody to get hurt . Tell that to Curtis Haring . He was the guy you tried to blow up ... so you could cover your tracks . All right ! That 's enough ! Now , come on ! Defuse this thing ! Not so cool under pressure when it 's not your own bomb . But you see , people that plant bombs , they 're cowards at heart . And since I planted this one , I don 't want to stick around to watch it blow . - [ Bell Dings ] - Uh-oh . Twentieth floor . Better get to work . Hope you can figure out which wire to snip . Bye-bye , hero . No ! Jarod ! Jarod ! [ Beeping ] [ Thudding ] I guess that 's why they call it the express . [ Rapid Beeping ] [ Electronic Male Voice ] Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six ... five , four ... three , two ... one . Kaboom . You 're under arrest , Carlson . [ Curtis ] ... that all of you at city hall ... will pay egregiously for what has happened to me . - Are you sure you want to say that ? - Say what ? - " Egregiously " ? - Who 's writing this letter ? - I was only making a suggestion . - It 's my letter ! - All right , already . What do you want from me ? - Ma ! - You don 't even know what it means . - Do too ! - Well , I can spell it . - Just write it ! - E , G , R ... - Get my dictionary . ! - I 'm not going in that smelly basement . - Ohh ! There 's a fly on me . - " Egregiously . " - A fly on me ! Aah ! - [ Knocking ] - [ Jarod ] Morning , May . - Where 's Rachel ? - There 's something you should see . Took her about a halfhour to get down there . But she got there all by herself . He 's still searching , Mr. Parker . But we will find the leak . I promise you that . Did you find something , Angelo ? Keep working . Keep working .

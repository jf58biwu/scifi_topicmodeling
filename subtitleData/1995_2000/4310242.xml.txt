 ( " RED DWARF " THEME ) - What is that thing ? - Astroglacier . Allotropically modified , surrounded by an envelope of luminous gasses . Thanks ! That 's most helpful . - What is it ? - To you , a big iceberg . I studied them in the Corps , but I 've never seen one up close . Isn 't it incredible ? Look at those crystalline formations . They 're faberoo ! You think sciencey stuff 's really interesting , don 't you ? I bet at school you always had the right pencils and impossibly neat handwriting . I bet you can tell us the average rainfall of the oil-rich lowlands of Venezuela . No , I couldn 't . I 've no idea . OK , 3.4 inches . So what ? Unlike you , my greatest accomplishment isn 't a line on a loo wall marking my highest-ever pee . I 'll have you know , ma 'am , I too possess qualifications . What qualifications have you got , meat-tenderiser-head ? I 'm a fully qualified Bachelor of Sanitation . You may not know this , sir , but I completed my course at Toilet University , where I studied the lavatorial sciences . Toilet University 's a piece of software , part of your core program . I had a written examination to indicate the program was successfully installed . It was most interesting . Did you know that the first siphon and valve flushing system was patented in 1778 by Joseph Bramah , whose U-bend curvature equations are still ... - Kryten . - Yes , sir ? Can this story maybe wait ? Ideally , until after I 'm dead . Speaking personally , I hardly didn 't get no formal education at all . - No kidding , Professor . - No , it 's true , bud . That 's why sometimes I don 't know stuff , like ... well , practically everything . - Is it because you brought yourself up , sir ? - Right . I had to teach myself . And as I didn 't know anything to begin with , lessons were long and slow , especially on Thursdays when I had double nothing . So what do we do about the ice ? Well , water supplies are low , ma 'am . If the ice is uncontaminated , it might prove useful . - OK , standard SEP scan and log . - Locking on . Scanning and logging . Extraordinary . - What is it ? - Something 's buried in the astroglacier . Some kind of object . It 's huge . Just processing . - Well ? - It 's a starship . This place is harder to get into than an airline chicken Kiev ! It 's the Leviathan , sir , a 23rd-century JMC supply ship . Engines are dead , power overload . Looks like they were running from something . Wait ! I 'm picking up a life sign . - Are you absolutely sure ? - Certain . I 've never seen anything like this ! You weren 't around for my last party , were you ? Look at their twisted , tortured faces ! The sheer blind terror . - ( SCREAMS ) Oh , my God ! - What is it ? ! The back of my neck ! Great big gob of ice water ! It was horrible ! Went right down into my crevice . Hey , guys , check this out ! There 's a woman in there ! Just locating her JMC ident chip . Caroline Carmen . According to the psi-scan , she was once a supply officer on Red Dwarf . I remember her . She got reposted at Titan . - You knew her ? - She fancied me . I don 't believe you . A supply officer and you ? She did , actually . In fact , me and Karen had a thing going there for a long time . Caroline . Caroline , yeah . Karen 's my pet name for her . - I don 't believe a word . - Caroline Carmen and me , believe it . Sexually , we were just so compatible . While I was dating her , the women in the quarters next door called her Carmen Moans . - You could ask her if she was alive . - She is , sir . The life sign is coming from this very spot . Is it ? Well , she might not remember me immediately . She might have amnesia . - Amnesia ? - Yeah , ice does that . Gives you amnesia . - Right , Kryts ? - I don 't recall hearing that , sir . See ? It 's affecting him already . OK , let 's get her back to the Bug . I 've begun water siphoning from the Leviathan . Any change here ? No , bud . The ice won 't melt , and this room 's hotter than English beer . He 's right . The temperature 's been a constant 90 degrees , and yet she 's still completely cold and unresponsive . What about Miss Carmen ? I was talking about Miss Carmen . It 's as if the body 's generating the ice as protection . Maybe we should just laser it ? Recommend we wait until chemical analysis is completed in the morning , sir . Hasty lasering could result in damage to the body . Do you really think she 's still alive ? She must be . Ah ... Well , well , well ... This is a bit of a turn-up . You just couldn 't stay away , could you ? Hey , what are you doing ? ( LAUGHS ) And what makes you so sure I 'm interested ? You think you can just jump in my bed and I 'm yours ? Well , as it happens , you 're right , but it was a close thing . Mmm . It 's good to feel your sweet breath on my neck again . Smeg ! It 's Kryten ! It 's Kryten ! Quick ! Quick ! In the shower ! In the shower ! ( GROANS ) Smeg ! - Yeah . - Are you alone , sir ? - Yeah . - I just thought I 'd dust your quarters . - It 's two o 'clock in the morning ! - This is an emergency dust , sir . My sensors have picked up vast quantities of dust in this region . - I 'll take the risk , man ! - I can 't allow that , sir . Ah , double bed mode . Hmm ... I 'll just , ahem , dust inside your wardrobe ... Under your spare bunk duvet ... Hmm ... In your other wardrobe ... Kryten , man , I 'm trying to get some kip ! - She 's here , isn 't she ? - I don 't know what you mean . ( SQUEALS ) You promised you wouldn 't like her more than me ! Kryten , listen , um ... - Look , it 's like ... - It 's because she 's got a better head . Not again , man . No ! No ! - It is ! - I like your head ! - Not as much as hers ! - What ? You 've got a great head . It 's attractive , it 's functional , it 's almost perfect for carving a Sunday roast ! She 's in the shower , isn 't she ? Isn 't she ? - Who ? - Miss Kochanski ! Who else ? Madam Curie ? ! What is all this noise about ? I can 't sleep ! Forgive me , sir . Shame mode . Excuse me , ma 'am . How the hell did you do that ? Of course ! You slipped out through the vent shaft . Brilliant ! - What ? - You 're a genius , an absolute genius ! - What are you doing ? - Unbuttoning your shirt . - Why ? - We 've got some unfinished business ! That was a long time ago . Things are different ! Look , he 's gone . Don 't worry about Kryten . Get your kit off . I 'll find my Batman outfit . You really believe in being direct , don 't you ? Come on , rumpy-pumpy , Kris . Let 's hit the springs ! That 's your idea of seduction , is it ? Not if you were the last man alive . - I am the last man alive . - I rest my case . What did I do wrong ? What ? Oh , duvet ... Oh , my God ! Caroline ! You 've really let yourself go . You 're like the before bit for about 900 Clearasil commercials ! Sorry ! God ! Ah ! God ! God ! Are you all right , sir ? I 've just been molested by Tutankhamun 's horny grandma ! Of course I 'm not smeggin ' all right ! Eurgh ! The taste ! I need to gargle with a Toilet Duck ! She 's dead , sir . And , curious , it appears she 's been dead for three million years . If she 's been dead for three million years , where did the life signs come from ? Good point , sir . And more to the point , where did they go ? ( THUD ) - I feel really lousy . - Probably just shock . Don 't be a baby . Miss Kochanski , ma 'am , your bedside manner leaves something to be desired . - Like what ? - Well , like a bedside manner ! You think I 'm a hypochondriac ? You 're a man , aren 't you ? You get the common cold and you think it 's malaria . And women , of course , are different ? They just have a different perspective on pain , Kryten . As would you if you had to pour hot wax on your crotch and rip out half your thatch . He 's right . I hate doing that . - The tests are complete . - ( LISTER ) And ? There 's a foreign substance in your blood , and , well , I recognise the DNA , sir . - Is that good or bad ? - It 's the Epideme virus , sir . A man-made parasite created as a rival to the nicotine patch . Epideme was an intelligent organism , designed to block neural signals of nicotine craving , but it also blocked the signals telling the body it needed blood and oxygen . Is that why the Carmen chick looked like a centrefold from " Playzombie " ? Precisely . It 's virtually unstoppable . For the first 48 hours , it consumes its host , then hijacks the corpse and looks for a new victim . When it can 't find one , it freezes the body and waits . - So the life signs on the Leviathan ... - Didn 't belong to Carmen , but to the parasite inhabiting her body ... which passed to you the moment she ... well ... Slipped her mouth-meat down me gullet ? I 've been tongue-hockeyed to death ! In 48 hours , I 'll be deader than Saturday night in Salt Lake City ! There is one option , sir . I believe you might have a chance if you , well ... reason with it . - Reason with what ? - The virus , sir . It is intelligent . Are your neural circuits picking up interference from the tumble-drier again ? If we patch in the universal translator , it might be possible to talk to it . It 's your only chance , sir . It 's a long shot , but if we can reason with it , we might persuade it to leave . - Remember , be charming . - Be charming to my virus . Right . - Patching in the UT . - A great big " hi " to all of you out thereI Tonight , Dave Lister , vending machine sub-operative and spice food connoisseur , this is your deathI - Your line . - We 're speaking with the Epideme virus ? Give that man an eyebrowI Hey , I 'm feeling generous . Give him twoI Maybe we should , um ... Can I ... ? Dave , let 's run down the rules . If you win , you live . If I win , you die - I take all your knowledge , when I kill you . You absorb knowledge from every person you kill ? So killing you ain 't exactly a career highlight . As a virus , there 's not much call for knowing how to open a bottle with your anus . How can you justify killing another living being ? How about that chicken you biryanied last night ? How can you justify killing that ? Me and the chicken , it was different . How 's that , David ? Well , I 'm a person . It was a curry . He died so you could go on living . Is that so different from what I 'm doing ? Of course it is ! Totally ! I 'm a human being . I have certain qualities that elevate me above poultry ! - I can think . I can play the guitar . - Better than a chicken ? Are you crazy ? We 're losing , sir ! You better move on to another subject . I 'm the last guy alive ! - That gives you more right to exist than me ? - Well , yeah , because ... Time for your species to check out , Davey . Arrivederci , humiesI Oh ! David , come on . You 've got a virus . It 's fatal . It happens . Doesn 't mean we can 't be friends . Don 't touch that dialI Sir , you know how you told us to work on a solution , no matter how drastic ? - What have you got , Kryts ? - A solution , but , er ... - What ? - It 's too drastic . - Tell . - Well , what we thought was ... - You see ... - We want to cut off your arm . - What ? ! - I said it was a stupid idea ! - It was your idea ! - Are you saying I 'm stupid ? It 's our only chance to save you . It could be worse . - I could be planning a career in archery ? - You could be dead . You said you 'd consider anything . This is it . Can I have some details ? Something more inspiring than " Can I hack off your limb ? " The plan is to inject anti-virals through your body , forcing Epideme into your arm . And then you cut it off . Great plan ( ! ) What choice have I got ? OK , but make it my left arm , OK ? ' Cause my right arm does all my favourite things . - OK , sir . - Let 's go ! Chop-chop ! Sorry . ( WHIZZING ) Injecting anti-virals . OK , virus heading north . Grid coordinate 109.4 . - The pancreas . - 104.2 , on my mark . Mark . And heading for the left shoulder , 309.0 . No , no , no , no ! 308 ! 308 ! It 's heading away from his left arm . 406.9 ... 406.8 ... 406.5 ... Virus heading into his right arm . The right arm ! It 's our only chance . Laser bone-saw , sir , quickly ! Amputation mode - cut and cauterise ! ( HISSES ) It 's not enough . Still not enough . Still not enough ! Still not enough . OK , that 's enough . If this doesn 't work , we 're out of options . Whether it works or not , I 'll never touch barbecue wings again ! Aaah ! He 's awake ! My left arm ... My left arm , I said ! That 's my right . What kind of navigation officer can 't tell left from right ? We did our best . I am so sorry . - Where is it ? - We flushed it into space . We had to . Oh , my right arm . I did everything with that arm . We were inseparable ! At least , I thought we were . - Mr Lister , sir , you 're awake ! - Buddy , you look great ! Oh ... You did what you had to do to save my life . ( WHINES ) You haven 't saved my life . Seven per cent of Epideme 's virions have got back into your body . They 're currently multiplying exponentially . So , to sum up - all 's I 've got to look forward to now is death , zombification and a quick after-death snog with you or the Cat ? I 've given my arm - my arm - for nothing ? Not nothing , sir ! Based on my calculations , it 's bought you approximately 58 minutes more life . - What am I gonna do with 58 minutes ? - Have half a juggling lesson ? You 're really not helping . Kryten , he doesn 't like them like that . Ma 'am , I 've been with Mr Lister for many years now . I don 't need some judy-come-lately advising me on his sleeping arrangements . In my dimension , I cohabited with him . I know what makes him happy in bed . So do I. A large packet of extra-spicy tortilla chips and a really good horror movie , preferably featuring kung-fu-fighting lady vampires . Hey ! Old five-fingers has checked out ! - Oh , my God ! You mean ... - No , not dead . Checked out . He 's gone . And about 40 pounds of Incinerex blasting plastic has gone missing . - You think there could be a connection ? - Come on ! - What are you doing ? - I 'm just popping down the corner shop . - Does anyone want anything ? - Sir , come back . There 's no point returning to the Leviathan . It 's the only way , Kryten . Get back over there , detonate this stuff and destroy all traces of the virus . - At least it won 't get to kill me . - Dave , close the airlock . - What you 're doing is insane . - She 's right . You 've screwed up the ping-pong tournament . You gonna mess up the yo-yo championships ? Dave , don 't ! If you go , I 'll never speak to you again as long as you ... Oh , my God ! Just how stupid am I ? - According to my calculations , ma 'am ... - Kryten , shut up ! Hey , baby , what 's this ? The Christmas special ? That 's right , man , yeah ! Look what I got you - 40 pounds of Incinerex . It 's macho , but it 's not you . Get what I 'm sayin ' ? Let 's set the timer for five minutes , shall we ? Er , Dave , hellooo ? ( KRYTEN ON RADIO ) Leviathan ? Come in , sir . Kryten , get Starbug away from hereI You 've got five minutes . Dave , listen to me . Dave - my Dave - had a saying ... Even the word " hopeless " has " hope " in it . Maybe you had to be there ? - What did that mean ? - You can 't give up ! I 'm dead already . Use your eyes . I look worse than the Grim Reaper 's passport photo . Give us more time . The medicomp might still find an antidote . There 's no point . Look , I haven 't made a will , but , Kris ... under my bunk ... I want you to have the collection of songs I wrote about you . - Collection ? - Well , three . There 's only two things that rhyme with " Kochanski " . I used " underpantski " twice . Kryten , to you I leave all my laundry . Hey , keep it clean for me , man . Oh , sir ... you 're too generous . Cat , you can have anything you want from my wardrobe . I can ? Great ! I need some hangers ! 60 seconds left , Epideme . Dave , your heart says blow but your brain says no . You 're no quitter . The crew of this ship searched for a solution right until the endl - They never gave up . - They didn 't ? Hell , noI They even overloaded their engines . So sad ... because they were so near . So near . They weren 't running FROM something but TO something . Son of a gun ! Kryten , man , change of plan ! Sir , I 've been meaning to ask , as you retain specialist knowledge from each of your victims , and as we have no gripe , I was wondering if you 'd fill in some gaps in my knowledge ? Sure . ShootI I 'm red hot in quantum mechanics , molecular biology and TV themes . Ask me anything . Very well . One thing I 've always wanted to know , who on earth was the fourth Marx brother ? Zippo . EasyI Ask me a hard one . - A hard one ? - A HAAAAAAAARD one ! Yeeeaah ! Very well . How could Starbug 's drive module be reconfigured to be made more efficient ? ( INHALES ) Re-route the pulse relays via conductors and transpose all prime numbers to the energy equation . ( EXHALES ) - And that would make Starbug more efficient ? - 300 per cent fasterI That 's all we needed to know . The Leviathan was heading for Delta 7 for the Epideme cure , but by the time we got there , I 'd be dead . Unless we could make the ship go faster . - And now we can . - Well , I 'll be a son-of-a-bacteriaI - How are we doing ? - Like a speeding bullet in a bat outta hell ! Going into orbit right now . Scanning surface ... - Oh , my God ! - What is it ? The planet . It 's been flamed . There 's nothing down there ! Not a building , not a plant ... Nothing . - You knew . - I had to make Dave think there was hope . The planet was flamed to get rid of me , but I 'd already left in a medical engineer , who then made a house call to the LeviathanI - How 's it going ? - Life signs almost gone , sir . And in tomorrow 's episode , Kris Kochanski has a nasty turn when Dave , her hilarious decomposing boyfriend , returns from the grave to infect her with a wacky but charismatic virus . Until then , goodnight . ( HUMS " GOD SAVE THE QUEEN " ) ( CACKLES ) OK , last roll of the dice . Dave , I 'm gonna stop your heart , OK ? - ( BOTH ) What ! ? - It 's the last chance to save you . OK ? You 'll stop Epideme killing me by killing me ? I 'll take that as a yes . Is he ... ? Dead ? Yes , ma 'am ! Careful , Miss Kochanski , don 't get too close to him ! ( EPIDEME CACKLES ) The Epideme virus has transferred to you ! It 's infected your hand ! The showbiz news today - as expected , the long-running virus Epideme has been renewed for another seasonI Wrong , bug-head ! You 're axed ! NoI NoI noi ( SCREAMS ) Oh , my God ! Did you see that ? ! She ... ! She ... ! Miss Kochanski , ma 'am ! What ... ? ! I mean , what ... ? ! Have you gone completely insane ? ! - Kryten ! - Huh ! It was Caroline Carmen 's . I injected it with blood and adrenaline . That really is quite extraordinary . I had you down as a bit of a madam , but I have to eat my words . I mean , you do annoy me in some ways ... MR LISTER ! ( MUTTERS HYSTERICALLY ) Clear ! Clear ! Clear ! ( COUGHS ) Ohh ... Whoa ... Where have I been ? For the last few minutes , sir , you 've been dead . - Wow ! - How did it feel ? Ever been to Swindon ? - What 's that for ? - For not staying dead ! Germs . # It 's cold outside , there 's no kind of atmosphere # I 'm all alone , more or less # Let me fly far away from here # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # I want to lie , shipwrecked and comatose # Drinking fresh mango juice # Goldfish shoals , nibbling at my toes # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun # Fun , fun , fun # In the sun , sun , sun #

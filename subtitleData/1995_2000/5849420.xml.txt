 Answer by noon tomorrow . Tick one box . He 's offered us ... the kingdoms of the world . That head is going to outrate every damned show we got . He can guarantee all our funding . Do it , Emma . Go for it . Does it include ... - The whole team . Yes ! - Except Blinda . He was one of them , OK ? Everything here tells me . Your budget will be maintained .

Don 't darling me , you jerk ! - But that 's what you are . To me , that 's what you are . My darling . If there 's anything worse than a dickhead , it 's a limp dickhead . Just get yourself outa here . Prontolo . Perhaps if you 'd let me try later ... or ... - Later ? It 's already climbing towards midnight , Bill . Yeah , but thats ... phoo ... Who cares about time ... ? How the hell do you think I stay so slender and svelte and sparky eyed as well as run a trillion-unidollar business at one and the same time ? Not by missing my beauty sleep , that 's for sure ! Well ... I don 't think myself as ... like ... a stud or a ... I 'm not macho ... I get all tangled up in my feelings ... Try . Try talk it through , Bill . And maybe ... Yes ... I just might begin to ... God damn and shit on it ! - Martina ... ? What ... ? A one emergency . Stay where you are ! NECESSARY INTERRUPTION : VITAL . NECESSARY INTERRUPTION : VITAL . We have contact ? You sure ? - Wow-ie . - We 're there , General . It 's seven a.m. Western Europe time , Ms Masdon , which must make it late enough at night for you . Get out of shot . Lie on the floor . Now ! Or behind the bed ! You 're on the call , Ms Masdon . Who are you ? And what are you doing i n my laboratories ? I am Inspector-General Challender and I ... The Challender ? Are you really Colin Challender ? - Certainly I am . Well , I 'm really glad to have a chance to speak with a man who almost single-handedly smashed a whole cell of rons ... I doubt whether you 'll be quite so glad when you hear what I have to say . OK . Give it to me straight . - Between one fifteen a.m. and three-forty-five a.m. this morning , our time , the Reality Or Nothing organization , dressed as police , raided your cryogenic lab A ... and only this lab ... sprayed `Reality Or Nothing on the living wall and escaped without injury or apprehension with the ... Eh , madam ... You have an intruder ! Keep your butt down , you dickhead ! It 's OK , General . It 's ... eh ... a new biochemical Experiment . I 'm trying to put some brains into a man 's arse . Forget it . You don 't seem to have succeeded as yet . But as long as you are all right ... - I 'm OK ! Shoot , for Christ 's sake . Stop coughing , Chief . - Sorry ... Please excuse me ... hooo ! The long and the short of it is , they 've taken the head . I 'm sorry . But it 's not in its biobox ! - The head ! My head ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! A million bucks for anyone who brings it back . Ten million bucks for anyone who brings it back and kills the fuckers who took it ! Is that a contract , ma 'am ? - You bet your life it is ! Signed and sealed ! Get back the head , General . Get it back . We 'll do out damnedest , Ms Masdon . I think the final entry into this room could only have been made by staff 's biobrace . That 's where I 'll start ... - The bastards ! I 'll soon find out which one of those who regularly work in this room is most vulnerable to pressure . And when I find that person , madam , I can assure you here and now ... That person will crack . Why aren 't you at your post ? - Sorry . My guts is like Vesuvius this morning ... and the two-guard roster doesn 't start until eight-thirty a.m. , ma 'am . Yeah , you shouldn 't leave your post ! It 's not safe there ! Well , if you don 't mind stepping in some fresh shit , lady ... What 's your unit ? What is your number ? FG170535 . Move of ... - WILL DO . Move alongside the car in front . The other blue and black . - WILL DO . Window . Blinda ! ... Yes , sir . - Guard lane . Check lane one . Guard two . Check lane two . - Yes , sir . It 's clear . I have a list of all personel . - What the ... ? What ... ? Jesus ... ! Yes , there was a RON raid last night . Chief , this is Dr Tony Watson my personal assistent in biogenic cryology . - Oh , I wondered exactly what I was . This is the first you know about any of this ? - Yes , it is . Holy Moseolo ! But what in God 's name have they ... - They 've taken the head , Tony . Do you mind , Professor ? - Sorry , I thought ... They 've what ? - You heard . But what in thundering blazolo would they want with a ... Oh , I see , yes . - What do you see , Doctor ? Ransom money . It must be . Must be ? Why ? Why must ? Professor . I don 't know to whom I ... - Why must be ? On , um ... on the principle of Occam 's Razor ... You cut away all the most impropable things and what you are left with is the bare-faced or , so to speak , probable answer . Something like that . Occam . Mmm . You refer to the antique monk , yes ? Yes . - All right , youngish man . Give me an improbable explanation for all this Improbable ? Oh , but ... Come . You said you had to cut away all the improbabilities in order to expose the probable . What did you cut away ? Oh , isn 't this rather ... Well , it 's a bit silly , surely ? Come , come . Humour me . Well ... it could be ... it could have been a protest ... a meaningless stupid protest about the way we treat our own species ... Um . Huh . Or it could equally well have been , um , a rival ... yes ! A commercial rival like Chemicure or ... or .. you know , seeing what we 're up to . Those sort of things . Did you ever want to be an actor , Dr Watson ? An actor ? W-what do you mean ? - Oh , now . What do I mean ? Surely you know what an actor is ? What an actor does ? Of course I do ! But why on earth should I want to be an actor ... ? Well . It was a wise choice , in any event . I 'm not sure whether to be pleased or offended by that ! My name is Challender by the way . Inspector-General Challender . I 'm Head of All-Corporate Security . So if it should turn out to be a case of inter-company rivalry , I should be considerably embarrassed . Do you think , then , that you are not a good actor ? I don 't think about it at all , thank you very much . Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . I 'm so sorry that all this should have been awaiting you . I 'm quite sure you have been as helpful as you intended to be . Chief . Chaps . I think we are done here for the present . This place has been finger printed , fluid printed , gene-laundered , odometered , hyrocycled . All in the wee small hours . So if you have any meaningful work left here . You and your staff may proceed with it unhindered . Forgive us our interruption . - Thank you , Inspector General . Not at all . One ... Two ... Three ! I 'm so sorry . But there 's just one other little thing Would you be kind enough to accompany us , Dr Watson ? Me ? I mean ... where to ? What for ? I would like to find out just how sharp an instrument Occam 's Razor might actually be . Come along , Doctor . Poor old Tony . He 's the least shifty character I 've ever met . There must be something about him that irritates . DON 'T TALK BUGGED ! MEET RELAX ROOM 15 MIN 'S - All that whatsname 's Razor stuff . Why does he do that ? Oh , they 'll soon see he 's a babe in the woods . Christ . Where do we start ... and what do we do ? There 's not much we can do . If they 've taken the head , those bastards , they 're sure to have damaged it beyond anything we can repair . And where the hell is Blinda ! Well , the bells are ringing for us , Daniel . I think they always will , Beth . I hope they always will . - I 'm ... I feel shy . Isn 't that silly ? So do I. And , no , it isn 't . Is that it ? Is that the best that you can do ? - I 'm afraid so . Alas , yes . Just when they where really about to get down to it ! Nice tits , too . Harry ! Do you have to be so fucking vulgar all the time ? OK , OK , so you 're in a bad mood . Don 't take it out on me . I am not experienced in the ratio of those new neuropeptides . That is not my particular field . You need that Slav fellow and the black woman ... and the old lady . But I would have thought you would have been pleased , Mr Stiltz . Pleased ! - We have shown that the head is capable of `working ' , so it has survived its ... um ... it 's ... - Kidnap . It has survived . And the very first time I stimulate the particular area of the neocortex , which is my field , Mr Stiltz , lo and behold you have given unto you a proud pair of knockers . I fail to see what is so devastatingly amusing when I choose to descend occasionally into what I believe is the vernacular . OK . OK . Enough . I 'm damaging something inside . I felt it go twang ! Oh ... OK ... We 'll have to wait for the real team ... A goldmine , Harry . We 're talking of a goose which 'll lay a golden egg whenever we want ! Yeah ... or a lot of feathers . - Just think of it ! Spilling out everything that 's locked away in there ! Who 'd want made-up stories from a bunch of lazy overpaid hacks when you can mainline into the real thing . This Daniel Feeld fella ... he is , Christolo ... he 's immortal . - Immoral too .. We hope . There is a good chance . It is a characteristic of the male species . What ? - We 'll plug that brain into everybody else 's ! What 's his is ours ! What he has tucked away , all his secrets , his behaviour , everything ... it 's ours . At last privacy has a true market value ! Zillions ! Harry ... Harry boy ... - Yes , massa . Haven 't we always tried to get inside people 's heads ? Isn 't that what this game is all about , showbiz and that part of it we call politics ? Owning people . But ... and this has been the drag ... we 've never been able to get right inside , to own the tiniest little fragment of the inside of a person 's head . Now we have the chance ! And David Sylvester Stiltz is just the man to do it . RELAX ROOM NO VID OR AUDPHONE . NO RECORDING DEVICES.GUARANTEED ARTICLE 16 SECTION 312 WESTEUROPA SUPREME COURT . 2349 . ... but what is even more interesting to me is that those cops didn 't wait for her to come . They tried all their sniff-sniff stuff with all of us , and Tony so stupidly fell for it . But , no , they weren 't interested in her . I 'm sure she 's a snoop for them . I 'd eliminate her if I had half the chance . And when does the killing stop ? When it has to . Luanda . What 's wrong ? There 's a hell of a kerfuffle going on down the corridor ... And it 's full of cops again . It seems Blinda 's turned up . What 's happened , Luanda ? - She 's dead . They found her in her bubble . Somebody 'd shot her in the head after she 'd given her journey instructions . My God . What is going on ? And what is Tony going to do ? Or to say ? I feel scared . I wish we 'd never gotten into any of this . Tony may be foolish , but I don 't think he 's a coward ... The silly boy . We 've got to get out of this place . Out of the whole Masdon thing . I don 't care what it looks like , but I 'm formally to resign . The sooner we can move to the ICB labs the better . God knows if that head will survive all this . It 's going to look bad . - I don 't care . Tony might crack at any moment anyway . We 're already under suspicion . I 've got nothing to lose now . And neither have you . OK , Karl . OK , OK , OK , OK ! Let the cheapskates go . Good fucking riddance , I say . Anyone in the biochemical business who is so stupid as to resign from Martina Matilda Masdon is taking a long walk without water out into the wilderness . Yes , ma 'am . Too damned right . The wilderness . Shhhh ... Ohh ... Oh , yeah . Fidelity . - Martina ? It 's a wonderful world for a wonderful wonderful concept Yes . It is . It really is . Be strong . Be strong . What will you do with him ? No one has laid a finger on him . No one has said a word to him . But he 's not made of much . He weeps at night , every night , and every afternoon he listens to our scream machine . And each time the door opens he wets himself . Poor creature . How long have you had him now ... six days , seven ? Six . we still have another eight under the Anti Terrorist Charter . But ... well ... he 's well and ready for you now , if you want him to eat out of your hand . Or any other equivalent . I 'll take your word . Ah ! Lovely smell . Lovely colour . That 's the cherries . Of which life is supposed to be a bowl of . That or a bowl of dog biscuit . Equally fine for a pair of cunning old hounds , eh ? Stand to attention ! Yes , sir . You got a visitor . Oh , I ... I ... didn 't know th ... - Did I say speak ? No sir . - Then shut your mouth . Sit down . - Yessir . Good evening , Dr Watson . Mr ... Mr Stiltz ... But ... But .. But what am I doing here ? Is that what you mean ? May I sit down ? - Oh .. um ... Yes , of course . You seem a bit edgy , boy . - Edgy ? You can say that again . These are not nice places . - No , they ... My God . There are some terrible screams here sometimes I can 't imagine what it is they are doing to the poor devil . But ... it ... plays on the nerves . And the worst thing is ... Why are you here ? - We 've only met via vidphone . But I liked your sense of humour when I introduced Dr Rawl , the sexologist . Oh . Him . Yes . - He 's part of the team . Yes . I didn 't mean to be rude . Listen . The guy makes me laugh , too . Jeezolo , I wouldn 't want him anywhere near my erectile tissue , if that 's what he calls it ! He should marry that Masdon cow . Wouldn 't they make a terrific couple ? But he is family . And that 's how I think of my team . Family . And as in the morning , bright as a cockerel of whatever it is in the morning sky , your Professor Porlock , Dr Glazunov and Dr Luanda Partington will be on the team , too . Oh , that 's nice . They escaped the Masdon clutches , then ? Not much she can do , is here ? Except scream green murder . Green for envy . Envy . Anyway , I 've been looking into things . And I want you on the side too . Oh , Christ . I wish . Oh , how I wish ! I 've been checking on you . Family . Friends . Right back to school . Every nook and cranny , and I 've prodded at every little pimple , blackhead or bogey . And there 's not enough dirt on you to grow a mustard seed . Thank you . - I can 't understand why they want to execute you . They what ? - Well , that 's what they always go for when they think they got one of the top rons . The big needle and no noise . You never hear much about it , but ... I know for a fact that that 's what they 're up to . Safety first , they call it . Hey , here . C 'mon . Sit down . Let 's deal here . D-deal ? - Sure . Please , tell me . What sort of deal ? What can I do ? I mean ... If there 's anything ... Anything at all ! Please , Mr Stiltz . I 'm your man . Hi ! I was looking at you when you came in and Ithought ... the kind of ... You 'd like a drink ? Please ? You where staring at me , weren 't you ? In that café place ? I ... yes . - And you followed me in here , didn 't ya ? Yes . I did . What do you want ? What are you plaing at ? Please , what is your name ? - Beth . What 's the matter ? And the man you were with , he was called Christopher , wasn 't he ? Christopher ? Yeah . But ... what 's that got to do with you ? You know him , or what ? Christopher . Chris . My twin . Me . You . Whatchewmean you ? - I ... I 'm a writer . I put words in other people 's mouths .. And at the moment , I ... oh my God ! My stomamach ! It 's all coming true in front of me . The reason I 'm ill.Sick. I 'm not fit for this world . I 'm ... worthless . Listen . I said I put words into people 's mouths . Well , now I want to but I can 't get them out of my own ... My brother , they let him come home for a trial week when he passed this degree ... his degree in physics , cryophysics ... Are you getting any of this ? Can you understand at all ? Hey . Steady on , Romeo . - He drove straight at her . Says he didn 't know she was there . But that 's what he said about the first one . The boy . Straight at her ! And he is me . And I am him . And I feel it ... him ... I feel in my bones I 'm not fit to ... I should be put away ! Put Away ! Somebody ! quick ! Children in Jesus , today has been a special day in our chapel because the band has marched through the streets carrying our banner ... Daniel ! Daniel ! Oh Dan ! It 's Daniel , not me . It 's Daniel , not Christopher ! Not me ! I didn 't do it ! - Give him some air ! Dan . Dan o 'butty ! Oh Dan ... What 's happened ... ? This has happened before . It comes at a particular trauma , and it follows a great deal of displaced memory and visual distortion ... And the distortion , the trauma is connected directly or inderectly with sexual activity . Yes ? Probably . - Dr Rawl . that scene mixed up his meeting with a girl who was at his deathbed with the girl he had been due to marry , and with a homosexual assault Daniel had ensured as a boy while alone with his dog in the woods . And with what seems to me to be a lot of self hatred ... or certainly a sense of unworthiness . He must have been difficult to know or to like if that 's what he felt about himself . And of course he was disguising his own condition from himself by the fact that he was a writer . - Precisely . Meaning ? - Well , he is then by nature more adept at what most of us do rather more awkwardly ... Make a shape out of our own lives , murmur comforting consoluaions about what we have or have not done ... rewrite the past , in effect . There 's quite a bit of material recorded by now . I haven 't seen all of it myself . Has Mr Stiltz got this stuff ? Tony , why are you so concerned about Stiltz 's interests ? Because he 's been fair to us . - Oh ... We owe him . - I don 't . Well , you should ! I mean , I just think that ... Fair 's fair . That 's all . - All the material recorded goes automatically to Stiltz . It 's in the contract . You needn 't worry about that . Worry instead about what he 's going to do with it . Excuse me , Professor . - Yes , Valerie . I took over ... whatwashername ... ? Blinda 's log ... and there 's a difference in footage between the amount of tape actually recorded and the amount entered each day in the log . Difference plus or minus ? - More was recorded than was entered . How very strange . - Much more ? And every day ? Nearly every day . And the differences varied between twenty-two seconds and one minute fifteen seconds . George , do you record the amount of time we are in the lab and the head is , so to speak , switched on ? - To the second . It 's also done automatically ... And they always match . Could someone else be coming in here after we 've gone ... and managing , somehow , to get the head to ... No . That 's utter nonsense . - Especially for such short periods of time . I mean , it is ... what ? A minute and fifteen seconds ? He did it himself . Oh , come on , that 's bloody cretolo ! - Cretolo , is it ? You think I 'm that stupid , do you ? - Hey . I wasn 't trying to be personal , or ... I am telling you what is the only logical deduction . We have always soothed ourselves with what I 'm beginning to think is an anodyne lie . Yes ? What lie , Fyodor ? - The lie ... that Daniel Feeld does not in any meaningful sense know that he is in this half dead , half alive state . The lie that his memories are to him in this condition as dreams are to a sleeper . The lie that Daniel Feeld has no volition . You mean , you mean that Daniel has been transmitting his memories when we ´ re not here , and he ´ s in that neutral , just ticking over state that ... he is in now . That ´ s exactly what I mean . Oh , the poor creature ... Valerie , what day was the first day where there was more tape than there was time recorded for making that tape ? Actually , it was day one . Very fist day . And how long is it ? The extra . - Thirty-two seconds . We want Lazarus Project , Daniel Feeld , Day One . Final thirty-two seconds . Punch it through quickly . - It might not be at the end , Could have been any time we weren 't here ... lunch , for instance . Could be . But this is the most likely . TAPE DAY ONE . DANIEL FEELD . FINAL 32 SECONDS . Better ? Eh ? Listen . No blog ... Daniel . Say it . Say it , old lad . No blog ... g ... gah . What ? No what ? Ben ! No biography ! But we saw that ... The extra footage must be from somewhere else . - Must it ? I don 't believe you 'll find those 32 seconds anywhere else on Day One Tape . I think he was deliberatly summoning up that memory again . And he cut it short , too . - Exactly . Now , correct me if I 'm wrong , but didn 't the memory we saw go up to the ... what did you call it , Luanda ? The out-of-body experience . Yes , It did . - The what ? He saw himself on his own deathbed , as though from the ceiling . That has also been known to happen during a particular energetic copulation . Has it ? - Oh , certainly . When enough energy has been spent , so to speak , the oxygen supply can get rather limited and what is then alleged to be the ectasy of ejaculation is at times accompanied by the out-of-body description associated with the narratives of those who have been brought back from the very point of dead . If I may say so , this is especially true in the descriptions subsequentily given by young ladies of their carnal activities , and more particularly when they experienced multiple orgasms . Have you ever found that to be so ? - Me ? Yeah ... Why aren 't you looking at me , Doctor ? The point is ... the point surely is ... that he choose to cut off the out-of-body experience and the tunnel experience in order to leave it precisely at his final two mortal words . No biography . We are his torturers . Of course I don 't want to interrupt Mr Stiltz unnecessarily . But if you could give him this message ... - Will do . Tell him Inspector-General Challender is on his way to the hotel via the Central Station , and that I will be there in about forty-five minutes if he could speak to me . Tell him it is sensitive . - Will do . Operation Lazarus sensitive . Repeat . Operation Lazarus sensitive . Will do . More . More . Yet more . I want to slither like an eel ! - Yes Mr President ! Yeah , atta girls ! It 's great stuff , isn 't it ? The pictures . Yes Mr President . - Turn me over . Inspector-General Challender would like to see you briefly in about forty-four minutes , Mr President . - Tell him to fuck off . I 've got the hag-hour coming up , with that batty old Professor . Certainly , sir . But he says its quote sensitive unquote . Still tell him to fuck off . Dealing with the dame is enough to spoil one evening .. Quote Operation Lazarus sensitive unquote , sir . Then tell him to fuck hurry up ! Come on girls . Get me sitting up . I 've got to see an old lady . And then another old lady . Who 'd be me ? Who 'd be me ? Well , it 's no worse than the relax room at the other place . And I suppose we can trust the no-bugging notices . Which is supposing a great deal . - Fyodor , you really are cynical . But you know that , don 't you ? - No , I don 't . At least , you know where you are with him , Emma . - Yes . Which is not always where you would wish to be . All I 'm saying ... No , listen , Emma ... all I 'm saying is that from now on , everything we do to or about that head has a moral dimension Which we too easily persuaded ourselves was not actually there I mean , it seems to me the one ... .......... which is the end justifys the means . No , Fyodor , that is not what I 'm saying at all . I 'm not justifying the unjustifiable . It 's simply , and I think fairly , that I want to be absolutely sure about this `volition ' business . And so do I. - Well , I am sure . I am absolutely sure . And I 'm sick to my stomach with the thought of it . Daniel Feeld must be put out of whatever misery we are inflicting upon him ... And I tell you this . If and when I get the chance , I 'm willing to do it myself . Destroy the head . - Destroy it ? Isn 't that right , Emma ? Emma ? - I agree with you , Fyodor . We should not allow us to become torturers ... Particularly in the name of mass entertainment ! But it should not be impossible for the three of us together to devise a very specific response test to establish for sure that , A , he has volition and B , he is aware of his own condition . Fair enough . I accept that . And I accept the need to release him from bondage if that really is what he is in . If Stiltz finds out , we 'll be hunted down for the rest of our given days . There will be nowhere to hide , you can be sure of that . Come on , don 't be so prissy piss-arse English ... It 's one of the oldest games known to mankind . And it 's good for the spirit , too . Fine . If you know what you 're doing . But I don 't ! Sharpens up your sense of perspective . Get the right angle on things . And ... maybe ... win a little on the sidolo , eh ? We have to wager ? We have to wager . But what 's a game if there is no winner ? Christ , just a hobby , that 's what . Hey , c 'mon . We 'll play for ... - Fifty . A hundred . - OK . But I get to start . You get to start . We at Central believe that one of your Lazarus team is a RON . Brown ball . I don 't want my team disturbed . This is a very , very delicate process . A team is a team is a team . A RON is a RON is a RON . To be eliminated . Who is it ? And what are you smiling about ? Nothing . Nothing . I simply have amiable features , Dave , old man . Who ? I don 't think you 'll be totally knocked of your horse . Glazunov . Fyodor Gazunov , the slav . - Evidence ? What is your fucking evidence ! Principally ... at fist , that is ... the notes given by our agent in the lab , Blinda . An accumulation of small details . Small details . Itsy-bitsy , eh ? Scraps . Little lumps of frog shit . Is that what you mean ? All pointing to something . And then this morning we recovered a scrap of paper from a man called Milton , who was a senior RON , which has the name Glazu .. G-L-A-Z-U ... the rest incomplete , but it tells us something . Glazudyen , Glazupoff , Glazukon . Shall I go on ? No . But it 's ... - Nobody disturbs my team . Got it ? I don 't care if he 's a fucking leper or a hermaphrodite , as long as he 's in my team . As you are . Tick one box . Yes . No . Yes . As I am . Thank you , no . I 'll stick to good , plain mineral water . No ice . Hey , come on . You never let your hair down , do you ? You know absolutely nothing about me , Mr Stiltz . So please don 't make such categorical statements . OK . OK . I won 't keep you long . We 've got some pretty damn good stuff coming out of my editors . When we launch this thing , it 's going to knock everyone 's head off . Rumours are already blowing up a storm for us , and if the first ... Audcall from Anthony Watson for you , Mr President . Want to take ? Not at the ... Why the hell not ? Sure ! We 're all colleagues , right ? How do you do , Tony ? - May I ask if you are alone , Mr Stiltz ? You may . And the answer is No . I 'm having a great time with a Dame . She 's a real flyer ! - Sorry , sir ... but there 's something you should know about . F - Y - E - O. - What 's that mean ? Lost you teeth , or what ? Um . For your ears only . Well , I shouldn 't think it would bother the lady I 'm with , Tony , but , Jeezolo , if you 're going to go all spooky on me I guess I 'd better hitch a lift to another room . Stay on hold . Excuse me , ma 'am . ... If and when I get the chance . I 'm willing to do it myself . Destroy the head . - Destroy it ? Isn 't that right ? Emma ? I wonder . 009896102 , Fyodor . I think they 're on to you . Get out now . Get out in case . Message ends . I 'm just getting into the tub , Dave . so this 'd better be good , I 'm not , repeat not , playing pool again . OK . Shoot . I made a mistake , Colin . You 're right . A RON is a RON is a RON . What 's the world coming to ! Go get him , Colin . And syringhe the bastard to death . Oh , brave new world . Messages ! Fyodor , John . I 'd like to arrange a meeting with you to discuss your equities . My advice is if you buy an extra tranche in Rothman bubble you 'll , A , make a small profit and B , qualify as a full voter in state elections because you will then have shares beyond the thirty-corporation equity barrier . Can you try Wednessday , six p.m. ? - No . Fyodor . I think they 're on to you .. ( 577 ) Get out now . Get out in case . Message ends . ( 578 ) FG 170535 . Return to the ICB laboratories . Registered . I see this whole project is under threat of sabotage ! The point I 'm trying to make , Mr Stiltz , if you would please stop screaming and shouting ... You stupid stupid stupid old cow ! Don 't tell me what to do ! The point is , that head may well be aware of it 's own condition . And if that is the case , Mr Stiltz , it 'll be a moral outrage for us to proceed further . For you to , yes ! You prim old bag ! You won 't get the fucking chance ! I 'll put a new team in by the time it takes you to widdle yourself ! Work can always wait , mate ! LET ME GO ! Please . Forgive us . Forgive me . Can you hear me ? Can you ? Is there any ... No . Of course you can 't . LET ME GO ! Take it .. - OK . - OK . Go ahead . They 've scrawled through Glazunov 's vehicle instructions . His bubble was told to go to the ICB laboratories . Let 's go ! Shit ! He knows . He 's barricaded . Switch on the address system and give me the lead . Fyodor Glazunov . We know you are in there , and you know you have no chance of escape . There is no need for violence . Come out now and you will be treated properly . Come out now , before it 's to late . Arsehole . He 's here , sir . He 's barricaded . That 's no problem to us , but I understand there are areas you want undamaged ... Listen . Fyodor . You 've got yourself in a jam , my boy . Now , I 'm here to help you . I know I can help you . All I want , and you have my guarantee on this , my personal guaaaaaaaaa ... Personal guarantee , Daniel . Daniel ! ... hush , hush , here comes the bogey man , Don 't let him come to close to you , He 'll catch you if he can ! Chris . Chris . He 's driving down the line and England scores a try !

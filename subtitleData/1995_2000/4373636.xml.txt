 [ Man ] Tonight we stand beneath a new heaven . After 150 years of calling out ... the silence of the universe assures us that life is unique . We are alone . You and I ... are among the first to bring life to the stars ... to this planet ... the farthest any human has ever ventured . I know there are those at home who say ... that we are here only as a status symbol . Others say that we are fortune hunters ... or that we 're running away . But I know we 're here because of faith - faith in each other , in a better world . The rocket fuel that brought us here can be burnt away ... but our belief in ourselves , in one another - in the future - never can be : Never will be . [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Ticking ] [ Growling ] [ Barks ] [ Man ] Aw , come on , Buzz . What is it ? - [ Barks ] - It 's okay , Buzz . It 's just a meteor shower .

You are go for launch . [ Alarm Blaring ] - [ Chattering ] - [ Man On P.A. , Indistinct ] Vesta Colony never ran this smooth . They 're still having problems . We lost communication with Vesta this morning . If I 'm this pumped by a test launch , I won 't need a rocket . Final countdown . I know . Most people don 't know if their dreams will ever come true . Ours is definitely nine hours and two minutes away . [ Woman On P.A. ] Attention , colonists Aprey , West , Celina , Brown ... Glick , Gonyaley , Hyan , Larly , Mannesis , and Gatharian ... report to Governor Overmeyer 's offiice immediately . [ Grunts ] [ Man ] Over there . ! Hey ! [ Chattering ] [ Groans ] [ Panting ] Check him . I knew it . A Tank . I smell ' em like an animal . I told the foreman not to hire him . Get him up . I had two uncles die ... in the A.I. War 'cause the Tanks wouldn 't fight . The InVitro platoons were dissolved when I was a kid . I had nothing to do with it . Then you 're even more worthless . I never asked to be born . Great . Then you can ask to die . Go on . Ask . Ask . [ Groans ] [ Sirens Wailing ] [ Man ] Hey , get off the car . - You gotta protect me . - What the hell are you doing ? - Get out ! Get out of there ! - Drop it ! He 's crazy , sir . He 's a Tank . [ Offiicer ] What 'd you do ? Go on , get out . You 're setting him off . Drop it . ! - He tried to hang me . - I said put it down . [ Offiicer # 2 ] Damn InVitros are all alike . " InVitros " ? Call him what he is-a Tank . [ Woman ] We 're told to report immediately ... and then they make us wait two hours ? The others didn 't have to wait . Good afternoon , sir . The launch simulation went perfect . We are still a go ? I know you are aware of the growing rights movement for InVitros ... those conceived and born in artificial gestation tanks . Sir , we have every right to support the InVitros . They 're human beings , sir , just like us only conceived from parents who never lived . Last evening the Tellus Board of Governors ... was issued a directive from the United States Senate . The launch will be scrapped ... unless ten InVitros are on board . Given the severe limitations on weight ... rations , and personnel capacity - Are you saying we 're being replaced ? It is my sincere regret to inform you ... that one of you ... will not be on board . - One of us ? - Nine colonists have been released . - Postpone the mission . - If we don 't go in six hours ... the forecasted wormhole passage to Tellus ... won 't be open for another 12 years . They 're not even trained . Send them on the next colony . The next colonial mission won 't be ready for five years . There are members of Congress who need to look good now . - We 'll both resign . - You have a commitment to execute vital assignments ... on this mission , duties which one of you could cover ... but for which no one else is trained . Not to mention the severe legal consequences ... of breaking your contract . Besides I know you both . It 's your dream to go to space . The dream was to go together . I 'm on record as saying this directive stinks . I fought it all the way . Rather than issuing an order ... I 'm allowing the two of you to decide who shall remain . There is , uh , an alternative for one of you . There is a possibility the Marine Corps Space Cavalry ... may be assigned duty as Colonial Sentries . You want us to bet our lives on a possibility ? We did everything you told us . We followed the rules . We gave the program everything we had . These InVitros didn 't train . These senators haven 't sacrificed . Why should we pay for a mistake they made before we were even born ? You 're letting them throw away our lives . We believed in you . Now the only thing you can believe in ... is each other . Please arrive at your decision by 2130 today . [ Door Opens , Closes ] [ Thunderclap ] They 're coming . The lights . [ Whimpering ] Shane , take care of them .

I never thought we 'd be saying good-bye to each other . Then let 's run away . To a life of what ? Because we broke our contract , no one would employ us . We 'd be indentured servants to the Colonial Program for 20 years . Did they keep their word to us ? The program was all I ever believed in . And now there 's nothing . You believed in equal rights for InVitros . Not at the expense of our rights . We 've trained , we 've sacrificed , we 've dreamed ... together . Well , maybe we have to find another dream . We can 't spend the last hours we have together as victims . We have to somehow take control . [ Man On P.A. ] Gantry 4 , complete final preparations . Gantry 4 , complete final preparations . [ P.A.

I am here to turn you slimy civilian cesspool parasites ... into United States Marine Corps space aviators ... invoking bowel-wrenching fear into the dark hearts of your enemies . - Why are you here ? - Sir , to find a direction , sir . - A direction ? Are you lost ? - Sir , I suffer from a sense of disconnection - - Answer the question . - Sir , yes , I am , sir . Well , do I look like a road map to you ? - Sir , no , sir . - I am a road map . I will lead and you will follow . I will teach and you will learn . When you leave my academy , you will be weapons - focused and full of purpose - hot rod rocket jocks of precision and strength ... tear-assing across the cosmos , hunting for heaven .

I 'll bet it was your Marine Corps battle cry . - Let me hear your battle cry . - Aaah ! I am not impressed . Sergeant , demonstrate a Marine Corps battle cry for this pantywaist . [ Both Yelling ] [ Yells ] Still pathetic . In space , no one can hear you scream ... unless it is the battle cry of the United States Marines . Why did you join my precious Marine Corps ? - Sir , to defend my country , sir . - To defend your country from what ? We have no enemies . Are you crazy ? - I think you made a horrible mistake . - Sir , no , sir . - Are you calling me a liar ? - Sir , the best way to maintain peace ... is to maintain a good defense , sir .

Quickly , a few million years ... the sun radiates all of its potential power . The star swells . Mercury , Venus , the Earth disappear ... swallowed . The sun truly , finally touches the sky . Life vanishes eons ago . Eventually , the sun shrinks ... decreasing to the siye of the Earth ... which reappears from the red dwarf 's grasp . With no gravity to hold it ... the Earth slowly floats away . Elsewhere , stars are born . Other star systems - older , larger - continue to breathe . The solar system dies of crib death .

[ Grunts , Groans ] [ Alarm Sounds ] [ Woman On TV ] We interrupt this programming ... to bring you an emergency announcement ... from the Secretary General of the United Nations , Spencer Chartwell . [ Man ] Not since the moment of creation ... has our universe changed so infinitely ... so desperately , so quickly . [ Man ] Hey , you guys , listen . Listen . ! Tonight , for the first time in the briefhistory of mankind ... we are truly of one planet . Last evening we confirmed ... that the landing party of the Tellus Colony ... was massacred ... unprovoked , by an advanced alien civiliyation ... of tremendous power . Two hundred and twenty-five are dead . Twenty-five are unaccounted for . Because of destroyed communications , we 've only now learned ... that the Vesta Colony suffered the same fate . The alien civiliyation ... has not responded to our attempts at communication . Of this race we know nothing . The only clue to their people ... is the bloodshed they 've left behind . My fellow citiyens of Earth ... no matter where you stand on this planet - either beneath the sun 's warmth or the cold of night ... storm clouds of war gather over our home . Soon they may fall in unceasing thunderbolts . We must stand together against the deluge . We cannot possibly retreat . There is no moving the Earth . [ Woman ] Please stay tuned to this channel ... for further information . Government updates will follow . This is F. T.N. [ Kylen 's Voice ] I believe in you . [ Men Shouting , Indistinct ] [ Bougus ] Ho . ! Knock off the grab-ass and fall in . We are at war . Hurrah . ! War is what marines pray for . From here on out , every move is crucial ... all personnel vital . While combat-ready pilots are being dispatched into battle ... you people have been assigned a training mission ... nonetheless imperative to the global war effort . You will proceed via military heavy-launch vehicle ... to the space station Goddard . At Goddard you will board an inter-solar system cargo vehicle ... and proceed for 84 hours ... to the planet Mars . You will be issued rationed supplies - food , air , water for one week . You will be issued one urine and fecal collection device . Ayellow flashing light on the flight suit ... indicates full capacity . Your mission is to repair a malfunctioning Mars tracking drone ... vital to interplanetary communication . As part of your training ... there is no commanding offiicer . You will be on your own . From this moment until we win this war ... the only easy day is yesterday . I heard they had an army of six million . They can 't know that . How could they know ? You think they got better planes than we do ? They gotta be more advanced . I knew we couldn 't have been alone ... but now that we 're not , I don 't know what 's scarier ... being alone or - Do you think you 'd be scared if you saw one ? I remember when I was a kid and saw my first A.I. They looked so human , but something inside me couldjust tell . I felt that way when I saw my first InVitro . I don 't mean anything by that , Coop . Hit the sack . When the time comes to face ' em , we 'll all hack it fine . You okay ? Mm . [ Whimpering ] [ Gasps ] [ Sighs ] Sorry I woke you . I wasn 't asleep . Don 't take this wrong ... but , uh , I was just wondering - I mean - Well , I 've always heard that InVitros can 't dream . I dream . I know they never lived ... but when I dream , I see my parents . [ Chuckles ] Me too . Only I have nightmares about mine - same ones since I was five . What happens ? Hmm . [ Sighs ] My parents were Marine Corps officers ... in the Artificial Intelligence War . One night the A.I. Patrol attacked our house . My mother hid my sisters and I in this crawl space in the attic . I saw them kill my parents . Your sisters still alive ? Mm-hmm . That night during the attack , my sister tried to scream ... and I put my hand over her mouth and she bit into me . I still have the scar . What 's weird is we 're not close . Maybe I 'm the parent that they needed to grow away from ... or maybe seeing them reminds me of - They 've always looked to me my whole life . I need to get away from people looking to me . I joined for me - my life . I 'm tired of taking care of others for a while . Does that sound bad ? Did you ever lose anyone close ? [ Chuckles ] What the hell was that ? How does " Did you ever lose anyone close , " translate into " Please stick your tongue down my throat " ? I don 't know a lot about loss and nightmares ... so don 't go to moaning over it . I won 't be around here much longer anyway . [ Mechanical Whir ] [ Wind Whistling ] [ Hawkes ] What are you , looking to buy real estate ? Let 's go . There 's a war on . Load the gear . - First we secure our location . Low ? - Mm-hmm ? Our position ... is out in the middle of nowhere . They 're secured . Now unload this gear . - The HIST manual clearly states - - The manual ? When they drop you in the middle of a hairy fur ball ... you gonna take time to check the manual ? You do what you want . I 'll be happy to see you take one the minute we 're in battle . We do what we 're told . Oh , that 's right . Follow their rules . They 'll just keep taking from you , and you 'll let ' em . - [ Grunts ] - Hey ! - West , get off him . Hawkes . Hawkes . - Wait a minute , you guys . - [ Others Clamoring ] - [ Pagodin ] Help me get ' em apart . What the hell is wrong with you ? And you , knock it off . We have a mission to achieve . You think we 're going to blow it because you two need to butt heads ? We 're drivin 'on , so you two better get your heads screwed on right . Now , Low , tell West our position . Low ? [ Beeping ] We 're 45 degrees south , 271 west - the Hellas plains . That accounts for the sparse vegetation . They just started terra-forming this area . [ West ] The tracking drone is about four klicks from here . What should we do ? All right , grab your gear . Let 's move out . [ Panting ] [ Pagodin ] Hey , Coop . I can get up myself . Probably , but it looks like you could use a hand , and I 'm offering one . Ain 't easy for me to recognize a helping hand . If that 's a thank you , don 't worry about it . Someday you 'll pay me back . [ Shane ] Damphousse , replace the transceiver units ... and let 's go back . - We 've got about ten hours of sunlight . - [ Beeping ] - What 's this ? - That 's the Earth message . They made it a requirement that all off-Earth installations had to have one . It 's got pictures and sounds of Earth , in case an extraterrestrial found it . Mozart . - If only this had been our first contact with them . They would have never killed the colonists . - Whoa ! If they would have heard this first they would have wiped us out a long time ago ... - and I wouldn 't have blamed them . - Hey . - What the hell is that ? - I know this . I heard this in my 20th Century history class . They called this rock and roll . I think this group was called The Pink Floyd . They went like this - - Hey , ho , let 's go . - # # Hey , ho Let 's go # # - [ Laughing ] - # # Hey , ho , let 's go # # - # # # # [ Continues ] - [ Booming ] - Look ! What ? - [ Nathan ] Move out !

All right , we all go . Everyone carries water and their M-590s . Let 's do it . - All right . - Okay . - [ Man ] You got it ? - [ Woman ] Yeah . [ Shane ] Could be a Mars orbiter . - Maybe it 's a classified recon ship . - Something to do with the war . [ Shane ] Damphousse , Carter , West , Stone , Pags and me . The rest of you spread out , provide cover . - You don 't want me to go ? - Mm-mmm . You stay here in case something happens . Move out . - Radiation levels ? - [ Electronic Beeping ] Uh , let 's say we don 't stay long . [ West ] Can 't see anything . [ Vanessa ] What the hell is it ? Well , I can 't see a cockpit or anything . There 's no electronics . [ Grunts , Gasps ] [ Beeping ] - [ Groans ] - [ West ] Take cover ! Take cover ! [ Shane ] Move it ! Move , move , move ! - [ Shane ] Fall back ! - [ West ] Move out ! [ Shouts , Grunts ] Shane . ! [ Gasping ] Sit tight , West . I got you . You 're squared away . How 's Vansen ? Pressure 's stabilizing . - [ Shane ] Low is on . - Pags is dead . - [ Carter ] You all right , Vansen ? - [ Shane ] Yeah . Thanks . [ Electronic Whir ] [ Beeping ] West is solo . Damn it . What the hell is he doing ? You three move out with me . Rest of you stay here . [ Heavy Breathing ] [ Gunshot ] [ Groans ] [ Shane On Radio ] West ? [ Marines Chattering On Radio ] There it is . Stone , Carter , over here . [ Carter ] Stone , over here . [ Beeping ] I think it 's trying to surrender . I think it thinks we 're going to kill it . - [ Vanessa ] The odor 's gonna make me sick . - Smells sulfuric . Must be a scout - going toward Earth ... had to crank the chicken switch over Mars . - Probably sent a distress call . - That means there 'll be more coming . There 's got to be some way to figure it out . Don 't . It could carry some kind of disease . I never had a mother , but you sound like one . [ Growls ] Looks like it operates the vehicle - like a key . Yeah , some sort of encoded information . - What is this ? - [ Growls ] [ Cooper ] Him ? What does this have to do with him ? This is this ? It 's like a picture of his family or something . Maybe we ought to give it something to eat or drink . It wants water . Right . It 's probably one thing we have in common . - Let 's give it some water . - [ West ] What the hell is the matter with you ? We 're low on rations as it is , we 're cut to 30 % O2 flow ... and you guys want to waste water on this thing ? No . No way . This thing killed Pags ! God knows who else it killed . [ Air Lock Hisses ] I 'm giving it some water . Let 's show it what it means to be human . [ Gurgling , Groaning ] [ Cooper ] Not such a good idea . [ Gurgling , Groaning Stops ] [ Marines Murmuring ] [ Shane ] I can 't believe ... that it would be so afraid of us that it would kill itself . We 're the enemy . This is the first time I 've ever seen a dead body . Won 't be the last . # # # # [ " Taps " ] # # # # [ Continues ] # # # # [ Continues ] # # # # [ Ends ] [ Bougus ] Today you have been assigned ... your SA-43 endo-exo atmospheric attack jets . Your current orders are to take 48 hours ' leave . - Sir , ship us out , sir . - Sir , why have we been ... on accelerated training if we 're not going to be used , sir ? Listen . All we know is what you people found last week . We have no idea what lies ahead . We know basically nothing about the enemy - numbers , weapons , tactics . That 's why we have been losing ... and losing badly in every battle of this war . Don 't be in such a hurry . My advice - Go home . See your families . Could be the last time . Dismissed . Gonna go see your sisters ? I don 't think they want to see me . I don 't know if my parents want to see me . I never told them I was joining the Corps . They 'll want to see you . - Want to be a witness to that ? - [ Chuckles ] I 'll never get in one of those . - Ten of us Tanks were with the Tellus Colony . - [ Beeping ] Only makes the aliens just as bad . I 'm not going to die for them . What would you die for ? Nathan ? Mom , Dad , it 's Nathan ! - [ Boy ] Nathan . ! - [ Nathan ] Johnny . [ Grunts ] [ Johnny ] Come on . Nathan . Mom , Dad , this is my friend , Shane Vansen . It 's a pleasure , Mr. And Mrs. West . Dinner is - is almost ready . I was gonna give you a rock I pocketed on Mars ... but they took it . Come on inside . [ Nathan ] Hey , Neal . - Hey . - Shane , this is my brother , Neal . - Hi . - Hi . The TV said we 're about to begin another battle . I 'm here at the U.N. Task Force Headquarters ... at Vandenberg , California , receiving the latest reports - I heard the alien fighters are made of some unknown metal - that we can 't harm it . We 've only started reverse engineering on the one we found . It 's just rumors . Kylen 's brother told us - [ Announcer ] ... offiicial dispatch of the elite Marine Corps ... fighter squadron , the 127th ... better known as the Angry Angels , which left their base ... in Loxley , Alabama , sometime last evening . This is , without a doubt , the largest mobiliyation of Unified Earth force - It doesn 't seem like we can win . Don 't worry . This time out we 'll beat ' em . - How do you know ? - Well , because this time ... they 're going up against the 127 th - the Angry Angels . They will knock the enemy into Andromeda . [ Announcer ] ... seen from the Earth in the Northern Hemisphere ... about 50 degrees above the southeast horiyon . [ Footsteps ] Uh - Pags ... um ... I wanted to say something to you when they buried you ... but I don 't know what . And now that I 'm here , I still don 't . Besides , they don 't let anybody say anything at those things anyway . I guess I just wanted to say ... you were the only guy that was ever okay to me . I wish - I just wish , somehow , you could ... just feel my insides and know . Maybe right now you can . I doubt it . I wish I knew what you were feeling right now . See , I thought I knew what it would be like ... but seeing you up there ... all ... blood ... I just - I wish I could know if anything 's worth it . - [ Explosions ] - [ People Shouting , Screaming ] [ Man On TV ] Earth-based forces report major casualties . Here , on the U.S.S.

" The Earth forces ... the greatest mobilization of military might since the 20th century ... will surprise attack from behind enemy positions ... at two points , point " F , " here , and point " H , " here . The Marines will participate with the 8th Air Wing . This will be possible ... due to a fortuitous projected wormhole opening in the Galileo regions . From the captured information , we have ascertained ... their planes are faster , with a greater rate of climb : Ours are more maneuverable and better armed . It evens out . Surprise has been their best weapon . Now it 's ours . It 's too easy . Sir , if the plans weren 't planted ... then they at least would assume we have them . No doubt their intelligence informed them we would be unable to decipher the transmission . And , in fact , it has taken ... fifty Quantum Charno computers interlinked on four continents ... to decode the enemy 's complex language . And , as mentioned , their movements have since ... been in accord with the captured plans . Sir , are deploying to point " F " or " H , " sir ? 58th Squadron will operate in a support capacity at point " A. " - Point " A " ? - Here . Rear left flank . [ Murmuring ] Sir , why bother telling us the plan if we weren 't going to be a part of it ? You are part of it - rear left flank . Sir , request permission to transfer to 8th Air wing . - Denied . - Sir , with all due respect , we have the right - Sit down , Lieutenant . 58th will report to the naval space carrier Saratoga across theJupiter line ... by 0840 tomorrow . You 'll meet your squadron commander on board . Dismissed . [ Engines Roaring ] [ Jets Roaring , Whistling ] Gold Leader confirm Saratoga position at 32.5 megastatute kilometers . [ Shane On Radio ] Come in , Gold Leader . Confirm . Just a minute . I 'm getting interference on the light LI DAR . [ Beeping ] Check six . I had a bogey on the HUD . Must have been an asteroid or [ Beeping ] - Red Leader . Confirm bandit or recon vehicle . Confirm , confirm . LI DAR 4 . - Alien bogey , 10 : 00 . - I 'll turn intercept angle 30 degrees . Blue Team , White Team , watch six . Hack . 12 : 00 high . He jinked . Scram ! Scram ! - Lost it . - Must be jamming our LI DAR . Went below us like a fish on the line . - [ Cooper On Radio ] Let 's go fishing . - Negative . Don 't have the fuel . Return to designated course . I 'll call Space Com and report A.C.M. With the enemy . [ Alarm Sounding ] [ Man On P.A. ] Hammerhead disengage sequence complete . [ Woman On P.A. ] Change bay doors . [ Overlapping Conversations ] Hey , hey . What 's going on ? They look a little harried . Ten-hut ! 58 , report to the briefing area immediately . Space Com checked out your report of the enemy recon vehicle . Radio telescopes have since found not only ... no trace of enemy troops in the Groombridge system ... but rather a force amassing outside our solar system . Enemy plans were a set-up . At this point , no one needs their plans ... to know which direction they 're headed . [ Background Chatter ] [ Man ] Ten-hut . ! Sit down . I want to be able to look into your eyes . Courage , honor ... dedication , sacrifice - These arejust the words they used to get you here . Now the only word that means a damn to you is " life " - Yours ... your buddies : The one certainty in war is that in an hour , maybe two ... you 'll either still be alive or you 'll be dead . For the next hour , here 's your best chance of staying alive . The Trojan asteroid belt trails Jupiter 's orbit . Our objective is to hide in the debris . This may be as diffiicult as engaging the enemy . You 're gonna have to react to the pitch and yaw of the asteroids ... in order to keep out of sight , shielded from LI DAR . Intelligence says they 'll fly right by - then jump ' em . Now , nobody 's asking you to wax their tails . Your goal is to stall them . Our forces at Groombridge 34 ... have doubled back , and are right now passing through the Collie wormhole . If we successfully delay the enemy ... we 'll have reinforcements appearing from behind them ... and out of the sun . And that 's when we teach them something every human knows - payback 's a bitch . Now ... I 'm here because I 've been in a knife fight with them . They come at you in groups . Check your six . And they have a low angle of attack , so keep your nose level . Planes you 've been issued have an " upgripe " in the retro-thrusters . One more thing . It 's okay to be scared . I 'll see you in an hour . [ Indistinct Conversations , Commands ] Hawkes . [ Man On P.A. ] Begin cockpit engage sequence . Cockpit engagement sequence complete . Cleared for launch . [ Woman On Radio ] Initiate launch sequence . [ Nathan ] There it is . Let 's get behind cover . [ Shane ] Coming in . Stay tight . Thrusters at ten percent . [ Shane ] Red Four , you 're too close . 9 : 00 ! [ Nathan ] Saratoga , this is Blue Leader . We 're tied on . Acquired position alpha . [ Control ] Affiirmative , Blue Leader . Commodore , the enemy forces have adjusted their course . If they continue , they 'll avert the asteroid field . Saratoga ... - LIDARshows the enemy to be - - Affiirmative , Blue Leader . - Will advise . - Advise ? They 're moving away . - Hold position . - Could they know we 're here ? No . They 'd attack . Something 's got to bring them our way . [ Man ] Negative . Hold your position . Wait him out . # # # # [ Rock ] # # # # [ Singing Along ] # Hey , ho , let 's go # # # Hey , ho Let 's go # # - # # # # [ Continues ] - One of the 58th has moved out of position . I 'm baiting them past you . - I 'm going to help him out . - [ Shane ] Negative , Blue Leader . Hold your position . He 'll bring ' em past . Wait till we all can go . I 'm going in . Fangs out . [ Weapons Firing ] They 're locked in . Approaching position . Stand by , Alpha Attack Wing . - [ Beeping ] - My control 's froze . [ Nathan ] They 're locking in on him . Kill the right thruster , you stupid Tank . [ Shane ] They 're coming in fast . More direct six . - Hurrah ! - [ Nathan ] That 's a kill . [ Vanessa ] Blue 4 , watch out . You got enemy tied on . [ Man ] I can 't shake it . [ Man Screams ] This is Red Leader . A little help . [ Nathan ] I 'm on it . [ Cooper ] I 'm losing thrust . They 're all over me . I can 't hold it . - [ Beeping ] - Hawkes , hit the deck . I 'm coming in head-on . - [ Cheering ] - [ Cheering ] [ Cooper ] Not so fast . Bandit locked on you , Shane . Check your six . I can 't shake it . West , I can 't get to her . [ Nathan ] She 's in my line . If I engage , I might hit her . Hurrah . - Popped ' im good , West . - I didn 't fire . Who got the kill ? Sir , the Groombridge forces are through the wormhole ... and are inflicting severe damage on the enemy . [ Control ] 58th , this is Command . Damage is nominal . Enemy in retreat . Return to base . Objective achieved . [ Whispering ] Yes . [ Secretary General ] Because of the valiant efforts ... of the Marine Corps 58th Squadron ... the many peoples of Earth will breathe a single sigh of relief ... and tonight , at their graduation ceremony ... we honor them . [ Applause ] I believe even the great leader of the 20th century ... Winston Churchill would agree - never ... in the field of conflict ... has there been so much owed by so many to so few . We of Earth ... are proud and grateful . Celebrate well . Although I suppose the break in the storm is momentary ... the thunder shall return ... and the lightning ... will certainly strike again . [ Overlapping Conversations ] - Thank you . - [ Chuckling ] [ Wang ] Can you believe it ? Hey . Here you go . We 're gonna have a toast . A toast . Congratulations . Sir , I - Those words that day , they kept us alive . Save it . You 'll have all the chances in the world to thank me . I 've just been assigned as your squadron commander ... and if you ever pull anything like what you did out there under my command ... the only medal you 'll be wearing are cuffs in the brig . At least he doesn 't yell . Here 's to Pags . - Here 's to being alive for one more hour . - Cheers . [ All ] To Pags . [ Nathan Narrating ] Elsewhere , stars are born . Other star systems , older , larger ... continue to breathe . The solar System dies of crib death . If that 's what it takes ... then okay . If I must wait that long , then all right . Because when I think of this ... nothing is more desirable than the hope ... of watching that last day , when the sun flickers out ... with you beside me . We 'll sit alone on a dark chunk of ice at the top of the world ... and the stars above ... beyond , and between us ... will never shine brighter as we drift away ... into space . [ Man ] Watch your hands . Watch your hands .

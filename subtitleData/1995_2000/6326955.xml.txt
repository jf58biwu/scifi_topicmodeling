Thank you , Jane . Glad work with us . Thank you . I 'm excited to work with Dr. Sam chance Spydell . Careful , Jane , or your lips have to remain Spydell stuck to his ass . I detected little jealousy , Edward ? On Spydell ? Let 's leave , the man is a joke . The whole operation is a joke . You do not believe in Thor 's hammer ? May relieve me ! It 's the Golden Fleece , tinereþii fountain , the Holy Grail . There is a reason why these things are still a myth . They do not exist ! Then as the Vikings traveled thousands of kilometers in a rowboat ? - In vâslit ? - Da . Spydell is convinced the hammer special powers . I am the first to believe in the unbelievable things . But we know that Gua began sending the first wave in the ' 40s . There is no indication that knew something about the world before . - Man learns how lives , Eddie . - Damn , where 's Foster ? Only we risk ass here ? - Hei , Clyde , mã auzi ? - Perfect . Grãbeºte-to . Do not let a girl so you sweetheart to wait . Jordan , almost there . I am in the south of the camp . Large tent 's command center . Bishop supervisor , is there any record . If there is evidence that Gua excavated , there should be . But security ? There are armed guards in the area of ​ ​ excavation . That 's not a problem . But I saw the leader , Ash around . So be careful . I found him ! He found ! Damn , where is it ? Show me , show me ! Beautiful ! I told thi ... Come on , Doc . It was a joke . An archaeologist happy is successful , does not it , Mr. Bishop ? I 'll be happy when we succeed . Touche . Beautifully said . Do not be angry , Spydell ? Break 's over . Go to work . Foster , I 'm coming to you . Ash has just come to the camp . Something 's wrong . It does not look good . Bishop heading straight for tent . Get out of there ! Here it is . Jordan , I found something . Jordan , can you hear me ? Yes , Cade , I hear . What have you got ? Tu . Stay in place ! Foster ? Foster ? - What do I mean dig elsewhere ? - When watching the intruder , Mr. Ash saw something indicating that we dug in the wrong place . Not and can not even do his job , now he wants to do mine ? - That is my decision . - That 's my site , Bishop . Is no more . I 'll take him . Foster must have escaped . Otherwise , it would be here . It was weird , Eddie . I was talking at once and noise only . I should have . We have good equipment . I think he found something in his tent Bishop . What are we doing now ? Without Foster , we are nowhere . - Move forward . - No offense , Jordan , but Foster is our leader . How to continue without him ? We are a team , Eddie . Together we are stronger . Thin mind . Where you learned that ? The " Art of War " by Sunz . An article in the Times ... Ask April . Ask April ? Tips for Valentine ? Assuming Foster escaped , we will continue until we hear from him . Something is up . With Spydell always something going on , especially around you . I 'll see . Keep an eye on Bishop . - Mutha digging ? - Not I , Bishop takes over . I think the chief guard knows better than I do , where to find the hammer . Really ? I thought I heard împuºcãturi . Ash caught someone around . - Is anyone hurt ? - It seems not . Then he saw a kind of energy field in a part of the site . Energy Field ? That could supplement your theory , the physical properties of the hammer . Yes , but the center of the village has been here . Why would something valuable such as a hammer , buried elsewhere ? That 's a good question . If not ... maybe there were two camps . As the excavations you in Gottland . Where was he ? - Sanda or Muru ? - Right ! - Sanda , Muru . - Which one of them ? Sanda , although Muru was close . Sanda and Muru are hundreds of kilometers away . Close but yet so far . It depends how you look . A fascinating site . Maybe I can help . - I have good news , Mabus . - I 'm not expecting anything . I saw the signs . We can finally get to have him in our backyard . To use the name given to the people , Thor 's Hammer ... Strange gave a lightning god , a name to something unique to Gua . Lightning will be an appropriate image , They will see the true power . That must be it , Eddie . Gua will " power of powers . " - Where the hell Foster ? - You must contact us before . Absolutely . To reach him , just you and me . Yes , yes , we are a team . Together we are stronger . Listen to April expensive . Good . What are we doing ? We can do only one thing , to find the hammer . - Prior to his Bishop . - That is all ? That 's the plan ? You got a better idea ? We can do it , Eddie . With or without Foster . We need to do . Come on . Sounds promising ... And judging after ... The artifacts that we found , I would say this was built in settlements around a thousand . Cam when Leif Eriksson , left the West to Iceland . It is said to have slipped further south of Newfoundland , but their legends suggest that Leif has sent a ship before , a special ship that magical journey through time and space . A ship loaded hammer . Legend says that the gods have punished . Geloºi the power Vikings sent a fireball in the sky hammer , which of course led to the decline ... Vikings . Dr Spydell ? You might interest you that . Detecting a remarkable electromagnetic activity underground . Perhaps Bishop 's right . Here . Indications are really strange . They are similar to the quantum bags . - There is a problem . - We need to talk , Dr. Channing . - At your disposal , as always . - No jucaþi theater . I just called the office . The real Charles Channing , excavating in Libya . - I assure you , sir ... - I trusted him from the beginning . Go inside . You 'll be able to tell us everything . And you . I noticed that two of them are good friends lately . Gândeºte-te , nu ne grãbim . Dl Ash se încãlzeºte . Good ... Channing No , but I know more about antiques than this guy , or any archaeologist elitist , particularly when it comes to - As it is worth on the market . - You 're treasure hunters ? I tell them science , but we 're both here for the same reason . For money and a beautiful friend with whom I share . How dare let it down Dr. Spydell at your level ? Enough . Who left , all . I just talk to him . - Tell me who you are really . - The name is Cutter , Jake Cutter . We stole antiques for others . I found out that it 's more profitable to ºuntez intermediaries . Work with the intruder who was here yesterday ? No , my friend , I work alone . Less with which to divide the money , or where to escape , you know what I mean ? It does not really matter , because anyway ... I have you . You know what I mean ? They found him . Spydell says he found a hammer . Tie him . If he tries to escape , kill him . - Finally , after all these years . - Flashing like to take pictures . Point to Edster . Foster ? Jordan ? Eddie ? Jordan ? Is anyone there ? Spydell ? Foster says something . How can I help ? Foster ! - Well brother , it 's done . - Or what ? MA împuºti ? No , but they will . Opreºte too ! He Channing , or whatever his name . He took it . Gãseºte-l . - Why did you take the hammer ? - I ... I 'm looking for a long time . It 's my life . And now he has it . Or was it your plan ? No , I swear . The hammer is my rehabilitation . I was ridiculed atâþia years now ended . You 're right , Spydell . The hammer was found . Your life was fulfilled . Completely . Therefore ended . - Eddie , you hear me ? - Yes , Jordan . We hammer . - I 've got to Spydell ? - Yes . - Now just go . - It 's not that simple . - I saw Foster . - Where ? Where I found the hammer . - Foster here ? Some buses ? - I do not know where it is . I know only that Spydell dig hammer And camera flash ... Something happened hammer . - Foster was there , but it was not . - You 're good ? There are not . Eddie , something happened to Foster . Believed to suffer . Aºadar light made a hammer and you saw Foster ? An image of him as a ghost . - As if it was stuck between two seats . - It 's not logical . Before it stops transmitting , Foster says she has found something . - You think it was the hammer ? - How to be ? I hammer . At least so I think . Yes , I hammered , but the edge is complete , it 's broken . How was the quatrain ? All the power of those who unearth , joining them ... The earth itself will be consumed ... joining them ... - If the hammer is composed of two parts ... - May Foster has other . Maybe he 's consumed . Eddie , studying it ... - You must know how it works . - I 'm not really optimal conditions . - This place is full of Gua . - Leave him to me . What do we have here ? Good good ... So it will work . Let 's see what happens if we give him some energy . Come on , baby . Let current to flow . Well , Gua . Answers . How many are in camp Gua ? I am looking until you kill the tranquility ... - Five . - Which ? - Bishop I and guards . - I want to know everything about the hammer . Goodbye ! Wait ! It 's an exploration device , the only one of its kind , built thousands of years ago by our empiriciºtii . They used to visit the planet at the beginning of your civilization . Now is a weapon that will condemn your race to destruction . How does it work ? It allows us to curve space-time continuum . During a storm in the era of ice , I lost device . But the Vikings have found and used it to travel . - Until another storm tore it in two . - The legends are true . When starting to get exciting ... - Foster ? - Jordan ? Eddie ? Hang in there , buddy . We 'll bring them back . I do not know where I am . - If I hear ... - Yeah , man , I 'm here . They have , when you have two halves ... Caught here ... using force against them ... Together ... you can do . No , Foster . Waiting , waiting ! Together ... You found it ? - This does not look at you . - Who will blink ? - I think you . Do not sit there . Find it ! There is a hammer Viking is Gua . That 's why you hired Spydell place to find yourself . And did the job well before he died . Unless you are Spydell 's assistant , then who you are ? I 'm a friend of his 117 . - He was in my tent ? - Had half the hammer . Aºadar 117 , it was blocked by hammer . Let 's make a deal , you tell me the hammer , and I 117 I am telling you about . My friend , I read you like a book . The Vikings were just some garbage that we found something lost . Something more powerful than they could understand . - How did it 117 put the job ? - Nostradamus had predicted As predicted so that you will be înfrânþi . Hammer was an exploration device . Why does he want Mabus ? - How do you know of Mabus ? - It 's my turn , reminds îþi ? The device moves material beings long distances in an instant . Like armies ? An exploration tool , used as a weapon of war . - Sounds to me quite Gua . - How many has 117 adherents ? - One hundred million , maybe two . - Minds . - Does not matter . Not enough . - How the device works ? When the two parts are joined creates a field of energy , which exceeds space and time creating portals in the universe . How could that Foster , or an army , disappear ? Disturbance field , can cause the two halves separate device , to react unpredictably . When pieces are separate , open portals in one direction only , at low power . That ended mastery of the Vikings , after separating pieces . Exactly . But together , the device has power to open and to close the portals smoothly . A force beyond any imagination . " Use force against them ... together ... " Dar Channing ? I suppose it 's 117 's ally . Channing is an idiot , a treasure hunt with high IQ . - One last question ... - I 'm tired . If inputs and outputs hammer creates time and space , what happens to people who are caught between them ? 117 Îþi worry about ? Poth unlimited survive if ... Poth tolerate low temperatures and pressure . Otherwise , you die slowly frozen . Now I 'm tired . Thi-is time . Here . You are here ! O voi face relativ nedureros . Poth die , knowing that we 've almost won . Wait , you bastard ! Leave ax . If you want to have the chance to get your hammer recover . Aºadar , work together . So I , sucker and business is very simple . You hammer receives , I get the girl , that woman . Eddie , nu ! - I think I leave you alive ? - Safe . If I do not go by car and senorita in 5 minutes , I do hammer leveled . Hammer is indestructible . Maybe , but it will be done pieces . The girl , now ! - I found him . - Leave it or I will blow . A keychain ... Nice try . - Take them and kill them . - You know who I am ? Eddie Nambulous , known as Crazy Eddie . Mr. Paranoid Times , Cade Foster 's right hand . And this beautiful lady is Jordan Radcliff . See if these names mean anything to Mabus . Duceþi them to the main site . I carefully supervised . - Are you crazy ? - I 'm afraid of losing him on Foster . Mabus , we both PC device . Put them together and bring them to me . - There is and something else . - I captured two people . A woman named Radcliff and a man named Nambulous . Claiming to be associates of 117 . 117 ? I felt presence there . It was caught in the vortex center and might no longer be alive . - What is your will ? - Use the device . Bring them to me . Let them kneel in front of me Now that power is restored powers . God ! Do not get your worry , I have a plan . I do not worry . Profeþia is împlineºte . Power powers , Gua is back ! Now ! Foster Come on ! If you want to live , you should do it now . Come on , buddy . Come on ! - Glad you 're back . - Not the same without you . How did you do it ? How did you remove ? With a little advice from " Ask her April " . I understand that the hammer is a kind of trans-dimensional device - The remoleculizare . - More information ºleau , Eddie . Basically has the ability to instantly move matter through space . - A vessel Viking . - Or a ship spaces . Or an invading army . Each time you apply a power hammer , you reappear . - But they went separated . - Puteaþi me to see ? Yeah , looks like a ghost . You see something there ? No . I do not know . When Bishop explained to Jordan , why hammer does not work I thought the only way to open the portal was to join the two pieces . - Good work , Eddie . - In fact , Foster gave me the idea . You said , finds a way to use force against them . Hammer completely and we as a team . I knew that the guards will find our half And that if he knew who we are , What keeps us up there together the two pieces . ... So I worked together . As always . - It was a huge risk , Eddie . - I have taken it , man . You 're our leader . We need you . Naturally , I did not know what was if it was not . That was your plan ? - Operate . - For now . The hammer is still there somewhere . And I guarantee that if it has not Mabus , will do everything to get back . There are times when îþi determination is low . When you feel helpless against one stronger than you . Caught in a fault created by hammer I could not help them and Eddie Jordan , against the Gua . They admit they fight to the end ... And not quit . I owe them life . Gua evaluated the ability of resistance people individually . But , as said Jordan , a team is stronger than separated members . Working together we can rise to stop this invasion . The second wave is coming every day . If I would lose my life in this struggle , will be others who will fight equally grim . Until finally , we will defeat Gua . Translation and adaptation Florin ( c ) thin

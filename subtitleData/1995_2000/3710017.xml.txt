 Morris ? Morris , I need to talk to you ! Morris , it 's me . Are you in there ? Morris ? Morris , if you 're in there , open the damn door ! Morris ! Morris , open up ! Morris , I need to talk to you ! Gail Anne is dead . It was my fault . Morris ! Morris , I need to talk to you . Come to the door , Morris , please . Answer the door , dammit ! Oh , no ! No . Oh , God , no ! No , God ! God , no . No , no , no , no , no . Please , no . Please ! X-Files Season 2 Episode 23 - Soft Light Two apparent abductions in a month , then this one . My contact says the Richmond PD 's hit a brick wall , so I said we 'd have a look . - Who 's your contact ? - Kelly Ryan . She was one of my students at the academy . She 's been bumped up to detective and she 's nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved . - Kelly ? - Agent Scully . - Hi . This is Agent Mulder . - Hi . Thank you for coming . - You 're welcome . - Heard a lot about you . We 'll talk later . The missing man is Patrick Newirth , aged 52 . He 's a top executive with Morley Tobacco , up here for a meeting . - He arrived by train . - How do you know he 's missing ? He set a wake-up call for 6am . The operator tried , but got no answer . Mm . Scotch . It looks like he barely touched it . Needless to say , he missed his meeting . After three hours , they sent hotel security up . The door was locked , security chain fastened . And when they broke in , no Patrick Newirth . - Windows ? - Locked from the inside . We 're six storeys up , no fire escape . No way in or out of this room . - Agent Scully , what are you lookin ' at ? - Uh , the heat register . - You think anyone could squeeze in there ? - You never know . - You guys turn up any forensics evidence ? - Uh , just this . - Scully , look at this . - What is it ? We don 't know . The hotel claims it wasn 't here before Mr Newirth checked in . There were similar burn marks at the previous crime scenes . - Was Patrick Newirth a smoker ? - No . His wife says he loathed cigarettes . - Yet he worked for a tobacco company . - Did you run a test on it ? Yes , sir . Mostly carbon , with some potassium and trace minerals . - Could be residue from burnt human flesh . - Does this look like an arm to anybody ? - An arm ? - What are you thinkin ' , Mulder ? This burn mark is right where I 'd stand to answer the door , right ? - Yes . - And I 'd only look out the peephole if there was something to look at , right ? - That makes sense . - Could you have this bulb dusted for prints ? - Of course . And can you run those against Mr Newirth 's ? Do you have his prints ? From his toiletries and check-in slip . Check them against all hotel employees and guests . - Anything else ? - What 's the name of the last missing person ? That would be Margaret Wysnecki . Thanks . This should do it . Is this your first case , Detective ? - Yes , sir . - Any idea why they gave it to you ? No one else wanted it . Because of the lack of evidence , this is still a missing persons case not likely to end up on the front pages . I wouldn 't be so sure about that . Can I ask what you think may have happened ? At first blush ? Spontaneous human combustion . You 're doing just fine . - Having a little fun ? - What do you mean ? - Spontaneous human combustion ? - I have case files of bodies reduced to ash with no attendant burning or melting . Rapid oxidation without heat . Let 's forget that there 's no scientific theory to support it . OK . Hey , Scully . Can you spare a prophylactic ? What are the odds of that , huh ? Darkness covers a multitude of sins . Check this out . My newest tool in the fight against crime . $ 49.95 at your local hardware store . Neat trick . For your birthday , I 'll buy you a utility belt . - Look at this , Mulder . - Hm . What do we know about the victim ? Margaret Wysnecki , aged 66 . Widowed , retired from Laramie Tobacco , where she worked for 36 years . Tobacco ? Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco . Half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks . - Could be just a coincidence . - Yeah , probably . The first missing person , Gail Anne Lambert , worked for Polarity Magnetics Inc . They didn 't find any prints . Why should the prints on the bulb mean anything ? I don 't know . Oh , look at this , Scully . Someone forgot to empty the trash . M Wysnecki , round trip to Hampton Roads , Virginia . Return train dated March 17th . - The day she disappeared . - Patrick Newirth came by train . And Gail Anne Lambert ... Uh , no . Nothing here puts her near the train station . - Maybe that detail was overlooked . - What 's the significance ? Maybe these people are being hunted , and the hunter 's working the train station . What about spontaneous human combustion ? Maybe it 's not spontaneous . Call your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station . Suspicious male in the alley behind the station . I 'm gonna check him out . Roger that , 64 . I 'm on my way . Sir , could I speak with you ? Hold on ! I only wanna ask you a couple of questions ! All right , stop right there . Don 't move . Just hold it . Put your hands in the air , sir . Stay ... away from me . What do you think you 're doin ' ? Come on outta there . We just wanna talk to you . Stay away from me . I don 't wanna hurt you . - Move it . - Hands where we can see them . Please ... I 'm warning you . - I 'm a dangerous man . - Keep movin ' , pal , out where we can see ya . All right . I want you to lie face down on the ground . Don 't ... come any closer . Get down on the ground , sir . Now ! Please ! You don 't understand . - Oh , God ! No ! - Barney ? Don 't ! No ! Stay away ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Not again ! No ! No ! No ! No ! - What happened here , Kelly ? - I sent two patrolmen down here . They lost radio contact with them just after midnight . - All they found was two more scorch marks . - Nothing else ? No . Suddenly this could be a cop-killer case , and I 'm indirectly responsible . - You were just doing your job . - They wanna know why I sent these men . - If I tell them I 've involved you , they 'll snap . - Those prints ? I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests then through the national databases . No match . - Some first case , huh ? - Make sure you hang on to this case . I 'm sure something will turn up . - These ideas of yours . Care to share them ? - Not yet . - You don 't have a clue , do you ? - He was here , Scully . I was right about that . - So where does this leave us ? - Maybe with enough to identify the killer . - How ? - He was here last night . He was also probably here on March 17th and March 31st . The days that the other two people disappeared . That leaves us with three days of station video tapes to check and hopefully find out who this guy is . - That 's assuming we 're looking for a guy . Either way , the security camera 's our only witness . It could be any one of these people , Mulder . Or none of them . We 've gone through the entire week and I 'm still not sure how to find him . That 's it for March 22nd on the arrival deck . - Let 's go back to the terminal tape . - Again ? He 's gotta be on at least one tape . Chances are he 's not carrying a sign with an arrow on it . There you go . See this guy , right here ? He 's always here . What 's he doing ? - Looking at the floor . - Why 's he doin ' that ? Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station . - Can you freeze this and blow it up 200 % ? - Sure . OK . Can you reframe and blow it up some more ? See , he 's got something on his jacket . Let 's see if I can pull it up . - Polarity Magnetics . - That 's where the first victim worked . Looks like it 's been closed up . - Yes ? - We 're Agents Mulder and Scully , FBI . We 're looking for a man who may have worked here . - When was this taken ? - March 22nd . Do you know him ? Sure I know him . Dr Chester Banton . - He was my business partner . - You mean he 's not any more ? I don 't know . I would assume not . This is the first I 've seen of him in five weeks . - I wondered if he wasn 't gonna turn up dead . - How 's that ? Chester was involved in a terrible accident here . Polarity Magnetics does , or did , primarily two kinds of research . Mostly we designed maglev applications - people movers , bullet trains . But , for Chester , that just paid the bills for the theoretical stuff he was interested in . - Which was what ? - Researching dark matter . Quantum particles , neutrinos , gluons , mesons , quarks . - Subatomic particles . - The mysteries of the universe . - The very building blocks of reality . - Except no one knows if they exist . Chester was sure they did . So sure , he bet his life on it . This is where it happened . Chester was working to isolate a new particle . - He 'd been working on it for a year . - This is a particle accelerator . One fifth the power of the Texas Supercollider in the space of a Wal-Mart . - Powered by what ? - A couple of billion megawatts . - Virginia Power loved us . - Exactly what happened here ? The work involved bombarding beta particles with an alpha target negative against positive . Chester had started the countdown when he realised he 'd made a mistake . Something needed readjusting in the target room . Except you can 't stop the countdown once you 've begun . There was time to safely make the change but I had left the room for a minute when Chester decided to go in . I didn 't realise until it was too late that the door had locked behind him . Look at this . As far as I can tell , it burned Chester 's shadow right into the wall . - How did he survive ? - All I can figure is the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass . - They slid right through his body . - Like getting an X-ray . A two-billion-megawatt X-ray . When I saw on the monitor what was happening that Chester was trapped in here , I panicked . I cut the power , but it was too late . I remember looking , and ... seeing Chester . He was perfectly calm almost like he wanted it to happen . Like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorised in some kind of physical way . As if the truth might come into him . Excuse me . What do you think , Scully ? Well , this looks like the same kind of material found at the other crime scenes . Maybe it is some kind of spontaneous human combustion . I 'm less convinced of that now . - What do you think it is ? - I don 't know . Whatever it is , it 's connected to the person of Dr Chester Banton . Maybe even part of him . Well , whatever it is , we have to find him . I know of only one place to start lookin ' . There 's no sign of him , Mulder . Maybe he 's moved on . - What are you looking at ? - On the tape , he kept staring at the floor . I 'm trying to figure out what he might have been looking at . Maybe the exposure affected his mind . Nonsensical repetitive behaviour is common in mental illness . You trying to tell me something ? I called Detective Ryan . She 's having the prints on the bulbs checked against Banton 's . Did you tell her about his accident ? No . I only told her he was a possible suspect , and that it was too early to get her hopes up . And that we have more questions than answers . - Like ? - Like a motive . Like a murder weapon . - Like ... - What if Dr Banton ... Look here . There are hardly any shadows cast . - What do you mean ? - The lighting in here is diffused . Soft light . What if that 's what Dr Banton was looking for ? Looking for his shadow ? Dr Banton . Stop right there ! Dr Banton ! Please ... just leave me alone . We 're federal agents , Dr Banton . You don 't understand . You 're making a big mistake . Stay away from me . Wait ! It 'll kill you . It doesn 't care who you are . Oh , thank God ! - I thought he was to be kept in the dark . - He insisted on soft light . It 's the only way he 'd let us open the door . How can you even ... begin to understand what it 's like ? - We 're trying to understand . - Living in a train station day and night . Living like a bum . Afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen . The accident in the lab , the quantum bombardment . You believe that altered you physically ? You could ... You could say that . Can you tell us how ? Even if I could , you wouldn 't understand . - But it has something to do with dark matter . - It has everything to do with dark matter . My shadow isn 't mine . It 's ... It 's like a black hole . It splits molecules into component atoms . It unzips electrons from their orbits , reduces matter into pure energy . - That 's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert ? - It wasn 't me . Gail Anne was my colleague . She ... The night after the accident , I went to see her . I was just standing in the doorway . I was ... I was looking right at her . And then she was gone . You have no control over it ? If I could control it , do you think I would let it go around killing people ? All I can do is study it . Try and divine its ... its true nature before they do . They ? The government . They 're after me . And when they find me they 're going to do the brain suck they 've just been dying to do . " Brain suck " ? For the purpose of ? For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish . And don 't think they wouldn 't kill to get it . But if they killed you , wouldn 't your shadow just ... Disappear ? Who knows ? That 's why you have to get me out of here . If I die ... there could be nothing left to tether this thing . Excuse me . I 'm gonna have to ask you to discontinue interrogating the suspect . This is Detective Barron , the primary on this case . - I was wondering what your involvement is . - We caught the guy . I appreciate that . But no one seems to recall inviting the FBI in on this case . Agent Mulder and I are here in an unofficial capacity . Then who brought you in ? We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case . Banton 's prints place him at two of the crime scenes . And Transit Authority tapes show him in the vicinity of two of the most recent victims . - I 'd say this case is pretty much explained . - Really ? Have you talked to Dr Banton ? Don 't try to interrogate me , Agent Mulder . I 'm not the suspect . You know nothing about this case , so you stuck it with Detective Ryan . - Let her decide how to proceed . - She is handling this case . She 's done well . I see no reason not to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred . Transferred ? Where ? To the city jail , for his arraignment . I don 't think you appreciate the danger that he poses . I don 't think you have the authority to tell me or anyone else in my unit how to do our job . I think we can handle it from here , Agent Mulder . We 'll call you if there 's anything more you can do . Come on , Mulder . Let 's go . Soft light . He needs soft light . I hope you know what you 're doing , putting Detective Ryan 's ambition over good sense . Ambition ? She 's a woman trying to survive the boys ' club . - Believe me , I know how she feels . - You never put yourself ahead of your work . And that 's what 's happening here . Look , the fact is , we have no jurisdiction here . We were called in as a favour . And we just handed the A-bomb to the Boy Scouts . I 'm sure precautions will be taken . I 'm sure Robert Oppenheimer heard that from the same government Dr Banton is afraid of . You believe this paranoia about brain sucking ? That man is scared , and not just of his own shadow . As brilliant as Dr Banton may be , he is also clearly delusional . - He shows almost every textbook indicator . - We 've both seen the physical evidence . Look , I don 't know how to explain it . But that 's not our job . I don 't know what else we should do . I think I do . All you 've given me is a name . Chester Ray Banton . - Dr Chester Ray Banton . Do you know him ? - No . Should I ? He 's being held by the police in connection with several bizarre murders . He 's a physicist , researching quarks , gluons ... Dark matter . - He thinks the government is out to get him . - It 's tax season . So do most Americans . - He believes his life is in danger . - Is he a dangerous man ? Yes . Yes . - Where is he being held ? - Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital . - But not for long . - I 'm afraid I can 't help you . - Why ? - Last time I helped you , I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours . Yes , I know . And you can trust them as you trust me , I promise . Dead men can 't keep promises . The next time , the blood and regret could be yours . I 'm not at your beck and call , Agent Mulder . I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you . Promise you won 't contact me again unless absolutely necessary . I promise . Frank , are your lights on ? Ours just went ... Hi . We 're here to transfer Chester Ray Banton . I have orders he 's being transferred tomorrow . Due to the power outage , there 's been a change of plans . No one 's supposed to go in there ! Here . Quickly . Who are you ? No . Don 't do this . Please , no . No , don 't . Leave me alone . - What did you find out , Scully ? - Richmond PD had two officers outside . - They didn 't see anybody come in . - The nurse said there were three men . Three ? The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks away . Somebody posing as a city engineer . Somebody who knew how to take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities . Somebody from the government coming for Dr Banton ? Being paranoid doesn 't mean he 's wrong . But my guess is they failed , and Dr Banton 's on the loose . - That 's what Detective Ryan thinks . - I just saw her . She was in charge of his transfer and arraignment . She 's in some pretty hot water . Maybe that was an appointment he wasn 't meant to keep . Let 's go . - Where ? Mulder , wait . Where are we going ? - You heard what Dr Banton said last night . - He said a lot of things . - Put yourself in his head . He hasn 't killed himself only because he 's afraid of releasing the dark matter . That 's just a theory , and a pretty wild one at that . Whether or not Dr Banton is actually telling the truth , he believes he is . And so does whoever tried to take him last night . All he 's tried to do is control this thing . He 'll go to the one place where he thinks he can do that . And we gotta get there first . Don 't turn on the light , Chris , unless you wanna die . Chester , what the hell is going on ? The FBI are looking for you . Where have you been ? There 's no time to explain . Just come with me . - What 's this about ? Talk to me . - We found the dark matter , Chris . It 's real . - What are you talking about ? - Don 't you understand ? I 'm it . - It 's ... It 's in me . - The accident ? They 're coming for me . We have to destroy this thing before they get here . No ! You can 't go back in there ! Police ! I 'm placing you under arrest , Dr Banton . - A lot of people will die if you do this . - Step against the wall , sir . I 'm begging you . I don 't wanna hurt you . I said step against the wall . Now ! I 'm sorry . Let 's go . We don 't have much time . - Chester ! - No matter what they say to you later you 're doing the right thing . Lock it up , Chris . All right . Let 's get the accelerator on line . I 'm afraid not , Chester . - You can do it , Chris . - I can . But I 'm not . No ! Chris , tell me you 're not working for them . - Wish I could , Chester . - You son of a bitch ! - Careful . We don 't want you to hurt yourself . - I 'll die before I 'll let them use me ! You 're lightning in a bottle , Chester . We 're not about to let you die . Chris , don 't do this . Listen to me ! This is wrong ! You 're making a terrible mistake ! I 've got him . He 's not goin anywhere till you pick him up . Chris ! Chris ? Chris ! What 's happening ? Chris ! Chris ... - Mulder , that 's Detective Ryan 's car . - I was afraid of this . Mulder . Dammit . What 's that noise ? It 's the accelerator . Mulder ! Scully , look at this . He must have killed her and then killed himself . He couldn 't have . This chamber 's been sealed from the outside . By who ? Agent Mulder . I thought you agreed not to contact me again about this . - You lied to me . - About ? About Chester Ray Banton . You knew who he was . - And you used me to lead you to him . - You contacted me , Agent Mulder . I won 't be your stalking-horse , or the government 's . You seem to be mistaken about how much control you exercise over this arrangement . You killed Dr Banton ! - Have you lost your mind ? - The nurse identified you . A young detective is dead because of you . Who do you answer to ? ! Despite my loyalty to my predecessor I 've never made you any promises . All right . Promise me somethin ' right now . Promise me this 'll be our last meeting . We 're finished . You 're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone , Agent Mulder . Mulder ! I didn 't kill him . The mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home . - How are you doin ' ? - I 'm not sure how to feel about this , Mulder . She was my student , and she came to me for help . - I know it must be hard . - This shouldn 't have happened . This never should have happened . I 'm sorry I 'm late . I got hung up at the Richmond PD . - Doing what ? - A missing-person report was filed by a Dr Morris West , a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics . I 'm not sure I follow you . Dr Christopher Davey hasn 't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared . - Do they have any leads ? - No . None . But you do ? What if it wasn 't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator ? Well , if Banton 's not dead , then where is he ? Dr Davey would have been helpful to us . We 'll be studying this man for a long time . Subtitles by : syafiQ a.k.a basikalbaru I made this !

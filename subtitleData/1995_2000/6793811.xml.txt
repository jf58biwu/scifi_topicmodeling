 Shouldn 't be here . [ sighs ] Moving on to ... [ typing ] [ beeping ] Wolf 336 , F Class star , at right ascension 7.36.7 . 5.21 declination . I thought that was the last one . Why did you think that ? Because you said that it would be . No , I distinctly remember forgetting that . I don 't know why I put up with this . Oh . Yes , I do . Because I let you drive . I 'm rideshare hostage . F Class star . Recent variability . 14.6 light years away . This is just nuts anyway , the whole approach . SETI 's tough enough on microwave band . Now you want to search FM ? With all that noise ? Might as well look for a needle in a haystack ... of needles . [ typing ] [ phone ringing ] Station 5 . [ Woman ] familiar to you , Zane ? ly Honey , I 'm trying to get out of here , but , as usual , Calvin is holding me up again . Should be home by 1 : 00 , 1 : 30 . 1 : 30 , Tuesday , Wednesday , a.m. , p.m. ? What can I say ? I 'm a rideshare hostage . I 'm going to go ... Look , I will try- - [ man laughing ] Where are you ? Oh , I 'm having a drink with Becky . You 're in some bar while I 'm here working ? Mmm . Oh , there 's a cute hockey player here , too , but he 's only in town for one night . All right , I give up . What do you want ? I want your ass in bed , Zane . Okay . I 'll leave now if you leave now . But do not talk to any strangers on the way out . I 'll see you at my place in 83 minutes , okay ? You swear you 'll be there , Zane ? I really don 't want a repeat of last week . Look , if I say I 'm going to be there , I will be there , end of story . There is nothing more important to me right now than- - [ loud rumble ] [ high-pitch frequencies ] [ rumbling , frequencies continue ] Good solid spike . Nice symmetry to the modulation . Detection protocol , now . Zane . Zane ? Confirmation Phase 1 . Swing dish 5 degrees off axis . [ typing ] And signal fades . Looking good . Now swing dish back on target . And signal returns . Defiantly sky-based . Wolf 336 , you are howling . [ howls ] [ howling ] Phase 2 . Initiating software check . Jumping ahead to Phase 3- - second source verification . Who 's still online ? Green Bank , Ohio State , Moffett Field . Checking , here . Still checking . Be there . Just be there . We got to get another ear on this thing . Software self-checks . Phase 2 complete . I 'm just waiting- - Oh , come on , Moffett . You 're killing me . I 'm dying here . Pick up the phone so we can confirm this ... thing . [ sounds fading ] Nothing . [ tires screeching ] Zaminsky ! Zaminsky , this is not valet parking ! Stalled out on me . Stalled on me , this piece of ... Sorry , uh , sir . Sorry . [ alien sounds ] That 's it ? 42 seconds . We listened all night . All night , all morning , and the sound never repeated . It 's 42 seconds of non-random , non-Earth-based signal . This could be it , Gordy . Sounds compressed like a military burst communication . No way . No way . Not at 107 megahertz . 107 ? What the hell are you doing so far below the microwave ? Good question . So this is a variable star ? This , uh , Wolf 336 ? 14.6 light years away . All right . Okay . So if it is a variable , it expands and contracts dramatically . So , gentlemen , maybe you can explain to me how intelligent life can actually develop in such a volatile environment . Well , it 's only been unstable for the last- - [ both ] 50 years or so . which means it 's possible some life can still exist there . Exactly . Maybe this is distress call . An SOS . Maybe they 're sending out their Encyclopedia Galactica , jettisoning all their knowledge before it goes down with the ship . Maybe- - - Zane . Zane ! It lasted 42 seconds , and it never repeated . [ sighs ] That 's why we have to stay on this one , Gordy , in case it does . Look , I 'll pull double shifts . I 'll pull triple shifts if I have to . But I want priority status and I want dish time . I want serious dish time . During normal business hours , preferably . Calvin , why don 't you , uh- - Why don 't you go home and get some sleep , okay ? Go ahead . Zane . [ squeaking ] It 's a mandatory 20 % cutback . Tracking station has a fixed operating cost . I can 't touch that . I 've got to look at personnel . Are you even shitting me ? Look , I can- - I can swing a month 's pay , you know , instead of two weeks . Maybe extend the health benefits two weeks beyond that , but ... Let me see if I got this straight . I come to you- - [ squeaking ] I come to you with what may be the preeminent discovery of the 20th century- - the possibility of extrasolar life , and I get shit-canned for it ? Zane ... I know how important this is . But searching for E.T.s in this political environment is a tough sell on Capitol Hill . We don 't start spending money on harder science , we 're going to lose it . Well , let 's forget about me for a second . What about the signal ? I 'm skeptical , but it is interesting . I 'll pass it along to decoding . See if there 's a pattern recognition there , but , uh ... Look , I don 't have to tell you . You know the rule . If you can 't confirm it- - Then it doesn 't exist . What asshole made up that rule ? Can we fire him instead ? It doesn 't please me to be losing the brightest and the best . I wish there was another way . I honestly do . [ sighs ] [ Man over radio ] Well , it is finally cooling off in the Southland after a day of near-record temperatures , but hot again tomorrow and hot again on Thursday with no let up- - [ turns off ] Hey , how are you doing for money ? You know , if you need me to , I could maybe- - No , no . There 's a study program up north . The guy who runs it , Bill Wyatt , was begging me to come up there . I might give him a call . Zane , you 're not really thinking about going back to it , are you ? Oh , God , we had a bell-ringer this morning . Really good signal . I just- - I just couldn 't confirm it in time . You had something really good last year , too . Turned out to be what ? A broken microwave oven . What 's your point ? There 's always something to give me false hope ? That I 'm wasting my life ? I didn 't say that . But , you know , it 's interesting that you did . Oh . Come on . Someone is watching . What ? How in the hell did I wind up with someone like you ? I get tired of rich guys with good futures . No , really . What is it you see in me ? What made you call me the first time ? Boy , when their self-worth goes ... Mmm . Okay , I see a man of great intelligence , dedication , cute little kind of insecurity , a little paranoia . This went to shit fast . Well , Zane , why do we always have to analyze everything ? Can 't you just trust that I love you ? Algorithms , I trust . Boolean logic , I trust . Beautiful women , they just mystify me . Two years and we 're still talking about trust ? It 's amazing . I should shut the hell up , huh ? Look , it 's your career , Zane , and I will support any decision that you make . But if we are going to make it , we 've got to take care of our problems here on planet Earth , and that is just a little hard when you 're always off looking at the stars . Listening . Listening . Are we falling apart here ? Is that it , Char ? I don 't know , Zane . Are we ? How 'd you do on the test ? Pretty good . Yeah . - Yeah . No , I 'm saying it 's incomplete . There 's no chemical breakdown . There 's no broadband chart analysis . Do you want me to go on ? [ Man ] I 'm sorry that information isn 't available at this time . Well , look , this information was promised to me two months ago . Now , come on . These are not national secrets . This is a routine analysis of the atmosphere . So why should I have- - There 's a problem with that satellite . It 's blind to certain trace gases . Really ? As of when ? I believe it lost a solar panel . Some functions were shut down to save energy . Well , look . Here 's my problem . I 've devoted my sabbatical to greenhouse trace gases . So if I don 't get this data , I might as well be counting cow farts in Montana . Sorry , but you 'll have to wait until the new satellite is in place . Okay . When 's the launch date ? NASA doesn 't have that information . [ chuckles ] Round and round we go . Thanks for naught . [ phone ringing ] [ Man ] Moffett Field . Yo , Wyatt . Zane Zaminsky . How are you , man ? Oh , yeah , Zane . Hi . Look , I know you said you 'd get back to me , but I felt obligated to give you a call , let you know about a job offer that came up . Telecommunications . Looks pretty sweet , too . I mean , the health plan alone , you know ? Well , good . You should take it , Zane , because I don 't think things are going to work out here . Uh , but I- - I- - I thought you were looking for- - for radio astronomers , Bill . I- - I- - Some good creative thinkers . Isn 't that what you said ? I remember you saying that . Creative is one thing . Too creative is another . I 'm not- - I 'm not tracking . I 'm not sure I should be saying this , but I talked to Phil Gordian at JPL , and while he wouldn 't quite- - Well , the indication was- - Just say it . He said you were faking signals in order to keep your job . [ tires screech ] I do believe this permit 's expired , Zaminsky . Why haven 't you ? Zaminsky ! Zaminsky ! [ Man ] To raise the temperature of the planet tenfold . To change the atmosphere into one suitable to colonization . To construct farms , cities , and build an infrastructure capable of supporting thousands of colonists . Make no mistake about it . Never before have we undertaken a task- - ... have we undertaken a task of this size . The terraforming of Mars . Do you know where Phil Gordian is ? No . - Sorry . Excuse me , is Phil Gordian here ? No , uh-uh . Excuse me , have you seen Phil Gordian ? No . Well , somebody 's seen him . Damn it . Excuse me , but perhaps you 'd care to use the microphone . Yes . Yes , I would . Thanks . Phil Gordian- - has anybody seen him ? I 'm looking for Phil Gordian . Anybody seen Phil Gordian ? [ Phil ] The man was in the middle of a seminar , Zane . Why don 't we step outside and let him finish . Did you even give it to decoding ? Did you even see what was there ? Zane , why don 't we take this outside . If you 're not going to analyze it , I want my tape back . I want it back . I 'm sorry , I just- - I don 't know what you 're referring to . [ door opens ] Okay , we don 't you show me how smart you are by leaving right now . What 's going on , huh ? What are you doing this for ? Back it up . Back it up . Let 's go . Why are you telling them lies about me ? I said now . Let 's go . - Huh ? Why ? - Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go . - Why ? I 'm sorry . He 's a troubled young man . A very troubled young man . My apologies . Please continue . [ people murmuring ] So where was I ? Polar ice . Yes , after the polar ice has been melted , the atmosphere begins to grow thicker . Finally , a kind of critical mass is reached . And at this point , the atmosphere begins to work for us . [ phone rings ] Station 5 . [ Zane ] Tell me I 'm not losing my mind . Just tell me . [ Calvin ] Zane , uh , where are you ? They 're acting like it never happened . I just saw Gordy . It 's like we never gave him any tape . Uh , listen , Zane- - And then I remembered , it should still be on the backup DAT system . We should have a copy of the signal , right ? Well , uh , yes and no . Um , there are some DOD guys here , Zane , going through our stuff as we speak . Apparently , it was a burst from a spy satellite . What ? Yeah , Zane . It 's a defense thing , you know ? Which is probably why Gordian couldn 't tell us about it . You know , we weren 't cleared for this spy shit . Cal , Cal , listen to me very carefully . Satellites do not move like stars move . Now , we track this thing in sidereal time . In star time , okay ? Now , I don 't know who these guys are , but I do know that they 're lying to you . Is this everything ? Cal , if you haven 't told them about the backup system , don 't . We have it all ? Don 't you tell them , Cal . Don 't you dare ! Um , there , uh- - There 's a backup system . Hey . Uh , so if this was a spy bird , we was it moving like a star ? We 're not really sure . We 'll have to get back to you on that . It 's a very aggressive company . And with the federal mandate for airbags , they are perfectly positioned to dominate the market for years . Blade Co . Technologies . All right . I 'll send you a prospectus . Are you at the same address ? Uh , okay . Doug , can I call you back in , say , 10 minutes ? So I get this signal . How about 5 : 00 ? A signal from an F Class star . - 5 : 15 . Just like our sun , but a little hotter . First , they act like it 's nothing . - Great . Thanks . But now- - now they 're going to unimaginable pains to make it disappear . Zane , I thought you had a new job . Something 's going on here , Char . I mean , why the hell would they do that ? What is it that they 're trying to hide ? Maybe we could talk about this later . I need to talk about this now . I called last night , twice . I got the messages . I thought the problem was I wasn 't around enough . Now that I am , you 're not . What is this , Tales From the Dark Side ? I guess I have been avoiding this , yes . Okay . Define " this . " Zane , the brokerage is strongly suggesting that I head up the office in San Diego soon . It 'd mean moving there . Okay . Can you tell them no ? Oh , thank you , Zane . I tell you I 'll support any career decision that you make , but when it comes to me and my work- - You 're actually considering this ? Char , it 's Mr. Morgan on line 5 . And ? I got to take this . By any chance is he going to San Diego also ? Zane , why don 't you stick your paranoia back in your pants and get out of here ? I will call you . - Okay , fine . No problem . When ? Whenever I get to it . Tuesday , Wednesday , a.m. , p.m. ? Go ! Right now . They could be talking to us right now . [ crying ] [ laughing hysterically ] Hoo hoo ! [ sighing ] An array . Phased array . Good morning , Mr. Carbiener . I 'm Horace with your local satellite company . Good morning . [ speaking Spanish ] Can I see your dish ? What a glorious morning . Hot enough for you ? For a limited time , we 're offering a free upgrade on a totally automated fiber-optic control system . All this at no extra cost to you . No extra cost . No extra cost to you . One of the many ways which are improving the quality of service to our valued customers . Can I see your dish ? [ bubbling ] [ machines whirring ] [ typing ] [ wood creaking ] [ crack ] [ computer beeps ] Aah ! - Jesus . [ crash ] Ow . What are you doing here ? And how soon can you leave ? What are you doing here ? I live here . Do you mind ? I mind you grabbing on me . Let go . I 'm trying to help you down . I can do it myself . Aah , my foot is stuck . You live next door . Mrs. Roosevelt , is that it ? I live in L.A. Just kicking it here a minute . I don 't want anybody nosing around here . Hey , if I were going to steal your stuff , it would be over and done , okay ? Just what do you know about my stuff ? And what are you doing climbing roofs at 1 : 00 in the morning ? Shouldn 't you be out tagging freeway signs or something ? I don 't got to tell you shit . Fine , hang there all night . Hey ! Hey , where you going ? Get me down out of here . What are you doing ? I told you to wait downstairs . What 's this thing here ? A cooling jacket for a low noise amp . Don 't touch it . What 's that blinky shit over there ? Would you just sit down ? Put this on your ankle . I don 't want that thing . It 's cold . Just keep your butt down , your foot up , and your mouth shut . You can watch , but don 't touch anything . [ typing ] [ Boy ] So , what are all them dots ? They 're satellite dishes . Each one . You string enough of them together , it makes one big radio antenna , basically . But what 's it do ? It lets you get close to the stars . [ static ] See if you get 92.9 KBUMP . [ frequency ] [ high-pitched pinging ] Greetings from beyond the solar system . That , my friend , is Voyager 2 . What 's that ? Voyager is a planetary probe launched in the mid ' 70s . They don 't teach science in school anymore ? Too busy patting us down , seeing if we strapped . I assume you mean guns . They find one on you ? Not me , just everyone else . That 's how come the folks want me out of L.A. Crazy stuff going on . Can I come in now ? So this is the star , Wolf 336 . We 'll check the spectra at different magnifications , looking for anything unusual . [ sighs ] But unfortunately , all we find is the typical radio noise of an F Class star . But you talked to him before , huh ? The aliens . This channel . This star . This frequency . But we can 't really talk . You see , it takes years for a radio wave to get here . So all we can really do is just listen . But what 'd they say , before ? Maybe how to live forever . Maybe how to make nuclear power safe . I don 't know . Maybe they were just ordering out for a pizza . You see , we won 't really know what they 're saying . Not at first , but that doesn 't make it any less important . If I can confirm this signal , if we can find it again , then we will finally , finally know that we 're not alone . I wonder what they 're going to look like . [ lasers shooting ] [ Robotic voice ] Warning . Your sleep period is over . Get out of bed . Warning . Your sleep period is over . Get out of bed . Warning . Your sleep period is over . [ alarm stops ] Jesus . Going to try again ? Tonight ? If you are , I could wait up and sort of , you know , help some this time . You didn 't tell anybody about our little club house , did you ? What am I , new ? What about your grandma ? She doesn 't care if you stay up late at night ? Not after 10 : 00 . What happens at 10 : 00 ? She passes out on cough syrup . Tell you what . Whenever I 'm up there , you can come over . But only- - only if you got the proper ID . So where I get that at ? [ blows breath ] [ growls ] What about me , huh ? When can I do something ? Okay . Hit that key . What one ? - That one . This one here ? - Yes . Are you sure it 's okay ? I 'm sure it 's okay . This one right under my finger ? Give me your badge . You 're fired . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . So , what 's the signal going to look like ? Just a spike . A big one ? Or a little one ? Because I got a big one . [ high-pitched frequency , pulsing ] [ alien sounds ] [ typing ] That 's it . That 's exactly what Calvin and I saw . ¶ ¶ [ Spanish pop ] [ man speaking Spanish ] No , no , no . No , come back . [ dogs howling ] [ audio rewinding ] And I didn 't touch nothing , okay ? [ audio rewinding ] [ high-pitched frequency , pulsing ] It 's the same thing . Same signature , sameperiodicity- - ¶ ¶ [ Spanish pop ] What the hell is this ? What is that lambada shit ? It 's got to be a bounce . Radio wave that kicks off the inversion layer and then bleeds back in through this system . It 's coming from Earth ? [ man speaking Spanish ] Some Mexican radio station on the same frequency tells us where the bounce came from , but it doesn 't ... But it 's whack . All of it ? [ sighs ] Wait a sec . The first signal was defiantly sky-based . We verified it . But this one is Earth-based . Two identical signals . One comes from space , the other from Earth . I 'm all screwed up here . It doesn 't make any sense . Unless they 're talking . Hey , but last night , you were telling me how we couldn 't talk because it would take years . Cal . I got to talk to Cal . [ chatter ] [ Woman ] Somebody said something about a faulty heater . [ Man ] Carbon monoxide poisoning . [ Man # 2 ] Really ? [ police radio chatter ] [ Man ] You taking him down to County ? Yeah , sure . This guys DOA . [ respirator hissing ] [ sirens blaring ] [ Woman ] Okay , what have we got here ? Huge concentrations of trace gas here in Central Mexico , Ecuador , Brazil . Look , you can see for yourself . 700 % increase over the last 5 years ? How can that be ? My very question . Just how accurate is this data you sent us , Ilana ? Well , it 's hard to say . I mean , we cobbled it together from ground stations , weather balloons , Uncle Earl 's aching corns . Some of your own numbers are in there . No satellite data ? NASA 's bird has a bum wing . Well , you 've obviously got some ratty data . We checked this as best we could . George , run me a future cast , will ya ? Say , ten years , assuming the same increase . Of course . Well , it had be wrong , because according to this , we 're looking at an increase of 12 degrees Centigrade over the next decade . And that 's just- - Catastrophic . Well , I was going to say impossible , but , yep , that , too . Central Mexico . [ crowd chatter ] [ speaking Spanish ] Uh , excuse me . You come to see the ruins , my friend ? I take you to some much very good places . [ sighs ] No , let 's just head for town . When does it start to cool off down here ? In San Marsol ? Hah . This is cooler . ¶ ¶ [ Spanish ] [ static ] This dial right ? Right , left , both ways . This radio station , you know where this is ? Oh , very far . Not close to town . Let 's go there . How about the ruins ? You want to see the ruins , my friend ? The radio station . I need to go there . I 'm going to talk to the people . [ chatter ] Accidente , esse . But no persons was here- - gracias a Dios- - when the fire come last night . Too late . ¿ Como ? One day too late . Posada San Marsol . One of our much very best hotels . Uh-huh . Señora , you see those things ? ¿ Como ? These TV dishes , allí y allí . You know of any big ones ? Big ? - Yeah , big . Not small like these , but- - but big . 50 , 60 feet wide . Big . Grande . - Oh , no . Nada big in San Marsol . Nada . ¶ ¶ [ Spanish ballad ] [ static ] [ pipes flushing ] [ rhythmic thudding ] [ water running ] [ metal squeaking ] One of our very much best hotels . [ beep ] This is Peter Dowling from Sierra Satellite . Just wondering if you were sick or dead or something . Because if you 're not , you 're fired . Sorry , pal . [ hangs up ] [ dial tone ] [ beep ] Yes , Zane . Uh , this is Doug . I heard about you and Char . I heard it was skidsville , and I 'm sorry to hear that . I know what it feels like . If you want to get together anytime , you know , let 's do it . We 'll talk it through . I 'm there for you man , okay ? Oh , and , uh , would you mind if I got her number ? You know , I- - I just want to talk to her about some investment possibilities . All right ? Thanks . [ hangs up ] [ dial tone ] [ beep ] [ Char ] I called this morning . Just didn 't leave a message . Are you there now ? Well , I guess I didn 't get back to you that night because I was mad , Zane . I get so tired of being questioned about even the basic things , and maybe I was feeling some guilt , too , for steering you away from what you should be doing , from what you love the most . But you were such an ass the last time we talked , I- - Damn , I can 't remember if this machine lets you ramble , so I 'd better just admit this quick . I miss your weird and paranoid brain . [ laughs ] Call when you can . Where are you , Zane ? [ hangs up ] [ dial tone ] [ beep ] [ floorboard groaning ] [ cracking ] [ screaming ] [ screaming louder ] [ gasps ] Move ! [ panting ] Just who the hell are you , huh ? Because I saw you in town . I saw you at the airport . You were waiting for me . You knew , didn 't you ? [ men speaking Spanish ] [ bones crunch ] How the ... [ beeping ] Where do you hide a 20-meter dish ? [ static ] [ Ilana speaking Spanish ] [ clattering ] [ both speaking Spanish ] Sir . No , no . [ speaking Spanish ] [ Officer speaking Spanish ] [ Ilana ] No . No . [ both speaking Spanish ] Jesus ! Hey ! Excuse me . Excuse me . What 's going on here ? I don 't know . These guys are stealing my stuff . They 're taking my equipment . I was trying to work here . Señor , excuse me . Hey , hey ! - What ? [ speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] Hey , take it easy . Will you guys take it easy ? Whoa ! Hey ! What ? Oh ! No , no . [ all speaking Spanish ] [ starts engine ] Well , I know I should say thanks , but that was a pretty dicey stunt you pulled back there . You could have got us both shot . You 're welcome , and you 're right . Saw you in town last night , didn 't I ? Zane Zaminsky . Am I still bleeding ? Yeah , a little . Ilana Green . Damn , it 's hot in here . You 'd think they 'd have air-conditioning in this place . I don 't like blood . So why were they rousting you , anyways ? Something about my gear they don 't like . What is all that stuff ? It 's technical . Because it looks like some kind of radiosonde for atmospheric sampling . That 's right . That 's absolutely right . Just who are you ? Can I ask what I 've done wrong ? I wish to apologize to you both . We have overreacted in this matter . As for the equipment , it seems to be ruined . If you give me a local number- - Wait a second . Why was I detained ? Why did these men take my gear in the first place ? You were on private land . But isn 't this a public facility ? Please try to understand this is a new type of power station . And with new technology come those who would like to steal it . You 're staying at San Marsol , yes ? [ Ilana ] What do you mean " new type " ? You still burn fossil fuels , right ? [ Woman ] With great efficiency . Very few emissions . [ Ilana ] What kind of emissions ? I 'm not an expert in this matter like yourself . Perhaps if you were to leave me a local number- - Yeah , perhaps if you give me- - No , no , no . Call it a push . Come on . [ Ilana ] They say there 's a twin for everyone in the world . [ Zane ] No , that 's not it . Look , you roll the genetic dice often enough , they 're going to land on top of each other . Trust me , Ilana . That is not it . Nice of them to bring our cars here . Follow me back to town , and don 't make any stops , all right ? [ beeps ] I understand you do residential work . I 've got a little weeding problem I 'm hoping you can help me with . It 's really a very small job . There 's the address . [ motor buzzing ] [ robotic sounds ] [ Ilana ] We saw Gulf hurricanes in March . Right now there 's a drought in the Sudan killing thousands . So we 're talking global warming , right ? Yes and no . Yes in that we 're showing an increase in global temperature over the last decade . It 's not much , but if you factor out the cooling effects of volcanic activity- - It 's happening . Our factories can 't pump out 7 billion tons of CO2 a year and not do damage . This is the Arctic ? - Yeah . 90 miles from the pole . Well , what 's it doing there ? Taken by itself , it 's just another anomaly . But as a whole , we see the Arctic is incredibly sensitive to environmental change . That 's why we go there , because things happen first in the Arctic . It 's like a window on the future . So you 're talking about something a lot bigger than global warming . I see some major climatic ordeal happing . [ chuckles ] Oh , God . I get so damned apocalyptic when I drink . But you have to remember every major turning point on this planet , including the demise of the dinosaur , began in a shift in climate . Even a 10-degree increase will melt 70 % of the polar ice cap . Wipe out all agriculture . Raise the temperature of the planet to change its atmosphere into one suitable to colonization . Terraforming . What is that ? This guy at JPL , he 's been giving talks about Mars and how its whole environment could be changed and how we could terraform it and then live there . It 'll never happen , of course . Cost hundreds of billions . But he did say something about- - After the polar ice has been melted , the atmosphere again grows thicker . Finally , a kind of critical mass is reached . What ? I don 't know . We might give a call if it 's not not too- - Jesus , I did the time warp dance here . Well , before I go around saying the sky is falling or even warming , I 've got to get new gear from NCAR . When do you leave ? First thing in the morning . You ? I don 't know , yet . Still haven 't seen everything I need to see . Maybe a couple of days . You know , I must say , Zane , I really enjoyed our talk tonight . It 's uncommon for me to find someone who can actually grasp the things that I 'm passionate about . Yeah , I hear ya . So , where are you staying ? Well , I was in room 302 at the big pink place until merged with room 402 . What ? Some kind of an accident ? Everything is lately . How is this dump ? Well , it 's not bad with the lights off . Maybe I 'll get a room . Well , look , I 'm gone first thing in the morning . Why don 't you just stay here now and keep the room tomorrow ? You mean , share it ? Well , there is a couch . We could at least keep the appearance of respectability . Uh , yeah , I suppose we could . And not that I don 't find the proposition intriguing or anything . And not that you just propositioned me . Did you ? Boy , Zane , that 's a lot of guilt for somebody who hasn 't done anything , yet . I take it there 's a warm body in bed at home ? Not in my bed , still in my head . I don 't know . I guess there 's still something to be said for abstinence . You think ? In moderation . Terraforming . If you find anything , get it to me , care of UCLA . I will . Oh , Ilana . What ? Yes . Just- - Just be careful . Change for the phone . Cambio . [ groans ] [ turns on faucet ] Man , it was good to hear your voice . [ Char ] Zane . Look , I 'm really sorry about before , but , like , I tried to- - No , no , no . No . You 're right . I was a complete asshole . And we will get back to that , but you still get downloads at home , right ? Stock stuff ? Yeah , but- - Planecorp Industries . Check it out for me , will ya ? Slow modem , still waiting . So when are you coming home , Zane ? I 'm not exactly s- - Who said I was gone ? I stopped by yesterday and the papers were stacking up , so I put them inside . Okay , here we go . Ticker PLC , Planecorp Industries , a leader in clean air technology . Blah , blah , blah . Looks just like they buy up old power utilities , overhaul , and put them back online . Ecuador , Peru , three faculties in Mexico . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Back up . There 's more than one plant ? Mm-mm . As of January 1st , they have 8 facilities online and 12 more planned , all in Third World countries . 20 plants ? Where 's all the money coming from ? American investors . Your mutual funds at work . Wow . Well , thanks- - thanks for the help , Char . Wha- - What ? That 's it ? After four weeks , you call me up for a stock report ? I- - I don 't know what else to say . How about " I miss you " ? [ sighs ] I shouldn 't have to say it . [ gasps ] If that 's it ... How big does that make the- - [ ground rumbling ] [ poles rattling ] My God . [ alien sounds ] Aah ! [ vehicle approaching ] [ speaking Spanish ] Go . [ speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ elevator activating ] [ droning ] [ bones crack ] [ bones cracking ] Aah ! Aah ! Uh ! [ groans ] [ rumbling ] [ gears clanking ] [ sirens blaring ] [ alarms blaring ] [ speaking alien language ] [ speaking alien language ] [ speaks alien language ] [ churning ] [ speaking alien language ] No . [ bubbling ] [ speaking alien language ] Do you want to see the ruins , my friend ? [ screams ] [ panting ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ screaming ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ branches rustle ] [ screams ] [ groaning ] [ hissing ] [ Man ] Mr. Zaminsky , we got you speeding on the wrong side of the road . Then you said you were in the cantina last night with , uh , - Señorita What 's-Her-Name . Green , Ilana Green . Green . Right . I suppose you were drinking . Oh , we had a couple of beers , big deal . That has nothing to do with- - This week is El Día de los Muertos- - the Day of the Dead . Yeah ? So what ? As an American , you 're not too familiar with all these costumes , with all these things we see all around . Uh-uh . Wrong . What I saw was no costume , was no papier-mâché skeleton . It was nothing like that- - [ speaks Spanish ] The captain of security for the power station has called to report an accident . That a man , intoxicated , had killed someone with this car last night . An American man . No . That- - That- - That is not what happened . That is to say you were involved . They are lying ! It 's up to me to decide who 's lying . That 's why I make the questions and that 's why you give me answers . Now , again . Were you involved in this ? I hit something with the car . Now , who it was or what it was , I 'm not sure . But if they 're saying that I killed someone , I want to see it . Bring the body here . I demand to see it ! There 's no need to demand that , Mr. Zaminsky . That 's just exactly what they 're doing . Don 't go anywhere . [ men speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] No , no . Our word for an " attorney " is " abogado . " I suggest you- - [ panting ] [ people speaking Spanish ] [ Newscaster ] Mercury peaks at around 99 degrees today . And , yes , that will be a record for this day in October . But nowhere is it hotter right now than in the hallways of NASA , where officials are still trying to explain what happened yesterday to that atmospheric satellite that blew up just 32 seconds after launch . Press conference now under way at JPL in Pasadena . [ Zane ] Anybody going to lose their job over this , Mr. Gordian ? Sorry , I 'm really not the right- - Zane ? You don 't look too good . Actually , I look like a can of smashed assholes . Here 's a tip . If you ever get the chance to travel with a Mexican rodeo , pass . Look , Zane , about before , I 'm , uh- - I 'm sorry . DOD was putting a lot pressure on me to keep a lid on things . Then you started asking questions in front of all those people . No , no , no , no . Forget it . No hard feelings . I just wanted to drop by and pay you a visit . Check up on my old buddy Gordy . Maybe see what 's really what , who 's really who . I tell you , Zane , you 're really not making very much sense . Maybe we should walk over to the infirmary . It didn 't make a lot of sense to me , either , the first time I saw your face on another guy . Genetic dice ? Uh , no , no . I don 't think so . I think somebody just screwed up . As good as you are , you do make mistakes , don 't you ? You should have broke the mold , Gordy . What do you want , Zane ? What do I want ? I want to blow a hole in your head and donate your organs to science . But there are a few things I need to know first . [ sighs ] Fucking NRA . It 's just so easy to get one . Let 's have a chat . Yeah , okay . Media center . Looks like somebody stole some camera gear . You want it ? A real crime . Okay , somebody 's on the way . So who was targeted ? Anyone in SETI ? Well , not anyone . Who then ? Look in the mirror . Prime intellect . Non-conformist reasoning . Capacity for lateral thinking . Isn 't that what you see ? And then what ? A control is assigned ? Somebody like you ? Could I , uh , actually see this gun of yours , Zane ? Oh , sure . But if I pull it out , Gordy , it 'll be the last thing you ever see . Well , I , uh- - I think it 's possible to say that you 've been watched for quite a while now . So which programs besides SETI ? NASA ? Ask yourself why an antenna won 't deploy on a deep-space probe . Or ask how they could launch a $ 6 billion telescope without testing its mirror . So what you 're actually saying- - I 'm saying nothing . I 'm just listening to you ask questions . Then I 'll ask about Planecorp . Planecorp ? Sorry , I don 't know what that is . You know , it 's that factory down in Mexico . It 's outside my knowledge . 1 of 20 being built in Third-World countries . Outside- - - Where there 's no laws to protect the air . Outside my knowledge . You build where it 's hot . Because you like it hot , Gordy , don 't you ? Zane , if you force me to answer you , what you will be hearing is your own death sentence . Because right now , as much as you think you know , you don 't know the half of it . Right now , you 're just one little guy with a big conspiracy theory and no proof , and the world is full of them . So Zane , you take great care in what else you choose to learn . They 're terraform factories , aren 't they ? Yes . You 're pumping out greenhouse gas . And now you 're dead . Your changing the air , the temperature , the whole ecosystem . We 're just finishing what you started . What would have taken you 100 years , we 'll do in 10 . Just speeding along your own demise . Like you sped Calvin along . And Ilana Green , right ? If you can 't tend to your own planet , none of you deserve to live here . Bang . You 're dead . Don 't tell me that 's who I think it is . Do we have a problem here ? No . No . No problem . [ sighs ] I 'm going to handle this myself . Jeez ! Zane ? What are you doing out here like this- - Who 's been here ? Anyone ? Anybody watching my house ? Uh-uh . Nobody I 've seen . I can 't believe they wouldn 't be . Kiki , I 'm going to say something that 's going to sound completely insane . But I 'm telling you because I think you might actually believe me . I 'm also telling you because I can 't be the only one who knows , in case they ... find me before I finish this . Well , tell me . You know how I followed the signal down to Mexico because we thought somebody was- - Yeah , yeah , yeah . [ sighs ] They weren 't us , Kiki . Well , so what was they ? So do they got these little flashlight fingers that , uh- - So maybe they got these big metal teeth that come out and sort of- - Well , what does they look like then ? Like you . Like me . Like anyone . Then what they doing here ? I 'll show you . I 'll show everyone . Soon as I fire up the array . Shit . You been evicted . I got to get out to Oro Valley . Out to the big dish . Hold this . Don 't drop it . What game does it play ? Man , where 's the start button ? [ car approaches ] [ car door closes ] Char . Zane . You going to let me in ? Who 's Char ? I can 't stay . If they 're not here now , they will be soon . Who , Zane ? The police ? What about the police ? Well , they came to my work , Zane . Some detective . He said something about manslaughter charges in Mexico . You 're a fugitive ? Ooh , that 's fat . The whole thing was fabricated . They set me up . I-I don 't understand , Zane . Why would the police want to- - Not the police . It was them . Them . Who 's them ? Forget it . Probably the aliens . Who is this child ? And does he mean illegal aliens , Zane ? I hope . I 'll take you car . Give me that . No , no . No , you won 't . Not until I know what is going on here . Look . It sounds nuts , but I know what I saw . I know why they 're here . I know about the poppy field in the Arctic . Their whole master plan about the air and the- - Give me the keys . I can 't let you go , Zane . Not alone , not like this . You don 't have to come . I wouldn 't believe me , either , unless I 'd seen for myself . But , Char , I must leave now . You think I 'm letting you out of my sight ? Yeah , you are nuts . Can I come ? Can I come ? [ Zane ] Get off me ! This isn 't a field trip . I left my grandma a note . I want to come . I want to help . [ Zane ] Drive ! Pull over at the onramp . I 'll drive . I got shotgun . Zane , I think that you 've got to deal with this . You know , somehow . If it means both of us going to the police and just explaining- - I can 't get stuck in some jail . Not now . Please , pull over . All right , we 're here . Now what do you hope to accomplish ? Keys . Keys . Keys . Where 's Char ? What are you doing ? Getting my stuff out of the car . Is that all right ? I just- - The strangest thoughts . Kiki , if it says " power , " you push it . These monitors . This stuff here . Light it up , everything . Find Omni Star 5 . I 'll need two sets of coordinates- - right ascension and declination . Zane , I don 't see how listening to some star is- - It 's not a star . And this time , we 're talking , not listening . [ sighs ] [ engine roars ] So , this is some kind of satellite in orbit ? It 's a co-op weather satellite . [ typing ] One that about 50 TV stations pull a continuous feed off of . 100,000 watts ought to get their attention . And they 'll understand what all this means ? We 're gonna find out , right now . [ beeping ] [ electrical crackle ] [ clacking ] Shit . What is it ? What 's happening ? [ clacking ] What 's wrong with this thing ? [ scoffs ] Gardening . I didn 't see any gardens around here , Zane . What are they doing here , Char ? Like I should know . You made a call . From the car . Zane , when you start talking about aliens and master plans , and then this woman being killed in Mexico- - Did I mention that it was a woman ? The pol- - The police told me , okay ? Ah ! And that 's who you called , right , Char ? You called the police . Yes , it is . You were scaring me with your talk . You 're scaring me now , the way you 're- - As soon as I left SETI , you left . As soon as I got back from Mexico , there you were , waiting for me . Because I thought you might need me , Zane . Like I needed all that career advice ? The gentle persuasion ? The little nudges about how I was wasting my life ? I- - - [ footsteps approach ] Aah ! [ grunting ] [ screaming ] [ screeching ] Cold . Too cold . [ vans approaching ] I 'm sorry . I am just so sorry . I didn 't believe about- - You 've got to trust me when I say that I only called the police , and only because I wanted- - Then what are they doing here , Char ? Who told them to find me here ? I don 't know . I honestly do not know . Kiki . Watch this screen . When you see my face , I want you to hit the red key right there . The one right next to you . The transmit key . Heh-hey , you ain 't leaving me here , are you ? Don 't worry . They 'll be chasing us . We 're gonna give this one more shot . Go . No , no , no . It 's this way . Go . [ speaking indistinctly ] [ car engine starts ] [ keys jingling ] Give it . Give me the chain . You can move the dish from here , right ? So go . I can do this . Zane , for once in your paranoid life , would you please just trust me ? [ glass breaking ] Now , Kiki . Now , Kiki ! Hit it now ! Kiki , the red transmit key . Hit it now . Kiki , for shit 's sake , hit it now ! Now ! Now ! Hit it now ! Like I said , Zane ... you didn 't know the half of it . Zane , what happened ? Why did they leave ? They didn 't . How do you know ? Because we aren 't dead yet . Help me . [ grunts ] Move ! [ screeching ] [ clanging ] [ hisses ] - [ gasps ] Zane , c-can we get out of here now ? Not that way . I 'll be right behind you . [ mechanical droning ] [ gasps ] Not ... so ... fast . [ grunts ] Zane ! Aah ! Aah ! [ metal groaning ] [ gasping ] [ screaming ] [ panting ] [ thumping ] Oh , please . Oh , please . Please . [ thumping continues ] [ grunting ] Why did it have to be like this ? Why couldn 't you just come and ask for our help ? Then you tell them . You go back and tell them that I know . That she knows . That others will know . It 's not gonna be easy . Not anymore . [ bones cracking ] Summer is just refusing to go away . Record highs again in the Big Apple , while New England states are reporting a delay of the fall foliage season . In fact , it 's been warmer than normal up and down the entire Eastern seaboard . They 're terraform factories , aren 't they ? Yes . You 're pumping out greenhouse gas . Now you 're dead . You 're changing the air , the temperature , the whole ecosystem . We 're just finishing what you started . What would 've taken you 100 years , we 'll do in 10 . Just speeding along your own demise . Like you sped Calvin along . And Ilana Green , right ? If you can 't tend to your own planet , none of you deserve to live here . Closed-Captioned By Burbank , CAServices , Inc .

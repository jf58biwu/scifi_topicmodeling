 First Officer 's Personal Log , Stardate 49005.3 . The Captain has granted me the use of a shuttlecraft so that I may perform the pakra ... a solitary ritual commemorating the anniversary of my father 's death . A-koo-chee-moya . I pray on this day of memories to speak to my father ... the one whom the wind called ... Kolopak . Though I am far from his bones , perhaps there is a spirit in these unnamed skies who will find him and honor him with my song . A-koo-chee-moya . There . You see ? We should teach them the price of displaying their markings in our space . I 'll go . Let Kar do it this time . He 's not ready . He thinks he is . He 's been demanding a chance for weeks to earn his name . Do you really believe he could do this ? Can you honestly say you knew you were ready for your first mission , Haliz ? Tell him . Tell him today is the day he will finally be called Ogla . Computer , report . The shuttlecraft has sustained phaser fire . Minor damage to aft shields . Source ? A Kazon spacecraft , closing at 195 , mark 6 . Computer , open a channel to the Kazon vessel . This is Commander Chakotay of the Federation Starship Voyager . Why have you fired on me ? You are in Kazon-Ogla space , Federation . I wasn 't aware of that . I have no hostile intentions . Power down your weapons and I 'll leave . No one who violates Ogla space leaves . Look , son , my starship is only a few light-years away . I am not your son , Federation . I am your executioner . Chakotay to Kazon vessel . Listen carefully . I do not want a fight . Stand down , or I 'll be forced to return fire . Chakotay to Kazon vessel . I have established a direct weapons lock on your engine core . This is my final warning . If you don 't stand down , I will destroy your ship . All right . If that 's the way you want to play it . Chakotay to Kazon vessel . Do you read me ? Computer , are there any life signs inside the Kazon vessel ? Affirmative . One life sign . Kazon ship , your engine core is critical . You have less than 30 seconds to evacuate . Do you read me ? If you have an escape pod , you must eject now . Computer , establish a transporter lock on the life-form . Acknowledged . Targeting scanners . Prepare to beam him aboard . Scanners locked . Energize . Chakotay to Voyager . Chakotay to Voyager . Computer , damage report . Long-range communications , lateral sensor array and aft shields are off-line . Great ! Welcome aboard . It 's not that I feel that I 'm not making contributions as chef and morale officer . You 're making significant contributions , Neelix . Well , if you insist , but ... I can 't imagine how Lieutenant Ayala would be handling the separation from his children without you . He misses his boys terribly . I wish I could do more for him . And your meals are getting to be ... Yes ? Almost certainly ... a highlight of every day . Oh , Captain ! You always know how to touch one 's heart . Thank you . When I signed on , I promised you that ... I promised you that I would stand by your side through every danger this Quadrant has to offer ... as guide , as strategist , as explorer , as adventurer ... Yes ? I feel ... under-utilized . I can swashbuckle with the best of them . You weren 't invited to the holodeck defense simulations , were you ? No ! Captain , you are needed on the Bridge . On my way . I 'll see to it you 're invited next time . And now , Mr. Neelix , please ... join me on the Bridge . Yes , sir . Ma 'am ... Captain . We are ready to depart . However , Commander Chakotay has still not returned . Have you tried hailing him ? On all frequencies . No response . When was the last time we heard from him ? More than six hours ago . Well , according to his flight plan , he 's not far . We 'll just have to go get him . I want all away teams back on board now . Mr. Paris , plot a course for Chakotay 's last known coordinates . Aye , Captain . What am I doing here ? You 're welcome . What ? It 's a human expression . You thank me for saving your life , I say , " You 're welcome . " I accept your surrender . Look ! I promise you , as soon as we get back to Voyager , we 'll find a Kazon ship and hand you over to them . You should have let me die . I 'm not in the habit of killing children . Warning . Alien vessel approaching at 022 mark 8 . What 's your name , son ? What ? Your name ? Why do you want to know my name ? I want to let them know you 're on board . I 'm called Kar . Computer , open a channel . Kazon vessel , I have a young man on board you might know . He goes by the name of Kar . I 'd say he 's about 13 . I 'd like to arrange for his transfer before I return to my ship . Computer , confirm channel is open . Confirmed . Transmission has been received . Talk to them . Tell them you 're okay . Warning . Kazon vessel has engaged a tractor beam . Full reverse . Unable to comply . Tractor force exceeds available engine power . They 're pulling us in . Kill me . Please ! Why are you so eager for me to kill you ? Because there are worse things than being killed by your enemy . Look , if you check your long-range sensors , you 'll find a big ship out there . It 's called Voyager , and by now , it 's on its way to find me . Kar . I told Razik you weren 't ready . I have a fair idea of why I 'm here , but why are they doing this to you ? I was ready , Haliz . Ready to kill or die . I felt the flames touch my skin . Go back in , Kar . It was this fool ... this ... Federation , who doesn 't even have the courage to kill his enemies . He pulled me out with that transporter we 've heard about . Like the Nistrim and the Relora before you ... you come into our space , showing off your uniforms and displaying the markings of your ... Federation with no respect , as if you own this part of space . But it belongs to us ! I tried to kill him , Haliz ! I want to see Razik . Tell Razik I demand to see him . Who 's Razik ? You tell this Razik that Federation Commander Chakotay demands to see him . What are you doing ? Razik is obviously your leader . I 'm hoping if he 's strong enough to be in command , he 's wise enough to listen to reason . You see this ? This is debris from a Nistrim frigate . The man you are demanding to see destroyed it , killing more than 100 in a single shot . Before that , his name was only Ra . Now he is called Jal Razik . And this tunic belonged to a Relora warrior . He was killed by the bare hands of another Ogla , called only Hali . Now that man is called Jal Haliz , one of our greatest fighters . And this bracelet belonged to the man who killed my brother . My brother , Jal Kinell ... who earned his Ogla name by dying bravely in battle . But I ... I will never earn my name in life or in death , and I have you to thank for that . We 're approaching Chakotay 's last known coordinates , Captain . All stop . Full sensor scan , Mr. Kim . I 'm picking up floating debris composed of duranium , magnesite and electroceramics . Also heavy traces of carbon residue . Bridge to Engineering . Prepare to receive debris samples for analysis . Aye , Captain . Transport complete . Captain , I am detecting an ion trail leading away from this location . Chakotay 's shuttle ? The signature of the radiation is not consistent with Federation propulsion systems . So what are we saying here ? That someone blew up Chakotay 's shuttle and then took off ? That 's speculation , Mr. Paris , but that trail 's the only clue we have to Chakotay 's whereabouts . Laying in a course . Engage . Hello , Kar . I never thought I would see you like this . It was not my fault . It was his technology . Don 't make excuses , Kar . An Ogla has no room for excuses . No . No excuses . I forgive you . Know that in your heart . No , please ... You will eat at my right hand tonight . Why did you save him ? It 's a very ineffective way of waging war . I 'm not at war with you . I wish I could say the same . We 're not familiar with this part of space . If I 'd seen a map identifying this as Kazon-Ogla territory , I wouldn 't have been anywhere near it . Unfortunately , our territorial claims change every day . Maps do not serve us well . You did him a great disservice , you know . I guess if he had killed me , my uniform would have made you all a fine trophy . Your uniform may yet decorate our wall . You may not think you 're at war with us , Federation Commander Chakotay , but everything you are is a threat to us . The Kazon fought long and hard for their independence from uniforms like yours . Uniforms , maybe , but not like mine . Your uniforms , your laws , your technology . You are not welcome here . Get him something to eat . The execution is tonight . Well ? Most of the debris we 've examined is composed of a polyduranide alloy , which isn 't used in the construction of Federation spacecraft . So it wasn 't Chakotay 's shuttle that was destroyed . This ship was Kazon . You get them involved young , Haliz . As soon as they 're old enough to protect their younger siblings . So they brought you here to see your first human . Take a good look ... you won 't see any hate in my eyes . I 'm a gentle man from a gentle people who wish you no harm . That 's enough ! I know you 'd like them to hate me , Razik , but I want their first impression of humans to be a good one . You 've been brought here to learn what it means to be a Kazon male . You all know Kar . You 've learned to fight together , haven 't you ? Kar was sent to kill this man to earn his Ogla name , but Kar failed and will not earn his name even in death . Who would be willing to kill the human ? So much for first impressions , Federation . I 'm proud of you . Each will get your chance someday . But that 's not what we 're here for today . We are here to learn the price of failure in battle . Take it . What for ? So that you can kill Kar as you should have done in battle . You want me to kill a child in front of other children . What would it accomplish ? It will teach these little boys an important lesson . And after you do that , you 'll be free to go . You may think I want your friend Kar to die , but you 'd be wrong . I 've seen too many Ogla die at the hands of our enemies . That is why you must learn there are no second chances in battle . That is why Kar must die . If I refuse ? I 'll be needing my shuttle back . Do you really think you can escape us in that little vessel of yours ? That 's a chance I 'm willing to take . What about you ? Let the coward run . Prepare his shuttle . Want to come ? There doesn 't seem to be much of a future for you here . He 'd rather die than run like a Calogan dog with you , Federation . If I stay here , I 'll die without a name , and Razik taught me only cowards die without a name . You won 't find your name running after the Federation , Kar . Maybe not . But that 's a chance I 'm willing to take . I 'll show you how to disable the weapon systems . Will Razik be all right ? Don 't worry . He 's only stunned . Didn 't take them long to get those weapons back on line , did it ? Computer , prepare to go to warp . No . Their ship is much clumsier at lower speeds . We should try to outmaneuver them . You 're the boss . Initiate evasive pattern theta two , full impulse . I can give you the shield frequencies of their ship . We could hit them back easily . It may mean something to you to die a violent death , but I 'd like to get out of this without killing or being killed . You 'd rather die in your sleep , a wrinkled old man ? Sounds about right . Computer , damage report . Aft shields at 63 percent . We 're not going to make it like this . Computer , scan for an M-Class atmosphere . There is an M-Class moon at bearing 108 , mark 18 . Distance 1.9 million kilometers . That 's Tarok , where the Ogla conduct training exercises . Anybody training there now ? Computer , lay in a course to the moon . Evasive pattern omega one . Maximum impulse . Warning . Aft shields have been penetrated . Hull breach is imminent . Computer , prepare for long-range transport . Two to beam to the surface . Transport is not recommended . The moon is out of safety range . Captain , the ion trail is beginning to dissipate . All stop . I 'm picking up debris again . More duranium , magnesite , carbon residue ... It 's the remnants of another ship . Bridge to Engineering . Lieutenant Torres , prepare to receive another debris sample . Acknowledged . Transport underway . Torres to Bridge . Sample received . Let me know when you 've got something , B 'Elanna . I 've got something right now . It 's a piece of Chakotay 's shuttle . Kar ... It worked ? The computer said that transport wasn 't recommended . Didn 't say it was impossible . With any luck , Razik will think we didn 't survive the explosion . Then maybe you 'll get your name for dying in battle . In battle ? ! That wasn 't a battle ! We didn 't even shoot back . And now , I 'm stranded here . With you . Yes , you 're stranded here with me . And I 'm stranded here with you , because for some reason that escapes me at the moment , I keep saving your life . Now if you want to hate me for that , fine , but I 'd really appreciate it if you kept it to yourself . - You ... - To yourself ! First thing we 've got to do is find some shelter and get out of this heat . Any suggestions ? I think we 're finally beginning to understand each other . You don 't know what you 're doing . What did I just say ? Get down . What the hell was that ? A proton beam . They 're hidden everywhere , along with biomagnetic traps and disrupter snares . Charming . I told you . The Ogla train on this moon . I was here myself last year with Razik . So I guess you know your way around . I know that you 're in my territory , and if you want to live to become that wrinkled old man , you 're going to have to do what I say . Well , it looks like you just saved my life . Twice more and we 'll be even . I finished analyzing the shuttle debris and I found no evidence of human remains . Then it 's possible Chakotay wasn 't killed in the explosion . That is correct . That 's the first good news I 've heard all day . Thank you , Doctor . My pleasure . Now , would you mind having someone transport this junk to the cargo bay ? It 's cluttering up my lab . Of course , Doctor . All right then , if Commander Chakotay wasn 't in the shuttle , where is he ? From the dispersal pattern of the debris , we 've been able to extrapolate Chakotay 's course prior to the explosion . It appears he was heading for an M-Class moon in this system . And we found a residual energy displacement within the debris field that isn 't consistent with the explosion itself . You think he may have transported to that moon . We tried to scan the surface , but there is intense radiothermic interference . Radiothermic ? It appears to be coming from subterranean energy sources ... several carefully concealed weapon systems ... phaser banks , force fields , proton dischargers . Kazon . When they captured me , I saw how they concealed their weaponry . I believe you call them " booby traps . " Then this moon is some kind of Kazon fortification . Or it may simply be a training site . For the Kazon , live ammunition is a very effective teaching tool . In the absence of evidence to the contrary I choose to believe Chakotay made it to that moon . Mr. Kim , see if you can determine the most probable location he would 've beamed to . Lieutenant , you and I will lead the away team . As you wish , Captain , but I must point out that due to radiothermic interference , we will not be able to communicate with the ship . I 'm already working on a dampening field to cut through the interference , but it 'll take several hours at least . I don 't want to wait that long , but keep trying . Neelix , Kes , you are our two Kazon experts . Kes , you 'll come with Tuvok and me . Neelix , you said you wanted more to do . Well , now 's your chance . I want you on the Bridge with Mr. Paris , in case we run into any Kazon ships . Don 't worry , Captain . You can count on me to keep those nefarious Kazon at bay . Dismissed . What are you doing ? I 'm setting my tricorder to emit a homing signal . What for ? So when my people show up , they 'll know where to look for me . They won 't come . They 'll think you 're dead . They 're very persistent . I 'm betting they haven 't given up on me . Well , maybe I should kill you and steal your technology and deliver it to my people . Then they 'd have to give me my name . You just won 't give up , will you ? You won 't stop me from earning my name , Federation . Not Federation ... Chakotay . That 's my name . Did you have to earn it ? No , not exactly . Then your name means nothing . My name was a gift ... from my tribe . I cherish it every day of my life . Just as I cherish the Federation uniform . I should respect you because you wear that uniform . Your name , my uniform ... not much difference . We both have to earn them . What did you have to do to earn your uniform ? Study . Years of study . Learning about science and ships and navigation . I suppose they don 't expect you to prove your battle skills . No . They prepared us to defend ourselves in battle . They prepared us very well , and we had to pass many difficult tests before we were given the right to wear the uniform . You 're saying that my name and your uniform mean the same thing . But you 're wrong . Why ? What 's so different about us ? Aside from the fact that I keep saving your life , and you keep threatening to kill me ? I must protect my territory . Territory is power . Let me tell you something . I have no interest in your territory or anybody else 's . My people taught me a man does not own land . He doesn 't own anything but the courage and loyalty in his heart . That 's where my power comes from . I think we both could use some sleep , don 't you ? I 've got a Kazon raider approaching at bearing 288 mark 9 . On screen . Open a channel . I 'm Lieutenant Tom Paris of the Starship Voyager . Jal Razik , first maje of the Kazon-Ogla . I will speak to your Captain . I 'm in command right now , so you can speak to me . You are trespassing in Ogla space . Why do you orbit our moon ? Just stopped to make a few repairs . We 'll be on our way in no time . That is a lie . You are here looking for your Commander Chakotay . Now , how would you know about that ? Quite simply . We killed him . Under what circumstances ? He kidnapped a young man . During his escape , it became necessary to destroy his ship . No doubt you 've found the remains . So I suggest you depart immediately . Thanks for the advice . What a most unusual offer . A Kazon-Ogla maje allowing a trespasser to leave his space unharmed . What would the other Kazon say about this new merciful attitude of the Ogla ? Don 't tempt me , Talaxian . I would just as soon open fire . Would you ? Neelix ... No , I don 't think so . That would attract every rival Kazon sect to your secret training base , wouldn 't it ? Now , I know your ships , Maje . I even sold a few Plaxan sensors to the Ogla a few years back . I have no doubt that you read the same life signs on that moon that we have . Perhaps one of those life signs belongs to your Captain . If you 've detected the extensive weaponry deployed on the moon , know this . With one remote command , I can cause that weaponry to self-destruct , destroying the surface of the moon and everyone on it . Neither of us wants that , do we ? Think of the cost of replacing all those weapons . Awfully hard to come by in this region . And it would make you so vulnerable to your enemies . We 'll leave as soon as we 've retrieved our crewmen ... all of them , including Chakotay , if he 's alive . And if one of your people is with him , he 'll be returned to you . They 're moving into a lower orbit . Looks like they 're intending to enter the atmosphere . I need communication with the surface , B 'Elanna , and soon . I still haven 't been able to get the dampening field working . I can 't even give you an estimate . Should we take Voyager down ? I 've already run a soil analysis . The surface won 't support a landing . Then I guess the Captain 's going to be greeted by some unexpected visitors . At least we bought her some time . Good morning . How did you sleep ? Fine . Really ? You seemed a little restless to me . What do you mean ? All that skulking around , throwing things . You were awake ? You think I 'm going to get much sleep around an Ogla warrior who 's threatened to kill me ? Why didn 't you go through with it ? I am a coward . I don 't believe that . I don 't believe you do , either . I think maybe you 're beginning to realize I 'm not your enemy , and only a fool would kill a friend . If you are my friend ... then you 're my only one . What happens to me now ? Where do I go ? Would any other Kazon sect accept you ? I would be a goven , an outcast . Each Kazon sect I meet would cut one digit off , send me away . How many Kazon sects are there ? It changes every day . Yesterday , there were 18 . I guess you could come with us . To do what ? Dress in a uniform ? You wouldn 't have to wear a uniform . And the closer you get to your home , the farther I would be from mine . If only you had killed me . Captain , four life-forms approaching . 40 meters . They appear to be Kazon . Please , put your weapons away . We 've come to help you . Help us ? With what ? We made contact with your ship and learned of the plight of your missing crewman . We 've come to offer our assistance in finding him . That 's very kind of you . You 're walking on very dangerous ground . There are concealed weapons everywhere . Come . We will lead you through them . Very well . Tell me about the other uniforms ... the ones the Kazon fought . The Trabe . The Kazon shared their homeworld ... if you can call it sharing . They had everything ; we had nothing . Until we took it from them in the revolt 26 years ago . What is it ? People coming this way . Humans and Kazon . What are we going to do ? There 's only one way back to the Ogla for you and that 's if you earn your name . So I guess that 's what you 'll have to do . But how ? You 're going to have to kill me . The signal seems to be coming from some caves approximately 40 meters ahead . Your technology continues to amaze us . It would have taken us weeks to track them . After this is over , we have to discuss an alliance . I would welcome your friendship , Maje . Captain Janeway , I 'm reading elevated ... radiothermic levels here . The Ocampa female is correct . This is a particularly dangerous place . We lose many trainees here . Perhaps you would prefer if we proceeded alone . They can 't be far now . Thanks , but I think we 'll stick together . Voyager to away team . We 're here , Mr. Paris . We finally broke through the interference , Captain . Are you all right ? We had a run-in ... Everything is fine . We have the assistance of the Ogla . That 's what I was going to tell you to expect . Can you lock on to Commander Chakotay ? Stand by . Voyager to Chakotay . Do you read ? I 'm fine , Paris . Stand by for us to beam you out of there . Belay that , Voyager . Stand by . According to my readings , the away team 's only 50 meters away . Right , but don 't ... And alert Sick Bay to prepare for a Code White resuscitation . Did you say " Code White " ? Correct . I don 't have time to explain now . Chakotay out . It 'll be all right . Our technology can revive me even if I 'm brain-dead for two minutes . Why are you doing this ? Like you said , it 's my fault you don 't have your name . I can 't leave you behind like this . Chakotay to away team . Good to hear your voice , Commander . Captain , proceed with caution . I have been taken prisoner by a young Kazon . He 's threatening to kill me . This way . It 's safer . I would beg to differ . Based on these readings , that way would seem the logical choice . I must apologize for my comrade . I believe he 's trying to mislead you . So your technology is not always an ally . Sometimes it betrays you ... pity . I 'm afraid you would not score well in our training exercises . Away team to Voyager . Captain , that panel is a micro-generator . You 're right . If we can get a narrow beam through the field , we can disable it . We could try remodulating the phasers to a higher-frequency output . Make it fast . I 've been waiting for you , Razik . So , the Federation Commander is your prisoner . I only came with him so I could have another chance to kill him . So you could earn your name . That 's what I 've been hoping for , Razik . But you taught me well . I know what you 're going to say . You 've said it so many times before . In battle , there are no second chances . But you are not my enemy . He is . My name is Jal Karden , Kazon-Ogla . You are first maje now , Haliz . My life is yours . Kill me if you wish , or let me live and I will follow you into battle whenever you command . Jal Karden . Kazon-Ogla . Kazon-Ogla . The Federation does not belong here . If we meet again , I will not hesitate to kill you . I understand . Janeway to Voyager . Five to beam up . A-koo-chee-moya . I pray on this day of memories to speak to my father ... the one whom the wind called Kolopak . Father , if you can hear me among these unnamed stars , I ask you to continue to watch over me as you 've always done . I ask you also to watch over a boy called Karden , who has a difficult path to travel . A-koo-chee-moya .

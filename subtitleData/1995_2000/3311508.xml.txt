 Oh . Hey . Stevie.you OK ? I got- - I got the wind knocked out of me . It looks like a cave . Stevie.what 's goin ' on ? It 's a human skull ! Toss it up , Steve . No way. butt-wipe . this is mine . Anyway.there 's bones all over the place. man . Whew . What the ... Stevie ? Hey . Stevie . You OK ? Hey. man . Let 's get out of here . Give me a 14-footer ! This is Captain Miles Cooles . Got a rescue situation in progress ... I 'll be the old town road l.C. Rope 's in the hole . Let 's go . Two down . What you got.T.C. ? Talk to me . Do you see the boy ? Talk to me . Come back.T.C. You see the kid ? Danny. check T.C. ' s radio . T.C. ? Glenn . Sal. in the hole . - Get those people out of here ! - Move ' em back ! Come on . Move back . Move back. folks . I sent four men down for the boy . Report is his eyes have turned black . Now we 've lost communication with my men . What about my men ? What about my men ? What the hell is this ? It 's Bronschweig . Sir. the impossible scenario that we never planned for ... we better come up with a plan . We 've evacuated the building and searched it bottom to top . There 's no trace of an explosive device ... or anything resembling one . Have you sent the dogs through ? Yes. sir . Well. send ' em through again . All right. guys ! Let 's do it again ! Mulder. it 's me . Where are you . Scully ? I 'm on the roof . Did you find anything ? No . I haven 't . What 's wrong ? I just climbed up 12floors . I 'm hot . I 'm thirsty . and.to be honest ... I 'm wondering what I 'm doing up here . You 're looking for a bomb . Yes , I know that . but the threat was called ... into the federal building across the street . I think that 's covered . When a terrorist bomb threat is called in ... the rational purpose of providing that information ... is to allow us to find the bomb . The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror . if you 'd study the statistics ... you 'd find a model behavioral pattern for almost every case ... where a threat has turned up an explosive device ... and if we don 't act in accordance with that data ... if you ignore it . as we have done ... the chances are great that if there actually is a bomb ... we might not find it . Lives could be lost . Mulder ... Mulder ? Boom . Jesus . Mulder . Whatever happened to playing a hunch . Scully ? The element of surprise . random acts of unpredictability . if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen ... or expect the unexpected ... in a universe of infinite possibilities ... we may find ourselves at the mercy of anyone ... or anything that cannot be programmed. categorized ... or easily referenced . What are we doing up here ? It 's hotter than hell . I know you 're bored in this assignment . Mulder ... but unconventional thinking will only get you in trouble now . What makes you think I 'm bored ? Quit looking for what isn 't there . They 've closed the X-Files . There 's procedure to be followed now. protocol . Maybe we should call in a bomb threat to Houston . I think it 's free beer night at the Astrodome . Oh . Now what ? It 's locked ? So much for anticipating the unforeseen . I had you . No. you didn 't . Yeah . I had you big time . You had nothing . I saw you jiggle the handle . I saw your face . Mulder . There was a definite moment of panic . You 've never seen me panic . When I panic . I make this face . That was the face . You didn 't see that face . I saw that face . You 're buying . You want Coke . Pepsi. saline IV ? Something sweet . Come on . Scully . Scully . I found the bomb . You 're funny . Where are you . Mulder ? I 'm in the vending room . Is that you pounding ? Yeah . You gotta get somebody to open that door . Nice try . Mulder . It 's in the soda machine . You 've got about 14 minutes to evacuate this building . Come on . Mulder . Thirteen fifty-six . Thirteen fifty-four . Thirteen fifty-two . Thirteen fifty . You see a pattern emerging here . Scully ? Hold on . Mulder . I 'm gonna get you out of there . I need this building evacuated and cleared out in 10 minutes ! Call the fire department ... and have them block off the City Center ... and a one-mile radius around the building ! - Ten minutes ? - Don 't think ! Pick up that phone and make it happen ! This is security . This is Special Agent Dana Scully . I need to speak with S.A.C. Michaud . He 's got the wrong building . Where is it ? in the vending machine . He 's locked in with it . Scully , you know that face I just showed you ? I 'm making it again . Get away from the door . We 're coming through it . Clear ! Tell me that 's just soda pop in those canisters . It 's just what it looks like . Big l.E.D. Ten gallons of Astrolite . OK ... get everybody out of here . Clear the area . Come on . Let 's go . Somebody 's gotta stay here with you . I gave you an order . Get out . Evacuate the building . Can you diffuse it ? Yes . I can . We got less than four minutes to find out if you 're right . Did you hear what I said ? Get out . Come on . Mulder . Get moving here. people ! Come on. come on ! Come on ! FBI All clear ! The building 's clear ! Mulder , what are you doing ? Something 's wrong ! Mulder ! Something 's not right . Get in the car . There 's no time ! Let 's go ! Get in the car ! Come on ! Come on ! Get down ! Next time.you 're buying . light of Waco and Ruby Ridge ... there is a heightened need ... at the attorney general 's office to place responsibility ... as early as possible for the catastrophic destruction ... of public property and lives due to terrorist activities . Many details are still unclear ... but we 're under some pressure from the attorney general ... to accurately describe what happened ... so that she can issue a public statement . We know now that five people died in the explosion . Special- - Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud ... who was trying to diffuse the bomb ... three firemen from Dallas . and a young boy . Excuse me . The firemen and the young boy . they were found in the building ? Agent Mulder . since you weren 't able ... to be on time for this hearing ... I 'd like you to step outside ... so we can hear Agent Scully 's version of the facts ... so that she will not be paid the same disrespect . We were told the building was clear . You 'll get your turn . Please step outside . Sit down . They 're still talking to Scully . About what ? They 're asking her for a narrative ... to find out why she was in the wrong building . She was with me . You don 't see what 's going on here. do you ? There 's $ 45 million worth of damage to the city of Dallas . Lives have been lost . No suspects have been named . So the story that 's being shaped ... is that this could have been prevented . They want to blame us ? Agent Mulder . you and I both know ... that if it looks bad . it 's bad for the FBI . Blame has to be assigned somewhere . if they want somebody to blame . then blame me . Agent Scully doesn 't deserve this . She 's in there now saying the same thing about you . No . I breached protocol . I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone . Agent Scully says she ordered you out of the building . - You wanted to go back in . - No . They 're asking for you. sir . Thank you . Whatever you told them . you don 't have to protect me . I only told the truth . They 're trying to divide us . We can 't let them . Mulder , they have divided us . They 're splitting us up . What are you talking about ? I have a meeting with O.P.R. day after tomorrow ... for remediation and reassignment . They put us together . Because they wanted me to invalidate ... your investigations into the paranormal ... but I think this goes deeper than that now . This is not about you . They 're doing this to me . They 're not doing this . Mulder . I left behind a career in medicine ... because I thought I could make a difference at the FBI ... but it hasn 't turned out that way ... and now if they were to transfer me to Omaha ... or Cleveland or some field office ... it just doesn 't hold the interest for me ... that it once did . Not after what I 've seen and done . You 're quitting . Maybe you should ask whether your heart 's still in it.too. Agent Mulder.you 're up . I 'm sorry . Mulder . Good luck . I 'd say this exceeds your minimum daily requirement . Whoa . You 've got to train for that kind of heavy lifting . Poopy day ? So ... what do you do ? What do I do ? Mm-hmm . I 'm the key figure ... in an ongoing government charade : The plot to conceal the truth ... about the existence of extraterrestrials . It 's a global conspiracy . actually ... with key players in the highest levels of power ... that reaches down into the lives ... of every man.woman. and child on this planet . So. of course . no one believes me . I 'm an annoyance to my superiors ... a joke to my peers . They call me Spooky . Spooky Mulder ... whose sister was abducted by aliens ... when he was just a kid ... and he chases little green men with a badge and a gun ... shouting to the heavens or anyone who will listen ... that the fix is in and that the sky is falling ... and when it hits ... it 's gonna be the shit storm of all time . Well ... I would say that about does it . Spooky . Does what ? Well . Looks like 86 is your lucky number . You know . one is the loneliest number . Hello ? - Hello ! - Sorry . That official FBI business ? What ? Bet the bureau 's accusing you ... of the same thing in Dallas : Standing around holding your yank ... while bombs are exploding . Do I know you ? No. but I 've been watching your career for a good while ... back when you were just a promising young agent ... Before that . You come out here for a reason ? Yeah . I did . My name is Kurtzweil- - Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil . I know that name ? I 'm an old friend of your father 's . at the Department of State ... we were what you might call fellow travelers ... but his disenchantment outlasted mine . Right . How 'd you find me ? I heard you come in here now and again . Figured you 'd need a little drinky tonight . You a reporter ? I 'm a doctor . I mentioned that . Ob-gyn . You got somethin ' to say ... you got until I can hail a cab . There 's something you don 't know ... about the bombing in Dallas . What 's that ? S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried ... or intended to diffuse that bomb . He just let it explode in his face. huh ? What 's the question no one 's asking ? Why that building ? Why not the federal building ? The federal building was too well guarded . No . They put the bomb in that building ... because it did have federal offices there . The Federal Emergency Management Agency ... had a provisional medical quarantine office there ... which is where the bodies were found ... but that 's the thing . the thing you didn 't know ... the thing you 'd never think to check : Those people were already dead . Before the bomb went off ? That 's what I 'm saying . Darius Michaud was a 22-year veteran of the bureau . Michaud was a patriot . The people he was loyal to know their way around Dallas . They blew that building to hide something ... maybe even something they couldn 't predict . You 're telling me they blew up that entire building ... just to hide the bodies of those firemen ? And one little boy . I think you 're full of shit . Do you ? Arlington. please . Actually .you know . Let 's go to Georgetown . Let 's go to Georgetown . I woke you . Did I wake you ? No . Why not ? It 's 3 : 00 in the morning . Are you drunk . Mulder ? I was until about 20 minutes ago.yeah. Was that before or after you decided to come here ? What exactly are you implying ? Go home . Mulder . No . Get dressed . - It 's late . - Get dressed . What are you doing ? Just get dressed . and I 'll explain on the way . Nitrogen ? Two point seven seven . FIRST Methane ? Zero ... You 've got something to show me . We brought the atmosphere down to freezing ... in order to control the development ... which is like nothing we 've ever seen . Brought on by what ? Heat . I think . The coincident invasion of a host--the fireman- - and an environment ... that raised his body temperature above 98.6 . This man 's still alive . Technically and biologically . but he 'll never recover . How can this be ? The developing organism ... is using his life energy . digesting bone and tissue . We 've just slowed the process . Do you want us to destroy this one , too ... before it gestates ? No . No . We need to try our vaccine on it . And if it 's unsuccessful ? Burn it like the others . I.D. and floor you 're visiting . We 're going down to the morgue . That area is off-limits except to authorized medical personnel . On whose orders ? General McAddie . General McAddie requested our coming down here . We were awakened at3 a.m. and told to get here immediately . I don 't know anything about that . Call General McAddie . I don 't have the number . Call the switchboard . They 'll patch you through . Jesus , you don 't know the switchboard number ? I 'm calling my C.O. We don 't have time to dick around ... while you demonstrate your ignorance . The order came directly from General McAddie . Call him . We 'll conduct our business while you confirm authorization . Why don 't you head down . and I 'll confirm authorization ? Thank you . Why is the morgue suddenly off-limits ... on the orders of a general ? This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas ? According to the toe tag . And you 're looking for ... Cause of death . I can tell you that without even looking at him . " Concussive organ failure ... " due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris . " Mulder , this man 's already been autopsied . You can tell by the way he 's been wrapped and dressed . Does this fit the description you just read ? Oh. my God . This man 's tissue . Mulder . It 's like jelly . There 's been some kind of cellular breakdown . God. it 's completely edematous . And there 's been no autopsy performed here . No Y-incision. no internal exam . You mean the cause of death in that report is false ? That this man didn 't die from an explosion ... or from flying debris ? I can 't tell you what killed this man . I 'm not sure anybody else could claim to. either . Mulder . you knew before we got here ... this man didn 't die at the bomb site . I 'd been told as much . You 're saying this is a cover-up ? Of what ? I don 't know ... but I 've a hunch what you 'll find ... won 't be anything that 's easy to categorize or reference . This is going to take some time . Somebody 's going to figure out sooner or later ... that we 're not supposed to be here . We 're being blamed for this man 's death . I 'd like to know what he died of . Wouldn 't you ? I think that 's it up here . Boy . Lincoln . Charles three. seven. one . Anything else ? Tell them to look for anything . Excuse me . Can I help you ? Is this Dr. Kurtzweil 's residence ? Do you have business with him ? Yeah . I 'm looking for him . You 're looking for him for what ? The feds are looking for him , too . Real nice business he 's got. huh ? What 's that ? Selling naked pictures of little kids on his computer . You looking for him for some other reason ? Yeah . I had an appointment for a pelvic examination . You want a call if we turn up this Kurtzweil ? Don 't bother . See this crap ? Somebody knows I 'm talking to you . Not according to the men in blue . What now. kiddie porn again ? Sexual battery of a patient ? They want to discredit you for what ? Because I 'm a dangerous man . Because I know too much about the truth . That end-of-the-world . apocalyptic garbage you write ? You know my work ? - I was right about Dallas . - How were you right ? Are you familiar with the Hanta virus ? Yeah . It was a deadly virus spread by field mice ... in the southwestern United States several years ago . According to the newspaper ... FEMA was called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus . Are you familiar with what ... the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's real power is ? FEMA allows the White House ... to suspend constitutional government ... upon declaration of a national emergency . Think about that . What is an agency with such broad. sweeping power ... doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas ? It wasn 't such a small outbreak . No . I 'm saying it wasn 't the Hanta virus . What was it ? What was it ? When we were young men in the military ... your father and I were recruited for a project . They told us it was biological warfare. a virus . What killed those men ? What killed them I won 't even write about . We have no context for what killed those men ... or any appreciation ... of the scale which it will be unleashed in the future . A plague ? A plague to end all plagues . A silent weapon for a quiet war . The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism ... for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . They 've been working on this for 50 years . While the rest of the world were fighting gooks and commies ... these men have been secretly negotiating ... a planned Armageddon . Negotiating with whom ? I think you know . The timetable has been set . It 'll happen on a holiday ... when people are away from their homes . The president will declare a state of emergency ... at which time all government ... all federal agencies will come under the power ... of the Federal Emergency Management Agency- - FEMA ... the secret government . And they call me paranoid . Go back to Dallas . Agent Mulder. and dig . Orwe 'll find out along with the rest of the country ... when it 's too late . Scully. it 's me . Yeah ? Why are you whispering ? I can 't really talk right now . What did you find ? Evidence of a massive infection . What kind of infection ? I don 't know . All right . Listen to me . I 'm going home and booking myself on a flight to Dallas . - I 'll get you a ticket , too . - Mulder-- I need you there with me . I need your expertise . Mulder . I 've got a hearing tomorrow . You 'll be back in time ... and maybe with evidence that 'll blow it away . Mulder . I can 't . I 'm past the point of common sense here . It 's not common sense . Can you--Are you there ? Scully ? Scully ? I 'm afraid you 're looking for a needle in a haystack . This explosion was so devastating ... there hasn 't been much that we 've been able to put together . I 'm looking for anything unusual . Maybe something from the FEMA offices ... where those bodies were found ? We weren 't expecting to find those remains ... and we sent them off to Washington . Anything from those offices not sent to D.C. yet ? Bone fragments turned up in the sift this morning . We thought we had another fatality ... but we found out FEMA got them from an archeological site . Have you examined them ? No . Just fossils . I 'd like her to examine them . if you don 't mind . Let me see if I can find what you 're looking for . I thought you weren 't coming . I wasn 't planning on it ... after spending half an hour in cold storage this morning ... but I got a better look at blood and tissue samples ... I took from the fireman . What did you find ? Something I couldn 't show to anybody else ... without causing the kind of attention I 'd like to avoid . But what those men were infected with ... contains a protein code that I 've never seen before . What it did to them . it did extremely fast . How was it contracted ? That I don 't know . Unless it can respond to conventional treatment ... it could be a serious health threat . Like I said . these are just fossils . They weren 't near the blast center. so they won 't tell much . Right . Why don 't you check this out ? You said you knew where these were found ? Show you on the map . I want all of these settings checked and recalibrated . I want a steady minus two degrees Celsius ... throughout the transfer of the body ... after I 've administered the vaccine . Go ahead and move the body . - It 's gone ! - What ? It 's left the body ! I think it 's gestated . What 's the matter ? Wait . I can see it . Oh ... Jesus . Lord . You see it ? Yeah ! So much for little green men . I need you down here ! Yee-aah ! Aah ! Yee-aah ! Help ! I need help . What are you doing ? Oh ! My God . Aah ! Go ahead ! Run faster ! Faster . Muriel ! Good . Hey. no fair ! OK ! Run with me ! Matthew. quickly ! Quickly . Matthew ! Faster ! Sir , you have a call . Yes . We have a situation . The members are assembling . Is it an emergency ? Yes . A meeting has been set tonight in London ... to determine a course . Who called this meeting ? Stronghold . He just got on a plane in Tunis . Ow ! No. no. no . Yes. he 's OK . No. he 's not going to die . Come on. hurry ! It 's his knee ! We were going down from the hill. and he fell . Has Stronghold arrived ? Yes . They 're waiting in the library. sir . We were beginning to worry . Some of us have traveled so far . and you are the last to arrive . I 'm sorry . My grandson fell and broke his leg . While we 've been made to wait ... we watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns . More concerns than what ? We 've been forced to reassess our role in colonization ... by new facts of biology which have presented themselves . The virus has mutated . Into what ? A new extraterrestrial biological entity . My God ! The geometry of mass infection ... presents certain conceptual reevaluations for us ... about our place in their colonization . This isn 't colonization . This is spontaneous repopulation . All our work ... if it 's true . they 've been using us all along . We 've been laboring under a lie . Could be an isolated case . How can we know ? We 're going to tell them what we found ... what we 've learned ... by turning over a body infected with the gestating organism . In hope of what ? Learning that it 's true ? That we are nothing but digestives ... for the creation of a new race of alien life forms ? By cooperating now ... we are but beggars to our own demise . Cooperation 's the only chance of saving ourselves . They still need us to carry out their preparations . We 'll continue to use them as they do us ... if only to play for more time to continue work ... on our vaccine . My lateness might just as well have been absence . A course has already been taken . There are complications . Mulder saw one of the infected bodies ... that we destroyed in Dallas . He 's gone back there again . Someone has tipped him . Who ? Kurtzweil we think . No one believes Kurtzweil or his books . He 's a toiler. a crank . Mulder believes him . Then Kurtzweil must be removed . As must Mulder . Kill Mulder , we take the risk ... of turning one man 's quest into a crusade . Then you must take away what he holds most valuable ... that with which he can 't live without . I don 't know . Mulder . I don 't see any evidence of an archeological ... or any other kind of a dig site . This is where he marked on the map ... where he said those fossils were unearthed . You 're sure those fossils were infected ... with the same virus you saw at the morgue ? Both sets of bones were porous ... as if the virus or causative microbe were decomposing it . And you 've never seen that virus before ? No . Look at that . That look like new grass to you ? Looks pretty green for this climate . Uh-huh . The ground 's dry about an inch down . This was laid recently . The equipment looks brand-new too . No irrigation system . Somebody 's covering their tracks . Hey ! Hey . You boys live around here ? Yeah . You seen anybody digging over there ? We 're not supposed to talk about it . Not supposed to talk about it ? Who told you that ? Nobody . Nobody ? Same nobody that built that playground ? Nobody buy you those new bikes too ? I think you better tell us . We don 't even know you . We 're FBI agents . You 're not FBI agents . How do you know ? 'Cause y 'all look like door-to-door salesmen . Hey , you want to buy a badge ? They all left an hour ago . Going that way . Unmarked tanker trucks . What are archeologists hauling out in tanker trucks ? I don 't know . Mulder . Where are they going with it ? We need to answer that if we 're going to find them . What are my choices ? About 100 miles of nothing in both directions . Which way you think they went ? You got two choices . One of them 's wrong . I think they went left . I don 't know why . I think they went right . Five years together . How many times I been wrong ? Never . Not driving. anyway . I was right about the bomb . This is great . This is fitting . What ? I have to be in Washington . D.C. in 11 hours for a hearing ... and the outcome might possibly affect ... one of the biggest decisions of my life ... and here I am in Nowhere.Texas. chasing phantom tanker trucks . Not tanker trucks . We 're chasing evidence . Of what exactly ? That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off to hide something ... bodies infected with a virus yourself detected . Mulder.they haul oil in tanker trucks . They haul gas in tanker trucks . They do not haul viruses in tanker trucks . Well.they may be hauling a virus in these tanker trucks . What do you mean ? Mulder ? What are you not telling me ? Ahem . Mulder ? The virus may be extraterrestrial . I don 't- - Mulder . I don 't- - What do you think they are ? I have no idea . This is weird . Mulder . Very weird . Any thoughts as to why anybody would be growing corn ... in the middle of the desert ? Those could be giant Jiffy-Pop poppers . It 's cool in here . The temperature 's being regulated . For the purpose of what ? I think we 're on top of a larger structure here . This is some kind of a venting system . You hear something ? You hear that ? I hear a humming . Mm-hmm . Like electricity . High voltage maybe . Maybe . Maybe not . Scully ? Yeah ? Run ! Scully ? I can 't see ! Give me your hand ! Did you get stung ? I don 't think so . Talk to me . Scully ! Scully ! Damn it ! Scully ! Hey ! Scully ! Scully ! Talk to me . Scully ! Mulder ! Scully ! Mulder ! Can you hear me ? Mulder ! Scully ! Scully ! Scully ! Mulder ! Scully ! Scully , talk to me ! Mulder ! Where did they go ? Come on . She 's coming in . Special Agent Scully . I apologize for making you wait . I have new evidence . Evidence of what ? These are fossilized bone fragments ... that I 've been able to study ... that were gathered at the bomb site in Dallas . You 've been back to Dallas ? Yes . You found something . Yeah. on the Texas border . Some kind of experiment . Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks . What ? I 'm not sure . A virus . I think . And I also have reason to believe that ... there may have been some involvement ... by Special Agent in Charge Michaud . Those are very serious allegations . Yes . I know . - You saw this experiment ? - Yeah. butte were chased off . What did it look like ? There were bees. corn crops . You have conclusive evidence of this ... something to tie your claim to the crime ? Not completely conclusive . I hope to . butte are in the process of- - We 're working towards gathering that evidence . Working with ? With Agent Mulder . What are they ? What do you think ? A transportation system . Transgenic crops . The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus . That would be my guess . Your guess ? What do you mean .your guess ? Hey ! You told me you had answers . Yeah . Well . I don 't have them all . You didn 't know my father . Like I told you . he and I were old friends . You 've been using me ... to gather information for your goddamn books ! Kurtzweil . Kurtzweil ! You 'd be shit out of luck without me . You saw what you saw because of me . I 'm putting my ass on the line . Your ass ? I just got chased through Texas by two black helicopters . Why do you think it is you 're standing here talking to me ? These people don 't make mistakes . What 's wrong ? Salt Lake City . Utah . Transfer effective immediately . I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation . You can 't quit now . I can . I debated whether or not even to tell you in person- - We are close to something here ! We 're on the verge . You 're on the verge . Please don 't do this to me . After what you saw last night and all you 've seen ... you can just walk away ? I have . I did . It 's done . I need you on this . You don 't need me . You never have . I 've just held you back . I gotta go . You want to tell yourself that so you can quit ... with a clear conscience . you can . But you 're wrong . Why did they assign me to you in the first place ? To debunk your work . To rein you in . to shut you down . But you saved me . As difficult and as frustrating as it 's been sometimes ... your goddamn strict rationalism and science ... have saved me a thousand times over . You kept me honest . You made me a whole person . I owe you everything ... Scully. and you owe me nothing . I don 't know if I want to do this alone . I don 't even know if I can . And if I quit now , they win . Ow ! Jesus . I 'm sorry . No . Something stung me . It must have gotten in your shirt . Mulder ... Huh ? Something 's wrong . What ? I 'm having lancinating pain in ... What ? ... my chest . Ohh ! Scully . My motor functions are being affected . My pulse is thready . And I have a ... a funny taste in the back of my throat . I think you 're going into anaphylactic shock . No . I have no allergies . WOEmergency dispatch . This is Special Agent Fox Mulder . I have an emergency . An agent 's down . Can you hear me ? Can you say your name ? She 's got constriction in the throat and larynx . Passages are open . OK . Let 's get her in the van right away . Look out . Comin ' through . Watch your back . She had a funny taste in her throat ... but she 's not allergic to bee stings . The bee that stung her might have been carrying a virus . A virus ? Yeah . Tell the doctor . Radio in an allergic reaction . No. a virus . And I want to go with you ! What hospital ? l- - What hospital are you taking her to ? - What are you doing ? - Reading his chart . - Put it down . - When I 'm ready . - You two shut up . - I think he 's waking . He 's coming to . Hey . Mulder . Mulder . Oh . God . Cowardly Lion . Scarecrow. and ... Toto . What am I doing here ? A bullet glanced off your temporal plate . Three centimeters left . and we 'd all be playing harps . You 've been unconscious since you got here . Where 's Scully ? We know you called 911 ... but that call must have been intercepted . Scully had a reaction to an Africanized honey bee ... we found in your hall . I gotta go look for her . Mulder. easy. easy . You 're staying right here . You don 't understand . It 's connected to Dallas . Where is she ? I 'll look . I don 't know . but I know someone who might . You leave here unprotected . how far will you get ? How far will they let you get ? They 'll know if you walk out of here . What can we do ? You can strip Byers naked . What ? I need your clothes . It 's Mulder . Dr. Kurtzweil. isn 't it ? Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil ? Mr. Mulder . What happened to Kurtzweil ? He 's come and gone . I want to know where Scully is . The location of Agent Scully and the means to save her life . Please . What is it ? A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully 's infected with . It must be administered within 96 hours . That leaves you little time to reach those coordinates . You 're lying . No ... though I have no means to prove otherwise . The virus is extraterrestrial . We know very little about it ... except that it was the original inhabitant of this planet . A virus ? What is a virus ... but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated ? Living in a cave. underground ... until it mutates and attacks . This is what you 've been conspiring to conceal ? A disease ? No ! For God 's sake . you 've got it all backwards . AIDS. the Ebola virus- - on an evolutionary scale . they are newborns . This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs . What do you mean.walked ? Your aliens . Agent Mulder . Your little green men ... arrived here millions of years ago . Those that didn 't leave ... have been lying dormant underground ... since the last Ice Age ... in the form of an evolved pathogen ... waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race ... when it comes to colonize the planet ... using us as hosts . Against this . we have no defense . Nothing but a weak vaccine . Do you see why it was kept secret ? Why. even the best men . men like your father ... could not let the truth be known . Until Dallas ... we believed the virus would simply control us ... that mass infection would make us a slave race . You can imagine our surprise when they began to gestate . My group has been working cooperatively ... with the alien colonists ... facilitating programs like the one you saw ... to give us access to the virus ... in hope that we might be able secretly to develop a cure . To save your own asses . Survival is the ultimate ideology . Your father wisely refused to believe this . But he sacrificed my sister . He let them take Samantha . Without a vaccination ... the only true survivors of the viral holocaust ... will be those immune to it- - human-alien clones . He allowed your sister to be abducted ... to be taken to a cloning program for one reason . So she would survive ... as a genetic hybrid . Your father chose hope over selfishness . Hope .the only future he had . his children . His hope for you ... was that you would uncover the truth about the project ... that you would stop it ... that you would fight the future . Why are you telling me this ? For the sake of my own children . Once it 's learned what I 've told you ... my life will be over . Where is Dr. Kurtzweil ? I 'd like to get out of the car now . Stop the car ! Driver . The men I work with will stop at nothing ... to clear the way for what they believe is their stake ... in the inevitable future . I was ordered to kill Dr. Kurtzweil ... as I was ordered to kill you . Ugh . Trust no one . Mr. Mulder . Get out of the car . Why ? The upholstery 's already ruined . Get out of the car ! You have precious little time . What I 've given you ... the alien colonists don 't yet know exists . The vaccine you hold ... is the only defense against the virus . It 's introduction into an alien environment ... may have the power to destroy the delicate plans ... we have so assiduously protected ... for the last 50 years . What do you mean . may have ? Find Agent Scully . Only then will you realize ... the scope and grandeur of the project . Go ! Go now ! Ohh . Oh. shit . Aah ! Secure the station . I want everybody else down below . if you 're not armed . arm yourselves . We may have a breach . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Come on. move. move ! Let 's go ! Scully ? There 's a contaminant in the system . Mulder has the vaccine . Breathe . Scully. can you breathe ? Cold . I 'm cold . I 'll get you out of there . Abandon your posts ! Evacuate ! What 's happened ? It 's all going to hell ! - What about Mulder ? - He 'll never make it . Go ! Move ' em out ! We got to keep moving . Come on . I can 't . I can 't . Yeah. you can . Scully. reach up and grab that vent . Grab the vent ! Scully ? Jeez. breathe ! Breathe. breathe. breathe . - Huh ? Breathe in . Breathe in . Breathe ! Mulder . I had you big time . Move it . Oh ! Pull ! Come on ! Pull ! Mulder . Keep moving . Ohh . Go . Go. come on ! Almost there . Keep going ! Scully , you got to see this . Scully . in light of the report I 've got before me ... and the narrative I 'm now hearing ... my official report is incomplete ... pending these new facts I 'm being asked to reconcile . Agent Scully. though there 's now direct evidence ... that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing ... the other events you 've laid down here are ... too incredible on their own ... and quite frankly . implausible in their connection . What is it you find incredible ? Well. where would you like me to start ? So many of the events described in your report defy belief . Antarctica is a long way from Dallas . Agent Scully . I can 't submit a report to the attorney general ... that alleges the links you 've made here . Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under ... the rubric of domestic terrorism . No , they don 't . Most of what I find in here ... is lacking a coherent picture of any organization ... with an attributable motive . I realize the ordeal you 've endured ... has clearly affected you ... though the holes in your account leave us with little choice ... but to delete these references ... to our final report to the Justice Department ... until which time hard evidence becomes available ... that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation . I don 't believe the FBI currently has ... an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand . There 's an interesting work of fiction on page 24 . Mysteriously . our names have been omitted . They 're burying this thing . They 're just gonna dig a new hole and cover it up . I told O.P.R. everything I know . What I experienced , the virus- - how it 's spread by the bees from pollen in transgenic crops . Wasting your time . They 'll never believe you . Not unless your story can be programmed ... categorized . or easily referenced . We 'll go over their heads . No. no . How many times have we been here before ? Right here . so close to the truth . And now , with what we 've seen and what we know ... to be back at the beginning with nothing ? This is different . No. it isn 't . You were right to want to quit and to leave me . You should get as far away from me as you can . I 'm not gonna watch you die for my hollow personal cause . Go be a doctor . Go be a doctor while you still can . I can 't . I won 't . I 'll be a doctor. but my work is here with you now . That virus that I was exposed to- - whatever it is. it has a cure . You held it in your hand . How many other lives can we save ? Look ... if I quit now ... they win . Oh , you look hot and miserable . Why have you traveled all this way ? - We have business to discuss . - You have regular channels . This involves Mulder . Ahh. that name . Again and again . He 's seen more than he should . What has he seen ? Of the whole . he has seen but pieces . He 's determined now ... reinvested . He 's but one man . One man alone cannot fight the future . Yesterday ... I received this . Tonight . I 'm tangled ... in my blanket of clouds ... dreamin ' aloud . Things just won 't do without you ... matter of fact . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . I 'm on your back . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . if you 'd accept surrender ... I 'll give up some more . Weren 't you adored ? I cannot be without you ... matter of fact . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking after you . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking after ... you . Another heart is cracked ... in two . I 'm on your back . Uh-huh . I cannot be without you ... matter of fact . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . I 'm on your back . Ohh-ohh-ohh ... I 'm on your back . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking after you . if you walk out on me ... I 'm walking after ... you .

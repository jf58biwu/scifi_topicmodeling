I 've never seen anything like it . What 's with the mustache ? I 'm Clark Gable . I was at the costume party and I didn 't have time to change . It 's a shame , because there was this tall blonde dressed as a lion tamer ... Thank God I got her phone number . " They " did it , officer . Who are " they " ? - The Smurfs . - Don 't follow me , ma 'am . Get them out of here . I was telling them it 's against regulations ... How do they find out ? Who tells them ?

Get me the tape from that camera . What camera ? Come out , boys . The lieutenant wants to take a look . León , you must have one hell of a stomach . It 's just a snack . Pure carnage , Arribas . The bodywas destroyed . Burned , right ? What are these stains , Doctor ? Semen ? Could be . But it doesn 't look like she was raped . She still has her pantyhose on . Give me some tweezers . Find out when her birthdaywas . I want to question everyone here tomorrow morning . Boss , who could do such a thing ? They must have been soaked in blood . Never lose it , Lola .

Now go out and play . And show them how brave you are ! Yes , mother . FEDERAL POLICE What the hell would I know ? Who 'd brutally torture a poor old woman , stab her to death , disfigure her , dismember her , and then just walk away like nothing had happened ? Who could be so cruel and merciless ? A banker , perhaps ? The Social Security Administration has hired killers who liquidate helpless old people in order to save their pensions . They killed Lidia . Once she told me inner beauty was the most important thing in life . When she was young , she was very pretty . Was she wearing this brooch ? If not , take this photo to all the pawn shops . That 's the last one . You 're still Clark Gable ? Me ? No . Remember the lady lion tamer ? She said the mustache was sexy . Any suspects in this case ? None of the old people ? It was an outside job . Where 's the security camera tape ? We can 't find it . You can 't find it ? - It disappeared . - The autopsy , boss . Someone hated that old lady . The medical examiner said the stains weren 't semen . Theywere wax . Dried wax . - Dried wax ? - Dried wax . Pelayo , get me that damn tape . And some coffee . - With cream ? - Black . Lieutenant , Channel 10 says they have an exclusive . Happy New Year . We hope you started it on the right foot . Doña Lidia Rovina didn 't . She was brutally murdered last night . As we have announced , Channel 10 has exclusive footage from the security camera in the retirement home , the scene of the crime . Though police Lt. Arribas has not commented on it , this woman dressed as a nun is the principal suspect ... - One hell of a nun . - Champagne , please . They know who she is ? You can barely see her face . It could be anyone , even you . The President of the Republic sat down last night before our cameras to read his New Year 's address . Citizens of Spain , my fellow republicans , I 'd like ... Fucking politicians . The check . It 's already paid for , miss . Got a cigarette ? You know what I was thinking ? You must have been a beautiful litle girl . Ugly ! Ugly ! Ugly ! - Ugly ! Ugly ! Ugly ! - Miguel 's it ! Kiss the fetus ! Kiss her ! Kiss her ! Okay . Forget it . Give me a forfeit . I won 't kiss her . - No way . - Ifyou won 't kiss her ... - He has to show us his pecker ! - Show us ! But not to the fetus . To the fetus , too . To everyone but the fetus . Come on ! You look familiar . You just fucked me , remember ? That 's a good one ! Are you famous ? I 've seen you on TV . All right . Okay , fine . What are you waiting for ? Go . Start ...

It 's her . No doubt about it . Where is she ? Come closer . In the Almudena Cemetery . The cemetery ? She died 5years ago . The bitch has come back from the dead to get me . Is it the nun thing ? Yes , Ma 'am . You recognized her ? I think so . It 's a TV game show . I have to guess who it is . What 's the prize ? Sorry to keep you waiting . How can I help you ? A colleague ofyours already called about the Christmas raffle . Dr. Werner , do you know this woman ? I don 't think so . No , I don 't . You called yesterday and said you did . At exactly ... seven thirty-two . Must be a mistake . It was from this office . Who else could have done it ? I don 't know . Anyone . I spend a lot of time outside . The switchboard records all calls . Should I get the tape ? Wait ... All right . I called you . So you do know her . It was a mistake . I thought it was a nun that came here asking for alms two months ago . Nuns are like the Chinese . They all look alike . Are you sure ? Completely . At first I said no because I felt embarrassed . You must get a ton of ridiculous calls in these cases , right ? I 'm sorry to have wasted your time . We won 't botheryou any more . We can find ourway out . Where 's your mustache ? Remember the lady lion tamer ? It was a disguise . It 's not that I thought I 'd met a lady lion tamer ... but , well ... Not a lady lion tamer , nor a lady secretary , or cook , or anything . unemployed ? No , he 's a civil servant in the tax ministry . What 's wrong with that ? With civil servants ? Nothing . But " he 's " a civil servant . " He " , as in " a guy " . You understand now ? Lola , Lolila , my Lolila ... My beautiful girl . - You 'll wear me away . - And you always thought you were ugly ! You were always a beautiful girl . Seen with the eyes ofyour heart . The others have never been any good . So , tell me . How are you ? You must be married by now . I can 't find the right man . Are you asking for too much ? I onlywant to be loved . To be truly loved . always keep it with you . God bless you , Lolila . Take care , mother . Surprise them . Show the world what you 're capable of . I 'll try to . Mirror , mirror , who 's the fairest girl ? " You , Lola . You 're the most beautiful woman on earth . " Hi , Cinderelia . I 'm the big , bad wolf . Wrong fairytale , man . Hers is wrong . It should be " The Ugly Duckling " . " The Shrimp Woman " . You eat everything but the head . I brought you avery special present , my beautiful Lolila . Fuck , the bitch really is ugly . Don 't be scared , princess . You like it . Who goes first ? " Prince Charming " . Right , beautiful ? Go for it . Your first time . Abella and Pizarro , check calls . León y Lafuente ... León ... León ! Check the files for any similar cases . Do you think it could be a serial killer ? It 's possible . Everyone else question the old people again . Show the photo of the nun to the neighbors . - The usual . - Lieutenant ... Narcotics is doing a raid near my house . If I went with them , I could pick up my kids ... I believe , Abella , that yourjob is Homicides , right ? Let 's get to work . What about me , boss ? I don 't trust Werner . You know the university ? Pelayo at the university ? That 's funny . Yes , it is ... - Pardon ... - Look who 's here . Wasn 't he transferred ? To the tax ministry . But he still comes to all the parties . I heard he went as a lady lion tamer on New Years . - What ? - Imagine if some asshole didn 't know he was a guy ! Yeah ! Pelayo ? Pelayo ! What a surprise ! What are you doing here ? I had to talk to you . Where 's your mustache ? You left so quickly . Yeah ... Sorry about that ... But right now I can 't ... I 'm working . See you at the car . Boss ... Pelayo , just give me a chance . Get to know me . I really have to go . I 'll call you . Can I see you tonight ? I can 't , I 'm on night shift . Myjob 's like that ... - Tomorrow , then . - Fine , call me . Duty calls . I 'm sorry . Take care . I 'd hate it ifyou got hurt . Really ? Yes , of course . Of course I rememberWerner . Whywas he fired ? Wernerwent too far . He experimented his absurd theories on human beings . I remember the day he came and I told him he 'd been fired . He was sitting where you are now . " Do you think you 're God , Werner ? " I asked him . You know what he said ? " If God existed , he would be like me . " What were his theories ? " Morphogenetics " , my friend . Werner thought he could alter people 's genetic patterns through chemical agents . Imagine , one quick shot and whatever genetic illness , malformation , or disorder disappears like magic . Did he achieve anything ? If such a chemical agent existed , it would be the greatest advance in the history of medicine since Hippocrates . I told you Werner had a screw loose . His clinic is very successful , isn 't it ? The man who was going to get a nobel is stretching wrinkles for a bunch ofwealthy battIe-axes . We 'd like to have a copy ofWerner 's file . Of course . Just ask my secretary . Werner , daniel Werner . Here you go . Is this all there is ? Yes . That 's an unauthorized patient 's card . The name wasn 't made public . There 's just general data , blood type , birth date ... January 1st , 1982 ... What 's this number here ? It usually refers to the hospital where theywere born . - And ? - And what ? Which is it ? It 's the Milagrosa Hospital . Thank you very much . - When was your man 's birthday ? - Woman 's . We 're looking for awoman . January 1st , 1982 . You 're lucky . Not many babies are born on Jan. 1st . - Why ? - Doctors like holidays , too . They provoke labor to avoid them . I bet your baby was premature . - Hold this , sergeant . - Me ? Sing if she cries . You heard the nurse . Sing . What do I sing ? Jan. 1st 1982 . There 's a few . What was her blood type ? AB negative . That 's not a usual type . - That makes nine . - girls ? Six . Can I have a copy ? So it 's true . What ? Nothing . The older nurses say Lola Otero was born here . Lola Otero ? - " The beautiful Otero " ? - If it 's the same one . They say our Lola Otero was the ugliest baby ever born here . Who 's Lola Otero ? Don 't you ever read magazines , boss ? They called her " The most beautiful woman in the world " . Here 's the list . Thank you very much , nurse . Sergeant ... Yes ? Here . You 've become friends . When he 's older , I 'll buy him a drink . Take her dancing . It 's a girl . See ? I have a special magnetism for females . By the way , here 's my phone number . Give it to her when she turns 16 . You yourself can call me tonight . It so happens that I 'm free . Will you call me or not ? - No . - No ? Sorry that I keep asking you , boss , but I don 't understand what we 're doing . What is there to understand ? Well , what does Dr. " Warner " have to do with the nun ? Werner . Werner calls us saying he knows the nun . He retracts it the next day . Then it turns out he was fired for experimenting on someone born Jan. 1st , the same day Doña Lidia was killed . You see the connection ? This is what you wanted . An orange dress shoe , very comfortable and elegant . It 's an exclusive design . Take a few steps and you 'll see . This holiday season , give your child the authentic " Cinderella shoes " . And with thicker heels ? Not in an evening shoe , miss . Fine , I 'll take them . Ifyou want a flat shoe ... They 're prefect . Is a credit card okay ? Yes , fine . The authentic " Cinderella Shoes " , shoes foryour princess . A dream come true . You know why I 'm Quasimodo ? I want you to meet someone . THE LAST NIGHT OF THE 20TH CENTURY - I didn 't mean to scare you . - It 's okay . Everyone is scared when they see me . Since I 'm so ugly ... Would you like to dance ? Who , me ? I 'm not so awfully ugly under the mask . Nice party , isn 't it ? You know why I 'm Quasimodo ? - Why ? - Well ... Sorry . Because I think we 're all obsessed with physical beauty , always judging people by their exterior . It 's a dictatorship of aesthetics . Who knows ? It may sound silly , I think what 's important is what 's inside , what you think , what you feel . Don 't you agree ? You mean that ? Of course I do . Could you love someone who 's ugly ? - You could ? - Of course . Even the ugliest woman in the world ? If her heart is beautiful , why not ? You haven 't told me your name . - Lola . - I 'm Luis . I turn 18 tonight . That 's great ! I should have brought you a gift . But you didn 't know me . I knew something special would occur . And that 's you , Lola . I 've never danced so much . Actually , I 've never danced . You 're awonderful dancer , Lola . I just let you lead . With your hands on mywaist , I feel like I could fly if I wanted to . Silly , isn 't it ? It 's not silly at all , Lola . I could make you fly , ifyou wanted me to . It 's the loveliest night of my life . Everything you say is so meaningful . This is just the beginning . The bells are about to ring out . We have until 12 to think of awish , you 'll take offyour mask , we 'll kiss , and ourwishes will come true . Are you ready ? I 'll do everything you say . Everything . What 's wrong , Luis ? Don 't run away from me , I beg you . You said you could love the ugliest woman in the world . I can make you happy ! No one can love you like I can ! Hey ... I don 't know if I can do it with this on . FEDERAL CYBERLIBRARY " The Beautiful Otero : A Fairytale . " - You know Luis Casanova ? - No comment . - Since when ? - I said no comment .

This is Vicky , Miss Cantabria . Can I use yours ? You can use mine . Give it back later . It won 't shock me ? Enough chatting , girls . Let 's let Vicky unpack . Yes ? Carmelo . I 'm on myway . Hello , Lieutenant . Hi , Pelayo . Sew him up . Let 's talk about your case . What have you found out ? Your men have found five cases besides Doña Lidia 's . Five women of different ages killed on Jan. 1st with different " modus operandi " . The same killer ? Could be . Here are photos of them and of Doña Lidia . Theyweren 't killed on consecutive years . Despite your birthday theory . But it is true that all six bodies had traces ofwax , as if candles were put out on them . A revenge case , I 'd say . No one 's linked the cases until now ? The computers noticed it a few years ago , and they investigated it , but they couldn 't find anything to hold on to . The victims are unrelated . - What , then ? - There 's one possibility . Maybe deaths on the years without cases were listed as accidents . I asked your men to check it . They 're still on it , boss . If my suspicions are true , careful with that woman . The six victims from the first case in 2001 up to 2011 . We need five deaths to verifyyour theory . Do you have the files on your computer ? I want to see number3 . Have you found anything , boss ? Here we are . Found in her bedroom Jan. 3rd , 2006 . The autopsy revealed she 'd been dead 48 hours . Amplify it . Let 's see that portrait . Exactly . All the way . See something , boss ? Go to number 5 . The dressing room . The dancer . They killed herwhen she was changing costume during the New Year 's Eve show . The photos stuck in the mirror . This one 's similar to number3 . - Have you got Lidia 's file ? - Yes , boss . We 've got it . Tell him . You tell him . - No , you . - You , Goddamnit ! Someone tell us whatever it is ! We know what the victims have in common and we found the missing cases that were listed as accidental deaths . Know what the victims had in common ? Let me guess . They all had been Miss Spain . This is the future . It 's fame , money and dreams come true . It 's whyyou 're here . But girls , you have to obey the rules . And number one is : no men . Not even those cuties ? What is this ? You continue , Rocío . Tonight the press comes for the presentation . You have to be ready to leave the hotel at 7 : 00 sharp . Don 't let me down . gentlemen , this is private ... - Lt . Arribas . - Right , Lieutenant . You didn 't have to come . This is my 7th year . There are always bomb threats , feminists that want to castrate us , etc . Nothing ever happens . You do yourjob , let me do mine . We 'll be discreet . Anther thing . There are lots of girls here . - control your men . - Don 't worry . We 're cops . Jesus ! What would you give this one ? What would I give her ? An apartment and whatever else wants , with that pair of ... I 'd ... I 'd give her a 7 and 1 / 2 . A 7 and 1 / 2 , Pizarro ? Are you blind ? What about you , León ? I prefer - the blow-up ones . - Yeah . Too bad we can 't deflate them and take them home . Write down ten for me . He gives them all ten ! - Shit ! - They 're all hot ! What about this one ? A six . A six ? So what does yourwife get ? A negative 12 ? Hey , you don 't even mention mywife . Or I 'll tell internal affairs . You talking to me ? To me ? - My pizza ! - The lieutenant ! What 's going on here ? We were just checking the girls ' files . Lugo , 7 . Valencia , 8 and 1 / 2 . What is this ? We give them each an average of our scores . We 're thinking of having a betting pool to see who wins . Want in ? How much is the ante ? What score would you give this one , Lieutenant ? I say she 's a six . Are you all total dipshits ? This isn 't a game . Rememberyou 're on duty and this is a murder case . No more nonsense . I can 't leave you guys alone . So ? Have you found Lola ? You knew about it all , didn 't you , Doctor ? About Lola 's taking revenge on Cuca Maragato by killing other Miss Spains . You knew it , didn 't you ? How could she fall in love with that clown ? help us arrest her . You know her better than anyone . I have no idea where she is . I do . And why should I help the police ? Tell me , why ? The judge will remember . But above all , because you 're afraid of never seeing her alive again . She 's not a bad person , Lieutenant . She just had bad luck . No one 's ever really loved her . No one . You know what that 's like ? Does that mean " yes " ? - Who is it ? - It 's me . Montse . Just a second . I 'm in the bath . Vicky , what 's taking you so long ? - What is it ? - You 'll think I 'm dumb . I forgot my hairdryer , too . And we have the presentation ! Wait . I 'll get mine . I really appreciate it , honey . I wish you were my roommate . Mine doesn 't use a hairdryer . She 's athletic . Goes jogging , that kind of thing . My boyfriend 's in the army . We 'd better hurry or Carmelo ... Relax , we have time . You believe Miss Palmas fucks the jury president ? Don 't you ? I don 't know . I mean , don 't you sleep with him ? What ? What 's your name ? Vicky . What 's your real name ? You lend your things to a competitor and you don 't hump the president . Where did you come from ? What are you insinuating ? Your name 's not Vicky . You 're not Miss Cantabria . Don 't turn me in . Between us , you have no chance ofwinning . Everyone here does what she must . I was just curious . Go on , answer my question . Shall we go ? What 's your real name ? Vicky . Very elegant . I should be on awedding cake . - You could have shaved . - No ... I 'm growing a mustache . - The lion tamer again ? - Her name 's Vanessa , boss . We 're getting to know each other . Doctor ! Doctor , let us know ifyou notice anything . But what if Lola doesn 't plan on attacking one of these girls ? She will , but not tonight . Why is that ? She wants the one who becomes Miss Spain . But what ifyou 're mistaken ? " Ladies and gentlemen ... " No , that 's too boring . It should be smoother , more ... friendly . " Dear friends ... " Come on . You 're all lovely . Simply beautiful ! Well ... Finally , ladies and gentlemen . Here they are ! Thank you . Thanks very much . Dear friends .

Yes , Pelayo ? We haven 't found the doctoryet . - The clinic ? - We 've checked it . What do we do ? I guess I was naive to trust Dr. Werner . Don 't say that , boss . Send his picture to all the stations . - Right away . - Fine . See you tomorrow . Beauty , no ! Brains , yes ! Hello . Everything 's ready for the Miss Spain Pageant . Tonight 's the festival of beauty in which we 'll learn the name of the luckywoman who will wear the crown . But not everyone is in favor of beauty pageants . What do you think ?

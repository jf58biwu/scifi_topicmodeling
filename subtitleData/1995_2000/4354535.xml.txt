 [ Lead Breaks ] - [ Phone Rings ] - What ? - [ Jarod ] How well do you know your father ? - Better than you know yours . - Yes . Well , I 'm working on that one . - Why the call , Jarod ? [ Jarod ] You and your father are close . But how close ? Does he share important things with you ? Would he tell you about the big developments in his life ? I 'd be insanely optimistic to think this little quiz show had a bonus round , wouldn 't I ? - Check your mail , Miss Parker . - Why ? Because we all have a lot to learn . Including me . Gotta go . Don 't wanna be late for my first day of school . - Jarod - - [ Dial Tone ] What did he have to say ? A lot less than he knows , that 's for sure . [ Paper Rustling ] Miss Parker ? It 's a copy of a letter to my father from his attorney . He 's changing his will . - Hmm . - Miss Parker . Statistician from the Brooksberry field office . Swears she saw Jarod on her lunch break . Call Brooksberry . Get a local Sweeper team moving ... now . Okay . [ Scraping ] [ Jarod ] Well , well , well , the Vanguard Program . The finest minds at the university . I 'll have to do my best to keep up . Welcome ... to graduate class 523 - Psychology of the Criminal Mind . I 'm your new professor , Dr. Gardner . But please , call meJarod . Oh , my God ! [ Woman Screams ] Oh , my God ! [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Murmuring ] - Somebody get some help ! - Call 911 ! - You can cancel that call . - [ Woman ] What ? I may be a little sticky , but otherwise I 'm just fine . Oh , the gunmen . They were some drama students that I recruited . And the shots ? Blanks . I assume there 's a point to scaring the hell out of us like that . Oh , yes , sir . There 's absolutely a point . I 'm the cop . You 're the witness . Describe the gunman to me . - Tall , dark suit . - How tall ? How dark ? - Uh - - " Uh " doesn 't cut it . I need details . - What color hair did he have ? - Brown . Maybe a little reddish . - No , it was blond . - Straight or wavy ? - Straight . - Wavy . Any distinguishing features ? Scars ? Facial hair ? - What kind of shoes was he wearing ? - Shoes ? All I saw was the gun . I couldn 't even tell you if the guy had feet . - [ Laughter ] - This is a highly charged situation . Your adrenaline is pumping . Here 's my point . That even the most brilliant minds ... - can miss a thing or two . - [ Woman ] Speak for yourself . Your killer , Jarod , was a white male , 6 ' 1 " , 170 . He had straight brown hair . Blond ... if you count the cheesy shampooed-in highlights . And except for the played-out 90210 sideburns , he was clean shaven . Clothing-wise , and that 's where the real crime was committed ... he wore an off-the-rack J.C. Penny special , charcoal gray ... with lapels that screamed Bush administration . Oh , and start your manhunt in the Financial Aid office ... because nobody with even 10 bucks in their pockets ... would be seen wearing those shoes . - [ All Chuckle ] - [ Jarod ] Very good , Miss - - Dunning , Claire . - Ah , yes . Top of the Vanguard class . Grady and Matthew here were close , but , uh , no cigar though . Even with their vast intellect , it would be pretty difficult ... to keep up with someone who joined Mensa at age 13 . I 'm kinda curious as to your qualifications , Doc . Well , you frame a couple of diplomas , you slap your name on a few dissertations ... and voilà , people think you 're a genius . So , what kind of genius surprises are we in for next ? Something that will help us delve into the criminal mind . This class has been put on hold since your last professor ... Alden Clark , disappeared . Now , I thought , wouldn 't it be provocative ... if we all solved the mystery ofhis disappearance ? He cleaned out his bank account and ran off with his mistress . Maybe . Maybe not . This is Professor Clark 's book ... The Perfect Murder . Now , what if Professor Clark didn 't run off with his mistress ? What if , for argument 's sake , that he himself ... was the victim of ... the perfect murder . - [ Miss Parker ] If murder were legal , Broots ? - [ Broots ] Huh ? Your tip on Jarod ? False alarm . Sweeper team came up empty . Oh , well , that - Oh , I see , so kill the messenger ? Well , that 's your first usable idea in weeks . Broots , do you know who that man speaking with my father is ? Yeah , he 's a doctor . I just rode up with him on the elevator . - Doctor ? - Yeah . - Changing his will . - Huh ? Something the matter , Miss Parker ? There you go . [ Baby Gurgles ] Mrs. Clark . If you 're another bill collector , you can save your breath . Not even the house is mine anymore . Actually , my name is Jarod Gardner . I 'm taking over your husband 's classes at the university . [ Baby Cooing ] I 'm sorry . I 've been meaning to stop by and clear his things out of the office . I just haven 't been able to bring myself to do it yet . I understand . [ Chuckles ] Hi . They 're so fragile and so innocent . Yet , with one look , they can help you through anything . Why are you here , Dr. Gardner ? To help . Alden and I used to dream about the day our children would ... run around this yard . It must be very difficult to be the only one who still believes in him . It 's been a year now . I don 't have any illusions that my husband is suddenly gonna walk back into my life ... but I need answers . I need something to tell our child , other than his father ran off with his girlfriend . Alden and I had a very difficult time getting pregnant . There was so much heartbreak . He wanted this baby so badly . There is no way he would have missed his son 's birth if he were still alive . [ Baby Gurgles ] The harsh reality is he left her . Alden Clark was having an affair . I found e-mail on his computer from his mistress , fantasies , plans for running away . None of it G-rated . Plus , he withdrew every last cent from their account the day he left . He had a baby on the way . It doesn 't make any sense . Look , I feel for Mrs. Clark and her child ... but sooner or later she needs to face the facts . No body , no sign of foul play . The man walked out . Now , Dr. Gardner , it 's only natural to want the facts about the man you 're replacing ... but I have 25 real cases to handle . That 's my harsh reality . Excuse me . [ Jarod ] So , you want to commit the perfect murder . How do you go about it ? Well ? Oh , come on . Use those brilliant minds of yours . Become a killer . A sociopath . Someone without compassion , without a conscience . This is sick . We 're talking about Professor Clark here . We should just leave it alone . No , I think we can stand to learn a great deal from this . So I 'm asking that you play along with me . I 'm willing to go along with any game you wanna play , Jarod . [ Students Chuckles ] At the risk of sounding like Claire , I 'm in . - I 'm in . - Me too . - Good . Then let 's begin . Name all the ways that you can kill someone . - Stabbing . - Stabbing . - Shooting . - Shooting . Very good . - Suffocation . - Suffocation . [ No Audible Dialogue ] There certainly are a lot of ways to kill somebody . But you still have to deal with the body . - I 'd bury it out in the woods somewhere . - [ Claire ] It 's too risky . You hear stories all the time about some hiker stumbling over a stiff . It 'd be smarter to make the perfect murder look like a suicide . You still end up with an investigation . If it 's not flawless , you 're screwed . So how would you deal with it , Claire ? The perfect murder isn 't a murder . It 's an accident . - Hmm . - She 's right . Plausible deniability . Make it look like an accident . Something that fits into the victim 's daily routine . If we 're talking about Dr. Clark , how about on the road up to his cabin ? - His cabin ? - Yeah , he had a cabin . He used to go up there ... in the mountains after school on Fridays . And he did disappear on a Friday . [ Young Sydney ] LatelyJarod 's been bored . We must find better ways to engage his intellect . Keep a brilliant mind from becoming idle . [ Young Jarod ] Sydney , I can 't do these anymore . These same problems , they 're so monotonous . - What are they doing ? - They 're just working on a new security system . Come on , Jarod . Back to work . [ Phone Rings ] - Hello . - Jarod , I just got your message . Alden wasn 't headed to the cabin the day he vanished . The students told me that he headed up to his cabin every Friday night to write . Well , he planned to go , but that was the Friday I found out I was pregnant . I called him at school , and he said he was coming right home to celebrate . That 's the last time I spoke to him . So , the police never searched the road up to your cabin . [ Mrs. Clark ] No . No , they didn 't . [ Chattering ] [ Woman ] We can use another flare over here , please . - [ Man ] Mark it off . - [ Man # 2 ] We 'll be right there . - You get around , Professor Gardner . - I just heard what happened . Got a call from an anonymous motorist . Guy stopped . Let his dog take a leak . Glanced down , spied the wreck . - Hmm . - Kinda feel for Mrs. Clark . It just goes from bad to worse for her . She told me he wasn 't headed up here the day he disappeared . That doesn 't surprise me . Especially finding these in the car . Plane tickets . Mazatlán . One for Clark , the other issued to a Karen Sweet . - We found these in the glove box . - The other woman ? Mm-hmm . We also found the 40,000 in cash Clark took from his account . And a six-pack of empty beer bottles . So you think he was headed up to his cabin to meet her ... had a few beers and lost control ? Yeah , the story 's clear . Clark died , the victim of a car accident . [ Mrs. Clark ] I guess part of me was still hoping . That 's only natural . You know , yesterday , I would have done anything to keep this house ... and memories . Now I 've got the money to stay . I 'm not sure I want to anymore . Don 't give up on your husband yet . I 'm doing the best I can . I really am . But now the plane tickets and the photographs . [ Scoffs ] What am I supposed to believe ? Believe what 's in your heart . [ Miss Parker ] Are you sure you 're all right , Daddy ? I never felt better . It 's amazing how we adapt ... to changes life throws at us . - Even the big ones . - Big ones ? Yeah , I always thought I 'd be frightened standing on the threshold , as it were ... but honestly , I made peace with a lot of things . Daddy , are - are you dying ? I know about the doctor , your will and the life insurance . - Oh , angel - - Please don 't lie to me . Not about this . Sweetie , read the labels . Hmm ? Vitamin " E , " Ginseng ... Viagra ? [ Chuckles ] I 'm in love , sweetheart . L-I feel like I 've been reborn . - What ? - Mm . Who is she ? Oh , no , I promised her she 'd be here when I told you . I don 't wanna start messing up this early in our engagement . Engagement ? Daddy , this is crazy . Oh , I know , I know . After all this time , your old man found somebody who makes him happy . Hmm ? - Pretty wild , isn 't it ? - What 's that , Claire ? - Pretty wild , isn 't it ? - What 's that , Claire ? Professor Clark turning up like that . Yeah , talk about him one day , he 's found the next . Makes you wonder . Wonder is a wonderful thing , Grady . How do you feel about it , Matthew ? Sad , I guess . I mean , Dr. Clark was our adviser . Well , I 'm just surprised that you 're all not more upset . Why be upset ? This will make the game so much more fun . - The game ? - In class . Now there are clues to follow . It 's no longer just theoretical . Now it 's real . Much more ... dangerous . You know , Jarod ... if you ever wanna get together ... pick each other 's brains . A little one-on-one ? - [ Squeaking ] - Careful , Claire . Don 't cross a line you can 't come back from . Oh , well . I guess my friends will have to do . See you in class . [ Claire Laughs ] Hey . [ Klaxon Blaring ] Jarod . [ Laughing ] [ Keys Clacking ] Hmm . Professor Clark disappears , and your grades take a nosedive . Something on your mind , Matthew ? What about you , Claire ? Feeling guilty about anything ? Hmm . I guess not . This is getting too creepy , don 't you think Professor Gardner ? If this really is the perfect murder - What if I told you it wasn 't the perfect murder ? What if I told you that our killer made a very serious mistake . You 're not just toying with us now , are you , Jarod ? Professor Clark 's body ... it was recovered on the road to his cabin ... but he wasn 't going to his cabin that Friday night . He was going home . He changed his routine . But the killer didn 't know that . - So what next ? - We go back to the scene of the crime . You wanna fake a car crash . How do you do it ? Do you run the professor 's car off the road ? Do you cut his brake line ? Or maybe you just drug him . Well , ramming the car would leave paint evidence ... and cutting the brakes would be way too obvious . And drugs would be found in an autopsy . Not necessarily . Right , uh , Matthew ? Well , l-I don 't know . Oh , come on . You 're the ace of your biochemistry class , aren 't you ? Why don 't you tell everyone what dimethylphenol is ? - Um , it 's a heavy sedative . - And it metabolizes in the body how ? The same as alcohol . It has the same chemical signature . So , a shot of DMP , it would knock the victim out . But if anybody checked , it would show up in the blood no different ... than , let 's say , a few beers . Okay , so maybe we 've got the how . What about the why ? The motivation . Why would somebody wanna kill somebody ? Tomorrow in class , we 'll do a little role-playing exercise ... that will help us discover this motivation . Uh , Richard , you can play the cop . And , Gwen , you can be the other woman . And , um ... you , Claire , you 're the killer . But you had accomplices . How about , uh , you , Grady ? And you , Matthew . Strictly theoretical , of course . This is , after all , just a game . Let the games begin . [ Rat Squeaking ] [ Young Sydney ] Did you think you 'd get away with it ? I just get so bored sometimes , Sydney . A sharp mind left idle can become a very sharp weapon indeed . You gonna come in , Doc ? Or do you just like to watch ? Interesting experiment . There 's no way the rat can win . Every turn leads nowhere . No reward , no way out . - Seems pointless . - Maybe that is the point . He with the biggest brain wins . Is that it ? Or she . Certainly not them . Their tiny brains can barely think . So , round and round they go , chasing their tails forever . Very cruel , Miss Dunning . Although I can 't believe a rigged game doesn 't bore you . Once in a while ... even the dumber animals do something unpredictable . Something that catches you off guard . And that 's when it really gets fun . Fun , till you get bitten . I haven 't been bitten yet . Yet , being the operative word . Everyone 's gotta go sometime . The question is - Who will go first ? Which brings us back to - the biggest brain rules . The superior mind always has a way out . Tiny little door marked " Exit . " Well , maybe it 's time to run for it . - [ Rat Squeaking ] - Oh , uh , Jarod . [ Camera Whirs ] I 'll keep it in my glove box . Just like Professor Clark . [ Miss Parker ] I just don 't get it , Sydney . He hasn 't so much as looked at another woman ... since the day my mother died . And now , just like that , he decides he 's replacing her . No , he 's not replacing her . Your father has lived alone a long time . It 's only natural for him to reach out again . You sound like you 're on his side . There are no sides here . You must let him move on with his life . I 'm sorry it 's painful for you . It often is for the children involved . - I 'm not a child . - Then you know what you must do . Professor Clark said in his book ... that motive springs from that bottomless pit called the human psyche . That no matter how deeply you dig , you never exhaust it . Let 's do right by him , shall we ? Let 's figure out why ... he was killed . Let 's start with the police . Richard , you 're our cop . What do they think ? Statistically , money and jealousy top the list . It could have been a robbery . Except the 40,000 was left in the car . So jealousy then . Another teacher with a gripe against Professor Clark . [ Gwen ] Or his wife , if she knew about the affair . It could be something as simple as road rage . No , that 's spontaneous . This was planned . Well , we 're in a unique position here today ... because we have the killers in our class . Why don 't we ask them ? - Matthew . - Yeah . Why would you murder someone ? - Maybe I didn 't like him . - If you don 't like someone , you avoid them . If you see them walking down the street , you walk to the other side . You don 't send them careening off a cliff . Grady , any thoughts ? I don 't know . Why does anyone murder ? I 'm not asking anyone . I 'm asking you . So , dig down deep into that bottomless pit of yours and tell us why would you kill . - Well , uh - - Hello ? There are a million reasons to kill . Revenge . Revolt . Release . Superstition . Paranoia . Bad debt . Bad childhood . Bad hair day . [ Jarod ] I 'm afraid you 've missed the most relevant one . Arrogance . You see , our killers , they think they 're smarter than the rest of us ... and that this is all a game . That 's the reason they have accomplices . What fun is it to commit the perfect murder ... if you don 't have someone to gloat over it with ? But arrogancejust may be their downfall . Professor Clark says in his book that the perfect murder ... is committed by one person alone . - Why is that ? - Because accomplices can be unpredictable . Exactly . You never know what they might do ... how they might react . Take our role players over here . What if one of them couldn 't take the pressure and crumbled ? What if one of them went to the police and cut a deal ? Aren 't you getting a little ahead of yourself , Jarod ? I mean , there 's no evidence that Professor Clark 's death was anything but an accident . Well , quite obviously , you haven 't spoken to the police today . I talked to the detective in charge of this case ... and he 's convinced that the Polaroids in the glove compartment were fakes ... along with the e-mail and any other evidence ... that might suggest that there was another woman . As of today ... Professor Clark 's death was reclassified ... as a homicide . [ Murmuring ] As a matter of fact , Detective Rusk thinks ... the killer may even be right here in the classroom . [ Murmuring ] Well , that 's all for today . See you the next time . - Not if I see you first . - Come on , Claire . Let 's go . Please . Please ? [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue Continues ] [ Phones Ringing ] Whoa , whoa , whoa . Excuse me . You need a special pass to get back here . - I just have a delivery . - For who ? - Detective Rusk . - I 'll take it . - Are you sure ? - Trust me . It 's in the right hands . Cool . Thanks . [ Jarod ] " Take Polaroids ofhooker to plant in glove box . " Hack into Clark 's bank account . Get dimethylphenol from the chem lab . " It goes on and on . And it 's all in your handwriting . You might wanna refresh yourself , Matthew . It 's been a long time since you murdered Professor Clark . - Where 'd you get this ? - In an envelope ... addressed to the Hanover Sheriff 's Department . Oh , there was a little note inside ... from a concerned citizen . Claire wouldn 't - She wouldn 't do this to me . And Grady . They 're my friends . And you 're their patsy . You see this baby , Matthew ? He 'll never know who his father is . Not for a second . Not ever . And his mother , she agonized for months ... wondering when he was coming home ... until they discovered that he was dead . We were just sitting around talking one night . Getting drunk . You know ? We were just tossing out ideas on how to pull it off . It was just a game . When I walked into class that day , and Professor Clark wasn 't there ... Claire just started to laugh . She said , " What good is building the perfect toy ... if you 're not gonna play with it ? " - She and Grady actually killed him . - And you ? You sat around and you did nothing . I was afraid ! What was I supposed to do ? Claire 's my best friend . And I didn 't want her to be mad at me . The game is over , Matthew . It 's time to do the right thing . - Where 's Matthew ? - By now , probably some prisoner 's wife . But once he starts talking , they 're gonna come straight for us . So let them . As long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants dry ... no one can touch us . Good morning , Claire . Grady . Professor Gardner ! Professor ! - Richard , is something wrong ? - Matthew Collins is dead . He killed himself . [ Fizzing ] - They bought my suicide ? - Hook , line and sinker . I don 't quite understand what you 're going to do . I 'm going to murder them ... perfectly . [ Rolling Thunder ] I 'm telling you . It couldn 't have worked out better if we planned it this way . [ Laughs ] Oh , wait , we did plan it this way . Matthew is dead . He wasn 't up to our level , Grady . What he did is only proof of that . - [ Door Opens ] - What the hell are you doing here ? I hope I 'm not too late for the party . - We 're mourning our friend , Professor . - I know . That 's why I brought his favorite beer . So we could pay our respects . - Matthew would want it this way . - [ Opens Bottle ] Go ahead . - To the biggest brain . - To , uh , rats in a maze . - [ Bottles Clink Together ] - Like Matthew , your backup plan . - Your little door marked " Exit . " - May he rest in peace . - [ Laughs ] - What 's so funny ? You really think this is over , don 't you ? Well , it is , isn 't it ? Sure , the exit door is open , but where does it lead ? [ Quiet Chuckle ] I 've a little backup plan too . - Nighty-night . - [ Groans ] Claire , no sleeping in class . Claire , wake up . There you are . You were out for so long , I was getting worried about you . - What the hell - - I 'll take this . Wouldn 't want you smudging your fingerprints . Careful . That chair 's a little wobbly . One false move and - [ Gags ] It 's not exactly what I had in mind when I said ... we should be alone together . We 're not alone ... are we , Grady ? Wh-What is this ? Is this supposed to be a joke ? Oh , come on , Claire . I know you 're full of yourself ... but did you really think that you were the only person in the world ... that could pull off the perfect murder ? This isn 't funny . Let us go , Jarod . You know , a teacher is very lucky if he can learn as much from his students ... as they learn from him . In your case , I hit the jackpot . Especially with all the mistakes you made . Matthew being one of them . - Oh , by the way , he 's still alive . - [ Cocks Gun ] Faking his suicide was all part of my plan . [ Imitates Gunshot ] What ? You want us to talk ? Is that it ? Fine , I 'll talk . Grady , shut up . Ajury could never convict us . If you were going to court . But you 're not . I 'm the onlyjudge that matters now , so let 's examine the evidence . First , in all your planning , you forgot one very important thing . Professor Clark had a family . He had a baby on the way ... and a wife who never stopped believing in him . You two , on the other hand , you only have each other . Before the tragedy , that is . - What tragedy ? - Don 't play dumb , Claire . It 's all in your suicide note . It says in here how you and Grady killed Professor Clark . But grieving for the loss of his friend Matthew , Grady cracked under pressure ... and wanted to go to the police and confess . So you - [ Imitates Gunshot ] Killed him . And then you hung yourself , because you couldn 't face the utter futility and remorse . Brilliant minds . They 're so fragile . - They 'll know it 's not my handwriting . - But it is . You see , I found these notes that you wrote Professor Clark in his files ... and I traced over various words and voilà . Suicide note . Gun with your fingerprints . It 's ... perfect . - Go to hell . - You first . - Actually , Grady first . - [ Cocks Gun ] - Murder before suicide . - Wait ! Wait ! - I 'll tell you whatever you wanna hear ! - Shut up , Grady . He won 't do it . The bullet 's just a blank . Oh , you think so ? [ Grady ] Please , Jarod . Oh , God , no ! Come on , Claire , it 's over ! [ Whimpering ] Okay , we did it ! We murdered Professor Clark ! Partly it was thrill , but mostly Claire was mad at him because he wouldn 't sleep with her ! - Shut up , Grady . - Just don 't kill me . As far as I 'm concerned , you 're dead already . No ! Well , well , well , well , well . What do you know ? It was a bluff . But one that wasn 't missed by the camera . All your talk about the perfect murder . All your claims as to how extraordinary you are . You killed Professor Clark because he spurned you . You 're no genius . You 're as common as they come . [ Grunts ] [ Claire ] Jarod . Jarod ! [ Miss Parker ] Daddy , I 've come with a little peace offering . [ Woman Laughing ] Hello ? - [ Laughing Continues ] - Who 's in my father 's private washroom ? [ Water Running ] Daddy . Oh , my God . Hi , Miss Parker . [ Giggles ] - Not Bridget . - Look . I 'm gonna be your new mommy . You 're gonna marry the bi - The woman who tried to kill you ? Oh , come on , angel . Be happy for me . - Honey bunny . - Hmm ? - I 'm your new angel now . - Oh . [ Both Chuckling ] Hmm . [ Jarod ] So , how well do you think you know your father now , Miss Parker ? - Coming to the wedding ? - I 'm not big on brides in black leather . Although , there is a certain enjoyable irony in it . Funny , I 'm not seeing it . Oh , give her a chance . A chance to what ? Suck the rest of the life out of my father ? Love can change people , Miss Parker . - [ Phone Beeps ] - [ Chuckles ] [ Dial Tone , Beeps ] We miss you , Alden . Chinese elm . Alden 's favorite . - It 's beautiful . - Mm . I know someone who 's ready to climb it already . Come here . Hello . Yes . Oh , Jarod , you 've given us so much . The chance to bury Alden . Our home . - I just wish I could have given it all back to you . - You 've given us the truth . Nothing mattered more to Alden than that . Thank you . I just want to know how you knew all along . I mean , even when I had doubts . The truth was always in your husband 's book . In the dedication . " To Chris : Whom I 've been waiting to meet for so very long . " Good luck . Bye , Chris .

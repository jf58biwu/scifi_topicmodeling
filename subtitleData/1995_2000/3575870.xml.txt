 Justine ? Justine ? GIRL : Somebody there ? Justine ? I 'm coming . Please hurry . Okay . Hang on there , honey . All right , just hang on . How are you ? Okay . Yeah ? You , uh , you came out here on a dare , huh ? Yeah . Okay . You want to come here ? All right ? ( creaking ) Whoa . Just stay right there . Okay now . I 'm scared . I know , I know . All right . Okay . Okay , it 's all right . Come on , I got you . Come on . Got you . Come on . Okay , hang on a second . Let me ... let me get up front . Okay . ( grunts ) You get over ? All right , just turn around . Just turn around ... All right , you ready ? No . Let 's go . Huh ? I can 't leave without Harriet . I 've had her since I was a kid . Your bear ? My teddy bear . All right , hang on a second . Let me get Harriet for you . You got her ! I got her . Hang onto Harriet here . ( creaking ) ( yells ) No ! ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * Good morning . ( groaning ) Get my wheelchair , would you ? All right . Okay . You had to save the teddy bear , huh ? ( groans ) Mm-hmm . I told you I didn 't fall because of the teddy bear . I saw that ... ( both groan ) ... girl . Oh , yeah , blame it on a girl . Always blaming it on a girl . It 's like an oven in here . That 's because the radiator 's broken . Everything 's broken around here ! ( grunts ) And I did see that girl . All right , follow my logic . You saw the girl , you looked away . What are you doing , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . So ... you saw the girl , okay , you looked away for a second , and then when you turned back , she was gone . Gary , you were on a scaffolding , so unless Siegfried and Roy were involved , the whole thing sounds a little iffy . Where do you want to go ? I want to go open the window . Oh , w-w-w-whoa . What , what , what ? Aah ! I got an itch . All right , w-w- - ? Aah , my toe . Which toe is it ? Is it the , uh , is it the little piggy ? How 's the patient ? Grouchy . Fine . Oh , dear . Now , look , if you want anything else , uh , scratched , sniffed , wiped , or schlepped , you ask her because I got work to do . Wait a second . Oh , no , no , no , no . Duty calls , my friend , come on . I am busy today . I 'm hiring a new waitress . Well , I can hire the new waitress . You cannot hire the new waitress . Besides , I am not your errand boy . GARY : Says the victim was scantily clad in a bathing suit . That sounds like a bikini to me . Scantily clad bikini ? Scantily clad . " Woman drowns in community pool . " That 's , of course , unless some hunk of manhood happens to come by and save her . Tell you what . I 'll take care of this one , but just this once . But don 't get used to it . Okay . ( radiator clanking ) NARRATOR : In the heat of the Mojave Desert , the female scorpion scuttles across the burning sand towards a waiting male . She lures him with a mating dance that will become , for the unsuspecting male , a dance of death . When the mating ritual is complete in , uh , shirts and also in skirts for you , and I do have a real quick preview to whet your appetite , as they say . We 're going to ... Beautiful babes on the beach . They 're not women . They 're men ! ( crowd cheering ) ( breathes deeply ) ( no audio ) Yabba , yabba , yabba , yabba . Geez ... ( no audio ) ( steam hissing ) That 's her . Shut up . ( sighs ) ( splashing ) " Cleo Gaylord , 29 , drowned when her foot was caught in a drain . " Cleo . ( sighs ) ( clears throat ) Uh , Cleo ? Cleo Gaylord ? No . No ? ( indistinct chatter ) Um , excuse me . Are , uh , are either one of you , uh , Cleo Gaylord ? No . Never heard of her . No ? Weirdo . I know . ( yelps ) ( splashing ) Oh , no . Yah ! Gare ! Hm ... ? Flapping thighs . Big , huge , milky-white , flapping thighs . What are you talking about ? The indoor pool , remember ? Instead of a scantily clad bikini , ( door opening ) all I got was Moby Dick ! ( knocking ) Excuse me , guys . You , uh , want to meet the new waitress ? Bring her in , please , Marissa . All right , um ... Come on in . Uh , Gary , Chuck , meet the new waitress Anne . Hi . You 're her . CHUCK : Yeah , that 's right , our new waitress . Hi . Chuck Fishman . Welcome to McGinty 's . Thanks . Ah ... we ... We met the other day , uh , sort of . Sorry ? That , that was me , uh , in the lakefront building on the scaffolding . Um ... Marissa , why don 't you take ... Anne . ... Anne downstairs ? No , th-the building with the little girl . It was just no more than two days ago . That-that 's impossible . I just moved here from Muncie yesterday , so ... Yeah , well , he 's not feeling very well . That and the Darvocet that he 's on ... No , w-wait a second . W-Why ... Did you move to the Windy City ? We do that ; we finish each other 's sentences . That 's why we 're partners . You 'll start enjoying us . ( Chuck and Anne chuckle ) Right . Um , well , my grandmother and my mother used to live here , and I just finished school , so I figured now or never , right ? So , I ... I moved across the street . Across the street ? MARISSA : I-I 'm sure you 'll like the place . Chicago 's a very friendly city . So , Marissa , why don 't you take Anne downstairs and , uh , start her on paperwork ? All right , come on , Anne . CHUCK : Be right down . MARISSA : All right . Nice to meet you . Bye . ( whispering ) : Gary . ( door closes ) It 's one thing to share your hallucinations with friends ... That was not a hallucination . All right , your delusions then . Look , that girl wants to be our new waitress , and whether she knows it or not , she wants to date me , so don 't blow it . Look , I-I saw her . I-I saw her . She was dressed a little bit differently , her hair was a little bit different , but that was the girl . That was the same girl . Yeah ? I saw that girl in that building across this very street . Wow . I never noticed you can see everything from here . What is she , a model or something ? No , a flight attendant . Yeah ? CHUCK : That woman has a remarkable set of pecs . Don 't you think that it 's a little strange that she should show up here ? Gare , I think she 's going to take a shower . Well , look , will you listen to me here ? Gary , it 's very simple . What you 're doing here is a Rear Window . Huh ? Hitchcock 's Rear Window , where Jimmy Stewart breaks his leg , he sits around all day in his apartment , spying on his neighbors . That 's it ? Well , one of ' em ends up being a murderer . It 's a cheery film . * * ( quietly ) : Marissa ... Mari ... ! ( bell jangles ) Marissa ! Marissa ! Marissa ! What 's wrong ? Look , I just saw , I just saw a guy break into , uh , what 's her name , Anne 's apartment . You saw what ? I just saw a guy in that building break into our new waitress apartment . Wait a minute . What were you doing looking in Anne 's apartment ? Well , well , it , it was hot in here , and so I went to the window . When I opened it up , I look across the way , and ... Let me guess : you just accidentally happened to see a girl in the window ? Well , forget about what I was doing . What 's he doing in our new waitress ' apartment ? Well , you tell me . You know , I saw , I saw the guy this morning . He was arguing with his wife , you know , a real knock-down , drag-out , and all of a sudden , he 's in her apartment . So ... now what 's that all about ? I ... Well , wait . How much medication have you been taking , Gary ? Who are you calling ? I 'm gonna call our new waitress . Okay . And , uh , what are you gonna tell her ? I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna tell her . I 'm gonna tell her exactly what I should tell her . I 'm , I 'm ... Hello , Anne ? This is Gary Hobson . Uh , I , I was just calling to tell you that ... Well , I ... Well , I , I wanted to tell you that Muncie isn 't as big as Chicago , and that you should keep your doors locked , and ... No , that was all . I ... Well , sure , I ... I 'll , yeah , I 'll see you at work . Good-bye . ( line clicks , dial tone ) That was great . Anything else you want to tell me ? No . All right , well , hey , I ... You sure you 're okay ? Yeah . All right . If you need me , I 'll be in the office . ( swing music playing , people whooping ) ( cat meows , newspaper thuds onto floor ) ( cat meows ) * * * * ( no audio ) ( phone rings ) Crumb , it 's me , Gary . Look , get up and get over here right now . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , slow down , Hobson slow down . I can 't slow down . I 'm watching a girl in the apartment across the street right now , and she is in big trouble . You gotta get over here . You 're watching some girl across the street ? No , it 's the new waitress . Okay , okay , so you 're watching one of your employees in her apartment . Well , it 's not like that . What do you make me out to be , a pervert or something ? Oh , no , I wouldn 't do that . What are you using , telescope or binoculars ? Binocu- - What does that have to do with it , Crumb ? I 'm just curious . Look , I 'm telling you , she 's gonna be shot . Who ? The waitress ! Someone is conspiring to kill your waitress ? That 's what I 've been trying to tell you ! Now , how exactly do you know this ? Listen to me . Yesterday , I saw the guy sneak into her apartment . This morning , I see the same guy selling a gun to a neighbor . What kind of gun ? Well , it was ... Well , it was a gun ! A gun gun . I don 't know , the kind that goes bang . Oh , as opposed to one that goes , say , uh , woof-woof ? Listen , Crumb , I saw the guy . He gave him cash . You sure ? Look , Crumb , I know you 're not a cop anymore , but you can make a citizen 's arrest , can 't you ? What 's the address ? What 's going on ? I don 't know . It looks like the , the guy that broke into her apartment is telling the younger guy something . He 's telling him to shoot her in the head . MARISSA : My God ! CHUCK : Why would they want to kill a girl from Muncie ? I don 't know . Wait a second . There 's Crumb . GARY : Got him ! He got him ! I got it . It 's not Rear Window ; it 's Body Double . The stewardess across the street is Melanie Griffith . What ? The old man paid her to draw your attention to that building so that you would witness them plotting a murder . But if they were plotting a murder , then why would they want a witness ? Because this is Gaslight and you , my friend , are Ingrid Bergman . And the , the mystery man is James Mason . Anne was in that building , but she denied it because she wants you to think that you 're crazy . Why ? Why ? I 'll tell you why . Because then , when Anne does commit the murder , you lose all credibility . No one believes you . And Anne , she collects all the insurance money , and she goes off to Mexico , to Oaxaca or someplace . Chuck , that 's not Body Double , that 's Body Heat . Body Heat , Body Double , I 'm - I 'm spit-balling here , baby . I 'm , uh , I 'm , uh , my creative juices are flowing . I should have been a writer myself . ( knocking ) Come in , please . Hobson . Crumb . What 'd you do ? What , did you just give ' em over to the police , or what ? No . But you did get ' em , right ? Yeah , you wanna see ? CHUCK : They 're here ? Yeah . They want to meet the Peeping Tom . CRUMB : Mr. Malone ! This is your gunman , Ray Malone . Looks kinda scary , don 't he ? Tell ' em what you do for a living , Ray . I write mysteries . CHUCK : Oh , so a writer can 't be a murderer ? Wait , wait , wait a second . I ... I saw you buy a gun . I was plotting a book , not a crime . A book ? Oh , all right , what about the other guy ? The other guy , I saw him break into Anne 's apartment , I 'm telling you . Yeah . Mr. Sinclair ! This is Anne 's landlord , Lou Sinclair . Landlord . Landlord . Huh . Huh . I-I suppose you were in Anne 's apartment because , uh ... My last tenant had a problem with the outlets . I wanted to make sure they were fixed . Well , I guess that particular crime would be found in the Criminal Code under , uh , " Thoughtful Behavior " ? It looks like I-I owe you an apology . Sure does , Gare . A word of advice , Hobson , uh , if you 're interested . Colonel Mustard in the conservatory with a candlestick . Thank you . Now , next time you junior detectives get a bright idea , do me a favor : don 't call me . ( door shuts ) Whoops . Wait a second . The paper says Anne 's gonna be shot . The paper 's never wrong . Are you sure you read it right ? Well , of course I read it right . Here , it 's right here . " Woman Shot To Death . " Uh , Gare , I think we have a little problem here . MARISSA : What is it ? This paper 's from 1944 . I don 't believe this . Me neither . I was just getting used to tomorrow 's newspaper today . That paper 's over 50 years old . So , what is it doing here ? She was telling the truth . Truth about what ? It wasn 't her that I saw in that building . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . It was this woman- - Daria . Who 's Daria ? " Miss Daria DeLongpre , 24 , " popular USO hostess , was shot to death last night at McGinty 's Bar . " Whoa . CHUCK : McGinty 's ? GARY : " One of the city 's most popular USO night spots . " Miss DeLongpre had spent the evening dancing " with a number of servicemen , " several of whom have been taken in for questioning . " No murder weapon was recovered from the scene , although police believe it to be a small-caliber revolver . " Is that true ? My grandmother was murdered ? Sorry , Anne . The resemblance is amazing . ANNE : I can 't believe this . It happened right here . Who killed her ? Well , I went online to the newspaper archives , and apparently , the police never found the killer . This is so strange . You didn 't , you didn 't know anything about this at all ? ANNE : No ! My grandfather died in World War II and my mother always told me when I was growing up that my grandmother , Daria , was killed in a car accident . So you , so you get in touch with your mom . No , she died when I was nine . Why wouldn 't she tell me that ? Maybe because you were a kid . Maybe . What- - does it say anything about my grandfather in there ? According to this paper , your grandmother was never married . Well , of course she was . No , they got married a month before he got shipped off to the Pacific , okay ? That much I know . My grandmother was married . I mean , she had to be . Right ? I ... How else do you explain my mother ? Oh . Okay , so my grandmother was a single mom , and my mother was ... Unlucky . ( sighs ) I gotta go . Uh , look , I know I just started work today , but if I ... No , that 's fine . Take as much time as you need . Thanks . I just ... I just need some time . Well , now all we have to do is find out who killed Daria . Daria ? Oh , you 're on a first name basis now ? Uh , ever since I 've had the accident , I 've been , uh ... ( clears throat ) dreaming about Daria . What ? Who ? Geez ! I 've got a question for you . How would you feel if you found out someone was obsessed with you , following you , watching your every move ? Who are you ? That 's good . That 's really good . You were scared but at the same time you were angry , strong . I like that . I like that a lot . What are you doing ? Oh , we haven 't met : I 'm Raymond Malone . I 'm from 2B ; I 'm the mystery writer . I 'm doing some research . Research ? May I ask you a few more questions ? No ! ( door slams , lock clicks ) GARY : Can you believe all this USO stuff we found in the basement ? Old man McGinty was a major pack rat . He saved everything . Is there anything else down there ? Yeah . About 50 more boxes like this one . Well , go get them . What ? Research . Are you nuts ? Have you been down to the basement lately ? I go down there one more time , I 'm gonna catch hantavirus ! Hey , guys . What did the police say ? Well , they said , uh , unsolved murder cases are never closed and they give it a token review once a year , but , uh , they 're no closer to solving this than they were 50 years ago . GARY : Did you hear from Anne ? Nope . What about , uh , Daria ? Am I the only rational person here ? Dead people do not communicate with the living- - that is one of the qualifications of being dead . MARISSA : Well , maybe there are some things that can 't be explained , Chuck . It 's like Gary said , maybe Daria wants his help . Maybe she 's trying to tell him something . Maybe she wants him to do something . Like what , order room service ? I was thinking more along the lines of laying her soul to rest . Right . WOMAN : * It seems we stood * * And talked like this before * * We looked at each other in the same way then * * But I can 't remember * * Where or when ... * * Some things that happen * * For the first time ... * * Seem to be ... * * Happening again * * And so it seems * * That we have met before ... * CHUCK : Gare ? ( moaning ) Gare , get up . ( groaning ) What are you ... Morning . Hey . Hey ... I just had a dream about Daria . She was trying to tell me something . That 's funny . I had a dream about the new waitress . She was trying to tell me something . No , no , no , this ... " Some things that happen for the first time ... seem to be happening again . " You know what , buddy ? We gotta get you some fresh air immediately . No , no , no , it 's a song . ( cat meowing ) It 's a ... ( newspaper thuds onto floor ) Get the paper ! Listen , that ... Get the paper ! that thing happened over 50 years ago . You see , I ... GARY : I think there 's a connection between ... ( cat meows , Gary grunts with effort ) GARY : ... the past and now . You 're not gonna believe this . Why ? What 's it say ? What 's the date ? Tomorrow . No one 's home . Well , you could call Crumb . What ? After yesterday ? Look , the paper says that she 's killed in her apartment , right ? Right . So , isn 't it obvious ? All we have to do is stop her from going into her apartment . Well , how am I gonna do that ? I can 't even get down the stairs . You want me to go across the street to ... Oh , no , no , no , no . No , no , now listen , now all you gotta do is , you take the cell phone over there and you stand by the door . That 's it . Look , this does not play into my strengths , all right ? Mad killers ? You see that movie Body Double ? Remember , the woman was murdered . Impaled with a six-inch power drill . But I thought you liked her . I do . I love her . Well , then you could save her life . I mean , I bet she 'd like the guy who did that . Hmm . A date with Anne or impaled by a six-foot power drill . Come on ! All right . I 'll do it for our children . Attaboy . You got my cell phone number , right ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . She hasn 't been home all day , and look at this . It 's still there . Well , you did everything you can , Gary . No , there 's gotta be something . There 's gotta be something that we 're missing . Like what ? ( cat meows ) Go on , get outta here , would ya ? Like this . MARISSA : You found something ? I think I know who 's gonna kill Anne . ( with British accent ) : Fishman . Charles Fishman . ( grunting ) MARISSA : Back up a minute . You 're telling me that Lou is gonna kill Anne because ... ? Because Lou killed Daria . " Things that happen for the first time seem to be happening again . " Wait , wait , wait , you 're losing me , Gary . Look , 50 years ago , Lou killed Daria . Why would he do that ? Well , I don 't know . Why do people kill each other ? Jealousy , money , who knows ? But I do know that he 's in this picture and that tells me it 's gotta be him . Why ? W-What ? Look , it fits . 50 years ago , he kills a woman and he thinks he 's gotten away with it all this time . Well , all of a sudden , her granddaughter shows up in his building . She 's the spitting image . Lou gets scared . GARY : That 's right . Breaks into her apartment to find out what she knows . So , he thinks the only reason for her to move to Chicago , living in his building ... That 's right- - because she knows who killed her grandmother . Not only that , but he knows she knows who killed her grandmother . And now he 's got no choice . So , he has to kill her to keep his secret . Yeah ... Don 't you think you should call Chuck ? Hmm ? Chuck . Chuck ! ( line ringing ) He 's not answering . ( phone ringing ) ( ringing continues ) CHUCK ( muffled ) : Hey ! ( muffled ) : Hey ... ! ( muffled ) : Hey , I 'm in ... She 's home . She 's home . ( busy signal ) ( whispering ) : What are you doing ? Come on , get off the phone . Get off the phone . What are you doing ? I 'll tell you what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna call Mr. Sinclair . I 'm going to let him know ... ( dialing ) ... what I know . Call Lou ? Well , what- - I don 't , I don 't get it , Gary . You got a better idea , let me know what it is right now . ( line ringing ) ( over phone ) : Hello . Hello ? I know what you 're going to do . Who is this ? Don 't kill her , Lou . You 're never going to get away with it . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Oh , you know exactly what I 'm talking about . You know ... ( whispering ) : Shut off the lights . Well , w-what happened ? Just shut off the lights . He saw me . Are , are you sure he saw you ? Go call Crumb . Crumb ? ! Gary , I ... Just go downstairs and call Crumb . All right , all right . ( dial tone ) Listen , I ... ( door creaks open ) Marissa ? * * You think I 'm going to kill that DeLongpre girl ? Listen to me , you stay right where you are . I know exactly what you 're up to , and I 've already called the police . You don 't know anything . Oh , I know you killed Daria DeLongpre . I didn 't kill Daria . I didn 't kill her , but I know who did . You do ? 1944- - I 'd been married three years . WOMAN : They 're gone . And each year was longer than the last . WOMAN : How could you give my coupons to some ... ? They have five kids , Norma . They had no heat . What kind of husband worries about everyone in the neighborhood but his own wife ? They were ours , and we 'll get by . I don 't want to " get by . " You get those back , you hear me ? ! I hear you , loud and clear . LOU : I used to come over here just to get out of the house , breathe some different air for a change , think my own thoughts . We hit it off right away . ( lively swing music playing ) We shared our sad stories . She had fallen in love with a marine a couple of years before . He was going to marry her , but he didn 't get the chance . He was killed in the South Pacific . Daria gave birth to a beautiful girl who would never know her daddy . Not a lot of sympathy for a single mom in 1944 , but that didn 't bother Daria . She loved that kid . Raised her all by herself . And you loved Daria . From the moment I met her , I felt like I could breathe again . For the first time in a long time , I wasn 't looking at the end of my life , and I came to a decision . I was going to divorce Norma and ask Daria to marry me . I 'd raise her child as my own . What I hadn 't counted on was Norma . You see , she 'd seen it all every night at the window . She knew . Where the hell have you been ? Out . You think I like sitting in this crummy apartment , night after night , while you 're out ? If you hate it so much , leave ! And so she , she wouldn 't give you the divorce ? Norma has a strong will , always has . Maybe that 's why I married her in the first place . One night I ... I had to work late , but Norma , she came over here , looking for Daria . She brought my gun . ( bright swing melody playing ) ( song ends ) I knew immediately what she had done . I was going to turn her in , but ... but then she told me . Told you what ? She was pregnant ; three months pregnant . How could I turn in the mother of my child ? So I 've lived with it for 50 years , hoping they 'd solve the murder , hoping they wouldn 't . Half a century goes by and then , one day , Daria is back , only it 's not her . It 's Anne . I was going to tell her everything . Today I even followed her , but I couldn 't . Lou , your wife- - is she home right now ? ( knocking on door ) Hold on a second . ( knocking ) Hi . Hello , dear . Hi , come on in . Brought you a little housewarming gift . Thank you . Here , wait , let me take those . Thank you . I 'm sorry , it 's my neighbor , okay ? Hang up the phone . Hang it up . O-Okay , wait a minute , just ... Norma , no ! No , Norma , you won 't do it again , Norma . Lou , get back , I 'm telling you to stay back . I 've got her . Put the gun down , Norma . Norma . Look , no , Norma , I , I won 't let you . I-I won 't let you . ( groans ) ANNE : Oh , no ! NORMA : Oh , no , Lou . What have you done ? Oh , Lou , no . I had to do it , Lou . I had to do it . She 's a tramp , just like the other one . She wanted to ruin us . Yeah , yeah , yeah , take it easy , lady . ( groaning ) ANNE : So ... I want to thank all of you for what you did . You know , when I left Muncie , they said no one in the big city is going to look out for you . They were wrong . You going to go home ? Yeah , for a while . So I saw Lou in the hospital this morning . I 've forgiven him for everything . He 's a good man . I think I know what my grandmother must have seen in him . And , uh , he gave me this . It 's a letter from one of the soldiers who served with my grandfather . I think you might be interested . Bye , Gary . Bye , Marissa . Bye . Hey , what about me ? What about you ? She loves me . Yeah . So , um , you gonna open it ? Hmm ? The letter . You gonna open it ? " Dear Miss DeLongpre , " I served with your fiancé Jimmy in Guadalcanal . " Please take a moment to let me explain . " There was a Japanese sneak attack at night . " Somehow Jimmy knew it before everyone else . " He had a sixth sense about that kind of thing . " He got everyone up , " and then took out eight of the enemy " before going down himself . " The second thing you need to know is " that Jimmy loved you very much . " You were his whole life , " and I hope these words bring you some comfort . " I 've enclosed a picture of Jimmy and some of the guys . " I hope you meet another guy like him someday . " Good luck . Corporal Sam Jones . " DARIA : * Some things that happen * * For the first time ... * * Seem to be happening * * Again * * And so it seems * * That we have met * * Before * * And laughed before * * And loved before * * But who knows * * Where ... * * Or when ? *

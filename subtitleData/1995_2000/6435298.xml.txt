 You make man . No . Woman . FRANKENSTEIN 'S MONSTER : Woman . [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science , ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , diagrams and charts , mending broken hearts and making weird science . Something like a recipe , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! No heart of gold- - just flesh and blood . I do not know . It 's my creation , ooo , my creation . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand ? It 's alive ! Alive ! [ MOANING ] My tongue is getting tired just watching those two . MAN ( ON TELEVISION ) : Why don 't you head back to my cabin and put on something a little skimpier ? I 'll just hang out a minute and swipe some brewskis from the cabins of one of our missing counselors . [ RATTLING ] Hey . What was that noise ? The wind blowing through the holes in the plot ? Here we go . The camera 's shaky . That means the killer is watching . How do you know so much about slasher movies ? They have their own set of rules . For example , rule number eight . Flashlight batteries always die at the worst possible moment . This guy is beef jerky . I thought you said you hadn 't seen this movie . Didn 't have to . I can predict anything that 'll happen in a slasher flick . Rule number six . Characters with healthy sex drives are machete magnets . Cool ! [ GRUNTING ] [ MOANING ] I 'll tell you , if I was in a slasher movie , there 's no way the bad guy would come out on top . Ooh , that sounds like fun . Of course , he doesn 't mean that literally . Just once I wish I could go up against one of those stupid slashers- - [ SIGH ] , Gary , shut up ! - -and show ' em who 's boss . Well , three cheers for Aladdin . Where are we ? We 're in the movie . You wished it . [ THUD ] [ GRUNT ] Oops . Hmm . Hmm . OK . You 've had your joke , Lis . Now , how about zapping us out of here ? Sorry . We can 't leave until the movie 's over . [ SCREAMING ] Lisa , he 's dead ! Really dead ! Come on , Wyatt . It 's not real . Lighten up . Yeah . This could be fun . This is your idea of fun ? Being stalked by a homicidal , kill-crazy maniac ? Relax , Wyatt . I 'm the world 's greatest expert on horror films . Nobody 's getting slashed while I 'm around . Wow , big fish . And what if you blow it ? Then we 're all dead . Anybody for s 'mores ? It 's queueing music . Lis , don 't open that door ! [ SCREAMS ] [ SCREAMING ] It 's Mittface ! [ SCREAMING ] Run ! Come on ! [ SNICK ] Ah ! My heel broke off . Rule 12 . High heels always break when a homicidal maniac is chasing you . But I wasn 't wearing high heels when we zapped in . Rule 11 . In these movies , women always wear high heels . Less talk . Let 's move ! He can 't be far behind ! We 're going to be OK . Look ! Ranger station . We 're saved . - Great ! Let 's go ! - Hup ! Not so fast . Another rule . Guys with guns and badges always die in the first 10 minutes . MITTFACE : [ SCREAM ] Hey , this cabin looks just like the other one . It 's a low budget movie . They just keep reusing the same cabin . If you 're so damn smart , figure out how to get us out of here . I want- - GIRLS : [ GIGGLING ] I want- - Wow . Your hair is so pretty . Thanks . I want to make sure we take full advantage of this fine new experience Lisa has given us . Ooh . Oh ! Oh ! Oo ! Oo ! Hee hee . [ KNOCKING ] I love this movie . Ah ! It 's in the bag ! [ SQUEALS ] Go , go , go . Hi , girls . Hi . I 'm Brittany , and this is Tiffany . Hi . I 'm Gary , and this is Wyatt , and that 's Lisa . I 'm Brittany , and this is Tiffany . No , wait . I 'm standing on the left . I 'm Tiffany . Hi . Oh , they 're lovely . You guys are cute . You want to take a shower and make out ? More than anything I can think of right now . [ DOOR OPENING ] Hey , ladies . Let 's get it on . Hi Rod . Hi , guys . Who wants to party ? [ BARKING IN UNISON ] Sure . We can go to the Indian burial grounds for a picnic . I know . Why don 't we all go skinny dipping in Lake Death ? It 's really dark and secluded , with a lot of neat places where you can jump out and scare somebody . Sure , baby . It 'll help take our minds off all the mysterious and grisly murders of the other camp counselors . GIRLS : Cool . What about our shower ? Heh . Sorry . He 's cuter . Oh , man . Dumped by a fictional character . Leave it to me , lover boys . I 'll keep the morons busy . Hey , fellas . Better idea . Let 's go out in the woods and play tag . Tag ? That 's for kids . You 've never played with me . You 're it . Tag it is . Let 's go , guys ! Yeah ! [ BARKING IN UNISON ] GIRLS : [ GIGGLING ] WYATT : Oh . Hi again . [ GIGGLING ] Hey , what 's the movie ? BOYS ( ON TELEVISION ) : [ BARKING IN UNISON ] [ SCREAMING ] Who cares ? All I could think about is you . This sure is a nice house . Thanks . It 's really all I can afford on a Colonel 's salary . I thought you were a major . Major-Colonel . It 's a new rank we 're trying out . Mm . So when are they shipping you out ? [ SIGH ] Tomorrow . 06 : 00 AM . I may not be coming back . Border wars are nasty business . Oh , that sounds horrible . Where are they sending you ? Canada . [ SIGH ] We 're at war with Canada ? Since when ? It 's a covert operation . God , I shouldn 't be telling you this . I could lose my damn commission . It 's just that I feel like there 's a connection here . It 's like , nobody knows me like you . And I want us to get closer . Oh , Billy . [ GIGGLES ] MITTFACE : [ HEAVY BREATHING ] Would either of you guys like an erotic massage ? OK . GIRLS : [ GIGGLING ] Hold on , stallion . I just remembered something very important . Well , hurry up and tell me so we can go mess around with the girls . OK . We can 't mess around with the girls . You didn 't just say that . I just remembered . Characters with active sex drives are- - Machete magnets . Oh . Ah . Mm . Mm . You mean to tell me we 're trapped in a cabin with two beautiful , scantily clad , totally willing girls , and we can 't close the deal ? I 'm telling you , Wyatt . Mittface is somewhere right outside on standby mode , waiting for us to break a rule . So no sex ? GIRLS : So how about it , guys ? [ GIGGLING ] No sex ? [ WHIMPERS ] [ COYOTE HOWLING ] Whew ! You know , when you said we were going to play tag , we didn 't think you meant actually playing tag . I don 't follow you . Well , you know . A babe like you , a stud like me . I was thinking we could do a little parallel parking . [ LAUGHS ] I 'm sorry . But you could only hear a line like that in a bad movie . A babe like you and a stud like me , I was thinking we could do a little parallel parking . That 's not a very soldierly way to talk . Oh , that 's just knowing that this time tomorrow , my bullet-riddled body could be staring up at that unforgiving Saskatchewan sunset . My last thoughts would be of you , my precious Karen . Sharon . See ? I don 't know what I 'm saying . [ CRIES ] So ? How about it ? I 'm hot . [ GRUNTS ] Rule 17 . Window stripteases are fatal . That looks fun ! [ GIGGLES ] You can tackle me . Brittany , no ! [ SCREAMING ] [ WINDOW BREAKING ] OK . We 're not being clear . We want to have sex . Oh , go right ahead . Um , no . With you . Oh . You want me to watch ? Maybe give you a little feedback ? A few notes ? OK . Let 's back up and start again . - - [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] That 's out of the park . Shoo ! Shoo ! Shoo ! Wyatt ! I need a better weapon ! Uh ! Get the chainsaw out of the closet ! Why would there be a chainsaw in the closet ? There 's always a chainsaw in the closet ! Groovy . [ SCREAMING ] [ CHAINSAW RUNNING ] Aah ! [ SCREAMING ] Ooh . He won 't be doing chin-ups any time soon . Important safety lesson , girls . The tops stay on . One , two , three , break ! OK . This time we got it . Me and my buddies here want you to get naked and roll around with all of us , also naked , and have lots of hot , noisy sex . Please . Oh , that is so sweet . I just wish you 'd thought of this before you got all sweaty playing tag . But- - Tell you what . Why don 't you boys go grab a bar of Safeguard and go freshen up . What do you say , guys ? Quick skinny dip in Lake Death ? [ HOWLING IN UNISON ] Do you think you could make that much noise all the way down to the lake ? It really turns me on . [ HOWLING AND BARKING IN UNISON ] But be careful . Mittface might hear you . [ HEAVY BREATHING ] It 's OK . You can tell me . No . You 'll laugh . Please . It 's too embarrassing . [ SOBBING ] Shh . Sh . Sh . It 's OK . I 'm here for you , Billy . I 'm going to have to die tomorrow . And I 'm scared . Scared of dying a virgin . [ GASP ] No . Oh , God . I can 't believe I said that out loud . You must think I 'm terrible . I mean , I couldn 't possibly ask you to- - I mean , sure it is a dying man 's last request and all , but I wouldn 't want to put you- - Shut up and kiss me , you was brave thing . Okey dokey . Mm . [ HAMMERING ] [ DOORKNOB RATTLING ] [ SCREAMING ] Ah ! [ SCREAMING ] Damn door was stuck . Quick , close the door ! We 've got no idea where Mittface is . [ SCREAMING ] Down by Lake Death , maybe ? Good . Now we 've got time to slasher-proof this place . Nobody 's going to keep us from spending some quality time with Brit and Tiff . Mm . Mm . Oh . Mm . [ SQUEAKY NOISES ] Come on . We 've got to do the kitchen windows . Oh , the boys are gone . Now we can 't have sex . This stinks . You two are pathetic . You spend the entire movie in bikinis for no apparent reason , and you can 't remember which one of you is which . You 're a disgrace to your gender . She 's mean . That 's why I like boys . OK , girls . We need to talk . [ HAMMERING ] [ SIGH ] . OK . This cabin is now hermetically sealed . You guys sure ? If anyone can keep Mittface out , I can . I know my slasher history . " Halloween , " came right through the window . " Evil Dead Two , " the root cellar . " Night of the Living Dead , " crash , right through the front door . What 's with the TV ? WYATT : " Poltergeist . " Yup , we got ' em all . Uh , what about " Silent Night , Deadly Night " ? MITTFACE : [ GROANING ] Oh , no . [ SCREAMS ] [ SCREAMING ] [ GRUNTS ] Wow . Not bad . Not bad at all . Girls , I think we 're ready for our erotic massages now . No way . We 're self-actualized and independent , right , Lisa ? Right , Brittany . I 'm Tiffany . Oh , no . You 're right . Lisa taught us about female pride . We 're better than all of this . So we 're going to go out and find ourselves some cute lawyers . Bye . [ GIGGLING ] WYATT : Thanks a lot . Don 't mention it . [ MOANING ] [ STATIC ] Hey , do you guys hear that ? It sounds like it 's coming in from outside . What is that stuff ? Video static . We 're being taped over . Taped over ? Somebody must have hit record on the VCR . But we 're not in any danger , are we ? Oh , no . Not unless the static touches us . Then we 'll be wiped out forever . [ SCREAMING ] Great . So we 're going to die because Chett had to tape " Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling " or something . We 're not going to die . Lisa will just zap us out of here . Right , Lis ? Then she 'll zap the VCR out of Record mode . Right ? What are you , on strike or something ? As long as I 'm a character in this movie , I don 't have any magic . We 're stuck in here until the movie ends . But we already killed Mittface ! That should end the movie ! Why aren 't we zapping out ? Guys ? What happened to Mittface ? I can 't believe I forgot . Rule number one . The killer never dies the first time around . I 'm such a Barnie . We gotta find Mittface before we get erased . Lotsa luck . You don 't find Mittface . He finds you . And we don 't have a lot of time . I know . We 'll have sex . Don 't you ever give up ? No means no . No , wait , wait , wait . I think I see what he 's going for . Characters with active sex drives are machete magnets , right ? Think of it as bait . All we have to do is make out , and Mittface will be in here to kill us before you know it . Congratulations , a pick up line I haven 't heard . So what do you say ? I think it 's a great idea . [ DOOR OPENING ] I 'll hide behind the door , knock his brains out before he has time to interrupt you two . Huh ? Uh , but I don 't think we 'd work as bait . It 's got to be a boy-girl thing . Oh . OK . You 're on brain detail . How come Wyatt gets to be the bait ? Do you really want the answer to that ? Maybe it 's because I 'm a gentleman . [ SCOFFS ] [ GRUNTS ] Fine . Suck face already . We 've got a slasher to whack . Slow down there , Wyatt . You 'll chip a tooth . That 's good acting , guys . Really looks like you 're having fun . Lis , if he 's bothering you , grunt twice . So where is that damn slasher ? What 's the matter ? I almost had it unhooked . Billy , this is wrong . Wrong ? When I first met you in that club , I thought we 'd share nothing more than a night of hot , cheap , acrobatic lust . And that would have been fine . Would have ? Oh , don 't you see , soldier boy ? You 've made me fall in love with you . I can 't stay here tonight knowing I may never see you again . But I- - If only you had been like the other guys I date , unemployed slugs leeching off their parents , we would have had the best sex ever . [ SQUEAKING NOISE ] It 's no use . I 've got to leave . And Billy , don 't be a hero . [ CRYING ] [ DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING ] MITTFACE : [ SCREAMS ] LISA : Let 's get out of here . It 's too close . We 're stuck . We 're dead ! I can 't believe you dropped it . We were doing our part ! Don 't remind me , tongue boy ! [ SCREAMS ] LISA : [ SCREAMS ] Would you look at that ? He 's stuck . He can 't reach us ! Yeah , but that can ! That 's it . He 's gone for good . The movie 's over . So when do we zap out of here ? Are you sure you 're not forgetting another rule or something ? - No . Mittface is gone . We played this one by the numbers . The movie 's over . There 's nothing left . Except the stupid credits . Maybe they 'll be real short . [ SCREAMING ] Huh ? Where are we ? I 'm not sure . I guess we got dumped into whatever show is taking over the slasher flick . Could you be a little more specific ? Look at my outfit . Do you see room for a " TV Guide " ? Uh , Gar . I just remembered what 's on cable tonight . [ LOUD THUMPING ] Rule number one . Their vision is based on motion . [ DINOSAUR SHRIEKING ] [ MUSIC - OINGO BOINGO , " WEIRD SCIENCE " ] THEME SONG : Weird science . Fantasy and microchips , shooting from the hip , something different , we 're making weird science . Ooo ! Pictures from a magazine , bits and pieces , bits and pieces . My creation , is it real ? It 's my creation ! I do not know . It 's my creation ! From my heart and from my hand , why don 't people understand my intentions ? [ MUSIC PLAYING ] [ MUSIC PLAYING ]

 [ sighing ] Thanks , Steve . I had a wonderful time . Well , the night is still young . - Come in for a nightcap ? - Okay . - Cool pad ! - Thanks , doll . It comes with all the extras . [ gasping ] [ gasping ] [ jazzy music playing ] - Highball ? - Well ... maybe just a teeny one . Okay . You know , I 'm really glad we got a chance to meet each other . I don 't usually do the whole dating thing but when you came up to me in the Java Man , it was like you knew me . I mean , I did go there often . [ purring ] Groovin ' and movin ' . Neat lava lamps . No ! Don 't touch those ! Uh ... Sorry , sugar . Those belong ... to my mother . To the hippest chick I know . And I know chicks . [ glasses shatter ] Dance ? [ ' 60s doo-wop ballad plays ] - I 've never met a cat like you , Steve . - [ gulps ] I think you may be the one . Dig it ! [ shuddering ] Steve ? - Are you okay ? - Yeah , baby . Let 's groove ! Steve ? What 's going on ? Steve ? Steve ? The mission has failed , Steve . Who are you ? What have you done with Steve ? You ? I remember you . You 're the aliens that kidnapped me . We 've traveled through many galaxies and seen many candidates , but you , Lisa , you are the one we 've chosen to be our new queen ! Huh ? Our race is dying out . We need a female to reproduce with . [ gulps ] Look , get it through your lumpy butt-heads " no " means no ! I 'm not interested in being your queen ! Now , what did you do with my date ? Well , uh , actually ... [ chuckles ] - Steve was one of us . - What ? [ slurping ] By carefully analying your popular culture we were able to create the perfect date . Dig it . A male of the species so sexually desirable no female could resist him . Let 's do the monkey till our cheeks sing . Unfortunately , he was unable to to withstand the sheer erotic power of your genie mating overtures . [ growling ] Unit seven , return to the vat . The vat ? I can dig it . Catch you later , baby . - I 'm out of here . - Oh , no ! Please don 't . We realize we came on too strong last time but give us another chance ! Here ... Think of the children ! They need a mother . - Are those your alien embryos ? - Coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie . Do they come ripping out of your stomach when they 're born ? - Well , uh ... a little . - I got to go . No , wait ! No , wait ! Don 't . Um ... we could be friends . Go to the mall ... uh ... talk on the phone , you know ? - Do stuff ? - Well ... Thanks . So ... - [ chuckling ] - We can give you a call ? Why don 't I call you ? [ aliens groaning ] [ moaning ] [ groaning ] What 's happened ? ! [ groaning ] Lisa ! What 's going on ? ! [ Wyatt whimpering ] ALIEN LEADER : Easy does it . Ow ! Whoops ! - Let me do it . - No . Let me . Back off ! I 've got it . WYATT : Lisa ! Whoops ! [ screaming ] What 's going on ? Lisa , hey ... we just , uh ... Dropped in to see what you were up to . It 's 3 : 00 in the morning ! - What are you doing here ? - Okay , you got us . We were going to abduct his brain and send him to the Organ Farms of Talos IV so you could spend some more free time with us . - Really ? - Mm-hmm . That 's kind of sweet . Lisa ! [ sighing ] I knew this wouldn 't work out . I can 't see you guys anymore . But I-I thought we were going ot be friends . Friends don 't send their friend 's friends to Alien Organ Farms , pal ! Steve , it 's over . Go . Okay . We 'll go . But this isn 't over yet . You still destined to be queen . Resistance is futile , baby . You will be assimilated . [ chuckling ] Enough is enough ! - I 've got ot red rid of these jerks . - Ow . Yeah . These guys don 't seem like they 're going to take " no " for an answer . There 's only one man I know who can deal with extraterrestrials . I 've been waiting my whole life for somone like you ; evidence that the paranormal does exist . Of course , you realize I have to erase your memory . What a shame . Nothing to remember you by . Except this . I know he can help . I 've got to find him . Uh ... hello ? Agent Scolder ? Scolder is no more . I am Bagwa Ramaan Rashneesh . O ... kay . Are those hot coals ? How come you 're not getting burned ? As long as I maintain my concentration pain has no meaning for me . By focusing inward , I am able to seek the truth without the distractions of the physical world . So the truth is in there ? You ... W ... w-whoa ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! [ panting ] I couldn 't let anyone know I was magic genie so I wiped your brain . I knew it . I tried everything to tap those respressed memories : hypnotic regression , mind-altering fungi repeated blows to the head with a javanese painstick . But now I see what I tried so hard to remember . Oh ... - Well , anyway- - - I need your help . I 'm having trouble with extraterrestrials . Extraterrestrials ? You mean you 've made contact ? You 've actually made contact ? Contact ? They 've been all over me . Well , what did they look like ? Gray skin ? Large heads ? Black , almond-shaped eyes ? Not exactly . They ... The deep lacerations across the chest indicate a sharp multi-pronged weapon- - possibly a garden weasel . [ phone rings ] Molly . It 's me . Scolder , where have you been ? Dredging up some old memories . Still chasing aliens , Scolder ? You need a hobby . I 'll try collecting beer cans . - That 's a joke , Molly . - Ah . I found what you 've been looking for : - proof . - Let me see it . - Then I 'll show it to you . - Then I 'll believe it . - Okay . - Fine . Good . How did your hair grow back so fast ? - A trick the monks taught . - Excuse me . You do- - Do I know you ? Although there 's no point in me telling you since you wouldn 't believe me anyway . So , your aliens live in Casa Mermuda ? You guys have to help me get rid of them . Get rid of them ? Since I was eight and my terrier , Mr. Yaps , was abducted I 've dedicated my life to the search for cosmic truths . Believe me , the only cosmic truth these guys know is how to stuff a wild bikini . I 'm out of here . Incredible . After all my years of searching , questing , seeking the truth here I am , face-to-face with a superior alien intelligence . - Is that a wonderbra ? - Scolder , this is absurd . Even you can 't be fooled by these ludicrous Halloween costumes . Find the zipper , babe . Molly , how can you still not believe when the proof is sitting right here in front of you ? Maybe because the proof is trying to see down my blouse . Ow ! You 've kissed Lisa , right ? Did you get any tongue ? [ panting ] At least tell me this- - Do you plan to colonize our world ? - You know it , baby ! - [ chuckling mischievously ] You were right , those guys are jerks . - Told you . - I can 't believe I 've dedicated my life to the search for extraterrestrial horndogs . So how do we get rid of them ? Well , I have an idea . It 's a bit unorthodox , but , uh ... Spill it , G-Man . All right , if I were to pose as your , uh , boyfriend the Steves might see that you were spoken for and back off . It would simply be a ruse , of course until the aliens got the message and left . Of course . Do you think we can pull it off ? Well , I did work undercover in a cult of hermaphrodite telemarketers for six months without beindetected . Another little trick the monks taught me . # How lucky can one guy be ? # # I kissed her , and she kissed me # # Like the fella once said # # Ain 't that a kick it the head ? # # The room was completely black # # I hugged her , and she hugged me back # # Like the sailor said , quote # # " Ain 't that a hole in the boat " # # My head keeps spinnin ' # # I go to sleep and keep grinnin ' # # If this is just the beginnin ' # # My life is gonna be bea-utiful # # I 've sunshine enough to spread # # It 's just like the fella said # # Tell me quick # # Ain 't it a kick # # In the head . # Oh , Steve , she took the human to our special place . That 's it ! I 've had it ! This tiny-brained interloper must be destroyed . MAN : I couldn 't agree more . Who are you ? A friend . Like you , I find Agent Scolder to be an unusually persistent irritant to my agenda . It would bring me great pleasure to see him terminated . You and us , buddy . We 'd love to take a whack at Mr. Suave-O . I have the solution that should satisfy us both . [ chuckles nervously ] : Uh , Lisa . Hardly . Yikes , it 's a T-5000 . One of the deadliest shape-shifting assassins in the galaxy . Call me Todd . Well . Looks like your plan worked . I haven 't seen those pink-headed buttinskis for days . Well , we can 't be absolutely sure that they won 't come back . It 's true . Maybe you should stick around ... ... a little longer . - Just a case . - Well , yeah . [ cell phone rings ] This better be good . MOLLY : I found something you should see . Meet me at the aliens ' apartment right away . - SCOLDER : I 'm busy right now . - You 're with her , aren 't you ? Molly ... you 're not jealous , are you ? Hardly . Still , I am a woman . As such , I 'm aware of weaknesses concerning mysterious blondes . Now put your hormones on ice and get over here . - What is it ? - I 've got to go . Molly 's found something at the aliens ' apartment . Later on , I 'm going to check out some unexplained cattle mutilations . - If you want to tag along ... - It 's a date . [ exhales deeply ] Molly ? Anybody here ? [ woman clears throat ] Hello , Scolder . Molly , what 's going me ? You said you had something to show me ? I do . [ beeps ] [ sighs ] Nice outfit . J. Edgar Hoover collection ? Come on , Scolder . Let 's get nasty . And then I floated right out of my bed . Explain that . Spontaneous noctural levitation . Perfectly normal for a boy your age . So , Lis ... Where 's your new boyfriend ? Agent Scolder isn 't my boyfriend . Wait a second . I thought he was with you . I 've been observing the freak brothers all afternoon . You didn 't ask Scolder to meet you at the Steves ' place ? - No . - We 've got to warn Scolder ! Come on , Scolder . Something besides aliens must smoke your bacon . I 'm not sure I 'm entirely comfortable discussing my bacon with you , Molly . What do you say we ... jump on the griddle ? Careful . You 'll bruise the gin . [ grunts ] Looking for this ? [ clicks ] Looking for these ? Yike . Oops . Whup his two-cheeked butt ! [ laughs ] [ grunting ] Look out for little Stevie ! - Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa ! - Oh , geez ! Whoa ... ! Ah ... ! - Oh , my God ! - [ frantic grunting ] This explains a lot . Step aside , Tex . Oh ... Head rush . Huh ! Ow ! - STEVE : Oh , nice leg action ... - Huh ? You ... are ... under ... arrest . Yeah ! Oh ... - Are you all right ? - I am now . Thank God . Nice work . - Are you okay ? - Fine . Despite this murderous alien 's shape-shifting ability - I knew it wasn 't the real Molly . - How ? He was too feminine . Oh , yeah , the alluring lingerie . Seductive bedroom eyes . The convincing pillow talk . I was far too aroused for it to have been Molly . Okay , that 's it ! For years , I followed you on your wild goose chases ! Yow know what ? ! You know what , Scolder ? ! - It 's all crap ! - What are you talking about ? All those long lonely stakeouts ... The smell of stale coffee and microwave burritos on your breath . I wanted you , Scolder ... bad . But you never gave me a second glance . I 'm a woman , damn it ! Are you ever . Say , have you ever considered a career change ? - Like being a queen , for instance ? - Yeah , a queen . - MOLLY : You 're on . - Yes ! Sorry , Lisa , but there 's something about a gal who can punch out a T-5000 and still smell as fresh as the Brine Pools of Meepus-5 . [ sniffing ] Let 's go , hot stuff . So , uh ... Still up for checking out those cattle mutilations ? I 've packed a cheeky little bordeaux . You know , Molly may smell like the Brine Pools of Meepus-5 ... But I 'll take a girl who knows what wine goes with cattle mutilations any day . Shall we ? # I thought love was only true in the fairy tales # - # And for someone else ... # - Go , baby , go ! # ... but not for me # # Her love was out to get me # # Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo # # That 's the way it seemed # # Disappointment haunted all my dreams ... # Captioned by Grant Brown

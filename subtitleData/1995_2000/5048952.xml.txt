 Oh . Oh , that 's it . Oh . Lower . A little lower . Now a little to the right . Oh . It 's a crying shame we 're gonna have to leave this place . No Kromaggs , no bad cops . A world where good tans and massages are compulsory . Thank you . All right , this is really just an inversion of the Lorentz transformation . You see , X prime equals X minus UT . I still can 't quite grasp the geometry of space-time . Be patient , bro . You gotta give yourself space and time . Okay , what do you say you geniuses take a little break and get the kinks out , huh ? I think you 're loose enough for the rest of us . Two minutes and thirty , people . Everybody out of the pool . Oh , no . Oh , man ! So what do you think it 's gonna be this time ? Polar ice world ? Talking dog world ? For once , people , I can tell you . We are going home . What ? You 're kidding . I thought you said the data from the micro-dots your parents gave you was all scrambled . You see , I thought Colin 's micro-dot was damaged . Turns out it was designed that way to keep other folks from accessing the coordinates . Other folks ? You mean the Kromaggs . Yeah . But I found a hidden de-encryption program keyed to our specific DNA . There she is . I tell you , finding out how they beat the Maggs is gonna be worth the whole price of admission . Home to see the parents , huh ? Our parents . You like the sound of that , bro ? Yes . Well , then , you have the honors . Oh , God . This isn 't quite what I expected . Hello ! Hey ! Where 's the welcome wagon ? Yeah , let 's just find the exit . The air 's got a metallic taste , like it 's processed . That still doesn 't tell us where we are . I think we 're a long way from home . What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? Are you sure you got the coordinates right ? Positive . Yeah , well , something must 've gone haywire . It looks like something out of Star Trek . The lost episodes . Look , the timer takes us to alternate Earths , not alien planets . Yeah , well , it looks pretty barren out there . I mean , if this is your home world , where are all the people ? I do not know , all right ? Why does everybody always expect me to have all the answers ? Because you usually do . So if this is home sweet home , we stick around , if not , we slide out . How long do we have on the universal remote ? Oh , brother . We got a problem . The timer 's not counting down . What 's wrong with it ? You don 't know . Yes , that 's right . I don 't know . Excuse me . Over here , please . This way . There 's nothing to be afraid of . Colin , it 's our ... Father . I know this may be disorienting for some of you , as you were no doubt trying to get to my world . But instead , you 've been shunted here by the slidecage mechanism . Slidecage ? You see , following the recent human-Kromagg war , we have driven the enemy from our world and cloaked it so that they may not return by the same means . And we therefore cannot return you , as that would pose a security risk . If you are a friend rather than an enemy , I am truly sorry . All your needs will be provided for , food and air and shelter . You must not tamper with the dispensing machines . If you attempt to venture outside , the toxic atmosphere will kill you . Aside from these two strictures , you 're free to live by the rules that you create . Please , make the best of this world . It is now your world , for the rest of your lives . For the rest of our lives ? It 's a perfect protection system . Keep the Kromaggs from invading . Try and slide there , and you get caught here instead . They must have some sort of dampening field to render this inoperable . Wait a minute . You 're saying that we 've wandered into some kind of roach motel for sliders ? But why would our parents cloak their world and not come get us ? They didn 't know . I was hidden from them , and you were lost , your foster parents dead . That 's just great . We 're not even in this war and we 're POWs . No . No , there 's gotta be a way out of this . Right , Quinn ? There 's always a way out . Okay , okay . We 'll do what we always do , beat the odds . Okay ? Come on . Yeah . Yeah , fine . Do you guys hear that ? All right . We need to see what the rules are first . Okay , now we know . No , come back ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Remmy ! Hey ! Wait for us ! Well , what the hell were they ? They were Kromaggs . Let 's go follow the humans . What makes you think the humans will help us ? I don 't know , but at least they 're human . Hey . Hey ! Hey , hold it ! Hey ! We 're friends ! We 're friends ! Friends ? I know my friends . You , I don 't know . Hold it , Luther . Let them go . Well , no reason to start off on the wrong foot . We 're all humans , after all . Now , we don 't have many rules here , but the ones that we do have you 're going to have to live by I 'm sorry . To survive . If you heard about that little fight , then you must have heard that one of our friends got captured . He 's gone , or will be before the night 's out . You 're going to have to forget him . Well , we 're not about to do that . I understand your feelings , but you don 't know where you are . We are all that 's left of over 200 . We were all away from the home world during the war . Some didn 't hear about the cage being built , some took too long to get back . Whatever the reason , we 're here . We keep on the run so the Kromaggs can 't find us . Won 't you help us ? Believe me , I 'm trying to . Okay , now , my brother and I are from the home world . But we really don 't remember it , because during the war our parents put us on other worlds . And we don 't want to make them ... Save your breath , Quinn . Look , I may be new here , but I 've seen enough bad cos in my day to recognize the breed . And you , someone who 's helped you has just been hung out to dry , how does that make you feel ? Maybe she has a point , Janie . Maybe we should ... Out . Now ! All right . Airlock . What the hell 's an airlock ? We 'll do what you say ! Quinn ! Don 't do this ! She 's got a temper ! Vent it . Wait ! No ! Let him go ! Maggie ! Maggie ! Lock him down . Computer room . I 'm not leaving my brother ! We 're not going to hurt your brother . Come on . Come on , now . That 's it . Maggie ? She 's probably dead by now . Don 't give me that . You murdered her . She wouldn 't have made it here , and she would have taken some of us with her . You don 't even know her . Turn that hate where it belongs , on the Kromaggs . The Kromaggs ? The Kromaggs ? I hope you burn in hell . This is hell , or didn 't you notice ? The mainframe that runs this place is sealed up tight . We can 't get into it . We can 't do a damn thing . And most of all , we can 't leave . No one takes prisoners here . We get a Magg , we open him up , we leave him for the others . I do what I do to keep these people alive . Lock him up with his brother . Let go of me , man ! Let go ! I can walk ! You humans are so loud , even when you 're not in pain . I haven 't seen you . Well , I wish I could say the same , but everywhere I go , there you maggots are . Is he alone ? No , I had my group with me . Group ? Yeah , you know . Bass , drums , keyboards . I couldn 't bring my back-up singers on this tour , though . The Brownettes . You 're gonna have to go the limit with me . I 've already spent time in Kromagg hell . What about your companions ? The rest of the humans ? Where do they camp now ? Do you know the difference between a human brain and a Kromagg brain ? A human brain is blood and tissue . A Kromagg brain is a knife . Your friends . A woman , two men . Something special about the men . Especially one of them . You 're sure he 's going to find a way out of here . Something else there , hidden , buried , deep . A secret . A Kromagg secret ! What ? Open to me ! Is he dead , Father ? No , merely unconscious . There 's a wall in his mind , but I will break it . I must rest now . Chain him . Do you remember I told you about the snake in the garden and how the humans despised it and tried to kill it ? They hate anything that is not like them . You 're not to speak with him . Do you understand me ? I can see why this is a perfect prison for us . I can 't get any of this stuff to work . Beat the odds , right ? That 's what I told her . Just like always , Quinn . On my world , we know death well . Many families lost a parent , a child , or both . The influenza carried off my foster mother and father . At first , I didn 't want to live . Why did it take them and not me ? I read somewhere that death is a natural part of life . You can 't change it , you can 't avoid it . All you can do is remember those you 've lost and live for the ones that are still here . Okay . Okay , man . I 'll see if we can get some of this crap to work . Okay , it 's all right , you 're not dead ! I mean , it would be a pretty sorry afterlife if it looked like this . Where am I ? In the walls . You 're confused . It 's only natural , after what you 've been through . Pitching you out in the methane , honestly , I don 't know what they were thinking . Thomas . Thomas Beecham . Maggie Beckett . Maggie ? I would 've figured you for a Betty , or maybe a Lola , when I saw you in the corridor with your friends . Where are my friends ? Easy . Easy , easy . Take it easy . You 're not up to anything yet . That 's it . Just relax . You 're a guest . Matter of fact , you 're the first . I 'm a bit of a stay-at-home , but when I saw what was happening to you , I ... Well , what 's done is done . You rest now . Thank you . I 'm not allowed to talk to you . Everyone 's out foraging , you know . Except for the guards , and they 're not even watching us . You wouldn 't happen to have keys to these locks on you , would you ? Yeah , I didn 't think so . You know , I 've never been this close to a human being before . I mean , not a whole one . Enjoy the show . Oh , man , my head . It 's killing me . Oh , I can fix that . I mean , I can go inside your mind . It took me a long time ... You stay out of my head ! Well , I can , you know . I had enough of that today . My father taught me . Why do you wear that thing across your face like that ? Because I 'm a mutation . I 'm hideous . We don 't have any looking glasses , but my father told me . Yeah , that 's nice of him . Oh , man ! When my mother dressed me for kindergarten , I never thought I 'd end up here . Tell me about your mother . Why ? Because I never had a mother . So where do I start ? At the beginning . Made it myself , so I could explore outside . Good thing , too , or I wouldn 't have been able to get to you . You 're looking worlds better . I 'm still a little unsteady on my pins . Oh , naturally . To be expected . Hey , presto ! I cooked something . Actually , it comes out of a hole in the wall , so it 's more accurate to say I extruded it . I didn 't know what you 'd like , so I ordered up a choice . Artificial ham , artificial turkey . Actually , it all tastes like artificial chicken . But it does grow on you . So , how did you land here ? I assume you were off-world . I was traveling with my friends . It 's a little complicated . Well , complicated is good . It makes for a long story . And time we have in abundance . So what about you ? How did you end up here ? Oh , various and sundry this and thats . Not really important . How long have you been here ? In the walls ? Oh , not long . Ten years . Ten years ? Well , it 's not as bad as it sounds . Really . I always loved tunnels and corridors . Remember that TV show , Beauty and the Beast , not the Disney one , the other one ? God , I loved that . Oh , I see you noticed my home entertainment center . I set this up to keep an eye on things . I must say , the designers built this place with room to spare . 73 disparate levels , 2,300 tunnels . It 's a wonder a soul ever finds anyone . The Kromaggs hunker down here , while the humans are fairly nomadic . They 're making their digs in this vicinity nowadays . Yes , sir , lots of elbow room . Generally , from eight to twelve I watch the humans , from twelve to four the Kromaggs . It 's quite diverting . I have my favorite characters . We could use these to find my friends . Well , yes , theoretically . But I wouldn 't recommend it . Some of the things you might see ... You 're not up to much excitement yet . Thomas , it matters . Please . Okay , it 's just as I hoped . The same de-encryption string our father hid in the micro-dots he planted here . He surmised we might come this way . And he gave us a key . Can we turn off the Slidecage mechanism ? Not from here . It 's on a separate grid . So first , we 've got to find a way out . Okay , there 's a venting duct that comes in here . Over there . All right , I can override this locking code . Only hitch is that there 's a stretch of it that 's open to the outside atmosphere . How long of a stretch ? Just a few hundred feet . We 'll hold our breath . I can 't make it . Hold on , hold on . We 're almost there . Come on ! I feel like I 've just been through the longest car exhaust in the world . Let 's go find Remmy . Freaking Kromaggs . Get away from me . It hurts ! You are not speaking of us . They did something to you in the camps . Implanted something in your mind . You are to kill someone . Who ? Why ? Twenty minutes , and then wake him and we start again . I will have this . You know , you 're gonna get eyestrain that way . Here . I made it myself . Shh . I 'm a positive fiend at checkers . Please . Oh . How about a good book ? I had it in my back pocket when I arrived . Or I could recite it for you . There they are . Do you recognize it ? Do you know where it is , Thomas ? Well , I ... It 's ... Thomas ? It 's a corridor nearby . Show me the way . No , that 's not such a good idea , really . What are you talking about ? It would be much better if we just stayed here . Safer , trust me . They 're my friends . I have to go find them . Really bad things happen out there ! You only had a taste . This is a controlled environment . No one knows about it , no one comes here . We can live out our lives . No . No . Thomas , I appreciate your kindness , but I have no intention of staying here . Now , I 'm going to my friends , whether you come with me or not . I 'd rather you come with me . No , no , no , no . No , no , that 's out ! I don 't talk to people ! You talked to me . You were different . So many have died here . I couldn 't let you be another one . Want to know why I 'm here , in the walls ? During the war , I was assigned off-world . Eighth Armored Division . It got so bad . I cracked . Ran off . When I came back , they were all dead . All my friends . Nothing but blood and meat . I lost it . Wandered for months , years . Finally , I wanted to come home , but it was too late . So I landed here . It only seems right . I should have been with them . Thomas , you couldn 't save your friends . But you can save mine . Please . The Kromaggs took Remmy right through there . I 've still got this funny feeling that Maggie 's looking down on us . At the end of our road , they say that you are reunited ... Shh . Quinn ! Maggie ! There they are ! Come on ! In here ! Maggie ... Get in , quick ! Hey , let go of him ! Get off of me ! We 're human ! Thomas , I 'm so sorry . If you had brought the Kromaggs down on us , I 'd have chased you to hell and gone and killed you all . Yeah , well , we 're not so easy to kill . Nobody 's gonna kill anybody . That 's not up to you . Now , listen to me . We 've got something you need . Aren 't you a little curious about how we got out of that room ? Where 's the mechanism that runs the Slidecage ? In Kromagg territory . I was hoping you 'd say that . My head feels like a butcher 's gone to work . There 's not gonna be much left if he keeps it up . Quickly , while no one 's looking . Go ! Why don 't you come with me ? No , I can 't , because the humans will kill me . My father told me so , all right ? Go , go . All right . But there 's something I 'm gonna have to do first . No , no ! Oh , no ! My God . No ! I told you I was hideous ! I 'm hideous ! My God , you are not hideous . You 're beautiful . You are human . You understand ? You 're human . Come on . Come on . Trust me . Kaldeen , no ! Stop them ! Go ahead . Go , go , go ! Stop ! Kill him . Come on , come on ! Kaldeen , cover yourself . I will think how to deal with you . Take him to his room . How could you do it ? He 's your own son . Wait a minute , you got him in some kind of raid , didn 't you ? My own son was killed , and there was no hope of having another . Something about this place prevents it . So I took this one . Everyone is a bit mad here . Some more than a bit . And no one ever told him he was human . They were forbidden . Enough of this ! I will have your secret now , and then you die . Who are you to kill ? Who did they order you to kill ? Tell me . Tell me . Quinn . Quinn . Why would they want you to kill your friend ? He 's got the key to the Slidecage . Go with him to find it . Soon as he can open it , kill Quinn before he can close it . Rest . Remember none of this . What happened ? Quinn ! Do you mind ? I 'd like to keep my hair . I got to missing those loud shirts of yours . How you holding ? Tortured , beat up and starved . Same old same old . Are you a comrade of this one ? A recent arrival ? My name is Quinn Mallory . My father built this prison . Go on . I think I can unlock the Slidecage , but the equipment is in your territory . So I 'm suggesting a truce , and we might all get out of here . To the home world ? I can 't say that . An alternate Earth , perhaps . But I won 't know until I get to the guts of the machine . What do you want ? Safe passage . For him , too . Agreed . If you can do what you say . The kid comes , too , or all bets are off . What 's taking him so long ? We should never have let him go alone . I 've been watching the Kromagg show for many seasons . Believe me , it 's the only thing that had a chance of working . There something you want to say ? It 's a puzzle to me . You seem to have a good heart . You care about your people . Yet you commit such cruelties . You can 't lead with your heart . I 've only seen a few worlds , but I can 't believe that 's true . Time to move out . He 's probably dead now anyway . That 's one of your favorite words , isn 't it ? Quinn and Remmy ! Oh , my God ! Remmy ! Didn 't think you 'd get rid of this face , now , did you ? Oh , thank God ! How the crops hanging , farm boy ? Crops don 't hang , Rembrandt . Stay as sweet as you are , huh ? I thought you 'd had it . We keep thinking that about each other , don 't we ? Well , you keep coming back . Easy now , easy now , easy now . We 're all friends . Easy , easy . We 're all friends . It 's all good , it 's all good . Well , at least we share a common interest . You don 't need the mask . He 's been away at a Kromagg prison for about 16 years . Does he look familiar ? You 're Jules Konig . My mother and father ? Dead . I 'm sorry . I will show you the Slidecage . Come . I need to talk to you . What is it ? We can 't let Kromaggs back on the home world . They 'll be under guard . And as soon as they get there , they 'll be sent back to wherever they came from . Or maybe when we slide out of here , they don 't . Safe passage goes both ways . And once they take us where we 're going , you 're going to have to leave your war behind . Better hurry up to the Slidecage . You don 't want to get left behind . You will need this . Careful ! The force field will kill all who near it . Not anymore . You 've gotta learn to trust me a little more . Got the Sharks and the Jets here . Better get a move on . People , welcome to the Slidecage . There . Blue skies , green trees . Won 't be long now , buddy . It 's rather close in here , don 't you think ? So many bodies . You just keep telling yourself you 'll be back with friends and family . Actually , that was never my strong suit . Thanksgivings were a horror . The Slidecage mechanism is disabled and wide open . Do you think maybe I could go with you guys ? Because I don 't really want to go with the Kromaggs . The system is damaged . If I slide everyone to the home world , it 'll stay open . Rembrandt . The Kromaggs could just slide in and invade . Then there 's no going home . Sorry , bro . Not this time . Quinn ! Incredible . Grab him ! I can 't hold him long ! Remmy ? What did you do to him ? It was the Kromagg prison camp . Kaldeen ! My name is Jules . Remmy ! If it 's near the surface , I can reach it . Sure you ... Hold it ! Hold it ! Hey ! You Kromaggs have crossed the line for the last time ! Hold it ! Now , the truce is still on . And nobody 's going anywhere ! Okay ? Rembrandt , what happened to you , let it go . You owe it no allegiance . Let it go . Rembrandt , let it go . Remmy . Okay , it 's gone . What did I miss ? Absolutely nothing . Oh . Come on . What did I do , slip ? All right , using the slide signatures in our bodies , I 've managed to rig up a feedback burst . It 'll ship all of us to where we just came from , and anyone else who ever tries to slide to the home world . So no more Slidecage . Yep . And the Kromaggs 'll still be kept out . Hold on , Q-Ball . What about Jules ? He 's from here . He has no slide signature . Well , I can 't change the parameters on this . The whole system 'll crash . It 's okay . No way . It 's not okay . What are you saying ? We just maroon him here ? Look , we 're not leaving you here alone . I 've always been alone , Rembrandt . Is there any way you could let me out of this party ? You want to stay ? I 'm really not up to Times Square . You mind a roommate , kid ? No . Well , then you fellas better grab a seat on the ramp . Because this is a pretty narrow field . Take care . You , too . We 're coming back for you . That 's a promise . All right . Anybody who wants a ride ... Kromaggs on the right side of the cage , humans on the left . Goodbye , Father . Goodbye , Jules . Son . All right , everybody . Bon voyage . So , you ever played checkers ? Blue skies , green trees . Thank you . We 're not home yet . But there 's places a whole lot worse . We 'll get there , bro . You can count on it . I wonder where everyone else went . Well , wherever they are , I can 't imagine peace between the humans and the Kromaggs lasting for very long . I was programmed to kill you , Q-Ball . Something I 'll never get over . It wasn 't you who tried to kill my brother . It was the Kromaggs . Gotta admit , though , it was the perfect plan . Not so perfect . They didn 't count on you making a friend who 'd stop it . The Maggs could get in your head , Remmy , but they can 't get inside your heart . Yeah . To Jules . And Thomas . And absent friends .

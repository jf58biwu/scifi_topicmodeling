 [ Miss Parker ] People don 't just sit around a junkyard for a month . Mr. Woods said he was tired of being on the road and wanted some peace and quiet . He wanted to catch up on his reading . Like there was money in it . That man read night and day . Read ? Read what , exactly ? Books . Hundreds of 'em . Look at all these . Mr. Woods brought all of these with him ? Most were delivered when he bought out stock from the old library . All of these are about mathematics and science . - Same here . - Mr. Woods was a big science nut . Once , he spent 14 hours sitting in this rocking chair , flippin 'a half-dollar . Fourteen hours ? Weird , huh ? Said heads were better odds . Somethin 'about the suryace and the , uh , aerodynamics . Except for dimes . He said never bet with a dime . Didn 't say why . " Factoring Statistics . " " Physics and Random Probabilities . ' " Oh , I think I 'll wait for the movie on that epic . " Making Odds Even . ' " May I ? Jarod 's left a message . We 're close . We 're nowhere except whereJarod wants us . Why would a man want to learn so much ? Damn good question . - [ Bell Ringing ] - [ Dealer ] Blackjack . - The guy on table nine is killing us . - On my way . This guy 's gotta be a cheat . No , no . There 's no way he 's counting eight decks . - [ Dealer ] Another winner ! - [ Cheering , Applauding ] - How much is he up ? - Over a hundred grand , it 's gotta be . What ? The chief , Mr. Morgan , approved the increased credit limit . Who the hell is this guy ? [ Cheering , Applauding Continue ] Ivy , come here . - What 's he drinking ? - Dr. Pepper . Offer Cristal or Stoli . I tried that . He wants Dr. Pepper . [ Cheering , Applauding Continue ] Excuse me , please . Dr. Pepper . Heads . - Ten in a row . - [ Dealer ] All bets are down . Be my luck . Mister , I couldn 't even win the big half of a wishbone . Hi . I 'm Ivy . Mr. Felson . Hit me . House stands on 17 . Twenty-two . House wins . See ? I 'm a total jinx . You can only be a jinx if you believe in luck . - Do you believe in luck ? - No . - [ Dealer ] Blackjack . - All right ! Neither do I. - And another blackjack . - [ Cheering , Applauding Continue ] That 's it . I 'll deal with Mr. Morgan . Shut him down . So much for jinx . - Let it ride . - [ Cheering , Applauding ] [ Man Narrating ] [ Man ] lfhe 's counting cards , I can 't catch it . - You think this is a game ? - Well , this is Las Vegas . - Isn 't everything ? - [ Door Opens ] This is the guy , Mr. Morgan . Like to count cards , do you ? - Davis ? - His name is Jarod Felson . I ran his I. D ... cruise ships to Monte Carlo . Didn 't find a file on him anywhere . I 'm honored Mr. Felson has selected the Marquis Casino ... for his first scam . Who here thinks that makes Mr. Felson a complete idiot ? [ Jarod ] Maybe your security chief didn 't dig deep enough . Why don 't you try the F.B.I. file under RICO ? You run rackets ? [ Typing On Keyboard ] Hello , Mr. Morgan ! You set this up . You knew we 'd have this conversation . Not bad for a complete idiot . [ Davis ] Where are your blackjack winnings ? I had them delivered to Mr. Morgan 's office by a nice young lady named Ivy . - You 're giving me the money back ? - Money doesn 't interest me . If not money , what does interest you ? I 'm not here to make a fool of you , Mr. Morgan , or to rip you off . So , what do you want ? Excuse me ? You have an incredible security system , Mr. Morgan . It 's a shame no one here knows how to use it . [ Jarod ] The bet was $ 1,000 . What did the dealer pay out ? Purple chip . A grand . [ Jarod ] Meet Martin Rawlings . He 's been dealing blackjack here for 10 years . He 's the best we have . That 's too bad , because he 's about to lose his job . He used to work at a magic club in Kentucky . His specialty ? Sleight-of-hand . An extra thousand for the plant . He passes it to the courier . Gave the chip to the waitress . Where 's she going ? Forget the courier . Focus on the chip . Because it and dozens like it ... are on their way to your security chief 's mace holster . - Mr. Morgan ... - [ Morgan ] Remove it . I 've worked here for ten years . - All of a sudden some jerk in a shiny suit ... - Help him . That 's over $ 10,000 . Get him outta here . It 's not gonna stop here . - A casino ... it 's always a target . - [ Door Closes ] So , Mr. Felson ... what do you want ? Five percent of what you don 't lose while I 'm in charge . Don 't you little ladies forget ... come see my show tonight . There 's no cover , no minimum , and there 's free hot hors d 'oeuvres . - [ Ladies Giggling ] - I 'll see y 'all later . Bye-bye . Thank you very much . Hey there , teddy bear . You come to rub elbows with the king of rock and roll ? No . I 'm trying to understand this . You dress up in a rented costume and pretend to be a dead singer ? " Singer " ? Son , do you have any idea who I am ? - Well , actually , I would assu ... - You are looking at a national monument . Mount Rushmore in blue suede shoes . There 's not a human being on God 's green Earth ... that has ever demanded the attention and respect ... of the man you are lookin ' at this very moment . Hey , Bernie , some guy at the craps table says he 'll give you five bucks to goose his wife . I 'll be right there . Well , my fans beckon . I must go . Thank you very much . That is the last of them . I 've run every one of these through the mainframe ... and I can still find no correlation . Although there is something to be said forJarod 's theory ... on the aerodynamics of a 50-cent piece . Heads . Okay . Jarod is trying to tell me something ... and this book is the clue . That 's a hell of a clue , Syd . Jarod highlighted the entire book . But look at this page of statistics . He traced over all the number eights . Now , eight is Jarod 's favorite number . His favorite figure . He calls it upright infinity ... because of the way one loop coils into the next , never ending . Maybe your Boy Wonder has turned into Brian Boitano . Mm-mmm . Jarod is looking for a purpose . He 's playing games . Games ? Games with numbers ? High-stakes games ? High-stakes poker . Baccarat . Well , that narrows it down ... to any of the thousands of gaming establishments on the planet . Any ideas where to start ? I know just the man to see . Hello . Have you read this ? It 's ... It 's very good . It 's about this inquisitive little monkey named George . He was curious . I 've only read it about a thousand times . Oh , well , good . Then maybe you can help me . Who is the man in the yellow hat ? I don 't know . - Oh , well . Thank you anyway . - Okay ! Can I help you ? Jarod . It 's about time . - Hanlon 's been asking for you . - Asking for me ? Exposing Davis 's scam saved him more money than his creative accountant ever did . Steve Hanlon , Jarod Felson . It 's a pleasure to meet you , sir . I want to thank you for helping us out . Here at the Marquis , we think of ourselves as family . Nothing worse than being betrayed by those close to you . Truly impressive , the way you came in and cleaned house . I guess the only question I have ... is why ? Why would a man I never heard of , never laid eyes on ... step in to help my business out of the blue like that ? I 'm a fan , Mr. Hanlon . You took a no-name video store . You turned it into an empire . You listen to people . You give them what they want . I like that . You study people too . Master your space . My lecture at Brownstone . - That must have been 12 years ago . - It was 11 . And it was the first time you used " Family First " as the company motto . - You were there ? - No , sir . But I bought the cassette . I wore out my tape player . Peter , watch out . I might steal this man for corporate . [ Laughs ] Well , thank you , sir . We finally got corruption out of the Marquis . I would like to help keep it that way . Jarod , you have my permission to do whatever it takes . I thank you , sir . Jarod , this is my wife , Kitty . Kitty , Jarod Felson , our new security chief . - Nice to meet you . - A pleasure , Mr. Felson . I saw your picture in the lobby . Kitty used to headline the show here . Uh , I need to steal Mr. Hanlon for a moment . - Nice to meet you , Mr. Felson . - Nice to meet you . So , you 're a company man , huh ? I agree with Mr. Hanlon 's theories on family , if that 's what you mean . The only thing Hanlon likes about family is the procreating part . He spends millions building this playground ... and proclaims families now have a reason to vacation together . And you don 't think they do ? At a casino ? Jarod , people who never even dreamed of gambling now think it 's sanctioned by God . Add a few flashy arcades , even the damn kids go home broke . Don 't let Hanlon fool you . He may talk the new corporate attitude in this town ... deep down , he 's still old Vegas . [ Monitor Beeping ] I 'm sorry it took me so long to get here , Maggie . [ Beeping Continues ] [ Door Opens ] Visiting hours are over at 8 : 00 . [ Woman On P.A. ] Dr. Ryan to O.R. I thought she was all alone . Well ... she 's not alone anymore . No offense , uh ... She isn 't going to wake up . I know . But it doesn 't mean she can 't hear me . My name 's Jarod . Oh . Name 's Buddy . Nice to meet you . - Buddy . - Hmm ? If-lf anything happens to her , will you page me ? I didn 't mean to ... sound cold before , but ... I 've learned not to get too attached . But it is nice to know ... someone gives a damn . [ Door Closes ] [ Tires Screeching ] Miss Parker , what are we doing here ? Saying hello to an old friend . Hey , I know you 're excited to see me . Just keep it in your pants , Vito . Sydney , say hello toJohnny . Johnny 's brother hacked into the computer profiles ... at one of our satellite companies in Chicago . - Now he 's serving 10 hard in Joliet . - What do you want ? He 's working a con in a casino . This face ? He 's not a con . He 's not the type . He is every type . Find him for me . - Pass . - Mmm . Not an option . Because , you know , I heard that at 3 : 00 tomorrow ... you 're shipping out a boatload of ... [ Whispering ] stolen cars to Venezuela . Now if you don 't want the Port Authority all over your little boat , well ... - You wouldn 't . - Wanna bet ? Fifty thousand for information . No questions asked . - [ Applause ] - [ Sighs ] [ Emcee ] Thanks , ladies and gentlemen . You 've been a terrific audience tonight . Hey . If you 're not staying at our fabulous hotel , please drive safely . Well , welcome to the Heartbreak Hotel . What are you doing here ? You should be on stage . Oh , no . There 's no more stage for the King . The casino fired me . I 'm sorry . Did it have something to do with that bird thing ? - Bird thing ? - The ... goose . [ Snickers ] No . No , they said they had had complaints about the show . So I put on 20 , 30 pounds . You think it 's easy being the idol of millions ? - I would guess no . - You 're damn right it isn 't . I sacrificed everything . I did it ' cause I loved it . It 's what the people wanted . I just wish some of those casino bigwigs could spend one hour ... wearing the cape ... just one hour . They 'd walk away singing a different tune , I guaran-damn-tee you . Well , couldn 't you get a job at another casino ? No . No , buddy boy . After 24 years of making people smile ... singing the songs and ... spreading the good vibrations ... I 'm afraid it 's the end of the line for the King . No , we ... we had one hell of a ride though . Didn 't we ? I bet you did . Look , I ... I 'm sorry . I 'm spilling my guts , and I don 't even know your name . Jarod . Felson . Bernie Baxley . Well , it 's nice to meet you , Bernie Baxley . Thanks . Jarod ? I 'm scared . Of what ? Him . [ Phone Rings ] - Sydney . - Hello , Sydney . Jarod . Good to hear from you . It 's been a while . Where are you calling from ? You 'll figure that out sooner or later . - I 'm counting on later . - Counting on or betting on ? You are so well read . You know , it 's such a pleasure to have the freedom to read whatever I want these days . Why the games , Jarod ? It 's in the mail . Jarod ? [ Dial Tone ] [ Imitating Monkey Hooting ] [ Jarod ] I 'm having trouble understanding the account totals from July . Guy even works on his day off . You pay me to locate discrepancies ... and I can 't reconcile the figures against last year ... specificallyJuly . - Just set it aside . - Set it aside ? Jarod , there 's a reason those numbers don 't match . One of our showgirls was attacked in the parking garage . Our revenue dropped 30 % for three days . It was an anomaly . [ Morgan ] Not to mention a publicity nightmare . Fortunately , the megabuster jackpot hit two days later ... and everybody came back . Sometimes Lady Luck even smiles on the house . [ Hanlon Chuckling ] [ Ivy ] Thanks for the escort , Mr. Felson . None of us walk alone anymore . Not since Maggie . Maggie . She was the woman that was attacked . - Right . - You knew her ? Well , I 'd seen her in the show and around ... backstage , you know . I read in the paper there was no evidence of a robbery . No . The night it happened , the showroom was completely packed . It was the Fourth ofJuly . Maggie was so happy . She 'd just landed the lead in a big show in Atlantic City . Maggie was leaving town ? Yeah , I guess so . I know I would . God , it happened right here . - Gardenias . - Excuse me ? Uh , Maggie always wore a gardenia in her hair . I know it sounds strange , but ... every time I pass this spot , I swear I can smell gardenias . - Listen , thanks . - Sure . - Drive safe . - Thank you . [ Engine Starts ] [ Young Jarod ] This is weird , Sydney . This doesn 't make sense . I made it inside . She doesn 't hear me . The hallway 's dark . It smells like ... flowers . I round a corner . To where ? The kitchen . I 'm getting closer . I know they made her do things that she didn 't want to do . Did she do something wrong ? Keep going , Jarod . Now focus on the killer and not the victim . Is the woman on the bed her old self or her new self ? They are the same person . She doesn 't think so . [ Sydney ] You have what you need to complete the simulation . [ Young Jarod ] But I don 't know why he 's there . Is he trying to kill Norma Jean or Marilyn ? I 'm confused . [ Sydney ] Finish the simulation . [ Young Jarod ] Itjust seems so unfair . No one should have to die alone . Something 's wrong with this picture . Something 's wrong with this picture too , Sydney . Somebody 's luck just ran out . [ Bell Dings ] - Thanks for the escort , Mr. Felson . - It was my pleasure . Now , you 're absolutely sure that you don 't know who this man in the yellow hat was ? Sorry . - My car 's right here . - Well , have a good night . Thanks . This was just delivered . Come on , Sydney . We have a plane to catch . Packin ' up , huh ? Gotta stay mobile , son . You know , I was thinkin about heading ' back east . You know , try Branson . Vegas has changed , you know . Not much in a city like this for an old dog like me . Thanks . Oh , that ... is an official piece ... of Graceland memorabilia . - Well , it 's very nice . - [ Sighs ] Oh , kid , you know ... you should see the house in person . It 's , uh ... The King named it for his mama . People talk about how Elvis let himself go there near the end ... how he stopped caring about the people , about the music . To me , it was just the opposite . - The opposite ? - Yeah . He cared too much . He ran so fast ... so quick ... he didn 't have anything left to finish the race . Too bad I won 't be able to finish it for him . You never know , Bernie . Sometimes a change of scenery can do you good . Maybe . [ Pager Beeping ] [ Monitor Beeping ] It 's okay , Maggie . You 're not alone . [ Monitor : Sustained Tone ] [ Monitor Clicks Off ] So , where is he ? So , where is he ? It 's a hundred grand . - That was not the arrangement . - Actually , Sydney , it was . Your boy is in the Marquis Casino in Vegas . It 's always a pleasure taking white collar to the cleaners . [ Miss Parker Chuckles ] I know what you mean . I brought 200,000 with me . Who knew you 'd be such a cheap date ? Come on , Syd . We 're going to Las Vegas ... a place where maybe even you could get lucky . [ Line Rings ] [ Woman ] Hospital Administration . Can you hold , please ? [ Jarod ] Uh , yes , I 'll hold . Yes , I would like to arrange to pay Maggie Blaire 's hospital bills . They have ? Could you tell me by whom ? - Thank you . - [ Line Disconnects ] I thought you 'd come . I wanted to pay my respects . Just like you paid for Maggie 's hospital bills ... and for this funeral ? You found the videotape , didn 't you ? What ? The real security tape from the night of the attack . The one that Peter made sure the police never saw . It shows Maggie leaving the Marquis with your husband . - They were having an affair , weren 't they ? - Who are you ? Somebody who doesn 't believe that Maggie deserved her fate . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You don 't have to pretend like it 's not happening anymore . You don 't understand . He doesn 't mean to hurt me . Yes , he does . This is your husband 's rap sheet . You 're not the first person that he 's hurt . And unless he 's stopped , Maggie 's not gonna be the last person he kills . My God . Kitty ... I 'm here because I want to help you . I can stop him ... if you help me . No . No , I ... I can 't do that . When I told him that Maggie was dead and that I knew what had happened ... h-he lost it . He said he 'd kill me if I told anyone . And then he just hit me again ... and again ... [ Sobbing ] and again . Why did he stop ? The phone rang . Kitty , one day the phone 's not gonna ring . Mr. Hanlon . Jarod Felson . I 've discovered a serious problem ... and I 'd like to discuss it with you one-on-one . Say tomorrow morning , around 10 : 00 ? Ivy , it 's Mr. Felson . I was wondering if you could do me a favor . [ Speaking German ] - Hello ? - Peter . Jarod Felson . Jarod . What 's up ? I 've discovered an even larger problem than before . - Is it Davis again ? - No . But it 's big , something you need to handle ... personally . Can you meet me tomorrow morning , around 10 : 00 ? Absolutely . I 'll see you there . So , what are you , about a 38 ? - What ? - Waist . Uh , 30 ... 36 . SeñorJarod , five nights and you don 't sleep . - [ Chuckles ] - Hmm ? Too much to do , Blanca . Not enough hours in the day . Jorge ! - ¿ Has leído este libro ? - Si . Mucho . Tengo cinco niños . ¡ Blanca , peryecto . ! ¿ Quién es el hombre en el sombrero amarillo ? Mmm . No sé , señor . - No sé . - [ Sighs ] Gracias . ¿ Blanca ? ¿ Sí ? Would you do me a favor ? - Peter , come on . We don 't have much time . - What 's this about ? It 's about a hundred grand walking out of this casino right under your very nose . Mr. Hanlon . ! From Jarod Felson . He said he 'd meet you in the security bay as soon as he can . [ Jarod ] Somebody has been double-counting the cash outlays . Based on my findings , over a hundred grand is being skimmed off the top ... every Tuesday cash pickup . - You think Davis was behind this ? - I 'm not sure . But it 's bigger than one guy . An accounting scam tied into the armored car courier . For every $ 300,000 that 's deposited on paper ... another hundred grand is being dropped off at a second locale . But if we keep this scam going ... we find out where the locale is ... we can bring down everybody that 's been ripping off the Marquis . Why don 't we just bring in the cops ? Peter , think about this . If you pull this off ... you are gonna be Steve Hanlon 's $ 20 million hero . - The Marquis . Now . - Yes , ma 'am . Why me ? I 'm the new face around here . Nobody 's gonna trust me . But if their courier is greeted by the president of the casino ... he 's gonna play right into your hands . It 's showtime . Where 's Mr. Davis ? [ Clears Throat ] Mr. Davis worked for me in more ways than one . I 'm Peter Morgan . I run the Marquis . It 's business as usual . You understand ? Sure . Business as usual . Take the skim to the drop . Deposit the rest in the bank . - We 'll see you next Tuesday . - Okay . [ Imitates Elvis Presley ] Well , thank you very much . That was exciting ! Guy fell for everything I said . He must be a complete idiot . [ Sighs ] Find him . [ Chuckling ] [ Morgan ] Steve . ! - I didn 't think you 'd be here . - Surprise . - You won 't believe what I 've been doing . - Bet me . Business as usual . Take the skim to the drop . Deposit the rest in the bank . We 'll see you next Tuesday . [ Bernie ] Okay . Steve , I wasn 't really taking the money . We were ... There 's a great deal of unreported cash leaving this casino . I know ! And , uh , we were ... And a great deal of cash is going in your Swiss bank account . - I don 't have a Swiss account . - Oh . Electronic transfers ... for $ 4.6 million . That is your signature , isn 't it ? I didn 't do this . Tell him . Tell him the truth . I am sorry , Mr. Hanlon . I 'm sorry I didn 't catch this sooner . And the figure is closer to 4.8 . Every instinct in my gut told me you were bad news . Steve , I didn 't do anything wrong ... [ Groans , Panting ] Felson , damn it ! I didn 't do anything . I didn 't do anything wrong . Neither did Maggie Blaire . Detective Benson , Homicide . - I 'm looking for a Peter Morgan . - He 's in a meeting right now . [ Thud , Crash ] I think he 's asking for a raise . [ Blow Lands ] - [ Whistling ] - [ Snapping Fingers ] [ Bell Rings ] [ Coins Falling Into Tray ] [ Continues Whistling ] [ Slows , Stops ] Jarod ! Take the rear ! Jarod ! Don 't run ! Please ! There 's nowhere to go . [ Man On Radio ] Security alert . Pool area . My lucky day ! [ Approaching Footsteps Running ] We got your radio call , Mr. Felson . Is there a problem ? Yes , there is . A couple of grifters trying a roulette scam . Call the L. V.P.D. and have them picked up . Let go of me . You might want to strip-search this one . She could be palming chips . Oh , you bastard ! I 'm just doing my job , ma 'am . Head of security , you know . - I will get you . - You wanna bet ? Tails . Come on , lady . Not a paper clip . No trash , no lint . Nothing but this . And the usual . Senor Sydney ? - Dígame . - Para usted . " To the man in the yellow hat . From the monkey who got away . " All right . [ Chuckles ] You 're really gonna release him back into the wild ? That 's the plan . Living creatures , they don 't belong in captivity . [ Hooting Quietly ] [ Chuckles ] [ Mews ]

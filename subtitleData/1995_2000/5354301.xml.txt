 She thinks she is all that , but she is not all that . Oh , no , girlfriend , do not go there . Do not go there ! Oh , damn ! She went there . Well , I better get back to the station . Time to go on duty ? No . I 'm on duty . It 's time to punch out . Well , I 'll see you Thursday , Tommy , at career day . Career day ? What career day ? I 've heard nothing of this . It 's nothing , Dick . It 's just a bunch of bores blabbing on about what they do . You wouldn 't be interested . Wait . Dick not interested in talking about himself ? I know ! That 's insane . Oh , don 't be silly , Tommy . Once your classmates hear me speak , you 'll be the toast of the school . Are you kidding , Dick ? You 're a physics professor . I mean , that 's almost as dorky as ... I got nothing . I 'm stumped . This is outrageous ! I 'm wise . I 'm revered . And I work damn hard ! Who do you think puts food on the table ? I put it there . I 'm going with America 's farmers . There 's food on the table ? Oh , now , stop it . If you people think it 's so easy , why don 't you get a job and work for a change ? I 'm glad that was a question and not an order . Dick : it 's an order ! Well , I 'm glad it 's an order and not a direct order . Dick : it 's a direct order ! I 'm glad it 's a direct order- - Dick : go get the want ads ! Hey , guys . Is Dick here ? No . I wanted to talk to him . Why ? Well , I 'm looking for work . There were some sweet gigs on the Pendleton research board , but I don 't know which one to do , like here . I can get 50 bucks if I let them rub solvents in my eyes . Oh , Sally , that--That 's not good . Really ? Well , I could sign up for the hornet sting study , but I didn 't bring a swimsuit . Dr. Albright is looking for a research assistant . Really ? ! Uh ... yes , but it 's just grunt work . I mean , it doesn 't pay hornet study money . Oh , that 's Ok . What do I have to do ? Uh , well , I 'm giving a talk next week at the faculty club . Some Bolivian professors will be there , and I 'm going to be discussing the culture of the Aymara Indians . And I 'm your date ? No . You 're my fact checker . You just go to the library and make sure all my information is accurate . Hmm , I would 've gone with the hornets . Good morning , Mary . Good morning . Sally , what are you doing here ? Oh , I 'm doing some anthropology stuff for Albright . You 're what ? ! See ya , boss . Well , that 's just great ! You never show any interest in physics ! Well , Dick , there 's good reason for that . It 's physics . Like anthropology is so hot ? I mean , sure , there 's naked people , but ... once you get past that , it 's really just ... what ? I don 't know . I can 't get past the naked people . You know how they say if you really want a job , it 'll just fall right in your lap ? Uh , no . And how desperation is the surest road to success . I never heard that . Why do they say those things ? Why ? I 'm not sure they do . I fell for the lies . Pounded the pavement , and now here I am . There are no jobs for guys like me . You know , I 've been looking for a new bartender for a while now . Do you mind , buddy ? We 're talking about my problems now . I 'm saying I need somebody to start today . Uh , yeah . Well , I guess you 're out of luck . Why , what do you got going on ? I 'm looking for a job , brainiac ! Morning , class , I 'm ... sorry I 'm ... so late . A funny thing happened today . I learned that there is a , uh , A ... small group of people that doesn 't find physics absolutely exhilarating . Isn 't that hilarious ? Exactly . So I was wondering , what drove you to take it ? Well , uh , it 's required . And we want to graduate . So that 's all that brings you back to my class , a requirement ? Not one of you yearns for a career in physics ? Not one soul longs to make physics his lifework ? Not one among you aspires to place physics- - Dr. Solomon . Leon , please , tell me you have to pee . Guess what . What ? I found a mistake in your speech . Oh . Ok . Let 's hear it . Ok . This is so great . Ok . Here on page 2 , you say there aren 't any aymaran communities on the high plains , but dirkson 's survey says there are . No , there aren 't . Yeah , but Dirkson says there are . All right . Maybe there 's one or two , but my point still stands . No . Ok , but Dirkson says- - forget Dirkson ! Just go back there and concentrate on- - on place names and spellings and things like that . Ok ? Man , who died and made her Dirkson ? Look , Sally , if you 're gonna work for Dr. Albright , there are a couple of things you need to understand . One : she doesn 't like to be corrected when she 's wrong . And two : she 's often wrong . Wait , wait . So I shouldn 't tell her her breath smells like a sock full of horseradish ? I didn 't . But , hey , that 's my boss . I just can 't please him . Well , what are you gonna do ? Exactly . I just can 't win . Well , what are you gonna do ? You said it . You know , I got a family to think about . What are you gonna do ? Hey , you know you 're right . Tomorrow , I 'm going down there , and I 'm gonna tell him what he can do with his job . Harry , thanks for listening . Hey , what am I gonna do ? Harry , I need a drink . You and everyone else . I got the whole town of Rutherford drinking again . Harry ! All right ! What is wrong with this world ? You dole out moonshine to a roomful of boozehounds and everybody loves you , while I shape young minds with the elegant laws of physics , and what do I get ? Nothing . Here 's the deal , Dick . Around here , a guy can 't even give peach schnapps away . But you put it in a pineapple glass , add a little umbrella , call it a shooter , I can 't make ' em fast enough . Harry , that 's brilliant ! You 're saying I gotta give physics a little razzle-dazzle , right ? Ok . Of course ! This is the nineties . Kids want what 's cool . They want the latest , the here and now . They want the Fonz ! Ayyy ! What are you gonna do ? I 'm going to career day ! All right ! You do that ! What an idiot . Harry , did some joker put my number up on the men 's room wall ? Ooh , I don 't think so . Well , be a doll and put it up there , will ya ... before that big guy with the beard takes a leak ? Hi . Am I interrupting ? No . Come in . What 's wrong ? Find another mistake ? No . Nothing . Really ? Really . I went through it with a fine-tooth comb . This baby is gold . Great . What about the population of circuata ? I was just guessing on it . That was a guess ? You nailed it ! Well , I 've always been pretty good with trends in that part of the hemisphere . Listen , I gotta tell you , after reading Dirkson , your stuff was refreshing . But substantial , like , uh , Gatorade , but with meat in it . Sally , let me buy you lunch . We can go to the oak room . The oak room ? You deserve a treat . Well , I spent the day with your speech . I think I 've had my treat . Dear god ! They have chocolate cheesecake . Of course , I should probably just apply it directly to my thighs . Ha ha ha ha ha ha ! That 's , oh , so funny ! Oh , yeah . All right . Step right up , kids , and meet the girls of physics . Each and every one of them a bundle of mass and energy . Are you really a licensed bikini inspector ? Uh , kind of . I 'm a physics professor , you understand ? Now , friends , let me tell you about a little thing called physics . You know what makes a car go fast ? Physics . And you know what makes a curve ball curve ? Why , physics ! And you know what 's got me standing here instead of floating out the window like a puff of smoke ? Inertia , with a capital " I. " That rhymes with pi , and that starts with " p , " and that stands for physics . Your father is an insult to this entire school . I don 't see your dad here . Uh , my dad is performing open-Heart surgery right now . Oh , couldn 't cut it as a brain surgeon ? Now , let me tell you about something that 's really hot . Inasmuch as " e " equals cosine " m " plus " I " sine " m , " we get arbitrary values of the separation constant " P. " Now , watch this . I 'm sorry I 'm late , kids , but I was involved in one of the world 's scariest police chases . How 'd it end ? The guy got away . Ohhh ! But I rolled my car . Cool ! Cool ! Oh , man , I want to be a cop . It 's not all glamour , kids , but it 's mostly glamour . Oh , and , uh , guns . Cool ! Cool ! And what makes that policeman 's gun so cool ? Physics ! Kinetic energy generates the velocity with which the bullet exits the barrel , while the ballistic coefficient and sectional density determine the damage to its targets . Guns don 't kill people . Physics kills people ! Oohhh . Ohh ! [ Snaps fingers ] Tony ! Dick , I told you , you shouldn 't have come to career day . Oh , when we first came to this planet , I could 've gotten any job . Cowboy , rock star , international superspy . Why did I choose physics ? Dick , you know what they say . When life gives you lemons , just shut up and eat the damn lemons . Well , I 've had it . I renounce physics and all its uses and applications , including conservation of momentum . Whoo hoo hoo . I 'm out . I 'm out . Hey , guys . Hey . Yo , dubie . Give me a margarita , Harry . What about your job ? I 'm on the job right now , baby . Rocks , no salt . Are you telling me that Mary 's presentation is already perfect ? Well , she thinks it is , and I 'm getting paid not to argue . Ka-Ching ! [ Ding ] You got lucky , damn you . I 'll tell you the secret . You just pucker up , vapor-lock onto your boss ' butt , and hold on . No independent thought required . In fact , it just gets in your way . Free thinkers die in the dirt like dogs , Sally . Here 's your booze . Sally . Dubie , my hollow-legged lady friend . One-eyed jimmy 's gonna go out back and fight a midget . You wanna watch ? Yeah . Let 's go . Citizens . Ah , what 'll it be , officer ? Oh , I 'm just in the neighborhood checking things out . You got it . One free cheeseburger . Don 't be stingy with the onions . Harry , I 'd like a free cheeseburger . You got it . That 'll be 6 bucks . Oh ! That 's it ! I want a new job ! A job that comes with respect , stature , and free cheeseburgers . I want your job . Dick , you don 't know the first thing about being a cop . It 's a gritty job where a good day is one where you come home alive . Isn 't that pretty much a good day for anyone ? [ Police radio chatter ] I gotta go back to the station . They 're bringing in a suspect . Hey , Don , I want to go . I want to hold a gun and flash a badge . I don 't know , Dick . It 's illegal , it 's dangerous , and it violates the sacred oath I took when I joined the force . So don 't tell anyone . Let 's go ! All right , Dick . We 're gonna go in there . We 're gonna do a little thing we like to call " good cop , bad cop . " You 're good cop . I 'm down with that . I 'm glad . All right , here we go . Hi , Jonesy , I 'm Dick . I like your shirt . So , you say that you didn 't rob any gas station . Right , Jonesy ? Yeah . Right . Now , I- - I believe you , but ... the thing is ... you 're scum ! I find chunks of you in my puke ! So don 't you jerk me around ! Dick ! We 'll be right back . You 're supposed to be good cop . I am ! You 're raising the bar too high . You know how bad I have to be now ? Real bad ! I couldn 't help myself . Why don 't you be good cop ? That way , I can go as big as I want . Ok , I 'll be good cop . Oh , well , you 'll have to , uh , excuse my partner . He 's got a real mean streak , but ... I want to help you out . See , I know that you 're a nice- - oh ! We 'll be right back . What 's the matter with you ? I 'm always good cop . This was my one chance to be bad cop . But I 'm a bad good cop . You 're not even a cop ! Well , can 't we both be bad cop ? But the whole concept is- - oh , whatever . Now I want answers ! And I really want answers ! Thank you for inviting me to your conference . How do I look ? You look fine . I love Bolivian men . They 're like Hondurans without all the attitude . Good afternoon , ladies . Oh , Dr. Albright , what a great suit ! Well , thank you , Sally . Sally , you smell like jagermeister . Somebody spilled it on me in the library . Well , once again , I was completely unnecessary . If I didn 't know any better , I 'd swear you were a moron . Aymaran . Aymaran . Come on . We 're your friends . You did it , right ? No . Come on . You can tell us . No . I didn 't do it . Well , so much for good cop , good cop . There 's no such thing ! I told you , there 's only one permutation that works . Ok . I have this idea . Sad cop , somewhat effeminate cop . Get out ! Go home , Dick . You are not cop material . I have to be ! It 's not you . It 's just not you . You 're right . Apparently , I was put on this earth to bore a bunch of unreceptive dimwits to the end of my days . It 's my lot in life . Well , I think we both learned something today . Let 's have lunch sometime . Look . Why don 't you just let me go ? Because I know you did it , Jonesy ! You jumped the fence , and you stole the money . But you got no proof . Besides , I couldn 't jump that fence . It 's physically impossible . Physically impossible ? That 's where you 're wrong . You may not have much respect for the law , Jonesy , but there 's one law that you can 't break : coulomb 's third law of universal gravitation . What ? It states that the force between 2 objects is proportional to the algebraic products of their respective charges , as well as proportional to the inverse square of the distance between them ! But of course , you knew that , didn 't you , Jonesy ? Not--not all of it . You 're object " x , " and the fence is object " Y. " Now , where " v " is the velocity of the 2 objects , and " r " is the distance between them , and " e " is a unit vector directed from the first object to the second , we see that the fence proved little challenge . Well ... I guess . You guess ! I bet you guess . And so we see that " x " equals zero as " y " approaches infinity ! That 's how you avoided the security camera . That 's how you managed to get back over the fence . That 's how they found you exactly 1.3 miles from the crime scene , proving that you and only you could have perpetrated this heinous crime ! There 's the proof ! Ok ! Ok ! Ok ! You got me ! I did it ! I did it ! My god ! What kind of a cop are you ? I 'm not a cop ! I 'm a physics professor ! Of course , my dad didn 't say anything . He never did . And how did that make you feel , Chet ? Angry . Worthless . Oh . But you know that 's not true , now , don 't you , Chet ? Yeah . Yeah , I do . All right ! [ Sighs ] Well ... [ Ding ] Happy hour 's over , Chet . But I think we made some real progress . I feel better . Yeah . And just remember ... don 't stop drinking . Thanks , Harry . All right , buddy . Line ' em up , Harry . 5 martinis . No , Harry . Dr. Albright , we should take you home now . No , Nina . I have brain cells that will remember this evening , and I want them destroyed ! Hey , Dr. Albright , how did your talk go ? How did my talk go ? Let 's see . First of all , the Bolivians were highly amused when I confused the name of their president with the word for kayak . But they stopped laughing when ... in their native tongue , I welcomed them to my ... womany place and told them ... I told them there was room for everyone ! Tell her how you told them that their country was A ... shining example of goat death . I hope this isn 't in any way my fault . It 's all your fault ! You were supposed to check these things ! You 're absolutely right . I let you down completely . Yes , you did ! What were you thinking ? I have no excuse . It 's just--it 's just ... really intimidating when you work for ... for what ? Say it . A bitch ? ! No . A genius ! Well , that 's nice , but ... I 'm a professional , and I expect other people to be professional with me . Of course you do . God , what have I done ? I 've let down the brightest woman alive ! Oh , god ! [ Sobbing ] Oh , Sally . Don 't beat yourself up . Let me buy you a drink . Margarita , rocks , no salt . Harry ! [ Ding ] And so , using coulomb 's third law , I was able to prove that he did it . What does that have to do with it ? Nothing . All I proved was that he 's rotating around the sun . But he didn 't know that . That 's the wonderful thing about physics . Nobody understands it . So you can use your knowledge to bully people into submission . Well , that 's the plan . As long as America 's educational system remains woefully inadequate , I rule . Yes , you really do . What you do is amazing . Thank you , Sally . Sometimes I wish you were dead so they could put you on a stamp . Sally , you 're not kissing my butt , are you ? A man of your stature ? I wouldn 't dare . Well , good . Here 's 20 bucks . Thanks . now that you 're feeling better about your career again , do I have to keep working at the bar ? Oh , no , Harry . Oh , good . There 's just too much pressure . All those people and their problems . No . There 's too much pressure in the soda gun . You could put an eye out . Why do you think they call him one-eyed jimmy ? Wait . He lost his eye from soda ? Yeah . Root beer . No wonder he 's angry . I would be . So how was the fight ? Oh , short .

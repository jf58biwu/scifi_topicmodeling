 Crichton : You are the tastiest thing that I have had since last night . Hey ... Baby , Alex , what 's wrong ? ( sighs ) I 'm taking the Stanford job . Stanford . You know , there are other medical research programs . Not with full grant scholarships . Well , I 've got a shot at the space program here . I know . We 've talked about this , John . Taking a break . It 's not a break , Alex , if you 're all the way across the continent . I know it may not seem like it now , but ... I 'll always be there for you . Well , if we 're meant to be together , we 'll be together . I love you . I love you . ( loud explosion ) D 'argo : Pilot ! Pilot : I have no answers as yet . A little long for a starburst , don 't you think ? Hail Prince of the Obvious . About time . Now explain yourself . Pilot : I told you , I did not initiate starburst , nor did I terminate it . Then who did ? Moya . She thought she heard the distress cry of another pregnant Leviathan and was attempting to locate the source . I like my wives pregnant and my ships cold to the touch . That way , my feet stay warm and my slumber is uninterrupted . " Wives , " plural ? Big fella . I was just dreaming about my final mating session when our gestating goliath decided she needed some exercise . That 's my underwear . What does this say ? Calvin . Then they 're not yours . D 'argo : This is strange . I dreamt of mywife last night . About the last night we spent together before she was murdered . That was my dream . No , no , no . Not ... not yourwife . Someone I cared about . What about you girls ? Sex dreams ? I sleep soundly . I am unimpressed by your masculine reveries . Pilot , has Moya found the ship she 's looking for ? Yes ... and no . There does not appear to be another Leviathan , let alone a pregnant one in distress . Then why are we here ? Hmm ... We 're receiving a transmission . Salutations . I apologize for the deceit but there was no other way our signal could reach across the void . And we so want to meet you ... Pa 'u Zotoh Zhaan . My name is John Crichton , an astronaut .. . ... a radiation wave hit and I got shot through a wormhole .. . Now I 'm lost in some distant part of the universe on a ship . A living ship full of strange alien life-forms .. . Help me .. . Listen , please . is there anybody out there who can hear me ? ... being hunted by an insane military commander .. . ... doing everything I can .. . I 'm just looking for a way home . Tahleen : Upon landing , our vessel heats the rock to molten , then settles below ground . That 's your ship ? Must have been one hell of an impact . It 's a missionary habitat . It 's clever . Decreases the likelihood of an enemy being able to spot you from space . It 's always instructive how different cultures view the same reality . Where a Peacekeeper sees defense from attack , we see solitude for piety . Pa 'u Tahleen , your use of deception continues to trouble me . Tahleen : Perhaps our many cycles of reclusion contributed to an error in judgment , but we could think of no other way of leading you here . Let us replenish at the Altar of Essence . In the sweet air , you 'll soon forget this world 's toxic surface . Toxic . That figures . Welcome to the New Moon of Delvia , our modest temple to the Goddess of Spiritual Renewal . ( whispering ) : You weren 't supposed to bring a weapon . That 's why D 'argo stayed on the ship . D 'argo is young ; I am cautious . I understand your vessel is low on supplies . Lorana will show you to our food source . Please be greedy . The more you pick the more that grows to replaces it . ( whispering ) : It 's so perfect , my teeth ache . Well , that 's from all the sincerity . Why did you lure us here ? Search yourself , Zhaan . You know why . I do not . What I do know is you invaded my soul last night and you left me bitter . Your friends were happy with their remembrances , were they not ? So you caused me to remember . We always remember , Zhaan . We simply choose to ignore . Whoa ! There you go . An " untended renewable " that 's part plant , part animal , total nutrition . What 's not to like ? This place . These people . Their serenity . Well , at least you 've thought out your position , Aeryn . Amazes me how people mistake theosophy for superiority . You know , I don 't think anything amazes you . I mean , look at this . You ever seen one of these before ? What would you call this ? I dub thee , trigopod . And , what , you 're just ... no ! No ... no reaction from you . Incredible . How special . They 're a food source , John . No , Aeryn , it 's unique . It 's a squid calamari cucumber , and it is incredible . Look up . Look at this . This is a ship , Aeryn . And it 's incredible . It 's also a little creepy . Tahleen : Look around , Zhaan . Crichton : Okay ? Almost everything we see , almost every day is brand new to both of us . And it 's worthy of a response . On the other hand , it is a little creepy . You know our cause is just . I sympathize , but I cannot help you . Then give us the powers to help ourselves . When did the madness begin ? Only recently but already , Pa 'u Tuzak is beyond redemption . You went too fast , didn 't you ? That is why we must have your secret , before we are all consumed . I have no secret , Tahleen . I am just me . All that hatred and anger . You shouldbe insane . I was insane . I don 't know how I survived those early cycles . But you did . So how does the pious Zhaan coexist with all that rage ? Share with me . Save me . And in return , I will show you paths to abilities beyond your comprehension . Mom ! Mom ! Look at the water snakes ! They 're huge ! John , come away from there before you fall in ! Mom ! Help me ! Mom ! Mom ! Help ! Help ! What ? Geez ! What is it ? There 's um ... stuff in the water . I mean , uh ... Miracles of the mind . You altered his memory . Help me to understand your powers and I 'll help you to understand mine . Put him back and make him as he was . You are the most bizarre creature I have ever met . Any word ? Aeryn and Crichton have close to a 40-day supply of fresh food on the transporter already . Excellent . What 's the matter ? is there food I won 't like ? Something Crichton said is disturbing me . Finally . I 've been saying that since he arrived . It 's what he said about us all having the same dream . It wasn 't the same . Mine was better than yours . I sense Delvian trickery here , Rygel . We must leave this place . Get the food first . Do not touch . The Sanctity Root . Poison to your hand . Death . Oh ... right . Um ... well , thanks . And you 're , um ... ? Tuzak : Teacher-Leader - Holy Reaper-Seeker of the Flame . I am here because of you ... Peacekeeper . I 'm not a Peacekeeper . Yes , you are . I am insane . Yeah . That would have been my next guess . Insane because of you . Because I touched inside what I needed to touch you outside . Right . One you travel with is in peril . Aeryn ? No , Aeryn 's not a Peacekeeper . Not yours , mine ! Zhaan . Vigilance , Peacekeeper . Confusing times . Do not touch the root . You are forbidden in this sanctuary . - l was just looking for the meditation room . - You also carry a prohibited weapon . I appreciate your rules , but I was allowed to ... A Peacekeeper lie . I have been driven from my homeland by your kind . I will not be driven from here also . It is you who must go . This is wrong , Lorana . We 're far outside our vows . What choice do we have , Hasko ? That is Tahleen talking , not you . Don 't be blinded by her madness . I pity you , your jealousy . Tahleen and I share Unity now , not you and I . Accept that and move on . ( group chanting ) Zhaan , I just heard that Aeryn got booted out of the temple . Yes . She 's already taken a transport pod . She 's gone . What ? Wait a minute . No , no , she left without us ? No. I wanted her to . I need you to help me make a decision . Look , if you want to stay here , that 's fine . We can take these people on Moya . We have no star charts or reference points home to Delvia . We prefer not to wander . Oh , that makes sense . Hell , everybody 's lost in this corner of the universe anyway . John , John . You asked if I dreamt the other night . I did . I , too , was reminded of the last person I ever loved . Open your mind . John , you must keep an open mind . Are you sure , Zhaan ? His capacity is well below even a level one . He will understand . You must . Show him . Show him . In the fires of Tadesh , I search for Unity with you , my companion . Oh magnificent Zhaan , Ease the burdens of my flesh with your soul . Envelop me . Release your mind , Bitaal . Surrender your demons , for l have others to replace them . What are you doing ? Avenging the lives you have ruined and the world you put at risk . No , Zhaan ! Zhaan ! ( crying ) What the hell was that ? The crime I was imprisoned for . You ... you ... you killed a guy you were having sex with . I admit I have not revealed all parts of myself to you . No . No , you haven 't ! You killed the guy you were having sex with , Zhaan ! I need you , John. I needyou . For what ? Target practice ? ! I am adrift . As the past is sweeping over me I must rely on the judgment of someone I trust . Please understand . Please . You want me to understand ? Then tell me , why the hell did you show me that ? Because they want me to do it again . Bitaar was our spiritual counselor , John . He was a very powerful man . I was studying with him at the time and things just took their course . Why did you kill him , Zhaan ? His tenure was up . Instead of yielding control , he and the other conservative Pa 'us hired the Peacekeepers for external security . Our world changed forever . Delvian coup d 'etat . I didn 't think you people had it in you . Peacekeepers rounded up all the liberal thinkers and voices of protest . My own father was sent to an asteroid camp . He may still be there for all I know . Was that before or after you killed Bitaar ? I loved Bitaar , John . And these people ... Tahleen and the others , they want you to kill again ? Not by my own hand . They want me to help them regain power . And so-so ... so what are you supposed to do ? Serve as poster child for the revolution ? As we train for purity , Delvians often become vulnerable to their own dark impulses . Should it surface , they succumb as if to an infection . is that what happened to Grandpa Loony Tunes ? And now madness is threatening his followers , too . But not you . No , you 're as ... twisted as they come ... but you 're still sane . Exactly . I can help these people , John . How ? Through Unity . The sacred surrender of two minds together . Two spirits , two souls . Wait , w ... no , just back up . You 're telling me you 're going to give a piece of your mind , a piece of your soul to one of these people ? Am I just being stupid here or does that sound a little crazy in its own right , Zhaan ? It is crazy , John . But where there is risk , there is also hope . Look , couldn 't it wait until we 've loaded more supplies ? This trigopod is mythic . Oh ! You say it 's part vegetable ! Anymore from Crichton ? He says they want Zhaan to participate in some sort of ceremonial mating . This is such a bad combination . I never should have left them . Zhaan distracted , Crichton confused . Crichton is always confused . Pilot , prepare the transport pod . We 're heading back to the planet . Very well . Oh , wait for me ! If we spent another thousand cycles here , we couldn 't find the strength that that woman can give us in an instant . The Peacekeeper has signaled her intention to return with the Luxan . Stop them . Let nothing distract Zhaan from what I want her focused on . The one Crichton is challenging her with questions . I can send him back to his ship . No , she wants him here . Their minds are weak . Preoccupy them all as you would children . Attack them with their own hopes and fears . is that how you would treat your children , Lorana ? So , what 's the story ? When do we go ? Who the hell are you ? You don 't recognize me ? Oh , I recognize who you 're supposed to be , Alex . What 's wrong with you ? What 's wrong with this picture ? Why aren 't you in your lab at Stanford ? I never went to Stanford , John . I joined the space program with you . Remember ? Yeah , I ... but , Alex ... how did you get here ? The same way as you . Or doesn 't being your co-pilot count ? Smile , baby , this is for my Mom . Remember now ? ( coughing ) Took you long enough . I had to get up the nerve . I know who you are . I know who you are . I do respect your teachings , Pa 'u Tuzak . And I respect your choice of murder victims . What are you doing here ? The young refuse to tend the orchard . Sanctity Roots don 't grow on trees , my dear . I need your advice . Uh-uh ... I have tasted of my darker impulse , so I 'm ... I 'm insane . What I am contemplating is also a little insane . Ah . Pa 'u . Ninth Level ? ( dry coughing ) When the darkness rises up from inside , that is normal . It 's when you reach down to pull it up ... that the noxious warnings sound . Should I give Tahleen what she wants ? Oh , she would like that . Will she use the ability I give her to hurt people ? Certainly . But she may also free a planet from tyranny . ( Hasko chanting ) If you hear nothing from us , come down immediately . Yes , of course , my thought exactly . Aeryn , are you ready ? Ready . Are you ready ? My pulse rifle just fell apart . What are you talking about ? Just pick it up . It 's in pieces , D 'argo . I don 't know what happened . What happened is , you ... are wasting ... my time . I don 't have any training to use this bit . Pilot , are there any Delvian transmissions coming to Moya ? Boy : Daddy ! Daddy ! Jothee ... Jothee . Daddy ! Help me ! Peacekeepers ! Pilot ! Seal all the exits ! There are Peacekeepers on board ! Rygel , can you help me with this ? ( agonized scream ) What made you decide to share Unity with me ? The potential . If you have even the slightest doubt , we must refrain . I will give you what you wish . What do you need ? The smallest seed . Point me to the knowledge , and I will spend my life mastering it . Both : I am yours . Your spirit is raging . You strive for so much . And yours is so calm . I will show you ... what you want ... so you might ... ease your soul . ( painful whimpering ) What are you doing , Tahleen ? I 'm sorry , Zhaan , but what you have achieved will take me too long to master on my own . No ! Forgive me , Pa 'u , but I must have all of what I need . You betrayed me . What 's up ? What happened ? I made a mistake . Why-why are your eyes red ? It 's tissue bile migrating to my brain . ( chuckles ) Madness ? Maybe . My dark impulses are released . She ripped from me my ability to control them . Then go take them back . It doesn 't work like that . I 'd have to start over . Zhaan , you 're in a temple surrounded by the Goddess . If you can do it in a Peacekeeper cell , you can do it ... I spent nearly 1 7 cycles tortured by my own dark impulses . Feeling insanity 's grip ebb and flow . I don 't have the strength to start again ! No , just ... just stay put . Stay put . We 're not done yet . Crichton : Tahleen ! Tahleen ! Tahleen ! Alex , where 's Tahleen ? Lotus position somewhere . John , sit down . She screwed over Zhaan . That was Zhaan 's choice . Let it go . No , but you should see her . And you should see me . John , we made a promise to always be there for each other . Wait , wait , wait . When have I not been there for you ? Whenever anybody else needs you . Alex ... Zhaan is our friend . Who made a choice to stay with her own kind . Accept it . Do you remember the night that we made love in the reflecting pool at Canaveral ? Pilot : Crichton , are you there ? Yo , Pilot , what 's up ? I 'm afraid everyone up here is behaving rather strangely . D 'argo : Jothee ! Jothee , where are you , boy ? Jothee , where are you ? Pilot , I demand that you help me find my son . Now ! I 'm sure you heard that . How 's Aeryn ? Just as bad . ( laughing ) : I am not as bad as that . I just , um ... I ... I can 't figure out how these controls work . And Rygel is faring no better . He somehow thinks he has shrunk to even smaller dimensions . I 'm on it , Pilot . ( sighs ) This is a pretty sacred place , isn 't it ? You think you still belong here ? Tahleen : There are over a billion Delvians living in fear on our home world . Crichton : And you 're going to save them , right ? Not alone . It will take many dedicated to freedom . But it serves no end if I go insane before ... This isn 't about freedom . It 's about power . You know , your friend really is a remarkable woman . Whatever you 've done to my friend , you put it right . incapacitate him , Lorana . Even if you have to destroy his mind . Why not just let them go ? You already have what you want . Because I have not . Zhaan held too tightly to her secret . I didn 't get enough to quell the madness . She will forge another Unity with Zhaan and most likely kill her in the process . Hey ! Where have you been ? Oh ! Dealing with Zhaan and the blue people . How are we going to get back on Moya ? I don 't know . Look , Alex , let me ask you a question . Have you noticed anything unusual that might indicate that they 've been messing with our minds ? The only person messing with my mind , John , is you . I don 't have time for this right now , okay ? I am serious . And you don 't think I am ? When am I going to become more important to you than Zhaan ? I never gave you that . Hi . Baby , what 's wrong ? I 'm scared . Yeah , right , you 're scared . What ? Well , when I agreed to pass on Stanford and go with you ... What if things don 't work out between us and I 'm stuck in Florida , alone ? You will never , ever be stuck alone , I promise . Now how am I going to hold you to that one ? Alexandra Kimberly O 'connor , marry me . You never gave me this ? No , I mean , I remember giving you the ring . I just don 't remember ... And I promise never to place another before me , till death do us part . You don 't remember what , John ? Marrying me ? Yeah , of course . I 'm ... Do you want it back ? No ! No , no . Never . Then honor your vow , or choose Zhaan over me and take the ring . If you return to Delvia , many may be tempted to seek your word , barely coherent , over mine . Oh , they wouldn 't listen to me , my daughter . You didn 't . On the contrary , all those cycles growing up ... I listened . When I brought you all here to accelerate your teaching , it was to create a new class of Pa 'u , a better class . And in your legacy , we will shine on . You go too fast . Pillaging knowledge without the wisdom to control it . I mean , learn from my error , Tahleen . I have . Even now , insanity creeps upon me . But rather than sit idly by tending trees that will not grow , I take action for myself , and for my homeland . What you do is worse than the insanity you seek to stave off ! You 're quite lucid today , father . No ! ( gasping ) Zhaan . Come back to Moya with us . No , Tahleen needs me . I will be a Pa 'u , dedicated to helping others . After all she 's done ? Yes. I will join in Unity with her one more time . You know , you 're full of it . You 're going to kill her , aren 't you ? Just like you did your lover . You were always the most clever one on Moya , but I will not miss you . Zhaan , just stop . Stop thinking about Tahleen . I want you to think about yourself for a little while . The urge to give retribution is intoxicating . I have missed it . You know , Alex said that you were going to do this . That you 'd quit . Alex ? Who is Alex ? Alex . My wife . I should not have brought you here . Let 's face it . We have both lost . ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) Why do you care for Zhaan so much ? Huh ? What kind of question is ... ? Why is Zhaan so important to you ? Honey , think of all the times she 's put herself on the line for us . Not for me , John . You know what ? This is stupid . She likes you . She can 't like me , because she doesn 't even know me . What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm not here , John . I 've never been . Baby , they are messing with your mind . You flew with me . We share quarters on Moya . Forced memories to distract you . You 're real . No . I love you . I release you from what is not true . How in God 's name do you call yourself a priest ? I have no excuse . So what now ? Kill me ? Cage me ? Teach me tricks ? Your feelings for Zhaan , I share them , too ... and for you and the others . We have fallen off the path . The Sanctity Root around which our temple revolves represents purity of thought and intent . Your tree ... it 's twisted on itself . Whilst in your mind , you have showed me the ember of my own virtue . Next time , ask . If you are willing to take the risk , you may be able to accomplish the same result with Zhaan . Hasko : I am sorry but you must focus on this moment . Your friends ' lives hang in the balance . I get a vote . I say we go down and shoot them all . Oh ! Look , D 'argo almost stepped on me . Pilot : Your eminence you were never any smaller than your current stature . Hasko : You must not invade our temple . The balance is very delicate . Please , I have restored your memories . Now , allow us to do it our way . You have two arns . That 's all . Why do you disturb me as I prepare for Unity with Zhaan ? Because what you are doing is wrong . Such simple analysis from a vessel I poured much effort into . How disappointing . If you thought so little why choose Unity with me in the past ? Because you were too foolish to look deeper and question me . You were easy and pleasurable . Pardon the intrusion , Pa 'u , but I think you should know ... Zhaan and Crichton have fled to the surface in an attempt to reach their ship . Then I must stop them . Where is she ? The part of Tahleen in tonight 's Unity will be played by John Crichton . You wish to share Unity with me ? Well you guys are always going on about how hot it is . I thought I 'd give it a go . This is not sex . The fusion of our two minds will surely kill you . Not if you 're careful . I hear you can protect me ... if you want to . I see no purpose to this union . ( clucking ) Your translator microbes handle that one ? Although I must admit , I have always wondered what could possibly go in there . Not a lot . I 'm a guy . Come on , Zhaan . What are you afraid of ? ( grunts ) Take my head . Our two spirits will pass into each other until we inhabit a single consciousness . Too late to be afraid . Move into me . Oh , my . What is that ? Unity . It 's like Disney on acid . Ten years of really great sex all at the same moment . ( chuckles softly ) My God , what is that ? What is ... The core of my soul . The part of me that is capable of murder . Wh-what ... what 's happening ? What ... what 's happening to me ? Focus on something else , John . Do not absorb any of my rage . ( whimpers ) All right . All right . I 'm all right . We must separate now , John . I don 't know how long l can protect you . No . There 's something in me that you need to see . ( chuckles ) Look at yourself ... as I see you . Gentle , giving . That 's you , Zhaan . Tahleen can 't take that , and she didn 't . You 're still that Pa 'u . Follow me , Zhaan . See what I see . Build on that peace . ( gasping softly ) Be her again . ( groaning ) ( groaning ) Zhaan ? Zhaan ! Fight it . Fight all the things that betray you . ( groaning ) Zhaan . Thank you , John . How come ... I can 't remember ? The details of another 's mind fade after Unity . But the essence of bonding remains . Tahleen : Stop ! How dare you ! This tree is the center of your existence , right ? The source of your goodness ? Spiritual flame ? Well , burn down the temple sister , just ' cause you 're a bastard sect in any religion . I will destroy your useless mind ! How did you block him from me ? Unity also gifted me with a part of you , Tahleen . I am now a Pa 'u of the Tenth Level , able to protect . ( rumbling ) We want the same things , Zhaan . No , we don 't . You reach for the dark impulses I leave behind . We all visit the precipice . Each one of us must find our own way down . With your father gone , he will need you to tend to his orchard . John ? ( drops ax ) It 's okay . Crichton : What are you doing ? The vestments of a Pa 'u . Feels like a shroud . I 'm no longer worthy . You do that and she wins . It 's not about winning , John . Each day infuses us with a knowledge we carry into tomorrow . I ... I will be a Pa 'u again , but I 'm not today . Seems a shame . Waste all those years of training . Hardly wasted . They were the best cycles of my life .

 The deceased is not to be picked up until this coming Saturday ? Yes , just after dawn . Um , details for the arrangements are all there . And a choice of casket and cemetery . I would prefer a quiet service . Of course , Miss Will . The deceased was your father ? Is my father . If your father is still alive , then why ... Just have a casket ready Saturday morning . Please . [ Engine Starts ] [ Young Jarod ] I don 't wanna die . But I know it 's too late to change any of that . [ Young Sydney ] There 's nothing you wanna confess ? [ Young Jarod ] You keep asking me for the truth ... when that 's all I 've ever given you . [ Young Sydney ] Even in the face of death , you maintain your innocence . Yes . He 's innocent , Sydney . An innocent man is going to die . [ Man ] Off the bus . ! Move it . ! Move it . ! Move it . ! You heard the man , side by side . ! Line up and shut up . ! Let 's go . ! Move it . ! Welcome to Oakfield Penitentiary , gentlemen . Sound off . [ Man Narrating ] [ Sydney ] There 's been a breakthrough concerning Jarod 's next destination . " Top Hat Café pay phone . January , weekend of the 15th ... meeting with cowboy regarding Parker brothers . " I don 't have a brother , do I , Sydney ? That I don 't know . What we do know is the 15th is this coming weekend ... and that note is distinctly written in Jarod 's hand . - Cleanup team find this ? - In Jarod 's last lair ... stuck in the toilet pipe after having been flushed . Okay , the arrangements are all set , Sydney . Uh , oh , uh ... Go on , Broots . What arrangements ? Mr. Broots will be joining us . Uh , the director thinks a little technical support might help . Technical support ? Well , she thinks that some details are getting overlooked ... that you and Sydney are maybe a little too emotionally involved with Jarod . And you 're the fix ? Well ... [ Snickers ] An ... An objective eye , maybe . Uh , I 'll get the car . [ Whistling ] Duller than hockey in September . [ Man ] Never forget , Mr. Bradley , that in this place ... we are dealing strictly with a mentality of desperation . A desperation born from being locked down in a 10-by-10 cell ... for 20 , 30 years , sometimes longer . I would say that desperation was a good word for that , sir . A man 's fiber , if he had any to begin with , quickly frays . It 's yourjob to keep those frayed ends knotted . You 're here because of your experience under duress . With the Carl Will execution on Saturday , there promises to be plenty of that . Sounds like he 's got all the classic symptoms of a career criminal . Carl Will has a criminal record dating back 30 years . Car theft , armed robbery ... a dozen other felony violations leading to the brutal murder of a fellow inmate . You worked Folsom during the ' 91 inmate riot . I 'm proud to say that we squelched that one with extreme prejudice . We don 't wipe noses . We don 't lend shoulders to cry on . We manage , Mr. Bradley , with , as you say , extreme prejudice . I 'm sure the execution will send a message to the entire population . That 's the idea . He 's not in there , and none of the locals have seen him . - Mm-hmm . - [ Clears Throat ] Maybe we should stake him out . They didn 't let you have a weapon , did they ? No . And where do you propose we do our stakeout ? Right there . [ Man ] So , Jarod , how many men did they run on a shift at Folsom ? Oh , we had a crew of 35 during the week , slightly less on the weekends . I hear Warden Harper 's a tough man . His name is Hopkins . - Right , Hopkins . - Morris . Ah , Jarod Bradley , Tommy Larson . Bradley . The guy from Folsom ? - And all points west . - Tommy can show you around . Uh , keep both eyes open . The animals are getting restless . Let me take you out , show you the main yard . Most of the population spends four or five hours a day here . Different zoo , same routine . Gotta make sure they don 't kill each other and herd ' em in at the bell . Seems tense . Yeah , well , it 'll ease up after the , uh , the event . - The event ? - Execution . You get it up close and personal . New guy gets death watch . - Why me ? - I don 't know how it was at Folsom ... but around here , it 's considered bad luck to get too close to a condemned man . They make the new guy do it . [ Man ] Walkin 'through . Is that him ? [ Buzzer Buzzes ] - Larson . - What ? Is that the man they 're going to kill ? Yeah , that 's him . [ Miss Parker ] What do you mean you 're booked up ? Who the hell would purposely stay ... at the Park Place Motel ? Well , we got a convention . The electric company booked the entire facility . - Do you know this man ? - Jarod . Yeah , he comes through here every now and then . Matter of fact , he said something about passing through this weekend . Got a meeting or something . I 'll tell you what . You being friends of his and all , you and your brother and ... and your dad ... you can stay in the celebrity room that I keep open for special guests . Celebrity room . Burl Ives stayed here once . We even had Mama Cass . Not to mention that Osmond boy . You know , the goofy-looking one with the ... the big ears . You know , I bet it wasn 't Donny . Mail call for inmate Cockran . Thanks . Oh , I 'm sorry . I wasn 't watching where I was going . You okay , boss ? I 'm fine . And the name is Jarod , Mr ... Cockran , Henry . Well , it 's nice to meet you , Henry . [ Buzzer Buzzes ] - You 're new around here . - Yes , I am . - And you ? - Oh , I 've been walking these halls for 27 years . That 's a long time . There isn 't a cockroach I 'm not on a first name basis with . - Is that mail from home ? - Uh , my wife . She writes me every week like clockwork . Sends me seeds for my garden . These should be marigolds . Cockran . You got somewhere to be , old-timer ? Kitchen , boss . That what they call extreme prejudice at Folsom ? You have to know your enemy . [ Male Reporter ] Tonight we bring you a story of love , law ... and its connection between a man on death row ... and a daughter whose life has been a fight to free him . Ten years ago , Carl Will , a career criminal ... was sentenced to five years for car theft . Only weeks away from parole , he was involved in a bloody altercation ... inside Oakfield Penitentiary , in which inmate Anthony Lewis was stabbed to death . After a speedy trial conducted by then state attorney ... and present governor Charles Edwards ... Will was convicted of first-degree murder ... and sentenced to die in the gas chamber ... which is where the story takes a most unusual turn . At the time of Will 's initial arrest , his daughterJessica was a senior in high school . Jessica 's belief in her father fueled her to spend the next seven years ... in college and law school , and every day since , fighting to free her father . But with the governor 's denying final appeal ... and the execution scheduled for midnight Friday ... her odyssey oflaw and love appears to be at an end . [ Jessica 's Voice ] I love my father , I believe in him ... and I will never stop fighting . How do you respond toJessica Will 's call for clemency from the governor ? The governor 's refusal is the only answer I need . Miss Will calls the quick processing of her father ... a political act by Governor Edwards based on his reelection law and order platform . - How do you answer that ? - No one doubts Miss Will 's love or devotion to her father ... but she is working from emotion , and we 're working from fact . [ Man ] Warden , what facts are those ? Officers Clancy and Larson found Carl Will next to the body of Anthony Lewis ... holding the murder weapon . Unfortunate as it is , when you concentrate transgressors in the system ... these things happen , but they won 't be tolerated by me or the governor . The time has come for us to do our job , and we 're going to do it at dawn Saturday . - Thank you . - [ Reporters Clamoring ] [ Buzzer Buzzing ] Didn 't you hear it 's bad luck being around a dead man ? Well , I 'm the new guy . I have no choice . - Bon appétit . - I 'm not hungry . It 's grilled porterhouse steak , medium rare . Poached snap beans . That 's what I ordered for my last meal . I know . That wasn 't supposed to be for , uh , two days . Well , it 's your favorite . I figured why wait . They move in on you , don 't they ? The walls . You stare at them long enough , and you swear they start creeping in on you . You sound like a man that 's been on this side of the bars . It 's tough ... when you don 't belong there . You 're innocent ... at least that 's what you keep saying . Nobody 's listening . I am . You 're telling me a man wearing that uniform hasn 't heard this story ? I 've heard the story . I 'm interested in the truth . I was headed back to Block " C " from laundry detail . I heard voices . Some people struggling down the gantry . Turned around to see what the commotion was . Got knocked out . Woke up in this nightmare . Corn bread or fritters ? Fritters . Just like you asked . Just the wayJessica asked . She arranged all this . She loves you very much . Bradley . The prisoner 's meal is delivered . [ Over Listening Device ] Oh , darlin ' , I miss you so damn bad . I ache all over thinking how pretty you looked laying in that bathtub . That Mr. Bubble dancing on your skin like a love potion . And you stood up and I drank in the vision of your peryectly shaped ... [ Turns Off Device ] [ Clears Throat ] Phone tap seems to be working . I guess I 'll poke around the room for signs ofJarod . I 'm going to go out of my mind . You 're welcome to borrow one of my books if you want . You 're welcome to borrow one of my books if you want . " Relative Thinking . ' " " The Inner Mind . ' " My God ! Sydney , is Jarod all you think about ? Because you don 't ? - There is a lot more to life than Jarod . - Such as ? Such as fun . Such as sex . Interesting that in a conversation aboutJarod , you mention sex . Well , nothing in the toilet . How long has it been since you 've been with a woman , Sydney ? Sydney 's private life is not a subject for public discussion . Well , it 's not healthy , you know , keeping all of that animal emotion bottled up . Next thing you know , you 'll be on the roof with a rifle in your hands . You know , I 've been seeing a woman . Really . Broots . Tell us about her . There 's not much to tell really . We ... We met online . You pick up women on the computer ? How romantic . Details . Well , uh , she 's an accountant . She has three dogs and a bird . And , uh , oh ! And she 's a hugeJohn Tesh fan . Sounds like a real wildcat . What 's she look like ? You know , I think , uh , I should start dusting for prints . We haven 't actually met ... yet . You are pathetic . God , can they make it any hotter in here ? [ Miss Parker Groaning ] - [ Sydney ] You all right , Miss Parker ? - I 'm okay . It 's this , uh , swill from that greasy spoon . How much more exciting can this get ? Look , Monopoly . [ Country ] Psst . Psst . Yeah , it 's amazing what they let sit down in this place . Mm , you smell something ? [ Sniffing ] Smells like somebody 's about to fry . Would you just leave me alone ? Please . - What you gonna do if I don 't ? Huh ? - [ Door Bells Ring ] Pull out one of them knives like your daddy did ? Stick me with it ? Jessica . Hi , honey . Sorry I 'm late . Traffic was a bear . You will excuse us , won 't you , gentlemen ? - Thank you . - Bet that 's happening a lot these days . You have no idea . You 're a guard from the prison . - I 'm off duty . - It 's nothing personal ... but it 's just guards aren 't high on my list of dinner companions . I just shared a meal with your father . He misses you very much . Why are you here ? Fate . And I don 't think your father deserves his . My mother left when I was little , but he never left me . We lived in this rusted-out Airstream for most of my life . You know , we didn 't have much ... but he always made sure I had what I needed . Look , I 'm not saying that my father is the epitome of virtue . I mean , he was ... he was pretty wild when he was younger . But stealing cars and committing murder ... are worlds apart . He spent five years in that lockup . He was a week away from parole . He had a job on the outside ... and I was on the outside . He wouldn 't have done that to me . Did you know Monopoly was developed by Charles Darrow ... an unemployed heating engineer from Germantown , Pennsylvania in 1935 ? Yeah , that 's fascinating . The game was originally rejected for containing 52 fundamental errors ... but there still have been over 100 million sets sold worldwide . You sound like quite an expert on the subject . Monopoly club , high school . What a surprise . [ Groans ] Miss Parker , you all right ? It 's just so damn hot in here . You know ... [ Clears Throat ] there 's something wrong with this game . [ Grunts ] There 's something wrong with this whole damn thing . No , there 's , uh ... [ Clears Throat ] there 's something missing here . [ Grunts ] The only thing missing is Jarod . - [ Groans ] - Miss Parker ! Get a doctor now . ! [ Computer Beeps ] [ Beeps ] [ Beeps ] [ Beeps ] [ Inmates Chattering ] Narcissus . I call them daffodils . They 're my wife 's favorite . Well , I can see why . They 're beautiful . Talk like that , and no one will believe you 're really a bull . Only thing the other guards know how to grow is resentment . [ Man ] Walkin 'through . Is it always this tense around here before an execution ? Always . Did you know Anthony Lewis ? No . He 'd only been here a couple of days . Couple of days ? Hardly seems long enough ... for Carl Will to grow to hate him enough to wanna kill him . Strange things happen in stir . Like the other inmates who have died in here ? Seven in the last five years . All accidents ? It 's a lot more than the national average . I wouldn 't know anything about that . Oh , come on , Henry , you 're on a first name basis with the roaches around here . What happened with Anthony Lewis ... and the other dead inmates ? Prison 's a place to keep your head down and your mouth shut . Especially this place . And this warden . [ Whistle Blows ] Let 's move it in . [ Young Jarod ] I have two minutes left to live . My mouth is dry . I 'm calm , but I 'm scared . I feel my heart pounding in my ears . [ Young Sydney ] It 's time to tell the truth . - I did . - This is your last chance . I did tell the truth . You 're about to die . Clear your conscience . It is clear . I 'm at peace . Rosenberg was telling the truth , Sydney . He didn 't give the secrets away . - Are you sure ? - Yes . Aren 't you ? [ Young Sydney ] Yes . [ Young Jarod ] But if they knew he was innocent ... why did they execute him ? [ Young Sydney ] What do you think ? Because someone had to be guilty . [ Cell Door Clattering ] Tighten it . I don 't want the prisoner to go into spasm and break those straps . Initiate the sequence . [ Breathing Heavily ] Larson , drop the pellets . [ Beeps ] - Why the hesitation ? - Mistake in communications , sir . It won 't happen at showtime . [ Warden ] Yeah , well , see that it doesn 't . 'Cause we 're gonna have a roomful of press back there for the real execution ... and I don 't wanna have to kill Carl Will twice . - Get him out of there . - [ Larson ] Yes , sir . Thanks , Bradley . Do you know what 's wrong with me or not ? I think you have an ulcer . And from the way you were folded up when I got here , it 's a doozy . - What can be done ? - For now , I 'm going to prescribe ... a mild acid inhibitor . I 'm not sure that it will be helpful ... given the fact that she smokes ... and has an unusually stressful demeanor . You can say that again . I don 't know what it is you do , Miss Parker ... but it 's eating you away from the inside out . You 're going to have to change your lifestyle ... - or else . - Or else what ? You could die . I suggest that you learn to control your emotions . Like your father here . Have a pleasant evening . - [ Sydney ] Thank you , Doctor . - [ Broots ] Thanks , Doc . He 's right , you know . If you don 't keep those feelings aboutJarod in check ... it could be your ruin . It 's a little late to be worried about my ruin . [ Clamoring ] My flowers . ! Break it up ! - No , boss ! - [ Warden ] Clancy . ! Clean up this mess . Get ' em back in their cages now . [ Man ] All right , clear the yard . ! Move it . ! You ever make a move like that on me again , I 'll put you in this plot . I just didn 't want my flowers trampled . Well , that won 't be a problem now , will it ? - You okay ? - Sure . Fine . You 're sure ? I don 't understand . If these letters aren 't real , wh ... I don 't understand . If these letters aren 't real , wh ... Where 's my wife ? She died three years ago . Cancer . - I 'm sorry . - Pretty pathetic , huh ? No . You lock a man away long enough ... it bends him ... sometimes till he breaks . Rita and me were married 43 years . You didn 't know that , did you ? No , I didn 't . I broke the law , and I 've paid every day for the last 27 years . But there 's certain things that a man ... can 't allow to be taken from him . His pride , his dignity . I understand rules . But what Warden Michaels did to me was wrong . All I wanted was to be there when ... my Rita was laid down . I put her through a lot of pain . And I just wanted to be able to put flowers on her grave ... and feel her in my heart ... one more time . He wouldn 't give me a furlough . Hell , they ... they let cons out for that kind of thing every day . All I wanted to do was say good-bye . Is that why you planted your garden ? Crazy , huh ? I keep praying maybe ... one day I 'll actually get the chance to show how much I loved her . But Michaels , he 's set on making ... a statement with this place . I guess maybe they were my statement . I just didn 't want them to think they broke me . [ Slinky Clanging ] - Hey , buddy . - [ Boy ] Hey , wait up . ! I hope you don 't mind . I brought your kids some toys . Hi , cutie . Give this to your mother . Tell her I 'll be there in a second , okay ? You have a beautiful family . - You 're a lucky man . - Thanks . Something on your mind ? Carl Will . - What about him ? - Well , I 'm a little bit embarrassed to admit this ... but I 'm not sure I can handle this execution . I know it 's what we do , but I 've never seen a man die before . I was hoping you could help me . - Well , you 're talking to the wrong man . - Yeah . I saw your face as we were doing the walk-through . It 's pretty difficult for you to imagine Carl Will strapped to that chair ... gas rising up , choking the life out of him . Why is that ? It just is , okay ? Hmm . Did you ever notice that these things are just like guilt ? You can move it from one place to another ... but it always comes back . Who are you ? Someone who doesn 't want to see an innocent man die . Someone who thinks thatJessica Will deserves to have her father ... just as much as those kids deserve to have theirs . I 've been walking the yard for 20 years . It 's all I know . It 's too late to start over , and ... I can 't afford to cross a guy like Clancy . - You 're afraid for your life . - Yeah , well , you should be too . You know how it is on the inside . Things happen . And I 'm damn sure not gonna end up like Anthony Lewis and the others . Lewis was transferred in from Joliet . Just like all the other men who died here . I pulled the inmates ' files and I tracked them . It 's really interesting . Each one of them belonged to the same Chicago crime family . My guess would be that somebody paid to have them silenced . Is that the way the operation worked ? Yeah . Clancy 's brother-in-law ... is a pencil pusher atJoliet . He made a deal with a rival family . They transferred targets into Oakfield . Clancy does the job . They split the money . Are you a part of it ? No , I wasn 't . I didn 't find out until after Anthony Lewis was killed . And by then , I was in too deep to say anything . What about Carl Will ? Clancy was finishing up on Lewis , and Will walked in . I was supposed to make sure the area was clear . Hell , I thought he was just hitting the guy up for cash . - Is that when you knocked him out ? - Yeah , well , I had to . Clancy would have killed the guy right there . Clancy planted the shiv on him . By the time Will came to ... it was over . And now he 's going to die ... for something he didn 't do . [ Broots ] There 's definitely something wrong with this game . Maybe not all the pieces are there . They 're not , they 're not , but it 's more than that . I have a feeling we 're not seeing something important with this whole thing . [ Pills Rattle ] Speak for yourself . Got us a Stetson . - [ Gun Cocks ] - Well , I hear that . Twitch and your next stop is Boot Hill . Hey , relax , little lady . I 'm just the pony express . Put the phone down and turn around ... slowly . That 's an awfully big gun for such a pretty little lady . Save it for the hoedown . What are you doing here ? Well , I told you . I was paid to make a delivery . Yes . What kind of delivery ? Hey , I 'm unarmed . I swear . Left hand only . I knew there was something missing . What are you talking about ? The game . Chance . Get out ofjail free . [ Sydney ] What do you think it means , Miss Parker ? Damn it . I need to see your registration book . [ Clerk ] Okay . [ Muttering ] [ Pages Turning ] " Jarod Short . Jarod St. James . Jarod Ventnor . Jarod Chance . Marvin Gardens . Room 5 . " The room ... The room right next to ours . [ Sydney ] " Go directly tojail . Do not pass Go . Do not collect $ 200 . ' " I am sick of being a token on his game board . Miss Parker . [ Miss Parker ] Go directly tojail . Damn you , Jarod . [ Chanting ] Free Carl Will . Free Carl Will . Hey , Clancy . The warden just called . He wants you to make another check of the gas chamber . - Make sure there 's no malfunctions . - It 's fine . I loaded the cyanide myself not an hour ago . Hey , don 't shoot the messenger . Guess there 's some kind of electrical problem . Have Larson check it . His wifejust called . He 's sick . My butt . He 's yellow . You check it . I can 't . I 'm the new guy . I have to bring Will his last supper . All right , damn it . You need something done right ... Do it yourself . Well , good thing we 're not frying this guy . [ Door Opens ] - Warden Michaels ? - [ Door Closes ] [ Clancy ] Hey , what 's going on here ? Who shut the door ? Who 's there ? Scary , isn 't it ? Being locked up like a wild animal ... waiting to die . Funny , Bradley . Now let me out . Mm . I don 't think I 'll do that . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Same thing you 've been doing . [ Clancy On Intercom ] I don 't know what you 're talking about . [ Jarod On Intercom ] Oh , come on , Clancy . I know you killed Anthony Lewis . You set up Carl Will to take the fall for it . You were going to let an innocent man die ... for something you did . [ Clucking Tongue ] Who the hell are you ? I 'm you ... judge ... - jury ... - [ Switch Clicks ] - and executioner . - [ Switch Clicks ] How many men ? How many men did you kill , Clancy ? Five ? Six ? They were animals . I did the public a favor . [ Jarod ] And you almost got away with it . Except Carl Will was at the wrong place at the wrong time . [ Clancy ] Name your price . [ Jarod ] My price ? Money . How much is a human life worth anyway ? How much did you make ? 5,000 ? 10,000 a head ? Nah , I think it 's time for justice to win this one . I 'd ask if you had a last request ... but the truth is ... you don 't really deserve it . It 's showtime . [ Beeps ] - No ! - [ Sizzles ] [ Clancy Yelling , Indistinct ] Don 't you think not telling that man ... those cyanide capsules were fake is cruel and unusual punishment ? - [ Clancy ] Bradley . ! Aah . ! - Nah . [ Clancy Screaming ] I , uh , would be happy to answer any questions you have ... but right now , I 'd like to hug my dad ... and tell him how much I love him . [ Miss Parker ] Get out of my way . [ Reporters Clamoring ] [ Miss Parker ] Hey , you , open up . We 're expected . [ Buzzer Buzzes ] No civilized person could sit here in front of you people ... and tell you that he enjoys giving the order ... to have cyanide pellets ... dropped into acid to kill someone . But we do that to deter people from committing crimes . Unfortunately , there are events that would prove we have corruption on our staff . And inspired by these events , changes will be made here ... that hopefully benefit all the inmates . My resignation will become final in 24 hours ... after my last official act as warden . [ Man ] So , we understand you like to play games , Mr ... . Parker . Yes . And I 've invented one . I call it Get Out ofJail Free . [ Mews ]

 Picture this , the Patteron 's pool , fancy speedboat ablaze , the hamster laid out on the tiny deck chair , sailing off to Valhalla . We 're not giving Wyatt 's hamster a viking funeral . - Trigger 's dead ? - We didn 't know how to tell you . How did it happen ? Give it to me straight . Loose hub on the exercise wheel . Poor little guy never knew what hit him . Oh , man . I know this is a difficult time of great loss for you but I really think if we gave him a viking funeral it would take the sting out . It 's not fair . I never even got a chance to say goodbye . Lis , is there anything you can do to help ? Consider it done . - What the ... ? - She killed us . I 'd be quick with those goodbyes . You 've got 90 seconds before extensive brain damage sets in . Tch tch tch . Something I 've always wanted to tell you , but the moment ever seemed right . So here goes . Trigger , I ... Where are you going ? I wasn 't finished . Ungrateful little weeny . Now for the fun part . - Ugh ! - Ugh ! Ooh , almost lost you there . In the future , can we have final approval before you murder us ? It gives me great pleasure to officially announce the refurbishing of Farber High 's delapidated eye-sore of a west wing into a state of the art full service library facility . Hey , Scampi ! How about a state of the art poke in the eye ? - Who the hell is that ? - I don 't know but I like her style . Filtered air continuously piped in . How would you like my foot piped into your bum ? Good one . What do you know ? A ghost . Let 's get her . Say , uh , Gary , do you remember having the uncarry supernatural ability to see ghostly appartitions before ? Now that you mention it , no . Relax will ya . Probably just a touch of deadsight . A residual effect of your jaunt to the afterlife . Aah ! She 's getting away ! It 's clammy . We 're close . - Do you fell that ? - Yeah , my neck hairs are arching . - Ooh ! - Aah ! - Aah ! Fermaldahyde ! Tacky ! Go ahead , captain ghost chaser . Ah ! Ah , I 'm scared now . Probably just some bad cheese . Aah ! - Aah ! - Aah ! Boo ! Ah ha ha ! - Aah ! - Aah ! Knock it off . You 're scaring him . Oh , the big bad Gary scared the poor little headless corpse . If you 're looking for your head it 's in the fridge . Watch the eyes . Oh , way too freaky . Sorry , didn 't mean to scare ya . But I did . Boo ! Boo , go away ! Student 's don 't belong here . Never mind , love . He 's a born rule follower , he 's a little freaky that way . Follower ? I founded this school . I made the rules you snot nosed hippie . Why do you hate me ? I love you . I love everybody . - That 's why I hate you . - Lay off , fuss pot ! Fuss pot ? At least I 'm not the moron who cut his own head off . Geez , one slip up with a band saw and everyone labels you a moron . Hey , it 's Mr Kabaysa . You 're a legend in shop class , man . If I saved even one other head from being cut off it was worth it . Why don 't you cut your tongue off . What 's the scuttle butt on our lounge ? It 's official , Scampi 's tearing it down . This is our home . Maybe we can help . I 'm a magic genie . Magic genie ? Far out . Imagine you can do all sorts of amazing things . You would , wouldn 't ya ? Who needs magic , we 've got ghosts here . Let 's get them to haunt Scampi . " To Nicole , don 't forget who gave you your first set of wheels Happy Birthday Uncle Clive . " Page 3 and up . Yee-haw ! Turning right here , get out of the way ! Boo ! Boo ! Boo ! I 'm a haunted painting . Don 't build your library or you 'll see me again , sometime , soon . Boo ! Curious , I 'll be going this way now . That was embarrasing . Come and play with us , Clive . Forever and ever and ever . - Man ! - Raincheck . Yes ! Cafeteria ! Split pea soup , it 's on every Thursday ! Whoo ! Safe , not even the most henious apparition would dare to violate the sanctity of a locked bathroom stall . - Guess again . - Aah ! Leave our lounge alone ! What do you want from me ? If the teachers lounge is destroyed , we will haunt you forever . Oh , no . Not the unholy , swirly . - Abandon your plans . - Alright you win . I promise I won 't build the new library . Whoo ! I bet you Scampi 's on the phone firing the contractors right now . You 've got to help me I 'm being haunted by murderous ghosts . Ghosts you say ? Describe the apparitions . Any exploding heads , melting flesh , eye sockets oozing maggots . Well , they did try to give me a swirly . I deal with the real violent entities . If you 've got a problem with swirly 's call your mommy . But there was a disembodied head in the toliet . Was the toliet filled with blood ? Yeah , sure , blood , brains , whatever , just get over here . I 'll be there . Mother , I 'm going out . Hey , check it out . A note from the ghosts . " Thanks for all your help . We 've left you a gift in the locker . " Trigger ! Daddy missed you . And this time I 'm not going to wait to tell you how much I- - What the hell was that ? Boys , are you alright ? Lucky my gun slinging ghost hunter vaporized the nasty spectre vermin . He killed my dead hampster . You breathers better clear out . I got a job to do . And I 'd hate to kill anything that ain 't already dead . You heard the man , he 's got a job to do , make this school as clean , as people say . Let 's rock ' n ' roll ! We 've got to get that guy before he blows our friends to kingdom come . Okay , game plan . Gary and I will go talk to Scampi and Lis , you handle to psycho raving lunatic . I don 't want to . He smells like formeldahyde trade ya . - No way . - Just go . They 're really not bad ghosts . They love this school . All they want is to keep their teachers lounge . The teachers lounge ? That 's where they live ? Yeah . So , if I were looking for the ghosts , the teachers lounge is where I might find them . Sure bet . All I said was the ghosts were in the teachers lounge stop hitting me . Excuse me , ma 'am . Could you direct me to the teachers lounge , please . Sure , just follow my zap . Ah , looky looky , a magical being . Judging from the pattern and blue color I 'd say you 're a computer genie capable of spontanious lightning magic which of course is no match for my mojo chicken bones . Creepy . You know , you should talk to the ghosts . You 'd like them . Like them ? Yes , the way they made the cafeteria a barf of pea soup particulary charming . So if there 's nothing more . I 'm afraid you leave us with no choice . My model ! My model ! Stop , my model ! You don 't have to carry around that big gun just to impress me . I like a guy with a heart . And I know somewhere beneath that hard shell and those snake tattoos you 're really just a regular guy . I like you . You want to go out for pie ? Great , let 's do pie . As soon as I terminate these ghosts . - Pick you up at 8 : 00 . - But I need pie now . Damn ! Here 's your precious model . Huh ? What ? This way Scampi and the ghosts will have to work it out . Realeasing anger is the first step to communication . Will he live to see the second step ? Anybodies guess . [ arguing ghosts ] I 'm scary , really scary ! I was only trying to build a library for the kids . [ whistling ] Cool it , what are we going to this poor man . Thank you , thank you , kind and beautiful spirit . Beautiful ? - Off with his head ! - No . Whatever happened to make love , not war ? I 'm prepared to love this man . Love is good . Give me love . Has it occured to anyone that maybe we 're the ones being selfish to this wonderfully dedicated educator . Selfish ? We 're being evicted from our home . - Hack his head off . - No , no , no ! We can work it out . Tell him , miss , uh , didn 't get your name . Petula . - Clive . - Do you believe in free love , Clive ? Free wild covered in mud love , that 's me . I know I said I would go for pie , but I have to wash my hair tonight , my dog died , my mom 's visiting , I 'm seeing somebody . We 're not letting you get through that door . Yeah , you 're not hurting our friends . - Voodoo ! - Stand firm . It can only hurt you if you believe in it . - Oh ! - Oh ! So if we build a new library in the east wing . No , no the east wing , that 's where Mr Henderson the drama coach lurks . He popped a blood vessel yelling Stella in the 62 production of street car . OK , how about the south annex them ? No good . 1935 chess team had a gas leak . Took out the whole egg headed lot of them . Fine . Is there a single spook free zone in the whole school where we can build the new library . How about over the old library ? Now there is an idea . There are no ghosts here . Tell that to my thermal guage . It knows that ghosts are very cold . Why don 't you tell us dreams to me ? Fantasy will set you free . Stop , these are friendly spirits . I 'd step aside if I were you . Don 't you dare threaten me . Your services are no longer required . That 's okay . I 'm not in it for the money . It 's more of a hobby . You don 't frighten me , you little pissant ! Go fly near and far , fly away from here . You don 't know what we can find . Why don 't you come with me on a magic carpet ride . That 's an old song . I sed to teach that in music appreciation class . - Miss Petula ? - Tommy Murdock ? Ah ! You were my favorite teacher . You turned me onto rock . From there I slipped into drugs and devil worship . I 've always wanted to thank you . Is that little Tommy ? Oh , my gosh ! Remember me boy . That 's right . Mr Kabas , Tommy , was the one who discovered my body . Yeah , yeah . I remember . That 's what pushed me over the edge . Gee , it 's great to see you guys again . So you 've not going to send them into oblivion ? No . Even through every dark thing inside me tell me to . I can 't . These ghosts were my teachers . They worked tirelessly day after day . Shaping my mind , preparing me for the road ahead . They made me the man I am today . Ah , the rich rewards of the teaching profession . Around my 8th birthday was when I discovered the wonder of putting bugs under my magnnefying glass , slugs that kind of thing . Then I discovered the power of beezabub . Do you like the pie ? Want some more ? How about you , Mom ? Captioned by Grant Brown

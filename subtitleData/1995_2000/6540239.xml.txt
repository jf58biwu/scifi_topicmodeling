 Once upon a time , there was a guy with the improbable name of Fox Mulder . He started out life happily enough , as these things go . He had parents who loved him , a cute kid sister . He had a roof over his head , got all his flu shots , had all his fingers and toes , Aside from being stuck with the name Fox , which probably taught him how to fight - or not - he pretty much led a normal life . But the worst thing by far , the biggest kick in the slats this kid Fox ever got , was what happened to his sister . One day , she just disappeared . Fox buckled down and worked his butt off , graduated top of his class at Oxford , then top of his class at the FBI Academy . None of that made up for his sister , though . It was just a way of putting her out of his mind . Finally , the way I figure it , he went out of his mind , and he 's been that way ever since . Fox Mulder pissed away a brilliant career , lost the respect of supervisors and friends , and lives life shaking his fist at the sky and muttering about conspiracies to anyone who 'll listen . He 's one step away from pushing a baby carriage filled with tin cans down the street . But now .. all that 's gonna change . Tell them the truth , you lying son of a bitch ! He 's not me , Scully ! Scully ! Scully , he 's not me ! You hate me now , right ? Dana , I 'm sorry I narked on you to Kersh , but I ... I was scared you were gonna lose your job . You did the right thing , Mulder . I did ? I 've been telling you for years you should play by the book , haven 't I ? Hey , it 's the new me . Hey ! You fellas , take ... What about these ? Come on ! Fellas ! You ain 't going nowhere . You and me have had our asses officially disappeared . Looks like we 're up fudge creek . - Who are you ? - Call sign 's " Maverick " . Not like I 'm gonna be hot-stickin ' it anytime soon . - Are you all right , ma 'am ? - " Ma 'am " ? Kiss my ass , you desk monkey . Oh ! No , no , no ! I am Tiger Woods . So ... what did Kersh say ? He said that I was willful ... insubordinate , and not a team player . And that the FBI didn 't need agents that weren 't team players . What a jerk . Then what ? - Two-week suspension without pay . - You 're not serious ! Who does he think he is ? ! See you in two weeks . Dana ? Do you suppose a home-cooked meal might ease the pain a little ? Say , my place ? 8.00 ? I think she likes me , Tiger . So there I am with this wet-behind-the-ears RIO flying back seat , and I 'm thinking " Hell , man , I 'm gonna give this cherry the ride of his life . " So I 'm putting the spurs to her , and I 'm doing a little hassling with my wing man Buzzsaw . - Now ... - Would you mind ... ? Hold up . Buzzsaw gets on my zero . He 's right on my zero . - And when he gets on your zero ... - Maverick ... - It 's like a damn dog tick . - Maverick ... You ain 't shaking that son of a gun . Hey , Grandma Top Gun ! Will you shut the hell up ? You 're my bitch now , pencil neck ! General Wegman wants to see you . Son ? You got a set on you , I 'll say that much . You had us fooled . Why didn 't you tell us what you were doin ' from the start ? - Meaning ... ? - It 's the wrong one . You replaced the flight data recorder . This one 's from ... It 's a scrapped F-111 , sir . It 's junk . You gave the FBI the wrong flight data recorder . Why ? Morry ... if you were runnin ' a scam on the FBI , why didn 't you let us in on it ? I didn 't know if I could trust you . We have a security leak , gentlemen , and for all I knew , it was one of you . That 's why I approached Agent Scully alone , to find out who her contact is . Unfortunately , her partner Agent Mulder screwed everything up . So why didn 't you tell us all this ? I knew that you wouldn 't believe it until you figured it out for yourself . - So , the real flight data recorder is safe ? - Oh , yeah , absolutely . - And you will bring it back ? - Of course . By God , you do got a set on you ! I wish I could say that about some of your colleagues . About those who proffer rumour and innuendo . - Those who make dangerous accusations . - Morris 's behaviour supported ... You can explain yourself to the review panel in Washington . I 've already wired them recommending censure for your actions . You 're lucky I didn 't throw you in the Stockade . Uh-huh . A little mood lighting for the bedroom . No bedroom ? This guy hasn 't been laid in ten years . Hey , Chris . Hey , I like the , uh ... the , uh ... the nose thing . Ouch ! As if ! Terry ! Buddy ! Hey , Terence . Sorry . How 's it goin ' ? Mom says she 's taking out a restraining order on you . - What are you doing back ? - Joanne ... - Your stuff is all outside . Get out . - There 's something I gotta tell you . I 've heard enough from you for one lifetime . Go tell it to that tramp of yours , that Scully . Dana Scully . Special Agent Dana Scully . - Special tramp Dana Scully ! - She 's my partner . - I 'm supposed to be your partner . - My name is not Morris Fletcher . It 's Fox Mulder . Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI . Dana Scully is my FBI partner . I am not your husband . We are not married . We are strangers , and I have a whole other life that I 'm trying to get back to . You know , Morris , most men , when they have a midlife crisis , they buy themselves a sports car . They don 't run around calling themselves Fox ! I want you to look out the window . Will you just look out the window with me ? You see that car down there ? See the two men in it ? They 're surveilling me . They 're spying on me . I don 't know if Morris told you , but he has a very dangerous job . Those men think I 'm him . Only , they don 't trust me . One false move and I 'm history . Which means your husband will also be history , because I won 't be able to get back and set things the way they 're supposed to be . Do you understand what I 'm saying to you ? Morris ... if you don 't like the man you 've become , I don 't blame you one bit . But this flight from reality isn 't the answer . Perfect timing . - Welcome . - Wow , Mulder . You like , huh ? Yeah , I thought it was just time I stopped living ' like a frat boy . Come on , see the rest of the place . Through there . - I didn 't even know you had a bedroom . - Oh , yeah . Yeah , gotta have someplace to lounge around , read the Sunday New York Times . - Uh , no , that 's OK . No thanks . - Seriously . Just check it out . Seriously . Ohh ! - Oh ! Uh-oh . - Whoa ! Mulder . Maybe I like to read the New York Times backwards . Do you hate it ? No , I don 't hate it . Well , all right , then . Uh , don 't go away . Let 's get it on Let 's get it on Let 's get it on Let 's get it on Tonight is the night - You know what would really be fun ? - What ? Oh , yeah . - Me first ? - You first . Feels like my first time . Now what ? - You 're not Mulder . - What ? ! Baby ... " Baby " me and you 'll be peeing through a catheter . You are Morris Fletcher . It was Mulder who was arrested in the desert . He was telling the truth about you . Now how do we get things back to normal ? How should I know ? I wouldn 't do it even if I could . You saw my wife . You think I wanna go back ? Two kids who 'd kill me in my sleep for the insurance money . A $ 400,000 mortgage on a house that just appraised at 226 . And my job . Ye gods ! You think being a Man in Black is all voodoo mind control ? - You should see the paperwork . - Are you through ? As far as I 'm concerned , this thing is a gift from heaven . No one 's ever gonna believe you , so get used to me being here . Or , I just shoot you ... baby . I 'm telling you , I have no idea how to change things back ! What about Mulder 's source , the man he was supposed to meet ? Do you know how to get in touch with him ? I don 't know anything about that . Sorry , you 're out of luck . Hello , I 'm busy entertaining . Leave a message and I 'll get back to you . I 'm trying you one last time . Are you or are you not interested in the classiÔ¨Åed information I have to give you ? Please pick up the phone if you 're there . - Mulder . - Agent Mulder , listen very carefully . Well , I guess we 've given the neighbours enough to talk about . At first you couldn 't wait to get away from me , and now you won 't leave the house . Where can we go ? - What do you mean ? - You 're right . We should get out of the house . Go someplace with a lot of people . - Someplace with a lot of people ? - Mm-hm . - In Rachel , Nevada ? - What do you say ? Let 's run through this one more time . I 'll go in there alone , like you told me to . He 'll be wearing a blue Buffalo Bills cap . And ? And if I try and slip out the back door , da-da-da , dee-dee-dee . - Get going . - Can 't we start over ? Do that thing with the handcuffs ? Maybe ... Probably not your scene . I have waited for what seems like a whole light year Just to see your face once again , my dear Shiny bright light Moonlight Sunlight , starlight With big , dark eyes that send me out of sight Now I 'm staring at ... - Expecting someone ? - No , I 'm not expecting someone . Because if you 're here expecting someone , tell me now , so I can divorce you and take the house . Joanne , have another white wine . You 're the guy ? Sit down . Well , I 'll be damned ! Whoa . Ooh ! God , that beer went right through me . I gotta ... I got ... I 'll be right back . - You sabotaged a UFO . - Keep your voice down . I didn 't intend for it to crash , Agent Mulder . I just meant to disable the stealth module so you could see it . - Scully . - Mulder ? - Is that really you ? - What are you doin ' here ? I 'm tryin ' to figure out a way to help you . - What are you , disgruntled ? - You make me sound like some postal clerk . What you came for is on the floor by your feet . Morris ? In my memory , you are moonlight Starlight With big , dark eyes that send me out of sight Now I 'm starin ' at the stars Wonderin ' where you are Wonderin ' if I 'll ever see your face again Now I 'm starin ' at the stars Wonderin ' where you are ... Joanne ? Hey , how 's it goin ' ? - Listen , have you seen Morry ? - You bet I 've seen him . Hey , hey ! Whoa , whoa ! Guys ! Guys ! - What the hell was that , Morry ? - I guess I make a lousy husband . Listen , I 'll talk to her . So you 're the guy that wants my life . I assume that includes all the ass-kickings ? - Oh , no . You don 't wanna do this ! - Yeah , I do . - Jeff 's outside ! - So what ? If he sees us together , we 're both dead ! Especially when he sees this . Take that to Scully . You must have some sort of waxy build-up . I said Jeffs here ! No way am I going out there until he leaves . You sneak it past him . - You 're his buddy . - His buddy ? He doesn 't trust me as far as he could throw me ! Oh , jeez . - Hey . - Hey . - Jeff . - General Wegman . You men , come with me . - Sir ? What are we , uh ... - There . Detain that man . Morris ! Stop ! Hey , guys . - What 's in the bag , Morris ? - It 's , uh ... beer . - You sure it 's not a flight data recorder ? - No , it 's beer . Suckers . Mmm . More huevos rancheros . - Mas huevos rancheros . - For favor . Open up ! I should have made more salsa . - We need your help . - Who crashed ? Who , what , why . We need to know everything that 's on that data recorder . It 's similar in size and shape to the FDRs on the SR-71 . That 's definitely not standard issue . - Where did you get this ? - Groom Lake . Outside Area 51 . - Dreamland . - The Aurora spy plane . - What 's that ? - Black world . A Skunk Works special . Aurora is a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft fueled with slush hydrogen . Or methylcyclohexane . - What 's with him ? - You guys like the name ? I wanted to go with either " Aurora " or " Borealis " . - What the hell 's he talkin ' about ? - Mulder ? - He 's not Mulder . - Huh ? We think the crash of this particular aircraft , whatever it was , resulted in a , uh ... My name is Morris Fletcher . I work inside Area 51 . I assumed Mulder 's identity through a warp in the space-time continuum . Trust me , little man , I ain 't him . I love you guys . I really do . You 're the Lone Gunmen , aren 't ya ? You guys are my heroes . Look at this crap you print . - We uncover the truth . - The truth ? That 's what 's great about you monkeys . Not only do you believe this horse pucky we create , you broadcast it as well . Look at this . There is no Saddam Hussein ! He 's John Gillnitz . We found him doing dinner theater in Tulsa . He did a mean King and I. Plays good ethnics . You 're saying Hussein 's a government plant ? I 'm saying I invented the guy . We set him up in ' 79 . He rattles his sabre whenever we need a good distraction . If you boys only knew how many of your stories I dreamed up sitting on the pot . - What stories ? - Oh , I 'm sorry , Melvin . That 's classified . Name 's Frohike . What the hell did you do with Mulder ? Shut up , all of you . If you guys want Mulder back , get me these results . Wow . - Who is it ? - Morris Fletcher . Come in . We shouldn 't be seen together . Not after last night . - Fletcher , Mulder , whoever you are . - I 'm hoping this will be our last meeting . Agent Scully 's flying back with the analysis of that flight data recorder . It 'll be too late to save me . Now that Morris knows you 're the leak . Once you get back - if you get back - he 'll have me arrested , disappeared . Even if he doesn 't , his colleagues will figure out soon enough . - I sabotaged that craft . - Why 'd you do it ? I didn 't mean for it to crash . I just wanted you to see it . Well , why ? There comes a time when you look back instead of forward . See the sum of your life . My career has been spent hiding the truth from the people , destroying , in a way , that which was most precious to me . What is the truth ? - You mean ... you don 't know ? - Don 't know what ? The truth . What is going on here at Area 51 ? What are these black-budget projects ? We fly these birds . They don 't say what makes ' em go . They engineer ' em all up in Utah . If you don 't know , why 'd you call me ? Why ... I 've seen your file . You 've chased flying saucers for years . Do aliens really exist , Agent Mulder ? - Something 's comin ' up . - Got it . - What is it ? - We broke the encryption . This records the telemetry of 28 systems , including airspeed and fuselage torque . Yeah , all the usual readouts , but , uh ... what are these ? " Tachyon flux . Gravitational displacement . " Aurora , my ass . What have you guys been flying out there ? I want you guys to analyze that data . Morris . - This is one of mine . - Get your butt in gear . - You 're gonna miss me . - Fat chance ! - Back off , Sneezy . - Enough ! Call me when you guys have some answers . Far-out ! - The black mailbox ! - Dude , that 's a white mailbox . No , they painted it white to hide it . This is the black mailbox . The best place to see Freedom Mountain and the UFOs over Dreamland , man . I know a guy who saw five in one night . He said they danced in the sky . You guys hear that ? What the hell ... ? ! Cool ! Did you guys see that ? You don 't look too happy . Don 't tell me I 'm gonna have to put two kids through school . That is you in there , Mulder , isn 't it ? I , uh ... I just got off the phone with Frohike . They were able to download and analyze the crash data , and yes , there was an anomalous event that night . - And how do I get back ? - Well , that 's just it . It 's all about random moments in time , about a series of variables approaching an event horizon . And even if we could recreate that moment , if we could sabotage another craft ... Mulder , if we were ... if we were off ... If the event were off by even one millisecond ... I might wind up with my head in a rock . Something like that , yeah . What about him ? I mean , me . Whatever . Whoever he is . Agent Mulder has become AD Kersh 's new golden boy . He 's been tasked with returning the flight data recorder that he and I stole . The son of a bitch confesses to Kersh even more than I do to my priest . - I 'm just tagging along for the ride . - What do you mean , just tagging along ? I 'm out of the Bureau . I 've been censured and relieved of my position . No . You can explain it to them like you explained it to me . You have the data . You can make them understand . You can get your job back . I 'd kiss you if you weren 't so damn ugly . Take a picture . It 'll last longer . If I ... shoot him , is that murder or suicide ? Neither , if I do it first . Hey , Scully ? Stop ! Stop , stop , stop , stop , stop ! You gotta help me ! You gotta help me ! Open the window , please . I need to talk to you . Please , I need somebody to help me . This thing ... it was like a ... like a wave . Like ... like , all squiggly and everything . And ... and their faces , they ... they stuck together . And ... and her arm , it was coming through his chest ! Sam , man . Where you been ? Who 's the dude ? I swear , man . They were messed up . I believe you . So the motel guy wants cash . He won 't take a credit card . So then it hits me . I flash him my badge : " Fox Mulder , FBI " . I tell him we 're investigating crappy motels in the Southwest , so he 'd better watch his behind . The guy gives me the room for free and he throws in a six-pack of brews to boot . I love this job ! Listen , Dana , after we return this flight recorder , what do you say I have a word with the big man ? See if I can get you your job back ? We could have lots of fun together once you got to know me . - You know that ? - I 've still got my gun . All right already . Wait a second . Hold on . - Back up . - What is it ? Back up ! Can I help you , ma 'am ? I don 't understand . This place was burned to the ground . I don 't think so . Yeah . This place , two nights ago . I think I 'd remember that . What 's going on ? - What are you doin ' here ? - I need to talk to you . Something 's happened . Morris , don 't forget your stupid chair ! You and it should be very happy together ! Terence , get back inside . You got a lot of gall coming here ! I told you . I 'm not your husband . This man is . You come here to watch my family fall apart ? You getting a big kick out of that ? ! I have to talk to you alone . Home wrecker ! - Careful . You 're gonna bust a lung . - Leave me alone ! Joanne ... What he said about me being your husband ... it 's true . Get the hell off my porch ! We got married on June 13 , 1978 . It rained that day . You got mad at the reception cos I said I couldn 't see the cake behind your fat ass . You remember our first apartment ? That dump in Pentagon City ? You 'd turn the air conditioner on , lights would go out ? Or when you were pregnant , how I 'd tickle your kneecaps to make you laugh ? Remember ? Remember the night Chrissy was born ? And I held her in my arms , all red-faced and screaming ? That 's the only time I ever saw you cry . Oh , my God . Morris ? Is that you ? Let 's go . What do you mean , go ? Where are you taking him ? We have reason to believe that whatever event caused this may be reversing . We gotta get back to the spot where this all began . It may be our only chance . Sorry , Morris . A traitor 's a traitor . - This isn 't what it looks like . - Got it ! Sir . - What are you doin ' ? - Cleaning up . - What are you talkin ' about ? - I put McDonough and Mrs Chee back where they belong . Now it 's their turn . The warp is snapping back like a rubber band . Only , we have to be in its path when it happens . Why are you doin ' this ? Till now I had a spotless career record . I want that back . So this is time snapping back ? It 'll be like the last few days never happened . You won 't remember any of this . Well , in that case , Dana , it 's been real . Come on , Mulder . Let 's go . - Mulder . - It 's me . I just wanted to let you know that we slipped under Kersh 's radar . Our little field trip to Nevada went unnoticed . - Oh , yeah ? - Mulder ... I 'm sorry that your confidential source didn 't pan out . You were right . Just another crackpot who watches too much Star Trek . - Good night . - Hey , Scully ? I , uh , know it 's not your normal life , but thanks for coming out there with me . You 're welcome . I made this !

You know , if I could solve This whole metastable compound business , I could save the college . You know , a new energy source Would be worth a fortune . You better hurry up .

Outside of the ivy league , name me one private college Or university that isn 't in financial trouble . Oh , all right . Name another . You don 't think it 's too much ? No . It 's elegant . And it 's a wonderful idea To go with the big wedding This time . It does put the pressure On the professor to show up . If he forgets this time , that 's it . Well , in his case , once is justifiable , And twice is ... Understandable , but 3 times ... [ high-pitched honk ] Coming through . Thank you . [ honk honk ] Morning . Or afternoon . Whatever the case may be . We have a lot to talk about today , So let 's get into it without delay . Oh . Oh , uh , thank you , Whoever gave me the plate of fruit and the ... Dead pheasant . This does not count as extra credit . Last time , we were talking about newton 's law of gravitation . To review , you see , this " g " is like the " c " in e = mc-squared . It 's a constant- - it 's a constant universe- - As much as anything is constant in the universe . It 's saying that the force of attraction between 2 bodies Is in direct proportion to the product of their masses And in inverse proportion To the square of the distance between them . An example would be- - let 's make a naked man m1 , Naked lady m2 . Now , according to this formula , their attractive forces Would want to close the distance to zero . Why don 't they ? Hmm ? The earth ! Ah . So ... In essence , that is gravity , And this ... Is dr . Richards life drawing . It 's not my class , is it ? Philip ! Over here ! Sara ! Ooh . Very sorry . Its own momentum .

Ah , I was just gonna , you know , grade my lunch , Eat a few tests , and hope for the best . How do you hold it in ? Well , like everybody else , ruthie . I just cross my legs real tight . No , I was talking about your excitement . Excitement ? The wedding . Congratulations . No . The wedding ! Sara and I. Oh , the wedding . Oh , I 'm looking forward to it . Aren 't you , honey ? It 's today . Are you sure ? The wedding is today , ok ? Mmm . I believe you . 6 : 30 . Mm-hmm . At the presbyterian church on beech street . I 've been there . We had our rehearsal there last night . That 's right . We did . It went well ? Yes , it did . Good . But it doesn 't count . No ? The wedding counts , And I want you to promise me on everything between us That you 'll be there , ok ? I 'd rather die than disappoint you . Well ... This is going to be the very last time I try to marry you . I imagine so . I know that I love you , But ... I 'm not sure that you can love me . That 's ridiculous . I love you with all my heart , With every cell , with every molecule , With every atom . I love you on the subatomic level . Hmm . Prove it to me tonight at 6 : 30 . Prove what , honey ?

Hey , are you still working on that lighter-than-air compound ? It 's a ... Propulsive polymer . And I don 't mean to be rude , wilson , But I have to go . Don 't seem too happy to see me , phil . I 'm not . Well ... Ah , all the years we 've known each other , Studying , working together . What happened between us , phil ? Well , I just got tired Of you stealing my ideas , wilson . [ laughs ] and what would you have done with them ? You would have misplaced them , Forgotten them , lost them . There 's no doubt you 're the brighter of the two of us . You have a genius for science , I grant you that . It 's just the science of daily life that eludes you . I 've heard that cup of psych before . Excuse me . That 's very volatile . I won 't deny that I hate you for your brilliance . I 'm petty , corrupt ... Probably would have gone mad Trying to compete with you in pure thought , But , uh , I 'm not an innovator like you , phil . I 'm an adapter . And to that end , I have profited from your ideas . Why are you here ? Got to be honest . I 'm here this weekend to steal your fiancée And make her my wife . Well , I think you 'll be sadly disappointed . I 'll see you at the wedding then .

Watch your gown . I 've got it . Thank you . [ sniffs ] [ soft chuckle ] Philip , muffled : It 's perfectly safe , weebo . It 's just an ordinary radioactive isotope ... [ filtered breath ] That weber is now removing from the lead containment unit . [ squawks ] Very good , weber . [ squawks ] Now , you place the radioactive isotope Carefully behind the sliding shutter . See , the sliding shutter works just like a camera . It regulates the flow of gamma radiation . Instead of billions of random particles , You have a precise stream of atoms . We carefully ... Place the sliding-shutter mechanism ... Underneath the flubber . And I 'm burning up in here . Weebo ... The gamma radiation triggers a metastable decay In the flubber itself , why ? Which releases enormous quantities of energy , And that 's what propels the flubber . Now , doing it this way , I believe , is a lot more scientific Than dropping it or kicking it Or bombarding it with light-bulb photon flashes . Absolutely . I believe ... By controlling the gamma radiation flux , We can control the movement of the flubber itself . Cross your fingers , weebo . Here 's hoping . Weebo : Good luck .

For the third time , You left me standing at the altar . I 'm sorry with all my heart . But please listen to me , sara . Please . You know me . You know how sometimes I can get really fixated on an idea ? I don 't wanna hear it . Sara , you 've gotta hear it . Sara . This is the reason I didn 't make it last night . It 's flubber . Flubber . It 's a metastable compound , sara . In layman 's terms , If you apply a small amount of energy ... Flubber : Whoo ! Wow ! Then it liberates An enormous quantity of energy . But the total effect is transient , sara . The moment you stop applying energy , It returns to a quasiplasmoid state . Isn 't it remarkable , sara ? What 's remarkable , philip , Is that I ever fell in love with you . You broke my heart ... So that you could stay home and make some green goo . Sara , it 's much more than that . Flubber could save this college . Let me demonstrate . No . No . Just give me one minute , ok ? The flubber is placed in my back pocket . When I exit this window , I will fall to the ground . When I hit the ground , The flubber will send me right back up unharmed . Watch . Ta-ta , my love . Are you nuts ? I 'll be right back . Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo ! Philip ! Ahh ... [ flubber laughs ] Ouch . Philip . Are you hurt ? Just my pride . Well , if you think that you are going to get my sympathy , You are wasting your time ! [ clunk ] ooh ! We are finished !

The only reason I loaned this jerkneck college money Was so he could get straight as And go to harvard business school . This isn 't supposed to happen . Well , yes , sir .

Hello , dale . Oh , hello , professor brainard . May I see your sole ? I mean the bottom of your shoe . Oh . Oh . Game 's not over yet . Keep your chin up and your potential energy high . 'cause you know why , dale ? Get the ball , jump with all your soul . But I 'm on this end , sir . Jump , or I 'll flunk you . What ? You heard me . Jump , or I 'll flunk you out of my department . For good . Ok . I think that 's a little harsh ... Jump ! Announcer : The medfield squirrels Are trying to complete this astonishing comeback . Be patient , rutland . Plenty of time , baby . Rutland has the lead with the clock winding down . These rodents have fought their little hearts out tonight , But it looks like the squirrels Are gonna come up a couple of nuts short of a bushel . Playing keep away are the rangers . Here 's a wide open " j " by hatch . Jump , dale ! Jump ! Announcer : Jepner soaring into the air . He makes the steal . Look at him go ! Jepner with wings on his shoes Soaring to the other end . He soars . He dives . And medfield upsets rutland On an incredible play by dale jepner . And the squirrels are going nuts . We won ! We did it ! We did it ! Foul ! Since when is it within the rules For a player to accompany the ball through the hoop ? Oh , I don 't know . Come on , I 'll buy you dinner . Sara ? Good night , philip . Good night . Brainard had something to do with this . It 's the same stuff we saw the other night Over at his house . Right . I don 't know how , but I 'm absolutely certain That your team cheated . You 're just being a sore loser . Sara ? May I speak to you for a moment ? Alone ? What you have to say to her You can say to both of us . If you can remember . Sara ... Flubber . Flubber ? Sounds like baby shampoo . Flubber . It 's what won the game . That amazing aerial ballet ? Because I flubberized the boys ' shoes . A little on the bottom ... You 're remarkable . Sara ? Good night , philip . Watch yourself . Now , what do we have to do To get you to take a hint ? It 's over , philip . You lost . Go home . Play with your rubber . What kind of car does that brainard fellow drive ? Old t-bird . Why ? I just saw it . So ? It was flying . You heard me . Flying . Weebo : Hey , who won ? We did . Um , professor ? Why the long face ? I think you know why . Would it be ... A sara issue ? Wish I understood human beings . Wish I understood women . Wish I understood emotions and passions . Wish I understood any of that . If I did , I wouldn 't have had to spend my entire life In a laboratory trying to figure out How the world works . I would have been out in the world Trying to figure out why it works . I know I love her , weebo . Every neuron in my limbic system Is saturated with phenylethamine . That triggers euphoria , elation , exhilaration . Truth is , weebo ... I 'm not absent minded because I 'm selfish , crazy , or ... Or inconsiderate . I 'm absent minded because I 'm in love with sara . Professor ... That doesn 't matter anymore ... 'cause I don 't get any more chances with her . Now , that 's not true . There 's always another chance . I mean , you never know , right ? Probably just as well that it 's over . She has to move on . I 'm not right for her . But you knew that , didn 't you , weebo ?

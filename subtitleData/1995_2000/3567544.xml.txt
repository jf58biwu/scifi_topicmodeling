 [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Whistling ] Cutting out a little early today , Sydney ? Jarod ! [ Wheel Squeaking ] [ Whispering ] My God , Jarod . They 're gonna see you . Something bad is happening , Sydney . There isn 't much time left . - Jarod , let 's get out of here . - I need answers . - Answers ? - Who I am . Where I came from . Who my parents are . Just give me something , even if it 's just a name . - But I need to know now . - So do I. - [ Sydney ] Jarod . - Me too . [ Sydney ] I don 't understand . [ Man ] They deserve answers , Sydney . Jacob . I don 't understand , Jacob . It 's complicated . Please , Sydney . I don 't have much time . [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Phone Ringing ] Good morning , Broots . Sorry to interrupt . Let me guess . Jarod ? Yep . [ Clears Throat ] It just arrived this morning . He bought it from some place called the Astro Arcade in Indianapolis . - He was working in a pinball parlor ? - No , he was just hanging out . The owner said he played this exact game for almost 24 hours straight on one single quarter . - Impressive . - Oh , yeah . And what 's Sydney 's take on Game Boy ? Oh , Sydney . He left you this e-mail . " Our suffocated friend is awake . " - He 's awake . - Jacob is a threat to Centre interests . Make sureJacob never wakes up again . " I 'll be away fishing . " Find out where Sydney is . [ Laughs ] 31.48 . This boy is fast . He 's still more than a full second off the track record . Took you five years to find this kind of speed , R.J. This guy hasn 't even unpacked his bags yet . - What 'd he say his last name was ? - Jones . Well , he drives like Parnelli . That 's for damn sure . Let 's go . [ Announcer ] That 's the MCI car coming in from the pit row apron . Practice is now open for the next hour . [ Chattering ] - That was incredible ! - Thank you . - You are some driver . - Excuse me . One hell of a sequence . I could have gone faster , but my foot slipped off the gas pedal during turn four . So , hot shot , where 'd you learn to drive a race car ? - Indianapolis . - Really ? The Brickyard ? The Astro Arcade . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours , and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . [ Man ] Jarod , this is Nigel Brinkman , our number one driver . - [ Nigel ] Welcome to the big show , Jarod . - Nice to be here . Jarod 's gonna be taking over the number three car forJimmy . He had an accident in Milwaukee , didn 't he ? My son broke his leg . Doctors say it 'll be at least a year until he drives again . But he will . Know why ? He 's a Roemer . Jimmy got a little carried away with himself . He took R.J. ' s car out to scuff the tires , ended up putting it into the wall . I can understand why R.J. would be a little defensive . My sons can handle it . That 's racing . Come on . Let 's get you settled in . [ Roemer ] I accept nothing but the best from my drivers , Jarod . I can see that . This one 's an oldie . Guess you could say that knife was R.J. ' s first trophy . Here he is getting his Indy Lights Championship . There he is winning the National Quarter Midget . There he is finishing second at Long Beach . I 'm not sure why that one 's even up there . I would 've won that race if the car had been set up right . Really ? I don 't remember our chief mechanic driving the car that day . Hawkes is a dinosaur . R.J. , visiting hours at the hospital are over - - Oh , sorry . I didn 't realize you were having - - It 's okay , darling . Come on in . Uh , I think I 've gotta go check the telemetry readings on , uh , practice . [ Woman ] You 're not going to seeJimmy ? Well , I 'll try , okay ? Anna , this is Jarod Jones . He 's taking overJimmy 's ride . - Anna 's my daughter-in-law . - Hi . - Pleasure . - She 'll get your race paperwork started ... and we tire test at 1 : 00 . Well , this is uncomfortable . It 's racing . I heard about your husband 's accident . - I hope he will be all right . - Thanks . Doctors say it 's too soon to tell if the leg damage is , uh , permanent . You 're gonna need to fill out a background information form . - Background information ? - So the media and sponsors know who you are . I 'm not really interested in publicity . In this business , you will answer more questions and eat more cocktail weenies ... than you ever thought possible . I 'm sure that everything is going to work out . It looks like your family 's very close . Looks that way , doesn 't it ? [ Announcer , Indistinct ] Anything yet ? [ Clears Throat ] Well , I 've gone over Sydney 's message a dozen times ... and the best I can come up with is he 's gone to Whitecloud . - Where ? - Sydney has a cabin near Whitecloud Lake . He goes there to fish sometimes . Sydney and trout . Boggles the mind . Do you know where it is ? - Uh , yeah . - Write down the directions . I still don 't get the part about " Our suffocated friend is awake . " The directions , Broots . [ Snapping Continues ] Uh - The last word is " Whitecloud . " You don 't have to draw me a map . You both drive for the same team but you race against each other ? Not exactly . R.J. here is what you might call my support team . I don 't understand . That 's because Ringo here is a little confused ... which might come from smelling my exhaust fumes for most of the race . - Ow ! - Oh , sorry . It - - It got away from me . - You didn 't sign me this morning . - I was in your pit earlier . - Oh . Oh , yes . - Are you a driver too ? - [ Giggles ] Yeah . Now , when you talk about the life-and-death aspect of racing ... you cut right to the heart of the driver 's very existence . Really ? - [ Chattering ] - Did you want something ? Yes . I don 't have a big car yet , and I was wondering if you could give me a lift . - I need to visit someone . - Yeah , all right . [ R.J. ] This is the hospitalJimmy 's in . I thought I should meet the man I was subbing for . You want to join me ? It must be difficult working so hard ... and never getting the support you need to win . Oh , I 'll win . I have to . What was Jimmy doing in your car the day it crashed ? You saw the pathetic data on the three car . Jimmy wanted to drive a competitive ride . I felt sorry for him , gave him a shot . - End of story . - According to the data after the crash ... Jimmy had the throttle wide open when he hit the wall . Well , I love my brother , but he doesn 't know his limits . [ Woman ] Your brother has a very rare disease . In Jacob 's case , it has stimulated the brain . Seems like it 's reawakened an area injured years earlier . - Is he aware of his surroundings ? - On and off . His motor skills are very elementary ... and his speech appears to be limited to single-word utterances . I would like to see him now . Well , before you do , there 's something else you should know about your brother 's condition . [ Muttering In French ] [ Continues In French ] Jacob ? Can you hear me ? This is Sydney . [ Speaking French ] Greta . [ Softly ] Yes . He seems to be drifting from one thought to another . I 'm not sure who this Greta woman is . Greta was our mother 's name . Jacob , listen to this carefully . Do you know what year it is ? 1942 . I 'd like to take him with me . Mr. Raines . We 've completed the trace of Sydney 's telephone tap . You were right . His brother is still alive . But you 'll take care of that , won 't you ? My pleasure . Is the sun too hot ? No , I 'm fine . Doctors say you can start rehab in another month . I 'd start today if I had my way . That 's my little brother . Doesn 't know a good thing when he 's sittin 'on it . - Where you been , stranger ? - I got better things to do than hang around with gimps . - Yeah . What 's her name ? - Guilty . - Anna . - I thought you weren 't coming . You gotta have faith in your family . Can you get my baseball cap out of my room ? I am gettin ' a little toasted out here . Yeah , sure . Hey . Here . But don 't be eatin ' too many candy bars , or you 'll be drivin ' NASCAR next season . - Hey . Jimmy Roemer . - Jarod Jones . Jarod is driving the number three car . Well , good for you . Win one for the home team , huh ? I 'm just keeping your place warm until you get back . - How are you feeling ? - Well , like a Reynard with a flat tire . Just take it slow . It 'll all come back to you . I feel pretty stupid parking R.J. ' s ride into the wall . I mean , I know I blacked out , but I swear I was braking ' . The engine just kept revvin' after I made contact . Hey , accidents happen . Remember my prom night ? [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ] - Dad was P.O. ' ed , huh ? I wrapped my Mach One around a telephone pole . Course , it didn 't cost a hundred grand to have it fixed . - Here . Fill me up , will ya ? - [ Glass Shatters ] Whoa - - You okay ? - Yeah . Hard to believe I drive a race car , huh ? Like you say , accidents happen . [ Sydney ] I 'm taking you out ofhere , Jacob . To the cabin at Whitecloud . You used to love going to Whitecloud . Remember ? [ Tires Screeching ] Go that way . I 'll check the stairs . Okay , drop the mop . [ Sydney ] He can 't understand you . - Hey , Jarod . - Hey , Mario . - Nice run . Nice run . - Thanks . I was watching you . Just a little tip . Goin ' into turn one , just keep it down a little lower . Stay below the bumps . I think you 're gonna like it . - I 'll remember that . Thanks . - Take care . Seventeen races , six months without a podium finish . This , gentlemen , is unacceptable ... and that is why we are now going to begin to race as a team . - Meaning ? - Meaning you 're gonna do whatever it takes ... to get the number one car out front and keep it there . - What about me ? - Me , me , me . There is no me . It 's a team sport now . I want you and Jarod to let Nigel draft behind your cars . Block out the leader so he can gain track position , okay ? Excuse me . Blocking is a flaggable offense . - It 's called racing . - Yeah , so basicallyJarod and I are just traffic cops . Do you have any idea how much money it takes to support three cars ? - Come on , Dad . I just meant - - Sponsors want to see their product in victory lane . Otherwise , they find another team ... and you go back to crushing junk with monster trucks . Which means driving smart , not like that loose cannon little brother of yours . - You son of a bitch ! - Hey , hey ! R.J. ! Cool down . Come on . Hawkes is right . Jimmy had no business being in the number two car and you know it . Yeah ? Check the recent lap times . I should be top ride . Yeah , right . Come on , Hawkes . Let me show you something . Someone should shut that son of a bitch up for good . You see ? That 's the kind of Roemer spirit that I 'm looking for . I 'd just like to see some of it on the track . So much for the home team . Sydney ? Sydney ? [ Gasps ] Oh , God ! You scared the hell out of me . Expecting to find two corpses , Miss Parker ? - What did Raines promise you ? - What are you talking about ? The Sweeper team that showed up at the hospital . You called Raines up , didn 't you ? Admit it ! Let go of me , Sydney ! You are the only one who knows my brother is still alive . Raines thinks I murdered Jacob . If he knew he was still alive , then I would be in more danger than anyone . I suggest you check your home phone for bugs ... and let go of me . - Has he said anything ? - I need to reach him , Parker . - I need answers . - Answers ? About what I 've done . You did brake , Jimmy , but your engine kept running . [ Anna ] Jimmy used to walk the stands before every race . Said it felt like bein ' in church . Thanks for gettin ' R.J. to go seeJimmy . It perks him up when he sees his brother . - Well , I thought it might help . - Yeah . How 's he doing ? The truth is he feels like he failed . - Failed ? - Me , R.J. , mostly his dad . Well , Grant is pretty intense . Yeah , and he 's always encouraged them to compete against each other . The winter when Jimmy was seven , Grant took him and R.J. out to a cabin ... made them each chop a cord of wood ... told them the winner would get a brand-new Odekirk fishing knife ... the kind with all the attachments . - I saw the photograph in the trailer . - Right . Now , there 's no way a couple of kids can cut all that wood . And Grant knew that , but he left them out there alone in the cold . - What happened ? - There 's a lumberyard nearby . So R.J. hot-wires a tractor , rides up the hill ... buys himself a fresh-cut stack of wood ... and wins the knife . Sounds like the real prize was winning his father 's approval . And he would do anything to get it . Some things never change . Sydney ? Sydney ? - Catherine . - You remember my mother ? Look just like her . Yes . But do you remember her ? Jacob ? Please , Jacob , try to remember . - Why can 't you remember ? - [ Sydney ] Because he 's dying . The same virus that 's reawakened Jacob ... is also killing him . He has less than 12 hours left . I 'm sorry , Sydney . What can we do ? Broots is bringing some of my personal items : photos , home movies . If only I can helpJacob remember ... maybe he can tell us something about your mother . Or aboutJarod . [ Sobbing ] Or maybe he can simply die ... knowing who he is . [ Sobbing Continues ] It 's okay . [ Jarod ] Not that an Andretti needs racing advice , Michael ... but stay low , avoid the bumps , you 'll be glad you did . Something about that advice sounds kinda familiar . But thanks . [ Announcer , Indistinct ] What 's that ? I came across this throttle cable from Jimmy 's crashed engine . What , you 're a cart inspector now ? I just want to know how things work . - I couldn 't figure out what these scratches were . - Jimmy bent the cable plate . What happens when the cable plate is bent ? You bend the cable plate , and your throttle will stick . - Is that what happened toJimmy ? - I did the car inspection after the accident . Jimmy 's crash had nothing to do with mechanical error . - Well , then how do you explain these marks ? - Damaged in the crash . Well , I 'm not a mechanic , but these markings look like they were made by pliers . You 're right . You 're not a mechanic . Oh , wow . ! This place is really nice . ! Hey . Here . Hey , think I can rent it from you some weekend and bring my daughter here ? - Is this it ? - Yeah , that 's everything . You can leave now . Okay . Can - Can I at least go to the bathroom first ? Is it through here ? - [ Miss Parker ] Broots , wait . - [ Gasps ] What 's going on ? My brotherJacob is quite ill . You breathe a word of this to anybody ... and every dairy case in America will be plastered with your face . - Got it ? - Yeah . Go back to the Centre . If you notice anything unusual , you call me . We need protection for at least another 10 hours . Understood ? Yeah , as good as I 'm ever gonna . Why would you want to kill your own brother , R.J. ? [ Broots ] Yeah , I just got back . No , it 's quiet . Everything seems to be really cool . Of course I won 't say anything . Miss Parker , could you do me a favor ? Could you ... wish Sydney good luck ? Miss Parker ? Hello ? God , I hate it when she does that . Oh , Mr. Raines . - Damn it ! - [ Chuckles ] I 'm sorry about that , man . Hey ! Something eating at you , R.J. ? Now I 'm gonna have to do some major body work . You wouldn 't happen to have a small screwdriver or a set of pliers , would you ? Somebody broke the lock on the garage door and stole all the pliers last night . Really ? Can 't trust anybody these days . - Hey , Jones , try this . - An Odekirk . These are very difficult to come by . Where did you get this ? I won it . About a year ago . From whom ? From me . Don 't you just hate a sore loser , eh ? [ Laughs ] Did R.J. threaten to take your number one car , Brinkman ? [ Sydney ] Remember those tennis matches at Yale ? I still think you let me win so that I wouldn 't feel too bad . Jacob , listen to me . There are things you know , Jacob . Things that can help others . RememberJarod ? You signed him into the Centre the night he was brought there . Parker and I found files in SL 27 . Your signature was on Jarod 's entrance report . Think back . Where did he come from ? What was his real name ? His parents ' name ? That is the least I can do for him . Since your car accident , I 've done things , Jacob - unspeakable things - to protectJarod , to protect you . I even tried to kill Dr. Raines . But the bullet hit his oxygen tank and - [ Engine Roaring ] It 's pretty nifty , huh ? I rebuiltJimmy 's engine from the crash . All by myself . I did , however , have to replace this damaged throttle cable . Now , maybe I should be a cart inspector . What do you want ? Do you remember these markings ? As it turns out , they were indeed made by a pair of pliers . Pliers from an Odekirk knife . This Odekirk knife . Now , it used to belong to R.J. , but R.J. lost it in a bet to Nigel Brinkman . - What 's this got to do with me ? - I 'm glad you asked . This is a videotape ... from the surveillance cameras in the garages in Milwaukee . It 's dated the day beforeJimmy 's crash . It shows you letting Nigel Brinkman into the number two car garage . Brinkman was worried that R.J. was going to take over the number one car . How was he supposed to know thatJimmy was going to be behind the wheel that day ? Now , why would I want to hurt R.J. ? Because he wanted you replaced as crew boss . I found résumés . Résumés of people applying for your job . Oh , God . I 'm 56 years old . I can 't start over again . Now , I never wanted to hurtJimmy . What the heck was that kid doin ' in that car anyway ? He was covering for me . - Your hand . - Yeah . I started having spasms about six months ago . The day of the race it was so bad , I could barely hold the wheel . I asked Jimmy to cover for me . I 've seen cases like yours . It 's treatable . I 'll take care of it later . It 's time to think ofJimmy . I messed up , Jarod . I let down my father . I almost killed my little brother . You didn 't know that Brinkman messed with the engine . Well , I know now . I 'm gonna do everything I can to make it right . We all will . [ Raines ] No , don 't lie to me . [ Broots ] I tell you . I don 't know anybody named Jacob . Six hours , Mr. Broots . Is all this discomfort worth protecting someone like Sydney ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . Well , then maybe I can help jog your memory . [ Broots ] Oh . ! Okay . ! I think I 'm starting to remember . ! Hello , Anna . It 's Jarod . Do you think Jimmy would be up to coming to the track tomorrow ? Nigel , it 's Jarod . Hawkes thinks he made a breakthrough on your setup . Can you do a little testing in the morning ? Great . I 'll see you then . And I 'm telling you , I don 't have enough coverage in the pits . - Yeah . - Excuse me , sir . - Yeah . - Could you direct me to the public address feed ? There 's a rack in the back . That 's what the problem is . You 've only got five cameras out there , and I need twice that many . [ Beeps ] Well , why don 't you look on the camera truck ? Television . I had to be out of my mind . [ Chuckles ] Look , can we at least get the on-camera positions set ? [ Announcer ] Only one and a half seconds separate the two cars - [ Continues , Indistinct ] Nigel . Glad you could make it . Hey , if you boys think you can get some more speed out of this car , I 'm ready . - Where 's Grant ? - Well , considering the tone of our last meeting ... Hawkes and I thought it would be wiser if we kept this between us until we see if it pans out . - Okay . Let 's give it a run . - There you go . [ Chattering , Shouting ] [ Man ] All right , if you got problems , just step on it a few times . All right , Nigel . Have a good one . ! Ready , set , go . ! Go . ! - How does she feel ? - So far , so good . - [ Beeps ] - I 'll get her warmed up . Then we 'll see what she can do . [ Man ] Those rods workin 'all right ? What the hell is Brinkman doing out there ? You should watch this . Then we have to talk . [ Crew Chattering ] Here 's your helmet , Jarod . Go ! Go ! I 'm gonna open her up the next time around . [ Jarod ] How 's it feel , Nigel ? [ Nigel On Speaker ] Oh , man . It doesn 't get any better than this . [ Jarod ] Come on , Nigel . You can go faster than that . Jarod , what are you doing out here ? Just trying to find out what really happened toJimmy 's car before the crash . [ Nigel On Speaker ] I don 't know what you 're talking about . [ Jarod ] Lies . That 's what I 'm talking about . I don 't know anything about Jimmy Roemer 's crash . I 'm pulling in . Uh , uh , uh . Not so fast , Nigel . You might as well give up . I have control of your car . - You 're out of your mind . - Think so ? [ Beeps ] - What the hell ? I can 't slow down . - Now you know how it feels . Careful . I 'd really hate to see you crash . - What the hell is going on ? - I want to know why you sabotaged R.J. ' s car . [ Jarod On Speaker ] Why you nearly killed Jimmy Roemer . [ Nigel On Speaker ] You 're not making sense , Jarod . Now , stop this car . ! - Stop it , Jarod ! - Whoa ! That was a close call . For your information , I had your fuel tank topped off . So you should be good for at least , oh , 70 laps . The bad news is I put on four old tires . My guess is one of them will blow anytime now . - You know what that means . - I can 't hold this anymore ! That 's the idea . All right . I rigged R.J. ' s car . [ Nigel On Speaker ] I didn 't know the kid was gonna be behind the wheel . I swear . ! - She 's getting loose ! - Now you know how Jimmy felt . I 'm heading for the wall ! Jarod ! Jarod ! - [ Beeps ] - [ Engine Winding Down ] You said it yourself , Nigel . That 's racing . [ Siren Wailing ] [ Chattering ] Nigel Brinkman , come with us , please . Watch your head . Please , Sydney . I don 't have much time . - Sydney . - I 'm here , Jacob . I want you to know that no matter what you did - what we did - I never blamed you . I think that together we robbed Jarod of his life ... and for that we will be judged . But I 've learned not to be angry and to forgive . I only hope that one day ... Jarod ... can feel the same . Gene . Gene ? Gene who ? Here . Try and write it down . Is itJarod 's real name ? Or his father 's ? - Who is Gene ? - [ Gasps ] Please , Jacob . I need to know . [ Bagpipes : " Amazing Grace " ] - [ Continues ] - I 'm sorry , Sydney . Jacob loved this song . And this place . It 's like him to have finally found his rest here . Where is he ? - Do you have any sevens ? - Go fish . Check the bedroom . - Any fives ? - [ Laughs ] You 've gotta be cheating . - No one . - I know Jacob was here . You are mistaken . My brother is dead . It 's dangerous to deceive the Centre . I wouldn 't push him . A man with a temper to match his marksmanship . Dangerous combo . [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Jarod ] It 's a beautiful place . Jarod . How did you know ? I called Broots . He told me aboutJacob . He said you 'd be away from the Centre for a few days , so I took a chance . It 's hard to be alone in the world , isn 't it ? I hopeJacob 's passing was ... easy . I believe it was . Oh , before he died , my brother gave me this . What does it mean ? Maybe your name . Maybe your parents . I wish I could be sure . Anyway , I hope it helps you find your own peace in the world .

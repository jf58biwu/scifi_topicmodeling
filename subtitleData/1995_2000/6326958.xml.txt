There never liked bitch . - You saved my life . - And you saved the mine . - I caught it well . - You 're alien hunter . - How you planned all this ? - I had an assistant , an old hacker , crook , a man infiltrated . Here it is . When I realized I miss you , I asked Herman to help me bring you back . I cobbled together a plan . Let me give Herman in your exchange . The aliens took the bait , and I trapped . It was great , Larry . It 's nice to see you finally cooperating . - Hello guys . - Hey , Stan . I fell asleep in the car . Fruit Sangria gives me this all the time . Binary Bandits again together . What now ? Now I can not stop . You have to keep fighting . I will help as I can . I will send you checks . - Huge sums of money . - Thank you , Herman . You can be sure , my friend . Good . Hey , Stan ... - I could go with you , Larry . - It 's too dangerous . Foster and I have plans for our followers . A day will come . Besides ... We will always remember high school . I have dealt with the past to celebrate the graduation meeting and received a clear message from Gua . They are at the forefront with Cade Foster , and I was framed just like him and framed him . Eddie ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ? What happened ? - I arranged things . - Have you arranged things ? Da . Okay , let 's go . Eddie ... As for my friends , I would have thought that Stanley was Herman 's side many years ago , but I could not imagine being so brave in the face of death . Now I know that the invasion began . We hold in our fight against Gua . By dealing with the pain of the past old wounds have healed and I understand better who they are . I may be paranoid , but certainly not crazy .

 [ sighs ] There ain 't enough petunias in all of Poughkeepsie to make a girl forget about this mug . That is , if I still even have a girl . Sheesh , I been so busy workin ' on the new headquarters , I ain 't made the time I should 've to see Alicia . Especially since I got turned back into this big pile of ugly orange brick . Agh ! Who am I kiddin ' ? Alicia 's probably found somebody else by now . Somebody who doesn 't look like a bad blend of Frankenstein and Mount Rushmore . - Agh ! - [ screaming ] - [ woman ] Help ! - What ? [ screaming ] - Help me ! - Hey , hang on , lady ! Here comes 500lbs of grumpy gravel to the rescue . Ah , looks like it 's your lucky day , lady . And you just crapped out , mister . Jeez . What ... ? Hey , I didn 't mean to make you wet yourself . Ha , ha , ha . It 's not that easy to hurt Hydroman . This ain 't doin ' wonders for my lousy mood , lady . Now , are you in trouble or what ? No , Benjamin Grimm , you are . [ roars ] I 'll take it from here , Medusa . If you think a little shock in the shorts can keep me from clobbering ' you ... Hmm , your strength is even more impressive than rumored . Trapster , paste him down . It 's a pleasure , Wizard . Agh ! One size fits all . Behold , as my id machine brainwashes Mr. Ben Grimm . Weakening the good part of his character and strengthening the bad . Ha , ha , ha . [ Ben ] Argh ! That 's enough , Wizard , you 're killing him . No , my dear Medusa . I 'm merely destroying all the good within him . Hear me , Grimm , the Fantastic Four are your mortal enemies . Especially Reed Richards . No , he 's best friend . Friend ? Reed Richards , you call friend ? He who foolishly exposed you to unknown cosmic rays ? Resulting in your becoming the hideous creature you are today ? Grr ! My dear Benjamin Grimm , Reed Richards destroyed your life . No . Yes . Reed Richards did this to me . Made me into a thing . And for that Reed Richards must die ! [ Sue ] There 's nothing like home , sweet home . Huh , darling ? You 'd think these guys were working for Doctor Doom . Destroying the Baxter Building is getting to be a real growth industry . Well , now , we 'll anticipate better luck with our new Four Freedoms Plaza . But I am explaining why I was two hours late . You think your average sicko villain cares about my social life ? - So , about that movie . - [ dead line ] Hello ? Hello ? Aw ... - Maybe if I had my own digs ... - Johnny , we 've discussed this . Let me guess . Uh , girlfriend trouble ? No trouble , no girlfriend . Yeah , now , there 's a bad joke . The Human Torch can 't even find a real flame . Even our ever-lovin ' blue-eyed rockpile has a steady girl . Then why does he keep ignoring her ? [ all ] Alicia ! I know you 've all been busy , but Ben hasn 't called or come to visit me for days . So I thought I 'd ... Alicia , Ben left for your place last night . But he never arrived . [ Sue ] Don 't worry , dear , we 'll find him . - Fantastic Four , come in . - It 's Ben ! Hustle your blue-eyed butts down to the warehouse at Front and Third , pronto . You ain 't gonna believe what I got for you . - You better stay in the car . - But , but I ... No , no , Alicia , Johnny 's right . You 'll be safe here on the roof . No telling what Ben 's found inside . Looks like Ol ' Blue Eyes is here all right . - Ben ? - Yeah , come on in , pal . I 've been waitin ' for you . It 's a trap . And I 'm the Trapster . Poetic , huh ? Flame on ! Hydroman ! This oughta light your fire , boy ! Hey , stop babying me , Sis , I coulda outrun that bilge bucket . Sorry , little brother . Johnny . Impressive power , Susan Richards , but less then nothing compared to Madam Medusa 's . Ugh ! Ha , ha , ha . Who are these creeps ? [ screaming ] Phew , did you get a load of her ? I go for redheads in a big way . Ah , save it , Johnny . Are , are you all right , dear ? Ha , ha . How sickeningly touching and how inevitably futile . Get outta the way ! It 's about time you showed up , you big galoot . Ben ! Are you all right ? How can I ever be all right , you ego-loaded egghead ? Your harebrained schemes turned me into this monster . Ben , stop ! What are you saying ? Back off , toots . Nothing personal but I 'm about to make a widow outta you . Johnny , I 'll get ... Welcome to my shrinking-paste bubble , doll . It 's gonna take all of your force-field energy just to keep it from crushing you . He 's right . I don 't know what they 've done to you but ... Done , ha , ha . I 'll tell you what they 've done . They 've helped me see you for what you are , Richards . My worst enemy . - Ouch ! - Reel it in , you big gorilla . - I don 't want to burn you . - Shakin ' in my orange bootees ! I 've been waitin ' to do this for years . Old Sparky here is all yours . Now your Bunsen burner brother - in-law can 't protect you , I 'm gonna crush the bounce outta you . Patience , my friend , patience . First let Richards learn exactly who defeated him . Off hand , I 'd say it was me . But if you want to do a little gloating , suit yourself . Ah , the esteemed Mr. Fantastic . And do you know who has you mounted here like a brilliant , albeit short-lived , butterfly ? Hey , I recognize you , you 're the Wizard , brilliant inventor of incredible devices for the very rich and the very evil . Very good , Richards . Yes , yes , I am that very same Wizard the world used to talk about , until you came along with your free patents and affordable inventions for the common man . Luckily , I found fellow inventors , gifted yet unappreciated , who shared my visi√≥n . Peter Petroski , formally Paste Pot Pete . Petroski ? Yes , the research chemist who invented multipolymer liquid . Now known as The Trapster . Meet Mory Benz . Better known as Hydroman . Capable of transforming the atoms of his body into water . What 's the matter , Torch ? Get your matches wet ? Careful , Hydroman , he 's only a boy . Madam Medusa , the last link in my unbreakable circle of evil . - [ banging ] - What was that ? Relax , my dear . It 's only a cat . Medusa 's past is a mystery but her unique mastery of hair , it 's extraordinary . Not to mention useful . Together , we 're the unstoppable Frightful Four . - Don 't you mean five ? - Ha , ha , ha . Surprised at your friend 's change of heart , Richards ? You shouldn 't be . Only my brilliance could create an id machine capable of turning even Ben Grimm evil . Yes , once again the world will marvel at the Wizard , as my Frightful Four rob it blind . Because Reed Richards and his Fantastic Four will be no more . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Yeah , enough yappin ' , bullet head . Is it clobberin ' time or not ? Apologies , my dear Thing . By all means , feel free to indulge yourself . Destroy Reed Richards . Argh ! Only one chance . Johnny ! Reed can 't avoid Ben 's punches much longer . If I can just flame on fast and hot enough , I might be able to melt this sprinkler head . Oh ! Still too damp . Third time 's a charm , brain boy ! Free ! You freed him , you clumsy fool ! Trapster , stop him ! No way , paste puss , I 'll take care of Gumby . Almost dry enough to flame on ! Johnny ! Help Reed ! Why don 't you just leave him to The Thing ? Now you see me ... I 'll lay down some cover fire , Sis . When I catch you , even a chiropractor won 't be able to tell your head from your butt . Hey , Red , alley-oop . Back off ! That living ' inner tube is all mine . If I can invert this id machine 's power output ... Ah , forget it , Einstein . There ain 't nothing wrong with me that clobberin ' you can 't cure . Seems like we never get to spend a quiet moment alone any more , dear . I see you 're hiding behind your old lady 's tights , Richards . Reed , Ben 's too powerful . Can 't sustain this field ... much ... longer . Just a little more time . I think you 'll find my anti-gravity disk a marvelously uplifting experience , Torch . Not cool ... Boy , am I ever having a bad flare day ? - Is he all right ? - Why so concerned , my dear ? Concentrate on vanquishing our enemies . They 're up in the loft . Got it ! Sue , release your force field . - Are you sure ? - Do it now ! Sue , reverse the polarity . I hate you beyond hate , Richards . It 's not working ! Increase the amperage . I 'll try to hold him . Get off of me , you ... Argh ! Now , now , Mrs. Richards , it isn 't nice to fool with other people 's inventions . Okay , Stretcho , it 's tombstone time . Oh , yeah , this is gonna be good . - Ben , no ! - Huh ? What are you saying , Ben ? Reed is your best friend . - Alicia , run ! - What ? Get her ! No ! What 's happening ? Ben ! What ? Alicia ! Leave her alone ! Look at yourself , Ben Grimm . Remember your hatred for Reed , how he destroyed your life . Ben ! Help ! Yes , listen to Alicia , Ben , I 'm your friend ! Shut up ! That 's right , Grimm , remember how Richards made you the pathetic ugly creature you are . No , Ben , you 're not ugly or pathetic ! Your the kindest , gentlest man I 've ever known . I 'm finished . So am I. Let her go , Rapunzel . Take care of my girl , will you , pal ? Any time , my friend , any time . I 've got me some real , righteous clobberin ' to do . Stop ! Richards is the enemy . Wrong , chrome dome . You are the enemy . No ! Something tells me Ol ' Blue Eyes is back . You repulsive monstrosity . You 're still no match for my powergloves . Did someone say " match " ? Looks like the gloves are off , Wizzy . We must flee while we still can . It 's not quite time to leave the party . Not to worry , I got her , Sis . I like chasing girls , but man ! - Where 's Medusa ? - I can 't believe it ... - But ... I let her go . - You what ? - But how could you ... ? - I don 't know ! I kinda felt sorry for her , you know ? - She seemed scared and ... - I know . All your heat must be fricasseeing your flame brain . Or ... were you just dazzled by another pretty face ? I see you 're back to your usual charming ways . - Twerp . - Rockhead . - Ben ! Please ! - Sorry , sweetie . Oh , by the way ... Better late than never . Oh , Ben . They smell lovely . How come you don 't bring me flowers any more ? - Uh ... late hours at the lab ? - And ? Now , Sue , if you receive flowers every day , - how special would they be ? - As special as those anniversary ones . - Exactly . Anniversary ? - [ Sue ] Which was ? Uh ... But , dear , every day with you is special . - You love surprises . - Speaking of surprises , what about the toilet seat ?

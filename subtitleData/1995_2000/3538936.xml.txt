 Tomorrow , you 'll make a delivery to Ebola Nine , the virus planet . - Why can 't they go today ? - Tonight 's special . I want you all to be alive . It 's the Academy of Inventors annual symposium . - Wow ! I love symposia ! - The scientific event of the season . Every member presents an invention . The best one wins the Academy prize . - Sounds boring . - Oh , my , yes . But not this year ... ... because my latest invention is unbeatable . Behold , the Death Clock . Jam your finger in the hole . This readout ... ... tells you how long you have to live . - Does it really work ? - Sometimes it 's off by seconds ... - ... what with free will and all . - Cool . How long do I have to live ? Dibs on his CD player ! A Big Piece of Garbage FARNSWORTH : Oh , my , yes . - Who 's the nerd ? - That 's me at the first symposium . I 'm the Academy 's oldest living member . - These youngsters look up to me . - Well , well , well . Look who 's showing his wrinkled face . - Just leave me alone , Wernstrom . - You 're over the hill , Farnsworth . Leave science to the 1 20-year-olds . You think you know everything . I invented things when you were barely turning senile . Go home before you embarrass yourself , old man . Now excuse me . I 'm taking a nap before the ceremonies . Who 's that jerk ? He was my most promising student 1 00 years ago , at Mars University . But then , after one fateful pop quiz ... . A-minus ? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus ! I 'm sorry , but penmanship counts . I swear I 'll have my revenge if it takes me 1 00 years . And here it is , slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge . I 'm essentially in the clear . I 've been perusing your fortified wine list ... ... and I 've selected the ' 71 Hobo 's Delight ... ... the ' 57 Chateau Par-Tay , and the ' 66 Thunder Chevitz . Exquisite choices , sir . And mix them all together in a big jug . Welcome to this year 's symposium . I 'm your host , Ron Popeil ... ... inventor of Mr. Microphone , the Spray-on Toupee ... ... and the technology to keep heads alive in jars . Wait , there 's more . We 've got many inventors tonight ... ... starting with that up-and-coming young star , Ogden Wernstrom . - Boo ! - More wine ! Distinguished members of the Academy , I present the Reverse Scuba Suit . Observe . Fetch ! Now , sit . I said sit ! Bad fish ! [ APPLAUSE ] Don 't worry . It 's no competition for your Death Clock . What will you be presenting , grandpa ? It 'll put you young whippersnappers in your place . I hope it 's not as lame as last year 's Death Clock . - Last year ? - That 's right . Oh , my . - Did it put you youngsters in place ? - Hardly . We laughed until our teeth fell out . Come along , Cinnamon . I have to invent something new in the next 1 0 minutes . Perhaps some sort of Death Clock ! Uh , professor ? [ PROPELLER ENGINES WHIRLING ] - Very nice . - Amazing ! Our last presentation comes from our oldest member , Hubert Farnsworth . Professor ? Just a second . Just a second . Pencils down , prune-face . Here I am . Now , hello there . We all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects ... ... but what if we want to smell those objects ? Well , now we can . Thanks to my new invention ... ... the Smell-O-Scope . The odor travels past this coffee stain here . Around the olive pit ... ... and into this cigar burn . And this appears to be a ... ... doodle of myself as a cowboy . [ CROWD LAUGHS ] But the Smell-O-Scope is brilliant ! Think of the astronomical odors you 'll smell , thanks to me ! [ CROWD LAUGHS ] Oh , my . [ CROWD LAUGHS ] I 've waited 1 00 years for this . I give your invention the worst grade imaginable : An A-minus-minus ! [ CROWD LAUGHS ] Now for the presentation of the award . I 'm practically giving this away to ... ... Dr. Wernstrom , for his fish thingy . [ FARNSWORTH SNIFFS ] Perhaps 1 49 is just too old to be a scientist . - Yep . - No , professor ! Don 't give up ! There were many times in my century when I never gave up . Never . Are you even listening to me ? Oh , I give up . By God , you 're right ! I 'm going to build that Smell-O-Scope ! FARNSWORTH : Eureka ! FRY : Did you build it ? No , I remembered that I built one last year ! Go ahead , try it . You 'll find that every heavenly body has its own scent . Here , I 'll point it at Jupiter . [ FRY SNIFFS ] - Smells like strawberries . - Exactly . And now , Saturn . Pine needles . Man , this is great ! As long as you don 't make me smell Uranus . - I don 't get it . - I 'm sorry , Fry . Astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all . - What 's it called now ? - Urectum . Here , let me locate it for you . No , I think I 'll just smell around over here . [ FRY SNIFFS ] [ FRY GAGS ] What is it ? Oh , jeez ! Oh , man ! Remarkable ! A stench so foul it 's right off the funkometer ! Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe ! Oh ! Name it after me ! I think it 's moving . Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory . My God ! It 's headed straight for us ! With enough force to reduce this city to a stinky crater ! We have less than 72 hours . Well , let 's get looting . [ BENDER WHISTLES ] This thing will destroy the whole city ? What the heck is it ? Just as I thought ! The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet . NARRATOR : New York City . The year 2000 . The most wasteful society in history was running out of places to bury its never-ending output of garbage . The landfills were full . New Jersey was full . Under cover of darkness , the city put its garbage out to sea on the world 's largest barge . [ MAN WHISTLES ] The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it . Not even that really filthy one . You know the one I mean . Finally , in 2052 , the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space . Some experts claim the ball may return to Earth . But their concerns were dismissed as " depressing . " You got that off the Internet ? In my day it was only used to download porn . Actually , that 's still true . Now that the garbage is in space perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions . With gusto . Aw ! That 's it . Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York ... ... New New York will be destroyed by a ball of garbage . What the hell were you people thinking then ? - How could you throw your garbage out ? - Give me a break . - What do you do with it ? - We recycle . - Robots are made from old beer cans . - And this can 's made from old robots . That sandwich is made of discarded sandwiches . - Nothing just gets thrown away . - The future is disgusting . Typical 20th-century attitude . You 've no right to criticize my century . We invented the light bulb , steamboat and cotton gin . - Those are from the 1 9th century . - They probably just copied us . Please ! There 's no time for this now ! This is an emergency ! We must warn the mayor ! Garbage ball , huh ? That sounds serious . Very serious , Mayor Poopenmeyer . I hope this isn 't a fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke . Send in my science adviser . - Wernstrom ! - Well , well , well . Come to present your latest napkin ? I 'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us . Smell for yourself . Hey ! Holy jeez ! That smell could be anything ... ... a faulty stench coil , cheese on the lens , who knows ? We just got this transmission from Neptune ! RECORDED VOICE : Giant garbage ball passed close by . Horrible stench ! [ RECORDED VOICE GAGS ] The transmission ends there , sir . [ RECORDED VOICE GAGS ] No , I guess it keeps going . [ RECORDED VOICE GAGS AND STOPS ] - There we go . - My God ! The senile old man is right ! - Do you mean him or me ? - Him ! Next , New New York in crisis . Morbo ? Thanks , human female . Puny earthlings were shocked to learn that garbage will destroy their pathetic city . - I 'm glad we live here in Los Angeles . - Morbo agrees . [ NEWSCASTERS LAUGH ] - Can 't we shoot a missile at it ? - The supercomputer 's simulation ... ... shows that the ball is too gooey . Missiles would go through it . But suppose we sent a crew to plant an explosive on the fault line ... ... between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of AOL floppy disks ? In theory , it could work . But you 'll never find a crew willing to go on such a suicidal mission . Oh , crap ! FARNSWORTH : You only have one chance to destroy the ball . After that , it 'll be so close that blowing it up ... ... would cause garbage to rain on the entire planet ... - ... killing billions . - Boo-hoo . Here 's the bomb I 've prepared . Once activated , you have 25 minutes to get away . - That 's all- - ? - Now , now . We 'll discuss your objections when and if you return . Odor at magnitude eight . [ CREW GAGS ] Magnitude 1 2 . Magnitude 31 ! We 're breaking up ! Turn on the anti-smell device ! [ DEVICE HISSES ] FRY : Sporty . - Wow ! LEELA : Look at all this filth . FRY : It 's not filth . It 's a monument to 20th-century achievements . Look ! A real Beanie Baby ! A Mr. Spock collector 's plate ! [ PLATE BREAKS ] Some Bart Simpson dolls ! BART DOLL : Eat my shorts . - Okay ! Mmm , shorts ! This was garbage when it was new . Let 's blow it up already . This junk isn 't garbage ! I can dig anywhere ... ... and find something great . [ FRY CHOKES ] All right , let 's get to work . Let 's see . If that 's Hypodermic Ridge , then the bomb goes right here . Get ready . We 've got 25 minutes . " Fifteen minutes . " " Five minutes . Six-H minutes " ? There 's your problem . The professor put the counter on upside down . That idiot ! It wasn 't set for 25 minutes , it was set for 52 seconds . [ FRY SCREAMS ] - We 're gonna die ! Right ? - Right . It 's gonna blow ! Hey ! You 'll put somebody 's eye out ! Okay , keep your space pants on . I 'll take care of this . [ EVERYONE SIGHS ] - We 're saved . - Yeah , but the ball 's unstoppable now . New New York is done for . [ SCRATCHING SOUND ] All in all , this is one day Mittens the Kitten won ' t soon forget . Kittens give Morbo gas . In lighter news , the city of New New York is doomed . Blame rests with human Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny inferior brain . Oh ! How could I have put that timer on upside down ? I swear I followed the manual precisely . I 'm a dried-up husk of a scientist . This is all my fault . No , it 's my fault too . I 'm sure I threw out more than my share of trash . And when my toilet broke , I just went straight in the garbage can . Leela 's right . The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs . - Especially me . - Enough ! You failed miserably . Time to put a real scientist in charge . - Wernstrom ! - The very same . - Wernstrom , can you save my city ? - Yes , but it 'll cost you . - First , I need tenure . - Done . - A research grant . - You got it . Lab access and five grad students , at least three Chinese . Done . What 's your plan ? What plan ? I 'm set for life . Au revoir , suckers . - That rat ! Do something ! - I would , but he 's got tenure . [ PEOPLE GAG ] It 's time to take action . Stephanie , cancel the maid . Have her come tomorrow . Well , I 'm out of ideas . Anyone ? Wait ! If we could build an object of the same size , density and consistency ... ... it might knock the ball away without smashing it to bits . Where can we find a substance the same density and consistency ? Alas , I don 't know . What about garbage ? Good Lord ! A second ball of garbage ! That just might work ! You can 't just find garbage in the streets . City 's been garbage-free for 500 years ! - Then it 's time to make some more . - Make garbage ? - But how ? - Stand back and watch the master . This Slurm can ? Now it 's garbage . These papers ? Garbage . This picture of your wife ? Pure garbage . Now you try it . By God , I think the boy 's got something ! Come on , the fate of the city is at stake ! Good . Don 't finish that . Throw it away . Drink that beer and drop the bottle . Very nice . Get that robot some more beer ! Trashing this room 's a start . Let 's get Fry 's message to the people ! People of New New York , take a lesson from the 20th century . Stop this recycling and throw your garbage on the floor . Go on , chuck it anywhere like I did . Your city is counting on you . If my calculations are correct , this ball will knock the other ... ... directly into the sun ! If mine are correct , we 're all going to die horribly ! Places , everyone ! Prepare for launch ! Five , four , three , two ... ... three , four , five , six ... . Just fire the damn thing . FRY : Oops . [ HEART BEATING FAST ] [ HEART BEATS ONCE ] [ FAST DRUM BEAT ] [ SNIFFS ] - Burning garbage ! - It worked ! And so , on behalf of the entire city , I thank you , Professor Farnsworth . I present you with the Academy prize , which we confiscated ... ... from Wernstrom after we realized he was a jackass . In your face , Wernstrom ! I 'll get you , Farnsworth , even if it takes another 1 00 years ! And Fry , we owe you a tremendous debt as well . Without your garbage-making skills ... ... we 'd all be buried under 20th-century garbage . Should we be celebrating ? What if it returns to Earth like the first one ? Who cares ? That would take centuries . Exactly . It 's none of our concern . That 's the 20th-century spirit ! [ CROWD CHEERS ] Subtitles by SDI Media Group [ ENGLISH SDH ]

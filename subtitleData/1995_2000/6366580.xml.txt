 - Dr. Cabrera . - Where is he ? He 's down in trauma . They said you 'd know what 's wrong with him . - Who transferred him from ICU ? - I did ... he was scheduled for , uh therapeutic plasmapheresis . They were prepping him . He went into shock . - What are his vitals ? - Not good . Pulse is 40 . Blood pressure 80 / 50 . His GCS is six . Okay . Get on the phone to the FBI . There 's an Agent Scully that should be notified . - FBI ? - This man is an FBI agent . - What 's wrong with him ? - What 's wrong with him is he 's going to die . Can you hear me ? Mr. Skinner ? I 'm not understanding . Can you speak up ? What 'd he say ? A name . He 's coding on us . Clear ! Dr. Cabrera , clear . Dr. Cabrera ! Let him go . Every minute of every day we choose . Who we are . Who we forgive . Who we defend and protect . To choose a side or to walk the line . To play the middle . To straddle the fence between what is and what should be . This was the course I chose . Trying to find the delicate balance of interests that can never exist . Choosing by not choosing . Defending a center which cannot hold . So death chose for me . SOUTH STREET GYM 24 HOURS EARLIER Go easy on him , Slugger . I need him to lock up for me tonight , okay ? Don 't telegraph that left , Dre . Stevie Wonder would see that one coming . You 're fighting the FBI now , Dre . Fight smart . Go ! Hey , Slugger . You okay ? Slugger , can you hear me ? Talk to me . You all right ? - Slugger . - Mr. Skinner . Mr. Skinner . Hi . You going to stick with us now ? Do you remember what happened ? I was boxing . I must 've gotten tagged . Yes , you did . At least you didn 't get your ear bit off . That 's something , right ? Dr. Plant will be with you in a minute . Yeah . Skinner . Hello . - Walter ... Skinner . - Who is this ? Have ... you heard ... the news ? It 's ... in ... you . - What is this ? - You ... have ... 24 hours ... to go . What is this ? What do you want ? You ... are ... already dead . Mr. Skinner . Didn 't expect to see you up and around . You must be feeling better . Can you take a seat on that table for me , please ? I 'm Dr. Plant . I was here with you before . You probably don 't remember . - No . - Well , the good news is your dilation 's back to normal . Plus you still have both your ears . I heard that one . I 'm going to release you . But I suggest that you rethink the boxing . You 're not 20 anymore . There 's nothing wrong with me ? Well , you got your bell rung . Other than that , I think you 're fine . Might want to ice that bruise . What bruise ? Right here . - How the hell did I get that ? - Must 've taken a hard one to the ribs . But there 's nothing broken . No internal bleeding . Like I said ... You 'll live . Thanks . What is it , Agent Mulder ? I just , uh ... I thought I 'd poke my head in and say hey . Hey . - What , are you sleeping one off ? - No , I was having trouble seeing . It 's nothing . I just didn 't think I should drive . You going to be all right , sir ? He 's going to tell you he 's all right . - That 's because there 's nothing wrong with me . - Not that I could tell if there was . Why are all the lights out ? He 's having trouble with his eyes . He 's also got a nasty bruise on his ribcage . - What did you do ? - It 's nothing . - Says who ? - Says the doctor who released me from the hospital . That was the second opinion . The first was unsolicited . A phone call at the hospital . A scrambled voice telling him he had 24 hours to live . That was somebody yanking my chain . Look , I got a clean bill of health . In the last 48 hours , did you eat or drink anything that tasted metallic or otherwise odd ? Oh , come on . Are you thinking that I 'm poisoned ? - Did the doctor take your blood ? - Yes . And it checked out . - Well , if you were poisoned , it could have been overlooked . - If it did , why call and tell me at the hospital ? To scare you . See what you 'd do . Who you 'd turn to . Oh . This is about you . Or about the X-Files . You are so paranoid , Mulder . You 're not even on the X-Files anymore . I know . But you are . You still supervise them . What happened today ? Anything out of the ordinary ? I 'm not going to play this game . Look , it could 've been anything . It could have been the slightest touch , or a handshake . - This morning , you woke up ... - I woke up . Alone ? Yes . Alone . - And how 'd you get to the office ? - The same way that I always do ... I drove . - And then what ? - Then nothing ... I had meetings , I went to the gym , ... - ... to the hospital , and now I 'm here . - Just slow down . One step at a time . How 'd you get from the parking garage to your office ? The elevator . And then what ? I walked up the hallway . I passed the same dozen people that I pass every morning . I went to my office . I said " good morning " to my secretary . She said " good morning " to me . I returned calls , I did paperwork , I was here for the rest of the day . Now think . There 's got to be something . In the hallway , there was a man . He stopped me . He wanted to know the time . Did he touch you ? He grabbed me . On my right wrist . It wouldn 't necessarily leave a mark . Some poisons are absorbed through the skin . What time was it ? There you are . That 's him . Right there . Wait a second . Back up . It can 't be . That 's Kenneth Orgel . An advisor to a Senate subcommittee on ethics and new technology . - He 's a scientist ? - A physicist . Very well known , as far as physicists go . He signed in here as a visitor to the office of Assistant Director Walter Skinner . Why would he be coming to see you ? - I 'd like to ask him that myself . - Sir , if this man poisoned you , you should be off your feet and under a doctor 's care . If this man poisoned me I 'm going to put a gun to his head , find out why and ask him how he 's going to make me well . - What hospital was he at ? - St. Katherine 's . - Yes ? - Dr. Orgel ? Kenneth Orgel ? Yes . Do you know who I am ? No . My name 's Walter Skinner . I 'm an Assistant Director at the FBI . Dr. Orgel , you visited the FBI this morning . You came to see Mr. Skinner . No ... uh , you must be mistaken . Sorry , you 'll have to come back another time . - Go around back . - What ? Please , you 're bothering me . Federal agent ! Go ! Drop the gun . Drop it ! - Don 't push me , beautiful ! - Yeah , so 's your Mom . - Take your hands off me ! - Hey , give it a rest , huh ? ! You are such pigs ! Pigs should eat you ! No , you should die like pigs ! - Let him go , Agent Mulder . - What ? He 's got diplomatic papers . It 's our mistake . You can go . Just let him go . Get in the house . The police are going to be here any moment . I don 't have time to stand around and answer any questions . His name is Alexander Lazreg ... L-a-z-r-e-g . He 's the cultural attache with the Tunisian mission here in D.C. See what else you can find out about him . - You need to get to a hospital . - No . I 'm trying to stay out of one . 20 HOURS , 29 MINUTES REMAINING - The boxer , FBI . - Yes , you released him from your care earlier this evening . - Is he not all right ? - Well , that 's why I 'm here . He may have been poisoned . You 're kidding . By who ? I don 't know . In fact , I 'm not even sure what I 'm looking for . Well , you 're lucky . He 's on a government HMO . No one 's even bothered to handle his samples yet . Is this them in here ? I 'm not supposed to let you have those , not without a written release from the patient . We may not have time . He may not have time either . He had absolutely no symptoms of poisoning . - Are you sure these haven 't been processed ? - I 'm not sure , but I doubt they 've even been touched . I 'm not so sure you should be doing that . This is a crime scene . What would you rather I be doing ? I 'm concerned for Dr. Orgel 's personal property and the preservation of evidence . I 'd be a lot more concerned with the preservation of Dr. Orgel . Hello , Senator ... It 's carbon . Pure carbon . How in the world would that get into his bloodstream ? How is it working as a poison ? By all rights , it shouldn 't be . - Look at them , just rattling around in the solution . - It 's just bizarre . - Did you see that ? - Did you just touch something ? No , I didn 't . It just multiplied . Look ! It just did it again . Zooming in . What the hell are they ? Wait here , please . I don 't have to tell you how late it is , do I , Agent Mulder ? But I suspect that wasn 't even a consideration of yours . Actually , time is my only consideration , Senator . This was taken only three days ago . It 's of you and Dr. Kenneth Orgel holding a Senate Resolution : S.R. 819 , I think it 's called . What is that ? A funding bill . What is this all about ? A friend of mine is going to die because of S.R. 819 . I don 't know how , I don 't even know why ... - ... but I 'm betting you do . - What are you talking about ? I don 't even really know yet ; all I have are a few pieces : a Tunisian diplomat , this Dr. Kenneth Orgel , this health bill , S.R. 819 . All leading up to a plot to kill an Assistant Director of the FBI . Does that make sense ? The bill you 've referred to will provide money and supplies to the World Health Organization , medical technology to third world countries . I have aided you in the past with information , Fox , and advice , which right now is to leave here at once and never again suggest to anyone my involvement in any such dark intrigue . - Am I understood ? - This man may die ; he may only have a few hours to live . My intention is to save lives , Fox , but I can 't save his . Good night , Fox . Drive safely . 15 HOURS , 21 MINUTES REMAINING Dr. Plant ? - What ? What is it ? - I think I 've found it . I think I found what the carbon 's doing . It 's , uh ... it 's not just reproducing itself . It has behavior . It 's creating something , a-a matrix stimulated by blood flow in response to movement . It 's multiplying and solidifying in an orderly fashion . It 's building valves or-or dams in the vascular system . It 's building a heart attack . Dr. Plant ? - You 're doing blood work on a Walter Skinner ? - Yes . I just heard on the radio there 's a Walter Skinner who 's been picked up by paramedics at a parking garage downtown . - Where are they taking him ? - D.C. General . Did you see this ? We 've got some sort of extreme vascular event here . - How is he even still alive ? - We 'll take the left arm first . Mark it just above the bicep . Let 's get to it . I 'll get this side . Hey , you ... Out . - I know this man . - I don 't care . This is a sterile operating room . - Get these people out . - Look , I 'm sorry . His name is Walter Skinner . We 've been investigating his illness . What are you doing ? - If he 's gonna live , he 's gonna have to lose his arms . - No , that 's not going to save him . It 's his blood . - Who the hell is this woman ? - She 's a doctor . You 're not going to solve anything until you get a scope into him . Nothing else is going to work . Look , if you want to save this man listen to what I 'm saying . It 's okay , sir . Lie back down . We 're just moving you to another room . Who did this to me ? That 's what Mulder 's trying to figure out right now . But we 're going to take good care of you . I promise . We 're going to do everything we can . I don 't know . I can 't remember . Sir ? Is that you ? - Agent Mulder ! - Hey , do you have the key to this drawer ? - What are you doing ? - AD Skinner 's in the hospital . Somebody poisoned him . - Poisoned him ? Why ? - For doing his job . I-I don 't understand . I 'm looking for anything that relates to a Senate Resolution : S.R. 819 . If you want to save his life , you 'll help me open this drawer . - I don 't have the key . - You have a letter opener ? In your desk ? Something ? Is he going to be all right ? - What 's his condition ? - He 's stable , but it 's not good , Mulder . He 's got extreme vascular trauma and distension . His ... his blood has become a weapon against his body . - Well , can you fight it ? - We don 't know what it is . I mean , the best that we can do is keep lasering his arteries open . But it 's only going to be a matter of time before we lose . I mean , it 's-it 's building walls in his vessels faster than we can tear them down , and ... - ... and we just don 't have the technology to combat it . - Maybe we do . - What is this ? - I found this with Skinner 's morning mail . He was doing a security check on a Senate bill for violation of trade laws involving sensitive technology . Yeah , but this is just a routine procedure , Mulder . The FBI does dozens of these a year . No . This bill was going to vote in the Senate . All it was waiting on was Skinner 's review and an analysis by Dr. Kenneth Orgel . You 're saying that Dr. Orgel poisoned Skinner in order to cover up his analysis ? No . Orgel didn 't poison anybody . Orgel came to the FBI to tell Skinner what he knew , that there was a gross violation of export laws involving new technology . New technology . You know what that means ? Well , I think I might . That 's not me . - You want to get this ? It was in his pants pocket . - Thank you . - Hello . - Might as well ... give up . - Who is it ? - It 's a computer synth voice . You ... can 't ... stop it . - Somebody that must know he 's here . - Walter Skinner ... your time IS ALMOST UP . Federal agent ! Stop right there ! Sir ! - Yes . - The bill is in danger , Senator . A new threat has emerged . - You shouldn 't have called me . - Blood will be on your hands . - I don 't buy your hollow threats . - Well , Dr. Orgel does . You can ask him . What have you done with him ? I can tell you where to find him . The car is leased , part of a fleet service that services the diplomatic counsel corps . - What other forensic evidence were you able to lift ? - Not much on the outside . It 's not surprising considering the condition of the vehicle . Inside we found a couple hairs , human , from an expensive wig . Don 't hate me ' cause I 'm beautiful . What else ? Well , we scraped the tire treads , found something odd . It 's full of polychlorinated biphenyls , PCBs . Over 500 parts per million . Now that 's the kind of levels you used to see in the 1970s . Right before the EPA got fangs . - From where ? - Well , the PCBs are saturated evenly in the clay , uh ... Demo site , maybe , or , uh , an old power plant . Who 's in here ? Is someone there ? Oh ... Senator , please , let me go . I need ... water . Who did this to you ? Hurry ... please . It 's ... killing me . They believe you have exposed them to the FBI , to Walter Skinner . No . I told the FBI nothing . I told them nothing . Please , I promise not to expose anyone . 3 HOURS , 56 MINUTES REMANING Sir , there 's something I 'd like to try . It 's a treatment called therapeutic plasmapheresis . It requires filtering all of the blood in your body . It 's a radical procedure and there is a danger that your body might go into shock . I 'm in your hands . I think I owe you an apology , Scully . You and Mulder . Sir ? I 've been lying here thinking . Your quest ... - ... it should have been mine . - What do you mean ? If I die now , I die in vain . I have nothing to show for myself . My life ... Sir , you know that 's not true . It is . I can see now that ... I always played it safe . I wouldn 't take sides . Wouldn 't let you and Mulder pull me in . You 've been our ally more times than I can say . Not the kind of ally that I could have been . - I remember now . - What ? - I can 't see his face , he has a beard . - Try . He was at the gym . At the hospital . He killed that man . He was at the FBI when Orgel approached me . He was following you ? The tape ... he 's on the surveillance tape . You must be surprised to see me here . - I 'm sure I 'm not the man you 're looking for . - Where is he ? Where 's Orgel ? - Orgel is dead . - I don 't believe you . You lied to me this morning ; you 're lying to me now . - Drop this , Fox . - Where is Orgel ? ! I need to know what he knows . A friend of mine is dying . I tell you , they killed him . What Orgel knows died with him . Tell me what you know , Senator ! This is about S.R. 819 , isn 't it ? What the hell did they put in Skinner ? I 'm sure you already have some idea , Fox . It 's the same technology that S.R. 819 will export . Technology that the world believes is purely theoretical . Nanotechnology . Microscopic , atom-sized machines ? - Machines can be stopped . - Your friend is already dead . - I don 't believe that . - If you pursue this , Fox , they will kill you . - Not before I expose you and your role in this . - My role ? I am a victim here . Don 't you understand that ? I 'm fighting for my life . - I will stop this ! - It 's too late , Fox . It 's too late ! All right , he 's coding on us . Clear . Dr. Cabrera , clear . Dr. Cabrera ? Let him go . Call time of death , 9 : 33 . THREE WEEKS LATER Sir , I 've spoken with your doctors and your prognosis is excellent . Whatever you are infected with appears to be dormant and your recovery is being hailed as miracle . The man who poisoned you was at the FBI that day . Scully was able to pull these off the security video tapes . Hopefully , it might jog your memory . Maybe you can identify this man . No , I 'm sorry . S.R. 819 was withdrawn by committee late last night . Without explanation . Good . So this man failed then ? If that was his true motive . If he wanted to poison you to prevent you from investigating S.R. 819 , why call you to tell you that ? This man worked for the government that was to receive this technology . He drove one of their cars and he killed one of his own to save you . So you still think this is about you ? About the X-Files ? Yes . Yes , I do . And I have an idea who may be behind all this . But I 'd need your authority to continue the investigation . I have neither the authority nor the will to allow your continued inquiry into this matter . You 'll perform your duties as directed by AD Kersh and only AD Kersh . Sir ? This matter 's closed , Agents . Am I clear ? I 've been expecting you to show up . You know I can push the button any time . What do you want from me ? What 's this about , Krycek ? All in good time .

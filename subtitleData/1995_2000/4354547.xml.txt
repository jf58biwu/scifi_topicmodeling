 [ Dogs Yipping ] [ Helicopter Whirring ] [ Broots ] Miss Parker , this must be what hell looks like . You know , frozen over . Looks like an old research lab . What do you think Jarod 's father was looking for ? [ Sydney ] What is it , Miss Parker ? It 's a brass trigger for an incendiary device . Whatever was going on down here , Jarod didn 't want anyone to find out about it . Yeah , but why would he want to cover his tracks now ? Maybe it wasn 'tJarod who set off the bomb . [ Miss Parker ] Then who did and why ? Combo to Al Capone 's vault ? Ah , just some burned-out trash . - [ Sam ] Miss Parker ! - [ Miss Parker ] What is it , Sam ? - We found another body . - [ Broots ] Do you think it 's Jarod ? No . Jarod 's been a phoenix one too many times for me to believe he 's still in these ashes . Give my daughter my ring . And this photo . Tell her that I love her . [ Jarod ] I will . Captain , what was it that my father found here ? Wasn 't just any human D.N.A. They were deciphering . It was yours . [ Gasps ] Demons live in your dreams . [ Jarod ] They visit . The ones who cause you and your father trouble ... were at the research station . What did they find ? What they search for is no longer there . Before your father left , he told me he was going to find his son . He would stare for hours at the constellation ... talk about the son that he knew he would one day find . - The constellation ? - Yes , uh - Gemini . He told me if I ever met you to give you these . Is this him ? - Is this my father ? - Yes . Gemini . What does it mean ? He left a message for you . This is where you 'll find him . This is where you 'll find your father . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - [ Chattering ] - [ Wheels Squeaking ] I received a call from the Triumvirate this morning . Big Mutumbo himself . He knows thatJarod and his father were in the Arctic ... and he knows about how our project up there has been compromised . [ Mr. Parker ] Damn . What did he say ? Except for the fact thatJarod 's still out there , he was , strangely enough , elated . He 's taking the compromising of the research as - and I quote - " a sign from God . " Well , that 's an odd comment coming from an admitted atheist . Mutumbo 's ordered the acceleration of Project Gemini . - He wants delivery A.S.A.P. - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - Is that a problem ? - No . But Miss Parker might be . Like mother like daughter . You know how Catherine felt about Gemini . Secrecy has always been the key to Gemini . I 'll handle my daughter . Everything 's gonna be just fine . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Young Jarod ] I finished my building . I 'm finished ! [ Young Sydney ] This one 's been with us for only 36 hours ... and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . - [ Young Jarod ] Hey . I 'm finished . - Hi , Jarod . I 'm Sydney . - I 'll be taking care of you for a while . - Why ? Where 's my mom and dad ? [ Clears Throat ] I , uh , know it 's none of my business , Syd ... but sometimes memory lane could be a dead-end street . You 're right , Broots . None of your business . What is it ? Um , the bodies found in the Arctic came up negative forJarod . Still , I can 't figure out how he escaped that inferno . - [ Phone Rings ] - Jarod 's always been too smart for anyone to figure out . - [ Beeps ] - [ Jarod ] It 's cold in the Arctic , Sydney . Almost as frigid as the Centre . - Thank God you got out of there alive . - Barely . - But I made some interesting discoveries . - Tell me . What ? The boys in Blue Cove haven 't kept you in the D.N.A. Loop ? Or should I say strand ? I wasn 't even aware that we had a facility up there . - None of us were . - They 're stirring the genetic stew , Sydney . Deciphering the human genome . And not just anyone 's . Mine . My God . Did you find your father ? No . But I know he risked his life to find the same answers that I did . Does the word Gemini mean anything to you ? The zodiac sign ? - Why ? - I 'll ask my father . - I 'm on my way to see him now . - How will you know how to get there ? - He left me the stars to navigate by . - [ Beeps ] [ Door Opens ] Syd , I 've known you all my life . You knew my mother - how she had a psychiatric session with you just hours before she died . - Uh - [ Clears Throat ] I 'm gonna go . - Sit . Now , I 'm gonna ask you a question ... and I need to know the truth . What is it you want to know ? Did my mother ever mention a project - a reference code , anything - that had to do with the word Gemini ? I 'm sorry . Never heard of it . Damn it . My father , Mr. Raines , Lyle - They 're shutting me out of something big . Something they called Project Gemini . Uh , you mean like the twins . Since Dr. Know-Nothing can 't help ... I guess that 's , uh - No . We 're going to find out . [ Door Opens , Closes ] Excuse me . Number seven , please . - Right there . - Thank you . [ Phone Disconnect Signal Beeping ] [ Rattle ] [ Shouts ] - Where is he ? - Please don 't hurt me , man . Where is my father ? Jarod ? - Are you all right , Coop ? - Yeah , Sarah . Everything 's fine . - You just go back to work . - Are you sure ? Ah , absolutely . You go on now . Thank you very much . - [ Door Closes ] - You 'reJarod ? - You 're the major 's son ? - Yes , I am . - Where is he ? - He left real fast . - Almost like someone was hot on his trail . - Men in Town Cars . And the scariest man was a woman . A brunette ? Blonde . Suckin ' on a lollipop . Shejust left . Was my father hurt when he left ? No . That-That 's my blood . They pushed my nose into the wall . They-They damn near broke my nose too . Like I said , I thought maybe you was them comin 'back . I 'm sorry that you had to get involved with this , Coop . I didn 't tell ' em anything . Really , I didn 't . I 'd do anything for the major . - I 'm gonna miss our talks . - Did he stay here a lot ? Well , off and on for the past 20 years . Never was sure which direction he was headed to next ... but I knew it was wherever he thought you might be . Did he give you any idea where he might be going ? No . He said I 'd be safer not knowin ' . - Do you have another phone book around ? - Sure . Sarah , you got an extra phone book on your cart ? Yeah . Here . Take two . Thanks , darlin ' . - What you lookin ' for ? - What isn 't here . - I found something bizarre . - What ? - Like hair on your head ? - No . That would be fantasy . This is real . This is very real . [ Miss Parker ] An inter-Centre memo ? [ Broots ] A very old one . From your mother to the Triumvirate . " I vehemently disagree with Dr. Raines 's conclusions about Gemini ... " and despite some humane advances being made at Pakor ... " I cannot in good conscience endorse moving forward with the project . " While it represents a potentially major breakthrough for mankind ... " one must wonder if mankind is or ever will be prepared for its ramifications . Catherine Parker . " This is dated just days before she was killed . Gemini . Isn 't that the same thing you overheard your father talking about ? - Mom was against it . - I 'm still searching Gemini ... and I can 't seem to find anything about it . Well , let 's keep pushing , Broots . And while you 're at it , let 's find out about Pakor . [ Broots ] Okay , Miss Parker . [ Airplane Passing Overhead ] [ Man On P.A. ] Attention . Ground school group class B-5 ... will be held today in Instruction Room 204 . Please make note of the change . Excuse me . I 'm sorry to bother you , but I 'm looking for someone . Have you seen this man ? The new instructor ? Sure . - Is he here now ? - Right behind you . Not behind you behind you . Behind you . Up there . Does he have a radio with him ? Just wait . He 's almost finished . Why ? You know him ? He 's my father . Oh , my God . No . Dad . No . - No ! - Gotcha . Let 's go . We 're done . Move ! Move ! Let 's go ! - We need help ! - Dad ! Dad ! [ Man ] Oh , my God . It 's Dan Wilson . [ Man ] It 's tragic . Dan sneakin 'up in your dad 's plane . Major Charles 's quarters is right back here . Your father must have left early this morning . Looks like he left in a hurry too . Thank you . [ Shotgun Cocks ] Give me one reason not to shoot you . Carrie . Your father sent me . My father ? He wanted you to have these . My father 's dead , isn 't he ? [ Broots ] I didn 't find what I was looking for , but I found some good stuff . Nothing about Gemini or Pakor , I 'm afraid . But - But ... maybe something about your father 's secretiveness . - And ? - I 'm - I 'm pretty sure it 's aboutJarod 's father . They know where he is . Well , your father and Raines have been focusing in on one of the Arctic victims . A Captain Russ Osborne . Raines suspects that Osborne was chummy with Major Charles ... and may have even helped him get away from the research station . - We got an address ? - Osborne 's only next of kin was his daughter ... and she owns a small flight school down in Barney Fife territory . Uh , North Carolina . So the assumption would be that - Major Charles might be there . - Syd know this ? - No . He 's been in nonstop meetings all day in the Tower . Get him . He 'll drop it forJarod . We 're out of here . Floyd 's holding an empty barber chair for you , Broots . What 's the problem ? Well , see - [ Clears Throat ] This is where your father 's secrets come in . [ Miss Parker ] Centre travel records . My father already sent Bridget . [ Woman On TV ] The cause of this bizarre crash is still undetermined . However , several eyewitnesses who I spoke to here at the Osborne Flight School ... indicated that they heard a small explosive sound - Jarod 's father is not dead . [ Woman ] Dead on the scene is the pilot , Dan Wilson . [ Groans ] I 'd be sick to my stomach too . Excuse me . Here I go again . [ Sighs ] Morning sickness . Hell of a price to pay for an heir . No Sweeper team , no backup . No follow-through . Heirs have disappeared around here for a hell of a lot less . - That 's enough , angel . - No . Not enough , Daddy . You sent a rank amateur ... to do a job you knew I wanted myself . We 're talking about the man who killed Mom ... and you didn 't trust me . Shame on you . [ Carrie 's Voice ] To fathers . To fathers . You know , the last time I talked to my dad ... he mentioned seeing an old friend who had recently arrived in the Arctic . - My dad . - Mm-hmm . He admired your dad a lot , Jarod . His courage and tenacity . They were workin ' together toward exposing the research being done up there . God , I just wish he could have finished what he started . Carrie ... your father 's death won 't be in vain . I promise you . But in order to stop what 's going on ... I have to find my father and help him . Did he say anything while he was here that could help me ? He spent most of his time reading files and working on his laptop . Most of all he loved to fly though . He said it was his one release . Sure left here in a hurry . Mm-hmm . He rushed back from town , said some strangers were askin ' about him . He said hejust had this gut feeling that it was time to go . And then he made me promise to ditch his car . You have his car ? - Find something ? - Yes . The one with nothing . And a phone number . [ Sighs ] [ Beeping ] [ Line Rings ] [ Woman ] Pakor Frozen Foods is closed . Our office hours are 8 : 00 a.m. To 5 : 00 [ Beeps ] - What 'd you find ? [ Jarod ] Hopefully ... my father . [ Miss Parker ] Sydney , what do you mean you 're not going to North Carolina ? [ Sydney ] New duties beckon . Since when isn 'tJarod a priority one for you ? I 'd love to wax philosophical ... but right now I 'm busy . And you have a trip to take . [ Chuckles ] I 'll call you from North Carolina . Good luck with your new duties , Syd . [ Mr. Parker 's Voice ] I do have an office , you know . Gemini . Gemini is not something two people chat about at a urinal on SL 10 . Gemini ? There are very few secrets , Mr. Parker . Unfortunately , that 's a fact . [ Clears Throat ] What do you want , Sydney ? I want Gemini . If it is the reality I know it to be ... I want to be project coordinator . Raines might give you an argument about that . Not even Raines can deny that I am the most qualified . - There are younger people . - And how many haveJarod on their résumé ? Very good point . I 'll think on it . Sydney , let me ask you something . LfJarod were still at the Centre ... would you be making this pitch to run Gemini ? LfJarod were still at the Centre ... there 'd be no need for Gemini . Don 't look so scared , sweetie . I 'm only twice as mean as I look . Well , it takes a hell of a lot more than high heels to scare me , Miss - And you 're sure Jarod 's already left town ? Look , like I said , I kicked his butt when I saw him sleeping in there . All right ? All he said was somethin ' about heading ' down to Florida . Thank you for your time . - So , south , Miss Parker ? - She 's lying . We 're heading north . [ Man On Speaker ] This is Mark in Sector 7 . All clear here . Over . [ Man # 2 ] Roger that . Checking hallway . - Security breach in East Wing . - [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Grunts ] Oh , my ... God in heaven . It 's you ! Dad ! Let me look at you . Look at you . It 's been so long . - It 's you ! - Dad ! Ah . They found each other . The question is what else did they find ? Jarod 's father hit the jackpot . He got into the data bank and made off with several disks . - The embryo disks . - [ Groans ] [ Mr. Parker ] Then it won 't be long till they find out about Donoterase . - I 'm gonna have to tell Big Mutumbo something . - [ Raines ] If I were you ... I 'd come clean about the Centre mistakes ... and hope for benevolence from Mutumbo . Tell him everything 's moving along swimmingly ... and we look forward to his visit . When in doubt , lie . Sweetheart . You go find Jarod and his father , hmm ? Raines , call Donoterase . We transfer Gemini in 24 hours . [ Major Charles ] Doesn 't look like much , but we should be safe here . Looks like all the places that I 've hid out in over the years . Like father like son . For years I would lie awake at night ... wondering what you would be like ... what you would look like . But all those sleepless nights wouldn 't prepare me for how nervous I feel right now . I 've missed you so much . The first few weeks after you were kidnapped ... we got by on hope and prayers alone . Then it wasn 't long before I realized ... that if we were gonna find you , we 'd have to find you ourselves . And all that time running for your lives . Yeah . It seemed that ... everywhere we turned was just another place to run from Sweepers . I know the feeling . But bein ' here with you now makes all that pain go away . - [ Chuckles ] - I really want to see Mom and Emily . So do I. I 've been searching for your mother and sister ... almost as long as I 've been lookin ' for you . In an attempt to rescue you , I - I was separated from them . What happened ? A woman named Catherine Parker tried to help ... but things went wrong . The Centre came after me . And when it was safe , I went back . But your mother and Emily were gone . I don 't even know if they 're still alive . But they are . I saw them ... two years ago . Thank God . We 'll find them together . There 's something else . Kyle . - He 's , uh - - Yeah . I know , Son . I heard . I came upon that little town about two days after your brother was gunned down . But I 'm proud of you , Son . It 's amazing after all you 've been through ... that you still have the compassion to help others . I wish I could take some credit ... for your upbringing - that I could have been there with you . There 's some - something I have to ask you . Something I was told and I don 't want to believe . What is it ? Did you kill Catherine Parker ? What do you think ? [ Broots ] Donoterase . Does that name mean anything to you ? Sounds like an Italian mime troupe . I was down in the communications room last night ... and I intercepted a call from Raines to a place called Donoterase . Now he said your dad ordered that Gemini be transferred from there in 24 hours . - Any clue where Donoterase is ? - Well , I 'm working on it . Now this is their surveillance footage from Jarod and his Dad . Besides finding Jarod , Major Charles also stole some data disks . And he didn 't seem to mind who saw him do it either . Any man who 'd walk into the Centre and shoot my mother has the brass ones to do that . Any way to find out what was on those disks he lifted ? Well , I 'm running an anonymous sequencing search right now . - This is a Centre facility ? - Yeah . And the footage comes from a well-buried Centre location in Baltimore . Uh - [ Clears Throat ] Bearded ... - by the name of Pakor Frozen Foods . - Pakor . My mother referred to that name in the memo that she wrote about Project Gemini . Exactly . But why would Jarod 's father be interested in Gemini ? - And what does this have to do with your mother ? - I wish I knew . - [ Computer Beeps ] - What ? Data from the disks he stole . Broots . Succotash isn 't the only thing frozen in there . What kind of nightmare is this ? [ Muttering ] Hey . Wake up . Hey . It 's okay . You 're just havin ' a bad dream . I 'm sorry . L - I 've never been much of a sound sleeper . Well , what I found probably won 't help . I broke the code on one of the disks I stole . The Centre 's outdoing themselves . [ Jarod ] Pakor Frozen Foods is a biological storage facility . [ Major Charles ] Body parts , fetal tissue . Cows , sheep , horses . You name it . It 's Old MacDonald 's farm from hell . And Old MacDonald . There 's human embryos . - Oh , God . - What is it ? Ayear ago ... I went searching for my past , and it led me to ... the fertility clinic that you and Mom went to to get pregnant . I found out that it was owned by the Centre . My God . The doctors took your mother 's eggs . My guess is the Centre has them on ice somewhere at Pakor Frozen Foods . Gemini . I don 't know what it all means , but it 's all happening at a place called Donoterase . [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] You found Donoterase ? Yeah . And one thing 's for sure . The Centre didn 't want anybody to know about it . It 's only about 15 miles from here . That 's where they 're gonna transfer the Gemini from . And if we figured it out , so haveJarod and his old man . [ Major Charles ] The Centre database was specific on this location ... - but there 's nothing here . - [ Jarod ] That 's what they want people to believe . [ Cow Moos ] - [ Jarod ] This is Donoterase ? - I don 't get it . - What is it ? - Tire tracks . - Dual rear wheels . - Transportation vehicles . The question is what are they transporting ... and where is it going ? Hey . What are you doing here ? [ Groans ] I 'm not as old as you think . [ Monkey Chitters ] [ Chicken Clucking ] [ Sheep Bleats ] - [ Chicken Squawking ] - [ Coos ] [ Sheep Bleats ] [ Major Charles ] What do you think Old MacDonald 's up to ? [ Wheels Squeaking ] Time to transport him . What are you doing here ? Did you really think you could keep me from finding out about Gemini ? Let me tell you a little secret about myself . I love to be underestimated . So , are you gonna tell me what 's goin ' on here , or are we gonna do this dance ? [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Sheep Bleats ] [ Monkey Chittering ] What are they ? Designer livestock . Hey ! What are you guys doin ' in here ? - Hey ! - [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Gasps ] - You gotta be kidding me . - Get ' em ! [ Groans ] Move ! Move ! [ Groaning ] [ Alarm Continues ] You all right ? Who was that boy ? You looked like you saw a ghost . Not a ghost . That boy is me . They cloned me ! Let me help you . I 'm just gonna put a field dressing on it . Then when we get somewhere safe , I 'm gonna clean and re-dress it . - Where we headed ? - As far from the Centre as possible . - We have to go back . - No , Jarod . You 're hurt . I 'm fine . We have to go back . No . I 've been searching all my life for the family the Centre took from me . And after all these years , I 'm reunited with my son . I 'm not about to risk losing you again . This isn 't about me . It 's about him . I don 't know who or what he is . He 's a boy . And he 's part of us . I 've known the Centre to do some unspeakable things ... but to create a child - How were they even able to do it ? Years ago , they asked me to perform a cloning simulation . A cell containing the D.N.A. Blueprint of the desired organism ... is fused into a host ovum . The newly fertilized egg develops into an embryo ... and then it 's implanted inside a surrogate mother . That 's why they had your mother 's frozen egg cells . They implanted my D.N.A. Into her egg , knowing that it wouldn 't reject it . - It should never have happened . - But it did . Regardless of how that boy came into this world ... he is here , and he is our family . We can 't let the Centre possess him like they possessed me . We need help from the inside . Do you know anyone in the Centre you can trust ? [ Phone Rings ] This is Sydney . Please tell me that you had nothing to do with this . - With what ? - They took my genetic material ... and like I was some kind of farm animal , they cloned me . There were rumors , of course , but ... - I didn 't want to believe them . - [ Jarod ] Well , believe it . I saw him . I saw me . It was like looking into a mirror , only the reflection was 20 years younger . My God . This is beyond words . Sydney , you 're the only person at the Centre we can trust . Please help me . - I 'll do what I can . - [ Beeps ] [ Dial Tone , Beeps ] - [ Mr. Lyle ] He 's magnificent . - [ Mr. Parker ] Well , he 's a little nervous . He 's never been outside of Donoterase . No wonder secrecy has always been the key to Gemini . And no wonder Mother was against it . - Angel . - Don 't angel me . - They all knew about this , and I didn 't . - It was a Triumvirate directive . Eyes only . Hell , I 've only known about it a little while myself . He is an amazing specimen though , isn 't he ? Is there no depth to which we won 't sink ? - What 's bothering you ? - You let Raines play God . Your father doesn 't let me do anything . Gemini has always been mine . - [ Wheels Squeaking ] - Gene manipulation , cloning - It 's the cutting edge of technology . Welcome to the new millennium , Miss Parker . We 're 20 years ahead of the sheep cloners we hear about on the news . [ Mr. Parker ] We 're producing the finest beef at our place in Argentina . Each one designed to be exactly the same . Now that is progress . Daddy , Raines didn 't design a better Big Mac . He designed a human being . Oh , my God . He is young Jarod . Sydney , don 't tell me you knew about this too . Only four of us knew about this . And Mutumbo 's people at the Triumvirate . Sydney , I 've been thinking about your request ... and , uh , we 're gonna do it . - I 'm overwhelmed , sir . Thank you . - [ Wheels Squeaking ] What request ? I 'm making Sydney project coordinator on Gemini . And I want him to find out how he compares to the original Jarod . There 's no way he 's going to test my Pretender . The boy doesn 't belong to you , Raines . He belongs to the Triumvirate . And before we deliver him , I want a performance comparison ... done by the man who knows more aboutJarod than anybody else ! [ Whispers ] Sydney , you 're not really gonna participate in this . Parker , please . My name is Sydney . I 'll be taking care of you for a while . [ Jarod 's Voice ] What is this place ? [ Major Charles ] An old hunting shack . You , me and your mom were camping 'near here when you were a boy . A big storm came up and washed out the road . We had to take shelter here till it blew over . That 's funny . - I don 't remember . - I didn 't see it before , but it 's still here . - What ? - The scar . You were entertaining your mom . You climbed up on that ladder , tryin ' to take her mind off the storm , and fell . You cut your back . It was just the three of us for two days . It was like we were the only people in the world . It was only about a week before the - The Centre took me . Jarod . Catherine Parker told me some things . Some awful things happened to you at the Centre . - Doesn 't matter now . - It matters to me . What did they do to you ? [ Young Jarod ] I can 't do it , Sydney ! I can 't figure it out ! - You have to . - How much oxygen is left ? - Less than 48 hours . - What caused the explosion ? We don 't know . - Fuel ? - You 've shut down your gauges . Data is sketchy , but little . - Oxygen ? - You 've asked that already . - Now focus ! - There 's nothing that can save us . It is your job . It is your duty to save your crew ! - No . I can 't do it . - Of course you can ! Shut down now , and we all die . - You too ! - Wait a minute . I can use the gravitational pull of the moon to help get us back . - Pretty good . - I knew you 'd save us all if you wanted to . - He did well . - [ Raines ] Eighty-five seconds quicker ... than Jarod 's record doing the same sim . [ Sydney ] But factoring in the technological awareness available to the boy ... his accomplishment only just matches Jarod 's . Either way , it certainly proves his capabilities . I can 't wait to show him to Mutumbo . You sound like horse trainers talking about your prized three-year-old . [ Brigitte ] Another one of your morality issues ? - Like you 'd know anything about morality . - Oh , Miss Parker . No . Sydney , don 't you even talk to me . I can 't believe you 'd even participate in this . What is it ? A chance to relive the twisted experiments of your youth ? You know what they must have done to create that boy . Do you want your experiment back so badly that you 'd take his replicant instead ? [ Whispers ] Miss Parker , you don 't understand . You 're right . I hope I never do . [ Raines ] His inception was flawless . I even think your mother would have agreed that the entire Project Gemini ... has been run completely aboveboard . [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] Aboveboard , my cute little ass . - I don 't really feel comfortable discussing that subject . - Cloning ? No . Your cute little - Yes . Cloning . And I can 't believe Sydney would be involved in this mess . - Yeah , well , nothing around this nuthouse surprises me anymore . - You could say that twice . Well , they didn 't keep Gemini from me because there was nothing to hide . I 'm gonna find out the truth - what really happened . And I guess I 'm gonna help you . Hmm ? You bet your cute little ass . [ Sheep Bleating ] [ Broots ] I rerouted the sensors , so we should have a halfhour ... before anyone finds out we 're down here . [ Miss Parker ] Since we don 't have much time ... - why don 't you keep your eyes open and your mouth shut ? - That 's fine with me . 'Cause I don 't want to be down here anyhow . Check it out . This must be where they kept him . Wow . Not much of a place to spend the first 14 years of your life , is it ? Nice view . Miss Parker . Over here . [ Miss Parker ] " Specimen Anomalies Dissection Storage . " What does that sound like to you ? Oh , a freak show I don 't want any part of . What 's that smell ? Formaldehyde . Oh , that 's never a good sign . Oh , God . What are they ? Oh , I - I think they 're the " befores . " - Before what ? - Before they figured out what they were doing . The same thing happened with the early cloning of sheep and other mammals . They didn 't just re-create Dolly the Sheep after the first try . She was , like , the 375th . What happened to the first 374 ? They ended up like this . Mutations . Only they weren 't human . Oh , look at this . It 's got the body of a boy and a face like ... Colonel Sanders . It 's called progeria . It 's a genetic defect that causes accelerated aging in children . They can be seven years old , but their bodies are a hundred . - Oh , no . - [ Clangs ] - [ Gasps ] - Broots ! I 'm sorry . Ew ! Look at this place . Raines was playing God . And he unleashed the devil . [ Jarod ] No . No . No . No . Please . No . Please . No . What did they do to you ? I can 't open the hatch ! I can 't open the hatch ! It 's too hot ! L - I can 't think ! I 'm burning ! [ Young Jarod ] I can save him ! - No ! - This is your last chance . I did tell the truth . I 'm at peace . I feel tired . My legs hurt . I set myself on fire because I 'm convinced it 'll send a message , Sydney . [ Young Sydney ] It 's been three days , Jarod , with temperatures over a hundred degrees . - All you have to do is submit . - It 's not for me . - I 'll never give up . - [ Jarod ] It 's not your fault . [ Sighs ] - But - - We 're together now . That 's all that matters . That ... and saving the boy . [ Computer Twitters ] [ Major Charles ] I 'm into the Centre 's mainframe . Damn ! They 're onto me . But I 'm into Gemini . They 're transferring the boy to the Triumvirate . - When are they going to transfer him ? - I don 't know . Damn it ! They 've shut me out . There 's gotta be some other way we can find out . Someone who can tell us . [ Beeps ] [ Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Line Ringing ] - Come on , Sydney . Answer the phone . - Are you going to answer it , or shall I ? - [ Ringing Continues ] - It 's not important . - [ Beeps ] What we have to say is . The timetable on the transfer of our young Pretender has been moved up . He goes at dawn . My work won 't be completed . It can 't be avoided . The mainframe 's been compromised ... and we suspect Jarod and Major Charles . My father says you can continue your work with the boy once he 's been transferred . We expect your full cooperation . You have that . [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] " I vehemently disagree ... " with Dr. Raines 's conclusions about Gemini ... " and despite some humane advances being made at Pakor ... " I cannot in good conscience endorse moving forward with the project . " While it represents a potentially major breakthrough for mankind ... " one must wonder if mankind is or ever will be prepared for its ramifications . Catherine Parker . " [ Door Opens ] [ Exhales Sharply ] You got anything to drink ? Preferably something that burns . Need to cleanse your palate ? No . My soul . I backtracked the cloning records from Donoterase . Over the years , they fertilized 289 ova before they were successful with the boy . The results of which we saw at the specimen lab . Well - [ Clears Throat ] Some of them . [ Coughs ] And if you can believe it ... that sideshow wasn 't the weirdest part of the circus . They couldn 'tjust grow those ova in an incubator . - They needed donor wombs . - Surrogate mothers . Seems Raines found the women himself . Mostly disenfranchised , homeless , loners or coma victims . Women who wouldn 't be missed if there were complications . And-And believe me , there were plenty of them . Most fetuses never reached term . And-And ... the ones that did - Well , they didn 't even make it through - - Childbirth . - [ Scoffs ] Well , if you - if you could call it that . All of the surrogates who made it that far , though , they - theyjust - - Disappeared . - Without a trace . That 's what my mother was talking - talking about in this Gemini memo . What she feared could happen at Donoterase . What should I do ? Well , whatever it is , you better decide pretty quickly , because they 're moving the boy at dawn . Where ? Triumvirate station , Africa . Your mom 's first priority was the children . What would she do ? The same thing she was trying to do when ... she was killed : Rescue the children . I 'm over here . I 'm sorry . I didn 't hear you come in . Do you want me to do something for you ? No . I just came to talk . Talk ? You don 't want anything ? Just to see you . - Are you all right ? - Yeah . I 'm fine . Ready to work . - You were crying . - No , I wasn 't . L - I just - Don 't tell Mr. Raines . He gets angry if I show any emotion . It won 't happen again . I promise . It 's okay to cry . No , it 's not . Not for me . I 'm here to serve - to do what I 'm told . Is that what Raines taught you ? Yes . That I have been gifted with the intelligence designed to help others . Mr. Raines says emotions get in the way . If you don 't want me to work , then why are you here ? When I was your age , I knew a boy just like you . Exactly like you . I felt for him ... but I never let him know . I saw ... pain ... in his eyes ... but I looked the other way . I see the same pain in your eyes . But I can 't look away anymore . I don 't understand . Do you want to be here , or do you want to do what other kids do ? What do other kids do ? Play . Have fun . Experience life . - Is this a simulation ? - No . No . This is real . I 'm doing what I want to do : Sims to help others . Then why were you crying ? L - I wasn 't . I just - It 's okay . It 's okay . If Mr. Raines finds out , he 'll get angry . And when he gets angry , he - He - - He - - I won 't let him hurt you anymore . I promise . Now we gotta get you out of here . He 's not going anywhere with you . [ Miss Parker 's Voice ] I can 't believe this , Sydney . You 're going with them . - Yes . - Sydney , why ? - You too , Broots ? - You certainly fooled me for the last three years ... bumbling around the globe like a benevolent Dr. Spock ... when you 're really a , uh , psycho Dr. Mengele . You don 't know what you 're saying . [ Phone Rings ] It 's your original lab rat . - What are you gonna tell him ? - [ Ringing Continues ] - [ Beeps ] - Sydney . They 're going to move the boy . I need to know when . I can 't help you anymore . Sydney , I need your help . Please . [ Wheels Squeaking ] And another excursion into the mainframe would be useless . There is no refuge for you anymore . [ Beeps ] He hung up . [ Beeps ] He 's helping them . What did he say ? He said that another excursion into the mainframe would be useless . Why would he tell us where not to look ? Because someone else was there . It was his way of telling us where to look . He said the mainframe was useless . There would be no ... " refuge . " I knew I could trust you , Sydney . - Straight to the airstrip . No stops . - [ Engine Starts ] The transfer plane is meeting us just after first light . [ Car Engine Starts ] - You gotta be kidding me . - What the hell is goin ' on ? Let 's go , junior . We got places to be . [ Coughing ] [ Broots ] Miss Parker , what 's goin 'on ? Jarod . [ Car Approaching ] - Miss Parker . - Get him in the truck ! - Where are you going ? - Just get him out of here now ! Get in . - [ Engine Cranking ] - Get out ! Dad . - [ Coughing ] - Oh ! Damn ! Who are you ? I 'm you . [ Angry Chattering ] - You were the problem . - You need to get off my back . [ Chattering Continues ] [ Clanging ] Carelessness ... leads to chaos ... chaos to anarchy ... anarchy to ruin . This is the Centre . Ruin ... is not an option ! - Mutumbo , if I may - - Excuses are only yesterday 's failures . Only solutions matter now . Mutumbo , we all-we all want the same thing here : The boy and Jarod back . I am listening . So we fumbled the kid . We intercepted Jarod 's father . He 's our trump card . - Let 's play him . - [ Miss Parker ] And I guarantee you , sir . You give me 10 minutes with Major Charles ... and I 'll have every answer you want about whereJarod and the boy are . Brigitte will handle Major Charles . Thank you . If I may , sir - You will honor my wishes . Good answer . In the meantime , we haveJarod and the boy to track down . Mr. Lyle will lead that effort . [ Miss Parker ] Sir , with the possible exception of Sydney ... I knowJarod better than anyone here ... and he will not allow that boy to be captured . Yes . But what you are forgetting is the boy himself . He wasn 't raised to cooperate . Especially with Jarod . I 'm just saying it 's a waste of manpower and money to go afterJarod ... when the key to it all is the man sitting down in Renewal Wing . - Daddy . - Well , uh , Mutumbo has a good plan here . We need to follow it . [ Mutumbo ] Then it is settled . Two points of attack . Two generals , one plan . [ Wheels Squeaking ] [ Chattering ] Now I know what dirty laundry feels like . - Not here , angel . - Yes , here . How could you just stand there while Mutumbo shut me out ? For God 's sake , we 're talkin ' the Triumvirate here . Every action , every thought , every word I utter could be a death sentence . We both know I 'm the one who should be down there with Major Charles . And we both know sometimes I have to play things the way I play things ... whether you like it or not . " Play . " Oh , my God . We 're talking about the man who killed Mom . We 're talking about our family . I 'm talking about survival . The things I do , choices I make ... you probably never will understand . Tell me , Daddy . Are you really afraid of Mutumbo ... or what I may find out from Major Charles ? [ Elevator Bell Dings ] I thought I was off your Christmas card list . You were . Until our nosy little bald friend Broots confirmed my suspicions with this . You left e-mail forJarod in a box called " refuge . " You let him know when and where to find the boy . I had you pegged for the wrong witch in Oz , Sydney . I 'm sorry I doubted you . I 'm sorry I wasn 't able to confide in you . Or in Broots either . Human cloning - I ... don 't think I probably would have believed you anyway . When I went down to talk with the boy , it was , um - It was so surreal being with him . It was like I was suddenly 11 years old again . And yet - And yet ? And yet the boy is Jarod ... in every way except the most important one . He doesn 't have Jarod 's soul . And he didn 't have you . Miss Parker . When I found out they had made anotherJarod ... I knew that if I didn 't take control ... something important would be lost . If facing Major Charles is important enough to you ... then go . Take it . And everyone else be damned . [ Thunderclap ] [ Jarod ] Must be some matches around here somewhere . Aha . Yes . Little light in here . There we go . [ Thunder Rumbling ] You cold ? It 's probably too damp out there to hunt for firewood ... but maybe I can break up some of these old chairs . I don 't understand . Why are you so afraid of me ? - Is this a bad man ? - [ Raines ] Very bad . - What did he do ? - [ Wheels Squeaking ] This is the man who killed your parents . How can one feed such a terrible lie to a child ? Raines could feed candy to a diabetic and sleep like a baby . He doesn 't seem like a killer . He seems sad , Mr. Raines . Like there 's this void in his life that 's depriving him of any true happiness . Perhaps loss of a loved one . Or the loss of family . Maybe he feels the same way I do ... not knowing who he is or where he came from . You 're not concentrating . He 's no different from any of the others . I don 't know . I just - I feel I have a connection with him . - This boy 's good . - Mmm . Almost as good as the real thing . Wait a minute . What am I saying ? He is the real thing . [ Raines ] If you can 't find him ... he 'll go out and kill another little boy 's parents ... just like he killed yours . Do you understand me ? Good . [ Jarod ] I swear to you I had nothing to do with the death of your - [ Thunder Rumbles ] Of your parents . - Then what happened to them ? - It 's complicated . You 're a gifted young man . You have the ability to grasp difficult concepts . When I was a boy I used to look in the mirror and think about my past ... try to picture my future . - Do you ever do that ? - Yes . But I can 't see a past . When I was a boy ... I was stolen from my parents ... and I was held prisoner at the Centre . [ Thunderclap ] They exploited my mind . They made me do things . Things I never should have done . The same kind of things that they made you do . When I got older , I realized that they were using these things to hurt people . Even to kill them . So I ran away . You escaped . Yes . But not all of me . They kept part of me behind . Some of my - Some of my D.N.A. I guess they had a plan . A way to always keep me prisoner . I don 't understand . I think you do . If you could look into that mirror and see your future ... it would look exactly like ... me . But my parents . They don 't exist . They never did . At least not in the way you were taught . No . You 're lying . Mr. Raines said you were clever . You 're lying . I wish to God I was . But I 'm not lying . I 'm sorry . I want to show you something . That 's me when I was your age . [ Young Jarod ] No . I can 't do it ! - [ Young Sydney ] You shut down now , you all die ! - I 'm you ? - I come from nowhere ? - You come from here . And I come from two people who love me very much . [ Thunder Rumbling ] It 's okay to cry . I can 't . Mr. Raines won 't let me . [ Thunderclap ] - [ Young Miss Parker Screams ] - [ Young Sydney ] No ! Keep her back ! - Keep her back . - [ Young Jarod ] Leave me alone ! [ Young Miss Parker ] Mama ! [ Sobbing ] [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] [ Water Dripping ] You can beat me all you want . I 'd rather die than give up my son . You 're going to die , but it 's not about your son . It 's about my mother . You look just like her . You should know . You killed her . That 's my gun . The one you used to shoot her . No . It 's the one a man named Raines stole from me the day your mother was killed . She knew trouble was coming . [ Chuckles ] Why should I believe that ? Because it 's true . It was the day I was supposed to help her rescueJarod and two other children . Raines shot me , left me for dead ... took my gun . I still carry the bullet in my back . You bought yourself another second . Talk fast . Your mother located me . She knew I was searching forJarod . She was afraid of something called the Triumvirate . She said we 'd have to move fast - that this Triumvirate threatened her husband ... because of her action to rescue the children ... and her opposition to something she called Gemini . - They threatened Daddy ? - They threatened his wife and his daughter . You were the other child we were trying to rescue . Your mother was gonna take you to Europe the next day . Don 't you remember ? My father knew about these rescues ? My rescue ? That was how I saw it . But I can 't be certain . But I do know for sure ... your mother was scared for your safety and his . Afraid ofhow the Triumvirate controlled him . Raines was the Triumvirate watchdog then . He 's still howling . I didn 't understand why he took my gun all those years ago , but I do now . All your mother and father ever wanted was what I wanted : To love and be with our children . - [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Jarod ] Good morning . - [ Birds Chirping ] - [ Jarod ] Good morning . Breakfast . That isn 't wheat grass and tomato juice . No . That 's what they feed you . It 's called ice cream . You 'll never forget the first bite . Go ahead . Try it . Go ahead . - [ Chuckles ] - Mmm . It 's very good . There are so many incredible things in the world to try . Hope they 're all as good as ice cream . So , what are we gonna do now ? Right now I have to figure out a way to get my - our father out of the Centre . Maybe we should trade them for something just as important . I can 't believe I doubted him . All these years . All these years I 've - I 've wondered why Daddy hid things from me ... lied to me , dissuaded me from digging into her past ... but it was all for my own good . We all want to believe that our parents have our best interests in mind . But - I finally find some peace of mind , and you want to lobotomize it ? Isn 't there an apparent conflict between your newfound joy ... and your loading of this weapon ? It 's very simple . Raines dead ... me happy . Not an easy man to kill . Can 't help it if you 're a lousy aim . I don 't plan to miss . Miss Parker . Y-You both . - You gotta come quick - to the lobby . - Later , Broots . Oh , no , no , no . Trust me . You 're not gonna believe this . - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] - He 's right here . Move . Remember me ? [ Miss Parker ] Where 'd you find him ? [ Sam ] We didn 't . He came in on his own . Three years on the run , and it 's finally homesickness that brings you back . Well , actually , I came to cut a deal . Broots , go get my father . [ Jarod ] Oh , he 's not in his office . What kind of game is this ? It 's a simple one . You 'll get your father back ... when I get mine . So you 're proposing an equal trade . Your father for my husband . I wouldn 't say that it was equal , but it will do . Yes . And how do we know you 're not bluffing ? [ Gun Cocks ] Seeing is believing . I 'll call you in two hours to arrange the exchange . One of you will bring me my father . - Only one . - That 'd be me . That 'd be Sydney . Sydney ? This is my father we 're talking about . Our father . All the more reason to keep cool heads . Sydney 's the only person I can trust to play by the rules . - Where will the exchange take place , Jarod ? - Like I said , I 'll call you . I wouldn 't want anybody showing up early and complicating things . I really have to go now . Do you want to see your father again ? Alive ? - [ Wheels Squeaking ] - And you letJarod walk right out ? He has my father ! And we had him ! I made the only move there was , you son of a bitch ! It was your last one , Miss Parker . The Centre 's chain of command is clear . As long as Mr. Parker is absent ... Mr. Raines is in charge . And your plan is , Mr. Raines ? We organize two Sweeper teams . Once we know the location , one will scout and secure - [ Wheezing ] And the other will execute . No . No . No . You 're gambling with my father 's life . We do this just as Jarod said . Well , Raines 's experience with Jarod is just administrative . Look ... - I know how this guy 's mind works . - This is not a democracy . My decision stands . [ Phone Ringing ] - Jarod . - [ Jarod ] Interstate Road 40 . Iversonville , North Carolina . At 3 : 00 . Not 2.59 . Not 3.01 . 3 : 00 . - That barely gives enough time for Sydney to - - Then he 'd better get moving . Jarod , I want to talk to my father . - Daddy , are you there ? - [ Beeps ] Sydney , go . - [ Door Opens ] - Get Major Charles . Let 's move . [ Wheels Squeaking ] Like I said , two teams . [ Wheezing ] And I 'll need our best sharpshooter . I 'm your man . Jarod will not walk away from this . No . I wantJarod alive . And the boy too . It 's Mr. Parker who 's outlived his usefulness . That waste of skin Raines is gonna get my father killed . Well , I don 't thinkJarod would hurt your father . I don 't think . Jarod 's been searching for his father his entire life ... and he 's gonna do whatever it takes to get him back . I could see it in his eyes . - Well , then what do you think we should do ? - Same thing . Whatever it takes . Miss Parker . Jarod isn 't the only enemy this time . Don 't worry , Bridget . I wouldn 't forget about you . I know what you think of me ... but believe me , we both want the same thing this time . Mr. Raines is planning to kill your father . Why should I believe you ? Because if you don 't , somebody we both love very much is going to die . With or without you , I 'm going . Let 's do this together . Please . [ Major Charles ] I 'd like to thank you , Sydney . - What for ? - For raising my son . What he 's become is a reflection of you . What was he like as a child ? Someone a father would feel very proud to call his son . I 'm sorry you never had that chance , Major . In fact , I can 't imagine anything worse ... than what you 've had to endure . I can . - Not ever finding him at all . - [ Jarod On Walkie-talkie ] Sydney , are you there ? Yes , Jarod . You 'll see a road a quarter of a mile up . Turn right . My father will know where to go from there . [ Sydney On Walkie-talkie ] All right , Jarod . I 'll follow his instructions . Well , he - he didn 't say where . Only that his father knew . Great . We 're in the middle of nowhere with no Sydney ... and no idea where he 's going . - I know exactly where he 's going . - Yeah ? Well , where might that be ? To the beginning of this little odyssey . [ Sighs ] Well , I gotta hand it to you . Capturing the king is inspired . Walking into the Centre to cut your deal . - Real bold . - Not bold . Prudent . Necessity . Exhibition of resolve . You people only understand one thing : Power . Whatever it was , it was brilliant . No wonder my people have such a hard time catching up to you . Of course , that 's why we want you back . 'Cause you 're brilliant . I 'm not going back . Neither is he . I do have one question . It 's your nickel . Why ? Why do you do it ? Why the Centre ? Give and take . For a cause bigger than both of us . Oh , hell . I don 't expect you to understand it ... but in the end , it does all add up . You steal children . You create them . How does that add up ? Rape , incest , murder . Survival . Given enough incentive , man is capable of almost anything . [ Car Approaching ] It 's time to go . Dad . Now take care of your father . And of yourself . Thank you , Sydney . Come on , Dad . Jarod . I 'm glad you found your family . [ Car Rapidly Approaching ] - I told you . Sydney comes alone ! - Jarod , I had no choice . They 're planning to kill my father . - Who ? - [ Helicopter Approaching ] Daddy , get back ! - I 've got him . - Shoot him ! [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] - God , no ! - [ Jarod ] She 's losing a lot ofblood . Keep this compressed against the wound . [ Raines ] Forget Parker . Stop the plane ! Jarod , let 's go ! - You go ahead without me ! - Jarod . That boy needs a father . Now go ! We 'll catch up later ! I love you , Son ! I love you too , Dad . Go ! Go ! Go ! [ Jarod 's Voice ] I 've got to get her to the hospital . You 're not going anywhere . Looks like you 're out of luck . Now , you want to do this the easy way , or do you want to end up like her ? Stop him ! Welcome back to the Centre , Jarod . Angel , don 't leave me . Don 't leave me , angel .

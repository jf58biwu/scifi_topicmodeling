 This is the planet Earth ... It 's been devastated by a meteor shower ... Mello ... synchronize your mental consciousness with that star . Yes I can sense it . That planet is screaming out in distress ... from the pain of having its body and soul gouged out by a meteor . From the pain and shock of a sudden and violent form of evolution ... that was forced upon it . That is the planet where you will go . It will be a long journey ... Now , go ... Mello . After the Earth was severely devastated by the meteor 's impact ... there suddenly appeared a military regime , The Trader Force . The Trader Force quickly subjugated the entire world ... before it could fully recover from the impact of the meteor . The Earth was plummeted into a " dark age " ... under the regime of The Trader Force Are you all right ? Thank you . You were a big help , Daiba . It 's all because of this faulty lock . Whaddya mean ... ? It 's all because of that blasted Trader Force . The space ship is moving away . Everything 's okay now . Your injury seems to be healing . Thanks to this Doctor . I had nothing to do with it . Your power of recovery far exceed that of a normal human being . Now let 's discuss medical fees ... Not again , Doctor . This is the last of the premium sake left in the storeroom . Thanks , Daiba . Say ... I don 't need any more medical treatment . Hey , Moriki ! You emptied half of the bottle already . So what ! There 's no law that prohibits me from drinking . Hey , that 's enough ! Let me check that storeroom again . Stop your quibbling and bring me some more sake ! This is my sake ! Mother ! Father ! That was close ... Anybody here ... ? It 's all right ... I know that you have the strength to withstand it . Is this a trick ? Oh , no ... It is your inner strength . Mine ? Who are you ? My name is Mello . And your name is ? I am ... I am ... Fire-fighting operation concluded . Have confirmed impact of the meteor from an artificial orbit . There appears to be a young Japanese boy at the point of impact . Young boy ? Yes . We believe he is a high school student from the neighborhood . As expected , that lady probably did appear on Earth . Retrieve the young boy ! Are you awake now ? Where am I ? You 're in a Trader Force airborne carrier . You are to be escorted to the headquarters ... of the Far Eastern Command . What was that ? ! Now , just stay calm . You 've just been exposed to intense heat in the thousands of degrees . Come to think of it , that lady who was with me is one of you , right ? ! Lady ? What are you talking about ? Message from the Captain . Yes , this is the dispensary ... Emergency transmission ! Emergency transmission ! The young boy we retrieved , has just escaped ! Apprehend him immediately ! There he is ! You idiot ! What makes you think that an amateur like you ... can handle that fighter craft ? ! Seal the entrance ! C 'mon ! Move it ! Dammit ! You must try to remember ... Where are you ? This is only a machine that is using Earth 's technology . Come ... calm yourself and try to remember . The technology of Earth ... ? I remember ... There is no way you can escape . Come out quietly . There stern deck 's been hit ! Activate the enemy engagement system ! Can 't activate it in time ! What 's that ? ! We are now at cruising speed . Six ... now four seconds before he 's out of range . He 's an Ace pilot ! Auto pilot mode . Target area ... Tokyo , Nerima ward . Please respond ... Who are you ? How did I suddenly know how to fly this thing ? Maybe you don 't believe me , but . Huh ? How can I not believe you ! There 's a Trader Force spacecraft parked in the middle of my yard ! Never mind . We have a major problem Daiba . You 're now a target of the most powerful military regime on Earth . In my opinion , they are after your brain power . What am I to do ? No need to concern yourself , my young boy ! Now let 's see ... Hey , Moriki . There was no need to prop it up like that . Heave ho ! Much obliged ... I was never good at fixing things . What I consider as perfect ... always falls apart . What you just experienced , I believe ... is a regeneration of your DNA memory . Regeneration of DNA ? Well , you wouldn 't understand this theory anyway . Let 's depart . What 's this ? Shall we go ? Doctor ! Here , I am not a Doctor ! Call me Professor ! Professor ? ! Really ... he isn 't a drunk old man pretending to be someone else ! You 're looking at a genuine Professor . Ms. Moriki ! Welcome to the Shimaoka Research Center . Research Center ... ? Here , research is being centered on the meteor impact and its effects . Research is being done on a global scale . The Professor is attempting to make this the center for ... devising retaliatory measures against the Trader Force . But , I must admit that I haven 't devised anything yet ... to counteract their military dominance . Doctor ! Oh , excuse me ... Professor ! Why have you been so silent about this ? I never intended to involve a young boy like you in our fight ... But , it seems as if this " Center " will be needing your assistance . Trader Force spaceship approaching ! What did you say ? ! Heading directly for Nerima-ward ! Switch to main monitor ! The one who resisted us , Daiba Tetsuro . You will turn him over to us . If he is not placed in our custody within 30 minutes ... Yes sir ! 30 minutes ! If Daiba Tetsuro is not turned over within that time ... Tokyo will be a sea of fire . Why such a horrible ... Don 't do it , Daiba ! Damn it ! You could go , but it won 't solve anything ! Daiba ! Enemy aircraft sighted ! I believe it to be the aircraft that just escaped from us . Fire a few rounds at it . After it 's crippled , haul it in . Damn it ! Out of ammo . Energy missile approaching the underbelly of this ship ! It 's an electro-magnetic missile ! What ? ! How can this town have such a weapon ? I 'm detecting a cluster of major-class missile launchers . It 's no good ! We 're doomed ! We 're making an emergency landing on the water ! What a disaster ! This ship will splash down in Tokyo Bay . All crew members move to the forward block ! We did it ! Who are you ? I am Rei Yuki . You did ... this thing ? Uh huh ... Upon hearing that this area would be bombed ... I somehow just naturally , within my own mind ... devised a plan for this thing . Explain that again to me . You should know very well what I mean ... Aren 't you aware , that you also posses the same power ? Power ? Certainly ... Who are you ? Mello ... Why do you suddenly appear before us ? Why do you suddenly appear , and then disappear ? ! I am restricted in what I can accomplish on this planet . I can only be a guide ... to lead the new human race towards their rightful existence . A new human race ... And by that , of course , you mean us , right ? You will soon be meeting another friend , to add to your group . Together , you will ascend the stairway . Stairway ? Friend ? I don 't understand . Why pick us ? I 'm sure you must know the answer . Explain yourself ... And if you don 't ... You all right ? Where 's Mello ? She 's disappeared . Unbelievable ... Such a charming face ... and having the ability to create such a terrifying thing . Very similar to Daiba 's situation . She sensed the approaching crisis , and it activated her mental powers . To operate a spaceship and to create a cannon ? Both came from the same mental powers ? In both cases , an inner strength ... unknown to both individuals was activated . But I 'd like more case-studies of such a phenomenon to review . Daiba , your house is located here , in the Oizumi district , right ? This is Nerima-ward ... Daiba 's house is here ... Rei 's house is here ... And the meteor 's point of impact was here . This district was ground zero when the meteor hit ... and it was almost obliterated . With the exception of you two , there should be no other survivors . Then , these kids acquired this unique power ... as a result of that meteor blast ? But that is only my theory . But if it 's correct , other survivors from that same district ... could possibly possess the same powers as Daiba and his friend That 's what Mello told us ... That we could come in contact with other similar to us ... Friends who will have begun to ascend the same stairway . But that district was totally destroyed . There 's one possibility , an area that still remains untouched . The former military facility . It 's still intact . Fouton , a message from the Far East Military Headquarters . Let 's hear it . The operation was a complete failure . I am at a loss to express my apologies . I 've been informed that a young girl interfered . A young girl was observed ... manipulating the launch of an electro-magnetic missile . I understand . We must act immediately ... We must not let them fall into our enemy 's hands . Connect communication circuits with the usual living matter . Yes sir . This place was developed with two objectives ... First ... to develop weaponry under the veil of utmost secrecy . Second ... to build a shelter to protect Japan 's leaders in an emergency . But nobody had foreseen a meteor striking the Earth . Not one leader was able to find refuge here . Only weapons were saved . If there were no survivors , then what 's the purpose of coming here ? The other day , our sensors detected emissions ... from a living being somewhere inside here . There 's someone still alive inside here . According to the sensor , there 's a living body in that room ahead . Anybody here ? Hey , we 're friends ... come out . Something is strange . Wait ... Kitty cat ! Hey ! Ow ... ow ... ow . Oh my , you 're pretty scratched up , huh , Professor . This is ridiculous ! That beep on the sensor was only a cat ! ? Come here little kitty ... Why do we have to find the cat ? That cat is also a survivor , and is now one of us . The Earth ... That 's how it looked before the impact of the meteor . Nobody knows what it looks like after the impact . Wish I could see it . I wouldn 't care to see it . Either way ... there are no survivors here to join us . I doubt if there were any other survivors like us . There are still survivors . Mello ! How long do you intend to shadow us ? Until you decide on your own , which path you will choose . Our own path ? Your flesh and your souls are attempting to be set free ... from the shackles of this planet 's gravitational pull . What are you trying to tell us ? Are you ordering us to leave this planet ? That is the path you must select . Try to understand . You have already commenced to walk this path ... The meteor that struck the Earth , long ago , had grazed off my planet . It changed its course and headed for an impact with your Earth . Say that again ? ! My destiny is to revive the Earth that has been demolished ... by the meteor , and to restore it to its original state . You 're telling us that we are a hindrance to you ... But , you are nothing more than the instigator ... who brought about this disaster ! Daiba ! Isn 't that right ? It 's all because that meteor bounced off her world ... and changed course towards us ! And all because of that ... this Earth ... and my family ... Dammit ! Daiba ! Wait Daiba ! Do you believe everything she predicts ? I don 't know . But , if it 's true , I 'll leave my life to fate . What 's this ? What are these things ? Living matter . Daiba ! Rei ! Where could those two be ? Let me go ! What is this ? This ship is moving underground ? The mantle . This ship can maneuver through the Earth 's mantle ... Then what is this living matter ? It must be living matter that exists only ... inside the Earth 's mantle , right ? I welcome you ... representatives of the new human race . And I must apologize for forcibly taking you into custody ... by use of the mantle living matter . Who are you ? My name is Fouton . I am the Commander-in-Chief of The Trader Force . Furthermore , I am the one ... who will bring about the resurrection of the Earth . Resurrection ! ? Earth was struck by a meteor that bared malice towards the Earth ... The meteor displayed its will and intent to strike . What ! ? It was a display of its will and intent to curtail Earthlings ... from journeying into space and beyond the solar system ... which would bring about mankind 's advancement in evolution . Their objective is the total obliteration of the Earth ... and to annihilate the next step in mankind 's evolution . The meteor changed it 's course and headed for an impact with Earth . So then ... Mello must be ... Correct . She is the advance guard sent forward by the will of that meteor . And so that makes you ... ? I am the will and intent from another solar system . It is my destiny to render assistance to the people of Earth ... so that they may gain strength , against their oppressors . Which side are we to believe ? I believe Fouton more than Mello . Fouton is more logical and consistent . But in my efforts , it became necessary to utilize the strength ... of the Trader Force . However , I believe that with the cooperation of Earth people ... stability will be restored more peacefully . And the Earth will more quickly be able to regain its strength . What I need is someone to work with me . Come ... take my hand . What 's happening ? A rebellion by the mantle living matter . Subdue them ! It 's inconceivable that they have the power to oppose me ! It appears that someone is directing their attack ! They 're attacking as a group ! Human beings can 't control the living matter . Could it be that someone in your group is directing the rebellion ? ! No way ... Who are the others besides us ? You two just remain quiet while I crush this revolt . Escort these people to the room . Yes . I wonder if they are really friends ? If they are friends , then why is war being waged against Fouton ? Fouton , who is fighting for the benefit of Earth people ... Say ... don 't you feel something strange about this room ? It 's like a suffocating sensation , a strange feeling ... Electromagnetic shield ! Huh ? The energy is sealed inside by a powerful shield ! What is the reason for this ? Fouton is frightened ... of our powers ... ! ? That 's precisely correct ! But there 's no need to worry . The mantle living matter is presently in the process ... of destroying that shield . Who is there ? I hear it inside my head . Telepathy ? Mantle living matter . A pleasure to meet you , friends of the human race . It 's the cat . Then , it must 've been you who ... ? ! You may not want to believe this ... but my name is Mee and I am the third member of your group . Come ... Let 's go up to surface . This is the home territory of the mantle living masses . The interior of the mantle is their property . Can you communicate with the living mass ? Yes , remember that I am a living creature of evolution . As I thought , we 've been betrayed . Daiba and his friend committed no betrayal . It is you who betrayed Daiba ! Seize them ! Did you think I wouldn 't anticipate your revolt ? What ? I no longer have any desire to make use of you people ... That is because out of all the people born on Earth ... you two pose the greatest threat . It is my destiny to eliminate both of you . I bid you adieu , evolved Earthlings . Dammit ! You 've been lying to us all along What is that you 're holding in your hand ? What is that light ? Mello . Mello is ... inside my pendant ? My ability to transform into something tangible was limited . Therefore , I sealed my consciousness within this pendant . But now the seal has been broken ... in order to confront and oppose this devil from outer space . Fouton ! It 's useless ! You cannot hurt me , for I am a spiritual living substance . Fouton , you are the distorted will of the solar system ... who is attempting to twist the evolution of Earth ! You must suffer the consequences of your devilish will and intent ! A space vibration wave . Mello ! I always predict any and all encounters . Mello ! Incredible . Mello ! Mello ! I think she will be unconscious for a while , due to the shock . Let 's get out of this fortress ... before Fouton can call up her reinforcements . How do we get through the mantle ? We 'll use the mantle living mass ' ship . It 's impossible for a human being to operate that ship . True , for an ordinary human being . Fouton ! I will punish them for betraying me ! Assemble all the remaining troops ! But ... just minutes ago , they broke through our fortified defenses ... and the mantle ship has just ... You 're telling me that they escaped ? ! Yes ... We believe that the boy is piloting the ship . Unbelievable ! He can operate a ship belonging to a different species . Dispatch this message to all Trade Forces . Direct all squadrons to converge immediately in the air-space ... over Nerima-ward in Tokyo . When the meteor bounced off our planet and altered its course ... it picked up a certain substance that 's only on our planet . That substance is called DNA Sights . It is a substance that will accelerate and enhance evolution ... to all living matter it comes in contact with . Then , that is what brought about our transformation ? One of the effects of DNA Sights ... is to alter the time axis of DNA Memory ... so one can manipulate memories from the past , present and future . It 's a process that allows people born on our planet ... and propel themselves into outer space . So then , Daiba 's super human powers are DNA memories from the future . But wasn 't it the restoration of memories from the distant past ? Mello , if the meteor was an unintentional accident ... then we are a species that should not yet exist here on Earth ? The Earth still needs a few thousand years to regenerate . Presently , the Earth does not have the time or the resources ... to nurture living matter that has evolved to your current state . We 'll become a burden to the Earth ? In that case , why don 't you just leave the Earth ? Professor ! Just leave ? Sure ... Wasn 't it customary in the past that children leave home ... when they become a burden on their parents ? Parents don 't wish death upon their children ... no matter what kind of children they are ! But to depart into outer space is not a simple matter . Oh , for a cat , you sure do worry a lot , don 't you ? Daiba ... Let 's go to outer space ! Like you said , if that is to be my fate , then I will accept it . I wish to share my fate together with my newly acquired friends . That is the only way I can repay Earth for my planet 's sins ... Father ... Mother ... The Earth might regenerate itself , at the earliest ... within a few thousand years . A few thousand years from now ? Let 's depart . Power output is at 80 percent . It is amazing that this research center is actually a space ship . When did the professor start construction on this thing ? It is rumored that he started shortly after the meteor hit . Then it must 've been before we began to evolve . Perhaps it was something that he had possibly foreseen . Regardless of how it may have been beneficial for Daiba and his friends ... how is it going to affect us from here on ? It doesn 't matter , if research is needed to regenerate the Earth ... it can be carried out without a research center ... as long as I posses a brain . Okay then , but don 't let that mighty brain of yours ... get so soaked in alcohol that it becomes useless . All we ask is that you keep your eyes open . Ahhh ! Moriki ! Save some for me . Engine output at 120 percent . Main engine ignition ! The journey begins for our children . What 's that ? Look at the number of ships ! The Trader Forces ! It 's unfortunate , but I can 't allow Earthlings to depart for outer space . All ships ... commence firing ! Why are they attacking us ? They are the advance guards under Fouton 's command . The departure of Earth 's living matter into outer space ... means the birth of a new threat , that she desires to stop . This way ! I had this connected just earlier , while doing some maintenance work . Watch out ! The enemy ship is counter-attacking . Evolved living matter is aboard that ship . Disregard any minor damage that ship may cause us ! It 's no good . There 's no end to them . We 're just waiting to be destroyed ! Sir ... It 's the enemy flagship ! Main gun is ready to fire . The final blow against evolved living matter . Fire . Look ! What 's that ? ! It 's an Earth-style spaceship . Vessel classification unknown . Ship 's name is Arcadia . Impossible ... Direct hits to all ships . This ship is going down . It is unbelievable that I must retreat . Fouton , what are your orders ? As far as Earth matters are concerned , my assignment is over . I no longer have any use for you ! Lady Fouton ! There 's an escape capsule ! Fouton is trying to escape . Giving up , huh ? No doubt , she is returning to her star ... to replenish her store of energy . That ship , it 's coming along side of us . It 's here to escort us . But who are they ? They 're here to insure you have a safe journey . You might say they are your brothers and sisters . The spaceship has escaped Earth 's atmosphere . At last , their journey begins away from Mother Earth . So those in the spaceship will be the children of Earth . Right . They are the children who carry the destiny of the Earth . Open a line of communication ! It 's a telegram . From who ? " We wish you a safe journey . " They certainly use an old fashioned method of communication . A safe voyage , hmm ? I believe so . But this journey will also be a long one . Daiba and his friends have set out for the outer reaches of space . Mankind 's evolution and mankind 's history ... is now entering a new stage . To create a new chapter among the sea of stars . And what will be the result ? For now , no one knows .

 Amen . Amen . Amen . Get the tape . Get it . It 's in the back . Come on ! It 's all right . You don 't have to do this . No , I want to . Why are you doing this ? Come . His name was Isaac Luria . He lived in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn . Home to a sect of Hasidic Jews since the late 19th century . Also known for racial tension and hate crimes - Yankel Rosenbaum , Tawana Brawley ... Now Isaac Luria - murdered two days ago in the market that he owned . Severely beaten and shot five times at point-blank range . Police ruled out robbery cos the only thing that was missing was this videotape ... .. from the surveillance camera . Police found it early this morning . Where ? In the VCR of a 16-year-old named Tony Oliver . That 's him on the upper right . Has he been arrested ? No . Because he 's dead . He 'd been watching this tape when he was strangled . Very Old Testament . Yeah. but with a new twist . Brooklyn Homicide contacted the FBI 's civil rights branch ... .. with an interesting set of prints from the boy 's body . - Interesting how ? - They belonged to Isaac Luria . Risen from the grave to avenge his own death ? Some might assume that . It 's probably what someone would like us to think . - But you have your own idea . - I think that this is a crime of hatred ... .. like the crime that spawned it . A hatred that goes back 4,000 years . But masquerading as something else here . A callow attempt at murderous retribution ... .. disguised as spectral justice . - A resurrection hoax ? - And not a very good one . Yeah . Spectral figures are not often known to leave ﬁngerprints . Casper never did . Somehow the killer got hold of Isaac Luria 's fingerprints . And we have been asked to prove how . Excuse me , sir . We 're with the FBI . We 'd like to speak with Ariel Luria . - Is she home ? - I 'm Ariel 's father . Jacob Weiss . Why are you bothering her again ? She 's already spoken with the police . It 's all right . Let them in . Please. come in . Thank you . We can talk in the study . This is why you are here ? This is what you come to ask in this house of mourning ? What is this ? We 'd like your permission to reopen Isaac 's grave . No ! The answer 's no ! Why does this have to be done ? We 're looking for evidence in the murder of this young man . His name is Tony Oliver . He 's one of three suspects in your husband 's murder . We believe it was an attack of retaliation and that the other two suspects are targets . - He 's just a boy . - He 's an animal . A monster , like the others who killed Isaac . Whose grave you 're asking us to desecrate so you can protect them . Tate , please . But where were you when Isaac needed your protection ? When we called the police , they said that we were paranoid . That there was nothing to worry about . They always say that when someone threatens the Jews . So there was a threat of violence ? The threat is always there . Just this morning ... .. this is what I found under our door . And now you 've come here not to help us , ... .. but to ask our help so you can impose your justice ... .. on the only man who 's taken justice into his own hands . We 'd be happy not to disturb the grave if you could tell us who that man is . Even if I knew , why would I tell you ? Because this is a homicide investigation and you are required by law to assist us . I know all about your laws . I 'm afraid that even without your consent , we can get a court order to exhume Isaac 's grave . Do what you feel is necessary . But leave us alone . Let us mourn in peace . I have a feeling he knows who killed Tony Oliver . He doesn 't want us disturbing the grave because he knows what we 'll find . Maybe . But it 's hard to fault his attitude when you see something like that . Anybody delivering justice to a people who 've known that kind of hatred ... - .. who wouldn 't protect ' em ? - Justice or revenge ? I 'm not saying those kids don 't warrant prosecution , but the hate goes both ways . But the right to free expression doesn 't extend to murder . I bet whoever published that knows who killed Isaac Luria , ... .. and has a good idea who killed Tony Oliver too . Sure I knew him . He owned the store across the street . But I 'd be lying if I said I was surprised it happened . Why 's that ? Well , you know how they are . Always trying to find ways to make money off of honest folk who work for a living . Can you think of anyone who held a grudge ? - I can 't think of anyone who didn 't . - Did you ? Why ? I 'm not ... under any kind of suspicion , am I ? No , not directly , but these young men are . We have reason to believe you know them . Their names are Derek Banks and Clinton Macguire . I 'm sorry , I 'm not familiar with them . Well , are you familiar with this ? We think those kids are familiar with it . Enough to incite them to murder Isaac Luria . - You work for them too . - Who ? You know who . You look like you might be one yourself . We work for the FBI , sir . Who 's the FBI work for ? That 's right . You call me paranoid , cos that 's exactly what they want you to do . But there is one thing you can 't call me and that is a Zionist collaborator . You take a long look at these photos . It may be your last chance to save their lives . One of their accomplices ... .. Tony Oliver , was found murdered this morning . - Why tell me this ? - You haven 't heard the rumours ? - What rumours ? - That Luria is back from the dead . That he 's risen from his grave . What kind of Jew trick is this ? A Jew pulled it off 2,000 years ago . We 're just relating the evidence , sir . You can draw your own conclusions . But I know you wouldn 't want to be responsible for ... .. endangering these young men 's lives . Bless you . Derek ? You sure about this ? I heard them , man . I 'm not waiting around to ﬁnd out if it 's true . Damn ! - What 's wrong ? - It 's nailed shut . There 's some tools in the trunk . I got it open , man ! Get down here ! Hey , Clinton . Check it out . Clinton ! Hey , Clinton . Check it out . Clinton ? You trying to mess with me ? Oh , man . The ligature marks on the victim 's neck are consistent with our vigilante 's MO . Forensics come up with anything ? A second set of footprints . but the mud was too soft to take a mould . My guess is Clinton was here with Derek Banks . Looking for what ? Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse as retribution for Tony Oliver 's death . Seems pretty redundant . Messing up somebody you 've already killed ? I think they came here because they were afraid . Afraid ? Afraid that the man they hated enough to kill wasn 't really dead . Look . There goes your theory of how Luria 's prints got onto the victim 's body . What does that look like to you ? The body wasn 't embalmed , as according to custom . Maybe it 's postmortem lividity or some kind of tattooing . It 's hard to tell at this stage of decomposition . What 's this ? A little bedtime reading ? - You owe me for two weeks . - Where have you been ? Is it true ? You and your friends killed the Jew ? Just give me my money . What the hell were you thinking ? I never told you to kill anyone . No ? What did you expect me to do ? Hide back here like you , licking envelopes in the dark , calling them names ? We 're working to spread the truth . The truth ? You 're as pathetic as they are . I am exposing their lies . Man , those are just words . You think they killed my friends with words ? That 's right . Clinton 's dead too . Now I 'd like my money . It 's called the Safer Yezirah , the Book of Creation . The earliest known Hebrew text on man 's mystical communion with the divine . - Is it ever buried with the dead ? - No . In observance with the Jewish belief , the corpse is buried only in its shroud . No personal symbols of class or worldly position are allowed . Has it ever been known to spontaneously combust ? Uh , no . No , it hasn 't . It 's a book on mysticism , not mysticism itself . Is it printed on special paper or with special ink ? No , it 's just a book . Leather and paper . I suspect somebody 's playing a trick on you . Possibly moisture may have Ieeched into the coffin , ... .. into the binding and the pages of the book . If the groundwater was contaminated , arsine gas could 've created a combustible mixture . Is there anything that distinguishes this particular Safer Yezirah from other books ? Yes , but it 's barely legible because of the burning . It 's a name engraved in the leather , or stamped into the leather . - A name ? - Yes , a Hebrew name . Weiss . Jacob Weiss . Jacob Weiss . - Why do you want to see him ? - There 's been another murder . Another suspect in your husband 's death was found dead last night . - Where was this ? - Next to your husband 's grave . How does this concern my father ? He expressed strong feelings towards this victim , He was angry . They were angry words . And we found evidence placing him at the crime scene . This is escalating into something else , Ariel . Something that has to stop . My marriage to Isaac ... You have to understand how much it would have meant to my father . " Would have meant " ? We got our marriage license a few weeks ago , but the wedding wasn 't until today . I 'm sorry . I 'd like to show you something . It was a communal wedding ring made in Kolin , a village near Prague . My father was an apprentice to the man who designed it . - It 's beautiful . - Mm-hmm . Every woman who got married in the synagogue wore this ring as a symbol that ... .. she was a queen , ... .. her husband a king , ... .. and the home they made a castle , not only on their wedding day , ... .. but for the rest of their lives together . But most of those lives ended in one day in the spring of 1943 . 9.000 Jews were massacred after digging their own graves . But your father survived . Because he was ten years old and he was a jeweler 's apprentice . He had small ﬁngers to make bullets at a munitions factory . And through all this he hid the ring ? Even after the war , he hid it . Even from my mother . Why ? Because to him it was a dead relic from a forgotten place . Until the day that I told him I was getting married . And for the first time in 50 years , he took out this ring . He said he felt his village was born again . He knew how much I loved Isaac . Ariel , tell us where your father is . I know my father . He would never kill anyone . What if you 're wrong ? Do you see him ? - I 'm sorry . We don 't mean any disrespect . - Who are you ? We 're looking for Jacob Weiss . Why ? Mulder . Don 't move ! Federal agent ! You OK , Mulder ? Yeah . Put your hands in the air where I can see them . And turn around slowly . I got him , Scully . Mr Weiss , we 're placing you under arrest . Come on . Let 's go . Where is he ? Where 's my father ? We 've arrested him , Ariel , under suspicion of murder . I don 't believe you . It can 't be him . Did he ... Did he tell you he killed this person ? I think that 's the direction it 's going . Agent Mulder 's with him now . I need to see him . - Ariel , I suggest you get him an attorney . - I need to see him ! 0K . Ask Detective Bartley down the hall . He 'll give you a place to wait until your fathers been processed . Ariel ... I 'm sorry . Why 'd you kill him , Jacob ? Our synagogue has been vandalized 13 times in the last year . I heard a noise in the attic . I went up to see what it was and he attacked me . It was self-defense . - Hanging a man in self-defense ? - Is it worse than what they did to Isaac ? Is it any better ? They found your book , your Sefer Yezirah in Isaac Luria 's grave . - So ? - That puts you at a second crime scene . I 'm guilty . What more do you want ? - The truth . - I have given you the truth ! There was someone else in that attic with you . Who was it ? There was no one else . Then you 're a liar . And you know nothing about nothing . And I have no more to say about this . I would like to see my daughter . Wanna see the background check I ran on him ? He emigrated to Israel after WWII and joined the Irgun - the Jewish military underground . He was arrested in 1959 by the British for a bombing that killed seven civilians . He was a terrorist , Mulder . A killer . Not our killer though . He just confessed . I stood here and listened . I think there was a second person in that attic . Weiss is protecting whoever it is . Who ? His daughter ? It was somebody strong enough to knock me down . Well , who do you think it was ? Stick around . This could be interesting . - Where are you going ? - To see a man about a burning book . They say you confessed . - Why are you doing this ? - To protect you . - From what ? - I think you know . They found my book in Isaac 's grave . - It can 't be true . - No ? There 's something you didn 't tell me ... .. about the contents of this Sefer Yezirah . - What is it you want to know ? - The myth of the golem . I told you , Mr Mulder . This is a mystical text . These pages are ﬁlled with golems and dybbuks and demons of all sizes and shapes . It 's the golem I 'm interested in . I 'm interested in why an FBI agent would be so interested in such a thing . That 's what I was hoping you could tell me . The early cabalists ... .. believed a righteous man could actually create a living being from the earth itself . Fashioned from mud or clay . But this creature could only be brought to life by the power of the word . In practical terms , ... .. by a direct application of certain secret letter-combinations . Combinations found in that book ? See ? These pages . They 're basically instructions for animating the inanimate . And this ... Yeah , this passage here ... .. talks about inscribing a single word on the golem itself . - 0n the back of his hand ? - I 'm impressed . - What is the magic word ? - Emet . See , these three letters ... .. alef , mem , tav , ... .. creates the word " emet " . I don 't know what that means . Truth . " Emet " means " truth " . But you see , ... .. Mr Mulder , therein lies the paradox . Because the danger of the truth is contained in the word " golem " itself , ... .. which means " matter without form , body without soul " . So the golem is an imperfect creation . A kind of monster , really . Unable to speak or feel anything ... .. but the most primitive emotions . In the legends , it runs amok ... and has to be destroyed by its creator . Destroyed how ? By erasing ... .. the ﬁrst letter , alef , ... .. " emet " becomes " met " , ... .. which means " dead " . Again , Mr Mulder , ... .. the power of letters . Not just to create , but to kill . - Yeah ? - Mulder , there 's been another homicide . Who ? Curt Brunjes . I 'm on my way to the print shop . I 'll be there in ten minutes . A man on a mission . Look at all the energy he spent spreading his hatred . He wasn 't toiling in obscurity . This mailing list has hundreds of names , including our murder victims . At least we know Jacob Weiss didn 't kill them . I 'll have him released . Agent Scully ? The image is fuzzy , but I think we 've got a hit . - There . - Oh , my God . It 's Isaac Luria . He 's still alive . I 'm not so sure about that . No , thank you . That won 't be necessary . The coroner matched Luria 's dental records . It was his corpse that was in that grave . You know , this videotape , it must have been altered somehow . Planted by whoever is staging this hoax . It 's not a hoax , Scully . It never was . - But if Luria is dead ... - This is not Luria . Not really . Who do you think it is ? Some kind of ghost ? No , a ghost is spirit without form . But I believe what we 're looking for and what we 're seeing here is form without spirit . - Something called a golem . - A golem ? Yeah , it 's a kind of a man made monster described in Jewish folklore . It 's fashioned from mud and then animated through mystical incantation . Mud ? Mulder , what are you talking about ? And for what purpose ? Exacting revenge ? I don 't think it was hate that created this golem , Scully . I think it was love . Ariel , it 's Agent Mulder . Open the door . It 's not locked . Ariel ? She 's not here , Scully . How do you know ? Because it 's her wedding day . Ariel ? I know you 're here . I know you can hear me . Ariel ? Leave us alone , Tate . You don 't belong here . - I 'm your father . - Please go . Not without you . I 'm not leaving without you . - I want to see him . - He 's dead . Isaac is dead . No ! The boys that killed him , their hate took him from you , ... .. and you tried bringing him back with your love . But what you brought back , ... .. you have to understand , Ariel , ... .. it isn 't him . It 's an abomination . It has no place among the living . He said he 'd call me back , Tate . We were talking on the phone ... .. about the wedding . Isaac said he had to go . That a customer needed him , and that he would call me back . But when I heard the phone ring later , something told me not to pick it up . A woman 's voice was on the line . I didn 't hear what she was saying . I didn 't have to . I knew Isaac wasn 't calling me back . I was just wanted to say good-bye , Tate . I know . I know . I didn 't think . It was just a wish . They were just ... .. words . - Stay here . - I want to go with you . - No . - Tate ! No ! Wait , I got a knife . - His pulse is thready . - Will he be OK ? - If we get him to a hospital . - Call the paramedics . - Where are you going ? - To find Ariel . Ariel ? We found your father . He 's alive . He 's gonna be OK . I know about Isaac . Where is he ? I don 't know . OK . We 've gotta get out of here . No . - Come on , Ariel . Let 's go . - No . We have to go . Come on , Ariel . Come on . Isaac ? - Stop or I 'll ﬁre ! - No ! No ! No ! Stop ! No . Isaac ! lam to my beloved ... .. as my beloved is to me . I loved you . Mulder ? Are you OK ? I heard shots fired . What happened ? What is she doing ? Saying good-bye . I made this !

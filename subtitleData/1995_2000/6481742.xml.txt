 Three . Give me two . Two . Can I have five cards , please ? Five ? What , are you serious ? Four is the limit . Let 's see your ace . If Mr. Weems wants five ... give him five . Dealer takes two . Four . Nah . How much is that ? Four grand keeps you in . You and your five shiny new cards . There 's $ 4,000 and four more . Let 's make this interesting . I 'm raising you 15 large . I wouldn 't do that . This is all I need . You 're going to need Depends after you see this hand . Now we show each other our cards ? Four kings . That 's a straight flush , right ? Beginner 's luck . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Going home . No , no . Not so fast . We expect a chance to win some of our money back . Guys , there 's over $ 100,000 here . You 're damn right there 's over $ 100,000 there . $ 100,000 is all I need . Sorry . I had fun , though . Where can I cash out ? Guys , I think we 're going up instead of down . Guys ? Guys , this is not what I meant by " cashing out " ! Hey ! Hey ! Hello . Hey , Mulder , it 's me . What now ? Are you in Chicago ? Yes , I 'm in Chicago . I 'm on the northeast corner of 7th and Hunter , just liked you asked . Only , you 're not here . So where are you ? Oh , around . Yeah . Hey , nice outfit . Hey . What 's down there ? Well , before you check out down there , check out up there . Top two floors are leased to one Jimmy Cutrona , whose name you might be familiar with . Organized crime . The Bureau 's been trying to build a racketeering case against him for the past few years . Gambling , extortion , murder . Which is why last night there were two agents parked across the street in surveillance . They witnessed a man being thrown from Cutrona 's roof at 10 : 40 p.m. This man fell 30 floors , plus the distance down this shaft , because these doors just happened to be open ... straight through , nothing but net . Ouch . I 'm guessing that 's what he said . After he got up , climbed out of here and scampered off into the night . Mulder , you keep saying " this man . " Who is this man ? No idea . He got away . The agents gave chase , but no clear description . Was this basement thoroughly searched ? No . Technically , falling 300 feet and surviving isn 't a crime . And your theory is ? What if this man had some kind of special capability ? Some kind of genetic predisposition towards rapid healing or tissue regeneration ? So , basically , what if we were looking for Wile E. Coyote ? You 're saying that he is invulnerable , right ? Uh ... You know , in 1998 , there was a British soldier who plummeted 4,500 feet when his parachute failed , and he walked away with a broken rib . What 's your point ? My point is that if there 's a wind gust , or a sudden updraft , and , plus , if he landed in exactly the right way ... I mean , I don 't know . Maybe he just got lucky . What if he got really , really lucky ? That 's your big scientific explanation , Scully ? I mean , how many thousands of variables would have to convene in just the right mixture for that theory to hold water ? I don 't know . Well , thousands . - Mulder ? - Yeah ? Look at this . If this cart were on the platform when he hit , that would explain the condition of these wheels . And what if this whole thing had just enough give to save his life ? We 'd have to find him to ask . Yeah , we have to find him . Looks like maybe we found part of him already . Think you 're taking a flier here , Mulder . There 's got to be at least 600 people with prosthetic eyes in the greater Chicago area . Yeah , but only this one Henry Weems made an appointment this morning to get a new one . Maybe he can 't see his way to the door . Come on , Scully . I 'm feeling lucky . Can you help me ? It 's an emergency . - Ma 'am , we 're not plumbers . - I didn 't say you were . I just want the damn water turned off so that I can go to work . Look , you got to be stronger than me , right ? Valve 's under the sink . Your building super ... Henry Weems ... he isn 't around ? Mr. Dependable ? Might as well wait for Jimmy Hoffa to show up . You 're turning it the wrong way . Hey , Richie , sweetheart , back in bed . But , Mom ... " Buts " are for sitting , and I want yours back in bed . He 's right . Clockwise . I know that . Clockwise . You okay , Mulder ? Yeah , it 's all right . My ass broke the fall . Guess who I found . Henry Weems , I presume ? Next time , leave the plumbing to a professional . Oh , uh ... Oh , um ... want to try this on for size , Cinderella ? Mr. Weems , why were you hiding in a vacant apartment ? Not hiding ... avoiding . Avoiding whom ? You people . Now that you found me , let 's just get it over with . No way am I testifying against Jimmy Cutrona . Last night , Cutrona had you thrown off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue ... is that correct ? You didn 't hear it from me . I 'm not letting you people move me to Muncie , Indiana , to milk cows . More to the point , you survived a , uh ... 300-foot fall essentially un ... harmed . I don 't know . Maybe ... the wind was just right , and I landed on a bunch of towels ... no biggie . You got lucky ? Yeah , I guess , except ... you should look at my bruise . Oh . Plus , I didn 't get to keep my poker winnings . So that 's what you were doing there last night ... playing poker ? Cutrona thought I was cheating . I wasn 't . But like I said , you didn 't hear it from me . Must have been a high - stakes game , I imagine . Did you win a lot of money ? I don 't know ... a little . What is that ? Did you make it ? Uh-huh . Sort of a hobby . Mm-hmm . Mind if I ... ? Ah . That 's craftsmanship . What does it mean ? What do you mean , " What does it mean ? " Yeah , what 's-what 's ... It doesn 't mean anything . I just sort of ... I don 't know . It 's cause and effect . So , are-are we done here ? Mr. Weems , can I ask you to reconsider testifying against Cutrona ? Nope . No way , Jose . Well , it would be in your best interest . He 's tried to kill you once , and he will undoubtedly do it again . Yeah , we can protect you . I 'll take my chances . So , here 's the plan , as I see it : we inform the Chicago field office about Weems , leaving it to them to secure his testimony , you change your clothes , we fly back to D.C. by sunset , and all is right with the world . Come on , Scully , you 're going to dump this case just as it 's getting interesting . " Interesting , " Mulder , was when we were looking for Wile E. Coyote . Come on , Mulder , this guy just got lucky . There 's no X File here . Maybe his luck is the X File . Stairs . Oh ... Car keys . Must have lost them when I fell . So , you get many of these ? So , uh , we 've searched the entire building , and there 's no sign of Henry Weems . I 'm guessing that he 's on the run . Our dead man 's name is Angelo Bellini , aka Angie the Animal . He 's an enforcer for the Cutrona family , and I don 't think his visit was friendly . You think that Weems could have killed him in self-defense ? Skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nicknamed " The Animal " ? I don 't think so . You and I both know Weems didn 't kill anybody . Besides , we were just gone for two minutes . This guy doesn 't have a scratch on him . I 'm thinking it was a heart attack . What the hell happened here , Mulder ? Cause and effect . Meaning ? Okay , so ... watch . So Bellini kicks down the door ... wah ! ... poised to kill Weems , right ? But just as he 's about to pull the trigger , a noise startles him . The buzzer ... when I buzzed to be let back in the apartment . So when he does pull the trigger , his aim is off , right ? And he hits the lamp , which falls over and knocks over the ironing board , so as the bullet ricochets , Weems dives over the sofa . Now , when Bellini goes for him , he trips over the ironing board , bounces off the chair , flips end over end and his shoelace gets caught in the fan ... QED . Cause and effect . Seemingly unrelated and unconnected events and occurrences that appear unrelated and random beforehand , but which seem to chain react in Henry Weems 's favor . Dumb luck ? Yeah , he seems to have tapped into it somehow . He-he won big at poker , he-he survived getting thrown off a skyscraper , and now this . Hang on a second . Okay . Hey . Your name 's Richie , right ? - Yeah . - I 'm Dana . Hi . Why don 't we , uh , head back to your room ? I 'm sure that 's what your mom would want . So I 'm guessing you 're a sports fan . Which one 's your favorite ? Well , it used to be basketball . But now the Bulls suck , so I think maybe baseball . I like baseball , too . Did Henry make this for you ? That 's pretty neat . Yeah . He made it for me when I was in the hospital . He said ... it 's ' cause ... everything happens for a reason . Only , just sometimes it 's hard for us to see . You went to the hospital because of your liver ? It doesn 't work so good . Police looking for Henry ? Yeah . They just want to talk to him . Do you have any idea where he might have gone ? Mm-mm . Since I got sick , he hardly ever goes out . Boy give you any leads ? He knows nothing . Mulder , as to your theory ... Mm-hmm ? ... why would the world 's most supernaturally lucky man work as a building superintendent ? I mean , why doesn 't he just run down to the Illinois State Lottery , enter , and , you know , he 'd win automatically ? How you feeling , pal ? I 'm okay . The police are looking for you , though . How come ? Uh ... you know ... you do folks a favor , wire the joint for free cable ... Don 't worry about it . You going to be okay by yourself for a while ? Where you going ? Something I got to do I 've been putting off . You get some rest . That 's it ? Got nothing else ? Okay . Thank you . Henry Weems has no police record , I assume ? He has no record of any kind , Mulder . He doesn 't earn enough in a year to file tax returns . He has no savings account , no checking account , no insurance . Doesn 't even have a video rental card , for that matter . He doesn 't even have a driver 's license . I mean , it 's like he 's intentionally stayed off the radar . He 's retired from the world . Ever since December 1989 . When a commuter jet crashed into Lake Michigan carrying 21 passengers . - There was one survivor . - Henry . Yeah . That 's how he lost his eye . Snowy night , Christmas rush . He 'd been bumped from three previous flights before they finally found a seat for him on that fateful plane . Guess what seat number . 13 ? On Flight 7 . More good luck , you 're saying ? Call it good or bad , but maybe that 's where it all started . What if a brand-new Henry Weems was plucked from the wreckage ? One whose fortunes had been irrevocably , permanently changed ? Before 1989 , Henry held down a job for nine years at a train yard , but after the accident , as you said , it 's like he just disappeared off the face of the earth . He severed ties with all his friends and moved out to Melrose Park . Mulder , there are millions of reasons for that , including survivor 's guilt . I mean , what doesn 't track for me is why Henry Weems would drop off the map just because he suddenly became incredibly lucky . What doesn 't track for me is why he 's resurfaced after all these years ... why he 's suddenly decided to use his luck in this way . All right , take care of yourself , brother . Later . Hey , what 's the lottery up to ? $ 28 million . I don 't need that much . You don 't need that much . How much do you need , Rockefeller ? More like 100 grand . Here goes . One dollar . These suck . Police have confirmed that a Melrose Park building superintendent is wanted for questioning in a case some sources term an unusually vicious gangland slaying . You did it ! You won 100 grand ! Where do I collect the money ? Man , they 'll mail it to you ! $ 8,200 a month for 12 months ! Yeah ! That 's too long . No , please . I wouldn 't do that . Oh , baby . Oh , sweet baby ! Anything in the trash can is the store 's property . Yeah , right . In your face . No , just throw it away . Something bad is going to happen . So long , suckers . I did it ! I won ! I won the lottery ! 100 grand , fools ! 100 grand ! On three . One , two , three . So , let me get this straight . This is the man who initially won the money ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And once you and he ascertained that the accident victim was still alive , this man fled on foot ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Afterwards , the man who was hit by the truck handed you the lottery card , and said ... " Maurice , I want you to have this . " Mm-hmm . Thank you , Mr. Albert . I think that will be all . Thank you . For such a fortunate man , a lot of unfortunate things happen in Henry Weems ' wake . Maybe that 's part of the package . Can 't have one without the other . So , Mulder , Henry Weems came here to buy a lottery ticket . Why ? Maybe it 's like you said . Why wouldn 't the luckiest man in the world enter the lottery ? Actually , that 's exactly what you said about an hour after you said it . Well , he 's not in his place and he 's not with Richie . You think he hid in there ? He doesn 't hide , he avoids . Pretty damn well , I 'd say . That thing must go all over the building , Mulder . I 'll start with the roof , if you want to start with the basement . Hey ! Hey ! Watch the rough stuff . Henry Weems , you 're a hard man to track down . - I 'm working here ! - Oh ? You and I are going to have a talk . You just sit right here and don 't move , okay ? Tough guy . Oh , crap . Not again . Let 's get him up to O.R. 40 . Coming through . Excuse us . Does it hurt ? Stings a bit . But I 'll live . Come over here , Henry . I want to try something . What 's that about ? I haven 't a clue . Nine of clubs . You go . What for ? I think you know . Uh , you win . Double or nothing . Whoo-hoo ! Tough to beat . You win again . Mulder , what does that prove ? Think it proves that if we played this 10,000 times in a row , he would win 10,000 times in a row . He 's incapable of losing . How does it feel to be the luckiest man in the universe , Henry ? It 's a nightmare . You have no idea . No , no , I do . 'Cause ... ' cause when you get lucky ... really , really lucky ... people around you tend to suffer . Is that right ? I think it 's a balance thing . Something good happens to me , and everybody else has to take it in the keister . So you 've stayed close to home mostly , kept a low profile , but recently you 've been venturing out a little further . You played poker with those mobsters . I figured they could stand the trimming . Bunch of goombah jerks . They got issues , man . You don 't mind so much if a few criminals get hurt , but then you went and you played the lottery . I knew I shouldn 't have done that . I needed the money . For what ? For Richie , right ? It 's the complications from his hepatitis . He 's on every donor list they got , but he 's got a rare blood type ... B-negative . And he 's CN ... something . CMV negative . Cytomegalovirus . There 's no way they 're going to find a donor in time . There 's a treatment program in England . 100 grand gets him in . It 's experimental , but it 's the best chance he 's got now . Am I under arrest ? No . However , you will need protection from Cutrona and his men . I 'd say they need protection from me . I 'm sorry , Mulder . That was utterly irresponsible . You 're feeding the delusions of a man who has had three attempts made upon his life . You 're supposed to be talking him into protective custody , not out of it . I 'd agree with you if I thought his life was in danger . As it is , he 's doing a better job on Cutrona 's organization than the FBI . I 'm wondering if we shouldn 't make him an honorary agent . Mulder , you 're putting an astounding amount of faith in coincidence and luck . Essentially , you 're betting a man 's life on it . And even if you believe in so-called lucky streaks , you have to know they all eventually end . Luckiest man in the world ? Hell , Mulder , I just beat him . Mulder ? Come on , Scully . Henry ! You 're supposed to be resting . I am resting . Playing on the floor doesn 't count . Don 't you ever get tired of this thing ? Henry said it 's educational . Yeah , well , I don 't want you believing everything that Henry says . Did you know the police are looking for him ? Henry said it 's no big deal . When did you see ... ? Mom , what 's wrong ? How 's he doing ? Well , he 's got a bruised rib and a black eye . It certainly could have been worse . And don 't tell me he just got lucky . Far from it . Maybe what you said about streaks is right . Looks like his has just about run its course . I don 't mean to make light of his misfortune , but it may have knocked some sense into his head . He 's agreed to testify against Cutrona . What ? Our guy from the Justice Department just called . They 're filing a federal warrant this afternoon . This mook Weems ... This mook Weems was street pizza last I heard from you . He was . I don 't know what it is . Maybe he has some special ability . He 's impervious or something . Anyway , we can 't get to him . They got cops all over the hospital . Who says we have to get to him ? I want the toy Henry made me , Mom . Can you please go get it ? Uh , sure , honey . We got to go . All right , Richie , I will bring it and I will follow you there . I will meet you at the hospital , okay ? Mm . Did you find her ? No . You know Cutrona took her . He did it to keep me from testifying . And he 's who we 're focused on , but there 's no sign of a kidnapping , there 's no ransom note . He 's too smart for that . Which makes it very hard for us to obtain a search warrant . We 'll get one , though . When ? Tomorrow ? Next week ? Could someone sit with him at least ? Hold up , Henry . Henry , what if ... what if what I said before wasn 't true ? That your luck hasn 't changed ? Maybe all this is happening for a reason . So you 're saying that Maggie getting taken is a good thing ? No , I 'm saying that what looks like it might be bad luck may not be bad luck , but we can 't tell yet . We 're not in that position . We can 't see the forest for the trees . How is he ? Not good . If we don 't find a donor in the next few hours ... Scully , what if everybody that becomes involved in Henry Weems 's life somehow becomes an integral part of his luck , including you and I ? Mulder , you 're speaking as if we 're all trapped in one of those contraptions that he builds . What are you doing ? Looking for Maggie Lupone . Luck is the overreaching force in this investigation . I say we roll with it . Yeah , let 's call that a dry run . Yeah . Look who came calling . I wanted to tell you personally that there 's no hard feelings . I 'm not testifying against you . Just let Maggie Lupone go . " Maggie " ? I don 't know anybody named Maggie . You know anybody named Maggie ? Fellas , don 't jerk me around . Jerk you around ? You tried to cheat me out of a hundred large , you kill Angie , you put Sal in the hospital ... I 'm jerking you around ? I apologize for my choice of words . Please , just let her go . Her kid 's really sick . I don 't care what happens to me . You 'll care . By the time I 'm finished , you 'll definitely care . Henry ? Richie ... how is he ? Not that one . Use the small one . Hey . Henry ... Don 't you hurt him , you son of a bitch ! Shut her up . Henry ! Ooh . What are the odds for Cutrona being a perfect match ? Thousand-to-one ? Million-to-one ? Maybe higher . Maybe everything does happen for a reason whether we see it or not . Maybe your luck is changing . Maybe . I made this !

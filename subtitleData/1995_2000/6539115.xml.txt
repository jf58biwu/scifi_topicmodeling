 Here . Try this screen . Concentrate on this area over here . Right there . Mulder ! What 's going on ? I 'm not sure I can explain . You called for a forensic excavation at 5 a.m. on a Sunday ? Just give me a minute , OK ? What are you doing out here ? I keep having this dream . It 's about a little blonde girl . You 're here because of something you saw in a dream ? Sir ! Carefully remove all that . Easy . Tell me about this dream . I 've had flashes of it three nights in a row , ... .. and last night it went on long enough to lead me right to her . - I need the chest exposed . - Yes , sir . It just takes a little time . Sir ? Let us do that . If you destroy evidence , we may never know what happened . I know what happened . She was strangled . He used an eight-gauge electrical cord . He took something from the body postmortem - a trophy , ... .. a piece of fabric cut from her clothes in the shape of a heart . - You got all these details from your dream ? - No . I know this MO from memory . - Whose MO ? - John Lee Roche . He killed 13 eight - to ten-year-old girls . This makes 14 . It was a difficult case . He was extremely hard to catch . By 1990 , ten victims had been found , scattered across the Eastern seaboard . The earliest dated back to 1979 . VICAP named the case " Paper Hearts " because of the trophies the killer took . All the victims were abducted from their homes . Reggie Purdue brought me in because he thought I could get inside the killer 's head . Did you ? I concluded we were looking for a salesman . Someone who traveled a lot , who could gain people 's confidence , someone ordinary . Roche was a vacuum cleaner salesman . His job took him all over the Northeast . He 'd be in someone 's home , ... .. demonstrating his vacuum , and he 'd be checking out their kids . He 'd choose a victim and come back for her months later . But it was your profile that caught him . What about the trophies he took , the cloth hearts ? We never found them , but we had him on 13 counts of murder . He admitted to 13 . Polygraph said he was telling the truth , but it always bugged me . I always wanted to find those hearts and count them , see if they really added up to 13 . I guess they didn 't . If nothing else , I think I can at least help explain your dream . I don 't think you ever stopped thinking about this case . I believe you solved it in your sleep . You think that I 've had this information about a 14th victim all the time ... .. and I 've been processing it unconsciously ? You said it yourself once . .. a dream is an answer to a question we haven 't learned how to ask . You did good work , Mulder . Let 's identify this girl so we can put her to rest . I believe her name is Addie Sparks . She went missing from her home in Pennsylvania , in June 1975 . I contacted the Center for Missing and Exploited Children , ... - .. ran a search through the database . - 1975 's too early . I think the match is right . The height is right ; the description of the sleeper is right . That would mean Roche started way before we thought he did . Mulder , we 're gonna have to verify this . Are you up for that ? - Frank Sparks ? - Can I help you ? Yes . I 'm Agent Scully . This is Agent Mulder . We 're with the FBI . May we speak with you ? You 've found Addie . This was for the tooth fairy . When Addie was asleep at night , I 'd come and put a quarter in this pocket . Her mother sewed it . - Where is your wife , sir ? - She passed away last summer . So you , uh ... you 're saying the man that did this is already in prison ? Yes , sir , and he won 't get out . You do this full-time , telling people ... this kind of news ? No , sir , not full-time . - It 's not a good job . - No . I used to think ... .. that missing was worse than dead because " . .. you never knew what happened . But now that I know , ... .. I 'm glad my wife 's not here . She got luckier . How many more people , uh ... like me ... - .. are you gonna visit today ? - Sir ? Were there other victims you didn 't know about ? Roche 's car . Roche drove a white El Camino . - I saw it in my dream . - What are you saying ? The cloth hearts , he would have wanted them close . For a traveling salesman , that means inside the car . You 're saying the hearts might still be in his car ? He doesn 't have them in prison . His cell is searched regularly . His mail is examined . His car was sold at auction in 1992 , put beyond his reach . It 's worth a look . We gotta find those hearts , to count them . Don 't you think the car 's been searched already ? Not by me . Here it is . I 've been , you know , detailing it . Dropped the bed shell and did the decals , stuff like that . - Thank you . - Honest-to-God serial killer owned my car ? For real ? I 'm helping him detail . - Something 's wrong here , Scully . - Maybe it 's underneath . Mad Hat . Hey , Scully , the camper shell . The kid said he took the camper shell off . " Mad Hat . " Mad Hatter . Eight , ... .. nine , ten , ... .. eleven , ... .. twelve , thirteen , ... .. fourteen ... Addie Sparks ! Fifteen , ... .. sixteen . He killed two more victims . Mulder . Long time no see . You got a new partner . Agent Scully . - So what 's up ? - We found Addie Sparks , John . Congratulations , I guess . We also found your cloth hearts , ... .. all16 of them . - Oh . - Sixteen victims , John . How come you said there were only 13 ? I don 't know . 13 sounds more magical , you know ? Tell us about the last two victims . You 're in for life . You 've got nothing to lose . I got nothin ' to gain . You can gain one moment of decency in your life . You can finally let those families put their daughters to rest . I understand you take this very personally , Mulder . How about this ? Sink one from there , and I 'll tell you . You 'd trust a child molester ? You bring my hearts and give them back to me , ... .. I 'll tell you everything you wanna know . Coming out . .. President Nixon and HR Haldeman while transcribing the subpoenaed tape . Woods testiﬁed that she erased about five minutes of the conversation , ... - .. but the tape contained ... - Fox , it 's your move . Under investigation from Senator Howard Baker , ... .. HR Haldeman reiterated the White House explanation that ... - Samantha . - Are you gonna move or not ? - Do we have to watch this ? - .. hitting the record button . It would be very difﬁcult to reach the conclusion it was an accident . The magician comes on at nine . Mom and Dad said I could watch the movie , buttmunch . They 're next door at the Galbrands ' . They left me in charge . No ! Not again . Samantha , run ! Fox ! Fox ! Samantha ! Did you bring me my hearts ? Yesterday you said something about me taking it personally . Why did you say that ? Where were you in 1973 ? - What , the whole year ? - November . 27th of November . Do you know what I 'm getting at ? I was selling vacuum cleaners in 1973 . I made a sales trip to Martha 's Vineyard that year , and ... .. I sold a vacuum cleaner to your dad . He bought it for your mom . I believe it was a , um ... .. ElectroVac Duchess or the Princess model . Your dad and I talked about it at great length . He had a really hard time choosing . What do you know about my sister ? You bring me my hearts , and maybe I 'll tell you more . This man ... This man hit me . I didn 't see it . I did . He was there , Scully . He was in the house . He took Samantha . In your dream . It was a dream . Your mind made it up . A dream is an answer to a question we don 't know how to ask . Something buried in your subconscious . You heard him . He mentioned being on Martha 's Vineyard . Is it a state secret that you lived there ? - How would he find out ? - The prison library . The inmates have access to computers and the Internet . I checked . - Roche logged on yesterday . - Looking for what ? The server records don 't show , but on the Net he can find out almost anything about you . He 's playing with you . He 's committing emotional blackmail and you 're letting him . You walked in there with your heart on your sleeve . He saw vulnerability , and he took advantage of it . You had a dream , ... .. a nightmare , because of all the emotions this case is stirring up for you , but ... - .. it was nothing but a dream . - My last dream came true . Do you believe that my sister Samantha was abducted by aliens ? Have you ever believed that ? No . So what do you think happened to her ? What do you believe now ? I don 't know . I don 't know what happened . I don 't know what to believe . I just know I have to find out now . - Fox ? - Mom . I 'm in the basement . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to wake you up . I 'm sorry . How 're you feeling ? Good , Fox . What are you doin down here in the middle of the night ? Do you recognize ... - .. either of these fabrics ? - What am I looking at ? Just look closely . Do they seem familiar to you ? - Familiar how ? - Just familiar . - Have you seen them before ? - I don 't know what you want me to say . My memory isn 't as good as it used to be since I had the stroke . I just don 't know what ... It 's all right . Oh , Fox . Dad never bought you a vacuum cleaner , did he ? Yeah , a long time ago . I don 't use it anymore . - Where is it ? - It 's here under the stairs in the storage . Fox , what is going on ? Sir , I 've been denied access to Roche . I 'm told the order comes from you . Could you tell me why you saw fit to strike a prisoner in federal custody ? Agent Scully didn 't report that to me , though she should have . It was videotaped as per prison policy . You 're lucky I don 't have your ass in a sling ! - Sir ... - You 've gotten too close to this . You 've let this man get to you . I have reason to believe he can tell us what happened to my sister Samantha . It is looking possible , sir . John Lee Roche apparently spent most of 1973 in Boston . He did take one sales trip to Martha 's Vineyard in October of that year . - The timing is right . - I need to know . I just need to speak to him one more time . - This just makes it even less of a good idea . - Sir , the fact remains ... .. that we still have two more victims that we need to find and identify . No one has more insight into Roche than Mulder , and this is still Mulder 's case . You tread very lightly . You see that he does . I 'm not talking to you if you 're gonna hit me again . No ! You don 't get to touch ' em . They stay in the bag . - Name them . - Well , I think you know one of them already . Prove it . Watergate was on TV . You and your sister ... .. were sitting in front of it ... .. playing a board game , uh , with little red and , uh , ... .. blue plastic pieces . Anyway , you wanted to watch a TV show , ... .. the one with Bill Bixby . What the heck was the name of that thing ? How could you know what I said ? I was watching ... from the window . I was very careful . If that 's true , tell me where my sister is . - Pick her out . - What ? You choose the one that was your sister , and I 'll tell you where she is . Hey , come on . It 's a 50-50 chance . Either way , I 'm giving you a victim . That one . You sure you want that one ? Just kidding . It 's , it 's a good choice . Mulder ? Let 's get a team out here . - Let somebody else do this . - Help me , Scully . Mulder ? It 's not her , Scully . Am I right ? Samantha broke her left collarbone when she was six . We had a rope swing in the backyard . - It 's not broken , is it ? - You 're right . It 's not a match . It 's not her . It 's somebody , though . Like I said , it was a 50-50 chance . Tell us the name of that girl . It was Karen Ann Philiponte . She lived in a green rancher in East Amherst , New York . Mint grew outside her window . I stood outside her window atop sprigs of mint . - It smelled wonderful . - What year ? July 1974 . I had her mother on the hook for an ElectroVac Argosy , ... .. but at the last minute she said thanks , but no thanks . Oh , well . - It 's your sister . - If that 's true , tell me where . You wanna know a lot more than that . You wanna know everything , right ? The big mystery revealed ? - Drop the mind games . - I can 't just tell you . I mean , I know you don 't believe me yet . You need me to show you , to lead you through it , because ... .. after all these years , anything less than that 's not gonna satisfy you , right ? - You just wanna get outta here . - You 're damn right I do ! If only for a day or two . I 'm realistic . I mean , more than that , I ... - .. I can 't wait to see your face . - Oh , God . You 're gonna see the inside of your cell instead . You 're gonna rot there . Are you OK ? The last thing we should do is give this man his way on this . If we do , he could string us along for ever . I know you appreciate that . There has to be another way to come to the truth . - Clerk 's ofﬁce . - This is Special Agent Fox Mulder , FBI , ... .. badge number : JTT047101111 . I need a removal order for a federal prisoner . Can I use the lavatory ? Keep your hands in your lap . - Something to drink ? - Excuse me . - First flight ? - Yeah . She 's really excited . You having fun ? - Mm-hmm . - What 's your name ? Caitlin . What do you mean he checked out Roche ? He convinced the judge that it was an emergency situation . - And where were you ? - I had left Agent Mulder for the day . I suggested that he get some sleep . I have an idea of where he might have gone , and I can catch up with him . - I 'll catch up with him . Where 's he headed ? - Martha 's Vineyard . I hope that you appreciate the uniqueness of this situation ... - .. and its effect on Agent Mulder . - I understand the effect it has on him . That was the sum and total of my last words to you on the subject . You let me down . Let 's clean up this mess before it gets out of hand . No one home ? I sat on this couch . You know , when your dad bought the vacuum . - You ready ? - Go . November 27 , 1973 . I watched the house for hours . I parked across the way , out over there . I was just casing . I wasn 't planning for this to be the night . But then , all of a sudden , your parents leave , and I figure ... Where 'd they go ? House next door ... to play pinochle . I don 't know . - Whatever it was people did back then . - Go on . After they 're gone , I get out of my car , and I move closer , ... .. and I watched you and your sister ... .. playing that board game . A little after eight , I 'm about ready . So I move to the junction box . I cut the power , and the lights go off . I moved around to the front door and was ready to kick the door in . It was unlocked . It was 1973 . It was a different world back then . - Then what did you do ? - Well , you remember that . I came in the front door and you tried to get your father 's gun . I give you credit for that . But then you froze and then ... .. I took your sister away from all this ... to a happier place . That 's exactly how it happened ? - Right here in this room ? - Yeah . Wrong house . My father bought this after he and my mother divorced . The house that Samantha was abducted from is in Chilmark . That 's six miles from here ! You screwed up . You weren 't here . You didn 't take Samantha . - Wishful thinking . - No , but I think I know what happened . - Somehow you got inside my dreams . - Come again ? I profiled you . I got inside your head . Maybe you got inside mine . Maybe some nexus was formed between us . And through that , you got access to my memories of my sister . - You used them against me for this . - You 're just resisting me . You 're in the wrong house , you stupid son of a bitch ! You were never here ! It 's geography . It was 23 years ago . It 's geography we 're talking about . Yeah , but you remember all the other details so vividly . That 's because you watched it through my eyes , through my dreams . I hear things about you , Mulder . You know what I heard ? I heard you go after aliens ... from space . It 's like your world will be OK as long as you can believe in flying saucers . But I 'm telling you the God 's honest truth . And I can see you 're not as open-minded as you think you are . You must have been one hell of a salesman , Roche . First flight 's at 6 a.m. Enjoy your last few hours of freedom . Come on . Fox ! Fox ! Help ! Unlock me ! Help ! Help me ! Fox , help me ! Help me ! Unlock me ! Fox ! Fox ! Fox , help me ! Unlock me ! Fox ! Mulder ? Mulder , open the door ! You let Roche go ? I must 've done it in my sleep . I had another dream . Why don 't you check to see if anybody saw him leave . He took the last cloth heart . - He also took your badge and your phone . - Where 's your gun ? - How do you explain yourself ? - I don 't . A predator is loose because of you . God knows how many hours ' lead he 's got . Any idea where he might be headed ? - Yeah . - Where ? Where 's your phone ? - There was a small child on the plane . - What child ? Seaboard Air . - Please put me through to your supervisor . - What child ? This is Special Agent Fox Mulder , FBI . I 'd like a passenger manifest for Flight 1650 ... .. from Washington National to Boston , 8.50 p.m. last night . - My badge number is JTT ... - I 'm sorry . Agent Mulder called . An Agent Mulder called just ten minutes ago . They gave him the same information . He said he was with the FBI . He said her mother was in an accident , and he needed to take Caitlin . - You said he was a white male ? - Yeah . - About how tall was he ? - Um , he was about 6 ' 5 " or something . He said his name was Mulder . He had a badge . He said he was official . Oh my God , what have I done ? We sent a unit to pick up the girl 's mother . She 's on her way down . What am I going to tell her ? It 's all my fault . It 's not your fault . It 's my fault . I 'm sorry . You were right . He was playing me . - You don 't think he took Samantha ? - None of that really matters now . Where do you think he 'd take this girl ? Would he drive her out of state ? No reason to . He knows we 'll catch him . He just needs it to be later rather than sooner . He 'll be somewhere nearby . Do you think he 'd take her someplace familiar ? Try to relive some past glories ? I don 't know , maybe . What ? He lived in Boston in the early ' 70s , right ? - What 've you got ? - Roche 's old address in the area . 9809 Alice Road , apartment number 6 . He 's there . - How do you know ? - Alice in Wonderland . He 's the Mad Hatter . That 's where he got the idea in the first place . All right , let 's go ! Check the other rooms ! I don 't think he brought her here . He never brought anyone here . No one , sir ! All right , spread out ! Find the entrance ! I 'm beginning to believe we do share that ... nexus you spoke of . You always seem to find me . Are you OK , Caitlin ? Good . My name is Fox . I 'm gonna take you home . I have your gun , Fox . Caitlin , can you do me a favour ? Can you count to 20 ? Can you do that ? Will you close your eyes and count to 20 out loud , quietly and slowly ? One , two , ... .. three , ... - I will shoot . - .. four , ... - Don 't make this end badly . - .. five , ... .. six , ... .. seven , ... - You 're not giving me much choice . - .. eight , ... - .. nine ... - I don 't wanna go back to prison . Put the gun down , Roche ! .. 11 , 12 , ... - You have one left . - .. 13 , ... - How are you gonna find her without me ? - .. 14 , ... - How sure are you it 's not Samantha ? - .. 15 , ... - Huh ? - .. 16 , ... .. 17 , ... - How do you know ? - .. 18 , ... .. 19 ... It 's OK . I got you . Call an ambulance . I got back some lab results . The dye analysis determined that the fabric of the last heart ... .. was manufactured between 1969 and 1974 , ... .. but beyond that , there 's nothing more they can tell us . Mulder , it 's not Samantha . And whoever that little girl really is , we 'll find her . How ? I don 't know , ... .. but I do know you . Why don 't you go on home and get some sleep ? I made this !

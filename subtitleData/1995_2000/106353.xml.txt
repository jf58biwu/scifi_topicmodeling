I evacuated the city for nothing in an election month ? Do you realize what it 'II cost ? We 've monitored the waters . As far as we can tell , it 's still here . We believe it may be hiding in a building in the restricted area . - But you don 't know for sure . - Mr. Mayor ! We have to check each building . - What is it ? - That may be difficult to do . Terrific ! More good news ! We 've run in to a problem . - Do you believe this ? - I don 't know what 's going on . Right here , sir . Let 's go , fall in downstairs .

I think I lost him . We 've lost Echo 4 , sir . What 's the matter with you people ? You caused more damage than he did . - calm down . Have some candy . - Leave me alone ! I can 't believe it . He did all of this , and we did nothing to him . That 's not true . We fed him . Here at the command centre there is nothing new to report . The military has clamped a media blackout on whatever is going on . They will not comment on their attempts to contain this creature . The situation is under control . We have containment . - Can I help you ? - Do you have any Pregnancy tests ? The ones that look for gonadotroPic hormones . I don 't know ... - This is all we 've got . - I 'II take all of them .

AII this time . Yeah , I guess I 'm still a little mad . That was eight years ago . Some people change . Most people don 't . I 'm sorry you feel that way . Audrey ... You 're right . Eight years is a Iong time . - Can I make you a cup of tea ? - Sure , that 'd be nice . Why is an anti-nuke activist working for the nuclear regulatory people ? When you and I went to rallies , we helped to create awareness . But now , from the inside , I 'm able to effect real change . - What changes ? - I 'm preparing a census . I 'm cataloging new species that were created by nuclear contamination . - That 's what created this thing ? - Yes . I found a blood sample today . - How close did you get to it ? - Pretty close . - What else did you find out ? - We know he eats tons of fish . He 's amphibious . He 's a burrower . And he 's Pregnant . - He is ? - He 's a very unusual he . These tests weren 't designed for this , but they look for the same hormonal Patterns . If he 's the first of his kind , how can he be Pregnant ? - He reproduces asexually . - Where 's the fun in that ? I kept thinking , why would he travel so far ? Lots of animals travel great distances for reproduction . That 's what he 's doing in New York . He 's nesting . Did you know a lizard can lay up to 12 eggs at a time ? - Imagine . - I didn 't know that . I have to get this to the lab and see if I can confirm all this . I 'II be right back .

There are other places this thing has attacked . - Whose story is that ? - Mine ! If we can lure him into central Park , we can take him down . - Last time , you didn 't scratch it . - That 's not true . - Dr. TatoPouIos has found blood . - Yes , I did . We get him into the open , and use weapons that aren 't heat-seeking . The situation has become more complicated . The blood I collected revealed that it is about to lay eggs . - There 's another of those things ? - No , I don 't believe so . Then how can it be Pregnant ? What is this , the Virgin Lizard ? No , it reproduces asexually . We have to find the nest quickly . Or we 'II have a dozen of them , each capable of laying eggs on its own . - Their population may grow quickly . - We 'II kill the creature first . That may be too late . The eggs are going to hatch very quickly . - How do you know that ? - The fish we found on the subway . It wasn 't just for himself . He 's preparing to feed his young . Stay tuned fora special report Where have you been ? Your spot is up right after this . - Turn it uP . - Can you turn it uP , please ? If Dr. TatoPouIos is right , we must act quickly .

A second ago you said he was on the other line . It 's urgent . Yes . Nick TatoPouIos . You 're leaving ? Why ? Is it because of my story ? - What did you think would happen ? - You never said not to Print it . I shouldn 't have to , Audrey . I trusted you . I have to tell you ... I lied to you . I 'm not a reporter . When I came here to New York , I was so sure I 'd make it . But I haven 't . That 's why I needed the story so bad . I just couldn 't tell you I 'm a failure . - So it was okay to steal my tapes ? - No . I shouldn 't have done that . Good luck with your new career . I think you have what it takes . Newark AirPort . I 'm sorry ... Give her a break . Is this the best way to the airport ? Sir , where are you going ? Hey , hello ! stop the car , right now . - Let me out of here ! - I 'm afraid I can 't do that .

Because we 're the only ones who want to find that nest . - How 'd you get this in the country ? - You can buy anything in America . But why aren 't you guys working with the U.S. military ? I 'm not Permitted to speak of such things . You said you needed my trust . Then I need yours . - I am a Patriot . I Iove my country . - Sure . It 's my job to Protect my country , sometimes from its own mistakes . Mistakes no one should know about . - The nuclear tests ? - Yes . It left a terrible mess . We 're here to clean it uP . - What 's new ? . - Nothing . We know how to get into the city , but we don 't know where to look . Here . The 23rd Street Station . That 's where we found the fish . It 's a good place to start looking . So you 're in ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm in . - Great I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion . hello . Excuse me . - Honey ... - Hi , sweetie . - Who the hell are all these people ? - They can 't sleep on the street . - Where 's Audrey ? - She 's crying . Because of you . - What did I do ? - You said she had to be vicious . - Get out of here ! - Go in there and talk to her . Contrary to some reporting , there 's nothing to make us believe there are any eggs in the city . There 's no need forpanic . It 's all my fault . What have I done , animal ? This isn 't me . I don 't do stuff like this . You made a mistake . It happens . I screwed up with the only man who will ever care about me . - You want to make it uP to him ? - Of course I do . After he left you in the street , I followed him . I figured I 'd talk some sense into the guy . Then he met a bunch of French wackos in military uniforms . - They 're gonna sneak into the city . - They 're going after the nest . If he finds it , you can let the world know that he was right . - You want me to follow him ? - Yeah , we both will . - Come on , it 'II be fun . - I already made a mess of things . I 'm going after him . You can go with me , or not . - What are you doing ? - Lucy will hurt me . - What 's with the chewing gum ? - It makes us look more American . really ?

We 'se discovered over200 eggs . Get Hicks ! They 'sejustbegun hatching . Thoughjusthatched , the creatures are overnine feet tall . They 'se begun feeding . When their foodsupply runs out , they will begin to hunt forfood . Ifthey get out , they 'll multiply , and a newspecies will emerge . One that could replace us . Each one ofthese reptiles is born pregnant These 200 could become 40,000 within this year . Ifthe military is listening , they must destroy this building now , before these creatures can escape . They 're trapped in the building , but we can 't contain them for long . They 're very strong , they 're agile , and they 're looking for food . So your theory turned out to be correct after all . regardless of what happens to us , this building must be destroyed before they escape into the city .

 In December 1903 , Russia and Japan were divided over the invasion of China and fought in Lu Hsun , China . The Ching Emperor 's mother , Empress Dowager asked why two foreign countries should be fighting in our country ! She lost her temper . To uphold the pride of her country and to protect peace in the land , she had China 's troops remain ... neutral Many men realized their ambitions amid the turmoil . Pang Ta Fu was one of them . Leading a band of brigands , he took advantage of the situation to loot and pillage . They were known as the Red Beards . Ching authorities could ignore the war , but not them . The army was called in . Pang Ta Fu was highly elusive . His men were fearless desperadoes and Pang himself was a superb marksman . He shot the red tassels from the hats of the chief officer and his aide and put terror into the hearts of their men . The Russian marshal sought his aid and paid him 10,000 rubles daily . Pang knew the country well . He attacked the Japanese so swiftly , they hardly knew what hit them , forcing them to sign the Sino-Russian treaty . The Czar of Russia personally presented a sapphire medal to Pang and invited him to St. Petersburg . Thus a brigand became a warlord who took over Shantung . He was welcomed with 3 months of drought . The Warlord Attention ! Who are you ? Lu Hung . You 're up early today . I always get up before daybreak Why don 't you light up the place ? I did . It 's nice and bright now . You 've got your wife 's stockings on . You 're absolutely listless . On your knees . Get down . Mark it down . Yes sir , I 'm on my knees . Where 's the major ? Get their major ! Chao Kuo Shu ! Sir ! 2nd Major of 3rd camp reporting ! What are your orders , sir ? Look , your men pose as women ! Well , don 't stand there ! On your knees ! Yes sir . I 'm on my knees . Look at you : No wonder it won 't rain . Men worship gods as lords worship kings . Each has his allocated duty . Sun and rain are controlled by gods . The drought has brought suffering . Let there be wind and rain . Water is needed to sustain the land . Please assist in prayer , sir . Dragon King , you call yourself . You 're supposed to control the weather . It hasn 't rained for three months . Our crops are completely ruined . The people are crying aloud and you sit there ignoring them ! Dragon King , you must be deaf ! Listen , if it doesn 't rain in 3 days , I 'll blast you out of the sky ! If you have any doubts , wait and see ! Attention ! On your feet ! We 're on our feet , sir ! Abusing a god will bring disaster . May the heavens protect us . Dragon King ... kill ! May the heavens protect us ! Abusing a god will bring disaster . See ? See what ? The four astride the car . As a judge , the Marshal is like a dog at a bone Don 't make so much noise . Just wait and watch what happens . Pang is quite a judge . Pang is quite a judge . His Excellency is here on inspection . Bring your cases to court . How many wives has he got ? Even he can 't remember ! How do I know ? Some basic , some temporary , some who broke their contracts , some who 're on sick leave . But it 's not only his wives . Ask him what troops , what money he has and you 'll draw a blank on all three . Yes , and ... Watch him in court If he pats his bald head and does this , you must have pleased fate because then you 're safe But if he goes like this , it 's over . Over ? The firing squad . This is interesting . Let 's go and watch . Attention ! Salute ! At ease ! A rape case Bring out the victim ! Bring out the defendant Kao Chen Pai , the plaintiff Mrs. Kao Pai and witnesses . Your Excellency ! Your Excellency ! You 're Madam Kao Pai ? Yes sir . When did you marry into the Kao family ? What happened with your brother-in-law ? I married at 18 . My husband died within 2 years . What did he die of ? Physical exhaustion Physical exhaustion ? He must have been too passionate . The doctor called it exhaustion . We had neither parents nor children . Our only kin was his brother . I hoped he would grow up nicely , so I could depend on him in old age , but he 's an ungrateful monster and I was his victim . I can hardly face people . Don 't worry , I 'll settle this . Thank you , Excellency , thank you . Enough of that . You . You 're Kao Chen Pai ? Yes . I 'm Kao Chen Pai . You 're made out to be a scoundrel . I 'm innocent , Excellency . Don 't speak unless spoken to ! You look like a ruffian to me . A black sheep ! An animal ! You 're the cashier in Kao 's Inn ? Yes , my name 's Tung Lao Cheng . Madam Kao , where do you live ? What do you do ? How many dependents ? How were you raped ? Tell me from the beginning . We live at Kao Lane , Ta Nan Street . My husband 's grandfather left us an inn . We have a servant , Chi . Chi what ? Chi Pa Chang . Chi what ? Chi Pa Chang ! Chi Pa Chang How old is he ? How long has he worked ? Three and half years . There 's also a sweeper , Hsiao Erh Tzu Coming ! Make a delivery . The cashier Tung has worked for 30 years . He was with Grandpa . He 's 64 now . It was June 24 . My brother-in-law wrote from China that he 'd be home on school vacation . He should have arrived that morning , but he hadn 't appeared by four o 'clock I was getting worried . It was hot and I was fretting . Since I was alone , I removed my tunic so that it 'd be easier for me to handle the chores . I didn 't hear you coming . I didn 't expect you like this . You 're late . The train was delayed . Sister-in-law , your skin is beautiful . I 'm like a mother to you . Now don 't be naughty . You , like a mother ? You 're not much older than I. More like a sister maybe . In Ou Yiu Yuan , if a man dies , his brother inherits his wife . Kao Chen Pai ! Rape ! Help ! Come back ! Help ! Rape ! Kao Chen Pai , you devil ! You 're worse than an animal ! Mr. Tung , this is a mistake ! Mistake ? If it wasn 't you , who was it ? One must be fair ! We 'll discuss it at the magistracy . Right then . Let 's go . What happened ? Take him to the magistracy . It 's rape . What to do ? What happened ? He ... What happened ? He ... he 's a beast ! He 's a disgrace ! Sir , you must uphold justice . I thought you looked a scoundrel , but shooting scum like you would be a waste of bullets . Better to have you dig your own grave Yes , bury him alive ! It 's all right if I say so . If you say so , I won 't do it . Perhaps we should tear him apart . - Yes ! Your Excellency , I 'm innocent ! Your Excellency , I 'm innocent ! What are you doing ? Didn 't you hear him ? Come back ! If we drag him out just like that , it would make mockery of justice . Isn 't that right , Madam Kao ? Kao Chen Pai , explain how you 're innocent , but tell the truth a single lie will finish you ! Do you understand ? It was June 24 ... Mr. Tung . - You 're back . Why so late ? The train was delayed . Where 's Hsiao Erh ? Making a delivery . Madam Kao 's upstairs . You 're wet with sweat .

You won 't get away with it ! Excellency , he 's talking rubbish . He ... Who , Chi Pa Chang ? - I 'm Chi Pa Chang Did Kao Chen Pai speak the truth ? The son of a bitch is lying ! The son of a what ? What are you the son of ? Now , listen : Each of you tells his own story and personal opinion . Well , I have my own interpretation . Isn 't that right ? - Right ! Isn 't that right ? - Right ! You people out there , am I not right ? Right . His Excellency is always right ! Mr. Tung , what they said just now ? You heard it clearly ? Yes . Are they right then ? I wasn 't there at the beginning . What about the end ? The end ? What about the end ? Both accounts are about the same . Mrs. Kao , you say he raped you . Did he gain entry ? Gain entry ? Look at you . What I say is , rape has three degrees . First , simple molestation . Nothing too serious , a half month in jail . Second , more violent , the tearing of clothes . For bodily harm , 100 strokes . Then 3-5 years jail plus probation . And the third degree ? Gaining entry . Death by firing squad . It was the third degree ! You mean he gained entry ? Yes . A life is at stake . I must examine you . You 're welcome to . If you lied , you 'll take the sentence . You may examine me , Excellency . Fine . Wang Te Piao ! Sir ! Remove your jacket and rape this woman ! Let 's see how far you can get . Did you hear me ? Yes sir ! Excellency , the penalty is death If you do it yourself , yes , but not if I order you to . Soldiers must obey penalty for mutiny is also death . - Sir ! Now go on ! I 'm sorry , madam , I have orders . Pardon me if I make any mistakes . A soldier doesn 't know his own strength , so if I don 't do it right , please let me apologise . Wang Te Piao ! Yes , sir ! What are you gibbering ? Attention ! Charge ! Yes sir ! Charge ! Let it pass , she 's too young . Forgive her ! Shouldn 't give it much of a thought . You 're such a moron ! Useless idiot ! Dimwit ! Chao Te Sheng ! Sir ! Go and assist him ! Two of you should do it ! Yes sir ! Excellency , go easy on her ! Okay , I 've seen enough . Look at you two ! Get up ! You 're a pair of fools ! Soldiers are fed for times of need . You 've failed a simple assignment What will you do if there 's war ? Two brutes like you can 't compare to a skinny student ! Return to your posts ! Yes , sir . Madam Kao ! - Excellency ! Even those two hulks failed ! How did your brother-in-law do it ? You were lying all the time ! Excellency , I was wrong . Pao Ching-tien . Your Magistracy ... you 've done great justice indeed .

Now come and see this one . Come and have a look at this one . Your expression is just like hers . She 's wearing a bracelet ! This is for you . No need to buy it on the street . We 've plenty here . Thank you , I have one . Oh ? But mine is different . About the same . How can your thing and mine be about the same ? Impossible ! You 're being vulgar . Vulgar ? How do you know ? Feel it . Don 't go ! Wait ... Wait , listen ... Father ! Yang Shu Cheng , what happened ? Hold it ! You dare walk out ? Just try ! Why not ? Is there no law ? Law ? I 'm the law ! Just try me ! You 're a lawless bastard ! Excellency ! Father ! Why did you do that ? He called me a bastard ! Never slap a man in the face . He called me a bastard , the bastard ! Father ! Father ! What 's the matter ? Who asked you in ? Get out ! Get out ! Yes , sir ! Get out ! Yes , sir ! Forget it . I 've lost interest . Give her $ 20,000 and get her out . Excellency ! Shut up and go ! The Nationalist republic was formed with the fall of Ching dynasty , but before its troops took the north , China was divided by warlords . Most of it was occupied by soldiers greedy for more control over people . Hence , this led to war everywhere . They fought for power to gain more territory and to squeeze the people dry so they could multiply their troops in order to gain more territory and squeeze more people dry . The more territory , the more power . While blood ran at the front lines as the two marshals pit their wits , sweat ran at the rear . That 's it ! A kill ! I 'll take this hand ! Marshal Chang , you must have been born a Leo . How did you know ? Your hands roam around a lot . A pair ! You bring me luck ! Damn it ! Lucky in love , but not at gambling Report ! Sir , we 've taken Hai Tin ! We 'll enter Hsi Chih Men by morning . We 'll enter Hsi Chih Men by morning . Oh damn , I 'm fine here . Lucky at gambling , unlucky in war . Put it in that side . I 'll pay your victorious army 's wages . Now for another kill ! Kill ! Charge ! What ? Cleaned out ? Bet your 4th mistress for $ 10,000 then . Nice try . Have you no shame ? I 'll take you on for Peking . How ? If I lose , I 'll retreat to Tung Ling . But if you lose ... What if I do ? Retire to Feng Tien . Right , Peking isn 't ours yet anyway . I 'm on a winning streak . Come on ! What a hand ! Good ! Come on , now ! Good , there 's a door here . Dead hand ! There go my hopes for the throne . Bloody hell ! Counselor , Yes , sir ! Order the retreat . We can almost march on Peking , and Peking is the seat of emperors . Too bad , I lost . Retreat to Tung Ling ! What 's wrong ? We won ! So what ? The marshal lost ! Captain , this ... Let 's have a look over there . I 'll try to rush it . If we don 't pay the man soon , I won 't be able to carry on . The men are grumbling . Some of them have already deserted . All right , I 'll try to rush it That 's Mt . Tsang Sui . There 's Tung Ling and Cheung Chau and Sai Ling of Tai Ling Chen . 5 emperors and 4 empresses are buried there . Emperors Hsun , Han , Chien , Hsien , Tung Empresses Hsiao , Chuan , Tzu , His . That 's the tomb of Empress Hai . She 's also known as the Empress Dowager . Bless her majesty ! Right , right The tomb of Empress Hai . A raid on the tomb ! A raid on the tomb ? Wonderful ! In the 34th year of Kuang Sui 's reign , according to the records , the Empress Dowager was buried with pearls and diamonds and rare precious gems including 23 necklaces , red and green jade bracelets , white jade carved statuettes ... Bright golden carved jade dragons ... All right . You 'll never finish the list . Yes . The most precious item is a bowl-sized jade watermelon : Green exterior and red inside . Place it in a pool , and the water will turn jade-green . I 've said it first , I want that watermelon ! If it gets into your hands , others will turn green with envy ! You never say anything nice ! But if you do it openly and the news leaks out , it 'll not only tarnish your reputation , but may cause a rebellion . Right . We 'll surround the place . There must be an excuse . On the other hand , the entrance must be blasted open . It will make quite a noise . Yes . What 's the matter ? I have an idea . Among us mistresses , there are a lot of differences . There are a lot of differences . We 'll say your two captains are fighting for your favors , fighting amongst themselves for our favour , which could flare up a war scene in Tung Ling Wonderful ! We 'll close the roads in Tung Lin for the safety of the people . Close the roads ! Then Captains Chou and Hsieh can do what they like in the tomb . Brilliant ! I 'll make you my Empress Dowager ! Damn it ! Dangerous individuals are in the area . A curfew has therefore been set up . In the Tung Ling area especially , two organizations will fight each other . Stay safely indoors for 3 days . It 's dark inside . Double doors ... Damn it ! You want to get killed ! Push ! Go on ! This way ! Move , quick ! It won 't open ... Men ! Quick ! What 's this ? If you blast it like that , the whole place will be entirely destroyed . Do you want to join the Dowager ? Do you want to join the Dowager ? Just make a hole . What 's this ? Twenty-one words on the first line . Five on the second . What does it say ? Something Dowager ... then something What Dowager ? The Empress Dowager I know , Dowager what ? Dowager what ? You ask me , who 'll I ask ? Come , let 's begin ! Come , let 's begin ! Attention ! Salute ! At ease ! Your Majesty ! We 're sorry to barge in . We 're sorry to barge in .

Now give us a chance . Now give us a chance . Let us borrow some of your jewels . We 're on orders , so we can 't help it . Sorry . We 're on orders so we can 't help it . Sorry . Move ! Quick ! One Two Three Four , One Two Three Four , One Two Three Four , One Two Three Four , One Two , One Two , Three Three Four . Open ! Let me tell you , this is a grave matter . If we 're found out , the offense carries heavy punishment . We 'd best get the Dowager 's consent . We 'd best get the Dowager 's consent . But she 's a corpse ! We must make an agreement with Empress Dowager We must make an agreement with Empress Dowager Her fingerprint will do the trick . A contract with the dead ? Money and influence uphold contracts . Besides , we 'd do the same anyway whether she were alive or dead . She 's already dead , ain 't it ? Empress Dowager , our regrets ! Empress Dowager , our regrets ! Please give me your fingerprint . Darn it , this scares me to death ! Counselor , the small trinkets have gone to the men . The main portion is all here . You 've done a good job . I 've been told to promote you . Thank you , Counselor . You might jump two ranks . Our future is in your hands . Right . We 'll talk again . Yes . Captain Hsieh . Sir Nobody is to enter . Right ! This isn 't a business deal , our Emperor is interested in your province If you present those rare jewels to his Imperial Majesty , he 'll surely support you . Yes ! Mr. Yamada has received an official edict : 500,000 rifles and 30,000,000 bullets and $ 500,000 can be delivered immediately . If we keep out the reform troops , your hopes of becoming Emperor can be realized right away . Don 't be too casual about this - the fortune-teller foresaw it . It 's easier said than done . Don 't mind his idiocy . It isn 't that easy for an emperor . Long live the Emperor ! Order from the Emperor ! You may take off if you 've nothing to do . Long live the Emperor ! The Emperor wishes all 72 concubines The Emperor wishes all 72 concubines to come to the palace tonight . Yes sir ! Who is it ? I ... I broke a jade bowl . A bowl ? What bowl ? The 9-dragon white jade bowl . How did it happen ? You 're careless . I dropped it in fright . Fright ? How ? It wasn 't you I saw in bed . Who did you see ? If it wasn 't me , who was it ? I saw a golden dragon . Gold ... is that so ? Yes , it was huge . When I 'm Emperor , you 'll be queen # 4 . When I 'm Emperor , you 'll be queen # 4 . Queen is queen , why # 4 ? I 'll quit ! The Queen then . Thank you , sir . Long live the Emperor ! Excellency ! Sit down . What brings you so late ? Excellency ! Bandits are rampant in Tai An . We 've caught about 50 or 60 . None of them will talk . They can 't be sentenced without witnesses . You 're tied down by the law . Is that all ? There are too many divorce petitions more than 200 of them . It 's two years since your last visit . The cases have dragged on unresolved . That tough to solve , huh ? You waited two years ? I could do it in two hours ! Idiot ! I could do it in two hours ! Idiot ! Is everything ready ? Come ... Stand here , don 't move . What do you want ? - I 've a , - letter from my godfather for His Excellency . What 's your name ? They call me Bad Luck . Come with me . Come ! Sir ! What is it ? There 's a delivery boy ... Wait . A delivery boy ... Delivery boy ? Put him on the right . Go on ! Right ! You on the right , killers , arsonists kidnappers , and delivery boy . You 'll go to the firing squad . I only brought a letter ! I 'm Bad Luck ! I 'm Bad Luck . Sir , the letter .

Who 's the plaintiff ? Me . My name is Wang , I 'm a cobbler . Who 's the defendant ? Him . Tung Fang Chi . He 's the proprietor of Tung Fang Shoes . What for ? He took my wife from me . No , she came of her own accord . You 're willing to go with him ? I ... I 'm willing . It 's by mutual consent then . Yes , mutual consent . But without my consent ! You say yes , but I say no ! Why not pay him $ 200 so he can take another wife ? All right . Excellency , it 's final ? Don 't be stubborn now . Quit while you 're ahead . That 's a fine purse . Count it . If it 's in order , go home . Tung Fang Chi . Sir ! Don 't steal any more wives . Yes . And you , stop seducing young men . Don 't worry , Excellency . I 'd stick to her even in death . Yes , that 's right . You 'd even die together ? Yes . We weren 't born at the same time , but we wish to die together . Same time . Good . Yes , sir ! Firing squad . What are you doing ? What is this ? What 's going on , Excellency ? You wish to die together at the same time ? I 'm making your wish come true . You 'll die at exactly the same moment . Give the king of hell my regards . Mercy , Excellency ! Who else wants a divorce ? Who wants a divorce ? We don 't want one any more ! Anyone wishing a divorce , please raise hand No divorce ... No divorce ? Yes . No ? No divorce ? Then go on back . Find happiness at home . Couples should get along and stop yelling divorce . So don 't do it , hear ? Yes ! Excellency ! Bad news ! My father 's here because of Bad Luck ? No , the reform troops are at Chi Nan ! The reform troops unified China . Pang Ta Fu was forced to flee . Japan , to disrupt China 's unity , tried to restore Pang 's forces . In Tokyo , they gave him a state reception . Pang 's difference from former state visitors was that where each brought a wife , he brought a harem . This caused a sensation . Yamada promised a $ 5,000,000 loan 500,000 rifles and 1,000 cannons 5,000 machine guns , and ammunition with a boat to Chi Nan . A secret conference was held . No joint announcement was made , but before Pang Ta Fu left Japan , he said a few words at the airport ... Attention ! This week will change the world , as it has changed me . The world really changed for him . His wives ran away , leaving him to be alone . Only his 4th mistress remained , who had quite a problem . Pang 's mission was to delay indefinitely the unification of China . The unification of China . He quietly contacted his former men to meet in Tai An Prefecture ostensibly to worship his ancestral shrine . The new Shantung government sent a gunman to follow his every footstep under the guise of a bodyguard . Who is it , counselor ? I don 't know . Excellency , do you remember me ? You look familiar . Where have we met ? Think back . It was ... in Tientsin ! No , I 've never been there . No ? My memory is terrible . Peking ! The theatre ! I 've not been to Peking either , but I 'm connected with the theatre . Theatre ? Just imagine that ! You ... You 're a girl ! You should know me now ! Shanghai ! No , it was Chi Nan . Chi Nan ? Yes , at your home . You wanted to give me a bracelet . Bracelet ! I 've given too many away . You 're ... Oh you forget too easily . I 'm Hsiao Lan Fang . I sang The Jade Bracelet for you . Hsiao Lan Fang . Oh , you 're the boss-lady ! I really have a poor memory . I should be shot for it ! Your father is a musician , eh ? Yes , now you remember . Where is he now ? With them . In heaven ? Yes , dead . He was a big man What illness took him ? You really don 't remember ? I remember him . A big man . He wasn 't very tall . Not tall ? He was shot . Shot ? The killer should pay . The killer should pay . Yes , you agree ? Of course . Tell me . Why ? Who did it ? You know him . I know him ? Who ? He 's a vicious killer with no memory . A merciless person . He 'd sell out his own country . Is that so ? What to do ? Shoot him ! Marshal , don 't worry , I can 't get away . I 'll stay and face the music . Boss-lady , you ... Counselor , you know I had to kill him . I had to avenge my father . I had to take revenge and rid the land of a scourge . He lived as he died . In an absent-minded stupor . They say he didn 't know the strength of his troops , the extent of his fortune and the number of his wives . He also never counted his sons nor how many fathers they had .

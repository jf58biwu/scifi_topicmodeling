I may not know them all personally , but they need me and I cannot let them down . What was your favorite part of Chicago ? ( Vesti clears throat ) I enjoyed all parts of my visit equally . No . That 's not true . The best part of my visit to Chicago was the people . Their warmth , their kindness , the way they welcomed me into their lives . It is something I will cherish forever . If circumstances were different , it is the kind of city that I could happily spend the rest of my life . Thank you . ( applause ) Lovely speech . Thank you . CHUCK : Fairy tales do come true , if only for a day . But you know , sometimes that day is enough to last a lifetime .

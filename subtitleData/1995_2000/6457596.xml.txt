 I have lived with a fragile faith built on vague memories ... .. from an experience that I could neither prove nor explain . When I was 12 , my sister was taken from me . Taken from our home by a force that I came to believe was extraterrestrial . This belief sustained me , ... .. fueling a quest for truths that were as elusive as the memory itself . To believe so passionately was not without sacriﬁce ... .. but I always accepted the risks - .. to my career , my reputation , my relationships , to life itself . Easy . He 's an FBI agent . His name 's Mulder . Come on , let 's go ! Get a frostbite bay , stat ! Let 's get ready , please ! - Basal temp 's 86 ° . - Right eye dilated . Left eye dilated . All right , let 's get him into that tub or we 'll lose him . On three . One , two , three . - Agent Mulder was brought here tonight . - This is an authorised area . - I 'm a federal agent . - Hold on ! We need to see some ID . There is no time for this . A man is dying . What happened to me out on the ice has justiﬁed ever belief . If I should die now , it will be with a certainty that my faith has been righteous . And if larger mysteries are revealed , ... .. I will already know the answer to the question that has driven me here . That there is intelligent life in the universe other than our own . That they are here among us . And that they have begun to colonise . I 'm Dana Scully , his partner . What are his Vitals ? - He 's suffering from extreme hypothermia . - No ! Get him out of the tub . - He 's lost all his body heat . - If you keep him in there , you 'll kill him . The cold is what 's keeping him alive . His heart stopped ! Get me one amp of epinephrine and a cannula . You gotta see this , Cap . We got a UFO or something buzzing us . Right up here . It 's been up there for about 20 minutes . - Could be a helicopter . - Not the way it flew over us . It 's coming at us again . It 's gonna crash . Reverse engine ! We 're going after it . Two days ago , the crew of an ice cutter thought they had seen a UFO ... .. when a strange aircraft plunged into the Beaufort Sea . Later they recovered what is believed to be a Russian ﬁghter pilot from the water , ... .. where he miraculously survived the extreme Arctic temperatures . The man was airlifted to a hospital in Alaska , where he was listed in stable condition . But while authorities have been trying to determine who he is , ... .. we 've learned that he has walked out of the hospital and is now listed as missing . Reporting from our field ofﬁce ... - Where is he ? - Agh ! I don 't know . - I 've been looking for you . - I was down the street . Someone fired more shots at the White House . You gotta wonder when even the president has to worry about drive-by shootings . What are you working on ? I found these in my e-mail . Three obituaries . Sent by whom ? - Obviously somebody that knows me . - Why ? The deceased are Dr Landon Prince of Scranton , Pennsylvania , ... .. Dr Dale Gayhart of New York City ... .. and Dr Harvey Buchanon of Tea Neck , New Jersey . All worked in abortion clinics . They died in arson fires . - Sounds like militant right-to-lifers . - Sounds like it . - Why send them to you ? - It 's taken me all morning to figure that out . What 'd you find ? This is the latest victim - Dr Landon Prince . And these are the other two victims . Drs Gayhart ... and Buchanon . - Triplets ? - Nope . I can 't find any blood connection . In fact , I can 't find any records on them at all . It 's as if , before they died , they never existed . What ? Dr Prince performed legal clinical abortions , ... .. which has its own occupational hazards these days . You don 't know any more about him ? He went about his work quietly . No family 's come forward . What about the man you arrested ? This preacher ? Reverend Calvin Sistrunk . He 's got a motive . He 's threatened these abortion docs before . He was carrying this when we arrested him . We 're hoping for an indictment . As soon as you locate Dr Prince 's remains . Yes . But that fact hasn 't been released . There have been two identical fire deaths . Neither body 's been found . We 're certain he was in the building . His car was in the parking lot . We found his keys where the fire was started . He 's been missing since the incident . Could be we 'll just be finding teeth and bone . Good afternoon ! Reverend Sistrunk , these are Agents Scully and Mulder . They want to ask you ... If Dr Prince burns in hell 's fire for his murder of the unborn ? If his damnation is God 's will ? - Is that what you think , Reverend ? - I guess it 's a question of opinion . In my opinion , Dr Prince 's killer will be linked to two other murders . How do you feel about that ? There are those who endorse the killing of the heathen sinner in God 's name . But I am not one of them . Have you been to New York or New Jersey recently ? No , sir . This clipping , where 'd you get it ? From the newspaper . Obviously , more of God 's soldiers are seeking this man . - Which newspaper ? - The local paper up in Binghamton . Yeah , I remember this one . The man who placed this paid cash . - Would you recognise his face ? - Might . No . That 's not him . - Do you have his name or address ? - No , we don 't . He wouldn 't sign anything . In fact , he called to place that ad a second week , ... .. so we did , but ... he never came back to pay . Thank you . I 've got a bad feeling about this case . - What do you mean ? - Nothing about it makes sense . We 've got three deaths of identical victims . No bodies , a non-suspect . Sounds just like an X-File . You don 't know who sent you that information . We 've been set up before . If we were being set up , would we be given this little to go on ? There 's something bigger here , Scully . I 'll bet there are more of these guys . - More victims ? - Unless we get to them first . The deaths follow a pattern . New Jersey , New York , Scranton ... Then an ad is placed here in Binghamton looking for a man exactly like the others . The killer 's moving in a northerly direction . Uh ... Excuse me . Excuse me . The number in the ad , would that be a voice mail ? Yes . - How would you access that ? - Well , you 'd start by paying the bill . Dial the number , then press 1236 . There 's 24 messages responding to the ad . First caller 's seen the man in the photo in Syracuse . That 's north . - Special Agent Weiss . - This is Agent Mulder . - I need to enlist your help . - Shoot . I 'm with Agent Scully . We believe a man in your area may be in danger . His name is Dr Aaron Baker . He 's living in Syracuse . We need you to sit on him until we can get there . You got it . I 'll call you back with an address as soon as I track him down . Your plans will not succeed . Federal agent . Drop your weapon . I said drop it ! What the hell ... ? - Agent Mulder ? - Yes . Agent Weiss ? Yes , sir . - Did you find Dr Baker ? - No , I 'm afraid not . No one 's home . There 's two weeks ' mail in the mailbox . We may be too late . We should take a look around anyway . Not much to see . - Agent Mulder has arrived . - Send him right in . - Agent Mulder , please have a seat . - I 'm sorry I 'm late . I just flew in . - Me ? - Syracuse . Where you were doing what ? Agent Scully and I were following up a lead . - Did anyone authorise this investigation ? - No , sir . - Do you have paperwork on this case ? - No , sir . We had an understanding with respect to the X-Files . Agent Mulder , the people I answer to aren 't quite so understanding . Particularly when a field agent is found dead . What ? Special Agent Barrett Weiss , Syracuse office . His body was found in the trunk of a car in front of a house that you sent him to . It 's impossible . I spoke to Agent Weiss at the house . Save it for your report ! Until this matter is cleared up , your butt and mine are in a sling ! And your investigation , official or otherwise , is terminated . Don 't underestimate the seriousness of this , Agent Mulder . A man is dead . I want a full accounting on my desk in the morning . - Mulder . - Mulder , it 's me . - Where are you ? - I 'm at home . - Agent Weiss is dead , Scully . - What ? He was killed and Skinner hit the roof . We 're grounded until he gets a full accounting . I just wish I knew what the hell was going on . - Have you checked your e-mail , Mulder ? - No . Why ? I received something unsettling and I wondered if you 'd gotten it , too . - What is it ? - It 's a digitally-scanned photograph . There ' s another one , Mulder . His name is Dr James Dickens . - And , Mulder ... - Yeah . He 's right here in Washington . Stay where you are , Scully . I 'll pick you up . Agent Mulder ? My name is Ambrose Chapel . I work for the Central Intelligence Agency . I need to talk to you about the case you 're working on . - What case is that ? - The murder of certain identical victims . I have a story to tell , Agent Mulder . Believe me , you wanna hear it . We 've known of their existence for a decade . We found out they were in the country last year . Who were they ? Vague intelligence reports reveal that , early in the Cold War , ... .. Soviet scientists stumbled on a genetic anomaly in sets of identical twins . They isolated the DNA material that gave the twins their facial features , hair colour ... .. and they were able to reproduce it . - Are you saying these men are clones ? - By all outward appearances . How did they get here ? The programme went by the code name " Gregor " - the name given to every clone . We believe the original Gregor came here in the mid - ' 70s on a German passport . Using that same document , they were able to bring a small cadre of clones in , ... .. several of which are in strategic positions in the medical establishment . For what purpose ? In the event of war , they would mobilise simultaneously across the US ... .. to contaminate blood supplies , sabotage pharmaceutical factories . Essentially , destroy the country 's immune system . If you 've known about this for a year , why hasn 't anything been done ? Well , this is where the story gets perhaps even more incredible . Secretly , someone is allowing the Gregors to be systematically eliminated ... .. by a man who I believe is a Russian spy-killer , ... .. in exchange for the suppression of the programme 's existence ... .. and to obtain the science that created it . What 's your business in this ? We share similar sentiments on our government 's policies of denial , ... .. which is why they 've been trying to contact you . - Who ? - The Gregors . You 're obviously someone who might protect them and bring these misdeeds to light . What makes you think we 've been contacted ? Your inquiries into their deaths . And your response to the ad I placed . We 're talking state-sanctioned murder . If we can find them first , maybe the truth can be known . We know where one of these men may be . OK , let 's go . - Who is it ? - Agents Scully and Mulder . We 're with the FBI . - Dr Dickens ? - Yes . I believe you 've been trying to contact us . Uh ... - May we come in , Dr Dickens ? - Uh ... It 's OK , sir . There 's nothing to be afraid of . I 'll call the paramedics . He 's moving . He 's getting up ! I 'll call you back . - You OK ? - OK . I just got the wind knocked out of me . Don 't lose him ! - Go ! - OK . Oh ... He 's gone . - Where ? - He blindsided me . Went up the fire escape before I could grab him . I 'm gonna go see if I can find a way up on the roof . - How are you feeling ? - Like I should have used the crosswalk . A lot better than my phone . Maybe we should have dropped this case . Scully , if our friend from the CIA is right , this is a big national security conspiracy . Our friend from the CIA is about as unbelievable as his story . As is everything about this case . What happened to " Trust no one " , Mulder ? I changed it to " Trust everyone . " I didn 't tell you I ran a full background check on this guy . Ambrose Chapel is a 17-year veteran , special intelligence clearance . He 's the real thing . Why would a man with his experience need our help ? And how could he let a man that he 's been looking so hard for slip away so easily ? That doctor wasn 't running away from us , Mulder , but Agent Chapel . I think you 're being overly paranoid , Scully . Paranoid . Maybe it was Agent Chapel who killed that field agent in Syracuse . Shall I put that on my report to Skinner ? I 'd be happy for you to explain it to him . Dammit , Mulder , that is not my job . You 'll pursue a case to the point of insanity ... .. and expect me to follow you . There has to be somewhere to draw the line . Three identical men are dead . A fourth identical man is alive and on the lam . If this case seems like insanity to you , feel free to step away from it . An FBI agent died because of this case . Those are the risks we take . You either accept them or you don 't . We all draw our own lines . I have to show you something . I got these a week ago . I stepped in something last night that ate clean through the sole . Maybe I 'm paranoid , but it was in the exact spot where Chapel said the doctor escaped . Why don 't you send it to our lab guys for analysis ? - And arrange for an autopsy bay . - An autopsy bay ? Putting together my report for Skinner , I found something you 'll appreciate . Whoever killed that agent in Syracuse was so clever , no clear cause of death can be found . No penetrating knife or gunshot wounds . No ligature marks or abrasions from strangulation . The toxicological is clean . - And the blood work ... Well , it 's strange . - Strange how ? There 's evidence of polycythaemia - excessive production of red blood cells . - How excessive ? - Extremely . The doctor has it in here that the blood was curdled like jelly . As if something caused the blood to thicken or clot prior to death . Due to what ? Possibly a coagulating agent , but it would have shown up on the toxicological . Didn 't Agent Chapel say these doctors could contaminate the blood supply ? Couldn 't one of those contaminants have been used to kill this man ? I don 't know , Mulder . I ... There was a doctor 's bag I took as evidence from the apartment . - Agent Mulder ? - Yeah . Assistant Director Skinner 's looking for you . I 'll be right there . Check the bag . See if you find anything that connects . Skinner 's gonna want to know why you didn 't file your report . What are you gonna say ? Just the truth . I got hit by a car . I 'm sorry this is late . I had trouble with ... That 's not why I called you in here , Agent Mulder . Your father 's been trying to reach you . There 's been a family emergency . Thank you . Hello ? - Mom ? - Fox , is that you ? Yeah , I ... I didn 't expect you to answer . Why are you at Dad 's ? - Is he all right ? - Yes . Let me put him on . - Hello ? - Dad ? I got a message there was a family emergency . Yes , I received a very strange phone call this afternoon . I called your mother . We think you should come here as soon as possible . - Can you tell me what this is about ? - I 'll know more when you get here . I didn 't find anything much to go on , but we 've got an address . Check it out . - Where are you going ? - Home . This is Fox Mulder . Leave a message . I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . Mulder , it 's me . I need to talk to you immediately . I 've got some new information on this case . Mulder , I think I 'm in danger . I 'm in my apartment and I think I 've been followed . Your mother needs some time . You said it was an emergency . She wanted you to come . It 's a difficult time . I appreciate you coming at such short notice . What is it , Dad ? The certainty ... becomes a comfort that allows you to move on . We bury our memories so deep after all that has been destroyed , ... .. never expecting ... Who is Mom talking to ? Your sister . Fox . After all those sleepless nights , now I can hardly keep my eyes open . You 're exhausted . We all are . It 's after 5.30 . Oh , I just need a couple of hours . Try to get some sleep . - Fox ... - Yeah , Mom ? It is really her . Isn 't it ? I don 't see who else it could be . Go on , go to sleep . Is it too late for a game of Stratego ? It 's 22 years too late . I don 't think Dad could think of anything to say . He just sat here . So much has happened . Where do you begin ? I must have been nine or ten when I was returned . I had no memory . I was placed with a family who raised me as a daughter . Who were they ? I knew they weren 't my parents , but I didn 't remember Mom or Dad . Or you . But you came to remember ... us . I started having trouble several years ago . It was diagnosed as free-floating anxiety . Nothing worked for me . I hit rock bottom . Until I underwent regression hypnotherapy . And it all started coming back . The abductions ... The tests ... I 'm in danger , Fox . - What do you mean ? - You 've been contacted . You know there 's a man hunting my father and the other doctors . Your f ... Your father . My adoptive parents . They 're only visitors here . What people would call aliens . A bounty hunter 's been sent to kill them . You 've met this man . His lies to you have caused others like my father to die . He won 't stop until he 's killed them all ... .. and anyone who tries to stop him . He 'll come for me soon . This is Dana Scully . Please leave a message and I 'll get back to you as soon as I can . Scully , it 's Mulder . Pick up the phone . If you 're screening , pick up the phone . I need to talk to you . Do not , under any circumstances , trust the CIA agent . Your life may be in danger . Now call me . She may not be able to recognise him . He has the ability to disguise himself . - Disguise himself ? How ? - As anyone . - As anyone ? You gotta be kidding . - No . You can 't recognise him , but I can . Hello , this is Fox Mulder . Leave a message , please . Mulder , it 's me . I 've left my apartment and I don 't think I 've been followed . I 'll be staying at the Vacation Village Motor lodge off the I-90 in Germantown . When you reach me , I should have some very important information regarding this case . Wait ! Stop ! Federal agent ! Put your hands against the wall ! - Do it ! - You won 't shoot me . Put your hands against the wall . Now ! You cannot harm us . Sir ? It 's all right . We are the last remaining . Unless you protect us , we are already dead . Put them in maximum-security protective custody . No visitors , no press , no anybody . - OK ? - Yeah . Can I ask ? Who are these guys ? I 'll let you know when I figure it out myself . I should have some very important information regarding this case . - Vacation Village . - I need to speak to Dana Scully , please . Just a moment . I 'm sorry , there 's no one registered by that name . All right , I need her to call Fox Mulder as soon as she checks in . - Fox Mulder . - Fox Mulder . - Yes . - Will do . Who 's this message for ? - I 'd like a single for one night , please . - Ah ! See what I got . - Whose post is this ? - Mine , sir . We 're on changeover . I 'm gonna talk to the prisoners . You wanna get me a coffee ? Sugar and milk , no cream . - Do you want me to keep an eye open ? - No , just get me the coffee . Yes , sir . - Who is it ? - Scully , it 's me . - I got your message . - Where have you been ? - Scully . - Scully , it 's me . Where are you ? Scully ? Are you there ? Scully ? I made this !

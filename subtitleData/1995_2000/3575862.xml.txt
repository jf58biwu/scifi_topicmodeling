 CHUCK : It can happen anywhere . Down the street , across the block , in some of the nicest towns you know . Hatred , anger , violence . ( protesters chanting ) MAN : Hold those signs up high . It 's never pretty , no matter who you are , or what you are ... ( horn honking ) ... or even whose side you 're on . You know why we scare them , Lance ? It 's ' cause they 're cowards . They know the truth , but they fear it . We 're stronger than them because we 're able to face up to the truth . What is the truth ? The superiority of racial and ethnic purity . That 's it . ( shouting ) CHUCK : Like they say , what goes around comes around . Which is pretty much true of everything . Except maybe tomorrow 's newspaper today . Hey . This is my turf ! Hey ! I was here before you . Hey , cut it out ! Calm down ! Stop it ! What 's wrong with you ? Huh ? What 'd you ... what 'd you say if I told you you 're gonna hit your head , one of you , and-and-and go into a coma ? What do you think of that , huh ? Which one ? What does that matter , smart alec ? I don 't want to skate here anyway . Me , either . This place is polluted . " This place is polluted . " Hey ! My wallet ! Hey . ( theme music playing ) CHUCK : What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * GARY : Okay , listen to this . " Members of the supremist group the Society For White America " clashed with citizens of Blue Island yesterday " in front of the town courthouse . " The organization 's leader , Darrel Foster , " had come to pick up a parade permit " for this afternoon 's five-mile march through Blue Island , " when the disturbance broke out . " Baseball-bat-wielding supremists " claim they were provoked by the citizens , who threatened , then assaulted them . " Hey , you don 't want to get in the middle of that , Gare . Coffee . Here . Shh . Keep reading , Gary . " When the melee was over , four people were arrested , " and three people were taken to the hospital " with fractured skulls . One was listed in serious condition . " Baseball bats and bigots . Doesn 't sound good , Gare . Neither do fractured skulls . I think they should stop these people from marching altogether . Well , that 's the same thing they said about some other people in the ' 60s . That 's different . You have to draw the line somewhere . There 's good people , there 's bad people , and then there 's these people . And the Constitution protects these people , no matter what we think of them . What are you defending these jerks for ? You , of all people . You 're not exactly going to be one of their favorites , you know . Why not ? They don 't like blind folks ? Ha , that 's funny . ( chuckles ) Let 's see if you 're still laughing when they 're walking down your street . If I 'm gonna take care of this , I better get going . CHUCK : Wait a minute . Wait a minute . You 're gonna go down there ? What if your skull is one of those that becomes fractured ? Well , if I go down there , nobody 's skull 's going to be fractured . I have a bad feeling about this . Well , why don 't you go with me ? I 'd love to , but I got Blackhawks tickets . And don 't tell me the score . I don 't want you to ruin it for me . Blackhawks three-one . Thank you very much . You 're welcome . Let 's go . Just for that , I will , but if they start using my head as one one of those baseballs , buddy , ( clicks tongue ) I 'm out of there . Okay . See you later . See ya . Vivian , we 're going to need a repairman for that oven in the back . You told me that an hour ago , Robert . I 've already called . Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's the march , isn 't it ? That has you so distracted . Well , I 'm not distracted . I 'm ... Last week , you were , uh , in a total upheaval about all this . I know . I know . Really , I-I 'm okay . I mean , I realize that this is just a bunch of angry misfits , and they 're just trying to get a rise out of people . I ... After tomorrow , I 'll be okay . ( phone ringing ) Hello ? Okay , Louise , relax . ( sighs ) Yes , he 's here . Yes . Yes , I will tell him . Okay . Louise , everything 's going to be okay . Bye . Gus has gone down to the courthouse . Louise says he 's all worked up . She 's afraid he 's gonna start something with those people , and get himself hurt . Crazy fool . I 'd better get down there . ( sighs ) ( angry chanting ) FEMALE REPORTER : This is On-site News , reporting from downtown Blue Island , where citizens have gathered in protest outside the courthouse . Keep ' em back , Harv . This isn 't a circus . Wayne ! Gus , go home . Wayne , Wayne , you 're not going to let this happen , are you ? Can 't stop them . They have a permit . How 'd they get that ? Doesn 't matter . They have it . They 're legal . Not by me , they 're not . Gus , don 't make my job any harder . I 'm not in the mood . CHUCK : Wow , it looks like a block party . What are all the reporters for ? Foster called them . They like him , he loves the attention . It 's the tenth town he 's marched in . Each time he does it , he makes a little more news . CHUCK : That 's sick . GARY : No , that 's America . ( crowd booing ) REPORTER : There he is . Mr. Foster , over here ! CROWD : Go away ! Go away ! WOMAN : Why Blue Island ? You folks are a little early , aren 't you ? The march isn 't till tomorrow . Mr. Foster , do you expect any violence during the march ? Well , you never know , do you ? There 's not going to be any march , Foster . FOSTER : Oh , I think there is . You people have fought me with courts and lawyers- - it hasn 't done any good . The Constitution 's on my side . And a few of you , too . You just won 't admit it . Why don 't you crawl back under that rock you came from ? I don 't see any baseball bats . Yeah , well , they 're going to be here somewhere . Well , does the paper say where ? It said a brown sedan . What 's a sedan again ? A sedan . A-A four-door car . A brown four-door car ... A sedan ! You mean , like that ? Huh ? Yeah . Just like that . Come on . Excuse me . All right , Foster , here 's your parade permit . Now , take off . Thank you , sir . I 'd appreciate a little more respect from a civil servant like yourself . Nothing in that permit that says anything about respect . Excuse me ... CROWD : Go home ! Go home ! What 's this ? Put it on . Orange is not ... Just put it on . Right . Hat . FOSTER : Don 't pre-judge me . Just hear me out . Come on , give me a chance . You know , you people believe the same things I believe in . But you 're wondering what your neighbors might think . Well , they 're thinking the same thing . You used to live in a free country , where people could live where they choose ... without worrying who might be moving in next door . ( crowd booing ) ( man grunts ) Excuse me . Huh ? You 're gonna have to move this car . Yeah , we got a leaky gas pipe . It 's dangerous . It 's very leaky . We 'll only be here a few minutes . GARY : Well , then , we 're gonna have to have your car impounded . Watkins , get the supervisor on the phone right now . Watkins ! Right away , Mr. Borneo . Uh , fellas , can I have a talk with you , please , for a second ? This is a very dangerous situation . Just in that gas sewer right there , there is fumes coming , your car is parked right by it . You have a pencil I could borrow ? I have to make out a report . Wait a minute . What ? You 're not impounding anything . No , I am not ... Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! FOSTER : This march is going to show you that you can still stand up for what you believe in . Like what ? Racism ? Bigotry ? Call it what you like . It 's a free country . You 're not crossing that bridge . You threatening me ? Don 't you understand English ? ROBERT : Gus ! Maybe I should repeat it for you in German . Heil Hitler . All right , come on , Gus . Don 't do this . Don 't do this . GUS : The hell I won 't ! Come on , Gus . Let 's go . Come on . Hey , what you 're doing is , you 're falling right into his game , pal . Who the hell are you ? Hold it ! Thank goodness you 're here . WAYNE : Gus , one more step and you 're under arrest . Disturbing the peace . Get him out of here . All right , that 's all . We haven 't inspected the bridge yet . WAYNE : You 've seen enough . You 'll see the rest tomorrow . FOSTER : Hey , I 've got rights ! WAYNE : I 'll take my chances in court . Now , get going ! FOSTER : Whatever you say , Officer , but I want you to know , if anybody tries to stop us from crossing that bridge tomorrow , I cannot be held responsible for what 's going to happen to these people . Come on . Let 's go , Lance . ROBERT : Hey , buddy . Thanks for what you did . But you 'd be better off staying out of this . I think you 'd best take heed to what that boy 's telling you . ( engine turns ) Let 's get out of this town . It creeps me out . REPORTER ( on radio ) : At 2 : 00 p.m. this afternoon , a federal judge began considering a motion to block Darrel Foster 's March Across America in Blue Island . FOSTER : I don 't care who the guys were , they did you a favor . How many times do I have to tell you , it 's bad publicity to be busting skulls on TV ? Am I right ? We 've got them riled up . We 've got the news watching us . We 're talking , they 're listening . And what are we talking about , huh , son ? The superiority of racial and ethnic purity . ( laughing ) You hear that ? An 11-year-old kid knows more about why we 're here than you two . Now , get out of here . And when I want you to get rough , I 'll let you know . How you doing ? Good , Dad . Okay . I 'll tell you what . Those women say they need some supplies . Why don 't you go to town and take care of that , huh ? Yes , sir . Good . And don 't bust any heads while you 're there , okay ? Mr. Foster ? The State Attorney General today labeled your series of marches across America ... The Attorney General ? You hear that ? Seems like more and more folks in this country are ... are taking notice . Doing some thinking about who 's right in this country and who 's wrong . And we 're going to keep on marching from town to town , right across America , until the people decide to purge themselves of the poison that 's eating away at our society . Thank you . God bless you . REPORTER : Well , that 's it from up here . Back to you , Mike . ( scoffs ) Congratulations , uh , Lurleen . Your town is finally on the map . What a town . It 's incredible . A month ago , nobody knew who he was , now he 's a political force . If it weren 't for TV , people wouldn 't even know he existed . Think they could get a sports channel on this thing ? Hmm ? Did you see that kid out there today ? What kid ? The kid that was- - I don 't know , I guess he 's Foster 's son . He didn 't look like he wanted to be out there , did he ? Don 't worry about him . Believe me , he 's just like the rest of them . I don 't think so . GUS : Hey ! There 's the guy . Look , Gus , you promised . You got to slow down . GUS : The hell I do . Mister , I don 't know who the hell you are or why you 're here , but ... I want to thank you . You-you do ? Gus McGuffin . Gary Hobson . You know , you , uh , saved me from doing something stupid out there . No sense attacking a creep like that Foster in public , right ? Well , that 's right . Uh ... what do you mean by that ? Meaning , that there 's more effective ways of dealing with slime like him . You understand what I mean . ( church bells ringing in distance ) ( grunts ) Hey , watch it , you jerk ! Hey . Don 't bother . They do that to everyone . They think it 's some kind of joke . Yeah , well , they don 't know who they 're messing with . ( laughs ) Yeah , that 's what I always try to tell them . Doesn 't seem to do any good . You need some help with that ? I can handle myself . I saw you buying that stuff . Man , you got suckered . Did not . What did he charge you ? Buck a piece for that scrap wood ? So ? So ? There 's a pile of it sitting over there in the lumber yard . That 's where old man Thompson gets it . For free . Let me get you your money back . Then I 'll take you over there . Of course , if you 'd rather waste your dough ... ( sighs ) What do I owe you ? Two million dollars , plus an ice cream . No , I 'm not changing my mind . The guy 's got to be stopped . Let 's just get a check and get out of here , Gare , huh ? Is he , uh , always like this ? Just when he really believes in something . Then there 's no holding him back . Yeah , we sort of noticed that at the courthouse . Look , I 'm Robert Dombrowski . I own this place . Gary Hobson . Nice to meet you . So what were you doing out there , anyway ? You a reporter ? No . Uh , we , uh , well , we were just-just passing through town . CHUCK : Yeah . L-Look , you got any ideas I 've got any sympathies for this Foster guy , you 're completely wrong . I ... He 's just trying to keep you out of jail , pal . Jail . ( chuckles ) You got it all wrong , pal . Let me tell you something . Anybody in this town could take that guy out , and there 's not one soul who 'd testify against him . ( dog barking in distance ) Okay . This shot , double or nothing , for the ten million you owe me . ( sighs ) And the crowd goes wild ! If you 're traveling around with your dad don 't you ever miss your mom ? She 's home . Well , where 's that ? Indiana . Don 't you ever miss her ? They 're ... you know . So , uh ... you want to come in , hang out ? Actually , I ought to be getting back . Yeah . My dad makes me stay close , too , 'cause of that stupid march . I mean , can you believe those people ? Which people ? My dad says they 're pathetic , white trash . Everyone knows it . They 're not trash . ( vehicle approaches ) What ? Never mind . FOSTER : Lance . Dad ? What the hell do you think you 're doing ? ( door slams ) I ... Don 't you know better than to talk to that ... Dad ! I send you out on business , and this is what happens ? Hey ! He didn 't do anything wrong . Get over here . Who are you talking to , boy ? Some big bully , I guess . What 's happening out here ? I know who you are . I 've seen you on TV . You 're Foster . And what if I am ? You 've got three seconds to get out of here . ( laughs ) And then what ? If you don 't get back in that car , you 'll find out . Ah , you don 't want to do anything like that . Not in front of the kids . Might set a bad example . Know what I mean ? Get in the car . No sense wasting time out here . ( engine starts ) ( tires screech ) Let 's go back . You okay , Stephon ? CHUCK : Home , sweet home . So much for peace and quiet in the country , huh ? Think that guy Gus is serious ? I don 't know . It seems like he 's pretty serious about everything . Sports Daily , please . I just hope his friend Robert can keep him from doing something stupid . Hey , what are you doing getting a paper , anyway ? Checking on my future . In terms of the Chicago Blackhawks three to one , remember ? Yeah , three to one- - Hey , you didn 't , uh ... Oh , yeah , I had to . I mean , you gave me the score . I had no choice . No , you didn 't ... Oh , yeah . Don 't worry about it . I only bet a couple of C-notes . Well , you ... Now , listen , now , now , I didn 't know . I-I didn 't even look in the sports page , you know that . I just lost five grand . Well , I 'm sorry you lost five grand- - Five grand ? You told me a couple of C-notes . I pressed the bet . It was a sure thing . I don 't get it ! You 're supposed to be my friend ! I am your friend . Yeah , right . ( cat meows ) ( paper thuds against door ) ( meows ) Please , for once , give me the day off . Please . Just for once . GARY : " Politics exploded into violence today " on the bridge at Blue Island , turning the sleepy village into a hot spot of racial turmoil . " MAN : No more Nazis ! ( people clamoring ) WOMAN : You ought to be locked up ! We intend to walk right through Main Street . If you don 't get out of the way , we 'll walk right over you . GARY : " At exactly 2 : 30 p.m. , a series of shots rang out . " ( two gunshots ) Dad ? ! Dad ? ! Help me ! Please ! Help ! GARY : " The unknown assassin escaped without trace . " LANCE : Help him ! " Foster was struck in the chest by a bullet " as he led his organization of white supremists " across the Blue Island Bridge during their much-publicized five-mile march . " My God , he did it . What are you surprised at ? The guy 's asking for it . He deserves exactly what he got . Chuck , have some compassion . You know what I mean . He 's a human being . Not by my definition . So , what are you gonna do about it , Gare ? The reason I get this , I got to do what I can . Well , what if the reason 's on page three ? Or the want ads or in Snead 's column . Did you ever think of that ? What are you saying ? You 're saying I let this guy get killed because of his politics ? It 's worth considering . No , it 's not . What would he do in your position , huh ? Well , that-that 's not the point . It 's exactly the point . You 're both looking at this the wrong way . The issue isn 't whether to save Foster . The issue is saving his assassin . " No arrests have been made , but sources say the killer may be a local citizen . " Gus . VIVIAN : No , no . Blue Island is a nice town . Lots of nice people in it , I 'm telling you . You can 't be serious , Mr. Hobson . Gus is a passionate man , but he 's not a murderer . Well , yesterday at City Hall , he seemed a-a little stirred up , like he was just about capable of anything . Nah . You know , he flies off the handle sometimes , but he respects the law . He 's not answering . He 's probably just not there yet . He 'll be there . Do you have any idea at all where he might be ? No . Likes to get out in the woods , go hunting once in a while . Never shoots anything , but it keeps his blood pressure down . So he has a rifle ? Oh , yeah . A bunch of them , he 's , uh- - collects them . ( sighs ) Look , he-he left for good reason . I mean , he sees these people and their slogans , and it-it rankles him . He can 't do anything about it , so why be here when they ... ( doorbells jingle ) MAN : Delivery . You know what I mean . I-I 'll get it . ROBERT : Yeah , hold your horses . I 'm on my way . ( men chattering in distance ) Robert and Gus , they 're-they 're pretty tight . Oh , yeah . They 'd go through hell for each other . I mean , they grew up together . Parents were friends before that . Those are , those are Robert 's parents ? No . Those are his grandparents . That was in Poland before the war . They died in a concentration camp , along with most of his family- - aunts , uncles , cousins . Only his father got out alive . Vivian , don 't bore the man . No . That 's-that 's , uh- - Listen , thank you for the coffee . I have to get going . Thank you . Heading back to the city ? Uh , no . I 'm going to see , uh , Mr. Foster . What ? Well , as I see it , if he is in danger , someone should tell him about it . And I , uh , believe he is . ( scoffs ) What do you think he 'll do ? Hopefully , he 'll call the whole damn thing off . FOSTER : Call the whole thing off ? ( chuckles ) : You hear that , gentlemen ? This man thinks we should just pack up and go home . Does that sound reasonable to you ? Uh , Mr. Foster , can I talk to you alone , privately ? I 've got no secrets from my brothers or my son . Right , son ? Look , this is pretty important . You 're one of those local heroes from the courthouse yesterday , aren 't you ? I remember you . Mr. Foster , you go out on that bridge today , and you 're gonna be killed . You 've got some guts , pal . You threatening me ? Just take my word for it- - I know . Listen to me , my friend . I 've had death threats in every town I 've been in . You know how many marches I 've missed ? None . First of all , Mr. Foster , I 'm not your friend . Second of all , this isn 't a threat , it 's just a fact . You know what I think ? I think you 're trying to scare me . That 's why I 'm gonna tell you why I do the things I do . Come here , kid . See my son here ? I want him to grow up in a pure country , free of scum . That 's what makes this so hard , Mr. Foster . So do I. Fine . You run along home . And if you 're real lucky ... we might march through your neighborhood one day . Hey , guys , I think that man needs to be taught a lesson . Take care of it . Hey , wait a minute . Take Lance with you . Lance . All right ? Time for you to become a man . Hello , Marissa . Hey , how 'd it go ? How 'd it go ? Well , Gus is nowhere to be found , and Foster laughed me out of his camp . Anything else ? Yeah , I still can 't find my wallet . So what are you gonna do now ? What do you mean , what am I gonna do ? I 've done everything I can do . No way- - you don 't really mean that . There are two men 's lives at stake . Oh , yeah- - two men who don 't want to listen to anything I have to say . They might- - if they knew what you know , and how you know it . What if I didn 't know what I know ? I mean , would it be such a great loss to the world if this Foster guy , if he just sort of disappeared ? I-I 'm serious . You don 't really mean that . Listen , I can 't solve all the problems of the world . I mean , what am I supposed to do , just keep rushing in and trying to stop them ? If I hadn 't have gone there yesterday , Gus , he 'd be in the hospital with a cracked head . But you know what , he 'd be in the hospital- - he wouldn 't be out trying to kill Foster . Maybe , maybe not . I mean , you can go on with maybes forever . You have to make decisions in your life every day . You don 't know the outcome all the time , and sometimes you just have to do what you think is right . Well , what if I don 't know what 's right ? You 'll know when you find it . You just haven 't looked in the right place . Mm-hmm , and do you have any suggestions where I might look ? Well , um , if I had to guess , I 'd say look inside your own heart . What ? Go to the office , call the police . Why ? Go to the office , call the police . It 's the paper . Call the police . All right ! Hey . Well ! Good morning , Mr. Nice Guy . I guess you thought that gas man routine was pretty funny , huh ? Let me tell you something . The cops are gonna ... ( grunting ) Maybe we 'd better hurry . Now , the next time you try to interfere , it 's gonna be much , much worse . ( sirens wailing in distance ) We got to go . Hold on . We got to go ! Come on , Lance . We got to go . Lance ! Move it ! Lance ! Gary , what 's going on ? Are you okay ? GARY : Lance , wait . Wait . Lance ... ( sirens approaching ) ( panting ) ... but there 's not a thing I can do , all right ? Are you absolutely sure you don 't want to file charges ? I 'm absolutely sure . Gare , they trashed our kitchen . I 'm sure . Well , then can I press charges ... ? Look , he 's the only one that could positively I.D. the guys- - he doesn 't want to point the finger , we got nothing to go on . Who 's this kid , anyway ? He 's my nephew from Idaho . Look , thank you very much , Officer . Well , I hope you 're proud of your old man , kid . Thank you very much . Gare , I 'll be in there sweeping up the kitchen . Great . And I 'm gonna have to hire an army to help ! No way we 're gonna get dinner out tonight . Thanks a lot ! He 's a grumpy kind of guy . Your name 's Lance , isn 't it ? You all right ? How come you didn 't arrest me ? Would you rather I did that ? My dad 's gonna kill me when he finds out . What you told my dad at camp today , is that for sure ? Well , I-I don 't think anything 's for sure , Lance . Where 's your mom ? I don 't know . She left my dad . She tried to take me with her , but he wouldn 't let her . She told me someday she 'd come back to get me . You don 't know where she lives ? Indiana , I-I think . She tried to visit me once , but Dad found out and chased her off . She never believed in the stuff he was saying . I don 't know what he 's so mad about . Well , neither do I , but , I , uh ... I think he 's wrong , your dad . If you think he 's wrong , then why do you want to save him ? 'Cause I got a dad , too . Who started hating first ? What do you mean ? It seems like ever since I was a little kid , everywhere we go , they hate us . I don 't know . But I do know it 's got to stop sooner or later , though , huh ? ( loud clatter from kitchen ) What 's your mom 's name , Lance ? Uh , I got to go . Thanks for the Pepsi . I-I got to go . Oh , no , that 's all right , I 'll give you a ride . No , it-it 's okay . I ... No , no , that 's all right , I 'll give you a ride . I can take ... You just stay right there . I 'll give you a ride . Hey , Gare . CHUCK : Gare , look , I 've been thinking , all right ? Now , this all happened because of you , so you owe the restaurant . Great . Give me the keys to your car . I gotta take the kid home . What do I look like , a limousine service ? The kid 's responsible for trashing the place , and now you 're gonna escort him home ? No way . What do you want ? One hockey score . All right . All right . Give me the keys . Give me the score . No , give me the keys . Give me the score . Give me the keys . Give me the score first . Give me the keys , or I 'll take a cab . Red Wings , five-zip . Can I trust you this time ? Yes , you can trust me . Goal , Federov ! ( imitating excited sports announcer ) He shoots ! He scores ! You need some help ? Why didn 't you tell me who you were ? I did tell you . You didn 't say your dad was the head of that group . So what if he is ? My dad said if your kind had their way , they would kill everyone who wasn 't their color . I wouldn 't kill anybody . Why don 't you just go back to your march ? Do you do everything your dad says ? What 's that got to do with anything ? ( horn honks ) Get in the car , Stephon . We 've got to go . Get away from here . Your kind isn 't welcome in this town . Get out . NEWSMAN : Time again to check in at the Blue Island Bridge , where emotions are running high . ( protestors chanting ) What 's happening there , Teri ? Well , Mike , it 's just about zero hour here at the Blue Island Bridge . The local townsfolk have turned out in force , as have the police . And in just a few minutes , the march for truth is about to begin . Though it 's difficult to predict what will happen when Foster 's supremist group arrives on the scene , there is always the likelihood that violence could erupt . ( crowd shouting indistinctly ) WOMAN : Leave us alone ! MAN : No Nazis in our town ! ( indistinct shouting continues ) FOSTER : What ? ! Did I hear you correctly ? Dad ... My son wants me to call off the whole march . Does that sound right to you ? They don 't want it here , Dad . They don 't want us . Of course they don 't want us . They don 't know what they want , son . That 's why they 're in this mess . Why do we march ? What ? Why do we march ? To defend what we believe in . Why can 't we just leave people alone ? And they 'd leave us alone . You know , I do this for you , son . So that you 'd grow up in a better country . If you want to do something for me , call off the march . You sound like a coward , son . Are you a coward ? No , sir . You know what my daddy used to do to cowards ? Yes , sir . What 's the big lie , Lance ? Daddy , don 't march today . What 's the big lie about the races , Lance ? Why do you have to hate everyone ? Get him ready ! Gus ? Gus ? Robert ? Robert , this is not a solution . You shouldn 't have come here . I told you it wasn 't Gus . Get down ! Listen ... Get down ! All right . All right , Robert . Robert , why are you doing this ? I came this close to never being born because of people like him . Most of my family lost their lives for no reason at all , except for the ignorance and the evil of people like him . Every one of you could be proud of yourselves . ( crowd murmuring ) Proud that you 're standing up for what you believe . Proud to be part of this great movement . ( crowd murmuring ) It hasn 't been easy . They 've spit on us . But while they were spitting , we were taking ground , and taking names . And I 'm here to tell you that when our day comes , we won 't forget who was with us , and who wasn 't . You shoot that man , you 're gonna make a martyr out of him . You 're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison . Okay , listen , you , you 're gonna be ruining the future of a lot of people , you understand that ? The future is what we make it . I want you to know I 've received a death threat . But there 's nothing in the world that 's gonna stop me from going on that march today . And you know why ? I 'm doing it for my child . It 's time to show the world that we 're not afraid to stand up for the truth . So let 's get on out there and do it . GROUP : Yeah ! Are you going with me ? Yeah . Good . You can march up front with me . It 's time to be a man . GARY : Robert , listen . Robert , I 'm not leaving till you put that rifle down . Not until I do what I came here to do . Keep an eye on the crowd . CROWD ( chanting ) : Freaks , go home . Freaks , go home . Freaks , go home . Freaks go home ... GROUP ( chanting ) : White people unite ... White people unite ... White people unite ... Robert ... You a religious man ? Quoting scripture won 't change my mind . How are you gonna feel after you kill him ? Better . Better than who ? What ? Are you comparing me to him ? I think after you pull that trigger , the whole world will . Let me tell you something . Would you mind not pointing that at me ? I 'm sorry . There 's a graveyard at the edge of this town . My father 's buried in it . And this march is going right past that cemetery . What do you think he would say about that ? Well , he might say that , he might say that ten Darrel Fosters aren 't worth one of you . And that once you fire that thing , you 're exactly the same , Robert . Be a better place without him . ( chanting ) : White people unite . White people unite . White people unite . White people unite . REPORTER : This is On-site News , reporting from the Blue Island Bridge , where the forces of separatism are once again on the move . White people unite . White people ... Robert .

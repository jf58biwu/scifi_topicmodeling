 [ Blues ] Hope you got fire insurance . - Excuse me ? - Dumpin ' hot sauce on top of chili pepper gumbo ? You might as well sit down on a blowtorch . I like it hot . - Mmm ! - Whoo ! Let me get you a glass of water . Better yet ... why don 't I reel in the garden hose from out back ? [ Cheering , Laughing ] It 's been a pleasure doin ' business with you ... but I 'm afraid it 's past my bedtime now . So I 'll be on my way . I don 't appreciate being hustled . [ Man ] Now , " hustle " is such a distasteful word . Outplayed , yes . Outsmarted , definitely . But hustled ? There 's no gentlemen sportsmen anymore . You all call me again sometime , all right ? [ Woman ] Earl ? - Billie . - Who let that murderer in here ? You know as well as I do , there 's no stopping Eddie Fontenot . Sometimes , it 's better to see the devil than to guess where he is . - Whoo ! - He don 't appreciate that . He don 't appreciate that . This is for you , Marvin . Give me that ! You don 't wanna shoot that man . Girl , have you lost your mind ? You don 't point a gun at a man like Eddie Fontenot unless you plan to pull the trigger . I did . Damn it , Earl ! Marvin was your brother . You owe him better than this . And you should mind your own business . I appreciate you helping ' out . Name 's Earl Dupree . Jarod ... Pepper . Would you mind if I asked what happened to your brother ? Oh . It happened two weeks ago . Marvin was the closet thing to a father that Billie knew . She worshipped the man . She was also the one that found his body ... out in the alley behind the club . That must have been tough for her . [ Chuckles ] Marvin was a good man . Best pool player I ever saw . He just hustled the wrong man . The devil at the pool table . His name is Eddie Fontenot . Police could never prove that he pulled the trigger . But - You think he did . Marvin was lookin ' for a big score . Enough money to send Billie to a fancy drama school ... and get him off the road for good . She was his life . He just wanted to give her a different future . So Eddie Fontenot ... invited Marvin over for a pool game . A thousand dollars a rack . - That 's big money . - Had to be . The only black folks Eddie Fontenot let in his house ... come in the back door and carried a mop . So what happened ? Marvin beat him like a rented mule . He was up 50 grand when I left to come back here to close up the-the club . If you think Fontenot killed your brother , why do you allow him in your club ? The club is all I got . Eddie Fontenot could make one phone call ... and I 'd wake up to a pile of cinders . Don 't you think it 's time that somebody stopped him ? There 's only one way to get Eddie . - How 's that ? - You a pool player , Mr. Pepper ? I am now . [ Man Narrating ] There are Pretenders among us . [ Jarod ] I was taken from my family . Thirty-six hours and he 's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others . How many people died because of what I thought up ? Since I broke out , I 've spent every moment searching for my past . [ Miss Parker ] He 's a Pretender - A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be . - The Centre wants him alive . - Preferably . [ Miss Parker ] He defends the weak and abused . Life 's a gift . - You a doctor ? - I am today . - [ Miss Parker ] Daddy . - Huh ? Where have you been ? I 've left messages for you all week . Brigitte and I stole away to Aruba . Real romantic . Your mother will always be the first love of my life . She gave me you and your brother . - Nobody can replace that . - She 'll try . - A second family of Parkers . - She can 't have children . How can you be sure about that ? I don 't land in an airport without knowing the conditions . I had her medical records checked . Sweetheart , at my age , I certainly don 't want a baby . Besides , I already got the best . Hmm ? Oh , which reminds me . - I need a favor . - A favor ? We 're planning a little family get-together tomorrow night . You know , dinner , drinks , nothing fancy . - It sounds nice . - Yeah . The new floors ... won 't be finished , so I thought we could have it at your place . Daddy , I 'm not prepared to host . It 'll only be for family . Ah , bring that gentleman friend of yours . What 's his name ? - Thomas ? - Yeah . About time I got to know the fellow that 's wooing my little girl , don 't you think ? - Daddy - - 8.00 sharp . Oh , and easy on the dairy . And I do love you so . - [ Door Closes ] - Oh , God . It 's no fancy hotel , but it 's warm and it 's clean . Well , I appreciate the hospitality . [ Earl ] People didn 't always make it easy for those two . - But through good times and bad , Marvin loved that little girl . - It shows . [ Woman Singing , Indistinct ] That 's her now . Got a voice of serenity and a heart of turmoil . When you remember me I hope it makes you smile [ Humming ] You sing like an angel . You still here ? Mr. Pepper gonna be stayin ' with us for a while . You mind your manners now . What do you really want here , Mr. Pepper ? I don 't want anything . And my name is Jarod . Earl said that Marvin was like a father to you . What happened to your real family ? My daddy died in a car accident when I was a baby . Mama got sick and passed a few years later . There was no other family . Marvin was their best friend , so he adopted me . It was lucky for you . See this picture ? I 'd just gotten the lead in My Fair Lady at my high school ... which was a big deal ' cause I was only a sophomore . Marvin stands up in the club and tells everybody how proud he is of me . Uh , listen up , ladies and gentlemen . My little Billie is gonna play the lead in her high school play . - You should hear this girl sing . - [ Scattered Applause ] She 's got her mother 's golden voice . I 'm so proud of you , Billie . He always wanted me to become a singer , just like my mother . But that dream died in the alley , right along with Marvin . A dream can only die if the dreamer allows it to . Billie , I 'd like to help you find the truth behind Marvin 's killing . How do you plan to do that ? If I can hustle my way into Eddie Fontenot 's world like Marvin did ... maybe I can find some evidence that would connect him to the killing . You play pool ? Well , I 'm familiar with the architectural theory of dynamic symmetry ... as well as Descartes ' theory of coordinate geometry , um , lines , angles . - You ever chalk a cue ? - Excuse me ? You can put away your math books , Mr. Pepper . They may help you learn how to play pool , but they can 't make you a pool player . No . But you can . Me ? Do it for Marvin . All right . Let 's pick you out a cue . Okay . That 's for you . See ? Good . Okay . [ Blows ] [ Blows ] Fingers . Great . Now turn your hips into it and explode into the shot . - Uh - - Not bad . I 'll-I 'll get it . It 's not the shot you 're hittin you need to think about . It 's the one three strokes ahead . Nine on the side . Remember , pool is a mind game . Make your opponent think about you , and his game is lost . Can you do that ? You tell me . Pleasure doing business with you , sir . Excuse me ? Mr. Fontenot would like to have a drink with you . Mr. Pepper . Or may I call you Jarod ? - You know my name ? - I make it my business to know interesting ' people . You wanted to see me ? Well , I noticed that you shoot a particularly fine game of pool ... and I was certain that you could appreciate this . Richard Black , custom . Elephant ivory casing , golden diamond inlays . Cost me $ 50,000 . Does it sink the ball for you too ? Oh , touché . Now , would you care to indulge me in a game ? Strictly for sport , of course . - I never play for sport . - Ah . Is she a friend of yours ? Oh , no . Poor child was raised by a bad element . - A bad element ? - Primal , if you get my meaning . It so happens one of this element got himself killed , and rumor has it she blames me . - Now please , join us . - No , thank you . He 's a good pool player . [ Martin Luther King Jr . ] Be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice . I have a dream [ Applause ] - [ King Continues ] [ Young Jarod ] Why do people hate other people because of the color of their skin ? [ Young Sydney ] I don 't know , Jarod . It 's called racism . [ Young Jarod ] Why do I have to look at this ? It 's important that you learn what 's wrong in the world , as well as what 's right . I have a dream that one day - Are they taught to do this ? In some ways , yes . Jarod , there is no simple solution to racism . But there is . Stop hating . [ Young Sydney ] I wish it were that easy . It takes time and compassion . Do you understand this , Jarod ? - [ Crowd Cheering ] - I understand it . But I can 't accept it . [ King ] I have a dream that one day , every valley shall be exalted - [ Young Jarod ] I 'll never accept it . [ Sydney 's Voice ] This anxiety over your father ... is understandable , Miss Parker . Symbolically speaking , Bridget is taking your mother 's position . No ... she 's ... not . [ Sam Clears Throat ] - I , uh - - Yes ? I gained access to Brigitte 's house like you asked . You broke in ? And ? Her medical records . Your father would not be happy to know ... you had his fiancée 's house burglarized . Then let 's not tell him . - Broots ? - [ Sighs ] Dissect this file and leave no pap smear unturned . Sam ! [ Earl 's Voice ] Marvin was the closest thing to a father Billie ever knew . - She worshipped that man . - [ Computer Beeps ] Marvin Dupree wasn 't like a father to you , Billie . [ Sighs ] He was your father . Jarod . Where 'd you come from ? That 's a question I should ask Billie . The problem is , she won 't be able to answer me . Why haven 't you told her that Marvin was her real father ? - What are you talkin ' about ? - I found her birth records , Earl . Why did your brother keep this a secret from her ? He had his reasons . She has a right to know who she is . Billie 's mother , Janis , she sang at the club here . Had a voice like honey . She was a real nice lady . She was also white . When Marvin met her , she was engaged to a local boy . But they fell for one another ... and she took off with my brother a few days before the weddin ' . After a year , Billie was born . Now , when Janis 's family realized she had had Marvin 's child ... they told her take her black baby and never come back . When Janis took sick ... she made Marvin promise that he would never tell Billie that he was her father . She thought that ... that would make the world less cruel to Billie ... if they thought that Marvin was a friend . So he lied to her ... to protect her . Um - Uh , drinks first , then dinner . Then ... I 'll climb up to the top of the roof and jump headfirst into the driveway . - Ma 'am ? - It 's just an old family tradition . Relax , would you ? Your father and I are gonna get along just swell . S-S-Swell ? Oh , God . This is never gonna work . [ Doorbell Rings ] Just - [ Exhales ] Okay ? Incredible . [ Doorbell Rings ] - Angel . - Daddy . - May we come in ? - Mmm . Well , looks like you 're already in . We appreciate you hosting this little shindig . Damn floors . You know how slow construction workers can be . Morons with hammers . - Bridget . - Brigitte . - Whatever . Daddy , this is Thomas . - The construction moron . Don 't worry . I left my hammer in my other outfit . [ Clears Throat ] Heard a lot about you , son . Well , don 't believe everything that you hear . Like what ? [ Knocking ] Oh , I hope I 'm not late . - Tommy , this is my brother Lyle . - Nice to meet you . So you 're the lucky guy who won my sister 's heart . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm the lucky guy . What happened to your thumb ? Who needs a drink ? [ Chuckling ] [ Fontenot 's Voice ] I hope I 'm not interrupting ' . I was hopin ' you and me and Mr. Black here could play some pool . - I already told you , I don 't play for sport . - Play for sport . I remember . Nine ball . 500 a rack . Let 's play some pool . [ Jarod ] Nine in the corner pocket , and your 500 in mine . Well , that 's pool , isn 't it , Mr. Fontenot ? Sometimes the balls roll for you ; sometimes they don 't . Let me buy you dinner . [ Fontenot ] I have a better idea . I propose a rematch , say , later tonight at my place . We can bump the action . A thousand a game . Unless that 's too rich for your blood . Well , I 'll be playing with your money , of course . So if you can stand the embarrassment , I can . [ Chuckles ] My driver will pick you up at 8 : 00 . No , thank you . I 'd rather walk . Oh , you don 't wanna walk alone in this kind of neighborhood . You wouldn 't wanna end up dead next to a Dumpster like Marvin Dupree . Would he , Earl ? Patience , Earl . Patience . - [ Clears Throat ] - [ Clinks Glass ] Family and friend ... Brigitte and I have , uh , set our wedding date . - This weekend . - Outstanding . - Congratulations . - Thank you . Daddy , um , why are you rushing into this ? Well , it 's because we are in love . [ Mr. Parker ] Time goes by very quickly . Mustn 't waste a minute of it . A toast . To the happy couple . - Thank you . I 'll drink to that . - Cheers . - [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - Excuse me . Mmm . [ Exhales ] What ? - I finished Brigitte 's medical file . - And ? Well , it 's - A lot of it 's gynecological . - It 's kind of embarrassing to talk about . - This ain 't junior high , Broots . We 're adults . Talk to me . Well , it all looks legit . A Dr. Noah Lindquist diagnosed her as infertile ... due to complications arising from endometriosis . - But ? - I did some checking . And according to the A.M.A. , there is no Dr. Noah Lindquist ... practicing medicine in the United States or anywhere for that matter . She faked it all . He doesn 't exist and neither does her infertility . [ Broots ] What 's she up to , Miss Parker ? - I don 't know . - [ Mr. Parker ] Come on , angel . It 's time for charades . [ Sighs ] I thought the dinner party from hell would never end . I made somethin 'to help you sleep . Well , I thought that tonight went , uh , pretty well . Nobody died . And Bridget seems like a-a nice person ... and she makes your father happy . It 's so hard to watch him throw his life away like this . Then don 't . If it 's making you this miserable , maybe you should stop spending time with them . They 're my family . Maybe you should think about starting a new one . [ Earl 's Voice ] She was also the one ... that found his body out in the alley behind the club . [ Billie 's Voice ] Marvin stands up at the club ... and tells everybody how proud he is of me . But that dream died in the alley along with him . [ Groaning ] [ Man ] Let 's see him sink a nine ball now . - [ Jarod ] Where am I ? - [ Fontenot ] You 're in my home . I did warn you about that neighborhood . Good thing my driver happened by when he did . You might have been killed . I count my blessings . Good for you . Let 's play some pool . [ Chuckling ] A valiant attempt . But as Hamlet said ... " As he was valiant , I honor him . As he was ambitious , I slew him . " Actually , Brutus said that ... trying to justify killing Julius Caesar . But then he discovered there really is no justification for cold-blooded murder . So he killed himself . Well , I 'm sure if Brutus thought a little harder ... he would have come up with a better solution . It doesn 't take a genius to know that ... we live in a world where only the truly fit can survive . Meaning that the unfit should be eliminated , like Marvin Dupree ? Marvin didn 't know his place , so he paid the price . And what exactly was his place ? Why , in the back of the bus , of course . [ Young Jarod 's Voice ] I 'll never accept it . - [ Young Sydney 's Voice ] It 's called racism . - I 'll never accept it . I believe you owe me another thousand dollars . - Are you doing some remodeling ? - Pardon me ? I smell fresh paint . Looks like you 've just laid down a brand-new carpet . I like to keep my home presentable ... for special guests such as yourself . Hmm . - Another game ? - Not tonight . Well , like you said , Mr. Pepper : Sometimes the balls roll your way ; sometimes they don 't . Why don 't we play again tomorrow ... when both my arms are working ? Unless , of course , you don 't like the odds . - It 's a date . - Good . Tomorrow afternoon at Earl 's . Now if you don 't mind , I 'd like to use your restroom . By all means . It 's on your left , down the hall . Well , that 's not your average scrapbook . Well , that 's not your average scrapbook . After Marvin was killed ... I collected every scrap of information I could on Fontenot ... tryin ' to figure out ... what would possess a man to murder out of pure hate . I found the answer in an old Huntsville newspaper . I 've seen that picture . It 's in a frame in Fontenot 's poolroom . [ Earl ] Fontenot 's daddy . White sheets , burnin 'crosses . Fontenot 's father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan . Accordin ' to people who would know . I paid a visit to Fontenot 's house tonight . He has two newly patched bullet holes in his wall ... and he laid down a brand-new carpet . - To cover up Marvin 's blood ? - He was trying to cover up something . But he 's not the only one . You told me that Billie 's mother left her fiancé ... a few days before the wedding and ran off with Marvin . That 's right . You left out a pretty important detail from that story . You told me that Marvin was Billie 's father ... but you didn 't tell me Eddie Fontenot was the fiancé . Marvin was my daddy ? - [ Jarod ] Billie . - Marvin was my daddy . - Billie - - No . No more lies . - [ Classical ] - [ Chattering ] Ah . I , uh - I haven 't been this nervous since the day you were born . Uh , you and your brother . - Daddy ? - Huh ? There 's something I need to tell you about Brigitte . I know you have issues with her . But people change . Look at us , all dressed up on my wedding day . I 'm happier now than I 've been in a long , long time . Please try to be happy for me , angel . Huh ? - God , you 're pretty . - So there you are . - Mmm . - Time to go . Well , I can 't keep my bride waiting , now can I ? Okay . [ Earl ] Five games forJarod . Five games for Fontenot . Run these , Jarod , and the match is yours . [ Chuckles ] You haven 't run the table all day , Mr. Pepper . I can practically feel that $ 50,000 in my pocket now . You know , I 'm beginning to think that 50,000 isn 't enough . Maybe we should put some more on the line . $ 50,000 is not enough for you ? I wasn 't talking about money . I was talking about something far more costly ... like , uh , honor . What ? That is , after all , what you lost to Marvin Dupree , isn 't it ? I don 't know what the hell you are talkin ' about , sir . It finally occurred to me that losing a game of pool ... or being hustled by Marvin Dupree for a few thousand dollars ... wasn 't why you killed him . No , you killed him ... because of the color of his skin . You just couldn 't keep that hatred locked down anymore , could you ? Who the hell are you ? Powerful hatred , even from a bigot like yourself ... knowing that your woman ran off with a black man . You don 't know anythin ' about this . Oh , I do know that pictures never lie . Billie 's mother was supposed to be your wife ... before she ran off with Marvin Dupree , that is . And then there was that notorious pool game between you and Marvin ... when you lost your misguided honor right there in your daddy 's house . That must have been more than you could stand . That boy deserved what he got . He was a man . What he got ... was your fiancée . I think they make a fine-looking couple . Don 't you ? Let 's-Let 's go . Well , don 't you ? - Billie , what are you doing ? - Well , don 't you ? - I 'm waitin ' for an answer , Fontenot . - [ Fires Gun ] Yes . A handsome couple . - Billie , don 't do this ! - Stay out of it , Jarod ! - Billie , he 's right . - You too , Earl . - Not even God can save him now . - [ Jarod ] Billie , please . Tell me how you did it - how you murdered my father in cold blood . She 's crazy . - Tell me ! - Talk to her ! I wanna hear you say it , now ! All right ! Yes , yes ! I killed him ! I killed Marvin ! And I 'd kill the little animal again if I could . Get out of the way , Jarod . Please . Please , get - Would your father want you to do this ? End the hate here , Billie . [ Man ] Dearly beloved ... [ Man ] Dearly beloved ... we are gathered here to join this couple in the bonds of holy matrimony . Do you , Brigitte , take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband ... for richer or poorer , in sickness and in health ... till death do you part ? I do . And do you , uh - I 'm sorry . Uh - [ Clears Throat ] Parker . Thank you . Thank you . Uh , do you , uh , Mr. Parker ... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife ... for richer or poorer , in sickness and in health ... - till death do you part ? - I do . Uh , the ring , please ? If anyone has any objections to the union of these two people ... speak now , or forever hold your peace . By the powers vested in me by the great state of Delaware ... I hereby pronounce you husband and wife . You may kiss the bride . [ Laughing ] [ Classical ] Congratulations , Mrs. Parker . I wish you and your husband the very best . Thank you , Mr. Raines . I intend to do everything in my power ... to make his golden years memorable . I know I 'll remember them . - Ah . - Count on it . I think I 'll get some cake . Beautiful ceremony , wasn 't it ? The virgin veil was a nice touch . [ Chuckles ] Do you need a little motherly advice ? Now that you mention it , let 's talk birth control ... as in the kind Dr. Noah Lindquist provided for you . You do remember him , don 't you ? Then again , maybe you don 't , considering he doesn 't exist . Someone 's been a busy little beaver . Misinformed , but busy . You lied to my father about being infertile . You get yourself pregnant , and that makes it real difficult to trim you off the family tree . My husband and I have a very trusting relationship . Just answer me this . What kind of a beast uses the miracle of birth to cement her own position in life ? A baby with your father would be a child of love . Nothing more , nothing less . You were right about one thing though . If there were to be a child ... it would truly be a miracle . Thank you . I wanna thank you all for comin 'out on this cold Memphis night . We got a special treat for you this evening . I can 't do this . Of course you can . Just keep your father close to your heart . You 'll be just fine . Please , put your hands together ... and give a warm welcome to Miss Billie Dupree . - [ Applause ] - Go get ' em . Whoo ! [ Piano ] I 'd like to dedicate this song to my father , Marvin Dupree ... and to the man who helped me find him . Thank you , Jarod . There 's a somebody I 'm longing to see I hope that he Turns out to be Someone who 'll watch Over me Where is that someone To watch over me [ Footsteps ]

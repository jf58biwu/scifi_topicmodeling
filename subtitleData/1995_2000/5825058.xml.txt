 Launch conditions as of 05 : 30 are optimal . Final checks are underway and recovery craft in position . How are the C.R.C. numbers ? Mid 30s and holding . Meteorology 's got some hiccup they 're checking out . See our latest press ? " Childhood friends out to prove a theory . Can a manned spacecraft overcome atmospheric friction and exponentially increase its speed using only a planet 's natural gravitational pull ? " Huh ? Man , what is wrong with you ? D.K. , you know that feeling you get the night before something big 's about to happen in your life ? It 's the night before we graduated high school . It 's the ... Night before we started this job . I had that feeling last night in quarantine . Is this experiment that important to you ? Uh-oh . One small step , bud . Hey , D.K. Sir . You 're looking pretty sharp there - commander Crichton . Thanks , dad . Let 's do this thing . I talked to Pete Maxwell and the others at control . They 're going to take real good care of you while you 're up there . I heard that you , uh ... You went awol from the rat cage this morning . Man , in my day if I 'd ever broken quarantine like that they would 've ... Son , you got rattlers in your stomach ? Oh , I 've been up on the shuttle before dad - twice . Didn 't matter how many times I went up . Every time , rattlers . First E.V.A. , first time I walked on the moon ... I 'm not going E.V.A. , dad . I 'm not walking on the moon . You have any idea how proud that makes me ? That 's something I never did . I mean , the guys in the button-down collars and the neckties - they got to use their brains . The only thing I ever got to use was ... " Guts ! And the seat of my flight suit . " Son , I can 't help being who I am ... who I was . It 's not who you are , dad . I love who you are . It 's being son of who you are . Look , I ... T minus four minutes ... Can 't be your kind of hero . No , you can 't be but each man gets a chance to be his own kind of hero . Your time will come and when it does , watch out . Chances are , it 'll be the last thing you ever expected . Oh , no . That 's your good luck charm . Yuri gagarin gave you that . Oh , listen , you hang onto it and you give it back to me tonight , okay ? Ladies and gentlemen of the press at 26 : 14 on the flight clock we begin the major experiment of this shuttle mission . Commander John Crichton will pilot a craft of his own design in a dangerous attempt to use our planet 's gravity as a speed booster slingshotting him off into space at previously unrecorded speeds . If successful , the results are anticipated as the first concrete step toward interstellar travel . Canaveral , this is farscape one I am free and flying . Are you with me there , mama bear ? Oh , yeah , farscape . I 'm reading you loud and clear . Authorizing fight computer to initiate acceleration sequencing ... Now . Roger , farscape . You are go for insertion procedure . Approaching maximum velocity in ... 21 seconds . 18 seconds . Entering critical apogee phase . Farscape one , hold a moment . Canaveral , what ? Meteorology reports some kind of electromagnetic wave . Repeat , some kind of wave . John , do you read me ? Yeah , I read you . What are we talking here ? How severe ? Canaveral ? John , abort . Canaveral ! Son , you have to abort . Abort now ! Oh , God , I can 't ... Canaveral , this is farscape one . I 'm okay . Repeat , I 'm okay . Wh ... hoo , hoo ! Hey , did you guys get video through all that ? Canaveral ? D.K. ? Dad ? Where are you guys ? Where 's ... Earth ? What the h ... ? Uh ... Canaveral ? Canaveral , I 've been hit ! That 's big . That 's really big . Oh , hell . Canaveral , dad , D.K. , I 'm being pulled . The engine 's not responding and I can 't break away . Can anybody hear me ? Canaveral ? Oh , my God . Um ... Um ... Hl . My name 's John . John ... I can 't understand what ... What was ... ? I suggest you answer him quickly . You know how luxans can be . Your ship ... What kind is it ? Your ship appeared from nowhere and we don 't know that technology . Is it something we can use to escape ? We brought you aboard for one reason . Tell us or die with us . Pilot , I demand you give me maneuverability now ! Pilot ! There 's nothing I can do . Not while the control collar 's still in place . Moya can 't withstand this assault much longer . Those synapses you 're tearing out are not wired to the control collar . Then I shall keep pulling until I find the ones that are ! Get out of the way ! The others - where are they ? There are no others . I 've checked every cell level . I found a manifest . We were scheduled for transfer to terran raa . That is a lifers ' colony . Prisoners ? You 're escaped prisoners ? I will not be taken prisoner again . They brought you on board , didn 't they ? Don 't worry . I 'll protect you . I 'll look after you now . You look after me later . Hull integrity is reaching critical compromise . What have you done ? - What do you mean ? - The coding wall - it 's dimming . I 've hit the code . I 've hit the code . The control collar - it 's coming off . Pilot , prepare for immediate starburst . Moya has been restrained so long ... She is a leviathan . It is the single defensive maneuver that she is capable of . Terminate assault . All prowlers terminate assault . Claw onto something , people . Prepare for starburst . I hate starburst . Captain . Captain Crais ? Yes , lieutenant . The prowler squad has returned , sir . They report the leviathan transport has escaped . One of the prisoners , the hynerian royal somehow secured the key codes to the prisoners ' cells and ... There were casualties , sir . Two ships lost and ... I don 't care about casualties . A leviathan transporting prisoners does not escape while in my custody . Has my brother returned yet ? I will dispatch him in the rear battle fighter to track her down . Sir , this is playback from the recon satellite monitoring the pursuit of the leviathan . What manner of craft is that ? My brother 's prowler . I 'm sure that he ... We lost a second ship , sir . It was absorbed into the leviathan when it went into starburst . I want to see him . See him , sir ? Peel back the image . I want to see who is inside . We 've done it ! We 've escaped ! One prowler traveled with us . Block its radio , net it and bring it aboard . As good as done . Pilot , does moya know where we are ? Yes , of course . We 're someplace else . I 'll get back to you on the specifics . At least we are free . What is the matter with you people ? ! This damned leviathan has no idea where we are . I am Pa 'u Zotah Zhaan . And you ? Ka D 'argo . You are delvian . A priest . I 've heard of your kind 's practices . Your appetites . Such as ? I 've heard of something known as ... The , uh , fourth sensation . I have experienced this . Not lately . Oh . Why , why were you , uh why have you , uh ... ? Imprisoned ? Because on my home world , even among my kind I was something of an anarchist . Actually , I was the leading anarchist . And you ? I killed a fellow soldier . My commanding officer . How old are you ? 30 cycles . You are but a boy . I am not . I am a luxan warrior . I have seen two battle campaigns . Only two ? You know peacekeeper coding ? Yes . I spent three cycles on a maximum labour planet . Which one ? Mekkar 7 . Assigned to peacekeeper intellilan interface . I was on mekkar 7 . Truly ? In the ninety third level . In the kemlac mines . Why aren 't you dead ? I often ask myself the same question . I watched so many others die while the peacekeepers looked on . Somehow it made me stronger . I suppose the warrior in me became too strong not to survive . Perhaps you survived for this . This escape ? I doubt it will last long enough for the peacekeepers even to note it in their log . Not the escape itself , but what we pray will be the result . Freedom . That is a very delvian way to look at the situation . I am nothing if not a product of my upbringing . And I of mine . Then perhaps together a warrior and a priest can help save each other . Oh , please , let it all be a dream ... A very bad and very twisted dream . What , um ... Where ... ? Where are my clothes ? Hey ! Why did you take off my clothes ? I am Rygel the 16th dominar to over 600 billion people . I don 't need to talk to you . I thought you were a prisoner . Falsely imprisoned . My cousin , bishan stole my throne from me while I slept . A mistake I will soon be correcting . Your garments were removed so that we could examine you . " Examine " ? Examine me ? How ? Where ? Wait a minute . One of those mechanical things of yours injected me right here . Translator microbes . " Microbes " ? They colonize at the base of the brain . Allow us to understand each other . Why you weren 't injected at birth I cannot fathom . " Colonize ... " Brain " ... Why have you got me locked in here ? I 'm not here to harm you . Hell , I wouldn 't know how to harm you . We can no more trust you than we can trust that . Hl ... My name 's John . What is your rank and regiment ? And why are you out of uniform ? Rank and regiment now . Let me out of here , you hynerian slug . Your efforts are wasted , peacekeeper . You , of all people , should know that . Peacekeeper ? You were one of those out there attacking the ship . They think I 'm one of you ? Officer Aeryn Sun . Special peacekeeper commando . Icarion company , pleisar regiment . Identify yourself . My rank is commander . I 'm not military . At least not any military you know . I 'm a damn scientist . Mmm ? Mmm . Hmm . It 's been so long . Our possessions - my blade . Hands off , luxan . Ah , you 're awake , both of you . What 's the problem , my dear ? You should be used to viewing the likes of us through bars . You need to listen to me . I 'm not what you think I am . Not a peacekeeper ? Yes , we know that now . You have some decidedly unfamiliar bacteria living within you . I 'm from a planet called earth . I 'm human . Homo sapiens sapien . It 's time for us to eat . Eat what ? Whoever killed my brother will pay dearly . Captain ... The techs are completing the imaging of the module 's pilot . Show me . On the final sweep now , sir . He 's sebacean . Inform the rear battle fighter . They will take charge of the armada . We are going after the leviathan . But sir , regulations ... That is a direct order lieutenant . I 'm not a peacekeeper . Can you get this off my wrists ? We do not know your loyalties . My loyalties ... I just got here . You 're the first alien contact anybody from my planet has ever made . We dreamed about it , made movies about it ... By the way , what part of the universe are we in ? Are we still in orion 's arm ? Still in the milky way ? You have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? I need to see some star charts . Get some common points of reference ... damn ! This ship is amazing . What kind of ... ? She 's a leviathan . A bio-mechanoid . A living ship . You blame me ? If I hadn 't pulled those wires your precious moya would still be wearing that control collar . But in doing so you also caused moya to hemorrhage most of her iriscentant fluid . Leading to what result , pilot ? Leading to our current maximum speed which is barely hetch two . Moya and I don 't want to return ... Why are they doing this ? Feeding us . They 'll need information if they 're going to survive . They 're hoping we 'll provide it . I 'd eat if I were you . It may be the only chance ... We get . We ? The ship 's pilot just informed us that we are approaching an inhabited system with a commerce planet . A commerce planet ! Excellent . We need many things . Hynerian cream soap , definitely . Some fresh janeray syrup to get rid of the taste of these food cubes ... - We need iriscentant fluid . How dare you , you luxan slime ! Silence , your eminence . I 've been searching for a reason not to jettison you with the refuse dump . You 'd dump me ? ! I bribed the maintenance drones at the last checkpoint ! I secured the cell codes ... - Gentlemen ... Gentlemen , I suggest we focus on the situation at hand . Before we approach this planet , we must know ... Is there peacekeeper presence in this system ? I don 't know . Wish I did . We are wasting time we do not have . She is infantry . Peacekeeper command tells her where to fight and die . This one ... is some kind of higher brain function deficient . How he escaped the genetic sieving process I do not know . Rygel ? What just happened ? It 's a natural bodily function . And it 's odorless . So your loyal subjects tell you . You fart helium ? Sometimes . When I 'm nervous ... or angry . Attention - I thought you would want to know we are entering planetary orbit . Thank you , pilot . Crichton hey ! You know , you only expose your ignorance if you don 't concede knowledge of the hurlian stone . 20 . 20 barrels of fluid ! There was a time when you 'd have been disemboweled with a dull lashlan spade for half such an insult to me . 35 ? Boy , was Spielberg ever wrong . Close encounters , my ass . Wormhole ... I must have come in through a ... I must have come in through a wormhole . Yeah . So if I did come here through a wormhole the only way that I 'm going to get back is to ... Find another wormhole . Or to create one . Yeah . Right . Look ... You want to make one of these wormhole things of yours ? How do you expect to do that from inside this cell ? Come on , move faster . What are you doing ? I 'm going to sabotage this ship . Sabotage ? Give me a break . They haven 't hurt us . How about we show ' em a little compassion ? Compassion ? What is compassion ? Compassion ? What , you 're kidding , right ? It 's a feeling that you have when you see someone else 's pain and instead of taking advantage of their weakness you help them . Oh , I know this feeling . Yeah , well , it is a fairly common human feeling . Mmm . I hate it . You know what ? I 'm on the wrong team here . I 'm just going to stay . Fine . Do what you want . But if you stay with these lowlifes , you 'll die with them . Yeah , well , how do I know I can trust you ? You don 't . That 's just another thing you don t know . Damn ! What is that ? That 's cutting edge technology . We 're taking mine . Captain ! We are receiving a transmission from one of the outer systems . It 's Aeryn Sun , the prowler pilot we thought we 'd lost . She was taken captive aboard the leviathan , but she 's escaped . She has the being from the white pod with her . I 'm on another planet . Yes , pilot . Understood . The female peacekeeper and the human have just escaped and there 's a full command carrier on approach to this planet . A full carrier ? Crais ... But it makes no sense for him to come after us himself . Unless the two who just escaped are something very special . This barter session is over . Trouble . We must go . Hmm ... what are you asking for those wellan glow crystals ... Whoa ! Come on . I 've relayed our rendezvous point . We can get off this waste hole of a planet . That 's the leviathan 's pod . They 're getting away . Come on , we have to report it . Aren 't we about to be rescued ? They are no danger to us , right ? They 're prisoners . Escaped prisoners . They must be recaptured . Or destroyed . Do not tempt me . You need to get out of here . There 's a shipful of peacekeepers on its way here right now . Traitor . That is why I want you both aboard moya as insurance . Just go before ... You are such fools . I will not fall for such an ancient ruse . But fall you will , luxan . If the luxan gives you any trouble kill him . Captain Crais . Name ? It 's , uh , John Crichton . And where are you from ... John Crichton ? Sir , he claims to be a human from a planet called erp . But he 's shown himself ... To be what ? A clever impostor . An accomplice to a ship full of escaping prisoners . My brother 's murderer . Your brother 's what ? You charged my brother 's prowler in that white death pod of yours . You talking about that near miss I had the first minute I got here ? That was an accident . That was no near miss for my brother . A human ? That will require some study . I will personally enjoy pulling you apart to see what you 're made of . Hey ! Wait . Yes , officer Sun ? You know something about this alien ? Only that I have spent time with him , sir and I believe that what happened to your brother was an accident . I don 't believe he is brave enough or intelligent enough to attack one of our prowlers intentionally . Exactly how much time have you spent with this human ? Not a lot . Not much at all . Because , as you know peacekeeper high command has very clear parameters regarding contact with unclassified alien life-forms . You may have very well exceeded those parameters , officer Sun . Which would make you irreversibly contaminated . No , sir ... Take them all away . Prepare them for transit while we locate the prisoners . Warrior to warrior I vow one day I will kill you . Keep moving . Come on . Pilot , how 's it coming ? Fluid tanks are nearly full . Should be another minute or two . Any word from D 'argo ? None . I 'm sorry . Mm . Right . Turn around . Over there . Stand still . What is this thing ? It 's a toy . A puzzle . You have to figure out how to take it apart and put it back together . A field resourcefulness exercise ? Yeah , something like that . Here . You pull that loop through there . Yeah , that one . Good . Now figure how to put it back together again . It 's a weapon , you fool . Give it here before you activate it . Don 't do that . Hey ! Hey , you ! Freeze ! Don 't move or I 'll fill you full of ... Little yellow bolts of light . Throw me the key . Now , on the ground . Give up now , officer Sun . You might avoid the death sentence . Unlock me and then I will unlock you . No , me . Come on , there isn 't time . Unlock me . Down ! If you run , you 're going to have to find someone else to unlock you . Then you 're going to have to explain these peacekeeper handcuffs . Give up now , officer Sun . You might avoid a death sentence . Now unlock me . No , he is a criminal . We all are . Officer Sun , they are - can you get me away from here ? What ? Can you get me off this rock , away from these over-amped rent-a-cops ? Away from Crais ? And we take her , too . What ? Never . I will take you . You are manageable ... If she stays , we all stay . No . I will not come with you . You 've been irreversibly contaminated , remember ? It means death . It is my duty . My breeding since birth . It 's what I am . You can be more . Say again , pilot . It is D 'argo in the arriving prowler . He is telling us to leave orbit immediately . Thank khalaan . The peacekeeper female and that ... other one are with him . Can 't you see he 's under duress . It 's a trap ! I 'll take him in the tr ... Pilot break orbit . Destination ? The uncharted territories . I 'll explain later . Your attention . Distance between the pursuing peacekeeper carrier and moya : 60 metras and closing . They are bringing around their frag cannons . " Frag cannons ? " What is the range of their frag cannons ? I 'm afraid neither moya nor I is sufficiently conversant with peacekeeper technology . 45 metras . Let 's just do another one of those starburst things . There 's no time . The leviathan must restore her energy reserves . 50 metras . I need paper . Paper ? To write on . Turn this ship around . We have to go back toward the planet . Go back to the planet ? ! Frag cannons are locking on . Crichton , what are you doing ? It 's a theory . It has to do with overcoming atmospheric friction . Are you completely insane ? ! Listen , we 're going to have to hit a pretty exact trajectory . Can you do that ? I 'm doing all that I can maintaining moya 's regular systems at this speed . Well , can this ship thing be flown manually ? Manually ? Yes , but there are ... Good . You do it . I am not trained as a pilot . Fine . You 're the experienced pilot . You fly . No . This is madness ! Weapons control , full charge . It appears our only alternative is death . What a charmer . Pilot , give me maneuverability now ! We may dodge one shot , but never ... Do it ! Do it ! Fire . Target is banking . Reacquire . Banking towards us . She 's accelerating , sir . We end this now . Just go for the maximum , and let the planet 's gravity pull us in . Hetch 9 ! Dive straight into the atmosphere . 28 to 38 degrees . You got it ? Do it ! You 've got to do it ! More speed to slingshot us out . We are there . Sir , the leviathan , she 's ... I can see that , lieutenant . Pull out . Pull out now . She 's off our scanners , sir . We 've lost her . It 's gone . Thank you . It 's gone . You can let go now , John . Thank you . We need to talk . Get your hands off me . You have a warrior 's instinct . Good . We 'll need that . Cool . I have spent eight degrading cycles aboard this ship and now I am finally liberated . Congratulations . I don 't know who you are where you 're from , or what you want but if you threaten my freedom I 'll kill you . They 're a brutal race . Uncivilized . Indiscriminate in their deployment of violence . Right . Unlike your people . My people might have helped you if you hadn 't put us into this position . Me ? No , no , no . Try your boy Crais . So , you haven 't forgotten about him . I know he hasn 't forgotten about you . Yeah , well , the , uh transparent purple guy - what 's his name , pilot ? He said we 've passed into the uncharted territories and that your people don 't have jurisdiction . Crais thinks you killed his brother . In such a case would you obey jurisdictional boundaries ? Listen to me . If you want to live choose your allegiances carefully . That 's not to say that there 's any guarantees there . Come here . I 'm not going to hurt you . Come here . Hey , dad it worked . D.K. ' s and my theory - it actually worked . Sort of . Look , I know this is , uh , crazy . I mean , you 're never going to get this message but I just wanted to let you know that I 'm alive . Oh , hold still . Hold still . Don 't know where I am . Technically , I don 't know how I got here , but ... I 'm not going to stop trying to get home . See ? You 're fixed . Go play . Hey what the hell are you doing ? Your equipment may be worth something in trade . My equipment . It 's mine . Are you a sound sleeper ? And there 's life out here , dad . Weird , amazing ... Psychotic life ... And , uh ... In technicolor . Hey , dad , you know those ... Rattlers in the stomach we talked about ? Well , I got ' em now .

 You just missed him . Only been gone a couple days . I 'll check the dresser . How did he look ? Oh . About 6 ' 2 " , 170 pounds , I guess . That 's not what I mean . I mean , was he okay ? Did he seem in good health ? Are you kiddin ' ? Man had a physique the pros would kill for . So , tell me , uh , if Mr. Spitz wasn 't really an atomic engineer ... how did he stop the nuke plant from turning ' us into pork rind ? - Mr. Spitz is , um ... - A fascinating man . Oh . So , any stab atJarod 's Oedipal tragedy , Dr. Freud ? Jarod . That was his first name , yeah . Strange ... but you 'd think a grown man with a last name of Spitz ... would already know how to swim , wouldn 't ya ? He was here for swimming lessons ? Hey , we are the " Y. " He was a quick learner too . From Pike to Advanced Adult in just five weeks . Day in , day out , swimming was all he did . Except for this past week . He spent every second in the pool , but he didn 't swim a stroke . What do you mean ? From the time we opened in the morning until the midnight crew closed her down ... he 'd be there in the deep end ... treading water without ever stopping . Just treading water . I wonder what your science project is up to now . Banking two-niner and heading down . Go in for a closer look . It 's smoking pretty badly . I 'll call in a rescue craft . She 's going overboard . There 's no time ! Jarod , no . ! Come on , Jarod . Hello . My name is Jarod . You 're gonna be just fine . Miss Parker , you have a fax . 1,324 . Very good , girls , and absolutely correct . Sydney , now ! Your theatrics upset the children . Save the Mr. Rogers , Syd . I set up a text session with Broots so that he can help us trackJarod . I think that takes precedence over Thing 1 and Thing 2 . Broots 's technology isn 't going to help us track a chameleon . Jarod changes color . He blends in . We 'll get close when he lets us . Patience , Parker . We need patience . Syd , patience may be a soothing catchall ... for the potato heads in Psychogenic Services . But my father and the boys in the Tower equate patience with failure . ButJarod is a Pretender . He can become anyone he wants to be . We 'll never catch him with one of Broots 's phone taps . That 's what they said about the Unabomber , Syd . And how did they catch that whacked-out prodigy ? A letter to Mommy . It 's the smart ones who always do something stupid . Let 's use the stairs . It 's only three flights up . Come on . Stop nurturing , Sydney . Hell , it 's been 20 years . I don 't have any problem riding this elevator . You shouldn 't either . Your mother was a special person . My mother was weak . Period . She couldn 't handle the pressures of S.I.S. or this place . I don 't have that problem . Only thing that ever bothered me was ... why in an elevator ? They go up , they go down . They end up nowhere . It 's amazing how a single bullet can change your life . If you ever want to talk about it ... Correct me if I 'm wrong , Sydney , but wasn 't my mother 's session with you ... one of the last things she did before she got on this elevator ? No , thanks . Sydney , I 'll take my own chances . Martha . Good morning . - You look way too rested to be staying in Coast Guard housing . - I live off-base . It took three years and a husband to get me out of the iron cot . - How 'd you swing it ? - I forged my transfer papers . Oh . Martha , are you okay ? Yeah , it 's uh , bad sushi . - Is there any other kind ? - Lieutenant Campbell . Good morning . - Good morning . - I 'm glad I caught you . I wanted you to meet my lieutenant commander , Paul Bilson . - Pleasure to meet you , sir . - Word is you did some pretty good work out there yesterday . Heard you even plucked a victim out of the soup . Well , it 's a good thing I took those swim lessons at the " Y. " I wish all my transfers had your humility , not to mention talent . Commander Powell , I was hoping to get a few minutes regarding my rank review . - Well , all rank reviews go through the L.C. - I know . It 's on my desk . - I 'll get on it A.S.A.P. - Thank you , sir . Well , I 'll leave you in abler hands , Lt. Campbell . Thank you , sir . Well , the real question is , what kind of sea legs do you have ? As you know , anybody can fly , right , Poole ? A kite maybe , sir . Lieutenant . Good morning , L.C. Hey , got the Christi purring ' like a kitten . - I don 't trust that old nag . I 'll take the 45 . - Yes , sir ! Commander Powell likes his men to be real sailors . You up for some sea duty ? - As ready as I 'll ever be , sir . - Javi , we 're waiting ! Rumble Base Alpha signing off . Haven 't you ever heard of the Internet ? E-mail ? - I 'm a purist . I crave static . - You comin ' ? Yeah . - Hi . Jarod Campbell . - Javi Padilla . Nice to meet you . Is Bilson always in such a hurry ? Only when the ocean calls . Commander Powell tells me you 've been running icebreakers off Katima Bay . Great Lakes ? You didn 't tell me this was a freshwater boy , sir . Ah , give me a break . At least I transferred to the unit ... with the best S.A.R. record in the Guard . You 're damn right . We conducted 178 search-and-rescues last year alone . Whoo . ! Looks like a 42-80 to me . It 's listing about three degrees . Abandoned ? That 's my guess . Javi , call it in . Jarod , check it out . Hello ? It 's the Coast Guard . Is anybody here ? Hello ? Whoa , now , sir . Nobody 's here to hurt you . Oh , hell . Roy Abbott , say hello to Lt. Campbell . Hi . Call meJarod . Get off my boat . Ah , come on , Roy . Is that any way to treat the new guy ? Sir . Your stores appear to be low , and you also appear to be taking on water . Why don 't you let us tow you ashore so we can help you resupply ? Nothin ' I need over there . I 'm fine where I am . Mr. Abbott , the commander did not agree . You have one week to come in , or we 're authorized to bring you in , sir . It 's for your own good , Mr. Abbott . Sydney . Well , I 'm surprised you 're not out making rounds down Corridor 15 . Even a psychiatrist needs a day off . And all this time , I thought your interest in me was purely paternal . I understand learning to swim , but aren 't you a little old ... to be playing with bathtub toys ? Well , it 's certainly better than the kind of playtime you foisted upon me . It 's funny . I can 't see their faces . But their eyes ... they won 't stop staring at me . - Whose eyes , Jarod ? - I don 't know . Dead eyes . Eyes of people that aren 't alive today ... because of how you exploited my simulations . And now , you want to right those wrongs ... by using your gift as an avenging angel . - Is that it ? - Something like that . Then why are you calling ? I wanted to know if ... ifJarod was my real name . I think it is . At least , that 's what I was told . Thank you , Sydney . Don 't hang up . I 'm worried about you . If you 're so worried about me , why don 't you go to the authorities ? - You know I can 't do that . - Why ? Because you love me ? Or because you 're afraid of what I know ? Jarod , if those people from the beltway find out what you have ... I won 't be able to protect you . If they find out what I have ... you won 't be able to protect yourselves . Those D.S.A. ' s contain my work . No , Sydney . They contain my life . Good-bye . We got you , genius . Now this is very interesting . You mean somebody actually manufactures ... imitation canine feces ? Yep . Only they couldn 't fit all that on the label ... so they just call it fake dog poop . Oh . And why exactly would somebody want fake dog poop ? 'Cause it 's funny . - Oh . - No , I mean the white ones . Yeah . Thank you . It is funny . I got the white ones , Mommy . Those were his favorites . Broots traced Jarod 's call back to this Y.M.C.A. Get him ! Hey , hey , hey ! I ain 't done nothin ' . I ain 't done nothin ' . What are you doing in this room ? I ain 't trespassing ' . No . This guy gave me the room . - Is this the man ? - Yeah , that-that 's him . And you know what ? He conducts the philharmonic . Mm-hmm . And-And he gives me six months free rentjust to transfer his calls . And you know what ? He says he likes to travel a lot . Shut up , Sydney . Good morning , Mr. Abbott . What do you want ? I don 't know . I was just passing through . Permission to come aboard ? Granted . Magdeline 's a pretty lady . How do you know Magdeline ? I was talking about your boat . Is that your wife ? Could 've been . Probably would 've . I never asked her . Do you think the Dutchman ever found his lost love ? What ? The opera you were listening to . Wagner 's Dutchman . That 's the story . I always wondered ... if he ever searched for his love ... or spent the rest of his days floating around on that ghost ship . I never really gave it much thought . It 's not easy wondering if someone you love is still out there . I ain 't moving ' my boat . I 'm not asking you to . Don 't that uniform make it your job ? I 'm just borrowing the uniform . I brought you some supplies from town . I 'll trade you for ... this chest you carved . Throw in some candles next time you pass , you got yourself a deal . Done . Thanks . Do you ever listen to Mozart , Mr. Abbott ? The Magic Flute ? I like this one fine . It 's all I need . I was allowed to listen to it once when I was a child . I 'd close my eyes , and in my mind ... I became an eagle . I could go anywhere , do anything . Nothing could stop me . Maybe Mozart knew something that Wagner didn 't . I ain 't moving ' my boat . Lt. Campbell , even on routine patrol ... I expect your eyes on the deck . This is a helicopter , not a library . Trying to orient myself to the West Coast ocean search patterns . Tell you what . I will buy you lunch ... if you let me pick your brain about some of these old searches . As long as it 's not sushi . Great . I don 't want Commander Powell ... to tag me " Freshwater Boy " on my rank review . Wait a minute . You 've been here three days , and you 're getting a rank review ? Oh , great ! All I need is another guy in this operation ... - elbowing for room on the ladder . - When are you due ? I should 've made L.C. months ago ... but Commander Powell keeps putting it off . Not your promotion . Your baby . I 'd say from your nausea and your sore back , you 're about nine weeks . My husband doesn 't even know . What are you , a part-time obstetrician ? No , but I was a midwife once . You haven 't told the commander yet , have you ? Hell no ! If Powell or anyone else around here finds out about this ... I can kiss away my chances at L.C. Your secret 's safe with me . Well , Broots , what happened ? I 'm backtracking his call through the other phone . All I know right now is that they 're all international landlines . - I didn 't even know that was possible . - How long to trace it ? Uh , that 's hard to say . I mean , Jarod 's method is so basic , so simple . Uh , 20 ... 24 hours . You have 12 . I can do it in eight . The King file ? You certainly picked a sensitive one . It 's all downhill after this . You-You should talk to Bilson . This was his baby . - How so ? - Well , it happened during his regular Tuesday night patrol . So , Bilson was in charge . It was a tough one too . No one was sure how King 's boat went down . Never did find it . This one was particularly sad . Coroner said Tom King treaded water a day and a half before he drowned . For an S.A.R. team that 's come up empty ... that 's the kind of news that hurts the most . This report says that the search patterns were based ... on water current information provided by directional buoys . Yep . I dropped them myself . Here . Pilcher 's Point . That 's the area Tom King was known to have been fishing in . So Bilson deployed standard grid searches southeast of that point ? That 's S.O.P. You seem to be following this fine . What is the matter ? According to satellite monitoring ... the D.F. buoys indicated that the current was moving southwest . - You 're doing it wrong . - Hmm ? Didn 't you ever eat cookies as a kid ? They didn 't have cookies where I grew up . Where 'd you grow up ... Mars ? Sort of . First , you twist the cookie ... so the top comes off like a little lid . Then , you get all the white stuff off . I pick it with my teeth , but you can scrape it or lick it . Then what do you do with the brown part ? Grown-ups put it in ice cream . Why don 't they just sell the white stuff ? It wouldn 't be any fun . Hmm . Your mom works hard . Since my dad died , that 's all she does . He 's with St. Andrew ... the one for fishermen . I got my dad a statue of him at church . It was on his boat . They never found that . It 's hard to lose a parent . I know . What part do you miss the most ? My mom 's smile . - I can 't figure it out . ! - You have to . How much oxygen is left ? Less than 48 hours . Well , what caused the explosion ? - We don 't know ! - Fuel . Oxygen . There 's nothing that can save us ! - It 's your duty to save your crew ! - No ! I can 't do it ! You shut down now , you all die ! Come on , Jarod ! Think ! Wait ! Wait ! I 've got it ! I 've got it ! I can use the gravitational pull of the moon to help get us back . Very good , Jarod . I knew you would save them if you wanted to . They didn 't want to save Tom King . They wanted him to die . What ? Oh ! I intentionally wake you in your deepest sleep phase ... and all I get is a lifeless " what " ? You want wit , read Noel Coward . What time is it where you are ? Cute . Not funny , but cute . You 're making house calls now . I 'm honored . Well , I was feeling a little guilty about my virtual phone game . You know , I really should tape this to replay at the Christmas party . You 'll be there , you know , rest assured . - I 'm not resting much at all these days . - Breaking my heart . So , Jarod ... why the Y.M.C.A. ? I was watching retro night on VH1 , and they were doing the ' 70s ... which , as you know , I missed . There was this singing group that was extolling the virtues of staying at the " Y. " So , here I am . Cute . Not funny , but cute . Did you know that they make fake dog poop ? It 's amazing ... how it appears to be one thing ... but it 's really something completely different . And I should care because ... Well , this sort of thing could be a real moneymaker for the Centre . Besides , isn 't it the perfect metaphor ... for the way your father and the Centre distort the truth ? - And what truth is that , Jarod ? - It 's all in the note I sent you . The truth about what makes you sad . I doubt the boys back at Katima Bay are sittin ' beach-side this time of year . Probably freezing their butts off on some futile cape-hopping S.A.R. So , um , beside the obvious , why pull up stakes ? Well , I was feeling kind of cooped up where I was living . So I decided to head out west . I interviewed at the Channel Islands Station first ... but I decided that this was the spot for me . Well , you made the right decision . The Channel Islands is full of our rejects . - That 's funny . - Here you go , sir . They said that this group was a bunch of renegades . That 's a crock . They said guys who couldn 't rescue a fisherman from their own bay ... didn 't deserve to wear the uniform . Were they talking about the King rescue ? Yes , I think that was the name they used . Did something go wrong ? You know , it 's amazing how the people we put our lives on the line for ... can just turn around and smear the Guard with one news story . The man 's wife took it hard . She blamed us . I understand her tragedy . I guess she had to blame somebody , so she could deal with it . I promise you . We did everything we could do to save that man . We did our job . Pilcher 's Point is where Tom King ... was known to have been fishing . The current was going southwest . No one was sure how King 's boat went down . Never did find it . What ? I 'm on my way . It wasn 't easy , but l-I have to admit ... figuring Jarod 's mind is a real treat . - He 's a damn clever guy . - He 's a one-man Siegfried and Roy . - Show me what you have . - Okay . We backtracked the call we thought was coming from this Y.M.C. A ... from Jarod 's room ... Room 334 . Jarod interconnected 173 international calls ... but-but backtracking those calls was impossible ... because instead of a call-forwarding device triggered by a single call ... all 173 calls ... were individually initiated . Ingenious . And a hell of a lot of work forJarod , I might add , and very expensive . I don 't care what it cost . Oh , that 's good , because Jarod charged it to your calling card . Where is he ? Oh , the-the last place we would expect to look . - Room 335 . - In the same " Y " ? Yeah , in the very next room . Gotcha . I found this at a novelty shop on the pier . - Yeah , very funny . - Just when you think it 's your lucky day ... you find out it 's not . So , what are you doing here ? Same as you . Looking for peace of mind . And the answer to why she 'll never see her father again . - Who the hell are you , huh ? - I don 't really know . But last night I became you ... and I realized why you come here so much ... why you feel so guilty ... and why you and Bilson didn 't save her father 's life . We searched for him for two days . But you made sure that the search was in areas that you knew he wouldn 't be found . You couldn 't afford for him to be found alive , could you ? You don 't know what the hell you 're talking about ! I know you and Bilson make the same patrol on the south sector every Tuesday night . And every Wednesday afternoon , you make a rather sizable deposit ... into your private account on Coronado . So what kind of contraband were you running ? - You 're crazy , man . - Am I ? The paint on the hull . It 's gonna match the rescue cruiser that you and Bilson were in ... the night that he went down . You can search everywhere you want for salvation . The only place you 're gonna find it is in the truth you 're running from . Me and Bilson meet a Mexican hauler ... named the Santa Marca every Tuesday night ... bringing in a shipment of something . I think it 's rock , but I 'm not positive . We 're just paid delivery boys . I don 't know how we hit his boat . I mean , it was foggy . I just-just couldn 't see it . But we sheared it right in half . And then ... Then I swung around and ... and I spotted him in the water . He was still alive . Yeah . And he looked up at me , and ... and all I can think was ... " What a small world , " you know ? I used to see him with his daughter and his wife at Mass ... and I think he recognized me too . And then he put his hand up to me . So I tried to pull him on board ... but Bilson stopped me . He literally put a gun to my head and told me to leave him . - And if you saved him ... - That we 'd go to jail . But I 'll take prison in a heartbeat ... if I can get out of this hell I 'm in . Hey , could you do me a favor ? Now , that 's funny . I 'm sorry I 'm late , sir . - Late for what ? - Patrol . I just got the call this morning about riding with you . - Riding with me ? Where 's Javi ? - I don 't know , sir . They told me he was sick . - Sick ? - Actually , I 'm not feeling very well myself . Bad sushi . Do you mind if I hit the head and catch up with you ? Nah , sure , sure . Is there something wrong ? No , everything 's great . All right . I will see you in a minute . - Where 's 45 ? - I guess it 's on patrol . The Christi 's ... Yeah , purring . I know . Javi ? Santa Marca to Robin 247 . Santa Marca to Robin 247 . Come in , 247 . Are you insane ? We don 't have scheduled radio contact until tonight . We 're confirming we got your message . At your request , the rendezvous will be at 10 : 00 a.m. today . You will be there , Javi ? Hello ? Javi ? Right . Today . I 'll be there . Adios . Well , there you are , sir . I 'm ready if you are . Oh , that 's all right , Lieutenant . It 's-It 's a routine patrol . - I 'll do it alone . - Are you sure , sir ? - Yeah , yeah . Go take care of your gut . - Well , thank you , sir . You didn 't tell us he lived next door . You didn 't ask . Paint . Come on . Excuse me . Have either of you seen this man ? Well , that 's great . That 's just great . Purring like a damn kitten . Robin 247 to Santa Marca . Come in , Santa Marca . Rescue 45 , come in . Is that you , Javi ? Rescue 45 , you 're on a direct course to my craft . Veer off . Rescue 45 , veer off ! Rescue 45 , you 're coming right at me ! Rescue 45 , veer off ! Hey ! - Oh , my God ! - What the hell 's wrong with you , man ? - You blind or somethin ' ? Come on ! Toss me a line ! - I can 't , sir . - What ? - I 'm sorry , but I can 't rescue you . You 're bucking for a court-martial , Lieutenant ! Well , that is serious , sir . But , you see , a court-martial , it won 't exactly affect me . I 'm not really a lieutenant . The truth is ... I 'm not really in the Coast Guard . You get me out of here ! Oh , don 't worry . You 'll be okay . Men have been known to tread water for days . - This isn 't funny ! - Oh , you 're right . It 's terrifying . You 're all alone . You can 't see anything but water ... and you start thinking about what might be down there ... whatjust bumped you below the suryace . But after a while , your nerves will settle down . But , unfortunately , that 's when your body starts to ache ... and the only way to stop the pain ... is to stop treading . But then you start to sink . And in that instant between life and death ... you think about all the people and all the things you left behind . So you start fighting your way back to the suryace . You fight for your life . - You can 't leave me here ! - Sure , I can . Just like you left Tom King . No . ! No ! Excuse me , sir . There 's something you have to see . What 's this ? It 's the truth , sir . Rescue Unit 45 to Base . Requesting pickup near D.F. buoy number 29 . But take your time getting there . Just a little floating debris . There he is ! Hello , Jarod ! Hello , Sydney ! Give that to me ! There 's nowhere to go this time ! Sydney raised me to believe my mind can take me anywhere ! He 's out of fuel . Like I told you , Sydney . The smart ones always do something stupid . Get him . - He 's not there ? - How ? I don 't know . But he left you this . - Hiya , Roy ! - Jarod ? Nice day for a swim ! - What 's that , Sydney ? - I don 't know . No ! No ! - They 're trying to hurt her ! - Stay here , Jarod . - No ! - Get her out of the elevator ! Stop it . ! - Get the kid out of here ! - Stop ! - Mama ! - No , keep her back ! Keep her back ! - Leave me alone ! - No . ! Mama . ! It 's me . I wanna know what really happened to my mom . - Thanks , Roy . - It ain 't nothin ' . Magdeline 's out there somewhere . What are you gonna do ? I think I 'll take a walk . Thank you . How about you ? I think I 'll take a drive . Gentlemen , start your engines . ! Okay , Jarod , you 're set .

 It 's just a damn passport photo . It 's not the cover of Vogue . There 's no reason I have to look like hell in it , is there ? Settle down . - We 're on a schedule here . - I know we 're on a schedule here . Act natural . I 'll be back in ten . Make it five . I 'll be around back . Relax , Billy . Lower it just a bit . Yeah , that 's it . Now , big smile . Yeah , hold it . - Big trip you got planned ? - Oh , you know , nothin ' special . Just good to have a passport . It looks like it 's clearing up . It might be a nice day after all . - [ Chuckles ] - It 's just gonna take a few minutes . [ Bell Dings ] That comes to 6.95 . Oh , great . I left my money in the car . - I 'll be back . - I 'll be here . [ Door bell Dings , Door Closes ] Ow ! Hey , you jerk ! What ? Billy ? Billy , someone did something to me . Billy ? [ Gasps ] [ Groaning ] [ Gasping ] [ Gasping Continues ] Shoot . My God ! X-Files Season 4 Episode 04 - Unruhe - No demand for ransom ? - No , unfortunately . It 's going on three days . [ Sighs ] Any additional leads ? No . No hair and fiber evidence either . The rain washed it all away . The autopsy did come back on the dead boyfriend though . It 's a puncture wound through the left eardrum ... and into the brain , possibly from a long needle or an awl . I 'm still not sure how you and I figure into this investigation . Did you see the photo ? Yeah . I assume that was taken by whoever it was who abducted her . It was taken by a 65-year-old druggist moments before she was abducted . That 's a passport photo from a local drugstore . The druggist who took that photo was the last known person to have seen Mary Lefante . Only he claims that wasn 't the photo he was taking . He says the photo he was taking was normal in every respect . He only came forward to the police when he heard the woman was missing . Well , whoever it was who took this photo was obviously privy to the woman 's abduction . That is what you would think . The damnedest thing . Here it is , just like I left it . It was under lock and key . - Is that where you keep it ? - Yeah . - Mind if I take a look ? - Please , help yourself . At first I thought I did something wrong when I took the picture . There 's that piece of paper you have to pull off . You have to do that just right . [ Mulder ] I 'm sure you did it just fine . - Your film 's out of date . - Is that against the law ? No . I was just making an observation . I don 't get much call for passport photos , you know ? The copy shop over at the mall does ' em cheaper . - [ phone Ringing ] - Excuse me . I sure hope you find that young woman safe and sound . [ Ringing Continues ] So , which one of us gets to use the stun gun on Bruno Hauptmann back there ? All right . So he doesn 't exactly stand out as a suspect . Mulder , take a look at this . You see this smeariness here ? I 'm thinking that it 's heat damage . With the heater sitting under the film right there , the emulsion probably melted . So you think that would make it look like she posed screaming for a passport photo ? - Plus , the film is two years out of date . - Oh . - The photographic chemistry could 've changed . The dyes ... fade . - Uh-huh . - They- - All right . So what 's your theory ? - I 'm not sure I have a theory . - [ Door bell Dings ] - [ police Radio Chatter ] - Excuse me . You the two FBI agents ? - Yeah , Agents Mulder and Scully . We 're sorry to have brought you all the way from Washington . We 're afraid we might have wasted your time . - [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] - [ police Radio Chatter ] Hey , Trott . [ Man ] Make sure you bag all that right there . [ Man # 2 ] Okay . - Take that out to my car . - He 's in the kitchen . Inspector Puett , these are Agents Scully and Mulder . - Agent . - Inspector . United States Postal Inspector . My office is investigating a mail theft , one which we 've traced to your missing person , - Ms. Mary Louise Lefante . - She was a postal employee . She works as a sorter at the Kurland Hills branch . Not coincidentally , a number of unsigned credit cards in transit through that branch ... never made it to their respective owners . Mary Lefante was intercepting them ? And her recently deceased boyfriend was signing them . We ran him . He was into forgery , check fraud , you name it . Mary Lefante 's passport photo . Do you know how soon she wanted to leave town ? - Did she know about your investigation ? - probably . Though we didn 't focus on her specifically until this week , after she came up missing . - And you think that she faked her own disappearance . - It looks that way to me . Yeah , but why would she stab her boyfriend through the ear ? The magic was gone ? Did you find a camera anywhere here ? So , you 're thinking this woman planted that photo of herself in the drugstore ? - What would be the point of that ? - I- - Here it is . Stand back , Scully . It 's loaded . - What are you doing ? - In the ' 60s , a bellhop named Ted Serios ... became kind of famous for taking what he called " thought-o-graphs . " He claimed that by concentrating on an unexposed film negative , he could create a photographic representation of what he saw in his mind . - He did landscapes , cathedrals , the queen of England . - Thought-o-graphs . They 're also known as " scotographs . " The literature on thought photography dates back almost to Louis Daguerre . So that makes it legitimate ? Look at that . [ Scully ] Oh , my God ! - I think he was here , Scully . - Who was here ? Mary Lefante 's abductor . I think he stalked her . He could have come up right here . I think he came in here , and he looked at her through the window this close . Close enough to affect the film in that camera . Psychic photography ? Mulder , I think that it 's obvious that somebody doctored these images ... and planted them to be found here . Maybe as some kind of a smoke screen . Meant to conceal what ? This isn 't about mail fraud . That 's just incidental . What if- - What if someone had this abiliry ? An image like this would be a peek into that person 's mind . Into their darkest fantasies ? The fantasy of a killer . [ Rustling ] [ Car Horn Honking ] [ Siren Blares ] [ police Radio Chatter ] She 's completely nonresponsive . We did a preliminary tox screen on her and found traces of morphine and scopolamine . - Twilite Sleep . - The dental anesthetic ? It 's basically a painkiller cocktail . It 's also for women in labor . - Would that account for her condition ? - No , it wouldn 't . [ Mulder ] What would ? Give her a P.E.T. scan . All set . Oh , my God ! What is it ? She 's been given what 's called a transorbital lobotomy . It used to be known as an " ice pick " lobotomy . It involves inserting a leukotome through the eye sockets . So we 're looking for a doctor ? - Someone with training ? - Not judging by this . Whoever did this , Mulder , did it wrong . [ Mary Weakly ] Un- - Un- - Unruhe . Unruhe . - [ Mulder ] Mary . - Un- - Un- - - You 'd better go in there and get her . - [ Mutters ] Unruhe . Unruhe . Unruhe . We just got the call . There 's been a second abduction . Unruhe . [ Man ] Unruhe . [ Man Speaking German ] - [ German Continues ] - [ Muffled Grunting ] [ Whimpering ] [ Rattling ] [ Muffled Screaming ] - [ Man ] You can roll . We 're set here . - [ Man ] Right . - [ Man ] Get that area taped off . - [ police Radio Chatter ] Watch it . Excuse me , ma 'am . - [ Camera Shutter Clicking ] - Mulder ? That 's Charles Selchik , certified public accountant . Dead from a stab wound through the ear . - Cleaning crew found the body . - What about the missing woman ? It 's his secretary , Alice Brandt , age 32 . The family confirms that she was working late last night . - What 's her connection to the first victim ? - Apparently none . But the M.O. remains the same . - Yeah . The clock is running . - Yeah . I keep thinking about that word that Mary Lefante was repeating- - " unruhe . " I checked the Michigan phone directory . It appears under three different spellings . - None within 80 miles of here . - It might be significant as a word . That 's what I 've been thinking . Apparently , in German it means " trouble " or " strife . " - Unrest . - You took German in high school , Scully ? - College . - " Unrest , " huh ? I 'm working on these crime scene photos from the first abduction . If we 're lucky , we 're dealing with someone ... who gets a vicarious thrill from returning to the scene of a crime . He wasn 't there , Scully . - How do you know ? - It would 've affected the photos . - Trott , what did you find ? - Nothing much . There 's no cameras or film here whatsoever . It 's all just accountants ' offices , so I don 't know why there would be . Is that what we 're looking for here , Mulder ? More evidence of psychic photography ? That may be the only evidence we get . I 've got a bureau forensics team coming up from Detroit . What 's here for them to find ? This guy 's obviously very good at what he does . He 's left behind no witnesses , no latent prints . The only thing he 's left are those photos , which leads me to believe he doesn 't even know he has that abiliry . We haven 't found any new psychic photos here either . Wait a second . I want to show you something . Right here . This . And look . It 's the same company . What if the kidnapper was working construction at both sites ? From these two vantage points , he would have been able to pick out the two women . - You may be right . Check it out . Let me know what you find . - Where are you gonna be ? I 'm gonna be back in D.C. I want Special Photo to run this . - I still think the answer 's in here . - What if it 's not , Mulder ? - This woman 's time is running out . - That 's all the more reason ... to fully investigate the one and only hard piece of evidence we do have . I 'll be in touch . - [ Foot steps Approaching ] - [ Muffled Whimpering ] - [ Speaking German ] - [ Whimpering Continues ] Get away ! Get away from me ! Get away from me , you bastard ! - Shh . - Let me go ! [ Sobbing ] - No , please , don 't ! - Shh . [ Speaking German ] [ Mulder ] Can you get rid of the blurriness surrounding her here ? Yeah . I just need to mark a place where the blur comes to a point ... and let the computer do its business . Bingo . Lord , look at that . - This guy 's an artist . - Why do you say that ? However he did this , however he put this together , it 's seamless . What about this face here ? Can you bring that up at all ? - Mmm . Wait a second . Let 's try- - - [ Keyboard Clacking ] - I think I can sweeten it more . - Okay , do that . - What have you got ? - We 're running the construction company employees . Eighteen workers overlapped on both job sites . - We 're checking the records now , but so far nothing . - What about day laborers ? Mr. Iskendarian there says that his company doesn 't hire workers off the books . - I don 't want any trouble with the I.R.S. - But his foreman might hire ... a little cash-only day labor without his knowledge . - He 's got seven job sites going now , as many foremen . - Gather officers to canvass . Which foreman was working the Midlothian Corporate Park ? - That job 's finished . - Find out where he is today . - I 'll take that one . - Can I use your phone ? Okay , thank you . N.C.I.C. shows no match for that man . What about this shape up here ? What is that ? [ Computer Mouse Clicking ] Can you take that and flip it so that that 's on the bottom ? Is that a shadow ? Yeah . It is . It 's somebody 's shadow . It 's the kidnapper 's shadow . It 's like he 's looming over her . It 's like he- - he 's standing over her . He means to pass judgment on her , like a god . Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? [ Thudding ] [ Clicking ] Hello ? Hi . Can I help you ? Uh , I hope so . Are you the foreman ? Yes , ma 'am . I 'm Gerry Schnauz . I 'm Special Agent Dana Scully . I 'd like to ask you some questions about the day laborers that you hire . - What , is this some I.R.S. thing or- - - No , sir , not at all . Well , my crew 's at lunch if you want to talk to anybody . But every body I 've got on today is on the books , as far as I know . - [ phone Ringing ] - Excuse me . Sorry . - Yeah , sure . - Scully . Scully , I may have something for you on the kidnapper . It 's , uh , something about his legs . - Yeah ? - They 're unusually long . They 're out of proportion . I 'm thinking he 's either very tall , or he 's not but wants to be . Scully ? Scully , are you there ? Unruhe . Stand where you are ! - [ Grunts ] - [ Clattering ] Don 't move ! Stop or I 'll shoot ! [ Breathing Heavily ] Lace your fingers behind your head . Do it ! [ Grunts ] Who ? Alice Brandt , the second woman that you abducted . That 's her name , Gerry . Where is Alice Brandt ? I don 't- - I have no earthly idea what you 're talking about . - Tell us where she is , Gerry . - I 'm sorry . This is a case of mistaken identity or something . I- - I honestly , honestly have no idea whar you 're talking about . Explain this . We were running Sheetrock today . I use that to start the holes in the Sheetrock to key hole in all the fixtures . - No . You used this to kill the two men . - What two men ? You used this on Mary Lefante ! Who ? W- - Wait . A minute ago it was Alice Brandt . I don 't believe this . I do not believe this is happening . You want to tell us about the first time you were arrested , Gerry ? In 1980 , you attacked your father with an ax handle . You beat him so severely that he spent the remainder of his life in a wheelchair . I was not jailed . I was institutionalized . I had a kind of chemical imbalance . [ Mulder ] Yeah . " Gerald Thomas Schnauz , diagnosed and treated for a paranoid schizophrenic disorder . Six years in Melvoyne Psychiatric Hospital . Released 1986 . " So , what you been up to since 1986 , Gerry ? Taking care of my father . Looking after him 24 hours a day . Making amends . He , uh , passed away in January . How did you feel about that ? Sad . It says here you have a sister . Where is your sister , Gerry ? She passed . Actually , it says here she committed suicide in 1980 . God , that was a bad year . What else happened in 1980 , Gerry ? Well , John Lennon got shot . Where the hell are you going with this ? What , are you Sigmund Freud ? - Why don 't you cut the B.S. ? - Then why don 't we get back to Alice Brandt ? Where is she ? You look troubled . Hey , Gerry ? Is this your father ? [ Chuckles ] Where 'd you get that ? You left that for me . You left it like a fingerprint . Is this what you see when you close your eyes ? Is that what you see ? [ Mouths Word ] Gerry , tell me where Alice Brandt is . She 's safe ... from the howlers . She 's all right now . Gerry , tell me how I can find her . [ Sirens Wailing ] - [ Men Shouting ] - Overhere ! All right . Let 'sgo ! Come on ! Come on ! Right up a head . [ Man ] Better get some tape . [ police Radio Chatter ] You know , Scully , that word " unruhe " - - unrest - - it 's bothering me . Maybe he thought he was curing them somehow . Saving them from damnation . From those things in the pictures . He called them the " howlers . " It 's over , Mulder . Then that photo wouldn 't be his fantasy . It would be his nightmare . What the hell does it matter ? - Because I want to know . - I don 't . [ EngineStarts ] [ Trott ] Okay , Gerry . Put it all in here- - wallet , jewelry , everything . - Eyes straight ahead . - [ Camera Whirring ] Let 's step over to the table . [ Machine Beeping ] What the hell ? [ Gunshot ] Mulder- - This wound 's in the wrong place . He was shot in the throat . He wasn 't trying to save this victim . We just got a report of a strong-armed robbery . It 's at the drugstore where the first victim disappeared . [ Chattering ] What happened ? [ Man ] We need to take your pulse . Thank you . It was Gerry . He took the passport camera and all the film in the store . He also took morphine , scopolamine hydrobromide and insulin syringes . - He 's making more Twilite Sleep . - He wants to continue his work . [ Beeping ] You know that job site that I arrested him at , Mulder ? What if he 's already picked out his next victim ? There were apartment buildings on all sides . - You think you interrupted his stalking ? - Let 's go . Hold on a second . Here , you bring the car around . I just want to wait for this . I 'll be right there . [ Dialing ] - Corning . - Corning . - Yeah . - Send units to the 300 block of Belmont Avenue . Check all of the apartments in the vicinity of that job site . I think he 's heading back there . - Got it . - Thanks . [ phone Beeps ] Ow ! [ Beeping ] Scully ! Scully ! Scully ! [ Chattering ] Sir ? Agent Scully 's Explorer just turned up . It 's abandoned at a Park and Ride about 20 miles up the U.S. 81 . - Any sightings ? - A report of an Audi stolen from the same lot . He 's switching cars . He 's gonna do that two or three times . He 's got six fingers here . Sir ? He 's got six fingers . What about his apartment ? We got a unit at his boarding house , but he ain 't coming back . What about friends , relatives , coworkers ? Does he have a summer house , winter house ? He doesn 't seem to have much of anything . We 're running a couple of phone numbers we found in his wallet . Let me see his wallet . It 's his father 's obituary . " Recipient of the Bronze Star Medal during the Korean War . Gerald Schnauz , Senior , D.D.S. " He was a retired dentist . [ Officer ] What 's there ? He was here . Why would he take the chair ? Let me go . Shh ! [ Speaking German ] It 's over , Gerry . Let me go right now . [ German Continues ] Yes , you do . Everybody does . But especially you . Why ? Why me , Gerry ? Do I remind you of your sister ? Why did your sister kill herself , Gerry ? What did your father do to her ? He didn 't do anything . It was the howlers . Okay . Then let 's talk about the howlers . They live inside your head . They make you do things and say things that you don 't mean . And all your good thoughts can 't wish them away . You need help . You 've got them ... right there . Don 't you feel them ? - I don 't have them , Gerry . - See ? They made you say that just now , because they know I 'm going to kill them . What if you 're wrong , Gerry ? What if there are no such things as howlers ? What if you made them up inside your head ... to explain the things your sister said your father did ? Great . Now they got you talking like Sigmund Freud . I am on to you ! I know your tricks ! Besides , I 've seen them ... in that picture that your partner showed me . Pictures don 't lie . You saw them too . If there are such things as howlers , Gerry , they live only inside your head . [ Ice pick Clangs ] [ Whirring ] [ Man ] I 'm in here . Six fingers , right ? - We 've got the state police looking as far- - - Why are there six ? What ? We 've got the state police looking as far south as Grand Rapids . Still no sign ofher . - Agent Mulder , what do we do ? - Damn it . One , two- - There 's five headstones . And the father makes six . Come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! [ Vehicles Approaching ] - [ police Radio Chatter ] - [ Men Shouting ] Yeah , right over there . [ Mulder ] Fan out ! Check the tree line ! What does- - What does this mean ? It means you need help , Gerry . No , I think what it means is that I don 't have much time left . [ Rattling ] [ Shuddering ] - No , Gerry , stop ! - Shh . - [ Muffled Cries ] - Shh . [ Creaking ] [ Muffled Cries Continue ] Scully ! Mulder ! [ ScullyShouting ] Mulder , help ! Mulder ! Scully ! - Are you hurt ? - No . [ Foot steps Approaching ] Get an ambulance ! [ Men Shouting in Distance ] [ Shouting Continues ] [ Scully 's Voice ] Addendum to case report . After his death , a diary was found among Gerald Schnauz 's belongings , written in the second person ... and apparently intended as an open letter to his father . It includes the names of his victims- - the women he desired to save . My name is contained in the last entry . I have no further explanation for the existence of the photographs , nor am I confident one is forthcoming . My captivity forced me to understand ... and even empathize with Gerry Schnauz . My survival depended on it . I see now the value of such insight . For truly to pursue monsters , we must understand them . We must venture into their minds . Only , in doing so , do we risk letting them venture into ours ? Subtitles by : syafiQ a.k.a basikalbaru [ Child ] I made this !

If you want to watch a particular TV programme , like / All My Children ... go to the nurse , tell her the day , the time the show you wanna see is on . But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on . This guy was always requesting shows that had already played . Yes . No . You have to tell her before . He couldn 't grasp the idea that the nurse couldn 't make it be yesterday . She couldn 't turn back time ! Thank you , Einstein . Now he , he was nuts . He was a fruitcake , Jim . Okay , that 's it , Jeffrey . You 're gonna get a shot . - I warned you . - Right . I got a little carried away ... explaining the inner workings of the institution to Jim .

Only about one percent of us survived . - Are you going to save us ? - How can I ? This already happened . I can 't save you . Nobody can . I am simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present ... trace the path of the virus . We 're not in the present now , Mr Cole ? 1990 is the past . This already happened . That 's what I 'm trying ... You believe 1996 is the present then , is that it ? No ! 1996 is the past too . Listen to me . What I ... What I ... What I need to do is make a telephone call . I can straighten this out if I make a telephone call . Who would you call ? Who would straighten everything out ? The scientists . They 'll want to know that they sent me to the wrong time . I can leave a voice mail message that they monitor from the present . Can I just make one telephone call , please ? Please ? What are you doin ' in the dog bowl ? Get outta there ! Who put those Doritos in there anyway ? Yes ? What ? Voice mail ? Look , I don 't know ... Stop makin ' that noise ! I don 't know what you 're talkin ' about . Is this a joke ?

Last week , in fact , right before I got dragged into this hellhole ! I go in to order a burger in this fast-food joint . The guy drops it on the floor . Jim , he picks it up , wipes it off . He hands it to me like it was all okay . " What about the germs ? " I say . He says , " I don 't believe in germs . Germs are a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soaps . " Now , he 's crazy , right ? See ? There 's no right . There 's no wrong . There 's only popular opinion . You , you , you believe in germs , right ? I 'm not crazy . Of course not ! You wanna escape , right ? That 's very sane . I can help you . You want me to , don 't ya ? Get you out ? You know how to get outta here ?

And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels ... seven golden vials full of the wrath of God ... who liveth forever and ever . " Revelations . In the 14th century , according to accounts of officials of that time ... this man appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle near Stonehenge ... in April of 1362 . Using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent ... the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence ... which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years . Obviously this plague-doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling ... when reality supports it with a virulent disease ... whether it 's the bubonic plague , small pox or AIDS . Now we have technological horrors as well ... such as chemical warfare , which first reared its ugly head ... during the deadly mustard gas attacks of World War I. During such an attack in the French trenches in October of 1917 ... we have an account of this soldier ... who , during an assault , was wounded by shrapnel ... and hospitalized , apparently in a state of hysteria . Doctors found he had lost all comprehension of French ... but that he spoke English fluently ... albeit in a regional dialect they didn 't recognize . The man , though physically unaffected by the gas ... was beside himself . He claimed that he had come from the future ... that he was looking for a pure germ ... that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the Earth ... starting in the year 1996 . Though injured , the young soldier disappeared from the hospital ... no doubt trying to carry on his mission to warn others ... and substituting for the agony of war ... a self-inflicted agony we call " the Cassandra complex . " Cassandra , in Greek legend , was condemned to know the future ... but to be disbelieved when she foretold it . Hence , the agony of foreknowledge , plus the impotence to do anything about it . I 'm going right out to get vaccinated . I think , Dr Railly , you 've given alarmists a bad name . I have ? There 's real data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race . - This is true . - Proliferation of atomic devices . Uncontrolled breeding habits . Pollution of land , sea and air . The rape of the environment . In this context , it 's obvious Chicken Little represents the sane vision ... and that / Homo sapiens ' motto , " Let 's go shopping " ... is the cry of the true lunatic . Please , Dr Railly .

I 'm doing what I 'm supposed to be doing . You see ? Here it is again . See ? Here , follow this paint trail . Here . It 's here , see ? I am not going ... Come with me ! The paint trail goes here . Let go of my arm ! James , we shouldn 't be here . Goddam it ! Leave me alone ! Let 's get out of here . James , we shouldn 't be here . Please don 't kill me . Don 't kill me , please ! Don 't kill me , don 't kill me ! Stick around , bitch . Are you all right ? Is he alive ? Go ahead . We 're runnin ' out of time . - You can 't help him . - Oh , Jesus ! James , you killed him ! All I see are dead people . Come on . - Come on . - You never had a gun before ! I have one now . Come on . Come on ! " Dragons in their pleasant palaces . The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ... and there came ... " You ! You 're one of us . This is it . Come on . Can we help you ? It 's just a tape . I 'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys . We don 't know anything about an Army of the Twelve Monkeys so just disappear . - Just want some information . - Didn 't you hear me ? Don 't hurt her ! Please , I 'm a psychiatrist . Just do whatever he tells you to do . He 's disturbed . He 's dangerous . - Please just cooperate . - You want money ? - We only got a few bucks . - I told you what I want . Get down . Lock that door . Lock it now ! - I told you that Goines would get us ... - Shut up ! - Goines ? - Jeffrey Goines ? Jeffrey becomes this big star , and the media latch onto him ... because he 's picketing his own father ... a famous Nobel-prize-winning virologist . You must have seen all that on TV . I don 't watch TV . Is this him ? Yeah , that 's him , that 's him . What are you gonna do to us ? Tell me more about Jeffrey . Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do ... picketing , leafleting , letter-writing stuff . He said we were ineffectual , liberal jerk-offs . He wanted to do guerrilla actions in order to educate the public . - Like this ? - He let 100 snakes loose in the Senate . But we weren 't into that kind of stuff . It 's counterproductive . We told him . So he and 11 guys , they split off ... and formed this underground army . The Army of the Twelve Monkeys . See ? They started planning a " human hunt . " They bought stun guns , nets and bear traps . They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers . They didn 't do it , of course . They didn 't do any of it . Like always , Mr Big Shot sold his friends out . What does that mean ? He goes on TV and gives this big news conference , tells the world ... he just realized his dad 's experiments are vital for humanity ... and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary ... that from now on , he , Jeffrey Goines , will personally supervise the labs ... to make sure all the little animals aren 't going to suffer . What is this ? People like that aren 't accessible . You can 't just barge in on them . - It 's not how the world works . - Be quiet and drive the car . - I know what I 'm doing . - No , you don 't . This car is stolen , and we are in big trouble . Big trouble . If you don 't turn yourself over to the police , they 're going to kill you . They 're going to shoot me , too , because I 'm an accessory to murder . - You 're all going to die . - Nobody is going to die . You 're not going to save the world , okay ? You 're delusional . You 've made all this up out of bits and pieces in your head . - No . - Yes ! Let me give you an example . You know Jeffrey Goines . You were both patients at County Hospital . Jeffrey Goines was a fruitcake . He told you that his father was a famous scientist who worked with viruses ... so you incorporated that information to this cockeyed fantasy . He didn 't say his father was a scientist . He said his father was God . This is insane . / Prominent psychiatrist and author / Dr Kathryn Railly has been abducted ... / by a dangerous mental patient , / James Cole . / Cole was under Railly 's care / six years ago ... / when he made / a dramatic escape ... - What is the matter with your leg ? - I got shot . Shot ? Who shot you ? I don 't know . It was some kind of war . Never mind . You wouldn 't believe me anyway . What are you doing ? - We don 't need gas . - I thought you didn 't know how to drive . I said I was too young to drive . I didn 't say I was stupid . This can 't go on . If you have a bullet in your leg , I have to take care of it . I 'm a doctor . I need some supplies . / Meanwhile , / in Fresno , California ... / where mining engineers / continue their attempt ... / to sink a shaft parallel to the one / in which Ricky is believed trapped ... / authorities say there is still a chance / the boy might be alive . You shouldn 't put your weight on it . You need stitches and antibiotics . Lucky for you , it 's near the surface . I love seeing the sun . Wait . Let me help you . You smell so good . You have to give yourself up . You know that ? What are you doing ? James ? - I 'm sorry . - What are you doing ? - Stop it ! What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . Let go of me ! - They find him ? - Who ? - That kid , the one in the pipe . - You believe that ? They 're lowering a monkey down there ... with an infrared camera strapped on him ... and a roast beef sandwich wrapped up in tin foil . - You 're makin ' it up . - I shit you not , man . - Life is really weird . - A monkey and a roast beef sandwich . Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner ... and this most stimulating and exciting company ... for itself , with no sense of purpose . But , alas , I am burdened . For with all this excess of public attention and cacophony of praise ... there comes great responsibility . I don 't have to tell you all that the dangers of science ... are a timeworn threat . From Prometheus stealing fire from the gods ... What friend ? I 'm not expecting anyone . But never before ... This is ridiculous . My father 's giving a major address . ... to fear the power ... we have at hand . Normally , if we caught a guy ... sneaking around with no ID , we 'd bust his ass . Excuse my French . This one says he knows you . Since you seem to have had a few unusual associates ... we certainly would not want to arrest one of your closest pals . Never seen him before in my life . Feel free to torture this man , or whatever it is you do . I 'm going back to listen to my father 's eloquent discourse on the perils of ... I 'm here about some monkeys . - Monkeys ? - Monkeys , yes . Twelve of them . Arnold . - You look like shit . - You know this man ? Of course I know this man . Arnold Pettibone . Gee , Arnie , it 's black tie . I said , " Drop by . " But it 's Dad 's big do ... VIPs , senators , secret service . You hungry , Arnie ? Real killer feast we 're putting on . Lots of dead lamb , dead cow , dead pig . Shall we ? Hi . How are you ? Hello . Very attractive . " The Great Escape , " 1990 . Watch it ! Huh ? County Hospital ? Am I right ? I can 't do anything about what you 're going to do . I can 't change anything . I won 't stop you . I can 't stop you . - I just want the information . - Come on . Hi , ladies . So nice to see you again . Watch your step on the way down . All right . Who blabbed ? Bruhns ? Weller ? I just want access to the pure virus . - Virus ? - I need to know where and what it is . I get it . I see what you 're up to . It 's your old plan , isn 't it ? - What plan ? - Your plan . - I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Yes , you do . We were in the day room watching television ... and you were upset about the desecration of the planet , which I understand . Then you said , " Wouldn 't it be great to have a germ or virus ... that would wipe out mankind and leave the animals and trees ? " - You 're trying to confuse me . - You were so funny . I told you my father was this famous virologist . You said , " He could make a germ , and we could steal it . " - You were so funny . - They mutate ! We live underground ! The world belongs to the dogs and cats . We live like worms . I just need the information ! - Take it easy . - You are a nutcase , completely deranged ! Delusional , paranoid . Your process is all fucked up . Your information tray is jammed , man . Do you know what it is , the Army of the Twelve Monkeys ? It 's a collection of space-case do-gooders saving rain forests . I have nothing to do with those bozos any more . I 've quit being the rich-kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffective fanatics ! So much for your grand plot , asshole ! My father has warned people about the dangers ... of experimenting with DNA viruses for years . You processed that information through your addled , paranoid infrastructure . Lo and behold , a non-profit organization ... becomes a sinister , revolutionary cabal ! This man is complete bat shit ! Ladies and gentlemen ... do you realize where he thinks he comes from ? / Captain Dan Miller , the man / in charge of the rescue operation ... / says he has consulted with experts ... / and they assure us / there will be no negative ... If you ask me , the monkey 's gonna eat that goddam sandwich himself . Did a man just come running through here ? / His primary responsibility / was to the missing boy . / Police say / that the body of a woman ... / found strangled / in Knutson State Park ... / could be kidnapping victim ... / Dr Kathryn Railly . Anybody see someone come through here ? / The body was discovered / less than an hour ago by hikers . / But we have an unconfirmed report / that the victim ... / a woman in her late 20s / or early 30s ... / was savagely mutilated . / Earlier in the day , police located / Railly 's abandoned car . / It was found not far from ... Any sign of him ? Nothing . He can 't just disappear . You bastard ! I could have died in there , you son of a bitch ! What are you thinking of ... you twisted sack of shit ? Sorry I locked you in the trunk . I 'm sick of you . What have you done ? Did you kill somebody ? Yes . - A million people , five billion people . - What ? Jeffrey Goines said that it was my idea about the virus . We were in the institution . It was all so fuzzy with the drugs . Do you think it was my idea ? Do you think maybe I wiped out the human race ? Nobody is gonna wipe out the human race . Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else . You 've created something in your mind . - Mentally divergent ? - Whatever . A substitute reality ... because you don 't want to deal with anything . I would love it if that was true . It can be dealt with , but only if you want to . I can help you . - They 're after me . - Who is after you ? We have to get out of here . There were policemen at that party . Party ? You went to a ... Never mind . It 's important you surrender instead of them catching you running away . Wouldn 't it be great if I was crazy ? Then the world would be okay . - Give me the gun . Where is the gun ? - I lost the gun . I could live right here . You got water , air , stars . - I 'm gonna attract their attention . - Debris . I 'm gonna attract their attention so they know where we are . I love this world ! They 're gonna tell you to put your hands on your head . Do what they say . I love the frogs , the spiders . I 'll be with you . I 'll help you . I won 't let them ... Then I said something about cooperating , and he said he would do that . So I got in the car . Thanks . And when I ... I started honking the horn , and when I got out , he was gone . I tell you something . You lucked out . For a while we thought you were a body found down state , mutilated . - He wouldn 't do that . - This the man he attacked ? I want to be clear about this , okay ? This man and the other one were severely beating us . James Cole didn 't start it . In fact , he saved me . Funny thing , Doctor . Maybe you can help explain it to me , you being a psychiatrist and all . Why do kidnap victims always tell us about the guys that grabbed ' em ... and they try to make us understand ... how kind these bastards really were . It 's a normal reaction to a life-threatening situation . He 's sick , okay ? He thinks he comes from the future . He lives in a meticulously constructed fantasy world that 's disintegrating . He needs help . / Exhausted but apparently unharmed / by her 30-hour ordeal ... / Dr Railly returned to Baltimore / without making a public statement . / The author and psychiatrist / is currently in seclusion at her home . / Meantime , police have pieced together / a scenario of the series of events ... / that began with escaped / mental patient James Cole ... - Sorry . - No , it 's okay . I 'm just hyper-alert . I can 't sleep . - Did you take a sedative ? - I hate those things . They mess me up . / With the kidnapping / of the Baltimore woman , James Cole ... / is now also wanted in connection ... / with the brutal slaying of Rodney / Wiggins , an ex-convict from Ardmore . / His body was discovered / in an abandoned theatre ... / not far from where Cole left 3 animal / rights activists bound and gagged ... / in their Second Avenue headquarters . Now , do they really believe that he 's going to show up here ? Please . / In Fresno , California , the corn field / that was jammed with spectators ... He 's dead , isn 't he ? That little boy . He 's fine . It was just a prank he and his friends pulled . / The dramatic attempts to rescue Ricky / Neuman from an abandoned mine shaft ... / ended abruptly / when playmates confessed ... / that Neuman 's disappearance / was a prank . / In fact , the missing child / was hiding in a nearby barn . / I found my thrill / On Blueberry Hill / On Blueberry Hill / When I found you Congratulations , Cole . Well done . Well done . During your interview , while you were under the influence ... you told us you liked music . - This isn 't a prison , James . - This is a hospital . - Until you recover your equilibrium . - You 're still a little disoriented . - Time travel is a very stressful thing . - You stood up very well , considering . You connected the Twelve Monkeys with a famous virologist and his son . - Others will take over now . - We 'll be back in service in months . We 'll retake the planet . This is what you 've been working for . - A full pardon . - You 'll be out of here in no time . - Women will want to get to know you . - I don 't want your women ! I want to get well ! And you will be well , James . Soon . You know , you people don 't exist . You 're not real . We can 't travel back in time . You 're not here . You can 't trick me . You 're in my mind . I am insane , and you are my insanity . He not only used the word " prank " ... he said the boy was hiding in a barn . Kathryn , Kathryn , he kidnapped you . You saw him murder somebody ... and you knew there was a real possibility ... he could kill you too . You 're under tremendous emotional stress . For God 's sake , Owen , listen to me . He knew about the boy in Fresno ... and he says five billion people are gonna die . No way he could possibly know that . You 're a rational person . You 're a trained psychiatrist . You know the difference between what 's real and what 's not . What we say is the truth is what everybody accepts , right ? Psychiatry is the latest religion . We decide what 's right and wrong . We decide who 's crazy or not . I 'm in trouble here . I 'm losing my faith . / You sure fucked up , Bob . / But I can understand . / You don 't want your mistakes / pointed out to you . / I can relate to that , old Bob . / I know what you 're thinkin ' . / You 're thinkin 'I don 't exist / except in your head . / I can see that point of view . / But you could still talk to me , / couldn 't ya ? I saw you ... in 1996 , in the real world . - You pulled out your teeth . / - Why would I pull out my teeth , Bob ? / That 's a no-no . / And when did you say you saw me ? / - In 1872 ? - Leave me alone ! / Yellin ' won 't get you / what you want . / You have to be smart / to get what you want . - What do I want ? / - You don 't know what you want ? / Sure you do , Bob . / You know what you want . You tell me . Tell me what I want . / To see the sky and the ocean ... / to be topside ... / breathe the air ... / to be with her . / Isn 't that right ? / Isn 't that what you want ? / Bob ? Jim Halperin , Philly PD . Sorry to call you so early . You found him ? Is he okay ? No , no . Au contraire , Doctor . No sign of your good friend , the kidnapper . However , the plot does thicken . I got a ballistics report here on my desk . It says the bullet you claim you removed from Cole 's thigh ... is , in fact , an antique . / And all indications are ... / it was fired sometime / prior to the 1920s . - / How about I take a spin down there ? - This can 't be . / You and I can grab a bite to eat ... and maybe you could revise or amplify your statement . / You can 't trick us , you know . / It wouldn 't work . No , sir . / You haven 't become addicted , / have you ... / to that dying world ? No , sir . I just want to do my part to get us back on top ... in charge of the planet . And I have the experience . I know the people involved . He really is the most qualified . But all that behaviour . You said we weren 't real . I don 't think the human mind is meant to exist ... in two different ... whatever you called it , dimensions ? It 's just too stressful . You said that yourself . It 's very confusing . You don 't know what 's real and what 's not . / But you know what 's real now . Yes , sir , I do . No , I don 't know anything about ... a monkey army , Doctor . No , nothing whatsoever . Good Lord , if my son was ever involved in something like that ... Yeah ? Well , I 'm sorry . I think it 's doubly inappropriate to discuss ... security matters with you , Dr Railly . But if it will ease your mind ... rest assured that neither my son ... nor any other unauthorized person ... has access to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory . Is that clear to you now ? Thank you so much for your concern . Women psychiatrists ! I attended a lecture of hers once . " Apocalyptic Visions . " She was suddenly struck ... by the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey . Has she succumbed to her own ... " theoretical " Cassandra disease ? Maybe we ought to review our security procedures . Perhaps upgrade ' em , you know ? Beef 'em up . Let 's consider again our current information . If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia ... on December 2 7 , 1996 , that makes us know that ... It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13 , 1996 . And was seen sequentially after that in ... San Francisco , New Orleans ... Rio de Janeiro ... Rome , Kinshasa ... Karachi , Bangkok , then Peking . That was very well done . If you 're in there , I have to talk to you ! It 's the kidnap woman . The one who was with the guy who tied us up . Turn off the lights . Turn off the light ! - What 's she doin ' ? - She 's drawing attention to us . I don 't know what you 're up to , but you 're gonna get us in deep shit . Walkies ready , batteries charged ? I saw you ! I saw somebody in there ! Secret experiments . That 's what they do . Secret , weird stuff . - Not just on animals . - I know you . - Do ' em on people too down at ... - Have you seen James Cole ? They 're watching you . - Takin ' pictures . - The police . I know . Look . I have to contact James . It 's very , very important that he 's really careful when he reaches me . Do you understand that ? - Good . - Who 's James ? He was with me . He spoke to you several weeks ago . He said that you were from the future and that you were watching him . Bolt cutters . Did you get the bolt cutters ? One dozen . They 're in the van . - The plans for the security system ? - All right here , committed to memory . - You know what she 's doin ' out there ? - What 's it say ? I can 't see it . Forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand . Your psychiatrist ? - Did you just say your psychiatrist ? - Ex-psychiatrist . This woman was your psychiatrist ... and now she 's spray-painting our building ? What 's it say ? - What ? - There 's a policeman over there . - Pretend you don 't know me . - I want to turn myself in . - Where is he ? - James ! Down ! No , it 's okay . I 'm not crazy any more . I mean , I am . I 'm mentally divergent . I know that now . I want you to help me . I want to get better . Let 's get outta here . He 's going . Go ! - I 've seen that before . - No , you haven 't . A guy in a Ford is chasing her and some other guy I can 't see . No problem . It 's probably just another kidnapping ... featuring Jeffrey 's shrink . Pardon me . Make that ex-shrink . This is your leader ? A certifiable lunatic ... who told his former psychiatrist all his plans ... for God knows what wacko irresponsible schemes ? God knows what she 's written on that wall ! Who cares what psychiatrists write on walls ? You think I told her about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys ? Impossible ! Do you know why ? Do you know why ? Because , you pathetically ineffectual ... and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals , I 'll tell you why . Because when I had anything to do with her six years ago ... there was no such thing , I hadn 't thought of it yet . Then how come she knows what 's going on ? Well , here 's my theory on that . When I was institutionalized , my brain was studied exhaustively ... in the guise of mental health . I was interrogated , x-rayed . I was examined thoroughly . Then they took everything about me and put it into a computer ... where they created this model of my mind . Yes ! Using that model ... they managed to generate every thought ... I could possibly have in the next ten years ... which they then filtered through a probability matrix of some kind ... to determine everything I was gonna do in that period . So , you see ... she knew I was gonna lead the Army of the Twelve Monkeys ... into the pages of history before it even occurred to me . She knows everything I 'm ever gonna do before I know it myself . How 's that ? Kweskin , you finish here . I 'll meet you there . And if you forget one thing , I 'll have you shaved , sterilized and destroyed . - Jeff ? - What ? You 're a great man . Fuck the bozos ! He 's seriously crazy . You know that . There . Over there . Okay . Come on . - I need a room . - Thirty-five bucks an hour . - An hour ? - You want quarter hours ? Go someplace else . Here 's ... twenty-five , six , seven for an hour . Deal ? One hour , honey babe . Number 64 . Sixth floor . Up the stairs , end of the hall . Elevator 's busted . She 's not " honey babe . " She 's a doctor . My psychiatrist . Understand ? Whatever gets it up for you , Jack . Tommy , this is Charlie over at the Globe . You know if Wallace has a new girl ? Sort of a rookie type ? A little weird ? Does fantasy acts ? Okay , you were standing there looking up at the moon . You were splashing through the water , and then what ? I thought I was in prison again . Just like that , you were in prison ? No , not really . Like you said , it was all in my mind . You disappeared . One minute you were there , the next minute you were gone . Did you run through the woods , or ... I don 't know . I don 't remember . The boy in the well . How did you know that was just a hoax ? It was ? I didn 't know . You said he was hiding in a barn ! I think I maybe saw a TV show about that ... when I was a kid where a boy ... It wasn 't a TV show ! It was real ! Maybe this boy saw the same TV show that I did ... and he copied it . Look , you were right . I am mentally ill . I imagined all these things , these people . I know they 're not real . I can trick them . I can make them do what I want . I worked on ' em a little bit . I got back here to get better . - I can stay here . - What does this mean to you ? I think I had a dream about this . You had a bullet from World War I in your leg . How did it get there ? I don 't know . You said I had delusions , that I created this world . - You said you could explain . - I can 't ! I 'm trying to , and ... I can 't believe that everything we say or do has already happened . We can 't change what 's gonna happen . And if five billion people are gonna die , it 's ... I want the future to be unknown . I want to become a whole person again . I want this to be the present . I want to stay here this time ... with you . Do you remember six years ago you had a phone number ? - It was the wrong number then . - A woman answered . It was the wrong number in 1990 . It should be the right number now . Do you remember it ? The number . This is my territory , bitch ! - Is this real or one of my delusions ? - This is definitely real . Excuse me . I think we 've got a little misunderstanding here . - Yeah . We ... - Gee , really ? Now , you just sit tight , chief . You listen to me , little Miss Understanding . You think you can go around me and peddle your ass in this part of town ? You bet your life we got what I would call ... a major fuckin ' misunderstanding . James , no ! Don 't ! Put him in the closet . Take his money first ! - You want me to rob him ? - We need cash ! Call the cops ! Call the cops ! What 's goin ' on ? I 've got friends , man . Don 't fuckin ' kill me . No , James ! Open the door ! What the fuck are you doing ? Please don 't hurt him . Open the door . James , come on . Just in case ... Just in case I 'm not crazy , this is how they find us . By our teeth . I don 't want them to find me ever . I don 't want to go back . Step back . You 'd better load . Police ! Throw your weapons out and come on out ! Hey ! Is that the cops ? I 'm the innocent victim here . I was attacked by a coked-up whore ... and a fuckin ' crazy dentist . Try to blend in . Oh , Jesus ! Come on . There 's gotta be a phone around here somewhere . Over there . Look . I 'm gonna try that number , okay ? Let 's hope it 's nothing . It 's okay ! We 're insane . We 're crazy . It 's a carpet cleaning company . - A carpet cleaning company ? - Yeah . No superiors . No scientists . No men from the future . It 's just a carpet cleaning company . They have voice mail . You leave a message telling where you want your carpet cleaned . - You left them a message ? - Yeah , I couldn 't resist . Wait till they hear this nutty woman telling them to watch out ... for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys . I said , " The Freedom for Animals Association on Second Avenue ... " " Is the secret headquarters of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys . They 're the ones who are gonna do it . I can 't do anything more now . I have to go . Have a merry Christmas . " You couldn 't have heard me . They got your message . They played it for me . It was a bad recording , distorted . I didn 't recognize your voice . This . And this . And this . Is everything okay ? You want anything ? Shall I put this on your account , ma 'am ? No . That 'll be cash . Can you tell me what floor the wigs are on ? You turned the thing into a fucking computer . - And Fale believed it . - You know Fale . He 's like , " If you guys get nailed , which I 'm pretty sure you will ... I 've never seen you before in my fuckin ' life . " Come on , come on . Bring him through . Drive ! What 's the harm in opening ' up the bag ? His eyes are taped , right ? Right ? Hello . Hello . Wanna hear the monkey speak ? Jeffrey ? Jeffrey , I know that 's you . - I recognize your voice . - No , you don 't . I also know all about your warped little plan . That lady , your psychiatrist ? She told me . I didn 't believe her . It just seemed too crazy , even for you . But just in case , I took steps ... to make sure that you couldn 't go through with it . I don 't have the code any more . I don 't have access to the virus . I took myself out of the loop . Too late ! Too late ! We 've got plans for you , Dad . I never let myself believe it . Now I know it 's true . Jeffrey ? You 're completely insane . No , I 'm not . / There 's a cross section of one of / the old trees that 's been cut down . / Here I was born . / And there I died . / It was only a moment for you . / You took no notice . I think I 've seen this movie before . - When I was a kid , I saw it on TV . - Don 't talk . - I did see it before . - / Tall trees . / Have you been here before ? / - Yes . / - When ? - But I don 't recognize this ... - / When were you born ? - / Long ago . - / Where ? What 's the matter ? / Tell me . / Madeleine , tell me . It 's just like what 's happening with us . Like the past . The movie never changes . It can 't change . But every time you see it , it seems different because you 're different . You see different things . / Please don 't ask me . If you can 't change anything because it 's already happened ... you may as well smell the flowers . What flowers ? It 's an expression . Why are you doing this ? I want to know why . What if I 'm wrong ? What if you 're wrong ? What if I am crazy ? In a few weeks , it will have started or it won 't . If there 's still ... football games , traffic jams ... TV shows and armed robberies ... we 're going to be so glad ... that we 'll be thrilled to see the police . / I 'm responsible for you now . / The Chinese say / once you 've saved a person 's life ... / you 're responsible for it forever , / so I 'm committed . Do you have a plan ? / I have to know . / There 's so little that I know . You said you 'd never seen the ocean . Hurry up . Come on . Jeffrey ? You know I can 't see . Where are we ? Jeffrey ? Please . We have 9 : 30 reservations for Key West . I just didn 't recognize you . Well , you look pretty different yourself . It was always you . In my dream . It was always you . I remember you like this . You do ? I felt I 've known you before . I feel like I 've always known you . I 'm so scared . What time 's your flight , friends ? - 9 : 30 . - Might be tight . Tight ? No . My watch says 7 : 30 . On your normal morning ' , okay . Plenty of time . But today you gotta take into account your Army of the Twelve Monkeys factor . What ? What 'd you say ? Twelve Monkeys . In case you folks didn 't turn on your radio this mornin ' . Bunch of weirdos let all the animals out of the zoo . Then they locked up this big-shot scientist in one of the cages . Scientist 's own kid one of the ones did it . They 've got animals all over the place . Bunch of zebras closed down the thruway about an hour ago . And they got some thing called an emu . It 's got traffic blocked for miles on 676 . / What do they think they 're accomplishing / by releasing an animal like this ... / into a city like this one ? That 's what they were up to ... freeing animals . On the walls . It said , " We did it . " They meant the animals . I think it 's gonna be all right . Tell your people if they spot either one of them not to try and apprehend them . They should notify us . We have people all over the airport .

The phone call I just made ? - Five minutes ago . - Yeah , five minutes ago . Thirty years ago . They just put it together . " Uh , hey , this is Cole , James . I don 't know whether you 're there or not . Maybe you just clean carpets . " Where 'd you get that from ? " Forget about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys .

 Oh , come on . It 's not even 6 : 00 o 'clock . This better be good . " Fire at historic Blackstone Hotel . " This can 't be . It 's my hotel here . " A room on the top floor of the hotel was severely damaged when faulty wiring caused ... " What if you knew , beyond a doubt , what was going to happen tomorrow ? What would you do ? There 's no easy answer for a guy who gets tomorrow 's news today . * * Did you see those flames ? It was just like a movie . Man , look at those fire trucks . Yeah . I wish my house would burn down . You 're a fortunate man , Mr. Hobson . Caught it just in time . Except for your room , of course . Yeah . Lucky me . Getting another room ? I don 't know . I - I ... I guess I 'm due for a change . Everything I had was burned . Well , uh ... thanks , Boswell . Uh , I 'm gonna miss you , you know . Me , too . Hey . Hey ! Hey ! Oh . Sorry . I ... I 'm looking for a cat that 's down here , that I , um ... Thank you . Hey ! Come here ! You think this is funny ? 'Cause I don 't think this is funny ! I 'll tell you something . I 'm not gonna chase you anymore , you hear me ? I ... Oh . Is that regular or decaf ? Your guess is as good as mine . Sugar ? No , it 's Charles . That 's humor , right ? It 's supposed to be . Oh . You know , Chuck , if you 're not careful , one of these days , you 're gonna have to find some new dialogue . You 're just jealous . Chuck . Marissa . Hey , Gary . Hey , Gare . How you doing ? You going on a trip ? Sort of . Suddenly , I am homeless . Oh . How 's that ? My hotel room burned ... down ... with everything in it . Are you all right ? Where am I gonna sleep tonight ? Well , you can always stay at your friend Chuck 's . He 's got an extra bed . How do you know that ? He keeps telling me about it . Oh . Uh , looks like your cat 's trying to find you a place right now . Fine . Go-Go ahead . Why don 't you stay here , huh ? Probably set the damn thing . Well , it 's okay with me . I 'd love the company . I don 't think anybody 's gonna be staying here . They 're tearing us down . Tearing who down ? Us . Here . McGinty 's . He 's turning it into a parking lot . Well , he being who ? Barney Kadison . Ladies and gentlemen , members of the press , my own small contribution to the tax base of this fair city . Kadison Parking . Precision technology for the new urban century . Any questions ? Here . Uh , Mr. Kadison ? Max . Mr. Kadison , uh , this new project will be covering an entire square block of downtown real estate . How did you manage to acquire so much property ? Patience , persistence , unpaid mortgages , and faith in the almighty dollar . That 's rather cynical , wouldn 't you say ? These days , it 's good business . Next ? Here ! Mr. Kadison , are you aware that some of these buildings you 'll be knocking down are places where people live ? In fact , one of those places has ... Please , let 's not tackle that now . But the people should know that ... Ladies and gentlemen , thank you for coming . There are refreshments in the other room . Have a good afternoon . This way , folks . Who is that woman ? She runs the foster home you 're tearing down . Too bad . But we got enough foster homes in this city . Why don 't you send her some flowers . Why would McGinty want to sell this place ? He 's owned it forever . It 's practically a landmark . It has to be some kind of mistake . Where is McGinty , anyway ? I haven 't seen him in a couple of days . I know he likes to play chess in the park . That 's it . Let 's go find him . Huh ? We 've got to talk McGinty out of this . This is Chicago . You can 't go tearing down a bar . That 's like chopping down a redwood . Marissa , let 's go . Oh , I 'm sorry , I wish I could , but I can 't . I 've got a human biology exam in an hour . Come on , Spike . Break a femur . Oh , thanks . Well , I guess that leaves you and me . Uh , I can 't . Listen , hey , Mona , take care of my cat for me . Would you ? And grab that bag . Love to . Hey ! What 's more important than this ? This . " Two local childrenwere killed today when they stepped " in front of a bus as it pulled out from the curb . " The names of the children were not immediately released . The accident occurred at Webster and Southport just after 10 : 00 . " All right , fine . You go take care of the kids . I 'll take care of the important stuff . " The important stuff " ? What important stuff ? What 's more important than this ? Finding McGinty . Annie ? Don 't worry . I 'll remember . Can I bring Skatey-Eight ? Go . Where is she ? She 'll be here in a second . And that 's a table for two ? Great . Your table will be ready shortly . Thank you . Excuse me . I 'm lost . I beg your pardon ? I can 't find my mommy . Can you help me ? Well , what does she look like ? She 's a grown-up lady . That 's not enough to tell me what she ... I can 't find my mommy ! I can 't find my mommy ! All right , all right , all right , all right . Where did you see her last ? Okay . You ready ? And then she never came back . I 've been waiting and waiting . Go . Uh-huh . Now , now , it 'll be okay . We 'll find your mom . A big , yellow one . Hey . Hey ! Hey , you kids ! Hey ! Hey , you kids ! Come back with that money ! Hey ! I think I see Mommy now . Hey ! You little criminals ! Come back here ! The little criminals ! Move it ! I 'm moving ! I 'm moving ! Go ! Cross here ! Hey , stop ! You 're going to get hurt ! By what ? By that . How 'd you know ? Because I 'm smart . That 's how I ... Hey , guys ! Wait up ! Hey , look out ! No ! You all right ? Who are you ? My name 's Gary . He 's a cop . I 'm - a what ? Ow ! Come on ! He 's got Skatey-Eight ! Hey ! There he is again . That 's him . What 's he want ? He wants to throw us in the slammer , that 's what . But we 're not going to let him , right ? Right . Hey , Mister ! You can 't go in there . Come around the back . Hey , wait . Hey , I got ... Hey ! Follow me ! Hey , excuse me . I think I 've got ... Stop . Don 't move . I said stop ! Look , I 've just got your ... Oh ! Oh , no ! It works ! Ooh ... It worked ! We did it ! Hey , kid ? Here 's your teddy bear . Yay ! Cool ! I can 't believe it ! Yeah ! You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Nothing broken ? No , no , no . I think I 'm fine . See , Miss Jean ? It 's safe . We could use that on anyone . Oh , that 's a comfort to know . Oh , I see . I guess I 'm the , uh , the guinea pig , so to speak , huh ? Nah . Just a test subject . Besides , we thought you were a cop . In any event , let me welcome you to Frawley House and apologize for the nature of your greeting , Mr ... Oh , oh - Hobson . Gary Hobson . Jean Frawley . Dr. Frawley . And these are ... well , my family , all of them . It 's quite a brood you got here . And this is Skatey-Eight . Hi , Skatey-Eight . Nice to meet you . Why do you call her Skatey-Eight ? Just what it is . We 're from all over the place . So , I guess now that you 've met us , uh , you 'll be going , right ? Will . Well , unless he 's got something to say ... You don 't , do you ? No , I don 't . He didn 't tell about us stealing the money or getting hit by the truck . Oh , man . I beg your pardon ? Well , it , uh ... Rook to king five , bishop takes queen . Checkmate . McGinty ? Hey . McGinty ... McGinty ? It 's me - Chuck Fishman . From the bar , remember ? What bar ? From your bar McGinty 's . Oh . Well , I 'll be damned . What can I do for you ? Look , what the heck happened to it ? Well , it , uh ... Someone sold it right out from under me . That 's terrible . Who would do a thing like that ? Me . Well , I mean , it wasn 't really that bad . They were just running around like kids 'll do . Yeah , they 've got spirit . Especially the , the three of ' em , eh ? They 've come a long way since they first got here . They 've bonded together like brothers and sisters . They 're really good for each other . Can I ask you something ? Is it an orphanage or ... ? Well , it 's really a foster home , all made possible by the couple who donated the house . They provided for everything ... almost . Unfortunately they ran into something they weren 't prepared for . Well , what was that ? Barney Kadison . Not you , too ? The parking lot king . I have tried everything to stop him , Mr. Hobson - letters , recommendations , even adverse publicity . I 've even taken him to court trying to get an injunction , but lawyers cost money and there 's not much time . Well , if there 's anything I can do to ... Yeah , rob a bank . I don 't think I 'd be very good at that one . I 'm sorry , I don 't mean to make my problems yours . We 'll work things out . Thanks again for bringing back Annie 's bear . You 're welcome . Good luck with everything . Oh , do I have to ? Yeah , you do . Somebody elected you my mother ? There weren 't a lot of applications for the job . Drink the coffee , McGinty . I haven 't been drunk since I got this bar 38 years ago . I hate to break it to you , but you don 't own this bar anymore . I know . So , why did you sell it ? Well , my doctor says I 've got to retire to some place like Arizona . My asthma . So , I find a condo in Flagstaff , but I need the cash to pay for it . Fifty grand . Then this guy , Kadison calls . Takes me out to dinner . Nice guy , great talker . We had a few drinks . Maybe more than a few . And he offered to buy me out . It seemed reasonable at the time . Did he tell you what he was gonna do with the place ? He said he wanted to improve it . Yeah , right down to the ground . Before I realized the truth ... it was gone . Yeah , and that makes two of us . Oh , you 're not the only ones . There 's a bunch of kids on the other side of the block in a foster home . They don 't have anywhere to go either . Great , we 'll join forces . Yeah , we 'll call ourselves the " Association of Orphans and Bartenders . " Not to mention cats . Excuse me . Where you going now ? Look , pal , whatever he paid you for this place , it wasn 't enough . I know . How much did he pay you for it anyway ? You 're gonna be mad at me . Hey ? Psst ... hey ! I didn 't know this was here . Hey , come on , let 's go . Psst ! Hey , I 'm not kidding , let 's go . Hey . Hey , cat . Psst ! Hey ! Hey ... Hey ! Come on , what 's wrong with you ? Huh ? You wanna move in here ? Place is too big , let 's go . For valuable considerations , seller shall assign all blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . So , what do you think ? Absolutely bogus . Hey , what is ? This contract McGinty signed . It 's horribly , horribly undervalued . Kadison took my client out , got him drunk and then practically stole the place out from under his nose . He did ? Your client ? That 's right , my client . Just consider me your own personal Johnny Cochran . Well , I really appreciate that . Who 's Johnny Cochran ? Hey , hey , I am a businessman , okay ? I want the cash in my office today or we don 't break ground . I call in your note , Senator , it 's gonna be very embarrassing , right . What a wimp . What made you think he 'd be here ? Pure street smarts . Plus , I called his office . Come on . Are you sure about this ? Never surer . What 's this place anyway ? It 's a health club . Mr. Kadison ? Who are you ? That depends on what you say next . Okay ... Scram . I 'll ignore that for now . But it may cost you , once we start the negotiations . What negotiations ? My client here has a contract . You cheated him . He owns a little bar not far from here . A gem : worth its weight in gold . And your contract with him is fraudulent . You want a new contract ? Exactly . Okay , fine . Rip it up and I 'll write you a new one . Oh . That 's more like it . For how much ? Ten cents . What ? Then I 'll call City Hall , have the Fire Marshall pay you a visit , Board of Health , in 24 hours the place will be worth absolutely zip . Take it or leave it . A dime ? ! A dime ... Pleasure doing business with you , gents . So , are we through negotiating ? Well , we 'll get back to you on that . Kadison ... We 'll get right b - back to you on it . Hey ! Hey ! Hey , somebody ! Security ! Here 's one . At least they don 't take cats . Why don 't you go do something useful like take a nap or chase a rat or something , huh ? Hey . Do you really think we can pull it off ? No problem . Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? Of course I know what I 'm doing . I 'm writing a note . Read it . " This is a hold-up . We have a bomb . " It 's not gonna work . Do we look like bank robbers ? Fine . Okay . " We are children of very desperate men " who will do ... " anything ... For cash . " For cash . " But it 's not true . Neither is the part about the bomb . It 's not ? " Put the money in the pillowcase . " You got the pillowcase ? Hold it . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Oh , man ... What do you think you 're doing ? You know these kids ? Do I ... Uh , well , uh , yeah . W - Well , uh , th-they 're friends of mine . What 's with you ? Some kind of radar ? Now , what 's with this pillowcase ? Th-Th-The pillow , that would be - They 're practicing for Halloween , aren 't you ? Practicing for Halloween ? Yeah , Halloween . Yeah . No , we 're not . We 're robbing the bank . A bank ? We were only gonna take what we need . Oh , oh , I see . A bomb ? It wasn 't real . It wasn 't - It doesn 't matter if it 's real . You 're not supposed to rob banks ! It 's against the law ! Don 't you know that ? So ? We got our reasons . Oh , you got your reasons , tough guy , huh ? All right , and what are those ? None of your business . You know , I got an idea . Why don 't I take you home and you can all explain this to Miss Frawley ? Shows what you know . She 's not there . She 's at some other bank trying to get a loan . And they 'll turn her down , just like the others . Which is why we need the money . What money ? To pay the lawyers . To keep us together . She thinks we don 't know , but we do . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Know what ? They 're gonna split us up . Who told you that ? We can read her mail . We lose that house and the city sends us away . And we 're not gonna let that happen . But the question is : Are you gonna help us or not ? Me ? You got some kind of special power , right ? X - ray vision or something ? Okay , you don 't want to talk about it . But you could use it to save our place . What do you say ? I - I 'll do what I can . I 'll talk to Kadison . But that 's it , no promises . You understand ? No promises . Now , go home . Go to your rooms . And don 't open up any more mail . That 's a federal offense , you know ? Think he can do it ? Of course he can do it . Guy 's like Superman . He 'll get it done . Why me ? That 's right , sir . The money arrived a few minutes ago . Mr. Kadison sends his warmest regards . Oh , may I help you ? Yes , ma 'am . I 'd like to speak with Mr. Kadison , please . Oh , do you have an appointment ? No , I don 't have an appointment , but this is very important . Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . Mr. Kadison never sees anyone without an appointment . Oh , I see , well , when can I get an appointment ? February . Have a nice day . Excuse me , uh , Mr. Kadison ? My name 's Gary Hobson . Have I called the police yet ? What ? You heard me . Have I called for the cops ? No , I-I don 't think so . Oh , this must be your lucky day . You see , you still have a chance to walk out that door and avoid serious unhappiness . Mr. Kadison ... Whoops . You just missed your chance , didn 't you ? Mr. Kadison , please ... Hey , you 're taking a big chance here . What is it ? Widgets ? Gold mines in Africa ? What do you want ? No - kids . Fifteen kids . You 're tearing down their home to build a parking lot . And what do you want me to do about this terrible thing ? Well , I was , I was ... Scrap the project ? Build around them ? Better yet , why not fund an entirely new home , say , for a hundred kids ? Well , yeah , that would be - And who pays me for that ? Mr. Kadison , I don 't know who pays you for it - Money , Hobson , come on . Parking lots make it . Foster homes , last I checked , do not . Money : It 's what builds this and much of that . Or hadn 't you noticed ? Oh , yeah , I 've noticed . Well , good , then we understand , don 't we ? Yeah , but , Mr. Kadison , I 'm not talking about money . I 'm talking about people . I 'm talking - Sorry . I am not interested in people . Those your kids , Mr. Kadison ? You know , I gotta tell you something , Mr. Kadison . I don 't understand people like you . What are you , hollow inside ? You don 't have any feelings ? End of meeting . Mike ! Phil ! Yeah , let me tell you something . You know , you people , you live in your tall buildings , you look down on everyone ... Let 's go , buddy ! I 'm not finished . You know , you live in your tall ... Hey , Mr. Kadison , have a good day , Mr. Kadison . Angela ? That young man shows up again , call the cops . Hello ? Hello ? Oh , no . Surprise ! What did he say ? ! Well ? Did you see Mr. Kadison ? Did he change his mind ? Did he say we could stay ? Please , tell us ! Yeah , what did Mr. Kadison have to say ? Uh , well , uh ... Same as the courts . You said you 'd fix it . What does he mean ? He means we gotta leave . But this is our home . Who told you that ? Miss Jean . She promised . She said we could stay here . Yeah , well , now you learned . Promises don 't mean nothing . Just a bunch of words . You said we could stay here . You said that . Tell me you didn 't lie . Annie ... Then I hate you ! Like I said . Don 't mean nothing . Come on , Annie . Don 't be crying like this . So , we gotta move . That 's fine , we can handle it . So long as we 're together . But we 're not gonna be , Laverne . They 're gonna split us up . Fine then . We 'll do it ourselves . Talk to the man in person . Maybe ... Get off it , Laverne . We 'd never get in the door . Yeah , but ... Look ! Stop filling her head with junk , okay ? ! It 's over ! Just forget it ! Okay , so how come you are never without a paper ? I like to stay current . Right now , I 'm looking for an apartment . Oh , every time I look for a new place in the classifieds , I 'm always too late . Well , I like to stay ahead . How does that work ? It can 't be . It doesn 't . Let me tell you , it doesn 't work . Excuse me . Angela , hello ? Angela , where is she ? Actually , Mr. Kadison , uh , we sent her home . Why ? We got things to do here . I gotta get that cash to - It 's okay . It 's all been taken care of . What are you doing ? Collecting our bonuses , Mr. Kadison . Robbing the rich to pay the poor , Mr. Kadison . Don 't worry , Skatey-Eight , nothing bad 's gonna happen . We 're just going for a little visit . Jean ? Is Annie here ? Well , she should be . Laverne , have you seen Annie ? Last time I saw her , she was up in her room . She 's not now . I was just up there . Listen , I think Annie may be in some sort of trouble . Can I use your car ? Hold on , Mr. Hobson . I 'll drive . Hey , wait for us ! Get back in the house ! We 're coming , too ! No ! She 's part of our family . I know that , but you 're staying here . And , Will , I 'm putting you in charge until we get back with Annie . And that 's an order . Okay ? Okay . Everybody in the house ! Move it ! Move it ! Come on ! Why would she do something like this ? You don 't know Annie . She 's had enough bad luck to last a lifetime . Her parents died in a plane crash . Thanks , we 'll leave you the box . Gotta say , Phil , I 'm surprised . Never figured you for something like this . Why is that , Mr. Kadison ? I don 't know - loyalty , maybe . That 's pretty funny coming from you . Okay , just take it all and get out of here . Sure , except you 're coming with us . I mean , we can 't have you talking about this , can we ? I 'm sorry , Mr. Kadison , your party 's over . Who 's paying you to do this ? Nobody . We 're self-employed . Yeah , but I thought we were - What ? Friends ? You don 't have any of those . I did once . Yeah ? Well , none of them 's gonna help you now . Even if they wanted to . Which they don 't . Check that out . Hide , Skatey-Eight . Well , well . Let me go ! Let me go ! I 'm with the police ! Right and I 'm with the ballet . Come on . Says she had an appointment . I 've never seen her before in my life . Then how come you 're tearing down my house ? Another devoted fan , huh ? Did you come in here with anybody , kid ? Just me and Skatey-Eight . Call Security ! Have them meet me up there ! That 's all of it . Okay , on your feet . We 're outta here . Come on . What about her ? Her , too . Come on . She 's just a baby . I am not ! Whatever , kid . You 're in the wrong place at the wrong time . Now , both of you , on your feet . I 'm not going , Phil . Not unless you leave the kid here . Hey , I could take care of myself . What 's this ? Barney Kadison going soft ? Aren 't you the guy that said this city has enough foster homes ? You said that ? How could you say that ? Look , I was - How could you say that ? ! Leave her , Phil . I won 't give you any trouble . Not a chance . All right , come on , kid . No ! He 's mine ! Come on . Get the gun ! I got that . I wouldn 't do that . What 's going on here , Mr. Kadison ? Hank , these two guys just tried to rob me . Okay , Mr. Kadison , we 'll take them downstairs and notify the police . They 'll want your statement . Oh , I will be very eloquent . Annie . Oh , I was so worried about you . Well , I suppose you expect me to thank the three of you ? A little bit more than that . You can 't be serious . I 'm not changing my mind . And I am not bailing out on the parking lot . But what about these children ? Where will they go ? That is not my problem . I mean , what am I supposed to do - just junk the whole parking lot deal ? I mean , what am I ? Some kind of a jerk ? You 're a world-class jerk . But then again , I know that you weren 't always like that . Yeah ? What do you know ? Well , I know that , once upon a time , you , uh ... Well , you were one of the good guys . You used to be involved in charities and environmental issues , Yeah . That 's when I was a jerk . That was about eight years ago . That was , uh , that was about the time you decided to , uh , drop off from the human race , that was about the time that you decided to stop being a , uh , a decent citizen . Why is that ? What happened , Mr. Know-It-All , is that the world showed me that being one of the good guys didn 't mean a damn thing . That 's what happened . The plane crash . I did a little research . Next month , it 'll be eight years . I was to fly with my wife and two daughters to New York for vacation , and at the last minute , something came up , and I had to tell them that , uh , I would meet them there the next day . There was a big board meeting , you know , for a stupid charity . The phone rang and I , uh , I picked it up . And like that - just like that - my whole life meant absolutely nothing . Flight 88 had gone down . My wife and daughters were gone . People tried to help , but , you see , there wasn 't any help . All there was was pain . So , I found a way to get past it . Instead of doing good , I - I-I did business . I did lots of business . No people to worry about . Just stone , concrete , parking lots . No . No what ? You said that your whole life meant nothing . Right . But you had a family and you loved them . They must have loved you , too . Miss Jean says people shouldn 't feel sorry for themselves . You 're not doing them any good by being sad and mean . Besides , you didn 't die . They did . Look , kid , if you don 't mind ... I do mind . You weren 't there , okay ? Yes , she was . Her mother and father were both on that plane . Go ahead . Daddy died . But Mommy stayed alive for three days . Before she died , she ... she had me . This is what my daddy gave me . The day before the plane left . He 's called Skatey-Eight . Flight eighty-eight . He always helps me . If you want , you can borrow him for a while . Okay . You want to keep this rat trap ? You mean it ? Yeah , I 'll probably regret this in the morning , but yeah , I mean it . We 're staying ! Yay ! Yeah ! All right ! In other words , you 're looking for me to pay McGinty here , 150 thousand more ? The difference between what I paid him and the fair market value ? Well , yeah . I mean , but if that 's too much ... You got it . Well ... Good-bye , Chicago ! Hello , Flagstaff ! Mona , wanna go to Flagstaff ? Yeah , with Kevin Costner . Whoa , whoa , wait a minute . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Now , what about my friend Gary here , huh ? I mean , he saved you all that money from those two crooks . Hell , he practically saved your life . No , no , no , no ... No , no ! No , no , no , he 's right . You do deserve something . And here is what you are getting . What ? This dump . I mean , what the hell am I gonna do with some crummy sports bar ? I got no reason to tear it down if there isn 't gonna be a parking lot . Are you serious ? Hell , I 've been giving everything else away . Yeah , I 'm serious . I 'll have the deed over in the morning . Well , uh ... Hey , Barney ? Yeah ? Welcome back to the human race . Thanks . But the membership fees are a killer . McGINTY : Have a seat , boys . Tony , buffalo wings . Did I ever tell you how I got this place ? Uh , gee , no , Mac . Well , it was the damnedest thing . I was drinking too much , down on my luck , letting my life go to hell . I won the deed to this place in a card game with a stranger , who told me he was staying at the Blackstone Hotel . Well , I began to feel that I took advantage of the poor slob , so I went to the hotel to see him . But they told me he just disappeared . No forwarding address . Nothing . I 'll send you a Christmas card , boys . Thanks . Take good care of her , son . And she 'll be good for you . Here you go . Well ... this isn 't such a bad deal . What do you mean it 's not such a bad deal ? What am I supposed to do with this place ? We could turn it into a classy restaurant . What ? I don 't know anything about running a restaurant . What do you mean we ? I could run this place . I know exactly what I 'm doing . We will be partners ! No , let me tell - What do you know about running a restaurant ? I practically was born in a restaurant . You worked in your Uncle Louie 's deli . Look , Gare , I 'll quit my boring job at the brokerage firm . I 'll cash in a few of my stocks . We 'll remodel the whole place . Come on , what have we got to lose ? Hey , what are you doing up here ? Oh , well ... Rome wasn 't built in a day . Neither was Colonel Sanders . Great ideas take a while to catch on . Especially mine . And change is not an easy thing . The future can be scary . Especially when it comes a day early . What ? What ? And let 's not even mention the past . Mr. Hobson ? Boswell ? I thought you might want this . It 's the only thing I found in your room that survived the fire . I remember it meant something to you . No , Boswell , thank you very much though , But - I appreciate that . Yes , I understand . Thank you very much . Boswell ? The point is , you can never be sure what was , what will be , and what is . The best thing to do is keep your chin up and take things a day at a time . Well , it looks like we 're staying . I mean , hey , who knows ? Might even turn out okay .

So the vet said . The Happy Valley Resting Place . Every anniversary a card of remembrance will arrive on your table from your four-legged friend . Incidentally , while we 're on the subject , to whom do I send the Bill ? Mr. Litoff , sir . Get onto Spiedel right away and tell him we 're secure . and not to worry . He has Mr. Litoff 's personal guarantee . Will there Be anything for half an hour ? I don 't think so . Has Mr. Litoff had his Breakfast ? Two three-and-a-half-minute eggs and a grapefruit . I ran his Bath for him . 95 degrees Fahrenheit . Where are you going ? To take Dancer for a walk . Get me Sullivan . Try and get that Zurich number . - Good morning . - Good morning to you , sir . What a marvellous dog . I used to have one myself . - They need an awful lot of exercise . - Very true , sir . - Have you an appointment ? - I dropped in to see Mr. Litoff .

Must 've Been the Worcestershire sauce and clamato juice . It 's us that 's moving . The Litoff Organisation never stands still . So I see . Could you remain motionless for one moment to have a little look at these . These our diamonds ? Being smuggled out of the country By someone named Rhodes . - He crashed his car and is now in hospital . - Interesting . How did you get them ? I was in the right place at the right time . - What ? - Shall I take these in for Mr. Litoff 's signature ? - Why 'd you return them ? - assumed they 'd Be worth something . They 're worth something . To anyone , even you . Say , 5,000 pounds ? a conservative estimate . They 're worth 10 times that . I 'm not greedy and not fool enough to sell on the market . I think it 's worth 5,000 to get them Back . Mr. Litoff would like to speak to you . Yes , sir . Pegram here . - What is wrong with everybody ? - Wrong ? I don 't follow . Follow , my foot ! - Why hasn 't the copper deal gone through ? - We 're waiting for Wall Street . - We ? - I am waiting . You 're not queen or archbishop . I want the deal to go through today .

You 're wasting your time . I 'd Be willing to Bet that you 'd say you 'd never met him . - Rhodes ? Employee like myself . - I don 't see the similarity . Pursuit of that line is unrewarding .

Go on . all right . Thanks . - I 'll only Be about fiive minutes . - Fine . a man in a doctor 's housecoat and a mask . Correction. an educated man . How do you know ? He knew enough about medicine to check his temperature and pulse and to enter it in the correct column . - Educated and enterprising . - Very .

Now . - Looking or Buying ? - Buying . - Boyfriend , husband , lover ? - Does it make any difference to the tie ? Certainly . Colour of hair , eyes , disposition . We Believe a man should change his neck drawers as often as he changes his mood .

She is , sir . Tell me , Glover , what is Mr. Litoff like ? The kindest of men , sir . a privilege to work for . - Mr . Steed , madam . - Thank you , Glover . Here we are again . are we in Business ? I put your proposition to Mr. Litoff . He authorised payment of 4,000 pounds . 4,000 ? I thought we had talked about 5,000 . Once he has made a decision , I 'm not empowered to amend it . Can 't you go Back and ask ... It wouldn 't Be any good . This is not a street market . I 'm not entirely satisfiied . You can always put those diamonds on the market . If you did , we would prosecute . Or you could have me knocked on the head and taken Back . Those are hardly Business methods . - Shall we hold ? - Sell . But Mr. Litoff said ... Once again , Mr. Steed . You know very little about the Litoff Organisation . Fear of publicity isn 't necessarily an indication of honesty . It would Be wrong to say that publicity is feared .

I joined the Litoff Organisation 14 years ago as a chartered accountant . a woman in a world of pinstripe and grey flannel. an alien . Mr. Litoff gave me a job and taught me everything I know . If he died tomorrow , my name would mean nothing . Shining publicity can have its disadvantages . - Do you resent that ? - No . My vanity would like to Be fed occasionally . Credit where it 's due . - He 's a remarkable man . - Very remarkable . I can 't sign that . It 's a personal account . - He 's had his nap . You can go in . - Very good . Well , Mr. Steed . 4,000 .

She wants to speak to you . - I was just telling ... - Come in . I 'm sorry . I had no idea Mr. Rhodes 's injuries were so serious . " Without regaining consciousness . " Isn 't that the phrase ?

Must Be open season for Blackmail . You 're the 2nd this week . Your husband did something which would 've cost him his job had he lived .

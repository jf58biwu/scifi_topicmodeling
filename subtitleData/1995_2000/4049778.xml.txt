 Warp 5 ... warp 6 ... warp 7 . I 've reached critical velocity . Okay , everything looks good on this end . Fire up the new engines . acknowledged . Engaging transwarp drive in four ... three , two ... Transwarp on Iine ! Warp 9.2 ... 9.3 ... My vector 's drifting . Try to stabilize your field symmetry . Got it . Warp 9.6 ... 9.7 ... I 'm reading a fracture in the port nacelle pylon . full power to structural integrity . Warp 9.9 ... 9.95 ... I 'm approaching the threshold . But the nacelle isn 't holding . Tie in auxiliary power . It 's no use . I 'm breaking up ! I 'm breaking ... You 're dead . It 's the pylon again . Every time we get close to crossing the threshold , the subspace torque rips a nacelle off the shuttle . What about a duranium alloy ? We could try using it to reinforce ... I thought about that already . It 's too brittle . More coffee ? well , you look like a happy bunch . We 've hit a wall . Oh . well , maybe I can help . Great . Do you know anything about quantum warp theory or multispectral subspace engine design ? No , but I 'm a quick study . What are we working on ? Do you have anything to eat ? Sure . There 's some KaIavian biscuits somewhere in the kitchen . I guess I 'II go find them myself . fill him in . NeeIix ... it wouId take too long to ... What are you saying ? I 'm not smart enough ? I 'II have you know I did two years as an engineer 's assistant aboard a TrabaIian freighter . I 'm weII-versed in warp theory . Okay , okay , we 'II tell you . We 're trying to break the maximum warp barrier . Nothing in the universe can go warp 10 . It 's a theoretical impossibility . In principle , if you were ever to reach warp 10 , you 'd be traveling at infinite velocity . Infinite velocity . Got it . So , tha-that means very fast . It means that you would occupy every point in the universe simultaneously . In theory , you could go any place in the wink of an eye . Time and distance would have no meaning . If Voyager achieved warp 10 , we could be home in as long as it takes to push a button . Wow ! And you 're working on this ? We discovered a new form of dilithium in the asteroid field we surveyed last month . It remains stable at a much higher warp frequency . The problem is , every time we simulate crossing the transwarp threshold , the nacelles get torn off the ship . I remember there was a time when I lost a warp nacelle going through a dark-matter nebula . This is a very different problem . I realize that . I 'm just using it as an example . As the ship went through the nebula , it sent out a dark-matter bow wave . eventually , so much pressure built up , it tore the nacelle from its housing . Now , maybe the same thing is happening to you . No . The simulations don 't indicate any kind of subspace stress on the nacelles . Wait a minute . What about the shuttle itself ? What do you mean ? Maybe we 've been looking in the wrong place . What if the nacelles aren 't being torn from the ship ? What if the ship is being torn from the nacelles ? The hull of the shuttle is made of tritanium alloy . At the speeds we 're talking about , that alloy could depoIarize ... And create a velocity differential . The fuselage would be traveling at a faster rate of speed than the nacelles . That means , we just have to set up a depolarization matrix around the fuselage . That 's it ! NeeIix , you 're a genius . I have no idea what they just said . Warp 9.92 . The pylons are secure . Everything looks good . 9.97 ... eight ... nine ... Warp 10 . You 've crossed the threshold . You 've done it ! And there 's been no damage to the nacelles . When you came to me a month ago and said you had a way to cross the transwarp threshold , I thought it was more of a fantasy than a theory . congratulations to all of you . So we can try a manned test flight ? What 's your flight plan ? I 'II bring the shuttle up to speed . The second I cross the threshold , I 'II cut the engines , drop out of warp and come about . After that , we 'II analyze the shuttle 's sensor logs . Once we know it 's safe to travel at transwarp , we 'II try a more extended flight . To be honest , it 's almost frightening . Up till now , it 's all been theory . I never thought it wouId actually happen . Are we ready for it ? In the Iast couple of centuries , we 've always managed to use new technologies wisely . I 'm confident this time won 't be any different . Besides , there 's no way to put the genie back in the bottle . AII we can do now is keep moving forward ... carefully . well , good luck , Mr. Paris . If this works , you 'II be joining an elite group of piIots- - OrviIIe Wright , neil Armstrong , Zefram Cochrane ... and Tom Paris . I kind of like the way that sounds . I thought you might . Come in . Oh . Captain ! I , um ... At ease , Mr. Paris . I know it 's late . Can I ... get you anything ? No . Thank you . Now , why do I get the feeling this isn 't just a social call ? I 've just spoken to the Doctor and it 's his opinion that we let Ensign Kim make the test flight . May I ask why ? He checked over your biometric readings from the shuttle simulations . He says you have a slight enzymatic imbalance in your cerebellum . So ? I know it doesn 't sound like much , but he can 't predict what 'II happen when you cross the threshold . He believes there 's a small chance that you could suffer a brain hemorrhage under the subspace stress . How big a chance ? Two percent . Two percent ? ! I 'II take that chance . There 's no reason to . Ensign Kim is capable of piloting the shuttle for this mission . Yeah , he 's capable . That 's not the point . What is the point , Mr. Paris ? well , it 's hard to explain , but ... this is my flight . Your flight . When I was a boy , my father used to tell me that I was special , that one day I 'd do something significant . My teachers at school , all the kids , everyone used to say , " Tom Paris is going to do something important when he grows up . " obviously , that didn 't happen . This isn 't about personal redemption . We 're talking about medical risk . Your life could be in danger , and we need you . Captain , this is the first time in ten years I feel I have a life to risk . You 're sure about this . Captain , I 've never been so sure about anything . please . please , Iet me make the flight . Good luck , Lieutenant . Torres to Bridge . The prelaunch sequence is complete , Captain . acknowledged . Ensign Kim , depressurize the shuttle bay and open the space doors . Aye , Captain . Bridge to ShuttIecraft Cochrane . You 're cleared for launch . Aye , Captain . See you at warp 10 . Cochrane to Voyager . AII systems are nominal . I 'm increasing speed . We 'II keep up with you as long as we can . Warp 7 , warp 8 ... How 's his diIithium matrix holding up ? There 's a slight variance in the warp field , but nothing to worry about . Okay . Torres to ShuttIecraft Cochrane . You 're clear for transwarp velocity . acknowledged . Engaging transwarp drive in four ... three ... two ... Warp 9.7 ... 9.8 ... 9.9 ... He is exceeding our maximum velocity . I am switching to Iong-range sensors . Warp 9.95 ! He is approaching the threshold . Engine output at maximum . velocity ... warp 10 . Yes ! Transwarp engines are stable . So are the nacelle pylons . I 'm going to ... Oh , my God ... . Oh , my ... Lieutenant , can you hear me ? Captain , he just ... just disappeared off sensors . Increase sensor gain to maximum . Nothing . I can 't find him . He 's gone . I 've done three full sensor sweeps . No sign of the shuttle within five parsecs . Tuvok , could the shuttle have been destroyed ? I don 't believe so . Sensors indicate that he did cross the warp threshold . If that 's true , then he could be anywhere in the universe . We 'II just have to keep searching our small corner . Run a multispectral sweep . I want to see if ... Captain , there 's a quantum surge off the port bow . Something is coming out of subspace . Janeway to Paris . He 's alive , but his life signs are weak . Bridge to Transporter Room 2 . Beam Mr. Paris directly to Sick Bay . Commander , bring the shuttle aboard . I 'II be in Sick Bay . Aye , Captain . His life signs are normal . A few elevated serotonin readings in the hypothalamus . From what I can tell , he 's just ... asleep . Can you wake him ? I don 't see why not . Wake up , Lieutenant ! Are you all right , Tom ? I 'm back . We tracked you until you crossed the threshold . Then you disappeared from our sensors . Do you remember what happened ? Oh , yeah . I was ... I was staring at the velocity indicator . It said warp 10 . And then , as I watched it , I suddenly realized that I was ... watching myself as well . I couId see the outside of the shuttle . I couId see Voyager . I couId see inside Voyager . I couId see inside this room . For a moment , I was everywhere . I mean , everywhere , Captain . With the Kazon ... back home , with the klingons , other gaIaxies- - it was all there . I don 't know how else to explain it . It was like ... well , no , it wasn 't like anything . well ... I 'm glad you had a good time . How did you get back to Voyager ? . I saw that you were looking for me , so I took the new engines off-Iine and ended up back where I started . But ... Oh , it 's starting to slip away . It all was so vivid , and now ... Tom ! Oh , I 'm fine . How 's the shuttle ? You brought it back without a scratch . The onboard sensors confirm that you did it . You made it to warp 10 . congratulations , Mr. Paris . You just made the history books . We should download the shuttle 's sensor logs , analyze the telemetry they picked up during the flight before we make another attempt . You 're not going anywhere- - at Ieast not for a few hours . I have some tests I 'd Iike to run on your majesty before I release you back into the realm of ordinary humans . You may ... proceed . We 'II download the logs . I 'II let you know what we find . Janeway to Kim . We 're ready . acknowledged . I 'm downloading the logs into the Engineering computer core . This data describes , literally , every cubic centimeter in this sector . It 's over five billion gigiquads of information . It would appear that the theory of infinite velocity is correct . It may be possible to occupy every point in the universe simultaneously . Then , it 's just a matter of navigation . If we could figure out how to come out of transwarp at a specific point ... this could get us home . Oh , it could do more than that . It could change the very nature of our existence . Think of it . There would be nothing beyond our reach . This telemetry is giving us an invaluable record of the sector . We can use it to make a star chart . Transfer the shuttle logs to stellar Cartography for analysis . Right . This is a new blend . I 'm calling it " Paris delight . " It 's in honor of you . What ? Oh ! Oh , thanks . That 's very flattering . I can tell . well , you might as well get used to it . You 're a hero now . I wish I couId say it was nothing . Oh ! Oh , I wish NeeIix would name something after me that tasted a little better . It smells okay . No . Trust me . You 're taking your life into your hands . So I think the next step is to try to duplicate the first shuttle fIight- - verify our results . I agree . We have to confirm that none of this was a fluke . But I do think that we should increase the shuttle 's memory core by at Ieast ... What ? What 's wrong ? I don 't think that coffee is settling too well . You want to go back to Sick Bay ? No , no . I 've seen enough of the Doctor for one day . Oh ... on second thought , maybe I should ... Torres to Transporter Room 2 . medical emergency . Beam Lieutenant Paris directly to Sick Bay . I can 't lock on to him . His pattern keeps changing . Torres to Sick Bay . We need a medical team in the Mess hall right away . Hang on , Tom . Hmm . It looks like he 's having an allergic reaction . What did he ingest ? Just a cup of NeeIix 's coffee . It 's a miracle he 's still alive . This is strange . What is ? He 's definitely having an allergic reaction ... to the water in the coffee . He 's allergic to water ? I don 't know how this is possible , but ... it appears that his entire biochemistry is changing . His electrolytes are breaking down , interstitial fluids are congealing . The alveoli in his lungs are mutating . He 's no long processing oxygen . What should we do ? Stand back . Computer , erect an isolation field around the surgical bay . Computer , remove all the air from within the force field and replace it with 80 percent nitrogen and 20 percent acidichIoride . He can breathe ... for now . What 's happening to him ? I have no idea , but I assume it had something to do with his experience on the shuttle . His cellular membranes are deteriorating . He 's dying . I need to know more about what happened on that shuttle and I need to know it now . Radiation levels , unexplained anomaIies- - anything . You 're losing me , aren 't you ? I 'm going to die . You 're too stubborn to die , Mr. Paris . I want to try high-saturation radiometric therapy . It might slow down his cellular mutation . " Here lies Thomas Eugene Paris beloved mutant . " A fitting epitaph , but I don 't intend to let you use it just yet . Radiometric emitters are charged and ready . Begin with 45 rads per second . Great . Now it 'II read " beloved radioactive mutant . " No effect . Increase the dosage to 85 rads per second . I 'm going to try inhibiting the cell mitosis with a bio-suppressor field . A big funeral with lots of pretty girls all crying ... except Torres . Torres doesn 't cry . Do you ever notice that ? I don 't trust people who don 't cry . Of course , my father ... he 'd say , " Crying is a sign of weakness . " I never believed that . Do you cry ? It 's not in my program . Shame . You know , it 's funny . What I remember most about being a kid are the times I spent in my room crying . I liked my room , though . It was quiet in there . people 'd leave me alone . I 'd keep the door Iocked- - read , play games . I lost my virginity in that room . Seventeen . Parents were away for the weekend . I 'II note that in your medical file . His lymphatic system is collapsing . Increase dosage to 98 rads per second . Pepperoni ! God , I 'd love a pepperoni pizza with Kavarian olives right now . I 'm starving ! His life signs are criticaI- - maximum dosage . Oh ... kiss me . What ? Not you . Her . She can 't breathe the atmosphere in here . Consider it a last request . Sorry , Tom . If we let down the force field , you 'II suffocate . Oh , what 's the difference ? I 'm dying anyway . Do me a favor . When I 'm gone ... call StarfIeet Headquarters ... and tell Dad that I did it . tell him ... Prepare to activate the neural stimulator . Ready . Now . Again . Again ! No neural activity . We can try to revive him . His cell membranes have degraded . There 's nothing more we can do . Computer ... remove the acidichIoride gas from the isolation field ... and deactivate the field . It will be necessary for us to perform an autopsy on the Lieutenant 's body in the morning . until then , I ... suggest you get some rest . You 're alive . Wha- - what 's happening ? AII of your internal organs are functioning again . In fact ... you seem to have an extra one . What ? You have ... two hearts . I have 30 seconds before Security picks up this transmission . I 'm sending you all current information on the warp 10 shuttle flight . Warp 10 ? That 's impossible . Not anymore . Lieutenant Paris crossed the threshold this morning . He survived ? In a manner of speaking . It 's all in the file . This should prove my worth to you , Rettik . We 'II see . His body is going through some sort of mutation . His DNA is rewriting itself . To what end , I don 't know . Does this have anything to do with the enzymatic imbalance you found ? No . Can you stop it ? So far , nothing has worked . The mutations are unlike anything in starfleet medical records . His internal organs are being rearranged . Some have atrophied and been absorbed into his body . And there are at Ieast three others that have appeared and have no identifiable function at all . What about his brain ? There are neuro-eIectricaI transmutations at work . His synaptic patterns are changing almost every second , but he does still recognize me ... the ship . He knows who he is . - Can I talk to him ? - Of course . But I feel I should caution you that while he still is Tom Paris , he 's becoming something else as well . His personality is erratic , unpredictable . There are moments of lucidity interspersed with almost ... deranged behavior . I 'II keep it in mind . Pretty disgusting , huh ? You 've looked better . How do you feel ? Like a lab experiment gone wrong . well , we 're trying to put that experiment right . The Doctor 's working on a way to restore your DNA to its ... Why ? Excuse me ? Why ? What I 'm becoming will probably be better than who I was . Lieutenant , you know that 's not true . Oh , yes , it is . Admit it . Part of you will be glad to see me gone . I 'm the Maquis traitor who sits on your Bridge and insults your uniform , remember ? We 're all concerned about you , Tom . We 're here to help you . No , you 're not . You 're trying to take this away from me . Take what away from you ? What I 'm becoming . How do you know this isn 't good for me ? How do you know this isn 't the best thing that 's ever happened to me ? That 's a possibility , and then again , it could kill you . We need to find out what 's going on . You 're lying ... just like him ... just like everyone around here , always lying , always telling me that I 'm doing a good job , that you 're glad I 'm on the ship , but none of that 's true . Why can 't you just say it ? ! You 're jealous that I broke the transwarp barrier and now you 're hoping I 'II die ! You 're right , Doctor . I don 't think there 's anything I can do here . Wait , Captain . I 'm sorry . please come back . I know you 're doing what you can . It 's just ... I 'm scared . I didn 't mean to lash out at you . What you 're going through would scare any of us , but you have to hang on , Tom . We 're doing everything we can to help you . I know you are . And I know you 'II fall ! You know ... I used to look up to you , but now you seem so small , so insignificant . You don 't even know what ... what ... what ... Doctor ? The rate of genetic mutation has accelerated by 12 percent . I want you to run a nucIeogenic scan to determine how much of his original DNA is left intact . In the meantime , I 'm going to see about treating him with ... Doctor ! What is it now , Mr. Paris ? I need to talk . So I 've noticed . Is it urgent ? I 'm rather busy right now . Urgent . Yes , urgent . Let ... me out of here . I 'm afraid that 's not possible . please ... I can 't stay here . I have to get off this ship . Leave Voyager ? . Why ? I ... understand . It 's all so clear now . What do you understand ? The present ... the past ... they 're both in the future . The future is in the past . I beg your pardon ? Listen to me ! I am more ... I 'm everything . Let me go . Go where , Tom ? I can 't ... please ? please ! Something tells me we 'd better hurry . I believe the answer lies in forcing his DNA to revert to its original coding . Once that occurs , his body should return to its former state . How do we do that ? We destroy all of the new DNA in his body . His cells will have to use the original coding as a blueprint . But the only way to destroy the mutant DNA is with highly focused anti-proton radiation . Anti-protons ? The only place on this ship which generates anti-protons is the warp core . exactly . I 'd Iike to place Mr. Paris in an isotropic restraint and then infuse it with controlled anti-proton bursts- - a tricky venture , but I see no other alternative . We 'II have to take the warp core off-Iine . Then I 'II need about three hours to set up an interface . In three hours , there won 't be anything left of Mr. Paris to save . We have to make the attempt within an hour- - at the most . Get moving . What 's your status , Lieutenant ? The interface is charged and ready . Infuse him with a two-second anti-proton burst . Take the warp engines off-Iine . bleed off .057 AMUs of anti-proton radiation . Shunt it through the interface . Transfer underway . Doctor , the mutated DNA in his liver cells has begun to deteriorate , but the original coding isn 't taking over . I don 't understand . This should be working . We 'II have to increase the duration of the bursts . Lieutenant , prepare a five-second burst . also you 'II need to begin depoIarizing ... My God . Lieutenant ! call Security ! Lieutenant , what 's happening ? I got it right now ! Shut it all down . This is a IeveI-3 security alert . AII hands report to duty stations . Janeway to Bridge . Report . Paris broke out of confinement in Engineering . He used a phaser on the port plasma conduit . We have power failures all over the ship . Where is he now ? We 're having trouble tracking him . We can 't get power to the internal sensors . Tuvok has security teams searching deck by deck . I 'm on my way to the Bridge . Oh , oh ... Phaser discharge on Deck 6 . localize it . I 'm still having trouble with internal sensors . It came from somewhere between Sections 21 and 27-AIpha . Tuvok doesn 't have any security in that area . Chakotay to Tuvok . We think Paris may be on Deck 6 . deploy security to Sections 21 through 27-AIpha . Commander , someone 's depressurizing shuttle Bay 2 . What ? ! There 's a launch in progress . Tractor beam . It 's off-Iine . Tuvok to Bridge . We found the Captain 's phaser on Deck 6 , but there 's no sign of her . Maintain a sensor lock on that shuttle . I 've got main power back . Engage warp engines . follow them . Aye , Commander . They 're approaching warp 9.9 . Increase speed to match . Warning . Nearing maximum warp velocity . structural collapse is imminent . Are we in tractor range ? No . And they 're still accelerating . Warp 9.97 . Warning . At present speed , structural failure in 45 seconds . Reduce speed to warp 9.5 . Keep a sensor lock on them as long as you can . I 've lost them , Commander . They 've gone to transwarp . First Officer 's Log , Stardate 49373.4 . It 's taken us three days to locate the shuttle . It appears to have dropped out of transwarp in an uninhabited star system . I 've re-examined the data on Mr. Paris ' transformation and I think I understand what 's happening to him . The mutations we observed are natural . natural . The changes in his DNA are consistent with the evolutionary development of the human genotype observed over the past four million years- - increased brain capacity , the loss of vestigial organs ... Are you saying Lieutenant Paris is evolving ? That 's my theory . The only difference between natural evolution and what happened to Mr. Paris is that his changes took place over a 24-hour period . Somehow , traveling at infinite velocity accelerated the natural human evolutionary process by millions of years . It 's possible that Mr. Paris represents a future stage in human development . although I can 't say it 's very attractive . What do we do about it ? I think my anti-proton approach was correct . However , I 'II need to intensify the treatment to restore his original DNA . Bridge to Chakotay . Bridge to Chakotay . Go ahead . I think I found the shuttlecraft , Commander . It 's on the fourth planet in one of the jungles near the equator . acknowledged . Tuvok , have a security team meet us in Transporter Room 3 . There are traces of human DNA . It 's them . But I have to admit- - I 'm not sure which one is the Captain . The female ... obviously . I don 't know how I 'm going to enter this into the log . I Iook forward to reading it . First Officer 's Log , supplemental . We 've transported the Captain and Mr. Paris back to Sick Bay . As for their " offspring , " I 've decided to leave them in their new habitat . I 've eradicated all traces of the mutant DNA from your system and restored your original genome . congratulations . You 're human again . Thank you , Doctor . Captain , it 'II take some time for your genetic codes to stabilize . I 'd Iike you to remain in Sick Bay for the next three days ... just to be safe . Excuse me . Captain , uh ... I 've thought about having children . But I must say I never considered having them with you . Captain , I 'm sorry . I-I don 't know what to say except ... I don 't remember very much about ... uh ... you know . What makes you think it was your idea ? Sometimes it 's the female of a species that initiates mating . But apology accepted , nonetheless . You may be interested to know I 'm putting you in for a commendation . regardless of the outcome , you did make the first transwarp flight . Thank you , Captain . Is there something wrong , Lieutenant ? I don 't know . I guess this whole experience has left me feeling a little overwheImed- - flying at warp 10 ... evolving into a new Iife-form , mating , having alien offspring ... You 've broken more than one record . That 's for sure . Breaking the threshold . It was ... incredible . But somehow , it doesn 't mean as much as I thought it wouId . Oh ? I guess I went into this looking for a quick fix . I thought making history would change things- - not just my service record ... my reputation . If I 'm not mistaken , you 've changed quite a few minds on this ship . You 've earned a Iot of people 's respect and admiration . Yeah . But I 'm starting to realize that it 's not other people 's opinions I should be worried about . It 's mine . It seems , Captain , that I still have a few barriers to break . I just hope they 're not theoretical impossibiIities . Somehow ... I don 't think they will be .

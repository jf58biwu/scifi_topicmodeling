 [ Music playing ] [ People chattering ] Hold it . Press . Go ahead . " And second on the bill is the Goth rock band Stoker who gets the Alice Cooper Award for tryin ' . " What 'd he say about me ? He said you need drum lessons . I 'm gonna kill him . You 'd think after all these centuries you could take a little criticism , huh ? This is Mina . She heard you were lookin for a girl singer , and she 'd like to audition . That 's cool . Yeah , so is she . She 's a runaway and she 's got no relatives . Hello , Mina . ( Renfield ) All right , guys , let 's go . Ten minutes . Come on . Hey ! 10 minutes . I , uh , like ... You wanna hear me sing or somethin ' ? I brought a demo tape . These guys makin ' you nervous ? No , I ... They 're makin ' me nervous . Guys , I 'll be out in a minute . I , uh , want you to know that I 'll do anything to be in the band . No , no , no , no , no . That won 't be necessary . [ Sighs ] Good . Because the last couple of bands ... Shh ! It 's not my way . [ Mina screaming ] [ Loud music playing ] I 'm everything you never wanted to be I 'm everything you never wanted to say Dance with you Yeah , dance with you And I 'll take and take and take And I 'll take what 's yours is mine And break and break and break away from you Yeah , away from you And then pray for the things that I can 't resist Pray I don 't get another broken lip Hey , I know the first thing that I can 't resist Hey , I know the first thing is a broken lip Broken lip ( Quinn ) What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds , where it 's the same year , and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you can 't find your way home ? ( voice ) Sliders . Maybe your timer 's malfunctioned . Timer is working fine . Rickman is still here . There is no sign of a wormhole trail . Well , then , why can 't we find him ? [ Sighs ] You know , you 'd think someone who sucks brain to stay alive would stand out in a crowd . And where are all the coma patients he usually leaves behind ? Maybe he 's disposing of them by now . Or maybe nobody 's seeing that the bodies are connected . You think we should tell the police ? Tell them what ? That we 're from another universe , just sliding through looking for a maniac named Rickman ? You got a better idea ? Yeah , I do . I say we split up . We hit the hospitals , we find out if there are any coma patients , see where they 're from and follow the trail . That is a better idea . Yeah . Hey . You get lucky or run over ? You 're gonna have to speak up . I think I blew a few frequencies last night . How was the concert ? Hmm . The band was pretty hot . Especially the lead singer . Well , not according to this review . Hey , listen , I talked to a few people last night . Two of those missing girls were seen at Stoker concerts before they disappeared . You think Rickman 's grabbing them from the mosh pit ? Come on . I don 't know . Maybe there is something to what she just said . Well , you better make that coffee to go . We 'll fill you in on the way . Oh , hey , could I catch up with you ? I really didn 't get a lot of sleep . I would think you 'd be willing to give up a little sleep if it meant finding Rickman . If you don 't get his timer , you don 't get the coordinates to go home . I 'm working the night shift , okay ? You are going to rock concerts and having fun . I think there might be something there . I 'm gonna check it out again tonight . You want us to go with you ? Uh-uh . I 'll be fine . [ Door closes ] Do you want me to stay , Father Rickman ? You run along . I can let myself out . It 's so good of you to visit him . I 'm sure he knows you 're here . It 's the least I can do for one of my flock . Now , I 'll be back to see you before I slide . Try and stay alive till then . It would make my life so much easier . Excuse me . [ Car horn honking ] Bad music . Bad music . Really bad music . Signal noise is more interesting than that crapola ! I hate this job . ( Eddie ) I 'm a music critic , not a reporter . [ Engine faltering ] Hell . [ Engine faltering ] [ Screams ] Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh , God ! Help ! Help me ! Help ! Help ! Who made you music critic ? What gives you the right to judge ? I mean , do you play ? [ Music blaring ] [ Screaming ] What you wrote really hurt my feelings ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . So I 'm no Matt Sharp , but I never dropped a beat in my life ! Let me show you . One , [ clicking ] Two ... No ! ... three , four ! [ Screaming ] [ Engine revving ] [ Yelling ] One , two , three , four . [ Crashing ] [ Laughing ] ( woman on PA system ) Dr. Schriber . Dr. Schriber , Pediatric ICU . What are you doing ? Uh , delivering some flowers . To him ? He 's a John Doe coma patient . Who 'd be sending flowers to him ? I guess everybody 's got somebody . Here , make sure they get water . [ Door opens ] ( Rembrandt ) This doctor says he 's had about three in one month . Now , the first one was about the time that Rickman arrived . The most recent was a couple of weeks ago . Now , two of the victims were living on skid row . The third was a college girl . Three out of four are drunks . What do you make of that ? Well , Rickman knows that if some vagrant disappears , nobody cares . Still , that doesn 't explain about the girl . Yeah . Hey ! ( Maggie ) Hey . We 're gonna check out skid row . You wanna come ? I 've got something better to do . Like what ? Dig up Rickman . You mean , like , from the ground ? I saw his name on a death certificate in the county records . Why were you looking there ? I 've been checking morgue records whenever I could . If he 's gonna die someplace , I 'm gonna know about it . Look , I 've done a lot of things since I started sliding ' . I 'm just not up to robbing ' graves . Why would he use his own name ? All of us in the military were given special I.D. Tattoos that only appear at the time of death . Name , rank , and serial number . Yeah , it still seems like a long shot . Don 't you wanna go home ? More than anything . Well , then we have to dig him up . We have to make sure the timer 's not buried with him . [ Sighs ] You better hope so . Here you go . Grab this . It just says you 're donating your blood to our favorite charity for a pair of Stoker tickets . Next . [ Woman chattering ] How did you do ? I 've located five more donors that meet your DNA criteria . I 'm gonna need more money . I thought we had a deal . That was before bad things started happening to people on the lists I gave you . I see . But you could forget about that if the money were right ? [ Clearing throat ] [ Playing ] If ever you were lonely You never let on , you never let on If it was up to you and you only You 'd never be wrong , you 'd never be wrong You 'd never be wrong 'Cause you were falling behind [ clapping ] Who 's there ? You have a beautiful voice . I-I 'm sorry , I saw the keyboards and I ... I just couldn 't ... How long have you been watching me ? Since last night . It 's you . It 's been a long time since I 've heard a voice like that . I 'm looking for a singer for the band . How would you like to audition ? No , I ... I couldn 't . I 'm traveling now . I 'm not stayin in one place too long , you know ? Sounds like you 're already in a band . [ Chuckling ] No . I always wanted to be . Well , the least you could do is come and meet the guys . They 've gotta hear that voice . Yeah . I could do that . Sure . [ Screaming ] ( Rembrandt ) You know , there could be more than one guy named Rickman on the planet . ( Quinn ) Little late to bring that up , isn 't it ? I checked the phone book . There 's two Rickmans , both accounted for . How deep did they stuff him ? [ Banging ] I hit something . Put your light over here . ( Quinn ) Coffin number 7226 . That 's it . [ Grunting ] Here , I 'll do it . I got it . You sure ? I got it . Be there , you son of a ... [ grunting ] It 's not Rickman . But he left a calling card . That 's a pretty sick joke . Where are you goin ' ? Gonna check out skid row . What about the grave ? [ Grunting ] I dug it . You two fill it . You planning ' on makin ' a habit of this ? Only till I know he 's dead . ( Wade ) Nice hands . Where 'd you learn to play like that ? We all have classical training . I sort of taught myself . It makes no difference how you learn . The important part is making music . [ Sighs ] What 's in this , anyway ? It 's an old family recipe . Would you like some more ? Uh , a little . Harker , take care of the lady . Here you go . What 's with Renfield ? Can 't he keep this place stocked ? We 're almost out of supplies again . Perhaps if you didn 't drink so much , it would last longer . Hey , I 'm the one running around all day getting business done . Not in front of our guest , Harker . You know how it is . You spend a lot of time with someone and you end up getting on each other 's nerves . [ Chuckles ] Yeah . I know that one . A toast . It 's always good to have some new blood in the group . ( band members ) Hear , hear . [ People chattering ] Oh . Excuse me . Fill out the form . If you qualify , we pay $ 27 for a pint of whole blood . If you have certain antibodies , we pay $ 42 . We 're not buying sperm this month . I 'm not selling . Then you 're in the wrong place . I just had a question . I 'm not a medical doctor . If you have doubts , get tested . Well , that 's what I 'm wondering . What kind of testing do you do here ? Standard blood workups . No DNA matching ? Well , that 's not necessary for what we do here . Well , if I wanted that done , where would I go ? I wouldn 't know . Excuse me . People are waiting . Excuse me , do you know where Stoker 's playing tonight ? Do you think we should say something ? Like what ? A few words . I mean , we are burying somebody . [ Sighs ] Suit yourself . [ Sighs ] You gonna bow your head ? To , uh , whoever you are , I hope this time that , uh , you can rest in peace . Amen . You wanna say something ? Yes . I hope we get to make a phone call . [ Police radio chattering ] [ Music blaring ] [ People cheering ] No frustration and you 're fine Make no aggravation You don 't know where you belong And you don 't know where you went wrong A victim of your own affliction Death bed Death bed Death bed ( Maggie ) Is there a human voice I can talk to ? [ People chattering ] Yes , I 'd like to leave a message . [ Sighs ] Yes , I 'll hold . Tell him if this gets as far as a strip search , I 'll kill him . Yeah , I 'm still here . Yes , could you please tell him that I 'm in Sybil Brand for grave robbing and I 'd like to get out as soon as possible ? Yes , that is the message . Seriously . ( male voice ) All new inmates are to report to the shower rooms for inspection and delousing . [ Sighs ] Next thing ... Thank you . Yeah . [ Sighs ] [ Crowd yelling ] ( Quinn ) Wade ! Wade ! Who 's that ? He 's a friend . Quinn , what are you doing here ? I need to talk to you . This is Morgan and Harker . She 's got a great voice , man . I was singing with their band . I heard you . You were good . Really ? Can we talk ? It 's about Rickman . It can wait . We wanna go party . [ Crowd yelling ] You wanna come with us , Quinn ? No , thanks . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm having fun . I haven 't had any fun in a really long time . ( Quinn ) Wade ! Wade ! Wade ! Wade ! Wade , can I talk to you for a minute ? Wade , can I talk to you for a minute ? Wade ! Wade ! [ Choking ] She said later . [ Crowd whistling ] He could have killed you . He still might . Who are you ? Name 's Van Elslinger . She your girlfriend ? No . Ha . Makes it easier . They may drain her . The less emotion here the better . What are you talking about , " drain her " ? What 's going on ? Take it easy , man . Come on with me to my office . It 's just around the corner . I 'll explain everything . ( Van ) And this is what Stoker sounded like back in 1957 . [ Music playing ] But they called themselves the Goodtones . I got recordings of them on 8-track , an LP , a few 45 's , and some reel to reel . ( Quinn ) It 's the same group ? Yep . I did a frequency match on their voices . It 's the same . I 've found pictures of these guys goin ' all the way back to the Civil War . They 've always been musicians . Sometimes they disappeared for years , probably going to some other country . And everywhere they 've gone , people have disappeared and died . They took my wife . Her name 's Charlotte . They 're serial killers ? No , they 're vampires . What do you mean , like Dracula ? I don 't know the reference . He 's a famous vampire where I come from . One of the best bloodsuckers around here was named Nixon . [ Sighs ] So you 're saying vampires really exist ? Where 've you been ? It 's been a felony since 1897 . Maybe you 'd prefer to call them " hematologically challenged " ? Why don 't the police just take care of them ? They can only do so much . People have to look out for themselves . Do you know where they took my friend ? Yeah . They been livin ' in a museum that 's been closed for repairs . Come with me . Help me kill them all and we 'll get your friend back . Here . Any piece of wood right through the heart does the trick . What is this ? Paint balls filled with holy water . Listen , we gotta do something fast . They 're about to leave on a European tour . That 's why they 're stocking up on blood . They 're keeping the blood they 're trading for concert tickets . Yeah , charity begins at home . Smart , eh ? Four guys at a couple of pints adds up to a few bodies . Bankin ' it lowers their profile . Listen , we 've got to get Morgan today before he makes your friend one of them . Why do you think he 's gonna do that ? Because if he wasn 't gonna turn her into a vampire , she 'd be dead by now . [ Animal howling ] ( Morgan ) Yeah , it seemed like a good idea at the time . [ Laughing ] Whoo ! Mmm . No , I-I 've had enough . Thank you . So , you never answered my question . [ Laughing ] I don 't know how to answer it . I want you to hear something . [ Woman singing ] She sounds like me . [ Chuckling ] [ Music stops ] I told you I looked a long time for a voice like yours . A voice that touches me . [ Sighs ] It 's the one thing missing in my life like the one thing missing in your life . I watched you on stage the other night , Wade . You belong up there . We can have the perfect life together , you and me . Making music , sleeping all day , partying all night . Staying forever young . [ Laughs ] Bob Dylan . Who ? Y-Y-You don 't do the song ? No . [ Chuckles ] But you could teach it to me if you come on tour with us . Are you saying you want me to join the band ? Yes . What ... What 'd the other guys say ? I get what I want , Wade . And I want you . [ Panting ] You don 't know how good this feels . And how ... How bad I feel because I have to say I can 't do it . L ... I can 't miss the slide . The slide ? You know , I met my wife at a Joplin concert . Janis Joplin ? Yeah , we both liked those old hippie bands . The Stones , the Dead , Santana . You know , Joplin 's gotta be in her 50s , but she looks like a real grad student . She 's a real health nut . Oh , man . It 's okay , it 's just a security guard . I 'll handle it . Uh , we 're just waiting for a tow , Officer . We 're fine , thanks for checking . Please step out of the car , sir . [ Gasping ] I 'm always around just in case some moron like you is in the neighborhood . [ Gasping ] You all right ? Yeah . Come on , let 's drag him over here . You 're still up ? Sunrise in 10 minutes . You know where she 's from ? The Midwest ? She 's from another world . If you say so . It 's true . The guy named Quinn invented a timer that allows them to slide into parallel worlds . Really ? I 'm so tired of bein ' hunted . If we could travel to another world , we 'd be safe for at least a couple centuries . Then we could move on . I 've told her to get the timer . She 'll do what I tell her . If we 're leavin ' , what do you wanna do about the blood ? You might as well pick it up . We 'll have a blowout before we split . ( Quinn ) Would you hurry up ? ( Van ) Just one more . Just one more . There . I got it . Man , I cannot believe you just did that . Hey , listen , cutting off their heads is the only way to be certain that they 're dead . ( Quinn ) Look , it 's Wade . Give me your keys . I gotta follow them . No , no , no . I need you here , man . Can 't do it alone . There 's too many of ' em . Come on . The timer 's not in the hotel room . Who has it ? Any one of ' em could have it . All right . Where do we find ' em ? Remmy and Maggie are in jail . They left a message . For doing what ? Grave robbing ' . Nice . ( Van ) See , you got your body , you got your soul or your spirit . It the spirit gets trapped inside the body at the time of death , it freaks out . To stay alive , it needs blood . So you become a vampire . Can the spirit ever get set free ? Well , that 's what you do when you put a stake in their heart or cut their heads off . You 're setting ' em free . I never heard a decapitation sound so positive . Let 's try over here . Aren 't there only four members in the band ? I told you they made some converts . It 's one of the missing girls . [ Coffin creaking ] I got the guitarist . Oh , geez . ( Quinn ) Is it Morgan ? It 's Benji , the night clerk from the convenience store . Do we have to kill all of them ? Yeah . Any one of them could convert your friend . Might as well start here . Quinn , if you find my wife while we 're searchin the museum , let me know . I want to free her myself . [ Screaming ] [ Vampires grunting ] ( Quinn ) I think we 're gonna need more stakes . Oh , yeah . Okay . [ Vampires grunting ] It 's gonna be getting dark soon , and we slide in a few hours . Well , it 's about time . Do you have the timer ? Nice to see you , too , Wade . Where is the timer ? I don 't have it . Quinn 's got it . We need to find him . Wade , is something wrong ? No one 's heard from him since last night . He said he was goin ' down to skid row . I 'll start looking for him there . You guys go back to the hotel and wait for me . Okay ? [ Vampires grunting ] So happy to disturb you . [ Vampire screaming ] [ Grunting ] So , that isn 't a good sign ? Sunset . Boogie time . [ Creaking ] Oh , my God , it 's my wife . Oh , I love you , Charlotte . Forgive me . [ Screaming ] [ Grunting ] [ Screaming ] [ Vampire screaming ] [ Groaning ] Come on . L ... I can 't move my legs . He broke my back . I 'll carry you . No time . No time . Get away . Get away . I 'm not gonna leave you here . No , I wanna stay with her . Go on , you know it 's the right thing to do . Get Morgan . That 's the only way you 're gonna save your friend . Oh , geez . Go . Lock and load , rock and roll . [ Vampires grunting ] [ Creaking ] Come on , Wade . He needs me . Yeah , well , Quinn needs all of us . So come on , let 's go . Take me to him . Let 's go . Hey ! Hold on ! She just said , " I have to go to him , " then they drove off . That was the last I saw of her . We slide in five hours . Five hours to find Wade and save her from some vampire ? His name 's Morgan . This guy , Van , told me that we have stake him before she makes her first kill . Why is that ? She takes blood , she becomes one of them . Forever . Uh , I don 't know , Q-Ball . We 've seen a lot of things . I 'm havin ' a hard time with this one . You come with me , I 'll make a believer out of you . Why 'd she have to get herself into all this mess ? She 's been feelin bad since Arturo died . Somethin ' comes along that makes you feel better , you go with it . She hasn 't been havin ' fun in a while . Yeah ? Well , who has ? Now , where 's Maggie ? She went down to skid row to find you and Rickman . [ Knocking on door ] That could be her . Whoa . Take it easy . This is the guy that took Wade . Where is she ? She 's with Morgan . He wants the timer . He 'll trade you the girl 's life for it . Okay ? Just be at the nightclub in two hours . And get off of me . You got any garlic in that bag ? What are you doing here ? Why don 't we go in the back where we can talk , my son ? But I have people waiting to sign up . And I have your money . [ People chattering ] This is more like it . I have some new names for you . I 'll print up a list . [ Door clicking ] I thought you were gone . Yeah , I got one box left . All right , thanks for everything . [ Door closing ] Rickman . I knew you 'd be the one to find me . And I 'll be the one to kill you . Not this time . There 's only half a carton ... [ gun firing ] [ People exclaiming ] [ Panting ] [ Panting ] One hour . There 's been a wormhole activated . Bye-bye , Rickman . You sure you 're up for this , Maggie ? Don 't worry . I only have one major screwup a day . It 's not your fault you missed Rickman . Yeah , well , next time , I 'll be armed and I 'll shoot first . Yeah , and what if you shoot the wrong priest ? I 'll do extra Hail Marys . [ Fluttering ] What the hell was that ? Really big pigeons ? [ Grunting ] Did I make a believer out of you yet ? Oh , yeah . That 's affirmative . [ Music blaring ] I 'm a little rusty . I 've been playin ' drums too long . Where 's Wade ? Show me the timer . I need to know she 's all right . She 's with Morgan . Bring her to us , we 'll give you the timer . Silver crucifix . Heavy metal . Very conductive . [ Buzzing ] [ Gasping ] [ Crashing ] [ Glass shattering ] Where 's the timer ? I 've got it . [ Groaning ] [ Groaning ] That sucked . [ Grunting ] ( Quinn ) Remmy . Remmy . [ Groaning ] You all right ? Come on . [ Groaning ] Yeah . I 'll stay here with him . Go get Wade . [ Groaning ] Lot of good that did me . [ Door creaks ] I 've got the timer , Morgan ! Here it is ! This is what you wanted ! Let me see Wade ! [ Motorcycle engine revving ] Don 't hurt him . ( Quinn ) Wade , stay there ! Here it is . Let her go ! Don 't hurt him ! [ Groaning ] [ Morgan screams ] I 'm sorry . It must have been some kind of spell . [ Crying ] Just my luck , huh ? I finally really like somebody and he turns out to be a vampire . [ Laughing ] Shh , shh , shh , shh . It 's all right . No , just ... I want to explain to you . When ... when I was with those guys up there , with the band , I felt like I really belonged . Like I wasn 't alone . You 're not alone , you 've got us . Do I ? Always . I 'm sorry if I haven 't made that clear lately . Maybe I just need to hear it more often than some people . [ Electronic beeping ] [ Whooshing ] I hate to leave without getting Rickman . We 'll get him . It 's just gonna take time . Yeah , well , he just made it harder , that 's all . Was I really good , or were you just saying that 'cause you 're my friend ? You were really that good . Maybe we 'll come back and see Joplin . Ha ! I 'd be down for that .

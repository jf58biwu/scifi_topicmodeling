 Sometimes things work out . Sometimes they don 't . Sometimes , no matter how well you plan your foundation , the roof falls in ... Kaboom ! Nothing left but the rafters . Take my best friend Gary , a man born to have kids . Instead he 's got a newspaper that tells tomorrow 's news , and one about-to-be . - Are we ready ? - ... Ex-wife . - Guess so . - Guess so . Which goes to show , when it comes to the future , it 's not what you know that counts , it 's what you do when you get there . To single life ... again . Welcome back buddy . We missed you . Thanks a lot . Gar , look , it 's gonna take some time , but believe me , you 're better off without her . You really think that , don 't you ? You got to get into the spirit of things . Look around you . Look at all these chicks . Look at her . Gar , you are a free man . Think about it ... the thrill of the hunt all the action . - Yeah , the cold pizza for breakfast . - Exactly ! - You know what she said to me ? - Who ? Marcia . We 're at the lawyer 's office . She turns around to me , and you know what she said ? She wants you back . I give up . - She says to me . - No hard feelings , huh ? How 's that ? It 's been fun . Call me sometime . Man , that 's rotten . - Thank you . - No , the Cubs ... - they 're losing again . - What else is new ? Hey , Cheech , give me another crownie . - I got to go . - Wait a minute .

Actually , I could use a Slurpee . - Chucky ? - Amy Handelman . - Who ? - Chuck , there 's a seat over here . - Who is that ? - A doctor . - Excuse me . - Really ? Chuck ? - Don 't look over there . - Chucky ! Wait a second Chucky . She seems to like you . Maybe we ... Chuck . Chuck Fishman . Look , it was two years ago , Steamboat Springs . A junket . I was desperate . She 's been stalking me ever since . Okay ? Chuck ? - I 'll call you . - I 'm in the book . Can 't wait . Gary , come on , now move . Go . Now . So that 's what I have to look forward to ? You call that the thrill of the hunt ? Hey , sometimes you gotta take what you can get . Oh , that 's a motto to live by . But not you . You 're going to make out like gangbusters . You 're a good lookin ' kid . You know ? You 're one of those " aw , shucks " kind of guys that girls really go for . You got nothing to worry about . Of course , you live in a dump , but you get tomorrow 's newspaper , which , I may add , is one hell of an icebreaker . Uh-huh . Hey you got to use what you got , buddy . I mean , it 's a jungle out there . Dating game Darwinism . Only the strong survive . You 're going to do good at this , trust me . I was good at being married . Which explains why you 're here with me tonight . Sorry . Forget about her . What have you got to lose ? What do you mean what have I got to lose ? A family , a home , - kids . You know I want kids . - Why ? What do you mean , why ? They 're nothing but trouble . You got to change diapers , - and all that snot and drool it 's disgusting . - Stay here . Okay , we 're going to do this thing , right ? Jimmy , Roy . I know what you 're planning on doing , don 't do it . The guy behind the counter , he 's got a sawed-off shotgun . He 's got medals for marksmanship . Now , listen . Here 's 50 bucks . That 's all you were going to get anyway . All right ? Look , you got a chance for a scholarship . And you got a girlfriend at home who loves you . What do you want to throw all that away for huh ? Aargh . And while you 're at it , do something about your muffler ! Let 's go . - Where were we ? - Movies . Look , all right. as long as we 're on this side of town , nothing 's lost . We can catch the Jackie Chan festival at the Arts . It starts at 8 : 15 .

Well , my parents hate me , and I hate them . No , I don 't think so . Look , your mom she 's sorry she yelled at you , and your dad , he 's very proud of your math scores . But they forgot my birthday . No . Look in the back of the garage . There 's a brand-new blue 10-speed . Why don 't you go back inside ? It 's past your bedtime . Go . Go on . - All right , what were you saying ? - 8 : 20 . We blew it . Okay , plan B. We 're downtown . The Brew View . They 're showing " Jaws " one through four . Perfect - we 're in time for Jaws 3 . That 's in 3-D . Hey , Gar , did you hear me ? I said that 's in 3-D . There 's a line , lady . Here . - You 're a nickel short . - Hey , what 's the holdup ? She has food stamps , and now she 's a nickel short . I don 't seem to have . What do you want me to put back ? I ... - How about the milk ? - No , I need that . - The bologna then ? - No . Look , couldn 't I just owe you the money ? I live just down the street . I come here all the time . What about the bread ? Come on ! It belonged to my grandfather . He told me it would bring me luck . Yeah ? Well , it hasn 't worked so far . Hold it . She 'll pay with this . Y-you , thank you . I can pay you back . Yeah , I know you can . This is a 1913 Liberty Head nickel . He was going to sell it for just over $ 1 million tomorrow . Take it to a rare coin dealer in the morning . Seems like you should keep it in the family . All right , all right , are you done ? We could still make it . We got five minutes . Hey , Gar . One more stop . You 're impossible . You can 't let this gig be all consuming . I mean , even Batman had a social life . You remember all those parties at Wayne Manor ? You 're forgetting about the little people ... your friends . What about , what about my needs , Gar ? This will just take a minute . Uh , Senator.Uh. not tonight . You see the guy over there with the Bulls hat ? He 'd love to get a picture of you and the young lady . And he 's not a Bull .

Then she gets the job at the law firm , and ... Well , you know , Gary , people change . I mean , look at you . Yeah , a lot of people have families . Instead , I get a cat . Heroes never have it easy . The only reason anyone would ever call me a hero is ... because I get this paper . Here . Maybe you get that paper because you 're a hero . Don 't tell me about " hero " . I couldn 't even save my own marriage . - Zeke . - What ? - That 's what I was going to name him . - Who ? My son - the first one , anyway . - Ah ! Well , what if it was a girl ? Zeke . Oh , well , that makes it easy . He was going to play hockey , you know . - Zeke ? - Yes . - The boy or the girl ? - It doesn 't matter . Just asking . Go camping , sleep under the stars , hang out at the circus . You know I like the circus ? You want to talk about this or not ? I mean , because if you do , there 's plenty of time if you still want to have a kid . People have them every day . Oh , you 're telling me . What ? Oh , Marissa , you 're not going to believe this . What ? You 're not going to believe this ! Okay , here 's the deal . I had this dream last night ... Ralston Purina up six points . What do you say ? You 're dreaming stocks ? I 'm dreaming condos in Aspen . A house in Lake Geneva . Check it out in the paper , see what it says . It 's worth a try . What ? There is a story here that might interest you . Really ? Why am I suddenly suspicious ? No , no , no , no . It 's good . It 's good . Oh yeah ? Well , where is it ? Sports ? Financial ? Here you go , buddy. page seven . Seven , my lucky number .

The stork came to Chicago on the downtown El yesterday afternoon ... in the unlikely person of Chuck Fishman , local stockbroker . Battling time and rush hour conditions , Fishman came to the rescue of housewife Anne Kellogg ... when she unexpectedly went into labor . I 'm not doing it . Mother and daughter were reported in excellent ... condition at Cook County Hospital . At-a-way , Doctor Kildaire . I 'm not doing it . What 's wrong , Chuck ? You 're going to be a hero . Oh , groovy . Swell . But guess what ? - Chuck ain 't doing it . - Why ? The paper says it turned out fine . What is this , some kind of joke ? What is today , April Fools ' ? - No - Nixon 's birthday ? Oh , I know . This is to get back at me ... for that time I short-sheeted your bed in college . Is that it ? - Oh , no , no . - Oh , I know . It 's when I put your hand in that warm water on your wrist and you peed your pants . Chuck , I don 't , I don 't think you have a choice . Sure I do , and here it is : No . There . Selection made . And you 're in the men 's room , young lady . Call me crazy , but that man has a ... problem with the miracle of childbirth . Hey , Chuck , don 't you think you 're overreacting here a little bit ? - Yeah ? How 's that ? - How 's that ? It says in the paper the mother and baby are going to be fine . - Oh , sure , them . - So , what 's the problem ? What 's the problem ? I 'll tell you the problem . The problem is ... - fluids . - Fluids ? Yeah . You know , like . - blood and stuff . - Stuff ? Yeah . Like ... childbirth stuff . Look , I 've never told this to anyone before , but ... in the seventh grade ... in biology class , you know , when you have to dissect the frog ? Well I opened mine up , and there was this . - stuff in it . - Really ? Weird stuff . Chuck , delivering a baby is not the same as dissecting a frog . Close enough . Hey , I 'll tell you what , maybe it 's a different Chuck Fishman . ... who just happens to look exactly like me . I don 't think so . Well , this is why I tell you never to show me that paper . Now you know how I feel . Yeah ? Except unlike you , I 'm not putting up with it . Mm-hmm . Kellogg , Kellogg . Anne Kellogg . I 'm out of here . There she is . I knew I 'd find her . Come on . Come on . You know this is probably futile ? What are you talking about ? We 're being good neighbors . If you were going to pop out a baby on the grimy ... floor of a public conveyance , you 'd want a little advance notice as well . Your concern is touching . God , what an appetite . Look at her go . - Okay , wish me luck . - Just out of curiosity , what are you going to tell her ? I don 't know , but I 'll think of something . I 'm quick on my feet . It 's her , the girl from the bar . Gar . I 'll be right back . Gar . - Yes ? - Hi . Uh . I 'm , uh . Chuck . Berkalsi . You don 't know me . Board of Health . Not now . Please . Hey , lady ! Stop !

Get pregnant , the whole world thinks they 're your obstetrician . Success . She 's taking a cab . It worked . Okay , now check the paper , see what it says . - What ? ! ? - Congratulations . Twins . - So , you handing out cigars ? - Very funny . The stork came early to a downtown elevator yesterday afternoon in ... the person of stockbroker Chuck Fishman . All right , that 's enough . Who came to the aid of an expectant mother ... and delivered twins . So where would this elevator be ? It doesn 't say . Somewhere in Chicago . Whose the lucky mom ? Name withheld by request . It 's not fair . I don 't know what I did to deserve this You 're asking us that questions ? I can 't believe you didn 't ... Oh , great . Hey , guys , I got to go . Yeah , thanks for all your help , Gar ! You know , you 're being really weird about this . It 's just basic biology . - All right . - It 's pretty simple . First the mother 's water breaks . Well , actually , it 's not water . It 's amniotic fluid from inside the uterus . Then the contraction begins , she pushes , you help receive the baby , you cut the umbilical cord - and wash out the placenta , and then you ... - Stop it ! This isn 't biology ; this is Poltergeist . You know Chuck , you can 't run from fate . Sooner or later , it 's going to catch up . Maybe I can 't run , but I can hide . In my apartment . Under my bed . Thirty-five floors up . Barring the woman rappelling down my chimney , I ought to be all right . I 'll see you later , I 'm getting out of here . - Good luck . - Another foot and a half should do it . Excuse me ! You got a problem here ! You 're telling me . Wife packed salami again .

You got to be joking , right ? - Nope . - She came to your hotel room ? Why ? I 'm not sure exactly . - Well , what did she say ? - She said she wanted to talk . - She said . - I 've been thinking . About ? About us . Us ? You 've been thinking about us ? As in yesterday ... at the lawyer 's office us ? I don 't know . You seem different . More ... involved . - Look , Marcia , I think ... - Is there someone new in your life ? And you said . I think you should go . Look , I know this sounds crazy , but ... if you want , we could have dinner . You know , sometime . - Well , you know , I don 't , I , I ... - How about tonight ? - Huh ? - And you said ? - I told her I 'd think about it . - Oh , brother . Well , what am I supposed to do ? She 's my wife ... my ex-wife . For the moment , anyway . I 'm telling you , this thing 's driving me crazy . I mean , I got the paper , I got Marcia ... and I keep seeing , I keep , I just keep getting distracted . How 's Chuck ? - Last I saw of him , fine . - Yeah , this ought to be safe . Hi . Oh , dear . Oh , no . - So how did it go downtown ? - What ? The water main break ? Did you stop it ? - Not exactly . - Oh , distracted again , huh ? Well , let 's just say that , uh .

Just remember to keep your spirit 's up ... and your eyes wide open . And remember , there 's always tomorrow .

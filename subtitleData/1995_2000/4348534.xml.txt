 Are you the one ? Who are you ? Are you the one ? - The one ? - Are you the one ? Forget all about me . Just a dream . Just a dream . Hi . Can I play ? Hey , you , new girl , what 's your name ? Katherine . Kat for short . All right , Kat . If you wanna be one of us , you 're gonna have to pass the initiation . - What initiation ? Your name 's Kat , so how about cat and mouse ? Except now you 're the mouse . You run away , we count to 10 and chase after you . And if we catch you , you get initiated . - What does that mean ? - One , two ... - What 's gonna happen ? ... three , four . - We 're gonna get you , mousie . - Run ! Five , six , seven , eight , nine 10 ! We 're gonna find you ! We 're gonna get you , mousie . Where did she go ? Find her ! Find her ! Find her ! Don 't worry , everything will be fine . - Who are you ? - Your new best friend . Here they come . Leave everything to me . Here she is ! Cats have claws . Initiation time . The mummy 's tomb was buried by an earthquake some 3000 years ago . This is what it probably looked like . Cairo House has asked for our expertise , facilities and immediate attention . Who exactly was buried here remains a mystery . Legends of murder and supernatural occurrences surround the tomb . Our job is to identify the mummy and , if possible , cause of death . The reconstruction of a Middle Kingdom tomb here , in the house ? - I must be dreaming . - Dreaming ? Well , hopefully more pleasantly than I did last night . An Egyptian ritual disembowelment at the hands of my closest friends . Intriguing . Yeah , Dr. Freud would have a field day with that one . That , or those legends really do have some teeth . - Excuse me . - Any word from Nick ? He 's on his way back . Plane landed at 1 : 30 this morning , it took eight hours to clear customs everything should be off the ferry by late afternoon . - Doesn 't leave us much time . - That 's why I need everyone here . No , I 'll be right there . Sorry , I can 't help . There 's been a mix-up at Kat 's new school . I gotta go . - Nothing serious ? - I 'll let you know . Well , let 's start building the database . Here at Claremont , we expect our girls to behave like young ladies . Your daughter attacked another student . We have several witnesses . No , I 'm sure there must be some kind of mistake . Katherine has never done anything like that . Jane Hankin , the victim of the assault , suffered a dislocated elbow as well as cuts and scrapes . Quite frankly , when your daughter lied ... Excuse me . My daughter does not lie . - Really ? - Yeah . Then I suppose it was her friend Callie . - Who ? - Callie . I thought you would have heard her name before for sure . She 's your daughter 's imaginary friend . Imaginary friend ? You see ? We had no choice . Your daughter is suspended for one week . And in order to be readmitted , she must write a letter of apology to both Jane Hankin and the school . Is that clear ? Perfectly . Very good . She 's quite an artist . Good day . I hate her . She doesn 't believe me . Okay , I 'm listening . Well , you wanna tell me about your imaginary friend ? I understand her name is Callie . I hate this school . Everybody 's so mean to me . Everybody except Callie ? That 's right . I 'm never coming back . No , no , no . That 's not the way we do things around here . You can 't just quit because you had a bad day . You know , it didn 't exactly make my day either . Getting called to the principal 's office . Kind of brought back bad memories . You got called to the principal 's office ? - Really ? - Yeah . You think you 're the only outlaw around here ? And you 're also not the first woman in this family who has punched somebody out because ... Probably because they deserved it , but ... Now , I am not saying that I approve of this but , Katherine , I know that I 've spent a lot of time away from home lately and , well , between my practice and The Legacy ... Do you know what they 're doing there this weekend ? They are actually studying a real Egyptian mummy . The mummy . We can see the mummy . We 'll have lots of fun . - Can we go ? - Where ? To see the mummy . I 'll have to call Derek , but why not ? On one condition . You promise me that you will write those letters of apology the minute we get back . Deal ? - Deal . - Okay . Better attitude . Hit the road . Let 's go . Move it , move it , move it . - Pretty impressive , huh ? - Yeah . - So how 's it going ? - Not bad , just checking the manifest of these contents . - You want a hand ? - Sure . Can you take this downstairs ? - Okay . Gentle . Have you got it ? - Yep . - Okay . Thanks for letting us spend the weekend . We 'll stay out of your hair . Well , I can actually use some help determining the mummy 's age and possible cause of death . Sure , anything I can do . Look at all this stuff . Derek , this is fantastic . Oh , Katherine , have you ever seen anything like this ? Yeah , just like the pictures in my history book , Mom . Really ? - Now , okay , what are these ? - Canopic jars . They hold the embalmed vital organs of the deceased . I think that 's the intestines . - Oh , charming . - Come on , I 'll show you where we 're setting it up . - Okay . Kat . In here . Callie , you scared me . Everything 's here . It 's all here . You and I are gonna have a lot of fun this weekend . Katherine ? Here , catch . Katherine , your mother is waiting . I 'll take that . What 's that ? Oh , you hurt your hand , huh ? A little scrape . You better show your mom . Okay . That 's a bad man , isn 't he , kitty ? We must make sure the bad man doesn 't see too much . Kat ? Honey , are you still awake ? Good , because I really need to talk to you before I go to sleep . Lately , it seems like we haven 't had much time to spend with each other and I don 't want you to think : " My Mommy 's too busy , she doesn 't even care about me . " That 's not true . You 're the most important thing in my whole life . And you know something , Kat ? No matter what 's going on , you 're always in my heart and I am always in yours . And nobody or nothing is ever gonna come between us . You understand ? - Good girl . - I love you too , Mom . This bear 's pretty tired , so I think you 'd better put your head down . Good night . Night-night . The jackal god Anubis . Guardian of the gateway to the underworld . The high priest probably wore that exact one during the embalming of our downstairs guest . Like the one in your nightmare . Yeah . Sacred objects like these , especially the ones used in rituals seem to possess powerful psychic impressions . All right , set up a Qumlink to Cairo House and tell them to send everything they have on this tomb . - Right . You 've got it . Egyptian Pharaohs were buried in pyramids just like this one . Hidden passageways to confuse grave robbers and trap doors so they 'd plunge to their death in a nest of poisonous snakes . Sometimes even worse things would happen . Worse ? What could be worse than falling in a nest of snakes ? They 'd be buried alive with scorpions and tarantulas . How do you know all this neat stuff ? Can 't tell . I made a pact , and if I break it my tongue will fall out and my eyes will turn black and explode . And I especially can 't tell about the mummy in the basement . What ? Secret things . I suppose we can make a pact . But you 'd have to promise never to tell anyone . And you 'd have to promise to help me . Help you ? Do what ? Cross your heart and hope to die ? - Hey , Nick . - Hey , kiddo , how you doing ? - Fine . - Good . What you doing ? I 'm translating the pictures on this sarcophagus into words . What 's a sarcophagus ? Well , it 's this container that 's made to hold the mummy 's coffin . The mummy 's coffin ? Can I take a look ? Well , if Alex would give me a hand we can do one better and you can look at the mummy inside . - Really ? - Really . Okay . Wow , who was he ? Well , we don 't know that yet . But the people in Cairo think that he 's a Middle Kingdom prince but we can 't be sure . - How come ? - Well , for one thing his name isn 't inscribed anywhere . The name is the first thing the dead are supposed to see when they arrive in the afterworld , so that they can properly introduce themselves . - Right , see ? This ? That represents the dead person 's ka , or spirit . You mean like a ghost . Yeah , close . See , the ancient Egyptians believed that everyone had a ka that followed them around in their life and then after they die , their ka lives on . Sounds like a ghost to me . Yeah , sounds like a ghost to me too . It 's ... You know what happens if the ka , or the ghost , doesn 't reunite with its body ? It becomes a real nasty demon . You know , that 's another weird thing . There 's no food offerings . It 's as if someone wanted to make sure this prince didn 't make it into the afterworld . - Well , hello , young lady . - Can I ask you a question ? Yeah . And if I can , I 'll answer you . Okay . When people die they go to heaven , right ? - Yep , if they 've been good . But what if they don 't even know their name and they can 't introduce themselves to God so he doesn 't know how good they 've been ? What happens then ? Well , you see , God would still know who they were ... - Not according to the Egyptians . How could he know who they were if they didn 't even know themselves ? I think you guys should spend more time finding out that mummy 's name , you know . Of course . Another job well done . How can you like these people ? Especially that busybody , Derek , and that priest . I really hate him . I think you 're spending too much time with everyone except me . - But they 're my friends . - Aren 't I your friend ? - You 're just jealous . - Am not . - Let 's play a game . - What kind of game ? Shadow tag . I 've got your shadow , you 're mine . - No , I 've got yours . - No , I 've got yours . No ! Got yours . - Got yours . - No . - Got yours . - No ! All right . See this cartouche ? This is where the royal name should be inscribed only it 's been chipped away . As if someone wanted to keep us from knowing who was buried here . It seems our prince was last in his line . Killed in a dispute between two warring factions . So his father died without a successor . A Pharaoh 's only son , buried without his name . An ignoble end to a noble line . But why ? Maybe whatever 's being sent from the Cairo House will shed some light . - When 's it due in ? - I wish I knew . Let 's get some sleep . We 'll start again at dawn . Okay . - We shouldn 't be doing this . - I need you . I can 't do this alone . We made a pact , remember ? Take my hand . O great goddess bring the ka spirit of this cat back into its body . I offer up my prayers in the presence of the gods . What ? Come on , Callie , you 're making that up . This isn 't gonna work . What are you gonna do ? Open the mummy 's jaw . - No way . - You can 't leave . I 'm not doing it ! Fine ! I 'll just have to get somebody else . But you are going to stay . O great goddess bring the ka spirit of this cat back into its body . Raise yourselh . Your ka shall not perish . - The dead shall walk . - The dead shall walk . - The dead shall speak . - The dead shall speak . - The dead shall walk . - The dead shall walk . - The dead shall speak . - The dead shall speak . The dead shall walk . The dead shall speak . - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall speak ! - The dead shall speak ! - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall speak ! - The dead shall speak ! It 's working . The ka approaches , look . Nice . What the hell is that ? The cat mummy . What 's left of it . Alex found it beside the sarcophagus this morning and that candle burned next to it . - It can 't be as burnt-out as the Cairo transmission . The Qumlink computer 's crisped . I can 't raise them . I don 't wanna use an unsecured line . - Good morning . - Hey . - Hey . - Good morning . How 's Katherine ? Fine . Why ? There was an incident at the tomb . Some kind of ritual with this cat mummy . Perhaps an attempt to revive it . Derek , are you implying that Katherine had something to do with this ? Assuming none of us did it . She was in the house . Oh , so she snuck down to the basement and tried to bring a cat mummy back to life , is that it ? I don 't believe this . All right . I 'll talk to her . And then I never wanna hear another word about this . Nick , I need a thermal imaging of this prince 's mummy now . And there 's a copy of the Book of Anubis in the library made by a member of The Legacy who rode with Napoleon . Tell Philip that I need a translation immediately . All right . Have fun . Hey , boobaloo . What 's up ? She 's pretty . What 's her name ? Is that Callie ? Is Callie here with you now on the island ? Sometimes . Not all the time . Kat , did you go downstairs last night after I put you to bed ? Katherine , were you playing in the basement last night ? - I didn 't do it ! - Do what ? - Callie did it . Callie did everything . - No . Katherine , Callie can 't do anything . Callie is imaginary . No , she 's not . Callie did it . She made me watch ! Just leave me alone ! Imaginary friends are usually friendly , not mischievous . It 's almost like Kat 's using this Callie to get back at someone . Yeah , me . I have a little girl who is very upset that I 'm spending so much time at The Legacy . And I 'll tell you something right now , Derek : If it ever comes down to a choice between my daughter and The Legacy , my daughter wins hands down , understand ? Each of us does what he must . I had another nightmare last night . Really ? It might be some sort of psychic assault being waged against us . By whom ? For what purpose ? Well , it 's either connected to this mummy or perhaps the Cairo House has some other agenda . - I don 't understand . - It 's possible they set us up . The Legacy 's had renegade houses before . What will you do ? Whatever we must . You brought that cat back and I got in trouble ! Don 't worry , they won 't do anything . But it worked . Wasn 't it amazing ? Now all we have to do is the same thing to the mummy . But people are much harder than cats . No . No more . You promised , remember ? Cross your heart and hope to die . So , what do we got ? Severe cranial damage , left hemisphere . - There 's your cause of death . - What 's the discoloration around the mouth ? - I don 't know . That shouldn 't be there . - Want me to take another pass at him ? - Please . So , what else can you tell ? I 'm looking , I 'm looking . Torso , normal . Oh , okay , hold there . Now , see this ? Judging from the development of the bone marrow on the legs and the span of the pelvis the hip joints I 'd say our subject was 8 years old at death and female . - What ? - Our prince was an 8-year-old girl . An 8-year-old murdered princess ? And we do not even know her name . Get the results of the carbon dating ? 1800 B.C. , late Middle Kingdom . - Any word from Cairo ? - Someone sabotaged the Qumlink . Until this is resolved , we trust no one . Recheck the hieroglyphics . - There must be something we missed . - I 'm on it . - Translation , where do we stand ? - I 've gone through the Egyptian funeral procedures . Nothing yet . Search the more esoteric sections . What do I look for ? - Anything to do with strangulation . - All right . - Are you sure ? - I double-checked the translation . I 'm positive . Middle Kingdom . The war between Akhenaton III and the high priest of Sekhmet . The Pharaoh 's daughter was murdered in her sleep . Her tomb was never found . Her name was Senephra . Senephra . So without a name or a proper burial Senephra 's ka spirit would be doomed to haunt the sarcophagus forever . - Wherever it went . - Exactly . No one should know . Tell Rachel to meet me in the control room . There 's something I want her to see . Senephra . You can 't turn back now . We made a pact . You gave your word . Why can 't you do it yourself ? There has to be two . One to chant and one to do the rituals . - But I don 't know what to say . - The priest will tell us . He 's in the library right now looking up things . I want you to go to him . Find out what he 's learned . We have to hurry . - No . Philip 's my friend , I can 't . - You must . Look at me , Kat . Look at me . You will do exactly what I tell you to do , understand ? Alex said you needed to see me . Yes . When was the first time Kat met her imaginary friend Callie ? Two days ago , at school . The day after my first nightmare about the tomb . - The day the relics arrived . - That 's right . Derek , do you think there 's some sort of connection ? Well , we 'll know in a second . Nick ? Okay , here we go . Courtesy of the finest forensic software on the market . A computer-simulated reconstruction of the face of an 8-year-old Egyptian princess . How can this be ? Imagine a Pharaoh 's daughter killed by a jealous priest then buried without ceremony . Vengeance extending beyond the grave . But here ? Now ? Unless her wandering spirit , or ka , can reunite with her body it will haunt her tomb forever . So once it was here at The Legacy , it took the form of Kat 's not-so-imaginary friend ? But why Kat ? Same age , same sex . Her sensitivity to the sight . The ease with which it could manipulate a child . They 're kindred spirits . Okay , but what does it want from Kat ? What it always wanted : A chance to be reborn . Oh , Katherine . You gave me a fright . - What are you doing ? - Translating this old journal . It was written in French 200 years ago . - What 's it about ? - It 's about how the ancient Egyptians buried their dead . And I 'm just about done . There . Finished . Let him go ! Callie , let him go ! I hate priests . Callie , I promise to help you . Please , just don 't hurt him . Please ! Raise yourself ! Raise yourself ! Princess Senephra , rise up ! The mounds of Osiris await . Your ka shall not perish . - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall speak ! - The dead shall speak ! - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall walk ! - The dead shall speak ! - The dead shall speak ! Here we 've got a three-dimensional view of the mummy 's mouth and mandible region . See , the mummy 's mouth is supposed to be open to receive its spirit . What is that discoloration ? I 'd say a thick layer of embalming resin hardened into a shell . Looks like the priest didn 't want her to make it into the afterworld under any circumstances . And after centuries of waiting , not knowing its name , sealed off from its body , the ka of the princess will do anything in its power to reunite with her body . What if it can 't ? Realizing its fate , the spirit will be forced to find someone else 's body to inhabit . Someone compatible . Katherine . Philip . Philip , what happened ? There was a girl . Katherine . Katherine 's in danger . The Anubis . - Where 's ... ? Where 's my translation ? - Okay . No . No , I 've got to find my translation . Okay . Kat , read the words . " Untie the bandages twice which are upon thy mouth . " With this key , the door will be opened . - The dead shall speak . - The dead shall speak . - The dead shall walk . - The dead shall walk . Read ! Be opened , thy mouth With the iron oh heaven I can 't get them open ! - Kat 's in danger . - Anubis . They took my translation . They 're in the tomb . Oh , God ! - Mom ? See , she 's real . - My God . Yes , honey . We can all see her now . Okay , Katherine I just want you to come to Mommy . No ! Mom ! Mom ! No , Kat . Stay with me forever . No ! - Goodbye , Kat . - Bye , Senephra . - Tag , you 're it ! - What ? You didn 't even touch me . I didn 't need to . I got your shadow , so you 're it . Wait , who taught you those rules ? Callie . Mom , why did Callie have to be so mean ? Because she was desperate . But she 's okay now , right ? Right , she 's okay now . - So let 's hit the road , huh ? - Okay . Tag , you 're it ! I got you , okay ? Everything okay ? I was thinking about Kat . Sometimes she reminds me of myself . We are only children once , and I hate to see her robbed of her childhood the way I was robbed of mine . - I 'm sure your father had his reasons . Oh , yes , he did . To prepare me for all of this . You think when you were her age your father considered leaving The Legacy ? I 'm sure he did . But The Legacy was his life , his passion . There was really no choice . For him , for me and maybe for Kat . I got your shadow . I got yours .

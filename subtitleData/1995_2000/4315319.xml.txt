 [ Speaking Chinese ] [ Creature Snarls ] [ Loud Clattering ] [ Speaking Chinese ] [ Siren Wails ] This hold was secured in Hong Kong . I don 't know how this happened . It makes no sense . We found the cage still locked . Two of my men are missing . Who 's in charge here ? You ? - Who are you ? - My name is Detweiler . I 'm the owner of this cargo . I was to be notified immediately of its arrival . There 's an animal in here , damn it . It needs care . - Aren 't you goin ' home ? - I am home . I 'm just feathering the nest . What ya got ? Two merchant marines found dead this morning in San Pedro . In the hold of their cargo ship . Mind if I ask the cause of death ? - On the crime report it says " multiple bite wounds . " - From what ? Well , the Hong Kong manifest has the cargo listed as a dog . A dog ? - A dog dog ? - Yo quiero Taco Bell . That alone is not what drew me to this case . The two men were found inside the container which was locked from the outside . - What happened to the dog ? - Dog gone . Dog gone . Doggone . Yeah , I got it . Did anybody examine the victim , Mulder ? Look , bite wounds are rarely lethal in themselves . I mean , they are not the cause of death . They lead to it through the loss of blood . But it makes me wonder how accurate this report is . Local P.D. wrote it up . Department of Fish and Wildlife is on the case . I got an outside source says it was a dog . I don 't have to tell you how absolutely and completely wrong that seems . - I mean , they were found dead in a locked cage , right ? - Yeah . - Two grown men . - Mm-hmm . You 're not gonna tell me that a dog did this . - Bad dog . - Yeah . [ Barking ] Quiet . JoJo , come on . Shh , shh , shh . That 's enough , now . Come on . Come on . Come on . It 's okay . Hey , get outta there ! Go on , get ! Come on . Inside . Come on , come on . Inside . Inside . Inside , JoJo . [ Barking Continues ] Get outta here ! Go on home ! Go home . ! JoJo ? Here , girl ! Better not be on the bed ! There you are . What are you doin ' , girl ? You nut . Big old lazy bones . JoJo , what are you doin ' - - [ Growling ] [ Snarling ] Stay away . Go on . Go . [ Snarling Continues ] [ Man Screaming , Groaning ] - OfficerJeffrey Cahn ? - Yeah . I 'm Special Agent Fox Mulder with the F.B.I. This is my partner Dana Scully . I think the L.A. field office would have contacted you that we were coming down today . Oh , yeah . I hope you don 't mind . I had a look around the ship with my men . We were pretty thorough . - What did you find ? - Nothing conclusive , really . But I can tell you the dog 's not likely still on the ship . - How 'd you determine that ? - You ever owned a dog , sir ? - Yeah . - Had to clean up after it ? I don 't suppose you can tell us what kind of dog this is ? I 'm not really sure . The man it was shipped to , his name is Detweiler . Dr. Ian Detweiler . - Calls himself a , uh , cryptozoologist . - Cryptozoologist ? Yeah . They deal with animals thought to be extinct . Animals- - Animals that aren 't supposed to exist , like Sasquatch , the Ogopogo and the Abominable Snowman- - Don 't mind him . He 'll go on forever . Did you have a chance to talk to this Dr. Detweiler ? - About five minutes ago . - [ Detweiler ] Officer Cahn , any progress ? [ Cahn ] Agents , Dr. Detweiler . - Are you from the F.B.I. ? - Yeah . - Who should I be speaking to about the theft of this animal ? - What do you mean , theft ? Well , this is a very valuable animal that has disappeared . A rare breed and arguably a priceless specimen . - A breed of what ? - Wanshang Dhole . It 's a canid . That 's an Asian dog . Supposed to have been extinct for the last 1 50 years . Yes . That 's right , actually . - And you have one of these ? - I was on the expedition that caught it . Be that as it may , we now have an unquarantined animal loose . Loose ? This animal 's a little more than loose . It seems to have killed two people . Oh , no , let me assure you . This is not a predatory animal . Chinese folklore has imbued it with mythic qualities . But it doesn 't even hunt . It scavenges . Where 's Officer Cahn ? I just got a report on the radio . Some kind of vicious dog attack in Bellflower . Watch your step . Jake Conroy , age 30 . He was employed as a customs agent by the federal government . The bite marks match those of the victims on the Chinese freighter . In this case , it bit off the man 's hand . There 's some talk in the house ... that he may have been involved in the theft of the animal and then it turned on him . Talk about bitin ' the hand that feeds ya . Well , it does make sense . I mean , a victim and his dog are attacked inside of a house with all the doors shut . It couldn 't have happened unless the dog was being kept inside . - Well , if all the doors were shut , how did he get out ? - Well , then what ? I think we 're speaking in common about an animal we 're calling a dog ... but which displays none of the behavior of man 's best friend . - You mean covering up crime scenes ? - You get a biscuit , Scully . So you 're talking about a dog that has human intelligence ? Well , even if there were such an animal , where would we even begin to look for one ? With a human that thinks like an animal . [ Dogs Barking ] Karin ? Karin Berquist ? Karin ? Karin Berquist ? No . Stacie Muir . I 'm just puttin ' up this fence for her . She 's been havin ' some coyote problems . You two lookin ' for Karin about boarding ? No , it 's actually more of a behavior problem . Yeah . He , uh , doesn 't listen , and he chews on the furniture . [ Chuckles ] Just , can you tell her that the F.B.I. ' s here to see her ? Right this way . Karin will be out in a moment , all right ? Are you sure this woman 's not an authority on bats ? Karin Berquist knows more about canine behaviorisms than anybody on the planet . She 's lived with wild canids and wolves in the wilderness on five different continents . How is it that you know so much about her but you don 't know what she looks like ? I never actually met her . Yet you assume that she 's gonna help us ? No . It 's not an assumption . She is the one who told me about this case . - Oh , so you two are chummy . - Well , I 've read her books . Oh . " The Wolf Inside . Dogs Don 't lie . Better Than Human . " - Better than human ? - She 's not a real people person . Well , she seems to have made a connection to you . All right , settle down . Settle . Karin , I 'm Fox . Fox Mulder . This is my partner , Dana Scully . It 's nice to finally meet you . I wish I 'd known . I don 't get many visitors . Stacy tells me you have a question about behaviorism . Yeah , it 's about the animal I 'm tracking , the one you mentioned in your E-mail . - About its intelligence . - Canids ' intelligence is far superior to ours . if that 's what you want to know . - Intelligence enough to murder ? - Murder takes no intelligence . - It 's a human behaviorism . - What about hunting ? Coyotes use elaborate trickeries to draw out their prey . Many canids do , alone or in packs . - What about a Dhole ? - If you mean the Wanshang Dhole , it 's extinct . Is there any other reason you came here ? No . Thank you , Karin . - Come on . - [ Dog Barks ] - [ Door Closes ] - Mulder . She 's a friend of yours ? - Well , we met on line . - On line ? Two professionals exchanging information . This is Fiedler . I 'm at an alley just south of Cooper in Signal Hill . Looks like something 's been scavenging . I 'm gonna check it out . [ Man On Radio ] Copy that . - [ Clattering ] - Hey ! Hello , sir . I 'm with U.S. Fish and Wildlife . Maybe you 've seen a dog I 'm lookin ' for . Sir ? Can you hear me ? [ Growling , Snarling ] [ Man Screaming ] You wanna catch a killer ? You arrest that crypto son of a bitch who shipped that dog over here . Is it the same dog ? That 's Frank Fiedler over there . He 's a friend of mine . Damn good at his job . You think this kind of thing happens here every day ? No , I 'm sure it doesn 't . We 'rejust trying to catch this animal just like you . Oh , you can catch it . I want to kill it . I don 't think wolf woman is here to speak to me . I 'm just , uh , gonna take a look at the body . - I didn 't expect to see you . - " Dog Eats Dogcatcher . " Story 's all over the news this morning . It 's sort of uplifting . - I 'm joking . Sorry . - Mm-hmm . - That 's okay . - I thought you might use some help . You said that a dog , or a canid , only hunts what it needs . But I 've got four bodies with bite marks on it ... from an animal that seems to kill for no other reason . - Who are the victims ? - There 's two men on a ship that it came in on , a customs agent , and now an officer from Fish and Wildlife . In fact , all these men could have come in contact with the animal before the attacks . Classic dominant , alpha territorial behavior . No , this animal seems to have ranged many miles to make its attacks . In each case , it seems to have outsmarted or tricked its victims . Unlike we Homo sapiens , a canid 's motives are simple and direct . It would be an extraordinary case to find one who kills for sport . Likely we may never know . I 'm sure someone will kill it first . This guy over here ? He claims to have caught it once . Maybe he can catch it again . He 's Dr. Ian Detweiler . - Do you know him ? - No , but I dislike him already . I 've been over the area . If that was my animal , there 's absolutely no evidence of it . No prints , nothing whatsoever I can find . - But it 's still on the loose ? - How did you say you caught it originally ? Oh , this is Karin Berquist . We tranquilized it , after tracking it for two weeks . You admire it , don 't you ? I admire its ability to survive . I think I 'll look around too . Mm-hmm . That 's one strange bird . I 'm leaving my dart gun in the car . I 'm going to live rounds from here on out . I don 't care what the regulations say . I shouldn 't be asked to risk my life . Neither should anyone else . [ Man On Radio ] No one 's asking you to risk your life , Cahn . - Fiedler 's lying dead . You realize that ? - [ Clattering ] - Cahn , are you still there ? - We need more men out here . How many more people have to go down before you guys listen ? Look , I don 't have a photo of this animal . No one 's even seen it . Let 's get more men out here so we can catch it and kill it . If you want pe- - - You scared me . - You kill that dog , and I 'll kill you . [ Berquist ] This man Detweiler said he could find no evidence at the scene . But with very little effort , I was able to find several tracks ... on the floor of the building where the man was attacked . - Did they tell you anything ? - That this is a large , rangy animal ... with primitive , even pre-evolutionary aspects . It isn 't perfectly visible , but with the computer ... I can enhance the print so that you can see it . A fifth toe pad on the right paw . Canids only have four toes . He 's got a vestigial toe pad on his front paws , right there . The dewclaw . Serving no purpose now . Although some believe it was once a prehensile thumb . And that 's what you think the print indicates ? I am told that this animal went in and out of closed buildings . But just yesterday you dismissed the possibility outright ... that a dog , or a canid as you call it , would behave like this . - I dismissed the idea of murder . - But you 'll accept the idea ... that it behaves in every other way likeJack the Ripper ? I 'm just going by the facts . In Chinese myth a Dhole can be evil , capable of opening doors , stealing wives and disappearing into thin air . Maybe there is some basis in reality for this trickster myth . Oh , I 'm fairly certain there is . - Everything okay , Scully ? - How well do you know this woman , Mulder ? How well do you know anybody you meet on the Internet ? She likes to talk . Well , I question her motives . You 're suggesting this case was to get me out here , to meet me ? I 'm flattered , but no . I don 't know this woman , but I 'll go out on a limb and say ... there 's no way she has anything to do with those four people being dead . She 's enamored of you , Mulder . Don 't underestimate a woman . They can be tricksters too . So , Dr. Riley wanted me to give Duke three pills a day . Is one bottle gonna be enough ? - We can get you a refill . - Okay . - [ Barking ] - Duke . - Duke , enough . ! - Can 't you control your dog ? He gets this way with strangers sometimes . - Let 's take him outside . - Okay . Thanks . - Excuse me . Excuse me . You got him ? - Duke , come on . ! [ Barking Continues ] [ Riley ] Good luck . Sorry about that . He 's usually a well-behaved dog . I 'm Dr. Detweiler . I called about the animal tranquilizer . The Telezol . I don 't have much occasion to dispense it . - If I have any , it 's very little . - I 'll take whatever you 've got . - I have etorphine . Can you use that ? - Yeah . - Can I ask what these are for ? - An animal escaped from a pier in San Pedro . Not that dog that 's been attacking people ? I 'm in a bit of a hurry . This dog you 're looking for- - You 're not looking around here ? I 'm afraid we are . Good night , Peggy . Be sure to lock the front door for me , would you ? I 'll lock up back here . - Good night , Sparky . Bye , Dino . - [ Dog Whimpers ] [ Whimpering ] [ Dogs Barking ] [ Barking Continues ] Hey , Buck . What 's wrong , Buck ? What 's wrong , Buck , huh ? [ Snarling , Barking ] [ Sirens Wailing ] Come on ! - Where is he ? - He 's trapped in a kennel . - How 'd it get in there ? - It must have come around back . Lomas , Young , go around back . All right , I 'm gonna open the door . Doc , you 're gonna have to move back . I 'm gonna have to shoot him . I see him ! Did you hit him ? - [ Dogs Barking ] - I think so . He 's down . - [ Whimpering ] - Duke . It 's the wrong dog . [ Police Radio , Indistinct ] - You came out for nothing . - How 's that ? - I took out somebody 's pet . - What kind of pet ? A St. Bernard . It was dark . I just saw something move . Okay , Duke . All done , pal . You 're gonna be all right . Now we gotta find out how you got back in here , huh ? [ Riley Screaming ] I 'm a federal agent . ! I 'm armed . ! If you can hear me , don 't move ! Just stay where you are and tell me if you 're okay . - [ Clattering ] - Mulder ? - Yeah ? - Come take a look at this . I 'll call paramedics . - Where 's Fox ? - Continuing his investigation . Come on . - You 're not working together ? - No . This is my investigation . - Of ? - You . I have no idea what you mean . I thought at first that they were eccentricities . Or affectations . The dark , the clothes . But it 's photosensitivity . Your sleeves cover up skin lesions . It 's why you 're here amongst the humans instead of out in the field . Systemic lupus erythematosis . Lupus , from the Latin for " wolf . " Ironic , isn 't it ? Ironic or perverse ? I 've ignored the symptoms for years . I 've always felt more like a wolf than a person . But not with Mulder . With Mulder , you found somebody you could communicate with . Someone who challenged you . But that wasn 't enough . You needed to lure him out here . I lack your feminine wiles . You don 't believe it , do you ? Not for a minute that there 's an animal out there killing . I don 't believe that this man , Dr. Detweiler , ever caught it . I lived in Asia . I know about the Wanshang Dhole . And if it survived for over a century , it was because it was more cunning than man . More cunning than this man Detweiler ever dreamed of . More cunning than you ? I 'm watching you . You watch , but you don 't see . [ Man On Radio ] Officer Cahn , we have an emergency phone call ... we 'd like to patch through to you . Officer Cahn , are you there ? Officer Cahn , please respond . Officer Cahn , please respond . This is Jeffrey Cahn . Go ahead . We have an F.B.I. agent holding for you . I 'm gonna patch him through now . - Officer Cahn ? - Agent Mulder . I 'm back here at the clinic . Did you know Detweiler had been here ? - Dr. Detweiler was there ? - Yeah , he signed for something . Looks like " etorphine , " " etoraphine . " Tranquilizers . Ampules . - Are you anywhere near here at all ? - Not far . Why ? If you have access to the lab , there 's something I 'd like you to check out for me . I 'll be there in 1 5 minutes . - [ Engine Starts ] - [ Growling , Snarling ] [ Screaming ] - What are you doing here ? - I 'd heard what had happened . I didn 't know how bad he would be . I thought I might get a description of the animal . How did you learn about the attack ? I 'd been in contact with Officer Cahn . I learned through his office . No , you didn 't . No , you hadn 't . Officer Cahn didn 't want to have anything to do with you . He was going to kill it . Does that frighten you ? Please , sir , this is ridiculous . You aren 't hunting this animal . You know it can 't be caught . - Then how could I have brought it here ? - That 's what no one can figure out . Except for Karin Berquist . She knows what was in that cage , and she knows it must be killed . And that 's a thought that she can 't bear ... because she doesn 't want this thing to be extinct any more than you do . - You 're not making any sense . - Oh , I think I am . You went to China looking for that animal . And you may have tracked it , as you claim , but the rest is far from the truth . You found the Wanshang Dhole . But you never caught it . It caught you . You may not have known what was happening at first , but you 're well aware now . That when night comes , you stop being yourself . - That 's insane . - You become the trickster . A shape-shifting man who becomes an animal . - I 've heard enough . - No . You killed because you could . You may have resisted it at first . You may have hated what you 'd become . Eventually it took you over . That 's where the tranquilizer came in . I found traces of etorphine in animal blood at the clinic . You injected yourself with a tranquilizer hoping to stop the killings . But they didn 't and they haven 't and they won 't . [ Quiet Chattering ] I protected you as long as I could . I won 't any longer . I can usually get a sense of a person right away from the dogs . Dogs are the best judges of character I know . I 'm sensing something myself here . I 'm thinking maybe I 've been misled . That you haven 't been totally honest with me about this case . I 've been honest with you , though perhaps not myself . I was looking forward to meeting you . I wouldn 't admit how much . But you might also have admitted what you knew about this animal , that it wasn 't an animal at all . I heard the reports and called you out , if only so you could disprove them . What I knew was it couldn 't be a dog responsible for those killings . It 's Detweiler , isn 't it ? - Yes . - So you knew that and didn 't say ? I only realized it when I saw him . My failure was in thinking I was protecting the animal . That by deceiving you , it might be captured alive . He 's got to be put down , Fox . It 's the only way to stop this . Well , I 've got Scully on him , tailing him , watching his every move . - He 'll elude her easily . - But where 's he gonna go ? To the man he only wounded . To the hospital to finish the kill . [ Dialing Phone ] Scully , it 's me . You gotta get to the hospital . You gotta make sure Cahn is protected . Yeah , he 's in danger . Want to tell me why you pulled me away from the suspect and chained me to this chair ? 'Cause I haven 't seen hide nor hair of Detweiler since I 've been here . That 's aptly put . It 's not yet dark . You should take a load off . We might be here all night . - What do you mean ? - It 's Detweiler . It 's not Detweiler , it 's something he becomes . - Mulder . - Through some blood curse , this man undergoes some kind of nocturnal transformation . He becomes the same shape-shifting trickster as that mythical dog . So is he gonna walk in here , skitter across the linoleum and pee in the corners ? It 's about territoriality . He 's gonna come back here tonight to make sure his dominance isn 't challenged . He 's gonna put down the threat he failed to eliminate when he attacked Cahn . Karin Berquist confirmed it . Mulder , the only thing Karin Berquist is interested in is you . You 're kidding yourself ... if you think that she hasn 't manipulated this entire situation ... for her own purposes . He 'll come here tonight , Scully . You 'll see . [ Dogs Whimpering ] Okay . He 's not comin ' . [ Sighs ] Well , you 've got no argument from me . He 's not comin ' here tonight . Karin knew that . She lied to me . - [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Gasps ] Karin , it 's Fox Mulder . I know what you 're doing . If you can hear me , lock your doors . I 'm on my way . [ Growling , Snarling ] Come on , dog . - [ Snarling Continues ] - Come on . Come on . [ Dogs Barking ] Mulder . Yeah , it 's Detweiler . - You going home ? - Yeah , pretty soon . You think this is your fault . I think that I ... believed her very quickly . I think maybe that was my fault , yeah . - Why wouldn 't you believe her ? - I barely knew her . Well , she had a lot of secrets , that 's for sure . I think that Karin Berquist lived by her instincts . She sized people up pretty quickly , and I think she figured you out to a tee . I think she saw in you a kindred spirit , Mulder . She may not have been able to express that to you . Maybe what she did was the highest form of compliment . [ Sighs ] You gonna be okay ? Oh , this came for you . Thank you . [ Child ] I made this . !

Delta Company clear ! - All right , out ! - Let 's go . Line up ! Face forward ! Turn around and face the other way ! Now ! Fire ! ( sobS ) Mulder ? Answer me ! Dammit ! - I wanna know what 's on that train . - It doesn 't matter now . Our government operates a secret railroad . They put something living on that train in West Virginia . - What more is there to know ? - What the Japanese have to do with it . - How a man named Ishimaru was involved . - That I don 't know . Don 't tell me you don 't know , you smug son of a ... There are limits ... to my knowledge . - I don 't have time for convenient ignorance . - What were you gonna do ? Shoot me ? Just like the men that shot your sister ? - You know them too ? - You wanna know what 's on that train , _ .. _ .who killed your sister ? You find out what they put in your neck . - The implant . - It holds more than I could ever tell you . Maybe everything you need to know . Excuse me , sir . I need your assistance . - I 'm a federal agent . My name is Mulder . - You need my assistance ? I need access to that quarantine car you picked up in West Virginia . Sorry , can 't help you . I 'm a federal agent , sir . I need you to open it . I would if I could , but I don 't have access myself . We pick them up from time to time . What they carry , they never say . Somebody 's gotta be able to get in that car . We 've got a doctor on board . Came on back at Queensgate . He might have somethin ' to do with it . He checked the door . - What 's his name ? - Japanese fella . Dr Shiro Zama . " Travelling with another party " , but I thought he was alone . - Can you take me to his compartment ? - Certainly . This way . Stay here . Knock on the door , but stay away from it . Dr Zama ? Knock again . It 's the conductor , Dr Zama . Open it . Just unlock it , then step away . Why did I study French in high school ? Have you got a safe place to put this ? Yes . What am I supposed to tell the doctor ? If he finds you before I find him , I want you to make him lie on the ground until I get back . OK ? You understand ? - Have you ever used a gun before ? - No . - I just want you to point it at him . - ( gun clicks ) Don 't pull the trigger . That 'll kinda give away the game . - What if he runs ? - Just make sure he runs my way . I 'm feeding the chip impulses . The graph is recording its output . When I remove the current , it changes slightly , _ _ _ _ .but continues . This means the neural network is storing information . - Biological information ? - That was my first guess . You told me the chip was placed subcutaneous to the back of the neck . So it makes sense that it records impulses sent to and from the central nervous system . - But what ? - But look at the graph . Those are reverberatory loops . They show the presence of circular-neuronal activity in the brain . - Memory formation . - The chip seems to mimic that process , .. _ - _ .replicating memories in the brain . - Like a computer hard drive . Yeah , but no hard drive we 've ever seen . This neural network could be collecting information ... _ .and artificially replicating a person 's mental processes . - You could Know a person 's every thought . - Frightening . Anyway , I showed the chip to some of my tech-heads . They weren 't as blown away as I thought they 'd be . - They 've seen this before ? - They 've seen neural nets , .. _ _ .but never one so complex . Nor are they likely to any time soon . What do you mean ? The chip 's so delicate that I destroyed it when I began working on it . But I found something in the silicon matrix - the name of the manufacturer . It 's Japanese , isn 't it ? - How 'd you know ? - It was just a guess . Well , I checked for you . I assumed you 'd want me to . But there 's no record or information on the manufacturer , either here or in Japan . Except for this . We had FedEx , UPS , the postal service , every commercial courier ... _ .go through their records . They found one shipment , _ _ _ _ .sent to a Dr Shiro Zama at a research facility out in Perkey , West Virginia . Well done , Agent Pendrell _ Keep up the good work . Right , thanks . Keep it up yourself . " Keep it up yourself " ? What a doof ! Please ... ( muffled cry ) ( dull thuds ) ( Scully ) Hey ! Stop ! ( floorboard creaks ) Please , don 't Don 't hurt us . Please . Don 't Excuse me ? ( woman screams ) - God , he 's dead ! - No , shh . He 's just got motion sickness . I 'm gonna go find a doctor . Why don 't you just find another bathroom ? Who are you ? Don 't worry . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm an FBI agent . We live here . We 've lived here at the facility most of our lives . What kind Of facility ? The Hansen 's Disease Research Facility . Hansen 's clis ... ' ? - Do you mean this is a leper colony ? - No more . The ... facility 's closed now . Look , I came here looking for a Dr Shiro Zama . Dr Zama isn 't here any more . None of the medical staff is . Where did they go ? Well , they all left . Right before the death squads started coming . What death squads ? That 's who we 've been hiding from . We thought you 'd come to kill us . Like they killed all the others . - How many have been killed ? - Hundreds . All but us . I don 't understand now there were hundreds of people here ... _ .when leprosy is meant to be a treatable disease . Well , it is . Me and the other people back at the hiding place , we 're the last . Our disfigurement forced us into the camps before there was a treatment . - Who were the others ? - We never knew . They began arriving several years ago , but they were kept apart from us . - And they had Hansen 's disease ? - No . They had the Hansen 's deformities . Dr Zama would round them up in groups for treatment . And then the ones that returned always came back worse , .. _ _ .with terrible burns all over their bodies . It 's over there . Oh , my God . There are more of these pits . They just dump the bodies on top of each other . Like they were garbage . ( helicopter ) They 're coming . Wait ! Hey ! No ! Move and you 're dead . ( gunshots ) I found Zama four cars up , strangled , in the bathroom . Get up there and seal off that bathroom . Get word to the engineer not to stop this train until I tell him , OK ? Until I find the killer . Hey ! I 'm a law enforcement officer . - Stay back . - Just put that gun down . I 'm gonna show you my identification . Put the gun down . You idiot ! ( Mulder ) Put your hands in the air and turn around ! Put your hands in the air ! You have no idea what you 're dealing with here . Maybe you should have filled me in before you tried to kill me . Now who are you ? - No . Who are you ? - Answer me ! I work for the National Security Agency . The NSA ? Since when did they start issuing you piano wire instead of guns ? Since we learned there 's a bomb on this train . There 's something on this train , but it 's not a bomb . Throw that here . This car is wired to an explosive device . It armed automatically when I entered the car . - Why ? - Because of what 's in that room . Because if the man responsible for it couldn 't get it out of the country , _ .. _ .he would rather kill it than let it live . - So you killed him ? - The only humane alternative . Given the circumstances . - Put your hands in the air . - This bomb could be wired to anything . The smallest concussion could set it off . If you use that weapon , you take your chances . I 'll take my chances . I 'd like to speak with Miss Scully alone . How did you know my name ? I know most everything about you , Dana . What are you talking about ? I think you know . Who are you ? What is this place ? This was one of the most frightening places on the earth . A place where society sent its monsters to live in shame and isolation . Now their disease is all but conquered . Science has eliminated thousands of years of misery . I 've seen your methods of elimination . What happened to the man who was with me ? What about the people who were in this room ? - They had been exposed . - Exposed to what ? The same thing all these people have been exposed to . Victims of an inhuman project run by a man named Zama _ You mean Ishimaru . You hid him here after the war . He stayed here and he continued his experiments . The ruler of the world isn 't the country with the greatest soldiers , . _ _ _ .but the greatest scientists . Unfortunately Ishimaru began to conduct his work in secret , _ .. _ .not sharing with those who 'd risked much in giving him his asylum . - What was he exposing these people to ? - Terrible things . What kinds of things ? - Have I been exposed ? - I don 't know . Who knows ? Please , I 'd like to show you something that will give you your answers . Agent Mulder ! Do you want us to try prying this door open ? I wouldn 't recommend that . No . Where 's the key card ? It 's in my pocket . Take it out . Slowly . Put it on the table . It 's not gonna work . No ? How did you get in here ? There 's a code , right ? Zama gave you a code just before you killed him . What is it ? Four ones , a four , a seven and a one . 'I - ' I - ' I - ' I - 4-7-1 . I assume Zama would be smarter than to give me the entrance and the exit code . - What ? - He knew he was gonna die . When I used the code to enter the car , it activated the bomb . If you use it again , it will almost certainly set it off . - If there 's a bomb on this train , where is it ? - I don 't know . It could be anywhere . No , it couldn 't . If you activated it coming in , it 's gotta be on this car . - You 're probably right . - Where do you think it is ? I don 't know . You know what I think ? I think you 're a liar . I don 't think you work for the NSA , and there 's no bomb on this train . - You 're choosing a hell of a way to find out . - Shut up ! ( bleeping ) That 's you . Answer it . YSS . YSS . Just a moment . It 's for you . Put it down . - Yeah ? - Mr Mulden I have someone here who 'd like to speak with you . - Mulder , it 's me . - Scully , where are you ? - I 'm in West Virginia . - Who dialled this number ? IVlulder , we 're involved in something , but it 's not what you think . - What are you talking about ? - Whatever is on that train is not alien . - You 're wrong , Scully . - Mulder ; / shimaru Zama-- - He was experimenting on innocent human subjects . He 's been doing it for years , operating out of a leper colony . Whatever his name was , he 's dead . I don 't think this has anything to do with lepers _ The colony was a front . The tests weren 't just on lepers _ They were on the homeless , on the insane . They were brought here and subjected to diseases and radiation tests . - Who told you this ? - The man who handed me the phone . - Why do you believe him ? - Because of what he 's shown me . What ? - What 's he shown you ? - Mulder , I 'm standing in a train car ... _ .just like the one on your alien autopsy video . Only I realise I 've been here before . - What are you talking about ? - This is where they brought me , Mulder . This is where they put the implant in my neck , in one of these cars . It all makes sense , Mulder. lshimaru Zama was using the secret railroad ... _ .to conduct his tests across the country . The women in Allentown , they all remember these cars ... ( distortion ) Scully ? Scully ? - Can you hear me ? - Yeah . So what are you saying ? That Zama abducted these women ? What I 'm saying , Mulder , is that there is no such thing as alien abduction . It is just a smoke screen , created by our government to cover up the biggest lie of all . What about the UFO I saw them working on ? That wasn 't a UFO . It was a piece of a Russian nuclear sub that was raised . More lies . - How can you be so sure ? - Because I have what I told you I needed . Proof . Two weeks ago the president made a public apology ... _ .for secret radiation tests that had been conducted on innocent citizens up until 1974 . - Only guess what . - Those tests never ended . Mulder , listen to me . You have got to stay out of that train car . - Why ? - Because there is a bomb on board . If that bomb detonates , thousands of people are gonna die from haemorrhagio fever : That 's what the test subject inside has been exposed to . Well , Scully , you 're a little late . I 'm locked inside that train car . Then we 've got to get you out of there , because that device is on a timer . - Where is it ? - There 's a ventilation grid on the ceiling . It 's hidden up inside . Step back . Open that . ( slow beeping ) - Did you End it , Mulder ? - Hold on . Oh , yeah . I 've found it . - How much time do you have ? - Little over an hour and a half . Mulder , you 've got to get them to stop that train , so we can get you off of it . They want you to tell the engineer to stop at the next station . - Why ? - So we can get a bomb squad out there ... - _ .and evacuate the train . - You 're breaking up . I can 't hear you . - Did you hear that ? Mulder ? - Scully ? Scully ? ( man ) What 's the next stop ? It 's not on the map . Step aside . Conductor ! - Where are we ? - Iowa . We passed Murray station about 20 minutes ago . All right , listen . I want you to get word to the engineer there 's a bomb on this car . - Bomb ? - That 's right . I want you to tell him not to make his next scheduled stop and to reroute . - You understand ? - I think so . Tell him to choose a place as far from a populated area as possible ... _ .and unhook this car . - What are you doing ? - Let 's move into the corner over there , now . You 're gonna get us both killed . I want you to kneel down and put your hands behind your back . They 'll never be able to find us in time . If what 's here is as important as I think it is , they will . You 're gonna die . You know that ? What do you care ? You were tryin ' to kill me anyway . ( phone rings ) Scully . You haven 't seen America till you 've seen it from a train . - Dammit , Mulder , what happened ? - We 're not gonna make that station . I figured that . Do you have any idea where you are ? No , but I 'm sure they 'll find us . We probably lit up every spy satellite in this hemisphere . It 's the only thing to do , if you 're right about what 's on this car , to reduce the risks . Mulder , if I 'm right , they 're not gonna wanna find you . - But you don 't think I 'm right , do you ? - We 'll wait and see . We 're not waiting for anything , Mulder . We gotta get you outta there . I 'm fielding all offers and suggestions . - They 're not gonna come , are they ? - I said you were making a mistake . Tell me something . You got on this train to kill Dr Zama . Then what ? What were your orders then ? Who were you protecting ? Unless that bomb is as phoney as you , we 've got half an hour to live . Is that part of the plan ? They don 't make provisions for saving my life . What about that thing back there ? What provisions were made for saving its life ? I don 't know . I wasn 't expected to fail . You know what it is , don 't you ? You 're gonna die for that thing . Is it important enough to die for ? What is it ? A plague carrier ? A leper ? We 're both gonna die in here . The difference is , I 'm gonna die quickly . As an employee of the NSA , you should know ... _ .that a gunshot wound to the stomach is the most painful and the slowest way to die . But I 'm not a very good shot . And when I miss , I tend to miss low . It 's a weapon . A weapon ? What kind of a weapon ? Ask yourself , my friend , what could be more valuable than Star Wars ? More valuable than the atomic bomb , or the most advanced biological weapons ? A standing army , immune to the effects of those weapons . That 's what Dr Zama did , didn 't he ? He came up with an immunity to those weapons . He tried to smuggle that thing back to his own country , ... _ .only our government isn 't in the mood to share , right ? They 've been doing experiments since World War II on innocent civilians . But Zama succeeded where the others had failed . And that thing in there ... That 's no innocent civilian . It 's not a leper , either . It 's an alien-human hybrid , isn 't it ? Then again , if that were true , _ _ _ _ .you 'd have expected someone would have been here by now to save it , wouldn 't you ? Yes , hello . My name is Dana Scully and I 'm trying to reach Senator Matheson at home . I 've already tried him at his office . Please , this is an emergency . Can you reach him ? Yes , I 'rT1 at 555-0199 . Thanks . This area code . ( phone rings ) - Yeah . - Mulder ? I think I 've got something here . - What is it ? - I think I may have a code for you . I 'm watching Zama punch it into a keypad in one of the train cars . - What are you watching ? - Your alien autopsy video . You mean I might get my 29.95 's worth after all ? - I 've got six minutes left . Have you ? - Let 's hope not . What 's the code ? OK ... One . One , zero . - Wait . Are you there ? - Yeah , yeah . One , zero ... one . One , zero , one ... And a three . - Then a three . - Three , three . I can 't see the last number clearly . His hand gets in the way . - Tick tick , Scully . - No , I 'm sorry . Um ... - I think it 's a one . - You think it 's a one ? Are you sure ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm pretty sure . And a one . Mulder ? Mulder ! ( gunshot ) OK , call me if you learn anything . Nothing , Scully . The rail operators , the forestry department ... Nobody knows what happened to that train car . Are there any satellite photos ? Senator Matheson nasn 't returned my calls . His aides say he 's out of the country . The administrator at the hospital said someone had called ... _ .and alerted them to your location . I went through the phone records . The call was placed from a phone booth in Blue Earth , Iowa . Did you locate the briefcase Zama left on the train ? Yeah . I got it right here . It doesn 't look like the same briefcase . It 's the one they gave me , the one they said you gave to the conductor . These aren 't the same journals . - They 've been rewritten . - Mulder ... - They 're gettin ' away with it . - They 've gotten away with it . The bodies at the leper colony are gone . I know what I saw . It wasn 't a leper and it wasn 't human . And I know what I saw at the research facility . It was barely recognisable as human . Don 't you see ? You 're doing their work for them , chasing aliens that aren 't there , ... _ .helping to create a story to cover the truth . What they can 't cover , they apologise for . - Apology has become policy . - I don 't need an apology for the lies . I don 't care about the fictions they create to cover their crimes . I want them held accountable for what did happen . I want an apology for the truth . Fixed Synced By MoUsTaFa ZaKi
